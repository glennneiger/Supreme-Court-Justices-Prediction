mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
like
to
begin
my
remarks
by
clarifying
the
factual
record
a
little
bit.
allow
me
to
say
that
the
fire
occurred
at
about
11:30,
or
just
before
12
'o'
clock
on
january
21st.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
at
night.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
then
while
the
fire
department
was
there
until
4
a.m.
on
january
22nd,
a
lieutenant
lost
and
then
the
fire
department
discovered
gasoline
on
the
premises
and
he
thereupon
called
the
attention
to
chief
see
who
was
the
fire
chief.
he
came
over
and
found
the
gasoline.
at
that
point
chief
see
then
brought
in
detective
webb
and
he
too
looked
at
the
gasoline
and
at
that
point
they
removed
the
gasoline
from
the
premises
and
went
to
the
police
headquarters
and
poured
the
gasoline
that
they
had
removed
from
the
premises
into
another
container
which
was
marked
for
evidence
purposes.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
have
to
concede
that
the
fire
department
had
a
right
to
be
there
to
put
off
fire
and
whatever
they
found
in
the
course
of
being
there
present
for
that
occasion.
they
had
a
right
to
seize
it.
that
much--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
but,
they
have
a
right
to
at
least
identify
it
as
being
cause
for
determining
what
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
was.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
can
only
tell
the
court
what
they
did.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
think
we
have
to
deal
with
the
explosive
nature
and
the
danger
of
gasoline
being
present
in
premises
just
because
it
vaporises.
from
that
context
there
is
a
danger
present
just
because
gasoline
is
vaporising.
i
would
have
to
concede
yes,
there
is
a
danger
present
whether
that
is
the
motive
that
prompted
the
police
officer
and
the
fireman
to
move
the
gasoline
from
the
premises,
i
can
not
say,
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
they
did.
my
own
private
opinion
is
that
we
are
gathering
evidence
because
as
they
indicate
under
cross-examination,
they
admitted
that
at
point
in
time,
before
they
left
the
premises
at
4
a.m.,
they
had
determined
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
and
that
the
gasoline
was
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
persons
i
have
identified,
chief
see
who
is
fire
chief
and
--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
in
my
opinion,
he
is
not
an
expert
but
i
am
telling
you
what
he
determined--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
general
practice
is
in
fire
extinguishment
that
some
body
make
a
determination
of
cause
and
origin,
that
is
usually
done
by
the
fire
department
personnel.
now,
whether
or
not
they
are
experts
and
qualified
to
make
that
judgment--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
my
personal
opinion
is
that
they
once
they
determined
that
gasoline
was
involved.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
in
state
we
do
--
we
have
a
state
fire
marshal.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well
i
can
not
vouch
for
why
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
oh
absolutely.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
they
testified
they
had
determined
the
--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
they
testified
that
they
determine
that
gasoline.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
that
is
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
in
the
state
of
michigan,
the
only
one
who
removes
liquor
from
premises
is
the
department
who
administers
alcohol
licensing,
michigan
liquor
control
commission.
the
liquor
is
destroyed
under
their
direction.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
am
talking
about
removing,
it
also
possesses
what
your
honor
asked.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
think
one
could
well
hypothicate,
he
has
a
duty
to
protect
further
danger
from
developing,
yes.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
can
not
vouch
for
that,
your
honor
because
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
they
generally
do
and
in
michigan
they
do
generally
not
remove
alcohol.
your
honor
please,
the
important
thing
about
the
factual
situation
here
is
that
after
this
conversation
and
identification
of
exhibits
at
police
headquarters
the
fire
department
personnel
withdrew
from
the
fire
scene
leaving
the
premises
unguarded
and
unlocked,
for
four
hours.
now,
some
time
later
that
day
july
20
â€“
i
am
sorry
january
22,
i
can
not
tell
you
because
the
record
does
not
show
at
what
time
of
day,
the
premises
were
locked
by
the
fire
department
but
they
were
locked
and
they
were
boarded
up
and
there
is
ample
photographs
in
the
record
to
show
you
exactly
what
that
building
looked
like
in
its
boarded
up
condition
and
they
were
secured
from
outsiders
coming
in.
it
was
done
by
lieutenant
summer
will
of
the
fire
department.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
for
warrant--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
for
administrative
warrant.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
for
the
judicial
warrant.
from
my
own
personal
experience
any
time
you
have
gasoline
present
a
fire
scene
suspected
of
being
the
accelerant,
i
believe
that
provides
a
reasonable
cause
to
--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
believe
that
under
that
state
of
facts
that
a
reasonable
magistrate
would
have
authorized
the
warrant.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
fire
personnel
cannot
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
fire
would
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
granting
an
administrative
warrant
to
enter
the
premises,
to
determine
what
exact
to
do
--
what
the
cause
and
origin
is,
if
it
is
possible
to
be
done.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
assuming
the
standard
which
you
have
given
me
to
be
factual
then
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
would
be
no
necessity.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
believe
so
because
i
think
that
is
the
only
reason
that
it
exists.
the
fire
department
is
charged
with
a
responsibly
to
keep
track
of
the
cause
of
the
fire.
they
are
unable
to
do
that
in
a
particular
situation
and
the
owner
would
not
give
them
consent
to
enter
the
premises
then
i
believe
that
provides
a
legitimate
basis
to
ask
for
an
administrative
search
warrant
and
it
does
not
impose
a
serious
hardship
or
difficulty
upon
the
fire
department.
it
does
provide
an
additional
safeguard
and
that
a
magistrate
now
sits
between
the
fire
department
or
police
department
and
their
search
for
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
perhaps
the
court
is
not
aware
that
michigan
in
the
same
act
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs
and
petitions
to
justify
the
fire
marshal's
entering
the
premises
also
has
another
section
right
following
it
which
gives
the
fire
marshal
the
right
to
investigate
crime.
if
he
thinks
one
is
precedent,
part
of
that
statute
grants
immunity
if
the
witness
is
called
to
produce
and
give
testimony
against
himself
and
the
procedure
is
there
and
it
is
in
the
fire
act
to
safeguard
the
right
of
the
person
who
is
being
called
upon
to
produce
evidence,
to
explain
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
yes
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
i
think
they
had
ample
grounds
and
basis
in
this
record
to
go
to
the
magistrate
and
ask
for
a
warrant
for
a
criminal
investigation.
not
just
an
administrative
but
a
criminal
because
they
found
gasoline.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
i
think
the
record
will
reflect
the
opposite
your
honor
because
chief
see
and
detective
were
both
indicated
in
cross
examination
in
their
opinion
at
that
point
in
time,
they
suspected
foul
play
and
they
believe
that
arson
had
been
committed.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well
i
am
saying
that
as
soon
as
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
those
suspicions,
yes,
not
just
a
mere
fact
that
they
have
private
suspicion
but
the
fact
that
they
have
to
go
to
a
magistrate
and
lay
those
suspicions
out
and
what
they
consist
of
and
if
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
them
and
if
that
reasonable
basis
is
the
presence
of
gasoline,
i
say
the
magistrate
should
issue
a
warrant.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
i
do
not
believe
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
reviewed
the
fire
marshal's
act
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
adequate.
all
they
have
determined
is
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
was
unreasonable
and
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
oh
yes,
oh
yes,
in
terms
of
requiring
a
warrant.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
they
make
that
comment
in
their
opinion.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
that
is
correct.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
last
page
of
our
appendix
indicates
the
owner's
statement,
he
could
not
get
a
thing
out
of
that
building.
the
fire
department
had
in
effect
seized
and
sealed
it
off.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
sir?
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
he
did
abandon
the
building,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
sir.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
that
is
right.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
record
reflects
that
he
went
to
the
building
and
that
there
was
various
points
in
time
when
anyone
may
enter
the
building
because
the
vandal
would
frequently
pull
apart
the
board
which
boarded
up
the
windows
and
freely
enter
the
building.
and
in
this
manner,
he
had
entered
the
building
himself,
i
am
sure,
now
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
he
did
enter.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
record
would
reflect
that.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
only
things
that
he
did
to
keep
people
out
of
the
building
is
not
--
the
statements
of
what
he
did
prior
to
the
fire
occurred.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
record
does
not
contain
any
evidences
as
to
what
he
did
to
protect
the
building
from
invasion
by
anyone.
that
is
right.
there
is
absolutely
no
disclosure
in
the
record
as
to
that.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
sir,
not
in
this
record.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
so
far
as
the
furniture
and
the
contents
that
were
in
the
building
were
concerned,
they
were
fairly
well
destroyed.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
sir.
the
things
which
were
not
destroyed
of
course
were
the
business
records
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
fire
department
and
or
the
police
department,
no
i
guess
it
was
the
state
police,
state
fire
marshall's
division
took
a
box
of
records,
business
records
to
the
fingerprint
laboratory
for
purposes
of
having
fingerprints
taken
off.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
the
record
would
reflect
that
sergeant
hoffman
who
is
from
the
state
fire
marshall's
office
told
my
client
mr.
tyler,
he
was
not
to
remove
anything
from
the
building,
that
is
in
the
record.
in
fact,
when
they
went
there
to
get
on
january
29th,
there
is
a
discussion
between
them
and
it
is
on
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
not
in
my
opinion.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well
like
i
said
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
we
did
not
go
into
court
because
we
did
not
need
to.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no.
your
honor
please,
what
happened
was
the
police
and
firemen
locked
up
the
building
but
vandals
kept
breaking
it
open.
anyone
could
and
did
that
if
they
wanted
to
go
into
that
building.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
he
was
denied
the
right
to
remove
documents
from,
evidence
from
the
building
according
to
sergeant
hoffman.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
did
not,
i
do
not
think
i
represented
him
at
that
time
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
not
according
to
the
record.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
because
he
was
still
paying
rent
on
the
building
your
honor.
and
that
is
in
the
record.
not
only
he
was
paying
rent
on
the
building,
he
had
his
records.
what
was
remaining
of
his
business
records
in
the
file
and
sergeant
hoffman
told
him,
he
was
not
to
take
those
from
the
building
because
he
wanted
to
preserve
them
as
evidence.
my
client
not
knowing
any
better
yield
it
to
his
direction
an
order.
now
i
did
not
goto
court
and
ask
for
an
order
to
receive
those
records.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
know,
i
understand
it,
nor
did
anyone
else
according
to
the
record.
the
thing
that
intrigues
me
about
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
justifiably
concluded
from
the
testimony
of
the
participants
that
this
was
in
fact
a
criminal
investigation
from
the
early
morning
hours
of
january
22nd
beginning
with
chief
see's
declaration
as
to
what
the
cause
and
origin
was.
i
think
that
is
significant
when
you
view
what
was
done
here
by
the
authorities
as
the
government's
representative
in
literally
sealing
of
this
building
and
keeping
the
occupant
from
his
records,
that
in
effect
we
have
not
only
a
specific
seizure
but
we
have
a
total
seizure
of
all
business
records
and
the
so
called
tools
of
the
crime.
now
unfortunately,
my
brothers
want
a
bootstrap,
the
jury
determination
that
there
was
an
arson
committed
by
my
clients
to
say
that
because
of
such
a
determination,
they
have
no
expectation
of
privacy
which
this
court
or
the
constitution
of
michigan
or
of
united
states
protect
and
that
to
me
is
nothing
more
than
saying
that
the
--
and
justifies
the
means,
and
i
just
cannot
accept
that
kind
of
reasoning
to
say
that
there
cannot
be
any
expectation
of
privacy
simply
because
there
has
been
a
determination
that
an
arson
has
been
convened.
it
also
runs
up
against
the
presumption
of
innocence
when
this
representative
of
the
government
is
seeking
evidence,
if
he
forms
an
opinion
whether
it
be
reasonable
or
not
that
the
occupant
has
been
guilty
of
the
crime
of
arson,
that
should
not
by
itself
extinguish
any
expectation
of
privacy
nor
should
it
give
the
government
the
right
to
intrude
as
it
did
in
this
case
totally
by
sealing
off
the
premises.
particularly,
under
circumstances
of
where
we
have
the
department,
both
the
fire
department
and
the
police
department
involved.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
only
to
the
extent
of
the
scope
of
the
invasion
your
honor,
because
i
think
they
took
more
than
they
needed
to
take
in
terms
of
a
reasonable
search
that
they
had
want
in
the
first
place.
let
us
assume
they
had
a
warrant
to
search
for
a
criminal
cause
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
give
them
the
right
to
take
possession
of
entire
premises.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
unfortunately
we
did
not
develop
that
in
evidence.
that
is
correct,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
one
way
or
the
other,
how
my
client
felt
about
it?
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
i
do
not
know
about
the
cardboard
furniture
but
i
do
know
about
his
business
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
one
would
have
a
hard
time
convincing
this
court
that
he
would
want
his
cardboard
deposits
in
the
fire
scene
to
be
returned
but
of
more
significance
are
his
private
records,
his
business
records.
because
now
we
are
talking
about
possible
fifth
amendment
implications.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
there
is
absolutely
in
the
record
to
indicate
there
was
inherit
danger
present
after
the
fire
department
left
the
scene.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
i
did
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
can
guarantee
you
your
honor
they
do
it
everyday
in
michigan,
everyday--
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
your
honor.
but
they
were
seized.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
no
i
only
offer
that
as
an
extent
of
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
here.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
that
part
is
true
your
honor,
but
i
think
in
looking
at
what
took
place
i
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
invasion
by
the
governmental
authority.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
do
not
believe
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
not
unless
they
obtained
that
evidence
through
the
means
of
a
warrant,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
believe
that
they
would
be
improper
your
honor
because
they
represent
a
search,
they
do
not
represent
a
seizure
but
at
least
the
represent
the
search.
the
photograph
is
the
next
best
substitute
for
giving
a
visual
presentation
to
the
triar.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
would
think
so
your
honor
on
the
theory
of
search
being
just
what
it
is,
a
search
and
without
a
warrant,
i
do
not
want
to
appear
to
not
acknowledge
that
when
the
fire
department
is
there
for
the
purpose
of
putting
out
the
fire.
they
have
every
right
in
the
world
to
look
and
see
what
is
there
to
be
seen.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
at
the
time
they
are
there
for
putting
out
the
fire
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
that
is
right
and
that
is
why.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
if
they
are
legally
on
the
premises
and
i
assume
by
that
your
honor
means
they
have
obtained
a
warrant.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
yes
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well
i
think
then
that
is
part
of
being
in
the
on
the
premises
in
the
lawful
function.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
yes
sir
i
believe
so.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well
unfortunately
there
is
nothing
spelled
out
in
the
statute
in
reference
to
a
procedure
as
to
what
magistrate
to
go
before
to
obtain
warrant
in
an
administrative
area.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
think
the
whole
phraseology
has
come
out
of
the
camara
decisions
in
terms
of
recognizing
a
differentiation
between
an
administrative
search
of
the
premises
and
a
criminal
search
and
from
that
distinction
has
now
emerged
the
new
language
administrative
warrant.
unfortunately
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
legislative
pronouncements
as
to
how
that
is
to
be
implemented
nor
at
this
point
are
there
any
judicial
decisions
that
spell
out
how
it
should
be
done.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
we
do
have
a
statute
which
is
been
alluded
to
already
your
honor,
which
allows
the
fire
marshall
if
he
suspects
a
crime
a
procedure
of
testimony
and
subpoena
by
which
he
can
require
people
to
bring
in
records
and
evidence
and
part
of
that
statute
also
grants
immunity
to
anybody
who
brings
in
such
evidence.
now,
that
does
not
answer
your
question
but
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
know
of
in
michigan
law
at
this
time
that
comes
close
to
answering
your
question.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
in
my
opinion,
after
they
found
gasoline
they
had
reasonable
cause
if
they
wanted
to
pinpoint
as
they
appeared
to
do.
they
wanted
to
pinpoint
with
exact
accuracy,
how
the
gasoline
got
triggered
to
cause
the
fire.
then
all
they
had
to
do
was
go
to
the
local
circuit
court
and
ask
for
a
criminal
search
warrant
in
the
usual
manner.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
yes
sir.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
think
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
that
it
is
admissible
in
evidence
because
the
fire
personnel
from
the
description
are
still
on
the
premises
in
this
function
of
putting
out
the
fire
in
determining
the
cause.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
well,
not
only
the
fact
that
they
went
home
your
honor,
the
fact
that
they
went
home
and
left
the
premises
unguarded
for
four
hours.
that
i
think
is
significant
because
that
to
me
indicates
an
abandonment.
they
were
through.
now
had
they
wished
to
do
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
and
kept
fire
department
personnel
there
and
they
do,
do
that
your
honor.
they
do
seal
off
premises
for
24
and
48
hours.
it
is
not
unusual
in
michigan.
but,
in
this
case
they
did
not.
they
went
home
for
four
hours.
mr.
jesse
r.
bacalis
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
facts
are
in
the
record.
it
is
my
remark
unless
you
have
some
more
questions?
