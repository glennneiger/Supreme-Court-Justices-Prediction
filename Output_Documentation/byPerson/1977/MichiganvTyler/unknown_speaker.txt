unknown
speaker
well,
now
the
statue
says,
the
state
statute
says
that
the
director
or
any
officer
is
authorized
to
investigate
and
inquire,
it
does
not
direct
him
to
--
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
say
in
an
answer
to
the
question
of
chief
justice
that
he
does
in
fact
investigate
the
cause
or
origin
of
every
single
fire,
large
and
small?
unknown
speaker
is
this
statue
is
simply
an
authorizing
statute.
it
is
a
not
a
directory
statute.
but
you
say
that
in
practice
he
will
be
under
a
duty
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
and
does
do
it?
unknown
speaker
in
every
case
where
there
is
loss
of
life
or
damage
to
property.
unknown
speaker
well
i
am
assuming
it
been
reported
to
fire
department.
there
is
always
damage
to
property
in
a
fire,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
say
real
property.
pretty
hard
a
damage
real
property
in
fire.
unknown
speaker
did
not
the
michigan
court
construe
the
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
are
quite
rebound
by
the
michigan
construction.
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
that
is
relevant
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
did
i
correctly
understand
your
view
is
that
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
should
survive
until
the
cause
of
the
fire
is
determined?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
might
take
a
year
or
two?
if
the
building
has
been
reconstructed,
would
it
still
survive
that
long?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
just
locks
the
premises
and
secures
them
against
entry
by
third
parties?
unknown
speaker
would
that
ever
terminate
the
exigency
exception.
unknown
speaker
but
can
we
do
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
at
the
time
of
the
search
where
they
found
that
the
fuse
and
the
glass
or
whatever
it
was,
some
22
or
23
days
later,
the
premises
were
locked
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
why
did
that
not
terminate
the
exigency
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
under
your
view
of
the
law
the
search
was
improper,
if
i
understand
you?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
excluded,
i
mean
it
was
received
over
objection,
it
was
found
on
january
22
or
whatever
date
it
was,
about
three
or
four
weeks
later.
don't
you
have
to
sustain
that
search
in
order
to
sustain
the
conviction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
i
want
to
be
sure.
are
there
not
three
pieces
of
evidence
here,
the
first
what
they
picked
up
at
the
time
of
the
fire,
that
is
plastic
container
--
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
objection
to
its
submission
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
the
second
piece
was
what
was
discovered
at
the
day
light
entry
the
very
next
day.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
submitted
over
objection
and
is
at
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
third
one,
am
i
correct
was
two
or
three
weeks
later?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
we
have
these
three
levels
of
evidence,
two
of
which
are
under
challenge
at
this
court.
unknown
speaker
when
you
talk
about
a
warrant
requirement
as
imposed
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
here,
what
inquiry
would
the
magistrate
make
in
order
to
justify
the
issue
on
civil
warrant.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
satisfied
of
the
rule
that
you
could
enter
the
building
any
time
you
wanted
to
after
a
fire,
and
hunt
for
evidence
and
the
cause
but
then
nothing
you
found
could
be
admitted
an
evidence
in
the
criminal
prosecution
unless
you
had
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
you
really
want
to
gather
to
any
evidence,
aren't
you?
it
is
a
criminal
investigation
among
other
thing.
unknown
speaker
now,
why
is
this
arson
crime
any
different
than
any
other
crime
in
terms
of
your
ability
to
enter
property
to
find
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you
could
server
that
in
by
agreeing
not
to
use
the
evidence
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
unless
you
had
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
are
saying
that
only
arsonists
can
object
to
entry,
to
a
property
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
like
a
man
who
shoots
his
children?
he
is
done
something
pretty
bad,
that
you
can
not
enter
his
house
and
search
his
property
without
a
warrant,
just
to
find
evidence
of
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
just
what
does
a
magistrate
do
if
you
have
to
get
a
warrant,
if
you
went
to
prove
a
fire
took
place
and
some
damage
was
incurred,
isn't
he
automatically
going
to
issue
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
that
is
only
on
the
assumption
that
you
need
not
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
whereas
if
you
assume
that
while
you
have
assumed
the
case
away.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
--
you
are
assuming
the
case
away
again.
when
the
marshall
begins,
is
he
looking
for
a
crime
or
is
he
looking
for
a
cause
of
a
fire?
unknown
speaker
and
incidentally,
he
may
then
come
to
the
conclusion
later
that
it
was
self-inflicted,
that
is,
that
it
was
arson,
but
does
it
become
a
criminal
investigation,
right
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
the
medical
examiner
go
into
a
house
to
find
the
cause
of
the
death?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
without
a
warrant,
five
days
later,
can
he
--
the
door
is
locked,
can
he
break
in?
and
find
the
evidence
of
what
killed
the
person.
unknown
speaker
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
okay,
does
he
needs
a
warrant
or
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
private
house,
private
property?
unknown
speaker
all
it
was
to
find
out,
is
a
cause
of
death,
we
are
saying
that
it
maybe
very
much,
a
great
evidence
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
no
question
about
somebody,
about
--
no
question
that
somebody's
died,
the
body
is
in
a
morgue
but
the
medical
examiner
would
like
to
get
into
somebody's
house
to
find
out
what
killed
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
cannot
he
go
in
the
house
and
find
out
the
cause
of
death,
that
is
all
he
wants
to
know.
he
is
supposed
to
make
out
a
death
certificate.
he
does
not
know,
so
he
would
like
to
go
find
out.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
this
person
had
locked
and
when
this
fire
was
put
out
and
put
his
own
locks
on
his
premises,
would
there
warrant
have
to
be
obtained
to
get
in?
unknown
speaker
how
about
this
circumstance,
if
he
had
locked
them,
if
he
had
locked
the
door,
the
fireman
put
the
fire
out
and
went
away
and
instead
of
the
fire
department
putting
locks
â€“
locking
it
up,
he
did.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
does
the
record
tell
us,
at
the
time
of
the
search
on
february
16th,
the
building
was
locked
as
i
understand
it,
who
had
keys
to
the
building
at
that
time?
just
the
fire
people
or
did
the
--
did
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
distinguish
at
all
between
business
premises
and
a
home
for
purposes
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
did
you
hear
argument
in
the
osha
case
yesterday
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
mr,
butler
let
me
add
to
your
troubles
if
i
may.
as
you
know
we
take
the
state
law
as
construed
by
the
court
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
other
choice.
my
question
is
suggested
by
an
earlier
question
by
my
brother
powell.
in
this
case
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
pointed
out
that
the
statute
itself
is
silent
as
to
a
warrant
requirement,
it
does
not
say
when
it
is
is
required
does
not
say
when
it
is
not
required
but
it
said
as
the
state
court,
we
are
now
construing
the
law,
the
state
law
of
michigan
as
requiring
a
warrant.
now,
therefore,
do
not
we
have
before
us
a
state
law
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
your
state
that
in
fact
requires
a
warrant
in
this
situation
and
if
that
is
true
is
there
any
federal
question
before
this
court.
unknown
speaker
they
did
construe
their
state
law
as
requiring
a
warrant
in
these
situations.
the
statute
and
then
we
take
the
combination
of
what
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
and
construction
of
it
put
on
it
by
the
michigan
courts.
and
the
michigan
courts
now
tell
us
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
michigan
as
a
matter
of
state
law
requires
a
warrant
in
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
how
they
did
it
maybe
they
could
not
read
but
however
they
did
it
this
is
what
they
tell
us
the
state
law
requires.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
zakini
case
late
last
term
which
i
thinks
supports
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
supposing
the
state
legislature
had
expressly
drafted
a
statute
requiring
a
warrant
and
the
legislative
history
showed
that
legislatures
only
did
it
because
they
thought
the
federal
constitution
required
it.
they
said
we
really
do
not
want
this
requirement
we
think
the
supreme
court
will
impose
it
on
us,
could
we
ignore
that
statute
because
they
acted
under
a
misguided
interpretation
of
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but
here
you
are
saying
that
even
though
the
states
supreme
court
is
clear
and
what
it
tells
us
the
statute
means
we
should
change
that
because
we
think
they
may
have
acted
on
an
incorrect
premise.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
basis
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
established
law
around
that
says
that
you
need
not
show
the
probable
cause
to
believe
the
crime
has
been
committed?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
talking
about
what
the
federal
constitution
does
or
does
not
require,
what
authority
is
there
for
saying
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
you
can
investigate
an
arson
by
entering
property
without
showing
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
camara,
you
say
that
your
principle
cases.
unknown
speaker
we
are
just
suggesting
perhaps
some
of
us
that
you
do
not
necessarily
have
a
crime
involved
so
far
as
investigation
is
concerned.
is
that
not
the
duty
of
the
fire
department
under
your
system
to
find
out
the
cause
of
a
fire
among
other
things
to
prevent
its
recurrence
under
similar
circumstances,
there
might
be
no
arson
involved?
unknown
speaker
it
strikes
me
you
have
something
not
dissimilar
to
an
internal
revenue
service
investigation
that
initially
might
be
all
just
to
determine
that
everything
has
been
included
and
that
develop
into
a
full
fledged
criminal
investigation.
sometimes
depending
on
what
they
find.
unknown
speaker
at
night?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
well
they
certainly
did
not
have
a
right
to
permanently
take
whatever
they
found
there,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
reason
they
would
remove
the
gasoline
if
they
thought
it
was
gasoline
so
that
they
fire
might
not
reignite
between
four
in
the
morning
and
daylight
i
suppose,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
just
to
understand
that
what
your
view
of
the
record
might
be
perhaps
it
is
not
a
issue
here
suppose
the
fire
department
or
the
investigators
had
got
a
magistrate
and
said
we
want
authority
to
search
the
building,
they
went
there
the
morning
immediately
after
the
fire,
and
said
and
here
is
what
we
found
and
here
is
what
we
want.
we
want
authority
to
search,
we
want
authority
to
board
up
the
building
to
avoid
any
destruction
of
evidence,
would
there
have
been
ample
bases
for
a
warrant
issue?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
no,
for
a
judicial
warrant.
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
had
gone
to
the
magistrate,
you
think
the
warrant
could
have
issued
for
further
searching
--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
call
an
administrative
warrant
if
you
are
talking
about
the
magistrate.
that
is
a
judicial
warrant.
isn't
it?
it
is
not
just
a
warrant
issued
by
the
executive
branch
or
the
administrative
branch.
unknown
speaker
mr
bacalis,
i
have
one
problem,
you
could
actually
help
me
with,
the
key
to
the
premises
was
retained
by
the
public
authority,
usually
the
fire
marshal--
unknown
speaker
did
the
owner
of
the
premises
or
the
tenant
have
access
at
all?
or
did
he
demand
access
at
all,
it
is
kind
of
a
strange
privacy
interest
where
he
can
get
his
own
--
?
unknown
speaker
did
he
make
any
effort
to
remove
the
contents
of
the
building
like
the
furniture
that
had
not
been
sold
presumably
something
was
not
damaged?
i
do
not
know.
unknown
speaker
they
were,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
a
kind
of
a
strange
privacy
interest
where
an
owner
does
not
even
ask
to
get
his
records
back
or
anything
back
and
let
somebody
else
have
the
key
to
the
place
for
about
a
month.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
statutory
authority
for
a
public
official
taking
possession
of
premises
like
these?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
indicate
any
condition
of
inherent
dangerousness
after
the
fire
in
the
structure?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bacalis,
your
emphasis
on
the
business
records
i
can
not
recall,
were
they
admitted
in
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
they
are
not
really
before
us.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
the
constitutional
question
that
we
are
supposed
to
decide
here,
precisely
the
same
as
if
there
had
never
been
any
business
record
in
the
place
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
mr.
bacalis,
there
has
been
no
gasoline
found
in
the
course
of
putting
out
the
fire,
no
evidence
of
the
cause
at
that
time
but
the
fire
department
has
a
duty
to
determine
cause,
whether
there
is
a
crime
suspected
or
not
so
the
fire
department
does
or
does
the
next
day
get
in
a
so
called
administrative
warrant
but
it
nevertheless
comes
back
either
with
or
without
the
warrant
looks
around
the
property
and
it
determines
cause
right
there
on
the
spot
and
it
determines
it
from
the
fact
that
finds
some
gas
and
unimpeachable
evidence
that
there
was
arson
and
it
finds
the
cause
and
it
takes
away,
is
that
admissible
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
think
that
without
a
warrant,
without
a
probable
cause
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate,
the
public
authorities
are
entitled
to
determine
cause
but
if
they
find
evidence
of
a
crime
they
cannot
admit
it?
they
cannot
introduce
it
unless
they
have
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
see
some
evidence
of
what
caused
the
fire,
even
though
it
might
indicate
a
crime,
they
can
take
it.
unknown
speaker
all
you
are
saying
is
that
if
they
are
legally
on
the
premises
they
can
cease
evidence
of
crime
that
in
plain
sight.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
next
day
if
they
are
legally
on
the
premises
and
if
there
is
an
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
let
us
assume
that
suppose
they
have
no
evidence
the
night
before
that
there
has
been
any
crime
committed
but
they
must
determine
cause,
are
you
not
suggesting
they
need
to
show
probable
cause
of
some
crime
before
they
can
go
back
on
the
premises
to
determine
the
cause
they
can
at
least
get
an
administrative
warrant
and
go
back
in.
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
they
get
the
administrative
warrant
as
you
call
it
whatever
that
is
and
they
are
legally
on
the
premises,
you
would
agree
they
are
legally
on
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
well
and
then
they
find
some
evidence.
unknown
speaker
legally,
so
they
could
then
introduce
their
evidence
that
they
legally
find.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bacalis,
did
you
want
in
this
case,
before
the
second
day
when
they
went
in,
where
should
they
have
gone
and
what
should
they
have
gotten?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
a
judicial
search
warrant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bacalis.
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
justice
white's
factual
assumptions
little
stickier,
because
i
am
concerned
about
what
they
found
the
very
next
morning,
when
daylight
came.
assume
that
they
found
something
that
was
not
visible
at
night
but
was
visible
in
the
daytime.
and
further
assume
instead
of
leaving
at
4
a.m.,
the
fire
department
just
stayed
there
until
the
sun
came
up
and
then
they
picked
it
up,
admissible
in
evidence
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fire
was
out
at
4
a.m.
and
they
were
just
waiting
now
for
the
sun
to
rise
so
they
can
see
the
little
mark,
and
then
it
would
be
admissible,
in
fact
they
went
home
and
came
back,
it
makes
it
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
the
shift
did
not
change?
unknown
speaker
has
it
ever
been
issued
in
connection
with
a
fire
situation,
to
your
knowledge?
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
under
your
view
of
the
case,
who
had
possession
of
the
premises
on
february
16th?
unknown
speaker
under
your
view
of
the
back
situation,
who
had
possession
of
the
premises
on
february
16th?
unknown
speaker
mr.
butler,
until
the
decision
of
this
case
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
what
do
you
consider
the
law
of
michigan
to
have
been
on
this
subject?
unknown
speaker
upheld?
unknown
speaker
it
required
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
require
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not
require
a
warrant.
and
what
the
fourth
case
was?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
denowitz
case.
unknown
speaker
and
in
michigan
courts
of
appeals
were
relatively
recent,
they
act
only
(inaudible)
due
constitution.
unknown
speaker
the
65.
your
courts
of
appeals
have
territorial
jurisdiction.
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
not
like
the
federal
system
where
there
could
be
a
conflict
between
them.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
you
to
say
that
denowitz
case
was
subsequently
overruled
by
two
other
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
two
panel.
unknown
speaker
so
at
the
time
of
this
fire,
in
fact
as
in
michigan
operating
under
decisions
of
your
appellate
court
had
the
authority
to
do
what
they
did?
unknown
speaker
dajnowicz
(ph)
case
was
in
1972.
unknown
speaker
so
they
were
acting
in
accordance
for
their
understanding
for
the
law
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
has
the
four
courts
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
you
have
referred
to
was
the
dajnowicz
(ph)
case
but
not
the
most
recent.
unknown
speaker
who
wrote
the
dajnowicz
(ph)
opinion?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
even
under
the
denowitz
case,
the
nine
o'
clock
siege,
the
second
siege
would
have
been
perfectly
valid
because
i
have
read
that
case,
that
said
that
at
the
time
of
the
fire
or
probably
thereafter,
was
authority
to
siege
withour
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
now
these
court
of
appeals
opinions
that
you
have
been
discussing
were
they
placed
on
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
or
on
the
state
constitution
of
michigan?
