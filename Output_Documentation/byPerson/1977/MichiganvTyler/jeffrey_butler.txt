mr.
jeffrey
butler
this
arson
case
presents
the
questions
of
when
and
to
what
extend
of
warrant
is
to
be
required
for
post
fire
and
by
analogy
other
post
disaster
investigations
and
of
which
evidence
is
admissible
against
in
particular
arsonists
who
burn
their
own
buildings.
the
case
arises
as
out
of
facts
which
were
the
most
part
are
typical
of
any
arson
for
profit
case
with
two
small
exceptions
which
we
plan
to
elaborate
upon
later
in
argument.
in
relating
the
facts
and
in
attempting
to
justify,
a
warrant
was
post
fire
searches
in
general
as
well
as
the
searches
which
occurred
in
particular
in
this
case.
we
have
four
principle
themes.
the
first
is
that
the
public
interest
in
a
post
disaster
or
post
fire
search
is
significantly
greater
than
the
public
interest
in
any
inspection
of
the
type
touched
upon
and
dealt
with
in
camara,
say
and
secretary
of
state
against
barlow.
the
second
theme
is
that
the
privacy
interests
at
issue
as
well
as
the
potential
for
abuse
are
very
minimal,
primarily
because
of
the
extensive
damage
that
has
taken
place.
the
extent
of
the
already
lawful
intrusion
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
search
for
the
cause
or
the
origin
of
the
fire.
third,
we
contend
that
a
warrant
in
circumstances
like
these
whether
administrative
or
criminal
will
provide
no
protection
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
very
little
protection
in
a
very
limited
class
of
cases.
our
fourth
theme
is
that,
a
fire
investigation,
there
are
certain
costs,
in
fire
investigation
and
in
public
safety
to
require
any
kind
of
administrative
search
warrant.
the
general
interest
in
a
search,
in
conducting
a
search
of
this
type
are
several.
the
cause
itself
must
be
determined
first
as
some
type
of
exigent
circumstance.
this
is
a
theme
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
seem
not
to
acknowledge.
now
we
grant
that,
it
did
say
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
the
possibility
of
danger,
of
evidence
burning,
of
danger
to
the
fireman
conducting
the
investigation,
danger
of
water
damage
to
the
evidence
that
then
they
will
excuse
us
a
search
that
takes
place
at
that
time,
but
we
think
they
should
have
concluded
that
until
the
clause
is
determined
there
should
be
a
presumption
if
there
is
an
exigent
circumstance.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
there
is
a
local
statue
which
requires
the
local
fire
marshal
to
determine
that
conduct
a
physical
investigation
to
determine
a
cause
or
origin
of
fire,
and
it
states
that
he
may
enter
without
warrant
any
premises
for
making
that
determination.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
if
not
that
specific
statute,
it
is
clear
that
under
the
fire
prevention
act,
he
does
have
the
duty
to
determine
the
cause
or
origin
of
all
fires
that
result
in
property
damage
or
death.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
statute
reads
where
there
is
injury
or
damage
to
property,
he
would
have
to
investigate
any
fire
that
is
called
to
his
attention,
very
small
fires
that
you
would
never
hear
of
course
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
he
does
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
is
brought
to
his
attention.
now
it
is
a
very
small
fire
that,
i
mean
of
course
that
is
never
reported
to
any
fire
department.
no
he
does
not
do
that.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
not
always
to
real
property.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
am
saying
real
property,
the
building
as
well
your
honor,
that
is
determined
by
that
term.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
believe
that
he
construed
the
state
statute
to
require
a
warrant
only
to
make
it
constitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment.
but
they
did
read
a
warrant
requirement
in
to
that
statute.
we
claim
that
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
do
that
because
it
is
simply
not
the
intent
of
the
legislature
because
they
surely
should
be
presumed
to
know
that
any
fire
investigator
can
(inaudible)
with
the
warrant,
so
by
very
clear
implications,
it
would
seem
that
the
statute
on
states
would
seem
to
allow
warrant
searches.
that
is
the
court
said
the
statute
did
not
speak
to
the
question.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
do
not
believe
it
will
be
bound
by,
if
their
construction
depended
upon
an
erroneous
view
only
the
fourth
amendment.
if
it
depended
upon
any
another
view
of
michigan
law
then
the
court
would
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
not
if
the
owner
occupant
had
somehow
re-taken
over
the
premises
and
moved
something
back
in
or
any
other
way
it
indicated
that
he
is
either
living
in
them
or
using
it
as
an
operational--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
a
lot
of
that
would
depend
upon
precisely
when
he
did
that.
we
contend
that
fire
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
it
certainly
would
at
some
point
we
can--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no
in
this
case
the
proprietor
of
the
premises
was
out
of
state
for
about
seven
days
after
the
fire.
until
about
seven
days
after
the
fire--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
they
were
locked
and
sealed
by
the
fire
department
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
clearly
did
--
by
the
time
of
that
search
the
exigency
was
terminated.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no
your
honor
we
attempt
--
we
believe
there
is
additional
justification
for
that
search.
we
are
speaking
now
primarily
of
the
search
that
occurred
the
morning
following
the
fire.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
had
to
sustain
that
search,
yes
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
believe
we
have
to
sustain
it
under
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
fire
department
perhaps
in
conjunction
with
the
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor,
the
fire
was
put
out
at
approximately
4
a.m.
on
january
22
at
which
time
the
fire
department
boarded
up
all
the
windows
and
put
their
own
locks
and
chains
on
all
the
doors
and
then
re-entered
at
eight
o'
clock,
the
next
morning,
and
found
what
we
agreed
was
indeed
the
cause
of
the
fire
by
that
time.
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
in
the
course
of
putting
out
the
fire
between
midnight
and
approximately
4
a.m
on
january
22nd
that
the
finding
only
of
two
plastic
bottles,
one
partially
filled
with
gasoline
was
itself
the
cause
of
the
fire
and
that
enabled
them,
that
gave
them
enough
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
we
are
contending
that
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
at
least
it
is
â€“
it
was
not
challenged
in
the
court
below
and
nor
here.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
about
three
or
four
weeks
later
there
was
a
re-entry,
the
reason
for
the
re-entry
was
that
the
photographs
taken
by
an
arson
investigator
were
lost
in
the
mail.
he
apparently
re-entered
to
retake
some
odd
photographs
and
while
doing
that
found
a
piece
of
fuse
and
pieces
of
glass
and
debris
and
those
items
were
admitted
in--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
is
correct
your
honor
however
in
order
to
make
this
case
re-triable
under
the
opinion
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
really
there
were
other
entries
into
the
building
and
the
principles
of
the
opinion
below
would
not
allow
for
example,
oral
testimony
by
an
arson
investigator
who
went
in
four
days
after
the
fire.
had
he
taken
photographs
or
found
physical
evidence,
it
is
clear
that
they
would
have
been
challenged.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
only
possible
inquiry
which
we
can
imagine
is
simply
whether
or
not
a
fire
occurred.
it
seems
that
if
an
search
warrant
is
to
be
allowed
is
to
required
to
re-enter
and
determine
the
cause
or
origin
of
the
fire,
all
that
we
should
be
able
to
have
to
show
is
that
a
fire
occurred.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
well,we
can
show
that
the
fire
occurred
by
the
condition
of
the
building.
i
mean
that
is
what
we
say
that
the
fire
occurred.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
am
not
sure
if
your
honors
is
suggesting
that
we
need
a
criminal
warrant,
if
that
is
the
case
then
there
is
close
question
of
whether
those
two
bottles
of
gasoline
are
sufficient
to
prove
that
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
if
we
think
if
just
an
administrative
warrant
is
required
to
determine
the
cause
or
origin
of
the
fire,
then
the
only
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no,
we
are
not,
we
have
used
repeatedly
throughout
the
brief
that
i
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
well,
the
entry
is
one
intrusion
and
what
they
do
inside
is
something
else.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes,
they
did,
it
searched
for
the
cause
or
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes,
your
honor.
interim
search.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no,
we
would
be
very
dissatisfied
with
the
rule
like
that
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
among
other
things
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
think
it
is
different
because
there
is
a
legitimate
need
to
enter
the
property
anyway,
to
make
a
valid
civil
inspection
and
search
for
the
cause
of
the
fire.
another
respect
in
which
it
is
different
is
that
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
would
be
the
most
perverse
imaginable
your
honor
because
that
would
say,
and
it
is
alright
to
make
these
searches
because
there
is
a
public
interest
for
them,
but
we
are
making
one
exception
and
give
a
benefit
only
to
arsonists
and
say
that
the
evidence
can
not
be
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
are
saying
that
a
arsonists
are
in
a
special
class
and
that
the
way
they
have
treated
their
own
property,
suggests
that
they
have
no
protectable
interest
and
no
interest
remaining
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
by
nearly
any
test
except
one
which
requires
total
abandonment
of
any
property
interests
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
is
true
your
honor,
we
are
not
contending
that
he
somehow
as
punishment
for
his
crime
loses
a
right.
we
would
make
the
same
analysis,
if
arson
for
profit
were
not
a
crime.
our
point
is
that
the
way
he
treats
his
own
property,
the
actions
which
make
up
the
crime
of
arson
also
speak
to
what
expectation
he
has
in
his
own
premises,
and
they
say
that
he
has
none.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
if
we
see
a
gun
shot
in
a
building
and
i
think
they
can
usually
go
in
without
a
warrant,
just
because
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
just
because
a
crime
is
then
committed
in
a
building
does
not
waive
any
kind
of
privacy
or
protection--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
except
the
arson
of
your
own
building.
we
think
that
the
deliberate
destruction
of
someone's
owned
property
is
so
inconsistent
with
any
notion
of
how
the
law
is
supposed
to
protect
private
property,
that
in
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
waive
at
least
temporarily
any
fourth
amendment
protection
in
the
arsonists
owned
building.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
is
precisely
our
point,
your
honor,
that
needs
no
exercise
in
terms
of
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
okay,
if
we
are
speaking
of
administrative
warrants,
then
you
do
not
need
any
probable
cause
to
show
that
a
crime
has
occurred.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
he
is
looking
for
the
cause
of
a
fire,
which
may--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
not
at
the
outset,
it
cannot.
the
point
is
once
there
is
evidence
of
arson
discovered,
it
becomes
--
arson
is
still
a
cause
of
a
fire
and
as
far
as
using
fire
experience
as
a
yard
stick
to
test
the
success
of
fire
codes
that
says
that
this
was
not
a
breakdown
of
the
fire
prevention
system.
this
was
deliberately
cause.
but,
at
the
same
time,
of
course,
it
is
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes,
he
can,
immediately.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
would
think
in
almost
any
circumstances,
yes.
your
honor
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
speaking
of
an
exigent
circumstance
where
a
body
is
discovered
that
appears
to
have
died
of
unnatural
causes,
it
--
now
he
cannot
break
into
an
occupied
home.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
your
honor
those
factors--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
would
depend
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
circumstances
that
would
arise
where
that
he
would
have
noticed
somehow
that
there
is
a
dead
body
that
has
been
dead
for
five
days
and
yet
it
is
in
a
completely
locked
house
where
someone
is
denying
admission
to
the
public.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
oh,
no
clearly
not
your
honor,
i
misunderstood
the
question,
i
thought
the
body
was
in
the
house.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
are
dealing
with
a
fully
occupied
home
or
business
that
has
all
the
traditional
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
under
most
circumstances
we
would
say,
yes.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
still
contend
that
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
how
he
treats
the
property,
that
is
by
putting
a
lock
on
it,
we
should
also
look
at
what
he
has
done
to
the
property
to
bring
it
into
that
condition,
he
has
deliberately
destroyed
it.
he
has
attempted
to
sell
it
back
to
the
insurance
company
involuntarily,
which
indicates
he
does
not
want
it
any
more.
he
is
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
whenever
the
issue
is
raised
in
a
suppression
hearing
or
on
appeal,
the
court
will
always
have
before
it
the
facts
which
indicate
what
he
did.
it
is
his
guilt,
this
will
be
established
to
some
legal
degree.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
is
true
that
at
the
time
they
entered,
they
may
not
have
the
evidence,
that
occupant
burned
it
himself,
that
is
true,
we
are
saying
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
maybe
evidence
of
arson,
i
am
not
sure
its
evidence
that
he
burnt
that
he
did
himself.
it
could
have
been
a
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
think
that
is
very
slim
evidence
of
arson,
we
doubt
that
a
warrant
would
ever
issue
simply
upon
a
statement
that
two
plastic
bottles
of
gasoline
were
found
in
a
burned
building,
that
seems
equally
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
is
consistent
with
innocent
fire
as
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no,
your
honor,
it
was
retail
furniture
store.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
cleaning,
at
the
time
they
just
cleaned
the
building
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
was
hydrocarbon
or
some
kind
of
flammable
liquid.
it
did
smell
gasoline
in
the
building,
those
seem
to
be
the
only
facts
which
indicated
that
the
fire
was
arson.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
believe
it
is
just
the
fire
and
or
the
police
officials
had
keys
to
the
building,
at
that
time
the
respondent
tyler
had
returned
from
out
of
state
and
i
believe
january
29th,
that
is
when
he
visited
the
premises
and
i
do
not
--
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
he
had
a
key
to
it.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
there
is
nothing
that
i
was
able
to
find.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
have
it
in
the
briefs
--
no
we
do
not,
your
honor,
we
would
of
course
concede
that
if
there
had
been
any
fire
in
a
home
and
the
people
are
still
living
there
or
the
damage
was
not
extensive
that
yes
a
warrant
should
be
obtained
there.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
contend
that
they
construe
it
only
to
meet
what
they
believe
to
be
the
requirements
of
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
but
they
are
doing
it
only
to
do
what
they
believe
what
is
necessary
to
conform
the
federal
constitution
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
contend
that
construing
a
statute
to
make
it
meet
constitutional
requirements
is
itself
a
federal
question
not
a
state
question,
if
their
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment's
requirements
is
mistaken
then
they
would
presumably
they
would
revise
their
judgment
of
what
michigan
(inaudible).
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case
with
case
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no
we
could
not
your
honor
they
would
have
bound
by
that,
of
course
that
would
be
a
state
law,
because
of
it
is
a
legislative
act
rather
than
a
court's
decision
or
court
judgment
that
could
be
reviewed.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
are
asking
this
court
to
if
it
agrees
with
our
position
state
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
require
this
construction.
it
does
not
require
a
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
no
we
would
not
be
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
it
is.
our
contention
is
that
there
will
be
no
protection
afforded
by
the
administrative
warrant
because
it
should
issue
simply
on
the
fact
of
fire
occurring,
there
seems
to
be
no
need
for
any
exercise
of
independent
judgment,
no
real
individual
review
by
a
magistrate.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
if
the
only
question
is
did
a
fire
occur.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
believe
the
administrative
warrant
requirement
which
the
court
below
imposed
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
crime
had
occurred.
it
had
simply
to
do
with
whether
a
fire
had
occurred
and
the
officials
need
to
reenter
the
premises.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
think
camara
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
can
have
inspections
without
showing
necessarily
a
crime
has
occurred.
you
have
to
show
their
reasonableness
by
criteria
which
really
do
not
apply
to
a
post
disaster
investigation.
the
length
of
time
since
a
final
last
inspection
has
occurred
is
irrelevant,
the
only
think
that
is
relevant
is
the
condition
of
the
building.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
are
contending
that
they
do
not
require
an
administrative
search
warrant
even
though--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
we
contend
we
have
a
some
kind
of
mixture
of
both
your
honor.
but
to
the
extent
--.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
you
still
want
to
find,
confirm
the
cause
of
the
fire.
it
was
done
in
a
very
hasty
manner
in
this
case
if
it
is
contended
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
now,
speaking
of
them,
leaving
at
4
a.m.
and
being
satisfied,
that
they
have
determined
the
cause
of
the
fire
simply
by
finding
two
bottles
of
gasoline
or
nearly
that
does
not
seem
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
seems
the
reason
they
left
was
simply
because
there
was
no
more
they
could
do
until
day
light,
until
smoke
and
steam
had
dissipated
and
they
were
able
to
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
there
were
four
hours
and
that
is
the
rough
time
that
even
an
administrative
want
which
requires
really
no
exercise
of
judgment
would
take
so
administrative
warrant
perhaps
could
have
been
obtained
had
there
been
the
requirement
at
the
time
of
the
search.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
sir,
i
believe
they
would
have
gone
back
to
continue
their
investigation
in
daylight
hours
to
do
whatever
they
could
not
do
at
night
while
the
building
was
filled
with
smoke
and
steam.
in
addition
they
need
to
just
check
the
structure
or
integrity
of
any
of
the
building
even
before
letting
the
occupants
back
in.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
it
is
your
honor.
determine
the
cause
of
the
fire,
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
damage
and
to
check
the
structure
or
integrity
of
the
building.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
is
correct
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
for
the
questions,
if
the
court
please,
as
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
number
of
questions
were
asked
about
what
an
administrative
search
warrant
is
in
michigan
and
there
it
is
clear
that
an
administrative
search
warrant
is
issued
by
a
judge,
it
is
just
issued
for
a
different
purpose
for
an
administrative
search
rather
than
for
a
criminal
investigation
and
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
there
is
a
varying
standard
of
probable
cause
under
command.
that
is
the
lower
court's
understanding
and
that
is
the
practice
in
michigan.
there
is
no
one
else
to
issue
an
administrative
search
warrant
but
a
judge.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor,
so
far.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
on
february
16th,
the
premises
were
sitting
in
exactly
the
condition
they
had
been
sitting
in
ever
since
the
fire.
as
far
as
we
know
respondent
tyler
had
been
back
there
only
once.
at
least
until
his
return,
it
is
i
think
the
fire
and
police
officials
were
responsible
more
as
custodians
or
caretakers
for
the
building.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
respondent
tyler
on
february
16th.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
tyler
did
not
own
the
building,
he
leased
it.
he
had
absolutely
nothing
of
value
left
in
there.
the
evidence
in
the
case--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
that
is
we
believe
the
records
in
the
case,
they
did
not
pay
as
rent
according
to
the
landlord,
he
did
not
pay
it.
there
is
one
reference
and
i
do
not
have
the
site
to
the
record
because
i
did
not
know
it
would
be
regarded
as
important
that
he
may
have
paid
and
the
check
did
not
clear
the
bank
or
something
for
that
effect.
but
the
cinder
block
shell
of
the
building
was
intact.
the
inside
was
the
exception
of
the
north
east
and
north
west
corners
were
totally
destroyed
and
there
was
--
as
best
we
could
tell,
nothing
of
value.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
there
is
case
from
the
1920s
which
held
merely
the
obvious
that
the
fireman
who
went
in
were
allowed
to
seize
whatever
they
could
find
while
they
were
putting
out
the
the
fire.
since
that
time
and
before
this
case,
there
were
four
court
of
appeal's
cases.
three
of
them
upheld
the
warrant
was
searched
for
the
cause
or
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
validity
of
a
warrant
was
search
for
the
cause
or
the
origin
of
the
fire.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
pardon
me.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
did
not
require
a
warrant.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
fourth
case
was
written,
at
least
was
joined
in
by
one
of
the
justices
who
wrote
the
opinion
that
is
under
review
now
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
held
that
an
administrative
search
warrant
was
required.
that
holding
was
expressly
rejected
by
two
later
panels
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
never
joined
in
by
anyone
other
than
one
panel.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
65.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
they
are
elected
from
territorial
districts.
there
jurisdiction
then
it
is
a
mixture
of
statewide.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
not
at
all.
we
do
have
conflicts
that
arise
but
they
simply
apply
it
to
the
statewide.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
they
cannot
really
--
they
do
not
really
overrule
--
mr.
jeffrey
butler
two
panels
expressly
considered
it,
found
it
not
persuasive
and
refuse
to
follow
it.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
they
did
your
honor.
this
was
a
pre
denowitz
fire
in
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor
this
fire
occurred
1970
in
the
trial
court
in
1971.
so
this
search
occurred
prior
to
denowitz.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
it
is
not
the
most
recent,
following
denowitz
is
a
case
called
people
against
kulick
and
also
this
decision
people
against
tyler
would
be
wrote
in.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
i
am
not
sure
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
okay.
justice
who
is
now
justice
even
was
a
judge
in
that
panel.
i
do
not
believe
he
wrote
that.
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
question
is,
does
that
mean
that
if
they
continue
a
search
while
there
are
exigent
circumstances
the
exigent
circumstances
dissipate
and
they
continue
the
search
maybe
that
would
have
been
upheld.
whether
denowitz
would
have
allowed
it
a
re-entry
to
be
dealt?
mr.
jeffrey
butler
the
fourth
amendment
primarily
one
or
two
of
them
does
mention
--
the
state
cases
frequently
do
that.
this
case
raises
a
question
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
us
constitution
as
well
as
article
one
section
over
the
state
constitution
and
then
proceed
to
discuss
nothing
but
federal
cases.
it
is
a
frequent
happening
in
state
appellate
court.
thank
you.
