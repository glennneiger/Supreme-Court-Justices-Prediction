ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
november
of
1972
sonja
lynn
bergwho
was
approximately
five
months
pregnant
was
the
sole
support
of
her
family.
she
was
if
you
will
the
bread
winner,
her
husband
was
a
full-time
student
of
the
ministry
and
she
was
the
sole
source
of
income
for
him,
herself
and
her
soon
to
be
born
first
child.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well
it
makes
a
difference
here
mr.
chief
justice
because
of
the
nature
of
the
injury.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
makes
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
injury,
that
would
have
been
incurred
by
mrs.
berg
had
she
been
compelled
to
leave
at
the
time
when
she
was
fully
able
to
work
for
the
richmond
school
district
and
teach
her
kindergartners.
the
nature
of
her
injury
was
such
that
the
district
court
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out
issued
a
preliminarily
injunction
solely
on
the
basis
of
its
jurisdiction
over
her
1983
claim
of
an
invasion
of
her
constitutional
rights
by
virtue
of
the
force
to
leave
policy.
mrs.
berg
in
november
1972
was
indeed
a
person
claiming
to
be
aggrieved
under
title
vii
for
purposes
of
filling
her
charge
for
the
following
reasons.
it
was
her
doctor's
very
best
prediction
and
in
the
area
of
pregnancy
we
deal
with
predictions,
that
she
would
be
able
to
teach
until
the
onset
of
delivery
that
is
to
say
and
tell
the
time
when
the
doctor
believed
she
would
be
confined
for
purposes
of
giving
birth,
for
that
reason
her
doctor
recommended
in
a
letter
to
a
school
district
that
her
state
of
health
was
such
that
she
be
permitted
to
continue
to
teach.
unlike
my
opposing
counsel
statement
of
the
record
and
i
believe
page
111
of
the
appendix
will
--
excuse
me
page
113
of
the
appendix
will
illustrate
this,
the
policy
of
the
district
was
not
to
permit
teachers
as
of
november
of
1972
to
teach
through
their
seventh
month,
but
only
through
there
sixth.
that
there
is
little
importance
to
the
question
of
whether
the
leave
was
a
compulsory
one,
but
in
terms
of
an
individual
whose
income
and
whose
family's
livelihood
depends
upon
that
person's
being
able
to
continue
working
and
where
that
person's
doctor's
advice
is
that,
that
person
is
capable
of
doing
so,
one
month
or
one
week
or
even
one
day's
loss
of
employment
is
actionable
and
a
matter
of
concern
under
title
vii.
the
statement
of
opposing
counsel
was
that
the
leave
would
begin
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
month
and
i
share
council's
confusion
about
the
various
policies
of
this
district,
with
respect
to
leave
dates,
for
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
the
original
policy
on
which
mrs.
berg
filed
her
charge
which
appears
at
page
109
of
the
appendix
was
a
policy
that
would
have
required
her,
not
to
work
during
a
period
of
three
months
when
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
doing
so,
reality
has
demonstrated
that
fact
to
us.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
record
is
not
confused
on
the
points
as
to
which
this
court
has
the
ability
to
make
determinations
of
law,
i
merely
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
richmond
unified
school
district
changed
its
so
called
compulsory
leave
policy
twice
in
the
course
of
this
litigation,
but
retained
the
compulsion
in
that
policy
and
as
the
district
court
observed
the
compulsory
nature
of
the
policy
with
its
assumption
of
the
inability
of
the
individual
to
work
and
its
coercive
element
that,
that
individual's
doctor's
judgment
was
to
be
distrusted
and
with
the
effect
on
the
individual
of
a
deprivation
of
income
was
regardless
of
when
the
compulsion
applied.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
am
sure
that
my
opponent
disagrees
with
me
with
respect
to
the
characterization
of
the
policy
as
compulsory.
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
richmond
school
district
that
this
is
an
individual
policy.
let
me
address
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
this
case
there
is
a
local
rule
which
requires
a
party
making
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
reside
undisputed
facts
and
i
believe
its
page
is
101
and
102
of
our
appendix,
those
facts
which
we
believed
to
be
undisputed
and
to
be
necessary
to
the
district
court's
determination
of
the
illegality
of
this
policy
are
set
forth.
i
wish
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
submissions
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
which
i
believe
appear
at
yes
pages
105
through
107.
do
not
dispute
the
following
facts
which
are
critical
to
the
understanding
of
the
discriminatory
nature
of
this
policy,
first,
that
disabilities
arising
from
pregnancy
are
the
only
disabilities
excluded
from
the
payment
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay,
that
is
second,
no
other
class
of
persons
who
can
be
predicted
to
be
disabled
are
subjected
to
a
classificatory
doubt
of
their
doctor's
advise
and
assumption
and
i
would
say
presumption
will
come
to
a
floor,
i
believe
that
those
individuals
in
their
ninth
month
are
incompetent,
incapable
of
teaching,
awkward,
incapable
indeed
in
the
words
of
dr.
seebott
(ph)
of
even
controlling
their
urinary
functions,
that
in
short
these
pregnant
women
in
there
ninth
month,
all
of
them
,
mind
you,
can
be
excluded
from
employment
by
the
district.
now
in
short
the
basic
facts
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
discriminatory
purpose
an
effect
of
the
richmond
school
district's
policies
taken
as
a
whole
are
not
in
dispute
before
this
court
nor
i
believe
in
terms
of
this
court's
determinations
in
general
electric
company
versus
gilbert
are
the
legal
implications
of
this
designedly
discriminatory
policy,
a
matter
of
legitimate
dispute,
let
me
explain.
first
of
all
we
submit
that
mrs.
berg
in
light
of
her
doctor's
advise,
her
bread
winner
status,
her
ability
to
continue
teaching
and
her
understanding
of
the
richmond
school
district's
policies
as
demonstrated
in
her
charge
are
illustrative
of
rational
conduct
on
the
part
of
an
employee
capable
of
working,
who
is
subject
to
a
mandatory
leave
policy.
she
faced
the
policy
which
at
the
time
she
filed
her
charge
presumed
her
incapable
in
her
seventh,
eighth
and
ninth
month
and
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
stage
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
richmond
school
district
would
have
done
the
following
things
to
her
with
respect
to
the
district
court's
determination
on
the
injunction,
if
it
were
not
enjoined.
first,
despite
her
own
doctor's
advise
she
would
be
compelled
to
see
a
district
physician,
second,
the
district
physician
whose
opinion
has
been
presented
to
this
court
at
page
56
had
his
mind
made
up
with
respect
to
all
of
these
cases,
all
teachers
in
there
ninth
month.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
we
believe
that
the
1976
statute
would,
would
not
for
the
adversariness
between
these
parties
by
the
definition
of
this
court
in
the
opinion
in
kremens
versus
bartley
would
move
the
case
however,
our
understanding
of
the
requirements
with
respect
to
sufficient
adversariness
is
this,
the
parties
here
have
a
genuine
dispute
about
the
legality
of
the
combined
policy
of
mandatory
leave
and
denial
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay.
those
policies
must
be
read
together,
because
they
were
built
together
and
they
were
applied
together,
that
genuine
controversy
involving
as
it
does
the
payment
of
accumulated
sick
leave
to
mrs.
berg
and
her
class
makes
the
case
alive
for
this
point.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
believe
that
the
district
court's,
the
final
injunction,
the
final
judgment
is
printed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
appendix
c
and
that
judgment
embodies
the
final
provisions.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
am
sorry,
it
is
appendix
c
page
46.
if
i
make
turn
to
what
i
believe
to
be
the
most
important
and
controlling
question
in
both
this
case
and
the
satty
(ph)
case.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
there
is
a
monetary
dispute
between
the
richmond
school
district
and
all
the
members
of
the
class,
it
consists
in
the
position
of
the
class
members
and
under
the
district
court's
injunction
this
would
be
appealed
that
there
entitled
to
accumulate
a
sick
leave
pay
for
everyday
of
actual
disability
due
to
pregnancy.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
correct,
she
is
included
amongst
those
who
are
in
need
of
that
relief
and
who
have
afforded
it
below.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
wish
to
turn
to
your
question
asked
this
morning
because
i
believe
it
has
not
yet
been
answered.
how
are
these
policies
discriminatory
against
women
on
account
of
sex?
in
the
case
of
the
richmond
unified
school
district
the
question
is
fairly
easy
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
a
record
made
indeed
before
the
gilbert
case
was
decided.
first
of
all,
the
richmond
unified
school
district
with
respect
to
pregnant
teachers
and
no
other
group,
presumes
them
incapable
of
working
in
their
ninth
month
on
trustworthy
in
terms
of
their
doctor's
advise,
if
their
doctors
say
they
may
work
in
there
ninth
month
and
in
short
that
policy
with
respect
to
forced
leave
question's
the
judgment
of
these
teachers,
these
women
teachers.
i
think
the
nea
the,
national
education
association
amicus
brief
which
characterizes
that
particular
presumption
as
insulting,
puts
the
matter
mildly,
we
have
something
more
here
than
an
insult
to
a
group
of
people.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
am
sure
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
that
like
any
other
health
condition,
doctors
do
tend
to
vary
in
their
prescriptions.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
is
discriminatory
because
no
other
class
of
persons
who
can
contemplate
disability
or
who
are
disabled
then
have
recurring
conditions
are
subjected
to
that
untrusting
interventions
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
school
district.
additionally
here,
we
have
factor
that
suggests
the
richmond's
school
district's
policy
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
subterfuge
that
this
court
defined
as
an
actionable
form
of
conduct
in
gilbert,
namely.
this
school
district
maintained
that
for
purposes
of
leave,
these
teachers
are
presumptively
disabled,
then
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
affidavit
of
the
physician
at
pages
54
through
6
of
the
record
in
support
of
that
and
simultaneously
maintain,
that
these
same
teachers
who
are
disabled,
who
are
awkward,
who
are
unable
walk
around,
who
are
unable
to
teach
their
students
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
their
accumulated
sick
leave
pay.
i
wish
to
turn
to
to
the
very
critical
distinctions
between
the
denial
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
in
this
case
and
the
denial
of
disability
insurance
in
the
general
electric
case.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well
they
cannot
do
it
anymore,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
in
interim
there
are
group
of
women
asked
to
whom
they
have
done
it,
as
to
whom
they
have
denied
that
compensation.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well,
the
court
enjoined
them
from
denying
these
individuals
of
their
accumulated
sick
leave
pay,
but
that
pay.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
you
are
quite
correct
that
the
only
relief
in
form
is
an
injunction.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes,
which
has
been
unpaid,
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
thank
you.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
there
is
money
mr.
justice
marshall
tied
up
--.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
all
right,
the
enjoined
them
from
depriving
the
plaintiff
of
her
accumulated
sick
leave
pay,
she
nonetheless
has
not
received
that
pay,
neither
has
any
class
member
and
there
is
group
of
people
from
1973
to
1975
who
by
virtue
of
this
district's
denial
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay,
have
not
received
there
money.
i
can
assure
you
that
they
have
not
received
there
money,
even
though
i
cannot
point
out
to
you,
where
in
the
judgment,
the
injunction
treats
that,
because
i
do
not
have
it
in
front
of
me,
that
is
the
reason
why.
let
me
turn
if
i
may
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
is
the
judgment
at
page
46
of
appendix
c
to
the
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
the
whole
thing,
that
is
right
it
is.
with
respect
to
the
critical
distinctions
between
the
deprivation
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
in
this
case
and
the
denial
of
disability
insurance
in
the
gilbert
case.
i
wish
to
call
this
courts
attention
to
another
statute
perhaps
we
have
had
to
many
statutes
already,
but
this
one
turns
out
to
be
quite
important
namely,
california
education
code
section
13456
which
is
reprehended
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
in
this
court.
the
relevant
section
of
that
statute,
which
we
believe
is
controlling
on
the
question
of
whether
these
petitioners
could
deprive
these
women
of
their
accumulated
sick
pay,
reads
as
follows.
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
so
as
to
deprive
any
employee
of
sick
leave
rights
under
other
sections
of
this
code
for
absences
due
to
illness
or
injury
resulting
from
pregnancy.
in
short
the
state
of
the
state
statute
at
the
time
that
mrs.
berg
would
have
been
entitled
to
her
accumulated
sick
leave
pay,
entitled
her
to
that
sick
leave
pay.
the
richmond
unified
school
district
at
no
point
in
this
litigation
has
presented
any
reason
of
any
substance
constitutional
or
statutory
for
its
deprivation
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
for
pregnancy.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
yes
in
the
second
section
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
they
have
not
been
payed
because
it
--
we
viewed
it
as
a
money
judgment
in
terms
of
the
payment
by
the
district
of
this
money
and
therefore
stayed
in
affect
by
the
appeals.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
was
stayed,
that
is
correct.
now,
basically
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
this
district
asserts,
that
for
the
purposes
of
statutorily
accumulated
pay
you
earn
10
days
a
year
of
this
for
every
year
you
teach
full
time,
that
they
could
nonetheless
deprive
persons
ill
or
injured
disabled
in
short
due
to
pregnancy
of
that
part
of
their
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
that
they
would
otherwise
be
capable
of
drawing
for
any
other
disability.
let
us
scrutinize
this
condition
and
this
practice
under
the
test
of
general
electric
company
versus
gilbert.
first
of
all
we
have
evidence
in
this
record
and
if
this
court
finds
it
insufficient
to
make
the
point
i
think
were
entitled
to
remand
under
gilbert,
we
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
(inaudible)
purposeful
discrimination,
that
for
purposes
of
compelling
leave,
this
employer
said
you
are
disabled
in
your
ninth
month.
now
we
need
to
look
at
that
compulsory
leave
provision
in
terms
of
the
history
of
school
district's
treatments
of
teachers
generally
and
in
terms
of
this
school
district's
treatment
of
these
teachers.
the
national
education
association
in
an
amicus
brief
to
this
court
in
the
luffler
(ph)
case
detailed
some
200
years
of
discrimination
against
women
in
the
teaching
profession.
first
women
as
a
whole
were
excluded,
then
married
women
and
then
finally
as
in
the
luffler
(ph)
case
women
who
were
pregnant
at
various
stages
of
their
pregnancy.
now
how
about
the
conditions
of
pregnancy
with
respect
to
this
employer,
this
employer
had
a
mandatory
maternity
leave
line
that
contained
in
it
that
entailed
a
presumption
of
disability
at
a
certain
point
and
simultaneously
deprived
every
women
actually
disabled
by
pregnancy,
of
her
accumulated
sick
leave
pay.
we
submit
that
the
statute
which
is
the
only
excuse
if
you
will,
offered
by

conditions.

ms.
mary
c.

the
statutes,
we
believe
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
title
vii
required
it.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
oh!
i
am
sorry.
i
was
speaking
of
the
statute
when
the
california
statute
when
i
said
what
i
said.
that,
that
is
not
only
not
a
justification
for
deprivation
of
the
accumulated
sick
pay
here
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
but
right
that
the
district
was
in
violation
of
that
statute.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
is
a
possibility
i
believe,
it
would
certainly
not
have
resolved
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
is
our
view
that
the
questions
before
this
court
are
the
title
vii
rights
of
the
parties,
it
well
may
have
been
that
an
action
could
have
brought
under
sate
law.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
no,
but
a
district
court
in
a
similar
case
has
construed
this
very
statute
namely
the
oakland
federation
of
teachers
versus
oakland
school
district
case
which
is
sited
in
our
brief
in
which
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
found
that
where
that
district
had
argued
that
this
statute
afforded
them
this
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
basically,
what
it
shows
is
that
this
employer
had
no
bases.
none
of
the
sort
demonstrated
in
ge
and
none
of
any
sort
that
this
is
found
to
be
a
defense
under
title
vii
for
denying
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
additionally.
unlike
the
state
of
california
in
geduldig
versus
aiello
and
unlike
general
electric
company
as
found
by
this
court.
this
school
district
had
no
option
but
to
afford
10
days
of
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
per
year.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
hope
not
to
be
saying
that,
we
have
made
our
prima
facie
showing
in
two
ways
viewing
first
this
court's
language
about
purposeful
discrimination,
we
submit
that
the
tandem
operation
of
the
presumption
of
disability
among
this
pregnant
teachers
with
a
presumption
of
non
disability
with
respect
to
the
accumulated
sick
pay,
shows
the
purpose
to
discriminate
against
these
pregnant
women.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
is
a
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
because
it
is
a
whipsaw
(ph)
i
submit
to
this
court
that
with
general
electrics
mandatory
leave
policy
before
the
court
when
it
decided
that
case
that
it
would
have
decided
as
the
descending
brethren
pointed
out
to
policies
in
tandem
operation,
which
for
one
purpose
drove
women
out
of
employment
at
a
time
that
they
were
able
and
for
another
purpose
deprive
them
of
insurance
benefits
at
a
time
that
they
were
disabled,
that
in
short
this
employer
is
saying
for
purposes
of
whatever
discretion
we
may
over
your
leave.
we
presume
you
are
disabled
and
the
group
is
composed
solely
of
women
who
along
with
their
doctors
are
being
distressed
and
suspected
and
questioned
and
presumed
incompetent
for
purposes
of
their
going
on
working
and
teaching.
at
the
same
time
that
the
school
district
is
saying
when
it
comes
to
accumulated
sick
pay
this
is
the
one
condition
for
which
we
will
not
pay
you.
i
submit
that
the
tandem
operation
of
these
two
policies
makes
a
different
case
than
this
court
decided
in
the
general
electric
situation.
may
i
briefly
review
a
couple
of
other
aspect
with
respect
to
this.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
will
try
to
do
that
in
a
very
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
will
try
to
do
that
in
a
very
brief
time.
i
wish
only
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
richmond
unified
school
district
has
argued
that
the
whole
question
here
is
a
matter
of
contract
at
page
11
of
their
reply
brief
and
that
state
regulations
and
law
is
former
part
of
that
contract
and
i
would
finally
submit
to
the
court
on
the
issue
accumulated
sick
leave
pay
that
by
an
unwritten
policy
that
has
never
been
justified
in
this
litigation.
the
richmond
school
district
deprived
these
women
of
compensation
which
their
own
policy
namely
that
appearing
at
pages
74
and
75
of
the
of
the
appendix
would
have
suggested
these
women
were
entitled
to
in
short,
we
have
here
the
elements
of
a
subterfuge
for
discrimination
that
were
absent
in
the
general
electric
case.
if
this
court
remains
in
doubt
about
my
characterization
and
believes
that
their
issues
is
a
fact
as
to
that
subterfuge,
then
because
we
are
here
in
a
summary
judgment
posture
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
briefly
as
to
jurisdiction
first.
the
petitioners
allege
that
mrs.
berg
charge
is
unsworn,
the
records
simply
forecloses
that
argument
because
at
page
109
she
signs
and
dates
below
the
language,
“i
swear
or
affirm
that
i
have
read
the
above
charge
and
that
it
is
true”
so
forth.
basically
what
we
have
here
is
a
charge
that
is
not
notarized
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
notarization
is
not
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
bringing
of
suit.
the
second
issue
raised
by
these
petitioners
is
whether
she
rushed
to
court
too
quickly.
i
submit
first
that
the
ninth
circuit's
dictum
with
respect
to
the
lower
court's
discretion
to
maintain
the
status
quo
under
title
vii
is
really
of
no
special
concern
to
this
court
because
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
under
1983
is
unquestioned
and
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
imposed
upon
these
petitioners
under
title
vii
rest
upon
a
timely
filed
charge
by
an
aggrieved
individual
on
the
basis
of
which
the
department
of
justice
issued
a
right
to
sue
and
the
judgment
was
entered
long
after
a
180
days
from
the
filing
of
charge.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
correct.
however
this
court's
decision
in
occidental
life
insurance
company
versus
eeoc
indicates
that
the
court's
concern
is
with
private
individuals
who
completely
avoid
or
circumvent
the
stages
of
administrative
proceeding
that
congress
has
prescribed
in
title
vii
and
here
we
would
submit
that
mrs
berg
did
everything
within
her
capabilities
and
within
the
confines
of
the
pregnancy
that
lasted
nine
months.
to
get
this
letter
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
she
filed
a
1983
action
and
a
title
vii
complaint.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
before
the
letter
had
arrived
in
the
mail,
that
is
correct.
the
court
was
informed
of
the
issuance
of
the
letter
on
the
day
it
issued
the
preliminary
injunction.
moreover
in
this
case
mrs
berg
faced,
i
am
sorry
the
district
court
faced
the
following
choice.
once
that
letter
was
issued
some
14
days
after
the
suit
was
filed,
it
could
either
require
dismissal
and
refiling
that
same
day
or
permit
supplementation
of
the
complaint
and
we
believe
that
the
district
court
followed
this
court's
holding
in
love
versus
pullman
steel
--
pullman
train
company
by
saying
i
would
not
require
you
to
go
down
and
pull
that
complaint
out
of
the
drawer,
stamp
it
dismissed
and
then
put
in
the
letter
and
stamp
it
refiled.
i
would
permit
supplementation.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
think
that
no,
mr
justice
marshall,
but
i
think
that
is
really
not
an
appropriate
characterization
of
what
occurred
here.
i
think
that
rather
what
occurred
here
was
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
she
had
to
file
suit
right
that
day.
well,
let
us
see
she
could
have
--
yes
she
could
have
filed
suit
two
weeks
later
and
if
she
had
filed
a
suit
two
weeks
later,
she
might
still
have
been
able
to
give
the
other
side
ample
notice
and
get
to
court
in
time
to
get
the
injunction
which
was
the
only
means
by
which
this
woman
kept
her
job.
yes
she
could
have,
we
could
have
cut
it
a
little
finer.
but
basically
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
here
that
she
filed
her
charge
too
soon.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
do
not
believe
there
was
disregard
of
the
statute
and
i
believe
that
a
reading
of
the
statute
will
provide
that
the
department
of
justice's
letter
is
valid
if
issued
within
a
180
days
or
after
dismissal
of
the
charge,
it
does
say
whichever
is
later.
the
department
of
justice
in
this
case
recites
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
seems
to
me
that
a
notice
of
right
of
action
if
issued
on
the
day
of
final
judgment,
that
would
be
a
very
unusual
case
it
seems
to
me
because
how
would
the
district
court
have
determined
it
had
jurisdiction
and
in
the
earlier
stage
the
district
court
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
do
not
resist
that,
i
simply
would
suggest
that
the
district
court
had
no
opportunity
to
dismiss
this
action
before
the
time
that
the
right
to
sue
letter
was
issued.
when
could
it
have
dismissed
the
action.
it
was
filed
on
the
5th,
a
preliminary
injunction
was
granted
on
the
22nd,
a
right
to
sue
letter
was
issued
on
the
21st
the
day
before
the
court
was
notified
of
that
fact
and
the
district
court
as
of
the
time
the
right
to
sue
letter
was
issued
had
that
choice
should
it
require
dismissal
and
refilling
or
should
it
permit
supplementation.
i
submit
therefore
that
in
this
case
which
is
somewhat
unusual
in
it's
facts.
the
district
court
at
the
time
that
it
determined
to
allow
supplementation
had
before
it
both
of
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites,
the
filling
of
a
timely
charge,
the
issuance
of
a
proper
invalid
notice
of
right
of
action
from
the
department
of
justice.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
we
are
in
a
difficult
posture
here
arguing
what
might
have
been
the
case
if
the
district
court
had
not
had
1983
jurisdiction
to
do
precisely
what
it
did
and
as
this
court
itself
pointed
out
although
it
cut
in
a
different
direction,
the
equal
protection
concerns
here
and
the
title
vii
concerns
here
are
not
so
far
apart.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
do
not
request
the
blanket
approval,
i
simply
seek
--
oh
i
am
sorry
i
meant
to
be
much
clear
with
you
about
that.
i
do
not
think
any
blanket
approval
is
necessary
in
this
case
because
i
do
not
think
the
issues
that
you
suggest
are
necessarily
to
be
determined
in
this
case.
i
think
they
need
not
be
reached
by
this
court.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
were
it
truly
moot,
i
do
not
mean
to
fight
your
facts,
were
it
truly
mooted.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
and
no
issues
of
relief
and
everyone
has
being
paid.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
you
make
it
a
harder
question
if
the
only
issues
is
attorney's
fees.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well
the
only
thing
remaining
is
attorney's
fees.
i
believe
there
is
a
federal
appellate
level
decision
holding
that
even
where
the
only
issue
is
attorney's
fees,
the
action
is
not
moot,
i
would
have
to
do
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
the
action
is
not
moot,
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well
the
rest
of
the
judgment
would
technically
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
it
may
sound
surprising
but
i
believe
i
read
in
an
opinion
to
that
effect.
i
think
that
is
not
this
case,
without
fighting
your
facts
because
we
have
here
significant
question
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
that
is
perfectly
possible
and
in
that
event
we
would
--
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
highly
unlikely,
but
perfectly
possible.
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
need
for
briefing
on
the
question
of
mootness
we
stand
ready
to
do
anything
this
court
wishes
in
that
regard.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
think
that
is
quite
correct.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
believe
it
does
not.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
i
hear
you
very
quickly,
attorney's
fees
are
a
form
of
relief
specifically
prescribed
under
title
vii
that
would
require
certain
legal
determinations
as
mr
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out.
ms.
mary
c.
dunlap
well
there
are
still
money
involved
here,
i
assure
you.
you
and
i
agree
on
that
certainly.
thank
you
very
much.[laughter]
