mr.
walenta,
you
are
prejudiced,
how?
unknown
speaker
the
letter
does
not
bare
on
prejudice,
of
course
does
it?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
the
latter
does
not
bare
on
your
prejudice
and
that
--
unknown
speaker
luce,
l-u-c-e?
unknown
speaker
g-l-u-s.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
the
citation?
unknown
speaker
third
circuit.
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
case
that
you
are
talking
about
--
school
boards
and
public
agencies.
unknown
speaker
what
you
said
that
was
just
a
city.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
public
agency
or
a
--
unknown
speaker
what
about
school
board?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
you
knew
the
answer
to
the
case
that
was
being
argued
next
week.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we
know
the
1983
would
be
segregation
suit
in
moot
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
what
if
kenosha
city
is
a
public
agency?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
pay
claim?
unknown
speaker
for
the
past?
unknown
speaker
so
that
issue
is
here,
but
it
certainly
does
not
involve
that
claim
does
not
involve
forced
leave
issue.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
dealt
at
all
ms.
dunlap
and
whether
you
are
not
do,
it
is
of
course
up
to
you,
with
the
jurisdictional
issues
raised
by
your
brother.
unknown
speaker
because
they
are
covered
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
you
would
concede
that
it
is
the
structure
of
the
act
that
a
person
can
not
bring
out
prior
title
vii
action
until
he
or
she
gets
a
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
commissioner
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
appears
to
be
and
this
court
has
so
understood
it
and
is
publicly
said
so
in
at
least
two
opinions,
has
not
it?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think,
do
you
think
the
possibility
of
a
petitioner
having
his
cost
paid
saves
the
case
from
being
moot?
you
know
it
does
not?
unknown
speaker
you
know
it
does
not
and
yet
â€“
case
is
moot
out
after
it
has
been
filed
here.
we
strip
it
down
on
the
poor
petitioner
is
left
with
his
cause.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
issue
of
enforced
leave?
is
that
moot
or
not?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
we
would
agree
with
you
on
the
sick
leave
pay.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
save
the
other
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if,
what
would
have
--
you
paid
the
cost
in
the
lower
court,
i
get
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
you
lost
below.
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
there
were
costs
there
you
paid
them.
unknown
speaker
assume
we
did
what
we
usually
do
and
when
a
case
is
moot
and
vacated
the
judgments
below.
what
happens
to
the
cost?
you
are
just
left
where
you
were.
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
how
about
your
cost?
