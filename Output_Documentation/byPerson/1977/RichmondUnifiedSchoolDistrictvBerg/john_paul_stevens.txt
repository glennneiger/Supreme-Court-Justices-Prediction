justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
walenta
could
i
ask
you,
do
you
concede
the
presence
of
any
paid
paternity
leave?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
concede
the
presence
of
even
one
day's
payment
for
to
a
father
for
paternity
leave.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
do
you
concede
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms
dunlap
before
you
do,
let
me
just
get
one
thing
clear,
is
there
no
dispute
over
back
pay
or
any
monetary
dispute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
the
named
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
dunlap,
let
me
test
that
for
a
moment.
you
argue
that
very
forcefully
in
you
brief.
do
you
think
that
there
is
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion
between
doctors
as
to
the
precise
time
when
a
pregnant
person
should
discontinue
teaching
a
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
why
is
it
irrational
for
the
school
board
to
say
it
would
like
have
its
own
doctor
form
a
judgment
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
you
would
have
had
a
suit
as
a
matter
of
state
law
you
could
have
brought
this
action
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
not
more
than
a
possibility,
should
we
get
involved
in
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
either
of
the
lower
courts
construe
the
californian
statue
which
you
are
now
directing
our
attention
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
argument
if
i
get
it
correctly
is
another
distinction
of
the
general
electric
case
is
that
here
you
are
entitled
as
a
matter
of
the
state
law
to
be
paid
and
in
defiance
of
state
law
you
were
not
paid
therefore
that
shows
that
it
is
--
what
does
it
show
--
what
follows
from
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
dunlap
the
question
and
i
asked
this
earlier
today
and
you
are
going
to
answer
is,
how
have
you
made
out
a
prima
facie
case?
and
everybody
seems
to
say
that,
well
they
have
not
made
out
an
affirmative
defense
and
you
seemed
to
be
saying
the
same
thing.
how
you
made
out
your
prima
facie
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
say
it
is
the
kind
of
disability
that
makes
it
inappropriate
for
you
to
teach,
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
disability
for
which
we
are
going
to
allow
sick
leave.
why
is
that
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
if
you
accept
the
basic
reasoning
of
general
electric.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr
wallenta
do
you
concede
that
there
is
still
is
remaining
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
lady
should
receive
some
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
case
can
not
possibly
be
mooted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
wallenta
aren't
the
cost
that
you
are
discussing
may
cost
abstain
these
people
from
working
and
you
have
got
services
in
exchange
for
that
money.
