white
or
even
if
they
were,
it
still
would
not
have
adopted
that
the
law
and
its
new
policies.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
you
mean
to
repeal
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
is
any
issue
about
the
force
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
issue
is
it
--
what
issue
do
you
think
is
open
here
after
this
change
in
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
in
that
respect
as
like
the
case
we
just
heard,
just
--
i
mean
the
prior
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
give
you
another
suppose
to
be
case.
you
have
a
judgment
and
a
word
of
attorney
fees.
let
us
just
suppose
that
in
every
respect,
this
case
is
moot
on
the
merits
and
then
everybody
agrees
that
it
is
just
moot
that
the
state
law
has
given
you
every
piece
of
relief
on
the
merits
that
you
could
want.
what
should
we
do
with
respect
to
--
normally
if
the
case
is
moot
we
vacate
in
a
federal
court,
it
is
a
federal
court
that
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
order
its
dismissal,
that
is
it
dismissed
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
i
just
assume
that
it
is
truly
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
except
for
attorney's
fees,
the
attorney's
fees
there
you
have
been
awarded
attorney's
fees,
but
it
now
happens
that
every
other
part
of
the
judgment
is
moot.
the
case
is
just
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you.
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
bare
on
this
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
rest
of
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
saves
the
attorney's
fees,
as
you
say
is
all
the
other
issues
were
being
moot,
that
we
must
decide
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what
is
your
position
is,
we
may
not
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
highly
unlikely,
i
suppose
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
have
lost
but
if
we
vacated
the
judgments,
those
judgements
are
not
authoritative
anymore
with
respect
to
your
losing,
but
nevertheless
you
are
stuck
with
your
cost.
i
take
it.
