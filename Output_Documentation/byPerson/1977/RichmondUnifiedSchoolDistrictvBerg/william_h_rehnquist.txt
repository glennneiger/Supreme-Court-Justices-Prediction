justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
there
cases
from
at
least
other
jurisdictions
holding
that
they
admitted
claim
for
the
attorney's
fees,
if
it
is
less
than
or
by
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
keep
the
case
from
being
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
in
this
confused
state
of
the
record,
if
you
want
a
summary
judgment
and
disputed
affidavits
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
agreed
on
by
everybody,
by
your
opponent
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
how
does
the
district
court
on
your
motion
for
summary
judgment
decide
a
question
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
your
line
of
reason
and
i
suppose
you
would
concede
if
the
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
required
bond
on
the
5th
and
that
the
right
to
sue
letter
had
not
arrived
till
the
21st
perhaps
damages
could
be
recovered
on
that
bond,
but
the
district
court,
really
took
no
action
on
that
complaint
until
after
all
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites
were
present.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
like
to
have
one
more
question.
if
attorney's
fees
are
saved
from
--
i
take
that
the
rest
of
case
has
got
to
be
saved
too
because
the
court
is
got
to
examine
into
the
question
of
whether
it
was
properly
decided
that
the
prevailing
party
received
the
attorney's
fees.
