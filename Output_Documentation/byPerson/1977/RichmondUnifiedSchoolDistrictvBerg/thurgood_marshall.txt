on
the

and

justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
has
any
effect
on
the
case
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
why
it
was
changed,
i
am
talking
about
what
it
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
1976.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
this
statute
that
have
been
in
effect,
when
this
case
was
decided
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
have
any
effect
on
your
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
have
any
effect
on
your
case
or
whether
we
should
decide
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
basis
for
this
are
you
going
to
give
me
some
legislature
history
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
in
here,
is
it
in
the
record
of
brief
or
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
will
i
find
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
any
of
these
things
here,
any
of
these
brief
or
records
or
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
me
to
go
out
and
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
the
general
rule
was
more
than
$10,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
this
other
statute
the
1976
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
page
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
76th
statute
says
that
you
cannot
do
that
anymore.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
get
damages
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
the
only
relief
was
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
in
the;
all
of
this
does
it
say
anything
about
money,
it
says
an
injunction
and
counsel
fees,
that
is
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
where
is
it
the
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
injunction
is
what
you
pointed
out
to
me
in
the
appendix
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
the
whole
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
mean
to
say
is
that
the
court
means
a
word
that
you
stop
withholding
payment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
assume,
you
do
not
want
us
to
say
as
a
matter
of
precedent
that
anyone
who
wants
to
disregard
the
statute
may
file
providing
they
file
the
notice
letter
14
days
later.
you
do
not
want
us
to
say
that
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
have
to
file
it
right
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
presumption
is
that
there
has
been
disregard
of
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
mentioned
anytime
up
until
the
day
of
final
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
not
see,
why
you
would
be
satisfied
in
saying
that
in
this
case
specialize
the
facts
are,
it
is
possible
to
do
it
this
way
rather
than
to
be
asking
us
to
make
blanket
approval
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
want
money,
there
was
money
involved.
they
went
(inaudible)
should
pay
any
help
of
temporary
disability
insurance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not
he
want
himself
saying
that
you
were
enjoined
from
not
paying
the
sick
leave
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
does
that
mean
when
we
enjoin
from
not
paying,
it
means
you
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
members
of
the
class.
