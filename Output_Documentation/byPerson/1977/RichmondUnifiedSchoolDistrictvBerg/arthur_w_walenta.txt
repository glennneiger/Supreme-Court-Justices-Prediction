mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
it
court.
this
is
a
civil
rights
action
brought
by
mrs.
berg
a
teacher
employed
by
richmond
unified
school
district.
it
was
brought
to
prevent
the
district
from
placing
her
on
maternity
leave
and
to
compel
the
district
to
allow
her
sick
leave
credit,
while
absent
due
to
maternity.
mrs.
berg
was
granted
a
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
because
this
case
was
decided
as
a
summary
judgment
and
because
there
is
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
the
import
of
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
district
court,
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
what
the
evidence
was.
the
evidence
consisted
of
pleadings
in
the
case,
mrs.
berg's
complaint,
an
amendment
to
it,
a
supplement
to
it,
the
answer
filed
by
school
district,
limited
affidavits
and
exhibits
presented
by
mrs.
berg
and
somewhat
more
extensive
affidavits
and
exhibits
provided
by
the
school
district
and
that
is
all
the
evidence
there
was.
that
evidence
shows
that
before
december
1972,
the
school
district
maintained
a
compulsory
maternity
leave
regulation
requiring
teachers
to
terminate
their
service
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
month
of
pregnancy
and
to
take
maternity
leave
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
district
had
an
informal
policy
disallowing
sick
leave
usage
for
maternity
purposes.
in
november
of
1972,
mrs.
berg
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
challenging
these
policies,
this
charge
was
unsworn,
this
charge
contained
the
notation
that
she
had,
had
no
correspondence
with
the
school
district.
on
december
13th
of
1972,
the
school
district
governing
board
modified
its
maternity
leave
policy
to
permit
individual
consideration
of
request
of
teachers
to
work
later
than
the
seventh
month.
the
next
day,
mrs.
berg
applied
for
maternity
leave
in
an
application
that
conformed
to
the
policy
as
it
had
been
modified
the
preceding
day.
on
december
20,
mrs.
berg
submitted
a
second
application
for
maternity
leave
and
in
that
application,
she
asked
permission
to
continue
work
until
term,
until
her
child
was
born.
seven
days
later
the
school
district
replied
in
a
letter
to
mrs.
berg,
stating
that
if
she
was
going
to
work
until
that
date,
the
district
wanted
a
physical
examination
by
its
doctor
to
be
assured
of
her
physical
condition.
there
was
intervening
correspondence
from
mrs.
berg's
attorney
and
she
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
on
february
5th.
on
february
16th
taking
into
account
medical
advice
that
the
district
had
obtained
in
the
intervening
period,
the
district
superintendent
promogated
a
more
elaborated
policy
for
maternity
leave
and
mrs.
berg
was
notified
that
this
revised
policy
would
be
applied
in
her
case.
in
chronological
order
on
the
21st
of
february,
mrs.
berg
received
the
notice
of
her
right
to
sue
under
title
vii
and
on
the
22nd
she
received
a
preliminary
injunction
from
the
federal
district
judge.
in
march
on
the
14th
she
had
her
child
and
she
worked
up
until
that
time
and
in
june
she
supplemented
her
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
action
to
allege
her
receipt
of
the
statutory
notice
of
her
right
to
sue
under
title
vii.
from
the
outset,
the
school
district
has
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
it
is
our
contention
in
the
first
place
that
her
eeoc
charge
was
premature
and
that
it
was
not
a
proper
charge
sufficient
to
found
a
federal
district
court
action
under
title
vii.
at
the
time
that
she
filed
this
charge,
the
district
had
taken
no
action
respecting
her.
the
policy
that
she
complained
of
in
the
charge
was
modified
before
the
district
took
any
action
concerning
her
and
it
was
not
until
the
27th
of
december
when
a
letter
was
written
by
the
district
to
mrs.
berg
that
there
was
the
first
occasion
or
occurrence
as
i
would
call
it,
between
the
district
and
the
aggrieved
person
that
i
think
she
could
complain
about
and
that
was
the
point
which
the
district
indicated
that
it
wanted
a
medical
examination
by
its
physician.
when
we
look
to
the
specific
language
of
the
statute,
i
think
we
find
that
congress
intended
under
that
statute
that
an
unlawful
practice
have
occurred
before
you
can
file
a
charge.
the
time
periods
that
are
involved
in
the
statute
occur
“after
the
alleged,
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.”
the
charge
is
to
be
filed
by
a
person
claiming
to
be
grieved
and
that
person
has
to
allege
in
the
charge,
“that
a
lawyer
has
engaged
in
an
unlawful
employment
practice.”
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
we
are
prejudiced
for
one
thing
by
becoming
implicated
in
a
legal
proceeding
based
upon
a
charge
that
was
hypothetical
and
speculative
when
filed
and
in
fact
in
the
situation
in
which
the
facts
changed
between
the
time
the
charge
was
filed
and
the
time
any
action
was
taken
concerning
mrs.
berg.
secondly,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
it
is
congress
that
mandated
that
this
eeoc
charge
be
a
condition
that
a
person
is
required
to
file
before
they
can
file
suit
in
district
court.
they
must
file
suit
a
certain
number
of
days
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
excuse
me
justice.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
no
that
is
correct,
that
is
a
different
issue.
in
any
event
we
find
no
occurrence
between
the
district
and
mrs.
berg
until
six
weeks
after
this
charge
was
filed
we
believe
that
congress
clearly
mandated
that
a
charge
be
filed
and
that
indeed
the
statutory
procedure
for
charges,
for
eeoc
investigation
and
for
the
various
time
periods
that
are
implicated
in
the
statute
cannot
be
followed,
unless
one
requires
that
there
be
a
charge
that
is
definite
to
occurrence
and
that
shows
an
actual
subject
of
actual
grievance,
on
the
part
of
a
complaining
party
before
they
can
file
a
federal
court
suit.
the
further
major
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
mrs.
berg
filing
suit
before
she
received
the
statutory
notice
of
her
right
to
sue
from
the
attorney
general.
this
court
has
characterized
that
notice
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
in
more
than
one
case.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled,
that
by
virtue
of
her
obtaining
the
notice
after
she
filed
a
suit
and
by
virtue
of
her
supplementing
her
complaint,
she
had
cured
a
jurisdictional
defect
that
existed
when
the
suit
was
filed
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
henderson
against
eastern
freight
ways.
we
have
in
our
brief,
elaborated
our
quarrel
with
the
henderson
decision.
henderson
holds
that
a
late
notice
under
title
vii
has
the
effect
of
validating
a
complaint
that
was
untimely
filed.
once
to
sympathize
perhaps
with
the
decision
in
the
henderson
case,
but
we
believe
that
it
is
wrong
in
principle
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
very
serious
issue
indeed
without
ascertaining
when
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
and
we
believe
that
the
proposition
that
jurisdictional
facts
can
occur
to
prefect
jurisdiction
that
did
not
exist
when
the
suit
was
filed,
would
leave
the
courts
with
rather
intolerable
situation.
this
court
in
1824
in
mollan
against
torrence
established
a
rule
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
depends
upon
the
facts
that
the
time
action
is
filed.
this
specific
ruling
was
confirmed
by
an
opinion
written
by
justice
brandeis
and
we
believe
that
is
correct.
it
is
simple,
it
is
intelligible
and
we
believe
that
it
ought
to
be
followed.
i
have
mentioned,
that
in
the
absence
of
following
that
rule,
you
raise
a
situation.
in
which
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
file
federal
district
court
suits
and
establish
jurisdiction
after
the
fact.
in
district
court
cases
following
henderson
and
title
vii.
district
court
jurisdiction
has
been
found
to
be
established
one
year
and
more
after
this
suit
was
filed.
the
idea
of
this
being
the
general
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
is
one
that
i
find,
very
difficult
to
live
with.
finally,
we
contend
that
this
henderson
decision
has
the
practical
effect
of
avoiding
all
of
the
requirements
that
congress
mandated.
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
title
vii
and
the
preliminary
operation
of
an
administrative
procedure
required
to
resolve
complaints
before
matters
get
into
the
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
bring
the
courts
attention
to
a
decision
that
has
been
handed
down
by
the
third
circuit
since
our
reply
brief
was
filed.
that
is
glus
against
gc
murphy
company.
that
is
a
title
vii
case.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
g-l-u-s.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
i
have
filed
or
lodged
i
should
say,
copies
of
that
opinion
with
clerk
of
the
court
for
the
justices.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
its
not
yet
in
print.
you
have
copies
with
the
clerk
and
in
your
law
library.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
third
circuit.
that
case
was
one
in
which
an
employer
were
to
file
a
cross
complaint
in
a
title
vii
case
against
the
union
that
had
not
been
named
in
the
original
eeoc
chart.
and
the
third
circuit
ruled
that
title
vii
jurisdiction
could
not
be
obtained
by
procedural
devices
under
the
federal
rules
and
following
rule
82,
the
glus
case
stands
for
the
position
that
the
federal
rules
cannot
be
used
to
expand
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
importance
for
this
case
is
that
mrs.
berg
supplement
was
filed
under
rule
15(e).
the
other
ground
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
found
jurisdiction
in
this
case
arises
in
the
theory,
that
title
vii
jurisdiction
can
be
perfected
before
the
receipt
of
a
notice
of
right
to
sue.
in
order
to
permit
preliminary
injunctive
relief
and
in
that,
the
ninth
circuit
followed
the
theory
of
drew
against
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
a
fifth
circuit
decision.
if
i
understand
the
drew
case
correctly,
it
holds
or
agrees
in,
i
should
say.
that
before
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii
which
permitted
a
preliminary
suit
by
the
attorney
general.
there
existed
by
implication,
a
private
cause
of
action
to
obtain
preliminary
relief,
without
awaiting
commission
action.
this
cause
of
action
existed,
because
it
was
necessary
to
enforce
the
rights
granted
by
the
statute.
the
court
in
drew
does
not
sight
any
authority
holding
that
to
be
the
case.
they
simply,
apparently
expounded
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
proposition
in
drew,
is
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
section
1343
to
prosecute
a
title
vii
action
before
you
have
obtained
title
vii
jurisdiction.
that
case
has
been
criticized
by
several
district
court
opinions.
we
have
argued
length
in
our
brief
that
its
theory
is
untenable.
we
believe
in
particular
that
the
theory
in
drew
is
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
national
railroad
passengers
corporation
against
passengers
association
and
the
rule
of
that
case
is
that
express
statutory
provisions
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
are
controlling
absent
clear
evidence
of
a
contrary
legislative
intent.
we
have
found
and
mrs.
berg
has
not
found
to
my
knowledge
any
evidence
that
congress
intended
a
broader
private
cause
of
action
in
title
vii
cases,
then
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
statute.
we
believe
that
the
holdings
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
drew
and
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
henderson
conflict
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
occidental
life
against
eeoc
and
alexander
against
gardner-denver
and
in
mcdonnell
douglas
case,
that
the
statutory
preconditions
to
private
suit
under
title
vii
are
jurisdictional
prerequisites.
so,
far
as
the
merits
of
this
case
are
concerned
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes,
it
was
1983
claim
as
well.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes,
that
is
the
statute
pursuant
to
which
the
district
court
purported
the
act.
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1983.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
as
against
superintendent
snowgrass
(ph)
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
against
the
district
and
the
governing
board.
although
at
the
time
that
it
entered
the
preliminary
injunction
this
court
had
not
decided
the
case
which
rule
that
a
public
agency
was
immune
from
general
1983
jurisdiction
for
injunctive
purposes.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
the
course,
the
problem
is
that
ninth
circuit
expressed
the
theory
that
there
was
title
vii
jurisdiction,
notwithstanding
that
the
district
court
didn't
purport
to
act
under
title
vii
at
the
outset
and
you
have
to
reach
that
aspect
of
ninth
circuit
decision.
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
city
of
kenosha
against
bruno.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
no,
city
of
kenosha
against
bruno
was
the
case
in
which
this
court
ruled
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
under
1983
to
grant
equitable
relief
against
a
public
agency
because
the
agency
was
not
a
person.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
the
case
involved
a
city.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
i
would
say
the
lower
courts
have
universally
accepted
that
case
as
being
applicable
to
school
boards.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
since
you
handed
down
city
of
kenosha
against
bruno,
we
do
not
suffer
the
wear
and
tear
that
we
did
prior
to
your
decision
in
that
respect.
if
i
mention
that
case
to
--
in
fact
in
this
case
as
soon
as
that
case
was
mentioned
to
judge
(inaudible)
he
allowed
that
he
was
incorrect
and
at
one
point
this
case
was
dismissed,
as
to
the
school
board
then
re
instituted
after
mrs.
berg
supplemented
her
complaint.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well
kenosha
deals
--
yes
with
the
question
of
who
is
a
person
and
who
is
not.
really
more
seriously
and
it
is
a
fascinating
case,
statutory
immunity
was
abolished
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
1960,
but
before
that
time
direct
suits
against
governmental
agencies
were
practically
unknown
and
they
were
practically
unknown
when
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
and
i
think
that
this
court
was
correct,
when
it
interpreted
the
early
civil
rights
act
as
not
providing
any
implied
cause
of
action
against
public
agencies,
that
is
against
individuals.
that
was
absolutely
consistent
with
the
general
legal
thinking
and
understanding
of
the
error
when
the
statute
was
adopted.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
correct
city
of
kenosha
against
bruno
was
required
because
the
appellate
courts
and
district
courts
could
not
believe
that
monroe
against
pape
extended
to
injunctive
relief.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
as
to
the
merits,
we
contend
that
a
school
district
policy
requiring
medical
information
concerning
a
pregnant
teacher
and
reserving
the
right
to
determine
the
beginning
date
of
maternity
leave
does
not
violate
title
vii
unless
that
policy
is
pretext
for
discrimination
or
results
in
gender
based
discriminatory
effects.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
the
change
in
california
law.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
the
change
in
that
statute
does
not
directly
effect
the
merits
of
this
case
as
to
mrs.
berg.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
direct
the
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
strictly
speaking,
i
think
not
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
we
are
faced
to
course
with
our
obligation
to
mrs.
berg
which
got
to
be
adjudicated.
we
are
faced
with
our
obligation
to
the
class
since
this
was
certified
as
a
class
action
and
we
also
have
a
risk
$5,000
in
attorney's
fees
that
have
been
awarded,
so
the
case
remains
tangible.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
connection
with
the
statutory
change
there
is
a
factual
situation
that
is
not
precedented,
as
far
as,
your
decisions
are
concerned.
the
california
legislature
did
not
change
the
statute
with
a
view
toward
voluntarily
changing
the
law
in
the
state.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well
the
statute
was
changed
to
write
into
california
law
the
eeoc
regulation
that
this
court
criticized
in
gilbert
against
general
electric,
i
agree.
but
that
statute
was
adopted
and
i
read
section
6
of
chapter
915
of
the
california
statutes
of
1976
i
believe,
1975.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes,
had
that
statute
been
adopted
simply
to
change
california
law
and
to
allow
benefits
to
teachers
that
they
would
not
have
otherwise
the
state
would
have
been
required
to
reimburse
the
school
district
for
the
costs
incurred
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
legislature
ruled
that
out
and
they
said
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
if
this
statute
had
been
in
effect
in
december
of
1972,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
i
realize
that
is
what
your
point
is
and
that
is
why
i
want
to
indicate
to
the
court
what
the
california
legislature
thought
they
were
doing
when
adopted
this
statute.
the
statute
says
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record
and
it
is
in
the
section
6
of
chapter
915.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
it's
california
statute
1975.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
this
is
in
the
court's
law
library,
i
would
expect,
this
is--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
no,
i
am
going
read
it
to
you,
the
legislature
said
there
are
no
state
mandated
local
costs
in
this
act
that
require
reimbursement
because
this
act
merely
affirms
for
the
state
that
which
has
been
declared
existing
law
or
regulation
through
action
by
the
federal
government.
in
other
words
the
california
legislature
was
under
a
misapprehension
of
how
this
court
was
going
to
decide
general
electric
case
and
it
is
interesting
that
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
true,
but
we
will
at
least
have
a
claim
to
ask
the
legislature
for
our
money
back
if
this
court
can
rule
in
our
favor
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
not
to
repeal
it,
but
to
appropriate
money
under
the
collateral
law
that
requires
them
to
reimburse
our
costs
when
they
impose
those
costs
as
opposed
to
the
courts
imposing
those
cost.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
all
issue
remain
open
as
to
mrs.
berg.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
correct,
but
the
point
is
if
she
was
entitled
to
the
relief
that
she
received
not
withstanding
that
her
actual
leave
is
moot
(ph),
she
is
entitled
to
a
reward
for
attorney's
fees,
we
have
to
pay
them.
so
that
$5,000
is
at
issue
regardless.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
oh
i
think
it
is.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
well,
that
is
limitation
on
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
under
certain
other
statutes.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
not
a
subject
that
i
have
researched,
cannot
respond
to
it.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
the
pay
claim
exists,
continues
to
exist
both
ways
to
mrs.
berg
and
as
to
the
class
that
is
certified
between
the
period
1973
and
1975.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
true,
that
involves
the
right
to
use
sick
leave.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes
that
is
true.
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
no
we
do
not.
that
issue
was
not
litigated
functionally
until
the
respondent's
brief
is
filed
before
this
court
and
there
are
no
fact
in
the
subject
that
i
know
of
in
the
record.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
there
is
no
showing.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor
and
i
must
frankly
say
the
district's
policy
were
in
some
disarray
and
i
do
not
know
what
was
being
done
with
respect
to
that
aspect
their
regulation.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
--
i
would
like
to
reply
very
briefly
only
to
a
couple
of
points.
the
district
does
not
concede
the
validity
of
a
1983
cause
of
action
against
superintendent
snowgrass
(ph)
individually.
there
is
nothing
alleged
in
the
pleading
in
our
view
that
shows
any
nexus
or
connection
between
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
that
man
and
mrs.
berg's
claims.
it
is
very
troublesome
representing
public
agencies,
try
some
officer
picked
out
and
slammed
with
a
suit
when
he
is
two
or
three
points
removed
from
what
actually
happened.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
oh
there
is
no
question
on
the
sick
leave.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
true,i
think
on
that
issue.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
i
basically
do.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
of
course
--
that
is
the
point
at
which
i--
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
i
have
to
rely
upon
the
attorney
fee
award.
unheard
legal
right
to
get
attorney's
fees.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes
but
there
of
course
are
two
issues.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
oh
yes
the
sick
leave
issue
is
not
moot.
the
issue
of
the
right
of
the
district
to
require
medical
examination,
the
right
of
the
district
to
have
the
last
say
on
the
question
of
leave
for
maternity
is
one
that
has
been
manifestly
affected
by
a
change
in
california
law.
i
would
hope
though
that
the
court
would
take
into
account
the
fact
this
was
the
change
that
was
made
because
the
legislature
thought
that
the
federal
law
required
the
contrary.
now
that
is
something
quite
unique
in
terms
of
the
history
of
this
court
and
its
examination
and
legislation
and
its
effect
on
question
of
mootness
because
by
virtue
of
that
legislation
we
did
not
get
reimbursed
for
the
additional
costs
that
we
had
to
incur
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
your
honor
when
i
say
cost,
i
am
talking
about
costs
of
that
whole
sick
leave
program.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
yes.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
oh
yes.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
judgment
is
vacated,
i
think
that
mrs.
dunlap's
award
of
attorney's
fees
is
vacated
as
well.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
oh
the
cost
that
we
incurred,
we
lost.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
we
are
now
all
kind
of
confused
as
to
what
question
is.
if
the
judgment
is
vacated
we
do
not
lose
our
costs
we
will
go
into
district
court
and
collect
them
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
prevail,
seems
to
me
we
were
have
been
the
prevailing
party
as
far
as
cost
of
suit
are
concerned.
now
mrs.
berg's
entitlement
to
sick
leave
is
something
that
remains
an
issue.
if
she
wins
in
this
law
suit,
she
will
be
entitled
to
recover
that
money
and
we
will
pay
it
to
her.
mr.
arthur
w.
walenta
that
is
right
and
those
members
of
the
class
in
that
intervening
period.
mr
justice
thank
you.
