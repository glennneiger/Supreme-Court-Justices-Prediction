justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett,
right
at
that
point
when
you
are
clarifying
the
parties,
is
it
gulf
or
the
southland
and
waddell
people
that
within
your
view
of
section
7b
is
the
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
did
not
suggest
that
el
paso
was
the
natural
gas
company
referred
to
---
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burnett,
just
because
you
focused
on
the
statutory
language
which
interests
me,
the
word
service
is
qualified
by,
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities,
and
that
such
facilities
in
turn
refer
back
to
its
facilities.
if
you
talk
about
gulf,
the
service
would
have
to
be,
“service
rendered
through
facilities
of
gulf,”
would
they
not?
by
just
reading
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
gulf
was
obligated
to
continue
providing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
stop
right
there
for
just
a
moment.
what
does
that
mean?does
that
mean
gulf
must
continue
to
provide
the
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
gulf
does
not
have
the
lease.
the
gulf’s
lease
has
expired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
gulf
is
simply,
it
was
not
a
question
of
reversion
of
the
list
but
gulf
had
some
oil
fields
and
they
simply
ran
out?
would
it
still
be
obligated
to
continue
furnishing
that
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett,
it
often
happens
that
gas
companies
get
in
a
fight
over
who
really
owns
the
land,
who
really
has
a
valid
lease.
suppose
gulf
went
to
the
commission
and
got
the
certificate
that
litigation
started
as
to
who
really
had
a
valid
lease
and
it
is
determined
in
court
that
gulf
had
no
lease
at
all.
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
gulf
would
have
to
ask
to
terminate
the
service
but
you
would
not
say
that
the
commission
would
deny
termination,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
that
person--
suppose
that
person
who
owns
it,
he
has
no
interest
in
continuing
the
service.
once
they
sell
in
intrastate
commerce,
has
not
any
interest
in
doing
what
gulf
had
been
doing
and
it
is
the
owner
of
the
lease.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
had
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
theory
the
commission
was
not
an
agency,
but
now
in
your
answer
to
justice
whites,
question,
it
sounds
like
you
saying
it
was
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burnett,
the
statutory
language
is
that
the
particular
facilities
must
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction.
is
it
your
view
that
the
lessor’s
interest
is
a
facility
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission?
well,
the
fact
that
the
lessor
operates
a
natural
gas
plant
up
in
maine
or
some
place
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case,
would
it?
the
fact
that
they
are
technically
a
natural
gas
company
is
not
dispositive.
it
must
be
operating
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
the
service
involved
must
be
performed
pursuant
to
those
facilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
its
facilities.
now,
you
say
exxon
is
a
lessee,
but
that
does
not
-
or
is
one
of
the
lessors
-
that
does
not
make
any
difference
unless
the
leasehold
interest
is
a
facility
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
services
rendered
by
means
of
such
facility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
seem
that
such
facilities
are
its
facilities
in
the
preceding
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
cut
through.
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
for
this
case
whether
the
lessor
is
some
individual
who
never
had
anything
to
do
with
gas
other
than
owning
the
lease
interest,
or
it’s
exxon
corporations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
really
do
not
make
any
point
out
of
the
careful
language
in
the
southland
brief
that
they
may
have
been
a
natural
gas
company
for
some
other
purpose.
that
is
your
role.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
a
totally
meritless
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
barnett,
i
am
interested
as
to
whether,
if
you
can
put
your
finger
on
where
you
think
the
commission
indicated
that
southland
should
be
held
to
have
dedicated
the
gas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
do
not
say
then
that
gulf
had
any
of
it?
do
you
say
that
the
commission
said
that
gulf
had
the
authority
on
behalf
of
southland
to
dedicate
all
of
the
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
your
argument
really
was
and
i
thought
the
commission’s
argument
was,
it
was
a
matter
of
service
and
even
if
gulf
was
breaching
its
contract,
breaching
its
lease
with
southland
in
asking
for
an
unlimited
certificate,
you
would
maybe
making
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
deutsch,
what
will
happen
to
that
gas
if
you
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
should
have
an
interest
in
being
sure
it
goes
to
california
instead
of
the
texas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what
is
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attwell,
while
you
are
interrupted,
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
gulf
was
under
an
obligation
to
apply
for
an
abandonment
because
they
had
a
certificate
and
in
effect
their
interest
in
the
leasehold
was
going
to
run
out.
they
had
an
obligation
to
do
so
and
they
failed
to
do
so.
what
would
be
the
consequences
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
remedial
power
to
do
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
saying
that
the
remedy,
if
they
were
under
a
duty,
if
they
acted
properly
by
following
the
request
to
abandon
and
if
the
commission
did
not
act
on
it,
they
would
not
have
abandoned
anyway
without
action.
they
may
be
subject
to
some
penalty
is
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
statute,
even
if
you
run
out,
you
have
got
to
file
a
petition
to
abandon,
do
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see
gulf
is
not
before
us
here
now.
they
are
a
party
to
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
but
not,
did
they
intervene
before
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
are
not
here
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
mr.
justice
white’s
question
was
not
necessarily
supporting
the
reasoning
of
the
commission
but
simply
independent
of
the
reasoning
of
the
commission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
could
not
he
tear
the
houses
down
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
the
zoning
change
to
tear
the
housing
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
least
he
has
the
power
to
discontinue
the
usage
of
the
property
for
the
purposes
have
been
used
for
during
the
lease.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
as
supposed
that
your
zoning
laws
probably
would
provide
for
notice
to
the
landlord
of
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
zoning
rules
and
he
would
have
a
chance
to
appear
and
oppose.
was
there
any
similar
notice
here
that
the
landlord
about
the,
i
mean
to
the
landlord
of
this
lease
about,
what
future
burden
there
might
be
on
his
property
if
the
gas
were
sold
interstate
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
how,
how
do
they
even
know
about
it?
how
do
they
even
know
about
the
proceeding?
the
zoning
case
that
you
give
us
is
a
similar
example;
they
are
entitled
as
some
matter
of
right
to
notice
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
commission
procedure
whereby
they
would
normally
and
the
normal
routine
be
given
notice
either
way—
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
wondering
how
far
you
pressed
your
hypothetical
example,
so,
in
one
case;
it
is
clearly
entitled
to
it,
the
other
they
may
or
may
not
have
gotten
it,
any
on
what
the
record
might
show.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
congress
recognize
the
same
practice
as
this
court
recognized
in
phillips?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
that
a
little
bit
more
to
me,
what
could
they
do?
say
a
lessee
came
in
with
a
ten
year
lease,
what
could
the
commission
do
to
be
sure
we
will
have
longer
sources
of
supply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
this
not
this
certificate
unlimited
in
duration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case?
