mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
grateful
for
the
10
minutes
that
has
been
allotted
to
me
to
express
some
concerns
which
we
have
for
these
broader
legal
implications
that
we
think
are
inherent
in
this
fpc
order
which
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
uphold
and
if
i
may
address
first
what
i
conceive
this
order
to
be
so
that
i
can
demonstrate
why
our
concerns
are
real
both
as
to
the
effect
of
this
order
on
the
stability
of
our
domestic
drilling
program
which
affects
this
entire
nation,
its
effect
on
our
state
lands
which
we
own
and
of
course
its
effect
on
our
consumers
whose
own
gas
supply
is
in
jeopardy
in
many
instances
by
this
order.
let
me
try
to
say
why
i
believe
this
order
conjures
up
kind
of
the
potentiality
of
many,
many
adverse
effects
on
established
legal
rights,
what
we
thought
were
established
legal
rights
prior
to
this
fpc
order.
the
order
states
on
its
face,
and
i
am
quoting
from
443
of
the
appendix:
“thus,
it
makes
no
different
whether
a
lease
is
transferred
or
terminated,
the
obligation
of
service
imposed
upon
the
dedicated
gas
continues.
the
duty
to
continue
to
serve
is
like
an
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land.”
so
in
this
order
the
fpc
has
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
gulf
here
created
a
federal
covenant
running
with
the
land
forever
by
making
an
interstate
sale
of
gulf
50-year
gas
commitment
under
this
lease
and
so
the
order
holds
that
although
the
land
owner
was
not
a
party
to
the
granting
of
that
certificate,
although
it
is
suggested
by
justice
rehnquist,the
land
owner
could
have
been
brought
in
as
a
condition
to
the
granting
of
that
certificate,
a
condition
to
gulf
that
was
not
done.
and
although
the
land
owner
clearly
is
not
a
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
7b,
and
although
southland
here
is
clearly
not
the
owner
of
any
facilities
being
used
in
service
within
the
meaning
of
7b,
and
although
the
land
owner
here
is
clearly
the
owner
of
different
gas,
gas
that
was
never
subjective
or
never
could
have
been
subjected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
--
they
use
the
word
“to
the
act”
-
you
cannot
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
by
an
application
gas
you
do
not
own.
whether
you
say
in
that
application,
justice
marshall,
that
i
am
just
applying
for
a
50-years
supply
or
whether
you
just
attached
your
lease,
you
simply
do
not
have
the
power
to
commit
in
that
application
any
gas
beyond
that
which
you
own
and
in
spite
of
all
that…
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
that
is
a
possibly
so
and
it
would,
whether
or
not
that
would
be
a
proper…
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
i
do
not
agree
with
that
and
i
think
it
would
also
portend
some
other
constitutional
questions
that
are
not
before
us
but
it
suffices
to
say
that
it
is
not…
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
i
am
not
addressing
constitutional
issues,
i
was
responding
to
you
to
say
that
i
think
an
effort
to
do
that,
whether
by
the
commission
or
by
the
congress
would
certainly
open
up
that
question.
but
it
is
enough
to
say
here
that
the
gas
from
the
acreage,
their
holding
that
the
gas
from
this
acreage
must
be
forever
sold
into
the
interstate
markets,
that
is
the
nubbin
of
our
complaint,
that
even
though
it
is
a
50-year
supply
and
a
50-year
lease,
that
by
this
so-called
covenant
running
with
the
land
theory
of
the
fpc
and
the
order,
that
even
after
that
lease
expires,
that
gas
has
still
to
be
sold
into
interstate
commerce.
now
that
legal
resolve
of
that
order
bothers
texas
because
if
gas
is
discovered
in
the
future
in
our
state,
and
we
think
a
great
deal
will
be
discovered
in
the
future
i
hope
for
the
good
of
this
country
that
it
will
be.
if
that
gas
is
discovered
from
a
lease
that
has
previously
been
under
an
expired
lease,
and
i
assure
this
court
and
we
set
it
out
in
our
brief
by
checking
with
our
land
holdings
that
we
know
on
the
instance
of
state
owned
lands
that
there
are
many
unexpired
leases,
some
as
many
as
eight
and
nine
expired
leases
and
i
mean
expired
for
legitimate
purposes.
if
under
any
of
those
expired
leases
it
could
be
discovered
later,
if
this
fpc
order
here
holds
up,
that
there
was
some
interstate
gas
sold
back
up
the
road
even
though
it
petered
out
and
is
no
longer
in
the
game
that
that
would
create
a
covenant
running
with
that
land
so
as
to
commit
any
new
gas
produced
from
that
acreage
into
interstate
commerce
forever.
it
takes
little
imagination
to
see
what
effect
that
has
on
the
stability
of
titled
searches
a
stability
of
drilling
programs
to
know
where
you
stand
when
you
go
in
to
make
these
deep
tests
which
we
are
increasingly
having
to
make
to
find
gas
in
this
country
and
as
justice
white
observed,
this
order
here
is
broad
enough
to
cover
a
situation
where
a
obtains
a
certificate
from
the
fpc
and
then
gets
in
litigation
with
b
who
claims
that
he
really
owns
the
lease,
even
though
a
in
good
faith
thought
he
owned
it
and
b
wins.
b,
in
spite
of
the
fact
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
certification
process,
who
was
not
involved
top,
side
or
bottom,
could
be
held
under
this
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land
theory
in
this
order
to
be
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction
to
interstate
commerce
sale
and
to
abandonment
procedures
for
actions
that
he
totally
were
un-authorized
for
him
and
in
which
he
had
no
participation
and
presumably
no
knowledge.
now
then,
when
a
producer
in
texas
is
leasing
today
for
new
exploratory
purposes
under
this
order
in
the
breadth
of
this
order,
that
producer
would
have
no
assurance
at
all
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
previously
lease
applicable
to
that
acreage,
that
would
automatically
subject
his
acreage
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction
to
interstate
market…
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
but
they…
mr.
john
l.
hill
what
we
have
today
under
our,
so
long
as
gas
is
produced
and
that
is
the
way
most
of
our
lessees
agree,
when
there
is
no
gas
produced
in
the
past
or
primary
term,
the
lease
lapses.
that
is
the
typical
thing
that
happens
in
the
oil
industry
today
and
that
happens
six
times,
seven
times,
eight
times.sometimes
they
go
through
an
abandonment
procedure
and
sometimes
they
do
not
probably…
mr.
john
l.
hill
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
white,
the
theory
of
the
covenant
running
with
the
land…
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
would
not
because
that
does
not
change
this
order
that
says
that
we
are
establishing
a
covenant
running
with
the
land.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
would
answer
it
then
that
if
that
could
supplant
the
language
and
we
do
not
have
covenant
running
with
the
land
and
the
abandonment
proceeding
would
have
the
legal
effect
of
eliminating
entirely
the
notion
that
the
new
lessee
would
not
have
a
free
hand
to
come
in
and
produce,
if
he
found
gas
and
sell
it
wherever
he
wanted
to,
that
would
eliminate
our
concern
but
there
are
two
problems
to
it.
first,
this
court
has
got
to
deal
with
this
covenant
running
with
the
land
and
i
hope
you
will
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
they
would
and
he
inferred
from
his
answer
to
you
that
the
theory
of
this
decision
was
that
the
fpc
was
finding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
had
implicit
right,
that
southland
had
implicitly
authorized
the
dedication
of
their
gas
and
so
they
would
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
in
the
first
place
it
does
not
satisfy
because
there
are
a
number,
a
lot
of
our
acreage
in
texas
today
where
we
have
reason
to
believe
there
was
some
fire
interstate
sale
but
it
petered
out,
there
is
no
more
production
and
no
abandonment
was
sought.
now
what
do
we
do
about
that
kind
of
a
situation?
we
would
go
back
now,
is
this
court
going
to
write
some
rule
about
the
abandonments
or
i
think
what
the
court
should
do,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
to
hold
now
in
this
case
is
squarely
and
clearly
that
a
producer’s
interstate
service
obligation
cannot
be
broader
or
longer
than
its
property
right
to
sell
gas.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
understood
him
to
ask
me
would
it
satisfy
our
concern
about
the
problems
associated
with
newly
discovered
gas,
if
there
was
some
requirement
that
the
lessee,
once
the
lease
has
been
extinguished
by
production
was
required
as
a
matter
of
absolute
requirement
to
go
and
obtain
an
abandonment
under
7b.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
that
would
eliminate
in
other
word
this
abandonment…
mr.
john
l.
hill
with
one
provision
if
you
right
out
of
any
attempt
to
the
fpc
to
right
in
to
our
law
this
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land
theory
because
that
is
a
broader
concept
than
abandonment.
mr.
john
l.
hill
so,
if
we
do
not
have
an
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land
coming
out
of
this
case
and
if
the
court
holds
that
no
producer
can
obligate
gas
that
he
does
not
own
and
that
abandonment
procedures
would
be
mandatory,
then
we
would
have
something
that
we
could
work
with
but
there
are
so
many
potentialities
for
harm
when
you
are
faced
here
with
the
order
like
this.
stating
that
we
are
finding
first
that
there
is
a
covenant
running
with
the
land;
we
are
finding
second
that
a
person
can
deal
in
gas
beyond
its
lease
term;
we
are
finding
third
that
if
the
lease
is
already
expired
and
there
is
no
longer
any
production,
if
there
has
not
been
an
abandonment
proceeding,
that
this
and
even
though
you
do
not
know
about
it
and
have
not
picked
it
up
in
a
title
search
and
you
go
out
and
spend
a
vast
amount
of
money
and
find
new
gas
we
can
come
back
and
put
it
into
interstate
commerce.
those
are
the
facts
in
this
order.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir,
i
do
not;
i
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
gas
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fpc
in
the
first
place,
as
justice
burger
pointed
out,
7b
applies
only
to
that
gas
over
which
the
commission
had
jurisdiction.
it
is
my
belief
that
the
application
when
it
is
filed,
given
to
the
commission,
only
jurisdiction
over
the
gas
which
the
applicant
owns,
you
cannot
confer
jurisdiction
on
someone
over
something
you
do
not
own
or
possess.
gulf
possessed
a
50-year
lease;
that
is
all
they
possessed.
they
had
no
ability
to
place
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fpc
something
that
they
did
not
have.
the
reversionary
interest
to
southland
which
came
in
after
the
50-year
period
was
totally
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
so
it
is
clearly
not
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
or
that
act
that
gas
which
you
do
not
own
you
can
place
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
it
is
not
like
sunray
written
by
justice
brennan
because
in
sunray
the
only
thing
we
were
dealing
with
was
a
contract
to
purchase.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
a
property
interest,
what
was
the
extent
of
the
property
interest.
i
think
that
issue
has
to
be
met
squarely
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
texas
for
reasons
that
we
have
outlined
in
our
amicus
brief,
joined
in
the
most
of
the
basic
arguments
that
has
been
presented
by
southland,
i
would
not
want
us
to
be
in
agreement
here,
not
that
it
is
material
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
we
would
not
want
to
be
in
agreement
that
congress
could
authorize
a
lessee
to
contract
the
gas
that
he
did
not
own,
nor
would
we
want
to
be
in
agreement
concerning
any
congressional
authority
to
control
intrastate
gas.
but
since
neither
one
of
those
matters
are
in
our
opinion
essential
to
the
issue
here
let
me
turn
to
section
7(b)
which
is
the
heart
of
this
case
and
state
why
the
state
of
texas
cares
about
this
case
and
what
our
interest
is
that
we
conceive
it.
and
sustaining
the
circuit
court’s
decision
and
overturning
the
federal
power
commission
order
in
this
case.
section
7(b)
as
we
have
been
over
and
over,
speaks
of
no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
now,
we
say
first
that
the
congressional
intent
as
well
as
the
clear
reading
of
section
7(b)
would
require
you
to
hold
in
this
case
that
southland
royalty
is
not
a
natural
gas
company
with
then
the
meaning
of
7(b)
that
gulf
is
the
only
natural
gas
company
that
would
come
within
that
definition
or
meaning.
then
when
it
says
facilities,
we
ask
that
you
hold
that,
facilities
contemplated
in
this
case
are
only
the
lease
that
gulf
took,
its
lease,
that
that
is
the
facilities,
the
50
year
term
lease
or
that
that
would
be
the
facilities
in
any
interpretation
of
7(b)
would
be
the
lease
taken
by
the
lessee
and
that
the
service
intended
is
the
gas
covered
by
that
lease
and
not
any
other
gas,
not
any
reversionary
interest
of
anyone
else
and
then
it
is
a
misreading
of
the
federal
power
commission
act
to
say
that
the
mere
dedication
of
a
lessee’s
interest
to
interstate
service.
in
some
way,
not
ever
stated
by
congress
would
then
mean
that
as
long
as
that
gas
were
flowing
it
would
also
authorize
the
bringing
in
under
that
service
or
that
facility,
gas
which
the
lessee
did
not
even
own
in
the
first
place
or
would
extend
the
gas
that
was
found
after
that
particular
lease
were
abandoned.
we
say
that
is
a
total
misreading
and
a
stretching
of
the
federal
power
commission
authority
and
that
the
congress
intends
that
it
should
say
so
and
then
and
only
then
would
we
be
facing
the
issue
that
is
being
inquired
about
in
some
of
the
questions
then
we
would
certainly
want
to
raise
constitutional
objections
to
it.
but
that
is
not
here,
that
it
is
not
intended
and
the
reason
that
we
are
concerned
with
any
rule
that
would
emanate
from
this
case,
if
brought
at
the
federal
power
commission
order
and
let
me
refer
to
it
again,
it
said,
the
duty
to
continue
to
serve
is
like
an
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land.
now
that
is
a
very,
very
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
says
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
or
a
new
covenant,
a
new
ancient
or
middle
aged,
if
to
us,
a
very,
very
novel
doctrine
with
no
authority
to
support
it
and
totally
unprecedented
in
universal
law.
and
that
has
to
bother
us
because
we
own
16
million
acres
of
land
in
our
state,
the
state
of
texas
does,
we
are
far
and
away
are
the
largest
land
owner.
and
we
have
4,000
expired
leases
that
we
have
discovered
this
since
1944
covering
over
2
million
acres
of
land
in
our
state.
now,
that
is
just
for
owners,
that
is
just
what
could
say
in
going
over
in
the
general
land
office
for
purposes
of
this
case
and
when
you
are
faced
with
the
possibility
of
a
rule
about
a
covenant
running
with
the
land
that
could
mean
that
the
interstate
dedication
would
extend
beyond
the
lessee’s
interest
whether
not
there
have
been
an
abandonment.
you
can
see
why
our
state
would
be
very
concerned
and
the
havoc
if
that
that
could
cause
not
only
in;
and
because
most
of
the
abandonments
have
not
been
carried
out,
it
would
mean
that
our
people
are
trying
to
do
business
with
us
would
find
it
very,
is
this
mean
my
time
is
expired?
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
would
mean
certainly
that
people
that
are
trying
to
deal
with
the
state
of
texas
in
taking
these
leases,
if
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
and
they
do
not,
you
cannot
find
these
contracts
that
are
made
and
utilized
for
interstate
service,
they
are
not
recorded
in
any
court
house
anywhere.
you
cannot
find
them,
you
could
come
up
here
and
dig
around
in
the
fpc
file,
if
you
wanted
to
be
that
diligent
but
we
have
not
found
their
files
to
be
all
that
up
to
date.
and
it
placed
a
tremendous
burden,
to
try
to
run
down
all
those
gas
contract
and
how
are
you
going
to
know
when
some
contract
--
well,
you
cannot,
the
lease
is
down
there
but
you
cannot
go
find
every
unexpired
lease,
we
found
leases
where
there
nine
unexpired.
we
found
land
with
a
nine
unexpired
leases.
how
are
you
going
to
know
whether
in
some
prior
lease,
25
or
30
years
ago,
maybe
someone
had
a
dedication
of
some
gas
into
an
interstate
market
then
the
gas
trickled
out
and
the
lease
expired
and
someone
went
on
to
the
next
deal.
do
you
mean
that
when
we
are
going
to
deal
with
people
now,
to
try
to
get
new
leases,
to
encourage
them
to
go
out
and
drill
this
deep
wells
and
have
this
exploration
that
they
have
got
to
try
to
determine
whether
someone
years
ago
might
have
had
some
lease
that
under
which
there
were
some
sale
of
gas
in
an
interstate
market
and
by
that
be
bound
now
to
sell
their
gas
regardless
of
the
circumstances
and
the
interstate
market?
you
can
see
the
tremendous
dampening
influence,
that
would
have
on
expiration
at
the
time
when
we
are
all
trying
to
encourage
expiration
and
you
can
see
the
cloud
that
it
would
flip
over
a
title
than
our
ability
as
a
land
owner
to
do
business
and
that
is
why
the
rule
should
be
plain
and
simply
as
the
circuit
court
has
put
it.
and
that
is
if
the
lessee
can
sell
only
what
he
owns,
that
always
been
the
law
that
should
remain
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
this
case
before.
there
is
nothing
else
that
gulf
had
except
50
years
to
sell,
that
is
the
gas
they
had,
that
is
the
worth—
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
you
see
there
would
never
be
any
authorization.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
if
you
leave
it
in
the
interstate.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
but
not,
if
it
is
an
involuntary
sale.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
gulf
would
be
in
effect
forcing
southland
to
sell
its
gas
whether
they
want
it
to
or
not
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
by
what
law—
mr.
john
l.
hill
--
that
the
lessor
did
not
have
one
thing
in
the
world
to
do.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
would
just
be
an
involuntary
forcing
of
southland
to
sell
its
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir,
and
we
are
not
worried,
the
price
is
not
the
issue
here.
california
talks
about
its
consumers,
it
talks
about
how
many
homes
it
will
heed
in
california
and
they
talked
about
losing
gas.
they
have
no
gas
to
lose
because
this
gas
was
never
dedicated
and
to
interstate
service
beyond
the
50
year
term.
southland
did
not
dedicate
its
gas,
they
are
begging,
they
are
bootstrapping
themselves,
they
are
just
begging
the
question
when
they
say
that
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
southland
has
the
right
to
sell
it
to
texas
and
we
are
here
to
say
that
it
is
our
gas
now
and
that
it
would
not
dedicate
it
under
the
previous
transaction
that
all
gas
did
sale
with
its
50
years
supply,
that
everyone
knew
that
going
in.
el
paso
knew
what
it
was
buying,
50
years.
gulf
did
not
sell
something
they
did
not
own,
they
have
had
it
now,
their
gas
is;
their
rights
have
been
exhausted
under
the
only
lease
that
existed
and
now—
nobody
is
suggesting
gulf’s
rights
are
going
to
go
on
is
it?
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
because
gulf,
you
see,
gulf
has
filed
an
abandonment.
mr.
john
l.
hill
why
do
they
not
act
on
it
that,
is
a
very
good
question,
it—
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely.
mr.
john
l.
hill
gulf
said
only
what
it
owned.
