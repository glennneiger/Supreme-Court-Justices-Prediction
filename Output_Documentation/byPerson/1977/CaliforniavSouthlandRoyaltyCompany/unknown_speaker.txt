unknown
speaker
it
was
not
at
any
agency
theory
then,
it
was
just
the
idea
that
if
the
lessee
had
dedicated
it,
it
was
automatically
dedicated
when
the
lease
reverted.
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
in
good
faith
like
a
lot
of
people
do
they
just
get
the
title
question
--
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think
the
commission,
as
a
matter
of
law
or
of
fact,
said
that
it
did?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
of
law
that
--
everybody
who
takes
a
lease
or
anybody
who
gives
a
lease
must
understand
under
the
natural
gas
act
that
the
lessee
has
the
power
under
the
national
gas
act
to
dedicate
permanently.
is
that
what
the
commission
said?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
even
prospectively
as
well
as
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
the
same
transaction
happens
tomorrow.
every
lessor
then
knows
what
the
commission’s
rule
is.
unknown
speaker
was
it
required
too
or
would
there
have
been
some
breach
of
lease
or
a
breach
of
the
duty
under
the
lease
if
it
just
had
not
sold
anything?
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
not
breaching
the
lease
by
selling
in
the
interstate
market?
unknown
speaker
or
a
new
covenant.
unknown
speaker
or
a
new
covenant.
unknown
speaker
nobody’s
trying
to
sell
the
lessor’s
gas,
it
is
just
a
question
whether
he
must
stay
in
the
interstate
market.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
nobody—;
gulf
is
not
trying,
nobody
is
suggesting
that
gulf
has
the
right
to
sell
the
lessor’s
gas.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
it
will
still
be
the
lessor
selling
it.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
it
will
still
be
him
selling
it.
it
would
not
be
gulf
selling
it.
unknown
speaker
the
laws
were
construed
as
the
commission
says
that
it
would
be
the
law
that
is
making
the
lessor
stay
in
the
intestate
market,
gulf
is
out.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
position
on
that
but
nevertheless
that
would
be,
gulf
would
be
out
in
the
lessor
or
be
it
and
the
lessor
would
be
making
the
sales—
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
argument
in
that
the
effect—
unknown
speaker
and
at
those
price.
unknown
speaker
the
issue
in
the
case
is
it,
in
what
market
may
be
gas
be
sold
--
unknown
speaker
well
general
hill,
is
that
quite
right?if
the
commission
is
correct
in
holding
that
the,
it
was
like
a
covenant
running
with
the
land
and
the
landlord’s
gas
is
permanently
dedicated,
why
not,
why
would
not
the
commission
have
the
power
to
deny
gulf’s
petition
for
abandonment
and
keep
gulf
in
the
picture?
because
it
would
still
have
resources
supply?
unknown
speaker
if
the
supply
is
still
available
why
did
they;
they
may
deny
the
petition
for
abandonment,
may
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
gulf
is
out
of
the
picture
if
the
gas
is
still
there?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that
mr.
barnett,
cannot
the
lessor
at
least
illinois
has
to
stay
in
the
interstate
market
at
least
get
rid
of
his
lessee?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
cannot
be
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
substitute—
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
lessors
since
i
would
hold,
when
the
lessee’s
expired,
i
understand
that
i
have
to
stay
in
the
interstate
market
but
i
do
want
to
deal
with
gulf
anymore.
unknown
speaker
what
about
itself,
southland?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
equipped.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are,
you
have
answered
your--
i
am
sure
it
is
not
intentional
this
when
you
have
given
contradictory
answers
to
justice
white
and
to
justice
stevens.
did
you
say
that
the
commission
can
rearrange
the
legal
arrangements
of
the
parties;
that
is
a
rather
strange
notion
to
emanate
from
the
statute
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
take
the
position
mr.
barnett
that
by
virtue
of
gulf’s
dedication,
the
commission
acquired
greater
power
over
southland
that
it
has
over
gulf?
unknown
speaker
does
it
also
have
power
to
require
gulf
to
stay
in
the
picture,
assuming
you
are
right
on
southland—?
unknown
speaker
as
lessee—
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
deny
the
petition
for
abandonment
even
though
the
source
or
supply
remains
available,
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
—if
its
act
on
it,
can
it
deny
it,
that
is
my
question.
does
the
commission
have
the
power
to
a,
hold
that
southland’s
gas
must
remain
available
and
b,
we
are
going
to
deny
gulf’s
petition
for
abandonment,
does
it
have
such
power?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
think
you
could
or
do
you?
i
do
not
know
what
your
answer
is
now.
may
the
commission
keep
deny
gulf’s
petition
for
abandonment
and
make
it
stay
in
the
picture
over
southland’s
objection.
unknown
speaker
well
i
suppose
that
there
is
one
reason
for
requiring
a
lessee
under
an
expiring
lease
to
file
is
just
at
least
to
make
sure
that
the
lease
is
expiring
and
it
is
not
just
a
trumped
up
arrangement.
