mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
ebenezer
attwell
and
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
southland
royalty
company
et
all.
i
would
like
to
start
out
by
briefly
summarizing
our
position
and
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold.
then
i
want
to
turn
to
the
reasons
why
southland’s
gas
was
not
involuntarily
dedicated
to
interstate
service
because
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
gulf's
share
of
the
waddell
ranch
gas.
finally,
i
want
to
conclude
with
a
discussion
of
the
practical
consequences
of
this
court
holding
for
southland.
our
position
is
very
simple
but
it
is
very
fundamental.
it
is
that
you
cannot
sell
what
you
never
owned
nor
you
you
dedicate
what
you
never
owned.
this
is
true
as
a
matter
of
property
law
and
it
is
also
true
under
the
natural
gas
act.
therefore,
this
case
does
not
present
a
conflict
between
state
property
law
on
the
one
hand
and
the
natural
gas
act
on
the
other,
nor
does
it
involve
the
withdrawal
or
diversion
of
dedicated
gas
from
the
interstate
market.
we
recognize
that
if
our
gas
has
been
dedicated,
then
in
the
words
of
justice
brennan
in
sunray,
there
can
be
no
withdrawal
of
that
supply
from
continued
interstate
movement
without
commission
approval.
but
none
of
southland’s
gas
has
ever
flowed
in
interstate
commerce
except
under
compulsion
of
the
commission’s
orders
in
this
case
and
those
orders
expressly
provide
that
such
for
sales
by
southland
are
without
prejudice
to
its
rights
in
this
case.
therefore,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
southland’s
share
of
the
waddell
ranch
gas
was
somehow
dedicated
to
interstate
service
because
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
its
share
of
the
waddell
ranch
gas.
we
recognize
and
agree
that
this
dedication
question
is
to
be
decided
under
the
natural
gas
act.
we
say
that
because
gulf
was
never
--
and
i
emphasize
the
word
‘never’
--
possessed
of
any
rights
in,
or
control
over
southland’s
interest
in
the
waddell
ranch
gas,
it
could
not,
it
did
not
encumber
that
gas
with
an
interstate
service
obligation.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
it
did
say
that
in
its
opinion,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
the
commission
said
that
it
was
holding
that
gulf
had
the
power
and
did
exercise
the
power
to
dedicate
southland’s
gas.
now
the
commission
equivocates
as
to
where
it
got
that
power.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
it
congress
wanted
to
preempt
the
whole
deal--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
right,
that
is
just
like
saying
that
a
natural
gas
act
said
that
a
could
dedicate
b's
gas.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
like
to
take
up
if
i
may
where
we
left
off
before
the
luncheon
recess.
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
had
asked
what
if
congress
had
said
that
a
could
dedicate
b’s
gas,
that
gulf
could
dedicate
southland’s
gas.
we
think
it
is
very
clear
from
the
natural
gas
act
that
congress
did
not
say
that.
now,
the
commission
has
made
references
to
section
7b
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
abandonment
section.
we
think
that
is
really
kind
of
a
big
question
in
this
case
which
is
whether
our
gas
is
dedicated.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
right,
that
is
exactly
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
think
you
are
looking
at
the
wrong
section.
7b
applies
to
dedicated
gas
it
does
not
apply
to
undedicated
gas.
what
section
applies
here,
how
do
you
determine
what
a
lessee
could
dedicate?
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
absolutely,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
he
did
not
have
any
potential,
he
had
none
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
any
interest
to
property
right
he
had,
yes.
no
question
about
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no,
the
texas
supreme
court
in
1973,
in
its
decision
made
it
very
clear
that
all
that
gulf
oil
corporation
got
under
its
lease
was
gas
that
was
found,
produced
within
a
specified
50-year
term
ending
july
14,
1975.
when
that
day
went
bang,
that
was
the
end
of
any
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
do
not
think
it
is
physically
possible
but
i
am
sure
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
one
way
or
another.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.obviously,
that
was
physically
possible.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
right,
and
that
is
all
that
it
could
dedicate
under
its
lease.
let
me
back
to
my
question
as
to
the
proper
section
of
the
natural
gas
act.
i
think
we
need
to
look
to,
to
see
the
extent
of
dedication,
its
section
7e
not
section
7b.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
that
says
a
certificate
shall
be
issued
to
any
qualified
applicant,
therefore,
authorizing
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
operation,
sales,
service,
construction,
extension
et
cetera;
if
it
is
found
that
the
applicant
is
able
and
willing
properly
to
do
the
acts
and
performance
perform
the
service.
gulf
was
never
able
to
perform
the
service
of
selling
southland
royalty’s
gas.
gulf
never
owned
any
interest
in
or
had
any
right
to
control
the
disposition.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
would
say
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
southland
royalty
has
made
a
contract
to
sell
its
gas
intrastate
commerce,
but
not
gulf.
gulf
sold
all
of
the
gas
it
was
entitled
under
the
50-year
lease
to
el
paso.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
because
we
have
a
separate
independent
property
interest,it
has
never
been
dedicated.
it
is
just
like
we
had
white
acre
over
here
black
acre
over
here.
white
acre
was
dedicated
by
gulf,
we
owned
black
acre
and
we
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
sell
our
gas
in
intrastate
commerce.
we
are
entitled
to
sell
it
to
the
purchaser
of
our
choice.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
at
least
as
of
the
present
moment.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
it
would
have
violated
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission
and
of
course
the
natural
gas
act
that
gives
the
commission,
the
remedial
power,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
remedial
power
to
see
the
either
punish
gulf
or
to
make
them
forcing
to
file
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
this
case
justice
stevens,
that
gulf
filed
an
application
to
abandon
over
two
years
ago,
and
it
has
is
been
sitting
up
with
the
federal
power
commission
and
nothing
has
happened.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
believe
it
does,
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
i
believe
it
was
filed
pursuant
to
the
very
orders
that
are
under
review
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
am
saying
that
they
are
not
subject
to
any
penalty
for
the
abandonment
because
all
the
gas,
that
gulf
had
was
sold
and
delivered
to
el
paso.
it
completely
performed
a
service.
it
was
just
like
--
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
asked
the
question,
what
would
happen
if
you
just
ran
out
of
gas?
if
gulf
had
just
ran
out,
what
would
happen?
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
correct,
and
they
have
filed
one,
and
it
has
been
pending
there
for
two
years.
but
i
will
admit
that
is
a
pro
forma
because
the
statute
says
if
your
reserves
are
completed
to
the
extent
further
service
is
unwarranted,
and,
presumably
gulf
meets
that
standard.
but
an
application
to
abandon
has
been
filed
and
it
has
been,
so
i
do
not
think
what
the
technical
point
is.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
texas
supreme
court
that
i
referred
o,
a
1973
decision,
which
conclusively
established
the
limitations
on
gulf’s
power
under
its
lease,
inclusively
established
that
gulf
had
absolutely
no
power
under
that
lease
to
dedicate
southland’s
gas.
also
in
its
full
and
complete
answer
to
any
suggestion
that
southland
has
successor
interest
to
gulf
and
therefore
bound
by
gulf’s
dedication
of
gulf's
gas.
a
successor
of
course
is
one
who
acquires
his
predecessors’
estate
and
takes
that
estate
subject
to
any
benefits
or
infirmities
but
in
this
case
when
gulf’s
lease
expired,
it
ceased
to
exist.
there
was
nothing
left;
there
was
nothing
to
be
transferred.
southland
did
not
require
gulf’s
lease
voluntarily
or
otherwise.
southland
had
a
continuing
presently
vested
property
interest.
i
think
that
the
texas
supreme
court
decision
is
also
an
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
some
type
of
agency
under
which
gulf
acted
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
this
record
and
from
the
law
that
gulf
had
absolutely
no
agency
whatsoever
to
act
on
behalf
of
southland
royalty.
in
the
past,
the
commission
has
consistently
recognized
that
a
producer
cannot
dedicate
what
it
does
not
own.
in
fact
just
45
days
ago,
the
new
commission
reversed
a
decision
of
the
old
commission
and
held
that
when
producer
a
dedicated
his
interest
in
a
gas
reserve,
it
did
not
dedicate
producer
b’s,
because
producer
a
had
no
authority
to
dedicate
producer
b’s
gas
and
it
had
no
ownership
right
in
it.
but
in
this
case
the
commission
has,
for
the
first
time
to
our
knowledge,
ignored
the
fundamental
principal
and
held
that
when
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
its
gas,
it
could
and
did
dedicate
our
gas,
even
though
gulf
never
had
any
ownership
or
other
interest
of
any
kind.
in
so
holding
we
submit
the
commission
clearly
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
natural
gas
act.
first,
we
believe
it
is
clear
our
gas
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
do
not
follow.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
a
good
point.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
absolutely,
and
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear,
mr.
justice
white,
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
one,
fixed
term
lease
is
the
kind
we
are
dealing
with
here,
are
unique
animals;
they
went
into
disuse
in
the
late
1920s
and
the
reason
they
went
in
to
disuse
is
because
producers
are
just
not
going
to
undertake
investing
hundreds
of
thousand
of
millions
of
dollars
in
a
well
and
not
be
entitled
to
produce
all
of
the
gas
that
comes
out
of
the
well.
when
it
disused
in
the
modern
day,
or
at
least
provides
that
the
producer’s
lease
rights
continue
so
long
as
production
continues
in
paying
quantities.
so,
you
are
not
faced
with
a
specter
of
this
happening
or
going
to
these
things
coming
up
from
the
past.
more
or
less
like
when
you
issued
your
sunray
decision,
you
were
contemporaneously
faced
with
the
specter
of
the
sun
oil
decision
with
those
old
certificates
coming
up
and
if
you
did
not
hold
as
you
did
in
sunray,
then
those
older
certificates
would
have
terminated.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
gulf’s
application
to
the
federal
power
commission
clearly
shows
that
all
it
was
dedicating
was,
as
far
as
a
waddell
ranch
gas
is
concerned
was
its
interest
under
its
lease.
now,
gulf’s
application
does
not
come
out
and
say
it
is
limited
to
50
years,
it
just
identifies
the
lease.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes,
and
it
identifies
a
great
number
of
leases.
i
want
you
to
understand
that
gulf’s
application,
gulf
had
a
processing
plant
here
and,
under
its
certificate,
it
took
gas
from
a
great
number
of
sources,
including
one
of
those
was
the
waddell
ranch.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
as
the
gas
run
out,
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
could
not
have
said
it
better
myself.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
did.
whatever
gulf
owned,
it
is
our
position
that
what
gulf
owned
at
the
time
of
dedication,
that
determined
the
scope
and
extent
of
dedication
and
all
gulf
owned
was
the
right
to
produce
gas
from
the
waddell
ranch
for
a
defined
50-year
term.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes,
i
think
there
are
some
statements
that
we
quote,
justice
white,
about
what
--
from
the
commission’s
orders
about
what
a
difficult
question…
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that
this
situation
is
so
rare
and
unique
that
this
is
the
first
time
it
was
confronted
with
such
a
situation.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
there
is
a
lot
of
different
language
in
sunray,
i
read
it
a
lot
of
times.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
we
are
not
basing
our
argument
in
this
sense
to
some
facts
that
are
expectations
of
any
kind.
we
are
not
saying
that
because
our
expectations
were
one
way
in
1925
and
different
obviously
now…
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
we
would
certainly
say
that,
yes.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
correct.
the
commissions
relies
on
justice
brennan's
sunray
opinion
to
support
its
flow
theory
we
believe
is
equally
misplaced
in
this
case
because
the
record
clearly
shows
that
southland
has
never
sold
any
of
its
gas
voluntarily,
at
least
in
the
interstate
commerce.
the
only
physical
flow
that
gulf
could
indeed
dedicate
to
interstate
service
was
gulf’s
leasehold
gas,
a
50-year
flow,
and
once
gulf
commenced
that
flow
the
service
had
to
continue.
sunray
made
it
very
clear
that
it
could
not
withdraw
that
supply
and
gulf
has
delivered
all
the
leasehold
gas
but
now
gulf’s
supply
is
gone;
it
flowed
and
it
is
gone,
and
they
applied
for
abandonment.
that
in
no
way
supports
the
commission’s
position
that
gulf’s
flow
of
gulf
gas
somehow
bound
southland,
and
we
also
recognize
that
under
sunray,
the
certificate
issued
to
gulf
imposed
a
service
obligation
that
was
obviously
separate
and
apart
from
the
sale
or
obligation
imposed
by
this
contract,
but
gulf’s
service
obligation
applied
only
to
gulf’s
share
of
the
waddell
ranch.
the
capacity
of
a
producer
to
dedicate
natural
gas
reserves
we
say
is
limited
to
the
producer’s
ownership
rights
in
such
reserves
and
does
not
extend
to
gas
which
the
producer
never
had
any
ownership
or
other
interest
in.
let
me
illustrate
that
by
saying
that
throughout
the
industry
it
is
very
commonplace
for
there
to
be
a
number
of
different
interest
owners
in
gas
reserves.
in
fact
that
is
lot
more
common
than
the
contract
and
it
is
has
been
well
established
that
if
one
producer
in
that
gas
reserve
makes
a
sale
of
his
interest,
it
in
no
way
band
binds
or
covers
the
other
producers,
and
we
say
that
is
exactly
the
same
thing
here.
here
is
the
waddell
ranch,
gulf
makes
a
sale
of
its
interest,
that
is
no
way
binding
on
us.
we
say
that
is
exactly
analogous.
nor
is
it
significant,
we
submit,
that
gulf
was
issued
a
certificate
of
unlimited
duration
in
this
gas.
that
simply
meant
that
gulf
was
obligated
to
sell
all
of
its
waddell
ranch
gas.
it
did
not
mean
that
gulf
was
somehow
authorized
to
sell
gas
it
did
know.
we
would
note
that
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
far
different
in
what
faced
you
in
sunray.
in
that
case,
this
court
required
the
producer
to
continue
selling
his
only
gas
after
the
term
of
his
contract
because
of
its
service
obligation
imposed
by
its
certificate.
in
sunray,
the
producer
clearly
had
the
right
and
power
to
continue
to
sell
his
gas
after
the
contract
expired.
by
contrast,in
the
present
case
gulf
never
had
any
power
or
right
to
sell
waddell
ranch
gas
after
its
lease
expired.
therefore,
gulf’s
service
obligation
could
not
have
extended
to
southland’s
gas;
gulf
was
not
able
in
fact
to
sale
southland’s
gas.
in
my
remaining
time
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
practical
consequences
of
holding
for
southland
in
this
case.
first,
i
think
as
far
as
this
is
narrow
case
is
concerned
the
consequences
or
at
the
minimums.
there
is
this
case
and
there
are
only
three
other
fixed
term
lease
cases
and
the
relative
volumes
of
gas
compared
to
the
over
all
minimums.
second,
holding
for
southland
in
this
case
will
not
mean
that
gas
dedicated
on
the
typical
life
of
reserves
lease
could
escape
from
interstate
service
if
such
a
lease
is
prematurely
terminated.
all
that
the
court
need
hold,
and
we
say
should
hold
in
this
case,
is
that
one
who
has
never
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
gas
cannot
dedicate
that
gas
to
interstate
service.
the
typical
life
of
reserves
lease
is
of
unlimited
duration
and
unlike
gulf
in
this
case
the
producer
has
the
power
at
the
time
of
dedication
to
dedicate
whatever
gas
it
finds.
i
do
not
think
petitioners
really
take
the
firm
position
that
the
holding
in
this
case
would
reach
that
result.
they
say
to
theory
of
this
case
might
be
expanded
to
bind
these
ordinary
lease
situations
where
the
producers
has
the
power
which
unlike
gulf
in
this
case
to
dedicate
gas.
it
does
dedicate
the
gas
and
then
the
lease
is
prematurely
terminated.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
circuit’s
decision
goes
that
far.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
fifth
circuit’s
decision
is
based
on
the
fact
that
gulf
had
no
interest
in
or
control
over
our
gas
reserves.
in
fact,
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
distinguished
it.
mr.
george
on
behalf
of
california
referred
you
to
a
recent
tenth
circuit
decision
in
which
the
commission
had
held
that
gas
was
dedicated
and
phillips
petroleum
company
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
commission
was
affirmed
and
the
tenth
circuit
said
southland
is
not
applicable
because
in
that
case,
the
lessee
gulf
oil
never
at
any
time
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
southland’s
gas.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
justice
marshall,
that
is
exactly
what
they
did
say.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
am
saying
that
after
50
years
they
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
any
gas
produced
in
the
waddell
ranch.
if
i
misspoke
myself,
i
apologize.
in
any
event,
if
there
is
any
question
obviously
in
this
court’s
mind
as
to
the
extent
of
the
opinion
below,
we
can
obviously
limit
to
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
which
is
whether
one
who
has
no
interest
in
or
control
over
gas
can
dedicate
that
gas
to
interstate
service.
such
a
holding,
we
submit,
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
the
contrary
holding
if
this
court
were
of
that
opinion
and
in
these
other
cases.
third,
it
is
our
position
that
holding
for
southland
in
this
case
is
not
going
to
in
any
way
result
in
this
parade
of
horrors
that
the
briefs
have
given
you,
this
proliferation
of
short
term
leases,
terminable
at
will
under
which
producers
can
limit
their
service
obligation
in
some
manner
and
there
by
switch
back
and
forth
between
the
interstate
and
intrastate
market.
the
suggestion
is
really
so
devoid
of
economic
reality
as
to
be
(inaudible).
in
response
to
earlier
questions,
i
pointed
out
with
producers
who
quit
entering
in
to
this
leases
many,
many
years
ago
for
economic
reasons
and
they
are
not
going
to
do
it
again
because
they
are
spending
hundreds
of
thousands
and
millions
of
dollars
on
these
wells
now
and
they
are
not
going
to
subject
themselves
to
a
situation
where
their
right
to
produce
any
gas
could
to
cut
off
in
five
years
or
could
be
even
worse
cut
off
at
the
will
of
the
lessor.
but
even
if
future
producers
should
try
to
do
that
and
should
approach
the
commission
with
an
application
to
make
such
a
sale
of
gas,
if
the
commission
determines
that
that
quantity
of
gas
that
limited
to
a
quantity
in
someway
jeopardizes
the
public
interest,
we
submit
that
it
has
and
can
and
will
protect
the
public
interest
just
as
it
is
done
by
refusing
to
issue
certificates
limited
to
the
term
of
a
producer’s
contract,
to
issue
the
certificate
or
condition
it
on
the
producer
obtaining
a
longer
and
more
stable
supply
of
gas.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
this
court
is
going
to
hold
against
southland,
it
is
going
to
have
to
adopt
in
effect
a
new
rule
of
law
in
our
opinion,
and
that
is
that
one
who
never
owned
or
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
gas
can
dedicate
that
gas
to
interstate
service.
as
we
previously
discussed,
the
authority
for
such
a
holding
will
have
to
be
found
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
whatsoever
in
the
natural
gas
act
to
indicate
that
congress
in
any
way
intended
such
a
radical
alteration
of
established
ownership
rights.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
two
points
that
we
think
are
controlling
in
this
case.
first,
a
producer
cannot
dedicate
gas
which
he
has
never
owned.
this
is
true
under
property
law
and
as
i
have
discussed,
it
is
true
under
the
natural
gas
act.
second,
gulf
never
owned
or
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
southland’s
gas
and
therefore
could
not
dedicate
such
gas.
from
these
two
simple
but
indisputable
points,
we
believe
it
is
clear
that
southland’s
gas
is
not
now
and
never
has
been
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce.
consequently,
southland
is
under
no
obligation
to
obtain
abandonment
authorization
under
section
7b
of
the
natural
gas
act
--
well
suppose
southland
can
sell
its
gas
to
the
purchaser
of
his
choice.
for
these
reasons
we
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below
on
the
ground
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
gulf
could
not
and
did
not
dedicate
southland’s
gas
to
interstate
service.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
a
great
deal
today
about
many
reasons
why
this
court
should
hold
that
southlands,
waddell
gas
has
been
somehow
dedicated
to
el
paso
in
interstate
commerce.
well,
i
have
heard
precious
little
about
the
natural
gas
act
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
the
basic
decision
be
rendered
by
the
court
is
the
power
of
a
lessee
through
the
natural
gas
act
to
commit
two
interstate
commerce,
the
gas
from
southland
royalty.
as
i
understand
the
commission’s
position
in
this
case,
it
is
that
it
concedes
one,
that
southland
has
never
dedicated
any
of
its
waddell
ranch
gas
to
el
paso,
and
two,
that
under
universal
common
law,
gulf
could
not
have
dedicated
the
southland’s
gas
because
gulf
and
southland
owned
two
separate
and
independent
interests.
instead,
the
commission
claims
that
the
waddell
ranch
gas
was
involuntarily
dedicated
when
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
gulf’s
leasehold
gas.
according
to
the
commission,
this
dedication
occurred
as
a
matter
of
law
under
the
natural
gas
act.
so
we
see
the
case
is
boiling
down
to
the
fundamental
issue
of
as
to
whether
congress
intended
for
the
natural
gas
act
to
abrogate
established
common
law
and
empower
private
party
such
as
gulf
oil
corporation
to
dedicate
gas
it
never
owned
,
never
had
any
interest
in
and
never
intended
to
dedicate.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
natural
gas
act
or
its
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
such
a
radical
result.
to
the
contrary,
the
plain
language
of
the
act
shows
that
gulf
could
not
dedicate
southland’s
gas.
in
considering
this
question
of
statutory
construction,
the
commission
would
have
you
focus
on
7(b)
of
the
act,
the
abandonment
section.
that
section
provides
that
if
a
natural
gas
company
undertakes
dedicated
service,
it
cannot
abandon
that
service
without
commission
authorization
but
the
commission
is
looking
at
the
wrong
section.
the
7(b)
merely
begs
the
question
because
it
applies
to
dedicated
gas.
here,
the
question
is
whether
southland’s
gas
has
ever
been
dedicated,
more
particularly
whether
southland’s
gas
was
somehow
dedicated
when
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
gulf’s
gas.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
sir,
justice
white.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
absolute,
well
he
had
a
duty
to
market
but
he
could
have
sold
in
the
interstate
market
or
the
intrastate
market.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no
sir,
he
was
not.
the
record
in
this
case
does
show
though
that
there
was
a
substantial
intrastate
market
in
the
permian
basin
area.
it
shows
that
in
fact
gulf
oil
corporation
on
these
varied
properties
that
are
at
issue
here,
sold
all
of
its
gas
well,
gas
and
some
of
its
casing
head
gas
in
the
intrastate
market.
so
there
was
an
intrastate
market
connected
into
these
very
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
do
not
follow
your
precedent
justice
white.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
correct.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
or
making
a
sale
or
gulf
making
a
sale
of
gulf’s
gas
in
the
interstate
market,
they
were
certainly
not
breaking
their
lease.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
lease
mr.
justice
white,
the
royalty
was
payable
on
$0.40
per
mcf,
for
thousand
feet
regardless
of
what
the
sales
price
the
gulf
got
for
his
gas.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
these
leases
were
no,
the
royalty
was
based
strictly
on
a
fixed
rate
of
$0.04
cents.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
in
determining
whether
gulf
could
dedicate
southland’s
gas,
we
submit
that
the
proper
section
of
the
act
to
be
looked
at
is
section
7(e).
that
section
says
that
a
certificate
shall
be
issued
any
qualified
applicant
who
is
able
and
willing
properly
to
do
acts
and
perform
the
service.
the
7(e)
makes
it
clear
that
in
order
for
a
producer
to
dedicate
gas
to
interstate
service,
he
must
be
able
to
perform
the
service.
gulf
was
never
able
or
at
anytime
to
perform
the
service
of
selling
southland’s
gas
because
gulf
never
owned
any
interest
in
or
had
any
right
or
control
over
the
disposition
of
southland’s
gas.
as
the
court
below
noted,
gulf
in
the
present
case
at
all
times
lacked
the
legal
ability
to
deliver
any
gas
from
southland’s
property
after
the
expiration
of
a
limited
50
year
term.
as
to
gulf’s
willingness
to
dedicate
southland’s
gas,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
realizes
that
gulf’s
assertion
that
it
attempted
no
dedication
of
gas
beyond
the
interest
it
owned,
is
undisputed
on
the
record
in
this
case.
likewise,
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
gulf’s
assertion,
that
it
did
not
purport
to
dedicate
the
gas
to
el
paso
which
it
would
not
own
after
the
expiration
of
its
lease.
according
to
the
record,
gulf
believed
that
any
such
dedication
would
have
been
ineffective
as
a
matter
of
law
to
buying
gas
which
it
had
no
right
to.
i
make
this
point
because
in
the
original
argument,
it
appeared
there
might
be
a
misconception
that
the
record
showed
that
gulf
intended
or
attempted
in
its
contract
with
el
paso
and
in
its
certificate
application
could
dedicate
more
gas
than
it
owned
under
its
50
year
fixed
term
lease,
such
is
not
the
case.the
f
act
that
gulf
applied
for
and
was
issued
a
certificate
of
unlimited
duration
does
not
bear
on
whether
gulf
was
able
or
willing
to
dedicate
southland’s
gas,
that
simply
meant
that
gulf
was
obligated
to
sell
all
the
waddell
ranch
gas
it
owned,
it
did
mean
that
southland
either
sought
or
was
authorized
to
sell
gas
it
did
not
own.
gulf
sought
a
certificate
unlimited
in
time
because
its
contract
with
el
paso
covered
not
only
its
limited
interest
in
waddell
gas
but
also
gas
from
a
number
of
other
sources,
where
the
leases
were
not
for
a
fixed
term
but
for
the
life
of
the
reserves.
as
a
result,
gulf
has
delivered
and
is
today
delivering
very
substantial
quantities
of
gas
from
these
other
sources
to
el
paso
under
this
very
same
contract,
in
fact,
those
volumes
of
gas
are
substantially
in
excess
of
the
volumes
of
gas
involved
in
this
case.
nor
was
southland’s
gas
dedicated
because
the
certificate
issued
to
gulf
pursuant
to
section
7(e)
imposed
a
service
obligation,
separate
and
apart
from
the
sales
obligation
imposed
by
its
contract
with
el
paso.
under
7(e),
the
service
obligation
imposed
by
producer
certificate,
extends
to
what
the
producer
is
able
to
do
but
does
not
extend
to
what
he
is
not
able
to
do.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
the
commission
could
get
permission
to
terminate
what?
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
the
lessee
in
this
case,
gulf
oil
corporation
has
been
required
to
file
an
abandonment
application,
file
such
an
application
more
than
two
years
ago.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
i
do
but
it
is
in
full
compliance
with
section
7(b)
of
the
act—
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
correct
justice
white
because
el
paso,
i
mean
because
gulf's
supply
of
available
gas
has
depleted
to
the
extent
that
continuance
of
service
is
unwarranted,
those
are
the
words
of
section
7(b)
and
that
is
our
position.
in
this
case,
gulf’s
service
obligation
was
limited
to
the
waddell
ranch
gas
it
found
and
produced
during
the
defined
50
year
term
of
its
lease
because
that
was
the
only
gas
gulf
had
any
right
to
sell
and
deliver.
thus
gulf
service
obligation
in
no
way
was
binding
on
southland.
let
me
illustrate
by
saying
that
in
most
instances,
gas
reserves
are
owned
by
a
number
of
different
producers
and
if
one
owner
of
the
gas
reserve
makes
an
interstate
sale
of
his
interest,
his
service
obligation
binds
him
to
deliver
all
the
gas
he
owns
regardless
of
any
limitation
to
this
contract
to
the
contrary.
but
this
service
obligation
is
no
way
binding
on
any
of
the
other
owners,
they
are
free
to
sell
their
interest
in
the
gas
to
the
purchaser
of
their
choice.
we
say
that
is
exactly
the
situation
here.
gulf
made
an
interstate
sale
of
its
interest
in
the
waddell
ranch
gas,
the
service
obligation
it
incurred
under
a
certificate,
obligated
gulf
to
deliver
as
it
has
done
all
over
waddell
ranch
gas
it
owned.
gulf
would
have
had
this
obligation
even
if
it
is
contract
with
el
paso
had
expired
before
the
termination
of
its
fixed
term
lease
but
gulf’s
service
obligation
is
no
way
binding
on
southland’s
entirely
separate
interest
in
the
waddell
ranch
gas
because
gulf
was
never
legally
able
to
undertake
any
service
from
southland’s
gas.
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
several
of
the
points
that
mr.
barnett
made
during
the
course
of
his
opening
presentation.
first,
i
want
to
turn
to
is
the
question
of
reliance
which
he
mentioned
i
believe
also
mr.
deutsch
mentioned.
we
reject
that
claim
entirely
as
the
court
below
noted,
this
claim
of
public
reliance
is
supported
and
i
quote,
by
neither
fact
nor
authority,
none
of
the
commissions
orders
under
review
here
or
based
upon
any
such
alleged
reliance
and
moreover,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
a
claim
of
public
reliance.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
there
is
no
question
there
whether,
there
might
be
a
question
justice
rehnquist
in
my
mind
if
the
congress
could
do
that,
that
it
encompasses
that
congress
could
tell
'a'
he
could
dedicated
'b's
gas
but
aside
from
the
fact,
putting
that
aside,
congress
could
certainly
in
effect
assert
jurisdiction
over
producers
and
lessors.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
correct
and
then
i
think
that
really
gets
back
to
where
we
started
from
and
that
is
what
congress
did
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
whether
the
plain
words
of
the
act
say
when
read
in
the
common
sense
fashion.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
you
mean
the
fact
that
congress
could
assert
this—
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
could
they
amend
the
existing
natural
gas
act?
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
believe
they
could.
i
know
there
are
some
that
take
the
position
to
contrary
but
i
believe
that
a
showing
could
be
made
by
congress—
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
believe
that
also
probably
the
effect
that
the
intrastate
market
has
on
the
interstate
market
would
be
a
basis
for
congress
asserting
jurisdiction
on
that
basis.
i
want
to
point
out
that
southland
did
not
ratify
gulf’s
interstate
dedication
of
gulf’s
gas
to
the
interstate
market
by
accepting
royalties
in
a
opinion,
exhaustive
opinion
more
than
six
years
ago
by
judge
leventhal
of
the
dc
circuit.
he
pointed
out
that
a
royalty
owner
is
not
a
natural
gas
company
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction
because
he
is
a
land
owner
who
simply
enters
into
a
lease
for
the
expiration
development
of
his
land,
if
that
transact
is
clearly
not
a
jurisdictional
one
and
that
likewise
the
royalty
owner
does
not
make
a
sale
of
their
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce
because
he
has
no
control
over
the
sale,
one
way
or
the
other.
the
commission
also
contends
that
southland’s
gas
was
somehow
dedicated
to
interstate
service
in
this
case
because
of
the
continuing
flow
of
gulf’s
gas
could
not
be
interrupted
without
7(b)
abandonment
authorization.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
record
is
unequivocal
and
clear
that
southland
has
never
made
a
sale
of
its
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce
except
under
compulsion
of
the
orders
that
are
under
review.
so
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
southland’s
gas
has
been
flowing
in
interstate
commerce
and
because
of
the
flow,
the
commission
can
assert
a
jurisdiction.
the
basic
policy
though
and
the
commission’s
argument,
if
that
the
only
physical
flow
that
gulf
could
indeed
dedicate
to
interstate
service
was
gulf’s
leasehold
gas,
a
50
year
flow
and
as
this
court
made
clear
in
sunray,
once
gulf’s
gas
commenced
the
flow,
that
supply
could
not
be
withdrawn
from
continued
interstate
movement
without
commission
permission.
of
course,
gulf
did
not
withdraw
that
supply;
instead
gulf
has
delivered
all
of
its
leasehold
gas.
therefore,
gulf
supplied
the
only
supply
which
ever
has
flowed
in
the
interstate
commerce
is
gone
and
in
the
words
of
section
7(b),
it
has
been
depleted
to
the
extent
that
continuance
of
service
is
unwarranted.
as
to
the
basis
for
asserting
jurisdiction
because
of
what
are
essentially
policy
witnesses,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
put
his
finger
on
the
question
about
this
proliferation
of
short
term
leases
if
southland
prevails
in
this
case,
when
he
said
that
clearly,
the
commission
has
the
power
and
can
require
all
of
the
necessary
information
so
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
proposed
sale
involved
such
a
lease
and
if
so
to
take
appropriate
action
to
protect
the
public
interest.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
we
say
that
the
southland
prevails,
there
are
not
going
to
be
any
short
term
leases
because
they
are
not
economically
feasible,
that
many,
many
years
ago
back
in
the
late
1920s,
these
leases
became
extinct
because
producers
are
just
not
going
to
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
or
millions
of
dollars
drilling
wells.
they
will
not
be
able
to
produce
any
gas
they
find
for
two
or
three
years
or
whatever
the
defined
term
is,
but
that
even
if,
it
should
happen
that
there
were
short
term
leases,
the
commission
clearly
has
it
within
its
power
to
requiring
for
regulations
that
a
lessee
shows
the
term
of
his
lease
and
then
the
commission
can
take
such
action
as
it
had
deems
appropriate
to
protect
the
public
interest.
as
the
second
policy—
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
justice
stevens,
the
commission
would
say,
we
are
not
going
to
certificate
this
sale
unless
you
get
the
lessor
to
join.
the
commission
could
say
that
we
are
going
to
just
refuse
the
sale
altogether,
we
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
have
that
or
thirdly,
it
could
condition
the
sale
on
an
unlimited
term
certificate
just
as
the
commission
did
in
sunray.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
this
certificate
yes,
in
this
certificate,
the
service
obligation
that
was
imposed
by
this
certificate
as
i
spoke
to
a
minute
ago,
gulf’s
service
obligation
is
limited
to
gulf’s
ability
to
perform
and
gulf’s
ability
to
perform
here
was
limited
to
its
leasehold
gas
and
under
its
lease,
the
only
gas
that
gulf
was
entitled
to
was
the
gas
it
actually
produced
during
the
specified
50
year
term,
so
that
the
fact
that
gulf
got
an
unlimited
term
certificate
really
made
no
difference,
it
did
not
affect.
in
other
words
southland
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
as
a
second
policy
reason,
the
commission
speculates
that
dedicated
reserves
may
somehow
be
released
from
interstate
commerce
because
of
the
reasoning
or
the
theory
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case.
they
say
that
such
theory
may
be
applied
where
a
lease
or
grants
are
produces
the
right
to
dedicate
gas.
he
dedicates
the
gas
and
then
his
lease
is
prematurely
terminated
before
all
of
a
dedicated
gas
has
been
produced.
they
particularly
refer
to
the
typical
life
of
reserve
lease
which
provides
and
it
will
remain
in
effect,
so
long
as
reserves
are
found
in
paying
quantities.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
fifth
circuit
applies
to
such
a
situation
and
his
opinion
judge
clark
was
very
careful
to
emphasize
that
under
its
lease,
gulf
at
no
time
was
possessed
of
rights
in
the
waddell
ranch
gas.
that
could
extend
beyond
a
50
year
term
of
this
lease.
therefore,
it
is
clear
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
gulf
never,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
never,
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
southland’s
gas.
in
fact,
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
subsequently
distinguished
this
case
when
it
affirmed
orders
of
the
commission
holding
that
gas
of
phillips
petroleum
company
was
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce.
the
commission,
in
fact
in
the
pennzoil
case
mentioned
by
the
commission
counsel
is
going
even
further
and
taken
the
position
that
the
reasoning
in
this
case
actually
supports
the
position,
that
when
a
life
of
reserve
lease
preventively
terminates
the
interstate
dedication
of
reserves
prior
to
such
termination
continues
in
effect.
in
any
event,
when
this
court
is
faced
with
a
case
involving
the
premature
termination
of
a
typical
life
reserve’s
lease,
it
may
well
conclude
that
because
the
producer
under
such
a
lease
had
the
power
to
dedicate
100
percent
of
his
gas
reserves
and
did
so
dedicate
them
before
his
lease
terminated.
any
such
gas
remains
dedicated
despite
the
lease
termination.such
a
holding
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
holding
for
southland
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
all
that
the
court
need
hold
here
and
all
that
we
believe
that
this
circuit
held
is
that
one
who
has
never
had
any
interest
in
or
control
over
gas
cannot
dedicate
that
gas
to
interstate
service.
of
course,
if
there
is
any
question
in
the
court’s
mind
as
to
the
extent
of
the
decision
below,
it
can
and
should
limit
it.
the
issue
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
which
is
whether
one
who
never
had
an
interest
in
or
control
over
gas
can
dedicate
that
gas
to
interstate
service.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
with
that
of
course,
of
course
it
is
our
position
that
the
act
that
say
that.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
but
i
believe
as
long
as
the—
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
think
that,
that
is
probably
right
because
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
it
now
stands,
the
commission
cannot
force
someone
to
sell
their
own
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
he
said,
the
lessee
says
that
the
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
but
you
are
saying
that
the
act
is
also
amended
to
provide
that
when
the
lessee
makes
the
sale.
well,
of
course
if
the
lease
was
entered
into
it
at
the
time
that
he
had
noticed
then
it
might
be
a
different
--
they
it
can
be
by
consent.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
would
say
but
he
would
have
to
be
given
his
implied
consent
in
that
instance.
but
of
course
in
this
instance
we
have
no
notice,
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
but
the
lessor
is;
by
entering
into
the
lease
with
knowledge
of
the
law
as
it
is
giving
his
implied
consent
to
the
lessee,
to
sell
his
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
it
is
kind
of
an
agency
argument
in
other
words,
and
we
do
not
have
that
here,
justice
white.
i
believe
that
this
morning
or
this
afternoon,
the
government
said
that
they
are
not
relying
on
any
type
of
agency
concept.
i
do
want
to
mention
two
other
points
that
mr.
barnett
brought
up.
first,
he
read
from
a
part
of
the
brief
we
filed
with
the
commission
as
to
once
gas
are
being
dedicated,
it
remains
dedicated
but
he
quit
there
because
the
next
sentence
says,
but
this
legal
conclusion
begs
the
question
of
whether
gas
attributable
to
the
interest
of
the
mineral
estate
or
mineral
interest
owners
has
been
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
and
then
we
went
on
to
answer
another
question
that
was
asked
this
morning
and
that
is
the
effect
of
this
court’s
decision
in
california
versus
lo-vaca.
we
said
that
the
reliance
on
that
decision
is
totally
misplaced
because
there
has
been
no
physical
movement
of
any
gas
attributable
to
our
mineral
estate.
the
question
was
asked
of
mr.
barnett,
could
southland
have
come
in
and
blocked
tin
effect
gulf's
certificate
application,
of
course
southland
had
no
idea
that
it
would
ever
be
claimed
that
gulf
was
attempting
to
dedicate
southland’s
gas.
but
in
any
event,
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
the
commission
told
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
quote
that
southland
royalty
could
not
prevent
gulf’s
total
dedication
of
surplus
residue
gas
to
el
paso.
as
to
the
commission’s
analogy
to
an
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land,
we
find
that
unusual,
that
analogy
does
not
benefit
them
under
common
law,
a
covenant
is
not
binding
on
anyone
who
is
not
a
successor
to
the
covenanter
and
in
this
case
the
decision
of
the
texas
supreme
court
in
1973,
made
it
crystal
clear
that
southland
had
a
separate
independent
state
that
was
vested
at
all
times
and
that
southland
is
in
no
way
a
successor
to
gulf.
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
that
we
think
that
this
case
is
based
on
two
basic
principles
still
and
that
is
one,
that
you
cannot
dedicate
what
you
do
not
own
and
two,
that
gulf
oil
never
owned
any
interest
in
southland’s
gas,
never
had
any
right
in
that
gas,
had
never
had
any
control
over
it
and
that
therefore,
southland’s
gas
was
not
dedicated
to
intestate
service
when
gulf
made
an
interstate
service
of
gulf’s
gas,
for
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
you
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
