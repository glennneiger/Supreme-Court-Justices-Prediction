justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
a
convict
commission
could
have
required
the
consent
of
southland
at
the
time
that
it
issued
the
original
certificate,
could
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
it
said,
we
see
you
have
just
got
a
50-year
lease
and
we
think
we
may
want
service
furnished
beyond
that,
if
they
can
require
this
application
by
southland
to
a
company
that
of
gulf
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
the
commission
not,
in
its
proceedings
on
the
application,
ask
the
necessary
questions
and
develop
the
necessary
information
to
find
out
how
long
the
lease
is
of
the
natural
gas
company
and
if
there
are
reversionary
interests,
required
that
the
owners’
reversionary
interest
join
in
the
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
anybody
--
you
can
not
say
gulf
in
my
example
is
authorized
by
anybody,
the
land
owner
has
determined
that
gulf
does
not
hold
the
lease
but
some
other
company
holds
the
lease
and
is
the
owner
and
has
the
right
to
dedicate
the
task.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
service
could
be
discontinued?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
must
say
then
that
southland
here
implicitly
authorized
the
dedication?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
the
theory
the
commission
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
certainly
did
not
use
the
theory
that
southland
is
a
gas
company,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
what
has
the
natural
gas
act
said
on
its
face,
what
i
just
indicated?
you
would
not
be
here,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
preempt
it,
the
gas
act
just
says,
let
us
suppose
it
just
said
on
his
face
that
when
a
lessor
is
to
give
leases,
lessees
have
the
power
to
dedicate
permanently
all
of
the
gas.
that
is
just
like
a
provision…
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
effect
the
commission
is
construing
the
natural
gas
act
and
to
say
that
when
a
lessee
dedicates,
you
can
dedicate
the
entire
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
has
a
potential
using
it
all
on
50
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
physically
possible
that
by
the
end
of
50
years
there
would
not
be
any
more
in
oil
and
gas
in
that
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
if
that
were
a
remote
possibility
gulf
might
have
used
it
all
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
it
was
free
to
take
out
within
50
years
of
that
lease
that
it
dedicated
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
saying
that,
suppose
the
commission
had
run
through
a
rule-making
proceeding
and
made
this
supplemental
piece
of
legislation
and
put
out
a
regulation
that
this
is
the
way
leases
will
be
construed
or
applied,
or
this
is
what
the
natural
gas
act
means,
or
at
least
this
is
the
regulation.
i
supposed
you
would
be
arguing
here
from
what
you
just
said
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
natural
gas
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
in
asking
this
question,
i
am
not
assuming
that
the
commission
was
correct
or
that
it
is
legally
correct
but
i
am
asking
you
this.
was
it
foreseeable,
that
the
commission
was
going
to
rule
this
way?
is
this
the
first
time
it
ever
ruled
this
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
not
overrule,
it
did
not
overrule
any
prior
decisions
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
there
is
interesting
language
in
the
sunray.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
even
if
the
commission
were
right,
it
might
not
have
been,
legally,
it
might
not
have
been
foreseeable.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
if
we
disagreed
with
you
legally
and
said
the
commission
had
the
power
to
do
this,
i
am
sure
you
would
say,
“we
think
you
are
wrong
but
even
if
we
have
to
live
with
your
rule,
mr.
court,
you
should
not
apply
it
retroactively.”
justice
byron
r.
white
the
gas
act
did
so
provide
that,
i
suppose,
did
it
not
expressly?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
says
if
it
so
provides
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
more
so
than
what
the
commission
says
and
the
commission
says
in
that,
that
when
you
dedicate
under
a
lease,
you
have
dedicated
all
the
gas.
that
is
the
way
they
construe
the
act.
so,
if
you
have
constitutional
issues,
if
the
act
expressly
said,
they
are
constitutionally
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
lessor
and
the
lessee
prior
to
the
50
years
could
just
together
terminate
the
lease,
agree
to
terminate
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
getting
the
commission’s
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
gas
had
run
out
in
the
40
years,
technically,
i
suppose
the
commission
could
require
an
abandonment
proceeding
and
why
would
that
not
satisfy
your
concerns,
mr.
attorney
general,
if
a
lessee
at
the
end
of
his
lease
had
to
file
his
petition
for
an
abandonment
but
if
the
facts
are
as
he
alleged,
the
commission
would
have
to
grant
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
i
just
wanted
to
know
does
that
satisfy
your
concerns
if
the
rule
was
he
had
to
file
but
the
commission
would
have
to
grant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hill,
your
colleague,
br.
barnett
said
that
in
that
example
that
you
reviewed,
the
one
i
gave
him,
he
thought
the
commission
would
have
to
grant
the
abandonment
under
the
commission’s
rule,
in
the
anb
case
and
the
one
you
just
reviewed.
he
thought
the
commission
would
have
to
grant
the
abandonment
although
they
would…
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
the
commission
is
not
agreeing
with
my
suggestion,
would
not
be
agreeing
with
my
suggestion
but
i
am
wondering
if
it
would
satisfy
your
concern.
if
the
lessee
had
to
file
for
abandonment
at
the
end
of
his
lease
term
but
the
commission
had
to
grant
it,
if
unless
there
were
some
hanky-panky
or
some
strange
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commission
was
required
to
grant
the
abandonment.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
once
they
had
consented
to
the
abandonment,
future
gas
is
free
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
my
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
has
to
be
a
filing
for
an
abandonment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suggest,
you
suggest,
just
a
matter
law
that
the
federal
law
that
says
to
a
lessee
and
and
to
his
lessor
that
if
you
are
going
to
get
in
the
interstate
market,
you
are
in
until
we
let
you
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
and,
so
when
the
lease
expires,
you
do
not,
you
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
lease
expires?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
lease
expires,
the
lessor
is
still
stuck
in
the
interstate
market
because
that
was
the
rule
on
the
first
place,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
lease,
if
there
was
a
clause
in
the
lease
that
you
cannot
sell
this
gas
in
the
interstate
market,
would
the
commission
let
it
be,
with
a
certificate
issued
for
the
interstate
market
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
certainly,
it
must
be
the
leasers
have
filed
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
do
not
they;
when
they
apply
for
the
certificate;
they
must
make
some
representations
about—
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
legally,
it
is
as
though
it
was
a
joint,
a
joint
application
for
a
certificate
from
the
lessor
and
the
lessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that,
is
that
duty
you
speak
of,
to
sell
in
the
interstate
market,
is
that
a
texas
law
proposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
you
insist
that
the
lessee
had
the
authority
to
sell
in
the
interstate
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
he
has
to
employ
the,
lessor
has
to
put
up
with
the
prices
and
i
guess,
that
the
interstate
market
sets
or
that
commission
sets
for
the
interstate
market
and
his
royalties
are
figured
on
that
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
lessee
authorized
to
sell
in
the
interstate
market
under
the
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
were
there
any
rules
in
the
governing
any,
any
official
or
unofficial
rules
governing
the
interstate
market,
the
lessee
was
not
authorized
to
live
up
to.
i
suppose
he
would
have
to
live
up
to
the
prices
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
authorized
to
sell
them
interstate
market—
justice
byron
r.
white
and
sooner
or
later
there
came
to
be
a
regime
of
law
that
governed
the
interstate
market
including
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
lessee
was
supposed
to
live
up
to
them,
i
suppose?
he
was
not
breaching
his
lease
by
doing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
of
these
leases
a
percentage
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
commission
could
make
gulf
get
permission
to
terminate?
let
us
forget
about
southland.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
lessee
be
required
to
get
permission
to
terminate
at
the
end
of
the
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do,
do
you
think
the
commission
was
within
its
powers
in
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
say
it
would
be
just
a
pro
forma,
the
commission
would
be
obligated
to
give
permission.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
natural
gas
act
said
on
its
face
that
when
any
gas
is
dedicated
by
a
lessee,
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
entire
gas
supply
is
dedicated
to
the
interstate
market,
unless
there
is
consent
of
the
commission
so
that
the--
suppose
the
gas
act
said
that
now
and
tomorrow
a
lease
has
entered
into
and
a
lessee
dedicates
gas,
you
think
you
could
buy
in
the
lessor
in
a
matter
like
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
responding
to
your
general
statement
that
the
lessee
could
never
have
authority
to
dedicate
gas,
that
it
does
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lessee
comes
in
now
and
says
that
i
want
to
dedicate,
and
the
law
on
its
face
says
that,
this
will
be
taken
as
so
and
so,
and
the
lessor
has
authorized
him
to
sell
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lease
says
on
its
face
that
he
can
sell
it
anywhere
he
wants
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
the
lessor
had
noticed
of
the
law
and
what
the
law
once
he
entered
into
the
lease,
and
so
is
he
bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lessee
then
is
giving
a
--
the
lessee
is
then
dedicating
gas
in
which
he
has
no
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
three
cases,
the
california
against
southland,
and
two
consolidated
cases
raise
issues
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act.
under
that
section,
the
consent
of
the
commission,
now
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
is
required
for
the
abandonment
of
any
service
rendered
by
certificated
facilities
carrying
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
upon
the
termination
of
the
lease,
under
which
the
lessee
has
made
a
certificated
sales
in
interstate
commerce,
the
lessor
must
secure
the
consent
of
the
commission
to
terminate
the
interstate
sales.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said
or
held
that
the
commission
had
no
power
at
all
in
these
circumstances.
we
disagree
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
as
we
see
it,
section
7
does
reach
a
situation
such
as
this
under
consent
of
the
commission
must
be
obtained.
this
result
we
think
is
required
by
our
cases,
particularly
sunray
mid-continent
oil
company
case
in
364
u.s.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens

dissenting
opinion,

justice,
