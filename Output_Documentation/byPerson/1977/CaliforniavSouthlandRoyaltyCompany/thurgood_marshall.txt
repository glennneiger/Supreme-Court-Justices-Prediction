did
not
process
either.
justice

process,
is
it
not
pretty
odd
on
the
gas
company
that
does
not
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
difficult
to
have
a
gas
company
if
the
company
does
not
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
i
understood
the
government
to
say
that
they
were
trying
to
do
just
what
you
are
talking
about,
that
the
energy
commission
was
trying
to
do
just
what
you
say
they
are
not
doing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
that
the
energy
commission
is
having
pressure
put
on
them
to
stop
them
from
doing
what
you
want
them
to
do?is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
criticizing
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
your
argument
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is,
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
legal
arguments
you
have
other
than
policy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
kinds
of
interpretation
on
this
one
section.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
do
not
understand
is
why
the
original
agreement
with
gulf,
the
original
dedication
did
not
say
specifically
that
we
had
dedicated
only
the
gas
that
we
have
control
over.
would
that
have
been
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
lease
did
say
the
fifth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
those
leases
ran
out,
that
dedication
ran
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
lease?
could
gulf
not
say
i
will
dedicate
all
of
the
oil
that
i
will
get
under
my
50-year
lease
with
the
waddell
ranch?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
they
did
not
have
any
gas,
that
gulf
did
not
have
any.
