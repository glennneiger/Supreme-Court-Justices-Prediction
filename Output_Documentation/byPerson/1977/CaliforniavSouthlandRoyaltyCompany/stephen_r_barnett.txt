mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
cases
involve
oil
and
gas
leases
and
the
extent
of
the
authority
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
formerly
the
federal
power
commission
under
section
7d
of
the
natural
gas
act.
section
7d
as
set
out
on
the
appendix
to
our
brief
provides,
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
in
full
since
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
this
case:“no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
oil
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities,
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
or
any
service
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities.
without
the
permission
and
approval
of
the
commission
first
had
and
obtained
after
due
hearing,
and
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
available
supply
of
natural
gas
is
depleted
to
the
extent
that
the
continuance
of
service
is
unwarranted
or
that
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
or
necessity
permits
such
abandonment.
”in
these
cases,
a
gas
producer
had
leased
gas
producing
property
under
a
50-year
lease
and
had
sold
gas
from
that
property
in
interstate
commerce,
pursuant
to
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
by
the
commission
without
limit
of
time.
the
question
presented
in
the
case
is
whether,
when
the
50-year
term
of
the
lease
expires,
the
process
of
supplying
gas
from
that
property
to
interstate
commerce
may
be
terminated
and
the
gas
produced
from
those
reserves
sold
in
intrastate
commerce
instead
without
a
requirement
that
either
the
lessee
or
the
lessor
obtain
abandonment
authorization
from
the
commission
pursuant
to
section
7d
of
the
act.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated.
in
1925,
gulf
oil
corporation
obtained
an
oil
and
gas
lease
from
the
owners
of
the
waddell
ranch
in
crane
county
in
west
texas,
part
of
the
permian
basin.
the
lease
gave
gulf
the
exclusive
right
to
explore
for
oil
and
gas
on
the
waddell
ranch
and
to
produce
and
market
all
the
oil
and
gas
it
might
find
there
for
the
fixed
term
of
50
years.
the
lease
provided
that
the
owners
of
the
waddell
ranch,
the
lessors
would
receive
a
royalty
from
gulf
based
on
the
quantity
of
natural
gas
produced
and
the
number
of
producing
wells.
a
year
later
in
1926,
the
owners
of
the
waddell
ranch
conveyed
one
half
of
their
mineral
fee
interest
to
southland
royalty
company,
one
of
respondents
here.
other
shares
in
the
mineral
interest
under
the
waddell
ranch
were
subsequently
conveyed
to
a
number
of
other
owners.
at
present,
the
record
discloses
that
southland
owns
47
percent,
trustees
under
the
will
of
warren
right
own
26
percent,
the
exxon
corporation
owns
14
percent
and
there
are
more
than
one
hundred
other
owners.
i
will
refer
at
times
to
all
those
owners
collectively
as
southland.
in
1951,
gulf
entered
into
a
contract
with
el
paso
natural
gas
company
and
interstate
pipeline,
whereby
gulf
agreed
to
sell
to
el
paso
surplus
residue
gas.
that
is
a
portion
of
the
casing
head
gas
which
comes
from
oil
wells
as
distinguished
from
gas
well
gas.
gulf
agreed
to
sell
to
el
paso’s
surplus
residue
gas
from
the
waddell
lease
and
from
other
sources.
in
1954,
after
this
court’s
decision
in
the
phillips
case,
gulf
applied
to
the
federal
power
commission,
as
it
then
was,
for
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
under
section
7e
of
the
natural
gas
act,
authorizing
it
to
make
the
sale
to
el
paso
and
this
certificate
was
granted
by
the
commission
in
1956.
either
the
application
for
the
certificate
nor
the
certificate
itself
provided
for
any
limit
of
time
on
the
sales
or
service
being
authorized.
in
1972,
gulf
entered
into
a
second
similar
contract
with
el
paso
for
the
sale
of
gas
coming
from
the
waddell
lease
and
other
sources.gulf
again
applied
for
a
certificate
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
again
got
it
in
1973.
on
july
14,
1975,
the
50-year
term
of
the
waddell
lease
came
to
an
end
and
the
lease
expired
and
title
to
the
mineral
estate
in
the
waddell
ranch
thus,
reverted
to
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners
-
southland,
et
all.
meanwhile,
there
is
also,
in
this
case
the
goldsmith
lease.
also
in
1925,
gulf
entered
into
a
similar
50-year
fixed
term
oil
and
gas
lease
with
goldsmith
and
others
on
the
goldsmith
ranch
in
ector
county,
texas,
also
west
texas.
the
owners
of
the
goldsmith
ranch
subsequently
conveyed
their
mineral
interest
to
others
including
the
same
southland
royalty
company,
and
including
texaco
inc.
which
now
owns
one-fourth
of
the
interest.
gulf
sold
gas
from
the
goldsmith
lease
to
phillips
petroleum
company
which
processed
that
gas
and
sold
it
to
el
paso
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce,
pursuant
to
certificates
that
the
commission
granted
to
el
paso.
in
1975,
of
course,
the
goldsmith
lease
also
expired
and
title
to
the
mineral
estate
reverted
to
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
the
parties
had
agreed
that
the
waddell
lease
and
the
goldsmith
lease,
the
waddell
ranch
and
the
goldsmith
ranch,
and
all
the
legal
ramifications
of
each
have
no
legal
differences.
and
thus,
i
will
adapt
the
practice
followed
by
southland
in
its
brief
and
refer
at
least
sometimes
to
both
leases
and
terms
of
the
waddell
lease.
i
will
always
refer
to
the
lessee
as
gulf,
although
in
fact
there
are
some
other
minor
lessees,
and
i
will
sometimes
refer
to
the
owners
of
the
reversionary
mineral
interests
simply
as
southland.
now,
the
proceedings
before
the
commission…
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
plan
to
get
to
that,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
in
short
i
think
they
both
are
but
i
will
expound
on
that
a
little
more
fully
in
a
moment,
if
you
like.
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
were
as
follows:
shortly
before
the
end
of
the
waddell
lease
period
in
1975,
southland
entered
into
a
contract
with
intratex
gas
company
and
intrastate
gas
pipeline
in
texas,
whereby
southland
agreed
to
sell
to
intratex
on
the
unregulated
intrastate
market
gas
from
the
waddell
lease
after
the
lease
expired.
needless
to
say,
the
intrastate
price
-
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about
of
course
-
the
intrastate
price
is
significantly
higher
than
the
interstate
price
regulated
by
the
commission,
at
which
the
gas
was
being
sold
to
el
paso.
in
january
1975,
having
heard
that
southland
was
soliciting
proposals
for
intrastate
sales
of
its
gas,
el
paso
petitioned
the
commission
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
as
to
whether
when
the
waddell
lease
expired,
southland
and
the
other
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners
would
be
entitled
to
terminate
the
deliveries
of
waddell
ranch
gas
to
el
paso
and
sell
the
gas
instead
on
the
intrastate
market
without
getting
the
commission’s
approval
under
section
7b.
texaco
as
one-fourth
owner
of
the
reversionary
estate
in
the
goldsmith
ranch
filed
a
similar
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
before
the
commission.
since
the
cases
were
so
similar,
the
commission
consolidated
the
two
proceedings
since
there
were
no
issues
or
fact,
no
evidentiary
hearings
were
sought
or
held
various
parties
intervened
before
the
commission.
the
commission
issued
its
decision
in
july
1975.
it
held
that
the
various
mineral
interest
reversioners
may
not
sell
gas
from
the
reserves
underlying
the
waddell
and
goldsmith
ranches
in
intrastate
commerce
without
first
obtaining
abandonment
authorization
from
the
commission.
because
the
commission
held
that
gas
had
been
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
by
the
certificate
of
sales
that
the
lessees
had
made
to
el
paso.
the
commission
reasoned
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
dedication
involved
is
not
the
dedication
of
an
individual
party
or
producer
but
the
dedication
of
gas
and
that
once
the
service
of
supplying
gas
in
interstate
commerce
from
specific
acreage
has
commenced,
quoting
this
court’s
decisions
in
catco
and
sunray
“there
can
be
no
withdrawal
of
that
supply
from
continued
interstate
movement
without
commission
approval.”
the
commission
said,
“this
does
not
mean
that
we
are
modifying
the
law
of
texas
as
to
the
leasehold
rights;
we
are
however
recognizing
rights
and
duties
that
have
been
created
by
the
congress
under
the
natural
gas
act.”
the
commission
therefore
held
-
and
this
relates
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens
-
that
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners
and
also
gulf
were
required
to
obtain
abandonment
authority
under
section
7
before
ceasing
the
interstate
sales.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
answers
your
question;i
propose
to
try
to
do
so
in
a
minute.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
correct.
the
commission’s
theory
was
that
it
is
a
dedication
of
gas,
not
a
dedication
of
any
particular
person.
as
it
has
otherwise
been
put,
it
is
an
in
rem
rather
than
in
personam
concept,
the
gas
is
dedicated.
i
will
return
to
some
of
the
ramifications
of
that.
on
petition
for
rehearing
the
commission
essentially
adhered,
the
commission
did
adhere
to
its
findings
and
conclusions,
although
adding
some
supplementary
reasoning
that
i
think
i
need
not
recite.
southland
and
the
other
reversionary
interest
owners
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
reversed
the
commission’s
orders.
the
court
viewed
the
issue
of
interstate
dedication
as
controlled
by
local
texas
law,
noting
that,
“under
applicable
texas
law,
gulf’s
rights
were
those
of
a
tenant
for
a
term
of
years.
its
interest
was
a
limited
one
which
terminated
completely
when
title
reverted
to
southland
at
the
expiration
of
the
50-year
term”.
thus,
“under
well-established
concepts
of
property
law,
gulf
could
not
legally
deal
in,
or
dedicate
that
portion
of
the
gas
which
southland
might
own
upon
termination
of
gulf’s
estate.
the
court
reiterated
that
under
texas
law,
gulf’s
50-year
lease
interest
did
not
authorize
it
to
impose
any
limitation
on
the
reversionary
estate,
and
that
under
texas
property
law,
gulf
could
not
bind
the
reversionary
estate
by
its
actions.
the
court
thus
concluded
that
by
virtue
of
local
law,
the
reversioners
were
free
to
cease
the
service
to
el
paso
and
its
interstate
customers
and
to
sell
the
gas
from
these
reserves
in
intrastate
commerce
after
expiration
of
the
lease.
petitions
for
certiorari
were
filed
in
this
court
by
the
commission
and
also
by
el
paso
in
the
state
of
california,
the
court
granted
the
petitions
and
consolidated
the
cases.
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
submit
that
the
case
is
controlled
by
the
plain
language
of
section
7b.
that
language
provides,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
or
any
service
rendered
by
means
of
such
facilities
without
first
obtaining
abandonment
authorization
from
the
commission.”
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
do
not
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,i
would
say
the
key
word
is
service.
it
is
clear
here
that
what
el
paso
was
doing
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
that
was
a
service
indeed
and
i
do
not
take
it
to
be
denied
by
our
opponents
that
el
paso
was
performing
as
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
within
the
language
of
section
7b.
they
do,
i
assume,
raise
the
question…
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
did
i
say
el
paso?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
should
have
said
gulf.
i
am
sorry,
thank
you.
i
do
not
take
it,
i
think
it
could
not
be
denied,
and
it
is
not
denied
that
gulf
was
performing
a
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
by
the
sales
it
was
making
to
el
paso
under
the
lease.
given
that
service,
and
the
court
has
emphasized
in
the
sunray
case,
the
importance
of
the
service
concept
under
section
7b.
the
court
there
said
that
it
is
a
service,
not
just
a
sale
that
the
commission
authorizes
when
it
grants
a
certificate
under
section
7e.
in
the
language,
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
11,
“it
is
evident
that
all
that
matters
for
which
a
certificate
is
required
must
be
justified
in
terms
of
a
service
to
which
they
relate.”
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
all
or
any
portion
of
its
facilities
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
or
any…”
well,
i
think
gulf’s
facilities
clearly
worked.
gulf
had
processing
plants,
it
had
pipeline
connections
with
el
paso
and
with
these
gas
wells.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
well
let
me
know,
this
brings
me
now
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
have
just
argued
that
it
would
seem
clear
here
and
i
would
think
not
denied,
that
gulf
was
performing
a
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
however,
it
might
be
argued
and
our
opponents
apparently
do
argue
that
you
also
have
to
have
a
natural
gas
company
on
the
premises.
that
7b
says,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon”
and
southland
at
least
argues
that
it
is
not
a
natural
gas
company
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and,
thus,
i
come
to
the
question
you
raised
earlier
and
i
think
there
are
several
answers.
one
is
that
gulf
is
a
natural
gas
company,
clearly
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
the
commission
in
its
certificate
granted
to
gulf
for
the
sales
specifically
held
that
the
applicant
is
a
natural
gas
company.
moreover,
i
take
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
the
commission
held
in
its
order
here
that
neither
gulf
nor
southland
may
abandon
the
service
without
commission
authority.
to
that
extent,
that
means
gulf
must
continue
to
provide
the
gas,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true.
gulf
and
southland
might
have
a
course
of
action
between
each
other,
but
for
purposes
of
the
regulatory
purposes
of
the
natural
gas
act,
gulf
having
been
performing
this
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
act
was
held
not
to
be
able
to
abandon
it.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
it
might
be
obligated
to
go
to
the
commission
and
seek
abandonment
and
i
assume
the
commission
would
grant
it
if
the
oil
wells
ran
out.
but
in
any
event,
that
is
a
different
case,
because
here
you
have
a
continually
flowing
stream
which
did
not
run
out,
which
is
being
stopped
and
diverted
to
intrastate
commerce
and
the
commission
held,
this
is
at
page
608
of
the
appendix,
with
respect
to
holding
that
gulf
must
seek
abandonment
as
well
as
the
reversioners.
in
our
opinion,
this
is
not
a
mere
technical
requirement,
but
would
allow
us
to
pacify
on
the
merits
of
the
lessee’s
abandonments
upon
the
termination
of
the
50-year
leases,
as
well
as
the
proposed
abandonment
of
the
reversioners.
but
i
do
not
take
the
position,
mr.
justice
stevens,that
that
is
the
only
answer
to
the
question.
well,
we
do
submit
that
gulf
is
a
natural
gas
company
for
the
purpose
of
having
to
go
to
the
commission
before
abandoning
this
particular
service,
we
also
submit
that
southland
is
a
natural
gas
company
for
this
purpose.
now
southland
says,
“we
are
not
a
natural
gas
company
because
we
were
not
engaged
in
selling
gas
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction,
we
were
just
receiving
royalties.”
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
southland
did
not
process
either,
that
is
true.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
excuse
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
would
not
assert
that
they
are
a
gas
company
here
because
they
did
not
process.
i
would
assert
they
are
a
natural
gas
company
here
because
they
are
the
party
who
now
controls
a
service
in
natural
gas
which
is
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
and
which
section
7b
says,
“may
not
be
abandoned
without
the
commission’s
approval.”
it
would
be
an
anomalous
and
wholly
self-destructive
interpretation
of
section
7b,
i
submit,
to
read
it
to
say
that
even
though
you
have
a
service,
which
section
7b
says,
“may
not
be
abandoned
without
the
commission’s
approval,”
still
the
party
who
controls
that
service
happens
not
to
be
a
natural
gas
company
and
therefore,
there
is
no
way
that
the
commission
can
effectuate
the
result
that
section
7b
commands.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
at
the
time
it
issued
the
certificate,
gulf
could
have
required
the
consent
of
southland
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
certificate
provided
for
no
limit
of
time,
the
application
provided
for
no
limit
of
time.
by
the
same
token
southland
could
have
written
in
to
its
contract
with
gulf,
its
lease
with
gulf
that
if
you
go
apply
for
a
certificate,
you
make
clear
that
you
are
only
applying
a
50-year
certificate.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
it
perhaps
could
do
that
in
the
future.
in
this
case,
the
application
was
for
an
unlimited
certificate,
the
commission
may
well
have
assumed
on
the
basis
of
cases
like
sunray
that
the
certificate
is
unlimited
when
it
says,
it
is
unlimited
and
that
just
as
a
contract
of
20
years
was
held
in
sunray,
not
to
limit
the
term
of
the
dedication,
so,
the
lease
here
does
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no.
i
would
think
on
those
facts
the
commission
would
grant
the
termination
and
substitute
whoever
the
court
had
found
to
be
the
actual
lessee.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
if
you
were
suggesting
that
gulf’s
application
to
the
commission
on
your
facts
was
wholly
unauthorized,gulf
was
a
sort
of
squatter
on
the
land
and
had
no
authority--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
think
in
that
case,
the
commission
might
find
that
the
original
dedication
was
not
authorized
by
the
land
owner
and
in
that
case
might
set
aside
the
original
dedication.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
where
there
has
once
been
a
dedication
of
a
stream
of
gas,
and
authorized
dedication
anyway
of
a
stream
of
gas….
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
why
i
said
an
authorized
dedication
and
in
that
case,
there
would
not
have
been
an
authorized
dedication
in
the
first
place
and
that
the
–
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
you
might
well
have
to
go
to
the
commission
to
do
so
but
i
should
think
that
on
those
facts
the
commission
would
find
that
since
there
had
been
no
authorized
sale
or
service
in
the
first
place,
the
application
was
fraudulent
in
a
sense.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
i
would
say,
implicitly
by
virtue
of
what
its
authorized
lessee
did.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
in
the
sense,
yes
i
think
the
commission’s
theory
is
that
this
gas
was
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
by
the
sales
and
service
which
gulf
performed
pursuant
to
the
commission
certificate.
everything
gulf
did
was
not
only
normal
but
proper
and
required
of
it
under
its
lease.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
the
commission
did
not
specifically
address
the
question
of
who
is
a
natural
gas
company
and
why,
it
held
that
southland
and
gulf
both
are
for
the
purposes
of
having
to
come
to
the
commission
to
get
abandonment
authority
and
i
would
submit
as
i
already
have
that
gulf
clearly
is.
i
think
southland
also
is
by
virtue
of
controlling
the
service.
in
the
united
gas
pipeline
case
a
few
years
ago,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
question.
in
that
case,
a
producer
did
not
want
to
buy
any
more
gas
from
a
particular
field
and
the
court
held
that
his
refusal
to
keep
purchasing
was
an
abandonment,
ordered
him
to
keep
purchasing
and
the
objection
was
made
where
does
this
court
get
the
authority
to
order
a
purchase.
and
the
court
answered,
where
it
is
necessary
to
regulate
the
purchase
of
gas
in
some
respects
to
carry
out
its
expressly
granted
authority
over
transportation
in
sale,
the
commission
must
have
the
power
to
do
so.
undoubtedly,
the
continued
purchase
of
gas
has
been
ordered
but
only
as
an
incident
to
regulating
transportation
in
sales.
similarly

pipeline

v.
fcc

cited
in
el
paso’s
brief
at
page
29.
similarly
here,
in
order
to
effectuate
its
jurisdiction
over
the
service
that
does
exist,
the
commission,
if
necessary,
would
have
to
be
able
to
assert
personal
jurisdiction
over
southland
to
hold
the
abandonment
proceeding.
but
as
i
have
said,
gulf
also
is
a
natural
gas
company.
as
yet
a
third
point
on
this,
it
should
be
noted
how
carefully
southland
qualifies
its
statement
in
its
brief
at
page
16,
that
it
“has
not
at
anytime
been
a
natural
gas
company
with
respect
to
its
waddell
ranch
gas.”
well
now
some
of
the
reversioners
here
clearly
are
natural
gas
companies
with
respect
to
other
gas.
texaco
is
and
concedes
so
in
the
record
at
appendix
page
218.
exxon,
which
owns
14
percent
of
the
waddell
interest
is
and
concedes
so
in
the
record
of
page
443.
although
it
is
not
in
the
record,
it
is
implied
by
southland’s
statement
which
i
just
read
and
i
am
informed
that
southland
is
also
a
natural
gas
company,
that
is,
does
sell
gas
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
commission
certificates
with
respect
to
other
gas.
that
would
make
more
than
50
percent
of
the
more
than
60
percent
of
the
owners
of
the
waddell
ranch
who
are
natural
gas
companies.
now
if
the
argument
is
that
the
natural
gas
company
requirement
under
section
7b
is
a
separate
requirement
from
the
requirement
of
having
a
service
subject
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
the
natural
gas
company
has
to
be
one
with
respect
to
this
gas.
on
that
basis,
too,
you
have
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no
natural
gas
company
shall
abandon
all
or
any
of
its
facilities.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
but
it
is
the
service,
the
lessee
here—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
such
facilities
could
mean
facilities
subject
to
the
commission
of
the
jurisdiction,
that
is,
gulf’s
facilities
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
do
not
think
it
has
to
be
read
that
way.i
think
gulf’s
facilities
here
were
rendering
the
service
and
the
natural
gas
company
could
be
one
separately.
but
i
think
the
strongest—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference.
i
think
the
shortest
and
easiest
answer
is
that
once
you
come
into
control
of
jurisdictional
service
and
you
are
the
only
party
who
has
the
power
to
abandon
or
continue
that
service,
you
are
by
virtue
of
that
control
a
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
it
is
not
the
central
argument
by
any
means.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
would
not
say
that.
i
think
it
has
some
weight
especially
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
reversioners
that
they
are
just
land
owners,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
natural
gas
business
and
why
should
they
be
subjected
to
any
duties
under
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not
say
that
is
the
commission
indicated
that
southland
should
be
held
to
have
dedicated
the
gas.
the
commission
found
that
the
gas
was
dedicated
by
what
gulf
did
within
the
terms
of
its
lease.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
gulf
had
that
authority
by
virtue
of
its
lease
from
southland.
that
lease
authorized
it
to
take
all
the
gas
it
could
out
of
the
land.
pursuant
to
that
lease,
it
applied
for
and
got
a
certificate
without
limit
of
time.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
that
would
be
a
different
case,
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
gulf
has
in
any
way
breached
its
lease
with
southland.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
for
the
present.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
court
will
recall,
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
oil
and
gas
lease,
actually
two
of
them
but
i
think
they
can
be
reduced
to
one
for
purposes
of
the
argument.
a
lease
running
for
a
term
of
50
years
to
the
mineral
estate
underlying
the
waddell
ranch
in
west
texas,
where
the
lessee,
gulf
was
selling
the
gas
from
the
reserves
under
the
waddell
ranch
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
granted
by
the
commission.
the
question
presented
is
whether
when
the
50
year
lease
expires,
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
requires
the
lessors,
southland
royalty
and
others,
that
is
the
holders
of
the
reversionary
interest
in
the
mineral
estate
to
obtain
abandonment
authority
from
the
commission
before
they
may
stop
that
service
of
interstate,
may
stop
that
service
of
supplying
gas
to
interstate
commerce
and
divert
that
flow
of
gas
instead
to
the
intrastate
market.
now,
first
i
would
like
to
explain
why
we
take
the
position
that
what
is
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
here
and
hence
cannot
be
abandoned
without
the
commission’s
approval
under
section
7(b),
is
the
service
of
supplying
gas
to
the
interstate
market
from
these
reserves
underlying
the
waddell
ranch,
the
reserves
from
which
the
gas
was
continuing
to
flow
to
the
interstate
market,
at
the
moment
that
the
lease
expired.
now,
respondents
brief
throughout
their
brief
and
my
colleague
mr.
attwell
spoke
throughout
his
argument
last
time,
as
though
what
was
involved
here
was
two
distinct
bodies
of
gas,
two
physically
distinct
bodies
of
gas,
gulf’s
gas
and
southland’s
gas,
as
they
put
it.
thus
in
respondent’s
brief
at
page
13
it
is
stated,
the
commission
held
that
southland
royalty’s
gas
was
dedicated
to
interstate
service
because
gulf
had
made
an
interstate
sale
of
gulf’s
leasehold
gas.
whether
gulf
thus
dedicated
southland
royalty’s
gas,
is
the
issue
before
this
court;
that
is
the
respondent’s
view
of
it.
in
pursuit
of
this
theory,
the
respondents
analogized
the
case
to
the
situation
of
vertical
or
horizontal
limitations
on
interstate
sales.
the
case
where,
where
a
producer
limits
vertically
to
a
certain
distance
below
the
ground,
the
gas
that
is
being
sold
interstate
or
where
a
producer
limited
horizontally,
say
to
500
acres
of
a
thousand
acre
track,
or
respondents
analogized
the
case
to
that
of
a
split
stream
where
certain
producers
owning
shares
in
a
producing
property,
make
interstate
sales
of
their
gas
while
other
producers
make
intrastate
sales
of
their
shares.
and
respondents
say
that
this
case
is
in
their
terms,
simply
the
case
of
a
severance
in
time
rather
than
a
severance
in
space.
quote,
from
their
brief
at
page
12,
“the
severance
between
a
fixed
term
lease
hold
interest
and
a
mineral
fee
interest
is
a
severance
in
time
rather
than
a
horizontal
or
a
vertical
severance
in
space”.
and
to
respondents,
they
are
both
the
same
and
this
case
should
be
analogized
to
the
others,
as
mr.
attwell
said
last
time,
it
is
just
as
if
gulf
owned
black
acre
and
southland
owned
white
acre,
the
parcels
are
that
separate
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
held
here,
applying
texas
law.
well,
there
are
several
reasons
why
we
think
this
analogy
is
no
good,
why
we
think
a
severance
in
time,
that
is
the
severance
created
here
between
the
leasehold
and
the
reversionary
estate
is
quite
different
for
purposes
of
the
natural
gas
act
from
the
spatial
severances
to
which
respondents
would
analogize
it.
first
of
all,
the
argument
ignores
the
certificates
that
were
granted
to
gulf
here.
the
certificates
granted
to
gulf
here
were
not
limited
in
time.
now
in
this
case,
we
know
that
it
is
clearly
as
we
ever
could
because
the
very
certificates
that
were
granted
to
gulf
for
this
particular,
for
the
reserves
under
the
waddell
ranch,
were
before
this
court,
in
the
sun
oil
case
and
were
expressly
held
there
not
to
be
limited
in
time.
that
is
the
first
thing
we
find
wrong
with
the
argument.
but
more
important,
the
attempt
to
analogize
the
severance,
the
so
called
severance
in
time
here,
with
these
limitations
of
space
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
natural
gas
act.
there
is
first
of
all
a
physical
difference.
in
the
case
of
the
vertical
or
horizontal
limitation
on
the
interstate
sale,
the
stream
never
flows
in
interstate
commerce.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
simply
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
gas
that
flows
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
first
place.
there
is
no
stream
flowing
in
interstate
commerce
that
would
be
shut
off
and
diverted
to
intrastate
commerce
as
would
happen
here,
if
respondents
prevail.
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case,
respondents
here
claim
that
by
virtue
of
their
state
is
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
property
owner
under
texas
law,
they
may
cut
off
a
stream
of
gas
from
given
reserves,
that
is
flowing
to
interstate
commerce
at
the
end
of
this
lease
and
diverted
physically
to
the
intrastate
market
instead
without
having
to
get
the
commissions
abandonment
authority
under
section
7
(b).
now,
the
distinction
here
is
crucial
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
section
b
and
indeed
of
the
entire
act.
that
purpose
as
this
court
emphasized
in
sunray
among
other
cases
is
to
protect
the
continuity
of
service
to
the
interstate
market.
the
stability
of
natural
gas
prices
and
supply.
well,
in
the
case
of
the
vertical
or
horizontal
limitation
on
the
sale,
the
interstate
market
never
comes
to
rely
on
that
sale
because
the
gas
is
never
flowing
to
the
interstate
market
in
the
first
place.
the
interstate
consumers
cannot
become
dependent
on
the
part
of
the
gas
reserve,
on
the
part
of
the
gas
who
would
now
be
reserved
for
intrastate
use
because
that
part
never
entered
interstate
commerce
in
the
first
place.
here
in
contrast,
the
stream
of
gas
from
the
reserves
underlying
the
waddell
ranch
has
supplied
el
paso’s
interstate
costumers
since
1951.
el
paso
and
its
costumers
have
come
to
rely
on
that
supply
and
indeed
the
amount
of
gas
involved
in
this
case
represents
more
than
1%
of
el
paso’s
total
annual
foreign
supply
of
gas.
that
is
in
the
record
of
appendix
page
375.
further,
if
el
paso
loses
this
case,
and
if
the
commission
loses
this
case,
the
amount
of
gas
that
el
paso
would
now
have
to
return
to
southland
and
the
other
reversionary
owners
under
the
protective
agreement,
now
amounts
to
37
million
mcf,
that
is—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
that
is
not
in
the
record;
that
is
figured
as
of
march
1st,
1978,
supplied
by
the
commission.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
the
point
is—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
the
point
is
that
that
gas
would
have
to
come
out
of
the
interstate
market.
it
would
have
to
come
out
of
supplies
that
el
paso
would
otherwise
to
be
able
to
provide
to
the
interstate
market
and
that
illustrates
the
purpose
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
which
is
to
assure
supply
to
the
interstate
market.
further,
so
as
i
was
saying,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
it
seems
to
us,
distinguishes
sharply
between
the
flow
that
has
began
and
would
not
be
cut
off
by
what
respondents
call
a
severance
in
time
and
a
horizontal
or
vertical
limitation
or
a
split
stream
limitation
where
the
gas
never
flows
to
the
interstate
market
in
the
first
place
and
thus
there
is
no
reliance
on
it
and
no
continuity
to
protect.
further,
we
submit
that
the
very
language
of
section
7(b),
the
very
word
abandonment,
distinguishes
between
a
severance
in
time
and
a
spatial
severance.
a
statutory
requirement
that
a
service
may
not
be
abandoned
is
precisely
a
command
that
a
severance
in
time
is
not
permitted,
that
is
what
abandonment
means.
now
if
the
statute
also
had
a
provision
that
prohibited
any
spatial
segmentation,
that
prohibited
any
percentage
segmentation
of
a
gas
reserve,
then
it
might
be
appropriate
to
argue
the
severances
in
space,
can
be
analogized
to
severances
in
time.
but
there
is
no
such
provision;
the
very
purpose
and
meaning
of
abandonment
is
that
you
cannot
stop
something
that
has
been
started,
that
a
severance
in
time
is
to
be
distinguished
from
a
severance
in
space.
now,
this
is
supported
also
by
this
court’s
decisions,
for
example,
the
lo-vaca
case,
california
versus
lo-vaca
gathering
379
us
366,
cited
in
el
paso’s
brief,
holds
that
we
submit
that
once
gas
flows
in
interstate
commerce,
it
is
subjected
to
the
commission’s
jurisdiction.
that
even
without
a
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce,
federal
jurisdiction
follows
the
flow
as
the
court
there
said.
that
too
distinguishes
the
so
called
spatial
severance
which
would
cut
off
a
flow
that
has
began
from
the
cases,
i
am
sorry,
the
so
called
temporal
severance
that
would
cut
off
a
flow
that
has
begun,
from
the
spatial
cases,
where
the
flow
never
starts
in
the
first
place.
now,
we
submit
here
that
what
has
been
dedicated
on
the
facts
of
this
case
by
gulf's
sale
in
interstate
commerce
is
a
service
in
interstate
commerce
and
service
is
a
key
concept
under
section
7
as
this
court
held
in
sunray
of
course,
a
service
of
supplying
gas
from
the
particular
reserves
underlying
the
waddell
ranch.
and
that
that
service,
that
stream
of
gas
running
from
these
particular
reserves
has
been
dedicated
by
gulf’s
sale
and
may
not
be
abandoned
without
the
commission’s
approval.
now,
southland
has
in
fact
taken
a
rather
similar
position
with
which
we
agree.
in
southland’s
brief
before
the
commission,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
a
476,
southland
said
this.
i
am
reading
from
a
476,
preliminarily,
mineral
interest
owners
that
southland
and
the
other
reversioners,
agree
with
el
paso’s
statement,
that
once
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
gas
reserves
may
not
be
removed
from
interstate
commerce
without
abandonment
authorization.
gas
reserves
may
not
be
removed
from
interstate
commerce
without
abandonment
authorization.
that
of
course
is
what
would
happen
here.
this
gas
at
the
end
of
the,
at
termination
of
the
lease
is
flowing
from
the
particular
reserves
under
the
waddell
ranch.
our
position
is
that
that
flow
may
not
be
terminated
until
the
reserves
are
exhausted
without
the
commission’s
approval.
southland
appeared
there
to
have
taken
the
same
position.
we
would
cite
other
support
for
this
notion
that
section
7
applies
to
the
flow
until
the
reserves
are
exhausted.
in
the
hunt
case,
in
the
5th
circuit,
306
fed
2nd
334,
which
the
commission
relied
on
and
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
court
says
that
the
obligation
to
continue
serving
is
like
the
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land,
i
am
sorry,
like
the
ancient
covenant
running
with
the
land,
the
duty
to
continue
to
deliver
and
sell
flows
with
the
gas
from
the
moment
of
the
first
delivery
down
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
reserve
or
until
the
commission
on
appropriate
terms
permits
the
session
of
service
under
section
7(b).
i
might
here
and
since
this
case
talked
about
a
covenant
running
with
the
land,
say
a
word
in
response
to
the
argument
that
our
colleagues
from
texas
have
made,
they
ague
that
this
notion
of
a
covenant
running
with
the
land
would
create
also
as
the
problems
of
clouds
on
title
in
texas
because
one
would
never
know
whether
some
previous
lessee
of
particular
acreage
had
made
an
interstate
sale
and
then
seized
it
and
thus
if
one
discovers
a
completely
new
reserve
on
that
land,
one
might
subsequently
find
that
gas
from
that
reserve
had
been
dedicated.
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
which
our
colleague
from
texas
apparently
did
not
refer
to
last
time,
that
is
not
an
accurate
representation
of
the
position
the
commission
is
taking
here.
the
commission’s
position
here
is
that
this
gas
is
dedicated
until
the
reserve
is
exhausted,
that
in
the
words
of
the
hunt
case,
the
duty
to
continue
to
deliver
and
sell
flows
with
the
gas
from
the
moment
of
the
first
delivery
down
to
the
exhaustion
of
the
reserve.
that
is
the
covenant
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
the
hunt
case
and
that
is
the
covenant
that
we
are
talking
about
here,as
further
support
for
this
notion
of
dedication
of
a
particular
reserve
or
a
particular
field,
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
united
gas
pipeline
case
385
us
83—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
once
the
lessee
has
made
sales
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
a
commission
certificate
which
has
no
limit
on
time;
that
service
is
dedicated
until
the
reserves
run
out,
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
oh
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
right
because
the
lessee
acting
within
the
authority
granted
by
the
lease
began
a
service,
instituted
a
service
which
the
lessee
had
full
authority
to
do
under
the
lease,
which
service
has
come
under
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
and
is
dedicate
the
interstate
commerce
so
long
at
least
does
the
gas
flows
from
the
particular
reserves.
as
southland
had
self
said
before
the
commission,
the
reserves
have
been
dedicated.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
if
the
commission
knew
about
that
clause
the—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
leases
in
fact
as
i
understand
that
are
not
filed
and
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
leases
as
a
matter
of
course,
are
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
but
let
us
assume
that
they
are,
i
assume
that
the
commission
knows
that
the
lessee
has
no
authority
under
the
lease
to
make
an
interstate
sale,
the
commission
would
not
grant
a
certificate.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
that
is
the
legal
conclusion
but
it
is
not
based
on
any
agency
that
the
lessee
has
from
the
lessor,
it
is
based
on
the
facts
of
what
the
lessee
did
within
the
authority
granted
by
the
lease.
the
lessee
was
authorized
to
make
interstate
sales,
in
fact,
may
have
had
a
duty
to,
when
indeed
so,
and
under
the
interstate
and
under
the
natural
gas
act,
with
its
purpose
of
assuring
continuity
to
the
interstate
market,
that
flow,
those
sales
from
those
reserves
may
not
be
abandoned
without
abandonment
authorization.
that
is,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
justice
white,
the
united
gas
pipeline
case,
mr.
justice
white
which
i
was
just
referring
to
was
an
opinion
written
by
you
as
i
recall,
where
the
court
rejected
the
notion
that
the
word
service
under
section
7(b)
could
include
only
the
sale
of
natural
gas,
not
the
taking
and
transportation
of
gas
from
any
particular
field
rather
the
court
said,
at
page
89,
it
could
not
be
more
clear
that
united
here
abandoned
this
service,
the
taking
of
johnson’s
bio-fueled
gas
and
its
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
and
we
would
support
that
for,
we
would
cite
that
for
the
proposition,
that
what
has
begun
is
a
service
of
supplying
gas
from
a
particular
field,
the
particular
reserve
and
that
is
what
may
not
be
cut
off
without
the
commission’s
authorization.
now,
respondents
argue
that
there
is
something
being
done
here
that
is
inconsistent
with
basic
principles
of
property
law.
that
one
cannot
encumber
a
property
interest
that
one
does
not
own
as
they
put
it,
and
hence
that
gulf
cannot
encumber
southland’s
gas,
still
pursuing
their
notion
that
there
are
two
separate
packages
of
gas
here
rather
than
a
continuing
flow
from
the
same
reserve.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
there
are
two
separate
owners—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
question
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
and
until
this
particular
reserve
runs
out
in
any
event,
yes,
or
until
the
commission
grants
abandonment
authority
of
course.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
ah,
there
is
authority
in
texas
law,
the
colt
case
cited
in
our
briefs,
for
the
notion
that
a
lessee
has
a
duty
to
sell
and
at
the
time
of
this,
at
the
time
these
sales
were
made,
the
interstate
market
was
virtually
the
only
place
that
this
gas
could
be
so,
now
the
respondents
in
their
brief
have
argued
that
that
was
not
true
of
texas
as
a
whole
at
this
time.
we
submit
it
was
true
of
the
permian
basin
where
this
gas
comes
from.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
oh,
it
does
not
seem,
i
do
not
think
the
respondents
even
dispute
that
mr.
justice
white.
well,
in
response
to
respondent’s
argument
about
how
one
cannot
supposedly
encumber
a
property
interest
that
one
does
not
own,
we
do
not
see
any
such
radical
innovation
here.
we
point
in
our
brief
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
cases
which
support
the
proposition
that
once
a
lessee
operates
a
railroad
property,
there
can
be
no
abandonment,
either
by
the
lessee,
unless
the
commission
grants
authority
either
to
the
lessee
or
the
lessor.
but
more
basically,
we
would
look
at
the
basic
purpose
of
public
utility
regulation.
the
purpose
of
public
utility
regulation
is
based
on
the
public’s
interest
in
the
service
or
the
property
being
regulated.
the
purpose
is
to
regulate
for
the
public
benefit,
a
business
or
a
property
that
has
become
affected
with
the
public
interest.
and
in
the
natural
gas
act,
section
1(a),
congress
expressly
finds
that
the
business
of
transporting
and
selling
natural
gas
for
ultimate
distribution
to
the
public
is
affected
with
a
public
interest.
now
that
is
the
business
that
the
lessee
here
has
started
under
the
authority
of
the
lease.
the
theory
of
public
interest
regulation
has
never
been
based
on
any
notion
of
estoppel
or
consent
and
thus
respondents
here,
do
not
complain
and
cannot
complain
about
the
fact
that
when
they
granted
their
lease
in
1925,
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the,
that
the
natural
gas
act
would
come
along,
natural
gas
act
would
come
along
later
or
that
the
phillips
decision
would
come
along
later.
they
realized
that
they
are
subjected,
that
the
sales
gulf
made
at
least
were
subjected
to
the
commission
of
jurisdiction
even
though
they
never
consented
to
that
when
they
made
the
sale.
and
thus,
since
the
purpose
of
public
utility
regulation
is
based
on
the
public’s
interest
in
what
is
being
regulated
and
not
on
any
notion
of
estoppel
or
waiver
or
consent
by
the
owner,
it
should
not
matter
that
it
is
the
lessor
rather
than
the
lessee
who
by
virtue
of
property
law
has
come
into
control
of
the
property
being
regulated.
let
me
try
a
hypothetical
case
which
may
illustrate
this.
suppose
an
owner
of
a
large
track
land
leases
it
for
25
or
50
years
to
a
developer,
this
is
undeveloped
real
estate,
the
land
is
leased
to
a
developer
and
the
lessee
proceeds
to
build
residential
housing,
say
garden
apartments
on
the
land,
now
at
the
time
of
the
lease,
the
land
is
not
zoned
at
all,
it
is
undeveloped
and
un-zoned.
but
as
a
result
of
the
lessee’s
construction
of
the
residential
housing,
the
local
government
authorities
steps
in
and
zones
the
land
residential.
suppose
even
further
that
the
lessee
appears
at
the
zoning
hearing
and
then
supports
the
residential
zoning,
now
at
the
expiration
of
that
lease,
25
or
50
years
later,
when
the
lessor
comes
into
the
reversion,
if
the
lessor
wants
to
build
a
factory
on
that
land,
the
lessor
may
find
that
he
cannot
do
so
because
the
land
is
zoned
residential.
and
that
zoning
has
resulted
from
actions
taken
by
the
lessee
under
the
lease.
and
we
submit
that--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
he
could
tear
the
houses
down
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
would
still
have
to
get
the
zoning
changed
i
suppose.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
no,
he
was
still
have
to
get
the
zoning
change
to
build
his
factory
i
assume
even
if
he
could
tear
the
house—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
but
he
does
not,
assuming
that
what
he
wants
to
do
is
build
a
factory
on
a
portion
of
the
property
that
would
not
require
tearing
the
houses
down,
in
any
event,
the
point
is
this
property
is
now
zoned
residential,
he
would
have
to
get
that
zoning
change
somehow,
and
that
is
in
respondents
terms,
or
the
respondents
might
say,
the
lessee
has
somehow
encumbered
the
reversion
of
real
state.
we
see
nothing
strange
in
it,
all
that
has
happened
is
that
the
lessee
has
done
something
under
the
lease
and
within
the
authority
granted
by
the
lease,
which
is
brought
on
in
these
regulatory
consequences—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
there
certainly
was
an
opportunity
on
behalf
of
the
land
owners
of
the
lessors
in
this
case
to
intervene
in
the
commission
proceeding
and
indeed,
the
record
here
states
that
there
was
no
protest,
no
intervention
in
the
proceeding
which
gulf—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
cannot
assert
on
the
records
that
the
lessors
here
knew
of
the
proceeding,
however,
they—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
can
say
that
when
the
2nd
certificate
was
granted
to
gulf
here
in
19,
in
1962,
i
think
it
was,
at
that
time,
by
that
time,
the
lessor
certainly
must
have
known
that
sales
were
being
made
in
the
interstate
market,
they
were
receiving
royalties
and
the
record
reflected
there
was
no
protest
or
intervention
in
that
proceeding
either.
so
i,
it
seems
to
me
fair
to
assume
that
this
is
not
a
problem
of
them,
not
having
a
notice
and
they
have
not
asserted
that
they
did
not
have
notice
of
the
commission
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
but
the,
as
i
say,
they
do
not
appear
to
contend
here
and
they
did
not
have
notice
of
the
commission
proceeding.
and
so
we
would
submit
that
that
is
simply
a
similar
situation,
it
is
a
case
cited
in
el
paso’s
brief,
at
page
9
note
5,
a
new
york
case
which
supports
a
similar
kind
of
consequence
under
the
zoning
laws.
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
things
finally
about
the
consequences
of
this
decision,
we
submit
that
if
this
decision
below
is
not
reversed,
it
would
substantially
impair
the
commission’s
regulatory
authority
over
natural
gas,
would
undercut
the
commission’s
ability
to
assure
an
adequate
and
reliable
supply
of
natural
gas
to
the
nation
and
ability
which
this
courts
since
the
phillips
case
has
driven
to
uphold.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
for
the
future,
i
suppose
the
commission
could
do
that,
that
would
not
handle
a
lot
of
the
cases
that
have
already
come
up,
the
commission
might
find
that
if
they
did
that,
it
would
have
less
gas
dedicated
or
i
suppose
the
commission
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
suppose
the
commission
could
do
that
for
the
future.
it
should
be
noted
in
the
first
place
that
there
is
a
lot
of
gas
involved
in
this
case.
our
respondents
have,
be
little,
the
amount
of
gas
involved
here
saying
in
their
brief
at
page
14
and
this
case
involves
a
miniscule
fraction
of
the
united
states
market
at
natural
gas
production.
they
do
not
cite
miniscule
fraction
there,
they
did
cite
in
their
brief
and
our
position
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
at
page
11
note
7,
and
that
fraction
is
.08,
that
is
8/10th
of
1%
of
all
the
gas
production
in
the
nation
is
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
onshore
and
offshore
8/10th
of
1%,
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
a
miniscule
amount—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
.08
is
the
fraction.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
is
.08,
almost
one—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
am
sorry,
it
is
almost,
it
must
be
almost
1/10th
of
1%.
i
will
check
that
on
the
rebuttal
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
sorry.
as
i
have
said
before,
that
is
more
than
1%
of
el
paso’s
total
annual
requirements.
the
significance
of
this
case
is
further
illustrated
by
the
interest
of
the
states
of
texas,
new
mexico
and
louisiana
and
that
to
them,
it
is
not
a
minor
case.
further
the,
the
effect
of
the
case
would
not
be
limited
to
fixed
term
leases.
it
would
in
fact
very
possibly
extend
to
the
kind
of
lease
that
is
quite
common
and
that
was
involved
in
the
pennzoil
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
that
was
simply
a
typical
life
of
the
reserves
lease,
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
30
to
33.
a
life
of
the
reserve’s
lease
providing
for
royalties
to
be
based
on
the
market
value
of
the
gas,
the
lessor
insisted
that
this
meant
the
intrastate
market
value.
the
court,
the
state
court
upheld
that
and
the
lessees
apply
to
the
commission
for
an
exception
from
the
commission’s
sealing
price,
arguing
that
they
would
have
to
pay
that
higher
rate
and
they
argue
that
if
they
could
not
pay
that
higher
rate,
the
lease
would
be
terminated
for
failure
to
pay
the
royalties.
the
commission
responded
that
if
the
lease
is
terminated,
well
the
lessors
will
still
have
to
carry
on
the
service,
citing
the
commission’s
decision
in
the
southland
case.
the
fifth
circuit
however,
in
reversing
the
commission
in
pennzoil,
said
that
is
not
the
case,
the
commission
was
operating
on
a
wrong
legal
premise
in
southland
in
assuming
that
that
gas
was
trapped
in
the
interstate
market
as
the
fifth
circuit
put
it.
thus
it
is
quite
possible
that
under
such
leases,
that
under
such
leases
if
the
lessor
terminates
for
failure
to
pay
the
higher
rates,
the
lessor
is
then
in
control
and
under
texas
property
law
as
a
respondents
assert
here,
there
is
a
separate
state
which
is
not
subject
to
the
interstate
dedication.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
please.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
just
a
few
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
with
the
respect
to
that
fumble,
that
fraction
that
i
fumbled,
it
is
.08
of
1%
that
is
nearly
1/10th
of
1%.
and
as
i
said
that
was;
that
is
more
than
1%
of
el
paso’s
firm
annual
requirement.
with
respect
to
mr.
attwell’s
argument
that
the
case
is
really
based
on
section
7(e)
not
7(b)
because
gulf
was
not
able
and
willing
to
initiate
the
service,
there
are
several
answers
to
that.one
is
that
it
contradicts
the
certificates;
the
certificates
granted
to
gulf
said
precisely
that
gulf
is
able
and
willing
to
perform
the
service
and
these
certificates
were
limited,
were
unlimited
at
time,
not
limited
to
the
50
years
of
the
lease.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
not
permanently,
we
will
not
take
to
gulf-
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
commission
could
make
gulf
sell
southland’s
gas
permanently.
the
commission
held
that
gulf
must
seek
abandonment.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
so
long
as
they
also
have
power
to
deny
southland
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
so
long
as
southland
is
there
but
we
do
not.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
i
think
that
is
true
too
that
the
commission
could—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
someone
else
could
be
a
substituted
for
gulf
i
suppose.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
in
that
case,
that
is
what
i
have
in
mind
by
saying
the
lessor
could
bring
in
someone
other
than
gulf
to—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
think
southland
itself
could—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
i
think
southland
itself
could
be
substituted
for
gulf
if
necessary.
the
point
is
that
southland
ultimately
is
the
natural
gas
company
by
virtue
of
having
succeeded
to
this
dedicated
service
in
natural
gas.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well
you
do
not
have
to
build
a
pipeline
to
be
a
seller
of
natural
gas
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
many
owners
of
producing
interest
who
have
no
facilities
in
the
sense
of
pipes
or
anything
but
which
our
natural
gas
companies
under
the
act
because
they
are
engaged
in
sales
of
natural
gas.
indeed
we
would
say
the
reserve
itself
is
the
facility
if
you
need
a
facility.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
gulf
has
a
continuing
service
which
is
still
performing
and
as
the
commission
said—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
all
the
commission
said
was
that
we
are
requiring
gulf
to
seek
abandonment
so
that
we
will
have
all
the
parties
before
us
if
we
have
to
rearrange
their
legal
arrangements,
it
is
really
a
sort
of—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
they
could
order
southland
to
make
a
lease
with
somebody
to
continue
selling.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
to
make
clear
that
southland
is
required
to
continue
this
service
which
gulf
has
begun
under
the
lease.
the
commission
said
we
have,
we
need
all
the
parties
before
us
if
we
are
going
to,
i
think
it
said
rearrange,
resettle
their
legal
arrangements
but
the
point
is
that
southland
contends
that
it
does
not
have
to
sell
this
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce,
the
commission
would
be
telling
it
that
it
does,
that
is
a
rearrangement
of
the
legal
arrangement
at
least
to
southland
view
as
it
was.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
in
the
sense
that
after
the
50
years
it
now
has
power
to
require
gulf,
to
require
southland
to
sell
the
gas—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
to
stay
in
the
picture—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
i
do
not,
not
if
southland
wants
another
lessee,
but
if
gulf
is
being
in
the
picture
is
necessary
to
effectuate
--
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
no,
it
has
the
power
to
deny
the
petition
for
gulf’s
abandonment
or
to
require
gulf
the
files
that
you
petitioned
as
it
did
here—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
yes,
in
the
united
gas
pipeline
case,
the
commission
required
the
pipeline
to
keep
purchasing
in
the
sunray
case,
it
required
the
seller
to
keep
selling,
that
would
be
the
same
thing
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
not
if
southland
has
someone
else
it
wants
in
the
picture
instead
of
gulf.
but
if
southland
does
not
have
someone
else,
if
southland’s
objection
is
based
on
not
wanting
this
gas
to
be
sold
to
interstate
commerce—
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
well,
that
may
be
one
reason,
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
the
present
record
as
i
understand
do
not
show
the
lease
and
this
case
was
brought
by
declaratory
judgment
action
before
the
commission.
i
think
ordinarily
the
commission
would
not
be
aware
that
a
particular
lease
is
expired.
mr.
stephen
r.
barnett
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not
keep
records
of
leases,
i
could
be
wrong
but
that
is
my
understanding.
