mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
california
is
here
today
as
a
consumer
state
of
interstate
natural
gas
service.
the
facts
of
this
case
directly
affect
california,
however,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
so
undermines
one
of
the
fundamental
protections
for
the
gas
consumers
of
the
united
states,
that
we
are
basically
here
to
plead
the
cause
of
those
consumers
on
policy
grounds.
factually,
california
receives
--
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
i
am
sorry
sir,
what
i
mean
is
that
we
certainly
agree
with
the
statements
said,
the
solicitors
made
as
us
to
the
law
of
the
case.
what
i
wanted
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
was
the
various
situations
in
the
interstate
gas
market
today.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
factually,
the
state
of
california
receives
approximately
90
percent
of
its
gas
from
the
interstate
market.
our
major
supplier
of
that
gas
is
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
upheld,
some
35
million
cubic
feet
a
day
of
gas
will
be
lost
to
the
el
paso
system
without
the
abandonment
authorization.
this
is
sufficient
to
heat
approximately
120,000
homes.
california
would
receive
approximately
75
percent
of
that
gas
under
normal
circumstances,
but
we
believe
that
the
theory
--
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
gas
has
already
been
contracted
in
intrastate
commerce
within
the
state
of
texas
and
i
have
no
idea
what
the
use
of
that
gas
would
be-
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
my
argument
is
that
first
of
all,
this
gas
goes
to
all
the
states
on
the
el
paso
system
but
more
importantly,
the
theory
of
the
case
could
be
applied
not
only
to
these
two
fixed
term
leases
but
to
all
types
of
leases
including
life
of
production
leases.
therefore,
that
the
facts
or
the
theory
of
the
case
could
be
applied
to
cause
a
loss
of
a
great
deal
more
gas
from
the
interstate
system
and
this
is
in
opposite
to
one
of
the
basic
protections
of
the
consumer
in
the
united
states
unto
the
natural
gas
act,
which
is
to
have
an
assurance
of
inadequate
and
reliable
supply
of
gas
in
interstate
service.
in
deciding
this
case,
california
believes
that
the
court
should
consider
the
purpose
for
which
the
natural
gas
act
was
enacted
and
the
impact,
the
decision
of
this
court
will
have
on
the
consumers
of
the
united
states.
in
deciding
that,
we
would
like
to
bring
to
your
attention
two
factors
in
the
gas
market
today
that
will
have
an
effect
on
this
case
and
have
an
effect
on
the
commission’s
ability
to
ensure
continuing,
reliable
and
adequate
supply
of
gas
in
the
interstate
market,
that
is
shortages
in
natural
gas
in
the
interstate
market
and
the
disparity
of
price
in
the
interstate,
between
the
interstate
and
intrastate
market.
california,
receiving
over
90
percent
of
its
gas
from
the
interstate
market,
has
found
that
there
has
been
a
significant
decline
in
gas,
some
nine
percent
a
year
dedicated
to
that
market
and
subsequently
declining
supplies
to
california.
this
is
true
for
the
united
states
and
this
shown
by
the
amici
briefs
of
new
york
and
the
associated
gas
producers.
the
effect
of
the
shortages
were
dramatically
shown
in
the
winter’s
freeze
of
1976,
where
natural
gas
could
not
get
to
the
northern
tier
states.
it
has
an
immediate
effect
on
the
health,
well-being
and
economic
viability
of
the
gas
consumers.
now,
a
major
reason
for
these
shortages
is
a
disparity
in
price
between
the
interstate
and
intrastate
market.
the
intrastate
market
of
course
is
unregulated
and
the
price
has
been
as
high
as
over
two
dollars,
a
thousand
cubic
feet.
the
selling
price
in
the
interstate
market
is
$1.44.
california
is
not
here
to
disparage
the
fundamental
economic
motivation
of
someone
to
sell
their
gas
at
the
highest
price
possible.
what
we
are
bringing
to
the
court’s
attention
is
that
the
chronic
shortages
in
the
interstate
market
combined
with
the
disparity
of
price
and
added
to
this
motivation
to
sell
gas
at
the
highest
price
possible,
puts
untenable
pressures
on
the
commission
to
uphold
this
fundamental
protection
which
is
to
ensure
a
continuing,
adequate
and
reliable
supply
of
gas
in
the
interstate
service.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
the
federal
power
commission,
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
1950’s,
it
was
in
the
interest
of
producers
to
sell
their
gas
in
the
interstate
market.
in
1977,
it
is
in
their
interest
to
sell
their
gas
in
the
intrastate
market,and
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
applied
to
leases
gives
producers
just
the
vehicle
that
they
need
to
carry
out
their
economic
interestto
determine,
to
be
able
to
take
gas
from
interstate
commerce,
either
now
or
some
time
during
the
life
of
production
and
move
that
to
intrastate
commerce
without
worrying
about
the
public
interest
and
without
having
the
commission
being
able
to
determine
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
of
whether
this
gas
can
be
removed
from
interstate
commerce
and
we
think
this
violates
--
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
i
am
sorry
justice
marshall.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
commission
has
a
duty
to
ensure
an
adequate
supply
of
gas
in
the
interstate
market.
i
am
saying
that
the
chronic
shortages
which
make
it
a
seller’s
market
combined
with
this
case
allow
producers,
give
producers
an
opportunity
to
move
their
gas
from
the
interstate
market
to
the
intrastate
market
or
in
the
future
to
make
leases
that
give
them
that
opportunity
and
this
is
a
pressure
put
on
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
there
is
an
adequate
supply
in
the
interstate
market
and
not
to
allow
this
abandonment
unless
the
gas
well
has
been
depleted
or
that
it
is
—
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
no.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
my
argument
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
can
be
applied
to
all
forms
of
leases
and
that
theory
concerning
leases,
which
allows
leases
to
be
drawn
up
which
would
avoid
section
7b
abandonment
provisions--
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
well,
my
legal
argument
is,
as
the
solicitor
stated
that
gas
cannot
be
removed,
section
7b
says
that,
“the
gas
cannot
be
removed
from
interstate
commerce
once
it
is
has
been
dedicated,”
without
a
section
7b,
abandonment
authorization.
the
gas
in
this
case
was
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce,
an
unlimited
certificate
was
given.
gulf
had
the
right
to
dedicate
all
that
gas,
in
fact,
if
the
production
circumstances
had
been
different,
gulf
could
have
sold
all
of
that
gas
before
the
termination
of
the
50
years
and
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners
had
only
a
future
expectation.
until
that
vested
at
the
end
of
the
50
years,
they
did
not
what
gas
would
be
left.
all
of
that
gas
was
in
fact
dedicated
in
interstate
market
and
could
have
been
produced
and
sold
in
the
interstate
market
and
under
the
clear
language
of
section
7b,
that
gas
once
dedicated
for
whatever
reason,
no
matter
how
justified
the
reason,
cannot
be
removed
from
interstate
commerce
in
the
first
instance,
until
the
commission,
within
its
jurisdiction
has
determined
that
abandonment
can
be
made.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
yes,
it
does,
i
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
two
points
raised
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
leases
could
not
be
made
that
would
terminate
prematurely
natural
gas
service
in
interstate
commerce,
because
it
would
be
against
the
economic
interest
of
the
producer
to
do
so
because
of
the
initial
cost
of
production.
i
would
like
to
make
several
comments
on
that.
first
of
all,
we
have
the
possibility
of
lease
situations
that
affect
adversely
the
consumer
even
though
they
do
not
necessarily
affect
the
producer.
and
we
see
this
in
cases
now
in
the
court
below
more
than
the
fifth
circuit
concerning
the
area
of
royalty
gas,
where
the
issue
is
whether
the
royalty
payment
to
a
lessor
should
be
based
on
the
intrastate
or
interstate
price
of
gas.
the
secondary
issue
there
is
whether
the
gas,
the
lessor
can
terminate
the
lease,
thereby
causing
the
gas
to
revert
back
to
the
lessor,
if
the
lessor
does
not
receive
the
value
that
he
thinks
he
should.
under
the
theory
of
this
case,
that
would
avoid
the
abandonment
provision.
another
factual
situation
concerns
a
lessor’s
ability
to
retain
a
royalty
interest
with
the
right
to
convert
that
into
a
working
interest,
a
situation
that
arose
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case.
in
that
case,
the
lessor
did
convert
the
gas
into
a
working
interest
and
attempted
to
sell
it
as
new
gas
in
interstate
commerce
without
seeking
abandonment
authorization.
now
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
that
gas
was
dedicated
but
i
think
there
is
no
guarantee
that
other
courts
of
appeal
would
also
hold
that
specially
if
in
this
case,
the
fifth
circuit
is
upheld.
there
are
other
situations
involving
termination
for
lack
of
production.
a
producer
with
a
marginal
well
could
find
it
in
his
best
interest
to
simply
abandon
that
well,
allowing
the
gas
lease
to
terminate
and
he
could
move
on
to
more
productive
areas,
but
that
avoids
section
7b
abandonment.
perhaps
the
commission
would
find
that
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
produce
that
marginal
gas
that
that
producer
is
still
getting
a
fair
rate
of
return.one
overall
comment
in
this
area
and
one
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court,
it
is
a
seller’s
market.
there
is
a
tremendous
chronic
shortage
of
natural
gas.
whether
the
producers
like
it
or
not,
whether
the
commission
likes
it
or
not,
it
is
the
theory
of
this
case
that
leases
can
avoid
section
7b
abandonment
authorization
is
upheld,
i
think
we
will
find
a
great
many
leases
that
include
provisions
that
allow
for
termination
if
certain
circumstances
occur
during
the
production
in
the
life
of
the
lease
and
neither
the
commission
nor
producers
will
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it
because
those
are
the
type
of
leases
they
are
faced
with.
one
last
point
concerning
the
issue
raised
about
the
cloud
on
real
property
in
the
state
of
texas.
first,
what
we
perceive
here
is
a
congressional
regulatory
requirement
placed
on
interstate
gas
service.
we
do
not
see
the
cloud
on
real
estate
title.
that
gas
has
reverted
to
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners,
they
have
full
title
to
it,
they
will
receive
the
proceeds
for
the
sale
of
that
gas.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
thank
you.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
when
it
is
presented
in
a
decision
in
the
court
below,
is
an
attack
on
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
it
raises
a
central
issue
of
whether
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
possesses
a
jurisdiction
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
protect
the
public,
the
public’s
continuity
of
interstate
service,
at
reasonable
rate.
now
my
colleague
has
already
referenced
the
congressional
intents
stated
in
section
1(a)
of
the
act
that
the
business
of
transporting
and
selling
natural
gas
for
ultimate
distribution
to
the
public
is
affected
with
the
public
interest,
we
believe
that
section
7,
and
specifically
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
embodies
the
heart
of
that
public
protection.
the
essential
meaning
of
the
abandonment
requirement
of
section
7(b)
is
to
protect
the
public
from
a
loss
of
gas
in
interstate
service
upon
which
it
has
come
to
rely.
california
agrees
with
the
statement
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
original
sunray
case
at
239
federal
2nd
101
which
states,
no
single
factor
in
the
commission’s
duty
to
protect
that
public
can
be
more
important
to
the
public
than
the
continuity
of
service
furnished.
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
deal
expressly
with
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
over
the
gas
which
is
a
subject
of
an
expired
lease.
we
think
that
this
particular
circumstance,
makes
it
entirely
proper
when
deciding
the
commission’s
jurisdiction
in
this
particular
instance
to
look
at
the
reason
why
the
act
was
passed
and
the
impact
on
the
consuming
public.
my
colleague
has
already
mentioned
the
immediate
impact
as
a
loss
of
some
25
million
cubic
feet
a
day
of
gas
from
the
interstate
market.
this
is
gas
that
el
paso
has
partially
relied
on
in
building
gas
facilities;
this
is
gas
that
the
consumers
partially
relied
on
in
putting
gas
appliances
in
his
home.
we
also
agree
with
the
statement
that
this
decision
of
the
court
below
can
foster
reliance
upon
forms
of
leasehold
arrangements
which
under
the
protection
of
local
law,
will
permit
lessors
to
reenter
into
possession
of
gas
reserves
at
their
discretion,
ignoring
the
public
interest
and
divert
supplies
from
the
interstate
service.
this
is
a
very
real
threat
today.
it
is
a
real
threat
because
of
the
difference
and
diversions
of
gas
prices
in
the
interstate
and
intrastate
market,
there
is
a
--,
obviously
the
interstate
market
is
regulated
and
the
intrastate
market
is
not.
there
is
also
a
great
shortage
of
gas
in
the
interstate
market
and
there
is
not
necessary
that,
that
shortage
in
the
intrastate
market.
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
producers
to
be
able
to
lead
the
interstate
market
at
their
discretion,
in
order
to
make
the
best
profit
possible
from
this
gas.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
commission
will
be
for
close
from
exercising
any
authority
over
interstate
service
of
gas
supplies
covered
by
the
leases
which
terminate
because
of
clauses
in
these
leases.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
they
did
not
--
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
and
i
believe
that
is
the
purpose
for
the
act,
if
they
have
no
way
of
judging
the
specific
dedication
of
gas—
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
well
perhaps,
i
failed
to
say
or
i
thought
i
have
that
impartial
reliance,
i
was
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
the
overall
picture
that
the
consumers
are
relying
on
the
continuous
and
reliable
stream
of
gas
in
interstate
service.
and
i
believe
that
was
the,
one
of
the
main
purposes,
the
act
was
passed
and
one
of
the
main
duties
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission;
because
the
consumer
cannot
himself
determine,
what
each
particular
gas
contract
might
say,
it
is
up
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
protect
the
consumer,
and
the
consumer’s
reliance
on
a
reliable
and
continuous
stream
of
gas.
that
is
one
of
the
most
important
elements—
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
the
lessor
did
not
have
notice
that
this
would
be
the
consequence,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
obligation
to
continue
the
certified
service
is
not
one
imposed
by
the
agreement
between
the
lessor
and
the
lessee
is
imposed
by
the
natural
gas
act
and
i
would
submit
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
the
sunray
decision,
that
the
idea
of
service
is
something
separate
and
apart,
service
of
natural
gas
and
to
the
public
is
something
separate
and
apart
than
the
agreement
which
initiates
that
service.
and
i
would
further
submit
that
this
is
part
of
the
idea
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
that
a
particular
agreement,
in
order
to
be
certified
initially
has
to
be
justified
by
the
service
to
which
it
relates.
if
there
is
no
justification
in
terms
of
the
public
interest,
then
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
should
not
certify
that
agreement
in
the
first
place,
so,
i
would,
and
in
answer
to
your
question
i
would
say
that,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
that
the
lessor
had
notice
at
the
beginning
of
that
50
years,
in
fact,
i
do
not
believe
the
natural
gas
act
had
been
passed
at
that
time.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
yes
justice
white,
and
i
would
add
that,
we
must
remember
at
the
beginning
of
this
lease
term,
gulf,
the
lessee
had
the
right
to
sell
all
of
the
gas
under
this
reserve
and
i
think
he
had
a
duty
to
get
the
best
price
for
that
reserve,
not
only
for
that
gas,
not
only
for
himself
but
for
the
reversionary
interest
holders,
which
were
receiving
a
royalty
at
that
time.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
i
think
that
would
be
state
law
just,
it
would
be
state
law,
but
the
point
is,
that
at
that
time,
it
was
in
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owner’s
interest
for
that
gas
to
be
sold
in
interstate
commerce.
today,
it
is
in
his
interest
to
have
that
gas
sold
in
intrastate
commerce,
but
the
question
is,
under
the
natural
gas
act,
is
it
in
the
consumers’
interest
and
under
the
theory
of
southland,
the
consumer’s
interest
which
the
natural
gas
act
requires
a
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
look
at,
could
not
be
looked
at,
at
all.
the
continuing
stream
of
gas
would
simply
be
terminated,
because
the
lease
terminated.
i
think
the
theory
of
the
case
is,
is
that
now,
the
reversionary
mineral
interest
owners,
received
not
the
royalty
interest
but
the
entire
sales
price
from
this
gas,
that
is
sold
in
interstate
commerce
at
a
rate
set
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
but
i
think
that
this
court
from
the
phillips
petroleum
company
versus
wisconsin
case
through
the
catco
and
sunray
and
lo-vaca
cases,
have
always
recognized
that
there
was
a
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
consuming
public’s
continuity
of
natural
gas
service
at
reasonable
prices
and
if
determined
or
reached
decisions
on
the
natural
gas
act
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
randolph
w.
deutsch
i
think
that
this
court
recognized
the
basic
fundamental
intent
of
congress.
to
protect
the
consumer
in
passing
a
natural
gas
act
and
i
think,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
point,
i
think
the
southland
would
probably
tell
you
that
without
the
natural
gas
act,
without
regulation,
there
might
be
more
gas
in
the
interstate
market.
and
so
--
there
might
very
well
be,
but
the
point
is,
congressional
intent
was
to
protect
the
consuming
public
because
as
justice
brennan
said
in
the
sunray
case
that
if
the
producers
and
pipelines
were
left
completely
free
to
determine
when
to
enter
and
when
to
leave
the
market
and
what
prices
to
charge
without
the
federal
power
commission
looking
after
their
interests,
there
could
be
economic
chaos
at
the
local
level.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
time
is
up,
thank
you
very
much—
