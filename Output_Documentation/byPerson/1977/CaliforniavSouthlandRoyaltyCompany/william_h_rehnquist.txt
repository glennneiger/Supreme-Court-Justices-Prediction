rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
you
are
to
plead
it
on
policy
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
you
will
have
some
relation
i
take
it,
to
the
statute
or
administrative
law
in
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
untenable
pressures
on
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
or
the
federal,
what
used
to
be
the
federal
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
gulf,
by
producing
more
rapidly
out
of
the
leased
properties
have
taken
a
larger
amount
of
gas
out
of
the
property
that
it
in
fact
did,
or
is
the
record
silent
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
saying
is
congress
has
not
authorized
the
fpc
to
regulate
that
sort
of
sale?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
commission,
required
that
the
lessor
joined
with
the
lessee
in
making
an
application
to
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
natural
consequences
of
the
phillips
decision
that
is—
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
.08
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
.08
over
a
hundred
or
simply
.08
decimal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
almost
1%?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
law
would
be
the
source
of
that
duty,
state
or
federal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
certainly
congress
did
not
need
a
claim
of
public
reliance
when
it
enacted
the
federal
power
act
of
1934,
it
could
just
legislate
under
its
commerce
power
until
owners
of
oil
royalties
and
on
oil
pipelines
were
previously
not
been
subjected
to
regulations
that
hereafter
they
were
subjected
to
regulation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
fact
that
it
happened
before
would
be
no
defense
to
that
assertion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
mr.
barnett,
do
you
agree
that
if
the
commission
is
right,
gulf
may
remain
in
the
picture
permanently
until
the
will
expires.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
-—the
well
is
exhausted
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
know
but
they
would
have
power
to
deny
the
petition
for
abandonment
as
long
as
there
was
still
gas
available
in
the
well,
would
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
correct,
but
surely
if
they
have
the
power
over
southland,
it
would
follow
a
fortiori
would
it
not,
that
they
could
keep
gulf
in
the
picture.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
southland
is
a
bunch
of
doctors
sitting
in
los
angeles,
they
are
not
going
want
to
start
building
a
pipeline
themselves.
