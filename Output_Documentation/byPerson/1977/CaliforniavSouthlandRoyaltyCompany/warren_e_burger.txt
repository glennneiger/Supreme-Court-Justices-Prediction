chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-1114
in
the
consolidated
cases,
california
v.
southland
royalty
company.
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
key
words
are
“subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,”
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
you
reading
from
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
barnett.
mr.
deutsch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attwell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
address
that
further
at
one
o’clock.
you
may
continue
mr.
attwell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
also
said
i
think
before
lunch
that
he
can
dedicate
only
what
he
has.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
his
potential
beyond
the
50
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
there
were
a
potential,
let
us
say
an
option
of
some
kind.
that
clearly
would
be
part
of
the
dedication,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
7e?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
the
same
conversation
earlier
today
about
gulf
selling
this
in
intrastate
commerce.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
southland
get
its
title,
interest
or
whatever
to
sell
in
intrastate
commerce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
this
situation
is
analogous
to
a
person
who
has
a
50-
or
30-year
lease
on
a
building
or
piece
of
land
for
traditional
purposes,
not
gas
and
oil
and
he
has
no
power
to
do
anything
with
it
except
to
sell
that
lease
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would,
you
did
concede
that
if
there
were
an
option
for
renewal
or
extension,
that
that
would
be
part
of
the
original
estate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
you
would
say
that
we
were
engaging
in
a
rule-making
process,
de
facto
rule
making.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
attwell.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hear
arguments
next
in
california
against
southland
royalty,
and
the
related
cases.
mr.
barnett,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
the
record
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
difference
would
it
make
if
it
was
ten
times
average—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
two
separate
owners
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
general
owner
and
the
owner
and
one
lessee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
case
turns
on
the
power
of
the
lessee
through
the
act,
to
permit
the
owner
in
perpetuity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
deutsch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
emphasize
the
reliance
of
consumers
on
getting
the
equipment,
how
did
the
consumers
know
that
this
particular
reserve
was
going
to
lapse
to
either,
even
50
years
level
on
beyond
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
really
suggest
that
consumers
go
through
a
process
of
reflection
and
analyze
how
long
a
particular
area
is
going
to
produce
gas,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
do
you,
why
did
you
do
rely
on
that,
you
just
made
an
argument
that
consumers
bought
appliances
and
perhaps
i
assume
you
met,
household
heating,
because
they
were
depending
upon
this
supply.
i
thought
you
made
that
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
notice
did
the
lessor
have
here,
50
years
ago
that
this
would
be
the
consequence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attwell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
response
embrace
intrastate
as
well
as
interstate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
could
they
regulate
intrastate
production
and
shipment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ya
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
under
the
general
welfare
clause;
not
the
commerce
clause.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
will
be
consequence
if
southland
prevails
or
if
it
does
not
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
not
just
the
one—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
someone
like
whom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
the
last
day
of
the
50th
year,
mr.
barnett,
why
is
any
petition
for
abandonment
necessary?
what
does
gulf
have
to
abandon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
it
performed
anything
under
a
lease
after
it
has
expired?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
order
southland
to
make
a
new
lease
with
gulf?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
southland
says
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
at
all,
we
are
tired
of
this
business,
we
are
just
going
to
let
the
gas
stay
where
it
is,
we
would
not
want
to
make
a
new
lease
with
anybody?
can
the
commission
say,
here
are
three
names,
make
a
list
with
one
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
would
not
be
much
difficultly
about
that,
the
commission’s
record
show
the
lease—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
because
that
is
50
years
ago
but
they
certainly
must
keep
records
these
days
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
