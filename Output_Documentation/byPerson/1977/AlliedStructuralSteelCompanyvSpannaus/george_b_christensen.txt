mr.
george
b.
christensen
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
hoped
that
someday
i
would
have
the
pleasure
of
arguing
an
appeal
and
not
have
to
confess
an
inadvertent
typographical
error
in
a
brief.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
refer
to
the
new
jersey
case,
raybestos-manhattan
vs.
glasser
as
being
in
156
atlantic
second.
it
should
be
165
instead
of
156.
we
have
it
correct
in
our
main
brief,
but
it
may
give
your
clerks
a
little
annoyance
since
they
work
for
an
hour.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
raybestos
manhattan.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
appears
in
your
brief
as
156
atlantic
second.
it
should
be
165.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
still
have
not
got
it
right,
now
i
have
i
hope.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
court
may
recall
that
this
is
sort
of
a
companion
case
to
the
white
motor
case
you
decided
recently
involving
the
minnesota
pension
protection
act.
you
there
decided
that
to
the
erisa
of
the
subject
of
patent
regulation
was
not
preempted
by
the
federal
labor
laws
and
you
did
not
touch
any
constitutional
issues.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
pension.
i
have
been
listening
too
much
this
morning,
i
am
afraid.
the
same
pension
statute
is
before
you
in
this
case
that
you
had
before
you
in
the
white
motor
case.
in
substance,
what
minnesota
did,
anticipating
that
erisa
was
coming
which
eventually
would
preempt
the
field,
it
passed
this
10-year
vesting
provision
that
added
to
the
substantive
obligations
of
allied
structural
steelâ€™s
pension
plans
thereby
conferring
an
unexpected
windfall
on
employees.
it
did
this
retroactively,
in
effect
gave
a
retroactive
wage
increase
because
contributions
to
a
pension
plan
are
a
form
of
compensation
for
the
employee
and
as
we
try
to
demonstrate,
and
think
we
do
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
face
of
no
important
or
vital
public
need
that
would
authorize
such
an
intrusion
into
private
contracts.
we
take
the
position
that
if
it
is
what
was
done
here
is
not
impermissible,
if
it
is
upheld,
then
the
impairment
of
contract
clause
is
virtually
gone
from
the
constitution
and
there
would
be
no
limit
upon
what
states
could
do
in
important
business
contracts
whether
they
be
leases,
insurance
policies,
deeds,
pension
plans
or
whatnot,
they
could
play
havoc
with
them
and
destroy
the
stability
in
private
arrangements
that
the
constitution
is
designed
to
procure.
you
will
find
as
you
go
through
the
briefs
your
honors
that
new
jersey
had
a
somewhat
similar
notion
a
little
before
minnesota
and
that
is
this
raybestos-manhattan
case
that
we
refer
to.
there,
they
made
a
statute
somewhat
similar
to
this
imposing,
in
effect
vesting
requirements
long
or
much
earlier
than
the
plan
provided
for
and
they
limited
it
to
employers
of
500
persons
or
more.
new
jersey
has
a
statute
that
is
not,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
common
to
many
states
that
provides
special
legislation.
the
new
jersey
superior
court
struck
the
statute
down
as
unconstitutional,
as
special
legislation
under
their
new
jersey
statute
and
as
denying
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
both
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution
and
that
has
been
affirmed
by
an
opinion
that
came
out
in
late
march
or
early
april,
i
forget
which
is,
yet
unpublished,
but
is
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
the
state
of
minnesota
before
your
honor
does
not
deny
as
i
read
their
brief
that
this
is
a
vital
impairment
of
the
contract
and
you
cannot
imagine
a
much
greater
one
in
our
case
because
we
represent
a
smaller
employer.
there
appears
to
be
about
$150,000.00
of
additional
burden
imposed.
you
cannot
tell
precisely
the
amount
until
actuarial
computations
are
made
and
in
the
white
motor
case
where
far
more
people
were
involved,
there
was
a
difference
of
some
$8
to
$10
million
beyond
the
funds
that
white
had
committed
itself
or
had
reserved
to
pay
its
terminated
employees.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
the
term
has
been
expanded
over
the
years
by
the
courts,
but
there
is
a
very
definite
impairment
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
sense
i
believe
you
were
talking
about
because
allied
had
a
right
to
terminate
this
pension
plan
with
no
penalty
and
minnesota
said
in
effect,
you
cannot
terminate
this
plan
even
though
the
contract
gives
you
an
unlimited
right
so
to
do.
you
cannot
terminate
it
unless
you
pay
this
ransom
money
into
this
state
fund
to
buy
annuities
for
these
people.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
you
can
call
it
a
new
obligation.
you
can
say
depriving
us
of
our
right
to
terminate.
it
is
pretty
much
mr.
chief
justice
a
matter
of
semantics,
but
here
was
a
plan
which
prescribed
how
it
should
be
funded.
it
was
funded
according
to
actuarial
principles
and
of
course
it
assumed
that
not
all
of
the
employees
would
be
present
to
receive
pensions.
they
would
either
die,
be
discharged,
quipped
any
number
of
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
that
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
would
involve
the
obligation
of
contracts
clause.
it
involves
questions
of
due
process.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
it
is
not
too
far
away
from
it,
but
your
honor,
your
point
now
is
addressed
to
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
it
is
not
directed
to
destroying
or
altering
or
changing
a
private
contract.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
is
correct
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
it
would
depend
now
when
the
federal
government
got
to
erisa,
its
second
regulation
of
pension
plans,
it
moved
quite
carefully.
it
brought
the
plan
in
under
a
five-year
implementation
plan.
it
gave
various
options
for
vesting
or
it
permitted
you
to
abandon
the
pension
plan
entirely
with
no
penalty.
it
is
a
very
complicated
statute
and
i
do
not
mean
to
speak
with
great
authority
upon
it.
now,
if
you
go
to
whether
a
state
could
have
as
you
first
put
it,
have
adopted
a
social
security
plan,
i
do
not
think
i
am
prepared
to
answer
that.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
certainly,
but
you
are
now
talking
about
a
thing
unconnected
with
service
just
at
a
certain
age
or
they
put
in
a
tax.
if
you
follow
social
security,
a
state
would
tax
individuals
and
employers
in
some
prescribed
amount
to
build
retirement
payments
at
age
65
or
with
the
permission
of
this
court
now
70
whatever
it
may
be.
now,
that
is
quite
a
different
problem,
mr.
justice.
that
retroactively
is
saying
to
employees
who
have
worked
and
have
received
ever
dime
they
were
entitled
to,
either
in
direct
wages
or
in
the
written
promises
or
fringe
benefits
such
as
this
pension
plan.
you
would
go
back
and
pay
more
money
to
those
people
by
a
sort
of
a
retroactive
vesting.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
on
the
second
assumption,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you.
what
went
in
there
was
there
for
all
times
and
purposes.
now
of
course,
contributions
made
five
years
ago
on
behalf
of
employee
'a'
who
died
in
the
interim,
stay
in
the
fund
and
help
fund
or
provide
money
for
employee
c,
d
and
so
forth,
but
it
does
not
revert
back
to
the
employer.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
sir
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
because
minnesota
has
imposed
this
pension
funding
charge
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
or
it
is
a
condition.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
do
not
think
a
conditional
right
to
cancel
it.
i
think
they
have
destroyed
the
right
to
cancel.
you
say
they
have
created
an
additional
obligation.
i
phrase
it
and
again,
you
and
i
may
be
engaging
in
semantics,
when
i
have
an
unqualified
right
to
terminate
a
plan
without
further
liability
and
minnesota
says,
you
can
terminate
that
plan
only
if
you
will
pay
more
money.
i
think
they
have
destroyed
my
unlimited
right
of
termination.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
that
would
not
arise
mr.
justice
because
this
act
goes
into
effect
only
when
you
are
closing
a
plan,
so
the
question
of
new
employees
coming
in
cannot
arise
in
minnesota.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
will
have
to
go
off
the
record.
my
colleagues
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
had
such
a
thing
here.
one
of
these
cases
that
they
thought
applied,
employees
were
transferred
and
minnesota
did
not
levy
its
tax.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
sir,
it
is
very
retroactive.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
this
plan
had
an
elaborate
vesting
scheduled
that
was
a
combination
of
years
of
service
plus
age
and
the
minnesota
statute
says
you
have
got
to
fund
your
plan
so
that
all
contributions
made
at
10
years
are
vested.
they
put
in
a
10-year
vesting
period
and
it
is
stringently
retroactive.
it
is
the
equivalent
of
giving
these
employees
a
retroactive
wage
increase.
now,
minnesota
or
the
district
court
make
some
point
which
we
have
endeavored
to
answer
in
our
brief
that
the
employees
anticipated
they
would
get
their
pension.
now,
that
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
below
and
my
brethren
here
is
fanciful.
everyone
goes
on
thinking
he
is
going
to
live
forever,
but
every
man
knows
in
his
heart
that
he
may
not
and
he
buys
an
insurance
policy.
employees
anticipate
and
have
a
right
to
anticipate
pensions
only
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
their
plans.
the
doctrine
created
by
the
district
court
here
which
it
permitted
to
stand
that
people
you
can
invade
and
change
contracts
to
make
them
work
as
someone
may
have
anticipated
they
would
work
would
destroy
contracts
completely.
i
expect
near
lunchtime
and
with
your
permission,
i
will
reserve,
you
go
at
12:30.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
12
o'
clock,
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may?
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
will
answer
any
questions
right
now
if
there
are
any
more
at
the
moment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
briefly
if
i
may
your
honor?
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
this
case
anymore.
i
have
just
heard
counsel
i
think
say
that
a
minimum
wage
made
two
years
retroactive
would
be
unconstitutional.
well,
i
think
i
heard
him
say
earlier
that
they
did
not
think
this
statute
was
retroactive.
i
do
not
see
how
the
two
were
together.
he
certainly,
the
one
thing
we
appear
to
be
in
agreement
on
is
that
contributions
to
a
pension
plan
are
a
form
of
compensation,
a
form
of
wage,
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
retroactive
wages
are
required
by
the
statute.
now,
i
could
go
on
and
argue,
but
i
do
not
think
i
could
make
the
matter
any
clearer
than
i
have
with
that
blunt
assertion.
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
talk
about
the
line
of
distinction
that
counsel
would
draw
between
bargain
plans
and
unbargained
plans.
these
contracts,
it
seems
to
us
are
as
binding
upon
the
employer
as
a
one
bargained
out
with
a
labor
union
and
so
long
as
that
plan
was
in
effect
and
about
this
there
can
be
no
doubt,
if
the
company
failed
to
make
the
required
contributions
to
it
each
year,
the
employer
could
be
sued
by
all
or
any
of
these
employees,
they
were
a
condition
of
this
contract
of
labor
or
employment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
it
would
be
a
contract
suit,
a
suit
on
the
contract.
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
dealt
with
a
subset
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
speaking
â€¦
mr.
george
b.
christensen
there
was
a
question
at
noon
what
was
impaired
here,
specifically
there
was
the
right
to
terminate
the
plan
without
penalty
and
upon
termination
of
the
plan
whatever
rights
any
employee
had
were
fully
vested.
now,
under
the
plan
they
would
not
all
get
money,
if
there
was
not
money
there,
but
if
this
had
been
an
enormously
successful
plan,
if
we
assume
that
the
funds
had
been
invested
by
trustees
in
some
wildly
successful
speculated
venture,
it
very
well
might
be
that
everyone
would
have
been
paid
in
full
and
if
in
the
unlikely
circumstance,
there
would
be
a
surplus
then
the
company
would
get
it,
but
there
would
have
been
no
forfeiture
of
any
kind.
the
plan
further
provided
that
benefits
are
payable
only
out
of
the
trust.
now,
minnesota
converted
that,
although
we
declared
this
trust,
a
corporate
employer
declared
the
trust,
the
party
did
the
trust
of
course,
they
made
that
a
direct
corporate
obligation.
i
cannot
imagine
anymore
direct
increasing
of
the
burdens
and
that
has
been
held
in
over
noon
hour
i
have
been
informed
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
the
detroit
railway
case
which
was
sometime
in
the
teens
or
20s,
this
court
has
held
that
adding
to
the
burdens
of
a
contract
impairs
the
contract.
i
have
seen
other
cases
in
my
research
in
this
thing,
but
i
cannot
recite
them
to
the
court
right
now
i
am
sorry
to
say.
the
presentation
that
has
been
made
orally
is
so
different
from
the
presentation
made
in
the
brief.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
yes
they
can,
assuming
that
meets
due
process
as
you
do
with
minimum
wages.
they
cut
right
through
the
fair
labor
standards.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
you
said
form
the
state
view.
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
federal
government.
no
sir,
a
state
could
not
do
it.
no
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
what
becomes
the
$4.00
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
christensen
so
you
increase
the
wage?
i
think
the
answer
is
the
same.
i
would
answer
that
question
no,
the
statement
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
in
my
judgment,
no.
i
think
the
individually
made
contract
is
just
as
sacred
and
immune
to
state
impairment
as
a
collective
bargained
type.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
if
you
had
no
contract
then
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
that
would
violate
the
obligation
of
contract.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
then
i
think
you
have
a
different
question.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
then
you
have
a
different
question.
that
is
all
i
have,
thank
you
for
your
attention.
