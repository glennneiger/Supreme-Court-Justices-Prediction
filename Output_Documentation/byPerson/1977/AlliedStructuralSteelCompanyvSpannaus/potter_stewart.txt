justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
minnesota.
this
is
an
important
case,
both
as
a
matter
of
abstract
constitutional
law
and
as
a
matter
of
practical
impact
and
i
shall
make
only
a
very
brief
oral
announcement
this
morning.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
application
of
minnesota's
private
pension
benefits
protection
act
to
the
appellant
company
violates
the
contract
clause
of
the
constitution.
this
is
the
constitutional
provision
that
was
at
issue
in
the
famous
darmouth
college
case,
argued
here
by
daniel
webster
more
than
a
150
years
ago,
but
it
is
a
constitutional
provision
that
has
been
largely
quiescent
in
this
century.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
we
conclude
that
the
minnesota
law
does
violate
this
provision
of
the
constitution,
accordingly
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case,
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
