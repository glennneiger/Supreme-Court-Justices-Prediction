william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
patent
regulation,
you
mean
pension?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
christensen,
i
suppose
in
the
strictly
technical
sense,
there
is
not
an
impairment
of
contract
in
so
far
as
allied
is
concerned
here
in
the
sense
that
a
contractual
expectation
that
it
had
was
taken
away
from
it.
very
likely,
the
sense
of
the
provision
is
involved,
but
do
you
not
ordinary
think
of
impairment
of
the
obligation
or
contract
as
thinking
you
had
a
right
to
receive
something
under
a
contract
and
then
the
state
says
no,
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
receive
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
the
federal
government
is
not
bound
by
the
retirement
clause
the
way
the
states
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
starns,
are
you
saying
there
has
been
no
impairment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
read
that
the
district
courtâ€™s
opinion
that
say
you
in
effect
conceded
there
was
impairment,
but
that
was
justifiable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
starns,
do
you
have
any
off
hand
top
of
the
head
knowledge
as
to
how
many
bargained
for
employees
would
be
covered
by
this
and
how
many
nonbargained
for
employees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
we
were
to
decide
it
just
on
the
basis
of
this,
this
was
a
nonbargained
for
pension
plan,
we
would
leave
undecided,
i
take
it,
if
our
decision
applied
only
to
those
facts,
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
to
whom
the
plan
applied?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
point
of
constitution
or
your
retroactivity
argument
directed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
specific
prohibition
in
the
constitution
against
the
enactment
of
retroactive
laws,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
saying
in
effect
is
you
can
impair
so
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned,
but
not
so
far
as
the
employee
is
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
minnesota
legislature
had
decided
that
most
minnesota
manufacturing
companies
had
put
much
too
much
money
into
pension
funding
for
their
financial
stability,
and
therefore,
it
was
of
great
importance
to
the
state
to
enable
them
to
reduce
these
commitments,
and
therefore,
it
adopted
the
provision
that
justice
white
proposed
to
you.
do
you
think
that
would
be
impairment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
state
passed
a
minimum
wage
statute
and
said
it
is
to
be
effective
as
of
two
years
ago,
any
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
a
state
do
it
perspectively?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
if
a
state
were
to
say
for
every
employee
you
hire
from
now
on,
you
will
have
to
pay
him
$4.00
per
hour?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever
the
employee
wants
i
suppose?
