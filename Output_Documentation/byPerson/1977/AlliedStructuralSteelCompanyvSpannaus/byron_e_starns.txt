mr.
byron
e.
starns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
minnesota
act
applies
in
two
situations,
a
planned
termination
by
an
employer
and
a
plant
closing.
this
case
involves
the
closing
of
a
plant,
not
a
plan
termination.
i
think
that
point
should
be
clarified.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no
your
honor,
the
plan
is
still
in
effect
as
of
this
date.
it
has
been
amended
twice
by
the
company
to
freeze
the
benefit
levels
and
to
freeze
the
ability
of
anyone
to
get
into
the
plan
in
the
future
and
the
amounts
have
been
vested
with
respect
to
the
people
covered
by
the
plan
prior
to
those
amendments.
our
position,
your
honors
is,
the
heart
of
appellant’s
argument
is
that
the
situation
addressed
by
the
pension
act
was
a
subject
of
a
preenactment
contract
and
that
as
applied
allied,
the
act
has
changed
those
established
contractual
rights.
to
the
contrary,
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
established
contract
between
allied
and
its
minnesota
workers
with
respect
to
their
earned
interest
in
the
pension
benefits
based
upon
the
circumstance
of
a
plant
shutdown
and
further
that
the
act
is
not
retroactive
in
effect
since
no
preenactment
established
contractual
rights
are
affected.
now,
i
think
this
can
be
illustrated
by
examining
the
nature
of
the
contractual
relationships
we
are
dealing
with
here.
the
creation
of
a
pension
plan
constitutes
an
unilateral
offer
by
the
employer
which
is
subject
to
the
acceptance
by
the
employee
and
that
acceptance
is
only
complete
when
he
has
satisfied
both
the
length
of
service
requirements
and
the
attainment
of
the
minimum
age
requirement.
so
that
we
have
no
fully
completed
contract
in
the
context
of
this
case
since
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
have
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
that
is
the
sense
of
our
argument.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
your
honor,
i
think
i
could
clarify
that
point.
i
think
the
district
court
has
said
that
the
state
seems
to
concede
that
there
has
been
no
impairment.
the
only
statement
in
the
record
below
was
a
statement
in
our
pretrial
brief
on
the
summery
judgment
aspects
of
the
case
where
we
stated
that
if
to
the
extent
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess,
the
state
was
arguing
about
the
contractual
relationship
involved
in
this
particular
case.
i
thought
that
a
brief
recitation
of
the
procedural
history
relating
to
this
point
might
be
in
order
to
help
clarify
the
position
before
the
court.
the
challenge
was
brought
by
allied
steel
in
district
court
to
the
application
of
the
state
statute
here
in
question.
as
a
result
of
that
action,
the
state
ultimately
filed
a
motion
for
the
federal
district
court
to
abstain
in
order
that
the
state
courts
could
construe
the
null
and
void
provision
of
the
act
which
is
the
final
section
of
the
act.
at
the
same
time,
there
was
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
brought
by
allied
steel.
in
the
context
of
that
motion,
we
filed
a
brief
in
june
of
1976
which
stated
that
to
the
extent
that
the
pension
plan
allowed
allied
to
cause
a
forfeiture
of
the
accrued
benefits
for
those
not
qualified
under
the
plan,
there
might
be
impairment.
of
course,
subsequent
to
that
brief,
there
was
an
argument
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
both
motions,
certified
instead
of
abstaining
on
the
question
of
interpretation
of
state
law,
certified
that
to
the
minnesota
state
supreme
court
appoint
a
special
master
to
find
fact.
the
special
master
found
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
pension
plan
as
originally
adopted
does
not
take
into
account
a
plant
shutdown
as
one
of
the
conditions
for
the
actuarial
calculations
associated
with
those
findings
of
fact
were
stipulated
to
by
all
the
parties
and
in
constitute
findings
of
fact
in
this
case.
so
in
any
event,
we
think
that
there
is
before
the
court,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
impairment
to
this
contract.
now,
the
relevance
of
the
impairment
issue
of
course
goes
to
the
reasonableness
test
under
the
united
states
trust
and
extent
of
impairment.
our
point
is
that
it
is
established
that
a
pension
plan
constitutes
a
unilateral
offer
by
the
employer
to
the
employee
of
the
form
of
the
differed
compensation.
the
law
is
and
the
appellants
have
admitted
that
employer
contributions
constitute
a
form
of
compensation.
however,
the
cases
have
held
that
an
employee
is
not
entitled
to
receive
that
form
of
differed
compensation
or
any
part
thereof
unless
he
has
satisfied
the
eligibility
requirements
to
the
plan
and
those
eligibility
requirements
are
typically
the
attainment
of
a
minimum
age
and
the
service
for
a
minimum
period
of
time
whatever
it
might
be
under
the
particular
plan.
consequently
in
such
a
situation,
we
submit
that
if
there
is
no
contract
for
the
employees
benefit
to
have
enforced
in
this
situation,
there
can
be
none
to
be
impaired.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
that
argument
might
not
be
made
in
that
context.
the
act
does
not
affect
the
subject
of
preenactment
bargaining,
much
less
agreement
in
our
opinion
also
and
that
takes
it
out
of
the
scope
of
retroactivity
in
our
opinion.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes,
i
am
only
taking
about
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
right,
i
think
that
of
course
whether
or
not
there
is
an
impairment,
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
retroactive
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
valid
police
power
enactment
is
constitutional.
i
think
that
for
all
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
this
law
would
be
constitutional
whether
or
not
it
applied
to
a
collectively
bargained
or
noncollectively
bargained
plan.
i
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
plans
would
relate
to
what
the
expectations
of
the
parties
are
and
of
course
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
this
court
has
identified
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
determining
the
extent
of
impairment
and
of
course,
i
think
that
in
examining
expectations
to
parties,
the
nature
of
the
contractual
relationship
is
an
important
factor.
it
may
impact
upon
the
breadth
with
which
the
court
can
go
outside
the
document
itself.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
the
number
of
minnesota
people
is
limited.
the
vast
majority
are
the
subjects
of
collectively
bargained
contracts.
the
white
case
is
1,200
people
i
believe.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
might
be
the
result
of
your
decision
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
basis
for
indecision.
if
it
was
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
contractual
nature
of
the
relationship,
yes.
if
it
was
based
upon
the
police
power
analysis
and
the
complete
analysis
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
that
is
correct.
minnesota
supreme
court
held
that
the
act
was
preempted
by
erisa
effective
january
1975
and
the
plan
years
to
which
the
erisa
language
applies.
however,
i
think
that
there
may
be
applications
in
the
future
depending
upon
what
the
fact
situation
is.
i
admit
that
they
are
limited
and
it
may
be
nonexistent,
but
there
conceivably
could
be
some
application
of
the
act
in
the
future.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
to
a
bargained
for
and
a
nonbargained
for
plan.
now,
the
state’s
position
is
also
that
the
statute
is
not
retroactive
in
effect.
the
express
language
of
the
pension
plan
itself
indicates
that
there
was
no
meaning
in
the
minds
on
the
plant
shutdown
situation.
for
example,
the
length
of
service
for
vesting
under
the
pension
plan
is
a
lengthy
period
of
time,
20
years.
secondly,
there
is
an
expressed
covenant
not
to
compete
in
the
plan.
it
seems
to
use
that
this
implies
that
the
person
reading
that
document
could
anticipate
that
the
plan
would
continue
in
existence
and
the
plan
would
continue
in
operation
for
at
least
the
minimum
period
of
vesting,
20
years
plus
the
lengthy
period
of
time
thereafter
since
retirees
would
forfeit
their
benefits
if
they
engaged
in
competition
with
the
company.
that
presumes
a
continuing
enterprise.
we
note
the
court
below
took
special
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
companies
actuaries
did
not
take
into
account
the
plant
shutdown
and
judge
haney
noted
that
the
argument
on
the
merits
that
in
light
of
that
fact,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
you
really
have
an
impairment
of
contract.
now,
the
act
is
also
not
retroactive
in
our
opinion
because
it
applies
to
transactions
which
are
completed
after
its
day
of
enactment.
generally
a
law
is
retroactive
or
considered
retroactive
for
constitutional
purposes
if
it
reaches
back
to
alter
already
completed
transactions.
here,
the
triggering
event
of
the
statute
occurs
after
its
effective
date.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
that
would
be
essentially
a
due
process
argument
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no,
and
i
think
i
am
trying
to
address
the
points
raised
by
appellants
in
their
brief.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no
your
honor.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
it
is
if
you
construe
it
in
that
way
your
honor.
the
only
relevance
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
impairment
would
go
to
the
degree
of
impairment
analysis
under
the
contract
clause.
now,
we
do
not
quarrel
that
the
results
of
the
statute
has
been
to
change
the
overall
employment
agreements
involving
these
employees.
the
court
below
in
a
footnote
i
think
at
page
890
of
the
appendix
noted
that
employment
agreement
includes
the
wage
agreement,
the
pension
plan,
and
any
other
fringed
benefits.
now,
our
understanding
is
that
the
contract
clause
issue
raised
by
the
appellants
relate
solely
to
the
pension
plan
and
in
the
context
of
that
argument
i
think
our
point
that
there
is
really
no
contract
there
is
relevant.
however,
if
the
court
is
going
to
view
the
entire
employment
agreement
as
a
contract
then
i
think
these
arguments
are
relevant
to
the
matter
before
the
court
as
are
the
retroactivity
arguments.
our
position
is
also
that
the
act
is
not
retroactive
because
there
is
no
change
in
the
benefit
levels
provided
by
the
plan,
and
therefore,
it
does
not
impair
the
contract
itself.
as
a
general
matter,
the
act
is
tied
to
the
specific
benefit
levels
that
are
provided
by
the
plan
to
which
it
applies.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
allied
plan
itself
would
provide
more
liberal
benefits
in
a
plan
termination
situation
than
our
act
requires.
if
you
look
at
the
termination
article
of
that
pension
plan,
it
states
that
if
when
the
plan
is
terminated
all
covered
employees
have
a
right
to
their
earned
interest
in
their
pension
plan.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes,
it
will
cost
them
some
more
money
and
our
position
is
that
the
money
that
it
cost
them
is
in
the
form
of
the
wages
that
they
have
owing
to
the
employees
for
the
work
rendered
up
to
this
point
because
they
admit
that
the
pension
benefits
are
wages
and
so
from
that
point
of
view
the
statute
really
becomes
a
form
of
waging
our
protection
really.
it
is
not
a
retroactive
wage
increase.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
good
point
in
terms
of
logical
consistency,
but
unfortunately
the
decisions
hold
otherwise.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
they
hold
that
the
employees
cannot
enforce
any
quasi
contractual
obligation.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes,
but
our
point
is
it
does
not
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
our
point
your
honor
is
that
it
is
not
a
new
obligation.
it
maybe
somewhat
different.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
i
am
not
so
sure.
i
think
that
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes,
there
is
the
difference
between
what
maybe
left
in
the
balance
of
the
plan
upon
termination.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
the
obligation
to
pay
came
into
being
i
think
with
the
passage
of
the
law.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
that
the
obligation
is
not
new
in
terms
of
the
expectations
to
the
parties.
it
maybe
new
in
terms
of
the
expressed
language
of
the
agreements,
but
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
contract
laws
one
of
the
things
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
studying
the
reasonableness
of
the
legislation
that
is
being
challenged
is
the
extent
to
which
it
promotes
rather
than
under
cuts
the
original
expectations
of
the
guardians.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
there
might
be
a
problem
with
that
and
of
course
of
our
act
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
our
act
does
not
have
any
effect
upon
the
vested,
the
funds
and
the
trust.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
i
think
your
honor
in
the
context
of
this
case,
if
we
analyze
what
the
expectation
of
the
parties
are,
the
employer
has
in
effect
created
an
impossibility
situation
for
performance
by
the
employee.
in
other
words,
he
has
reneged
on
his
expectation
that
he
would
achieve
as
a
result
of
this
plan,
continuity
of
employment.
he
has
voluntarily
reneged
on
that
and
the
person
that
suffers
is
the
employee
who
is
denied
the
continuing
opportunity
to
qualify
for
a
pension.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
he
is
reneged
by
removing
the
workplace
as
a
place
to
work
and
he
has
made
that
decision
consciously
for
business
reasons
or
whatever,
but
it
seems
to
be
in
terms
of
its
original
underlying
bargain,
it
was
that
the
employer
expected
to
get
out
his
pension
plan,
continuity
of
employment,
it
would
help
his
situation
in
terms
of
the
competition
for
labor.
he
expected
presumably
to
get
some
decrease
in
wage
demands
because
it
is
a
form
of
compensation.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
the
basis
would
be
your
honor
the
express
language
to
plan
which
i
noted
earlier
that
contains
a
covenant
not
to
compete
for
example
which
would
seem
to
make
no
sense.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no
your
honor.
i
would
read
it
as
an
indication
of
what
are
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
parties
to
this
original
agreement
and
i
think
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
the
court,
the
expectations
of
the
parties
are
an
important
factor
in
determining
the
degree
of
infringement,
and
therefore,
whether
a
statute
has
violated
a
contract
clause.
now,
that
is
assuming
we
have
a
contract,
we
are
already
beyond
the
initial
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
i
think
that
is
true
and
our
point
is
that
the
original
contract
is
at
best
ambiguous
on
this
point.
it
does
not
address
the
point
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
under
the
allied
pension
plan
every
employee
could
get
a
share
if
the
plan
were
fully
funded.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no,
he
cannot
get
anything
out
because
i
think
the
original
expectations
of
the
party
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
only
if
he
meets
the
two
conditions
for
vesting
and
that
those
are
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
this
does
not
involve
an
employee
contribution.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
that
is
correct.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
except
that
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
there
is
one
provision
in
the
plan
that
if
there
is
an
excess
after
the
money
has
been
distributed,
it
does
go
back
to
the
employee,
it
is
a
minor
point,
but
there
is
the
possibility
to
receive
money
back.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
yes
sir.
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
case
though
your
honor
that
the
way
this
would
work
is
a
windfall
to
the
employer.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
that
maybe
the
case
your
honor.
i
think
we
are
talking
about
what
the
public
purpose
of
this
statute
is
the
first
benchmark
of
analysis,
what
is
the
public
purpose?
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
it
may
not,
if
the
court
were
to
accept
those
situations
as
constituting
a
sufficient
fact
for
public
purpose.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
i
think
that
is
what
the
doctrine
and
the
teaching
of
these
courts
decisions
are
is
that
you
can
impair
contracts,
you
can
enact
retroactive
laws.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
of
course
full
funding
of
plans
is
what
erisa
is
all
about.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
correct.
well,
i
think
that
if
you
judge
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
it
is
an
added
benefit
and
i
think
that
if
you
treat
this
retirement
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor
because
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
minimum
wage
type
protection
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
the
pension
benefits
are
form
of
compensation.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
we
have
recognized
by
our
decisions
that
deferred
pension
rights
are
a
form
of
compensation
so
to
that
extent
the
employee
has
an
accrued
or
in
coed
right
to
the
amount
that
he
has
earned
in
those
pension
benefits.
that
is
not
the
same
as
changing
a
$5.00
an
hour
contract
or
a
$6.00
an
hour
contract
and
relating
it
back.
mr.
byron
e.
starns
i
assume
if
there
was
a
specific
contract
--
mr.
byron
e.
starns
well,
it
would
probably
be
as
well
a
due
process
point
your
honor
like
the
assary
case
which
involved
the
black
loan
benefits
and
the
retroactive
requirement
of
payment
of
those
benefits
for
employees
who
were
terminated
prior
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
i
think
that
it
is
very
similar
example
you
pose
is
very
similar
to
that
one.
as
we
stated
even
if
it
is
found
that
there
is
contract
impairment
here
the
act
is
not
unconstitutional.
public
purpose
to
protect
the
employees'
accrued
interest
and
the
pension
rights
to
establish
full
funding
of
pension
plans
is
clear.
erisa
is
a
monument
to
that
fact.
it
is
reasonable,
judged
by
the
extent
of
impairment
and
is
necessary
judged
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
us
trust
case.
that
completes
my
argument,
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
