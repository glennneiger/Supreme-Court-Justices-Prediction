you
think
the
state
could
if
a
company
had
no
bargained
for
plan
or
no
voluntary
plan,
you
think
a
state
statute
could
require
the
company
to
adopt
a
statutory
type
plan?
suppose
in
the
statute
they
had
a
formula,
a
pattern
and
they
just
required
all
companies
to
start
putting
their
money
into
these
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
christensen,
in
your
argument,
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
it
was
for
the
future
of
the
payouts,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
christensen,
are
there
not
really
two
parts
to
the
retroactive
aspect
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquistâ€™s
question
brought
this
to
mind.
on
the
one
hand
you
have
to
put
more
money
into
the
fund,
you
come
up
with
more
and
secondly,
you
are
prevented
from
getting
back
that
which
you
would
have
been
able
to
recover
over
and
above
the
vested
rights
of
those
who
are
entitled
to
some
money
that
i
take
it
were
in
the
surplus
that
under
the
contract,
you
would
have
had
the
right
to
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
terminate
the
plan
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
are
asserting
that
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
pointed
out
that
the
contractual
right
to
terminate
the
plan
had
been
impaired.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
did
that
hurt
you
then
if
all
the
money
was
in
there
to
stay
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
the
requirement
that
you
put
more
money
into
the
pot
that
hurts
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
not
an
impairment
of
an
existing
obligation.
that
is
a
creation
of
a
new
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
that,
well,
they
have
impaired
our
right
to
cancel
the
plan,
now
how
did
that
hurt
you,
the
no
longer
being
able
to
cancel
the
plan?
i
thought
that
meant
that
you
would
have
gotten
some
money
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
state
prevent
you
from
terminating
the
plan
with
respect
to
any
newly
hired
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
employees
transferred
to
another
plan?
they
have
to
go
on
paying
for
them
if
you
do
not
want
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
alright.
you
carry
on
the
way
you
want.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
ahead,
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
not
be
able
to
make
this
argument
in
the
bargained
for
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
the
employer
cannot
get
his
money
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
deny
the
employee
with
vested
rights
for
a
good
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
there
be
a
difference
between
the
situation
that
i
gave
you
in
the
law
which
instead
of
doing
what
i
suggested,
it
said
to
the
employer
you
must
now
double
your
contributions
to
the
pension
fund
despite
what
your
bargain
for
contract
was
or
your
voluntary
contract
with
your
own
employees,
you
must
now
fully
fund
your
plans
and
you
must
double,
allied
you
must
double
your
payments
to
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
that
certainly
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
his
contract
with
his
employees.
he
has
promised
them
only
to
put
in
x
and
now
it
is
2x?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
an
impairment,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
that
do
you
need
even
to
go
through
any
impairment
analysis?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
your
answer
to
brother
rehnquist,
do
you
mean
it
would
be
an
impairment
or
would
it
be
a
due
process
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
employer
has
just
promised
to
pay
him
and
he
had
paid
him
when
had
promised
to
pay
him,
$10.00
an
hour
and
now
the
legislature
comes
along
and
says
we
think
you
should
have
been
paying
him
$15.00
an
hour
and
further
more
you
should
have
been
paying
him
that
for
the
last
two
years
so
pay
it
to
him,
is
that
an
impairment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
an
employer
and
a
union
have
effective
bargaining
contract
that
will
last
the
next
three
years
that
the
legislature
cannot
require
the
payment
of
a
higher
wage
than
specified
in
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
adding
to
the
burden
of
a
contract
making
the
employer
pay
more
than
he
ever
promised
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
an
impairment?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
balance
that
contract
term,
you
said
that
the
contract
has
got
three
years
to
run
and
the
state
legislature
says
for
the
next
two
years
you
must
double
the
pay
into
the
contract?
