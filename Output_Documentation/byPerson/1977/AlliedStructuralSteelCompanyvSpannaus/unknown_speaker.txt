unknown
speaker
was
this
a
bargained
for
plan?
unknown
speaker
mr.
starns,
when
you
say
it
does
not
affect
the
subject
of
preenactment,
it
maybe
not
in
this
case,
but
does
not
the
statute
apply
to
bargained
contracts?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
as
to
its
constitutionality
as
to
bargained
contracts
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
said
it
is
not
even
an
impairment
of
contract
here?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
contractual
argument
so
i
guess
you
will
get
to
the
other
one?
unknown
speaker
but
also
it
is
limited
in
the
sense
that
there
have
not
been
too
many,
i
do
not
suppose
too
many
instances
for
you
to
apply
the
plan?
between
the
time
it
went
into
effect
into
the
act,
and
between
the
time
it
went
into
effect
and
the
time
that
i
has
been
preempted
by
erisa?
unknown
speaker
to
a
bargained
for
plan?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
starns
may
i
ask
the
only
question
that
is
presented
in
jurisdictional
statement,
even
as
rephrased
in
your
brief
is
contract
close
question.
do
we
have
anything
else
to
decide
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
discussion
of
due
process
police
powers
of
that
rather
relevant
to
the
question
presented?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
in
the
facts
of
this
case
it
is
going
to
cost
the
company
more
money
to
close
down
its
plant
then
it
would
have
it
if
they
act
and
then
pass,
for
that
moment?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
starns,
if
that
argument
is
valid
you
did
not
need
the
statute,
they
already
owe
the
money?
unknown
speaker
so
they
did
not
owe
the
money
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
do
you
not
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
statute
is
the
source
of
the
company’s
obligation
to
pay
higher
wages?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
not
imposed
in
a
new
obligation,
a
new
and
different
wage
obligation
than
existed
before?
unknown
speaker
it
is
with
everyone…
unknown
speaker
well,
the
difference
between
0
and
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
decide
which
party’s
expectation
you
are
going
to
look
at?
it
is
the
same
expectation
from
the
employees,
but
different
from
the
employer
and
if
you
are
looking
at
it
that
way,
supposing
there
had
not
been
enough
money
in
the
company
and
the
legislature
decided
the
only
way
to
satisfy
the
expectations
of
the
junior
employees
would
be
to
take
some
of
the
vested
compensation
away
from
the
senior
employees
on
the
ground
that
they
have
been
overpaid
over
the
years
and
they
are
going
to
get
social
security
anyway
and
so
forth
and
their
expectations
will
be
frustrated,
but
the
juniors
would
be
fulfilled,
could
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
difference
as
far
as
the
impairment
contract
clause
is
concerned
whether
it
is
an
employer
or
a
group
of
old
employees
that
is
affected
by,
what
is
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
has
been
paying
into
a
pension
plan
for
10
years
and
there
were
100
employees
that
have
come
at
different
terms.
at
the
end
of
the
ten
years,
let's
assume
there
is
vesting
in
ten
years,
some
have
vested
and
some
have
not.
can
he
terminate,
if
he
terminates
the
plan
then
under
this
particular
contract,
can
he
get
all
the
money
back
out
of
the
fund
that
he
has
been
paying
in
or
any?
unknown
speaker
alright.
i
know,
but
he
has
been
paying
for
10
years
and
he
just
wants
to
quit
and
so
he
quits,
he
terminates
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
under
this
plan
then
there
is
a
contract
with
the
employees
to
the
extent
that
he
has
paid
into
a
fund?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
cannot
get
his
money
back
if
he
terminates
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
so
what
he
pays
into
the
fund
it
is
gone
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
whether
he
terminates
the
plan
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
of
minnesota
could
say
that
is
to
say
that
the
employer
may
terminate
and
get
his
money
back?
unknown
speaker
because
that
would
be
an
impairment?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
a
suit
in
a
subset
under
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
illinois
subset.
unknown
speaker
oh!
good,
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
too.
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
a
difference
if
there
were
or
were
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
representative
of
his
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
my
brother
rehnquist's
case
you
would
not
have
individual
contracts
with
future
employees,
you
would
hire
them
only
after
the
state
had
enacted
the
statute
requiring
a
minimum
per
hour
pay
of
$4.00?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
not
because
by
definition
he
is
a
new
employee.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
the
contract
of
the
union
that
says
we
will
pay
$3
and
the
union
says
fine
and
it
is
a
union
shop
so
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
there
is
that
a
promise
to
pay
only
$3.00
and
the
state
says
sorry,
but
you
must
pay
$4.
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
there
were
no
collective
bargain
agreement
and
the
statute
applied
only
to
future
employees,
employess
subsequently
hired
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
do,
do
you
not?
