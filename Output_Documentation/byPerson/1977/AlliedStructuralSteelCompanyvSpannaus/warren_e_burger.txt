chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
fleck
against
spannaus.
mr.
christensen,
i
think
you
may
now
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
name
of
the
case
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
should
change
that
to,
what
is
the
correction
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
mine,
it
appears
as
365.
it
should
be
365.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
between
us,
we
will
get
it
straightened
out.
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
had
imposed
the
new
obligations,
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
very
far
away
from
what
the
social
security
act
as
mr.
justice
whiteâ€™s
suggestion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
also
suggesting
that
a
state
could
not
have
adopted
what
is
essentially
the
social
security
statute,
independent
of
federal
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
clear
that
this
act
requires
the
employer
to
pay
some
money
for
an
earlier
period.
it
is
retroactive
in
that
sense,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
it
is
not
just
altering
an
existing
contract
with
respect
to
the
future,
you
say?
it
requires
a
deposit,
a
payment
covering
a
period
that
is
already
lapsed
before
the
statute
was
passed.
chief
justice
warren

12
o'
clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
starns.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
the
plan
being
terminated
because
the
plant
is
closing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00[recess]
mr.
starns,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
obligation
come
into
being?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
have
you
not
just
contradicted
yourself.
you
said
it
was
not
new.
if
it
came
into
being
with
the
passage
of
the
law
then
it
is
new,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
say
he
is
voluntary
renamed,
what
specific
do
you
rely
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
basis
for
any
expectation
that
this
company
was
going
to
stay
in
minnesota
forever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
you
would
read
that
as
a
contract
to
continue
to
do
business
in
minnesota
in
perpetuity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
would
the
employer
have
any
expectation
other
than
his
contract
was
to
be
executed
exactly
as
it
was
originally
drafted
until
it
was
changed
with
his
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
christensen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-747,
allied
structural
steel
company
against
spannaus,
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.

justice
