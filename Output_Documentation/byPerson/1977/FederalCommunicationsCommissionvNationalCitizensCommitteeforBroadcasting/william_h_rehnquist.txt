justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
that
commission
saw
its
source
of
authority
to
require
diversity
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
about
the
same
thing
in
buckley
against
valeo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
a
weight
can
we
attribute
to
what
the
1952
congress
thought
as
to
what
the
1934
congress
amended?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
if
we
are
talking
about
rules,
why
is
there
need
to
be
any
reference
to
a
record?
the
commission
can
make
a
rule
without
having
any
record
before
it,
can
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
based
on
congress’
authority
over
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
federal
communications
commission
had
turned
down
the
united
states'
motion
to
intervene,
do
you
think
they
would
still
have
any
standing
to
challenge
anything
in
the
court
of
appeals
other
than
the
commission’s
denial
of
motion
to
intervene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
position
i
take
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white
is
that,
since
the
commission
allowed
them
to
intervene
just
like
they
allowed
a
number
of
private
groups
to
intervene,
they
have
at
least
the
standing
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
a
minute
counsel.
it
is
one
thing,
is
it
not,
to
say
that
you
may
come
here
only
with
permission
of
the
solicitor
general
and
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general
may
come
here
regardless
of
any
statutory
of
authorization
just
because
he
feels
like
coming?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
are
you
not
ordinarily
expected
to
uphold
the
act
of
congress
that
is
challenged
under
that
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
that
that
is
one
of
the
authorities
by
which
you
were
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment.
you
are
now
arguing
against
the
commission’s
grandfathering
provision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
are
saying
that
there
were
examples
before
to
which
it
was
entitled
to
give
weight?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
does
not
make
sense
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
make
a
stronger
case
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
was
entitled
to
give
weight
then
it
is
not
entitled
to
give
weight.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
need
any
sort
of
evidence
in
a
rule
making
procedure,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
not
the
commission
presume
to
have
some
confidence
and
expertise
which
can
supply
that
rational
ground
just
patently
fallacious?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
quite
different
than
saying
it
is
not
supported
by
substantial
record
concerns,
substantial
evidence.
a
renewal
survive
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
without
it
and
all
that
the
evidence
includes
for
the
commission,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
not
the
commission's
reliance
here
supersedes
whatever
they
said
in
1965?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
every
agency
when
it
changes
it
might
have
to
get
out
all
of
its
other
inconsistent
statements
that
were
made
over
last
40
years,
we
would
never
adjourn
for
the
summer?[laughter]
