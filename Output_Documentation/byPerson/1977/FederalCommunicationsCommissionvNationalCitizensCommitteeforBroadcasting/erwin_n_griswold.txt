mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
there
are
many
parties
and
several
issues.
all
arise
out
of
the
ownership
of
a
newspaper
and
of
a
broadcast
facility,
television
or
radio,
in
the
same
community
by
the
same
interest.
in
the
terms
of
the
trade,
this
is
known
as
cross-ownership.
the
issues
here
result
from
an
order
of
the
federal
communications
commission
made
in
1975
after
five
years
of
hearings.
this
was
a
rule
making
proceeding
and
the
result
is
known
as
the
commission’s
second
report
and
order.
it
occupies
most
of
the
first
volume
of
the
appendix
from
pages
134
to
338.
the
ruling
announced
by
the
commission
was
that
it
would
not
hear
after
grant
a
new
broadcast
license
or
transfer
of
license
where
there
was
cross-ownership.
this
is
known
as
the
prospective
rule,
but
the
commission
also
determined
that
it
would
not
apply
this
rule
retroactively.
that
is,
that
it
would
not
refuse
to
renew
existing
licenses
solely
on
the
ground
of
cross-ownership.
this
is
known
as
the
grandfather
provision
of
the
rule.
there
was
however
an
exemption
to
the
grandfather
rule.
in
sixteen
small
market
situations,
where
there
was
no
other
newspaper
and
no
other
comparable
broadcast
facility,
the
commission
did
apply
its
new
rule
to
existing
licensees.
it
said
that
they
must
divest
either
the
newspaper
or
the
broadcast
facility
by
1980.
numerous
appeals
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
columbia.
the
federal
communications
commission
naturally
defended
its
order,
but
the
department
of
justice
attacked
it,
the
government
speaking
with
many
voices,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
grandfather
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
last
march
affirmed
the
prospective
order,
but
it
found
that
the
grandfather
provision
was
invalid
because
it
said
it
was
not
rational.
it
held
that
because
of
a
compelling
presumption
and
that
is
the
court’s
words,
in
favor
of
diversity,
“divestiture
is
required
accept
in
those
cases
where
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
cross-ownership
is
in
the
public
interest.
under
the
judgment
of
the
court,
those
portions
of
the
orders
that
have
retroactive
effect
and
those
portions
dealing
with
existing
combinations
are
vacated
and
the
record
is
remanded
to
the
commission
for
adoption
rules
not
in
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.”
in
this
court,
there
are
widely
divergent
interests.
i
represent
the
private
parties;
newspapers
and
broadcast
stations
and
the
american
news
paper
publishers
associations
and
the
national
association
of
broadcasters.
some
of
my
clients
are
concerned
with
the
perspective
rule
and
others
are
primarily
concerned
with
the
grandfather
question.
i
am
also
appearing
for
the
small
market
situations
and
also
for
some
newspaper
radio
combinations
which
seem
to
be
at
some
risk
of
being
lost
in
the
shuffle.
i
now
turn
to
the
validity
of
the
prospective
rule.
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
here.
the
petitioners,
newspapers
and
broadcast
stations
are
subjected
to
blanket
exclusion
from
commission
licensing
merely
because
they
engage
in
publishing.
the
government
may
not
condition
the
grant
of
a
privilege
on
the
forfeiture
of
a
constitutional
right,
as
in
effect
this
court
held
in
the
simmons
case
some
ten
years
ago
in
a
different
context.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
would
certainly
be
a
ground
to
be
taken
into
account
along
with
all
the
other
factors
in
determining
whether
the
license
should
be
renewed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
something
which
says,
this
is
merely
a
ground
to
be
taken
into
account
with
all
the
other
factors.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
blanket
rule
which
says
that
if
you
are
in
common
ownership
with
a
newspaper,
you
cannot
receive
a
license.
now,
whether
you
get
a
renewal
or
not
is
the
question
of
the
grandfather
rule
which
is
the
next
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
would
be
precise
of
this
case,
that
would
be
announcing
a
rule
that
indicates
of
cross-ownership,
there
cannot
be
a
renewal
and
that
i
suggest
is
contrary
to
a
constitutional
provision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
antitrust
laws
is
clearly
applied
to
newspapers
and
to
television
and
then
in
any
event
where
there
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
there
was
in
the
lorain
journal
case,
which
came
from
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
can
proceed
under
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
not
be
as
the
lorain
journal
case
shows.
it
is
not
just
that
it
is
another
newspaper.
it
is
the
actual
anticompetitive
effect
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
in
the
news
business.
in
the
lorain
journal
case
for
example
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
it
is
a
different,
it
seems
to
me
between
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
influence
or
weight
to
be
given
to
anticompetitive
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
concede
that
the
anticompetitive
effect
can
be
taken
into
account
along
with
all
other
factors
in
determining
whether
a
license
should
be
granted
or
should
be
renewed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice.
there
are
many
cities
in
this
country
which
have
only
one
newspaper.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
know
nothing
to
indicate
that
that
violates
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
even
though
it
does
violate
the
anti
trust
laws
and
i
know
of
nothing
in
these
cases
which
indicates
that
any
of
these
interests
has
violated
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
applying
the
same
law
to
newspapers
that
applies
to
every
other
kind
of
business
in
the
country
whereas
this
rule
applies
only
to
newspapers
and
applies
a
rule
which
is
much
more
stringent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
assume
that
that
would
violate
antitrust
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
thought
you
said
all
the
newspapers
and
all
the
televisions
merging.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
under
many
circumstances
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
am
not
contending
that
newspapers
are
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
i
am
contending
that
they
cannot
validly
be
made
subject
to
a
blanket
rule,
based
simply
on
the
fact
that
there
is
cross-ownership.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not,
not
great
many.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
even
on
the
newspapers
side.
washington
at
the
moment
has
two
newspapers.
in
buckley
against
valeo,
this
court
said
that
the
concept
that
government
may
restrict
the
speech
of
some
elements
of
our
society
in
order
to
enhance
the
relative
voice
of
others
is
wholly
foreign
to
the
first
amendment.
this
is
a
sort
of
never-never-land
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
the
democratic
national
committee
case.
here,
the
first
amendment
designed
to
protect
press
freedom
is
used
to
restrict
the
press
and
this
is
done
to
enhance
the
first
amendment
value
of
diversity
on
broadcasting.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
sure
that
the
commission
did
it
only
there,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
a
presumption
was
compel
in
order
to
carry
out
first
amendment
values.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
democratic
national
committee
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
nothing
in
the
amendment
about
diversity,
just
freedom
and
there
is
a
further
paradox.
the
regulations
here
were
intended
to
affect
more
than
broadcast
media
and
they
can
have
no
effect
on
diversity
and
broadcasting.
looking
only
at
broadcasting,
there
would
be
no
more
diversity
after
these
amendments
rules
are
in
affect
than
it
was
before.
there
will
be
just
as
many
voices.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
am
quite
clear
that
diversity
can
continue
to
be
a
factor,
but
not
the
controlling
factor.
not
the
one
which
makes
a
controlling
presumption
in
the
face
of
which
everything
else
must
view.
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
chief
justice
the
closest
analogy
i
have
been
able
to
think
of,
i
suppose
based
on
my
past
experience
is
the
problem
with
the
buckley
case.
what
do
you
do
when
you
have
more
applicants
than
you
can
handle.
you
take
into
account
a
great
many
factors
and
you
come
up
with
your
conclusion
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
what
is
involved
here.
diversity
is
an
appropriate
factor,
but
it
is
not
appropriate
to
make
it
the
exclusive
factor
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
below.
the
first
amendment
is
a
shield
not
a
sword
to
promote
diversity,
but
the
court
need
not
resolve
this
constitutional
question.
just
as
in
helvring
against
griffiths,
it
held
that
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
by
congress,
it
need
not
decide
whether
stock
dividends
are
constitutionally
subject
to
income
tax
and
i
may
add
that
congress
has
never
made
that
decision
when
constituting
stock
dividends
or
not
subject
to
income
tax.
by
any
analysis,
the
prospective
rule
is
clearly
a
legislative
action
which
can
only
be
supported
by
an
adequate
delegation
from
congress.
it
is
my
contention
that
congress
has
never
made
any
such
delegation.
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
though,
we
have
the
fact
that
the
ban
on
cross-ownership
is
a
fundamental
exercise
of
governmental
power
affecting
important
aspects
of
our
free
society
and
involving
a
substantial
change
in
the
practice
over
the
past
half
century.
there
is
room
to
argue
i
think
that
such
a
fundamental
change,
going
beyond
radio
and
television,
and
reaching
into
the
printed
press,
is
one
which
should
be
made
or
authorized
by
representatives
of
the
people
in
congress
and
that
authority
to
make
such
a
change
should
not
be
inferred
or
surmised.
now
in
our
briefs,
we
have
discussed
the
nature
of
the
authorization.
all
that
has
ever
been
given
with
the
commission
was
given
to
it
in
1934
when
it
was
given
power
over
communication
by
wire
or
radio,
not
power
over
newspapers
and
it
was
also
given
authority
to
grant
licenses
if
public
convenience
interest
or
necessity
will
be
served
thereby.
language
obviously
taken
over
from
the
traditional
public
utility
statute
without
any
thought
of
newspapers.
moreover,
we
have
some
legislative
history
which
is
pretty
good,
detailed
in
the
newspaper,
in
particular
in
1952,
the
senate
passed
the
statute
affecting
the
powers
of
the
communications
commission.
the
house
amended
that
statute
with
an
explicit
provision
saying
you
do
not
have
any
power
over
newspapers.
the
exact
language
is
quoted
in
the
brief.
it
went
to
conference
and
the
conference
took
out
the
house
amendment.
but
the
conference
committee
issued
a
report
in
which
it
stated
that
this
was
taken
out
because
it
was
unnecessary
that
the
commission
did
not
have
any
power
over
newspapers.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
that
is
not
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
we
are
dealing
with
what
the
1952
congress
did.
the
1952
congress,
many
times
committee
reports
have
been
used
to
establish
the
intention
or
meaning
of
an
act
of
congress
and
in
the
hierarchy
of
committee
reports,
conference
committees
are
the
very
highest
and
here
we
have
a
conference
committee
report,
clearly
dealing
with
this
question
after
which
both
houses
passed
the
statute
and
the
president
signed
it
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
i
agree,
it
is
not
language
and
the
statute,
but
it
is
the
closest
to
it
that
you
will
ever
find
and
it
is
not
simply
a
case
of
subsequent
members
saying,
well,
we
did
mean
so
and
so
back
there
in
1934.
now,
i
must
turn
to
the
grandfather
question.
the
action
of
the
commission
making
its
new
rule
in
applicable
to
existing
licensees
except
in
certain
small
market
situations.
the
court
below
has
held
that
the
commission
could
not
in
the
court’s
words
rationally
reach
the
conclusion
in
favor
of
grandfathering
and
it
is
held,
apparently
based
on
first
amendment
values
that
there
is
a
“presumption
in
favor
of
divestiture”
which
must
be
given
“controlling
weight.
”so
that
“divestiture”
is
required
except
in
those
cases
where
the
evidence
clearly
discloses
that
cross-ownership
is
in
the
public
interest
and
the
court
expressly
recognized
that
its
pronouncement
was
a
“court
approved
policy”
and
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
for
adoption
of
a
rule
not
in
consistent
with
its
opinion.
in
doing
this,
the
court
violated
proper
standards
of
judicial
review
because
it
is
not
its
function
to
tell
the
commission
what
rule
to
make.
for
example,
if
the
commission
knew
that
it
could
not
use
the
grandfathering
technique
in
this
area,
it
might
decide
that
no
rule
at
all
is
preferable.
that
is
the
matter
with
the
commission
not
the
court,
but
the
court
below
has
decided
that
divestiture
is
required
except
on
an
affirmative
showing
of
public
interest.
in
essence,
this
is
the
question
which
was
decided
by
this
court
six
years
ago
in
the
democratic
national
committee
case.
there
the
court
below
held
that
the
commission
must
make
a
new
rule
requiring
licensees
to
accept
editorial
advertising
on
the
same
general
ground.
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
such
constitutional
requirement
and
that
court
should
not
freeze
the
commission’s
necessarily
dynamic
process
into
a
constitutional
holding,
but
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
below
has
done
here.
it
has
required
that
a
specific
rule
be
adopted
because
in
the
court’s
view
and
words,
the
first
amendment’s
search
for
truth
will
be
facilitated
by
governmental
policy
that
facilitates
diversity.
there
is
no
basis
i
think
upon
which
this
conclusion
can
be
supported.
i
am
supported
with
respect
to
the
grandfather
argument
by
counsel
for
the
federal
communications
commission
and
i
think
that
i
will
leave
most
of
the
rest
of
the
argument
to
mr.
armstrong,
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
idaho
power
case
that
the
selection
of
appropriate
policies
in
carrying
out
statute
is
an
administrative,
not
a
judicial
decision
and
in
board
of
trade
against
the
united
states,
a
good
many
years
ago
the
court
said,
we
certainly
have
neither
technical
competence
nor
legal
authority
to
pronounce
upon
the
wisdom
of
the
course
taken
by
the
commission.
now,
there
are
two
remaining
issues
to
which
i
can
give
on
a
brief
consideration.
in
its
final
order,
the
commission
listed
sixteen
situations
to
which
it
did
not
apply
the
grandfather
rule.
these
are
seven
cases
where
there
was
co-ownership
of
the
only
newspaper
and
the
only
television
station
in
the
community,
even
if
there
were
radio
stations
in
the
community.
there
were
also
nine
situations
were
there
was
a
single
newspaper
and
a
single
radio
station
or
a
combination
of
am/fm
radio
stations.
these
situations
have
been
called
egregious
cases,
but
i
think
that
is
too
pejorative.
they
may
more
accurately
be
called
small
market
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
this
portion
of
the
commission’s
decision
and
in
this
respect
the
court’s
decision
should
be
sustained.
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
“the
record
contain
no
evidence
that
justified
the
desperate
treatment
of
the
sixteen
affected
combinations”
and
the
commission
itself
said
that
the
rules
are
not
in
the
least
premise
on
the
existence
of
improprieties
in
the
operation
of
the
media
holdings.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
certainly
is
a
nice
question.
i
would
suggest
that
a
rule
which
is
applicable
to
only
sixteen
instances
out
of
hundreds
is
not
really
a
rule,
but
necessarily
involves
what
amounts
to
an
adjudication
with
respect
to
those
sixteen
instances.
for
example,
in
some
of
these
cases
there
is
a
cable
television.
in
one
of
the
cases,
where
there
is
a
newspaper
and
a
television
station,
there
are
seven
radio
stations
in
addition
to
separately
owned
in
the
community
and
all
of
those
things
it
seems
to
me
should
be
taken
into
account.
this
question
of
the
small
market
cases
is
dealt
with
more
fully
in
the
red
covered
brief.
finally,
i
would
say
that
this
dog
has
a
very
small
tail.
there
are
a
few
situation
of
cross-ownership
of
a
newspaper
and
radio
station
where
there
are
other
broadcasters,
television
or
radio
in
the
same
community.
these
were
not
covered
by
the
commission’s
order
because
of
the
grandfather’s
clause.
however,
should
the
court
uphold
the
court
of
appeals
and
saying
that
the
grandfather’s
clause
is
invalid
then
they
would
be
swept
in,
but
the
position
is
made
in
the
blue
and
the
green
brief,
that
radio
is
different
from
television,
that
there
should
be
separate
consideration
to
the
question
whether
the
rule
should
apply
to
radio,
and
where
there
is
only
a
radio
or
television
and
there
are
other
voices
in
the
community
and
my
position
is
that
care
should
be
taken
to
see
that
these
newspaper
radio
combinations
are
not
just
caught
up
in
the
draft
and
carried
away.
our
basic
contention
is
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
make
any
rules
in
this
area
either
for
constitutional
or
statutory
reasons,
but
that
if
did
have
that
such
authority,
it
did
have
power
to
make
the
grandfather
provision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
done
by
a
blanket
rule
which
prevents
the
consideration
of
all
of
the
facts
circumstances,
with
respect
to
that
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
this
case
it
is
a
blanket
rule.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
understand
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
when,
when
i
am
sorry
(voice
overlap)
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
the
washington
star?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
of
course,
as
far
as
i
know
is
the
only
case,
or
at
least
the
only
prominent
case
which
actually
exists
under
this
rule
and
i
think
it
shows
among
the
other
things
that
this
rule
does
not
promote
diversity.
what
has
happened
by
taking
the
ownership
by
a
newspaper
into
account
in
a
particular
case
with
respect
to
the
boston
herald
has
been
to
destroy
the
boston
herald
and
what
may
happen
with
respect
to
the
rule
is
applied
to
the
washing
star
may
be
to
destroy
the
washing
star
and
my
contention
is
that,
the
commission
not
only
has
no
authority
under
its
existing
statute
to
make
a
rule
applicable
only
to
newspapers,
but
that
it
may
well
be
unconstitutional
in
doing
so,
in
particular,
in
dealing
with
the
final
case
to
which
mr.
firestone
referred,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
about
that
in
the
record
of
this
case
and
if
the
commission
was
in
error
in
that
case
it
should
come
up
in
that
case
on
that
record.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
constitutionally
the
prospective
rule
should
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
i
can
concede
it,
yes
but
my
position
is,
that
the
prospective
rule
is
not
constitutional.
there
is
no
previous
case,
which
applies
any
statute
or
any
rule
of
the
commission
to
newspapers,
to
all
newspapers
and
only
the
newspapers.
a
reference
has
been
made
to
the
nbc
case
and
that
involves
question
of
affiliation
of
a
station
with
a
network,
completely
broadcast.
the
star
case
involved
multiple
ownership
of
broadcast
stations,
only
broadcast.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
was
probably
settled
as
long
ago
as
the
federal
radio
commission
case
in
1930.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
pottsville
case
is
1940,
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
the
red
lion
case
in
which
i
appeared
seven
or
eight
years
ago,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
court
has
taken
the
role,
i
am
inclined
to
think
for
the
better
though
it
is
an
awful
course
question,
but
there
is
something
about
broadcasting
involving
the
limitation
of
the
spectrum,
which
makes
it
appropriate
for
the
government
to
introduce
a
regulation.
there
is
no
such
rule
with
respect
to
the
press,
and
that
is
the
position
we
take
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
there
is
a
greater
scarcity
of
newspapers
now,
and
there
may
be
more.
the
next
step
here,
will
be
barring
all
newspapers
everywhere,
they
talk
about
swapping,
but
if
you
can
do
this,
you
can
make
a
rule
which
says,
that
no
newspaper
can
own
a
television
station.
we
think
that
this
was
in
effect
covered
by
the
gross
jean
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
quite
sure
it
would,
and
that
it
is
seems
to
me
is
exactly
what
the
court
decided
on
the
gross
jean
case
where
it
held
that
the
tax
applicable
only
to
newspapers
was
invalid
and
as
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
that
in
the
oklahoma
press
case,
the
singling
out
of
the
press
for
different
treatment
from
that
accorded
other
businesses
in
general
is
invalid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
that
was
i
thought
i
said.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
any
legislation
by
congress
which
is
applicable
only
to
newspapers
would
almost
inevitably
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
unless,
maybe
it
gives
them
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
have
always
been
troubled
by
the
newspaper
preservation
act
and
that
of
course
is
a
step
in
the
direction
of
easing
the
antitrust
laws
giving
them
something
and
as
long
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
applicable
to
newspapers
and
the
labor
relation
laws,
have
also
been
held
to
be
applicable
in
newspapers,
i
would
suppose
that
congress
can
minimize
the
situations
in
which
those
statutes
apply.
