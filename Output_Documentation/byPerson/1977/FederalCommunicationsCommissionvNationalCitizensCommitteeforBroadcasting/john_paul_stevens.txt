john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
let
me
asked
the
other
side
of
the
same
coin.
do
you
know
how
many
communities
in
this
country
have
more
than
two
newspapers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
a
great
many
and
hence
we
do
deal
with
a
product
of
scarcity,
even
on
the
newspapers
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
the
same
thing
in
democratic
national
committee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
armstrong,
how
many
of
the
members
of
the
class
that
are
preserved
by
the
grandfather
clause
with
that
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
argument
is
not
that
it
includes
some
specially
well
qualified
stations,
but
then
everyone
in
the
class
has
proven
his
entitlement
to
a
continued
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
local
ownership
point
which
is
the
first
one
they
make?
why
is
that
irrational?
is
it
that
it
is
so
improbable
that
will
have
an
impact
on
local
ownership
or
in
the
alternative
are
you
arguing
that
it
is
irrational
to
have
local
ownership
be
a
factor
to
consider,
which
are
you
arguing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
never
said
that
it
was
totally
zero
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
considered
rational
as
to
the
three
quarters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
listen
and
please
answer
my
question
if
you
would.
they
did
said
it
as
a
reason,
they
said
they
were
relying
on
it,
we
have
to
assume
that
they
wrote
that
opinion
in
good
faith
and
you
say
it
does
apply
the
three
quarters
of
the
existing
licensees.
is
it
irrational
as
applied
to
those
three
quarters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
irrational
consideration
that
concluded
that
it
might
be
and
that
is
all
i
held
and
you
gave
an
example
earlier
in
your
argument
of
the
washington-detroit
swap
where
it
took
place.
so
how
can
you
say
that
it
is
irrational
to
assume
that
it
might
take
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
did
not
bar
local
ownership.
i
disbarred
local
ownership
by
a
district
(inaudible)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
firestone,
i
know
the
newspapers
argued
that
they
were
not
involved
in
the
management
of
the
station
as
much,
did
the
commission
so
find?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
it
would
be
irrational
to
attach
any
weight
at
all
with
the
acquirement
of
local
ownership,
unless
the
local
owner
was
actively
involved
in
management?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
follow
mr.
justice
rehnquistâ€™s
suggestion.
maybe
all
of
the
past
the
commission
law
has
been
irrational,
the
question
is
whether
this
particular
ruling
was
rational,
is
it
not?
and
would
it
be
irrational
for
the
commission
to
attach
some
weight
to
factor
local
ownership
even
though
the
local
owner
were
not
actively
involved
in
management?
is
that
not
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
must
mean
different
things
by
irrationality,
that
is
there
are
different
kinds
of
irrationality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
whenever
you
find
inconsistency,
do
you
necessarily
find
irrationality,
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
ask
one
other
question,
mr.
firestone.
on
remand
i
take
it,
it
would
not
be
open
to
commission
to
rewrite
in
its
opinion
entirely
and
say
well
we
would
review
the
entire
matter
from
a
new
angle,
we
overrule
a
lot
of
prior
decisions,
we
now
conclude
upon
fresh
review
that
the
grandfather
clause
is
proper
and
the
prospective
rule
is
proper
both.
could
they
write
a
better
opinion
and
still
sustain
the
rule
under
the
court
of
appeals
mandate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
reach
the
same
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
you
assume
they
could
have
written
a
better
opinion
and
reached
the
same
result
you
must
be
assuming
that
it
was
not
totally
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
remand,
is
not
generally
the
remand,
it
is
not
the
remand
to
say
go
ahead
and
restate
your
reasons,
your
reasons
do
not
adequately
support
the
conclusion.
if
i
understand
that,
the
remand
is
to
carry
out
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
the
rule
should
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
griswold,
supposing
we
had
a
situation
in
which
congress
repealed
the
sherman
act,
then
passed
the
new
statute
and
said
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
newspapers
to
enter
into
agreements
and
restrain
the
trade,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
all
directed
in
newspapers
and
no
one
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean?
you
mean
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you
said
it
would
be,
in
other
words,
you
say
if
there
were
a
statute
to
repeal
the
sherman
act,
we
pass
a
new
statute
and
say
that
monopoly
and
restraints
to
trade
in
the
newspaper
business
are
here
by
forbidden,
you
say
that
is
unconstitutional?
