mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission’s
fundamental
position
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
first,
that
our
prospective
rule
is
a
rational
exercise
of
a
rule
making
authority
grounded
in
the
public
interest
standard
of
the
1934
statute.
secondly,
that
our
refusal
to
apply
the
new
policy
against
additional
co-located
newspaper
broadcast
combinations
to
existing
combinations,
except
in
certain
of
the
small
market
cases
is
rational
and
was
adequately
explained
in
the
second
report
and
order.
on
the
first
contention
at
the
outset,
i
believe
a
question
came
up
as
the
whether
the
commission
felt
that
the
first
amendment
was
the
source
of
the
prospective
rule.
i
will
concede
that
i
think
the
court
may
find
some
language
in
the
commission's
second
report
and
order
in
which
the
commission
said
that
what
we
are
doing
here
is
consistent
with
the
objective
of
the
first
amendment
to
encourage
a
number
of
speakers,
but
i
would
not
stand
on
the
first
amendment
constitutionally,
compelling
the
commission
to
have
adopted
the
prospective
rule.
instead
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
or
even
--well,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
it
is
authorized
by
this
public
interest
standard
and
the
communications
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
it
is
the
standard
that
among
under
considerations
that
the
commission
can
take
into
account
in
allocating
spectrum
resources
is
a
policy
of
diversity
and
that
is
one
component
of
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir
and
not
the
first
amendment,
i
understand
your
question.
in
applying
that
diversity
component
of
the
public
interest
standard,
the
courts,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court’s
dictum
in
the
1959
rca
case
have
long
recognized
and
being
visible
conceded
this
that
one
of
the
relevant
factors
the
commission
can
take
into
account
in
citing
how
to
allocate
spectrum
resources
is
whether
the
applicant
before
it
has
ownership
interest,
not
only
in
other
broadcast
stations,
but
also
in
newspapers.
so,
and
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
may
have
alluded
to
this,
as
we
view
this
case,
the
real
question
in
this
case
raised
by
the
prospective
rule
is
not
a
first
amendment
question.
it
is
whether
the
commission
has
rationally
in
applying
the
public
interest
standard
of
the
act
reached
the
position
where
it
is
ready
to
announce
that
this
one
relevant
factor
is
now
going
to
be
determined.
i
might
say
it
is
not
determinative
in
an
exceptional
case
which
might
warrant
a
waiver
of
the
rule,
but
for
purposes
of
argument
since
that
is
admittedly
an
exceptional
case
we
will
precede
on
the
assumption
that
we
said
it
is
going
to
be
determined.
and
the
commission
will
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court
because
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
multiple
ownership
rules
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
storer
broadcasting
case
in
1956,
if
an
applicant
owned
seven
am
radio
stations
for
example
and
was
applying
to
the
commission
for
an
eighth
am
radio
station,
presumably
it
would
have
been
recognized
that
in
applying
the
diversity
policy
in
passing
on
that
application,
the
commission
could
certainly
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
applicant
already
owned
seven
am
stations.
but
the
argument
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
storer
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
storer
case
had
accepted
was
that
the
commission
could
not
make
that
one
fact
determinative
and
would
instead
be
able
to
deny
that
application
only
after
a
full
hearing
in
which
the
applicant
could
submit
all
of
the
so-called
other
relevant
factors,
the
applicant
wished
to
consider.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
think,
i
believe
i
understand
mr.
chief
justice
that
your
question
is
suppose
the
commission
was
to
change
the
present
rule
which
says
there
is
a
limit
of
five
vhf
stations
to
try
to
change
it
to
four.
if
the
commission
were
to
do
that,
i
think
we
would
argue
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
think
the
closer
the
location,
the
easier
a
job
the
commission
would
have
in
convincing
a
court
that
its
public
interest
judgment
was
rational.
yes
sir,
i
would
not
want
to
say
that
we
could
not
argue
for
a
different
limit
even
if
they
were
not
close
together,
but
that
is
clearly
relevant
and
that
is
my
point
in
this
case.
that
just
as
it
was
a
rational
public
interest
judgment
in
storer
to
finally
reach
a
judgment
that
seven
am
stations
is
subject
to
a
waiver.
and
this
court
said
the
commission
once
it
reached
that
judgment
could
announce
its
judgment
in
the
form
of
the
rule
and
the
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
in
storer.
we
are
saying
to
you
that
a
point
has
now
come
and
the
commission
has
rationally
explained
why
it
feels
it
is
now
in
a
position
to
make
the
fact
that
an
applicant
for
a
new
license
or
a
transfer,
fact
that
that
applicant
is
in
newspaper
owner,
we
are
now
ready
in
the
application
of
our
licensing
experience
to
say
that
is
going
to
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
no
sir,
i
am
saying
that
we
have
to
still
defend
our
grandfather
rule
with
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
oh!
the
statutory
authority
point?
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
we
read
mr.
justice
white
the
nbc
case
to
give
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
but
if
we
are
acting
within
our
statutory
authority
and
in
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
discuss
being
visible
to
reference
to
the
52
legislation,
but
if
it
is
within
our
general
rule
making
authority
under
the
34
act
and
if
the
public
interest
judgment
is
rationally
explained
and
if
that
leads
us
to
a
decision
to
deny
an
applicant
license,
it
is
our
position
that
that
applicant
has
not
had
his
first
amendment
rights
violated
anymore
than
the
applicant
for
the
eighth
am
radio
station
would
not
have
his
constitution
rights
violated,
if
in
applying
that
rule
that
was
upheld
in
storer
we
turned
his
application
down.
now,
as
to
the
point
of
the
statutory
authority
in
the
reference
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
we
read
that
case
as
saying
that
in
applying
the
public
interest
standard
if
the
commission
rationally
concludes
that
an
applicant
is
not
going
to
receive
a
license,
that
the
applicant
cannot
complaint
because
of
the
fact
that
as
a
result
not
getting
a
license
his
first
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
where
relying
on
nbc
for
that
point
as
dispositive.
on
the
statutory
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
mr.
justice
stewart
we
view
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
we
do
not
ground
this
case
in
any
way
upon
any
assertive
statutory
jurisdiction
over
newspapers.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
the
ultimate
bottom
line
in
the
case
as
we
see
it
is
whether
those
spectrum
resources
have
to
be
given
to
an
applicant
and
we
would
say
that
this
court
in
the
dictum
in
the
1959
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
mcclatchy
and
clarksburg
cases
has
recognized
that
a
newspaper,
the
status
of
an
applicant
as
the
owner
of
the
newspaper
is
relevant
for
the
commission
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
give
that
applicant
a
broadcast
station.
so
we
do
not,
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
if
we
are
beginning
to
think
that
there
is
new
first
amendment
issue
because
of
the
newspaper
status
of
the
applicant
injected
into
this
case,
it
is
really
just
a
question
of
whether
the
commission
has
now
reached
the
point
in
the
application
of
its
licensing
experience.
well,
to
put
the
point
differently,
suppose
the
situation
had
not
adopted
this
rule
and
we
had
gone
through
the
formalities
of
the
process
that
lingers,
when
it
is
urged
that
we
should
go
through,
case
by
case
by
the
next
30
years
and
it
just
so
happened
that
when
this
court
reviewed
what
had
happened
after
the
next
30
years,
you
would
find
that
in
every
single
case
the
commission
had
said
in
applying
our
accumulating
insight
and
experience
we
reached
a
judgment
that
the
relevant
factor
of
the
applicants
newspaper
ownership
is
now
going
to
be
determinative.
application
denied,
really
that
that
would
be
no
different
situation
than
the
situation
we
have
now.
the
only
difference
is
the
commission
has
simply
announced
that
it
grants,
that
its
attitude
is
such
that
there
would
be
a
denial.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
excuse
me
sir,
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
statement
of
what
happens.
our
answer
would
be
that
the
commission
is
even
handedly
and
rationally
applying
a
relevant
public
interest
policy
of
diversity
and
i
would
have
to
concede
you
that
by
its
very
nature
that
is
the
policy
which
will
have
more
bite
as
far
as
a
newspaper
or
another
broadcast
station
is
concerned
that
it
would
as
far
as
the
owner
of
amtrak.
yes
sir,
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
by
its
very
nature,
the
policy
is
going
to
hurt
a
newspaper
applicant’s
chances
more
than
it
will
hurt
the
owner
of
the
amtrak's
chances
if
he
wants
to
go
a
license.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
think
that
the
policy
of,
if
it
could
be
characterized
is
that,
it
nevertheless
is
not
a
ground
for
striking
down
what
we
done
because
the
diversity
policy
would
seem
to
me
by
the
intend
of
your
question
would
fall
and
that
has
been
recognized.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
newspaper
at
all.
we
have
jurisdiction
over
the
newspaper
owner,
only
when
the
newspaper
owner
comes
to
the
commission
and
asks
for
a
licensed
which
is
what
we
do
have
jurisdiction
over,
the
allocation
of
a
radio
license.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
do
not
want
to
get
drawn
into
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
commission’s
ownership
purporting
requirements,
but
i
think
we
do
require
-.
moving
increasingly
to
acquire
increasing
annual
reports
about
other
ownership
interest
they
may
have
and
certainly
we
could
tell
from
an
applicant
being
before
us
i
think
whether
or
not
the
applicant
was
a
newspaper
owner
or
the
owner
of
amtrak.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
no
sir,
it
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
the
actual
wording
of
this
regulation,
yes
sir,
it
is,
on
its
face
it
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
that
was
the
point
i
was
coming
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying
that
would,
in
that
case
does
newspaper
ownership
would
actually
work
in
his
favor?
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir.
on
the
other
hand
i
would
have
to
concede
that
consistent
with
the
longstanding
commission
policy
as
reflected
for
example
in
mcclatchy
under
the
diversity
policy,
it
would
cut
the
other
way
and
how
the
mix
would
come
out
on
an
the
individual
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
under
those
circumstances
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
weight
in
favor
of
the
experience
factor
that
you
mentioned
would
outweigh
whatever
the
merit
the
applicant
would
suffer
under
the
diversity
criteria.
on
the
statutory
authority
point
we
have
two
arguments.
the
first
one
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
we
think
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
gone
through
that
the
34
statute,
the
public
interest
rule
making
standard
authority
given
to
the
commission
in
section
303
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
storer
is
sufficient
to
answer
the
case
and
that
the
court
should
not
give
much
if
any
weight
to
subsequent
legislative
history
that
was
relied
on
by
the
mr.
griswold,
but
if
the
court
is
disposed
to
take
into
account
subsequent
legislative
history,
we
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
74
statute.
in
1952
as
it
was
recognized
in
the
argument,
neither
the
house,
actually
well
the
house
of
representative
had,
but
in
the
final
analysis
it
was
just
a
conference
committee
report
and
there
was
no
legislation
on
that.
but
in
1974,
the
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
commission’s
outstanding
rule-making
proceeding
which
is
now
before
this
court.
they
followed
it
closely
and
there
was
interchange
between
the
commission
and
the
congress
concerning
the
evolution
of
that
percept
and
each
house
went
on
record
with
a
legislative
bill
in
1974
which
we
would
respectfully
submit,
simply
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
congress
in
1952
had
denied
our
authority
in
this
area.
the
house
of
representatives
said
whatever
it
is
you
are
going
to
do
in
your
outstanding
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
newspaper
broadcast
cross
ownership,
do
it
in
a
rule
making
percept
and
also
finish
that
rule
making
proceeding
by
a
date
certain.
the
senate
took
out
the
first
provision,
but
also
passed
a
provision
saying
in
this
outstanding
proceeding
you
have
got
proposing
a
rule
to
ban
future
newspaper
broadcast
cross
ownership,
finish
it
by
a
certain
date
and
although
the
two
houses,
the
different
versions
were
not
reconciled
and
no
legislation
ever
emerged,
we
do
think
that
the
1974
history
would
remove
any
possible
conclusion
that
in
1952
our
general
rule
making
authority
had
been
cut
down.
to
turn
to
our
case
before
this
court
as
a
petitioner,
it
is
our
argument
that
the
distinction
between
the
prospective
and
retroactive
rules
is
rational
one
and
was
adequately
explained
in
our
opinion.
in
the
case
of
the
prospective
rule,
the
commission
admittedly
operating
on
the
presumption
that
it
was
more
realistic
to
expect
true
diversity
if
you
did
not
have
common
ownership
decided
to
give
that
consideration
determinative
weight,
even
though
we
recognized
and
the
court
below
recognized
this,
that
there
was
no
guarantee
that
the
more
diverse
new
points
would
result
if
we
did
have
separate
ownership.
but
the
commission
said
under
these
circumstances,
a
prospective
rule
where
you
are
not
talking
about
other
countervailing
considerations,
we
think
the
one
reason
that
we
had
once
had
for
allowing
that
is
no
longer
determinative.
in
other
words,
we
can
have
a
pool
of
other
people
coming
forward.
we
no
longer
have
to
rely
upon
a
newspaper
owner
to
get
service
started
and
so
under
those
circumstances,
even
though
the
gain
in
diversity
may
be
slight,
it
may
be
only
hoped
for
in
great
many
cases,
nevertheless
where
there
is
no
real
cost
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
wheel,
we
are
going
to
get
it
determinative
weight.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
it
would
depend
on
the
contour
of
the
radio
station
in
washington
whether
or
not
it
would
place
a
certain
contour
over
the
city
of
baltimore.
i
do
not
think
it
is
by
any
means
compelled
from
this
rule
that
it
could
not
be
done.
in
fact,
as
to
make
this
one
very
clear,
this
is
not
a
total
ban
against
new
newspaper
owners
coming
into
broadcasting.
just
to
take
an
easier
case
if
it
i.c.
richmond,
virginia
then
for
sure
the
baltimore
newspaper
would
be
able
to
be
eligible
to
apply
for
a
radio
station
in
richmond.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
you
picked
the
case
that
would
require
some
detailed
application
of
the
standards
of
the
rule
and
i
would
not
know
right
off
hand
how
it
might
come
out.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
a
specified
signal
over
the
community
of
baltimore.
yes
sir.
the
other
considerations
that
were
present
in
the
case
of
a
retroactive
rule
which
did
not
in
our
judgment
outweigh
the
presumed
gain
and
diversity
that
would
have
resulted
from
applying
the
rule
across
the
board
were
first,
a
broader
divestiture
rule
of
the
sort
that
was
advocated
by
the
respondents,
national
citizens
committee
for
broadcasting
would
have
swept
out
proven
licensees
with
long
records
of
meritorious
service.
the
commission
pointed
out
and
i
think
it
was
paragraph
109
of
the
second
report
and
order
that
these
licensees,
many
of
them
had
been
there
from
the
time
the
station
was
first
established
and
there
was
a
study
in
the
record
that
it
has
not
been
disputed
by
mr.
robins
saying
that
the
particular
newspaper
licensees
had
shown
by
their
action
a
much
greater
long-term
commitment
to
broadcasting
than
had
been
true
with
others.
so,
the
commission
was
confronted
with
the
fact
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
get
rid
of
a
class
of
licensees
who
included
licensees
with
outstanding
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
every
member
of
that
class,
it
can
be
said
of
that
member
that
its
record
has
been
before
the
commission
at
every
three
years
at
renewal
time
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission
and
has
been
found
to
be
in
the
public
interest
and
the
commission
characterized,
generally
speaking,
the
record
of
the
class
as
a
group
as
meritorious
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
it
is
true.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes,
sir
and
in
the
case
of
these,
though
it
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
commission
at
three
year
intervals
and
it
is
found
they
had
been
serving
public
interest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
think
in
the
case
of
these
licensees,
generally
speaking
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
have
been
in
there
longer.
as
i
said
earlier
a
lot
of
them
have
been
in
there
since
the
beginning
so
there
has
been
much
longer
continuity
of
service
in
their
case
than
as
the
case
with
a
lot
of
other
licensees.
although
it
is
true
that
the
great
value
which
the
commission
places
on
continuity
of
service
has
clearly
been
evidenced
by
the
manner
in
which
the
commission
has
disposed
the
renewal
applications.
and
nothing
i
might
say
in
our
effort
to
preserve
our
grandfather
rule
in
this
case
is
intended
to
immunize
any
licensee
from
continuing
to
have
to
pass
the
commission’s
scrutiny
every
three
years
and
to
be
judge
on
their
performance.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
mr.
marshall
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
that
may
be
true
in
other
agencies.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
the
commission
is
obligated
by
[laughter].
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
would
not
want
to
concede
that
we
have
not
followed
their
statutory
mandate
to
make
a
public
interest
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
it
means
that
if
will
not
--
well,
there
are
certain
small
market
cases
which
washington
would
not
include.
so,
if
it
is
a
larger
market,
it
means
that
that
applicant
will
not
be
required
to
divest
because
of
the
cross-ownership
factor.
it
does
not
mean
that
applicant
three
years
from
now
will
get
a
renewal.
that
applicant
will
get
a
renewal
only
if
the
commission
upon
judging
the
applicant’s
record
of
performance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes,
sir.
all
that
these
rule
does
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
all
that
this
rule
does
is
tend
to
give
the
applicant
a
chance
to
have
his
future
fate
as
a
broadcaster
if
he
wants
to
continue,
determined
on
the
basis
of
his
record
of
performance
and
not
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
cross-owner,
that
is
all
it
does.
and
in
addition
to
our
justification
which
we
think
was
rationally
explained
and
our
right
to
say
that
continuity
outweighs
the
presumed
gain
and
diversity,
we
also
relay
on
the
doctrine
that
this
result
of
grandfather
is
so
clearly
rational
in
terms
of
our
legal
system’s
bias
against
retroactive
applications
and
new
policies
that
it
really
did
not
require
a
great
deal
of
explanation.
it
is
consistent
with
what
the
commission’s
licensing
policy
has
been
over
the
years.
it
is
consistent
with
what
we
have
done
in
past
instances
when
we
have
adapted
rules
that
are
designed
to
further
diversity
by
limiting
multiple
ownership
with
almost
without
exception.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
it
is
conceivable
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
experience,
five
years
from
now
might
reach
a
judgment
that
it
should
order
more
extensive
divestiture
and
give
more
weight
to
diversity
than
it
felt
it
was
able
to
do
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
proceeding
because
this
record
did
not
establish
a
strong
showing
and
commission
relied
on
that
heavily
and
clearly
intervening
experience
might
change
the
nature
of
the
record.
that
was
a
very
important
part
of
the
commission’s
balancing
process.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
is
the
position
we
are
relying
upon
in
order
for
our
authority
to
file
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
it
is
our
view
that
like
the
national
citizens
community
for
broadcasting,
they
were
a
party
with
a
very
strong
policy
preference
as
to
how
the
commission
should
have
weighed
the
competing
considerations
which
were
before
in
the
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
initially,
i
might
say
in
this
case
that
the
department
of
justice
did
file
united
states
versus
fcc,
they
later
withdrew
it.
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
denied
a
motion
by
the
national
association
of
broadcasters
to
strike
them
as
the
petitioner.
on
that
basis
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
we
do
not
question
their
authority
to
tell
us
that
they
wish
to
be
given
more
weight
to
the
given
presumed
gained
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
or
to
appear
in
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
your
honor's
question
is
a
good
question
and
i
must
say
that
have
not
focus
on
that
question.
from
my
point
of
view
from
time
to
time
i
have
considered
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
them
to
be
opposing
the
commission
on
a
broad
scale
in
the
courts
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
opportunity
of
some
future
occasion
to
make
that
argument,
but
i
must
say
that
i
cannot
be
very
enlightening
to
your
honor
on
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
at
least
we
will
go
for
as
far
to
say
under
the
circumstances
where
they
were
a
party
with
the
strong
policy
pitch
before
the
commission,
either
a
statutory
respondent
or
as
a
petitioner,
they
probably
should
be
allowed
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
would
guess
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
certainly
and
many
instances
we
would
have
to
rely
upon
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
did
not
understand.
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
to
be
in
that
context.
i
was
thinking
about
it
more
in
terms
of
a
case
where
a
governmental
agency
was
involved
and
there
is
some
authority,
it
might
not
be
correct,
but
we
have
been
led
to
believe
that
in
some
of
our
cases,
for
example,
section
402
(b)
of
our
act
as
opposed
to
section
402
(a)
which
is
governed
by
the
judicial
review
act
and
that
is
the
case
we
here
now,
but
if
it
is
a
licensing
case,
we
have
been
led
to
believe.
that
if
we
do
not
get
proper
treatment
in
our
view
from
the
court
of
appeals,
we
have
to
have
a
solicitor
general
signing
our
petition
to
cert.(voice
overlap)
that
is
what
i
have
in
mind.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
white,
as
i
understand
it
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
in
402
(a)
case
under
our
statute,
that
is
specifically
governed
by
title
xxviii
and
the
section
you
have
read,
clearly
gives
us
the
right
come
here
as
we
done
in
this
case
without
the
department.
we
have
another
statute
--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
yes
sir,
but
there
is
another
case
in
our
statute
47
u.
s.
c.
section
402
(b)
which
does
not
appear
to
be
governed
by
title
xxviii
in
just
a
classic
licensing
case
as
opposed
to
rule
making
and
there
we
have
been
given
an
opinion
by
the
department
that
they
must
file.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
well,
i
would
qualify
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
marshall
to
say
that
we
are
thinking
of
the
case
that
i
just
described
to
you
where
they
would
be
coming
here
advocating
the
position
that
we
had
advocated
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong,
iii
i
believe
that
the
federal
rules
do
make
allowance
for
that,
yes
sir.
