justice
byron
r.
white
how
often
as
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
one?
interstate
commerce?
it
is
interstate
commerce
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
is
not
over
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no,
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
cannot
agree
with
you,
you
cannot
win
this
case
without
our
deciding
the
constitutional
issue,
can
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
maybe
a
very
rational
application
in
public
interest
standard
and
it
is
still
barred
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
argue
the
constitution
as
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
we
can
just
cite
that
case
as
the
authority
for
the
constitutional
question
presented
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
that
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
armstrong,
could
i
ask
you
what
is
your
view
of
the
relative
position,
of
the
relative
function
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
bureaucracies
in
this
case
that
you
think
your
relative
position
is
governed
by
section
2348
of
the
title
xxviii?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
am
sure
that
it
looks
like
you
certainly
have
the
authority,
what
about
the
department
of
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
under
2348,
the
attorney
general
for
example,
could
have
instituted
the
entire
review
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals
just
disagreeing
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
do
not
question
at
all
of
the
authority
of
the
--
i
am
sure
you
disagree
with
them
on
the
result,
but
you
do
not
question
at
all
their
authority
to
take
the
position
contrary
with
respect
to
divestiture?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
appear
in
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
that?
it
is
not
say
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
it
and
has
controlling
interest
of
the
government
in
all
court
proceedings
in
this
chapter
then
it
goes
on
to
say
the
agency
has
the
right
to
represented
by
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
includes
the
power
to
make
the
decision(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
to
bring
the
petition
of
cert?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
did,
you
filed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that,
constitutionally,
the
prospective
rule
might
survive,
but
the
divestiture
rule
might
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
understand,
i
understand
but
you
concede
that
the
one
surviving
and
not
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
the
owner
of
broadcast
station
be
forbidden
from
acquiring
another
just
because
he
is
a
broadcaster?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe?[laughter]
it
maybe
settled
but
was
it
right?
was
it
settled
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why,
can
i
ask
you
why?
