justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
say
a
lot
of
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
for
example,
the
owner
can
own
general
motors,
a
line
of
steamship
line,
amtrak,
four
bars
and
grills,
chase
national
bank,
that
is
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
newspaper,
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
do
you
on
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
it
is
just
not
neutral
at
all,
but
you
are
not
neutral,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
do
not
see
where
you
get
the
jurisdiction
over
the
newspaper
owner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean,
do
they
do
have
to
set
out
all
these
other
things?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
proposed
owner,
does
he
have
to
set
out
everything
else
he
owns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
aimed
at
newspaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
care,
you
get
the
right
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
that
not
violate
the
specific
provision
of
that
committee
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
if
a
newspaper
in
baltimore
wants
to
buy
a
radio,
television
stations
in
washington?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
i
did
not
pick
richmond.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
diversity
involved
in
each
one
of
these
renewals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
have,
most
of
us
have
familiarity
with
renewals
and
applications
and
sometimes
you
know
renewals
are
almost
perfunctory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
speaking
about
fcc
but
in
others
did
it
not
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
could
not
be
in
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
include
the
diversities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
have
difficulty
with
--
suppose
it
happens
that
in
this
town
there
is
one
radio
station,
one
television
station,
and
one
newspaper
and
the
town
decides
why
should
it
not
and
this
has
been
renewed
for
the
last
ten
times.
it
ought
to
--
there
is
a
grandfather
clause?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
with
or
without
this
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
rule
does
tend
to
later
though,
does
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
armstrong,
but
regardless
of
all
that
we
recognize
their
right
to
intervene
in
this
court
at
anytime,
do
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
what
i
meant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
could
come
as
amicus
curie
without
the
consent
of
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
difficult
to
find
arbitrary
and
capricious
over
five
year
period
of
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
five
years,
they
worked
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
i
going
to
say
that
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
arbitrary,
but
it
shows,
it
is
hard
to
see
it
is
capricious.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
at
issue
a
federal
communication
commission
regulations
on
the
subject
of
cross
ownership
that
is
common
ownership
of
a
radio
or
television
broadcast
station
and
a
daily
newspaper
located
in
the
same
community.
the
regulation
banned
on
all
new
licensing
of
such
combinations.
existing
newspaper
broadcast
combinations
are
allowed
to
continue
an
operation
except
in
communities
in
which
the
only
broadcast
station
and
the
only
newspaper
are
commonly
owned.
in
the
later
situation,
divestiture
of
either
the
newspaper
or
the
broadcast
station
is
generally
required
within
five
years.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
perspective
ban,
but
held
that
commission
had
acted
arbitrarily
in
not
ordering
divestiture
of
all
existing
newspaper
broadcast
combinations
located
in
the
same
community.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
insofar,
as
it
upholds
the
perspective
ban,
but
reverse
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
orders
divestiture
of
all
existing
combinations.
we
hold
that
the
commission's
regulations
are
valid
in
their
entirety.
there
are
reasonable
means
of
enhancing
diversity
of
viewpoints
in
the
mass
media
and
thus
state
forth
within
the
commission
statutory,
rule
making
authority.
moreover,
given
the
physical
scarcity
of
broadcast
frequencies,
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
prevents
the
commission
from
allocating
broadcast
licenses
so
as
to
promote
diversification
in
the
mass
media
as
a
whole.
we
conclude
finally
that
the
commission's
decision
not
to
order
divestiture
of
all
existing
newspaper
broadcast
combinations
was
based
on
a
rational
weighing
of
competing
policies.
the
commission
found
that
the
existing
cross
owners
had
a
long
record
of
meritorious
service
and
cross
support
divestiture
requirement,
cross
disruption
for
the
industry
and
ownership
for
the
individual
owners.
in
light
of
these
findings,
the
commission
did
not
act
arbitrarily
in
confining
divestiture
to
cases
of
local
monopoly.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
