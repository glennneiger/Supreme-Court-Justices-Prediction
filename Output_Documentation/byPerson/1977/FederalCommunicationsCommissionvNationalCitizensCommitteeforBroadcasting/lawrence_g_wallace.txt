mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
the
united
states
which
is
the
statutory
party
in
these
proceedings
[laughter]
and
probably
would
have
the
right
to
intervene
because
of
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
as
applied
has
been
challenged.
however,
there
is
no
need
to
exercise
such
a
right
in
this
case.
under
section
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
are
not
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
any
act
of
congress
in
our
submission
to
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
could.
well
we
did
not
have
to
seek
to
intervene
for
that
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
under
section
307
of
the
communications
act,
the
federal
communications
commission
is
to
grant
applications
for
broadcast
licenses
if
the
public
convenience
interest
or
necessity
will
be
served
thereby,
and
for
more
than
30
years,
in
both
rule
making
and
licensing
proceedings,
the
commission
has
recognized
that
this
standard
requires
it
to
take
into
account
in
issuing
licenses,
the
interest
of
the
public
in
diversity
of
ownership
of
the
media
of
communications
and
among
the
factors
that
is
historically
considered
for
this
purpose
in
comparative
proceedings
over
the
years
has
been
an
applicant's
ownership
of
the
daily
newspaper
in
the
locality
to
be
served
by
the
broadcasting
license.
in
this
respect,
the
commission
is
charged
not
to
be
neutral,
but
to
make
an
inquiry
as
to
what
will
serve
the
public
interest
under
the
statutory
standard,
and
one
of
the
components
of
the
public
interest
is
diversity
of
ownership
of
the
media
of
communications
and
divergent
voices
to
be
heard.
the
present
rule,
before
this
court,
is
an
effort
to
deal
with
newspaper
broadcast
co-ownership
question
in
a
more
systematic
way.
it
is
not
a
rule
that
disqualifies
newspaper
owners
from
being
licensees
of
broadcast
stations.
the
rule
applies
only
to
co-ownership
of
a
newspaper
and
a
broadcast
facility
in
the
same
community.
newspaper
owners
are
not
disqualified
under
this
rule
from
ownership
of
broadcast
stations
from
licensing
broadcast
stations,
no
one
owns
the
particular
airways,
but
from
being
licensees
of
broadcast
stations
in
other
communities
and
that
is
an
important
distinction
to
keep
in
mind
here.
it
is
illustrated
very
well
by
the
recent
exchange
between
the
detroit
news
and
the
washington
post
of
television
stations
in
those
two
cities,
which
will
result
in
dissolution
of
two
of
the
two
co-ownership
situations
that
were
before
the
commission
when
it
was
considering
this
rule,
by
means
of
the
swapping
that
the
commission
anticipated
could
occur
without
in
any
way
making
newspaper
owners
as
such
ineligible
to
be
licensees
of
broadcasting
stations.
but,
by
applying
the
public
interest
standard
in
a
licensing
of
broadcasting
stations,
so
as
to
increase
or
at
least
to
protect
against
diminishing,
the
diversity
of
voices
to
be
heard
in
that
community
based
on
a
finding
of
the
commission
or
based
on
its
experience
and
much
evidence
was
before
it,
that
the
public
looks
primarily
to
these
two
sources,
to
its
daily
newspapers
and
its
local
broadcasting
stations
and
particularly
its
local
television
stations
for
its
news
and
for
its
information
on
public
affairs.
and
this
is
accentuated
with
respect
to
local
news
affairs
of
the
handling
of
this
matter
by
the
adoption
of
a
rule
rather
than
case
by
case
as
it
has
been
handled
over
the
years,
is
entirely
appropriate
to
facilitate
business
planning
and
to
enable
the
commission
to
bring
about
required
changes
as
a
result
of
reconsiderations
of
its
earlier
policies
in
which
it
has
granted
some
so-ownerships
of
co-located
stations,
cross-ownerships
by
means
of
what
has
been
referred
to
in
these
proceedings
as
divestiture
rather
than
what
is
being
referred
to
as
forfeiture
of
licenses.
and
it
is
important
that
any
retrospective
application
that
the
commission
was
considering
here
was
not
to
being
achieved
by
means
of
simply
forfeiting
the
value
of
the
license
and
the
goodwill
at
the
time
a
renewal
would
come
up
two
or
three
years
hence,
by
holding
a
comparative
proceeding
and
simply
awarding
the
license
to
other
applicants,
so
that
the
licensee
would
be
able
to
realize
only
the
physical
value
of
its
assets
as
a
result.
the
commission
was
concerned
with
protecting
licensees
against
this
result
by
providing
a
means
whereby
they
would
have
a
reasonable
period
to
swap
stations
or
otherwise
to
realize
the
market
value
of
their
licenses
all
with
the
view
toward
what
the
commission
has
over
the
years,
we
think
legitimately
recognized
to
be
a
component
of
the
public
interest
standard
that
it
should
provide
incentives
for
superior
public
service,
incentives
to
get
people
to
devote
their
financial
resources
and
their
professional
endeavors
to
providing
a
superior
service
without
the
risk
of
having
to
start
from
scratch
when
they
have
provided
such
as
service
every
three
years,
in
a
comparative
proceedings
against
others.
if
the
public
is
to
be
well
served
in
this
interest,
the
commission
undertook
to
protect
this
interest
by
proceeding
in
a
rule.
making
proceeding
rather
than
merely
applying
from
case
to
case,
the
new
insights
and
the
further
insights
that
is
developed
into
the
problem
of
concentration
of
ownership
of
the
media
and
the
problems
that
it
has
presented
that
have
come
to
its
attention
over
the
years.
it
further
sought
to
protect
these
interests
by
specifying
that
it
would
certify
transfers
that
resulted
from
the
divestiture
provisions
that
it
would
adopt,
and
it
did
adopt
some
as
the
court
has
been
informed
for
favorable
tax
treatment
under
section
1071
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
in
order
to
further
protect
those
interests
because
the
transfers
were
being
ordered
in
the
public
interest
and
a
waiver
provision
was
also
adopted
under
which
claims
of
particular
hardship
could
be
heard
with
a
view
toward
possibly
extending
the
time
in
individual
cases
and
the
like.
so
the
rule
that
has
been
adopted
in
so
far
as
it
applies
prospectively,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
valid
and
reasonable
way
to
apply
the
public
interest
standard
that
the
commission
long
has
been
applying
under
the
act
based
on
the
commerce
power
of
congress
and
the
divestitures
that
were
ordered
under
that
rule
we
also
think
were
valid
regardless
of
how
one
views
the
refusal
to
order
the
further
divestitures.
in
that
respect,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
that
commission
did
have
authority
based
on
the
considerations
that
were
before
it
to
recognize
that
especially
severe
problems
existed
in
communities
in
which
there
were
for
example
only
one
daily
newspaper
and
one
television
station
where
there
would
be
a
mutual
inhibition
on
cross
criticism
between
the
two
major
media
in
the
community
which
in
itself
would
leave
the
community
without
any
independent
voice
to
criticize
the
impact
that
those
media
have
on
the
community
and
the
effect
on
its
affairs.
we
think
that
this
is
an
egregious
consideration
that
the
commission
did
properly
recognize.
we
disagree
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
singling
out
those
particular
examples.
we
do
not
believe,
however,
that
the
grandfathering
that
the
commission
has
adopted
with
respect
to
the
other
existing
cross-ownerships
was
rationally
justified
by
the
considerations
that
the
commission
itself
chose
to
rely
on.
on
the
commission’s
own
terms
we
do
not
think
the
lines
that
it
has
drawn,
the
basic
differentiation
is
introduced
between
the
existing
cross-ownerships
and
the
future
license
questions,
including
transfers
has
been
rationally
justified.
before
i
turn
to
the
reasons
why
the
commission’s
justification
do
not
stand
up,
it
is
important
i
think
to
recognize
that
very
important
interests
are
at
stake
here
in
what
the
commission
has
decided
because
not
only
the
public
interest
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
associated
press
case
and
the
other
cases
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
aspects
of
regulation
in
the
area
of
news
media,
the
public
interest
in
the
widest
possible
dissemination
of
information
from
diverse
and
antagonistic
sources
as
it
was
put
there.
but
there
were
a
number
of
examples
before
the
commission
of
disadvantages
flowing
from
cross-ownership
or
safeguards
from
having
an
independent
voice
to
which
the
commission
was
surely
entitled
to
give
weight
without
going
into
great
detail
about
them.
examples
were
cited
to
the
commission,
the
joint
operating
agreement
being
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
about
to,
but
i
am
using
this
introduction
to
the
deficiencies
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
what
was
at
stake
before
the
commission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
obviously
some
weight
to
these
or
it
would
not
have
adopted
the
prospective
rule
in
order
the
divestitures
that
it
did.
one
of
the
constraints
upon
the
administrative
agency
is
consistency
in
its
treatment
of
various
parties
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
mr.
justice
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
which
were
presented
here
i
want
to
highlight
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all,
but
it
does
have
to
base
the
way
it
applies
that
change
on
rational
grounds
that
do
not
treat
individuals
arbitrarily
based
on
factors
that
are
unrelated
rationally
to
the
basis
at
which
the
agency
has
changed
its
position.
i
want
to
just
mention
one
or
two
examples
that
were
before
the
commission
and
to
which
it
obviously
gave
some
weight
in
adopting
the
prospective
rule
and
of
the
divestiture
requirement
that
it
did.
one
was
an
example
of
joint
operating
agreements
that
had
been
a
subject
of
negotiation
between
the
daily
newspapers
in
a
city
and
which
were
being
opposed
by
labor
unions
and
others
in
the
community
and
where
allegations
were
made
that
the
television
station
owned
by
one
of
those
newspapers
presented
no
news
concerning
those
agreements
and
their
negotiations
until
they
were
consummated
and
that
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
against
the
economic
interest
of
the
newspaper
that
owns
the
television
station.
another
example
was
editorial
support
in
the
local
newspapers
for
a
particular
location
for
a
museum
to
be
built
in
the
city
which
a
location
was
close
to
where
the
newspapers
were
being
published
where
there
is
considerable
sentiment
for
the
museum
to
be
located
elsewhere
which
is
brought
out
only
and
independently
operated
television
station
in
that
community
and
was
not
allegedly
covered
in
the
particular
papers
involved
there.
these
are
examples
and
the
idea
is
not
whether
the
particular
examples
were
accurate
but
here
were
the
kinds
of
dangers
that
the
commission
had
before
it
and
obviously
had
in
mind
in
its
concern
about
cross-ownerships
here.
the
other
factor
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
prospective
rule
that
the
commission
did
adopt
does
have
effect
on
existing
combinations.
this
is
not
a
bright
line
between
a
prospective
rule
and
a
retrospective
rule.
it
has
an
effect
on
existing
combinations
by
a
process
of
gradual
attrition
of
existing
cross-ownerships
at
the
time
they
are
transferred
for
value
and
for
example
when
the
washington
star
in
this
city
was
sold
within
recent
years,
the
transfer
policy
was
applied
to
it
and
the
co-owned
television
station
could
not
be
transferred
to
the
same
owner.
the
result
was
a
dissolution
of
that
ownership
where
the
competitive
daily
newspaper,
the
washington
post
was
allowed
to
continue
to
have
its
locally
owned
co-located
commonly
owned
television
station.
this
introduces
a
disparity
between
newspapers
in
the
same
community
which
is
a
serious
matter.
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
disparity,
that
it
is
not
something
that
congress
could
have
adopted,
but
it
is
a
disparity
in
treatment
in
a
constitutionally
sensitive
area
which
impels
us
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
reasons
given
by
the
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
be,
but
the
commission
is
under
considerable
inhibition
at
renewal
time
to
engage
in
what
it
considers
to
be
a
forfeiture
of
the
applicant’s
license
when
the
applicant
is
providing
great
service.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
arguing
that
the
commission,
there
are
particularly
strong
reasons
to
see
whether
the
commission’s
grandfather
clause
was
rationally
based,
whether
the
grounds
that
it
gave
for
adopting
the
grandfather
clause
stand
up,
on
the
commission's
own
premises.
that
is
all
i
am
arguing,
not
that
the
commission
was
compelled
to
have
a
grandfather
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
we
have
said
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
you
are
mr.
justice.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
too
far.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
requiring
a
rule
and
that
the
commission
if
it
can
rationally
justify
a
grandfathering,
it
is
entitled
to
adopt
a
grandfathering
provision.
we
are
saying
a
remand
is
needed
here
because
the
explanations
which
the
commission
offered
do
not
rationally
justify
the
grandfathering
that
it
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
arguing
several
points
in
response
to
that.
one
is
that
the
commission
has
not
repudiated
its
longstanding
policy
of
not
giving
very
heavy
weight
to
local
ownership
as
such.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
never
said
that
it
was
totally
zero.
number
two
is
that
one
quarter
of
the
co-ownerships
that
it
is
grandfathering
are
not
locally
owned.
it
does
not
really
support
the
grandfathering
of
those
particular
ones.
a
third
point
is
that
they
were
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
third
point
is
that
there
was
nothing
before
the
commission
to
--
it
just
shows
that
they
were
not
really
relying
on
that.
a
third
point
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
because
there
was
nothing
before
the
commission
to
show
that
local
ownership
would
be
diminished.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
approved
many
transfers
over
the
years
which
resulted
in
diminution
of
local
ownership
as
i
expect
they
will
approve
the
washington-detroit
transfer
and
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
commission
that
local
ownership
that
they
were
not
eligible
local
owners
to
come
forward
to
be
transferees
of
these
licenses
if
the
commission
were
to
require
that
they
be
transferred
to
locally
owned
interest,
if
the
commission
wanted
to
give
particular
weight
to
that
factor.
the
commission
certainly
did
not
give
any
weight
to
a
requirement
that
local
owners
be
found
in
the
instances
in
which
it
was
requiring
divestiture.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
but
you
need
a
rational
ground
for
belief
that,
what
you
are
worried
about
will
be
diminished
by
the
particular
course
of
action.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
have
some
expertise
in
this
area,
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
either
commission
practice,
what
the
commission
purported
to
rely
on
or
what
was
before
it
to
indicate
that
local
ownership
would
be
preserved
by
the
grandfathering
or
was
of
sufficient
concern
that
the
commission
that
they
were
taking
any
step
to
assure
transfers
to
local
owners
where
they
were
requiring
divestiture.
in
other
words,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
that
particular
element
was
a
make
way.
i
think
mr.
firestone
will
deal
with
the
other
grounds
relied
upon
by
the
commission
and
why
we
do
not
think
that
they
rationally
justify
the
order
that
it
adopted.
and
i
do
believe
that
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
in
1943
at
the
time
the
commission
adopted
the
rule
against
co-located
am
stations
it
did
not
grandfather,
it
did
not
introduce
the
disparities
that
it
is
introducing
here
in
the
example
that
i
gave
between
two
different
newspapers
in
the
same
community.
