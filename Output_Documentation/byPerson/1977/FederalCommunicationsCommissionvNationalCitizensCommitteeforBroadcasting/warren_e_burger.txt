we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
federal
communications
commission,
1471
and
the
related
and
consolidated
cases.
mr.
griswold,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
griswold,
suppose
a
television
station
had
broadcast
which
were
clearly,
for
the
purposes
of
my
question,
clearly
an
after
task,
the
hurdles
of
the
obscenity
decisions
of
this
court,
that
is
we
would
not
sustain
a
criminal
conviction
for
what
they
had
shown
on
the
television,
would
that
be
a
ground
considered
denial
renewal
of
the
license
of
the
end
of
the
three
year
validity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
would
you
square
that
with
the,
i
am
sure
you
have
a
distinction
between
what
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
my
hypothetical
then
the
only
adverse
evidence
against
the
broadcaster
is
found
in
the
series
of
broadcast
of
the
kind
i
included
in
my
original
hypothetical
question
and
the
commission
said
any
licensee
which
resists
in
that
kind
of
broadcasting
will
not
be
renewed.
that
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
diversity
not
been
a
factor
in
the
decisions
of
the
commission
for
three
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
have
a
half
a
dozen
considerations,
how
do
you
really
determine
which
is
the
one
that
both
counters
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
armstrong.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
weight
could
the
commission
give
if
an
applicant
had
only
four
television
stations,
but
their
market
area
came
in
to
play?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
had
in
mind
was
four
stations
in
new
york
city,
newark,
trenton
and
philadelphia
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
before
you
get
to
that,
we
have
said,
i
think
on
the
number
of
occasions
here
and
other
courts
have
said
it
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
confine
to
newspapers
or
publishers,
it
belongs
to
everyone.
but
suppose
you
had
a
broadcast
license
available
and
the
one
of
the
bidders
was
amtrak
and
the
other
one
was
responsible,
reputable
newspaper.
would
not
the
inquiry
give
great
weight
to
the
newspaper’s
experience
in
journalism
as
distinguished
from
amtrak’s
lack
of
joint
experience
in
that
field?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it
shows
their
experience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
only
one
newspaper,
the
newspaper
that
had
no
others
stations
and
no
other
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
inconceivable
that
after
five
years
experience
or
any
number
of
years
you
want
to
pick,
the
commission
might
come
to
substantially
the
same
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
now
in
a
rule
making
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
basis
of
experience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
more
than
recognize
that
you
insist
on
it
do
you
not,
mr.
armstrong,
you
would
assert
it
affirmatively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
consistency
concept
does
not
prevent
a
regulatory
agency
from
having
a
change
of
mind
or
heart
over
a
period
of
time,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
firestone
somewhere
in
the
course
of
your
discussion,
if
you
find
it
convenient
and
if
you
think
it
is
relevant,
would
you
relate
what
the
commission
has
done
here
to
its
situation
that
has
been
mentioned
requiring
a
divestiture
by
the
star
of
its
broadcast
relations
and
permitting
even
though
it
is
true
that
any
other
licensee
is
up
for
renewal,
but
one
was
mandatory
and
one
is
a
still
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
have
no
rule
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
a
difference
when
they
go
part
way
down
the
road
and
not
all
the
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
court
of
the
appeals
was
pointing
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
basic
principle
is
true,
why
does
it
not
apply
to
the
existing
situation
and
many
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
griswold,
you
had
some
observations
right
down,
so
that
your
argument
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
saying
a
newspaper
cannot
have
the
same
rights
as
anyone
else,
how
would
you
apply
that
preposition
to
what
i
have
just
been
discussing
with
mr.
firestone
on
the
star?
the
federal
communications
commission,
it
appears
said
to
the
star,
the
new
owners
of
the
star
you
cannot
have
this
televisions
station.
under
your
theory,
as
you
outlined
at
the
outset,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
a
blanket
rules?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
star
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
the
star,
when
a
new
owner
bought
the
star,
he
had
the
diversity
of
television
license
element
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
new
owner
bought
the
star

chief

warren
e.

yes,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that.[laughter]
i
was

going
to
call
your
attention
to
the

act.
