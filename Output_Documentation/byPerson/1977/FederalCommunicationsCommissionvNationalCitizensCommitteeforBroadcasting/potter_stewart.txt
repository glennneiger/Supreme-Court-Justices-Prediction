justice
potter
stewart
say
one
newspaper
in
a
two-newspaper
town
was
to
merge
with
the
other
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
existing
status
that
allows
that
in
some
circumstances
had
not
been
passed,
that
is
does
antitrust
laws,
do
they
valuably
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
newspaper
says
along,
the
only
reason
i
cannot
acquire
the
other
newspapers
because
i
am
a
newspaper,
some
other
company
could
acquire
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
news
business?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government
is
entitled
to
insist
that
there
be
dispersion
in
the
publishing
business,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
but
anticompetitive
does
not
conceal
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about
competition
in
the
news
business?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
under
the
antitrust
laws
could
validly
prevent
there
being
only
one
paper
in
the
town
where
there
have
been
two
before?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
that
otherwise
--
based
on
antitrust
considerations,
you
will
conclude
that
antitrust
laws
would
be
violated,
if
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
posed
to
you
though
the
situation
where
under
ordinary
antitrust
principles,
merger
between
two
papers
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
under
commonly
understood
antitrust
principles.
you
would
say
that
if
that
were
true,
you
could
prevent
the
merger
of
the
two
for
papers
without
violating
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
then
in
that
case
the
government
is
saying
there
must
be
two
newspaper
voices
in
the
city
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
not
say
then
that
the
antitrust
laws
could
validly
prevent
all
of
the
press,
all
of
the
newspapers
and
all
of
the
televisions
stations
in
the
city
merging?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
you
have
televisions
stations
as
well
as
newspapers?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)arguments,
at
least
part
of
it
was
different
and
that
is
that
this
imposes
an
administrative
inhibition
on
the
newspapers,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
however
which,
first
of
all
the
commission
does
not
have
statutory
jurisdiction
and
secondly
it
introduces
a
new
first
amendment
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
an
impact
of
the
what
the
commission
did?
justice
potter
stewart
involves
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
to
do
with
the
city
signal
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
true
about
every
licensee
in
this
country,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
every
licensee
has
had
his
license
three
years
or
more.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
true
about
every
licensee
in
the
country
with
one
or
two
notable
exceptions?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
we
do
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
that
disparity
would
be
wholly
correctable
within
a
maximum
of
three
years
if
the
commission
thought
that,
that
disparity
was
a
controlling
reason
for
not
granting
the
renewal
of
the
application?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
know,
but
you
are
arguing
now
that
the
commission
was
compelled
not
to
have
a
grandfather
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
had
this
perspective
rule
it
was
compelled
to
have
a
grandfather
clause,
that
was
i
thought
what
your
argument
was?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
in
requiring
a
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
did
seem
at
least
in
its
words
to
require
that
the
commission
issued
a
rule
in
this
area?
