mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
charles
firestone
from
the
national
citizens
communication
broadcasting,
which
of
course
does
seek
affirmance
of
the
court's
decision.
i
have
three
points
i
want
to
make
and
during
the
course
of
that
time,
i
do
hope
to
address
that
point.
first,
i
would
like
to
follow
through
on
the
deputy
solicitor
general’s
arguments
about
why
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
the
to
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
about
the
need
for
record.
the
point
is
here
i
think
that
the
congress
has
ordered
the
agencies
under
the
administrator
procedure
act
not
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
is
really
the
basis
of
this
court
reversal
that
simply
that
the
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
the
way
that
they
treated
the
various
issues
before
them.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
we
believe
that
if
there
is
absolutely
no
record
support
and
no
basis
for
coming
to
suppositions
that
it
could
rise
to
the
level
of
arbitrary.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
the
place
where
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
was
the
commission’s
failure
to
order
divestiture
and
the
failure
to
apply
its
prospective
rule.
they
applied,
they
set
a
standard
here
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
there
were
the
five-year
standard.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that
the
five-year
standard
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
five-year
standard
is
now
what
we
say
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
commission
used
totally
unsupported
conjectures.
they
applied
standards
which
are
inconsistent
with
past
commission
practices
and
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
communications
act.
a
second
point,
i
hope
to
make
in
my
argument
is
that
the
issue
of
discretion
that
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
contemplating
that
the
commission
would
have
discretion
when
the
case
was
remanded.
of
course,
the
agency
has
great
discretion
in
this
area
and
in
fact
the
court
restored
discretion
to
the
commission
in
the
important
area
of
renewals.
the
commission
took
away
its
own
discretion
by
its
ad
hoc
standard
in
considering
structural
allegations
of
concentration
of
control.
thus
the
commission
said,
concentration
controls
of
primary
licensing
factor
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
to
the
extent
of
that
orders
of
rule,
i
think
we
would
concede
that
the
commission
does
have
authority.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
to
have
no
rule
at
all.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes
you
honor,
there
is
a
difference
there.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
they
pointed
it
to
it,
but
i
suppose
that
if
the
commission
acted
rationally
and
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
many
areas,
this
decision
was
riddled
over
there
at
the
agency
level.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
many
of
the
areas
and
i
would
not
presume
to
be
able
to
figure
how
the
commission
is
going
to
treat
it.
they
do
have
wide
discretion,
but
it
seems
to
me
conceivable,
that
as
long
as
there
are
not
arbitrary
on
remand,
they
may
adapt
no
rule.
now
that
might
mean
no
perspective
rules,
well
i
am
not
sure.
but
if
they
do
adapt
the
prospective
rule,
as
they
did
here,
and
in
their
discretion
found
that
nothing
can
be
more
important
than
insuring
that
there
is
a
free
flow
of
information,
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
it,
it
derives
from,
but
not
just
the
first
amendment,
it
also
derives
from
section
303
(g)
of
the
communications
act
which
is
on
page
a
29
of
the
joint
appendix
where
it
says,
congress
mandated
the
commission
to
promote
the
effective,
the
larger,
and
more
effective
use
of
radio
in
the
nbc.
the
court
in
nbc
said
that
this
included
a
concern
about
the
monopolization
of
media,
but
the
commission
did
come
out
with
a
standard.
they
said
that,
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
a
true
diversity
from
newspaper
broadcast
station
combinations,
and
therefore,
in
looking
only
to
the
broadcasting
stations,
and
they
not
trying
to
regulate
newspapers,
they
treat
newspapers
as
they
treat
television
stations
to
the
extent
you
cannot
own
two
television
stations
in
the
same
market
and
they
look
to
the
equality
more
or
less
in
terms
of
where
people
get
most
their
news
and
information.
but
when
it
came
time
to
apply
this
to
renewal,
even
though
there
is
a
three-year
limit
on
renewals
set
by
congress
and
even
though
the
communications
act
mandates
larger
and
more
effective
use
of
radio,
the
commission
moved
to
immunize
existing
licensees
from
structural
challenge
on
from
the
basis
of
the
concentration
of
the
control.
and
on
these
three
points,
the
commission
used
to
override
the
strong
factor
of
the
diversity,
the
commission
itself
has
said
that
diversity
is
the
primary
licensing
factor
and
yet
they
look
to
this
three
overriding
factors
to
this
diversity
criterion.
and
the
first,
mr.
justice
stevens,
with
regard
to
the
local
ownership,
the
first
thing
that
commission
did
was
ban
local
ownership
in
the
prospective
rule.
if
a
local
newspaper
wants
to
acquire
a
local
television
station,
they
cannot
do
it,
the
factor
diversity
overrode.
secondly
as
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
right,
but
certainly
here,
what
it
showed
is
that
they
preferred
the
criterion
of
the
diversity
over
local
ownership
for
the
perspective
rule,
but
turned
it
around
and
used
this
criterion
to
override
diversity
for
existing
licensees
when
25%
of
them
were
not
even
local
owners.
secondly,
the
commission
only
looks
to
local
ownership,
traditionally
and
on
the
1965
policy
statement
on
renewals.
they
only
look
at
to
the
extent
that
there
is
integration
of
ownership
and
the
management.
and
here
the
broadcaster’s
claim
that
the
newspaper
owners
were
not
integrated
in
the
management
of
the
stations
and
commission
relied
on
that.
they
said,
where
they
not
separately
run
they
would
require
far
many
more
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
except
that
they
have
not
--
they
have
not
rushed.
perhaps,
they
could
supersede
it,
but
they
did
not
do
it
here.
they
did
not
really
explain
what
they
are
doing
here.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that
is
true,
but
there
are
internal
inconsistencies
here,
and
also
they
did
not
really
treat
this
issue
of
integration.
what
they
are
talking
about,
they
are
saying
local
owners,
they
do
not
really
go
into
this,
but
when
you
look
other
commission
law
over
the
years,
they
did
not
intend
to
overrule
this
issue
of
integration,
they
just
did
not
deal
with
it.
and
its
just
goes
to
the
arbitrariness
of
the
commission’s
decision
here.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
commission
stated
that
where
it
is
not
that
case,
where
they
are
not
separate
ownership,
they
would
require
far
many
more
divestitures.
they
did
not
actually
make
the
finding
that,
and
they
did
not
look
into
it
any
more.
they
basically
relied
on
these
representations.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
under
existing
commission
law,
unless
the
commission
changes
it.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
question,
but
if
it
were
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
i
think
that
the
question
here
is,
has
the
commission
been
internally
inconsistent?
have
they
been
inconsistent
with
prior
policies
without
explaining
their
part?
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
think
that
it
raises
the
question
of
irrationality.[laughter]
i
think
inconsistency,
raises
the
question
of
irrationality,
but
here,
if
they
had
some
reason
for
the
inconsistency
it
would
be
one
thing,
but
they
did
not
explain
any
reasons
for
that
and
they
just
mentioned
it.
in
fact,
in
this
case
they
actually
purported
to
be
following
past
policy.
they
alluded
to
the
1965
policy
statement
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
their
intention
to
go
to
retreat
from
that
integration
of
ownership
and
the
management
factor.
second,
the
issue
of
the
local
economic
dislocations
was
another
example.
first
of
all
whether
it
was
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
under
the
court
of
the
appeals
mandate,
the
quick
answer
to
your
questions
is,
i
do
think
the
commission
could
rewrite
the
opinion.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
and
reach
the
same
result.
it
is
very
hard
to
determine,
i
cannot
really
determine
that.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
right,
but
well,
i
think
generally
--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
we
do
not
read
that
decision.
we
read
the
decision
for
instance
in
footnote
53,
to
contemplate
that
there
might
be
a
totally
different
rule,
a
totally
different
even
prospective
rule
in
terms
of
a
30%
criterion
as
was
suggested
by
some
people
including
some
parties
here.
but
getting
on
to
the
local
economic
dislocations
criterion,
the
commissions
says,
we
are
afraid,
in
fact
they
do
not
make
it
clear
again,
we
are
not
sure
what
they
said,
except
that
the
counsels
explain
that
they
say
that
they
are
concerned
about
reinvestment
of
having
enough
money
to
increase
interest
rates,
or
concerned
that
interest
rates
will
increase,
if
there
is
a
widespread
divestiture.
and
they
were
concerned
if
there
would
be
enough
money
to
invest
in
the
program,
and
yet
the
commission
specifically
has
refused
to
look
at
this
question
in
licensing
cases,
and
in
the
alianza
case
which
we
cite
is
an
example
where
the
court
of
the
appeals
has
affirmed
the
commission’s
refusal
to
look
into
this
criterion
in
the
public
interest.
now,
they
are
using
that
criterion
to
override
their
strong
interest
and
diversity
of
communication
sources.
similarly
with
continuity
of
ownership
and
there
of
course
the
licensee
just
minimally
served
the
public
interest
over
the
years.
mr.
armstrong
says,
the
longevity
of
their
service
is
the
factor
that
really
matters,
but
if
their
service
has
not
been
good,
it
may
be
that
the
new
licensee
will
do
a
much
better
job.
in
the
wdhdh
case,
the
one
time,
when
a
newspaper
television
broadcaster
cross-owner
was
replaced
with
a
new
applicant,
that
new
applicant,
or
that
new
licensee
has
performed
excellently,
superior
service
throughout,
and
it
is
recognized
throughout
the
country,
to
that
effect.
now,
of
course
broadcasters
do
they
take
their
license
subject
to
renewal
at
the
time
and
subject
to
the
rules
in
effect
at
the
time
of
renewal.
no
license
can
last
no
longer
than
three
years,
they
ran
on
their
record,
and
you
can
have
the
record
go
on
for
say
that
because
they
did
a
great
job
20
years
ago,
but
have
not
done
a
good
job
the
last
three
years,
that
does
not
mean
anything,
and
has
not,
in
the
past
commission’s
decisions.
but
the
key
fact
here
is
the
commission
did
not
really
come
to
a
systematic
evaluation
of
the
record,
they
did
not
really
look
at
their
own
past
precedent.
they
did
not
look
at
and
there
are
internal
inconsistencies
in
the
order.
now,
with
the
respect
to
the
issue
of
discretion,
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice’s
question
with
respect
to
the
washington
star,
of
course
the
commission’s
rule
applies
to
transfers.
the
washington
star
was
in
bad
shape
according
to
their
allegations
and
they
needed
an
influx
of
money
and
they
--
not
into
a
transfer
of
control.
the
licensee
basically
would
have
continued
with
washington
star
and
wmal,
the
radio
and
television
stations,
yet
the
commission's
rule
prospectively
said
that
this
is
a
sale
and
the
public
interest
is
not
served
by
the
acquisition
of
a
tv
and
a
newspaper
or
broadcast
tv.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that
is
exactly
our
contention
that
it
should
and
in
fact,
what
they
have
done
is
apply
the
public
interest
standard
to
transfers
which
they
refuse
to
apply
to
renewals,
and
yet
it
is
the
same
a
public
interest
standard.
now,
maybe,
there
are
factors
that
can
override
this
diversity
criterion,
with
respect
to
renewal
applicants.
the
commission
did
not
really
and
rationally
dealt
with
that,
and
they
threw
out
some
reasons,
but
really
the
commission
had
a
goal
here,
and
they
stated
the
goal
as
diversifying
the
media
of
promoting
diversification,
and
yet
what
it
has
done
is
has
turned
around
and
protected
existing
licensees
against
challenge
and
against
the
applications
of
this
public
interest
standard
at
renewal
time.
and
i
like
to
give
an
example,
and
what
i
consider
a
better
example
in
terms
of
this
issue
and
that
is
in
lancaster,
pennsylvania,
there
was
in
1975,
a
newspaper
monopoly
owned
by
one
family,
the
only
newspaper
in
town,
the
only
vhf
station
in
town,
two
or
five
radio
stations,
a
cable
television
system
of
which
it
was
co-owned,
they
own
60%
or
40%
owner,
owned
two
of
the
remaining
three
radio
stations
in
town.
it
was
grandfathered
because
there
was
an
incoming
signal
from
a
station
assigned
to
lebanon
and
lancaster,
it
is
hyphenated
market
and
this
was
a
uhf
signal.
now,
in
a
consideration
on
that
renewal
of
that
lancaster
station,
the
commission
would
not
allow
a
showing
that
the
incoming
signal
was
not
a
significant
signal
that
15,000
people
could
not
really
obtain
that
signal.
it
will
not
allow
a
showing
as
to
inapplicability
of
any
of
these
criteria,
such
as
local
ownership,
such
as
continuity
or
local
economic
dislocations.
they
would
not
even
allow
a
showing
as
to
the
sherman
act
violation,
the
allegation
of
sherman
act
violation
which
the
commission
said
was
standard.
they
would
not
allow
a
showing
because
they
said
they
are
not
equipped
to
administer
the
antitrust
laws.
there
was
a
catch
22
there
and
finally,
under
the
reconsideration
order,
under
the
commissions
standards,
if
that
uhf
signal
went
dark
tomorrow,
of
course
the
situations
has
since
changed,
but,
if
that
signal
went
dark,
the
commission
said
in
reconsideration,
that
it
would
not
require
to
divestiture
even
in
that
event,
even
though
it
met
this
standard
of
egregiousness
that
they
have
required
divestiture
for
the
16
because
they
said
they
are
concerned
about
uncertainty,
they
did
not
want
the
licensees
to
feel
uncertain.
your
honor,
if
i
can
just
sum
up.
i
think
that
the
basis
here
is
the
first
amendment
interest
and
the
diversity
of
information
sources,
as
judge
learned
hand
said,
to
some
it
may
be
folly,
but
we
have
stake
upon
it
our
all.
thank
you.
