justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lindberg,
can
i
just
be
sure
i
am
following
this.
you
called
our
attention
to
233.20.
that
is
the
regulation
that
relates
to
the
emergency
program,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
afdc.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
afdc
rather
than
the
emergency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
your
point
is
that
it
did
expressly
authorize
emergency
assistance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
i
am
repeating
what
justice
stewart
asked,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow,
the
question
that
i
was
not
sure
of
is,
how
much
of
the
states
had
previously
been
doing,
although
it
was
special,
could
properly
be
classified
as
emergency
and
how
do
we
know
how
much
there
was
of
that
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
record
really
does
not
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
inference
mr.
justice
stewart
may
have
been
drawing
is
that
since
congress
sought
that
we
needed
another
statute
to
deal
with
this
problem,
that
perhaps
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
it
was
not
adequately
dealt
with
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
that
you
can
cover
as
you
go
along,
just
looking
at
it
rather
broadly,
if
the
ea
program
allows
50%
reimbursement
and
the
afdc
program
allows
a
larger
percentage
of
reimbursement,
and
if
the
state
could
be
covered
under
either
program,
why
would
it
ever
elect
to
be
under
the
ea
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
illinois
does
give
to
broader
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
it
thought
that
was
the
only
legitimate
source
of
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
true
at
the
time
of
the
program
involved
here
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
is
it
truly
moot
because
if
we
should
buy
your
argument
that
you
made
thus
far
and
let
the
state
know
that
it
has
the
option
to
reinstate
an
ea
plan,
is
it
not
something
that
might
be
likely
to
reoccur?
if
the
law
were
clarified
in
their
favor,
is
it
not
a
very
realistic
possibility
that
they
would
say
“we
will
reinstate
our
old
plan”?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
under
the
normal
test,
if
the
litigation
is
the
real
life
controversy
when
the
complainant
is
filed
and
when
the
district
court
first
decides
the
merits.
then
the
defendant
abandons
its
what
is
held
to
an
illegal
activity
and
resorts
to
some
other
program,
that
normally
does
not
moot
a
case,
does
it,
as
long
as
the
defendant
can
go
back
to
what
he
started
with
under
a
wt
grant
in
cases
like
that?
is
that
not
exactly
what
we
have
got
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
is
clear
that
even
if
there
was
a
violation,
it
is
moot.
are
you
not
arguing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
not
voluntary
if
it
is
undertaken
in
the
face
of
a
court
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
it
found
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
discontinuance
of
the
illegal
practice
is
a
factor
that
chancellor
may
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
an
injunction
that
does
not
render
the
controversy
moot
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
got
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
state
is
here
saying
“i
want
to
establish
whether
i
am
free
to
go
one
route
or
another”
why
is
the
case
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
state’s
position
is
that
it
can
do
either
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
certainly
not
bound
by
the
state’s
view
of
mootness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
are
asserting
that
they
can
do
either
one,
how
is
the
case
moot?
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
i
do
not
understand
your
look?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
state’s
behavior
in
this
case
is
in
any
way,
influenced
by
their
concern
about
what
might
happen
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
ii
regarded
as
rather
flagrant
misrepresentations
to
the
district
court
and
if
that
was
all
wiped
clean
they
might
have
a
attitude?
i
suppose
there
is
some
concern
about
it
in
the
temply
court,
was
there
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
in
that
situation
they
would
have
very
strong
motivation
for
saying
“this
case
is
awfully
moot,
please
leave
us
alone,”
but
if
you
are
talking
about
running
a
welfare
program
and
if
a
lot
of
states,
and
i
assume
some
do,
want
to
include
in
their
ea
program
certain
beneficiaries
who
are
ineligible
under
the
afdc
program,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
entirely
reasonable
to
assume
illinois
might
want
to
broaden
its
coverage
sometime
in
the
future.
is
that
not
a
likely
possibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lefkow,
do
you
not
leap
one
point
to
what
state
say,
to
be
sure
that
i
have
your
answer
to,
they
say
that
the
mandatory
language
in
402
(a)
(10)
is
that
it
was
controlling
in
townsend
does
not
apply
to
the
ea
program,
and
therefore,
you
do
not
have
the
same
argument
that
you
had
in
townsend.
now,
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lefkow,
can
i
approach
this
from
just
a
slightly
different
angle?
assume
contrary
to
the
suggestions
that
had
been
made
so
far
that
the
court
should
address
mandley
i
as
the
first
issue
and
assume
further,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
this
would
be
the
conclusion,
that
the
court
should
disagree
with
you
and
reverse
mandley
i,
would
it
not
be
true
that
in
that
set
of
circumstances
you
would
have
no
interest
in
the
outcome
in
mandley
ii?
there
would
be
no
reason
to
reach
mandley
ii
if
we
did
it
that
way?
as
if
we
held
that
the
state
could
grant
less
than
the
federal
government
authorized
which
it
tried
to
do
in
the
first
instance
and
we
rejected
your
argument
there,
would
that
not
end
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
say
we
disagree
with
you
entirely
on
the
merits
of
your
claim
that
they
must
provide
more
than
they
originally
provided
under
ea,
then
you
really
do
not
have
any
reason
to
object
to
the
program
now
in
effect
because
all
you
would
be
saying
now
is
that
it
is
wrong
to
do
as
much
as
you
are
doing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
critical
to
your
case
that
you
win
on
mandley
i
or
we
assume
mandley
i
was
correctly
decided,
one
of
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
however
we
so
allow
the
case
or
merits
or
anything,
there
is
no
reason
to
get
to
mandley
ii
if
we
do
not
make
the
assumption
that
you
correctly
prevailed
in
mandley
i
because
it
seems
to
me,
otherwise,
you
would
have
no
interest
in
mandley
ii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
litigant
has
no
interest
in
that
question
unless
it
was
right
in
mandley
i?
