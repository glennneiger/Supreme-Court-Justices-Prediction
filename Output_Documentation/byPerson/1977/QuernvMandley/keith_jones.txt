mr.
keith
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
authorized
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
because
it
was
believed
that
the
decisions
below
are
counterproductive
in
terms
of
the
legislative
purpose
of
encouraging
emergency
assistance
and
also
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
the
very
welfare
recipients
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
assisting.
the
legal
implications
of
the
decision
below
are
that
the
federal
government
may
no
longer
reimburse
state
payments
of
afdc
emergency
assistance.
second,
that
states
that
wish
to
make
federally
reimbursable
payments
to
afdc
recipients
in
order
to
alleviate
the
hardship
that
may
result
from
emergencies,
must
do
so
not
under
an
afdc
plan,
but
under
and
ea
plan.
third,
all
state
ea
plans,
whether
newly
created
or
preexisting,
must
afford
relief
to
all
needy
families
with
children.
you
cannot
just
carve
out
certain
groups
who
would
be
eligible.
they
must
provide
need
not
in
just
certain
enumerated
emergencies,
but
in
all
circumstances
entailing
the
risk
of
destitution.
the
foreseeable
practical
consequence
and
implication
of
this
decision,
we
believe,
would
be
that
many
states
that
now
provide
ea
or
afdc
emergency
assistance
would
be
required
to
simply
abandon
emergency
relief
all
together
because
they
simply
could
not
afford
the
extensive
program
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
view,
this
disruption
of
state
welfare
plans
and
policies
is
not
required
by
the
social
security
act.
the
burden
of
my
argument
here
is
that
decisions
below
rest
upon
a
misreading
of
the
scope
of
the
afdc
and
ea
programs
under
that
act.
i
will
begin
with
the
afdc
program
which
is
by
far
the
larger
and
more
important
of
these
two
programs.
under
afdc,
the
federal
government
reimburses
a
portion
of
state
payments
of
eight
families
with
dependent
children.
section
406
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
act
define
a
dependent
child
roughly
as
a
needy
child
who
has
been
deprived
of
parental
support
and
care
as
a
result
of
the
death,
absence,
or
disability
of
a
parent.
in
order
to
qualify
for
federal
reimbursement
for
afdc
payments,
the
state
must
submit
a
plan
to
the
secretary
that
satisfies
the
requirements
of
section
402
(a)
of
the
act.
if
the
secretary
approves
the
plan,
the
state
payments
are
reimbursed
according
to
the
formula
set
forth
in
section
403
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
under
which,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
federal
reimbursement
ranges
from
50%
to
65%.
alternatively,
in
some
cases,
the
state
may
elect
to
have
reimbursement
determined
under
section
1905
of
the
act
and
under
that
provision,
federal
reimbursement
will
range
from
50%
to
a
maximum
of
83%.
the
normal
mode
of
assistance
contemplated
by
afdc
is
regular
monthly
payments
based
upon
continuing
need,
but
the
secretary
consistently,
and
from
the
beginning
and
from
before
the
enactment
of
the
ea
program,
has
approved
state
plans
that
provide
for
supplemental
payments
to
meet
special
non
recurring
needs.
at
least
some
states
have
included
within
their
afdc
plans,
have
included
within
the
non
recurring
items,
emergency
needs
arising
from,
for
example
natural
or
man-made
disaster.
now
unfortunately,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
in
part
because
of
the
manner
in
which
this
litigation
has
proceeded,
the
record
is
not
satisfactory
with
respect
to
prior
administrative
practice.
the
secretary
has
never
formally
defined
the
special
need
items
for
which,
since
1949
and
not
before,
the
state
has
been
entitled
to
reimbursement.
in
an
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
clear
that
the
states
have
included
emergency
items
within
their
state
afdc
plans.
the
booklet
which
i
hold
here
and
to
which
the
respondents
have
referred
in
their
brief
--
mr.
keith
jones
not
all
states.
some
states
do
not
include
special
needs
at
all.
some
states
have
no
provision
for
special
needs.
mr.
keith
jones
i
think
that
is
not
accurate.
i
think
that
a
total
of
45
jurisdictions
that
includes
not
only
states
but
certain
territories,
includes
some
kind
of
special
need
item
in
their
afdc
plan.
unfortunately,
although
i
would
have
thought
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation,
we
could
have
identified
the
precise
count
of
the
number
of
states
that
provide
emergency
assistance
under
their
afdc
plans.
the
fact
that
state
plans
are
not
sufficiently
specific
to
permit
us
to
tell
the
court
exactly
the
number
of
states,
but
just
to
give
the
court
an
idea,
i
will
read
to
you
from
this
booklet
a
description
of
two
state
plans
which
i
have
selected
at
random
just
here
at
the
argument,
“michigan
has
a
special
circumstance
item
which
is
described
as
faultless,
the
provisions
for
medical
transportation,
access
shelter
when
required
to
preserve
equity
in
home
or
because
of
family
size
or
other
unusual
circumstances,”
and
that
is
all
it
says
and
i
cannot
determine
from
that
whether
it
covers
the
kinds
of
emergencies
with
which
we
are
concerned
here.
let
me
read
to
you
another
one
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
covers
provisions
for
supplies
for
college
or
training
school,
attendant
care,
camp
fees,
life
insurance
premium,
home
delivered
meals,
replacement
of
clothing
lost
in
fire,
flood,
or
other
catastrophe,
purchase
of
essential
furniture
required
for
establishment
of
a
home,
repair
of
essential
heating
equipment,
cooking
stoves
and
refrigerators
and
i
will
skip
some
of
the
items,
restaurant
allowance,
temporary
shelter
and
hotel,
and
allowance
to
meet
increased
needs
of
pregnant
mother.
there
are
variety
of
special
needs
there,
but
it
is
clear
that
some
of
them
include
emergency
needs
that
arise
from
fire
or
other
catastrophes.
mr.
keith
jones
there
is
more
in
the
record.
actually,
there
is
very
little,
if
anything,
in
the
record
in
this
case
which
establishes
prior
administrative
practice.
perhaps,
one
reason
of
why
there
has
been
little
emphasis
on
these
special
items
in
the
past
is
that
since
afdc
provides
for
regular
monthly
payments,
in
many
cases
emergency
needs
can
be
promptly
translated
into
a
decrease
in
assets
or
an
increase
in
expenses,
and
therefore,
reflected
in
the
changing
calculus
of
monthly
benefits.
now
for
that
or
for
some
other
reason,
it
is
true
that
the
secretary’s
construction
of
the
act
has
not
been
widely
publicized,
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
afdc
program
in
fact
has
been
construed
as
permitting
reimbursement
of
afdc
emergency
benefits.
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
keith
jones
well,
that
is
right
and
i
think,
frankly,
one
of
the
mysteries
in
this
case
is
why
illinois
ever
chose
to
have
an
ea
program
rather
than
an
afdc
emergency
program.
mr.
keith
jones
well,
there
are
some
minor
differences
between
the
two
programs
that
i
will
reach
in
a
moment
and
i
have
no
independent
knowledge
of
whether
those
differences
affected
the
state’s
decision.
it
may
be
that
the
state
was
ill-advised.
on
the
other
hand,
i
should
point
out
that
the
state
of
illinois,
at
the
present,
is
at
the
50%
level
in
its
afdc
reimbursement.
the
formula
under
which
federal
reimbursement
is
calculated
depends
upon
a
ratio,
in
part
at
least,
on
the
ratio
of
per
capita
income
in
state,
per
capita
income
in
the
nation.
right
now,
that
works
out
so
that
illinois
receives
the
minimum
reimbursement
under
the
statute.
so
for
illinois,
in
terms
of
the
direct
monitory
reimbursement,
there
was
probably
no
difference.
mr.
keith
jones
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
know
that
since
1975
it
has
been
the
case.
at
any
rate,
our
submission
is
that
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
afdc
legislation
and
its
broad
language
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
reimburse
the
states
for
their
emergency
payments
under
that
program.
now
whereas
the
afdc
program
is
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
a
statutorily
defined
families
with
dependent
children,
that
is,
of
one
parent
or
of
no-parent
families,
the
ea
program
is
designed
to
afford
short-term
assistance
to
a
much
broader
category
of
families
without
regard
to
the
requirement
of
dependency
that
is
the
lynch
pin
of
the
afdc
program.
as
is
the
case
with
afdc,
a
state
must
submit
to
the
secretary,
an
ea
plan,
that
satisfies
the
applicable
requirements
of
section
402
(a)
of
the
act
in
order
to
qualify
for
federal
reimbursement.
some
of
the
requirements
of
section
402
(a)
do
not
apply
to
the
ea
plans
however
and
in
particular,
the
requirement
in
section
402
(a)
(10),
that
benefits
be
paid
to
all
persons
who
satisfy
the
federal
definition
of
eligibility,
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
the
afdc
plans
and
not
to
ea
plans.
instead,
the
secretary
has
indicated,
by
regulation,
that
the
states
may
set
their
own
ea
eligibility
conditions
and
they
specify
the
particular
emergency
needs
that
their
ea
plans
will
meet.
now,
a
major
difference
between
ea
and
afdc,
as
we
have
already
discussed,
is
the
difference
in
the
applicable
formulas
that
determine
the
federal
reimbursement.
ea
has
always
have
50%,
whereas,
depending
upon
the
formulas
that
apply,
afdc
reimbursement
may
be
from
50-83%.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
correction
that
we
had
made
in
our
brief.
in
footnote
16
at
page
27
of
our
brief,
we
had
indicated
that
in
some
circumstances,
the
formula
for
determining
ea
and
afdc
reimbursement
may
be
the
same.
that
statement
is
incorrect.
we
pointed
out
in
a
letter
to
the
clerk
last
august,
which
i
understand
has
been
distributed
to
the
court,
that
different
formulas
always
will
apply
to
these
two
programs.
now,
there
are
other
significant
--
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
so-called
mandley
i
decision.
we
believe
all
illinois
attempted
to
do
here
was
to
set
reasonable
eligibility
standards
and
limit
relief
and
tailor
relief
to
those
circumstances
that
met
its
own
local
needs.
in
any
event,
once
the
state
ended
the
ea
program
that
was
the
subject
of
this
lawsuit,
the
case
was
moot.
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
state
then
amended
its
afdc
plan
which
it
could
have
done
from
the
outset
to
cover
special
emergency
needs.
as
i
have
explained
at
some
length
--
mr.
keith
jones
that
may
be
very
well
be.
one
of
the
ironies
of
my
situation
is
that
if
i
convince
you,
as
i
think
is
correct,
that
there
are
substantial
differences
between
these
two
programs
and
you
determine
that
once
the
state
shifted
to
afdc,
the
particular
complaint
that
the
respondents
made
was
moot,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
you
to
reach
the
underlying
issue
that
the
lawsuit
originally
involved.
mr.
keith
jones
well,
i
had
it
rest
that
in
reverse
order,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
let
me
forget
about
practicality,
as
a
jurisprudential
matter,
i
would
assume
that
you
would
first
determine
whether
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
state
and
the
secretary
in
the
district
court
this
time
around,
the
lawsuit
had
become
moot.
if
it
had
become
moot,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
you
to
address
--
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
the
end
of
it
and
all
of
my
efforts
with
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
case
would
have
been
wasted.
but
as
i
say,
as
a
jurisprudential
matter,
the
first
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
that
of
mootness.
for
that
reason,
mr.
justice
stevens,
although
had
you
given
an
opinion
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
the
ea
program,
the
state
might
have
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
the
litigation
could
have
resumed.
mr.
keith
jones
the
court
would
have
to
evaluate
the
likelihood
that
the
state
would
recur
to
the
behavior
that
caused
the
lawsuit
to
be
shaped
in
the
first
place.
mr.
keith
jones
well,
there
was
a
violation
in
the
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
order,
that
is
correct.
now,
the
question
is
whether
a
voluntary
cessation
of
that
alleged
violation
is
likely
to
be
temporary
or
permanent.
mr.
keith
jones
no,
the
order
did
not
require
to
an
afcd
program.
mr.
keith
jones
that
would
be
the
correct
in
the
wt
grant
situation
as
well.
well,
do
not
let
me
dissuade
you
from
reaching
the
merits
of
this
case.[laughter]
mr.
keith
jones
speaking
for
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare?
mr.
keith
jones
we
would
very
much
like
the
court
to
dispose
of
the
merits
because
that
would
give
both
the
states
and
federal
government
the
guidelines
that
they
need.
mr.
keith
jones
and
the
second
is
whether
mandley
ii
was
correctly
decided?
mr.
keith
jones
let
me
state
my
position
this
way.
i
think
the
court
must
first
decide
whether
the
afdc
plan
permits
the
states
to
pay
emergency
benefits.
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
correct.
now,
if
that
is
permissible,
then
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggest,
the
question
is
whether
having
shifted
to
a
valid
plan,
the
state
has
rendered
moot
the
initial
controversy
and
that
would
depend
upon
an
assessment
of
the
likelihood
that
it
might
go
back
to
its
original
simple
ways.
mr.
keith
jones
not
if
this
case
were
to
be
declared
moot.
but,
if
the
court
concluded
that
if
it
held
that
the
case
were
moot,
the
state
might
recur
to
its
forbidden
ea
program
then
you
would
have
to
conclude
to
the
contrary
that
it
is
not
moot,
and
therefore,
you
would
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
ea
program
can
be
tailored
in
the
way
the
state
has
done.
mr.
keith
jones
we
have
proceeded
under
the
hypothesis
that
the
state
would
not
revert
to
an
ea
program
since
it
can
satisfy
its
needs
under
the
afdc
program,
but
there
may
be
reasons
why
the
state
would
actually
prefer
an
ea
program
because
of
the
differences
between
the
two
programs.
mr.
keith
jones
the
state
has
asked
the
case
to
be
dismissed,
is
it
not?
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
jones
it
was
preparatory
to
a
speech.[laughter]
we
have
argued
that
the
state
is
so
unlikely
to
revert
to
an
ea
program
that
there
is
no
substantial
probability
that
the
wt
grant
line
of
decisions
will
be
implicated,
but,
it
may
well
be.
that
is
just
an
evaluation
of
probability.
mr.
keith
jones
absolutely.
mr.
keith
jones
that
is
a
likely
possibility.
it
is
a
possibility
and
what
you
say
also
implicates
the
last
argument
we
have
made
in
our
brief
with
regard
to
the
propriety
of
the
scope
of
relief
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
evaluation,
the
case
was
moot
in
the
district
court.
once
the
courts
of
appeals
broadened
the
relief
of
mandley
i
in
its
mandley
ii
judgment,
then
the
implications
of
that
decision
certainly
extended
beyond
the
state
of
illinois.
although,
the
case
might
be
moot
as
illinois
argued,
it
might
not
be
moot
as
to
many
other
states
which
would
be
concerned
about
the
validity
of
their
current
programs.
my
time
has
expired.
