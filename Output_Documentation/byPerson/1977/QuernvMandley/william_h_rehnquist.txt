justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
unless
this
court
were
to
consider
mandley
i,
the
state
would
be
forbidden
by
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
i
from
going
back
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
wt
grant
a
mootness
case?[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
mandley
ii
is
entirely
separate
litigation
from
mandley
i?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
different
case
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
this
court
is
not
bound,
of
course,
by
any
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
i
presume
the
parties
to
mandley
i
are
not
bound
under
any
doctrine
of
res
judicata
by
mandley
i?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
believe
they
are
bound
in
what
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
is
not
the
law
of
the
case
in
this
court,
it
is
the
law
of
the
case
in
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
they
have
given
notice
to
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
as
soon
as
you
are
a
party
to
a
litigation
then
whatever
you
do
thereafter,
you
have
to
give
notice
to
the
court
in
which
the
litigation
was
commenced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
hew
a
party
to
the
first
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
any
of
the
issues
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
that
is
now
before
us
dependent
in
any
way
or
question
in
any
way
on
mandley
i?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
say
that
mandley
i
is
not
before
us
in
the
sense
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
argue
perhaps
unsuccessfully
whatever
issues
that
they
raised
in
their
petition
for
certiorari.
you
say
it
is
the
same
complaint
that
simply
went
back
to
the
district
court
on
remand
after
mandley
i.
certainly,
we
are
not
bound
by
the
law
laid
down
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
first
mandley
i
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
if
the
illinois
welfare
people
had
never
tried
what
they
tried
in
that
mandley
i
under
afdc
and
simply
started
the
program
challenged
in
mandley
ii
that
the
case
before
us
would
be
any
different
than
the
one
that
now
is?
