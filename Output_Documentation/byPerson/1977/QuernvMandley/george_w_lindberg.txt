mr.
george
w.
lindberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
illinois
state,
defendants
in
this
cause
and
i
intend
to
argue
for
approximately
15
minutes.
i
will
argue
the
position
that
illinois
can
maintain
a
special
assistance
program
for
emergency
needs
under
its
regular
afdc
special
needs
program.
mr.
keith
jones,
the
deputy
solicitor
general,
represents
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
also
a
defendant
in
this
case.
he
will
argue
the
balance
of
the
time
and
specifically
address
the
subjects
of
the
basic
statutory
scheme
underlying
the
afdc
and
emergency
assistance
programs.
he
will
distinguish
the
two
programs,
one
from
the
other
and
he
will
argue
why
the
social
security
act
does
not
impose
mandatory
eligibility
requirements
on
the
state
in
that
regard
and
he
will
establish
why
after,
the
first
mandley
decision
in
this
case,
the
first
mandley
decision,
the
case
became
moot.
this
case
arose
when
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
illinois
emergency
assistance
program
violated
section
606
(e)
of
the
social
security
act
under
which
illinois
operated
the
program.
the
illinois
plan
for
emergency
assistance
covered
essentially
four
kinds
of
emergency
needs
for
afdc
eligible
individuals.
homelessness
due
to
damage
of
the
structure,
homelessness
due
to
partial
damage
of
the
structure,
and
the
court
ordered
evictions,
except
for
the
non
payment
of
rent
and
there
was
a
provision
for
adc
applicants
who
had
not
yet
obtained
eligibility
or
have
been
established
eligible
that
they
could
have
food,
clothing,
household
goods,
and
equipment.
the
plaintiffs’
allegations
in
attacking
the
plan
allege
that
the
illinois
emergency
assistance
program,
as
then
operated,
did
not
address
the
emergency
needs
of
all
destitute
children.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case,
the
individuals
were
persons
who
had
applied
for
and
had
been
denied
emergency
assistance
in
that
their
particular
need
was
not
one
of
those
met
by
the
criterion
that
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago.
these
attacks
were
all
principally
made
in
count
1
of
the
complaint.
count
2
then
went
on
to
address
allegations
that
the
illinois
plan
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
did
not
provide
emergency
assistance
to
all
persons
facing
destitution.
the
district
court
had
found
for
the
state
defendants
and
for
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
that
is,
it
did
not
find
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
and
it
did
in
fact
find
that
the
illinois
plan
created
under
606
(e)
did
not
violate
606
(e)
of
the
social
security
act.
the
plaintiffs
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
district
court
and
found
that
the
illinois
plan
more
narrowly
defined
eligibility
than
is
permitted
in
the
court’s
opinion
under
606
(e)
of
the
social
security
act.
this
has
been
referred
to
as
the
mandley
i
decision
because
there
was
a
second
appeal
which
i
will
address
in
a
moment.
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court’s
holding.
the
defendants
then
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
as
moot
for
the
reason
that
the
state
of
illinois
had
withdrawn
its
emergency
assistance
program
under
section
606
(e),
and
instead,
opted
to
operate
an
emergency
needs
program
under
the
regular
afdc
special
needs
program.
the
plaintiffs’
answer
to
that
motion
said
that
illinois
was
continuing
to
operate
its
emergency
assistance
program
and
not
under
section
606
(e),
but
under
section
402
and
of
course,
it
is
correct
that
illinois
was
operating
a
program
of
emergency
assistance
under
its
adc
provisions.
the
district
court
offered
the
plaintiff
ample
opportunity
to
amend
its
complaint
and
address
the
new
program
under
section
402
of
the
social
security
act.
the
plaintiffs
refused
to
amend
its
complaint
and
some
months
later
the
district
court
granted
the
defendants’
motion
and
dismissed
the
case
as
moot.
the
plaintiffs
again
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals,
again
having
a
second
opportunity
at
this
case,
concluded
that
the
district
court
erred,
the
case
was
not
moot
and
most
importantly,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
606
(e)
is
now
the
exclusive
statutory
channel
to
receive
federal
reimbursement
for
the
operation
of
an
emergency
assistance
program.
again,
the
decision
was
sent
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
entered
an
order
that
was
offered.
the
state
and
the
secretary
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
granted.
the
results
of
the
seventh
circuit
holding
in
mandley
ii
is
that
states
now
can
only
look
to
section
606
(e)
of
the
social
security
act
to
operate
an
emergency
assistance
program
for
needy
children.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
there
is
no
support
anywhere
in
the
act,
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
decisions
of
the
act
or
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
support
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit,
and
in
fact
what
is
available,
suggests
just
the
opposite
conclusion.
that
606
is
not
the
exclusive
mechanism
for
the
operation
of
emergency
systems
program.
the
social
security
act
establishes
the
basic
framework
of
supporting
the
operation
of
the
afdc
program
by
the
states
and
the
regulations
of
the
secretary,
perhaps
as
far
back
as
1949,
recognized
and
authorized
a
special
needs
program
under
the
conventional
afdc
program
operated
by
the
states.
specifically,
i
would
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
section
23-233.20
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
if
you
will
look
in
the
yellow
copy
which
is
the
original
brief
of
the
state
petitioners
on
a9,
you
will
see
the
language
quoting,
this
is
233.20a25,
if
the
state
agency
includes
special
need
items
in
its
standard,
parenthetical
a
describes
that
they
will
be
recognized
in
the
circumstances
under
which
they
will
be
included
and
provide
that
they
will
be
considered
and
need
determination
for
all
applicants
and
recipients
requiring
them.
now,
this
is
the
secretary’s
acknowledgment
that
special
need
items
are
permissible
under
the
regular
afdc
program
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
for
many
years,
emergency
needs,
non-reoccurring
needs
of
afdc
recipients
have
been
in
fact
met
under
that
provision,
special
needs
and
it
has
been
of
course
as
i
have
indicated,
recognized
by
the
secretary.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
no,
are
you
referring
to
the
statute
or
the
secretary?
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
i
believe
that
what
you
have
said
is
correct
in
your
question
that
it
is
a
generally
accepted,
understood
term
of
art
in
the
field.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
non-reoccurring
needs.
mr.
justice,
it
is
most
frequently
referred
to
in
connection
with
a
state’s
afdc
program
where
the
secretary
has
recognized
that
there
are
special
needs
from
time
to
time.
these
are
non-recurring.
these
are
in
addition
to
the
regular
established
monthly
grants,
for
example,
that
a
family
may
enjoy.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
only
by
use
and
application.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
yes,
i
understand
that
there
are
27
states
that
have
special
need
items
attached
to
their
afdc
programs
and
i
am
also
to
understand
that
five
or
slightly
more
of
those
states
do
meet
emergency
needs
under
their
special
needs
item
under
their
afdc
program.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
yes,
that
is
correct,
special
need
items.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
yes.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
yes.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
my
point
is
that
there
is
a
secretary’s
regulation
indicating
that
it
is
legal,
regular,
authorized
for
an
afdc
program
to
have
a
special
needs
provision.
the
next
step
then,
i
presume,
is
justice
stewart’s
question
is
does
special
needs
include
emergency
assistance
too
and
of
course
our
position
is
that
it
does
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
1968
amendment
which
gave
rise
to
606
(e)
as
a
new
program
to
include
a
new
class
of
people
whose
emergency
needs
could
be
met
immediately.
there
was
nothing
in
that
language
that
rejected
what
the
secretary
had
been
doing
and
approving
all
these
years
of
what
other
states
have
been
doing.
i
cite
that
section
only
to
indicate
that
special
needs
are
recognized
by
the
secretary.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
i
am
afraid
we
do
not
know.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
no,
we
can
indicate
that
there
were
man-made
catastrophes
and
natural
catastrophes.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
well,
i
think
in
part,
that
is
a
part
of
the
rationale
of
congress.
first
of
all,
they
were
concerned
that
there
are
not
needy
children
out
there
who
have
not
already
been
prequalified
for
afdc,
but
they
have
a
need
today,
tonight.
so,
they
authorized
this
new
program
in
1968
saying
regardless
of
the
afdc
eligibility
for
one
time
a
year,
in
other
words,
they
have
some
fiscal
concerns,
once
a
year
you
can
meet
the
needs
of
a
needy
child
without
worrying
about
whether
he
is
afdc
qualified
--
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
not
longer
than
30
days
in
one
year
--
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
--
and
that
was
the
objective
of
that
provision.
congress
obviously
wanted
to
go
beyond
what
was
already
being
done
and
we
have
no
argument
with
that.
our
position
is
that
both
programs
coexist.
mr.
george
w.
lindberg
well,
very
honestly
mr.
justice,
that
is
a
difficulty.
we
can
search
the
statutes
backward
and
forward,
but
we
cannot
find
that
type
of
support,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary.
