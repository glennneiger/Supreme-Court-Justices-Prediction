mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
arguments
that
you
have
heard
petitioners
point
out
the
difficulties
that
they
bring
to
the
court
when
they
do
not
follow
orderly
appellant
procedures
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
what
the
procedures
have
been
so
far
in
my
opening
statement.
more
than
two
years
ago
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
mandley
i
held
that
illinois
cannot
grant
federally
funded
emergency
assistance
to
some
needy
families
eligible
under
406
(e)
of
the
social
security
act
while
denying
it
to
equally
eligible
families
under
the
act.
this
decision
came
approximately
two
years
after
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
in
so
holding
that
illinois’
definition
of
emergency
need
conflicted
with
the
federal
definition
of
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children
contained
in
title
v
(a)
of
social
security
act,
the
court
of
appeals
filed
a
line
of
unanimous
decisions
of
this
court
starting
with
king
v.
smith,
townsend
v.
swank,
remillard
v.
carleson.
now,
rather
than
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals’
ruling
or
abandon
federal
funds
or
petition
this
court
for
certiorari,
the
illinois
welfare
officials
with
the
cooperation
and
approval
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
implemented
a
fictitious
abandonment
of
federal
funds
for
emergency
assistance
which
has
enabled
it
to
maintain
is
the
illegal
program
for
more
than
two
years
after
the
judgment
in
mandley
i.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
we
believe
it
is
a
sequel,
your
honor,
but
it
is
different
in
that
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
both
decisions
arose
from
the
same
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
believe
they
are
bound
under
mandley
i.
of
course
the
petitioners
do
not
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
it
is
the
law
of
case,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
we
do
say
that
the
petitioners
did
not
follow
the
orderly
procedures
to
present
this
case
for
review
on
certiorari,
should
this
court
deem
it
worthy
of
certiorari,
after
the
judgment
in
mandley
i.
that
has
resulted
and
the
court
of
appeals
having
to
make
a
second
decision
to
enforce
its
first
decision
and
further
resulted
in
many
needy
families
in
the
state
of
illinois
being
denied
emergency
assistance.
this
is
a
case
where
the
state
has
taken
tactics
to
delay,
delay,
and
delay.
what
they
did
is
they
merely
relabeled
their
emergency
assistance
plan
as
special
assistance,
submitted
it
to
hew
without
giving
any
notice
to
the
court
or
to
the
respondents
that
they
had
done
this.
hew
approved
that
plan
for
federal
funding,
placed
its
stamp
of
approval
on
it.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
they
should
have
given
notice
to
the
court
because
it
is
a
court
of
equity
that
was
considering
an
emergency
assistance
program.
this
program
was
identical.
there
was
not
one
changed
from
it.
it
was
in
violation
of
the
mandate
in
mandley
i.
it
was
within
the
parameters
of
our
complaint
because
we
allege
that
their
program
violated
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
they
were
parties
to
the
litigation.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
did
affect
in
our
opinion,
the
litigation.
it
was
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
it
affected
the
litigation.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
petitioners
had
engaged
in
circumvention
of
the
mandate
in
mandley
i
and
we
read
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
correct
in
that
for
all
the
reasons
that
they
lay
out
in
their
opinion.
hew,
as
i
said
also
approved
this
plan
without
giving
any
notice
to
the
court
or
to
the
respondents.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
they
were,
your
honor.
they
were
enjoined
on
the
motion
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
petitioners
then
advised
the
district
court
that
illinois
no
longer
had
an
emergency
assistance
plan.
contrary
to
representation
made
here
today,
they
did
not
tell
the
court
that
they
were
going
to
fund
the
program
as
a
regular
afdc.
they
had
asked
the
court
for
more
time
to
consider
what
to
do
after
the
mandate
in
mandley
i
came
down
because
they
wanted
to
consult
certain
legislative
committee.
at
which
time,
they
proposed
the
plan
to
avoid
the
mandate.
that
was
on
november
17.
this
is
noted
in
the
opinion.
i
happen
to
have
been
at
the
committee
meeting
that
day.
the
next
day
they
came
in
to
court
and
told
the
court
that
they
are
going
to
fund
this
program
solely
with
state
funds.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
also.
by
doing
so,
they
obtained
the
dismissal
eventually
that
the
case
was
moot.
on
appeal,
again,
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
ii
properly
reversed
and
remanded
with
the
direction
to
the
district
court
to
enter
the
proposed
final
judgment
and
decree
with
certain
modifications.
this
was
one
year
ago.
despite
this
court’s
denial
to
the
state
of
mandate
to
hew
and
to
the
state,
the
district
court
has
declined
to
enforce
the
judgment
pending
this
court’s
review.
now,
the
petitioners
say
that
the
judgment
in
mandley
ii
was
wrong
and
unnecessary
and,
moreover,
now
claim
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
mandley
i
as
well.
we
think
that
mandley
ii
was
right
and
needed
and
we
hold
the
same
opinion
obviously
as
to
mandley
i,
although
we
do
not
think
the
petitioners
had
probably
sought
review
of
that
decision
in
this
court.
the
respondents
concede
that
the
federal
judicial
power
has
substance
in
our
national
life
and
in
our
constitution
of
governments.
if
it
is
a
power
in
that
subject
to
defeat
at
the
hands
of
resistant
litigants,
then
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
must
be
upheld.
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
i
considered,
for
the
first
time
by
a
court
of
appeals,
the
1968
congressional
enactment
of
an
emergency
assistance
program.
this
program
had
a
number
of
purposes.
it
provided
that
both
people
eligible
for
afdc
and
people
not
eligible
for
afdc
would
be
eligible
for
emergency
assistance.
it
did
provide
short-term
help
to
get
a
family
over
a
crisis
so
that
they
might
not
have
to
be
dependent
upon
the
regular
aid
program.
in
addition,
they
provided
emergency
help
for
families
already
receiving
regular
afdc
or
families
eligible
to
receive
it.
in
fact,
the
senate
report
noted
that
this
type
of
family
would
be
the
typical
type
of
family
that
would
be
eligible
for
emergency
assistance,
the
family
who
is
eligible
to
receiving
afdc.
the
legislation
authorizing
emergency
needs
to
be
met
immediately
by
giving
flexibility
as
to
the
form
of
payment.
a
state
could
provide
the
payment
in
a
hurry
by
cash,
in
kind,
by
vendor
payments
or
such
other
methods
as
the
state
might
specify.
the
program
was
optional
with
the
states
and
it
was
limited
to
a
30-day
period
in
the
twelve-month
period.
and
to
encourage
the
states
to
participate,
congress
offered
the
states
50%
matching
funds
for
payments
made
as
emergency
assistance.
now
under
this
legislation,
there
are
five
points
of
eligibility.
there
must
be
a
needy
child
under
the
age
of
21
living
now
or
recently
with
a
relative.
the
child
must
be
without
available
resources
and
the
payment
must
be
necessary
to
avoid
the
destitution
of
a
child
or
to
provide
the
living
arrangements
in
a
home
for
a
child
and
neither
the
child
nor
the
relative
can
have
refused
without
good
cause
to
accept
employment
or
training
for
employment.
in
1971,
illinois
adapted
its
first
emergency
assistance
program
under
section
406
(e).
it
provided
nearly
complete
eligibility
in
terms
of
the
federal
statute.
it
provided
that
the
aid
would
be
given
from
the
local
offices
throughout
the
state
by
a
dispersing
order.
that
is
a
form
given
to
a
merchant
for
say
$10
for
food
or
$15
for
clothing,
or
whatever.
in
1973,
the
state
administratively
constricted
eligibility
in
the
face
of
contrary
state
legislation
which
requires
them
to
have
a
full
program
and
limited
emergency
assistance
to
new
applicants
for
afdc,
to
recipients
who
were
homeless
from
result
of
fire,
and
recipients
who
were
evicted
for
reasons
other
than
non
payment
of
rent.
now
i
have
noticed
in
their
regulations
just
this
summer
that
they
have
eliminated
even
those
evictions.
so
now,
any
family
evicted
in
illinois
who
is
without
available
resources
cannot
receive
any
emergency
assistance
from
the
public
aid
department.
in
addition,
they
excluded
all
non-afdc
eligible
families.
as
a
result
of
this,
no
relief
from
destitution
was
available
to
many
families
lacking
food
and
clothing,
all
evictions
now,
crimes
against
persons
of
property,
utility,
failures
of
turn
offs
as
a
result
of
agency
error
or
delay,
or
if
a
child
is
abandoned
by
a
parent.
the
state
also
centralized
the
distribution
of
emergency
assistance
in
the
state
capital.
after
an
applicant’s
request
was
approved,
the
case
were
to
mail
the
form,
just
bring
it
for
final
approval
and
then
if
that
was
approved
there,
a
check
was
mailed
back
to
the
recipient
somewhere
in
the
state.
as
a
result
of
these
procedures,
illinois
cut
its
expenditures
for
emergency
assistance
from
$2.5
million
a
year
to
$500,000
a
year.
in
doing
so,
they
referred
many
of
the
people
they
used
to
aid
to
private
charities,
some
of
whom
may
have
joined
this
suit
as
amicus
curiae.
for
instance,
the
united
way
of
metropolitan
chicago,
one
of
its
components,
the
counsel
for
community
services
which
is
an
umbrella
group
of
about
280
private
charities
or
social
service
agencies
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
suit.
these
charities,
lacking
a
regular
budget
to
provide
the
need
that
the
state
has
traditionally
provided
and
ought
to
provide,
have
been
unable
to
help
many
of
these
poor
people
and
these
people
then
are
now
just
suffering,
bearing
their
own
suffering,
as
this
court
said
i
think
in
the
maricopa
county
case.
illinois
testified
that
at
the
trial
the
reasons
they
constricted
the
program
were
for
administrative
ease
and
to
prevent
abuses
and
fraudulent
applications.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
department
was
processing
applications
much
too
slow
that
delays
of
7-10
days
in
assistance
were
not
in
common.
they
held
for
the
state
and
federal
defendants
on
the
eligibility
provision.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
i
reversed
holding
that
illinois
could
not
constrict
eligibility
among
needy
families
following
the
line
of
decisions
that
this
court
has
made.
it
is
an
important
principle
that
they
follow
because,
by
doing
so,
they
ensure
that
people
get
the
aid
that
congress
meant
to
have
the
aid.
further,
the
court
in
mandley
i
followed
what
i
think
is
a
traditional
pattern
and
practice
in
litigation,
at
least
from
my
knowledge
of
it,
when
they
invalidate
a
regulation
of
an
agency,
be
it
federal
or
state,
they
did
not
order
hew
to
file
draft
regulations
with
the
court
that
conform
to
mandley
i.
they
suggested
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
states
and
to
the
courts
if
hew
would
exercise
its
rule
making
power
to
give
a
new
regulation
to
replace
the
one
that
the
court
invalidated.
in
following
the
principle,
this
court
has
said,
which
i
believe
is
stated
succinctly
in
townsend
v.
swank,
that
states
may
not
vary
eligibility
requirements
from
federal
standards
in
the
absence,
at
least,
of
an
authorization
clearly
evidenced
upon
the
act
or
its
legislative
history.
the
court
of
appeals,
by
that
a
test
to
the
illinois
situation
and
it
found
in
section
406
(e)
(1)
two
areas
of
state
discretion
and
no
more.
it
found
an
area
of
discretion
for
the
form
of
payment.
the
state
could,
as
i
said,
make
cash
or
vendor
payments
and
it
found
that
the
states
could
in
406
(e)
(2)
include
migrant
workers
if
they
wished,
but
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
act
to
allow
it
to
exclude
the
families
that
illinois
had
excluded.
this
pointing
out
various
state
discretions
is,
as
this
court
noted
in
townsend,
cogent
evidence
that
congress
intended
no
further
discretion
to
be
given
to
the
states
to
narrow
eligibility
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
point
to
no
evidence
on
the
basis
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
my
answer
is
that
there
was
an
error
in
their
understanding,
i
believe,
of
the
case.
first,
we
would
say
that
the
result
is
the
same
whether
402
(a)
(10)
applies
or
not
because
the
principle
of
this
court’s
decisions
is
the
conflict
of
the
state
regulation
with
the
federal
statute
and
not
402
(a)
(10).
in
402
(a)
(10),
the
court
focused
on
making
sure
that
all
eligible
individuals
receive
assistance.
for
instance,
in
townsend
the
court
italicized
the
term
“all
eligible”
twice
in
the
opinion.
moreover,
402
(a)
(10)
would
not
had
normally
have
an
emergency
assistance
because
it
is
an
optional
program
with
the
state.
this
is
our
argument
that
applies.
once
a
state
opts
to
provide
emergency
assistance,
then
402
(a)
(10)
would
become
operative.
in
other
words,
the
term
“aid
the
families
with
dependent
children”
includes
whatever
aid
is
provided
under
title
v
(a).
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
we
have
no
quarrel
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
that
is
essentially
true.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult,
your
honor,
to
reverse
mandley
ii
without
considering
mandley
i.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well,
if
i
did,
let
me
make
a
small
extension
to
it.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
accepted
mandley
i
and
that
is
that
emergency
assistance
is
provided
pursuant
to
section
406
(e)
(1)
of
the
act
if
they
accept
federal
funds.
does
that
clarify
it
for
you?
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
your
honor,
the
reason,
it
is
to
an
extent
alive
is
we
oppose
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
did
not
expressly
read
the
limit
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
mandley
ii
so
we
felt
compelled
of
course
to
brief
the
merits
in
mandley
i
and
to
present
an
argument
upon
it.
i
will
make
no
further
argument.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
where
the
federal
defendant
has
waited
548
days
to
petition
for
certiorari?
i
do
not
know
of
any
case.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
the
mandley
ii
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
in
my
opinion,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
although
the
hew
did
receive
from
this
court
an
extension
of
time
within
which
to
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
to
review
mandley
i.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
did
not
petition
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
li
noted
that
they
considered
mandley
i
final
and
i
think,
of
course,
from
the
court
of
appeals’
position
they
had
to
consider
mandley
i.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes,
they
do.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
your
honor,
i
would
not
suggest
that
this
court
could
not
review
mandley
i.
what
i
tried
to
suggest
is
that
the
petitioners
have
not
followed
the
orderly
appellant
procedures.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
the
answer
to
that
is,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
they
believe
they
could
do
it
they
should
have
told
the
district
court
the
first
time.
they
should
have
put
it
in
the
answer.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
it
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well,
it
will
depend
on
the
state’s
own
law.
for
instance,
in
illinois,
illinois
has
a
statute
that
requires
the
state
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
and
to
fully
participate
in
all
available
federal
programs.
so,
we
do
not
think
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
right,
but
we
allege
that
in
our
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor
because,
as
we
mentioned,
the
state
has
a
statute
which
requires
them
to
fully
participate
and
number
two,
we
have
alleged
equal
protection
violation.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well
your
honor,
my
clients
would
have
a
reason
to
object
to
it,
but
whether
it
would
be
a
legally
cognizable
reason
would
be
another
question.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
we
certainly
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well
your
honor,
there
is
no
express
authority
in
the
social
security
act
for
providing
emergency
assistance
as
a
special
need.
you
heard
that
the
petitioners
have,
i
believe,
conceded
that
point
right
here
in
this
court.
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
clear
enough,
that
the
legislative
history
clearly
confirms
that
this
was
a
new
program
and
that
if
any
authority,
which
we
do
not
believe
existed,
had
aligned
with
hew
to
provide
emergency
assistance
as
a
special
need,
it
was
clearly
superseded
by
the
clear
congressional
direction
in
406
(e)
in
1968
and
that
we
raise
this
question
right
at
the
start
i
believe
with
the
petitioners
and
has
struck
me.
they
cited
this
handbook
of
public
assistance
administration
and
regulation
which
was
the
book
or
regulations
hew
had
before
they
begin
promulgating
them
into
federal
register
and
code
of
federal
regulations
and
they
read
that
special
need
regulation
to
the
court.
there
is
no
mention
in
it
of
an
emergency
assistance.
what
they
did
not
mention
in
their
briefs
or
in
their
argument
here
is
that
prior
to
1968,
hew
had
some
regulatory
material
on
emergency
situations
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
as
section
34.2
of
the
handbook
of
public
assistance
administration.
they
had
one
on
emergency
payees.
they
had
a
section
on
emergency
situations
prior
to
complete
the
determinations
of
eligibility.
if
hew
had
any
authority
at
all
to
provide
emergency
assistance,
it
would
have
been
under
these
provisions,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
their
administration’s
only
witness
at
the
senate
hearings
who
was
under
secretary
wahlberg
cone
that
hew
had
not
viewed
that
they
had
not
authority.
under
secretary
cone
testified
that
there
was
no
mechanism
in
existing
law
to
meet
the
emergency
needs
of
children
in
a
crisis
situation
and
remarks
on
the
floor
of
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reflect
that
it
was
the
new
law.
there
was
a
change
in
the
existing
law
that
for
the
first
time,
the
federal
government
will
match
the
payments
for
emergency
assistance.
so
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear,
whatever
may
have
been
before,
the
congressional
direction
in
1968
clearly
pointed
the
way
for
states
to
provide
emergency
assistance
if
they
provided
it
at
all.
under
the
cooperative
federalism
which
pervades
the
social
security
act,
the
states
do
not
have
the
ability
to
tailor
eligibility.
they
have
been
given
the
right
to
set
the
standard
of
needs.
illinois,
for
instance,
in
providing
shelter
for
somebody
who
is
destitute
do
not
have
to
buy
him
a
house.
they
do
not
have
to
pay
him
two
months
back
rent.
if
they
could
find
the
barracks
that
was,
in
chicago
it
is
pretty
cold
right
now,
it
was
heated
and
that
was
adequate.
this
is
a
minimal
program.
this
is
not
a
support
program
in
the
sense
that
the
afdc
program
is
a
support
program.
the
standards
of
the
act
itself
say
that
the
payments
have
to
be
necessary
to
avoid
destitution.
so
that
there
is
probably
not
going
to
be
any
fad
in
the
payments
that
the
state
makes.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well,
it
is
not
a
disaster.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
yes
your
honor,
subject
to
providing
aid
to
really
relieved
destitution.
for
instance,
they
at
a
minimum
--
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well,
or
food
or
clothing
or
shelter.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
well,
the
language
of
the
reports
and
the
remarks
on
the
floor
is
that
when
a
family
suffered
an
emergency
without
limitation
as
to
the
cause
or
the
type.
for
instance,
the
legislation
itself
expresses
that
there
is
only
one
case
of
fault
where
a
person
would
be
denied
assistance
and
that
is
when
they
refuse
to
accept
employment
and
training
for
it.
so,
i
think
congress
has
clearly
expressed
“we
want
to
protect
children.”
we
do
not
want
any
children
to
be
without
the
very
essentials
of
life”
because
really
this
is
what
this
country
is
about,
is
trying
to
make
a
better
life
for
everyone,
i
think.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
it
certainly
is.
it
is
a
sound
social
policy
that
congress
has
adapted
in
this
legislation.
we
would
say
one
further
point
on
mandley
ii
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
statutes
of
the
duel
authority
to
provide
emergency
assistance
that
the
petitioners
claim.
there
is
simply
one
way
and
that
is
it
has
to
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
of
section
406
(e).
i
do
want
to
make
a
reference
to
this
idea
that
the
45
states
provide
special
needs
and
i
believe
that
there
is
an
inference
that
many
states
provide
emergency
assistance.
well,
i
think
one
of
them
did
say
that
only
five
states
provided
assistance.
from
what
we
have
gleaned
from
this
document
of
hew,
which
is
not
really
very
clear,
only
five
states
provides
some
very
limited
items
of
assistance.
but
in
their
brief,
hew
concedes
27
states
participate
in
the
emergency
assistance
program.
15
of
them
and
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
in
the
brief,
but
15
of
them
have
full
eligibilities
required
by
section
406
(e)
and
the
other
12
have
different
degrees
of
eligibility.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
right.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
mandley
ii
was
clearly
correct
on
the
law.
it
is
an
analysis
of
the
legislation
and
the
history
of
the
legislation,
i
think,
prohibits
their
conduct
and
prohibits
their
claiming
funds
in
this
manner.
if
they
have
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
it,
i
think
that
they
would
advanced
it
long
before
presenting
it
for
the
first
time
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
ii.
they
never
told
the
district
court
on
remand
that
“we
can
do
it
this
way.”
they
wanted
to
keep
it
a
secret,
an
administrative
secret
perhaps.
it
was
and
they
kept
it
a
judicial
secret.
i
do
not
see
how
a
court
can
function
unless
it
gets
full
advocacy
of
the
truth.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
relief
question.
the
facts
show
that
this
is
a
most
unusual
case.
i
think
it
is
a
unique
case.
hew
had
issued
a
regulation.
it
was
invalidated.
the
regulation
on
emergency
assistance,
your
honor,
was
invalidated.
the
court
in
mandley
i
invited
hew
to
issue
a
new
one.
hew
did
not
issue
a
regulation.
it
did
not
petition
for
certiorari.
it
approved
illinois’
plan
without
any
regulation
at
all.
this
is
a
message
to
the
states
that
you
can
ignore
mandley
i.
you
can
ignore
judicial
decisions
because
we
are
going
to
put
the
stamp
on
your
plan
and
you
need
to
carry
that
over
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
collect
your
50%
reimbursement.
they
also
did
not
redefine
their
special
need
regulation.
they
could
have
put
ineligibility
standards
in
that
if
they
really
believe
that
they
could
do
it
under
afdc.
they
could
have
put
in
a
timeliness
requirement
because
under
afdc,
there
is
no
forthwith
requirement
as
there
is
in
emergency
assistance.
the
only
requirement
now
is
that
a
person
receive
assistance
within
45
days.
an
emergency
assistance
delays
is
emergency
assistance
denied.
they
did
not
make
any
recommendations
to
congress
that
they
needed
new
legislation
or
hold
any
hearings
in
the
states
to
see
if
there
were
any
problems
in
administering
an
emergency
assistance
program
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
i
defined
it.
they
engaged
in
the
circumvention
of
the
mandate
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
mandley
ii
found
that
they
had
indeed
circumvented
the
mandate.
under
those
circumstances,
within
three
years
since
the
complaint
was
filed
in
a
case
involving
the
needs
of
people
in
the
most
dire
straights
in
the
one
year
since
the
mandate
had
been
returned
with
no
action
by
hew,
i
would
not
say
no
action,
they
have
approved
the
plan
illegally.
the
court,
considering
mandley
i
was
a
final
judgment,
granted
what
we
believe
was
equitable
relief.
it
ordered
hew
not
to
approve
plans
inconsistent
with
406
(e).
it
directly
then
issued
a
new
regulation
to
replace
the
old
one
and
i
think
that
this
is
important.
they
modified
the
judgment
that
was
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
they
removed
from
it
the
requirement
on
hew
to
define
certain
terms
of
the
406
(e)
definition.
i
think
perhaps
it
is
best
and
easiest
to
just
cite
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
“it
did
not
require
hew
to
define
necessary
to
avoid
destitution
or
lack
of
available
resources.”
those
terms
were
not
really
at
issue
in
this
litigation.
what
the
court
said
was
this.
“while
it
would
be
salutary
to
include
such
definitions
in
the
new
regulation,
while
the
secretary
might
find
it
necessary
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practicality
to
include
any
items
in
this
new
regulation
--
to
include
them,
we
will
not
order
hew
specifically
to
include
any
items
in
this
new
regulation.
of
course,
whatever
regulations
the
secretary
issues,
it
must
be
consistent
with
today’s
opinion
in
mandley
i.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
lefkow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
clarify
our
position
in
regard
to
emergency
assistance
and
special
needs
or
emergency
assistance
as
a
special
need.
our
position
is
this.
if
a
state
should
be
allowed
by
this
court
to
grant
emergency
assistance
as
a
special
need.
a
state
must
still
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
eligibility
requirements
of
section
406
(e).
congress
in
section
403
(a)
(5)
of
the
act,
which
is
the
funding
provision,
provides
that
for
federal
reimbursement
if
a
state
makes
payments
as
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children
and
that
a
statute
is
contained
in
the
yellow
brief
at
page
a4,
on
a4
is
a
continuation
of
the
full
statute
set
out,
it
begins
at
a2,
and
at
a4
(subparagraph
5),
and
the
previous
parts
would
read
with
it,
“the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shall
pay
to
each
state
which
has
an
approved
plan
for
aiding
services
to
needy
families
with
children.
in
the
case
of
any
state,
an
amount
of
50%
of
the
total
amount
expended
under
the
state
plan
during
such
quarter
as
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children.”
this
language
reflects
that
congress
contemplated
the
function
of
emergency
assistance.
if
it
had
just
meant
emergency
assistance
in
406
(e),
it
might
have
said
“of”
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children,
but
it
said
“as.”
i
can
think
of
no
better
words
to
sum
it
all
up
than
to
repeat
what
judge
cummings
said
writing
for
the
court
in
mandley
ii,
“a
rose
is
a
rose,
is
a
rose.
emergency
assistance
is
emergency
assistance
no
matter
what
the
state
may
call
it.”
the
solicitor
general,
here
today,
acknowledges
that
he
does
not
know
why
the
state
participated
in
406
(e)
if
they
can
do
the
same
thing
as
a
special
need.
i
suppose
the
we
could
all
say
that
if
that
view
should
prevail
here
that
we
do
not
know
why
congress
enacted
406
(e),
but
we
think
congress
had
that
special
reason
to
enact
it
and
that
was
to
make
sure
that
all
needy
families
with
children
who
face
these
dire
circumstances
and
had
no
available
resources
to
meet
emergency
needs
receive
some
aid.
a
contrary
result
would
mean
that
congress’
statute
would
be,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
mandley
ii,
totally
eviscerated.
on
the
other
points,
there
are
ways
concerning
relief
both
as
to
federal
and
state
defendants.
we
believe
that
they
are
fully
covered
in
our
briefs
and
there
has
not
been
any
contest
on
their
part
about
them
that
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
in
ordering
the
relief
that
it
did,
and
that
it
should
be
sustained.
the
result
recently
in
mandley
i
and
in
mandley
ii
is
a
just
result.
our
elected
representatives
have
adapted
a
sound
social
policy
in
the
emergency
assistance
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
the
federal
and
state
welfare
agencies
charged
with
the
duty
to
administer
that
policy
have,
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled,
illegally
refused
to
discharge
their
obligations
to
the
great
injury
of
people’s
most
dire
straights
and
to
the
public
good
as
well.
the
beneficiaries
of
congress’
providential
policy
whom
we
represent
appeal
to
this
court
to
confirm
the
protections
afforded
to
them
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court.
thank
you.
