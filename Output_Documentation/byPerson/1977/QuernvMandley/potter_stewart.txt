justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lindberg,
is
there
any
further
definition
of
special
need
items
in
the
regulations
or
anywhere
else?
it
is
only
a
historic
understanding
upon
which
you
are
relying,
as
i
understand
it
rather
than
--
special
need
items
do
not
translate
freely
into
emergency?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
asking
you,
is
there
anything
anywhere
defining
special
need
items
except
the
definition
of
historical
experience?
justice
potter
stewart
to
cover
or
at
least
to
include,
what
is
the
emergency?
justice
potter
stewart
special
need
items
do
not
freely
translate
into
emergency
assistance,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
in
your
state
of
illinois,
the
history
has
been
that
these
payments
do
include
the
same
payments
that
would
have
been
provided
under
the
other
program.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
any
of
the
experience
or
history
in
other
states?
justice
potter
stewart
for
not
longer
than
30
days?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
twelve-month
period?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
which
has
aroused
my
brother
stevens'
interest
as
well
as
my
own
is
whether
or
not
special
need
items,
which
you
tell
us
is
nowhere
defined,
includes
the
very
specific
definition
of
emergency
assistance
appearing
in
606
(e)
(1)
and
reproduced
on
page
a6
of
the
appendix
of
your
brief,
the
term
“emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
and
children
means
any
of
the
following:
furnished
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
30
days
in
any
twelve-month
period
and
so
on,
which
is
very,
very
specific
and
does,
and
does
deal
with
emergencies
which
as
i
say,
does
not
translate
freely
into
special
need
items?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
best
test
of
the
administrative
interpretation
of
special
need
items
is
its,
as
you
are
standing
here
on
behalf
of
the
agency
and
i
guess
that
they
do
include
what
illinois
is
now
doing?
justice
potter
stewart
some
other
little
typo
or
something
in
your
brief
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
correct.
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
there
are
other
differences
between
afdc
and
ea
program
in
addition
to
those
relating
to
the
counts
of
families
who
are
potentially
eligible
and
the
rate
of
federal
reimbursement.
one
of
these
has
already
been
alluded
to,
whereas,
afdc
assistance
may
be
continuous
and
emergency
needs
may
be
met
whenever
they
arise,
ea
assistance
is
available
only,
as
the
statute
says,
for
a
period
not
in
excess
of
30
days
in
any
twelve-month
period.
in
other
words,
under
ea,
a
family
is
limited
to
one
emergency
per
year
and
there
is
no
similar
limitation
under
the
afdc
program.
there
are
other
differences,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
23-27,
relating
to
work
requirements,
age
limitations,
living
arrangements
within
the
family,
and
family
income.
with
this
statutory
background
in
mind,
it
is
somewhat
easier
to
understand
the
inception
and
follow
the
progress
of
this
lawsuit.
in
1973,
as
has
been
indicated,
the
state
of
illinois
adapted
an
ea
plan
and
the
secretary
approved
it.
the
ea
plan
covered
only
afdc
beneficiaries
and
provided
benefits
in
certain
enumerated
circumstances.
as
i
have
indicated,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
why
the
state
chose
to
provide
ea
coverage
since
it
could
have
simply
amended
its
afdc
plan
to
cover
the
same
beneficiaries.
nevertheless,
the
state
did
adapt
an
ea
program
and
this
litigation
resulted.
the
respondents
have
challenged
that
ea
program
on
two
related
grounds.
first,
they
claim
that
the
state's
plan
is
to
narrow
it.
it
should
be
extended
to
all
needy
families
with
children.
second,
they
contend
the
state
should
provide
assistance
whenever
necessary
to
avoid
destitution
and
not
just
in
certain
enumerated
emergencies.
our
position,
in
essence,
is
that
these
contentions
fail
to
make
out
a
cause
of
action.
the
respondents
have
not
been
unable
to
point
to
a
source
of
positive
law
that
entitles
them
to
the
extended
ea
coverage
which
they
seek.
their
claim
is
that
section
406
(e),
which
defines
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children,
constitutes
a
federal
definition
of
ea
eligibility
and
that
section
402
(a)
(10)
of
the
act
makes
that
definition
mandatory
upon
the
states.
section
406
(e),
the
definition,
does
not
purport
to
establish
eligibility.
it
does
no
more
than
define
the
outer
perimeter
within
which
the
secretary
may
make
reimbursement.
now
in
doing
so,
section
406
(e)
does
define,
in
a
general
way,
a
class
of
potentially
eligible
ea
recipients.
but,
section
402
(a)
(10)
does
not
require
a
participating
state
to
make
ea
payments
to
anyone
who
is
eligible
to
receive
them.
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
and
as
the
parties
here
now
apparently
agree,
402
(a)
(10)
by
its
terms
is
limited
to
just
the
afdc
plans,
not
to
ea
plans.
accordingly,
in
so
far
as
it
rests
upon
the
statute
at
all,
respondent’s
argument
boils
down
to
an
inference
from
section
402
(a)
(10)
that
congress
intended
to
impose
mandatory
eligibility
standards
upon
state,
ea
programs
as
well
as
upon
state
afdc
programs.
this
argument
has,
we
believe,
three
separate
and
independently
conclusive
answers.
first,
the
logical
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
statutory
text
is
just
opposite
to
that
that
the
respondents
would
draw.
since
congress
explicitly
made
402
(a)
(10)
applicable
only
to
the
afdc
program,
it
must
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
that
that
provision
would
not
apply
to
the
ea
program.
secondly,
the
respondents’
argument
in
this
case
is
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
reasoning
in
new
york
department
of
social
services
against
dublino.
in
that
case,
the
court
determined
that
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
manifestation
of
congressional
intention,
section
402
(a)
of
this
act,
this
very
section,
would
not
be
read
as
restraining
the
considerable
latitude
that
the
states
must
be
allowed
in
setting
their
own
welfare
policies.
here,
there
is
no
such
clear
manifestation
of
legislative
intent
and
the
respondents’
argument,
by
implication,
does
not
remedy
that
deficiency.
third,
the
task
of
interpreting
and
applying
the
statute
has
been
delegated
in
the
first
instance
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
has
construed
the
act
as
granting
the
states
leeway
to
set
their
own
ea
eligibility
standards
and
that
construction
should
be
accorded
deference
in
the
absence
of
compelling
legislative
history
to
the
contrary
and
there
is
none
here.
in
this
regard,
i
would
like
to
dispel
any
confusion
that
may
have
been
created
by
the
respondents’
claim
that
the
secretary’s
regulations
have
been
superseded.
secondly,
respondents
in
their
brief
contend
that
the
so
called
townsend
regulations,
which
the
secretary
adapted
in
the
wake
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
king
against
smith,
townsend
against
swank,
and
carleson
against
remillard,
supersede
the
specific
ea
regulations.
but,
the
townsend
regulations
do
no
more
than
acknowledge
the
townsend
line
of
decisions
which
were
that
402
(a)
(10)
imposes
mandatory
federal
eligibility
requirements
on
afdc
programs.
all
the
regulations
do
is
say
in
effect,
that
the
states
must
abide
by
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
the
regulations
do
not
go
further
and
attempt
to
define
those
requirements.
in
particular,
they
do
not
purport
to
require
the
states
to
abide
by
mandatory
federal
ea
eligibility
requirement.
accordingly,
the
townsend
regulations
have
not
superseded
the
secretary’s
more
specific
regulations
relating
to
the
ea
program.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
first
decision
in
this
case.
the
states
participating
in
the
ea
program
are
not
required
to
pay
benefits
to
every
needy
family
with
children
in
every
circumstance
presenting
the
risk
of
destitution.
instead,
they
may
set
their
own
reasonable
eligibility
standards
and
limit
relief
to
those
circumstances
as
emergency
needs
that
they
deem
most
compelling.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
court
of
appeals’
first
decision
which
is
the
mandley
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
how
many
of
these
issues
do
we
need
o
take
on?
it
will
be
misleading
and
inconsistent.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
end
of
it,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
has
involved
a
violator
from
the
idea
was
that
after
somebody
has
voluntary
ceased
activity
and
a
claim
was
made,
there
is
no
point
in
enjoining
them,
but
this
court
in
that
and
other
cases
held
that,
yes,
you
can
enjoin
them
because
they
might,
sometime
in
the
future
want
to
continue
their
violations,
but
your
claim
here
is
that
there
was
no
violation,
that
we
should
decide
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
complain
to
everybody.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
at
least
two
issues
involving
the
merits.
one
is,
was
mandley
i
correctly
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly
was
mandley
ii
correctly
decided
on
the
merits
and
those
are
two
quite
different
though
perhaps
related
issues?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
is
what
is
going
on
now?
justice
potter
stewart
going
back
to
ea
and
just
say
everybody?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
law
of
the
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
you
have
been
interrupted,
mr.
lefkow,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
say
is
now
before
the
court.
as
i
understand
it,
petitioner
for
certiorari
was
granted
to
review
mandley
ii?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct
and
mandley
ii
really
presents
only
the
issue
of
whether
the
program
that
illinois
is
now
carrying
on
under
the
afdc
is
permissible
under
afdc,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
really
what
it
comes
down
to
and
if
we
hold
that
it
is,
you
lose
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
case
and
if
we
hold
that
it
is
not,
you
win
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
case
that
way,
without
considering
mandley
i
at
all
or
without
considering
mootness
at
all,
is
that
not
right?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
a
permissible
course
of
action
which
illinois
has
now
taken,
under
its
understanding
of
the
authorization
given
to
it
by
the
afdc
provisions,
then
that
is
the
end
of
it,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
why
not?
i
thought
you
said
you
agreed
with
me
at
first?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
please
because
it
is
not
clear
to
me
as
to
what
we
have
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
it
does
and
maybe
it
is
because
of
my
lack
of
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
mandley
i.
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
review
the
mandley
ii
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
to
they
did
not
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
it,
is
it
not?
whether
illinois
can
permissibly
do
what
it
is
now
doing
under
afdc?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
a
federal
question?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
is
maybe
a
failure
of
protocol
or
courtesy,
but
i
am
asking
what
issues
are
before
us?
is
it
not
just
the
permissibility
under
afdc
of
what
illinois
is
now
doing?
you
concede,
do
you
not,
that
any
state
can
abandon
an
ea
program,
it
is
a
voluntary
program,
it
can
go
into
it
and
it
can
go
out
of
it,
can
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
why
is
that
a
concern
of
ours,
the
law
of
illinois?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
question,
whether
quite
apart
from
previous
history,
whether
a
state
right
now
can
under
afdc
authority
do
what
illinois
is
doing
or
must
it
do
more?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
emergency
disaster
program?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
limited
to
30
days
in
any
twelve-months
period
and
the
state
can
set
the
need
and
the
amount?
justice
potter
stewart
for
evictions
or
casualty
losses
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
but
resulting
from
emergency
catastrophes,
is
it
not,
or
individual
catastrophes,
it
does
not
have
to
be
--?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
what
this
legislation
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
less
than
the
full?
justice
potter
stewart
so
all
of
those
12
would
be
in
violation
under
mandley
i,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
are
here
by
reason
of
a
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
cases
present
two
questions
concerning
the
validity
of
public
assistance
programs
that
illinois
operates
with
federal
funds
under
title
iv-a
of
the
federal
social
security
act.
the
litigation
originated
as
a
challenge
to
the
state's
program
of
emergency
assistance
to
needy
families
with
children.
the
social
security
act
as
amended
in
1968
makes
federal
funds
available
for
state
programs
of
emergency
aid
to
families
that
are
threatened
with
destitution
for
any
reason,
even
if
they
are
not
eligible
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
known
as
afdc.
illinois,
however,
elected
to
provide
emergency
aid
only
to
families
who
were
also
eligible
for
afdc
and
only
if
their
need
was
the
result
of
certain
specified
events.
the
court
of
appeals,
reversing
the
district
court,
first
held
that
illinois'
emergency
assistance
program
was
invalid
because
it
limited
eligibility
for
such
assistance
more
narrowly
than
the
federal
statute.
the
state
then
announced
it's
intention
to
withdraw
from
the
emergency
assistance
program.
it
proposed
instead
to
provide
the
same
limited
type
of
assistance
under
an
afdc
special
needs
program.
the
plaintiffs
asserted
that
this
program
was
invalid
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
emergency
assistance
program
was
invalid
and
in
a
subsequent
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
it
held
that
the
proposed
afdc
special
needs
program
was
a
de
facto
emergency
assistance
program
and
that
the
state
was
therefore
required
to
extend
aid
to
all
persons
eligible
under
the
federal
law
under
that
program.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
a
fairly
lengthy
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
both
scores.
there
is
nothing
in
the
policies
or
history
of
the
emergency
assistance
provision
to
indicate
that
illinois'
proposed
afdc
special
needs
program
must
meet
the
requirements
of
an
emergency
assistance
program.
and
judged
solely
under
the
requirements
of
afdc
itself,
illinois'
proposed
plan
to
meet
certain
emergency
needs
of
afdc
recipients
is
not
necessarily
improper
simply
because
it
addresses
non-recurring
needs
that
could
alternatively
be
provided
for
under
an
emergency
assistance
program.
in
addition,
we
hold
that
the
social
security
act
does
not
impose
mandatory
eligibility
standards
on
states
that
elect
to
participate
in
the
emergency
assistance
program.
therefore,
illinois
is
not
precluded
from
receiving
federal
funds
for
either
an
emergency
assistance
program
or
a
special
needs
program
under
afdc
simply
because
it
limits
eligibility
for
aid
more
narrowly
than
the
social
security
act.
accordingly
the
judgments
are
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
