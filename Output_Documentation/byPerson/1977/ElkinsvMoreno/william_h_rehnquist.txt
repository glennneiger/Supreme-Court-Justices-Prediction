justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
feldman,
you
say
in
its
unvarnished
state,
at
least
you're
older
in
that
position
here
is
not
as
--
that
this
case
is
different
than
vlandis
against
kline.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
--
in
other
words,
you
would
be
saying
that
for
purposes
of
maryland
in-state
tuition
regulations
and
nonimmigrant
alien
simply
by
definition
can't
qualify.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore
a
vlandis
type
inquiry,
at
least
under
this
hypothesis,
which
shed
no
light
on
anything
at
this
state
uses
in
the
term
making
its
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
i
said
vlandis
type
inquiry,
i
meant
the
type
of
inquiry
mandated
in
vlandis
to
consider
individual
circumstances.
your
position
is
that
nothing
that
such
an
inquiry
would
turn
up,
would
do
these
particular
respondents
any
good
because
they
are
by
rule
forbidden
from
acquiring
in-state
tuition
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
feldman,
if
there
were
to
be
certification,
should
the
question
be,
what
is
the
general
maryland
law
of
domicile
or
what
policy
is
the
university
permitted
to
adopt
with
respect
to
in-state
tuition
fees
under
the
law
of
maryland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
the
certification
simply
ask
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
whether
the
regions
had
the
authority
under
maryland
law
to
make
that
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
your
position
also
the
university's
position
by
the
rule
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
maryland
law
of
domicile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
have
choose
between
a
statement
of
a
written
general
policy
and
a
letter
from
dr.
elkins
is
that
--
what
is
the
university
policy,
which
you
think
we
should
choose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
have
these
hearings
mr.
scanlan,
what
section
of
the
general
policy
is
it
that
you
offered
evidence
on
that
you
can
comply
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
general
policy
on
page
7
of
petitioner's
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
--
i
don't
mean
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
–
you
--
well,
yeah,
you
couldn't
satisfy
the
criterion
that
they
were
immigrant,
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
like
–
that's
like
saying
that
if
a
taxi
driver
statute
that
requires
a
minimum
age
of
21,
your
–
you
–
your
client
is
18
you
are
going
for
a
hearing
and
they
don't
listen
to
his
evidence
of
disqualification
because
they
find
out
he
is
not
21.
