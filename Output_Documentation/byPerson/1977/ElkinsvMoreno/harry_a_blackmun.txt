mr.
feldman,
did
the
district
court
find
that
the
--
what
the
maryland
law
was
with
respect
to
domicile?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
--
the
district
court
–
the
district
court
has
already
answered
the
question
that
–
that
there
has
been
a
suggestion
it
should
be
certified
to
the
maryland
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
the
--
the
district
court
though
has
says
that
under
--
as
it
understands
maryland
law,
g-4s
are
not
forbidden
or
not
precluded
from
becoming
domiciliaries.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
--
you
--
you
disagree
with
that
interpretation
in
maryland
law,
i
take
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
then,
why
should
we
--
if
we
--
let's
assume
we
were
just
bound
with
--
to
the
--
to
take
the
district
court's
view
on
maryland
law,
what
should
we
do?
we
should
just
affirm,
shouldn't
we?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that
the
–
did
the
district
court
reach
--
didn't
reach
those
questions?
