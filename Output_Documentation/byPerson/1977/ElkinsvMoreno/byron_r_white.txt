justice

what
do
you
mean
by
permanent
residents?
is
that
the
term
regarding
the
immigration
laws?
it
means
you
can
stay
as
long
as
you
--
forever
if
you
want
it.
justice
byron

white
where
you
will
get
to
it
but
that
probably
has
too
much
connection
with
domiciles.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
measure
entitlement
by
domicile,
by
definition,
the
maryland
can
say
that
you
can
never
be
a
domicile
here
because
of
the
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
presumption
is
always
true
as
brother
rehnquist
says.
presumption
is
always
true
so
there's
no
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
under
misapprehension,
but
are
there
not
immigrant
aliens
who
enjoy
income
tax
immunity
and
nevertheless
able
to
qualifies
in-state
students
in
maryland?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
enjoy
income
tax
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
the
middle
level
ibm
executive
for
example
that
has
moved
10
times
in
the
last
10
years
and
expects
to
move
10
times
more,
and
come
to
reside
in
maryland
for
--
he
thinks
probably
as
hitch
there
will
be
two
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
they'll
probably
going
to
give
him
an
in-state
tuition,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
scanlan,
can
i
--
can
i
interrupt
for
you
for
a
moment?
you
rely
on
the
nyquist
case
rather
heavily.
there
of
course
the
discrimination
as
against
all
aliens.
it
was
held
that
only
particular
class
were
the
victims
of
an
illegal
but
were
non-constitutional
discrimination,
but
as
i
remembered
all
aliens
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
get
the
student
loans
and
the
like,
was
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
let
me
--
let
me
pursue
it
just
a
moment
if
i
may.
i
have
in
mind
the
diaz
case
a
couple
of
years
ago
where
the
court
said
that
you
don't
have
to
treat
all
aliens
as
citizens
but
you
may
draw
a
line
somewhere
along
the
--
the
spectrum
of
alien
agency.
some
are
close
enough
to
being
citizens
that
we'll
let
them
in
and
you
just
have
to
pick
a
line
somewhere.
now,
you
would
not
say,
i
take
it
you're
saying
your
people
are
enough
like
permanent
residents
so
they
ought
to
be
treated
that
way
but
you
don't
say
the
children
of
ambassadors
are
a
little
farther
down
the
line
wouldn't
have
to
be.
isn't
it
true
that
the
university
is
entitle
to
draw
some
line
and
when
we
get
real
close
to
that
line
it's
going
to
have
an
appearance
of
arbitrariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
it
entitled
to
draw
the
line
permanent
resident
that
just
the
way
the
first
paragraph
where
their
general
policy
does?
immigrant
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
really
doesn't
–
that
really
doesn't
quite
responded
the
question,
because
i
think
you
would
conceive
that
the
university
would
not
have
to
admit
all
aliens,
say,
illegal
aliens
or
persons
here
on
a
temporary
visas,
you
wouldn't
contend
that
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
further
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
constitution
doesn't
–
doesn't
require
domicile
to
be
the
test.
you
don't
say
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
not
used
--
i
used
i
was
under
misapprehension
before
the
argument
started.
the
--
they
have
not
used
domicile
as
the
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
general
policy
quoted
on
page
7
of
the
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
use
domicile
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
letter
–
his
letter
on
page
22
(a)
says,
“the
tuition
rate
is
determined
mainly
by
domicile.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
--
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
you
would
say
that
if
the
general
policy
as
written
applied
to
citizens,
immigrant
aliens,
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
and
g-4
visa
people
then
it
would
be
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it
been
equally
unfair
to
the
nicaraguan
ambassador?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
there's
a
constitutional
difference
between
diplomatic
immunity
for
tort
liability
and
bank
employee
immunity
protects
liability,
the
maryland
can't
draw
the
line
right
there.
