mr.
david
h.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
now
before
you,
the
petitioner,
the
president
of
the
university
of
maryland,
urges
this
court
to
preserve
the
rational
system
of
assigning
tuition
to
students
that
prevails
at
most
public
colleges
in
universities
across
the
nation.
following
the
1973
decision
of
this
court
in
vlandis
against
kline,
public
institutions
of
higher
education
adopted
new
policies
for
determining
students'
admission,
tuition
rates,
and
other
charges.
the
policy
is
adopted
by
the
university
of
maryland
and
most
other
publicly
supported
schools
look
not
only
to
the
domicile
of
the
students
in
granting
preferential
in-state
status,
but
also
are
predicated
on
a
number
of
legitimate
grounds
for
according
differential
consideration
in
defining
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
lower
fees.
thus,
while
the
policy
of
the
university
of
maryland
generally
looks
to
who
is
financially
responsible
for
bearing
a
student's
education
on
other
cost
and
then
looks
to
the
domicile
that
person
whether
it
be
the
student,
his
parent,
or
spouse.
in
order
to
accommodate
the
legitimate
and
preserved
by
the
policy,
it
recognizes
that
variations
from
the
general
applications
are
both
necessary
and
appropriate.
for
example,
both
resident
students
and
permanent
resident
aliens
can
and
do
qualify
for
in-state
status
at
the
university
of
maryland.
by
contrast,
nonresident
citizens
and
nonimmigrant
aliens
are
denied
preferential
treatment.
similarly,
the
university's
policy
denies
its
benefits
to
a
group
of
citizens
whose
association
with
and
contributions
to
the
state
are
likely
to
the
minimal
and
transitory,
specifically
to
those
members
of
the
armed
forces
who
come
to
the
university
not
by
choice
but
by
assignment
for
educational
purposes.
in
may
1975,
respondents,
three
undergraduate
students
at
the
university
of
maryland,
filed
this
action
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
in
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
each
was
financially
dependent
on
his
father,
an
employee
of
an
international
bank
in
washington
d.c.
who
held
as
did
his
child
a
nonimmigrant
g-4
visa.
g-4
nonimmigrant
visas
are
given
to
officers
or
employees
of
international
organizations
and
the
members
of
their
immediate
families.
as
one
seeking
to
be
a
nonimmigrant
alien,
a
person
applying
for
a
g-4
visa
must
state
under
oath
the
purpose
and
length
of
his
intended
stay
in
the
united
states
can
be
admitted
only
for
such
time
and
under
such
conditions
as
the
attorney
general
made
by
regulations
prescribed,
and
is
required
by
the
applicable
regulations
to
agree
to
abide
by
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
admission
and
to
depart
at
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
his
admission
for
the
abandonment
of
his
authorized
nonimmigrant
status.
such
nonimmigrants
are
decisively
disqualified
by
federal
law
from
establishing
a
permanent
residence
in
this
country
because
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
accords
a
privilege
of
residing
permanently
in
the
united
states,
only
to
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
in
the
district
court,
represented
by
council
retained
by
the
international
banks
for
which
their
fathers
worked,
respondents
urged
that
the
university's
policy
of
denying
in-state
status
to
the
holders
of
g-4
nonimmigrant
visas
where
those
financially
dependent
on
the
holders
such
visas.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
--
that
is
correct,
that
is
a
reference
to
section
1101
(a)
(20)
of
title
20
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
it
was
--
has
been
suggested
both
by
the
court's
majority
opinion
in
nyquist
against
mauclet
last
term
and
particularly
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
that
case
that
aliens
who
are
nonimmigrants
are
under
a
disability
from
being
domiciled
in
this
country
or
at
least
most
categories
of
aliens
who
are
nonimmigrants
and
for
that
matter
that
is
a
factor
which
is
conceded
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
as
i'll
connote
later
during
the
argument.
respondents
urged
in
the
district
court
that
the
university's
policy
of
denying
in-state
status
to
them
violated
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
held
in
july
1976,
that
the
university's
policy
as
applied
to
g-4
nonimmigrant
visa
holders,
created
a
permanent
irrebuttable
presumption
of
nondomicile
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
thus
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
equal
protection
claim
now
reasserted
here
by
the
respondents.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
--
that
is
correct
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
--
i
think
that
is
clear
from
the
conditions
of
their
admission
to
this
country
both
by
virtue
of
their
nonimmigrant
status
and
by
virtue
of
the
regulation
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
requiring
them
to
depart
at
the
conclusion
of
their
authorized
admission.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
think
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
--
they
would
not
be
authorized
to
apply
for
citizenship
while
in
this
status.
they
would
be
required
to
adjust
their
status
to
that
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
and
then
they
would
be
subject
to
the
five-year
requirement
which
usually
apply.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
correct.
that
the
district
court
relied
upon
vlandis
versus
kline
in
its
unvarnished
state
that
is
without
reference
to
this
court's
numerous
decisions
dealing
with
state
classifications
or
other
irrebuttable
presumptions
not
affecting
fundamental
rights.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
yes.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
even
if
vlandis
had
not
been
reinterpreted
by
weinberger
against
salfi
in
subsequent
decisions
of
these
court
that
the
presumption
said
to
be
an
issue
in
this
case,
one,
is
not
permanent
in
the
sense
of
vlandis
against
kline.
and
two,
entirely
apart
from
that,
that
the
presumption
said
to
be
an
issue
is
universally
true
and
therefore
not
prohibited
under
vlandis
against
kline.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
position
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
our
position.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
well,
i
think
the
vlandis
type
inquiry
does
not
preclude
the
state
from
shelling
that
there
are
legitimate
policy
objectives
of
the
state
in
constructing
its
policy
and
in
essentially
defining
domicile
in
such
a
way
as
to
preclude
these
persons
consistent
with
federal
law
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
our
position.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
would
be
true,
only
so
long
as
those
persons
did
not
adjust
their
status
to
that
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
well,
i
think
it
is
entirely
possible
that
the
university
would
change
its
policy.
however,
i
think
petitioner's
position
in
the
matter
would
be
that
the
university
would
still
not
be
required
to
change
the
policy,
the
reason
being
that
there
are
other
legitimate
objectives
of
the
policy
such
as
cost
equalization
and
according
preferential
treatment
only
to
those
who
are
liable
for
payment
of
a
full
spectrum
of
state
taxes
that
would
adjust
to
this
case.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
--
that
would
be
true
only
if
the
university's
only
objective
in
having
its
policy
with
the
determined
domicile
and
the
point
that
i've
been
trying
to
make
to
your
honor
is
there
are
other
legitimate
policy
objectives
which
are
taken
into
account
in
the
university's
construction
of
its
policy.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
well,
that
is
the
position
of
the
university
but
it
is
further
the
position
of
petitioner
in
this
case
that
that
is
not
the
only
basis
on
which
the
university's
policy
rests.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
there
are
no
maryland
decisions
one
way
or
the
other
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
no,
on
the
contrary,
in
the
district
court
and
further
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit,
the
university
took
the
position
that
the
federal
courts
should
abstain
on
the
question
of
whether
persons
holding
g-4
visas
were
in
fact
capable
of
acquiring
maryland
domicile
in
favor
of
the
decision
of
a
maryland
court.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
yes,
this
court
could
do
that.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i'm
not
urging
the
court
to
do
that
principally
because
i
think
the
university
is
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
certainly
not.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
think
it
should
probably
be
the
latter
question
because
the
policy
of
the
university
does
try
to
take
account
of
other
factors
in
addition
to
domicile
in
determining
who
appropriately
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
lower
tuition
fees.
i
think
the
difficulty
that
however
that
is
potentially
raised
with
certifying
the
second
question,
is
it
essentially
asks
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
to
make
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
as
a
policy
decision
which
is
more
properly
entrusted
to
the
regions
of
the
university.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
if
that
were
the
question
certified
to
the
court,
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
internally
appropriate.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
if
the
court,
please
and
if,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stevens
please,
that
that
is
not
entirely
the
case
and
the
fact
that
--
or
the
proof
of
that
is
seen
by
reference
to
the
university's
general
policy
which
is
reprinted
in
the
brief
of
petitioner
at
page
7.
and
first,
i
might
note
that
it
is
the
general
policy
which
is
described
there,
not
only
the
focused
sole
reason
for
what
the
policy
is.
but
in
that
regard,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
paragraph
1
subsection
d,
which
in
a
list
of
classes
to
which
in-state
status
is
accorded
indicates
that
such
status
is
available
where
a
student
who
is
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
is
stationed
on
act
of
duty
in
maryland
for
at
least
six
consecutive
months
immediately
prior
to
the
last
day
available
for
registration
for
the
forthcoming
semester,
unless
such
student
has
been
assigned
for
educational
purposes
to
attend
the
university
of
maryland.
i
would
submit
that
such
a
student
assigned
for
educational
purposes
to
the
university
of
maryland
might
will
himself
have
been
before
entering
the
service
and
while
in
the
service
of
domiciliary
of
maryland,
but
the
regents
had
taken
the
position
in
that
case
since
the
federal
government
is
bearing
the
cost
of
the
student's
education
and
in
particularly,
military
department
of
the
federal
government,
that
in
that
instance
it
is
not
appropriate
to
accord
in-state
fees
without
reference
to
domicile.
and
i
--
i
think
that
is
a
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
only
correct
in
so
far
as
the
general
classification
is
concern.
it
is
not
true
in
the
instance
of
both
members
of
the
military
assigned
for
educational
purposes
rather
than
coming
by
choice.
it
is
further
not
true
in
the
case
of
nonimmigrant
aliens
the
overwhelming
majority
of
which
if
not
all
of
which
we
believed
to
be
under
a
legal
disability
from
being
domiciled
in
a
state.
but
the
basis
with
respect
to
nonimmigrant
aliens
is
as
to
those
who
are
--
for
example,
on
student
visas
or
on
other
transitory
states
in
the
united
states
that
their
relationship
to
the
state
and
their
liability
for
the
full
payment
of
state
taxes,
if
any,
will
be
fleeting
at
most,
so
that
in
the
long
run,
their
contribution
to
the
university
will
not
be
particularly
great.
in
the
case
of
g-4
nonimmigrant
visa
holders
and
diplomats,
for
example,
who
would
be
a
similar
category
such
persons
are
under
no
liability
to
pay
federal
or
state
income
taxation,
and
because
of
their
non-liability
for
payment
of
the
full
spectrum
of
taxes,
their
contributions
to
the
university
in
the
long
run
would
be
minimal
as
well.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
think
the
odds
are,
are
reasonably
high
that
the
case
would
become
moot
because
the
university
would
change
its
policy,
but
that
policy
judgment
is
one
that
would
be
made
by
the
regents.
and
i
have
suggested
previously
and
i
would
again
that
i
think
it
is
–
well,
within
the
discretion
of
the
regents
in
terms
of
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
it
would
not
because
the
existing
policy
specifically
precludes
from
eligibility
persons
not
united
states
citizens
or
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
that
preambulatory
language
is
part
of
the
first
paragraph
of
the
general
policy
has
currently
written.
the
general
policy
as
currently
written
says,
“it
is
the
policy
of
the
university
to
grant
in-state
status
for
admission
tuition
and
charge
differential
purposes
to
united
states
citizens
and
to
immigrant
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
the
following
cases.”
and
then
they
are
listed.
so,
there
are
still
would
be
a
requirement
of
the
policy
as
being
amended.
i
try
to
suggest
previously
by
one
of
my
remarks
that
we
believe
vlandis
against
kline
not
to
be
the
same
case
as
it
was
in
1973
in
any
event,
and
that
the
university's
policy
premises
need
not
to
be
universally
true
or
perfect
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
because
1(a)
is
a
specific
subcategory
of
one
which
limits
a
and
specifically
says
it
is
only
the
policy
with
respect
to
united
states
citizens
and
to
immigrant
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
and
the
g-4
are
neither
of
those
categories.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
as
this
court
indicated
last
term
califano
versus
jobst
state
classifications
are
not
gauged
properly
by
focusing
on
selected
atypical
examples
of
the
class.
starting
with
weinberger
versus
salfi
in
1975,
two
years
before,
a
long
and
unbroken
line
of
this
court's
decisions
makes
clear
that
state
classifications
not
affecting
fundamental
rights
do
not
create
unconstitutional
irrebuttable
presumptions
or
otherwise
violates
due
process
clause
if
rationally
related
to
legitimate
governmental
objectives.
obviously,
a
claim
of
a
preferred
tuition
rate,
whether
or
not
the
excess
is
paid
by
parent's
international
bank
employer,
does
not
involve
a
basic
human
liberty
or
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
and
thus,
many
legitimate
grounds
proffered
by
petitioner
in
this
case
are
more
than
sufficient.
before
discussing
this
rationale
basis,
perhaps
a
word
or
two
should
be
said
about
salfi.
salfi
involved
an
irrebuttable
presumption
in
the
social
security
act
which
effectively
held
marriages
lasting
less
than
nine
months
to
be
shams
and
denied
benefits.
absent
from
the
court's
opinion
was
any
language
of
strict
scrutiny
or
at
least
restrictive
alternative
and
the
focus
was
upon
starns
versus
malkerson
where
the
court
said,
what
we
believe
should
be
restated
in
this
case,
“the
benefits
here
are
available
upon
compliance
with
an
objective
criterion,
one
which
the
legislature
considered
to
bare
a
sufficiently
close
nexus
with
underlying
policy
objectives
to
be
used
as
a
test
for
eligibility.”
like
the
plaintiff
in
starns,
appellees
are
completely
free
to
present
evidence
that
they
need
to
specific
requirements.
feeling
in
this
effort,
their
only
constitutional
claim
is
that
the
test
they
cannot
meet
is
not
so
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
legislative
objective
that
it
can
be
used
to
deprive
them
of
benefits
available
to
those
who
do
satisfied
the
test.
and
in
the
usery
versus
turner
case,
a
year
later,
the
court
indicated
that
whether
or
not
a
classification
stated
an
irrebuttable
presumption
on
its
base
was
irrelevant
when
its
operation
and
the
fact
were
completely
permissible.
similarly
in
califano
versus
jobst
and
the
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
versus
murgia
cases
of
last
year
and
the
year
before,
the
court
sustained
what
we
were
obvious
facial
or
otherwise
irrebuttable
presumptions.
despite
the
fact
that
in
murgia,
an
administrative
device
existed
but
was
not
used
and
annual
physical
examination
to
inquire
into
the
factual
matter
that
was
presumed
namely
that
policeman
were
unfit
to
serve
at
age
50.
just
how
little
is
left
of
the
irrebuttable
presumption
doctrine
was
made
clear
by
mr.
justice
blackmun's
opinion
for
unanimous
court
in
ohio
bureau
of
employment
services
versus
hodory
from
the
last
term,
a
case
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
before
this
court
in
this
case
but
one
which
we
now
believe
to
be
particularly
relevant.
there
are
three-judge
court
and
had
invalidated
on
equal
protection
and
due
process
ground,
and
ohio
statute
denying
an
employment
compensation
other
than
because
of
a
lockout
of
an
employer.
in
reversing
the
district
court,
this
court
noted
that
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
its
fund
and
dismissed
the
irrebuttable
presumption
claim
on
a
footnote
stating,
“this
argument
requires
several
assumptions.
first,
appellee
must
assume
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
measure
innocence.
then,
he
must
assume
that
the
disqualification
provision
represents
a
presumption
that
any
person
laid
off
due
to
a
strike
is
not
innocent.
if
the
statute
is
designed
to
serve
any
purpose
other
than
measuring
innocence,
appellee's
implication
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption
fails.
as
we
discussed
below,
the
statute
clearly
has
purposes
other
than
measuring
the
innocence
of
the
disqualified
worker.”
similarly,
the
policies
of
the
university
of
maryland
and
at
most
other
public
institutions
or
prior
education
which
deny
in-state
status
to
nonimmigrant
aliens
have
a
number
of
purposes
other
than
the
measure
of
domicile.
these
policies
effect
a
recent
decision
to
equalize
the
cost
of
college
and
university
training
between
those
with
continuing
liability
to
support
public
higher
education
by
paying
the
full
spectrums
of
state
taxes
and
those
such
as
nonimmigrant
employees
of
the
international
banks
who
do
not
have
that
obligation.
tuition
payments
at
public
institutions
of
higher
education
represent
only
a
portion
of
a
true
cost
and
the
amount
available
for
state
subsidized
educational
benefit
is
not
limitless.
it
is
note
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
under
the
maryland
law
of
domicile
g-4s
were
not
precluded
from
being
domiciled
in
maryland.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
it
--
it
has
answered
the
first
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested
was
a
possibility.
namely,
whether
as
a
matter
of
theory,
g-4s
could
be
domiciled.
it
has
not
answered
his
second
question
which
i
think
he
suggested
was
a
preferred
question.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
--
that
was
the
district
court's
conclusion,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
--
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
to
be
the
case
and
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
now
namely
that
the
university's
policies
served
many
purposes
other
than
measuring
domicile
and
i'm
trying
to
get
to
those
in
the
few
brief
seconds
that
i
have.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
right
because
on
the
district
court's
finding,
it
determined
that
there
was
a
permanent
irrebuttable
presumption
under
vlandis
without
--
that
was
not
universally
true,
without
reference
to
the
later
cases
which
cast
out
on
those
requirements.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
that
--
that
is
our
position
because
the
policy
serves
other
purposes
is
clearly
intended
to
serve
other
purposes.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
no,
the
district
court
never
--
never
reach
those
questions
because
of
its
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
university's
policy
in
addition
to
favoring
those
with
continuing
liability
to
support
public
higher
education
by
the
payment
of
the
full
spectrum
of
state
taxes
also
encourages,
they
even
handed
an
efficient
administration
of
its
in-state
determination
and
appeals
process
limiting
hearings
for
its
550
nonimmigrant
students
to
the
objective
criterion
of
changes
in
their
immigration
status
and
reducing
the
need
for
full-blown
hearing
as
many
requiring
interpreters.
if
respondent's
arguments
are
accepted,
the
university's
rational
dividing
line
will
give
way
principally
in
favor
of
employees
described
recently
by
a
senate
committee
as
possessors
of
sinecures
where
extraordinarily
high
salaries
are
common
place
in
pursuit
of
cringe
benefits
has
been
raised
to
a
form
of
art.
it
is
the
less
fortunate
categories
of
g-4
aliens
that
will
left
out
in
the
cold
(inaudible)
respondent's
arguments
are
accepted.
the
university's
policy
in
those
most
other
public
institutions
serve
all
of
the
purposes
noted.
they
do
not
measure
domicile
only
or
view
it
in
a
vacuum
and
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
the
university's
policy
as
a
general
matter
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
no,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
those
persons
who
have
given
preferential
treatment
by
the
university
are
those
liable
for
the
full
payment
of
the
full
spectrum
of
--
of
state
taxes,
whereas
those
who
are
not
favored
out
of
staters,
nonimmigrant
aliens,
those
who
pass
through
the
state
for
short
periods
or
in
the
case
of
the
g-4s
are
not
liable
for
taxes
don't
receive
the
benefit
for
that
reason
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
--
because
the
case
is
already
subsidizing
them
by
not
charging
them
income
taxes.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
it
--
it
is
not
totally
irrelevant
because
it
is
generally
those
persons
who
are
liable
to
--
for
the
full
spectrum
of
taxes
who
were
given
the
preferential
treatment.
it
is
true
that
the
policy
does
not
look
in
individual
cases
as
to
whether
an
individual
has
in
fact,
pay
those
taxes
or
is
in
fact
liable
for
them
because
he
has
made
enough
money.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
yes,
that
is
specifically
the
point
that
was
made
in
nyquist
against
mauclet
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
mauclet.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
no,
the
--
these
people
would
not
because
it
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
these
people
i
think
it
is
clear
(inaudible)
by
treaty.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
well,
i
–-
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
under
the
present
law
persons
who
are
here
on
g-4
visas
are
not
liable
for
military
service
or
not
liable
for
federal
or
state
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
–
that
would
be
true
even
if
they
would
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
that
is
correct.
i
believe
my
time
is
up
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
haven't
got
into
the
one
or
two
other
points
that
i'd
hoped
to
make
but
i'd
be
happy
to
respond
to
your
question.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
are
immigrant
aliens
who
enjoy
income
tax
liability.
as
an
example,
if
g-4
in
this
--
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
david
h.
feldman
i
--
i
misspoke
myself.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
are
immigrants
who
enjoy
immunity
and
in
fact
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
a
position
of
respondents
that
even
were
they
to
adjust
their
status
to
that
of
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents
that
if
they
continue
to
work
for
the
international
banks,
they
would
still
not
be
subject
to
federal
or
state
income
taxation.
and
i
think
the
only
point
to
be
made
with
respect
to
that
is
that
if
you
focus
in
on
that,
you
are
focusing
in
on
the
atypical
examples
which
this
court
indicated
were
not
pertinent
in
califano
versus
jobst,
and
then
as
a
general
matter,
nonimmigrants
are
subject
to
the
full
spectrum
of
taxes.
