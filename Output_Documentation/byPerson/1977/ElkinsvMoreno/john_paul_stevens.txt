justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing
on
my
own
mind.
you
suggest
that
the
present
rule
may
rest
either
on
a
domicile
test
or
on
this
other
consideration
such
as
paying
the
full
range
of
taxes.
is
it
not
correct
that
the
rule
of
this
actually
an
issue
is
one
based
on
domicile
only?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
under
the
impression
--
maybe
i
--
i
may
not
have
completely
followed
that,
that
every
person
who
could
establish
that
he
was
a
domicile,
he
or
she
was
a
domiciliary
of
maryland,
would
be
treated
as
an
in-state
applicant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
--
put
the
question
just
a
little
differently.
if
we
did
certify
to
the,
the
domiciliary
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland
and
they
came
back
with
an
answer
that
said
that
g-4
--
a
person
with
the
g-4
visa
is
capable
of
forming
the
requisite
intent
to
establish
domicile,
what
would
happen
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
that
if
it
changed
its
policy,
wouldn't
it
just
apply
its
existing
policy
and
say
that
some
of
these
people
would
then
be
eligible
to
be
considered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
i'm
sorry
it
takes
so
much
time,
but
i
-–
i
really
--
i
don't
–-
i
don't
understand.
i
read
paragraph
1(a)
of
that
paragraph
and
why
if
the
maryland
court
told
us
that
the
parents
were
domicile
and
the
child,
why
doesn't
1(a)
entitle
a
student
to
admission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
i
don't
understand
how
a
service
of
policy
have
been
encouraging
the
payment
of
taxes.
these
people
are
not
going
to
pay
taxes
no
matter
what
the
university
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
somebody
is
putting
the
favor,
not
pay
his
taxes
depending
on
the
result
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
case
of
any
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
case
of
any
permanent
resident
alien
or
any
citizen,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
pays
any
taxes
is
totally
irrelevant
to
your
standards
of
whether
it
is
admitted,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
immunity
exception.
