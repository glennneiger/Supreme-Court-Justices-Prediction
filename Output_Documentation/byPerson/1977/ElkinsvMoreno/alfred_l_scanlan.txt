mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
three
young
students
of
the
university
of
maryland
and
their
family,
i
think
who
are
named
as
plaintiffs
in
this
case
and
respondents
to
this
court,
are
typical
of
--
most
of
the
members
of
the
class
for
which
i
speak
today.
their
parents
have
own
property
in
maryland
ranging
from
seven
to
15
years.
they
pay
every
single
tax
levied
by
the
state
of
maryland
except
the
income
tax
on
their
salaries,
which
they
cannot
do
because
by
international
agreement
treaty
if
you
will,
that
income
is
exempt
from
federal
and
state
income
taxation.
they've
lived
here
many
years
in
two
of
the
three
cases
they
have
attended
elementary
schools
and
secondary
schools
public
and
parochial
without
interruption.
one
of
them
has
a
mother
who
is
in
maryland
--
an
american
citizen
and
can
vote
in
american
elections.
they
have
no
property,
their
parents
i
mean,
no
property
back
home.
one
exception
is
a
small
bank
account
in
england
that
pays
insurance.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i
could
see
where
would
make
it
--
there
would
be
a
difference
in
the
ability
to
show
domicile
if
you
have
chateau
in
bolivia
and
return
there
every
year.
but
all
we
are
asking
for
you,
your
honor,
is
the
opportunity,
just
the
opportunity
to
prove
domicile,
but
the
university
says,
“no,
you
are
not
going
to
have
that
opportunity.
you
have
a
g-4
visa.”
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
prior
in
september
1973,
the
policy
was
a
rational
policy,
if
you
owned
and
occupy
real
estate
in
the
state
of
maryland,
you
could
satisfy
the
test.
but
since
1973
the
test
has
been
the
domicile
test
despite
the
embellishments
my
adversary
would
like
to
lay
upon
that
test
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
all
of
their
briefs,
they've
said,
“domicile,
it
was
a
test,
not
alienage
but
domicile.”
by
the
solicitor
attorney
general
feldman's
argument
was
consumed
in
trying
to
convince
you
that
vlandis
is
inapplicable
or
vlandis
should
be
thrown
aside.
and
he
did
not
reach
another
issue
that
we
argued
as
he
concedes
not
only
in
the
district
court
but
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
equal
protection
issue.
we
have
a
class
of
aliens
here.
we
think
that
this
court's
holding
of
last
june
in
nyquist
versus
mauclet
is
very
much
in
point.
i
need
not
recite
the
facts
of
that
case
for
you.
you
will
recall
provisions
of
the
new
york
education
act
which
gave
tuition
grants,
and
scholarships,
and
low
interest
loans
to
american
citizens,
and
to
the
people
who
had
applied
for
citizenship,
and
to
people
that
were
willing
to
certify
in
writing
that
they
would
apply
for
citizenship
was
strapped
down.
it's
the
subcategory
of
aliens
despite
new
york's
argument
that
it
didn't
discriminate
–
it
only
discriminated
against
the
heterogeneous
class,
despite
that
argument
in
new
york
this
court
held
a
subcategory
of
aliens
--
was
a
suspect
(inaudible)
i
think
it
said
something
along
the
lines
that
the
policy
in
that
case
the
new
york
education
aid
in
this
case
the
domicile
--
the
refusal
to
--
the
implication
of
non-residency
or
non-domicile
is
directed
at
aliens
only
and
only
aliens
are
harmed
by
it.
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
cut
against
the
whole
category
of
aliens
didn't
say
that
nyquist
versus
mauclet
and
it
shouldn't
say
that
it
--
save
the
situation
here.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
brennan
i
don't
for
the
following
reasons.
in
the
court
below,
they
asked
the
district
court
to
abstain
primarily
on
the
ground
that
it
would
also
support
certification.
the
district
court
went
ahead
and
decided
the
maryland
domicile
question.
the
law
has
clearly
said
that
policy
is
clear.
they
said
in
their
briefs.
we
track
the
maryland
law
of
domicile.
now,
the
maryland
law
of
domicile,
your
honors,
is
that
--
the
traditional
law
of
domicile.
it's
an
intent
primarily
indefinite
to
live
in
maryland.
now,
these
g-4s
has
come
on
--
for
duration
of
status
as
long
as
they
are
employed
by
the
bank
as
i've
said
in
one
case
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh,
yes
it's
an
intent,
an
intent
permanently
and
indefinitely
to
live
with
the
united
states
and
not
to
repair
elsewhere.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
times
when
you
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
it
can
be
permanent
in
the
sense
that
the
present
time
you
tend
to
live
in
this
place
and
no
other
place.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
in
--
among
the
category
of
aliens
mr.
justice
marshall,
among
the
category
of
non-permanent
resident
aliens.
there
are
number
of
categories
and
many
of
them
have
to
sign
the
fact,
the
visas
that
they
have
says
that
it
have
to
maintain
a
residents
abroad
which
they
have
no
intention
of
abandonment.
our
aliens
and
a
few
others
like
corporate
executives,
in
the
foreign
media
and
i
believe
the
treaty
traders,
don't
have
to
say
that.
so,
they
can't
have
an
intention
to
stay
permanently
in
the
united
states
even
though
if
they
should
lose
their
jobs.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
how
likely
that
is
but
if
they
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
no
if
–
if
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
if
–
if
–
for
instance
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
if
the
fire
occurred
where
i
live
now,
i
might
have
to
move
but
that's
an
unlikely
contingency.
at
the
present
time,
i
want
to
stay
where
i
am
and
i
think
all
of
these
people
want
to
show,
i'm
not
saying
all
of
them
are
domicile.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
he's
domicile
in
maryland.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
he
is
domicile
in
maryland.
these
international
civil
servants,
your
honor,
are
very
much
like
some
of
our
federal
employees.
they
come
here
from
idaho
and
nebraska.
some
of
them
maintain
voting
residents
back
in
idaho
and
nebraska,
most
of
them
don't.
they
come
here
and
they
live
and
that's
what
these
people
do.
now,
the
university
says,
“we're
not
discriminating
against
aliens.
our
policy
falls
with
equal
hand
on
all
non-domiciliaries
of
maryland,
citizens
and
aliens
alike.”
they
missed
the
point.
we
are
not
complaining
about
domicile
as
the
test.
what
we
are
complaining
about
his
that
we,
only
we
and
other
non-permanent
aliens
are
excluded
from
taking
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
even
gave
us
a
hearing.
i
represented
two
of
these
children,
of
this
young
people
appearing.
the
same
hearing
anyone
else
got.
they
just
don't
pay
attention
to
our
evidence
because
we
have
a
g-4
visa.
domicile
not
alien
is
the
test
they
say.
but
in
the
end,
they
are
excluding
a
suspect
class
who
are
able
to
show
their
domiciles
here.
i
mean
the
classic
definition
of
domicile
that
comes
into
my
mind
is
just
this
homes
observation
that
the
critical
fact
that
makes
–
that
raises
a
change
of
abode
to
a
change
of
a
domicile
is
the
intention
not
to
reside
anywhere.
the
effort
–
effort
dramatically
summed
up
the
law
of
domicile.
under
that
definition,
these
people
can
show
they're
domiciles.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
that's
right.
the
intention
not
to
–
i
think
it
was
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
in
williamson
versus
osenton.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
now,
may
i
turn
to
a
passing
the
equal
protection
point
which
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
the
court
is
going
to
overturn
the
irrebuttable
presumption
doctrine
or
the
court
is
not
--
is
going
to
say
that
somehow
vlandis
is
not
applicable
to
this
case,
residence
there,
domicile
here,
i
don't
see
the
difference.
but
assume
that
the
court
says,
for
some
reason
that
it
alludes
that
vlandis
is
not
applicable
or
should
be
overturn,
the
court
must
still
face
up
to
the
fact
that
nyquist
versus
mauclet
says,
“you
can't
discriminate
against
a
subclass
of
aliens”
and
we
have
a
subclass
of
aliens.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
people
probably
could
have
passed
the
test
in
nyquist
versus
mauclet.
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
sign
a
paper
that
when
they
are
eligible
for
citizenship
they
would
apply.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh
no,
your
honor,
when
they
--
when
they
reach
for
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh
i
see.
but
the
--
but
the
general
record,
your
honor,
or
at
least
in
the
--
in
the
arguments
to
this
court
and
to
--
in
the
briefs,
i'm
sorry,
i
confuse
the
records
specifically
and
the
record
generally.
it
--
there
is
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
when
these
men,
their
parents
and
the
people
in
this
class,
when
they
reach
retirement
age
at
the
bank
then
can
a
petition
for
adjustment
of
permanent
status
because
at
that
time,
in
that
event
when
they're
about
to
retire
and
they
have
a
pension
coming,
they
don't
have
to
secure
a
labor
certification
form.
and
that
brings
with
you
a
point
that
the
university
has
made
from
the
beginning,
“just
change
your
status,
that's
all
you
have
to
do,
become
a
permanent
alien.
what's
so
tough
about
that?”
we
pointed
out
from
beginning
to
end
what
they
call
are
imaginary
road
blocks.
namely,
the
international
organizations
by
treaty
must
give
due
regard
in
the
geographical
selection
of
the
staff,
the
banks
must
give
due
regard
for
--
i
mean
in
the
selection
of
staff,
the
banks
must
give
due
regard
for
geographical
selection.
secondly,
congress,
the
congress
has
established
the
category
of
visa
for
these
people.
it's
the
g-4
visa.
the
congress
has
spoken.
it's
the
congress
that
said
that
they
can
stay
here
indefinitely
as
long
as
they're
on
the
job.
and
then
finally
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
ambassadorial
status
mr.
chief
justice
is
--
is
a
different
category
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
--
the
ambassador
status
is
like
a
capital
office.
it's
a
temporary
duration.
when
he
fulfills
his
assignment,
a
little
bit
from
(inaudible)
that
was
here
for
long
time
and
probably
with
the
exception
proves
the
rule,
but
generally
a
high
--
high
ranking
diplomats
serve
for
a
shorter
period.
they
are
not
international
civil
service.
they
--
they
have
--
they
have
much
more
broader
diplomatic
privileges,
i
might
add
on
that
subject
mr.
feldman
refer
to
my
client's
class
as
privilege
to
aliens.
they
have
functional
privileges,
yes.
they
are
exempt
from
income
taxation
from
their
salaries.
they
would
not
be
liable
to
protection
in
the
draft.
they
are
exempt
from
alien
registration.
they
are
entitled
to
be
repatriated
if
necessary
in
times
of
international
crisis
and
they
are
free
from
duty
on
their
personal
possessions
when
they
first
come
into
this
country.
that's
all
of
the
privileges
they
have.
these
are
functional
privileges
necessary
in
connection
with
the
work
of
their
organization.
may
i
turn
to
vlandis
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i
think
they're
--
they
--
well,
the
functional
privileges
are
necessary
for
them
to
perform
their
functions
as
an
international
civil
servant,
serving
an
international
agency.
the
critical
thing
in
domicile
owes
is
the
intention.
your
honor,
we
have
a
case
that
we
didn't
cite
to
this
court
but
we
did
cite
it
to
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
--
well,
i
think
it
has
--
(inaudible)
at
296
atlantic,
second
floor
31.
there
was
an
alien
of
a
cultural
exchange
program
which
is
one
of
those
categories,
your
honors,
where
you
have
to
swear
you
are
going
to
maintain
a
residence
abroad
that
you
have
no
intention
of
abandoning.
his
status
had
run
out
but
the
dc
court
of
appeals
said,
“he
had
the
intention
to
be
domicile
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
purposes
of
securing
divorce.”
and
we
have
the
seren
case
that
was
relied
on
--
i
think
our
opponents
cited
and
we
did,
where
university
of
–
of
colorado
student,
foreign
student,
an
f
visa,
an
f
visa
which
again
the
recipient
of
that
visa
has
to
say
that
he
has
no
intention
of
abandoning
his
residence.
this
fellow
obliged
to
in-state
tuition
out
of
colorado.
his
status
run
out
and
they
petition
for
adjustment
of
status,
the
colorado
court
by
properly
i
think
said,
“as
long
he
was
in
that
particular
status
where
he
had
to
maintain
another
domicile.
he
couldn't
be
a
domicile
in
colorado
for
in-state
tuition
status.”
but
when
that
status
expired,
he
could
have
the
intention
to
stay.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
that
this
is
an
(inaudible)
case
in
the
present
case.
these
people
that
i'm
speaking
for,
many
of
them
are
marylanders
in
every
sense
of
the
world.
they
go
to
school,
to
church.
the
only
thing
they
do
--
they
don't
get
is
then
--
they
can't
vote
in
maryland
because
they
are
not
citizen
and
the
university
of
maryland
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh
no
--
oh
no,
your
honor.
all
aliens
are
allowed
to
do
who
would
do
two
things,
who
are
the
category
of
being
eligible
for
citizenship
or
would
sign
a
piece
of
paper
which
said,
“when
they
were
eligible
they
would
apply.”
no,
no.
it
applied
to
a
subcategory
of
aliens,
i.e.
those
who
are
not
eligible
for
citizenship
and
would
not
sign
the
piece
of
paper.
in
our
case
the
subcategory
is
non
--
non-permanent
aliens
specifically
in
our
case,
the
g-4
aliens.
i'm
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
everybody
of
this
other
--
all
of
these
other
categories
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
the
university
is
--
entitled
to
draw
the
line
that
is
drawn
namely
domicile
but
it's
not
entitled
to
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
because
then
they
were
right
back
in
the
equal
protection
point.
the
mathews
versus
diaz
written
by
your
honor
involved
the
federal
power
and
your
–
and
the
court
speak
through
you
mr.
justice
stevens
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
that
case
and
again
in
nyquist.
the
federal
government
can
have
powers
of
classification
over
aliens
in
subclasses
of
aliens
that
are
denied
in
states
because
the
federal
power
is
also
base
on
the
foreign
relations
policy
of
this
country,
which
is
not
on
the
business
of
the
state
much
less
in
the
university
of
maryland.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
no,
i
–
i
would
–
i
would
say
they'll
--
i
would
–
i
would
concede
the
classes
of
aliens
of
the
university
would
be
entitled
to
say,
“well,
on
your
face,
you
cannot
show
your
domiciles
here.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
because
look,
their
visa
says
you
have
an
intention
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh
no,
i'm
not
saying
the
constitution
but
having,
when
a
legislative
body
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh,
that
isn't
so
your
honor.
they
bragged
about
that
from
the
beginning.
this
is
a
belated
after
thought
of
theirs
when
they
realize
they're
hooked
between
aliens
and
domicile.
and
they
want
the
domicile
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
--
yes,
that
–
that
is
the
general
policy.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
your
honor
--
i
rely
on
the
--
in
fact
(inaudible)
themselves
speaking
in
answering
a
letter
--
i
think
it
as
for
me,
i'm
–
i
can't
remember
for
sure.
in
the
appendix,
your
honor
at
page
21
(a)
–
sorry
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
–
the
policy
as
stated
doesn't
--
maybe
doesn't
spell
out
the
fact
that
domicile
is
the
key
factor
except
that
the
policy
contains
the
definition
of
domicile.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
yes,
and
then
he
tries
to
fill
in
the
cost
equalization
factor.
but
the
cost
equalization
factor,
your
honors
–
that
doesn't
hold
up
in
this
case
because
they've
admitted
that
if
any
of
our
people
did
change
--
could
change
their
status
as
(inaudible)
we
do,
they
still
wouldn't
pay
tax
on
their
income
but
they
still
would
be
domicile
in
the
university
of
maryland.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
even
stop
there.
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
a
policy
-
here,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
it's
a
policy
primarily
base
if
not
exclusively
based
on
domicile.
there
is
a
hearing
procedure
provided,
everybody
gets
a
hearing,
except
one
category,
the
non-permanent
immigrants
including
the
g-4s
cannot
--
whatever
evidence
they
offer
on
the
basic
fact,
the
critical
fact
that
the
hearings
all
about,
i.e.
are
you
domiciled
in
maryland?we
can't
a
proof
means
nothing
no
mater
–
no
matter
how
close
that
ties
to
maryland
that
were
able
to
demonstrate
in
a
particular
case,
that
what
we
are
complaining
about,
that's
unfair.
it
seems
to
us
that's
analogous
of
–
it
implicates
procedural
due
process.
the
fact
that
they
could
have
had
a
different
policy
but
did
it
in
a
different
way,
it
didn't
involve
making
a
fact
critical
and
then
having
a
procedural
shortcut
for
the
determination
of
that
class.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh
you
mean
the
(inaudible)
been
here
a
long
time?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
i
–
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
an
ambassador
--
the
ambassadorial
class,
the
diplomatic
class,
their
privileges
and
their
–
their
presence
in
this
country
is
based
on
two
theories,
the
representative
theory
and
the
extraterritoriality
theory.
one,
they
represent
the
sovereign,
their
sovereign
nicaragua
or
two,
they
are
an
extension
of
nicaraguan
territory.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
including
their
car.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
they
are
--
they
are
obviously
--
pardon.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
they
–-
they
are
immune.
now
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
but
if
one
of
–
one
of
these
plaintiffs,
i
mean
one
of
these
respondents
of
their
fathers,
of
their
mothers
hit
anybody
with
the
–-
their
car
in
maryland
or
driving
anywhere
else,
and
they
were
liable,
they
would
pay.
they
--
they
don't
have
that
--
they
don't
have
any
diplomatic
immunity.
they
are
at
different
category.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well
yes
i
am,
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
we
–
we
offered
evidence
about
car
registrations.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
the
criteria
that
they
–
we
try
--
we
couldn't
obviously
satisfy
the
voting
right
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
we
offered
evidence
on
the
other
criteria,
they
still
gave
us
a
hearing
even
though
it
was
catch
22
situation,
of
course.
we
could
have
a
hearing
to
doomsday
but
it
would
be
meaningless.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
it
is
also
like
the
hearing
in
stanley
where
--
i
mean
not
the
hearing
in
stanley,
the
burson
versus
bell
where
there
was
a
pre-suspension
of
licence
hearing
but
that
hearing
was
meaningless
in
the
case
of
a
non-insured
driver.
and
the
court
held
--
having
made
the
fact
of
liability
critical
in
that
case,
it
was
unfair,
violated
due
process
and
call
it
an
irrebuttable
or
conclusive
presumption
if
you
will
and
that
was
wrong.
i'm
not
saying
-–
i'm
not
saying
there
are
many,
many
cases.
it's
only
in
the
case
where
the
conclusive
presumption
is
apparent
in
vlandis
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
here
in
the
(inaudible)
administration
of
the
policy
by
the
university,
where
there
is
apparent
on
the
face
in
that
case,
yes.
i'm
not
urging
that
the
court
go
fair
it
out
irrebuttable
presumptions.
that
would
be
indeed
a
substantive
of
interference
masquerading
in
–
in
a
procedural
dress.
but
-–
and
i'm
not
-–
i'm
not
urging
it
where
the
cost
of
individual
determinations
would
be
prohibited
or
costly.
that
isn't
the
case
here.
they
already
have
the
areas.
we
already
talking
about
--
small
class
53
children
of
the
university
of
maryland,
53.
that
500
figure
obviously
involves
student
visa
people
who
have
to
maintain
a
residence
that
they
have
no
intention
of
abandoning.
and
i'm
not
saying
we
should
have
irrebuttable
presumptions
that
are
wrong
when
there
is
no
other
better
alternative
way
to
determine
the
matter.
i
think
it's
perfectly
valid
to
have
age
classifications
for
driving
license,
voting
rights,
and
drinking
rights,
and
may
be
the
bar
examinations
for
testing
lawyers.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
have
irrebuttable
presumptions
where
that
wouldn't
be
any
better
qualify
--
a
better
qualify
method
to
determine
the
ultimate
fact
like
your
honor
you
mentioned
in
salfi.
the
marital
intent
and
the
life
expectancy
and
knowledge
of
term
and
illness
were
all
on
certain
speculative
matters
perhaps
no
better
determined
in
an
individual
hearing
than
by
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
but
leaving
those
situations
aside,
i
say
that
vlandis
type
of
irrebuttable
presumption
is
proper.
i
say
we
come
four
square
within
vlandis
but
if
we
–
and
i
–
if
–
if
the
court
is
going
to
(inaudible)
vlandis
that's
another
matter.
i
don't
think
they
should.
i
think
the
irrebuttable
presumption
contrary
to
the
charge
made
about
our
analysis
of
it.
it
is
not
dishonest,
it's
a
principle
constitutional
analysis
that
has
applicability
and
can
reconcile
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided.
but
finally,
after
all
about
vlandis,
whether
vlandis
controls,
doesn't
control
or
is
to
be
overruled.
i
say
nyquist
versus
mauclet
controls
and
the
alienist
problem
is
in
this
case
has
been
in
from
the
beginning
we
are
entitled
to
raise
it
here
and
have
raised
it
here.
i
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
have
--
let
me
answer
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
the
district
court
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
by
the
same
reason
you
accepted
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan,
jr.
well,
this
court
held
in
bishop
verus
wood
and
where
you
had
a
district
court
interpretation
in
a
district
where
he
was
familiar
with
the
–
with
the
law
and
that
interpretation
affirm
by
the
circuit
court
there
by
divided
court.
we
have
here
an
interpretation
by
a
district
court
judge
on
a
matter
of
maryland
law
which
seems
clear
on
its
face
the
domicile
test
and
we
have
that
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
i
say
the
same
reason
you
gave
--
