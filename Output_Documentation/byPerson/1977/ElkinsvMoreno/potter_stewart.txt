justice
potter
stewart
mr.
feldman,
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
as
i
understood
your
brief,
you
indicate
that
the
university's
policy
simply
tracks
the
state
law
of
domicile,
the
maryland
law
of
domicile.
that
under
maryland
law,
a
g-4
alien
or
somebody
in
his
family
could
not
be
domiciled
in
maryland
because
they
could
never
have
the
necessary
intent
required
by
maryland
law
to
be
a
domiciliary
thereof.
now
if
it
were
shown,
if
it
were
shown
by
an
authoritative
decision
of
the
maryland
courts,
that
the
maryland
law
is
other
than
which
you
understand
it
to
be
and
represent
it
to
be,
would
the
university
changes
policy
to
confirm,
to
the
then
clear
maryland
law,
or
whether
persistent
to
continue
in
the
present
laws.
justice
potter

--(voice

this
case.
if
--
if
the
university
reports
to
differentiate
intuition
between
domiciliaries
and
nondomiciliaries
and
if
it
were
shown
that
g-4's
could
become
domicilaries
of
maryland
and
if
nonetheless
you
prevented
any
g-4
from
ever
having
the
lower
tuition
right
as
you
would
clearly
have
at
vlandis
case,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now
did
i
misapprehend
that
your
brief
when
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
you
know
more
than
were
following
the
law
of
maryland
as
to
domicile
and
that
under
that
law,
a
g-4
could
never
become
a
domiciliary
of
maryland?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
do
we
know?
we
don't
know
what
the
law
would
be.
we
don't
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
do
have
it,
it
will
require
congress
to
enact
another
law
and
we
don't
know
what
that
law
would
--
could
possibly
be
and
could
we
possibly
know.
justice
potter
stewart
the
intention
not
to
reside
anywhere
else
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
was
a
quotation,
else.
