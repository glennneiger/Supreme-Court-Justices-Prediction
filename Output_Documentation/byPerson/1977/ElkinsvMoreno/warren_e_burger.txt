mr.
feldman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
your
position
is
that
the
united
states
has
never
admitted
these
people
for
permanent
residence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
temporary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
authorized
to
become
citizens?
could
they
apply
for
citizenship
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
while
they're
in
their
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably
they
could
only
apply
but
they
could
not
become
citizen
you
are
saying
while
they
are
in
their
status?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
court
didn't
treat
that
aspect,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

only
about
four
minutes
left
now
to

that
point.
you

not
our

taken
known
to
the
fact
that
they
are
liable
for
taxes,
liable
for
military
duty
if
they're
here
as
permanent
residents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
these
people
be
subject
to
compulsory
military
service
if
we
had
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
basis
of
the
past
law,
you
are
certainly
entitled
to
make
that
representation
if
that's
your
view
of
the
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
compulsory
in
military
service
now
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position
is
that
on
the
law
as
the
last
--
was
before
the
change
there
would
be
--
there

not
be
liable
for
military
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
scanlan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
this
case
if
they
had
a
million
dollar
in
estate
out
in
the
country
or
somewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
any
different
from
saying
that
the
children
or
the
ambassador
of
france
can
stay
here
as
long
as
the
father
is
an
ambassador?
well

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fundamentally
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
it's
different
but
their
both
derived
from
treaties
or
convention.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
aren't
all
those
things

an
indications
of
the
transitory
nature
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
bold
or
whatever
term
you
want
to
picture
with
the
--
just
positive
ones?

justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen

case
is
submitted.

justice
