brennan,

let
me
get
back
in
a
moment
to
mr.
feldman.
there
is
no
--
you
don't
give
us
any
maryland
judicial
decisions
which
hold
or
at
least
any
of
this
positive
which
hold
that
the
g-4's
can
establish
maryland
domicile,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
resist
the
effort
to
certify
to
new
court
of
appeals
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
persist
with
that
position
in
this
court?
i
gather
your
certification
rule,
notwithstanding
what
happened
on
the
lower
courts,
we
could
still
certify.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
your
position
about
that,
should
we
or
should
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
object
to
our
doing
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
scanlan,
do
you
think
we
are
to
certify
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
to
find
out
whether
or
not
g-4
immigrants
can
acquire
domicile
in
maryland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondents
in
the
case
are
students
of
the
university
of
maryland.
each
is
an
alien,
alien
dependent
on
a
parent
living
in
maryland,
who
is
also
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
as
an
employee
of
an
international
bank,
holds
a
non-immigrant
visa
granted
by
the
federal
government
to
employees
of
an
international
organizations.
the
university
of
maryland
drafts
more
favorable
terms
as
to
tuition
and
other
charges
to
students
who
have
what
the
university's
policy
statement
calls
in-state
status.
a
prime
condition
of
that
status
is
that
the
parent
of
the
student
although
living
in
maryland,
must
also
be
domiciled
in
maryland.
and
the
university
denied
respondents
in-state
status
on
the
ground
that
as
the
university
understood
maryland
law,
a
holder
of
an
immigrant
visa
of
the
kind
held
by
his
parents
cannot
acquire
the
intent
requisite
to
domicile,
that
is
intent
to
reside
permanently
in
the
state
of
maryland.
but
there
is
no
controlling
decision
of
a
maryland
court
that
supports
the
university's
view
of
maryland
law,
and
the
university
admitted
at
oral
argument
in
this
court,
that
it
is
entirely
possible
that
the
university
would
accord
these
respondent
students
in-state
status,
if
the
maryland
courts
held
that
they,
the
students
and
their
parents
can,
under
maryland
law,
acquire
a
maryland
domicile.
in
that
circumstance
and
following
our
usual
practice
not
to
decide
federal
constitutional
questions
that
do
not
have
to
be
decided,
we
have
decided
to
avail
ourselves
of
a
provision
of
a
maryland
statute,
that
authorizes
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
maryland's
highest
court,
to
answer
questions
of
maryland
law
certified
to
that
court
by
this
court.
accordingly,
the
following
question
is
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
all
persons
residing
in
maryland
who
hold
or
are
named
in
a
visa
under
8
united
states
code,
section
1101
(a)
or
who
are
financially
dependent
upon
a
person
holding
or
named
in
such
a
visa,
incapable
as
a
matter
of
state
law
of
becoming
domiciliaries
in
maryland.
