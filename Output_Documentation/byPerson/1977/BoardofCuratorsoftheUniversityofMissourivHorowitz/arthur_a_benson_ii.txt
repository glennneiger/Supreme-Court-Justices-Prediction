mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
charlotte
horowitz
in
this
case
was
admitted
to
the
medical
school
as
the
petitioners
have
acknowledged
in
the
fall
of
1971
as
an
advanced
standing
student.
at
that
time
it
is
correct
that
she
was
expected
to
graduate
within
approximately
two
years,
although
the
evidence
in
the
record
appearing
at
pages
87
and
88
of
the
testimony
is
that
that
was
the
bare
minimum
of
time
which
it
would
require
her
to
graduate
because
she
did
not
have
the
extensive
medical
background
that
some
of
her
classmates
admitted
as
advanced
standing
had,
such
as
having
completed
degree
in
oral
surgery,
that
two
years
was
a
bare
minimum
when
she
was
admitted
to
this
medical
school.
at
the
time,
she
was
admitted
to
the
medical
school,
there
were
no
course
requirements
for
graduation.
it
was
not
specified
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
this
in
stipulation
92
that
appears
at
page
25
of
the
appendix
that
there
were
no
particular
number
of
courses
had
to
be
passed
in
order
to
graduate
and
that
there
were
was
no
particular
number
of
courses
which
if
failed
would
result
in
dismissal.
the
parties
have
also
stipulated
that
stipulation
number
29
at
page
12,
that
this
student
passed
every
single
course
by
receiving
a
satisfactory
grade
in
every
course
up
until
may
1,
1973
at
the
time
the
committees
finally
determined
she
would
not
graduate.
in
addition,
the
term
satisfactory
completion
of
the
course
is
defined
by
the
stipulations
of
the
party
at
stipulation
82
on
page
23
has
meaning
that
this
student
had
met
the
standards
of
acceptable
performance
by
students
at
this
school.
so,
at
the
time
she
had
virtually
completed
her
two
years
of
the
medical
school,
she
had
passed
every
single
course
by
receiving
a
satisfactory
grade
and
it
had
been
so
informed.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
just
what
i
was
going
to
address.
she
had
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes.
the
courses
she
took
included
clinical
rotations.
for
instance,
pediatric
was
a
rotation
which
she
took
which
included
clinical
exposure
to
sick
children
as
well
as
to
the
healthy
children
and
she
received
a
satisfactory
grade
for
that
and
was
communicated
to
her.
but,
the
same
time
she
was
completing
that
course
and
during
that
course
some
of
the
faculty
were
adversely
evaluating
her
performance
and
were
documenting
their
beliefs
that
her
performance
was
somewhat
less
than
satisfactory
and
yet
from
the
record
it
is
clear
that
she
never
saw
those
evaluations
until
after
this
litigation
was
commenced
and
they
were
produced
in
discovery.
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
deemed
by
some
of
her
professors.
that
she
had
although
received
a
satisfactory
grade
had
not
satisfactorily
enough
completed
those
courses.
she
did
know
however,
that
she
was
having
some
difficulties
in
clinical
competence.
the
first
that
she
learned
was
the
july
5,
1972
letter
placing
her
on
probation.
that
letter
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
180,
however
reflects
only
a
concern
about
her
relationships
with
other
persons
and
then,
with
regard
to
the
clinical
aspect
of
that
states
that
in
order
to
improve
her
relationships
with
other
person,
she
needs
to
begin
keeping
to
establish
schedules
and
meeting
all
clinical
responsibilities
on
time
and
gracefully.
we
are
still
not
certain
as
to
what
on
meeting
a
clinical
responsibility
gracefully
means.
but,
that
was
the
first
reference
to
some
allegation
that
she
was
somehow
deficient
in
clinical
abilities.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no.
i
am
sure,
many
schools
do.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no,
they
did
not.
it
is
the
party
has
stipulated,
stipulation
number
92,
that
they
did
not.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no,
the
stipulation
i
believe
is
on
page
25
is
that
policies
and
regulations
of
the
medical
school
do
not
state
the
requirements
for
graduation
in
terms
of
the
successful
completion
of
any
number,
that
should
be
over
percentage
of
courses.
nor
do
the
policies
of
the
medical
school
specify
that
students
should
not
be
graduated
for
not
having
successfully
completed
their
course
or
courses.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
that
is
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
an
excellent
question
and
that
this
something
that
this
student
having
gone
through
two
years
of
this
medical
school
having
up
until
may
1st
of
1973
having
received
a
satisfactory
grade
and
the
only
grades
that
you
get
at
this
medical
school
are
satisfactory,
unsatisfactory
or
no
credit,
having
gotten
the
highest
grade
that
she
could
receive.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
i
am--
no
that
is
not
quite
right
because
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
our
allegation
is
that
when
a
professional
graduate
school,
where
the
student
is
in
the
school
with
an
aim
towards
a,
clearly
a
particular
field
and
that
school
slams
the
door
in
the
face
of
that
student's
being
able
to
get
into
that
professional
field
that,
that
is
a
foreclosure
of
--
full
range
of
employment
opportunities
which
this
court
has
in
the
past
in
similar
circumstances
and
should
in
this
case
require
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
i
believe
that,
that
would
be
correct
and
i
do
not
believe
that
is--
should
be
in
a
impediment
to
adopting
such
a
ruling
because
in
goss
v.
lopez,
this
court
has
required
due
process
hearings
for
clearly
disciplinary
reasons.
now,
when
if
the
court
agrees
that
there
is
a
foreclosure
of
a
range
of
professional
or
employment
opportunities.
then
a
due
process
hearing
is
required
but
the
format
of
that
due
process
hearing
can
be
determined
by
the
institution
within
the
guidelines
of
matthews
v.
eldridge
decision
of
this
court
and
in
the
example
that
you
gave,
a
student
who
flunked
some
courses
in
history
in
an
undergraduate
college
might
find
the
due
process
requirements
satisfied
simply
by
a
letter
from
the
dean
indicating
that
the
student
had
failed
courses
a,
b
and
c
and
that
the
student
differed
with
that
finding
that
he
could
appear
in
the
dean's
office
on
friday
at
1:30
and
if
they
would
like
to
see
the
records,
he
could
ask
in
advance
for
them
to
be
produced.
and
he
could
have
a
hearing
with
the
dean.
i
believe
that
would
suffice
and
in
many
educational
institutions
do
that
informally
or
formally
now
throughout
the
nation
and
so
requiring
a
due
process
hearing
before
student
is
expelled
would
not
place
any
substantial
burden
upon
any
of
the
educational
institutions.
in
a
professional
graduate
situation
however,
if
the
due
process
hearing
under
matthews
v.
eldridge
type
of
test
might
be
somewhat
more
involved.
in
this
case,
all
we
are
asking
for
is
a--
some
written
specifications
to
the
student.
who
had
thought
throughout
her
college
career,
her
graduate
career
that
she
was
satisfactorily
completing
the
requirements
of
the
course.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes.
at
the
completion
of
her
first
year,
she
was
placed
on
probation
as
i
indicated,
the
probation
letter
stated
that
her
clinical
deficiencies
had
to
do
with
being
on
time
and
meeting
of
responsibilities
gracefully.
it
was
in
the
later
letter,
she
was
--
it
was
advised
in
the
term
clinical
competence.
i
believe
it
is
the
february
1973
letter,
which
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the
probation
letter
of
july
stated
keeping
to
establish
schedules.
meeting
all
clinical
responsibilities
on
time
and
gracefully
and
that
is
the
only
reference
to
clinical--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
and
it
goes
on
to
say
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes
and
says
attending
gracefully,
the
personal
appearance,
carefully
to
her
personal
appearance
including
hand
washing
and
grooming.
participating
appropriately
in
the
activities
of
the
school
and
directing
criticisms
and
suggestions
materially
to
her
docent.
now,
those
are
types
of,
what
would--
we
maintain
are
clearly
conduct
related
accusations.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes,
it
did.
no
doubt
about
that
and
she
received
additional
notice
in
the
february
7th
letter
which
appears
at
182
of
the
appendix.
when
she
was
told
that
she
would
not
graduate
and
she
was
told
that
the
reasons
were
clinical
competence.
but,
it
is
not
further
specified
or
defined.
care
and
patient
relations.
personal
hygiene
and
ability
to
accept
criticism.
it
appears
that
it
is
a
condensation
of
the
same
four
reasons
that
it
had
been
spelled
in
the
july
5th
letter
probation.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes,
our
primary
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
in
our
brief
we
primarily
address
ourselves
to
the
question
of
the
liberty
interest.
the
foreclosure
of
performing.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
believe
in
this
case
that
primarily
has
been
deprived
of
her
liberty
interest
in
pursuing
her
chosen
career.
a
common
occupation
of
life
in
the
medical
profession.
i
believe
that
has
been
clearly
established
by,
one
the
fact
that
she
had
a
job--the
north
carolina,
medical
school,
department
of
psychiatry
contingent
upon
receiving
the
degree
from
the
school
she
lost
the
job
at
north
carolina,
that
is
a
clear
foreclosure
of
an
employment
opportunity
and
which
is
of
record
and
secondly
dr.
cohen
testified
in
his
expert
and
uncontroverted
testimony
that
the
student
was
virtually
precluded
from
ever
again
obtaining
admission
to
any
other
medical
school
or
for
finding
employment
in
medically
related
field,
a
clear
deprivation
of
her
liberty
interest
in
employment.
now
with
regard
to
the
property
interest
i
believe
that
it
is
secondary
but
nonetheless
important
because
at
the
time
she
entered
school,
she
had,
i
believe
a
reasonable
expectation
of
an
entitlement
to
a
degree
if
she
would
meet
the
requirements
of
the
school.
now
the
school
here
did
not
spell
out
its
requirements
for
graduate
admission.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
it
told
her
that
she
had
not
met
them
and
that
she
would
not
be
graduated.
now
there
is
a
difference
between
not
being
graduated
and
being
dismissed
from
the
school
because
at
the
time
she
was
told
that
she
would
not
be
graduated,
there
was
the
expectation
that
she
would
be
continued
in
school
for
an
additional
length
of
time.
the
school
called
that
deceleration
and
other
students
were
decelerated
and
in
fact
she
was
specifically
told
that
the
committees
would
meet
at
some
later
time
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
would
be
continued
in
school
or
dismissed
and
in
may
of
1973
the
decision
was
made
that
after
this
reviewing
procedure
that
no
new
information
have
been
presented
and
the
school
would
stand
by
its
decision
not
to
graduate
her.
then
at
the
end
of
that
month
a
whole
new
set
of
hearings
were
held
without
knowledge
to
her,
without
an
opportunity
to
attend
in
which
it
was
decided
she
would
be
dismissed
from
the
school
and
so
she
was
placed
on
notice
that
she
would
not
graduate
but
she
was
never
placed
on
notice
that
she
would
be
dismissed
from
the
school.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes
she
did.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the
seven
examining
physicians
reviewed
her,
interviewed
her
and
they
submitted
their
findings.
of
the
seven
two
recommended
that
she
graduate,
two
recommended
that
she
be
dismissed,
two
recommended
that
she
be
continued
on
probation
and
recommendation
of
the
seventh
was
indeterminant.
in
any
event,
there
was
no
clear
majority
of
the
recommendations
from
those
seven
examining
physicians
and
the
medical
school
had
established
a
tallying
procedure
as
to
what
to
do
in
the
event
there
was
no
clear
majority
and
that
required
calling
the
physicians
together
so
that
they
might
discuss
the
evaluations
and
resolve
the
differences
and
yet
this
medical
school
failed
to
do
this,
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
rule
that
was
for
the
advantage
of
the
student
and
i
think
that
is
an
important
failure
on
the
part
of
medical
school
because
it
precluded
the
opportunity
that
these
seven
examining
positions
might
have
come
together
having
discussed
their
differences
and
agreed
that
perhaps
would
be
appropriate
to
continue
her
on
probation
to
allow
her
to
deceleration
option
if
it
was
available
to
them.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
we
might
be
because
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
it
is.
the
process
is
not
really
an
appeal,
although
it
was
called
an
appeal
by
the
medical
school,
it
was
purely
advisory.
it
was
not
to
a
higher
body
within
the
school
but
had
any
ultimate
decision
making
authority
and
in
this
case
it
was,
the
recommendations
from
these
examining
physicians
came
back
to
the
same
committee
that
had
requested
them.
so
it
was
not
an
appeal
and
whether
that
meets
the
procedural
requirements
of
due
process,
i
doubt.
but
in
any
event
that
did
not
happen
here
and
the
recommendations
came
back
without
any
unanimity
much
less
majority
opinion.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
the
statement
of
facts,
we
did
not.
we
discussed
the
question
says
her
admissions,
the
interview
at
that
time,
the
fact
that
she
was
interested
in
academic
psychiatry
at
the
time
she
was
admitted,
that
the
school
was
offering
a
clinical
program--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no
it
is
not.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
a
primary
reliance
is--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
as
approaches
this
case--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
if
it
were
the
same
decision,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
judicial
review
only
on
an
allegation
of
arbitrary
capriciousness.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
the
issue
on
the
trail
court
was
whether
or
not
she
was
entitled
to
due
process
hearing
prior
to
her
dismissal.
the
court
made
findings
that
she
had
been
dismissed
for
reasons
which
were
adequate
but
that
was
not
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
correct
but
that
was--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
one
of
the
advantages
of
a
procedural
due
process
hearing
within
the
educational
institution
is
as
this
court
recognized
in
goss
v.
lopez
is
to
give
the
grieved
student
an
opportunity
to
characterize
his
conduct.
it
would
provide
an
opportunity
to--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes,
but
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
only
whether
she
had
a
legal
entitlement
to
a
pre-dismissal
hearing.
she
did
not
come
to
the
district
court
to
offer
evidence
in
mitigation,
for
instance,
nor
to
characterize
her
conduct
with
regard
to
whether
she
should
be
entitled
to
deceleration
option
or
not.
those
issues
were
not
before
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
in
order
to
hold
the
hearing
or
to
effect
the
dismissal?
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
they
may
make
any
finding
withing
their
discretion
provided
that
it
is
neither
arbitrary
nor
capricious
nor
in
bad
faith.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
believe
that
it
should
be
a
prior
hearing,
prior
to
the
dismissal
to
meet
the
requirements
of
not--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
in
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
in
order
to
avoid
foreclosing
the
range
of
employment
opportunities.
i
believe
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
to
require--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
and
if
the
hearing
were
held
sometime
immediately
following
her
dismissal,
i
suppose
it
would
meet
the
requirements
of
due
process,
provided
it
were
sufficiently
soon
after
her
dismissal
to
avoid
the
foreclosure
of
a
range
of
employment
opportunities.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well,
in
court
would
not
be
satisfactory
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
legally
the
judge,
the
federal
district
court
would
not
have
the
authority
to
weigh
facts
in
litigation
of
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
it
is
the
state
that
is
foreclosing
the
range
of
employment
opportunities
so
it
must
be
the
state
which
affords
the
due
process
hearing--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
if
the
state
wished
to
establish
that
by
statute
that
would
in
my
opinion
meet
the
requirements
of
due
process,
but
that
does
not
happen
here.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no
because
she
can
only
go
to
court
under
the
42
u.s.c.
1983,
seeking
here
and
the
adjudication
that
she
was
entitled
to
due
process
hearing
from
the
state.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
believe
she
could
only
have
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
whether
she
was
not
entitled
to
hearing
from
the
state.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
only
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
agency
which
is
foreclosing
the
employment
opportunities
is
subject
to
the
limited
judicial
review
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
deprivation
of
her
rights.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
substantially
different
and
that
that
is
no
different
than
existing
role
right
now,
any
student
who
believes
that
he
or
she
has
been
arbitrarily
deprived
of
a
property
of
liberty
the
interest
may
go
the
federal
district
court,
but
under
the
due
process
hearing
which
we
believe
is
required
here,
that
judicial
review
would
be
facilitated
because
the
due
process
would
require
a
written
notice
and
it
would
require
some
record
of
due
process
hearing.
that
might
only
be
minutes,
but
that
would
provide
a
record
of
the
due
process
hearing,
a
presumption
of
regularity
would
attach
to
it
and
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
substantial
for
a
student
who
wished
to
go
on
to
court
to
review
that
decision
or
an
allegation
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
i
do
not
believe
the
issues
is
now
before
us
is
to
whether
or
not,
there
is
right
of
council,
for
instance
in
such
a
due
process
hearing.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
believe
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
allow
the
medical
institution
to
in
the
first
instance
establish
its
procedures
that
meet
the
minimal
requirements
of
due
process,
so
that
this
court
is
not
in
the
position
of
dictating
the
format
of
the
due
process
hearing
for
every
graduate
educational
institutions
in
united
state,
some
might
find
that
right
of
counsel
would
not
facilitate
the
due
process
hearing
and
in
others
where
the
issue
are
more
complicated
right
of
counsel
might
be
of
advantage
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
am
not
certain
to
counsel
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
am
on
both
side
if
counsel
were
available
i
am
sure,
that
they
would
be
available
to
both
sides,
but
where
they
are
difficult
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
we
are
not
insisting
our
right
of
counsel
at
this
point,
we
are
simply
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
we
will
be
satisfied
with
an
administrative
hearing
within
the
educational
institution
provided
that
the
rules
were
established
in
advance
and
that
there
was
written
notice
and
that
there
was
some
means
of
record
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the
student
horowitz
was
not
advised
in
writing
of
the
details
of
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
she
had
hundreds
of
oral
conversations
with
her
docent
who
was
the
primary
teaching
and
her
docent
was
repeatedly
telling
her
that
her
clinical
competency
was
sufficient
to
graduate
well
he--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
that
is
what
the
his
testimony
is
in
the
record
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
no
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
arbitrary.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
if
she
did
not
cure
it.
the
adequate
notice
i
was
about
to
mention
was
to
the
the
school
place
has
great
reliance
upon
the
clinical
competence
and
yet
the
allegations
of
her
alleged
deficiencies
in
clinical
competence
were
never
spelled
out
to
her
in
any
means
and
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the
major
weakness
in
this
case
was
that
she
had
no
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
committee
with
knowledge
of
what
---
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yeah
but
they
had
no
authority,
their
judgments
were
covered
the
gamut
of
recommendations
and
it
was
ignored
by
the
medical
school,
but
the
major
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
the
judgments
of
the
medical
school,
a
majority
of
them
at
least
four
recommended
either
that
she
graduate
on
schedule
or
that
she
be
continued
on
probation
four
of
the
seven
recommended
one
of
those
two
options
and
yet
that
recommendation
was
ignored
and
she
was
dismissed
from
the
medical
school,
but
the
major
deficiency
is
that
she
never
had
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
the
coordinating
committee
which
was
the
committee
which
was
making
the
decisions
as
to
whether
or
not
she
should
be
graduated
or
not
and
she
had
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
that
committee
armed
with
the
allegations
against
her
knowledge
of
them,
notice
of
them
and
with
an
opportunity
to
rebut
them.
she
had
no
opportunity
to
argue
before
that
committee,
the
circumstances
that
would
characterize
her
conduct
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
if
she
did
and
if
they
had
authority
to
make
decision
---
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
right,
so
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
so
that
she
could
argue
mitigation,
so
that
she
could
argue
the
characterization
of
her
conduct
in
the
event
that
she
decided
to
do
that
in
instead
of
denying
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
those
recommendations,
as
i
understand
them
are
binding
unless
overturned
by
higher
authority
that
the
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
i
am
certain
that
there
are
cases
but
i
cannot
recall
one
--
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes
and
the
–
i
believe
goss
versus
lopez
states
in
it
that
with
that
is
a
conduct
related
case,
that
the
right
to
due
process
hearing
is
before
some
authority
of
the
school.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
in
this
case
it
is,
but
for
two
reasons
because
the
majority
opinion
of
the
recommendation
of
the
those
seven
examining
physicians
was
ignored
and
because
the
procedure
of
the
school
in
establishing
that
process
of
examination
was
also
ignored
and
that
the
seven
examining
physicians
were
not
called
up
together
to
discuss
their
opinion
and
to
resolve
differences
so,
in
that
respect
she
was
denied
procedural
due
process
because
the
school
failed
to
follow
its
own
rules.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
that
is
right
and
we
discuss
that
more
fully
in
the
brief
but
the
primary
importance
of
the
due
process
hearing
here
is
for
horowitz
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
come
forward
and
said
i
only
had
two
years
at
this
medical
school,
i
may
have
some
clinical
deficiencies.
it
was
excepted
that
i
might
require
more,
i
have
to
see
that
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
yes.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
it
is
a
warning
but
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
graduate
her
was
not
be
considered
until
may
of
1973
that
it
was
decided
at
that
time
to
initiate
a
series
of
committee
meetings
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
arthur
a.
benson,
ii
well
i
think
she
knew
all
along
any
student
knows
all
along
that
you
can
be
dismissed
for
something
that
the
schools
have
the
authority
to
dismiss
its
student
at
some
point
for
some
time,
but
she
never
received
a
formal
notice
from
the
school
that
she
had
because
of
certain
deficiencies
which
were
spelled
out
in
the
notice,
a
committees
would
be
meeting
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
should
be
dismissed
and
that
she
have
an
opportunities
to
appear
in
that
meeting
and
rebut
the
allegations.
thank
you.
