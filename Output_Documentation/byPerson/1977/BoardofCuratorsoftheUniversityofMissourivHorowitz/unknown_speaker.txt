unknown
speaker
is
that
a
four
year
school?
unknown
speaker
in
that
school.
unknown
speaker
there
are
repeated
references
in
the
briefs
to
this
criterion
of
being
a
safe
physician
that
was
kind
of
a
new
term
to
me
in
this
context
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
does
the
university
run
any
other
medical
schools?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
post
graduate
school.
unknown
speaker
would
i
be
correct
in
the
inference
that
i
drew
from
the
briefs,
that
the
emphasis
of
this
medical
school
is
on
producing,
practicing
clinical
physicians
rather
than
the
people
who
are
going
devote
their
carriers
to
medical
research.
so
--
unknown
speaker
now
what
does
clinical
competency
mean?
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
result
of
written
or
even
oral
examinations
but
as
a
result
of
observation
of
her
conduct
in
that
setting
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
at
what
level
had
ms.
horowitz
entered
this
school,
you
said
this
was
a
post
high
school,
six
year
school
for
people
who
progressed
form
high
school.
but
she
already
been
to
college
and
to
graduate
school
so
tell
me
what
did
she
come
here
recruited
here
in
the
fifth
year.
unknown
speaker
so
she
would
have
if
all
had
and
gone
well,
she
would
have
been
there
for
two
year
before
graduating.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wright
i
am
little
concerned
--
interested
rather
why
was
she
admitted
to
the
school
at
all?
in
view
of
the
type
of
emphasis
they
have
on
their
education
here
was
somebody
with
a
college
educations,
and
medical
experience.
and
they
bring
her
in
at
an
advanced
standing,
do
they
bring
many
in
this
way
or
--
unknown
speaker
just
because
the
school
was
new
and
they
needed
to
fill
up
because
it
is
hard
to
get
into
other
medical
schools
we
have
been
told?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
where
she
had
had
medical
school
experience
before
and
why
she
did
not
stay
there?
unknown
speaker
sorry
to
ask
you
so
many
questions.
unknown
speaker
approximately
how
many
student
in
each
class
unknown
speaker
at
your
school
at
--your
client's
school.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
record
show
how
many
do
not
involuntarily
leave?
unknown
speaker
so
as
far
as
the
record
show
ms.
horowitz
might
have
been
the
only
one
or
she
might
have
been
one
of
a
dozen.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
we
do
not
know
if
she
is
the
only
one
or
were
there
others
and
--
unknown
speaker
her
year
,were
there
any
others.
form
her
class
were
there
any
others?
unknown
speaker
you
said
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
except
for
this
case,
the
status
of
the
law
has
changed?
unknown
speaker
did
dr.
cohen
attribute
that
to
some
fixed
rule
or
just
his
subjective
judgment?\
unknown
speaker
mr.
wright,
you
stated
that
there
is
no
right
in
the
missouri
to
a
medical
education,
i
think
we
could
accept
that
certainly,
assuming
for
the
moment,
is
the
situation
changed
after
the
medical
school
accepts
an
individual
for
admission
to
the
medical
school
at
least
there
is
some
expectation
of
graduating
is
not
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact,
that
sometimes
present
a
question
that
whether
not
student
is
so
treated?
unknown
speaker
mr
wright,
if
she
had
graduated
would
she
automatically
be
eligible
to
practice
medicine
or
would
she
have
had
to
take
a
further
examination
some
time,
something
in
the
records
suggests
graduation
qualifies
a
person
to
practice.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
that
letter
was
a
little
more
detailed
on
timeliness
and
grace.
unknown
speaker
that
it
goes
on
--
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
need
to,
but
it
certainly
says
more
than
those
two
things.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benson,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
comes
into
play
if
and
only
if
there
is
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property.
now
clearly
here
there
was
not
a
deprivation
of
life.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
so
far
from
your
oral
argument,
whether
your
claim
is
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
or
property.
i
had
understood
your
brief
to
say
only
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
apply
that
as
i
understood
that
there
are
some
sort
of
upon
acceptance
to
this
educational
institution.
there
was
a
vested
right
to
graduate
and
if
so
that
would
be
a
claim
that
there
was
a
property,
right?
unknown
speaker
a
equivalent
of
more
or
less
analogous
to
a
tenure
for
a
faculty
member
rather
than
--
but,
i
did
not
understand
that
claim
to
be
made
at
all
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
we
missed
at
one
of
those
three
deprivations
that
due
process
clause
is
not
implicated
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
tell
her
that
she
have
not
met
them?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
relying
on
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well
then
yes
or
no?
are
you
relying
on
the
property
interest
?
unknown
speaker
the
case
really
is
a
procedural
due
process
case,
i
take
?
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
had
what
you
thought
was
full
procedural
due
process,
would
you
think
the
decision
to
expel
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
i
take
it
that
there
was
a
full
trial
in
the
district
court
on
whether
or
not
that
she
was
properly
expelled
within
the
rules
of
university?
unknown
speaker
and
full
compliance
with
the
university
rules
had
been
had?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
hearing
that
she
had
in
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
her
dismissal
does
not
satisfy
any
procedural
due
process
requirement?
unknown
speaker
she
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
characterize
her
conduct
here
in
the
district
court,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
way,
suppose
you
won
here
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
--
what
standard
would
the
court
require
the
university
to
impose
as
a
pre-eviction
ruling?
its
probable
cause
to
believe
or
they
have
to
make
some
final
--?
unknown
speaker
to
effect
the
dismissal.
unknown
speaker
prior
to,
what
standard
do
they
apply
and
what
kind
of
finding
must
they
make
prior
to
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
what
if
they
say,
there
is
probable
cause
for
us
to
believe
that
you
do
not
measure
up
and
so
you
are
being
dismissed
but
there
will
be
a
full
hearing
available
to
you
later?
well,
we
then
must
make
a
final
judgment.
unknown
speaker
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
unknown
speaker
what
administrative
hearing
must
make
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
what
if
she
was
dismissed
and
then
she
had
an
opportunity
for
a
full
hearing
and
she
won
it?
unknown
speaker
well
what
if
there
was
an
administrative
hearing
in
which
they
listened
to
her
side
of
the
story
but
they
made
some,
they
concluded
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
dismiss
and
then
told
her
if
you
like
a
full
hearing
we
will
see
it
in
court?
unknown
speaker
what
case
do
you
rely
on
that
the
final
due
process
hearing,
that
makes
the
final
judgment
must
be
administrative
rather
than
judicial?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they
have
a
court
system
and
say
we
just
want
to
make
sure
we
have
a
disinterested
judge,
we
do
not
want
to
be
accused
of
that
and
we
do
not
want
to
be
accused
of
having
inadequate
procedure,
no
cross-examination.
so
we
will
have
the
full
we
will
give
you
the
full
treatment
in
court
and
if
you
object
to
the
burden
of
proof,
we
will
assume
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
already
established
by
statute
in
the
sense
of
that
she
can
go
to
court
and
sue
the
university.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
could
not
she
go
into
a
state
court
and
have
the
kind
of
hearing
she
wanted.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
i
thought
you
said
it
was
subject
to
the
judicial
review
the
judgment
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
principle
procedural
defect
that
you
complain
of?
there
is
something
entitled
to
due
process
but
what
is
the
principle
defect
in
the
proceedings
given
your
client
by
the
university?
unknown
speaker
the
constitution
required
be
in
writing
rather
than
oral
was
she
advised
orally
there
is
lot
of
testimony
and
some
findings
about,
there
are
hundreds
of
oral
conversations.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
found.
unknown
speaker
he,
for
example
testified
that
on
hundreds
of
occasion,
over
hundred
occasions
he
told
her
that
her
appearance
was
unsatisfactory
and
then
repeatedly
she
was
advised
she
had
to
have
a
white
clean
white
coat,
now
i
do
not
know
how
important
that
is,
but
suppose
if
she
did
not
have
a
clean
white
coat
and
never
gotten
one,
would
it
be
arbitrary
for
them
to
say
you
cannot
graduate
if
you
cannot
form
a
habit
of
wearing
a
clean
white
coat
and
interview
patients.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
she
not
advised
that
that
was
one
requirement
she
had
to
cure?
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
did
not
she
have
adequate
notice?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
insist,
the
principle,
i
want
to
know
what
the
the
major
weakness
is
--
is
it
that,
it
was
oral
rather
than
writing
or
none
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
she
appeared
before
seven
separate
doctors--
unknown
speaker
what
was
ignored
by
the
medical
school?
unknown
speaker
this
argument
would
be
equally
strong
and
even
if
she
had
such
opportunity
before
each
of
the
seven
doctors
who
did
interview
her
in
person.
unknown
speaker
make
a
decision,
they
could
only
recommend
that
is
not
enough
to
appear
before
recommending
group,
she
must
appear
before
the
final
decision
maker.
unknown
speaker
so
what
sort
of
shows
this?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
of
bar
review
procedures
where
the
lawyer
who
is
subject
to
discipline
appears
before
a
committee
that
then
makes
a
recommendation
either
to
the
court
or
to
the
some
other
body
before
when
he
does
not
specifically
appear
and
yet
generally
has
been
thought
alright.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
case
that
holds
that
there
is
right
to
appear
before
the
decision
maker
as
opposed
to
before
a
body
making
recommendations
to
the
decision
maker.
unknown
speaker
this
is
your
critical
argument,
you
have
no
case
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
constitutionally
deficient
to
have
seven
doctors
interview
a
person
considered
for
graduation
at
a
length,
discuss
the
whole
problem,
then
the
seven
make
written
recommendations
to
the
president
of
the
university.
the
president
of
the
university
can
not
decide
whether
dismiss
without
interviewing
the
student
himself.
that
is
your
position
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
different
that
critical
defect,
failure
to
follow
to
its
own
rules.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
because
i
may
have
missed
that,
you
emphasized
the
distinction
between
failure
to
graduate
and
being
dismissed.
you
said
she
had
notice
of
the
former
but
not
the
later.
unknown
speaker
but
the
letter
of
february
7,
19773
from
dean
norbeck
access
–
you
have
to
make
improvement
or
you
will
not
be
able
to
continue
in
the
medical
school
after
may
of
this
year.
isn't
that
notice
of
possible
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
but
is
this
not
notice
that
she
might
be
--
she
was
subject
to
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
wright,
i
think
your
position
is
that
the
total
process
to
which
she
was
(inaudible),
the
university
gave
her.
that
was
the
end
of
line,
she
never
was
going
to
have
another
hearing
inside
the
university
or
out.
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
the
state
court
you
could
she
have
got
review
of
the
university's
decision
to
expel
her?
unknown
speaker
or
you
think
is
there
some
established
statutory
proceeding
--
unknown
speaker
well
what
was
she
has
done
--
if
she
had
gone
to
state
court
and
wanted
to
--
a
full
blown
trial
on
her
expulsion
could
she
have
obtained
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
answer
is
that
under
the
missouri
law
that
she
has
already
at
the
end
of
the
line
when
the
university
made
its
own
decision
she
could
not
get
it
reviewed
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
well
or
on
any
other
basis,
she
could
get
no
review
in
the
state
courts
of
that
decision
to
be
expel.
unknown
speaker
was
there
an
established
procedure
for
doing
that
under
the
missouri
statutes?
unknown
speaker
well
my
question
is
mr.
wright
is
what
about
state
law?
unknown
speaker
no
mr.
wright
i
gather
that
some
review
administrative
agency
determination
in
missouri
courts
is
that
not?
unknown
speaker
would
this
fit
with
any
those
procedures
whatever
they
may
be?
