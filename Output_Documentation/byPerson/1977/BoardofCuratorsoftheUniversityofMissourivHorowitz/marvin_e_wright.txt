mr.
marvin
e.
wright
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
marvin
wright,
attorney
representing
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
are
the
university
of
missouri,
the
governing
board
of
that
institution,
provost
for
health
sciences
on
the
campus
of
the
university
located
in
kansas
city
and
the
dean
of
the
school
of
medicine
located
on
the
campus
of
university
of
missouri
at
kansas
city.
respondent
is
miss.
charlotte
horowitz
who
was
a
student
in
that
medical
school,
until
her
dismissal
for
deficient
academic
performance
in
1973.
now,
the
issue,
primary
issue
before
the
court
today
is
that
of
whether
or
not
a
medical
student
in
a
public
institution
of
higher
education
is
entitled
to
a
notice
of
charges
and
a
hearing
prior
to
dismissal
from
that
school
for
deficient
academic
performance,
its
second
issue
is
that
of
whether
or
not,
when
a
medical
student
has
prior
knowledge
of
deficient
academic
performance,
the
reasons
are
not
disclosed
and
made
public,
whether
or
not
that
student
has
a
stigma
imposed
upon
them.
under
the
preview
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
when
a
formal
hearing
is
not
held.
the
last
issue
naturally
is
that
of
whether
or
not
the
procedures
which
were
utilized
by
the
university
of
missouri
were
fair
to
the
student
and
complied
with
any
requirements
of
the
procedural
due
process.
now
the
facts
just
very
briefly
of
the
case
are
this.
the
school
was
established
in
1971,
the
governing
board
adopted
a
document
entitled
an
academic
plan.
now
for
purposes
of
the
case
today,
this
academic
plan
established
or
is
called
a
council
on
evaluation,
which
is
a
committee
charged
with
responsibility
of
reviewing
the
academic
performance
of
students
and
then
making
appropriate
recommendations.
there
is
a
second
committee
which
is
referred
to
as
a
coordinating
committee.
responsibility
of
this
committee,
is
to
review
recommendations
coming
out
of
the
first
mentioned
committee.
this
latter
committee
makes
recommendations
to
the
dean
of
the
school
and
the
dean
makes
final
decisions
with
respect
to
student
dismissals.
now,
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
institution
is
set
forth
in
this
academic
plan,
do
not
extend
to
the
student,
the
right
to
appear
before
either
of
these
committees
or
the
dean,
when
the
question
is
that
of
an
evaluation
of
academic
performance.
the
same
documents
sets
forth
the
fact
that
graduating
requirements
of
the
institution
and
the
primary
goal
naturally
is
that
of
graduating
confident
and
safe
physicians,
those
that
are
qualified
not
only
in
basic
medical
science
knowledge,
but
also
qualified
in
the
sense
of
clinical
competency.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor,
i
did
not
believe
that
it
would,
any
more
than
in
the
case
at
bar
because
it
boils
to
a
question
of
the
academic
evaluation
being
placed
upon
the
professors
of
the
institution.
it
is
for
this
reason
the
professors
have
given
the
evaluation
of
60
in
your
example,
the
school
has
set
forth
requirement
of
an
average
as
seventy.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor
because
the
subjective
evaluation
of
the
professors,
the
institution
university
of
missouri
of
kansas
city,
a
numerical
figure
is
not
placed
upon
a
student's
performance,
but
obviously
in
placing
a
sixty
on
the
student
performance,
the
subjective
judgment
of
the
professor
is
what
leads
to
that
conclusion.
now
the
respondent
in
this
case
charlotte
horowitz,
the
university
has
never
raised
any
question
concerning
this
individual's
intellectual
ability.
she
came
to
the
institution
with
fine
academic
credentials,
having
graduated
from
barnard
college
in
chemistry,
columbia
university
with
the
masters
in
psychology.
she
had
one
year
in
phd
program
in
a
pharmacology
at
duke
which
was
the
same
as
the
first
year
medical
student
curriculum.
she
attended
the
womens'
medical
college
of
pennsylvania
and
for
some
four-five
years,
prior
to
admission
in
university
of
missouri
worked
at
the
national
institute
of
hill.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
sir
the
university
of
missouri
kansas
city
medical
school
is
a
six
year
institution,
by
six
years
i
mean
a
student
enter
straight
out
of
high
school
for
a
six
year
curriculum.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
sir.
eleven
months
a
year,
first
two
years
primarily
based
with
under
graduate
work,
the
last
four
years
primarily
concerned
with
what
is
considered
a
typical
type
medical
school
arrangement.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
safe
physician
as
here
was
described
in
testimony
at
the
trial
court,
is
that
the
student
has
sufficient
medical
knowledge,
basic
science
knowledge
and
the
student
has
the
ability
to
function
in
a
clinical
setting
with
patients,
so
as
to
render
primary
care
to
the
general
public.
now
it
has
been
explained
that,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
student
is
all
knowledgeable
and
every
conceivable
medical
question
that
would
come
up,
but
to
be
a
safe
physician,
the
student
would
have
to
have
sufficient
knowledge
to
know
that
was
going
to
be
necessary
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
other
physicians
or
health
care
professionals.
so,
the
global
institution
and
that
of
being
a
safe
physician
is
that
they
can
render
care
to
the
general
public.
now,
primary
medical
care,
not
advanced
specialized
type
care,
because
naturally
that
comes
from
internships
in
residencies
after
they
would
graduate
from
a
medical
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
the
university
operates
a
medical
school
on
the
campus
in
columbia
missouri.
that
medical
school
is
what
people
have
referred
to
as
the
traditional
medical
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor.
this
is
a
school
where
to
be
admitted
to
that
school,
you
must
have
an
under
graduate
degree
and
then
you
go
into
four
years
of
medical
school.
now
the
school
at
university
of
missouri
kansas
city
is
a
school,
which
is
referred
to
as
a
docent
type
institution,
whereby
they
have
shortened
the
years
over
all,
but
they
require
going
to
school
eleven
months
out
of
the
year.
now
a
docent
is
a
physician,
a
professor
who
is
assigned
the
primary
responsibility
of
guiding
the
student
throughout
their
entire
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
that
is
true
your
honor,
the
school
has
very
readily
stated
from
the
very
beginning,
it
is
the
reason
that
the
school
was
established
was
the
responsibility
to
provide
doctors
to
render
primary
care
and
the
school
encourages
students
and
notifies
them
to
that
fact
when
they
are
interviewed
for
admission
to
the
school.
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
at
the
time
of
application
to
this
school
and
interview,
was
so
advised
that
the
school
requires
not
only
basic
medical
science
knowledge,
but
a
clinical
competency,
that
all
students
were
going
to
be
judged
on
the
same
basis,
as
far
as
meeting
any
requirements
for
graduation.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
clinical
competency,
your
honor
is
the
ability
for
doctor
to
function
in
a
patient
setting.
it
is
the
ability
to
take
the
basic
medical
science
knowledge
which
one
learns
from
books
and
to
apply
that
to
a
given
patient,
to
a
given
situation.
it
involves
all
the
way
from
acquiring
a
total
and
complete
medical
history
from
the
patient
to
the
proper
type
of
examinations,
the
proper
type
of
testing
and
then
the
ability
to
relate
the
basic
medical
knowledge
into
a
diagnosis
and
a
formulation
plan
whereby
that
patient
can
be
treated.
and
this
is
unfortunately
the
position
where
the
institution
found
that
the
responded
in
this
case
was
not
deemed
to
be
qualified.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
this
is
true.
now
the
individual
scored
high
on
all
written
examination,
the
didactic
part
of
the
work.
now
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
docent
and
is
pointed
by
trial
judge
after
the
trial.
it
is
unfortunate
but
the
individual
apparently
assume
that
she
could
become
a
doctor
by
reading
a
book,
and
not
treating
patients
and
getting
the
necessary
experience
there.
the
clinical
competency
of
that
evaluation
was
naturally
on
subjective
judgment
of
the
professors
that
she
was
under
and
that
viewed
her
performance
in
a
clinical
setting.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
i
would
excuse
me
–
just
saying
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
institution
after
she
has
been
on
probation
for
a
period
of
roughly
seven
or
eight
months,
the
committees,
the
two
committees
and
the
dean
notified
her
that
she
would
not
be
candidate
to
graduate
in
may
of
1973.
some
five
months
later,
and
an
appeal
was
taken
by
the
student
and
the
institution
setup
a
panel
of
seven
doctors
none
of
which
had
a
appreciable
contact
with
the
student.
so
as
to
get
the
opinion
of
others
just
rather
than
the
faculty
itself
of
the
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
none
of
them
were
instructors
that
instructed
her
in
medical
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor
i
can
not
say
that
they
did
not
have
any
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
i
have
i
did
not
have
the
answer
to
that.
they
may
have
seen
her
at
some
time
in
a
clinic
but
they
were
–
none
of
them
were
docents
of
the
school
non
of
them
were
classified
as
sub-docents
in
a
hospital.
it
is
just
they
may
have
bumped
in
to
the
student
at
some
time
making
clinical
rounds
in
a
hospital.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
how
were
they
picked?
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
they
were
selected
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no,
your
honor
they
were
not.
they
were
picked
because
each
of
these
individual
had
prior
experience
as
professor
in
a
medical
school.
they
were
individuals
that
the
dean
knew
had
outstanding
medical
reputations
and
since
they
had
had
prior
experience
with
medical
education,
felt
that
they
would
be
appropriate
people
to
actually
carry
out
a
practical
and
oral
examination.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor,
they
were
picked
by
the
dean.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
the
instructions
were
by
a
way
of
a
conference
which
the
dean
held
with
each
of
these
physicians,
also
on
march
15th
letter
which
is
in
the
appendix
the
written
instructions
were
given
that--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
the
seven
individuals
each
they
did
not
meet
as
a
composite
group,
each
one
of
them
took
the
student
through
and
oral
and
practical
examination
functioning
with
one
or
more
patients.
now
the
result
was
is
that
one
out
of
the
seven
said
she
was
competent
and
qualified
to
graduate.
that
individual
examined
the
student
in
pathology
which
was
strictly
a
laboratory
setting
with
no
patients
involved.
one
doctor
in
general
medicine
recommended
that
she
be
graduated,
though
he
said
she
was
not
–
would
not
be
acceptable
as
an
intern
in
his
hospital.
the
other
five
physicians
each
independent
of
one
another
came
in
with
recommendations
to
either
drop
the
student
immediately
from
medical
school
or
saying
she
was
not
qualified
to
graduate.
now,
each
of
these
examinations
has
been
described
and
it
was
so
described
in
the
trial
court
has
being
the
equivalent
of
what
the
american
medical
association
has
for
special
board
certification
where
an
individual
would
spend
three
to
four
hours
with
a
given
medical
doctor
in
a
clinical
setting.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
it
is.
i
was
only
pointing
that
out
standpoint
of
view
of
the
time
element
which
is
involved
and
the
seriousness
which
the
institution
had.
following
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
the
equivalent
of
the
fifth
year.
and
the
reason
being.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
she
was
admitted
as
a
advanced
standing
student
because
of
her
previous
educational
background
and
training.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well
your
honor,
the
first
time
that
a
question
arose
with
respect
to
clinical
competency
was
the
first
rotation
really
she
was
on
where
a
clinic
was
involved
was
in
march
of
'72
which
is
some
seven
months
after
she
started
attending
the
institution.
and
they
were
having
difficulty
with
respect
to
the
clinical
performance.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yeah,
they
brought
thirteen
students
into
the
advanced
standing.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
the
school
was
new
your
honor
i
do
not
feel
that
it
was
compulsion
to
fill
the
institution
at
all.
the
reason
as
i
previously
stated
at
the
time
of
interviews
with
the
student,
the
student
was
advised
as
to
the
primary
goals
of
the
institution.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor,
she
had
one
year
in
a
phd.
program
in
pharmacology
at
duke
university.
now
the
significance
of
that
is
the
fact
that
the
phd.
program
there,
the
first
year
is
the
same
curriculum
as
first
year
medical
students
have
at
duke
university.
she
next
attended
the
womens
medical
college
in
pennsylvania
and
after
a
few
months
withdrew
in
good
standing
because
of
ill
health.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
that
is
alright.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well
your
honor
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
the
school,
you
mean
at
university
of
missouri,
kansas
city
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
figures.
i
believe
that
the
institution
is
running
approximately
75
to
100
students
per
class.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no,
your
honor
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
pertaining--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
that
is
true
your
honor.
i
know
there
have
been
other
students
which
have
been
dismissed
for
academic
deficiency
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well
your
honor
she
was
not
and
she
has
not
been
the
only
one
that
has
been
dismissed
from
the
institution
for
academic
deficiencies.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
she
was
the
only
one
that
was
dismissed
at
that
time.
in
this
case,
at
the
time
that
the
respondent
was
dismissed
from
the
medical
school,
the
status
of
the
law
so
to
speak
in
the
country
was
that
it
was
necessary
for
a
student
who
was
being
dismissed
for
academic
deficiency
to
receive
a
notice
of
charges
and
a
hearing.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
feel
that
it
has.
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
i
respectfully
submit
this
that
the
court
is
mistaken
in
the
interpretation
which
they
not
only
placed
upon
an
earlier
decision
of
their's
and
upon
misinterpretation
of
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i
would
speak
primarily
to
the
fact
that
the
first
case
that
of
connelly
versus
university
of
vermont
medical
student
case
where
the
court
set
forth
the
reasoning
for
there
being
no
necessity
for
notice
of
charges
in
the
hearing.
and
there
were
several
other
cases
including
the
fifth
circuit
which
had
held
that
that
was
true.
now,
the
eight
circuit
had
handed
down
a
greenhill
decision
as
greenhill
v.
bailey
that
of
the
medical
school
university
of
iowa.
in
that
case,
the
eight
circuit
specifically
held
that
the
student
was
entitled
to
a
notice
of
charges
and
a
hearing
but
what
they
said
in
that
case
was
because
the
school
had
stated
that
the
student
did
not
have
the
intellectual
ability
to
be
a
doctor
and
further
they
communicated
that
to
the
association
of
american
medical
colleges.
now,
they
italicized
in
their
opinion
the
fact
that
they
were
not
sending
this
back
for
any
hearing
on
performance
of
the
student
or
an
academic
evaluation.
so,
i
would
submit
that
the
case
did
not
stand
for
what
the
eight
circuit
majority
indicated
that
it
did.
now
there
was
a
dissent.
we
requested,
a
rehearing
a
transfer
court
in
bank
the
chief
justice
of
the
eight
circuit
wrote
a
dissent
joined
by
two
other
judges
pointing
out
that
they
had
misinterpreted
greenhill
and
one
of
the
other
judges
that
joined
in
the
dissent
actually
wrote
the
opinion
in
greenhill.
now,
the
eight
circuit
also
relied
upon
the
roth
decision
of
this
court
in
1972,
now,
roth
involved
a
nontenured
professor
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
court
in
that
case
did
not
find
a
deprivation
of
liberty
interest
nor
did
find
a
deprivation
of
property
interest.
the
court
looked
to
the
law
of
wisconsin,
looked
to
rules
and
regulations
of
the
institution
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
property
interest
and
found
none
to
exist.
now,
i
would
submit
that
in
the
case
we
have
before
the
court
today,
that
a
student
in
higher
education
in
the
state
of
missouri
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
medical
education.
there
are
no
statutes
in
the
state
of
missouri
extending
such
right.
secondly
the
university
of
missouri
the
rules
and
regulations
of
that
university
do
not
extend
such
a
right.
with
respect
to
the
liberty
interest,
it
was
covered
in
roth,
the
court
looked
to
the
good
name
reputation,
honor
and
integrity
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
adversely
affected
by
what
the
government
was
doing
to
the
given
individual.
as
i
previously
stated,
the
court
found
in
that
case
that
there
was
not
a
stigma,
there
was
not
a
liberty
interest
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
showing
that
there
was
a
charge
or
allegation
of
dishonesty,
immorality
or
that
the
charge
is
going
to
seriously
damage
the
standing
of
the
individual
in
the
community.
now,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
certainly
the
situation
in
the
case
that
we
are
considering
today
because
the
university
at
no
point
in
time
has
ever
challenged
the
honesty,
the
morality,
the
integrity
or
the
intellectual
ability
of
this
student.
i
would
further
submit
that
the
liberty
interest,
the
medical
student
and
the
university
of
missouri
is
not
any
greater
than
the
liberty
interest
of
a
non
tenured
professor.
now
in
the
roth
decision
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
individual
might
be
some
what
less
attractive
for
other
employment
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
of
what
the
individual
would
be
some
what
less
attractive
but
the
individual
was
not
foreclosed
from
seeking
other
employment,
even
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
i
would
submit
that
in
the
case
that
which
we
have,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
of
what
the
student
would
be
somewhat
less
attracted
to
other
medical
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
rule.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
not
to
my
knowledge
no
sir
it
is
not.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
i
do
not
–
i
cannot
answer
clearly
100%
guarantee
but
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
ruling
of
the
association.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
there
was
evidence
there
was
one
professor
not
professor
pardon
me
one
of
the
seven
examining
physicians
dr.
cohen
stated
that
he
felt
that
a
dismissal
for
academic
deficiency
would
affect
the
ability
of
the
student
to
get
into
other
medical
schools
and
to
obtain
employment
in
other
areas,
health
related
areas.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
not
any
question
about
what
they
are
going
to
be
some
what
less
attractive
but
it
does
not
foreclose.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
his
subjective
judgment
and
he
readily
admitted
that
medical
experts
can
disagree
as
far
as
the
performance
of
given
individual
or
given
student.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well
it
had
provisional
accreditation
when
it
opened
its
doors
in
1971.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
it
received
approval
approximately
i
believe
six
or
seven
months
ago.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
what
rule
is
that
your
honor
i
am
sorry.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well,
your
honor
the
situation
is,
is
in
the
performance
or
the
evaluation
in
the
final
action
as
far
as
dismissal
of
the
student
the
deans
very
rightly
pointed
out
the
coordinating
community
which
is
in
the
record
of
the
fact
that
this
student
was
free
to
apply
for
readmission
to
the
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
i
did
not
feel
that
the
situation
changes,
undoubtedly
the
student
is
closer
to
becoming
a
medical
doctor
but
the
admission
to
the
school
means
that
the
student
is
entitled
to
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
other
students
in
that
institution.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor,
that
question
arose
in
this
case.
the
allegations
were
very
specific
in
this
area
and
the
finding
was
specifically
that
there
was
disparate
treatment
between
students
in
the
institutions.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
you
must
graduate
from
a
credited
medical
school
in
state
of
missouri
before
you
are
even
eligible
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
for
admission
to
the
practicing
medicine.
the
students
take
examinations
while
they
are
in
school
and
then
also
after
school
in
order
to
qualify
for
practicing
medicine
in
missouri.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to,
to
merely
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
did
not
come
as
a
bolt
of
lighting
from
the
sky
to
the
student,
when
the
student
was
notified
of
dismissal
from
the
institution.
it
started
with
in
march
of
1972,
with
the
clinical
competency
problem
and
pediatrics
of
which
she
was
advised
of
the
problem
by
her
docent.
we
then
get
to
the
point
where
in
july
of
72,
when
she
is
placed
on
probation
by
the
institution
after
the
committees
had
considered
it.
the
dean,
the
chairman
and
the
counsel
on
evaluation
and
her
docent
sat
down
and
discussed
with
her
all
the
problems
that
she
was
having.
she
received
a
written
notification
setting
forth
the
same
factors.
again
in
october
1972,
three
months
later
her
docent
was
concerned
about
her
performance.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no,
your
honor
obviously,
she
was
having
hearing
outside
because
that
is
why
we
are
here
today
but
might
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
i
think
that
she
could
have.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no,
no
your
honor
i
am
sorry
there
is
not--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
courts
in
missouri
at
least
to
my
knowledge
will
not
get
into
the
subject
before
evaluation.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor
not
as
far
as
these
subjective
evaluation
of
grading
is
concerned.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
yes
i
believe
she
could
have,
well,
from
the
stand
point
of
view
of
whether
or
not
the
decision
was
arbitrary
or
capricious,
without
that
is
in
fact
the
same
as
it
is
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
no
your
honor
there
is
not
a
–
that
a
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well
your
honor
i
am
sorry.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
well,
i
believe
they
could,
form
the
stands
point
of
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
oh,
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
and
it
well
i
was
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
state
law
your
honor
does
not
require
the
university
to
have
a
notice
of
charges
and
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
oh
yes
most
of
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
i
believe
that
it,
because
there
are
specific
statutory
provisions
whereby
one
can
appeal
out
of
an
administrative
hearing.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
i
believe
your
honor
it
would
be
review
on
the
record.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
most
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
wright
thank
you
very
much.
