that
is
one
of
the
elements
in
the
medical
education.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benson,
you
say
that
the
graduation
for
kicking
somebody
out
in
effect
of
a
professional
graduate
school,
forecloses
employment
opportunities
but
surely
that
forecloses
fewer
professional
opportunities
than
being
flunked
out
of
college,
being
flunked
out
of
college
forecloses
fewer
that
have
been
flunked
out
of
high
school,
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
question,
your
proposition,
we
would
be
left
with
a
proposition
that
there
is
a
due
process
hearing
for
â€“
a
flunking
anyone
out
of
any
public
educational
institute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
probation,
only
six
months
after
she
entered
the
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
benson
in
response
to
my
brother
stewart's
question
you
said
that
your
brief
discussed
primarily
the
liberty
interest
but
suggested
also
discussed
property
interest.
do
you
remember
off
hand
where
in
your
brief
you
discussed
property
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
any
part
of
the
legal
portion
of
your
brief
is
devoted
to
a
discussion--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
the
petitioner,
the
university
of
missouri
dismissed
respondent,
charlotte
horowitz
from
its
medical
school
because
of
academic
deficiencies.
the
decision
to
dismissal
was
made
by
the
medical
school's
council
of
evaluation
after
examining
for
academic
performance
over
a
two
year
period
including
one
year
of
probation.
she
sued
petitioners
alleging
that
the
university
had
deprived
her
of
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
by
dismissing
her.
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
after
a
full
trial
concluded
that
she
had
been
afforded
all
rights
guaranteed
her
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
to
what
she
appealed
disagreed
holding
that
she
had
been
denied
procedural
due
process.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
that
the
respondent
had
a
liberty
of
property
interest
and
receded
the
medical
school.
we
concluded
that
the
university
gave
her
adequate
procedural
due
process,
before
the
dismissing.
academic
dismissals
do
not
necessitate
the
same
sort
of
procedures
as
due
disciplinary
dismissals.
we
also
conclude
that
she
was
not
been
deprived
of
substantive
due
process.
even
assuming
that
federal
courts
can
review
under
narrow
standards
of
the
validity
of
an
academic
decision
by
a
public
educational
institution.
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
respondent's
dismissal
was
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.

justice

opinion
of
the
court.

has
also
