justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
state
common
law
in
louisiana?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wegmann,
getting
back
to
the
other
one,
had
there
been
familial
descendants,
the
louisiana
statute
would
not
have
been
inhospitable,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
are
saying
the
statute
is
inhospitable
because
of
the
facts
of
a
particular
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
did
not
prevent
him
from
getting
married
and
did
not
prevent
him
from
leaving
the
heirs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
statute
is
inhospitable
to
use
your
language
solely
because
there
were
no
heirs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
do
not
understand
what
i
am
talking
about
and
that
is
the
reason…
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
reason
the
statute
is
in
trouble
is
because
of
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
saying
is
you
are
saying
because
of
a
peculiar
fact
of
this
case,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
say?
you
are
saying
it
does
not
bar
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
it
does
not
bar
you
then
by
what
do
you
continue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
call
an
administrator
of
the
will
and
in
louisiana
it
is
a
funny
name?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
state
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
clay
shaw
filed
a
civil
rights
action
against
new
orleans
district
attorney,
jim
garrison,
and
others
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
shaw
for
his
alleged
in
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy.
when
shaw
died
before
trial,
his
executor
sought
to
be
substituted
as
plaintiff.
the
district
court
allowed
the
substitution,
holding
the
shaw's
action
did
not
abate
on
his
death,
because
shaw
was
not
survived
by
one
of
the
close
relatives
specified
in
the
louisiana
survivorship
statute,
the
court
recognized
that
his
action
will
abate
under
state
law.
but
the
court
refused
to
apply
this
law
and
it
instead
created
a
federal
common
law
rule
of
absolute
survival
of
civil
rights
actions
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
under
42
united
states
code,
section
1988,
we
are
required
to
apply
the
state
survivorship
statute
to
a
civil
rights
action
unless
the
statute
is
“inconsistent”
with
federal
law.
we
can
find
no
such
inconsistency
here.
the
advocation
of
the
louisiana
statute
who
have
no
independent
adverse
effect
on
the
policies
underlying
the
civil
rights
laws,
and
we
can't
hold
that
the
statute
inconsistent
with
federal
law
merely
because
it
will
cause
a
particular
action
to
abate.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
mr.
justice
white
joined.
