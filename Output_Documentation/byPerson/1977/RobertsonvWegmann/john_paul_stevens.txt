justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wegmann,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice’s
question,
supposing
he
left
the
will
he
did
leave
and
had
also
been
survived
by
a
son
and
in
his
will
he
said
i
do
not
want
my
son
to
have
any
benefit
from
my
estate.
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
who
would
own
the
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
us
say
you
had
those
reasons
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
theoretically
possible,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
law
would
prevail,
the
federal
common
law
that
i
take
it
you
say
gives
the
right
to
the
estate
or
the
louisiana
statute
that
says
it
goes
to
the
son?
is
that
not
the
kind
of
question
we
have
here…
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
he
maybe
just
said
in
the
will,
i
want
this
cause
of
action
to
be
prosecuted
by
my
estate,
not
for
the
benefit
of
my
son,
but
for
the
benefit
of
my
collateral
heirs
and
under
federal
common
law,
would
that
wish
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
under
louisiana
law,
there
was
a
son
available
who
could
claim
under
1988?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
i
asked
you
a
question,
maybe
that
is
improbable
hypothetical,
but
if
we
accept
your
theory
of
the
case
and
there
are
i
suppose,
there
will
be
possibilities
of
conflict
between
the
federal
rule
as
to
who
should
get
the
surviving
cause
of
action
and
the
state
law.
the
state
law
might
provide
as
i
say
the
son
gets
the
claim
and
under
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it
goes
to
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
some
kind
of
a
federal
basis
for
our
doing
this,
for
giving
preference
to
the
estate
over
the
person
of
the
louisiana
statute
says
should
have
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
kind
of
questions
are
around
the
corner
if
we
accept
your
theory
of
the
case.
this
is
not
the
only
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
in
the
1983
action
is
going
to
die
certainly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wegmann,
let
me
go
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
question
about
statutes
and
limitations.
now,
i
understand
there
is
no
limitations
issue
in
this
case,
but
your
theory
is
as
i
understand
it
is
that
you
do
not
look
to
state
law
if
the
state
law
does
not
facilitate
recovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
respond
in
terms
of
the
statute
limitations.
if
an
action
is
brought
say
five
years
after
it
accrued
and
there
is
a
four-year
state
statute
limitations
in
the
state
now
that
would
tend
to
defeat
the
claim
and
under
1988,
i
had
thought
we
would
then
look
at
the
state
law
to
see
if
that
statute
of
limitations
apply.
would
you
agree
that
we
look
at
the
state
law
in
that
circumstance
or
would
you
say
now
because
it
is
not
hospitable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
look
it,
but
why
do
we
look
the
state
law
and
in
limitation
situations,
but
not
in
abatement
situations
that
is
what
i
do
not
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
do
we
not
apply
the
same
test
in
abatement
and
say
is
the
state
statute
dealing
with
survivorship
a
reasonable
statute,
if
it
something
that
says
no
civil
rights
action
shall
ever
survive
why
we
obviously
would
not
look
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
not
the
same
reasoning
applicable
to
my
four-year
statute
limitation,
precisely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
reasonable.
i
note
that
we
assume
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
does
not
your
argument
also
say
we
want
to
apply
a
four-year
statute
limitation?
i
just
do
not
follow
your
reasoning?
maybe
i
am
missing
something.
