justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
some
state
has
not
modified
the
common
law
at
all,
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
common
law
rule
just
could
not
possibly
violate
this
one
proviso
you
just
spoke
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
common
law
the
statute
refers
to
is
state
common
law,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
although
i
suppose
that
if
the
state
by
a
judicial
decision
changed
the
common
law,
it
would
be
acceptable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
louisiana
would
you
say
that
only
the
common
law
rule
could
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
absent
1988
to
construe
that
the
statute
as
providing
for
survivorship?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
1988
does
not
speak
specifically
of
survivorship,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
look
for
example
to
state
law
to
determine
the
question
of
immunity
of
government
officials
under
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
mentioned
in
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
time
to
read
that
in
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
some
things
that
you
misconstrue
into
a
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
theory
of
forced
heirship
apply
where
only
a
parent
survives
and
the
siblings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
sibling
also
if
there
is
only
a
brother?
as
i
recall
your
statuteâ€¦
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
then
a
sibling
survived.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
court
of
appeals
is
the
only
one
to
have
applied
that
second
doctrine?
