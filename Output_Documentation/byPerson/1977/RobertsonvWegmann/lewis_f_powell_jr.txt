mr.
wegmann,
the
chief
justice
asked
you
whether
the
opposition
would
be
the
same
if
the
estate
had
been
left
to
the
ford
foundation
and
your
answer
was
in
the
affirmative.
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
same
also
if
the
entire
estate
that
had
been
led
to
the
ku
klux
klan?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
not
precisely
be
compatibleâ€¦
