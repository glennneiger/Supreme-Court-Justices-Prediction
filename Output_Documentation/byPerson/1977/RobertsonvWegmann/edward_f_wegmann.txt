mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
louisiana
has
the
civil
law
and
not
the
common
law
and
the
adoption
by
the
courts
of
the
state
law
if
the
state
law
is
hospitable
to
the
plaintiff’s
action,
it
is
of
no
consequence
that
we
deal
with
the
louisiana
civil
code
and
that
article
2315
of
the
code
is
our
survival
statute.
all
concerned
agree
that
if
you
are
going
to
interpret
1988
to
mean
that
the
state
law
must
be
applied,
the
statute
that
would
applied
would
be
article
2315
of
the
civil
code
and
the
action
of
the
plaintiff
would
abate.
we
very
briefly
stated
our
position
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
state
law
is
that
the
state
law
applies
solely
and
only
if
through
the
application
of
the
state
law,
the
action
will
be
allowed
to
survive.
that
any
inhospitable
statute
or
state
survival
statute
is
not
to
be
applied
because
of
the
very
simple
fact
that
the
trend
and
the
theory
of
the
civil
rights
laws
is
for
the
actions
to
continue
despite
the
fact
of
the
death
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
do
not
think
i
have
any
doubt
but
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
1988.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir,
i
agree
with
that
and
this
is
exactly
what
judge
wisdom
of
the
5th
circuit
did
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
would
do
it
exactly
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir,
because
you
will
find
that
all
of
the
circuits
which
have
considered
this
question
have
applied
the
state
law
solely
and
only
because
that
state
law
was
hospitable
to
the
action
and
allowed
the
action
to
continue.
this
is
the
only
case
which
i
have
been
able
to
locate
in
which
the
state
law
is
inhospitable
to
the
continuance
of
the
plaintiff’s
claim
as
a
result
of
which
the
5th
circuit
did
not
apply
the
louisiana
law.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
we
had
one
instance.
i
think
it
was
the
lefton
case
in
which
the
state
statute
of
limitations
was
10
days.
the
court
refused
to
apply
this
state
statute
because
they
said
that
it
was
ridiculous.
it
was
not
anybody’s
intention
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
their
rights
through
a
10-day
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
the
more
normal
statutes
of
limitation
would
be
one,
two
and
perhaps
four
years
and
they
do
vary
from
state
to
state.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
but
we
do
not
here
have
a
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
shaws’
case…
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
well,
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
have
to
end
to
this
case
because
this
case
was
filed
before
shaw
died.
we
do
not
have
to
contend
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
we
can
say
that.
it
is
inhospitable
because
shaw
did
not
leave
heirs,
shaw
was
not
married.
he
could
be
penalized
because
he
did
not
marry?
is
he
to
be
penalized
because
his
parents
died
before
him?
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
no,
sir,
i
did
not
say
that
it
is.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
there
were
heirs.
he
died
testate,
but
there
were
no
familial
descendants,
ascendants
or
collaterals
required
by
article
2315
of
the
code.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
he
did
have
a
family.
he
did
have
some
collaterals.
he
had
some
nephews
and
nieces
who
survived.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
if
i
might
finish
sir.
if
he
had
not
died
testate,
but
had
died
intestate,
there
were
collaterals
who
were
there
to
inherit
the
action.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
no,
sir
but
you
are
asking
me
about…
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
do
not
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
say
it
does
not
bar
me
from
continuing.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
continue
because
wearing
my
hat
as
executor
of
clay
shaw’s
succession,
i
have
been
allowed
by
the
trial
court
to
substitute
myself
as
a
plaintiff
in
this
damage
suit
and
the
trial
court
in
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion
affirmed
by
a
second
well
reasoned
opinion
with
no
emotion
in
it
despite
the
remarks
of
petitioner
to
that
effect
has
held
that
because
the
article
2315
of
the
louisiana
code
is
inhospitable
to
the
application
of
state
law
that
it
does
not
apply
and
we
bring
into
play
the
federal
common
law
which
mr.
justice
stewart
spoke
of
and
the
appellate
court
in
its
opinion
made
the
direct
pronouncement
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
common
law
is
alive
and
well
and
it
is
the
federal
common
law
which
was
applied
both
by
the
trial
court
as
well
as
by
the
appellate
court.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir,
it
would.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
there
have
been
six
statutes
as
a
rule
for
the
protection
and
the
taking
care
of
the
descendants
or
the
dependents
of
the
individuals
who
may
have
been
injured
or
killed
by
virtue
of
negligence
of
some
third
party,
ordinarily
that
is
the
case.
but
as
i
said
before,
if
shaw
had
died
intestate,
there
are
nieces
and
nephews
surviving
him.
they
were
beneficiaries
in
his
will,
but
it
so
happens
as
it
is
so
often
the
case
in
life,
his
closest
friend
was
closer
to
him
than
those
collaterals,
aunts,
uncles,
nieces
and
nephews
and
so
he
left
his
good
friend,
named
his
good
friend
as
the
residuary
legatee
which
is
our
louisiana
term
of
his
succession,
one
of
the
assets
of
which
is
this
cause
of
action.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
well,
your
hypothetical
is
a
little
difficult
to
answer,
mr.
justice
stevens
because
of
the
fact
in
louisiana,
we
have
what
is
known
as
the
law
of
forced
heirship
and
i
can
only
disinherit
my
descendants
for
these
specific
reasons
which
are
enunciated
in
the
code.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
in
succession
procedure
and
it
is
next
to
impossible.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
theoretical
yes,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
no.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
do
not
know
that
i
understand
your
question.
you
are
saying
assume
that
he
had
a
son
and
he
disinherited
that
son?
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
assuming
that
he
did
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
code
and
the
disinheritance
of
a
son.
i
have
to
make
the
assumption
because
we
do
have
our
law
of
forced
heirship
which
we
are
very
proud
of
and
which
is
very
difficult
to
avoid.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
because
he
died
testate
and
using
your
hypothesis,
he
said
i
want
this
claim
to
be
processed
by
my
executive
for
the
benefit
of
my
residuary
legatee.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
think
we
are
on
a
tangent
because
we
are
dealing…
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
am
quite
aware
of
that.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir,
if
the
ascendant
is
a
forced
heir.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
collaterals
are
not
forced
heirs,
no.
forced
heirships
are
ascendants
and
descendants.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
forced
heir?
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
we
call
it
a
succession.
we
call
it
the
succession
of
clay
l.
shaw.
we
do
not
refer
to
it
as
an
estate.
we
do
not
have
a
final
decree
as
you
have
in
the
common
law
states.
we
have
what
is
known
as
a
judgment
of
possession
recognizing
the
heirs
as
such
and
placing
and
putting
them
into
possession
of
the
decedent’s
succession
sometimes
immediately,
sometimes
after
administration
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
succession
and
the
involvements.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
am
afraid
it
would
have
been.
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir
i
have
to
be
consistent.
it
is
of
no
consequence
who
the
residuary
legatee
of
the
estate
is,
rather
the
succession.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
it
would
make
it
even
worse
mr.
justice
powell.
supposing
by
some
strange
whim
of
faith
he
had
left,
he
had
named
the
very
nefarious
mr.
jim
garrison
as
his
residuary
legatee;
my
position
would
have
to
be
the
same.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
am
afraid
so
this
plaintiff
would
have.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
was
asked
that
question
repeatedly
in
the
circuit
court
when
i
argued
this
case
and
one
of
the
justices
could
not
just
simply
could
not
believe
what
my
response
was
because
i
think
it
is
just
that
simple
and
it
is
simple
proposition
as
stated
by
professor
theus
in
this
louisiana
law
review
article
which
i
cited
to
you
that
if
a
state
law
allows
the
action
to
survive
it
is
hospitable
and
the
state
law
is
applicable.
if
the
state
law
abates
the
action
it
is
inhospitable
and
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
am
sure
you
would.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
can
only
give
you
what
i
have
read
of
the
cases
and
apparently
the
reasoning
is
that
where
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
state
is
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
in
louisiana
it
is
one
year,
in
mississippi
i
believe
it
is
two
years
as
i
recall
over
in
georgia
it
is
four
years,
it
is
quite
simple,
it
construes
these
to
be
reasonable
periods
of
time.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
think
i
could
best
give
you
the
appellate
court’s
reasoning
in
that
regard
and
that
was
judge
wisdom
established
a
three-step
procedure
which
he
said
we
should
follow.
he
said
is
the
civil
rights
act
deficient
in
furnishing
a
remedy
for
vindication.
that
is
the
first
step.
he
said
then
if
the
act
is
deficient
we
look
to
state
law.
he
then
said
if
state
law
is
available
we
must
insure
that
state
law
is
not
inconsistent
with
federal
and
constitutional
law.
taking
that
three
step
procedure
he
held
that
there
was
a
gap
because
1980,
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
survival,
a
survival
line.
he
said
that
it
is
deficient
and
we
look
then
to
the
state
law,
but
he
said
the
state
law
is
inconsistent
because
the
theory
of
congress
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
acts
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
federally
guaranteed
rights
of
the
citizen
were
protected.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
as
i
say
i
can
only
refer
you
to
the
left
in
case
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
was
10
days
and
the
court
said
that
it
was
unreasonable.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
i
am
injecting
the
reasonable
in
there.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
because
the
courts
have
said
that
we
want
these
civil
rights
claim
to
go
forward.
i
had
the
same
problem.
i
did
not
enjoin
garrison
once.
i
sought
to
enjoin
twice.
i
sought
to
enjoin
garrison
prior
to
the
first
trial.
i
was
faced
with
danbrowski.
danbrowski
this
court
said
applied
only
to
the
protection
of
my
first
amendment
rights.
the
trial
court
in
granting
my
temporary
restraining
order
adopted
my
argument.
if
the
central
government
was
here
to
protect
my
first
amendment
rights
why
was
not
it
here
to
protect
all
of
my
federally
guaranteed
rights.
my
first
injunction
request
was
flatly
denied.
we
went
to
trial,
but
then
when
this
malicious
district
attorney
came
along
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
the
case,
we
had
a
40
day
trial.
we
had
a
unanimous
12-man
verdict
of
acquittal
within
less
than
an
hour
after
a
40-day
trial.
on
the
very
next
working
day
garrison
himself
goes
in
and
files
a
bill
of
information
against
shaw
charging
that
he
committed
perjury
when
he
took
the
witness
stand
to
defend
himself
and
testified
that
he
did
not
know
and
had
never
seen
or
was
he
ever
acquainted
with
oswald.
the
state
court
refused
to
suppress,
refused
to
dismiss.
i
went
in
the
federal
court
and
sought
the
gain
and
injunction.
fortunately
by
this
time,
we
had
younger
versus
and
harris
and
perez
versus
ladesma
and
i
was
able
to
convince
the
trial
court
that
i
had
those
special
circumstances
which
would
enable
that
court
to
enjoin
that
second
state
court
criminal
proceeding
and
the
verdict
and
the
judgment
of
that
trial
court
in
that
second
injunction
suit
was
maintained
again
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
court
refused
writs.
this
is
not
the
first
time
the
shaw
case
has
been
before
this
court.
after
the
first
injunction,
a
suit
was
filed
and
denied.
i
filed
a
very
substantial
jurisdictional
statement
seeking
relief
from
this
court.
i
have
been
fighting
this
thing
since
march
1,
1967
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
despite
counsel’s
statements
to
the
contrary
sure
there
is
emotion.
this
man’s
federally
guaranteed
rights
were
maliciously
violated.
this
man
was
used
as
nothing
more
than
a
conduit
to
an
adversary
preceding
for
the
trial
the
warren
commission
report.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
yes,
sir
it
reaches
it
for
the
reason
and
that
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
intent
of
the
courts
is
to
prevent
people
like
garrison
for
misusing
his
public
office,
to
stop
conduct
which
is
more
similar
to
what
we
might
term
a
police
state
than
a
democracy
and
to
protect
those
rights
to
the
fullest
extent
even
after
the
death
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
fortunately
they
are
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
do
something
about
it
again
because
now
he
is
running
for
the
bench
and
god
willing
he
will
be
defeated
as
he
was
last
time
he
ran
for
the
bench.
i
had
a
lovely
argument
onlined
here
for
you,
but
i
think
that
i
have
given
you
my
position.
well,
let
me
say
one
more
thing.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
injunction
suit
where
the
court
specifically
found
that
shaw’s
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated
were
not
binding
upon
the
defendants
in
this
civil
proceeding.
i
am
not
here
asserting
that
those
findings
are
binding
upon
these
defendants
at
this
time.
i
am
here
telling
the
court
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
you
must
take
my
complaint
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
as
being
factually
accurate
in
every
respect,
you
have
another
basis
for
taking
it
as
factually
accurate
and
taking
as
a
statement
of
fact.
the
fact
that
shaw’s
federally
guaranteed
rights
were
violated
because
it
has
been
judicially
adjudicated
that
such
is
the
fact
and
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
a
simple
procedure.
we
can
theorize.
we
can
analyze.
we
can
analogize.
if
the
state
statue
allows
the
action
to
survive,
the
state
statute
is
applied
and
this
is
what
the
civil
circuits
which
have
considered
the
question
have
done.
the
seventh
circuit
did
it
recently
in
byrd
versus
johnson
decided
in
december
of
1977.
if
the
state
statute
is
inhospitable
it
does
not
apply
and
we
use
this
federal
common
law
which
is
alive
and
well.
i
submit
to
you.
mr.
edward
f.
wegmann
so
far
as
i
know,
yes
sir.
they
found
that
the
state
law
was
inhospitable
and
hence
refused
to
apply
the
state
law
and
instead
of
i
applied
the
federal
common
law.
i
submit
that
the
