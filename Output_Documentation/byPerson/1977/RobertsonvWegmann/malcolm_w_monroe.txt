mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
pertinent
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
original
plaintiff,
clay
shaw
filled
the
suit
under
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
against
jim
garrison,
then
district
attorney
of
orleans
parish
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
certain
alleged
co-conspirators,
including
petitioner,
a
prominent
new
orleans
businessman.
plaintiff
claimed
violations
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
connection
with
the
district
attorney’s
prosecution
of
him
for
a
new
orleans
based
conspiracy
to
assassinate
president
kennedy
and
the
district
attorney’s
subsequent
attempt
to
prosecute
shaw
for
perjury.
during
the
pendency
of
his
civil
rights
action,
shaw
died.
he
was
a
bachelor,
leaving
no
spouse,
child,
parent
or
sibling,
but
only
a
will
naming
a
friend
as
residuary
legatee
of
his
estate.
the
executor
of
shaw’s
estate,
the
respondent
here
today,
was
permitted
over
objections
of
defendants
to
substitute
himself
as
plaintiff.
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
because
it
did
not
survive
shaw’s
death
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
under
which
law,
there
is
provision
for
survival
of
actions
in
favor
of
the
stated
familial
beneficiaries
only.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
louisiana
law
of
survivorship
between
actions
for
damage
to
property
as
opposed
to
personal
actions.
as
to
all
personal
actions,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
limitation
as
to
the
rights
of
the
familial
beneficiaries
are
enforced
and
the
further
basis
of
course
of
that
motion
to
dismiss
was
that
under
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
act,
the
law
of
louisiana
providing
for
the
limited
survivorship
must
be
applied
to
this
action.
the
district
court
denied
defendants’
motions
and
on
interlocutory
appeal,
the
5th
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court’s
holding
at
a
federal
common
law
of
absolute
survivorship
of
section
1983
actions
should
be
formulated
since
estate
law
to
which
the
federal
courts
must
look
under
section
1988
does
not
permit
this
action
to
survive
and
is
therefore
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
civil
rights
act.
despite
both
courts’
acknowledgement
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
entirely
silent
as
to
survivorship
in
1983
actions.
this
is
a
case
which
has
been
charged
with
considerable
emotion,
arising
as
it
does
from
the
assassination
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
subsequent
prosecution
by
the
district
attorney
of
orleans
parish
of
a
well
known
new
orleans
businessman
for
his
alleged
role
in
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
perpetrate
that
assassination.
the
extent
of
that
emotion
is
perhaps
reflected
by
the
referral
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
to
shaw’s
injunction
suit
against
a
district
attorney
as
constituting
established
facts
in
this
case,
although
neither
petitioner
robertson
or
garrison’s
other
co-defendants
in
the
civil
rights
action,
who
are
defendants
in
that
injunction
suit
and
obviously
any
findings
there
could
not
be
binding
on
them
in
this
proceeding
and
also
by
respondents’
repeated
references
to
the
district
court’s
characterization
of
the
matter
as
one
of
the
most
bizarre
episodes
in
american
political
and
legal
history
and
the
court
of
appeals’
designation
of
the
facts
of
this
case
as
kafkaesque,
although
this
matter
has
been
before
both
of
those
courts
simply
on
defendant’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
all
of
the
defendants
are
still
living,
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no
sir,
he
is
not.
he
has
been
in
private
practice
for
several
years
and
is
readying
for
a
candidacy
for
the
state
court
of
appeals.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
there
is
one
other
friend
alleged
to
be
a
member
of
his
staff,
dr.
fadda,
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
that
is
correct
sir.
especially
in
light
of
this
emotional
background
of
the
case,
the
holding
of
the
two
lower
courts,
refusing
to
apply
the
state
law
of
survivorship
to
this
case
pursuant
to
section
1988,
since
that
law
would
not
permit
this
action
to
continue
and
instead
fabricating
out
of
new
cloth,
a
federal
common
law
of
absolute
survivorship
brings
to
our
mind
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
the
nixon
case
when
he
said
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
of
a
tendency
of
great
cases
like
hard
cases
to
make
bad
law
went
on
to
observe
the
dangers
inherent
when
some
accident
of
immediate
overwhelming
interest
appeals
to
the
feelings
and
distorts
the
judgment.
these
immediate
interests
exercise
a
hydraulic
pressure
which
makes
what
previously
seems
clear
and
seem
doubtful
and
before
which
even
well
settled
principles
of
law
will
bend.
petitioner
is
here
today
before
this
court
seeking
to
neutralize
the
past
hydraulic
pressures
in
this
case
and
to
restore
the
subtle
principles
of
law
which
had
been
bent
by
the
courts
below.
we
may
start
then
with
the
basic
principle
that
there
has
never
been
any
common
law
rule,
federal
or
state
of
survivorship
of
personal
actions.
thus
we
submit
survivorship
of
an
action
is
quite
different
from
the
matter
of
recoverable
damages
which
was
the
question
we
believe
sought
to
be
presented
to
this
court
in
jones
vs.
hildebrandt
and
as
to
which
they
have
been
established
federal
rules
which
the
federal
courts
have
chosen
to
follow
rather
than
state
rules
as
was
the
case
when
the
3rd
circuit
in
basista
vs.
weir.
as
to
survivorship
of
actions
however,
we
reiterate
there
has
never
been
any
such
federal
rule
to
be
utilized.
a
further
basic
principle
recognized
by
the
5th
circuit
in
its
earlier
brazier
vs.
cherry
is
that
any
amelioration
of
the
harshness
of
the
principle
of
abatement
of
actions
upon
death
of
the
injured
person
must
come
from
legislation.
that
is
certainly
as
much
an
american
rule
as
is
the
need
for
legislative
authority
for
the
award
of
attorney’s
fees
which
was
acknowledged
by
this
court
in
alyeska
pipeline
service
company
vs.
wilderness
society.
turning
then
to
the
civil
rights
act,
it
also
spans
beyond
question
that
congress
made
no
provision
for
survival
of
civil
rights
actions
under
1983.
both
courts
below
readily
conceded
that
point
as
have
all
courts
for
as
we
are
aware,
which
have
considered
this
question
and
certainly
this
court
in
moor
vs.
county
of
alameda
also
recognized
the
silence
of
congress
as
to
survivorship
of
1983
actions.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
did
speak
explicitly
when
it
enacted
1988
to
provide
that
when
there
is
such
a
gap
in
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act,
a
common
law,
as
modified
and
changed
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
the
forum
so
far
as
the
same
as
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
united
states,
shall
be
extended
to
and
govern
the
cause.
thus
as
the
appellate
courts
in
the
4th
circuit
in
dean
vs.
shirer,
the
5th
in
the
brazier
case,
the
6th
in
hall
vs.
wooten
in
opinion
written
by
the
present
solicitor
general
and
the
7th
in
spence
vs.
sterris
have
all
recognized
that
congress
in
enacting
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
act
had
adopted
the
state
law
of
the
forum
as
the
federal
law
or
federal
common
law
of
survivorship
of
civil
rights
action.
amicus
in
its
brief
filed
with
the
court,
simply
clouds
the
issue
we
submit
by
referring
to
choice
of
law
rules.
since
they
only
apply
when
there
is
no
such
congressional
mandate
as
section
1988.
this
court
so
recognized
in
the
moor
case,
when
in
considering
section
1988,
it
said
that
this
meaning
moor,
is
a
wholly
different
case
from
those
in
which
lacking
any
clear
expression
of
congressional
will,
we
have
been
called
upon
to
decide
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
state
law
or
to
fashion
a
single
federal
rule
in
order
to
fill
the
interstices
of
federal
law.
in
the
instant
case
we
submit,
accordingly
involved
statutory
interpretation
and
not
choice
of
law
rules.
this
court
should
cast
aside
these
false
issues
which
have
been
injected
and
follow
we
submit,
the
submitted
clear
language
of
1988.
the
only
qualification
which
congress
stated
in
that
section
was
that
the
state
law
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
mr.
justice
white,
we
would
submit
so.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
we
submit
sir
that
under
the
direct
dictate
of
congress
in
1988
that
that
law
of
the
state
would
have
to
be
applied
since
the
law
is
entirely
silent
as
to
survivorship.
there
is
no
rule
at
all
to
which
the
court
can
turn
and
it
is
a
matter…
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
i
would
say
so
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
that
is
an
interesting…
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no,
sir
as
i
think
you
would
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
as
enacted
by
the
constitution
and
statutes
of
that
state
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
i
would
say
sir
that
if
that
were
the
rule
in
louisiana,
i
would
think
that
under
1988,
it
would
have
to
be
applied.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
i
believe
so.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
assume
of
course
that
we
would
have
the
situation
say
in
this
case
that
for
whatever
reason,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
would
reach
a
different
interpretation
of
the
civil
code
article
2315
and
has
been
the
case
today.
i
would
say
then
that
if
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
construing
or
interpreting
the
law
whether
it
be
common
law
or
statute,
to
say
that
there
is
no
survivorship
whatever.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
i
would
say
so
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
precisely,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
i
think
that
is
quite
possible
and
i
think
that
is
true.
as
far
as
i
know,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
readily
concede
as
far
as
i
know
the
survivorship
law
of
louisiana
is
the
only
state
in
enacting
qualifications
to
the
survivorship
rule
which
follows
the
federal
pattern
which
you
find
throughout
the
federal
statutes
in
designating
familial
beneficiaries
who
have
that
right.
now,
there
are
some
i
think
22
states
which
have
enacted…
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
yes,
i
understand
sir.
that
certainly
would
be
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
statute
law
of
louisiana
to
the
same
extent.
we
submit
that
all
of
the
courts
being
in
agreement
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
silent
as
to
survivorship
of
1983
and
that
there
is
a
void
in
that
respect,
it
runs
counter
to
all
basic
tenets
of
logic
to
say
that
the
louisiana
law
providing
for
limited
survivorship
is
inconsistent
with
that
act.
there
cannot
be
any
inconsistency
with
something
which
does
not
exist.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
absent
1988,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
would
bring
into
play
those
doctrines
which
amicus
discussed
at
considerable
length
in
its
brief
about
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
the
choice
of
law
which
of
course
is
being
debated
all
the
time
and
it
is
causing
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
considerable
problem
as
to
the
choice
of
law
and
what
law
to
apply.
so
i
think
absent
1988,
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
would
have
to
be
guided
by
those
principles
and
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
tenets
we
are
holding
forth
today
that
with
1988
that
one
must
follow
the
dictate
of
congress
and
one
does
not
look
to
the
choice
of
law
rules.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no
sir,
all
gaps
and
i
think
congress
was
being
all
encompassing.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
1983,
the
question
of
immunity
again,
i
think
might
be
analogized…
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no,
sir,
it
is
not,
but
i
think
it
maybe
analogized
to
my
point
about
recoverable
damages.
there
you
already
have
a
well
established
body
of
law
as
to
immunity.
there
is
i
think
a
federal
common
law.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
yes,
sir,
federal
law,
so
therefore,
you
do
not
have
a
void
or
a
gap
in
the
federal
law,
would
be
my
position.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
yes,
sir,
i
think
you
can
sir,
mr.
justice
white
because
the
premise
of
1983…
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no,
1983
starts
off
by
saying
in
effect
that
when
it
commands
the
courts
to
apply
its
jurisdiction
under
the
civil
rights
act
in
accordance
with
the
federal
law.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
it
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
i
think
in
immunity
cases
as
i
recall.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
well,
it
could
be
approached
from
the
matter
of
construction
of
the
statute.
i
think
some
of
the
cases
would
indicate
to
me
that
they
consider
that
as
being
an
existing
rule
of
law.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
no,
sir.
that
is
my
point.
i
think
that
rightly
or
wrongly,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
gone
that
way
is
my
point
sir.
we
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
acts
to
support
the
proposition
that
when
congress
enacted
section
1986,
in
1866,
section
1983
in
1871
that
it
intended
that
there
should
be
an
absolute
survival
of
actions
under
the
civil
rights
acts.
to
the
contrary,
the
survivorship
law
of
louisiana
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
civil
rights
acts,
we
feel
is
demonstrated
by
the
action
of
congress
itself
in
1871
in
enacting
section
1986
when
it
rejected
a
senate
amendment
and
a
subsequent
committee
version,
both
of
which
included
a
very
broad
absolute
survivorship
of
actions
provision.
instead
1986,
as
adopted
by
congress
provided
as
explained
by
representative
shelabaga,
the
floor
manager
for
the
bill
for
a
limited
survivorship
actions
under
both
sections
1986
and
section
1985
which
are
the
sections
of
the
ku
klux
act
specifically
aimed
at
the
acts
of
invidious
discrimination
of
the
ku
klux
klan
which
so
often
resulted
ultimately
in
death
and
which
was
certainly
the
prime
motivation
behind
the
enactment
of
the
so
called
ku
klux
act
in
1871.
if
the
purpose
and
policy
of
congress
were
in
fact
that
regardless
of
the
provisions
of
state
law
to
be
applied
under
1988,
there
should
be
absolute
survivorship
of
actions
under
1983.
it
seems
obvious
to
petition
at
least
that
congress
would
have
required
the
same
result
as
to
actions
under
sections
1985
and
1986.
however,
again
representative
shelabaga
recognizing
that
under
common
law,
there
is
no
survivorship
of
actions
for
a
wrong
to
the
deceased
person,
praised
the
limited
survivorship
clause
of
the
amendment
which
became
section
1986
and
advised
his
colleagues
in
the
house
that
it
operates
as
to
actions
under
section
1985
which
was
section
2
of
the
bill
as
well
as
those
under
section
1986
which
was
section
3
of
the
bill.
he
went
on
to
explain
that
that
clause
was
in
his
words
“intended
to
secure
it,”
that
is
the
right
of
action,
“to
the
family
of
the
deceased,
to
the
exclusion,
for
example
of
the
creditors
just
as
all
statutes
do
in
the
case
where
death
occurs
from
railroad
negligence.
if
congress
had
intended
that
there
be
all
encompassing
unlimited
survivorship
section
1983
actions
as
the
courts
below
have
held,
congress
would
simply
have
so
provided
expressly.”
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
deterrence
objective
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
requires
rejection
of
the
louisiana
law
of
limited
survivorship.
here
again
it
is
inconceivable
to
petitioner
that
any
such
objective
of
congress
was
so
strong
as
to
permit
the
federal
courts
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
dictates
of
1988
to
follow
and
apply
this
state
law
of
survivorship
when
congress
itself
adopted
1986
as
in
that
section,
a
very
similar,
limited
survivorship
of
1985
and
1986
actions.
certainly
any
objective
of
deterrence
which
congress
had
in
mind
would
have
been
even
stronger
we
submit
with
respect
to
the
types
of
invidious
class
action
embraced
in
those
latter
sections
of
the
act
than
would
be
so
as
to
merely
a
state
action
type
of
violation
prescribed
by
section
1983.
the
same
analysis
it
seems
to
us
is
also
appropriate
with
the
argument
of
amicus
that
louisiana’s
survival
statute
must
be
rejected
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
complete
justice
theme
of
the
civil
rights
acts.
in
fact,
not
only
does
section
1986
restrict
the
survival
to
certain
designated
beneficiaries,
but
unlike
the
louisiana
statute,
it
goes
further
and
the
federal
act
also
limits
those
beneficiaries
to
a
recovery
of
only
$5,000.00.
thus,
we
submit
the
louisiana
statute
cannot
be
said
to
be
out
of
tune
with
the
federal
complete
justice
theme.
moreover,
louisiana
statute
is
entirely
consistent
with
every
other
federal
statute
which
has
provided
for
survivorship.
thus,
whether
the
injured
party
is
a
railroad
worker,
the
seaman,
the
lord
of
the
admiralty,
a
longshoreman
harbor
worker,
or
one
killed
on
the
high
seas,
his
action
upon
death
survives
only
in
favor
of
certain
designated
familial
beneficiaries,
not
a
friend
remembered
in
decedent’s
will
as
residuary
legatee.
congress
has
accordingly
directed,
we
submit,
a
course
of
action
to
be
followed
by
the
federal
courts
in
this
action
and
that
is
fill
the
interstices
of
the
federal
statute
with
the
state
law
of
survivorship,
adopt
as
federal
law
or
federal
common
law
if
one
will,
the
louisiana
law
of
survivorship.
congress
having
spoken
as
it
did
in
section
1988
with
respect
to
adoption
of
state
law,
and
having
been
otherwise
entirely
silent
as
to
survivorship
of
section
1983
actions,
the
view
of
this
court
in
alyeska
as
to
award
of
attorney’s
fees
in
a
civil
rights
action
is
appropriate
here.
that
is
the
civil
rights
acts
do
not
contain
the
necessary
congressional
authorization
for
the
courts
to
formulate
a
federal
common
law
of
absolute
survivorship.
as
this
court
said
in
chevron
oil
vs.
usan,
interpreting
a
provision
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
very
similar
to
section
1988,
congress
made
clear
provision
for
filling
in
the
gaps
in
federal
law.
it
did
not
intend
that
federal
courts
fill
in
those
gaps
by
creating
new
federal
common
law.
the
several
arguments
advanced
by
respondent
in
amicas
as
well
as
by
the
courts
below
as
to
the
need
for
uniform
and
absolute
survivorship
of
civil
rights
actions
are
policy
matters,
we
submit,
which
are
properly
addressed
to
congress.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
law
of
louisiana
as
to
survivorship
of
actions
should
have
been
followed
and
applied
by
the
courts
below
to
this
action
pursuant
to
section
1988
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
that
since
plaintiff
left
none
of
the
designated
familial
beneficiaries
in
whom
this
action
could
survive,
this
action
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
malcolm
w.
monroe
we
submit
the
matter
and
if
it
please
the
court?
