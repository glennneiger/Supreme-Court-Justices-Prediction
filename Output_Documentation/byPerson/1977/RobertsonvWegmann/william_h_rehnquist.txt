justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action
or
does
that
apply
across
the
board
to
any?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
otherwise
you
would
have
one
rule
in
louisiana
and
another
rule
for
the
other
49
states
i
presume?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was
directed
more
to
this
difference
between
the
civil
law
which
i
understand
pertinent
in
louisiana
and
to
depend
entirely
on
code
provision
and
the
other
49
states
which
have
more
or
less
of
common
law
and
ascendance
and
the
idea
of
the
seamless
web
where
there
is
no
statute
to
common
law
presumably
governed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
are
not
arguing
based
on
1988
because
i
do
not
see
anything
in
there
about
trend
or
hospitable
or
that
type
of
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that
in
1988
if
you
look
at
your
own
brief
on
page
6,
the
language
of
the
statute
that
it
says
in
effect,
the
common
law
as
modified
and
changed
by
the
constitution,
statutes
of
the
state
wherein
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
such
civil
or
criminal
cause
is
held
so
far
as
the
same
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
laws
of
the
united
states
shall
be
applied.
do
you
not
have
to
show
that
the
louisiana
statute
is
inconsistent
either
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
with
a
law
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
maybe
a
matter
of
opinion
as
to
whether
he
did
it
or
not.
how
would
you
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
1983?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
applying
statute
of
limitations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
had
other
case
in
which
more
normal
statutes
of
limitations
have
been
applied,
have
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
have
those
not
been
applied
under
1988?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
survival
different
than
statute
of
limitations
if
you
are
going
to
turn
you
argument
on
1988?
