yes,
but
my
brother
whiteâ€™s
question
was
what
if
it
is
not
changed
by
constitutional
statute,
but
by
judicial
decision
of
louisiana,
then
what
do
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
which,
the
judicial
decision
or
the,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
it
says
is
as
modified
and
changed
by
the
constitution
and
statutes
of
the
state
wherein
the
court
having
jurisdiction
is
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statutory
changed
for
purposes
of
1983?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
we
have
just
said
that
the
immunity
under
1983
was
a
matter
of
construing
1983?
it
was
common
law.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
opinion
in
number
77-178,
robertson
v.
wegmannwill
be
delivered
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
