mr.
robert
masur
that
decision
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
but
the
court
did
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
robert
masur
well,
first
of
all
your
honor,
it
would
involve
an
ordinance
and
not
a
statute.
mr.
robert
masur
as
to
challenge
to
a
statute
on
constitutional
grounds
would
go
to
illinois
supreme
court,
but
not
to
an
ordinance.
mr.
robert
masur
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
miller
is
an
ex-offender
who
was
denied
a
license
necessary
to
seek
employment
in
the
city
of
chicago
as
a
public
chauffeur.
before
the
court
today
is
a
question
of
constitutionality
of
that
part
of
the
ordinance
which
bars
his
licenser
for
life.
unfortunately,
luther
miller's
story
is
altogether
too
familiar
in
our
society
today.
a
man
convicted
of
a
felony
prior
to
the
time
he
reached
20
years
of
age,
a
man
who
was
sentenced
to
serve
a
term
in
prison,
and
who
upon
release,
as
an
adult,
finds
himself
faced
with
numerous
occupationally
disabling
requirements.
mr.
robert
masur
no
your
honor.
the
ordinance
would
similar
be
on
constitution.
at
the
early
time,
when
mr.
miller's
need
for
a
job
is
most
acute,
at
the
very
time
when
it
is
most
important
for
him
to
attempt
to
establish
himself
as
a
reputable
member
of
the
society,
he
finds
that
the
collateral
consequences
of
his
conviction
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
find
employment.
such
was
the
case
for
mr.
miller.
nine-and-one-half
years
after
his
conviction
miller
applied
for
a
public
chauffeur's
license
from
the
city
of
chicago.
the
license
was
a
prerequisite
for
a
number
of
common
unskilled
jobs
in
the
city
of
chicago
including
private
bus
drivers,
private
chauffeurs,
and
most
typically
taxicab
drivers.
miller's
application
was
denied
because
the
ordinance
here
at
question
prohibits
a
licenser
for
life
of
anyone
who
was
convicted
of
an
offense
involving
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
no
pardon
from
the
executive
of
the
state
of
illinois.
no
certificate
of
rehabilitation
from
the
court
of
law.
no
conduct
which
mr.
miller
might
engage
in
subsequent
to
his
conviction,
lawful
conduct,
will
in
anyway
remove
that
bar.
mr.
miller's
story
is
therefore
both
typical
and
atypical
in
our
society
today.
it
is
typical
because
there
are
in
fact
numerous
occupational
disqualifications
which
are
applied
to
ex-offenders.
it
is
for
that
reason
the
american
bar
association
filed
its
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
aba
has
generally
banned
leading
a
nationwide
drive
to
remove
the
kind
of
disabling
licenser
requirements
which
is
before
the
court
today.
this
ordinance
is
atypical,
because
it
is
the
most
severe
and
restrictive
ordinance
that
at
least
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
ever
encountered.
mr.
robert
masur
your
honor,
our
argument
does
not
rest
solely
on
whether
or
not
a
licensee
may
keep
his
license
after
conviction.
the
statute,
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
is
irrational.
the
terms
--
mr.
robert
masur
your
honor
we
are
only
here
to
decide
a
single
specific
part
of
the
ordinance,
but
the
ordinance
--
mr.
robert
masur
the
ordinance,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
a
single
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
lifetime
ban
as
to
mr.
miller
for
conviction
of
offense
of
involving
in
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
is
unconstitutional.
for
that
-
mr.
robert
masur
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
robert
masur
no
your
honor
because
--
and
i
intend
to
get
into
it
more
completely
later,
but
the
basic
--
the
fact
is
that
when
you
examine
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
which
i
believe
you
must
and
not
simply
isolate
one
specific
disabling
offense.
one
can
see
as
was
demonstrated
yesterday
that
the
disabling
offense
does
not
serve
rationally
the
purpose
that
the
city
articulates
as
its
only
defense
which
is
to
protect
public
safety.
mr.
robert
masur
there
are
further
classifications
your
honor
because
the
ordinance
is
a
unified
system
and
there
are
people
who
are
subject
to
an
eight
year
ban
on
licenser.
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
misdemeanors
involving
more
turpitude
and
all
other
felonies
other
than
very
select
few.
those
are
the
felonies
who
are
only
subject
to
an
eight
year
ban
include
such
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
murder
by
strangulation
that
is
to
say
not
involving
a
deadly
weapon
(ph).
mr.
robert
masur
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
understanding
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
are
a
number
of
classifications
set
up
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
robert
masur
and
prohibit
the
licenser
of
anybody
who
is
convicted
of
any
offense.
mr.
robert
masur
if
there
were
in
ordinance
before
the
court
which
obviously
is
not.
if
an
ordinance
were
before
the
court
which
involved
simply
saying
anybody
ever
convicted
of
anything,
may
never
get
a
license.
mr.
robert
masur
that
is
right.
it
is
our
position
that
such
an
ordinance
would
also
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
masur
yes,
your
honor
because
that
kind
of
a
disproportionate
treatment
as
between
somebody
who
has
convicted
of
an
offense
15-20
years
ago
and
someone
who
has
never
actually
convicted
of
an
offense.
that
disproportionate
result
that
is
created
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
for
example,
was
--
mr.
robert
masur
we
have
raised
the
issue
your
honor
in
the
trial
court,
but
we
have
not
--
mr.
robert
masur
my
understanding
of
the
case
law
your
honor
is
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
does
not
apply
to
licensing
situations
like
this
although
i
think
that
it
is
in
the
sense
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
robert
masur
in
that
particular
case
perhaps
not
your
honor.
in
james
v.
strange
for
example,
where
the
state
of
kansas
had
a
legitimate
as
recognized
by
the
court,
a
legitimate
interest
in
recouping
money
from
persons
convicted
of
an
offense,
when
the
state
paid
for
their
defense.
nonetheless
this
court
held
despite
their
legitimate
interest
that
the
disproportionality
that
was
involved
there
--
mr.
robert
masur
surely,
there
were
classifications
as
between
those
persons
and
others
who
had
not
been
in
prison.
there
are
classifications
here
too
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
will
be
a
classification
between
all
people.
mr.
robert
masur
the
licensing
scheme
--
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
you
cannot
divorce
the
particular
clause
that
is
before
the
court
from
the
entire
scheme.
the
licensing
scheme
sets
up
a
general
system
to
evaluate
the
character
and
reputation
of
every
single
applicant
for
a
license.
mr.
robert
masur
the
difficulties
that
are
inherent
in
this
licensing
scheme
go
to
the
rationality
of
the
entire
scheme
as
applied
to
this
particular
clause.
the
ordinance
-
and
this
is
chapter
28.1-4
-
provides
that
if
the
commissioner
shall
be
satisfied
that
the
applicant
is
of
good
character
and
reputation
and
is
a
suitable
person
to
be
interested
with
driving
of
public
passenger
vehicle.
he
shall
issue
the
license.
as
part
of
that
decision
that
the
commissioner
must
make
in
every
single
case.
the
commissioner
is
empowered
to
look
into
an
applicant's
employment
history,
his
reputation
in
the
community,
his
physical
qualifications
whatever
the
commissioner
deems
relevant
for
character
and
fitness.
there
is
therefore
an
evaluative
mechanism
to
deal
with
every
single
applicant
except
and
that
is
licensees
and
applicants
alike,
except
as
far
as
mr.
miller
is
concerned
and
the
other
few
people
who
are
barred
for
life
by
this
ordinance.
the
licensing
scheme
here,
established
by
the
chicago
public
chauffeurs
ordinance,
creates
a
crazy
quilt
of
categories
and
disabilities.
similar
or
identical
offenses
are
treated
differently.
past
employment
is
sometimes
relevant
and
sometimes
it
is
not
irrelevant.
character
and
fitness
is
always
relevant
except
one
it
is
not.
that
is
luther
miller
was
convicted
13
years
ago
of
an
offense
involving
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon,
but
a
licensee
who
was
convicted
yesterday
may
retain
his
license.
someone
convicted
of
murder
by
strangulation,
kidnapping
for
ransom,
battery,
may
be
licensed
after
eight
years,
miller
may
never
be
licensed.
and
people
with
drunk
driving
records
have
no
disability
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
masur
people
with
drunk
driving
histories
have
no
presumptive
disability
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
masur
that
is
right.
presumably
every
applicant's
past
history
can
be
evaluated
by
the
commissioner;
that
is
what
makes
this
ordinance
so
irrational.
we
are
not
saying
to
this
court
that
the
commissioner
may
not
consider.
mr.
robert
masur
your
honor
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
robert
masur
this
is
only
in
the
city
of
chicago,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
masur
probably.
mr.
robert
masur
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect
in
the
record
all
i
can
--
mr.
robert
masur
i
do
not
know
your
honor
the
--
the
law
sets
that
this
is
what
is
there
to
do.
mr.
robert
masur
this
case
was
--
mr.
robert
masur
yes,
your
honor.
yesterday
the
issue
that
was
discussed
most
before
the
court
to
see
was
the
issue
as
so
the
distinction
between
licensees
and
applicants,
and
the
court,
the
commissioner
admitted
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
public
chauffeur's
ordinance
was
to
protect
the
public
safety.
at
the
same
time
the
commissioner
admitted
that
the
treatment
of
licensees
had
no
relevance
to
the
question
of
public
safety
and
indeed
that
the
scheme
turns
reality
on
its
head.
that
recent
convictions
become
far
more
relevant
as
to
safety
than
past
convictions.
mr.
robert
masur
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
possession
that
the
irrational
classifications
created
by
this
ordinance
and
that
disproportionate
results
that
followed
from
it,
do
not
in
fact
--
are
not
in
fact
rationally
related
to
the
only
articulated
purpose
for
the
ordinance
which
is
to
protect
the
public
safety.
mr.
robert
masur
no
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
masur
i
think
that
this
ordinance
is
not
rational.
this
ordinance
your
honor,
i
think
is
properly
viewed
within
the
context
of
traditional
offender
disabilities
that
have
been
imposed
upon
people
who
once
committed
a
crime.
traditionally
those
disabilities
grew
out
of
a
societal
desire
to
ostracize
to
continue
to
ostracize,
in
fact
to
prohibit
the
reintegration
of
offenders
into
society
--
mr.
robert
masur
well,
first
of
all
although
there
are
numerous
laws
across
the
country
there
--
mr.
robert
masur
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
that
most
of
those
disability
ordinances
and
statutes
are
nowhere
near
for
years
this
and
in
fact
the
general
trend
in
the
country
is
to
remove
them
or
to
mitigate
mr.
robert
masur
by
legislative
action.
mr.
robert
masur
but
this
ordinance
your
honor
it
is
our
contention
--
mr.
robert
masur
that
this
is
irrational.
take
for
example,
the
commissioner
says
this
is
for
the
public
safety
and
for
the
public
safety
we
must
ban
people
for
life
who
committed
offense
15-20
years
ago.
he
chooses
first
of
all
to
ban
people
convicted
of
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
as
our
brief
establishes,
you
could
be
convicted
of
the
most
minor
misdemeanor
and
fall
within
this
lifetime
ban.
in
addition,
the
lifetime
ban
includes
people
convicted
of
incest,
or
of
the
infamous
crime
against
nature
which
i
believe
is
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
masur
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
because
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
-
we
are
not
asking
the
court
declare
on
constitutional
that
part
of
the
ordinance
which
is
not
before
it
clearly
-
but
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
goes
along
way
in
establishing
whether
or
not
this
is
a
rational
scheme
that
the
city
has
set
up
as
applied
to
my
client
luther
miller,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
examines
the
categories
that
it
establishes
--
mr.
robert
masur
not
simply
that
your
honor,
i
agree.
however,
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
masur
the
fact
that
these
offenses
are
included
in
a
lifetime
ban
is
an
indication
that
what
was
motivating
the
city
council,
the
intent
behind
this
ordinance
is
not
as
the
commissioner
has
argued
before
this
court,
but
that
there
was
some
attempt
to
pick
out
to
choose
those
offenses
which
the
city
council
was
morally
upset
by
and
to
ostracize
those
people
for
life.
in
that
sense
the
inclusion
of
the
armed
robbery
or
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
within
that
fall
--
it
some
indication
that
in
fact
this
is
not
at
all
necessary
as
they
indicate
to
protect
the
public
safety.
in
addition,
mr.
justice
stevens
the
city
has
the
evaluative
mechanism
for
every
single
applicant
to
determine.
mr.
robert
masur
not
in
and
of
itself,
but
the
mixed
motivation
has
led
to
in
ordinance
which
does
not
in
fact
rationally
further
the
goals
which
they
have
established.
it
is
also
disproportionate
mr.
justice
stevens
in
the
sense
that
they
have
chosen
certain
crimes
and
there
is
a
lifetime
bar.
in
fact,
the
city
in
its
opening
brief
on
page
28
says
something
to
the
effect
that
admittedly
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
five
year
ban
or
a
ten
year
ban
or
a
lifetime
ban
is
somewhat
arbitrary
and
those
are
the
commissioner's
words.
well,
if
it
were
a
five
year
ban
or
a
ten
year
ban
mr.
miller
would
now
be
eligible
for
a
license.
mr.
robert
masur
no
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
robert
masur
no
your
honor,
what
--
mr.
robert
masur
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
by
looking
at
the
ordinance
as
a
whole,
one
can
ascertain
that
in
fact
this
ordinance
was
not
established
for
the
sole
purpose
which
they
have,
the
commissioner
has
articulated
today.
that
as
a
general
licensing
scheme
it
is
irrational.
as
to
all
other
licensing
provisions
in
the
city
of
chicago
they
simply
rely
on
character
and
fitness.
mr.
robert
masur
well,
it
is
true
yes.
mr.
robert
masur
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
burden
--
mr.
robert
masur
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
of
course
the
city
has
ignored
all
of
the
other
provisions
in
the
ordinance
other
than
the
immediate
one
before
and
that
is
in
my
opinion
because
--
mr.
robert
masur
i
believe
that
the
city
in
coming
before
to
the
court
and
saying
to
the
court
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance
is
public
safety
is
required
to
come
to
the
court
and
say
the
position
of
mr.
miller
within
that
scheme
is
irrational.
he
is
being
irrationally
treated
as
related
to
all
other
people
that
this
is
the
sole
purpose
of
the
ordinance
public
safety.
it
is
proper
therefore
--
mr.
robert
masur
i
do
not
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
masur
mr.
chief
justice
are
you
saying
if
only
armed
robbers
cannot
get
a
license
and
everybody
else
was
eligible
for
a
license
would
it
be
rational?
no,
i
believe
it
would
not
be
,rational
because
the
city
council
would
be
in
the
position
of
setting
out
one
group
of
persons
a
classification
and
treating
them
radically
differently
from
all
other
identically,
or
similarly
situated
people
and
not
just
that
the
treatment
is
different
but
there
is
the
disproportionality
of
the
treatment
is
so
great.
on
the
one
hand
somebody
is
eligible
immediately
for
licenser
and
on
the
other
hand
miller
is
barred
for
life.
mr.
robert
masur
as
i
understand
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
robert
masur
and
if
the
classifications
are
not
rational?
mr.
robert
masur
well,
perhaps
we
chose
a
wrong
route.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
invidiously
discriminatory
as
well
mr.
justice
stewart
to
set
up
with
licensing
scheme
that
looked
like
that.
say,
as
i
indicated
before
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
to
the
history
of
discrimination
that
has
been
opposed
on
ex-offenders.
ex-offenders,
as
a
group,
are
people
who
have
no
political
power
indeed
to
until
very
recently
in
most
states
they
were
denied
the
right
to
vote.
because
they
are
in
that
position
they
are
subject
to
this
kind
of
an
ordinance
which
allows
a
city
to
say
to
a
person,
if
you
have
done
something
once
the
rest
of
your
life
is
meaningless
in
terms
at
least
of
seeking
employment
through
any
licensing
agency,
the
city
of
chicago.
i
think
that
is
important
therefore
that
court
look
to
carefully
at
the
ordinance
and
not
simply
to
see
whether
there
is
a
line
that
somehow
might
be
acceptable
here.
the
ordinance,
as
the
aba
points
out
and
as
presidential
commissions
have
pointed
out,
is
contrary
to
good
public
policy.
most
states
or
many
states
including
illinois
have
rejected
the
presumptions
behind
this
kind
of
an
inordinance
and
illinois
all
licensing
schemes
provide
that
a
conviction
may
be
taken
into
account
which
we
have
never
denied
here,
but
they
may
not
in
and
of
themselves
to
be
presumptive
bars.
the
city
of
chicago
for
all
purposes,
except
this
ordinance
and
one
or
two
others,
does
exactly
the
same.
to
deny
a
person
the
right
to
seek
employment,
which
is
after
all
is
not
a
fundamental
right
under
this
court's
holding,
certainly
a
very
important
right.
it
is
certainly
unwise
and
in
fact,
in
our
opinion,
unjust.
i
believe
that
there
is
substantial
precedent
from
this
court
to
establish
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
ordinance.
this
is,
the
ordinance
is
in
sum,
is
disproportionate
in
the
sense
the
james
v.
strange
was.
schware
versus
the
board
of
bar
examiners
establishes
that
in
order
to
consider
somebody
for
a
license,
in
that
case
it
was
bar
license,
one
must
look
at
their
present
fitness
for
a
licenser.
mr.
robert
masur
it
was
decided
under
the
due
process
clause
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
in
re
griffiths
which
was
an
equal
protection
case
that
court
cited
and
relied
upon
schware
and
again
condemned
undifferentiated
bars
to
employment.
i
believe
the
ordinance
here
before
the
court
is
unconstitutional
that
indeed
without
wishing
to
engage
in
a
hyperbole
that
it
is
contrary
to
many
of
the
notions
which
govern
our
society.
which
is
to
say
that
an
individual
ought
to
have
the
right
and
the
opportunity
to
seek
to
improve
and
to
advance
himself,
and
that
to
hold
against
him
because
of
a
serious
mistake
which
he
made
as
a
youth,
or
as
a
young
man.
it
is
contrary
to
the
notions
upon
which
we
generally
govern
ourselves.
mr.
robert
masur
no,
your
honor.
the
commissioner
suggests
two
justifications
for
that
distinction
between
licensees
and
applicants.
one
of
them
as
a
track
record
and
so
you
point
out
a
licensee
may
not
in
fact
have
a
track
record
at
all.
indeed
the
irony
is
that
the
licensee,
even
if
he
has
a
track
record
here
is
a
person
who
commits
a
crime
while
he
is
a
licensee.
in
addition,
the
track
record
argument
does
not
deal
with
the
fact
that
an
applicant
may
have
an
employment
history
not
driving
a
cab
generally,
but
equally
longer,
longer
than
the
cab
driver
and
finally,
even
if
and
this
turns
more
to
his
argument
that
essentially
there
is
an
interest
involved.
even
if
the
licensee
has
more
of
an
interest
in
taking
and
keeping
his
license
than
the
applicant
does
in
getting
it.
there
is
no
justification
there
in
case
law
for
imposing
differential
standards
as
between
licensees
and
applicants,
and
indeed
even
if
the
interest
is
there,
the
disproportionate
results
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
licensee
is
just
committed
a
crime
and
my
client
committed
a
crime
13
years
ago,
the
disproportionate
result
makes
it
irrational.
mr.
robert
masur
thank
you
very
much.
