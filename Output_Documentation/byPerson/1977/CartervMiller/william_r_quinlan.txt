mr.
william
r.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorarai
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
involves
review
as
two
primary
issues.
the
first
being
is
in
ordinance
that
conclusively
denies
issuance
of
a
public
chauffeurs'
license
to
an
applicant
convicted
of
a
crime,
involving
use
of
a
deadly
weapon,
violative
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
revocation
of
a
present
licensee's
previously
granted
license
is
discretionary
after
a
hearing
rather
than
mandatory.
secondly,
whether
the
ordinance
violets
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
an
applicant
is
presumed
unfit
for
licenser
after
he
has
been
convicted
of
an
offense
involving
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
primary
that
the
respondent
miller
submitted
an
application
to
petitioner
carter
who
is
the
chicago
public
vehicle
commissioner
for
a
taxicab
driver's
license.
he
takes
public
chauffeurs'
license,
but
primarily
it
is
used
for
a
taxicab
driver's.
in
the
application
mr.
miller
acknowledged
in
response
to
a
question
on
the
application
form
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
armed
robbery.
the
commissioner
said
in
the
applicable
municipal
ordinance,
which
prohibits
the
issuance
of
a
cab
driver's
license
to
an
applicant
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon,
refused
mr.
miller
a
license.
thereafter
respondent
miller
filed
the
instant
section
1983
action
alleging
violations
of
fifth,
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
seeking
declaratory
injunctive
relief.
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
was
dismissed.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
this
court
granted
commissioner
carter's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
ordinance
results
in
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
it
discriminated
irrationally
among
classes
of
ex-offenders.
the
court
declared
that
an
applicant
for
a
license
who
has
committed
one
of
the
described
felonies
and
a
licensee
who
has
done
the
same
are
similarly
situated
and
no
justification
exists
for
automatically
disqualifying
one
and
not
the
other.
this
is
basically
the
issue
that
we
dispute
that
was
being
found
contrary
to
our
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
initially,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
observe
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
primarily
an
equal
protection
case.
it
involves
the
traditional
equal
protection
test
which
should
be
applied
to
an
ordinance
or
any
kind
of
statutory
legislation
of
this
nature.
there
is
no
strict
scrutiny
test
should
be
applied
in
this
instance.
we
do
not
yet
have
a
suspect
classification.
this
court
has
never
ruled
the
ex-offenders
following
to
the
category
of
suspect
classification,
nor
is
there
a
fundamental
right,
in
our
opinion,
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
again
the
court
while
it
has
ruled
that
the
right
to
work
is
an
important
right,
it
has
never
ruled
that
the
right
to
work
is
a
fundamental
right.
furthermore,
we
believe
it
is
important
also
to
stress
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
something
that
i
think
both
the
court
below
and
the
respondent
has
basically
agreed
that
the
consideration
of
a
criminal
conviction
is
rationally
related
to
the
goal
attempting
to
be
achieved
by
the
city
council
that
is
primarily
the
protection
of
the
taxicab
passenger
and
that
this
is
a
legitimate
consideration.
the
dispute
resolves
around
the
issue
whether
or
not
this
ex-offender
who
is
disqualified
by
reason
of
being
an
applicant
automatically,
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
when
that
same
type
of
individual
is
not
automatically
disqualified
if
in
fact
he
is
already
a
licensee.
we
think
that
there
are
primary
two
factors
which
differentiate
the
circumstances
of
applicants
and
licensees,
which
justify
the
disparity
and
treatment
of
applicants
and
licensees.
first,
a
current
licensee
has
a
career
stake,
a
property
interest
in
this
employment
which
may
not
be
terminated
except
after
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
i
would
not
say
so
your
honor.
what
you
are
really
saying
in
this
instance
is
that
that
is
a
legitimate
classification
because
there
is
a
rational
reason
for
the
classification.
i
did
attempt
to
point
out
as
i
said
earlier
that
i
do
think
that
the
ordinance
itself
is
rationally
related
to
the
goal
of
protecting
the
taxicab
passenger
and
providing
for
public
safety
that
i
think
the
court
below
agreed
was
a
rationally
related
purpose.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
am
not
sure
i
am
following
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
correct
and
i
am
submitting
there
is
another
justification
for
that.
in
that
they
are
in
a
different
category
in
the
sense
that
they
possess
different
rights
namely
that
the
individual
who
is
already
licensed
now
sets
something
at
stake
namely
his
career,
his
employment.
the
right
to
have
that
license
can
deprive
him
of
his
opportunity
for
employment.
i
think
this
court
in
bell
versus
burson
suggested
the
same
thing
when
it
indicated
that
the
denial
of
the
license
there
on
the
basis
of
the
allegation
that
he
may
or
may
not
have
been
liable
merely
because
he
was
in
an
automobile
accident,
he
did
not
put
up
the
appropriate
insurance,
would
also
indicate
that
once
you
should
have
the
license,
your
status
changes.
we
are
submitting
that
that
is
the
situation
here
that
the
status
of
the
two
individuals
have
in
fact
where
the
two
categories
are
different
and
have
changed
once
the
license
has
been
issued,
so
to
take
the
license,
we
must
employ
additional
procedural
steps
rather
than
in
denying
the
license.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
think
the
board
of
regents
v.
roth
and
perry
v.
sindermann
indicate
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
problem
of
property
right
or
some
sorts
of
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
at
the
moment
i
cannot
honestly
think
of
a
specific
case
which
so
holds.
i
think
though
from
the
reading
of
the
cases
in
the
generic
area,
this
can
be
implied
in
determining
what
is
the
stake
at
interest
here
to
be
preserved,
and
i
think
that
quite
clearly
if
you
are
in
the
profession
there
is
a
greater
stake
at
issue
than
if
you
are
not
in
the
profession.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
what
good
the
hearing
to
this
man?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
they
have
indicated
that
the
court
below
did
not
feel
that
any
hearing
whatsoever
would
be
of
any
benefit
to
the
individual.
however,
a
hearing
is
provided
both
for
denial
of
a
license
for
applicants,
as
well
as
a
denial
of
a
license
for
a
existing
licensee.
what
could
be
determined
on
a
hearing
would
be
whether
or
not
he
was
not
in
fact
the
individual
for
one
purpose.
whether
in
fact
he
was
convicted
of
that
crime,
whether
in
fact
perhaps
that
conviction
was
reversed
on
appeal?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
all
he
said
he
was
convicted
of
armed
robbery.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
as
i
am
saying
it
would
none
of
the
circumstance
in
this
case,
i
think
you
are
quite
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
in
this
case
this
particular
individual,
i
think
you
are
absolutely
correct
because
he
has
admitted
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
armed
robbery
does
not
challenge
that,
does
not
suggest
that
he
was
not
the
individual
that
was
reversed
to
anything
of
that
nature.
i
was
suggesting
as
a
hypothetical
instance,
there
would
possibly
be
some
purpose
for
going
through
with
the
hearing.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
think
that
question
really
has
two
sub-issues
to
it:
the
first
that
i
would
address
is
that
what
you
are
basically
saying,
is
that
perhaps
in
a
situation
of
licensed
drivers,
the
consideration
of
a
conviction
that
occurred
more
recently
as
opposed
to
one
that
occurred
some
time
ago,
would
be
a
portent
consideration.
i
would
consider
that
within
the
classification
first
namely,
he
is
a
licensed
driver.
the
second
suggestion
you
are
making
is
whether
or
not
there
is
the
difference
between
a
conviction
at
the
present
time,
for
a
licensed
driver,
and
one
for
one
who
is
non-licensed
at
all
and
as
i
would
indicate,
i
think
that
the
standard
is
different
in
judging
the
licensed
driver,
the
test
is
much
more
strict,
and
second
of
all
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
a
judgment
that
would
have
to
be
determined
by
the
hearing
officer
in
terms
of
dealing
with
licensed
taxicab
drivers,
and
he
would
have
to
make
the
individual
judgment.
the
other
judgment
has
been
made
by
the
legislative
body.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
would
address
that
by
saying
that
that
primarily
is
a
determination
for
legislative
body
in
enacting
a
provision
which
provides
qualification
to
obtain
a
license.
they
have
made
a
legislative
determination
that
one
who
has
been
convicted
of
an
offense,
involving
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
should
not
receive
a
taxicab
license.
we
would
then
submit
that
the
test
that
has
to
applied
to
that
is
a
traditional
equal
protection
test,
is
that
rationally
related
to
the
goal
namely
protecting
the
taxicab
passenger,
if
that
is
true
then
it
meets
that
test
and
we
would
submit
that
does
meet
that
test.
now,
the
next
step
is
going
back
to
the
same
argument,
we
have
provided
greater
rights
for
the
cases
of
licensees
and
it
really
does
not
directly
relate
as
to
whether
it
was
more
recent
or
less
recent,
the
conviction
i
would
think
under
those
terms.
however,
this
would
be
a
consideration
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
i
am
sure
that
if
in
the
circumstances
surrounding,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
mandated
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
unless
we
get
into
the
next
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
be
dealing
with
the
issue
of
whether
this
voilates
due
process
which
is
the
second
question
and
whether
we
should
be
applying
the
substantive
due
process
doctrine
to
legislative
enactments,
and
i
think
that
is
always
a
possibility,
but
then
as
this
court
has
recognized,
it
is
extremely
fraught
with
dangers.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
approach
to
the
equal
protection
is,
would
be
basically,
or
based
primarily
and
whether
or
not
this
was
a
ligitimit
governmental
interest
namely,
the
protection
of
the
safety
of
the
traveling
public.
we
would
submit
that
it
is.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
as
opposed
to
one
who
has
the
license.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
think
we
and
the
legislative
body
would
conquer
with
that.
all
i
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well
we
are
not
suggesting
that
we
do
not,
we
are
suggesting
that
a
different
procedure
is
applied
to
the
individual
who
has
a
license
on
the
basis
that
he
has
more
of
a
stake
in
that
license,
after
having
received
his
career
is
at
stake.
he
does
have
a
license;
he
is
earning
a
living
by
use
of
that
license.
that
is
not
true
with
the
applicant
and
that
his
interest
or
stake
is
less,
therefore
his
due
process
rights
are
less.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
in
this
type
of
situation,
i
personally
involve
one
another
case
which
was
not
appealed.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
would
not
assume
so;
i
would
assume
those
who
did
have
this
conviction
or
this
problem
would
not
apply
being
aware
of
what
the
ordinance
provided,
been
an
absolute
prohibition.
i
do
--
as
we
indicated
primarily
we
thought
that
the
bell
versus
burson
case
where
the
court
had
said,
once
a
licence
is
issued,
there
was
continuing
possession
may
become
essential
pursuit
or
a
livelihood
indicate
or
basis
for
this
distinction.
it
seems
clear
that
the
principle
must
apply
with
even
greater
force
than
the
taxicab
driver
which
is
inevitably
related
to
the
driver's
livelihood.
we
indicated
before
the
interest
and
rights
of
the
applicant
are
very
different
than
those
of
the
individual
who
has
received
his
license.
also
another
factor
that
is
relevant
in
terms
of
considering
the
difference
between
the
two
individuals
is
that
the
incumbent
licensees
have
a
work
record
which
is
an
indication
of
their
fitness.
the
applicants,
they
have
no
such
record
and
the
commissioner
would
be
compelled
in
their
case
to
predict
reliability
or
rehabilitation
based
upon
whatever
they
might
be
inclined
to
present.
we
are
not
submitting
that
this
is
administrative
convenience,
it
is
rather
based
on
the
city
council's
conclusion
that
is
impossible
to
make
the
type
of
evaluations
which
you
are
hearing
on
a
question
of
rehabilitation
in
terms
of
one
who
had
been
convicted
previously
would
require.
it
is
simply
felt
that
such
judgment
would
necessarily
be
speculative
for
the
reason
that
the
techniques
for
such
evaluations
are
not
available.
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
legislature
may
make
classifications
that
in
doing
so
do
not
file
equal
protection
clause.
in
marshall
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
upheld
a
statute
which
conclusively
denied
a
convict
of
narcotics
act
access
to
rehabilitative
commitment
if
he
had
two
or
more
felonies.
there
the
court
said
--
the
court
has
frequently
noted
the
legislative
classifications
need
not
to
be
perfect
or
ideal
in
the
line
drawn
by
congress
at
two
felonies,
for
example,
might
with
his
much
soundness
have
been
drawn
at
one,
but
the
court
had
cut
them
off
exclusively
there
at
two,
and
this
is
a
similar
type
of
situation
on
legislative
judgment.
they
are
drawing
a
line
and
cutting
them
off
conclusively.
it
is
not
something
that
is
unique,
it
occurs
in
many
other
instances.
we
believe
the
procedures
applied
on
the
chicago
ordinance
do
not
resolve
the
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
respondent's
contention
that
all
the
applicant
should
be
giving
a
hearing
would
perhaps
result
in
some
ex-offenders,
applicants
gaining
a
license,
but
again
it
is
not
every
situation
that
the
legislative
body
must
address
itself
to.
we
feel
that
the
dandridge
case
indicated
quite
clearly
that
a
legislative
body
could
one
step
at
the
time
to
deal
with
those
particular
types
of
problems
that
it
felt
was
necessary
to
deal
with
and
it
did
not
have
to
deal
with
each
situation.
furthermore,
that
while
the
ordinance
does
not
apply
to
other
types
of
occupational
licensee,
this
we
do
not
feel
is,
or
requires
this
to
be
held
as
violates
with
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
basis
for
that
is
primarily
that
again
the
legislative
body
has
chosen
to
select
out
this
area
and
felt
that
this
particular
type
of
problem
was
more
dangerous
to
the
traveling
public.
in
a
taxicab
type
of
situation
the
traveling
public
is
particularly
and
uniquely
uniformed
in
selecting
the
cab.
they
are
also
in
a
mobile
influent
type
of
situation.
there
is
no
supervision
in
that
type
of
situation,
and
accordingly
to
select
this
out
and
not
to
use
it
in
other
type
of
instance,
say,
in
food/beverage
(ph)
license
and
things
of
that
nature
is
not
on
unreasonable
distinction
for
the
legislative
body
to
draw
out.
it
is
reasonable
that
they
would
select
that
type
of
procedure
and
that
they
would
employ
this
type
of
doctrine
in
that
instance.
the
respondents
have
suggested
that
this
constitutes
an
irrebuttable
presumption
and
accordingly,
it
is
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
would
submit
that
in
trying
to
apply
this
type
of
principle
namely
the
irrebuttable
presumption
that
it
is
a
type
of
situation
that
occurs
in
any
instance
with
the
legislative
body
draws
a
line
and
make
some
sort
of
classification,
it
can
always
be
argued
that
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
and
accordingly
violative
of
the
due
process.
we
would
submit
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
due
process,
or
irrebuttable
presumption
involving
due
process.
the
reasons
for
this,
we
would
submit,
that
indications
in
which
irrebuttable
presumption
has
been
employed,
in
most
instances
the
two
fold
occurrences
have
taken
place.
one
is
either
that
the
particular
fact
was
never
established
in
any
type
of
a
due
process
procedure.
it
is
merely
an
alleged
fact.
two
-
that
the
fact
itself
was
not
necessarily
related
to
the
goal
that
was
trying
to
be
protected.
in
this
instance
we
would
submit
that
when
we
are
talking
about
a
conviction,
the
best
use
of
the
due
process
procedure
has
been
employed
namely
the
trial
system
before
a
court
of
law.
the
determination
has
been
made,
the
conviction
has
taken
place.
there
we
are
not
talking
about
a
fact
that
may
or
not
be
true
or
an
allegation
and
the
schware
case,
there
was
a
situation
where
there
was
several
alleged
facts
namely
arrests,
there
was
the
use
of
aliases
and
the
membership
in
the
communist
party.
all
three
of
these
were
set
forth
as
a
basis
for
denying
the
fitness
of
the
applicant
to
receive
a
license
to
practice
law.
in
none
of
those
incidences,
namely
in
a
case
of
arrest,
was
there
any
determination
that
this
was
in
fact
the
case.
the
arrests
were
never
processed
any
further
and
no
conviction
was
obtained;
it
was
merely
an
allegation.
the
membership
in
the
communist
party
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
this
applicant
was
fit
to
practice
law,
was
not
rationally
related,
the
aliases
were
used
with
a
purpose
because
he
was
a
jewish
member
of
society,
he
was
active
in
italian
labor
unions
and
there
was
no
indication
that
any
of
these
were
rationally
related.
finally
we
would
submit
again
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
stake
or
the
interest
of
the
party
has
in
receiving
protection,
and
an
individual
who
has
not
received
a
license
does
not
have
the
same
degree
of
stake
or
interest
in
that
particular
license
at
that
moment,
and
accordingly,
those
factors
would
indicate
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
instance
in
which
to
apply
the
due
process
doctrine
of
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
it
is
distinguishable
on
the
facts
even
it
involves
an
ambulance
driver
your
honor
and
an
ambulance
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
he
had
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
and
then
the
ordinance
was
subsequently
amended
to
apply
to
ambulance
driver,
and
then
he
went
to
apply
for
a
relicensing
at
that
time
he
was
turned
down
on
the
basis
of
this
provision
in
28.1-3.
he
then
went
into
court
challenging
the
ordinance,
the
court
held
that
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him.
there
is
clearly
language
in
that
opinion
which
suggests
that
the
prohibition
on
anyone
who
has
been
convicted
of
offense
with
a
deadly
weapon
was
irrational
and
did
not,
and
was
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
the
court
did
hold
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him.
we
would
submit
the
unique
facts
there
clearly
indicate
that
the
case
should
be
limited
to
just
those
facts.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
reappled.
that
is
correct
and
that
it
should
be
limited
to
just
those
facts
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
them.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
it
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
just
a
few
comments
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
of
yesterday
and
today
with
the
differential
treatment,
it
is
our
feeling
that
there
has
been
some
misconception
in
what
the
burden
of
the
city
is
here
and
primarily
who
has
the
burden.
i
think
we
would
all
agree
if
we
are
talking
about
equal
protection,
then
the
burden
is
primarily
not
that
of
the
legislative
body
or
the
city
in
establishing
justification
for
the
classification.
it
is
presumed
to
be
well.
and
then
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
really
is
any
justification
for
treating
the
two
classifications
or
two
parties
differently,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
basis
for
treating
them
differently
and
that
primarily
is
because
one
has
status
of
being
on
the
job
or
having
a
license
and
has
a
greater
interest
and
that
must
be
considered
in
terms
of
this
court's
ruling
in
roth
and
sinderman.
in
terms
of
making
sure
that
it
is
arbitrarily
deprived
and
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
they
are
titled
to
more
rights
and
more
consideration,
this
has
been
traditionally
the
case
of
all
instances
in
dealing
with
individuals
who
have
employment
and
individuals
who
do
not
have
employment
that
their
right
that
is
the
right
to
the
individual
on
the
job
are
greater
than
the
right
to
the
individual
not
on
the
job.
that
does
not
suggest
that
they
can
be
arbitrarily
dealt
with
but
they
are
dealt
with
differently
and
we
are
submitting
that
the
test
for
the
burden
of
the
city
is
not
to
demonstrate,
there
is
not
invidious
discrimination,
and
that
there
is
a
rational
relationship,
and
that
this
is
conclusively
related
to
public
safety.
but
our
burden
is
really
to
show
that
there
is
some
reason
for
treating
the
classes
differently
and
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
there
is
no
reason,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
reason
for
treating
the
parties
differently
and
what
we
have
here
also
is
a
two-tier
problem.
the
first
problem
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable
to
treat
people
who
are
convicted
of
a
crime
dealing
with
a
weapon
differently
than
others.
we
submit
it
is
related
to
the
goal
of
protecting
the
traveling
public
in
cabs.
that
has
been
accepted
by
the
court
below
and
we
think
it
is
rational
to
submit
that
that
is
related
to
it.
secondly,
is
there
any
basis
for
treating
licensees
that
is
incumbents
and
applicants
differently?
we
submit
yes,
that
the
rights
in
the
interest
at
stake
are
different
and
that
in
the
case
of
incumbents
or
licensees
roth,
sinderman
require
that
they
would
be
given
further
right
and
further
benefits
than
do
applicants
or
applicants
entitled
to
receive.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
i
say
that
is
the
goal
to
be
achieved
by
this
as
to
safety
for
the
traveling
of
public,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
for
the
particular
classification?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
that
would
be
the
reason
for
the
classification
that
is
the
justification
for
it.
it
also
applies
to
narcotics
as
well
as
the
others.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
and
incests,
i
agree,
not
incests
primarily
--
but
the
reason
for
that
is
that
is
a
peculiar
problem
with
cab
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
might
be
unique
situation
yes
sir.
thank
you.
