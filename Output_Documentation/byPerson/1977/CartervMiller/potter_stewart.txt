the
court
in
this
case
considered
the
res
judicata
effect
of
that
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
decision
brought
to
the
court's
attention?
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
read
the
implications
of
this
question.
so
far
as
the
equal
protection
clause
goes
if
there
are
no
more
classifications
then
there
cannot
be
invidious
classification
and
then
your
equal
protection
clause
argument
would
fail
if
chicago
treated
of
both
of
these
classifications
identically,
i.e.
applicants
for
licenses
and
those
who
already
have
licenses.
anybody
convicted
of
an
offense
involving
a
gun
is
disqualified
from
a
license
then
there
would
be
no
further
classification.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
chicago
treated
both
licensees
and
applicants
precisely
the
same
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
a
disability
an
offense
involving
a
gun,
or
those
disabilities
involving
an
eight
year
ban,
or
whatever
there
would
be
no
more
classifications
for
you
to
complain
about,
would
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
chicago
obliterated
all
of
them
and
just
treated
both
applicants
and
licensees
identically
--
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
they
want
to
do
as
long
as
they
do
not
create
any
differences,
any
distinctions
between
applicants
and
the
licensees.
justice
potter
stewart
and
any
licensee
who
was
convicted
of
anything
looses
his
license?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
classifications
in
that
case
we
think,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
justice
rehnquist's
question
was:
if
you
prevail
on
your
equal
protection
clause
claim,
couldn't
chicago
immediately
solve
its
constitutional
defect
by
simply
treating
licensees
the
same
as
applicants
and
your
answer
is
no,
i
do
not
understand
why
you
say
no,
but
i
understand
that
your
answer
is
no,
it
could
not?
so
i
do
not
take
any
more
of
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
your
contention
therefore
is
that
the
city
council
of
chicago
which
is
a
body
that
enacted
this
ordinance
really,
are
not
crazy?
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
our
law
is
full
of
examples
in
every
state
of
the
union
i
would
be
almost
certain
and
very
perhaps
very,
very
unwisely
as
you
and
the
aba
and
others
say,
but
like
the
wisdom
does
not
mean
unconstitutionally.
justice
potter
stewart
all
sorts
of
disabilities
imposed
upon
convicted
felonies.
justice
potter
stewart
by
legislative
action.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
that
is
very,
very
wise
as
you
say,
but
that
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
constitutionality,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
now
you
say
would
it
be
rational,
does
that?
it
has
nothing
to
do
with,
does
it
with
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
the
equal
protection
clause
has
much
to
do
with
rationality,
does
it
has
to
do
with
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
if
they
are
invidiously
discriminatory.
rationality,
as
a
criteria
in
a
constitutionality,
would
have
about
40
years
ago,
i
thought,
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
protection
for
this?
