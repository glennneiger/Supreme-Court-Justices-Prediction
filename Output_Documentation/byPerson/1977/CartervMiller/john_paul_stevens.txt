does
that
factor
have
anything
to
do
with
the
justification
for
the
ordinance
namely
the
protection
of
the
passenger?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
quite
the
same
the
saying
that
the
discrimination
or
the
classification
is
rationally
related
to
the
justification
for
the
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
understand
you
to
say
is
there
is
a
reason
for
a
rule
which
protects
the
passenger
from
a
driver
who
may
have
been
guilty
of
an
armed
robbery,
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
differentiating
between
two
drivers,
both
of
whom
are
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
one
of
whom
had
a
prior
license,
one
who
did
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
cases
holding
that
you
can
have
different
standards
of
eligibility
for
a
position
for
a
lawyer,
or
doctor,
or
something
like
that
depending
on
whether
you
are
already
in
the
profession
or
merely
seeking
to
get
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
quinlan,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
in
terms
of
the
justification
for
the
ordinance,
namely
the
safety
of
the
passenger
-
could
not
one
reasonably
conclude
that
the
driver
who
has
more
recently
committed
an
offense,
poses
a
greater
threat
to
the
safety
of
the
passenger
than
one
who
committed
an
offense
many
years
ago
and
that
the
conviction
by
an
existing
driver
therefore
poses
a
greater
threat
to
safety
than
one
of
the
offender
eight,
or
ten
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
that
--
but
the
thought
was
running
through
my
mind
is
it
conceivably
to
the
extent
that
the
distinction
between
the
old
offender
and
the
recent
offender
is
relevant.
the
recent
offender
is
the
more
dangerous
of
the
two,
and
therefore
he
is
the
one
who
should
be
automatically
excluded
to
protect
the
passenger
rather
than
the
other
one.
so
i
wonder
if
your
classification
is
not
perverse
in
terms
of
the
reason
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
quinlan
can
i
ask
you
one
another
question
about
roth
against
dailey
(ph)
the
illinois
case
which
has
applied
to
the
litigant
in
that
case
held
the
last
sentence
of
this
section
invalid.
what
is
this?
would
that
case
be
distinguishable
from
this
one
on
its
facts?
and
if
not
what
is
the
status
of
the
ordinance,
why
it
may
be
just
sued
in
the
wrong
form,
is
that
the
problem
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
was
that
case
and
the
appellant
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
on
unconstitutional
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
masur
i
just
have
pursued
justice
rehnquist's
question
before,
do
you
really
have
standing
to
complain
about
other
people
who
are
included
in
the
ordinance
who
committed
less
serious
offenses
than
your
client
did,
now
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
whether
the
ordinance
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
one
who
committed
armed
robbery.
is
that
therefore
relevant
to
ask
about
people
who
may
have
been
convicted
of
unlawful
possession
of
hunting
knife
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
say,
we
are
with
you
that
it
is
irrational
to
include
incest,
would
that
entitle
your
client
to
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
say,
we
agree
as
irrational
to
include
misdemeanors
involving
in
deadly
weapon.
would
that
entitle
your
client
to
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
could
have
done
a
better
job.
that
is
true,
but
soon
they
have
mixed
motive.
soon
some
members
of
the
council
thought
they
really
ought
to
punish
people
if
they
have
done
anything
wrong
in
society
so
they
do
not
let
them
to
drive
a
cab,
but
some
members
of
the
council
thought
there
is
also
a
safety
problem
herein.
people
who
have
committed
armed
robbery
do
impose
a
greater
threat
to
the
safety
of
passengers
than
others
do.
would
the
mix
motivation
deprive
the
ordinance
of
rationality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
masur
may
i
ask
you
two
questions:
first,
you
attacked
to
classification
for
licensees
and
applicants
on
the
ground
that
the
justification
for
the
ordinance
does
not
justify
that
classification.
well,
perhaps
the
classification
could
be
justified
by
some
other
consideration
generally,
your
opponent
argues
that
the
right
to
the
job
should
be
more
respected
in
the
case
of
one
who
has
the
job
than
one
who
is
merely
seeking
the
job.
what
do
you
say
about
the
validity
of
that
general
justification
for
this
kind
of
distinction?
i
think
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
supported
by
case
law
except
to
the
extent
of
hearings
were
provided
in
roth
and
so
forth.
well,
you
have
not
really
attacked
the
classification
in
general
terms
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
does
not
relate
specifically
to
the
justifications
for
this
ordinance.
do
you
accept
the
validity
of
this
distinction
otherwise
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question
perhaps
i
should
not
ask
you,
is
luther
miller
in
this
case
the
same
as
in
miller
against
tumney
(ph).
