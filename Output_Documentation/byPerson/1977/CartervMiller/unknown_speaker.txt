unknown
speaker
that
goes
to
the
questione
with
the
entire
hearing,
but
the
question
i
am
asking
is
as
to
the
substantive
rules
that
define
eligibility
for
the
license
or
the
profession
whatever,
are
there
any
case
is
holding
that
the
distinction
you
present
in
this
ordinance
is
a
proper
distinction.
then
you
have
different
rules
for
people
who
are
in
the
business
and
for
those
who
seek
to
get
in.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
you
draw
a
line
that
if
somebody
already
has
a
license
and
somebody
does
not
have,
but
one,
you
get
a
hearing
and
other
you
do
not.
well,
i
do
not
see
any
difference
into
getting
a
hearing
doing
any
good.
unknown
speaker
i
should
not
have
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
definition
of
lunacy
as
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
