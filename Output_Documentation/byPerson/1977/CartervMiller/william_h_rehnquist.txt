justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
arguments
were
sustained
i
suppose
the
city
of
chicago
could
revert
to
a
policy
of
automatically
revoking
licenses
on
the
basis
of
conviction
of
a
felony
for
those
who
already
have
them
as
well
as
denying
them
and
without
bilaterally
equal
protection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
an
ordinance
as
a
whole
is
irrational?
is
that
what
we
are
here
to
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
what
provision
of
constitution
do
you
say,
we
are
empowered
to
decide
that
it
is
irrational?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause
were
sustained,
couldn't
that
be
cured
by
simply
making
exactly
the
same
ban
applicable
to
those
who
already
have
licenses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
your
client
can
raise
difficulties
which
you
conceive
to
be
inherent
in
the
licensing
scheme
which
did
not
affect
the
denial
of
the
license
to
him?
