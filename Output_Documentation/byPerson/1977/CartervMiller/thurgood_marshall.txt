justice
thurgood
marshall
what
good
with
the
hearing
to
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
filled
out
a
blank
and
said
all
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
enough.
what
is
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
if
a
man
had
been
sentenced
for
armed
robbery
and
sentenced
for
20
years
and
served
five
and
had
a
license
you
would
not
take
away
from
him,
but
from
another
armed
robber
who
was
arrested
and
tried
and
convicted
and
the
judge
suspended
the
sentence
and
said,
what
a
great
man
he
was.
and
nobody
could
change
that,
but
the
legislature,
i
do
not
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
there
yet,
i
have
not
gotten
to
equal
protection
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
that
it
would
protect
the
public,
if
every
licensed
driver
who
had
been
convicted,
had
a
big
thing
upon
his
windshield,
i
am
a
convicted
felony
murderer,
but
the
public
does
not
know
that.
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
see
that
you
can
justify
saying
that
a
man
who
has
not
applied
for
a
license
until
after
he
was
convicted
is
automatically
dangerous.
dop
you
see
my
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
i
might
think
they
are
both
dangerous.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
stop
both
of
them
from
driving.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
drivers
are
involved
in
this,
do
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
would
not
--
there
are
no
figures
on
an
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
he
previously
been
licensed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
reapplid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
cruel
and
the
human
punishment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
tell
a
man
he
cannot
have
a
license
to
drive
a
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
least
you
do
not
agree
with
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
presumptive,
i
left
out
before
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
alleging
that
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
commissioner
investigates
every
applicant
for
a
chauffeur's
driver's
license
as
to
his
character,
his
employment
etcetera.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
ordinance
provides.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
up
in
the
thousands?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
city
of
chicago
how
many
taxis
do
you
have?
1,000?
justice
thurgood
marshall
impossible.
you
do
not
really
assume
that
they
--
all
you
are
doing
you
are
going
to
take
a
license
and
you
answer
some
questions,
isn't
that
a
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you,
but
are
you
saying
that,
that
is
actually
the
practice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
that
you
do
not
know
what
the
practice
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it,
that
you
do
not
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
contention
as
this
one
as
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
your
possession
that
the
city
in
this
case
was
just
about
every
single
one
of
the
provisions
of
this
ordinance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
is
what
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
it
shows
what
their
motive
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
my
question
again
is,
that
requires
a
city
to
justify
each
provision
as
being
"rational".
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
you
want
to
put
on
the
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
that
the
burden
you
want
us
to
put
on
the
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
that
the
city
now
has
to
judge
by
each
one
including
incest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
because
you
could
not
rationally
deny
a
license
to
a
person
guilty
of
incest,
you
cannot
hold
your
man
responsible,
that
is
your
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
say
the
only
reason
is
the
protection
of
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
safety
probably
is
the
only
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
--
you
do
not
have
any
other
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
denying
licenses
to
convicted
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
incests.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
you
are
a
cab
driver
who
drive
the
families,
right.
[laughter]
