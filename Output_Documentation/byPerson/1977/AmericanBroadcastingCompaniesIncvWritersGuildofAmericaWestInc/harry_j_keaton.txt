mr.
harry
j.
keaton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
allotted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
cover
primarily
two
contentions
in
this
case.
the
first
one
being
the
contention
of
the
guild,
the
respondent
herein,
that
in
some
ways
of
work
done
by
the
hyphenates,
whatever
you
might
call
it
and
they
do
not
call
it
struck
work
in
their
briefs,
they
call
it
rank-and-file
work
without
using
the
word
struck,
that
in
some
ways,
that
work,
put
the
work
on
a
pie
is
a
work
that
this
court
held
in
florida
power
to
be
of
the
nature,
the
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
should
not
apply.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself,
is
that,
mr.
come
referred
to
as
a
deprivation
theory
in
somewhat
more
detail.
as
to
the
first
point
that
the
three-throng
argument
being
made
by
the
guild
at
this
point.
it
comes
down
to
this.
number
one,
while
there
concededly
is
no
evidence
in
the
court,
that
any
writing
of
scripts
was
done
by
any
of
the
people
who
were
disciplined,
they
might
have
done
writing.
number
two,
that
the
“"a
through
h"”
functions
are
to
be
construed
as
bargaining
unit
type
writing
and
number
three,
that
even
if
the
“"a
through
h"”
functions
are
not
bargaining
unit
writing,
they
are
not
managerial
functions,
and
that
therefore,
the
performance
of
such
functions
is
not
akin
to
grievance
related
type
work,
and
therefore,
the
supervisors
could
be
disciplined.
now,
taking
the
first
point,
namely
yes
to
whether
or
not
they
might
have
done
the
right
thing,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
guild
very
well
knew
or
at
least
very
well
could
find
out,
whether
they
were
writing.
there
were
15
strike
rules
in
this
case,
which
provide
specifically
prohibition
against
writing.
not
one
of
them
was
invoked
by
the
guild,
not
a
single
one.
one
of
those
rules,
rule
8
is
very
significant
because
it
specified
that
any
writer
in
order
to
perfect
himself
and
that
includes
of
course
rank-and-file
writers,
to
protect
themselves
against
future
charges,
should
file
with
guild
his
scripts
that
he
had
completed
at
the
time
of
the
strike
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
will
be
able
prove
that
he
had
not
written
during
the
strike.
the
respondent’s
exhibit
six
which
is
not
in
the
printed
transcript
which
is
a
multi-colored
script
it
is
in
the
court,
will
illustrate
to
the
court
that
it
is
very
easy
to
tell
from
a
script
when
the
final
script
was
written
and
when
the
changes
were
made,
and
therefore,
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
for
the
guild
to
tell
whether
or
not
that
work
was
done.
now,
turning
to
“"a
through
h",”
the
guild
analogizes
in
“"a
through
h"”
to
the
shelton
construction
company
case,
the
shelton
pipeline
case,
wherein
the
b
representative
was
held
not
immune
from
discipline
because
he
was
offering
equipment
which
he
had
also
operated
at
times
when
there
was
a
labor
shortage,
but
that
case
is
precisely
the
opposite
from
this
case
because
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement,
operating
equipment
was
covered
by
the
contract,
by
so
many
words,
and
then
the
contract
said,
in
the
case
of
an
emergency
of
the
purposes
of
training,
a
supervisor
may
operate
the
equipment
not
so
if
you
are
“"a
through
h".”
the
contract
specifically
states
in
sections
1
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
in
1
(c)
(1)
(a),
that
the
performance
of
“"a
through
h"”
functions
by
producers,
directors
or
story
supervisors,
shall
not
be
covered
by
this
agreement
and
shall
not
cause
them
to
become
writers
hereunder.
so,
what
you
really
have
is
not
collective
bargaining
unit
work
that
may
be
done
by
supervisors,
but
work
that
is
not
covered
by
the
contract
which
if
you
perform
it,
does
not
make
you
a
bargaining
unit
employee,
but
which
conceivably
at
times
could
be
performed
by
bargaining
unit
employees.
but
now
comes
the
most
important
point,
namely
the
argument
that
“"a
through
h"”
supposedly
is
not
managerial.
let
us
examine
what
“"a
through
h"”
is
and
if
the
court
please,
i
will
give
examples
of
it,
some
of
them
are
in
the
record
and
some
of
them
are
just
common
sense.
the
first
a
says,
cutting
for
time.
now,
what
does
it
mean?
it
means
deleting
a
portion
of
a
movie
or
a
television
play
in
order
to
make
it
shorter,
in
order
to
accommodate
the
time
for
the
screen,
that
is
certainly
a
managerial
decision.
b
is
bridging.
that
means,
tying
up
two
pieces
of
the
movie,
if
you
will,
due
to
the
elimination
of
the
intervening
piece.
c
is
a
change
in
technical
or
stage
direction.
need
i
say
more,
direction?
d
is
the
assignment
of
lines
to
existing
characters
due
to
cast
changes,
directors
do
not
make
those
assignments,
managers
do.
e
are
changes
for
legal
clearances,
done
by
executives
at
the
request
of
the
legal
department
according,
in
the
transcript,
the
testimony
of
mr.
middleman,
pages
1307
to
page
1311
at
the
association
exhibit
9.
now,
the
casual
minor
adjustments
in
dialog
covered
under
f,
again
there
is
an
example
given.
medical
terminology
used
by
a
writer,
which
happens
to
be
erroneous,
so
they
call
a
doctor,
the
doctor
says
the
diagnosis
is
all
wrong
and
they
change
the
name
of
the
illness
from
one
to
another,
again,
done
by
management.
g
are
changes
necessitated
by
unforeseen
events.
an
example
is
in
the
transcript
at
page
204
to
205.
what
happened
to
us,
that
they
had
to
change
the
names
of
streets
from
new
york
city
to
los
angeles
and
h
finally,
by
its
own
language,
which
is
clearly
managerial
work.
it
is
instructions,
directions
or
suggestions,
oral
or
written
to
a
writer.
all
of
this
work
is
about
as
managerial
as
it
can
be
and
the
interesting
distinction
is
that
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
lowest
level
of
bargaining
unit
work,
namely
the
so
called
rewrite
that
is
carefully
defined
in
the
agreement,
and
you
can
get
motion
picture
credit
for
doing
a
rewrite.
you
can
do
all
the
“"a
through
h"”
in
the
world
without
getting
any
motion
picture
credit,
there
is
no
credit
for
that,
but
on
a
rewrite,
that
sure
is
a
credit,

b
and
c.
the
writer's
guild
contends
here
as
the
last
resort
on
this
issue
--
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
that
is
not
entirely
correct
your
honor.
we
are
not
relying
on
the
"a
through
h"
functions
at
the
establishing
the
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
capacities
of
the
supervisors,
but
anyone
of
the
steps
taken
in
"a
through
h"
that
i
described
to
you
might
very
well
lead
to
a
grievance
and
indeed
a
grievance
of
a
writer,
because
most
of
them
involve
scripts
to
illustrate
your
honor
if
i
may.
writers
have
the
privilege,
in
fact
the
contractual
right
to
watch
the
screening
of
the
final
cut
of
a
movie
and
if
that
time
the
writer
finds
that
the
picture
did
not
come
out
the
way
he
hoped
it
would,
he
may
very
well
raise
a
grievance
with
the
associate
producer
who
made
the
cuts
on
the
picture
and
may
say
to
him,
i
do
not
like
the
way
you
did
this
ending,
you
deleted
a
hundred
feet
of
footage
that
i
had
in
there
which
was
my
beautiful
idea
and
now,
it
is
a
sad
ending
instead
of
a
happy
one.
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
no
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
the
test,
but
if
the
person
who
is
making
the
decision
also
has
the
authority
to
adjust
that
grievance,
that
would
be
the
test.
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
no
sir,
he
does
not.
he
does
it
by
virtue
of
his
position.
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
he
might.
he
might
very
well
and
i
might
also
say
that
the
physical
change
of
a
movie
in
cutting
for
instance
might
occur
because
the
editor
has
made
the
cut
who
is
a
person
who
is
not
the
hyphenate.
there
are
hyphenate
editors
in
this
case.
now,
to
turn
briefly
to
the
deprivation
theory
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
guild,
first
of
all
i
think
we
should
dispose
of
an
item
if
it
is
of
concern
at
all
here,
namely
the
contention
of
both
the
guild
and
amicus,
that
there
was
in
some
way,
nothing
that
could
be
brought
before
this
court
own
the
deprivation
theory
because
it
was
not
part
of
the
board's
decision.
in
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court
of
appeals,
in
its
reply
brief,
the
guild
argued
exactly
the
opposite.
at
page
4
of
that
brief,
the
guild
stated,
just
as
it
did
the
board’s
brief
writer,
the
association
seeks
to
justify
the
decision
below
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
rationale
of
later
decided
both
decisions.
there
was
only
one
basis,
upon
which
a
violation
was
found
here,
namely,
that
the
guild's
discipline
kept
the
employers
from
utilizing
the
services
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
supervisors
during
the
strike,
not
as
a
subsequent
decision
in
other
cases,
rationalized
that
the
discipline
would
carry
over
to
the
supervisors’
future
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions.
the
guild
is
now
arguing
exactly
the
opposite
in
this
court,
that
this
was
not
the
basis
of
the
board
decision
and
only
the
future
function
about
the
basis.
the
answer
of
course
is
both
are.
now,
in
terms
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
violated
here,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
get
involved
with
such
things
as
oakland
mailers
because
what
we
really
have
is
the
other
simple
preposition.
we
have
people
who
were
told,
unlike
in
florida
power,
if
you
come
to
work
in
any
capacity,
including
of
course
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
capacities,
we
will
fine
you,
we
will
discipline
you,
we
will
expel
you
and
you
cannot
resign,
all
those
things
were
said
and
to
answer
further
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
of
mr.
come,
i
do
not
think
that
a
union
can
fall
back
on
what
might
well
be
a
legal
picket
line,
if
at
the
same
time
that
the
picket
line
is
up,
it
is
threatening
people
and
coercing
people
and
telling
them,
if
you
do
cross
over
a
picket
line,
we
will
punish
you.
anymore,
than
this
court
would
hold
illegal,
that
if
a
union
has
gone
to
an
employer
and
said
to
him,
we
would
like
you
cease
dealing
with
another
employer
that
this
picket
line
that
was
subsequently
established
would
in
some
way
be
immunized
because
the
employer
may
have
exited
because
of
the
unions’
voluntary
request,
rather
than
the
illegal
secondary
boycott
under
the
8
(b)
(4)
(b).
i
think
the
analogy
is
very
much
the
same.
now,
what
really
have
here
is
very
simple.
the
union
in
effect
is
saying,
you
must
not
use
these
supervisors.
it
means
we
eliminate
the
supervisors.
they
cannot
be
designated.
if
they
cannot
be
designated,
you
have
a
clear
violation
of
the
statute
itself
and
you
have
the
violation,
just
as
surely
as
the
union
had
put
up
a
picket
line
to
prevent
the
hiring
of
a
supervisor
or
the
use
of
a
designated
representative
of
the
employer
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
it
is
precisely
the
case
of
congress
was
talking
about
in
the
legislative
history.
senator
taft,
i
believe
said,
do
not
send
us
mr.
y
and
send
us
mr.
x,
mr.
y
as
being
excluded
in
this
case.
the
union
will
argue,
they
could
resign,
in
fact
the
afl-cio
does,
not
so.
they
were
not
allowed
to
resign.
in
fact,
they
were
deactivated,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
aim
on
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
i
recognize
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
not
applicable
because
the
supervisors
are
not
protected,
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
themselves
indicate
very
clearly
that
even
there
discipline
would
not
be
lawful
if
there
is
not
any
right
to
resign
at
some
point.
since
i
want
to
reserve
a
little
time
for
a
rebuttal
for
mr.
come,
i
would
like
to
conclude
on
a
couple
of
points.
by
deactivating
and
keeping
the
supervisors
as
(inaudible)
members
in
effect
the
employers
were
being
given
two
choices.
either,
do
not
use
the
supervisors
during
the
strike,
in
other
words,
do
not
designate
them
as
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
representatives
and
there
was
plenty
of
work
going
on,
the
record
is
full
of
it,
scripts
were
being
written
and
scripts
were
available,
scripts
have
been
finished,
there
are
lots
of
them
in
the
record
and
no
other
union
must
strike,
either,
do
not
use
them
during
the
strike
or
if
you
do,
we
are
going
to
expel
them,
find
them,
and
punish
them
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
use
them
again
because
nobody
will
work
with
them
and
you
cannot
be
a
producer
without
the
writers.
those
were
the
choices
given
in
effect
to
management
and
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
only
way
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
sustained
is
this
court
were
to
ask
to
the
statute
the
provision,
this
section
shall
be
inapplicable
in
the
event
of
a
strike.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
j.
keaton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
allotted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
primarily
discuss
what
has
come
to
be
called
in
this
case
the
deprivation
theory.
it
is
basically
a
very
straightforward
and
simple
theory
as
it
was
described
by
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case.
it
does
not
require
consideration
such
as
whether
something
might
have
an
effect
in
the
future.
but
it
deals
with
the
present,
the
time
of
the
strike
and
the
basic
question
is,
does
the
union's
pressure
from
a
supervisor
not
to
work
by
coercion
and
restraint
and
threats
and
discipline.
foreseeably
could
it
have
the
effect
of
preventing
that
person
from
working
and
thereby
depriving
the
employer
of
the
selected
(8)(b)(1)(b)
representative
thereby
coercing
and
restraining
the
employer
in
such
selection.
the
classical
case
on
this
subject
was
the
horner
case
which
is
cited
on
our
brief
in
which
there
was
no
contract
and
the
union
instructed
the
union
members
to
withhold
their
services.
the
superintendent
on
the
job
was
a
union
member
and
he
too
was
instructed
not
to
work.
he
disobeyed
the
union's
order
and
was
punished.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
no
difficulty
fining
that
the
employee
had
been
coerced
and
restrained
in
the
selection
of
this
supervisor
of
the
8(b)(1)(b)
representative
because
the
foreseeable
effect
to
what
the
union
did
would
have
been
that
he
would
not
have
worked
or
alternatively
if
it
did
work
and
was
punished,
his
services
might
not
be
available
in
the
future.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
refusal
by
any
of
the
employees
to
work
including
the
supervisor.
the
effect
was
manifestly
unsuccessful,
i
am
stressing
that
point.
post
florida
power,
we
have
a
very
similar
situation.
in
the
case
involving
skippy
enterprises
now
know
us
wisconsin
river
valley
which
was
affirmed
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
decision
by
judge
becker.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
similar
situation.
there
were
two
union
elections,
both
lost.
after
the
election,
the
union
said
we
will
not
permit
any
members
to
work
on
this
job
and
they
told
the
superintendent
you
cannot
work
or
we
will
punish
you.
he
did
work
and
they
punished
him.
and
again
the
board
heard
it
to
be
an
8(b)(1)(b)
and
the
court
affirmed
on
the
theory
that
clearly
here
there
was
foreseeable
that
provision
of
the
employer
of
his
8(b)(1)(b)
designated
representative
and
therefore
for
coercion
and
restraint
in
the
selection.
now
the
very
important
point
of
this
to
be
made
is.
this
issue
was
not
really
before
the
court
in
florida
power.
why?
because
in
florida
power,
first
of
all,
at
least
in
the
illinois
florida
power,
the
supervisors
were
told
if
you
want
to
come
to
work,
we
would
love
to
have
you
come.
if
you
do
not
want
to
come
to
work
you
do
not
have
to.
they
will
not
even
designated
as
8(b)(1)(b)
representatives.
they
were
given
the
option
to
designate
themselves.
in
florida
powers,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
what
these
circumstances
were
because
it
is
a
stipulated
record
but
in
both
cases,
the
union
said
if
you
come
to
work
and
perform
your
normal
supervisory
functions
you
can
do
that,
we
will
not
punish
you.
thereby
clearly
not
interfering,
not
coercing,
not
restraining
the
employee
and
selection
if
one
accepts
of
you
as
a
majority
in
florida
power
that
struck
work
is
not
part
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
adjusting
and
not
emulated
to
it
because
the
whole
gamut
of
what
a
supervisor
does
could
have
been
done
without
any
interference
on
the
part
of
the
union.
now
the
touchstone
of
the
florida
power
case
actual
in
the
decision
was
the
future.
what
future
effect
may
the
conduct
of
the
union
have?
that
is
not
necessarily
needed
here
even
though
it
is
present
too
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
intended
curtain
effect
during
the
strike.
now,
in
this
case,
the
employers
ordered
the
union
representatives
to
work.
they
did
not
give
them
an
option,
only
the
supervisors,
only
the
normal
management
functions.
and
they
were
told,
if
you
do
not
come
to
work
we
will
discharge
you
and
we
will
fine
you.
the
union
on
the
other
hand
said,
you
cannot
work
at
all,
no
services
in
any
capacity
whatsoever
including
of
course
grievance
adjusting
and
collective
bargaining.
now
clearly,
the
union
threats
in
the
subsequent
discipline
had
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only.
one
just
has
to
look
at
what
preceded
the
strike.
real
activation
of
these
their
own
members
if
you
please
who
had
no
loyalty
obligations
to
the
union
whatsoever
who
were
paying
no
dues
and
had
no
union
benefits.
they
were
put
back
into
the
union
by
mandate
in
order
to
put
them
under
the
union's
yoke
and
the
neighbor's
union
to
force
them
not
to
work
and
there
by
prevent
the
employer
from
selecting
representatives.
now
whether
or
not
there
was
collective
bargaining
during
the
strike,
i
submit
is
not
really
relevant.
collective
bargaining
in
the
sense
of
negotiating
a
contract.
the
important
thing
is
that
these
people
who
went
to
work
were
authorized
to
negotiate
conflicts.
they
were
authorized
and
designated
to
settle
grievances.
now
the
union
was
in
no
way
here
relying
on
any
appeal
to
the
loyalty
of
the
supervisors.
quite
the
contrary
it
was
bringing
them
back,
drafting
them
if
you
will.
many
of
them
were
associate
members
who
did
not
have
the
right
to
vote
on
this
strike
rules
and
did
not
vote
on
them.
no
one
was
allowed
to
resign.
they
were
locked
in.
and
in
those
circumstances
they
were
told,
if
you
come
to
work
in
any
capacity
we
will
do
terrible
things
to
you
not
only
now
but
for
the
future.
you
will
never
be
able
to
work
again
putting
on
maximum
pressure
on
these
people
in
order
to
force
them
not
to
work
now
and
thereby
coercing
the
employer
for
the
present
as
well
as
for
the
future.
now
the
union
argues
here
basically
four
points
in
defense
of
its
position.
first
of
all,
it
says
that
there
is
no
8(b)(1)(b)
because
its
efforts
were
unsuccessful.
a
lot
of
people
came
to
work,
the
ones
they
fined
and
punished
and
attempted
to
expel
until
the
membership
reversed
them.
secondly,
that
the
motive
of
the
union
here
was
not
established
to
be
to
prevent
the
performance
of
8(b)(1)(b)
work
or
indeed
the
manner
of
such
performance.
and
thirdly,
the
union
argued
in
effect
that
8(b)(1)(b)
is
designed
to
protect
the
supervisor
rather
than
the
employer
but
only
in
the
performance
of
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjusting
functions.
all
premises,
all
of
those
four
premises
i
would
submit
are
totally
wrong.
beginning
with
the
first
one,
success
is
not
required
and
we
can
cut
through
all
the
other
possibilities
and
go
straight
to
florida
power
because
when
this
court
said
in
florida
power
that
a
violation
can
be
found
only
if
it
may
adversely
affect
the
conduct
of
the
supervisor,
very
obviously
the
court
did
not
say
will
affect.
it
said
may
affect.
that
does
not
have
to
be
success
within
the
terms
of
florida
power
itself.
and
again
in
florida
power
this
court
said
of
its
approval.cases
when
8(b)(1)(b)
had
been
found
when
attempt
was
made
to
force
an
employer
to
accept
only
union
members
and
supervisors.
so
without
going
beyond
the
decision
of
this
court
in
florida
power
it
manifestly
cleared
that
all
that's
involved
in
attempt,
are
not
success.
the
number
of
cases
in
8(b)(1)(b)
involving
all
the
attempts
are
legion.
the
union
relies
on
8(a)(3)
case
to
the
contrary,
8(a)(3)
does
not
deal
with
coercion
and
restraint.
it
deals
with
discrimination.
where
motive
is
important
and
a
lot
of
other
things
are
important
that
are
not
important
under
coercion
and
restraint.
as
to
the
motive
in
this
situation
incidentally,
the
question
here
is
clearly
not
why
the
union
was
doing
it
but
what
the
effect
of
the
employer
is.
that,
the
issue,
is
the
employer
being
restrained
and
coerced?
if
he
is,
no
one
cares
why
the
union
did
what
it
did,
against
turning
to
the
florida
power
language,
the
question
is
what
the
effect
is,
not
what
the
motivations
were.
8(b)(1)(b)
comprises
what
the
union
suggests
in
its
supplemental
brief.
it
is
not
intended
to
protect
supervisors.
it
is
crystal
clear
under
section
2,
3,
11,
and
14
of
the
act
that
supervisors
have
no
section
7
guides
to
protect.
the
protection
is
afforded
to
the
employer
in
its
selection
of
supervisors.
and
furthermore,
that
protection
is
accorded
to
the
employer
not
in
the
performance
of
the
function
but
in
the
selection
of
the
persons
who
will
perform
the
function
that
is
the
issue.
now
let
us
do
the
performance
of
the
function.
on
prior
argument,
there
was
a
discussion
and
questions
from
the
court
to
counsel
for
the
union
and
it
ultimately
in
effect
counsels
for
the
union
conceded
that
if
a
supervisor
came
in
with
an
affidavit
i
believe
was
the
language
stating,
i
will
do
only
8(b)(1)(b)
work,
i
will
only
adjust
grievances
and
bargains
collectively,
then
indeed
the
union
could
not
punish
him.
well,
your
honors,
looking
at
this
realistically
other
than
academically,
what
we
have
here
is
a
concession
that
a
man
who
maybe
paid
as
much
as
$10,000.00
a
week
is
a
producer
of
a
motion
picture
or
even
more
can
be
brought
in
by
an
employer
to
sit
there
for
a
day,
a
week,
a
month,
or
maybe
a
year
until
a
grievance
arises
which
he
has
a
right
to
adjust.
no
one
knows
when
grievances
occur.
no
one
can
predict
and
to
say
that
employers
can
bring
in
supervisors
for
the
sole
purpose
of
doing
8(b)(1)(b)
work
is
to
say
that
it
can
be
made
economically
impossible
for
them
to
make
the
selection
and
therefore
they
have
to
select
someone
else.
and
to
me
the
situation
is
absolutely
no
way
different
from
the
situation
in
california
cottage
company
208
nlrb
994

page

affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
515
section
1018
and
in
which
this
court
denied
cert,
where
a
labor
organization
at
longshoremen
union
of
the
pacific
maritime
association
entered
into
a
contract
in
which
they
said
if
any
containers
have
to
be
handled
that
have
not
been
stuffed
by
longshoremen,
then
we
will
impose
a
tax
on
those
containers
and
it
was
a
pretty
stiff
tax.
and
the
board
held
and
the
court
affirmed
that
the
imposition
of
that
tax
was
exactly
the
same
thing
as
saying
we
will
not
handle
the
containers.
and
i
submit
in
the
same
way
in
this
case,
one
cannot
say,
that
the
8(b)(1)(b)
rights
of
the
employers
to
select
the
representative
are
really
protected.
if
he
has
to
pay
the
price
of
having
someone
sit
all
day
waiting
for
a
possible
grievance.
now,
the
work
involved
here
in
the
last
argument
by
the
union
is
of
course
that
some
of
the
work
here
involved
collective
bargaining
type
work.
while
the
a
through
h
function
says
we
discussed
on
prior
argument
are
very
clearly
managerial
work.
first
of
all
the
conflict
says
that
they
are
not
covered
by
the
conflict
but
performed
by
excluded
personnel
and
secondly,
by
there
are
very
initial
decisions
involved
are
management
decisions.
in
that
respect,
the
work
differs
importantly
from
the
florida
power
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
clearly
was
not
work
that
was
struck
work
in
the
legal
sense
of
the
bargaining
units
work
in
the
sense
but
more
importantly
it
is
managerial
work.
and
this
managerial
work
of
any
sort
from
which
grievances
flow.
if
someone
is
performing
management
work,
that
is
how
grievances
come
about
and
if
the
person
who
is
the
manager
performing
these
functions
has
grievance
adjustment
authority
as
all
these
people
did
then
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
performance
of
these
management
functions
is
"grievance
related"
as
this
court
stated
in
florida
power
and
its
majority
opinion.
now,
basically
8(b)(1)(b)
i
would
submit
is
a
policy
determination,
unambiguously
expressed
by
congress
as
mr.
justice
stevens
said
in
an
opinion.
namely,
and
i
do
not
mean
on
this
subject,
but
on
a
different
statute
equally,
unambiguously
expressed
here
that
the
intent
is
to
protect
the
employer's
right
to
select
its
management
representatives
free
of
coercion
or
restraint
by
the
union,
that
is
the
issue.
and
i
think
the
only
way
that
court
could
fine
in
favor
the
right
of
guild
in
this
case
would
be
to
in
effect
tack
to
the
statute
of
provision
saying,
this
provision
shall
be
inapplicable
in
case
of
a
strike.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
