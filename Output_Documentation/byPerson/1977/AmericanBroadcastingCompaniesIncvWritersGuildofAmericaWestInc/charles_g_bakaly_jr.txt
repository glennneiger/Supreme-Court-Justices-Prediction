mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
about
the
"a
through
h."
it
is
clear
that
"a
through
h"
was
not
struck
work.
struck
work,
is
work
which
would
have
been
done
by
the
bargaining
unit
employees,
but
for
the
strike.
the
"a
through
h"
work
is
never
done
by
the
employees.
it
is
done
only
by
the
producers,
the
associate
producers
and
the
story
consultants
and
so
forth.
so
that,
it
is
clear
that
"a
through
h"
cannot
be
struck
work.
i
would
like
to
talk
a
moment
about
it.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
would
agree
what
mr.
keaton
said
about
that,
but
the
authority
for
grievance
handling
and
collective
bargaining
is
in
the
record
apart
from
"a
through
h."
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
in
and
off
itself,
i
would
agree
with
that.
now,
let
me
talk
about
the
adverse
carryover
theory
of
the
board
for
liability
of
the
union
in
this
case
and
that
theory
started
with
florida
power.
in
florida
power,
the
court
said,
a
union
discipline
of
one
of
its
members
who
is
a
supervisor
employee
can
constitute
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
only
when
that
discipline
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisor's
conduct
in
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
and
acting
in
his
capacity
as
grievance
suggester
or
collective
bargainer
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
now,
that
is
where
we
start
and
in
this
case,
we
have
tremendous
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
guild
which
judge
moore
in
the
second
circuit
characterizes
in
terrorem
conduct
to
adversely
affect
the
supervisors
in
the
future.
not
only,
are
we
talking
about
the
fines
of
up
to
$50,000.00
or
the
threats
or
the
refusal
to
accept
resignations,
but
more
importantly,
they
blacklist
them
and
to
understand
the
effect
of
that
on
an
associate
producer
or
a
producer
whose
whole
livelihood
is
because
he
gets
the
right
creative
people
to
work
with
him,
that
if
he
wants
a
writer
to
work
for
him
in
the
future
in
another
production
and
he
understands
that
because
of
what
he
does
now,
that
writer
is
not
going
to
work
for
him,
that
blacklisting
threat
has
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
producer
in
the
future.it
has
an
effect
upon
the
director.
it
has
an
effect
upon
all
of
these
hyphenates
and
his
conduct,
to
say
that
this
kind
of
conduct
does
not
engender
fear
in
that
supervisor,
so
that
in
the
future
when
that
union
or
any
other
union
says
to
him
to
do
something
that
the
union
wants,
he
is
going
to
think
that
if
he
does
not
do
what
the
union
wants,
he
is
going
to
have
that
same
kind
of
punishment
again.
this
adverse
effect,
certainly
affects
supervisors
who
in
fact
adjust
writers
grievances
and
we
have
evidence
of
some
of
the
supervisors
adjust
writers
grievances.
it
would
affect
supervisors
who
adjust
grievances
of
other
employees
like
directors
because
people
do
not
just
think
about
one
union
and
what
it
does.
what
one
union
can
do
another
union
can
do
and
if
the
writers
guild
can
cause
writers
not
to
work
with
an
associate
producer
then
the
directors
guild
can
cause
directors
not
to
work
with
an
associate
producer
and
the
director
is
very
much
concerned
with
that.
there
is
one
bit
of
testimony
in
the
record
that
just
cries
out,
and
mr.
crichton
who
was
talking
with
mr.
furia,
the
leader
of
the
writers
guild
and
the
president
of
the
writers
guild
and
crichton
is
saying
“i
told
him
finally
that
if
push
came
to
shove,
i
would
be
rather
be
thrown
out
of
the
writers
guild
than
the
directors
guild
since
i
felt
my
future
was
really
more
with
the
directors
guild”
and
he
explained
it
was
not
that
simple.
if
i
were
expelled
from
the
writers
guild
i
could
not
work
as
a
director
in
the
future,
work
solely
as
a
director
because
members
of
the
writers
guild
could
not
work
as
directors
and
me
as
a
director
if
i
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
writers
guild.
that
kind
of
threat
has
to
have
an
adverse
effect
in
the
future
and
that
adverse
effect,
that
carryover
effect
does
pertain
to
the
selection
of
the
representative
for
grievance
handling
and
for
a
collective
bargaining.
so,
not
just
a
question
of
identities
the
guild
would
have.
what
an
employer
wants,
he
wants
the
supervisor
who
will
do
what
he
says.
he
wants
a
supervisor
that
will
be
tough
with
the
union
perhaps,
if
that
is
the
way
that
particular
employer
wants,
while
the
union
buy
this
kind
of
discipline
and
threats
can
change
that
supervisor
from
a
tough
supervisor
to
a
supervisor
that
agrees
with
the
union
and
then
they
are
in
effect
changing
the
identity.
employers
do
not
really
care
whether
a
supervisor
has
a
black
hair
or
red
hair.
they
do
not
care
about
that.
they
care
how
he
is
going
to
perform
with
the
union.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
in
florida
power,
no.
i
do
not
believe
they
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no,
in
fact
i
believe
that
is
where
the
theory
was
originated
from
the
language
that
i
said
mr.
justice
white,
you
were
in
the
dissent
in
that
case,
but
the
majority
did
definitely
state
that
plan,
the
discipline
may
adversely
effect.
they
are
talking
about
the
future
there
and
that
is
the
carryover
effect.
that
was
not
rejected
by
the
court
in
florida
power.
finally,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
relied
on
a
great
deal
by
the
guild
is
the
argument
that
after
florida
power
the
loyalty
of
the
supervisor
member
to
its
employer
is
irrelevant
and
without
merit.
and
that
language
comes
from
the
court
that
says
that
it
has
a
statement
in
florida
power
about
loyalty
not
being
a
part
of
the
remedy
that
congress
intended
for
the
solution
of
the
conflict
over
all
these
problems.
now,
assuring
loyalty
is
really
one
of
the
only
purposes
for
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
why
else
would
the
court
put
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
why
would
the
legislature
put
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b)?
it
is
perfectly
logical
to
have
grievance
handlers
as
the
most
senior
person.
why
not
let
the
bargaining
decide
that?
well,
the
reason
has
to
be
because
as
i
said
earlier,
that
one
of
things
that
an
employer
wants
other
than
competence
and
an
articulate
supervisor
perhaps,
but
he
wants
the
one
who
is
loyal
to
him.
he
wants
the
one
that
will
do
what
he
wants
done
in
the
handling
of
grievances
in
the
collective
bargaining,
so
the
loyalty
is
still
a
part
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
now,
the
respondent
says
that
the
only
solution
is
to
keep
supervisor
that
has
the
union.
that
solution
really
proves
too
much
as
the
court,
as
the
court
again
said
there
are
instances
where
a
supervisor
does
or
a
union
does
violate
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
by
adversely
affecting
the
supervisor’s
conduct.
now,
the
court
in
florida
power
recognizes
that
there
can
be
a
situation
where
a
supervisor
member
is
threatened,
is
disciplined
and
that
adversely
affects
his
conduct.
we
submit
that
this
is
that
case.
with
this
kind
of
in
terrorem
conduct
that
judge
moore
said
certainly
these
supervisors
would
be
adversely
affected
and
these
employers
would
be
deprived
of
their
grievance
handlers
and
collective
bargainers
and
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
time
for
mr.
come's
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
one
observation
concerning
the
deprivation
theory
before
i
talk
about
the
adverse
theory
effect.
the
guild
contends
that
the
board
did
not
make
findings
that
the
threats
were
made
to
others
than
those
who
worked.
i
would
like
to
submit
that
that
statement
is
erroneous
in
the
board's
decision
in
the
petition
at
the
appendix
b3,
the
board
goes
on
to
say
that
it
sustains
the
complaints
alleged
violation
of
section
8(b)(1)(b)
of
the
act
in
toto
and
13(d)
of
the
second
amended
complaint
alleges
that
commencing
february
through
the
promulgation
of
its
strike
rules
and
rule
30,
its
blacklist
rule
and
by
other
actions
if
threatened
numerous
persons
occupying
the
positions
of
the
hyphenates
that
for
all
times
in
the
future,
no
member
or
respondent
would
work
with
or
perform
services
for
them
if
they
failed
to
honor
or
otherwise
support
the
strike
described
in
paragraph
10
above.
that
i
submit
is
a
finding
by
the
board
that
there
were
threats
to
hyphenates
other
than
those
who
crossed
the
picket
line
that
they
would
be
threatened
and
blacklisted
if
they
did
cross
the
picket
line
and
failed
to
honor
the
strike.
now,
with
respect
to
the
second
theory
of
the
board
which
i
would
like
to
direct
most
of
my
time,
the
adverse
carryover
effect
theory
begins
with
this
court's
decision
in
florida
power
where
it
has
been
said
the
court
stated
that
the
union's
discipline,
one
of
its
members
who
was
a
supervisory
employee
can
constitute
a
violation
at
8(b)(1)(b)
only
when
that
discipline
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisor's
conduct
in
performing
the
duties
of
an
acting
as
the
grievance
adjuster
or
collective
bargainer.
now
this
conduct
of
the
guilds
in
this
case
which
judge
moore
in
his
dissent
in
the
second
circuit
characterized
as
the
guild's
in
terrorem
conduct.
certainly
would
have
an
adverse
carryover
effect
to
supervisors
in
the
future.
not
only
are
the
fines
absolutely
horrendous
$50,000.00
even
to
somebody
making
$5,000.00
a
week
is
a
substantial
sum
of
money.
the
threats
to
expel
from
the
union
is
certainly
substantial
but
more
importantly
the
blacklisting
threats
to
creative
people
is
absolutely
an
abhorrent.
the
fact
that
after
the
strike
started,
the
guild
rescinded
rule
30
really
does
not
absolve
the
guild
or
does
the
after
effect
reduction
of
the
$50,000.00
fines
take
away
the
fact
that
the
threats
were
made
and
they
had
an
effect.
the
guild
or
any
other
union
could
blacklist
in
the
future
if
this
court
holds
such
kinds
of
unlawful
and
furthermore
the
role
of
dishonor
was
not
rescinded
at
all.
there
is
evidence
that
it
may
well
have
continued
in
effect
while
the
guild
argues
with
individual
members
acting
along
might
have
been
able
to
refuse
to
work
with
as
they
call
them
scabs.
certainly,
they
could
not
do
it
in
concert
and
they
could
not
do
it
if
the
guild
suggested
it
or
condoned
it
and
we
submit
that
the
evidence
here
is
certainly
very
strong
that
that
occurred.
now
the
unions
says,
well,
the
employer
could
take
care
of
the
effects
of
this
after
the
strike
by
requiring
resignation
and
they
could
require
the
supervisors
to
resign
after
the
strike
and
then
in
the
future
they
would
not
have
the
power
to
submit
that
this
is
--
well,
all
that
really
could
not
happen
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
blacklist
and
the
throughout
the
blacklist
is
still
there?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
i
think
so
your
honor
by
the
union.
you
say
that
you
will
not
work
with
other
members
when
your
whole
livelihood
depends
upon
your
ability
to
attract
the
best
creative
people,
yes
i
think
that
is
definitely
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
oh
i
do
not
think
so.
however
there
is
a
difference
that
here
the
associate
producer
and
the
director's
sold
their
value,
their
services
as
the
ability
to
get
outstanding
creative
people
to
work
with
them
and
that
is
not
quite
the
same
as
a
carpenter
or
someone
working
with
the
carpenter
and
so
i
think
there
may
well
be
a
difference
in
this
industry
because
of
that
situation.
but
nevertheless,
the
answer
to
the
question
about
resignation
after
the
strike
is
whether
that
then
was
the
remedy
for
the
employer.
the
blacklist
would
still
be
there
and
remember
that
the
record
is
clear
that
the
guild
have
the
right
to
prevent
resignation
for
two
years
after
the
strike
of
any
member.
and
of
course,
we
submit
that
the
self-help
options
really
are
not
valid
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
a
substantial
percentage
or
the
management
people
comes
from
the
rank-and-file
and
will
return
to
the
position
of
writers
as
time
passes
and
as
a
practical
matter,
resignation
just
is
not
going
to
get
us
the
kind
of
producers
that
we
need.
producers
have
to
have
the
ability
to
work
with
the
writers
and
therefore
we
feel
that
the
self-help
options
are
really
not
valid.
there
is
no
question
about
what
this
conduct
did
in
gender
fear
and
the
supervisor's
members
and
gender
fear
and
to
those
who
adjusted
writers
grievances
and
gender
fear
and
those
who
adjusted
grievances
of
other
employees
because
employees
do
not
differentiate
between
the
kind
of
union
that
makes
the
threats.
one
union
makes
the
threat
and
they
feel
that
any
union
can
also
make
a
similar
threat.
the
record
is
to
replete
with
evidence
of
the
effect
these
threats
upon
individuals
and
i
will
not
go
on
to
that
at
this
point
in
time.
the
carryover
effect
clearly
restrains
the
selection
of
a
supervisor
as
a
statute
sets
forth.
if
a
union
cannot
by
threats
and
by
fines
change
the
way
a
supervisor
performs,
it
has
an
effect
negated
the
employer's
selection
and
has
changed
the
supervisor.
in
the
legislative
history,
mr.
senator
taft
talks
about
mr.
'x'
and
mr.
'y'.well
suppose,
that
mr.
'x'
is
a
person
who
rigorously
enforces
the
contract,
keeps
the
union
employees
towing
the
mark
and
supervisor
'y'
is
very
easy
and
very
soft
upon
the
employees
and
if
that
employer
wants
supervisor
'x',
certainly
if
the
union
can
then
fine
supervisor
'x'
to
such
an
extent
but
to
turn
him
and
the
supervisor
'y',
a
supervisor
that
acts
better
towards
the
union
members
and
softer
towards
them,
he
has
in
effect
changed,
the
union
has
an
effect
changed
the
selection
of
that
employer
from
'x'
to
'y.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
question
for
the
board
to
decide
mr.
justice
stevens
and
the
board
is
the
agency
which
congress
has
"expertise
and
experience".
it
is
found
that
this
kind
of
conduct
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisors
in
the
way
they
perform
their
grievance
adjusting
or
collective
bargaining
in
the
future
and
i
believe?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
correct
and
that
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
am
using
a
situation
where
both
do
not
cross
the
line.
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
that
you
have
a
situation?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
certainly,
it
may
well
be
the
fact
and
that
of
course,
goes
to
the
deprivation
theory
which
is
the
first
theory
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
really
think
on
the
carryover
theory.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
we
have
two
separate
supervisors
--
let
us
take
away
from
the
picket
line
for
a
moment.
we
have
two
separate
supervisors
or
two
candidates,
'x'
and
'y'
and
the
employer
wants
'x'
because
of
his
certain
characteristics.
if
the
union
can
fine
'x'
and
turn
him
into
somebody
like
'y'
then
they
in
effect
have
changed
the
employer's
selection
from
'x'
to
y,
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
this
was
just
the
kind
of
action
that
senator
taft
was
talking
about
but
employees
cannot
say
to
their
employer
we
do
not
like
mr.
'x,
we
will
not
meet
mr.
'x',
you
have
to
send
us
mr.
'y.
that
has
been
done,
it
would
prevent
their
saying
to
the
employer
you
have
to
fire
foreman
jones
and
therefore
you
have
to
fire
him
or
we
will
not
go
to
work.
certainly,
we
have
in
this
case
when
the
guild
establish
this
blacklist
and
the
roll
of
dishonor,
they
were
really
saying,
here
is
a
list
of
foreman
jones
who
we
will
not
work
with
and
therefore
a
list
of
people
the
employer
cannot
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
either
one.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
can
assume
that
the
people
that
the
employer
wanted
to
work
were
all
'x's.i
think
you
can
assume
that.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
what
i
am
using
is
the
example
of
how
you
can
turn
by
fines
someone
into
a
different
person.
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
for
the
board
to
decide.
the
board
decided
that
it
may
well
have
been
done
and
that
is
in
its
expertise
that
as
the
agency
that
has
this
experience,
it
made
that
finding
and
we
submit
that
that
finding
is
?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
with
inferences
and
with
their
knowledge
of
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
you
may
call
on
that
mr.
justice
marshall
but
that
is
really
what
the
congress
intended
this
agency
to
do
was
to
take
from
their
knowledge
of
what
occurs
in
real
everyday
life
and
they
made
the
decision.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
would
like
to
reserve
mr.
chief
justice
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
excuse
me,
i
thought
we
were
through.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
so
assume.
