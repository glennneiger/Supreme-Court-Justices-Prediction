are
we
in
a
rather
unreal
situation
in
this?
who
is
going
to
do
with
any
bargaining
or
grievance
procedure
when
the
employees
are
in
strike
out
there?
unknown
speaker
because
we
are
hypothesizing
a
strike
when
the
ordinary
employees
are
not
there,
there
is
nobody
to
file
a
grievance,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
was
"a
through
h"
work?
unknown
speaker
and
in
florida
power
those
who
have
crossed
the
line
to
do
supervisory
work
were
not
fined?
