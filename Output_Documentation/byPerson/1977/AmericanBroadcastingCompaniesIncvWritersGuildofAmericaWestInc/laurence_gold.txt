mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
florida
power
&
light
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
that
the
board’s
view
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
had
evolved
to
the
point
that
it
served
as
a
“general
prohibition
of
the
unions,
disciplining
supervisor
members
for
their
conduct
in
the
course
of
representing
the
interest
of
their
employer.”
i
suggest
that
as
mr.
come
made
quite
clear,
the
board
has
continued
to
hue
to
that
view
with
one
exception.
they
now
say
that
in
a
situation
in
which
the
supervisor
member
performs
a
substantial
amount
of
rank-and-file
work,
some
of
which
is
struck
work
that
the
union
can
discipline
the
supervisor.
we
suggest
that
that
analysis
is
no
more
responsive
to
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
than
the
broad
position
taken
before
this
court
the
last
time
this
question
was
here
because
as
mr.
reich
indicated,
at
the
end
of
his
argument,
it
is
our
position
that
assuming
that
oakland
mailers
is
correct,
namely
assuming
that
the
section
does
not
simply
protect
employers
against
strikes
against
them,
but
protects
supervisors
against
discipline
for
performing
certain
functions
for
the
employer.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
given
the
full
scope
that
it
can
possibly
be
given
so
long
as
it
is
a
violation
for
the
union
to
discipline
the
supervisor
for
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
or
because
of
the
way
he
performs
those
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions,
but
that
the
union
has
a
privilege
which
congress
did
not
choose
to
take
away
of
disciplining
supervisor
members
for
performing
any
non-8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions.
we
think
that
line
is
that
so
long
as
the
cause
is
the
way
the
supervisor
performs
his
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function,
assuming
as
i
said
that
the
oakland
mailers
is
correctly
decided,
the
union
commits
a
violation,
but
that
if
the
union’s
discipline
is
based
on
the
way
the
supervisor
performs
other
supervisory
duties
or
rank-and-file
duties
or
the
fact
that
it
crosses
the
picket
line
and
thereby
tends
to
undermine
the
strike,
that
is
outside
the
prohibition
of
this
unfair
labor
practice.
at
that
point,
the
employer’s
option,
again
to
quote
from
florida
power
&
light
is
to
force
the
supervisor
to
resign
from
the
union,
thereby
protecting
his
interest
and
we
think
that
the
source
of
this
understanding
is
basically
on
three
different
facets
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history.
first
of
all,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
far
narrower
than
section
211.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
protects
employers
in
their
selections
of
grievance
handlers
and
negotiators
whereas
section
211
defines
supervisors
far
more
broadly.
both
sections
came
into
the
law
at
the
same.
if
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
unions
from
disciplining
supervisors,
it
would
have
written
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
to
say
that
is
unlawful
for
union
either
to
discipline
supervisors
or
unlawful
for
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
choice
of
his
supervisors,
simply
said
neither
of
those
things.
secondly,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
provision
created
no
stir
in
what
was
otherwise
as
this
court
again
has
noted
time
and
again,
one
of
the
most
though
for
legislative
conflicts
of
the
post
war
period
because
of
the
assurance
of
its
sponsors
that
it
had
a
narrow
scope
and
that
scope
basically
was
to
prefect
the
collective
bargaining
process
by
assuring
that
the
union
was
not
on
both
sides
of
the
table
in
both
selecting
its
own
representatives
and
selecting
or
having
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
employer
representatives.
the
more
difficult
and
controversial
issue
of
whether
to
restrict
the
right
of
supervisors
to
be
union
members
was
solved
through
section
14
and
211
and
23
in
favor
of
giving
the
employer
a
privilege
to
keep
supervisors
out
of
unions,
to
fire
supervisors
who
joined
unions
and
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
unions
about
supervisory
units,
even
where
the
union
had
majority
support
in
the
union,
thereby
reversing
the
decision
in
the
packard
motor
company
case.
it
is
not
surprising
i
would
contend
that
the
sponsors
of
23,
211
and
14
did
not
choose
to
give
supervisor
members
protection
in
law
against
discipline
as
supervisors
because
they
were
at
the
same
time
stripping
those
supervisor
members
of
all
legal
protection
vis-a-vis
the
employer.
i
think
that
we
of
course
have
deferred
with
many
aspects
of
taft-hartley,
but
senator
taft
was
not
the
type
of
man
who
would
carry
water
on
both
shoulders
at
least
that
blatantly.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
in
other
words
we
--
may
i
ask
a
question
about
that
because
under
our
position,
we
could
not
discipline
him
for
handling
the
grievance.
if
it
would
have
occurred
the
other
way,
we
could
discipline.
in
other
words,
he
goes
to
work
and
the
employer
says
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
be
subject
to
discipline.
i
will
not
do
supervisory
functions
or
i
will
do
rank-and-file
work.
mr.
laurence
gold
because
i
will
be
disciplined?
mr.
laurence
gold
if
the
union
disciplined
him
for
handling
the
grievance
that
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)?
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
why
i
asked
because
i
am
not
sure,
i
understood
it.
our
position
is
that
a
supervisor
member
crosses
a
picket
line,
he
does
work
what
we
are
calling
section
211
work,
but
it
is
not
handling
a
grievance,
our
position
is
the
union
can
discipline.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
union
cannot
fine
him
in
our
view
for
handling
the
grievance.
it
could
fine
him
but
doing
the
supervisory
work
other
than
handling
grievances.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
did
not
take
that
position.
i
have
gone
back
over
the
afl-cio
brief
and
we
simply
did
not
even
address
it.
in
the
union’s
brief,
the
ibw’s
brief,
they
argued
first
at
oakland
mailers
itself
was
wrong,
but
even
assuming
that
it
was
right,
the
union
could
fine
those
individuals
who
crossed
the
picket
line
and
did
rank-and-file
work.
they
limited
their
argument
that
way
because
under
their
internal
union
rules
they
did
not
choose
to
discipline
supervisors
who
did
not
do
struck
work.
so
that
was
the
only
issue
they
posed.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
facts
of
that
case
where
that
the
union
fined
people
for
doing
struck
work.
mr.
laurence
gold
but
--
mr.
laurence
gold
all
i
can
say
is
that
first
of
all
in
support
of
that
statement
they
quote
a
portion
of
the
transcript
in
oral
argument
of
the
counsel
for
the
union
and
he
said
that
even
assuming
that
oakland
mailers
is
correct,
unions
can
fine
individuals
for
performing
struck
work.
i
do
not
regard
that
as
a
concession.
secondly,
i
have
gone
over
our
brief
and
what
they
do
is
tax
us
for
saying
that
by
arguing
the
issue
presented
by
that
case,
namely
whether
unions
can
discipline
supervisors
for
doing
struck
work,
we
were
taking
the
opposite
position
on
211.
mr.
laurence
gold
right
and
we
believe
that
the
theory
of
your
opinion
in
florida
power
&
light
supports
our
attempt
to
win
this
case,
but
we
do
not
argue
that
we
have
already
won
this
case
by
reason
of
that
opinion.
we
are
arguing
that
the
rationale
particularly
a
point
made
in
your
opinion
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
narrower
than
211
and
that
the
overall
problem
of
assuring
that
supervisors
are
loyal
in
performing
non-8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
supports
our
view
here.
if
i
may,
since
it
being
through
our
interest,
i
am
going
to
quote
you
extensively.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
i
want
to
quote
another
court
opinion
that
you
are
also
the
author
of
it,
that
is
all
i
want
to
say.
we
think
that
the
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
situation
here
is
very
much
like
the
883
case
presented
in
american
ship
building.
there,
as
here,
you
had
a
situation
where
congress
left
something
to
employers,
namely
the
right
to
discipline
even
union
members
so
long
as
the
basis
for
the
discipline
was
not
their
union
activity
and
on
the
other
hand,
congress
in
883
made
it
unlawful
to
discipline
a
union
member
for
union
activity.
and
the
board,
of
course
read
883
to
create
a
prophylactic
rule
that
an
employer
could
never
lock
out,
and
the
theory
of
that
court
opinion
was
that
where
congress
leaves
the
privilege
on
the
one
hand
and
creates
a
prohibition
on
the
other,
the
board
can
prohibit
activity
motivated,
wrongfully
motivated,
but
cannot
prohibit
all
of
activity
which
has
adverse
effect
on
the
ground
that
that
is
necessary.
and
i
would
suggest
that
here
too,
if
oakland
mailers
is
correct,
the
board
has
moved
to
protect
the
supervisor
in
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
to
assure
that
a
union
cannot
discipline
the
supervisor
for
the
way
he
performs
that
function
or
for
the
fact
that
he
is
performing
to
go
the
next
step
and
say
it
is
necessary
or
else,
employers
will
believe,
i
mean
that
supervisors
will
believe
that
they
can
be
disciplined
for
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
to
assure
that
they
are
not
disciplined
for
anything.
we
believe
it
is
impermissible
because
we
think
that
it
cuts
into
the
privilege
that
congress
left
which
was
to
fine
or
otherwise
discipline
supervisor
members
for
activities
other
than
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
and
that
is
why
we
believe
that
both
they
so
called
carryover
theory
and
the
deprivation
theories
are
unsound.
the
board
has
a
direct
method
of
protecting
supervisor
members
who
are
disciplined
for
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
activities,
that
is
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
so
discipline
it
to
say
that
in
order
to
protect
them
you
must
go
one
step
further
and
assure
that
they
can
be
disciplined
for
anything.
it
seems
to
us
to
disregard
the
limitations
that
congress
observed
when
they
wrote
the
section
and
to
go
back
to
the
general
view
that
the
board
has
espoused
all
along,
making
only
the
narrowest
adjustment
for
florida
power
&
light.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
not.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
apologize.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right,
if
he
comes
to
the
union
or
the
employer
comes
to
union
and
says
this
man
is
going
to
perform
--
mr.
laurence
gold
the
union
can
fine
him
for
doing
the
supervisory
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right.
that
is
where
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
he
may
have
to
get
some
somebody
else,
but
that
will
be
his
choice
because
of
the
fact
that
the
union
cannot
exert
discipline
on
the
supervisor
for
doing
non-8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work.
it
will
not
be
because
the
union
is
transgressed
the
limitation.
in
terms
of
the
hypothetical
you
posed,
if
there
is
a
situation
in
which
the
employer
says
to
a
supervisor,
i
got
struck
work
that
has
to
be
done
during
this
strike
and
if
you
would
not
come
here
and
do
it
in
addition
to
doing
the
adjustment
of
grievances
or
bargaining,
i
am
going
to
fire
you
and
the
supervisor
says
i
will
not
do
that
because
i
will
be
fined
by
the
union.
we
think
the
minimum
that
florida
power
&
light
means
is
that
the
union
has
not
committed
a
violation
and
we
do
not
think
that
211
work
is
any
different
from
struck
work.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
would
be
a
violation
for
the
union
to
fine
the
man.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
that
in
a
real
world
the
employer
arguments
and
the
board
arguments
are
most
unlikely,
but
all
i
am
saying
is
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
think
it
is
very
rare.
i
can
think
of
some
situation.
one
suppose
the
employer
get
strike
breakers.
now,
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
handle
their
grievances,
but
he
may.
in
that
situation
if
he
wants
to
have
his
trusted
supervisor
handle
those
grievances,
we
think
we
would
violate
the
law
--
mr.
laurence
gold
or
in
this
case
there
were
grievances
with
other
union.
those
are
possibilities,
remote
possibilities,
we
are
not
arguing
that
our
theory
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
they
did
not
fine,
so
far
as
anything
the
board
has
said,
people
were
not
fined
for
performing
those
functions,
indeed
the
board
said
it
was
illegal.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
poses
the
question
of
fact
that
mr.
reich
was
arguing
and
responding
to
the
chief
justice’s
question.
it
may
be
that
the
union’s
threat
here
can
be
read
as
going
beyond
what
it
could
properly
do.
we
do
not
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
under
the
circumstance,
but
that
maybe,
but
that
does
not
justify
the
board’s
theory
because
the
board
finds
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
discipline
somebody
who
does
not
touch
a
grievance
and
that
we
say
is
beyond
the
pale.
that
is
what
the
board
was
not
given
the
right
to
do.
we
do
not
believe
that
supervisors
got
caught
blash
from
union
discipline
when
their
union
members,
we
think
that
they
got
protection
for
these
collective
bargaining
related
functions
and
nothing
else.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
that
the
union
would
have
to
have
a
basis
for
believing
that
he
was
doing
a
work
other
that
grievance
adjustment,
but
i
think
that
under
the
normal
rule
that
the
party
in
possession
of
the
facts
although
have
the
burden
of
going
forward,
i
would
think
that
they
ought
to
be
some
burden
on
him
to
show
that
he
did
not
do
anything
other
than
handle
grievances
and
bargain.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
logical
burden
of
proof.
in
other
words,
in
a
situation
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
something
like
green
v.
mcdonald
douglas
whether
under
title
vii
circumstance,
you
go
back
and
forth.
if
the
supervisor
came
up
to
the
picket
line
and
said
i
am
crossing
solely
to
do
bargaining
unit,
i
mean,
grievance
handling,
the
union,
it
might
be
fair
to
say
that
the
union
has
to
show
something
that
he
did
not
keep
his
word
or
be
in
the
soup.
on
the
other
hand,
he
just
goes
in
and
comes
up
against
the
background
where
he
has
never
solely
the
handling
of
grievances
and
says
goodbye
fellows,
i
am
going
to
this
line,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
proper
for
the
union
to
discipline
him
and
for
him
to
have
to
show
in
defense
that
he
restricted
his
work
to
grievance
handling
and
bargaining.
mr.
laurence
gold
on
the
union.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
i
have,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
outlining
the
board's
various
approaches
to
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
to
stating
the
defects
in
those
approaches
as
we
see
them
and
finally
to
suggesting
what
we
consider
to
be
the
proper
reading
of
that
provision.
for
the
first
20
years
after
this
provision
which
had
received
the
support
of
both
of
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
the
senate
and
one
of
the
very
few
provisions
in
taft-hartley
to
do
so
was
enacted.
the
board
took
the
position
consistent
with
the
language
and
legislative
history
that
if
a
union
applied
economic
pressure
directly
against
an
employer
to
get
him
to
change
his
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
handling
representative
that
was
a
violation
of
the
law
and
we
take
no
issue
at
all
whatever
with
that
reading
of
that
statute.
as
the
court
described
the
change
in
the
board's
thinking
in
the
oakland
mailers
case,
the
board
moved
on
to
the
proposition
that
disciplinary
action
against
an
individual,
a
supervisor
member
for
the
way
he
performs
his
grievance
handling
or
collective
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
that
is
why
i
corrected
myself
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
agree
with
that
point
entirely.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
oakland
mailers,
the
board
said
that
discipline
of
supervisor
members
for
the
way
they
perform
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
functions
violates
the
act
as
well
as
economic
pressure
directly
on
the
employer.
and
while
i
return
to
that
holding,
i
think
it
suffices
to
say
here
that
at
least
the
board's
approach
to
that
point
had
the
virtue
of
confining
itself
to
the
subjects
that
congress
had
indicated
it
wished
regulated
namely
the
selection
of
grievance
handling
and
collective
bargaining
representatives.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right
and
in
the
normal
collective
bargaining
situation
one
that
congress
was
most
particularly
concerned
about,
the
employer
said
he
will
not
be
a
supervisor.
then
the
board
took
what
we
regard
as
the
quantum
step
in
this
progression
and
stated
the
rule
that
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
is
a
general
prohibition
of
union
discipline
of
supervisor
members
for
the
conduct
in
the
course
of
representing
the
interest
of
the
employer
that
is
the
board's
language.
and
that
theory
came
to
this
court
in
the
florida
power
and
light
case
because
the
board
said
that
doing
rank-and-file
struck
work
turn
strike
was
conduct
in
the
course
of
representing
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
that
discipline
of
that
type
by
the
union
was
therefore
a
violation
of
section
(8)(b)(1)(b).
this
court
rejected
both
the
theory
as
applied
in
that
case
and
we
most
strenuously
argue
rejected
the
reasoning
as
well.
since
florida
power
and
light,
the
sum
total
of
the
board's
recognition
of
this
court's
decision
and
its
reasoning
in
florida
power
and
light,
is
to
say
that
(8)(b)(1)(b)
is
a
general
prohibition
of
union
discipline
of
supervisor-members
except
for
members
who
spend
a
minimal
amount
of
time
performing
supervisory
duties.
for
everybody
else,
even
if
the
individual
performs
struck
work,
the
pre-florida
power
and
light
rule
continues
to
represent
the
board's
thinking.
so
not
only
has
the
board
ignored
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
opinion
in
that
case
but
we
would
submit
it
to
even
narrowed
the
holding
because
there
can
be
instances
in
which
a
union
disciplines
a
member
for
performing
struck
work
and
in
which
the
board
will
say
that
the
discipline
is
unlawful
namely
a
situation
in
which
he
also
performed
more
than
a
minimal
amount
of
supervisory
activity.
so
even
in
that
situation
we
say
the
board
has
given
very
little
credence
to
this
court's
approach
to
the
problem.
we
think
the
defects
in
the
board's
thinking
since
oakland
mailers
can
be
summed
up
as
follows:
first
and
most
importantly,
the
board
destroys
another
interest
recognized
by
congress
in
1947.
the
interest
that
it
destroys
is
the
union's
right
to
discipline
members
which
by
and
large
was
left
untouched
by
congress
in
1947
and
as
a
historic
fact
in
this
court
has
noted
this
fact
congress
very
well
understood
in
1947
that
union's
disciplined
their
members.
there
is
nothing
left
of
that
right
under
the
board's
theory
as
regards
the
supervisory
members.
we
do
not
think
that
the
board
has
the
authority
to
view
the
statute
as
a
one
value
statute
and
to
say
that
the
interest
protected
in
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
that
of
selecting
a
representative
to
engage
in
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
is
so
important
that
all
other
interest
must
be
denied
and
that
there
must
be
a
broad
prophylactic
rule
which
prohibits
discipline
no
matter
what
its
purpose
and
no
matter
or
whether
or
not
it
is
intended
to
affect
the
protected
interest.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
our
view
on
that
is
that
at
that
point
the
question
becomes
the
union?s
purpose
and
the
board
would
have
to
make
findings
of
fact.
in
the
union's
supplemental
brief,
it
refers
to
this
court's
opinion
and
the
american
ship
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
union
took
that
position.
the
matter
simply
was
not'
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
simply
is
not
my
understanding.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case
here.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
at
that
point,
the
union
is
taking
a
terrible
chance
at
the
least.
if
they
in
fact
perform
a
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
handling
functions.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
accept
that
but
the
problem
with
that
point
in
this
case
is
that
is
not
responsive
to
the
issue
because
we
think
the
question
is
whether
they
perform
such
activities
during
the
strike
and
if
so,
whether
the
union
disciplined
them
for
doing
that
as
opposed
to
performing
other
activities.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
the
situation
of
a
threat,
it
may
well
be
that
the
proper
rule
is
that
the
union
has
to
more
carefully
state
its
intent
than
was
done
here.for
example,
if
there
are
people
who
perform
both
a
grievance
handling
work
and
other
work
for
the
employer
it
might
be
that
the
proper
rule
is
that
union
must
say
we
will
discipline
people
who
cross
our
picket
line
and
perform
non-(8)(b)(1)(b)
work.
i
would
not
argue
that
that
is
a
rule
that
the
board
could
not
reach.
all
i
say
at
this
point
is
that
the
board
is
nowhere
near
having
thought
through
the
problem
to
that
extent
because
it
is
still
taking
the
position
that
whatever
the
individual
does
after
he
crosses
the
picket
line
and
whatever
the
union's
purpose,
there
is
a
violation
as
long
as
that
person
sometimes
handles
a
grievance
and
that
we
believe
is
absolutely
wrong.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
let
me
just
say
that
i
am
here
arguing
for
the
aflcio,
not
for
this
particular
union
and
even
if
i
were
arguing
for
the
union,
maybe
i
would
feel
free
to
disagree
but
i
certainly
do
disagree
arguing
for
the
client
i
am
arguing
for
and?
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
not
sure
what
my
authority
would
be
representing
a
particular
union.
but
at
any
rate,
our
view
is
that
the
board
has
to
find
that
individual
who
was
disciplined
actually
performed
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
work
and
that
the
union
fined
him
or
otherwise
disciplined
him
for
doing
so
and
that
means
in
a
situation
in
which
somebody
crosses
a
picket
line
and
performs
only
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
work
and
the
union
fined
him
the
board's
general
counsel
have
a
relatively
easy
case
to
prove
where
somebody
crosses
a
picket
line
and
performs
some
grievance
handling
work
and
some
other
work
then
you
would
have
the
classic
case
that
you
always
have
under
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
act
which
prohibits
employer
discipline
of
employees
for
engaging
any
union
activity
that
normally
arises.
and
as
i
was
about
to
say
when
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
the
question
that
began
this
discussion
in
the
union's
supplemental
brief,
they
refer
to
the
american
ship
case
and
it
does
seem
to
us
that
that
is
helpful
in
putting
this
section
in
perspective.
in
1935,
congress
said
to
employees,
who
cannot
discipline
employees
for
engaging
in
protected
activity
but
did
not
prohibit
employers
from
disciplining
people
for
breaking
sharp
rules.
the
board
has
never
and
we
believe
that
it
is
plain
they
could
not
say
that
because
employees
will
suspect
that
when
a
union
activist
is
disciplined
for
breaking
a
sharp
rule,
everybody
in
the
plant
will
fear
discipline
that
the
employers
have
lost
their
right
to
discipline
people
for
breaking
sharp
rules.
and
because
employees
both
engaged
in
union
activity
and
to
earn
a
living
continue
to
work
to
the
employer
and
subject
to
his
rules,
the
board
in
an
(8)(a)(3)
case
must
show
not
that
the
person
who
is
fired
or
otherwise
disciplined
was
engaged
in
protected
activity
but
also
that
the
employer's
purpose
was
to
punish
him
for
doing
so.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
situation
the
union
found
itself
and
here
as
i
understand
it
is
that
these
people
who
disciplined
people
did
not
appear
at
trials,
is
that
correct?
mr.
laurence
gold
most
did
not
and
so
the
union
is
left
with
the
situation
that
its
people
are
not
at
the
plant.
mr.
laurence
gold
if
i
may
in
that,
it
may
have
been
the
respondent's
argument
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
i
suspect
that
it
was
his
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
my
view
on
that
is
if
the
union
goes
forward
in
that
way
and
the
people
actually
performed
grievance
handling
activity,
i
think
that
the
general
counsel
by
proving
both
the
performance
and
the
union's
disinterest
has
proved
a
bad
motive.
but
let
us
take
another
case.
suppose
the
union
fines
a
particular
individual
for
working
for
the
employer
and
it
turns
out
that
he
did
not
do
any
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
work
for
that
employer.
i
do
not
see
how
the
union
has
committed
any
violation
at
all.certainly,
if
an
employer
disciplines
somebody
for
breaking
a
sharp
rule
and
it
turns
out
that
that
employee
was
not
engaged
in
any
protected
activity
has
not
violated
(8)(a)(3).
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
as
i
say,
in
that
situation
if
the
individual
in
fact
performs
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
activity,
it
would
be
my
view
that
the
union
might
well
in
that
situation
commit
a
violation.
mr.
laurence
gold
but
as
i
attempted
to
say
before,
that
is
a
general
statement
of
what
they
are
overall
job
description
include
as
mr.
reich
has
pointed
out
at
least
one
group
of
the
disciplined
individuals
here
where
the
story
writers
who
could
not
have
performed
any
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
functions
during
the
strike
because
they
did
not
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
and
because
there
were
no
writers
there
to
supervise
and
handle
grievances.
so,
the
board
does
not
care
at
all
whether
or
not
the
individuals
performed
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions.
it
finds
a
violation
on
a
general
theory
that
if
no
matter
what
the
union
fines
people
for
what
its
interest
is,
what
its
motive
is
and
what
they
have
done
during
the
strike,
it
is
illegal
because
it
may
have
some
effect
on
the
way
that
they
will
carry
out
their
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
handling
functions
in
the
future.
and
what
we
say
is
that
is
just
like
saying
that
whenever
an
employer
disciplines
somebody
for
breaking
a
sharp
rule
that
is
a
violation
of
section
(8)(a)(3)
on
the
ground
that
employees
may
in
the
future
fear
to
engage
in
protected
activity
and
whether
or
not
that
individual
actually
broke
the
sharp
rule
and
the
employer
was
motivated
by
the
breach
of
the
rule.
there
are
many
ways
and
the
board
has
40
odd
years
of
experience
improving
what
motive
is
in
these
situations
where
people
are
sometimes
engaged
in
protective
activity
and
sometimes
engaged
in
a
un-protective
activity
and
you
do
not
solve
the
problem
by
taking
away
under
one
instance
the
employer's
right
to
discipline
which
he
had
prior
to
1935
or
to
take
away
from
the
union
completely
its
right
to
discipline
the
supervisory
members
which
unions
had
prior
to
1947
and
which
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
take
away.
mr.
laurence
gold
your
honor,
in
regard
to
that
we
agree
with
the
statement
made
in
the
union's
supplemental
brief
that
it
might
well
have
been
within
the
board's
province
to
find
that
as
a
fact
if
it
had
inquired
into
the
issue.
but
it
did
not
attempt
to
do
so
and
all
we
can
say
is
that
if
that
issue
would
go
back
to
the
board
for
it
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
threat
had
that
effect
and
it
found
that
it
did
not
have
substantial
evidence
to
support
it,
we
would
not
say
that
the
board
had
not
shown
a
violation
to
that
extent.
mr.
laurence
gold
oh
yes.
i
apologize.
what
i
meant
is
perform
--
would
have
proved
the
case
as
to
those
people
who
would
have
performed
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
during
the
strike.
in
other
words,
if
the
union
threatened
the
story
writers
who
had
no
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
to
perform
and
concededly
so
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
we
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
violation.
but
if
a
union
threatens
somebody
who
was
to
use
an
example
that
mr.
justice
white
has
given,
if
the
union
was
to
say
to
somebody
who
walked
up
to
a
picket
line
and
said,
i
have
been
called
into
adjust
grievances
and
the
union
says,
if
you
do
so
we
will
fine
you.
in
that
situation,
we
would
agree?
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
our
view
on
that
mr.
justice
powell
would
be
that
part
of
the
general
counsel's
case
would
be
to
show
that
the
employer
had
grievance
handling
or
collective
bargaining
activities
that
he
wanted
performed
that
he
asked
these
people
to
do
so.
so,
i
think
that
is
the
first
point
in
case
that
he
must
prove.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
say
that
in
a
situation
in
which
the
employer
says,
i
want
you
to
come
to
work
to
perform
grievance
handling
functions
or
collective
bargaining
functions
as
they
arise,
and
the
union
threatened
to
fine
the
individuals
who
obeyed
that
order
that
you
would
have
an
unlawful
threat.
but
if
the
employer
said,
i
want
you
to
come
to
work
and
do
whatever
i
tell
you
to
do,
then
it
is
our
view
that
the
union
would
violate
the
law
only
if
the
individuals
actually
did
one
of
these
two
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
and
nothing
else
or
that
they
performed
this
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
as
well
as
other
activity
and
the
union
was
motivated
by
their
performance
of
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
to
discipline
them.
so
that
is
the
line
we
draw
--
only
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
we
concede
the
union
can
either
threatened
them
or
actually
discipline
them.
if
they
performed
both
protected
and
unprotected
activity
then
we
say
the
situation
presented
here
is
the
same
as
the
classical
(8)(a)(3)
case
and
the
general
counsel
to
prove
a
violation
must
show
that
the
union
was
motivated
by
a
desire
to
punish
them
for
performing
the
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
or
also
the
way
they
performed.
and
that
would
be
the
line
and
we
believe
that
that
protects
the
employer's
interest
to
select
anyone
he
wants
to
perform
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
and
protects
the
union's
right
to
discipline
members
for
breaching
the
union's
rules
against
working
during
a
strike.
it
gives
each
part
of
this
overall
spectrum
precisely
as
well
as
one
can
judge
congress
believed
or
to
be
given
to
the
employer
and
to
the
union
and
it
destroys
nothing
of
substance
of
either
side.
now
it
is
argued
on
the
employer
side
that
they
do
not
very
much
like
what
congress
gave
them
because
what
they
would
really
benefit
them
would
be
the
right
to
have
individuals
handled
both
grievances
and
collective
bargaining
and
perform
other
supervisory
functions
and
have
those
individuals
immune
from
discipline.
because
it
is
inconvenient
or
expensive
to
them
to
have
somebody
only
just
grievances
or
only
engage
in
collective
bargaining
they
would
like
to
combine
these
various
functions
in
one
person
and
assure
that
that
individual
cannot
be
disciplined
for
anything
he
does.
and
our
view
on
that
is
that
there
are
many
things
we
would
like
as
well
that
the
statute
does
not
provide
us
and
that
there
is
no
way
that
we
concede
in
reading
the
statute
which
would
give
the
employers
what
they
want
without
destroying
entirely
the
other
interest
which
congress
recognized
in
1947.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well
i
am
sorry.
he
would
be
immune
for
discipline
for
his
conduct
as
an
employer
representative.
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
which
?
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
think
so,
i
have
never
even
seen
a
complaint
issued
which
said
that
supervisor
members
even
when
they
handle
grievances
are
immune
from
the
normal
legal
requirements.
our
view
is
that
what
congress
said
was
that
if
you
credit
oakland
mailers
is
that
we
cannot
go
after
them
for
performing
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
or
the
way
they
performed
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
and
what
the
board
is
saying
is
that
we
cannot
do
anything
to
them
ever
because
of
the
supposed
carryover
or
deprivation
effects
and
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right
and
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
the
employers
coerce
the
way
you
deprive
him
of
somebody
who
is
loyal
in
carrying
out
the
grievance
handling
function
which
is
the
oakland
mailers
step
and
is
at
least
a
step
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
if
your
ostensible
purpose
is
far
removed,
you
also
commit
a
violation
just
in
the
minute
i
have,
i
would
say
that
the
board's
theory
in
this
regard
that
no
matter
what
your
reason
for
disciplining
the
supervisor
member
is
you
commit
an
(8)(b)(1)(b)
violation
is
the
same
type
of
theory
presented
to
this
court
in
teamster's
union
v.
labor
board
and
labor
board
v.
news
syndicate,
the
hiring
court
cases
where
they
said
that
any
union
involvement
in
the
hiring
process
through
its
own
representatives
was
per
se
a
violation
because
the
people
subjected
to
that
system
would
fear
that
the
union
would
act
improperly
and
this
court
in
those
cases
said
no
it
is
like
(8)(a)(3)
and
the
board
must
prove
its
case.
thank
you
very
much.
