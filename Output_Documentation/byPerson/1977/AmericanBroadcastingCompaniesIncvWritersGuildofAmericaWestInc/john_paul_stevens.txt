mr.
come,
is
it
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
picket
line
itself
may
have
had
that
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
keaton,
can
i
ask
my
question
about
the
“"a
through
h"?”
you
say
it
is
all
clearly
managerial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
have
described
it?
is
it
also
not
true
that
is
all
clearly
managerial
work
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
selection
of
an
agent
to
do
any
grievance
or
collective
bargaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
he
does
not
get
that
authority
pursuant
to
"a
through
h",
does
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
adjusts
the
grievance
which
he
creates
by
his
own
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
"a
through
h"
activity
is
a
bridging
or
amending
to
meet
the
legal
department’s
objections
or
cutting
or
whatever,
it
is
not
collective
bargaining
or
the
processing
of
grievances,
in
and
off
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reich,
could
i
go
back
to
a
point
you
made
just
a
moment
ago.
you,
if
i
understood
your
argument
correctly,
you
said
that
the
discipline
may
have
been
ineffective
because
some
of
the
people
went
to
work
anyway
and
may
have
been
presumed
they
have
gone
ahead
and
done,
performed
their
collective
bargaining
function
(inaudible)
there
could
be
no
violation.
i
find
that
argument,
unless
i
missed
something,
i
find
it
totally
unpersuasive.
supposing
they
blatantly
said
we
will
find
you
a
$50,000.00
if
you
go
into
the
plant
and
adjust
the
grievance
or
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
the
fellow
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyway.
he
was
not
deterred.
that
could
be
a
plain
violation,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
can
you
test
it
by
whether
the
man
is
in
fact
deterred
by
the
coercion
or
not.
the
test
has
to
be
whether
there
is
coercion,
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
we
are
talking
about
the
deprivation
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
which
you
agree
the
argument
has
no
merit
with
respect
to
the
deprivation
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
restraint
even
though
the
in
fact
goes
in
and
performs
those
tasks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
we
cannot
measure
the
violation
by
the
success
or
lack
of
success
of
the
coercion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
still
do
not
understand
what
your
response
is
to
the
board’s
argument.
you
have
identified
the
board’s
argument
and
you
said
well
they
really
want
to
work,
but
then
you
have
admitted
that
is
not
a
response.
what
is
your
response
to
their
deprivation
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
be
another
way
of
stating
your
theory
that
under
deprivation
theory,
the
board
should
have
made
a
finding
that
somebody
was
in
fact
deprived
from
going
to
work,
that
there
is
an
absence
of
a
critical
finding?
is
that
really
what
you
really
are
arguing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
conversely
there
is
no
finding
there
that
but
for
the
discipline,
somebody
additionally
would
have
gone
to
work
and
adjusted
some
grievances
he
never
adjusted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
your
real
argument,
it
improved
the
deprivation,
prove
actual
deprivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
mr.
come
that
just
the
performance
with
the
supervisory
duty
day-to-day
means
that
the
supervisor
is
representing
the
employer
in
the
administration
of
the
contract?
i
mean,
holding
aside
from
whether
at
any
phase
of
agreement
procedure
he
is
the
employer’s
representative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
include
grievance
adjustment
as
part
of
collective
bargaining
or
in
addition
to
collective
bargaining?
it
is
merely
not
part
of
it,
under
the
statutes
it
says,
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assuming
mr.
come
if
an
employer
refuses
to
process
grievances
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
can
that
be
the
basis
of
an
(8)(b)
5
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
is
collective
bargaining.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
these
fines
had
any
such
effect
in
changing
the
attitude
of
any
supervisor
towards
any
grievance
or
towards
any
collective
bargaining
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understood
that
if
both
'x'
and
'y',
one
is
soft
and
one
is
hard,
both
crossed
the
picket
line,
they
are
both
equally
subject
to
the
fine,
equally
subject
to
discipline
are
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
does
the
discipline
tend
to
make
'y'
act
more
like
'x'?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
other
words,
just
as
much
deterred
on
'y'
as
there
is
on
'x'
and
whether
he
is
tough
or
soft,
he
is
equally
deterred
from
crossing
the
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understood
but
you
are
arguing
on
a
carryover
theory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
employer
orders
an
employee
to
come
to
work
and
to
perform
a
grievance
functions.
that
is
all
he
says,
please
come
to
work,
i
have
got
some
grievances
to
be
settled,
will
you
please
come
and
settle
it
for
me
and
the
employee
crosses
the
picket
line
and
he
is
fined.
and
he
has
crossed
the
picket
line
to
perform
those
duties
and
performs
them
and
is
fined
for
it,
is
that
a
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
says,
please
come
to
work
generally
and
part
of
his
duties
happen
to
be
settling
grievances
and
he
does
them
and
he
does
settle
them
and
the
employee
is
then
fined
by
the
union,
what
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the
employer
says
to
the
employee,
please
come
to
work,
i
may
have
some
grievances
to
be
settled.
come
over
here
and
sit
around
and
if
there
are
any,
i
want
you
to
settle
them
and
he
goes.
nothing
happens,
no
grievances
and
he
come
home
and
he
is
fined,
well
what
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
are
you
saying
that
the
board's
ruling
can
be
set
aside
here
as
was
done
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
leave
oakland
mailers
good
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case,
these
employees
were
told
very
unambiguously
before
the
strike
began
that
they
could
not
resign
during
the
course
of
the
strike.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
a
substantial
difference
in
fact
between
this
case
and
florida
power
light
and
illinois
bell
and
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
general
counsel
at
the
hearing
apparently
took
the
other
extreme
position.
are
you
judging
from
the
colloquy
that
justice
white
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
doubt
you
of
the
authority
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gold,
do
you
agree
that
some
of
the
hyphenates
refrain
from
crossing
the
picket
line
in
response
to
the
union's
prohibition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
he
did
not
pay
his
union
dues,
could
he
not
be
disciplined
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he
is
just
immune
from
discipline
for
performing
the
(8)(b)(1)(b)
work.
as
i
say,
he
did
not
pay
his
dues
or
some
other
neutral
requirements.
he
would
be
like
any
other
supervisor,
would
he
not?
