mr.
julius
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
from
this
court’s
statement
in
florida
power
that
the
conduct
in
a
case
called
oakland
mailers
was
without
the
outer
periphery
of
what
the
labor
board
could
proscribe
or
maybe
at
the
outer
periphery
what
labor
board
could
prohibit.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
right.
mr.
julius
reich
it
may
have
been
out
of
the
periphery.
mr.
julius
reich
it
may
have
been
within,
but
from
the
fact
that
this
court
said
that
it
may
be
within
the
outer
periphery,
the
labor
board
has
drawn
a
conclusion
that
it
was
approved
by
this
court.
i
thought
it
was
questionable.
mr.
julius
reich
but
what
it
is
done
from
that
mr.
bakaly
said
that
we
have
to
start
with
florida
power.
what
the
board
has
done
is
end
it
with
florida
power.
what
they
have
done
is
they
taken
florida
power
and
limited
it
to
its
exact
facts
and
that
is
all.
they
have
taken
a
statement
which
says
that
supervisors
may
be
disciplined
for
performing
struck
work
and
ended
it
there
without
any
regard
to
this
court's
rationale
for
the
decision,
without
any
regard
for
the
legislative
history,
without
any
regard
for
the
statutory
language
and
all
of
that
went
to
show
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
had
a
specific
purpose.
it
was
directed
at
curbing
union
interference
with
the
selection
by
an
employer
of
his
representative
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
adjusting
of
grievances.
now,
this
court
made
an
extensive
survey
of
the
legislative
history
in
florida
power
and
the
board
neither
in
this
case
nor
in
any
of
the
cases
that
fall
in
florida
power
has
gone
to
the
legislative
history
to
see
where
florida
power
should
lead.
in
fact,
what
this
court
said
and
what
the
legislative
history
showed,
is
that
while
employers
may
have
certain
expectations
from
their
supervisors,
unions
too
have
certain
expectations
from
their
members
despite
the
fact
those
members
may
also
be
supervisors
and
in
order
to
give
the
employers
some
relief
from
this
conflict
of
loyalties,
to
help
the
employers
to
resolve
this
clash
of
expectations,
congress
in
1947
simply
took
supervisors
out
from
the
under
provisions
of
the
act
by
section
23
and
also
absolved
employers
from
the
necessity
to
deal
with
supervisors
or
their
representatives
bargaining
for
them.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
right.
the
employers
thus
have
at
this
point
the
ability
to
make
their
own
decision
to
have
their
supervisors
not
be
members
of
the
union,
does
not
subject
to
that
discipline.
now,
the
board
has
come
up
with
two
theories
in
support
of
decision
in
this
case.
one
of
them
is
the
deprivation
theory
in
which
the
board
says
that
if
a
supervisor
has
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions,
that
is
he
has
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
or
the
right
to
adjust
grievances
then
it
is
sufficient
if
the
union
deprives
the
employer
of
the
services
of
that
supervisor
regardless
of
the
fact
the
supervisor
is
not
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
while
he
is
at
work.
now,
with
respect
to
those
who
were
actually
disciplined
in
this
case,
those
were
exactly
the
people
who
worked.
the
employers
were
not
deprived
of
the
services
of
those
persons,
so
they
clearly
were
not
restrained
and
coerced
in
the
designation
of
those
people
who
worked.
the
board
to
overcome
that
in
its
replied
brief
says
yes,
but
they
maybe
afraid
in
the
next
strike
to
work
and
the
employers
will
be
restrained
and
coerced
in
the
designation
of
their
supervisors
in
the
next
strike,
and
therefore,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
act,
but
the
clear
answer
is
that
they
can
ask
those
supervisors
to
resign
before
the
next
strike
comes
up.
mr.
julius
reich
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
language
in
florida
power
is
helpful
to
our
position
and
the
position
is
that
we
have
done
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
selection
of
the
representatives
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
there
is
nothing
in
either
of
the
two
board
theories
which
establishes
that
their
would
be
a
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
julius
reich
well,
that
man
which
mr.
bakaly
mentioned,
mr.
crichton
is
one
of
people
who
is
working.
so
evidently
the
threats
did
not
affect
him
and
in
the
appendix
at
the
8296,
crichton
is
one
of
the
persons
who
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
act
which
indicates
that
he
in
fact
did
work.
i
assume
that
that
is
the
point
that
you
are
getting
at,
that
is
that
--
mr.
julius
reich
okay,
you
are
talking
about
the
blacklist.
well,
that
is
inherent
in
any
situation
where
an
employee
becomes
a
scape
and
fellow
employees
may
not
wish
to
work
with
him.
mr.
julius
reich
well,
it
has
no
connection.
first
of
all
the
rule
was
rescinded
during
the
strike.
so
that
there
was
no
such
mandatory
rule.
an
announcement
was
made
that
people
can
deal
with
him
as
they
wish
just
to
as
in
any
strike
situation,
if
a
person
crosses
the
picket
line
they
suffer
perhaps
the
enmity
of
their
fellow
workers,
but
if
that
is
discipline
then
this
court
has
held
in
cases
dealing
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
discipline
by
unions
that,
that
is
a
matter
for
state
court
concern.
they
certainly
could
have
gone
to
a
state
court
and
get
a
declaration
that,
that
discipline
should
not
be
erased
from
the
record.
so
we
are
not
really
concerned
at
this
point
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
discipline
and
if
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act
to
begin
with
we
do
not
have
to
get
in
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
discipline
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
julius
reich
well
--
mr.
julius
reich
that
goes
to
the
second
theory
of
the
board,
the
carryover
theory.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
right.
mr.
julius
reich
as
far
as
the
deprivation
theory,
the
supervisor
is
there.
now,
if
--
mr.
julius
reich
if
the
threat
of
a
fine
against
--
well,
first
of
all
my
answer
is
that
i
would
concede
that
the
person
who
is
going
in,
who
crosses
a
picket
line
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
grievances,
the
representative
who
goes
in
to
perform
those
functions
that
are
listed
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
may
not
be
disciplined
by
the
union.
it
is
restrain
and
coercion
on
the
employer
to
deprive
--
mr.
julius
reich
even
though
the
threat
is
unsuccessful?
mr.
julius
reich
yes.
i
would
say
--
mr.
julius
reich
well,
i
am
only
repeating
what
the
board’s
theory
is.
the
board
takes
the
position
in
its
reply
brief
that
while
the
threat
of
discipline
did
not
deter
these
people
who
actually
went
in
and
performed
their
services,
and
therefore,
the
deterrence
theory
does
not
apply
in
this
strike
as
to
them.
the
board
takes
the
position
that
in
the
next
strike,
they
will
be
deterred
from
going
across
the
picket
line
and
that
is
how
the
deterrent
--
mr.
julius
reich
well,
now
that
goes
to
the
carryover
theory.
mr.
julius
reich
i
am
sorry.
if
they
are
at
work
regardless
of
the
threat
or
fine
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
employer
has
not
been
restrained
and
coerced
under
the
deprivation
theory.
the
board
may
have
a
good
argument,
if
a
supervisor
is
told
that
he
will
be
disciplined
for
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions,
the
board
may
have
a
good
argument
to
show
that
he
will
be
restrained
and
coerced
or
the
employer
will
be
restrained
and
coerced
with
respect
to
this
supervisor.
mr.
julius
reich
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
people
did
go
to
work
despite
the
threat
and
they
have
adjusted
grievances
while
they
were
there.
we
have
examples
of
stunt
people
and
actors
whose
grievances
were
adjusted.
mr.
julius
reich
there
is
no
such
finding.
mr.
julius
reich
but
one
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
if
a
particular
individual
would
have
crossed
the
picket
line
for
the
purpose
either
wholly
or
primarily
of
adjusting
grievances
and
collective
bargaining
then
it
would
be
a
violation
in
our
view
if
the
threats
kept
him
from
going
across
the
line,
but
we
do
not
have
any
such
case
here.
there
is
no
finding
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
board
says
though
that
the
threat
may
have
kept
people
out
and
that
is
a
violation.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
anybody
who
was
being
asked
to
go
across
for
the
purpose,
either
in
whole
or
primarily
of
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
and
the
board’s
position,
the
board’s
answer
to
that
is
that
so
long
as
the
employer
invests
his
representative
with
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions,
any
work
that
the
representative
does,
any
supervisory
work,
any
work
short
of
doing
rank-and-file
struck
work,
any
work
that
the
employee
would
have
done
would
be
work
which
according
to
the
board,
if
as
a
result
of
the
threat,
the
supervisor
refrains
from
crossing
picket
line
to
perform
his
normal
supervisory
functions,
the
employer
without
more
is
deprived
of
the
representative
he
has
selected
for
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
purposes.
now,
what
this
does
is
to
simply
make
a
shambles
of
what
this
court
carefully
told
the
board
it
should
distinguish.
the
distinction
between
section
211
functions
which
has
supervisory
functions
and
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
which
are
representative
functions.
there
is
a
difference
between
a
representative
as
that
word
is
used
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
a
supervisor
and
the
board
simply
meshes
them.
now,
congress
could
have
simply
said
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
that
the
union
shall
not
restrain
and
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
supervisor
and
then
the
board’s
theory
would
make
sense,
but
it
did
not
do
that.
it
specifically
said
a
representative,
a
representative
for
only
two
purposes
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
footnote
21
of
the
decision
in
florida
power,
may
declare
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
and
there
is
only
one
function
that
of
adjusting
grievances
which
overlaps
between
section
211
and
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
the
board’s
argument
proves
too
much.
there
would
be
no
basis
upon
which,
if
the
court
accepted
the
board's
argument,
that
somebody
with
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions
went
to
work
and
part
of
his
work
was
that
of
doing
rank-and-file
struck
work,
the
board
would
have
to
say
in
those
circumstances
that
the
union
cannot
discipline
him
and
cannot
keep
him
from
going
to
work
because
a
person
with
authority
to
adjust
grievances
is
being
kept
out
of
the
plant
and
that
would
apply
in
the
florida
power
situation
just
as
it
would
apply
in
our
situation.
we
have
a
case
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog
here.
the
result
is,
what
the
board
says
is
that
all
the
employer
has
to
do
is
designate
a
person
as
its
representative
and
that
person
can
freely
go
through
the
picket
line
and
disavow
his
obligations
to
his
union
despite
the
fact
that
he
never
adjusted
a
grievance.
we
have
an
example
at
page
132
of
the
appendix
for
example
of
a
person
who
has
asked
of
one
of
his
supervisors,
who
was
asked,
do
you
adjust
grievances
and
he
said
i
have
the
authority.
well,
can
you
give
me
an
example
and
he
said
i
cannot
think
of
one.
in
the
last
few
years
we
have
had
not
any
disagreements,
but
that
person
would
be
entitled
to
a
protection
under
the
board’s
theory
just
as
well
as
somebody
who
is
there
for
this
specific
purpose
of
adjusting
grievances.
mr.
julius
reich
well,
if
by
struck
work
you
mean
work
which
would
have
been
performed
by
--
mr.
julius
reich
there
was
work
of
the
type
that
might
have
been
performed.
we
do
not
know.
for
example,
well,
i
have
given
examples
in
the
brief
of
the
types
of
work,
polishing
a
script
for
example,
that
is
considered
to
be
"a
through
h"
and
which
is
done
equally
by
writers
as
well
as
these
hyphenates.
mr.
julius
reich
they
were
doing
normal
producer
work,
normal
director
work.
mr.
julius
reich
it
is
writing
but
--
mr.
julius
reich
no,
but
a
writer
can
do
that
also.
a
writer
can
--
mr.
julius
reich
thank
you
your
honor.
your
honor
asked
as
we
departed
whether
the
"a
through
h"
work
was
managerial
work
or
rank-and-file
work
and
in
our
view
it
is
immaterial,
it
is
not
relevant
which
it
was.
the
fact
is
that
it
was
not
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work
and
the
unions
are
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
only
from
disciplining
persons
because
of
their
performance
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work.
now,
we
concede
that
a
supervisor
may
not
be
disciplined
for
the
performance
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work
and
the
question
is
whether
the
threat
of
disciplining
this
--
mr.
julius
reich
any
supervisor
who
is
called
upon
to
do
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work,
hyphenate
or
a
story
editor
or
anyone.
the
supervisors
were
threatened
with
discipline
for
crossing
the
picket
line
and
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
that
threat
kept
the
employer
from
having
present
persons
with
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
functions.
our
reading
of
the
threat
to
discipline
persons
if
they
cross
the
picket
line
in
light
of
the
minimal
amount
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
work
that
they
had
to
perform,
the
example
that
i
gave
of
somebody
who
said
that
it
had
been
years
since
he
could
think
of
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function
that
he
performed,
the
impact
on
a
person
who
receives
a
threat
is
not
that
he
is
going
to
be
disciplined
for
performing
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
duties,
but
they
are
going
to
be
disciplined
for
crossing
the
picket
line
for
performing
non-8
(b)
(1)
(b)
duties
and
there
is
no
finding
here
in
this
record
that
anyone
was
threatened
for
the
performance
of
or
because
he
did
perform
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
duties.
to
conclude,
the
networks
in
this
case,
both
in
their
opening
brief
and
their
reply
brief
had
made
no
secret
of
what
the
case
is
about.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
get
this
court
to
give
to
them
an
advantage
that
they
were
unable
to
secure
through
congress
and
the
court
should
not
do.
thank
you.
mr.
julius
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
excuse
me.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
things
that
were
clearly
stated
in
florida
power
which
this
court
said
to
the
board
it
has
to
consider
and
which
the
board
has
not
considered
and
in
not
considering
it,
the
board
was
able
to
come
up
with
result
with
which
it
has
come
up.
those
two
things
are:
that
first,
employers
have
an
option,
unfettered
option
to
have
their
supervisors
withdraw
their
membership
in
unions,
not
join
unions
thereby
resolving
what
was
said
in
1947
to
be
the
conflict
of
loyalties
possibility
where
a
supervisor
has
loyalties
to
the
union
and
to
the
employer.
and
the
second
point
was
that
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
was
designed
to
protect
employers
in
two
discrete
functions,
collective
bargaining
and
adjustment
of
grievances.
in
order
for
the
board
to
find
a
violation
in
this
case,
it
has
to
ignore
the
court's
rationale
and
ignore
the
legislative
history.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
a
violation.
mr.
julius
reich
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
violation
under
these
circumstances.
in
oakland
mailers,
the
board
took
the
position
that
a
supervisor
who
is
disciplined
for
the
manner
in
which
he
adjusts
grievances
for
the
manner
in
which
he
carries
out
his
supervisory
functions,
that
the
union
violates
the
act
by
restraining
in
course
any
employer
through
such
discipline.
and
under
oakland
mailers
that
would
be
a
violation.
it
would
be
a
violation
if
the
union
restrained
and
if
the
union
disciplined
the
supervisor
for
the
manner
or
because
he
adjusted
grievances.
this
decision
goes
beyond
oakland
mailers
because
the
board
takes
the
position
that
is
not
necessary
to
show
that
the
supervisor
had
any
grievance
adjustment
functions
when
he
crossed
the
line.
as
an
example
of
that,
i
cite
you
to
the
case
of
the
story
editors.
the
story
editors
in
our
case
only
supervise
writers.
this
was
a
successful
strike.
there
were
no
writers
to
supervise.
there
was
no
grievance
to
adjust.
there
was
no
bargaining
for
the
story
editors
to
do.
despite
that,
the
board
proceeds
on
a
theory
that
so
long
as
he
has
the
authority
whether
used
or
not,
to
adjust
grievances
or
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining,
there
is
a
violation
and
we
understand
the
law
to
be
that
the
board
must
come
up
with
evidence
that
the
union
disciplines
the
supervisor
because
of
the
manner
of
his
performance
of
his
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
or
because
he
performed
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions.
mr.
julius
reich
no,
i
would
say
no
fine
in
it.
i
would
say
that
a
discipline
in
that
case
would
be
violation.
mr.
julius
reich
that
is
right.
i
do
not
think
that
this
ruling
has
anything
to
do
with
oakland
mailers
because
the
board
in
this
case
went
beyond
oakland
mailers.
mr.
julius
reich
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
did
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
court
even
has
to
get
to
oakland
mailers.
i
am
suggesting
that
under
the
theory
expressed
by
the
board,
it
is
gone
beyond
oakland
mailers.
the
carryover
which
the
board
expresses
says
that
because
the
supervisor
will
be
deterred
by
the
discipline
on
this
occasion
from
crossing
the
unions
picket
line
and
future
strikes,
the
discipline
is
a
violation
of
the
act
and
i
read
that
on
page
17
of
the
board's
brief
and
at
page
7
note
5
of
the
board's
reply
brief.
that
simply
ignores
what
this
court
took
8
pages
to
express
and
in
florida
power,
namely
that
the
employer
can
avoid
this
carryover
effect
in
the
future
strike
by
requiring
that
the
supervisor
withdraws
membership
from
the
union
or
by
not
having
permitted
him
to
be
a
member
in
the
first
place.
mr.
julius
reich
yes.
mr.
julius
reich
you
are
right
your
honor.
it
is
a
difference
while
i
would
argue.
first
of
all,
i
would
point
out
that
mr.
bakaly
was
incorrect
when
he
said
that
the
rule
was
that
you
could
not
resign
for
two
years.
in
fact,
not
that
it
makes
substantial
amount
of
difference
but
the
rule
was
that
you
could
not
resign
for
six
months
after
negotiations
and
that
was
at
page
579
of
the
appendix.
but
the
rule
was
that
you
could
resign
prior
to
entering
in
to
negotiations
and
so
that
the
employer
have
the
option
before
the
strike
started,
before
the
negotiation
started.
but
i
acknowledge
that
this
case
is
a
little
bit
more
difficult
because
of
that
but
that
does
not
make
any
difference
to
the
board's
theory
because
it
has
found
a
violation
on
the
same
theory
in
other
cases,
one
which
is
presently
before
this
court
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
hammond
case,
regardless
to
the
fact
that
there
was
not
that
restraint
of
resignation.
what
it
comes
down
to
as
both
mr.
bakaly
and
mr.
keaton
argued
is
that
it
is
to
onerous
for
us
to
require
our
supervisor
members
to
withdraw
from
membership
in
the
union
and
in
fact
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
it
was
a
substantial
benefit
to
the
employers
to
have
their
supervisors,
members
of
the
unions.
but
that
is
not
the
line
that
this
court
should
draw.
that
is
the
line
that
congress
drew
and
congress
said
that
the
option
is
with
the
employers
and
if
it
is
too
onerous
then
the
employers
have
to
petition
congress
or
they
have
to
give
something
up.
they
have
to
give
something
up
in
terms
of
negotiating
something
in
the
agreement
or
as
they
did
in
this
case,
what
they
did
was
to
tell
the
supervisors
that
we
will
reimburse
you
for
any
fines
that
you
are
required
to
pay
and
we
will
provide
a
lawyer
for
your
defense
and
that
is
what
has
happened.
our
view
is
that
in
oakland
mailers
the
board
found
a
violation
by
union
discipline
for
the
manner
in
which
the
supervisor
had
carried
out
his
supervisory
duties.
in
the
present
set
of
cases,
the
board
says
that
it
does
not
matter
how
the
supervisor
carries
out
his
supervisory
duties
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
he
in
fact
does
any
supervisory
duties,
in
this
case
we
have
what
we
have
describe
in
our
supplemental
brief
as
non-struck
rank-and-file
work,
that
is
the
a
to
h
work,
but
that
is
not
an
issue
so
far
as
the
board
is
concerned.
any
discipline
for
any
reason,
other
than
performing
50%
rank-and-file
struck
work
is
in
the
board's
view
a
violation
and
that
it
seems
to
us
overlooks
the
second
major
point
that
this
court
stressed
in
florida
power
and
namely
that
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions.
the
two
things
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
and
those
functions
that
are
normal
supervisory
functions
that
are
contained
in
section
211
of
the
act.
now,
the
board
simply
obliterates
the
distinction
between
them
and
does
not
even
allude
to
that
distinction
in
this
court's
decision.
in
this
case,
a
violation
was
found
despite
as
i
have
said
the
fact
that
there
was
scant
evidence
of
any
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
by
anybody
and
no
evidence
of
any
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions
at
least
with
respect
to
story
editors.
as
an
afterthought
in
the
board's
supplemental
brief,
they
state
that
the
employers
were
restrained
in
course
in
the
interim
between
the
time
that
the
union
announced
its
strike
rules
and
the
time
that
the
supervisors
came
to
work,
the
employers
did
not
know
whether
they
would
have
those
supervisors
at
work
and
therefore
their
production
expectations
were
up
in
the
air.
well,
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
point
out
that
the
board's
argument
to
that
effect
was
not
supported
by
a
citation
to
the
record
or
by
a
citation
to
a
board
findings,
i
guess
there
was
not.
with
respect
to
the
threats,
the
board
based
its
findings
of
a
violation
on
the
conclusion
that
since
the
discipline
is
a
violation,
the
threat
is
a
violation.
and
if
that
is
the
board's
theory,
then
the
same
arguments
that
are
made
with
respect
to
the
discipline
are
also
applicable
to
the
threats.
the
board's
brief
goes
on
to
state
the
deprivation
theory
and
in
our
view,
the
deprivation
theory
requires
at
a
minimum
that
at
least
under
oakland
mailers
that
a
person
was
restrained
in
course;
the
person
was
disciplined
for
the
manner
in
which
he
performed
his
supervisory
functions,
a
finding
which
was
not
made
and
which
was
deemed
not
relevant
to
the
board's
theory.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
mr.
gold.
