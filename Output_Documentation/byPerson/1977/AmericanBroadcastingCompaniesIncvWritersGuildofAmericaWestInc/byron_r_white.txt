did
the
court
reject
this
theory
in
the
florida
power
or
not?
justice
byron

white
the
carryover
theory?
justice

or
within

justice
byron

white
you
know
it
is
unsuccessful,
in

words?
justice
byron

yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
only
the
next
strike,
but
just
in
the
future
in
the
ordinary
course
of
conducting
their
collective
bargaining
and
adjustment
of
grievance
functions
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
supervisor,
a
member
the
union
and
as
a
supervisor
crosses
the
picket
line
does
a
non-rank-and-file
work
and
the
employer
asks
him
or
designates
him
to
do
grievance
adjustment,
and
he
says
no
i
would
not
do
it,
i
would
be
fined
and
the
employer
says
well
i
guess
i
must
get
somebody
else
and
he
said
yes,
you
must
get
somebody
else.
now,
with
your
argument
still
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
he
says
i
will
not
do
it
because
i
just
would
not
do
it
because
i
am
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
not
handle
any
grievances
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
crosses
the
picket
line
and
he
does
supervisory
work,
but
when
the
employer
--
and
then
he
tells
the
employer
“by
the
way
i
have
been
doing
grievance
work
for
you,
but
i
am
not
going
to
do
any”
and
i
will
get
fined?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
those
are
facts
of
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
asserted
in
the
present
case,
in
the
briefs
that
the
position
was
taken
by
at
least
one
of
the
respondents
in
that
case
that
the
unions
could
not
permissively
discipline
those
who
cross
picket
lines
in
order
to
perform
what
you
called
211
work
i.e.
just
general
supervisory
work,
performance
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
lawyers
to
lawyers
and
that
was
the
different
case.
you
were
not
trying
to
win
the
case.
now,
you
are
trying
to
win
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
court
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
court
opinion,
it
was
not
a
separate
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
as
supervisor
has
been
performing
the
bargaining
functions
along
with
his
supervisory
duties
and
the
strike
comes
along
and
he
is
a
member
of
the
union
and
the
union
says
do
not
cross
the
picket
line,
he
says
well,
i
really
ought
to
do,
i
have
lot
of
work
to
do,
they
say,
well,
we
will
fine
you,
so
he
stays
away.
the
employer
calls
him
up
and
says
i
got
a
lot
of
bargaining
for
you
to
do
over
here
and
he
says,
i
am
awfully
sorry,
but
i
will
be
fined,
you
better
get
somebody
else
and
you
would
still
say
that,
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
you
would
not,
so
you
can
--
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
has
been
performing
the
bargaining
duties
and
the
union
wants
to
fine
him
from
going
to
work,
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
he
is
going
to
do
his
usual
job.
he
is
going
to
do
supervisory
duties
and
he
is
going
to
do
his
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
just
says,
i
will
come
to
work,
but
i
will
only
do
my
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
employer
says,
well
i
cannot
pay
you
for
that.
you
come
to
work
or
not,
so
he
is
going
to
get
somebody
else
one
way
or
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
either
of
them
if
the
employer
said,
well,
just
come
and
do
your
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
only
one
union
on
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
happens
to
be
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
any
supervisor
has
stayed
away
because
of
the
fine,
he
would
no
longer
be
available
to
do
any
bargaining
for
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
answering?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
when
they
are
different
entities?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
putting
out
of
the
blacklist
or
a
list
of
people
union
regard
to
the
scabs
is
by
itself
violative
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
any
difference
in
the
labor
law
between
creative
people
and
carpenters?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
that
if
the
union
fine
one
of
this
hyphenates
here
for
performing
at
all
a
grievance
adjustment
that
would
be
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
went
to
work
and
part
of
his
work
was
the
grievance
adjustment
but
the
other
part
was
not
but
it
nevertheless
was
not
rank-and-file
so
to
speak
and
the
union
fined
him
for
whatever
he
did,
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
union
here
not
take
the
position
that
you
cannot
go
to
work
without
being
fined
and
no
matter
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
the
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
did?
i
thought
the
union
in
the
hearing,
i
thought
the
general
counsel
or
the
lawyer
representing
the
union
took
the
position,
it
did
not
make
any
difference
what
the
purpose
of
the
person
going
to
work
was,
they
were
going
to
fine
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
is
the
administrative
law
judge.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
hearing
in
this
matter
that
counsel
for
respondent
who
participated
in
the
disciplinary
hearings
instituted
by
respondent
would
testify
that
each
of
the
position
at
such
hearings
that
the
hyphenates
charged
are
subject
to
discipline
for
crossing
respondent's
picket
line
without
regard
whether
they
cross
the
picket
line
for
the
purpose
of
performing
bargaining
services.
now,
let
us
assume
the
union
said,
we
do
not
care
what
you
are
going
to
work
for,
you
may
or
you
may
not
be
performing
collective
bargaining
work,
but
even
if
you
are,
you
are
going
to
be
fined.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
the
administrative
law
judge
making
a
finding.
it
is
clear
and
it
has
been
found
that
the
normal
performance
of
the
hyphenates
primary
functions
involves
the
adjustment
of
employee
grievances,
now
do
you
accept
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
threats
succeed,
they
will
never
show
up
and
presumably
whether
or
not
there
is
that
sort
of
work
to
be
done,
they
will
not
be
there
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
thing
that
brought
on
these
proceedings
was
the
fine.
i
take
it
after
a
proceeding
within
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
the
union's
burden
before
it
can
fine
the
person
who
has
crossed
a
picket
line?
the
union's
position
apparently
in
those
hearings
was,
we
do
not
care
once
you
cross
the
picket
line
for,
we
are
going
to
fine
you.
that
is
what
the
record
shows.
now,
is
the
union
free
to
do
that?
does
it
not
have
some
burden
there
to
show
that
it
was
not
fining
him
what
its
purpose
was?
they
seemed
to
take
the
position
it
does
not
make
it
whether
you
cross
the
picket
line
to
a
just
grievances
or
not
you
are
going
to
be
fined.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
give
you
the
administrative
law
judges
the
second
time
that
he
said
it
in
his
opinion,
it
was
stipulated
that
respondent's
counsel
during
the
disciplinary
hearings
was
not
concerned
with
what
work
the
hyphenates
did
when
working
during
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
description
of
what
the
union's
position
was
during
the
disciplinary
hearings
inside
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
union
fines
him
and
says,
we
do
not
care
what
you
did,
you
could
have
been
engaged
exclusively
in
collective
bargaining
but
we
are
fining
you
and
we
are
not
going
to
make
any
record
about
what
you
did
or
what
you
did
not
do
but
you
are
fined.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
about
this
fining
of
the
administrative
law
judge
that
the
duty
of
this
hyphenates
did
include
collective
bargaining
and
adjustment
of
grievances.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
i
thought
you
said
that
if
a
supervisor
performed
100%
(8)(b)(1)(b)
work
he
would
be
immune
from
discipline.i
think
you
conceded
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
effects
on
the
employer,
(8)(b)(1)(b)
is
directed
exclusively
to
coercion
of
the
employer,
it
does
have
anything
to
do
with
freedom
of
any
employers,
supervisory
or
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
do
with
coercion
upon
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involves
a
strike
by
writers
in
the
television
industry.
some
of
the
union
members
involved
in
the
strike
were
supervisors
and
while
on
their
job
they
also
did
collective-bargaining
work.
these
supervisors
crossed
the
union
picket
line
at
the
request
of
their
employer,
and
while
on
the
job,
did
only
their
supervisory
duties
not
any
rank
and
file
work.
the
union
fined
these
union
member
supervisors
and
the
union
in
turn
was
found
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
national
relationship
board
for
interfering
with
the
right
of
the
employer
to
select
his
own
collective-bargaining
representatives
contrary
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
as
the
board
construes
this
section,
when
the
union
finds
a
supervisor
member
for
crossing
a
picket
line
to
do
only
the
supervisory
work,
including
his
collective-bargaining
duties,
the
union
commits
an
unfair
practice.
this
is
perhaps
not
the
only
possible
reading
of
the
act
nor
even
perhaps
the
only
reasonable
one.
but
the
board
is
charged
in
the
first
instance
with
construing
and
applying
the
act,
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
interfere,
unless
the
board
has
clearly
gotten
off
the
reservation
so
to
speak.
five
of
us
don't
think
it
has
here
and
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
mistakingly
in
our
view,
thought
that
one
of
our
prior
cases,
florida
power
precluded
the
board
from
reaching
the
result
that
it
did.
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
stevens
have
joined
that
dissent.
