i
do
not
know
if
the
record
shows
they
are
engaged
in
collective
bargaining.
maybe
i
have
a
limited
view
of
what
the
definition
of
collective
bargaining
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
to
do
with
negotiating
the
collective
agreement.
justice

but
let
us
take
this
situation.
let
us
assume
there
were
only
half-a-dozen
hyphenates
and
all
of
them
in
response
to
union
rule
and
instructions
not
to
cross
the
line,
refrained
from
doing
so,
at
that
point,
no
one
could
be
sure
i
supposed
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
need
for
grievance
adjustment.
suppose
the
record
was
silent
and
as
to
whether
or
not
such
a
need
actually
arose,
would
there
be
an
8(b)(1)(b)
violation
there?
justice

f.
powell,

well,
he
must
be
arguable
that
management
was
entitled
to
have
at
least
some
of
its
representatives
they
are
to
deal
with
the
situation
or
perhaps
unforeseeable
that
might
arise.
