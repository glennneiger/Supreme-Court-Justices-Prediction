justice
potter

well,
mr.
keaton
that
is
a
very,
very
broad
implication
in
your
answer
to
my
brother
stevens.
any
action
of
any
foreman,
any
time
and
anywhere
in
any
industry
can
lead
to
grievance
on
the
part
of
the
employee
and
is
that
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
not
equally
clear
that
it
is
not
itself
either
a
collective
bargaining
or
the
processing
of
grievances?
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
and
off
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
we
just
assume
that.
justice
potter
stewart
we
may
assume
without
deciding?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
permissible
for
the
board
to
conclude
within
that
language
that
it
was
within
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
conferred
upon
employers
the
absolute
right
to
have
supervisors
who
are
not
union
members
and
not
to
hire
any
supervisors
who
are
union
members,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
short,
your
short
answer
to
the
deprivation
argument
is
there
was
no
deprivation?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
claim
that
the
work
performed
by
these
supervisors
who
did
cross
the
picket
line
during
the
strike
was
struck
work?
you
claim
that
it
was
a
rank-and-file
work,
is
that
it?
it
was
not
limited
to
struck
work
as
was
the
work
in
florida
power,
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
by
other
people
not
by
these
people?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
some
of
struck
work,
some
of
them
was
not,
but
it
was
not
confined
to
struck
work?
some
of
it
was
done
that
would
not
even
have
been
done
except
by
these
people?
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
not
do
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
quite
my
brother
whiteâ€™s
question?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
gold,
i
do
not
remember
and
i
do
not
have
before
me
your
briefs.
in
florida
power
&
light,
that
is
the
respondent's
brief,
but
it
is
asserted
in
one
or
more
of
these
briefs,
if
you
took
the
position
in
that
case
that
supervisors
who
cross
picket
lines
to
perform
211
work
could
not
legally
be
fined
by
the
union?
justice
potter
stewart
and
particularly
when
his
answer
is
only
consistent
with
the
position
here,
that
was
a
different
case
from
the
facts
of
florida
power
&
light?
justice
potter
stewart
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
there
a
collecting
bargaining
agreement
in
existence.
and
if
so,
what
was
the
strike
about?
justice
potter
stewart
to
keep
the
heat
on
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
(8)(b)(1)(b)
says
nothing
about
supervisors.
justice
potter
stewart
no
supervisory
functions.
justice
potter
stewart
a
representative
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances
may
or
may
not
be
a
supervisor
in
fact.
now,
it
is
relatively
coincidental.
justice
potter
stewart
now
would
not
the
board
in
your
submission
also
have
to
fine
that
had
they
crossed
the
picket
lines,
these
hyphenates
would
have
performed
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions?
