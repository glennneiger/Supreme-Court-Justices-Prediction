justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reich,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
argument
you
are
now
making
really
--
you
are
not
helped
much
more
in
it
by
a
florida
power
and
like
than
your
opponents.
you
are
saying
that
florida
power
went
off
on
a
fairly
narrow
ground
and
you
want
to
get
back
to
a
broader
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
position
mr.
gold
as
to
burden
of
proof?
supposing
that
a
supervisor
simply
goes
across
the
picket
line,
the
union
disciplines
him,
does
he
have
to
show
that
after
he
went
across
the
picket
line
he
was
doing
contract
adjustment
or
grievance
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
union
can
impose
a
flat
rule
of
discipline
for
crossing
the
picket
line
and
he
is
got
to
at
least
come
up
with
something
or
the
board
has
to,
before
they
can
show
an
error
on
unfair
labor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
said
that
agencies
may
be
penalized
and
the
weight
we
give
their
interpretation
for
taking
inconsistent
position,
i
have
never
heard
that
rule
applied
to
private
entities?
