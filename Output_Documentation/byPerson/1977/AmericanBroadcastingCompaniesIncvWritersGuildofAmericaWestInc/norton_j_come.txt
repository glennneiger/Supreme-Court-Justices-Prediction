mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
which
by
a
divided
vote
to
night
enforcement
of
the
boards
order
against
the
respondent
union
writers
guild
of
america
west.
three
petitions
to
review
the
second
circuit’s
judgment
were
filed.
one
by
the
board,
one
by
the
three
major
television
broadcasting
companies
and
one
by
the
association
of
motion
picture
and
television
producers.
this
court
granted
the
three
petitions
and
consolidated
them
for
purposes
of
hearing
and
decision.
i
am
speaking
for
the
board
and
will
be
followed
by
counsel
for
the
other
two
petitioners.
this
case
presents
another
facet
of
the
problem
which
was
before
this
court
in
florida
power
decided
in
1974.
there
the
court
held
that
the
union
does
not
violate
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances
by
disciplining
supervisor
members
for
crossing
a
picket
line
to
perform
rank-and-file
struck
work
during
an
economic
strike
against
the
employer.
the
question
here
is,
whether
a
different
conclusion
is
warranted
where
the
supervisor
members
are
disciplined
or
threatened
with
discipline
for
crossing
the
picket
line
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
duties,
which
includes
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining.
now,
the
relevant
facts
are
these.
respondent,
writers
guild
represents
for
collective
bargaining
purposes,
writers,
who
prepare
scripts
for
a
motion
picture
and
television
firms
and
who
are
employed
by
the
major
television
net
broadcasting
companies
and
by
various
member
firms
of
the
association
of
motion
picture
of
producers.
i
refer
to
both
of
them
as
the
employers.
the
employers
also
employ
producers,
directors
and
story
editors
to
manage
and
carry
out
the
production
of
the
films.
the
producers,
directors
and
story
editors
when
acting
as
such,
are
supervisors
as
defined
in
section
211
in
the
act
and
they
also
represent
the
employers
in
the
adjustment
of
grievances
and
in
certain
situations
producers
also
represent
the
employers
in
collective
bargaining.
some
producers,
directors
and
story
editors,
known
as
hyphenates
and
those
are
the
people
that
we
are
going
to
be
concerned
with
in
this
case,
have
writing
capabilities
and
are
at
times
employed
as
writers
to
prepare
scripts
or
perform
other
creative
writing
functions.
these
hyphenates
are
members
of
the
guild.
the
guild
represents
hyphenates
only
when
they
are
employed
as
writers,
not
when
they
are
employed
as
producers,
directors
or
story
editors.
most
hyphenates
have
personal
service
contracts
with
the
employers
covering
their
employment
as
producers,
directors
or
story
editors
and
indeed,
under
these
contracts,
they
are
often
represented
by
other
labor
organizations.
thus
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
guild
and
the
employers
provide
that
a
person
is
not
subject
to
those
agreements
when
he
is
employed
in
a
non-writing
capacity,
for
example,
as
a
producer,
director
or
a
story
editor.
the
agreements
further
provide
that
producers,
directors
and
story
editors
can
perform
certain
editorial
writing
services
known
as
“"a
through
h"”
functions
without
becoming
a
writer
subject
to
the
agreements.
now,
in
march
of
1973,
the
guild
began
a
strike
against
the
employers
in
furtherance
of
their
demands
for
new
contracts
covering
writers.
the
strike
continued
against
some
employers
until
july
of
1973.
a
month
before
the
strike
started,
the
guild
distributed
strike
rules
to
all
union
members,
including
the
hyphenates.
in
addition
to
prohibiting
writing
for
struck
employers,
the
rules
prohibited
all
members,
regardless
of
the
capacity
in
which
they
were
working
from
crossing
union
picket
lines.
the
strike
rules
also
prohibited
union
members
from
working
in
the
future
with
members
who
violated
the
strike
rules.
the
guild
through
a
series
of
special
meeting
with
hyphenate
members
and
phone
calls
to
particular
hyphenates,
emphasized
that
the
strike
rules
would
apply
to
hyphenates
working
in
any
capacity
and
that
they
would
be
subject
to
discipline
and
black
listing
if
they
cross
the
union’s
picket
lines.
the
guild
also
refused
to
allow
any
members,
including
hyphenates
to
resign
from
membership
before
or
during
the
strike.
the
employers
demanded
that
the
hyphenates
continue,
notwithstanding
the
strike
in
the
picket
lines
to
perform
their
duties
other
than
as
a
writer
under
their
personal
service
contracts.
many
hyphenates
crossed
the
picket
lines
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
and
managerial
functions
as
producers,
directors
and
story
editors,
including
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining.
they
performed
no
writing
work,
which
would
otherwise
have
been
performed
by
the
striking
writers.
during
and
after
the
strike,
the
guild
filed
the
internal
union
charges
against
31
hyphenates
for
crossing
the
picket
lines,
10
hyphenates
were
subsequently
convicted
by
union
trial
committees.
they
were
suspended
or
expelled
from
union
membership
and
were
fined
amounts
ranging
from
a
$100.00
to
$50,000.00.
later,
the
union
membership
voted
to
reduce
the
penalties
of
9
of
the
convicted
hyphenates
and
proceedings
against
other
hyphenates
were
held
in
abeyance,
pending
the
disposition
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
which
mean,
were
filed
by
the
employers
with
the
board.
the
board
with
member
fanning
dissenting
concluded
that
the
guild
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act
by
disciplining
and
threatening
to
discipline
the
hyphenates
for
crossing
the
picket
line
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
duties
and
the
a
divided
court
of
appeals
agreeing
with
member
offending
the
night
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order.
now,
we
start
with
florida
power,
which
holds
that
a
unions’
discipline
of
one
of
its
members
who
is
a
supervisory
employee
can
constitute
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
only
when
that
discipline
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisors'
conduct
in
performing
the
duties
of
and
acting
in
his
capacity
as
grievance
suggester
or
collective
bargainer
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
the
discipline
in
florida
power
was
found
not
to
have
this
effect
because
the
supervisors
were
disciplined
for
crossing
the
picket
line
to
engage
in
rank-and-file
struck
work.
indeed
the
union
did
not
discipline
those
supervisors
who
merely
performed
their
supervisory
duties
when
they
crossed
the
picket
line.
the
board
submits
that
when
a
supervisor
member
is
threatened
with
discipline
or
discipline
for
crossing
a
picket
line
to
perform
his
normal
supervisory
or
management
duties
and
they
include
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining,
such
discipline
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisors’
conduct
in
performing
the
duties
of
grievance
adjuster
or
collective
bargainer
on
behalf
of
the
employer,
even
though
the
union’s
motive
is
not
to
influence
a
particular
grievance
or
collective
bargaining
decision,
but
merely
to
secure
adherence
to
its
picket
line.
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
conclusion.
one
is
referred
to
or
can
be
called
the
deprivation
theory
and
that
is
this,
as
the
administrative
law
judge
whose
decision
was
adopted
by
the
board
pointed
out,
if
the
hyphenates
had
succumbed
to
the
guilds’
threats
of
discipline
as
many
of
them
did
and
had
refused
to
cross
the
picket
lines,
the
employers
would
have
been
deprived
of
their
chosen
representatives
for
the
performance
of
management
functions,
including
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
for
the
duration
of
the
strike,
no
less
and
if
the
union
had
directly
pressured
the
employers
into
removing
those
representatives
from
those
duties.
in
short,
the
effect
of
the
threat
of
discipline
would
have
been
to
have
deprived
the
employers
of
their
chosen
representatives
for
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
where
the
picket
line
alone
is
in
the
picture
and
the
supervisor
decides
that
he
is
not
going
to
cross
that
picket
line,
the
employer
is
deprived
of
a
selected
representative
because
of
the
free
decision
of
the
supervisor
to
honor
or
not
to
honor
that
picket
line.
however,
we
submit
that
where
the
supervisor
honors
that
picket
line
as
a
result
of
threats
of
union
discipline,
the
element
of
restraint
and
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
union
has
been
added
and
it
is
up
to
the
union
to
disentangle
that
he
would
not
have
crossed,
but
for
that
restraint
and
coercion,
and
we
submit
that
the
union
cannot
do
that.
moreover,
as
the
board
added
by
the
citation
of
its
earlier
decisions
in
hammond
publisher
and
triangle
publications
in
so
far
as
those
hyphenates
who
defied
the
union
and
were
disciplined
or
concerned
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
discipline
would
have
a
carryover
effect
and
affect
the
future
performance
of
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
functions
because
hereon
like
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
struck
work,
which
was
involved
in
florida
power,
the
duties,
which
the
supervisors
were
performing,
were
similar
to
the
functions
that
they
would
be
performing
absent
the
strike.
i
do
not
want
to
cut
in
any
further
to
my
colleague’s
time.
they
will
develop
these
theories
in
further
detail.
mr.
norton
j.
come
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
florida
power,
at
pages
30
and
31
of
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument,
this
question
was
put
the
union
counsel.
suppose
in
an
employee
strike,
you
had
a
group
of
rank-and-file
employees
across
the
picket
line
and
then
the
supervisor
crossed
the
picket
line
to
supervise
them,
would
you
feel
that
this
made
this
a
different
case?
answer;
it
is
a
completely
different
case.
on
what
basis
do
you
draw
that
distinction?
answer;
because
when
a
supervisor
is
in
fact
directing
the
work
for
us,
doing
what
he
normally
does,
he
is
performing
at
the
very
least,
his
supervisory
duty
as
that
is
defined
in
section
211.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
come,
the
counsel
for
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
not
intending
to
get
a
waiver
or
any
collateral
or
estoppel.
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
in
so
far
as
the
decision
in
florida
power
was
concerned
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
the
question
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
facts
of
this
case
and
indeed
it
was
specifically
left
out
of
the
case
on
the
submission.
i
think
in
terms
of
the
policy
that
went
behind
florida
power,
it
also
made
a
big
difference
that
only
rank-and-file
work
was
involved
because
that
to
deprive
the
union
of
the
right
to
discipline
people
for
performing
that
truly
cut
at
the
heart
of
the
union
strike
weapon
and
in
view
of
the
insurance
agents
and
curtis
in
section
13,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
absent
clear
indication
from
congress
that
it
intends
to
so
limit,
it
is
not
going
to
do
that.
i
think
that
when
you
get
to
the
performance
of
supervisory
work
as
you
had
here,
the
balance
is
a
different
one
and
i
think
that
there
is
that
policy
difference,
but
getting
to
the
last
argument
that
my
brother
made
that
the
burden
is
on
the
supervisor
or
the
board
to
show
that
the
supervisor
was
not
in
fact
performing
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
work.
it
is
not
only
an
unreal
situation,
but
it
is
not
required
by
the
statute
because
the
statute
prescribes
restraining
and
coercing
the
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representative
for
a
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining.
we
submit
that
when
the
employer
selects
a
supervisor
with
those
posts
and
directs
him
to
come
to
work
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
potential
for
exercising
those
powers,
it
is
as
much
an
interference
with
the
employer
selection,
if
you
deprive
him
of
that
representative's
authority,
whether
he
in
fact
was
called
upon
on
a
particular
day
to
adjust
grievances
or
not.
because
in
the
real
world
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
when
a
grievance
is
going
to
arise
or
a
collective
bargaining
situation
is
going
to
arise
and
certainly
a
supervisor
does
not
cease
to
be
become
any
less
the
management
selected
representative
for
that
purpose
due
to
the
fortuity
that
on
a
particular
hour
or
a
particular
day
he
did
not
have
a
grievance
to
adjust.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
doing
struck
work
in
this
case.
there
is
no
indication,
no
evidence
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
am
talking
about
this
employer
and
other
employers
similarly
situated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
we
require
them
to
do
struck
work
then
you
get
into
a
situation
as
to
whether
the
struck
work
that
was
being
required
was
minimal
or
substantial
under
the
board
and
if
it
was
no
more
than
he
would
normally
do
absent
the
strike.
in
some
of
these
situations,
you
have
supervisors
that
do
a
minimal
amount
of
rank-and-file
work
as
well
as
their
supervisory
duties.
if
it
is
no
more
than
that
under
the
board’s
view,
you
would
have
the
same
result
as
you
had
here.
if
there
were
asking
him
to
do
more
than
they
would
normally
do
but
for
the
strike
then
you
would
have
a
florida
power
situation.
i
think
this
case
is
an
easy
case
because
there
was
no
history
of
the
supervisor
is
doing
any
bargaining
unit,
struck
work
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
perform
any
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
employers
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
would
not
require
them
to
do
any
writing
that
was
covered
by
the
bargaining
agreement.
they
were
only
required
to
perform
their
normal
functions
as
producers,
directors,
and
storytellers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
included
some
"a
through
h"
work,
but
the
finding
of
the
administrative
law
judge
which
was
affirmed
by
the
board
is
that
"a
through
h"
work
was
not
bargaining
unit
work.
it
was
not
struck
work.
whatever
you
may
call
it,
it
was
not
struck
bargaining
unit
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
argument
has
validity.
i
do
not
think
we
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
on
the
findings
of
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
each
one
of
these
hyphenates
had
grievance
adjustment
functions
and
they
were
exercised
during
the
strike
because
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
strike
shutdown
the
plant.
you
had
operations.
they
were
filming
these
films
to
be
sure
there
was
no
new
writing
of
scripts,
but
they
were
proceeding
to
direct
and
photograph
and
edit
work
that
was
in
process
and
you
had
other
employees
at
work
whose
grievances
were
being
adjusted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
it
distinguishes
it
from
florida
power
because
in
florida
power
at
least
on
the
submission,
the
supervisors
there
were
disciplined
because
they
went
across
the
picket
line
to
perform
rank-and-file
struck
work
that
they
would
not
have
been
performing
but
for
the
strike.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
not
disciplined.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
say
that,
i
heard
him
and
i
think
as
i
read
his
brief,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
they
have
taken
up
to
now
because
their
basic
position
has
been
the
one
that
member
finding
talk
in
dissent
on
the
board
namely
that
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
under
florida
power,
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
discipline
was
meted
up
for
the
manner
in
which
they
perform
the
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
function.
and
the
position
of
the
board
majority
and
the
position
that
i
am
urging
here
is
that
under
florida
power,
you
can
affect
the
employer
selection
of
his
representative
for
these
purposes,
merely
by
threatening
to
discipline
employee
or
supervisors
if
they
cross
the
picket
line
to
perform
their
supervisory
duties
where
they
include
these
functions
and
it
does
not
have
to
be
for
the
manner
in
which
they
performed
any
particular
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
matter.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
another
facet
of
the
problem
which
this
court
considered
in
florida
power
fours
years
ago.
the
question
is
whether
section
8(b)(1)(b)
of
the
national
labors
relations
act
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
in
course
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
whether
union
violates
this
provision
by
threatening
to
discipline
and
disciplining
supervisors
who
are
also
members
of
the
union
for
crossing
a
picket
line
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
duties
during
the
strike.
now,
the
facts
very
briefly
are
these.
respondent
at
the
writers
guild
represents
for
collective
bargaining
purposes,
writers
who
prepare
scripts
for
motion
pictures
and
television
films.
the
employers
also
employ
producers,
directors,
and
story
editors
to
manage
and
carry
out
the
production
of
the
films.
the
producers,
directors
and
story
editors
are
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
when
engaged
as
such
they
also
represent
the
employers
and
the
adjustment
of
grievances
and
the
producers
also
represent
them
in
some
cases
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
some
producers,
directors,
and
story
editors
known
as
hyphenates
and
these
are
the
people
that
we
will
be
concerned
with
here
have
writing
capabilities
and
are
at
times
employed
by
the
employers
as
writers.
the
guild
represents
the
hyphenates
only
when
they
are
employed
as
writers
and
when
they
are
employed
as
producers,
directors,
or
story
editors.
most
hyphenates
have
personal
service
contracts
with
the
employers
when
they
are
so
engaged.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
guild
provides
that
a
person's
subject
employed
in
a
non-writing
capacity
such
as
a
producer,
writer,
or
director
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement.
the
agreements
further
provide
that
producers,
directors,
and
story
editors
may
engage
in
certain
editorial
writing
functions
called
"a
to
h"
functions
without
becoming
subject
to
the
agreements.
now
in
march
of
1973,
the
guild
began
a
strike
against
the
employers
in
furtherance
of
their
demands
for
new
contracts
covering
the
writers.
the
strike
continued
against
some
employers
until
july
of
that
year.
a
month
before
the
strike
started,
the
guild
distributed
strike
rules
to
all
members
including
the
hyphenates.
in
addition
to
prohibiting
writing
for
struck
employers,
the
rules
prohibited
all
members
regardless
of
the
capacity
in
which
they
were
working
from
crossing
the
union
picket
lines.
the
union
strike
rules
also
prohibited
union
members
from
working
in
the
future
with
members
who
violated
the
strike
rules
and
the
guild
through
a
special
meeting
of
the
hyphenates
and
the
phone
calls
to
particular
hyphenates
emphasized
that
the
strike
rules
would
apply
to
the
hyphenates
working
in
any
capacity.
and
that
they
would
be
subject
to
discipline
and
blacklisting
if
they
crossed
the
picket
lines.
the
employers
on
the
other
hand
demanded
that
the
hyphenates
continue
notwithstanding
the
strike
in
the
picket
lines
to
perform
their
duties
other
than
as
a
writer
under
their
personal
service
contracts.
some
hyphenates
crossed
the
picket
lines
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
and
managerial
functions
as
producers,
directors,
and
story
editors.
they
perform
no
writing
work
which
would
otherwise
had
been
performed
the
striking
writers.
many
hyphenates
did
not
go
to
work.
during
and
after
the
strike,
the
guild
filed
internal
charges
against
31
of
the
hyphenates
for
crossing
the
picket
line
and
10
of
them
were
subsequently
convicted
and
were
suspended
or
expelled
from
union
membership
and
fines
ranging
from
$500.00
to
$50,000.00
were
assessed.
later,
the
union
membership
voted
to
reduce
the
penalties
of
nine
of
the
convicted
hyphenates.
upon
charges
filed
by
the
employers,
the
board
with
member
offending
and
dissenting
concluded
that
the
guild
had
violated
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
of
the
act
by
disciplining
and
threatening
the
discipline.
the
hyphenates
for
crossing
the
picket
line
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
duties.
now
florida
power
holds
that
a
union's
discipline
of
one
of
its
members
who
was
a
supervisory
employee
can
constitute
a
violation
of
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
only
when
that
discipline
may
adversely
affect
the
supervisor's
conduct
in
performing
the
duties
of
and
acting
in
his
capacity
as
grievance
adjuster
or
collective
bargainer
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
now,
the
discipline
in
florida
power
was
found
not
to
have
this
effect
because
the
supervisors
were
disciplined
for
crossing
the
picket
line
to
engage
in
rank-and-file
struck
work
which
is
neither
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
nor
any
activities
related
thereto.
we
submit
that
a
different
conclusion
is
called
for
whereas
here
the
supervisor
crosses
the
picket
line
to
perform
his
normal
supervisory
duties
and
they
include
as
was
true
in
this
case
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
functions.
now,
there
are
two
bases
on
which
we
believe
we
can
satisfy
the
florida
power
test.
the
first
refer
to
as
a
deprivation
theory
and
the
other
is
a
carryover
theory.
turning
to
the
deprivation
theory
first,
we
believe
that
the
threats
of
discipline
restrain
the
employers
in
their
selection
of
a
representative
or
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
no
less
than
if
the
union
had
engaged
in
a
direct
strike
to
obtain
the
removal
of
a
disfavored
foreman
with
such
authority
would
have
done
for
two
reasons.
in
so
far
as
the
threat
kept
hyphenates
away
from
work
and
it
appears
that
about
a
hundred
of
them
did
no
go
to
work.
the
employers
were
deprived
of
their
services
which
included
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining.
in
so
far
as
the
hyphenates
defied
the
union
and
went
to
work
and
about
at
least
31
then
because
there
was
a
number
of
discipline,
the
employers
will
nonetheless
have
been
coerced
by
the
union
strikes
because
the
legality
of
a
threat
is
not
dependent
upon
its
effectiveness
and
the
strike
rules
here
were
in
effect
for
at
least
a
month
before
the
strike
started,
before
the
employer
was
able
to
ascertain
who
would
or
would
not
come
to
work.
now,
in
the
first
argument
of
this
case,
the
union
conceded
that
if
it
had
threatened
to
discipline
the
hyphenates
for
crossing
the
picket
lines
to
perform
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
functions,
it
would
have
violated
section
(8)(b)(1)(b)
irrespective
of
whether
the
threat
was
effective.
it
contends
however
that
the
board
has
not
proved
that
the
union's
threat
deprived
the
employers
of
their
representatives
for
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
purposes
because
there
is
no
finding,
first
that
the
hyphenates
stayed
away
because
of
the
threats
rather
than
the
picket
line.
and
two,
there
is
no
fining
that
the
union
intended
to
find
the
hyphenates
for
performing
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
functions
as
distinguished
from
performing
their
other
supervisory
duties.
now,
we
submit
that
these
contentions
do
not
stand
up
for
these
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
since
the
union
threatened
the
hyphenates
with
discipline,
if
they
went
to
work
in
any
capacity,
we
submit
that
the
burden
is
on
them
under
familiar
principles
of
law
but
this
entangles
the
consequences
for
which
they
are
chargeable
from
those
in
which
they
are
immune.
you
do
not
have
just
a
picket
line
in
a
strike
and
supervisors
electing
not
to
honor
that
picket
line.
secondly,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
union
threatened
the
hyphenates
with
discipline
if
they
went
to
work
in
any
capacity.
they
knew
that
the
employers
had
asked
the
hyphenates
to
perform
their
normal
supervisory
duties,
these
included
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
and
with
the
other
employees
remaining
at
work
as
they
did.
it
was
likely
that
they
would
be
called
upon
to
engage
in
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
and
the
record
shows
that
they
in
fact
work.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submitted
these
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
shows
that
the
producers
when
they
were
on
location
or
frequently
called
upon
to
enter
into
on
the
spot
agreements
to
cover
people
that
had
to
be
hired
to
perform
services.
the
producers
are
the
only
ones
that
on
occasion
were
required
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
the
others
adjusted
grievances
and
the
record
thus
show
that
they
did
adjust
grievances
because
they
were
shooting
films.
there
was
no
new
writing
going
on
but
there
were
prepared
scripts
for
the
strike
and
they
were
being
filmed.
they
had
actors
at
work.
they
had
the
other
people
other
than
writers
and?-
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
statute
does
distinguish
to,
i
think
that
you
could
make
a
good
agreement,
that
the
concept
of
collective
bargaining
as
it
is
understood
in
labor
management
relations
could
in
a
broad
sense
include
the
day-to-day
administration
of
the
agreement
and
in
so
far
as
the
adjustment
of
grievances
under
the
contract
is
part
of
that
day-to-day
administration
or
the
contract
as
part
of
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
an
(8)(a)
5
charge?
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is.
justice
stewart
is
correct
however
that
congress
distinguished
it
in
this
statute.
i
submit
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
separate
the
two
out.
the
collective
bargaining
would
have
covered
the
whole
thing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
were
agreements
covering
these
other
people
who
were
working
during
the
strike.
the
actors
and
the
cameraman
and
the
others
that
go
to
work
that
have
to
be
employed
in
producing
a
film.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
you
have
the
plant
shut
down
and
there
is
nobody
at
work.
i
mean
the
supervisors
merely
go
in
there
to
update
their
records
or
something.
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
keep
the
heat
on.
you
had
a
going
operation
here.
i
would
like
to
and
i
cut
in
further
into
my
colleague?s
time.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
i
would
just
like
to
--
well
on
one
point,
as
it
was
pointed
out
earlier,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
section
(8)(a)(3)
which
describes
discrimination,
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership
or
it
is
well
settled
that
ordinarily
motive
is
a
crucial
ingredient.
we
are
dealing
here
with
(8)(b)(1)(b)
which
prescribes
restraint
and
coercion
of
the
employer
and
it
is
equally
well
settled
that
there
the
test
is
normally
the
reasonable
tendency
of
the
conduct.
now,
the
union
here
as
i
understand
its
position
concedes
that
if
the
union
threatened
a
supervisor
for
going
to
work
to
perform
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
functions,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
(8)(b)(1)(b)
even
if
the
threat
were
not
effective.
the
employer
would
be
restrained
and
coerced
by
such
a
threat.
they
say
however,
that
there
was
no
finding
here
that
the
union
intended
to
discipline
them
for
performing
grievance
adjustment
and
collective
bargaining
purposes.
there
are
two
answers
to
that
contention.
in
the
first
place,
on
this
record,
they
cannot
be
heard
to
make
such
an
argument
because
in
view
of
the
file
examiners
findings
that
mr.
justice
white
alluded
to,
the
union
made
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
indifferent
to
whatever
work
it
was
that
the
hyphenates
performed,
they
were
going
to
be
disciplined
for
that.
and
where
a
union
couches
its
threat
that
broadly
in
a
circumstance
where
the
individuals
involved
are
cloaked
with
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions,
it
must
be
deemed
to
have
intended
to
effect
their
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions.
but
beyond
that
we
submit
that
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
union
intended
to
discipline
the
hyphenates
from
performing
over
on
the
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
functions
because
in
the
real
world,
an
employer
does
not
select
a
representative
just
for
grievance
adjustment
or
collective
bargaining
functions.
these
are
only
part
of
the
representatives
total
functions
and
a
union
assurance
that
a
representative
can
go
in
to
perform
collective
bargaining
assuming
that
you
have
a
representative
as
you
had
here
who
was
armed
with
those
functions
as
well
as
others
that
he
can
only
go
in
to
perform
those
but
if
he
performs
any
of
his
other
functions,
he
is
going
to
be
fined,
he
is
going
to
restrain
the
employer
no
less
than
if
they
merely
said
you
cannot
go
in
there
and
perform
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions
because
no
employer
is
likely
to
hire
only
a
half
management
representative
and
therefore
we
submit
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasonable
tendency
of
the
union's
conduct
and
on
the
facts
here,
the
board
properly
concluded
that
the
reasonable
tendency
of
it
was
to
restrain
the
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representative
for
(8)(b)(1)(b)
functions.
thank
you.
