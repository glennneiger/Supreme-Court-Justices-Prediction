justice

but
what
about
mr.
bakaly’s
point
that
this
man
wants
to
progress
up
the
ladder,
he
is
in
trouble
in
the
future?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
point
is
that
if
he
does
not
participate
here
to
the
full
extent
that
the
guild
wants
him
to
then
if
he
is
promoted
to
another
job,
he
still
can
hold
that
job
because
the
members
of
the
guild
below
him
will
not
work
with
him,
i
though
that
was
his
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
that
disconnect
with
him
on
the
right
to
employ
him
in
a
better
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
has
been
a
grievance
with
another
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
during
that
whole
time,
he
could
be
doing
struck
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
did
not
understand
if
you
limit
this
up
to
this
case,
in
that
broad
statement
you
made
of
the
right
of
“a
employer.”
are
you
talking
about
this
employer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
could
this
employer
require
them
to
do
struck
work
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
all
on
'x'
or
on
'y'?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know?
how
can
you
make
statements
to
all
'x'
or
'y'do
you
not
need
that
to
make
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can
assume
that
the
ones
that
the
union
put
on
are
all
what,
'x's
or
y's?
while
we
assume,
do
you
not
have
too
many
assumptions
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
was
it
done
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
supported
the
findings
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
supported
that
findings
by
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assumptions
that
you
made.
justice
thurgood
marshall
everybody
on
that
list
was
a
'y'
man,
everyone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
not
answer
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
did
they
assume
that
everyone
on
the
list
was
'y'?
