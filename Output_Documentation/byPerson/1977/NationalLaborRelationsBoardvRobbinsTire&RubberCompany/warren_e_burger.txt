chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
robbins
tire.
mr.
taylor,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
you
have
the
honor
of
arguing
what
we
hope
is
the
last
case
to
be
argued
in
the
courts
this
year.
it
is
more
important
to
us
than
it
is
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
be
a
substitute
for
or
an
addition
to
the
discovery
rules
provided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
taylor.
mr.
earnest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
is
when
it
is
fulfilling
the
function
of
discovery
before
trial,
discovery
before
hearing,
but
you
concede
that
this
is,
you
treat
this
as
part
of
the
discovery
function
and
regulatory
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
by
going
into
the
district
courts,
after
an
agency
declined
to
respond
as
requested,
you
acknowledge
that
they
could
hold
up
unfolding
of
the
case
for
a
year,
18
months,
two
years
or
even
more
going
through
the
district
courts,
court
of
appeals
in
petitioning
for
cert
up
here,
it
is
a
possibility,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
you
suggest
you
cannot
bring
out
by
the
ordinary
discovery
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
has
mentioned
and
perhaps
because
it
is
not
relevant,
the
potential
for
retaliation
against
an
employee
by
an
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
not
be
likely
to
do
their
intimidating
in
the
five-day
period,
they
might
wait
a
year,
then
what
do
you
do
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
just
intimidation.
if
there
was
intimidation
which
is
a
possibility
in
a
way
of
prior
restraints
and
retaliation
after
the
event,
maybe
six
months,
one
year,
a
long
time
afterward,
both
of
those
things
are
possible,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
your
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
robbins
tire
&
rubber
company
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
