justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor,
what
do
you
do
with
senator
hart?s
comment
at
the
bottom
of
page
30
of
your
brief,
your
footnote
that
it
is
only
relevant
to
make
that
determination
in
the
context
of
the
particular
enforcement
proceeding.
does
that
support
the
notion,
there
is
a
general
prohibition
against
discovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
by
particular
you
meant
particular
kinds
of
enforcement,
like
labor
board
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
that
interpretation
consistent
with
your
notion
that
the
same
rules
apply
to
criminal
enforcement,
labor
board
notion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
that
congress
did
intend
to
do
by
1974
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor,
do
you
contend
that
if
the
board
should
change
its
rules
to
allow
no
discovery
of
witnesses
statements
even
after
they
have
testified,
the
statute
still
would
not
allow
disclosure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
matter
of
rule
making
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
you
changed
say
a
different
general
counsel
about
the
constitution
is
different
because
the
jencks
case
did
not
apply
to
the
labor
board?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
my
hypothesis
could
not
occur
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
did
not
mean
to
interrupt
you,
you
can
finish
your
thought,but
are
you
relying
when
you
keep
referring
to
senator
hart
on
the
passage
you
quote
at
pages
29
and
30
of
your
brief?
is
that
what
you
say
adopts
the
no
greater
or
no
earlier
access
concept
because
i
surely
do
not
read
that
passage
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
a
disclosure
would
interfere
with
any
one
of
the
number
specific
interests
and
then
later
on
he
says,
where
the
production
of
a
record
would
interfere
with
enforcement
procedures,
this
would
apply
whenever
the
government?s
case
in
court,
a
concrete
prospective
law
enforcement
proceeding
would
be
harmed
by
the
release
of
information
and
in
a
footnote,
he
says
it
is
only
relevant
to
make
such
determination
in
the
context
of
the
particular
enforcement
proceeding
and
you
say
he
is
announcing
a
general
rule
that
there
is
never
to
be
access?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor,
let
me
test
you
once
more
if
i
may.
at
the
bottom
of
page
28,
again
quoting
senator
hart,
?this
amendment
explicitly
places
the
burden
of
justifying
nondisclosure
on
the
government
which
would
have
to
show
that
disclosure
would
interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings,
deprive
a
person
of
a
right
to
a
fair
trial,
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
property,
reveal
the
identity
of
informants
or
disclose
investigative
techniques
or
procedures,?
but
under
your
view,
all
they
have
to
show
is
that
we
have
rules
that
do
not
allow
disclosure.
you
would
not
have
to
show
any
of
those
things,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
they
do
not
have
to
make
that
showing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
thought
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
statute
does
not
use
the
word
prejudice.
it
uses
the
word
interfere
there
and
why
is
not
any
modification
of
the
rules
that
would
otherwise
obtain
in
the
enforcement
proceeding
an
interference
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
if
it
is
a
change
in
the
proceeding
which
it
would
be
if
you
are
getting
discovery
you
could
not
get
under
normal
rules,
why
is
not
that
per
se
an
interference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
answered
mr.
justice
marshall
by
suggesting
that
the
legislature
simply
did
not
consider
or
talk
about
discovery
and
yet
you
are
seeking
they
use
the
statute
for
discovery
and
does
not
the
word
interfere
and
let
us
say
any
change
in
the
procedure
there
is
within
the
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
reading
interference
as
though
i
meant
prejudice
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statutory
function
as
implemented
by
its
own
rules
governing
the
enforcement
proceeding
would
normally
be
no
discovery
other
than
that
contemplated
by
those
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
any
event
you
are
saying
that
foia
intended
to
authorize
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
board
proceeding
and
then
you
were
saying
that
change
is
not
an
interference
unless
it
would
harm
the
enforcement
effort.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
really
a
necessary
reading
of
interference,
it
maybe
a
correct
one,
but
it
is
not
necessary
reading
of
that
word.
it
would
be
if
it
said
prejudice,
but
the
word
interfere
i
guess
suggests
is
a
different
word
or
it
does
not
say
harm
or
prejudice?
