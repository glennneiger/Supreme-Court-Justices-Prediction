justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
board
be
free
under
the
foia
to
go
back
on
its
jencks
act
ruling,
that
is
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
base
that
on
the
legislative
history,
that
is
not
what
the
act
says,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
agency
wants
really
to
frustrate
what
the
statute
seems
to
say
in
its
face,
it
is
free
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
foia
has
not
anything
to
do
with
whether
there
is
a
hearing
or
not,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
it
was
dismissed
it
would
still
be
a
live
foia
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
board
case
was
dismissed?
