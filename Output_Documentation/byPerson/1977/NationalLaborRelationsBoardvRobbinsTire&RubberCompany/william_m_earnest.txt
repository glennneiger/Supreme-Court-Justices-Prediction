mr.
william
m.
earnest
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
issue
here
before
the
court
is
whether
a
government
agency
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
deny
a
valid
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
as
amended
by
giving
a
categorical
per
se
response
of
denial
without
any
meeting
whatsoever
of
its
statutory
burden
of
proof.
under
section
55284
(b)
of
the
amended
act,
the
burden
proof
is
squarely
on
the
government
in
this
case
in
a
de
novo
proceeding.
the
74
amendments
also
provided
for
in
camera
inspection.
there
were
some
substantial
revisions
in
the
74
amendments.
now,
at
the
district
court
hearing
in
this
case
the
board
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
support
its
claimed
exemptions.
this
was
even
after
the
court
reminded
the
board
that
it
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
think
in
the
appendix
on
page
71,
the
board
admits
there
that
it
presents
no
evidence
in
this
case
it
all.
on
page
91
of
the
appendix,
the
court
after
having
reminded
the
board
that
it
had
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
inquired
us
to
the
nature
of
these
statements
whether
the
statements
were
unique
in
any
way,
whether
there
was
anything
unusual
in
these
particular
statements
that
would
cause
an
interference
or
whether
it
was
that
board's
position,
a
per
se
position
here
that
the
giving
of
virtually
any
statement
regardless
of
who
gave
that
statement
or
what
might
be
included
in
that
statement
would
be
interference
and
the
board
accepted
the
later
position
of
per
se
approach.
this
is
of
course
an
approach
that
in
toto
would
exclude
the
documents.
it
runs
contrary
to
the
segregable
portion
added
in
the
74
amendments.
the
board
here
is
claiming
a
blanket
immunity
from
any
turning
over
of
this
information.
this
was
despite
senator
kennedy's
remark
during
the
consideration
about
the
senate
that
there
were
no
blanket
exceptions.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
specifically
exempting
investigatory
statements.
now,
i
think
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
freedom
of
information
clearinghouse,
page
13
of
that
brief
exemption
3
as
i
understand
it
exempts
from
disclosure
a
document
that
would
have
a
statutory
exemption.
there
is
no
statutory
exemption
in
this
case,
although
congress
is
well
aware
that
the
board
and
other
government
agencies
all
have
investigatory
statements.
quite
to
the
contrary
congress
in
the
74
amendments
did
away
with
a
stonewall
categorical
approach
that
had
been
taken.
these
four
cases
that
were
the
dc
circuit
cases
were
illustrative
of
that
particular
approach,
a
blanket
rubber
stamp
type
approach
and
that
was
what
they
sought
to
turn
around.
it
was
a
mechanical
and
wooden
as
that
phrase
has
been
bannered
about,
test
and
congress
was
focusing
here
in
the
74
amendments
with
regard
to
exemption
7
in
particular
on
the
effect
of
the
disclosure
with
regard
to
the
enforcement
proceeding.
would
there
be
interference?
mr.
william
m.
earnest
it
has
not
been
stayed
by
any
court.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
at
their
own
volition,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
in
fact
the
district
judge
hancock
in
the
district
court
specifically
gave
that
option
to
the
board's
counsel.
he
said
?i
can
order
you
to
turn
them
over
right
now
or
i
can
order
you
to
turn
them
over
in
x
number
of
days
before
the
hearing
and
he
says
i
do
think
you
want.
he
says
i
have
the
authority
to
do
either
then
i
will
basically
give
you
choice,
but
there
was
no
stay
as
such
and
in
fact
we
would
be
through
with
this
thing
had
the
board
complied
with
foia.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
foia
has
to
do,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
there
was
an
interesting
comment
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
regarded
to
the
exemption
5
that
the
board's
duty
of
disclosure
or
the
public
interest
would
have
been
met
as
the
facts
were
brought
out
in
the
hearing.
well,
that
is
not
quite
the
case
because
the
document
sought
in
this
case
will
never
be
brought
out
to
the
public
in
the
hearing.
they
are
produced
to
the
person
in
litigation
with
the
agency
only
upon
request
and
they
are
retrieved
by
the
board
after
that
there
is
no
opportunity
to
make
a
copy.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
you
can
go
after
them
any
time
with
foia.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
suspect
we
would
see
the
same
exemptions
we
have
got
now
because
the
board
has
i
think
taken
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
they
have
taken
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
they
have
taken,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
have
taken
the
position
that
even
a
closed
file
could
interfere
with
future
enforcement
proceedings
or
could
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
they
would.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
do
not
think
they
will
be
successful
in
this.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
had
a
personal
use
of
that
and
we
are
a
member
of
the
public.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
but
another
member
of
the
public
may
have
a
different
purpose
and
i
do
not
know
that
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
upon
proper
request,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
but
not
to
keep.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
what
congress
had
in
mind,
i
think
this
has
been
clear
from
the
decisions,
was
it
there
would
be
maximum
possible
disclosure
together
with
a
very
narrow
construction
of
the
exemptions
and
of
course
the
board?s
position
is
that
nothing
has
been
changed
by
the
74
amendments.
the
statute
i
think
is
clear
that
there
must
be
proof
of
such
effect.
if
in
fact
there
is
such
effect
then
there
is
such
proof
and
each
agency,
there
was
some
discussion
here
earlier
about
how
the
act
would
apply
to
different
agencies.
well,
i
think
that
i
can
apply
to
different
agencies
and
there
can
be
consideration
of
withholding
of
documents
by
those
various
agencies
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
interference
with
that
particular
agency's
particular
needs.
the
nlrb
has
particular
concerns
and
one
of
which
that
is
voiced
is
the
employer-employee
relationship,
but
sec
also
has
particular
concerns.
every
other
agency,
osha
and
to
the
extent
that
those
concerns
are
valid
concerns
they
are
capable
of
proof.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
very
much
disagree
with
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
has
said,
i
do
not
think
he
went
quite
as
far
to
say
as
that
it
would
end
up
in
district
court,
but
he
said
every
board
case
would
be
a
foia
case.
quite
frankly,
the
foia
case
should
not
even
get
to
the
district
court.
the
agency
ought
to
do
the
request.
it
first
goes
to
the
agency
and
as
appeal
within
the
agency
so
the
district
court
should
never
even
have
to
fool
with
it.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
if
the
agency
complies.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
a
case
in
point
might
be
the
advice
and
appeals
memorandum
that
was
considered
by
this
court
in
sears.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct,
but
if
doing
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
is
going
under,
i
do
not
consider
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
i
do.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
it
would.
there
is
no
assurance
and
i
think
congress
realized
this
at
the
time
when
it
enacted
the
law,
but
i
think
it
is
congress?
intent
to
have
the
district
court
consider
that
when
there
was
a
true
controversy.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no
i
am
not.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
it
smells
of
discovery,
okay,
but
i
think
the
two
actions
are
separate
and
i
think
that
the
rules
are
equally
applicable
to
all
agencies.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
could
get
them
after.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
probably
not.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
my
preference
would
be
to
have
them
before
but
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
to
resolve
credibility
issues
in
this
case
which
is
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
in
that
respect,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no,
it
is
not
a
case
of
curiosity.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no,
i
think
congress
was
intending
in
having
agencies
operate
with
openness
and
that
to
the
extent
that
their
processes
would
be
interfered
with
that
they
were
entitled
to
withhold
that
information.
i
think
that
if
there
is
such
interference
then
the
best
person
in
the
world
to
show
that
is
the
agency
and
i
think
there
must
be
proof
of
that.
i
think
the
statutory
language
is
clear.
with
regard
to
your
question
about
that
would
i
want
these
statements
after
the
hearing,
i
cannot
recall
specific
senators
or
congressmen
involved,
but
there
is
very
adequate
legislative
history
backing
for
that
information
is
really
only
worthwhile
if
it
is
received
timely
and
for
my
particular
purpose
it
maybe
only
valuable
to
me
if
it
is
timely.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
would
wind
up
with
the
same
document
whether
you
get
it
under
a
discovery
or
whether
you
go
under
foia,
but
all
i
am
saying
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there
is
a
discovery
proceeding
there
or
not.
i
am
squarely
contrary
to
the
board
or
any
government
agency
that
takes
the
position
that
its
discovery
procedures
govern
them
of
what
is
disclosable
under
foia
because
if
that
be
the
case
then
all
an
agency
need
do
to
get
around
foia
is
just
adopt
a
policy
of
non-disclosure
and
you
have
in
foia
is
of
no
effect.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
under
foia,
again
it
would
get
back
to
a
showing
of
interference.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
am
not
really
a
criminal
lawyer
so
i
am
not
really
speaking
from
a
good
basis
on
that,
but
i
do
feel
that
foia
is
a
separate
statute
apart
from
other
statutes
and
there
exists
the
availability
of
information
under
foia.
i
think
there
are
built
in
limitations
within
foia
without
having
to
rely
on
the
other
statutes
and
that
as
matter
of
proof
any
interference
or
something
per
se
that
is
exempted
and
i
believe
in
the
exemption
7
there
is
under
i
guess
is
its
confidentiality
that
there
is
a
special
provision
in
there
concerning
fbi.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
are
you
not
getting
into
this
comparative
discovery
test
that
the
first
circuit
spoke
off
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
foia
act
intended
to
amend
an
agency?s
discovery
rules.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
do
not
see
interference
as
that,
no.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
read
interference
as
keeping
the
government
agency
from
performing
its
statutory
function.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
may
not
agree
and
do
not
agree
that
the
board?s
discovery
rules
are
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
its
statutory
function.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
loser
rule
from
the
board
point
of
view
would
aid
them
in
carrying
out
that
function.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
the
legislative
history
talks
in
terms
of
interference,
but
also
with
the
word
harm.
i
do
not
recall
the
word
prejudice
being
bannered
about.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
foia
is
independent.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
including
them
as
either.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
it
is
a
possibility,
yes
sir,
but
it
is
also
a
possibility
too
that
i
would
do
my
client
a
great
service
by
bringing
out
facts
of
credibility
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
ordinary
discovery
proceedings
under
the
board,
no.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
if
i
requested
them
yes,
but
i
would
have
approximately
five
to
10
minutes
and
i
work
for
the
board
so
i
am
aware
of
this
that
i
would
have
approximately
five
to
10
minutes
to
review
those
statements
and
in
those
statements,
could
be
listed
the
names
of,
and
we
have
credibility
in
this
situation
of
corroborating
witnesses,
some
of
whom
may
or
may
not
be
employees,
i
would
have
no
opportunity
to
go
check
that
out.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
may
i
address
myself
that
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
it
is
a
possibility,
yes,
sir.
as
i
am
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
from
its
earlier
decision
that
884
protects
such
a
witness.
in
fact,
it
gives
him
greater
protection
that
he
would
have
if
this
disclosure
had
not
been
made,
the
company
would
be
put
on
notice
of
knowledge
of
who
such
people
were
and
what
was
contained
in
those
statements
and
if
something
were
done
as
within
this
case
which
was
a
five-day
period,
something
were
done
to
that
witness,
some
sort
of
intimidation,
that
certainly
would
be
brought
out
at
a
trial.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
do
not
think
you
ever
have
any
assurance
that
someone
will
not
obey
the
law,
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
has
been
any
disobeying
of
the
law
of
this
client
that
the
disclosure
at
the
hearing
or
part
of
the
hearing
would
have
no
effect
if
the
employer
or
union
involved
were
going
to
discriminate
against
an
employee
or
intimidate
for
that
whether
it
is
after
the
hearing
or
before
the
time,
makes
no
difference
there.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
do
not
have
that
right
under
board
proceedings.
in
fact
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
think
that
any
type
of
discovery
would
have
to
go
through
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
with
the
general
counsel?s
approval
and
that
effectively
is
none.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
excuse
me,
who
is
the
second?
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
i
think
if
the
concern
has
been
brought
forth
as
to
whether
there
would
be
intimidation,
that
intimidation
could
be
brought
about
by
a
union
as
well
as
by
an
employer.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no,
my
request
was
limited
to
just
the
statements
of
witnesses.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
a
question
that
was
not
addressed.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
one
of
the
defense
i
think
to
the
board
of
that
is
that
there
was
a
breech
of
confidentiality
or
a
breech
of
privacy
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
i
do
not
agree
that
a
board
bootstrap
promise
of
confidentiality
is
sufficient
to
insulate
that
disclosure.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
only
those
people
and
only
that
they
be
disclosed
after
the
investigation
was
complete.
i
had
not
desire
to
interfere
with
the
investigation.
we
cooperated
with
the
board
100%.
we
produced
our
witnesses,
let
them
take
statements
of
our
witnesses.
we
opened
our
files,
our
documents
and
let
them
copy.
they
have
seen
our
cards
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
discussed
either
in
briefs
or
in
the
general
cases
that
have
been
decided
is
whether
or
not
it
would
be
frustration
of
the
proceedings
as
far
as
construction
of
the
defenses,
we
have
shown
our
hand
already
on
that.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
we
did.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
mr.
justice
powell,
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
i
have
worked
for
the
board
and
i
believe
that
the
board
law
is
a
good
law
and
my
personal
belief
is
that
the
board
law,
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
best
implemented
when
you
have
cooperation.
i
do
not
believe
that
holding
cards
close
to
your
chest
and
going
to
a
hearing
for
the
sake
of
going
to
a
hearing
really
effectuates
the
law.
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
william
m.
earnest
it
might
be
an
affected
issue.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
yes,
generally
it
does
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
probably
i
would
say
within
the
maybe
five
or
six
years,
it
maybe
be
only
two
cases,
have
i
not
presented
evidence.
now,
that
is
not
a
procedure
that
is
necessarily
followed
by
all
labor
attorneys
representing
management.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
that
is
correct.
the
board
has
the
investigatory
authority
and
they
can
subpoena
my
witnesses,
my
records,
but
i
think
the
thing
is
best
resolved
in
administrative
give
and
take
process
and
not
where
you
are
having
any
type
of
formal
proceeding.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
well,
i
do
not
know
that
they
disagree
with
me
on
that.
i
think
that
is
their
preferred
method
and
i
think
it
is
the
best
method.
i
think
openness
is
the
best
method.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
no,
they
have
not
been.
mr.
william
m.
earnest
one
thing
i
would
particularly
like
to
note
is
the
fourth
circuit?s
decision
in
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
hospital
case.
the
fourth
circuit
was
the
circuit
that
decided
the
wellman
industries
case
which
is
one
of
those
that
was
pre-amendment.
the
fourth
circuit
having
looked
at
the
74
amendments
i
think
has
changed
its
mind
about
its
earlier
decision
and
that
is
of
the
opinion
that
they
would
proceed
forward
on
case
by
case
basis.
with
regard
to
the
exemption
5
raised
by
the
board,
i
do
not
think
that
one
of
these
statements
are
memoranda
or
letters.
i
think
such
a
document
is
the
type
of
document
that
would
be
a
statement
of
an
agency,
employees,
his
own
statement
as
opposed
to
someone
outside
the
agency.
