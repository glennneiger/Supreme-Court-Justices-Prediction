justice

i
think
the
question
however
was
is
that,
is
it
your
contention
that
whatever
discovery
the
board
permissibly
allows,
that
is
permissible
outside
of
the
foia,
foia
does
not
require
disclosure
of
--

so
the
board
if
it
wanted
to
change
its
rules
and
assuming
it
permissibly
could
to
provide
even
less
discovery
that
it
now
does
that
would
be
it

exemption
7?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
have
the
case
here
though
where
your
whole
exemption
claim
is
based
upon
the
proposition
that
disclosure
of
the
information
would
interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
your
discovery
rules
were
promulgated
upon
the
proposition
that
they
are
necessary
to
prevent
interference
with
enforcement
proceedings.
that
that
is
enough,
just
show
what
your
rules
are
and
what
the
basis
and
justification
for
the
rules
are?
justice
potter
stewart
these
rules
are
based
upon
that
general
possibility
of
disruption
of
enforcement
proceedings
and
that
those
are
the
rules
so
based
and
so
justified
and
that
the
foia
does
not
provide
for
an
individualized
determination
whether
in
any
particular
enforcement
proceeding,
there
would
be
a
disruption?
