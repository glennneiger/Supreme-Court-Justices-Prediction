unknown
speaker
its
primary
concern
was
to
undo
the
decisions
of
the
court
that
had
read
the
exemption
broadly
as
including
anything
that
had
ever
been
prepared
generically
in
connection
with
any
enforcement
proceeding,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
that
the
amendment
is
not
a
radical
departure
from
existing
case
law
so
it
is
some
departure
from
existing
case,
but
he
says
the
approach
is
in
keeping
with
the
intent
of
congress
and
by
this
amendment,
we
wish
to
reinstall
it
as
a
basis
for
accessed
information?
unknown
speaker
mr.
earnest,
you
did
not
make
your
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
for
the
purpose
of
public
dissemination?
unknown
speaker
if
you
win,
the
public
would
not
necessarily
benefit
except
derivatively
if
this
is
the
public
purpose
of
the
act.
you
made
your
request
for
you
so
as
to
litigate
this
labor
board
proceeding,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
your
purpose
was
to
get
this
information
for
your
use
as
a
lawyer
or
representing
the
employer
in
that
labor
board
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
board's
rules
after
witness
has
testified
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
entitled
to
any
statements
he
has
made.
unknown
speaker
upon
proper
request
and
you
are
entitled
to
him
as
a
lawyer
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
not
to
disseminate
to
the
public
either?
unknown
speaker
on
one
side
knuckles
under
there
was
never
a
judicial
controversy,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can
see
that
in
a
given
particular
case
there
could
be
justification
for
the
agency
to
assert
claim
under
exemption
number
7?
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
certainly
would
leave
room
for
judicial
controversy
in
any
particular
case,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
nlrb
says
there
should
be
a
per
se
exemption
under
exemption
number
7
of
the
statements.
you
are
not
on
the
other
side
arguing
that
there
should
be
per
se
disclosure,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
plea
is
it
the
foia
impose
certain
duties
upon
the
agencies
without
regard
or
respect
to
there
preexisting
rules?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
would
change
them
or
maybe
it
would
not,
but
it
impose
statutory
duties
on
the
agencies
and
that
their
preexisting
rules
of
discovery
are
basically
irrelevant
to
those
duties?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
object
to
statements
after
the
witness
testified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
earnest,
you
would
like
to
get
not
just
the
statements
of
witnesses,
but
the
statements
of
anybody
that
bear
on
the
case
i
think?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
you
could
get
these,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
statements
that
the
board
has
taken
of
people
they
do
not
intend
to
call
as
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
i
cannot
imagine
any
difference
in
principle.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
a
witness
gives
a
board
a
statement
under
the
board?s
agreement
to
keep
it
confidential,
you
could
not
get
it?
unknown
speaker
but
your
request
was
for
the
previous
statements
of
people
who
were
going
to
testify
at
the
hearing
and
only
those
people?
unknown
speaker
that
is
might
not
serve
your
client
of
being
open
and
showing
your
cards.
i
take
it
you
feel
that?
