justice
thurgood
marshall
it
excludes
you
from
the
act
and
tells
you
to
go
your
regular
discovery
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
congress
could
have
said
that
very
easily,
just
that
way
and
it
did
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
congress
says
in
any
place
that
this
does
not
apply
to
nlrb
investigation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
question
was
that
congress
could
have
said
the
foia
does
not
apply
to
nlrb
and
they
did
not
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
not
go
after
them
again
under
foia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
you
not
be
successful
then?
what
exemption
could
they
plead
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
they
could
say
it
is
after.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
have
had
issued
that
especially
for
this
particular
case.
they
could
not
just
take
blanket
one
you
call
wooden,
they
could
not
take
the
wooden
approach
then,
could
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
be
successful.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
your
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
intended
that
it
should
be
used
in
lieu
of
discovery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
what
you
want
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
two
actions
are
separate,
you
can
get
these
after
the
hearing
and
that
you
do
not
want
them
afterwards.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
not
want
them
afterwards,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
record
shows
you
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
before
instead
of
after?
justice
thurgood
marshall
foia
discovery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
other
respect
is
there,
curiosity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
is
what
congress
was
interested
in
for
your
curiosity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
following
a
contested
representative
elections
in
national
labor
relations
board,
scheduled
a
hearing
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
against
the
respondent
company.
the
respondent
requested
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
the
board
disclosed
statements
of
potential
witnesses
prior
to
the
hearing.
the
board
denied
this
request,
claiming
that
the
act
permitted
it
to
withhold
such
statements.
it
relied
particularly
on
a
provision
known
as
exemption
7
(a)
which
permitted
government
agencies
to
withhold
investigatory
records
compiled
for
the
law
enforcement,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
their
production
would
interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings.
respondent
sued
the
board
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
northern
district
of
alabama
which
court
upheld
the
request
for
the
witnesses'
statements
and
rejected
the
board's
claim
basis
for
non-disclosure.
on
the
board's
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
that
court
held
that
exemption
7
(a)
was
not
available
to
the
board
because
it
had
not
made
a
showing
that
is
the
board
had
not
made
a
showing,
that
the
particular
witnesses
in
this
proceeding
would
be
intimidated
by
the
pre-hearing
release
of
their
earlier
statements.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
material
sought
by
respondents
is
indeed
exempt
from
mandatory
disclosure
and
exemption
7
(a)
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
support
our
conclusion.
for
example,
congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
the
court
from
determining
that
as
a
general
matter,
the
disclosure
of
certain
kinds
of
documents
in
certain
kinds
of
enforcement
proceedings
would
"interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings"
within
the
meaning
of
exemption
7.
when
congress
first
passed
the
freedom
of
information
act
it
was
particularly
concerned
that
the
act
not
be
used
to
compel
disclosure
where
there
are
statements
involving
proceedings
prior
to
when
they
testified
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
hearing.
the
courts
had
uniformly
so
interpreted
the
1966
act.
there
is
no
indication
that
when
congress
amended
the
act
in
1974,
it
intended
to
override
it's
own
earlier
policy
on
these
cases.
and
the
danger
is
likely
to
occur
from
pre-hearing
release
of
these
documents
including
intimidation
of
witnesses
do
in
fact
impose
a
likelihood
of
interference
with
enforcement
proceeding.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
to
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
