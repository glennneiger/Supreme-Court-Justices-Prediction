justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor,
i
spent
three
years
in
the
executive
branch
and
resolutely
adhere
to
juxtaposition
that
you
are
taking
now
and
i
thought
was
right
then
in
doing
it,
i
have
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
after
the
1974
amendments
where
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
just
plowed
ahead
and
said
that
that
is
what
they
meant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
compared
the
house
history
of
the
bill
of
the
66
act
with
the
senate
history?
it
looks
like
you
are
talking
about
two
entirely
different
bills?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
either
in
66
or
74
which
suggests
the
labor
board
is
different
from
osha
or
different
from
the
ftc
or
different
from
any
other
agency,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
we
were
to
adopt
that
position,
that
is
not
a
complete
answer
to
judge
godbolt's
opinion
in
this
case,
is
it,
because
he
concluded
that
the
disclosure
would
not
really
interfere
with
the
enforcement
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
not
subject
to
case
by
case
determination.
it
is
just
a
generic
type
of
rule
laid
down
by
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
good
does
foia
do
in
these
cases,
if
it
simply
matches
the
discovery
rules
that
already
exist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
take
you
language
out
of
exemption
7,
investigatory
records
compiled
for
a
law
enforcement
purposes
and
then
you
have
i
believe
your
74
amendment,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
the
production
of
such
records
would
interfere
with
enforcement
proceeding.
does
that
not
suggest
some
sort
of
a
case
by
case
or
some
sort
of
a
balancing
approach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
second
circuit
changes
its
mind?
supposing
the
second
circuit
had
not
said
that
the
jencks
rules
should
apply
in
nlrb
cases,
would
the
board
be
freed
by
rules
so
far
as
foia
is
concerned
to
say
no
jencks
act
disclosure
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
not
based
on
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
an
agency
respond
to
an
foia
claimant?s
request
that
the
public
interest
in
your
request
will
be
served
when
two
years
from
now,
we
announce
our
conclusions
on
this
subject
and
so
wait
till
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
request
had
been
six
months
before
the
case
has
gone
where
it
gone?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
really
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
two
years
or
six
months
or
five
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
mr.
earnest
this
proceeding
has
simply
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
ruling
under
foia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean
the
nlrb
has
declined
to
proceed
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right,
so
there
is
no
question
of
mootness
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
every
one
of
them
as
your
opponent
suggests
it
is
going
to
end
up
in
the
federal
district
court
before
you
have
the
agency
proceeding
under
a
foia
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
agency
complies
with
the
request?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
gather
from
your
opponents
position
that
the
nlrb
is
not
about
to
comply
without
being
told
to
comply
by
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
some
is
clearly
not
disclosable
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
do
you
think
that
a
criminal
defendant
could
go
into
the
district
court
where
the
criminal
case
is
pending
or
another
district
court
and
ask
for
it
under
foia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
in
every
single
criminal
case
that
a
separate
case
could
be
brought
deciding
whether
or
not
discovery
over
and
above
that
provided
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
would
interfere
with
the
prosecution's
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
in
every
single
criminal
prosecution
the
defense
lawyer
could
start
separate
litigation
under
foia
saying
?i
know
i
am
not
entitled
to
this
information
by
way
of
discovery
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
but
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
it
under
foia
and
then
a
separate
case
would
then
go
onperhaps
within
the
criminal
department
of
the
justice
division,
perhaps
in
a
district
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecution's
case
would
be
prejudiced
by
disclosure
of
that
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
agency
to
make
use
of
each
exemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
the
united
states
as
a
civil
litigant
or
the
united
states
as
a
criminal
prosecutor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
is
your
answer
yes
or
no
to
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
board
is
authorized
to
enforce
subpoenas
if
you
are
unwilling,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
board
disagrees
with
you,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
have
not
been
open
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
it
thought
they
disagreed
with
you
in
this
case.
