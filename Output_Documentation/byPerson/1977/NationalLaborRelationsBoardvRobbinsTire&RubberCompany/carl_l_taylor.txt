mr.
carl
l.
taylor
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
never
intended
to
be
a
new
and
superior
set
of
discovery
rules
to
supersede
and
override
the
balance
struck
within
existing
discovery
rules
and
to
provide
a
vehicle
for
enjoining
trials
and
hearing
are
pending
for
litigation.
the
fifth
circuit
itself
from
whence
this
case
comes
has
emphasized
this
principle
with
respect
to
criminal
litigation
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
murdock
which
is
cited
in
the
robbins
case
itself
in
footnote
19.
the
court
notes
that
when
it
was
previously
faced,
earlier
last
year
with
a
foia
demand
in
a
criminal
context,
it
held
and
i
quote,
?we
find
that
foia
was
not
intended
as
a
device
to
delay
ongoing
litigation
or
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
discovery
beyond
that
already
provided
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.?
the
fifth
circuit
has
attempted
to
distinguish
murdock
on
the
ground
that
the
special
dangers
inherent
in
upsetting
the
discovery
balance
in
a
criminal
prosecution
are
so
compelling
that
congress
could
not
have
possibly
intended
such
a
result,
but
in
the
case
at
bar
by
contrast,
enlarging
the
scope
of
discovery
in
labor
proceedings
will
have
a
salutary
effect
upon
the
board?s
procedures.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
statute
speaks
of
enforcement
proceedings
without
distinguishing
between
particular
types
of
enforcement
proceedings
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
applies
to
an
enforcement
proceeding
applies
to
all
equally
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
bears
me
out
on
that.
if
we
go
back
to
the
1966
bill,
the
original
act
and
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
what
was
intended
initially
by
wxemption
7
and
then
trace
it
through
the
1974
amendment
--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
bill
of
course,
came
up
in
the
senate
first
and
what
is
key
in
the
senate
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
the
participation
of
senator
humphrey
who
specifically
protested
during
the
debates
in
the
senate
that
the
act
might
be
used
to
obtain
statements
of
witnesses
prior
to
hearing
in
labor
board
proceedings
is
specifically
addressed
to
labor
board.
he
expressed
the
fear
and
a
quote
?that
witnesses
would
be
loathe
to
give
statements
if
they
knew
that
their
statements
were
going
to
be
made
known
to
the
parties
before
the
hearing.?
in
response
to
that,
senator
long
proposed
the
language
which
became
exemption
7
which
he
said
would
meet
that
problem.
now,
in
the
house,
the
relevant
consideration
is
the
focus
on
the
concept
of
no
earlier
or
greater
access.
that
is
essentially
what
senator
long
was
trying
to
get
to
with
the
language
he
proposed
and
the
house
report
does
pick
that
up
which
is
what
i
am
getting
to.
the
concept
is
solid
in
the
66
act,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
discovery
through
the
foia
by
providing
for
earlier
or
greater
access
to
materials
in
an
ongoing
enforcement
proceeding
than
one
could
obtain
by
discovery
with
respect
to
whatever
set
of
discovery
rules
apply
to
that
enforcement
proceeding.
in
sum,
i
suggest
as
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
hardeman
garment
decided
last
year,
?the
legislative
history
of
the
original
version
of
the
exemption
7
clearly
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
include
investigatory
files
of
the
nlrb
within
the
exemption.?
the
question
before
us
i
submit
is
whether
the
1974
amendments
to
exemption
7
were
intended
to
repudiate
the
concept
of
noninterference
with
discovery
in
general
or
with
the
protection
of
board
witness
statements
in
particular.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
between
various
types
of
enforcement
proceedings.
that
is
exactly
right
and
to
that
extent,
we
suggest
that
the
there
cannot
be
a
difference
between
criminal
enforcement
proceedings
and
any
other
type
of
enforcement
proceedings.
the
act
speaks
of
enforcement
proceedings
generically
and
that
it
makes
no
sense
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
say
we
cannot
believe
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
interfere
with
discovery
rules
and
criminal
proceedings,
but
we
believe
it
when
it
comes
to
labor
board
proceedings
which
are
also
enforcement
proceedings,
especially
in
light
of
senator
humphrey?s
particular
concern,
particularly
focused
concern.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
he
was
singling
out
the
labor
board
for
special
treatment.
what
i
think
the
legislative
history
shows
is
that
he
was
particularly
concerned
about
the
board,
and
therefore,
interested
in
getting
the
act
worded
so
that
it
would
protect
against
discovery
in
all
enforcement
proceedings
and
that
is
indeed
what
happened.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
i
am
right
that
the
concept
of
no
earlier
or
greater
access
still
finds
its
way
into
the
74
amendments.
then
a
necessity,
you
must
look
to
this
particular
enforcement
proceeding
to
determine
what
discovery
rules
are
applicable
and
what
access
is
allowed.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
notion
sir
is
of
no
earlier
or
greater
access
than
whatever
the
discovery
rules
in
the
particular
type
of
proceeding
prescribed.
congress
did
not
intend
to
say
that
all
enforcement
proceedings
must
have
the
set
of
discovery
rules.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
congress
was
focusing
particularly
on
a
set
of
cases
which
congress
felt
constituted
a
judicial
distortion
of
the
original
intent.
congress
was
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate
in
1974.
it
identified
in
particular
four
cases
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
none
of
which
had
anything
to
do
with
litigation
that
was
then
ongoing
and
indeed
in
some
of
them
it
was
pretty
far
fetched
that
litigation
could
ever
be
ongoing
and
in
one
of
them,
the
one
dealing
with
the
papers
on
the
death
of
president
kennedy,
the
court
said
there
was
no
possibility
there
could
be
any
further
litigation.
congress
was
particularly
upset
about
those
decisions,
but
congress
mentioned
no
decision
with
which
it
was
upset
that
dealt
with
an
ongoing
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that
is
right
sir
and
i
think
it
is
also
significant
to
note
that
in
the
catalogue
of
judicial
distortions
that
congress
identified,
it
did
not
include
any
of
the
substantial
number
of
appellate
court
decisions,
not
only
district
court,
but
appellate
court
decisions
which
had
protected
board
witness
statements
prior
to
hearing
under
the
1966
act.
there
have
been
quite
a
number
of
such
decisions
because
the
matter
has
been
litigated
heavily
and
there
was
not
a
single
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
any
of
those
decisions
as
being
a
judicial
distortion.
we
suggest
that
that
matches
perfectly
with
senator
hart?s
comments
when
he
specifically
disclaimed
any
intention
to
radically
depart
from
the
intention
of
the
1966
act
and
then
referred
to
the
original
intent
as
not
to
allow
any
earlier
or
greater
access.
the
focus
of
the
74
amendment
was
exactly
what
has
been
suggested.
it
was
this
refusal
to
provide
access
without
regard
to
the
enforcement
proceeding
or
the
relationship
with
the
information
to
the
enforcement
proceeding
or
the
enforcement
proceeding
interest
in
keeping
that
information
from
being
disclosed.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
it
is
a
complete
answer.
congress
has
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
shall
be
no
earlier
or
greater
access,
that
congress
has
determined
that
that
is
an
inherent
harm,
that
it
is
not
going
to
impose
through
the
foia
and
that
it
is
not
permissible,
consistent
with
the
statute
and
the
congressional
intent
for
the
court
to
come
behind
and
say,
well,
we
do
not
think
that
five
days
earlier
are
greater
access.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
exactly,
whatever
the
discovery
rules
in
the
particular
proceeding
provides,
the
foia
matches
that,
but
particular
courts
cannot
come
along
and
say
one
court
thinks
five
days
is
sufficient
and
another
court
thinks
10,
another
court
perhaps
13.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
as
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
the
basic
purpose
of
foia
is
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
access
to
what
agencies
are
doing
and
not
to
benefit
private
litigants.
now,
that
rule
allows
the
public
in
general
the
same
access
to
information
in
ongoing
litigation
as
the
litigants
have.
in
other
words,
if
the
information
is
to
be
provided
to
the
litigants
under
normal
routine
discovery
rules
then
it
must
at
the
same
time
be
provided
to
the
public.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir,
that
is
exactly
what
we
suggest.
the
congress
--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall
that
congress
did
say
that
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear
in
terms
of
the
1966
act.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
congress
said
that
it
was
not
intending
to
provide
earlier
or
greater
access
than
would
be
applicable.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
they
said
it
does
not
apply
to
enforcement
proceedings
in
general
to
the
extent
of
providing
earlier
or
greater
access.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
no
sir,
indeed
all
the
legislative
history
is
to
the
contrary.
the
very
concept
of
no
earlier
or
greater
access
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
we
suggest
that
you
have
got
to
look
at,
again,
the
74
act
was
not
written
on
a
clean
slate
and
you
cannot
look
at
those
words
by
looking
them
up
in
the
dictionary.
that
you
have
got
to
look
at
the
original
act
and
trace
the
history
of
this
legislation,
look
at
the
evils
that
congress
was
trying
to
cure
and
look
at
what
senator
hart
said
he
was
not
proposing
to
do
and
one
of
the
things
he
was
not
proposing
to
do
was
to
interfere
with
the
concept
of
no
earlier
or
greater
access
so
that
sets
the
framework
for
what
those
words
mean.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
suggests
and
just
to
get
back
to
the
point
that
was
raised,
the
fifth
circuit
suggests
that
there
is
no
presumptive
damage
done
to
the
balance
struck
by
the
board
between
discovery
and
protection
by
an
order
that
the
statements
be
disclosed
five
days
in
advance
because
the
statements
will
become
public
at
the
hearing
in
any
event
and
because
little
intimidation
is
likely
to
occur
in
such
a
short
period.
now,
we
contend
that
the
earlier
or
greater
access
concept
is
sufficient
to
answer
that
question,
but
it
also
ought
to
be
pointed
out
that
the
harm
from
any
premature
release
of
the
identity
of
expected
testimony
of
witnesses
in
enforcement
proceeding
is
precisely
the
danger
that
they
can
be
persuaded
to
alter
their
testimony
and
that
there
is
no
answer
to
suggest
as
the
fifth
circuit
did
that
the
intimidator
may
be
prosecuted
after
the
fact
before
the
testimony
is
altered,
there
is
no
amount
of
after
the
fact
prosecution
that
is
going
to
get
that
case
back.
that
testimony
has
altered
that
case
may
be
lost.
moreover,
as
the
sixth
circuit
noted
in
hardeman
garment,
intimidation
may
be
subtle
and
not
susceptible
or
prudent.
we
submit
that
these
dangers
rejected
by
the
fifth
circuit
are
indeed
precisely
the
harms
that
congress
aimed
at
when
it
developed
the
concept
of
no
earlier
or
greater
public
access
under
the
foia.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
your
honor,
the
board
has
accepted
this
court?s
decision
in
the
jencks
case
as
applicable
to
the
board.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
and
due
process
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
foia
law.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
second
circuit
shortly
after
the
jencks
case
was
issued,
the
second
circuit
did
rule
that
the
jencks
case
apply
to
board
proceedings
that
they
were
sufficiently
like
criminal
proceedings
that
are
ought
to
apply
and
the
board
did
accept
that
concept.
in
response
to
that
second
circuit
decision
did
enact
its
own
jencks
rule.
it
is
not
employable.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
board
would
certainly
be
free
to
try.
the
case
law
suggests
that
the
board
would
be
told
to
go
back,
but
in
any
event,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
due
process
question.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
it
was
based
on
the
concept
of
inherent
unfairness
in
not
allowing
the
--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
there
is
an
inherent
unfairness.
i
stand
corrected
if
i
have
spoken
to
loosely,
whatever
the,
without
discussing
precisely
what
the
particular
framework
of
jencks
is.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir,
the
answer
is
yes.
that
the
foia
simply
says
no
earlier
or
greater
access
than
your
own
discovery
rules
provide
and
the
foia
does
not
purport
to
tell
you
what
your
discovery
rules
are
in
a
board
case
or
in
a
criminal
case
or
in
any
other
enforcement
proceeding.
it
may
be
measured
by
constitutional
due
process
supervisory
standards
what
elementary
fairness
requires,
but
not
by
foia.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that
is
correct
sir.
just
as
if
this
court
itself
changed
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
then
the
foia
would
have
to
respect
that.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
legislative
history
in
the
house
of
the
1966,
the
house
report
specifically
uses
those
words,
no
earlier
or
greater
access
and
senator
hart
picks
them
up
and
he
describes
that
as
having
been
the
purpose
of
the
1966
act
in
the
language
of
exemption
7
and
he
says
we
do
not
intend
to
change
that.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
well,
we
suggest
sir
that
the
statute
does
not
say
on
its
face
any
different
than
congress
clearly
intended.
in
any
event,
in
this
case,
the
board
certainly
is
not
intending
to
frustrate
the
act.
the
board
is
simply
saying
that
the
act
ought
not
to
provide
early
or
greater
access
so
that
it
is
not
intended
as
a
discovery
tool
and
it
is
impossible
in
the
context
of
ongoing
litigation
to
frustrate
the
foia
by
changing
your
discovery
rules.
if
this
court
should
change
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
tighten
up
in
some
respect
because
it
felt
that
the
present
rules
are
unworkable,
that
would
not
in
any
sense
be
frustrating
the
foia.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
if
you
start
on
page
27,
mr.
justice
stevens,
he
says
my
reading
of
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
intended
that
this
seventh
exemption
was
to
prevent
harm
to
the
government?s
case
in
court
by
not
allowing
an
opposing
litigant
earlier
or
greater
access
than
he
would
otherwise
have.
he
then
goes
on
to
say
what
the
evils
are
and
then
he
says,
that
we
suggest
is
not
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
passed
this
basic
act
in
1966.
then
as
now,
we
recognize
the
need
for
law
enforcement
agencies
to
be
able
to
keep
their
records
and
files
confidential.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
your
honor,
he
is
saying
that
it
is
the
intention
of
congress
in
1974
to
return
to
the
original
intention
when
the
act
was
passed
in
1966
and
when
he
says,
then
as
now,
we
recognize
the
need,
he
is
saying
that
the
congress
is
recognizing
the
same
need
now
as
it
recognized
in
1966,
the
whole
thrust
is
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
1966
act.
the
problem
was
with
the
way
the
courts
had
interpreted
it.
so
now
congress
had
to
go
back
and
figure
out
some
language
that
the
courts
could
not
ignore.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
exactly,
sir
and
that
is
why
i
suggested
that
it
was
significant
that
congress
did
not
point
to
any
case
which
denied
earlier
or
greater
access
in
an
ongoing
enforcement
proceeding.
congress
focused
on
four
cases
specifically.
it
focused
on
an
identified
evil
and
when
you
match
that
up
with
senator
hart
saying,
we
do
not
intend
any
radical
departure
from
existing
case
law
and
none
of
the
cases
they
referred
to
and
they
were
well
aware
of
the
cases,
that
is
what
prompted
this
amendment,
they
had
looked
through
the
cases
that
they
did
not
like.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
what
he
is
referring
to
there
is
the
other
part
of
exemption
7.
there
are
really
two
parts
to
exemption
7.
there
is
a
per
se
protection
where
it
would
result
in
earlier
or
greater
access.
if
you
look
at
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
29
and
the
top
of
page
30,
senator
hart
explained
that
the
amendment
would
continue
to
bar
disclosure,
first
where
the
production
of
a
record
would
interfere
with
enforcement
procedures.
this
would
apply
wherever
the
government?s
case
in
court
are
contrary
to
prospective
law
enforcement
proceeding
would
be
harmed
by
the
premature
release
of
evidence
and
information.
now,
i
had
suggested
to
the
court,
that
has
to
be
matched
up
with
the
original
congressional
intent
and
you
have
to
look
at
what
they
intended
there.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir,
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
?this
would
also
apply
where
the
agency
could
show,?
and
this
is
where
the
specific
showing
comes
in
perhaps,
?that
the
disclosure
of
the
information
would
substantially
harm
such
proceedings
by
impeding
any
necessary
investigation.?
that
has
got
to
mean
something
other
than
no
earlier
or
greater
access
because
he
says
it
would
also
apply
and
we
suggest
that
if
there
is
a
case
by
case
determination
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
an
ongoing
enforcement
proceeding
that
that
is
what
he
intended
to
apply
to,
but
in
any
event
we
do
not
have
that
case
here.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir,
but
congress
is
already
applying
--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir.
we
also
rely
on
the
proposition
that
it
hardly
needs
argument
that
intimidation
is
a
danger
from
the
premature
release
of
information
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes
sir
exactly.
i
would
like
to
turn
just
very
briefly
to
exemption
5.
in
the
alternative,
we
asked
the
court
to
rule
that
investigatory
witness
statements
are
protected
by
exemption
5
of
the
foia
as
work
product
except
of
course
for
the
use
of
jencks
statements.
this
court
has
already
held
in
sears
that
exemption
5
includes
the
work
product
privilege
was
well
as
the
executive
privilege.
while
the
executive
privilege
protects
only
deliberative
material
and
that
is
of
course
what
this
court
ruled
in
the
mink
case,
the
work
product
privilege
protects
trial
preparation
material
which
these
statements
clearly
are
under
hickman
v.
taylor.
in
sears,
the
court
referred
to
the
work
product
rule
of
hickman
as
applicable
to
government
attorneys
in
litigation,
and
therefore,
within
the
scope
of
exemption
5,
we
suggest
that
since
the
statements
in
question
are
protected
by
hickman
that
it
follows
that
they
are
protected
by
exemption
5.
now,
i
might
just
finally
point
out
that
this
court
itself,
really
going
to
both
points
for
a
minute,
this
court
itself
has
emphasized
that
the
purpose
of
the
foia
is
not
to
serve
the
needs
of
a
particular
litigant
and
they
are,
therefore,
necessarily
not
to
provide
discovery,
but
to
satisfy
the
public
interest
and
the
public
interest
of
what
the
board?s
investigation
shows
in
this
proceeding
is
going
to
come
out
in
the
trial.
the
record
will
be
fully
disclosed.
as
this
court
said
in
sears,
when
it
denied
access
to
the
general
counsel?s
go
memorandum
making
a
decision
to
prosecute,
this
court
said,
the
public
interest
is
not
strong
in
seeing
these
because
they
will
come
out
in
the
trial
in
any
event.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
not
the
situation
we
have
here
that
five
days
from
the
date
that
this
order
was
issued,
this
case
would
have
gone
to
trial,
but
for
the
order
and
that
the
public
interest
in
whatever
the
general
counsel
had
investigated
would
come
forward
at
that
time.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
then
it
would
have
been
six
months,
unless
the
discovery
rules
provided
for
access
earlier.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
no
sir,
it
does
not,
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
discovery
in
many
criminal
proceedings
last
for
quite
awhile
and
that
may
be
six
months
or
two
years
as
well.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
and
that
is
a
practical
point.
the
first
circuit
in
good
friend
v.
western
said
and
i
quote,
?we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
transfer
from
the
board
to
the
courts
the
case-by-case
adjudication
of
discovery
disputes
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.?
such
case-by-case
adjudication
is
precisely
what
the
first
circuit
would
require
whether
the
requirement
of
the
board
shows
specific
harm
in
every
case.
the
recent
experience
of
federal
courts
with
subtle
discovery
suggest
that
those
delays
will
be
crippling
and
they
will
occur
in
every
case.
they
will
be
foia
case
within
every
board
case
and
we
suggest
in
light
of
this
court?s
admonition
in
air
force
v.
rose
that
the
foia
is
intended
to
be
a
practical
workable
statute
and
that
the
exemptions
are
intended
to
be
practical
and
workable.
that
the
first
circuit
is
right
that,
that
is
inherently
impractical
and
unworkable
and
will
impose
crippling
delays
upon
all
enforcement
procedures.
