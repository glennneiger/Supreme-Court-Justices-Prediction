we
really
know
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
we
do
not
have
to
say
in
front
of
god
or
anybody
that
water
is
a
mineral,
do
we?

i
have
also
have
for
announcement
the
opinion
in
number
77-380,
andrus
versus
charlestone
stone
products
company.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
and
the
question
is
whether
water
is
a
locatable
mineral
under
the
mining
law
of
1872.
the
secretory
of
the
interior
challenged
the
validity
of
respondents
mining
claims.
administrative
boards
held
most
of
the
claims
invalid.
the
district
court
reversed
and
among
other
rulings,
granted
respondent
access
to
water
that
it
had
discovered
on
one
of
the
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
adding
sue
sponte
that
claimed
with
water
was
made
valid
by
the
presence
of
the
water.
by
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
a
mining
claim
is
not
made
valid
merely
because
of
the
substance
discovered
on
the
land
is
“a
valuable
mineral”,
within
the
dictionary
definition
of
these
words.
it
is
clear
from
the
mining
statutes
and
that
private
water
rights
on
federal
lands
are
to
be
governed
by
state
and
local
law
and
custom.
administrative
decisions
and
decision
of
this
court
confirms
this
view,
which
is
also
supported
by
consideration
of
the
practical
problems
that
will
arise
from
having
two
overlapping
systems
for
acquisition
of
private
water
rights.
