mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
the
government’s
petition
for
review
of
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
sara

beale
seeking
review
of
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
holding
that
water
is
a
mineral
subject
to
location
under
the
federal
mining
laws.
to
put
it
in
another
way,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
rights
to
water
on
the
public
domain
are
mineral
rights
which
should
be
acquired
pursuant
to
the
federal
mining
laws.
since
1866,
the
federal
mining
laws
have
permitted
citizens
to
discover
and
extract
valuable
mineral
deposits
on
the
public
domain
and
to
secure
fee
title
to
lands
containing
such
discoveries.
a
claimant
must
establish
that
he
has
discovered
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
limits
of
each
claim.
to
show
the
value
of
such
a
discovery,
the
claimant
must
establish
that
a
person
of
ordinary
prudence
would
be
justified
in
the
expenditure
of
both
time
and
money
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
minerals
from
such
a
claim
could
be
marketed
at
a
profit.
at
the
outset,
none
of
the
parties
in
this
case
viewed
it
as
a
water
law
case.
the
disputed
issue
was,
rather,
whether
the
respondent
could
show
a
valuable
and
marketable
discovery
of
sand
and
gravel.
in
1942,
respondent’s
predecessor
in
interest
had
located
more
than
20
plaster
mining
claims
in
a
narrow
wash
on
public
lands
about
15
miles
northwest
of
las
vegas,
nevada.
in
the
aggregate
these
claims,
and
several
others
located
a
few
years
later,
cover
about
500
acres
of
land
and
they
encompass
a
massive
deposit
of
an
estimated
20
million
cubic-yards
of
sand
and
gravel.
until
1955
sand
and
gravel
were
subject
to
the
federal
mining
laws.
but,
in
that
year,
congress
withdrew
common
variety
minerals
including
sand
and
gravel
from
location
under
the
mining
laws.
the
secretary
of
interior
initiated
administrative
proceedings
in
1965
contending
that
each
of
respondent’s
25
sand
and
gravel
claims
were
invalid
for
want
of
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
prior
to
this
1955
withdrawal
date.
a
hearing
was
conducted
at
which
the
secretary
presented
the
testimony
of
a
mining
engineer
who
stated
that
the
excessive
distance
from
these
claims
to
the
market
in
las
vegas
and
the
lack
of
water
to
wash
the
material
prevented
profitable
marketing
of
this
sand
and
gravel
prior
to
the
withdrawal
date
in
1955.
it
is
undisputed
that
water
was
first
discovered
on
these
claims
in
1962,
when
respondent
drilled
a
successful
well
on
claim
22.
the
presence
or
absence
of
water
was
important
here
because
washing
sand
and
gravel
greatly
increases
its
marketability.
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
credited
the
testimony
of
the
government’s
expert
witness
and
concluded
that
respondent
had
established
a
valuable
discovery
of
sand
and
gravel
on
only
one
of
the
25
claims,
the
one
from
which
sizable
deposits
had
actually
been
removed
prior
to
1955.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
in
most
cases,
i
believe
it
does.
the
difference
between
a
load
and
a
plaster
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
a
load
claim
is
one
where
there
is
a
vein
of
the
mineral
running
through
so
that
often
one
can
come
with
a
pick
or
whatever
to
get
at
that
mineral,
whereas,
the
plaster
claims
usually
involve
a
mineral
more
broadly
dispersed
throughout
the
geographic
limits
of
the
claim.
so
very
often
in
the
case
of,
say,
a
gold-plaster
claim,
one
would
use
water
to
wash
out
the
other
materials
and
get
at
the
valuable
mineral.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
do
not
believe
so.
in
the
case
of
sand
and
gravel
plaster
claim,
it
is
used
to
only
wash
the
water.
but
in
this
case
the
respondent
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right.
respondent
sought
review
of
this
decision
in
the
district
court
which
satisfied
the
administrative
decision
as
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
the
court
held
that
the
interior
board
had
erred
in
crediting
the
testimony
of
the
government’s
expert
witness,
found
credible
the
respondent’s
evidence
on
the
issue
of
marketability
and
it
concluded
that
at
least
the
claims
numbered
1
through
16
had
been
proved
valid.
moreover,
it
concluded
that
the
respondent
should
be
permitted
access
to
claim
22
in
order
to
make
use
of
the
water
produced
by
the
well.
the
district
court
did
not
offer
any
legal
basis
for
offering
access
to
the
water
on
claim
22.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
with
one
significant
addition.
it
held
that
claim
22,
itself,
was
also
valid
because
the
water
that
respondent
had
discovered
on
that
claim
was
itself
a
locatable
mineral
under
the
mining
laws.
the
parties
had
neither
briefed
nor
argued
this
issue.
the
court,
however,
looked
to
the
mining
laws
and
found
that
there
was
no
provision
that
expressly
defined
water
as
a
non-mineral.
the
court
stressed
the
fact
that
the
recovery
procedures
used
in
the
case
of
many
hard
minerals
required
the
use
of
water.
therefore,
it
found
that
it
should
not
assume
that
congress
had
been
unaware
of
what
the
court
called
the
necessary
glove
of
water
for
the
hand
of
mining,
and
it
had
made
no
provision
for
the
necessary
acquisition
of
water
rights
for
the
operation
of
such
claims.
accordingly,
it
concluded
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
water
itself,
should
be
locatable
as
a
mineral.
in
the
case
of
claim
22,
the
court
held
that
the
evidence
established
the
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral,
first,
because
water
has
an
intrinsic
value
in
a
dessert
area.
moreover,
because
respondent’s
use
of
the
water
to
wash
the
sand
and
gravel
thereby
increasing
the
value
of
the
sand
and
gravel,
show
that
there
was
a
profitable
market
for
the
water
and
that
it
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
the
government
submits
that
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
water
is
a
locatable
mineral
disregards
the
intent
of
congress.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
in
our
petition,
we
note
that
there
are
other
respects
in
which
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
had
erred,
but
we
did
not
raise
those
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
decision
disregards
the
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
mining
laws
themselves
that
the
acquisition
of
private
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
should
be
governed
by
state
and
local
laws
and,
therefore,
not
by
the
federal
mining
laws.
the
court’s
decision,
in
our
view,
also
disregards
the
precedence
of
both
this
court
and
of
the
longstanding
administrative
interpretation
of
the
department
of
interior.
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
is
that
congress
did
not
expressly
define
water
as
a
non-mineral
and
that
it
made
no
expressed
provision
for
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
necessary
to
work
mineral
claims.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
the
1955
legislation
to
which
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
is
the
one
which
withdrew
the
common
variety
minerals.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
right.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it
specifies
the
minerals
sand,
gravel,
pumice
i
believe,
fossilized
bones.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it
specifies
the
minerals
and
i
believe
in
both
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
1955
legislation
indicating
that
there
was
no
intent
to
interfere
with
state
water
law.
we
think
that
that
buttresses
not
only
our
conclusion
that
the
mining
laws
do
not
affect
water
laws,
but
should
water
be
held
to
be
a
locatable
mineral,
would
make
it
impossible
to
somehow
construe,
in
my
view,
the
provision
of
removal
of
common
varieties
as
applicable
to
water.
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
that
since
there
was
no
expressed
provision
for
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
that
are
necessary
to
work
many
mineral
claims.
the
court
thought
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
provide
some
mechanism
so
that
miners
could
acquire
these
rights.
therefore,
it
must
have
intended
the
only
provision
which
the
court
sought
hand,
the
mineral
laws
themselves,
to
apply
to
the
acquisition
of
water
rights.
the
premise
for
this
reasoning
is
false.
the
general
mining
law,
since
their
inception
in
1866,
have
provided
separately
for
the
right
to
mine
valuable
minerals
on
the
one
hand,
and
for
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
on
the
other
hand.
congress
did
recognize
from
the
outset
the
critical
role
that
water
played
in
mining
operations.
but,
instead
of
establishing
a
federal
statutory
system
to
govern
the
acquisition
of
private
water
rights
on
public
lands
as
it
set
up
a
system
for
the
right
to
acquire
minerals.
instead,
congress
chose
to
ratify
the
rights
that
were
recognized
under
the
state
and
the
local
laws
that
were
developing
in
the
erred
regions
to
allocate
water
among
the
competing
uses
including
mining.
both
the
general
mining
laws
enacted
in
1866
and
in
1870
contained
separate
provisions
regarding
water
rights.
these
provisions
were
left
unchanged
when
congress
enacted
the
1872
mining
law,
and
they
are
now
codified
as
sections
51
and
52
of
title
30.
they
are
reprinted
in
page
two
of
the
government’s
brief.
section
51,
which
was
part
of
the
mining
law
of
1866,
provides
that
rights
acquired
by
priority
of
possession
to
the
use
of
water
on
public
lands,
rights
that
are
recognized
and
acknowledged
by
local
customs,
laws,
and
decisions
of
the
courts
should
be
maintained
and
protected.
then,
in
1870,
congress
enacted
what
is
now
section
52
which
provides
additionally
that
any
patents
granted
or
homesteads
allowed
are
subject
to
vested
and
accrued
water
rights
acquired
or
recognized
under
section
51.
congress
thus
expressly
provided
in
the
mining
laws
themselves
that
the
acquisition
of
private
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
is
governed
by
state
and
local
law,
not
by
the
federal
mining
laws.
other
public
land
laws,
particularly
the
dessert
land
act
of
1877,
advents
the
same
intent
to
sanction
water
rights
acquired
in
accord
with
state
law
rather
than
to
establish
a
new
and
separate
system
of
federal
law.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
precisely
the
very
next
thing
i
was
going
to
say.
this
court
has
recognized
that
intent.
in
particular,
in
california
oregon
power
company
versus
beaver
portland
cement,
the
court
said
as
follows
about
these
two
provisions.
the
court
said
that
“provisions
of
the
1866
and
1870
mining
laws"
approve
and
confirm
the
policy
of
appropriation
for
beneficial
use
as
recognized
by
local
rules
and
customs
under
legislation
and
the
judicial
decisions
of
the
erred
land
states
as
the
test
and
the
measure
of
public
rights
in
and
to
the
non-navigable
waters
on
the
public
domain.
the
inclusion
in
the
mining
laws
of
these
specific
provisions
for
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
precludes
any
inference
that
congress
intended
the
federal
law
of
mining
claims
to
govern
the
acquisition
of
water
rights.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
was
apparently
unaware
of
these
provisions
and
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
them.
contrary
then
to
the
court
of
appeals’
belief
that
it
would
be
advancing
the
purposes
of
the
mining
laws.
instead,
its
interpretation
of
the
mining
laws
would
defeat
what
this
court
has
recognized
as
congress’
clear
intent
that
the
acquisition
of
such
rights
should
be
governed
by
the
state
and
local
laws.
congress
was
well-aware
that
the
western
states
were
gradually
developing
a
system
of
water
laws
that
was
especially
suited
for
the
needs
of
that
erred
region.
congress
obviously
intended
that
private
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
would
be
acquired
in
accordance
with
this
specially
suitable
system.
we
believe,
therefore,
that
a
reading
of
the
mining
laws
as
a
whole
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
congress’
intent
to
treat
water
rights
a
separate
and
distinct
from
the
right
to
mine
valuable
minerals.
but
even
if
these
provisions
were
unclear,
any
possible
doubt
on
the
score
has
long
since
been
removed
by
the
administrative
decisions
of
the
department
of
the
interior
which
is
charged
with
regulating
the
acquisition
of
rights
in
the
public
lands.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
think
that
the
position
here
is
completely
consistent.
the
question
of
whether
federal
water
rights
--
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no,
i
do
not
think
that.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
do
not
mean
to
draw
that
distinction.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that,
in
the
mining
laws
and
in
the
dessert
land
act,
congress
was
speaking
to
the
acquisition
of
private
rights,
the
rights
of
homesteaders,
the
rights
of
individuals.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
california
oregon
power
co.
case,
the
united
states
initially
had
in
the
public
land
states,
the
ownership
rights
of
not
only
the
land
but
the
waters.
in
the
california
oregon
power
co.
case,
this
court
said
that
it
viewed
the
intent
of
congress
as
intending
to
give
out
land
patents
on
the
one
hand
under
one
system,
under
the
mining
laws,
under
the
agricultural
entry
laws,
under
the
dessert
land
act,
and
also
to
provide
a
way
whereby
private
rights
to
waters
on
the
public
domain
could
be
acquired.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
different
question
from
what
happens
when
the
federal
government
needs
to
use
certain
water
rights.
if
they
had
not
been
given
out
to
private
individuals,
then
the
questions
are
entirely
different,
i
would
think.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
believe
that
is
correct,
yes.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
it
certainly
is
and
i
think
the
reservation
doctrine
is
based
upon
the
notion
that
congress
had
those
water
rights
at
the
time
that
it
set
aside
land
for
a
certain
purpose.
congress
had
those
water
rights.
no
private
party
is
in
the
same
position.
it
is
a
question
of
interpreting
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
mining
laws
as
to
how
private
rights
would
be
acquired,
which
is
really
quite
separate
from
the
reservation.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
if
congress
had
not
expressly
provided
in
the
mining
laws
that
water
rights
acquired
under
state
and
local
law
should
be
acquired
under
state
and
local
law
and
would
be
recognized
by
the
federal
government
and
if
congress
had
not
in
other
statute,
such
as
the
dessert
land
act,
indicated
that
there
was
this
division,
that
might
have
been
a
possible
interpretation.
if
this
court
were
to
view
the
provisions
as
ambiguous
however,
the
decisions
of
the
department
of
interior
beginning
in
the
1880s,
shortly
after
the
adaption
of
the
mining
law
of
1872,
resolved
any
doubt
that
department
held
unambiguously
that
water
claims
could
not
be
patented
under
the
mining
law
but
must
be
acquired
instead
under
state
law.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
might
find
the
statutes
unambiguous,
that
doubt
has
long
since
been
resolved
by
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
department
charged
with
administering
the
public
land
laws.
that
view
of
the
statutes
was
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
1976,
in
a
comprehensive
decision
which
we
have
reprinted
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
we
believe
that,
given
the
fact
that
this
longstanding
interpretation
has
prevailed
for
a
century
and
has
been
the
basis
for
a
set
old
system
of
property
rights,
it
should
be
virtually
conclusive
at
this
point.
the
recent
decision
on
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
on
this
point,
to
which
i
refer,
convincingly
demonstrates
the
soundness
of
that
department’s
view.
they
relied
not
only
upon
the
theory
of
this
court
in
the
california
oregon
power
co.
case,
which
looked
to
the
structure
of
the
mining
laws
themselves
and
the
fact
that
congress
had
provided
on
the
one
hand
for
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
and
on
the
other
hand,
for
the
acquisition
for
the
right
to
mine
valuable
minerals.
but,
the
board
also
took
a
very
common
sense
view
of
congress’
intent
in
using
the
term
“mineral.
it
recognized
that
if
congress
had
intended
the
mining
laws
and
the
use
of
the
term
“mineral”
to
be
given
the
broadest
possible
definition
of
the
term
such
that
when
one
speaks
of
the
division
of
all
matter
into
animal,
vegetable,
and
mineral
and
intended
that
all
matter
that
could
be
classified
as
mineral
in
that
sense
to
be
locatable
under
the
mining
laws,
then
all
the
public
lands
will
be
mineral
lands.
if
this
were
so,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
separate
provisions
in
the
many
public
land
laws
dealing
with
non-mineral
lands
permitting
agricultural
entry
and
so
forth.
congress
clearly,
as
the
interior
board
recognized,
could
not
have
intended
the
term
“mineral”
to
be
given
such
a
broad
definition
which
would
make
nonsense
of
the
mining
laws
and
of
so
many
of
the
other
public
land
laws.
the
board
also
noted,
and
this
is
an
important
consideration,
that
the
location
of
water
as
a
mineral
would
invite
the
widespread
abuse
of
the
mining
laws
by
persons
who
were
seeking
public
lands
for
other
purposes
who
would
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
a
widespread
occurrence
of
water
and
the
relative
ease
with
which
mining
claims
may
be
patented.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
precisely
correct.
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
indicates
clearly
that
the
location
of
sand
and
gravel
claims
were
being
misused
and
that
it
was
being
used
to
acquire
land
for
residential
purposes
and
all
sorts
of
purposes
not
comprehended
in
the
mining
laws.
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
concluded
that
the
very
same
abuses
would
be
invited
if
water,
itself,
which
is
of
such
common
occurrence,
could
be
located
under
the
mining
laws.
it
is
relatively
easy
to
acquire
a
mining
claim.
it
would
invite
abuse
for
that
reason.
we
have
no
figures
available
that
would
tell
precisely
how
many
acres
of
public
lands
might
contain
water
which
could
be
discovered,
but
it
seems
relatively
clear
that
millions
of
acres
of
public
land
would
be
affected.
we
believe
that
setting
aside
the
long-established
administrative
and
judicial
construction
of
the
mining
laws
would
throw
established
rights
into
question
and
would,
therefore,
completely
unsettle
the
law
of
water
rights
throughout
the
western
states.
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
because
it
does
not
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
water
rights
provisions
adapted
as
part
of
the
mining
laws,
does
not
give
a
hint
whether
that
court’s
opinion
should
be
viewed
as
holding
that
the
location
of
mineral
claims
to
water
rights
is
the
exclusive
method
by
which
private
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
could
be
obtained.
perhaps
it
might
have
intended
that
there
was
to
be
an
alternative
method
to
state
law.
but,
if
that
decision
were
interpreted
as
holding
that
the
only
way
that
one
could
acquire
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
is
under
the
mineral
mining
laws,
then
private
rights
long
since
considered
throughout
the
west
would
presumably
be
invalidated.
the
respondent
seeks
to
avoid
this
obviously
undesirable
result
and
to
interpret
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
somewhat
more
narrowly
arguing
that
the
mining
law
should
be
viewed
as
merely
an
alternative
to
state
procedures.
however,
respondent
offers
no
evidence
that
congress
actually
intended
to
create
such
an
imaginable
dual
system.
harmonizing
the
rights
acquired
under
the
two
systems
would
be
a
difficult
task
and
one
would
surely
generate
extensive
litigation.
moreover,
the
mining
laws
were
never
designed
to
allocate
water
rights
and
we
believe
they
are
ill-suited
to
this
task.
respondent
has
failed
to
suggest
any
reason
why
this
court
should
reverse
all
prior
judicial
and
administrative
interpretations
of
the
mining
laws
to
reach
such
a
result.
we
believe
that
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
mining
claims,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
an
examination
of
the
structure
of
the
mining
laws
themselves,
each
compels
a
conclusion
that
congress
did
not,
in
fact,
intend
water
rights
on
the
public
domain
to
be
located
under
the
federal
mining
laws.
but,
rather,
that
it
intended
that
such
rights
would
be
acquired
pursuant
to
state
and
local
law.
we,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
in
so
far
that
it
holds
that
the
water
on
claim
22
was
subject
to
location
under
the
mining
laws.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
just
one
or
two
very
brief
points,
first,
on
the
court’s
question
as
to
generally
what
is
a
mineral.
the
government
would
contend
that
there
is
no
one
single
definition
of
the
term
“mineral”
for
all
purposes.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that,
originally,
the
mining
laws
or
at
least
at
some
point
in
their
history
were
construed
to
apply
to
oil
and
gas
which
later
then
dealt
with
more
specifically
in
the
mineral
leasing
laws.
that
is
my
understanding.
i
do
not
think
that
one
can
assume.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
my
understanding.
oil
and
gas
were
construed.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
was
just
about
to
add.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
correct.
we
think
that
that
kind
of
a
very
broad
definition,
as
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals
said,
just
makes
no
sense
in
this
context.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
yes,
i
would
think
that.
we
would
have
to
agree
that
within
the
broadest
definition
of
the
term
“mineral”
as
an
animal,
vegetable,
and
mineral,
water
is
included
and
dirt
is
included.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
suggestion
or
any
evidence
but
that
is
what
congress
was
thinking
of
when
it
allowed
the
exploration
discovery
of
valuable
minerals.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
i
do
not
think
that
is
quite
the
way
i
would
phrase
that.
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
mining
statutes
themselves,
we
see
water
treated
separately.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
and
with
no
provisions
in
the
1866
and
1870
mining
laws
themselves,
then
i
would
think
we
would
rely
upon
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals’
construction.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
very
wavy
as
to
how
the
acts
have
been
construed.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
is
exactly
correct.
from
the
1880s
on
and
a
whole
series
of
decision
which
we
find
very
persuasive.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
goes
to
springs
case
that
that
is
not
a
mineral.
the
only
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
draw
to
the
court’s
attention
is
that
respondents
have
tried
to
emphasize
the
narrowness
of
this
decision
and
the
fact
that
if
the
mineral
laws
were
construed
as
an
alternative
way
of
acquiring
water
rights,
that
really
would
not
unsettle
the
law.
the
western
water
law
would
not
throw
established
rights
to
question
and
so
forth.
but,
the
very
point
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
relied
is
the
fact
that
a
mining
claim
need
not
specify
what
mineral
it
is
located
for
as
the
claims
here
did
not
indicate
sand
and
gravel
or
water,
unless
someone
later,
these
claims
were
located
in
1942.
now,
at
this
late
date,
it
is
possible
for
respondents
to
claim
that
they
were
located
for
water.
there
are
many
claims
outstanding
that
were
located
in
1940
and
1950
or
whenever.
it
would
be
possible
now
to
attempt
to
validate
those
on
the
theory
that
water
was
present.
one
can
imagine,
of
course,
the
difficulties
that
trying
to
harmonize
those
rights
with
the
rights
acquired
under
state
law
would
cause.
the
final
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
theory
at
least
was
that
the
value
of
the
mineral
deposit
here
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
water
has
an
intrinsic
value
in
the
dessert
region.
it
seems
to
me
if
that
construction
were
adapted,
it
would
substantially
lessen
the
impact
on
the
prudent
man
and
marketability
test,
and
so
forth.
if
you
could
find
water,
you
could
argue
under
this
decision
that
your
claim,
just
simply
by
showing
water
was
present
in
an
arid
area
which,
would
shell
a
valuable
discovery.
ms.
sara
sun
beale
that
water?
ms.
sara
sun
beale
no.
our
contention
is
that
water
is
not
a
locatable
mineral
under
the
mining
laws.
if
there
are
no
other
questions?
