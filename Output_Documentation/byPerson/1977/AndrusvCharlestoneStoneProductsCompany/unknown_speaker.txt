mrs.
beale,
would
you
help
me
out
of
my
ignorance.
a
plaster
mine
is
a
mine
which
involves
the
use
of
water,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
a
plaster
mine
does
not
inevitably
involve
the
use
of
water?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
question
you
brought
here,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
1955
legislation
has
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
common
variety
minerals.
unknown
speaker
it
specifies
all.
i
could
not
find
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
could
not
find
the
language
of
the
legislation
in
the
papers
here,
but
it
specifies
every
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
beale,
do
you
think
your
position
here
is
fully
consistent
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
taken
before,
say,
in
the
original
number
8
where
it
involves
a
reclamation
service
dam
in
california?
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states,
to
get
its
water
rights,
must
comply
with
state
law.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
congressional
acts
up
to
date
should
not
be
understood
to
bind
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
why
was
it
not
speaking
to
how
the
united
states
should
get
its
rights?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
however
this
case
is
decided,
it
has
no
relevant
impact
upon
that
other
litigation.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
not
arguable
though
that
by
granting
mining
claims
that
the
united
states
impliedly
grants
water
right
or
reserves
them
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
did
the
ninth
circuit
arrive
at
this
conclusion?
did
it
take
the
position
you
presented
to
it?
unknown
speaker
your
client
came
by
this
by
accident.
unknown
speaker
and
despite
the
dessert
land
act?
unknown
speaker
you
could
be
quite
right
in
your
argument,
i
suppose,
about
the
relationship
between
the
mining
laws
and
the
dessert
land
act
and
still
lose
just
because
water
is
not
a
mineral.
unknown
speaker
how
about
that
question?
the
department
of
interior’s
position
is
consistently
that
water
is
not
a
mineral.
it
is
not
because
water
rights
are
subject
to
local
law
or
anything.
it
is
because
water
is
not
a
mineral.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
not
no,
but
yes,
gas
and
oil
probably
are
minerals
but
not
dealt
with
out
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
just
bought
some
soil
the
other
day.
it
was
pretty
expensive.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
question
is
what
congress
intended
by
the
word
“mineral.
at
least
that
is
one
question.
it
might
have
not
intended
to
include
water
even
if
water
is
a
mineral.
unknown
speaker
how
do
most
dictionaries
define
mineral?
do
they
include
water?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had,
you
would
be
citing
them,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
good
liquid
mineral.
unknown
speaker
if
one
perceives
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
childhood
game
that
everything
is
animal,
mineral,
or
vegetables,
certainly,
water
is
a
mineral.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
must
go
to
some
other
statutory
plan
to
get
water
out
from
under
the
word
“mineral.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
was
no
dessert
land
act?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
would
say
water
was
not
intended
to
be
a
mineral.
unknown
speaker
what
do
they
say
about
mineral
water?
