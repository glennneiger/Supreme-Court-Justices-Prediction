that
was
our
holding
in
beaver
portland
cement,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
a
private
claimant,
for
example,
would
have
no
claim
for
water
under
the
implied
reservation
doctrine,
although
that
was
not
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
the
original
number
8
but,
that
is
certainly
an
example
of
a
way
a
governmental
right
might
be
different
from
a
private
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
one
reason
why
congress
acted
the
way
it
did
in
1955,
to
eliminate
sand
and
gravel
pans
as
if
people
were
really
getting
the
pans
not
for
the
valuable
sand
and
gravel,
but
because
they
wanted
the
acreage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
this
court
not
make
quite
a
bit
of
them
in
the
beaver
portland
cement
case,
written
by
justice
sutherland
who
is,
himself,
regarded
as
an
expert
on
western
water
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
is
unfair
to
say
that
most
western
lawyers
involved
in
water
law
have
read
that
decision
to
mean
that
those
two
acts
savored
the
water
from
the
land
and
left
the
water
to
acquisition
by
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
now
say
that
perhaps
those
lawyers
were
wrong
in
reading
the
decision
that
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
if
the
dessert
land
act
savored
the
water
from
the
land,
did
that
not
mean
that
no
further
water
could
be
acquired
in
the
same
way
that
you
acquire
other
mineral
patents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
is
from
your
home
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
troubled
at
all
by
the
ninth
circuit’s
failure
to
refer
at
all
to
the
beaver
portland
cement
case
in
its
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
two
tests
are
quite
different
though,
are
they
not?
if
you
are
talking
about
how
you
acquire
a
mineral
claim,
it
is
a
prudent
man
thinking
that
there
is
valuable
mineral
in
place
on
the
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
your
water
claim,
under
most
western
state
appropriative
systems,
it
does
not
depend
upon
value.
it
depends
upon
prior
and
beneficial
use.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
there
had
been
many
mining
patents
obtained
on
the
basis
of
discovery
of
water?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
really,
that
is
all
the
government
has
to
go
on,
on
a
case
like
this.
in
that
case
the
sand
and
gravel
amendments
in
’55,
sand
and
gravel
were
recognized
as
patentable
minerals.
they
had
record
of
abuses.
here,
apparently,
your
clients
are
the
first
ones
to
have
successfully
tried
this
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
case
does
not
turn
in
any
way
on
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
not
turn
at
all
on
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
the
reservation
doctrine
is
not
involved
in
california
against
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
earth-qua-earth
is
a
mineral?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it,
because
it
is
not
a
mineral?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it
is
not
a
mineral?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
got
to
show
us
some
way
to
tell
why
water
is
and
earth
is
not,
other
than
just
saying
that
it
has
to
be
valuable.
because,
certainly,
by
the
standard
of
value
you
can
say
that
a
20-acre
plaster
claim
consisting
solely
of
earth
is
valuable
by
the
prudent
man
standards.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oil
was
a
mineral
for
those
purposes?
