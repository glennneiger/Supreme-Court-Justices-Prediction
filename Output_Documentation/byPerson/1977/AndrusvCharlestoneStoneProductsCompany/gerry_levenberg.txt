mr.
gerry
levenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
government
makes
too
much
of
sections
9
and
17
of
the
1866
and
1870
provisions
of
the
mining
laws.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
your
honor,
he
certainly
was
so
regarded.
he
discussed
those
provisions
at
some
length
in
the
opinion
as
we
acknowledged
in
our
brief.
but,
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
that
decision
suggests
that
the
court
did
not,
in
fact,
hold
that
the
sole
means
by
which
water
rights
could
be
obtained,
under
the
mining
laws
were
by
appropriation
under
the
state
laws.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
do
not
think
that
is
unfair
to
say
either,
your
honor.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
what
we
try
to
say
is
that,
as
we
set
forth
in
the
brief
especially
at
pages
16
through
18,
that
what
was
involved
in
beaver
portland
were
not
claims
under
the
mining
laws
of
1866,
1870,
or
1872.
there
were
two
separate
claims
to
water
by
two
private
parties,
one
under
the
homestead
act
of
1862
and
the
other
under
the
oregon
state
water
code.
the
court
concluded
and
held
in
that
case,
the
provision
of
the
dessert
land
act
meant.
it
did
not
hold,
we
submit,
that
the
only
means
by
which
water
could
be
obtained
under
the
mining
laws
was
by
state’s
appropriation.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
in
so
far
as
dessert
land
act
entries,
homestead
act
entries,
preemption
act
entries
were
concerned,
that
is
precisely
what
justice
sutherland
said.
he
was
a
man
who,
as
you
pointed
out,
wrote
quite
carefully.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
justice
sutherland’s
opinion
and
the
government
points
to
none
which
states
specifically
that
with
respect
to
claims
under
the
mining
laws,
and
that
is
what
is
involved
here,
with
respect
to
those
claims
the
sole
means
by
which
water
may
be
obtained
is
under
state
appropriation.
there
was
no
edict
from
this
court,
if
you
please,
which
said
“henceforth,
mining
act
patents
shall
savor
land
from
water.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
obviously,
your
honor,
we
would
have
preferred
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
spell
out
in
greater
detail
the
basis
for
its
holding.
we
do
wish
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
are
not
contending,
as
the
government
appears
to
attribute
to
us,
that
with
respect
to
vested
water
rights,
pursuant
to
section
9
of
the
1866
act
and
section
17
of
the
1870
act,
that
rights
which
have
already
vested
and
rights
which
vest
tomorrow
should
not
be
protected.
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position,
very
simply,
is
that
the
plain
language
of
the
act
of
1872,
which
states
that
all
valuable
minerals
maybe
discovered,
is
what
congress
meant
to
say
and
in
the
absence
of
a
withdrawal
by
congress,
as
you
pointed
out
and
as
the
government
points
out
and
it
did
in
1955
when
it
removed
certain
common
variety
minerals,
in
the
absence
of
a
withdrawal
from
the
broad
provisions
of
the
1872
act
of
specified
minerals
that
that
general
grant
of
authority
prevails.
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
rights
that
have
already
vested,
and
that
is
the
language
of
section
9
and
that
is
the
language
of
section
17,
rights
which
have
vested
and
accrued.
those
rights
remain
vested
and
accrued,
and
nothing
that
this
court
could
decide
in
this
case
by
affirming
the
lower
court’s
opinion
would
derogate
from
those
vested
rights.
the
government
argues
that
it
would
leave
an
unmanageable
system.
the
government
does
not
explain
why
the
system
is
any
more
manageable
today
in
circumstances
where
a
state
appropriation
with
respect
to
a
given
portion
of
water
that
runs
during
particular
times
of
the
year
or
particular
specified
flow
and
relieves
to
be
claimed
what
is
left
of
that
residual
of
rights
under
state
law
is
any
more
manageable.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
correct.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
our
point
is,
again,
in
response
to
the
parade
of
horribles
that
the
federal
government
sets
forth
in
this
case
that
would
prevail
if
we
prevail.
the
answer
to
that
is,
in
our
view,
that
the
very
requirement
that
a
demonstration
be
made
that
the
mineral
is
valuable,
the
very
requirement
of
the
prudent
man
test,
the
very
requirement
of
the
marketability
test
is
sufficient
to
insulate
claims
that
would
lead
to
abuse.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that,
of
course,
the
tests
are
different
under
a
state
appropriation
and
under
the
mining
laws
of
1872.
but
that
does
not,
in
our
view,
lead
inexorably
to
the
conclusion
as
the
government
would
have
it
that
when
congress
said
in
1866
and
in
1870
that
“we
will
respect
those
water
rights
that
have
vested
and
accrued
under
state
law,”
that
it
was
saying
that
that
was
the
only
manner
in
which
water
rights
could
be
obtained.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
support
for
that.
we
do
not
think
that
mr.
justice
sutherland
and
this
court
decided
that
issue
in
the
beaver
portland
case.
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
about
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
interior
department
does
not
take
into
account
that,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
while
construction
of
legislation
by
departments
charged
with
administering
the
legislation
is
indeed
entitled
the
deference.
this
court
is
not,
thereby,
permitted
to
abdicate
its
function
of
reviewing
the
wisdom
and
correctness
of
that
interpretation.
in
particular,
i
cite
the
court
to
a
decision,
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan
in
zuber
v.
allen,
396us
109
at
328.
the
abuse
argument
that
is
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
the
government,
seems
to
me,
was
indeed
answered,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
by
what
congress
did
in
the
1955
act.
when
it
was
confronted
with
circumstances
which
demonstrated
that
abuses
of
the
mining
law
had
been
taken
place,
the
congress
responded
and
it
did
so
on
the
basis
of
evidence
before
it,
not
on
the
basis
of
allegations
about
the
horrible
things
that
will
happen,
that
might
happen,
that
could
happen
if
this
court
interprets
the
law,
as
it
appears
to
us,
to
be
written.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
sir.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
that
appears
to
be
the
case.
i
am
suggesting,
to
you,
sir,
that
the
argument
that
a
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
a
given
way
in
order
to
avoid
the
prospect
of
abuse
should
not
prevail
here.
if
that
is
an
argument
that
ought
to
be
presented
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
when
as
and
if
facts
are
developed
to
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
political
body
that
its
law
ought
to
be
amended.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
your
honor,
as
the
government
points
out,
neither
party
neither
briefed
nor
argued.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
not
accidentally
but
at
least
inadvertently.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
buzzer,
mr.
justice
white,
you
were
asking
whether
we
came
to
this
claim
by
inadvertence
or
accident.
as
indicated,
the
issue
that
is
briefed
here
was
not
briefed
below,
but
i
do
invite
to
your
attention
from
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari.
a
description
by
the
court
below
of
the
nature
of
our
location
notices,
i
quote
each
of
the
location
notices
covering
claims
1
through
22
described
a
“piece
of
mineral-bearing
ground
as
a
plaster
claim”
as
distinguished
from
a
claim
location
of
any
particular
mineral,
either
surface
or
underground
within
that
tract
of
ground.
but,
it
is
true
that
the
matters
that
are
being
briefed
and
argued
here
were
not
briefed
or
argued
below.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
address
a
more
fundamental
question
that
you
posed
this
morning
to
counsel
for
the
government.
that
is,
whether
the
government’s
position
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
government’s
position
in
california
versus
the
united
states.
the
government,
not
surprisingly,
says
“of
course,
it
is
not.
we
think
it
clearly
is.
the
government
argues
in
california
versus
the
united
states
that
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
which
it
describes
in
its
brief
in
this
case
as
similar
in
nature
to
section
9
and
section
17
of
the
mining
laws.
the
government
takes
the
position
in
california
versus
the
united
states
as
it
has
in
virtually
every
case
involving
section
8,
that
in
spite
of
the
language
written
by
congress
in
the
reclamation
act
protecting
the
state’s
concerns
and
interests
with
respect
to
water.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
and
despite
the
dessert
land
act.
a
narrow
reading
of
section
8
is
required,
whereas,
in
this
case
the
broadest
conceivable
reading
of
section
9
and
section
17
is
required.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
turns
on
the
language
in
section
1
of
the
mining
law
of
1872
which
says
“all
valuable
minerals
except
as
otherwise
implied.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
we
are
not
basing
our
claim
on
the
reclamation
act.
we
do
address
in
our
brief
but
we
regard
to
be
the
government’s
inconsistent
positions
with
respect
to
what
it
now
calls
an
unmanageable
dual
system
brought
about,
i
assume,
or
that
would
be
brought
about
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
we
suggest
to
you
most
respectfully
that
the
unmanageable
dual
system
that
the
government
so
fears
as
a
result
of
this
case,
it
fosters
and
presses
in
particular
in
the
reservation
doctrine
cases
and
in
particular
in
the
case
that
is
pending
before
this
court
and
that
will
be
argued
next
week
in
new
mexico
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
it
is
not.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
is
not.
i
was
moving
on
from
what
we
regard
to
be
the
inconsistency
of
the
government’s
position
with
respect
to
its
attitude
that
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act,
although
it
purports
to
protect
state
interest,
must
be
read
very
narrowly,
whereas,
the
language
of
section
9
and
section
17
of
the
mining
laws,
the
government
argued,
should
be
read
in
its
broadest
terms
and
going
beyond,
as
we
see
it,
the
protection
of
vested
rights.
the
government,
in
its
brief
in
this
case
at
page
20,
in
a
footnote
refers
to
the
federal
power
act
as
another
example
of
the
kind
of
act
that
was
based
upon
the
sort
of
concerns
the
government
perceives
in
section
9
and
section
17
of
the
mining
laws.
the
fact
is
that
this
court
in,
first
isle
made
it
very
had
clear
and
this
court
in
arizona
versus
california
confirmed
that
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act
upon
which
the
government,
in
two
ways
adverts
in
its
brief,
was
no
more
than
a
saving
clause.
i
now
quote
from
footnote
93
of
this
court’s
decision
in
arizona
versus
california,
c1
isle
“where
this
court
limited
the
effect
of
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act
which
expressly
saved
certain
state
laws
to
vested
property
rights.
that
is
precisely
the
position
that
we
take
here.
that
is
what
at
issue
here
in
our
judgment.
the
extent
to
which,
state
water
rights
are
to
be
protected
under
the
mining
laws
of
1872,
as
congress
has
so
clearly
said,
are
vested
state
rights.
we
do
not
argue,
and
as
the
government
would
like
to
attribute
to
us,
that
those
rights
must
have
vested
prior
to
1866
or
prior
to
1870.
we
say
that
they
could
vest
tomorrow
so
long
as
they
vested
prior
to
the
discovery
of
water
as
a
locatable
mineral
under
the
law
of
1872.
with
respect
to
the
government’s
position
in
so
far
as
the
reservation
doctrine
is
concerned,
we
think
that
it
is
worth
inviting
to
the
court’s
attention
contrary
to
the
argument
that
was
made
earlier
by
the
government
of
no
inconsistency,
what
the
holder
of
mining
claims
in
the
gila
forest
that
is
involved
in
the
new
mexico
case
to
be
argued
next
week.
it
views
the
government’s
position,
in
that
case,
is
contrasted
to
the
government’s
position
articulated
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
specifically
at
page
23
of
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
molycorp
in
77-510
to
be
argued
next
week.
it
is
stated,
in
charlestone
the
government
argues
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
“would
cast
doubts
on
rights
long
thought
to
be
established
under
state
and
local
law,
and
would
unsettle
the
law
of
water
rights
in
the
western
states.
that
is
a
quote
from
the
government’s
brief
in
this
case.
we
agree,
but
find
the
government’s
position
there
to
be
irreconcilable
with
its
position
in
this
case.
here,
the
government
argues,
in
new
mexico,
that
private
water
rights
which
have
evolved
over
the
last
100
years
should
be
subjected
to
an
undefined
reserved
water
right
of
the
united
states,
cited
in
the
us
brief
in
the
new
mexico
case
at
page
30.
although
the
government
does
not
address
the
consequences
of
its
assertion,
it
follows
from
the
government’s
claim
for
reserve
water
for
the
present
and
future
needs,
citation
of
the
government’s
brief
of
the
federal
forest
for
“aesthetics,
recreation,
etcetera.
that
the
very
same
rights
which
the
government
seeks
to
preserve
in
charlestone
will
be
seriously
undermined
if
its
position
here
is
accepted.
we
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
dual
management
system,
which
the
government
contends,
would
be
brought
about
by
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
below
is
here.
it
is
already
here.
the
government
makes
a
reservation
claim
of
an
unquantified,
undetermined
amount.
there
are
interests
that
it
seeks
to
protect
in
that
case
that
are
private
interests.
the
government’s
brief
there
points
out
that
it
has
issued
1600
permits
to
cattle
grazers
to
run
29,000
cattle
through
the
force.
those
are
private
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
invent
or
create
the
dual
management
system.
congress
did,
with
respect
to
mining
rights
in
the
1872
law.
congress
said
“all
valuable
minerals
may
be
subject
to
location,
and
the
lands
thereon
subject
to
purchase.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
that
is
conceivable.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
the
case,
mr.
justice
white.
it
strikes
me
from
my
reading.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
they
have
not
done
that.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
but
they
have
made
the
decision,
so
far
as
i
am
aware
of,
in
the
context
of
reference
to
section
9
and
section
17
that
water
rights
are
something
to
be
taken
care
of
under
state
law.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
we
think
that
while,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
judicial
authority
on
that
is
really
quite
sparse.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
there
is
not
very
much
on
it.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
we
argue,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
sound
authority
for
our
position,
that
water
is
a
mineral,
that
it
was
regarded
by
the
congress
as
a
mineral,
and
that
the
question
whether
water
is
a
locatable
mineral
really
depends
upon
whether
those
who
claim
it
can
demonstrate
that
it
is
valuable
which
is
a
keyword,
as
we
see
it,
in
the
1872
law.
that
demonstration
and
that
issue
has
very
well
articulated
standards
that
have
been
set
forth
by
this
court
and
followed
by
the
interior.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
gas
and
oil
were
dealt
with
separately
under
separate
statutes.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
the
mining
law
of
1872?
no,
because
the
mining
law
of
1872
begins
with
the
language
“except
as
otherwise
provided”
then
there
are
specific
identifiable
statutes
that
deal
with
the
discovery
of
gas
and
oil
as
there
are
with
respect
to
the
discovery
of
coal
and
potassium
and
phosphate,
and
a
number
of
other
minerals.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
am
sorry,
but
not
locatable
minerals
under
mining
law
of
1872.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
the
government
argues
that
that
is
the
inexorable
consequence
of
this
court
affirming
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
below.
no,
i
would
not
say
that
earth-qua-earth
is
a
locatable
mineral.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
gerry
levenberg
the
standard
still
is
whether
it
is
a
valuable
mineral
and
in
the
context
of
the
claim
that
has
been
made.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
am
sure
that
it
was.
we
do
not
claim
nor
do
you
have
to
decided
in
this
case
that
earth
is
a
locatable
mineral.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
that
is
certainly
conceivable,
your
honor.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
very,
very
little
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1872
mining
laws.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
there
is
no
evidence
that
water
was
not
regarded
as
a
mineral,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
think
that
it
is
as
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
attention
that
the
congress
devoted
to
water
by
excluding
those
vested
water
rights
within
the
mining
laws
is
evident
that
congress
indeed
regard
water
to
be
a
mineral.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
answer.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
i
may
well
have
done
that.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
the
ninth
circuit,
again,
in
another
case,
in
which
cert
was
denied
in
this
court
in
the
geothermal
steam
case.
in
fact,
it
concluded
that
water
is
a
mineral.
that
is
a
case
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
is
being
challenged
here
was
relied
upon.
that
is
the
union
oil
case.
i
do
not
know
what
the
dictionary
says
about
water.
mr.
gerry
levenberg
no,
i
would
not
think
that
it
does.
i
think
that
the
best
evidence
that
there
is
that
the
congress
regarded
water
as
a
mineral
in
the
mining
laws
is
the
fact
that
it
was
concerned
to
be
sure
that
those
local
customs
of
the
states
and
territories
in
so
far
as
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
to
that
time
were
protected
in
1866
and
the
1870
acts.
i
would
leave
it
there.
