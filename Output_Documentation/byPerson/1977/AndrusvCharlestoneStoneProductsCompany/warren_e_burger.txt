the

against
charlestone
stone
products.
mrs.

think
you
may
proceed.

burger
mrs.
beale,
may
i
suggest
you
draw
the
microphone
a
little
closer
to
you.
thank
you.
chief

we
will
resume
there

counsel.
counsel,
you
may
continue.
chief

e.
burger
sparse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
reasonable
that,
as
the
court
has
often
said,
that
we
read
legislation
in
terms
of
what
the
ordinary
meaning
given
by
ordinary
people
to
the
words
used
at
the
time
they
were
used?
in
â€™72,
did
they
regard
water
as
a
mineral?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
that
it
was
regarded
as
a
mineral?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
give
you
a
little
help.
i
looked
at
five
of
them
and
none
of
them
included
water,
and
all
of
them
had
a
common
denominator
of
solids
as
its
meaning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
there
are
minerals
in
suspension
in
water
or
minerals
in
suspension
in
other
fluids,
but
does
that
make
water
per
se
a
mineral?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mrs.
beale,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
a
dictionary
in
front
of
me
and
it
seems
to
fall
well
within
this
definition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
