the
trans
alaska
pipeline
rates
cases
which
i
hear
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
when
the
trans
alaska
pipeline
was
completed,
seven
of
its
eight
oil
company
owners
filed
their
tariffs
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
setting
out
initial
rates
and
the
rules
to
govern
transportation
of
oil
over
from
prudhoe
bay
and
alaskan
arctic
to
the
all-weather
port
of
valdez
on
alaska's
pacific
coast.
the
rates
were
met
immediately
by
several
formal
protests
that
there
were
excessive
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
acting
under
section
15
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
suspended
the
rates
for
the
full
seven
months
allowed
by
that
section
because
the
commission
found
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest,
if
the
system
closed
for
seven
months.
the
commission
estimated
rates
that
approximated
what
its
judgment
full
investigation
would
likely
reveal
to
be
lawful
rates
and
stated
that
it
would
not
suspend
interim
rates
that
specified
rates
no
higher
than
those
estimated.
however,
since
the
estimated
rates
might
still
"exceed
reasonable
levels,"
the
commission
also
stated
that
any
interim
tariffs
must
provide
for
refunds
of
any
amounts
found
later
to
be
in
excess
of
lawful
rates.
and
on
petition
for
review,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
commission
action
and
rejected
as
without
merit,
three
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners
here.
first,
that
the
commission
had
no
statutory
authority
under
section
15
(7)
to
suspend
initial
rates,
but
authority
only
to
suspend
changes
in
existing
tariffs.
second,
that
the
commission
had
no
statutory
authority
ancillary
to
the
suspension
power
to
set
out
without
an
adjudicatory
hearing
maximum
interim
rates
which
it
would
allow
to
go
into
effect
during
the
suspension
period
and
third
and
finally
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
condition
a
decision
not
to
suspend
tariffs
on
a
requirement
that
the
carriers,
tariffs
were
allowed
to
go
into
effect
be
prepared
to
make
refunds
of
any
amounts
collected
whether
under
initially
proposed
or
interim
tariffs
which
were
later
determined
after
full
hearing
to
be
unlawful.
we
in
agreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit,
also
find
no
merit
in
these
arguments
of
petitioners
and
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decision
of
these
cases.
