justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
the
last
sentence
of
section
15-7
without
having
to
refer
to
it?
the
sentence
beginning
at
any
hearing
involving
a
change
in
a
rate,
fare,
charge,
or
classification?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
when
that
sentence
refers
to
a
hearing
involving
a
change
in
a
rate,
fare,
charge,
or
classification
it
is,
in
effect,
defining
what
a
new
rate
means?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
and
we
so
contend,
your
honor.
the
word
“initial”
is
really
misleading
because
it
tends
to
suggest
exclusively
synonymous
with
the
word
“original”
and
that
is
not
the
way
the
agency
uses
the
word
“initial.”
the
word
“initial”
can
be
an
initial
filing
and
filing
of
an
initial
schedule
that
can
contain
the
old
rate.
that
is
why
we
further
contend
that
the
other
statutes
within
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
you
would.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
effect
on
the
type
of
business
that
you
are
talking
about
if
the
icc
had
the
power
or
the
ferc
had
the
power
to
suspend
rates
but
not
to
fix
interim
rates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
rate
filed
would
be
suspended
and,
unless
the
carrier
came
in
and
filed
a
new
rate
that
was
not
suspended,
there
would
be
no
tariff
he
was
permitted
to
charge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
that
does
not
occur,
i
take
it,
where
the
ferc
or
icc
suspends
a
changed
rate
because
there
is
already
a
rate
in
effect
which
is
either
been
found
to
be
reasonable
or
which
at
least
has
not
been
suspended.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
really
is
the
fixing
of
the
interim
rate
rather
than
the
suspension
that
would
constitute
the
prejudgment,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
beyond
the
commission’s
statutory
powers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
motor
carrier
has
to
get
a
certificate
to
operate
without
regard
to
its
terms,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kilcarr,
in
section
15-7
of
49usc,
i
see
the
language
“new
rate”
used
and
i
see
the
language
change
in
a
rate
used.
it
is
a
long
section.
i
glanced
over
it.
i
do
not
see
the
word
“original”
or
“initial”
used
in
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
words
of
art
or
do
they
come
from
some
other
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
initial
could
be
just
one
of
many
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
you
are
not
arguing
that
just
because
it
is
not
unfair
the
commission
must
have
the
power,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
that
that
is
a
preservation
of
status
quo
or
it
is
something
bigger
and
better
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
simple
suspension
of
the
rates
here,
in
this
particular
case,
without
any
interim
rates
preserve
the
status
quo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
thing
is
simply
delayed
for
seven
months.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happens
at
the
end
supposing
that
you
are
right,
there
is
a
suspension
power
and
the
commission
suspends
for
seven
months.
the
carriers
do
not,
in
the
meantime,
propose
a
rate
that
satisfies
the
commission.
at
the
end
of
the
seven-month
period,
does
the
rate
originally
filed
go
into
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
a
rollover
type
of
thing
like
the
scc
claimed
in
the
earlier
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
changed
rate
represents
a
departure
from
a
rate
which
is
presumably
been
found
reasonable
before,
does
it
not?
does
it
not
have
more
going
against
it
than
a
new
rate
which
has
never
been
found
either
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
not
assume
that
if
had
been
unreasonable,
icc
would
have
suspended
it
or
caused
an
investigation
to
be
made
into
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
on
whom
is
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
suspension
of
a
new
rate
under
15-7?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
the
way
the
commission
proceeds
under
the
last
sentence
of
15-7,
where
you
are
talking
about
a
change
in
a
rate,
fare,
or
classification
and
the
way
it
proceeds
when
it
is
talking
about
what
you
would
describe
as
a
new
rate
and
which
you
say
is
different
and
broader
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
speaking
of
the
last
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
the
transportation
act
there
was
changed
to
the
date.
i
thought
that
was
the
last
sentence
of
the
mann
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
was
the
last
sentence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
the
beginning,
at
any
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
commission
proceed
differently?
as
i
take
it,
under
your
analysis,
it
would
have
to
if
a
change
in
a
rate
or
fare
is
a
much
narrower
category
of
things,
and
then
the
filing
of
a
new
rate.
how
does
it
proceed
differently
when
it
is
going
about
suspending
a
changed
rate
than
a
new
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
passed
25
years
later.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
that
means
the
same
thing
as
new
rate,
does
it
not,
under
your
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
in
the
mann
act
did
they
used
the
word
“new”
in
one
sentence
and
“changed
rate”
in
another
sentence
of
the
same
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kilcarr.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
that
you
know
of,
other
than
tradition,
which
would
prevent
the
icc
or
the
ferc
in
a
15-1
proceeding
from
holding
it
on
an
expedited
basis
and
having
witnesses
and
findings?
