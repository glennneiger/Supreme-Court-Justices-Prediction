mr.
richard
j.
flynn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
points
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
are
independent
of
your
decision
on
the
suspension
power.
like
judge
roni,
i
will
assume,
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
that
the
commission
did
have
power
to
suspend
the
rates.
it
is
our
position
that
the
order
is
still
unlawful
because
of
the
prescription
of
rates
and
the
imposition
of
the
refund
conditions.
we
start
off,
i
think,
with
less
disagreement
on
certain
fundamental
parts
of
the
law
among
the
parties.
our
opponents
concede
that
you
cannot
prescribe
a
rate
under
15-7
or
15-1
without
a
hearing.
they
argue
that
there
was
no
prescription.
the
court
below
held
expressly
that
its
imposition
of
refund
conditions
did
not
arise
under
the
power
in
15-7,
which
is
expressly
limited
to
increases
in
rates.
they
found
both
the
power
to
state
the
interim
rate
and
the
power
to
impose
refund
conditions
not
only
on
the
interim
rate,
but
on
the
originally
filed
rates
to
arise
as
valid
corollaries
of
the
suspension
power.
our
opponents
here
not
only
support
that
but
say,
if
they
had
the
suspension
power,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
you
cannot
look
at
what
they
did
under
those
valid
corollaries.
to
submit
that
there
is
plenty
of
law
in
this
court
and
elsewhere
that
you
cannot
review
a
refusal
of
the
commission
to
suspend
because
this
court
has
held
that
courts
have
been
deprived
of
the
injunctive
power
in
that
area.
but,
i
find
no
case
that
says
you
cannot
review
an
exercise
of
suspension
power.
i
think
that
statute
makes
it
clear
because
it
says
if
the
commission
refuses
to
suspend,
it
does
not
have
to
say
anything.
but
if
decides
to
suspend,
it
has
to
state
the
reasons
therefore.
to
me,
that
is
consistent
with
review.
here,
the
commission
itself
has
said
that
when
you
set
the
interim
rates,
they
did
not
set
them
with
regard
to
anything
that
was
going
to
happen.
the
only
period
in
which
they
could
apply,
the
interim
period,
will
not
let
back
for
reconsideration
and
they
said
“we
know
these
rates
are
going
to
be
right
for
the
interim
period.
we
knew
that
when
we
did
it
and
we
know,
even
more
strongly
now,
that
your
pump
station
eight
is
off
and
you
will
not
have
any
throughput,
but
that
does
not
matter.”
yet,
our
opponents
say
“you
cannot
review
that
kind
of
an
interim
rate.”
even
if
they
have
had
a
decent
rate,
it
would
be
unlawful.
the
sole
reliance
for
the
power
to
prescribe
and
the
power
to
impose
refunds
is
on
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
decision.
the
court
below
and
our
opponents
interpret
that
decision
as
saying
“you
cannot
impose
any
kind
of
a
condition
you
want.”
on
but
to
refuse
to
exercise
the
suspension
power?
when,
of
course,
we
started
off
here,
they
did
not
refuse
to
exercise
the
suspension
power.
they
exercised
it,
they
say.
but,
clearly,
this
court
did
not
give
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
its
successor,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
that
kind
of
a
license.
the
chessie
case
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
narrowest
decisions
that
has
come
from
this
court.
all
that
you
did
was
the
obvious
thing
of
telling
railroads
came
in
and
asked
for
a
10%
increase
in
rates,
and
admitted
they
could
only
justify
3%
of
it
on
the
basis
of
cost
and
they
wanted
the
other
7%
to
catch
up
on
deferred
maintenance.
that
if
it
was
all
right
for
the
commission
to
tell
them
that
if
they
were
to
get
the
money,
they
had
to
spend
it
for
what
they
said
they
wanted
it
for.
that,
certainly,
is
not
a
rate-setting
decision.
the
carriers
set
the
rates
themselves.
the
commission
did
not
alter
their
rates.
they
accepted
them.
i
think
the
difference
between
that
case
and
what
we
have
here
is
made
clear
by
reference
to
a
couple
of
other
decisions,
one
of
this
court’s.
in
scrap
i
the
appellants
or
the
respondents
were
attempting
to
convert
the
carrier-made
rates
there
and
the
commission-made
rates
by
arguing
that
the
commission
had
imposed
a
condition
on
the
rate.
in
that
case,
there
was
another
general
rate
increase.
they
asked
for
an
emergency
2.5%
increase
until
they
could
get
around
to
filing
selective
rates.
the
commission
attached
to
that
a
condition
that
they
include
an
expiration
date
so
that
those
rates
would
expire
when
the
selective
rate
increases
came
in.
this
court
said
that
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
did
not
convert
those
carrier-made
rates
into
commission-made
rates.
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
came
out
on
march
13th,
it
is
number
75-2143,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
was
dealing
with
a
request
that
they
imposed
a
condition
on
a
rate
that
they
had
a
right
to
set.
it
was
a
rate
for
voluntary
wheeling
of
electricity,
moving
electricity
from
one
system
to
another.
richmond
power
company
said
“that
is
great,”
but
hold
that
rate
to
be
unreasonable
unless
the
carriers
agree
to
continue
wheeling
even
involuntarily.
the
commission
looked
at
the
statute
and
looked
at
the
history,
and
said
“congress
expressly
declined
to
give
us
the
power
to
impose
involuntary
wheeling
and,
therefore,
that
kind
of
a
condition
is
unlawful.”
that
is
what
we
have
here.
congress
expressly
denied
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
the
power
to
set
a
rate
without
a
hearing.
it
expressly
refused
to
give
them
the
power
to
establish
refund
conditions
except
in
the
case
of
increased
rates.
these
are
wholly
beyond
their
power
and
you
cannot,
as
this
court
has
said
so
many
times,
do
indirectly
through
conditions
which
are
expressly
prohibited
from
doing
directly.
mr.
richard
j.
flynn
they
did
not
withhold
that
power.
they
did
not
have
a
contrary
provision
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
flynn
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
stand
here
and
contend
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
power
to
impose
any
conditions
regardless
of
what
they
are
on
the
exercise
of
one
of
its
other
powers.
all
i
ask
you
to
find,
as
you
have
done
before,
is
that
if
the
statute
says
“you
have
got
to
have
a
hearing
to
set
a
rate,”
then
they
cannot
set
a
rate
without
a
hearing
as
a
condition
of
their
suspension
power.
if
the
statute
says
“you
can
only
fix
refund
conditions
on
increased
rates,”
then
you
cannot
impose
refund
conditions
on
rates
that
are
not
increased
rates
as
a
condition
of
the
exercise
of
the
suspension
power.
mr.
richard
j.
flynn
no,
it
is
not.
i
am
referring
to
the
language
of
15-7
which
says
“in
the
case
of
an
increased
rate,
the
commission
may
require
the
carriers
to
keep
account
and
to
make
refunds.”
mr.
richard
j.
flynn
yes,
sir.
i
share
mr.
kilcarr’s
views
there
and
that
they
did
not
have
the
power
to
suspend
in
the
first
place.
mr.
richard
j.
flynn
that
is
right.
if
he
is
right,
i
do
not
have
to
make
these
arguments
because
these
two
actions
collapse
with
their
own
weight.
the
other
case,
that
i
guess
we
rely
on
is
the
moss
case
from
the
dc
circuit,
which
is
remarkably
similar
to
this
except
that
nobody
alleges
that
what
this
commission
did
was
done
in
consultation
with
the
industry
or
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
industry.
that
case
just
is
in
this.
the
commission
had
a
suspension
procedure
which
was
summering,
and
require
evidence,
they
held
an
argument,
they
issued
an
order,
they
suspended
the
rates
that
have
been
filed,
and
they
spelled
out
in
detail
a
whole
rate
plan
and
announced
that
they
would
not
suspend
it.
the
evil
found
there
by
the
court
was
that,
under
that
act
that
insulated
those
rates
from
judicial
review,
the
rates
were
not
suspended.
they
went
into
effect
and
there
was
no
order
of
the
cab
which
would
be
reviewable.
here,
the
commission
held
an
argument,
suspended
the
rates,
and
then
announced
that
it
would
not
suspend
precise
rates
rather
than
a
rate
scheme.
the
contention
here
is
that
you
cannot
review
that.
that
was
the
intention.
it
was
to
get
a
rate
in,
a
lower
rate
for
a
seven-month
period,
and
insulate
it
from
your
review.
the
court
in
moss
found
that
was
a
prescription
of
a
rate.
it
was
not
advice.
the
court
below
did
not
find
that.
but,
clearly,
it
should
have.
there
was
nothing
more
coercive
than
this
rate.
you
had
a
$9-billion
pipeline
sitting
there.
you
had
oil
starting
to
run
in
and
you
had
a
congressional
mandate
to
get
the
oil
to
the
lower
48
as
fast
as
you
could.
you
had
this
ongoing
energy
crisis
in
this
country.
the
commission
knew,
as
judge
roni
said,
that
there
was
not
any
doubt
if
they
put
up
that
interim
rate
the
carriers
would
have
to
file
it.
that
is
a
prescription
of
a
rate.
thank
you.
