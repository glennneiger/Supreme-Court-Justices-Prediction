mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
good
morning,
your
honors.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
in
early
1969
and
shortly
after
the
discovery
of
oil
on
the
north
slope
of
alaska,
planning
commenced
to
build
a
pipeline
that
would
reach
from
the
arctic
ocean
in
the
location
of
prudhoe
bay,
800
miles
south
to
the
port
of
valdez
on
the
gulf
of
alaska.
after
overcoming
numerous
engineering
design
and
environmental
obstacles,
the
trans
alaska
pipeline
system,
indeed,
taps
was
constructed.
taps
is
a
unique
feat
of
engineering.
alone,
it
costs
$9
billion.
but,
it
is
unique
also,
your
honors,
because
it
took
two
acts
of
congress
to
get
it
started,
the
alaska
native
claims
act
which
settled
aboriginal
land
claims
by
alaskan
natives
and,
of
course,
the
trans-alaskan
pipeline
authorization
act
passed
in
november
of
1973
which
effectively
disposed
of
that
massive
environmental
litigation
which
had
delayed
the
project
from
its
very
inception.
the
taps
situation,
your
honors,
is
also
unique
because
the
regulatory
treatment
afforded
it.
it
was
subjected
to
an
unprecedented
rate-making
and
suspension
water.
i
say
unprecedented
because
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
the
90-year
history
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
to
put
that
order
and
the
activities
of
the
icc
in
perspective,
one
point
should
be
emphasized.
that
is,
though
in
fact,
this
is
a
single
pipeline,
it
is,
in
law,
eight
separate
pipelines.
this
results
from
the
decision
on
the
part
of
the
owners
to
form
an
ownership
of
the
line
on
the
basis
of
undivided
interest.
so
that
as
a
result,
we
are
looking
at
eight
common
carriers
that
are
required
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
fill
the
capacity
of
their
share
of
the
line
as
common
carriers
and,
thus,
are
subjected
to
all
the
responsibilities
of
the
act
as
well
as
all
of
the
rights
given
to
a
common
carrier
under
the
act.
in
that
context,
the
eight
owners
of
the
trans
alaska
pipeline
formulated
their
independently
calculated
tariffs
for
submission
pursuant
to
section
6-1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
early
june.
for
example,
mobil
alaska
filed
its
tariff
on
june
10th
to
be
effective
june
20th
and,
at
the
request
of
the
icc,
it
postponed
the
effective
date
until
the
30th
of
june.
the
point
to
be
emphasized
here,
and
at
this
point,
is
that
the
calculation
of
these
eight
separate
tariffs
all
followed
a
methodology
that
had
prevailed
in
the
industry
for
35
years.
it
is
referred
to
repeatedly
in
the
briefs
as
the
consent
decree
approach
to
rate
determination,
which
is
referenced
to
the
atlantic
refining
case
that
was
settled
by
consent
decree
in
1941.
it
was
in
elkins
act
case.
the
case
was
or
the
aspects
of
that
formulation
were
before
this
court
in
1959
in
atlantic
refining
versus
the
united
states.
very
basically,
what
that
consent
decree
requires
is
that
owners
of
pipelines
can
receive
no
more
than
7%
of
their
share
of
the
valuation
of
the
pipeline.
that
is
an
effective
limitation
on
what
can
be
paid
out
of
the
rate
of
return
of
the
pipeline.
that
is
how
these
rates
were
independently
calculated.
following
submission
of
the
tariffs,
again,
pursuant
to
section
6-1,
there
occurred
the
issuance
of
an
order
by
the
icc
in
indicating
that
on
june
27th
a
summary
proceeding
to
consider
possible
suspension
of
the
tariffs
would
be
conducted
by
that
agency
and
that,
contrary
to
past
practice,
the
entire
commission
would
sit
en
banc
in
the
proceeding
and
not
a
suspension
board
or
some
intermediate
board.
the
issuance
of
that
notice
of
summary
proceeding
resulted
in
four
protests
being
filed
in
writing
with
the
agency.
one
by
the
justice
department,
another
by
the
state
of
alaska,
one
by
an
organization
representing
alaskan
natives,
and
the
fourth
protest
by
the
icc’s
own
bureau
of
enforcement.
the
protestants
requested
suspension
of
the
filed
rates,
investigation
of
those
rates,
and
the
setting
of
interim
rates
in
recognition
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
shut
the
line
down.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
four
in
number.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
we
assumed
at
that
time,
your
honor,
it
was
recognized
by
all
that
the
situation
had
no
financial
impact,
that
is,
no
impact
on
the
end
price
of
the
oil,
if
you
would,
that
the
price
of
alaska
north
slope
oil
was
not
going
to
change
as
far
as
the
refinery
and,
ultimately,
the
consumer
for
petroleum
products
based
upon
this
tariff
dispute.
we
are
at
trial
right
now
in
the
rate
proceeding
before
the
ferc.
in
that
proceeding,
we
have
had
intervention
by
one
public
interest
group,
but
there
was
none
during
the
regulatory
phase.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
held
their
summary
proceeding.
it
was
characterized
or
described
by
the
agency
as
an
oral
argument
and,
that,
indeed
was
what
it
was.
it
took
place
on
june
27th
and,
in
that
connection,
the
owners
of
the
line
through
their
representatives
had
opportunity
to
try
in
very
summary
fashion
to
defend
the
calculation
on
the
basis
of
their
rate
submissions.
at
the
same
time,
there
was
opposition
in
that
argument
to
any
authority
on
the
part
of
that
agency
to
suspend
these
rates
or
to
set
interim
rates
during
the
seven
months
suspension
period.
the
very
next
day,
on
june
28th,
the
icc
issued
its
order.
in
that
order,
it
purported
to
do
and,
indeed,
in
fact
did
four
things.
it
suspended
the
rates
as
filed
by
the
carriers,
set
them
for
investigation,
set
interim
rates
as
to
which
the
carriers
could
file
on
one-day’s
notice,
and
those
interim
rates
were
substantially,
in
the
case
of
my
client,
23%
less
than
the
rate
as
originally
filed.
in
addition,
they
established
a
refund
provision
in
the
order,
making
the
filing
of
the
interim
rates
conditioned
upon
the
carriers’
undertaking
to
pay
back
the
difference
between
either
the
filed
rate,
the
interim
rate,
or
whatever
rate
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
the
reasonable
rate
in
accordance
with
the
investigation
ordered
in
the
same
order.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
the
area
of
june
10th
and
the
startup
time,
the
actual
loading
of
the
first
tanker
in
valdez
was
july
31st,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
realistically,
no,
your
honor,
because
this
was
a
new
entity
and
new
service.
the
line
was
under
construction
and
one
had
to
wait
until
at
least
they
had
some
reasonable
basis
to
determine
what
their
operating
would
be
and
what
their
construction
cost
would
be,
all
for
purposes
of
casting
the
rate
base
for
purposes
ultimately
of
determining
what
rate
of
return
in
accordance
with
the
consent
decree
formula.
admittedly,
when
the
tariffs
were
filed,
that
information
was
still
estimated
but
it
was
better
more
sophisticated
degree
of
estimation
and
it
would
be
seven
months
in
advance.
after
issuance
of
the
june
28th
order,
petitioners
sought
review
and
reversal
in
the
fifth
circuit.
a
divided
panel
of
that
circuit
found,
principally,
that
the
suspension
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
had
no
plain
meaning.
this
is
section
15-7
and
the
court’s
majority
found
that
since
there
was
no
plain
meaning
to
the
language
of
that
act.
that,
indeed,
the
agency
did
have
suspension
authority
and
further,
although
the
court
was
troubled,
it
appears
by
the
setting
of
these
interim
rates
concluded
or
reasoned
that
this
indeed
did
not
constitute
the
setting
of
an
interim
rate
but,
rather,
was
the
exercise
of
a
limited
waiver
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
agency
that
did
have
suspension
authority.
the
dissenting
judge,
circuit
judge
roni,
characterized
the
order,
in
our
opinion
respectfully,
your
honors,
it
was
for
what
it
was.
he
said
that
it
was
a
rate-making
order
and,
as
a
rate-making
order,
it
was
unlawful
and
it
did
not
comply
with
the
rate-making
procedures
and
provisions
explicated
in
section
15-1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
on
that
basis,
he
would
find
the
order
unlawful
and
he
did
not
have
to
consider
the
question
of
suspension.
we
are
here,
your
honors,
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
as
i
said,
we
are
already
at
trial
commenced
on
the
rate
proceeding
in
november.
since
that
time
we
have,
of
course,
received
from
this
court
a
stay
of
the
june
28th
order.
that
was
on
october
20th.
a
subsequent
order
was
ordered
superseding,
but
not
effectively
changing
the
stay.
that
second
order
was
on
november
14th.
your
honors,
as
to
the
suspension
or
alleged
suspension
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
now
of
course,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
because
jurisdiction
over
oil
pipelines
has
been
transferred
to
the
department
energy
bill
or
act
to
ferc.
we
have
analyzed
in
detail,
your
honors,
in
our
brief
the
conclusion
arrived
at
on
the
basis
of
the
analysis
of
the
section
15-7,
its
language,
the
underlying
legislative
history
of
that
statutory
provision,
prior
cases
by
the
agency
dealing
with
suspension
situations.
in
that
analysis
very
summarily,
your
honors,
we
point
out
the
essential
linkage
between
suspension
and
section
6-3
of
the
act
which
requires
30-day
notice
being
filed
before
any
changes
in
rates
and
it
is
the
essence
of
our
position
that
section
15-7
is
limited
to
changes
in
rates
or
tariffs
or
practices
affecting
rates.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
does.
that
is
the
language
of
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
our
position,
that
the
existence
of
a
prior
rate
is
what
allows
the
continuity
of
service,
the
maintenance
of
status
quo
when
the
suspension
takes
place,
and
the
proposed
change
or,
literally,
the
new
rate
is
examined
for
reasonableness
by
the
agency.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
we
so
argue,
your
honor,
that
when
that
language
came
into
the
act
in
1920,
it
was
brought
in
to
make
the
change
synonymous
with
the
early
use
of
“new
rate”
and
that,
as
we
characterized
it,
constituted
in
authoritative
gloss
upon
the
statute
as
originally
enacted
in
1910
by
the
congress
known
as
the
“mann-elkins
act.”
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
your
honor,
the
word
“initial.”
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i
think
there
is
an
ambiguity.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
right.
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
suggest
and
the
petitioners
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
concept
of
original
rate,
the
first
rate
for
a
new
service
on
a
new
entity,
was
beyond
the
whole
ambit
of
this
statutory
enactment.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
your
honor,
it
could
never
be
a
new
rate
in
the
statutory
sense
of
the
word
“new.”
it
would
always
be
an
original
rate.
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute,
we
suggest,
was
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
suspension
of
an
original
rate
on
a
new
service
and
a
new
entity
would
result
in
no
service
for
a
period
of
seven
months.
that,
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
case,
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
national
interest.
the
icc,
itself,
so
found
that
that
could
not
be
permitted.
thus,
in
exercising
their
alleged
authority
or
their
putative
authority,
they
had
to
do
something
and
that
is
where
we
get
the
interim
rate
coming
into
the
context
of
this
case.
the
interim
rate,
we
suggest,
stands
or
falls
here
only
if
the
suspension
authority
is
valid
because,
without
suspension
authority,
and
these
were
rates
make
no
mistake
about
it,
these
rates
were
found
absolutely
in
disregard
of
section
15-1
which
is
the
rate-making
provision
of
the
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
that
were
true,
that
the
line
would
be
shut
down
for
seven
months.
there
would
be
no
service.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
right
because
he
cannot
achieve
common
carrier
status
until
his
filed
rate
is
approved.
there
could
be
the
situation
of
repetitive
filings.
but,
in
a
suspension
proceeding,
there
is
not
be
no
prejudgment
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
rate.
thus,
you
would
have
no
road
map,
if
i
might
use
that
expression,
as
to
what
kind
of
rate
to
file.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
they
did
more,
respectfully,
your
honor.
they
went
well
beyond
that
and
they
set
the
rates.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
doing
so,
they
also
prejudge
the
very
investigation
that
they
had
ordered.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
but,
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
and
looking
at
the
order
that
they
did
issue
on
june
28,
we
suggest
that
it
is
an
absolute
prejudgment.
there
was
not
opportunity
for
us
to
realistically
make
the
kinds
of
defense
of
the
rate
that
we
were
entitled
to.
we
have
a
record
that
goes
down
to
an
administrative
law
judge
who
was
going
to
try
the
rate
proceedings.
in
that
record,
he
is
being
told
explicitly
by
his
appellate
authority,
if
you
will,
that
we
were
23%
higher
than
we
should
have
been
when
we
filed
that
rate.
i
suggest
respectfully
that
that
is
prejudgment
and
it
is
serious
prejudgment.
it
is
what
is
not
supposed
to
occur
in
rate-making
procedures
before
administrative
agencies.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
is
presumptively
reasonable,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
our
position,
that
it
is
a
naked
suspension
of
a
proposal.
that
proposal,
then,
is
subjected
to
adjudicative
investigation
and
a
determination
is
made
as
to
its
reasonableness
without
any
prejudgment.
at
the
mean
time,
everything
continues
as
it
was
before,
except
the
carrier
is
not
allowed
to
benefit
off
the
increasing
rates.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
suspension
was
unauthorized
and
unlawful
quite
apart
from
the
rate-making
aspects
simply
because
of
the
basis
of
the
construction
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
right,
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
right.
also,
the
fact
that
the
status
quo
was
found
to
be
not
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
your
honor,
it
does
and
it
includes
initial
even
in
15-7.
our
point
of
continuing,
if
you
will,
confusion
is
with
this
word
“initial.”
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
your
honor,
initial
rates
can
be
filed
in
any
number
of
circumstances.
for
example,
in
the
motor
carrier
act
back
in,
i
assume
it
was,
1935
when
they
were
bringing
thousands
of
motor
carriers
into
the
regulatory
regiment
they
were
filing
for
the
first
time
rates.
those
were
initial
rates.
we
can
have
mergers
of
various
parties
and
a
formation
of
a
new
rate
because
there
is
a
new
entity.
that
is
an
initial
filing.
we
can
have
what
were
formerly
joint
rates
put
together
as
a
single
composite
rate
and
re-file.
but,
none
of
these
equate
to
the
situation
before,
your
honors,
today
that
of
an
original
rate.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
pardon
me?
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
not
quite.
whether
you
call
it
original
or
not,
it
is
the
conceptual
stand-alone
identity
in
a
regulatory
sense
that
these
kinds
of
rates
have.
it
is
this
situation
regardless
of
label,
your
honor,
that
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
suspend
because
suspension
is
contrary
to
the
essence
of
the
statute
which
is
the
maintenance.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
your
honor,
the
motor
carrier
act
is
a
different
regulatory
system.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
assuming
that
it
is
the
same
as
15-7
and
it
is
a
startup
business,
new
route,
new
filing,
it
is
comparable
to
and
it
is
identical
with
the
situation
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
the
answer
is
no
suspension.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
as
to
a
motor
carrier.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
the
situation
in
the
motor
carrier
act,
as
we
find
in
water
carrier
and
some
of
the
other
acts,
is
this
certification
process.
here,
in
those
acts,
you
do
have
the
requirement
that
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
required.
the
rate
is
part
of
the
submission
or
can
be
followed
within
90
days.
the
filing
of
the
original
rate
can
be
filed
after
the
certificate
has
been
applied
for.
the
agency,
the
icc,
would
then
have
the
option
whether
in
fact
they
would
do
it
or
not
and
there
is
some
debate
in
the
briefs
whether
they
do
it
or
not,
but
would
have
the
option
of
withholding
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
is
not.
what
we
have
contended
is
that
although
there
may
be
question
as
to
whether
they
can
suspend
or
not,
in
a
motor
carrier
act,
the
certification
process
is
such
a
part
of
it
that
they
can
withhold
the
certificate
if
they
disapprove
the
rate.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
probably
not,
your
honor,
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
there,
the
situation
is
absolutely
clear,
your
honor.
under
the
federal
power
act
and
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
for
the
last
30
years,
the
federal
power
commission
has
held
by
regulation
that
they
do
not
have.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
is
the
same
statute,
your
honor,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
has
a
certification
situation
built
into
it.
the
courts
as
well
as
the
commission
have
consistently
recognized
that
since
this
is
going
to
be
a
contract
for
a
long
period
of
time
we
will
be
very
cautious
about
issuing
the
certificate
until
we
know
what
the
sale
price
of
the
rate
is
going
to
be.
there,
you
have
in
basic
relief
form
that
the
situation
as
contrasted
to
the
motor
carrier
act
and
what
we
are
looking
at
in
this
situation
on
oil
pipelines.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
they
are
regulatory
words
of
art,
your
honor,
and
i
tried
to
make
the
point
early.
you
do
not
see
this
language
in
the
act,
and
when
you
bring
it
in
to
describe
what
the
character
of
the
rate
is,
it
tends
to
be
misleading.
that
is
particularly
true
as
to
the
word
“initial”
because
initial
is
not
synonymous
with
original.
initial
can
be
a
schedule
file
that
contains
an
old
rate.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
could,
your
honor.
it
could
certainly.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
your
honor,
that
very
question
intrigued
the
commissioners
and
intrigued
all
three
of
the
justices
on
the
fifth
circuit
panel
that
we
argued
before.
our
position
then,
and
our
position
now,
is
suggesting
respectfully
that
the
question
does
not
make
commercial
sense.
but
assuming
that,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
our
position
would
be
that
the
icc
could
not
suspend
that
rate
even
though
it
was
at
an
outrageously
high
figure.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
impoundment
in
terms
of
a
refund
order.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
a
very
literal
sense
and
on
the
basis
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
answer
there
would
be
no
also.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
that
is
the
critical
element
in
all
of
this,
your
honor.
correctly
so
that
the
statutory
plan,
the
congressional
plan,
calls
for
reparations.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
because
what
has
intrigued
us
every
time
that
question
has
been
asked
is
the
other
side
of
the
question.
if
you
assume
suspension
power,
as
our
opponents
do,
could
the
commission
set
a
rate
for
the
transport
of
that
oil
at,
say,
$1?
the
answer
in
those
circumstances,
and
they
have
answered
that
question
affirmatively
before
the
fifth
circuit,
is
yes,
they
could.
where
does
the
balancing
come
in?
i
suggest
respectfully
that
the
balancing
comes
in
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
rate
established
in
the
first
instance
or
an
original
rate.
that
the
agency
does
not
have
authority
to
suspend
that
rate
and
to
the
extent
that
the
hearing
which
does
take
place
after
it
is
filed,
to
the
extent
that
the
hearing
finds
that
the
rate
was
excessive,
then
the
shipper
has
the
right
of
reparations.
if
on
the
other
hand
and
what
destroys
this
delicate
balance,
if
on
the
other
hand
the
agency
asserts
authority
and
suspends
and
then
finds
that
interestingly
the
rate
that
was
filed
was
a
correct
rate
within
the
zone
if
reason,
the
carrier
has
no
way
to
recover
the
moneys
lost
as
a
result
of
that
suspension
and
as
a
result
of
that
interim
rate
being
set
so
low.
that,
we
consider
to
be
the
balance.
the
attorney
general
has
made
what
is
essentially
an
equity
argument,
talking
about
the
need
for
money
now
in
the
state
of
alaska
and
not
wanting
to
wait
until
a
reparations
determination
has
been
made.
but,
the
situation
for
the
carriers,
your
honors,
is
that
if
we
were
right
and
we
believed
we
were
right
and
we
did
not
overreach
when
we
prepared
and
filed
those
original
tariffs
for
the
period
july
31st
through
october
20th,
when
the
stay
of
this
court
was
entered,
we
will
never
recover
that
money.
that
is
tens
upon
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
may
i
quickly
respond,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
pointing
out
that
although
not
neutral
in
that
sense,
the
carriers
when
they
sat
down
to
calculate
their
rate
had
a
formulation
that
existed
for
35
years
in
the
industry,
that
literally
thousands
upon
thousands
of
pipeline
rates
had
been
calculated
on
the
basis
of
and
that
this
agency
had
never
questioned
in
those
35
years.
it
had
never
questioned
that
formulation
and
it
is
a
formulation
that
was
exposed
to
this
court,
and
found
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
consent
decree
that
was
entered
in
1941.
we
were
not
completely
alone
and
unfettered
when
those
rates
were
calculated.
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
would
say
it
would
have
weight,
but
not
controlling
weight,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
say
further
that
what
this
court
should
look
at
for
purposes
of
this
question
of
statutory
construction
and
interpretation
is
what
the
commissioners
in
1910
sought
from
the
congress
and
what
they
said
to
the
congress
about
the
authority
that
they
sought.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
does
not
worry
us,
your
honor.
indeed,
we
view
that
as
a
complimentary
act
on
the
part
of
the
congress.
we
view
the
cummins
amendment
in
1920
as
using
language
believed
to
be
synonymous
with
the
“new
rate”
language
used
in
1910.
we
do
not
see
it
as
a
divergence
or
as
supportive
of
some
limitation
on
the
original
line.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
a
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
in
a
hearing,
we
would
have
that
burden.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
misspoke.
i
am
terribly
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
am
terribly
sorry.
in
a
hearing,
and
we
already
have
an
order
to
this
effect,
the
protesters
have
the
burden.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
the
carrier
in
the
hearing.
that
is
what
that
provision
speaks
to
in
that
last
provision.
it
was
entered
at
the
end
of
15-7.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
it
is
reflective,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
of
the
agency
practice
that
had
grown
up,
up
to
that
point,
where
the
concept
of
an
initial
rate
achieved
a
life
of
its
own.
but,
we
have
suggested
that
that
life
of
an
initial
rate
is
not
so
broad
as
to
encompass
this
rate
established
in
the
first
instance,
this
first
rate
for
a
new
entity,
this
original
rate
regardless
of
the
label.
the
label
has
been
confusing,
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
why
having
to
at
least
our
satisfaction
analyze
the
legislative
history
and
looked
at
those
old
and
new
icc
faces.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
do
not
believe
it
is
clear,
your
honor,
that
under
the
motor
carrier
act
an
original
rate
such
as
this
could
be
suspended.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
think
that
is
a
responsible
position,
but
there
is
something
even
more
important
in
the
motor
carrier
act
and
most
of
the
others.
indeed,
all
of
the
other
statute
cited
for
purposes
of
suggesting
this
pattern
of
congressional
activity
and
the
difference
is
that
they
are
all
licensing
statutes.
15-7
is
not
a
licensing
statute.
the
licensing
authority
can
withhold
the
license
if
the
original
rate
is
unacceptable.
it
does
not
have
to
get,
in
a
very
material
sense,
to
the
question
of
suspension.
it
simply
withholds
the
license.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
yes,
sir?
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
know
of
none,
your
honor,
and
we
suggested
just
that
alternative
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
commission
on
june
27th
that
it
could
have
been
done
on
an
expedited
basis.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
i
believe
it
came
into
the
act
later,
your
honor,
and
i
cannot
give
you
the
precise
date
but
the
pipelines
did
come
in,
i
think,
under
the
hepburn
act
in
1906
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
no,
they
did.
they
were
part
of
the
standard
oil
cartel
case
that
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1906
and
that
was
the
essence
of
that
litigation.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
j.
kilcarr
thank
you,
your
honor.
