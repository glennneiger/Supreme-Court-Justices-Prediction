but
the
4e
starts
out
when
any
such
new
schedule
is
found.
you
would
put
a
gloss
on
the
word
“new”
as
you
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
sentence?
at
the
expiration,
the
seventh-month
period
and
rate
goes
into
effect
but
there
is
a
power
in
the
commission
to
require
records
and
a
refund,
it
says
“but
in
case
of
a
proposed
increase
rate
or
charge
for,
in
respect
with
transportation
of
property,
the
commission
may
order
the
interested
carriers
to
keep
up.”
if
there
is
an
original
rate,
there
never
has
been
a
rate
but
the
rate
is
suspended,
as
you
say
the
commission
has
power
to
do,
and
seven
months
goes
by
and
the
rates
go
into
effect.
does
the
commission
have
the
power
under
this
language
to
require
a
record-keeping
and
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
take
it,
did
it
purport
to
exercise
this
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
this
was
a
condition,
an
ancillary
to
your
other
argument,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
this
language
remains
un-interpreted.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
we
disagreed
with
you
on
your
reading
of
prior
commission
cases
in
terms
of
how
it
has
construed
the
statute
down
through
the
years.
say,
form
1920
on,
we
just
disagreed
with
you
that
the
commission
has
always
asserted
and
read
the
statute
as
permitting
it
to
suspend
rates
whether
they
are
new,
initial,
or
original.
what
would
be
your
response
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
especially
worry
you
that
the
amendment
which
was
made
with
respect
to
changed
rates
and
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
15-7?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
got
the
burden
of
proving
the
reasonableness
of
an
original
rate,
as
you
call
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
got
the
burden
of
establishing
the
unreasonableness
of
a
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
got
the
burden
of
proving
the
reasonableness
of
a
changed
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
shows
some
awareness
by
the
congress
as
a
difference
between
a
changed
rate
and
an
initial
rate
because
the
burden
of
proof
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
see
any
statutory
difference
between
the
motor
carrier
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
for
15-7
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
the
motor
carrier
act
as
you
do
here?
