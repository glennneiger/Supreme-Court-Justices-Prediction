mr.
avrum
m.
gross
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
already
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
discussing
whether
or
not
section
15-7
which
applies
to
new
rates
only
really
applies
to
changed
rates.
i
had
intended
to
spend
my
time
primarily
on
the
interim
rate
question
and
the
refund
provision,
which
attended
the
icc’s
suspension
of
rates
in
this
case.
however,
before
leaving
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
i
would
like
to
make
one
very
simple
but
i
think
important
point.
section
15-7,
on
its
face,
is
clear.
the
language
says
that
you
may
suspend
a
new
rate.
i
think
under
any
common
interpretation
of
the
word
“new,”
this
is
a
new
rate.
the
discussion
in
this
court
has
focused
primarily
on
other
portions
of
the
statute
or
other
portions
of
other
statutes,
congress
enacting
an
amendment
in
1920,
congress
adapting
legislation
in
1940,
and
federal
power
commission
act.
in
my
capacity,
i
worked
with
the
state
legislature
a
good
deal.
it
is
asking,
i
think,
a
good
deal
for
a
legislature
to
be
internally
consistent
within
a
lengthy
act
all
by
itself.
it
is
asking
even
more
when
you
ask
that
subsequent
legislatures,
10
or
20
years
later,
approaching
the
question
from
different
points
of
view
and
in
different
statutes
to
be
equally
as
consistent.
you
can
probably
prove
a
lot
or
nothing
through
reference
to
subsequent
statutes.
if
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
on
its
face,
15-7
and
if
“new
rates,”
meaning
new
rates,
led
to
some
illogical
or
strange
result,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
interpretative
process
would
be
a
very
valuable
one.
but,
here,
the
statute
makes
eminent
sense
as
it
was
originally
written.
if
you
interpret
“new”
as
only
meaning
changed,
what
you
are
really
ending
up
with
is
a
statute
which
protects
the
public
for
a
substantial
amount
of
its
business
and
leaves
the
public
absolutely
defenseless
for
the
filing
of
initial
rates
or
new
rates
absolutely
defenseless.
certainly,
the
public
needs
the
suspension
power
in
the
icc,
as
this
case
so
clearly
demonstrates,
certainly
as
much
for
new
rates
as
it
does
for
changed
rates
and
the
carriers
are
in
no
worst
position
when
new
rates
are
suspended
than
when
changed
rates
are
suspended.
for
when
a
carrier
files
a
changed
rate,
by
definition,
it
is
asserting
that
the
rate
which
it
is
changing
is
unreasonable
and
is
leading
it
not
to
make
a
reasonable
profit.
so,
suspending
a
changed
rate
leaves
the
carriers
in
no
worst
position
than
they
claim
they
are
here
today.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
simply
taking
the
sentence
as
it
was
written
and
interpreting
it
in
its
normal
fashion
will
lead
to
an
extremely
sound
and
logical
result.
if
you
stretch
and
reach
for
an
unusual
result,
you
will
arrive
at
a
system
which
leaves
a
whole
area
of
regulation
open.
for
the
remainder
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
suspension
power.
i
am
going
to
assume
that
the
court
will
hold
that
there
is
a
suspension
power
over
newly
filed
rates
and
focus
on
whether
the
interim
rate
procedures
used
in
this
case,
and
the
refund
provision
adapted
it
as
a
condition
to
filing
interim
rates,
was
a
valid
exercise
of
the
icc’s
power.
the
question
simply
stated
is
whether
the
commission’s
actions
were
directly
related
to
its
power
to
assess
the
reasonableness
of
rates
filed
before
it
and
to
their
power
to
suspend
rates
pending
an
investigation.
to
analyze
that
relationship,
you
have
to
understand
a
little
bit
more
about
the
background
of
these
proceedings
because
if
you
do,
it
not
only
shows
the
soundness
of
the
statutory
interpretation
which
was
urged
earlier
by
easterbrook.
but
also,
that
both
of
the
procedures
used
by
the
icc
when
it
suspended
rates
and
suggested
a
level
of
interim
rates
which
would
accept
and
require
a
refund
provision
are
not
only
rationally
related
to
their
review
function
but
absolutely
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
that
power.
i
am
here,
of
course,
as
a
representative
of
the
people
of
alaska
who,
for
the
last
three
or
four
years,
have
undergone
what
we
at
alaska
laughingly
refer
to
as
pipeline
impact.
pipeline
impact,
roughly
defined,
is
inflation,
increased
crime,
housing
shortages,
and
crowded
classrooms.
these
are
caused
by
rapid
infusion
of
people
into
a
state
with
no
facilities
to
handle
them.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
something
like
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
very
close.
the
arctic
slope
native
corporation,
which
is
not
here
today
but
represented
in
part
by
myself,
had
it
even
worse.
they
suffered
not
only
the
things
i
spoke
about,
but
they
suffered
cultural
dislocation
on
the
eskimo
community
in
the
north
slope.
traditionally,
that
type
of
impact
is
met
by
socialite
action
of
one
sort
or
another.
to
do
that
in
alaska,
we
need
money.
the
money
comes
from
the
oil
and,
thereby,
lies
the
problem.
the
money
that
comes
to
the
state
of
alaska
from
the
production
of
oil
comes
from
its
royalty
and
its
severance
tax.
both
of
which
are
based
on
the
wellhead
value
of
the
oil.
the
wellhead
value
is
inversely
related
to
the
cost
to
transport
the
oil
to
market.
the
higher
the
tariff,
the
less
the
state
of
alaska
receives
specifically,
for
each
penny
that
the
tariff
is
too
high,
the
state
of
alaska
receives
$1
million
less
a
year.
$2
equals
$200
million
and
in
a
state
whose
budget
has
never
exceeded
$1
billion,
that
is
an
exceptionally
large
amount
of
money.
when
these
tariffs
were
filed,
in
our
view,
they
were
initially
too
high,
something
between
$2
and
$2.50
too
high.
we
alleged,
before
the
icc,
that
the
tariffs
were
outrageous
for
a
number
of
viewpoints.
first,
that
the
depreciation
was
improperly
calculated,
that
the
costs
of
building
the
pipeline
had
been
vastly
overblown,
the
taxes
had
not
been
treated
properly,
and
a
whole
host
of
things.
we
pointed
out
before
the
commission
that
we
believed,
and
our
calculations,
the
companies
would
receive
a
return
on
their
equity
of
something
approaching
46%.
the
oil
shippers
responded
to
us,
pipeline
companies,
by
saying
“there
is
no
real
problem.
wait
for
your
money.
there
is
a
situation.
you
can
get
reparations.”
if
this
commission
ultimately
decides
that
the
rates
are
too
high,
you
can
always
go
through
the
judicial
proceedings
required
to
obtain
reparations.
we
replied
before
the
commission
that
that
was
totally
unsatisfactory
for
two
reasons.
the
first
one
was
that
it
was
simply
our
money
and
not
theirs
and
we
had
a
right
to
receive
it.
but,
the
second
reason
was
the
most
important.
we
had
an
immediate
need
for
the
money.
we
had
suffered
impact
for
years.
we
had
children
who
were
crowded
in
classrooms.
we
had
serious
social
conditions
which
we
were
trying
to
alleviate.
we
needed
the
money
to
do
it.
as
the
counsel
for
the
north
slope
pointed
out
before
the
icc
so
eloquently,
it
was
small
solace
to
an
eskimo
child
to
be
told
that,
sometime
down
the
road,
there
would
be
money
for
a
school.
that
did
not
do
much
for
his
education.
we
felt
that
reparations
would
be
inadequate
and
a
risky
remedy.
legally,
it
is
extremely
risky.
traditionally,
in
reparations
cases,
of
course,
the
shippers
seek
the
reparations.
but
here,
as
the
court
has
undoubtedly
noticed,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
of
an
outrage
from
the
shippers
for
the
costs
of
shipping
this
oil
down
the
pipeline
which
is
not
terribly
surprising
since
the
people
who
own
the
oil
who
are
shipping
it
own
the
subsidiaries
who
operate
the
pipeline.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
because
the
price
of
oil
in
the
west
coast
market
is
primarily
set
by
competition
with
saudi
arabian
crude
and,
whatever
these
transportation
rates
are,
the
oil
cannot
go
above
that
price.
that
is
competitive
basis.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
new.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
but
they
are
extremely
minimal.
their
interests
are
minimal
and
i
suggest
that
the
take
on
the
major
oil
companies
over
an
issue
of
whether
the
tariffs
should
be
$1
higher
or
50
cents
higher
is
an
impractical
situation.
we
sought
the
suspension
rate
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
because
we
wanted
to
receive
our
royalty
and
our
severance
tax
now.
the
icc
reviewed
the
rates
and
it
balanced
a
whole
host
of
needs.
it
balanced
the
state’s
needs
for
its
money
now.
it
balanced
the
north
slope’s
need
for
its
money.
it
considered
the
availability
of
reparations,
the
likelihood
of
the
tariffs
being
eventually
approved,
and
if
so,
at
what
level.
the
fact
that
the
shippers
were
owners
of
the
pipeline
companies
themselves
and,
therefore,
the
damage,
if
any,
would
be
minimal
and
the
fact
that
a
suspension
would
only
be
in
effect
for
seven
months.
they
concluded,
after
all
that,
that
they
would
accept
the
company’s
factual
data
though
it
was
severely
challenged
by
the
petitioners.
that
it
would
refuse
to
accept
one
aspect
of
their
methodology,
in
essence,
the
law
of
the
case
and
would
approve
interim
rates
filed
at
a
level
which
use
the
appropriate
methodology
as
spelled
out
by
the
icc
and
the
company’s
numbers
saying
the
numbers
can
be
challenged
in
the
investigation.
in
essence,
it
was
very
much
like
a
summary
judgment
where
the
facts
were
accepted
and
the
icc,
in
essence,
said
“you
are
mistaken
as
to
the
methodology
you
should
use.
the
icc
accepted
interim
rates
which,
in
its
view,
would
have
resulted
in
a
more
than
satisfactory
return
on
equity
but
would
have
resulted
in
$1.37
less
per
barrel.
that
would
have
been
about
$70
million
for
the
state
of
alaska.
the
icc
could
have
played
what
i
can
only
consider
is
games.
it
could
have
turned
their
rates
down.
it
could
have
said
it
is
your
guess
how
to
get
to
the
right
number.
“you
try
and
figure
out
what
we
just
said.”
the
companies
could
have
come
in
with
a
new
number.
the
icc
could
have
thrown
that
one
out
and
they
could
have
gone
back
and
forth.
but,
the
icc
did
something
different.
it
said
“here
is
what
we
mean.
your
rates
do
not
qualify
because
you
are
using
the
wrong
methodology.
here
is
the
right
methodology
and
here
is
what
it
would
produce.”
anything
below
up
to
that
level
will
approve
providing
that
you
also
impose
a
refund
condition,
that
you
also
assure
us
that
if
we
allow
you
to
collect
this
tariff
during
the
seven-month
period,
which
is
based
on
numbers
which
are
severely
under
challenge
and
which
we
frankly
anticipate
that
the
final
tariff
will
be
substantially
lower,
that
you
require
or
you
setup
a
system
to
refund
the
excess
to
the
state
of
alaska
and
the
arctic
slope
which
needs
this
money
quickly.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
in
your
state,
i
am
sorry,
yes.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
sir.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
as
i
understand
it,
the
icc
state
order
requires
the
companies
to
keep
the
moneys
isolated
that
would
be
collected
between
their
interim
tariff
and
the
tariff
which
was
ultimately
approved.
what
you
did
is
you
stayed
the
icc’s
order
requiring
the
interim
tariff
or
setting
at
the
level
of
the
interim
tariff.
you
permitted
the
companies
to
collect
the
tariffs
that
they
had
originally
filed
and
required
that
they
keep
an
accounting
between
this
higher
tariff
and
the
interim
tariff.
that
money,
supposedly,
is
in
a
fund.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
i
am
sorry?
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
in
any
event,
if
you
rule
in
our
favor,
the
money
will
come
back
to
us
through
one
vehicle
or
another.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
something
like
that,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
within
the
time
frame
of
seven
months,
the
court
order
protects
it
as
well
as
the
icc
order,
beyond
the
seven
months,
it
is
only
the
icc
order.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
yes,
sir.
mr.
avrum
m.
gross
as
i
read
it
though,
your
order
was
somewhat
contingent
upon
the
validity
of
the
icc’s
suspension
order.
were
you
to
say
that
they
had
no
power
to
suspend,
i
would
assume
that
your
order
would
not
operate
in
our
favor.
i
only
wanted
to
say,
as
a
last
word,
that
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
if
this
refund
provision
were
not
in
the
order
of
the
icc
order,
i
think
it
is
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
icc
level
of
interim
rate
would
have
been
substantially
less
than
was
ultimately
adapted.
therefore,
the
two
are
intimately
related.
thank
you
very
much.
