mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
the
questions
of
statutory
construction
and
the
details
of
legislative
history
that
are
the
centerpiece
of
this
case,
i
want
to
address
two
themes
of
petitioners’
argument.
these
themes
run
through
and
appear
to
be
the
foundation
for
almost
all
of
petitioners’
particular
contentions.
the
first
theme
is
that
petitioners
have
been
treated
unfairly
by
the
commission
and
that
there
must
be
some
remedy
for
unfair
treatment.
the
second
theme
is
that
the
only
legitimate
use
of
the
suspension
power
is
to
preserve
the
status
quo.
the
suspension
here
did
not
preserve
the
status
quo,
petitioners
say,
and
so
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
it.
the
arguments
based
on
unfairness
fail,
we
believe,
at
the
outset
because
the
court
does
not
have
any
authority
to
review
suspension
orders.
that
was
the
holding
of
arrow
transportation
co.
and
the
holding
of
scrap
i.
congress
entrusted
to
the
commission
the
decision
whether
to
suspend.
the
only
question
that
may
be
raised
here
is
not
whether
the
suspension
was
fair
or
not,
but
whether
there
was
statutory
authority
to
suspend
original
or
initial
rates.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
both
involved
decisions
not
to
suspend.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
did.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
indicated
in
arrow
at
page
570
of
volume
372
that
similar
principles
would
apply
in
the
case
of
a
decision
to
suspend.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
neither
involved
a
suspension
and
the
direct
holdings
of
them
do
not
support
it.
i
would,
however,
point
to
a
case
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
court
of
new
york
authority
that
451fed2-783
which
says
that
that
principle
logically
follows
from
arrow.
that
decision
was,
by
the
way,
cited
by
the
court
with
approval
in
scrap
i.
but,
i
need
not
maintain
the
broad
position
about
un-reviewability
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
difficulty
with
petitioners’
arguments.
the
suspension
here
is
no
more
unfair
to
petitioners
than
the
suspension
of
an
increase
in
rates.
in
either
case,
the
carriers
lose
the
difference
between
what
they
want
to
charge
and
what
the
commission
by
exercising
the
suspension
power
allows
them
to
charge.
that
difference
in
this
case
was
approximately
20%
of
the
rates
that
the
carriers
wanted
to
charge.
many
times
established
carriers
seek
to
increase
their
rates
by
20%
and
that
increase
is
suspended.
the
difference
between
what
the
carriers
want
and
what
the
carriers
are
allowed
to
receive
is
the
same
whether
we
are
talking
about
initial
rates
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
increased
rates.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
not
at
all.
i
am
simply
responding
to
the
argument
that
because
it
is
unfair,
the
commission
must
not
have
the
power
which
is
something
of
a
different
argument.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
could
not
say
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
at
least
in
the
case
where
that
type
of
thing
might
otherwise
occur.
but,
i
think
i
can
go
a
little
further
than
that
too.
suspension
proceedings
in
their
nature
involve
a
balance
of
considerations.
somebody
loses
in
a
suspension
case
no
matter
what
happens.
the
shippers
and
the
public
may
lose,
perhaps
irreparably,
if
rates
are
too
high
and
are
allowed
to
go
into
effect.
congress’
perception
that
shippers
and
the
public
would
often
lose
was
the
reason
why
it
gave
the
commission
the
suspension
power.
on
the
other
hand,
the
carriers
may
lose
if
rates
are
unnecessarily
or
improvidently
suspended.
nothing
can
avoid
the
fact
that
someone
is
hurt,
whether
rates
are
suspended
or
not.
the
attorney
general
of
alaska
will
discuss
at
greater
lengths
how
high
rates
hurt
alaska
and
why
the
suspension
power
for
initial
rates
is
necessary.
but,
my
point
is
that
petitioners’
contention
that
they
were
aggrieved
by
the
suspension
is
just
one-half
of
the
balance.
it
is,
therefore,
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
study
it
in
great
detail.
finally,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
commission
acted
unfairly
here.
the
commission
accepted
all
of
the
carrier’s
data
about
the
costs
that
they
invested
in
building
the
pipeline
even
though
those
data
are
subject
to
very
short
dispute.
it
accepted
the
carrier’s
contention
that
the
appropriate
period
of
depreciation
is
25
years
even
though
35
years
is
the
commission’s
ordinary
period
for
computing
depreciation
of
oil
pipelines.
the
commission
accepted
the
carrier’s
disputed
contentions
about
income
tax
considerations.
it
afforded
the
carriers
a
10%
return
on
valuation
even
though
the
commission’s
standard
practice
with
respect
to
pipelines
is
8%.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
agree
entirely.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
point
is
that
the
carriers
are
claiming
that
they
have
been
treated
unfairly
and
that
there
must
be
a
remedy
for
that.
my
observation
is
that
that
is
far
from
obvious.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
other
half
of
my
opening
observation
is
that
petitioners’
argument
that
the
suspension
power
exists
only
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
status
quo,
confuses
ends
with
means.
the
suspension
of
rates,
the
temporary
freezing
of
the
status
quo,
is
a
means
to
an
end,
not
a
purpose
in
itself.
it
would
be
pointless
to
preserve
the
status
quo
just
for
the
purpose
of
preservation.
the
reason
why
congress
gave
the
commission,
the
power
to
suspend
rates
is
because
it
may
appear
that
the
rates
that
have
been
proposed
are
too
high
and
that
some
persons
may
be
harmed
by
rates
that
are
too
high.
shippers
and
the
public
need
protection,
at
least
for
the
short-term
before
full
rate-making
proceedings
can
occur
while
the
commission
conducts
a
more
thorough
investigation.
a
suspension
of
rates
offers
the
public
that
protection.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
argument
here
is
that
preservation
of
a
status
quo
is
not
an
end,
but
a
means.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no
oil.
the
status
quo
would
be
exactly
what
it
was
before.
no
one
was
shipping
any
oil
through
the
pipeline
before
and
no
one
is
shipping
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
delays
it
for
seven
months.
everything
is
left
exactly
the
way
it
was
before.
but,
the
reason
why
the
commission
suspends
rates
is
not
because
it
does
not
want
to
see
oil
flowing
through
the
pipeline.
it
is
not
because
it
does
not
believe
that
a
particular
transportation
service
should
be
offered.
it
is
because
it
believes
that
the
rates
that
have
been
proposed
for
those
transportation
services
appear
to
be
too
high.
if
we
keep
in
mind
that
distinction
between
ends
and
means,
the
end
being
a
protection
of
the
public
during
an
interim
period
from
rates
that
appear
to
be
too
high,
and
the
means
being
the
suspension.
petitioners’
argument,
we
believe,
falls
apart.
preservation
of
the
status
quo
loses
the
status
as
a
shibboleth
that
petitioners
would
give
it.
the
process
really
is
dynamic
and
it
works
like
this;
the
carriers
propose
a
rate
and
if
the
commission
believes
in
the
short
time
available
to
it
that
the
rate
appears
to
be
too
high,
it
suspends
the
rate.
the
suspension
freezes
the
status
quo
but
only
for
a
while.
the
suspension
does
not
believe
that
the
commission
thinks
the
old
rate
or,
in
this
case,
no
rate
is
the
best
rate.
the
suspension
means
only
that
the
proposed
rate
seems
to
be
too
high.
the
carriers
then
can
return
to
the
commission,
as
section
6
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
allows,
with
another
rate
proposal.
if
the
second
rate
proposal
also
appears
to
be
too
high,
the
commission
will
suspend
the
second
rate
proposal.
if
it
does
not
appear
to
be
too
high,
it
will
allow
it
to
go
into
effect.
the
process
can
be
repeated
until
the
carriers
hit
upon
a
rate
proposal
that
the
commission
does
not
think
appears
to
be
too
high.
the
commission
allows
that
to
go
into
effect.
meanwhile,
the
investigation
of
rates
triggered
by
the
initial
suspension
is
proceeding
and
that
the
conclusion
of
the
investigation,
the
commission
will
set
a
rate
under
section
15-1
after
the
full
hearings
that
are
possible,
only
given
adequate
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
many
cases,
the
time
span
is
a
year
or
less.
in
this
case,
the
time
span,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
good
deal
longer.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
often
exceeds
seven
months.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
the
mann-elkins
act
in
1910,
by
the
way,
authorized
the
suspension
to
run
for
longer
than
seven
months,
authorized
it
to
run
for
10
months.
the
length
of
its
suspension
represents
more
of
political
compromise
and
a
balance
of
the
interest
than
any
measure
of
how
long
the
commission’s
investigation
takes.
the
suspension
process
then
is
one
that
moderates
carrier’s
rate
proposals
in
order
to
give
effect.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
can
put
the
original
rate
into
effect
and
the
commission
can
do
nothing
about
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission
does
not
claim
the
authority
to
have
successive
seven-month
suspensions,
certainly
not
37
of
them.
the
process
by
which
proposals
are
moderated
to
take
into
account
the
observation
that
rates
appear
to
be
too
high
explains
why,
in
the
chessie
case,
the
court
approved
the
decision
of
the
commission
to
suspend
particular
rates
at
the
same
time
as
it
announced
to
the
railroads
that
if
they
proposed
other
rates
with
a
particular
condition,
it
would
not
suspend
them.
in
chessie,
the
commission
used
its
suspension
power
to
alter
the
status
quo
in
an
important
way
and,
to
do
so
permanently.
this
court
approved
it
because
what
the
commission
had
done
ultimately
reflected
only
its
judgment
about
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
if
the
court
agrees
with
that
point,
the
rest
of
my
argument
follows,
i
believe,
almost
inexorably.
petitioners
say
that
the
commission
cannot
suspend
initial
or
original
rates
because
initial
rates
for
new
services
are
not
new
rates
within
the
meaning
of
section
15-7.
but,
the
reasons
for
having
a
suspension
power
for
original
rates
apply
in
the
same
way
to
those
rates
as
they
apply
to
changed
rates.
either
an
initial
rate
or
a
changed
rate
may
appear
to
be
too
high.
the
suspension
in
either
case
allows
the
agency
additional
time
to
study
things
before
the
rate
takes
effect,
thus
protecting
the
public.
the
carriers
always
can
propose
other
lower
rates
until
the
commission
decides
not
to
suspend.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
many
cases,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
proposal
to
change
a
rate
is
simply
a
proposal
to
change
a
carrier-made
rate.
that
is,
a
carrier
may
propose
a
rate
and
it
is
not
suspended
or
set
aside.
two
years
later,
the
carrier
proposes
to
increase
the
rate.
there
is
no
greater
or
less
presumption
of
reasonableness
attached
to
that
rate
which
has
been,
in
effect,
two
years
only
because
the
carriers
made
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
shippers
or
members
of
the
public
had
protested,
the
chances
of
an
unreasonable
rate
being
set
aside
or
investigated
are
considerably
greater
than
if
no
one
protests.
but
in
other
even,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
point
is
that
it
was
a
carrier-made
rate
to
begin
with
and
entitled
to
whatever
presumption
of
reasonableness
the
carrier’s
own
rate
proposals
take
with
them.
but,
if
fine
gradations
can
be
made
in
line
of
presumptions
of
reasonableness,
a
responsive
argument
might
be
that
rates
that
have
never
been
in
effect
are
not
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
and
that
is
all
the
more
reason
for
the
commission
to
suspend
them
while
it
studies
them.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
find
it
troublesome.
in
fact,
we
could
not
figure
out
what
proposition
they
were
sighting
it
for.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
brennan,
that
was
the
same
proposition
that
this
court
made
in
the
catco
case,
atlantic
refining
against
the
public
service
commission.
it
depends
entirely
on
peculiarities
and
the
statutory
language
concerning
the
power
act.
the
power
act
provides
and
the
portion
of
it
was
discussed
in
catco
and
in
that
case,
provides
that
regulated
companies
must
file
schedules
“plainly
stating
the
change
or
changes
to
be
made
in
schedules
then
enforced.”
it
then
gives
the
power
commission,
now
the
energy
regulatory
commission,
the
authority
to
suspend
“such
new
schedules.”
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
very
different
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
the
context
of
the
power
act,
the
reference
is
to
change
or
changes
in
schedules
then
enforced.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
would
not
put
a
gloss
on
the
word
“new,”
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
emphasize
the
word
“such”
because
the
“such”
refers
back
to
the
things
foregoing.
i
might
point
out,
by
the
way,
that
the
statement
in
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
mr.
justice
brennan
read
and
the
statement
in
catco
simply
reflected
what
the
power
commission’s
practice
had
been.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has
not
decided
whether
it
agrees
with
the
power
commission’s
interpretation
of
that
authority.
i
do
not
want
it
in
any
way
to
foreclose
the
reconsideration
of
it.
but,
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
statutes
are
very
different
statutes.
there
are,
however,
some
statutes
that
look
exactly
like
section
15-7.
those
statutes
are
in
the
motor
carrier
and
water
acts
and
in
the
federal
communications
act.
those
statutes
that
look
exactly
like
15-7
talk
about
the
suspension
of
new
rates.
but,
they
unmistakably
give
the
commerce
commission
and
the
communications
commission
the
authority
to
suspend
original
rates
even
though
they
use
exactly
the
language
of
15-7.
those
statutes
are
discussed
at
pages
28.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
original
rights
and
initial
rights.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
difference
appears
nowhere
in
the
statute,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
only
word
that
appears
in
the
statute
is
“new
rates.”
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
argued
that
any
rate
that
does
not
represent
a
rate
already
in
effect
is
a
new
rate.
it
can
be
new
because
it
is
an
increase.
it
can
be
new
because
it
has
never
been
used
before.
the
word
“new”
stands
in
that
statute
in
opposition
to
“old.”
these
rates
are
as
new
as
new
can
be.
it
is
very
hard
to
find
any
rates
newer
than
these.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
or,
the
fact
that
there
simply
was
no
old
rate,
that
these
rates,
whatever
else
they
might
be,
are
not
old
rates.
if
they
are
not
old
rates,
then
they
are
new.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
i
can
refer
to
the
popular
usage
of
that.
when
someone
introduces
a
new
product,
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
replacing
some
old
product.
it
may
be
quite
new.
it
has
never
been
used
before.
colored
television
was
new
not
because
it
replaced
something
old,
but
because
it
was
new.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
let
me
try
black-and-white
television.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
also
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
can
refer
to
an
analogy
under
the
federal
power
commission
practice,
one
of
which
this
court
is
familiar
in.
it
is
the
definition
of
new
gas.
federal
power
commission
treats
as
new
gas,
gas
that
flows
from
wells
that
have
just
been
dug.
in
fact,
it
has
two
categories
of
new
gas.
one
is
gas
from
new
flowing
wells
and
another
is
increased
flows
over
flows
in
existing
wells.
they
are
both
new
gas.
that
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
is
happening
here.
the
increase
in
an
existing
rate
and
a
brand
new
rate
are
both
thought
of
as
new
rates.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission
must
find
that
the
new
rate
appears
to
be
unreasonable
and
it
is
required
by
the
statute
to
state
reasons
for
its
decisions.
that
implies
at
least
that
the
commission
has
to
make
a
finding.
there
is
no
explicit
allocation
in
the
statute
of
a
burden
of
proof.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission
understands
that
to
state
the
circumstances
under
which
it
can,
as
a
matter
of
a
straight
order,
require
refunds.
that
sentence
entered
the
act
in
1920
in
the
transportation
act.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
last
sentence
of
section
15-7.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
now,
i
am
afraid,
have
lost
the
thread
of
your
question.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
far
as
the
suspension
power
is
concerned,
the
commission’s
position
is
that
that
sentence
does
not
provide
that
a
changed
rate
receives
different
suspension
treatment
than
an
original
or
an
initial
rate.
that
is
so
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
that
same
sentence
appears
in
the
motor
carrier
act,
section
3-16,
in
which
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
suspend
initial
rates.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but,
it
adapted
the
language
of
section
15-7
because
congress
thought
that
that
is
what
that
language
meant.
to
that
extent,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
congress
has
spoken
authoritatively
on
the
meaning
of
that
language
and
has
adapted
it
and
used
it
for
a
particular
purpose
indicating
what
it
thinks
that
purpose
is.
my
second
answer
is
that
the
commission’s
view
is
that
change,
for
the
purpose
of
that
sentence,
refers
not
only
to
a
change
from
a
rate
to
a
higher
rate,
but
a
change
from
no
rate
to
some
rate.
it
is
sufficiently
broad.
it
is
necessary
to
read
it
that
way
in
order
to
make
sense
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
it
does.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
still
believe
that
that
sentence
came
in
1920
and
it
is
the
basis
for
petitioners’
claim
of
authoritative
gloss,
that
congress
has
placed
an
authoritative
gloss
on
the
word
“new”
by
placing
that
sentence
in
the
statute.
my
response
as
to
why
the
language
is
different
is
that
congress,
in
1920,
simply
does
not
appear
to
have
thought
about
the
differences
in
the
language
but,
that
it
does
not
appear
to
have
used
them
in
different
ways
in
light
of
the
way
it
treated
that
same
language
in
the
motor
carrier
act.
the
language
came
in
without
legislative
history.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission
has
not
interpreted
that,
although
it
entered
a
record-keeping
provision
here
and
the
carriers
did
not
contest
to
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
did
not
purport
to
exercise
that
refund
power
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
did
set
a
condition.
it
did
not
purport
to
exercise
that
power
to
set
the
refund
condition.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
commission’s
full
attention
has
not
yet
been
devoted
to
that
language.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
position,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
we
need
not
devote
full
attention
to
it
here
because
the
commission’s
order
can
be
sustained
quite
fully
on
the
grounds
that
it
gave.
my
submission
so
far
has
dealt
with
the
problem
of
the
suspension
of
initial
rates.
if
the
commission
can
suspend
rates,
and
we
think
it
follows
that
it
can
announce
some
lower
rate
that
it
will
not
suspend.
the
purpose
of
suspension,
as
i
have
said,
is
to
prevent
the
charging
of
a
price
that
appears
to
be
too
high.
it
is
not
at
all
to
stop
the
carriers
from
offering
a
service.
in
order
to
determine
what
is
too
high,
the
commission
must
have
at
least
a
tentative
view
of
how
to
distinguish
excessive
rates
from
permissible
rates.
in
stating
reasons
for
suspension,
the
commission
may
decide
and
announce
how
it
made
that
decision,
how
it
established
a
tentative
line.
it
revealed
here
that
the
rates
appeared
to
be
too
high
because
the
carriers
had
used
an
improper
method
of
computing
the
rate
of
return
on
investment.
if
it
had
stopped
there,
petitioners
could
have
figured
out
for
themselves
what
rates
they
could
have
charged
that
will
be
low
enough
that
the
commission
would
not
suspend
them.
the
commission
performed
that
chore
of
the
carriers.
petitioners
seem
to
think
that
the
commission
did
too
good
a
job
of
thinking
through
why
their
rates
appeared
to
be
too
high
and
announcing
its
reasons.
but,
it
will
be
bizarre
if
the
commission
could
proceed
within
the
law
only
by
concealing
the
reasons
for
its
decisions.
its
statement
of
reasons
should
not
expose
it
to
a
charge
of
illegal
conduct.
petitioners
say,
though,
that
this
is
rate-making
without
the
formal
hearings
required
for
rate-making.
if
the
commission
is
having
a
good
reason
for
believing
that
particular
rates
are
too
high
is
rate-making,
then
i
suppose
this
case
is
rate-making.
but,
that
does
not
carry
petitioners
very
far.
it
is
more
a
play
on
words
than
an
argument.
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
suspend
rates
and
required
it
to
have
reasons
for
doing
so.
the
commission
complied
fully
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
having
reasons.
petitioners’
attempt
to
hang
a
phrase
on
that
decision
does
not
do
anything
to
impeach
it.
but
we
do
not,
however,
agree
that
this
is
rate-making
as
that
word
is
understood
within
the
meaning
of
section
15-1.
the
commission
has
opened
a
full
investigation
in
the
petitioners’
rates.
the
rates
will
be
made
after
full
hearings
that
are
now
in
progress
before
ferc.
they
will
then
be
subject
to
full
judicial
review.
this
case
concerns
only
the
rates
that
were
to
be
charged
during
the
first
seven
months,
months
now
gone
by.
congress
clearly
created,
in
the
suspension
power,
a
special
control
that
could
be
exercised
during
those
seven
months
without
regard
to
the
more
formal
proceedings
with
section
15-1
that
congress
knew
consumed
more
than
seven
months
to
carry
out.
the
entire
reason
for
having
a
suspension
power
is
that
rate-making
cannot
be
completed
in
seven
months
and
certainly
cannot
be
completed
before
rates
go
into
effect
in
the
first
instance.
petitioners’
argument,
that
their
rates
during
the
first
seven
months
were
influenced
by
the
suspension
power
and
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
announced
what
made
it
think
that
the
rates
were
too
high,
is
nothing
but
a
resurrection
of
their
result
of
the
suspension
power
itself.
if,
as
we
argue,
the
commission
can
suspend
initial
rates
all
together,
it
can
relax
that
suspension
by
stating
reasons
and
allow
lower
rates
during
the
first
seven
months.
the
final
argument
here
concerns
the
refund
condition.
this
condition,
we
think,
should
be
sustained
for
the
same
reason
that
the
court
upheld
the
commission’s
decision
in
chessie.
the
condition
is
intimately
related
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
during
the
seven-month
period.
the
commission
was
willing
to
take
the
carrier’s
assertions
about
investment
depreciation
and
the
like
at
face
value,
only
if
it
could
be
sure
that
any
error
in
the
carrier’s
favor
allowing
the
collection
of
excessive
rates
would
eventually
be
corrected.
the
commission
was
concerned
about
the
level
of
the
rates
and
if
a
refund
condition
were
unavailable,
the
commission
might
well
have
been
unwilling
to
approve
rates
even
as
high
as
those
that
are
allowed
to
go
into
effect
without
suspension.
this
court
has
held
that
the
federal
power
commission,
which
lacks
a
general
power
to
order
refunds,
may
condition
the
grant
of
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
on
the
carrier’s
willingness
to
make
refunds.
the
case
in
which
it
did
that
is
united
gas
improvement
company
against
callery
properties,
382us.
the
court
said,
indeed,
that
a
refund
condition
was
essential
to
protect
the
public
and
that
it
could
be
made
a
condition
even
though
congress
had
been
unwilling
to
provide
the
commission
affirmatively
with
that
power
.this
court,
itself,
imposed
a
refund
condition
when
it
allowed
petitioners
to
collect
the
rates
that
the
commission
had
suspended.
the
principle
is
really
the
same
here.
the
commission
could
have
suspended
outright
and
it
can
protect
the
public
by
conditioning
non-suspension
on
the
carrier’s
agreement
to
refund
rates
later
determined
to
be
excessive.
in
sum,
the
commission
has
used
its
suspension
power
for
the
purpose
it
was
created
to
serve,
to
protect
the
public
from
rates
that
appear
to
be
excessive
and
to
do
so
during
the
seven
months
before
a
more
thorough
study
can
be
completed.
this
purpose
applies
to
the
suspension
of
original
rates
in
just
the
same
way
as
it
applies
to
the
suspension
of
any
other
rate.
this
purpose
explains
why
the
commission
can
allow
lower
rates
to
go
into
effect,
once
rates
that
have
not
been
too
high
have
been
proposed.
it
demonstrates
why
the
commission
legitimately
may
request
the
carriers
to
agree
to
refund
rates
determined
to
be
excessive.
the
same
purpose
underlying
the
suspension
power
explains
everything
the
commission
did
here.
its
decision
is,
therefore,
correct.
