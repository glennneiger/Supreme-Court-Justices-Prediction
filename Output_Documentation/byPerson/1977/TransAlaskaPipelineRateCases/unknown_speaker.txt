counsel,
there
was
no
protest
filed
by
any
independent
producer?
unknown
speaker
have
any
indicated
dissatisfaction
with
the
situation?
do
you
know
why
there
was
no
protest
found?
unknown
speaker
at
this
point,
can
i
ask?
how
far
in
advance
of
the
startup
time
were
these
tariffs
filed?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
possible
for
your
tariffs
to
have
been
filed,
say,
seven
months
ahead
of
its
startup
time?
unknown
speaker
the
court
says
15-7
mentions
new
rates,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
your
point
is
that
in
that
very
language,
the
phrase
“new
rates”
implies
the
existence
of
old
rates?
unknown
speaker
if
“new”
initially
included
an
issue,
then
you
are
suggesting
that
the
section
which
my
brother
rehnquist
referred
qualified
or
modified
or
narrows
the
word
“new.”
unknown
speaker
actually,
an
initial
rate
can
be
a
new
rate,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
word
“new”
can
include
original
rates?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know.
it
does
not
have
to
be
if
you
look
at
the
rest
of
the
section.
unknown
speaker
the
rate
for
a
new
service
could
never
be
a
new
rate.
unknown
speaker
the
commission
here
gave
you
one.
unknown
speaker
they
set
a
rate
at
which
you
could
file,
it
would
not
be
suspended.
unknown
speaker
they
gave
you
a
roadmap.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kilcarr,
on
the
question
of
whether
new
includes
initial,
do
you
agree
that
in
the
motor
carrier
act
it
does?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
it
is
contrasted
to
original?
unknown
speaker
would
you
explain
that?
unknown
speaker
at
least,
for
my
benefit.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
question
in
a
different
form
then.
do
you
contend
that
if
there
were
a
new
motor
carrier
went
into
business,
it
never
been
in
business
before,
and
it
filed
a
tariff,
would
the
commission
suspend
that
tariff?
unknown
speaker
but
it
uses
the
same
language
as
this.
unknown
speaker
then,
is
the
answer
no?
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
they
could
not
suspend
as
to
a
motor
carrier.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
whether
they
would
have
the
power
to
grant
the
certificate
and
say,
“we
will
do
these
things
one
step
at
a
time.
we
will
grant
the
certificate.
we
will
suspend
your
rate.”
could
they
do
that?
you
would
say
no,
i
guess.
do
you
say
no?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
yes,
they
can
do
that.
but,
that
is
just
turning
the
question
around.
do
they
have
statutory
power
to
grant
the
certificate
and
then
suspend
the
rate
and
say
“we
will
let
you
know,
we
were
going
to
give
you
the
certificate
but
we
just
do
not
think
you
are
rated”?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
federal
power
commission,
if
there
is
a
new
pipeline
starting
up
and
they
filed
rates.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
the
construction
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
and
it
admits
it
is
the
same
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
flynn,
going
back
to
chessie
for
a
minute,
congress
did
not
give
the
commission
power
to
require
the
railroad
to
spend
money
on
deferred
maintenance,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
it
is
different
between
an
expressed
prohibition
and
an
absence
of
power.
unknown
speaker
you
are
assuming,
for
the
purpose
of
your
argument,
the
power
to
suspend.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
assuming
that.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
your
brother,
he
said
while
the
court
may
not
have
authority
to
review
suspension
orders,
it
may
rather
order
an
order
declining
to
suspend.
it
may
have
authority
to
review
suspension
orders.
did
scrap
and
arrow
both
involve
suspension
orders?
unknown
speaker
not
to
suspend,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
when
did
they
then
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
review
a
suspension
order?
they
do
not,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
but
neither
those
cases
involved
a
suspension
order.
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
an
equity
case
where
we
are
evaluating
whether
or
not
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
was
fair
or
unfair.
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
what
has
fairness
go
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
understand
that
to
be
their
argument.
unknown
speaker
it
often
exceeds
seven
months.
unknown
speaker
typically,
it
does,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
the
question
of
whether
new
includes
initial
or
original,
those
petitioners
rely
on
summary
364
and
you
do
not
mention
it
in
your
brief.
you
do
not
find
it
troublesome?
unknown
speaker
they
quote
from
it.
when
they
produce
or
commence
an
interstate
sale
for
a
particular
field,
there
are,
by
definition,
no
existing
rates.
accordingly,
the
suspension
provisions
which
are
bottomed
on
delaying
the
effectiveness
of
and
suspending
changes
are
not
relevant.
unknown
speaker
so
your
amswer
is
that
