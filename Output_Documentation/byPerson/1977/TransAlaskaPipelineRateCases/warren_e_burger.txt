chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
mobil
alaska
pipeline
company
against
the
united
states
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
kilcarr,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
your
whole
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
they
prejudge
it
when
they
left
the
matter
open
with
the
impoundments
procedure?
it
might
go
up
or
down
after
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
flynn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
another
form
of
the
argument
your
colleague
made
about
new
or
original?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
easterbrook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
time
span
involved
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
my
brother
rehnquist
means
is
the
next
to
the
last
sentence
“at
any
hearing
involving
a
change
in
a
rate,
fare,
charge,
or
classification
the
burden
of
proof
shall
be
upon
the
carrier.”
is
that
not
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
is
the
next
sentence
that
penultimate
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
not
ask
if
the
attorney
general
of
alaska
to
fragment
his
argument.
we
will
resume
at
1
o'clock.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
something
like
an
occupying
army?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
a
bit
like
a
dependent
relative
revocation.
if
one
does
not
hold,
the
other
one
takes
over.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
kilcarr,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
first,
perhaps
it
has
already
been
covered.
suppose
instead
of
the
rate
that
was
asked
for,
you
would
ask
four
times
that
rate,
would
you
think
there
would
be
no
remedy?
what
would
you
think
the
icc
power
would
have
been?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
impose
an
impoundment
requirement
or
does
that
stand
flow
with
the
suspension?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
be
any
remedy
absent
to
suspension?
would
there
be
any
other
remedy
that
they
could
deal
with
a
rate
which
you
concede,
for
these
purposes,
four
times
too
high?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
putting
aside
the
question
of
the
equities,
whether
they
are
relevant
or
not,
there
is
a
certain
lack
of
parallel.
in
the
one
case,
the
icc
is
presumably
neutral,
whereas,
in
the
first
instance
those
fixing
the
rates
are
not
neutral
by
definition
and
not
neutral
on
the
subject.
i
do
not
mean
that
in
any
pejorative
sense.
they
are
interested
in
the
economics
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
interstate
pipelines.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
two
opinions
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan;
one
what
is
called
trans
alaska
pipeline
rates
cases
and
the
other,
monell
against
the
department
of
social
services
of
new
york.
