justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
case
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
the
facts
are
very
complicated
than
few
are
interested
in
them,
except
the
litigants
and
tax
council,
and
little
purpose
would
be
served
in
reviewing
them
here
in
much
detail.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
case
arose
when
the
worthen
bank
in
little
rock,
arkansas,
desired
to
build
a
new
banking
facility
in
attendant
parking
ramp
and
because
it
was
rather
low
end
capital,
it
failed
to
receive
the
permission
of
the
state
and
federal
regulators
to
--
itself
to
borrow
money
of
the
kind
needed
for
the
accomplishment
of
its
purpose
and
so
what
happened
after
extensive
of
negotiations
was
that
the
bank
entered
into
a
sale
and
leaseback
arrangement
with
the
petitioner
frank
lyon
&
company
whereby
lyon
took
title
to
the
building
and
he
then
leased
it
back
to
the
bank
for
a
long-term
use.
lyon
then
obtained
both
the
construction
loan
and
permanent
mortgage
financing.
in
the
year
when
the
building
was
completed
then
the
bank
took
possession,
the
lyon
claimed
as
deductions,
depreciation
of
the
building
and
interest
on
the
construction
loan
and
the
mortgage
and
other
expenses.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
these
deductions
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioner
was
not
the
owner
of
the
building
for
tax
purposes
and
that
the
sale
and
leaseback
arrangement
was
a
financing
transaction
in
which
lyon
merely
loaned
the
bank
a
sum
of
money
and
acted
as
conduit
for
the
transmission
of
principal
and
interest
to
the
mortgagee.
in
this
refund
suit,
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
ruled
in
favor
of
lyon,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
in
turn
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
claimed
deductions.
we
rule
that
the
transaction
was
not
a
sham
by
which
the
petitioner
was
only
a
conduit,
instead
this
was
a
genuine
multiple
party
transaction
with
economic
substance
and
substance
that
was
compelled
or
encouraged
by
business
or
regulatory
realities
and
it
therefore
was
imbued
with
tax
independent
considerations
and
the
government
we
feel
should
honor
the
allocations
of
rights
and
duties
effectuated
by
the
parties.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
