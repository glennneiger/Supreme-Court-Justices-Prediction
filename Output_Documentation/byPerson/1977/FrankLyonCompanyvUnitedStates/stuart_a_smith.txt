mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
this
transaction
resulted
in
frank
lyon
having
an
investment
in
this
bank
building
that
would
support
its
claim,
income
tax
deductions,
the
depreciation
and
mortgage
interest.
as
the
arguments
have
thus
far
illuminated
this
particular
species
of
transaction
the
sale
and
leaseback
is
no
stranger
to
this
court,
to
the
lower
federal
courts
or
to
the
tax
bar.
for
more
than
40
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
lazarus
that
the
statutory
tax
deductions
attributable
to
the
ownership
of
property
do
not
follow
legal
title
but
turn
on
capital
investment.
so
the
question
really
is
who
made
the
requisite
capital
investment
in
this
bank
building
to
justify
depreciation
and
who
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
say
it
is
worthen.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
who
enjoyed
the
use
of
borrowed
funds
to
justify
the
deduction
for
mortgage
interest.
we
submit
that
an
analysis
of
the
transaction
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
settled
principles
in
this
area
so
that
worthen
bank
had
the
investment
in
the
building
because
frank
lyon
when
the
transaction
was
properly
analyzed
did
nothing
more
than
lend
worthen
bank
$500,000
to
earn
6%
interest.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
think
the
lazarus
case
established
as
the
basic
principles
in
the
area,
that
the
statutory
right
to
deductions
for
the
ownership
of
property
do
not
follow
the
title
but
rather
follow
capital
investment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
the
part
of
the
opinion
you
have
cited
was
authority
to
the
court
adopting
the
federal
tax,
well,
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
the
court’s
decision
because
essentially
equity
--
in
real
property
had
a
similar
rule
but
since
the
lazarus
case
and
i
think
this
is
really
undisputed
the
lower
federal
courts,
the
circuits
have
uniformly
applied
the
lazarus
principle
to
analyze
the
sale-and-leasebacks
with
the
inquiry
at
who
made
the
capital
investment
and
that
person
or
that
entity
should
get
the
proper
tax
deductions.
i
think
the
things
starts
from
lazarus
but
we
now
have
a
settled
jurisprudence
with
the
intermediate
appellate
courts,
commissioners
rulings
and
what
have
you
which
set
forth
the
basic
federal
principles.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
record
does
not
show,
although
my
information
is
that
for
this
particular
taxable
year,
worthen
was
audited.
in
other
words,
the
audits
proceeded
side-by-side
so
that
somebody
would
get
it
and
that
the
worthen
case
was
settled
in
favor
of
worthen.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
be
much
harder
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
no
well
yes
and
no
in
the
sense
that
i
think
one
of
the
basic
considerations
in
our
conclusion,
in
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
that
worthen
bank
made
the
capital
investment
is
that
under
the
primary
term
of
the
lease
that
is
the
25
year
term,
when
worthen
was
making
these
payments
which
although
contractually
it
obligated
itself
that
was
paid
by
new
york
life.
it
paid
via
frank
lyon.
it
made
the
capital
investment
because
it
obligated
itself,
it
locked
itself
into
the
deal.
in
other
words
new
york
life
insisted
that
worthen’s
obligation
to
make
the
payments
be
absolute
without
any
deduction
to
set
off
or
counter
claim
and
frank
lyon
assigned
the
lease
to
new
york
life
and
assigned
its
right
to
modify
or
terminate
the
lease.
worthen,
in
fact,
in
turn
agreed
to
that
assignment
and
agreed
that
it
would
not
cancel
the
lease.
so
you
have
a
situation
and
i
think
that
fact
is
significant
that
worthen
by
making
these
payments
and
being
legally
obligated,
the
documents
themselves
make
it
legally
obligated
to
make
these
payments
which
pay
off
the
mortgage
that
in
effect
it
has
made
the
capital
investment.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
option
price
is
established
a
second
and
basic
point
which
the
courts
have
emphasized
in
this
area
and
that
is
the
option
prices
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
way
that
frank
lyon
co.
could
get
anymore
than
$500,000
compounded
at
6%
in
this
deal,
because
if
worthen
exercised
the
option
at
any
point
down
the
line
that
is
the
11th,
15th,
25th
year,
those
option
prices
in
the
record
is
undisputed
on
this
point
were
calculated
precisely
to
give
frank
lyon
$500,000
back
compounded
at
6%
interest.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
there
are
two
operative
principles
in
this
area
established
by
this
court
which
make
this
question
freely
reviewable
on
appeal
and
let
me
just
briefly
mention
the
lazarus
case
itself
stated
that
in
the
field
of
taxation,
administrators
of
the
laws
and
the
courts
are
concerned
with
substance
and
realities
and
formal
written
documents
are
not
rigidly
binding
that
we
take
that
to
mean
and
the
courts
have
taken
to
mean
that
if
frank
lyon
calls
itself
an
owner
in
these
documents
and
worthen
bank
calls
itself
a
lessee
that
those
labels,
that
nomenclature
is
not
controlling.
indeed,
i
suppose
it,
'a'
were
to
enter
in
to
a
document
with
'b'
and
called
it
a
lease
and
say,
i
am
going
to
lease
you
these
premises
for
$100,000
for
one
payment
in
perpetuity
that
that
would
be
rent
by
the
terms
of
the
document
but
it
would
be
clearly
be
a
sale.
now,
the
second
point
and
this
is
a
point
which
i
think
needs
addressing
because
mr.
griswold
mentioned
the
party’s
expectations
that
more
than
17
years
ago
in
the
duberstein
case
the
court
said
with
some
compelling
force,
i
think
that
it
scarcely
needs
adding
that
the
party’s
expectations
or
hopes
as
to
the
tax
treatment
of
their
conduct
in
themselves
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
the
district
court
had
a
role
to
play
to
here,
but
our
point
as
we
fully
elaborated
in
our
brief
is
that
the
district
court’s
findings
to
--
whether
they
are
accurate
or
not,
did
not
analyze
the
transaction
fully.
let
me
elaborate
on
that
if
i
may
because
it
is
a
matter
of
some
concern
between
the
parties.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
if
i
may
call
the
court’s
attention
to
page
6
(a)
of
the
appendix
we
are
actually
going
to
the
bottom
of
5
(a)
looking
at
the
district
court’s
findings.
the
district
court
makes
findings
as
to
the
annual
rent
during
the
primary
term
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
this
is
finding
number
6
at
the
bottom
of
5
(a)
actually.
the
district
court
said
the
annual
rent
for
the
first
eleven
years
was
so
much
and
so
much
and
the
annual
rent
for
the
next
14
years
was
so
much.
they
went
on
to
say,
the
rent
on
the
building
during
the
option
periods
totaling
40
years,
turning
over
to
6
(a)
is
$300,000
per
year.
the
evidence
reflected
and
the
court
finds
that
the
rent
to
be
paid
by
worthen
during
the
term
of
lease
is
reasonable.
the
fact
not
contested
by
the
defendant.
well,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
the
fact
that
the
rents
were
reasonable
during
the
primary
term
is
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry
and
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry
because
the
district
court’s
finding
that
the
building
rent
of
$300,000
a
year
for
the
next
40
years
is
reasonable,
while
not
erroneous,
misapprehended
the
fact
that
was
brought
out
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
argument,
the
effect
of
the
ground
lease
settled
because
as
you
can
see
on
page
7
(a)
the
ground
lease
rents
after
the
first
25
years
started
to
mount
up
quite
substantially
and
those
sharp
increases
in
the
ground
lease
had
the
effect
of
sharply
decreasing
the
building
rent.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
and
the
footnote
in
our
brief
was
inadvertent.
the
ground
lease
would
only
terminate
upon
condemnation
or
taking
or
upon
worthen’s
exercise
of
the
options.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no
let
me
say
this
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
district
court’s
finding
can
only
be
fairly
read
to
say
that
the
reasonable
rent
was
$300,000
a
year
for
40
years.
point
of
the
matter
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right
but
their
point
is
that
was
not
the
real
rent.
the
real
rent
that
worthen
was
going
to
have
to
pay
if
it
went
into
this
option
period,
the
renewal
period
was
going
to
be
first
$200,000
a
year
and
then
ultimately
for
25
years
was
only
going
to
be
$50,000
a
year
and
worthen’s
own
president
characterize
that
as
a
very
very
cheap
price.
now,
let
me
make
another
point
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
worthen
is
always
going
to
get
the
ground
rent
if
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
but
the
point
is
in
this
particular
transaction,
is
it
not
the
important
point
that
worthen
was
going
to
pay
a
sharply
reduced
building
rent
and
that
building
rent
when
you
figure
it
out
over
the
40
year
period
again
was
going
to
be
downed
to
frank
that
that
was
only
going
to
pay
off
frank
lyon
to
the
$500,000
compounded
at
6%
interest.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
have
been
slightly
sure
at
that
point
which
seems
to
me
that
that
indicates
that
it
was
not
even
going
to
get
$500,000.
all
my
point
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
now
that
risk
goes
other,
i
mean
our
point
is
that
the
risk
goes
the
other
way.
in
other
words
that
frank
lyon
in
this
deal
could
only
hope
to
get
$500,000
compounded
at
6%
interest.
it
might
get
back
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
at
the
end
of
the
65th
year
they
might
get
more
if
they
could
rented
for
more
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
may
i
suggest
that
if
the
building
turned
out
to
be
terribly
valuable
that
worthen
probably
would
have
exercised
its
option
to--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
assuming
they
wanted
to
be
in
the
building.
i
think
the
important
point
in
our
discussions
indicated
is
that
well,
frank
lyon
had
some
upswing
during
that
last
ten
years.
it
was
basically
limited
to
$500,000,
the
whole
deal
was
structured
to
permit
it
to
receive
no
more
than
$500,000
compounded
at
6%
interest.
i
think
that
that
is
demonstrated
from
the
condemnation
in
taking
provisions
because
at
any
point
during
the
transaction,
if
the
government
condemned
or
was
destroyed
frank
lyon
would
--
first
the
mortgage
would
have
to
be
paid
off
because
new
york
life
was
not
going
to
jeopardize
its
position.
then
frank
lyon
would
get
$500,000
compounded
at
6%
interest
and
then
any
excess
would
go
to
worthen.
the
point
that
we
think
is
significant
here
and
the
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
emphasized
is
that
any
appreciation,
any
upswing
if
this
thing
turned
out
to
be
terribly
valuable
worthen
would
benefit
from
the
appreciation,
to
us
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
ownership
of
property,
if
you
own
real
property
and
it
goes
up
in
value,
if
you
are
an
owner
you
expect
to
be
able
to
to
benefit
from
that
appreciation
and
the
property
but
you
do
not
expect
have
it
be
taken
away
from
someone
in
a
set
of
documents
who
calls
itself
a
lessee,
and
if
that
someone
can
take
it
away,
even
though
it
calls
itself
a
lessee
we
submit
that
that
indicates
that
the
transaction
may
simply
be
a
loan
and
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
it
went
down
in
value
drastically
went
down
in
value
then
frank
lyon
would
not
get
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
purpose
of
the
depreciation
deduction
as
justice
brandeis
said
a
long
time
ago
in
moody
is
to
permit
a
deduction
for
spreading
the
cost
of
an
asset
over
the
period
of
the
investment,
but
the
point
is,
frank
lyon
has
put
$500,000
in
this
building
and
has
set
up
the
transaction
in
a
way
to
ensure
that
it
will
never
have
to
pay
a
penny
of
its
own
money
to
pay
off
the
mortgage.
worthen
is
locked
into
paying
off
the
mortgage
and
on
this
$500,000
investment
it
is
seeking
depreciation
deductions
in
excess
of
$7
million.
to
us
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
other
side
of
the
coin
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true,
but
the
options
to
purchase
and
the
options
to
renew
in
our
view,
emphasize
the
fact
that
frank
lyon
was
limited
to
what
it
could
get
out
of
his
deal,
limited
to
cover
its
$500,000
compounded
at
6%,
much
like
any
note
holder.
in
other
words,
the
way
the
deal
really
worked
when
you
strip
it
down
its
essentials
is
that
worthen
spent
the
first
25
years
paying
off
the
new
york
life
mortgage
and
then
it
was
to
going
to
spend
the
next
40
years
if
it
did
not
exercise,
if
did
not
pay
it
off
immediately
paying
off
the
frank
lyon
what
i
would
call
the
frank
lyon
mortgage.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
record
does
not
tell
us
what
the
depreciable
life
of
the
building
is
but
we
have
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
appropriate
treasury
guidelines
in
this
area
call
for
a
45
year
use
for
life
for
such
an
office
building
and
that
if
i
may
let
me
pursue
that
for
a
moment
mr.
justice
stevens
because
i
think
it
is
significant
where
you
have
--
if
taking
it
from
the
other
side
of
the
transaction,
if
you
look
at
it
from
worthen’s
point
of
view,
worthen
has
in
effect
paid
off
a
mortgage
over
25
years
and
called
it
rent
and
in
effect
will
be
getting
writing
off,
the
cost
of
this
building
over
25
years,
if
this
transaction
has
to
be
honored
by
the
tax
collector
when
the
treasury
use
for
life
of
this
building
is
45
years.
that
leads
me
to
a
point
i
want
to
make
about
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
the
bank
failed
mr.
justice
powell,
frank
lyon
will
be
looking
down
this
note,
we
do
not
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
we
think
that
since
this
has
been
mentioned
that
the
worthen
bank
is
a
substantial
bank
in
arkansas,
i
would
think
that
that
is
despite
the
confusion
over
its
capital
i
would
submit
that
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
yes
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
of
course
that
is
new
york
city
--anything
could
happen
there.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
policy
mr.
justice
powell
we
submit
is
that
when
congress
enacts
these
deductions
and
commits
people
to
claim
them,
it
assumes
and
is
necessarily
a
rationale
system
has
to
assume
this
that
the
proper
person
is
going
to
claim
these
deductions.
now,
in
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
in
other
words,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
conclusion,
in
other
words,
if
someone
goes
to
the
doctor
and
spends
money
for
a
doctor
you
would
assume
that
that
person
would
be
eligible
for
the
medical
deduction.
now,
here
we
have
a
two-party
transaction.
worthen
bank
and
frank
lyon,
the
depreciation
deduction
as
i
have
mentioned
is
key
to
capital
investment.
in
other
words,
who
made
the
capital
investment?
here
is
a
situation
where
worthen
bank
has
locked
itself
into
a
deal
and
committed
itself
to
pay
$7
million
for
a
building
over
25
years.
it
has
managed
to
call
it
rent
in
the
documents
but
in
fact
it
is
buying
a
building.
we
submit
that
it
is
the
proper
party
to
claim
the
depreciation
deductions
and
the
fact
that
it
has
bargained
them
away
so
to
speak
to
someone
else.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
let
me
address
that
point
mr.
chief
justice,
under
the
banking
regulations
petitioner
has
claimed
that
it
could
not
own
this
building
but
as
we
read
the
statute
and
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
banking
regulations
simply
required
that
it
seek
permission
from
the
federal
banking
authorities
before
it
made
an
investment
in
its
building
in
excess
of
its
capital.
it
sought
that
permission
and
the
banking
authorities
gave
its
blessing
to
this
arrangement
and
in
fact
called
one
of
the
letters
called
it
a
method
of
financing.
this
is
a
very
standard
of
financing
a
building
but
it
must
be
looked
at
as
simply
that,
a
method
of
financing.
the
courts
have
so
looked
at
it.
the
authorities,
the
articles
have
looked
at
it
and
in
that
sense
mr.
justice
powell
we
think
the
policy
has
to
be
that
the
proper
person
claimed
the
deduction.
now,
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
record
is
silent
on
this
point
we
do
not
know
what
the
tax
positions
of
frank
lyon
co.
and
the
worthen
bank
are
for
any
of
these
years
in
issue,
but
i
can
say
that
my
examination
of
the
litigated
cases
and
the
sun
oil
case
which
we
have
cited
and
which
we
have
set
forth
in
a
supplemental
memorandum
which
the
third
circuits
just
decided,
it
specifically
approved
the
kind
of
analysis
that
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
engaged
in
that
essentially,
the
tax
policy
has
to
be
that
the
right
person
claims
the
deduction.
and
as
i
was
saying
to
pick
up
the
point
that
normally
in
these
situations,
the
tax
positions
of
the
parties
are
entirely
diverse
and
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
corporation
in
a
lower
effective
bracket,
once
they
finance
a
building
and
trades
off
its
tax
deductions
to
a
wealthy
individual.
down
the
row,
this
is
a
long
deal,
a
bank
like
worthen
co.
after
all,
banks
are
subject
to
special
tax
treatment
and
have
special
ways
to
write
off
bad
debts,
the
worthen
bank
may
have
losses
at
some
point.
it
may
have
anticipated
that
it
had
losses
and
this
was
a
kind
of
deal
that
it
could
arrange
with
someone
like
frank
lyon
co.
which
was
a
burgeoning
and
profitable
business
to
shelter
its
income
because
what
happens
at
the
end
of
this
whole
deal
is
frank
lyon
co.
has
$3
million
of
deductions
over
the
first
11
years
of
this
deal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
think
if
i
may
that
that
is
what
happened,
the
banking
authorities
simply
permitted
the
worthen
bank
to
finance
this
building
in
this
particular
sort
of
way.
in
giving
its
approval
to
this
transaction
the
banking
authorities
in
no
sense
so
to
speak
to
what
the
tax
consequences
of
the
deal
would
be.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
own
the
building
for
tax
purposes,
in
other
words,
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
am
saying
is
that
the
bank
--
well
first
let
me
repeat
a
point
i
made
earlier,
and
that
is
i
do
not
think
it
was
illegal
for
the
bank
to
own
this
building.
that
is
not
the
way
we
read
title
12
of
u.s.c.
371
(d).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
were
required
to
give
approval.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
the
banking
authorities
gave
that
approval.
now,
in
giving
that
approval
to
this
mode
of
transaction,
i
think
what
the
banking
authorities
were
concerned
with
is
making
sure
that
worthen
bank
did
not
carry
this
building
on
its
books
and
they
were
able
to
satisfy
the
banking
authorities
that
it
would
not
be
doing
that
indeed
it
is
not
the
nominal
title
holder
but
the
court
in
lazarus
40
years
ago,
said
that
nominal
title
holding
is
not
significant
in
terms
of
who
gets
tax
deductions
attributable
to
the
ownership
of
property.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
banking
authorities
permitted
the
transaction
as
we
see
it
and
the
undisputed
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
banking
authorities
were
addressing
themselves
to
entirely
different
point.
i
think
that
they
were
concerned,
we
are
making
sure
that
the
bank
was
not
over
extending
itself
in
someway
to
the
detriment
of
its
depositors
and
i
think
that
the
bank
convinced
them
that
this
would
not
be
a
problem,
but
in
fact
the
bank
if
you
look
at
the
undisputed
legal
import
of
the
deal
as
the
parties
made
it,
the
bank
obligated
itself
to
pay
rent
absolutely
without
any
set
off
or
deduction
for
the
first
25
years
of
the
term
and
that
obligation
had
the
effect
of
paying
off
the
new
york
life
mortgage.
from
the
tax
collectors’
point
of
view
that
obligation
looks
very
much
not
like
rent.
let
me
close
if
i
may.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
when
the
government
rents
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
whole
building.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yeah,
the
government
is
a
good
tenant,
i
am
sure
what
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
banking
authorities
were
interested
in
who
was
carrying
this
bank
on
its
books.
i
think
the
tax
authorities
are
concerned
with
who
is
obligated
to
pay
off
this
thing
and
be
obligated
to
that
extent
i
suppose
that
is
right
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
confusion
that
necessarily
operates
to
the
detriment
of
private
parties.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
in
this
area
have
been
settled
for
a
long
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
when
the
lyon
co.
signs
a
personal
note
for
this
building
but
manages
to
hook
on
the
worthen
bank
and
lock
it
into
the
deal
and
say
you
got
to
pay
me
every
month.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
note
was
simply
the
nomenclature
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
if
the
bank
defaulted
lyon
would
have
to
pay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
they
did
not
own
it
because
they
locked
in
worthen
bank
to
pay
off.
it
is
simply
lyon
is
really
in
the
posture
of
a
guarantor
because
worthen
bank
has
to
make
these
payments.
it
is
a
substantial
entity
and
if
for
some
reason
it
fails
then
the
guarantor
has
to
take
over
but
guarantors
are
not
entitled
to
deductions
until
the
operative
facts
upon
which
they
guarantee
is
premise
to
rises.
that
is
our
point
if
essentially,
if
frank
lyon
co.
ultimately
found
itself
holding
the
bag
on
this
thing
then
and
then
only
would
it
be
entitled
to
a
depreciation
deduction
because
it
would
then
be
forced
to
have
an
investment
in
this
building
until
then
we
submit
that
it
was
really
simply
a
passerby
who
was
receiving
these
rental
payments
from
worthen
bank
and
transmitting
them
by
contractual
arrangement
to
new
york
life
insurance
company.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
