unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold
i
take
it
no
one
--
you
tell
me
does
any
one
question
that
these
were
independent
companies
and
not
the
bargains
rentals
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold
could
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second
what
if
the
other
$3
million
represent
and
was
it
part
of
that
--?
unknown
speaker
so
that
$3
million
really
is
not
part
of
the
packet
sold
to
lyon?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
the
cost
to
worthen
of
the
facilities
that
were
sold
to
lyon
was
about
$7,500,000?
unknown
speaker
i
see
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
its
principal
business
mr.
griswold?
unknown
speaker
what
is
its
principal
business,
the
lyon
your
client
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold
was
lyon
a
corporation?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold
you
mean
decreased,
don't
you.
if
you
increase
the
ground
rent,
you
decreased
the
building
rent?
unknown
speaker
in
the
effect
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
effect
of
increasing
the
ground
rent
later
was
to
decrease
than
that
rent
paid
by
the
lessee?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
while
you
are
on
that
point
why
it
was
that
they
made
a
substantial
ground
rent
after
the
first
25
years,
i
think
it
was
rather
than
simply
reducing
the
rent
on
the
building?
unknown
speaker
lyon
was
liable?
unknown
speaker
but
did
it
give
reasons
for
that
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
any
finding
about
the
possibility
of
increasing
its
capital?
unknown
speaker
worthen
is
a
very
small
bank
with
the
capitalization
of
only
$4
million?
unknown
speaker
and
building,
this
$9
million
building
that
was
certainly
more
than
just
the
offices
of
a
small
bank
then?
unknown
speaker
and
what
kind
of
building
was
this
mr.
griswold,
was
it
more
than
just
the
offices
of
a
small
bank
was
it
not,
of
a
small
bank
that
have
--
was
that
an
office
building
generally
or
--?
unknown
speaker
i
share
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry.
i
have
been
under
the
impression
that
worthen
is
one
of
the
major
banks
in
little
rock
and
this
$4
million
figure
does
seem
to
me
to
be
almost
under
capitalization
per
se
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold,
may
i
return
to
the
option
--
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
an
exercise
of
the
option
to
purchase
at
the
end
of
25
years,
price
of
$2
million,
one
i
think
it
was,
is
not
one
reason
why
the
bank
was
unlikely
to
exercise
the
option
of
purchase
was
that
the
present
value
of
the
extended
lease
term
was
a
lesser
value
of
something
$8
million
and
therefore
there
would
be
no
reason
to
take
the
purchase,
they
probably
could
have
bargained
for
the
purchase
of
the
building
for
less
than
the
$2
million
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
somewhat
more
favorable,
there
is
difference
between
$2
million
one
and
$1
million
eight,
as
i
read
it
--
do
i
correctly
understand
the
basic
economy
that
the
value
of,
if
they
renewed
on
the
lease
basis
rather
than
the
purchase
it
would
be
like
buying
it
for
$8
million?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
i
understand
your
side
of
the
case
on
this
mr.
griswold.
do
you
dispute
the
figure,
i
do
not
know
that
is
a
finding
or
just
in
the
briefs
that
$8
million
is
a
fair
estimation
of
the
value
of
the
--?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
that
the
implication
of
what
you
have
just
said
mr.
smith
and
i
guess
it
is
clear
in
your
brief,
that
you
do
concede
that
somebody
is
entitled
to
the
deductions
for
interest
and
depreciation
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
is
worthen?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
i
am
just
curious,
you
just
said
that
worthen
was
entitled
to
it.
does
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
whether
the
worthen
in
fact
has
received
the
benefit
of
these
deductions?
unknown
speaker
it
is
in
the
situation
of
the
statute
limitations
having
around
as
is
usually
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
if
the
primary
inquiry
is
as
you
phrase
it,
who
made
the
capital
investment
will
the
government’s
position
be
precisely
the
same
if
there
were
no
options
involved
in
the
case.
no
options
to
renew
or
options
to
purchase?
unknown
speaker
and
the
capital
considerations
all
not
be
precisely
the
same?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
in
answering
justice
stevens’
question
a
moment
ago
you
referred
our
conclusion
and
then
you
corrected
yourself
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
finish
my
question
if
i
may
--
just
how
free
either
you
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
to
substitute
judgments
as
to
what
the
realities
of
a
transaction
was
for
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
you
would
take
both
of
the
principles,
you
have
just
stated
as
agreed
to
that
still
does
not
fully
delineate
the
scope
of
what
is
finally
concluded
by
the
district
court’s
findings
and
what
appellate
courts
and
commissioner
may
and
the
taxpayer
may
speculate
about
as
to
probabilities
of
things
happening
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
in
that
process
would
you
say
specifically
what
was
clearly
erroneous
in
the
district
court’s
findings?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
volume
1,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
is
it
correct
as
your
adversary
points
out
or
says
that
had
the
option
to
renew
not
been
exercised
lyon
would
have
remained
liable
for
these
ground
rents
during
that
extent
of
period?
unknown
speaker
but
with
that
in
mind
it
is
true
the
district
court’s
finding
does
not
explain
the
fact
that
the
net
income
will
be
the
difference
between
the
building
lease
and
the
ground
lease
but
the
finding
is
really
a
realistic
finding
under
that
--?
unknown
speaker
well,
building
in
which
the
owner
has
to
pay
ground
rent
is
of
the
certain
amount.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
fair,
supposing
they
had
rented
a
comparable
building
on
some
third
party’s
land
and
paid
$300,000
for
it
and
that
was
a
fair
price,
they
would
still
get
income
from
the
ground
lease
to
lyon
to
net
it
out
anyway.
do
you
not
still
look
at
the
fair
rental
value
of
that
which
they
are
renting,
because
they
always
are
going
to
get
the
ground
rent?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
whether
they
would
rent
this
building
or
they
rent
any
building
on
neighboring
property?
unknown
speaker
is
it
even
that
completely
correct,
is
it
not
correct
that
if
there
had
not
been
an
exercise,
if
all
of
the
options
have
been
exercised
then
the
matter
would
run
its
course
so
that
the
end
of
the
65
year
period
lyon
owned
the
building
and
had
the
land
there,
it
would
not
have
not
gotten
its
$500,000
plus
6%
compounded
unless
it
got
some
additional
value
during
the
ten
year
(inaudible)
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
a
risk
as
to
whether
they
get
the
6%
in
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
building
turned
out
to
be
very
very
valuable
at
the
end
of
the
65th
year?
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
not
conceivable
with
the
said
effects
that
depending
on
what
happens,
they
could
have
gotten
either
more
or
less
than
$500,000
plus
6%
compound?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
the
lyon
would
have
probably
charged
him
a
handsome
rent
for
the
last
11
years?
unknown
speaker
but
look
at
it
from
the
other
side,
mr.
smith.
you
say
if
it
appreciated
in
value
as
likely
worthen
would
have
exercised
its
options
and
retained
control
but
supposing
it
went
down
in
value
farther
than
the
parties
anticipated
who
assumes
the
risk
if
that
happened?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
depreciation
deduction
to
protect
against
increases
or
decreases
in
value?
unknown
speaker
but
my
point
earlier
mr.
smith
well,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
have
answered
as
to
best
you
can,
that
would
all
be
true
even
if
there
were
no
options
to
purchase
or
options
to
renew
on
the
part
of
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
just
one
other
informational
question,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
depreciable
life
of
the
building
was?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
before
you
move
on
to
the
next
point,
you
assume
of
course
that
the
bank
will
pay
off
its
rental
obligation
and
it
is
a
likely
assumption
that
i
would
concede
but
a
number
of
banks
do
fail,
including
(inaudible)
in
that
event,
who
would
be
responsible
for
things
--
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
could
name
a
substantial
bank
in
new
york
city
that
--?
unknown
speaker
and
the
amount
of
trouble
could
it
not
--?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
since
i
have
interrupted
you
let
me
come
back
to
a
fundamental
of
what
policy
that
the
united
states
and
if
the
internal
revenue
service
is
saved
back
this
litigation,
i
understand
you
concede
that
someone
is
entitled.
i
think
you
said
the
bank
to
the
depreciation
and
the
interest
deductions.
now
granted
in
a
particular
case
that
it
may
fall
in
the
government’s
favor
or
it
may
fall
against
the
government
depending
on
the
tax
posture
of
the
taxpayer
at
the
moment,
but
what
policy
is
that?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
law
of
the
state
it
could
not
buy
a
building
of
that
cost
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
that
you
have
answered
my
question
at
some
length
of
that
policy
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
but
let
me
move
to
another
semi
policy
question.
the
federal
reservoir
approved
this
transaction,
if
it
had
not,
the
bank
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
it
had
conceded
the
transaction
was
made
but
a
bona
fide
transaction.
the
another
agency
of
the
government
comes
along
and
says
in
effect,
number
one,
the
transaction
was
really
illegal
because
your
position
is
that
the
bank
still
owns
a
building,
if
it
owns
a
building
it
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
now,
what
parties
do
in
these
circumstances
when
one
arm
of
the
government
tells
them
go
ahead
with
the
transaction
we
have
examined
it
and
we
have
approved
it,
the
internal
revenue
service
comes
along
several
years
later
and
takes
a
different
view?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
my
suggestion.
unknown
speaker
the
banking
authorities
were
interested
to
own
the
building
and
that
is
the
bad
rock
of
your
case?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
are
saying
that
the
distinction
between
legal
ownership
of
the
building
and
ownership
of
--
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
required
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
have
you
not
got
something
more
here
than
nominal
title,
would
it
be
prudent
banking
to
have
a
bank
own
a
building
valued
at
about
twice
its
capitalization?
do
you
think
any
banking
authority
would
have
approved
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
banking
authorities
were
simply
winking
at
the
idea?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
you
have
so
much
in
lots
of
other
places
where
the
government
rents
a
whole
building,
what
happens
to
the
taxes
on
that?
unknown
speaker
a
whole
building.
unknown
speaker
like
(inaudible)
a
point.
unknown
speaker
leases
a
whole
building?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
point
is
that
in
the
government
ownership
means
something
in
one
department,
there
is
something
else
in
another
department?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
you
submit
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
let
me
ask
--?
unknown
speaker
then
what
good
was
the
note?
unknown
speaker
the
note
had
built
so
that
it
felt
through
lyon
got
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
own
it?
