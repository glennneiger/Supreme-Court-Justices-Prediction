mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case.
it
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
a
judgment
for
the
taxpayer
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
arkansas.
the
question
involved
is
the
effect
of
a
sale
lease-back
transaction,
involving
a
bank
building
between
the
petitioner
frank
lyon
co.
as
leaser
and
the
worthen
bank
&
trust
company
as
lessee.
before
stating
the
facts,
i
would
like
to
place
them
in
context
by
briefly
indicating
the
basic
approach
which
we
take
in
this
case.
in
planning
a
substantial
business
venture
of
the
sort
involved
here,
taxpayers
should
be
able
to
predict
the
tax
consequences
with
some
degree
of
certainty.
to
this
end
the
tax
collectors
should
avoid
applying
the
tax
laws
to
frustrate
bona
fide
bargains
unless
he
can
point
to
some
reason
for
doing
so
which
is
pragmatically
based
in
tax
policy.
this
does
not
mean
that
taxpayers
should
be
allowed
to
manipulate
tax
consequences
with
arbitrary
labels
or
with
maneuvers
which
have
no
economic
substance,
but
neither
should
the
tax
lawyers
be
a
joker
in
the
deck
for
a
business
planning.
in
a
situation
where
ownership
is
inevitably
divided
and
that
is
true
of
most
business
property.
no
transaction
can
be
safely
planed
if
its
tax
consequences
are
made
to
depend
on
an
abstract
comparison
of
the
ownership
of
bundles
of
sticks
which
various
parties
carry.
the
policy
for
which
we
argue
is
in
effect
that
there
should
be
a
presumption
in
favor
of
taxing
bona
fide
business
transactions
as
they
were
bargained,
structured
and
understood
by
the
parties,
particularly
whereas
here
there
is
no
realistic
tax
policy
reason
for
scrambling
the
bargain
which
was
made
between
frank
lyon
co.
and
the
worthen
bank.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
your
honor
that
is
not
question
they
were
independent.
there
is
one
--
the
president
of
frank
lyon
co.
is
a
director
of
worthen
bank
but
the
court
found
that
they
were
independent
and
that
is
not
now
contested.
worthen
bank
in
little
rock
for
many
years
in
1967
add
a
capital
of
$4
million.
it
decided
to
build
a
new
building
and
it
was
able
to
obtain
a
desirable
site.
it
retained
an
architect
and
build
a
public
parking
garage
on
an
adjoining
track.
the
total
project
would
cost
about
$12
million
of
which
about
$1,500,000
was
the
cost
of
the
land
and
$7,500,000
was
the
cost
of
the
bank
building
on
this
particular
piece
of
land.
the
bank
sought
approval
for
the
financing
of
the
building
from
the
state
banking
commission
of
arkansas
and
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
st.
louis.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
have
represented
an
adjoining
track
which
included
a
parking
garage,
several
stories
high
which
was
integrated
in
the
ultimate
project,
but
was
not
a
part
of
the
leases
involved
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
$3
million
is
not
the
part
of
this
case
except
that
it
consumed
most
of
the
$4
million
which
was
the
maximum
that
worthen
bank
could
invest
in
bank
premises.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
lyon
paid
essentially
the
cost.
there
was
a
contract
by
which
lyon
agreed
to
pay
not
in
excess
of
$7,640,000
and
that
is
the
exact
amount
which
they
paid.
they
were
advised
by
the
banking
authorities
that
worthen
could
not
legally
own
the
building
either
directly
or
through
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
at
a
cost
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
its
capital
stock
which
was
then
$4
million
and
that
is
section
25
(a)
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
in
addition
to
this
legal
obstacle
there
was
also
a
practical
barrier,
worthen
bank
had
planned
to
have
a
$5
million
conventional
mortgage
and
to
issue
$4
million
in
debentures,
but
arkansas
law
forbade
worthen
from
paying
more
than
6%
on
debentures
and
the
bond
simply
were
not
marketable
at
that
rate.
in
this
situation,
worthen
sought
both
legal
and
financial
advice.
it
consulted
a
number
of
potential
investors
and
lenders
including
goldman
sachs
&
company
and
eastman
dillon,
union
securities
company
of
new
york.
it
also
made
preliminary
contact
with
the
first
national
city
bank
of
new
york
for
interim
financing
and
with
new
york
life
insurance
company
for
a
long
term
loan
on
the
completed
building.
in
the
course
of
these
discussions,
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
practical
and
legal
problems
could
be
solved
by
a
sale
and
leaseback
with
an
independent
buyer
and
leaser.
after
these
discussions
were
well
underway,
frank
lyon
co.
decided
to
enter
the
competition.
lyon
as,
i
have
said
is
an
independent
company,
thought
its
chairman,
frank
lyon
is
a
director
of
worthen
bank.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
their
principal
business
was
the
central
midwest
distributorship
for
whirlpool
and
zenith,
but
they
had
by
this
time
also
begun
to
branch
out
and
do
other
thing
and
among
other
things
at
about
this
time,
they
bought
the
controlling
interest
in
another
bank
in
little
rock
and
they
were
engaging
in
other
business
activities
but
their
basic
business
was
the
distributorship
for
zenith
and
whirlpool.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
frank
lyon
co.
is
an
incorporation
yes.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
frank
lyon
co.
underbid
the
other
potential
buyers
by
reducing
the
rent
payable
by
worthen
for
the
building
by
$21,000
a
year
for
each
of
the
first
five
years
and
on
this
basis
frank
lyon
co.
was
accepted
by
worthen
as
the
investor
owner
and
lyon
was
approved
by
the
financing
agencies.
after
extensive
further
negotiations,
lyon
entered
into
a
number
of
agreements
both
with
worthen
and
the
financial
institutions
and
there
was
first
a
ground
lease
by
which
worthen
leased
the
land
to
lyon
for
a
term
of
76
years
and
7
months.
that
was
actually
a
year
and
seven
months
for
a
construction
and
75
years
after
the
end
of
this.
the
idea
for
leasing
the
ground
had
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
new
york
financiers
as
a
way
of
simplifying
the
ultimate
transaction.
there
was
secondary
sales
agreement
by
which
worthen
sold
the
building
to
lyon
and
this
is
interesting
but
i
do
not
think
readily
significant.
bit
by
bit
as
it
was
built
for
a
price
not
exceeding
$7,640,000
as
each
piece
of
material
was
incorporated
in
the
building,
it
was
sold
to
lyon.
now,
this
was
adopted
because
worthen
bank
could
not
own
banking
premises
in
excess
of
its
capital
and
if
it
built
the
whole
building
and
then
sold
it
they
would
have
violated
the
law
and
also
because
worthen
bank
was
not
subject
to
the
arkansas
sales
tax
on
the
materials
which
would
have
amounted
to
something
like
$125,000.
finally,
there
was
a
building
lease
by
which
lyon
leased
the
building
to
worthen
for
a
term
of
25
years
subject
to
two
sets
of
options.
there
were
first
four
options
to
purchase
the
building
at
stated
figures,
at
the
end
of
the
11th
,
15th
,
20th
and
25th
years
of
the
lease
and
the
basic
term
of
the
lease,
the
original
term
of
the
lease
was
25
years
and
then
there
were
eight
options
to
renew
the
lease,
beginning
with
the
25th
year
for
consecutive
five
year
periods.
if
all
the
options
to
renew
or
exercise,
worthen
bank
would
occupy
the
premises
for
a
total
of
65
years,
but
that
still
after
a
term
of
ten
years
at
the
end,where
lyon’s
ground
lease
would
continue
and
it
would
have
full
entitlement
to
the
building
no
matter
of
what.
the
transactions
became
effective
on
may
1st
1968.
during
the
construction
period,
frank
lyon
co.
borrowed
the
money
to
finance
the
cost
from
first
national
city
bank
of
new
york
in
the
amount
of
$7
million.
it
did
this
on
its
own
note
on
which
it
alone
was
liable,
when
the
building
was
completed
frank
lyon
co.
discharged
this
obligation
to
first
national
city
bank
and
to
worthen
by
putting
in
$500,000
of
its
own
money
and
by
borrowing
$7,140,000
from
new
york
life
insurance
company.
again,
frank
lyon
co.
alone
signed
this
note.
worthen
was
not
a
party
to
it
although
worthen
did
join
in
providing
additional
security
for
the
note
by
mortgaging
the
parking
garage
and
the
land
to
which
it
still
owned
the
fee
and
also
consenting
to
an
assignment
of
the
lease
to
new
york
life.
after
lyon
had
borrowed
the
$7,140,000
from
new
york
life,
it
paid
off
its
debt
to
first
national
city
bank
and
had
$500,000
of
its
own
invested
in
the
project.
the
government
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
rent
for
the
first
25
years
under
the
ground
lease
was
fixed
to
$50.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
record
about
this.
the
lease
itself
says
$50
for
the
term
at
one
place
in
the
finding
that
says
$50
per
year.
i
think
$50
for
the
whole
term
is
correct
i
do
not
think
it
is
of
any
importance.
however
the
amount
of
this
rent
is
entirely
irrelevant,
whatever
rent
was
fixed
for
the
land
during
the
initial
25
year
period
would
inevitably
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
rent
for
the
building
during
this
period.
if
the
rent
to
the
land
had
been
fixed
at
$100,000
a
year,
then
for
simple
economic
reasons
the
rent
for
building
would
have
been
increased
by
$100,000
a
year.
it
was
a
large
transaction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
you
would
have
to
increase
that.
if
lyon
had
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
paid
more
ground
rent
they
would
get
more
building
rent
out
in
order
to
come
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
talking
about
the
initial
25
year
period
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
simply
this
apparently
anomalous
$50
rent
for
the
term.
i
suggest
that
that
is
irrelevant.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
they
contemplated
the
very
real
risk
that
worthen
would
not
renew
the
lease.
that
lyon
would
be
liable
for
the
rent
specified
for
the
next
40
years
at
high
rates,
worthen
could
walk
away
from
it
and
could
collect
in
a
later
period
$250,000
a
year
rent
for
which
worthen
was
liable.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
which
lyon
was
liable.
yes
of
course
mr.
chief
justice.
after
the
first
25
years,
as
i
have
just
said
the
ground
lease
provided
for
substantial
and
increasing
rents
payable
by
lyon
over
the
next
40
years
aggregating
$7,500,000
and
for
the
final
ten
years
of
the
lease,
a
reduced
ground
rent
of
$10,000
a
year
was
provided.
the
government
contends
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
worthen
would
walk
away
from
the
building
at
the
end
of
25
years
or
at
any
subsequent
time,
but
it
is
clear
that
these
escalating
ground
rents
were
designed
to
deal
with
precisely
this
eventuality,
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
that
worthen
would
continue
to
rent
the
building
throughout
the
entire
65
year
term
ground
rentals
of
up
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
would
not
have
been
necessary
just
as
in
the
first
25
years
which
were
binding
on
the
parties.
lyon
also
had
the
absolute
right
to
all
the
improvements
made
by
worthen
to
the
building
at
any
time
the
building
lease
terminates,
lyon
comes
into
full
possession
of
the
building
and
all
its
pertinences.
and
this
shows
a
significant
benefit
of
ownership
for
lyon
and
operates
as
well
to
negate
any
inference
that
the
parties
never
contemplated
worthen
relinquishing
control
of
the
building.
now,
the
ground
lease
must
of
course
be
considered
together
with
the
building
lease.
the
rent
payable
by
the
bank
during
the
first
25
years
of
the
building
lease
exactly
put
lyon
in
funds
to
meet
its
liability
to
new
york
life
on
a
quarterly
basis.
thereafter
as
i
have
said,
the
bank
had
eight
successive
options
to
renew
the
lease
for
five
year
periods,
and
the
rent
for
such
periods
is
fixed
at
$300,000
per
year
and
by
that
time
lyon
has
no
longer
any
obligation
to
the
financial
institutions.
under
the
building
lease,
worthen
bank
had
four
options
to
purchase
the
premises
at
the
end
of
11,
15
and
25
years,
these
options
and
the
purchase
price
appeared
at
page
419
of
the
appendix
they
are
substantial
amounts.
if
worthen
exercised
anyone
of
these
options
to
purchase,
both
the
building
lease
and
the
ground
lease
would
terminate;
however,
if
worthen
did
not
exercise
the
option
to
buy,
the
ground
lease
would
continue
in
full
force
and
frank
lyon
co.
would
be
liable
for
the
aggregate
of
$7,600,000
of
rent
ado
for
the
50
years
remaining
under
the
ground
lease.
in
this
respect
the
government
has
significantly
misstated
the
situation
in
a
footnote
on
page
13
of
its
brief.
i
am
sure
that
this
was
unintentional,
but
it
is
significant.
the
government
says
there
that
and
“the
ground
lease
would
terminate
if
worthen
did
not
renew
the
building
lease”
and
as
i
have
indicated
this
is
not
true,
the
termination
clause
is
paragraph
9
on
page
369
of
the
appendix,
under
this
the
ground
lease
would
terminate
on
the
exercise
of
one
of
the
options
to
buy
under
article
20
of
the
building
lease,
but
there
is
no
provision
for
termination
of
the
ground
lease
on
the
failure
to
exercise
one
of
the
options
to
renew
the
building
lease.
if
the
options
to
renew
expire
at
anytime
between
the
25
and
the
60
year
of
the
lease,
frank
lyon
remains
liable
for
the
rent
stated
on
the
ground
lease
including
the
rental
stipulated
for
the
final
ten
years
of
the
lease
and
during
all
of
this
period
or
potentially
50
years,
if
an
option
to
renew
is
not
exercised
frank
lyon
co.
is
the
unqualified
owner
of
the
building
able
to
deal
with
it
in
anyway
it
thinks
desirable,
lease
it
to
a
new
tenant,
replace
it,
sell
it
or
occupy
it
itself.
this
is
not
a
lease
which
provides
for
a
bargain
purchase.
the
price
is
payable
if
worthen
exercises
the
options
to
buy
are
substantial.
the
trial
court
has
expressly
found
on
evidence
that
“from
page
304
of
the
appendix,
there
has
never
been
any
understanding
or
agreement
between
worthen
and
plaintiff
that
worthen
will
ever
exercise
any
of
its
options
to
purchase”
and
the
trial
court
also
found
and
this
actually
appears
at
three
places
in
the
findings
but
the
quotation
i
gave
is
also
on
page
304,
the
trial
court
found
that
it
is
most
unlikely
and
improbable
that
worthen
will
exercise
its
options
to
purchase
at
the
end
of
the
first
11
years
of
the
lease
or
at
the
end
of
any
of
the
subsequent
option
periods.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
one
of
them
of
course
is
the
same
capital
buying
that
worthen
bank
is
in.
worthen
bank
cannot
exercise
the
option
to
purchase
without
becoming
the
owner
of
a
bank
building
which
in
excess
of
its
capital
which
violates
the
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
there
is
no
finding
about
that.
as
i
recall,
of
course,
there
is
always
the
possibility
but
in
these
days
of
branch
banking
this
applies
to
all
banking
premises
and
the
need
of
a
bank
not
to
put
its
capital
in
the
banking
premises
was
certainly
one
of
the
factors
which
let
the
court
to
come
to
that
finding.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
capital
has
increased
since
1968.
i
do
not
what
it
is,
it
has
not
increased
to
a
chase
manhattan
bank
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
its
capital
has
always
been
small
and
the
record
is
contained
a
number
of
references
from
the
banking
authorities
saying
worthen
bank
has
a
capital
problem,
it
must
increase
its
capital
and
they
were
aware
of
this
and
they
were
working
at
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
worthen
occupied
a
third
of
the
building
at
the
time
it
was
completed
and
they
leased
it
to
other
tenants,
but
they
did
incorporate
end
of
the
building
and
the
adjoining
premises
quite
a
substantial
amount
of
specialized
bank
equipments
such
as
vaults
and
teller’s
cages
and
things
of
that
sort,
but
at
the
time
they
started,
they
occupied
a
third
of
the
building.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
an
authority
on
the
banking
facilities
of
little
rock,
my
knowledge
extends
to
the
fact
that
in
1968
their
capital
was
$4
million
and
that
it
has
increased
somewhat
since
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
that
is
the
line
which
the
government
is
now
pursuing
after
contesting
the
point
vigorously
below,
the
government
now
seems
to
concede
that
it
is
unlikely
that
worthen
will
exercise
a
purchase
option,
but
the
government
maintains
that
the
reason
worthen
will
not
buy
the
building
is
because
of
the
rental
options
are
so
attracting
which
is
essentially
your
point.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
of
course
is
a
question
of
assuming
up
to
25
to
65
years
in
advance
what
interest
rates
will
be
involved,
but
i
think
the
real
difference
is
a
flown
away
of
reasoning
that.
it
is
said
that
it
will
only
cost
worthen
bank
$50,000
to
occupy
this
building
in
the
later
years
because
the
rental
is
$300,000
in
the
later
years
but
the
ground
rent
is
$250,000,
but
that
ignores
the
fact
that
worthen
can
walk
away
and
still
get
the
$250,000.
frank
lyon
is
liable
for
the
rent
on
the
ground
lease
whether
worthen
renews
the
lease
at
all
or
not,
so
the
real
question
is
whether
it
is
advantageous
for
worthen
to
occupy
the
premises
and
in
contrast
to
moving
away
some
place
else,
opening
a
new
building
and
collecting
$250,000
a
year
from
frank
lyon
on
the
old
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
that
we
dispute
that.
we
regard
it
as
not
necessarily
controlling.
there
are
various
reasons
why
worthen
might
not
wish
to
keep
its
bank
there.
the
banking
community
might
move
away
to
other
parts
of
the
city
as
it
has
in
various
places
and
this
was
suggested
by
the
president
of
worthen
bank
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
with
the
development
of
electronic
fund
transfer,
the
whole
nature
of
banking
may
change.
you
may
have
simply
outlets
and
department
stores
and
things
and
your
bank
may
be
out
in
a
suburb.
between
the
two,
it
is
clear
that
the
option
to
renew
is
probably,
mathematically
more
advantageous
than
the
option
to
buy,
but
it
still
does
not
follow
that
the
option
to
renew
the
lease
will
be
exercised
and
if
the
option
to
renew
is
not
exercised,
then
frank
lyon
remains
liable
on
the
ground
lease
for
various
substantial
amounts.
now,
the
government
says
that
frank
lyon
is
a
mere
conduct.
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
the
rental
payments
from
worthen
to
lyon
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
amount
due
from
lyon
to
new
york
life
on
the
long
term,
no.
that
simply
means
that
they
were
not
concerned
with
immediate
cash
flow.
what
it
means
is
that
they
were
looking
for
protection
on
return
to
a
combination
of
tax
benefits
in
the
early
years
or
they
could
use
as
provided
by
law
double
declining
balance
depreciation
and
also
to
profitable
operation
potentially
in
the
years
following
the
25
year
period.
i
have
talked
mostly
about
depreciation.
let
me
talk
briefly
about
interest
deduction.
i
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
any
question
about
that.
section
163
of
the
code
provides
that
there
shall
be
allowed
as
the
deduction
all
interest
paid
or
accrued
in
the
taxable
year
on
indebtedness.
here
frank
lyon
co.
an
independent
entity
was
indebted
to
first
national
city
bank
and
new
york
life
on
its
notes.
it
borrowed
the
money
and
it
paid
interest.
worthen
did
not
borrow
the
money.
worthen
was
not
liable
on
the
notes
and
did
not
guarantee
the
notes.
it
did
not
pay
interest
under
the
statute
it
seems
to
me
clear
the
frank
lyon
co.
should
be
entitled
to
deduct
the
interest.
lyon
is
not
a
finance
company,
it
was
a
an
entrepreneur
in
this
transaction.
it
invested
a
substantial
amount
of
its
own
money
and
it
undertook
large
liability
on
its
notes
and
on
the
ground
lease.
with
reason
and
with
the
advice
of
counsel
both
parties
proceeded
on
the
understanding
that
lyon
is
the
owner
of
the
building
and
is
entitled
to
the
depreciation
deduction.
there
is
no
reason
in
fairness
nor
in
the
terms
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
why
lyon
should
not
have
the
deduction.
there
is
no
need
to
take
the
deduction
away
from
lyon
in
order
to
protect
the
revenue.
there
is,
i
venture
to
say,
no
real
justification
for
a
system
which
says
that
the
depreciation
and
interest
deductions
in
such
a
case
as
this
must
wait
until
the
final
decision
of
the
highest
court.
here,
if
it
had
been
known
that
worthen
was
entitled
to
the
deduction
as
in
effect
held
by
the
court
below
despite
the
fact
that
worthen
could
not
legally
be
the
owner
of
the
building
then
the
parties
could
have
bargained
accordingly.
the
rent
would
necessarily
have
been
that
much
higher.
it
is
important
in
a
case
like
this,
a
three-party
case,
not
a
case
like
some
of
the
others
where
they
are
just
dealing
with
a
finance
company
and
in
the
sun
oil
case
with
a
tax
exempt
pension
fund,
it
is
important
in
a
case
like
this,
a
three-party
case
where
the
owner
leaser
is
not
a
financing
corporation
that
the
transaction
be
given
effect
for
tax
purposes
on
the
basis
established
by
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
this
is
the
conclusion
which
this
court
reached
in
the
lazarus
case.
there
is
no
valid
reason
in
tax
policy
for
not
applying
that
conclusion
here.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i
would
like
to
correct
one
thing
in
the
record.
the
question
as
to
what
worthen
bank
has
been
doing
with
this
depreciation
does
appear
in
the
record.
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
201
and
the
top
of
page
202
where
about
two
inches
below
the
top
of
page
202,
counsel
for
the
government
says,
i
believe
the
bank
has
continued
to
treat
the
transaction
as
it
was
treated
originally
and
though
that
is
perhaps
a
little
inconclusive,
it
was
tied
up
by
trial
counsel
mr.
williamson,
on
page
216
of
the
record
where
he
asked
the
present
of
worthen
bank,
has
worthen
bank
contested
that
determination
or
agreed
to
it
and
president
pennick(ph)
said
we
have
contested
it.
worthen
bank
is
not
accepting
the
determination.
now,
with
respect
to
depreciation,
i
think
that
mr.
smith
has
been
a
little
glib
in
talking
about
45
years,
a
building
has
lots
of
components
including
plumbing
and
mechanical
and
electrical
and
elevators
and
the
depreciation
period
for
them
is
15
years
for
architectural
and
general
construction
it
is
33
years,
and
finally
for
the
structural
frame
it
is
40
years.
the
fact
is
that
a
very
high
proportion
of
this
total
depreciation
is
available
within
25
years
more
than
close
to
90%
and
there
is
not
much
difference
over
the
25
years
between
double
declining
balance
and
straight
line
depreciation
and
then
finally
i
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
perfectly
plain
here
mr.
smith
keeps
saying
in
his
brief
here
that
permission
was
sough
and
it
was
given.
well,
it
was
given
for
the
sale-leaseback
arrangement.
permission
was
sought
to
build
the
building
and
own
it
and
it
was
refused
and
it
is
not
a
purely
cosmetic
matter
of
the
banking
officials
trying
to
keep
this
from
appearing
on
balance
sheet.
if
lyon’s
liability
is
as
lessee
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
worthen
supported
lyon’s
liability,
the
same
way
that
any
building
owner
looks
to
his
tenants
to
pay
the
rent
in
order
that
he
can
pay
the
bank
but
he
has
to
have
--
if
worthen
went
insolvent,
i
am
not
instantly
familiar
with
the
immediate
details
of
the
bankruptcy
law
but
my
recollection
is
that
there
would
be
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
depositors
for
two
years
rent
but
not
for
all
the
future.
on
the
other
hand,
if
worthen
bank
was
liable
on
the
note,
there
would
be
a
claim
in
its
bankruptcy
for
the
entire
amount
of
the
note
and
that
is
a
very
real
difference
and
the
reason
why
the
banking
officials
rightly
would
not
allow
worthen
to
own
the
bank.
thank
you.
