i
take
it
from
your
argument
you
agree
that
if
there
were
to
be
dbls
recognized
what
the
judge
did
here
was
to
dismiss
that
dbl?
justice
byron

he
excluded
evidence
with
respect
to
the
other
charge.
because
he
excluded
the
evidence,
there
was
not
any
evidence
on
the
other
charge.

dismissed,
not
acquitted?
justice
byron

white
what
is
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
in
a
case
of
two
counts
in
an
indictment
and
the
government
offers
evidence
under
both
of
them
and
then
the
defendant
says
“well,
the
second
count
of
the
indictment
really
is
defective.
it
does
not
effectively
charge
a
crime.”
the
court
says
“i
think
that
is
right.
i
am
going
to
dismiss
that
count
and,
of
course,
i
will
then
exclude
the
evidence
the
government
has
offered
to
support
this
crime
that
has
not
been
charged.
it
is
like
the
chicken
and
the
egg.
here,
the
court
did
not
think
that
this
indictment
charge
the
numbers
crime.
is
it
not
true
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
first,
exclude
the
evidence
or
do
you
dismiss
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
he
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
not
think
the
indictment
charged
the
numbers
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
odd
to
say
that
the
judge
entered
an
acquittal
on
a
crime
that
he
thought
the
indictment
did
not
charge?
you
are
not
making
that
contention.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
judge
think
that
a
numbers
crime
was
adequately
charged
in
this
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
a
judge
enter,
or
acquit
the
person
or
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
a
crime
that
he
thought
the
indictment
did
not
even
charge?
