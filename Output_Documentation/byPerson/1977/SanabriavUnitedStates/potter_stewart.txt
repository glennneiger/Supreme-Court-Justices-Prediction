if,
as
my
brother
white
says,
you
are
going
to
recognize
dbls,
which
your
submission
of
course
is
that
you
should
certainly
not
do
it,
he
did
dismiss
that
dbl,
the
one
based
upon
numbers,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
have
fong
foo
case,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
with
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
example,
let
us
say
he
is
wholly
irrationally.
justice
potter
stewart
and
clearly,
conspicuously,
erroneous.
justice
potter
stewart
he
excludes
evidence
and
the
result
is
an
acquittal.
then,
you
have
a
fong
foo
case.
there
was
an
acquittal
and
the
government
cannot
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
said
in
violation
of
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
is
a
component
of
the
federal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fong
foo
case
was
here
as
a
result
of
egregious
errors
that
the
trial
court
had
made
ending
in
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
we
held
that
regardless
of
those
extremely
serious,
almost
irrational
errors,
after
an
acquittal
there
could
not
be
an
appeal
by
the
government
because
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
third?
you
said
there
were
three.
justice
potter
stewart
the
third
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
going
to
get
to
martin
linen,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
easterbrook,
before
you
proceed,
we
were
talking
about
the
indictment,
the
one
alleged.
i
do
not
find
the
indictment
in
the
appendix
or
anywhere
else
here.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
