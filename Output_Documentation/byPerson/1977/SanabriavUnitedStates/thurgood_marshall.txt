justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that,
so
far,
you
admit
that
you
started
out
in
this
case,
decree
the
condition
where
you
would
have
what
you
consider
a
full-proof
double
jeopardy
plan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
you
have
made
the
specious
argument
and
all
that?
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
after
the
judge
ruled
on
the
evidence,
that
there
was
no
way
under
the
sun
that
the
jury
could
legally
convict
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
the
judge
ruled
on
the
evidence
and
excluded
the
evidence,
is
there
any
way
under
the
sun
that
the
jury
could
legally
convict
the
petitioner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
not
be
legally
done
by
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
almost
impossible
for
him
to
do
it,
once
the
judge
probably
instructed
the
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
because
you
and
i
are
too
weak.
we
have
been
practicing
more
than
six
months
too.
but,
my
point
is
that
once
the
judge
took
the
evidence
out
of
the
case,
was
the
judge
then
not
without
more
obliged
to
instruct
the
jury
practically
to
acquit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
done
that,
jeopardy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
judge
have
had
to
instruct
the
jury
that
there
is
no
way
to
convict
this
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
what
is
the
difference?
the
only
difference
is
that,
technically,
defense
counsel
asked
him
to
do
it
which
he
would
have
done
without
the
motion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
can
throw
any
indictment
he
wants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
their
discretion
to
draft
an
illegal
unfair
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
and
tried
along
with
several
others
for
the
federal
offense
of
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
operation.
the
single-count
indictment
alleged
in
part
that
the
gambling
business
violated
a
state
law,
prohibiting
both
horse-race
betting
and
numbers
betting.
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
exclude
all
evidence
of
numbers
betting
on
the
ground
that
the
particular
provision
of
state
law
cited
in
indictment
did
not
actually
prohibit
numbers
betting.
petitioner's
counsel
then
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
contending
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
show
petitioner's
involvement
with
the
horse-race
betting.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
entered
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
on
the
government's
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
first
held
that
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
government's
numbers
betting
theory
and
that
petitioner
had
not
been
acquitted
of
that
offense.
it
therefore
concluded
that
a
new
trial
of
the
petitioner
on
the
charge
relating
only
to
numbers
would
not
be
prohibited
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
trial
court
had
erroneously
excluded
the
evidence
linked
to
the
numbers
betting
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial,
this
only
on
the
numbers
theory.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
a
retrial
on
the
numbers
theory
of
liability
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
court
erred
in
concluding
that
the
district
court
dismissed
the
discrete
theory
of
liability.
the
district
court
actually
entered
the
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
entire
single
count
charge
because
it
found
that
the
government
had
just
not
shown
that
petitioner
was
connected
with
gambling
business.
moreover
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
the
district
court
only
dismissed
the
numbers
theory,
petitioner's
acquittal
barred
the
retrial.
he
was
charged
with
participation
in
a
single
gambling
business
and
was
acquitted
of
participating
in
that
gambling
business.
the
government
may
not
again
attempt
to
show
through
a
different
theory
that
petitioners
participated
in
the
same
gambling
business,
during
the
same
time
period
involved
in
the
first
trial.
even
though
the
trial
court's
ruling
on
the
evidentiary
question
was
found
to
be
erroneous,
once
a
defendant
is
acquitted
of
an
offense,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
absolutely
bars
a
second
trial
on
that
offense.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
white
joins
only
in
parts
i,
ii-a
and
iii
of
this
opinion
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined.
