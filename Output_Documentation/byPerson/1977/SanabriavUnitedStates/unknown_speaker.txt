implied
counts?
unknown
speaker
what
is
a
dbl?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
going
to
recognize
dbl,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dimento,
as
i
understand
that
law
that
is
subsequently
developed,
had
the
judge
made
a
different
ruling
on
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence,
your
client
could
have
been
convicted
in
this
trial
on
the
numbers
evidence.
unknown
speaker
so
he
was
in
jeopardy
of
conviction
on
both
dbls.
unknown
speaker
although
the
indictment
could
have
charged
the
crime,
that
the
evidence
would
have
supported
it.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
indictment
adequately
charged
a
crime
to
which
this
evidence
was
relevant.
unknown
speaker
but,
nevertheless,
when
he
entered
what
you
call
a
judgment
of
acquittal
he
had
already
ruled
that
the
indictment
did
not
charge
a
crime
with
respect
to
numbers.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not
and
i
do
not
blame
you.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
the
indictment
as
it
stood
charged
a
crime
to
which
the
evidence
about
numbers
was
relevant.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
at
the
trial
had
said
“there
is
no
crime
charged
in
the
indictment
to
which
this
evidence
is
relevant.”
so,
how
could
he
have
ever
had
acquitted
him
on
that
crime
which
was
never
charged?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
about
that.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
ask
about
exclusions
of
evidence
with
respect
to
crimes
that,
unquestionably,
is
charged
in
the
indictment.
unknown
speaker
it
was
excluded
as
irrelevant
to
the
crime
that
the
judge
did
think
the
indictment
charge.
it
was
not
excluded
as
irrelevant
to
the
charge
which
he
thought
the
indictment
did
not
charge.
unknown
speaker
i
certainly
am.
i
intend
to.
unknown
speaker
on
what?
unknown
speaker
why
was
there
defect
on
the
face
of
the
indictment?
the
indictment
was
perfectly
valid
facially.
they
charged
him
with
the
violation
of
this
federal
statute
and
the
state
criminal
law
they
mentioned
was
the
one
covering
horse-race
betting.
that
was
not
a
defective
indictment
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
there
might
or
might
not
have
been
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
him
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
insufficient
relevant
evidence
to
convict
him.
you
do
not
make
a
motion
before
trial
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
in
dinitz,
the
defendant
asked
for
a
mistrial.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
quite
different
from
asking
and
getting
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
on
that
last
point,
supposing
as
you
suggest
and
was
suggested
this
morning,
the
defendant
had
not
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal
but
had
asked
for
instructions
which
would
have
really,
in
fairness,
mandate
an
acquittal
by
the
jury
and
the
jury
had,
nevertheless,
found
him
guilty.
then,
i
suppose,
under
the
theory
of
the
case
that
the
trial
judge
actually
adapted,
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
obligated
to
grant
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
acquittal
and
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
had
that
scenario
taken
place,
would
you
contend
that
such
an
order
by
the
trial
judge
would
also
have
been
a
dismissal?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
even
if
there
were
a
jury
verdict
of
acquittal
that
because
of
the
erroneous
exclusion
of
the
evidence
that
it
should
be
treated
as
though
the
indictment
had
been
dismissed
on
this
dbl.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
ruled
expressly
that
the
indictment
did
not
reach
in
the
numbers
of
the
charge.
unknown
speaker
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
because
i
may
be
because
there
has
been
so
much
double
jeopardy
recently.
did
the
martin
linen
case
not,
in
effect,
hold
that
the
grant
of
a
motion
for
an
acquittal
was
the
equivalent
of
a
jury
verdict
of
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
how
you
can
have
an
acquittal
of
part
of
a
count.
but,
i
know
that
is
what
this
whole
case
involves.
