justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
point
was
that
since
the
indictment
had
not
recited
in
detail
each
of
the
massachusetts
statute
that
was
thought
to
be
violated,
and
a
necessary
prerequisite
for
the
federal
offense,
this
motion
was
in
order.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
particularized,
do
you
mean
alleged
in
the
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
your
view
that
the
indictment
to
be
sufficient
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss
had
to
allege
chapter
and
verse
of
the
massachusetts
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
misleading
contention
on
your
part
that
since
they
did
not
have
to
specify
anything
but
they
did
specify
one
section
and,
therefore,
you
have
been
more
or
less
misled
so
that
you
were
prepared
to
defend
only
as
to
that
aspect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
move,
you
in
effect,
waived
your
right
to
have
the
jury
return
that
verdict.
you
chose
to
have
a
determination
in
a
different
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
so
far
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protection
though
one
of
them
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
jury
that
is
empaneled
and
have
your
determination
come
from
that
first
jury,
do
you
not
think
when
you
make
a
motion
like
you
do,
you
waive
that
right
in
favor
of
some
preferred
method
of
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
willing
to
let
them
arrive
at.
you
wanted
it
short-circuited.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
were
not
because
you
made
the
motion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happens
at
that
stage
of
the
trial?
supposing
you
do
not
have
the
dbl
element
in
it
at
all,
there
is
simply
an
indictment
for
a
bank
robbery
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
government’s
case
the
trial
judge
says
“i
am
going
to
exclude
all
evidence
of
bank
robbery.”
what
is
the
next
step
that
either
of
the
parties
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
face
it.
we
have
got
a
whole
bunch
of
judges
around
the
country
and
my
hypothetical
is
that
he
may
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
indictment
or
perhaps
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
indictment.
and
then,
he
says
“i
am
going
to
exclude
any
evidence
of
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
it
is
a
poor
ruling
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
but
what
does
defense
counsel
do
at
this
stage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
is
simply
sitting
there
with
no
move
to
make.
what
happens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
a
question
of
your
waiving
a
right
to
double
jeopardy.
it
is
a
question
of
consciously
deciding
not
to
go
to
this
particular
jury
for
its
verdict.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
did
make
a
choice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
on
account
of
a
counter
practice
would
have
subjected
your
client
to
a
risk
too.
as
you
say,
the
jury
might
have
come
back
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
you
have
had
more
than
six
months
of
experience.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wait.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
you
do
not
have
to
show
prejudice.
it
is
another
to
say
you
have
not
been
prejudiced.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
on
your
theory,
would
there
ever
be
a
case
of
no
double
jeopardy
in
the
case
of
a
count
of
indictment
submitted
to
a
jury
by
the
judge
and
with
respect
to
which
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
not
guilty?
