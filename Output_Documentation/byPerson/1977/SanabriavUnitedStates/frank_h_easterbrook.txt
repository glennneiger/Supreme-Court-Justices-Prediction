mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
distinctive
and
simple.
since
mr.
dimento’s
argument
is
concentrated
on
the
fact,
i
think
i
will
do
likewise
at
least
for
a
few
minutes
before
lunch.
the
indictment
which
was
filed
in
1972
charged
petitioner
and
16
others
with
operating
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise
in
violation
of
state
law.
the
indictment
on
its
face
stated,
and
this
language
appears
at
page
16a
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
the
defendants
accepted
“bets
and
wagers
on
a
para-mutual
numbers
pool.”
it
also
charged
that
the
gambling
enterprise
accepted
bets
on
horse
races.
in
other
words,
it
charged
that
one
crime
was
committed
by
two
means.
after
three
years
of
pretrial
proceedings
and
on
the
sixth
day
of
trial
after
the
close
of
the
government’s
case,
the
defendants
moved
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
judge
rejected
that
motion
out
of
hand
is
frivolous.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
lunch,
i
had
read
part
of
the
charging
portion
of
the
indictment
which
said
that
defendants,
as
part
of
the
operation
of
a
gambling
enterprise,
accepted
bets
and
wagers
on
a
para-mutual
number
pool.
after
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
the
defendants
then
argued
that
the
indictment
failed
to
state
any
offense
involving
numbers
betting,
although
it
clearly
did
so,
on
its
face,
because
it
referred
to
section
17
of
a
particular
massachusetts
statute.
this
section,
they
argued,
referred
mainly
to
horse
betting
and
that
section
7
referred
to
numbers
betting.
after
the
district
court
initially
denied
this
motion,
it
agreed
and
concluded
that
the
indictment
did
not
adequately
charge
any
offense
involving
the
taking
of
numbers
bets.
having
effectively
struck
through
with
the
charge
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
charging
numbers
bets,
the
district
court
then
excluded
the
numbers
evidence
as
irrelevant
to
what
remained.
the
trial
was
recessed
overnight
and
the
prosecutor
asked
the
district
court
to
reconsider
that
decision.
the
district
court
asked
counsel
for
petitioner
whether
he
was
prejudiced.
counsel
said
in
open
court
that,
indeed,
there
was
no
prejudice
because
he
had
read
the
indictment
and
seen
the
charge
of
accepting
numbers
bets.
he
asserted,
however,
that
he
did
not
need
to
show
prejudice
because
this
was
a
technical
matter.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
so.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
concluding
that
you
did
not
have
to,
that
you
had
to
show
prejudice.
but
in
a
minimum,
having
conceded
that
there
was
not
any,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
who
had
the
burden
to
show
prejudice.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
formal
waiver
of
any
sort.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
not
relied
on
it
as
a
waiver,
your
honor.
it
is
simply
a
statement
that
there
was
not,
in
fact,
any
prejudice.
i
would
take
it
as
a
concession,
as
mr.
dimento
said
in
open
court
today
that
he
was
making
a
specious
motion.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
adhered
to
its
ruling
and
concluded
that
the
indictment
would
not
be
read
as
stating
any
offense
involving
numbers.
with
the
numbers
theory
removed,
the
district
court
then
turned
to
the
evidence
with
respect
to
horse
betting.
it
found
that
this
evidence
was
insufficient
to
show
that
mr.
sanabria
was
involved
in
the
gambling
enterprise
and
it
acquitted
him
on
what
remained.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
dismissing
the
indictment
in
so
far
as
it
charged
engagement
in
accepting
numbers
bets.
it
further
held
that
the
district
court’s
disposition
of
the
numbers
betting
portion
of
the
indictment
was
not
an
acquittal
because
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
relating
the
evidence
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
or
to
the
defining
the
elements
of
the
offense,
but
was
simply
a
conclusion
that
the
indictment
was
insufficient
on
its
face.
the
court
then
remanded
for
a
second
trial
with
respect
to
the
gambling
offense
to
the
extent
to
the
gambling
offense
involving
numbers.
to
the
extent
involving
horse
betting,
there
was
indeed
an
acquittal.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
we
agree,
that
we
could
not
retry
petitioner
on
that
charge.
petitioners
argued
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
does
not
authorize
the
appeal
that
the
united
states
took.
this
court
has
held,
however,
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
authorizes
any
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
unless
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
the
way.
we
believe,
therefore,
that
the
only
question
this
court
need
confront
is
a
constitutional
one.
i
turn
directly
to
that.
we
believe
that
a
second
trial
on
the
horse
betting
theory
is
permissible
for
two
reasons.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
on
the
numbers
theory,
i
am
sorry.
first,
a
defendant
who
has
an
opportunity
before
trial
to
seek
a
resolution
of
defects
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
must
do
so
then.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
but
i
meant
that
contention
in
another
way.
the
indictment
on
its
face
charged
the
taking
of
numbers
bets,
and
then
it
referred
to
a
state
statute.
petitioner
argued
that
the
indictment
would
have
been
adequate
to
charge
the
taking
of
numbers
bets,
if
it
had
either
recited
section
7
of
the
massachusetts
statute
or
not
mentioned
any
massachusetts
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
just
said
in
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
but,
the
elements
of
the
offense
had
to
do
with
the
statement
that
it
violated
state
law.
in
order
to
be
a
sufficient
charge,
the
numbers
bets
were
involved.
to
the
extent
that
numbers
bets
were
not
adequately
charged
then,
the
claim
is
that
something
went
wrong
on
the
face
of
that
indictment,
that
although
the
language
of
the
indictment
said
that
numbers
bets
were
being
taken
and
that
this
was
a
gambling
offense,
the
statement
that
section
17
of
the
massachusetts
statute
was
involved
with
enough
to
affect
the
validity
of
that
charge
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
indictment.
it
would
have
been
open
to
petitioner
then
to
move
before
trial
to
strike
through
that
language
as
incorrect
or
inconsistent
or,
in
some
other
way,
inadequate.
our
argument
is
that
since
he
did
not
do
so,
he
then
opened
up
the
possibility
of
a
second
trial
that
would
otherwise
not
have
needed
to
be
held.
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
the
second
argument
which
was
an
alternative
argument
is
that
the
district
court’s
decision
here
removed
the
numbers
charged
from
the
case
of
petitioner’s
request.
when
the
district
judge
granted
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
all
that
was
left
was
horse
betting.
the
case,
therefore,
is
not
significantly
different
from
last
term’s
decision
in
lee
which
held
that
a
defendant
could
be
retried
after
an
indictment
had
been
dismissed
in
mid-trial
at
the
defendants’
request.
the
first
argument
has
to
do
with
the
timing
of
petitioner’s
motion.
rule
12b3
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
requires
that
objections
to
defects
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
be
raised
before
trial.
the
argument
that
the
indictment
which
concededly
recited
that
petitioner
engaged
in
a
betting
offense
involving
numbers
did
not
actually
charge
that
offense.
it
is
an
attack
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
indictment
and,
therefore,
was
required
to
be
raised
before
trial.
we
have
collected
at
note
23
of
our
brief
some
authorities
that
support
this
proposition.
petitioner,
therefore,
was
not
entitled
to
have
his
contention
resolved
during
trial
at
all.
not
having
attacked
the
indictment
before
trial,
the
judge
was
required
to
treat
the
charge
as
sufficient.
the
court
did
consider.
in
considering
it
at
all
that
it
erred
in
petitioner’s
favor,
the
timing
of
the
motion
was
petitioner’s
choice
and
the
judge
did
reach
it.
it
gave
him
the
relief
he
requested.
in
doing
so
it
erred
a
second
time,
as
the
court
of
appeals
now
has
held.
in
other
words,
this
case
is
here
because
of
a
result
of
two
errors
that
the
district
court
made,
each
induced
by
petitioner.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
distinctions
between
fong
foo
and
this
case.
one
of
which,
the
technical
question
whether
this
was
indeed
an
acquittal
i
will
get
to
in
the
second
part
of
this
argument.
the
more
important
distinction
between
this
case
and
fong
foo,
one
that
is
pertinent
to
the
argument
i
am
making
now
is
that,
in
but
in
fong
foo,
the
things
that
led
to
the
determination
of
the
prosecution
could
not
have
been
raised
before
trial.
the
question
whether
a
prosecution’s
witness
was
lying,
whether
the
evidence
was
believable,
whether
it
was
sufficient,
and
the
other
things
that
underlay
the
district
court’s
decision
in
fong
foo
were
capable
of
resolution
only
at
a
trial
with
the
general
issue.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
third
issue.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
third
difference,
i
am
sorry,
is
that
the
defendants
in
fong
foo
did
not
ask
the
district
court
to
do
what
he
did.
they
did
not,
in
other
words,
request
the
termination
of
the
trial
before
the
jury
had
a
chance
to
rule
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
that
is
one
reason,
why
fong
foo
was
quite
different
from
cases
like
lee
and,
indeed,
from
cases
like
dinitz
in
which
the
defendant,
on
his
own
motion,
took
the
case
away
from
the
jury
and
asked
for
a
pre-verdict
termination.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
agree.
in
lee,
the
defendant
moved
for
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
the
equivalent
of
mistrial.
i
think
it
is
also
the
case
that
if
what
the
defendant
asks
for
and
gets
is
really
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
that
the
same
analysis
applies
regardless
of
what
the
district
court
calls
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
will.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first,
your
hypothetical
case
is
a
case
that
this
court
has
already
decided.
it
is
the
case
of
foreman
against
the
united
states.
in
361
us,
the
court
held
that
a
second
trial
was
permissible
in
that
case
because
the
jury
did
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
the
teeth
of
the
evidence,
as
the
judge
defined
it,
because
the
judge
wrongly
removed
from
the
jury’s
consideration,
the
correct
theory
on
which
it
could
and
should
have
convicted.
the
second
answer
is
that
if
that
kind
of
thing
had
happened
in
this
case
and
the
jury
had
in
fact
acquitted
instead
of
convicting,
that
it
would
not
have
been
an
acquittal
on
the
charge
to
the
extent
it
involved
numbers
evidence.
our
view
is
that
the
numbers
charge
was
removed
from
the
case
well
before
the
judge
granted
an
acquittal.
when
the
judge
effectively
said
that
there
was
no
numbers
charge
at
all
because
the
indictment
was
inadequately
stated,
that
took
the
case
out.
what
was
left
was
a
horse
betting
charge.
whether
the
district
judge
acquitted
it,
acquitted
by
himself
or
sent
it
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal
is,
in
our
view,
a
matter
of
detail.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
would
dispute,
i
think,
whether
you
would
characterize
this
as
an
erroneous
exclusion
of
evidence.
it
is
clear
that
evidence
was
taken
out
of
the
case,
but
it
is
also
i
think
clear
that
more
than
that
was
involved.
before
the
evidence
went
out,
there
was
a
ruling
that
the
indictment
was
insufficient
to
state
that
part
of
the
offense.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
on
page
16a
of
the
petitioner
for
certiorari.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
suppose
the
case
had
been
identical
to
the
facts
in
lee
in
which
the
defendant
was
charged
with
taking
the
wallet
of
a
blind
operator
of
a
candy
stand
at
the
post
office.
the
judge
had
concluded
after
hearing
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
indictment
was
insufficient
to
state
an
offense
because
it
did
not
charge
that
the
defendant
intended
permanently
to
deprive
mr.
bilsky,
his
property,
having
said
that,
the
judge
then
formally
excluded
the
evidence.
in
our
view,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
what
the
judge
said
nor
did
having
concluded
that
the
indictment
was
insufficient
on
its
face
to
charge
that
offense.
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
detail.
the
defendants’
interests
were
fixed
by
the
reason
that
the
judge
terminated
the
case
and
not
the
means
by
which
he
did
so.
that,
i
think,
is
the
rationale
underlying
the
distinction
between
dismissals
of
the
indictment
and
mistrials
on
one
hand
and
true
acquittals
on
the
other.
it
has
to
do
with
the
reason
why
the
case
terminated
and
not
the
form
that
the
judge
used
to
make
that
termination
come
about.
the
reason
this
case
terminated
with
respect
to
the
numbers
offense
was
simply
that
the
defendant
succeeded
in
persuading
the
court
that
the
indictment
was
bad
on
its
face.
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
avoid
multiple
trials
at
the
request
of
the
prosecution.
it
guards
against
repeated
prosecutions
brought
to
embarrass
the
defendant,
to
subject
him
to
anxiety,
to
increase
the
chance
of
conviction
of
an
innocent
man.
but,
the
premise
of
this
rule
is
that
it
is
possible
to
have
guilt
reliably
determined
in
a
single
trial.
when
guilt
can
be
determined
in
a
single
trial,
holding
of
two
trials
is
pointless
and
an
offense
against
the
defendants’
rights.
but,
when
the
premise
of
this
rule
does
not
hold
true,
the
court
has
allowed
second
trials
in
order
to
produce
a
single
fair
trial.
for
example,
there
can
be
a
second
trial
after
a
tainted
conviction
has
been
reversed.
there
can
be
another
trial
after
a
mistrial
has
been
granted
because
of
manifest
necessity
or
even
in
the
absence
of
manifest
necessity
because
the
defendant
requested
it.
there
can
be
another
trial
as
in
lee,
when
an
indictment
has
been
dismissed
at
the
defendants’
request
because
of
a
defect
on
its
face.
in
other
words,
when
the
first
trial
is
flawed,
a
second
trial
may
be
held.
when
a
defendant
moves
to
abort
his
case
before
a
verdict,
a
second
trial
may
be
held
even
if
the
first
one
was
not
flawed.
in
these
cases,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
prosecutor
deprived
the
defendant
of
his
valued
right
to
obtain
the
verdict
of
the
jury
at
his
first
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
taking
that
position.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
lee
was
a
bench
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
it
had
actually
gone
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
in
our
view,
there
could
be
no
review.
that
would
be
the
end
of
things.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
of
the
difficulties
in
reviewing
judgments
of
acquittal
has
been
that
judgments
of
acquittal
could
be
based
upon
other
reasons.
the
judge
may
make
an
erroneous
instruction
but
the
jury
might
acquit
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
erroneous
instruction.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
even
necessarily
irrationality,
simply
disbelief
of
the
proof
which
might
be
rational
or
irrational
on
a
particular
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
to
the
extent
it
could
be
reduced
to
simply
a
claim
of
jury
irrationality
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
jury
irrationality.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
reason,
i
said
that,
was
because,
in
our
view,
what
the
jury
would
have
acquitted
on
was
only
the
offense
to
the
extent
it
involved
numbers.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
perhaps
i
am
not
entirely
understanding
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
stevens.
in
your
hypothetical,
would
the
judge
submit
the
entire
indictment
together
with
the
charge
of
both
numbers
and
horse
betting?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view,
the
numbers
issue
would
still
be
a
lie
because
the
numbers
issue
never
went
to
the
jury
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
confusing
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
he
submits
both
theories
to
the
jury,
then
i
think
the
jury’s
acquittal
is
final.
but,
if
he
takes
out
of
the
case
before
it
goes
to
the
jury,
a
discrete
basis
for
the
imposition
of
liability.
here,
the
numbers
offense.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
did.
it
was
not
simply
a
jury
charge
issue.
it
was
a
case
in
which
a
discrete
sequence
of
events.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
the
numbers
charge
would
never
go
to
the
jury
with
or
without
any
evidence
at
all.
the
jury
would
be
told
that
the
indictment
never
charged
any
numbers
offense
and
that
he
should
disregard
the
language.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
i
still
give
you
the
same
answer
that
since
the
numbers
charge
was
gone
from
the
case
by
then.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
perhaps
how
you
come
out
of
this
depends
in
part
on
where
you
go
in.
in
our
view,
it
was
not
gone
because
he
excluded
the
evidence.
he
excluded
the
evidence
because
it
was
gone.
the
evidence
was
quite
irrelevant
to
the
case
once
he
had
held
there
was
no
valid
numbers
charge
at
all
on
the
face
of
this
indictment.
the
evidence
was
excluded
because
of
what
had
gone
before
that
and
because
of
a
legal
theory
that
did
not
have
much
to
do
with
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
or,
indeed,
with
the
relevance
of
the
evidence
but
had
to
do
with
the
adequacy
of
the
indictment.
i
think
that
is
the
key
in
the
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
he
was,
in
fact,
put
in
jeopardy.
the
jeopardy
was
terminated
at
his
own
requested
by
the
effective
dismissal
of
the
indictment
here,
as
in
lee.
in
lee
too,
although
the
information
was
defective
with
jeopardy
attached
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
would
always
be
a
double
jeopardy
bar
to
a
second
trial
on
the
charge
submitted
to
the
jury.
there
are
no
exceptions
to
that
in
our
view.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
did
not
follow
the
hypothetical.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
the
conviction
in
those
circumstances
would
be
in
the
teeth
of
the
evidence
and
would
have
to
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
or
set
aside
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
has
happened.
the
foreman
case
is
one
of
those
examples.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
he
was.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
the
same
answer
that
i
had
given
to
justice
stevens,
that
by
the
time
we
got
there,
the
numbers
offense
had
been
taken
out
of
the
case
entirely
and
what
would
remain
to
go
to
the
jury
and,
indeed,
what
remained
on
which
the
district
judge
here
entered
his
judgment
of
acquittal,
had
nothing
to
do
with
numbers
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
would
have
had
to
instruct
the
jury
that
there
is
no
way
to
convict
this
man
on
the
charge
that
remains.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
the
motion
that
in
our
view
is
the
material
one
was
not
the
motion
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
was
the
motion
to
take
the
numbers
theory
out
of
the
case.
once
that
had
been
done,
the
acquittal
followed
quite
naturally.
but,
the
dispositive
point
in
our
view
is
the
time
at
which
the
numbers
theory
came
out.
let
me
suggest
an
analogy
that
we
use
in
our
brief.
suppose
this
indictment
had
been
in
two
counts,
and
we
understand
the
petitioner
does
not
contest
that
it
could
have
been.
one
count
charging
conducting
a
gambling
enterprise
by
taking
horse
bets.
the
other
count
charging
the
conduct
of
the
gambling
enterprise
by
taking
numbers
bets.
the
district
judge
would
have
done
two
discrete
things
here.
he
would
have
charged
that
the
first
count
of
the
indictment
charging
the
taking
of
numbers
bets
was
insufficient
on
its
face
and
dismissed
it.
then
he
would
have
submitted
a
second
count
to
the
jury,
the
second
count
dealing
with
the
taking
of
numbers
bets.
the
jury
would
have
acquitted
on
that.
in
our
view,
this
is
the
same
case
as
that
hypothetical.
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
defendants
as
far
as
double
jeopardy
interests
are
concerned,
whether
there
was
one
count
or
two.
although
in
our
view
once
the
horse
betting
count
went
to
the
jury,
that
is
a
final
un-reviewable
disposition
of
the
numbers
argument,
it
does
not
do
anything
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
prosecutor
has
substantial
discretion
in
drafting
an
indictment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
certainly
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
agreed
at
least
between
the
parties
here
that
a
two-count
indictment
in
this
case
would
have
been
proper.
i
think,
in
so
far
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
concerned,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
in
one
count
or
two.
in
greene
against
the
united
states,
at
555
us
page
190
note
10,
the
court
took
up
exactly
this
kind
of
question.
the
question
in
greene
was
whether
it
made
a
difference
in
part
that
first
and
second
degree
murder
had
been
expressed
in
one
count
rather
than
two.
the
court
said
the
situation
is
the
same
as
though
greene
had
been
charged
with
these
different
offenses
in
separate
but
alternative
counts
of
the
indictment.
the
constitutional
issues
at
stake
here
should
not
turn
on
the
fact
that
both
offenses
were
charged
to
the
jury
under
one
count.
the
same
is
true
in
this
case.
the
constitutional
issue
should
not
turn
on
the
fact
that
both
theories
of
liability
were
charged
in
one
count.
the
interests
of
the
defendant
are
the
same
either
way.
the
issue
on
which
the
district
judge
eventually
entered
its
judgment
of
acquittal
had
only
to
do
with
the
numbers
betting
theory
of
liability,
excuse
me,
it
had
only
to
do
with
the
horse
betting
and
not
numbers
betting.
if
i
make
that
mistake
once
more,
it
is
going
to
be
exceedingly
embarrassing.
i
repeat
that
the
problems
here
are
largely
of
petitioner’s
making.
there
was
no
fatal
flaw
in
the
indictment.
the
first
trial
was
not
infected
with
error.
the
petitioner
took
a
perfectly
adequate
trial,
brought
it
to
a
halt,
persuaded
the
judge
that
he
had
not
been
adequately
charged,
and
aborted
the
trial
without
obtaining
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
all
of
this
was
unnecessary.
the
timing
was
petitioner’s
choice.
the
error
was
introduced
at
petitioner’s
urging.
we,
therefore,
believe
that
because
he
urged
the
district
court
twice,
once
in
timing
and
once
in
taking
the
numbers
offense
out
of
the
case,
he
should
not
now
be
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
from
prosecution.
we,
therefore,
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
petitioner’s
second
trial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
we
do
not
contest
that
holding
here,
although
i
argued
it
in
martin
linen
case
in
the
other
side.
but,
the
gist
of
my
argument
has
been
that
two
things
happened
here.
one,
with
respect
to
the
horse
betting
theory
of
liability,
it
ended
in
a
true
judgment
of
acquittal
although
entered
by
the
judge.
it
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
by
the
jury
and
we
cannot
retry
mr.
sanabria
on
horse
betting.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
for
the
same
reason,
i
think
that
you
could
have
an
acquittal
on
count
one
of
a
two-count
indictment
if
this
charge
have
been
broken
up
in
two
counts,
as
it
could
have
been.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
does
and
it
depends
on
characterizing
what
the
district
judge
did
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
it.
but,
we
think
the
reading
is
correct
and
the
characterization
is
fair,
and
the
rest
of
the
argument
is
downhill
from
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am.
i
think
it
was
an
alternative
ground
for
the
decision
and
it
must
be
seen
as
a
holding.
