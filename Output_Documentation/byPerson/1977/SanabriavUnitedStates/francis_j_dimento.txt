mr.
francis
j.
dimento
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
here
on
the
grant
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
which
partially
vacated
a
judgment
of
acquittal
entered
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
case
presents
a
double
jeopardy
issue
which
arises
in
this
way.
in
november
of
1971,
there
were
a
series
of
raids
so-called
around
the
suburban
communities
of
boston,
pursuant
to
search
warrants
directed
to
suspected
bookmaking
establishments.
the
warrants
were
issued
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
wiretaps
authorized
by
the
district
court
which
have
been
conducted
since
the
previous
june.
for
some
reason,
and
i
do
not
know
the
reason,
it
was
not
until
10
months
later
in
september
1972
that
an
indictment
was
returned.
in
this
particular
indictment,
the
one
now
before
you,
16
persons
were
indicted
and,
eventually,
11
were
tried
of
whom
one
was
the
petitioner,
sanabria.
it
was
a
one-count
indictment
charging
a
violation
of
title
18
united
states
code
section
1955
which,
as
you
know,
is
the
so-called
bookie
syndicate
act.
about
a
month
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
the
fourth
circuit
announced
this
decision
in
giordano
which
you
might
recall
was
the
case
that
held
that
a
wiretap
was
invalid
if
its
application
for
it
had
been
authorized
by
a
person
other
than
the
attorney
general
or
the
specially
designated
assistant
as
required
by
the
statute.
then,
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
giordano.
in
the
spring
of
1973,
by
agreement
among
all
the
parties
including
the
government
and
the
defendants,
the
case
was
allowed
to
lay
dormant
pending
your
decision
in
giordano.
i
give
you
this
history
because
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
government’s
brief
and
in
the
record
that,
for
three
or
four
or
five
years,
defense
counsel
was
finding
ways
to
attack
the
indictment.
the
case
was
essentially
dormant
for
a
very
good
part
of
the
time.
eventually,
in
mid-1974
i
believe,
this
court
upheld
giordano.
as
a
result,
many,
many
of
the
indictments
that
have
resulted
from
the
raids
were
dismissed
and
this
was
one
of
the
few
surviving
indictments,
if
not
the
only
one.
it
became
immediately
apparent
to
defense
counsel
that
unless
we
could
find
some
other
basis
for
a
fourth
amendment
attack,
there
was
simply
no
defense
for
these
defendants.
there
was
just
a
ton
of
evidence,
if
all
the
bookmaking
slips
and
wiretaps
were
going
to
get
into
evidence.
we
did
come
up
with
some
other
fourth
amendment
grounds
but
the
district
court
did
not
see
it
that
way,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals.
interestingly
enough,
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
which
was
held
by
you
over
the
summer
and
denied
just
last
september
under
the
name
of
plotkin,
petitioner,
i
believe
against
the
united
states.
these
were
the
10
defendants
who
were
convicted.
sanabria
was
the
11th
and
he
was
acquitted.
i
am
jumping
ahead
in
time.
after
the
trial
court
denied
our
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence,
we
realized
that
the
trial
was
going
to
be
simply
an
exercise
in
the
protection
of
the
defendants’
rights.
shortly
before
the
trial
began,
we
began
casting
around
for
some
kind
of
defense
to
put
on
some
kind
of
plausible
defense
at
the
trial.
of
course,
the
place
to
begin
is
with
the
statute.
the
statute,
if
you
recall,
prohibits
willfully
conducting
a
gambling
business
that
has
to
meet
three
criteria.
first
of
all,
the
violation
of
the
gambling
business
must
constitute
a
violation
of
state
law.
second,
it
must
involve
five
or
more
persons.
thirdly,
it
must
be
large.
it
must
be
in
operation
more
than
30
days
or
receive
a
gross
revenue
of
more
than
$2,000
in
any
single
day.
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
was
to
prove
that
the
gambling
law
alleged
in
the
indictment
violated
state
law.
the
indictment
particularized
as
the
violation
of
state
law,
section
17
of
chapter
271.
that
section
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws
is
directed
to
games
like
horse
races,
political
election,
boxing
matches,
but
not
to
lottery,
the
numbers
games
so-called.
thus,
the
government
had
to
prove
or
we
thought
they
had
to
prove
that
the
business
that
was
being
alleged
was
one
that
was
in
violation
of
section
17.
that
is
a
non-numbers
type
of
game.
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case
when
it
put
section
17
into
evidence,
by
way
of
asking
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
we
made
what
i
might
charitably
call
a
somewhat
specious
argument.
because
the
indictment
described
the
business
as
one
of
registering
bets
which
is
not,
technically
speaking,
a
crime
under
massachusetts
law,
the
crime
is
being
found
in
a
place
with
apparatus
for
registering
bets.
but,
because
the
indictment
described
the
business
as
one
for
registering
bets
and
because
it
described
the
gambling
business
as
including
a
numbers
operation
and
the
numbers
operation
was
not
a
crime
under
section
17
which
was
specified
in
the
indictment,
we
moved
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
as
i
say,
the
motion
was
completely
unsound.
we
took
a
wild
shot
and
the
district
court
was
not
buying
it.
at
the
appendix
at
page
7,
you
will
find
the
district
court
holding
that
the
indictment
was
not
effective
in
denying
the
judgment
of
acquittal
on
that
basis.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
know.
i
never
dreamed
that
this
case
would
get
this
far
or
that
there
would
be
any
double
jeopardy
plan.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
made
a
specious
argument
moving
for
judgment
of
acquittal
when
the
proper
motion
should
have
been
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
that
was
why
the
argument
was
not
well-founded.
then
after
the
district
court
denied
the
motion,
properly
so,
we
got
down
to
the
serious
business
of
directing
ourselves
to
the
evidence
in
the
case.
we
moved
at
page
11,
i
believe
of
the
record,
to
strike
or
limit
the
numbers
evidence
so
as
not
to
be
considered
on
the
first
essential
element
of
the
crime.
that
is,
that
the
gambling
business
must
violate
state
law
and,
in
this
case,
violate
section
17,
the
horse-racing
statute.
what
we
were
asking
the
court
to
do
is
either
strike
out
all
of
the
numbers
because
horse-racing
had
been
particularized
or
limit
the
numbers
evidence
so
that
it
could
be
received
only
as
further
description
of
the
gambling
and
perhaps
go
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendants.
that
is,
that
they
were
professional
gamblers
and
knew
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
not
quite,
your
honor.
my
point
was
there
was
one
statute
which
was
particularized
and
that
was
the
statue,
the
violation
of
which
the
government
had
to
prove.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
particularly
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
no,
not
that
either.
judge
skinner,
the
trial
judge,
recognized
that.
if
it
had
simply
alleged
that
the
gambling
business
violated
state
law
that
would
have
been
enough.
i
think
judge
skinner
said
that
what
the
government
had
done
was
narrowed
it,
specified
section
17,
and
was
stuck
with
it.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
really
did
not
think
i
had
to
show
that
i
was
misled
or
prejudiced
because
it
is
part
of
the
due
process
that
you
prove
what
is
charged
and
you
charge
what
you
intend
to
prove.
i
suppose
that
is
part
of
it.
but,
it
all
goes
to
the
fundamental
right
to
be
notified
of
the
crime
with
which
you
were
charged.
at
any
rate,
the
district
court
denied
our
motion
to
strike
the
evidence
so
as
to
limit
it
and
then
the
defendants
put
on
some
evidence
and
then
we
renewed
what
i
would
call
a
specious
judgment
of
acquittal
motion
and
that
was
denied.
then,
there
was
a
recess
and
the
judge
came
back
from
the
recess
and
said
that
he
had
done
some
research.
he
reconsidered
our
motion
to
strike
or
any
alternative
to
limit
the
evidence
and
he
decided
to
strike
the
numbers
evidence.
he
says
that
in
page
13,
“section
17
does
not
include
the
numbers
aspect,
so
that
while
i
am
not
going
to
grant
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
that
basis,
i
will
grant
the
motion
to
strike
so
much
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
as
has
to
do
with
numbers
betting.”
then,
when
the
dust
had
cleared
and
the
numbers
evidence
had
all
been
taken
out
of
the
case
it
became
obvious
that
there
was
no
evidence
linking
one
defendant
to
the
case
in
any
way,
linking
him
to
the
gambling
business
and
that
defendant
was
the
petitioner
here,
sanabria.
i
did
what
i
assumed
was
the
logical
thing
to
do
and
move
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
of
course,
what
we
could
have
done
was
to
do
nothing
at
all
and
permit
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
which
it
would
have
had
to
do
because
the
judge
would
have
had
to
instruct
that
they
could
convict
somebody
only
if
he
were
connected
to
a
horse-racing
gambling
business
and
the
jury
would
have,
under
those
instructions,
done
the
right
thing,
i
assume.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
thought
that
that
question
could
have
been
passed
in
the
martin
linen
case
decided
only
last
april
where
this
court
recognizes
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
is
the
equivalent
of
a
directed
verdict
and,
i
would
assume,
of
a
verdict.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
think
of
it
as
a
waiver.
i
think
of
it
as
saving
the
court,
the
government,
defense
counsel,
and
all
the
personnel
involved
in
the
trial
a
lot
of
time.
why
go
through
the
empty
and
futile
gesture,
to
go
through
this
empty
ritual
of
sending
the
case
to
the
jury
when
you
know
there
is
only
one
conclusion
that
they
can
arrive
at?
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
would
have
been
willing.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
because
i
was
following
the
rules.
i
am
sure
if
i
had,
by
way
of
request
for
instruction,
asked
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
are
not
to
convict
anybody
who
was
shown
merely
to
be
who
was
not
in
the
horse
business,
he
would
have,
when
i
made
that
request
for
instructions,
said
to
me
“you
damn
fool!why
are
you
not
moving
for
judgment
of
acquittal?
i
am
not
going
to
send
this
case
and
sit
around
until
a
jury
decides
up
there
in
the
jury
room
that
there
is
no
evidence.”
he
would
have,
i
suppose,
sue
sponte
entered
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
i
do
not
think
of
myself
as
waiving
anything.
the
judgment
of
acquittal
was
allowed
and
then
the
government
filed
this
notice
of
appeal.
i
would
say
the
notice
of
appeal
of
the
first
circuit
is
the
first
time
and
the
only
time
the
government
correctly
described
what
happened,
because
it
says
the
united
states
appeals
from
a
decision
in
order
of
the
district
court
excluding
evidence
and
entering
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
denying
the
motion
for
reconsideration.
there
had
been
a
motion
for
reconsideration
thereafter.
then
in
the
second
paragraph
of
its
notice
of
appeal,
the
government
says
it
is
hereby
certified
that
the
evidence
suppressed
constitutes
the
substantial
proof
of
the
charges
against
the
defendant.
obviously,
the
government
was
trying
to
fit
this
in
to
that
part
of
the
statute
which
permits
it
to
appeal
from
an
allowance
of
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
the
net
result
really
as
to
what
happened
here
was
that
there
was
an
erroneous
ruling
on
the
evidence.
it
pains
me
to
say
that
the
ruling
was
erroneous.
i
thought
it
was
right
and
i
still
do.
but,
that
is
not
before
you.
the
first
circuit
has
decided
it
was
erroneous.
there
was
an
erroneous
ruling
on
the
evidence,
but
a
correct
ruling
on
the
state
of
the
evidence
in
granting
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
this
characterization
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
first
circuit
holds
is
in
accurate.
that
court
holds
that
the
critical
ruling
by
the
district
court
was
that
the
indictment
failed
to
charge
a
violation
of
section
1955
on
a
numbers
theory.
that
is
at
footnote
5
of
the
court’s
opinion
at
page
6
of
our
appendix
to
the
petition.
but,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
can
be
said
of
almost
any
erroneous
ruling
excluding
evidence
as
irrelevant.
when
a
court
decides
whether
evidence
is
to
be
admitted
or
not,
it
must
necessarily
interpret
the
scope
of
the
indictment.
if
it
interprets
the
scope
widely,
it
will
permit
in
more
evidence.
if
it
narrows
the
scope,
it
will
narrow
the
amount
of
evidence
that
comes
in.
but,
when
it
excludes
evidence
on
the
basis
of
irrelevancy,
that
exclusion
is
no
more
appealable
than
if
it
erroneously
excluded
evidence
because
it
was
incompetent.
here,
the
court
of
appeals
says
not
that
the
indictment
was
dismissed
but
that
it
was
effectively
dismissed
and
not
that
evidence
was
excluded
but
that
the
charge
was
excluded.
it
speaks
of
excluding
the
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
and
this
is
adapted
by
the
government,
that
the
numbers
charge
was
a
discrete
basis
for
imposing
criminal
liability.
this
discrete
basis
was
effectively
dismissed.
we
have
here
what
i
respectfully
consider
to
be
a
new
vocabulary
introduced
in
to
the
criminal
law.indictments
are
divided
into
counts
as
we
all
know
but
now,
under
the
law
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit,
counts
are
to
be
further
divided
into
discrete
basis
of
liability,
which
i
call
in
my
notes
dbls,
discrete
basis
of
liability.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
if
the
law
of
the
first
circuit
is
to
become
the
law
of
the
land,
then
the
erroneous
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
recognize
a
dbl
and
a
resulting
exclusion
of
evidence
will
be
the
equivalent
of
a
dismissal
of
that
dbl
and
any
judgment
that
results
will
be
appealable
as,
of
course,
only
to
that
dbl.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
discrete
basis
of
liability,
my
shorthand
expression
for
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
puts
a
limit
on
this
dbl
kind
of
theory
by
saying
that
you
can
have
a
dbl
that
has
constitutional
double
jeopardy
significance
only
where
the
count
is
duplicitous.
that
is,
the
dbl
must
be
one
of
the
offenses
contained
in
the
indictment.
the
government
takes
a
more
extreme
view.
because
the
government
concedes
that
the
first
circuit
was
in
error
when
it
held
that
this
particular
indictment
was
duplicitous,
it
now
must
take
the
position
if
it
is
going
to
claim
successfully
to
this
dbl
theory,
it
must
take
the
position
that
a
dbl
must
still
be
treated
as
a
separate
offense
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
analysis
even
though
the
count
is
not
duplicitous.
so
that
under
the
government’s
definition,
i
think
it
is
possible
to
isolate
several
dbls
in
this
indictment
in
this
one
count.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
dbl
recognition
will
become
a
very
important
part
of
the
skills
of
every
defense
lawyer
because
his
failure
to
recognize
a
dbl
could
have
drastic
double
jeopardy
consequences.
but
in
this
particular
count,
the
charge
is
that
the
defendant
accepted,
recorded,
and
registered
bets
on
horses
and
numbers.
you
have
accepting
bets
on
numbers,
recording
bets
on
numbers,
and
registering
bets
on
numbers.
you
have
got
three
dbls
there.
then,
you
have
got
skill,
speed,
and
endurance
of
horses,
and
yet
accepting
bets
on
the
skill
of
the
horse
and
recording
bets
on
the
skill
of
the
horse
and
registering
bets
on
the
skill
of
the
horse.
it
just
keeps
going
on
and
on
and
on.
you
might
get
into
the
hundreds
of
these
dbls.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
incorporate
that
into
our
law,
it
should
be
prospective
because,
lord
knows,
nobody
really
recognizes
this
theory
up
until
now.
lawyers
ought
to
have
a
time
to
learn
what
these
dbls
are.
also,
the
district
courts
ought
to
be
instructed
liberally
to
grant
particulars.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
think
he
did
that,
not
at
all.
what
he
did
was
to
exclude
evidence
under
that
dbl.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
he
excluded
the
numbers
evidence.
the
numbers
was
an
identified
dbl
according
to
the
court
of
appeals.
by
excluding
that
evidence,
the
court
of
appeals
says
he
effectively
dismissed
the
numbers
dbl,
so
to
speak.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes,
effectively
dismissed.
that
is
the
government’s
position.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
what
he
did
was
exclude
evidence
and
then
on
the
state
of
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
on
the
state
of
the
evidence,
after
the
exclusion,
he
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
all
he
did
was
say
that
i
am
going
to
exclude
the
numbers
and
i
am
going
to
exclude
all
evidence
of
numbers
because
the
only
evidence
i
am
going
to
let
in
is
the
evidence
of
the
horses.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
think
you
have
got
the
problem
of
an
intellectually
dishonest
judge
at
least.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
your
honor,
what
can
i
say?
the
defendant
did
not
appoint
the
judge.
the
government
had
more
to
do
with
the
appointment
than
we
did.
it
is
purely
incompetence.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
defense?
he
is
delighted.
what
does
the
government
do?
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
the
evidence
gets
excluded
erroneously
and
then,
correctly,
a
judgment
of
acquittal
is
entered.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant.
he
might
say
“i
am
going
to
let
in
all
bank
robbery
evidence
but
the
evidence
you
have
is
incompetence.
it
is
all
hearsay.
i
am
excluding
it
on
that
basis.”
he
could
be
100
percent
wrong,
but
that
is
the
system.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes,
you
get
pretty
close
to
that
issue.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes,
you
do.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
would
say.
that
is
best
close
as
you
can
come
to
the
fong
foo
case.
also
critical
to
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
was
that
there
should
have
been
an
objection
to
the
indictment
before
trial,
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
indictment.
ten
people
were
eventually
convicted
under
the
indictment
and
sanabria
himself
could
have
been
convicted
if
the
government
had,
in
any
way,
been
able
to
connect
him
with
the
gambling
business
defined
in
the
indictment.
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
that
there
was
no
support
for
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss
if
there
had
been
one.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
even
with
the
numbers
evidence
out,
he
was
in
jeopardy
in
conviction
under
the
horse
aspect
because
there
might
have
been
some
or
little
evidence
left
in
there
connecting
him
with
the
horses.
he
was
in
jeopardy
on
both.
but,
the
government
says
that
although
we
had
no
ground
for
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss,
we
should
have
objected
to
the
indictment
beforehand.
i
do
not
know
of
any
such
objection
under
the
rule
as
it
existed
then,
but
the
government
says
that
in
some
way,
we
should
have
pointed
out
the
mis-citation
of
section
37.
our
position
is
that
there
was
no
mis-citation.
section
37
was
a
perfectly
valid
part
o
the
massachusetts
statute
and
the
indictment
was
a
fine
coherent
hold.
i
just
do
not
see
that
there
was
any
ground
for
any
type
of
motion
before
trial.
what
the
government
is
really
saying
is
that
we
should
have
written
a
letter
to
them
and
say
“gentlemen,
we
think
that
what
you
really
intend
to
do
here
is
to
charge
not
only
a
violation
of
section
17
but
also
a
violation
of
section
7.
i
think
you
better
amend
your
indictment
or
go
back
and
get
a
new
one
because
while
you
will
be
able
to
convict
10
of
the
clients
here,
sanabria,
we
are
told
has
no
evidence
of
engaging
in
horse
betting
so,
therefore,
you
better
go
back
and
get
a
different
approach.”
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
it
depends
on
what
position
you
are
in.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
in
this
case,
he
decided
that
the
indictment
was
perfectly
valid.
it
could
not
be
dismissed.
i
had
moved.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
no,
he
did
not.
you
speak
of
numbers
crime,
however,
as
though
you
were
speaking
of
a
separate
offense.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
no,
i
am
not
making
that.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
your
premise
is
wrong.
your
question
has
got
a
wrong
premise.
you
are
talking
about
a
crime.
there
was
no
numbers
crime
as
such.
the
crime
was
violating
state
law.
the
judge
thought
that
the
violation
of
state
law
in
the
manner
by
means
of
numbers
did
not
satisfy
the
indictment.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
the
indictment
could
have
charged
the
crime.
if
it
would
have
been
written
differently,
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
evidence
was
relevant.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
knew
what
crime
was
being
charged
but
i
knew
also
that
it
was
been
narrowed
and
particularized
to
a
violation
of
horse
betting.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
says
and
the
government
adapts
the
argument
that
we
gave
up
our
valued
right
to
a
verdict,
which
i
think
i
have
covered
before.
we
never
thought
that
by
moving
to
exclude
evidence
and
then
moving
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
we
were
waiving
anything
or
giving
up
any
right.
i
do
not
see
how
anybody
can
fairly
say
that
our
decision
to
move
for
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence
or
to
object
to
the
evidence
and
then
to
move
for
judgment
of
acquittal
could,
in
any
way,
constitute
a
waiver
of
anything
so
valuable
as
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
crime.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
only
because
the
rule
puts
the
obligation
on
defense
counsel
not
to
waste
the
court’s
time
by
sending
a
case
to
the
jury
under
instructions
that
will
inevitably
result
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
think
that.
i
think
i
fulfilled
an
obligation
to
the
court
not
to
waste
its
time.
i
do
not
think
i
made
the
choice
in
the
sense
that
i
was
sacrificing
something
for
my
client
in
order
to
gain
some
benefit.
i
was
simply
following
the
rules
and
correct
procedure.
it
is
a
natural
thing
to
do
for
a
lawyer
with
more
than
six
months
experience.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes,
they
might
have
come
back
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
i
have
to
assume
that
all
juries
do
the
right
thing.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
that
is
a
good
point.
in
this
case,
i
am
confident
the
jury
would
have
recognized
it
because
i
am
confident
that
the
judge,
under
the
instructions
of
the
judge,
his
instructions
would
have
been
so
explicit.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
do
not
like
to
use
that
kind
of
phraseology.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
see
if
you
will
accept
mine.
he
had
made
a
determination
as
to
the
scope
of
the
indictment.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
the
scope
of
the
indictment,
as
determined
by
him,
was
now
then
argued
by
the
government.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
that,
may
i
respectfully
say,
if
we
reason
it
that
way
then
i
know
of
no
ruling
excluding
evidence
that
cannot
be
tortured
into
an
appealable
result.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
excluding
evidence
on
the
basis
of
relevancy.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
am
saying
excluding
on
the
basis
of
relevancy.
once
you
say
evidence
is
excluded
because
it
is
irrelevant,
then
you
are
necessarily
defining
the
scope
of
the
indictment.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
yes,
but
you
are
returning
to
the
charge.
mr.
francis
j.
dimento
i
think
that
we
can
carry
to
its
extremes
by
using
the
example
of
the
judge
who
has
the
bank
robbery
indictment
and
says
“i
am
just
going
to
exclude
all
evidence
of
bank
robbery.”
and
although
that
is
terribly
erroneous,
it
is
still
