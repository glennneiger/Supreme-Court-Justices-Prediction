justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
let
me
be
sure
i
have
your
position
on
the
lee
case.
you
are
taking
the
position
that
if
the
case
had
gone
to
the
jury
and
lee
had
been
acquitted
because
of
the
judgeâ€™s
view
of
striking
evidence
and
so
forth,
that
acquittal
could
have
been
appealed
as
though
it
were
a
dismissal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
matter
of
detail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right.
it
was
a
bench
trial.
had
it
been
a
jury
trial
and
they
had
gone
to
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
not?because,
supposing
the
reason
there
was
an
acquittal
is
because
of
an
erroneous
theory
of
the
indictment
and
erroneous
instruction
of
the
jury
which,
in
effect,
excluded
as
in
this
case
the
evidence
relating
to
horse
betting
or
numbers,
whichever
one
it
is.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
instruction
they
could
not
convict,
under
the
instruction,
faithfully
applied,
they
could
not
convict.
they
might
have
done
it
for
an
irrational
reason
and
you
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
irrationality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because
by
hypothesis
there
is
no
proof
on
the
only
permissible
theory
in
which
you
could
go
to
the
jury.
it
is
nothing
to
disbelieve.
but,
you
still
say
that
acquittal
would
not
be
a
dismissal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier
that,
in
this
case,
if
it
had
gone
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
had
acquitted
that
that
was
a
matter
of
detail
and
there
could
be
another
trial
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
know,
if
they
submitted?
maybe
they
did
not
believe
somebody,
just
the
same
example
you
gave
me
earlier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
have
entrusted
the
jury
that
the
evidence
relating
to
horse
betting,
whichever
one
that
was
stricken,
is
not
to
be
considered
by
you.
but,
if
having
that
evidence
out,
you
still
find
him
guilty
of
horse
betting,
that
is
the
only
theory
on
which
you
can
find
him
guilty
is
that
you
find
evidence
of
horse
betting
and
i
have
stricken
all
the
evidence
of
horse
betting.
then,
they
say
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
they
acquit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
say,
he
submits
both
issues
to
the
jury.
i
am
sorry.
i
am
not
getting
the
example
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
he
take
it
out
in
this
case
other
than
by
excluding
the
evidence?
that
is
all
he
did.
then,
he
said
there
is
no
evidence
so
i
am
going
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
but,
if
the
jury
did
precisely
the
same
thing
you
say
it
is
a
dismissal,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jury
was
not
free,
i
suppose,
to
include
that
defendants
were
guilty
if
they
thought
they
were
guilty
of
the
numbers
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
special
charge
is
under
the
jury
then?
they
acquitted
on
the
single
count
of
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
gone
because
he
excluded
the
evidence.
he
did
not
tell
the
jury
anything
about
the
indictment.
he
just
excluded
that
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question
then
i
will
stop.
i
apologize
for
taking
so
much
time,
but
would
you
agree
that
on
the
numbers
charge,
which
apparently
that
would
now
be
regarded
in
the
first
circuit
as
sufficient
indictment
on
the
numbers
charge
as
well
as
the
horse
betting
charge,
that
the
defendant
was
actually
put
in
jeopardy
on
the
numbers
charge
assuming
two
separate
theories
liability
when
the
first
witness
began
to
testify
or
maybe
when
the
jury
was
sworn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
just
one
other
question
on
appealability.
at
the
outset,
you
mentioned
that
you
view
criminal
appeals
act.
an
appeal
lies
wherever
it
is.
the
second
trial
would
not
be
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
you
stated
that
the
court
has,
in
effect,
so
held.
are
you
referring
to
what
i
characterize
as
dicta
in
the
wilson
case?
