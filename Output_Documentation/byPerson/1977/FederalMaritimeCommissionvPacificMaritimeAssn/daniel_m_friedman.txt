mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
fifteen
of
shipping
act
requires
persons
covered
by
the
act
to
file
with
the
federal
maritime
commission,
a
category,
seven
different
categories
of
agreements.
one
of
which
is
every
agreement
controlling
regulating
preventing
or
destroying
competition.
now
the
commission
is
instructed
by
the
statute
to
disapprove
agreements
that
fail
to
meet
certain
statutory
criteria
and
to
approve
all
others.
it
is
illegal
either
to
carry
out
either
an
agreement
of
that
the
commission
has
not
approved
subject
to
the
act
or
one
that
has
been
disapproved,
and
any
agreement
approved
by
the
commission,
thereby
obtains
antitrust
immunity.
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
first
one
is
whether
section
fifteen
covers
any
provision
of
collective-bargaining
agreements,
and
the
second
is
if
that
question
is
answered
affirmatively
whether
the
federal
maritime
commission
in
this
case,
properly
denied
to
the
particular
provisions
here
involved
a
labor
exemption
and
exemption
that
the
commission
has
recognized
as
appropriate
under
section
15
for
collective-bargaining
in
certain
circumstances.
the
respondent,
the
pacific
maritime
association
is
an
employers
association
comprised
of
most
of
the
employees
in
the
west
coast
maritime
industry,
steam
ship
companies
terminal
operators
and
stevedores.
the
respondent
international
longshoremen's
and
warehousemen's
union
is
the
collective-bargaining
represented
of
the
employees
in
that
industry
and
bargaining
on
the
pacific
west
coast
generally
take
place
on
an
areawide
basis.
there
are
however
a
small
number
of
employers
operating
on
the
west
coast
who
are
not
members
of
pacific
maritime
industry
including
a
number
of
ports
on
the
pacific
west
coast,
that
operate
their
own
terminal
facilities.
since
1935,
pma
and
its
predecessors
in
the
union
have
operated
under
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
provided
detail
arrangements
governing
the
operation
of
the
waterfront
on
the
west
cost.
the
most
important
aspects
of
this
is
that
together
they
have
organized
in
control
a
joint
registered
workforce,
a
force
which
is
registered
and
which
is
dispatched
under
union
hiring
halls
that
are
jointly
administrated
to
particular
employers
on
a
job
basis,
the
men
are
rotated,
you
do
not
have
a
particular
crew
working
full
time
for
a
particular
employer.
the
men
are
rotated
from
job
to
job
as
the
jobs
come
up.
the
pma
has
a
very
elaborate
system
of
central
record
keeping
and
payroll
records,
everyone
is
paid
centrally
even
though
they
work
for
one
employer
for
two
days
and
another
employer
for
three
days
of
the
week,
and
in
addition
there
is
a
very
extensive
jointly
operated
fringe-benefit
program
under
which
they
have
a
guaranteed
annual
wage,
pension
plans,
welfare
plans,
vacations
plans
and
so
on
and
all
members
of
pma
are
required
to
contribute
to
the
fund
that
sustains
these
fringe-benefits.
now
prior
to
1972
which
was
when
the
agreement
involved
in
this
case
was
negotiated.
employers
who
are
not
members
of
pma
could
obtain
men
from
registered
workforce,
union
members
by
negotiating
directly
with
the
local
unions
involved
in
their
particular
areas
and
this
happened
frequently
separate
contracts
were
negotiated
between
many
of
the
ports
involved
in
this
case
and
the
local
union.
and
in
addition
the
individual
ports
were
able
to
negotiate
for
the
fringe-benefits
provided
under
the
master
contract
by
a
participation
agreement
that
they
negotiated
with
pma
and
the
union.
and
under
this
arrangement,
the
union
permitted
some
of
the
nonmembers
employers
to
use
what
they
called
steady
gangs
or
steady
men
that
is
men
who
worked
full
time
for
one
employer
rather
being
rotated
from
individual
to
individual.
pma
was
of
the
view
of
that
the
nonmembers
use
of
the
registered
work
force
has
it
functioned
put
its
members
the
pma
members
under
what
they
described
as
an
obvious
competitive
disadvantage
as
against
the
nonmembers.
and
a
major
reason,
pma's
president
indicated,
page
90
of
the
record
was
that
under
this
arrangement
if
pma
members
will
close
down
as
result
of
a
labor
dispute,
the
members
of
the
ports
who
are
not
members
could
continue
to
operate
because
they
were
not
bound
by
the
arrangements,
they
were
not
members
of
pma
and
as
result
of
this
cargo
and
business
was
diverted
from
the
members
of
pma
during
these
periods
of
labor
disturbance
to
the
nonmembers,
which
they
thought
was
gave
the
nonmembers,
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
they
also
believed
that
the
use
of
the
steady
men
gave
them
an
advantage
and
finally
they
thought
that
it
gave
the
nonmembers
an
advantage
that
they
were
not
required
to
pay
their
full
share
of
the
fringe-benefits,
in
the
same
way
the
pma
members
were,
and
after
extensive
bargaining
in
1972,
pma
and
the
union
agreed
upon
something
called
the
nonmember
participation
agreement.
an
arrangement
that
was
made
a
part
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
the
provisions
provides
that
nonmembers
must
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
nonmembers
participation
agreement
as
a
condition
to
using
the
registered
work
force.
now,
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
a
number
of
provisions
at
pages
10
and
11
of
a
brief
a
number
provisions
of
this
nonmember
participation
agreement,
that
had
an
impact
upon
the
nonmembers
but
there
are
two
of
them
that
i
would
like
to
stress
at
this
argument
because
those
are
the
ones
we
think
that
probably
have
the
greatest
impact
in
terms
of
competition.
the
first
thing
was
that
the
nonmembers
must
use
the
registered
workforce
upon
the
same
terms
as
the
members
which
included
drawing
them
off
course
from
the
hiring
halls
which
they
had
been
doing
in
the
past
and
a
limited
use
of
them
in
the
case
there
were
union
works
stoppages
against
pma
to
the
same
extent
that
members
of
pma
were
limited
and
the
non-member
participation
agreement
stated
the
essence
of
the
this
requirement
was
the
acceptance
by
nonmembers
participants
of
the
principle
that
a
work
stoppage
ilwu
against
pma
members
is
a
work
stoppage
against
nonmember
participants.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
work
stoppage
against
pma
the
nonmembers
of
pma
nevertheless
would
be
bound
not
to
use
the
work
force
at
the
time
pma
members
were
barred
from
it.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
nonmembers
who
wished
to
use
the
registered
workforce
had
to
participate
in
the
fringe-benefit
plan
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
pma
members,
that
is
they
had
to
same
payments
to
the
fringe-benefit
program
that
pma
members
would
make.
after
the
union
and
pma
agreed
upon
this
nonmember
participation
agreement,
they
endeavored
to
get
the
nonmember
ports
to
sign
the
agreement
and
they
pointed
out
to
the
nonmember
ports
that
unless
they
sign
this
agreement
they
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
registered
workforce
and
that
is
set
forth
at
pages
65
and
77
of
the
appendix.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
some
ports
as
i
understand
it
where
no
one
is
a
member,
there
there
are
other
ports
where
the
port
operated
facilities
are
not
but
there
are
other
facilities
in
the
port
that
are
operated
by
pma.
pma,
by
the
way
will
accept
anyone
to
membership
who
agrees
to
its
terms
but
i
use
this
as
kind
shorthand
it
is
really
all
nonmembers
of
pma
who
engage
in
any
of
these
activities
but
this
particular
case
basically
involves
the
ports.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
primarily
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
there
all
public
bodies
and
the
public
bodies
are
required
under
the
state
statute
to
do
certain
things
and
do
not
do
certain
things.
the
response
of
the
ports
to
the
adoption
of
this
nonmembers
participation
agreement
and
the
endeavors
by
the
union
and
pma
to
get
them
to
join
it
and
sign
up,
was
two
things.
first,
they
filed
a
complaint
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
secondly
they
file
three
antitrust
cases.
two
of
those
are
still
pending,
the
third
has
been
dismissed.
the
complain
with
the
commission
alleged
that
this
nonmembers
participation
agreements
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
this
was
dismissed
by
the
plaintiff.
the
records
indicates
they
decided
to
dismiss
its
employees.
and
i
might
add
that
the
antitrust
complaint
that
was
dismissed
challenge
only
one
narrow
aspect
of
this
particular
nonmember
participation
agreements.
something
dealing
with
what
they
call
stuffing
and
unstuffing
of
the
containers
at
the
waterfront
and
that
has
dropped
out
of
the
case
because
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
held
of
that
was
illegal
"hot
cargo"
clause
so
that
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
they
alleged
that
the
nonmember
participation
agreement
was
an
agreement
that
had
to
be
filed
under
section
fifteen
and
that
was
an
illegal
agreement
under
both
section
fifteen
and
also
several
other
sections
of
the
act
and
they
urged
the
board
to
take
jurisdictions
of
the
case
and
to
disapprove
the
agreements,
i
am
sorry
the
commission
on
the
board.
the
commission
severed
for
preliminary
determination,
two
question
in
the
case
one
whether
section
fifteen
covered
this
agreement
and
second
if
it
did
whether
it
was
entitled
to
a
labor
exemption.
lengthy
affidavits
were
filed
in
the
case
and
the
basic
point
the
ports
made
was
that
the
registered
work
force
contains
the
skilled
people
necessary
to
operate
these
facilities
and
without
the
skilled
people
they
could
not
effectively
operate
their
facilities.
on
the
other
hand
the
ports
pointed
out
that
if
they
intended
to
use
nonunion
labor
if
they
could
get
it
to
do
this
work
the
union
undoubtedly
would
throw
picket
lines
around
and
close
down
the
ports.
if
on
the
other
hand
they
singed
up
under
this
agreement,
it
would
do
two
things
according
to
the
ports,
one
it
would
increase
their
expenses
for
variety
of
reasons
and
secondly
it
would
turn
over
control
of
their
labor
relations
which
under
their
statute
they
are
obliged
to
handle
to
third
persons
because
they
were
bound
by
doing
this
--
they
would
bind
themselves
to
all
of
the
requirements
of
pma.
the
commission
held
that
it
has
jurisdiction
under
section
fifteen
over
this
agreement
and
that
the
agreement
was
not
entitled
to
a
labor
exemption.
now,
the
commission
applied
the
standards
it
had
developed
in
the
case
called
boston
shipping
to
determine
the
existence
of
a
labor
exemption.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice
but
the
commission's
theory
is
that
since
an
antitrust
exemption
results
when
they
approve
an
agreement
under
section
15
and
since
competitive
considerations
are
a
important
factor
in
the
commission's
administration
of
section
15,
it
is
appropriate
to
imply
under
statute
a
labor
exemption
(inaudible)
for
that
this
court
has
developed
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
is
the
basic
theory
upon
which
the
commission
operates.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
incorrect,
the
all
the
commission
has
done
is
make
the
threshold
determinations
that
the
agreement
has
to
be
filed
and
that
is
entitled
to
labor
exemption--
and
indeed
after
it
makes
those
determinations,
it
issued
another
order
setting
the
issues
on
the
merits
for
hearing
a
determination.
the
commission
said
that
this
was
an
agreement
which
controlled
or
affected
competition
between
members
and
the
nonmembers
and
therefore
was
covered
by
section
fifteen
and
accordingly
was
applied
to
the
filed
unless
a
labor
exemption
existed.
it
found
there
was
no
labor
exemption
for
two
reasons
under
two
of
the
criteria
it
had
developed
under
boston
shipping.
first
it
said,
this
provision
did
not
relate
to
a
mandatory
condition
of
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
because
it
was
directed
not
of
the
labor
conditions
of
the
members
of
pma
but
to
the
labor
conditions
of
third
persons,
that
is
the
nonmembers
of
the
ports.
in
addition
the
second
related
issue
is
since
it
attempted
to
impose
terms
and
conditions
on
people
outside
of
the
membership
of
pma
was
in
attempting
to
impose
those
conditions
beyond
the
bargaining
unit.
it
concluded
that
this
nonmember
participation
agreement
had
a
potentially
severe
and
adverse
effect
upon
competition
but
only
a
minimal
effect
on
the
collective-bargaining
process,
that
is
cited
on
page
70
a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
that
is
not,
that
means
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct-this
would
not
--
this
ruling
of
the
commission
granting
a
“labor
exemption”
would
not
be
an
approval
under
under
section
fifteen.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
but
of
course
in
considering
whether
there
is
a
“labor
exemption”
they
do
carefully
consider
the
impact
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but,
this
is
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
the
commission..
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
no
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
they
could.
if
we
prevail
in
this
case
so
the
commission
will
go
ahead
it
could
approved
or
could
disapprove.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yeah,
the
only
issues,
i
repeat
is
the
threshold
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
filed
it,
in
effect
they
would
i
presume
they
would
in
effect
return
it.
that
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
do
not
approve
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
that
is
the
effect.
that
would
be
the
effect
in
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
could
not
tell
you.
i
hope
to
get
the
answer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes
yes
they
have
not-
there
is
no
approve..
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
has
not
been
approved
or
disapproved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
a
fact
that
would
you
have
to
preliminarily
file
it
in
order,
i
suppose
for
them
to
know
whether
it
has
a
--
but
at
the-
the
end
result
of
giving
it
a
“labor
exemption”
is
that
it
did
not
have
to
be
filed
at
all
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
its
over
because.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
anti-trust
court
and
i
assume
the
anti-trust
court
would
not
be
bound
of
course
by
the
commissions
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
what-
if
that
t
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
all
i
am
suggesting
is
sometimes
you
may
have
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
to
determine
whether
you
had
to
file.
indeed,
sometimes
people
will
file
an
agreement
requesting
a
ruling
but
it
does
not
have
to
be
filed
to
be
sure
that
they
are
not
subject
to
the
shipping
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
draws
upon
those
decisions
but
it
brings
to
their
--
its
expertise
on
the
shipping
industry
and
balancing
and
weighing
the
competing
impact
on
the
one
hand
on
collective
bargaining
and
laboring
too
or
the
other
hand
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
weighing
the
competing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes
yes
its
says
in
fact
it
states
that
the
exemption
is
drawn
from
those
decisions
and
its
four
criteria
that
it
developed
in
boston
shipping
was
stated
to
be
its
view
of
a
distillation
of
the
teachings
of
this
court
and
the
anti-trust
immunity
cases
and
indeed
in
this
sort,
it
thought
that
this
particular
agreement
was
very
similar
and
it
is
ultimate
in
fact,
its
ultimate
contours
to
the
agreement
this
court
held
was
not
entitled
to
a
“labor
exemption”
in
the
pennington
case
because
it
said
in
both
cases
its
a
contract
under
which
attempts
are
made
impose
terms
and
conditions
outside
of
the
bargaining
and
of
course
in
pennington
there
was
an
attempt
to
drive
the
people
out
of
business
which
is
not
here
but
it
seems
and
we
fully
agree
that
the
basic
rationale
of
those
decisions,
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
labor
and
management
cannot
get
together,
in
an
attempt
to
impose
terms
and
conditions
outside
the
bargaining
unit,
employers
outside
the
bargaining.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
to
an
extent
to
the
extent
for
example
where
it
has
to
consider
whether
something
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
and
if
this
court
has
interpreted
that
provision
under
“national
labor
relation
act”,
to
be
drawn
on
those
cases,
basically
what
i
would
say
is
it
draws
upon
the
antitrust
cases
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
“labor
exemption”
but
then
it
implicates
shipping
act
considerations
when
it
decides
whether
or
not
the
particular
agreement
is
entitled
to
the
“labor
exemption”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
probably
is
because
our
opponents
challenged
and
the
opponents
say
that
the
commission
has
improperly
defined
“labor
exemption”.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
because
that
presents
the
general
contours,
the
general
cause,
i
think
that
real
criticism
with
us,
perhaps
is
more
in
the
application
of
that
test
to
the
facts
of
this
case
than
in
the
test
itself.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
quarrel
between
us
that
the
commission
properly
can
drew
upon
this
court's
decisions
defining
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
“labor
exemption”
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
“labor
exemption”
under
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
you
only
reach
the
question
of
the
“labor
exemption”
if
you
agree
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
these
some
agreements.
and
let
me
address
my
self
to
that
question
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
labor
--
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
exempt
as
a
class
from
the
requirements
of
section
fifteen.
now
section
in
the
shipping
act
congress
provided
are
almost
unique
regulatory
scheme.
agreements
that
would
be
illegal
in
any
other
industry
under
the
antitrust
laws
may
be
permissible
in
the
shipping
act
provided
that
the
government
regulatory
agency
has
examined
these
agreements,
has
evaluated
them
under
the
standards
an
has
determined
its
overall
and
the
public
interest
taking
hand
over
all
competing
and
conflicting
considerations
to
approve
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
i
think
is
tends
to
be
narrow
in
the
sense
that
i
think,
there
are
certain
types
of
agreements
but
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
pervasive
character
of
concerted
agreements
and
operations
in
the
shipping
industry,
i
mean
the
statute
was
passed
as
the
court
knows
against
the
background
of
the
alexander
report
under
the
shipping
conference
system
and
we
are
not
for
this
legislation
or
conference
agreement
which
have
even
fixes
its
prices.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
one
of
the
provisions
which
the
court
applies,
which
the
statute
provides
is
that
agreements
controlling
regulating,
preventing
or
destroying
competition
have
to
be
filed
with
the
commission.
there
is
no
question
that
some
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
would
have
that
effect.
in
this
case
the
parties
agreed
to
required
things
to
be
done
by
the
nonmember
ports
that
would
have
that
impact
upon
the
ports.
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
whole
scheme
of
the
shipping
act
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
a
blanket
exemption
of
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
from
the
shipping
act.
and
what
we
think
is
that
congress
intend
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
to
take
a
look
at
anti-
competitive
agreements
even
though
they
may
have
been
the
result
of
competitive
bargaining
and
that
national
labor
policy
is
to
be
implicated
not
by
saying
that
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
any
of
these
agreements
but
through
the
application
of
the
“labor
exemption”
that
the
commission
has
determined.
the
“labor
exemption”
itself
in
this
case
that
was
properly
projected
by
the
commission
because
as
the
commission
stated
and
this
is
the
page
63a
of
the
appendix.
the
agreement
was
specifically
designed
to
compel
nonmember
entities
to
join
pma
under
the
threat
of
exclusion
from
the
ilwu
workforce.
as
such
it
clearly
imposes
terms
and
conditions
upon
persons
outside
of
the
bargaining
group
and
this
court
pennington
recognized
so
that
there
is
nothing
in
national
labor
policy
indicating
that
the
union
and
the
employers
in
one
bargaining
are
the
free
to
bargain
about
the
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
of
other
bargaining
units
or
to
attempt
to
settle
these
matters
for
the
entire
industry
and
that
we
think
is
precisely
what
this
agreement
was
designed
to
do,
pma
was
putting
in
to
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
agreement
or
the
concurrence
of
the
union,
provisions
designed
to
eliminate
what
pma
viewed
as
unfair
competition
by
its
competitive
factors
in
the
industry
by
the
nonmember
ports
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
“labor
exemption”
can
be
invoked
to
justify
that
kind
of
an
agreement.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
precisely
the
question,
and
precisely
the
reason
why
this
is
not
a
matter
for
federal
maritime
commission
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
know
what
the
labor
board
would
do
in
a
case
like
this
and
i
do
not
know
that
the
labor
board
has
ever
decided
such
a
case,
where
you
have
single
unit
of
employees,
a
single
unit
of
employees
represented
by
the
same
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
understand
that,
that
is
the
position
in
united
states.
it
was
not
the
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
not
our
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
question
that
you
raised
i
submit
mr
justice
white
raises
a
very
subtle
significant
and
important
question
of
labor
relations,
precisely
what
would
the
national
labor
relations
board
do
when
confronted
with
the
situation
where
there
is
a
single
employee
bargaining
unit
interchangeable
employees
and
if
you
will,
two
separate
of
employer
bargaining
units.
now
however
that
question
is
resolved
on
this
issue.
when
the
solicitor
general
says
it
should
be
resolved
about
pennington
and
connell
and
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment,
why
we
think
it
should
not
be
resolved
that
way.
but
however
it
is
resolved.
it
is
our
submission
that
it
should
be
resolved
by
the
agency
that
has
the
expertise
to
make
that
subtle
decision
in
labor
relations
and
not
by
the
federal
maritime
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
have
enough
familiarity
mr
justice
rehnquist
with
what
the
cab
does
in
labor
relations
to
answer
your
question.
my
familiarity
is
essentially
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
since
the
beginning
of
this
case
--
so
i
am
just
unable
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
labor
board
does
not
get
involved
in
the
antitrust
question
per
se,
what
it
does
get
involved
in
is
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
bargaining
unit.
in
this
situation,
as
mr
fisher
pointed
out
in
the
container
stuffing
situation,
the
complaining
parties,
the
ports
filed
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
have
the
issue
of
legality
of
that
container
stuffing
agreement
determined
by
the
expertise
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
of
course
they
could
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
and
the
employer
to
enter
in
to
a
contract
to
compel
the
employers
or
the
union
to
seize
doing
business
with
the
ports.
i
think
it
is
8(b)(1)
or
8
(b)(2).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
it
might
be
an
8e
agreement
as
it
was
charged
to
be
in
the
container
cases.
there
is
no
question
that
in
resolving
these
preliminary
questions
that
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
labor
exemption
in
the
illustration
i
have
given
shows
the
subtle,
the
kind
of
labor
relations
decisions
has
to
be
made.
the
maritime
commission
is
undertaking
to
do
the
job
that
congress
has
said
should
be
done
by
the
labor
board.
to
support
the
contention
that
there
is
a
unique
situation
in
the
west
coast
which
does
not
apply
on
to
which
pennington
and
connell
do
not
apply
is
the
solicitor's
concession
on
pages
six
and
seven
of
this
replied
brief,
extremely
important
from
the
union's
point
of
view.
in
view
of
the
existing
institutions
on
the
west
coast
and
they
are
unique
and
special
institutions.
it
has
been
indicated
in
the
brief
established
for
the
employment
of
longshoremen.
some
agreement,
solicitor
can
some
agreement
on
the
access
of
non
members
to
the
joint
pma
programs,
the
joint
pma,
ilwu
programs
and
facilities
is
necessary.
in
order
this
is
a
jointly
controlled
work
force.
the
union
can
not
say
to
the
non
members
you
can
have
the
work
force.
it
has
got
to
have
pma's
consent
because
it
is
a
joint
work
force.
it
is
not
a
union
controlled
work
force,
and
the
solicitor
recognizes
it
therefore
some
agreement
is
necessary.
again,
he
argues
that
this
agreement
is
entitled
to
labor
exemption
because
it
is
outside
the
bargaining
unit
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated,
we
have
the
very
unique
situation
with
respect
to
what
is
a
bargaining
unit
here
and
that
is
a
question
that
the
labor
board
meets
rather
than
the
federal
maritime
commission
need
to
determine.
so
it
is
our
submission
that
where
the
employees
involved
are
common
to
both
sets
of
employers,
you
do
not
have
pennington
situation,
you
do
not
have
a
connell
situation
where
the
union
represents
all
of
the
employees
and
in
pennington,
they
did
not
and
in
connell
was
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion,
the
union
not
only
did
not
represent
the
employees,
in
that
case
it
was
not
even
seeking
to
represent.
here
it
represents
the
employees
of
both
sets
of
employers
where
you
have
got
a
situation
like
this,
you
have
got
to
special
kind
of
a
unique
labor
situation
and
the
commission
was
just,
the
federal
maritime
commission
was,
with
respect
not
even
unsophisticated
to
say
what
the
labor
board
might
have
done
or
would
have
done
under
these
circumstances
and
in
attempting
to
apply
this
court
and
the
labor
board's
criteria
and
its
so
called
distillation
of
this
court's
decisions.
for
them,
the
union
was
faced
as
the
solicitor
concedes
in
these
very
negotiations
with
the
proposition
that
pma
had
the
right
to
insist
on
equality
of
treatment,
on
the
most
favored
nation's
clause
and
if
the
union
had
given
the
non-members
anything
better
than
it
gave
pma,
pma
would
have
said
give
to
us
too
and
the
union
would
have
been
whipsawed
between
two
sets
of
employers.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
union
and
the
association
negotiated
in
the
best
interest
in
solving
very
difficult
labor
problem.
i
believe
they
are
entitled
to
labor
exemption
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
briefs,
we
think
that
maritime
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
have
time
to
expand
upon
that
but
i
will
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
courts
do
not
choose
to
file,
(inaudible)
judges
and
the
question
there
is,
what
is
the
proper
form
for
the
preservation
of
these
issues
that
court's
or
the
federal
maritime
commission.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first
just
a
preliminary
matter
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
as
to
what
actually
happens
if
the
board
grants
a
labor
exemption,
i
understand
if
that
takes
place
the
commission
would
enter
a
declaratory
order
to
affect
that
the
agreement
need
not
be
filed
and
then
dismiss
the
proceeding.
let
me
get
to
what
seems
to
me
is
as
the
argument
has
developed
kind
of
the
really
the
guts
of
this
case,
which
is
whether
this
is
the
sort
of
an
agreement
that
is
not
properly
before
the
maritime
commission
at
all.
the
suggestion
that
mr.
leonard
has
made
is
somehow
this
is
a
matter
to
be
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
well
mr.
justice
white
in
your
concurring
opinion,
your
opinion
in
jewel
tea,
you
pointed
out
that
the
labor
board
is
not
really
equipped
to
handle
these
things,
there
is
no
way
you
can
get
a
decision
out
of
the
labor
board,
all
you
can
do
is
file
a
charge
and
if
the
general
counsel
decides
not
to
issue
a
complaint
on
the
charge,
that
is
the
end
of
it.
but
more
significantly
than
that,
this
court
has
recognized
on
not
a
few
occasions
more,
most
recently
in
the
burlington
case,
that
situations
may
arise
where
and
cases
present
issues
involving
different
agencies,
in
the
burlington
case
there
were
problems
under
the
labor
act
and
there
were
problems
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
this
court
said
the
interstate
commerce
commission
properly
considered
the
problems
under
its
statute
and
if
something
were
filed
with
the
labor
board,
the
labor
board
would
construe
it.
now
the
claim
is,
an
argument
here
with
respect
to
the
bargaining
unit,
well
the
bargaining
unit
that
was
originally
certified
by
the
labor
board,
of
course,
was
the
employers
on
the
west
coast
who
are
members
of
the
predecessor
associations.
if
somebody
thinks
that
this
bargaining
unit
should
now
be
broadened
to
include
the
non-members,
they
can
file
something
before
the
labor
board
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
commission
was
properly
and
fully
justified
in
accepting
the
case
as
it
existed
that
is,
as
of
now
what
you
have
is
a
bargaining
unit
consisting
of
these
employees,
some
of
them
work
for
pma
members,
most
of
them
do,
some
of
--
case
you
do
not
and
the
pma
members
and
when
you
attempt
to
impose
when
the
union
and
the
employers
get
together
and
attempt
to
impose
conditions
on
people
who
are
not
members,
those
are
people
outside
the
bargaining
unit
and
we
just
do
not
think
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
we
think
is
the
scheme
congress
has
provided
under
this
statute
that
not
only
is
there
antitrust
exemption
but
this
court
recognized
in
the
seatrain
case
that
in
interrupting
the
statute
whether
an
agreement
is
in
the
public
interest,
the
commission
is
required
to
consider
the
antitrust
implications
of
that
agreement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
authority
but
we
have
described
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
and
also
cited
in
burlington
maybe
the
commission
on
occasion
has
granted
this
so
called
conditional
or
interim
approval
to
provisions
that
are
included
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
they
have
done
this
on
a
couple
of
a
occasion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
has
not
been
implemented.
the
parties
have
kept
it
in
abance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
decision
as
is
true
with
the
administrative
proceedings
before
the
commission.
