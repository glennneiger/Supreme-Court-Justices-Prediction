mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
through
the
couple
of
the
questions
asked
by
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
clarify
a
couple
of
matters
if
i
do
so.
mr
justice
rehnquist
asked
whether
pma
had
any
members
who
were
ports.
mr
justice
rehnquist
request
to
mr.
friedman,
i
am
responding
to
pma
has
no
members
who
are
public
ports
at
the
present
time.
there
is
an
application
pending
by
one
court
to
join
but
public
port
authorities
generally
do
not
employ
stevedores,
the
non-member
ports
here
are
an
exception,
they
do
not
perform
stevedoring
themselves
and
therefore
they
do
no
employ
longshoreman.
so
in
the
normal
course
a
public
port
is
a
land
lord
as
in
the
case
of
the
port
of
san
fransisco
or
the
port
of
los
angles
and
you
do
not
find
them
having
need
to
have
labor
relations
with
the
ilwu
and
you
therefore
do
not
find
them
becoming
members
of
pma
or
otherwise
dealing
with
the
ilwu.
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
whether
it
might
be
the
equivalent
of
approving
the
agreement,
if
in
the
event
that
the
commission
determined
that
“labor
exemption”
applies.
i
would
say
that
is
clearly
not
the
case.
the
“labor
exemptions”
goes
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
the
agreements
to
act
one
way
or
the
other.
a
determination
--
in
fact
one
of
the
problems
with
having
the
commission
in
this
particular
act
is
that
the
determination
that
an
agreement
is
“labor
exempt
does
not
bind
any
body
for
the
future,
certainly
anyone
who
is
not
a
party
to
this
proceeding
is
free
to
turn
around
and
file
antitrust
complaint
after
the
facts.
so
a
determination
by
the
maritime
commission
that
you
have
a
“labor
exemption”
does
not
really
get
you
any
where
in
terms
of
security
if
you
will
wish
to
use
that
term
for
the
future.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
that
is
right
it
is
a
jurisdictional
determination
and
as
the
matter
of
fact,
in
industry
groups
such
as
ourselves
did
not
file
our
agreement
with
the
commission
to
ask
them
what
they
thought
of
it.
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
you
would
want
to
do
if
you
felt
that
the
commission
had
no
business
medaling
with
it.
in
this
case
the
nonmember
ports
brought
the
agreement
to
the
attention
of
the
commission.
we
ultimately
filed
the
document
because
it
had
to
be
looked
at
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
and
normally
you
would
sit
it
out
and
wait
for
someone
to
complain
about
it,
and
you
would
not
go
in
and
file
the
thing
asking
for
a
determination
unless
you
felt
that
was
such
a
marginal
case
that
you
had
to
do
that
to
protect
yourself.
but
normally
you
would
feel
that
if
your
agreement
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
subject
to
the
commission's
power
to
modify,
the
substance
of,
to
approve,
disapprove,
regulate
after
the
fact,
second
guess
you,
you
would
vigorously
resist
that.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
you
would
not
file
it
in
the
normal
course.
you
take
your
chances.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
need
not
have
been
filed
in
the
first
place.
that
is
correct
even
it
has
been
physically
filed,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
oh
no,
no
i
think
this
court
has
made
that
pretty
clear,
jewel
tea,
connell,
make
pretty
clear
that
the
labor
boards.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well,
i
think
depend
upon,
no
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
if
i
did.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
question,
i
mean,
for
example
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
the
dispute
over
the
container
freight
stuffing
agreement,
as
the
court
may
be
aware
this
is
a
monumental
subject
of
labor
strife
on
both
coasts.
the
issue
whether
teamsters
or
longshoremen
stuff
of
dock
containers
it
has
been
a
subject
of
very
critical
recent
concerns
involved
in
a
tangential
where
it
was
involved
in
this
case.
that
could
very
well
have
been
a
matter
under
the
commissions
criteria
that
could
have
gotten
the
maritime
commission
into
the
act.
in
that
case
the
non
member
ports
and
more
particularly
cordage
companies
or
other
off
docks
stuffers
chose
to
deal
with
the
matter
through
a
combination
of
the
antitrust
courts
by
filing
a
complaint
and
through
nlrb.
it
happened
that
that
particular
dispute
mr.
chief
justice
was
resolved
by
the
nlrb.
they
said
it
was
hot
cargo
clause
and
knocked
it
out.
one
of
the
problems
we
have
here
is
potentially,
if
we
have
the
maritime
commission
in
this
act,
we
have
the
nlrb
which
proved
itself
capable
of
handling
the
container
freight
station
stuffing
disputes,
we
have
the
antitrust
courts
who
have
to
resolve
pennington
jewel
tea
type
challenges
and
now
we
would
also
have
the
maritime
commission
apparently
under
some
kind
of
shipping
act
standards
and
that
is
very
very
messy
and
undesirable
way,
i
submit
to
you
to
go
about
handling
this
dispute.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme
and
one
of
the
reasons
as
a
practical
matter
where
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
is
that,
in
the
case
of
section
15
unlike
the
other
statutes,
you
referred
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
you
have
a
pre
implementation
approval
requirement
and
i
said
to
the
chief
justice
that
in
the
normal
course,
if
you
wish
to
resist
maritime
commission
jurisdiction
you
would
want
to
take
the
position,
it
was
not
subject
and
you
are
not
handing
it
over
for
filing
and
some
kind
of
an
approval
but
as
a
practical
matter
what
if
you
have
one
that
is
fairly
close
to
all
fours.
let
us
say
with
one
where
the
maritime
commission
asserted
jurisdiction,
as
it
did
for
example
in
the
boston
case.
now,
there
as
a
collective
bargaining
group
labor
and
management
you
are
in
the
position
of
having
negotiated
agreement
at
the
eleventh
hour
perhaps
with
the
strike
pending
and
you
are
subject
to
a
statute
there
where
if
the
commission
has
at
least
asserting
jurisdiction,
you
are
facing
possible
penalties
of
a
$1000
a
day
per
member
for
failing
to
fail
the
thing
even
apart
from
whether
it
is
approvable.
this
is
not
quite
what
you
have
asked
but
in
my
opinion
that
is
very
seriously
inconsistent
with
the
policies,
labor
policies
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
that
antitrust
courts
get
in
to
this
particular
act.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
oh
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
as
between
the
nlrb
and
the
courts,
there
may
be
shared
jurisdiction
that
is
to
say,
if
it
comes
up
if
the
issue
comes
up
in
a
pennington
context
with
an
antitrust
complaint,
jewel
tea,
connel,
make
clear
that
the
anti
trust
court
is
to
resolve
that
labor
questions
inherent
in
resolving
the
labor
exception
dispute.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well
i
suppose
yo
can
if
this
court
says
so
that
what
we
have
live
with
somehow,
but
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
sense.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
that
is
precisely
my
point.
i
do
not
think
that
it
does
makes
does
not
makes
sense
to
have
three
cooks
stirring
this
particular
pot
and
it
is
a
difficult,
difficult
pot.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
if
i
had
my
brothers
and
i
were
arguing
the
allen
bradley
or
perhaps
a
better
case,
the
pennington
case.
i
might
have
very
well
argued
otherwise.
it
is
too
late
to
argue
that.
i
think
there
are
obvious
difficulties
with
but
there
is
one
thing
the
court
did
make
clear
and
i
find
it
very
hard
to
argue
with
and
pennington
and
connell
and
allen
bradley.
that
is,
that
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
a
collision
between
two
national
policies,
by
the
way,
this
is
frequently
talked
about
as
an
antitrust
exemption
or
it
is
a
labor
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
a
short
hand
phrase
if
i
may
so
submit
for
describing
a
larger
jurisprudential
process
which
involves
the
weighing
of
two
statutory
policies,
national
policies
of
equal
weight.
we
call
it
a
labor
exemption,
i
have
used
the
term
in
my
briefs
too.
it
is
not
an
exemption,
it
is
a
jurisprudential
process
of
weighing,
conflicting
statutory
policies,
and
i
cannot
quarrel
with
this
court's
decisions.
i
think
they
are
right.
when
you
say
that
when
that
happens
the
proper
form
to
do
that
is
a
court.
the
worst
form
of
all
is
for
an
agency
that
has
no
jurisdiction
over
either
the
labor
or
the
antitrust
questions
which
is
what
the
fmc's
claim
is.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
its
jurisdiction
under
the
shipping
act.
let
us
face
reality,
the
job
in
the
maritime
commission
and
the
reason
for
the
shipping
act
is
to
grant
antitrust
exemptions
for
steamship
rate
making
conferences
which
are
otherwise
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
its
stock
and
trade
is
to
review
agreements
that
are
on
their
face,
per
se
violations,
no
antitrust
issues
presented
there
as
an
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
alright,
in
the
sense,
that
is
correct.
in
a
sense
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
in
this,
well,
in
the
sense
that
the
maritime
commission
grants
an
exemption,
it
has
to
take
note
of
the
fact
of
the
antitrust
violation
in
the
first
place.
what
i
am
saying
is
its
simplistic
kind
of
an
antitrust
jurisdiction,
the
commission
does
not
administer
the
antitrust
laws.
it
ministers
the
shipping
act
which
is
an
exception
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
yes.
one
would
suppose
that.
it
must
come
as
something
of
a
surprise
to
the
court
to
hear
the
industry
group,
trying
to
explain
to
the
court
why
we
do
not
have
this
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
why
we
do
not
have
this
and
enforce
this.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
i
guess,
what
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
the
commission
will
do
it
in
a
simplistic
way.
let
me
just
back
up
a
second,
mr.
justice
white.
the
problem
here,
i
do
not
think
is
what
agreements
the
commission
will
or
will
not
approve
in
the
larger
sense.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
the
problem
is
who
makes
the
determination
of
whether
a
labor
exemption
applies
or
not.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
exactly.
let
me,
give
you
some
reality.
we
have
a
two
hundred
page
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union
industry
wide.
let
us
not
fool
ourselves,
every
section
of
this
agreement
affects
competition
in
some
fashion
or
another.
you
do
not
have
industry
wide
bargaining
without
having
effects
on
competition.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
that
is
right,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
commission
is
going
to
have
jurisdiction
over
agreements
which
affect
competition
or
which
have
some
affect
on
outsiders,
then
we
are
talking
about
having
the
commission,
the
agency
which
is
least
qualified
to
understand
the
labor
implications
of
this
agreement.
passing
on
the
labor
exemption
question
and
i
just
do
not
think
that
it
is
right
or
it
makes
any
sense.
no
one
is
hurt
by
every
other
industry
in
this
country.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
oh
one
might
have.
but
i
have
been
an
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
last
desperation
kind
of
defense.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
not
at
all
your
honor.
if
under
the
carnation
case,
carnation
against
westbound
conference.
this
court
ruled
that
when
an
agreement
has
not
received
the
approval
of
the
maritime
commission,
a
trouble
damage
action
can
be
pursued
in
the
antitrust
court.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction.
and
it
was
a
common
sense
kind
of
a
ruling
and
so
if
the
attack
you
are
talking
about
has
been
mounted
against
a
collective
bargain
agreement
that
has
not
been
submitted
voluntarily
to
the
commission
and
receive
the
approval
antitrust
exemption
rubber
stamp,
then
there
is
nothing
to
the
submit
to
the
commission
carnation
tell
us
it
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
antitrust
laws.
it
is
too
late.
now,
if
the
agreement
has
been
submitted
to
the
maritime
commission
and
given
an
approval
stamp
that
is
the
end
of
the
line.
but
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is,
let
us
assume
the
egregious
agreement
kind
of
agreement,
let
us
assume
that
pma
had
agreed
with
union
to
do
some
kind
of
pennington
act
where
we
agreed
with
union
let
us
put
somebody
out
of
business
and
he
is
the
trouble
maker,
he
talking
all
our
business,
let
us
put
him
out
of
business,
let
get
rid
of
it.
right
point
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
let
us
assume,
further
we
filed
it
with
the
maritime
commission
which
gotten
the
approval,
stamped
the
antitrust
exemption
stamp.
now
what
happens
--perhaps
on
the
interim
basis
as
the
government
suggests,
we
do.
i
must
say
i
that
might
be
very
nice
for
some
people
in
some
instances,
but
it
is
a
pretty
hard
thing
for
the
fellow
that
is
driven
to
the
wall.
he
has
denied
his
antitrust
remedy.
i
do
not
think
as
matter
of
policy
that
is
what
congress
intended
in
section
15.
rate
agreements
--
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
i
am
not
interested
in
vindicating
their
rights
what
i
am
saying
is
as
matter
of
policy
i
do
not
think
agreements,
labor
agreements
of
this
kind
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
wanted
or
that
the
industry
really
wants.
to
be
within
the
antitrust
exception,
congress
did
not
advert
to
labor
agreements
when
they
created
the
antitrust
exemption,
they
created
it
for
steamship
rate
conferences
not
labor
agreements.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
oh!
no
not
all.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
there
may
very
well
be
an
antitrust
problem
what
i
am
saying
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
i
would
rather
take
my
risks
having
the
federal
court
whether
there
is
labor
exemption
or
not.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well
i
must
tell
you
that
there
–
we
do
not
live
in
the
choice
between
two
perfect
world
and
we
do
not
live
in
the
choice
between
heaven
and
hell
but
making
relative
decision
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
is
it
not
really
a
judicial
function
and
let
us
consider
one
other
mr.
justice
white
your
point
reminds
me
of
some
thing
that
and
i
think
is
important
here.
the
commission's
argument
to
this
court
is,
that
if
it
is
the
proper
agency
or
forum
so
as
to
speak
to
decide
the
labor
exemption
question
the
consequence
they
say
of
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeal
can
only
review
the
commission's
determination
for
abusive
discretion.
and
since
the
labor
exemption
question
is
obviously
a
judgmental
policy
kind
of
point
what
they
are
really
telling
you
is
that
the
commission
decision
on
this
subject
should
not
really
be
reviewable.
it
is
something
close
to
saying
that
the
commissions
decision
are
not
properly
reviewable
except
for
abusive
discretion
whatever
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeal.
well
in
the
allen
bradley
case
this
court
in
reviewing
the
district
court's
decision
said
it
is
up
to
us
make
this
decision
we
must
decide
it
here.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
that
is
absolutely
right
and
the
reason,
the
reason
that
is
the
case
is
that
you
do
not
want
federal
maritime
commission
which
is
not
a
judicial
agency.
it
is
shipping
act
agency
deciding
questions
like
whether
the
bargaining
is
in
good
faith,
whether
it
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
etcetera
etcetera,
as
the
court
inevitably
have
to
do
in
every
one
of
these
labor
antitrust
cases.
as
subsidiary
questions
to
the
ultimate
resolution,
it
is
the
wrong
forum.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
i
think
it
is
conceivable,
but
i
guess
what
i
have
to
say
is
to
that
it
is
probably
unlikely
and
the
main
point
is
that
congress
did
not
considered
that,
that
was
the
kind
of
agreement
that
should
be
able
to
get
an
antitrust
exemption.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well
it--
any
antitrust
violation
that
is
subject
to
section
15.
mr.
r.
frederic
fisher
well
i
guess
what
i
come
down
towards
saying
this.
the
standards
of
section
15
taken
loosely
can
apply
to
almost
any
industry
wide
collective
bargaining
provision
that
there
is,
in
the
maritime
industry
that
is
subjected
to
the
act.
if
you
are
going--
you
just
simply
have
make
a
decision
as
to
who
is
going
to
decide
these
questions
and
if
the
commission
is
going
to
decide
it,
it
might
be
nice
for
us
to
say,
might
be
nice
for
us
that
we
have
a
nice
place
to
go
to
get
an
exemption
that
would
be
handy
at
times
i
suppose,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
practical
consequences
is
you
got
the
maritime
commission
on
the
backyard
of
your
labor
relations,
second
guessing
you
they
do
not
know
anything
about
labor,
they
do
not
anything
about
labor
questions,
and
the
disadvantage
so
vastly
out
weighs
the
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
safe
heaven
from
the
antitrust
laws
granted
by
a
section15
approval,
that
we
have
made
our
choice
the
other
way.
