you
are
afraid,
you
are
afraid
that
the
commission
may
not
do
it
in
a
simplistic
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
a
choice
between
two
evils.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
are
not
in
the
same
unit
though
i
mean
if
you
went
to
the
labor
board
and
to
be
certified,
who
would
not
be
certified--
the
units
certified
would
not
include
these
non
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
have
the
united
states
here,
this
mr
solicitor
general
represents
the
united
states,
i
suppose
and
the
department
of
justice
is
responsible
for
administering
antitrust
laws,
represents
other
agencies
of
the
united
states
and
i
take
it
that
united
state's
submission
is
that
the
antitrust
issue
--
they
are
preferably
willing
to
have
the
antitrust
issue
and
the
labor
issue
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
maritime
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
requires
that
there
be
filed
with
the
federal
maritime
commission,
all
agreements
between
carriers
that
regulate,
destroy
or
prevent
competition.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
here
that
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
regardless
of
its
impact
between
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
and
a
union
need
be
filed
under
section
15
and
in
any
event
(inaudible)
holds
that
a
particular
agreement
in
this
case
need
not
be
filed.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
disagree
on
both
the
counts
and
we
have
filed
an
opinion
explaining
why.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
