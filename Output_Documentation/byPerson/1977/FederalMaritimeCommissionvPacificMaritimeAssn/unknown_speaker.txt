unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
you
referred
to
nonmember
ports
and
that
my
understanding
is
that
the
pma
consist
of
steam
ship
companies,
terminal
operators,
stevedores
and
so
forth,
when
you
say
nonmember
ports
are
there
entire
ports
which
have
none
of
those
–
who
are
members
of
the
pma?
unknown
speaker
an
are
they
primarily
publicly
operated
ports?
unknown
speaker
it
mean
there
public
bodies
operating.
unknown
speaker
was
the
dismissal
on
merits?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
statutory
labor
exemption
in
the
federal
maritime
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
am
i
right
the
commission
has
not
yet
either
approved
or
disapproved
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
when
the
commission
asked
whether
the
agreement
is
entitled
to
a
labor
exemption,
even
though
it
must
be
filed
under
section
fifteen,
if
they
say
that
it
does,
is
that
just
the
equivalent
of
approving
it.
unknown
speaker
it
does
mean
that
the
commission
will
not
proceed
it
to
deal
with
antitrust
considerations
in
the
matter
because
they
think
that
under
our
cases
or
under
the
court's
cases
whatever
effect
on
competition
is
covered
by
the
“labor
exemption”.
unknown
speaker
but
it
also
keeps
them
from
disapproving
it.
unknown
speaker
keeps
them
from
disapproving
it,
although
that
otherwise
they
might
disprove
it
on
the
grounds
if
it
effect
on
competition.
unknown
speaker
oh
i
understand
-
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
say
that
the
agreement
is
not
entitled
to
a
“labor
exemption”
then
they
are
going
to
decide
whether
they
would
approve
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
answered
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
just
saying
that
the
agreement
is
not
entitled
to
“labor
exemption”
is
not
equivalent
of
disapproving
it.
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
still
approve
it
and
thereby
insulated
from
antitrust.
unknown
speaker
and
say
that
this
is
essential
for
the
running
of
this
steamship
business.
unknown
speaker
and
if
its-
if
there
is
a
finding
contrary
to
this
case
that
there
is
a
“labor
exemption”
then
what
follows,
the
commission
--
unknown
speaker
say
as
you
do
not
need
to
file
it.
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
not
approve
it.
unknown
speaker
you
must
say
then,
because
the
“labor
exemption”
is
applicable
here
and
this
is
not
agreement
that
need
to
be
filed.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
their
order.
in
finding
a
“labor
exemption”
then
what
does
the
commission
do?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event
they
do
not
report
to
approve
it
and
the
agreement
that
is
still
open
to
attack
in
the
courts
as
a
violation..
unknown
speaker
its
not
approved
but
it
certainly
has
been
disapproved.
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
a
“labor
exemption”
you
do
not
need
to
file
this
for
approval,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
effectively
takes
the
anti-trust
issue
out
the
administrative
process.
unknown
speaker
and
puts
it
back
potentially
in
the
court
so
you
must
assume
--.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
do
not
purport
to
decide..
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
so
ruled.
unknown
speaker
it
may
have
been
un-filed
sure
but
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
draws
on
allan
bradley
and
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
which
exonerated
sudden
activities
of
labor
unions
from
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
the
body
of
law
upon
which
the
commission
evidently
draws.
unknown
speaker
they
cannot
because
of
the
antitrust
laws,
they
are
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws,
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
the
commission
draws
on
our
labor
cases
or
the
court
labor
cases
is
because
it
is
charged
with
considering
antitrust
considerations
in
approving
agreements
that
have
to
be
filed
and
there
is
in
turn
a
pro
tem
or
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
certain
types
of
labor
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
not
draw
on
our
labor
cases,
it
draws
on
antitrust..
unknown
speaker
are
you
or
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
defend
the
correctness
and
wisdom
and
accuracy
of
the
boards
or
the
commission
so
called
distillation
in
these
case.
unknown
speaker
mr
fisher,
what
happens
as
a
consequence
of
a
commission
determination
that
the
agreement
is
within
the
subject
or
within
the
--
is
exempt
because
of
the
labor
exemptions
does
it
simple
send
the
agreement
back
and
say
because
of
this
finding
it
was
not
necessary
to
file
this
agreement
--
unknown
speaker
you
will
say
we
will
not
file
it.
unknown
speaker
and
the
commission
finding
that
the
an
agreement
is
within
the
labor
exemption
leads
to
a
commission
holding
at
least
implicit
if
not
explicit,
this
agreement
need
not
have
been
filed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
then
that
the
labor
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
what
you
said
sounded
as
though
you
were
implying
that
only
labor
board
would
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
basically
in
any
one
of
those
forms
the
way
something
starts
out
is
by
plaintiff
having
standing
coming
in
and
challenging
and
the
decision
that
forum
has
to
make
and
if
its
appealed,
the
courts
on
appeal
have
to
make
is
whether
the
federal
maritime
commission
or
the
nlrb
or
the
courts
had
jurisdiction
and
i
suppose
just
the
fact
that
more
than
one
of
them
might
have
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
particular
complaint,
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
we
must
construe
these
various
acts
so
that
if
one
form
has
jurisdiction
the
other
does
not?
unknown
speaker
why
cannot
you
say
equally
consistently
that
fmc
and
the
courts
have
shared
jurisdiction
if
it
is
basically
a
maritime
question
the
fmc
should
resolve
it.
unknown
speaker
if
it
does
not
make
any
sense,
we
should
not
say
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
two
cooks
can
stir
it.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
it
has
no
jurisdiction
over
antitrust
questions?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
is
the
jurisdiction
then
with
respect
to
anti
trusted
issues.
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
say
it
does
not
because
it
exempts
--
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
say
anything
that
is
a
clear
piece
of
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
you
would
be
delighted
if
it
took
this
agreement
and
exempted
it.
unknown
speaker
why
we
do
not
want
to
be
exempted?
unknown
speaker
no
i
--
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
in
your
words,
whether,
who
should
decide,
whether
or
not
this
agreement
violates
antitrust
laws.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
we
have
been
through
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fisher,
supposing
that
trouble
damage
act
has
been
filed
against
the
industry
on
a
pennington
theory,
in
a
federal
court,
would
it
not
have
been
an
entirely
proper
defense
for
you
to
assert
it
as
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction.
the
matter
should
have
first
been
presented
to
the
maritime
commission.
would
that
not
have
been
a
classic
defense?
unknown
speaker
or
if
it
were
clear
antitrust
questions.
say,
i
know
--
you
do
not
think
(inaudible)
applies
but
say
the
agreement
had
said,
we
will
not
deal
with
companies
that
do
not
agree
to
the
rates
fixed
by
the
conference
or
something
like
that.
you
would
clear
in
a
right
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
would
not
that
clearly
be
a
case
that
you
would
--
if
you
were
sued
in
from
the
antitrust
court,
you
would
say
that
were
federal
maritime
commission
first.
unknown
speaker
last
desperation,
it
is
almost
routine
in
this
industry
it
is
?
unknown
speaker
it
is
so
puzzling,
as
you
seem
to
be
most
interested
in
vindicating
the
rights
of
those
who
want
to
disagree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
well
you
use
terms
in
a
very
simple
way.
but
agreements
are
complex
things
and
if
they
have
anti
competitive
consequences,
you
gave
an
example
yourself,
you
say
if
you
drove
these
ports
out
of
business
there
would
be
clearly
antitrust
problem.
but
if
you
just
double
their
costs
there
is
no
antitrust
problem--
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
that
why
it
is
quite
that
right.
unknown
speaker
you
would
rather
take
your
risks
and
have
the
jury
decided
then
the
maritime
--
unknown
speaker
your
suggestion
is
that
the
maritime
commission
may
not
really
know
what
it
is
doing
in
this
area
but
you
assume
that
some
500
federal
judges
are
really
experts
in
how
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
labor
laws
ought
to
be
meshed
in
maritime
industry,
that
is
a
pretty
good
mouthful,
itself.
unknown
speaker
your
submission
is
that
there
is
no,
no
part
of
any
imaginable
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
should
ever
have
to
filed
with
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fisher,
is
it
conceivable
that
there
might
be
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
involved
the
violation
of
antitrust
laws,
just
a
patent
violation,
the
pennington
type
case,
which
would
nevertheless
be
in
the
interest
of
industry
–
in
public
interest
for
shipping
act
reason,
is
that
conceivable
and
therefore
there
should
be
an
exemption.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
surely
did,
any
violation,
the
antitrust
law
can
get
the
exempted
under
section
16
and
the
section
15.
unknown
speaker
sure,
if
it
fits
any
of
these
definitions,
regulation,
preventing
or
destroying
competition
and
the
like
which
is
almost
another
way
of
describing
an
agreement
and
restraining
the
--.
unknown
speaker
how
would
this
kind
of
issue
come
before
the
labor
board?
i
can
see
that
can
arise
in
a
federal
court
and
antitrust
trouble
damage
action
but
how
does
a
labor
board
get
involved
in
the
kind
of
question
as
whether
this
collective-bargaining
agreement
violates
the
antitrust
laws
or
anti-competitive
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
could
the
ports
here
who
filed
the
charge
with
the
labor
board
claiming
that
they
were
somehow
hurt
by
this
collective-
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
under
what
procedure
i
do
not
quite
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
agreement
itself
would
be
an
8e
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
prevail,
i
take
it
the
antitrust
cases
if
there
are
some
pending
or
just
go
forward
and
or
some
others
will
be
filed
and
you
will
have
this
antitrust
issue
decided
in
them,
in
the
courts
and
very
likely
in
no
part
of
the
issue
will
get
before
the
labor
board.
unknown
speaker
but
we
understand
that
but
also
say
that
whatever
antitrust
issue
there
is
here
should
be
first
decided
by
the
maritime
commission,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
antitrust
division
maybe
wholly
foreclosed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
just
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
mr.
fischer
i
think,
stressed
the
pre
implementation
approval
requirement
and
the
statute
as
i
recall
as
an
exception
for
rate
agreements
which
may
receive
interim
approval.
is
there
a
statutory
authority
for
interim
approval
of
an
agreement
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
status?
i
just
want
to
know
about
the
agreement
in
question
here
about
the
provisional
agreements
in
question
here?
