mr.
friedman,
is
it
not
when
you
talk
of
“labor
exemption”
in
this
context,
you
are
talking
about
the
exemption
from
the
requirements
of
the
“shipping
act”
rather
than
the
anit-trust.
what
that
means
if
there
is
an
“labor
exemption”
and
you
are
using
the
term,
it
means
that
the
agreement
need
not
have
been
filed
pursuant
to
section
fifteen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
so
called
“labor
exemption”
the
commission
draws
not
on
“shipping
act”
cases
but
on
the
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
including
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
it
is
little
oversimplified
if
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
any
event,
in
this
case,
the
commission
--
there
was
no
so
called
“labor
exemption”
and
right
here
wrongly
that
is
what
is
found.
your
brothers
on
the
other
side,
their
first
position
is
that
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
subject
to
section
fifteen
requirement
of
filing.
whether
or
not
there
is
a
“labor
exemption”
within
the
boards
criteria
is
really
irrelevant
to
that
basic
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
similar
regulation
variation
in
the
cib
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
be
clearly,
grossly
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
