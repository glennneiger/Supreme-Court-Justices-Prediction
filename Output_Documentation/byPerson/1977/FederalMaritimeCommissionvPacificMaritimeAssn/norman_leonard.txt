mr.
norman
leonard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
focus
on
the
questions
which
have
been
raised
in
the
preceding
arguments
from
the
point
of
the
labor
organization
involved
representing
the
as
i
do
ilwu.
it
was
my
principal
concern
in
coming
here
from
the
west
coast
to
assure
the
court
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
union's
interest
in
this
non
member
participation
clause.
perhaps
if
have
read
the
the
reply
brief,
the
solicitor
filed
before
i
left
for
san
francisco,
i
might
have
saved
myself
a
trip.
because
on
page
six
of
this
brief
and
addressing
the
question
of
whether
the
union
has
that
interest
in
the
integrity
in
work
of
attorneys
and
registered
work
force
and
in
the
fringe-benefits
of
the
agreement
covers,
the
solicitor
says
there
is
no
question.
i
am
quoting
him
now
that
the
union
has
such
an
interest,
indeed
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
union
unilaterally
could
demand
from
non
members
of
pma
whose
employee
represents
the
same
terms
as
that
undertook
to
require
under
this
very
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
point
number
one,
with
that
concession
by
the
solicitor,
it
is
clear
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
labor
contract
with
the
legitimate
trade
union
interest
which
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
labor
exemption.
the
solicitor
however
goes
on
to
argue
that
because
as
he
asserts
and
he
has
asserted
in
his
own
argument
to
this
court.
the
agreement
allegedly
imposes
conditions
on
employees
of
members
outside
the
bargaining
units,
it
therefore
falls
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
connell
and
pennington.
the
problem
however
is,
that
this
case
on
its
facts
is
different
from
kernel
and
pennington,
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
is
a
work
force
of
employees
who
are
all
in
one
bargaining
unit
and
who
sometimes
work
for
pma
and
who
very
rarely
and
occasionally
work
for
the
non
members.
the
union
represents
all
of
the
--
it
is
not
as
though,
the
united
automobile
workers
in
the
ford
motor
company
negotiated
a
contract
to
impose
conditions
on
priceless
workers,
for
example,
we
have
a
single
solitary
work
force
on
the
west
coast
who
sometimes
work
for
pma--
