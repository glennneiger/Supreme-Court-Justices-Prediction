justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
class
action
suit
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
merits
of
the
case
are
not
before
us,
the
case
presents
a
recurring
question
as
to
which
party
the
class
action
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
should
bear
the
expense
of
compiling
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class.
although
civil
procedure
rule
23
deals
specifically
and
in
detail
with
class
actions,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
general
discovery
rules
are
applicable.
its
decision
would
require
the
class
action
defendant
not
only
to
assist
in
compiling
the
list
but
also
to
bear
in
this
case
the
$16,000
expense
incident
there
too.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
reasons
set
forth
in
the
court's
opinion.
we
hold
that
rule
23d,
not
to
discovery
rules
is
applicable.
we
further
hold
that
although
the
district
court
does
have
some
discretion
in
allocating
the
cost
of
compiling
the
names
and
addresses
of
class
members,
that
discretion
was
abused
in
this
case.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
