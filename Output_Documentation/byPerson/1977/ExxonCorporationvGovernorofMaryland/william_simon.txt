mr.
william
simon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
paragraphs
b
and
c
of
chapter
854
of
the
maryland
statutes
to
which
i
would
devote
20
minute
and
paragraph
d
of
the
same
statute
to
which
i
would
devote
10
minutes
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
respectively.
paragraph
b
of
the
maryland
act
provides
that
after
july
1,
1974,
no
producer
or
refiner
may
open
a
new
service
station
in
maryland
operated
by
company
employees
and
paragraph
c
provides
that
after
july
1,
1975,
no
producer
or
refiner
may
operate
an
existing
service
station
by
company
employees.
as
of
july
1,
1974
only
6%,
233
out
of
3800
of
the
service
stations
in
maryland
were
company
operated
and
only
197
of
those
by
refiners.
no
crude
oil
has
ever
been
produced
in
maryland
and
it
is
unlikely
that
any
ever
will
be.
there
is
no
refinery
in
maryland
and
the
state's
ecology
procedures
are
such
that
it
is
unlikely
that
there
will
be
any
refinery
in
maryland
at
least
in
this
century.
and
thus
all
gasoline
sold
in
maryland
is
imported
into
the
state
in
interstate
commerce
and
all
refiner
marketers
in
maryland
are
out
of
state
firms.
to
make
the
purpose
of
paragraphs
b
and
c
crystal
clear,
in
1975
the
legislature
enacted
an
amendment
to
the
statute
which
expressly
provided
that
all
service
stations
must
be
operated
by
dealers.
the
statute's
legislative
history,
the
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
and
the
briefs
in
this
court,
all
make
crystal
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
insulate
major
brand
dealers
from
the
competition
of
more
aggressive
lower
priced
merchants
and
to
ensure
that
maryland
motorists
and
those
who
travel
into
the
state
will
not
receive
the
benefits
of
service
stations
that
are
company
operated
and
are
price
cutters
who
sell
at
lower
prices
and
do
eliminate
that
competition
from
the
service
station
business
in
maryland.
the
two
alleged
purposes
which
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
gave
to
sustain
the
validity
of
the
statute
are
first
that
it
will
prevent
monopoly,
although
they
concede
that
this
service
station
business
is
highly
competitive
and
many
maryland
as
well
as
federal
laws
already
prohibit
monopolies
in
any
line
of
commerce
and
secondly
that
the
statute
would
permit
the
fair
and
equitable
rationing
of
gasoline
in
the
event
of
emergencies.
although
paragraph
f
of
this
very
act
so
provides
and
in
1973
the
congress
passed
the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
under
which
the
federal
government
from
that
day
to
this
has
allocated
gasoline
supplies
to
service
stations.
mr.
william
simon
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
as
will
point
out
later,
the
number
of
service
stations
of
any
kind
and
all
kinds
whether
or
not
this
act
prevails
will
continue
to
decline
because
the
economics
of
high
prices
in
gasoline
going
from
the
$0.20,
$0.25
range
of
the
50s
to
the
$0.60
and
$0.65
range
of
current
prices
makes
it
essential
that
we
have
high
volume
stations
that
can
operate
more
economically
and
not
have
the
inefficient
marginal
stations.
so
there
will
be
a
diminution
of
stations
no
matter
what.
mr.
william
simon
first
from
the
point
of
view
of
he
who
wants
to
compete
for
the
motorist
business
and
secondly
for
the
motorist
who
wants
to
get
the
benefits
of
competition
in
the
sale
of
his
gasoline.
mr.
william
simon
well
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
statute
which
burdens
interstate
commerce
will
be
sustained
only
if
the
local
benefits
are
so
persuasive
and
so
important
as
to
override
the
restraint
on
interstate
commerce
which
they
impose
and
we
submit
that
this
mere
matter
of
fair
allocation
which
is
already
being
done
by
the
federal
government
and
preventing
monopoly
which
is
already
prevented
by
many
statutes
does
not
justify
the
restraint
on
completion
which
this
statute
imposes.
and
may
i
add
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
suggest
for
one
instant
that
there
will
ever
come
a
time
when
independent
major
brand
service
station
dealers
will
go
out
of
business.
the
fact
is
there
are
many
people,
i
might
add
including
me,
who
would
rather
pay
a
higher
price
for
the
extra
service
and
the
personal
attention
you
get
in
a
conventional
major
brand
station.
but
there
are
also
a
lot
of
people
who
would
rather
forgo
those
services
and
go
into
a
low
price
no
service
station
and
pump
their
own
gas
and
save
as
much
as
$0.8
a
gallon
and
what
we
advocate
is
that
free
competition
should
prevail,
let
the
motorist
make
the
choice
and
the
mix
of
how
many
of
each
there
will
be
will
be
decided
by
how
many
people
want
to
go
to
each
type
of
station.
mr.
william
simon
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
william
simon
no
mr.
chief
justice
the
motorist
may
not
know
it
but
the
large
share,
certainly
not
all
of
it
but
over
50%
of
the
price
cutting
gasoline
is
supplied
by
integrated
refiner
suppliers.
ashland
oil
is
one
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
ashland
sells
under
its
own
brand
in
its
home
state
area
of
kentucky,
but
in
maryland
it
sells
under
the
names
buy
low,
hi5,
payless,
redhead,
names
that
one
would
never
identify
with
the
ashland
company
and
those
stations
sell
on
a
purely
price
basis
saving
the
customer
a
great
deal
of
money.
the
undisputed
testimony
below
was
that
those
stations
can't
operate
unless
the
management
can
control
not
only
the
operations
of
the
station
but
the
price
because
price
is
their
key
factor
and
those
ashland
stations
under
those
brand
names
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
tell
him
exactly
how
to
run
it
so
as
to
achieve
all
of
the
economies
of
scale
and
tell
him
what
to
price.
mr.
william
simon
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
true
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
william
simon
sir?
mr.
william
simon
oh,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
secret
made
about
it
where
it
occurs,
there
is
no
secret
about
it
where
it
occurs.
one
of
our
problems
is
defining
exactly
just
what
is
a
major,
but
there
are
many
companies
that
i
think
everybody
would
call
majors
who
sell
50%
of
their
gasoline
for
resale
unbranded
and
the
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
no
sir.
but
it
is
in
the
record
that
ashland
which
has
five
refineries
around
the
country
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
there
are
37
refiners
in
the
united
states
who
sell
gasoline
through
service
stations
that
they
control
and
give
little
or
no
service,
pump
your
own
gasoline,
you
get
a
low
price.
five
of
those
people
do
business
in
maryland
and
would
be
driven
out
of
the
state
by
this
law
and
the
other
32
foreclosed
from
maryland
and
the
best
example
i
can
give
is
the
hudson
stations.
there
are
315
hudson
stations
in
the
united
states
in
36
states,
five
of
them
in
maryland.
hudson
is
shown
by
this
record
to
be
one
of
the
vigorous
price
cutters
in
the
country.
the
state
in
it's
brief
to
this
court
refers
to
hudson
as
one
of
the
pure
independent
marketers
and
yet
since
the
trial
of
this
case
hudson
has
acquired
a
refinery
and
now
that
they
have
enhanced
their
position
to
compete
as
mary
hudson,
the
president
of
that
company,
testified
when
she
appeared
on
the
witness
stand
in
this
case,
she
said
when
i
buy
that
refinery
if
this
law
is
upheld
i'm
going
to
be
driven
from
the
state
and
so
you
have
the
most
vigorous
competitor
in
the
country
in
the
selling
of
-
low
price
gasoline
who
because
she
was
successful
enough
to
integrate
backwards
and
get
a
refinery
is
now
driven
from
maryland.
mr.
william
simon
we
say
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no
more
then
north
carolina
was
entitled
to
prefer
north
carolina
apples
over
washington
apples
in
the
hunt
case.
mr.
william
simon
no
but
maryland
is
preferring
maryland
dealers,
the
pinch
on
competition,
the
squeeze
on
interstate
commerce
comes
at
he
retail
level
and
maryland
is
preferring
the
local
retailers
against
interstate
sellers
of
gasoline
at
retail.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
they
are
at
the
high
price
people.
the
local
retailer
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
man
who
sells
--
mr.
william
simon
i
can't
answer
your
question
yes
or
no
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
people
that
you
obviously
think
as
you
drive
down
the
street
as
an
individual
station
who
is
a
price
cutter
is
more
likely
then
not
a
part
of
a
large
chain.
for
example
i
would
assume
that
you
would
never
have
thought
that
a
buylow
station
or
a
redhead
station
on
new
york
avenue
here
just
beyond
the
bridge
is
a
station
owned
by
ashmond
oil
which
is
a
very
large
company
and
has
hundreds
of
stations
around
the
country
under
various
names
selling
low
priced
gasoline
with
minimum
service.
and
what
this
act
is
designed
to
drive
out
of
maryland
is
those
people
who
are
the
majority
of
what
you
had
described
as
the
independent,
there
independents
but
they
are
chains
of
independents
and
what
the
act
is
in
designed
to
protect
is
the
major
brand
dealer
who
sells
at
four
to
eight
cents
a
gallon
above
these
price
cutters,
selling
his
well
advertised
brand,
fixing
your
tire,
changing
your
sparkplugs,
giving
them
any
other
services
and
that
because
of
those
services
feeling
he's
entitled
to
a
higher
price
but
those
are
local
people
who
had
the
local
political
influence
that
permitted
--
that
resulted
in
this
statute
being
passed
--
mr.
william
simon
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
can
be
argued
that
shell
that
i
represent
and
axon
and
there
like
would
short
termed
be
benefited
by
driving
out
these
large
chains
of
price
cutters
and
i
think
in
one
sense
they
would.
they
would
also
be
disadvantaged
because
it's
important
to
them
to
be
able
to
innovate
with
new
types
of
stations,
automated
stations
and
the
many
other
kinds
of
stations
that
are
new
and
innovated.
but
the
real
reason
that
shell
and
axon
and
the
likes
of
them
oppose
this
statute
is
that
this
industry
is
over
regulated
now.
there
is
relatively
little
area
of
competition
left
and
what
completion
remains
we
want
to
preserve
because
we
can
live
with
vigorous
competition
but
if
regulation
gets
to
the
point
where
there
is
not
competition,
no
oil
company
in
my
judgment
will
survive
as
a
free
enterprise
company
and
we'll
have
public
utility
regulation.
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir.
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
would
say
that
they
would
be
--
mr.
william
simon
i
think
not.
liquor
is
in
particularly
different
question
because
the
amendment
which
repealed
the
volstead
act
gave
the
states
a
great
deal
of
power
over
local
distribution
of
whisky.
indeed
the
constitution
under
that,
i
forget
the
amendment,
but
it's
the
amendment
that
repealed
the
18th
amendment
even
gives
them
the
power
to
have
local
option
with
one
county
prohibiting
sale
all
together
and
another
county
permitting
at
only
at
tables
and
another
county
state
monopolies
and
so
i
think
that
then
liquor
situation
would
not
be
applicable
and
you
could
not
have
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
only
the
fact
is
that
less
than
5%
of
the
major
oil
company
stations
in
maryland
are
company
operated
and
95%
of
them
are
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir
but
it
burdens
into
respect
mr.
justice
white.
one
out
of
state
refiner
marketers
will
be
denied
access
to
this
market.
mr.
william
simon
the
maryland
market
they
will
be
prohibitive
from
selling
at
retail
in
maryland.
mr.
william
simon
because
it
denies
them
access
that
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
we
all
--
mr.
william
simon
certainly
it
affects
interstate
commerce
and
–-
mr.
william
simon
well
there
are
many
sherman
act
cases
involving
retail
sales
of
gasoline
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
--
mr.
william
simon
well
if
the
burden
on
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
no
sir,
but
may
i
give
you
this
example.
just
last
week
in
raymond
transport
verses
rice,
this
court
held
that
wisconsin
could
not
constitutionally
limit
raymond
transport
to
55-foot
transports.
now
there
isn't
any
question
they
could
use
55-foot
transports
to
go
through
wisconsin.
wisconsin
didn't
say
you
got
to
stay
out
of
the
state,
but
this
court
said
it
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
to
tell
them
they
couldn't
go
through
wisconsin
with
65-foot
transports
or
anything
over
55-foot
because
wisconsin
was
unable
to
show
any
local
benefits
that
outweighed
the
restraint
of
the
economies
of
operation
and
the
--
mr.
william
simon
if
you
mean
consumer
literally
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir.
the
shell
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir
this
law
relates
solely
to
dealers
your
honor.
mr.
william
simon
this
law
applies
solely
to
service
--
retail
service
stations.
mr.
william
simon
yes
it
but
the
law
does
not
prevent
it.
the
law
--
mr.
william
simon
it
burdens
--
it
burdens
interstate
commerce
mr.
justice
white
in
two
reasons,
in
two
ways;
one
it
prevents
on
out
of
state
refiner
from
operating
a
retail
gasoline
station
--
mr.
william
simon
and
selling
direct
to
the
consumer
and
secondly
it
dines
the
consumer
the
benefits
of
competition
furnished
to
him
by
out
of
state
refiners.
let
me
give
you
a
the
most
ridiculous
example.
under
this
law
sears
roebuck
will
continue
to
be
perfectly
free
to
have
a
gasoline
station
in
conjunction
with
a
sears
roebuck
store
selling
gasoline
at
retail,
but
montgomery
ward
will
be
prohibited
from
having
the
identical
facility
because
montgomery
ward
is
a
subsidiary
of
mobil
oil
company
and
therefore
montgomery
ward
can't
have
that
retail
station
in
front
of
their
store
but
sears
roebuck
can.
mr.
william
simon
exactly,
exactly
mr.
rehnquist
justice,
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better.
we
want
to
do
business
in
maryland
at
retail
on
the
same
basis
as
the
local
retail
dealers.
that's
exactly
what
we
want.
we
want
to
do
business
in
--
at
retail
on
the
same
basis
that
they
do
and
this
act
says
we
can't
do
it
just
--
mr.
william
simon
yeah
but
then
we
can't
do
business
at
retail.
it
denies
us
the
right
to
sell
gasoline
at
retail
to
motorists.
mr.
william
simon
yes
mr.
justice
white
because
--
mr.
william
simon
and
having
in
mind
that
there
are
no
refineries
in
maryland,
it's
all
out
of
state
gasoline,
having
in
mind
that
these
refiners
like
ashland
sell
a
very
substantial
part
of
their
refinery
runs
of
gasoline
through
their
own
retail
stations
on
a
basis
of
low
price.
and
they
outsell
these
major
brand
dealers
four
and
five
to
one
because
of
their
low
prices
and
this
law
would
say
you
got
to
get
out
of
the
state
and
you
either
close
down
that
station
or
lease
it
to
someone
and
have
no
control
over
the
manner
in
which
he
operates
it
and
we
say
that's
a
restraint
on
interstate
commerce
exactly
like
in
pike
versus
church,
bruce
church,
exactly
like
in
a
hunt
versus
washington
and
apple,
exactly
like
in
raymond
transport
versus
rice,
exactly
like
cottrell
versus
a&p,
all
very
recent
cases
of
this
court,
all
to
the
same
effect.
now
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
switch
to
paragraph
d
of
the
statute
which
we
attack
on
the
basis
of
its
being
repugnant
to
and
frustrating
sections
to
a
and
b
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
simon
no,
no
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
simon
yes
continental
relies
on
the
due
process
clause
but
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
and
their
basis
is
that
as
to
sea
which
applies
to
stations
in
already
existence.
they
say
if
you
don't
want
us
to
build
anymore,
why
we
can
live
that
but
if
you
--
want
us
to
tear
down
our
existing
stations
that
deprives
us
of
due
process.
that
is
i
think
another
way
of
saying
what
i've
said
under
the
commerce
clause
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
simon
thank
you
sir.
on
paragraph
d,
the
maryland
statute
provides
that
if
a
supplier
reduces
his
price
to
one
customer,
one
dealer
customer;
he
must
grant
that
price
reduction
to
every
dealer
in
the
state.
and
that
means
if
you
have
a
competitive
controversy
in
baltimore
which
requires
you
to
reduce
your
price
in
baltimore;
you
must
make
that
price
reduction
throughout
the
entire
state
of
maryland.
and
we
believe
that
to
require
a
supplier
to
make
a
state-wide
price
reduction,
if
he
grants
a
local
individual
price
reduction,
is
contrary
to
the
precompetitive
rights
which
this
court
has
held
a
seller
has
under
section
2(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
meet
competition
in
individual
competitive
situations
and
must
therefore
be
invalidated
under
the
doctrine
of
perez
versus
campbell
and
jones
versus
rath
packing
company.
the
act
is
due
to
section
d
also
is
in
conflict
with
section
2(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
makes
unlawful
price
discriminations
only
where
they
injure
competition.
this
requires
the
state-wide
lowering
of
price
without
regard
to
injury
to
competition
and
section
2(a)
makes
unlawful
a
primary
line
price
cut
which
injures
a
competitor
of
the
seller
which
is
likely
to
be
triggered
and
caused
when
we
reduce
our
price
state-wide
and
thereby
extend
a
baltimore
price
war
to
cumberland,
maryland
let's
say
where
there
had
been
no
price
war
previously.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
the
example
i
just
gave
--
mr.
william
simon
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
have
a
price
war
in
baltimore.
mr.
william
simon
well
you
have
two
problems
mr.
justice
stevens;
one
is
maryland
borders
the
district
of
columbia
--
virginia
--
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
i
am
talking
about
silver
spring
--
mr.
william
simon
there
are
typically
differentials,
but
where
a
price
war
gets
the
differential
to
six,
seven,
eight,
nine
cents
a
gallon,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
differential
that
is
typical
and
you
can
have
the
problem
of
a
differential
with
the
dealer
across
the
street
at
the
state
line
particularly
in
the
state
of
maryland
which
borders
so
many
states
and
where
there
are
so
many
cities
like
washington
and
wilmington
that
are
literally
across
the
street
from
maryland.
mr.
william
simon
well
i
must
confess
to
you
mr.
justice
stevens
that
i
am
positive
in
my
own
mind
that
the
authors
of
this
bill
intended
to
make
--
giving
a
price
assistance
to
a
dealer
so
costly
that
it
would
never
be
done.
mr.
william
simon
not
at
all.
it
is
contrary
to
the
philosophy
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
robinson-patman
act
in
standard
oil
case
--
mr.
william
simon
but
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
am
sure
you
know
that
this
court
has
many
times
sought
to
balance
the
anticompetitive
problems
of
robinson-patman
with
the
sherman
act.
and
this
court's
opinions
in
robinson-patman
have
sought
to
strike
a
fine
balance
between
the
anticompetitive
aspects
of
one
and
the
pro-competitive
aspects
of
the
other.
and
everything
this
court
has
done
in
that
regard
is
wiped
out
by
maryland
by
saying
we
just
aren't
going
to
have
competition
in
this
state
in
the
sale
of
gasoline.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
mr.
justice
burton's
opinion
in
the
first
standard
oil
case
that
it
would
not
construe
robinson-patman
as
permitting.
the
court
said
in
the
first
standard
oil
case
that
robinson-patman
was
intended
to
protect
competition,
not
competitors,
that
robinson-patman
was
intended
to
promote
competition,
not
prevent
competition,
that
robinson-patman
would
not
require
a
seller
to
ruinously
lose
his
biggest
customer
because
he
couldn't
meet
the
competition
and
then
be
forced
to
raise
his
price
to
remaining
customers
to
make
up
for
that
volume.
you
recall
there
are
many
discussions
in
mr.
justice
burton's
opinion
there
in
which
he
says
we
don't
construe
the
act
as
a
congressional
intent
to
eliminate
this
competition.
now,
i
can
see
congress
--
mr.
william
simon
yes,
because
i
say
that
frustrates
the
congressional
intent
of
congress
--
mr.
william
simon
but
the
robinson-patman
act
represents
mr.
justice
white
a
congressional
policy.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir.
but
in
2
(b)
this
court
--
mr.
william
simon
but,
in
2(b)
this
court
has
held
that
congress
gave
sellers
an
absolute
right
to
reduce
their
price
to
meet
competition.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
don't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
this
court
has
amended
the
robinson-patman
act
in
any
of
its
decisions.
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
stevens
was
that
in
interpreting
the
robinson-patman
act,
this
court
has
consistently
tried
to
reconcile
it
with
the
sherman
act
and
to
give
it
that
construction
which
would
permit
both
to
live
side
by
side.
and
that
national
policy
which
is
reflected
in
the
robinson-patman
act
guarantees
one
the
right
to
reduce
his
price
in
individual
competitive
situations
to
meet
the
lower
price
of
the
competitor
which
this
statute
would
take
away
--
mr.
william
simon
yes.
and
that
is
a
statute
which
represents
congressional
policy
and
which
the
state
of
maryland
we
say
cannot
enact
a
law
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
deprive
us
of
the
rights
given
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
william
simon
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
court
has
viewed
it
as
an
intrusion.
i
know
that
what
mr.
justice
stevens
was
referring
to
was
that
many
commentators
have
said
the
acts
are
inconsistent.
but,
this
court
has
never
gone
that
far,
and
all
that
i
can
say
this
court
has
done
is
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
construe
robinson-patman
consistent
with
the
policy
of
promoting
competition
and
i
say
that
is
federal
policy
which
is
frustrated
by
this
maryland
statute.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
think
the
short
answer
is,
yes,
a
little
longer
answer
is
that
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
we
say
that
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
deprive
us
of
a
competitive
right
which
the
congress
has
granted
under
2(b)
and
which
this
court
in
1951
in
standard
oil
said
was
an
absolute
defense
to
a
charge
of
price
discrimination
no
matter
how
serious
the
harm
and
the
injury
were
that
it
caused.
mr.
william
simon
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
we
have
exactly
the
problem
that
was
in
perez
where
the
bankruptcy
act
said
that
if
you
go
through
--
you're
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
you
don't
owe
anybody
any
money
anymore,
and
the
state
of
arizona
passed
a
law
which
says
if
you
have
a
judgment
against
you
for
negligence
in
operation
of
an
automobile,
you
may
not
get
a
driver's
license
till
you
pay
that
judgment.
and
this
court
held
in
perez
that
the
arizona
law
was
unconstitutional
because
it
conflicted
with
the
federal
bankruptcy
law
that
said
once
you
gone
through
bankruptcy,
you
didn't
owe
the
money.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
rath
packing
case
decided
just
this
last
term
by
this
court
where
california
passed
a
statute
saying
that
packaged
meats
had
to
be
measured
by
their
weight
at
the
place
where
they
were
sold.
and
federal
law
said
packaged
meats
had
to
be
measured
by
their
weight
at
the
place
where
they
were
packed.
and
of
course
depending
on
the
moisture
of
the
climate,
the
meat
will
either
gain
weight
or
lose
weight
after
it
leaves
the
factory
and
the
california
law
was
held
invalid
because
it
conflicted
with
the
federal
law
and
one
could
not
comply
with
the
federal
law
and
the
state
law
at
the
same
time.
mr.
william
simon
but
the
one
thing
--
and
i
believe
--
mr.
william
simon
but
federal
law,
federal
policy
which
is
reflected
not
only
in
the
sherman
act
but
in
the
robinson-patman
act
as
well
is
pro-competition.
it's
more
competition.
and
anything
that
says
that
if
you
reduce
your
price
to
one
customer
in
baltimore,
you've
got
to
reduce
it
to
every
customer
far
west
as
--
mr.
william
simon
it's
anticompetitive
mr.
justice
white,
it
seeks
to
make
the
price
of
reducing
the
cost.
mr.
william
simon
it
seems
to
make
the
cost
so
high
--
mr.
william
simon
that
nobody
will
do
it
and
certainly
if
they
passed
the
law
and
said,
you
couldn't
reduce
your
price,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
simon
no
sir.
mr.
william
simon
as
introduced,
it
did.
mr.
william
simon
and
the
wholesalers
that
have
a
little
more
power
have
a
--
mr.
william
simon
so
long
as
you
do
not
integrate
backward
and
buy
a
little
refinery,
you
are
exempted.
mr.
william
simon
because
--
mr.
william
simon
because
the
record
shows
that
it
is
the
out
of
state
refiners
who
produce
the
competition
in
the
marketplace
in
maryland,
and
that
it
is
that
very
competition
which
the
legislature
sought
to
eliminate
to
protect
the
high
price
major
brand
dealers
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
compete
with
these
lower
price
people.
mr.
william
simon
yes
sir,
but
i
can
only
say
mr.
justice
white
that
this
burden
is
far
greater
than
that
one
in
hunt
or
in
raymond
transport
or
in
cottrell
or
in
the
bruce
case,
the
cantaloupe
case
in
arizona
for
this
far
greater
restraint
on
competition
here
than
in
any
of
those
cases.
mr.
william
simon
but
in
each
of
those
cases
the
restraint
on
commerce
was
much
less
than
that
here.
in
the
rice
case
last
week
as
i
say,
all
it
required
is
that
the
fellow
run
a
smaller
truck.
it
didn't
say
he
couldn't
run
through
there,
just
says
a
guy
use
a
55
foot
truck
--
mr.
william
simon
but,
it's
going
to
cost
the
maryland
motorist
a
lot
more
money,
a
lot
more
money.
mr.
william
simon
i
appreciate
the
extra
time
and
i
realize
i
understand
--
mr.
william
simon
no
sir,
at
least
not
in
the
oil
industry.
mr.
william
simon
i
do
not
know
of
any
challenge.
i
do
know
that
they
were
graduated
tax
on
the
number
of
units
you
have,
and
i
do
not
know
whether
they
remembered
them
well,
but
i
--
mr.
william
simon
thank
you.
