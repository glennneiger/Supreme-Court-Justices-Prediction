mr.
simon,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
because
i
am
slightly
confused,
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
conduct
that
is
protected
by
the
2(b)
defense?
justice
harry

blackmun
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
something
that's
protected
by
a
2
(b)
defense.
i
am
not
sure
that
follows,
but
may
be
i
misconstrue
your
argument.
