justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
simon
would
you
tell
me
how
the
--
you
arguing
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
how
does
it
burden
the
interstate
commerce?
all
the
gas
that
may
want
to
come
in
to
maryland
from
out
of
state
will
still
come?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
does
that
burden
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
say
you
have
company
owned
station
and
you
move
--
and
you
supply
your
own
stations
and
you
have
storage
tanks
at
the
stations
you're
keeping
full
and
are
you
suggesting
i
guess
you're
that
the
sale
by
your
company
owned
station
out
of
that
supply
that's
stored
supply
to
a
--
to
a
motorist
is
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
thought
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
is
--
that
maybe
a
sherman
act
matter
of
effect
but
i'm
talking
about
the
constitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
something
affects
interstate
commerce,
it
doesn't
mean
its
an
unconstitutional
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
--
are
there
any
examples
in,
i
suppose
there
must
be
a
lot
of
them,
where
the
out
of
state
or
the
out
of
state
refiner
or
wholesaler
sells
directly
to
a
consumer
other
than
through
a
company
owned
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
there's
a
big
truck
line
that
uses
gasoline
and
so
you
--
do
you
send
your
supply
you're
tank
wagons
directly
to
them,
from
out
of
state
directly
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
does
this
forbid
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
can
be
a
dealer
if
you
sell
--
why
does
that
exempt
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
you're
selling
at
retail
to
this
truck
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
ask
you
again
how
does
it
burden
interstate
commerce
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
selling
direct
to
the
consumer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
--
but
critical
your
argument
then
is
selling
--
that
selling
gasoline
at
retail
to
motorists
in
maryland
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
only
attack
on
the
sections
you've
been
talking
about
as
the
burden
on
interstate
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
claiming
a
privilege
and
immunity
to
be
able
to
sell
at
retail
if
maryland
people
can
sell
at
retail?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
although
congress
says
you
don't
violate
the
robinson-patman
act
if
you
are
lowering
your
price
to
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor,
you
are
saying
that
a
state
may
not
have
the
contrary
rule,
a
state
may
not
say
that
you
may
not
lower
your
price
to
meet
the
price
of
a
competitor,
are
you
suggesting
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
was
just
saying
–
all
congress
has
said
as
you
don't
violate
the
robinson-patman
act
if
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
--
robinson-patman
doesn't
say
you
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
just
says
you
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
the
robinson-patman
act
doesn't
require
anybody
to
lower
his
price
to
meet
a
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
it
does
is
permit
them
to
do
it
without
violating
robinson-patman
act
and
you
are
saying
maryland
cannot
prevent
meeting
competition
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
is
the
effect
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
costs
you;
it's
really
going
to
cost
you,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
are
not
going
to
lower
the
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
mind
if
i
went
back
to
your
first
argument
just
for
a
moment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
maryland
law
does
not
forbid
just
chains
of
wholesalers
--
from
a
wholesaler
who
owns
a
chain
of
service
stations
to
operate
in
maryland.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
well,
however
it
came
about,
let's
assume
i
have
a
wholesaling
chain
of
service
stations,
the
headquarters
are
in
pennsylvania
and
they
buy
their
gasoline
from
producers
or
refiners
and
have
their
own
delivery
system
from
outside
the
state
into
maryland
and
they
have
a
string
of
stations
in
maryland,
now
that's
not
forbidden
by
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
discrimination
against
producers
and
refiners,
it
isn't
–
it's
not
a
--
why
is
it
a
discrimination
or
a
burden
on
the
state
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
kind
of
commerce
is
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
interstate
--
the
constitution
doesn't
say
that
every
burden
on
competition
is
bad.
it
says
that
it
forbids
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
long
run
the
same
amount
of
gasoline
is
going
to
come
into
maryland,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
do
you
happen
to
recall
if
during
the
--
back
in
1930s
or
1920s
when
a
lot
of
states
were
enacting
legislation
prohibiting
chain
stores
from
coming
in,
were
those
statutes
ever
challenged
on
this
sort
of
ground,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
talking
about
the
retail
grocery
business
actually.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know
you
would.
that's
right.
thank
you.
