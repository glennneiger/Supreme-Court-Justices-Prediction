we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
77-10,
exxon
corporation
against
the
governor
of
maryland
and
the
related
and
consolidated
cases.
mr.
simon
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

and
now
traditionally
though,
have
not
the
price
cutters,
so
they
were
called
by
the
majors,
have
not
--
the
price
cutters,
the
small
independents
who
just
bought
their
gas
catches
catch
can
than
the
people
who
supplied
a
major
share
of
price
competition
in
the
market,
i
am
not
speaking
of
maryland
specifically
but
over
the
country
generally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
the
management,
do
you
mean
the
management
is
running
the
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
not
these
local
retailers
characteristically
the
price
cutters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
i
was
not
on
the
same
wavelength
in
terms
what
they're
called,
i'm
talking
about
the
individual
station
the
independent
who
buys
this
gas
wherever
he
can
get
it
including
as
you
suggest
50%
of
the
major
producers
output
frequently
goes
to
these
independents
and
it
sold
without
a
brand
name.
now
do
those
people
selling
with
no
brand
name
except
one
they
invent
but
may
sell
five
different
kinds
of
gasoline
over
a
period
of
months
under
that
name,
are
they
not
the
price
cutters
in
the
maryland
as
they
are
in
most
other
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
virginia
does
with
liquor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
simon
we've
been
taking
up
a
good
deal
of
your
time,
and
perhaps
we
do
the
same
with
your
friends,
we'll
enlarge
the
time
for
10
minutes
for
you
and
that
will
enable
the
attorney
general
to
give
his
colleague
equal
time
if
he
wishes
to,
you'll
have
an
additional
10.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
going
to
end
your
rebuttal
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
77-10,
exxon
corporation
against
maryland
and
the
consolidated
related
cases
will
be
announced
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
