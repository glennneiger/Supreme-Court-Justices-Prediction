mr.
simon
there
had
been
declining
number
of
retail
outlets
in
maryland,
haven't
there,
at
the
time
this
law
was
passed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
makes
it
essential,
essential
from
whose
point
of
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
so
essential
that
it
can
override
maryland
policy
on
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
advocated
before
the
maryland
legislature
and
they
have
turned
you
down
and
the
question
now
i
suppose
is
whether
you
have
a
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
the
state
not
entitled
to
prefer
independently
operated
stations
to
the
kind
of
perfect
model
of
competition
without
violating
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
maryland
isn't
preferring
maryland
oil
over
other
oil
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
shell
appealing
here?
shell
strikes
me
as
a
prototype
of
the
kind
of
person
you
say
would
be
protected
by
this
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
state
of
maryland
would
be
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause
from
making
a
–
the
selling
of
gasoline
a
state
monopoly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
couldn't
do
what
virginia
has
done
with
liquor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
commerce
clause
isn't
though
basically
protect
consumers,
it's
to
prevent
barriers
erected
by
one
state
to
people
who
want
to
do
business
and
then
on
the
same
terms
as
people
who
are
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
all
you
have
to
do
is
sell
your
gas
to
an
independent
retailer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
–-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
minute
ago
you
said
how
robinson-patman
has
been
so
tempered
by
the
sherman
act
and
now
you
say
it's
a
fundamental
congressional
policy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
simply
says
he
doesn't
violate
the
robinson-patman
act
if
he
does
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
say
then
the
robinson-patman
which
the
court
has
viewed
is
kind
of
an
intrusion
on
the
sherman
act
nonetheless
preempts
the
field
when
it
comes
to
the
state
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
didn't
turn
competition,
they
turned
down
commerce,
didn't
they,
the
movement
of
goods?
