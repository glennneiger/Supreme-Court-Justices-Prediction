mr.
simon,
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
compliance
with
the
maryland
statute
that
would
violate
the
robinson-patman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
to
have
a
uniform
price
throughout
the
state,
you
don't
have
a
price
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whatever
caused
it,
as
long
as
your
price
is
uniform
throughout
the
state,
you
don't
have
price
differential
to
even
trigger
2(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
differential
between
the
state
of
maryland
and
nearby
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
always
have
where
you
have
different
taxes
and
that
sort
of
thing,
isn't
there
typically
a
price
differential
when
you
cross
state
lines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
remote
possibility,
isn't
it,
six
to
seven
cent
differential
between
a
uniform
price
throughout
the
state
of
maryland
and
price
across
the
state
of
maryland?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
state
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
say
that
in
maryland
you
got
to
charge
uniform
prices
and
if
you
do
charge
uniform
prices,
you
don't
violate
the
robinson-patman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
contrary
to
the
2(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
but
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
very
similar.
it's
also
anticompetitive
statute.
i
don't
like
it
at
all,
but
i
don't
see
the
inconsistency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
maryland
said
that
gasoline
will
be
sold
at
$0.75
a
gallon
in
our
state,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unlike
other
cases
to
be
announced
today,
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
this
case
arises
from
the
highest
court
of
state
of
maryland
and
is
an
appeal
in
which
several
oil
companies
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
maryland
statute
enacted
in
1973
involving
the
retail
distribution
of
gasoline
within
that
state.
the
statute
has
two
features
which
were
challenged
in
the
litigation.
first,
it
prohibits
companies
which
own
oil
refineries
or
producing
facilities
from
operating
retail
stations
and
secondly
it
provides
that
if
an
oil
company
grants
a
voluntary
allowance
which
is
a
form
of
price
reduction
to
any
station
which
it
serves
it
must
grant
the
same
price
reduction
to
all
stations
which
it
serves
throughout
the
state.
the
devastator
provision
of
the
statute
was
challenged
on
the
ground
that
violates
substantive
due
process
and
also
violates
the
interstate
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
voluntary
allowance
part
of
the
statute
was
challenged
on
the
ground
that
it
conflicts
with
the
portion
of
the
robinson-patman
act
which
allows
a
seller
to
meet
competition
in
good
faith
without
violating
the
federal
statute.
we
reject
the
constitutional
attacks
on
this
statute
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
which
upheld
the
statute.
mr.
justice
powell
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion,
disagreeing
with
the
court
on
the
commerce
clause
analysis.
our
constitutional
holding
of
course
does
not
endorse
in
any
way
of
wisdom
of
this
particular
legislation.
