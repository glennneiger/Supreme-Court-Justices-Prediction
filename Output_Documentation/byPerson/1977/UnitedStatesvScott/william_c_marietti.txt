mr.
william
c.
marietti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
confine
my
discussion
with
the
court
this
morning
to
rebutting
the
brief
submitted
by
the
government
in
this
case
and
as
far
as
our
positive
position
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
rely
on
my
brief
in
this
matter
and
i
do
not
intend
to
reiterate
that.
i
think
it
is
neat
for
the
court
in
launching
a
discussion
in
the
consideration
of
this
case
to
first
consider
what
we
do
know
about
this
case.
there
is
a
parent
agreement
between
both
the
government
and
the
respondent.
now,
it
is
clear
that
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
the
serfass
decision
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
trilogy
which
this
court
recently
has
decided
that
wilson-jenkins-serfass
trilogy,
as
the
court
has
referred
to
them
in
the
lee
decision.
it
is
clear
we
do
not
have
serfass
here
because
we
have
jeopardy
attaching
and
i
read
the
serfass
decision
as
making
that
determination
the
critical
factor
and
the
reason
for
the
decision
in
serfass
to
permit
a
retrial
of
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
the
defendant,
mr.
scott,
was
put
to
trial
both
with
regard
to
the
government’s
proofs
and
to
the
defendant’s
proofs
and
as
to
count
three,
which
of
course
is
not
before
the
court,
it
was
sent
to
the
jury.
so
the
jeopardy
has
attached
under
the
downum
decision
once
that
jury
was
empaneled,
once
they
began
to
consider
the
evidence.
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
we
do
not
have
the
situation
that
we
had
in
lee
or
the
situation
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
the
sisson
decision
where
counsel
merely
sat
back
and
waited
until
he
knew
jeopardy
had
attached
and
then
attempted
to
use
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
a
sword,
not
as
a
shield,
but
as
a
sword,
deliberately
deferred
his
decision
to
file
a
motion
on
legal
grounds
until
after
jeopardy
had
attached.
i
think
the
court
was
quite
concerned
about
running
into
that
situation
and
certainly
in
the
lee
case,
they
came
very
close
to
that
situation.
counsel
in
that
case
had
deferred
his
motion
until
the
very
morning
of
trial
and
a
motion
that
would
require
research
and
he
very
well
knew
that
and
that
was
noted
by
the
trial
judge
in
his
opinion
because
he
said
“gentlemen,
i
am
going
to
need
time
to
consider
this
motion”
and
they
then
proceeded
with
the
proofs.
now,
that
is
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
it
depends
how
the
court
decides
to
look
at
what
prosecutorial
error
is.
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
prosecutor
made
error
by
delaying
in
bringing
the
indictments
in
this
case
when
he
had
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
certainly
not.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
think
that
is
true
except
for
the
situation
where,
of
course,
the
court
itself
makes
an
error,
but
basically,
of
course,
it
is
based
on
my
opponent
making
error
in
the
case.
but
i
think
the
lee
decision
also
is
different
for
an
important
reason
and
the
important
reason
is
that
that
prosecutorial
error
is
capable
of
being
corrected.
if
in
fact
it
was
error,
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
argued
in
that
case
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
make
error,
it
was
clear
that
the
prosecutor
had
made
error,
he
had
filed
a
defective
information
or
indictment
and
if
that
is
the
situation,
i
submit
that
readily
lends
itself
to
correction.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
say
i
am
not
necessarily
saying
i
agree
with
the
lee
decision.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
but
i
am
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
that
i
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
here
for
that
reason
because
the
lee
decision
did
involve
an
error
by
the
prosecution
that
could
be
corrected,
this
is
not
the
case
here.
in
that
case
it
would
be
simple
for
the
prosecutor
to
simply
file
new
information,
add
the
elements
of
the
offense,
which
i
believe
they
left
out
knowledge
and
go
back
to
trial
and
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
even
indicated
to
the
prosecution
that
if
you
had
done
this
information
properly
and
drafted
it
properly,
there
is
no
question
that
the
facts
here
fit
the
crime.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
with
all
respect,
i
think
we
are
confusing
the
error
that
i
am
talking
about.
he
is
talking
about
the
error
made
by
the
court
in
its
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
motion
made
during
trial
and
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
that
motion
at
trial.
that
is
the
error
he
is
talking
about
and
i
am
talking
about
the
error
that
the
prosecutor
made
in
the
lee
case
which
was
drafting
the
indictment
improperly
and
the
error
that
the
prosecution
made
in
this
case
in
the
delay
in
bringing
the
charges
against
my
client
and
that
delay
can
never
be
corrected.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
feel
it
should
be
critical
because
the
decision
in
lee
and
the
decision
in
dinitz
which
the
government
in
this
case
attempts
to
rely
upon
seems
to
suggest
that
we
somehow
had
a
choice.
we
somehow
determined
our
fate
in
this
case
and
that
we
decided
that
because
of
the
makeup
of
the
jury,
because
of
the
way
the
facts
had
fallen
in
the
case
somehow
we
opted
to
have
this
case
dismissed
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
do
not
think
it
was
that
sort
of
situation
and
here
is
why
i
think
it
is
different.
i
think
it
is
different
because
we
did
not
have
a
tainted
jury
in
this
case
like
you
may
have
had
in
the
dinitz
decision.
we
did
not
have
a
tainted
jury
where
we
were
concerned
with
the
jury
somehow
getting
to
hear
evidence
that
they
should
never
have
heard.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
preferred
to
have
the
judge
decide
my
motion
for
dismissal
prior
to
jeopardy
being
attached.
that
is
what
i
preferred
because
i
filed
a
motion
long
in
advance
of
trial
of
this
case
in
accordance
with
the
court
rules
in
an
effort
to
be
diligent
in
properly
presenting
my
case
to
the
court
and
the
court
denied
that
motion.
they
did
not
just
say
“we
will
take
it
under
advisement.”
the
court
said
“we
deny
that
motion”
and
the
reason
they
denied
that
motion
is
because
he
said
“i
want
to
hear
the
evidence.”
mr.
william
c.
marietti
there
certainly
is.
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that,
but
in
terms
of
what
the
defendant
did
in
this
case,
in
terms
of
choosing
his
own
fate,
i
do
not
think
it
can
properly
be
said
that
we
selected
our
own
fate
in
that
regard
because
we
tried
to
present
this
case
to
the
judge
prior
to
this
jeopardy
even
attaching.
i
have
to
agree
with
the
comments
of
justice
douglas
and
justice
brennan
in
the
lee
opinion
where
they
distinguished
the
situation
where
counsel,
in
good
faith,
goes
to
that
court
and
says
“prior
to
any
trial
or
any
jeopardy
attaching,
may
we
please
have
a
decision
from
this
court?”
if
the
court,
nevertheless,
says
“no,
your
motion
is
denied,”
then
we
have
no
choice.
we
have
to
be
put
in
jeopardy.
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
we
selected
our
fate
in
that
regard,
unlike
the
man
in
dinitz.
the
man
in
dinitz
who
had
already
prejudicial
problems
with
that
jury
in
terms
of
his
lawyer
being
disqualified
and
the
jury
being
confronted
with
this
situation,
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
if
you
brought
in
a
new
jury,
that
it
would
change
our
position
in
front
of
that
jury,
no
matter
how
many
jurors
you
bring
into
this
case,
our
position
and
the
facts
are
still
going
to
be
the
same.
the
pre-indictment
delay
is
still
going
to
be
the
same
no
matter
who
the
jury
is
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
decidedly
different,
i
feel,
from
a
mistrial
situation
where
there
is
prejudice
or
taint
in
that
trier
of
fact
that
occurs
during
the
trial
and
that
is
why
i
feel
this
case
is
completely
different.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
as
to
the
first
motion,
i
would
not.
the
reason
i
would
not
be
taking
the
same
position
is
that
that
question
does
not
require
the
judge
to
hear
the
facts
of
the
case
in
order
to
make
an
appropriate
decision.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
but
the
question
in
that
case
is,
does
the
judge
have
to
know
the
facts
of
the
case?
it
seems
to
me
the
question
in
that
type
of
motion
is
does
the
judge
have
to
know
the
facts
of
the
case
in
order
to
properly
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
constitutional.
i
do
not
feel
the
judge
has
to
have
any
facts
before
him.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
am
not
sure
which
decision
the
court
is
referring
to.
there
are
a
couple
of
decisions
like
that.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
my
position
would
be
different
and
it
is
going
to
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
judge
sua
sponte
at
that
trial
decides
that
now
he
is
going
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
whether
i
renew
the
motion.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
if
i
renew
the
motion
at
that
point,
i
think
i
would
have
to
revert
to
my
position
in
this
case.
i
attempted
in
every
way
within
the
court
rules
and
within
proper
procedure
to
bring
my
motion
before
trial
and
to
have
a
determination
before
i
was
placed
in
jeopardy.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
i
can
see
a
divergence
of
opinion
with
regard
to
the
court
on
that
issue.
i
think
the
court
from
what
i
have
read
in
--
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
in
my
opinion
in
that
situation
i
would
still
say
that
if
i
have
been
put
to
the
test
of
the
triers
of
fact
that
if
a
jury
has
been
paneled
and
jeopardy
has
been
attached
and
it
is
not
a
manifest
necessity
situation
or
mistrial
situation,
which
it
clearly
is
not,
then
i
would
submit
that
jeopardy
would
attach.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
that
is
right,
but
i
emphasize
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
judge
me
on
those
sorts
of
facts
because
i
made
that
motion
prior
to
trial
and
i
made
it
because
that
is
when
it
was
proper
--
mr.
william
c.
marietti
it
certainly
would
under
the
wilson
decision.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
if
there
has
been
a
determination
by
the
jury
that
can
be
reinstated
following
an
appeal,
then
i
would
have
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
wilson.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
for
this
reason
because
i
think
the
judge
did
make
comments
to
that
effect.
judge
fox,
in
making
his
decision
on
this
motion,
indicated
not
only
that
my
client,
mr.
scott,
suffered
from
a
problem
with
recall
of
the
events,
he
also
noted
that
the
chief
witness
for
the
government,
the
informant
mr.
jordan,
also
experienced
difficulties
recalling
the
events
and
the
judge
made
that
part
of
his
decision.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
i
am
sure
i
do
not
have
the
experience
that
the
court
has
in
that
regard,
but
i
certainly
have
been
faced
with
situations
where
the
defendant
does
not
have
a
memory.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
do
not
believe
that
that
part
of
the
case
is
clear
because
the
judge
said
in
his
pretrial
order
“the
motion
is
denied.”
mr.
william
c.
marietti
he
said
“the
motion
is
denied.”
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
he
indicated
the
motion
was
denied
and
he
said
in
that
that
it
was
denied
without
prejudice
and
my
point
in
raising
that
part
of
the
whole
sequence
of
events
is
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
i
am
not
the
counsel
that
you
were
faced
with
in
lee
or
that
you
were
concerned
with
in
the
sisson
decision
that
might
arise
who
waited
till
i
was
in
jeopardy
to
use
it
as
a
sword.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
it
would
be
my
position
on
entrapment.
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
the
law
of
entrapment,
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
it
would
be
my
position
that
since
facts
were
heard
which
goes
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant,
and
he
was
put
to
the
test
as
indicated
in
green
and
in
the
other
decisions,
that
that
certainly
would
bar
appeal
of
that.
that
would
be
my
position
on
that
and
that
raises
another
point.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
that
is
right.
i
feel
that
way,
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
the
real
interest
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
set
forth
in
green,
but
again,
i
emphasize
that
is
not
the
case
here
and
that
is
one
of
the
underpinnings
of
my
whole
presentation
to
this
court,
is
that
i
did
not
sit
back,
i
did
not
sit
back
and
use
this
double
jeopardy
clause
as
a
sword.
i
did
everything
that
responsible
lawyering
requires
in
terms
of
bringing
these
motions
ahead
of
time
so
that
i
would
not
be
placed
in
jeopardy,
i
would
not
have
to
be
placed
in
that
situation
and
by
the
time
we
got
to
trial
and
we
got
all
the
way
through
the
trial,
i
was
forced
to
forgo
asserting
a
legal
right.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
absolutely
not
and
i
think
the
government
and
i
are
in
agreement
on
this
respect.
this
is
a
peculiar
type
of
motion,
a
motion
for
pre-indictment
delay
because
it
does
require
evaluating
the
prejudice
to
the
defendant
versus
the
intentional
activities
of
the
government
and
i
think
it
is
necessary
in
that
situation
to
hear
some
of
the
facts,
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
know
the
judge
took
that
into
account,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
know
that
he
took
into
account
that
this
man
was
involved
in
a
number
of
narcotics
transactions,
a
myriad
of
them
in
the
course
of
his
police
duties
and
that
there
was
a
myriad
of
times
and
days
that
he
was
required
to
testify
to
as
a
police
officer,
let
alone
in
defending
himself.
i
am
quite
sure
the
judge
was
cognizant
of
that
when
he
made
his
ruling
in
this
case.
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
and
i
would
agree
with
--
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
am
not
sure.
i
do
not
see
the
parallel.
i
do
not
see
it.
if
i
might
return,
i
also
have
to
disagree
with
the
position
that
has
been
put
forth
here
by
the
government
this
morning
which
i
think
justice
stevens
commented
on
that
somehow
this
is
not
the
jenkins
situation
because
we
do
not
have
“an
acquittal”
here.
now,
i
think
we
have
come
to
the
point
now
where
we
do
not
get
hung
up
on
the
terms
whether
it
is
label
an
acquittal,
a
dismissal,
or
whatever,
in
my
reading
of
the
opinion
in
jenkins,
the
court
was
unsure.
the
court
was
not
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
final
resolution
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
was
clear
in
the
jenkins
decision
that
there
had
been
a
final
resolution
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
truly
an
acquittal
for
the
failure
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
element
of
knowledge
or
not.
the
court
said
that
there
were
unclear
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
a
situation
similar
to
those
situations
where
you
do
have
an
acquittal,
but
the
court
did
not
come
out
and
say
“jenkins
was
an
acquittal”
and
i
am
not
here
before
this
court
today
arguing
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
an
acquittal.
but
certainly
in
this
case,
as
was
stated
in
the
wilson
decision
by
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent,
certainly
in
that
case
the
court
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
it
did
had
to
consider
all
of
the
facts
in
the
case,
facts
which
bore
the
elements
of
the
offense
as
well
as
on
the
motion
in
that
case
which
was
the
same
as
in
this
case,
for
pre-indictment
delay.
there
is
one
inescapable
conclusion
that
flows
from
the
argument
of
the
government
in
this
case,
one
inescapable
conclusion
that
this
court
felt
was
crucial
in
the
decision
they
rendered
in
jenkins
and
that
simply
is
that
mr.
scott,
if
this
court
should
say
there
is
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
appeal
on
the
sixth
circuit
and
if
that
sixth
circuit
should
say
that
judge
fox
was
in
error,
which
we
do
not
believe
he
was,
but
that
is
not
what
is
before
this
court,
mr.
scott
is
going
to
undergo
yet
another
trial
and
that
is
not
the
situation
we
had
in
wilson
and
it
is
the
situation
we
had
in
jenkins.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
that
is
true.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
i
take
the
position,
justice
marshall,
that
once
the
judge
denied
our
motion,
our
motion
was
over
and
we
were
placed
in
jeopardy
at
that
point.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
we
certainly
did,
where
else
can
we
renew
the
motion
is
the
problem?
mr.
william
c.
marietti
pardon
me?
mr.
william
c.
marietti
it
certainly
was.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
the
motion
that
he
granted
in
all
fairness
to
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
was
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
for
pre-indictment
delay.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
agree
completely
with
that
position.
i
think
the
whole
court,
from
what
i
read
in
the
decisions
agrees
with
that
position
that
we
are
not
going
to,
but
these
manage
hinge
on
terminology.
but
i
do
see
the
situation
here
arising
that
you
had
in
jenkins.
this
man
is
going
to
have
to
face
trial
again.
all
the
way
through
the
trial,
and
we
did
not
have
a
situation
here
where
we
had
a
short
bench
trial
or
we
had
a
trial
that
was
terminated
partway
through
the
prosecution’s
case,
mr.
scott
went
through
the
entire
trial.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
i
understand
that,
but
in
lee,
i
think
in
that
case
the
court
took
note
that
it
was
clear
that
the
judge
did
not
contemplate
that
this
man
could
never
be
convicted
of
these
offense
because
the
judge
said
in
lee,
in
his
decision
he
said
“look,
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
here,
but
the
information
is
drafted
improperly”
and
i
think
the
court
in
dinitz
also
said
the
same
thing
because
they
gave
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
retain
further
counsel
in
the
case
if
he
granted
as
a
mistrial.
that
contemplates
that
there
is
going
to
be
another
trial
and
i
thought
what
the
court
said
in
lee
was
is
that
if
the
decision
rendered
by
the
lower
court
was
to
the
effect
that
this
man
can
never
be
prosecuted
for
this
offense
that
he
simply
cannot
be
convicted
and
in
fact
in
this
case,
if
there
was
pre-indictment
delay,
then
he
never
can
be
convicted
of
that
offense.
i
submit
that
is
what
this
court
said
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
like
the
language
in
lee,
but
different
from
the
facts
in
lee
because
there
is
nothing
that
can
correct
pre-indictment
delay.
there
is
something
that
can
correct
an
improperly
drafted
information,
but
it
can
never
be
corrected
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
the
judge
when
he
ruled,
and
we
knew
that
when
he
ruled,
was
making
a
ruling
based
on
an
assumption
that
this
man
could
never
be
convicted
of
this
offense
and
that
is
exactly
what
lee
seems
to
distinguish.
it
says
“if
that
is
the
situation
we
have,
then
clearly
we
have
a
situation
where
the
double
jeopardy
clause
will
act
as
a
shield,”
not
a
sword
but
as
a
shield.
i
see
my
time
is
approaching
an
end
and
i
would
just
like
to
comment
finally
on
the
alternative
that
the
government
proposes
in
this
case
and
that
alternative
seems
to
be
that
what
we
trial
lawyers
should
do
is
more
or
less
sandbag
the
government
and
wait
until
the
case
is
over
with
and
then
pop
all
your
motions
and
bring
them
out
of
the
bag
and
have
the
judge
decide
them
at
that
point
in
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
marietti
well,
i
would
think
that
the
government
should
have
some
prior
notice
of
the
defendant
having
to
present
this
motion
or
is
going
to
present
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
because
they
certainly
want
to
bring
these
factors
out
in
the
testimony
of
their
witnesses.
i
urge
the
court
not
to
fashion
a
new
rule
of
procedure
for
proceeding
in
these
cases.
the
government
indicated
we
can
call
it
an
arrest
of
judgment.
i
felt
that
in
justice
harlan’s
decision
in
sisson,
that
he
clearly
indicated
that
if
you
are
going
to
get
involved
in
deciding
something
that
requires
a
decision
on
the
facts
that
goes
beyond
the
face
of
the
indictment,
that
that
is
clearly
not
an
arrest
of
judgment.
so
i
cannot
buy
the
government’s
argument
in
this
case
that
we
could
make
a
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment
because
that
decision
of
the
judge
would
make
that
the
conclusion
of
that
case
would
necessarily
be
based
upon
the
facts.
i
submit
to
the
court
in
conclusion
that
if
this
court
fashions
this
new
form
of
procedure
for
proceeding
in
trial
courts
on
pretrial
motions
and
motions
at
trial,
you
are
going
to
create
chaos.
you
are
going
to
have
judges
that
were
put
in
the
position
that
the
judge
was
in
the
lee
case
for
somebody
running
in
on
the
day
of
trial
and
saying
“here
is
my
motion,
decided
it
now.”
the
judge
cannot
possibly
do
it
and
the
judge
should
not
be
put
in
that
position.
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
saying,
“gentlemen,
we
have
not
come
here
to
use
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
a
sword.
i
think
that
was
intended
as
a
shield
by
the
constitution
and
we
have
done
everything
we
can
to
be
certain
that
it
would
be
used
in
that
fashion.”
thank
you.
