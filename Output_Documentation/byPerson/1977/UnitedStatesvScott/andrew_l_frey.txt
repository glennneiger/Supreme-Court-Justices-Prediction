mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
dismissing
the
government’s
appeal
in
this
case
which
was
taken
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
dismissed
count
one
of
the
indictment
against
respondent
on
grounds
of
prejudicial
pre-indictment
delay.
the
relevant
facts
are
simple
and
may
be
summarized
briefly.
in
march
1975,
respondent
was
charged
in
a
three-count
indictment
with
distributing
controlled
substances
on
three
separate
occasions;
cocaine
on
september
20,
1974,
codeine
on
september
24,
1974,
and
heroin
on
january
22,
1975.
he
moved
before
trial
to
dismiss
the
first
two
counts
on
due
process
grounds,
alleging
prejudicial
pre-indictment
delay.
the
motion
was
denied
with
the
proviso
that
it
could
be
renewed
after
presentation
of
evidence
at
trial.
it
was
renewed
and
again
denied
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution’s
case,
at
which
time,
a
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
also
denied,
the
court
indicating
that
the
prosecution
had
put
on
enough
evidence
to
take
the
question
of
respondent’s
guilt
or
innocence
to
the
jury.
the
pre-indictment
delay
motion
was
again
renewed
after
the
defense
had
rested
and
this
time
it
was
granted.
the
united
states
then
sought
an
appeal
and
we
are
concerned
here
solely
with
the
dismissal
of
count
one.
the
court
granted
respondent’s
motion
to
dismiss
that
count
on
the
basis
of
delay,
finding
that
there
had
been
intentional
delay
by
the
government
in
bringing
the
charge
for
the
improper
purpose
of
accumulating
evidence
of
other
crimes
by
the
respondent,
and
that
the
delay
of
five-and-half
months
had
prejudiced
the
respondent
because
it
had
interfered
with
his
ability
to
recollect
the
events
of
the
date
on
which
the
offense
allegedly
occurred.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
dismissal
of
our
appeal
as
to
count
two.
in
light
of
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
united
states
against
lovasco,
the
dismissal
was
indisputably
erroneous.
the
question
this
court
must
decide
is
whether
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
correction
of
the
error
by
an
appeal
and,
of
course,
whether
the
united
states
can
appeal
depends
on
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
a
second
trial
of
respondent
if
the
appeal
were
successful.
now,
let
me
approach
this
question,
first,
by
describing
some
of
the
legal
terrain
that
this
court
has
traversed
in
the
last
several
years
and
by
positioning
the
present
case
on
the
double
jeopardy
landscape.
the
issue
in
the
present
case
is
akin
to
those
recently
decided
by
the
court
in
cases
such
as
wilson,
jenkins,
dinitz,
martin
linen,
lee
and
finch,
and
which
it
has
now
before
in
sanabria.
as
a
result
of
these
decisions,
the
court
has
authoritatively
answered
many
questions.
for
instance,
wilson
made
clear
that
the
government
could
appeal
a
dismissal
or
an
acquittal
that
followed
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty
when
success
on
appeal
would
not
require
a
second
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
jenkins,
martin
linen
and
finch
established
that
in
most,
if
not
all,
other
circumstances
the
double
jeopardy
clause
confers
upon
defendants
in
criminal
cases
an
interest
in
retaining
the
benefits
of
a
post-jeopardy
acquittal
by
either
judge
or
jury
whether
or
not
the
acquittal
is
legally
or
factually
correct.
this
interest
precludes
a
government
appeal
to
review
the
propriety
of
such
acquittals.
dinitz
and
lee,
on
the
other
hand,
established
that
a
mid-trial
termination
not
amounting
to
an
acquittal
on
the
merits
if
requested
by
the
defendant
does
not
bar
a
second
trial,
at
least
as
long
as
the
termination
is
of
a
kind
that
allows
or
contemplates
the
possibility
of
further
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
am
not,
but
they
have
at
least
established
a
group
of
cubbyholes
in
which
certain
situations
can
be
placed.
we
know
what
the
rules
are
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
reexamine
any
of
the
cases.
i
think
there
is
some
inconsistency
in
rationales,
but
nevertheless,
some
clear
strains
of
decision
or
lines
of
policy
that
i
will
attempt
to
elucidate
that
shed
considerable
light
on
the
proper
outcome
of
this
case.
this
case
falls
in,
and
as
yet
unexplored,
middle
ground.
on
the
one
hand,
it
plainly
does
not
involve
an
acquittal
under
any
acceptable
definition
of
the
term.
unlike
jenkins,
unlike
martin
linen,
unlike
finch,
there
was
here
no
determination
that
respondent
did
not
commit
the
offense
that
he
was
charged
with
nor
was
there
a
resolution
in
respondent’s
favor
of
any
facts
relating
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
there
may
be
cases
such
as
sanabria
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
there
has
been
an
acquittal,
but
this
is
not
such
a
case.
instead,
there
was
here
simply
a
determination
that
regardless
of
respondent’s
guilt
or
innocence,
wholly
independent
factors
preclude
his
conviction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
a
dismissal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
motion
which
was
made
prior
to
trial
and
which
was
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
which
would
be
the
proper
remedy
if
the
legal
grounds
were
correct.
thus,
the
case
is
holding
that
an
acquittal
may
not
be
reviewed
on
appeal
where
a
second
trial
would
result
from
a
reversal
are
not
controlling
here.
on
the
other
hand,
this
case
is
not
necessarily
controlled
by
the
mistrial
dismissal
cases
such
as
dinitz
and
lee.
those
cases
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
on
the
ground
that
their
determination
of
the
first
trial
did
not
result
from
a
ruling
that,
if
correct,
would
bar
further
prosecution
of
the
charge.
unlike
what
the
court
was
able
to
say
in
lee,
the
court
could
not
say
here
that
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
mistrial.
nevertheless,
we
submit
that
the
instant
case
is
markedly
closer
in
almost
all
material
respects
for
the
mistrial
dismissal
line
of
cases
than
to
the
acquittal
line
of
cases.
accordingly,
the
government’s
appeal
in
the
ensuing
retrial
if
the
appeal
succeeds
are
not
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
consideration
of
the
relevant
double
jeopardy
policies.
in
an
attempt
to
demonstrate
why
those
policies
are
served
rather
than
offended
by
allowing
the
government’s
appeal
in
this
case.
the
history
of
the
court’s
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
reflects
a
continuing
effort
to
strike
an
appropriate
balance
between
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand,
the
interest
of
society
in
conducting
fair
trials
ending
in
just
judgments
which
subsumes
the
societal
interest
of
the
guilty
should
be
punished
for
their
crimes.
on
the
other
hand,
the
interest
of
the
individual
to
be
sheltered
from
the
anxiety
and
expense
of
multiple
trials,
to
avoid
multiple
punishments
for
a
single
offense
and
to
preserve
a
determination
at
trial
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
offense
charged.
none
of
these
interests
is
absolute.
thus,
society’s
interest
in
legally
just
and
factually
accurate
trial
outcomes
is
required
to
yield
to
the
double
jeopardy
interest
of
an
acquitted
defendant
even
though
the
acquittal
may,
for
instance,
be
the
product
of
a
palpably
erroneous
jury
instruction.
on
the
other
hand,
whatever
interest
the
defendant
has
in
preserving
an
acquittal
must
yield
in
situations
like
wilson
or
like
serfass
where
he
is
not
yet
been
placed
in
jeopardy
when
the
acquittal
occurs.
as
for
the
central
double
jeopardy
interest
of
the
defendant
in
avoiding
multiple
trials,
it
is
well
settled
that
that
interest
too
must
give
way
in
at
least
three
types
of
circumstances.
the
first
is
where
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
and
the
conviction
is
reversed
or
set
aside
subsequently.
the
second
is
where,
as
a
result
of
prosecutorial
or
judicial
error,
the
defendant
elects
to
move
for
a
mistrial
that
terminates
the
first
trial.
the
third
is
where
the
trial
is
terminated
even
over
the
defendant’s
objection
because
circumstances
make
such
determination
manifestly
necessary.
in
all
of
the
cases
involving
the
permissibility
of
a
second
trial
or
of
a
government
appeal,
the
interest
of
the
defendant
that
could
allow
him
to
prevail
has
fit
within
two
categories.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
of
course.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
is
a
balancing
process
and
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
suggest
is
that
the
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
trials
is
not
absolute.
it
requires
a
balance
of
the
societal
interest
in
public
justice
against
the
individual
interest
in
avoiding
repetitious
litigation.
the
manifest
necessity
determination
is
an
effort
to
strike
that
balance
in
a
situation
where
the
trial
has
had
to
terminate
because
of
a
hung
jury
or
acts
of
wars
and
weighed
against
other
circumstances.
it
is
justifiable
to
override
the
defendant’s
right
in
avoiding
multiple
trials.
i
gather
you
have
decided
a
case
this
morning
that
involves
that
very
question.
in
any
event,
if
i
could
come
back
to
the
concept
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
interests
of
the
defendant
which
i
think
can
be
shown
that
neither
of
which
is
implicated
in
this
case.
the
first
interest
which
was
deemed
controlling
in
ball
and
kepner,
jenkins,
martin
linen,
finch
is
the
interest
in
preserving
an
acquittal
if
the
defendant
is
able
to
obtain
one.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
that
interest
is
not
at
all
involved
in
this
case
since
respondent
most
definitely
was
not
exonerated
of
the
charge
of
cocaine
distribution.
the
second
interest,
which
is
central
to
the
mistrial
dismissal
line
of
cases
and
which
prevailed
in
such
cases
as
downum
and
jorn,
is
the
valued
right
of
the
defendant
to
obtain
a
verdict
at
the
first
trial
if
he
wants
one.
cases
implicating
this
interest
both
to
such
factors
as
whether
the
defendant
has
agreed
to
determination
of
the
first
trial
and
if
he
has
resisted
it
to
whether
determination
was
nevertheless
necessary
to
serve
the
ends
of
public
justice.
if,
as
in
dinitz
and
lee,
he
has
sought
the
pre-verdict
determination,
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
that
a
second
trial
should
be
barred
on
the
grounds
of
an
unjustified
deprivation
of
the
defendant’s
right
to
obtain
a
verdict
at
the
first
trial.
now,
respondent
scott,
like
dinitz
and
lee,
did
not
have
his
right
to
settle
his
dispute
with
society
once
and
for
all
at
the
first
trial
taken
away
from
him.
he
could
have
had
a
verdict,
but
he
preferred
instead
determination
on
a
ground
unrelated
to
his
guilt
or
innocence.
so
if
the
appeal
does
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
sure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
under
principles
of
res
adjudicata
that
may
be
constitutionalized?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
agree
that
it
is
an
important
part
of
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects,
but
it
simply
is
inapplicable
way
you
have
an
appeal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is
whether
he
has
an
interest
that
this
court
has
recognized
or
is
now
prepared
to
recognize
should
override
the
societal
interest
in
correcting
error
and
in
obtaining
a
determination
of
his
guilt
or
innocence.
after
all,
the
principal
purpose
of
the
trial
itself
on
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
focuses
is
to
secure
a
determination,
accurate
if
possible,
of
the
defendant’s
guilt
or
innocence.
when
there
has
been
a
determination
that
he
is
not
guilty,
this
court
has
taken
the
view
last
term
in
martin
linen
and
in
finch
that
that
determination
vests
in
the
defendant
an
indefeasible
interest
that
the
government
cannot
attack.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
res
adjudicata,
it
seems
to
me,
because
we
cannot
appeal.
we
cannot
seek
review
of
errors
that
may
have
underlined
the
acquittal,
but
i
think
that
the
reason
that
has
a
special
status
is
because
it
is
a
determination
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty.
i
think
the
court
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
kind
of
determination
is
something
that
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
see
attacked
in
means
that
would
require
a
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
question
that
he
has
an
interest,
but
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
clear
from
the
wilson
case
that
the
interest
in
preserving
the
favorable
judgment
is
not
itself
constitutionally
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
in
wilson
the
defendant
got
the
very
same
kind
of
ruling
that
this
defendant
got
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
a
verdict
of
guilty,
but
he
had
the
same
interest
in
preserving
it
from
attack
on
appeal,
yet,
the
court
allowed
the
appeal
because
it
was
the
concern
with
multiple
trials
and
not
the
right
to
preserve
a
favorable
ruling
and
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
wilson
which
indicates
that
there
--
that
preserving
a
favorable
ruling
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
intend
to
discuss
the
reasons
why
his
interest
in
not
being
tried
twice
is
no
different
from
lee’s
interest
in
not
being
tried
twice.
there
are
two
separate
interests
that
you
have
mentioned.
one
is
the
interest
in
preserving
a
favorable
decision.
as
to
that
interest
i
maintain
and
i
think
the
court’s
decision,
particularly
wilson
support
me,
that
that
interest
applies
to
acquittals
in
a
different
way
from
the
way
it
applies
to
other
kinds
of
favorable
rulings.
as
to
the
interest
in
avoiding
multiple
trials,
that
is
always
an
interest
of
a
defendant
and
that
is
an
interest
in
the
mistrial
situation,
that
is
an
interest
in
the
lee
dismissal
situation,
that
is
an
interest
in
this
situation.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
is
not
an
interest
of
sufficient
force
to
override
the
public
interest
in
having
one
determination
of
the
defendant’s
guilt
or
innocence.
while
this
case
is
technically
distinguishable
from
lee
on
the
basis
of
the
nature
of
the
order
terminating
the
prosecution,
we
submit
that
it
is
controlled
by
the
same
policies
and
that
they
dictate
the
same
result.
neither
in
lee
nor
in
this
case
did
the
defendant
secure
a
favorable
resolution
on
the
merits,
that
that
might
be
supplanted
by
a
second
trial.
in
both
cases,
the
pre-verdict
termination
was
in
response
to
the
defendant’s
own
motion
and
with
his
consent.
now,
we
recognize
that
there
is
dictum
in
lee
seemingly
pointing
to
a
different
result.
i
refer
to
the
following
statement
which
appears
at
page
30
of
432
us.
“where
a
midtrial
dismissal
is
granted
on
the
ground,
correct
or
not,
that
the
defendant
simply
cannot
be
convicted
of
the
offense
charged,
jenkins
establishes
that
further
prosecution
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.”
this
was
such
a
dismissal,
but
we
believe
that
the
statement
in
lee
which
was
not
necessary
to
the
court’s
decision
there
was
never
intended
to
govern
cases
such
as
the
present
one.
two
reasons
support
this
conclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
jenkins
is
not
controlling
here
at
all
because
jenkins
was
an
acquittal.
that
is,
jenkins
was
a
determination
that
mr.
jenkins
had
not
committed
an
offense
under
the
selective
service
laws
because
ehlert
was
not
retroactive.
the
first
reason
why
the
lee
dictum
is
not
applicable
here
is
that
it
was
a
completely
accurate
statement
of
the
situation
in
lee
where
there
was
no
government
appeal.
so
that
if
the
ruling
in
lee
had
been
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
or
determination
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy,
the
second
trial
in
lee
would
have
been
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
here,
we
have
a
government
appeal
which
distinguishes
the
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
issue
in
all
the
cases.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
in
lee
there
was
a
res
adjudicata
issue
that
had
to
be
answered.
that
is,
was
the
decision
of
the
district
court
dismissing
the
indictment
in
lee,
a
final
determination
of
the
controversy
that
would
become
final
by
res
adjudicata
principles
if
there
was
a
failure
to
appeal.
if
that
was
true
in
lee,
then
a
second
trial
would
have
been
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
so
that
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
statement
in
lee
can
be
perfectly
well-understood.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
have
barred
a
retrial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
a
fortiori
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
so
that
the
statement
in
lee
would
be
accurate
if
we
had
proceeded
by
means
of
a
second
trial
rather
than
an
appeal.
now,
apart
from
this
point
and
i
recognize
that
lee
cites
jenkins
and
jenkins
was
a
government
appeal
case,
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
doing
in
lee
was
contrasting
the
dismissal
in
lee
with
the
dismissal
in
jenkins
which
was
in
the
nature
of
an
acquittal,
that
is
a
determination
that
the
defendant
had
not
committed
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged.
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
had
in
mind
this
special
subcategory
of
cases
involved
in
scott
and
i
assume
the
fact
that
certiorari
was
granted,
there
was
some
indication
that
the
matter
was
not
wholly
settled
by
the
statement
in
lee.
moreover,
so
long
as
the
case
does
not
implicate
the
defendant’s
special
interest
in
preserving
a
determination
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
offense
charged,
there
is
no
good
reason
for
distinguishing
among
various
types
of
dismissals
for
purposes
of
determining
the
permissibility
of
a
second
trial.
all
dismissals
that
do
not
determine
guilt
or
innocence
ought
to
be
analyzed
in
the
same
way.
why
should
a
trial
court’s
erroneous
dismissal
on
the
grounds
of
pre-indictment
delay,
statute
of
limitations,
or
discriminatory
prosecution
bar
a
second
trial,
although
a
dismissal
for
some
other
defect
in
the
indictment
or
the
trial
does
not?
we
think
there
is
no
good
reason.
in
either
type
of
case,
the
defendant
is
exposed
as
a
result
of
the
second
trial
to
the
same
amount
of
added
anxiety
and
expense
and
the
prosecution
is
afforded
precisely
the
same
opportunity
to
improve
upon
its
original
presentation.
assuming
as
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
we
are
right
and
if
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
there
is
a
way
that
he
can
escape.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
motion
that
he
made
and
got
the
district
court
to
grant
was
legally
correct,
then
the
dismissal
would
be
affirmed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
right.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
position.
that
of
course
is
what
happened
to
lee.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
true,
but
as
i
tried
to
point
out
earlier
in
my
argument,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
an
absolute
prohibition
against
two
trials
and
indeed
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way.
indeed,
this
case
is
stronger
for
the
government
than
lee
for
the
very
reason
that
you
dissented
from
the
lee
decision
because
in
lee
the
second
trial
was
needed
at
least
in
part
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
prosecutor
in
framing
the
charge,
whereas
here,
the
prosecutor
did
nothing
wrong.
he
brought
a
perfectly
adequate
charge
and
it
was
the
respondent
by
inducing
the
court
to
commit
legal
error
who
prevented
a
verdict
at
the
first
trial.
now,
louis
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
could
have
and
had
he
done
it,
we
would
have
had
it
different
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
believe
that
he
did
grant
the
defendant’s
motion.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
case
that
can
be
treated
like
jorn
as
one
in
which
the
judge
suddenly
popped
up
and
stopped
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think,
technically
it
was
denied,
but
it
was
denied
with
the
understanding
that
it
would
be
considered
at
a
subsequent
point
in
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
so
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
think
so.
in
this
case,
the
judge
said
“i
hereby
grant
the
motion
to
dismiss
with
respect
to
count
one,”
that
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
make
a
difference
if
as
in
united
states
against
jorn,
the
judge
suddenly
popped
up
and
said
i
am
declaring
a
mistrial
before
the
defendant
could
say
anything,
the
jurors
were
discharged.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
he
said
“i
acquit,”
then
you
will
have
a
different
problem,
but
he
most
positively
did
not
say
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
said
he
acquitted?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
serfass
makes
it
clear
that
the
label
has
no
talismanic
effect,
but
if
what
he
did
was
an
acquittal,
that
is
if
what
he
did
was
a
judgment,
however
wrong,
that
the
defendant
had
not
committed
the
defense
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
we
would
not
foreclose
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
what
he
did
was
correct,
we
do
not
in
a
sense
we
do
not
know
whether
what
he
did
was
correct.
we
believe
it
was
incorrect.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
in
light
of
lovasco
i
think.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that
the
ingredients
of
the
formula
were
recited,
but
the
delay
was
the
kind
of
delay,
which
was
for
five-and-half
months,
which
normally
does
not
even
trigger
an
inquiry
and
the
deliberate
nature
of
the
delay
was
the
very
kind
of
thing
which
normally
the
prosecutor,
which
is
normally
recognized
as
the
core
kind
of
appropriate
delay
that
protect
the
identity
of
an
informant
to
further
investigate
to
find
out
the
identity
of
any
potential
confederates
the
source
of
supply
of
narcotics
and
so
on.
i
do
not
want
to
argue
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
now,
if
this
court
upholds
the
dismissal
of
the
government’s
appeal
in
this
case,
the
result
would
be
to
sacrifice
the
societal
interest
in
a
full
and
fair
trial
reaching
a
just
judgment
without
achieving
any
corresponding
benefit
to
the
legitimate
interest
of
criminal
defendants.
no
one
is
asking
here
that
respondent
choose
between
his
right
to
have
an
adjudication
of
his
due
process
claim
and
his
right
to
have
the
merits
of
the
charges
against
him
determined
at
a
single
trial.
both
goals
could
have
readily
been
achieved
by
the
simple
expedient
of
deferring
the
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
until
after
the
verdict.
if
that
is
done
and
the
jury
acquits,
the
matter
is
finished.
if
that
is
done
and
the
jury
convicts,
the
trial
judge
can,
then,
grant
or
deny
the
motion,
the
correctness
of
that
ruling
can
be
reviewed
on
appeal
by
either
side
and
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
appeal,
no
second
trial
will
be
necessary
on
account
of
this
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
jenkins
involved
what
was
really
an
acquittal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
jenkins
was
a
case
in
which
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
was
a
point
which
i
am
afraid
is
now
mooted
by
the
finch
decision
which
is
whether
if
the
judge
had
found
every
fact
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
and
had
then
applied
a
legally
erroneous
theory
to
produce
an
acquittal,
that
acquittal
would
or
dismissal
as
the
judge
labeled
it
in
that
case,
would
be
reviewable
on
appeal.
now,
what
the
court
said
was
that
it
could
not
tell
from
the
record
exactly
what
the
judge
was
doing,
but
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that
was
because
whatever
he
was
doing,
it
was
a
determination
of
the
defendant’s
culpability
liability
for
the
offense
charged,
that
is
did
he
or
did
he
not
commit
an
offense
was
something
that
the
judge
determined
and
there
were
some
questions
as
to
exactly
how
he
determined
that
exactly
what
facts
he
had
found,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
anything
like
this
case
where
the
decision
to
dismiss
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
defendant
committed
a
crime.
it
had
merely
to
do
with
whether
he
was
prejudice
in
his
ability
to
defend
and
so
on,
but
not
he
could
be
guilty
or
he
could
be
innocent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
not
true
in
jenkins.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
hate
to
get
into
that.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
take
that
to
be
the
teaching
of
martin
linen,
yes.
i
just
like
to
sum
up
the
way
i
see
the
equities
of
the
present
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
public
has
a
right
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
to
expose
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
at
least
one
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
that
defendant
should
not
be
permitted
to
defeat
that
important
interest
by
injecting
error
into
a
trial,
halting
it
short
of
verdict,
then
complaining
that
exposure
to
another
trial
would
be
unjust
and
excessively
costly
for
their
selves.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
a
couple
of
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
misconstrues
our
argument
on
the
timing
of
the
motion.
of
course
the
motion
should
be
made
in
the
first
in
instance
in
advance
of
trial,
but
as
we
argued
in
lovasco,
this
kind
of
motion
is
best
determined
only
after
trial.
our
objection
as
to
its
determination
in
the
middle
of
trial
when
our
appeal
rights
are
defeated
contrary,
by
the
way
to
the
policies
of
rule
12
(e)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
in
other
words,
the
motion
should
be
made
before
trial.
now,
respondent
wants
you,
of
course,
to
look
at
this
case
from
the
perspective
of
where
we
stand
now.
he
is
going
to
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
second
trial,
but
if
you
decide
this
case
in
the
government’s
favor,
look
at
it
from
the
proper
perspective
which
is
at
the
time,
at
the
point
in
trial
when
the
respondent
could
have
a
ruling
on
his
motion
and
the
judge
says
“i
am
ready
to
rule
on
your
motion
now.”
now,
respondent
has
a
choice
in
that
situation.
he
can
accept
the
ruling
then
and
there
terminating
the
trial
if
it
is
in
his
favor.
he
simply
does
so
at
the
risk
that
if
he
has
introduced
error
into
the
trial,
the
government
can
get
it
corrected
and
there
will
be
a
second
trial.
alternatively,
he
can
say
without
any
prejudice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
a
very
important
point.
he
says
there
was
prosecutorial
error
in
the
delay.
if
he
is
right,
there
will
be
no
second
trial
because
the
court
of
appeals
will
affirm
the
dismissal.
it
is
only
if
there
was
no
prosecutorial
error
and
no
impermissible
delay,
and
therefore,
no
error
that
needs
to
be
cured
except
one
that
he
has
suggested.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
that
and
that
is
exactly
my
point.
if
there
is,
in
fact,
an
improper
prosecutorial
delay
in
this
case
there
will
be
no
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
the
respondent
was
entitled
to
have
that
issue
decided
in
connection
with
his
trial,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
the
decision
should
have
been
after
verdict
if
he
wanted
to
avoid
the
risk
of
two
trials.
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
if
this
court
reverses
in
scott,
it
will
be
clear
to
defense
counsel
that
he
has
his
choice.
he
can
have
a
midtrial
ruling
if
the
judge
is
willing
to
give
him
one,
pre-verdict
ruling
and
not
ever
get
the
jury’s
determination
of
guilty
or
innocence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
not
“do
not
grant
it.”
he
will
get
it
granted
anyway.
it
is
a
question
of
when
it
is
granted.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
it
is
granted
before
verdict
or
after
verdict.
he
should
say
“your
honor,
i
want
to
see
if
the
jury
will
acquit
me.”
now,
you
may
think
that
that
is
unrealistic
to
expect
from
an
attorney.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
defense
counsel
appreciates
the
possible
cost
in
terms
of
a
second
trial,
remember
rule
12
(e)
says
that
these
kinds
of
motions
are
not
to
be
deferred
for
disposition
during
trial,
if
that
would
compromise
the
appeal
rights
of
the
government
which
if
we
lose
here,
it
certainly
would.
so
this
kind
of
motion
should
not
be.
in
fact,
there
is
some
question
where
the
judge
has
power
to
rule
upon
it
during
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
has
great
deal
of
significance
under
serfass.
that
is,
you
could
have
an
acquittal
that
occurs
prior
to
trial
which
is
really
what
you
will
have
in
serfass.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
makes
a
difference
for
two
kinds
of
situations.
the
first
situation
is
if
you
have
an
acquittal,
that
is
reviewable
if
it
is
prior
to
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
that
is
what
serfass
held.
so
the
time
of
attachment
of
jeopardy
may
be
significant
in
relation
to
the
time
the
judge
makes
the
ruling
that
i
have
looked
at
the
files
and
it
is
plain
to
me
that
the
defendant
has
committed
no
offense.
the
second
respect
in
which
it
is
significant
is
if
you
have
a
manifest
necessity
case
like
the
issue
in
crest
against
klein
(ph)
that
never
got
abandoned
by
the
state.
you
may
have
had
an
unjustifiable
mistrial
declared
by
the
court
and
if
that
was
done
before
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
barred
or
a
retrial
there.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
defense
was
entrapment,
if
the
defense
was
what
justice
white
suggested
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
you
get
into
very
difficult
questions
as
to
whether
what
you
have
is
really
an
acquittal.
if
what
you
have
is
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty
of
a
crime
which
is
insulated
from
review
because
of
the
special
vested
interest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
makes
a
difference
because
if
the
ruling
is
prior
to
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
then
there
is
no
even
inquiry
into
double
jeopardy.
if
the
ruling
is
after
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
in
an
entrapment
case,
it
is
arguable
whether
or
not
that
is
the
kind
of
acquittal
or
dismissal
going
to
the
merits
which
ought
to
be
vested
with
the
kind
of
protection
that
the
court
has
given
in
finch
and
given
in
martin
linen
to
those
kinds
of
rulings,
and
given
in
jenkins.
if
what
you
have
is
as
here
a
claim
that
the
defendant
may
be
guilty,
but
there
was
discriminatory
prosecution,
the
defendant
may
be
guilty,
but
there
was
a
violation
to
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
the
defendant
may
be
guilty,
but
there
was
prejudicial
pre-indictment
delay,
then
you
have
a
class
of
claims
which
as
i
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
are
not
materially
distinguishable
in
policy
terms
from
the
prosecutor
to
draw
up
a
proper
indictment,
the
prosecutor
introduced
prejudicial
and
inadmissible
material
before
the
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
take
that
position.
i
take
it
that
my
opponent
is
harking
back
to
the
sisson
test
which
was
a
statutory
test
which
this
court
in
wilson
essentially
abandoned
for
defining
what
an
acquittal
was,
i
do
not
think
an
acquittal
has
to
do
with
when
the
evidence
is
heard,
but
what
it
goes
to
and
what
the
basis
of
the
judge’s
ruling
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that
is
because
what
the
court
could
not
tell
was
something
a
little
different
here.
what
the
court
knew
in
jenkins
was
that
the
district
court
had
said
ehlert
was
not
retroactive
and
the
defendant
could
not
be
committed
of
willfully
refusing
to
submit
to
an
induction
because
of
the
non-retroactivity
of
ehlert.
the
government
appealed
claiming
that
that
was
legally
erroneous
and
that
we
said
every
fact
necessary
to
support
a
conviction
was
found.
now,
this
court
said
in
effect,
well,
let
us
suppose
that
the
district
court
had
not,
let
us
suppose
the
government
was
right
that
if
the
district
court
had
simply
rested
on
ehlert,
we
could
review
that
and
reverse
it.
let
us
suppose
that,
although
subsequently
i
think
it
was
held
that
that
is
not
so.
then
it
said
“we
still
cannot
tell
whether
the
judge
found
all
the
facts
that
were
necessary
to
support
a
conviction.”
we
are
not
sure
whether
he
found
that
there
was
knowing
refusal
to
submit
to
induction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
the
fact
that
in
jenkins
the
court
may
have
said
whether
or
not
this
was
an
acquittal,
the
fact
that
further
proceedings
are
necessary
bars
an
appeal
does
not
answer
the
question
about
lee
because,
in
lee
and
in
the
mistrial
cases,
it
is
also
true
that
you
do
not
have
an
acquittal,
but
you
still
have
to
make
the
inquiry
into
whether
an
appeal
on
the
second
trial
was
justified.
now,
i
am
suggesting
that
we
have
in
this
case,
a
category
of
ruling
which
when
you
look
at
the
policies
and
what
we
are
trying
to
protect
is
more
likely
than
it
is
like
jenkins
and
the
reason
that
is
so
is
because
in
jenkins,
it
is
plain
that
the
district
court
found
the
defendant
had
not
committed
a
crime.
the
district
court
and
the
supreme
court
was
saying,
well,
“suppose
he
found
out
an
illegally
erroneous
basis,
suppose
we
could
agree
with
the
government,”
and
so
on,
but
there
was
a
finding
that
there
was
no
crime.
now,
here
there
was
no
finding
that
there
was
no
crime
and
we
submit
that
that
is
and
should
be
properly
critical
to
the
double
jeopardy
inquiry.
