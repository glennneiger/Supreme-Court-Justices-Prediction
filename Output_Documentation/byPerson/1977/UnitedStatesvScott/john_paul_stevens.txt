mr.
frey,
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
tell
me
why
jenkins
is
not
controlling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
the
very
last
page
of
the
opinion
it
says
we
cannot
tell
whether
there
was
an
acquittal
or
not.
there
is
no
resolution
of
factual
issue
and
assuming
either
way,
there
is
still
no
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
it
did
not
make
any
difference
for
the
purpose
of
the
decision,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
rather
quickly.
if
i
understand
your
theory
correctly,
you
would
also
say
the
government
could
appeal
if
the
dismissal
say
were
on
a
ground
that
there
had
been
prosecutorial
misconduct
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
would
follow
from
your
theory,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
would
say
you
could
not
appeal
if
say
there
had
been
a
dismissal
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case
for
the
judge
thought
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
i
think
you
would
not
be
able
to
appeal
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
if
the
government’s
submission
is
accepted
and
putting
aside
mistrial
situations
which
are
a
little
bit
special,
does
the
time
at
which
the
jeopardy
attaches
have
any
further
significance?
you
know
we
have
a
case
pending
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
will
say
that
then
the
time
of
attaching
jeopardy
will
not
make
any
difference
anymore,
i
do
not
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
all
the
mistrial
situation.
except
for
serfass,
the
only
time
it
makes
any
difference
is
when
the
question
is
whether
there
is
manifest
necessity
for
a
mistrial.
if
there
is
a
defense,
for
example,
the
statute
of
limitations
or
entrapment,
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
or
any
other
defense
it
could
always
be
reviewed.
it
would
not
matter
whether
the
man
was
in
jeopardy
or
not.
it
is
the
analysis.
it
does
not
make
it
wrong
necessarily.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
i
am
saying
is
that
on
all
those
issues
it
does
not
matter
what
the
time
of
placing
the
man
in
jeopardy
make.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
any
more,
i
do
not
think.
i
may
be
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
need
to
know
when
a
fact
occurred
to
decide
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run,
that
would
be
just
like
pre-indictment
delay,
i
suppose,
the
government
could
appeal
it?
