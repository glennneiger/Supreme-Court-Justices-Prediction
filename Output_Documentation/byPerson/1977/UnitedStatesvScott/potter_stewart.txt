justice

stewart
how
is
it
denominated
by
the
district
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
grant
for
motion
to
dismiss
and
he
was
dismissed?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
continued
during
the
trial,
the
indictment
was
dismissed?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
the
fact
of
the
government
appeal
that
makes
it
necessary
to
make
an
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
the
second
trial
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
that
is
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
government
can
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
only
issue
because
that
is
the
test
to
whether
or
not
the
government
can
properly
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
here,
in
this
case,
in
the
present
case,
had
there
been
no
government
appeal
and
the
government
had
simply
tried
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
retry
a
felon,
it
would
have
been
barred
by
res
adjudicata,
if
nothing
else,
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
said
that
very
early
in
your
argument
that
it
was
probably
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
say
that
because
there
was
a
finding
both
that
this
was
deliberate
conduct
in
the
part
of
the
government
and
that
there
was
result
in
prejudice?
justice
potter
stewart
no
because
in
any
event
even
if
it
was
arguably
correctly
decided
and
correctly
dismissed,
your
only
claim
is
you
had
a
right
to
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
the
merits
of
that
do
not
have
really
had
anything
to
do
with
this
issue
now
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
are
saying
now
what
you
were
starting
to
say
when
you
were
interrupted.
alternatively,
a
defendant
makes
a
motion
based
upon
unconstitutional
pretrial
delay
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
you
are
saying
now
that
the
judge
said
“i
grant
your
motion
and
i
am
about
to
dismiss
the
indictment”
and
you
say
“the
defendant
should
not
do
that.”
he
should
say
“no,
your
honor,
do
not
grant
my
motion
m
let
the
trial
go
on,”
that
is
sort
of
an
alternative.
can
you
imagine
any
defense
counsel
in
the
world
who
would
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
is
supposed
to
say
“no,
do
not
grant
my
motion.
i
want
to
go
on
and
my
client
may
be
found
guilty,
but
do
not
grant
my
motion
to
dismiss
even
though
you
want
to,
your
honor.”
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
takes
good
amount
of
self-restraint
on
part
of
the
defense
counsel?[laughter]
