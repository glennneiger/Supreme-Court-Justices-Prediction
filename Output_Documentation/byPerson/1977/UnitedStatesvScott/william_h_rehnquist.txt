justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
all
of
the
authoritative
answers,
as
you
refer
to
them,
that
had
been
given
by
this
court
to
these
questions
are
consistent
with
one
another,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
and
the
trial
judge
reserved
judgment
and
then
he
made
it
at
the
close
the
government’s
case
to
reserve
judgment
and
made
it
at
close
the
defendant’s
case
and
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
other
than
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
any
other
motion
is
going
to
be
based
on
some
sort
of
prosecutorial
error,
as
justice
blackmun
described
it,
is
it
not,
or
prosecutorial
misconduct,
delay,
improper
search
or
seizure,
or
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
corrected
at
the
sacrifice
of
your
client’s
interest
in
having
his
fate
determined
by
first
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
do
not
have
to
agree
with
any
of
them?[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government’s
argument
here
is
that
what
it
conceives
as
the
error
committed
by
the
trial
judge
too
can
be
correct,
if
it
can
just
argue
it
to
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
that
be
critical
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
did,
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
preferred
to
have
the
trial
judge
dismiss
the
indictment
on
pretrial
delay
grounds
than
go
to
the
jury
and
have
its
verdict
and
make
your
motion
on
pretrial
delay
grounds
afterwards,
the
juror
returned
a
verdict
of
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
there
is
some
reason
for
a
trial
judge
doing
that,
is
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
on
the
issue
of
entrapment
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
something
which
could
not
possibly
have
come
up
before
jeopardy
attached
and
the
judge
grants
that
motion,
is
that
appealable
or
not
under
these
statute
making
appealability
dependent
upon
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
is
it
right
or
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
there
was
no
possibility
of
ever
obtaining
a
ruling
on
that
issue
prior
to
jeopardy
attaching?
the
way
you
say
you
try
to
do,
but
were
prevented
from
doing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lee
was
going
to
have
to
face
trial
again
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
will
be
no
sandbagging
in
the
case
of
waiting
on
a
motion
for
pretrial
delay
since
there
will
be
nothing
that
could
be
done
during
the
trial
to
correct
the
government’s
pretrial
delay
as
you
commented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unlike
the
exxon
case
which
my
brother
stevens
just
announced,
this
is
one
of
several
double
jeopardy
cases
which
the
court
has
head
under
consideration
this
term.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
was
charged
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
michigan
with
three
counts
of
distribution
of
narcotics.
but
before
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
respondent
defendants
motion
to
dismiss
two
counts
of
the
indictment
because
a
pre-indictment
delay
was
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
denied
the
government's
appeal,
dismissed
the
government's
appeal,
saying
it
had
no
right
to
appeal
relying
on
our
opinion
in
united
states
against
jenkins,
because
further
proceedings
devoted
to
the
resolution
of
factual
issues
would
have
been
necessary
if
the
government
had
obtained
a
reversal
in
the
sixth
circuit.
because
we
have
now
concluded
that
rule
laid
down
in
jenkins
impede
substantial
justice,
without
advancing
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
we
overrule
that
decision,
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dismissing
the
government's
appeal.
the
chief
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
protect
criminal
defendants
from
government
oppression
through
repeated
attempts
to
convict
them
of
a
single
crime.
thus,
a
final
judgment
of
either
acquittal
or
conviction
will
bar
a
second
prosecution.
however,
a
defendant's
motion
for
mistrial
ordinarily
will
not
bar
a
second
trial
and
we
conclude
that
the
same
principle
must
be
applied
whenever
a
defendant
persuades
the
court
to
terminate
his
trial
before
judgment
on
the
ground
unrelated
to
guilt
or
innocence.
it
is
not
an
active
governmental
oppression
to
permit
a
second
trial
should
defendant's
legal
position
to
be
shown
to
be
wrong
upon
appeal
following
such
a
determination
by
the
trial
court.
because
the
district
court's
decision
withdrawing
this
case
from
the
jury
was
not
an
acquittal,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
be
offended
by
a
second
prosecution
should
the
government
to
be
able
to
persuade
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
conclusion
as
to
pre-trial
delay.
while
we
are
not
unmindful
of
the
importance
of
stare
decisis,
our
judgments
and
constitutional
matters
are
not
subject
to
legislative
correction
and
we
must
be
willing
to
correct
them
when
the
need
is
manifest.
here
our
increasing
experience
with
the
variety
of
governmental
appeals
has
fully
convinced
us
that
the
rule
established
in
jenkins,
which
i
authored
for
the
court
some
four
years
ago,
is
both
unworkable
and
an
unsound
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
principle.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
joined.
