justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
was
just
a
dismissal.
it
did
not
say
motion
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
say
double
jeopardy?
in
this
case,
there
is
no
way
this
man
can
escape
without
two
trials
under
your
theory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
to
get
two
trials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
position
is
that
it
was
not
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
case,
he
gets
two
trials.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
gets
double
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
a
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
judge
not
have
done
this
on
his
own
motion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
i
said
he
did
not
waive
that
motion,
that
is
significant
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
really
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
material
of
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
the
motion
is
continued
or
whether
the
motion
is
subsequent,
it
does
not
make
any
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
also
acquit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
does
not
agree
with
your
argument
in
this
case.
if
he
had
said
it
in
this
case,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
would
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
be
here
if
what
he
did
was
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
a
case
like
this,
and
after
all
the
evidence
is
all
in,
the
judge
says
“i
have
held
this
motion
up,
i
am
now
ready
to
decide
it.
i
am
going
to
grant
the
motion
because
from
the
witnesses
to
this
case
and
their
demeanor
on
the
stand,
it
is
obviously
that
time
has
interfered
with
their
memory.”
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
have
to
give
some
respect
to
the
second
point,
but
some
of
us
have
tried
some
criminal
cases
and
is
it
not
perfectly
common
that
the
defendant
“disremembers,”
is
that
not
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
the
government
says
that
the
fact
that
this
went
in
and
was
carried
over,
it
really
goes
back
to
the
original
motion
and
that
nothing
transpired?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
trouble
i
think
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
unclear,
you
might
not
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
marietti,
on
the
acquittal
point,
you
cannot
get
an
acquittal
in
your
case
as
i
see
it
because
if
your
original
motion
had
been
granted,
he
would
not
have
been
acquitted.
the
indictment
would
have
been
dismissed,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
a
trial,
i
think
you
do
not
have
to
show
an
acquittal,
could
you
not
make
that
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
renewed
your
motion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
with
the
motion
for
dismissal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
motion
he
granted
was
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
someone
takes
a
position
that
they
are
not
going
to
bury
just
on
language
alone,
are
you
not
too
in
agreement
that
they
are
both
the
same,
you
do
not
need
the
word
“acquittal?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
correct
this
delay?
how
can
the
government
correct
the
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
agree
there
is
no
way
to
correct
a
prosecutorial
delay
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
prosecutorial
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
point,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
decide
whether
a
delay
of
four-and-half
months
is,
if
that
is
what
it
was
here,
in
these
circumstances
is
a
delay
warranting
the
dismissal?
