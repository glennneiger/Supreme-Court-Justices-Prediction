justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
interrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
two
interests.
one,
to
preserve
the
interest
in
the
acquittal
and
the
second
is
to
go
to
the
jury
in
the
first
trial.
now,
that
second
point
is
that,
why
is
the
interest
in
preserving
an
acquittal
not
very
similar
to
the
interest
that
the
defendant
might
have
if,
say,
there
were
an
appeal
and
judgment
entered
here,
i
assume
that
collaborate
it.
if
there
has
been
an
appeal
and
we
said
you
could
appeal
on
that
and
it
was
finally
judged
that
trial
was
too
late,
he
could
not
be
retried
then
either,
why
is
that
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
is
the
principle
of
res
adjudicata
part
of
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
put
it
a
little
differently.
you
say
the
first
interest
is
in
preserving
an
acquittal.
why
does
not
the
defendant
have
an
interest
in
preserving
any
favorable
resolution
of
the
trial
after
he
has
been
put
in
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
that
is
right,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
the
defendant
does
have
an
interest
at
least
in
preserving
a
favorable
judgment
even
though
it
is
not
a
non-determination
of
innocence?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
necessary
to
protect
his
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
after
a
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
interest
there
was
in
not
being
tried
twice
and
here
if
you
prevail
he
will
be
tried
twice?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
apparently
jenkins
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
make
before
a
trial
two
motions,
one
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
purports
to
authorize
the
indictment
for
this
crime
and
secondly
that
in
any
event,
the
statute
does
not
reach
the
facts
contained
in
the
indictment
that
the
statute
does
not
cover
this
charge
and
the
judge
reserves
both
motions,
but
during
trial
you
urge
him
to
grant
either
one
of
them
and
he
grants
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
them.
would
you
be
taking
the
same
position
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
does
terminate
the
trial
and
he
does
not
think
that
you
can
ever
be
retried?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
thought
he
did,
that
is
why
he
waited.
he
thought
putting
the
statute
in
some
kind
of
factual
context
would
help
him
make
up
his
mind
on
the
constitutional
issue
so
he
reserved
and
ultimately
ruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
referring
to
any.
i
am
just
wondering
whether
your
position
would
be
that
there
would
be
double
jeopardy
in
either
one
or
both
of
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
renew
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
under
a
state
procedure,
you
can
make
such
motions
during
trial
and
they
never
were
made
before
trial,
but
you
make
them
during
trial,
what
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
were
the
one
who
urge
the
dismissal?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
my
example,
if
the
judge
said
to
you
“well,
i
had
just
been
reading
the
supreme
court
opinions,
i
am
afraid
i
would
be
in
trouble
if
i
granted
these
motions.
now,
i
am
going
to
wait
until
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
verdict.
if
the
jury
finds
you
innocent,
the
show
is
over
anyway,
but
if
it
finds
you
guilty,
then
i
will
rule
on
your
motion.”
then
i
suppose,
the
decision
in
your
favor
post-verdict
would
be
subject
to
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
i
still
do
not
understand
your
position
with
respect
to
jenkins.
you
say
there
was
an
acquittal
there.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
said
there
was,
but
this
court
did
not
and
this
court
did
not
rest
its
view
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
acquittal.
it
said
it
could
not
tell.
now,
i
would
suppose,
in
reading
that
opinion,
i
suppose
even
if
the
court
had
said
there
was
not
an
acquittal
it
would
have
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
he
did,
the
court
said
further
proceedings
were
necessary?
