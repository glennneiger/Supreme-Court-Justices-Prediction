chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
first
this
morning
76-1382,
united
states
against
scott.
mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
the
manifest
necessity
doctrine,
is
that
not
coupled
with
the
interest
of
justice
both
to
the
public
and
the
accused?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
balancing
process,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
frey.
mr.
marietti?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
the
court
could
have
then
as
fully
advised
in
responding
to
your
pretrial
motion
without
any
evidence
before
him
as
he
was
after
he
had
the
evidence
before
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
it
is
possible
that
among
other
things,
in
postponing
a
ruling
on
the
motion
the
judge
took
into
account
the
fact
that
your
client
was
a
police
officer
who
was
presumably
trained
to
remember
the
facts,
and
therefore,
this
delay
might
be
different
with
respect
to
him
than
for
some
other
person,
not
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
does
that
not
bring
you
very
close
to
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
just
postulated
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
scott
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
