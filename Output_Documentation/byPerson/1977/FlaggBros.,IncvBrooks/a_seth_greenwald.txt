mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
co-counsel
has
stated
the
relevant
facts
of
this
case.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
intervened
and
intervened
at
the
district
court
level
by
a
way
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
and
at
this
time,
there
is
only
one
provision
involved,
uniform
commercial
code
section
7-210,
and
of
course
the
new
york
state
legislature
several
years
ago
passed
that
statute,
but
it
is
my
contention
that
that
is
not
enough
to
make
this
a
matter
of
state
action.
i
think
there
is
really
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
precisely.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
those
two
terms
are
basically
interchangeable.
they
have,
i
think
in
the
past
been
used
alternatively
and
perhaps
confusingly.
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
case
to
make
any
distinction
rather
than
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
if
this
was
before
a
fireplace
that
might
be
the
time
and
the
place,
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case
basically
under
color
state
of
law
and
the
state
action
are
basically
interchangeable.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
think
that
we
basically
have
to
go
back.
section
1983
is
derived
from
and
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
this
court
was
so
held.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
that
is
a
fair
statement.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
has
to
be
some,
once
again
getting
back
to
the
magic
words,
there
must
be
some
state
action
that
has
deprived
you
of
your
constitutional
rights.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
basically
of
course.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
and
i
think
that
was
determined
back
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
i
think
over
century
ago.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
do
not
think
that
much.
i
think
the
law
has
been
reaffirmed
only
a
few
years
ago
by
this
court
in
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison.
but
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
not
only
has
new
york
passed
the
uniform
commercial
code,
48
other
state
legislatures
plus
the
district
of
columbia
have
passed
this
section
that
is
under
challenge
here.
so,
of
course
it
is
rather
obvious
we
have
a
statute
with
nationwide
impact
and
this
statute
simply
regulates
and
authorizes
the
exercise
of
a
power
of
non-judicial
sale
by
the
warehouseman
where
his
customer
may
have
disappeared,
done
any
sort
of
thing
and
not
paid
his
bill.
now,
there
maybe
a
dispute
about
the
bill,
but
that
is
something
else,
that
is
not
a
constitutional
dispute
and
as
i
was
saying,
speaking
about
the
ucc,
the
statute
though
dates
much
further
back
in
ucc
which
is
a
product
of
distinguished
group
of
legal
authorities
of
the
late
50s
and
early
1960s,
it
dates
back
in
new
york
back
to
1879
and
it
is
based
on
and
i
would
emphasized
this,
it
is
part
of
a
uniform
statutory
scheme
of
a
warehouseman
having
a
specific
possessory
lien
of
the
stored
goods
in
his
possession
and
the
statute
by
regulating
sale
by
the
warehouseman
is
basically
a
wholesome
statute.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
put
it
this
way.
age
is
not
a
determinant
factor,
but
when
we
speak
up
and
this
court
has
spoken
traditional
function
of
the
state,
it
becomes
of
interest
and
i
simply
say,
of
interest,
how
old
is
a
statute
because
when
the
court
below,
this
court
of
appeals'
decision
said
that
we
had
transferred
by
the
ucc
provision
and
traditional
function
of
the
state
and
i
can
cite
and
they
even
themselves
cite
the
fact
that
dates
back
to
1879
and
perhaps
and
even
longer
in
other
states,
it
hardly
becomes
a
traditional
state
function
for
warehouseman
to
exercise
the
power
of
non-judicial
sale
when
his
lien
which
is
not
into
question
here
is
still
outstanding.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
have
in
my
brief
of
course
pointed
out
that
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
i
would
prefer
to
rely
on
my
brief
as
i
have
many
things
to
say
here
and
i
think
they
would
go
to
the
merits.
as
i
say
and
i
mention
the
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison
case
which
had
to
do
with
utility
cut
offs,
this
court
enumerated,
it
went
to
the
extent
of
enumerating
what
a
traditional
functions
of
the
state
and
quite
interestingly,
not
one
of
them
even
closely
approached
non-judicial
sale
by
warehouseman
or
anyone
else.
it
is
really
a
total
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
call
non-judicial
sale
which
was
only
threatened
in
the
instant
case
and
never
carried
out
or
cannot
be
now,
to
call
that
a
traditional
function
of
a
sheriff
because
a
sheriff
has
a
significant
power
of
sovereignty
that
the
warehouseman
does
not
have.
basically
stated,
a
sheriff
seizes
property
and
this
is
something
that
the
warehouseman
cannot
do,
did
not
do
in
this
case,
and
never
will
do
because
his
lien
is
based
on
voluntary
consensual
possession
and
there
is
another
aspect
when
you
are
speaking
about
state
action.
it
has
been
generally
recognized
that
this
court
and
any
court
is
much
quicker
to
find
a
delegation
of
state
function,
a
traditional
state
function
in
a
case
that
involves
racial
discrimination
because
that
racial
discrimination
is
at
the
heart
of
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
was
passed
and
what
we
all
know
is
that
that
accredited
relations
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
passage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
not
involved
one
iota
and
i
think
it
is
rather
obvious
that
in
new
york,
a
sale
by
a
warehouseman
like
they
are
challenging
here
and
claiming
the
state
action
the
respondents
are
claiming
is
not
a
traditional
state
function.
now,
there
is
some
authority
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
the
respondent
cite
says
it
is
a
traditional
state
function.
that
is
the
blye
case,
but
i
emphasize
and
i
was
in
involved
in
the
blye
case,
i
argued
that
for
the
attorney
general
up
in
albany.
that
case
involved
a
lien
sale,
simply
liens
not
a
lien
sale
involved
in
innkeeperâs
lien
which
is
a
basically
different
type
of
lien
than
a
warehousemanâs
lien.
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
simply
does
not
control
this
court.
even
the
cases
that
respondent
cites,
shows
that
you
make
an
independent
determination
of
case
where
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
issue
and
once
again,
i
would
emphasize
that
the
question
of
state
action
here
is
one
of
great
importance
because
at
the
present
time,
you
have
a
conflict
in
the
circuits.
the
ninth
circuit
in
california
has
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
as
i
said
and
chief
justice
accepted
my
statement
that
i
would
rely
on
my
brief.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but
you
have
not.
okay,
then
i
will
address
my
answer.
yes,
the
point
is
that
mrs.
jones,
the
late
mrs.
jones
at
the
termination
of
the
district
court
case
by
her
own
action
paid
her
bill
and
got
her
goods
back.
it
was
not
case
of
mr.
altman
trying
to
moot
this
case
out.
this
was
a
matter
of
the
plaintiff
taking
action
in
effect
to
resolve
the
question,
a
question
now
states
that
she
did
not
get
all
her
goods
back
and
some
were
in
damaged
condition,
but
that
is
a
state
law
of
question,
it
is
certainly
not
a
constitutional
issue
and
i
might
point
out
also
of
course
that
my
co-counsel
has
different
views
as
to
the
mootness
of
this
case
and
he
has
a
client
who
is
very
anxious
to
get
this
matter
resolved
because
it
has
been
around
for
an
awful
long
time.
but
i
have
pointed
out
to
your
honors
that
having
an
actual
case
of
controversy
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
case
and
i
felt
the
obligation
to
inform
your
honors.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
once
again,
yes,
this
is
the
second
time,
at
least
on
my
own
personal
experience
that
you
have
a
amicus
brief
opposing
the
attorney
general
from
the
consumer
protection
board.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
well,
they
perform
some
state
function.
as
we
say,
it
is
questionable
who
they
represent.
it
is
also
questionable
and
is
not
questionable,
there
is
no
doubt
under
the
new
york
state
law
they
have
no
right
to
come
into
court
cases
even
when
this
law
gives
them
a
right
to
appear
at
a
regulatory
agency
hearing,
a
public
service
commission.
even
though
they
could
appear
at
that
hearing,
they
cannot
then
go
into
challenge
the
matter.
so,
i
emphasize
that
the
views
of
the
state
of
new
york
are
presented
by
the
attorney
general,
not
the
consumer
protection
board.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
in
response
to
the
respondentâs
argument,
early
on
there
was
mention
of
this
and
has
been
mentioned
again,
a
stipulation
about
class
action.
as
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court,
the
attorney
general
did
not
sign
this
and
many
other
parties
did
not
sign
this
so-called
class
action
stipulation.
so,
we
are
parties
to
this
case
so
these
other
people,
so
it
basically
is
inoperative.
furthermore,
and
i
think
i
should
emphasize
that
the
respondents
seems
to
be
saying
that
he
wants
the
warehouseman
to
bring
service
summonsing
complaint
and
bring
a
court
action.
as
has
been
pointed
out
i
think
in
our
brief
of
the
petition
of
flagg
brothers.
that
brings
into
play
when
the
sheriff
goes
out
to
execute
the
judgment
lien,
brings
into
play
the
question
of
the
household
goods
exemption
provided
by
new
york
state
statute
and
makes
a
world
of
problems
which
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
into
now.
now,
i
think
once
again,
there
is
a
claim
here
that
there
is
not
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
well,
the
claim
as
i
now
hear
it
that
there
is
no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
he
says
he
has
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
sale.
well
that
is
questionable,
but
what
i
wish
to
emphasize
to
your
honors
is
that
the
sale
is
not
such
a
significant
event.
the
customer
can
be
heard
before
the
sale
if
he
has
a
vigorous
attorney
and
that
he
wants
to
be
heard
before
the
sale
seeking
an
injunction
of
the
like
or
he
can
be
heard
as
he
very
frequently
is
after
the
sale
claiming
an
action
in
conversion
of
the
sale
was
not
properly
conducted
and
a
like.
this
is
a
complete
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
once
again
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
personal
property
and
you
use
the
term
irreplaceable.
i
would
say
with
personal
property
it
can
be
replaced
by
money.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
any
of
these
matters
--
and
by
the
way,
i
would
also
say
that
these
are
stored
goods
also.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
right.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
that
raises
another
issue
which
is
not
in
the
case.
that
raises
the
issue
of
general
non-possessory
liens
which
is
a
totally
different
problem
from
the
warehouseman
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
do
not
think
that
question
is
before
us,
but
i
would
say
that
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
authorize
someone
to
do
a
wrongful
act.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
say
that
where
a
state
official
does
not
participate,
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
find
state
action
and
racial--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
basically
you
might
never
find
unless
it
is
a
racial
discrimination
case
or
a
classic
governmental
function.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
but
i
do
not
think
you
get
very
far
relying
on
such
a
law
and
of
course
such
a
law
has
never
been
passed.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
that
is
not
my
position
here
because
the
type
of
lien
where
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
it
has
a
lot
to
do
because
you
have
to
focus
upon
the
type
of
lien
that
the
warehouseman
has.
he
has
a
lien
by
the
voluntary,
there
is
a
question
basically
by
the
delivery
by
the
customer,
a
property
for
moving
and
storage
to
the
warehouseman.
the
customer
wants
to
have
his
goods
taken
care
of
and
not
surprisingly,
the
warehouseman
expects
to
be
paid.
the
law
provides
a
lien
for
this
surface.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
put
it
this
way
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
traditional
state
function.
the
best
example
is
racial
discrimination
or
say
free
speech,
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
what?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
not
like.
no,
i
would
say
not
like.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
do
not
think
due
process
would
help
him.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that
giving
him
due
process
would
be
a
illusory
benefit
because
due
process
as
we
all
know
has
and
have
in
this
case
a
very
substantial
cost
and
in
the
end,
the
person
who
is
going
to
pay
this
cost
is
the
customer
and
we
are
dealing
here
allegedly
with
people
who
do
not
have
a
lot
of
money.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
now,
he
has
never
yet.
well,
in
the
end
he
will
pay
for
it
because
the
bill
that
he
is
going
receive
in
the
first
instance
is
going
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
that
is
a
fact
that
this
court
has
considered
in
its
other
cases.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
because
you
are
on
the
state
action
issue.
you
are
not
on
the
due
process
issue.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
because
we
actually
had
that
case
with
our
no
fault
law
and
i
think
it
was
appealed
up
to
this
court
where
we
under
no
fault
insurance
provision,
we
provided
that
any
dispute
about
no
fault,
the
benefits
or
the
insurance
is
subject
to
binding
arbitration.
it
basically
was
taken
out
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
because
we
do
have
a
lot
of
congestion
in
our
courts
and
i
think
that
is
the
example
that
is
operative
in
that
situation.
thank
you,
your
honors.
