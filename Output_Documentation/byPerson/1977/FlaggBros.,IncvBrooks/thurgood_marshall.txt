justice
thurgood
marshall
the
choice
was
either
give
it
to
him
or
leave
it
out
on
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
had
been
a
lot
(inaudible)
with
them
since
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
greewald
you
are
down
to
five
minutes.
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
chief
justice's
question's
mootness.
as
i
understand,
that
mrs.
jones
paid
the
money
and
that
the
only
by
agreement
they
removed
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
woman
had,
it
seems
to
me
that
woman
i
think
it
was
who
paid
$16,00.00
is
not
automatically
in
danger
of
not
being
able
to
pay
storage
in
the
future.
she
paid
$16,00.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
know
but
she
did
got
together
$16,00.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
can
consider
unless
it
was
not
certified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
do
agree
that
there
is
a
lien,
in
common
law
there
was
a
lien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
a
lien
mean
that
you
can
sell
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
and
he
can
go
to
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
about
the
provision
in
the
contract
that
they
had
this
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
is
not
a
warehouse
lien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
a
warehouse
lien
good
one
do
to
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
mean
there
was
no
coercion
that
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
valid
is
the
word
that
decides
it
whether
or
not
it
is
valid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
he
said.
he
wants
a
little
due
process.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
does
not
object
to
you
giving
the
warehouseman
lien?
he
does
not
object
to
that.
he
objects
to
you
selling
the
property.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
granting
the
lien.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
asking
to
pay
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
a
man
wants
due
process,
do
not
tell
him
that
he
cannot
have
it
because
he
will
have
to
pay
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
we
have
to
consider
in
this
case?
