unknown
speaker
mr.
altman
in
that
connection,
just
as
a
matter
of
you
curiosity,
if
you
prevail
here
what
remedies
do
the
respondents
have
under
the
new
york
system
during
the
alleged
wrong.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
attack
here
on
the,
even
assuming
the
state
action,
there
is
no
attack
on
the
lien
itself,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
on
the
conferral
of
the
right
to
sell
and
in
fact
on
these
cases
there
was
no
sale
with
respect
to
either
one
of
the
named
parties
(voice
overlap)
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
did
the
bailor
sign
the
warehouse
receipt?
unknown
speaker
so,
how
could
it
be
a
contract
then?
unknown
speaker
but
not
a
writing
signed
by
the
party
to
be
charged?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
like
if
you
want
to
store
your
goods,
you
would
store
them
on
lease
terms
or
we
will
not
store
them
and
so
they
stored
the
goods,
that
is
what
it
amounts
to
us?
unknown
speaker
what
more
is
there,
in
this
case
at
least?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
(voices
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you
suggest
that
she
knew
anything?
you
had
any
notions
what
the
terms
where
when
he
took
the
goods
away.
it
was
an
emergency
as
you
said.
unknown
speaker
this
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
and
the
posture
of
the
case
therefore
is
that
we
assume
that
the
allegations
of
the
complain
are
all
true
and
it
is
taking
those
allegations.
there
is
no
contract
in
this
case.
the
question
is
as
you
quite
accurately
said
that
outset
of
your
argument
and
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
the
action
of
your
client
was
state
action?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
but
on
that
point
mr.
altman,
without
a
contract
and
without
a
statute,
you
think
your
client
would
have
gone
head
and
soul?
unknown
speaker
otherwise,
you
would
have
to
go
to
court
to
foreclosure
your
lien?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
i
guess
is
whether
it
is
under
color
of
state
law
in
the
sense
that
it
is
something
that
would
not
have
been
done
without
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no,
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
a
simple
enactment
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
anybody
who
thereafter
acts
under
its
provisions
just
by
reason
of
existence
of
the
law
that
that
private
person
is
not
acting
like
as
a
state,
that
is
your
point?
unknown
speaker
a
simple
enactment
of
the
law
does
not
make
the
action
of
mr.
flagg
and
flagg
brothers
a
state
action?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
not
of
state
action,
is
it
not,
the
question
whether
it
is
action
under
color
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
i
rather
thought
that
you
are
saying
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
two.
i
guess
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
well,
really
what
we
have
here
is
whether
we
are
relying
on
the
language
of
1983
or
whether
we
are
relying
on
the
language
of
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
could
be
a
difference,
but
perhaps
that
is
as
far
side
discussion.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
constitutional
right
unless
there
is
a
deprivation
by
the
state,
that
is
the
point.
unknown
speaker
deprivation
by
a
private
individual
is
not
a
violation
of
private
personâs
constitutional
right,
no
matter
how
gross
the
deprivation
might
be?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
phrase
it
down
mr.
greenwald,
we
have
an
amicus
brief
here
from
the
new
york
state
consumer
protection
board
taking
a
position
as
opposed
to
yours.
unknown
speaker
you
represent
the
state
of
new
york
and
this
is
a
state
agency
you
know
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
some
of
the
parties
stipulated
not
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
but
now
they
are.
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
not
stipulated.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
the
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
without
that
delegation,
where
would
the
power
of
sale
be?
unknown
speaker
and
goto
court,
he
could
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
some
respects
that
involves
almost
more
state
action
than
it
this,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
clear
in
common
law
that
this
power
of
sale
existed,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
consistent
argument
as
to
what
the
common
law
was
to
be
immaterial?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
all
that
the
state
law
said
is
that
bailor
or
bailee
situations,
we
will
go
just
by
the
contract
whatever
the
parties
agree
to.
so,
if
the
party
has
agreed
to
a
private
sale
that
would
be
state
authorization
of
a
private
sale
and
that
would
be
enough
for
you
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
does.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
comes
about
because
of
the
state
law
simply
authorizes
parties
to
agree
on
a
private
sale,
would
that
be
state
action?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
am.
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
says,
whatever
the
parties
agree
to
with
respect
to
a
private
sale
is
all
right
with
us,
that
is
what
the
statute
says
and
the
parties
agree
to
a
private
sale.
now,
is
the
state
involved
in
that?
unknown
speaker
valid,
you
have
automatically
had
reference
to
state
law
right
there.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
contend
that
the
actual
sale
is
an
act
by
the
state,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
by
the
state?
yes,
it
is
an
act
which
is
equivalent
to
the
exercise
of
sovereign
power.
it
is
something
which
we
contend.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
not
say
the
state
is
liable.
if
for
example,
the
person
misuses
the
power.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
that
this
defendant
has
liability
as
though
it
were
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
because
as
though
it
was
a
state?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
it
is
liable
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
for
the
foreclosures
done
by
a
sheriff
and
the
sheriff
was
out
and
if
he
absconds
though
or
if
he
does
something
wrong,
perhaps
you
could
sue
him
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
in
the
warehousemanâs
situation
if
the
private
seller
mis-performs,
can
you
sue
him
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
is
it
state
action
or
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
get
into
court
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
claiming
that
his
private
seller
was
exercising
state
power
and
therefore
should
answer
for
what?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
sheriff
when
he
is
making
the
sale
as
a
neutral,
but
when
the
sale
is
made
under
power
of
sale,
either
expressed
or
implied,
the
selling
official
is
not
a
neutral,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
would
your
theory
make
all
powers
of
sale
under
mortgages
and
trusts
both
real
and
personal
property
state
action?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
if
there
were
non-compliance
with
the
statutory
procedure,
say
the
failure
to
give
a
notice
statutory
required
something
like
that,
would
you
say
that
was
state
action?
unknown
speaker
could
you
sue
in
a
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
state
--
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
acts
without
the
statute,
without
complying
with
the
statute,
is
he
then
acting
under
color
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
really
asking
is,
is
it
your
position
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
of
every
case
arising
under
one
of
these
statutes
or
are
you
only
contending
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
a
constitutionality
of
the
basic
procedure,
i
guess
your
argument
is
former?
unknown
speaker
but
there
could
be
a
violation
of
due
process
resulting
from
the
failure
to
follow
the
state
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there
is
the
same
kind
of
state
action
whether
or
not
the
defendant
complies
with
the
statutory
procedure?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
one
case
he
is
acting
under
color
of
the
state
law
and
the
other
case
is
acting
contrary
to
the
state
law,
you
do
not
draw
distinction
--
unknown
speaker
well,
supposed
he
sells
at
am
unconstitutionally
low
price
to
his
brother-in-law,
and
he
just
steals.
now,
he
is
exercising
the
state
authority
you
say
and
so
you
could
sue
him
under
1983
and
recover
damages?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
because
--
unknown
speaker
because
he
is
exercising,
at
the
threshold
he
is
exercising
--
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
deprived
him
of
his
property
without
due
process?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
are
you
contending
that
your
adversary
violated
the
statute
in
anyway?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
do
not
have
a
problem
of
whether
or
not
a
violation
of
the
statute
could
be
the
state
act?
unknown
speaker
do
the
members
of
the
class
that
was
stipulated,
are
they
all
parties
who
had
no
contracts?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
after
his
property,
perhaps
personal,
irreplaceable
personal
property
has
been
sold?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
family
portraits
and
so
on
cannot
be?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
really
to
the
question
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process
rather
than
the
state
action
issue
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
on
the
state
action
issue?
i
have
been
sometimes
a
hypothetical,
i
will
illustrate
the
position.
supposing
new
york
passed
a
statute
that
said
if
a
man
is
large
enough
and
strong
enough,
he
can
go
next
door
and
take
his
neighborâs
chattels,
his
lawnmower
or
one
thing
or
another
and
he
has
the
power
to
sell
them
to
a
third
party
and
get
good
title
and
some
one
does
that
pursuant
to
that
statute.
could
you
get
federal
jurisdiction
to
challenge
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
asking
under
that
hypothetical,
do
you
think
the
man
would
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
question
is
how
do
we
decide
when
state
action
is
involved,
an
action
is
authorized
by
a
statute,
but
no
state
official
participates?
is
it
your
view
that
unless
a
state
official
participates,
there
is
never
a
state
action?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
find,
that
is
the
question?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
that
in
my
case,
there
would
be
no
state
action.
i
think
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
you
admit
that
you
would
be
able
to
rely
on
federal
court,
you
could
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction,
is
that
not
your
position
here?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
whether
the
private
individual
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
greater,
legal
involvement,
there
is
less
state
action?
i
do
not
understand.
