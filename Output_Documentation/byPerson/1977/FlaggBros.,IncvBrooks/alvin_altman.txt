mr.
alvin
altman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
state
action
in
the
sale
by
a
warehouseman
of
household
goods,
a
sale
of
the
household
goods
deposited
by
a
warehouse
depositor
who
has
defaulted
in
payment
of
the
storage
charges,
the
sale
being
made
pursuant
to
new
york
uniform
commercial
code
section
7-210.
the
petitioner
is
the
warehouseman.
respondents
are
two
depositors
of
warehouse
household
goods
while
the
facts
in
each
case
are
not
identical,
they
are
substantially
similar.
both
respondents,
tenants
in
an
apartment
dwelling
in
mount
vernon,
new
york
were
evicted
from
their
respective
apartments
by
a
court
order.
on
the
day
of
the
eviction,
the
petitioner
warehouseman
acting
on
behalf
of
the
landlord,
the
evicting
landlord,
to
effectuate
the
removal
of
the
household
goods
from
the
apartment
to
the
sidewalk
appeared
at
the
apartment
and
entered
into
discussions
with
the
respondents.
i
may
point
out
to
the
court
that
these
two
occasions
did
not
occur
on
the
same
day,
there
were
separate
occasions
on
different
days.
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
in
the
brookâs
case,
respondent
brooks
requested
that
her
household
effects
be
removed
from
the
apartment
to
the
petitionerâs
warehouse
rather
than
leaving
the
goods
on
the
sidewalk.
in
the
jonesa
case,
the
respondent
jones
was
present
with
the
warehouseman
in
the
apartment
at
the
time
of
discussion,
made
a
call
to
the
department
of
social
services
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
approval
for
getting
funds
to
pay
the
transportation
charges
and
to
pay
storage
charges.
this
was
confirmed
by
letter
of
the
department
of
social
services.
the
department
of
social
services
approved
one
monthâs
storage.
after
a
period
of
time
elapsed,
both
accounts
became
in
arrears
and
the
warehouseman
threatened
to
sell
in
conformity
with
section
7-210.
respondents
sought
an
injunction
relief
and
a
declaration
from
the
united
states
district
court
that
section
7-210
was
unconstitutional
being
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
the
district
court
on
motion
of
the
warehouseman
dismissed
the
case
on
the
ground
that
state
action
was
not
present.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
since
the
bedrock
principle
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
prohibition
against
state
action
and
not
individual
action,
no
matter
how
harmful
or
hurtful,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
of
new
york
was
so
involved
in
the
sale
that
the
action
of
the
warehouseman
maybe
fairly
treated
as
the
action
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
alvin
altman
if
we
prevailed
here,
your
honor,
the
remedies
of
the
respondents
are
of
course
to
go
into
court
to
enjoin
any
action
in
which
they
feel
the
warehouseman
has
not
complied
with
the
rigorous
safeguards
of
the
statute.
mr.
alvin
altman
they
have
an
action
for
damages
mr.
chief
justice
for
any
infraction
of
the
statute,
no
matter
how
minute,
and
they
have
an
action
for
conversion
in
the
event
that
the
infractions
are
willful
one.
mr.
alvin
altman
well,
that
is
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
of
course
in
addition
they
have
taken
the
position
that
the
conferral
of
the
right
of
sale
upon
the
warehouseman
is
an
action
associated
with
sovereignty,
is
a
right
associated
with
sovereignty
(voice
overlap).
mr.
alvin
altman
yes
sir.
mr.
alvin
altman
yes
sir.
mr.
alvin
altman
no,
your
honor.
the
only
attack
is
on
the
conferral
of
the
right
of
sale.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
altman
in
the
one
case,
mr.
justice
powell,
there
was
a
storage
receipt;
a
warehouse
receipt
which
we
claim
has
all
of
the
elements
of
the
contract
in
it.
mr.
alvin
altman
the
warehouse
receipt
of
the
particular
petitioner
warehouseman
and
there
is
also
a
warehouse
receipt
which
is
used
more
commonly
throughout
the
industry
so
the
court
has
before
it
the
receipt
issued
in
this
particular
case
plus
the
receipt
which
is
in
common
usage.
mr.
alvin
altman
not
in
those
words
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
altman
there
is
a
provision
in
that
warehouse
receipt
which
confers
the
right
of
sale
by
the
warehouseman
in
the
event
of
the
default
in
payment.
however,
there
is
no
specific
pointing
out
of
section
7-210.
mr.
alvin
altman
we
believe
that
you
can
rely
on
that
contract.
of
course
in
this
case
if
i
may
point
out
your
honor,
we
have
a
special
situation
in
that
it
was
an
emergency
situation.
it
was
not
the
normal
time
to
prepare
the
storage
contract,
the
warehouse
receipt
in
the
ordinary
case
where
there
is
a
removal
to
storage.
this
was
an
emergency
whereby
the
goods
were
being
removed
to
the
sidewalk
and
in
order
to
prevent
that,
the
warehouseman
took
the
goods
into
storage.
mr.
alvin
altman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
altman
we
submit
that
there
was
an
implied
contract
based
on
all
of
the
facts
in
this
instance.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
altman
not
quite
your
honor
if
i
may
disagree.
mr.
alvin
altman
well,
there
was
the
right
--
mr.
alvin
altman
right,
there
was
the
right
of
the
bailor
to
obtain
different
warehouseman
if
she
did
not
agree
to
the
terms
specified
by
this
particular
warehouseman.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
altman
or
i
try
to
obtain
the
services
of
another
warehouseman
and
that
is
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
alvin
altman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
alvin
altman
well,
your
honor
we
imply
it
first
because
the
statute
itself
should
be
considered
and
the
statute
itself
should
be
considered
in
the
terms
of
the
contract.
that
is
one
way
and
then
we
say
your
honor
that
this
a
--
mr.
alvin
altman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
it
is
definitely
a
limitation.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
could
very
well
be
done
and
that
is
the
case
mr.
justice
powell.
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
warehouse
deposits,
the
contract
is
specific
on
this
point,
the
documentation
the
warehouse
receipt
of
the
storage
contract.
it
so
happens
in
this
particular
case
that
was
not
done
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
alvin
altman
yes
sir.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct
sir.
we
respectfully
submit
that
state
involvement
in
a
disputed
private
act
must
be
significant,
affirmative,
all
but
ordering
the
challenged
activity
and
that
the
delegation
of
sovereign
power
in
economic
due
process
setting
is
insufficient
to
cross
the
state
action
threshold.
we
would
point
out
that
new
york
commercial
code
is
a
permissive
statute.
there
is
no
direction
in
the
statute
to
sell.
the
decision
to
sell
is
the
decision
of
the
warehouseman.
it
is
a
private
decision
arrived
at
by
a
private
party
in
a
private
transaction
with
no
state
official
being
present.
no
state
encouragement
whatsoever.
mr.
alvin
altman
without
a
contract
and
without
the
statute
--
mr.
alvin
altman
yes,
it
is.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
altman
that
is
right
sir
and
on
that
issue,
may
i
say
that
the
conferral
of
this
right
of
sale
is
not
the
delegation
of
a
power
associated
with
sovereignty.
far
from
being
a
power
associated
with
sovereignty,
this
statute
is
a
codification
of
a
power
to
dispose
a
property
which
any
private
property
had
a
common
law.
the
power
of
sale
was
an
attribute
of
ownership
and
a
common
law
possession
was
deemed
to
be,
was
presumed
to
be
ownership.
mr.
alvin
altman
the
bailee
could
sell
the
property
under
common
law
if
possession
had
been
voluntarily
delivered
to
him,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
alvin
altman
yes
sir.
mr.
alvin
altman
in
so
far
as
a
seizure
is
not
concerned
in
this
case,
in
so
far
as
possession
was
delivered
voluntarily,
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
any
difference.
