justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
really
all
the
respondents
are
complaining
about
is
that
the
ucc
gives
your
client
an
additional
defense
to
a
claim
for
a
conversion
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
ucc
were
not
even
in
existence,
and
that
there
was
nothing
on
the
books
at
all
with
respect
to
what
a
warehouseman
could
dom
common
law
or
statutory
law,
presumably
if
the
warehouseman
without
any
contractual
right
to
do
so,
took
a
bailorâs
goods
out
and
sold
them,
the
bailor
could
sue
for
conversion,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
ucc
simply
says
if
you
follow
this
what
you
have
described
as
rigorous
procedures
and
i
presume
your
opponent
characterizes
them
otherwise,
you
will
have
a
defense
to
that
state
court
action
posiibly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
the
statute
a
fairly
important
part
of
the
whole
picture?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
if
i
may
mr.
altman.
so,
supposing
that
contrary
to
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
at
common
law,
the
bailee
had
absolutely
no
power
to
sell
without
going
to
court,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
without
any
statute,
all
it
said,
âwe
are
not
going
to
follow
that
branch
of
the
common
law.
we
are
going
to
enunciate
a
new
principle
that
the
bailee
does
have
the
power
to
sell.
so
that
without
statute,
but
as
a
result
of
decisional
law
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
your
client
would
have
the
same
right
as
now
conferred
on
it
by
statute,
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
any
different
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
not
have
to
have
both
here
as
a
matter
of
fact?.
you
have
to
have
under
color
of
state
law
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
and
the
constitutional
right
is
that
you
are
not
be
deprived
of
due
process
by
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
difference
does
it
make
when
new
york
first
enacted
the
statute?
supposing
that
there
was
no
statute
on
the
books
and
no
decisional
law
and
new
york
had
just
become
a
member
of
the
union
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
first
established
and
had
no
cases
at
all
on
this
subject,
and
this
precise
case
came
before
it?
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
to
decide
one
way
or
another
whether
the
bailee
had
a
right
to
sell
without
going
the
court,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
a
state
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
claim
of
state
action
based
on
the
legislature's
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
supposing
that
without
any
such
statute,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
common
law
had
reached
precisely
the
same
result?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
not
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
it
is
the
any
recognition
by
a
body
in
new
york
that
is
capable
of
laying
down
law
that
a
warehouseman
has
a
defense
to
a
conversion
action
in
this
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
say
delegation
of
sovereign
power
but
all
that
really
is
a
defense
to
a
conversion
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in
a
conversion
action,
the
goods
may
have
been
taken
without
a
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
gives
them
a
defense
to
an
otherwise
unlawful
act
to
where
the
conversion
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
as
if
a
converter
takes
your
goods
and
does
away
with
them
and
you
never
sue
him,
he
gets
away
scot
free?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
whole
source
of
enforcement
of
law
for
contracts
is
the
state
sovereignty
under
austin
or
anybody
else.
in
many
societies
a
written
agreement
between
two
parties
is
not
enforced
by
the
sovereign.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
your
argument
not
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
you
could
have
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
bailor
and
bailee
here
which
did
not
comply
with
the
ucc
provision,
but
was
perfectly
valid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
it
was
entirely
consensual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
supposing
it
is
invalid
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
is
just
not
any
consensual
agreement
that
it
gets
you
at
the
the
warehouseman
out
from
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
here.
it
has
to
be
not
only
consensual,
but
it
must
also
comply
with
the
state
statute
which
you
say
has
delegated
to
the
warehouseman,
the
stateâs
ordinary
function?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
test
to
the
one
there
is
state
action
in
the
case
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenwald,
what
if
the
new
york
legislature
decided
that
the
courts
of
new
york
were
so
congested
that
they
just
had
to
eliminate
some
claims
for
relief
and
they
decided
to
eliminate
any
civil
action
for
conversion.
do
you
think
that
would
implicate
state
actions
so
that
someone
who
had
previously
had
a
claim
for
conversion
could
go
into
the
district
court
and
say
the
state
has
taken
away
my
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
third
of
the
cases
are
consolidated
number
7725,
37
and
42
flagg
brothers
incorporate
versus
brooks.
and
these
come
to
us
from
the
second
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
new
york
law
grants
a
warehouseman,
a
lien
for
storage
charges,
upon
goods
in
his
possession
and
permits
him
to
enforce
the
lien
under
specified
circumstances
by
selling
the
stored
goods.
in
this
case
petitioner
flagg
brothers
were
a
warehouseman
threatened
to
sell
respondent's
belongings
when
they
fail
to
pay
charges
claimed
to
be
due.
the
respondents
who
had
stored
the
furniture
there
upon
sought
damages
and
injunctive
relief
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
the
ground
that
the
sale
would
deprive
them
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
for
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
holding
that
the
statute
delegated
to
flagg
brothers,
the
warehouseman
in
this
case,
an
exclusive
functions
of
the
state,
and
therefore
flagg
brothers
action
was
--
could
be
challenged
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondents
who
where
the
people
that
stored
the
furniture
contended
the
binding
consensual
resolution
of
disputes
or
i
should
say
non-consensual
resolution
of
disputes.
since
flagg
brothers
here
went
ahead
and
exercised
an
authority
to
sell
after
failure
to
pay,
is
a
power
that
has
been
traditionally
exclusively
reserved
to
the
state.
they
ask
us
to
expand
the
public
function
doctrine
under
which
we
have
previously
found
state
action
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
when
private
parties
have
conducted
elections
or
performed
all
the
essential
functions
of
municipality.
however
in
the
area
of
commercial
relations
between
debtors
and
creditors.
the
state
has
not
traditionally
monopolized
the
mechanisms
of
dispute
resolution
but
has
recognized
the
availability
of
wide
assortment
of
self
help
remedies.
this
statute
doesn't
depart
significantly
from
these
traditional
remedies
and
we
decline
to
apply
the
public
function
doctrine
here.
the
active
involvement
of
state
official
which
has
been
shown
in
each
of
our
previous
decisions,
which
have
imposed
procedural
limitations
on
creditors
remedies
is
not
present
here.
the
prohibitions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
therefore
do
not
apply
to
the
essentially
private
action
of
warehouseman
such
as
flagg
brothers.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
