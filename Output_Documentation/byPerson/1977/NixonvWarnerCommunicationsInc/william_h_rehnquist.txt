justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jeffress,
you
said
the
ultimate
question,
but
it
may
not
be
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case
is
varied
depending
on
the
stage
of
other
proceedings
in
the
courts
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
then
that
even
under
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts,
presume
the
housekeeping
authority
to
decide
what
shall
be
done
with
exhibits
until
they
are
returned
or
exhibits
that
may
not
be
the
property
of
any
one
individual,
it
would
not
have
the
authority
to
grant
the
request
of
these
respondents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
releasing
court
is
not
deciding
as
to
the
propriety
or
the
action
ability
of
the
use
that
may
be
made
of
the
tape
after
its
release.
it
is
simply
authorizing
the
copying
of
something
that
is
in
its
custody.
if
the
people
who
get
it
out
of
the
custody,
use
it
in
a
manner
that
infringes
someone’s
right
of
privacy,
it
may
be
actionable,
but
is
that
a
decision
that
ought
to
be
made
by
the
court
that
simply
has
custody
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
really
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse,
it
puts
all
the
constitutional
freight
really
on
the
custodial
court
rather
than
it
seems
to
me,
it
might
be
much
simpler
to
just
look
at
this
as
a
problem
of
custody,
copying
by
joe
dokes
or
by
nbc
of
something
that
is
in
custody
and
let
the
subsequent
transactions
in
connection
with
the
tape
carry
the
constitutional
freight?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
property
at
this
point
or
is
there
because
the
congress
in
effect
condemned
the
originals
and
under
the
act
we
construed
last
spring?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
mr.
nixon
did
have
title
to
those
tapes,
congress
is
provided
just
compensation
for
them
in
that
act,
so
he
would
have
no
property
claim
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
quarrel
with
judge
gesell’s
suggestion
that
whatever
plan
that
you
came
up
with,
you
had
to
pay
for
the
time
or
clerk
of
the
court
and
that
you
could
not
just
turn
the
court
into
an
annex
of
cbs
in
order
to
get
the
tapes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure
how
my
brother
brennan
reacts
to
your
answer
to
his
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
good
answer,
exactly
the
opposite
to
which
you
gave
could
be
made
that
an
exhibit
furnished
by
a
third
party
and
simply
drawn
into
court
by
judicial
process,
perhaps
ought
to
have
more
protection
from
dissemination
than
the
proceedings
of
a
public
body
that
are
pursuant
to
rule
and
that
do
not
involve
any
unwilling
participation
by
a
third
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
get
to
a
constitutional
question?
is
it
not
both
cases
basically
are
housekeeping
question
of
what
a
particular
court
is
going
to
do
with
material
that
happens
to
be
physically
in
its
possession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
response
to
justice
stevens’s
question
mr.
williams,
you
referred
to
mr.
nixon’s
right
to
claim
embarrassment.
do
you
think
he
has
the
right
to
assert
similar
claims
or
contentions
on
behalf
of
people
whose
voices
might
be
heard
on
the
tapes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
going
to
try
to
plead
this
decree
then
as
a
defense
to
whatever
use
or
any
suits
that
might
arise
out
your
subsequent
use
of
the
material,
this
is
just
a
question
whether
you
get
access
not
to
your
total
right
to
use
it
for
whatever
purpose
you
see
fit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
not
the
act
that
we
had
before
us
last
spring
effect
at
least
the
property
claim
that
your
client
might
otherwise
assert?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
distinguishing
between
property
and
title?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
we
are
talking
not
just
about
a
housekeeping
policy,
the
court
or
gsa
is
going
to
make
its
decision
dependent
on
what
the
housekeeping
policy
of
the
clerks’
office
of
the
district
of
columbia
is?
