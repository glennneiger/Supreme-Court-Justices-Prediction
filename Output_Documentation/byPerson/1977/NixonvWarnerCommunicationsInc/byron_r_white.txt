justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
portions
of
the
tapes
that
were
not
played
to
the
jury,
are
not
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
they
not
have
a
right
to
them,
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
they
were
subpoenaed?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
why
they
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
still
drawing
the
distinction
between
the
transcript
which
is
readily
available
to
any
attorney
and
the
original
tape
with
all
the
voice
inflections
and
everything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
abrams,
how
about
my
question
to
jeffress
on
the
parts
of
the
tapes
of
the
original
tapes
or
the
parts
of
the
copies
of
the
tapes
that
were
not
played
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
subpoenaed?
they
were
lodged
in
court
and
they
are
still
there,
are
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
the
tapes
you
are
after
they
are
in
his
vault?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
is
whether
they
are
public
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
two,
the
parts
that
were
played
to
the
jury
and
the
parts
that
were
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
were
admitted,
in
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all
as
far
as
you
go
on
exhibits?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
theory
only
go
that
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
we
seal?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
copyright
laws?
suppose
it
was
a
copyrighted
material
that
was
introduced
in
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
claim
a
constitutional
right
to
get
these
tapes?
justice
byron
r.
white
cox
did
not
hold
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
cox
did
not
go
that
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
a
normal
practice
is
that
court
exhibits
are
returned
to
their
source
when
a
case
is
over.
well,
these
cases
are
over.
suppose
the
exhibits
had
been
returned
and
then
you
wanted
to
get
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
judgment
when
the
cases
were
still
going
on
and
it
said,
normally,
the
exhibits
are
returned
when
the
cases
are
over.
well,
the
case
is
over,
they
have
not
been
returned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
common
law
for
the
federal
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
federal
common
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
validity
of
that
rule
against
access
to
the
oral
recording?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
mr.
nixon
had
been
a
witness
in
this
case
and
had
objected
to
having
his
testimony
recorded
and
then
broadcast,
you
would
say
that
if
the
court
exceeded
his
request
and
forbade
publication,
you
would
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
court
said
mr.
nixon,
you
do
not
need
to
make
that
request
because
we
have
a
court
rule
that
we
do
not
turn
loose
any
of
our
oral
recordings
of
our
trials,
you
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
if
you
were
counsel
for
the
broadcasters
who
would
like
to
take
the
oral
transcript
and
broadcast
it,
the
oral
recording
and
broadcast
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
the
essence
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
defense
you
are
plugging
for
would
i
suppose
cover
that
situation
where
the
words,
the
voices,
or
whatever
is
said
is
not
inculpatory
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
really
is
not
the
point
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
that
the
publication
might
be
extremely
embarrassing,
but
it
might
not
be
inculpatory
in
the
sense
of
being
criminal
or
indicating
any
guilt.
it
is
just
embracing
and
your
principle
would
cover
--
