justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
not
all
lost,
once
they
were
played
in
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
lost
to
12
people,
the
12
people
on
the
jury
heard
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
not
think
that
means
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
no
longer
private,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
what
are
you
are
arguing,
limit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
all
been
released
to
the
“public?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
there
be
a
difference
in
the
courtroom
with
12
people,
the
courtroom
that
held
200
people,
would
it
be
more
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
reason
that
the
respondents
want
to
reproduce
it
for
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
larger
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is,
it
has
already
been
released?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
that
is
true,
why
do
you
make
a
motion
to
seal
the
record?
that
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule,
is
it
not
correct,
sealing
the
record
is
exception
and
not
the
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
do
you
do
that
if
it
is
already
sealed?
you
said
it
is
already
sealed,
you
cannot
copy
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
if
you
are
go
into
the
clerk's
office
and
say
i
want
to
see
the
exhibits
and
said
that
is
a
case,
they
just
hand
it
to
you
and
you
are
allowed
to
copy
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
at
trademark
and
copyright
cases,
where
even
the
pleadings
are
secret
and
are
sealed,
even
the
pleadings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
public
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reporters
who
heard
it
could
not
print
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
a
public
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
it
that
the
court
did
not
restrict
the
tapes
in
court
and
allowed
them
to
be
played
rather
than
to
transcript?
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
to
my
original
discussion
with
you
then
not
only
the
transcript
was
released
from
privacy,
but
also
the
voices
were
released
from
privacy,
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
not
have
ruled
that
you
did
not
need,
you
should
be
satisfied
with
the
transcript,
but
the
court
said
you
needed
both,
did
the
court
not
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
court
did
say
that
these
could
be
played
to
the
audience
and
everybody
in
that
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
made
it
to
that
extent
public?
