chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-944,
nixon
against
warner
communication
and
others.
mr.
jeffress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
involved
is
the
22
hours
of
electronic
transcription
that
were
introduced
as
evidence
in
the
trial
before
judge
sirica,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
the
material
that
would
take
seven
man
days
to
reproduce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
could
release
them
if
we
decided
to
do
so
for
playing
on
the
6:00
news
tonight
as
occurred
or
7:00
news
whenever
it
comes
on,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
court
has
never
had
any
occasion
to
decide
whether
a
defendant
can
refuse
or
a
witness
can
refuse
to
appear
if
the
proceeding
is
broadcast,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
jeffress.
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
more
authority,
you
do
not
--
that
does
not
sound
as
though
you
concede
we
have
cleaner,
total
and
final
authority,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
perhaps
because
you
get
them
before
they
got
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
williams,
suppose
you
have
a
celebrated
criminal
case,
kidnapping,
rape,
murder,
something
of
that
kind
and
one
of
the
elements
of
evidence
introduced
into
trial
are
statements
made
which
in
the
aggregate
amount
to
a
confession
by
the
defendant
or
one
of
the
defendants
at
some
point,
at
least
at
a
point
where
the
court
admits
them
in
evidence
and
he
makes
--
these
statements
that
are
all
in
record
now
in
the
trial,
not
subpoenaed
in
the
ordinary
sense,
but
produced
by
the
prosecution.
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
made
outside
of
court,
perhaps
at
the
time
when
he
was
in
custody
or
perhaps
not,
but
anyway,
they
are
received
in
evidence.
they
are
on
the
record
with
the
tape
recording
of
the
trial
and
in
the
written
transcript.
now,
then
the
jury
acquits
the
defendant
and
the
conclusion
then,
efforts
are
made
as
are
made
here
to
produce
them
for
broadcasting,
for
tape
recording
to
juxtapose
the
admissions,
the
confession
against
the
jury’s
verdict.
do
you
think
that
would
be
subject
to
being
broadcast
or
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
see
any
difference
from
the
voice
and
the
printed
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
after
that,
after
the
jury
acquits
this
person,
the
judge,
as
some
judges
have
been
known
to
do,
excoriates
the
jury,
a
matter
in
which
as
we
know
in
the
code
of
professional
conduct
is
discouraged
if
not
forbidden,
would
the
members
of
the
jury
have
any
basis
for
stopping
the
broadcasting
of
the
judge’s
denunciation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
after
then
in
this
hypothetical
case,
the
court
having
denounced
and
excoriated
the
jury,
which
has
found
the
defendant
not
guilty
and
thereby
discharging
them,
the
court
then
proceeds
to
denounce
and
excoriate
the
defendant
himself.
you
would
say
then
too
that
is
available
for
broadcasting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might,
suppose
the
congress
enacted
a
statute
saying
that
all
such
records
of
arguments
here
be
made
public
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
we
of
course
might
have
further
recourse
to
say
then
the
recordings
will
not
be
made,
is
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
copy,
you
do
mean
the
precise
oral
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
super
embarrassment
of
the
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
really
what
mr.
justice
powell
is
asking
you
about
though.
he
was
asking
you
about
material
that
is
actually
admitted
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
position
not
in
parts
assume
something
of
this
nature
that
if
the
courtroom
holds
130
people
and
130
are
entitled
to
hear
everything
that
goes
on
as
they
are,
but
that
means
there
is
some
constitutional
right
of
13
million
people
to
hear
it
by
way
of
the
reproduction
of
the
recording,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
then
return
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
hypothetical
and
you
have
a
divorce
proceeding
between
two
internationally
prominent
people
known
all
over
the
world
and
the
man
is
a
prominent
political
or
other
prominent
public
figure,
and
we
reverse
the
rules
that
sometimes
apparently
occur
and
we
have
the
husband
suing
the
wife
for
divorce
on
the
grounds
of
misconduct
with
respect
to
her
visits
to
some
gentleman’s
establishment,
gentleman’s
apartment
and
unknown
to
her,
all
of
the
conversations
were
recorded
by
this
third
party,
ungallant
as
that
might
be,
and
the
husband
finds
out
about
it
and
subpoenas
them.
now,
you
have
the
subpoenaed
material
brought
into
the
courtroom
going
one
step
beyond
your
response
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
just
now,
and
now
that
is
available
too
for
all
the
networks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
gentlemen
whose
conversations
i
am
mentioning
is
not
inculpated
in
any
way,
he
is
just
somewhat
guilty,
but
a
third
party
bystander
so
far
as
the
trial
is
concerned,
his
voice
and
his
conversations
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
not
charged
with
anything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
third
party
whose
conversations
are
being
produced
in
litigation
between
a
husband
and
a
wife.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
unless
–
i
do
not
like
to
prolong
this
unduly,
but
[laughter]
let
us
change
this
and
it
is
the
husband,
the
trial
having
been
concluded
and
the
matter
having
been
terminated,
it
was
the
husband
who
does
not
want
to
further
embarrass
himself
or
his
wife
or
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
a
little
late
in
my
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
williams.
mr.
jeffress,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
these
tapes
now
been
delivered
to
the
gsa
pursuant
to
the
opinions
of
sometime
ago
last
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
for
a
moment
that
they
were
in
the
possession
of
gsa
and
not
of
the
clerk,
would
the
gsa
be
a
necessary
party
to
any
effort
to
reproduce
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
76-944,
nixon
against
warner
communications
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
