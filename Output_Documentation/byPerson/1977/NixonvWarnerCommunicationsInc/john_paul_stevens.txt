justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
make
sure
of
one
thing?
what
is
at
issue
here,
the
underlying
tapes
that
were
filed
or
is
it
just
the
composite
that
was
made
by
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
not
a
court
copy,
it
is
an
extract
and
are
the
original
tapes
involved
at
all?
if
you
lose
this
case,
will
the
underlying
tapes
be
covered
by
the
judgment,
what
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jeffress
may
ask
you
a
question
about
how
to
go
about
deciding
this
case.
i
gather
you
would
agree
that
in
some
instances
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
public
copying
and
access
to
exhibits
and
others
it
is
not,
depending
on
the
impact
on
the
privacy
of
the
witness
or
the
person
producing
the
exhibit.
i
think
that
is
implicit
in
your
argument.
if
that
is
true
how
is
the
one
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
release
something
like
this
without
hearing
it
and
that
then
leaves
the
question
should
we
not
have
some
kind
of
obligation
to
defer
to
the
district
court
which
has
heard
these
materials
which
we
have
not
heard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
stop
you
for
a
moment?
you
say
the
general
rule
is
that
no
copying
is
permitted
except
in
exceptional
circumstances
because
judge
gesell
certainly
thought
the
law
was
to
the
contrary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
different
for
tape
recordings
and
for
any
other
document
or
pictures
or
anything
like
that,
should
you
have
a
general
rule
to
find
all
exhibits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
they
be
given
that
right?
you
say
that
is
an
insufficient
basis
for
an
objection
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
bother
with
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
williams
and
broadcast?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
williams,
do
you
adhere
to
your
answer
that
you
gave
me
earlier
that
embarrassment
is
never
a
valid
reason
for
denying
access?
justice
john
paul
stevens
never
a
reason
unless
it
is
pornographic,
you
know,
that
is
a
pretty
severe,
it
has
to
go
pretty
far
to
get
something
pornographic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
limit
to
even
balance
embarrassment
against
other
considerations.
you
would
simply
say
embarrassment
of
a
witness
or
a
third
party
is
never
a
valid
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
additional
embarrassment
by
the
difference
between
the
different
kinds
of
“uh-uhs”
that
you
described.[laughter]
after
all,
you
whole
position
is
there
is
a
material
difference
between
reading
and
hearing.
like
material
prints
in
the
terms
of
embarrassment
as
well
as
public
interest?
