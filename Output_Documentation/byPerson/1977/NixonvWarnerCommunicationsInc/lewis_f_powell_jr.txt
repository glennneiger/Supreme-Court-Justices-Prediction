f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
jeffress,
who
in
general
were
parties
to
these
conversations
in
addition
to
the
president?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
any
parties
recorded
in
these
tapes
who
were
not
associated
with
the
white
house?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
jeffress,
your
arguments
being
recorded
on
that
machine
over
there,
are
you
suggesting
there
is
any
limitation
on
this
court
from
releasing
the
tape
of
your
argument
to
the
media
or
anyone
else?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
not
my
question.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
limitations
in
our
power
to
release
the
recording
of
your
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
is
this
any
different
from
the
recordings
we
are
talking
about?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
do
not
make
that
distinction
as
to
your
own
argument
here.
your
argument
is
being
recorded.
that
will
also
be
transcribed
and
there
will
be
a
transcript
of
it
after
this
argument.
do
you
still
suggest
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
our
power
to
release
the
voice
recording
with
all
its
inflections
and
every
thing
else
to
the
new
media
for
broadcast
tonight
if
they
wanted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
jeffress
i
do
know
there
are
some
states
that
televise
trial
proceedings
and
probably
this
had
been
a
televised
trial
so
that
the
recordings
that
are
at
issue
here
had
been
broadcast
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
would
you
still
be
making
the
argument
hereon?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
add
to
this
parade
of
horrible
examples
by
putting
one
more
to
you?
let
us
assume
that
instead
of
having
this
case,
we
had
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
domestic
litigation
between
let
us
better
say,
a
very
high
official
in
government
and
a
wife
internationally
known.
let
us
assume
further
that
you
had
tapes
of
various
lurid
indiscretions,
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
for
the
availability
of
those?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
my
example,
where
would
the
privilege
be
as
between
the
parties
to
this
divorce
litigation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
only
if
the
court
concluded
that
the
recordings
and
the
testimony
constituted
pornographic
material?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
former
president
nixon.
the
respondents
are
warner
communications
and
various
broadcasting
companies.
the
case
arose
at
the
trial
of
seven
of
petitioner's
former
advisors.
introduced
into
evidence
at
that
trial
were
some
22
hours
of
recordings,
copies
of
tapes
subpoenaed
from
petitioner.
petitioner
himself
was
not
a
defendant.
the
tapes
were
played
for
the
jury.
the
members
of
the
public
and
press
in
attendance
were
furnished
with
earphones
to
hear
them.
verbatim
transcripts
were
distributed
and
received
wide
spread
publicity
in
the
press
and
otherwise.
respondent
broadcasters
filed
a
motion
during
the
trial,
seeking
permission
to
copy,
broadcast
and
sell
reproduction
of
the
tapes.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reversed.
it
held
that
the
district
court
should
have
allowed
the
tapes
to
be
copied
immediately.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
holding.
the
parties
agree
that
there
is
a
common
law
right
to
inspect
and
copy
judicial
records,
constituting
evidence
in
a
public
trial,
but
the
right
is
not
absolute.
a
court
must
exercise
a
sound
discretion
as
to
whether
to
allow
copying
of
records
in
its
custody.
the
parties
here
have
advanced,
quite
ably
and
at
length,
reasons
for
and
against
permitting
copying
of
these
tapes
in
addition
to
the
transcripts
already
released.
i
will
not
detail
these
arguments
in
this
oral
statement
as
they
are
set
forth
fully
in
our
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
we
do
identify
one
unique
factor,
a
factor
we
consider
to
be
decisive
and
one
not
given
adequate
consideration
by
the
courts
below.
congress
has
enacted
the
presidential
recordings
act,
the
validity
of
which
we
sustained
last
term.
this
act
directs
the
administrator
of
general
services
to
take
custody
of
petitioner's
presidential
tapes
and
documents.
the
administrator
must
develop
and
implement
a
program
for
releasing
these
materials
to
the
public,
including
the
tapes.
the
act
expressly
provides
procedures
and
safeguards
designed
to
accommodate
the
public
interest
and
also
to
protect
whatever
rights
private
parties,
including
petitioner
maybe
able
successfully
to
assert.
we
think
the
existence
of
this
act
makes
it
inappropriate
for
a
court
to
release
the
copies
of
these
tapes
at
this
time.
congress
has
prescribed
specific
procedures
for
the
processing
and
release
of
all
of
president
nixon's
records,
including
the
originals
of
these
tapes.
the
policies
of
the
act
can
best
be
carried
out
under
the
act
itself.
respondent's
allege
as
independent
grounds
entitlement
to
immediate
release
under
the
first
and
sixth
amendments.
we
have
held
previously
that
the
media
has
no
right
to
information
about
a
public
trial
superior
to
that
of
the
general
public.
the
public
never
had
been
given
access
to
these
copies,
but
both
the
public
and
the
media
have
had
full
access
to
every
word
in
the
portions
of
these
tapes
played
at
the
trial
both
when
played
and
in
the
written
transcripts
thereof
that
were
released.
physical
custody
of
the
copies
of
these
tapes
always
has
remained
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
the
watergate
trial
was
a
public
trial
as
can
be
remembered.
it
certainly
was
one
of
the
most
publicized
in
the
history
of
our
country.
the
contents
of
these
tapes
have
continued
to
receive
via
distribution
free
of
any
restrain.
nor
does
our
decision
mean
that
the
tapes
themselves
will
not
in
due
time
be
made
available
for
commercial
replaying.
we
merely
hold
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
access
to
these
copies
on
demand.
we
further
hold,
in
light
of
the
plan
prescribed
by
congress
for
release
of
president
nixon's
records
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
a
court
to
bypass
that
plan.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
in
an
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
agrees
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
these
justices
however
do
not
join
in
the
court's
opinion.
they
would
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
deliver
the
copies
in
question
to
the
administrator
forthwith
to
be
process
and
made
available
under
the
act
in
the
same
manner
as
the
original
tapes.
mr.
justice
marshal
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
filed
separate
dissenting
opinions.
