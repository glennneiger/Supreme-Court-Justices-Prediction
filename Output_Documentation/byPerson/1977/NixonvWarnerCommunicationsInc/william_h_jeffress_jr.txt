mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
tapes
that
are
involved
in
this
case
were
those
that
were
produced
following
this
court’s
decision
for
use
as
evidence
in
the
watergate
trial.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
tapes
having
served
their
purpose
as
evidence
in
that
trial
will
now
be
distributed
by
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
to
members
of
the
public
for
broadcast,
for
sale
and
for
whatever
other
uses
that
members
of
the
public
may
wish
to
put
them.
the
case
started
when
just
prior
to
the
watergate
trial,
three
news
reporters
requested
judge
sirica
to
provide
copies
of
the
tapes
as
they
were
played
to
the
jury
during
the
trial.
judge
sirica
sought
the
guidance
of
the
chief
judge
who
consulted
other
members
of
the
district
court.
it
was
a
consensus
of
those
judges
of
the
district
court
that
while
the
ultimate
decision
ought
to
be
left
to
the
trial
judge,
providing
copies
of
the
tapes
to
the
media
would
appear
first
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
court’s
rule
against
the
broadcast
and
dissemination
of
the
recording
via
court
reporter
of
trial
proceedings
and
second,
it
was
the
consensus
of
the
judges
that
dissemination
of
the
transcripts
to
the
public
would
appear
to
constitute
more
than
adequate
disclosure
of
what
the
tapes
contain.
judge
sirica
agreed
with
that
consensus
and
denied
the
request.
a
few
weeks
later,
but
still
during
the
trial,
formal
applications
were
filed
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
to
obtain
copies
of
the
tapes.
those
applications
were
assigned
to
judge
gesell
of
the
district
court
and
were
opposed
by
mr.
nixon.
the
clerk
of
the
court
filed
an
affidavit
at
the
request
of
judge
gesell
which
discussed
the
feasibility
of
reproducing
the
tapes
that
were
played
to
the
jury.
the
clerk
noted
that
portions
of
the
tapes
even
of
the
court
copy
of
the
tapes
still
remained
confidential,
that
not
all
of
the
copy
in
the
custody
of
the
court
had
been
played
to
the
jury.
he
concluded
though
that
with
sufficient
technical
assistance
and
sufficient
time,
it
would
possible
to
reproduce
a
set
of
the
tapes
played
to
the
jury
that
would
be
suitable
for
dissemination
to
the
applicants.
on
december
5,
judge
gesell
entered
a
memorandum
opinion
and
order
in
the
matter.
he
rejected
the
constitutional
claims
of
the
applicants
based
on
the
first
amendment,
but
he
did
find
that
there
was
a
practice
which
he
felt
was
supported
by
cases
of
common
law
and
by
the
manual
for
district
court
clerks
which
supported
the
claim
of
the
respondents
of
a
right
to
copy
the
tapes.
he
rejected
mr.
nixon’s
position
that
the
tape
should
not
be
provided
for
broadcast
under
any
circumstances.
but
he
reserved
decision
on
the
application,
pending
the
submission
of
a
plan
which
he
felt
should
number
one,
show
that
it
would
not
impose
an
undue
burden
on
the
clerk
to
make
and
disseminate
the
copies
and
number
two
it
would
guarantee
that
there
would
be
no
in
his
words,
over
commercialization
of
the
evidence.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
during
all
of
the
proceedings
that
i
have
described
so
far,
the
trial
was
still
going
on
and
judge
gesell’s
december
5th
opinion
was
entered
before
the
trial
was
completed.
the
plan
however
of
the
respondents
for
dissemination
of
the
tapes
was
submitted
in
late
december
and
by
january
8
when
judge
gesell
ruled
on
the
applications,
the
trial
was
concluded.
judge
gesell
denied
the
applications
without
prejudice.
he
stated
and
again
i
use
his
words
that
it
was
a
prerequisite
of
any
plan
that
commercialization
of
the
tapes
or
any
undignified
use
be
minimized.
he
felt
that
no
basis
for
distribution
of
the
tapes
that
met
this
goal
or
that
took
the
burden
off
the
shoulders
of
the
clerk
had
been
submitted.
after
judge
gesell’s
decision,
the
applications
were
transferred
back
to
judge
sirica
who
by
this
time
was
free
of
his
trial
duties.
after
a
hearing
and
obtaining
further
submissions
form
the
parties,
judge
sirica
entered
an
order
which
also
denied
the
applications
without
prejudice.
judge
sirica
like
judge
gesell
noted
that
in
his
opinion,
there
were
many
obstacles
that
must
be
overcome
before
any
release
of
the
tapes
might
be
made.
but
the
sole
issue
considered
by
him
at
that
time
was
the
question
of
timing
of
any
such
release.
judge
sirica
felt
the
special
qualities
of
the
tapes
and
the
uses
that
undoubtedly
would
be
made
of
them
should
they
be
released,
warranted
withholding
any
dissemination
of
copies
or
any
decision
on
whether
to
disseminate
copies
until
the
appeals
court
decided
whether
retrial
could
be
necessary
in
the
watergate
case.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided,
the
convictions
in
the
watergate
case
except
for
that
of
mr.
mardian
had
been
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
decided
to
rule
on
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case,
that
is
whether
the
tapes
ought
to
be
provided
for
broadcast
and
sale
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
your
honor
if
i
understand
your
question,
what
i
meant
by
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case,
was
whether
the
tapes,
given
present
circumstances,
ought
to
be
disseminated
to
the
press
and
to
members
of
the
public.
nothing
has
happened
since
that
time
to
change
at
least
what
the
court
of
appeals
stated
to
be
the
basis
for
its
conclusion.
now
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
there
was
a
common
law
right
of
access
to
judicial
records
that
encompassed
the
right
to
obtain
copies
of
these
tapes.
it
held
that
the
burden
was
in
mr.
nixon
to
establish
that
justice
required
making
an
exception
to
that
common
law
principle
and
third,
it
concluded
that
no
such
showing
had
been
made.
the
court
said
that
judge
sirica
had
abused
his
discretion
and
withholding
any
decision
on
release
of
the
tapes
until
the
watergate
appeals
were
decided
and
paradoxically
because
judge
gesell
had
actually
denied
the
applications,
the
court
characterized
his
decision
as
one
in
essence
affirming
his
exercise
of
discretion.
if
the
court
please,
preliminary,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
a
theme
that
runs
throughout
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
arguments
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
it
said
that
the
tapes
are
items
of
extreme
historical
importance.
it
said
that
there
is
an
enormous
public
desire
to
hear
them.
it
said
the
broadcast
and
providing
these
tapes
to
the
public
will
make
the
public
better
acquainted
with
our
content
and
the
public
is
and
can
be
now
having
access
only
to
the
transcripts.
we
do
not
take
issue
with
those
three
propositions,
but
we
do
say
that
they
are
not
properly
addressed
to
a
court.
the
court
has
no
authority,
no
power
generally
to
decide
what
property,
whether
in
the
custody
of
the
government
or
anyone
else
ought
to
be
broadcast
and
these
tapes
are
in
the
court’s
custody
solely
by
virtue
of
subpoena
and
solely
for
use
as
evidence
in
the
watergate
trial.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor,
the
court
has
control
of
the
exhibits
and
has
authority
to
do
with
them
anything
that
is
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
in
the
court’s
custody.
it
is
our
position
that
the
relief
that
is
sought
here,
the
effect
of
releasing
them
for
broadcast
is
not
to
serve
those
purposes
and
at
the
interests
that
are
retained
and
material
that
is
under
subpoena
should
preclude
the
court
from
making
that
sort
of
use
of
the
materials.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
i
do
not
at
all
your
honor.
number
one,
you
would
have
the
case
of
for
example
wiretap
conversations.
the
person
whose
voice
is
wiretapped
or
is
recorded
in
the
course
of
a
wiretap
does
not
own
the
tape
on
which
that
recording
is
made,
but
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
considerations
that
we
are
arguing
here
this
morning
would
apply
to
that
and
that
the
court
should
not
make
public
broadcast
and
public
release
of
that
tape
recording.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
it
is
your
honor
for
this
reason.
the
court
has
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
provide
tapes
of
its
own
proceedings
or
tapes
that
it
obtained
from
private
parties
to
the
public
or
to
the
broadcasters
with
knowledge
of
the
uses
that
are
going
to
be
made
of
them.
this
court’s
decisions
and
one
thing
we
do
recognize
is
that
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
first
amendment
would
seriously
limit
any
use,
any
suit
by
mr.
nixon,
any
suit
by
any
other
party
to
prevent
broadcasters
from
using
the
items
that
come
into
their
custody
that
are
released
by
the
court
in
any
matter
they
might
see
it
fit.
so
the
only
point
at
which
the
uses
can
be
controlled
is
the
point
at
which
it
is
decided
whether
to
put
them
in
the
hands
of
the
broadcasters,
whether
to
put
them
in
the
hands
of
the
record
companies.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
your
honor
as
i
said,
number
one,
our
claims
do
not
rest
on
a
constitutional
right
of
not
to
have
the
tape
disseminated,
but
as
for
the
subsequent
uses
that
might
be
made,
whether
we
have
a
right
of
privacy
or
a
right
of
copyright
or
some
cause
of
action
in
a
federal
court
or
in
a
state
court
to
prevent
those
uses
is
an
entirely
separate
question
from
whether
the
court
having
obtained
property
from
an
individual
for
limited
uses
might
provide
that
to
other
people
knowing
that
those
other
people,
members
of
the
public
are
going
to
make
uses
that
are
going
to
be
offensive
to
the
person
from
whom
the
property
was
obtained.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
certainly
for
the
court
and
we
do
not
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
court
to
provide
a
copy
to
a
person
who
agrees
and
signs
an
agreement
that
he
would
really
use
them
to
listen,
for
research.
that
he
would
not
disseminate
them
to
other
people.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
certainly
not
as
much.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
call
it
a
composite.
what
happened
was
judge
sirica
received
the
underlying
tapes
and
excluded
those
things
that
were
not
relevant
and
were
not
admissible
and
produced
what
we
call
a
court
copy
of
the
tapes.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
copies
are
nothing
but
the
underlying
tapes
and
the
only
thing
that
the
respondents
have
claimed
in
this
case,
they
do
not
really
claim
a
right
to
a
copy
of
the
entirety
of
the
court
copy,
the
trial
copy
of
the
tapes.
as
i
have
said,
that
trial
copy
contains
many
conversations
that
are
still
confidential.
so
there
is
nothing,
actually,
the
item
that
the
respondents
claim
a
right
to
copy
does
not
now
exist.
they
ask
that
that
item
i.e.
the
tapes
of
all
the
conversations
that
were
played
to
the
jury
be
produced.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
the
extracts,
that
is
correct.
it
is
about
22
hours
conversation.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
copies
could
have
well
been
made
from
those
tapes
as
from
the
court
copies,
but
the
plan
is
to
make
the
copies
for
dissemination.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
that
are
contained
in
the
court
copy
of
the
tapes.
you
understand
that
no
separate
recording
was
made
of
those
22
hours.
the
machine
was
there,
the
special
prosecutor
turned
it
to
the
place
he
wanted
and
played
it
during
the
trial.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
that
is
correct.
even
the
process
of
reproducing
these
tapes
required
in
the
district
court
of
approximately
a
three-page
order.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
the
respondents
do
not
claim
a
right
to
them,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
we
submit
that
their
argument
would
seem
to
establish
that
they
would.
they,
however,
appear
to
concede
that
those
conversations
are
confidential.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
but
if
the
court
recalls,
the
court
did
not
rule
on
the
actual
titles
of
the
tapes,
but
as
the
court
will
also
recall,
mr.
nixon
had
claimed
a
title
to
those
tapes.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
we
still
do.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no,
issue
in
the
case
depends
on
whether
he
has
title
to
the
recordings
or
not.
as
i
have
said
before,
if
these
were
wiretap
recordings,
the
same
issues
would
be
present
or
if
they
were
subpoenaed
from
my
custody
and
they
might
belong
to
my
brother-in-law
or
whatever,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
control
any
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
the
president
and
his
closest
aides
would
summarize
it
generally.
the
conversations
primarily
concerned
mr.
nixon
and
certain
members
of
the
cabinet
and
certain
members
of
the
white
house
staff.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
there
are
parties
who
were
recorded
on
the
original
recordings
that
are
in
judge
sirica’s
custody.
if
i
recall
correctly,
there
are
not
any
portions
that
were
actually
played
to
the
jury
that
involved
such
persons.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
court
does
impose
certain
restrictions
on
release
of
the
oral
arguments
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
the
recordings
we
are
talking
about
are
not
the
property
of
the
court.
they
were
obtained
by
judicial
process
for
a
limited
purpose
from
mr.
nixon.
there
are
reasons
we
would
submit
why
courts
do
not
and
should
not
allow
the
broadcast
of
recordings
made
of
judicial
proceedings,
but
at
the
least,
those
recordings
are
the
court’s
recordings.
they
are
recordings
that
the
court
has
the
absolute
power
to
do
with
as
they
please.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
common
law
right
involved
a
right
to
copy
tape
recordings
in
the
custody
of
the
clerk
is
inconsistent
with
the
uniform
recognition
by
the
courts
up
to
this
time
that
a
tape
is
different
from
a
transcript
and
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
but
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
contend
that,
but
if
the
court
please,
where
you
have
wiretapped
conversations,
where
you
have
privately
recorded
conversations
that
are
obtained
by
judicial
process,
you
have
a
different
kind
of
animal
than
you
have
in
a
recording
that
a
person
makes
with
expectation
that
it
is
being
made
in
public
discourse
with
an
expectation
that
it
is
even
being
made
over
television.
it
is
not
unusual
for
participants
in
private
conversations
to
speak
irreverently.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
but
we
have
said
your
honor
and
contend
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it
means
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
it
is
no
longer
private.
the
only
thing
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
we
do
not
argue
that
there
is
an
interest
in
confidentiality
per
se
that
still
maintained
as
to
these
things.
we
do
argue
that
there
is
a
legitimate
interest,
an
interest
of
the
court
may
respect
and
an
interest
of
the
court
should
respect
in
a
person
whose
private
conversations
are
recorded
and
which
contains
the
same
sort
of
language,
the
same
sort
of
discourse
that
would
be
expected
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
it
has
been
heard
by
certain
members
of
the
public.
it
has
not
been
released
to
every
disc
jockey,
every
entertainer
for
the
television
networks
to
be
played
on
television,
to
be
relentlessly
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
played
in
a
setting
that
is
its
very
purpose,
the
very
purpose
for
which
the
tape
will
be
produced.
it
would
be
played
to
do
justice
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
the
tape
recordings
were
ordered
and
produced.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
they
want
to
have
it
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
they
want
it
to
have
it
in
form
where
it
can
be
played
in
any
manner
that
they
think
appropriate.
broadcasting
television
that
is
the
purpose
of
some
of
the
respondents,
others
of
the
respondents
say
they
would
like
to
provide
it
for
home
use,
for
library
use
for
scholarly
purposes,
but
the
fact
is
that
once
released,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
it
is
not
your
honor
been
released
in
the
sense
that
copies
had
been
provided
for
these
uses.
now
we
submit
that
in
these
private
conversations
that
are
recorded
whether
wire
tap
or
otherwise,
it
is
one
thing.
it
is
going
to
be
embarrassing
to
the
participants.
it
is
going
to
cause
them
pain
for
those
conversations
to
be
disclosed,
for
those
conversations
to
be
printed
in
transcripts
and
disseminated.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
we
would
and
interestingly
enough
where
the,
at
least
the
kind
of
judicial
ethics
permits
the
televising
court
proceedings,
it
requires
a
consent
of
the
witnesses
and
of
the
parties
and
of
the
counsel,
which
is
essentially
a
waiver,
a
decision
that,
that
sort
of
intrusion
of
their
privacy
ought
to
be
made.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
it
has.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
estes
case
will
be
the
closest,
but
that
was
a
matter
of
due
process
to
the
defendant.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
i
would
like
to
make
two
responses
to
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
first
i
do
not
think
you
interpret
my
argument
correctly
when
you
assume
that
it
is
a
matter
involving
the
balancing
of
particular
privacy
interest
in
a
particular
case
against
whatever
needs
the
public
asserts
for
the
materials
where
an
subpoenaed
exhibit
that
is
not
the
property
of
the
court
comes
in
to
the
custody
of
the
court,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
not
as
a
policy
matter
make
those
available
beyond
the
issues
for
which
they
were
subpoenaed.
none
of
the
authorities
recognized
that
the
court
has
any
such
power,
not
the
manual
for
district
court
clerks,
not
any
of
the
common
law
cases.
the
second
response
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
that
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
in
this
particular
case
no
district
judge
has
exercised
this
discretion
even
if
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
to
make
release
of
the
recordings.
now,
as
to
exhibits,
if
an
exhibit
is
obtained,
the
question
raises
is
there
a
distinction
between
documentaries
and
take
the
exhibits
that
come
into
the
custody
of
the
court
under
a
subpoena.
even
if
the
documentary
exhibits
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
judge
gesell
found
a
practice
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
exhibits
were
routinely
made
available
for
copying,
subject
to
contrary
directions
by
the
trial
judge.
as
far
as
we
are
aware
no
instance
could
ever
have
risen
where
there,
number
one
anyone
had
actually
copied
the
tape
recorded
exhibit
or
number
two
anyone
had
copied
any
exhibit
obtained
from
a
private
party
over
his
next
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
we
submit
that
there
are
reasons
for
a
distinction,
but
we
do
contend
that
there
should
be
a
general
rule
for
all
exhibits.
if
a
party
for
example
under
subpoena
produces
a
photograph
and
there
are
reasons
why
that
person
who
has
the
entire
power
to
control
what
is
done
with
that
photograph
except
for
the
subpoena,
there
are
reasons
to
respect
that
person's
wishes
if
he
should
make
a
request
that
that
document
not
be
provided
for
showing
on
television
or
in
newspapers.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
sealing
the
record
is
the
exception,
but
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
the
party
could
make
a
request
for
sealing
of
the
record,
but
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
they
do
not
your
honor.
they
do
not
in
most
jurisdictions.
there
are
three
rules
in
fact,
actual
rules
of
district
court
that
prohibit
that
except
to
the
party’s
to
the
case.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
to
say
that
the
injury
that
is
involved
here
is
one
of
the
embarrassment,
or
one
of
mental
anguish,
does
not
it
seems
to
me
demean
the
importance
of
the
injury
that
will
be
suffered.
we
have
plenty
of
instances
in
the
law
where
precisely
such
an
injury
is
protected
against.
certainly
in
the
law
of
privacy,
certainly
in
the
statutes
in
some
states
and
court
rules
that
provide
for
sealing
the
record
in
juvenile
proceedings.
that
is
what
is
involved
in
those
cases,
preventing
call
it
embarrassment,
call
it
mental
anguish,
but
the
second
thing
is
that
we
need
to
recognize
that
tapes
are
different
from
transcripts.
the
transcripts
of
course
have
already
been
disclosed.
but
tapes
are
susceptible
to
uses
that
are
far
more
offensive
to
the
people
whose
voices
are
captured
on
the
tapes
than
are
transcripts
and
as
we
have
tried
to
point
out,
the
court,
it
is
one
thing
to
produce
the
tapes
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
for
use
in
a
criminal
trial,
but
the
effect
of
holding
that
there
is
a
common
law
right
of
the
public
to
obtain
copies
of
those
items
that
are
submitted
pursuant
to
subpoena
is
in
essence
to
say
that
the
effect
of
a
subpoena
is
not
just
to
require
production
to
the
court
and
the
parties,
but
the
effect
of
a
subpoena
is
to
require
production.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
that
is
a
necessary
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
felt
that
that
was
an
incident
of
a
public
trial
that
ought
to
be
done.
the
trial
is
over.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
order
in
which
he
said
that
there
was
a
constitutional
or
other
reason
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
yes,
he
did
and
he
provided
--
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
he
did
not
rule
at
that
time
that
while
the
tapes
were
going
to
be
played
in
the
courtroom
and
the
trial
was
going
to
be
conducted
as
publicly
as
a
trial
can
possibly
be,
that
once
that
trial
was
over,
there
was
any
right
of
the
public,
any
interest
in
the
public
in
obtaining
copies
of
those
tapes
to
do
with
them
whatever
the
public
pleased.
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
as
for
the
manual
for
district
court
clerks.
it
has
been
our
position
and
we
think
this
is
supported
by
the
common
law
cases,
the
cases
that
established
the
common
law
right,
that
the
common
law
right
is
applicable
to
materials
that
are
the
property
of
the
court.
it
said
that
the
manual
for
district
court
clerks
provides
that
in
cases
of
great
historical
importance,
that
exhibits
are
to
be
retained
by
the
clerk
or
to
become
a
part
of
the
clerk’s
permanent
records,
but
the
quotation
that
is
relied
on
by
judge
gesell
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents
is
not
the
correct
provision
of
the
manual
for
district
court
clerks.
the
manual
in
fact
recognizes
that
the
clerk
should
not
dispose
of
documentary
exhibits
not
physically
filed
with
a
case
that
is
in
the
court
jacket
and
not
claimed
by
parties
to
the
case,
that
is
item
number
10
in
chapter
13.
in
the
comment
to
that,
it
says
that
case
exhibits
impounded
by
the
court
or
voluntarily
submitted
as
evidence
normally
remain
the
property
of
parties
to
the
case.
so
the
manual
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
these
are
part
of
the
traditional
court
records
that
are
subject
to
the
common
law
right
of
inspection.
as
we
have
said,
there
is
nothing
in
the
purpose
of
a
subpoena.
there
is
nothing
in
the
function
of
a
court
that
justifies
the
court
in
so
treating
them.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
i
believe
the
claim
does
affect
any
property
right
that
he
might
assert,
but
as
i
have
tried
to
say,
there
is
no
question
here
of
title
to
the
tapes.
no
argument
that
we
make
depends
on
the
title.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
one
thing
is
clear,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no
i
am
not
distinguishing
between
property
and
title,
but
i
am
saying
that
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
the
tapes
are
not
the
property
of
the
court.
the
tapes
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court
for
a
limited
purpose.
now,
whether
it
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
through
gsa
or
congress
that
should
decide
whether
to
make
these
public
or
whether
it
is
mr.
nixon
himself
that
should
decide
whether
to
make
these
public,
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
not
the
court
which
has
the
tapes
only
for
a
limited
purpose
and
there
is
not
common
law
principle
which
would
apply
regardless
of
ownership
and
say
that
these
sort
of
exhibits
must
be
supplied
to
the
broadcasters
and
record
companies.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
know
whether
the
underlying
original
recordings
have
been
delivered.
the
court
copies
certainly
have
not.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
think
that
the
court
could
not
grant
effective
relief
if
gsa
were
not
a
necessary
party,
but
as
the
court
is
aware
and
as
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
the
gsa
originally
took
the
position
that
no
tapes
subject
to
that
act
would
be
copied
and
provided
to
the
media
and
the
public.
that
has
gone
back
and
forth
between
gsa
and
congress
in
the
course
of
changing
and
resubmitting
regulations
and
the
current
regulations
though
still
not
final,
appear
to
or
may
at
least
leave
that
decision
dependent
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
jeffress,
jr.
odd
as
that
may
seem,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
appears
to
be
what
is
in
the
latest
proposed
regulations
submitted
by
gsa
to
congress.
it
is
provided
that
the
distribution
or
dissemination
of
the
tapes
will
depend
on
the
whatever
the
ultimate
relief
granted
in
this
case.
