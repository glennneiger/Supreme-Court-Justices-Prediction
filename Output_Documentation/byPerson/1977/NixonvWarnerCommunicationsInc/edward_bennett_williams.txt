mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
if
i
spent
just
a
couple
of
minutes
if
the
court
please,
identifying
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
non
issues
in
this
case
which
have
been
raised
as
questions
in
the
courts
below
in
the
tortuous
journey
of
this
case
over
three
years
to
this
courtroom.
first
of
all,
the
peg
to
which
judge
sirica
latched
his
memorandum
and
order
is
now
moot.
there
are
no
more
prospective
defendants,
no
more
prospective
trials,
and
therefore,
no
more
prospective
prejudice.
secondly,
we
are
not
here
contending
that
in
every
single
instance,
there
is
a
right
to
inspect
and
copy
and
distribute
every
exhibit
that
goes
into
a
courtroom
in
the
trial
of
a
case.
we
recognize
that
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
there
may
be
instances
where
he
will
deny
that
right
where
there
are
property
rights
involved,
where
there
are
illegal
wiretaps
which
are
offered
in
evidence,
where
in
a
wiretapping
criminal
case,
for
example
or
where
there
is
a
contraband
offered
as
part
of
the
prosecution's
case
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
there
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
here
for
the
trial
judge,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
are
not
here
assailing
the
traditional
rules
of
court
which
preclude
access
and
distribution
of
the
tape
recordings
of
trials
or
indeed
of
appellate
arguments.
we
are
not
here
making
that
assault.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
think
your
honor
that
embarrassment
per
se
would
be
a
legitimate
reason
for
denial
of
access.
indeed
i
think
that
is
what
petitioner’s
position
is
reduced
to.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
there
were
a
proprietary
right
and
if
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
think
embarrassment
per
se
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
i
say
this
with
no
meanness
of
spirit,
but
i
think
that
is
what
petitioner’s
argument
is
reduced
to.
it
is
that
an
alleged
conspirator
has
the
right
not
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
sound
of
his
inculpatory
words
solely
because
he
was
president
when
they
were
uttered.
i
think
that
is
the
reduction
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
our
position
is
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
not
engaging
in
any
debate
about
title.
we
are
saying
that
while
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
we
have
the
right
to
inspect
and
copy
and
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court
and
i
think
had
they
been
returned,
we
would
be
on
a
different
footing.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
have
not
been
returned
your
honor
because
i
understand
that
the
manual
for
the
clerks
of
court
which
has
been
promulgated
out
of
a
judicial
conference
mandates
that
records
of
this
kind,
be
kept
for
a
period
of
10
years.
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
they
have
not
been
returned
and
our
position
is
quite
narrow.
it
is
that
while
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
we
have
a
time
honored
traditional
common
law
right
to
inspect
those
documents
and
to
copy
them
and
make
such
distribution.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
a
common
law
right
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
has
been
recognized
for
100
years.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
he
has
not,
your
honor
and
fortunately
the
person’s
whose
voices
were
heard
on
the
tapes
were
all
parties
defendant
in
the
case
below,
captioned
us
v.
mitchell
et.
al.
in
which
petition
for
certiorari
was
denied
in
this
court
last
spring.
there
are
exceptions
to
that.
there
are
two
advisers
to
the
president
who
are
not
parties
defendant
to
that
case
whose
names
appear
in
those
tapes
and
whose
voices
are
heard
on
those
tapes.
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
register
objection
or
claim
embarrassment.
i
suggest
if
that
is
a
concern
that
can
easily
be
handled
at
the
time
that
the
method
for
distribution
is
promulgated
in
the
federal
register.
they
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
assert
what
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
a
few
moments
ago,
their
right
not
to
be
embarrassed
or
their
right
if
they
will
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
is
an
insufficient.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
are
a
lot
of
rights
which
are
asserted
with
an
insufficient
basis
such
as
petitioner’s
right
in
this
very
court
in
my
opinion.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
extrajudicial
statements,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
so
your
honor
for
these
reasons.
just
as
the
written
transcript
of
the
trial
would
be
available
for
publication
by
newspapers,
periodicals
and
publishers
if
they
chose
to
use
the
transcript
and
we
are
familiar
with
many
instances
where
transcripts
have
been
used
as
basis
for
books.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
see
a
difference,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
a
fortiori
the
argument
obtains
that
they
should
be
released
if
they
are
oral
as
distinguished
from
visual
exhibits
for
these
reasons.
if
you
look
at
the
written
transcripts
of
the
exhibits
which
are
in
question
here,
you
will
see
that
they
are
laced
with
the
expression
“uh-uh.”
now,
uh-uh
can
be
aha
or
it
can
be
uh-uh
or
it
can
be
uhu
and
each
of
those
has
a
separate
and
distinct
meaning
and
i
think
when
representations
are
being
made
with
respect
to
oral
conversations
held,
extrajudicially,
the
very
best
representation
of
those
oral
conversations
is
not
in
a
written
document,
but
in
an
oral
transcript.
so
i
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
argument
is
a
fortiori
when
we
are
dealing
with
conversations.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
they
would
have
no
more
basis
for
stopping
the
broadcasting
your
honor
than
for
stopping
the
publication.
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
news
stories
that
have
been
written
in
the
recent
years
about
judges
remonstrating
with
juries
for
their
verdicts.
i
say
once
again
your
honor
that
the
same
rights
should
obtain
with
respect
to
reproduction
of
that
orally.
of
course,
we
have
as
you
know
mr.
chief
justice
rules
throughout
our
federal
system
which
foreclose
the
right
of
access
to
the
tape
recordings
of
the
trial
proceedings
in
all
of
our
courts
and
that
applies
also
to
our
appellate
courts.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
we
have
all
had
that
experience
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
a
proceeding.
it
may
be
an
unfortunate
part
of
the
proceeding.
it
becomes
part
of
the
court
record.
it
is
in
the
written
transcript,
and
therefore,
in
the
public
domain
and
i
suggest
also
absent
the
rule
which
forecloses
access
to
the
oral
transcript
of
a
trial
proceeding
that
there
should
be
a
right
also
to
broadcast
such
a
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
is
a
good
and
salutary
rule
at
the
trial
court
level,
mr.
justice
white
because
i
think
the
search
for
truth
is
difficult
enough.
look
at
the
fragility
of
human
powers
of
perception,
the
fragility
of
their
powers
of
recollection,
the
fragility
of
their
powers
of
expression
and
then
introduce
their
veracity,
it
is
difficult
enough
without
putting
them
on
stage
and
having
them
conscious
to
the
fact
that
every
word
that
they
utter
in
the
courtroom
is
being
recorded.
i
think
that
would
be
an
inhibiting
factor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
is
such
a
rule
existing
now
mr.
chief
justice
so
you
would
not
have
to
make
that
argument,
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
i
think
that
if
there
were
not
such
a
rule
and
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
be
recorded,
i
think
he
would
lose
that.
just
as
if
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
have
my
words
taken
down
on
the
transcript.
i
think
he
would
lose
that
because
i
think
the
court
would
say,
quite
properly,
that
we
want
to
have
a
check
on
the
accuracy
of
the
court
reporter,
but
we
need
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
is
what
i
think
the
court
would
say
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
i
were
counsel
for
mr.
nixon,
would
i
--?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
accept
that
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
have
answered
that
i
think.
i
have
answered
that
because
i
believe
there
is
a
different
rule
that
obtains
at
the
trial
level
than
from
that
which
obtains
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
at
the
appellate
level,
my
understanding
is
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
we
many
not
have
access
to
the
oral
arguments
of
this
court
or
any
circuit
court
across
the
land.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
salutary
rule.
i
think
it
is
the
wrong
rule
sir,
but
i
am
realistic
enough
to
recognize
that
if
i
made
that
contention
and
lost,
i
would
have
nowhere
to
go.[laughter]
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
you
could
certainly
do
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
argue
if
i
were
put
into
that
position,
which
i
am
not
fortunately
today
as
i
said
at
the
outset
of
this
argument,
i
am
not
here
assailing
that
rule
or
any
rule
covering
that
subject,
but
i
certainly
would
argue
that
the
transcript
of
my
argument
here
today
is
a
public
record
of
a
judicial
proceeding
and
that
the
public
should
have
access
to
my
oral
argument
and
if
they
have
access
to
it,
there
is
a
concomitant
right
to
copy
and
the
concomitant
right
to
copy
gets
constitutional
dignity
in
my
view.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thank
you
very
much
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
court’s
discretion,
it
might
refuse
access
to
those
if
they
were
pornographic
in
nature
and
i
curb
that
out
as
an
exception.
i
think
there
are
certain
things
where
there
are
rights
of
privacy,
where
there
are
rights
of
privilege
for
example,
mr.
justice
white
talked
about
the
tapes
that
were
not
offered
in
evidence,
they
were
privileged
so
we
cannot
claim
those.
they
are
presumptively
privileged
under
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
1974.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
not
say
there
was
a
privilege,
mr.
justice
powell.
if
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
believed
that
the
testimony
which
had
been
taken
in
court
constituted
pornographic
material,
i
think
it
might
exercise
its
discretion
to
foreclose.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
there
are
other
situations
where
it
could
exercise
its
discretion,
mr.
justice
powell
to
foreclose
the
right
of
distributing
broadcast
material.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
in
cases,
to
delineate
them
specifically,
i
would
think
in
cases
where
the
prosecution
offered
illegally
obtained
wiretapped
material
to
prove
a
case
against
a
wiretap
where
it
offered
hardcore
pornographic
material
to
prove
that
the
defendant
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
admitted
in
evidence
and
from
the
question
that
he
propounded,
i
assumed
he
was
talking
about
materials
that
were
pornographic
in
nature.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
a
public
trial
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
that
instance,
the
trial
judge
should
exercise
his
discretion
to
not
inhibit
access
to
it
because
it
is
in
a
public
trial.
it
would
have
been
printed
unless
he
excluded
the
press.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
said
he
could
print
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
they
can
print
it.
if
i
were
the
trial
judge,
i
would
not
put
that
inhibiting
rule
regardless
of
the
embarrassment
that
flowed,
but
it
is
a
consideration
that
the
trial
judge
might
take
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
and
all
that
we
are
saying
here
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
these
are
not
laced
with
expletives
and
we
contend
that
there
is
a
right
to
inspect
and
copy
them.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
get
constitutionally
in
to
what
use
is
made
of
those
records
once
they
are
released
because
we
run
into
countervailing
first
amendment
considerations
and
we
are
now
dealing
in
a
question
of
taste
rather
than
law.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
a
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
access,
copying
and
distribution
and
whoever
distributes
has
to
take
the
full
risk
of
distribution
and
whatever
actions
may
be
brought
by
any
aggrieved
parties.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
should
not
be.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
it
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
material
which
are
part
of
very
--
when
i
use
the
term
hardcore
pornography,
i
am
using
really
a
description
of
material
which
is
contraband,
namely
the
very
possession
of
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
i
think
whatever
embarrassment
there
may
have
been
has
already
taken
place
in
the
public
trial
and
by
the
publication
of
the
materials.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
so.
i
think
that
embarrassment
per
se
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
denial
of
a
common
law
right
and
the
concomitant
constitutional
right
that
flows
from
inspection.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
a
difference
between
extrajudicial
recordings
that
are
offered
as
exhibits
in
a
trial
and
the
transcript
of
the
judicial
proceedings
per
se
and
i
have
said
that
we
are
not
again
saying
the
rule
which
inhibits
the
transcription
of
judicial
proceedings
because
there
are
countervailing
considerations,
the
inhibitions
that
witnesses
feel
when
they
are
taking
for
oral
recordings.
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
but
we
are
dealing
solely
here
mr.
chief
justice
with
extrajudicial
recordings
that
were
made
exhibits
in
the
court
below
that
were
played
to
the
jury,
that
were
played
to
all
of
the
persons
who
were
in
the
courtroom
that
were
visually
transcribed,
reproduced,
sold
as
books,
sold
in
the
form
of
periodicals
and
magazine
pieces
across
the
world,
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
offered
before
the
jury
and
since
(voice
overlap)
as
described
by
your
honor
presumably
it
is
offered
to
a
packed
courtroom
and
presumably
it
is
published
by
the
press
and
by
the
periodicals
covering
the
trial
so
that
at
the
moment
that
the
recording
is
played,
it
is
in
the
public
domain.
the
facts
are
in
the
public
domain
and
it
is
now
out
as
it
were.
now,
we
have
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
member
of
the
public
can
get
access
to
the
exhibit
in
the
form
of
an
oral
transcript
then
we
contend
yes,
that
there
is
a
right,
a
common
law
right
to
get
access
and
then
a
concomitant
constitutional
right
to
reproduce
after
getting
access
to
that
record
and
i
think
the
court
cannot
concern
itself
at
that
time
with
what
use
is
made,
what
the
user
would
have
to
take
his
risks
there
and
after,
whatever
they
may
be
for
actions
that
might
be
brought
against
him
by
an
aggrieved
party
who
would
contend
that
he
has
a
right
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
a
right
not
to
be
embarrassed.
i
do
not
know
of
any
common
law
right
not
to
be
embarrassed
by
ones
own
inculpatory
words
and
i
think
that
finally
is
the
position
that
petitioner
is
urging
before
this
court
today.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
constrained
to
say
that
sounds
like
a
male
show
from
the
street
mark
that
he
is
not
guilty.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
thought
one
of
the
in
precepts
criminus
with
the
adultery
and
if
he
is,
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
then
i
guess
i
have
to
quarrel
mr.
chief
justice
with
your
premise
that
he
has
no
guilt
because
i
have
to
put
him
in
equal
guilt
with
the
defendant
wife
and
i
would
have
to
once
again
say
that
he
has
no
right
not
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
sound
of
his
inculpatory
words
if
that
is
what
was
transcribed.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
suppose
he
had
an
option
not
to
bring
the
case
on
those
grounds.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
a
little
late,
but
i
think
that
he
has
no
standing
having
brought
the
case
and
having
offered
the
evidence
in
a
public
trial
having
subpoenaed
the
transcript
of
the
inculpatory
words
evidencing
inculpatory
conduct,
now
to
claim
that
he
will
be
embarrassed
if
it
is
further
reproduced
after
it
has
been
offered
in
open
court
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
so
of
course.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
think
it
is.
i
think
embarrassment
is
really
not
the
point.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
it
would
mr.
justice
white.
