unknown
speaker
would
you
feel
otherwise
if
these
items
have
not
been
subpoenaed?
do
you
conceive
that
then
there
would
be
a
right
to
reproduce
the
tapes
as
tapes
as
distinguished
from
reproducing
their
contents?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
not
say
the
question
is
whether
the
court
can
make
them
avail
it
to
another
person
for
any
purpose?
because
if
you
go
on
and
say
for
obnoxious
purposes
then
the
court
really
is
going
to
have
to
distinguish
between
one
use
from
another?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
what
privacy
interest
that
you
assert
would
not
be
invaded
by
that
or
what
property
interests
would
be
invaded
by
that?
unknown
speaker
but
issue
though,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
the
estes
case
was
at
close
at
hand?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
printed
transcripts?
unknown
speaker
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
constitution
requires
this
court
to
maintain
that
taping
process
or
whatever?
unknown
speaker
so
we
could
do
away
with
it
and
not
violate
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
short
of
a
constitutional
argument,
what
are
your
arguing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
other
words,
it
is
pretty
much
in
the
trial
judgeâ€™s
discretion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
would
it
be
a
valid
reason
for
a
trial
judge
to
deny
the
right
to
copy
if
he
felt
that
the
material
would
be
embarrassing
to
a
witness
and
might
discourage
future
prospective
witnesses
from
wanting
to
come
forward
and
testify
in
trials?
unknown
speaker
how
about
photographs
of
someone
hurt
in
an
automobile
accident,
a
particularly
unattractive
photograph,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
a
permissible
reason
to
deny
on
the
ground
of
embarrassment
to
the
witness?
unknown
speaker
no
proprietary
right.
just
pure
embarrassment?
unknown
speaker
whatever
be
the
position?
