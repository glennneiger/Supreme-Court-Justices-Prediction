mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
by
trying
to
be
as
clear
as
i
can
about
precisely
what
the
tapes
are
that
are
involved
here
and
the
degree
to
which
they
have
already
come
into
the
public
domain.
some
of
these
tapes
are
subpoenaed
by
a
special
prosecutor
cox
in
1973
and
after
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
them
to
be
turned
over
by
mr.
nixon
and
after
mr.
cox’s
dismissal,
they
were
turned
over.
others
were
subpoenaed
by
special
prosecutor
jaworski
and
after
this
court’s
ruling
in
1974,
they
were
turned
over.
now,
with
respect
to
the
tapes
involved
here,
we
do
not
deal
with
any
other
than
those
introduced
as
exhibits
in
the
mitchell
trial.
all
were
heard
in
open
court
and
be
overheard
not
just
by
the
12
jurors,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
everyone
in
the
court
because
everyone
that
came
into
the
court
was
provided
with
earphones
so
that
they
could
be
heard
by
everyone.
the
computation
in
this
case
is
that
something
in
order
of
1,300
individuals
heard
some
or
all
of
the
tapes.
so
everyone
in
the
courtroom
heard
everything
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
and
all
of
the
tapes
had
been
printed.
as
mr.
nixon’s
brief
correctly
states
all
of
the
tapes.
the
transcripts
of
them
continue
to
be
available
around
the
country
for
public
reading
and
reflection.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir,
all
the
printed
transcripts
are
available.
what
has
been
missing
from
public
is
what
we
came
to
court
to
seek,
provided
the
public
not
present
in
court
to
hear
the
tapes
that
everyone
in
court
heard.
there
is
no
question
here
about
the
ability
to
reproduce
these
tapes
without
destroying
the
original
tape
from
which
they
were
made.
the
clerk
of
the
court
so
stated
in
his
affidavit
and
we
have
not
heard
anything
contrary
from
mr.
nixon
nor
is
there
any
issue
as
to
mr.
nixon
seeking
the
return
in
any
sense
of
these
tapes.
as
the
reply
brief
submitted
to
this
court
last
week
explicitly
disclaimed
any
effort
on
his
part
to
get
these
tapes
back
from
the
clerk,
page
17
of
his
reply
brief
and
the
league
of
issues
as
we
see
that
are
before
this
court
are
relatively
narrow,
but
before
i
reach
them,
i
would
like
to
be
very
clear
as
to
what
judge
gesell
held
in
his
opinion
or
which
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
stated
it
was
as
it
were
affirming.
judge
gesell’s
first
opinion
only
opinion
as
it
was
in
this
case
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
tape
exhibits
are
in
evidence,
i
am
quoting
now,
and
have
therefore
come
into
the
public
domain
and
the
public
should
have
the
chance
to
hear
them.
mr.
nixon’s
opposition
was
denied
by
judge
gesell.
judge
gesell
to
be
sure
required
us
to
formulate
a
plan
for
distribution
of
the
tapes
and
a
plan
which
would
avoid
certain
commercialization
and
the
like.
we
submitted
the
plan,
it
was
rejected
by
judge
gesell.
judge
sirica
then
held
a
hearing
and
refused
to
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
he
was
improperly
concerned
about
commercialization
after
the
initial
distribution
of
the
tapes.
i
think
he
was
quite
within
the
court's
providence
to
say
that
in
the
first
instance
when
the
tapes
were
to
be
reproduced,
that
is
to
say
a
master
tape
made
and
initially
distributed
to
the
public,
i
think
it
was
proper
at
least
we
take
no
quarrel
to
the
proposition,
but
after
that
he
can
properly
say
that
the
court
should
say
that
there
should
be
no
commercialization.
the
only
problem
that
we
have
in
judge
gesell’s
opinion
is
that
he
may
have
inferred,
we
do
not
think
he
did
in
his
first
opinion
and
mr.
nixon
said
we
did
not
think
he
did
in
his
first
opinion,
he
may
have
inferred
that
after
the
tapes
were
out
to
the
public
that
there
were
constitutional
limitations
which
could
be
placed
on
a
fuse.
in
so
far
as
judge
gesell
did
believe
that,
we
think
he
was
incorrect.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
had
no
problem
with
that
at
all
justice
rehnquist.
indeed
we
have
now
submitted
to
the
court
a
plan
which
would
take
everything
off
the
court’s
hands
under
which
the
national
archives
will
take
full
responsibility
for
the
making
of
the
tapes
and
the
distribution
of
the
tape
to
the
public
at
minimal
cost.
we
do
not
need
and
we
do
not
seek
any
aid
from
the
court
here
at
all,
save
the
ability
to
have
these
tapes
reproduced
by
the
national
archives
and
then
distributed
generally
to
the
public.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
are
not
involved
here
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
all
we
are
seeking
are
court
exhibits.
those
materials
which
judge
sirica
received
which
was
not
admitted
into
evidence,
we
have
made
no
claim
for
in
this
case,
they
have
never
been
made
available
generally
to
the
public,
they
were
not
heard
in
open
court.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
are
in
court,
but
they
are
not
public
records.
they
are
in
judge
sirica’s
vault
as
it
were
and
there
under
a
protective
order.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
the
question
of
whether
they
are
public
records
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
because
the
parts
we
seek
are
court
exhibits.
the
parts
we
seek
were
played
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
were
admitted
into
evidence.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
all
we
are
seeking
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
our
theory
goes
this
far.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
as
a
general
matter
materials
held
by
the
court
are
available
to
the
public,
as
a
general
matter
at
least
in
the
context
where
they
are
court
exhibits
and
admitted
into
evidence.
there
is
a
material
to
be
sure,
a
grand
jury
for
example,
we
are
told,
the
material
is
submitted
to
a
grand
jury
that
is
not
by
any
one
standard
public
information
and
we
do
not
seek
any
such
information.
we
do
not
take
the
position
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
that
we
are
entitled
to
everything
that
finds
its
way
to
court
in
some
fashion
or
another
and
we
accept
the
proposition
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
are
situations
in
which
things
even
when
introduced
in
evidence
may
not
be
made
publicly
available
for
one
reason
or
another.
of
course
if
it
is
introduced
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
it
is
contraband
for
example.
if
it
is
for
example
pornographic
literature,
if
it
is
subject
to
copyright
laws
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
is
a
case
law
which
we
believe
is
correctly
decided
at
the
lower
court
level
indicating
that
copyrighted
materials
introduced
in
evidence
may
not
be
reprinted
certainly
without
violating
the
copyright
law
as
to
whether
they
maybe
obtained
and
presumed
as
justice
rehnquist’s
question
earlier,
obtained
and
where
one
could
print
as
it
were
and
take
ones
chances
that
maybe.
we
would
not
even
object
to
a
rule
and
we
do
not
even
go
so
far
in
this
case
as
to
urge
a
rule
which
would
routinely
allow
anyone
to
walk
in
and
get
a
hold
of
the
copyrighted
material
in
that
sense.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely,
and
if
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
as
you
understand
it
is
a
delicate
question
for
me
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
certainly
think
that
there
is
a
vast
distinction
between
any
limitations
placed
by
courts
including
this
court
on
the
use
of
argument
or
trials
or
the
like
then
there
is
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
you
have
more
authority
in
my
view,
under
authority
such
as
the
estes
case
to
limit
the
public
dissemination
of
the
tape
of
this
argument
then
would
be
the
case
of
an
exhibit
filed
in
this
court,
which
i
would
urge
upon
you
is
more
generally
available.
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor
i
do
not
deny
for
the
moment
that
you
have
complete
authority
to
do
that.
in
giving
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
what
i
was
attempting
to
urge
was
that
it
would
give
me
a
lot
of
constitutional
qualms
if
you
were
to
limit
the
accessibility
to
court
exhibits
in
this
very
courthouse.
i
could
not
deny
that
you
could
do
it,
but
it
would
seem
to
be
inconsistent
with
many
years
of
american
practice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
and
if
other
courts
were
to
do
the
same
thing
i
would
make
the
same
argument
today.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
rehnquist,
i
cannot
be
put
into
position
of
disagreeing
that
the
constitutional
arguments
for
limiting
dissemination
of
the
arguments
here
are
very
weak.
i
think
that
there
is
a
strong
constitutional
case
to
be
made
for
having
a
public
disclosure
as
is
possible
of
this
very
proceeding.
i
take
it
the
reason
that
it
is
not
made
available
are
the
kinds
of
reason
that
regarded
to
estes
case,
the
possibility
of
inhibiting
counsel
affecting
the
dignity
of
the
court
proceedings.
our
position
is
you
can
inhibit
an
exhibit,
but
there
is
nothing
in
what
is
involved
in
this
case
which
is
analogous.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
housekeeping
matter
justice
rehnquist,
it
does
seem
to
us
to
have
long
standing
roots
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
as
a
general
matter
court
copies
maybe
made
of
things
held
in
court
subject
to
exception
and
subject
to
abuse,
but
that
as
a
general
proposition
court
records
are
available
to
be
inspected
by
the
public
and
copied
by
the
public.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
the
taping
of
this
proceeding
your
honor?
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
do
make
a
constitutional
argument
mr.
justice
white.
we
do
argue
that
in
pursuant
to
the
cox
broadcasting
case
or
at
least
pursuant
to
the
same
theory
of
the
cox
broadcasting
case
which
has
not
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
lot
more
--
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
am
sorry?
mr.
floyd
abrams
no
sir
it
did
not
and
i
do
not
need
to
suggest
that
it
did.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
if
cox
is
correctly
read
as
i
do
we
are
saying
that
the
advantage
to
the
public
and
the
wide
spread
dissemination
of
information
even
as
offensive
as
a
name
of
a
rape
victim
and
that
the
privacy
interest
in
the
father
of
a
rape
victim
can
be
overcome
and
must
be
overcome
because
the
information
is
contained
in
a
court
record.
but
by
parity
of
reasoning
in
this
case,
court
exhibits
introduced
in
evidence,
not
to
say
these
court
exhibits
introduced
in
evidence,
should
be
made
public.
mr.
floyd
abrams
short
of
a
constitutional
argument
we
argue
as
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
is
a
long
standing
common
law
practice
and
right
to
make
copies
of
court
documents
and
to
make
copies
of
court
exhibits
that
this
right
is
not
an
absolute
right,
that
it
has
exceptions
to
it
that
none
of
the
potential
exceptions
to
it
ought
to
be
applied
in
this
case
and
indeed
there
is
a
very
significant
argument
to
be
made
in
favor
of
release
of
these
tapes.
i
would
put
it
this
way,
justice
white.
we
think
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
adopted
an
opposite
test,
the
presumption
against
release
of
information
such
as
this
instead
of
one
placing
the
burden
on
mr.
nixon,
we
think
we
could
meet
that
test
in
this
case.
we
think
in
this
case,
there
is
such
a
public
interest
and
there
is
such
a
pubic
utility
in
having
these
tapes
made
available
that
even
if
the
presumption
were
against
us,
we
could
meet
it.
thank
you,
your
honors.
