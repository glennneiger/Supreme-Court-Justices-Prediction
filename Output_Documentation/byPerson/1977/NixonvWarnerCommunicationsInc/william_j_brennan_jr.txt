what
about
the
question
i
put
to
your
colleague,
this
court
may
impose
limitations
on
the
distributions
of
the
recording
of
you
argument
today,
eliminate
particular
purposes
and
particular
groups
and
deny
it
through
cbs
or
the
news
media
generally
if
we
want
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
which
way
was
it
cut,
we
can
or
cannot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
rule
at
the
appellate
level?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
williams
you
say
you
have
nowhere
to
go,
what
would
be
your
argument
that
we
could
not
put
limitations
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
the
recording
laced
with
expletives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
expletives
and
all?
