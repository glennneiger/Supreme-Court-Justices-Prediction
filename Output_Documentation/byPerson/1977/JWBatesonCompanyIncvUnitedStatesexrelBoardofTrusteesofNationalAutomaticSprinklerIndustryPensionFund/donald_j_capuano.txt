mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
stevens
before
i
get
into
my
argument.
you
have
asked
sir,
whether
the
state
mechanic's
lien
laws
covered
this
problem
and
you
did
not
see
any
discussion
of
it
in
the
brief.
it
is
our
view
that
when
congress
adopted
the
miller
act,
the
main
purpose
or
in
fact
as
chairman
miller
stated
in
the
legislative
history,
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
merely
to
correct
the
procedural
problems
in
the
heard
act,
so
they
were
not
adopting
the
miller
act
to
try
to
conform
it
with
state
mechanic's
lien
laws.
they
were
trying
to
correct
the
procedural
difficulties
in
the
heard
act,
those
difficulties
were
that
there
was
only
one
bond,
the
government
had
the
first
opportunity
to
sue,
contractors
had
to
wait
six
months
before
they
could
sue,
all
of
the
suites
had
to
be
joined
in
one
proceeding.
these
items,
or
difficulties
made
it
impossible
for
contractors
to
collect
their
money
on
government
jobs,
and
as
a
result
they
were
forced
to
settle
for
a
lot
less
than
what
their
claims
were
worth.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
miller
act
and
under
the
heard
act,
anybody
who
supplied
labor
or
material
to
the
job
was
entitled
to
go
against
the
bond.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
--
there
was
not
a
question
of
privity
involved
as
we
submit
the
petition
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
believe
that
you
are
correct
and
of
course
the
heard
act
covered
everybody
who
supplied
any
labor
or
material
on
the
job.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes
in
that
sense.
now,
i
do
recognize
that
in
the
miller
act,
a
limitation
was
imposed
with
regard
to
this
proviso
that
the
petitioner
is
relying
upon,
but
in
our
view,
the
miller
act
did
not
change
in
the
sense,
the
class
of
people
who
could
be
covered.
what
the
miller
act
did
was,
provide
an
opportunity
for
a
general
contract
or
a
prime
contractor
to
protect
himself
from
remote
claims.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
under
the
heard
act,
yes,
under
the
miller
act
no,
because
the
colquitt’s
employees
would
be
in
the
same
situation
they
are
in
this
case.
now,
the
trustees
who
brought
this
suit
are
trustees
of
a
jointly
administered
pension
welfare
entrepreneurship
fund.
in
other
words,
there
are
equal
number
of
employer
and
union
trustees
on
this
fund
or
actually
there
are
three
funds
involved,
the
money
that
they
were
trying
to
obtain
was
the
contribution
that
colquitt
in
its
collective-bargaining
agreement
promised
to
make
to
these
funds
every
month
on
behalf
of
the
employees
to
fund
their
pension
benefits,
health
and
insurance
benefits
and
educational
benefits.
in
addition,
the
union
is
a
respondent
in
this
case
and
was
a
plaintiff
because
colquitt
withheld
money
from
the
wages
of
the
employees,
part
of
which
was
to
go
towards
union
dues
and
the
other
deduction
was
to
go
to
a
vacation
savings
plan
set
up
individual
savings
accounts
in
banks
for
each
employee,
of
course,
the
employees
never
got
this
money.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
hear
was
look
at
the
facts
in
the
case,
for
example,
it
found
that
the
sprinkler
system
installed
by
colquitt
was
specifically
required
by
bateson’s
contract
with
the
government,
it
found
that
sprinkler
system
was
an
integral
and
significant
part
of
the
whole
building,
it
found
the
work
that
colquitt
did
was
performed
over
substantial
period
of
time
and
it
found
that
the
work
was
important
and
in
support
of
that
it
showed
or
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
work
done
by
colquitt’s
employees
was
taken
over
by
pierce
when
colquitt
went
broke
or
was
unable
to
perform
anymore.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
would
not
concede
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
no,
the
point
is
that
applying
this
court’s
test
in
rich
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
look
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
substantial
and
important
relationship
between
the
prime
and
this
other
party,
the
defaulting
party
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
the
point
is
you
do
not
look
at
privity
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
alright
it
says
to
the
ninth
degree.
you
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
substantially
important
relationship.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
he
is
a
subcontractor.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
under
the
prime
and
his
employees
or
any
person
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
are
covered,
now,
the
reason
that
this
court
in
our
view
adopted
this
substantial
and
important
test
was
because
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
and
the
court
is
repeated
it
many
times
here,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
the
interest
of
those
who
supply
labor
and
material
to
a
federal
project
or
a
public
project
so
that
they
can
get
their
money.
now,
certainly,
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
act,
the
only
reason
for
having
the
proviso
in
the
act,
is
to
protect
a
prime
contractor
from
some
claims
which
are
totally
remote,
something
he
could
not
protect
himself
against.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
do
not
have
any
problem
with
that
at
all
because
the
test
that
this
court
set
up
in
rich
and
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
really
no
different
than
test
that
the
court
has
set
up
in
other
situations
for
example,
reasonable
man.
i
do
not
believe
this
test
is
anymore
difficult
than
a
reasonable
man
test.
there
are
going
to
be
close
cases
under
this
definition,
but
we
submit
that
if
you
adopt
the
mechanical
test
which
the
petitioner
is
proposing
here,
what
you
wind
up
with
is
the
employees
and
other
persons
who
supply
labor
or
material,
being
the
ones
who
are
suffering
as
a
result
of
delegation,
or
self-delegation,
or
sub-delegation
of
work
on
a
construction
project.
in
another
words,
if
i
may,
in
this
particular
case
peirce
subcontracted
out
the
sprinkler
work.
now,
it
is
not
at
all
uncommon
in
a
large
government
project
where
the
mechanical
contractor
will
sub
out
the
sprinkler,
he
will
sub
out
the
underground
utilities,
he
will
sub
out
the
sheet
metal
work,
he
will
sub
out
the
pipe
covering
work,
he
will
sub
out
the
temperature
control
work.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
mr.
justice,
if
i
understand
your
point,
it
is
that
rich
was
only
making
a
distinction
between
material
man
versus
subcontractor,
if
that
so
we
would
still
submit,
although
i
do
believe
the
test
goes
further
than
that
in
rich,
but
we
would
still
submit
that
the
approach
the
court
used
in
rich
that
is
a
functional
type
test,
is
the
only
test
that
is
going
to
accommodate
the
two
purposes
that
we
understand
to
be
in
the
miller
act.
the
first
and
primary
purpose
is
to
protect
those
whose
labor
or
material
went
to
the
public
projects.
the
second
purpose
of
the
proviso
or
rather
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
to
the
miller
act
is
simply
to
make
sure
that
prime
contractor
has
some
means
of
protecting
himself
from
remote
claims.
now,
not
remote
claims
in
terms
of
number
of
tiers
people
are
down
where
they
would
be
1,
5
or
10,
but
remote
in
the
sense
that
the
defaulting
party
does
not
have
a
substantial
and
important
relationship
with
the
prime
because
if
he
does
have
that
kind
of
relationship,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
eliminate
contractors
down
this
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
if
they
had
a
contract
direct
with
the
prime,
i
believe
they
would
be
covered
under
the
miller
act,
there
would
be
no
issue
about
that.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
same
type
of
case
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
on
the
language
referring
to
the
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
sub-subcontractor,
yes.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
first
that,
at
best
it
is
ambiguous
because
the
act
itself
does
not
define
a
subcontractor,
so
with
the
act
not
defining
a
subcontractor,
it
is
difficult
to
assume
then
that
the
house
report
when
it
refers
to
sub-subcontractor
was
referring
to
a
definition
at
which
the
petitioner
urges
here.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
functional
definition
that
this
court
laid
out
in
rich
is
a
more
appropriate
one.
furthermore,
i
believe
that
again
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
many
times,
there
is
extensive
legislative
history.
on
the
other
side
of
this
problem,
and
that
is
the
legislative
history,
in
fact,
comments
by
chairman
miller
one
of
which
i
mentioned
earlier
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
miller
act
was
merely
to
straighten
out
these
problems
with
the
heard
act.
now,
with
that
being
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
the
legislative
history,
i
find
it
difficult
to
attribute
to
congress
then,
by
that
one
statement
in
the
house
report,
a
wholesale
elimination
of
classes
of
people
who
were
previously
covered,
in
effect
to
adopt
that
statement
as
some
sort
of
controlling
criteria,
would
mean
that
congress
decided
they
were
going
to
cover
just
tip
of
the
iceberg
and
eliminate
all
these
other
people
that
previously
be
covered.
i
believe
that
before
we
could
look
at
that
statement
as
controlling
there
would
have
to
be
far
more
legislative
history
similar
to
that
or
at
least
defining
what
they
meant
by
subcontractor
in
that
case.
if
i
may,
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
with
regard
to
the
remoteness
argument
and
i
believe
i
partially
got
into
it,
but
i
would
like
to
stress
the
fact
that
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
can
be
assumed,
or
it
can
be
presumed
that
congress
intended
when
it
adopted
the
miller
act
to
let
coverage
under
that
act,
be
controlled
by
the
contractors
who
were
on
the
job
and
basically
if
we
adopt
petitioner’s
contention
that
is
what
happens.
if
pierce
decides
to
do
the
work
himself,
pierce’s
employees
are
covered,
if
pierce
decides
to
subcontract
that
work
to
colquitt
or
somebody
else
to
do
the
work,
colquitt’s
employees
are
not
covered.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
there
are
many
that
do
that.
there
are
a
few
justice
rehnquist
which
we
have
found
which
would
in
effect
support
our
position.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
in
the
sense
that
you
could
not
have
the
mechanic’s
lien
on
a
federal
project,
the
heard
act
provided
for
the
bond
to
give
the
laborers
and
other
persons
who
supplied
material
on
the
job,
opportunities
to
collect,
but
i
think
this
point
is
particularly
crucial
that
the
rights
of
both
laborers
and
material
men
to
seek
recovery
under
the
miller
act
bond,
under
the
petitioner’s
contention
rests
on
how
much
sub
delegation
the
prime
or
someone
for
example
in
pierce’s
condition
decides
he
wants
to
on
the
job.
this
we
submit
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
rich
case
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
the
rich
case
even
if
it
is
not
found
controlling
in
this
situation
because
it
involved
a
supplier
to
a
material
man.
we
believe
the
test
itself
is
sound
and
was
stated
as
a
general
test
for
determining
subcontractor
under
the
miller
act
and
the
functional
aspects
of
it
can
be
applied
in
this
situation.
there
are
a
couple
more
points,
i
would
like
to
make
if
i
could.
the
another
factor
which
i
think
demonstrates
that
the
petitioner’s
privity
type
argument
is
not
valid
in
interpreting
the
miller
act,
is
the
situation
we
have
here
where
pierce
took
over
the
job
after
colquitt
was
unable
to
perform.
now,
under
the
petitioner’s
theory
of
the
case,
on
the
last
day
these
people
worked
for
colquitt,
they
were
not
covered
under
the
miller
act.
they
had
no
bond
coverage.
the
next
day
when
they
went
to
work
for
pierce
doing
precisely
the
same
work,
probably
hooking
one
piece
of
pipe
up
to
the
piece
of
pipe
they
hooked
up
yesterday.
they
were
then
covered.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
that
is
the
kind
of
line
drawing
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
my
point
is
that
line
drawing
based
upon
these
relationships
in
business.
in
other
words
what
the
pierce
and
colquitt
want
to
do
and
what
bateson
wants
to
do
with
them
should
not
be
controlling
in
interpreting
the
miller
act,
because
congress
there
said,
“look,
we
want
to
make
sure
people
whose
labor
goes
into
that
building,
get
paid.”
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
those
lines
as
i
recollect
mr.
chief
justice,
really
are
concerned
more
with
whether
someone
was
prompt
in
getting
his
claim
filed.
for
example,
whether
the
work
was
done
monday,
or
tuesday.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
think
the
line
drawing
there
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
yes,
i
realized
that
but
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
want
to
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
i
want
you
to
adopt
a
test,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
below
which
says
look,
we
look
at
the
facts
and
to
determine
if
there
is
this
substantial
and
important
relationship
because
there
is
only
one
reason
why
you
want
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
relationship,
because
if
there
is
such
relationship
then
the
defaulter
is
not
remote
from
the
prime.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
miller
act
bond
premium
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
set
in
the
act.
in
other
words
the
act
provides
the
limit
of
the
bond.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
the
premium,
as
i
recall
from
the
brief
submitted
by
the
surety
association
is
based
upon
a
percentage
of
the
bond.
in
other
words,
i
believe
it
is
one
half
a
percent
for
the
first
million
or
something
like
that.
they
did
also
point
out
in
their
brief
that
they
do
not
compute
these
premiums
on
an
actuarial
type
basis
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
but
again,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
crucial
because
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
what
congress
intended
to
do
when
it
adopted
the
statute.
certainly,
if
congress
was
concerned
for
example,
about
how
the
sureties
were
going
to
get
the
premiums
or
how
they
were
going
to
base
their
premium,
it
would
have
been
simple
to
say
we
are
not
going
to
have
any
bonds,
that
there
would
be
no
premium.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
it
did
not
go
that
far
and
that
is
correct,
but
i
would
point
out
that
if
congress
fully
intended
his
petitioner’s
argument
to
limit
the
bond
to
the
first-tier,
that
would
have
been
very
simple
to
say
in
the
proviso,
but
it
did
not
say
so.
on
the
contrary;
however,
if
that
again
as
petitioner
argues
that
congress
could
easily
have
said
who
was
covered
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
put
that
kind
of
language
in
the
proviso.
it
would
have
then
had
language
sub
sub
sub
sub
or
sub
of
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth
tier,
that
type
of
language,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
are
going
to
attribute
to
congress
that
intent
in
view
of
that.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
pierce
have
a
bond
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
well,
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
mr.
justice
white,
but
pierce
had
an
indemnity
agreement
with
bateson
to
indemnify
bateson
in
the
event,
bateson
did
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
they
have
no
claim
against
anyone
at
the
present
time.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
no,
sir.
the
problem
that
the
bateson
claims
exist
and
that
is
how
is
he
going
to
be
able
to
get
all
these
bonds
that
were
going
to
be
bonding
contractors
down
the
row.
we
do
not
believe
exists
because
there
are
several
ways
that
bateson
can
protect
themselves,
one
of
which
of
course
is
requiring
bonds.
he
required
one
of
pierce,
that
certainly
proves
he
can
do,
but
he
did
not
have
to
do
it.
pierce
could
certainly
have
required
one
of
colquitt.
now,
why
pierce
did
not
require
one
to
colquitt.
the
record
does
not
show,
counsel
indicates
this
because
colquitt
could
not
get
bonded.
well,
if
that
is
so,
in
effect
then,
pierce
is
telling
the
employees,
i
want
colquitt
on
the
job
probably
had
a
low
price.
colquitt
can
not
get
bonded,
so
if
colquitt
goes
belly
up
who
is
going
to
bear
the
risk
of
that,
you
employees.
i
simply
cannot
attribute
that
intent
to
congress.
now,
with
regard
to
the
argument
that
was
somewhat
touched
down
by
counsel
and
argued
extensively
in
the
briefs
and
that
is
that
the
interpretation,
they
are
suggesting
would
be
more
fair
to
small
contractors
that
the
interpretation
we
are
proposing,
would
in
effect
eliminate
small
contractors
from
coming
on
jobs
because
they
could
not
get
bonds
and
people
like
pierce’s
now
on
would
require
small
contractors
to
get
bonds.
i
think
the
argument
is
not
appropriate
in
this
case
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
small
contractors
can
merely
be
on
both
sides
of
this
question.
they
could
just
as
easily
be
claimants
as
they
can
defaulters
for
example,
if
colquitt
had
subbed
out
half
of
his
sprinkler
system
job
to
a
small
contractor,
that
small
contractor
would
be
standing
in
the
shoes
of
colquitt’s
employees
and
also
would
come
up
empty
handed,
so
i
doubt
if
a
small
contractor
is
going
to
take
much
comfort
in
petitioner’s
argument,
that
we
want
to
get
you
on
the
job,
even
though
you
cannot
be
bonded
and
then
have
that
same
small
contractor
find
out
that
when
he
cannot
get
paid,
he
cannot
go
against
the
bond
either.
furthermore,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
philosophy
of
the
miller
act
was
that
the
employee
should
bear
the
responsibility
for
a
marginally
weak
contractor.
certainly
the
federal
government
has
provided
other
means
to
get
jobs
for
small
contractors
and
federal
projects.
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
oh!
yes
sir.
my
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same
for
colquitt’s
material
men.
for
anyone
who
had
a
contract
with
colquitt
because
that
is
the
only
privity
which
the
act
requires
in
our
view
--
mr.
donald
j.
capuano
by
the
court
below?
yes
sir.
the
only
privity
that
is
necessary
is
the
privity
between
the
claimant
and
the
defaulting
party.
the
act
does
not
require
privity
between
the
defaulting
party
and
the
prime
to
show
that
the
defaulting
party
is
a
subcontractor.
i
have
concluded
my
argument
and
i
would
simply
like
to
request
that
the
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
feel
fully
adopted
the
decision
of
this
court
in
rich,
macevoy
and
properly
construed
the
miller
act.
thank
you.
