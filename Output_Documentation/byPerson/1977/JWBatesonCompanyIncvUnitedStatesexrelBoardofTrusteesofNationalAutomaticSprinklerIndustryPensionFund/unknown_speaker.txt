unknown
speaker
and
the
material
men
furnishing
materials
to
the
sub-sub?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
difference
between
the
employees
and
the
material
men
as
the
employees
were
doing
work
on
the
project?
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
doing
it
for
a
sub-sub
who
could
recover
the
contract
price?
unknown
speaker
and
who
would
be
protected
by
the
miller
act?
unknown
speaker
what
if
pierce
had
gone
to
bateson
and
said,
“we
do
not
think
where
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
do
this
sprinkler
work
and
we
want
your
permission
to
assign
that
part
of
our
subcontract
to
colquitt”
and
then
the
same
situation
had
developed,
would
the
parties
be
in
any
different
position
for
miller
act
purposes?
unknown
speaker
i
would
not
think
that
would
give
colquitt
a
contract
with
bateson
and
bateson
would
have
noticed
that
and
would
have
consented
to
an
assignment
from
pierce
to
colquitt?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
colquitt
looked
only
to
pierce
for
payment?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
they
may
submit
their
payroll
to
--
unknown
speaker
unless
you
hear
this
whether
the
court
below
was
correct
in
holding
colquitt
to
be
a
sub
not
a
sub-sub?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
as
what
they
said,
“colquitt
therefore
was
a
subcontractor
within
the
miller
act.”
that
was
their
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
but
they
went
on
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
must
yeah,
because
if
he
was
a
sub
you
would
not
be
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it
usual
for
the
main
contractor
to
require
his
own
consent
for
subcontracting?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
there
is
--
how
about
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
the
main
--
was
the
subcontractor
free
to
sub-sub
that
anybody
he
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
without
the
main
contractor
having
anything
to
set
about?
unknown
speaker
could
the
main
contractor
have
required
the
sub-sub
to
put
up
a
bond?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
here
held
that
--
unknown
speaker
that
the
main
contractor
could
have
protected
itself?
unknown
speaker
but
if
bateson
leaves
that
to
pierce
to
do
the
mechanical
and
leaves
pierce
free
to
sub
out
part
of
the
mechanical,
they
more
or
less
run
that
risk.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
did
require
pierce
to
provide
a
bond
in
it
and
would
not
pierce
if
it
had
known
that
this
--
pierce
is
really
the
one
who
is
going
to
get
stuck
here.
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
had
pierce
realized
how
the
court
of
appeals
are
going
to
decide
this
case
it
pretty
surely
would
have
required
a
bond
from
colquitt,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
law
would
not
have
known
that
the
law,
as
it
was
then
what
they
would
still
be
stuck,
if
colquitt
went
belly
up.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
think
mechanic's
lien
law
do
not
pay
off
according
to
you,
any
worker
who
works
on
the
project?
unknown
speaker
and
but
pierce
would.
unknown
speaker
but
was
it
not
correct
that
the
original
heard
act
was
intended
to
provide
a
substitute
form
of
protection
for
that
normally
available
under
state
law
by
way
of
the
mechanic's
lien
law.
unknown
speaker
and
your
point
is
that
miller
act
was
liberalized
there
by
recovering
the
payment
bond
as
well
as
performance
bond?
unknown
speaker
mr.
capuano,
--
unknown
speaker
if
colquitt
had
simply
delivered
sprinkling
equipment
to
the
job
and
that
pierce’s
employees
had
installed
that,
would
colquitt’s
employees
or
their
pension
fund
have
had
a
claim
under
a,
the
heard
act
or
b,
the
miller
act?
unknown
speaker
may
be
i
did
not
speak
while
asking
my
question,
i
joined
rich
and
i
certainly
understood
it
to
focus
on
whether
or
not
the
person
was
a
subcontractor
as
opposed
to
a
material
man
and
it
used
the
close
and
substantial
word
of
the
language
which
i
think
it
come
originally
from
macevoy,
but
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
we
can
more
or
less
discard
this
distinction
between
material
men
and
subcontractors
and
simply
focus
on
this
rather
abstract
descriptive
language?
unknown
speaker
how
about
security
guards
hired
by
the
prime
who
contribute
nothing
to
the
on
the
job
construction,
but
patrol
at
regularly
while
it
is
under
construction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
will
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
certainly
do
not
either
but
do
you
think
they
will
be
covered
under
the
miller
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
capuano,
on
your
remoteness
argument
which
is
very
persuasive,
but
the
problem
that
i
have
is
what
about
the
house
report,
seems
to
draw
the
line
one
step
shorter
where
you
take
this?
unknown
speaker
and
the
sub-subcontractor?
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
far
as
the
bill
goes,
what
do
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
i
gather
it
for
bateson,
for
colquitt’s
material
men?
unknown
speaker
because
colquitt
you
say
was
correctly
held
to
be
a
subcontractor?
unknown
speaker
anything
further
mr.
raphen?
unknown
speaker
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
