mr.
rephan,
i
do
not
find
in
the
briefs
any
discussion
of
what
the
normal
rule
is
in
the
mechanicsâ€™
lien
law
of
the
big
commercial
states
like
new
york,
and
illinois
and
california.
would
the
employees
of
a
sub-subcontractor
normally
be
entitled
to
protection
under
state
mechanic's
lien
law
in
situation
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
say
d.c.
that
would
not
be
the
case
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
think
that
is
the
rule
in
the
district.
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
law
generally
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
counsel,
is
it
not
fair
to
say
that
a
counsel
did
generally
intend
to
provide
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
would
be
available
under
state
mechanic's
lien
law
if
it
were
not
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
federal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
relevant
to
know
what
the
general
practices
throughout
the
country
on
this
sort
of
problem,
nobody
seems
to
have
talked
about
it
and
i
do
not
mean
to
single
out
anyone
jurisdiction,
but
is
it
not
what
congress
is
trying
to
do?
