mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
involves
interpretation
of
the
miller
act,
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
construction
industry,
particularly
those
contractors
doing
construction
for
the
federal
government.
the
petitioners
maintain
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
misconstrued
the
miller
act
in
defining
the
term
subcontractor
and
in
holding
that
the
respondents
may
maintain
this
action.
we
feel
your
honors
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
contrary
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
clifford
f.
macevoy
which
was
decided
back
in
1944
and
also
the
case
of
f.
d.
rich
co.
which
was
decided
in
1974.
also,
your
honors
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
contrary
of
the
holdings
of
the
first,
fourth,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
which
have
all
passed
in
this
issue.
we
believe
those
decisions
are
consistent
with
the
rich
case
and
with
the
macevoy
case
and
they
are
in
proper
interpretations
of
the
terms
of
the
miller
act.
the
material
facts
are
very
simple.
mr.
jack
rephan
the
general
service
administration
awarded
a
contract
to
bateson
to
bill
in
addition
to
the
howard
university
hospital
in
washington
d.c.,
a
contract
of
some
$39
million.
bateson
subcontracted
to
pierce
associates
all
of
the
mechanical
work
which
consisted
of
the
heating,
ventilation,
air
conditioning
and
also
included
the
installation
of
a
automatic
fire
sprinkler
system.
pierce
associates
in
turn
entered
into
a
subcontract
agreement
with
colquitt
sprinkler
co.
where
the
installation
for
the
automatic
sprinkler
system.
colquitt
had
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
with
the
respondent
union
and
under
the
terms
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
colquitt
was
required
to
withhold
certain
union
dues
and
fringe-benefits
from
the
pay
of
its
employees
and
paid
over
to
the
union
trustees.
colquitt
got
into
financial
trouble,
failed
to
pay
these
monies
over
for
the
period
of
may
1973,
through
december
'73
and
the
union
trustees
thereupon
gave
notice
to
bateson
under
the
miller
act
which
is
required
within
90
days
after
the
last
of
the
work
is
done
and
thereafter
when
bateson
refused
to
make
payment,
they
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes,
your
honor,
we
will
concede
that
issue
and
i
think
it
was
resolved
in
another
case
by
this
court;
however,
we
do
maintain
they
are
one
tier
down
and
they
are
at
a
little
bit
different
position
in
the
one
case
we
referred
to.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
actually
before
in
the
installation
and
furnishing
of
the
sprinkler
system
itself.
now,
in
the
macevoy
case,
this
court
had
before
the
issue
of
whether
a
material
man
to
a
material
man
on
a
federal
construction
project
was
covered
under
the
terms
of
the
miller
act
and
after
reviewing
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
the
court
said
that
the
bond
ran
only
to
those
material
men,
and
laborers,
and
subcontractors
who
deal
directly
with
the
prime
contractor
and
those
material
men,
laborers
and
subcontractors
who
lacking
any
express
or
implied
contract
with
the
prime
contractor,
nevertheless
had
a
direct
contractual
relationship
with
a
subcontractor
and
who
give
the
requisite
90
day
notice.
this
principle
was
reaffirmed
by
this
court,
we
believe
your
honors
in
the
rich
case,
the
distinction
in
rich
was
that
the
material
men
or
subcontractor
in
that
case,
a
company
by
the
name
of
serpac
had
two
contracts
with
the
prime
contractor,
one
contract
was
to
furnish
the
plywood
for
the
exterior
of
the
project
and
the
other
contract
was
to
detail
and
install
all
of
the
mill
work.
there
were
some
other
very
important
facts
in
that
case
namely,
that
the
stock
holdings
for
the
two
companies
were
closely
interrelated,
the
management
of
the
two
companies
were
interrelated
they
had
done
work
on
other
projects
and
we
believe
your
honors
that
in
that
case
when
the
court
said,
we
have
got
to
look
beyond
the
terms
of
the
contract
to
see
whether
or
not
serpac
was
functioning
as
a
material
man
or
as
a
subcontractor,
that
the
court
had
in
mind
that
distinction
and
this
was
the
purpose
of
applying
a
substantial
relationship
test
in
the
rich
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
middle
party
was
a
subcontractor
or
a
material
man.
i
think
your
honors,
if
i
might
refer
you
to
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case,
where
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
this
distinction
between
subcontractors
and
material
men
turns
on
a
substantiality
and
importance
of
the
relationship
between
the
middle
party
and
the
prime
contractor.
mr.
jack
rephan
your
honor,
if
you
go
back
to
the
purpose
of
the
miller
act,
it
may
make
some
sense
because
historically,
and
even
the
district
of
columbia
mechanic's
lien
law,
for
example
limits,
the
coverage
to
a
subcontractor
not
beyond.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that,
that
probably
makes
more
sense
than
to
apply
this
test
in
a
vacuum
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
they
misconstrued
and
misread
what
this
court
was
talking
about
when
they
used
the
substantiality
test
that
the
court
in
the
rich
case
was
trying
to
ascertain
whether
this
party
was
a
material
man
or
was
a
subcontractor
and
they
elect
to
both
contracts
the
entire
relationship
between
the
parties
and
serpac
was
doing
contract
work,
they
were
not
limited
to
supplying
of
material
and
that
is
what
the
court
had
in
mind
of
that
case.
now,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not,
colquitt,
the
sprinkler
installer
was
a
subcontractor
and
we
feel
under
the
traditional
view
and
the
traditional
definition
of
the
term
subcontractor
that
colquitt
was
not
a
subcontractor,
sure
they
were
installing
work,
they
were
installing
some
of
the
materials
on
the
job,
but
if
we
go
back
to
the
definition
of
subcontract,
it
would
this
court
referred
to
in
the
macevoy
case
one
who
takes
part
of
the
work
from
the
prime
contractor,
we
maintain
colquitt
is
not
within
that
category.
colquitt
is
a
sub-subcontractor
and
these
terms
have
been
used
in
the
construction
industry
and
day-to-day
references
of
the
term
for
many
years
and
we
believe
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
subcontractor
and
a
sub-subcontractor.
and
certainly
congress,
we
feel
had
this
distinction
in
mind,
and
the
committee
reports
because
they
said
a
sub-subcontractor
is
covered
by
the
act
but
that
is
as
far
as
it
goes.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes,
your
honor
i
think
that
was
even
referred
to
by
this
court
in
the
macevoy
opinion
to
the
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
sub-subcontractor?
mr.
jack
rephan
colquitt
was
a
sub-subcontractor
your
honor,
and
colquitt
would
have
been
covered
by
the
act,
we
are
talking
about
the
employees
of
colquitt
one
step
removed,
now
colquitt,
had
pierce
not
paid
colquitt,
certainly,
colquitt
could
have
given
notice
to
bateson
and
come
and
made
a
claim
of
the
act,
but
we
are
talking
about
their
employees,
which
is
one
step
removed
when
colquitt
as
a
sub-subcontractor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
right.
same
category
your
honor,
it
would
not
make
any
difference,
whether
it
is
employees
or
whether
it
was
a
material
man
of
the
sub-sub,
we
say
that
neither
of
them
would
be
covered.
they
are
all
in
a
third-tier
or
beyond.
you
have
the
prime
as
first-tier,
you
had
pierce
the
second-tier,
colquitt
in
third-tier.
the
third-tier
people
would
be
covered
beyond
that
they
clearly
not
covered.
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
the
distinction
is
important
here,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
now,
certainly
the
respondents
would
like
to
say
there
is
a
distinction
because
these
people
were
actually
working
on
the
project,
but
every
bit
of
laborer,
every
bit
of
material
man
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
sub-sub
could
--
mr.
jack
rephan
the
sub-sub
was
protected
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
congress
said
in
the
committee
report
and
i
think
if
we
analyze
a
notice
requirement
this
would
support
our
position.
the
statute
requires
only
those
persons
having
a
direct
contract
with
a
subcontractor
to
give
notice
and
only
to
the
prime
contractor,
this
would
leave
out
a
subcontractor
such
as
pierce
here.
pierce
in
effect
would
have
no
notice
that
colquitt
had
not
paid
their
employees.
the
notice
would
go
to
the
prime
contractor
and
pierce
of
course,
is
one
of
those
protected
parties
under
the
miller
act.
peirce
had
a
direct
contract
with
the
prime
contractor
and
therefore
it
is
expressly
covered
under
the
act
and
the
question
arises
in
my
mind
your
honors,
as
why
at
the
end
did
congress
not
provide
that
those
tiers
below
that
first-tier
subcontractor
give
notice
to
the
subcontractor,
so
that
he
could
protect
himself.
in
fact,
in
this
case
if
there
is
going
to
be
double
payment
it
would
be
by
pierce
associates,
the
first-tier
subcontractor.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
carefully
read
the
rich's
decision
because
i
think
the
rich
decision
and
again
i
think
too
that
the
all
of
the
cases
which
were
cited
in
the
rich
case,
i
believe
in
a
footnote
on
the
principle
relied
on
by
the
court
to
define
the
term
subcontractor,
involved
a
situation
where
the
party,
we
were
talking
about,
to
be
a
material
man
or
being
the
subcontractor,
had
some
sort
of
a
contractor
relationship
with
the
prime.
now,
there
are
cases
where
you
have
a
prime
contractor,
you
have
another
corporation
may
be
a
wholly
own
subsidiary,
of
the
prime,
and
the
courts
in
those
cases
have
more
or
less,
pierced
a
corporate
veil.
they
do
not
feel
where
you
have
a
wholly
own
controlled
subsidiary,
that
has
no
economic
reality
that
a
prime
contractor
should
be
able
to
put
this
buried
in
there
and
push
the
material
men
or
laborers
down
one
tier
and
therefore
exclude
them
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes
your
honor,
in
that
situation
they
would
be
because
colquitt
then
would
have
a
contract
with
bateson
and
we
think
this
is
what
the
court
is
talking
about
when
they
talk
about
those
few
contractors,
of
doing
their
job
on
fields.
mr.
jack
rephan
if
pierce
assigned
the
portion
of
its
contract
work
to
colquitt
then
it
would
seem
your
honor,
that
colquitt
would
stand
on
the
same
contractual
tier
then
with
pierce.
they
would
have
a
contract
with
bateson.
they
would
look
to
bateson
for
the
payment.
bateson
could
then
control
them
and
protect
themselves.
they
could
say
to
colquitt,
we
want
you
to
put
up
a
bond
and
of
course,
if
colquitt
could
not
make
the
bond,
bateson
would
then
have
a
choice
not
to
permit
the
work
to
be
done
by
colquitt.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor,
colquitt
had
no
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
that
is
a
requirement
almost
all
federal
construction
projects
today
that
these
payrolls
go
through
the
general
contractor
to
the
owner.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
true
your
honor,
they
said
that
technically
colquitt
was
a
sub-subcontractor,
but
then
they
in
effect
said,
“this
makes
no
difference.”
in
fact,
in
the
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
true
your
honor.
you
will
note
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
two
on
page,
i
have
a
slip
opinion,
on
page
4,
they
said
in
the
case
before
as
the
union’s
contract
was
with
colquitt
which
was
technically
a
sub-subcontract
--
mr.
jack
rephan
then
they
went
on
and
reached
conclusion
that
there
were
a
subcontractor
and
we
take
issue
of
that
your
honor,
we
think
that
--
mr.
jack
rephan
we
would
not
be
here
your
honor.
i
think
one
leading
case
the
court
should
look
at
is
the
elmer
case
which
was
the
fifth
circuit
case
and
that
case
followed
macevoy
and
they
discussed
macevoy
in
that.
this
precise
issue
is
there
and
it
is
simply
a
question
of
what
did
congress
mean
when
they
used
the
term
subcontractor,
were
they
speaking
about
the
traditional
subcontractor,
one
having
a
contractor
relationship
with
the
prime
contractor
or
they
are
talking
about
any
person
who
does
both
labor
and
and
material
and
as
distinguished
among
a
pure
material
man.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
only
jurisdictions
i
did
check
out
or
the
local
jurisdiction,
maryland,
virginia,
the
district
of
columbia,
the
d.c.
code
--
mr.
jack
rephan
d.c.
has
a
definition
of
the
term
subcontract
in
the
statute
itself
in
section
38103
of
the
d.c.
code
and
this
defined
as
any
person
directly
employed
by
the
original
contract
whether
as
a
subcontractor,
material
man
or
labor
to
furnish
work
or
materials
with
the
conditional
work
contracted
for
as
aforesaid
and
i
think
--
mr.
jack
rephan
law
generally
your
honor,
in
my
own
experience
has
been,
it
only
goes
down
to
that
first
level.
i
know
in
virginia
state
away.
mr.
jack
rephan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
there
was
no
slide
intended
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
had
our
hands
full
here
with
the
district
of
columbia
and
we
thought
this
is
where
we
need
some
clarification.
mr.
jack
rephan
well
in
the
contracting
procedures,
your
honor,
normally
the
big
contractor
is
your
mechanical,
and
electrical
as
contrary
to
structural
unless
the
general
contractor
does
that
and
that
is
95%
of
the
work
--
mr.
jack
rephan
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
automatic
sprinkler
work
is
sort
of
a
specialized
work,
most
mechanical
subcontractor
will
not
do
it.
mr.
jack
rephan
true
your
honor.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
jack
rephan
they
could
have
required
it,
but
--
mr.
jack
rephan
it
is
clear
i
do
not
--
mr.
jack
rephan
they
could
have
required
a
bond
here
your
honor,
but
it
is
clear
also
that
colquitt
could
never
have
obtained
a
bond
and
this
is
one
of
the
problems
as
you
get
down
in
the
lower
tiers,
these
people
simply
are
not
bondable.
there
is
no
way
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
bonds.
further
done
are
usually
small
companies
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
right.
they
could
not
require
pierce
to
secure
bonds
from
all
of
their
sub-sub
people.
they
had
no
privity
with
those
people.
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
true
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
they
would
have
your
honor,
of
course
they
were
relying
on
what
they
believed
to
be
the
law
at
their
time.
the
elmer
case
and
the
other
cases
and
the
way
they
interpreted
the
decisions
of
the
this
court
--
mr.
jack
rephan
well,
it
is
a
practical
matter
your
honor,
the
only
way
that
someone
in
pierce’s
position,
could
protect
themselves
would
be
to
withhold
payment
from
colquitt
and
this
is
really
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
miller
act.
the
subcontractor
simply
can
afford
a
man
to
his
jobs,
if
the
big
subs
are
going
to
hold
up
their
payment
and
that
is
the
only
way
they
can
finance
these
jobs
and
this
is
the
only
way
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
that
a
major
sub
such
as
pierce
could
protect
itself.
colquitt
was
not
bondable.
in
fact,
there
was
a
requirement
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
that
colquitt
put
up
a
bond
to
protect
the
trustees
on
the
very
payments
which
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
the
trustees
waived
this
bond
requirement,
and
they
admit
that
there
were
not
reason
they
waive
it,
there
was
no
vehicle
to
sphere
bound
it.
this
is
the
problem
what
happened
is
that
the
industry
is
going
to
be
limited
to
those
people
who
have
the
financial
and
size,
ability
to
man
these
major
projects.
we
believe
your
honors,
that
and
we
are
talking
about
those
few
contractors
that
the
general
contractor
can
protect
themselves
against
which
speaking
of
the
major
subcontractors,
the
mechanical,
the
electrical,
but
you
have
some
very
specialize
sub-subcontractors,
particularly
on
the
federal
projects
being
constructed
today.
security
systems,
security
glass,
and
locks
for
a
jail
and
it
goes
on
down
the
line
and
these
are
being
furnished
and
installed.
theoretically,
they
could
come
within
the
definition
of
subcontractors
defined
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
but
we
think
that
congress
never
intended
that
the
prime
contractor
would
have
to
protect
themselves
against
these
many
hundreds
of
small
subcontractors.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
stevens
that
is
exactly
correct
that,
that
the
miller
act
--
mr.
jack
rephan
that
is
exactly
what
they
were
doing
your
honor,
because
there
was
no
way
you
could
enforce
a
lien
against
government
owned
property.
the
mechanic's
lien
law,
you
enforce
your
lien
by
ordering
a
court,
sale
of
the
property.
this
could
not
be
done
in
the
case
of
federally
owned
property.
as
i
said
your
honor,
the
jurisdictions,
that
i
am
familiar
with
all
have
some
limitations,
traditionally
i
think
it
is
only
going
down
to
the
first-tier
subcontract,
is
that
way
in
the
district
of
columbia,
it
is
that
way
in
virginia
and
i
think
it
is
that
way
in
maryland
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
what
was
replacing
when
they
enacted
the
miller
act
and
certainly
when
they
put
limiting
language
in
there
and
used
the
term
sub-subcontractor
as
well
as
subcontractor
that
they
are
trying
to
go
down
to
a
specified
tier,
but
the
miller
act
goes
one
tier
further
than
most
state
mechanic's
lien
law.
it
says
any
--
mr.
jack
rephan
no,
your
honor
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
reading
here,
in
the
d.c.
code,
if
there
is
any
person
directly
employed
by
the
prime
contractor,
only,
his
employees,
his
subs,
his
material
men
-
that
is
as
far
as
he
goes.
and
i
think
this
is
true
in
virginia
too.
in
the
miller
act,
we
have
those
people
who
have
a
direct
contract
with
the
prime
contractor
that
would
include
the
laborers
of
the
prime
contractor,
the
material
suppliers,
and
the
subcontractors.
then,
we
have
any
person
having
any
a
direct
contract
with
a
subcontractor,
so
it
would
be
the
material
suppliers,
the
sub-subs,
the
laborers
to
a
sub,
and
did
i
mention
material
men
to
the
sub?
beyond
that
we
think
that,
that
is
what
this
court
meant
when
they
said
those
in
more
remote
relationships.
mr.
jack
rephan
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
is
true,
there
is
not
mechanic's
lien,
there
is
other
statutory
protection
but
it
is
not
under
the
mechanic's
lien
law.
mr.
jack
rephan
pierce
would
your
honor,
pierce
is
a
subcontractor,
and
of
course
it
becomes
even
more
difficult
though
in
a
state
like,
i
think,
virginia,
and
maryland
where
the
general
contractor
has
paid
the
subcontractor.
this
will
extinguish
the
mechanic's
lien
rights,
so
that
the
rights
are
somewhat
limited
and
it
was
quite
obvious
that
this
was
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
and
it
--
your
honors
realized
it
started
with
the
heard
act,
which
was
the
forerunner
of
the
miller
act.
however,
the
proviso
was
interjected
into
the
miller
act
and
this
is
what
the
court
had
to
interpret
in
the
macevoy
case.following
macevoy,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
are
at
least
four
circuits
that
have
ruled
precisely
the
way
we
are
asking
this
court
to
rule
today.
and
we
think
also
that
the
rich
case
did
not
alter
the
test
in
the
macevoy
case.
all
rich
said
was
here
we
have
an
issue
is
this
rich
man
really
a
material
man
or
is
he
really
a
subcontractor.
the
man
i
am
speaking
about
was
surpac
(ph).
surpac
(ph)
had
a
very
close
relationship
with
the
prime
contractor.
obviously,
the
prime
contractor
could
protect
themselves.
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
with
the
little
time
i
have.
mr.
jack
rephan
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
one
of
the
very
difficult
problems
we
have
with
the
test
urged
by
the
respondents
is
it
is
an
unworkable
test.
here
we
had
a
$39
million
contract.
sprinkler
work
with
approximately
155,000
and
156,000.
if
we
use
a
substantiality
test
let
us
assume
we
had
sprinkler
system
in
one
room
as
$10,000
by
their
subcontractor,
suppose
it
is
$500,000
or
they
have
subcontractor
and
who
is
going
to
make
these
determinations.
it
is
going
to
be
the
general
contractor,
who
obviously
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
because
they
are
not
awarding
the
sub-sub-subcontractors.
it
is
going
to
have
to
be
the
subcontractor
and
in
turn
his
subcontractor
on
down
the
line
and
we
believe
your
honor
it
is
really,
truly
an
unworkable
test
as
far
as
drawing
the
lines,
we
think
this
court
recognized
that
congress
in
the
miller
act
drew
the
line
not
rightly
or
wrongly,
it
may
well
be
that
extension
of
the
miller
act
should
be
brought.
we
feel
that
is
a
matter
for
congress
that
they
feel
this
way
they
can
redefine
the
coverage,
but
we
think
the
way
as
to
find
right
now
this
was
an
attempt
by
congress
to
draw
a
line
to
show
some
definition
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
violates
that
boundary
line,
in
effect
it
eliminates
the
proviso
of
section
2
of
the
act
which
this
court
had
before
in
the
rich
case
and
macevoy
case
and
which
was
to
the
proviso
involved
in
all
of
the
circuit
court
opinions
who
held
that
a
subcontractor
is
a
subcontractor
in
the
usual
meaning
of
this
term
and
this
term
was
used
in
the
building
trade
industries,
and
certainly
this
court
recognized
that
in
macevoy
and
we
think
this
is
what
congress
meant
when
they
said
subcontractor.
thank
you.
