we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1476
bateson
against
united
states.
mr.
rephan,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
capuano.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
is
it
not
absolutely
natural
consequence
of
all
kinds
of
line
drawing
but
we
encountered
in
a
full
range
of
business
and
commercial
relationships?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
statesâ€™
lien
actions
frequently
the
central
issue
or
the
only
issue
was
whether
the
work
or
the
material
was
completed
on
monday
of
the
given
week
or
tuesday
and
that
there
are
material
lines
drawn
under
a
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
the
same
general
kind
of
line
drawing,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
lose
your
case
if
you
--
i
am
just
surprised
that
you
would
want
to
put
so
much
weight
on
that
kind
of
a
point.
you
do
not
lose
your
case
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
