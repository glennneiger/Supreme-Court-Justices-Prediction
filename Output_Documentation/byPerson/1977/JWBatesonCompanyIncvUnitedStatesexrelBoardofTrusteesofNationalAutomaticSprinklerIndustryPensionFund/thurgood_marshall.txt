in
the
other
case
j.w.
bateson
co.,
is
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
question
in
that
case
is
whether
a
firm
that
is
technically
a
sub-contractor,
can
be
considered
a
sub-contractor
for
purposes
of
recovery
by
its
employees
under
a
miller
act
payment
bond.
petitioners
had
a
construction
contract
with
the
united
states
government
and
pasted
a
payment
bond
as
required
by
the
act.
petitioner
sub-contracted
part
of
the
work
to
a
firm
known
as
pierce
associates
which
in
turn
sub-contracted
a
part
with
colquitt
sprinkler
co..
when
colquitt
defaulted
on
certain
of
its
obligations
to
its
employees
and
their
union,
the
union
filed
against
petitioner
under
the
miller
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
by
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
statutory
language
in
the
legislative
history
make
clear
that
congress
meant
the
term
sub-contractor
as
used
in
the
act
to
include
only
those
who
had
a
contract
with
the
prime
contractor.
colquitt
could
have
confessed
-
could
have
claimed
against
the
bond
appears
defaulted
the
employees
of
colquitt
were
not
similarly
protected,
because
they
did
not
have
a
contractual
relationship
with
pierce
or
any
other
sub-contractor.
virtually,
all
reported
decisions
to
consider
this
question
had
concluded
as
we
do
at
those
who
contracted
with
a
sub-contractor
are
not
protected
by
the
miller
act
payment
bond.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
to
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
