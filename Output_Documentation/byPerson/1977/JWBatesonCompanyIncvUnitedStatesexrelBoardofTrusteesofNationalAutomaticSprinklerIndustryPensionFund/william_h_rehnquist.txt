william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
question
that
they
have
the
same
standings
as
with
the
laborers
for?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
colquitt
did
do
installation
work
on
the
job?
they
did
not
simply
furnish
material?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
really
make
sense
to
you
or
do
you
support
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
it
not
make
then,
a
lot
more
sense,
as
they
are
talking
about
the
substantiality
of
the
relationship
to
draw
the
line
between
the
traditional
material
man
who
simply
furnishes
goods
to
the
job
site
which
are
installed
by
another
entity
and
a
subcontractor
who
installs
the
stuff,
actually
puts
the
stuff
into
the
ground
that
he
can
no
longer
lien
for
because
it
is
public
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
congress
said
a
sub-subcontractor
is
covered
by
the
act,
but
that
is
as
far
it
goes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
not
that
cut
against
your
argument
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
concede
then
that
colquitt
was
a
sub-subcontract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
employees
then
are
in
your
view
a
step
removed
in
the
subcontractor
material
men?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rephan
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
you
also
i
know
that
you
did
not
cite
any
law
from
the
fast
growing
south
western
states
like,
colorado
and
arizona?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
virginia,
pierce’s
employees
who
had
worked
on
the
job
installing
other
mechanical
stuff
would
not
have
any
laborer’s
lien
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
not
be
true
in
arizona,
the
law
would
be
different;
that
they
would
have
a
plan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
have
real
difficulty
though
when
you
try
to
break
it
down
under
an
abstract
description
like
that
as
to
just
who
is
covered
and
who
is
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
true
under
what
you
say
congress
did
not
intend
in
the
miller
act,
is
is
true
under
most
states’
mechanic
lien
statute
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
you
did
not
say
that
the
heard
act
as
originally
drafted
was
intended
as
substitute
for
state
mechanical
lien
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
compute
a
miller
act
bond
premium?
if
you
got
that
vaguer
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
talking
about
the
mode
of
coverage,
i
am
talking
about
the
premium
that
the
general
has
to
pay
to
the
insurance
company
to
get
the
bond?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
do
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
congress
could
likewise
and
passed
a
law
that
had
none
of
the
limitations
that
the
miller
act
had
in
it
and
simply
said
that
anybody
who
has
come
near
the
project
and
that
it
has
not
been
paid
can
recover
under
the
bond.
we
both
agree
it
has
done
neither
of
those
things?
