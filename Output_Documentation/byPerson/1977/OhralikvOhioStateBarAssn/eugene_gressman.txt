mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
supreme
court
of
ohio,
which
ordered
that
the
appellant
albert
ohralik
be
suspended
indefinitely
from
the
practice
of
the
law
in
ohio
on
the
ground
that
he
did
solicit
and
obtain
retainer
agreements
from
two
accident
victims
in
violation
of
two
sections
of
disciplinary
code
of
professional
responsibility,
numbers
103
(a)
and
104
(a)
under
canon
2
of
the
code.
now
it
is
important
to
understanding
the
sole
and
the
critical
issue
now
before
this
court.
to
understand
that
there
was
a
single
unitary
charge
and
finding
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
this
appellant.
the
charge
was
that
he
did
solicit
and
did
obtain
agreements
from
these
two
individuals.
the
finding
was
that
he
did
solicit
and
did
obtain
agreements
from
these
two
individuals.
this
fall
squarely
without
more
within
the
ambient
of
these
two
disciplinary
rules,
which
in
affect
prohibit
a
lawyer
from
recommending
his
own
employment
or
accepting
employment
from
a
layman,
who
has
not
sought
his
advise
regarding
the
employment
of
an
attorney.
so
that
based
upon
that
simple
determination,
the
federal
constitutional
issue
was
premised
and
raised
in
the
court
below
and
it
has
being
accepted
for
review
by
this
court
to
it.
does
the
first
amendment
entitle
a
lawyer
to
recommend
his
own
employment
or
to
accept
employment
in
the
context,
the
simple
context
of
giving
unsolicited
advice,
respecting
the
need
for
counsel
and
respecting
the
desirability
of
taking
legal
action,
which
the
perspective
client
may
be
ignored.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
disciplinary
rule
reads.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
that
is
essentially
--
it
is
combination
i
would
suspect
of
giving
legal
advice
about
the
need.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
recommending
himself,
and
in
the
context
of
course,
of
a
situation
where
that
person
does
not
come
to
the
lawyer
seeking
such
advice
and
recommendation.
now
in
this
limited
context,
i
think,
our
first
point
has
to
be
an
understanding,
of
just
what
are
the
basic
elements
of
this
kind
of
solicitation
of
legal
business.
as
i
view
it,
reading
the
text
of
these
disciplinary
rules,
the
elements
are
first
a
truthful
conveying
of
information
concerning
the
person's
possible
legal
rights
and
conveying
of
truthful
information
concerning
his
need
for
counsel.
second
element
that
the
lawyer
speaks
with
a
commercial
or
profit
seeking
element
in
mind,
he
is
soliciting
business
for
the
sake
of
his
personal
pecuniary
gain,
as
most
lawyers
do
practice
law
for
pecuniary
gain.
thirdly,
like
many
commercial
solicitations,
this
one
may
be
and
is
designed
to
be
the
most
persuasive
in
nature.
and
fourth,
the
element
that
is
already
been
mentioned
that
ordinarily
according
to
the
rule,
this
kind
of
conveying
of
information
and
solicitation
is
in
the
context
of
proffering
unsolicited
legal
advice
and
conveying
the
need
for
counsel,
competent
counsel
who
represent
the
individual
in
pursuit
of
what
may
be
his
legal
rights.
mr.
eugene
gressman
an
examination
of
his
--
you
mean
speaking
of
the
doctor
now.
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
doctors
have
ever
aggressively
sought
the
medical
practice
in
that
manner
and
all
the
--
basically
that
would
be
essentially
the
same
situation,
i
would
agree.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
if
they
do,
i
would
say
that
it
is
essentially
the
same
situation.
i
suppose
there
are
many
doctors
who
may,
in
the
company
of
their
friends,
notice
a
medical
problem
that
might
encourage
him
to
do
exactly
what
the
chief
justice
suggest
that
he
come
in
for
an
examination.
that
may
be
done
informally
or
otherwise.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
many
programs
that
solicit
individuals
to
have
medical
examinations
to
check
their
heart,
to
check
possible
cancer
symptoms
and
what
have
you.
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
will
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
i
suppose
in
the
medical
field
you
get
more
of
that
in
the
organizational
areas
and
that
individuals
are
--
doctors
are
not
as
many
in
number
compared
to
the
types
of
organizations
that
would,
you
might
say,
solicit
medical
treatment
by
unsuspecting
victims
of
some
defect.
now,
in
a
real
sense,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
action,
the
context
in
which
this
commercialized
solicitation
does
occur
to
with
that
freely
giving
a
legal
advice
and
recommendation
of
attorneys
is
really
in
the
highest
tradition
of
the
profession.
this
may
not
be
an
ideal
way
of
obtaining
a
legal
business
but
then
and
certainly
is
not
the
only
way,
but
the
freedom
the
circumstance
of
discussing,
conveying
legal
information
and
advice
to
those
most
in
need
of
is
a
situation
that
i
think
warrants
commendation
rather
than
condemnation,
and
leads
to
my
next
point,
as
to
what
it
is
about
this
kind
of
solicitation
that
has
encouraged
the
wrath
and
the
prohibition
by
the
organized
bar
of
this
solicitation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
would
say
in
given
situations
that
might
be
true
if
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
if
he
is
doing
it
in
terms
of
the
precise
case
he
is
prosecuting,
that
is
one
thing.
i
was
suggesting
normally
that
he
might
give
an
individual
advice
to
him
about
a
collateral
or
unrelated
legal
problem
which
he
is
not
directly
involved
in.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
that
is
another
problem.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
we
use
the
term
conflict
of
interest
or
in
which
the
disciplinary
code
be
used
as
a
concept.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
if
you
accept
that
doctrine
mr.
justice
stevens
that
would
mean
that
no
lawyer
should
take
a
case
where
he
has
discussed
with
the
client
who
has
come
to
you,
the
advice
ability
of
instituting
legal
suit
of
some
sort
because
inevitably
if
this
solicitation
or
rather
this
advice
is
sought
in
the
first
instance
by
the
client
himself,
the
lawyer
may
inevitably
have
his
own
self
interest
and
may
give
advice
that
will
promote
his
own
interest
in
obtaining
that
case.
so
i
think
that
is
an
inevitable
situation
when
you
have
the
lawyers
talking
with
the
clients.
mr.
eugene
gressman
he
may
be
paying
for
that
initial
consultation
or
he
may
not.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
frankly
have
given
that
type
of
free
advice
many
times
myself
to
individuals
who
come
to
me
with
a
problem,
should
i
take
my
case
supreme
court,
and
without
charging
them
anything.
i
will
give
my
estimation
of
that
so
it
is
not
--
it
could
a
consultation
fee
or
it
could
not.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
essentially
the
difference
your
honor,
yes,
and
i
think
that
what
happens
after
that
is
likely
to
be
fairly
identical
in
nature.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
many
of
them
do
it,
that
is
right
[laughter].
that
is
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
situation
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
would
say
that
an
insurance
lawyer
may
not
go
into
the
hospital
room
and
seek
to
settle
a
case
with
a
victim
there.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
evil
or
what
he
has
got
the
cause
for
this,
the
rationale
for
this
disciplinary
prohibition
of
solicitation
is
not
in
terms
of
its
communicative
aspects.
they
are
not
really
objecting
to
this
lawyer
conveying
to
the
prospective
client,
advice
about
his
legal
rights
nor
are
they
really
objecting
to
soliciting
his
own
employment
or
conveying
information
about
his
own
availability
as
counsel
in
the
situation.
certainly
they
are
not
objecting
to
a
system,
imperfect
though
it
maybe,
by
which
legal
representation
is
accorded
an
individual
who
might
not
otherwise
either
know
of
his
legal
rights
or
have
counsel
available
to
him.
now,
we
must
turn
rather
to
what
this
court
turned
to
in
the
bates
decision
last
term
about
the
historical
basis
of
the
rules
against
advertising
by
attorneys,
which
not
strangely
enough
and
have
the
same
historical
source
as
the
ban
on
solicitation.
and
that
is
that
the
ban
on
solicitation
like
the
ban
on
advertising
originated
in
the
inns
of
court
of
england
as
a
matter
of
etiquette
that
the
barristers
simply
as
gentlemen
of
the
bar
do
not
seek
to
compete
with
each
other;
they
do
not
seek
to
solicit,
to
advertise,
to
act
as
ordinary
tradesmen
act.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
but
they
still
have
the
rules
against
advertising
and
soliciting
which
have
been
the
source
from
which
we
have
inherited
the
concepts
against
advertising.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
let
me
have
what
you
would
like
to
call
a
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
true.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
he
has
very
rigid
rule
of
etiquette
that
would
prohibit
him
even
from
attempting
to
contact
a
client.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
but,
what
is
significant
about
this
as
it
was
in
the
bates
case
is
that
this
was
developed
in
england,
as
a
matter
of
etiquette
and
to
this
very
day
the
ban
on
solicitation
with
respect
to
barristers
in
england
--
and
i
have
cited
this
pamphlet
in
my
brief
--
is
contained
in
a
pamphlet
put
out
by
the
inner
temple
addressed
to
the
barristers
entitled
conduct
and
etiquette
at
the
bar.
now,
in
other
words,
this
was
a
basic
matter
of
good
manners
and
etiquette
as
to
how
a
lawyer
should
conduct
himself
vis-à-vis
other
attorneys.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
assume
they
do
and
they
probably
inherited
this
notion
too
from
the
original
rules
of
etiquette.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
but
i
think,
the
same
etiquette,
the
same
manners
in
this
sense
have
been
adopted
by
the
solicitors
as
well.
and
henry
drinker’s
great
volume
on
legal
ethics,
the
prime
authority
in
this
field
has
noted
this
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
these
rules
that
we
now
have
in
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
are
largely
derived
from,
inherited
from
what
can
only
be
described
and
what
is
described
by
this
court
last
term
in
bates
as
matters
of
etiquette.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
that
i
am
saying
that,
that
i
think
you
have
to
have
an
understanding
of
what
the
motivation
or
the
origin
behind
this
rule.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
basically
they
do
when
they
are
saying
that
this
solicitation
like
they
said
about
advertising
is
contrary
to
the
high
ideals
of
the
profession.
what
high
ideals
other
than,
this
is
not
the
way
gentleman
of
the
bar
should
offer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true;
that
is
not
--
those
are
later
day
justifications.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
now
i
might
say
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
i
do
not
think
in
the
first
place
any
lawyer
is
on
the
same
parity
with
a
layman.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course,
he
is
supposed
to
be
and
that
is
what
he
is
in
the
business
of
practicing
law
among
other
reasons,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
should
not
promote
those
qualities
in
appropriate
situations
where
he
does
not
overreach
himself
or
he
does
not
incur
any
of
the
attended
evils
that
may
arise
out
of
taking
advantage
of
an
individual
who
is
not
in,
say,
full
control
of
all
of
his
faculties.
that
is
another
problem.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
there
are
many
instances
where
solicitation
occurs
and
is
permitted
where
there
is
no
element
of
overreaching.
that
is
not
an
inherent
part
of
these
disciplinary
prohibitions
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
now,
by
the
very
terms,
they
carve
out
an
exception
for
soliciting
your
close
friends,
your
relatives,
your
former
clients
and
those
whom
you
reasonably
may
think
is
a
client.
now
this
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
it
is
impossible
to
say
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
speech
is
protected.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
not
sure
i
would
designate
accepting
employment
as
a
matter
of
conduct,
i
think
that
is
an
essential
attribute
or
result
of
the
oral
communications
between
the
two
individuals.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think,
well
perhaps,
but
i
would
not
want
to
concede
that
that
is
such
conduct
that
it
need
be
regulated
to
the
detriment
of
what
i
concede
to
be
first
amendment
freedom.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
it
--
the
ohio
court
did
not
make
a
distinction
in
this
case
between
the
application
of
these
two
rules
so
we
do
not
know
what
they
meant
to
apply
to
which
situation
or
not.
now
i
would
say
though
that
if
you
were
to
agree
that
there
was
protected
speech
here
i
think
the
same
result
would
have
to
follow
under
104
that
the
result
of
that
speech,
the
formation
of
a
retainer
agreement
was
also
a
protected
activity
because
i
am
not
sure
that
in
any
of
the
decided
cases
in
this
court
respecting
solicitation
that
they
have
made
that
kind
of
a
distinction
that
they
have
dealt
with
whole
unitary
action
known
as
solicitation
that
is
the
use
of
speech
in
communication
to
advice
and
there
upon
obtain
retainer
agreement.
so
i
think
there
can
be
no
constitutional
distinction
between
those
two
elements.
now
that
leads
me
directly
to
the
first
amendment
implications
of
these
acts
of
solicitation
as
i
have
described
them.
there
are
two
lines
of
cases
that
i
think
justify
the
conclusion
that
this
is
protected
activity.
the
first
line
of
cases
of
course
starts
with
naacp
versus
button,
and
indeed
this
court
held
in
button
that
solicitation
is
not
wholly
outside
the
area
of
freedom
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
that
first
amendment
cannot
be
ignored
under
the
guys
(ph)
of
prohibiting
professional
misconduct.
now
that
is
almost
the
complete
answer
to
this
constitutional
question
posed
to
you
in
this
case.
there
has
to
be,
under
that
formulation
of
constitutional
doctrine
in
the
button
case,
there
has
to
be
an
area
of
freedom
to
solicit.
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
those
are
the
next
cases
perhaps
that
you
have
already
granted
that
kind
of
freedom,
say,
to
the
pharmacist
in
the
virginia
pharmacy
case.
you
have
granted
this
kind
of
freedom
to
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
advertising,
but
you
had
face
to
face
solicitation
in
the
cases
subsequent
to
button
involving
various
unions,
the
united
mine
workers,
united
transportation
workers,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
cases.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
but
there
was
face
to
face
solicitation
by
union
agents.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course
they
were
your
honor
but
they
also
said,
involved
the
actions
of
individual
attorneys
who
were
in
agreement
or
had
contracts
with
the
union
to
accept
the
results
of
this
solicitation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
oh
no,
not
at
all.
i
recognize
that
there
is
--
those
were
organizational
cases,
but
i
say
there
is
no
provision
or
concept
within
the
first
amendment
that
would
give
an
organization
greater
first
amendment
right
to
solicit
than
an
individual
attorney.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
in
one
of
these
cases,
i
think
it
was
the
united
mine
workers
case,
and
the
court
was
dealing
in
all
of
these
case
both
with
the
organization
and
with
the
individual
attorneys,
some
of
whom
had
been
charged,
i
assume,
with
the
violations
of
the
professional
code
of
ethics,
but
in
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
at
337
u.s.
at
page
8,
the
court
made
this
rather
significant
comment
-
and
this
was
a
unanimous
opinion
as
i
recall,
mr.
justice
black
writing
that
“lawyers
accepting
employment
is
where
retainer
agreements
that
had
been
solicited,
accepting
employment
under
this
constitutionally
protected
plan,
have
a
like
protection
which
the
state
cannot
abridge.”
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
was
there
indicating
that
there
was
the
area
of
first
amendment
freedom
to
solicit
that
the
state
cannot
protect.
now
i
would
be
relace
if
i
did
not
i
mention
of
course,
the
other
line
of
cases,
that
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
indeed
a
protected
area
within
the
first
amendment,
and
those
are
cases,
of
course,
primarily
are
the
virginia
pharmacy
case
and
the
bates
decision.
and
what
is
significant
about
these
notions
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated,
the
attempted
justifications
for
the
ban
on
solicitation
all
relate
to
projected
fear
that
there
is
something
inherently
going
to
and
inescapably
going
to
happen
when
the
lawyer
confronts
a
prospective
client
that,
that
lawyer
can
not
be
trusted
to
do
anything
other
than
to
misrepresent.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
of
course
not
the
subject
of
any
determination
or
finding
or
charge.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
case
arose.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
not,
for
one
minute,
suggesting
that
reasonably
drawn
rules
might
be
drafted
controlling
the
time,
place
and
manner
in
which
solicitations
may
be
made.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
could
well
be.
i
would
suggest
that
you
might
require
that
the
contract
itself
be
filed
in
court
or
with
the
bar
agreements.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right
that
there
would
be
rigid
controls.
now
i
understand
strong
arguments
have
made
that
it
is
impossible
to
control
or
supervise
oral
solicitations
that
may
be
a
far
removed
from
any.
well
that
is
always
been
true.
we
have
had
this
ban
on
solicitations;
we
have
had
the
ban
on
advertising.
we
never
know
about
it,
we
never
enforce
it
until
a
complaint,
until
some
evil
ensues
that
makes
it
evident
and
makes
it
possible
therefore
to
enforce
and
so
in
this
case.
the
prime
concept,
an
idea,
i
want
to
leave
with
this
court
is
that
it
is
constitutionally
insufficient
with
respect
to
restricting
the
first
amendment
to
freedom
recognized
in
the
button
case
to
say,
well,
this
is
so
likely
to
produce
this
representation,
contrary
interests,
deceived,
fraud
or
whatever
else
may
be
conceived
of.
i
do
not
believe
that
first
amendment
can
be
swept
aside
with
articulated
but
unfounded
fears
in
the
abstract
situation,
the
abstract
constitutional
situation
that
we
are
speaking
of.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
with
properly
drawn
rules,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
those
situations
may
have
developed,
those
rules
may
have
developed
out
of
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
your
honor,
that
may
be
the
difference,
one
of
the
major
differences
that
those
some
of
the
--
may
every
other
aspect
of
the
professional
code
relates
to
what
you
might
call
"malum
in
se",
something
that
is
inherently
wrong,
something
that
inherently
justifies
the
imposition
of
the
state’s
interest.
now
i
suggest
that
state’s
interest,
however,
cannot
be
grounded
on
speculation
and
fear,
because
we
have
had
adequate
rules
and
adequate,
and
if
need
be
we
can
add
more
rules
to
take
care
of
each
of
these
anticipated
fears,
that
can
arise
from
the
solicitation
concept.
thank
you
your
honor.
