justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gressman,
let
me
interrupt
you,
your
reference
to
the
highest
tradition
of
profession
makes
me
pause
just
a
minute.
would
it
be
in
the
highest
tradition
of
the
profession
for
prosecutor
to
give
legal
to
criminal
defendant
freely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
see
some
problem
about
a
prosecutor
acting
as
counsel
for
the
man
he
is
prosecuting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
suppose
the
thing
you
trying
to
avoid
is
the
counsel’s
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
don’t
you
see
a
conflict
of
interest
between
an
unemployed
lawyer
volunteering
a
free
legal
advice
about
the
merits
of
the
case
to
which
--
purportedly
in
the
interest
of
the
client,
when
he
is
also
acting
as
own
self
interest
to
try
an
persuade
the
client
to
employ
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn’t
that
the
underlying
reason
why
the
lawyer
should
not
mix
up
his
own
self
interest
by
giving
advice
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
disinterested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gressman
that
is
not
quite
right,
is
it?
the
exception
is
from
104
(a)
not
103.
there
is
no
exception
at
103.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
distinction
between
the
two
canons
in
mind
the
former
prohibiting
speech
and
the
second
prohibiting
acceptance
of
the
employment
which
one
might
describe
as
conduct
rather
than
speech.
assume
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
speech
but
not
agree
with
you
as
to
the
acceptance
of
the
employment
after
having
given
unsolicited
advice.
what
should
we
do
with
the
case?
assume
we
thought
you
are
right
about
canon
103
but
wrong
about
canon
104,
what
would
be
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
you
could
say
the
speech
is
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
proper
to
prohibit
the
conduct
of
accepting
employment
after
giving
an
unsolicited
advice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
clearly
speech
than
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
we
disagree
with
you,
just
for
a
moment
and
we
thought
the
former
was
protected
speech,
the
later
was
unprotected
conduct,
what
in
your
view
would
be
the
proper
way
to
dispose
at
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
welch,
that
statement
i
guess
is
there
is
a
public
record
of
the
suit
being
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
public
show
that
he
appeared
pro
se
or
did
someone
else
represent
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
right,
but
is
it
conceivable
that
some
lawyer
went
ahead
and
filed
the
suit
without
being
aware
of
the
testimony,
do
we
know?
had
it
been
prepared
in
advance
or
there
is
some
failure
of
communication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
that
suit
was
happened
other
than
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
the
public
records
tell
us
whether
anything
happened
beyond
the
filing
of
the
complaint
itself
on
the
following
(inaudible).
justice
john
paul
stevens
counter
suit
against
mr.
o’reilly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
the
claim
was
filed
by
ohralik.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
ohralik,
i
am
sorry,
i
thought
you
said
o’reilly
and
i
thought
somebody
else.
