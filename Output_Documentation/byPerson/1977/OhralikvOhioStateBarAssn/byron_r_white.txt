justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
charge
require
proof
of
advice
with
respect
to
need
for
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
just
is
not
the
business
of
soliciting
business,
it
also
says
you
should
have
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
need
and
then
recommending
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
not
that
does
not
reach
the
canons
of
ethics
if
he
does
not
charge,
does
it?m
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
know
why
we
have
to
say,
have
to
deny
what
the
state
claims
that
either
bases
or
its
rule.
they
are
talking
about
etiquette;
they
claimed
that
there
are
some
substantial
answer
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not
deny
those,
do
you?
you
just
say
that
they
are
insufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
the
origin
but
the
state
does
not
--
it
does
not
say
now
that
there
is
any
matter
of
etiquette
it
is
just
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
a
matter
of
etiquette
when
the
state
says
this
rule
is,
one
of
the
things
this
rule
is
designed
to
do
is
prevent
overreaching
and
under
influence
by
--
now
that
is
not
etiquette.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
real.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
but
they
are
real
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
state
can
prevent
a
lawyer
from
financing
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
is
purely
prophylactic.
why
should
not
that
have
to
proof
actual
fraud
or
misrepresentation
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
etiquette,
is
it?
