justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
this
record
indicates
the
tape
recorder
that
were
used
by
your
client
without
divulging
to
these
two
young
ladies
that
they
were
being
used.
does
that
suggest
you
the
danger
of
overreaching
in
this
sort
of
activity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
concede
a
state
interest
in
protecting
unsophisticated
people
overreaching
by
members
of
bar,
i
assume.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
second
case
involving
solicitation
by
a
lawyer
is
76-1650,
ohralik
against
the
ohio
state
bar
association.
it
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
solicitation
in
this
case
is
quite
different
from
that
i
have
just
described
in
primus.
the
appellant,
an
ohio
lawyer,
professionally
solicited
two
young
women
who
had
been
injured
and
hospitalized
following
an
automobile
accident.
he
approached
one
in
the
hospital
room
while
she
was
in
traction.
he
solicited
the
other
at
her
home
the
day
after
she
left
the
hospital.
he
advised
both
of
them
that
they
had
good
claims
for
damages
and
offered
to
represent
to
each
of
them
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
of
one-third
of
any
recovery.
the
young
women
separately
agreed
to
the
tender
representation,
but
thereafter
sought
to
discharge
appellant.
but
he
resisted,
they
file
complaints
with
the
local
bar
grievance
committee.
after
due
proceedings
and
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
appellant
was
found
guilty
of
violating
the
disciplinary
rules
against
solicitation.
the
court
rejected
appellant's
reliance
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
in
bates
against
the
state
bar
of
arizona,
decided
last
term,
the
court
held
that
lawyers
could
not
be
disciplined
for
truthfully
advertising
the
availability
of
routine
legal
services.
such
advertisement
were
viewed
as
commercial
speech,
entitled
to
a
measure
of
constitutional
protection.
the
court
reserved
the
question
in
that
case
as
to
the
right
of
a
state
to
discipline
lawyers
for
in-person
commercial
solicitation.
the
state
has
a
strong
interest
in
protecting
the
public
from
the
aspects
of
solicitation
that
potentially
involved
fraud,
undue
influence,
overreaching,
and
other
forms
of
vexatious
conduct.
as
appellant
solicited
employment
for
pecuniary
gain
under
circumstances
likely
to
result
in
these
evils,
we
hold
that
the
state
interest
out
ways
the
first
amendment
interest.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
justice
marshall
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
rehnquist
concurred
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
