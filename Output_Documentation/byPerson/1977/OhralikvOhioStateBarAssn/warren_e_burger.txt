we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
1650,
ohralik
against
the
ohio
state
bar
association.
mr.
gressman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
counsel
it
would
be
fundamentally
any
different
if
a
physician
observing
some
person
stranger
to
him
thought
he
detected
symptoms
of
diabetes
or
any
other
disease
superficial
symptoms
and
then
solicited
the
person
to
come
to
his
office
for
an
examination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
this
is
done
to
some
extent
in
various
areas,
it
would
be
at
least
indicated
by
the
fact
that
hospitals
have
committees
of
surgeons
to
monitor
surgery
to
see
whether
unnecessary
surgery
is
being
performed,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
not
by
a
person
who
is
going
to
profit
by
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
referring
to
the
life
insurance
companies
who
have
institutional
ads
suggesting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn’t
the
fundamental
difference
in
these
hypotheticals
the
manner
in
which
the
relationship
began,
in
the
one
case
the
client
has
gone
to
the
lawyer
and
solicit
his
advice
and
the
other
lawyer
has
gone
to
the
client
and
volunteered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
the
same
rules
of
solicitation
apply
to
solicitors
in
england?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
inherited
but
they
have
no
connection
with
the
inns
of
the
court.
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
a
lawyer
who
is
trained
as
an
advocate
or
presumable
trained
as
an
advocate
dealing
with
a
layperson
in
the
hospital
or
in
sick
bed
or
whatever
is
engaged
in
an
arm’s
length
transaction
where
the
too
far
this
person
being
solicited
than
the
person
doing
the
soliciting
or
on
the
same
parity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
much
more
skill
that
persuading,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
he
is
not
overreaching
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
submission
would
necessarily
apply
to
every
profession,
would
it
not?
we
could
not
grant
this
freedom
of
speech
to
lawyers
and
deny
it
to
doctors
and
dentists
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
face
to
face
solicitation
and
not
was
advertising.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
limited
to
the
members
of
the
organization.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
that
include
a
requirement
that
the
client
have
counseled
for
any
agreements
of
the
employment
resigned,
separate
independent
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
something
like
importing
the
miranda
concept
into
the
civil
employment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
gressman.
mr.
welch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
both
the
conversations
that
is
in
the
hospital
and
in
the
home
tape
recorded
or
just
the
one
in
the
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
soliciting
lawyer
had
used
as
some
of
them
traditionally
have
photostatic
copies
of
checks
and
prior
settlements
they
had
made
for
other
clients
and
perhaps
testimonial
letters
from
clients.
would
that
under
ohio
practice
be
the
subject
of
the
special
finding
or
would
that
simply
be
regarded
as
evidence
in
support
of
the
general
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
state
of
ohio
give
rule
making
power,
the
legislature
or
the
constitution
to
the
supreme
court,
about
57
or
58?

that
was
filed
after
the
hearing
on
the
disciplinary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
disciplinary
hearing
did
he
represent
that
he
was
going
to
forgo
his
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
testimony
under
oath
or
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
