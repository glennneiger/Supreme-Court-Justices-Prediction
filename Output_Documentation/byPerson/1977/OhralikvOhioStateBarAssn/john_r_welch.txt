mr.
john
r.
welch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
a
question
of
the
matter
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
there
are
some
misimpressions
that
may
began
from
what
it
said
in
the
briefs.
first,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
sole
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
to
what
are
the
facts
in
a
disciplinary
matter
and
what
the
discipline
should
be.
when
a
complaint
is
filed
against
an
attorney
such
as
mr.
ohralik,
it
is
heard
by
a
board
of
commissioners,
a
panel
of
three
of
the
board
of
commissioners.
and
they
made
findings
of
fact
and
sent
it
on
to
the
full
board
of
commissioners
who
themselves
review
the
record
and
make
findings
of
fact
and
recommendations
to
the
supreme
court.
after
that
proceeding
is
finished
that
they
lose
jurisdiction.
what
they
find
as
fact
and
what
they
recommend
has
no
varying
whatsoever
from
thereon.
it
is
for
the
guidance
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
of
course,
but
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
i
repeat
has,
sole
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
to
what
the
findings
of
fact
are
and
as
to
what
the
discipline
should
be.
so
where
it
is
referred
to
in
the
brief
that
the
-
in
appellant's
brief
-
that
the
board
of
commissioners
made
certain
findings
with
respect
to
the
relinquishment
of
the
contracts.
they
found
that
that
was
not
unethical
for
appellant
to
claim
to
his
contracts;
there
was
no
finding
on
that
matter
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
john
r.
welch
they
are
appointed
by
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
there
are
17
districts,
and
one
member
is
appointed
from
each
district
and
they
rotate
the
court
as
to
who
will
appoint
the
next
member,
one
by
one.
mr.
john
r.
welch
the
ohio
state
bar
association
was
the
charging
party.
we
brought
the
charges
against
the
mr.
ohralik
and
i
think
it
is
worthy
of
repeating
that
we
charged
him
within
hospital
solicitation.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
charge
of
the
young
one
woman,
and
the
other
young
woman
was
charged
with
solicit
--
he
was
charged
with
soliciting
the
other
young
woman
in
her
home.
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
found
as
fact
that
those
solicitations
did
occur
where
it
was
alleged
and
they
found
other
facts
in
addition
to
those.
mr.
john
r.
welch
they
are
agents
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
yes
your
honor
and
had
no
connection
with
the
ohio
state
bar
association
whatsoever.
mr.
john
r.
welch
just
the
one
in
the
home
of
wanda
lou
holbert
was
tape
recorded,
she
was
the
second
young
women,
but
the
other
tape
recording
was
made
with
the
parents
of
carol
mcclintock
on
the
same
day
on
which
the
appellant
solicited
carol
mcclintock
in
the
hospital.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
not
refer
to
that
tape
recording
at
all.
it
was
submitted
as
evidence
and
the
decision
of
the
court
makes
no
mention
of
the
second
or
the
one
with
the
parents
of
carol
mcclintock.
it
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
that
tape
recording.
appellee
--
we
would
like
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
in
speaking
to
the
due
process
matter
that
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
we
in
no
way
intended
to
transform
the
charges
against
the
appellant
in
this
court,
i.e.
we
do
not
intend
to
allege
new
charges,
no
question,
but
that
he
was
disciplined
in
the
court
below
for
violation
of
the
two
disciplinary
rules
cited
by
the
court,
and
it
was
soliciting
and
obtaining
agreements
to
represent
the
two
young
women.
however,
the
court,
as
i
have
indicated,
made
findings
of
fact
that
are
incorporated
in
their
decision.
they
do
not
operate
in
a
vacuum.
the
charges
were
made
at
the
hospital
--
the
solicitation
was
made
in
the
hospital
and
the
court
has
found.
mr.
john
r.
welch
in
ohio
there
is.
the
general
assembly
of
ohio
has
spoken
for
many
years
that
solicitation
by
an
attorney
such
as
mr.
ohralik
is
against
public
policy?
mr.
john
r.
welch
not
within
my
knowledge?
mr.
john
r.
welch
the
two
are
really
tied
together.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes.
the
ohio
state
bar
association
your
honor,
to
answer
that
question,
never
makes
a
charge
of
criminal
solicitation.
that
rather
brings
disciplinary
actions.
we
do
not,
and
as
i
said,
intend
to
transform
these
charges
against
the
appellant.
we
have
no
intention
whatsoever.
mr.
john
r.
welch
it
would
be
my
judgment
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
would
be
incorporated
in
the
general
allegation
that
it
would
be
evidence
of
how
he
solicited,
the
manner
in
what
he
did.
this
is
the
same
as
in
this
case
is
indicated
by
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
they
made
a
number
of
findings
that
would
not
be
specifically
charged
in
the
complaint,
but
the
evidence
indicates
that
these
things
did
occur
such
as
a
suit
after
against
carol
mcclintock
after
the
solicitation
had
occurred.
the
court
makes
a
specific
finding
on
that.
and
it
makes
specific
findings
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
wanda
lou
holbert
discharged
the
appellant
after
she
had
time
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
overnight
and
had
a
talk
with
her
mother
about
it.
that
is
after
the
solicitation
so
of
course
is
our
position
and
that
is
incorporated
in
the
general
charge
although
the
charge
is
specific
as
to
time
and
place.
in
essence,
appellant
is
arguing
here,
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
understand
his
brief,
that
there
is
need
for
some
state
regulation
of
a
lawyer.
nevertheless
he
says
that
the
ohio
rules
are
overbroad
and
inhibit
objectionable
as
well
as
unobjectionable
conduct.
he
also
argues
that
appellant's
conduct
was
unobjectionable,
innocent,
pure,
benign
perhaps
other
labels
he
puts
on
the
conduct.
however,
it
is
--
he
also
argues
that
there
is
no
harm
done
to
the
clients
in
this
case
and
that
there
is
no
stated
compelling
interest
by
the
court
below.
it
is
our
position
that
the
record
plainly
demonstrates
that
the
appellant's
conduct
poses
precisely
the
dangers
that
support
the
ohio
rules.
it
is
clear,
we
believe,
we
submit,
that
the
purpose
of
the
disciplinary
rules
dr2-103(a)
and
dr2-104(a)
are
to
eliminate
or
at
least
to
reduce,
to
the
greatest
extent
possible,
the
injury
to
potential
clients
that
is
caused
by
solicitation.
in
other
words,
the
rules
have,
as
a
purpose,
the
protection
of
the
public
from
the
harm
and
the
dangers
of
harm
flow
from
commercial
solicitation.
furthermore,
it
is,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
public
policy
of
ohio's
expressed
through
as
general
assembly
that
commercial
solicitation
is
prohibited.
secondly,
even
if
we
--
if
there
are
some
conceivable
situations
that
the
rules
challenged
by
appellant
maybe
deemed
to
be
overbroad,
the
appellant
should
not
be
permitted
to
evade
himself
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
as
expressed
in
bates
to
secure
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
in
bates,
this
court
held
that
the
justification
for
the
overbreadth
analysis
applies
weekly,
if
at
all,
in
the
ordinary
commercial
context
and
the
client
to
apply
it
to
professional
advertising.
a
context
where
the
court
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
further
its
intended
objective.
the
court
said
since
advertising
is
linked
to
commercial
well
being,
it
seem
unlikely
that
such
speech
is
particularly
susceptible
to
be
in
crushed
by
overbroad
regulations,
and
since
solicitation
is
similarly
linked
to
commercial
well
being
and
is
a
practice
that
is
no
more
deserving
a
first
amendment
protection
than
commercial
advertising.
we
submit
that
the
appellant
should
not
be
able
to
evade
himself
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
welch
not
by
the
legislature
but
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
the
constitution
of
ohio,
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
constitution
of
ohio
mandates,
it
gives
that
responsibility
for
admissions
and
discipline
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
john
r.
welch
explicitly
confirms
that
authority,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
welch
on
the
matter
of
solicitation?
mr.
john
r.
welch
there
are
some
statutes
that
deal
with
other
matters
involving
the
court
and
may
--
there
is
one
involving
judges
your
honor,
yes
sir,
where
the
legislature
did
pass
laws
asking
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
promulgate
rules
for
inquiries
about
the
competency
and
so
forth
of
judges,
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
promulgated
separate
rules
covering
that
subject.
mr.
john
r.
welch
not
effecting
--
mr.
john
r.
welch
there
is
yes
your
honor.
there
are
laws
still
on
the
book
which
the
court
--
i
believe
it
is
47
chapter
47
ohio
revise
code
they
are
still
on
the
books
that
were
on
the
books
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
was
given
constitutional
authority
to
control
over
admission
and
discipline
and
they
have
just
remained
on
the
books.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes,
yes
i
think
they
are
merely
in
aid
of
that
i
think
quite
the
court
expresses
it
now
if
the
court
wishes
to
consult
them,
but
we
never
bring
any
charges
based
upon
the
statutes,
it
is
strictly
--
mr.
john
r.
welch
always
under
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
mr.
john
r.
welch
it
was
promulgated
october
5,
1970,
and
the
rules,
at
here
under
consideration,
were
then
promulgated.
mr.
john
r.
welch
became
effective
october
5.
mr.
john
r.
welch
there
are
modeled
on
those.
then
there
are
other
instances
not
pertinent
here
where
we
have
the
ohio
code
is
not
the
same
as
the
american
bar
association
code.
mr.
john
r.
welch
these
are
identical
with
the
american
bar
association
rules,
at
least
at
the
time
when
this
occurred.
mr.
john
r.
welch
it
is
more
recent
than
that
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
supreme
court,
the
ohio
constitution
was
amended
giving
this
power
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
late
60â€™s,
perhaps
it
is
late
as
68.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes,
yes
your
honor,
and
the
control
over
admissions
and
discipline
of
lawyers.
there
is
one
other
matter
that
is
brought
to
the
court's
attention
which
we
do
not
apologize
but
we
recognize
that
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
rule,
the
record
of
this
case
and
has
to
do
with
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
court
below
as
to
the
testimony
of
the
appellant
in
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below,
testimony
of
appellant
that
he
would
abandon
his
claim
for
compensation
or
for
attorney
fees
against
wanda
lou
holbert.
he
did
so
testify
and
the
court
below
made
a
finding
fact
that
he,
the
appellant
testified
to
that
effect.
that
is
not
true.
had
it
not
been
twice
stated
in
the
appellant's
brief
that
is
his
jurisdiction
of
statement
and
in
his
main
brief,
that
testimony
of
the
appellant.
we
would
not
have
made
any
statement
about
it
whatsoever,
but
it
is
important
we
think
for
the
court
to
note
in
considering
the
first
amendment
argument
made
here
that
he
did,
the
appellant
did
sue
wanda
lou
holbert
four
days
after
he
had
testified
that
he
would
not
sue
her
or
he
would
abandon
his
claim
against
her,
only
two
business
days
as
matter
of
fact,
the
hearing
concluded
on
thursday
and
there
was
a
friday
and
the
suit
was
filed
the
next
monday.
we
think
that
candor
on
this
matter
should
have
been
impelled
the
appellant
to
disclose
in
his
briefs
that
this
suit
was
filed.
mr.
john
r.
welch
it
was
filed
after
the
hearing,
the
disciplinary
hearing
concluded.
mr.
john
r.
welch
he
did,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
he
did.
mr.
john
r.
welch
under
oath.
mr.
john
r.
welch
there
is,
there
is.
mr.
john
r.
welch
he
was
represented
--
mr.
john
r.
welch
we
do
not
have
that
knowledge.
i
would
say
that
it
is
my
recollection
that
he
did
have
an
attorney.
mr.
john
r.
welch
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
understand.
mr.
john
r.
welch
yes
they
do,
there
was
--
wanda
lou
holbert
obtained
an
attorney
and
fought
a
counterclaim
against
mr.
ohralik.
that
suit
did
pen
up
until
the
time
these
proceedings
began
in
this
court.
mr.
john
r.
welch
mr.
ohralik,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
welch
it
was
your
honor,
ohralik
sued
wanda
lou
holbert.
mr.
john
r.
welch
the
appellant.
on
this
record
the
appellant
has
failed
to
demonstrate
that
his
conduct
is
entirely
the
first
amendment
protection.
his
commercials
solicitation
with
the
two
young
women
served
his
interest,
not
their
interest,
and
his
conduct
was
such
as
to
harm
them
rather
than
to
help
them.
we
believe
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
that
type
of
conduct
and
protecting
the
citizens
of
ohio
from
such
solicitation.
that
is
all
i
have
at
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
