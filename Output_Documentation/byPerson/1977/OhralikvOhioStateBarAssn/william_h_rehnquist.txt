rehnquist
wouldn’t
the
consultation
itself
and
mr.
justice
stevens’
hypothetical
be
paid
for,
so
that
the
lawyer
is
not
having
to
seek
gain
only
by
further
employment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
that
the
custom
of
the
profession,
you
do
not
just
walk
into
a
lawyer’s
office
and
say
i
have
got
a
problem
and
after
you
tell
me
what
my
problem
is
and
what
i
should
do
about
it
maybe
i
will
decide
to
retain.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren’t
those
freedom
of
association
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
claim
your
client
is
relying
on
only
the
freedom
of
association
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
dissenters
in
those
cases
thought
so
too,
i
think.
