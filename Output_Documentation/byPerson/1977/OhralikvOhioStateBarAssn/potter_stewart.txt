justice
potter
stewart
because
barristers
in
england
--
maybe
it
has
not
always
been
so,
but
as
i
understand
it,
do
not
communicate
with
clients
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
entirely
different
setting
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
here
there
is
a
relationship
between
a
lawyer
and
a
client
and
a
barrister
in
england
does
not
have
any
relationship
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
directly
between
himself
and
the
client,
but,
only
with
a
solicitor.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
just
never
do.
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
the
commissioners
appointed?
justice
potter
stewart
this,
the
appellee
and
your
client,
is
in
this
case
is
the
ohio
state
bar
association
which
was
what
the
charging
party?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
commissioners
are
agents
and
officers
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
rather
than
of
the
ohio
state
bar
association.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
welch
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
you
spoke
a
few
moments
ago
of
the
ohio
state
legislature
and
its
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
my
understanding
is,
and
you
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken,
that
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
in
ohio
was
promulgated
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
the
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
constitution
explicitly
confers
that
authority
under
supreme
court,
ohio
supreme
court.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
state
statutes
bearing
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
either
on
the
matter
of
authorizing
the
court
to
do
it
or
substantively
on
the
matter
of
solicitation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
no
state
laws
by
that;
i
mean
enacted
by
the
state
legislature
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
bearing
directly
or
effecting
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
generally
understood
in
ohio
that
the
supreme
court's
action
have
superseded
those
old
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
always
the
code
of
professional
responsibility.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
was
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
where--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
modeled
on
with
some
modifications
on
the
roles
proposed
by
the
american
bar
association
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
but
these
are
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
rules
of
civil
and
criminal
procedure?
