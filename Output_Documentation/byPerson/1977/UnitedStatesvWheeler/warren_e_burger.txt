e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
1629
united
states
against
wheeler.
mr.
urbanczyk
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
power
which
the
tribe
did
not
possess
before.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
just
said
in
a
few.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
navajo
tribe
was
existent
for
more
than
200
years,
hasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
200
years
ago
it
was
totally
sovereign,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably
had
some
method
of
dealing
with
violators
of
there
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
why
you
used
the
term
residual
sovereignty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o'
clock.
mr.
o'toole
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
have
much
to
do
with
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
agree,
it
is
historically
true
that
there
has
been
pervasive
control
in
many
many
respects
but
it
does
not
really
go
to
the
heart
of
jurisdiction,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not
sovereign
or
like
the
federal
government
or
like
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
have
any
residual
sovereignty,
does
it?
the
territory
has
no
residual
sovereignty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sovereignty
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
fact
that
this
indian
tribe
has
distinguished
from
perhaps
some
others,
but
specifically
this
one,
it
is
exercised
in
sovereign
power
over
its
own
members.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
criminal
affairs
which
suggests
that
there
is
a
residuals
sovereignty
there
recognized
by
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
should
think
that
could
the
speak
would
be
read
as
once
totally
sovereign
other
than
formerly
sovereign.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
not
be
correct
to
say
that
the
tribe
has
all
the
sovereignty,
that
they
originally
had,
except
that
which
was
taken
away
from
them
by
writ
of
conquests
by
the
whites?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
cannot
that
be
read
as
meaning
such
sovereignty
as
the
congress
has
allowed
them
to
retain?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
justice
marshall
suggested
they
have
enough
sovereignty
to
substitute
some
of
their
people
for
some
of
their
clients.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
time
is
up
but
we
used
a
little
of
the
--
we
will
give
you
two
more
minutes
if
you
have
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
o’toole
if
you
lose
this
case
what
effect
if
any
would
have
on
the
navajo
judicial
structure
in
this
operation,
in
your
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
urbanczyk
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
wheeler
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
