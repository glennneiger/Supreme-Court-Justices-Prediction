unknown
speaker
mr.
urbanczyk,
would
it
impair
your
argument
in
any
way
if
we
were
to
decide
in
this
squamish
case,
a
case
that
was
argued
earlier
this
week
that
the
indian
tribal
right
to
prosecute
is
dependent
upon
an
affirmative
grant
from
congress.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
suggest,
do
you
that
cannot
find
statutory
authority
in
any
act
or
in
any
treaty
that
gives
a
tribe
an
incremental
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
you
could,
let
us
assume
you
could
find
either
exposed
or
implied
in
some
federal
statute,
tribal
power
prosecute
for
some
kinds
of
crimes.
unknown
speaker
and
not
only
and
expressly
in
a
statute
that
the
tribes
did
have
certain
kinds
of
criminal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
nonetheless
it
is
a
federal
statute
it
says
that.
unknown
speaker
express
or
implied
and
he
says
the
tribes
may
do
so
and
so
but
they
may
do
not
something
else.
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
part
of
there
own
tribal
self
government.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wheeler
is
a
member
of
the
tribe,
there
is
no
question
on
that.
unknown
speaker
although,
as
the
tribal
court
clearly
had
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
involved
here
with
public
law
280.
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
not
the
area
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
between
the
major
crimes
and
the
tribal
crimes?
unknown
speaker
does
the
indian
civil
rights
act
protect
against
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
in
what
case
did
we
recognize
the
territories
had
powers
just
like
indian
tribes,
if
that
way
jurisdiction
--
unknown
speaker
but
no
one
denies
that
the
territories
and
their
courts
are
creatures
of
federal
statute
do
they?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
that
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
with
respect
to
whether
indian
tribal
sovereignty
in
all
its
aspects
is
a
creature
of
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
specific
federal
statute
that
you
can
point
to
that
authorized
the
whole
nation
to
adopt
its
tribal
code?
unknown
speaker
that
was
human
accident.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
they
just
recognized
the
tribal,
what
authority
did
the
tribe
had
to
provide
some
criminal
lawyer
for
indians
or
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
--
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
find
out
--
where
was
it
delegated--
unknown
speaker
well,
he
did
not
issue
these
tribal
codes
--
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
just
approved,
they
just
could
not
become
effective
without
his
approval.
unknown
speaker
that
is
different,
that
is
something
else
--
and
they
need
to
exercise
it
but
suppose
they
could
displace
any
tribal
code
but
they
have
not,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
that
is
fine
but
i
would
still
like
to
know
the
source
of
the
tribes
authority
to
issue
this
code.
you
denied
that
it
was
some
aspect
of
any
residuals
sovereignty
in
the
tribe
--.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say
allowing
them
sovereignty?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know
why
do
you
say
that?
because
you
have
referred
several
times
to
the
right
of
self
government,
i
would
have
thought
the
right
of
self
government
which
i
took
that
you
conceded
would
include
the
punishment
by
the
tribe
of
one
of
its
own
members.
unknown
speaker
mr.
o'toole,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
situation
immediately
before
the
1968
statute
was
passed,
i
asked
the
same
question
to
your
opponent
but
i
would
like
your
views.
was
it
permissible
in
1967
for
a
tribe,
a
tribal
member
twice
for
the
same
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
where
does,
how
does,
where
did
the
constitutional
right
come
from
that
you
are
asserting
today?
if
there
was
no
constitutional
right
for
that
identity
of
offenses
in
1967
when
did
the
constitution
change?
unknown
speaker
yes,
by
the
tribal
court
or
the
member
of
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
concede
that
there
was
no
constitutional
objection
to
that
you
have
to
be
conceding
that,
that
kind
of
prosecution
was
not
for
an
offense
against
the
united
states
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
an
offense
against
the
united
states
in
1967,
how
could
it
be
today?
well,
i
cannot
go
so
far
as
to
make
that
contention
your
honor
there
is
lot
to
my
knowledge
of
any
cases
that
deal
with
that
issue.
what
about
talton
against
mayes?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
if
he
had
been
further
prosecuted
by
the
federal
government
or
under
its
auspices,
as
you
contend
your
client
was
here
in
the
tribal
court
surely
he
would
have
had
that
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
or
did
not
the
court
expressly
said
thought
that
the
offense
there
was
not
an
offense
against
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
i
was
saying
that
that
is
what
the
court
said
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
we
accepted
that
statement.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
we
accepted
it
--
you
are
rather
in
here
in
big
trouble
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
o'toole,
were
you
here
on
monday
to
hear
the
argument
in
the
oliphant
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
we
must
decide
this
case
and
that
one
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
shoe
can
pinch
the
other
way,
can
it
too,
because
in
this
case
you
have
an
indian
tribe
trying
a
member
of
the
tribe
under
the
judicial
self-government
law
and
in
all
of
them
you
have
the
indian
tribe
trying
a
non-indian.
now
you
have
residual
sovereignty
for
one
purpose
but
not
another.
unknown
speaker
mr.
o'toole
i
may
already
have
asked
it
but
i
have
got
this
--
kind
of
pre-occupied
with
one
thought
on
it
and
i
would
like
to
put
it
on
the
table
so
you
can
discuss
it
fully
and
find
out
where
i
am
wrong,
seems
to
me
that
if
prior
to
the
1968
civil
rights
act,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
a
tribal
member
could
have
been
tried
twice
by
the
tribe
for
the
same
violation
of
the
tribal
code
that
necessarily
that
a
violation
of
the
tribal
court
by
tribal
member
was
not
an
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
if
that
was
true
then
i
would
think
it
is
still
true
now.
what
is
wrong
with
that
analysis?
the
issue
is
really
not
of
sovereignty
but
whether
or
not
the
violation
by
the
member
of
the
tribe
of
the
tribal
court
is
an
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
if
they
could
be
tried
twice
in
1965
or
which
i
guess
they
could
because
congress
had
to
pass
this
provision,
it
must
have
been
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
not
an
offense.
unknown
speaker
but
that
does
not
amend
the
constitution
--
unknown
speaker
it
recognizes
that
we
needed
such
a
statute
to
protect
the
indian
from
that
particular
kind
of
abuse.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
act
only
talks
about
indians
in
exercising
their
power
of
self
government,
now
the
second
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
is
not
covered
by
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
unknown
speaker
may
be
there
is
something
wrong
with
it
but
that
is
the
way
the
case
seems
there
up
to
me
right
now.
unknown
speaker
is
not
my
brother
steven’s
right
that
the
premise
for
the
civil
rights
act
as
if
there
really
was
not
need
to
protect
people
subject
to
tribal
law?
unknown
speaker
the
criminal
proceedings
before
tribal
agencies
were
not
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
one
that
would
not
know
that
you
think
that
to
be
read
really
carefully
--
mayes.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
unnecessary.
unknown
speaker
mr.
o’toole
did
you
tell
us
that
the
seven
major
crimes
had
been
enacted
at
the
time
that
talton
was
indicted.
unknown
speaker
and
used
in
1893.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
have
no
explanation
as
to
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
navajo
court
system
assert
jurisdiction
over
a,
non
navajos
or
b,
non
indians.
unknown
speaker
mr.
urbanczyk
before
you
sit
down
can
you
tell
me
if
you
are
familiar
with
any
cases
discussing
the
question
whether
a
violation
of
the
tribal
code
by
a
tribal
member
is
an
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment?
