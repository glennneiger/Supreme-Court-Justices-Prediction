mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
wheeler
submits
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
when
it
held
that
successive
prosecutions
in
tribal
and
federal
court
are
barred
at
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
decision
is
correct
for
two
basic
reasons.
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
dual
sovereignty
exception
has
never
been
applied
outside
of
the
federal
and
state
arena
and
secondly
indian
tribes
are
in
no
way
sovereign
like
state
so
as
to
allow
the
application
of
this
exception
to
the
successive
tribal
and
federal
prosecutions.
additionally,
the
petitioners
claims
that
the
facts
of
the
respondents
case
call
for
the
application
of
other
already
recognized
exceptions,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
must
fail
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
support
the
application
of
any
of
these
exceptions.
before
going
any
further,
key
facts
must
be
noted.
these
facts
fully
support
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
claim
that
tribes
are
in
fact
arms
of
the
federal
sovereign.
from
the
arrest
of
the
respondent
wheeler
through
his
prosecution
in
the
district
court,
seven
months
later,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
which
is
a
federal
agency
was
in
direct
control
of
the
investigation.
before
the
respondent
was
charged
with
the
lesser
included
effect
of
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
the
minor,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
already
investigated
the
possible
violation
of
major
crimes
act
offenses.
in
fact,
the
pervasive
federal
influence
to
control
over
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
tribal
right
is
strikingly
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
crime
seen
was
in
the
compound
of
high
school
run
by
a
federal
agency,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor,
this
is
merely
an
example
of
the
pervasive
control
of
the
federal
government
over
all
aspects
of
tribal
life.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
i
submit
your
honor,
that
the
key
to
this
case
is
whether
indian
tribes
are
sovereign
like
states
in
the
federal
government
and
the
very
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
as
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
dual
sovereignty
exception,
never
has
been
applied
out
of
a
context
of
successive
state
and
federal
prosecutions.
in
fact
it
has
not
been
extended
to
the
territory
of
united
states
which
this
court
has
recognized
very
recently
as
being
exercising
powers
of
self
government,
similar
to
indian
tribes,
and
in
fact
exercising
these
powers
with
independence
much
greater
than
the
indian
tribes.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct,
it
emanates.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct,
it
emanates
from
a
grant
of
power
from
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
i
do
not
think
the
language
of
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court
has
said
that
but
the
language
of
this
court
in
puerto
rico
versus
the
shell
company
in
which
it
describes
the
local
powers
of
self
government
of
the
puerto
rico,
as
well
as
a
more
recent
language
in
the
forrest
v.
otero
(ph)
case
reflects
both
of
the
territorial
courts
have
substantial
powers
of
local
government.
in
fact,
i
think
the
court
characterized
the
territory
of
puerto
rico
as
state
like,
yet
the
doctrine
of
dual
sovereignty
has
not
been
extended
to
the
federal
territories.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
no,
i
do
not
contend
that
they
are
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
obviously
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
that
they
have
residual
sovereignty
which
preexisted
any
recognition
by
this
government.
however,
i
think
that
misses
the
point,
the
point
is
are
they
sovereign
like
states
so
as
to
exercise
powers
of
sovereignty,
independent
in
any
recognition
by
the
federal
government
and
in
fact,
i
dispute
the
very
contention,
the
petitioner
makes
that
the
tribes
did
have
a
residual
sovereignty
unless
they
were
first
recognized
and
allowed
to
exist
by
an
applicable
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
your
honor,
i
can
not
point
to
the
specific
statute
but
it
is
clear
that
this
was
the
case
and
i
believe
the
case
of
courier
or
i
believe
--
the
dodge
versus
nakai
case
which
i
cited
in
my
brief
recognizes
that
the
tribal
code
was
an
enacted
and
modeled
after
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
modeled
penal
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
the
tribal
court
your
honor
but
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
they
were
recognized
by
treaty
of
the
federal
government
as
existing.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
power
was
dealt
--
the
power
was
delegated
by
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor
i
can
not
point
to
the
specific
statute
but
i
would
submit
that
is
contained
in
title
25
and
the
general
language
of
title
25
giving
the
secretary
of
interior,
the
right
to
govern
and
manage
all
aspects
of
indian
life--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
under
his
authority
your
honor
i
believe
they
were
issued
and
approved.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct
and
necessarily
the
federal
government
has
as
the
government
concedes
complete
plenary
control
over
the
tribal
operations.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
various
legislative
enactments,
your
honor
historically
have
terminated
indian
tribes
and
that
is
reflected
by
the
statutes.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
your
honor
the
only
sovereignty
the
tribe
i
submit
was
the
treaty
which
the
tribe
engaged
in
1868
which
this
court
characterized
in
mcclanahan
as
less
than
an
arm's
length
agreement
between
the
equal
parties.
i
think
in
fact
historically
and
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
the
court
has
recognized
it
long
ago
over
a
century-and-a-half
ago
that
the
indian
tribes
were
subjected
to
session
conquest
and
by
the
federal
government
and
entered
in
to
treaties
and
agreements
to
enable
their
survival
and
existence.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
i
think
that.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor,
although
i
do
not
certainly
want
over
simplified,
i
think
the
use
of
the
phrase
sovereignty
as
this
court
recognized
in
mcclanahan
is
confusing
and
that
the
appropriate
method
of
determining
powers
of
self
government
is
by
examination
of
applicable
treaties,
statutes
and
laws
including
the
federal
regulations.
as
this
court
characterized
the
indian
tribes
in
the
recent
case
of
antelope
and
they
characterized
it
as
one
sovereign
necessarily
that
suggest
to
me
that
they
are
no
longer
sovereign.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
my
submission
your
honor,
yes
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
it
is
the
respondents
submission
that
the
criminal
law
was
a
exercise
of
the
congressional
plenary
control
over
tribes
allowing
them
criminal
jurisdiction
over
certain
areas.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
no,
i
would
not
concede
that.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
for
our
purposes
of
limited
powers
of
self
government
your
honor
and
i
would
analogize
them
to
the
powers
of
self
government
that
the
territory
of
the
puerto
rico
has
exercised
which
include
local
powers
of
prosecuting
criminal
matters.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
pardon.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
yes
there
is
a
supreme
court
of
the
navajo
tribe.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
yes
there
is,
it
is
very
structured
and
perhaps
the
most
up
to
date
and
complete
judicial
system
of
any
tribe
in
the
country.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
i
submit
is
a
correct
preposition.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
your
honor,
certainly
local
and
state
governments
have
the
power
to
put
people
in
jail
but
i
think
the
course
of
the
power
is
the
key
that
this
court
has
to
examine
to
determine
first
of
all
whether
they
have
even
residual
sovereignty,
let
alone
sovereignty.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
parden.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
the
power
of
self
government
your
honor
i
think
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
again
as
i
indicated
to
you
mr.
justice
white,
i
cannot
specifically
put
my
finger
on
the
statute,
although
i
believe
it
is
in
my
brief,
and
if
the
court
would
like
i
can
indicate
the
appropriate
statute
which
in
essence
says
that
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
without
quoting
it
your
honor
indicates
that
the
department
of
the
interior
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
the
power
to
control
tribal
courts,
law
and
order,
police,
judges
and
so
forth
and
necessarily
i
submit
the
regulations
in
25
cfr
which
exist.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
no,
your
honor
they
do
not,
the
judges
of
the
tribe
sit
on
the
cases
over
tribal
matters
but
i
submit
that
this
sitting
on
cases
is
because
this
power
has
been
granted
to
the
tribes
by
the
federal
government,
not
because
of
any
preexisting
and
unrecognized
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor
if
they
had
tribes
in
the
traditional
american
justice
systems
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
the
members
of
the
tribe
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
in
1868
the
treaty
was
passed
and
i
would
assume
after
the
treaty
the
tribe
continued
to
exercise
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
--
again
without
delivering
the
point,
i
submit
that
only
by
treaties,
the
tribes
had
these
powers
to
exercise
and
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
if
the
court
were
to
examine
the
navajo
treaty
of
1868
which
reflects
that
the
tribes
were
not
given
title
to
their
lands,
that
the
tribes
at
the
time
when
the
treaty
was
entered
into
were
cockeyed
in
and
isolated
and
exiled
people
and
that
only
because
of
the
grants
of
independence,
so
to
speak
by
the
treaty
where
they
are
allowed
to
possess
certain
lands
and
the
language
of
the
treaty
is
very
clear
to
show
that
they
have
no
title
to
these
lands
and
that
there
are
subject
to
the
control
of
agent
of
the
federal
government,
from
that
treaty
the
tribe
has
continued
to
grow
and
expand
and
to
become
more
sophisticated
in
their
powers
of
self
government
but
this
has
only
been
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
but
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
think
that
submission
is
academic
because
unless
they
have
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
as
examined,
as
derived
from
the
constitution
like
states
have.
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
any
residual
sovereignty
is
going
to
carry
the
date
to
allow
a
unprecedented
extension
of
the
dual
sovereignty
exception.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct
perhaps
my
choice
of
the
word
right
is
inappropriate
but
powers
of
self
government
which
result
a
federal
recognition.
not
to
digress
completely
your
honor,
i
think
the
language
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
which
was
subject
to
questioning
by
the
court
before
the
lunch
recess
has
a
very
telling
statement
in
it
and
i
refer
this
court
to
section
1301
of
the
act.
title
25
section
1301,
i
do
not
have
the
specific
language
of
this
court
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
its
telling
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it
to
the
court.
it
says
that
an
indian
tribe
and
this
is
congress
speaking
of
course,
means
any
tribe
banned
or
other
group
of
indians
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
recognized
as
possessing
powers
of
self
government
that
the
statute
then
proceeds
to
define
powers
of
self
government
and
indian
courts.
certainly
it
seems
reasonable
to
submit
that
this
statute
is
essentially
a
restatement
of
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
that
recognition
of
the
federal
government
or
the
indian
tribes
is
concomitant
to
their
very
existence.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
according
to
the
only
cases
that
are
recorded
on
this
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
answer
no.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question.
you
are
talking
about
successive
prosecutions
within
the
tribal
court.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
do
not
have
an
answer
to
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
i
do
not
think
i
have
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
your
honor
talton
v.
mayes
i
think
has
to
be
read
very
carefully
in
light
of
the
basic
premise
of
that
case
which
the
court
announced
initially
in
the
opinion
that
it
wrote
that
the
existence
of
the
cherokee
tribe
is
based
upon
treaties
and
statutes
and
the
tribe
exists
under
the
paramount
authority
of
united
states
and
from
that
point
forward
the
court
examined
these
treaties
and
statutes
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
indian
who
was
in
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
petition
was
not
being
denied
any
constitutionally
guaranteed
right,
that
is
lack
of
being
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
in
conformance
with
the
federal
grand
jury
law
was
merely
as
the
court
said
an
argument
in
inconvenience.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct
but
at
that
point
in
time
your
honor,
i
think
in
1896
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
requirement
applied
only
as
a
limit
on
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
an
interesting
question
your
honor
because.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
think
the
statement
is
incorrect
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why
--.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
i
agree
that
as
the
government
has
indicated
in
its
argument,
they
turned
this
case
on
talton
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
talton
was
not
good
law,
one
point
that
is
significant
and
i
do
not
have
the
answer
to
it,
i
cannot
find
any
authority
to
explain
why
prior
to
1896,
when
talton
was
decided
the
federal
government
had
enacted
the
seven
major
crimes
act
as
a
result
of
the
case
of
crow
dog,
and
that
seven
major
crimes
act
withdrew
or
took
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
offense
for
which
talton
was
indicted
by
the
tribal
court.
now,
i
have
not
been
able
to
examine
and
read
the
treaty
under
which
the
cherokees
existed
and
so
whether
that
treaty
might
be
an
exception
under
18
u.s.c.
1152
but
i
submit
that
is
the
only
possible
reason
that
might
be
argued
as
supporting
this
major
crimes
act
prosecution
by
the
tribe.
the
silence
of
the
court
on
why
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
did
not
attach
to
this
murder
prosecution
is
mysterious,
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
yes
i
was
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
no
i
do
not.
i
believe
i
make
that
statement
in
my
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
explain.
in
this
case
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
recognize
tribes
as
being
sovereign
like
states.
in
oliphant,
the
majority
opinion
in
oliphant
recognized
that
tribes
only
have
plenary
powers
and
limited
powers
of
self
government
and
based
their
decision
on
the
residual
sovereignty
that
the
tribes
retained
absent
any
controlling
or
contrary
federal
legislation.
so
assuming
for
purposes
of
arguments
that
the
tribe
does
have
residual
sovereignty
which
allows
the
tribe
to
prosecute
non-indians,
this
certainly
does
not
raise
them
to
the
level
of
being
sovereign
like
states,
so
as
to
allow
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
be
extended
with
the
indian
tribes.
so
necessarily,
i
do
not
see
any
grading
consistency
although
i
do
disagree
whether
the
suggestion
that
oliphant
is
good
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well,
in
addition
to
the
arguments
that
i
have
been
making,
i
would
submit
as
i
have
attempted
to
do
up
at
this
point
that
the
notion
of
residual
sovereignty
is
no
longer
valid
and
that
any
notion
of
sovereignty
as
this
court
recognized
in
mcclanahan
has
been
merely
used,
worcester
versus
georgia
when
justice
marshall
first
stated
it,
only
as
a
means
of
resolving
state
and
tribal
conflict
and
as
the
court
stated
in
mcclanahan
and
it
has
done
in
the
cases
since
mcclanahan,
it
has
avoided
reliance
on
what
it
categorizes
as
a
platonic
notion
of
not
a
means
of
resolving
disputes
and
has
instead
looked
applicable
to
treaties
and
statutes.
for
example,
in
united
states
versus
mazurie
which
was
mentioned
in
the
arguments
on
monday,
this
court
examined
the
relationship
of
that
particular
tribe
in
the
federal
government
and
found
that
the
tribe
exercised
powers
of
control
over
liquor
on
the
reservation
not
because
of
any
inherent
sovereign
but
because
of
a
delegation
of
that
authority
by
the
federal
government.
in
united
states
versus
keeble,
the
court
was
asked
by
the
solicitor
as
it
is
being
asked
in
this
particular
case
to
rely
on
a
notion
of
inherent
sovereignty
to
prevent
an
indian
member
from
asking
the
court
for
a
lesser
included
offense
when
it
was
clearly
merit
and
the
reason
that
the
fact
that
the
tribe
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
lesser
included
offense
prevailed
over
that
indian
member,
a
right
to
have
a
lesser
included
offense
in
the
federal
court
instead
of
relying
on
that
reasoning
or
even
rejecting
it,
i
believe
the
court
merely
looked
at
the
applicable
treaties
and
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
and
found
that
all
of
the
indians
prosecuted
in
the
federal
court
should
be
treated
equally
as
any
other
defendant
prosecutors
in
federal
court
and
then
recently
in
this
court's
opinion
in
antelope,
the
court
again
as
i
indicated
earlier
said
that
the
indian
tribes
were
once
sovereign
and
that
any
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
powers
of
self
government
were
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
this
congress’s
and
the
federal
government’s
plenary
authority
in
pertinence
of
the
word
guarding
relationship
that
exists
between
the
tribes
and
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
again
your
honor
semantically
i
do
not
think
the
words
sovereignty
for
purposes
of
this
case
is
an
appropriate
means
of
describing
that
particular
relationship.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
that
is
not
dispute
your
honor
but
i
think
for
this
court
to
recognize
them
as
sovereign
like
the
states
were
sovereign
is
unprecedented.
the
very
doctrine
in
which
the
government
wants
to
engraft
upon
successive
federal
and
tribal
prosecutions
has
never
been
applied
outside
of
the
state
and
federal
arena
and
in
fact
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
recent
case
of
reynoldi
(ph),
the
government
itself
pays
very
close
attention
to
this
court’s
continuing
concern
and
apparent
distaste
for
successive
trials
and
the
injustice
and
unfairness
that
results
from
these
trials
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
i
think,
your
honor,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
renders
that
particular
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
i
think
it
recognizes.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
nevertheless,
i
think
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
confront
that
particular
aspect
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
that
if
it
was
to
turn
this
case
on
the
reasoning
that
you
just
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
the
government.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
think
that
might
be
--
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
well
your
honor
as
i
indicated
earlier
i
could
find
no
cases
that
disposed
off
this
problem,
i
think.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
talton
versus
mayes.
that
is
correct
and
i
think
it
is
significant
to
point
that
the
government
concedes
in
their
brief
in
oliphant,
their
amicus
brief
in
oliphant,
footnote
19,
they
say
in
view
of
the
civil
rights
act
enactment,
that
talton
versus
mayes
is
moot.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
perhaps.
they
used
the
word
moot
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
as
to
my
understand
it
was
enacted
in
1885.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
have
no
explanation
except
of
the
language
of
the
cherokee
treaty
which
i
have
been
able
to
obtain,
i
think
under
1152
treaty
enactments
may
except
the
application
of
the
major
crimes
act.
i
would
like
at
this
point
your
honor
to
discuss
the
other
exceptions
that
the
government
urges
as
being
applicable
to
this
case,
even
if
the
court
does
not
find
that
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
should
prevail.
initially
the
government
would
argue
that
a
second
prosecution
is
allowed
when
the
facts
necessary
to
the
greater
charge
in
this
case
either
assault
or
a
rape
under
the
major
crimes
act
were
not
discovered
despite
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
before
the
respondent
was
prosecuted
in
tribal
court.
as
i
have
already
indicated
earlier
the
bia
was
on
the
scene
and
had
all
facts
in
hand
prior
to
the
indian
defendant
going
to
tribal
court
and
pleading
guilty
and
i
submit
that
there
a
lack
of
due
diligence
was
a
fault
of
the
government
not
that
of
the
respondent.
further
indication,
i
think
of
the
real
problem
it
involves
brought
this
case
to
this
position
that
is
at
today
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
took
seven
months
to
even
bring
this
case
to
a
federal
indictment,
and
the
fact
that
the
indian
reservation
is
far
removed
from
the
us
attorney’s
office
in
phoenix.
there
is
a
constant
problem
of
logistics
and
communication
which
is
a
various
serious
problem
because
of
language
barriers
with
indians
and
these
all
add
up
to
real
problems
which
occasionally
cause
this
type
of
a
problem
to
arise
where
an
indian
is
convicted
in
the
tribal
court,
prosecuted
in
the
federal
court
without
the
government
first
becoming
aware
of
the
early
prosecution.
i
might
also
digress
for
a
moment
to
point
out
that
judge
donahue
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
oliphant
also
authored
the
opinion
in
colliflower
versus
garland
which
recognized
that
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
at
least
indian
tribal
courts
and
the
federal
district
court
are
arms
of
the
same
sovereign.
with
that
in
mind
is
part
of
the
reason
that
i
can
see
a
consistent
decision
of
oliphant
and
this
case
in
favor
of
the
indians
in
both
instances.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
would
merely
thank
you,
your
honor
i
would
merely
conclude
by
saying
that
under
the
very
facts
of
this
case
not
the
other
exception
that
the
petitioner
urges
as
being
applicable
so
as
to
allow
a
second
prosecution
applies.
i
think
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case
your
honor
and
i
commend
them
for
their
ingenuity
is
to
ask
this
court
to
enact
congressional
policy
where
the
congress
has
not
acted
at
this
moment.
i
think
would
be
if
this
court
was
to
allow
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
be
applied
to
successive
tribal
and
federal
prosecutions
would
necessarily
raise
the
very
serious
question
of
whether
the
court’s
pronounced
in
waller
and
particular
in
puerto
rico
versus
the
shell
company
prohibiting
successive
prosecution
within
the
federal
territory
--
whether
these
cases
are
valid
at
the
present
time.
and
one
final
note
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
case
most
fairly
discusses
and
disposes
of
the
various
claims
of
the
petitioners
united
states
versus
kagama
has
made
no
indication
by
the
government
that,
that
case
is
overruled
or
that
the
language
of
that
case
is
anything
but
dicta.
i
submit
that
it
is
very
controlling
and
that
case
itself
recognizes
that
indian
tribes
have
been
subsumed
into
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
exist
only
because
of
the
political
will
of
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
w.
o'toole
i
think
it
will
have
--
as
far
as
the
tribal
structure
itself
the
tribe
will
obviously
lose
its
posture
as
being
a
self-governing
independent
entity
and
that
way
it
necessarily
will
hurt
the
tribe
and
i
think
it
is
also
significant
to
know
that
no
amicus
briefs
are
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
tribe
as
it
were
on
monday
in
the
oliphant
case.
they
are
worried
about
losing
this
case.
i
think
that
the
affirmance
of
wheeler
decision
improves
tribal
sovereignty
and
gives
finality
to
the
tribal
court's
decision
as
well
as
federal
court
decisions.
i
have
nothing
further.
