i
ask
you
one
question.
who
pays
for
the
tribal
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
sure
they
are
not
paid
by
the
federal
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
not
broken
down,
so
it
would
not
have
plenty
of
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
congress
could
not
abolish
the
tribal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
it
was
started
with
treaties.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
trouble
now.
i
mean
you
can
abolish
the
sovereign
school.

thurgood
marshall
with
the
permission
of
congress.
justice
thurgood
marshall

cannot
have
criminal
lawyer
without
a
sovereign,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
and
have
got
to
get
around
that
the
tribe
--
that
the
tribe
has
criminal
law
it
is
sovereign.

it
is
a

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
has
been
a
criminal
law.

of
the
navajo
tribe,

you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
lower

justice
thurgood
marshall
and

that
is
a
not
a
sovereign
tribe.

thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
think
you
are
bringing
--
if
you
want
to
put
a
person
in
jail,
you
need
the
sovereignty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
white
has
been
trying
to
get
you

the
power--
i
am
only
talking
about
the
power
to
put
a
man
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
where
does
the
navajo
tribe
get
that
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
essence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
the
federal
government
sits
on
each
one
of
these
cases,
the
answer
is
no,.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
who
tried
them
before
200
years
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
maintained
justice
in
the
navajo
tribe
200
years
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
did
it
100
years
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
true
even
till
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
did
not
come
from
congress.
