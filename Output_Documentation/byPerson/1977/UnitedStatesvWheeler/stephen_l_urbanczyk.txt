mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
federal
prosecution
of
an
indian
defendant
under
the
major
crimes
act
because
of
his
prior
conviction
in
tribal
court
of
lesser
included
offenses
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct.
united
states
submits
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
such
a
federal
prosecution.
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
an
incident
involving
a
young
indian
woman
occurred
on
navajo
indian
reservation
on
october
16,
1974.
respondent
was
immediately
taken
into
custody
by
an
indian
policeman
and
two
days
later
he
pleaded
guilty
in
indian
tribal
court
to
two
minor
offenses
proscribed
by
the
navajo
tribal
court.
the
navajo
tribal
court
sentenced
respondent
to
60
days
in
jail
or
to
pay
a
fine
of
$150.
thereafter
a
federal
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
which
alleged
or
which
charged
that
during
the
event
of
october
16,
1974
respondent
had
in
fact
assaulted
the
young
indian
woman
with
an
intent
to
rape
her.
now
that
indictment
was
dismissed
on
grounds
that
are
not
relevant
here
and
a
subsequent
indictment
was
entered
for
carnal
knowledge
of
female
indian
under
the
age
of
16.
now
that
indictment
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
on
the
ground
“that
the
defendant
had
already
once
been
placed
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.”
that
is
that
the
federal
offense
of
carnal
knowledge
was
dismissed
because
of
respondent’s
prosecution
and
conviction
in
the
tribal
court
of
the
minor
offenses
under
tribal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
principal
component
of
its
decision
and
the
principal
issue
before
the
court
today
is
that
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
which
has
applied
in
the
federal
or
state
context
to
allow
prosecutions
by
each
governmental
authority
for
the
same
offense
does
not
apply
in
a
tribal
context.
i
should
point
out
that
there
are
two
other
components
of
the
court’s
reasoning
that
was
essential
to
decision
in
that
case:
one
was
that
the
navajo
offense
of
contributing
to
delinquency
of
a
minor
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
federal
offense
of
carnal
knowledge;
and
the
second
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
inevitably
bars
the
same
sovereign
from
prosecuting
a
person
for
a
greater
offense
after
a
previous
conviction
for
a
lesser
offense.
we
have
not
challenged
the
first
of
those
components;
we
have
not
raised
any
question
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
specific
tribal
crime
and
a
federal
crime
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
have,
however,
as
an
alternative
submission,
suggested
that
there
should
be
an
exception
in
this
case
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
the
general
rule
that
would
bar
the
subsequent
prosecution.
but
the
main
submission
of
the
government
today
and
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
primarily
in
my
argument
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
wholly
inapplicable
in
the
federal
tribal
context
as
it
is
wholly
inapplicable
in
the
federal
state
context.
court
of
appeals
rested
its
contrary
holding
on
the
preposition
that
tribes
did
not
have
the
sovereign
status
of
states.
the
court
recognized
that
although
indian
tribes,
who
were
separate
people
that
had
powers
of
internal
self
government,
that
the
tribes
were
not
states
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
control
over
the
tribes.
these
same
kinds
of
themes
appear
in
respondent’s
brief.
our
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
does
not
with
the
premises
but
with
the
conclusion
that
it
reached.
we
agree
that
tribes
do
not
have
the
sovereign
status
of
state
precisely
because
the
federal
government
has
plenary
control
over
the
tribes,
whereas
the
federal
government’s
control
over
states
although
supreme
within
certain
defined
limits
is
not
plenary.
but
we
submit
that
--
but
we
disagree
with
the
respondent’s
and
the
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
from
that,
that
it
follows
that
tribal
courts
are
merely
arms
of
the
federal
sovereign
and
therefore
that
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
cannot
apply.
that
conclusion
rest
on
a
gross
over
simplification
of
the
status
of
tribes
in
this
country
and
also
on
an
unjustifiably
narrow
reading
of
the
dual
sovereignty
principle.
to
state
it
generally
at
the
outset,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
can
imply
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
in
this
context,
without
embracing
a
concept
of
tribal
sovereignty
that
gives
the
tribes
and
measure
of
independence
against
the
federal
government
or
that
elevates
tribes
to
the
status
of
states.
tribes
are
not
independent
from
the
federal
government,
and
there
is
only
two
sovereigns
in
this
country,
in
this
true
sense
of
that
term,
that
is
the
united
states
and
the
states.
as
i
will
explain,
however,
the
concept
of
residual
sovereignty
is
historically
and
analytically
a
correct
way
to
understand
the
powers,
the
retained
powers
of
the
tribes.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
concept,
together
with
the
undesirable
consequence
that
would
follow
with
the
court
of
appeals’
holding
were
affirmed
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
the
doctrinal
and
the
policy
justifications
that
underly
the
dual
sovereignty
principle,
apply
in
a
tribal
context
even
though
the
tribes
are
not
states.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
who
pays
for
the
tribal
courts?
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
tribal
courts,
tribal
judges
are
paid
by
the
tribe,
tribal
courts,
the
buildings
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
they
are
paid
in
the
--
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
the
navajo
tribal
court,
their
judges
are
paid
by
the
tribe.
now
i
should
point
out,
and
this
is
also
not
in
the
record
that
the
tribe
receives
from
the
bia
appropriations
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
--
which
go
towards
the
payment
of
judicial
salaries
and
the
clerk
salaries.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
the
point
i
want
to
make
with
that
is
there
are,
as
i
understand
it,
no
conditions
imposed
on
payment
of
these
appropriations
for
judges.
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
kind
of
tribal
court
which
we
described
in
the
brief
called
cfr
courts,
the
courts
of
indian
offenses;
those
are
the
qualifications
and
the
involvement
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
the
commissioner
of
the
indian
affairs
with
regard
to
the
appointment
of
those
judges
and
the
payment
of
those
judges
is
set
forth
in
the
regulation
at
25
cfr
11.3,
i
think.
but
the
point
is
that
the
navajo
tribal
court
is
not
a
court
of
indian
offenses.
let
me
then
briefly
describe
the
considerations
underlying
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
and
explain
how
they
apply
in
this
case.
the
key
cases,
of
course,
are
abbate
and
lanza.
those
two
cases
set
forth
both
a
doctrinal
explanation
for
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
and
a
policy
justification
which
explains
that
principle.
now
the
doctrinal
explanation
for
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
is
simple
and
unremarkable.
it
is
that
the
fifth
amendment”
applies
to
only
proceedings
by
the
federal
government”
and
that
is
what
is
prohibited
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
two
prosecutions
by
the
federal
government
for
the
same
offense.
that
is
why
in
lanza
and
abbate
the
double
jeopardy
was
held
not
to
apply,
there
was
only
one
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
the
other
one
was
by
the
state
whose
courts
do
not
derive
their
authority
and
their
jurisdiction
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
think
that
would
about
finish
the
principal
submission
of
the
government
here,
that
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
applies
precisely
because
that
is
not
the
case,
because
the
tribal
power
is
a
retained
power
which
has
survived
conquest
and
which
the
federal
government
continues
to
recognize.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
would
suggest
that
respondents
cannot
point
to
any
statute
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
if
you
found
express
or
implied
an
affirmative
grant
from
the
federal
government
of
authority,
a
vesting
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
in
tribal
courts.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
of
course
i
did
not
say
that
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
suppose
that
even
if
you
conceived
that
the
tribes
had
this
power
but
you
find
that
the
federal
government
terminated
its
power,
abrogated
tribes
as
they
may
well
have
done
at
the
time
that
they
subdued
them
and
then
reestablished
a
form
of
tribal
government
as
a
creation
of
federal
law,
then
i
suppose
we
have
a
tough
time
with
our
primary
argument
here.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
now,
well
saying
that
they
have
certain
kinds
of
criminal
jurisdiction
may
simply
be
a
description
of
the
kind
of
criminal
jurisdiction
that
the
federal
government
has
left
to
the
tribes
to
handle
on
their
own
on
the
basis
of
their
retained
powers.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
think
waller
versus
florida
may
provide
a
contrast
to
the
kind
of
statute
which
you
may
have
in
mind
mr.
justice
white,
the
kind
of
statute
which
i
would
concede
with
(inaudible)
here.
the
florida
constitution
as
part
of
the
sovereign
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
the
state,
establish
municipalities
and
vested
and
it
was
quoted
in
waller
v.
florida
vested
the
judicial
power
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
among
other
things,
municipal
courts.
it
is
our
point
here
and
i
think
this
is
really
consistent
with
the
entire
course
of
judicial
decision
of
this
area,
is
that
tribal
courts
are
not
creations
of
the
federal
government
in
that
sense,
and
so
i
would
submit
to
you
that
there
does
not
exist
a
federal
statute
which
creates
the
tribal
courts
or
gives
them
jurisdiction.
although
there
may
well
be
statutes
and
treaties
which
recognize
the
tribes
have
this
power.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
that’s
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
correct;
it
was
in
every
sense
a
sovereign
nation.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
again,
this
is
not
on
the
record
but
i
understand
that
there
was
rudimentary
institutions
of
justice,
i
think
they
were
called
family
courts,
i
think
crimes
of
violence
were
not
well
known
to
the
navajos,
till
the
introduction
of
alcohol
by
non-indians,
i
do
not
think
that
was
much
of
a
problem
and
so
they
had
informal
institutions
of
justice.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no
question
about
that,
i
should
point
out
there
is
no
question
here
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
crime
committed
by
an
indian
against
an
indian
in
indian
country.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no
question
and
whatever
the
court
decide
about
the
scope
of
tribal
jurisdiction
i
think
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
and
by
the
federal
government
consistently
that
with
the
exception
of
the
major
crimes
act
tribal
jurisdiction
over
those
offenses
is
exclusive.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
white
is
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
arizona
is
not
a
public
law
280
state,
it
may
be
only
in
the
sense
of
the
sovereign
jurisdiction
over
some
environmental
aspects
of
reservations
but
not
in
a
way
that
affects
this
case
at
all.
respondent
simply
is
incorrect
when
he
says
“that
navajo
tribe
exist
in
functions
only
because
it
was
created
by
the
united
states
as
an
instrument
of
congressional
policy”
the
navajo
tribe
exists
and
functions
not
by
virtue
of
enabling
federal
legislation
but
because
in
a
treaty
the
federal
government
can
recognize
its
continued
existence
and
the
fact
that
it
retained
certain
powers
of
its
original
tribal
government.
now,
i
think
that
as
i
said
this
is
established
by
the
course
of
judicial
decisions
and
i
would
think
that
the
courts
from
kagama
to
mazurie
have
talked
about
the
powers
that
the
tribe
has,
as
attributes
of
sovereignty.
i
think
this
point
is
no
better
illustrated
for
our
purposes
anyway
in
talton
versus
mayes
which
i
would
submit
to
you
as
perhaps
a
dispositive
impact
on
this
case.
in
holding
there
that
the
fifth
amendment
did
not
apply
to
cherokee
tribal
proceeding.
the
court
rested
on
two
propositions,
one
was
that
--
first
that
tribal
powers
of
self
government
are
created
by,
nor
do
they
spring
from
the
federal
government,
and
second
that
the
existence
of
the
federal
governments
plenary
authority
over
the
tribes
does
not
render
tribal
powers
or
does
not
make
them
into
federal
powers.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
1968
mr.
justice
stevens
that
is
right.
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
bill
of
rights,
the
individual
liberties
given
to
them,
did
not
act
upon
tribal
courts
because
tribal
courts
were
not
created
by
the
constitution.
the
power
to
establish
tribal
courts
existed
prior
to
the
constitution
and
that
is
the
essential
holding
of
talton
versus
mayes.
a
holding
which
has
not
been
overruled
and
which
is
not
been
i
think
cast
into
any
serious
doubt
by
subsequent
legislative
or
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
congress
could
abolish
the
tribal
courts
tomorrow--.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
think
that
it
has
been
established
by
statute
and
by
convention
that
congress
can
by
statute
it
can
by
statute
abrogate
treaties,
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
as
i
suggested
mr.
justice
marshall
the
outset.
we
think
that
the
federal
government
authority
over
indians
is
plenary
and
that
includes
abolition.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
the
powers
that
the
indian
tribes
exercise
today
are
powers
which
they
have
retained
because
the
federal
government
recognized.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
with
the
permission
is
perhaps
a
correct
way
of
thinking.
if
we
are
right
that
i
should
point
out
that
one
of
the
thing
that
respondents
suggest
is
undermined
that
subsequent
legislation
and
the
indian
civil
rights
act
and
i
think
it
was
a
undermining
thought
and
the
indian
civil
rights
act
is
based
on
the
premise
of
thought
and
is
good
law
and
that
without
some
sort
of
affirmative
congressional
enactment.
the
tribal
courts
which
are
not
creation
of
the
constitution
are
not
(inaudible)
formed
by
the
constitution
and
so
congress
imposed
these
many
of
the
civil
liberties
in
the
first
ten
amendments
upon
tribal
courts.
now
if
we
are
right
that
the
talton
is
valid.
i
think
it
establishes
that
not
withstanding
federal
authority,
plenary
federal
authority,
the
proceedings
of
navajo
tribal
code
against
responded
in
this
case
was
not
a
prosecution
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
and
if
you
do
not
agree
with
that
proposition,
i
would
submit
that
you
would
have
to
overrule
talton
versus
mayes.
on
the
other
hand
if
you
do
agree
with
that
preposition,
i
think
it
follows
under
the
doctrinal
justification
for
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
that
the
tribal
prosecution
was
not
a
federal
prosecution
and
should
not
be
construed
as
bar
in
federal
prosecution
that
we
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
today.
well
that
brings
me
to
the
policy
justifications
which
animate
the
dual
sovereignty
principle,
which
i
think
have
their
most
concise
statement
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
for
the
court
in
abbate.
without
such
a
principle,
without
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
the
court
said
there.
there
inevitably
would
be
a
conflict
between
two
independent
governmental
authorities,
each
lawfully
asserting
jurisdiction
over
the
same
subject
matter
that
sometimes
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
one
forwarding
the
interest
and
prosecutorial
interest
of
the
other.
the
predicted
result
of
such
a
conflict
is
that
one
governmental
authority
would
be
made
to
relinquish
its
jurisdiction
in
favor
of
the
other
and
when
the
federal
state
conflict,
it
was
assumed
that
in
such
a
conflict,
and
the
resolution
of
such
a
conflict
might
call
for
the
state
to
give
way.
that
is
if
the
congress
could
display
state
power
to
prosecute
crimes
based
on
acts
which
might
also
violate
federal
law
but
the
court
rejected
that
as
a
desirable
solution
to
the
problem,
called
it
an
undesirable
consequence
and
i
think
basically
that
was
the
motivating
factor
for
the
reaffirmation
of
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
in
this
consent.
the
consequences
of
not
having
a
dual
sovereignty
principle,
i
think
would
be
a
substantial
reallocation
of
the
responsibilities
for
criminal
law
enforcement
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments.
now,
these
same
considerations
i
submit
apply
in
much
the
same
way
in
the
tribal
context.
we
have
two
governments
lawfully
asserting
criminal
jurisdiction
in
indian
country.
in
the
case
of
a
crime
against
an
indian
committed
by
an
indian
as
such
as
we
have
here.
tribal
jurisdiction
normally
is
exclusive
with
the
exception
of
the
major
crimes
act
as
to
those
the
federal
government
has
asserted
jurisdiction
and
generally
the
tribes
do
not
assert
jurisdiction
but
navajo
tribal
court
for
example,
does
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
offenses
similar
to
those
in
the
major
crimes
act.
generally,
relatively
more
minor
crimes
proscribed
in
a
navajo
tribal
court.
so
we
have
two
governments,
each
asserting
substantially
different
jurisdictions
in
the
same
country.
both
governments
are
seeking
to
pursue
separate
interests.
the
tribe
to
project
the
peace
and
dignity
of
their
tribe
and
tribal
members
against
relatively
minor
offenses
which
otherwise
probably
would
not
be
and
i
guess
under
existing
structures
could
not
be
prosecuted
by
anyone
else
and
then
we
have
the
federal
government
whose
asserted
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes
which
threaten
the
peace
and
dignity
not
only
of
the
tribe
but
of
the
nation
and
the
country
as
a
whole.
the
major
crimes
act,
i
think
is
an
expression
of
congress's
intention
or
of
its
view
that
it
prosecution
of
these
major
offenses.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
the
exact
same
offense.
well
,
of
course
the
trial
has
jurisdiction
only
over
tribal
code
offenses
and
the
federal
courts
would
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
tribal
code
offenses.
but
i
would
think
that
when
you
have
an
indian
defendant
committing
a
crime
against
a
non-indian,
so
then
instead
of
prosecuting
under
1153,
the
major
crimes
act,
we
were
prosecuting
under
18
u.s.c.
1152
that
there
might
well
be
offenses
which
are
brought
into
(inaudible)
on
the
tribes
by
federal
enclave
which
are
similar
to
tribal
offenses.
i
can
not
give
you
a
specific
example
but
i
could
safely
speculate
that
there
may
will
be
such
a
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
indian
civil
rights
act
--
yes,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
has
a
double
jeopardy
provision
which
pertains
i
believe
to
a
tribal
prosecutions.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
think
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
short,
the
existing
arrangement
on
a
navajo
reservation
consists
of
two
governments,
each
asserting
jurisdiction
over
the
same
subject
matter,
same
category.
yet
each
pursuing
different
though
overlapping
interests.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
i
think
in
holding
that
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
does
not
apply.
i
think
we
can
anticipate
or
at
least
there
is
the
potential
for
a
serious
conflict
between
these
governmental
interests.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
just
one
or
two
very
short
points
mr.
chief
justice
thank
you.
in
answer
to
questions
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
blackmun
concerning
the
relationship
of
this
case
with
oliphant
i
want
to
make
government’s
position
on
that
point
clear.
this
court
could
rule
for
oliphant
and
still
rule
for
the
united
states,
i
think
that
if
the
court
rules
for
the
squamish,
i
think
the
government
would
have
a
very
--
i
think
you
would
have
to
have
reaffirmed
that
you
have
in
all
other
cases.
concept
that
whatever
powers
are
retained
by
the
tribes
are
retained
as
an
attribute
of
their
sovereignty
and
i
think
if
you
do
that
then
you
have
gone
a
long
way
towards
deciding
this
case
in
the
favor
of
the
government.
but
if
you
rule
for
oliphant
i
think
there
are
several
grounds
for
decision
that
are
available
to
you
and
i
think
there
is
only
one
of
those
grounds
that
would
hurt
us
substantially
in
this
case
and
this
is
what
i
understood
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier.
that
is
a
if
you
rule
in
oliphant
that
there
was
no
longer
any
notion
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
that
the
tribes
existed
simply
as
a
creation
of
the
federal
government
and
that
was
a
general,
then
i
think
our
principal
submission
in
this
case
would
be
in
trouble.
because
i
think
we
would
have
a
hard
time
arguing
that
these
tribes
were
not
creations
of
the
federal
government
and
that
the
prosecutions
under
them
were
not
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government.
but
any
other
holding
in
favor
of
oliphant
in
this
case
on
the
statutory
ground
i
think
would
not
effect
of
our
position
or
would
not
be
adverse
to
the
government’s
position
of
united
states
against
wheeler.
one
of
the
point
concerning
a
statement
by
the
government
in
the
amicus
brief
in
oliphant
that
talton
has
been
mooted.
that
footnote
suggest
simply
that
there
is
a
open
question
at
least
it
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
whether
1153
vest
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
or
whether
or
not
the
tribes
would
also
have
the
current
jurisdiction.
two
things
about
that
first
of
all
the
navajo
tribe,
i
want
to
make
this
clear
does
not
assert
jurisdictional
over
any
major
offense
like
those
in
the
major
crimes
act.
but
secondly
i
would
suggest
that
the
indian
civil
rights
act
moots
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
major
tribes
in
one
sense
and
that
is
after
the
indian
civil
rights
act
which
imposes
substantial
limitations
on
the
power
to
sentence
indians
are
major
offenses.
that
effectively
disables
them
from
punishing
major
offenses
and
in
that
sense
it
moots
that
question.
but
it
certainly
does
not
moot
talton
versus
mayes
and
we
submit
talton
versus
mayes
is
still
good
law
today.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
it
is
my
understanding
based
on
the
1970
version
of
the
navajo
tribal
court
that
they
do
not
assert
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non
indians.
they
assert
the
right
to
exclude
non
members
and
non
indians
from
the
reservation
and
they
have
a
proceeding
which
is
actually
undertaken
their
executive
branch
of
government
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
could
be
excluded.
he
could
be
excluded
for
everything
from
a
contagious
disease
to
committing
a
crime.
i
am
not
aware
of
the
current
status
of
the
navajo
jurisdiction
is
however.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
suggest
that.
thank
you.
