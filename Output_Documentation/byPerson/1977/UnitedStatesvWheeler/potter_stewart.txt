justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
bars
the
prosecution
of
an
indian
in
a
federal
district
court
when
he
has
previously
been
convicted
in
a
tribal
court
of
a
lesser
included
offense
arising
out
of
the
same
criminal
episode.
the
respondent,
anthony
wheeler,
is
a
member
of
the
navajos
tribe.
in
1974,
he
pleaded
guilty
in
a
navajos
tribal
court
to
charges
of
disorderly
conduct
and
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
maximum
of
60
days
in
jail
or
a
fine
of
less
than
$200.
more
than
a
year
later,
an
indictment
charging
the
respondent
with
statutory
rape
was
returned
by
a
grand
jury
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona.
the
respondent
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
indictment,
claiming
that
the
proceedings
that
had
taken
place
in
the
tribal
court
barred
a
subsequent
federal
prosecution
by
reason
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
an
intercircuit
conflict.
almost
20
years
ago
in
the
bartkus
and
abbate
cases,
reported
in
volume
359
of
the
united
states
reports,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
well-established
principle
that
a
federal
prosecution
does
not
bar
a
subsequent
state
prosecution
of
the
same
person
for
the
same
conduct,
and
that
a
state
prosecution
does
not
bar
a
federal
one.
the
basis
for
this
doctrine
is
the
prosecutions
under
the
laws
of
separate
sovereigns
do
not,
in
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment,
"subject
the
defendant
for
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy".
that
doctrine
is
applicable
in
the
present
case,
if
the
navajos
tribal
court
and
the
federal
district
court
are
courts
of
separate
sovereigns.
it
is
not
applicable
if
the
courts
are
courts
of
the
same
sovereign.
the
controlling
question
in
this
case
therefore
is
the
source
of
the
navajos
court's
power
to
punish
tribal
offenders.
is
it
a
part
of
inherent
tribal
sovereignty
or
is
it
one
--
is
it
on
the
other
hand
an
aspect
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
federal
government
which
has
been
delegated
to
the
navajos
tribe
by
congress.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
have
concluded
that
the
power
to
punish
offenses
against
tribal
law
committed
by
members
of
the
navajos
tribe
is
based
upon
the
navajos'
primeval
sovereignty,
that
this
power
has
never
been
taken
away
from
them,
and
that
it
is
attributable
in
no
way
to
any
delegation
to
them
of
federal
authority.
it
follows
that
when
the
navajo
tribe
exercises
this
power,
it
does
so
as
part
of
its
retained
sovereignty
and
not
as
an
arm
of
the
federal
government.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
