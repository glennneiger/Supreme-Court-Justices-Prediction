mr.
leonard
kirschner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
that
the
basic
matter
that
is
currently
before
this
court
in
so
far
as
the
bell
case
is
concerned
and
as
i
reflect
it
in
my
brief,
as
a
center
point
between
this
court's
decisions
in
furman
and
this
court's
decisions
in
woodson.
in
furman
we
have
unbridled
discretion,
in
woodson
we
have
no
discretion.
now,
if
we
take
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
in
which
it
is
reflected
that
there
should
be
some
discretion
and
that
there
the
sentence
should
be
tempered
and
adjusted
as
to
the
individual
defendant,
a
party
charged
with
an
offense,
the
supreme
court
or
this
court
i
should
say
has
reflected
that
the
courts
should
set
forth
with
some
specificity,
the
grounds
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
grounds
for
the
mitigating
circumstances.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
question
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
under
ohio
law
clearly
follows
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
precluded
except
in
certain
specific
instances.
in
other
words,
you
do
not
get
the
death
penalty
in
ohio
for
every
murder.
it
is
only
where
it
is
a
calculated
preconceived
thought
of
murder,
a
perpetration
of
murder
and
relative
to
certain
specific
instances
such
as
the
assassination
of
the
president,
a
person
who
is
incarcerated
where
there
are
two
or
more
persons
who
are
supposed
to
be
killed
in
an
overall
plot
and
they
are
specifically
enumerated.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
petitioners
in
this
court
have
contested
that
aspect
and
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
question
whatsoever
with
regard
to
the
first
part
of
the
statute
at
least
delineating
and
eliminating
the
passing
of
the
death
penalty
as
to
or
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
relative
to
all
murders
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
second
point
is
the
one
that
i
think
is
the
basic
point
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
one
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
has
the
authority
to
specify
what
mitigating
circumstances
will
or
will
not
be
used,
so
that
they
can
temper
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
with
regard
to
the
individual
who
is
standing
before
them
for
the
purpose
of
being
sentenced.
i
think
that
ohio
takes
and
follows
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
as
set
forth
in
the
group
of
cases
set
forth
by
gregg
and
those
that
followed
it,
in
which
the
ohio
legislature
has
set
forth
a
statute
whereby
they
specifically
open
the
statute
with
the
pronouncement
regardless
of
whether
one
or
more
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
listed
in
division
a
which
is
the
specific
types
of
murder
for
which
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed,
regardless,
that
is
the
first
word,
that
death
penalty
for
aggravated
murder
is
precluded
when
considering
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense.
the
history,
character,
condition
of
the
offender,
one
or
more
of
the
items
are
reflected
in
the
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
i
submit
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
read
some
of
the
--
it
is
reflected
on
page
7
in
my
brief,
it
is
from
ohio
revise
code,
this
is
the
section
relative
to
the
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
b,
page
7-b,
that
is
the
quotation
from
ohio
revise
code
relative
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
which
the
death
penalty
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
--
i
find
it
unusual
that
in
reading
the
briefs
and
the
response
and
i
apologize
for
this
expression,
you
are
damned
if
you
are
doing,
you
are
damned
if
you
do
not,
but
basically
it
would
appear
that
that
is
what
the
proponents
and
the
petitioners,
the
abolition
of
death
penalty
and
so
far
as
the
ohio
statute
is
concerned
are
presenting
to
this
court.
with
one
hand
they
tell
us
that
i
am
citing
unreported
decisions
which
are
not
the
law
of
the
state
and
with
the
other
hand
they
are
saying
that
i
am
citing
quotations
right
out
of
the
cases
of
ohio,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
--
the
supreme
court
should
not
be
saying
in
effect.
now,
i
believe
that
this
court
is
bound
to
give
the
interpretation
of
the
state
statutes
as
reflected
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state.
this
court
still
has
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
that
state
court's
interpretation
of
its
statute
still
pass
constitutional
muster,
but
i
think
this
court,
based
on
a
long
line
of
decisions
is
supposed
to
recognize
that
the
highest
court
of
a
state
has
the
right
to
interpret
its
statutes
and
to
include
that
in
the
totality
of
the
picture
as
to
what
the
statute
means
or
does
not
mean.
and
without
going
through
each
of
the
items
that
are
set
forth
in
my
brief,
i
believe
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
clearly
reflected
what
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
and
broadened
the
condition,
so
as
to
determine
and
make
a
prerequisite
and
take
into
consideration
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense.
aider
and
abater,
not
an
aider
and
abater,
was
he
coerced,
not
coerced,
how
does
this
total
thing,
the
history,
his
background,
his
character
and
the
condition
of
the
offender.
this
is
all
part
of
the
total
picture
upon
which
the
court
can
interpret
and
reflect
and
individualize
the
penalty
and
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
where
the
mitigating
circumstances
are
not
reflected.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
my
interpretation
that,
that
is
so,
but
i
also
would
like
to
if
i
may,
the
--
and
as
a
preview
to
this
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
there
is
a
statute
in
ohio
that
does
reflect
that
unreported
decisions
are
not
the
law
in
the
state.
however,
that
is
the
statute,
it
is
not
mandatory
and
it
is
not
followed
even
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
may
and
i
apologize
for
not
reflecting
this
in
an
opinion,
but
the
case
of
blackman
--
buehmiller
(ph)
v.
walker,
95
ohio
state
344
at
page
351,
160
north
eastern
797
at
page
80,
at
8,
page
800
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
said,
ordinarily
this
court
does
not
regard
its
unreported
cases
as
judicial
authority
for
the
reason
that
is
generally
impossible
to
ascertain
the
concrete
legal
propositions
involved
and
decided.
but
where
a
single
question
was
involved
in
that
supulently
stated
--
trying
to
read
the
small
print
--
and
decided,
it
cannot
be
said
that
such
unreported
cases
wholly
without
influence.
now,
the
above
rule
as
to
unreported
cases
has
never
been
modified,
nor
limited
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
general
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
reflected
in
the
opinion
of
gustin
v.
sun
life
insurance
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
it
is
–
that
rule
has
never
been
modified.
now,
this
referred
to
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
unreported
cases,
although
they
may
not
require
that
they
be
mandatorily
followed,
they
do
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
law
and
interpretation
of
the
law.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
i
am
saying
the
ohio
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
because
the
ohio
supreme
court
ignores
it.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no,
they
said
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
never
modified
this
position
and
pronouncement,
in
other
words,
i
am
speaking,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
gustin
v.
sun
life
insurance
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no
your
honor,
what
i
am
trying
to
present
to
this
court
is
the
fact
that
ohio
has
a
statute
which
says
unreported
decisions
are
not
binding
on
the
courts.
now,
in
interpreting
that
statute,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
said
that
although
it
is
not
binding
on
the
courts,
it
does
have
an
influence
in
interpretation
of
the
law
as
pronounced
by
a
court,
for
other
courts
to
follow.
and
i
submit
that
in
ohio,
there
are
numerous
occasions
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court,
whether
has
been
a
contrary
opinion
coming
up
from
two
different
districts,
unreported
cases
are
accepted
and
this
rule
is
followed
more
and
it
is
preached
than
its
actual
quotations
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
these
opinion
of
a
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
is
definitely
not
binding
on
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
i
would
go
one
step
further,
it
is
not
binding
on
any
other
as
you
mentioned
previously,
ohio
is
divided
up
into
districts,
but
it
does
have
in
so
far
as
other
appellate
courts,
a
great
amount
of
influence
and
it
does
have
some
influence
in
presenting
an
issue
never
previously
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
for
which
that
court
has
not
modified
by
some
other
decisions.
so
that
it
does
have
influence,
although
it
may
not
be
binding
on
the
court.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes
sir.
now,
in
the
case
of
win
v.
state
which
is
subsequently
appears
in
the
ohio
supreme
court,
that
court
of
appeals
and
as
i
say,
it
is
not
binding
on
the
court,
but
i
would
like
to
just
give
this
interpretation
if
i
may.
referring
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
involved,
the
court
held,
and
this
is
judge
mccormack
of
that
district
who
counsel
in
their
brief
reflected
said
that
ohio
statute
is
mandatory,
in
considering
in
this
mitigating
circumstance
relative
to
the
offender's
psychosis
or
mental
deficiency,
they
said
“in
considering
this
mitigating
this
circumstances,
the
court
is
constructed
to
consider
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
the
history,
character
and
condition
of
the
offender.
this
permits
if
not
instructs
the
court
to
consider
such
factors
as
prior
history
of
criminal
activity,
the
amount
of
participation
by
the
defendant
when
accomplished
by
another
person,
the
youth
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
crime
as
well
as
the
mental
and
physical
condition
of
the
defendant.”
now,
i
say
that
the
ohio
courts
are
giving
a
broad
range
of
interpretation
to
the
statute
and
they
are
following
the
supreme
court
pronouncement.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
would
say
that
the
interpretation,
reading
all
of
the
cases
and
putting
them
all
together
means
mental
deficiency
reflects
the
connotation
of
the
entire
background,
not
arising
to
that
criteria
or
weight,
there
would
be
a
defense
to
the
crime
itself.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
at
the
moment
i
will
be
quite
honest
with
your
honor
i
do
not
know.
i
think
there
is
but
i
just
cannot
specifically
quote
the
expanded
version
of
that
definition.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
the
--
it
is
18
now,
except
that
they
get
it
permission
of
the
juvenile
court
or
the
probate
court.
i
think
it
is
either
14
or
16,
but
i
do
not
know,
the
18
is
the
age
of
consent
in
ohio
though
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
ohio
has
a
law
that
invalidates
certain
contractual
–
certain
ones,
contractual
relationships
of
minors.
however,
ohio
has
several
laws
that
require
that
minors
be
responsible
for
some
of
their
tortuous
actions,
severely.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
legislative
determination
in
which
they
have
set
the
cut
off
date
at
age
18.
they
could
just
as
easily
have,
based
on
their
legislative
determinations,
set
it
at
17
or
age
21
which
was
up
till
a
few
years
ago.
so
that
i
would
say
that
this
a
determination
by
the
legislature
which
absent
a
basis
of
discrimination
in
choosing
that
age
is
for
the
legislature
to
determine
and
that
was
the
age
that
they
picked
is
18.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
would
say
this
here
that
the
legislature
has
picked
an
age
considering
many
factors.
there
are
many
people
above
that
capability
who
are
substantially
below
that
age
group.
there
are
many
people
who
are
below
it
who
are
age
wise
above
that
age
group
that
the
legislature
has
picked.
i
am
trying
to
response
your
answer
that
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
definite
fixed
thing
by
the
legislature
saying
age
18.
i
do
not
think
that
means
if
you
are
under
18
you
do
not
have
the
sense
to
do
anything
and
you
are
not
bound
for
anything
you
do
and
if
you
are
over
18
you
got
all
the
sense
that
you
need
and
we
are
not
going
to
consider
any
men
of
deficiencies.
i
think
each
individual
case
must
be
taken
in
its
entirety
and
i
think
that
the
ohio
statute
reflects
that
it
is
been
taken
in
its
entirety
and
the
supreme
court
in
this
case
so
reflected
in
considering
age
as
to
whether
the
age
affects
the
person’s
mental
ability,
mental
psychosis,
mental
deficiency,
some
people
it
does,
some
people
it
does
not.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
do
not
think
that
the
ohio
courts
have
gone
to
that
extent.
i
think
that
they
have
reflected
this
in
this
bell
case
for
one
that
is
saying
that
you
take
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense,
the
character,
history
or
the
defendant
himself
in
going
into
that
total
picture
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
courts
in
ohio
are
restricting
the
matter
to
the
fine
legal
definitions
because
if
it
was
restricted
to
the
fine
legal
definitions
and
under
those
circumstances
you
would
have
to
defense
to
the
crime
itself
and
ohio
specifically
held
that
they
are
not
going
to
hold
the
person
to
the
same
weight
or
totality
of
the
evidence
as
they
would
in
a
defense
to
the
basic
crime
itself
and
this
is
been
pronounced
several
times
in
their
opinion
and
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
defense
of
insanity,
defense
of
duress,
coercion,
duress,
coercion
was
in
the
states
v.
woods,
i
believe
in
which
they
specifically
held
that
we
are
not
going
to
hold
you
to
the
same
degree
of
proof
and
weight
of
the
evidence
in
the
proof
of
the
mitigating
factors,
as
we
would
as
a
defense
to
the
basic
crime
itself.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
is
correct,
except
that
it
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
raised
in
their
brief
by
saying
that
there
is
no
basic
difference
between
the
basic
defense
itself
and
the
mitigating
factors.
and
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
you
are
damned
if
you
are
doing,
you
are
damned
if
you
do
not
and
i
submit
further
proof
of
that
and
i
quote
from
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
this
matter
at
page
11.
there
was
recently
another
aggravated
murder
case
in
hamilton
county
in
which
a
person
was
charged
with
the
crime.
he
was
an
accomplice.
he
was
not
the
basic
perpetrator.
they
were
claiming
duress.
they
were
claiming
a
youth.
they
were
claiming
undue
influence.
counsel
i
am
certain
is
better
able
to
tell
you
everything
that
they
were
claiming
because
it
so
happens
the
same
counsel
that
is
sitting
before
this
court
today
was
counsel
in
that
case.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
is
the
erwin
case,
your
honor
and
in
the
irving
case
which
was
a
common
police
court
which
is
not
shall
we
say
binding
on
any
other
court
than
that
court,
but
it
is
of
some
advisory.
the
common
police
court
went
beyond
what
we
believe
the
statute
reflects
and
they
held
that
all
of
these
matters
are
taken
into
consideration
referring
to
accomplice,
referring
to
age,
referring
to
duress,
referring
to
coercion
and
everything
else
and
i
quote
“all
of
these
matters
are
taken
into
consideration
and
once
you
take
all
of
these
into
consideration
the
death
penalty
is
precluded
if
these
three
things
are
there.
but
still
the
trial
court
has
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
should
be
pronounced
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
legislature
intended
when
they
used
the
word
regardless
as
the
prelude
to
section
b
of
the
death
penalty
sentence,
and
he
went
on
to
make
his
determination
based
one
on
the
fact
that
this
was
an
accomplice
and
the
fact
the
person
might
have
influenced
his
age,
his
co-operation
with
the
police
etcetera
which
are
not
specifically
reflected
in
the
three
items,
but
are
in
the
totality
of
nature
and
consideration.”
and
then
we
have
this
statement
with
a
judge
who
is
doing
exactly
what
the
defense
counsel
was
asking
or
petitioners
are
asking
this
court
to
do
and
i
quote
here
a
statement
in
page
11
in
of
his
brief.
the
irving
decision
to
the
extent
that
it
represents
the
law
of
ohio
incurably
infects
ohio
capital
procedure
with
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
discretion
to
impose
the
death
penalty
contained
in
furman
v.
georgia
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
trying
to
say
here.
absence
some
specific
considerations
as
to
what
an
appellate
court
can
determine,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
or
non-sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
prove
a
specific
mitigating
factor.
how
can
an
appellate
court
make
a
determination
if
there
are
no
guidelines
upon
which
the
appellate
court
can
apply
the
evidence
to
the
guidelines
set
by
the
statute.
now,
counsel
is
asking
this
court
to
say
let
us
have
a
broad
open
field,
let
us
take
everything
under
consideration
for
the
purposes
of
mitigation
and
yet
in
the
same
time
he
is
coming
before
this
court
in
his
own
brief
and
saying
such
a
procedure
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
the
irving
case
was
decided
just
about
two
weeks
ago,
12-21
with
the
court’s
permission
if
you
are
desirous
i
can
furnish
you
with
a
copy
of
the
opinion.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
it
is
strictly
the
trial
court
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
think
it
is
wrong,
yes
your
honor
and
i
submit
further
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
i
am
saying
this
here.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
with
one
hand
to
say
ohio
cannot
specify
the
things,
you
got
to
put
a
lot
of
more
things
in
there
and
with
the
other
hand
he
is
saying
when
a
judge
does
this
and
takes
into
consideration
the
nature
and
circumstances
that
of
the
offense,
the
fact
of
the
heights
of
the
two
parties
involved,
the
character
of
the
defendant,
the
history
of
the
defendant,
the
age
of
the
defendant,
when
a
judge
does
that
he
is
wrong,
because
it
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
too
broad,
we
are
back
to
furman
v.
georgia.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
secondarily
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
he
says
primarily
i
find
for
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
he
did
find
that,
but
he
said
that
was
secondarily
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
nature
and
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
the
counsel
says
where
a
judge
uses
this
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
i
think
that
this
goes
beyond
counsel
that
i
think
that
we
are
at
a
point,
i
think
this
court
reflected
that
they
are
not
going
to
say
specifically
what
has
to
be
and
does
not
have
to
be
in
a
mitigating
circumstances
to
individualize
the
penalty.
now,
this
court
may
say
that
youth
in
and
off
itself
is
a
bar
to
any
death
penalty
and
if
it
does,
ohio
does
not
pass,
i
will
tell
you
that
now.
but
if
the
court
takes
that
to
be
taken
into
consideration
then
i
think
it
does
pass
constitutional
muster
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
reflected
that
it
is
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
the
mental
deficiency
in
my
opinion
is
interpreting
and
reading
all
of
the
cases
and
their
interpretation
of
the
language
goes
beyond
the
mental
deficiency
as
specifically
defined.
the
totality
of
all
of
the
cases
and
i
think
there
are
approximately
28
or
29
in
ohio
at
the
present
time,
goes
well
beyond
the
limited
confines
that
you
are
a
moron
or
an
imbecile
or
something
of
that
nature.
i
think
--
and
the
supreme
court
has
pronounced
this.
they
have
held
that
where
you
take
the
person’s
history,
his
background
his
nature,
circumstances,
you
take
the
total
picture
and
that
person
may
be
have
a
high
iq
and
conceivably
he
would
have
a
mental
deficiency
or
quirk
which
a
trial
court
could
based
on
the
evidence
presented
to
it
find
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
in
duress,
in
a
decision
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
at
page
38,
which
was
even
before
any
matters
concerning
the
death
penalty
in
the
case
of
dominic
(ph)
v.
robinson.
i
cited
on
page
38,
in
determining
whether
a
course
of
conduct
results
in
duress,
the
question
is
not
what
effects
such
conduct
would
have
upon
the
ordinary
man,
but
rather
the
effect
upon
the
particular
person
towards
whom
such
conduct
is
directed
and
in
determining
such
a
effect,
the
age,
sex,
health,
mental
condition
of
the
person
effect
it,
the
relationship
of
the
parties
and
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
may
be
considered.
now,
if
we
take
that
definition
and
we
hold
that
is
the
definition
as
to
the
legal
standards
and
we
take
the
ohio’s
interpretation
that
we
can
go
beyond
that.
when
we
have
a
situation
of
willie
bell
who
says
that
he
was
so
co-operative,
but
forgot
to
tell
the
police
about
the
fact
that
the
week
before
he
was
shot
off
the
shotgun
along
with
samuel
hall.
if
we
take
the
case
of
willie
bell
who
forgot
to
specifically
set
forth
in
his
brief.
now,
i
submit
that
these
are
not
matters
reflected
in
the
record
and
the
reason
was
a
witness
disappeared,
but
if
we
take
the
fact
that
willy
bell
says
that
he
want
to
date
in
ohio
long
after
any
drug
effect
which
he
might
have
had,
was
still
working
on
it.
and
he
went
there
and
he
participated
in
the
crime
of
the
putting
a
second
person
into
the
trunk
of
a
car,
assisted
in
that
preparation
in
putting
a
second
person
and
a
response
to
that
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice's
question
to
counsel,
yes
he
could
have
left
counsel
reply
that
he
could
only
have
left
the
samuel
hall
at
the
time
prior
to
the
actual
murder
itself.
but
if
i
recall
the
facts
as
reflected
in
the
record,
willie
bell
was
riding
one
car,
samuel
hall
was
riding
the
other
as
they
were
leaving
and
willie
bell
only
took
off
on
his
own
after
his
observed
a
police
car,
stopped.
samuel
hall's
car
in
which
he
had
the
second
victim
in
the
trunk.
so
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
willie
bell
could
have
cut
bait
and
left
samuel
hall
and
was
not
under
the
influence
or
duress.
and
when
we
take
willie
bell’s
reflection,
he
had
admired
samuel
hall's
style.
now,
is
that
duress,
i
do
not
think
so
and
we
take
all
these
other
things.

leonard
kirschner
