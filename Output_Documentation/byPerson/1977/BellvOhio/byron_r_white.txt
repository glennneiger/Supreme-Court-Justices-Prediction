justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
the
court
just
did
not
permit
it
to
consider
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
assume,
they
abide
their
own
statute,
they
did
not
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
ohio
courts
are
warranted
under
the
statue
in
taking
age
in
consideration
in
determining
personâ€™s
mentality?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
wants
to
argue
that
because
the
person
is
young,
it
is
more
likely
that
he
is
not
mentally
confident,
is
that
kind
of
an
argument
that
is
out
of
bounds
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
with
that
age
may
be
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
said
it
could
be
considered?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
my
question
although
is
whether
the
evidence
is
relevant
to
determination
of
mentality?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
said
they
can
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
ohio
law
it
is
not
executable
evidence,
i
mean,
it
is
a
kind
of
evidence
they
may
consider?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
the
court
said
that
they
would
consider
it?
