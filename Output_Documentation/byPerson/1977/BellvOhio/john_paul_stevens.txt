justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
also
did
not
say
anything
about
it
in
their
opinion,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kirschner,
i
just
wanted
to
--
why
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
was
following
you
as
to
your
argument,
is
it
not
correct
that
those
factors
that
you
read
are
only
relevant
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
one
of
the
three
mitigating
circumstances
are
(inaudible),
is
not
that
what
the
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kirschner,
first
of
all
in
that
case
the
judge
did
find
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
founded
that
was
the
answer
to
the
whole
loss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
did
find
a
statutory
mitigation
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
was
required
by
your
statute
not
to
impose
its
essence,
if
he
made
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
submission
that
if
the
ohio
statute
permitted
the
judge
to
give
consideration
independently
of
the
three
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
to
give
independent
consideration
to
the
youth
of
the
offender,
the
fact
that
he
did
not
pull
the
trigger
himself
and
the
fact
that
he
co-operated
with
the
police,
so
just
add
those
three,
would
the
statute
then
be
unconstitutional
in
your
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
are
really
not
in
this
terrible
dilemma
that
you
cannot
figure
our
the
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
maybe
counsel
is
inconsistent,
but
we
are
not
going
to
necessarily
do
what
counsel
says?
justice
john
paul
stevens
taken
into
consideration
only
as
to
the
whether
or
not
there
was
duress,
not
legal
duress,
but
of
coercion,
undue
influence
on
the
one
hand
or
a
mental
deficiency
on
the
other
or
for
those
two
purposes,
is
that
what
you
have
in
--
