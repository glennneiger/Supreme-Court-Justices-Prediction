chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bell
against
ohio,
6513.
mr.
hoefle
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
compare
with
the
american
psychiatric
association
definition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
fact
finding,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
place
very
much
rest
on
this
domination
of
the
one
by
the
other,
you
must
also
--
we
must
also,
i
suppose
consider
that
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
he
was
engaged
in
the
same
kind
of
an
enterprise
again.
so,
you
have
to
make
out
a
case
of
continuing
domination
of
the
one
by
the
other,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
opportunity
in
identical
of
48
hours
to
separate
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
some
of
the
district
courts
of
appeals
had
in
the
aggregate
that
reversed
a
dozen
death
penalties
last
year.
it
would
not
be
any
great
difficulty
in
finding
out
that
ultimate
fact,
would
there
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
know
whether
in
any
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
allowed
the
death
penalties
stand
that
there
was
an
absence
of
an
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
all
went
to
the
supreme
court
in
other
words.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
mandatory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
we
could
review
that
factor
here
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
read
it
and
rejected
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that
on
this
record
that
they
did
not
give
any
consideration
to
his
cooperation
with
the
police
and
his
free
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
why
i
am
probing,
is
that
your
assumption,
you
asserted
so
i
am
wondering
what
relevancy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
point
then
is
--
it
is
purely
in
attack
on
the
statute
itself,
not
on
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
what
i
want
to
do
is
sort
out
your
argument.
your
argument
must
be
directed
only
at
the
deficiency
in
the
statute
for
failing
to
allow
the
court
to
take
that
into
account,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kirschner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
show
the
date
of
irving
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
resume
their

is
1
o'
clock.
i
believe
your
time
has
expired
in
any
event

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
to
announce
in
two
cases
76-6997,
lockett

bell
against
ohio,
each
of
these
involving
the

statutes
of
the
state
of

reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
justices
supported
by
others

judgment.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
affirmed
as
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
each
case.
but
reversed
in
each
case
to
the
extent
that
those
judgments
sustained
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
cases
are
each
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this

and
rehnquist
each
filed

no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
the
case.
