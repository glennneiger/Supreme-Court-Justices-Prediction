unlike
some
states,
unless
the
situation
has
changed
in
ohio,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
territorial
jurisdiction
and
the
only
statewide
law
in
ohio
is
pronounced
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
still
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
law
of
the
--
as
enunciated
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
appellate
district
is
not
binding
at
all
for
example
in
the
first
appellate
district
in
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
has
it
changed,
has
it
changed?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
why
(voice
overlap)
that
unpublished
opinions
cannot
be
considered
to
be
the
law
even
in
the
circuit,
even
in
that
district?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
statute
that
says
so?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
per
curium
opinions?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
other
ohio
capital
case
under
this
present
and
rather
new
statute
has
a
death
sentence
been
affirmed
with
respect
to
anybody
who
was
as
young
as
bell
at
the
time
the
commission
of
the
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
--
this
proceeding
began
in
the
juvenile
court,
did
it
not,
as
required
by
law
because
of
bell's
age
and
then
there
was
a
waiver
or
surrender
of
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
to
the
common
police
court,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
present
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
present
statute,
harris
was
17?
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
death
sentence
has
been
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
juvenile
court
has
put
compulsory
jurisdiction
up
to
a
certain
age
and
then
at
least
preliminary
jurisdiction
which
it
can
waive
to
the
common
police
court
between
certain
age
and
between
what,
16
and
18,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
16,
he
cannot
be
bound
over
to
the
common
police
court,
is
that
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
we
would
agree
would
we
not
mr.
kirschner
that
a
decision
or
opinion
of
an
ohio
court
of
appeals,
whether
or
not
reported,
even
though
fully
reported,
is
certainly
not
binding
on
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
ohio's
judicial
system
in
short
and
i
am
now
advised
that
has
not
been
changed
--
justice
potter
stewart
almost
an
exact
analog
of
the
federal
judicial
system?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
defense
of
insanity?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
self
evident,
is
it
not,
if
there
were
a
case
in
which
there
could
be
no
conviction
because
either
a
duress
or
insanity
of
the
defendants
or
the
defendant
or
duress
upon
the
defendant
then
there
would
be
no
death
sentence
for
this
statute
to
apply
to
or
for
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
consider?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
irving
case?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
mr.
--
you
think
it
is
wrong?
