mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commencing
with
the
more
formal
part
of
the
argument,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
delineate
the
issues
briefly
and
to
go
into
the
ohio
statute,
both
as
the
legislative
history
has
developed
it
and
as
it
is
operational
at
the
present
time.
the
basic
issues
that
we
see
in
the
challenge
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
are,
first
is
the
ohio
statute
place
unconstitutional
limitations
upon
the
meaningful
consideration
of
mitigating
factors.
secondly,
whether
the
ohio
capital
mitigation
set
forth
in
the
statute,
so
narrowly
--
is
so
narrowly
circumscribed
by
the
statutes
and
further
by
the
judicial
clause
put
on
it
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
it
precludes
consideration
of
these
important
factors,
and
therefore,
is
virtually
a
mandatory,
and
therefore,
unconstitutional
capital
system.
finally
does
the
ohio
statute
permit
a
sentence
or
even
require
a
death
sentence
which
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
such
as
to
violate
the
constitution
and
we
claim
that
the
answer
to
those
issues
are
affirmative
in
all
three
instances.
the
ohio
capital
statute
presently
in
affect
had
its
genesis
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
furman
as
part
of
an
overhaul
of
all
of
ohio's
criminal
statutes.
when
it
was
first
introduced
and
passed
by
the
ohio
house,
it
was
a
model
of
constitutionality
as
we
have
come
to
see
from
the
gregg
cases.
it
had
open
ended,
broad
mitigating
factors
included.
it
had
jury
participation
in
the
sentencing
process
guaranteed.
it
had
a
broad
roster
of
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
statutes
provided
for
a
bifurcated
proceedings.
while
that
bill
had
passed
the
house
and
was
presently
or
was
at
time
in
the
senate
of
ohio,
this
court
decided
the
furman
case
and
the
ohio
senate
felt
required
by
furman,
due
to
its
own
legislative
service
committee's
recommendations
which
are
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
that
to
permit
discretion
even
though
there
were
specific
mitigating
factors
enumerated
to
permit
any
discretion
might
be
to
resolve
in
the
statutes
being
declared
unconstitutional
under
furman.
so
the
final
bill
as
it
was
passed,
retained
the
bifurcated
proceedings,
retained
all
of
the,
i
believe
eight
aggravating
circumstances.
the
mitigating
circumstances
which
were
open
ended
were
illuminated
eliminated
and,
but
three
narrow
mitigating
circumstances
were
put
into
the
statute.
also
omitted
from
the
final
version
was
jury
participation
in
sentencing.
we
feel
that
the
ohio
legislature
has
did
the
legislatures
in
louisiana
and
north
carolina,
misconstrued
from
it.
they
felt
i
think
that
furman
was
--
stood
for
the
position
that
any
discretion
in
the
part
of
sentencing
would
be
unconstitutional.
in
the
present
statutes,
two
statutes
within
the
same
group,
specifically
remove
discretion
from
the
trial
court
in
sentencing.
2929.03(e)
which
we
have
cited
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
indicates
that
if
the
court
finds
that
none
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
listed
in
division
b
of
2929.04,
the
revise
code,
is
established
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
it
shall
impose
sentence
of
death
on
the
offender,
otherwise
it
shall
impose
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
on
the
offender.
now,
it
is
fairly
clear
in
itself,
but
they
go
on,
on
page
6
of
our
brief
it
is
cited,
they
repeat
this
and
this
is
2929.04(b)
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
the
three
mitigating
circumstances
which
we
will
discuss
in
a
moment
are
listed.
again,
it
states
that
death
penalty
is
precluded
when
considering
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense,
the
history
character
or
condition
of
the
offender,
one
or
more
of
the
following
is
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
precluded.
so
the
sentencing
really
has
no
discretion
at
all
under
the
ohio
statute.
if
the
facts
are
--
as
found
to
constitute
a
mitigating
circumstance,
then
the
offender
will
live.
if
the
facts
do
not
constitute
one
of
the
three
statutory
mitigating
factors,
he
will
die.
so
there
is
no
sentencing
discretion
whatsoever.
even
more
significant
change
that
the
ohio
senate
made
in
the
statute
in
response
to
furman
was
the
narrowing
of
the
mitigating
factors.
the
broad
open
ended
mitigating
factor
was
eliminated,
but
three
remained.
i
would
distinguish
that
from
i
believe
eight
in
florida
and
the
open
ended
statutes
in
the
texas
and
georgia
statutes.
the
most
important
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
because
it
is
the
only
mitigating
circumstance
that
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
personality
and
the
individual
offender
is
the
third
and
that
provides
that
the
death
penalty
is
precluded
if
the
offense
was
primarily
the
product
of
the
offender's
psychosis
or
mental
deficiency,
though
such
condition
is
insufficient
to
establish
the
defense
of
insanity.
psychosis
has
been
defined
as
a
major
severe
form
of
mental
disorder
or
disease
that
is
random
house
dictionary's
definition
and
webster
as
the
aggitive
profound
mental
disease.
so,
either
a
person
who
is
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
on
psychosis,
i
believe
it
is
close
your
honor.
i
frankly
have
not
seen
the
american
psychiatric
definition
of
psychosis.
i
believe
that
is
fairly
close.
at
any
rate
i
think
it
is
severe.
my
college
psychiatric
course
said
the
way
to
distinguish
a
psychotic,
it
has
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
a
neurotic
need
not.
that
is
maybe
a
lay
definition
or
distinction.
but
the
mental
deficiency
is
the
key
because
that
is
not
defined
in
the
statute,
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
construed
it
and
they
have
construed
it
as
being
equivalent
to
mental
retardation.
this
was
in
their
first
post
furman
capital
case,
state
v.
bailus.
they
cited
two
medical
dictionaries,
case
law
and
the
court
psychiatrist
in
that
particular
case.
in
the
medical
dictionaries
they
cite
--
indicate
to
further
characterize
what
retardation
is,
is
that
a
moron
is
the
highest
retard
in
intelligence
and
an
idiot
is
the
lowest
in
an
imbecile
is
in
between.
the
authorities,
psychiatric
authorities
cited
in
our
brief
indicated
that
a
moron
is
someone
with
an
iq
of
70
or
less,
a
mental
age
of
12
or
less
and
the
other
two
are
below
that.
therefore,
under
the
ohio
statute,
under
this
third
mitigating
circumstance,
the
only
one
dealing
with
the
offender
himself,
only
a
psychotic,
a
moron,
an
imbecile
or
an
idiot
has
a
reasonable
chance
of
surviving
the
sentencing
process
and
then
only
if
that
condition,
that
mental
condition
caused
the
offense.
the
other
statutory
factors
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is,
it
is
strictly
fact
finding,
yes
sir.
and
that
is
fact
finding
by
the
trial
judge
where
the
three,
if
it
is
a
one,
two
or
three
judge
panel
as
we
did,
then
the
three
judges
decide
and
they
must
unanimously
find
that
none
of
these
circumstances
are
present
before
they
can
sentence
a
man
to
death.
if
one
of
the
judges
finds
a
circumstance
present
then
the
sentence
is
life,
even
though
the
other
two
may
feel
that
the
death
penalty
is
warned.
the
first
of
these
three
mitigating
circumstances
as
it
appears
in
the
statute
is
victim
inducement,
that
the
victim
induced
or
facilitated
his
own
death.
if
this
can
be
shown
to
a
preponderance,
then
the
offender
will
escape
with
his
life.
however,
we
must
remember
that
we
are
talking
about
an
aggravated
murder
situation.
not
all
taking
of
life
is
aggravated
murder.
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
must
be
present.
the
only
one
that
i
could
conceive
would
be
murder
for
hire,
because
that
would
involve
the
victim
hiring
his
own
killer.
i
suppose
if
a
case
like
that
ever
comes
along,
perhaps
the
victim
inducement
mitigation
will
have
some
significance,
but
we
feel
that
it
is
basically
illusory.
although,
there
was
one
northern
ohio
appellate
case
where
the
court
did
find
victim
inducement
where
the
victim
was
armed
and
it
involved
a
narcotics
purchase.
however,
that
unreported
appellate
case,
added
another
element.
they
said,
that
the
only
time
you
can
even
consider
using
victim
inducement
is
mitigation
as
if
the
victim
himself
is
acting
unlawfully
and
that
condition
is
not
even
in
the
statute.
the
final
mitigating
circumstance
is
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
offense
would
have
been
committed,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
offender
was
under
a
duress,
coercion
or
strong
provocation.
duress
and
coercion
though
has
been
interpreted
in
ohio's
capital
context
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
such
compulsion
that
will
overcome
the
mind
or
volition
of
the
defendant,
so
that
he
acted
other
than
he
would
ordinarily
have
acted
in
those
circumstances
which
we
feel
at
least
more
as
the
distinction
if
any
between
mitigating
duress
and
coercion
and
the
duress
and
coercion
which
is
a
defense
to
any
crime.
in
our
own
case,
they
have
further
blurred
that
distinction
by
applying
the
doctrine
of
withdrawal,
on
page
142
of
the
appendix.
the
court
said,
even
if
it
were
believe
that
appellant,
that
is
bell,
was
apprehensive
of
hall
and
was
forced
to
go
along
with
the
crimes,
the
hard
fact
remains
that
appellant
could
very
easily
have
quit
the
scheme
when
following
in
another
car.
and
in
the
other
case,
the
woods
case
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
in
discussing
the
doctrine
of
withdrawal,
withdrawal
as
applied
to
the
defensive
of
duress,
really
blurred
the
distinction
between
the
two.
there
really
is
no
distinction.
if
a
defendant
is
acting
of
his
own
free
mind
or
will,
then
he
is
under
such
duress
or
coercion
that
makes
him
not
guilty
of
the
offense
at
all
and
he
will
not
even
have
to
worry
about
getting
to
a
penalty
trial,
because
he
will
be
found
not
guilty
at
the
close
of
the
trial.
now,
it
is
important
to
note
here,
extremely
important
that
these
are
three
exclusive
mitigating
factors.
there
are
no
other
mitigating
factors
in
ohio,
either
in
the
statute,
or
in
the
interpretation.
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
some
other
factors
in
some
of
the
cases,
but
there
are
no
other
mitigating
factors.
in
our
particular
case,
where
we
have
alleged
several
mitigating
factors
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
constitutionally
significant
which
we
will
discuss
in
a
moment
that
basically
they
are
the
youth
of
the
offender,
his
non
participation
in
the
offense,
his
cooperation
with
police,
his
drug
involvement,
his
emotional
disturbance,
his
domination
by
someone
else,
none
of
these
factors
were
considered
at
least
independently.
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
and
this
is
at
a
141
of
the
appendix,
we
will
examine
each
of
the
three
mitigating
circumstances
provided
for
in
the
statute
to
determine
if
the
evidence
established
with
such
a
mitigating
factor
existed,
that
is
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
in
an
ohio
penalty
trial
and
that
is
the
only
scope.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
connection
that
at
the
time
of
the
second
event
the
next
day,
hall
still
had
the
shotgun.
he
was
still
ordering
bell
around,
as
testimony
of
the
witness
indicated.
bell
was
16
years
old,
50
some
miles
away
from
the
home
having
been
driven
there
by
hall,
he
did
not
know
where
he
was.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
would
think
the
court
might
reasonably
conclude
there
would
have
been
an
opportunity
before
the
killing
of
graber,
but
afterwards
i
would
say
definitely
not.
bell
was
still
under
the
influence
of
drugs.
hall
drove
the
two
to
dayton
and
as
far
as
we
know
bell
had
never
been
there.
hall
still
had
the
shotgun.
the
fact
is
i
think
that
if
we
are
talking
about
strong
domination,
that
is
the
kind
of
--
if
it
is
not
particularly
strong
domination,
maybe
he
would
have
broken
away.
but
strong
domination
which
i
think
has
been
recognized
as
mitigating
is
the
type
of
thing
which
will
coerce
someone
in
going
along.
the
fact
remains
further
in
discussing
the
mental
deficiency
aspect
as
defined
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
the
court
has
had
many
cases
before
it
where
mental
problems
have
been
alleged
and
in
not
one
has
it
reversed
the
sentence
of
death.
in
fact
it
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
not
on
mental
deficiency
to
my
knowledge,
there
may
have
been.
we
do
not
get
the
unreported
decisions.
i
cannot
say
that
one
case
cited
by
the
respondent
haynes
and
lucas
which
i
referred
to
before
on
victim
inducement,
that
was
reversed.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
they
have
reversed
the
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
was
involved.
in
our
experience
in
hamilton
county,
those
cases
were
reversed
on
way
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
see,
other
court
of
appeals
throughout
the
state?
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
not
aware
of
any
except
in
our
own
jurisdiction
and
the
one
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
see.
well,
i
would
like
to
stand
correct
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
just
recently
did
reverse
a
death
penalty
because
of
a
procedural
irregularity
in
the
penalty
trial,
but
not
because
the
death
penalty
mitigation
factors
were
too
narrow
or
because
the
factor
was
met
by
the
evidence.
i
am
certain
that
there
maybe
some,
but
i
do
not
want
to
tell
you
that
i
believe
that
there
are
and
not
be
able
to
tell
you
what
they
are.
haynes
and
lucas,
i
am
aware
of
in
the
fifth
appellate
district.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
exactly
correct
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
sir,
that
is
still
true.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
agree
with
that
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
it
has
not
changed.
it
is
still
that
way
your
honor
and
the
appellate
decisions
on
aggravated
murder
cases
are
not
being
reported
in
ohio.
those
--
if
a
death
penalty,
by
and
enlarge,
if
a
death
penalty
is
affirmed,
there
is
an
automatic
right
of
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
those
cases,
i
do
not
know
what
the
reason
is,
it
is
apparently
because
the
ohio
supreme
court,
all
of
its
opinions
are
published,
they
do
not
bother
to
publish
most
of
the
intermediate
appellate
decisions
which
is
why
we
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
well,
there
is
a
statute
and
we
cited
that
in
our
reply
brief.
i
will
admit
that
it
is
not
always
observed
that
it
is
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
there
is
a
statute
that
says
so,
but
i
would
have
to
admit
that
i
cite
unreported
case
myself
when
it
suits
my
purpose
in
that
court
of
appeals,
if
i
know
about
it.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
see,
is
that
a
question
or
a
comment,
your
honor?[laughter]
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
think
so.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes,
per
curium
opinions
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
are
all
the
law
other
than
that
it
is
only
the
syllabus.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
would
not
think
so,
i
would
not
think
so.
the
point
is
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
not
and
again
they
are
the
--
that
court
is
the
court
which
says
what
the
law
of
ohio
is
and
we
are
here
on
the
ohio
statute
and
what
that
means.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
do
not
know
of
any
such
case
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
they
all
do.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
it
is
not
strictly
automatic
but
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
it
is
mandatory
that
they
take
it
if
the
lawyer
files
the
paper,
yes
sir.
i
assume
all
the
lawyers
are
filing
the
papers
in
death
penalty
cases.
there
are
several
relevant
facts
in
our
case
which
were
not
given
meaningful
consideration
as
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
bell
was
16
years
of
age
when
the
offense
was
committed
and
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
cited
statistics
that
only
three
individuals
in
our
country
since
1955
of
over
350
who
were
executed
were
under
the
age
of
18.
so
whether
it
is
cruel
or
not
to
execute
a
child,
it
is
at
least
unusual.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
he
is
20
at
the
present
time,
i
would
submit
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
perhaps
not,
it
depends
on
whether
the
states
in
those
cases
sentenced
a
child
and
then
waited
until
they
grew
up
before
they
executed
them.
i
do
not
know.
that
would
be,
i
would
submit,
if
not
unusual,
certainly
cruel
to
do.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
would
say
it
is
unusual.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
the
statistics
did
not
tell
us,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
do
not
believe
so.
there
was
bates
i
believe,
he
was
18
or
19
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
i
do
not
think
he
was
a
juvenile.
now,
bell
was
a
juvenile,
the
first
case
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
came
out
with.
i
believe
he
was
17
at
the
time.
he
already
had
a
prior
capital
conviction
on
his
record
even
at
that
time.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
sir,
there
is
a
finding,
it
is
in
page
1
in
the
appendix,
setting
forth
and
it
does
comply
with
the
statute,
that
indicate
the
court
did
have
to
look
into
all
these
factors,
before
it
can
bind
them
over
and
one
of
which
is
whether
he
will
be
–
they
will
be
able
to
help
him
with
whatever
facilities
they
have.
i
am
advised
also
that
in
the
harris
case
the
defendant
was
17
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
am
sorry.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
oh!
yes
sir,
i
believe
he
was,
but
that
was
not
the
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
sir,
bailus
was
17,
i
believe
royster
was
17.
so,
there
are
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
correct
and
i
think
we
are
finding
that
almost
any
juvenile
charged
with
a
serious
felony
over
the
age
of
16,
it
is
an
almost
automatic.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
my
understanding.
there
are
other
mitigating
circumstances
exhibited
by
bell.
he
was
cooperative
with
the
police.
i
expect
the
respondent
to
quote
some
language
has
he
already
has
in
his
brief
about
how
some
of
the
factors
we
are
talking
about,
youth
etcetera
can
be
shoehorned
in
or
funneled
into
one
of
the
ohio
mitigating
circumstance,
but
there
are
some
that
are
important,
that
cannot
be
and
cooperation
with
police
as
one
of
them.
the
man
was
arrested,
an
hour
or
two
later
he
was
advised
of
his
rights,
he
was
not
beaten,
not
abused.
he
told
them
what
happened
and
he
gave
the
first
full
complete
story
of
version
of
what
happened.
he
cooperated,
that
is
no
place,
even
though
in
the
gregg
and
the
harry
roberts
case,
this
court
indicated
that
was
important.
in
the
ohio
scheme
it
cannot
get
any
mitigating
effect.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
sir,
because
i
do
not
think
they
--
in
the
context
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
it
was
not
considered.
i
do
not
think
they
weighted
or
rejected.
they
just
looked
at
whatever
facts
were
put
in
there
and
the
decided
if
the
man
was
shown
to
be
psychotic,
mentally
deficient
under
duress,
coercion
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
have
been
relevant
to
the
--
it
maybe
an
assumption
on
my
part
how
it
could
be
relevant
to
the
existence
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
sir,
i
assume
and
i
think
it
will
hold
up
because
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no,
it
is
exclusive
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
they
just
stated
that
we
have
reviewed
everything
and
found
that
none
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
provided
by
the
statute
have
been
proved
to
a
preponderance,
therefore,
the
defendant
dies
and
the
trial
court's
words,
language
was
almost
the
same
language,
perhaps
they
were
consciously
just
stating
what
the
statute
said
to
make
sure
that
they
comply
with
it.
i
think
that
language
indicates
how
closely
they
wish
to
comply
with
the
statute.
these
factors
certainly
were
brought
forward
by
us.
further
his
mental
and
emotional
state
and
we
emphasize
that
it
is
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
the
mental
and
emotional
state.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
although,
the
statute
itself
does
not
permit
them
to
do
anything
more
and
they
did
not,
even
if
they
would
have
the
power
too,
they
did
not
exercise
that
power,
that
is
our
claim.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
that
is
so.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
mr.
kirschner's
argument,
justice
powell
asked
the
question
regarding
the
definition
of
mental
deficiency
and
whether
or
not
that
had
been
changed.
on
page
23
and
24
of
our
brief
we
cite
all
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
cases
to
date
involving
allegations
of
mental
deficiency.
the
bailus
case
explicitly
limited
mental
deficiency
to
retardation
or
low
intelligence
and
excluded
emotional
cultural
or
behavior
abnormality,
23
and
24.
the
harris
case
explicitly
holds
that
a
17
year
old
associate
help
is
not
considered
psychotic
or
mentally
deficient
under
the
statute.
the
royster
case
refused
to
equate
iq
with
mental
deficiency
and
held
that
there
was
no
mental
deficiency
in
the
case
of
a
defendant
whose
iq
is
75
in
1962,
1961,
in
1966
and
1954
and
1968.
the
edward’s
case
explicitly
holds
that
educational
deficiency
does
not
equal
a
mental
deficiency
and
finally
in
our
case
the
court
found
no
mental
deficiency
even
though
the
defendant
was
16,
at
that
time
considered
emotionally
immature
not
only
as
an
adult
by
adult
standards,
but
on
a
peer
group
standard.
he
was
less
mature
then
the
average
16
year
old.
he
was
on
drugs
on
a
daily
basis
for
three
years
up
until
the
day
he
was
arrested.
that
his
iq
tested
in
1972
at
81.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
not
under
the
definition
of
mental
deficiency
as
they
have
given
here
your
honor
because
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
we
argued
here
that
because
he
was
16
he
was
per
se
mentally
deficient
under
the
statue
and
they
said
no,
they
said
age
can
be
considered.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
no
i
do
not
agree
with
that
because
i
do
not
think
age
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
see
and
that
might
correspondingly
relate
to
iq,
but
our
point
is
that
when
we
discuss
youth
that
we
should
not
execute
children,
we
are
taking
about
--
in
mental
deficiency,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things,
you
can
be
a
genius
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
i
do
not
think
that
evidence
itself.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
so
they
did,
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
meaningfully
give
a
consideration
in
determining
whether
the
man
–
the
defendant
--
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
well,
under
the
statute
you
can
put
in
anything
you
want.
the
only
thing
is
that
none
of
it
has
any
meaning.
mr.
h.
fred
hoefle
yes
they
did
say
that.
in
closing
i
would
like
to
again
quote
the
statute
very
briefly,
is
that
the
2929.04(b)
where
regardless
of
whether
one
or
more
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
listed,
just
specify
and
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
death
penalty
is
precluded
when,
considering
the
nature
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
history,
character
and
condition
of
the
offender,
one
or
more
of
the
following
is
established
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
than
at
least
the
three
narrow
mitigating
factors.
thank
you.
