unknown
speaker
have
not
the
court,
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
reversed
a
number
of
them?
unknown
speaker
alright,
are
you
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
ohio
had
not
reversed
or
set
aside
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
about
the
state,
not
hamilton
county?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should
think
you
would
be
when
you
make
the
statement
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
never
set
aside
the
death
penalty.
you
have
another
appellate
court
there.
i
should
think
you
would
know
what
the
facts
are
before
you
make
that
kind
of
a
statement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kirchner,
just
so
i
am
--
what
did
you
just
read
--
unknown
speaker
which
number
did
the
--
unknown
speaker
2929.04(b).
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
but
may
i
ask
you
a
question
along
the
line
of
your
argument.
the
state
against
bailus,
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
undertook
to
define
the
mental
deficiency.
has
there
been
anymore
recent
definition
of
mental
deficiency
by
your
court
or
is
that
the
definition
that
you
consider
binding?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
more
recent
case
than
bailus
that
specifically
undertakes
to
define
mental
deficiency,
i
have
in
mind
--
unknown
speaker
in
bailus
as
i
read
it,
mental
deficiency
is
defined
to
me,
a
normal
or
subnormal,
whether
it
is
normal
or
subnormal
intelligence
and
i
ask
you
now,
does
ohio
have
laws
that
limit
of
that
age
at
which
the
minors
may
marry?
unknown
speaker
what
age
is
that?
unknown
speaker
does
ohio
have
a
law
that
invalidates
contracts
made
by
minors
and
if
so
at
what
age?
unknown
speaker
these
laws
as
i
have
been
talking
about
based
on
intelligence
of
the
minor
or
on
the
assumption
that
the
experience
of
mankind
suggest
that
up
till
certain
ages
there
may
be
a
lack
of
maturity,
a
lack
of
judgment
or
some
other
deficiency
that
may
affect
the
conduct
of
the
minor?
unknown
speaker
granted
there
is
certain
amount
of
arbitrary
in
selecting
these
ages,
the
point
i
am
making
--
asking
you
of
whether
or
not
they
relate
to
the
iq
of
the
individual
at
the
time,
their
iq
questioned?
unknown
speaker
but
no
consideration
of
maturity
or
judgment
or
susceptibility
to
the
influence
of
others
of
--
that
is
what
your
court
had
said
in
affect
as
i
read
the
bailus
which
ends
up
defining
mental
deficiency
as
sub-normal
intelligence.
you
can
be
of
15
years
old
and
have
an
iq
of
140,
but
your
judgment
might
not
be
very
mature?
unknown
speaker
what
the
court
link
to
was
senility,
indicating
something
in
addition.
unknown
speaker
well,
senility
means
more
than
old
age.
it
means
imperative
of
your
mental
or
emotional
because
of
old
age?
