in
this
case
the
court

for
the
first

in
conflict
with

held
that
a
sentencing
judge
replaces
a
youth
offender
on
probation
under
section

a
of
the
youth
corrections
act.
they
impose
a
fine
and
order
restitution,
as
conditions
of
probation.
here
again,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
affirm
it's
judgment.
mr.

took
no
part
in
consideration
or
