mr.
michael
s.
frisch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
fine
or
requirement
of
restitution
may
be
imposed
upon
one
sentence
to
probation
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
18
united
states
code
section
5010
(a).
each
petitioner
entered
a
pleaded
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
violation
of
federal
law
before
united
states
magistrate
in
maryland
and
each
was
placed
on
probation
under
the
terms
of
the
youth
act.
petitioner
rice
being
sentenced
under
the
terms
of
that
act
which
extends
it
to
young
adult
offenders.
each
was
ordered
to
pay
a
fine
to
the
united
states
and
additionally
petitioner
durst
was
ordered
to
make
restitution
on
a
stolen
check.
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
other
lower
federal
courts
which
have
held
fines
to
be
permissible
under
the
youth
act
have
essentially
relied
upon
two
sections
of
the
statute
and
inferred
these
two
sections
a
congressional
intent
to
permit
fines.
the
first
of
these
sections
is
section
5023
(a)
of
title
18
which
in
effect
incorporates
the
indult
probation
statute
section
3651
of
title
18
into
the
youth
act,
and
the
courts
have
reasoned
that
since
fines
are
a
permissible
condition
of
probation
for
adults,
they
are
also
permissible
under
the
youth
act.
what
we
respectfully
suggest
that
this
argument
ignores
is
that
the
power
to
impose
a
fine
does
not
originate
with
section
3651,
rather
it
originates
with
the
substantive
statute
under
which
a
person
is
convicted.
we
respectfully
suggested
the
court
that
when
one
is
sentenced
under
the
youth
act,
once
a
finding
of
benefit
is
made
under
that
act,
once
one
is
deemed
to
be
worthy
of
the
treatment
and
rehabilitation
provided
for
by
that
act,
they
are
no
longer
punished
for
the
offense.
as
provided
for
by
rule
3651,
rather
they
are
made
subject
to
the
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
the
act,
and
as
a
result
of
that
we
suggest
that
reference
to
3651
which
can
not
be
read
as
a
penalty
provision
within
itself,
can
in
now
way
be
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
permit
fines
under
the
youth
act.
now
the
question
might
naturally
arise
what
was
the
purpose
of
enacting
5023
(a)
by
congress
if
it
were
not
to
impose
fines.
unfortunately
the
legislative
history
with
regard
to
the
act
is
not
really
very
helpful
in
this
regard.
there
are
perhaps,
however,
a
number
of
reasons
why
5023
may
have
been
enacted
rather
than
to
permit
fines.
i
think
perhaps
the
best
of
these
reasons
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
youth
act
itself.
congress
knew
when
it
enacted
the
youth
act
that
it
did
not
create
any
specialized
programs
of
treatment
and
rehabilitation
for
youth
act
probationers
as
oppose
to
those
sentenced
under
the
imprisonment
provisions
of
5010
(b).
realizing
that,
congress
made
it
quite
clear
by
enacting
5023
(a)
that
whatever
programs
of
treatment
and
rehabilitation
were
available
to
adults
under
3651
are
made
equally
available
to
youth
offenders
by
the
operation
of
5023
(a).
additionally,
the
argument
has
been
made
and
adopted
number
of
judges
in
the
district
court
of
maryland
that
as
a
result
of
the
operations
of
5023
(a)
and
the
incorporation
of
the
general
probation
statute
that
a
split
sentence
can
be
imposed
under
the
youth
act
that
is
to
say
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
up
to
six
month
to
be
followed
by
a
period
of
probation.
by
doing
this
it
gives
a
court
in
fact
a
middle
ground
between
5010
(a)
and
5010
(b)
without
requiring
the
indeterminate
sentence
of
up
to
four
years.
additionally,
a
fair
reading
of
3651
which
we
suggest
to
this
court
demonstrates
that
intent
to
fine
does
not
exist
fairly
clearly,
absolutely
clearly
sets
out
that
restitution
is
permissible
under
the
youth
act
and
we
are
prepared
to
concede
at
this
time.
it
is
quite
clear
under
3651
that
restitution
is
a
permissible
condition
of
probation.
the
second
section
of
the
statute
that
the
courts
have
relied
upon
in
order
to
permit
fines
under
the
youth
act
is
in
fact
changed
in
the
original
language,
the
proposed
language
of
5010
(b)
which
originally
read
that
imprisonment
under
youth
act
was
in
lieu.
penalty
otherwise
provided
by
law,
and
this
was
changed
in
the
present
form
of
the
law
to
penalty
of
imprisonment.
there
is
a
letter
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
in
support
to
the
proposition
that
this
permits
fines.
in
response
to
that
we
would
make
two
argument
to
the
court:
first
and
most
importantly,
5010
(b)
is
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
that
is
a
separate
and
distinct
sentencing
alternative
from
5010
(a)
and
not
the
one
for
decision
in
this
case.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
dorszynski
stated
at
page
43,
the
act
creates
two
new
sentencing
alternatives,
and
the
one
before
this
court
is
the
probation
alternative
and
not
the
incarceration
alternative.
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
mr.
attorney
general
biddle
--
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
not
an
ordinary
letter.
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
well,
it
was
a
letter
written
to
the
house
committee
considering
the
bill,
i
believe,
transmitted
from
the
judicial
conference
considered
to
the
youth
act.
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
secondly,
if
the
court
does
--
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
that
is
correct
with
reference
to
be
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
the
court
is
convinced
--
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
important
point
to
be
made
is
that,
that
letter
and
the
change
language
was
referenced
to
the
incarceration
alternative.
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
language
in
5010
(a)
which
states
that
the
sentencing
judge
may
suspend
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence.
if
congress
was
aware
of
the
necessity
to
change
the
language
with
respect
to
(b)
to
add
the
language
in
lieu
of
penalty
and
imprisonment,
i
think
the
question
might
reasonably
be
asked,
why
a
similar
change
was
not
enacted
as
to
(a)?
why
that
same
limiting
language
was
not
put
into
(a)?
the
government
in
its
brief,
i
believe,
response
to
this
argument
by
stating
that
it
would
be
illogical
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
fines
with
respect
to
the
incarceration
alternative
but
not
with
respect
to
probation.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
logical
distinction
between
people
sentenced
under
5010
(b)
and
people
sentenced
under
5010
(a).
i
believe
a
sentencing
judge
makes
a
qualitative
distinction
between
one
who
is
in
need
of
the
incarceration
alternative
and
one
who
is
only
in
need
of
probation
supervision
and
at
this
shows
a
different
type
of
person
that
is
being
treated
by
the
court
with
respect
to
(b)
as
oppose
to
(a).
mr.
michael
s.
frisch
no
your
honor.
i
am
prepared
to
concede
that
restitution
is
proper
from
the
fair
reading
of
section
3651.
i
believe
the
distinction
to
be
made
between
fines
and
restitution
is
that
the
power
to
impose
restitution
resides
right
in
the
probation
statute.
with
respect
to
fines,
it
refers
back
to
the
substantive
offense
with
which
a
person
is
committed.
the
final
concern
of
courts
that
have
found
fines
to
be
permissible
under
the
act
is
that
to
hold
otherwise
would
deny
the
benefits
of
the
act
to
otherwise
qualify
the
young
offenders,
and
i
can
not
state
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
at
least
the
possibility.
however,
i
would
hope
that
sentencing
judges,
particularly
those
cognizant
mr.
justice
marshall’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
dorszynski
case
which
describes
of
youth
act
as
a
preferred
sentencing
alternative
which
still
treated
as
such
and
not
deny
the
benefits
of
the
youth
act
to
an
otherwise
qualified
individual,
merely
because
congress
did
not
provide
for
a
fine
in
the
sentencing
scheme.
secondly,
having
conceded
that
restitution
is
permissible
and
appropriate
under
the
act
in
the
correct
case,
i
would
think
that
in
most
cases
where
a
fine
would
be
called
for
where
the
individual
had
either
financially
profited
from
his
offense
or
caused
his
victim
to
cause
some
loss,
the
fact
that
restitution
is
available
under
the
act
might
go
along
way
toward
procuring
that
concern
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
other
courts
that
have
permitted
fines
with
respect
to
denying
the
benefit
of
the
act.
regardless
of
that,
we
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
real
issue
here
is
one
of
statutory
constructions,
one
of
the
fair
readings
of
the
act
and
that
although
fines
maybe
a
wise
policy
under
the
act.
that
is
not
the
question
before
this
court;
it
is
merely
a
question
of
what
congress
provided
for.
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
act,
reading
3651,
and
the
change
in
language
with
respect
to
5010
(b)
is
simply
not
a
sufficient
indicator
of
congress’
intent
as
to
this
penalty.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
