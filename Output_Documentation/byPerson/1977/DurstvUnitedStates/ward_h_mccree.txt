mr.
ward
h.
mccree
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
contends
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
supported
not
only
by
the
literal
terms
of
the
youth
corrections
act
but
also
by
the
act’s
legislative
history.
the
provisions
under
which
petitioners
were
sentenced,
18
u.
s.
c.
section
5010
(a)
provide,
if
the
quarters
of
the
opinion
that
the
youth
offender
does
not
need
commitment,
it
may
suspend
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence
and
place
the
youth
offender
on
probation.
now
nothing
in
this
provision
or
in
any
other
provision
of
the
act
precludes
the
imposition
of
a
fine,
and
since
my
brother
concedes
that
restitution
is
not
proscribed,
i
will
not
labor
that.
indeed,
such
5023
(a)
of
the
act
expressly
provides
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
limit
or
affect
the
power
of
any
court
to
suspend
the
imposition
of
execution
of
any
sentence
and
place
the
youth
offender
on
probation,
or
be
construed
in
any
wise
to
amend,
repeal,
or
affect
the
provisions
of
18
u.
s.
c.
section
3651
relative
to
probation.
when
we
advert
to
3651,
we
find
that
language
provides,
while
on
probation
and
among
the
conditions
thereof,
the
defendant
maybe
required
to
pay
a
fine
in
one
or
several
sums
and
maybe
required
to
make
restitution
or
reparation.
now
i
understand
my
brother
to
concede
that
this
statutory
provision
that
permits
the
court
to
require
restitution
as
found
in
3651
eliminates
that
element
from
the
consideration
of
the
court
in
this
appeal.
i
submit
it
similarly
eliminates
from
this
court’s
consideration
or
its
contentions
that
a
fine
might
not
be
imposed.
i
think
probably
we
could
conclude
our
argument
at
this
point.
i
would
emphasize
that
the
letter
of
attorney
general
biddle,
as
the
court
has
suggested
in
its
questioning,
is
not
a
mere
letter,
but
it
is
a
letter
that
purports
to
communicate
to
the
congress
the
consensus
of
all
the
interested
persons
outside
of
the
legislature
that
were
considering
this
piece
of
legislation.
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
justice
including
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
the
parole
board,
i
think
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
fines
were
not
to
be
proscribed.
and
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
dorszynski
the
purpose
of
the
youth
corrections
act
is
indeed
to
afford
additional
sentencing
options
to
the
district
court.
we
submit
that
with
counsel’s
concession
and
with
that
view
of
the
statute
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
eminently
correct
as
indeed
it
was
in
oliver
--
mr.
ward
h.
mccree
mr.
mccree:
i
would
not
so
contend.
i
would
suggest
that
it
permits
the
imposition
of
a
fine
only
when
the
underlying
statute
calls
for
fine
and/or
imprisonment,
and
it
does
indeed
in
this
case.
mr.
ward
h.
mccree
no,
they
do
not
sentence
the
amount
of
that
provision
but
that
--
mr.
ward
h.
mccree
well,
3651
incorporates
the
offense
that
was
committed
that
brought
the
person
before
the
court
by
reason
of
the
indictment.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
the
government
will
submit
its
argument
at
this
point.
