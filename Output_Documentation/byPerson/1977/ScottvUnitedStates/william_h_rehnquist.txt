william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
of
the
cases
is
number
76-6767,
scott
against
united
states.
it
involves
criminal
convictions
which
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
government
agents
obtained
judicial
authorization
under
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968
to
conduct
a
wiretap,
at
a
residence
in
the
washington
dc
area
in
connection
with
the
suspected
drug
conspiracy.
the
agents
were
required
under
the
terms
of
both
of
the
statute
and
the
court
authorization
to
conduct
the
wiretap
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interception
of
communications
not
otherwise
subject
interception
under
title
iii.
during
a
one
month
period
the
agents
intercepted
virtually
all
conversations
over
the
tapped
phone.
on
petitioner's
motion
that
is
the
defendant
in
the
case,
the
district
court
ordered
the
suppression
of
all
intercepted
conversations
and
evidence
which
had
been
derived
from
those
conversations
relying
largely
on
the
fact
that
the
agents
had
in
his
opinion
made
no
attempt
to
comply
with
the
minimization
order.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
it
held
that
the
first
inquiry
should
not
have
been
the
subjective
intent
of
the
agents,
but
rather
the
reasonablenesses
measured
by
an
objective
standard
of
the
actual
interceptions
and
that
under
that
standard
there
was
no
statutory
or
constitutional
violation.
upon
remand
the
petitioners
were
convicted
on
the
substantive
offenses.
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
their
convictions
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
as
both
the
constitutional
and
statutory
matter,
the
first
step
in
evaluating
compliance
with
minimization
requirement,
like
evaluation
of
all
alleged
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
objectively
asses
the
agents
or
officers
conduct
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronting
at
the
time
without
regard
to
his
underlying
intent
or
motive.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
that
standard
in
correctly
concluded
that
neither
statutory
nor
constitutional
bounds
have
been
exceeded.
we
therefore
affirm
its
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
joins
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting.
