justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
inefficient,
the
supervision
was
inefficient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allen,
do
you
agree
that
every
call
is
intercepted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
that
seem
to
support
this
argument
that
there
was
no
discretionary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
the
every
single
call.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
fact
does
not
help
me,
because
if
you
take
a
baseball
bat
and
crack
a
man's
ear
and
look
at
it
and
find
dope,
that
justifies
cracking
the
skull.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
the
statute
says
use
some
discretion,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
here
they
used
none.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
not
that
tend
to
say
that
no
discretion
was
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
my
question.
it
is
the
one
call
here
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right,
it
is
lot
different
from
one
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
which
had
do
dope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
my
question
about
taking
off
anything,
my
question
involved
is
hitting
the
switch.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
in
the
world
did
they
put
this
provision
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
did
not
the
statute
say
that?
the
statute
does
not
say
that
does
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
we
should?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
that
where
you
turn
this
is
voice
on,
24
hours
a
day
for
30
days,
if
that
is
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
case
was
the
mayer's
wife
in
chicago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
a
twelve
year
old
had
called
an
abortion
clinic
and
before
you
answer
that,
you
know
this
is
what
we
did,
there
is
a
little
over
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
cannot
the
statute
say
that
if
you
found
the
proper
papers,
you
can
get
a
tap
on
any
person's
wire,
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
did
it,
would
not
it
be
equally
as
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
listened
to
everything,
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
have
listened
to
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
circumstance
was
that
whether
they
were
the
guilty
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
the
guilty
people,
is
that
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
judge
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
not
judge
anything
at
that
point.
they
have
got
the
order,
(inaudible).
do
you
think,
that
they
are
going
to
hear
everything,
would
they
be
listening
to
every
conversation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
in
the
case
you
are
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
more,
you
convince
me
that
this
should
not
have
put
that
in
statute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
trouble
is
that
congress
did
put
it
--
