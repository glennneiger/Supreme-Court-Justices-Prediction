chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
hear
arguments
next
in
scott
against
the
united
states.
mr.
shorter,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
court
requested
counsel
to
address
the
problem
of
standing,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
you
are
coming
to
this
but
let
me
put
it
to
you
know
once
it
is
determined
from
listening
that
approximately
one
third
of
the
calls
relate
to
not
narcotics
traffic,
does
not
that
have
some
--
give
some
impetus
to
continuing
surveillance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
third
of
the
conversations
relate
to
illegal
traffic
in
narcotics,
how
can
it
not
bear
on
the
continued
surveillance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
say
that
the
percentages
are
not
important,
but
what
percentage
of
the
total
calls
here
do
you
regard
as
unrelated
to
narcotics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
challenge
the
government's
analysis
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
go
about
minimizing
that
mr.
shorter,
once
you
have
found
that
40%
were
clearly
narcotics
related,
39%
were
so
ambiguous
they
could
not
tell
and
how
do
you
minimize
from
there
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
mr.
shorter,
you
must
be
aware
that
there
have
been
cases
where
conversations,
innocent
on
their
surface
were
conversations
in
code
related
to
illegal
activities.
that
is
a
familiar
phenomenon
in
this
business,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
new
codes
are
constantly
evolving,
are
they
not
and
it
takes
a
quite
a
bit
of
listening
before
they
can
identify
a
pattern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
mr.
shorter.
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
tell
us
that
every
call
intercepted
involved
on
one
end
of
the
line,
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
defendants
in
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yet
in
the
case
that
we
heard
a
several
years
ago,
the
evidence
showed
that
there
were
numerous
calls
to
the
tapped
number
where
the
person
answering
the
phone
was
not
the
person
residing
in
that
place,
but
someone
else
there
taking
orders
of
narcotics.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
one,
it
is
a
business
enterprise
as
in
the
narcotics
business
is,
that
would
not
be
unusual
to
have
some
relief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
are
applying
a
sort
of
probable
cause
test
that
when
the
babysitter
is
calling
her
boyfriend,
there
is
no
probable
cause
of
quotation
marks
to
believe
that
they
are
going
to
talk
about
narcotics,
is
that
it
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
put
in
quotation
marks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
stand
you
are
going
to
rely
on
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
