unknown
speaker
mr.
shorter,
the
statute
does
not
say,
that
you
have
to
eliminate
calls
not
related
to
criminal
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
not
use
the
words,
not
related
to
criminal
enterprise,
not
otherwise
subject
interception.
and
there's
also
a
subject
interception
because
the
court
order
authorized
it.
unknown
speaker
it
all
happened
during
the
30
day
period.
like
it
is
a
little
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well
its
also
to
authorize
the
intrusion.
unknown
speaker
they
listen
for
a
while
and
they
find
that
almost
one
out
of
every
two
calls
has
an
evidence
of
criminality
in
it.
when
are
they
supposed
to
stop
listening?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
as
if
they
were
not
going
to
listen
to
lawyer
client
calls,
the
occupation
calls
and
(inaudible)
calls.
unknown
speaker
what
else
should
he
have
told
them?
unknown
speaker
some
of
which
contained
reference
to
criminal
activity.
unknown
speaker
well
the
government
says
that
it
did.
it
said
two
or
three
of
them
referred
to
--
unknown
speaker
did
not
she
say
that,
we
do
not
talk
about
business
on
the
phone
to
--
unknown
speaker
because
its
almost
impossible
to
minimize
a
call
for
the
weather
because
by
that
time
you
finished
getting
the
reports,
it
would
take
you
that
long
to
hold
the
plug
out.
unknown
speaker
but
what
else
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
the
agent
lee
did
not
test
one--
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
a
reasonable
explanation
mr.
shorter?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
getting
out
is
this
mr.
shorter,
is
it
not
also
a
pattern
in
the
cases
of
this
kind
over
the
years,
that
the
first
five,
seven
or
10
minutes
of
the
conversation
is
about
the
weather
or
cooking
recipes
or
going
fishing
and
then
it
turns
to
discussion
of
narcotics
orders
either
in
coded
terms
or
in
open
terms.
is
that
not
a
common
pattern?
unknown
speaker
and
must
not
the
agent
on
that
wiretap
taken
into
account
that
while
they
are
talking
about
the
weather
or
something
else
that
if
you
listened
long
enough
they
will
be
moving
to
the
main
topic
of
the
narcotics
business.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
other
one
would
be
a
frame
up
or
something?
unknown
speaker
would
they
are
used
to
having
you
tap
somebody's
phone
that
you
most
of
the
time
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
is
answering
the
phone
to
take
orders.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
allen,
supposing
the
judge's
order
had
left
out
any
command
to
minimize
and
said,
go
ahead
and
intercept
everything
and
then
they
would
intercept
it
one
a
bit
proper,
would
that
have
been
a
proper
way?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
violation
of
minimization
order
written
in
the
words
of
the
statute
that
would
result
in
suppression?
unknown
speaker
the
agent
says,
(inaudible)
and
we
have
been
listening
to
that
and
it
was
not
the
lawyer,
it
was
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
let
me
go
back
to
your
twelve
year
old
babysitter,
would
you
say
they
should
not
listen
to
the
first
conversation
of
babysitter?
your
example
of
the
illness
by
the
other
person
and
listen
two
or
three
kinds
and
decided
that
had
done
it
by
the
pattern.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
have
a
twelve
year
old
answer
the
phone
and
they
develop
a
pattern,
i
mean
the
twelve
year
answer
the
phone,
talk
to
her
couple
of
minutes
and
then
turn
the
phone
over
to
the
parents
who
are
going
to
talk
about
drugs
and
how
are
you
going
to
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
say
that
as
soon
as
we
hear
a
minute
of
juvenile
conversation,
we
turn
it
off.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
32
year
old
babysitter.
unknown
speaker
plus
there
is
a
way
to
read
this
statute
mr.
allen,
a
question
while
ago
by
my
brother
stevens
indicated
that
would
make
it
both
semantically
meaningless
as
well
as
practically
meaningless
because
the
statute
says
--
imposes
an
obligation
to
conduct
the
surveillance
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interception
of
communications
not
otherwise
subject
to
interception
under
this
chapter
and
all
the
communications
are
otherwise
subject
to
interception
under
this
chapter
under
the
court
order.
unknown
speaker
yeah
everything
except
evidentiary
privileged
conversation.
unknown
speaker
no,
in
fact,
dramatically
that
is
the
way
to
read
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
an
argument.
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
permitted
or
not
that
you
are
investigating
people
who
are
going
to
be
potential
defendants
in
a
criminal
trial,
presumably
they
make
him
up
with
some
kind
of
an
alibi,
or
they
may
come
up
with
stories
that
would
try
to
explain
ambiguous
transactions
that
even
though
a
particular
conversation
is
not
crime
related
may
give
you
information
in
the
nature
of
a
diary
or
something
about
the
trial
that
would
help
you
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
including
impeaching
evidents,
potentially
impeaching
evidents.
unknown
speaker
foreseeing
a
possible
defense
at
a
criminal
trial
such
as
in
alibi
if
he
says
i
was
vesting
--
my
mother
at
2
o'
clock
through
the
afternoon,
you
could
say
well
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
were
on
the
telephone
talking
to
your
butcher.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
you
generally
do
not
know
what
a
person
is
going
to
say
by
way
of
alibi,
until
the
trial
begins.
