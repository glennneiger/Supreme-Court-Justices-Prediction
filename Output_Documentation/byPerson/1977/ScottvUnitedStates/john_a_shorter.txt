mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
minimization
provision
of
title
three
and
on
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
1968
provides
that
every
order
and
extension
thereof
authorizing
an
electronic
surveillance
shall
contain
the
provision
that
the
authorization
to
intercept
shall
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interception
of
communication
not
otherwise
subject
to
interception
under
this
chapter.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
yes
there
are
three
questions
really
before
the
court
in
this
appeal.
first
one,
is
the
meaning
and
interpretation
and
and
construction
of
the
minimization
provision
of
federal
wiretap
statute.
we
feel
that
specifically
question
is
whether
the
court
below
determined
the
correct
standard
and
properly
applied
to
conduct
of
the
wiretap
in
this
case.
related
questions
also
implicated,
one
is
as
the
scope
of
the
remedy
to
be
applied
in
the
event
of
a
violation
of
minimization
requirement
and
that
is
whether
full
or
partial
suppression
of
the
fruits
of
the
wiretap
to
be
mandated
and
thirdly
whether
the
petition
has
got
standing
to
assert
the
violation.
the
standing
question
that
relates
only
to
the
petition
of
scott
within
the
framework
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
is
a
related
petition
for
writ
of
cert
also
arising
from
the
circuit
court
of
opinion
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
petition
for
chloe
v.
daviage
and
of
course
per
situation
on
the
question
of
standing
is
same
as
that
of
the
petition
of
scott.
question
of
standing
was
fully
briefed
in
this
miss
daviage's
petition
in
her
brief
as
amicus
and
we
of
course
have
fully
researched
in
brief,
the
point
of
standing
in
our
brief.
i
would
say
that
in
suffice
standing,
we
think
that
the
question
was
adequately
and
correctly
answered
by
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
balosi
(ph)
case
which
was
also
an
appeal
from
a
wiretap
ruling
of
the
district
court
and
similarly
in
the
earlier
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
referred
to
as
scott
1,
the
direct
appeal
in
this
case
is
from
what
is
referred
to
through
out
the
briefs
of
the
parties
as
scott
2
but
in
scott
1
the
circuit
court
fully
addressed
the
question
standing
and
it
determined
that
under
the
court’s
interpretation
of
the
related
provisions
of
title
3,
the
petitioner
scott
clearly
had
standing
to
assert
the
violation
of
the
minimization
requirement.
we
feel
that
was
the
correct
analysis
of
the
court’s
analysis
of
the
question
was
a
correct
one
and
certainly
the
court’s
conclusion
of
we
feel
was
amply
justified
by
the
language
of
the
statue
which
identifies
a
grieved
person
whose
as
one
whose
conversations
are
intercepted
over
the
wiretap
and
secondly
one
against
whom
the
interception
is
directed,
on
both
questions,
on
both
points
the
petitioner
scott
qualifies.
the
petitioner
scott
was
identified
in
the
application
for
the
wiretap,
that
is
the
affidavit
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drug
agent
who
applied
for
the
wiretap
as
being
one
of
the
principal
targets.
though
the
order
that
was
entered
by
the
court
in
response
to
this
application
did
not
identify
scott
particularly
as
one
of
the
subjects.
the
order
said
that
the
targets
of
the
investigation
that
the
wiretap
was
authorized
to
intercept
the
conversation
of
bernis
thurmon,
alfonso
lee
and
others,
and
of
course,
for
one
to
determine
who
the
others
might
be
and
so
far
as
what
the
record
would
show
at
that
point,
there
were
nine
persons
identified
in
the
application,
it
being
the
principal
offender.
scott
was
certainly
a
principal
target
of
the
investigation.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
the
entire
question
of
minimization
is
a
very
difficult
one,
it
cannot
be
resolved
we
feel
by
reference
to
percentages
of
narcotic
related
call.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
not
the
question
of
minimization.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
we
feel
that
the
question
of
minimization
is
related
to
a
number
of
factors,
the
least
one
of
which
we
would
urge
would
be
the
percentage
of
narcotic
related
calls.
for
instance,
it
would
seriously
relate
to
who
it
is
who
might
use
the
phone,
whether
or
not
that
has
been
developed
over
the
course
of
the
wiretap,
a
pattern
of
clearly
innocent
calls
between
certain
people
who
talk
on
the
phone
and--
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
we
did
not
undertake
an
identification
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
a
percentile
breakdown.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
what
we
relied
on
was
the
testimony
of
the
agent
who
supervised
the
wiretap
that
the
perception
of
the
agents
who
were
listening
to
the
wiretap
and
the
reports
that
were
made
to
him
and
reports
that
he
in
turn
forwarded
to
the
attorney
in
charge
of
the
wiretap
that
roughly
40%
of
the
calls
were
narcotic
related,
this
was
his
testimony.
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
that
was
held
in
the
district
court
in
april
of
1971.
judge
widey
(ph)
,
the
judge
who
presided
at
that
particular
hearing
adopted
that
finding
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
made
it
the
basis
of
the
ruling
that
he
ultimately
entered
suppressing
the
wiretap
that
though
there
was
testimony
that
40%
of
the
calls
were
narcotic
related,
60%
of
the
calls
were
not.
there
was
no
effort,
absolutely
no
effort
made
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
agents
conducting
the
wiretap
to
minimize
the
interception
of
any
telephone
call.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
well,
when
we
say
that
some
of
the
calls
were
so
ambiguous
that
they
could
not
be
--
that
you
could
not
tell
what
they
related
to,
we
think
that
is
the
determination
that
was
made
by
mr.
kellogg,
our
adversary
indicates,
the
agents
who
compiled
daily
records
and
reports
of
the
calls
that
were
being
made
over
the
telephone,
using
their
own
judgment,
using
their
own
instincts
referring
to
the
logs
of
the
calls
that
they
created
at
the
time
that
the
calls
were
made,
passing
the
information
along
to
mr.
cooper,
the
supervising
agent.
mr.
cooper
was
reviewing
their
logs,
he
was
reviewing
their
reports
and
as
the
reports
were
going
in,
some
days
would
be
three
out
of
six
calls
were
narcotic
related,
some
days
would
be
3
out
of
19
calls.
so
that
at
the
end
when
we
totaled
up
the
number
of
calls
that
were
intercepted
and
incidentally
all
the
calls
on
this
particular
telephone
were
intercepted
over
30
day
period,
with
no
effort,
with
no
phone
call
ever
being
not
recorded
and
not
heard
by
the
agents.
when
you
got
to
the
end
of
the
line,
there
was
some
compilation
that
mr.
cooper
testified
to
and
that
was
that
well
our
conclusion
was
if
40%
of
the
calls
were
narcotic
related
that
was
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
it
was
not
the
matter
of
percentages
although
percentages
were
important
because
a
majority
of
the
calls
were
not
related
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
agents
to
the
narcotic
enterprise.
they
were
not
narcotic
related
conversations.
now,
there
were
instances
of
calls
being
made
over
the
phone
which
were
challenged
in
the
district
court
as
being
subject
to
some
reasonable
effort
at
minimization
and
the
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
we
submit,
it
creates
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
agents
to
conduct
the
wiretap
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
to
conduct
the
wiretap
in
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interception
of
calls
not
related
to
the
criminal
enterprise.
and
in
fact
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
so
the
statute
creates
a
responsibility
on
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
assistant
who
is
supervising
the
tap,
the
supervising
agent
and
the
agents
who
are
actually
doing
the
intercept.
but
even
above
that
it
creates
a
responsibility.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
no,
it
says
it
shall
minimize.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
all
calls
in
that
subject
interception.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
it
seems
to
be
that
way
but
clearly
if
we
are
going
to
use
as
our
starting
point.
what
this
court
said
in
berger,
and
what
this
court
said
in
katz.
we
would
also
use
our
starting
point
the
overwriting
and
then
compelling
interest
of
privacy
that
must
govern
any
approach
to
questions
of
wiretapping.
this
is
an
intrusion
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
limit
the
intrusion.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
it
authorizes
an
intrusion.
on
a
very
particularized
and
a
very
limited
basis
and
for
very
limited
reasons.
and
the
reasons
are
to
gather
evidence
of
criminality.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
purpose
for
which
the
wiretap
is
authorized.
the
wiretap
is
not
authorized.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
well
it
is
a
judgment
that
has
to
be
formed
by
the
officers
who
are
conducting
the
wire
tap.
first
of,
they
must
a
design
on
a
desire
to
follow
the
law.
in
this
case,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
agents.
that
they
are
intercepting
every
call
was
done
willfully
and
was
in
violation
of
order
simply
because
the
supervising
agent
did
not
clearly
instruct
the
agents
as
to
what
their
responsibilities
were.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
yes,
once
they
were
obviously
privileged.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
well,
he
should
have
told
them
that
in
the
instance,
well,
after
looking
at
the
telephone
calls
between
geneva
thornton
and
her
mother
that
proceeded
for
several
days.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
that
is
an
error
because
the
only
thing
the
government
can
say
about
any
of
the
conversations
between
geneva
jenkins
and
her
mother
was
that
in
one
of
the
conversations,
the
second
conversation,
this
is
the
mother
said
to
geneva,
i'll
call.
and
she
also
said
something
about
a
person
named
ray.
in
response
of
question
that
geneva's
mother
asked
about
bernis
thurmon,
the
man
whom
she
was
living
with,
where
is
bernis
and
she
said
that
bernis
is
out
taking
care
of
business.
that
is
the
gist
of
what
the
government
points
to
--.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
well
that
is
the
mother
in
a
later
conversation.
when
the
mother
said
geneva
has
something
very
important
to
tell
you.
this
is
another
conversation.
this
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
this
conversation
about
bernis,
taking
care
of
business
which
is
what
geneva
said
to
her
mother,
when
her
mother
said,
well
where
is
bernis.
this
is
her
common
law
husband.
this
is
just
like
any
mother
in
law
would
say
well
where
is
your
husband,
when
he's
out,
taking
care
of
business
whatever
that
maybe.
but
that
is
not
a
narcotic
related
conversation
and
the
conversation
that
you
are
now
referring
to
was
a
later
conversation
where
the
mother
was
saying
to
geneva,
there
is
something
important
that
i
want
to
say
to
you.
all
the
conversations
are
deeply
personal.
this
is
a
mother
talking
to
her
daughter,
urging
her
daughter
to
leave
the
man
that
she's
living
with,
bring
you
close
and
as
a
conversation
go
on
they
become,
the
personal
nature
of
them
is
quite
obvious.
the
mother
says
to
geneva,
there
is
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about.
now
who
knows
what
it
is
about.
i
would
submit
that
was
something
personal.
and
geneva
said,
well
what
is
it.
the
mother
said,
well
it
is
something
about
business
and
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
business
over
telephone.
agent
cooper
during
the
first
hearing
admitted
that
the
agents
had
no
reason
to
believe,
no
suspicion
that
the
mother
was
involved
in
any
narcotics
related
activity.
well,
this
was
clearly
what
it
obviously
was
a
mother
talking
to
her
daughter,
having
battering
types
of
conversations
about
family
matters
and
other
personal
matters.
later,
in
the
hearing
that
took
place
a
couple
of
years
later,
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed
judge
widey
for
the
first
time.
his
testimony
took
a
slightly
different
view,
and
that
was
that
after
reading
the
transcript
of
the
seven
geneva-mother
telephone
calls,
he
believes
that
there
was
a
basis
for
a
suspicion
that
the
mother
knew
something
about
the
narcotic
enterprise,
which
i
would
submit
is
not
a
basis
to
intercept
conversations
between
even
a
person
accused
of
crime,
the
mother,
which
is
what
it
amounted
to.
there
was
a
call
that
geneva
made
to
the
abortion
clinic,
or
i
believe
it
was
an
abortion
clinic.
the
agents
justified
intercepting
that
call
because
they
did
not
know
who
she
was
going
to
talk
to
when
she
called
there.
it
did
not
occur
to
them
perhaps
that
this
might
be
a
strictly
confidential
personal
medical
matter
but
they
intercepted
the
call
and
they
justified
it
on
the
grounds,
that
well
she
might
have
been
calling
over
there,
making
some
inquiry
about
some
narcotics.
the
pattern
of
the
calls
in
this
transcript
were
geneva
jenkins
did
not
call
people
about
narcotics,
to
place
orders
for
narcotics
or
solicit
customers
for
narcotics,
she
received
calls
that
were
made
to
the
phone
for
her
husband,
that
was
the
pattern.
the
clear
pattern
in
this
case,
after
examining
the
transcripts
was
that
there
were
certain
periods
during
the
day,
particularly
at
night,
i
believe
from
midnight
until
6
in
the
morning,
when
i
think
there
were
over
the
30
day
period,
there
might
have
been
an
average
of
maybe
one
call
per
day
from
those
particular
hours
and
the
question
was
put
to
the
officers.
well,
did
you
not
consider
cutting
off
the
wiretap,
minimizing
the
intrusion
at
least
during
the
night
time
period,
and
it
never
occurred
to
them.
another
thing
that
was
pointed
out,
every
call
that
was
made
from
that
phone,
whether
it
be
for
time,
whether
mr.
thurmon
wanted
to
know
what
time
of
the
day
it
was,
what
the
weather
was.
these
calls
were
without
any
qualification
totally
intercepted.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
no
it
isn't,
no.
thats
not
correct.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
right
and
there
came
a
time
and
they
also
testified
to
it
where
after
listening
to
the
calls
between
bernis
and
some
of
the
other
alleged
co-conspirators,
they
got
to
know
the
code
that
these
individuals
were
using
fairly
well.
like
one
of
the
guys
would
always
call
and
say,
well
put
me
on
3rd
st.
or
put
me
on
4th
st.
meet
me
on
5th
st.
he
has
always
used
a
numerical
reference
to
a
street.
he
was
not
raising
for
any
meeting
at
5th
st.
he
was
telling
bernis
that
he
wanted
5
units
of
narcotics.
well,
this
was
commonly
known
to
the
agents.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
right,
i
would
agree
that
that
is
so
but
these
people
using
this
telephone
were
wedded
to
their
endemic
language.
most
of
the
agents
in
this
case
has
participated
in
an
earlier
wiretap
that
had
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia
during
the
the
summer,
the
proceeding
summer.
so
they
were
familiar
with
street
language
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
were
also
familiar
by
reason
of
having
tapped
to
telephone
involving
some
spanish
speaking
people,
within
the
year
proceeding
--utilized
in
this
tab
that
what
the
codes
were.
there
was
no
problem
about
identifying
the
language
and
the
codes
that
were
used
by
the
people
in
this
case
and
that
of
course
is
not
what
argument
about
minimization
deals
with.
we
say
this
that
when
a
person
became
identified
as
an
alleged
co-conspirators,
and
first
of
all
we
have
to
remember
of
the
scope
of
the
operation
that
this
wire
tap
reveal
despite
what
was
set
forth
in
the
affidavit,
the
operation
in
this
case
was
a
retail
distribution
set
up
and
when
i
say
a
retail,
it
was
purely
a
local
distribution
by
one
person
and
two
lieutenants,
small
units
of
narcotics,
people
who
would
either
resell
or
use
them.
in
this
case
it
became
very
questionable
because
some
of
the
people
who
were
ultimately
charged
were
drug
users
and
they
bought
in
small
amounts.
that
was
the
scope
of
the
enterprise
in
this
case.
and
after
a
period
of
time,
the
same
people
were
calling
day
in
and
day
out
ordering
small
quantities
of
narcotics.
the
government
had
every
justification
in
intercepting
calls
between
the
people
who
were
identified
as
ordering
narcotics
over
the
telephone
and
there
were
justified
in
intercepting
the
conversations
of
new
people
until
such
time
as
they
would
get
some
understanding
of
what
these
people
might
be
calling
about.
what
we
complain
about,
its
clearly
set
forth,
that
in
the
management
of
this
wire
tap
the
supervision
was
not
precise,
it
was
not
correct,
though
there
were
--
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
the
supervision
was
inefficient.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
no
that
is
not
enough.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
well,
what
you
have
is
that
not
only
was
the
supervision
inefficient
but
the
activities
of
the
agent
was
not
self
correcting
in
terms
of
that
inefficiency.
the
agents
just
ran
and
open
wiretap
in
this
case.
they
seized
every
conversations
without
regard
to
the
minimization
requirement.
every
conversation
except,
for
when
the
wiretap
was
broken
or
it
was
attached
to
the
wrong
telephone.
their
instructions
about
lawyer
clients
conversation
was
this.
this
is
what
agent
cooper
supervisor
said,
if
there
is
a
conversation
between
an
attorney
and
the
lawyer
calls
there,
somebody
at
that
phone
calls
the
lawyer,
listen
to
the
conversation
and
learn
whether
they
are
talking
about
a
pending
case.
listen
to
the
conversation,
then
report
the
conversation
to
mr.
sullivan
who
was
a
supervising
attorney,
then
mr.
sullivan
would
decide
what
to
do
next,
and
it
goes
very
fuzzy
then.
fortunately
there
were
no
attorney
conversations
intercepted
over
this
telephone.
but
the
conversation
to
the
abortion
clinic
was
intercepted,
telephone
call
from
the
bank
to
mr.
thurmon
was
intercepted.
calls
relating
to
the
time,
the
weather
and
to
return
to
the
questions
it
was
asked
me
about
--
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
it
conceivably
did
not
hurt
anyone,
it
was
only
indicative,
it
did
not
hurt
anyone,
it
was
only
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
agents
decided
to
just
intercept
all
the
telephone.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
but
the
realization
was,
and
this
was
sensed
by
the
agents
that
perhaps
they
should
have
exercised
some
caution,
they
should
have
implemented
some
plan
of
minimization
because
when
they
were
asked
as
why
they
seized
the
conversations
about
the
weather
and
time
and
whatever,
the
officer's
answer
was,
well,
we
listened
to
the
conversation
because
we
were
afraid
that
right
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
they
would
doubt
someone
else
and
they
would
start
a
narcotics
conversation.
that
was
their
justification,
not
that
well
these
conversations
do
not
hurt
anyone.
they
offered
another
reason
which
was
totally
false.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
not
when
you
have
a
pin
registered
device.
they
had
a
touch
tone
decoder
that
at
the
time
that
the
telephone
number
was
dialed,
as
soon
as
did
the
touch
tone,
at
every
plunk
of
every
number
that
the
caller
makes
the
number
flashes
on
a
board
that
is
sitting
right
before
the
person
who
is
running
the
intercept.
he
can
see
ti
port
2525.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
in
the
management
of
some
voice
chats,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
shorter,
jr.
yes.
this
frequently
happens
but
we
are
speaking
about
a
mandated
part
of
a
statute
that
requires
minimization.
what
does
minimization
mean.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
agents
cannot
intercept
telephone
calls,
it
doesn't
mean
that
at
all.
it
does
not
mean
that
agents
must
eliminate
certain
calls.
it
means
that
the
agents
have
to
be
responsive
to
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
is
taking
place
and
fashion
in
good
faith.
that
is
the
key
here,
fashion
in
good
faith.
some
approach
to
the
wiretapping,
that
is
going
to
take
place.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
supervising
agent,
the
supervising
attorney
and
the
agents
to
formulate
some
plan
as
to
how
the
wiretap
is
going
to
be
managed.
their
illustrations
throughout
the
cases,
that
show
that
agents
and
officers,
supervising
attorneys
were
sensitive
to
the
invasion,
the
intrusion
that
is
going
to
take
place
do
in
good
faith,
fashion
such
plans.
and
the
plan
that
it
consists
of
something
more
that
if
a
lawyer
gets
on
the
phone,
listened
to
his
conversation
and
report
it
and
it
consists
of
something
more
than
saying,
well
if
an
attorney,
i
mean,
if
there's
a
doctor-patient
conversation
do
not
record
that
off
the
priest
calls
and
the
caller
wants
to
make
a
confession
over
the
telephone,
do
not
record
that.
i
am
speaking
about
something
that
is
more
practical,
more
meaningful,
something
more
workable
than
just
that
kind
of
a
direction
to
the
agent.
the
law
requires
it
and
the
law
requires
that
the
government
agents,
formulate
some
reasonable
approach
to
the
wiretapping
that
they
were
about
to
do.
and
that
means
in
this
particular
case,
some
analysis
and
early
analysis
of
the
telephone
calls
between
geneva
and
her
mother.
and
particularly
other
phone
calls
between
geneva
and
people
that
you
were
talking.
there
is
an
instance
where
she
had
a
conversation
with
i
believe
is
the
woman
called
gloria's
mother,
clearly
a
very
banal
conversation.
but
the
transcript
of
this
case
reflects
that
when
agent
cooper
was
asked
about
whether
any
thought
was
given
to
minimizing,
that
is
reducing
the
interception
of
the
calls
between
geneva
and
her
mother.
his
answer
was
well,
he
was
asked
to
articulate
it
in
terms
of
the
guidelines,
this
attorney
client
guideline,
he
said,
well
the
guidelines
that
we
receive
and
as
we
apply
them
to
the
case,
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
frivolous
conversations.
it
dealt
with
the
attorney
client
conversation.
so
his
answer
in
effect
was
that,
whatever
geneva
and
her
mother
were
talking
about
that
was
frivolous.
so,
it
is
alright
if
we
intercept
that.
our
guidelines
concerned
itself
with
attorney
client
relationships,
doctor-patient
and
that
kind
of
conversation.
