mr.
richard
a.
allen
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
shorter
today
is
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
the
ticket
or
interceptions
in
this
case
that
has
not
reflected
in
either
of
the
briefs
in
the
case.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
shorter
has
suggested,
it
seemed
to
me
in
his
argument,
a
standard
of
what
the
government
should
have
done
to
reflect
exactly
what
the
government
did
in
this
case.
as
i
understood
his
argument.
he
said
that
when
you
have
a
converse,
when
you
are
listening
to
a
conversation
which
involves
a
known
party
to
the
conspiracy,
the
government
has
reason
to
listen
to
it.
and
he
went
on
to
say
and
by
the
way
would
emphasize
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
every
conversation
that
was
intercepted,
one
of
the
parties
to
the
conversation
was
either
petitioner
thurmon
or
his
girlfriend
geneva
jenkins
who
was
the
co-defendant
in
this
case
and
now
both
known
conspirators,
participants
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
shorter
went
on
to
suggest
that
indeed
when
a
conversation
takes
place
between
a
known
participant
and
a
stranger
to
the
agents,
it
is
reasonable
for
the
agents
to
listen
to
that
conversation.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
want
to
get
into
an
analysis
of
each
particular
calls,
that
concession
would
cover
about
95%
of
them
including
the
calls
he
mentioned
in
his
argument.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes
your
honor,
except
for
a
short
period
of
time
when
the
agents
apparently
in
a
firm
they
hooked
up
to
the
wrong
phone
and
we
do
not
know
how
many
calls
were
made
during
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
not,
i
think
all
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
but
i
think
all
it
reflects
is
that
it
was
reasonable
to
intercept
every
single
call.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
for
a
number
of
reasons
among
other
things,
the
agents
at
the
time
and
after
the
fact
that
seems
to
be
truth
that
40%
of
the
calls
were
clearly
narcotic
related
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well
your
honor,
we
are
not
engaging
in
that
kind
of
an
analysis.
we
are
trying
to
decide
whether
it
is
reasonable
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
your
honor,
here
they
intercepted
every
call.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
think
it
does,
there
is
a
fundamental
logical
fallacy
in
that
conclusion
which
is
one
that
the
district
court
engaged
in.
in
other
words,
consider
the
simplest
case
where
all
they
have
intercepted
is
one
call
and
it
is
a
clearly
narcotics
related
call.
now,
would
you
say
in
that
case
that
that
evidence,
the
agent
has
not
used
any
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
are
384
calls,
all
of
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
all
of
which
in
our
analysis
indicates.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
not
all
of
which
had
to
do
with
dope,
but
all
of
which
were
reasonably
intercepted
on
the
anticipation
that
they
might
have
something
do
to
with
those.
with
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
weather
calls
stand
by
themselves
and
i
understand
there
were
very
few
of
those,
perhaps
five
or
six,
they
were
perhaps
20
calls
to
find
out
what
time
it
was
which
is
about
a
five
minute
call
and
the
agent
has
barely
time
to
turn
off
the
machine.
the
weather
calls
are
again,
very
short
calls
and
the
agents,
it
is
our
position
that
the
agents
were
not
unreasonable
in
concluding
that
listening
to
a
very
short
weather
call
where
by
the
time
you
head
off
your
headphones
and
turn
off
the
machine,
the
call
is
going
to
be
over,
the
agents
that
seems
to
us
are
reasonable
in
concluding
that
when
they
want
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
it's
more
–
to
even
turning
off
the
recorder
by
the
time,
by
the
time
they
reach
over
to
turn
off
the
recorder
to
call
us
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
put
the
provision
in
the
statute
and
we
have
gone
for
a
moment,
literally
the
importance
of
the
privilege.
they
put
the
provision
in
the
statute
to
accommodate
during
important
individual
interest
and
privacy.
listening
to
a
recorded
weather
call
that
anyone
can
listen
to
simply
does
not
infringe
upon
anyone's
privacy
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
statute
did
not
purport
to
enumerate
all
of
the
infinite
circumstances
in
which
--
the
infinite
kinds
of
call
which
an
agent
might
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
look
in
and
see
whether
conduct
of
the
agents
was
reasonable
and
whether
it
violated
the
kinds
of
things
the
statute
was
designed
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
okay
your
honor,
if
all
of
the
calls
that
came
through
when
they
were
listening
to,
they
had
reasonable
grounds
to
listening
to.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
one
of
the
--
either
bernis
thurmon
who
is
the
petitioner
or
his
girlfriend
who
is
a
co-defendant
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
in
cases
where
you
hear
him,
it
is
–
you
have
greater
reason
to
listen
to
his
conversation
or
some
greater
portion
of
it,
than
you
do
when
you
listen
to
as
a
ten
year
old
daughter.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
do
not
recall
the
case
right
offhand
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
one
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
that
seems
to
us
that
that
is
something
an
agent
can
reasonably
take
in
to
account,
but
in
any
event,
in
this
case,
the
agents
from
the
beginning
knew
that
petitioner
thurmon
was
the
target
of
the
tap
and
after
a
few
days
they
knew
that
his
girlfriend
was
taking
orders
on
phone.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
as
we
have
been
discussing
is
whether
the
agents
violated
the
minimization
requirements
in
judge
smith's
orders.
now,
as
i
understand
petitioner's
arguments,
the
argument
is
essentially
as
follows
that
the
minimization
requirement
of
the
statute
imposes
a
two
pronged
test,
both
of
which
must
be
met
for
any
interception
is
lawful.
the
first
prong
is
according
to
the
petitioners
that
the
agents
engaged
in
what
they
call
good-faith
efforts
at
minimization
and
the
second
prong
is
that
the
interceptions
be
objectively
reasonable.
although
they
also
assert
that
the
interceptions
in
this
case
were
not
objectively
reasonable,
they
have
relied
almost
exclusively
on
the
argument
that
there
were
no
good-faith
efforts
in
this
case
to
minimize.
our
response
to
their
argument
about
good
faith
efforts
is
two-fold,
we
have
two
independent
responses.
our
first
position
is
a
legal
position,
that
the
alleged
good-faith
or
the
lack
of
good-faith,
subjected
good-faith
of
the
agents
conducting
an
interception
is
not
a
determining
factor
in
deciding
whether
they
have
complied
with
a
statute
and
the
minimization
orders.
our
second
position
is
a
factual
position
and
that
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
simply
does
not
support
the
claim
that
the
agents
in
this
case
had
bad
faith
or
subjectively
intended
to
violate
the
provisions
of
judge
smith's
orders
including
the
minimization
provision.
now,
the
first
issue
which
is
legal
issue
has
importance
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
and
should
be
discussed
first
if
not
principally.
legal
question
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
seems
to
us
can
best
be
put
in
focus
by
considering
the
simplest
case.
you
have
agents
who
obtain
a
court
order
to
intercept
conversations
based
on
probable
cause,
the
john
smith,
the
owner
of
the
telephone,
the
subscriber
to
the
telephone
is
engaging
in
his
narcotics
business
over
that
telephone
and
they
obtain
a
court
order
not
the
court
order
provides
pursuant
to
the
statute
that
the
interception
should
be
conducted
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interception
of
conversations
not
otherwise
subject
of
the
statute.
the
order
said
is
for
five
days
and
during
that
period
there
is
one
call
that
comes
over
the
phone
and
that
is
a
call
from
john
smith
and
he
starts
right
off
talking
about
his
narcotics
business
and
they
listen
to
it
and
they
intercept.
now,
suppose
later
on
there
is
a
suppression
hearing
and
agent
testifies
that
his
supervisor
instructed
him
to
listen
to
everything
that
came
over
the
line.
now,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position,
they
would
contend
that
the
interception
of
that
call
which
we
would
submit
is
clearly
reasonable,
is
nevertheless
unlawful
because
the
agent
who
intercepted
it
would
probably
have
intercepted
some
other
call
that
was
never
made
in
different
circumstances.
now,
it
is
our
position,
that
is
our
central
position
that
there
is
simply
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
in
general
principles
of
search
and
seizure
law
for
that
position.
we
can
not
see
any
basis
for
arguing
that
that
agent
in
my
example
failed
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
“to
minimize
the
interception
of
communications
not
otherwise
subject
to
interception.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it
would
because
the
statute
provides
as
one
of
the
ground
for
suppression,
the
allegation
that
the
order
is
defective
on
its
face
and
in
your
hypothetical
the
order
would
be
defective
on
its
face.
in
other
words,
the
interception
that
resulted
from
that
order
would
have
resulted
from
an
effect
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
suppose
for
instance,
the
agents
have
an
order
to
investigate
my
john
smith
example,
and
he
is
out
one
night
and
he
has
a
twelve
year
babysitter
and
she
makes
a
call
to
her
boyfriend
and
the
agents
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
she
has
anything
to
do
or
any
knowledge
with
the
operation,
but
nevertheless
(inaudible)
by
happen
stance,
the
babysitter
says,
“well,
you
know
my
boss
mr.
smith
left
some
narcotics
over
here.”
we
would
admit
that
in
that
circumstance,
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
agent
to
listen
to
the
conversation
and
the
evidence
that
happened
to
develop
from
it
ought
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
would
not
put
the
word,
i
would
not
put
that
label
problem
was
cause
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
would
prefer
to
use
the
word,
they
had
no
reasonable
expectation
that
their
interception
would
be
relevant
or
the
conversation
would
be
relevant.
as
i
say
our
position
is
fundamentally
that
good-faith
and
lack
of
good-faith
can
not
be
relevant
consideration,
it
is
true
under
the
statute
and
it
is
true
as
a
general
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
if
a
twelve
year
old
in
my
example
had
called
an
abortion
clinic,
the
agent
would
have
improperly
intercepted
it.
if
geneva
jenkins
who
is
a
co-defendant
and
a
participant
in
the
conspiracy
had
made
a
call
to
some
organization
that
had
never
come
up
in
the
tap
before,
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
agents
to
listen
to
her
short
conversation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
if
the
statute
said
that
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
listened
to
everything
in
circumstances
that
made
listening
to
everything
reasonable.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
circumstances
that
made
it
reasonable.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
no
your
honor,
the
guilty
reason
–
the
reason
was
that
the
conversations
they
were
listening
to
were
either
narcotics
related,
but
they
were
always
by
somebody
who
was
involved
in
the
conspiracy
and
they
were
either
narcotics
related,
there
they
were
sufficiently
ambiguous
to
give
the
agent
summaries
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
agent
cooper
who
was
the
primary
witness
in
the
suppression
hearing,
testified
that
he
conducted
this
interception
on
the
same
basis
that
he
conducted
another
interception
recently,
and
he
said
that
for
instance,
in
that
interception
we
had
a
case
where
two
people,
a
woman
who
is
talking
over
the
phone
would
always
call
her
friend
and
when
she
called
a
particular
friend,
she
would
always
talk
about
her
illness.
well,
after
a
time
or
two
of
that,
we
stopped
intercepting
that
kind
of
conversation,
i
mean
we
had
developed
he
reason
to
believe
that
the
interception
of
that
conversation
would
not
help
our
investigation.
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
reasonable
way
to
go
about
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
in
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
this
case
it
was
clear
that
one
thing
they
were
going
to
listen
to
calls
to
lawyer.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
told
the
judge
implicitly,
they
told
the
judge
when
they
applied
to
the
order,
that
they
wanted
an
order
to
intercept
conversations
that
contained
information
about
the
narcotics
conspiracy,
implicitly
they
told
the
judge
that
they
would
act
reasonably
which
in
our
view
they
did.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
would
depend
on
the
circumstances,
the
thing
for
me
the
first
as
a
general
presumption,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
conversation
between
a
twelve
year
old
babysitter
and
her
thirteen
year
old
boyfriend,
it
seems
to
me
although
their
maybe
circumstances
to
the
contrary
that
that
kind
of
conversation
is
not
going
to
be
relevant.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
i
think,
in
some
circumstances
it
maybe
reasonable
to
listen
to
a
juvenile's
conversation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
32
year
old
babysitter
in
this
case
was
a
participant
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
oh,
a
32
year
old
babysitter,
well,
it
would
depend
if
you
knew
it
was
babysitter,
you
knew
she
had
nothing
to
do
or
no
knowledge
of
the
conspiracy,
then
probably
you
ought
to
turn
it
off,
or
there
maybe
circumstances
in
which
you
can
listen
to
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
minimization
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
minimization
requirement.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
some
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
mr.
justice
brennen
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
expressed
concern
that
if
our
position
concerning
that
the
proper
standards
should
be
objective
reasonableness
were
adopted.
there
would
be
a
danger
that
interceptions
would
then
be
validated
by
what
they
turn
up.
we
submit
that
there
is
--
that
that
concern
is
certainly
understandable,
but
that
it
does
not
accurately
reflect
our
position
or
the
analysis
the
court
of
appeals
engaged
in
this
case.
it
does
not
reflect
our
position
because
as
i
was
stating
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
our
position
is
simply
that
the
reasonableness
of
interceptions
has
to
be
based
on
what
is
going
on
at
that
time
and
that
if
it
is
unreasonable
for
an
agent
to
listen
to
conversations
in
view
of
what
he
is
–
although
the
inputs,
sensory
inputs
on
him,
then
if
by
chance,
it
turns
up
evidence
is
our
position
that
that
evidence
should
be
suppressed
and
that
essentially
is
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
engaged
in
this
case.
essentially,
it
is
no
different
than
any
analysis
where
the
courts
try
to
decide
for
example,
whether
a
policeman
was
justified
in
arresting
someone
or
stopping
and
frisking
someone
on
the
basis
of
circumstances
at
that
time.
even
though,
that
person

apart
from
our
legal
position
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
essentially
your
honor
we
were
relying
on
our
brief
as
to
standing
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
about
it.
apart
from
our
legal
position,
our
factual
response
to
the
petitioner's
claim
about
lack
of
good-faith
efforts
is
that
the
record
simply
does
not
support
the
claim
of
the
agents
here
acted
in
bad-faith
or
intended
to
ignore
their
minimization
obligations.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
testimony
of
agent
cooper
to
the
effect
that
he
was
aware
of
the
minimization
requirements
that
he
instructed
his
agents
with
respect
to
them,
that
he
never
instructed
his
agents
to
listen
to
every
call,
and
if
they
had
heard
the
cause
it
appeared
to
be
unlikely
to
relate
to
the
investigation,
they
would
have
turned
them
him
off
and
i
would
not
burden
the
court
with
recitations
to
this
transcript.
but
i
would
only
point
out
that
the
petitioner's
claim
to
the
contrary
and
the
district
court's
finding
to
the
contrary
is
based
on
logical
fallacy
that
it
is
based
on
testimony
that
does
not
logically
support
the
conclusion.
for
example,
again
to
take
the
simple
example
of
the
case
where
over
the
period
of
intercept,
only
one
conversation
is
intercepted
and
it
happens
to
be
reasonable
to
intercept
it
because
it
is
clearly
crime
related.
suppose
the
agent
in
that
case
at
a
suppression
hearing
had
been
asked
repeatedly
as
agent
cooper
was
asked
in
this
case.
well,
did
you
ever
make
any
efforts
to
minimize
the
interception
of
conversations?
did
you
ever
consider
your
minimization
obligations?
can
you
point
to
any
instance
in
which
you
exercised
discretion
that
resulted
in
the
non
recordation
as
discretionary
matter
as
to
what
was
overheard.
if
the
agent
in
my
example
had
given
negative
answers
to
that
question,
that
would
not
reflect
that
was
operating
in
bad
faith,
it
would
only
reflect
that
he
intercepted
the
only
call
that
came
over
the
line.
and
that
is
essentially
the
basis
for
the
petitioner's
claim
on
bad
faith
and
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
analysis.
if
the
court
accepts
our
position
that
the
proper
standard
is
objective
reasonableness,
the
question
remains
whether
the
interceptions
in
this
case
were
objectively
reasonable
and
in
their
briefs
the
petitioners
do
not
seriously
challenge
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
it
was
objectively
reasonable
to
intercept
all
of
the
calls
in
this
case.
and
they
do
not
point
at
least
in
their
briefs
to
any
calls
that
should
not
have
been
intercepted
or
any
reasons
as
to
why
they
should
not
have
been
intercepted.
but
the
court
may
be
interested
in
the
question
more
generally
of
general
considerations
that
apply
to
determining
whether
interceptions
are
reasonable
or
not
reasonable
and
at
the
outset
i
want
to
stress
again
that
it
is
not
our
intent
to
validly
importance
of
the
statutory
minimization
requirements.
we
recognize
that
they
are
designed
to
serve
and
accommodate
important
individual
interest
in
privacy.
but
how
those
interests
can
best
be
implemented
in
each
particular
case
often
poses
some
very
difficult
problems.
now
the
court
of
appeals
started
with
a
proposition
that
seems
clearly
correct
to
us,
that
the
very
nature
of
interceptions
that
are
authorized
and
limited
by
the
statute
requires
monitoring
agents
to
listen
to
at
least
some
portion
of
every
call
before
they
can
make
any
judgment
as
to
the
likelihood
that
the
call
is
going
to
be
relevant
or
irrelevant.
now
how
much
of
the
call
may
then
be
reasonably
intercepted
depends
on
a
wide
variety
of
circumstances
including
what
the
agents
know
about
the
callers,
the
scope
of
the
criminal
enterprise,
the
degree
of
coded
language
employed
in
the
call
and
so
forth.
and
many
of
those
considerations
can
be
applied
only
after
the
agents
have
been
able
to
develop
some
patterns
among
the
calls.
the
court
of
appeals
have
developed
a
number
of
relevant
factors
including
those
i
have
just
mentioned
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
enumerate
an
exhaustive
list.
in
some
kinds
of
cases,
it
may
be
possible
for
agents
to
develop
more
or
less
formal
procedures
or
guidelines
with
respect
to
how
they
are
going
to
go
about
and
intercept.
for
example,
in
a
gambling
case,
if
they
have
reasonably
if
the
john
smith
is
conducting
his
gambling
business
from
a
certain
telephone,
from
his
residential
phone
but
has
three
small
children
or
three
teenaged
children,
it
may
be
possible
for
the
agents
to
develop
guidelines
and
say
do
not
listen
to
the
calls
of
the
children
but
listen
to
the
calls
of
john
smith
because
in
a
gambling
case,
most
of
those
kinds
of
calls
are
simply
calls
where
the
caller
calls
in
and
places
a
bet,
right
off
the
bat,
they
go
right
in
the
business.
in
other
kinds
of
cases
like
narcotics
and
especially
particular
like
narcotics
conspiracies
where
there
many
unknown
participants
and
where
one
caller
a
always
a
known
participant.
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
the
agents
to
establish
guidelines
and
they
may
have
to
rely
on
an
ad
hoc
judgments
about
the
nature
of
the
calls
they
are
listening
to.
and
this
case,
i
think
reflects
that
narcotics
conspiracies
present
some
unique
difficulties
to
agents
conducting
interceptions
under
the
statute.
in
narcotics
conspiracies
at
least
like
this
case
it
is
very
typical
that
the
beginning
portion
of
the
conversation
is
largely
ambiguous
or
irrelevant
and
then
the
participants
may
refer
to
a
pseudo
cause
which
means
a
delivery
of
narcotics.
so
it
is
much
more
difficult
in
this
kind
of
case
for
agents
to
decide
with
any
great
degree
of
certainty,
what
kind
of
conversation
they
are
listening
to
or
to
apply
any
formal
procedures
with
respect
to
when
to
turn
them
off.
with
respect
to
the
additional
issues
in
this
case
concerning
the
scope
of
the
suppression
remedy
and
the
standing
of
petitioner
scott
we
rely
primarily
on
the
arguments
we've
addressed
in
the
brief.
i
would
only
emphasize
our
response
to
the
petitioner's
argument
that
if
as
we
contend,
the
statute
only
requires
a
suppression
of
conversations
that
should
not
have
been
intercepted
because
they
are
irrelevant.
then
agents
will
not
be
deterred
--
they
will
not
be
deterred
from
listening
to
every
conversation.
that
argument
seems
to
us
to
misconceive
the
traditional
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
not
to
punish
police
but
rather
to
remove
their
incentives
to
commit
unlawful
acts.
our
position
is
fully
consistent
with
that
traditional
purpose.
any
interception
that
should
not
have
been
intercepted
should
be
suppressed
thereby
removing
the
agent's
incentive
to
intercept
communications
and
violation
of
minimization
requirements.
but
beyond
that
there
is
even
less
reason
in
this
context
or
a
need
in
this
context
to
expand
the
suppression
remedy
because
this
statute
unlike
the
fourth
amendment
context
imposes
significant,
affirmative
sanctions
on
officers
who
violate
their
statutory
obligations
in
bad
faith,
civil
and
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
arguably
your
honor
although
the
statute,
specifically
exempts
i
believe
privileged
conversation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
a
possible
way
to
read
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
we
would
not
rely
on
that
reading.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
read
as
a
whole
is
to
authorize
only
certain
kinds
of
interceptions
of
certain
kinds
of
conversations
and
that
was
probably
what
the
minimization
provision
we
are
referring
to.
that
is
if
you
receive
an
authorization
to
intercept
to
obtain
narcotics
conversations,
it
seems
to
us
the
statute
probably
meant
that
you
were
not
supposed
to
receive
to
intercept
or
you
are
supposed
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
minimize
the
interception
of
non
relevant
conversations.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
we
would
contend
your
honor
that
the
authorization
under
a
court
order
extends
to
the
interception
of
communications
for
the
purpose
of
developing
evidence
relevant
to
the
investigation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
should
think
so
your
honor
although
i
want
to
think
about
that
a
little
longer.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
certain
circumstances
that
might
be
reasonable
although
i
would
not
want
to
take
it
too
far
because
if
you
took
that
too
far
you
could
intercept
everything.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
is
right.
but
we
would
not
contend
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
let
us
intercept
everything
for
any
reason,
only
for
reasonable
reasons.
