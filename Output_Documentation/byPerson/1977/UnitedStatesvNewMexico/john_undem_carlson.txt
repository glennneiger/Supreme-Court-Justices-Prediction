mr.
john
undem
carlson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
carlson
of
denver,
colorado.
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
twin
lakes
reservoir
and
canal
company,
a
colorado
mutual
ditch
company.
we
are
an
amicus
in
this
case
and
the
state
of
new
mexico
has
graciously
allowed
us
to
argue,
because
we
represent
the
classic
beneficiary
for
whom
the
national
forest
was
created.
we
have
a
large
for
colorado,
small
for
the
national
forest
perhaps,
diversion
project
located
on
the
very
headwaters
of
the
national
forest
rivers
in
colorado.
it
is
on
the
headwaters
of
the
colorado
river,
the
roaring
fork
to
be
particular,
some
17
miles
above
aspen,
colorado,
a
watering
spot
some
of
you
may
know.
that
diversion
project
intersects
and
gathers
water
from
scores
of
small
streams.
we
do
not
have
anything
like
the
patomic
river
out
there.
we
have
streams,
some
of
them
when
they
are
in
full
state
of
flood,
are
much
like
suburban
lawn
sprinkler.
we
intercept
all
of
these
as
they
go
across
our
canal,
and
deliver
the
water
into
a
tunnel
that
carries
forest
water
from
the
whiter
river
national
forest,
over
in
to
the
arkansas
river
valley.
that
system
was
constructed
first
in
1930,
and
it
continuously
has
diverted
water
with
the
aid
and
encouragement
of
the
forest
service
until
very
recent
times.
we
think
we
are
a
representative
of
the
class
for
which
the
national
forest
were
created,
because
congress
said
when
they
passed
the
organic
act
in
1897,
that
the
purpose
of
the
forest
was
to
secure
favorable
conditions
of
flows.
now,
when
they
said
favorable
conditions
of
flows,
they
were
not
saying,
“flows
for
flows
sake,”
they
said
“we
want
to
provide
water
for
the
people
of
the
district.
we
want
to
cause
there
to
be
an
availability
of
water,
so
that
the
people
who
are
settling
in
the
west,
can
construct
a
civilization,
we
have
done
so.
the
forest
service
apparently
does
not
like
it
today,
but
it
exists
and
it
is
there,
and
we
are
trying
to
protect
it.
the
importance
of
this
case
cannot
be
underestimated,
when
you
recognize
that
in
the
state
of
colorado,
98%
of
the
water
that
arises
in
the
whole
state
and
flows
through
the
streams
of
that
state,
arise
on
the
public
lands.
of
that
98%
of
the
water
flowing
on
the
public
lands
and
through
our
streams,
95%
of
it
comes
from
the
national
forests,
so
there
is
not
any
water
in
colorado,
except
what
occurs
on
the
national
forest.
that
statistic
is
contained
in
a
congressional
document
called
the
study
and
development
management
and
use
of
water
resources
on
public
lands.
it
was
prepared
for
the
public
land
law
review
commission.
it
is
contained
in
table
5
of
the
weekly
report.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
that
is
absolutely
right
your
honor.
new
mexico’s
particular
statistic
is
62%,
arizona’s,
nevada’s,
and
utah’s
are
up
in
the
90%
as
i
recall,
but
that
illustrates
the
importance
of
the
case
because
we
do
not
have
any
water
in
our
streams
except
what
originates
out
of
these
snow
pack
that
falls
in
the
high
mountain
country.
and
when
congress
passed
this
act
back
in
the
1890’s,
they
were
not
dummies.
they
knew
that
the
west
depended
on
snow
packs
in
the
high
mountain
country.
if
you
retarded
the
rate
of
runoff
in
that
high
mountain
country
you
would
cause
a
greater
sustained
rate
of
delivery
of
the
water.
now,
they
thought
that
it
was
important
to
deliver
water
to
people
for
economic
utilization.
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
the
statute
or
in
a
legislative
history
or
in
60
years
of
administrative
construction
that
anyone
thought
that
organic
act
of
1897
created
a
reserved
water
right
for
the
purposes
now
claimed
by
the
united
states.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
you
mean
what
purpose?
mr.
john
undem
carlson
your
honor,
i
will
answer
that
question
now
if
i
may?
we
think
that
to
the
extent,
the
forest
administrators
have
a
bona
fide
need
for
water
for
something
that
falls
within
the
2
fundamental
overwhelming
purposes.
they
can
have
rights
to
divert
water
for
those
purposes.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
well,
when
they…
mr.
john
undem
carlson
you
measure
them
by
what
the
quantification
is
to
attain
the
purpose.
for
example,
if
they
locate
a
district
headquarters,
and
employ
5000
people
in
it,
in
order
to
run
and
administer
the
forest,
and
they
located
it
on
forest
land,
we
would
concede
and
grant
them
a
water
right
to
do
that.
that
is
their
administrative
need.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
none
under
the
act
of
1897.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
that
is
true
and
the
reason
being
that
you
must
identify
the
purpose
for
which
the
forest
was
created.
it
was
not
created
for
wild
life
maintenance.
it
was
not
created
for
habitat
ecosystem
maintenance.
it
was
created
to
grow
trees.
now,
in
this
mr.
john
undem
carlson
absolutely.
if
they
could
prove
that
they
have
a
bona
fide
in
need
for
water
to
protect
from
fire,
they
could
get
a
right
to
divert
water
for
that
purpose.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
undem
carlson
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
force
marjorie
too.
if
there
is
a
fire,
people
will
take
the
water
and
put
out
the
fire
and
no
one
in
west
has
ever
objected
to
that.
what
they
are
claiming
is
a
right
to
here
now,
and
they
did
not
offer
any
proof
at
the
trial,
but
this
is
an
afterthought
by
the
united
states
on
appeal,
what
they
are
seeking
now
is
the
right
to
maintain
water
in
the
streams
in
case
there
is
a
fire
some
day.
well,
if
there
is
a
fire,
they
will
tell
everyone,
“we
need
water
to
come
down,”
but
you
know
the
curious
thing
and
the
amazing
thing
is,
i
do
not
know
of
a
national
forest
fire
in
the
country
that
has
ever
been
fought
with
diversions
out
of
babbling
brooks
as
a
high
mountain
country.
up
where
our
project
is,
for
example,
there
are
not
even
no
trees
to
speak
of,
we
are
about
10,000
feet
in
altitude,
but
we
would
allow
them
an
opportunity
if
they
think
that
fire
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
think
you
are
wrong
your
honor.
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
obtain
water
for
any
purpose
it
needs.
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
intended
to
obtain
in
1897.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
they
are
to
grow
trees,
to
furnish
a
continuous
supply
of
timber.
second,
to
secure
favorable
conditions
of
flows,
because
when
they
created
the
forest,
they
had
in
mind
using
that
watershed
to
maximize
delivery
of
water
to
the
private
appropriators
of
the
west
and
the
congressional
history
states
that
time
and
time
again.
they
said,
“you
know,
if
we
cut
off
the
trees
in
the
high
mountain
country,
then
the
snows
will
melt
sooner.
they
will
come
in
a
flood.
the
spring
will
run
off
and
will
come
in
as
flood.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
no,
that
goes
too
far.
there
are
administrative
needs.
if
they
could
prove
that
erosion
could
be
reduced
by
diversions
of
water,
it
could
be
reduced
by
forest
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
yes.
although
the
united
states
has
never
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
they
have
tree
seedling
farms
throughout
the
national
forest
and
no
one
in
colorado
has
contested
any
of
the
diversions
that
they
make
for
those
purposes.
they
plant
these
little
seedlings
on
the
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
absolutely
and
you
know,
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
that
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
absolutely.
they
are
de
minimis.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
but
in
the
west,
we
do
not
have,
in
this
high
mountain
forest,
we
do
not
have
a
big
phreatophyte
population,
what
we
have
is
ponderosa
pines
and
those
tress,
i
think
even
the
forest
service
would
obtain
a
very
significant
portion
of
their
moisture
from
the
air
and
that
is
well-known
fact.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
if
that
was
to
attain
the
end
of
furnishing
a
continuous
supply
of
timber,
yes,
but
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
prove
that
and
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
in
this
case,
they
offered
no
proof.
they
had
the
burden
of
going
forward.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
come
forward
and
state
what
their
case
was,
and
they
never
even
thought
they
have
a
minimum
stream
flow
right
at
that
trial.
the
only
time
they
raised
it
is
on
appeal
when
they
asked
this
court
to
receive
evidence
and
consider
this
matter
on
the
basis
of
their
arguments.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
this.
we
are
talking
about
facts
that
were
never
offered
or
submitted
to
the
trial
of
fact.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
your
honor,
who
was
camping
there?
if
it
is
a
forest
service…
mr.
john
undem
carlson
if
the
reason
they
want
to
put
out
the
campfires
is
because
they
have
allowed
the
public
to
come
on
for
a
recreational
purpose
and
if
they
need
a
water
right
for
that
recreational
use,
they
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
your
honors,
if
there
is
a
water
requirement
to
put
out
a
fire,
they
will
take
it.
it
is
a
de
minimis
use
which
everyone
will
recognize.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
you
honor,
our
streams
in
the
west
dry
up
by
nature.
in
colorado
for
example,
on
the
roaring
fork
system
that
we
took,
the
roaring
fork
river
was
dry
in
whole
reach
last
summer
for
three
months.
nature
dries
them
up.
there
is
an
incredible
variation
stream
by
stream.
what
we
are
talking
about
there
too,
what
you
are
suggesting
is
really
a
right
to
divert
water.
they
want
a
maintenance,
and
what
you
are
saying
is,
maintain
the
flow
of
the
stream
so
we
can
divert
some
water.
if
they
have
a
priority
for
that
purpose,
let
them
divert
it.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
am
asserting
that
and
i
submit
to
you,
it
is
very
much
what
congress
had
in
mind.
when
congress
wanted
to
stop
a
stream
from
being
dried
up,
it
knew
how
to
do
it,
it
passed
wild
and
scenic
legislation.
there
is
passed
legislation
to
maintain
stream
flows.
there
is
a
whole
congressional
pattern
of
action
that
maintains
streams
in
their
natural
state.
the
most
classic
example
i
put
to
you
is
the
national
parks
itself
where
they
talked
about
maintaining
this
aesthetic
sensibility.
what
the
court
i
think
must
consider
is
that
the
forest
was
created
for
purposes
of
economic
utilization.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
am
saying
that
whatever
right
the
united
states
has
by
virtue
of
its
reserved
right,
and
that
right
must
be
quantified,
then
they
can
cause
there
to
be
remaining
in
the
stream,
that
quantity
of
water
so
they
can
take
it
and
use
it
and
if
that
is
an
“inflow”
right
for
some
purpose,
which
they
have
not
yet
proved,
that
quantity
will
remain
in
the
stream.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
just
in
the
abstract
until
the
passage
of
the
multiple
use
act
of
1960,
we
contend
they
had
no
right
for
the
purposes
of
wildlife
maintenance
or
simply
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
you
honor,
i
do
not
think
either
of
our
two
basic
purposes
assume
the
need
for
water
in
the
river.
one,
the
purpose
of
sustaining
forest
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
okay,
securing
favorable
conditions
of
flow.
i
am
not
directly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
because
the
flow
is
for
the
use
of
the
people
of
the
district.
there
are,
in
colorado
some
4000
headgates
located
on
the
national
forest.
it
is
an
(inaudible)
of
an
arrogant
desert
climate
that
you
take
the
water
out
of
the
stream
and
consume
it.
the
fact
that
it
happens
on
the
national
forest
as
opposed
to
one
mile
down
from
the
national
forest
should
not
make
not
difference.
our
rivers
typically
dry
up.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
it
was
not
designed
to
create
a
right
in
the
federal
government,
it
was
a
grant
to
the
people
of
the
west
and
the
perfect
confirmation
of
that,
your
honor,
is
the
statute,
the
part
of
the
organic
act
in
which
it
says,
“all
waters,”
not
some
waters,
not
10%
of
the
waters,
not
90%
of
the
waters,
it
says
“all
waters”
arising
on
the
national
forest
may
be
appropriated
for
domestic,
milling,
mining,
and
irrigation
use.
now,
i
guess
where
i
am
from,
when
they
say
all,
they
mean
all
and
here
what
the
united
states
says
is
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
that
is
right.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
but
your
honor,
nowhere
in
the
forest
act
do
they
say
they
wanted
to
reserve
anything.
what
you
have
is
an
expressed
grant
before
that
--
mr.
john
undem
carlson
that
is
right,
but
here,
in
the
forest
act,
you
have
an
expressed
grant.
all
waters
arising
on
the
national
forest
may
be
appropriated
whether
under
a
national
system
or
a
state
system.
we
have
never
had
a
national
system.
so,
you
have
an
expressed
grant.
later,
you
have
the
theory
of
the
implied
reservation
and
what
the
united
states
is
asking
you
to
do
is
to
stand
the
act
on
its
head
and
say
that
all
means
some
or
none.
now,
let
me
address
a
point
that
i
think
really
needs
fundamental
attention
from
this
court.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
fine,
let
them.
in
colorado,
they
have
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
that
was
not
an
act
of
appropriation.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
no,
your
honors.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
well,
here
they
never
addressed
the
question
of
how
the
forest
and
for
what
purposes
they
were
created.
in
arizona
v.
california,
the
special
master
said,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
sure.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
when
they
created
the
forest,
they
said,
“we
are
creating
the
forest
for
these
two
purposes
and
if
there
are
water
needs
peculiar
to
united
states,
inherent
in
those
needs,
then
they
can
have
the
water.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
united
states
calls
it
a
reservation.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
call
it
reservation.
this
court
has
called
it
a
reservation.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
yes,
it
is
a
water
right.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
it
certainly
is
if
they
are
claiming
that
they
have
(voice

mr.
john
undem
carlson
well,
let
them
come
in
and
share
at
the
date
that
they
conceive
the
notion
for
these
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
undem
carlson
yes.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
it
is
small.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
agree.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
i
do
agree.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
yes.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
well,
you
do
not
understand
what
i
am
saying
about
the
inconsistency
and
i
think
i
have
made
my
self
unclear
on
that
point.
what
i
have
said
and
what
we
say
and
what
new
mexico
said
was
that
congress
had
the
power
to
take
all
of
the
water
it
wanted
as
of
that
date
that
was
inappropriate,
it
did
not
do
so.
so
the
question
that
we
are
facing
here
is
exactly
what
we
faced
in
paper.
what
quantity
of
water
did
congress
intend
to
keep
to
itself
in
1897?
mr.
john
undem
carlson
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
riparian
doctrine.
it
is
a
strange
and
wonderful
meld
of
many
kinds
of
theories.
the
court
consistently
calls
it
a
reserved
right.
we
prefer
to
think
it
of
it
an
appropriation
terms
because
that
is
the
only
system
we
have
out
there.
there
are
unique
functions
of
appropriation.
i
suppose
if
the
united
states
says
it
is
immune
from
requirements
and
that
sort
of
thing,
so
they
do
not
like
the
lingo.
but
conceptually,
the
notion
is,
in
1897,
they
were
saving
something
for
themselves
and
we
are
trying
to
identify
what
it
is
that
they
say.
mr.
john
undem
carlson
thank
you.
