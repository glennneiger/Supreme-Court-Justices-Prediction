we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
new
mexico.
mr.
moorman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
this
court
do
with
judge
rifkin’s
finding
or
recommendation?
i
forgot
how
you
described
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
as
of
1897?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
simms.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
certainly
take
a
position
i
think
in
your
brief
do
you
not,
that
since
the
doctrine
of
reserved
rights
says
it
is
exemption
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
general
law
that
appropriation
of
water
in
the
western
states
is
governed
by
state
law,
since
it
is
an
exception,
the
implied
reservation
should
be
minimally
and
narrowly
understood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
take
that
basic
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
united
states
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
carlson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carlson,
you
did
not
answer
to
my
brother
why
a
moments
ago,
you
said,
“you
would
restrict
the
doctrine
of
reserved
rights
for
the
national
forest
to
the
two
fundamental
statutory
purposes,
and
what
are
they,
i
did
not
get
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
is
really
no
reserved
rights
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
as
proprietors,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
goes
to
growing
trees
to
preserving
the
vigor
of
the
forest,
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
is
that
it,
and
so
what
call
it,
an
appropriation,
a
reservation,
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carlson,
your
time
has
expired
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moorman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
