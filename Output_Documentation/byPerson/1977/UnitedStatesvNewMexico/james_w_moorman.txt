mr.
james
w.
moorman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
gila
national
forest
was
created
by
a
series
of
presidential
proclamations
issued
between
1899
and
1910
which
reserves
certain
public
lands
in
new
mexico
to
entry.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
doctrine
of
reserved
water
rights,
those
reservation
proclamations
also
reserved
waters
of
the
real
members
for
the
needs
of
the
gila
national
forest
for
“instream
flow”
for
fish
and
wildlife,
for
stock
watering
and
for
recreation.
the
case
began
before
a
special
master
appointed
by
the
state
district
court
in
new
mexico
who
concluded
that
the
united
states
did
indeed
have
such
water
rights
for
those
purposes.
the
state
district
court
disagreed
with
the
special
master
upon
objection
the
objection
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
held,
first,
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
a
reserved
water
right
for
recreation
purposes
for
use
in
the
forest.
secondly,
the
state
district
court
held
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
reserved
water
rights
for
stock
watering
purposes
within
the
national
forest
and
thereby
leaving
grazing
permitees
to
obtain
whatever
rights
they
could
under
state
law.
thirdly,
the
state
district
court
held
that
the
united
states
could
not
have
a
reserved
water
right
for
an
“instream
flow”
in
real
members
for
those
or
any
other
purposes
and
fourthly,
the
district
court
without
comment
deleted
from
the
master’s
proposed
decree,
a
water
right
for
wildlife.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
there
are
no
upstream
appropriators,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
there
are
some
in
holdings
upstream
which
might
at
some
point
become
a
point
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
the
forest
of
course
goes
up
to
the
crest.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
we
have
wondered
in
this
case
why
it
was
challenged
by
new
mexico,
but
we
do
believe
that
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
because
we
are
required
we
believe
to
claim
all
of
the
water
rights
which
we
claim
for
the
national
forest
in
this
proceeding.
so
if
we
do
not
claim
the
water
right
now,
we
would
be
forever
foreclosed
from
claiming
it
later.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
a
later
appropriator
upstream
in
an
in
holding.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
but
of
course
we
are
interested
in
an
“instream
flow”
below
the
crest.
there
are
in
holdings
in
the
forest
above
the
points
in
the
real
members..
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
they
are
not
users,
but
there
are
private
lands
upstream
which
could
be
points
of
diversion.
in
addition
to
that,
someone--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
but
of
course
if
we
did
not
have
a
water
right,
we
would
have
not
basis
for
denying
them
the
right
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
believe
that
the
"instream
flow”
your
honor,
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
all
the
downstream
appropriators,
junior
or
senior
because
it
is
a
non-consumptive
use
of
water.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
doubt
that
your
honor
because
i
am
sure
they
want
"instream
flows”
to
reach
them.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
the
people
who
would
complain
about
"instream
flows”
generally
would
be
upstream
junior
appropriators.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
it
does
not.
it
flows
down
into
the
desert
and
somewhere
north
of
the
mexican
border.
it
is
not
really
tributary
to
any
other
stream.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
the
gila
does,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
so
i
understand.
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
affirmed
the
district
court,
holding
specifically
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
any
rights
to
maintain
an
"instream
flow”
in
the
real
members
and
in
addition
specifying
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
reserve
rights
for
the
purpose
of
stock
watering
and
recreation.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
reached
this
holding
because
it
concluded
that
the
purposes
for
which
the
united
states
claimed
reserved
rights
from
the
real
members
for
the
gila
national
forest
were
not
within
the
purposes
for
which
a
forest
could
be
established
under
the
organic
administration
act
of
1897.
under
that
act
in
new
mexico’s
court’s
view,
a
national
forest
can
only
be
established
for
the
two
purposes
of
supplying
timber
or
supplying
water
for
downstream
appropriators.
the
new
mexico
court
reasoned
that
the
reservation
of
land
for
the
gila
national
forest
could
not
have
reserved
water
rights
for
stock
watering
or
recreation
as
those
were
not
the
purposes
of
the
reservation.
the
new
mexico
court
also
held
that
the
united
states
could
not
reserve
an
"instream
flow”
for
any
purpose.
the
specific
present
rights
which
the
united
states
seeks
in
the
members
are
set
forth
at
pages
192
and
193
of
the
appendix.
there,
as
set
forth,
91.18
acre
fee
of
consumptive
use,
mostly
for
stock
watering.
there
are
also
listed
a
few
rights
there
on
page
192
and
193
for
domestic
recreation
which
is
another
word
for
campground.
there
is
one
small
right
listed
for
tenth
of
an
acre
foot
for
wildlife.
in
addition,
there
are
some
rights
listed
for
matters
not
in
contention
here
for
stock
watering
and
residential
and
that
would
be
at
the
ranger’s
home
with
the
fire
tower.
also
listed
are
the
three
non-consumptive
inflow
stream
rights
of
2
cubic
feet
per
second
each.
the
special
master’s
report
also
provided
that
the
united
states
could
have
a
year
to
present
additional
claims
for
the
future
needs
of
the
forest
if
the
united
states
chose
to
do
so
because
the
district
court,
however,
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
united
states
could
not
have
most
of
the
rights
it
sought
here,
and
because
the
united
states
appealed
that
ruling,
the
time
never
arrived
for
the
united
states
to
submit
any
evidence
of
future
needs.
however,
if
we
prevail
here
today,
your
honors,
we
will
submit
evidence
of
some
additional
consumptive
use,
but
no
additional
"instream
flow”
use.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
measured
at
three
locations.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
no,
your
honor.
the
governing
law
of
this
case,
the
doctrine
of
reserved
water
rights
is
not
in
dispute.
it
rests
on
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court.
reserved
water
rights
are
often
referred
to
as
winters
rights
after
the
leading
decision
of
this
court
in
1908
in
the
united
states
vs.
winters
which
first
fully
enunciated
the
doctrine.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
i
believe
it
depends
i
guess
on
what
you
think
is
long,
but
we
have
at
least
80
years
of
decisions
now
and
there
are
six
or
seven
supreme
court
opinions
on
the
subject.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
doctrine
was
foreshadowed
in
the
1899
decision
of
united
states
vs.
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
company
which
discussed
a
number
of
the
authorities
cited
by
new
mexico
here.
in
that
case,
the
court
stated,
with
regard
to
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states,
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
authority
from
congress,
a
state
cannot
by
its
legislation
destroy
the
right
of
the
united
states
as
the
owner
of
lands
bordering
on
a
stream
to
the
continued
flow
of
its
waters
so
far
at
least
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
beneficial
uses
of
government
property
and
i
am
citing
174
us
at
703.
most
recently,
in
1976,
this
court
enunciated
the
doctrine
in
the
case
of
cappaert
vs.
the
united
states
as
follows.
when
the
federal
government
withdraws
its
land
from
the
public
domain
and
reserves
it
for
a
public
purpose,
the
government
by
implication
reserves
a
pertinent
water
then
unappropriated
to
the
extent
needed
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
reservation.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
in
that
case,
the
united
states
reserved
water
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
pupfish
for
somewhat
limited
purpose.
here,
the
question
is
what
are
the
purposes
of
the
gila
national
forest
and
whether
the
water
rights
which
the
united
states
claims
falls
within
those
purposes.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
reserve
water
rights
it
seeks
for
wildlife,
for
stock
grazing
and
for
recreation
and
for
"instream
flows”
for
those
and
other
purposes
such
as
fire
protection
or
to
provide
a
continuous
flow
of
water,
do
indeed
fall
within
the
purposes
for
which
the
gila
national
forest
was
reserved.
since
there
have
been
some
questions
on
it,
i
would
like
to
take
up
first
if
i
could
the
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
only
if
congress
authorizes
it
and
of
course,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
ramifications
of
that
would
be,
your
honor.
it
would
be
hugely
expensive
at
this
late
date.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
think
mr.
justice,
you
understand
the
politics
very
well.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
i
think
congress
has
never
taken
upon
itself
to
give
up
the
reserve
water
rights,
so
i
think
we
must
take
the
law
as
it
stands
in
that
way.
they
have
certainly
been
aware
of
them
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
new
mexico
courts
held
that
the
united
states
could
not
have
an
"instream
flow”
in
the
real
members
for
any
purpose
whatsoever.
we
consider
this
both
an
absurd
and
a
harsh
result
because
it
means
that
junior
appropriators
could
take
all
of
the
water
from
the
streams
and
dewater
the
national
forest
so
there
would
be
no
water
available
for
any
purpose,
legitimate
or
not.
now,
as
i
read
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
they
have
conceded
that
this
holding
goes
too
far
and
that
the
united
states
can
have
an
"instream
flow”
in
the
national
forest
for
the
appropriate
purposes
of
the
national
forest.
i
further
read
their
brief
to
their
position
to
be
that
they
simply
differ
with
us
as
to
what
are
the
appropriate
purposes
of
the
national
forest.
they
are
taking
a
much
narrower
view
than
the
united
states
does
and
we
believe
that
this
concession
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
alone
requires
reversal
in
this
case
and
i
refer
the
court
to
footnotes
11
and
15
of
the
state’s
brief.
the
state’s
concession
is
well
grounded
because
it
is
clear
that
the
cases
have
not
distinguished
between
flow
and
diversion
rights.
i
have
referred
and
quoted
earlier
the
first
case
touching
on
the
reserve
rights
doctrine,
the
1899
decision
in
the
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
company
case
where
the
water
rights
of
the
united
states
are
referred
to
as
the
continued
flow
of
its
waters.
special
master
rifkin
in
his
opinion
in
arizona
vs.
california
stated
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
national
forest
was
to
maintain
natural
flows
and
the
organic
act
itself
states
as
the
second
purpose
for
which
national
forests
may
be
established
for
the
purpose
of
securing
favorable
conditions
of
water
flows.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
this
court
issued
a
decree,
your
honor,
in
which
it
stated,
decreed
that
the
united
states
had
the
right
to
divert
water
from
the
gila
and
san
francisco
rivers
in
the
gila
national
forest
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
the
decree,
in
quantities
reasonably
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
gila
national
forest
with
priority
dates
of
the
date
of
withdrawal
for
the
forest
purposes
of
each
area
of
the
forest
within
which
the
water
is
used
and
that
is
376
us
at
350.
now,
that
tract
almost
exactly
the
language
of
the
proposed
decree
of
special
master
rifkin
which
he
attached
to
his
report.
in
his
report,
judge
rifkin
stated
more
specifically
what
the
purposes
of
the
forest
were.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
it
was
not
incorporated,
but
it
is
our
view
that
it
had
to
be
the
predicate
for
the
decree
or
the
decree
did
not
decree
any
rights.
it
only
then
stated
rule
of
law
if
that
was
not
the
predicate
for
the
decree.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
of
course
that
that
collaterally
stops
new
mexico
which
was
a
party
to
that
case
here.
with
respect
to
all
the
water
rights
we
claim,
your
honor,
whether
they
are
"instream
flow”
rights
or
consumptive
rights,
we
argue
that
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
such
rights
as
they
are
all
within
the
purposes
of
a
national
forest
under
the
organic
act.
the
organic
act,
your
honor
reads
in
relevant
part
as
follows,
if
i
may.
no
public
forest
reservation
shall
be
established
except
to
improve
and
protect
the
forest
within
the
reservation
or
for
the
purpose
of
securing
favorable
conditions
of
water
flows
and
to
furnish
a
continuous
supply
of
timber
for
the
use
and
necessities
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.”
in
the
following
paragraph
of
the
organic
act
in
relevant
part,
the
act,
the
congress
instructed,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
make
provisions
for
the
protection
against
destruction
by
fire
and
deportations
upon
the
public
forest
and
forest
reservations
and
a
little
bit
further,
he
was
instructed
that
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
and
establish
such
service
as
will
ensure
the
objects
of
such
reservations,
namely
to
regulate
their
occupancy
and
use
and
to
preserve
the
forest
thereon
from
destruction.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
they
are
getting
worse
as
i
read
them
coming
out
of
congress,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
well,
i
would
not
blame
this
court
for
that.
our
first
argument
under
the
organic
act,
your
honor
is
that
those
provisions
of
the
organic
act
which
call
for
the
protection
and
preservation
of
the
national
forest
must
by
implication
have
reserved
water
for
the
national
forest.
first
the
congress
stated
as
its
first
reason
for
the
establishment
of
national
forest
that
they
would
be
improved
and
protected
and
secondly
your
honor,
the
congress
twice
gave
clear
instructions
to
the
secretary
that
he
should
take
actions
to
protect
and
preserve
the
forest
at
one
point
referring
to
preservation
of
the
forest
as
one
of
the
objects
of
the
reservations.
thus
we
argue
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
the
secretary
needs
water
so
as
to
protect
the
forest
it
must
be
reserved
or
congress’
plan
would
be
thwarted.
for
example,
the
development
and
placement
of
stock
waterholes
is
often
the
only
way
or
the
best
way
to
insure
an
even
distribution
of
the
stock
over
the
forest.
a
failure
to
achieve
an
even
distribution
of
stock
can
quickly
lead
to
overgrazing,
growing
land
and
erosion.
thus
when
the
forest
ranger
locates
a
water
source
for
stock
he
is
not
thinking
simply
of
providing
water
for
use,
but
he
is
also
thinking
of
protecting
the
very
soil
the
forest
from
erosion.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
no,
the
first
proclamation
was
on
march
2,
1899,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
june
6,
1897.
now,
this
principle
of
preservation
applies
equally
to
something
such
as
a
camp
ground
although
you
might
not
think
so
at
first.
when
a
ranger
locates
his
camp
ground
with
a
water
diversion
he
thinks
not
only
of
servicing
campers,
but
he
also
thinks
of
minimizing
the
risk
of
fire
from
the
careless
camper.
by
locating
his
diversion
at
a
specific
place,
he
not
only
attracts
the
camper
to
a
safe
location,
he
provides
a
source
of
water
to
put
out
the
fire
and
clearly
if
protection
of
the
forest
and
its
resources
requires
an
“instream
flow”
as
opposed
to
a
diversion
there
is
nothing
special
about
that.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes
indeed,
we
believe
that
the
forest
are
open
for
campers,
that
the
use
of
water
is
one
of
the
tools
which
the
forest
ranger
must
use
to
protect
the
forest
from
campers
among
other
things.
he
uses
it
as
incentive
to
guide
their
camping
in
certain
spots
where
it
is
safe
from
fire
and
as
a
resource
to
help
put
out
campfires.
i
should
point
out
that
the
use
of
the
forest
by
campers
and
other
recreation
is
quite
large.
in
1976
alone,
there
were
822
million
recreation
days
of
uses
on
the
national
forest.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
do
not
know
what
the
figure
was
in
1897,
but
we
do
know
that
the
area
of
the
gila
national
forest,
i
cannot
speak
for
the
members,
was
visited,
there
was
the
gila
hot
springs
which
was
later
taken
out
of
the
forest
in
may
into
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
no
doubt
about
it,
but
i
would
like
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
the
fact
that
i
think
that
congress
reserves
the
national
forest
for
campers
your
honor?
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
i
am.
the
congress
clearly
did
not
wish
the
national
forest
to
be
treated
the
way
national
parks
were,
which
is
to
say
areas
where
the
resources
would
not
be
used
in
an
economic
way
such
as
cutting
timber,
range,
or
hunting
of
deer.
however,
it
is
very
clear
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
did
intend
for
the
forest
to
be
used,
there
were
a
lot
of
references
in
the
legislative
history,
to
the
effect
that
the
forest
would
be
places
of
use
and
not
places
of
none
use
and
camping
by
all
sorts
of
people
was
something
that
was
done
quite
regularly
in
those
days,
not
only
for
the
kind
of
camper
we
think
of
today,
but
campers
in
connection
with
grazing
and
other
uses.
recreation
use
of
the
forest
was
known
at
that
time
and
furthermore
i
should
say
that
the
forest
service
assumed
from
the
very
beginning
that
this
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
national
forest
and
congress
in
fact
in
1899,
two
days
before
the
first
proclamation
was
issued
for
this
forest,
passed
a
law
authorizing
the
chief
of
the
forest
service
to
lease
land
in
the
national
forest
adjacent
to
hot
springs
for
the
purposes
of
recreation.
i
wish
to
make
one
other
argument
under
the
organic
act
and
that
concerns
the
provision
of
the
act
which
refers
to
occupancy
and
use.
the
statute
directs
the
secretary
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
to
regulate
the
occupancy
in
use
of
the
forest
and
we
would
argue
that
to
the
extent
that
he
needs
water
for
that
purpose,
water
is
also
reserved
and
it
would
work
this
way.
for
example,
a
ranger
would
often
times
go
out
and
examine
the
range
and
determine
that
it
is
under
utilized.
now,
he
may
prevent
over
use
by
fencing,
but
often
times
the
only
way
he
can
prevent
under
utilization
of
the
range
is
by
providing
a
water
source.
in
our
view
the
extent
to
which
the
forest
service
needs
water
for
use
in
occupancy
to
preserve
and
protect
and
to
promote
all
of
the
uses
which
congress
contemplated,
water
is
reserved
under
the
reserve
rights
doctrine.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
carlson
started
his
argument
by
stating
that
the
national
forest
supply,
95%
of
the
water
in
his
state,
which
i
believe
is
true,
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
forest
service
intends
to
use
only
one-half
of
1%
of
that
water
from
a
consumptive
use
and
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
where
there
is
a
letter
from
mr.
mcguire.
so
that
virtually
all
of
that
water
will
be
available
and
is
available
for
the
economic
uses
of
the
west.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
there
are
two
problems,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
is
an
inordinate
fear.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
is
an
inordinate
fear
of
the
size
of
the
future
needs
of
the
national
forest,
which
i
think
are
laid
to
rest
by
the
letter
from
the
chief
of
the
forest
service,
which
we
have
attachéd
to
our
brief.
the
second
thing
is
sort
of
an
allocation
thing.
mr.
carlson’s
client
is
trans
base
inverter,
and
therefore,
he
wants
to
take
the
water
very
high
on
the
stream
and
out
of
the
river
basin
itself
into
another
basin,
so
it
is
sort
of
an
allocation
question
with
regard
to
him.
the
water
if
it
stays
in
the
forest
will
be
available
for
economic
use.
it
may
not
be
simply
be
available
to
his
client.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
yes,
but
if
we
maintain
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
above
the
forest,
that
is
correct.
but
the
water
will
be
eventually
available
as
it
leaves
the
forest
for
economic
use
and
development,
and
therefore,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
total
amount
of
water
available
for
the
development
of
the
west,
the
effect
will
be
de
minimis.
it
will
have
an
effect
on
where
certain
points
of
diversion
can
be
and
where
it
can
be
used,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
a
significant
effect
as
the
fact
that
the
actual
amount
available
will
be
virtually
all
the
water
from
the
national
forest,
all
but
half
of
1%.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
think
that
the
effect
of
the
forest
service
right
on
most
appropriated
use
in
the
west
is
de
minimis.
when
you
find
unusual
situations
like
the
twin
lakes
people,
if
you
want
to
take
water
across
a
divide,
it
can
have
a
serious
effect.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
that
is
quite
possible
that
they
do
disagree
with
me.
i
do
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
another
point
if
i
may
in
brief
time,
which
is
that
new
mexico
and
the
amicus
have
suggested
that
the
sole
reason
of
the
state
courts
denied
rights
to
“instream
flows”
was
because
we
failed
to
prove
any
need
for
those
rights,
and
we
believe
this
misreads
the
state
rulings.
the
state
courts
did
not
deny
the
us
minimum
“instream
flows”
because
of
any
failure
of
proof.
quite
to
the
contrary,
they
stated
this
flatly
and
unequivocally
as
could
be
done
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
any
minimum
“instream
flow”
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
state
district
court
wrote
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
reserved
rights
to
minimum
“instream
flows”
based
upon
the
purposes
for
which
the
gila
forest
lands
were
or
could
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
public
domain
and
the
supreme
court
affirms
stating
that
“instream
flows”
were
not
contemplated
by
the
organic
act
and
i
refer
the
court
to
appendix
231
and
page
241
and
as
a
last
word,
i
will
simply
say
that
we
requested
permission
to
present
additional
evidence
after
the
state
objected
to
the
in-stream
after
the
evidence
closed
and
we
were
denied
that
right.
mr.
james
w.
moorman
i
think
that
is
the
origin
of
the
theory,
your
honor,
that
we
have
a
right
to
future
needs,
but
what
is
happening,
i
think
we
will
lay
that
to
rest
because
the
chief’s
letter,
which
we
attach
encompasses
the
total
present
and
foreseeable
national
forest
water
needs.
so
the
0.5%
includes
all
present
and
future
needs
and
in
water
adjudications,
we
are
quantifying
not
only
our
present,
but
our
futures
needs
in
cases
like
this.
so,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
0.5%
is
the
future
needs
of
the
forest
as
can
be
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
no,
but
the
courts
that
adjudicate
these
rights
and
--
mr.
james
w.
moorman
adjudication
will
and
we
are
going
to
present
these
rights
for
our
future
needs
and
in
my
opinion,
in
a
decade,
the
adjudications
will
be
over
virtually
in
the
west,
in
a
decade-and-a-half,
thank
you.
