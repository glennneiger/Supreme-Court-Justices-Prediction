mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
fundamental
mistakes
in
the
united
states'
approach
to
the
reservation
of
waters
in
national
forests.
the
united
states
views
its
powers
over
western
waters
as
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
and
the
us
either
ignores
or
hides
from
the
fact
that
congress
explicitly
relinquished
control
of
the
flow
and
the
use
of
the
waters
in
our
national
forests
of
respective
states.
compounding
that
fundamental,
legal,
and
historical
misapprehension
of
matter,
the
united
states
also
ignores
the
fact
that
unlike
any
other
federal
reservation
of
lands
from
the
public
demand,
the
national
forest
were
designed
with
respect
to
water
to
maximize
water
yield
to
appropriators
under
state
law.
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
about
whether
or
not
there
were
any
private
users
up
stream.
in
the
forest
there
are
in
the
real
members,
drainage
of
the
forest,
there
are
17,000
acres
of
patented
free
land.
there
are
a
number
of
diversions
on
some
of
these
lands.
some
of
the
diversions
are
being
made
by
other
parties
to
this
adjudication
against
whom
at
this
point
in
the
litigation,
the
rights
of
the
united
states
have
not
vested.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is
a
live
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
believe
it
is
and
it
is
also
live
in
the
sense
that
if
the
court
were
to
recognize
a
minimum
“instream
flow,”
we
would
effectively
prevent
the
transfer
of
any
water
rights
under
state
law.
that
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
property
right
under
state
law
as
is
the
right
to
divert.
if
we
jump
over
to
the
gila
side
in
the
same
forest,
you
can
see
its
effect
on
phelps
dodge
corporation.
phelps
dodge
spent
$125
million
buying
up
water
rights
transferring
them
to
a
point
above
certain
forest
lands,
in
total
spent
about
$425
million,
creating
a
smelting
plant
and
subsequent
to
all
of
that
the
united
states
by
filing
a
paper
in
the
office
of
the
state
engineer
in
new
mexico
informs
phelps
dodge
they
would
now
like
to
claim
a
minimum
“instream
flow”
below
that
point
of
diversion.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
we
do
not
challenge
the
whole
theory
of
reserved
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
true
and
unlike
the
assertion
of
the
united
states
that
there
is
no
difference
between
us,
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
difference
as
to
the
way
in
which
we
apply
the
doctrine.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
for
that
reason
and
other
reasons
your
honor
that
we
discuss
in
the
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
do
not
know
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
we
think
it
does
fit
in.
we
are
not
denying
the
existence
of
the
reservation
doctrine.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
precisely
what
it
did
in
cappaert,
to
look
at
the
authorizing
legislation
under
which
lands
might
be
withdrawn
from
the
public
domain
and
then
apply
the
principle
of
the
reservation
doctrine.
in
this
situation
forests
were
created
in
large
part
to
protect
the
watersheds
in
order
to
maximize
water
yield
to
appropriators
under
state
law.
the
national
legislator,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
repeatedly
in
his
rules
and
regulations
right
out
the
door,
26
days
after
the
act
was
passed,
noted
that
control
of
the
flow
and
use
of
water
was
left
to
the
individual
states.
by
its
assertion
of
claims
to
minimum
“instream
flows”
it
seems
that
the
united
states
is
going
quite
beyond
what
was
intended
before.
at
the
same
time,
the
decision
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
does
not
preclude
the
assertion
of
a
claim
to
minimum
“instream
flows”
provided
that
claim
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
purposes
of
the
organic
administration
act.
no
such
evidence
was
put
on
in
this
case.
the
only
evidence
that
was
put
on
in
this
case
related
to
the
protection
of
fish
and
we
submit
that
it
is
patently
clear
that
the
legislation
and
its
history
do
not
permit
a
reading
that
would
say
that
fish
purposes
were
among
the
purposes
for
which
the
lands
of
the
forest
could
have
been
withdrawn.
your
honors,
the
united
states'
reply
brief,
while
in
my
view
says
virtually
nothing,
i
think
it
is
probably
the
most
telling
brief
in
this
case.
in
response
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
creative
act
of
1891,
that
piece
of
legislation
that
authorizes
the
president
to
withdraw
lands
for
national
forests,
in
response
to
some
40
pages
of
history
relating
to
the
organic
administration
act
of
1897,
the
act
which
limits
the
purposes
for
which
lands
could
be
withdrawn
under
the
1891
act,
in
response
to
the
legislative
history
of
all
of
the
applicable
rights
of
statutes
up
on
into
this
century,
in
response
to
the
history
of
relating
to
the
decisions
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
in
response
to
the
decisions
and
opinions
of
the
general
land
office
and
indeed
the
united
states
attorney
general
in
its
replay
brief,
the
united
states
offers
no
rebuttal,
it
offers
no
legal
history,
it
offers
no
law.
instead
what
the
united
states
tries
to
do
in
our
view
is
to
muddy
the
waters,
is
to
make
it
a
little
bit
more
difficult
to
see
this
case
clearly.
the
united
states
explains
that
we
have
somehow
ameliorated
the
effect
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court’s
decision
in
our
brief
that
we
have
made
a
concession.
that
is
not
true.
indeed
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
the
case,
the
united
states
went
before
one
of
our
state
district
courts
and
put
on
evidence
in
support
of
what
it
says
we
just
now
said
they
can
do
in
our
brief.
i
do
not
think
their
understanding
of
the
decision
was
any
different
than
ours.
the
decision
was
rendered
the
way
it
was
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
for
any
of
these
other
matters.
in
the
united
states
brief
it
also
refers
to
a
number
of
appropriation
statutes.
this
court
has
never
before
held
that
reserved
water
rights
arise
out
of
appropriations
of
money,
reserved
water
rights
arise
out
of
withdrawals
of
land
from
the
public
domain.
the
united
states
most
importantly,
also
argues
that
the
us
never
relinquished
its
rights,
that
somehow
there
is
a
broad
power
in
the
united
states
that
makes
these
claims
accessible
now
and
because
of
that
broad
power,
this
court
should
not
strictly
construe
the
statutes
authorizing
the
withdrawal
of
land
from
the
public
domain.
i
think
their
interpretation
of
the
law
is
most
definitely
wrong.
they
make
reference
to
the
rio
grande
case.
indeed
though
in
the
rio
grande
case
and
subsequently
in
another
case
called
gutierrez
v.
albuquerque
land
and
irrigation
company,
this
court
said
this.
of
course
as
held
in
the
rio
grande
case
even
a
state
as
respect
streams
within
its
boarders
in
the
absence
of
specific
authority
from
congress
cannot
by
its
legislation
destroy
the
right
of
the
united
states
as
the
owner
of
lands
bordering
on
a
stream
to
the
continued
flow
of
its
waters,
so
far
at
least
as
maybe
necessary
for
the
beneficial
uses
of
the
government
property.”
they
seem
to
say
that
we
really
do
not
need
the
reservation
doctrine.
that
just
by
virtue
dicta,
the
united
states
could
by
fiat
and
say,
“we
now
want
water
in
the
west.
we
are
going
to
use
water
for
this
purpose,
therefore,
it
is
ours.”
the
waters
and
the
rest
were
severed.
plenary
control
was
relinquished
to
the
states.
when
justice
sutherland
used
the
adjective
plenary,
he
used
it
advisedly.
it
means
complete.
when
the
waters
were
severed
they
were
severed.
in
the
united
states'
view
there
is
some
illogical,
incomplete
severance.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
logic.
it
is
also
clear
from
a
reading
of
rio
grande
that,
that
case
was
a
case
that
says
the
united
states
may
protect
its
right
to
navigability.
that
case
got
back
to
the
supreme
court
three
years
later
in
1903.
if
the
court
takes
a
look
at
that
opinion,
it
is
clear
also
that,
that
case
related
only
to
navigability
and
not
to
none
navigable
waters.
the
important
language
with
respect
to
none
navigable
waters
is
in
justice
sutherland’s
opinion
in
1935,
in
california
oregon
power
company
v.
beaver
portland
cement.
he
said,
“in
the
absence
of
federal
legislation
the
states
would
be
powerless
to
affect
the
riparian
rights
of
the
united
states,
but
the
authority
of
congress
to
vest
such
power
in
the
states
and
that
it
has
done
so
by
the
legislation
to
which
we
have
referred,
cannot
be
doubted.
there
is
no
question
that
the
severance
of
water
affects
the
rights
of
the
united
states.”
no
question
whatsoever.
you
cannot
use
rio
grande
as
broad
brush
to
somehow
broaden
the
reservation
doctrine.
it
does
not
work.
your
honor,
i
think
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
an
attempt
by
the
united
states
to
protect
commendable
environmental
values
through
a
scheme
of
legislation
that
was
designed
to
do
something
else.
we
have
laid
out
the
history
of
the
applicable
legislation.
if
that
history
is
understood,
there
is
no
way
in
my
opinion
that
your
honors
could
believe
and
reverse
the
decision
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court.
it
is
simply
impossible.
if
this
case
is
decided
on
the
basis
of
historical
reality,
instead
of
on
the
basis
of
the
regrets
of
certain
justice
department
lawyers,
now
we
are
confident
that
the
decision
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
will
be
upheld.
thank
you.
