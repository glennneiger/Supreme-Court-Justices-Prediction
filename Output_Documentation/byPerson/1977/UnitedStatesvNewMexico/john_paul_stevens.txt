mr.
carlson,
i
am
really
am
puzzled
by
your
argument.
perhaps
it
just
reveals
my
lack
of
understanding
in
water
law,
but
i
thought
you
conceded
that
there
was
some
kind
of
reserve
right
in
the
united
states
for
the
two
basic
purposes.
one,
they
maintain
some
kind
of
flow
of
the
water,
yet
you
also
seem
to
say
that
not
withstanding
that
reserved
right,
the
state
could
authorize
appropriation
of
100%
of
the
water
upstream
of
the
forest.
are
you
saying
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
only
a
quantity
to
be
measured
by
what
they
want
to
divert
from
the
stream
or
do
they
have
any
right
at
all
to
have
water
to
continue
to
flow
through
the
forest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
for
the
basic
purposes
of
maintaining
water
flow,
one
of
your
two
basic
purposes
it
seems
to
me
assumed
a
need
for
a
continuous
flow
of
water
down
the
river.
i
just
do
not
quite
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
forget
the
trees,
the
other
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
favorable
conditions
of
flow
be
no-flow
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
right
does
the
federal
government
get
out
of
this
purpose
to
preserve
favorable
conditions
of
flow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
where
i
am
from,
when
they
say
they
want
to
reserve
something,
they
mean
they
want
to
reserve
something
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
understood,
the
doctrine
was
an
implied
doctrine
and
you
do
not
have
to
expressly
reserve?
