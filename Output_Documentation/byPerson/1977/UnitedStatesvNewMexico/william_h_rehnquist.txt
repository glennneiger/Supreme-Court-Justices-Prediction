well,
but
some
of
them
probably
do
not
think
so?

your
"instream
flow‚Äù
claim
is
bounded
on
the
downward
side
of
the
river
by
the
boundary
of
the
national
forest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
any
of
them
be
below
the
lower
boundary
of
the
national
forest?
justice
william

rehnquist
the
subject
water
rights
reserve
by
implication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
very
controversial,
would
it
not?
there
has
always
been
controversy
as
to
what
would
be
done
with
western
land
reservations
and
the
western
state
centers
and
representatives
have
always
kept
the
heat
on
the
department
of
the
interior
and
other
executive
agencies
to
make
sure
that
there
was
proper
consideration
for
the
interest
of
private
proprietors
on
western
land.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
totally
diverse
from
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
also
a
considerable
debate
that
is
reflected
in
the
briefs
and
opinions
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
national
forest
were
going
to
be
and
how
restricted
or
how
wide
open
those
purposes
were
going
to
be,
was
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
not
adopted
by
this
court,
was
it?
in
its
decree,
it
was
not
incorporated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
any
of
the
land
reserved
in
the
gila
national
forest
reserve
before
the
passage
of
the
organic
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
organic
act
was
what,
1897?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
justifying
the
water
for
campers
under
the
terms
of
the
organic
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
it
in
1897,
the
day
organic
act
was
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
congress
really
reserved
the
gila
national
forest
as
opposed
to
the
various
national
parks
for
the
purpose
of
use
by
campers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
would
probably
be
true
of
most
of
the
other
area
of
the
states
of
the
western
to
greater
or
lesser
degrees
since
the
forest
themselves
occur
at
the
higher
levels?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
through
phreatophytes
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
respect
with
to
phreatophytes
within
a
national
forest,
would
you
concede
the
government
reserve
the
right
to
the
necessary
underground
flow
for
the
maintenance
of
the
phreatophytes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
it
was
inappropriate
of
right
that
was
reserved,
not
a
riparian
type
of
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
moorman,
does
not
any
part
of
the
objection
to
your
position
is
kind
of
a
springing
use
character
of
the
claim
that
the
government
makes
that
it
is
0.5%
now,
but
under
your
theory,
it
could
be
20%
by
1990?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
chief
this
bind
the
future
chief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
united
states
against
new
mexico,
the
second
of
the
two
opinions
which
i
am
announcing,
deals
with
the
proper
application
of
a
so
called
"implied-reservation-of-water
doctrine."
the
rio
mimbres
which
furnishes
needed
water
to
portions
of
south-west
in
mexico
rises
in
the
gila
national
forest
near
silver
city
in
that
state.
as
part
of
a
general
stream
adjudication,
the
new
mexico
state
district
court
held
that
the
united
states
had
no
reserved
right
to
the
use
of
any
water
in
the
gila
national
forest
for
recreation,
aesthetics,
wildlife
preservation
or
cattle
grazing,
although
it
did
have
for
other
purposes.
the
united
states
appealed
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
in
turn
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico.
although
congress
has
never
expressly
reserved
any
water
for
use
in
the
gila
national
forest,
the
court
has
previously
held
that
when
the
president
in
accordance
with
the
an
act
of
congress
reserved
lands
from
the
public
domain,
there
is
impliedly
reserved
any
unappropriated
and
pertinent
water,
that
is
necessary
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
the
reservation.
the
implied
reservation
doctrine
however
extends
only
to
the
amount
of
water
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purpose
of
the
reservation,
no
more.
examination
of
the
organic
administration
act
of
1897
which
setup
our
system
of
national
forests,
demonstrates
that
congress
did
not
intended
to
reserve
water
in
the
gila
national
forest
for
aesthetic,
recreational,
wildlife
preservation
or
stockwatering
purposes.
not
only
are
the
purposes
of
national
forests
limited
in
the
act
of
timber
preservation,
watershed
improvement,
but
in
emphasizing
the
importance
of
watershed
improvement,
congress
evidenced
it's
concern
that
as
much
water
as
possible
reach
private
state
appropriators.
we
conclude
that
in
passing
the
multiple-use,
sustained-yield
act
of
1960,
congress
did
not
intend
to
reserve
additional
water
for
use
on
forest
lands
previously
withdrawn.
mr.
justice
powell,
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
this
case.
