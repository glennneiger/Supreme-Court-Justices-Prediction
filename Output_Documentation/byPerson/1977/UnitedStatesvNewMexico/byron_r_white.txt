what
does
the
record
show
as
to
why
the
“instream
flow”
issue
was
even
in
the
case?
are
there
any
upstream
users
to
the
forest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
the
issue
as
a
practical
matter
ever
arise?
in
the
sense
that
somebody
might
want
to
--
justice
byron

white
or
somebody
might
want
to
develop
water
above
the
forest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
the
“inflow”
issue
ever
be
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
case
because
if
it
does
not
rain
or
does
not
snow,
there
is
no
going
to
be
much
of
a
flow
and
if
it
does,
there
is?
what
is
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
challenged,
the
only
reason
they
challenged
is
you
claimed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
claim
it
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
kind
of
a
tough
question
“instream,”
why
would
it
ever
arise
here,
who
could
ever
possibly
interfere
with
your
“instream
flow?”
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
you
are
really
worried
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
you
go
to
the
crest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
fee
title
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
thought
you
said
there
were
not
any
upstream
users,
they
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
transport
the
water
elsewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
you
would
never
let
them
do
it
across
your
property,
across
the
national
forest,
they
would
have
to
get
you
permission.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
failing
that,
you
can
always
resort
to
imminent
domain,
can
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
moorman,
where
did
we
get
all
these
fancy
names
for
the
acts
like
the
creative
act
and
the
organic
act
and
multiple
use
sustained
yield
act?
somebody
down
in
the
department
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
figuring
out
fancy
names?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
“instream
flow”
is
really
a
live
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case
it
is
a
practical
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
the
feeling
from
your
brief
and
some
of
the
things
that
you
have
already
said
that
in
a
way
you
challenge
the
whole
theory
of
the
reserve
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
it
is
just
the
extent
of
it
you
are
arguing
about
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
fit
in
the
reserve
rights
doctrine
in
the
sense
that
when
the
united
states
is
reserved
up,
as
created
in
national
forest
that
this
is
sort
of
an
appropriation
of
water
for
beneficial
uses,
is
that
the
way
it
fits
in
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
want
to
know
that
the
reserve
rights
doctrine,
does
it
fit
in
with
what
you
feel
as
the
way
the
united
states
wanted
to
handle
this
water
or
to
dispose
the
water
or
is
it
just
an
exception
to
the
general
rule?
