unknown
speaker
well
your
"instream"
claim
goes
against
downstream
appropriators
who
are
prior
in
time
to
the
national
forest
proclamation?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
goes
against
upstreamers?
unknown
speaker
straighten
me
out
on
my
geography,
does
the
members
flow
into
the
real
ground?
unknown
speaker
but
the
gila
flows
in
the
colorado?
unknown
speaker
that
is
from
the
other
side
of
the
divide
there?
unknown
speaker
was
it
a
long
line
of
decisions?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
equating
the
propagation
in
cappaert
with
the
gila
trial
here,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
equating
the
concern
of
pupfish
in
cappaert
with
gila
trout
here,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
so
you
blame
the
lawmakers,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
about
what?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
really
know
many
diversions
in
the
history,
that
they
ever
divert
water
out
of
streams
to
water
trees
in
the
forest.
unknown
speaker
but
the
forest
themselves
rely
on,
the
planted
trees
rely
on
the
moisture
that
falls
on
them?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
are
really
saying
is
that
there
is
no
really
any
water
right
out
of
the
stream
in
a
practical
sense
for
the
forest?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
water
that
put
out
the
campfires?
to
dry
up
a
stream
running
through
the
forest,
there
is
just
not
any
water
around.
unknown
speaker
no,
this
is
a
public,
but
the
reason
why
they
campfires
put
out
is
to
protect
the
forest?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
say
that.
i
did
not
say
they
want
the
water
right
to
let
them
drink
it
or
for
recreational
use,
i
just
thought
for
defensive
use.
if
they
want
water
to
put
out
campfires,
there
has
to
be
some
water
in
the
stream.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
take
it
if
it
is
not
in
the
stream?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
suggesting
that
you
could
dry
up
the
water
running
through
the
white
river
national
forest.
as
far
a
reserved
right
is
concerned,
it
would
not
be
violated
if
you
diverted
all
the
water
out
of
the
streams
running
through
the
white
river
national
forest?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
united
states
said,
“well,
we
open
all
these
waters
for
appropriation,
and
now
we
are
going
to
appropriate
some
of
it?”
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
fine.
well,
they
did.
they
created
some
national
forest.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
is
what
you
say,
but
the
court
has
interpreted
that
in
effect
as
an
appropriation?
unknown
speaker
this
court
has
not
interpreted
the
creation
of
a
national
forest
as
an
act
of
appropriation.
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
say?
they
said
it
is
a
reservation
of
a
water
right?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
concede
there
is
a
reservation
for
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
describe
it?
was
it
a
reservation
of
a
right
or
when
you
they
created?
what
happened
when
they
created
the
forest?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
call
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
water
right?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
the
waters
in
the
national
forest
are
open
to
appropriation.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it?
this
is
the
united
states
just
sharing
in
the
water
that
is
available?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
let
us
just
talk
about
that
date
for
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
you
said
at
the
time
the
forest
was
created,
there
was
a
water
right
of
some
kind?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
as
small
as
it
is,
it
is
not
inconsistent,
i
suggest
to
you
with
the
notion
of
a
grant
of
these
waters
for
appropriation
purposes?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
argument
with
here
is
the
scope
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
alright,
that
is
a
big
issue,
i
grant
you,
but
let
us
not
say
that
it
is
—
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
suppose
you
will
agree
that
there
is
not
enough
water
to
go
around
and
that
it
may
well
be
that
your
water
claims,
if
they
are
sustained
will
mean
that
there
is
less
water
available
for
water
rights
that
have
already
been
appropriated
or
that
have
been
appropriated?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
or
otherwise,
we
would
not
have
the
amicus
briefs
from
this
gentleman’s
clients
or
from
others
here
that
they
think
that
their
appropriated
rights
are
going
to
be
cut
into?
unknown
speaker
well,
first,
is
that
not
a
fact?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
consumptive
views
point
though
it
does
not
really
answer
that
your
“instream
flow”
matter
because
if
you
are
entitled
to
maintain
a
minimum
stream
flow,
that
is
a
whole
lot
different
matter
than
consumptive
use.
unknown
speaker
and
that
certainly
would
prevent
people
from
taking
out
too
much
water
above
the
forest?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
there
would
not
be
any
problem
here
if
there
was
enough
unappropriated
water
to
satisfy
your
needs
and
satisfy
other
appropriated
rights
too?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
reasonable
men
and
men
of
goodwill
could
differ
with
you,
and
they
must
be
differing
with
you
and
have
a
different
view
if
they
are
going
to
take
the
rather
strong
and
earnest
positions
that
they
take
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
adjudication
will
