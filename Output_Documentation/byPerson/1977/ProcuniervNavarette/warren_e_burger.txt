e.

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
76-446,
procunier
against
navarette.
mr.
svetcov
i
expect
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
ran
him
down
deliberately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
negligently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
did
it
deliberately,
you
do
not
need
to
call
on
the
first
amendment,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
often
happens
here.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
adams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
doubt
counsel
the
court
in
narrowing
the
question
as
it
did,
just
trying
to
pass
on
what
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
said
his
allegations,
your
client's
allegations
that
state
officers
negligently
deprived
him
of
those
right
state
a
1983
cause
of
action
and
that
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case
not
what
kinds
of
acts
or
negligences
were
not,
that
is
for
the
trial,
but
whether
negligence,
the
question
here
is
whether
negligence
is
ever
recovered
under
any
circumstances
by
1983
at
least
under
the
narrow
limited
question
on
this
review
was
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
conceding
all
that,
again,
i
thought
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
negligence
producing
that
consequence
is
covered
by
1983?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
liable
in
the
state
courts,
is
what
you
mean
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
liable
in
the
state
courts
or
liable
under
1983?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
about
four
minutes
mr.
svetcov.
chief
justice

e.
burger

from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-446
procunier
against
navarette
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
