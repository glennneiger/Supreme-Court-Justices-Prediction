justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
question
about
that
particular
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
really
matter
as
i
understand
your
general
submission,
it
is
an
allegation
of
negligence
is
insufficient
under
1983?
would
it
--
are
you
suggesting
there
are
different
standards
depending
on
what
the
constitutional
violation
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
it
were
denial
of
access
to
the
courts,
perhaps
negligence
would
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
basic
position
is
that
even
if
it
were
before
us
your
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
attorney
general
you
are
reading
the
brief
rather
than
the
pleading
as
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
the
language
is
(inaudible)
result
of
interference
with
or
confiscation
of
such
correspondence
by
reason
of
negligence
and
understanding
the
rules
and
so
on,
where
confiscation
and
interference
certainly
is
not
just
ordinary
mishandling,
is
it?
that
is
not
a
truck
going
of
the
bank
of
the
river
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
we
should
look
at
the
brief
rather
than
the
pleading
itself?
is
not
the
test,
still
the
test
under
any
unconceivable
facts
can
be
shown
under
the
pleading
that
would
not
tie
under
relief,
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
is
negligence
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
study
the
regulations
and
realized
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
mail
he
was
supposed
to
refuse
to
deliver.
the
particular
act
was
intentional,
but
the
negligence
is
not
failing
to
study
the
regulation.
then
there
is
a
second
allegation
by
negligence
of
the
supervisors
not
training
their
people
on
how
to
handle
the
mail.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
negligence
that
you
are
talking
about
with
a
truck
going
off
the
road,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
what
about
taking
somebody's
life,
in
the
course
of
your
official
duties,
on
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
a
prison
guard
who
beats
up
a
prisoner
is
it
not
violating
1983?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think,
there
is
a
difference
between
a
negligence
case
involving
a
truck
going
of
the
road
say
and
losing
the
mail
for
that
reason
and
a
negligence
allegation
such
as
one
may
read
this
complaint
as
making,
in
which
the
negligence
alleged
is
that
the
officers
did
exactly
what
they
thought
they
were
supposed
to
do
and
the
particular
acts
they
did
were
deliberate
in
that
sense,
but
there
was
negligence
either
in
their
failing
to
read
their
regulations
or
in
their
superiors
in
instructing
them.
is
this
case
the
same
in
your
view
as
a
case
involving,
just
sloppy
handling
of
a
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
is
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr
adams
i
wonder
if
justice
stewart's
focus
is
on
the
word
?to
make
no
law?
is
part
of
your
submission
that
in
the
negligent
application
of
regulations
you
are
talking
about
a
law,
a
legal
rule
as
applied
to
your
client.
it
does
not
really
make
much
difference
whether
the
law
is
drafted.
they
say
this
mail
should
be
destroyed
or
if
in
the
practice
repeatedly
they
destroy
certain
kinds
of
letters.
that
is
in
the
nature
of
the
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
expression
as
applied
to
your
client,
whereas
when
a
truck
goes
off
the
road,
it
is
not
even
arguably
of
law
abridging
any
body's
freedom
of
expression,
is
that
the
distinction
you
are
seeking
to
draw?
