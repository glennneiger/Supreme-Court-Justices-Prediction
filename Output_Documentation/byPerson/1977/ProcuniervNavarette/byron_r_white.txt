before
you
get
back,
you
say
you
--
we
approach
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
13
pieces
were
lost
negligently?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you
say
it
was
just
through
negligent
conduct
in
the
sense
that
--
such
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
suggesting
of
just
negligence
--
they
lost
them
in
a
truck
somewhere
or
in
a
fire
or
is
that
what
is
your?
we
approach
it
that
way
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
sort
of
a
--
it
would
just
be
an
unconscious
act
which
--
just
a
negligent
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
single
question
that
we
--
does
the
single
question
on
which
we
manage
certiorari,
there
was
a
limited
grant,
was
there
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
that
include
the
question
of
whether
there
indeed
is
a
constitutional
right
that
with
respect
to
the
mail
or
do
we
adjudicate
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
which
the
prison
guard
should
have
known?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
then
arguably
anyway,
the
case
involves
a
question
of
a
--
even
if
there
was
a
deliberate
loss
here,
a
deliberate
refusal
to
mail
that
the
--
whether
or
not
the
state
is
viable
or
because
no
adjudicated
right
in
the
mail
had
ever
had
the
--
would
have
been
known
by
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
at
issue
here,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
a
--
and
even
if
a
deliberate,
even
if
a
deliberate
loss
of
the
mail
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
it
maybe
that
the
state
might
not
be
liable
because
the
right
hadn't
been
sufficiently
adjudicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
we
agree
to
you
on
that
particular
point,
we
would
never,
we
would
not
need
to
get
any
farther
without?
how
much
1983
deals
with
just
mishandling,
negligent
mishandling?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
say
its
perfectly
clear
they
deliberately
--
a
state
officer
deliberately
murders
some
prisoner
he
has
just
arrested.
he
just
does
not
like
him.
is
that
a
deprivation
of
life
without
requiring
to
say
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
deliberately,
if
he
deliberately
took
his
life
to
keep
him
from
going
to
church,
that
would
be
a
1983
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
am
asking
about
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involves
a
suit
by
an
inmate
of
a
state
prison
against
various
prison
officials.
it
was
brought
under
42
u.s.c.
1983
and
the
complaint
alleged
various
violations
of
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights,
among
which
as
a
claim
that
the
prison
officials
negligently
interfered
with
his
mailing
privileges.
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
california
dismissed
this
particular
claim
on
summary
judgment,
holding
that
the
prison
officials
were
immune
from
liability
for
damages
under
the
applicable
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
indicating
that
summary
judgment
on
immunity
ground
was
improper.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
judgment
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
officials
were
immune
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
opinion
we
have
filed,
attempts
to
state
the
reasons
for
this
result,
but
not
well
enough
to
convince
everyone.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
