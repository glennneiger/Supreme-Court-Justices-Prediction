justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel
is
--
are
we
focusing
here
on
some
sort
of
a
gloss
that
is
added
to
the
burden
of
proof
of
a
plaintiff
because
action
is
bought
under
1983
or
should
we
focus
on
the
definition
of
the
constitutional
right
itself?
supposing
this
case
had
been
brought
on
the
superior
court
of
california,
where
you
do
not
have
to
rely
on
1983,
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
would
your
arguments
be
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
could
not
you
assert
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim
in
the
superior
court
of
whatever
county,
soledad
is
located?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
take
1983
to
enable
a
superior
court
to
entertain
a
constitutional
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
so
you
conceive
to
be
the
constitutional
right
that
the
respondents
assert
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
decide
in
this
case
that
the
point
reserved
in
justice
powell's
opinion
in
procunier
v.
martinez
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
respondent,
that
is
that
there
is
a
right
of
inmates
to
communicate
by
letter?
do
you
think
that
constitutional
right
would
be
violated
if
a
prison
truck
carrying
mail
down
to
the
local
post
office
negligently
went
off
the
road?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
that
does
not
turn
on
anything
to
do
with
1983?
that
turns
on
a
definition
of
the
constitutional
right,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
read
page
12
of
the
appendix
at
paragraph
two
of
the
third
cause
of
action,
it
says
defendant
negligently
and
inadvertently
misapplied
the
prisoner
mail
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you
could,
under
the
rules
of
pleading
show
that
they
refuse
to
mail
that
because
they
did
not
properly
understand
the
regulation
rather
than
the
idea
that
just
got
left
in
the
drawer
when
everybody
else's
mail
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
svetcov
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more
then
i
will
try
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
because
i
have
taken
more
of
your
time
than
i
should.
is
it
not
possible
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
be
wrong
and
yet
this
part
of
the
complaint
state
a
claim
for
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
we
would
not
get
to
the
point
of
the
question
of
whether
there
is
in
fact
the
underlying
substantive
constitutional
right
because
at
least
it
had
not
been
annunciated
prior
to
that
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
just
did
not
like
the
guy?
he
was
not
going
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
church,
he
just
wanted
to
kill
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
great
tribute
to
your
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
the
record
that
you
are
not
pre
mature
in
the
sense
that
the
ninth
circuit
help
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
under
some
circumstances
for
failure
to
allow
a
prisoner
send
mail
out
of
the
prison
and
that
1983
authorized
the
statement
of
a
claim
for
the
violation
of
that
right
negligently?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
contours
of
the
first
amendment
right
or
about
some
limitations
that
1983
puts
on
the
on
the
first
amendment
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
if
you
and
brought
an
action
in
the
superior
court
of
california
under
the
constitution,
assuming
you
could
do
that
where
you
were
not
limited
by
whatever
limitations
1983
may
impose,
that
there
be
no
question
that
you
could
recover
safer
negligent
failure
to
get
the
mail
out
of
the
prisoners
as
a
result
of
a
truck
accident?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
city
has
a
park
with
an
amplifier
system
that
it
makes
available
to
all
sorts
of
different
political
groups
and
you
represent
a
group
that
has
had
the
park
made
available
to
it
and
the
amplifier
system
breaks
down
due
to
failure
of
proper
maintenance
on
the
part
of
the
city,
is
that
a
violation
of
your
group's
first
amendment
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
a
mail
truck
running
off
the
road?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
your
part
of
your
problem
here
an
effort
to
plead
a
1983
complaint
out
of
a
personal
injury
form
book
really?
