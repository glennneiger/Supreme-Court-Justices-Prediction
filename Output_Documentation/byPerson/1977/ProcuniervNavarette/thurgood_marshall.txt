justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happened
if
the
truck
went
off
road
every
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
accidentally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
accidentally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
times
his
mail
negligently
not
delivered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
submits,
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
is
submitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
should
know,
destroy
this
man's
mail
negligently
or
non
negligently,
what
is
wrong
with
that
and
i
use
word
negligently
as
you
use
it
which
is
not
the
way
i
use
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
tell
me
what
do
you
mean
by
in
this
case,
what
was
the
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
those
words,
even
then
unintended
in
those
words
where
you
deliberately,
is
not
what
they
add
up
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
three
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
negligence
in
understanding
the
statute,
understanding
the
rules
or
negligently
going
to
sleep
or
negligently
driving
off
the
road?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
put
inadvertent
in
the
same
place
as
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
negligently
--
look,
well,
let
me
understand
this.
the
man
says
it
is
a
letter
written
to
his
lawyer
and
the
man?
negligently
misunderstands
the
rules
and
burns
that
letter
off,?
is
that
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
is
that
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
possibly
what
they
are
talking
about
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
not
be
though,
could
not
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
negligently
on
the
rules.
what
did
he
say
about
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
negligence
as
i
understand
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
violate.
do
you
understand
the
meaning
of
violated
the
rules,
inadvertently?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
violate
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
trial
would
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
there
be
a
1983
clause
of
action
for
violation
of
his
religious
freedom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
scheuer's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
the
scheuer's
case
said
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
way
to
apply
is
for
the
guard
to
say
as
he
would
shoot
them,
that
i
am
shooting
you
to
deny
you
your
constitutional
rights
as
this
court
said
in
the
scheuer's
case,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
which
means
he
had
to
say
he
had
to
say
when
shooting
him,
i
am
shooting
you
for
the
purpose
of
denying
your
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
adams
do
you
think
that
we
realize
that
when
we
voted
to
take
this
case?
well,
could
not
you
assume
that
and
proceed
with
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
saves
judicial
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
carelessness
under
1983
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
certainly
1983
was
ku
klux
clan
act
and
they
were
not
killed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah
i
read
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
quite
a
lot
in
the
other
side
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
would
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
do
about
the
mail
truck
questions?
the
mail
truck
deliberately
runs
upon
the
curb
and
hits
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
careless
driving
that
is
the
14th
time
he
did
it,
[laughter],
does
that
valid
1983?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
just
near
to
that.
if
you
drive
the
mail
truck
upon
the
curb
13
times
in
a
period
of
two
years
and
hit
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
the
mail
truck
driver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
he
did
was
he
ran
through
a
red
light?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
my
real
problem
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
you
say
you
want
to
prove
that
these
people
deliberately
denied
them
the
rights
because
they
did
not
understand
the
regulations.
whatever
you
are
trying
to
say,
why
did
you
not
say
it,
you
are
stuck
with
your
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
why
did
you
say
that
you
are
only
talking
about
negligence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
i
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
that
because
i
have
not
seen
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
go
and
read
them
till
after
the
case
is
argued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
say
they
are
only
talking
about
this
negligence
and
to
me
negligence
means
a
grandeur's
red
light.
to
me
when
you
say
negligence,
i
do
not
get
the
idea
that
you
mean
somebody
deliberately
misread
rules
or
regulations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
shall.
you
used
the
word
shall
which
is
a
intent
(inaudible)
fourteenth
amendment,
shall?
