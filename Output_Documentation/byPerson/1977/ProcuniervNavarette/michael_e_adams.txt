mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say,
initially
that
we
are
premature
in
standing
here
before
you
for
the
reason
that
we
have
not
yet
had
our
trial.
we
have
not
yet
developed
the
sufficient
record
to
provide
this
honorable
court
with
the
detailed
information,
the
factual
predicate
to
reach
the
determination
about
whether
and
to
what
extent
negligence
can
stand
as
a
cause
of
action
for
first
amendment
violations.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
the
ninth
circuit
in
reaching
that
determination
was
applying
existing
law
that
many
other
circuits,
indeed
almost
all
of
the
other
circuits
had
already
reached
the
similar
decisions
with
respect
to
and
was
not
purporting
to
or
did
not
carry,
if
you
will,
the
burden
on
its
shoulders
that
i
would
believe
that
this
court
does.
if
this
court
wishes
to
resolve
an
area
that
is
to
some
extent
muddy
and
may
call
for
some
clarification,
then
it
would
simply
seem
to
me
appropriate
that
your
honors
have
the
benefit
of
a
full
and
complete
record,
indicating
just
what
was
going
on
in
relation
to
the
regulation
of
mail
from
defendant
procunier
on
down
to
the
mail
room
clerk.
how
was
responsibility
distributed?
who
was
acting,
who
was
failing
to
act
and
with
what
degrees
of
intent?
we
could
have
anything
here
from
inadvertence
to
gross
negligence
to
recklessness
to
deliberate
conduct
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
extreme
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
e.
adams
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
exactly.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
if
we
then,
i
just
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes
your
honor
that
is
clear
and
in
a
way
that
stands
as
an
argument
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
economy
for
making
the
remand
now
and
watching
the
case
and
allowing
and
considering
to
bringing
of
it
back,
once
the
trail
has
been
had
and
a
sufficient
record
developed
so
that
a
more
decisive
and
clear,
a
more
effectively
--
effective
standard
would
be
more
meaningful
and
provide
more
guidance
to
the
other
circuits
could
then
be
divined.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
certainly,
your
honor.
let
me
just
tax
down
that
initial
point.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
if
it
is
the
worse
then
if
the
court
to
reach
the
determination
at
this
point
in
respect
of
negligence,
let
me
say
that
there
are
two
basic
reasons
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
negligence
should
be
allowed
as
a
cause
of
action
in
respect
of
the
first
amendment
and
they
go
to
the
purposes
of
that
amendment,
the
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind,
those
purposes
being
as
i
understand
them,
deterrence
and
compensation.
in
dealing
first
with
deterrence,
that
this
court
carefully
explored
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
compensation
should
be
provided
and
the
extent
to
which
immunity
should
be
allowed
to
state
officials
in
relation
to
conducts
involving
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
in
the
cases
of
scheuer
v.
rhodes
and
wood
v.
strickland
that
i
am
sure
your
honors
are
extremely
familiar
with,
that
balance
was
struck
with
a
certain
degree
of
deference
given
to
the
importance
of
state
officials
engaging
in
decisive
action
and
in
acknowledgment
that
the
public
interest
called
for
that.
now,
what
we
may
well
have
here
on
the
part
of
those
officials
who
were
exercising
discretion
in
relation
to
the
regulation
of
prisoner
mail,
is
a
failure
to
act,
an
abdication
from
the
exercise
of
any
discretion
of
whatsoever,
a
failure
to
look
at
the
options.
and
if
petitioners'
request
is
honored
by
this
court
and
if
the
opportunity
to
obtain
money
liability
against
such
state
officials
as
those
is
the
effect
of
result
of
a
determination
by
this
court.
that
in
effect
is
granting
absolute
immunity
for
a
complete
abdication.
it
undercuts
the
very
moving
rationale
of
scheuer
v.
rhodes
and
wood
v.
strickland.
if
we
look
for
a
moment
for
guidance
to
the
common
law
as
this
court
has
in
deciding
immunity
questions
in
relation
to
1983,
we
will
find
that
the
common
law
when
it
deals
with
conduct
that
is
not
the
exercise
of
discretion,
but
rather
ministerial
in
character,
liability
negligence
is
generally
allowed,
this
is
the
prevailing
rule.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
l
am
talking
about
limitations
that
1983
would
put
on
litigations
under
any
constitutional
guarantee,
including
the
first
amendment.
in
other
words
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
if
we
assume
in
your
hypothetical
your
honor,
that
common
law
immunities
and
limitations
to
those
common
law
immunities
as
established
for
example
in
california,
govern,
yes
i
would
have
no
problem
with
immunity
because
in
dealing
with
negligence
at
least
in
the
form
of
failure
to
act,
inadvertent
failure
to
act,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
california
has
made
perfectly
clear
the
in
case
that
i
have
cited
in
by
brief
johnson
v.
state
that
even
where
discretion
ought
to
be
exercised,
but
in
the
actual
fact
of
the
instance
it
caused
an
injury,
it
was
not,
then
the
immunity,
that
ordinarily
would
enclose
that
particular
official
or
the
governmental
entity
that
he
represents
is
not
available
and
that
official
stands
fully
exposed
in
negligence
liability
as
though
act
were
ministerial
from
the
outset.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
okay,
i
would
say
not
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
i
quite
agree
with
certain
of
the
questions
by
the
court
addressed
to
the
petitioner
that
my
third
cause
of
action
deals
with
misreading
of
the
regulations
and
it
does
not
purport
to
include
factual
inadvertence
by
subordinates,
subordinate
prison
officials
such
as
posed
in
that
mail
truck
hypothetical.
in
answer,
however,
to
your
hypothetical
and
also
to
a
situation
of
misreading
of
regulations,
such
as
directly
as
raised
in
my
third
amendment,
third
cause
of
action,
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
overall
course
of
action,
the
overall
pattern
or
implied
policy
that
is
being
persuaded
by
the
subordinate
officials
to
decide
if
there
is
liability
or
not
in
other
words,
it
is
a
balancing
test
that
needs
to
be
undergone
and
we
need
to
look
at
the
severity
and
degree
of
the
harmless
being
risked
to
the
people
at
the
--
who
where
subject
to
the
power
of
that
particular
governmental
official
and
i
would
concede
that
in
isolated
instance
of
inadvertent
conduct
by
an
official
who
is
otherwise
prudent,
you
know,
who
is
not
an
official
who
gauges
and
gauges
habitually
in
careless
conduct
be
that
careless
misreading
of
that
regulations
or
be
that
being
careless
in
driving
the
mail
truck
down
the
road
then
there
is
no
liability
under
1983
for
such
an
official.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
indeed
i
would
believe
that
there
is
your
honor
as
i
sought
to
contend.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
certainly
not,
but
the
governmental
official
to
fail
to
track
down
and
bring
the
ku
klux
clanners
to
justice
many
times
were
and
this
is
something
that
was
squarely
in
the
minds
of
the
congress,
the
members
of
congress
who
were
debating
that
and
i
quoted
in
by
brief
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
certain
places
where
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
i
do
not
mean
to
take
up
the
court's
time
with
quotes.
i
probably
as
a
matter,
as
an
upshot
of
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
it
is
rather
ambiguous
quotes
can
be
raised
from
both
sides
and
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
current
position
to
decide
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
it
depends
whether
that
person
has
a
constitutional
right
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
i
think
probably
not
your
honor,
the
distinction
i
want
to
make
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical
is
that
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
involved,
it
is
a
matter
for
the
state
courts.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
if
those
13
times
were
in,
were
each
time
directed
at
picketers,
let
us
say
who
are
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
along
the
sidewalk,
yes,
there
we
have
a
course
of
conduct
and
even
if
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
if
he
is
using
a
government
instrumentality
to
interfere
with
first
amendment
rights
i
think
we
got
1983
cause
of
action,
but
if
they
were
simply
pedestrians
or
people
that
he
did
not
like
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
i
would
adhere
to
the
distinction
of
a
nice
worded
instance
versus
a
course
of
conduct.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
although
that
really
seems
to
his
intentionality
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
why
did
not
i
say
in
the
complaint?
mr.
michael
e.
adams
because
from
the
two
items
of
mail
where
there
are
any
facts
at
all
in
regard
to
what
happened,
it
would
appear
that
what
occurred
was
just
a
blatantly
negligent
misreading
of
the
applications.
we
have
eight
items
of
mail
that
were
returned
to
mr
navarette
from
the
correction
of
counselors
named
in
the
complaint
and
why
did
they
return
that
mail
to
him
because
the
mail
was
not
legal,
not
business
and
not
personal
they
said
in
their
note
to
him.
now,
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulations
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
your
honor,
now
it
is
in
here
and
i
can
give
you
about
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
i
believe
that
it
is
physically
in
the
clerk's
office
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes
your
honor.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
that
is
been
put
in
front
of
court.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
certainly
not
deliberately
misread
rules
and
regulations
and
if
that
is
what
we
have,
then
my
existing
causes
of
action
that
are
not
before
this
court
would
cover
the
matter,
but
if
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
sloppy
misreading
of
the
regulations
or
sloppy
practices
in
terms
of
unwritten,
the
unwritten
supplemental
rules
that
may
well
exist
at
the
soledad
prison
level
that
i
do
not
know
about
yet
because
all
i
have
received
in
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
a
state-wide
regulations
that
procunier
himself
drafted.
i
do
not
know
what
existed
at
the
state,
at
the
prison
level,
but
there
may
well
have
been
negligent
misinterpretation
of
things
there.
the
refusal
send
the
packet
of
drafts,
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
december
of
1971
after
the
prison
law
project,
may
would
have
been
a
negligent
misunderstanding
by
the
mail
room
clerk
as
to
his
duties
in
the
matter.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
certainly
no
personal
injury
form
book
was
used
by
me
in
drafting
this
complaint.
it
was
an
attempt
to
match
the
law
under
1983
with
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
understood
it.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
25
items
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
he
miscounts.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
how
many
were
not
delivered?
mr.
michael
e.
adams
opposing
counsel
is
correct
on
that
when
he
says
something
over
115,
my
counting
would
indicate
160
to
170
is
a
rather
illegible
mail
lot
that
was
supplied
by
petitioner
at
the
time
of
summary
judgment,
that
is
part
of
this
record
and
it
is
difficult
to
count
from
it,
but
it
is
something
over
150.
so
we
are
talking
about
1
in
6
or
1
in
7
of
this
man
--
a
ratio
of
1
to
6
or
1
to
7
of
this
man's
mail
were
interfered
with.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
it
may
well
your
honor.
at
this
point
i
do
not
know
i
need
to
find
that
out.
this
is
simply
another
reason
why
we
have
an
insufficient
record
in
to,
my
view
for
the
court
to
make
a
determination.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
concept
that
can
neither
be
plugged
into
1983
or
taken
out
of
1983,
whole
class.
we
are
talking
about
a
concept
of
reasonableness
in
relation
to
risk
to
find
whether
that
is
already
interwoven
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
the
qualified
immunity
decisions.
that
depends
on
the
meaning
of
particular
amendments
and
i
would
point
out
your
honors
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
respondents'
position
here
does
not
open
any
pandora's
box
for
a
greater
volume
of
cases
because
we
are
talking
about
a
decision
simply
in
relation
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes
and
my
answer
in
brief
to
that
your
honor
would
be
that
there
is
no
bar
within
the
intrinsic
meaning
of
the
first
amendment
to
negligence
such
as
there
is
in
the
eighth
amendment,
intrinsically
that
calls
for
deliberate
in
different
standard.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
for
example,
i
would
agree
with
counsel
that
this
court
has
found
a
requirement
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
acting
state
officials
intrinsic
in
that
particular
constitutional
guarantee.
however
when
we
look
at
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes,
i
would
--
that
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is,
you
know,
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
supports
the
meaning
of
intent.
not
all
constitution
guarantees
are
framed
in
terms
of
the
state
of
mind
of
the
acting
state
official
and
the
first
amendment
is
one
of
those.
it
does
not,
if
your
honors
would
consider
cases
like
edwards
v.
south
carolina,
feiner
v.
new
york,
cases
that
involved
police
conduct
with
situations
that
are
unruly,
possibly
involved
disturbing
of
the
peace,
we
have
a
speaker
or
some
marchers
exercising
first
amendment
rights.
the
question
about
whether
first
amendment
rights
were
involved
there
or
not
does
not
turn
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
police
official.
it
does
not
turn
on
whether
he
was
exercising
the
utmost
diligence
in
protecting
their
rights
or
rather
he
was
a
little
bit
reckless
or
negligent
or
whatever
you
might
say
in
regard
to
those
rights.
it
does
not
turn
on
that,
but
rather
the
independent
examination
by
this
court
of
the
record.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
an
intent
obstacle
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
it
says
there
shall
be
no
law.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
but
when
we
go
beyond
the
making
of
the
laws
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
in
relation
to
the
initial
maker
of
the
law,
but
then
those
laws
are
applied
and
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes
your
honor,
i
would
be
in
agreement
with
that
--
on
in
--
i
seek
to
provide
a
comprehensive
opportunity
for
my
client
to
prove
in
court
that
in
one
way
or
another,
in
the
intentional,
whether
in
through
the
deliberate
drafting
of
the
law
or
whether
the
--
to
an
negligent
follow
up
in
the
preparation
of
those
regulations,
be
that
follow
up
on
the
part
of
the
supervisory
defendants
in
failing
to
train
or
supervise
or
get
feedback
from
the
defendants
on
the
lines
so
to
speak
in
terms
of
mail
evaluation
or
negligence
in
terms
of
the
defendants
on
the
line
in
terms
of
trying
in
it
with
some
modicum
of
prudence
and
diligence
to
be
consistent,
to
follow
the
--
would
at
least
to
be
a
reasonable
meaning
of
those
regulations
than
those
rights
have
been
violated.
there
are
few
other
points
that
i
would
like
briefly
advert
to
that
arose
in
the
questions
of
the
petitioning
attorney.
first
of
all
briefly
in
relation
to
the
right
of
access.
i
would
say
at
length
on
footnote
2,
page
3
of
my
brief,
why
i
--
i
now
press
it
even
though
indeed
i
did
not,
now
in
much
respect
and
advisably
concede
the
right
of
access
in
written
argument,
both
before
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
i,
in
terms
of
the
coverage,
the
constitutional
coverage
of
the
conduct
here
involved,
the
sending
and
receiving
of
--
well,
the
sending
of
mail,
the
first
amendment
free
expression
as
i
see
it
is
completely
coterminous
with
the
right
of
access.
the
distinction
then,
the
materiality
of
the
right
of
access
has
to
do
only
with
the
history
of
the
development
of
these
rights.
the
right
of
exercise
is
an
older
right
and
has
a
longer
history
to
it.
the
distinction
in
my
view
became
more
material,
when
wood
v.
strickland
was
decided
because
i
talked
about
settled
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
there
is
a
--
well
there
is
--
if
this
court
were
to
take
petitioner's
view
that
only
in
a
--
only
a
decision
by
this
court
itself
were
to
establish
a
right
to
be
settled
within
the
meaning
wood
v.
strickland
then
obviously
i
am
out
in
cold
as
far
as
free
expression
goes
because
although
as
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
there
were
some
district
court
decisions,
that
in
my
view
reasonably
and
very
clearly
let
defendant
procunier
know
he
being
party
in
a
couple
of
those
suits
and
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
defendants
know,
that
there
was
prisoner
free
expression
already,
reasonably
and
advance
in
1971-72.
there
is
no
decision
by
this
court
until
martinez
v.
procunier
where
there
was
the
beginning
of
that
acknowledgment
of
that
right
and
then
payne
v.
procunier
was
shortly
thereafter
where
it
was
made
express.
indeed
prisoners
have
a
certain
measure
of
first
amendment
for
the
expression.
in
terms
of
right
of
access,
johnson
v.
avery
was
decided
much
earlier
and
that
would
have
--
could
have
been
a
foundation
for
at
least
that
rate.
so
indeed
candidly
i
made
the
our
concession
before.
if
the
court
wants
to
deal
with
the
question
of
--
that
i
think
really
is
not
properly
before
this
court,
there
is
a
matter
of
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted,
but
if
the
court
should
wish
to
deal
what
with
it,
i
would
suggest
that
it
might
in
the
interest
of
making
a
decision
that
gives
good
guidance
to
the
circuit
courts
and
the
lower
federal
courts
will
be
reading
this
decision
to
look
at
all
the
rights
--
the
facts
fairly
raised
and
i
think
that
the
facts,
do
fairly
raise
right
of
access
as
well
as
free
expression.
there
is
another
question
that
maybe
in
the
minds
of
this
court,
in
relation
to
the
allowing
of
negligence
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
briefly
and
that
is
whether
the
relief
that
might
be
available
in
state
court,
is
it
really
sufficient
for
the
kind
of
harm
that
we
are
speaking
of
here?
and
i
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
is
really
not.
that
we
need
a
federal
forum,
the
forum
of
1983
and
a
federal
perspective
in
order
to
properly
grant
a
compensatory
relief
because
we
are
talking
about
different
interest,
not
just
common
law
interest,
injury
to
person,
injury
to
property,
we
are
talking
about
constitutional
interests.
and
as
justice
harlin
said
very
eloquently
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
roe
v.
pape,
those
interests
are
fundamentally
different
in
character
and
often
would
call
for
different
measure
of
damages
in
order
to
provide
compensation.
for
example
in
the
troy
v.
dallas
case,
356
u.s.
involving
a
decision
by
this
court
that
eighth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
denationalization
of
an
individual.
there
is
no
physical
mistreatment,
but
yet
that
the
total
destruction
of
the
individual's
status
in
an
organized
society
violated
that
constitutional
right.
there
would
have
been
no
damages
in
common
law
and
what
about
the
right
of
an
individual
to
vote
or
to
attend
an
integrated
school,
what
is?
the
common
law
on
money
damages
there,
and
what
about
mr.
navarette
right
here,
common
law
perspective
handful
of
mail
what
is
at
work?
but
when
we
look
at
it
from
a
constitutional
perspective,
we
are
talking
about
this
man's
effort
to
communicate
with
the
world
outside
and
that
has
a
certain
value
in
terms
of
rehabilitation
of
this
man.
when
a
person
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
yes
your
honor
and
although
this
has
not
been
squarely
decided
by
this
court,
i
would
submit
that
if
a
court
would,
it
would
be
an
logical
and
plausible
extension
from
the
immunity
decisions
that
this
court
has
made
that
negligence
should
lie,
then
the
court
has
looked
in
the
past
and
in
wood
v.
strickland
and
scheuer
v.
rhodes
to
the
common
law
for
guidance.
and
if
we
look
here
to
the
common
law,
we
will
find
that
state
officials,
the
public
officials
are
subject
to
negligence
liability
where
their
acts
are
ministerial
in
character
and
not
the
active
exercise
of
discretion
and
all
i
am
asking
--
mr.
michael
e.
adams
what
is
that
now?
mr.
michael
e.
adams
that
would
be,
i
would
indicate,
that
would
be
a
liability
in
the
state
courts,
that
is
the
way
common
law
resolves
that
problem.
in
--
well,
that
is
not
something
that
should
be
followed
as
an
automatic
matter
in
dealing
with
1983.
it
is
--
there
being
a
greater
interest
in
attaching
liability
because
the
purpose
after
all
of
1983
is
to
provide
relief
for
the
infliction
of
constitutional
harm
by
state
officials,
we
should
at
least
go
as
far
as
the
common
law
goes
and
on
that
basis
i
would
urge
that
negligence
be
allowed.
thank
you.
