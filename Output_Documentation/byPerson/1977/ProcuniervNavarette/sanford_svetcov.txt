mr.
sanford
svetcov
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
at
the
outset
reserve
have
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
is
a
complaint
alleging
that
state
prison
officials
negligently
lost
13
items
of
a
prisoner's
outgoing
mail
in
1971
and
1972,
states
a
cause
of
action
under
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
this
question
reached
this
court
in
the
following
way.
on
january
4th,
1974,
respondent
navarette,
with
his
present
counsel,
filed
a
second
amended
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
solely
for
damages.
he
alleged
that
while
he
was
a
california
prisoner,
in
1971
and
1972
at
soledad
prison,
13
items
of
his
outgoing
mail
were
not
received
by
his
addressee's.
in
his
first
and
second
causes
of
action,
he
alleged
that
the
defendant
deliberately
refused
to
send
this
letters,
either
one,
in
knowing
disregard
or
two
in
bad
faith
disregard
of
prisoner's
first
amendment
right
of
free
expression.
these
causes
of
actions
are
not
before
the
court.
in
his
third
cause
of
action,
it
is
alleged
that
the
letters
were
not
received
because
of
the
defendant
negligently
and
inadvertently
mishandled
the
mail.
it
is
this
cause
of
action
and
only
this
cause
of
action
which
is
before
this
court.
now,
there
is
one
matter
your
honor
i
would
like
to
set
to
one
side
at
this
time.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
respondent's
brief
in
this
court
that
the
claim
of
mail
loss
involved
or
resulted
in
a
denial
of
access
to
the
courts
as
well
as
the
denial
of
free
expression.
that
is
not
the
case.
i
must
point
out
that
in
the
lower
courts
respondent
expressly
stated
following
?the
claim
against
mail
interference
does
not
purport
to
allege
denial
of
access
to
the
courts?
and
we
take
counsel
and
respondent
at
his
word,
he
told
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
you
find
that
in
the
record
at
page
17.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
it
was
not
printed
for
the
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
record
that
was
sent
from
ninth
circuit
to
this
court.
it
also
appears
in
the
reply
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
page
7
and
page
9.
now
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
yes.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
am
not
saying
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i
am
just
trying
to
clear
up
a
matter
that
seems
to
have
reappeared
in
the
briefs
in
this
court
that
i
thought
had
been
cleared
up
early
and
was
not
before
this
court
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear
that
denial
of
access
is
not
in
question
here?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
correct.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
no,
california
has
a
procedure
for
suing
public
officials
who
act
negligently
and
so
--
in
tort
law
and
it
would
not
be
constitutional
cause
of
action
at
all.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
in
the
last
two
years
that
they
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
under
section
1983
and
would
entertain,
and
the
state
courts
may
entertain
1983
causes
of
action
in
the
state
courts?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
probably
not.
i
think
that
there
would
be
an
independent
state
causes
of
action
available?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
respondent
assert
an
inmate's
right,
a
free
expression
in
the
mail.
i
have
to
remind
the
court,
and
again
and
again,
that
it
is
the
inmate
who
is
bringing
the
suit.
it
is
not
the
addressee's
and
that
kind
of
gets
me
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument
now,
but
the
point
we
make
in
second
part
of
our
argument
in
our
briefs
is
that
in
procunier
v.
martinez
in
1974,
this
court
did
not
find
a
right
of
free
expression
in
the
inmate,
it
found
of
right
of
free
expression
in
the
free
person
corespondent.
now,
if
the
free
person
corespondents
would
bring
in
this
lawsuit,
perhaps
we
would
have
a
different
case
in
so
far
as
what
the
constitutional
right
was
involved.
we
may
not
have
a
different
case
in
so
far
as
whether
negligence
or
intent
is
before
us.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
absolutely
not
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
my
understanding
of
1983
is
that
you
do
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983,
unless
you
can
first
find
the
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
think
that
if
the
truck
went
off
the
road
every
day
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
accidentally,
that
a
cause
of
action
could
be
stated
under
your
honor's
formulation
in
estelle
v.
gamble
that
that
might
constitute
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
claim
of
deliberating
difference
and
respondents
here
have
two
claims
of
intentional
tort
of
deliberate
refusal,
a
deliberate
indifference
under
which
he
may
attempt
to
assert
that
what
happened
to
him
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
allegation
in
this
compliant
is
that
13
items
of
mail
over
a
period
of
one-and-half
years
were
not
delivered.
i
should
point
out
your
honor
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
over
150
pieces
of
special
purpose
mail,
that
is
mail
to
attorney's,
reporters,
courts,
public
officials
were
mailed
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
and
this
is
in
addition
to
routine
corespondent
to
family
and
friends
of
which
no
record
is
kept
in
the
california
prison
system.
so
what
we
are
looking
at
is
13
pieces
of
mail,
out
of
at
least
more
than
150
that
records
were
kept
of,
we
do
not
know
how
many
more
of
which
no
records
are
kept.
your
honor
in
a
case
l
tried
in
the
us
district
court
two
years
ago
concerning
san
quentin
prison,
a
prison
comparable
in
size
to
soledad,
the
record
was
undisputed
that
over
three
to
four
thousand
pieces
of
mail
were
handled
per
day.
if
you
translate
that
into
year-and-a-half,
you
are
talking
in
excess
of
one-and-half
million
pieces
of
mail
and
all
we
have
a
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
13
pieces
were
lost
in
that
period.
13
out
of
one-and-half
million
is
a
very
small
fraction.
we
have
no
other
allegation
in
this
compliant
that
any
other
prisoners
were
subjected
to
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
thirteen
pieces
were
lost.
yes
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
complaint.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
let
me
quote
from
respondent's
brief
to
this
court
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
or
that
he
thought
he
following
a
regulation
and
just
misread
it?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
in
this
court,
respondent
states
the
following.
that
the
mail
was?
unaccountably
lost
or
mislaid
due
to
inadvertent
mishandling?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
now,
there
was
one
piece
of
mail
in
which
he
makes
a
specific
allegation
that
it
was
refused
mailing
and
that
then
a
reason
was
given
for
the
refusal,
but
i
find
that
not
to
bear
on
this
negligence
claim
because
there
was
a
deliberate
refusal
and
a
reason
was
given
that
does
not
fall
within
our
negligence
cause
of
action.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
justice
rehnquist
that
might
be
true
in
the
ordinary
case
where
only
one
cause
of
action
was
alleged,
but
the
fact
is
in
this
case
three
causes
of
action
are
alleged
with
respect
to
the
mail
and
in
the
first
two
the
allegations
are
that
there
was
a
deliberate
refusal
to
send
the
mail,
deliberate
refusal.
now,
in
the
third
cause
of
action,
the
allegation
is
a
negligent
and
inadvertent
mishandling
and
i
take
it
--
and
misapplication
of
the
regulation,
but
i
take
that
to
mean
pure
carelessness,
not
that
they
misunderstood
the
rules.
i
took
that
to
be
what
was
happening
with
respect
to
the
deliberate
refusal.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well
your
honor,
as
i
understand
these
three
causes
of
action,
as
they
have
been
pleaded
through
four
complaints
in
the
lower
courts,
they
were
dealt
with
below
as
two
causes
of
action
for
deliberate
refusal,
a
third
cause
of
action
for
negligent
loss
of
the
mail,
that
is
the
way
they
have
been
dealt
with
below.
this
is
not
a
haynes
v.
kind
of
situation
where
respondent
does
not
have
counsel,
he
has
counsel.
the
counsel
was
the
same
counsel
throughout
from
the
second
amendment
complaint
on
and
i
have
to
take
counsel
at
his
word
that
what
he
means
by
his
complaint
is
that
the
mail
was
unaccountably
lost
or
mislaid
due
to
inadvertent
mishandling.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
if
under
any
conceivable
facts,
if
the
allegation
is
confiscation,
it
seems
to
me
that
confiscation
can
be
dealt
with
a
trial
under
the
twin
allegations
that
are
not
before
this
court,
namely
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
that
is
the
kind
of
negligence
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
stated
a
cause
of
action
and
that
is
the
kind
of
negligence
we
took
in
our
petition
to
certiorari
to
this
court
to
ask
this
court
to
say
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
only
if
it
was
construed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief
for
a
deliberate
indifference
and
that
the
confiscation
was
repeated,
was
so
repeated
as
to
constitute
a
deliberate
indifference
to
the
right
of
free
expression,
but
to
say
that
an
active
inadvertence
and
mistake
constitutes
a
constitutional
deprivation
and
opposed
to
a
tort,
i
have
difficulty
with
construing
as
a
constitutional
deprivation.
my
point
is,
is
that
if
it
happens
often
enough
as
a
alleged,
the
answer
is
that
causes
of
action
in
deliberate
indifference
recognized
by
this
court.
it
is
not
in
a
windfall
cause
of
action
in
negligence.
in
other
words,
negligence
is
traditionally
dealt
with
in
tort
law.
let
us
put
ourselves
in
the
area
of
injunctive
relief.
i
suppose
that
if
respondent
was
seeking
an
injunction,
he
could
by
requesting
a
simple
order
and
do
away
with
an
entire
body
of
top
tort
law.
all
the
public
officials
will
be
told
thou
shall
not
be
negligent
and
i
am
sure
a
district
court
can
enter
such
an
order,
but
whether
such
an
order
would
be
efficacious
is
doubt
and
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
1983
is
a
deterrent
statute
and
not
a
compensation
statute
and
the
deterrence
that
it
seeks
that
is
it
is
aimed
at
is
the
deterrence
of
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
your
honor
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
negligence,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
unintended,
unintended
conduct
which
resulted
in
a
loss
to
the
plaintiff,
unintended
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
allegation
in
causes
of
action
one
and
two
is
deliberate.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
allegation
in
cause
number
three
has
not
been
construed
to
be
an
allegation
of
deliberate
refusal.
it
has
been
construed
to
be
an
allegation
of
negligence.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
the
complaint
alleges
negligent
and
inadvertent
misapplication
of
the
rules.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
put
it
in
the
same
place
because
if
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
says
defendants
negligently
and
inadvertently
misapplied
the
prisoner
mail
regulations
and
as
i
understand
inadvertence
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
he
burns
it
up?
mr.
sanford
svetcov
no
that
is
not
negligence.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
they
are
talking
about
at
all.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
mi
have
to
take
counsel
at
his
word
when
he
says
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
unaccountably
lost
or
mislaid
due
to
inadvertent
mishandling.
he
is
not
talking
about
burning
it
up
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
he
said
negligently
and
inadvertently
misapplied
the
rules.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
your
honor
that
may
well
be
true.
the
point
is
that
is
the
understanding
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
and
unintentionally,
yes.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
appears
to
be
the
case
or
at
least
he
misapplied
them,
whether
violated
mis
apply
are
the
same
thing,
i
do
not
know.
he
may
have
applied
a
different
rule
to
--
a
rule
to
the
wrong
type
of
mail.
that
is
one
way
of
showing
it.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
at
the
trial
we
will
still
find
it
out
because
there
can
be
a
trial
under
the
first
and
second
causes
of
action,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
there
was
a
limited
grant.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
the
certified
question
reach
as
follows
justice
white.
whether
negligent
failure
to
mail
certain
of
a
prisoner's
outgoing
letters
states
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983.
this
was
addressed
to
the
determination
of
the
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
oh!
yes,
that
is
our
position.
that
is
correct.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
issue
is
herein
so
far
as
the
negligence
claim
is
concerned
because
even
as
to
the
negligence
claim
there
must
be
an
underlying
constitutional
deprivation
and
regrettably
your
honors
did
not
certify
the
first
two
questions
because
we
would
have
welcomed,
we
would
be
happy
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
was
no
first
amendment
deprivation
in
1971
and
1972,
even
if
there
was
deliberate
refusal
to
something
like
that.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well
we
argue
it,
but
we
do
argue
it
as
a
backstop
to
the
negligence.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
subsumed
in
the
question
certified.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
absolutely
correct
and
that
is
what
your
honor
said
in
procunier
v.
martinez.
that
prior
to
that
case
the
state
of
the
law
as
to
prisoner
mail
was
totally
uncertain
and
prison
officials
had
no
basis
for
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
procunier
v.
martinez
applies
precisely
to
our
defendants.
how
are
they
expected
to
anticipate
this
court's
decision
in
1974.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
correct.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
that
is
right.
you
could
resolve
the
case
that
way.
we
had
hoped
that
this
case
would
be
decided
on
the
lead
point,
whether
under
any
circumstances,
negligence,
negligent
action
could
invade
a
constitutional
right
and
our
position
on
that
is
as
stated
in
our
brief
is
that
that
cannot
and
should
not.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
your
honors
have
decided
a
number
of
cases
on
about
a
number
of
constitutional
rights
and
i
can
think
of
no
case
yet
decided
by
this
court,
where
you
did
not
require
some
sort
of
intent
and
i
am
thinking
of
washington
v.
davis
where
you
say
there
has
to
be
a
purposeful
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
am
thinking
of
estelle
v.
gamble.
there
has
to
be
a
deliberate
indifference
before
you
can
have
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
i
am
thinking
of
the
whole
body
of
fourth
amendment
law.
all
illegal
arrest
and
illegal
searches
and
seizures
are
deliberate
acts.
in
bishop
v.
wood,
you
honor,
in
the
due
process
case
involving
the
employer
and
the
employee
that
justice
stevens
wrote,
my
recollection
of
your
language
is
that
the
due
process
clause
was
not
to
be
used
as
a
means
for
federal
course
to
resolve
all
mistakes
by
public
officials
that
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
motive
to
deprive
of
a
right.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
that
reminds
me
of
some
hypotheticals
in
amicus'
brief.
the
first
hypothetical
was
that
if
a
prisoner
was
walking
across
the
exercise
yard
and
negligently
run
down
by
a
truck
driver,
that
was
--
that
he
would
concede
did
not
state
a
clause
of
action,
but
somehow
if
the
prisoner
was
walking
across
the
yard,
and
was
on
his
way
to
church,
that
would
invade
his
first
amendment
right
to
worship
and
i
simply
cannot
see
that
unless
the
truck
driver
knew
that
the
fellow
was
going
to
church
and
ran
him
down
that
how
the
first
amendment
right
could
be
implicated.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
right.
ran
him
down
deliberately.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
not
negligibly.
he
could
not
--
if
he
knew
of
the
right
and
he
ran
him
down,
i
think
an
inference
would
be
drawn.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
we
could
try
him
in
the
state
court
for
murder.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
we
try
him
in
state
court
for
murder.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
as
i
understand
this
court's
decisions,
there
has
to
be
a
combination
of
an
intent
to
do
the
act
and
a
consciousness
that
in
some
fashion,
that
his
constitutional
right
would
be
implicated.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
you
know
that
the
debates
on
this
act
considered
that
when
in
connection
with
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
act
and
if
you
recall
the
original
version
of
that
act,
listed
a
certain
number
of
crimes,
murder,
mayhem,
assault
with
respect
to
the
ku
klux
clan
and
the
opponents
pointed
out
that
the
due
process
clause
has
never
been
sought
to
protect
life,
liberty
or
property.
those
--
that
those
kinds
of
actions
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
intentional
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
cruel
and
unusual
punishment's
implicated.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
just
said
that
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
it
said
that
the
word
willfully
in
section
242
of
18
u.s.c
required
proof
either
by
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
defendant
intended
to
deprive
the
victim
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
yes,
either
to
say
that
or
have
told
someone
that
on
his
way
to
the
shooting.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
ever
held
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
debates
about
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sanford
svetcov
in
addition
to
the
murder,
a
cause
of
action
in
state
court.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
understand
that
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
could
?
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
certainly.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
well,
you
know
that
truck
driver
thought
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
just
before
he
went
of
the
road
too.
he
thought
he
was
driving
a
beautiful
automobile.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
think
it
is
the
same.
i
have
been
thoroughly
distracted
from
my
argument,
your
honor,
but
i
feel
that
all
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
cover
have
been
covered.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
thank
you
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
stated
the
section,
referring
to
section
1983
place,
places
no
narrow
limitation
on
the
nature
or
quality
of
the
conduct
which
makes
it
actionable,
but
concerns
itself
entirely
with
the
consequences
of
that
conduct.
mr.
sanford
svetcov
i
am
reading
from
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
7,
and
then
on
page
8
it
goes
on
to
say
the
allegations
that
state
officers
negligently
deprived
him
of
those
rights
referring
to
the
first
amendment
rights,
states
a
1083
cause
of
action.
we
filed
our
writ
from
that
ruling.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
construed
the
third
cause
of
action
to
state
a
clause
of
action
in
negligence.
if
this
court
or
majority
of
this
court
reads
it
as
stating
some
other
cause
of
action
as
habitual
misreading
of
statute
and
regulations
reads
to
us
deliberate
in
difference
and
he
does
not
need
a
negligence
cause
of
action
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
so
far
as
it
has
held
that
negligence
states
the
cause
of
action
was
misreading
what
this
complaint
was
all
about.
but
the
court,
i
think
should
go
further
and
unequivocally
hold
that
if
it
does
indeed
allege
negligence
because
he
must
mean
negligence
here,
he
said
deliberate
in
difference
in
his
first
two
causes
of
action,
then
we
decide
that
under
no
circumstances
does
negligence
state
a
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions,
particularly
in
estelle
v.
gamble,
paul
v.
davis,
rizzo
v.
goode,
support
the
proposition
that
negligence
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983.
the
pattern
of
error
by
subordinate
officials
has
to
be
something
more
than
negligence.
it
has
got
to
be
egregious
wide
spread
and
continuing
as
to
permit
an
inference
of
deliberating
difference
and
we
have
been
deliberating
difference
to
mean
some
sort
of
informative
intentional
conduct
or
a
refusal
to
act
upon
a
clear
duty.
now,
i
want
to
clear
up
the
point
that
whether
there
are
13
items
or
25
items
that
justice
powell
raised.
the
complaint
lists
13
items
have
mailed
justice
powell.
it
is
true
that
some
of
those
were
apparently
have
a
multiple
addressees
and
i
think
one
of
the
items
was
reproduced
eight
times
and
put
in
eight
different
envelops
and
sent
and
when
it
was
turned
in
there
were
a
package
of
eight
alleged,
but
that
is
one
item
of
eight,
so
if
you
add
up
the
multiples
it
comes
up
to
25
letters
in
respondent's
departments,
but
we
accept
his
listing
of
13
items.
there
were
13
letters
as
we
see
it,
some
of
them
had
multiple
copies,
to
clear
that
up.
now,
i
have
a
fairness
question
that
i
have
difficulty
in
dealing
with.
the
counsel
seems
say
that
mr.
procunier,
the
director
of
the
california
department
of
corrections
should
have
known
about
the
inmates'
first
amendment
right
of
free
expression
back
in
1971
and
72
because
he
was
in
court,
the
lower
courts,
district
court
and
circuit
court
litigating
the
question
but
mr.
procunier
was
here
on
1974
and
this
court
did
not
tell
him
anything
about
the
inmates'
right
of
free
expression
and
i
have
a
--
there
is
a
basic
unfairness
and
telling
him
now
you
should
have
known
it.
in
1972,
when
he
was
not
told
about
it
in
1974,
and
i
had
submitted
on
that.
thank
you
your
honor.
