well,
you
do
argue
that
in
your
brief,
at
least
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
subsumed
in
the
question,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
deliberate
interference
with
the
mail
would
not
constitute
a
constitutional
violation
then
a
fortiori
a
negligent
one
does
not,
that
is
the
point
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
another
way
of
putting
that
might
be
that
some
constitutional
rights
are
rights
against
deliberate
action,
that
the
right
itself
is
against
deliberate
action,
not
against
negligence?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
--
if
a
mail
truck
negligently
hits
somebody
on
his
way
to
church,
he
would
hardly
have
a
claim
that
the
government
had
interfered
with
his
free
exercise
of
religion?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
need
to
concede
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
deliberate
conduct
counselor?
justice
potter
stewart
in
so
far
as
the
conduct
may
have
been
deliberate
that
is
covered
by
your
first
two
causes
of
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
are
not
a
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
presence
posture
of
the
case
there
is
no
question
however
this
court
decides
this
case
that
here
you
got
to
remand
for
a
trail
on
your
first
two
causes
of
action
that
is
clear,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
first
amendment
says
shall
also
so,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
congress
shall
make
no
law.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
of
the
press,
says
shall
same
as
legal
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
you
wanted
to
be
completely
literal
as
with
a
first
amendment
case
at
all,
because
that
does
not
involve
congress,
does
not
it?
