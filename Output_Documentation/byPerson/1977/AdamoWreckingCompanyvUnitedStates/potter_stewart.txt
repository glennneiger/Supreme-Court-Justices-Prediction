justice
potter
stewart
but
did
leedom
not
involve
a
certification
of
a
bargaining
unit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
not
review
always
available
on
an
ada-5
violation
for
refusal
of
the
bargain?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
that
is
the
normal
way
in
which
it
is
reviewable,
it
is
reviewable
thousands
of
times
a
year
by
the
board,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
refuses
to
bargain
and
he
can
refuse
to
bargain
because
he
says
this
is
not
the
appropriate
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
happen
because
leedom
said
that
an
appeal
was
allowable
before
it
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
said
it
did
not
change
the
law
when
it
says
that
where
is
the
statute
now,
not
the
legislative
history,
the
august
1977
statute,
talks
about
when
it
is
not
being
feasible
to
prescribe
an
emission
standard,
the
administrator
may
instead
promulgate
work
practice
standard.
that
sounds
like
they
are
two
different
animals,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
know,
but
by
referring
to
the
legislative
history?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
says
i
have
left
some
language
out
if
you
know,
design
equipment,
work
practice
or
operational
standards,
what
we
are
involved
with
here
is
a
work
practice
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
very
exclusive?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
indicates
they
are
different
things,
if
you
have
to
call
them
by
different
names,
does
it
not?
