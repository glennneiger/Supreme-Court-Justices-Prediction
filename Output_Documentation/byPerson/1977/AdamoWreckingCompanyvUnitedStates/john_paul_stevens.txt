justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
did
not
give
them
too
much
of
a
chance,
did
you?
i
mean,
you
could
have
gone
to
the
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
well
in
other
proceedings
has
agency
said
that
this
was
an
emission
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook
may
i
stop
you
there?
could
he
have
raised
it
on
the
theory
that
it
was
an
emission
standard
under
section
112
within
the
meaning
of
307
(b)
(1)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
controls,
(b)
(2)
says
that
you
are
barred
unless
you
file
the
petition
for
review
as
authorized
by
(b)
(1),
(b)(1)
authorizes
a
petition
for
review
of
the
--
the
action
that
administrator
in
promulgating
any
admission
standard.
so
for
us
to
conclude
that
he
should
have
followed
that
procedure
need
we
not
decide
that
it
was
not
an
emission
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
easterbrook,
there
is
a
rather
clear
difference
between
what
the
statute
says
in
the
category
you
describe
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
the
like.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
statute
purports
to
preclude
review
because
you
are
dealing
with
an
emission
standard
albeit
one
that
is
arbitrary
or
erroneous,
but
if
your
question
is
whether
or
not
it
is
an
emission
standard,
the
statute,
it
is
true
that
you
have
to
decide
the
merits
to
decide
the
jurisdiction
issue,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
is
an
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
the
new
statute
that
i
do
not,
it
may
be
clear
from
the
text,
but
i
am
not
sure,
that
the
statute,
did
the
congress
also
amend
307
(b)
at
the
same
time
to
make
it
clear
that
review
of
the
work
practice
rule
would
be
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lipnick,
if
we
should
be
persuaded
that
the
jurisdictional
issue
depends
on
whether
or
not
it
is
an
emission
standard,
and
you
have
to
decide
the
merits
to
decide
whether
307
(b)
(2)
applied.
in
your
view,
should
this
court
decide
that
question
or
should
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
that
question
as
i
remember?
