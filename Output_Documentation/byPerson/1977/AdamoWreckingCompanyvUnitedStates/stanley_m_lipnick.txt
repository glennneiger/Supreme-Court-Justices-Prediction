mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
arising
under
the
clean
air
act
as
it
stood
prior
to
the
amendment
of
this
past
summer.
section
112
(b)
of
the
as
it
then
stood,
instructed
the
administrator
of
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency
to
promulgate
an
emission
standard
to
control
emissions
of
hazardous
air
pollutants,
one
of
which
is
asbestos.
the
administrator
issued
a
work
practice
regulation
for
demolition
operations
and
gave
it
the
title
emission
standard.
section
112
(c)
of
the
act
prohibits
a
violation
of
an
emission
standard.
my
client
is
accused
by
an
indictment
of
violating
section
112
(c)
of
the
act
for
an
alleged
failure
to
follow
the
environmental
protection
agency's
work
practice
rule.
in
the
trial
court,
we
challenged
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
a
violation
of
an
emission
standard
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
and
that
the
work
practice
rule
is
not
the
same
thing
as
an
emission
standard,
notwithstanding
its
title.
the
trail
court
agreed
and
dismissed
the
first
count
of
a
two
count
indictment
which
is
the
only
count
now
before
this
court.
the
government
appealed
and
sixth
circuit
reversed.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
our
position
amounted
to
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
regulation
itself.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
am
sorry
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
well,
one
thing
that
is
left
whether
my
client
has
to
go
trail
and
possibly
be
convicted
of
felony.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
the
issue
--
the
first
issue
as
i
understand
it
sir,
is
the
meaning
of
section
307
(b)
(2)
of
the
act
which
by
its
language
says
their
shall
be
no
judicial
review
in
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
for
enforcement
of
action
which
could
have
been
reviewed
under
the
statutory
review
procedure.
i
think
one
issue
which
is
still
open
for
decision
by
this
court
is
whether
that
statute,
that
preclusion
provision
is
in
fact
an
absolute
preclusion
of
all
judicial
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
actions
by
the
administrator,
even
actions
which
on
their
face
are
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
his
duties
under
the
act.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
think
that
is
a
question
of
fact
which
would
have
to
be
developed
at
trial
sir.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
we
were
able
to
show
at
trial
whether
we
--
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
not
by
our
motion
to
dismiss
sir.
i
think
a
--
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
no
sir,
except
for
the
fact
that
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
question
of
adequacy
and
effectiveness
of
the
statutory
remedy
which
could
invoke
the
constitutional
question
and
which
would
require
development
of
a
litigation
of
an
issue
of
fact
in
the
trial
court.
the
preclusion
section
as
i
indicated
says
there
is
to
be
no
judicial
review
in
enforcement
proceedings
of
regulations
which
could
be
reviewed
under
the
statutory
review
procedure.
the
review
procedure
is
not
now
available
to
my
client
and
could
have
been
initiated
only
by
filing
a
petition
for
review
within
30
days
of
the
date
on
which
the
regulation
was
issued.
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view
ignored
the
language
of
section
112
(c)
itself
which
prohibits
violation
of
an
emission
standard
and
which
does
not
prohibit
a
violation
of
any
regulation
which
the
administrator
might
issue,
concerning
asbestos.
from
that
perspective
we
are
not
prepared
to
concede
that
the
trial
court
was
even
reviewing
the
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
the
preclusive
provision,
as
opposed
to
simply
looking
at
the
face
of
the
regulation
to
ask
itself
whether
it
was
in
fact
the
type
of
regulation
specified
in
the
criminal
prohibition.
however,
if
that
should
be
considered
judicial
review,
we
believe
that
it
is
review
which
is
within
the
sphere
of
this
court's
decisions,
which
permit
a
limited
type
of
review
even
in
circumstances
when
review
of
agency
action
is
ordinarily
unavailable.
we
trace
that
starting
with
this
court's
decision
in
leedom
v.
kyne
in
which
this
court
indicated
that
statutory
review
provisions
normally
contemplate
review
of
agency
action
which
is
at
least
on
its
face
within
the
scope
of
agency
authority,
and
therefore,
permitted
an
inquiry
into
the
question
of
whether
the
agency
in
that
case
had
complied
with
specific
statutory
instructions.
subsequently,
in
a
case
cited
by
the
government
in
the
its
brief
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
v.
non-contract
employees
this
court
again
said
that
non
statutory
review
is
available
to
assure
that
agency
action
does
not
exceed
the
statutory
authority
and
that
action
which
is
ordinarily
not
reviewable,
is
in
fact
reviewable
to
the
extent
of
ascertaining
that
the
agency
performed
its
statutory
duty.
and
in
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
case
this
court
as
i
read
the
decision
entered
holdings
on
the
merits
on
those
limited
issues
of
whether
the
agency
action
is
within
the
scope
of
its
authority
and
whether
it
at
least
on
its
face
purported
to
comply
with
the
agency
statutory
duty.
those
holdings
were
not
jurisdictional
as
i
read
them,
they
were
holdings
on
the
merits.
last
year
in
the
thermotron
products
case
concerning
the
removal
procedure
from
federal
to
state,
from
state
to
federal
courts
rather
and
remand
procedures
back,
this
court
held
that
the
statutory
preclusion
of
review
of
a
remand
order
which
on
its
face
purported
to
be
absolute
still
permitted
judicial
review
in
the
limited
sense
of
ascertaining
whether
a
trial
court
order
of
remand
was
at
least
based
upon
one
of
the
grounds
for
remand
specified
in
the
statute.
this
past
june,
the
two
voting
act
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
i
believe
continue
to
recognize
this
principle
of
the
availability
of
limited
review.
in
briscoe
v.
bell
the
court
avoided
holding
that
coverage
determinations
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
director
of
census
were
not
open
to
judicial
inquiry,
at
least
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
reliance
by
those
officials
upon
the
criteria
specified
in
the
statute
for
making
those
determinations.
and
on
the
same
day
in
morris
versus
gressette
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
noted
that
congress
like
the
courts
operates
on
the
assumption
that
public
officials
will
perform
there
duty
and
indicates
that
line
of
inquiry,
harkens
back
to
leedom
v.
kyne
and
to
railway
clerks
which
indicates
to
me
a
line
of
authority
of
this
court
which
is
very
sound
in
my
view
and
very
persuasive
that
legislation
governing
the
scope
of
review
of
agency
action
simply
does
not
contemplate
agency
action
which
is
lawless.
that
even
where
the
review
provisions
say
review
is
unavailable,
there
can
be
at
least
an
inquiry
to
ascertain
whether
an
agency
took
action,
which
on
its
face
complied
with
what
a
statute
told
the
agency
to
do.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
well,
in
our
position
now
it
is
unavailable.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
really
from
the
--
in
the
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
there
is
really
a
difference.
i
--
between
saying
you
cannot
review
it,
unless
you
seek
review
within
30
days
of
the
time
when
its
issue
or
saying
you
cannot
review
it
at
all.
i
think
the
question
still
is,
if
congress
passes
a
law
which
says
you
must
seek
review
within
30
days
or
not
at
all,
do
they
contemplate
by
the
term
review
or
by
that
provision,
do
they
contemplate
foreclosing
the
federal
judiciary
from
any
jurisdiction
to
inquire
into
the
question
of
whether
an
administrative
agency
has
committed
an
act
which
on
its
face
is
unlawful.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
yes
sir.
i
think
that
limited
inquiry
is
always
open.
i
think
it
is
always
open
for
us
to
say
that
we
are
being
prosecuted
for
conduct
which
congress
did
not
make
a
crime.
congress
said
you
cannot
violate
an
emission
standard
and
if
we
cannot
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
regulation
is
an
emission
standard,
i
think
we
are
in
the
position
of
having
the
sixth
circuit
decision
stand,
which
holds
that
we
can
be
brought
to
trial
and
convicted
for
conduct
which
congress
did
not
make
a
crime.
i
think
we
are
in
the
position,
if
the
sixth
circuit
decision
stands,
i
think
we
are
in
a
position
of
having
a
rule
which
says
that
even
though
this
agency
was
at
the
time
in
violation
of
its
own
continuing
mandatory
duty
to
promulgate
the
kind
of
regulation
congress
told
them
to
promulgate,
an
emission
standard,
nonetheless
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
enforce
the
violation
of
law
by
the
agency
and
they
are
going
to
do
it
by
convicting
my
client
of
conduct
which
was
not
made
a
crime
by
congress.
we
think
that
is
wrong
and
i
do
not
think
it
matters
whether
our
attack
upon
the
agency's
actions
as
being
lawless
on
its
face,
comes
two
years
or
twenty
years
after
the
regulation
is
promulgated.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
the
agency
gave
it
a
title
of
emission
standard.
i
think
the
agency's
position
has
not
been
entirely
consistent
as
to
whether
it
is
or
is
not
an
emission
standard
and
i
am
not
certain
that
the
agency
has
ever
really
squarely
addressed
that
particular
question.
i
think
the
agency
has
as
i
understand
them
--
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
we
have
gone
to
the
agency
in
other
proceeding
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
not
this
one,
no
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
no
sir.
the
agency
has
always
taken
the
position
that
we
are
questioning
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
that
the
questioning
its
authority
to
issue
the
regulation
and
that
the
regulation
is
authorized.
i
do
not
think
they
have
ever
to
my
knowledge
focused
on
the
question
simply
of
whether
or
not
it
is
an
emission
standard.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
break,
i
recall
i
was
asked
whether
the
agency
had
ever
itself
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
work
practice
rule
is
an
emission
standard
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
expand
upon
my
answer
just
briefly
if
i
may.
i
think
the
agency
has
always
known
work
practice
rule
is
not
an
emission
standard.
on
december
7,
1971,
when
it
first
published
its
proposed
regulations
in
the
federal
register,
the
following
statement
appears
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
regulations
at
volume
36,
page
23239
of
the
federal
register
“because
there
is
no
suitable
technique
for
sampling
and
analyzing
asbestos
in
the
ambient
air
or
in
emission
gases,
the
standards
are
expressed
as
requirements
for
operation
of
specific
control
equipment
or
other
equipment
of
comparable
effectiveness
or
in
situations
where
no
control
system
is
available
as
prohibitions
on
the
use
of
asbestos.
when
acceptable
source
of
sampling
and
analytical
methods
are
available
and
it
is
possible
to
delineate
hazardous
levels,
these
standards
may
be
revised
to
require
compliance
with
a
measured
allowable
emission.”
on
april
6,
1973,
when
the
work
practice
regulation
was
first
promulgated
in
final
form,
in
the
preamble
to
that
publication
at
volume
38,
page
8820
of
the
federal
register,
the
agency
stated
“it
is
not
practicable
at
this
time
to
establish
allowable
numerical
concentrations
for
mass
emission
limits
for
asbestos.”
and
then
in
the
third
column
of
the
same
page
“the
means
of
control
used
are
limitations
on
visible
emissions
with
an
option
in
some
cases
to
use
designated
control
equipment,
requirements
that
certain
procedures
be
followed
and
prohibitions
on
the
use
of
certain
materials
or
certain
operations.
these
means
of
control
are
required
because
of
the
impossibility
at
this
time
of
prescribing
and
enforcing
allowable
numerical
concentrations
or
mass
emission
limitations
known
to
provide
an
ample
margin
of
safety.”
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
am
certain
that
the
final
publication
is
cited
in
the
brief.
i
am
also
certain
that
the
quotation
is
not
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
am
certain
that
the
federal
register
publication
--
this
is
the
final
regulation
as
published.
i
think
the
only
other
thing
i
need
to
say
if
the
court
please
is
that
the
the
only
inquiry
which
is
necessary
here
to
ascertain
that
the
administrator
did
not
comply
with
section
112
(b)
of
the
act
is
whether
or
not
the
regulation
on
its
face
is
an
emission
standard
and
the
result
of
that
inquiry
shows
that
my
client
is
indeed
being
prosecuted
for
something
congress
did
not
make
criminal.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
simply
wrong
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
the
portion
of
the
federal
register
at
which
the
final
regulation
is
promulgated
mr.
chief
justice,
is
cited
at
page
5
of
our
brief
and
the
regulation
itself
is
quoted,
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
a
few
brief
observations.
first
the
national
association
of
demolishing
contractors
which
suddenly
seems
to
have
backed
in
as
a
party
to
this
case
was
in
fact
first
organized
within
a
very
few
months
previous
to
the
promulgation
of
the
work
practice
regulation.
it
is
true
that
the
national
association
of
demolishing
contractors
now
undertakes
certain
legal
activities
which
might
be
described
as
done
jointly
for
its
members.
it
is
also
true
that,
that
legal
work
was
undertaken
in
response
to
the
very
problem,
which
underlies
this
very
case
which
is
that
small
businessmen
do
not
read
ten
and
twenty
thousand
pages
of
fine
print
of
the
federal
register
every
year
and
they
particularly
do
not
do
it
in
30
days
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
act
of
congress
which
says
that
they
have
to
do
so.
i
think
a
reference
was
made
to
the
notice
--
provision
of
the
--
to
the
notice
proceeding
of
the
administrator
from
the
standpoint
of
publishing
a
proposed
regulation
for
comment.
i
am
not
sure
that
my
client
adamo
wrecking
company
knew
about
the
proposed
regulation,
either.
i
am
not
sure
that
any
wrecking
company
knew
about
it.
i
am
sure
that
anybody
picking
it
up
to
read
it,
would
find
on
the
very
first
page,
23239
of
volume
36
of
the
federal
register
“the
sources
covered
in
the
asbestos
standard
are
mining,
milling,
spraying
and
manufacturing.”
i
think
it
does
--
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
law?
as
a
matter
of
law
sir,
i
believe
under
the
boyce
motor
lines
case,
we
have
to
be
shown
to
have
knowledge
of
the
facts
which
would
constitute
of
violation
of
the
law.
i
take
that
to
mean
we
have
to
know
that
the
material
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
in
fact
friable
asbestos
as
defined
in
the
regulation
and
that
we
must
also
know
that
whatever
it
is,
we
are
proved
to
have
done
would
in
fact
cause
an
emission
of
that
material.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
believe
that
this
court's
decision
in
boyce
motor
lines
in
its
progeny
make
it
very
clear
that
our
knowledge
of
the
law
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
i
think
the
word
is
just
knowingly
and
i
think
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
well
settled.
i
think
that
it
is
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
congress
did
not
tell
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency,
just
go
out
and
do
whatever
you
think
is
best
to
control
emissions
of
asbestos.
congress
for
whatever
reason,
and
as
1977
amendments
teaches,
congress
changed
its
mind
and
was
persuaded
that
it
should
have
done
something
differently
in
the
first
place.
congress
originally
told
the
administrator
to
go
out
and
promulgate
emission
standard.
i
think
even
before
the
1977
amendments,
there
is
no
way
that
this
act
can
be
read
as
a
whole
and
particularly
the
references
in
other
sections
of
the
act
to
emission
standards,
there
is
just
no
way
that
one
can
conclude
that
it
is
reasonable
to
think
that
an
emission
standard
is
now
or
ever
could
have
been
the
same
thing
as
a
work
practice
rule.
they
must
be
different
things.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
i
think
--
well
the
closest
case
i
would
have
would
be
thermotron
from
last
year
in
which
if
i
recall
correctly
the
statute
said,
decision
remanding
to
a
state
court
was
absolutely
unreviewable
and
this
court
said
that
it
was
at
least
reviewable
to
ascertain
that
the
trial
judge
had
remanded
on
a
ground
specified
as
a
basis
for
remand
in
the
statute.
i
think
if
we
can
have
that
much
inquiry
here,
we
can
look
to
see
whether
this
regulation
is
in
fact
an
emission
standard.
that
is
what
we
are
charged
with
violating,
an
emission
standard.
there
is
no
section
of
this
act
which
says
or
at
least
we
are
not
--
there
is
a
section
of
this
act,
113
if
i
recall
correctly.
which
says
that
it
is
a
crime
to
knowingly
violate
any
regulation
issued
as
part
of
a
state
implementation
plan,
under
section
110.
it
is
a
crime
to
violate
any
regulation
issued
under
section
110
as
a
part
of
the
state
implementation
plan.
the
section
we
are
charged
with
violating
does
not
say
it
is
a
crime
to
violate
any
regulation
administrator
might
issue.
it
only
says
it
is
a
crime
to
violate
an
emission
standard.
and
if
we
can
have
the
same
scope
of
review
as
was
accorded
in
the
herman
stortford
(ph)
case
last
year,
i
think
that
is
enough
to
allow
us
to
show
that
this
regulation
is
not
an
emission
standard,
if
indeed
we
are
asking
for
review
of
the
regulation.
in
our
view
we
still
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
whether
we
are
asking
for
a
ruling
by
the
trial
court
on
whether
this
indictment
alleges
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
stanley
m.
lipnick
in
our
view,
i
think
the
record
is
perfectly
adequate
to
enable
this
court
to
decide
it,
particularly
with
the
1977
amendments
which
i
think
make
abundantly
clear
that
a
work
practice
rule
just
as
not
the
same
thing
as
an
emission
standard
and
with
the
government
just
today
said
that
in
the
government's
view,
the
1977
amendments
do
not
change
the
law.
i
think
that
even
without
those
facts,
i
think
it
is
so
clear,
i
think
it
is
so
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
this
court
can
decide
the
question
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy,
but
with
the
addition
to
1977
amendments
and
with
the
government's
position
that
1977
amendments
do
not
change
anything.
i
think
that
if
this
court
should
conclude
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
see
how
there
is
any
room
for
doubt
as
to
the
result
and
i
think
that
if
i
recall
correctly,
in
the
perkins
case
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
this
court
indicated
that
where
the
record
was
adequate
to
unable
this
court
to
decide
a
question
which
had
not
been
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
would
do
so
in
the
interest
of
judicial
economy
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case.
thank
you.
