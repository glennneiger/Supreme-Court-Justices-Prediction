justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
it
is
an
absolute
preclusion,
do
you
make
any
claim
in
this
case
or
have
you
that
kind
of
preclusion
purported
conclusion
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
have
you
raised
any
constitutional
issue
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
not
pressed
any
any
constitutional
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
i
have
got
a
clear,
in
--
is
there
any
restriction
on
what,
what
issues
could
be
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
you
have
gone
with
--
to
the
administrator
with
them
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you
have
not
presented
a
particular
claim
to
the
agencies,
the
court
would
not
hear
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
about
--
what
would
you
think
about
a
coverage
question
--
well
i
will
just
say
that
the
regulation
just
simply
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute,
that
must
have
been
presented
to
the
administrator
before
the
court
will
hear
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
ever
having
been
presented
to
the
administrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
underlying
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
constitutionality
of
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
the
district
court
asked
those
questions
and
answers
them
no,
this
is
not
kind
of
a
--
he
does
not
even
purport
to
be
acting
under
the
section,
that
question
still
could
have
been
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some
questions
that
can
be
raised
later
despite
section
112?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
wrong
enough
we
will
not
review
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
wrong
enough
we
will
not
review
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
just
had
it
stand
in
district
of
columbia
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
in
the
criminal
enforcement
proceeding,
is
there
some
--
what
is
the
state
of
knowledge
by
the
defendant
supposed
to
be
for
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
is
not
required
that
you
know
anything
about
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
if,
under
this
statute
it
imposes
any
difference
standard?
