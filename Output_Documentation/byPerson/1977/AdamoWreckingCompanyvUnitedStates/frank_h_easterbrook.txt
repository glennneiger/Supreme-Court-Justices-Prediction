mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
statutory
provision
at
issue
here
is
section
307
(b)
of
the
clean
air
act
amendments.
that
section
provides
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
any
challenge
of
the
action
of
the
administrator
of
the
epa
in
promulgating
any
emission
standard
and
that
review
may
be
had
in
that
court
on
any
petition
filed
within
30
days
of
the
promulgation
or
thereafter,
if
new
grounds
arise
after
the
thirtieth
day.
section
307
(b)
(2)
provides
“action
of
the
administrator
with
respect
to
which
review
could
have
been
obtained”
under
the
first
paragraph
shall
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review
in
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
for
enforcement.
that
statute
is
abundantly
clear.
the
challenge
petitioner
now
raises
to
the
validity
of
the
emission
standard
promulgated
by
the
administrator
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
none
your
honor.
the
district
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
the
district
district
of
columbia
circuit
requires
that
the
claims
have
been
raised,
statutory
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
are
sometimes
problems
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
your
honor,
that
would
go
with
claims
of
this
sort.
if
it
were
a
claim
being
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
that
the
administrator
had
never
had
the
chance
to
consider,
it
might
be
appropriate
not
to
consider
it
or
it
might
be
appropriate
under
district
of
columbia
circuit
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no
your
honor,
i
think
the
pure
coverage
case
could
be
raised
at
any
time
in
the
dc,
not
at
any
time,
but
it
could
be
raised
in
the
dc
circuit.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
the
result
of
that
would
be
the
same
since
the
administrator
lacks
the
authority
to
declare
the
underlying
statute
on
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
would
depend
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
challenge
to
the
regulation.
if
the
nature
of
the
challenge
was
such
that
a
regulation
easily
could
have
been
drafted
consistent
with
the
protestant's
view
of
constitutionality
that,
that
kind
of
claim
should
be
presented
first
to
the
administrator
so
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
draft
a
regulation
that
in
the
view
of
whether
it
challenges
its
constitutional.
if
they
were
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
case
that
rational
would
not
apply
because
the
administrator
has
already
considered
whether
it
is
practicalable
to
promulgate
a
regulation
in
some
other
form
and
we
have
the
administrator's
judgment
on
that.
there
would
be
no
point
in
asking
for
his
judgment
again.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
30
day
time
limit
commences
to
run
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
only
after
the
final
promulgation
of
the
regulation.
these
regulations
are
promulgated
after
notice
and
comment
rule
making.
in
this
case
the
initial
notice
promulgate
and
publication
came
in
1971
and
there
was
a
process
of
more
than
a
year
before
the
final
promulgation.
the
30
days
commenced
to
run
only
after
the
final
promulgation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
he
not
only
did
not
challenge
it
before
the
agency,
but
no
one
challenged
it
before
the
agency
on
those
grounds,
then
consistent
with
the
rationale
that
i
gave
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
i
think
he
would
then
be
barred
in
the
dc
circuit.
the
statute
itself
as
i
have
said
is
quite
clear
and
the
contention
that
petitioner
now
raises
is
one
that
he
could
have
raised
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
under
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
white.
indeed
petitioner
conceded
in
the
district
court
a
concession
that
appears
at
page
85
of
the
court
of
appeals'
appendix
that
he
could
have
raised
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
the
contentions
he
now
raises,
because
the
challenge
could
have
been
raised
in
that
court.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
not
your
honor
and
i
can
answer
that
in
several
respects.
section
(b)
(2)
says
that
review
is
barred
on
any
question
that
could
have
been
reviewed
under
(b)
(1).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
so
for
in
order,
in
order
for
petitioner
to
prevail
here,
you
would
have
to
first
conclude
that
his
contentions
are
ones
that
that
district
of
columbia's
circuit
could
not
have
considered
on
a
petition
being
filed
under
(b)
(1).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
held
in
the
ohato
case
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
at
page
15
of
our
brief
that
it
may
consider
challenges
similar
to
the
challenge
that
issues
here,
that
is
a
contention
that
the
regulation
was
on
its
face
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
the
statute
authorized.
under
that
rationale
this
was
a
challenge,
review
of
which
could
have
been
had
in
the
dc
circuit,
and
of
which
review
therefore
may
not
had
now
under
(b)
(2),
i
can
set
out
a
couple
of
reasons
for
that.
the
argument
that
you
cannot,
that
you
can
now
review
in
criminal
proceeding
the
contention
that
there
is
no
emission
standard,
would
essentially
make
the
question
of
jurisdiction
turn
on
the
merits,
that
is
under
petitioner's
view,
review
would
be
precluded
only
after
the
district
court
had
already
given
the
regulation
for
review.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
think
that
we
need
to
make
an
argument
that
extreme
in
order
to
prevail
here.
let
me
suggest
the
two
kinds
of
inquiries
that
i
think
the
district
court
should
ask.
the
first
kind
of
inquiry
is
whether
the
administrator's
regulation
purports
to
rely
on
section
112,
that
is
whether
he
says
that
this
is
an
emission
standard.
second
kind
of
question
the
district
court
might
ask
and
properly
so,
is
whether
the
administrator's
regulation
purports
to
control
the
emission
of
the
hazardous
substance,
since
section
112
is
a
section
dealing
with
release
of
hazardous
substances
into
the
air.
the
district
court
if
it
answers
those
questions
affirmatively,
that
is
if
it
says
the
administrator
says
he
is
relied
section
112
and
this
regulation
in
fact
controls
the
emission
of
hazardous
substances
into
the
air
should
conclude
its
inquiry
at
that
point.
there
are
of
course,
a
myriad
of
ways
in
which
the
administrator
might
go
about
controlling
those
kinds
of
emissions.
the
question
whether
he
has
controlled
emissions
in
the
very
way
that
the
statute
contemplated
is
we
think
exactly
the
kind
of
question
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
required
review
of
that
thing
to
come
into
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
when
i
answered
mr.
rehnquist
by
saying
that
we
did
not
have
to
go
as
far
as
his
hypothetical,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
it.
ultimately
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think,
no
the
question
--
the
suggestion
that
i
made
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
i
think
the
same
kind
of
question
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
would
ask
itself
when
someone
filed
a
petition
for
review
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
is
to
say
before
that
court
could
exercise
its
statutory
review
authority,
it
would
have
to
decide
whether
the
claim
that
was
being
made
before
it
was
a
challenge
to
something
under
section
112,
pardon.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
pardon?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
if
it
is
wrong
enough,
but
if
it
is
not
--
not
even
purported
to
be
promulgated
under
this
section.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
answer
i
think
would
be
that
this
could
something
for
an
original
action
in
the
district
court.
in
similar
problems
before
this
court
last
year
in
the
depart
three
depart
cases
(ph)
involving
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
would
have
review
of
certain
regulations
promulgated
by
the
administrator.
before
you
could
decide
that
question
you
had
to
decide
what
kind
of
regulations
they
were.
i
think
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
must
ask
the
same
kind
of
question
when
someone
files
a
petition
for
review
with
it.
it
says
this
is
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
administrator.
is
it
the
kind
of
thing
described
in
section
307
(b)
(1)?
if
so
it
would
review
it
there.
if
not
it
must
dismiss
the
petition
for
review
and
the
two
criteria
that
i
gave
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
are
i
believe
the
criteria
that
that
court
should
ask.
i
think
if
you
ask
those
questions
here,
the
regulation
satisfies
those
criteria,
and
therefore,
it
was
one
that
could
have
been
reviewed
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
let
me
go
back
if
i
can,
briefly
to
discuss
the
legislative
history
of
section
307
(b)
because
i
believe
that
sheds
considerable
light
on
the
kinds
of
things
that
must
be
reviewed
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
section
307
(b)
originated
in
the
senate
which
adopted
the
limitation
on
judicial
review
as
an
alternative
according
to
the
senate
report
at
page
41
to
an
absolute
preclusion.
the
reason
why
it
was
considering
something
as
extreme
as
absolute
preclusion
of
judicial
review
was
that
it
wanted
“to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
time
sequences
provided
throughout
the
act.”
each
of
the
steps
in
promulgation
of
regulations
and
review
of
regulations
is
a
precondition
to
something
else.
in
this
case
a
precondition
to
compliance,
but
one
of
the
necessities
of
compliance
is
to
have
a
valid
regulation.
and
so
congress
centralized
review
in
a
single
forum,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
with
a
very
short
time
limitation
for
review
in
order
to
achieve
two
important
objectives.
the
first
of
those
objectives
was
to
make
sure
that
any
review
would
produce
uniform
results
across
the
nation.
all
competitors
in
the
industry
would
be
subjected
to
the
same
standards
rather
than
different
standards
that
might
be
imposed
by
different
judges.
and
second
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
if
in
fact
the
regulation
was
invalid,
the
invalidity
would
be
detected
quickly,
so
that
the
administrator
could
then
promulgate
a
new
ands
valid
regulation.
that
required
a
time
limitation
on
judicial
review.
congress
set
out
to
give
the
regulations
after
the
period
for
review
had
expired
the
same
unquestioned
authority
as
the
statute
itself.
section
307
accomplish
that
end,
and
the
position
of
petitioner
which
amounts
to
saying
that
the
regulations
are
always
open
to
challenge
would
frustrate
that
end.
we
understand
petitioner
to
make
three
kinds
of
arguments.
first
petitioner
argues
that
any
regulation
maybe
attacked
on
its
face
at
anytime.
second,
and
this
a
variation
of
the
first
argument
that
i
have
already
discussed
in
part,
petitioner
contents
that
section
307
(b)
applies
only
to
regulations
that
are
in
fact
end
in
law,
emission
standards.
the
third
contention
which
petitioner
makes
only
implicitly,
but
which
the
district
court
made
more
clearly
is
that
section
307
applies
only
to
attacks
on
the
procedure
by
which
the
regulations
promulgated
and
not
the
contentions
that
the
substance
of
the
regulation
is
unauthorized
by
statute.
none
of
these
arguments
are
correct.
i
will
take
them
up
in
turn.
the
first
argument
that
regulations
maybe
attacked
on
their
face
at
anytime
is
inconsistent
with
the
progeny
of
the
yakus
case.
in
the
wake
of
yakus
which
upheld
against
constitutional
attack,
a
statute
very
similar
to
section
307
(b),
this
court
applied
that
rule
of
preclusion
in
a
number
of
cases
attacking
regulations
as
inconsistent
on
their
face
with
the
statute
authorizing
the
promulgation
of
price
regulations.
these
cases
are
collected
at
page
24
of
our
brief.
if
there
are
any
reason
to
distinguish
between
a
tax
on
the
face
of
the
regulation
and
the
tax
on
the
regulations
applied
and
section
307
makes
no
such
distinction,
it
will
be
more
appropriate
to
bar
facial
attacks.
after
all
facial
defects
are
known
the
instant
a
regulation
is
promulgated,
whereas
attacks
on
the
regulation
as
applied
in
particular
cases
may
not
come
to
rise
until
later,
and
therefore,
it
maybe
difficult
to
protest
within
30
days,
things
that
are
unknown
at
the
promulgation.
petitioner
contents,
however,
that
leedom
against
kyne
supports
the
position
that
a
person
always
may
challenge
a
regulation
as
facially
inconsistent
with
the
authorizing
statute.
but
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
later
cases,
most
recently
last
june
in
briscoe
against
bell,
footnote
13,
that
leedom
did
not
establish
that
principle.
leedom
was
a
case
in
which
judicial
review
was
conditioned
on
a
final
order
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it
was
necessary
to
construe
that
ambiguous
term
in
order
to
determine
when
review
was
appropriate.
if
in
leedom
that
term
had
not
been
construed
to
make
review
available,
it
might
never
have
been
available,
but
those
problems
do
not
arise
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
of
a
bargaining
unit.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
be
available
only
if
the
employer
then
refuse
to
bargain.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
it
is,
but
in
leedom
the
question
was
inclusion
of
particular
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
and
the
employer
and
the
employee,
the
employer
and
the
union
were
then
going
to
bargain,
there
never
would
have
been
any
ada-5
violation
in
leedom.
the
ada-5
violation
can
come
about
only
if
the
employer
refuses
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right,
but
that
was
not
happen
in
leedom?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
the,
my
point
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
review
in
leedom
because
the
employer
had
already
said
that
he
was
willing
to
bargain
so
it
was
case
in
which
there
could
be
no
effective
review
at
all.
that
was
the
need
to
resolve
the
ambiguity.
later
cases
such
as
brotherhood
of
railway
trainmen
have
construed
leedom
rather
narrowly
and
in
any
event
leedom
did
not
involve
or
review
preclusion
statute
like
section
307
nor
did
it
involve
what
307
involves.
it
is
not
a
complete
preclusion
of
review.
this
is
statute
requiring
contentions
to
be
made
in
a
particular
court
at
a
particular
time.
it
does
not
bar
adamo
from
challenging
the
regulation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
think
that
is
so
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
means
that
small
contractors
have
to
address
these
kinds
of
problems.
one
is
to
form
a
trade
association
which
the
national
association
of
demolition
contractors
is,
which
acts
effectively
as
the
agent
of
all
of
of
the
small
demolition
contractors
for
reading
the
federal
register
and
advising
them
of
their
interests
and
in
some
cases
including
a
subsequent
challenge
to
the
regulation
at
issue
here,
the
national
association
of
demolition
contractors
has
filed
a
petition
for
judicial
review
acting
to
protect
the
interests
of
its
members.
that
kind
of
collective
action
is
always
available
to
small
contractors,
but
the
second
answer
is
that,
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
congress
to
require
small
contractors
to
read
the
federal
register.
when
contractors
are
dealing
as
they
are
here
with
a
material
like
asbestos
which
is
one
of
the
most
potent
cancer
causing
agents
known,
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
which
tells
those
who
may
cause
the
deaths
of
innocent
people
to
read
the
federal
register
to
protect
their
interests.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
did
not
want
to
imply
that
all
of
them
would
read
the
federal
register
and
i
retract
that
kind
of
suggestion.
second
argument
which
we
have
discussed
briefly
already
is
that
section
307
applies
only
to
emission
standards,
and
therefore,
you
have
to
decide
first
whether
something
is
in
emission
standard
in
order
to
know
whether
review
is
precluded
in
the
district
court.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
as
i
said
to
you
earlier
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
that
makes
jurisdiction
turn
on
the
merits
and
it
makes
it
turn
on
the
merits
in
a
way
that
would
make
section
307
(b)
completely
ineffective.
one
of
the
things
that
can
be
done
to
challenge
regulations
of
this
sort
is
to
contend
that
they
are
not
only
not
emission
standards,
but
they
are
not
emission
standards
because
they
are
arbitrary
capricious
and
abusive
discretion
of
the
like.
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
authorize
the
administrator
of
the
epa
to
be
arbitrary
or
to
be
capricious
or
to
abuse
his
discretion
or
to
do
something
that
on
its
face
is
unreasonable.
all
of
those
things
are
the
reasons
why
the
administrator
has
acted
unlawfully,
and
therefore,
has
not
promulgated
the
kind
of
emission
standard
that
the
statute
contemplated.
but
if
those
kinds
of
contentions
are
open,
then
section
307
(b)
means
nothing
because
those
are
surely
at
the
core
of
what
congress
intended
to
preclude.
as
i
think
our
contention
is
that
rather
than
regulating
emissions
of
asbestos
in
one
way
by
requiring
it
to
be
vetted,
it
should
have
regulated
emissions
of
asbestos
in
some
other
way
that
is
by
setting
numerical
standards.
all
of
those
attacks
on
how
the
administrator
ought
to
go
about
the
business
of
regulating
asbestos
emission
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
congress
intended
to
be
reviewed
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
and
that
therefore,
cannot
be
reviewed
now.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
part,
in
part
i
think
we
may
have
became
engaged
in
the
semantic
exercise.
my
point
and
perhaps
an
excessively
semantic
one
was
that
it
is
always
possible
to
say
that
because
the
regulation
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
it
was
not
the
kind
of
emission
standard
that
congress
contemplated
at
all.
ultimately
what
petitioner
is
arguing
is
that
what
the
administrator
did
is
not
the
kind
of
emission
standard
the
congress
contemplated.
petitioner
agrees
i
believe
that
congress
intended
the
administrator
to
regulate
asbestos
and
to
control
the
amount
of
asbestos
that
can
come
of
into
the
air.
what
this
dispute
is
about
is
how
best
the
administrator
should
do
that
and
whether
congress
authorized
him
to
do
it
in
a
particular
way
and
although
you
can,
it
is
true
always
plays
that
as
a
question
as
to
whether
there
is
any
emission
standard
at
all.
it
is
equally
reasonable
to
phrase
it
as
the
question
whether
the
emission
standard
that
the
administrator
promulgated
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
those
kinds
of
arguments
would
go
mr
chief
justice
to
whether
the
procedures
for
review
established
an
adequate
forum
in
which
it
could
be
reviewed.
we
understand
petitioner's
answer
to
mr
justice
white,
he
is
not
contending
that
the
opportunity
for
review
was
in
fact
inadequate.
petitioner
has
said
that
he
is
going
to
reserve
these
for
disposition
of
the
trial.
we
believe
that
they
cannot
be
so
reserved
under
rule
12
(b)
of
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
but
in
any
event
petitioner
is
not
making
any
argument
that
the
opportunity
for
review
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
was
inadequate
and
i
think
the
ten
day
review
would
pose
more
difficult
questions,
but
i
think
i
ought
to
point
out
that
congress
had
been
sensitive
to
these
kinds
of
concerns.
the
most
recent
legislation
which
the
president
signed
in
august
and
which
we
refer
to
in
the
first
footnote
of
our
supplemental
brief
extends
from
30
to
60
days,
the
time
within
which
to
challenge
in
the
provision
of
district
of
columbia
circuit.
so
congress
has
been
very
careful
not
to
cut
off
necessary
opportunities
to
receive
and
study
the
regulation
before
deciding
whether
to
object.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
such
statutes
which
are
collected
in
one
of
the
footnotes
to
our
brief.
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
statutes
contain
30
day
limitations
and
in
both
of
those
cases
violation
of
the
rules
can
be
criminal,
can
lead
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
there
is
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
10
days
would
sometimes
get
exceedingly
close
and
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
mail
delay
or
perhaps
negligence
in
delivering
the
mail
is
subject
to
merely
a
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no
your
honor
it
would
not.
it
would
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
if
that
complaint
should
be
raised
within
30
days
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
one
again
national
applicability
and
one
that
ought
to
be
resolved
very
quickly
is
whether
this
is
or
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
the
congress
forbade.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
so
your
honor.
that
should
be
resolved
in
the
dc
circuit.
the
final
ground
for
challenging,
for
arguing
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
was
one
raised
by
the
district
court
itself
which
is
that
section
307
(b)
(1)
refers
only
to
the
action
of
the
administrator
“in
promulgating”
in
emission
standard.
the
district
court
thought
that
this
meant
that
it
referred
only
to
procedural
flaws
and
not
to
substantive
flaws.
the
answer
to
that
of
course
is
that
if
307
(b)
(1)
is
interpreted
in
that
way
the
evident
desire
of
congress
is
again
defeated
because
it
is
impossible
to
have
unified
and
prompt
review
of
the
substitute
rules.
indeed
if
the
district
court
were
correct,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
would
have
absolutely
no
authority
to
review
the
substantive
portions
of
the
objection,
but
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
held
that
it
does
have
such
authority
and
we
think
rightly
so.
petitioner's
alternate
argument
is
simply
that
it
is
unfair
to
foreclose
its
attack
on
the
regulations.
we
do
not
see
the
unfairness
of
which
petitioner
protests.
public
regulatory
offenses
of
which
this
is
one
are
often
strict
liability
offenses,
that
is
criminal
sanctions
can
be
imposed
without
any
form
of
mens
rea.
the
statute
at
issue
here
does
not
make
violation
of
the
regulation
a
strict
liability
offense.
emission
in
violation
of
a
regulation
is
criminal
only
if
done
knowingly,
but
what
it
does
require
is
that
persons
read
the
federal
register
at
the
their
peril
or
obtain
someone
else
to
do
that
for
them.
it
is
a
standard
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
find
out
what
is
going
on
in
washington
that
might
effect
their
interests
and
take
care
of
them.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
large
undertaking
and
that
i
think
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
formation
of
the
national
association
of
demolition
contractors.
[laughter]
but
my
point
is
that
it
is
not
unfair
for
congress
to
require
members
of
the
industry
to
undertake
that
kind
of
project
to
understand
and
protect
their
own
interest
within
a
period
of
time.
petitioner
or
someone
acting
on
its
behalf
have
30-days
within
which
to
file
a
petition
for
review
and
the
statute
does
provide
that
if
any
reasons
arise
later
that
would
be
good
grounds
for
review,
they
may
be
raised
later.
statute
is
simply
a
plan
that
allocates
judicial
review
to
a
particular
court
at
a
particular
time
and
we
believe
it
should
be
respected.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
in
answer
to
mr
justice
brennan's
first
question
to
mr.
lipnick.
the
case
is
still
alive
on
mr.
justice
brennan,
even
though
the
statute
has
been
amended
because
the
acts
at
issue
here
took
place
before
the
amendment.
this
is
of
criminal
enforcement
proceeding
and
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
prohibit
the
application
of
1977
amendments
to
this
case.
assuming
that
the
1977
amendments
changed
the
law,
it
is
our
position
that
they
did
not
change
the
law
and
the
legislative
history
of
those
amendments
indicate
that
the
congress
was
simply
clarifying
authority
the
administrator
already
possessed,
but
if
in
fact
the
petitioner
is
right
that
the
1977
statute
--
that
the
1970
statute
did
not
authorize
this
regulation,
this
kind
of
prosecution
would
not
assisted
by
the
1977
amendments.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
does
mr
justice
stewart,
we
just
like
on
footnote
2,
two
pages
over
there.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
by
referring
to
the
legislative
history,
we
think
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
reason
congress
addressed
them
as
two
different
animals
in
the
statute
was
to
restrict
the
administrator's
authority
to
use
work
practices
instead
of
numerical
limitations.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
not
,but
i
think
what
congress
had
in
mind
by
giving
them
different
names
was
to
restrict,
was
to
prefer
one
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
you
want
to
achieve,
if
you
want
to
say
that
the
administrator
must
prefer
numerical
limits
to
work
practice
limitations
then
i
think
you
have
call
them
by
different
names,
but
the
requirement
that
the
administrator
prefer
one
to
the
other
is
a
new
requirement
that
we
think
was
not
present
in
the
1970
statute.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
did
not
amend
that
in
307
(b).
it
still
referred
307
(b)
(1),
still
refers
to
emission
standards
promulgated
by
section
112.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
are
treated
as
emission
standards
promulgated
under
section
112
and
reviewed
under
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
under
section307
(b)
(1).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
statute
is
not
model
of
legislative
draftsmen
ship
mr
justice
rehnquist.
