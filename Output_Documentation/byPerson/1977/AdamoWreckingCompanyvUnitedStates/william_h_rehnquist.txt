justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
this
statute
did
not
say
review
was
unavailable,
it
said
it
just
had
to
be
taken
within
the
certain
time,
did
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
you
can
say
that
about
the
statute
of
limitations
or
latches
too
if
you
let
the
thing
go
long
enough,
it
is
unavailable,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
of
limitation
is
ignored?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
attack
of
the
administrative
action
come
two
or
three
years
after
the
promulgation
of
the
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
agency
think
this
was
an
emission
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
work
that
all
in
a
30
day
time
limit,
all
the
administrative
exhaustion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well
supposing
that
person
in
question
gets
a
copy
of
the
notice
or
advice,
but
does
not
do
anything
then,
and
the
regulation
becomes
final
and
then
he
seeks
to
challenge
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
within
30
days,
is
he
debarred
because
he
did
not
challenge
it
before
the
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
under
your
view,
if
the
administrator
promulgates
something
called
an
emission
standard
and
the
text
of
it
is
that
every
wrecker
shall
pay
$500
a
month
into
a
conservation
fund,
he
is
bound
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
no
matter
how
far
away
from
the
legislative
intent
that
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there
is
any
practically,
you
mentioned
the
word
practical
a
couple
sentences
ago
and
if
you
take
a
record
out
in
2000
miles
away
from
washington,
that
does
not
read
the
federal
register
and
so
far
has
a
very
small
business.
this
kind
of
a
statute
really
practically
bars
him
from
challenging
it,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know
i
may
agree
with
that
and
perhaps
all
the
court
may
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
you
should
delete
the
word
practical
then
from
your
argument
because
as
a
practical
matter
many,
many
small
businessmen
would
be
precluded
from
reviewing
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
now
review
work
product,
work
practice
standards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
what
authority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
the
most
circular
thing
i
ever
heard
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
had
passed
a
law
that
simply
said
anything
labeled
an
emission
standard
by
the
administrator
and
not
challenged
within
30
days
of
its
promulgation,
shall
be
deemed
written
into
the
statute
itself.
would
you
have
any
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
the
united
states
criminally
prosecuted
the
petitioner,
adamo
wrecking
co.
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
for
failure
to
comply
with
an
emission
standard
which
had
been
issued
by
the
administrator
under
the
clean
air
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment,
concluding
that
the
regulation
was
not
an
emission
standard
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
as
used
by
congress
in
the
act.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
that
court
reversed,
holding
that
another
provision
of
the
act
barred
the
petitioner
from
raising
this
issue
because
the
validity
of
the
regulation
had
not
been
earlier
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
within
30
days
of
its
promulgation.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
this
extremely
complex
act,
congress
has
provided
significantly
different
review
mechanisms
for
different
types
of
regulations.
because
of
these
different
consequences,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
the
agency's
mere
designation
of
a
regulation
as
an
emission
standard
to
be
conclusive
as
to
its
character
is
to
that
affect.
it
follows
that
district
court
must
determine
whether
a
regulation
is
on
its
face
an
emission
standard
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
thus
appropriately
subject
to
the
preclusive
review
provisions
of
section
307.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
the
government
is
required
to
prove
that
the
regulation
allegedly
violated
by
petitioner
was
indeed
an
emission
standard.
the
district
court
in
our
opinion
properly
concluded
that
this
regulation,
dictating
particular
work
practices
to
be
followed
in
the
demolition
of
buildings
was
not
such
a
standard.
the
language
and
history
of
the
act
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
emission
standards
to
be
quantitative
limitations
on
emissions
of
particular
pollutants.
the
district
court's
judgment
of
dismissing
the
indictment
was
therefore
proper
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
separate
concurrence.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he's
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
