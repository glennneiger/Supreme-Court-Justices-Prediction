may
i
ask
what
is
left

case
after

amendments?

what
is
left
in
--
your
issue
after
these
amendments
this
summer?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
issue
is
in
the
meaning
of
that
statue,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
any
other
favorable
statute
to
have
a
30
day
limitation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
statute
in
addition
to
authorizing
the
administrator
to
promulgate
emission
standards
contained
an
exception,
the
exceptions
of
which
read
quite
explicitly
that
the
administrator
would
have
no
authority
to
promulgate
work
rule
and
let
us
assume
further
that
the
administrator
went
ahead
and
promulgated
what
fairly
could
be
characterized
as
a
work
rule.
assume
further
there
have
been
no
appeal
within
a
30
day
period,
will
that
present
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
administrator
has
violated
the
act
of
congress?
