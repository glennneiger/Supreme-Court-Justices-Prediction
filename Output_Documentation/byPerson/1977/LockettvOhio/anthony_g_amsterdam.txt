mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
of
sandra
lockett
v.
ohio,
raises
many
of
the
same
issues
relating
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ohio
death
penalty
statutes
that
were
involved
in
the
bell
case
just
argued.
however,
in
the
lockett
case
there
are
also
serious
federal
constitutional
questions
in
regard
to
the
procedures
through
which
ms
lockett’s
conviction
of
the
crime
of
aggravated
murder
was
obtained,
and
because
the
court
will
not
and
need
not
reach
the
question
of
penalty,
unless
it
affirms
her
conviction
on
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
devote
some
portion
of
my
argument
time
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
federal
constitutional
was
violated
in
this
lockett’s
conviction.
by
improper
prosecutory
or
comment
on
our
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
in
her
defense.
in
addressing
this
issue,
let
me
if
i
may
it
please
the
court,
just
describe
very
briefly
the
background
of
this
trial
and
the
respective
theories
of
the
parties
at
the
trial.
ms
lockett
stands
convicted
and
condemned
of
the
crime
of
aggravated
murder
for
a
killing
of
sidney
cohen,
a
pawnshop
proprietor
in
the
course
of
a
pawnshop
robbery.
at
the
time
that
mr.
cohen
was
killed,
the
gun
was
in
the
hands
of
al
parker,
the
chief
say
prosecution
witness
in
this
case.
the
prosecutions
theory
is
that,
parker,
petitioner’s
brother
james
lockett,
one
at
nathan
dew
and
the
petitioner,
had
conspired
and
planned
together
to
rob
sid's
market
loan
company
that
they
had
all
gone
there
for
that
purpose,
the
petitioner
had
remained
outside
in
the
car,
that
the
three
man
had
gone
in,
committed
the
robbery
in
the
course
of
which
according
to
parker’s
own
testimony,
mr.
cohen
snatched
at
the
gun
and
it
went
off
accidentally
and
although
the
killing
was
totally
outside
the
plan
of
the
robbery,
he
was
killed.
now,
important
thing
to
recognize
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
refer
your
honor
simply
to
mr.
parker’s
own
testimony.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
62,
the
question
was
asked
now,
al,
the
purpose
to
go
to
the
pawnshop
was
to
do
what?
what
was
the
plan
when
you
went
to
the
pawnshop
to
do
what?
answer
to
rob.
it
had
not
been
discussed
the
killing,
no
sir,
okay
that
was
not
part
of
the
plan?
no
sir.
that
is
what
i
mean
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
was
a
plan
to,
they
did
not
enter
the
pawnshop
with
gun
even
if
with
bullets
and
they
certainly
did
arm
a
gun
which
was
in
there.
there
is
no
doubt
to
the
plan
included
using
a
loaded
weapon,
but
the
plan
did
not
include
killing
and
it
is
not
one
of
these
execution
style,
kill
a
witness
type
of
things
according
to
the
prosecutor’s
own
testimony.
for
purposes
of
the
self-incrimination
issue
however,
what
is
important
is
this,
that
the
prosecution
theory
as
against
petitioner,
is
entirely
if
she
was
a
party
to
this
conspiracy
to
go
in
and
rob.
the
defense
theory
was
not
that
the
petitioner
did
not
know
her
brother
and
dew
and
parker
whether
she
was
somewhere
else.
the
defense
admitted
that
she
went
with
him
to
the
pawnshop
and
sat
outside,
but
the
defendant’s
contention
was
that
there
was
no
plan
to
rob
at
all
and
that
she
thought
they
were
going
into
pawn
a
ring.
no,
all
of
the
evidence
which
connects
the
petitioner
with
a
specific
plan
to
rob
the
pawnshop
is
parker’s
testimony,
if
this
court
will
examine
the
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
will
find
that
it
is
whole
recitation
of
the
facts
of
the
case
consists
of
recitation
of
parker’s
testimony,
with
a
statement
that
it
was
corroborated
by
the
testimony
of
several
other
minor
witnesses.
what
is
significant
however
is
that
the
testimony
of
those
witnesses
while
corroborating
parts
of
parker’s
and
well
consistent
with
a
theory
of
petitioner’s
guilt,
was
also
a
perfectly
consistent
with
a
theory
of
petitioner’s
innocence
including
the
very
theory
of
petitioner’s
innocence
as
spoused
by
the
petitioner
at
trial,
namely
that
she
was
just
along
for
the
rob.
now,
against
this
background,
the
following
things
happened
in
the
trial
-
petitioner
did
not
testify,
that
was
not
a
happy
incident
which
a
lawyer
indicated
she
would
take
the
stand,
but
she
declined
and
did
not,
she
called
the
only
two
members
of
the
conspiracy,
dew
and
her
brother,
whom
the
prosecution
did
not
present
because
parker
was
the
chief
prosecution
witness
and
they
both
took
the
faith
in
front
of
the
juror,
leaving
all
of
the,
conspirator's
out
of
a
count
as
possible
witnesses
and
then
in
the
course
of
closing
argument
in
the
case,
the
prosecutor
made
the
argument
of
which
we
complain.
in
a
theme
that
recurs
constantly
throughout
the
argument
and
staccato
repetition
underlining
for
emphasis
about
theme,
the
prosecutor
repeated
again
and
again,
seven
times
in
all,
that
the
prosecution’s
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
unrefuted
and
the
prosecutor
closed
uncontradicted
and
unrefuted
evidence,
nothing
from
the
defense,
no
evidence
from
the
defense.
now,
our
submission
is
simply
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
that
would
be
taken
by
the
jury
to
direct
their
attention
to
the
defendants’
failure
to
take
a
stand
in
her
own
behalf
and
is
therefore
a
forbidden
comment
under
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
vitiates
her
conviction
under
griffin
v.
california.
to
argue
this
point,
i
think
i
need
only
make
a
factual
analysis,
if
i
may
of
parker’s
testimony
because
i
think
that
if
one
understands
what
parker’s
testimony
was
about
and
how
this
case
appeared
to
the
jury,
the
fifth
amendment
issue
can
only
be
resolved
one
way.
if
you
look
at
parker’s
testimony,
you
will
find
that
there
are
a
total
of
15
episodes
which
in
anyway
could
conceivably
connect
petitioner
to
the
plot
to
rob
the
store,
and
by
15
episodes
i
do
not
want
if
it
gives
the
mis-impression,
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence.
first
of
all,
all
this
is
parker’s
testimony.
secondly,
many
of
these
episodes
are
very
minor
details
quite
consistent
with
innocence
or
guilt,
they
are
just
part
of
the
story.
but
when
i
say
episodes,
i
mean
scenes,
if
you
conceive
of
it
as
though
we
were
projecting
a
movie
or
making
a
movie
of
these
events.
there
would
be
16
scenes
and
that
is
important
because
the
question
is
who
is
available
to
testify
each
of
these
scenes.
our
submission
is
that
the
only
relevant
scenes,
the
only
witnesses
are
parke,
the
defendant,
the
other
co-defendants
and
therefore
when
the
prosecutor
says
our
evidence
is
uncontradicted,
the
jury
says
who
could
contradict
it?
answer
is
only
the
defendant.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
mean
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
you
say
on
one
occasion
that
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
would
be
a
very
different
thing
and
if
you
say
it
seven
times
uncontradicted
and
unrefuted.
it
also
makes
a
difference
whether
petitioner
is
the
only
person
who
can
contradict
or
refute
evidence.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
prosecutor
can
never
say
evidence
is
uncontradicted.
what
we
are
arguing
is
the
prosecutor’s
description
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
not
say
that
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
prosecutor
may
not
amass
such
a
repeated
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
one
thing
to
affirmatively
argue
the
credibility
of
prosecution
witness.
it
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
if
the
prosecutor
does
make
an
argument
which
invites
the
jury
to
say
to
itself.
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand,
if
she
had
taken
the
stand
then
if
she
had
been
innocent,
she
would
have
taken
the
stand
but
she
did
not
take
the
stand
so
she
must
be
guilty.
then
it
seems
to
me
is
what
the
privilege
is
all
about.
now,
the
prosecutor’s
argument
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
certainly
a
risk
which
is
involved
in
the
system,
but
it
is
the
square
of
holding
in
griffin
v.
california
that
that
risk
cannot
be
increased
in
anyway
by
comment
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
parties
in
the
proceeding.
the
prosecutor
cannot
invite
the
jury
to
draw
that
conclusion
even
though
the
jury
might
do
it
itself,
not
from
the
court
and
the
prosecutor’s
argument
which
hammers
on
to
the
jury
again
and
again
so
that
the
jury
must
necessarily
be
thinking
to
itself
about
what
we
are
being
asked
to
convict
on
is
a
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
and
answer
the
evidence
of
the
prosecution.
there
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
comment
on
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
in
the
context
of
this
case.
i
cannot
mean
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
only
testimony
the
defendant
could
have
presented
was
the
defendant’s
own
testimony.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
agree
that
the
prosecutor
can
say,
can
direct
the
jury’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
other
available
witnesses
when
the
defendant
did
go,
but
the
very
purpose
of
my
analysis
of
parker’s
testimony
was
to
show
that
in
fact
there
were
no
other
witnesses
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
it
may
make
sense
for
me
to
pass
to
the
death
penalty
questions
at
this
point.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
there
was.
there
was
a
one
paragraph
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
well,
then
if
may
i
move
to
the
death
penalty,
if
you
suggest?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
only
thing
i
wanted
to
point
out
justice
stewart
because
it
was
not
dealt
with
in
our
brief
since
it
was
raised
on
the
respondent'
brief,
was
a
notion
that
there
are
other
witnesses
who
could
have
testified.
going
to
justice
marshall’s
question,
the
answer
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
are
no
other
witnesses
who
could
testify.
any
relevant
events
that
split
the
difference
between
the
prosecution
and
defense
theory.
i
may
move
them
to
death
penalty
questions.
i
simply
want
to
speak
to
two
of
the
several
constitutional
attacks
on
ohio’s
death
penalty
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
their
relationship.
one
is
the
one
of
which
the
court
heard
argument
this
morning
that
the
ohio
death
penalty
statute
is
too
narrow,
too
much
circumscribes,
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances
to
meet
the
command
of
the
woodson
and
roberts
cases
that
individualized
consideration
be
given
to
circumstances
of
defense
and
offender.
the
second
argument
which
is
raised
in
both
bell
and
lockett,
is
the
argument
that
the
application
of
the
death
penalty
to
a
person
who
was
neither
a
participant
in
the
killing
nor
an
intentional
perpetrator
of
any
act
that
was
directed
to
a
killing,
for
instance,
proportionality
principle
in
coker
and
earlier
cases
because
justice
marshall
has
alleged,
sandra
lockett
may
be
a
felon,
but
not
murdered,
not
a
deliberate
taker
of
human
life.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
though
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
those
two
arguments
because
in
combination
they
produce
still
a
third
constitutional
intention
which
is
the
narrowest
conceivable
ground
on
which
these
cases
could
be
decided.
in
as
mush
as
the
very
circumstance
which
we
contend
precludes
the
death
penalty
totally.
that
is
the
fact
that
sandra
lockett
has
been
condemned
for
a
crime
which
she
did
not
do,
did
not
attempt,
did
not
intend
and
it
is
to
kill.
in
as
much
as
that
factor
of
the
case,
it
is
one
of
the
very
factors
its
consideration
of
the
ohio
statute
precludes.
this
court
could
decide
these
cases
simply
on
the
ground
that
whether
or
not
it
would
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
a
case
like
this.
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
do
so
while
forbidding
the
sentence
or
even
to
consider
the
mitigating
circumstance,
that
the
defendant
was
not
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
and
neither
intended
nor
did
anything
in
furtherance
of
the
killing
itself
as
distinguished
in
the
underlying
robbery.
now,
that
argument
and
the
arguments
about
the
narrowness
of
the
ohio
statute
in
preclusion
of
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
chief
justice
burger.
there
is
no
attack
here
at
all
on
felony
murder
concept,
as
far
as
conviction
goes
that
is
perfectly
appropriate,
but
if
coker
has
any
meaning,
one
of
its
meanings
must
be
that
if
the
defendant’s
conviction
rests
only
on
the
felony
that
the
death
sentence
which
is
being
imposed
not
for
the
murder,
but
only
for
the
felony
is
disproportionate.
our
argument
goes
only
to
the
death
penalty
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
felony
murder
as
a
basic
conviction.
that
is
perfectly
acceptable,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
on
the
facts
of
this
case
however
is
the
fact
that
that
is
exactly
what
petitioner
is.
she
is
at
most
an
armed
robber.
she
has
the
mental
state,
the
culpability
of
any
participant
in
any
armed
robbery
and
no
more
than
that.
the
prosecution
in
its
brief
suggests
that
the
jury
must
have
found
that
the
defendant
intended
to
kill
sidney
cohen
because
part
of
the
element
of
aggravated
murder
is
purposely
killing.
i
want
to
dispel
that
theory
right
now.
it
is
true
that
the
court
charged
to
the
jury
that,
but
it
also
charge
to
the
jury
and
this
was
a
key
to
this
whole
case.
at
pages
118
and
119
of
the
appendix,
a
person
engaged
in
a
common
design
with
others
to
rsob
by
force
and
violence
on
individual
or
individuals
of
their
property
is
presumed
to
acquiesce
and
whatever
may
reasonably
be
necessary
to
accomplish
the
object.
if
under
the
circumstances
it
may
reasonably
be
expected
that
the
victim’s
life
would
be
in
danger
by
the
manner
and
means
of
performing
a
criminal
act,
each
one
engaged
in
a
common
design
is
bound
by
the
consequences
naturally
or
probably
arising
in
its
furtherance.
if
the
conspired
robbery
in
a
manner
of
its
accomplishment
would
be
reasonably
likely
to
produce
that,
each
plotter
is
equally
guilty
with
the
principle
offender
as
an
aider
and
abettor
in
a
homicide.
an
intent
to
kill
by
an
aider
and
abettor
may
be
found
on
to
exist
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
under
such
circumstances.
now,
later
on
that
same
page
the
court
defines,
intent
as
the
same
thing
as
purpose
and
elsewhere
in
this
charge,
it
talks
about
inferences
as
a
very
different
thing
for
presumption,
so
what
the
jury
was
charged
in
this
case,
was
that
it
should
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
purposely
killing
sydney
cohen
if
she
participated
in
an
armed
robbery
attempt.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed
her
convictions
on
exactly
that
theory,
indeed
the
very
issue
which
divided
the
ohio
supreme
court
here
four
to
three
would
never
reason
on
the
other
two.
so
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
has
been
sentenced
to
die
for
nothing
more
than
participation
in
an
armed
robbery
which
at
someone
else’s
hands
resulted
in
death,
no.
mr.
anthony
g.

their
involvement
could
on
a
factual
record
be
different
than
this
one
have
been
shown
to
be
more
substantial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice,
well
you
see
the
problem
with
analysis
like
that
as
we
are
talking
about
a
record
in
which
no
lawyer
was
addressing
the
question
of
lockett’s
culpability
and
so
i
just
do
not
know
the
answer
what
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
no
i
do
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
look
very
carefully
at
what
was
involved
in
coker
and
what
is
the
rationale
for
which
the
court
has
sustained
capital
punishment
and
all.
the
question
of
whose
finger
was
on
the
trigger
is
not
important,
but
the
question
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
a
participant
in
the
scheme
aimed
directly
and
deliberately
at
human
life
is
very
important
and
this
defendant
was
not
a
pointer
or
a
plot
in
a
scheme
to
kill.
now,
whether
james
lockett
was
or
not
your
honor
i
do
not
know,
this
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
someone
other
than
parker
on
this
record
might
be.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
parker,
well
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
may
i
distinguish
as
i
did
your
honor
two
separate
issues
-
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
on
these
people
at
all
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
the
other
is
to
whether
ohio
law
may
forbid
consideration
even
of
these
elements.
now,
i
will
go
this
far
with
no
hesitation
that
it
is
impermissible
constitutionally
for
ohio
to
forbid
consideration
of
the
fact
that
parker’s
shooting
was
accidental,
that
i
would
say
categorically.
that
is
to
say
even
if
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
on
parker,
for
ohio
to
say
as
it
has
that
whether
he
shot
and
deliberately
and
intentionally
killed
sydney
cohen
or
whether
they
gone
or
went
off
by
accident
is
not
relevant,
may
not
even
be
considered
in
sentencing
that
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
whether
ohio
could
say
that
an
unintended
killing
by
someone
who
is
their
taking
steps
toward
killing
with
a
knowledge
that
is
not
like,
that
poses
a
difficult
question
and
this
case
does
not
pose.
that
is
not
sandra
lockett,
that
might
be
james
lockett,
it
might
be
dew,
it
probably
is
parker
on
this
record,
but
it
certainly
is
not
sandra
because
sandra
lockett
at
most
was
aware
of
the
fact
the
people
were
going
in
the
store
with
a
loaded
gun.
no
indication
of
any
plan
as
to
how
it
would
be
used
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
simply
that
bullets
would
be
put
in
gun.
i
take
it
that
the
idea
of
putting
bullets
in
the
gun
does
not
necessarily
mean
to
fire
because
since
the
gun
was
being
taken
from
the
pawnshop
proprietor
since
he
would
know
that
empty
it
posed
no
threat.
they
would
have
to
load
it
in
order
to
pose
a
credible
threat
for
a
robbery,
so
there
is
no
supposition
whatever
that
anybody
intended
to
shoot
that
gun
and
mr.
justice
white
our
submission
does
not
tell
at
all
on
whose
finger
was
on
the
trigger
as
to
whether
to
use
the
language
of
the
gregg
case
itself.
the
defendant
has
been
sentenced
to
death
for
a
deliberate
killing
which
this
defendant
has
not.
if
a
defendant
is
part
of
a
scheme
in
which
somebody
else
shoots
that
just
as
deliberate
as
if
the
defendant
shoots
himself
or
herself.
i
would
like
to
leave
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
although
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
case,
i
think
that
this
has
sufficiently
presented
the
inner
relationship
that
the
issues,
and
strictly
the
narrowest
ground
of
decision,
so
that
it
provides
a
stopping
place,
unless
the
court
has
further
question.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
believe
under
our
state
of
law
that
is
not
the
law.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
disagree
entirely.
the
dialectic
is
the
same
as
i
disagree
with
counsel
entirely.
the
dialectic
is
the
same
that
is
in
jurek,
all
of
the
background
factors
were
considered
relevant
to
a
statutory
question
that
dialectic
is
the
same,
but
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
whether
that
the
question
is
a
broad
question
or
a
narrow
question.
the
question
in
texas
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
likely
to
commit
acts
of
dangers
and
in
the
future.
that
is
a
broad
question
that
opens
up
the
defendant’s
whole
life
and
in
fact
virtually
anything
is
relevant
to
that,
but
the
question
under
the
ohio
statute
whether
the
victim
induced
the
killing,
what
is
the
defendant’s
background
got
to
do
with
that
at
all,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
under
duress.
defendant’s
background
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
that?
mental
deficiency,
i
will
come
back
in
a
moment
to
speak
to
justice
powell’s
question
about
what
it
means?
but
what
it
means
is
something
very
very
narrow?
yes
justice
stevens,
i
agree
that
the
dynamic
is
the
same
but
the
problem
with
ohio
is
unlike
texas.
the
statutory
question
to
which
the
background
is
relevant
is
so
narrow
as
to
cut
out
most
of
the
defendant’s
life
with
a
result
that
the
kind
of
sending
people
to
the
death
is
a
place
where
is
undifferentiated
mass
which
the
court
condemned
which
happens
at
ohio
did
not
happen
in
texas.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
it
would
have
nothing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
except
if
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
except
if
that
is
defined
as
being
provocation,
but
justice
steven's
analysis
of
the
ohio
statute
is
exactly
right,
unless
one
of
those
three
factors
is
found
the
death
penalty
is
mandatory
and
what
that
means
is
that
every
factor
that
does
not
go
in
to
one
of
those
three
considerations
can
not
even
be
weighed.
it
is
irrelevant.
now,
the
breadth
of
those
factors
is
the
problem,
if
one
of
the
ohio
statutes
was
as
broad
as
question
number
two
in
jurek
will
the
defendant
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
question
that
opens
up
the
whole
affidavit
of
the
problem,
but
these
are
narrow
and
that
brings
me
to
justice
powell’s
question.
justice
powell,
may
i
now
direct
your
honors
attention
to
page
141
of
the
appendix,
in
which
the
trial
judge
here
explicitly
defined
mental
deficiency.
the
trial
judge
and
now
this
is
justice
powell
on
the
triar
of
fact.
this
is
trial
condemned
sandra
lockett
on
the
points
of
fact
under
the
statute.
this
has
no
juror,
judge
is
making
a
decision.
the
judge
says,
mental
retardation
and
mental
deficiency
under
the
law
are
synonymous
and
many
goes
onto
read
out
of
the
dsm
2
that
is
diagnostic
and
statistical
manual
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
ii
edition,
the
number
categorizing,
is
saying
that
not
only
his
mental
deficiency
identical
to
mental
retardation,
you
do
not
have
the
score
--
but
you
have
to
score
about
70
you
are
not
retarded.
that
is
why
we
say
that
always
business
about
how
broadly
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
construed
the
statute
as
non
sentencing.
the
only
case
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
given
a
broad
construction,
the
mental
deficiency
of
the
black
patient,
it
did
not
apply
the
statute
to
any
state
of
facts
in
the
black
patient,
simply
answering
a
constitutional
challenge
that
the
statute
is
weighed
for
vagueness,
wherever
it
has
had
to
apply
the
term
mental
deficiency
to
state
of
facts,
it
has
said
that
educational
deprivation
is
not
mental
deficiency,
cultural
deprivation
is
not
mental
deficiency,
emotional
deprivation
is
not
mental
deficiency,
it
means
mental
retardation
and
if
it
meant
more
than
that
this
case
would
have
to
be
reversed
because
the
trial
judge
found
the
facts,
found
them
on
the
theory
that
the
defendant
could
be
found
to
have
a
mitigating
circumstance
and
to
escape
the
death
penalty,
only
if
you
are
mentally
retarded.
now,
that
brings
me
back
to
the
question
of
degree
of
culpability
being
considered
and
if
i
may
speak
again
to
the
felony
murder
question,
because
i
think
i
were
being
very
unclear
on
ohio
law
as
to
this,
and
this
is
a
key
question,
everyone
has
asked
about
it,
i
think
it
needs
to
be
be
cleared
off.
the
answer
is
that
ohio
does
not
have
the
traditional
felony
murder
rule,
that
justice
stewart
and
justice
rehnquist
were
talking
about.
if
you
look
at
page
205
of
the
appendix,
the
ohio
supreme
court
says
that
it
does.
under
ohio
and
this
is
not
for
aggravated
murder,
this
is
for
first
degree
murder
at
all.
there
has
got
to
be
a
purposeful
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
but
what
they
then
say
is
that
any
felony
which
is
done
with
a
deadly
weapon
creates
a
risk
of
death
as
its
natural
and
probable
consequence
and
that
one
who
engages
in
such
a
felony
is
presumed
to
have
intended
to
kill.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
equivalent
of
that
justice
rehnquist,
that
what
it
is
that
they
have
a
different
logic
but
it
reaches
the
same
result.
most
states
said
if
you
have
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
you
do
not
have
to
intent,
you
get
felony
murder.
ohio
says
you
have
to
have
an
intentional
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony,
but
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony
with
a
deadly
weapon
is
presumed
to
be
intentional
killing,
so
you
get
to
exactly
the
same
result
and
justice
rehnquist
in
terms
of
the
answer
of
your
question
presumed
does
not
mean
to
infer,
if
your
honor
looks
at
page
117
of
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
the
trial
judge
in
charging
the
jury
defines
an
inference
for
the
jury,
and
that
is
very
different
from
what
it
says
about
presumption
on
pages
118
and
119,
this
is
not
simply
an
inference.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
totally
agree,
but
the
point
is
that
every
judge
who
has
considered
this
case
below
has
taken
the
position
the
sandra
lockett
was
convicted
not
because
in
fact
she
intended
sydney
cohen’s
death,
not
because
the
jury
could
have
inferred
that
but
because
ohio
law
says
that
if
you
engage
in
an
armed
felony,
you
are
presumed;
language
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
that
liability
is
attached
to
the
defendant,
ascribe
to
the
defendant,
this
is
not
language
of
inference.
this
is
the
language
that
says
the
defendant
is
treated
as
though
she
intended
killing
sydney
cohen
even
though
she
did
not
and
mr.
chief
justice
the
answer
to
the
question
of
what
would
the
jury
have
done
if
it
had
found
that
she
did
not
intend
to
kill,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
this
jury
following
these
instructions
could
not
have
found
that
she
did
not
intend
to
kill
because
if
they
followed
the
instructions
they
were
given,
they
had
to
find
that
if
she
engaged
in
a
plan
to
participate
in
armed
robbery
that
she
was
presumed
to
intend
to
kill
so
this
jury
could
not
have
acquitted.
the
facts
of
this
record
--.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
the
ohio
version
if
you
will
of
a
felony
murder
rule,
although
the
trappings
of
it
are
different,
the
result
is
exactly
the
same.
so
what
we
have
is
a
case,
in
which
the
following
are
the
facts
and
not
only
resulted
in
the
death
sentence
but
were
not
even
permitted
to
be
considered
by
the
sentence
served
and
here
again
is
my
major
disagreement
with
counsel.
these
facts
because
relevant
only
to
three
narrow
issues
which
do
not
in
fact
make
that
relevant,
do
not
enter
in
the
sentencing
(inaudible).
defendant
not
only
was
not
the
triggerman,
that
is
not
terribly
the
point,
but
the
defendant
did
not
herself
participate
in
any
plan
or
scheme
that
in
corpus
killing
as
a
part
of
the
design.
her
culpability
is
no
greater
than
that
of
any
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
i
would
agree
that
that
factual
finding
is
supported,
but
your
honor
what
this
court
said
in
gregg
was
that
if
that
any
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
your
honor
it
is
more
i
think
presumed
what
the
ohio
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
point
of
mine
is
a
pure
and
unmitigated
fiction,
your
honor
is
it
not?
is
it
what
the
court
said
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
holmes
once
pointed
out
that
even
a
dog
knows
the
difference
between
being
kicked
and
tripped
off
and
what
the
ohio
statute
says,
if
that
you
can
trip
over
a
dog
you
are
presumed
to
kicked;
in
short,
the
defendant’s
actual
intent
to
participate
in
a
killing
is
irrelevant
if
the
ohio
court
deems
that
death
may
result
from
a
dangerous
robbery
the
defendant
is
presumed
deemed,
treated
as
though,
she
committed
the
deliberate
intentional
killing
which
this
court
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
nothing
distinguishes
parker
from
the
defendant
in
this
case
except
the
state’s
decision
not
to
treat
them
as
capitally
punishable
offender.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
use
of
a
felony
murder
rule
as
a
fiction
and
the
question
as
mr.
justice
stewart
put
it,
is
whether
life
or
death
may
turn
on
it.
certainly,
some
fictions
cannot
be
used
in
the
law
that
the
pinage
case
has
held
that
you
cannot
forbid
slavery
and
you
cannot
say
anybody
who
breaks
a
labor
contract
is
deemed
to
have
intended
at
the
time
he
entered
into
it
to
have
defrauded
and
therefore
you
can
specifically
enforce
it
that
is
involuntary
service.
but
here
we
say
ohio
is
done
the
same
thing.
it
has
used
a
fiction
that
treats
a
non-murderer
as
a
murderer
and
this
court
said
in
gregg,
the
death
penalty
was
forced
in
for
deliberate
murder.
that
is
not
the
defendant’s
say
by
fiction
that
fiction
we
say
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
absolutely.
the
two
authors
of
bill
have
said
in
their
own
article
that
describing
what
happened
that
the
statute
with
which
were
confronted
here
was
due
to
senate
amendments
to
a
house
version
that
would
not
represent
any
of
these
problems
of
course
that
said.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
sir.
