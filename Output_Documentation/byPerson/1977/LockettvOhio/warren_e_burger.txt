chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
6997
lockett
v.
ohio.
mr.
amsterdam
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
totally
outside
of
the
plan,
and
i
am
not
sure
what
do
you
mean
by
that
--
stands
of
death
and
they
had
bullets
in
the
gun,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course,
i
suppose
on
that
theory
the
perpetrators
would
not
need
any
bullets
in
the
gun,
if
they
had
no
intention
or
whatever
making
using
of,
would
they?
would
an
empty
pistol
not
have
done
just
as
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
loaded
it
there
i
had
recall
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
asking
us
to
abolish
the
concept
of
felony
murder,
felony
homicide?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
amsterdam.
mr.
layman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
verdict
should
the
jury
have
returned
if
they
were
persuaded
that
it
was
unintended,
accidental
killing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
anyway
the
jury
could
have
returned
to
verdict
of
less
than
the
degree
they
did,
had
they
believed
the
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thanks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
she
have
the
same
opportunity
to
plead
guilty
to
that
lesser
in
go
to
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
that
was
the
same
degree
that
parker
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
still
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
whether
her
counsel
recommended
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
a
question
of
degree
of
discretion
or
it
is
the
question
that
they
have
totally
different
functions,
that
is
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
amsterdam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
that
last
point
you
made,
i
am
a
little
confused.
suppose
a
woman
hired
a
man
to
kill
her
husband
so
that
she
could
marry
someone
else.
do
you
suggest
that
under
ohio
law
or
in
imposing
the
penalty
that
her
background
would
have
nothing
to
do
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
record
showed
that
on
one
another
occasion
she
had
been
charged
with
the
same
offense,
but
found
not
guilty
by
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
show
her
state
of
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
law
of
a
felony
murder
that
you
have
just
stated
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
two
cases,
76-6997
lockett
against
ohio
and
76-6513,
bell
against
ohio.
each
of
these
involving
the
death
penalty
statutes
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
of
four
of
the
justices
supported
by
others
who
joined
the
judgment.
the
judgment
of
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
affirmed
as
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
each
case,
but
reversed
in
each
case
to
the
extent
that
those
judgments
sustain
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
and
the
cases
are
each
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
judgments.
justices
white,
marshall,
blackmun
and
rehnquist,
each
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
the
case.
