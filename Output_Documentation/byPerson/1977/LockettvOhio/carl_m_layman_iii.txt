mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
turn
the
record
to
the
death
penalty
issue
first
and
if
there
is
time
remaining,
i
will
address
the
prosecutor’s
comment
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
was
not
an
accidental
killing,
that
would
be
contrary
to
what
the
jury
found
and
that
the
evidence
in
the
appendix
supports
al
parker’s
testimony
and
in
fact
there
is
a
plan
to
commit
a
robbery
and
which
it
is
reasonably
foreseeable
that
deadly
force
will
be
used.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
it
was
accidental
would
have
to
be
not
guilty.
if
it
was
unintentional
--
there
is
a
difference,
in
ohio
but
accidental
would
not
be
guilty.
if
it
was
unintentional
in
a
sense
that
they
did
not
have
what
we
now
determined
or
call
purposeful,
but
before
it
was
an
intentional
act
it
would
then
involuntary
manslaughter
under
statute.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
that
it
was
not
an
accident
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
and
the
testimony
was
not
just
al
parker’s,
joanne
baxter
testified
concerning
the
planning
and
the
use
of
a
weapon
by
this
group
on
two
different
occasions
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
dreamed
up
the
idea
of
robbery.
she
thought
of
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
that
we
could
pick
up
out
grocery
store
named
easters,
but
you
got
to
get
the
duties
big
and
he
has
got
45
so
it
is
in
her
mind,
it
is
in
the
conspirator’s
mind
that
the
force
will
be
used.
now,
they
did
not
sit
down
and
plan
i
am
going
to
go
and
kill
this
guy
and
then
rob
it;
no,
but
the
idea
of
aiding
and
abetting,
the
idea
of
felony
murder
is
established
in
ohio.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
ohio
presumes
the
intent
or
infers
the
intent
that
you
would
say
as
lacking
in
your
example.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
show
the
common
law
scheme
of
a
felony
murder,
then
the
ohio
law
says
that
each
of
the
participants
whether
or
not
they
are
was
a
triggerman
has
that
intent
or
that
purpose
but
you
have
to
find
that
they
were
part
of
it,
and
that
was
reasonably
foreseeable
that
force
will
be
used.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
the
intent
to
commit
an
offense.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
you
have
to
find
a
specific
intent
through
the
inferences
coming
through
aiding
and
abetting
and
felony
murder
rules.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
right,
but
you
can
presume
that
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
crime
itself.
what
mr.
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
yes
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
mitigating
factors
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
that
is
correct.
she
did
not
want
to
go
in
because
she
was
known
there.
i
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
do
not
believe
necessarily.
there
could
have
been
other
witnesses
there,
other
people
who
do
were
from
that
pawnshop.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
total
answer
to
that.
turning
to
the
mitigation
phase
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
substantially
broadened
the
initial
conception
or
definitions
of
mental
deficiency
and
psychosis
and
i
point
them
out
in
my
brief,
they
are
specifically
state
v.
black
and
state
v.
bell
where
they
broaden
the
interpretation
and
while
it
is
true
that
you
take
all
these
factors
in
consideration
in
reaching
the
one
of
the
three
specific
statutory
grounds
for
mitigation,
the
court
does
consider
them.
they
do
consider
each
one
of
the
factors
that
the
petitioner
complains
about
the
age,
the
mental
state,
the
degree
of
participation
all
work
together
in
reaching
one
of
the
statutory
grounds
and
i
asked
this
court
to
compare
this
framework,
ohio’s
framework
with
that
of
texas
wherein
any
evidence
of
mitigation
was
not
in
and
of
itself
a
basis
for
mitigation,
but
had
to
be
utilized
in
answering
a
specific
question
and
in
jurek
it
was
whether
or
not
the
defendant
would
be
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
each
one
of
those
factors
was
not
in
and
of
themselves
significant,
that
a
degree
of
participation
or
the
age
or
use
or
the
mental
state,
but
they
were
all
taken
in
consideration
through
the
judicial
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
do
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
ohio.
ohio
does
consider
these
factors
in
reaching
their
decision.
petitioner
claims
that
this
mitigating
factor
never
works
and
it
is
not
true
nathan
earl
dew
was
mitigated
on
this
theory
ground,
a
co-conspirator
of
the
petitioner,
but
nathan
earl
dew
was
the
pawn
that
was
directed
by
the
petitioner
who
planned
this,
who
directed
them
to
go
to
sidney
cohen.
she
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
likelihood
of
force,
of
violent
force
in
reaching
the
robbery
and
carrying
out
the
robbery,
therefore
you
have
the
rule
at
least
in
ohio
the
felony
murder
rule
and
the
fact
that
aiders
and
abettors
are
punished
equally
with
the
principal.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
but
she
is
the
one
that
was
the
mastermind
of
the
crime.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
because
in
considering
as
black
defines
the
third
mitigating
factor,
the
mental
state,
the
emotional
state
and
the
degree
of
participation
in
it.
she
was
the
mastermind.
she
directed
this
person
and
you
look
at
nathan
earl
dew’s
mind,
his
emotional
state
and
you
look
at
sandra
lockett
and
she
is
more
culpable
and
when
you
talk
about
well,
do
you
have
to
intend
to
commit
the
murder
and
intend
to
kill,
i
say
no,
you
can
consider
though
that
in
mitigation,
but
it
should
not
be
in
and
of
itself,
the
mitigating
factor,
but
it
is
considered
in
ohio’s
framework,
in
2904
(b)
when
you
consider
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
as
well
as
the
history
of
character
and
condition
of
the
defendant.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
well,
i
think
it
could
be
considered
under
anyone
of
them
in
that,
in
reading
the
first
part
of
it
under
the
first
paragraph
of
b
when
you
consider
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
in
reaching
this
and
was
this
a
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
your
honor
the
jury
does
not
take
part
in
the
final
sentencing
phase.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
ohio
supreme
court
did
not
make
an
expressed
determination
on
that
issue
and
i
am
saying
that
you
cannot
consider
all
of
the
established
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
not
those
specific
terms
as
i
stated
in
state
v.
black
was
in
the
most
recent
broadening.
it
talked
about
the
mental
state
and
the
things
that
go
into
your
mental
state
or
your
emotional
state
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
consider
whether
there
was
a
cold
calculative
plan
by
the
petitioner
to
carry
out
a
crime
as
opposed
to
some
bizarre
behavior
or
some
unplanned
kind
of
behavior
and
look
at
the
degree
of
participation
in
that
sense
in
reaching
the
mental
state
or
the
emotional
state
of
the
defendant.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
am
referring
to
your
honor,
a
broadening
interpretation
by
the
court
of
that
specific
language
that
state
v.
black
and
cited
in
my
brief
the
citation
and
ohio
supreme
court
as
48,
ohio
state
ii,
262
which
broadens
the
interpretation
of
the
definition
of
that
particular
statute.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
your
honor
i
think
that
is
answered
in
gregg
and
the
other
cases
in
terms
of
the
necessity
for
plea
bargaining,
court
approved
prove
plea
bargaining
and
when
you
are
considering
that,
you
are
considering
something
different
than
what
is
before
this
court
today,
the
use
of
mercy,
the
use
of
plea
bargaining
are
as
i
understand
did
not
the
same
kinds
of
considerations
as
you
have
in
this
case.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
that
is
not
correct
because
parker
did
plead
guilty
to
aggravated
murder
and
perhaps.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
without
an
aggravating
specification
which
is
necessary
to
get
to
the
death
penalty,
you
still
have
the
same
main
charge
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
under
ohio
statute,
the
aggravating
specification
was
committing
the
aggravated
murder
while
committing
another
crime
and
this
was
to
what
aggravated
robbery.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
before
trial,
she
was
offered
voluntary
manslaughter,
during
trial
she
was
twice
offered
aggravated
murder
without
the
specification
and
she
refused
both.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
during
trial
that
was
the
same
degree.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
before
that
the
voluntary
manslaughter
case
would
only
carry
was
it
a
4
to
25
sentence,
much
less
than
even
aggravated
murder
case,
but
she
did
not
accept
that
at
all.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
yes,
they
did.
it
shows
that
and
they
did
recommend
it
and
she
did
not
accept
it
and
it
is
on
the
record
at
least
in
two
instances
that
they
wanted
to
put
in
the
record
the
offer
has
been
made
do
you
want
to
accept
it
and
i
do
not
know
the
rationale,
there
is
one
digression
in
the
record
where
her
mother
is
present
and
apparently
has
influence
on
petitioner.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
say
that
those
are
the
reasons
that
went
into
the
plead
bargaining.
was
the
strength
of
the
case,
whether
or
not
you
could
convict
defendant
on
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
would
agree
to
that
extent
yes.
once
you
have
got
to
a
conviction
of
aggravated
murder
with
the
specification
of
it.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
obviously
that
is
true.
they
have
different
functions
and
i
do
not
know
that
is
the
kind
of
questions
that
we
were
dealing
with
when
you
are
saying
whether
or
not
this
person
has
been
offered
to
plead
before
the
trial
and
then
having
gone
through
the
trial,
but
you
have
the
same
considerations
to
be
facing
not
only
the
prosecutor
but
the
trial
court.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
if
none
of
the
mitigating
factors
are
found
that
is
true.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
death
penalty
is
disproportionate
for
this
petitioner
because
she
did
not
commit
the
crime
of
aggravated
murder
with
the
intent
to
kill
sydney
cohen,
but
this
totally
ignores
the
rule
of
aiding
and
abetting
and
a
felony
murder
as
it
is
present
in
ohio
and
in
federal
case
law,
i
cases
pointed
out
and
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
that
is
true
and
i
am
saying
that
it
is
considered,
however
in
relying
on
coker
in
the
disproportionality
kind
of
argument
you
are
saying
that
she
is
less
culpable
than
the
triggerman
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
can
say
per
se
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
true
but
i
think
culpability
is
one
of
the
things
that
are
used
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
sentence
is
imposed
properly
or
not.
what
degree
of
culpability,
what
degree
of
planning
and
participation
that
she
have
in
this
crime?
did
she
bring
it
about
and
if
this
court
has
to
say
that
the
evolving
standard
of
decency
argument
as
well
as
the
disproportionate
argument
of
coker
and
gregg
is
to
apply
then
you
would
have
to
make
a
rule
where
person
who
was
classified
as
an
aider
and
abettor
or
has
a
lesser
degree
of
participation
than
the
triggerman
then
you
have
to
overturn
ohio
case
law
on
aiding
and
abetting.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
agree
with
that
your
honor;
however,
in
this
case
you
have
a
very
narrow
category
of
murder
that
is
before
the
court
aggravated
murder
only
applies
to
a
very
narrow
category
of
murders.
the
person
has
to
be
either
committing
a
felony
murder,
and
murder
for
a
higher,
very
narrow
group
of
and
only
then
do
you
get
to
the
question
of
mitigating
process
and
when
you
review
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
crime
here,
i
think
there
is
sufficient
evidence
before
the
mitigating
authority
or
the
punishing
authority
to
say
that
the
crime
committed
was
of
a
degree
of
culpability,
meriting
with
death
penalty
and,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
first
issue,
i
might
for
just
a
moment
and
discuss
the
prosecutor’s
closing
argument.
petitioner
primarily
relies
on
griffin
v.
california
which
discussed
the
direct
comment
of
the
prosecutor
that
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
and
did
not
see
fit
to
explain
the
state’s
evidence.
this
is
not
the
case
here.
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
made
the
comment
that
the
evidence
was
unrefuted
and
uncontradicted
but
did
not
directly
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
that
is
true
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
defense
attorney
and
the
defense
did
not
put
any
evidence,
but
two
things
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
the
prosecutor’s
comments
were
not
objected
to
a
trial
and
there
was
an
instruction
given
regarding
the
defendant’s
theory
to
testify
by
the
trial
court
that
they
could
not
take
that
into
consideration
which
was
directly
contrary
to
the
griffin
instruction
where
they
have
told
that
they
could
take
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
but
in
relation
to
this
then
the
state
would
urge
that,
first
there
is
a
waiver
issue
under
estelle
and
additionally
that
it
would
be
harmless
error.
either
one
of
these
factors
would
be
sufficient
to
refute
the
petitioner’s
comment,
however
i
do
not
believe
that
even
in
and
of
itself
that
the
comments
were
such
that
they
were
err.
i
think
you
can
distinguish
them
clearly
from
the
griffin
case.
now,
there
is
one
other
issue
the
fourth
one
that
is
raised
about
whether
or
not
this
is
a
new
interpretation
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
a
new
interpretation,
that
it
is
the
same
and
as
it
has
always
been.
the
legislative
commission
notes
state
that
this
is
a
codification
of
the
old
law.
the
trial
court
in
its
charge
as
pointed
by
petitioner’s
counsel,
read
the
old
law.
the
very
quotes
he
gave
you
from
that
charge
were
the
old
law
on
aiding
and
abetting,
unless
there
is
no
change
and
the
petitioner
had
noticed,
the
old
law
was
to
be
applied.
i
would
also
submit
that
this
issue
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation
and
while
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
that
it
is
this
court’s
duty
to
ensure
that
the
statutes
are
interpreted
correctly,
still
one
of
statutory
interpretation
and
absence
a
constitutional
issue
which
they
tried
to
bring
in
to
this
case
the
retroactivity
of
a
change
in
the
law,
the
statutory
interpretation
should
be
followed.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
yes.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
no,
that
is
not
correct.
you
can
consider
it
as
i
quoted
the
statute
and
that
you
can
not
only
consider
the
nature
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
but
you
can
take
into
consideration
the
character,
history
and
condition
of
the
defendant
and
the
history
clearly
includes
just
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
that
is
true,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
it
is
one
of
the
factors
that
is
to
be
considered
among
many
others
in
determining
sentence.
it
is
not
just
the
single
factor
but
it
is
given
some
consideration
or
guidelines
for
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases,
just
the
way
there
is
guideline
set
up
for
the
mitigation
fees.
under
all
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
there
are
more
statutory
and
numerated
mitigating
factors
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
am
not
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
i
think
that
because
the
court
made
its
ruling
that
they
wanted
to
set
up
some
guidelines,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessarily,
constitutionally
required
that
it
have
all
the
same
considerations
that
you
would
have,
for
instance
even
before
that.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
now
you
still
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
mr.
justice
stevens,
you
have
the
same
ability
to
make
these
considerations
in
going
and
deciding
the
question
of
one
of
the
statutory
question
--
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
that
is
true
but
in
the
same
manners
in
texas
where
they
do
not
have
this
as
a
statutory
basis
for
mitigation,
then
you
have
to
answer
the
question.
is
there
going
to
be
a
continuing
threat.
you
consider
the
past
record.
you
consider
the
degree
of
culpability.
all
of
these
things
go
into
answering
that
question
but
this
court
did
not
require
texas
to
set
out
as
a
statutory
grounds,
anyone
of
those
factors
specifically
and
say
this
is
a
statutory
grounds
for
mitigation.
mr.
carl
m.
layman,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
trial
judge
here
has
the
benefit
of
a
psychiatric
report,
pre-sentence
investigation.
he
has
a
great
deal
of
information
to
work
with
in
making
his
decision
and
it
is
required
by
statute
that
the
trial
court
have
these
basis
for
making
his
decision
so
that
the
court
does
have
sufficient
information
to
look
at
the
background
in
the
condition
of
the
defendant.
that
is
apparent
in
this
record
where
you
can
now
see
that
the
pre-sentence
report,
the
psychiatric
examinations
were
all
placed
in
the
record
and
were
considered
by
the
trial
court.
if
i
might
quote
justice
stewart
in
closing
in
gregg,
justice
stewart
stated
that
as
a
heavy
burden
which
rests
on
those
who
attack
the
judgment
of
the
representatives,
the
people.
and
the
caution
is
necessary
as
this
court
become
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
the
standards
of
criminal
responsibility
throughout
the
country
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
admonition
applies
equally
well
on
this
case
because
we
have
a
state
that
it
is
not
the
exactly
like
any
other
state.
it
is
not
exactly
like
florida,
it
is
not
exactly
like
georgia
or
texas,
but
it
provides
mitigating
factors
which
channel
the
discretion,
give
guidelines
to
the
sentencing
authority.
and
i
think
that
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
this
case
is
not
one
of
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
it
gives
sufficient
guidelines
to
make
the
decision
to
the
sentencing
theory.
thank
you.
