justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
do
you
do
when
you
have
as
counsel,
uncontradicted
evidence?
you
mean
you
cannot
tell
the
jury
is
uncontradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
just
state
one
point
of
course
you
can
always
say
it
is
uncontradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
defendant
does
not
testify
and
puts
on
no
defense,
then
the
prosecutor
cannot
say
that
his
testimony
that
he
has
produced
is
uncontradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
he
say
it
three
or
four
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
do
not
see
how
you
can
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
muzzle
the
prosecutor
by
your
trial
tactics?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
many
cases
i
have
tried,
if
you
were
to
let
me
say,
uncontradicted
i
would
not
have
argued
because
i
was
so
happy
to
have
them
contradicted.
you
cannot
say
you
muzzle
the
prosecutor
that
way,
and
as
defense
counsel,
i
am
for
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
the
defendant
did
not
put
on
any
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
have
accidental
homicide
in
a
felony,
in
a
commission
of
a
felony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
said
it
could
be
an
accidental,
did
not?
i
thought
she
was
saying
something
that
really
did
not
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
point
as
i
understood
it
was
not
that
she
should
not
be
convicted
or
she
should
not
be
given
the
death
penalty.
is
that
not
his
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
culpability,
i
am
talking
about
sentencing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
also
said
that
the
defense
did
not
put
on
any
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
was
in
addition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
not
involved
in
this
case,
it
has
always
been
(inaudible)
for
me
to
going
to
person
and
comment
on
the
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
as
a
judge,
specifically
the
instruction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
very
vigorously
that
this
was
a
fiction.
it
is
not
the
concept
of
felony
murder
a
legal
fiction
in
the
classical
sense?
