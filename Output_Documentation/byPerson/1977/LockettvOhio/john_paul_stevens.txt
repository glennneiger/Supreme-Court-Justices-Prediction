justice
john
paul
stevens
in
non-capital
cases?
is
there
any
reason
why
it
is
correct,
is
it
not
that
that
prior
criminal
record
is
not
--
the
court
is
not
permitted
to
take
it
into
consideration,
the
capital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
just
for
the
purpose
of
the
determining
whether
there
was
duress
or
whether
was
mental?
just
for
the
purpose
of
determining,
one
of
the
three
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
non-capital
case,
it
is
given
independent
significance,
is
it
not?
is
not
the
practice
of
the
judge
to
give
it
independent
weight
in
determining
what
kind
of
a
sentence
to
impose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
more
mitigating
circumstances
that
may
be
considered
in
a
non-capital
case,
than
may
be
considered
in
a
capital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
sound
like
a
plan
--
the
legislature
would
have
adopted,
but
it
had
not
failed
but
it
was
compelled
to
by
the
furman
case
do
you
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
defend
that
really
as
a
sensible
way
to
go
about
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
capital
case,
a
judge
would
have
less
latitude
than
in
another
kind
of
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
weired
to
me
frankly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
capital
sentence
shall
be
imposed.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
one
of
these
three
mitigating
circumstances
are
present?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
trial
judge
in
ohio
has
as
much
discretion
as
the
trial
judge
in
texas,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
amsterdam
before
you
start
will
you
tell
us
whether
you
are
asking
as
to
overrule
the
jury
and
if
not
whether
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
the
jury
of
the
texas
case.
your
opponent
argues
that
the
ohio
judge
has
just
as
much
discretion
as
the
texas
judge
that
the
standards
that
if
we
follow
the
jurek
case
where
we
have
to
affirm
this
conviction?
