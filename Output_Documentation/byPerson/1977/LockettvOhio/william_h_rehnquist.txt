rehnquist
then
they
have
a
felony
murder

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
these
are
questions
that
courts
in
one
opinion,
you
will
find
misstate
or
confuse
presumption
in
the
inference
and
i
would
not
be
willing
to
take
a
face
value
of
anyone
single
statement
in
a
charge
to
a
jury
has
been
conclusive
on
a
stateâ€™s
law?
