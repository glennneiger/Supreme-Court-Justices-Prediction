unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
jury,
jurors
and
intelligent
jurors
do
not
ask
that
question
of
themselves
even
if
the
prosecutor
had
never
mentioned
a
word
about
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam
--
unknown
speaker
i
trust
mr.
amsterdam,
you
are
not
going
to
consume
all
of
your
time
on
this
question.
there
are
other
questions
in
this
case
and
i
think
you
may
fairly
assume
that
some
of
those
have
ordered
a
grant
certiorari
in
this
case
where
i
understood
there
was
no
other
questions?
unknown
speaker
you
can
then
answer
this
one
yes
or
no
though
was
there
an
instruction
in
this
case,
any
of
instruction
from
the
court
as
to
the
significance
of
the
defendant’s
testimony?
unknown
speaker
that
says
no
significance
should
be
attached
to
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
this
first
question
is
covered
in
your
brief,
it
is
covered
in
your
brief
is
it
not;
the
first
question
yes?
unknown
speaker
but
the
same
thing
goes
for
james
lockett
and
dew?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
on
this
record,
how
about
james
lockett,for
example?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
say
that
only
the
triggerman
may
be
punished?
unknown
speaker
who
else
may
be
anybody
who
had
the
intent
that
there
be
a
death?
unknown
speaker
well,
arguably
under
your
rule
parker
perhaps
would
not
be
the
subject
to
the
death
penalty
either?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
parker?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
accidentally
and
that
the
plan
did
not
include
any
intent
to
cause
death?
unknown
speaker
at
the
common
law
there
could
be
felony
murder
that
was
purely
accidental.
in
other
words,
cat
burglar
climbing
up
slate
roof
could
dislodge
one
of
the
slates
and
strike,
walk
in
a
pedestrian
on
the
head
and
kill
him
and
that
would
be
a
felony
murder
of
common
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
i
may
mr.
layman
i
understood
you
to
say
in
response
to
justice
stewart’s
question
i
believe
it
was
a
moment
ago
that
ohio
does
not
follow
the
ordinary
concept
of
felony
murder
at
least
what
i
consider
to
be
the
ordinary
concept
of
felony
murder
and
that
is
that
if
one
goes
into
the
convenient
store
with
a
gun
intending
to
rob
the
proprietor
and
the
gun
goes
off
accidentally
in
a
course
of
commission
of
the
robbery,
he
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
what
i
understood
to
be
classical
felony
murder
law?
unknown
speaker
what
intent
-
the
intent
to
kill
or
the
intent
to
rob?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
it
is
in
this
instruction
to
the
jury,
it
must
be
established
in
this
case
that
at
the
time
and
question
that
was
present
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant’s
specific
intent
to
kill
sidney
cohen.
does
that
mean
what
it
says
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
somebody
has
to
have
this
specific
intent
to
kill?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
presume,
do
you
mean
the
same
thing
as
infer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
layman,
just
one
detail,
you
mentioned
the
testimony
about
her
actual
intent,
does
the
record
not
tell
us
why
she
did
not
go
into
the
pawnshop?
unknown
speaker
but
does
not
that
suggest
she
really
did
not
expect
the
man
to
be
killed?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
she
had
knowledge
that
the
dew
did
not
have?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
statute
how
is
their
principle
waived
to
differentiate
between
the
two,
give
her
the
death
penalty
and
that
give
it
to
dew.
unknown
speaker
on
that
degree
of
participation,
do
you
say
that
ohio
court
may
consider
it,
it
does
not
fit
within
the
language
of
anyone
of
the
three
specified
mitigating
circumstances,
does
it?
but
though
would
you
point
the
language
out
to
me,
we
talked
to
you
today
but
it
said
mitigating
circumstance,
that
the
offense
was
a
product
of
psychosis
or
mental
deficiency,
but
under
which
one
of
those
stands
would
you
include
degree
of
participation
in
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
was
the
jury
so
instructed
in
this
case,
specifically?
unknown
speaker
i
have
not
checked
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
since
you
made
this
point
but
did
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
this
case
construe
either
one
of
these
stands,
psychosis
or
mental
deficiency
as
including
degree
of
participation
in
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
does
so
include
degree
of
participation
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
did
not
say
mental
state,
it
says
mental
deficiency.
i
agree
with
what
you
say
and
my
difficulty
is
whether
or
not
it
comes
within
the
statute
and
whether
juries
are
so
instructed?
unknown
speaker
and
we
are
to
read
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
is
it
that
what
you
are
telling?
unknown
speaker
i
should
not
perhaps
dwell
on
this
but
what
about
the
disparity
between
parker
and
lockett?
how
can
state
of
ohio
conclude
that
parker
did
not
commit
aggravated
murder
and
the
lockett
did?
unknown
speaker
that
has
accepted
a
plead
from
him
which
necessarily
was
a
determination
that
he
did
not
commit
aggravated
murder,
was
that
not?
and
now
in
a
separate
proceeding
out
of
the
same
incidence
taking
the
position
that
lockett
did
commit,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
was
it
a
murder
without
aggravation
or
something
i
do
not
mean
i
understood--?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
aggravating
specification
that
justifies
the
death
penalty
against
lockett
and
was
not
present
with
respect
to
parker?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
correct
reading
of
the
ohio
statute
that
whatever
factors
may
have
persuaded
the
prosecutor
that
a
sentence
of
4
to
25
years
would
have
been
appropriate
in
this
case
and
she
was
sitting
outside
or
whatever
might
be.
those
factors
could
not
be
considered
by
the
sentencing
judge,
he
had
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
has
considerably
less
discretion
than
the
prosecutor,
that
much
it
clear,
a
sentencing
judge?
unknown
speaker
what
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
if
the
defendant
fails
to
establish
anyone
of
the
three
mitigating
circumstances,
the
statute
is
mandatory
in
the
sense
that
it
requires
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
not
involved
here
with
a
question
of
ohio
law,
we
assume
the
ohio
law
has
been
settled
by
your
legislature
and
by
your
supreme
court
construing
its
enactments,
but
the
question
is
that
ohio
law
in
its
application
to
this
case,
compatible
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
is
our
question.
i
mean
ohio
law
could
conceivably
make
any
unlawful
killing
or
murder
punishable
by
death
and
there
might
be
no
question
about
what
the
ohio
law
was
so
that
a
person
speeding
and
had
again
killing
a
pedestrian
would
be
guilty
of
murder
in
ohio
and
punishable
by
death.
that
would
not
solve
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
or
not
the
ohio
law
in
its
application
to
the
hypothetical
case,
i
posed
was
a
constitutional
law?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
the
death
penalty
problem
for
just
a
moment.
under
ohio
criminal
practice
generally,
is
it
normally
the
practice
to
take
into
consideration
the
prior
criminal
record
of
the
defendant
in
the
sentencing
determination?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
say
that
she
participated
in
the
plan
where
it
was
reasonably
likely
that
a
killing
would
take
place
that
is
what
it
said?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
more
than
the
saying
it
is
presumed.
they
are
ultimate,
their
bottom
line
was
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
on
this
record
sandra
lockett
intended
to
kill
that
was
their
bottom
line?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
is
page
2
that
the
record
reflects
that
this
was
the
case
and
establishes
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
appellant
had
a
purposeful
intent
to
kill
that
is
their
bottom
line;
however,
they
got
there?
unknown
speaker
i
know
they
say
that
if
you
are
engaged
in
a
plan
where
one
of
the
reasonable
results
would
be
a
killing?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
am
just
saying
what
they
said?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
does
not
distinguish
parker
from
lockett,
i
think
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam
do
you
think
it
is
very
common
to
say
that
the
ohio
legislature
is
here
creating
the
problems
we
have
here
and
misunderstood
the
court’s
holding
an
affirming.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
argued
firmly
--
they
you
argued
firmly,
did
you
not?
