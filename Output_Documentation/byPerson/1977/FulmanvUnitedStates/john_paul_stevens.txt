justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levenson,
on
that
point,
supposing
the
corporation
has
earnings
and
profits
that
exceeded
the
adjusted
spaces
of
the
dividend
that
are
not
as
great
as
the
market
value
of
the
dividend,
would
the
dividend
be
permissible
under
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
other
way
around.
the
fair
market
value
exceeds
the
earnings
and
profits,
but
the
earnings
and
profits
exceed
the
adjusted
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
taxable
as
a
dividend?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
whole,
under
your
theory
the
whole
market
value
is
taxable
under
either
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
my
example.
assume
the
earnings
and
profits
are
sufficient
to
exceed
the
market
value,
what
kind
of
an
accounting
adjustment
does
the
corporation
make
on
its
books
to
keep
the
balance
sheet,
the
assets
and
liabilities
equal
when
they
distribute
more
then
the
book
value
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
what
happens
on
the
corporate
books
to
the
difference
between
the
adjusted
basis
and
the
market
value
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
get
a
deduction
as
i
understand
you
for
the
full
market
value
of
the
asset?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
assuming
the
earnings
and
profits
are
greater?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
asset
and
liability
ratio
may
change
by
the
difference
between
adjusted
basis
and
market
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
have
to
be
really
a
difference
in
tax
accounting
and
normal
accounting
to
carry
out
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levenson
that
kind
of
fundamental
proposition,
why
is
that
so,
in
the
normal
case
the
tax
impact
of
a
dividend
is
zero
with
respect
to
the
corporation,
but
it
creates
a
tax
obligations
on
behalf
of
the
party
receiving
the
dividend?
why
is
there
this
need
for
dissimilarity
that
is
crucial
to
your
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levenson,
on
your
loophole
argument,
even
under
the
governmentâ€™s
view
could
not
tax
the
corporation
that
has
stock
that
has
a
market
value
of
less
than
its
basis.
simply
sell
the
stock
and
take
the
loss
and
then
distribute
the
money,
would
it
not
all
come
out
the
same?
am
i
missing
something
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
and
it
took
the
tax
loss
because
it
is
selling
for
less
than
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
also
reduce
its
income
by
the
loss
on
the
stock?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh!
because
the
capital
loss
would
not
be
100
cents
on
the
dollar?
