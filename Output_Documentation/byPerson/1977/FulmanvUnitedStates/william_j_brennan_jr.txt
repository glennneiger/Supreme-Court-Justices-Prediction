in
76-1137,
fulman,
a
personal
holding
company
distributed
stock
of
another
company
to
it's
shareholders
as
a
deficiency
dividend.
the
stock
had
a
fair
market
value
of
$32,525
but
on
it's
books
and
adjusted
basis
was
only
$18,725.
now
there
is
a
treasury
regulation
that
provides
that
a
personal
holding
company
in
these
circumstances
is
entitled
to
a
dividend
paid
deduction
only
in
the
amount
of
the
stocks
adjusted
basis,
that
is
in
this
case
$18,725
and
this
case
involves
an
attack
on
the
validity
of
that
regulation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
sustained
the
validity
of
the
regulation
but
that
decision
is
in
conflict
with
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
which
held
that
the
regulation
was
invalid
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
we
conclude
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
that
the
regulation
is
valid
and
affirm
it's
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
concurring
in
part
with
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
dissents
and
has
a
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
