unknown
speaker
but
this
rule
has
always
been
the
same
too,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
rule
before
the
54
code
was
the
same?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
work
the
same
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
came
before
the
54
code
as
it
is
known?
unknown
speaker
and
there
the
revenue,
you
should
have
a
greater
deduction
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
in
view
what
you
say,
why
do
you
suppose
the
government
is
taking
a
position
it
is
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
312
should
be
read
as
316,
should
not
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
directly
at
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there
remained
undistributed
personal
holding
company
income
after
this
stock
was
paid
out
as
a
dividend?
unknown
speaker
within
them
--
as
i
phrase,
is
defined
in
the
law?
unknown
speaker
as
shareholders
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
enhancement
of
the
property
had
never
been
reflected
on
the
corporate
books
as
income?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
–
and
the
income
that
has
been
made
and
has
been
reflected
on
the
corporate
books
will
not
be
taxed,
will
not
be
distributed
if
you
get
this
deduction
at
the
market
value?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
earnings
that
are
then
accumulated
on
the
books
and
reflected
on
the
books
remain
in
the
company?
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
been
earned?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
subject
to
the
ordinary
corporate
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
they
remain
in
the
company
undistributed?
unknown
speaker
the
other
way
of
looking
at
it
would
be
had
those
earnings
been
paid
off,
then
this
capital
gain
would
have
remained
in
the
company
undistributed?
unknown
speaker
without
recognition
of
gain
or
loss?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
ivan
allen
case
had
to
do
with
your
case,
does
it
help
you
or
hurt
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levenson
may
i
ask
you
is
there
any
special
reason
for
making
this
distribution
in
property
rather
than
cash?
unknown
speaker
and
it
kept
cash
in
the
company?
unknown
speaker
other
assets?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
in
the
company?
unknown
speaker
but
you
know
that
the
appreciation
in
this
property
has
not
been
reflected
in
that
historical
record?
unknown
speaker
it
is
prior
to
54
congress
had
made
a
judgment
that
in
circumstances
like
this,
on
these
facts
the
deduction
would
be
at
the
book
value?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
and
you
suggest
that
there
is
evidence
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
into
the
54
code?
unknown
speaker
was
this
any
corporate
distributee
or
an
affiliated
corporation?
unknown
speaker
any
corporate
distributee?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
basis
should
be
taken
as
the
value
of
the
distribution
whether
the
basis
is
higher
or
lower
than
the
present
market
value?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
--
is
there
any
fiscal
advantage
to
the
government
in
the
position
you
are
taking?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
just
up
here
upholding
regulation
as
a
matter
of
law
and
legal
duty?
unknown
speaker
right,
both
briefs
speak
intent
of
the
personal
holding
company
tax
and
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
is
it
necessary
to
analysis
of
this
problem
to
consider
them
together
or
would
it
not
be
easier
to
isolate
this
tax,
so
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
whether
or
not
they
remained
undistributed
personal
holding
company
income
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
after
this
distribution,
that
is
the
precise
question?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
whether
he
is
rather
complicated
than
petitions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
under
none
other?
unknown
speaker
for
different
tax
there
would
be
different
problems,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
personal
holding
company
tax?
unknown
speaker
we
are
dealing
here
with
what
is
in
effect
a
confiscatory
tax
upon
a
corporation
defined
as
a
personal
holding
company
tax,
that
if
a
personal
holding
company,
unless
the
corporation
makes
distributions
to
its
shareholders
and
we
all
know
what
the
purpose
of
it
was
back
in
1934,
was
to
get
away
from
incorporated
yachts
and
race
horses
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
did
change
in
54,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
for
this
case,
but
--
unknown
speaker
well,
a
quite
different
rule--
unknown
speaker
now,
did
they
--
in
publishing
their
regulation,
apparently
the
government
divined
that
this
was
the
congressional
will
or
just
that
this
sort
of
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
permissible?
unknown
speaker
but
–
well,
there
is
a
difference
in
there
as
well
as
this
was
specifically
was
congressional
intent,
was
the
congressional
intent
or
whether
congress
intended
to
give
an
area
of
discretion
in
drafting
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
what
the
regulation
indicates?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
--
what
in
the
legislative
history
do
you
submit
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
rule
a
little
bit
as
you
say?
unknown
speaker
even
where
it
depreciates?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
although
it
reflects
an
investment
of
income
at
the
amount
that
the
property
costs?
unknown
speaker
does
the
tax
payer
encompass
any
other
avoidance
by
distributing
in
property
rather
than
cash,
then
the
capital
gains
tax
that
you
concede
that
you
would?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
one
where
he
wins
or
not
on
the
valuation
question?
unknown
speaker
unless
he
also
avoids
personal
holding
company
income,
does
he
not,
he
avoids
distributing
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
--
the
whole
personal
holding
company,
all
of
the
provisions
are
punitive
in
a
sense
and
they
take
away
any
incentive
to
incorporate
your
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
sense
at
least
there
were
punitive
provisions?
unknown
speaker
and
remove
any
incentive
whatsoever
really
to
incorporate
--?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
the
bearing
of
the
ivan
allen
case
--
unknown
speaker
both
you
and
your
brother
on
the
other
side
of
the
table,
at
the
other
table,
more
or
less
rely
on
ivan
allen,
each
of
you
thinks
it
gives
you
at
least
some
support?
unknown
speaker
and
how
and
why?
unknown
speaker
unrealized?
unknown
speaker
it
would
permit
a
deduction
for
unrealized?
unknown
speaker
not
realized?
unknown
speaker
but
ivan
allen
does
stand
to
the
proposition
that
in
computing
accumulated
earnings
and
profits,
the
tax
payer
must
take
into
account
the
unrealized
appreciation
of
the
security
--
unknown
speaker
must
be
taken
into
account?
unknown
speaker
well,
must
be
i
think?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
--
unknown
speaker
well,
basically
unless
you
got
into
inter-corporate
distributions,
it
did
not
make
any
difference,
did
it,
for
an
ordinary
corporation
because
it
was
not
a
corporation
prior
to
the
penalty
on
distributed
earnings?
could
declared
dividends
out
of
its
earnings
and
profits
in
any
amount
in
the
discretion
of
the
board
of
directors?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
clear
that
the
value
to
the
shareholders
was
the
fair
market
of
what
was
distributed,
it
is
always
been
clear,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
to
the
shareholders,
to
the
shareholders
it
is
a
fair
market
value
of
what
is
distributed
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
income?
unknown
speaker
my
point
is
that
before
1936,
it
did
not
make
any
difference.
how
could
it
arise
from
the
--
to
the
corporation
as
a
tax
payer?
unknown
speaker
did
not
make
–
it
could
not
--
the
issue
could
not
arise
vis-a-via
the
corporation's
tax
returns,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
