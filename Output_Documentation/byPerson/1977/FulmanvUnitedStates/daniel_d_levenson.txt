mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
focuses
on
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
dealing
with
personal
holding
companies
and
corporations
which
unnecessarily
accumulate
income.
these
special
provisions
have
been
placed
in
the
code
to
deal
with
the
shareholders
of
those
companies
who
wish
to
accumulate
income
in
a
corporation.
such
accumulation
would
thereby
shield
the
corporate
profits
from
the
second
tax
at
the
high
tax
rates
imposed
upon
the
recipients
of
dividends.
until
1921,
congress
dealt
with
these
shareholders
directly
by
taxing
them
on
their
pro
rata
share
of
corporate
earnings,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
those
earnings
were
distributed
to
them.
however,
after
this
court’s
decision
in
1921,
in
the
case
of
eisner
v.
macomber,
doubts
arose
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
direct
taxing
scheme.
therefore,
congress
provided
an
alternative
method.
it
allowed
the
shareholders
to
determine
if
they
wish
to
account
for
their
corporate
profits
and
their
incomes
directly
whether
or
not
distributed,
but
failing
that,
congress
created
an
incentive
to
encourage
corporations
which
had
been
determined
to
be
unnecessarily
accumulating
their
income
to
actually
make
distributions
of
the
unneeded
income
to
their
shareholders
which
could
then
be
taxed
at
the
individual
rates.
congress
did
this
by
imposing
what
it
thought
to
be
a
virtually
confiscatory
tax
on
the
undistributed
income
of
these
corporations
and
then
by
providing
a
deduction
for
dividends
distributed
to
shareholders
which
directly
reduces
the
income
subject
to
the
additional
tax.
it
is
this
dividends
paid
deduction
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
specifically,
the
question
involves
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
the
deduction
when
a
corporation
distributes
a
dividend
consisting
of
property
rather
than
cash.
the
government
maintains
that
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
at
the
date
of
distribution
should
be
totally
disregarded,
even
though
the
shareholder
who
receives
the
property
is
taxed
in
full
on
that
value.
the
government
has
done
this
by
promulgating
treas.
reg.
1.562-1
(a),
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case,
which
regulation
states
that
when
property
is
distributed
by
a
corporation,
the
dividends
paid
deduction
shall
equal
the
properties
adjusted
basis,
not
its
fair
market
value.
we
maintain
that
this
regulation
as
it
pertains
to
this
case
is
inconsistent
with
the
internal
revenue
code,
is
arbitrary,
totally
without
statutory
or
legislative
support
and
leads
to
irrational
results.
for
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
regulation
should
be
declared
to
be
invalid.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
in
1958,
the
final
regulation,
your
honor.
the
basic
thrust
of
both
the
personal
holding
company
and
accumulator
earning
taxes
has
always
been
the
same
to
force
distributions
from
the
business
to
be
taxed
again
in
the
hands
of
the
shareholders
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
no,
it
has
not
it
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
the
rule
prior
to
the
1954
code
was
to
allow
a
deduction
for
the
lesser
of
the
adjusted
basis
or
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
distributed.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
in
this
particular
case,
the
regulation,
the
law
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes,
but
not
in
general.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
what
we
will
elaborate
on
further
in
our
argument,
that
in
fact
the
government’s
rule
does
not
create
more
tax,
does
not
create
more
equity,
but
in
fact
we
will
demonstrate
that
it
creates
a
loophole
through
which
corporations
and
shareholders
who
are
the
owners
of
those
corporations
with
highly
depreciated
property
can
create
a
tax
loss
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
basis
for
our
argument.
our
argument
will
be
based
upon
the
meaning
of
the
code
as
we
have
divined
it
from
the
committee
reports,
not
having
to
do
with
the
equity
or
inequity
of
any
particular
rule.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
we
have
fought
long
and
hard
on
that
your
honor
and
we
think
without
any
way
to
prove
its
correctness
that
the
government
regulation,
writing
the
treasury
in
1956
when
these
regulations
were
proposed,
saw
the
typographical
error
in
the
committee
reports
dealing
with
section
562.
that
typographical
error
has
been
referred
to
in
our
briefs
and
in
particular
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
judge
in
this
case.
the
typographical
error
refers
in
a
senate
report
to
section
312.
that
was
the
original
section
in
the
house
bill
that
dealt
with
“definition”
of
a
dividend.
when
the
senate
did
its
work
on
the
code,
it
changed
the
numbering,
changing
the
numbering
of
that
particular
section
dealing
with
the
dividend
from
312
to
316.
somehow
the
reference
to
312
remained
in
the
report.
now,
what
we
have
also
done
is
to
track
down
in
the
actual
senate
amendments
which
can
be
found
in
the
congressional
record,
the
technical
wording
of
the
amendment
which
said
regarding
section
562
change
all
references
316
to
312.
so
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
i
do
not
know
the
reason.
i
can
only
guess
that
someone
was
confused
by
the
section
312
reference,
saw
the
provisions
of
section
312,
which
talks
about
the
reduction
of
earnings
and
profits
only
by
adjusted
basis
and
wrote
the
regulation
accordingly.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
in
the
committee
reports
it
should
be
read
as
316
we
maintain,
yes.
to
relieve
the
corporation
of
a
penalty
tax
by
providing
a
dividends
paid
deduction
to
the
same
extent
that
a
shareholder
receives
taxable
income
is
not
only
symmetrical,
but
also
accurately
reflects
the
basic
statutory
purposes
of
these
laws
in
a
specific
statutory
relationships
of
the
1954
code.
if
the
deduction
is
greater
then
the
amount
taxed
to
the
shareholder
then
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
distribute
the
full
amount
intended
to
be
distributed
by
congress.
a
deduction
for
less
then
the
amount
taxed
to
the
shareholder
would
require
corporations
to
distribute
property
with
a
value
in
excess
of
the
amount
subject
to
tax.
we
submit
that
neither
result
is
consistent
with
congressional
purpose.
now,
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
1954
code
that
congress
envisioned
a
coherent,
integrated
system
of
corporate
shareholder
taxation.
as
part
of
this
scheme,
it
refined
the
definition
of
the
term
dividend
to
be
a
very
precise
term
of
art.
it
might
be
useful
to
think
of
a
dividend
as
a
molecule,
having
several
atomic
components,
each
of
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
character
of
the
final
product,
namely
a
dividend.
first
there
has
to
be
a
distribution.
that
distribution
must
be
a
distribution
covered
by
section
301
of
the
code.
then
there
must
be
--
that
distribution
must
be
of
property
as
that
term
is
defined
in
section
317
a
of
the
code.
the
amount
of
the
distribution
must
be
determined
as
set
forth
in
section
301
(b).
finally
the
corporation
must
have
earnings
and
profits
calculated
as
indicated
in
section
312.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
it
would
be
fully,
if
the
earnings
and
profits
exceed
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
then
that
portion
of
the
appreciation
on
the
property
arising
from
the
adjusted
basis
level
to
the
earnings
and
profits
level
that
amount
will
be
taxable
as
a
dividend
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
excess
of
appreciation.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
to
the
shareholder.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
only
to
the
extent
of
earnings
and
profits
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
this
point
in
fact
is
recognized
by
the
government
in
its
regulations
under
sections
316
and
312,
which
are
foot
noted
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief
and
from
those
regulations
you
can
see
the
inter-relationship
of
these
various
terms
in
both
of
those
two
code
sections
and
you
see
how
the
relationship
of
earnings
and
profits,
fair
market
value
and
adjusted
basis
relate
to
each
other
in
determining
the
tax
consequences
to
the
shareholder.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
if
the
earnings
and
profits
exceed
the
market
value,
then
the
earnings
and
profits
account
would
be
adjusted
only
for
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property
distributed.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
there
would
be
no
adjustment
on
the
accounting
records
of
the
corporation
because
the
appreciation
on
the
property
was
never
reflected
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
corporation
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
only
to
the
extent
of
the
earnings
and
profits,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
that
is
correct.
they
get
a
deduction
for
this
special
tax.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
for
the
purpose
of
the
normal
taxation
of
the
corporation
and
the
calculation
of
its
earnings
and
profits
account,
the
result
would
be
as
i
indicated,
only
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property
would
be
reflected
as
a
diminishment
of
the
earnings
and
profits.
for
this
special
tax
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
normal
corporate
accounting,
that
is
the
balance
sheet
that
you
might
read
at
the
end
of
the
year,
it
has
no
effect.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
for
the
purpose
of
the
special
tax,
it
certainly
would
be.
our
point
is
that
if
it
is
not
a
distribution
covered
by
section
301,
it
cannot
be
a
dividend.
if
there
are
not
any
earnings
and
profits,
it
cannot
be
a
dividend.
if
the
distribution
is
not
of
property,
it
cannot
be
dividend.
every
requirement
has
to
be
met.
each
of
the
component
sections
can
only
be
understood
by
reference
to
the
others.
it
was
this
unitary
integrated
concept
that
congress
referred
to
in
section
562,
when
it
stated
that
for
the
purpose
of
a
dividends
paid
deduction,
the
rules
of
section
316
encompassing
all
of
these
concepts
of
that
go
to
make
up
a
dividend,
that
the
rules
of
section
316
would
be
used
to
determine
what
is
a
dividend,
specifically
for
the
purposes
of
defining
what
would
be
included
as
a
dividend
paid
deduction.
now,
this
scheme
of
statutory
inter-relationships
is
made
even
clearer
by
reference
to
the
statutory
history
of
316
in
1954
code,
which
is
discussed
in
part
2
of
our
main
brief.
the
government
has
not
yet
replied
to
the
arguments
contained
in
section
2
of
our
brief,
possibly
we
will
hear
it
on
reply.
also
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
regulations
promulgated
under
section
316
and
312
further
indicate
the
integrated
nature
of
these
code
sections.
there
is
no
reason
indicated
in
the
internal
revenue
code
or
in
the
committee
reports
why
the
valuation
of
a
dividend
for
the
purposes
of
the
personal
holding
company
or
accumulated
earning
taxes
should
be
different
from
the
normal
rules
applicable
to
corporate
distributions
quite
to
the
contrary,
instead
of
annunciating
a
separate
rule,
as
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
section
562
refers
to
section
316
as
stating
the
basic
criterion
of
whether
or
not
a
distribution
qualifies
for
the
dividends
paid
deduction.
the
adjusted
basis
rule
which
is
the
rule
urged
by
the
government
in
its
treasury
regulation
is
completely
irrational.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
adjusted
basis
of
property
bears
no
consistent
relation
to
a
corporation’s
earnings
or
realized
investment
income.
not
all
assets
purchased
by
the
corporation
or
owned
by
the
corporation
are
purchased
by
the
corporation.
assets
may
be
acquired
by
contribution
to
capital.
they
may
be
acquired
by
tax
free
reorganization
or
in
a
myriad
of
other
ways.
for
example,
the
basis
is
often
reduced
each
year
of
depreciable
property
by
that
bookkeeping
adjustment
which
we
know
is
depreciation.
the
rate
and
method
of
depreciation,
however,
can
often
be
elected
by
the
tax
payer
within
certain
parameters
set
out
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
we
suggest
your
honor
that
the
way
to
escape
the
artificiality
of
this
process
is
to
allow
a
dividends
paid
deduction
for
the
value
of
the
property
which
in
fact
is
distributed,
whether
that
property
is
marketable,
whether
that
property
is
not
marketable.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
of
course
he
may
and
we
are
suggesting
that
he
be
given
the
opportunity
to
determine
which
property
to
distribute
from
a
corporation
based
upon
only
the
criterion
that
the
property
have
the
value
necessary
to
carry
out
the
equivalent
of
the
corporations
improperly
accumulated
income,
be
it
a
personal
holding
company
or
a
corporation
subject
to
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
we
say
that
property
with
the
same
market
value,
but
with
vastly
different
adjusted
basis
can
be
distributed
by
two
different
corporations.
the
tax
impact
on
the
corporation
should
not
be
dissimilar
when
the
tax
impact
on
the
shareholders
is
the
same.
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
our
argument,
the
government's
rule
creates
a
significant
loophole.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
because
of
the
nature
of
the
special
tax
your
honor.
the
tax
as
we
indicated
was
enacted
first
in
the
1913
revenue
act
and
consistently
thereafter
to
force
corporations
to
distribute
out
income
to
the
shareholders.
now,
after
1921,
the
vehicle
used
were
these
taxes
which
were
designed
to
impose
a
penalty
of
such
an
amount
as
to
force
the
corporations
or
induce
the
corporations
to
distribute
the
money
out
by
allowing
a
dividends
paid
deduction.
it
is
that
incentive
that
is
at
work
here
that
we
wish
to
have
the
market
value
of
the
property
be
the
measure
of
the
dividend
paid
in
property.
we
feel
that
that
satisfies
the
statutory
and
historical
philosophy
behind
these
taxes.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
in
this
case
what
actually
happened
as
shown
in
the
appendix
is
that
the
stock
holders
of
our
client
received
marketable
securities
of
a
value
in
access
of
their
cost
to
the
corporation,
paid
the
normal
income
tax,
allocable
to
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
as
shareholders
based
upon
the
value
of
the
property
when
it
was
distributed.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
it
had
never
been
reflected
on
the
corporate
books
as
income.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
the
second
part
of
your
statement
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
is
the
way
that
congress
intended
to
look
at
these
taxes.
congress
was
intending
not
to
--
was
intending
to
tax
the
shareholders
on
an
amount
equal
to
the
amount
which
the
internal
revenue
service
determined
was
improperly
accumulated.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
that
amount
is
set
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
our
point
is
that
the
earnings
reflected
on
the
books
are
reflected
only
on
the
books,
that
is
they
are
a
bookkeeping
entry.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
they
have
been
earned,
but
they
have
been
invested
in
other
assets
your
honor.
they
have
been
invested
in
real
estate,
in
stocks,
in
equipment,
machinery
whatever
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes,
they
are.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
but
they
–
although
they
remain
the
company
undistributed,
they
nevertheless
are
available
to
be
distributed
upon
a
subsequent
distribution.
there
has
been
no
overall
tax
avoidance
by
the
shareholders
by
giving
effect,
if
you
give
effect
to
the
rule
for
which
we
contend.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
the
capital
gain
was
never
intended
to
be
taxed
by
the
congress.
in
fact,
section
311
of
the
internal
revenue
code
specifically
states
that
property
may
be
distributed
by
a
corporation,
the
general
rule
is
that
the
property
may
be
distributed
without
the
corporation,
without
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
and
that
was
a
valued
judgment
made
by
congress
in
1954
following
a
decision
of
this
court
i
believe
in
the
general
utilities
case
in
the
40’s
or
30’s,
i
am
not
sure
which.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
we
believe
that
the
ivan
allen
case
helps
us
your
honor
because
the
majority
of
this
court
in
that
case
recognized
that
the
value
of
the
marketable
securities
held
by
ivan
allen
company
were
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
income
had
been
accumulated
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business.
we
believe
that
the
recognition
of
the
fair
market
value
in
ivan
allen
for
purposes
of
computing
what
should
be
taxed
that
that
should
also
apply
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin
in
determining
the
value
of
the
dividends
being
paid
out
by
the
corporation.
we
find
a
symmetry
in
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
in
that
case
and
our
position
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
loophole
created
by
the
government's
rule
which
can
best
be
recognized
by
referring
to
the
general
securities
case
which
we
cited
in
our
main
brief.
that
being
a
case
in
1930’s
where
property
with
a
very
high
basis
was
just
and
a
low
value
was
distributed,
the
court
prior
to
the
1936
act,
this
is
the
distribution
occurred
prior
to
36
act,
the
court
refused
to
give
a
credit
for
the
basis
of
the
property
and
rule
that
the
fair
market
value
was
the
basis
for
the
credit
to
be
given
to
the
court,
to
the
distributing
corporation.
the
adjusted
basis
rule
argued
for
by
the
government
has
never
appeared
in
any
statute
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
is
quite
different
from
the
rule
that
was
in
existence
prior
to
1939.
i
might
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
explanation
in
the
case
of
c.
blake
mcdowell,
of
the
concurring
judge,
it
is
a
tax
court
case,
judge
gogh
(ph)
reported
that
27
(d)
came
into
the
law
in
order
to
plug
a
loophole
involved
--
which
involved
inter-corporate
distributions
of
property,
that
was
the
reason
why
27
(d)
--
[recess]
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
the
reason
was
your
honor
that
the
value
of
the
property
was
sufficient
to
take
out
all
of
the
personal
holding
company
income
determined
by
the
government.
the
failure
to
sell
the
property
of
course
saved
the
corporation
the
capital
gains
tax
that
would
otherwise
they
have
had
to
pay.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes,
it
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
it
kept
other
assets
in
the
company,
but
that
would
have
been
the
case
if
these
assets
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
comments
that
you
made
concerning
earnings
a
short
while
ago,
questions.
a
distribution
can
never
be
traced
to
a
specific
earnings
account.
an
earnings
account
in
that
nature
just
does
not
exist.
we
discussed
that
point
in
our
reply
brief
and
would
like
to
again
call
your
attention
to
the
point
that
we
made
in
footnote
1
on
that
issue.
earnings
and
profits
are
not
a
separate
bank
account,
they
are
not
a
separate
piece
of
property
than
us,
nor
a
separate
anything.
they
are
historical
record
of
corporate
success
or
failure.
any
distribution
stuck
to
shareholders
is,
the
taxation
of
any
distribution
to
shareholders
is
based
upon
that
historical
record,
that
is
what
earnings
and
profits
are.
whether
the
money
that
or
property
which
is
actually
distributed
came
originally
from
earnings
or
from
stock
subscriptions
or
from
property
acquired
in
a
tax
free
re-organization,
that
is
completely
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
congress
made
the
valued
judgment
in
section
311
of
the
code
not
to
tax
appreciation
on
property
distributed
by
corporations.
so
that
it
is
not,
it
is
not
a
tax
avoidance
maneuver
that
is
--
was
engaged
in
by
this
tax
payer
in
making
such
a
distribution.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
to
fully
understand
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intended
in
the
54
code,
but
to
answer
your
comment
more
specifically,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
the
reason
why
27
(d)
was
incorporated
into
the
internal
revenue
code
prior
to
that
time
because
that
has
obviously
given
everyone
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
well,
it
came
into
effect
in
1936,
carried
over
in
the
39
code
which
was
merely
a
recodification
of
all
its
existing
internal
revenue
loss
at
the
time.
it
did
not
involve
a
value
judgment
in
compiling
the
39
code
which
sections
were
good
and
which
were
bad
as
did
the
54
code.
there
is
a
provision,
there
was
a
provision
in
the
law
which
allowed
corporations
to
distribute
property
to
another
corporation.
the
recipient
corporation
would
receive
that
property
as
a
dividend,
take
it
into
account,
take
as
its
basis
the
market
value
on
the
date
of
distribution,
pay
no
tax
upon
that
inter-corporate
dividend
distribution
because
of
an
inter-corporate
dividends
received
credit,
sell
the
appreciated
property,
thereby
taking,
having
no
tax
imposed
upon
all
of
the
gain.
what
congress
chose
to
do
in
1936
in
the
context
of
the
undistributed
profits
tax
that
was
enacted
in
that
year
was
to
restrict
the
dividends
paid
deduction
to
the
lower
of
the
adjusted
basis
or
value.
now,
in
the
54
code
what
congress
did
to
achieve
exactly
the
same
result
was
to
distinguish
between
the
tax
effects
to
a
corporate
and
a
non-corporate
distributee
upon
receipt
of
a
dividend
from
another
corporation.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
any
corporate
distributee.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes
sir.
we
would
like
to
conclude
that
the
rule
advocated
by
the
government
is
neither
reasonable
nor
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
it
is
not
justified
by
the
provisions
of
the
code.
it
is
not
justified
by
resort
to
legislative
history.
in
short,
the
regulation
in
question
we
believe
represents
an
arbitrary
extension
of
administrative
authority
and
should
be
struck
down
as
an
attempt
to
legislate
by
regulation.
the
statutory
direction
is
that
for
all
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
dividend
is
defined
by
section
316
and
its
component
parts,
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
a
comment
was
made
that,
a
question
was
asked
rather
whether
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
treasury
an
area
of
discretion
in
promulgating
regulations
under
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
plan
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
internal
revenue
code
in
particular
when
congress
intents
to
give
broad
discretionary
power
to
the
treasury,
it
specifically
indicates
such
as
in
the
consolidated
return
regulations,
allocation
of
income
and
deductions
between
tax
payers
and
other
broad
areas
where
congress
has
stated
its
policy
and
says
to
treasury
you
fill
it
in.
those
are
known
as
legislative
regulations
and
are
usually
given
great
weight
by
the
courts.
my
brother
says
that
we,
tax
payer’s
counsel
agree
that
nothing
in
the
code
dictates
how
a
dividend
in
property
is
to
be
valued
at
the
corporate
level.
that
is
not
correct.
we
do
not
agree
that
the
code
is
silent
on
that.
in
fact,
we
state
that
the
code
indicates
the
unitary
integrated
concept
about
which
we
referred
and
that
this
is
the
same
method
of
evaluation
valuing
a
dividend
at
the
corporate
level
as
at
the
shareholder
level.
the
regulation
does
not
require
that
we
prove
that
the
property
has
been
purchased
with
personal
holding
company
income.
the
corporation
can
distribute
property
that
has
been
acquired
in
any
manner.
the
“adjusted
basis”
rule
does
not
necessarily
reflect
personal
holding
company
income,
that
is
the
adjusted
basis
of
property.
for
example,
if
i
had
ten
central
stock
of
high
basis
and
low
value
and
had
a
personal
holding
company,
i
could,
under
the
government’s
rule
contribute
that
stock
to
the
corporation,
a
non-taxable
event,
the
following
year
or
even
may
be
the
same
year
have
that
corporation
distribute
out
that
high
basis
property
and
take
away
the
personal
holding
company
tax
potential.
and
that
is
the
way
that
adjusted
basis
can
be
utilized
to
defeat
the
intention
of
congress
and
what
should
be
the
intention
of
the
treasury.
a
comment
was
made
that
prior
to
1936
there
was
no
valuation
rule.
we
believe
that
prior
to
1936
the
courts
believed
that
the
value
of
the
dividend
was
to
be
the
value
of
the
property
distributed
and
it
was
only
in
the
context
of
the
undistributed
profits
tax
in
1936
that
the
rule
was
changed.
that
it
was
not
changed
because
congress
looked
and
thought
hard
on
this
issue,
but
rather
it
was
changed
to
accomplish
the
closing
of
the
loophole
that
i
referred
to
in
the
main
portion
of
my
argument.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
but
then
the
nature
of
the
undistributed
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
where
the
adjusted,
oh!
excuse
me,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
that
is
correct,
but
the
nature
of
the
undistributed
profits
tax
in
1936
was
a
completely
different
animal
than
either
of
the
normal
income
tax
or
the
penalty
taxes.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes,
your
honor,
you
are
correct.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
not
under
the
statutes
existing
prior
to
1936.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
no,
if
the
corporation
distributed
the
residue
left
after
sale
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
it
might
take
the
tax
loss
against
its
normal
corporate
income
tax,
but
it
will
not
thereby
be
able
to
take
out
all
of
the
accumulated
taxable
income
or
personal
holding
company
income
under
the
government’s
rule
because
it
will
be
distributing
cash,
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
--
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
not
under
the
way,
the
different
ways
that
capital
gains
and
ordinary
income
as
they
--.
mr.
daniel
d.
levenson
it
would
not
be
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
your
honor.
