mr.
michael
l.
paup
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
section
1.562-1
(a)
of
the
regulations
is
valid.
these
regulations
of
course
provide
that
a
personal
holding
companies,
dividends
paid
deduction
with
respect
to
a
distribution
in
kind
should
be
determined
by
the
corporation's
adjusted
basis,
generally
it
is
investment
in
the
property
distributed.
we
submit
that
the
first
circuit
below
was
entirely
correct
in
holding
that
the
regulations
we
are
consistent
with
the
objectives
and
terms
of
the
revenue
act
and
were
indeed
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
to
begin
with,
this
court
has
often
held
that
great
difference
should
be
accorded
to
interpretations
given
a
statute
by
the
officers
charged
with
its
administration.
indeed
this
court
has
held
that
treasury
regulations
must
be
sustained
unless
plainly
inconsistent
--
unless
unreasonable
and
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
revenue
statutes.
the
present
regulations
cannot
be
held
deficient
under
those
standards.
in
our
view
the
whole
of
petitioners
argument
that
these
regulations
are
invalid
is
premised
on
an
unhistorical
and
over
simplified
view
of
the
personal
holding
company
and
accumulated
earnings
taxes.
essentially,
petitioner's
argument
begins
with
a
premise
that
personal
holding
company
and
accumulated
earnings
taxes
were
designed
to
discourage
the
use
of
corporate
vehicles
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
progressive
tax
applicable
to
shareholders.
it
then
notes
that
individual
shareholders
are
taxable
upon
the
full
fair
market
value
of
the
property
they
received
from
corporations
as
a
distribution
in
kind.
the
argument
then
jumps
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
measure
appropriate
for
determining
the
corporate
dividends
paid
deduction
is
the
measure
used
to
determine
the
amount
includable
in
shareholder
income.
that
argument
cannot
be
squared
with
history.
historically
the
personal
holding
company
tax
and
the
dividend
paid
deduction
first
came
into
the
code
in
1934.
at
that
time,
the
congress
did
not
define
specifically
the
effect
a
distribution
of
property
in
kind
would
have
with
respect
to
the
corporations
dividend
paid
deduction.
the
1936
act,
however,
soon
filled
that
gap.
in
1936,
the
congress
passed
section
27
(c),
a
section
later
recodified
as
section
27
(d)
of
the
39
code
and
in
that
section
it
explicitly
provided
that
a
corporation's
dividend
paid
deduction
with
respect
to
a
dividend
in
kind
should
be
determined
by
the
lesser
of
basis
or
fair
market
value.
that
rule
enacted
by
congress
in
1936
then
would
provide
exactly
the
same
result
as
the
rule
under
the
regulations
would
effect
with
respect
to
this
tax
payer.
as
part
of
the
same
revenue
act,
the
revenue
act
of
1936,
congress
also
defined
exactly
the
effect
a
distribution
in
kind
would
have
upon
individual
shareholders,
shareholder
recipients.
in
section
115
(j)
of
the
36
act,
congress
explicitly
provided
that
shareholder
recipients
of
distributions
in
kind
should
include
those
distributions
in
their
income
to
the
full
extent
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
received.
in
the
face
of
this
history,
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
conceive
how
petitioners
can
now
argue
that
the
purpose
of
the
personal
holding
company
tax
would
be
fully
served
by
a
rule
that
keys
corporate
dividends
paid
deductions
to
the
amount
includable
in
shareholder
income.
obviously,
when
congress
faced
the
question
in
1936,
it
concluded
that
such
a
rule
would
not
fully
serve
the
purpose
of
the
personal
holding
company
to
tax,
specifically,
these
taxes,
the
personal
holding
company
tax
and
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
attached
an
undistributed
or
accumulated
taxable
income.
those
income
items
specifically
encompass
only
fully
realized
income
items,
income
items
realized
and
recognized
at
the
corporate
level.
the
rule
tax
payer
advocates
here
would
permit
a
deduction
with
respect
to
those
realized,
fully
recognized
income
items
with
respect
to
income
items
that
have
never
been
realized
at
a
corporate
level.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
what
the
regulation
provides,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
clearly
the
law
applicable
under
the
1936
act
would
generate
more
revenues
particularly
with
respect
to
distributions
of
property
that
it
depreciated
in
value
while
held
by
the
corporation
so
it
is
fiscally
disadvantageous,
but
we
think
it
is
consistent.
the
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
no.
i
think
it
is
logically
consistent
with
the
focus
of
the
tax,
it
is
in
accord
with
congressional
intent,
it
is
consistent
with
the
treatment
of
distributions
at
the
corporate
level
for
various
other
tax
purposes
as
well.
it
is
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
the
precise
question
here
involved,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
and
i
think
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
true.
that
is
precise
question
here
involved,
but
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
know
that
the
dividend
paid
deduction
also
applies
to
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
and
equally
had
this
been
an
accumulated
earnings
tax
problem,
the
corporation
here
faced
accumulated
earnings
would
have
remained
accumulated
at
the
corporate
level.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
oh!
the
result
is
same
though
in
either
case,
your
honor
.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
and
pocketbooks
yes
your
honor.
in
our
view,
the
only
thing,
the
only
hope
tax
payers
have
of
winning
this
case
is
to
convince
the
court
that
somehow
the
thrust
of
the
personal
holding
company
tax
changed
drastically
in
1954.
we
do
not
think
that
anything
they
have
cited
either
in
brief
or
in
oral
argument
indicate
such
a
drastic
shift
in
the
focus
or
the
intent
of
the
tax.
quite
clearly
nothing
in
the
literal
statutory
language
of
the
1954
code
evidences
an
intention
to
shift
the
focus
of
the
corporate
dividend
paid
deduction
away
from
the
effect
that
distribution
has
on
the
corporation
to
the
effect
that
distribution
has
upon
shareholder
income.
indeed
such
a
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
the
regulation
provided
a
slightly
different
rule
from
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
not
for
this
case,
no.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
quite
different
rule
for
distributions
with
respect
to
property
that
it
depreciated.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
specifically
i
think
they
divined
that
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
permissible
and
i
think
further
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
i
think
basically,
the
shift
in
the
regulation
in
our
view
is
that
the
legislature
history
underlying
the
54
code
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
carry
over
section
27
(d).
now,
there
are
certain
counter
indications.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
no
your
honor,
these
--
there
are
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
specifically,
in
discussing
the
dividend
paid
deduction,
the
senate
report
makes
a
reference
to
section
3
(12)
of
the
code.
now,
we
do
not
give
that
reference
to
section
3
(12)
of
the
code
as
a
mere
typographical
error.
there
are
certain
ambiguities
in
the
legislative
history
will
grant.
section
3
(12)
of
the
code
of
course
provides
for
an
adjustment
at
the
corporate
level,
exactly
the
same
as
and
exactly
equal
adjustment
at
the
corporate
level
with
respect
to
distributions
in
kind
as
does
the
present
regulation.
further
we
think
that
the
rule
adopted
by
the
regulation
is
consistent
with
really
the
thrust
of
the
taxes
involved
as
you
have
pointed
out.
the
thrust
of
the
taxes
involved
is
looking
towards
a
distribution
of
personal
holding
company
income
to
the
extent
a
corporation
distributes
property
in
which
it
has
invested
personal
holding
company
income
presumably.
it
effects
the
distribution
exactly
equal
to
the
amount
of
this
investment.
therefore,
we
think
the
regulation
not
taking
into
account
depreciations
and
value,
is
entirely
consistent
with
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
yes,
that
is
right
your
honor
because
that
depreciation
has
never
been
reflected
on
the
corporate
books.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
exactly
right.
it
is
carried
on
the
corporate
books
at
exactly
its
cost
basis.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
appears
not.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
it
is
just
the
capital
gain
tax,
although
other
records
are
little
vague.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
that
is
true,
yes.
inevitably
he
is
going
to
avoid
capital
gain
tax
at
the
corporate
level,
section
3(11)
and
this
court’s
opinion
in
general
utilities
make
it
clear
that
no
income
is
recognized
to
the
corporation
upon
the
distribution.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
oh!
he
avoids
distributing
personal
holding
company
income,
well,
only
if
he
wins.[laughter]
if
he
looses
then
the
tax
will
attach
to
the
amounts
of
personal
income,
an
income
which
we
say
remains
undistributed.
well,
so
return
to
the
54
code
revision,
the
statutes
themselves,
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
do
not
preclude
adoption
of
the
“adjusted
basis”
rule,
petitioners
even
concede
that
on
brief.
neither
section
562
of
the
code
nor
section
316
of
the
code
provides
a
rule
for
valuing
the
effect
of
the
distribution
in
kind
at
the
corporate
level.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
committee
reports
that
reflects
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
shift
the
emphasis
or
the
focus
of
the
dividend
paid
deduction,
completely
away
from
the
corporation.
indeed
there
are
certain
contrary
indications
as
i
have
pointed
out,
specifically
the
reference
to
the
300
code
provisions,
we
think
and
more
particularly
the
reference
in
the
senate
committee
report
to
section
3
(12)
gives
certain
legislative
warrant
for
applying
the
adjusted
basis
rule
under
these
circumstances.
and
more
to
the
point,
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
the
logical
rule
that
should
be
applied,
that
is
the
distribution
out
of
the
corporate
channel,
for
both
accounting
and
tax
purposes,
other
tax
purposes.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
27
(d)
we
think
reflects
a
punitive,
almost
a
punitive
go
with
respect
to
distributions
of
property
that
had
depreciated.
the
net
effect
of
that
section
is
to
require
either
that
personal
holding
company
realize
losses
at
the
corporate
level
and
actually
realize
a
diminution
in
corporate
assets
or
distribute
more
of
its
invested
property,
more
of
its
invested
earnings
than
it
has
undistributed
personal
holding
company
income
in
order
to
obtain
a
deduction
equal
to
the
amount
of
its
personal
holding
company,
undistributed
personal
holding
company
income.
so
in
effect
it
reflects
a
congressional
goal
to
see
the
ante
of
these
personal
holding
companies.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
oh!
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
they
are
healthy
inducement
to
distributions
of
realized
personal
holding
company
income.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
practically
speaking,
yes.
we
do
not
find
anything
in
either
the
legislative
history
or
in
this
court’s
opinion,
in
ivan
allen
which
runs
contrary
to
our
position
here.
and
i
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
on
the
specific
problem
here,
there
is
no
direct
bearing,
but
i
think
certain
dictum
in
the
court’s
opinion
clearly
supports
the
result
here.
this
court
was
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
yes
your
honor,
i
think
it
does
give
us
some
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
as
this
court
pointed
out,
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
specifically
involved
in
ivan
allen
attaches
only
to
realized
income
items,
on
realized
appreciation
figures,
not
of
the
all
in
the
computation
of
actual
tax
liabilities.
we
think
almost
by
partitive
reasoning
that
unrealized
appreciation
ought
not
to
figure
any
deduction
in
that
it
is
critical
to
the
computation
of
a
tax,
attaching
only
the
realized
income
items.
now,
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
ivan
allen
unrealized
appreciation
is
important
only
in
determining
whether
a
corporation
has
a
reasonable
business
need
to
accumulate
fully
realized
income
items.
that
effects
only
the
purpose
of
the
accumulations,
not
the
computation
of
the
taxes
involved.
we
think
the
clearly
indicates
that
unrealized
appreciation
ought
not
to
figure
in
the
computation
of
the
taxes
and
under
our
rule
that
under
unrealized
appreciation
does
not
figure
in
the
computation.
petitioner’s
rule
on
the
other
hand
would
permit
a
deduction
from
realized
income
items
for
appreciation
that
is
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
that
is
never
been
realized,
never
reflected
on
the
corporate
books.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
exactly.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
no,
i
am
sorry,
i
intended
the
say
unrealized.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
i
do
not
think
it
really
stands
with
that
proposition,
your
honor.
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
in
determining
whether
a
tax
payer
has
reasonable
business
need
to
accumulate
any
further
fully
realized
earnings
and
profits,
certain
unrealized
appreciation
in
investment
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
can
be
taken
in
to
account.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
yes,
must
be,
provided
only
that
it
is
readily
liquid
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
but
it
--
that
unrealized
appreciation
does
not
figure
into
the
measure
of
the
accumulated
taxable
income
subject
to
the
tax,
as
this
court’s
opinion
carefully
points
out,
and
we
think
since
it
does
not
figure
in
the
computation
of
the
income
subject
to
the
tax,
equally
it
ought
not
to
figure
in
a
corporate
deduction
which
operates
to
reduce
that
sort
of
same
tax.
mr.
michael
l.
paup
yes,
it
is
--
mr.
michael
l.
paup
well,
it
is
relevant
only
to
the
motive
underlying
the
accumulation
of
fully
realized
income.
in
sum
i
guess,
it
is
our
view
that
the
regulations
here
represent
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
revenue
statutes
involved.
they
are
consistent
with
their
history.
they
are
consistent
with
the
purpose.
that
purpose
being
to
force
a
distribution
of
unrealized
personal
holding
company
income.
they
are
consistent
with
the
terms
and
focus
of
the
tax
involved,
that
focus
being
on
only
realized
income
items.
they
are
finally
consistent
with
the
tax
treatment
accorded
corporate
distributions
in
kind
for
other
purposes,
general
accounting
purposes,
accounting
for
purposes
of
earnings
and
profits
under
section
3
(12).
in
our
view
the
first
circuit
was
correct
in
sustaining
them
and
we
would
submit
that
its
decision
ought
be
sustained.
