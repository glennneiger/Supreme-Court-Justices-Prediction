justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
because
it
is
of
some
importance
to
me.
you
are
saying
that
the
prior
to
1958,
there
was
flat
termination
when
there
was
marriage.
after
1958,
there
is
a
broad
classification
in
the
two
--
two
broad
categories
rather.
one
is
persons
who
marry
other
persons
who
are
covered,
and
the
other
classification
is
persons
that
is
secondary
beneficiaries,
who
marry
persons
who
are
not
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
should
test
this
statute
on
the
broad
classification.
i
notice
in
that
event,
actually
when
you
have
a
marriage
between
two
covered
persons
if
you
did
not
have
the
1958
amendment,
two
people
would
be
affected
by
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
the
statute
authorizes
a
benefit
for
disabled
children
of
wage
earner,
but
provides
that
the
benefits
shall
terminate
when
the
disabled
child
marries.
there
is
an
exceptional,
if
the
marriage
is
to
another
person
receiving
benefits
under
the
act.
the
appellee
in
this
case
has
been
disabled
by
the
cerebral
palsy
since
his
birth
in
1932.
he
qualified
for
child's
insurance
benefits
in
1957,
several
months
after
his
father
died.
in
1970
he
married
another
cerebral
palsy
victim.
since
his
wife
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
federal
act,
the
statute
required
the
secretary
to
terminate
his
benefits.
the
appellee
brought
this
suit
in
united
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
to
review
the
secretary's
action.
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
all
child
insurance
beneficiaries
are
not
treated
alike
when
they
marry
disabled
persons.
beneficiaries
who
marry
other
social
security
beneficiaries
continue
to
receive
benefits
whereas
those
like
the
appellee
in
this
case
who
marry
non-beneficiaries
lose
their
benefits
permanently,
even
though
their
spouses
may
be
unable
to
support
them.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
hold
that
the
statutory
probation
requiring
the
social
security
benefits
for
widows,
widowers,
parents
and
children
of
the
wage
earner
be
terminated
upon
the
beneficiary's
marriage
as
constitutional
and
further
that
congress
had
the
power
to
create
an
exception
for
the
special
hardship
which
results
when
two
beneficiaries
marry
one
another.
that
exception
is
not
unconstitutional
simply
because
it
does
not
extend
to
every
case
in
which
the
beneficiary's
continued
need
for
support
is
unaffected
by
his
marriage.
the
reasons
supporting
these
conclusions
are
set
forth
in
the
unanimous
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
