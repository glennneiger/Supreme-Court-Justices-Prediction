mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare.
the
judgment
of
united
states
district
court
and
western
district
of
missouri.
the
case
generally
involves
entitlement
provisions
of
section
202(d)
of
the
social
security
act
under
section
202(d)
as
the
court
may
recall
from
its
consideration
of
the
same
statute
two
term
ago
in
mathews
against
lucas,
insurance
benefits
are
provided
to
the
children
of
a
wage
earner
who
himself
is
receiving
old
age
or
disability
insurance
benefits
or
who
has
died
fully
or
currently
insured
under
the
act.
this
is
the
second
time
this
case
has
come
to
this
court.
as
i
will
explain
in
a
minute
the
insurance
provisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
cause
the
termination
in
appellee's
child’s
insurance
benefits
in
1970
when
he
married.
appellee
instituted
this
lawsuit
to
challenge
the
discontinuance
of
his
benefits
on
the
grounds
that
the
provisions
created
classifications
that
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
originally
the
district
court
agreed
with
appellee
and
declared
the
statute,
the
classification
unconstitutional
as
applied.
at
the
time
of
that
initial
judgment
in
early
1974
the
record
did
not
reflect
that
although
appellee's
social
insurance
benefits
were
terminated,
he
and
his
wife
nevertheless
were
receiving
benefits
under
another
title
of
social
security
program
title
xvi
the
new
supplemental
security
income
program
and
that
those
benefits
were
only
marginally
less
than
the
amount
of
benefits
that
he
and
his
wife
would
have
received
had
his
child’s
insurance
benefits
not
been
discontinued.
because
of
the
deficiency
in
the
record
when
the
secretary
first
appealed
to
this
court,
the
court
vacated
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
of
the
case
in
light
of
these
new
circumstances.
on
remand
record
was
supplemented
by
stipulation,
but
the
district
court
reinstated
its
original
judgment,
holding
that
the
supplemental
security
income
program
was
irrelevant
to
appellee’s
claim.
the
secretary
appealed
the
second
time
and
that
is
the
present
posture
of
this
case
as
the
court
considers
it.
let
me
describe
briefly
the
provision
of
section
202(d)
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
and
their
effect
on
appellee.
among
other
entitlement
provisions
of
section
202(d),
the
applicant
or
child’s
insurance
benefits,
that
is
the
son
or
daughter
of
a
wage
earner
must
be
unmarried,
appellee
was
unmarried
in
1957
when
he
originally
applied
for
benefits
up
on
the
death
of
his
father.
now
the
other
eligible
requirements
of
section
202(d)
include
the
requirement
that
the
child
be,
at
the
time
of
his
application,
dependent
upon
the
wage
earner.
that
was
the
requirement
that
the
court
considered
in
lucas
and
also
that
at
the
time
of
the
application
the
child
be
either
under
18
or
a
full
time
student
under
age
22
or
that
the
child
be
disabled,
the
disability
having
begun
before
the
child
became
age
22.
regarding
the
benefits
of
the
disabled
child,
so
long
as
the
disability
began
before
age
22,
the
benefits
were
continued
without
regard
to
age.
appellee
jobst
for
example
is
a
child,
is
a
person
who
has
been
disabled
since
birth
and
he
was
there
for
eligible
to
receive
insurance
benefits
even
though
he
was
25
when
his
father
died.
in
contrast
the
benefits
to
non
disable
children
are
terminated
when
the
child
attains
the
age
of
18
or
22
depending
on
whether
or
not
he
is
a
student.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
justice
blackmun
the
record
does
not
show
the
numbers
that
are
involved
in
this
case
and
i
am
not
aware
of
the
numbers.
i
suspect,
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
social
security
administration
that
the
numbers
are
very,
very
low
but
i
do
not
have
exact
figures.
the
statute
does
provide
that
there
are
certain
events
terminate
child
insurance
benefits,
when
the
non
disabled
child
reaches
a
certain
age,
is
one,
we
just
mentioned
death
is
another.
event
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
marriage.
statute
provide
with
one
narrow
exception,
that
all
child's
insurance
beneficiaries
whether
they
are
disabled
or
non
disabled,
student
or
non
student
lose
there
entitlement
to
benefits
when
they
marry
that
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
i
will
go
on
to
argue
the
general
termination
rule
is
itself
rational
and
because
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1958
to
provide
a
limited
exception
for
certain
disabled
children
does
not
change
that
analysis.
simply
introduces
a
new
element
in
to
the
inquiry
and
as
we
have
explained
in
our
brief,
the
classification
created
by
that
narrow
exception
is
rational.
there
was
a
reason
for
congress
to
treat
that
special
class
of
beneficiaries
under
title
ii
of
the
act
and
not
appellee's
situation.
now
when
child’s
insurance
benefits
were
first
provided
there
was
no
narrow
exception
to
the
general
termination
rule.
in
1958
congress
amended
the
statute
to
provide
that
benefits
would
not
be
discontinued
when
a
disabled
child’s
insurance
beneficiary
married
an
individual
who
also
was
entitled
to
insurance
benefits
under
the
act.
in
those
cases
the
amendment
provided
that
marriage
would
not
terminate
benefits.
i
will
explain
the
congress's
reason
for
enacting
that
narrow
exception
later
but
it
is
relevant
here
to
know
only
that
the
rationale
or
the
amendment
does
not
cover
appellee.
appellee
is
a
disabled
child’s
insurance
beneficiary
or
was
a
disabled
child’s
insurance
beneficiary
but
his
wife
was
not
an
insurance
beneficiary
under
the
act.
his
marriage
therefore
like
the
marriage
of
most
other
child’s
insurance
beneficiaries,
was
terminated
because
of
his
marriage.
now
central
to
the
district
court’s
reason
in
this
case
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
correct
and
that
was
central
to
the
district
court's
analysis
in
this
case
is
that
his
wife
is
disabled.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
right,
her
parent
was
not
an
insured
wage
earner
and
therefore
she
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
under
title
ii
of
the
act
by
the
virtue
of
her
mother
or
father.
that
was
central
to
the
district
court's
analysis
in
this
case
that
is
that
his
wife
was
disabled
and
unable
to
provide
support
for
him.
court
suggested
that
termination
is
rational
where
the
beneficiary
marries
someone
who
is
able
to
support
him.
but
where
the
beneficiary
marries
someone
who
can
not
support
him,
the
court
reasoned
the
need
for
support
continues
and
so
as
a
constitutional
matter
once
benefits
continue.
the
record
does
reflect
that
sandra
jobst,
appellee's
wife,
is
disabled
and
unable
to
provide
support.
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
it
is
because
of
that
disability
and
because
of
their
need
for
assistance,
that
sandra
and
john
jobst
now
receive
a
monthly
benefit
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program
and
as
i
mentioned--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
it
is
part
of
title
xvi
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
benefit
provisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
are
title
ii,
it
is
the
same
act,
it’s
a
form
of
federal
relief.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
the
difference
in
amount
to
that
the
record
reflex
in
the
stipulation
in
that
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
mr.
justice
byron,
that
at
the
time
that
stipulation
was
entered
into,
there
was
approximately
$20
difference,
that
is
sandra
and
john
jobst
were
receiving
$20
less
than
they
would
have
received.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
per
month.
if
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
there
has
been
some
change
in
circumstances
which
is
not
reflected
on
the
record.
i
understand
from
appellee's
brief
that
sandra
and
john
jobst
are
separated
and
now
divorced
and
i
understand
from
the
social
security
administration
that,
that
has
caused
increase
in
both
of
there
individual
rates
for
supplemental
security
income.
that
is
when
they
were
married
they
were
receiving
a
couple
rate
which
per
person
was
less,
now
that
they
are
separated,
the
per-person
supplemental
security
income
is
increased.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no
it
is
not
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
a
limited
re-entitlement
provision
which
is
section
202(d)
(6)
and
i
think
the
only
circumstance
in
which
a
person
loses
entitlement
and
then
can
be
re-entitled,
is
if
he
passes
the
age
18
and
then
become
a
full
time
student,
he
can
then
receive
benefits
from
the
time
he
become
full
time
student
till
age
22.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
there
is
no
re-entitlement
after
marriage.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
or
the
death
of
the
spouse,
that
is
correct.
only
a
very
narrow
re-entitlement
provision.
i
will
discuss
the
significance
of
the
ssi
in
a
moment
but
for
now
i
would
like
argue
that
even
if
ssi
were
not
in
existence,
the
statutory
insurance
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case
are
constitutional.
in
holding
to
the
contrary,
the
district
court
reasoned
or
drew
significance
from
the
fact
that
appellee
remained
needy
after
his
marriage.
but
in
so
reasoning
the
court
fell
victim
to
misunderstandings
concerning
open
nature
of
title
ii
of
the
act
and
of
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
cause.
under
title
ii
of
the
act,
an
individual’s
actual
need
in
a
welfare
sense
has
no
part
in
the
allocation
of
benefits.
benefits
are
not
paid
on
the
basis
of
an
individual’s
need.
rather
title
ii
is
a
program
of
social
insurance
designed
to
protect
the
wage
earner
and
his
family
from
a
loss
of
income
occasioned
by
the
wage
earner's
disability,
retirement
or
death.
benefits
are
paid
to
members
of
the
wage
earner’s
family
because
they
are
presumed
to
be
dependent
on
the
wage
earner
and
they
are
the
ones
who
are
most
likely
to
suffer
from
a
loss
of
the
wage
earner's
income.
plus
it
is
this
relationship
of
dependency
with
the
wage
earner
that
is
the
critical
factor
in
determining
an
individual's
entitlement
to
what
we
call
secondary
insurance
benefits,
that
is
benefits
payable
to
the
individual
member
of
the
wage
earner's
family
on
the
basis
the
wage
earner's
account.
now
these
propositions
are
hardly
new
to
this
court,
indeed
in
stating
them
i
have
been
paraphrasing
from
many
of
the
court's
recent
decisions.
decisions
in
cases
such
as
weinberger
against
salfi,
mathews
against
lucas,
califano
against
goldfarb,
mathews
against
de
castro.
these
cases
all
stress
that
title
ii
benefits
are
not
paid
on
the
basis
of
individual
need,
but
instead
are
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
family's
presumed
need.
an
individual's
membership
in
that
family
and
his
presumed
dependency
on
the
wage
earner's
income.
that
is
why
in
de
castro
where
the
court
considered
claims
of
the
divorced
wife
for
benefits
under
the
act.
the
court
said
that
arguments
concerning
the
divorced
wife's
economic
situation
were
“hardly
in
point”.
divorce
works
a
substantial
change
in
the
relationship
of
dependency
between
the
wage
earner
and
spouse,
and
that
was
sufficient
in
the
court's
view
to
sustain
the
different
treatment
of
divorced
wives.
the
same
analysis
is
appropriate
here.
wholly
aside
from
a
concept
of
economic
need,
upon
marrying
a
child
normally
departs
the
family,
the
wage
earner's
family
which
title
ii
is
designed
to
protect
and
here
she
starts
a
new
family.
like
divorce
for
a
wife,
a
child's
marriage
generally
changes
or
reduces
the
relationship
of
dependency
between
a
wage
earner
and
his
parent.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
pardon
me
mr.
justice
marshall
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
it
is
normal,
i
think
in
a
matter
whether
it
is
the--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
pardon
me.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
it
is
normal
that
when
a
person
marries,
the
relationship
of
dependency
between
the
child
and
his
parents
is
reduced
or
ended
all
together
and
i
think
that
is
true
without
regard
to
whether
or
not,
the
wage
earner's
child
is
a
woman
or
a
man.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
that
is
correct,
especially
in--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
right.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
think
in
allocating
benefits
under
title
ii,
congress
has
designed
an
insurance
program,
not
a
welfare
program
or
a
general
assistance
program,
and
has
allocated
benefits
on
the
basis
of
these
broad
presumption
which
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
sustained
as
constitutional
and
as
a
reasonable
way
of
allocating
insurance
benefits.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
turn
on
lucas
was
reasonable
empirical
judgments
about
the
likelihood
of
dependency
and
the
likelihood
of
an
event’s
effect
on
the
dependency.
and
that
is
what
title
ii
is
really
all
about,
wherein
so
far
as
secondary
insurance
benefits
are
concerned
that
is
the
likelihood
of
dependency
upon
the
wage
earner,
person's
membership
in
the
wage
earner's
family.
and
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
said
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
case
by
case
adjudication
of
that.
broad
legislative
classification
such
as
our
issue
here
are
necessarily
only
imperfect
substitutes
for
case
by
case
adjudication.
this
court
in
cases
such
as
lucas
and
de
castro
however
has
held
that
these
broad
legislative
classification
are
valid,
so
long
as
they
reasonably
reflect
the
likelihood
of
dependency
and
that
is
what
the
general
termination
rule
here
does,
it
reflects
the
common
experience
view
that
marriage
normally
ends
or
we
substantially
reduces
a
child's
special
need
for
parental
support
and
that
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
general
termination
rule.
now
the
district
court
and
the
appellee
argue
that
even
if
the
general
termination
rule
is
rational,
the
narrow
amendment
for
certain
disabled
children
creates
an
unconstitutional
distinction.
remember
in
1958
congress
enacted
a
narrow
exception
to
provide
that
benefits
not
be
discontinued
when
a
disabled
child's
insurance
beneficiary
marries
someone
who
also
is
entitled
to
insurance
benefits
under
the
act
and
the
argument
in
essence
is
that
having
decided
to
extend
benefits
to
that
class
of
beneficiary,
congress
is
also
constitutionally
required
to
extend
benefits
to
appellee.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
guess,
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes
that
is
correct
because
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
appellee
and
the
class
of
beneficiaries,
benefited
by
the
amendment
and
therefore
it
was
irrational
to
extend
benefits
to
one
and
not
the
other.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
now
as
we
explained
in
our
brief
the
narrow
exception
to
the
general
termination
rule
is
part
of
a
broad
set
of
amendments
in
1958.
several
other
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
providing
benefits
to
members
of
the
wage
earner's
family
require
that
that
beneficiary
be
unmarried
or
unremarried,
the
widow
or
widower
for
example
of
the
wage
earner.
the
1958
amendments
added
a
savings
clause
to
each
of
these
provisions
requiring
or
providing
generally
that
insurance
beneficiary’s
benefits
are
not
discontinued
when
they
marry
another
insurance
beneficiary
under
the
act.
the
principle
reason
for
these
amendments
is
explained
in
the
legislative
history.
congress
understood
that
a
marriage
between
two
insurance
beneficiaries
caused
a
simultaneous
termination
of
benefits.
if
for
example
an
aged
widow
married
a
disabled
child's
insurance
beneficiary
who
remember
is
paid
benefits
without
regard
to
age,
both
of
their
benefits
would
be
terminated
under
the
act
as
it
stood
prior
to
1958.
congress
recognize
that
this
was
a
special
form
of
hardship
and
i
say
special
because
it
was
uniquely
caused
by
the
internal
workings
of
the
social
security
act
and
so
congress
determined
to
the
remediate
the
problem
or
the
perceived
hardship
by
amending
the
act
rather
than
establishing
a
new
program.
and
it
was
easy
to
remediate
this
problem
within
the
existing
benefit
structure
without
added
administrative
cost
or
without
alteration
of
the
method
of
allocating
benefits
under
title
ii.
marriages
between
insurance
beneficiaries
was
a
readily
identifiable
situation.
both
of
these
person's
status
and
situation
was
known
to
the
social
security
administration
because
they
were
already
receiving
benefits
under
the
act.
moreover,
the
problem
presented
by
these
marriages
could
be
readily
resolved
by
simply
amending
the
statute
to
provide
that
benefits
not
to
be
discontinued.
sure
these
amendments
were
viewed
as
an
easy
cure
to
what
was
perceived
as
a
flaw
in
internal
workings
of
the
system.
appellee
did
not
marry
another
child's
insurance
beneficiary;
therefore
to
the
extent
that
he
remained
needy,
his
continued
need
was
not
occasioned
by
the
circumstances
that
congress
sought
to
remedy
in
1958.
yes
of
course
they
accord
no
principle
of
constitutional
adjudication.
the
congress
may
constitutionally
spend
money
to
solve
one
problem
and
not
another,
so
long
as
this
spending
decision
is
not
arbitrary.
here
there
was
a
good
reason
worked
for
resolving
the
problem
of
marriage
between
two
insurance
beneficiaries
under
title
ii
of
the
act
but
not
resolving
the
problem
created
by
appellee's
situation.
as
i
mentioned
it
was
easy
to
identify
the
marriage
of
insurance
beneficiaries
but
appellee's
need
which
arises
from
his
marriage
to
someone
who
is
unknown
to
the
social
security
administration
could
not
be
identified
without
substantial
alteration
in
the
method
of
allocating
benefits
that
is
presently
employed
in
title
ii.
title
ii
uses
broad
presumptions
as
to
dependency
as
we
said
and
that
method
would
not
identify
appellee.
i
suppose
it
would
also
not
be
a
sufficient
indicator
of
need
that
appellee's
wife
is
disabled
since
presumably
disabled
people
may
have
resources
or
be
able
to
otherwise,
in
some
other
way
to
provide
support.
so
what
would
really
be
needed
is
a
very
close
analysis
of
the
marriages
of
all
insurance
beneficiaries
to
determine
who
is
needy
and
who
is
not
and
presumably
that
inquiry
would
call
for
that
determination,
would
call
for
a
close
detail
month
by
month
inquiry
into
eligibility.
moreover,
this
title
ii
would
have
to
be
further
altered
to
pay
these
persons
on
the
basis
of
these
individualized
determinations
of
need
and
as
i
have
explained
today
and
as
we
have
explained
at
length
in
our
brief,
title
ii
is
simply
not
setup
for
that
purpose
and
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
it
be
altered
to
accommodate
that
purpose.
instead,
without
working
such
a
drastic
change
in
title
ii.
congress
instead
has
designed
general
assistance
programs
to
work
in-tandem
with
the
insurance
provisions
of
the
act,
by
providing
that
further
relief
of
need
that
is
not
covered
by
insurance
programs.
here
in
particular
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program
provided
for
in
sections
of
the
title
xvi
of
the
act,
benefits
are
allocated
on
a
basis
of
an
individual's
need.
appellee's
case
rest,
ultimately
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
needy
person
but
the
supplemental
security
income
program
has
taken
up
where
title
ii
has
left
off
in
providing
the
appellee
with
the
form
of
federal
relief.
i
think
when
seen
in
this
context,
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
appellee
has
been
treated
rationally
by
the
social
security
program
and
that
the
title
ii
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case
are
constitutional.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
so
long
as
the
purpose
is
permissible
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
issue
about
that
here
if
the
means
are
rationally
related
to
those
events.
court
has
said
that
the
social
welfare
programs
or
classifications
dealing
with
economic
and
social
welfare
issues
can
be
sustained.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well
it
deters
marriage;
i
suppose
in
the
same
sense
that
other
laws
which
affect
an
individual
and
then
whether
or
not
he
gets
married
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
the
appellees’
and
the
district
court's
focus
is
on
the
distinction
created
by
the
narrow
exception.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
do
not
need
to
pay
any
attention
to
that,
although
i
do
think
that
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
appellee's
argument
implicates
that
general
termination
rule.
i
think
we
necessarily
had
to
address
the
issue
in
our
brief
and
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
tax
law
was
something
i
had
in
mind
when
i
was
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
do
not--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
de
castro
could
be
said
implicated
the
same
kind
of
personal
decisions.
the
divorce
or
continuing
marriage
of
an
individual
and
certainly
the
unanimous
court
there
did
not
subject
to
the
classification
to
any
higher
form
of
a
scrutiny,
than
that
which
i
have
identified
today.
i
think
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
statute
would
not
survive
a
higher
form
of
scrutiny.
when
i
think
that
we
are
talking
here
about--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
have
trouble.
but,
i
have
not
really
frankly
thought
about
it.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
that
is
right,
i
think
because
really
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
district
court's
concern
is
the
fact
that
the
underlying
assumptions
in
the
general
termination
rule,
may
not
have
worked
in
this
case.
appellee
may
have
married
someone
who
is
not
able
to
provide
support
for
him
and
i
think
the
point
of
our
--
that
portion
of
our
brief
and
the
portion
of
my
argument
today
points
out
that
that
is
largely
an
irrelevant
consideration.
when
we
are
caught
talking
about
insurance
benefits,
title
ii
of
the
act,
since
the
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
a
situation
which
the
social
security
act
does
not
address.
i
suppose
if
there
is
an
annulment.
i
do
not
know
the
legal
affect
of
an
annulment,
if
the
marriage
were
void
out
and
we
see
a--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
annulment
is
a
special
circumstance
that
i
had
not
given
explicit
consideration
to.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
would
think
so,
unless
he
had
a
good
lawyer
who
can
make
an
argument
that
annulment
avoided
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
ab
initio,
so
that
in
the
essence
under
the
law
he
was
really
never
married.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no,
i
certainly
think
that
the
insurance
provision
at
issue
can
be
sustained
as
constitutional
and
should
be
sustained
without
reference
to
the
ssi
program.
i
think
that
the
existence
of
the
ssi
program,
however
underscores
the
purpose
of
title
ii
and
how
to
social
security
program
inter
relates,
different
program
inter
relates
and
i
certainly
think
that
to
the
extent
that
appellee's
claim
is
based
on
the
fact
that
he
his
needy.
ssi
benefits
provide
relief
for
that
form
of
need.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
no
and
i
think
the
remand
in
the
first
instance
was
largely
to
supplement
the
record
to
bring
that
into
the
case.
but
not
our
position
is
that
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
with
or
without
of
the
ssi
program.
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
two
very
short
points.
first,
i
would
like
to
confirm
that
mr.
justice
stevens,
your
understanding
of
the
act
with
regard
to
other
secondary
insurance
beneficiaries
is
correct.
for
example,
take
a
widower,
those
provisions
provide
with
section
202
(f)
that
if
the
widower
marries,
the
secondary
insurance
benefits
are
terminated
but
then
there
is
savings
provision
in
202(f)(4)
for
when
the
insurance
beneficiary
marries
someone
else
who
is
entitled
to
insurance
benefits
under
the
act.
so
contrary
to
appellee's
protestations
about
how
narrow
this
case
is,
i
think
a
principle
of
broad
application
is
involved
in
this
case.
indeed
i
think
it
is
broader
than
that
because
the
court's
rational
--
the
district
court's
rational
carry
to
its
logical
extreme.
as
i
mentioned
in
my
argument,
i
think
would
require
congress
to
attack
a
needs
test
under
all
terminating
events.
events
such
as
non-disabled
children
reaching
age
18,
for
example.
it
is
true
that
there
is
not
a
congruence
between
the
district
court's
judgment
and
its
rational.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
is
correct.
as
i
said,
it
would
cause
a
simultaneous
termination
of
both
of
their
benefits
and
that
was
the
hardship
the
congress
was
concerned
with.
also
to
clarify
appellee
mentioned
that
there
was
a
$9000
difference
in
the
payments,
that
is
covered
in
the
stipulation
of
that
page
15
of
our
appendix.
the
$9000
reflects
the
amount
of
secondary
child
insurance
benefits
that
would
have
been
paid,
have
these
benefits
not
been
discontinued.
the
secretary
maintains
if
that
money
had
been
paid,
he
would
be
entitled
to
recoup
as
overpayment.
the
amount
of
ssi
benefits
that
has
been
paid,
that
is
approximately
$3000
and
the
reason
it
is
so
low
is
that
from
1971,
appellee
married,
till
1974
there
were
no
ssi
benefits.
appellee
was
receiving
state
welfare
insurance
but
not
ssi.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
our
brief
then
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reserved.
thank
you.
