mr.
j.
d.
riffel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
john
jobst.
mr.
jobst
maintains
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
remand
should
be
affirmed.
i
think
that
at
the
beginning
there
are
certain
things
we
want
to
emphasize.
number
one
the
holding
of
the
district
court
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
to
the
effect
that
202(d)
puts
child's
insurance
beneficiaries
who
are
disabled
into
two
classes.
one
class
of
totally
disabled
recipients
who
marry
other
totally
recipients
and
continue
to
receive
social
security
benefits,
and
a
second
class
which
marries
totally
disabled
non-recipients.
in
this
case,
a
recipient
of
welfare
benefits
and
for
this
reason
alone,
perpetually,
loses
his
right
to
lifetime
social
security
benefits.
as
was
admitted
by
appellant,
this
termination
is
perpetual.
mr.
jobst
therefore
by
the
statute
is
relegated
to
a
lifetime
of
receipt
of
welfare
benefits.
this
is
a
case
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
a
supplemental
security
income
or
whether
it
is
federally
assisted,
welfare
disability
benefits
under
statute's
of
the
state
of
missouri.
it
is
still
welfare,
its
still
need
based.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
do
specifically
that
as
was
read
by
judge
oliver
in
section
202(d)(5)(b),
capital
b
i
believe.
it
specifically
speaks
of
disabled
child
recipients
who
do
marry
other
disabled
child
recipients.
so
under
that
specific
provision,
i
think
the
holding
of
the
court
could
be
very
narrowly
limited
to
that
section
b
and
perhaps
the
constitutionality
of
section
a
which
refers
to
general
marriages
to,
like
someone
receiving
old
age
benefits
could
be
left
alone,
that
would
be
one
possibility.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
well
if
you
look
at
the
broadest
spectrum
i
think
it
is,
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes.
the
statutory
scheme
as
i
hold
generally
provides
that
anyone
who
marries
another
recipient
who
is
eligible
under
that
statute
continues
to
receive
benefit.
all
i
am
saying
is
there
a
narrow
provision
which
i
think
is
what
district
court
was
looking
at
in
this
specific
case.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
that’s
my
precise
point.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
now
another
point,
we
want
to
emphasize
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
in
benefits
at
the
time
of
the
remand
of
this
case,
there
was
considerable
disagreement
between
the
government's
position
and
our
position,
as
to
just
what
affect
ssi
and
self
security
benefits
had,
as
compared
to
one
another
on
level
of
benefits.
the
government
chose
to
compare
that
as
to
the
family.
mr.
jobst,
the
dependent
of
an
insured
wage
earner,
however,
admittedly
was
receiving
far
less
than
he
would
have,
had
he
been
a
social
security
recipient.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
ssi
is
based
on
need.
that
is
for
every
$2
earned
above
$80,
the
benefits
are
reduced
by
a
total
of
$1.
under
a
social
security,
mr.
jobst's
assets
are
unlimited;
he
could
become
a
millionaire
by
a
windfall
and
still
receive
benefits
under
ssi.
at
the
most
mr.
jobst
can
have
an
assets
is
$2,250
and
remain
eligible.
another
important
point
is
that
congress
has
in
fact
discriminated
as
to
level
of
benefits
between
social
security
and
supplemental
security
income
from
a
historical
perspective.
this
is
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
remand,
and
the
entry
of
the
stipulation
which
was
the
record
on
remand
in
this
case,
there
was
a
difference
of
some
$9,000
in
the
level
of
benefits
received
by
mr.
jobst
as
compared
to
what
he
would
have
received,
had
he
continued
receiving
social
security
benefits.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
even
had
mr.
jobst
remained
married
which
he
did
not,
his
marriage
is
now
been
dissolved,
he
has
no
further
relationship
to
sandra
jobst,
he
is
now
living
alone.
even
had
he
remained
married
then
an
amount
of
$20
which
it
was
at
that
time
for
a
month
for
a
person
or
family
with
an
income
so
low,
can
be
a
huge
amount
of
money
to
that
family.
now
just
what
did
the
district
court
do,
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
very
strange
holding,
i
do
not
think
the
court
deviated
in
any
way
from
any
current
standard
established
by
this
court.
rather
i
think
that
court
was
looking
to
the
central
question
under
the
social
security
act,
that
question
being,
was
that
person
dependent?
did
he
remain
dependent
on
the
insured
wage
earner?
was
that
terminating
event
reasonable?
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct
and
you
would
be
a
better
judge
than
i
of
this,
but
my
understanding
of
your
current
opinions
are
that
you
still
apply
the
standard
established
in
richardson
vs.
belcher
and
fleming
vs.
nestor,
that
is
imposing
the
equal
protection
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
fifth
amendment,
as
to
federal
legislation
and
stating
that
an
utterly
irrational
discriminatory
classification
is
borrowed
by
the
fifth
amendment.
i
do
not
believe
that
those
more
recent
cases
change
that
standard
and
the
district
court
specifically
cited
richardson
vs.
belcher
and
fleming
vs.
nestor.
this
was
the
standard
that
was
applied,
and
under
my
understanding
this
is
still
the
proper
standard
applied
by
the
court.
this
is
also
consistent
in
the
view
of
mr.
jobst
with
the
case
of
mathews
vs.
lucas
and
other
more
recent
cases
which
have
consistently
stated,
that
it
must
be
judged
against
the
standard
of
the
actual
purpose
of
congress
enacting
child's
insurance
benefits.
now
what
was
that
standard?
why
was
it
enacted?
it
is
quite
clear
at
the
time
of
the
original
enactment
of
that
act
in
1956,
that
congress
had
two
objectives
in
mind.
the
first
objective
was
to
assure
that
dependence
of
insured
wage
earners
had
a
certain
amount
of
security
and
income
in
the
event
of
the
death,
disability,
or
retirement
of
the
insured
wage
earner.
the
second
reason
which
we
submit
is
equally
important
and
under
which
there
is
as
much
discrimination,
in
this
particular
case
is
to
assure
the
american
worker,
that
in
the
event
of
his
retirement,
death,
or
disability,
that
a
disabled
child
who
was
unable
to
provide
for
himself
will
be
taken
care
of,
under
the
child's
insurance
provisions.
now
that
original
act
requires
that
the
party
established
dependency
on
that
insured
wage
earner
in
order
to
be
eligible
--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
first
to
the
statute
itself
and
what
it
actually
stated?
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
statute
itself,
we
argued
at
one
point
that
under,
what
we
called
i
think
a
liberal,
reading
of
the
statute
that
you
could
state
that
congress
never
intended
this
party
to
lose
his
benefits
upon
marriage.
i
think
that,
that
could
be
read
into
the
act
and
that
anything
that
happened
in
this
case
in
terms
of
his
termination,
i
think
may
have
been
a
non-intentional
application
of
the
act
something
they
never
thought
of,
but
on
the
other
hand
under
a
strict
reading
of
that
law,
yes,
its
clear
that
it
is
as
originally
acted
and
as
it
exists
it
does
terminate
benefits.
but
on
the
other
hand
the
legislative
history
of
this
law
is
quite
clear,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
statutory
scheme
which
has
been
in
effect
for
a
short
period
of
time.
social
security
benefits
have
existed
since
the
1930s.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
well
i
think
any
time
you
have
a
situation,
your
honor,
where
a
statute
excludes
a
certain
class,
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
essential
purpose
of
that
legislation.
it
is
not
a
question
what
statute
says,
it
s
the
question
of
whether
that
statute
is
constitutional
and
whether
it’s
prescribed
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes
sir.
it’s
clearly
the
question.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
think
that’s
correct.
yeah.
i
think
this
court
have
said
time
and
again
that
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
sure,
but
it
still
have
some
way.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
the
wording
of
the
statute?
your
honor,
in
my
view,
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statue
--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
the
wording
simply
states
that
unless
the
party
marry
someone
who
also
receives
disability
benefits
under
section
b
that
they
are
to
be
terminated
and
i
think
that
fails
to
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
many
recipients
who
are
suffering
in
the
same
hardship
as
a
result
of
marriage
who
are
disabled
as
recovered
by
the
statute.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
well,
i
think--
i
do
not
think
it
makes
it
unconstitutional,
no
sir,
if
it
is
under-inclusive,
i
think
under
weinberger
vs.--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
no
sir,
i
think
this
is
no
more
an
extension
of
the
law
than
jimenez
vs.
weinberger.
what
we
are
saying
is--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
you
can
just
say
that,
that
statutory
scheme
applies
unconstitutionally
to
mr.
jobst.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
because
of
his
peculiar
circumstances
and
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
a
very
small
class
of
persons
just
like
him,
whose
benefits
are
terminated
who
have
the
same
continuing
need
for
insurance
benefits
as
the
other
subclass
and
are
invidiously
discriminated
against
by
effect
of
the
statutory
scheme.
i
think
that
is
just
fundamental
constitutional
law
applied
by
this
court.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
is
a
completely
different
situation.
marriage
is
terminating
an
event,
normally
is
rational.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
there
is
no
question
about
it,
yes
sir,
numerous
things
can
terminate,
but
as
to
this
class
of
disabled
persons
i
think
as
a
reasonable
empirical
judgment,
congress
could
say
that
as
a
--
to
a
disabled
person,
they
very
often
do
not
marry
people
capable
of
supporting
them.
in
fact
general
experience
would
indicate
that
they
very
often
marry
people
like
themselves.
most
child's
insurance
beneficiaries
under
the
legislative
history,
as
stated
by
congress,
it
was
anticipated
that
they
would
have
been
disabled
from
birth,
birth
defects,
in
this
case
both.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
for
age
18,
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
it
could
be
something
like
car
accident
or
something
like
that
but
where
they
were
speaking
of
what
they
anticipated
to
be
the
usual
case
for
example,
both
of
these
recipients
suffer
from
cerebral
palsy.
they
are
the
identical,
i
have
seen
both
of
them
have
almost
the
identical
disability.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
that
you
have
just
an
accidental
application
in
the
case
of,
it
is
not
very
likely
widower
is
going
to
plan
out
marry
another
disabled
person
and
under
the
statute,
if
a
widower
does
marry
another--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yeah,
i
understand
it
that
very
often
old
people
do
not
marry
but
they
just
live
together
because
of
that
in
forward
and
so
forth
but
i
think
there
is
no
such
exception
as--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
well
i
think
that
if--.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
legislation,
a
disabled
child,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
he
is
never
going
to
accumulate
enough
work
credits
to
receive
social
security
on
his
own;
he
always
going
to
be
disabled.
it
is
not
for
a
short
period
of
time
such
as
--
or
relatively
short
period
time
as
such
with
an
older
person,
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
think
the
difference
is
that
congress
has
not
recognized
a
marriage
as
an
exception
in
the
cases
to
which
you
speak,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
child's
insurance
benefits,
congress
has
actually
said,
look
we
can
see
that
marriage
of
a
person
like
this
does
not
affect
his
dependency
on
the
insured
wage
earner.
for
example,
mr.
jobst's
marriage
and
his
divorce
were
really
unrelated,
totally
unrelated.
congress
recognized
that,
they
saw
that
hardship.
they
recognized
the
hardship
of
recipients,
but
there
was
a
subclass
of
recipients
they
left
out.
by
doing
so,
by
taking
this
specific
affirmative
action,
in
my
view
under
a
proper
application
of
the
fifth
amendment,
you
have
a
different
situation,
you
have
an
actual
decision
and
actual
recognition
stated
in
the
statute
actually
written
in
words
as
to
those
specific
persons.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
do
not
know,
i
did
not
think
it
was.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
i
do
not
think
it
is.
as
to
a
disabled
child,
who
marries
a
widower,
his
benefits
would
continue,
if
that
is
what
you
mean
but
i
do
not
think
that
a
widower
receiving
benefits,
who
marries
a
disabled
child,
necessarily
continues
to
receive
his
benefits.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
okay,
i
am
mistaken.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
in
that
event,
it
obviously
could
be
applied
under
other
situation,
but
i
do
think
that
the
situation
is
such
that
it
could
be
a
narrow
holding.
i
think
someone
else
is
going
to
come
along
and
say
it
applies
to
my
situation,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
the
child
insurance
provisions
then
are
a
mere
restatement
of
the
general
purposes
of
social
security
benefits
and
that
is
to
provide
a
continuing
income
to
the
insured
worker
and
his
dependence
in
the
event
of
disability,
retirement,
or
death.
in
this
case,
the
secretary
has
placed
great
reliance
on
the
premise
that
to
promote
administrative
ease,
administration
of
social
security
benefit,
this
court
should
not
look
at
this
provision,
should
not
question
its
constitutionality
because
this
provision
is
necessary
to
ease
the
administration
of
the
act.
under
our
view,
when
compared
with
recent
decisions
of
this
case,
this
is
not
the
case.
there
are,
i
am
sure,
certain
presumptions
which
could
be
established
properly
under
this
act
to
determine
whether
mr.
jobst
in
fact,
does
still
need
social
security
benefits
as
a
dependent
of
an
insured
worker,
but
this
is
not
a
proper
classification.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
weinberger
vs.
salfi,
this
court
examined
a
nine-month
duration
of
limitation
statute
which,
in
fact,
an
affect
provided
that
a
survivor
and
the
children
of
that
person
of
an
insured
worker
must
wait
nine
months
following
the
date
of
the
marriage
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
secondary
benefits
as
the
survivors
of
the
beneficiary.
the
court
looked
at
that
duration
requirement
and
compared
it
to
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
what
the
court
stated
was
that
those
purposes
were
related
to
the
dependency
of
the
insured
wage
earner
that
the
classifications
established
must
be
measured
against
the
dependency
of
the
insured
wage
earner
established
which
was
reflected
by
the
classifications.
now
in
that
case,
in
the
salfi
case,
it
was
clear
one
that
congress
had
stated
a
real
concerned
over
false
claims
for
benefits
where
individuals
would
marry
sick
insured
workers,
simply
because
they
knew
that
person
soon
would
be
disabled,
die,
or
retire
and
therefore
enabled
themselves
to
lifetime
social
security
benefits.
this
is
not
the
case
with
child's
insurance
benefits.
congress
has
specifically
examined
this
question,
it
is
stated
in
the
legislative
history
that
one,
they
need
not
be
concerned
with
determinations
of
disability
as
they
were
in
the
case
of
the
other
disability
provisions
for
insured
workers.
the
reason
being
one,
this
is
a
small
class
of
people,
it
is
not
very
many
disabled
children
entitled
to
benefits.
secondly,
because
of
congenital
problems
and
so
forth,
in
most
cases,
the
disability
will
be
very
apparent.
now
when
we
compare
this
with
the
salfi
case,
this
is
a
quite
different
situation
which
the
court
is
faced
with
than
in
that
case.
there
is
also
the
further
consideration
that
the
standards
of
disability
must
have
been
very
similar.
disability
benefits
under
welfare
statutes
have
been
controlled
by
federal
regulations
under
the
social
security
act
for
a
long
time,
a
long
time
before
the
enactment
of
supplemental
security
income.
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program
now,
again
the
social
security
administration
has
access
to
information
on
those
disability
benefits
and
there
is
a
further
reason
that
under
the
narrow
holding
of
this
court
as
to
other
disabled
children
under
section
b,
in
most
cases
that
disability
is
going
to
be
readily
apparent.
for
example,
in
this
case,
she
was
a
victim
of
cerebral
palsy.
she
has
been
disabled
from
birth
as
the
record
reflects
and
as
the
social
security
administration
admitted.
under
an
old
line
of
reasoning
going
to
back
to
dandridge,
this
classification
simply
is
not
rationally
based
on
examination
of
more
recent
cases
of
this
court,
jimenez
vs.
weinberger
and
mathews
vs.
lucas,
this
discrimination
becomes
apparent.
this
discrimination
under
jimenez
vs.
weinberger
is
clear.
in
the
jimenez
case,
this
court
examined
a
presumption
in
the
social
security
legislation
which
required
some
illegitimate
--
which
denied
illegitimate
children,
some
illegitimate
children
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
while
other
illegitimate
children
and
legitimate
children
under
that
act
were
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
eligibility.
i
think
this
case
was
the
origin
of
the
over-inclusive,
under-inclusive
language
which
has
sometimes
been
referred
to
by
this
court.
at
any
rate
under
the
jimenez
opinion,
this
court
reversed
a
lower
court
decision
which
had
stated
that
this
presumption
was
alright.
since
it
was
intended
to
avoid
various
claims
and
this
court
clearly
said,
it
is
not
as
described
by
the
fifth
amendment.
why,
because
it
is
irrational,
because
it
is
invidious,
because
the
fifth
amendment
has
teeth,
because
sometimes
the
government,
maybe
not
intentionally,
i
am
sure
not
with
an
intent,
no
one
sat
down
and
said,
we
are
going
to
nail
john
jobst,
this
guy
ought
to
receive
welfare,
but
nevertheless
by
affect
that
discrimination
is
invidious.
it
is
not
rationally
related.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
yes,
he
would
be
precisely,
he
would
be
precisely
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
social
security
recipient,
who
marries
another
recipient.
mr.
j.
d.
riffel
no
sir,
it
is
the
identical
test
applied
in
any
social
security
case,
your
honor.
under
the
later
case
of
mathews
vs.
lucas,
this
court
sustained
a
similar
administrative
aid.
why,
because
it
gave
some
chance
for
those
illegitimate
children
to
come
in
and
prove
they
were
still
dependent.
therefore,
it
was
reasonably
related
to
the
legislative
purpose
and
could
be
sustained.
in
this
case,
we
submit
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
