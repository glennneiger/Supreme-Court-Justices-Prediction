per
month.
unknown
speaker
the
court
has
past
emphasized
the
importance
of
not
thinking
in
stereotypes
in
this
area,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
stereotypical
picture
is
a
husband
supporting
his
wife.
unknown
speaker
the
argument
is
that
it’s
constitutionally
under-inclusive,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it’s
unconstitutional
because
it
is
under
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
not
to
include
the
--
unknown
speaker
this
does
deter
marriage
i
would
suppose;
i
mean
the
general
marriage
rule
would
deter
marriage,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
do
not
think
that
you
need
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
validity
of
your
general
marriage
rule
or
your
disqualification
of
marriage.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is,
no
you
do
not
need
to
pay
any
attention
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well
i
suppose
a
state
law
that
permits
a
minor
to
renounce
his
contract
so
long
as
he
is
under
the
age
of
minority
or
not
married,
might
be
said
that
they
deter
marriage
too.
unknown
speaker
but
you
might
have
some
trouble.
unknown
speaker
well
you
certainly
given
up
attention
in
the
brief
to
the
validity
of
your
underlying
marriage
rule.
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say,
he
was
never
married.
unknown
speaker
mr.
urbanczyk,
is
the
ssi
program
relevant
to
your
constitutional
argument
at
all.
i
do
not
understand
it
to
be,
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
but,
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
ssi
program
be
adapted
in
order
to
save
this
particular
statute
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
mr.
riffel
could
i
interrupt
you,
is
it
really
quite
correct
to
say
that
the
statute
makes
the
classification
you
describe,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
places
people
who
marry
totally
disabled
non-recipients
in
a
special
category.
it’s
a
broader
category
of
which
they
are
a
part.
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well
it
refers
it
creates
the
b
class
for
those
who
marry
totally
disabled
dependents
who
are
covered,
but
there
is
no
classification
in
the
statute
of
persons
who
marry
totally
disabled
spouses
who
are
not
receiving
benefits.
it’s
these
people
who
marry
anyone
who
is
not
receiving
benefits.
is
it
not
the
classification?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
is
line
the
statute
draws.
you
are
saying
within
that
broad
category
there
is
the
smaller
category.
unknown
speaker
and
your
submission
is
that
the
district
court's
decision
should
not
be
understood
to
affect
the
validity
of
the
general
provision
of
social
security
act
and
that
would
terminate
benefits
for
a
beneficiary
of
the
category
under
which
your
client
falls,
who
marries
a
wage
earner
or
anybody
else
who
is
just
simply
not
disabled.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
it
does
make
it
rather
narrow.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court's
the
constitutional
decision
was
made
in
january
of
1974,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
before
our
decision
in
weinberger,
before
our
decision
in
lucas,
and
before
our
decision
in
de
castro.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
the
language
of
congress
one
of
the
best
evidences
of
the
purpose
that
it
had
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
and
here
the
statute
itself
clearly
bars
your
client,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
the
legislative
history
is
contrary
to
the
statutory
language
that
bars
your
client?
unknown
speaker
which
do
you
take,
the
express
legislative
language
or
legislative
history
in
a
case
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well
the
question
is
whether
what
the
statute
says
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
you
go
to
the
legislative
history
only
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
only
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
would,
you
and
i
could
agree
that
there
might
be
many
such
people,
who
after
they
are
18
year
old,
still
have
the
same
needs,
still
of
dependency,
non-disabled
children
of
a
deceased
wage
earner
lose
their
benefits
when
there
is
secondary
benefits,
when
they
reach
the
age
of
18
and
are
still
students
but
i
suppose
you
and
i
could
agree
that
many
people
over
18
are
in
the
same
economic
position
after
their
18th
birthday
one
day
as
they
were
one
day
before
their
18th
birthday.
unknown
speaker
a
birthday
terminates
an
event.
unknown
speaker
well
the
statute
provides
they
must
have
been
disabled
before
the
death,
disability
of
the
wage
earner,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
anytime
before
age
18.
unknown
speaker
mr.
riffel,
you
started
out
by
emphasizing
the
narrowness
of
the
district
court
holding,
why
would
not
the
district
court's
reasoning
apply
equally
to
widower
situation?
assume
your
client
were
a
widower,
who
was
drawing
benefits,
and
married
first
in
one
case,
a
person
who
was
getting
benefits
then
his
benefits
would
continue.
in
the
other
case,
married
someone
who
had
cerebral
palsy
and
was
not
receiving
benefits
and
not
able
to
support
the
widower.
the
benefit
will
terminate
and
would
it
not
be
equally
invalid
under
your
reasoning
within
the
stay.
that
termination
would
be
equally
subject
to
challenge.
unknown
speaker
or
may
be
not
a
disabled
person;
may
be
just
an
older
person
who
is
not
able
to
--
who
was
too
old
to
get
a
job
and
support
her
or
support
him.
i
mean
it
is
we
are
talking
about
a
man
losing
his
benefit,
he
could
very
often
marry
a
person
of
his
own
age
who
is
unable
to
get
a
job
to
support
him
but
yet
is
not
covered
by
the
act.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
constitutional
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
one
before
us?
i
do
not
quite
follow
why
you
would
not
apply
the
same
reasoning
in
both
cases?
unknown
speaker
whichever
way
you
come
out
that
is--
unknown
speaker
my
hypothesis,
my
other
example
is
one
where
the
person
is
just
getting
the
secondary
benefit.
by
hypothesis,
it
is
not
a
person
who
has
got
the
social
security
benefit
out
on
the
basis
of
his
own
earnings.
so
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
even
then
they
are
the
same
statement
in
the
statute
as
to
widowers
who
marry
covered
spouses,
isn't
it
exactly
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well
but
that--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
in
all
of
these
secondary
benefits
situations
if
the
person,
who
is
covered,
marries
another
person
who
is
covered,
benefits
of
both
continue,
but
that
is
the
overall
effect
of
the
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
and
then
that
is
why
i
suggested
that
two
cases
really
are
quite
parallel
and
maybe
it
does
not
mean
you
are
necessarily
wrong,
the
only
thing
i
question
is
whether
the
holding
is
quite
as
narrow
as
you
describe
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
riffel,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
court's
relief?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
court's
order
the
test
of
entitlement
of
your
client
is
whether
his
spouse
was
disabled,
so
that
even
if
your
spouse
was
disabled
but
not
needy,
say
she
was
a
wealthy
person
and
had
independent
means
nevertheless
he
would
recover,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
under
the
court's
holding,
the
test
is
not
one
of
need.
