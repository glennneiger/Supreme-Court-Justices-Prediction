unknown
speaker
mr.
weiss,
could
i
ask
one
question?
your
client
could
not
change
his
status
in
time
to
qualify,
but
this
is
a
class
action,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now
is
the
class
limited
to
plaintiffs
who
could
not
change
their
status
because
of
the
age
qualification
or
does
it
apply
to
all
aliens?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weiss,
you
really
are
speaking
only
of
the
resident
legal
aliens,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
secondly,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
so-called
new
york
state
troopers.
as
i
understand
that
if
that
is
divided
into
three
separate
departments,
the
one
assigned
by
the
governor
and
so
forth
and
the
other
one
highway
petrol
officers
and
then
third,
the
civilian
guard
detective
forces
or
cid
or
something.
would
your
case
be
any
different,
would
you
be
here,
if
we
were
concerned
only
with
the
new
york
city
police
department,
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
this
because
you
have
referred
to
a
class
as
policeman,
that
for
some
reason,
viz-a-viz,
a
the
municipal
reaction
rather
than
a
state
reaction.
so
you
make
the
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
lastly,
in
new
york
state
there
is
a
permit
to
carry
a
gun
under
certain
circumstances
obtainable?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
restricted
citizens
or
aliens
also
there?
unknown
speaker
you
have
so
new
york
statutes
that
restrict
everything
to
citizens
i
wonder.
unknown
speaker
do
aliens
have
the
right
to
leave
the
united
states
without
a
passport?
i
suppose,
i
have
a
passport
from
my
alien
country.
unknown
speaker
permission
from
the
council.
unknown
speaker
if
an
english
alien
for
example
wishes
to
go
back
to
england
for
a
holiday,
does
he
have
to
get
permission
from
anyone?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand
is
it
not
a
member
of
your
group
expected
to
excel
and
to
go
up
a
scale
on
the
hierarchy,
perhaps
the
for
long,
he
might
be
a
captain
or
a
major
whatever
you
call
him
and
we
observed
exercising
in
a
lot
more
policy
decisions.
unknown
speaker
ms.
gordon,
can
i
ask
one
question
about
the
qualification.
unknown
speaker
age
29
is
the
minimum
or
the
maximum
age
at
which
at
which
you
can
become
a
state
policeman
or
get
on
the
list
of
those
who
can
work
up
and
become
a
citizen.
unknown
speaker
or
he
has
to
join
the
army
in
the
meantime.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
discretionary
even
though
he
would
not
not
on
the
list.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
gordan,
you
said
the
state
has
made
him
as
a
public
officer.
what
follows
from
that
is
there
a
definition
somewhere
in
the
constitution
of
the
new
york
or
elsewhere
as
what
follows
from
being
a
public
officer?
unknown
speaker
tied
to
somehow
to
the
definition
of
new
york
state.
unknown
speaker
tied
this
on
how
its
to
the
definition
of
new
york
state.
unknown
speaker
ms.
gordon
i
take
it.
i
am
repeating
my
question
now
here,
opposition.
if
we
were
concerned
here
with
the
new
york
city
police
department,
you
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
the
statutes
or
whatever
it
is
that
govern
the
new
york
city
police
department
require
that
officers
be
citizens.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
do
--
would
you
do
the
same
thing
or
the
two
man
police
force
in
small
town
in
up
street
new
york.
unknown
speaker
i
am
very
much
aware
we
do
not
reach
it
in
this
case
but
i
am
trying
to
find
out
the
extent
of
your
argument.
there
are
other
states
that
do
not
have
this
kind
of
a
requirement.
it
is
happen
so.
unknown
speaker
you
know
the
what
the
origin
is
of
this
past
number
of
new
york
statutes
that
describe
citizenship,
for
masseurs,
barbers,
everything
else.
do
you
know
the
historical
basis
for
this.
unknown
speaker
no
i
do
not
think
that
is
responsive
to
my
question.
i
am
asking
if
you
know
they
are
(inaudible)
of
these
many
multiple
new
york
requirements,
and
i
take
the
answer
you
do
not.
unknown
speaker
or
is
that
that
was
true
in
re
griffiths
set
that
unknown
speaker
anomaly
of
it
be
one.
unknown
speaker
what
about
those
state
officers
who
make
the
decision
whether
to
prosecute
or
not?
unknown
speaker
now
what
about
the
decision
to
prosecute.
if
you
got
the
power
to
decide
that
whether
or
not
to
bring
a
criminal
charge
that
could
result
in
life
imprisonment
or
death,
what
about
prosecutors,
may
they
be
aliens
in
your
state?
unknown
speaker
and
judges
are
judges
in
the
--.
