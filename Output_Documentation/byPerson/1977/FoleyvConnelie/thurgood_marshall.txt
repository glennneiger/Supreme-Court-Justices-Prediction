as
to
the
illegal
alien,
is
it
not
true
that
when
he
shows
up
he
will
no
longer
be
an
applicant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
sullivan
law
is
a
felony,
is
it
not?
the
city
has
felonies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
win
you
do
not
worry
about
it
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
why
i
think
you
should
be
gaining.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
gordon,
you
mentioned
a
juror.
are
aliens
allowed
to
serve
on
juror?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
in
a
group,
that
whole
bunch
of
statutes
he
was
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
not
be
do
subject
to
exactly
the
same
examination
than
anybody
else
to
find
out
whether
he
knew
what
the
law
was,
whether
he
knew
how
to
conduct
himself
and
to
whether
he
knew
how
to
act
in
the
name
of
the
state.
would
he
not
have
to
pay
the
exact
same
examination.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
passed
it
and
he
was
there
on
the
list
he
could
not
get
the
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
were
they
strangers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
pay
the
same
tax
as
you
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
live
right
next
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
goes
to
school
with
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
gordon,
your
answer
to
my
brother
blackmun's
question
suggest
that
you
necessarily
be
dealing
with
the
total
of
50
state
police
forces
similar
to
new
york
with
respect
to
alien
requirements.
i
know
of
my
own
home
state
of
arizona
which
is
vigorously
eschewed
the
idea
of
any
sort
of
a
state
police
force.
they
have
a
state
highway
patrol
which
simply
enforces
traffic
offenses
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are
other
states
like
that
too.
so
that
you
do
not
have
50
states
who
have
a
state
police
force
like
new
york.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
also
apply
to
70%
of
the
elector
who
do
not
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
an
alien
can
make
a
citizens
arrest?
