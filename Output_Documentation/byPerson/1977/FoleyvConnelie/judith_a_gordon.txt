ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
for
determination
on
this
appeal
is
where
the
permanent
resident
aliens
may
be
excluded
from
membership,
this
one
officer
status
of
the
new
york
state
police
under
new
york
executive
law
section
215
(3)
consistently
with
the
aliens
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
contrary
to
the
suggestions
in
appellants
brief
in
portion
of
his
argument
here
today,
there
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
aliens
who
are
in
the
alleged
dilemma
of
being
caught
between
the
federal
five-year
durational
residence
requirement
for
naturalization
and
the
generally
applicable
29-year-old
age
requirement
for
appointment
to
the
state
police.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
there
is
no
such
issue
your
honor
and
that
is
for
the
reason
that
the
case
was
brought
as
a
class
action
of
all
permanent
resident
aliens,
and
i
should
note
here
your
honor
that
of
course
there
is
no
issue
with
respect
to
any
other
types
of
aliens,
temporary
resident
aliens
or
illegal
aliens.
in
any
event,
the
class
as
defined
and
stipulated
too
by
appellant
is
of
all
permanent
resident
aliens
who
but
for
the
citizenship
limitation
in
section
215
(3)
would
be
eligible
to
apply
for
position
with
the
state
police
for
membership
in
the
state
police.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor
and
that
is
the
class
essentially
as
i
have
given
it
to
you
and
it
appears
in
the
district
court
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
at
pages
a
3-4
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdiction
of
statement.
there
is
of
course
no
reference
in
that
definition
of
the
class
to
the
subjective
expectations
of
the
individuals
involved
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
want
to
become
citizens,
likewise,
there
is
no
reference
in
that
class
action
order
to
the
probably
or
improbable
likelihood
of
the
frustration
of
those
expectations
assuming
that
the
individuals
had
them
by
the
operation
of
the
general
age
requirement.
now
the
record
below
in
addition
does
not
support
any
such
alleged
dilemma,
the
age
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
is
a
3through
4
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
your
honor
i
would
call
to
your
attention
that
in
this
case,
the
opinions
are
contained
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statements
and
that
the
appendix
filed
on
this
appeal
the
beiges
copy
has
some
documents
of
records
that
were
not
previously
filed
thought.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor
i
think
that
it
expressly
implied
and
the
--
i
am
just
trying
to
find
the
original
stipulation
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
if
your
honor
looks
at
the
beiges
appendix
d22.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
right.
the
older
page
is
in
the
beiges
appendix,
d
page,
it
is
in
the
page
22
your
honor
will
find
the
stipulations
awarded
by
judge
pollock
which
defines
the
class
as
consisting
of
all
permanent
resident
aliens
who
but
for
the
enforcement
of
new
york
executive
law
215
(3)
would
otherwise
be
eligible
to
compete
for
employment
as
a
state
trooper.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
and
that
they
are
not
temporary
aliens,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
right,
and
as
i
was
just
indicating
to
you
because
the
age
of
the
appellant
was
not
raised
below,
because
his
entering
status
was
not
raised
below
and
it
was
the
date
of
his
permanent
resident
status
was
not
raised
below,
there
was
no
dilemma
hypothicated
before
the
district
court
--
and
obviously
the
district
court
majority
so
proceeded
in
fact
if
you
look
at
judge
mansfield's
dissent,
you
will
find
the
reference
to
the
alleged
dilemma
footnoted
in
his
opinion
as
a
point
raised
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
before
that
court
after
the
case
was
--.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
and
this
class,
in
other
words
there
was
no
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
might
very
well
includes
some
in
that
dilemma
but
the
dilemma,
the
specific
one
that
appellant
seeks
to
argue
even
if
you
concede
him
the
facts
that
he
now
alleges
in
his
reply
brief
namely
that
he
cured
a
permanent
resident
status
in
1974
and
that
he
will
be
30
years
old
in
1980
he
now
alleges.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
it
would.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
if
that
might
be
so
except
with
respect
to
this
named
plaintiff
it
is
not
so
because
based
on
his
new
facts
as
alleged
since
he
will
not
to
be
30
until
1980
and
since
he
can
become
citizen
in
1979,
he
could
be
fully
qualified
to
compete
in
the
next
examination
series,
that
is
the
point.
that
is
our
point
on
that
with
respect
to
that
issue.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
if
that
is
the
issue
your
honor
it
would
become
--
there
would
be
a
problem
with
the
breadth
of
the
class
certification
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
class
certification
cannot
be
modified
to
admit
of
what
are
essentially
new
allegations
by
the
plaintiff.
however,
i
think
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
for
me
to
quite
understand
the
force
of
the
appellant's
argument
with
respect
to
the
alleged
dilemma.
if
plaintiff
were
actually
in
a
dilemma
it
would
connote
that
he
wanted
to
become
a
citizen.
the
distinction
that
he
is
--
that
appellant
has
attempted
to
draw
throughout
this
litigation
is
that
aliens
qua
aliens
are
excluded
and
that
is
the
kind
of
distinction
that
was
made
in
dougall,
the
kind
of
distinction
that
was
made
in
griffiths
and
indeed
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
determined
the
issue.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
would
seem
that
the
court
would
have
to
avoid
it
your
honor
except
that
i
think.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
you
would
obviously
have
to
--
it
was
my
view
your
honor
that
you
could
not
change
the
class
certification
and
the
class
certification
framed
the
issue
in
the
case
and
accordingly
this
dilemma
was
not
reached.
if
the
class
action
certification
had
to
be
modified
and
frankly
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
necessary
for
the
determination
of
this
case
because
since
mr.
justice
stewart
points
that
there
are
bound
to
be
some
individuals,
this
dilemma
is
illustrative
of
some
potential
class
members
but
if
the
certification
were
to
be
modified
it
would
seem
that
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
technically
your
honor
29
would
be
the
age,
29
to
the
30th
year
would
be
the
age
for
appointment
from
the
list.
however,
the
statute
215(3)
in
which
that
limitation
is
incorporated
provides
a
discretion
to
the
superintendent
to
extend
the
maximum
age
to
35
and
indeed
it
makes
mandatory
for
up
to
six
years,
extensions
by
virtue
of
the
performance
of
military
service
and
that
is
another
aspect
which
we
indicate
in
our
brief
would
relieve
petitioner
appellant
of
his
dilemma.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
oh
yes,
that
is
one
thing
he
could
do
your
honor
but
he
could
also
--
i
mean
it
would
be
frivolous
to
think
your
honor
that
had
appellant
pursued
in
a
reasonable
course,
his
application
for
citizenship
and
had
he
taken
the
test
and
the
time
came
for
appointment
and
he
was
20
about
to
be
31
but
could
not
be
naturalized
because
of
the
former
proceedings
which
are
insurgent
to
that.
in
other
words,
he
was
waiting
to
take
his
oath
before
a
federal
officer.
it
would
be
frivolous
to
think
that
the
superintendent
would
not
extend
his
time
since
he
can
extend
the
age
up
to
35
to
accommodate
what
--
were
delays
not
within
the
control
of
the
appellant.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
is
discretionary
your
honor,
yes.
your
honors,
a
state
at
sovereign
because
it
both
creates
and
enforces
its
own
laws.
a
state
police
officer
perform
sovereign
functions
in
new
york
because
he
in
fact
enforces
new
york
laws.
his
powers
to
arrest
throughout
the
state
on
his
own
initiative
for
all
crimes
and
offenses.
his
power
to
use
force
including
deadly
force.
his
power
to
search.
his
power
to
stop
and
frisk
and
to
issue
commands
to
the
general
population
which
must
be
obeyed
which
cannot
be
resisted
by
force
are
extraordinary
and
are
unique
to
his
office.
if
the
officer
exercises
these
powers
his
acts
result
in
the
forcible
detention
of
an
individual
and
the
seizure
of
private
property.
in
addition,
his
acts
result
in
the
initiation
of
the
criminal
justice
process.
if
he
does
not
arrest
the
officer
has
like
the
juror
at
a
criminal
trial
acquitted
a
potential
defendant
on
facts
which
in
the
judgment
of
another
might
constitute
a
crime
or
arrest.
a
police
officer
must
decide
which
course
of
action
to
follow
and
he
alone
is
responsible
for
his
actions.
if
his
judgment
is
questioned
he
is
entitled
to
a
defense
only
of
the
reasonableness
of
his
acts
and
are
judged
on
the
existing
circumstances
at
the
time
his
act
took
place
and
questioned.
he
cannot
rely
on
superior
orders
and
he
has
no
such
defense
under
new
york
state
law.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no
your
honor
aliens
are
not
allowed
to
serve
on.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
these
quitted
aliens
are
not
--
cannot
be
grand
or
petty
federal
jurors
or
grand
to
our
petty
state
jurors,
the
court
recently
affirmed
perkins
versus
smith
involving
the
state
court
juror
which
had
a
citizenship
requirement.
the
state
police
officer
not
only
performs
a
governmental
function
when
he
protects
and
prevents
crimes
against
private
persons
and
property,
but
he
performs
specific
functions
in
aid
of
the
preservation
of
the
state
itself
as
a
political
entity.
he
must
guard
against
civil
disorder,
insurrection,
subversion
and
breach
of
state
security.
he
guide
for
the
life
of
the
chief
executive
and
all
the
dignitaries
in
the
state.
in
light
of
the
importance
of
his
functions
and
his
identification
with
government,
new
york
has
designated
him
as
a
public
officer
since
approximately
since
exactly
1917,
when
the
state
police
were
created.
now
appellant
does
not
dispute
that
the
powers
we
have
just
described
are
in
fact
the
powers
exercised
by
police.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
it
is
of
some
interest
your
honor
that
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dougall
versus
sugarman,
the
court
adapted
a
formulation
of
public
officer
which
as
new
york
state
formulation
public
officer.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
pardon
me.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
well
in
new
york
state,
a
public
officer
is
one
who
exercises
a
portion
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
that
is
he
is
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
law,
the
enforcement
of
the
law
or
like
a
judge
in
the
interpretation
of
the
law.
now
as
a
historical
matter,
categories
of
public
officers
have
eventuated
in
new
york
essentially
by
accretion
other
than
in
the
common
law
tradition,
other
than
the
few
public
office
that
are
maybe
designated
in
the
constitution
or
by
statute
and
the
individual
police
officer,
the
state
police
officer
is
specifically
designated
to
be
that
public
officer
because
of
these
powers
which
invoke
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
your
honor.
he
is
in
fact
the
embodiment
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
when
the
officer
pulls
you
over
to
the
side,
i
think
better
to
look
at
this
way
your
honor.
the
response
of
the
individual
on
a
society
to
the
officers
command
whether
it
is
in
the
arrest
or
whether
it
is
obedience
to
an
order
that
he
may
give
to
a
crowd
or
whether
it
is
because
he
pulls
you
over
to
the
side
of
the
road,
that
response,
that
obedience
is
given
to
him
because
he
is
in
these
set
of
circumstances,
the
embodiment
of
the
law,
in
that
sense
he
is
the
sovereign
and
in
that
sense
his
order
shall
be
obeyed.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely
your
honor
and
that
is
one
of
our
points
here
because
for
example,
it
is
only
the
judge
at
a
criminal
trial
who
is
both
interpreter
of
the
low
and
triar
of
fact,
who
exercises
the
complete
panoply
of
incidents
that
the
police
officer
exercises.
his
functions,
the
police
officers
functions
are
discretionary
because
given
the
law,
he
must
interpret
it
and
he
must
apply
it
to
the
facts.
his
guidelines,
if
you
will
in
that
respect
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
criminal
court
judge
and
indeed
less
complete
than
the
juror
because
the
juror
functions
under
instructions
and
charges
given
to
him
by
the
judge
and
indeed
less
complete
than
the
grand
juror
who
functions
under
judicial
advise
and
prosecutorial
effect.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
what
is
spelled
out
in
fourth
amendment.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor
but
this.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
guidelines
are
no
more
spelled
out
for
the
police
officer
than
they
are
for
the
judge
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
quintessence
of
it.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor.
he
would
have
to
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
your
honor
because
the
preeminent
concern
here
your
honor
is
whether
the
state
when
it
seeks
to
enforce
its
sovereign
powers
shall
have
the
choice
of
selecting
from
members
of
its
own
political
community
or
whether
it
shall
be
compelled
to
select
from
members
who
are
strangers
to
that
community
and
who
are
members
of
another
sovereign
community.
it
is
a
question
of
--.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
because
by
definition
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
they
are
--.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor
i
think
that
is
correct
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
exact
limitation
to
which
i
would
go.
for
example,
state
police
officers
are
said
to
perform
the
highest
law
enforcement
function
because
of
their
statewide
jurisdiction
but
they
do
enforce
all
of
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
well
as
some
other
criminal
statutes.
a
police
officer
in
a
metropolitan
police
district
while
his
geographic
area
would
be
narrower
equally
enforces
the
full
panoply
of
the
penal
law
within
that
jurisdiction.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
first
of
all
your
honor,
the
administrative
code
of
the
city
of
new
york
does
in
fact
require
police
officers
of
the
city
of
new
york
to
be
citizens
and
there
was
a
case
pending
called
franko
versus
bronstein
(ph)
on
that
issue
in
the
state
courts
at
the
moment.
i
would
argue
that
the
limitation
would
be
applied
in
this
way.
to
the
extent
that
the
officer
has
full
powers
of
arrest
and
must
make
judgments
with
respect
to
the
broad
guidelines
such
as
are
encompassed
in
the
penal
law.
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
be
a
appropriate
person
--
he
would
define
a
class
of
positions
from
which
aliens
can
be
excluded,
although,
we
do
not
of
course,
necessarily
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
his
powers
of
arrest,
his
powers
of
search.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well
that
is
an
open
somewhat
question
your
honor.
we
performed
a
survey
at
the
request
of
the
court
and
it
appears
that
at
least
34
states
have
the
requirement.
the
original
29
listed
by
in
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court
plus
new
york
and
california
which
were
not
included
plus
several
other
states
which
operate
by
regulation,
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
balance
of
the
states
do
not
have
similar
limitations,
it
is
only
to
say
that
in
the
course
of
our
endeavors
and
apparently
as
verified
by
the
fbi,
they
were
not
in
statewide
statues.
it
is
of
some
interest
your
honor
to
point
out
that
while
there
would
appear
to
be
some
states
that
do
not
have
that
limitation.
91
percent
of
the
aliens
live
in
states
that
do
in
fact
have
that
limitation
and
accordingly
i
do
not
think
that
we
could
infer
much
from
those
states
which
might
operate
police
departments
without
the
limitation
when
in
fact
their
alien
population
is
so
small
as
to
not
have
a
particular
impact.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
i
had
occasion
to
review
most
of
those
statutes
following
this
court's
opinion
in
dougall
versus
sugarman
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
their
backgrounds
are
various
and
that
they
are
variously
justifiable.
this
particular
statute
that
we
are
concerned
with
is
it
seems
to
me
a
common
sense
matter
of
history
and
tradition.
new
york
state
has
always
required
its
police
officers
to
be
citizens
and
i
believe
that
the
support
for
that
comes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
do
not
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes
that
is
certainly
the
case
and
certainly
the
traditional
local
police
forces
in
the
state
naturally
goes
back
much
further
and
it
is
quite
apparent,
the
city
of
new
york
for
example,
i
think
much
predates.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no
not
that
i
am
aware
of
in
the
form
of
sense
that
we
have
talked
about
it.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
and
for
example,
california
which
does
require
citizenship
for
its
state
police
officers,
apparently
does
not
require
citizenship
for
its
state
highway
patrol
and
possible
elaboration
of
mr.
blackmun's
comment
before
the
division
of
new
york
police
is
not
divided
into
a
highway
patrol,
a
specialized
division
covering
more
significant
matters
in
a
uniform
force.
it
is
one
division
encompassing
three
functional
units,
namely
the
uniform
force
which
provides
a
first
line
response
and
it
consist
of
officers
who
go
out
and
arrest
and
search
and
perform
all
the
functions
we
have
discussed.
one
of
those
units
is
a
through
way
patrol
unit
but
its
functions
are
not
limited
to
giving
tickets
on
the
new
york
state
through
way,
rather
it
has
the
criminal
jurisdiction
for
that
through
way
and
it
arrests
and
searches
and
may
stop
and
give
highway
tickets
but
performs
all
functions
of
enforcement
within
that
geographical
area.
on
addition,
i
would
comment
that
while
the
bci,
the
bureau
of
criminal
investigation
is
a
plain
close
unit
and
it
does
have
a
specific
state
security
function,
its
powers
and
it
is
pursuit
of
its
investigations.
in
other
words,
the
exercise
of
its
powers
in
the
pursuit
of
its
investigation
is
no
different
than
the
response
required
of
the
uniform
officer
who
makes
up
the
uniform
force.
one
last
aspect
on
that
would
be
that
the
governance
detail
perhaps
akin
to
the
secret
service
of
the
united
states
is
itself
a
branch
consisting
essentially
of
uniform
officers
with
several
bci
personnel.
so
that
there
is
no
allocation
of
higher
and
lower
functions
within
these
three
essentially
functional
units
of
that
department.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
now
it
seems
to
me
regardless
of
the
outcome
in
this
case
that
new
york
would
be
able
to
keep
aliens
off
of
juries
as
it--
that
has
a
law
on
that
point
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
perkins
versus
smith.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mbut
it
calls,
i
was
just
to
going
to
say
that
your
honor,
it
calls
into
very
serious
question,
the
basis
for
making
analytical
distinctions
within
governmental
offices.
for
example,
if
as
this
court
has
at
least
impliedly
held
in
its
held
in
its
prior
decisions,
voting
and
legislating
can
be
functions
consigned
to
citizens,
even
though
the
voter
is
remote
from
the
law
making
process
himself
and
his
vote
maybe
one
in
millions
in
any
given
state
or
general
election.
one
to
hold
for
the
appellant
it
would
appear
to
me,
one
would
have
to
find
that
the
police
officers
exercises
for
these
extraordinary
powers
of
his
arrest
and
search,
of
his
use
of
force,
indeed,
deadly
forces
power
over
life
and
death
of
any
individual
on
the
society,
in
the
name
of
state
is
somehow
less
important
that
that
voter's
vote.
i
do
not
think
that
that
can
possibly
the
--
an
analytically
sound
distinction
and
accordingly
it
would
appear
to
me
as
we
have
argued
that
once
we
determine
that
the
juror
performs
a
governmental
office
such
that
citizenship
maybe
required
of
him,
we
then
must
likewise
find
that
the
police
officer
similarly
performs
functions
of
significant
and
governmental
nature
such
that
his
class
may
likewise
be
close
to
aliens.
i
think
by
the
way
that
this
is
one
of
the
force
of
the
dissent
below.
the
dissent
characteristics
voting
and
legislating
as
political.
it
eschews
the
same
characterization
obviously
for
the
police
force
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
distinction
again
can
be
made
because
in
a
government
of
three
equal
branches,
we
cannot
designate
voting
especially
under
the
circumstances
as
i
outlined,
where
it
may
have
very
little,
if
any
potential
ramification
as
more
important
that
law
enforcement.
law
and
enforcement
as
we
designated
as
more
important
then
are
the
judicial
function
of
interpreting
the
law
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
erroneous
assumptions
that
the
dissent
below
makes.
i
would
say,
several
other
points
with
respect
to
that
dissent
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
issue
raised
by
justice
mansfield
and
i
think
briefly
by
justice
marshall
before,
that
is
aside
from
the
designation
of
a
class
of
officer
holders
is
there
anything
about
the
alien
by
virtue
of
his
status
which
makes
him
peculiarly
unsuitable
to
perform
the
functions
of
police
and
while
we
all
urge
this
is
a
secondary
matter.
we
believe
that
there
are
in
fact
such
situations.
for
example,
the
alien
cannot
vote.
to
call
upon
him
then
for
the
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
law,
laws
which
he
has
no
voice
in
creating
would
appear
to
be
egregiously
anomalous.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
true.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
s
true
except
we
do
not
ordinarily
consider
the
attorney
qua
attorney
as
a
law
enforcer.
he
may
appear
and
for
that
reason
he
is
not
an
officer.
certain
attorneys
may
indeed
the
governmental
officers
but
not
all.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
it
is
the
capacity
to
be
able
to
vote
rather
than
that
is
an
issue
and
aliens
are
incapacitate
from
doing
so.
in
addition
it
is
a
illustrative.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
may
very
well
be
one
example
of
the
attorney
who
was
a
governmental
officer
but
i
do
not
think
the
attorney's,
the
prosecutor's
decision
not
to
prosecute
in
a
case,
seemingly
is
akin
to
the
police
officers
decision
not
to
arrest
and
accordingly
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
prosecution
--.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
issue
was
not
yet
been
presented
but
it
would
seem
to
me
your
honor
that
one
could
fairly
argue
that
they
should
that
that
should
class
should
be
limited
to
citizens
because
that
power
to
--
use
of
the
coercive
of
power
of
the
state
which
is
what
the
prosecutor
does
when
he
seeks
indictment
or
files
any
information
would
seem
to
me
to
governmental
and
arguably
limited
to
citizens,
however
the
police
--.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
judges
are
by
law
both
federal
and
state
law
your
honor,
public
officers
and
are
limited
to
citizens.
however,
i
would
call
to
your
honor's
attention
that
while
the
prosecutors
functions
are
drastic,
perhaps
the
police
officer's
functions
are
even
more
drastic.
we
do
not
normally
have
the
situation
where
prosecutor
must
make
an
assessment
as
to
how
much
force
or
deadly
force
to
use
in
a
given
situation.
the
state
police
officer
exercises
that
function
because
he
is
indeed
the
representative
of
the
state.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
where
that
is
the
very
activity
or
very
power
that
is
vested
in
the
policeman,
that
is
correct.
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
other
characteristics
which
aliens
have
which
we
believe
make
them
unsuitable
or
those
which
evidence
that
his
citizenship
to
another
sovereign
and
his
subjections
to
the
laws
of
that
sovereign.
for
example,
an
alien
in
the
united
states
maybe
conscripted
by
the
country
of
his
nationality.
however,
in
the
united
states
he
may
plead
treaty
exemption,
he
may
plead
international
law,
he
may
change
his
immigration
status
and
avoid
the
draft
in
military
service
in
the
very
country
who
people
like
appellant
suggest
have
the
laws
which
they
with
to
enforce.
i
think
that
is
sufficient
your
honors.
thank
you.
