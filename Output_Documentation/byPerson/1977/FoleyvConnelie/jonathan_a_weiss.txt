mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
this
case
involves
exclusions
of
all
non-citizens
from
all
jobs
in
the
new
york
state
police
department
as
troopers
etcetera.
by
such
exclusion
various
constitutional
precepts
are
violated.
first,
there
is
a
group
at
consideration.
aliens;
aliens
have
been
considered
by
this
court
and
just
be
so
a
discrete
insular
minority.
they
are
on
one
hand,
vulnerable
because
of
their
peculiar
status,
on
the
other
hand
they
contribute
by
their
presence
here
to
the
country.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
in
that
case
they
were
not
aliens,
they
were
--
you
are
talking
about
footnote
4,
i
take
it.
there
was
any
group
that
could
be
classified
particularly
as
having
specific
characteristics,
it
was
a
generic
classification.
in
this
case,
we
have
what
has
been
characterized
by
this
court
as
an
example
of
that
minority
--
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
do
not
recall
this,
your
honor,
i
do
recall
they
were
not
aliens.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes,
it
is
footnote
4
in
carolene
products.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
no,
i
agree
your
honor,
and
i
was
not
relying
upon
the
footnote
number
4,
carolene
products
but
rather
description.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
that
is
right.
which
differs
back
to
that
and
gives
it
cognitive
content
that
is
the
reference
we
made,
where
the
dispute
as
to
whether
there
is
an
appropriate
reference
back
but
that
is
the
law
concerning
aliens.
these
are
individuals
of
course,
who
have
undergone
federal
scrutiny
here
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
they
can,
they
cannot.
the
question
is,
when
is
that
distinction
important?
in
this
case
for
example,
some
of
the
aliens
cannot
change
their
status
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
and
lead
themselves
of
the
exclusionary
burden.
there
are
others
who
perhaps
could.
so
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
that
is
not
a
functional
distinction
but
it
could
be
a
distinction
that
could
come
into
play
in
other
cases.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
that
is
correct
and
therefore
this
is
a
status
which
he
and
others
like
him
are
unable
to
change.
there
may
be
other
individuals
because
the
category
is
so
broad
that
could
in
fact
change
their
status
and
they
too
would
form
this
rubric
but
that
distinction
could
not
be
made
to
the
purpose
of
this
case,
it
might
be
made
for
different
statutes
and
different
considerations
at
different
times.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
note
what
is
at
stake
here,
what
right
we
are
talking
about
excluding
these
non-citizens
from.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
apply
to
all
aliens
your
honor.
because
that
is
how
the
statute
sweeps
and
that
includes
those
two
if
you
want
possibly
distinguishable
sub-classes,
those
that
can
and
those
that
cannot.
the
right
at
stake
here
is
employment.
this
court
has
consistently
held
and
in
conjunction
with
alien
rights
that
employment
is
a
crucial
right.
in
particular,
this
is
employment
in
a
police
department.
for
whatever
reasons
may
be
evoked
to
justify
such
an
exclusion
it
was
seem
to
frustrate
rather
further
these
purposes.
to
have
an
efficient
police
force
you
want
to
have
the
largest
pool
to
select
from
of
capable
individuals
by
excluding
aliens
whose
contributions
we
welcome
in
other
spheres,
we
cut
down
that
possibility,
we
eliminate
certain
applicants
who
may
be
superior
to
those
who
would
be
accepted
when
you
eliminate
this
group.
in
particular,
since
we
are
a
country,
also
heterogeneity
and
country
traditional
immigrants
and
there
are
large
foreign
speaking
populations.
it
can
even
be
suggested
as
the
amicus
has
that
there
is
a
need
to
go
into
this
pool
of
potential
foreign
speakers
and
people
who
have
so
ability
to
relate
from
time-to-time
petition
to
immigrant
proof.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
would
suggest
they
are,
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
in
the
police
force.
that
was
not
suggested.
the
suggestion
is
that
is
truly
probably
to
recruit
for
particular
skills,
regardless
of
race,
creed
or
color.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
large
spanish
speaking
population
you
might
want
to
recruit
spanish
speaking
policemen
regardless
of
their
race.
if
you
exclude
yourself
or
have
excluded
from
the
pool
a
large
population
which
speaks
spanish
as
well
as
english
you
may
in
fact
illumining
your
ability
to
recruit
able
police
officers
with
this
what
you
are
looking
for.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
amicus
suggestion
may
have
some
validity
that
there
may
be
virtue
even
looking
out
for
aliens
to
respond
to
particular
community
needs.
but
that
in
no
question
the
ultimate
resolution
has
to
be
the
merit
of
the
individual
to
serve
the
police
force,
they
must
pass
those
tests
and
the
more
people
we
have
applying
ability
the
more
likely
we
are
to
have
a
better
group
to
in
fact
carry
out
the
law
enforcement
duties.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
once
again
your
honor
i
am
sure
they
are,
but
not
one
i
think
we
should
have
in
the
police
force.
the
police
force
deals
with
people
who
must
enforce
a
law
and
one
of
the
screening
characteristics
one
should
have
in
police
force,
if
exclude
those
people
who
have
committed
illegal
acts.
we
would
not
want
the
discrete
minority
--
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
well,
the
argument
could
also
be
made
that
for
that
reason
you
have
to
hire
ex-felony
convicts
because
they
have
some
identity
with
the
--
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
no,
what
i
am
suggesting
that
there
are
certain
standards
which
should
be
met.
they
should
include
very
clear
skills
of
handling
weapons,
language
to
understand
the
law,
and
also
i
would
think
a
policeman
should
as
a
servant
of
the
law
expect
to
have
lived
up
to
the
law.
so
anybody
was
painted
by
illegality.
the
issue
is
not
--
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
in
so
far
it
continues
to
commit
a
crime
i
would
think
--
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
would
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case,
in
my
opinion,
it
would
not
because
it
would
merely
be
a
different
plaintiff
for
the
same
class.
we
have
these
two
classes
that
are
covered
by
the
statute,
those
who
cannot
change
their
status
and
those
who
can.
i
also
suggest
that
perhaps
even
for
those
individuals
who
cannot
change
their
status,
the
clear
implications
of
mauclet
that
they
too
would
be
covered
by
this
court's
decision.
particularly,
since
as
your
honor
suggested
in
mauclet,
the
employment
right
is
also
crucial
factor
in
establishing
whether
or
not
some
unconstitutional
discrimination.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
an
applicant
for
deportation
more
likely
than
the
state
police
force.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
would
think
after
dougall
v.
sugarman
the
case
would
be
very
similar.
yes,
i
think
i
still
be
here
in
new
york
city
but
in
new
york
state
because
it
has
the
whole
statewide
applications,
(inaudible)
would
be
probably
a
clear
example
but
i
think
i
have
a
similar
case
in
the
city.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yeah.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
believe
that
--
you
mean
for
private
citizen?
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes,
i
believe
in
both
new
york
state,
new
york
city
is
obtainable.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
well,
new
york
state
as
we
suggested
in
brief,
that
one
period
passed,
a
whole
series
of
aliens
exclusion
and
alien
discrimination
statutes
covering
a
whole
or
i
say
crazy
quilt
of
possibilities.
you
list
some
and
you
do
not
know
about
handguns.
if
the
court
wants
i
can
submit
a
brief
statement
a
couple
of
days
after
argument.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yeah.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes,
i
believe
this
is
new
york
city
ordinance.
my
impression
your
honor
is
fairly
clear
that
it
is
the
city
and
my
counsel
here
agrees
with
me
in
that.
the
new
york
city
sullivan
law
and
prohibits
carrying
handguns,
i
do
not
believe
implies
mistake.
but
i
can
again
clarify
that.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
think
the
sullivan
law
is
a
misdemeanor
but
i
am
not
sure
on
that
but
i
am
pretty
sure
it
is
a
city
law.
i
think
it
is
carrying,
concealed
handguns
and
i
believe
also
it
is
a
registration
thing
in
various
exclusions.
again
i
am
not
familiar
whether
that
has
an
alien
aspect
to
it.
i
think
the
exclusionary
categories
deal
with
a
character
and
past
criminal
convictions
and
the
like.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
believe
that
resident
alien
with
a
green
card
can
--
with
permission
from
the
council
come
and
go
from
the
united
states.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
council
of
the
united
states
i
believe,
you
have
to
notify
them
when
you
are
going
and
coming
back,
which
you
go
out
for
more
than
a
particular
period
of
time,
you
surrender
that
status.
and
therefore
they
have
to
be
notified
that
you
are
leaving
and
we
get
permission.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
i
believe
so,
i
do
not
know.
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
do
know
that
you
have
to
maintain
residence
in
connection
with
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
time
in
order
to
retain
your
green
card.
it
is
our
essential
conceptual
argument
here
that
the
conjunction
of
dougall
v.
sugarman
which
says
you
cannot
exclude
non-citizens
from
public
employment
in
new
york
state.
in
re
griffiths
which
holds
that
you
cannot
prevent
aliens
from
being
lawyers,
combined
make
an
a
fortiori
case
that
you
cannot
exclude
people
who
want
to
apply
for
various
law
enforcement
jobs.
a
policeman
or
trooper
carries
out
the
law
under
supervision,
under
directions
and
in
conjunction
with
a
whole
paramilitary
organization
has
been
characterized
by
the
state.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
if
it
is
possible
for
policeman
at
the
top
to
exercise
policy
decisions
it
might
be
possible
for
one
of
those
class
eventually
be
considered
for
that
position.
at
that
point
however
i
believe
in
addition
the
head
of
the
new
york
state
police
makes
individual
determinations
as
to
who
should
be
promoted.
so
if
there
were
anything
which
could
conceivably
be
relevant
in
connection
with
the
alien
age,
that
would
then
be
concerned
at
that
time.
but
any
event
this
statute
does
not
speak
to
a
specific
narrow
group
of
possible
policy
makers,
the
new
york
state
police
department,
but
rather
to
every
single
conceivable
applicant
to
the
new
york
state
police
organization.
as
a
consequence,
since
this
is
such
a
broad
exclusion,
it
implies
in
the
face
of
defining
narrowly
who
can
be
excluded
and
for
what
reasons,
since
it
frustrates
the
purposes
of
having
a
police
force
since
it
folds
against
the
whole
line
of
presence
that
this
court
has
issued
and
have
been
generated
by
this
court's
decisions,
we
submit
that
the
exclusion
from
the
state
police
department
for
all
non-citizens
must
be
declared
unconstitutional.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes.
first
as
to
where
there
are
some
police
department
who
do
not
have
the
--
they
have
corrected
and
some
are
mentioned
in
footnote
four,
with
judge
mansfield
dissent.
i
would
just
like
to
focus
briefly
on
the
question
of
sovereignty
and
relationship
to
taking
an
oath
which
we
discussed
in
re
griffiths.
it
should
be
noted
by
the
way
in
passing
that
aliens
who
are
in
the
army
also
serve
the
military
police
there.
so
that
aliens
who
pay
taxes,
who
are
subject
to
draft,
who
protect
the
government
security,
also
protect
the
internal
security
inside
the
army
which
would
seem
to
be
a
fairly
strong
analogy
as
good
as
--.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
no,
i
am
not
suggesting,
i
am
saying
they
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
yes,
but
that
was
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
police
departments
which
in
fact
continued
because
of
the
uniform
policy
across
the
country.
this
is
illustration
of
a
sovereign
united
states,
that
has
chosen
not
to
make
a
exclusions.
the
issue
pertains
to
the
army
but
of
course,
the
much
more
difficult
issues
than
in
this
case,
these
are
both
federal
and
also
national
security
but
in
terms
of
the
congressional
statement
implicitly
as
to
the
reliability
of
aliens
who
served
in
a
police
force
this
would
be
a
fairly
powerful
implication.
the
discretion
that
a
police
officer
has
is
not
a
political
discretion,
it
is
not
a
policy
discretion,
it
is
a
discretion
different
in
function
and
in
nature,
those
acts
and
count
thought
of
in
the
dougall
suggestion.
what
you
have
there
is
political
decisions
to
the
policymaking
sort,
what
you
have
here
are
factual
applications.
it
functions
inside
a
give
framework
rather
than
gives
the
framework.
it
functions
in
terms
of
facts
rather
than
in
terms
of
competing
public
policies.
as
far
as
the
representation
of
a
sovereign
by
a
police
officer,
i
think
it
would
be
demeaning
to
this
profession,
if
we
would
suggest
that
a
police
officer
is
more
of
a
representative
of
the
law,
speaks
more
of
the
law
than
a
lawyer.
a
lawyer
is
an
embodiment
to
the
citizenry
as
all
the
law.
he
speaks
for
the
law
to
the
citizen,
he
speaks
through
the
law.
he
is
an
all
sort
of
the
court.
so
whatever
degree,
there
could
be
some
implication
that
the
sovereign
appearance
of
people
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
exclude
aliens
that
would
apply
much
more
strongly
to
lawyers
than
to
police
officers
and
that
is
a
case
which
this
court
has
already
included
its
opinion.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
they
cannot
but
the
police
officers
cannot
be
no
republics,
file
affirmations
in
court
and
do
the
all
sort
of
things.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
they
would
have
they
have
kind
of
different
status
to
do
it.
they
still
not
be
able
to
make
affirmations.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
would
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
suggest
that
whatever
agree
this
liability
to
the
citizens
arrest,
which
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
anymore
that
a
lawyer
would
not
have
particularly
a
higher
role
in
that
than
anyone
else.
and
that
if
it
is
defined
if
a
citizenship
is,
although
an
alien
could
not.
mr.
jonathan
a.
weiss
i
would
think
not
by
definition.
may
a
residents
arrest.
i
am
not
sure
anybody
could
make
one
but
i
assume
by
definition,
not.
thank
you
very
much.
