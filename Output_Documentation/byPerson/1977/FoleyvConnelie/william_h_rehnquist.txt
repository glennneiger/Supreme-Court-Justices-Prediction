that
was
in
the
carolene
products.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
footnote
was
kind
of
not
necessary
perhaps
to
the
decision
of
that
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
justice
blackmun's
opinion
to
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
of
what
is
called
the
sullivan
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
new
york
city
ordinance
or
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
gordon
this
class
is
a
little
different
at
least
and
it
is
a
little
broader
than
the
one
you
identified,
it
talks
about
the
plaintiff
and
all
other
alien
residents
in
the
state
of
new
york
who
have
applied
or
will
apply
for
the
position
of
state
trooper.
now
that
does
not
talk
about
permanent
resident
aliens
nor
illegal
aliens,
it
sets
all
i
suppose
imply
but
it
is
not
stated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
a3
and
a4
that
is
what
it
says.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
d22?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
all
permanent
resident
aliens
implies
that
they
are
not
illegal
aliens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly
permanent
means
they
are
not
temporary?
it
does
not
mean
they
are
illegal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
class
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
inevitably
include
some
in
that
dilemma.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
class
by
definition
of
those
who
would
otherwise
be
eligible
to
compete
for
employment
would
include
all
resident
aliens
up
to
age
29.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
obviously
would
include
therefore
many
who
could
not
become
nationalized
citizens
before
they
were
too
old
to
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
inevitably
--.
