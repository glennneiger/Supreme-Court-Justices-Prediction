chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-839
foley
against
connelie.
mr.
weiss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
were
the
constituents
in
the
discrete
insular
minority
that
justice
stone
referred
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact
what
were
they
in
justice
stone's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
discrete
insular
group
whether
minority
or
otherwise,
when
they
are
--
let
us
say
american-indians
or
negros
or
women
or
men
who
cannot
change
their
condition,
that
is
one
kind
of
a
discrete
insular
group.
do
you
think
aliens
fit
into
that
kind
of
a
definition
of
the
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
understand
the
record
mr.
foley
could
not
become
a
citizen
in
time
to
meet
the
age
requirement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
aliens
who
cannot
speak
english
are
also
a
discrete
insular
minority
or
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
various
assessments
made
from
time-to-time,
some
governmental
and
some
private
are
that
we
have
from
the
range
of
8
million
to
possibly
as
high
as
12
million
illegal
aliens
in
the
country.
do
you
think,
illegal
aliens
are
discrete
insular
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously
whether
it
is
8
million
or
12
million
or
6
million
obviously
this
is
a
large
group
of
people
who
need
some
attention
from
law
enforcement
people
and
to
pursue
your
theory
this
is
a
--
if
you
went
in
to
the
illegal
aliens
for
policeman,
for
law
enforcement
people
you
would
have
the
group
with
some
compatibility
and
empathy
toward
that
group,
thereby
enlarging
the
pool
as
you
put
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
not
their
argument,
i
am
taking
you,
it
is
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
to
the
points
you
are
making,
if
the
alien
had
been
in
the
country
for
ten
years
and
just
ignored
the
opportunities
to
become
a
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
illegals,
i
am
talking
about
your
man
now.
the
person
in
your
class,
your
client,
if
the
person
had
been
in
the
country
for
ten
years
with
abundant
opportunity
to
become
a
citizen
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
weiss.
ms.
gordon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
there
is
none.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
district
court
certify
a
class
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
page
number
that
you
gave
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
effect
becomes
critical
or
may
there
not
be
some
problem
with
the
breadth
of
the
class
certification.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
what
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
all
though
as
to
aliens
who
fulfill
their
residency
requirement
and
could
becomes
citizens
before
their
29th
birthday,
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
worked
by
the
new
york
statute
as
to
those
in
the
class
that
appellant
alleges
he
is
in,
those
who
can
not
become
citizens
by
their
29th
birthday
there
is
a
discrimination.
what
does
a
court
do
with
the
class
certification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
avoid
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
of
course,
in
making
an
arrest
they
surely
invoke
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
directing
conflicts,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
some
judicial
opinions
i
do
not
recall
them
at
the
moment
which
have
said
even
if
they
were
not
holding
means
that
police
officer
under
breach
exercises
a
broader
discretion
than
a
judge
on
the
bench.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
do
you
think
they
are
all
very
completely
spelled
out
in
our
fourth
amendment
decisions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
guidelines.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
really.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
do
not
prevail
here.
if
your
friend
prevails
and
reverse,
do
you
think
new
york
can
keep
these
aliens
off
of
the
juries.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
do
you
see
no
connection
between
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
voting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
prosecutor
has
no
discretion
to
pull
the
trigger
and
shoot
someone
under
any
circumstances
but
a
policeman
has
it
under
many.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weiss,
do
you
have
any
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
army,
the
military
services
could
not
exclude
aliens
from
military
police
duty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
under
choice
and
discussion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course
lawyers
can
make
arrests
per
se,
can
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
they
might
have,
if
they
became
notorious
public.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
view
of
the
so
called
citizens
arrest
which
has
been
(inaudible)
if
not
our
law,
would
an
alien
not
be
able
to
make
a
citizens
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion

announce
for
the
court
in
foley
against
connelie,
