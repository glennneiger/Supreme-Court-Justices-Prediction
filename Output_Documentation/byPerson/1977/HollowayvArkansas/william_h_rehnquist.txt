justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hall,
as
i
read
the
state
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case,
they
found
there
was
no
prejudice
resulting
from
the
failure
to
appoint
separate
counsel.
do
you
attack
that
finding
or
do
you
say
that
notwithstanding
that
finding
you
are
entitled
to
a
reversal
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
telling
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
you
tell
what
you
have
said
in
response
to
my
question
just
now,
did
you
tell
that
to
make
that
point
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
when
you
were
arguing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can
you
bring
it
out
to
us
in
a
way
that
you
cannot
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
could
not
you
have
done
the
same
thing
in
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
not
orally
argued?
