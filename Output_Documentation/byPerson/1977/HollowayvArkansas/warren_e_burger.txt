chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
76-5856
holloway
against
arkansas.
mr.
hall
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
difference
in
the
general
nature
of
the
defense
as
between
and
among
these
defendants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
make
any
proffer
that
the
witness
was
inherently
a
hostile
witness
and
asked
for
the
cross-examination
under
the
hostile
witness
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
not
necessarily
bar
that
proffer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
an
explanation
of
why
one
witness
might
be
hostile
with
respect
to
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
their
defense
that
they
had
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
it
be
just
a
request
or
a
request
accompanied
by
a
representation
such
as
you
did
make
here
that
there
were
inherent
conflicts
that
would
impair
the
defense
of
each?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
pursuing
mr.
justice
blackmun's
inquiry.
is
it
not
sufficient
for
you
to
persuade
the
court
that
in
these
circumstances
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
after
you
had
represented
that
a
conflict
existed.
you
said
that
you
have
since
then
represented
codefendants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
was
not
that
enough,
if
you
show
a
claim
and
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
to
prevent
you
from
representing
to
the
trial
judge
with
or
without
an
invitation
from
the
trial
judge
exactly
what
you
have
responded
now
without
naming
the
names,
that
stating
precisely
what
you
have
stated
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somebody
will
remember
it
now
if
you
get
a
new
trial
if
you
get
what
you
are
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
to
you
now
was
?
why
could
not
you
make
that
representation
to
the
judge,
but
declined
to
identify
which
person
was
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
so
forth,
just
as
you
have
not
disclosed
that
to
us?
am
i
arguing
to
prevent
you
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
the
role
of
defense
counsel
to
be
bashful
in
presenting
these
points
in
either
this
court
or
a
trial
court,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
referred
to
the
american
bar
standards
on
this
subject.
in
those
standards
is
there
not
also
a
standard
that
if
one
public
defender
in
a
public
defender
office
is
presented
with
the
problem
that
you
had
that
then
none
of
the
members
of
that
same
staff
should
be
on
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
true
in
your
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
for
those
purposes
the
public
defender
staff
is
treated
just
as
though
it
were
a
law
firm?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
purvis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
rule
that
a
court
would
be
obliged
to
accept
the
representation
of
a
member
of
the
bar
if
he
tendered
that
as
a
member
of
the
bar
and
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
that
is
not
enough?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
do
now,
do
we
not,
after
his
representations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
said
that
articulating
the
traditional
rule
about
examining
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
own
witness
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
arkansas
and
the
state
courts
permit
examination
of
a
witness
even
when
the
witness
has
been
called
by
counsel,
if
there
is
some
representation
of
his
being
or
her
being
a
hostile
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
usual
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
arkansas
traditionally
follow
the
rule
followed
in
many
places
that
if
the
client
testifies
falsely
then
counsel,
even
his
own
counsel
was
not
pursue
that
witness
in
anyway,
is
that
accepted
in
arkansas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
recognize
that
at
that
stage
whatever
flaws
there
may
have
been
in
the
conduct
of
the
defense
counsel
in
not
pressing
the
matter
in
the
first
instance,
when
he
got
into
trial
that
he
was
presented
with
an
extremely
difficult
set
of
alternatives,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
was
going
to
try
to
help
the
man
who
was
the
lookout
man
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
presumably
that
is
the
only
man
he
was
primarily
concerned
with.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
may
be
true
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
a
jury
might
have
taken
a
different
view
for
example
and
found
that
the
lookout
man
guilty
of
lesser
charges
than
finding
assessed
with
the
others,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
again
when
these
three
men
had
one
common
counsel,
that
counsel,
the
public
defender
was
in
pretty
difficult
position
to
go
and
negotiate
with
the
prosecutor
for
a
guilty
plea
on
a
lesser
included
offense
for
the
man
at
the
head
of
the
stairs,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
did
not
explore
these
questions
as
extensively
as
they
have
been
explored
here
this
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
not
have
oral
argument,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
he
receive
--
should
it
occur
that
he
would
receive
a
new
trial
now,
i
suppose
some
of
them
may
have
opened
themselves
to
charges
of
perjury
in
their
original
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
it
is
a
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently
not.
mr.
hall
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
for
court
to
announce
in
holloway
against
arkansas
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
is
reversed.
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
