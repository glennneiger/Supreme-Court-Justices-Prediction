justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
i
take
it
insist
that
if
the
attorney
requests
it
that
he
should
be
relieved
of
a
joint
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is,
i
mean,
to
that
extent
it
is
per
se
rule
you
are
submitting?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
contend
that
the
motion
made
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
which
was
a
renewed
motion
was
untimely?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
court
correctly
said
that
the
inability
to
cross
examine
a
codefendant
who
wants
to
testify
is
an
insufficient
reason
for
a
separate
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
your
answer
is
no.
i
mean
the
court
was
told
that
the
defendants
were
going
to
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibility
or
they
got
up
and
said
they
were
going
to
testify
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
is
right.
that
is
when
it
was,
but
you
do
not
say
that
that
motion
was
untimely,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
that
he
just
denied
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
said
that
apparently
the
inability
to
cross-examine
is
insufficient
reason
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
he
did
say
--
the
court
said
--
that
is
alright
that
they
testified.
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest
is
what
the
court
ruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
what
the
contention
is
as
far
as
i
can
say.
he
does
not
ask
that
there
is
any
flat
rule
against
multiple
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
--
you
said
that,
you
attributed
the
same
here
to
your
colleague
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
understand
his
submission
in
that
way.
his
submission
is
that,
that
if
the
attorney
makes
a
representation
that
in
his
view
and
his
professional
judgment
there
is
a
conflict
then
there
should
be
separate
representation,
that
is
not
a
per
se
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
trial
judge
should
be
entitled
to
require
a
counsel
in
supporting
his
judgment
to
reveal
confidential
information
imparted
to
him
by
his
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
answering
my
question?
