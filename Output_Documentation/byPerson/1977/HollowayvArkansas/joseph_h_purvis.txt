mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
arkansas
here
would
submit
that
there
are
really,
but
two
issues.
the
first
is
whether
in
fact
a
conflict
of
interest
did
exist
here,
and
the
second
or
broader
issue
is
if
the
issue
of
conflict
arises
who
bears
the
responsibility
for
making
that
decision.
the
glasser
decision
of
this
court
in
1942
merely
stated
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
was
given
where
an
attorney
was
representing
conflicting
interest
and
the
majority
of
jurisdictions
in
this
country
have
held
that
it
is
not
an
imaginary
conflict
that
is
spoken
off,
but
that
it
must
be
shown
that
there
is
in
fact
some
real
conflict,
something
more
than
a
possibility
of
conflict.
the
state
of
arkansas
submits
that
the
defense
counsel
here
submitted
a
petition
for
separate
counsel
that
stated
merely
that
the
?possibility?
of
conflict
existed.
prior
to
trial,
the
trial
court
held
a
hearing
on
this
motion
in
an
effort
to
ascertain
what
if
any
conflict
existed?
we
are
not
blessed
in
the
record
with
a
transcript
of
that
hearing.
however,
the
court
did
find
at
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
conflict.
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
the
judge
denied
his
motion
for
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
do
not
know
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
that
the
court
elucidated
those
exact
words,
but
the
trial
court
continually
stood
ready
to
hear
evidence
of
some
conflict,
and
there
was
none
that
really
existed
here.
the
defendants
were
not
precluded
any
defense.
they
all
alleged
alibi
defenses
that
were
certainly
not
inconsistent.
they
testified
to
this
effect.
there
is
no
indicia
that
the
defense
counsel
could
not
have
gone
forward
and
made
such
a
proffer.
now,
the
defense
counsel
has
set
forth
some
very
nice
standards
dealing
with
confidentiality
and
lawyer
confidences,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
number
one
-
this
case
in
particular
involved
no
conflict,
that
he
very
easily
could
have
outlined
to
the
trial
court,
the
general
nature
of
the
conflict
and
did
not
have
to
divulge
confidential
information
to
the
court
in
order
to
show
that
a
conflict
existed,
but
apparently
the
defense
counsel
never
made
that
impression
or
conveyed
that
to
the
court
and
the
state
would
certainly
submit
that
there
was
no
conflict
that
existed
here.
counsel
made
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
cross-examine
his
witnesses.
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
the
cross
examination
of
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
had
defense
counsel
done
so,
sir,
he
certainly
would
have
made
a
case
of
conflict
and
he
could
have
merely
outlined
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
he
should
have
gone
to
the
court
when
he
perceived
this
conflict.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
state's
position
that
asking
for
an
early
hearing
and
explaining
this
without
dealing
into
specific
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no
sir,
i
think
he
could
have
gone
to
the
court
and
explained
your
honor,
?i
have
one
of
my
three
clients
who
wishes
to
testify
and
his
defense
is
or
the
essence
of
his
testimony
will
be
totally
antagonistic.
it
will
be
exculpatory
and
it
will
cast
the
shadow
of
doubt
and
try
to
thrust
the
guilt
on
the
other
two.
i
do
not
think
he
is
divorced
or
has
conceded
that
any
or
all
are
guilty.
he
is
merely
spoken
of
what
his
counsel
will
testify
or
what
his
client
will
testify.
i
think
then
if
the
court
knows
this
and
i
think
certainly
here
had
the
trial
court
known
this,
it
would
have
granted
the
motion
for
separate
counsel.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
if
it
develops
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
and
the
state
does
not
refute
the
position
if
at
any
time
during
the
trial
it
can
be
shown
that
a
conflict
actually
exists
then
i
think
the
trial
court
has
the
duty
to
declare
a
mistrial
if
it
is
in
trial
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
arguably,
due
to
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
very
grave
danger
here,
but
i
think
the
court
would
have
no
duty
or
no
choice,
but
to
declare
a
mistrial.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir.
i
simply
think
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
indication,
and
the
court
had
no
indication,
the
court
was
not
advised
as
to
even
the
real
nature
of
the
potential
conflict
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
he
was
told
that
there
was
a
possibility
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
well,
that
was
at
the
closure
of
the
state's
case,
but
the
court
had
no
information
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
not
necessary
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
that
is
right,
because
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
because
the
court
had
no
information
before
that
there
would
be
anything
that
would
be
antagonistic
or
indicative
of
a
conflict
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
based
on
the
information
that
the
court
had
at
the
time
which
was
minuscule
merely
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
trial
court
bears
a
very
grave
responsibility
and
any
such
decision
such
as
this
needs
to
be
made
by
an
independent
authority.
the
state
contends
that
the
burden
for
bringing
up
conflict
of
interests
certainly
lies
with
the
members
of
the
bar,
but
it
is
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
the
trial
judge,
the
impartial
independent
trial
judge
to
receive
the
information
outlining
the
nature
of
the
conflict
and
then
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
conflict
does
in
fact
exist,
if
one
does
exist
then
i
think
the
duty
is
to
appoint
separate
counsel.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir,
but
there
was
nothing.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
he
did
do
that,
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
anything
antagonistic
and
in
fact
their
alibi
defenses
were
entirely
compatible.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir,
but
this
goes
--
the
state
would
contend
again
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
we
do
now
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
think
that
had
defense
counsel
made
the
disclosure
of
this
nature
at
the
motion
hearing,
the
court
would
have
known.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
asked?
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir,
but
we
unfortunately
are
not
blessed
with
the
record
of
them
hearing
on
the
motion.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir
but
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir
and
?
but
we
would
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
indicate
that
the
judge
or
anyone
knew
of
any
reason
why
our
cross-examination
would
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
he
said,
?you
cannot
cross
examine
your
own
witness.?
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
that
is
what
he
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
referring
to
your
honor
because
arkansas
had
not
adopted
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
until
july
01,
1976
which
was
approximately
ten
months
after
this
trial.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
was
no
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes,
sir
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
arkansas
was
operating
under
the
old
traditional
rules
of
evidence
that
unless
you
could
show
or
have
the
court
declare
your
witness
to
be
a
hostile
witness,
you
were
not
entitled
to
cross-examine
your
own
witness.
the
court,
it
is
our
position,
stood
ready
at
all
times
to
receive
sufficient
information
to
let
it
be
able
to
declare
him
a
hostile
witness
and
to
show
that
there
was
a
conflict.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir.
if
that
is
what
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
there
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir,
but
apparently
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
apparently,
we
are
not
given
and
do
not
know
and
certainly
cannot
tell
from
the
record,
what
line
of
defense,
the
defense
would
have
taken.
had
there
been
separate
counsel
or
had
they
even
been
allowed
cross-examination?
there
was
nothing
to
show
any
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir,
but
i
think
in
order
to
do
that
you
have
to
make
a
presumption
that
there
is
a
conflict
which
would
necessitate
or
give
benefit
from
the
cross-examination
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
note
that
such
existed
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor.
i
do
not
?
i
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
of
course
then
to
under
the
arkansas
law
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
instead
of
the
actual
rapist,
would
have
had
no
baring
on
his
guilt
of
the
two
crimes
or
the
two
charges
actually
three
rapes
because
he
was
just
as
guilty
as
those
who
were
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
here
again
we
have
the
--
there
is
no
indication
that
any
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
had
any
or
gave
any
inkling
of
ever
choosing
to
confess
and
turn
state's
evidence
or
admit
to
any
facet
of
this
crime
and
the
state
would
contend
that
were
there
some
indicia
in
the
record
that
one
wish
to
do
so.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir,
but
there
have
been
decisions
from
the
various
circuit
courts
that
hold
merely
because
the
evidence
is
stronger
as
to
one
or
merely
because
the
defense
counsel
is
precluded
one
particular
line
of
questioning
or
defense
that,
that
does
not
necessarily
give
rise
to
a
conflict.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir,
and
i
think
simply
because
the
arkansas
court
did
not
have
the
information
before
it
that
this
court
has.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir
they
did
not.
in
arkansas
oral
argument
is
not
a
matter
of
course.
it
generally
must
be
sought
by
the
party
who
is
the
appellant
or
one
of
the
two
parties,
they
equally
have
the
right
to
do
so,
but
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir
i
did
not
say
that
none
confessed,
but
mr.
campbell
vehemently
denied
making
the
statement,
committing
the
crime
or
ever
having
even
been
in
the
restaurant.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
his
oral
statement,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
that
is
true
sir.
and
then
he
took
the
stand
and
vehemently
denied
as
he
had
done
at
the
denno
hearing
in
previous
room.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
presumably
so
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
it
is
a
possibility,
but
the
charge
of
perjury
is
one
that
is
rarely
applied,
or
rarely
tried
in
the
state
of
arkansas
at
any
rate
that
not
meaning
to
cast
any
doubt
on
the
jury
system
or
the
system
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
but
in
the
matter
of
such
as
this
i
think
certainly
they
would
be,
if
this
court
reversed
i
think
certainly
they
would
be
retried
for
their
crimes,
but
the
state
would
once
again
contend
that
there
really
was
no
reversible
error
here
because
there
was
no
conflict
and
if
counsel
might
speak
further
as
to
the
per
se
rule
advocated
by
the
amicus
and
apparently
by
the
defense
counsel,
state
would
reiterate
that
it
whole
heartedly
opposes
such
because
such
a
per
se
rule
is
premised
on
the
idea
or
on
the
belief
that
there
is
conflict
every
time
multiple
defendants
are
represented
by
a
sole
counsel.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
i
think
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
well,
the
state
would
oppose
that
rule
as
well
your
honor,
because
i
think
in
addition
to
the
other
summary,
it
certainly
places
in
the
hands
solely,
in
other
words
it
divest
from
the
trial
court
the
making
of
a
constitutional
decision
and
it
removes
the
trial
court
or
divests
it
from
the
supervising
protectionary
power
that
it
exercises
as
to
the
defendants
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
mr.
justice
white
i
do
not
think
that
such
confidence
revelations
are
necessary
in
what
a
very,
very
few
minuscule
questions.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
and
yes
sir,
i
think
if
necessary
a
counsel
strongly
believes
that
there
is
a
conflict
and
it
would
necessitate
i
think
disciplinary
rule
1-104
(c)
(2),
believe
it
is
would
allow
for
that
for
the
revelation
of
confidences
when
so
ordered
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
oh!
i
see
nothing
that
is
wrong
with
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
no,
sir
i
do
not.
in
fact
i
think
certainly
i
know
if
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
purvis
it
is
good,
but
by
the
same
token
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
done
anything
wrong.
i
do
not
think
the
constitution
has
been
violated
by
the
most
representation
until
you
can
show
some
actual
conflict
and
i
would
simply
close
by
saying
that
the
state's
position
as
to
what
should
be
the
rule
as
to
the
determination
of
conflict
is
outlined
in
the
conclusionary
part
of
our
brief.
are
there
any
further
questions?
