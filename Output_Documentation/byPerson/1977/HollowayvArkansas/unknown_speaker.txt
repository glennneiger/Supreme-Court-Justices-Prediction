mr.
hall,
do
i
understand
that
the
respective
alibi
defenses
were
not
incompatible,
however?
unknown
speaker
in
arkansas
is
a
codefendant
then
permitted
to
cross-examination
of
another
defendant,
when
he
takes
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
clear
that
if
they
have
separate
counsel
they
may
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall
do
you
want
the
per
se
rule
or
you
are
asking
for
that
one
counsel
may
not
represent
more
than
one
codefendant?
unknown
speaker
what
happens,
how
many
public
defenders
officers
do
you
have
in
little
rock,
just
one?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
if
you
represented
one
of
these
codefendants
that
your
office
could
not
represent
any
of
the
others?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
mean
that
the
court
would
have
to
go
outside
your
office
to
appoint
for
the
codefendants?
unknown
speaker
go
back
to
the
older
system?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall
are
funds
available
in
arkansas
for
the
retention
of
outside
counsel
in
a
situation
like
this?
unknown
speaker
and
that
fund
would
be
available
to
retain
outside
counsels?
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
your
motion
had
been
granted,
where
would
the
lawyers
come
from
and
who
would
pay
them?
unknown
speaker
general
fund.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
answers
my
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
i
am
rather
bothered
the
way
my
brother
white
is.
you
are
presenting
a
constitutional
issue
here
and
that
means
that
we
have
to
evolve
some
standards.
i
take
it
in
your
colloquy
with
the
other
justices
that
you
are
really
asking
for
a
per
se
rule.
am
i
not
correct
this
court
has
never
gone
that
far
before,
we
certainly
did
not
do
it
in
the
glasser
case?
unknown
speaker
but
you
feel
this
is
the
only
way
to
handle
it
here?
unknown
speaker
but
only
if
the
attorney
demands
a
separate
representation,
representing
that
there
is
a
conflict?
unknown
speaker
is
it
enough
on
his
demand.
unknown
speaker
is
it
enough
fund
if
he
already
demands
it,
or
do
you
think
--?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
do
you
think
you
should
come
up
with
something
more
than
an
allegation
of
conflict?
unknown
speaker
but
you
see
on
coming
back
to
standards,
is
it
enough
merely
to
make
the
request
or
must
the
request
be
accompanied
by
at
least
the
proffer
as
the
chief
was
indicating
and
i
would
be
interested
in
where
you
think
the
perimeters
of
this
constitutional
issue
should
be
drawn?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
way
out
would
be
this
in
camera
here
in
before
the
judge
and
i
take
it,
you
do
not
go
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
i
have
understood
you
to
say
that
none
of
these
defendants
confessed,
but
i
thought
campbell
did
confess?
unknown
speaker
but
his
confession
was
introduced
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
in
that
statement
although
he
implicated
the
codefendants,
their
names
were
stricken,
that
is
from
the
confession
as
introduced?
