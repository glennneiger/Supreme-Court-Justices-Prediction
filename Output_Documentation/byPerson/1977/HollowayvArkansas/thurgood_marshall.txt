justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
the
judge
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
did
not
ask
for
it,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
ask
for
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
had
asked
what
you
would
have
told
him,
what
you
told
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
hall
the
record
does
show
that
the
first
time
any
judicial
officer
asked
you,
you
gave
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
right
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
have
been
asked
before
you
have
to
give?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
told
that
there
was
no
conflict
where
the
judge
said
there
was
no
conflict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
in
the
record
is
it
that
the
judge
said
there
is
no
conflict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
would
be
before
the
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
have
happened
if
that
developed
in
the
middle
of
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what
do
you
do
with
double
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
it
will
be
arguably?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
question
that
he
did
deny
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
other
defendants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
cannot
reach
at
a
conclusion
as
properly
as
you
can
because
i
do
not
know
what
information
the
defense
counsel
had
and
i
submit,
i
do
not
think
you
do
either,
you
do
not
know
what
he
wanted
to
cross-examine
all
because
he
was
never
allowed
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
what
he
wanted
to
cross-examine
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
had
been
asked,
he
would
have
made
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
time
any
judge
asked
him
the
reasons
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
he
admitted
he
gave
him
the
answer
until
he
stood
here
and
said
any
other
judge
would
ask
and
he
would
oppose
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
are
blessed
with
the
record
which
says
you
cannot
cross-exam?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
blessed
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
not
interested.
the
judge
says
well,
what
did
he
say
now,
as
i
remember
the
judge
said
you
know
you
cannot
go,
that
is
all
he
said.
the
judge
did
not
give
any
reason
to
it,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
said
you
cannot
cross-examine
your
own
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
that
apply
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
you
cannot
cross-examine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
denied
in
the
right,
did
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general
what
is
so
wrong
with
an
individual
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
way
you
keep
arguing,
you
keep
resisting
it,
it
seems
like
it
is
some
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
good.
