mr.
harold
l.
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
question
presented,
one
point
of
law
presented
to
the
court
for
consideration
today
and
that
is
whether
the
petitioners
were
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
although
the
trial
court
appointing
a
public
defender
to
represent
three
defendants
in
the
same
trial
over
their
objections.
prior
to
the
trial
a
motion
for
a
severance
and
separate
counsel
was
filed
by
the
public
defender
with
the
court
and
it
was
overruled.
before
this
third
trial
on
the
day
of
the
trial,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
made
over
a
motion
which
was
denied.
the
trial
started
and
during
the
direct
examination
of
one
of
the
petitioners,
another
petitioner
who
is
there
at
the
counsel
table
objected
to
a
question
to
which
the
court
overruled
and
said
your
attorney
will
answer
any,
make
any
objection
on
your
behalf.
at
that
time
out,
the
public
defender
was
asking
the
witness
a
question
which
the
witness
also
happens
to
be
a
codefendant
and
he
was
unable
to
make
an
objection
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
holloway
because
he
was
also
his
attorney
and
attorney
for
the
witness.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
sir
prior
to
going
to
the
court
there
was,
but
then
when
the
court
said
you
will
represent
all
three,
you
cannot
cross-examine
your
own
witness
which
happens
to
be
a
defendant.
i
had
to
change
my
plans,
and
i
could
not
cross-examine
my
own
witness
to
bring
out
incriminating
evidence
against
he
or
the
other
two
codefendants.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir
because
he
was
my
client.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
all
three.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
but
i
have
been
admonished
by
the
court
not
to
cross-examine
my
own
witness,
i
could
not
cross
examine,
these
are
exact
words,
well,
you
have
no
right
to
cross
examine
your
own
witness
then
he
told
me
to
proceed
like
you
told
me
to.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
they
had
alibi
defense.
they
testified
over
my
objections,
i
mean,
over
my
advice
and
denied
being
there,
which
i
could
not
state
to
the
court
what
they
have
told
me
in
confidence.
in
discussing
the
case
with
them,
i
talked
to
each
one
individually
as
they
requested
and
so
anything
one
of
them
told
me
was
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
other
two.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
if
they
have
separate
counsel,
yes
sir.
this
is
the
first
instance
that
come
across
where
i
have
been
appointed
to
represent
three
over
my
objections
where
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
in
my
opinion.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
they
can,
yes
sir.
the
court
told
me
to
proceed
as
he
had
told
me
to,
we
went
on,
and
i
was
abiding
by
the
aba
standards
that
a
lawyer
should
decline
to
act
for
more
than
one
defendant
if
there
is
a
possible
conflict,
but
on
this
case
a
public
defender,
we
had
to
go
ahead
and
take
the
three
and
did
not
make
a
motion
to
the
court
and
at
no
time
did
the
court
ever
asked
me
to
eliminate,
i
mean,
to
find
what
the
conflict
of
interest
was.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
sir
if
there
is
no
conflict,
at
the
attorney's
investigation
there
is
no
conflict
i
have
represented
more
than
one
since
that
time.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
i
just
have
one
and
three
others
to
handle
the
caseload
for
the
full
district,
two
counties.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
there
are
only
being
three
public
defenders
in
the
office
or
five
if
they
are
all
mingled
together,
we
have
one
secretary
to
help
with
it
and
that
makes
it
hard
to
keep
one's
file
privilege
from
the
other.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir
i
think
for
sure.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
your
honor
i
filed
a
written
motion
and
two
oral
motions
and
each
one
of
the
defenders
at
the
trial
got
up
and
requested
a
separate
counsel
and
a
severance.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir,
there
was
and
i
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
the
court
did
not
ask
me
and
told
me
to
proceed
on,
like
he
had
told
me
not
to
cross-examine
my
own
witness,
he
did
not
ask
me
what
the
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
sir,
i
think
it
should
be
one
separate
attorney
for
each
defendant
because
if
the
attorney
the
reveals
what
his
clients
told
him
in
confidence
to
court
or
anyone
then
he
loses
his
respect
from
his
client
and
freedom
where
he
would
go
in
and
converse
with
him
further
in
the
matter.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir,
where
there
has
been
no
conflict
of
interest
to
each
one
and
that
is
for
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
and
this
when
he
had
his
mind
made
up
your
honor
with
what
was
going
on
and
i
had
to
go
as
the
court
said
or
be
in
contempt.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
your
honor,
at
the
present
time
we
are
paid
a
fee
on
each
case
which
we
try
or
appointed
on
which
goes
into
a
fund.
when
the
fund
builds
up
they
pay
our
salaries.
that
fee
is
$
350
maximum,
with
a
$100
for
investigation,
if
we
use
investigators.
if
they
wish
to
appoint
three
different
attorneys
they
would
not
go
to
county,
but
it
would
go
to
counsels.
they
pay
us
(inaudible)
fee
we
still
get
one
fee.
they
would
if
they
had
an
additional
counsel
to
be
paid
more,
but
we
are
paid
only
per
case
basis
and
it
goes
into
the
fund,
then
they
pay
your
salaries,
and
all
expenses
that
are
there.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
sir
where
the
order
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
they
would
come
out
of
county
general
fund.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
which
they
have
a
certain
amount
set
aside
per
year.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
i
could
not
show
within
the
prejudice
without
revealing
the
information
that
my
clients
had
told
me
and
i
could
not
tell
the
court
that
or
to
bring
it
out,
that
they
have
told
me
contrary
to
what
they
testified
on
the
stand.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
sir
there
was
three
men
who
come
into
this
cafe.
it
had
closed,
they
went
into
back
door,
one
downstairs,
one
man
stayed
at
the
top
of
the
stairs,
two
of
the
men
went
to
the
room
where
they
were
counting
the
money
received
for
the
day,
and
there
they
robbed
them
and
two
other
men
raped
two
other
girls.
now,
there
was
no
testimony
that
the
third
man
raped
them.
just
two
of
them,
each
one
has
raped
twice
and
they
testified
by
the
same
man,
i
mean
same
two.
now,
there
is
a
question
as
to
who
was
at
the
top
of
stairs,
and
who
was
involved
in
the
rapes
downstairs.
i
had
that
information
and
i
could
not
cross-examine
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
sir
because
it
was
not
in
the
record.
i
could
not
bring
out
from
the
witness
as
they
testified.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
but
i
have
not
mentioned
any
names.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
i
was
just
answering
your
question
sir,
where
you
asked
me,
now
the
judges
did
not
ask
for
oral
argument
in
arkansas
supreme
court.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir
and
they
did
not
ask
me
the
point
and
they
asked
me
i
would
have
explained
like
i
had
here.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
sir?
mr.
harold
l.
hall
the
attorney
and
the
defendants
also.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well,
if
there
was
proof
of
--
i
mean,
you
have
to
put
on
the
confidential
information
of
the
clients,
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
did
not
ask
for
it
and
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
sir
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
well
if
there
is
a
parole
for
proof
it
would
have
to
be
kept
or
the
defendant's
communication,
his
privilege
communication
to
his
attorney
would
be
kept
mute
and
it
is
hard
for
different
trial
judges,
it
is
hard
to
one
of
them
will
discuss
the
matter
and
let
something
slip
where
normally
he
would
not.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir.
not
the
trial
judge
and
if
there
was
a
different
judge.
the
judge
is
not
hearing
the
case.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
i
feel
that
the
court
would
remember
that
and
some
of
its
ruling
there
might
be
presence
to
want
or
--
may
where
he
would
be
wanting
which
one
was
the
one
who
stayed
at
top
of
the
stairs.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
but
we
have
still
not
mentioned
any
names.
i
was
never
asked
whether
the
trial
judge
or
the
--
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
as
he
had
posed
(inaudible)
at
this
morning.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
that
is
right.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
one
firm,
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
thank
you
sir.
mr.
harold
l.
hall
no
your
honor.
