justice
potter
stewart
your
brother's
point
is
that
he
was
charged
with
representing
that
defendant,
that
witness.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
last
thing
it
would
have
been
wholly
inconsistent
with
his
representation
of
that
defendant
for
him
to
set
out
to
cross
examine
him
and
show
that
he
was
a
lier?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
was
just
putting
in
his
claim
as
an
impossible
dilemma?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
representing
that
defendant,
he
just
was
--
it
would
have
been
wholly
inconsistent
with
his
defense
of
that
man
to
cross
examine
him
and
show
that
his
testimony
was
untrue,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
dilemma
that
he
points
out
to
us.
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
point
is
that
not
that
it
was
not
allowed,
but
that
forced
as
he
was
to
represent
all
three
people,
he
could
not
conscientiously
cross-examine
any
single
one
of
them
which
would
have
been
damaging
to
his
own
client?
