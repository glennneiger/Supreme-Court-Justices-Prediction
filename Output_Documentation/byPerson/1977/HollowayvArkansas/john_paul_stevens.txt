justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hall,
you
did,
if
i
understand
the
record
correctly,
you
did
represent
it
to
the
trial
judge,
you
did
not
just
ask
for
a
separate
lawyer.
you
did
represent
to
them
that
you
had
conversed
with
the
three
clients
and
in
your
professional
judgment
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
made
that
representation
as
a
member
of
the
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
rule
that
you
asked
for
is
one
that
would
only
apply
where
the
lawyer
puts
his
professional
reputation
on
the
line
in
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
purvis,
let
me
ask
you
question
about
the
practical
preparation
for
the
trial.
supposing
that
one
of
the
men
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
lawyer
made
the
judgment
that
it
would
be
better
for
that
particular
defendant
to
tell
the
whole
truth;
to
explain
that
he
was
there,
he
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
the
other
two
men
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
did
the
other
things.
could
the
lawyer
in
good
and
consistently
with
his
obligation
to
the
other
two
people,
advise
that
defendant
to
take
that
posture
at
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
have
done
that
--
could
he
have
done
that
while
he
was
representing
all
three?
could
he
have
said,
?i
advise
you,?
who
was
the
man
at
the
top
of
the
stairs,
?i
think
you
ought
to
tell
the
whole
truth??
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
in
order
to
go
to
the
court,
would
he
had
not
had
found
it
necessary
to
explain
to
the
court
that
these
men
were
really
guilty.
would
that
not
have
been
necessary
in
order
to
tell
the
court
about
the
problem?
