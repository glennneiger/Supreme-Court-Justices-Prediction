mr.
william
w.
sturges
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964.
this
particular
action
began
or
had
its
genesis
in
the
charge
that
was
filed
with
the
eeoc
in
1968.
this
charge
was
processed
and
disposed
of
by
a
'right
to
sue'
letter
issued
by
that
agency
in
july
1970.
in
january
1974,
the
commission
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
virginia.
on
that
charge
on
the
basis
of
purported
authority
contained
in
the
1972
amendments
to
the
act.
the
eeoc
commission
lost.
some
time
after
that
the
prevailing
defendant
pursuant
to
section
706
(k)
of
title
vii,
which
states,
"the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney’s
fee,
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
for
attorney’s
fees
in
the
case."
the
district
court
held
that
the
prevailing
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
because
the
eeoc
had
exercised
good
faith
in
bringing
and
maintaining
the
suit.
christiansburg
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit.
at
this
time
the
fourth
circuit
had
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
newman
versus
piggie
park
enterprises
to
the
effect
that
prevailing
plaintiffs
should
be
awarded
attorney’s
fees
in
the
ordinary
cases
unless
there
are
some
special
compelling
circumstances
that
they
should
not
be.
despite
this
rule,
it
was
followed
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
case
of
prevailing
plaintiffs.
the
fourth
circuit
in
a
two
to
one
decision,
ruled
in
favor
of
the
eeoc.
so
we
are
now
before
this
court
with
the
issue
before
the
court
fairly
simple
in
the
sense.
the
issue
being
whether
prevailing
defendants
and
plaintiffs
are
to
be
treated
equally
in
the
awarding
of
attorney’s
fees
under
the
statute.
as
of
this
time,
some
of
the
circuit
courts
follow
a
double
standard
in
which
they
award
attorney’s
fees
to
defendants
only
in
bad
faith
cases
while
other
circuit
courts
most
recently
panels
of
the
sixth
and
the
fifth
circuit
are
ruled
that
defendants
are
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
on
the
same
basis
as
the
plaintiffs.
we
of
course
argue
that
equality
of
treatment
should
prevail.
in
our
brief,
we
have
argued
that
the
plain
meaning
of
section
706
should
control
that
the
statute
says
simply
the
court
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
your
honor
that
is
what
we
argued
in
our
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
our
oral
argument
it
was
directed
to,
the
rule
should
be
the
same
for
the
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
indeed
as
we
point
out
in
this
brief
here,
if
the
rule
is
not
to
be
the
same
for
prevailing
defendants
and
prevailing
plaintiffs,
what
is
it
to
be?
we
suggest
it
is
not
to
be
the
bad
faith
rule
for
the
prevailing
defendant
and
the
ordinary
rule
for
the
prevailing
plaintiff
which
is
the
court
of
appeals’
rule,
if
it
is
not
to
be
that
then
a
new
rule
from
whole
clause,
if
you
will,
has
to
be
construed
whatever
that
may
be.
frankly
in
the
circuit
court
we
suggest
that
some
rule
or
reason,
but
that
was
very
difficult,
if
you
will,
to
apply,
and
secondly
there
was
really
no
statutory
basis
for
that.
if
i
may
add
this
by
the
time
we
arrived
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
tied
was
running
pretty
latch
against
the
position
that
we
now
has
supposed
in
this
court.
in
terms
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
respondent
and
the
amici
who
support
respondent
do
not
seem
to
take
much
issue.
they
suggest
rather
that
the
legislative
history
or
perhaps
policy
considerations
overwrite
what
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
suggests.
in
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
there
is
no
question
that
the
first
bill
that
was
introduced
into
the
house
of
representatives
provided
only
that
prevailing
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled
to
the
award
of
attorney’s
fees.
our
concept
was
subsequently
changed
to
prevailing
party.
two
senators
commented
in
the
debates
and
very
similar
language
under
title
ii
that
if
the
plaintiffs
lost
attorney's
fees
could
be
awarded
against
them,
indeed
one
of
those
senators
replied
to
a
statement
by
senator
irvin
of
north
carolina
that
the
act
might
encourage
ambulant
chasing,
and
the
reply
was
no
it
would
not
encourage
ambulant
chasing
because
the
attorney’s
fees
could
be
awarded
against
the
plaintiff.
now
it
is
arguable
that
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive,
but
what
is
not
inconclusive
is
there
is
no
legislative
history,
suggesting
that
a
different
standard
applied
to
defendants
then
applied
to
plaintiffs.
there
is
just
nothing
then
the
legislative
history
that
deals
without
particular
subject
matter.
in
view
of
that
which
concluded
that
the
legislative
history
is
inconclusive,
then
we
suggest
all
them
more
reason.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
should
apply
and
the
rule
let
so
provides.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
a
different
standard
should
apply
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
only
that
the
statute
suggest
that
both
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
are
first
of
all
entitled
to
the
attorney’s
fee.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
and
everybody
agrees
with
that.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
right.
now,
in
passing
the
statute
if
the
congress
had
intended
that
different
statutes
or
different
standards
would
apply,
it
could,
for
example,
have
just
said,
only
prevailing
plaintiffs
will
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees,
and
then
in
that
event,
the
only
time
the
defendants
would
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
if
they
prevail
would
be
if
the
plaintiff
had
acted
in
bad
faith.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
well,
we
--
mr.
william
w.
sturges
well,
this
court
has
indicated
in
both
the
alyeska
cases
and
in
the
newman
versus
piggie
park
that
the
courts
have
the
inherent
jurisdiction
to
award
attorney’s
fees
to
either
a
plaintiff
for
defendant
if
the
others
has
acted
in
bad
faith.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
well,
perhaps
my
choice
that
the
word
only
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
was
unfortunate.
i
perhaps
should
have
said
prevailing
plaintiffs.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
well,
your
honor,
the
congress
certainly
did
not
define
discretion,
but
this
court
did.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
well,
i
read
the
decuisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
william
w.
sturges
chanslash
foot
(ph).
this
court
in
the
newman
case
said,
"here
is
how
the
discretion
is
to
be
applied.
here
is
how
the
district
courts
are
to
apply
the
discretion."
and
this
happened
to
be
a
plaintiff’s
case
and
then
it
said,
it
should
be
applied
in
the
ordinary
case.
attorney’s
fees
should
be
granted.
now
all
we
are
saying
to
this
court
is
that
standard
should
be
the
same
for
the
defendant
if
some
other
standard
should
not
prevail
or
if
this
court
thinks
some
other
standard
should
be
imposed
under
the
act.
fine
just
it
should
be
the
same
for
the
plaintiff
as
for
the
defendant
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
that
suggest
otherwise.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
your
honor,
i
think
all
i
need
to
go
is
that
whatever
discretion
is
exercised
and
for
either
party,
it
should
be
the
same.
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
the
briefs
for
the
amici,
the
respondent's
amici,
suggest
that
if
this
court
were
to
rule
as
the
petitioner
argues
that
plaintiffs
would
be
chilled
in
bringing
actions
under
the
act.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that,
that
has
not
happened
up
to
this
point
and
this
statute
has
plaintiffs
--
attorneys
have
been
aware
of
the
statute
since
1964,
and
indeed
there
has
been
a
plethora
of
litigation
under
title
vii.
so
we
do
not
conceive
if
this
court
rules
that
the
statute
means
the
same
kind
of
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
for
both
parties
that
this
will
chill
any
litigation
that
it
has
not
chilled
so
far.
at
most
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
the
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
was
both
to
encourage
litigation
and
discourage
litigation.
to
encourage
litigation
that
would
be
meritorious
and
to
discourage
litigation
that
would
be
unmeritorious.
the
statute
suggests
that
the
determinant
is
who
prevails,
whether
it
is
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant,
and
that
prevailer
is
the
one
that
is
entitled
to
the
attorney’s
fees.
i
guess,
i
can
best
sum
up,
if
you
will,
stating
what
the
dissent
said
in
the
court
of
appeals.
then
that
result
we
end
up
with
as
a
result
of
the
majority
opinion
under
statute
which
says
the
court
may
allow
an
attorney’s
fees
in
its
discretion
to
the
prevailing
party,
it
is
that
a
prevailing
plaintiff
is
unallowed
and
attorney’s
fees
absent
exceptional
circumstances,
while
a
prevailing
defendant
under
the
same
statute
is
not
allowed
an
attorney’s
fee
unless
the
plaintiff
has
prosecuted
his
action
in
bad
faith.
i
suggest
this
is
not
the
level
floor
the
court
house
demands.
we
would
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do,
a
few
remarks.
first
of
all,
in
respect
to
considering
the
financial
ability
of
the
loser
to
pay,
we
think
that
is
a
matter
that
a
district
court
can
properly
consider,
and
if
the
plaintiff
is
judgment
proof
or
if
the
defendant
is
judgment
proof,
certainly
in
that
kind
of
a
case
the
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
not
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
the
winning
party.
in
respect
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
respect
to
a
nonprofit
corporation,
that
is
a
matter
again
we
would
submit
in
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
and
discretion
and
undoubtedly
a
variety
of
facts
would
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
as
to
whether
an
award
should
be
made.
secondly,
the
law
as
it
existed,
before
title
vii
or
the
1964
act
was
passed,
provided
attorney's
fees
to
a
party
if
that
party
was
subjected
to
a
vexatious
or
bad
faith
suit
or
defense.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
that
was
in
the
absence
of
any
legislation.
yes,
your
honor
that
was
the
inherent
equitable
power
of
the
federal
court.
now,
there
are
some
40
or
50
statutes
that
the
congress
has
passed
in
respect
to
attorney's
fees
and
they
provide
attorney's
fees
in
a
variety
of
cases
-
sometimes
to
the
prevailing
party,
sometimes
to
the
injured
party,
sometimes
to
the
prevailing
plaintiff,
sometimes
in
exceptional
cases,
sometimes
otherwise.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
holding
by
this
court
or
by
any
court
that
when
congress
passes
a
statute
allowing
attorney's
fees
to
the
prevailing
party,
that
if
the
either
party
had
acted
in
bad
faith
they
would
have
been
precluded
from
receiving
attorney's
fees
absent
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
would
allow.
indeed
this
court
in
newman
v.
piggie
park
enterprises
in
its
footnote
4
stated,
"if
congress'
objective
had
been
to
authorize
the
assessment
of
attorney's
fees
against
defendants
who
made
completely
groundless
contention
for
purposes
of
delay,
no
new
statutory
provision
would
have
been
necessary."
for
it
has
long
been
held
that
a
federal
court
may
award
counsel
fees
to
a
successful
plaintiff
where
a
defense
has
been
maintained
"in
bad
faith,
vexatiously,
wantonly,
or
for
oppressive
reasons.
and
the
court
again
adopted
this
same
language
in
its
alyeska
pipeline
service
company
case,
in
which
it
said
the
court,
in
referring
to
the
same
footnote
in
newman
where
it
stated,
the
court
reasoned
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
authorize
fees
only
on
the
basis
of
bad
faith,
no
new
legislation
would
have
been
required
in
view
of
the
history
of
the
bad
faith
exception.
so
we
say
to
the
court
and
argued
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
congress
to
pass
all
the
statute
allowing,
including
prevailing
parties
in
the
statute
in
order
to
award
attorney's
fees
for
bad
faith
either
to
the
plaintiff,
or
the
defendant.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
w.
sturges
are
you
saying
that
the
rule
annunciated
in
piggie
park
should
apply
to
defendants
as
well
as
the
plaintiffs?
mr.
william
w.
sturges
that
is
our
position
mr.
justice.
now,
in
respect
to
public
policy
in
the
newman
case
this
court
analogized
the
successful
plaintiff,
as
carrying
the
burden
of
a
private
attorney
general
--
and
that
was
based
in
part
on
the
statutory
history,
what
little
areas
to
in
encourage
such
litigation.
as
we
have
pointed
out
that
statutory
history
also
discourages
unmeritorious
litigation
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court,
the
analogy
that
the
successful
plaintiff,
if
you
will,
is
similar
to
the
private
defendant.
lastly
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
attorney's
fees
act
is,
in
no
way,
irrelevant
to
what
the
congress
in
1964
intended
in
respect
to
the
provision
under
consideration
here
and
we
submit
i
believe
it
is
footnote
36
in
the
teamster
v.
time
(ph)
case
as
a
further
support
for
that
position.
thank
you.
