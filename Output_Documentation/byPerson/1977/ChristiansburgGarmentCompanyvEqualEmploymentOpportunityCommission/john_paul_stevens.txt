mr.
sturges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
do
in
this
court
take
the
possession
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
both
parties.
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
suggests
that
you
took
a
different
position
in
that
court.
that
there
you
argued
there
was
a
difference
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant,
and
that
the
standard
would
be
reasonable
as
opposed
to
good
faith
with
the
defendant.
is
that
correct
or
did
you
take
it
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
you
changed
from
your
brief
to
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
martin
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
case
which
allowed
fees
which
was
cited
in
the
cert
petition
was
correctly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
what
the
ninth
circuit
felt,
i
am
wondering,
what
the
government’s
position
is?
was
that
a
proper
case
for
the
amendments
of
fee
when
that
fits
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
martin
when
you
answered
mr.
justice
powell's
questions
about
the
character
of
a
corporate
defendant,
a
charity,
or
a
small
business,
were
you
answering
with
the
reference
to
fee
awards
against
the
plaintiff
or
fee
awards
against
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
plaintiff's
claim
for
fees,
in
a
successful
plaintiff's
claim
for
fees,
the
court
might
deny
them
on
the
ground
that
the
defendant
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
not
clear
whether
you
asked
me
in
the
context
the
defendant
or
plaintiff
prevailing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
saying
that
and
when
the
defendant
prevails,
a
factor
that
would
tend
to
justify
a
fee
would
be
that
the
defendant
was
a
charitable
corporation
or
small
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
depart
from
any
answer
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sturges
can
i
interrupt,
for
just
a
moment?
i
was
reflecting
on
your
argument
last
time
and
you
said
that
your
position
now
is
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
both
sides
whether
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
prevails,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
does
that
mean
that
which
of
two
positions
do
you
therefore
take
that
the
rule
of
piggie
park
has
been
changed
for
successful
plaintiffs
or
that
whenever
a
defendant
wins,
the
defendant
should
routinely
give
fees
from
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
the
normal
case
if
the
defendant
wins,
he
automatically
gets
fees
unless
there
is
some
exceptional
reason
for
denying
a
fee.
