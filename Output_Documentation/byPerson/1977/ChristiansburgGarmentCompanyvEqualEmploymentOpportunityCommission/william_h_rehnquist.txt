justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
support
discretionary
treatment
that
they
cannot
be
manifestly
different,
so
as
to
produce
different
results
simply
because
one
is
the
plaintiff
and
one
is
the
defendant,
but
leaving
otherwise
a
wide
discretion
in
the
trial
judge,
is
in
fact
as
far
as
you
need
to
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
one
of
the
eeoc’s
motives
in
brining
an
action
against
a
defendant
one
of
several
motives
was
the
feeling
that
they
had
a
lot
more
legal
resourced
that
they
recommend
then
the
defendant
did,
and
therefore
he
would
be
likely
to
cave
them
and
rather
than
fight
the
thing.
would
that
meet
the
bad
faith
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
do
you
call
it
a
good
faith
test?
good
faith
speaks
to
me
in
terms
of
subjective
intention.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
just
restored
some
another
substantial
meaning
to
the
content
of
the
good
faith.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
discouragement
factor,
do
you
think
awarding
of
attorney’s
fees
the
defendant
has
with
plaintiffs.
so
far
as
the
eeoc
is
concerned,
they
get
their
money
from
the
public
treasury,
and
so
far
as
the
private
plaintiffs
are
concerned,
most
of
them
are
judgment
proof
anywhere
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
can
make
it
against
unsuccessful
plaintiffs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
congress
exclusively
stated
that.
did
you
mean
that
literally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
last
answer
is
correct,
they
simply
would
have
given
attorney's
fees
to
prevailing
plaintiffs
period,
wouldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
could
have
awarded
it
so
their
costs
would
be
allowed
against
the
united
states,
but
not
attorney's
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
what
i
suggest
that
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
not
wholly
satisfactory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
congress
was
seeking
to
encourage
private
litigants
to
prosecute
but
not
to
encourage
to
the
same
extent
meritorious
defense
is
to
be
made.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
read
the
statute
if
they
are
without
referring
to
these
various
remarks
on
the
floor?
