was
it
decided
a

petition
it
sounds
like,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
not
think
the
standard
should
be
awarding
fees
to
a
defendant
that
if
a
judge
thinks
the
eeoc
or
the
plaintiff
should
have
known
he
is
going
to
lose
the
case.
justice
byron

talking
about
subjective
and
subjecting
bad
faith.
