justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sturges,
you
keep
talking
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
statute
says
that
the
trial
court
may
exercise
its
discretion
to
assess
attorney’s
fees
either
against
the
plaintiff
or
against
the
defendant.
it
does
not
say
that
that
it
shall
--
it
did
not
say
a
word
about
it
is
applying
the
same
criteria,
may
be
on
its
discretionary
the
--
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
that
it
need
not
and
should
not
use
the
same
criteria.
it
talks
about
the
trial
court’s
discretion.
but
there
was
--
what
is
there
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
in
other
words
that
leads
an
elective
way
to
conclusion
that
the
criteria
have
to
be
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
nothing
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
is
there
that
requires
identity
of
criteria?
justice
potter
stewart
and
everybody
agrees
with
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
what
the
statute
said
that
sometimes
attorney’s
fees
can
be
assessed
against
plaintiffs
and
everybody
agrees
that
sometimes
they
can.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wonder
if
they
would
ever
be
if
the
congress
had
said
only
prevailing
plaintiffs
shall
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
we
think
it
would
be
pretty
clear
that
prevailing
defendants
would
then
under
such
enactment
never
be
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
no
congressional
enactment
to
the
contrary.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
chanslash
foot
(ph).
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
of
those
remaining
out
of
the
100,000
are
free
to
sue
once
they
get
a
right
to
sue
letter.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
100,000
potential
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
are
entitled
--
and
all
of
them
are
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
presently
under
the
newman
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
all
been
given
right
to
sue
letters
by
the
commissioner.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
hypothesis.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
martin,
your
answer
somewhat
confuses
me.
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
a
district
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
to
impose
attorney's
fees
upon
plaintiffs
only
upon
a
finding
that
the
action
had
been
brought
in
bad
faith
or
vexatiously.
and
i
should
think
the
identity
of
the
defendant
would
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
that
criteria.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
should
it
be
any
element
in
the
district
court's
decision
in
whether
or
not
to
exercise
its
discretion
that
says
attorney's
fees
--
certainly
whether
or
not
a
claim
was
brought
in
bad
faith
or
vexatiously
has
really
nothing
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
how
rich
or
how
small,
you
have
to
be
familiar.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
answre
is
tied
that
if
not
it
either
it
should
be
or
in
any
event
it
could
permissibly
be
included
which
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
are
saying
your
brief
as
i
read
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
am
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
say
should
be
the
sole
test;
that
is
the
submission
in
your
brief
as
i
understand
it
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
do
now
concede
that
in
addition
to,
whether
or
not
the
action
was
brought
in
bad
faith,
or
vexatiously,
the
court
might
permissibly
consider
other
elements
in
deciding
whether
or
not
it
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
things
are
inequipoise
except
for
that
element
then
it
is
going
to
be
dispositive.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
a
somewhat
different
position
than
the
position
taken
in
your
brief.
i
understand
it,
am
i
wrong
in
my
understanding
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
are
not
a
police
court
here
to
decide
each
case
on
sort
of
non
hope
basis.
one
of
our
functions,
perhaps
primary
the
functions
as
to
give
some
guidance
to
the
courts
and
lawyers
of
this
country
and
in
this
area
it
is
quite
important
that
seems
to
me
that
what
we
are
asked
to
do
is
to
set
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
area
within
which
the
district
courts
should
exercise
its
discretion.
justice
potter
stewart
then
if
it
should
never
be
dispositive
then
it
is
an
impermissible
element,
and
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
the
absence
of
any
legislation
qualify.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
section
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
provides
that
in
any
action
or
proceeding
under
this
title.
the
court
in
its
discretion,
may
allow
the
prevailing
party,
a
reasonable
attorney
fee.
the
question
in
this
case
is
under
what
circumstances
an
attorney's
fee
should
be
allowed
when
the
defendant
is
the
prevailing
party
in
a
title
vii
action.
a
question
about
which
the
federal
courts
have
expressed
divergent
views.
the
respondent
commission
sued
the
petitioner
company
alleging
that
it
had
engaged
in
discriminatory
employment
practices
in
violation
of
title
vii.
the
district
court
ultimately
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
company.
the
company
then
petitioned
for
the
allowance
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
commission.
the
district
court
concluded
that
"an
award
of
attorney's
fees
was
not
justified
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
in
a
divided
vote.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
an
important
question
of
federal
law.
the
company
contends
that
the
criterion
for
a
successful
plaintiff
should
apply
equally
as
a
guide
to
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
a
successful
defendant.
its
submission,
in
short,
is
that
every
prevailing
defendant
in
a
title
vii
action
should
receive
an
allowance'
of
attorney's
fees
"unless
special
circumstances
would
render
such
an
award
unjust."
the
respondent
commission,
by
contrast,
argues
that
the
prevailing
defendant
should
receive
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
only
when
it
is
found
that
the
plaintiff's
action
was
brought
in
bad
faith.
we
have
concluded
that
neither
of
these
positions
is
correct.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today.
we
have
concluded
that
a
district
court
may
in
its
discretion
award
attorney's
fees
to
a
prevailing
defendant
in
a
title
vii
case
upon
a
finding
that
the
plaintiff's
action
was
frivolous,
unreasonable,
or
without
foundation,
even
though
not
brought
in
subjective
bad
faith.
in
denying
attorney's
fees
to
the
company
in
this
case,
the
district
court
focused
on
precisely
these
standards.
the
court
found
that
"the
commission's
action
in
bringing
suit
cannot
be
characterized
as
unreasonable
or
meritless"
because
"the
basis
upon
which
petitioner
prevailed
was
an
issue
of
first
impression
requiring
judicial
resolution"
and
because
the
"commission's
statutory
interpretation
was
not
frivolous."
the
court
thus
exercised
its
discretion
squarely
within
the
permissible
bounds
of
the
law.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
upholding
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
