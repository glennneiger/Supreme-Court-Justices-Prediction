perhaps,
congress
has
used
the
word
discretion
is
unfortunate
for
you
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
we
do
not
know
what
discretion
means,
do
not
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
my
brothers,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
now
is
whether
we
were
to
understand
the
answers
you
gave
me
still
stand.
[laughter].
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
that
disparage
the
adversary
systems
somewhat
in
that
response
to
mr.
martin,
isn't
that
the
function
of
the
advocates
on
both
sides
to
present
their
positions
vigorously
to
see
that
ultimately
the
intent
of
congress
is
carried
out?
