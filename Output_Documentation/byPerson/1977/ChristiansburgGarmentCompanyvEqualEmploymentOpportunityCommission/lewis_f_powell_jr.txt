justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
martin,
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said
and
what
you
also
have
said
in
your
brief
that
you
would
apply
different
standards
depending
on
whether
you
have
with
the
defendant
prevailing
or
the
plaintiff
prevailing.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
find
any
justification
in
the
language
of
the
statute
for
different
standards?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
my
question
was
in
the
language
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
am
familiar
with
the
language.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
none
whatever.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
so
you
fall
back
solely
on
policy.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
legislative
history
that
would
confine
recovery
of
defendant
to
a
situation
involving
bad
faith?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
(inaudible)
indicate,
why
congress
did
not
make
that
explicit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
bad
faith
standard
is
quite
a
straightjacket.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
eeoc
claims
are
now
pending
at
the
commission
level?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
are
talking
about
pending
claims,
i
think
i
have
read
in
a
press
few
months
ago
that
over
120,000
claims
are
pending.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
martin.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
a
district
court,
in
exercise
of
its
discretion,
consider
the
fact
that
the
prevailing
defendant
was
said
charitable
corporation,
nonprofit
corporation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
view,
could
the
district
court
also
consider
the
size
and
financial
condition
of
many
of
these
defendants
are
quite
small
almost
nonemployed
businesses?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
the
defendant
had
prevailed,
that
was
in
my
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
martin,
you
have
been
subjected
to
very
skillful
cross
examinations
by
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
your
view
that
the
court
acts
in
its
function
as
a
court
of
equity
when
it
makes
its
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
right.
and
are
you
now
saying
that
a
court
of
equity
cannot
consider
the
size
or
characters
of
the
defendant
who
has
prevailed
in
a
title
vii
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
so
what
in
the
statute
gives
you
any
basis
for
making
that
argument?
