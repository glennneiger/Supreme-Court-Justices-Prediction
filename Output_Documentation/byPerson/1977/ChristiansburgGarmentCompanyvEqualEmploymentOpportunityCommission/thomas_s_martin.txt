mr.
thomas
s.
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney’s
fees
provisions
of
title
ii
and
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
are
by
their
terms
permissive
grants
that
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney’s
fee.
in
newman
versus
piggie
park
enterprises,
this
court
established
standards
to
inform
that
discretion
with
respect
to
plaintiffs'
awards
under
title
ii,
and
before
the
court
today
are
similar
standards
for
defendants
also
based
upon
the
proposition
that
statutory
discretion
is
not
a
license
for
arbitrary
action,
and
the
question
here
as
it
was
a
newman,
is
whether
the
standards
properly
effectuate
the
congressional
purpose.
now,
these
standards
which
are
now
followed
by
six
courts
of
appeals,
state
that
the
indicia
associated
with
fee
awards
to
defendants
are
vexatiousness,
meritless
litigation,
abusive
conduct,
frivolous
litigation,
or
an
attempt
to
harass
or
embarrass.
we
think
that
the
so
called
good
faith
test
is
what
congress
intended
because
–
1.
it
tracks
the
purpose
statements
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1964
act.
2.
it
was
relied
upon
by
congress
in
enacting
parallel
civil
rights
legislation.
3.
it
preserved
the
enforcement
incentive
provided
by
section
706
(k).
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
practical
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
courts
in
applying
the
bad
faith
test
look
to
objective
criteria.
no
one
deposes
the
eeoc
to
decide
what
their
motives
were.
they
look
to
whether
they
had
made
sense
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
ground,
whether
there
was
in
fact
some
evidence
of
discrimination.
they
look
to
the
fact
that
the
eeoc
has
a
burden,
a
responsibility
to
advance
title
vii’s
purposes.
this
test
is
applied
in
objective
fashion
rather
than
a
subjective
fashion.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
in
some
ways
it
is
a
misnomer.
it
is
a
short
form
for
the
set
of
indices
that
the
courts
look
to.
these
are
just
references.
the
courts
have
a
discretionary
grant
from
congress,
and
i
look
to
these
indices
to
see
if
something
like
this
has
occurred.
now,
if
the
eeoc
brought
litigation
that
was,
let's
say
had
a
reasonable
legal
ground,
or
let's
say
private
plaintiff,
but
litigation
had
a
reasonable
legal
ground.
this
is
a
carrion
case
in
the
second
circuit,
but
had
brought
that
same
litigation
already
in
another
form
and
lost.
the
court
said,
well,
although
this
is
reasonable,
there
is
a
bad
intent
here,
so
there
can
not
be
bad
intent
cases,
but
most
of
the
time
they
are
looking
for
really
objective
purpose.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
that
there
can
be
that
and
if
that
occurred
that
the
courts
could
award
attorney's
fees
under
this
good
faith
standard.
i
am
just
suggesting
to
you
that
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
there
is
bad
faith
element
in
it.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
not
just
that.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
just
a
subjective
test.
it
does
not
require
for
an
award
of
attorney’s
fees
that
we
proved
that
the
eeoc
had
a
bad
motive.
the
eeoc
brought
an
outrageous
frivolous
litigation.
fees
will
be
awarded
against
the
regardless
of
its
good
motive,
but
it
if
brought
litigation
with
a
bad
motive,
fees
will
also
be
awarded
against
it.
so
it
had
both
aspects.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
find
the
justification,
mr.
justice
powell,
in
the
legislative
history
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
now.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
in
the
language,
all
the
language
says
is
that
the
award
should
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
it
points
out
no
distinction
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
none
whatever.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
not
on
policy
mr.
justice
powell.
we
fall
back
on
a
teaching
of
automobile
and
i
think
what
is
implicit
in
newman
is
that
when
you
have
a
discretionary
standard,
it
is
not
license
for
arbitrary
action.
discretion
has
to
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
purposes
of
title
vii
with
the
statutory
scheme,
with
whatever
there
was
in
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
there
is
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
it
if
i
could,
the
legislative
history
as
you
know
is
a
slain
legislative
history,
but
we
think
the
statementq
with
respect
of
awards,
the
defendants
have
a
uniform
theme
and
those
are
the
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no
it
does
not
indicate
why
it
did
not
make
it
explicit.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
congress
was
enacting
a
new
statute,
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
of
all
the
possible
situations
that
might
arise,
so
what
did
it
grant
a
discretionary
power
and
through
the
legislative
history
gave
a
guidance
to
the
court
in
how
that
discretionary
power
might
be
interpreted,
and
i
think
that
was
not
a
successful
effort
i
think
to
deal
with
kinds
of
problems
which
might
come
up
rather
than
straightjacket
in
the
courts
into
some
particular
standard.
they
gave
them
a
broad
grant
of
discretion
and
through
legislative
history
informed
that
discretion.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
think
it
is
mr.
justice
powell,
unless
you
interpreted
as
a
totally
subjective
standard
which
is
not
and
has
never
been.
if
it
includes
award
of
fees
in
cases
of
frivolousness,
harassing
litigation,
vexatious
litigation,
the
courts
of
appeals
in
carrion
include
unreasonable
litigation
and
new
eighth
circuit
case
includes
unreasonable
litigation.
i
think
that
is
a
broad
standard
and
permits
the
district
court
the
discretion
to
respond
to
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
and
what
congress
was
concerned
about
is
demonstrated
by
the
statements
by
senators
humphrey,
and
senators
lausche,
and
senators
pastore.
and
they
said
that
the
purpose
of
these
fee
awards
to
defendants
was
to
prevent
harassment
suits,
to
prevent
unjustified
suits,
to
prevent
suits
without
foundation,
and
to
prevent
frivolous
suits.
that
is
exactly
we
thank
what
the
good
faith
standard
does.
it
almost
tracks
to
the
language
used
by
congress.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
are
we
talking
about
litigation
or
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
would
be
correct
justice
powell.
let
me
give
you
some
perspective
on
that.
each
year
the
commission
gets
something
in
the
nature
of
100,000
claims,
out
of
all
those
claims
the
commission
selects
out
only
about
300
cases
in
which
to
sue.
so
the
perspective
that
one
might
get
from
the
briefs
of
some
of
the
parties
that
the
commission
is
running
wild
all
over
the
country
suing
people,
i
think
it
is
inaccurate,
and
selecting
300
out
of
100,000
cases
commission
sued
by
statute
only
after
investigation,
only
after
conciliation,
only
after
approval
by
procedure,
only
after
approval
by
the
general
counsel’s
office
and
the
commissioner
itself.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
in
actuality
that
turns
into
as
the
statistics,
i
believe
it
is
in
the
lawyers’
committee
brief
state
that
there
are
about
5,000
suits
last
year
on
employment
discrimination
nature.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
if
they
prevail
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
absolutely,
and
if
those
suits
turn
out
to
be
unreasonable,
frivolous,
meritless,
outrageous,
abusive
all
then
will
be,
all
the
defendants
are
also
entitled
to
test.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
obviously.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
correct.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
case.
i
think
it
is
on
the
line
and
probably
suggest
the
breadth
of
discretion
that
permitted
the
courts
under
the
standard
there
the
eeoc
pursued
an
appeal
from
a
denial
of
an
intervention
order,
it
was
not
totally
denied,
it
was
partially
denied,
and
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
felt
that
the
precedent
was
so
clear
against
the
eeoc’s
action.
that
it
was
in
nature
of
a
frivolous
or
harassment
suit
and
awarded
fees
against
the
eeoc.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
we
thought
it
was
not
a
frivolous
action?
we
thought
it
was
not
abusive
and
fees
ought
not
to
have
been
awarded,
but
we
did
not
seek
certiorari.
but
then
hommerson
(ph)
in
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
something.
i
think
that
is
a
standard
which
would
be
so
difficult
to
apply,
and
a
standard
might
so
discourage
private
enforcement
or
eeoc
enforcement
is
not
be
a
good
standard.
i
think
the
trust
of
what
congress
was
suggesting
that
fee
should
be
awarded
in
something
like
abusive
conduct,
not
just
the
fact
that
the
district
court
says
well,
this
is
obviously
wrong,
but
that
really
looks
like
inabusive.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
the
court
looks
to
one
kind
of
case
for
example
this
case
where
was
a
case
of
first
impression.
in
the
court
that
is
a
court
of
first
impression,
you
know
this
does
not
look
like
abusive
conduct
to
us.
now
if
this
case,
if
the
eeoc
had
brought
a
kind
of
action
and
had
lost
in
ninth
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court
and
tried
again,
the
court
would
say,
well,
regardless
of
the
great
motives
of
the
eeoc
fees
could
be
awarded.
it
is
not
totally
a
subjective
test.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
will
answer
the
question
tomorrow.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
closed
yesterday
justice
rehnquist
had
questioned
whether
fee
awards
against
sometimes
indigent,
title
vii
plaintiffs
would
really
deter
enforcement,
and
some
title
vii
plaintiffs
are
undoubtedly
indigent
and
perhaps
judgment
proof,
many
more
are
not.
title
vii
claims
are
brought
not
only
by
incumbents
and
unsuccessful
applicants
and
not
only
by
blue
collar
workers,
but
by
executives.
we
think
that
the
thread
of
fee
awards
against
their
personal
property,
however,
modest
would
be
a
substantial
deterrent,
and
more
importantly
congress
throught
that
it
had
this
deterrent
effect
because
congress
authorized
fee
awards
was
to
deter
frivolous,
or
abusive
conduct.
this
is
also
the
same
basis
that
this
court
has
used
to
uphold
the
american
rule.
this
court
set
in
fleishman
that
if
plaintiffs
were
forced
to
paying
not
only
their
own
fees,
but
the
fees
of
their
opponents
when
the
lost,
the
poor
might
be
unjustly
discouraged
from
bringing
actions
to
vindicate
their
rights.
we
think
this
is
not
in
abstract
concern,
the
lawyers'
committee
for
civil
rights,
the
naacp
based
upon
their
experience
and
their
briefs,
they
conclude
that
in
ordinary
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
unsuccessful
defendants
would
have
the
substantial
adverse
effect
upon
title
vii
enforcement.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
against
unsuccessful
plaintiffs.
this
is
surely
inconsistent
with
newman
and
we
do
not
think
it
is
impossible
--
we
think
it
is
impossible
but
congress
could
have
intended
that.
especially
since
congress
was
concerned
that
these
plaintiffs
would
be
unable
to
pay
their
own
fees
and
that
is
why
they
passed
the
statute,
senator
humphrey
said,
"the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
help
poor
plaintiffs
bring
meritorious
litigation."
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
the
district
court
could
consider
that.
the
district
court
has
a
grant
of
discretion,
it
is
a
wide
grant,
and
the
courts
have
considered
those
kinds
of
factors
in
the
cases
where
the
good
faith
standard
has
been
implied.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
straightjacket
for
a
district
court
consideration.
they
would
also
have
to
consider
it
though
mr.
justice
powell.
the
status
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
facts
of
the
plaintiff
for
example
might
be
the
eeoc
which
has
an
obligation
to
advance
title
vii
law
might
be
a
poor
plaintiff,
and
it
has
to
consider
the
fact
that
awarding
an
attorney's
fee
might
deter
future
title
vii
litigation.
so
it
has
discretion
and
it
can
consider
that
factor,
but
it
has
to
consider
within
the
whole
scope
of
the
purpose
of
title
vii
to
eliminate
discriminations,
country
and
employment.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
that
district
court
could
consider
that
mr.
justice
powell,
but
it
should
also
consider
these
factors
that
before
congress
was
an
amendment
to
eliminate
fee
awards
against
small
businesses
that
was
in
1972
and
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
congress
rejected
that
amendment
before
congress
would
many
amendments
to
eliminate
the
coverage
of
title
vii
from
small
businesses,
and
nevertheless,
congress
refused
to
withdraw
title
vii
coverage
from
small
businesses.
if
we
had
a
course
of
dealing,
in
which
district
courts
consistently
refused
to
award
fees
in
cases
brought
against
small
businesses,
it
might
effectively
insulate
those
small
businesses
from
title
vii
coverage
and
therefore
reverse
the
two
decisions
made
by
the
congress
-
one
to
cover
them;
and
two,
not
to
allow
mandatory
fees
in
such
cases.
and
let
me
also
mention
that
in
this
case,
christiansburg
was
a
company
in
1970
which
had
230
employees,
and
that
was
almost
ten
times
that
minimal
amount
that
was
needed
for
a
title
vii
coverage,
so
it
would
not
be
dispositive
in
this
case
regardless.
in
answer
to
your
questions
i
think
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
consider
these
factors,
but
it
has
to
measure
all
this
against
title
vii's
purposes.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
the
indicia
associated
with
the
fee
award
or
bad
faith,
vexatiousness
etc.
so
i
think
in
normal
case,
as
a
normal
rule,
fee
should
not
be
awarded
in
absent
those
indicia.
what
the
congress
meant
to
preclude
the
court
from
even
considering
the
fact
that
in
exercise
of
its
discretionary
grant
that
the
employer
was
a
small
employer.
it
does
not
appear
from
the
legislative
history
except
to
the
extent
that
congress
decided
to
cover
those
employers
and
rejected
amendments
that
would
have
given
the
mandatory
awards.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
it
should
not
be
dispositive.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
right
and
that
is
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
saying,
and
that
should
be
then
i
think
that
should
be
the
normal
rule.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
rule
seems
to
be
in
the
nature
of
a
guideline
at
least
as
articulated
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
articulated
whether
in
fact
the
consideration
in
which
mr.
justice
powell
suggests,
should
be
excluded.
they
have
not
said
it
should
be
excluded
and
therefore
i
do
not
think
to
affirm
this
case
which
just
says
that
the
indicia
associated
with
the
award
of
bad
faith
and
vexatiousness,
we
need
it
necessarily
to
deal
with
that
problem
whether
that
is
a
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
i
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals'
decision
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
suggests
that
united
states'
deal,
i
suggest
the
possibility
of
taking
to
consideration
economic
factors
for
example,
and
that
is
how
the
standard
has
been
applied.
as
i
say
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
normal
case
you
are
absolutely
right,
fees
should
be
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
i
mean
i
think
in
the
normal
case,
fee
should
be
denied
in
the
absence
of
these
indicia
of
bad
faith
or
frivolousness.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
should
be
the
sole
test,
but
again
the
grant
of
the
statute
is
discretionary
fee
awards.
okay,
and
the
indicia
are
guidelines
associated
with
that,
are
these
tests
that
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
is
hard
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
that
language
of
statute
and
say
they
can
exclude
it.
i
think
it
should
never
be
dispositive.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
would
be
--
there
could
be
a
case
mr.
justice
stewart
and
what
i
am
saying
is
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
i
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
court
could
take
that
into
consideration,
and
i
think
that
the
normal,
the
indicia
associated
with
the
award
of
attorney's
fee
should
be
vexatiousness
and
frivolousness
normally.
that
is
the
best
answer
that
i
think
i
can
give
to
the
question.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
the
brief's
position
is
that
the
good
faith
standard
should
be
applied
as
it
is
applied
by
courts
of
appeals
now,
and
if
you
look
to
those
decisions,
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
they
do
not
say,
they
have
not
reached
the
question
of
excluding
this
kind
of
concern
altogether.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
what
they
have
reached
is
that
the
normal
indicia
associated
with
the
fee
award
should
be
those
criteria,
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
resolve
this
case
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
that
in
this
kind
of
case
and
the
normal
case
the
vexatious,
frivolous
rules
should
be
dispositive.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
my
answer
is
--
let
me
say
that
my
answer
in
the
(inaudible)
i
do
not
think
it
should
ever
be
dispositive,
and
i
think
that
criteria
should
be
the
vexatious
rule.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
it
does
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
a
rule
that
would
depend
upon
an
ordinary
fee
award
to
plaintiffs
or
that
would
depend
upon
the
reasonableness
alone,
and
looked
to
the
united
states
steel
rule
which
was
dependence
upon
the
indicia
of
frivolousness,
and
meritlessness,
and
vexatiousness.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
does.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
the
conclusion
that
should
be
drawn
is
that
congress
did
not
want
to
exclude
prevailing
defendants
from
ever
receiving
an
attorney's
fee
award,
and
in
order
to
not
to
exclude
them
and
to
provide
for
disincentive
for
frivolous
litigation
it
included
the
prevailing
party
language.
mr.
justice
powell
asked
me
yesterday,
whether
congress
would
ever
use
this
language
and
nevertheless
mean
that
there
should
be
two
different
standards,
but
in
fact
congress
has
repeatedly
done
exactly
that
in
the
statutes
which
are
pointed
out
in
the
lawyers'
committee
brief
for
example
ranging
from
consumer
protection
to
marine
pollution,
congress
used
exactly
this
prevailing
language
and
nevertheless
meant
to
imply
two
different
standards
-
one
for
the
plaintiffs
and
one
for
the
defendants.
and
more
importantly
congress
relied
upon
this
interpretation
in
the
76
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
act
that
was
comprehensive
legislation
intended
to
parallel
the
1964
act,
congress
tracked
the
language
of
706
(k)
and
explicitly
stated
that
fee
should
only
be
awarded
where
the
plaintiffs'
suit
was
frivolous,
vexatious
or
brought
for
harassment
purposes.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
mean,
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
which
are
set
out
in
the
brief,
not
in
the
statute,
they
use
the
same
language
in
the
statute
as
they
did
in
706
(k),
but
they
made
clear
in
the
legislative
history
as
explicitly
as
one
could,
that
the
intended
fees
only
to
be
awarded
on
the
standard.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
fee
awards
ordinarily
be
made
in
favor
of
a
successful
plaintiff
according
to
newman
versus
piggie
park.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
fee
awards
are
ordinarily
--
under
the
newman
rule
that
were
ordinarily
made.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
mr.
justice
powell
asked
i
think
whether
court
in
its
discretion
could
ever
take
into
consideration
these
other
factors.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
when
the
defendant
had
prevailed?
right,
i
suppose
and
i
thought
you
just
asked
me
what
does
the
plaintiff
prevail?
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
may
be
this
way,
you
know
if
--
i
think
this
is
part
of
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
eeoc
brings
what
the
criteria
might
be,
whether
it
is
unreasonable
action
okay,
by
the
eeoc.
and
some
court
might
in
deciding
whether
the
eeoc
was
unreasonable
in
bringing
the
suit.
look
at
the
question
whether,
besides
of
this
defendant.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
whole
thrust
of
what
these
fee
awards
are
supposed
to
do,
but
that
--
it
has
been
done
and
that
is
really
what
i
was
saying.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
have
not
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
has
skillfully
brought
me
to
the
point
where
i
have
to
say
that
if
a
court
took
into
consideration
the
attorney,
the
size,
as
i
was
trying
to
state
generally,
the
size
of
the
company,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
congress
did
in
covering
the
company
and
refusing
a
normal
award
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
acts
as
a
--
according
to
title
vii
it
is
an
equitable
statute
in
general.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
powell
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
said
that
the
only
that
--
and
i
think
this
is
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
--
is
that
if
the
indices
that
were
associated
with
the
fee
award
when
congress
articulated,
what
its
purposes
were?
were
-
indices
of
bad
faith
and
frivolousness,
and
congress
did
not
include
in
that
small
businesses
and
other
kinds
of
concerns.
there
is
discretionary
fee
award
language,
courts
have
appeals,
in
applying
this
rule
have
looked
to
the
other
language
to
these
other
concerns,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
would
upset
a
case
in
equipoise
then
i
think
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress'
purposes.
i
think
that
is
what
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
here.
the
double
standard
that
the
court
found
to
be,
the
dissenting
judge
found
to
be
unfair,
we
think
is
not
unfair
because
this
statute
has
a
particular
purpose.
it
is
to
implement
title
vii's
policies,
and
plaintiffs
and
defendants
are
it
differently
situated
with
respect
to
those
policies,
and
while
our
plaintiffs
are
having
enforcement
rules,
defendants
do
not
have
that
enforcement
rule.
therefore
congress
could
have
precluded
prevailing
defendants
from
ever
obtaining
a
fee
award,
but
made
a
different
choice,
and
decided
that
in
cases
one
justified
abusive
frivolous
litigation,
fee
awards
could
be
made,
and
that
is
the
bounds
that
congress
struck
and
that
is
the
bounds
that
we
think
should
be
sustained.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
certainly
is.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
he
has,
but
what
our
problem
is
it
is
not
deciding
what
would
be
a
good
rule,
but
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
passed
the
1964
act,
its
concern
was
providing
incentive
for
plaintiffs.
it
had
raised
no
concern
of
providing
an
incentive
to
defendants;
it
probably
presumes
that
defendants
have
the
enough
incentive
to
defend
against
title
vii
litigation.
so
interpreting
what
congress
said
as
apposed
to
what
might
be
considered
to
be
a
good
rule,
congress
seemed
to
intend
the
good
faith
standard.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
except
it,
all
they
had
another
concern
and
that
was
to
prevent
frivolous
and
abusive
litigation;
they
want
this
process
to
be
abused
and
that
is
why
they
have
provided
prevailing
parties
for
awards.
they
have
done
this
as
i
say
in
numerous
other
statutes
including
the
parallel
legislation
of
the
1976
act.
they
had
to
do
this
for
another
reason
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
cost
would
not
be
allowed
against
the
united
states
in
the
absence
because
of
28
u.
s.
c.
2412,
cost
would
not
be
allowed
against
the
united
states
under
the
equitable
rules,
so
to
provide
against,
to
stop
frivolous
actions,
to
provide
fees
against
the
united
states
they
had
to
pass
the
prevailing
party
language.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
but
they
intended
to
allow
attorney's
fees
against
the
united
states.
they
needed
the
prevailing
party
--
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
in
what
sense
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
you.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
the
legislative
history
there
are
only
about
four
statements
-
one
is
senator
humphrey's
statement
saying
that
we
want
to
encourage
private
litigation
and
that
was
made
when
he
introduced
the
amendment
to
the
bill.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
if
there
was
no
legislative
history,
i
would
then
look
to
the
purposes
of
title
vii,
and
the
statutory
scheme,
and
the
legislative
history
would
seem
to
be
to
encourage
the
elimination
of
discrimination.
i
think
what
we
have
is
some
remarks
on
the
floor,
a
legislative
scheme
which
was
designed
as
this
court
said
in
newman
to
encourage
private
enforcement.
we
have
subsequent
parallel
legislation
in
the
1976
act.
we
have
the
same
use
of
similar
language
in
other
statutes
by
congress,
all
those
indicate
as
we
think
point
in
the
same
direction
and
that
is
that
the
court
and
that
the
congress
intended
when
it
used
this
language
to
set
up
one
rule
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
the
good
faith
rule
for
prevailing
defendants.
that
is
our
best
estimate
of
what
congress
intended
based
upon
all
these
legislative
indicators.
thank
you.
