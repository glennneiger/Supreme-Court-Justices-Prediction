mr.
finley
you
bother
me
somewhat
with
your
distinction
between
necessary
and
unnecessary
surgery.
what
about
cosmetic
surgery,
a
child
has
disfiguring
facial
scar,
it
is
necessary,
would
you
say
a
mother
cannot
consent
to
this.
what
about
your
person
these
days
and
when
you
say
tonsillectomy
is
necessary,
i
question,
that
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
medical
opinion
these
days,
then
in
certain
cases.
tonsillectomy
is
not
all
necessary.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
if
she
had
fatal
cancer
in
her
tubes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
you
are
saying
that
there
was
no
personal
jurisdiction
until
a
guardian
was
appointed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
if
there
had
been
a
guardian
appointed
there
and
then
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
