mr.
fruechtenicht
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
there
is
only
a
single
judge
in
that
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
important
issue,
garcia
is
the
scope
of
this
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
some
limitation
on
that,
if
it
is
not
the
assigned
to
some
other
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
not
have
probate
jurisdiction
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
would
be
some
jurisdiction
that
he
would
not
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
are
no
other
layers
of
courts
in
the
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
mrs.
mcfarlin
had
presented
a
piece
of
paper
to
your
client,
the
judge
and
said
my
daughter
is
incompetent,
she
is
a
kleptomaniac,
she
has
done
a
lot
of
shoplifting
and
i
want
your
approval
to
have
her
right
hand
chopped
off
and
the
judge
had
signed
the
approval
and
that
surgery
had
been
performed,
would
your
argument
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
assume
that
this
court
did
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
it,
you
say
that
a
parent
can
have
surgery
done
on
behalf
of
the
child
and
here
let
us
assume
in
my
case,
that
the
court
had
order
that
operation
on
that
representation
by
the
parent.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
think
it
cast
your
argument.
if
i
may
say
so--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
there
a
statute
in
your
state
against
mutilation,
is
there
statutes
in
most
states
against
the
mutilation
of
the
human
body.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
concede
that
this
action
was
inappropriate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
mother
said
she
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
think
this
improved
this
trial
physically,
this
operation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
physician?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
legislature
has
appointed
the
natural
parents
as
the
guardian
ad
litem
for
the
minor
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
for
the
doctors
insisted
to
perform
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
if
he
had
taken
testimony
somebody
by
now
would
have
said
so
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
some
states,
if
you
know
which
require
that
on
an
application
for
sterilization,
that
a
panel
of
physicians
must
be
a
designated
to
advise
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
finley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
you
would
not
rule
out
the
historic
power
of
it.
the
court
of
the
equity
to
enter
ex
parte
injunction,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
addition
there
is
no
adversary
proceeding
there,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
temporary
restraining
order,
certainly
the
state
where
i
practiced,
and
which
i
thought
followed
the
federal
rules,
up
until
the
mid
60’s
when
those
rules
were
amended,
you
could
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice
to
adverse
party,
was
it
had
to
be
returnable
in
three
days.
but,
you
could
get
it
without
notice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
sometimes
that
is
judicial
act,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
could
actually
be
a
tro
then,
tro
may
impede
a
very
important
act
that
causes
damage
to
someone
and
whether
the
particular
court
jurisdiction
requires
a
three
day
return
or
five
day,
nevertheless,
the
tro
could
be
granted
on
the
same
kind
of
representations
on
petitions
as
represented
here,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
tro,
if
you
call
it,
total
secrecy
or
in
chambers
or
ex-parte,
a
tro
is
usually
entered
that
way,
is
it
not?
you
go
in
to
the
judge
in
chambers
and
you
present
an
affidavit
and
an
order
and
if
he
is
persuaded
by
the
affidavit,
and
the
representation
was
made,
he
will
perhaps
restrain
some
act
that
causes
someone
a
great
deal
of
damage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
one
o'
clock.
you
may
continue
mr.
finley.
before
you
do,
let
me
give
you
a
corollary
to
the
question
i
put
at
the
noon
break.
i
think
there,
i
had
a
man
in
jehovah’s
witness
in
the
hospital
who
declined
the
--,
there
was
injunction
to
enjoin
the
giving
of
a
your
blood
transfusion
and
he
died.
now,
suppose
you
have
the
opposite
it
is
the
blood
transfusion,
hospital
petitions
for
authority
to
give
the
blood
transfusion
in
order
to
save
the
man’s
life,
and
judge
having
jurisdiction,
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
generally
issues,
the
order
requiring
him
to
take
the
blood
transfusion,
that
could
be
a
battery,
i
assume
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
you
had
a
kind
of
situation
you
have
here,
is
the
jurisdiction
immunity
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
suppose
it
is
an
ex-parte.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
transfusion
is
given
an
hour
after
the
paper
is
presented
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
has
it
in
his
pocket,
petition
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
at
all
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
grants
that
consent
of
the
mother
who
is
by
law
the
guardian
ad
litem
has
he
not
given
constructive
notice
to
the
minor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
then,
are
not
you,
is
that
the
judge
made
a
judicial
error.
he
did
not
have
that
law
or
rule
that
you
refer
in
to
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
get
the
impression
from
something
you
said
that
this
consent
approval
of
the
judge
really
was
not
necessary
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
cast
that
in
terms
of
judicial
duty,
he
had
a
judicial
duty
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
your
response
equivalent
to
saying
that
he
made
a
judicial
error
in
not
appointing
the
guardian
ad
litem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
he
signed
an
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
he
signed,
you
call
it
a
piece
paper
or
he
signed
something
approving
or
else
if
he
did
not
sign
anything
improving
it
then
he
is
not
should
be
in
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
indiana
statute,
accompanying
the
one
that
you
have
been
referring
to
in
the
arguments
here
that
provides
that
if
the
interest
of
the
minor
child
are
adverse
to
those
who
are
the
parents,
or
who
are
the
parents
to
the
minor
child,
then
the
statute
is
not
applicable
and
the
guardian
ad
litem
must
be
appointed.
in
other
words
is
there
any
law
of
indiana
that
required
him
to
appoint
the
guardian
ad
litem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
talking
about
something
quite
different
from
that,
suppose
it
was
a
17-year-old
girl
who
was
a
christian
science
convert
and
protested
against
surgery,
could
the
parents
consent
to
having
her
appendix
removed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
stump
against
sparkman
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
white,
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
