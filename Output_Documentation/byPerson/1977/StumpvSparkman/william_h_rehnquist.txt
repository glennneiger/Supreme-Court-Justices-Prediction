justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
principal
judicial
immunity
does
not
apply
to
an
ex
parte
and
ex
parte
decision
by
the
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
are
not
saying
that
the
judicial
immunity
does
not
apply
to
an
ex
parte
decision,
you
are
saying
he
must
have
a
case
before
him
or
be
it
perhaps
it
maybe
decided
on
an
ex
parte
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
that
answer
does
not
necessarily
make
a
good
deal
of
sense
to
me.
perhaps
it
is
my
fault
rather
than
yours.
if
the
person
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
order
even
though
he
may
be
outside
of
this
state
and
never
have
been
served
with
process
or
in
the
state
and
never
notified
of
it,
does
that,
by
your
definition
confer
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
your
colleague's
example
of
the
settlement
of
a
minor's
personal
injury
claim,
which
i
think
it
takes
place
fairly
early
often
in
most
states,
where
the
minor's
case
is
not
even
then
filed
say
against
the
automobile
driver,
the
train
company.
but,
a
settlement
has
been
ridged
and
the
court
is
simply
called
upon
to
approve
a
settlement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
those
are
two
different
kinds
of
distinctions,
one
is
your
saying
that
there
was
no
substantive
authorization
for
the
judge
to
act
the
way
he
did
and
the
other
is
you
are
saying
there
really
was
not
even
any
judicial
act
or
case
before
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
practiced
in
indiana
for
a
number
of
years
before
taking
the
bench,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
he
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
substantive
indiana
law,
which
really
is
not
the
question
we
are
talking
about.
he
said
that
this
judge
stump
had
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
petition
and
that
was
all
it
took
to
confer
immunity.
is
not
that
what
judge
ashba
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
pierson
v
ray,
we
certainly
did
not
look
to
alabama
law
rather
than
federal
law
in
deciding
whether
judges
had
absolute
immunity.
