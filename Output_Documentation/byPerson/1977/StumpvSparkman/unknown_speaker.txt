unknown
speaker
well,
so,
would
it
be
in
my
hypothetical
case.
unknown
speaker
but
counsel,
supposing
the
petition
recited
a
different
reason
that
said
i
want
approval
of
amputation
of
the
right
arm.
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
malignant
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
the
judge
would
have
jurisdiction
on
such
a
--
unknown
speaker
so,
the
question
is
whether
he
acted
for
the
right
reason
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
example
that
justice
steward
gives
you?
unknown
speaker
but,
your
argument
is
that
if
he
did
give
consent
because
he
had
jurisdiction,
he
would
have
judicial
immunity.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question?
unknown
speaker
was
this
petition
filed
in
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
not
my
question,
is
there
any
record
in
the
court
house
that
the
petition
--
unknown
speaker
may
i
follow
up
my
question,
if
there
is
no
record
in
the
court.
no
record
of
the
date
on
which
this
order
was
entered,
how
would
one
have
appeal,
assume
this
young
woman
had
(inaudible)
this
operation,
earlier
rather
than
four
years
later?
unknown
speaker
was
this
a
judicial
act?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
young
lady
had
known
on
the
occasion
of
what
her
mother
was
doing
and
had
objected
as
vigorously
as
she
could,
the
judge
nevertheless
had
entered
this
consent,
would
she
have
had
no
recourse
to
appellate
courts
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
wait
a
minute,
you
are
saying
today
that
she
does
not
have
recourse
against
the
judge.
unknown
speaker
so,
she
would
not
be
able
to
appeal
and
she
would
not
have
any
simply
approval.
unknown
speaker
so
she
would
have
no
recourse
whatever.
unknown
speaker
or
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
whom?
unknown
speaker
the
surgeon.
but,
her
consent
indemnifies
a
physician
in
a
hospital?
unknown
speaker
i
would
do
not
think
so.
does
it
mean
that
the
mother
is
eventually,
exclusively
liable
than
her
--
unknown
speaker
under
the
indemnification
agreement.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
that
case
was
after
judge
stump
approved.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
fruechtenicht,
if
judge
stump
had
done
what
he
did
in
1966,
after
the
decision
of
the
indiana
court
in
al
against
grh
it
would
had
been
erroneous,
as
a
matter
state
law
but
it
would
not
be
in
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
would
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
argument
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
adversary
process
here
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
he
did
not
know
of
that
decision.
but,
in
any
event
if
he
had
done
what
he
did,
quite
contrary
to
the
president
of
al
against
grh,
your
argument
would
be
precisely
the
same.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
difference
between
this
preceding
and
the
gl
whatever
the
initials
are
of
the
other
case.
that
was
suit
or
a
declaratory
judgment
in
which
counsel,
guardian
was
appointed
and
counsel
--
there
was
an
adversary
proceeding.
there
was
clearly
a
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
a
suit,
this
is
a
petition
for
approval
where
there
was
nobody
appointed
of
any
kind,
you
say
approvals
are
common.
would
you
give
me
some
other
examples
of
approvals?
i
am
just
not
that
familiar.
unknown
speaker
but,
that
is
an
ancillary
to
a
pending
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
puzzles
me,
you
say
these
approvals,
ex
parte
approvals
are
common
but
each
example
you
give
is
related
to
some
more
or
less
traditional
judicial
proceedings.
if
the
judge's
view
of
the
law
were
correct
here,
his
approval
probably
was
not
necessary.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
if
i
followed
the
last
answer
that
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
for
the
judge
to
have
a
evidence
to
his
consent.
the
consent
of
the
mother
would
had
been
sufficient
in
indiana
law.
unknown
speaker
does
not
that
leave
the
court
in
position
of
performing
only
a
ministerial
act?
unknown
speaker
what
judgment
does
he
make?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
of
that?
unknown
speaker
i
have
read
the
petition,
it
says
very
little.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
know
whether
he
made
any
independent
inquiry
of
any
kind.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
can
act
on
your
presumption?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
make
the
rule
of
judicial
immunity
to
turn
on
whether
the
judge
reached
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
whether
the
surgery
was
necessary
would
not,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
but,
what
about
an
improper,
wrong
decision
on
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
not
noticed,
and
the
adverse
party
did
not
have
notice
or
that
cannot
be
cured
by
the
time,
it
is
returnable
and
you
have
your
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction.
unknown
speaker
what
about,
search
issuance
--
search
warrants
where
there
is
no
criminal
case
pending,
it
is
just
an
investigation.
unknown
speaker
it
may
never
be
any
case.
unknown
speaker
the
officers
came
into
his
house
and
he
claims
illegally,
and
he
sues
the
judge
for
a
gross
error.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
to
make
a
case
out
of
it,
all
the
judge
has
to
do
is
make
it
a
case.
he
puts
a
number
on
it
and
puts
in
the
file.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge
here
had
said
well
i
think
i
would
better
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem
before
i
pass
on
this
and
they
did
and
the
guardian
ad
litem
and
they
gave
it
a
number
and
the
guardian
ad
litem
came
in
and
opposed
it
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
am
going
to
grant
it.
would
there
be
an
immunity?
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
jurisdiction
then
to
--
perhaps
mistakenly
but
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
order.
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley
having
to
give
me
your
case
away,
because
if
i
understand
you,
the
petition
which
was
filed,
did
give
the
judge
the
power
if
he
had
thought
of
the
wise
procedure
to
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem.
could
he
not
have
done
that
on
the
base
of
this
petitions,
that
i
will
treat
this
as
a
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
upon
a
guardian?
unknown
speaker
you
rest
on
the
lack
of
a
number.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
i
had
this
very
same
petition,
this
very
same
action,
and
filed
and
taken.
except
that
was
filed
in
court
and
a
number
was
put
on
it,
would
your
case
then
be
gone?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
my
assumption
is
that
she
still
does
not
get
notice
and
the
same
unfortunate
consequences
all
follow.
the
only
difference
is
they
put
a
copy
on
the
clerk's
office.
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
one
other
case
that
has
been
turning
over
in
my
mind.supposing
the
allegation
in
the
petition
instead
of
being
that
she
was
retarded
and
promiscuous,
had
rather
been
that
she
was
infected
with
a
malignant
cancer
and
that
a
medical
judgment
of
the
doctor
was
that,
it
should
be
removed
by
this
procedure
and
then
the
judge
did
exactly
what
he
did
here
and
acting
in
all
good
faith,
do
you
think
he
was
right,
he
did
not
appoint
a
guardian,
he
did
not
file
a
paper
in
the
court
or
he
did
not
do
any
thing
else
but
later
on
it
turns
out
they
were
wrong.
would
he
be
a
liable?
unknown
speaker
that
leads
to
wonder,
are
you
not
to,
i
think
this
is
relevant
to
your
immunity
argument
--
are
you
not
if
we
agreed
with
you
and
the
case
went
forward,
are
you
not
going
to
have
in
showing
damages,
are
you
not
going
to
have
show
that
his
act
was
really
sort
of
an
important
factor
in
this
procedure
and
that
perhaps
the
doctor
required
a
judicial
consent
or
that
he
really
was
not
an
instrumental
in
producing
this
consequences?
unknown
speaker
well
and
also
that
judge's
action
was
approximate
cause
of
the
operation.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
suppose
anybody
went
to
the
judge?
because
the
doctor
wanted
it
or
what?
unknown
speaker
so
the
doctor
required
a
judicial
act.
unknown
speaker
so,
at
least
of
the
act,
the
parties
who
were
acting
here
wanted
a
judicial
act,
something
that
would
pass
for
one.
unknown
speaker
it
might
be
fatal.
suppose
it
is
a
temporary
restraining
order
that
restrains
the
giving
of
the
blood
transfusion,
do
you
remember
jehovahâ€™s
witnesses
and
the
patient
dies
as
a
result
of
it
in
a
three
day
period.
unknown
speaker
and
is
under
action
of
a
court
or
a
judge
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
take
a
pause
there
--supposing
he
had
taken
all
of
those
opportunities,
would
that
have
made
this
a
judicial
act?
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
people
were
brought
in
front
him.
unknown
speaker
supposing
he
spend
a
couple
hours
in
his
chambers
with
the
lawyers
and
said
do
we
really
have
the
authority
to
do
this.
is
it
really
appropriate
for
me
to
do
and
they
talked
it
over
and
they
looked
at
the
law,
and
they
spent
the
time
doing
at.
then
they
said
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
notice,
and
he
says
no
it
really
will
not
help
because
she
is
retarded
or
whatever
he
said,
they
talked
it
all
through.
he
nevertheless
entered
the
order.
it
would
still
not
have
been
a
judicial
act.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
not
an
institutionalized
individual.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
way
under
the
law
of
the
indiana
where
had
there
been
good
grounds
to
do
so
that
this
child
could
have
been
sterilized?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
the
law
would
never
permit
it
under
any
circumstances,
i
just
wonder
if
that
is
right,
judge
ashba
(ph)
did
not
think
that.
he
is
a
pretty
good
indiana
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
and
really,
the
indiana
case
you
cite
does
not
say
that,
that
says
the
particular
reason
given
there
was
insufficient
even
though
the
parents
sincerely
believed
it
was.
unknown
speaker
but
that
case
does
not
hold
it
is
never
permissible.
unknown
speaker
essentially
then
we
must
disagree
with
judge
ashpa
on
the
indiana
jurisdiction
consent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
i
am
sorry
but
i
just
have
to
ask
one
another
question,
you
said
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not
have
personal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
but,
how
did
they
get
personal
jurisdiction
in
a.l.
v
g.r.h.?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
jurisdiction
to
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
make
that
argument,
i
take
it
and
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
this
order
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
judge
ashba
said
he
had
jurisdiction
but
you
would
say,
well,
even
if
he
did,
he
did
not
act
as
a
judge.
he
did
not
do
any
of
the
things
that
the
judge
would
do.
unknown
speaker
and
you
also
say
he
had
no
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
now,
would
you
say
that,
just
so
i
get
your
position,
suppose
the
statutes
of
indiana
said
no
district
judge
shall
have
any
jurisdiction
what
so
ever
to
approve
or
purport
approve
a
sterilization.
and
then
a
petition
is
filed
with
a
judge,
the
judge
looks
at
it,
he
gives
it
a
number
and
he
approves
it.
it
is
utterly
wrong
and
he
should
have
known
he
was
wrong,
immunity
or
not?
