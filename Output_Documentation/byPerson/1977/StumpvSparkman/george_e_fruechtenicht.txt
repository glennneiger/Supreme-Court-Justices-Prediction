mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
please.
as
the
documents
indicate,
i
represent
the
harold
stump
petitioner
in
this
matter.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
sir.
i
represent
herald
stump
and
i
would
like
to
identify
my
client.
he
is
the
circuit
court
judge
of
the
dekalb
county
indiana.
the
dekalb
county
lies
on
the
north
eastern
part
of
the
state
just
next
to
ohio
about
30,000
residents
occupy
the
county.
county
of
cedar
(ph),
auburn,
town
of
about
six
thousand
people
that
is
where
the
courthouse
is.
judge
lives
there,
that
is
where
he
works.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes.
the
action
occurred
your
honor
in
1971
and
at
that
time
he
was
the
sole
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
he
has
been
elected
four
times
and
is
now
serving
his
20th
year.
his
father
walter
stump
serves
has
a
circuit
court
judge
on
the
same
bench
for
12
years
before
him.
judge
stump
is
a
judge
of
a
considerable
experience
and
i
will
indicate
to
this
court,
a
judge
of
the
highest
integrity.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
issue,
the
principal
issue
is
what
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
should
be
applied
to
and
approval
signed
by
judge
stump
of
a
petition
filed
by
the
mother
and
sole
guardian
of
the
15
year
old
girl
to
have
surgery
performed
upon
her
,that
surgery
was
a
tubal
ligation.
the
larger
issue
i
would
submit
to
this
court
would
be
whether
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
should
be
permitted
to
be,
in
my
view,
diluted
and
altered
by
the
pronouncements
of
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeal.
the
context
in
which
the
matter
was
presented
or
is
has
presented,
the
factual
background,
so,
far
as
the
judge
is
concerned
is
as
follows:
the
mother
ora
mcfarlin,
determined
that
apparently
because
of
facts
set
out
in
a
petition,
her
daughter
15-years
old
should
have
tubal
ligation.
the
petition
speaks
for
itself,
it
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents
along
with
the
approval.
briefly,
it
suggests
or
alleges
under
oath
that
the
daughter
is
sexually
promiscuous
that
she
has
been
uncontrollable,
that
the
mother
is
concerned.
obviously,
that
the
daughter
is
going
to
become
pregnant
and
that
for
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
she
asks
that
the
court
approve
a
petition
by
the
mother
to
have
tubal
ligation
performed
upon
her.
when
that
petition
was
presented
to
the
court
by
the
mother
and
her
attorney,
the
court
then
was
required
to
make
a
primary
threshold
decision
and
that
was
whether
or
not
he
had
jurisdiction
to
approve
that
petition.
i
submit
to
the
court
and
made
this
decision
as
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
in
every
county,
every
day
throughout
this
country
must
make
in
matters
of
this
particular
type.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
am
talking
about
--
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
your
honor
required
to
make
decision
of
this
particular
type
in
every
county
throughout.
at
that
time
the
court
realized
that
he
had
a
general
jurisdiction
statute
under
which
he
functioned
and
that
general
jurisdiction
statute
in
broad
language,
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
the
city
of
indiana
and
to
this
date
unamended,
indicates
that
he
shall
have
original
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
that
law
and
equity
and
whatsoever
and
he
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
all
other
causes,
matters
and
proceedings.
also
in
existence
of
that.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
am
sorry,
yes
sir
your
honor.
thereof,
if
it
is
not
conferred
were
exclusive
jurisdiction
thereof
is
not
conferred
by
law
upon
some
other
court
board
or
office
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
he
would.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
he
would
in
this
case.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
cannot
think
of
it,
except
where
jurisdiction
has
been
specifically
proscribed
whether
has
been
a
bar
either
by
common
law
or
by
legislation
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
a
county
has
hat
it
all
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
none.
he
has
criminal
jurisdiction,
juvenile
jurisdiction,
he
has
civil
jurisdiction,
he
has
the
general
jurisdiction
overall
causes,
matters
and
proceedings.
with
this
in
mind,
also
there
were
not
jurisdictional
statutes
in
existence
but
there
was
statutes
in
existence
on
the
state
of
the
indiana
at
that
time
which
in
general
terms
permitted
parents
to
consent
to
medical
treatment
on
behalf
of
their
minor
children.
there
are
two
such
statutes,
one
for
people
who
are
incompetent
by
reason
of
minority
and
insanity,
mental
illness,
imbecility,
idiocies,
senility,
habitual
drunkenness
and
the
like.
and
the
other
is
simply
any
person
who
is
the
parent
of
the
child
shall
be
competent
to
give
consent
to
and
contract
from
medical
or
hospital
care
or
treatment
of
such
child
including
surgery.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
your
honor,
judge
swagger
(ph),
i
must
remark
on
the
apparel,
he
said
both
of
her
hands
got
off,
when
we
are
arguing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
would
not
be
an
operation
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
court
would
even
consider
especially
a
court
such
judge
stump.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
if
he
did
do
that.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
your
honor
that
assumption
is
going
to
lend,
it
is
not
going
to,
it
is
not
your
meaning
to
the
issues.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
it
certainly
does.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
if
there
is
your
honor
i
am
aware
of
it.
i
am
aware
of
it,
in
answers
to
your
questions
your
honor
that
would
be
in
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
it
is
certainly
not
before
us.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
this
statute
your
honor
is
a
medical
care
statute.
your
premise
was
she
was
a
kleptomaniac.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
certainly
cutting
off
her
hands
is
not
going
to
improve
her
physically.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
think
your
honor
that
decision
was
made
and
that
except
from
the
stand
point
improving
her
physically
it
was
at
least
surgery.
and
at
least
surgery
on
these
circumstances
is
permitted
by
the
statute
and
it
is
within
the
context
of
that
statute
that
this
particular
approval
was
made.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
then
you
are
entitled
that
conclusion
your
honor.
this
is
one
that
i
most
certainly
do
not
conclude
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
of
this
court's
experience
would
entertain
such
as
petition.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
he
would.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
not
the
question,
the
final
question
your
honor
is
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
to
act
at
all.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
of
chopping
off
the
hands.
in
the
final
analysis,
yes
he
would
have
jurisdiction
to
act.
now
what
he
would
do
i
am
suggesting
however,
in
those
certain
chances
is
refuse.
he
would
refuse
to
consent.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
this
was
not
action
at
law
or
in
equity
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
he
did
not.
he
got
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
general
jurisdiction
statute,
which
permits
him
to
have
jurisdiction
of
all
other
matters,
causes
and
proceedings.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
i
would
assume
so,
if
there
such
a
thing
in
dekalb
county
indiana,
i
think
they
have
some
streams
there
that
are
navigable.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
they
do.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
i
believe
that
is
defined
by
a
law
an
alien
law
that
can
float.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no,
that
is
federal
a
law.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
of
course
not.
he
has
jurisdiction
over
receiver
ships,
the
receiver
ships
those
are
in
south
east.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
do
not
think
that
is
jurisdiction
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
because
there
has
to
be
some
reason
for
him
to
be
presented
with
the
petition.
he
cannot
simply
sit
back
and
say
this
morning,
i
think
i
will
have
simply
somebody
sterilized.
the
matter
obviously
must
be
presented
to
him.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
by
whom?
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
okay.
the
petition,
the
petition
would
set
forth,
why
the
sterilization
should
occur?
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
well
obviously,
the
difference
that
you
are
suggesting
is
that
john
jones
is
not
the
natural
parent
and
guardian
of
mary
smith.
in
this
particular
case
the
mother
was
the
natural
parent
and
guardian
of
this
lady
and
she
asks
whether
or
not
the
court
would
approve.
he
did
not
order
anything,
he
simply
approved
this.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
on
her
own?
at
that
particular
time
obviously,
the
court
concluded
that
she
could
have.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
do
not
know.
perhaps
that
is
simply
the
context
in
which
this
approved.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
in
1971
there
was
neither
a
statute
authorizing
nor
was
there
a
statute
barring
such
a
procedure
your
honor
and
that
is
significant.
that
is
significant
in
this
particular
case.
may
i
suggest
this
to
you?
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
the
case
that
we
have
cited
is,
this
is
a
matter
of
which
is
really
not
to
do
with
sterilization.
this
is
a
matter
to
you
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
should
apply
under
these
circumstances.
when
this
petition
was
presented
to
this
court,
he
was
duty
bound
at
that
particular
point
to
the
determine
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
particular
case,
to
act
in
this
case
that
is
the
issue
an
approval.
and
that
source,
that
power
flows
from
the
cases
in
indiana
and
they
come
basically
from
bradley
vs.
fisher
which
says
this,
“every
court
possesses
the
power
of
determining
its
own
jurisdiction
both
as
to
the
parties
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
action.”
it
is
well
settled
that
when
an
inferior
tribunal
is
required
to
ascertain
and
decide
upon
facts
essential
to
its
jurisdiction,
its
judgment
there
on
is
conclusive
against
collateral
attack.
unless
the
want
of
jurisdiction
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
his
jurisdiction,
i
repeat
again
your
honor
lies
in
the
general
jurisdiction
statute
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
district
court
which
gives
him
jurisdiction
over
all
other
causes,
matters
and
proceedings.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
cannot
be
certain.
it
has
appellate
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
think
it
has
original
the
jurisdiction
of
this
type,
it
may
have.
but
may
i
suggest
this,
or
may
i
offer
this
also
your
honor
that
in
1971,
the
parental
consent
statutes
had
not
in
any
way
been
construed
by
any
court.
in
other
words
they
had
not
been
amended
by
legislation
nor
had
any
court
construed
the
consent
statute
so
as
to
prohibit
a
certain
types
of
surgery.
so,
when
you
say
was
there
a
statute
permitting
a
tubal
ligation,
nor
was
there
a
statute
permitting
the
judge
to
consent
in
to
appendectomy
or
a
tonsillectomy.
none
of
that,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
not
a
statute
which
said
he
could
not
consent
to
that,
he
could
not
issue
an
approval
of
such
and
once
again
keep
in
mind
this
was
not
an
order.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
you
may.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
this
petition
was
presented
to
the
judge
your
honor
and
any
suggestion
that
it
was
not
is
totally
without
base.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no,
sir.
i
would
like
to
respond
that
at
the
later
time
but
i
shall
do
so
now.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
that
condition
makes
it
some
sort
of
proceeding
that
is
not
the
case
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
this
does
is
not
carry
a
cause
number
but
that
is
not
unusual
occurrence.
approvals
of
documents
which
are
submitted
to
circuit
courts,
frequently
do
not
carry
any
sort
of
a
file
marking.
they
are
not
adversary
proceedings;
example
would
be,
in
minor
state
it
is
customary
before
a
settlement
is
approved
that
a
petition
is
prepared,
the
minor
is
absent
presented
to
the
court
and
although
the
thing
maybe
numbered.
there
is
certainly
no
adversary
proceeding
and
it
is
not
an
adversary
cause,
simply
decided
in
the
absence
of
the
minor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no,
need
not
be.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no,
sir.
he
did
not
be.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
his
natural
guardian
your
honor,
presents
in
the
form
of
his
mother
or
his
father
comes
to
the
court
and
under
oath
advises
the
court
that
she
or
he
thinks
that
the
settlement
is
proper
and
the
court
approves
the
settlement.
same
way,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
so,
far
as
i
know
your
honor
approvals
are
not
appealed
because
they
are
not
orders.
this
was
simply
an
approval,
there
was
no
appeal.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
sir.
it
was
certainly
the
judicial
act.
it
was
presented
to
the
judge,
as
a
judge
signed
by
him
as
judge.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
of
course
that
did
not
happen,
did
it?
but,
supposing
if
it
had.
she
would
not
have
had
recourse
your
honor
from
the
action
of
the
judge.
she
has
sued
seven
people,
one
of
the
defendants
is
the
judge.
she
would
have
her
state
court
action
as
she
possesses
today.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct,
it
was
simply
an
approval.
this
was
not
on
appealable
order
and
there
was
no
other.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
against
the
judge.
no,
sir
she
would
not.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes,
she
would.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
those
people
who
would
have
presumed
to
act
to
her
mother,
who
would
presume
that
she
has
(inaudible)
to
a
state
court
action.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
of
course
is
an
agreement
between
the
mother
and
surgeon
and
a
contract
between
the
two
of
them.
i
do
not
think
that
that
binds
the
daughter.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
exclusively
liable?
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
suppose
it
depends
upon
whether
the
indemnification
agreement
is
forcible.
i
would
not
prejudge
that
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
may
suggest
this
also
and
perhaps
i
would
stop
suggesting,
and
just
simply
advise
what
our
positions
is.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
known
to
the
court.
the
operation
did
occur,
it
was
not
disclosed
to
this
girl
by
her
mother
that
it
was
tubal
ligation,
she
was
told
it
was
an
appendectomy.
the
girl
married,
a
couple
of
years
later
and
approximately
four
years
after
the
incident
occurred
sometime
in
1975,
through
investigation
it
was
disclosed
that
indeed
a
tubal
ligation
had
occurred,
that
is
when
an
action
was
commenced
in
the
federal
district
court
under
42
usc
1983.
in
which
the
mother
was
sued
along
with
judge,
the
lawyer,
and
three
doctors
and
the
hospital.
the
opinion
of
the
federal
district
court
is
the
one
which
this
petitioner
feels
should
be
restored
because
that
opinion
deals
with
this
problem,
we
think
appropriately
and
correctly
applies
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
the
federal
district
judge
ashba
(ph)
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
that
this
being
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
that
court
being
entitled
to
entertain
all
types
of
causes,
matters
and
proceedings.
most
specifically
undertook
this
act
all
be
it
not
in
an
adversary
proceedings,
undertook
this
act
with
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
an
order,
it
was
simply
an
approval.
approvals
occur
with
frequency,
that
court
summed
up,
i
think.
well,
i
would
like
to
read
“except
when
there
is
clear
absence
of
all
jurisdictions
over
the
subject
matter,
a
judge
is
entitled
to
complete
immunity
to
sue
based
upon
his
official
acts
and
absolute
immunity
defeats
a
suit
at
the
outset
so
long
as
the
official's
actions
were
within
the
scope
of
the
immunity.
the
allegedly
wrongful
acts
committed
by
judge
stump,
consisted
solely
in
his
approval
of
the
petition
filed
in
this
court
by
defendant
mcfarlin.
the
circuit
courts
of
the
indiana
are
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
having
a
original
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
of
law
on
equity
whatsoever.
there
is
jurisdiction
in
such
a
court
to
hear
petitions
for
tubal
ligation,
a.l.
vs
g.r.h.
by
implication
although
the
court
there
held
that
on
the
merits
the
sterilization
could
not
be
thus
consented
to.
but,
whether
or
not
judge
stump’s
approval
of
the
petition
may
in
retrospect
appear
to
have
been
premised
on
erroneous
view
of
the
law.
judge
stump
surely
had
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
petition
and
to
act
there
on.
accordingly
judge
stump
is
closed
with
absolute
judicial
immunity
and
neither
he
nor
his
alleged
co-conspirators
maybe
held
liable
under
sections
1983,
1985
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
your
honors
to
which
the
judge
made
reference,
a.l.
vs
g.r.h.,
was
a
case
of
first
impression
in
indiana,
decided
four
years
after
the
judge
entered
his
approval.
that
is
1975.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct,
after
judge
stump's
approval.
that
case
was
brought
because
there
obviously
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
parent
could
consent
under
the
consent
statute
to
have
a
tubal
ligation
performed
upon
a
minor
child.
in
that
case
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
filed
and
indiana
then
determined
as
matter
of
policy,
the
court
of
indiana
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
they
did
not
think
any
body
under
any
circumstances
could
be
sterilized.
it
joined
a
number
of
other
states
but
once
again,
that
decision,
once
again
did
not
remove
the
jurisdiction
from
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
from
judge
stump
to
consider
further
petitions
of
this
type
all
it
did
was
say,
if
somebody
walked
into
judge
stump
today
with
a
petition
to
have
a
tubal
ligation
performed
on
a
minor,
he
would
have
to
act
upon
it
because
he
has
the
jurisdiction
to
act
upon
it
but
his
action
would
be,
i
am
now
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
indiana
there
is
a
policy
against
permitting
parents
to
do
so
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
cannot
approve
your
petition.
but,
the
key
to
this
is
that
he
retains
jurisdiction
and
i
have
suggested
in
the
brief
and
suggest
to
you
now,
the
policy
which
has
been
established
by
bradley
v
fisher,
randall
v
brigham
over
a
century
ago
and
consistently
applied
by
the
federal
courts
down
to
this
time
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
similar
at
least
in
my
view
after
reading
all
of
these
cases
to
the
policy
which
is
employed
by
courts
when
dealing
with
criminally
accused
people.
and
that
is
the
accused
is
considered
innocent
until
proved
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
policy
with
respect
to
judicial
immunity
is
that
the
court
is
presumed
to
have
jurisdiction
until
it
is
shown
that
he
acted
in
clear
absence
of
all
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
my
argument
would
be
yes.
but,
under
those
circumstances
i
would
simply
say
that
to
assume
that
a
judge
of
this
experience,
under
these
conditions
who
would
do
that
is
beyond
at
this
my
imagination.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
precisely,
and
i
would
say
this
with
respect
to
the
liability
your
honor
of
those
additional
parties
that
under
those
circumstances
then,
the
mother
must
be
construed
to
be
dealing
at
her
parole
as
the
doctors
because
there
are
presumed
to
know
the
law
also.
so,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
right,
i
have
given
you
the
example
where
by
a
parent
will
come
in
to
the
court
and
simply
petition
the
court
that
he
wants
a
sum
of
money
approved
by
the
court
as
being
reasonable
to
take
care
of
the
minor's
injury
based
upon
the
parents.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
no,
that
is
ancillary
to
settling
a
case,
the
case
may
not
even
have
been
tried,
frequently
they
are
not.
a
minor
is
run
over
by
an
automobile.
separates
a
broken
leg,
$2500
is
agreed
upon,
goes
in
the
court.
the
minor
never
even
shows
up.
approvals
as
far
as,
your
getting
at
it,
i
think
your
honor,
the
failure
to
point
a
guardian
ad
litem
for
this
girl.
i
must
suggest
that
in
every
case
where
a
mother
decides
to
sue
her
husband
and
where
there
are
children,
those
children
automatically
through
the
mother
come
under
the
egs
of
the
court
and
he
makes
dispositions
of
those
children's
future
interests
which
are
extremely
important
to
that
child.
to
suggest,
as
i
think
maybe
the
logical
inference
of
this
suggestion
that
guardian
ad
litem
are
to
be
appointed
to
suggest
that
an
each
case
where
a
child
is
the
subject
a
matter
having
to
do
with
visitation
and
custody
and
its
future
religious
practices
in
a
divorce
action.
that
that
child,
each
individual
child
is
entitled
to
a
guardian
ad
litem
and
presumably
an
attorney
would
boggle
the
entire
system.
courts
customarily
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
children
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct
your
honor
in
many
instances.
as
an
example
also
i
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief,
when
under
age
people
come
and
they
want
to
get
married
and
they
are
under
the
age
of
consent.
they
can
go
before
the
circuit
court
judge
either
by
written
or
oral
petition
and
he
can
approve
that
under
age
marriage,
there
is
no
file
marking.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
yes
sir,
there
is
statute
which
provides
it.
but,
you
honor
that
simply
establishes
the
fact
that
a
judge
can
function
under
many,
many
general
circumstances
absent
which
we
would
consider
to
be
the
formality
of
an
adversary
proceedings.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
that
is
correct.
all
i
can
do
is
surmise,
we
have
had
no
evidence
in
this
case
your
honor.surmise
that
this
is
the
context
in
which
mrs.
mcfarlin
and
her
attorney
determined
that
they
wished
this
consent
to
be
made.
they
wished
the
court
to
approve.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
perhaps,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
perhaps.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
a
careful
reading
of
these
statutes
your
honor
does
not--
these
statutes
with
respect
to
consent
by
the
parent
do
not
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
court,
these
are
not
jurisdictional
statutes.
they
simply
permit
the
parent
to
consent
to
surgery,
and
so
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
there
was
a
verified
petition
presented
to
him.
this
is
a
very
careful
in
conscientious
judge.
this
mother
was
faced
with
a
very
real
situation
at
least
in
her
lifetime,
and
he
made
a
determination
that
would
be
for
the
best
interest
of
the
child
if
these
occurred.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
there
is
an
evidence
of
the
verified
petition
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
well,
what
it
did
say,
it
least
said.
remember
this
is
a
county
of
30,000
people.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
we
do
not
know
that
he
did
not
either
your
honor.
i
would
presume
that
he
did
because
of
the
fact
that
he
has
jurisdiction
to
do
so,
but
the
general
jurisdiction
statute.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
would
prefer.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
do
not
know.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
the
testimony
was
--
if
he
did
would
be
by
a
way
of
a
verifying
petition
your
honor,
which
she
has
a
right
to
accept
this.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
of
course
it
is
a
possibility.
i
must
repeat,
the
issue
which
we
are
confronted
is
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
should
be
applied
to
this
act.
and
if
there
is
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
this
judge
to
entertain
and
approve
this
petition,
it
being
a
judicial
act,
then
he
is
clearly
entitled
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine.
the
policy
reasons
underlying
that
particular
doctrine
are
most
important
to
the
continuation
of
the
fearlessness
about
which
the
cases
like
bradley
vs.
fisher
talk
about.
thank
you.
mr.
george
e.
fruechtenicht
i
think,
indiana
would
not
permit
it
all
but
i
think
illinois
does
your
honor.
sterilization
is
permitted,
i
believe
in
illinois
under
these
specific
statutory
circumstances.
