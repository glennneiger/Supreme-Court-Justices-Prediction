mr.
richard
h.
finley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
i
believe
that
the
questioning
today
indicates
what
is
truly
the
crux
today
and
that
is
that
the
probably
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
need
not
come
in
to
play
in
your
decision.
the
question
ask
by
mr.
justice
powell
was
this
not
merely
administrative
act
as
discuss
in
ex
parte
virginia
and
non
judicial
act
as
discussed
in
several
lower
court,
federal
court
cases
probably
is
going
to
be
the
correct
and
the
logical
determining
decision
in
this
case.
the
consent
statute
which
authorized
the
parent
to
consent
to
surgery
of
a
minor
child
clearly
can
be
read
only
in
the
terms
of
common
sense,
necessary
surgery.certainly
sterilization
on
a
petition
as
filed
by
the
mother
in
this
instance,
is
not
necessary
surgery.
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
which
has
developed
on
the
kidney
transplant
cases,
for
example,
that
a
parent
just
does
not
have
the
power
to
consent
to
non
therapeutic,
none
beneficial
surgery.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
i
would
have
the
decision
be
that
the
judge
never
made
a
judicial
decision.
if
the
case
had
been
properly
presented
as
in
a.l.
vs
g.r.h.,
the
case
was
filed
with
the
court.
the
guardian
ad
litem
was
appointed
to
represent
linda,
if
attorneys
brief
and
prepared
arguments
on
each
side
and
the
court
made
a
determination
that
we
will
allow
sterilization
under
indiana
and
common
law
as
it
exists
today,
then
i
would
say
in
that
instance
your
honor
that
the
judge
made
a
mistake
but
his
is
entitled
to
immunity
for
his
action
because
he
had
subject
matter
and
i
honestly
also
believe
personal
jurisdiction
is
required.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
i
cannot
imagine
of
an
ex-parte
decision
without
some
case
or
matter
being
properly
in
front
of
a
judge.
the
examples
given
by
mr.
fruechtenicht,
all
were
ex
parte
but
they
had
in
front
him,
the
judge
had
in
front
of
him
some
case.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
sense
that
is
how
i
was
using
ex
parte.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
your
honor.
but,
in
the
injunction
or
tro,
temporary
restraining
order
circumstances
the
statute
always
provides
for
notice
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
but
notice
is
--
i
have
never
seen
a
statute
authorizing
a
temporary
restraining
orders
of
that
type
of
action
or
i
have
never
seen
an
action
outside
of
a
statute
in
an
equitable
nature,
where
notice
is
not
given
to
the
party
whose
property
is
being
restrained
or
taken
away.
and
so,
that
afterwards
the
parties
rights
are
preserved.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
but
generally
speaking
your
honor
i
would
submit
that
instance
when
it
was
returnable
within
that
three
days
before
it
was
made
permanent,
the
party
had
a
right
to
appear
and
present
his
side
of
the
story,
assuming
that
there
was
an
issue
on
which
he
wanted
evidence
presented.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
is
a
though
question
your
honor
and
my
inclination
would
probably
be
to
say
that
i
would
like
some
kind
of
qualified
immunity,
if
it
were
a
good
faith
favor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
again,
upon
the
issuance
of
that
search
warrant,
the
criminal
defendant,
if
he
ultimately
becomes
one,
he
is
going
to
have
a
chance
in
court
to
say
that
he
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
if
no
case
is
filed,
he
is
probably
not
going
to
be
permanently
deprived
of
any
right.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
do
not
believe
it
is
gross
error,
i
think
it
is
a
mistake,
i
think
that
judge
who
issued
the
warrant
ex
parte
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
that
goes
a
long
way
toward
making
it
a
judicial
act
which
under
the
judicial
immunity.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
would
be
immunity
there
until
the
statute
says,
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe,
i
have
given
the
case
away
because
the
petition
was
never
filed.
there
is
no
file
stands.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
rest
on
the
total
lack
--
if
you
are
going
to
draw
a
line
and
say
at
'x'
point
along
it
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
my
inclination
is
to
say
that
probably
it
would
be
but
that
question
is
not
in
front
us
because
in
this
instance,
linda
sparkman
was
given
absolutely
no
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
your
honor,
at
that
point
i
would
say
that
probably
a
judicial
act
occurred
and
then
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
if
under
our
law
of
judicial
immunity
as
established
by
randall
and
bradley
and
pierson
allows
for
a
determination
of
jurisdiction
with
just
subject
matter
or
also
personal
jurisdiction,
determination
without
the
presence
of
personal
jurisdiction.
my
feeling
is
that
the
language
used
in
each
one
of
this
three
cases,
although,
in
bradley
v
fisher,
they
used
the
term
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
they
really
mean
personal
jurisdiction
because
each
of
the
instances,
personal
jurisdiction
was
present.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
jurisdiction
over
the
persons,
so
as
to
preserve
that
person's
right
of
appeal
before
the
total
deprivation
of
his
due
process
rights.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
i
would
say
that
it
does
not,
i
would
say
that
the
same
rights,
the
same
basic
right
to
appeal
is
going
to
be
preserved
if
he
had
knowledge,
so
i
think
you
are
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
would
probably
have
been
technically
not
a
judicial
act
and
probably
technically
under
my
theory
there
could,
if
one
could
show
damages
be
a
cause
of
action
--yes,
sir.
against
the
judge.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
that
there
would
be
incumbent
upon
us
in
a
trial
to
convince
the
jury,
that
the
judge
had
some
reason
beyond
the
normal
judicial
reason
for
billing
what
he
did.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
because
the
doctor
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
the
doctor
wanted
the
protection
of
an
instrument
signed
by
the
judge.
i
think
that
linda,
the
facts
would
show,
was
in
the
hospital
a
few
weeks
earlier,
supposedly
for
the
purpose
of
having
her
appendix
removed
and
then
was
discharged.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
they
wanted
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
judge's
name
on
it,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
it
can
become
a
judicial
act
if
the
judge
treats
it
such
as
but
where
the
judge
did
absolutely
none
of
the
things
that
a
judge
does,
when
particularly
deciding
contrary
to
the
rights
of
an
individual,
it
is
no
longer
a
judicial
act.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
it
would
be
filed
in
court
your
honor,
and
would
ultimately
become
the
basis
of
an
appeal,
could
become
the
basis
of
an
appeal,
whereas
when
it
is
done
in
total
secrecy
there
is
no
way
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
but,
your
honor,
temporary
restraining
order
is
that
temporary.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
think
your
honor
that,
that
is
clearly
a…
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
immunity
had
the
matter
properly
had
been
petitioned
and
filed
in
the
court
of
the
judge
who
made
this
order.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
even
without
a
file
in
the
court.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
but,
it
is
contemplated
that
it
would
be
filed.i
would
say
if
it
was
contemplated
that
it
would
be
filed,
my
inclination
would
be
say
that
instance
that
there
would
be
immunity
--since
i
would
at
that
point,
i
think
it
was
probably
a
judicial
act.
i
think
that
differs
from
the
instant
case
because
there
was
no
contemplation
i
believe
your
honor
in
a
filing
of
the
case
in
sparkman’s
court.
i
think
that
that
goes
to
the
real
basis
of
the
justification
for
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
has
this
court
has
previously
said
it.
in
1967
when
this
court,
i
think
last
considered
judicial
immunity
in
pierson
v
ray.
it
indicated
that
they
realized
that
immunity
was
unnecessary
fact
for
a
judge
in
order
to
be
able
to
act.
but,
this
court
also
recognized
in
bradley
and
in
randall
that
there
is
a
counter
balance
inherent
within
the
judicial
system
that
protects
the
litigant,
and
that
is
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
your
honor,
in
that
instance
there
are
specific
rules
and
specific
statutes
authorizing
the
judge
to
approve
of
a
minor's
settlement
in
that
type
of
instance
whereas
in
our
case
there
was
no
statute
authorizing.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
in
the
instance
of
your
example,
i
think
there
was
a
case
presented
to
the
judge.
although,
in
manner
outside
of
the
filing,
perhaps
something
was
filed
in
this
court.
i
am
sure
he
spoke
through
the
court's
record
when
he
approved
of
the
settlement.
at
least
in
our
state
the
court
would
have
spoken
through
its
records
at
that
point.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
in
the
instance
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
have
only
handled
one
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
in
the
state
of
the
indiana,
i
have
only
handled
one
and
i
did
file
it
in
the
circuit
court,
i
titled
it
ray,
the
settlement
of
minor
child
so
and
so.
it
was
filed
in
court
and
the
court
on
a
docket
sheet
made
a
record.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
my
feeling
is
that
probably
he
needs.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
i
think
the
law
is
that
the
decisions
to
date,
i
had
said
that
it
must
be
judicial
act.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
that
the
law
in
state
of
indiana
is
that
a
parent
may
consent
to
necessary
surgery
of
a
minor.
but,
mr.
justice
marshall
i
would
submit
that
this
was
not
the
type
of
necessary
surgery.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
that
a.l.
vs
g.r.h.
which
was
decided
in
1975
by
the
indiana
court
of
appeals,
said
en
banc
says
that
that
statute
does
not
give
a
parent
the
consent
that
the
authority
to
consent
to
a
sterilization
on
a
minor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
the
general
statute
is
still
true.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
tonsillectomy,
i
would
have
no
question
that
a
parent
could
consent
to
a
tonsillectomy
of
a
minor
child
because
that
is
necessary.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
is
right,
in
need
not
go
to
a
court
and
that
is
why
getting
back.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
your
honor
no
one.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
do
not
know,
i
would
assume
that
he
assumed
that
he
had
authority
to
do
it.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
but,
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
in
a
non-judicial.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
not
only
that
he
did
not
file
it.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
he
did
not
appoint
the
guardian
ad
litem
to
represent
like
that.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
he
did
not
make
a
record
of
his
approval.
that
he
did
not
let
his
approval
be
known
to
linda
so
that
she
could
appeal
the
act
and
appeal
the
approval
and
prevent
the
act
of
permanent
sterilization
from
being
performed.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
your
honor,
in
indiana
trial
rule
17,
the
indiana
trial
rules
state
that
the
guardian
ad
litem
that
a
natural
parent
in
effect,
if
she
is
the
guardian
ad
litem,
this
is
in
extrapolation
of
what
the
statute
says,
if
the
interest
of
the
guardian
ad
litem
would
be
contrary
then
the
court
must
appoint
a
new
guardian
ad
litem
to
represent.
now,
clearly
when
a
mother
on
extremely
untutored
to
say
the
least
allegations
that
her
child
is
maybe
somewhat
retarded
although,
progressing
normally
through
her
school,
when
she
turns
to
a
court
and
makes
these
types
of
allegations,
clearly,
she
is
no
longer
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
her
child.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
cannot
believe
that
it
was
a
judicial
error
when
he
did
nothing
that
a
judge
does.
it
was
an
error
in
a
administrative
capacity
perhaps
because
i
think
if
the
judge
knew
of
this
statute,
the
consent
statute
and
he
thought
that
he
was
following
the
consent
statute
dicta
or
demand,
then
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
anything
and
his
signature
on
that
piece
of
paper
was
a
nullity.
there
was
no
reason
for
it
to
leave,
if
it
had
even
been
there.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
as
a
result,
of
the
judge's
actions?
mr.
richard
h.
finley
because
the
judge
i
think
conspired
and
our
allegations
are
such
in
the
complaint,
he
conspired
with
these
others
to
hide
the
fact
from
linda.
i
think
that
a
judge
sitting
on
a
bench
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
well,
factually
it
is
not
in
the
record
because
we
have
never
had
a
trial
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
we
could
show
if
there
were
a
trial
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
appreciate
the
determining
what
is
necessary
surgery
is
sometimes
difficult.
again,
i
would
go
back
probably
to
the
discussions
of
the
kidney
transplant
cases,
is
it
necessary
to
have
a
kidney
transplant
let's
say
from
identical
twins
when
the
doctors
might
testify
that
the
twins
who
does
not
receive
the
transplant
will
die.
but,
the
twin
who
is
asked
to
give
up
a
kidney
to
save
his
twin
brother
is
not
benefited.
courts
have
and
i
frankly
do
not
agree
with
the
decisions
in
all
but
one
instance
that
i
been
able
to
find,
courts
have
said
that
that
is
not
necessary
surgery.
so,
i
think
that
the
court
can
look
factually
maybe
through
psychiatrist's
testimony
as
to
what
the
cosmetic
surgery
might
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
who
needs
it
or
on
whom
it
is
ought
to
be
performed.
perhaps
psychiatrist
could
testify
as
to
beneficial
nature
to
that
child.
but,
i
think
in
the
example,
the
instant
case
clearly
anybody
can
see
that
sterilization
is
not
beneficial
or
therapeutic
or
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
linda
sparkman
from
having
children,
there
could
been
other
things
done.
if
in
fact,
that
were
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
if
one
were
to
take
the
analysis
of
the
petitioners
that
the
consent
statute
authorized
the
mother
to
consent
to
the
sterilization
of
her
child
then
arguably
it
could
be
said
that
the
judge
never
even
been
had
to
be
petitioned.
but,
there
is
the
other
side
to
that
story
again
under
trial
rule
17,
once
it
was
submitted
to
the
judge,
he
as
a
judge
i
would
assume
would
owe
a
duty
to
then
proceed
to
protect
the
rights
of
linda
sparkman
whose
natural
guardian
clearly
was
requesting
something
contrary
to
her
rights.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
think
so.
but,
i
think
he
completely
evaded
it
and
did
not
treat
it
in
any
sense.
witness
of
fact
that
he
did
nothing
to
protect
linda,
he
did
what
he
did
in
total
secrecy.
it
can
be
shown,
and
will
be
shown
factually
if
we
ever
get
to
that
point
that
he
had
lots
of
opportunities
to
tell
linda
sparkman
that
she
was
sterilized
but
he
never
took
those
opportunities.
if
i
may
just
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
i
think
at
that
point
it
is
much
too
late.
but,
all
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
maybe
you
can
infer
from
the
opportunities
at
the
end
what
his
real
intent
was,
that
was
evading
the
judicial
act
nature
of
it
from
the
beginning.
a
judge
owes
a
duty
to
protect
the
people
brought
in
front
of
him,
just
as
much
he
owes
a
duty
to
penalize
the
people
brought
in
front
of
him.
but,
getting
back
to
the
rationale.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
if
they
were,
that
piece
of
paper
said
linda
sparkman
on
it
and
he
must
read
before
he
signed
it.
if
he
had
been
acting
to
the
judge
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
do
not
think
it
would
been
a
judicial
act
and
i
know
it
would
have
been
clearly
outside
of
any
jurisdiction
he
might
had
have.
the
indiana
law
did
not
permit,
getting
back
to
the
consent
and
i
think
this
is
important
and
i
not
mentioned
it
to
date
and
petitioners
have
not.
there
were
statutes
on
the
books
in
indiana
in
1971
authorizing
sterilization
of
institutionalized
individuals.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
saying
and
through
statutory
construction,
and
the
seventh
circuit
so
held
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
is
common
statutory
construction
at
all
that
through
the
expressed
permission
of
sterilization
of
certain
of
its
citizens,
indiana
is
saying
you
cannot
sterilize
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
in
1971,
the
only
way
that
this
child
could
have
been
sterilized,
is
if
she
were
an
institutionalized
mentally
retarded
child
and
if
the
procedures
were
specific
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
in
that
instance
i
would
go
around
the
statute,
no
matter
what
it
might
say
and
if
i
were
the
judge,
in
ordering
the
sterilization.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
judge
ashba
(ph),
i
recognize,
felt
that
also
--
what
you
are
saying
that
in
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
in
1975,
a.l
versus
g.r.h.
was
decided
and
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
your
honor
the
other
statutes
were
removed
from
the
books
by
that
time.
they
were
no
longer
on
the
books.
let
me
say
getting
back
to
judge
ashba,
he
also
said,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
consent
statute
referred
to
here
did
not
authorize
the
parent
to
consent
to
it.
it
said
it
was
derogative
of
common
law.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
is
what
judge
ashpa
said.
but,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
correct
analysis
of
the
prior
supreme
court
decisions
which
preserve
the
right
to
a
litigant
to
appeal
and
the
manner
in
which
the
sterilization
was
approved
by
judge
stump,
totally
destroyed
and
intentionally
destroyed
any
right
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
so,
there
are
other
ways
in
which
it
could
be
decided
and
42
usc
1988,
which
says
that
state
law
should
be
applied
rather
than
federal
law
and
immunity
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
state
law
in
indiana
of
immunity
is
that
a
court
before
he
has
jurisdiction
must
have
a
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction.
again,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
fact
instance,
in
the
instant
case
that
the
judge
had
no
personal
jurisdiction
even
though
he
might,
i
would
not
concede
it
but,
he
might
argumentatively
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
i
think
that
as
i
understand
it,
the
federal
law
is
that
lynch
vs
johnson,
monroe
versus
pepe,
all
say
that
federal
law
applies
generally
speaking
but
if
the
state
law
is
more
protective
of
the
rights
of
the
individual,
then
i
think
it
is
questionable
under
1988
if
perhaps
the
state
law
is
not
the
law
of
judicial
immunity
which
is
to
be
applied.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
guardian
ad
litem
was
the
one
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
questions
--
judge
stump
had
a
case
and
had
appointed
a
guardian.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
if
he
had
assumed
it
in
a
judicial
manner,
ultimately
he
would
have
gone
far
enough
down
the
road
to
have
had
jurisdiction
to
appoint.
in
fact
not
only
jurisdiction,
the
responsibility
to
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem.
but,
he
avoided
all
of
this.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
because
i
do
not
think
he
got
far
enough
down
the
road.
mr.
chief
justice,
he
did
nothing
from
very
the
beginning
in
order
to
assume
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
think
that
a
court.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
he
did
not
sign
your
honor
an
order.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
that
is
right.
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
but,
to
logically
follow,
if
understand
what
where
you
getting
now,
to
logically
follow
that
would
be
to
say,
that
any
judge
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
can
do
through
an
approval.
not
a
court
order
or
call
it
court
order
if
you
want
can
do
absolutely
anything
without
denying
himself
immunity.
he
need
not
open
a
case,
he
need
not
file
stamp
anything,
he
need
not
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem,
he
can
do
it
in
secrecy
and
he
can
do
with
intent
to
deprive
the
person
who’s
rights
he
is
considering
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
that
trial
rule
17
required
him
to
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem,
if
he
had
a
case
in
front
of
him
that
showed
a
litigant's
rights
were
being
challenged.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
think
a.l.
v
g.r.h.
clearly
it
did
not
address
itself
to
that
question
because
it
met
it
in
the
proper
manner
to
begin
with.
it
did
appoint
a
guardian
ad
litem
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
child
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
only
way
a
court
can
properly
act.
otherwise,
i
can
imagine
no
instance,
no
matter
how
gross
you
want
to
make
it.
the
amputation
of
one’s
head
is
not
within
the
arguable
general
jurisdiction
of
court
or
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
would
say
that
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
case,
look
at
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
questioning,
look
at
the
reasons
behind
the
request,
determine
if
under
the
indiana
statute
of
a
parent
having
the
power
to
consent
a
necessary
surgery
to
look
at
it
and
look
closely
and
if
he
made
an
err,
he
is
still
entitled
to
immunity.
there
is
no
question
because
he
is
done
something
that
a
judge
does
after
he
is
assumed
jurisdiction
in
a
judge
like
manner.
but,
comparing
it
again
with
the
fact
situation
we
have
got
that
analogy
does
not
even
come
close
--
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor
they
do.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
he
has
to
act
as
a
judge
in
order
to
protect
--.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
mr.
fruechtenicht
began
at
the
very
beginning
explaining
that
judge
stump
is
an
experienced
judge.
he
had
been
there
a
heck
of
a
long
time
and
he
had
been.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
your
honor,
if
this
were
a
simple
mistake
after
he
had
assumed
jurisdiction
or
if
there
had
been
arguably
subject
matter
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
do
not
think
he
thought
he
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
know
judge
stump
fairly
well
and
i
doubt
very
seriously
if
he
thought
he
had
jurisdiction.
i
think
he
probably
thought
that
this
girl
should
be
sterilized.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
he
did
not
type
that.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
assume
he
read
it
also.
and
i
assume
that
when
he
read
it,
he
saw
that
the
right
appropriate
and
this
girl
one
of
our
basic
constitutional
rights
was
being
taken
away,
and
he
as
a
judge
knew
that
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
the
indiana
required
him
to
do
lots
of
things,
if
he
was
going
to
act
as
a
judge
and
he
did
not
owe
one
of
those
things
that
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
indiana
requiring
to
do.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
yes,
your
honor
i
would.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
your
honor,
as
a
predicate
to
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
this
court
has
always
stated,
as
it
was
stated
in
england
in
the
1600,
it
must
be
a
judicial
act
taken
within
the
judge's
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
i
also
say
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction,
i
agree
with
this
seventh
circuit
analysis.
mr.
richard
h.
finley
no
immunity,
that
would
be
waived
for
(inaudible)
and
clearly
it
is
in
violation
of
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
most
liberally
defined
and
no
immunity.
but,
here
that
question
need
not
be
reached,
if
it
were
reached,
i
would
still
say
that
all
three
of
the
supreme
court
cases,
previously
decided
would
deny
immunity.
if
not,
then
as
i
said
earlier,
any
judge
of
general
jurisdiction
can
do
anything
and
that
cannot
be
justified
with
the
previous
rational
granting
immunity
and
if
i
may
say
one
further
thing.
the
last
case
that
this
court
really
decided,
i
think
in
giving
blank
immunity
to
prosecutors
in
imbler
v.
patchman,
is
not
contrary
to
what
i
am
saying,
because
again
the
court
was
very
careful
in
pointing
out
that
what
that
judge
or
prosecutor
did
was
within
his
prosecutorial
function
and
what
judge
stump
did
was
in
no
way
within
his
judicial
functioning.
he
completely
over
look
and
intentionally
so
his
judicial
functions.
thank
you.
