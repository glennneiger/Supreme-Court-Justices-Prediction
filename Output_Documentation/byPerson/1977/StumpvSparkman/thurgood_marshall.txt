justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
how
many
of
these
do
we
have
in
the
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
cases
do
we
have
we
in
the
country,
where
a
mother
has
for
a
daughter
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
an
action
at
law
or
an
equity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
did
he
choose
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
does
that
include
admiralty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
streams
that
are
navigable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
streams
that
are
navigable.
stream,
would
you
mean,
a
river.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
they
have
jurisdiction
over
bankruptcy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
and
i
both
know
that
when
use
a
general
term,
you
do
not
mean
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
entertain
a
petition
of
the
man
to
have
mrs.
john
dow
sterilized.
mrs.
john
dow
being
no
relation
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
petition
was
filed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
john
jones,
to
have
mary
brown
sterilized.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
reason
given
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
she
on
her
own
have
the
child
sterilized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
she
got
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
statute
do
you
have
in
indiana
that
authorized
the
parent
to
sterilized
the
child,
without
the
child's
permission.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
get
through
your
suggestion
would
you
give
me
the
case
that
the
judge
cited?
he
did
not
cite
a
piece
of
law
about
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
where
is
his
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
supreme
court
in
your
state
have
the
same
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
minor
is
also
represented
by
counsel,
two
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
not
have
a
committed
appointed
for
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
he
be
present
if
he
is
a
minor
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
statute
that
provides
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
take
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
brother
says
that
he
read
neatly.
there
might
be
some
more,
i
mean
for
example
that
child
might
have
done
nothing
in
the
world
at
all,
is
that
not
a
possibility?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
a
possibility
so
far
as
the
record
in
the
case
is
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
case
where
it
had
not
reached
the
court
yet
and
the
settlement
is
made,
is
that
filed
in
the
court
because
when
they
say
it
is
filed,
under
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
those
are
not
filed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
brings
me
to
the
other
point,
what
about
the
petition
is
pointed,
it
did
not
need
to
sign
this
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
do
better
than
your
feeling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
not
the
law
that
an
operation
of
the
minor
is
controlled
by
the
parent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
statute
or
case
in
what
nobody
is
saying
that
is
a
statute
or
case,
that
says,
“yes,
you
know
on
this
point.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
general
one
is
still
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
tonsillectomy
for
example.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
in
this
case
assumes
that
what
is
his
doing
is
just
perfunctory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
assumed
that
he
has
authority
to
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
he
did.
i
am
not
drawing
any
meaning,
whatever
i
say,
i
thought
the
judge
thought
he
was
doing
is
just
what
is
right.
and
i
still
do
not
know
that
it
was
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
the
plaintiff,
he
did
not
file
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay,
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
it
did
in
other
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
was
your
client
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
too
sure
if
you
have
no
any
right
to
charge
him
a
conspiracy
at
all.
you
do
not
know
whether
he
saw
anybody.
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
that
in
conspiracy
you
can
not
have
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
we
not
decide
this
case
without
using
words
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
that
(inaudible)
or
whatever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
not
think,
he
was
doing
judge's
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
judge
in
a
rare
community
is
it
right?
and
is
it
not
true
in
most
rare
communities,
i
do
not
know
about
indiana.
by
billing
quite
a
few,
that
people
just
drop
in
at
the
street
and
check
with
the
judge.
is
that
not
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
order
to
for
him
to
lose
his
immunity,
does
he
have
to
say,
“i
am
acting
as
a
judge
or
not
acting
as
a
judge.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
is
that
not
in
his
mind
that?
it
is
he,
that
is
the
one
the
seeking
immunity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
many
of
experienced
judges
who
have
made
mistakes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
not
think
he
assumed
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know
one
where
the
other
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
sign
and
said
that
he
was
a
judge,
did
he
not
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
he
signed
and
i
assume
he
read
it.
and
nothing
you
will
say
contradicts
my
assumption
that
he
read
it.
