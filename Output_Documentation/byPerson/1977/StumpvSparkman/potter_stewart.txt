justice
potter
stewart
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
joined.
it
is
established
federal
law
that
judges
of
general
jurisdiction
are
absolutely
immune
from
monetary
liability,
for
judicial
acts
even
when
such
acts
are
in
excess
of
their
jurisdiction.
but
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity
is
limited
to
liability
for
judicial
acts
and
i
think
that
what
judge
stump
did
on
july
9,
1971
approving
an
operation
permanently
sterilizing
this
unknowing
young
woman
was
beyond
the
pale
of
anything
that
could
sensibly
be
called
a
judicial
act.
the
court
finds
two
reasons
for
holding
the
judge
stump's
approval
of
the
sterilization
petition
was
a
judicial
act.
first,
the
court
says,
it
was
a
function
normally
performed
by
a
judge.
second,
the
court
says
the
act
was
performed
in
judge
stump's
judicial
capacity.
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
the
first
of
these
grounds
is
factually
untrue
and
that
the
second
is
legally
unsound.
in
indiana
as
elsewhere
in
our
country,
a
parent
is
authorized
to
arrange
for
in
consent
to
medical
and
surgical
treatment
of
her
minor
child.
and
when
a
parent
decides
to
call
a
physician
to
care
for
her
sick
child
or
arranges
to
have
a
surgeon
remove
her
child's
tonsils
she
does
not
normally
or
otherwise
need
to
seek
the
approval
of
a
judge.
on
the
other
hand,
indiana
did
in
1971,
have
statutory
procedures
for
the
sterilization
of
certain
people
who
were
confined
in
institutions
but
these
statutes
provided
for
administrative
proceedings
before
a
board
established
by
the
superintendent
of
each
public
hospital.
in
sum,
what
judge
stump
did
on
july
9,
1971
was
in
no
way
an
act
normally
performed
by
a
judge.
indeed
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
such
an
act
has
ever
been
performed
by
any
other
indiana
judge
either
before
or
since.
when
the
court
says
that
judge
stump
was
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity
in
approving
mrs.
mcfarlin's
petition,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
the
court
means
that
mrs.
mcfarlin
submitted
the
petition
to
him
only
because
he
was
a
judge
or
that
in
approving
it,
he
said
he
was
acting
as
judge.
but
however,
the
court's
test
is
to
be
understood,
it
is
i
think
the
demonstrably
unsound.
it
can
safely
be
assumed
that
mrs.
mcfarlin
came
to
judge
stump
with
her
petition
because
he
was
a
county
circuit
court
judge.
but
false
illusions
as
to
a
judge's
power
can
hardly
convert
a
judge's
response
to
those
illusions
into
a
judicial
act.
a
judges
approval
of
a
mother's
petition
to
lock
her
daughter
in
the
attic
would
hardly
be
a
judicial
act
simply
because
the
mother
had
submitted
her
petition
to
the
judge
in
his
official
capacity.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
test
depends
upon
the
fact
that
judge
stump
said
he
was
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity
is
equally
invalid.
it
is
true
that
judge
stump
affixed
his
signature
to
the
approval
of
the
petition
as
“judge
dekalb
circuit
court”
but
the
conduct
of
a
judge
surely
does
not
become
a
judicial
act
merely
on
his
own
say
so.
a
judge
is
not
free
like
a
lose
cannon
to
inflict
indiscriminate
damage
whenever
he
announces
that
he
is
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity.
my
conclusion
that
what
judge
stump
did
was
not
a
judicial
act
is
not
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
acted
within
formality
or
that
he
may
not
have
been
in
his
judge's
robes,
or
in
the
courtroom
itself.
it
seems
to
me,
rather,
that
the
concept
of
what
is
a
judicial
act
must
take
its
content
from
a
consideration
of
the
factors
that
support
immunity
from
liability
for
the
performance
of
such
an
act.
those
factors
were
accurately
summarized
by
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
warren
more
than
ten
years
ago
in
a
case
called
pierson
v.
ray,
reported
in
volume
386
of
the
unites
states
reports.
and
i
quote,
"it
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
whose
interest
it
is
that
the
judges
should
be
at
liberty
to
exercise
their
functions
with
independence
and
without
fear
of
consequences.
it
is
a
judge's
duty
to
decide
all
cases
within
his
jurisdiction
that
are
brought
before
him,
including
controversial
cases
that
arouse
the
most
intense
feelings
in
the
litigants.
his
errors
maybe
corrected
on
appeal,
but
he
should
not
have
to
fear
that
unsatisfied
litigants
may
hound
him
with
litigation
charging
malice
or
corruption.
imposing
such
a
burden
on
judges
would
contribute
not
to
principled
and
fearless
decision-making
but
to
intimidation.
"not
one
of
the
considerations
thus
summarized
in
the
pierson
opinion
was
present
here.
there
was
no
case,
controversial
or
otherwise.
there
were
no
litigants.
there
was
and
there
could
be
no
appeal.
and
it
was
not
even
the
pretext
of
principled
decision
making.
the
total
absence
of
any
of
these
normal
attributes
of
a
judicial
proceeding
convinces
me
that
the
conduct
complained
of
in
this
case
was
not
a
judicial
act.
the
petitioners'
brief
speaks
of
an
aura
of
deism
which
surrounds
the
bench
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
respect
for
the
judicial
institution.
if
aura
there
be,
it
is
hardly
protected
by
exonerating
from
liability
such
lawless
conduct
as
took
place
here.
and
if
intimidation
would
serve
to
deter
its
recurrence,
that
would
surely
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
for
these
reasons
discussed
in
more
detail
in
a
written
dissenting
opinion
filed
today
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
disagree
with
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
further
amplification
of
his
views.
