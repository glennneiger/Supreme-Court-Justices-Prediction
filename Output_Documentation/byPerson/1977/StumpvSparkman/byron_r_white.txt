justice
byron
r.
white
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
united
states
code
authorizes
suits
by
plaintiffs
who
claim
that
state
officials
have
invaded
their
constitutional
rights.
historically
however,
english
and
unites
states
judges
have
not
been
subject
to
suits
for
damages
for
judicial
acts
within
their
jurisdiction.
and
our
cases
have
established
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
do
away
with
this
immunity
when
section
1983
was
enacted.
this
case
which
involves
the
question
of
judicial
immunity
under
this
under
this
doctrine
arose
when
a
mother
determined
that
her
minor
daughter
should
be
sterilized
and
presented
to
a
state
court
judge,
a
petition
for
an
order
authorizing
such
an
operation.
the
petition
was
drawn
by
the
mother's
attorney
and
was
presented
to
the
judge
who
then
approved
it
over
his
judicial
signature.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
daughter
and
no
guardian
ad
litem
was
appointed.
the
operation
was
then
performed,
the
daughter
not
then
being
informed
of
the
real
nature
of
this
surgery.
when
she
later
married
and
learned
the
condition,
she
brought
suit
to
the
united
states
district
court
against
all
those
responsible
including
the
judge.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case,
holding
that
the
judge
who
presided
over
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
had
the
authority
under
state
law
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
petition
and
that
whether
or
not
he
was
in
error
in
approving
it,
he
was
immune
under
established
immunity
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
re-granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
by
the
judge.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
petition
presented
to
the
judge
was
within
the
jurisdiction
under
the
applicable
state
law
and
that
he
is
not
liable
for
damages
under
section
1983,
even
if
he
was
mistaken
in
his
construction
of
the
state
law,
his
act
of
approving
the
petition.
the
respondent
also
claims
that
no
immunity
should
attach
here
because
the
act
of
signing
the
authorization
order
was
not
a
judicial
act
and
that
it
was
performed
so
informally
and
was
so
lacking
in
procedural
safeguards
that
the
approval
of
ex
parte
orders
with
respect
to
minors
at
the
behest
of
their
natural
guardians
is
not
unusual
and
here
the
mother
came
to
the
judge
as
a
judge
and
he
purported
to
act
as
one,
when
he
approved
the
petition
and
signed
the
authorization
order
as
he
had
the
jurisdiction
to
do
under
state
law,
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
accordingly
reversed.
dissents
will
be
announced
but
i
should
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
