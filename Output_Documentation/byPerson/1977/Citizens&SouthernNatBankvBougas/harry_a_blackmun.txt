justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
georgia.
the
issue
is
as
to
the
proper
venue
in
a
state
court
of
a
transitory
cause
of
action
against
a
national
bank.
the
resolution
of
the
case
depends
on
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute
formerly
section
94
of
title
12
of
the
united
states
code.
this
statute
resides
an
action
against
a
national
bank
in
federal
court,
may
be
had
where
the
bank
is
established,
but
when
it
is
the
state
court
it
may
be
held
where
the
bank
is
located.
the
petitioners
citizens
and
southern
is
a
national
bank.
it's
home
office
is
in
savannah,
georgia,
but
it
has
branches
in
other
places
in
the
state
of
georgia.
this
action
was
brought
against
decould
county,
i
think
they
call
it
dekalb
county
down
there,
near
atlanta.
the
bank
moved
a
dismissal
suit
on
grounds
of
improper
venue.
the
county
court
denied
that
motion
and
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
venue
for
a
suit
against
a
national
bank
brought
in
a
state
court
need
not
be
in
the
county
where
the
bank's
charter
was
issued,
in
this
case
in
chatham
county
where
savannah
is
located,
but
may
it
be
in
a
county
in
which
the
bank
conducts
its
business
at
an
authorized
branch.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
georgia
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined
the
opinion
but
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
statement.
