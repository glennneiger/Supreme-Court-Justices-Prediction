mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
mr.
chief
justiceand
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
humphreys
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
citizens
&
southern
national
bank.
the
case
arises
out
of
title
12,
section
94
of
the
united
states
code
which
is
known
as
the
national
bank
venue
act
and
the
case
involves
the
application
and
interpretation
of
that
bank
venue
provision.
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
requires
this
court
to
decide
whether
the
statute
requires
that
a
national
bank
only
be
sued
in
its
home
county,
that
is,
the
county
which
is
specified
in
its
certificate
of
organization.
a
second
issue
that
must
be
decided
by
the
court
in
order
for
any
decision
on
the
merits
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
be
rendered
meaningful
is
whether
a
national
bank
may
waive
the
provisions
of
section
94
by
the
establishment
of
a
branch
bank
in
a
county
other
than
a
county
where
it
is
chartered.
those
are
the
two
issues
presented
by
this
petition
to
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
that
fact
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
will
frankly
concede
that
cns
has
branches
in
many
counties
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yes
sir
and
that
is
not
disputed
and
in
fact,
in
the
instant
case
the
record
shows
that
we
did
have
a
branch
in
the
dekalb
county
where
this
suit
was
brought,
that
is
not
our
home
office.
our
home
office
specified
in
the
certificate
of
organization
is
in
chatham
county,
georgia.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
the
venue
was
waived
by
the
bank
in
that
particular
case
raised,
then
it
would
be
required
to
be
sued
in
savannah,
its
home
county.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yes,
it
is
the
county
specified
in
its
charter,
is
the
word
we
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yes
it
is
a
little
bit
different
with
regard
to
national
banks,
they
are
obviously
federally
chartered
and
there
is
not
the
registration
that
goes
over
state
corporations
rather
there
is
a
certificate
of
organization
and
in
that
certificate
of
organization
there
is
a
place
specified
and
it
is
that
place
that
we
contend
is
the
home
county,
that
is,
the
place
specified
in
the
certificate
of
organization.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
well,
at
the
time
the
bank
is
initially
chartered
then
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
when
they
are
chartered
they
will
select
a
place
that
is
to
be
their
home
office
and
then
there
are
really
strict
provisions
that
that
home
office,
for
example,
cannot
be
moved
during
the
lifetime
of
the
bank
over
fifty
miles.
so
that
even
if,
as
i
understand
it,
if
you
select
county
a,
then
you
cannot
move
that
county,
your
principal
office
over
fifty
miles.
you
can
move
it
fifty
miles
with
the
permission
of
the
controller
of
the
currency
but
as
i
read,
i
believe
it
is
12
of
united
states
code
section
30,
you
may
not
move
it
over
fifty
miles.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
are
approximately,
when
i
went
through
and
counted,
at
least
seven
or
eight
statutes
that
talk
about
activities
and
duties
that
must
be
conducted
where
you
are
located.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
specific
statute
in
existence
now
that
requires
that
the
records
be
maintained
only
at
that
one
office.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor
there
may
be
i
am
--
there
may
be
a
regulation
such
as
that,
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
know
of
any,
i
do
not
find
any
specific
statutory
authority,
there
may
be
certain
records
but
generally
the
bank
can
of
course,
now
conduct
business
not
only
in
its
main
office
but
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
well,
for
example,
one
very
important
statute,
i
believe
governs
the
amount
of
reserves
that
must
be
maintained
with
federal
reserve
bank
and
this
statute
requires
that
if
you
are
located
in
a
federal
reserve
city
that
you
will
maintain
so
many
percentage
of
reserves,
if
you
are
not
located
in
a
reserve
city,
the
reserve
requirements
are
less,
this
we
found
in
12
united
states,
code
142.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no
your
honor,
the
reason
we
are
in
savannah
is
because
years
ago,
we
in
fact
were
started
in
savannah.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
again
that
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
am
certain
that
we
have.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
would
presume
so
as
long
as
they
were
part
of
the
same
bank.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
am
reluctant,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
will
add
that
with
regard
to
the
requirement
that
it
be
moved
fifty
mile
that
it
only
be
moved
fifty
miles.
and
even
then
only
with
the
controller's
permission,
i
am
told
as
an
anecdote
that
at
one
point
in
time
there
was
thought
of
trying
to
move
the
office
from
chatham
county
to
atlanta
and
someone
suggested
they
could
only
do
it
at
about
50
miles
a
week,
so
that
they
would
move
fifty
miles
one
week
and
fifty
miles
the
next,
but
clearly
i
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
know
whether
if
they
could
discontinue
banking
activities,
i
believe
this
will
probably
depend
to
some
extent
on
the
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice's
argument
which
i
am
not
able
to
answer
and
that
is
must
there
be
some
records,
must
there
be
a
physical
place
that
continues
to
be
maintained
in
the
home
county
and
that
there
may
be
some
regulations
regarding
that.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
opened
up
branching
somewhat
and
i
believe
it
is
now
a
grandfather
situation,
we
can
pretty
much
go,
we
can
merge
with
and
i
believe
this
court
considered
the
effects
of
that,
what
used
to
be
5%
banks
and
i
believe
now
we
have
state
wide
branch
banking
in
georgia,
it
is
not
grandfather
situation.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
oh!
yes
your
honor.
we
did
have
that
large
such
at
one
time
and
it
has
got
the
georgia
banking
law
has
gone
through
several
phases
and
i
am
confident
that
that
law
did
exist
at
one
pint
because
that
is
why
the
we
used
to
have
grandfather
or
5%
banks
where
the
bank
would
go
and
could
only
own
5%
of
banks
in
other
county.
so
we
did
have
that
at
one
point
in
time.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
do
not
know
how
many
counties,
i
am
sorry,
that
georgia
has
but
it
is
a
large
number
of
counties
and
the
bank
will
undoubtedly
have
branches
in
those
counties
where
it
is
profitable
to
open
up
an
office
or
have
a
branch.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
involves
basically
the
meaning
of
two
words
in
12
u.s.c
section
94.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no
your
honor
,
this
statute
was
being
presented
to
be
written
by
congress
today.
there
was
probably
no
policy
argument
for
not
writing
a
statute
that
will
allow
a
branch
of
bank
to
be
sued
at
any
place,
it
had
a
branch,
for
calls
of
action
arising
out
of
the
business
activities
conducted
in
that
branch.
i
do
not
believe
there
would
probably
be
a
very
good
policy
argument
for
not
giving
the
bank
the
same
wide
venue
that
a
corporation
has.
12
u.s.c.
94
contains
two
basic
provisions,
one
is
a
federal
provision
and
a
one
is
a
state
provision.
the
federal
provision
says
simply
that
a
bank
may
be
sued
in
any
county
or
in
any
federal
court,
in
any
district
in
which
the
bank
is
established;
and
the
state
court
provision
provides
that
a
bank
in
for
state
court
purposes
may
be
sued
in
any
state
municipal
county
court
in
the
county
in
which
it
is
located
and
these
two
provisions
were
enacted,
one
in
1863,
the
federal
court
provision,
and
one
in
1864,
the
state
court
provision.
now,
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
decided
that
since
congress
had
used
a
different
word
'located'
in
describing
the
venue
for
national
banks
then
it
did
when
it
described
the
venue
for
national
banks
which
was
connected
to
the
word
established
and
that
therefore
a
congress
must
have
intended
for
located
to
have
different
meaning,
a
broader
meaning
than
the
word
'established'
and
therefore
congress
must
have
intended
for
banks
to
be
sued
in
every
county
in
which
they
were
located.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
were
not
any
branch
banks
in
1864.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
arguing
for
that.
i
believe
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
as
in
other
courts,
state
courts
are
trying
to
find
ways
to
expand
their
venue.
that
has
always
been
the
case
and
they
looked
at
the
dictionary
not
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
but
the
security
mills
vs.
wachovia
case
in
north
carolina
took
a
run
through
the
dictionary
to
look
at
the
various
words
and
definitions
of
'locate'
and
'establish'.
this
is
not
a
very
fruitful
task
because
one
of
the
synonymous
meanings
or
synonyms
for
locate
is
to
establish.
so
having
done
that
to
still
give
them
opposite
meanings
does
not
make
a
lot
of
sense
and
that's
particularly
true
in
light
of
the
conditions
that
existed
in
1863,
as
we
have
said
there
were
not
branch
banks
in
1863,
a
bank
could
only
do
business
in
one
place,
the
county
in
which
its
certificate
of
organization
was
issued.
but
more
importantly
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
in
federal
courts
in
1863
and
1864
was
concurrent
with
regard
to
national
banks
and
this
to
me
is
very
important
in
deciding
whether
located
and
established
mean
the
same
thing,
because
until
1882,
any
suit
against
the
national
bank
could
be
brought
in
the
first
instance
in
federal
court
without
regard
to
diversity
and
without
regard
to
amount
involved.
similarly,
any
suit
brought
in
state
court
could
also
be
removed
to
a
federal
court
since
the
federal
courts
had
concurrent
and
original
jurisdiction
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
becomes
even
more
untenable
that
a
federal
court,
that
congress
intended
for
state
courts
to
have
a
broader
venue
and
to
permit
suits
in
more
state
courts
than
in
federal
courts
with
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
the
same
really
holds
true
today,
because
if
a
diversity
suit
were
brought
in
georgia
in
a
branch,
in
a
place
other
than
where
the
bank
was
established,
the
bank
could
remove
that
case
to
federal
court,
and
the
federal
courts
are
clearly
unanimous
in
holding
that
the
word
established
refers
only
to
the
place
specified
in
the
bank's
certificate
of
organization.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
be
a
diversity
case,
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be
a
new
york
citizens
suing
a
bank
in
georgia
and,
for
example,
bringing
suit
in
atlanta.
that
would
not
work
with
two
georgia
citizens
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
since
1882,
now
prior
to
1882,
you
have
the
same
result,
you
would
remove
and
then
you
could
end
up
back
in
the
county
where
you
started
or
rather
have
the
case
dismissed,
if
you
are
moving
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
so
i
submit
that
the
first
argument
or
consideration
that
should
not
control
in
this
case
is
any
consideration
that
the
word
located
and
established
had
different
meanings
as
used
by
congress
in
1863
and
1864.
whatever,
interpretation
is
given
to
the
word
located
in
this
case
and
this
is
clearly
a
state
court
case.
it
is
not,
does
not
arise
in
the
federal
court,
but
whatever
interpretation
this
court
gives
to
the
word
'located'
it
also
must
give
to
the
word
'established'
and
it
is
clear,
as
we
have,
i
think
mentioned
briefly
before
that
located
and
established
when
used
in
1863
and
1864
referred
only
to
one
place.
there
was
only
one
place
in
existence
at
1863
and
1864
and
that
was
the
place
that
the
bank
was
chartered.
now
further
more,
if
you
read
the
language
of
section
94
carefully
it
is
very
apparent
that
although
congress
might
have
mingled
the
words
located
and
established,
it
was
very
particular
as
to
when
it
intended
to
note
a
potential
plurality
and
when
it
intended
to
mean
the
singular
and
thus
the
statute
provides
that
the
suit
may
be
brought
in
any
district
or
territorial
court
of
the
united
states,
and
it
further
provides
that
the
suit
may
be
maintained
in
any
state,
county
or
municipal
court.
there
is
a
potential
plurality
of
courts
that
i
believe
could
be
found
from
that
language.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
was
quite
explicit
that
it
should
only
be
maintained
in
the
district,
the
one
district,
i
would
suggest
in
which
the
bank
was
established
and
in
the
one
city
or
county
in
which
the
bank
was
located.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
both
the
langdeau
case
helps
more
than
it
hurts
but
is
not
determinant
of
the
issue.
in
langdeau,
the
court
was
concerned
with
whether
12
usc
94
was
permissive
or
mandatory
that
was
the
only
issue
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
is
right,
whether
it
could
be
in
that
way
or
whether
it
had
to
be
applied
or
whether
it
just
was
something
that
could
be
applied.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
and
it
held
that
it
had
to
be
applied.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
there
was
no
question
there
about
where
the
bank
was
although
the
court
did
say
that
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
merely
permissive
rather
mandatory,
would
render
meaningless
a
congressional
enactment
permitting
suits
in
the
bank's
home
county.
now
that
is
an
exact
quote
from
mercantile,
they
coined
the
phrase
home
county,
the
court
in
mercantile.
this
court
really
for
a
hundred
and
three
years
beginning
back
in
1871
with
bank
of
bethel
in
going
really
down
through
1976
in
reds
and
harvard
case
has
never
intimated
and
it
has
many
opportunities
that
located
and
established
are
not
referred
to
any
place
other
the
one
place
that
is
the
place
in
the
certificate
of
organization.
for
40
years
the
federal
court,
ever
since
the
leonardi
case
which
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
1936,
for
40
years
the
federal
courts
have
been
unanimous
in
holding
that
established
is
determined
by
the
place
specified
in
the
bank's
certificate
of
organization
and
that
once
that
decision
is
made,
there
is
no
need
to
go
further
to
determine
where
venue
properly
lies
in
a
suit
against
the
bank.
most
courts,
most
even
state
courts
in
this
day
have
recognized
that
located
and
established
do
in
fact,
mean
not
only
the
same
thing
but
that
they
refer
only
to
the
county
specified
in
the
certificate
of
incorporation
or
rather
the
certificate
of
organization.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
made
diligent
search
to
try
to
find
out
this
potential
plurality
question
on
district
and
territorial
as
the
statute
was
initially
enacted
that
it
provided
that
it
could
be
brought
in
any
circuit
district
or
territorial
courts,
clearly,
i
believe
in
1863
there
still
were
circuit
courts
that
had
primary
or
trial
court
jurisdiction.
i
have
not
been
able
to
--
the
court
system
was
very
complicated
in
1863,
i
am
unable
to
say
that
there
was
a
state
that
had
a
district
or
a
territory.
i
do
know
that
back
in
1863
when
you
stick,
when
you
write
in
the
alternative
of
circuit
district
or
territorial
court,
i
feel
that
there
must
have
been
some
overlapping
and
even
if
we
can't,
i
can't
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
know
that
there
was
a
district
court,
i
know
there
were
district
courts
that
would
encompass
two
states,
i
know
that
and
over
the
district
might
cover
two
states
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
i
do
not
know
i
have
--
the
treatise
on
the
court
system
at
1863,
i
have
tried
to
go
through
and
it
is
a
very
tedious
task,
the
system
was
very
complicated
back
then
and
i
am
extremely
sorry,
your
honor,
i
simply
cannot
respond
to
that.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
not.
it
is
very
complicated,
i
will
go
back
and
undertake
that
but
we
have
tried
diligently
so
that
i
could
definitely
say
that
state
acts
had
a
district
and
the
circuit
court
in
it
and
therefore
there
was
a
reason
for
that
potential
plurality
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
my
ignorance
is
not
damming
to
my
argument
because
my
point
is
that
even
if
there
was
a
potential
plurality,
just
the
chance
of
more
than
one
congress
used
the
word
'any',
really
whether
there
were
more
than
one
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
if
there
was
a
chance
that
there
was
more
than
one
court
in
which
this
case
could
be
brought,
then
they
used
the
word
any.
in
other
words,
any
circuit
district
or
territorial
court
on
the
chance
that
there
was
a
plurality.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
there
are
still
states
today
that
have
only
one
district
court.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
the
act
probably
could
be
used
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
location
and
establishment
of
a
bank
versus
the
location
and
establishment
of
the
various
branches
of
that
bank
but
that
statute
has
no
effect
on
12
usc
94,
it
has
only
not
been
amended
by
congress,
the
federal
case
of
it
considered
that
the
mcfadden
act
had
placed
no
importance
on
it
to
the
extent
that
it
somehow
changes
or
effects
12
usc
94,
but
that
statute
was
written
at
the
time
still
in
terms
of
the
basis,
and
we
believe
of
the
county
specified
in
the
charter,
and
if
for
some
reason
located
and
established
are
now
supposed
to
mean
every
place
where
the
bank
has
a
branch
then
we
have
numerous
other
statutes,
for
example,
the
publication
of
controller's
report
shall
be
in
the
city
or
county
where
you
are
located.
these
reserve
requirements,
all
of
these
topple
like
house
of
cards
and
instead
of
having
one
central
county
where
all
of
these
reports
are
published
the
reserve
requirements
suits
against
the
controller
of
the
currency,
all
of
a
sudden
these
also
take
on
a
plurality
rather
than
what
we
contend
would
be
the
single
place,
where
congress
originally
intended
for
these
activities
to
take
place.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
it
many
have
all
of
the
attributes
of
the
bank
or
it
may
not,
it
may
have
the
instant
tailor
and
it
may
not
be
able
to
make
loans
but
it
is
permitted
to
have
all
of
the
attributes
of
a
bank.
i
mean,
the
general
business
of
the
bank
may
--
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
a
branch
would
not,
no
sir.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
yeah,
sir
i
was
directing
myself
to
what
the
business
that
they
could
conduct.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that's
correct,
yeah
sir.
the
bank
itself
has
the
president
and
a
board
of
directors,
each
branch
will
have
a
branch
manager,
just
like
a
division
of
a
corporation,
it
is
not
a
separate
entity.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
alright.
there
are
numerous
other
statutes.
in
some
of
them,
it
might
in
fact
be
desirable
to
apply
every
place,
the
bank
has
a
branch.
publications
of,
as
i
say
directors
meetings
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
might
be
that
it
is
desirable
for
the
bank
to
publish
them
not
only
in
the
place
where
it
is
located
as
specified
in
the
statute
but
also
all
over
the
state,
every
place
it
has
a
branch.
i
would
suggest
though
that
it
is
that
sort
of
argument
that
ought
to
be
directed
to
the
congress
and
not
directed
to
this
court
and
whether
it
is
desirable
policy
for
a
bank
to
be
sued
everywhere
or
whether
it
is
desirable
policy
to
have
controller's
reports
published
everywhere.
it's
something
we
cannot
answer
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
so
particularly
with
regard
to
the
reserve
requirement
your
honor
because
there
it
would
seem
like
congress
certainly
would
not
intend
to
create
a
confusion
by
using
the
word
'located'
to
define
the
specific
reserve
requirements
for
a
bank
depending
on
the
county
whether
that
it
was
located
in,
that
is,
whether
it
be
a
central
reserve
county
or
whether
it
be
another
county.
by
the
saying
that
the
bank
is
located
everywhere
then
that
provision
becomes
almost
unmanageable
that
would
seem
to
me.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
as
i
say
i
tried
to
summarize
too
quickly
and
they
are
not
cited
in
the
brief
but
there
are
about
8
more
statutes
that
were
enacted
in
1864.
one
of
the
statutes
concerns
the
requirements
for
maintaining
reserves,
i
mean
this
is
not
a
publication
statute
and
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
that
that
statute
was
necessarily
passed
in
1864
but
the
statute
provides
that
if
you
are
located
in
a
reserve
city,
you
will
have
a
reserve
requirement
of
'x',
if
you
are
not
located
in
a
reserve
city,
you
have
another
reserve
that
is
not
a
publication
that
actually
directs
you
as
to
how
much
reserve
you
may
have.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
at
least.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
under
all
of
the
statutes
that
would
be
correct,
yes
sir.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
courts
in
diligence
to
consider
the
waiver
argument
because
many
state
courts
having
concluded
that
located
and
established
refer
to
only
one
county
then
turned
right
around
and
say
however
this
venue
requirement
is
waved
by
the
erection
and
maintenance
of
a
branch
in
another
county.
that
argument
is
not
found
on
judicial
precedent
and
if
the
court
would
think
about
it
as
i
know
it
will,
it
occurs
to
me
that
never
before
in
american
jurisprudence
have
we
decided
that
venue
can
be
waved
presumptively
by
pre-litigation
conduct,
the
only
case
that
even
suggests
that,
if
that
sort
of
rule
was
adopted
every
case
that
comes
before
a
trial
court,
the
judge
is
now
going
to
be
faced
with
an
argument
of
he
presumptively
waved
venue
by
some
conduct
inconsistent
with
it,
in
advance
of
trial.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
neirbo
trade
very
lightly
on
this
matter
and
was
a
very
narrow
holding
and
it
involved
the
corporation
who
specifically
appointed
a
registered
agent
for
service
of
process.
mr.
william
c.
humphreys,
jr.
but
that
was
very
narrow,
they
found
to
express
consent
to
be
sued
by
the
appointment
of
agent
for
service
of
process
and
i
would
suggest
that
neirbo
can
never
be
cited
or
used
without
considering
olberding
which
was
decided
in
1953,
by
justice
frankfurt
because
neirbo
be
read
too
expansively
or
can
be
used
too
expansively
without
reading
olberding
because
in
olberding
the
argument
was
made
that
a
non
resident
motorist
passing
through
the
state,
and
this
was
not
a
jurisdiction
question
this
was
on
venue,
they
had
decided
constitutionality
of
the
non
resident
motorist
statute.
but
this
non
resident
motorist
was
passing
through
a
state
and
for
some
reason
venue
requirements
were
not
met
because
neither
the
plaintiff
nor
defendant
were
residents
of
that
state
and
the
defendant
assorted
his
venue
right
and
the
court
said,
now
you
waived
venue
because
we
have
got
our
non
resident
statute
that
says
when
you
are
passing
through
the
state
you
waive
a
venue,
if
you
have
an
automobile
wreck
and
you
appoint
the
secretary
of
state
to
receive
process
although
there
no
specific
appointment
was
made.
and
justice
frankfurt
has
said
that
but
to
conclude
that
a
motorist
who
never
consented
to
be
sued
has
agreed
to
be
sued
and
therefore
waived
federal
court
venue
as
to
move
in
the
world
of
alice
in
wonderland.
in
other
words,
that
non
resident
motorist
had
not
consented
expressly
to
be
sued.
there
is
no
case
that
this
court
has
considered
other
than
neirbo
in
which
a
pre-litigation
waiver
has
been
allowed
and
in
neirbo
the
court
was
very
specific
to
say
that
it
was
because
they
had
expressly
appointed
an
agent
for
service
of
process
and
therefore
had
expressly
consented
to
be
sued.
now
what
the
proponents
of
the
waiver
argument
would
seek
now
is
to
say
that
any
act
inconsistent
with
assorting
venue
that
you
do
prior
to
trial
will
result
in
waiver
of
venue
such
as
erecting
a
branch
bank.
well
i
submit
that
individuals
do
things
all
the
time
in
consistent
with
the
normal
state
venue
right
of
to
be
sued
in
your
home
county.
but
no
court
has
ever
said
that
because
if
you
are
an
individual,
you
go
to
another
county
and
commit
a
tort
that
you
have
waived
venue,
you
have
a
waived
venue
if
the
statute
says
you
have
a
right
to
be
sued
where
you
live,
you
do
not
waive
that
statute
prior
to
litigation,
and
that
is
what
we
would
contend
this
statute
says
that
the
bank
has
a
right
to
be
sued
where
it
maintains
its
home
offices.
thank
you.
