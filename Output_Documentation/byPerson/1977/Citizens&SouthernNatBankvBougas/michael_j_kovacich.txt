mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
mike
kovacich.
i
think
mr.
humphreys
has
outlined
to
you
the
crunch
of
the
matter
and
it
basically
boils
down
to
a
statutory
interpretation
and
there
have
been
decisions
which
were
cited
in
the
briefs
from
various
lower
federal
courts
and
state
appellate
courts
dealing
with
this
question
in
recent
years.
this
case
is
revolved
basically
around
two
theories
of
interpretation,
as
far
as
holding
for
the
position
which
i
contend
is
proper.
the
first
theory,
and
this
was
the
one
predominantly
followed
by
the
georgia
court
is
the
dichotomy
in
language
between
the
words
established
and
located.
the
ruling
was
basically
and
because
of
this
dichotomy
in
language,
once
the
bank
set
up
a
branch,
county
other
than
its
chartered
county,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
that
it
was
located
there,
and
could
be
sued
there,
and
therefore
in
compliance
with
the
statute.
the
second
theory
is
that
of
waiver.
that
is
that
act
of
establishing
a
branch
bank
in
and
of
itself
constituted
waiver.
this
is
what
mr.
humphreys
discussed
when
he
said
pre-litigation
waiver.
that
is
the
basis
of
the
decisions
in
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
and
in
some
of
the
state
court
decisions
which
are
also
cited.
but
as
i
said
it
revolves
around
this
question
of
interpreting
the
statute
as
to
litigation
in
federal
court
which
is
not
really
what
we
have
got
here
but
it
has
been
brought
in
for
a
consideration
and
looking
at
the
entire
picture,
i
would
agree
with
mr.
humphreys,
that
the
established
does
mean
that
particular
county.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
quite
a
case
for
state
litigation
and
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
concede
that,
but
i
think
as
some
of
these
federal
decisions
have
held
the
establishment
or
the
conduct
of
business.
there
were
one
or
two
decisions
and
there
is
also
a
recent
florida
appellate
decision
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
doing
business
and
this
gets
us
in
part
as
to
what
is
required.
some
of
these
cases
have
contained
a
recitation
of
like
the
reeves
(ph)
case,
the
66
branches
in
the
southern
district
of
california
and
all
of
that,
the
wyle
(ph)
and
this
brings
upon
the
question
that
justice
rehnquist
posed
before
in
wyle
(ph).
you
may
not
be
aware
that
dekalb
and
fulton
counties
are
bordered
next
to
each
other
and
part
of
the
city
of
atlanta
is
located
in
dekalb.
i
think
that
as
mr.
humphrey's
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
indicates
a
considerable
portion
of
cns's
business
by
volume
as
in
dekalb
and
fulton
counties.
i
am
sure
the
business
in
dekalb
is
several
times
what
it
is
in
chatham
county.
and
as
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
about
their
using
the
courts
in
dekalb,
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
was
earlier
litigation
dealing
with
one
of
the
loans
that
led
to
the
unlawful
redemption
as
we
have
alleged
in
our
petition.
it
was
litigation
in
regard
to
that,
filed
by
the
bank
in
the
exact
court
that
this
litigation
--
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no
i
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
i
am
raising
here
is
the
fact
that
besides
using
the
court,
the
bank
has
established
branches
and
is
conducting
active
business
and
uses
the
courts
as
a
part
of
conducting
that
business
and
has
become
a
part
and
parcel
of
that
county
and
this
leads
into
somewhat
the
point
that
mr.
humphreys
raised
about,
does
going
to
another
county
and
committing
a
tort
waive
an
individual's
venue,
and
he
said
no
it
would
not.
i
believe,
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
but
many
states
georgia
included,
provide
a
corporation
can
be
sued
in
any
county
in
which
it
commits
a
tort.
you
can
sue
a
corporation
in
a
county
where
the
tort
is
committed
or
in
a
contract
matter
where
the
contract
is
entered.
so
i
think
courts
have
recognized
different
jurisdictional
and
venue
requirements
as
to
corporations.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
statute
is
fairly
clear
and
i
think
that
that
situation
--
.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no,
we
do
not
your
honor
and
because
of
this
courts
decision
in
the
mercantile
case
that
is
holding
that
12
usc
section
94
was
mandatory.
that
therefore
pre-empts
the
georgia
statute
for
the
determination
of
where
cns
can
be
sued
and
the
determination
has
to
be
made
under
this
statute.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no
i
would
not
go
that
far
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
there
has
to
be
some
connection
to
that
county.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
i
think
maybe
because
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
i
think
of
the
georgia
venue
statute
as
to
corporations
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
sue
a
corporation
over
a
tort
or
a
contract,
you
have
to
have
some
connection
to
the
county
other
than
just
finding
him
there.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
yeah.
well
of
course
the
bank
is
contending
that
the
chatham
is
the
only
place
that
--
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
under
my
theory
if
there
were
no
ties,
no
transactions,
no
part
of
these
transactions
in
chatham
county,
then
the
only
way
that
i
could
sue
there
is
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
a
special
additional
venue.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
i
am
not
aware
of
any
transactions
or
any
part
of
this
entire
matter
which
were
conducted
in
fulton
county.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no
i
do
not,
now
i
think
some
of
the
decisions
referred
to
in
my
brief
imply
that
possibly
that
is
the
case.
the
waiver
or
the
establishment
of
the
branch
that
knowing
business
decision
to
open
the
branch
and
all
the
ramifications
that
imposes,
includes
the
right
to
be
sued
there.
now,
some
of
these
decisions
though
do
contain
the
qualifying
language
or
the
limitation
that
there
must
be
transactions
that
arose
out
of
that,
otherwise
i
would
think
the
original
purpose
of
the
statute
that
being
to
protect
the
banks,
national
banks
and
their
infancy
at
that
time
from
cumbersome
litigation
would
be
thwarted
and
i
think
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
that
is
a
legitimate
purpose
today,
but
assuming
that
it
is.
i
think
that
the
same
purpose
is
accomplished
by
limiting
the
litigations
to
counties,
which
have
some
connection.
i
will
not
say
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
series
of
four,
five
different
actions
including
two
separate
notes
and
you
know
the
record
does
not
show
and
the
way
this
case
was
involved.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well
as
i
say,
or
i
think
some
of
the
decisions
do
not
--.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well
i
guess
from
the
stand
point
of
the
the
fairness
aspect,
i
do
that
in
my
mind
that
this
could
possibly
be
burdensome
to
the
bank
and
i
think
really
fairness
is
one
aspect
that
we
have
to
consider
in
this.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
i
think
to
a
certain
degree
and
to
me,
it
is
thinking
from
the
fact
that
to
resolve
this
question
which
is
gone
through
extensive
litigation
and
many
courts
recently,
that
this
courts
decision
or
it
might
be
desirable
that
this
court's
decision
also
address
itself
to
the
federal
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
on
the
waiver
theory
because
the
dichotomy
of
language
definitely
does
not
exist
and
apply
to
the
federal
situation.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
this
i
think
that
is
one
theory
of
application
and
i
think
that
is
a
theory
--.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
if
you
follow
my
contention
that
the
establishment
of
the
branch
constitutes
a
waiver
at
least
for
transactions
arising
out
of
this.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
as
far
as
the
federal
is
concerned
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
why
i
think
we
get
into
the
fairness
question
and
this
touches
upon
the
matter
that
mr
justice
marshall
raised
before
in
regard
to
the
galveston,
el
paso
situations.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no
i
am
not
your
honor,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
rewrite
the
statue.
i
am
suggesting
that
you
interpret
the
statue
and
you
decide
what
constitutes
a
waiver
of
the
prerogatives
that
the
bank
has
under
the
statue
and
i
would
contend
to
you
that
the
establishment
of
the
branch
should
be
a
sufficient
act
to
a
constitute
waiver,
at
least
as
to
transactions
arising
out
of
the
conduct
of
business
in
that
branch.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
i
do
not
think,
in
that
sense
may
be
that
there
was
notice
your
honor,
but
i
think
also
on
the
same
bank
if
an
individual
say
in
a
fulton
county
georgia,
goes
into
see
and
ask
to
transact
business
with
them,
do
they
tell
him
look
if
this
does
not
go
the
way
you
want
it
and
you
decide
you
have
to
sue
us
that
you
have
go
to
savannah,
i
am
sure
they
do
not
and
so
--.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
i
would
think
that
it
could
be,
i
mean
you
could
argue
and
i
am
sure
that
would
be
the
bank's
position
that
they
must
make
a
annoying
waiver
and
they
must
be
put
on
some
kind
of
a
notice
but
i
really
do
not
know
any
way
to
put
bank
on
any
type
of
notice
as
to
what
are
the
ramifications
of
establishing
a
branch
bank.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
i
think
that
going
into
that
county
assumes
some
ramifications
of
it.
it
is
a
knowing
business
decision
and
i
am
sure
when
they
go
in
there
they
do
not
know
what
the
tax,
they
may
not
know
what
the
tax
structure
or
the
tax
rate
is
going
to
be,
but
they
presume
and
know
that
they
have
to
pay,
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
some
type
of
taxes
and
as
far
as
this
you
know
this
point
it
is
--
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well,
that
is
the
interpretation
that
the
bank
has
been
operating
under.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
well
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
your
honor,
some
courts
including
state
appellate
courts
and
federal
courts
had
held.
that
this
is
not
what
the
statue
means
because
by
the
establishment
of
the
branch,
the
bank
waives
venue.
there
are
decisions
on
both
sides
of
that
and
in
the
fairness
question,
i
think
probably
the
most
classic
is
the
halco
case,
where
a
new
york
bank
had
established
a
branch
in
the
virgin
islands
and
the
transaction
and
everything
arose
out
of
the
activities
of
the
branch
in
the
virgin
islands.
now,
there
the
third
circuit's
holding
was
that
the
individual
had
to
go
to
new
york,
to
sue
the
bank.
but
there
are
other
federal
decisions
including
one
that
crosses
state
lines
that
hold
that
the
establishment
of
the
branch
is
a
waiver.
one
were,
the
bank
was
established
in
camden,
new
jersey
and
the
branch
in
philadelphia,
and
the
district
court
in
philadelphia
held
that
the
establishment
there
was
sufficient
action
to
constitute
a
waiver.
now
some
of
the
decisions
have
looked
at
other
business,
are
the
extensive
business
of
the
branches
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
hard
to
write
any
definitive
standards
there.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
i
think
probably
is,
if
that
had
been
the
situation
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
since
our
office
had
been
handling
the
litigation
in
prior
action,
we
might
have
gone
down
to
fulton.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
no.
no
mine,
mine
is
a
small
suburban
firm.
but
i
think
one
other
point
that
this
deals
with
is,
each
of
the
branches
has
a
branch
manager
who
is
generally
also
a
vice
president,
who
can
be
an
agent
for
service,
and
the
fact
and
that
is
how
service
was
perfected
in
this
case
and
how
it
has
been
in
other
cases,
but
besides
the
fairness
is
as
an
argument
is
difficult
to
make,
but
i
think
the
statue
is
subject
to
interpretation
on
either,
the
basis
of
a
waiver
theory
and
for
this
court
to
defensively
say
what
actions
constitute
a
waiver.
i
would
contend
that
the
establishment
of
a
branch
in
and
of
itself
is
sufficient.
the
other
as
i
said
and
this
was
the
basis
on
which
the
george
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
decision,
is
that
by
establishing
a
branch
bank,
the
bank
located
itself
in
that
respective
county,
for
suit
under
that
court's
interpretation
of
this
act
without
getting
in
to
any
waiver
but
i
think
that
on
either
application
that
the
motion
of
the
bank,
the
original
motion
of
the
bank
to
be
dismissed
was
properly
denied
and
i
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm,
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
of
appeal.
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
mr.
kovacich,
may
i
ask
you
question?
i
think
throughout
the
argument
both
parties
seem
to
assume
that
when
a
federal
venue
is
sought
to
be
established,
the
bank
can
be
established
only
in
one
place
and
that
the
branch
would
not
be
established
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue.
has
this
court
ever
so
held?
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
the
reason
that
both
parties
have
taken
that
position
is
one
we
have
not
gone
into
that
aspect
of
it
and
as
great
of
depth
as
we
are
dealing
with
the
state
court
issue
and
secondly
the
statue
uses
the
word
'established'
in
regard
to
the
federal
district
and
as
i
understand
that
the
federal
laws
which
set
up
the
procedure
for
a
bank
a
national
bank
being
chartered
also
used
that
exact
term
'established'
and
so
from
that
you
draw
possibly,
an
intention
to
mean
the
same
thing
and
therefore
you
do
get
this
home
county
aspect
but
to
my
knowledge
as
far
as
--
mr.
michael
j.
kovacich
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
