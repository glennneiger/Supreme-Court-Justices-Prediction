unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
how
many
georgia
counties
does
the
cns
still
have
banks?
unknown
speaker
in
many
counties?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
taking
the
position
that
even
though
you
have
a
branch
in
the
dekalb
county
that
suit
may
be
not
be
brought
there
if
it
is
not
on
a
transaction
arising
out
of,
well
may
not
be
brought
there.
it
has
to
go
to
savannah.
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
the
volumes
--
so
suppose
if
someone
brought
suit
against
you
in
fulton
county
at
atlanta,
and
the
volume
of
business
done
by
cns
in
fulton
county
was
20
times
what
it
was
in
savannah,
you
would
still
say
they
had
to
go
to
savannah
to
sue
you.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
home
office,
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
synonymous
with
registered
office.
in
my
state,
a
corporation
has
to
reside
in
its
certificate
of
incorporation,
if
its
registered
there.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
there
are
some
statues
that
require
at
the
home
office
the
conduct
of
some
kinds
of
business,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
of
what
kinds?
unknown
speaker
is
that
why
you
are
in
savannah
and
not
atlanta?
unknown
speaker
has
this
bank,
has
the
cns
everywhere
itself
used
by
courts
of
dekalb
county?
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure
it
must
be.
mr.
humphreys
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
in
this
reserve
calculation,
i
take
it
reserves
throughout
the
bank,
all
of
the
bank
branches
are
counted
in
calculating
reserves.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
statute
and
my
second
question
is
that
would
preclude
you
from
closing
your
banking
activities
in
savannah
but
retaining
your
office
for
director's
meeting
and
the
like
there.
say
you
decide
all
your
banking
in
atlanta
but
keep
your
home
office
in
savannah,
could
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
because
that
only
relates
to
moving
the
home
office,
that
isn't
relevant
to
the
question
whether
you
could
discontinue
banking?
unknown
speaker
what
limitations
--
who
was
doing
branching
under
georgia
law?
unknown
speaker
did
georgia
ever
have
a
situation
that
i
understand
prevails
in
some
states
in
which
no
branch
as
well
had
whatever,
perhaps
no
branch
at
the
atlantic
county
in
which
the
home
office
is
located.
unknown
speaker
but
now
as
so
far
as
a
law
is
concerned,
your
bank
could
have
a
branch
in
every
county
of
georgia?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
a
hundred
and
some
--
how
many
counties
in
georgia
--
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to
tell
us
what
your
justification
for
opposing
this
venue
is?
unknown
speaker
is
that
all
just
the
statute
if
there
isn't
any
policy
justification?
unknown
speaker
but
were
there
any
branch
banks
in
1864?
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
derive
that
intention
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
why
can
not
the
bank
remove
in
a
situation
like
that?
unknown
speaker
since
1882
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
langdeau
case
helped
you
much
or
it
hurts?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
prevailed
over
the
state.
unknown
speaker
it
held
that
it
had
to
be.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
question
there
about
where
the
bank
was
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
when
this
statute
was
passed,
how
many
states
had
more
than
one
federal
district?
unknown
speaker
now,
was
there
a
state
that
had
one
on
one
circuit
courts,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
or
having
more
than
one
district
court.
unknown
speaker
there
were
states
with
one
on
one
district
courts.
unknown
speaker
how
about
more
than
one
on
one
state?
unknown
speaker
i
suspect,
you
could
find
it
in
the
front
pages
of
35
federal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
humphreys,
what
significance
if
any
do
you
attach
to
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927
authorizing
national
banks
to
branch
and
using
the
word
establish
with
respect
to
branches.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
main
office
would
not
have
its
own
president
and
board
of
directors,
the
president
and
board
of
directors
would
be
over
the
main
office
in
all
the
branches?
unknown
speaker
mr.
humphreys,
would
you
help?
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
are
requirements
that
such
as
publishing
the
amount
of
reserves
or
something
like
that,
what
is
the
purpose
of
requirement
like
that,
to
inform
people
who
do
business
with
the
bank,
what
it
sizes
in
the
like?
what
are
the
requirements
you
are
talking
about
apply
all
over?
may
be
they
should
apply
every
place
at
the
bank.
i
did
not
quite
get
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
may
be
congress
has
already
answered
that.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
requirement
only
related
to
the
place
where
publication
had
to
be
made
rather
than
the
content
of
the
publication.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
the
neirbo
case?
unknown
speaker
which
is
pre-litigation
conduct
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
kovacich,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
your
procedure.
do
you
feel
that
you
could
sue
this
bank
in
any
county,
in
state
court
of
any
county
in
georgia
where
it
has
a
branch,
whether
this
particular
transaction
arose
out
of
business
from
that
branch.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
draw
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
you
could
sue
in
savannah,
or
chatham
counties
of
georgia?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
do
you
think
you
can
sue
there?
so
at
least
on
your
theory
you
have
two
counties
which
you
could
sue,
the
chatham
and
dekalb.
regardless
of
where
the
defense
actually--
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
it
again.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
on
your
theory
then
you
can
sue
only
in
chatham
county
or
dekalb
county
not
in
fulton?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
go
all
the
away
and
say
because
there
was
a
full
service
branch
in
the
county
whatever
that
means,
speaking
terminology,
that
you
can
sue
the
bank
in
that
county?
unknown
speaker
you
confused
me
a
little
bit,
i
suppose
i
am
not
tracking
but
i
thought
you
were
are
approaching
this
initially
on
a
basis
of
statutory
interpretation
and
then
i
hence
i
am
wondering
why
you
include
the
county
of
the
branch
or
the
transaction
but
exclude
a
county,
where
there
is
another
branch
and
no
transaction.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
asking
about
you,
and
not
those
decisions.
unknown
speaker
well
on
that
approach,
do
you
not
to
lose
your
construction
argument
and
are
you
not
forced
go
on
into
a
waiver
theory?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say,
okay
if
it
does
not
mean
established?
unknown
speaker
what
you
would
say
about
national
bank
that
exists
in
a
state,
that
has
two
districts
and
it
has
branches
in
two
districts
and
have
one
as
its
home
office
and
another
as
a
branch
in
another
district.
where
may
it
be
sued?
let
us
assume
that
a
suit
is
brought
in
the
district,
federal
district
court,
in
the
district
where
it
has
a
branch
but
that
is
not
its
own
house
office,
can
it
be
sued
there?
unknown
speaker
except
on
the
waiver
you
would
have
to
say
that
it
could
brought
in
only
one
district,
except
for
the
waiver.
unknown
speaker
your
suggestion,
we
just
rewrite
the
statue
in
a
fair
way?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
holding
by
this
court
that
a
federal,
that
the
branch
of
a
national
bank
is
not
established
in
the
county
and
in
which
the
branch
is
located.
there
is
no
holding
by
this
court.
