i
just
remembered,
there
must
have
been
plenty
of
states
with
just
one
district
court,
because
i
remember
correctly,
maryland
has
still
got
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
state
of
texas,
the
bank
that
is
chartered
in
galveston
and
a
branch
in
el
paso
had
to
turn
out
that
since
it
were
taking
about
three
days
to
get
there,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
would
apply,
your
statute
would
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
as
of
today
that
bank
had
published
whatever
they
want
in
the
galveston
daily
paper
is
noticed
in
el
paso.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
notice,
the
bank
did
not
get
that
notice.
when
was
the
bank
told
that
if
it
established
a
branch,
they
would
be
subject
to
suit
in
that
county?
waiver
is
annoying
waiver.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
he
goes
into
an
ordinary
corporations,
it
still
is
the
same
thing
there,
is
it
not?
it
has
extended
the
law
but
you
termed
that
a
waiver.
well,
i
say
waiver
has
been
knowingly
made.
when
bank
had
to
know
that,
when
they
established
a
branch
bank
that
they
will
waive
then,
the
statue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
otherwise
can
you
waive
a
statue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
bank
know
that
it
is
the
statue
tells
them,
that
they
can
only
sued
in
savannah,
that
they
know
and
the
statute
says
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
this
is
what
the
statue
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
do,
where
the
banks
has
its
office
in
fulton
county
and
a
branch
in
dekalb
county,
that
all
in
couple
of
feats,
how
would
your
fairness
work
there?
you
are
suing
either
one,
i
guess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
office
has
a
branch
in
fulton
county?
