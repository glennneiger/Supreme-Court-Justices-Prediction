unknown
speaker
mr.
aikens,
i
am
curious
about
one
fact,
does
the
record
show
that
everybody
under
this
plan
was
discharged
at
age
60
by
united?
unknown
speaker
no
exceptions
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
a
person
is
retired
in
other
section
and
then
applies
for
reemployment?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
possible
--
what
would
you
say
to
–
what
would
united
say
to
the
person
applied?
unknown
speaker
would
not
the
company
at
least
have
to
say
we
will
reemploy
you
but
you
will
have
give
up
your
pensions?
unknown
speaker
or
the
reason
--
you
are
suggesting
the
reason
that
they
would
refuse
to
reemploy
him
as
he
is
retired
pensioner
not
that
he
is
too
old.
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
a
logical
extension
of
his
election
to
be
on
the
pension
plan.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
to
interrupt
that
--
were
there
cases
in
the
other
circuits
--
did
the
cases
in
the
other
circuits
involve
pension
plans
where
people
had
the
option
to
elect
in
or
out?
unknown
speaker
did
any
of
them
involve
situations
where
once
you
are
employed,
you
are
under
the
plan
willy-nilly
and
there
is
no
way
out
of
it?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
that
just
sounds
like
there
was
not
mandatory
retirement
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
much
of
a
conflict.
there
is
nothing
--
unknown
speaker
the
first
circuit
rule
in
taft
broadcasting,
any
good
faith
retirement
plan
that
was
established
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute
of
1967,
would
permit
in
your
submission,
the
involuntary
retirement
of
any
employee
at
whatever
age
that
plan
provides
--
it
could
not
be
a
subterfuge
that
is
your
submission
is.
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
good
faith
is
the
english
translation
of
bonne
foi.
unknown
speaker
were
retirement
plan
without
any
benefits,
there
is
no
difference
than
a
discharge.
unknown
speaker
on
what
point
would
the
amount
of
benefits
distinguish
between
what
is
bona
fide
and
what
is
not?
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
does
not
use
the
word
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
it
is
bona
fide
and
whether
or
not
it
is
subterfuge.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
was
your
submission,
mr.
aikens
that
no
plan
that
has
been
added
in
to
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
act,
it
would
possibly
be
a
subterfuge.
unknown
speaker
it
might
or
might
not
be
bona
fide
--
the
statute
sets
up
two
criteria,
does
it
not?
it
has
to
be
both
bona
fide
and
not
a
subterfuge.
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
it
was
your
submission
that
no
plan
that
antedated
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
could
possibly
be
a
subterfuge.
it
might
not
be
bona
fide
but
it
could
not
be
the
subterfuge.
is
that
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
that
could
not
be.
unknown
speaker
how
could
a
post-
act
bona
fide
plan
be
a
subterfuge?
unknown
speaker
post
act
bona
fide
plan,
how
could
that
be
a
subterfuge?
are
those
words
mutually
inconsistent?
unknown
speaker
then
is
the
statute
redundant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
aikens,
i
suppose
there
is
also
a
theory
which
is
suggested
although
not
completely
explicit
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
that
when
there
are
adequate
pension
benefits
as
opposed
to
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
discharge
with
no
pension,
you
really
do
not
have
a
discharge
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
that
position
or
do
rely
exclusively
on
4(f)(2)?
unknown
speaker
what
were
in
fact
the
benefits
received
by
mr.
mcmann
under
this
plan,
he
did
not
elect
to
go
under
it
until
his
51st
birthday.
unknown
speaker
then
he
had
only
nine
years
of
employment
before
his
retirement
and
what
were
his
benefits
in
terms
of
a
percentage
of
his
average
wages
or
highest
three
year
wages
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
aopa,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
a
month?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
his
salary
at
the
time
of
his
retirement
approximately?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
know
what
percentage
this
was
of
his
salary
or?
unknown
speaker
well
does
united
do
that
for
everybody
or
who
has
just
been
in
plan
nine
years?
unknown
speaker
do
they
say
they
paid
after
this
lawsuit
or
before
it?
unknown
speaker
before
his
retirement
he
had
been
in
touch
with
the
labor
department
indicating
his
intention
to
proceed
out
of
this
tax
--
unknown
speaker
did
–
i
suppose
united
knew
about
that?
unknown
speaker
just
as
so
i
got
it
straight.
in
order
for
us
to
agree
with
you
but
we
have
to
reach
the
question
and
deal
with
it
as
to
whether
the
statute,
whether
4(f)
or
whatever
the
exemption
is,
covers
a
plan
that
is
obligatory
on
the
employee
but
optional
on
the
employer,
your
plan
united
could
have
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
retained
any
employee
beyond
60.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
they
never
had--
unknown
speaker
certainly
there
was
a
strong
dissent
in
the
fifth
circuit
on
judge
tuttle
saying
that
the
exemption
was
not
even
meant
to
cover
a
plan
that
was
optional
on
the
employee.
now
that
fourth
circuit
put
that
issue
aside
because
it
decided
against
you
an
another
ground,
but
do
we
have
to,
what
do
we
about
that
question,
do
we
have
to
deal
with
it
here?
assume
we
agreed
with
you
otherwise
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
is
the
argument
is,
the
company
still
has
the
option
--
that
congress
only
intended
to
permit
the
company
to
or
to
exempt
a
plan
that
was
obligatory
both
ways.
that
was
the
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
well
that
maybe
so
but
do
we
have
to
reach
it,
if
we
hold
for
you?
and
not
to
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
submission
was
that,
while
normal,
and
may
not
have
dictionary
meaning
of
mandatory,
that
in
fact
it
was
equivalent
to
mandatory
under
your
plan
and
that
has
been
historically
administered
and
that
is
what
professor
cox
found
in
the
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
now
that
means
mandatory
in
fact.
as
a
matter
of
the
historic
administration
of
this
plan.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
arbitration
panel
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
aikens,
am
i
correct
there
are
not
some
legislation
pending
in
the
congress
today
that
ties
right
in
to
this
problem.
unknown
speaker
does
it
have
bearing
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
realized,
of
course,
that
large
majority
of
this
court
is
beyond
the
age
of
60
and
do
you
think
that
we
should
all
(inaudible)
ourselves
and
that
you
go
else
where.
unknown
speaker
mr.
aikens,
may
i
just
ask
says
one
other
question?
on
the
question
of
the
amount
of
benefits
for
your
adversary,
stipulation
exhibit
3
does
give
dollar
figures,
$420
and
$840
was
his
first
check.
is
there
any
thing
else
in
the
record
that
gives
a
precise
dollars
or
we
are
just
giving?
unknown
speaker
or
younger
workers,
it
is
equally
violation
of
the
act
to
discriminate
against
somebody
because
it
was
youth
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
you
discriminate
against
somebody
because
he
is
only
40.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
it
was
not
on
the
mind
of
congress
but
that
what
is
the
language
of
the
statute
says.
unknown
speaker
that
is
covered
by
the
bfoq
language
of
the
statutes
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
might
also
should
then
recovered
by
the
faa
regulations
and
perhaps
also
by
the
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
aopa.
unknown
speaker
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
you
made
clear
that
in
your
view
at
least
whether
something
is
bona
fide
is
quite
a
different
question
from
whether
or
not
it
is
a
subterfuge,
by
something
i
mean
a
pension
plan.
unknown
speaker
that
there
are
two
separate
and
quite
distinct
tests.
unknown
speaker
alright.
and
that
we
have
to
assume
that
they
meant
different
things
they
were
not
indulging
in
totality.
and
your
understanding
of
the
meaning
bona
fide
is
that
it
provides
reasonable
benefits
that
the
plan
provides
reasonable
benefits--
unknown
speaker
or
whether
it
is
complete.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
that
is
one
criteria
and
if
whether
or
not
it
provides
--
the
plan
provides
the
reasonable
benefits.
unknown
speaker
retirement
benefits.
what
is
the
test
in
your
submission,
what
is
the
meaning
of
--
in
your
submission
of
whether
or
not
a
plan
is
a
subterfuge?
unknown
speaker
it
has
not
to
do
with
reasonable
benefits.
unknown
speaker
let
us
not,
if
you
can
to
use
polar
words.
if
it
is
a
sole
reason
for
mandatory
retirement
under
65,
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
well
then
pension
plan,
that
even
though
it
provided
reasonable
benefits
was
there
for
bona
fide
would
nonetheless
be
a
subterfuge
and
not
covered
by
this
exception
to
the
general
provision
of
the
act,
if
it
in
fact
provided
for
mandatory
retirement
under
65,
unless
there
were
some
but
other
reason?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
that
other
reason
had
to
be
some
economic
--
unknown
speaker
is
it
like
a
policeman
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride,
i
would
think
the
dictionary
definition
of
a
subterfuge
is
something
that
says
one
thing
and
means
another.
it
is
something
that
purports
to
be
okay
but
really
is
not
and
by
your
interpretation,
if
a
contract
that
says
in
so
many
words,
we
are
going
to
retire
you
at
65
or
60
and
give
you
these
pension
benefits,
that
makes
it
perfectly
clear
and
does
not
dissemble
it
at
all.
it
is
nonetheless
a
subterfuge.
unknown
speaker
well
it
has
to
be
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
this
act.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
be
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act
it
has
to
be
a
subterfuge
to
start
out
with
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
do
you
think
you
have
to
show
that
this
plan
was
a
subterfuge
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act?
unknown
speaker
what
other
grounds
could
you
prevail
on?
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
been?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
made
any
difference
had
it
been
the
product
of
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
statute
regardless
of
--.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
in
effect
held.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride,
may
i
ask
you.
do
i
correctly
understand
you,
few
moments
ago
to
say
that
you
so
not
have
to
urge
affirmance
on
the
subterfuge
arguments
but
may
do
so
on
the
basis
of
the
plan
and
indeed
does
not
mandate
retirement
age
60.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
fourth
circuit
expressly
said
that
it
concludes
for
the
purposes
of
this
decision,
that
the
plan
should
be
required
as
one
mandating
retirement.
now
you
did
not
cross
petition
but
you
nevertheless
argue
it
either
that
your
liberty
to
ask
affirmance
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
the
respect.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
pending
legislations
of
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride
what
is
left
in
the
exception?
if
that
is
enacted,
what
is
left
in
the
exception?
unknown
speaker
could
you
read
that
language
again,
if
you
do
not
mind?
unknown
speaker
now
this
is
an
addition
to
two.
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
only
addition
to
two?
unknown
speaker
is
the
discussion
over
there
made
clear
whether
or
not
that
would
apply
to
previously
negotiated
plans?
which
operate
in
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
amendments
to
that,
have
there
not,
some
committee
exempting
teachers
and
professors,
we
really
do
not
know
what
shape
the
thing
might
come
out
--
unknown
speaker
and
this
is.
unknown
speaker
passed
by
one
house.
by
the
house
of
representatives?
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
seeking
damages
as
well
as
reinstatement,
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
so
the
case
would
not
be
moot?
unknown
speaker
it
is
in
1967?
that
is
when
the
act
was
passed.
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
back
in
1967?
unknown
speaker
oh
he
said
a
similar
thing
back
in
1967?
unknown
speaker
we
have
said
things
alright
about
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
have
said
on
many
occasions
that
we
look
rather
scamps
at
post.
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
not
filed
an
amicus
brief
here.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
significance
in
that?
unknown
speaker
they
should
file
on
their
own.
unknown
speaker
so
they
frequently
do
it
on
their
own
and
--
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
whether
there
was
some
significance
in
the
absence
of
such
a
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride,
i
do
not
like
to
press
this
again
but
i
would
like
to
be
very
clear.
you
are
arguing
to
us
that
you
are
entirely
on
affirmance
on
one
of
two
grounds.
either
that
4
(f)
2
is
not
applicable
at
all
because
this
is
not
a
mandatory
retirement
plan
or
even
if
4(f)
2
is
applicable,
its
conditions
have
not
been
satisfied
by
the
united.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
on
either
ground.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcbride
did
has
the
department
ever
withdrawn
its
earlier
interpreted
bulletins?
unknown
speaker
are
they
contrary
to
your
present
view.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
department
of
labor
if
it
was
here
and
standing
where
and
it
representing
and
was
standing
where
you
are
would
suggest
that
their
position
in
their
amicus
brief
is
not
different
form
the
interpreted
bulletin?
unknown
speaker
did
they
argue
--
does
they
have
brief
argue
that
their
position
has
always
been
the
same?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
interpreted
bulletin
--
well
i
will
put
it
this
way.
does
the
department
agree
with
you
on
your
alternate
suggestions
that
the
exemption
does
not
apply
at
all
if
the
company
may
itself
permit
a
person
to
stay
beyond
the
retirement
age?
unknown
speaker
let
me
read
it
the
interpret
bulletin.
the
fact
that
an
employer
may
decide
where
in
certain
employers
to
continue
working
beyond
the
age
stipulated
in
the
formal
retirement
program
does
not
in
and
of
itself
render
an
otherwise
bona
fide
plan
invalid.
now
that
is
--
is
that
vague
or
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
well
if
the
interpreted
bulletin
seems
contrary
to
your
alternate
positions.
unknown
speaker
well
does
it
–
again,
do
you
think
that
the
department
stands
by
its
interpreted
bulletin
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the,
they
would
have
abandoned
their
interpreted
bulletin?
unknown
speaker
wrong.
unknown
speaker
seems
pretty
square
down
there.
