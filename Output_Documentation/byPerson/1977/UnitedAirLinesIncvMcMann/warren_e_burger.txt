chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-906
united
air
lines
against
mcmann.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
mr.
aikens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
when
he
first
became
employed
back
in
the
40s
that
he
did
not
go
on
to
the
plan
by
what
process
or
steps
did
he
move
to
get
on
to
the
plan,
did
he
apply
to
go
under
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
argue
that,
that
is
a
contract?
i
do
not
observe
in
your
brief
anywhere
that
you
argue
that
that
constitutes
a
contractual
undertaking
between
himself,
voluntary
contractual
undertaking
between
himself
and
united?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
contract
clause
enter
in
to
this
in
anyway?
the
subsequent
legislation
and
the
court
probably
would
have
saught
to
be
invalidated
the
contract,
if
there
was
a
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
that
is
the
position
of
the
court.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
invoke
do
you
think
the
contract
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
is
a
contract
the
statue
that
has
construed
has
some
tendency
to
inherit
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
under
review
here.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
third
circuit
took
a
different
view
on
that
point
that
the
fifth
circuit,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it
provided
10$
a
month,
that
might
cast
some
doubt
on
its
good
faith
or
it
is
just
a
subterfuge,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
get
the
arithmetic
correct.
the
full
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
is
that
he
is
getting
$850
a
month,
$450
on
the
pension
on,
400
supplemented
by
the
voluntary
contributions
of
united.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rule
of
necessity
would
take
care
of
that,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcbride
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
distinguish
between
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
language
of
the
act
in
any
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
accept
the
fourth
circuit's
characterization
of
the
plan
as
being
a
bona
fide
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
violate
the
act
in
your
view
if
the
company
refused
to
permit
a
man
41
years
old
to
begin
pilot
training
and
apply
for
pilot's
job?
if
he
had
no
previous
flying
experience.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
to
was
it
in
any
sense
a
subterfuge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
day
before
the
act
became
effective
it
was
not
a
subterfuge
you
say
because
there
was
no
yard
stick
by
which
to
measure,
let
us
say
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
it
automatically
became
a
subterfuge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
evade
the
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
said
there
is
no
difference
between
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
not
you
indicate
that
the
words,
the
purposes
are
far
redundant
and
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
it
said
the
act
or
the
chapter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
senator
javit's
remarks
some
sort
of
exposed
facto
legislative
history
of
the
earlier
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1
o'clock
and
you
have
five
minutes
left.
you
may
continue
mr.
mcbride.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
might
suggest
it
is
one
of
benevolent
neutrality.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
the
department
of
labor
had
no
barriers
to
presenting
its
views
to
this
court
and
departments
of
the
government
frequently
do.
chief
justice

burger
