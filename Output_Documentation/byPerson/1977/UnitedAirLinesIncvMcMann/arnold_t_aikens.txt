mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
petition
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
case
arises
under
the
age
discrimination
act
and
presents
a
very
narrow
issue.
that
is
whether
an
involuntary
retirement
of
a
person
under
age
65
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
pension
plan,
adopted
many
years
before
the
act
is
permissible
without
further
justification.
a
stipulation
in
this
case
has
been
entered
in
to
as
to
the
facts
and
they
maybe
very
briefly
stated.
the
respondent
mcmann
began
his
employment
with
united
air
lines
in
1944
and
during
the
course
of
his
career,
he
held
several
positions.
he
was
retired
at
the
age
of
60
in
1973
and
at
that
time
held
the
position
of
technical
specialist
aircraft
systems,
which
is
a
flight
management
position.
at
the
time,
respondent
began
his
employment
with
united.
the
united
had
a
pension
plan
in
existence,
its
membership
was
voluntary.
respondent
did
not
elect
to
join
that
plan
until
several
years
later
in
1964.
at
the
time,
he
joined
the
plan
his
application
card
indicated
that
the
normal
retirement
age
was
60
years,
thereafter
he
received
annual
reports
from
the
company
describing
the
benefits
he
had
accrued
and
on
the
face
of
each
of
these
reports
the
normal
retirement
age
was
stated
as
60.
prior
to
his
retirement
in
1973,
respondent
notified
the
secretary
of
labor
that
he
intended
to
sue
on
the
ground
that
his
retirement
violated
the
age
discrimination
act.
the
labor
department
responded
that
united's
plan
was
a
bona
fide
plan,
and
in
as
much
as
it
had
been
adopted
many,
many
years
before
the
act
that
it
did
not
appear
to
be
a
subterfuge.
respondent,
then
filed
his
action
in
the
eastern
district
of
virgina,
the
case
was
submitted
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
summary
judgment
was
granted
in
favor
of
united.
he
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit,
claiming
that
his
retirement
violated
the
discrimination
act.
united
contended
that
an
expressed
exception.
section
4(b)2,
4(f)2
expressly
provided
that
involuntary
retirement
was
authorized
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
plan
that
was
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
united
relied
upon
then
the
only
appellate
decision
brennan
v.
taft
broadcasting,
and
said
that
in
as
much
is
its
plan
had
preexisted
the
act
by
some
26
years.
that
it
therefore
could
not
be
a
subterfuge
which
was
the
holding
in
the
taft
case.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed.
the
substance
of
its
holding
was
that
any
involuntary
retirement
is
presumed
to
be
a
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
looking
to
the
history,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
the
court
said
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
condemnation
of
subterfuge,
the
employer
must
prove
that
the
retirement
related
to
either
an
economic
or
a
business
purpose
and
not
simply
age.
in
this
decision,
the
fourth
circuit
stands
alone,
the
second
,
third,
fifth
and
ninth
are
now
in
conflict.
two
sections
of
the
act
are
pertinent
to
this
case.
section
4(a)
provides
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire
or
to
discharge
any
individual
or
otherwise
discriminate
against
individual
with
respect
his
compensation,
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment
because
of
the
individual's
age.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
the
record
does
show.
it
is
revealed
in
a
system
board
decision,
professor
cox
wrote
which
indicates
that
the
normal
retirement
plan
is
followed
for
everyone
at
united.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
recognizes
the
fact
that
united
has
uniformly
applied
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
exception
within
united
airlines.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
we
do
not
think,
even
if
you
are
retired
on
one
day
and
applied
for
reemployment,
the
following
day
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
possible
under
the
act
realizing
the
act
as
to
somewhat
inconsistent
phrases
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
united
would
have
to
say
your
honor
that
the
act
does
not
ban
a
retirement
program,
that
he
has
been
retired
and
at
the
kind
of
employment
the
act
speaks
of
is
those
persons
who
have
not
been
retired
and
are
receiving
pensions.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
i
suspect
that
the
company
would,
although
this
would
inconsistent
with
its
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
his
election
to
be
in
the
pension
plan
and
the
uniform
practice
definitely.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
i
believe
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
your
honor
i
believe
each
of
the
case
involves
a
plan
in
which
the
employer
could
retain
the
employee
after
the
age
60
or
whatever
it
happened
to
be
under
the
plan.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
the
other
cases
where
involved
plans
in
which
a
retirement
was
not
mandatory
at
a
certain
age,
the
employee
could
be
retained
after
60
or
whatever
the
age
happened
to
be
if
the
employer
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct,
it
is
optional
in
the
part
of
the
company
in
most
of
those
cases.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
not
a
conflict
within
the
plan
is
there.
there
has
been
a
conflict
with
in
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
your
honor
in
1964
he
apparently
made
the
determination
to
join
the
plan
and
did
so,
it
is
a
voluntary
election
on
his
part.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
it
is
a
your
honor,
we
deem
it
to
be
a
contract,
the
retirement
plan
is
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
we
do
not
think
that
the
legislation
your
honor
has
invalidated.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
was
the
position
of
the
fourth
circuit
yes
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
we
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
the
plan
is.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
according
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
according
to
all
other
circuits,
no.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes.
a
section
4(f)2
of
the
statue
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
observe
the
terms
of
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
or
any
bona
fide
employee
benefit
plan
such
as
a
retirement,pension
or
insurance
plan
which
is
not
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act,
except
that
no
such
employee
benefit
plan
shall
excuse
the
failure
to
hire
any
individual.
three
cases
essentially
have
focused
on
this
exception.
the
first
of
this
being
the
taft
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
it
should
be
noted
and
i
think
that
while
it
is
alleged
that
the
language
of
this
provision
is
not
plain,
both
brennan
and
mcmann
have
both
stated
that
the
language
is
unambiguous,
the
problem
has
been
in
the
difficulty.
the
difficulty
with
applying
the
terms
subterfuge.
in
taft,
the
court
applied
dictionary
definitions
saying
that
the
bona
fide
plan
was
a
genuine
authentic
good
faith
plan.
it
defined
subterfuge
as
deception
by
artifice
or
stratagem
thus
applying
a
state
of
mind
concept
to
the
definition.
the
court
in
taft
held
that
since
the
plan,
it
was
involved
in
there
preceded
the
act
by
some
six
years.
it
obviously
could
not
have
been
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
united
agreed
with
the
holding
of
that
case
and
relied
upon
at
in
mcmann
in.
and
as
much
as
its
plan
was
conceded
to
be
bona
fide
paying
reasonable
benefits
and
had
existed
some
26
years
before
the
act.
the
mcmann
case
rejected
that
definition
and
presumed
any
early
retirement
or
the
retirement
before
the
age
of
65
to
be
unlawful.
it
said
that
one
must
look
to
a
reason
unrelated
to
age
to
justify
an
involuntary
retirement,
and
accordingly
the
court
said
that
that
reason
should
be
a
business
or
an
economic
reason.
the
court
said
that
this
conclusion
was
justified
by
its
review
of
the
history
and
the
history
that
it
looked
to,
was
a
single
reference
related
to
the
4f2
exception,
that
history
provided
that
this
section
of
the
act
does
apply
to
new
and
existing
plans.
that
the
exception
emphasizes
the
primary
purpose
of
the
bill
which
is
hiring
and
it
said
that
congress's
purpose
was
to
remove
plans
as
a
barrier
to
hiring
persons
within
the
protected
age
group.
the
history
that
the
court
relies
upon
is
really
limited
to
the
last
phrase
of
section
4(f)2.
this
is
sometimes
been
referred
towards
the
javits
amendment
senator
javits
was
extremely
concerned
that
corporations
would
not
hire
persons
within
the
protected
age
group
simply
because
of
the
high
cost
of
putting
them
into
pension
or
benefit
plans
for
a
very
limited
number
of
years.
he
sought
therefore
to
eliminate
that
as
a
barrier
which
of
course
that
exemption
has
done.
that
exemption
however
addresses
itself
to
another
condition
as
well
as
this.
nevertheless
it
appears
that
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
is
to
say
that
if
there
is
an
economic
factor
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
hiring
of
an
individual,
then
there
should
be
an
economic
factor
considered
with
respect
to
involuntary
retirement
and
so
the
court
imposed
that
as
a
criteria.
the
distinction
however
is
that
the
congress
imposed
the
economic
factor
with
respect
to
that
portion
of
the
exemption
covering
hiring.
it
did
not
do
so
as
to
involuntary
retirement.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
the
court
did
not
looked
beyond
that,
however
it
is
interesting
that
in
its
definition
of
bona
fide,
the
taft
case
did
consider,
not
just
a
plan
but
a
plan
that
provides
reasonable
reasonable
benefits.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yeah
,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
the
third
circuit
did
your
honor
in
the
zinger
case
and
the
third
circuit
said
that
it
would
not
look
at
the
term
subterfuge
in
terms
of
the
a
mental
concept
or
a
state
of
the
mind
concept.
it
distinguished
--
it
looked
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
it
said
that
the
act
is
primarily
aimed
at
prohibiting
discrimination
in
hiring
practices
and
in
discharging
and
that
the
act
was
intended
to
preserve
the
retirement
plan.
it
did
not
ban
them.
it
then
made
a
distinction
between
a
person
who
is
retired
and
receiving
reasonable
benefits
and
the
person
who
is
totally
discharged
or
who
is
retired
but
does
not
receive
any
benefits
and
it
said
this
is
the
subterfuge,
that
person
who
is
harmed
because
he
does
not
have
benefits
and
this
is
what
that
prohibition
is
aimed
at.
it
therefore
concluded
that
the
subterfuge
as
used
in
section
4(f)2
means
a
shame
plan
or
one
that
does
not
provide
reasonable
benefits
to
the
retire
age.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
precisely
the
court
equated
the
two.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
court-
no
court,
your
honor
to
our
knowledge
has
ever
said
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
unreasonable.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
and
the
the
statute
does
not
use
the
term
reasonable.
no
the
statute
addresses
itself
simply
to
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
it
would
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
plan
that
is
a
bona
fide
plan
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
the
united's
position
was
consistent
with
the
taft
position
that
if
it
is
bona
fide
plan
and
did
pre-exist
the
act,
then
it
would
not
be
a
subterfuge.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
right.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
a
post
act
plan
coder
could
not
be.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
some
courts
have
held
that
something
that
is
bona
fide
cannot
be
subterfuge.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
it
could
be
said
that
it
is,
if
one
were
to
look
at
subterfuge
and
define
and
not
as
or
look
to
its
application,
could
a
plan
be
genuine
but
it
could
it
have
been
put
into
effect
with
provocation
of
circumventing
something,
it
might
be
a
subterfuge.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
your
honor,
we
rely
both
upon
taft
and
say
the
taft
was
correct
as
far
as
it
went
and
we
also
rely
upon
the
zinger
case,
the
third
circuit
and
these
two
decisions
are
not
that
far
apart,
they
do
not
really
reach
different
results,
the
distinguishing
difference,
i
think
between
the
two
cases
is
that
taft
concludes
that
a
bona
fide
plan
is
one
which
provides
reasonable
benefits.
the
zinger
third
circuit
decision
uses
reasonable
benefits
to
define
the
term
subterfuge.
and
really
they
arrive
at
the
same
result
but
reasonable
benefits
is
defined
in
two
different
words.
we
believe
that
the
zinger
case
too
supports
the
position
of
our
case
and
in
that
case
the
court
looked
to
the
legislative
history.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
there
are
two
parts
to
plan
your
honor,
there
is
a
fixed
and
there
is
a
variable
part.
the
fixed
part
in
this
case
derives
from
the
contribution
of
the
employee,
however
because
this
was
a
pilot's
plan
subject
to
negotiation
and
collective
bargaining.
mr.
mcmann
only
paid
one
year
under
the
fixed
part,
united
pays
the
complete
contribution
for
the
fixed
part
of
the
portion
and
the
variable
part
he
made
contribution--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
that
is
correct.
the
sum
that
he
received
from
the
plan
is
reduced
by
two
factors.
number
one,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
for
a
very
short
time
and
then
secondly
at
the
time
of
his
retirement,
he
elected
to
accept
a
ten
year
option,
that
is
a
guaranteed
payment
for
ten
years
which
further
reduced
to
--
this
would
have
amounted
in
dollars
and
cents
to
some
thing
like
$450
in
that
area.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
united
did--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
i
do
not
know,
but
united
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
sum
was
not
a
very
high
sum
and
certainly
not
equivalent
to
one
who
would
have
been
member
of
the
plan
for
20
or
30
years,
he
made
a
voluntary
contribution
which
exceeds
what
he
gets
and
actually
the
benefits
that
he
now
receives,
they
are
approximately
$850
a
month
and
this
is
not
the
contribution
that
he
receives
of
course
he
is
not
out
of
the
pension
plan
it
is
united's
contribution
to
him.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
your
honor
we
believe
that
this
is
unique.
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstances
at
the
time
that
mr.
mcmann
joined
the
company
and
he
was
a
pilot.
it
was
membership
and
the
plan
was
by
election.
now
we
do
not
have
that
problem
because
the
pilots
are
automatically
enrolled
in
the
plan,
so
that
i
think
mr.
mcmann
is
unique
in
the
company
in
receiving
this
additional
contribution.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no,
it
was
at
the
time
of
his
retirement.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
those
figures
are
average
figures,
i
do
not
mean
to
be
specific
about
that.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
he
had.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
it
did
and
it
received
the
response
of
the
labor
department,
a
copy
of
it.
in
the
zinger
case
that
court
went
to
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
to
trace
the
history
of
this
act.
the
legislative
history
and
to
clearly
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
pension
plan
or
the
retirement
plan
in
4(f)(2)
and
that
it
did
create
an
expressed
exemption
allowing
for
involuntary
retirements
pursuant
to
that,
that
body
of
history,
the
fourth
circuit
has
for
some
reason
chosen
to
ignore,
but
the
history
briefly
stated
is
that
this
was
an
administration
bill
and
the
president
in
submitting
the
bill
to
congress
expressly
provided
for
an
exception
for
those
persons
retiring
under
pension
plans.
senator
javits'
who
was
most
active
in
the
court
before
the
committees
in
advocating
the
plan,
recognized
also
that
the
administration's
plan
which
permits
involuntary
retirement
under
a
bona
fide
plan
meets
only
part
of
the
problem
he
said,
obviously
then
he
recognized
this
is
a
valid
part
of
4(f)(2),
he
then
went
on
to
propose
his
amendment
which
is
now
the
last
phrase
of
4(f)(2).
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
in
practice
it
never
he
has
but
it
could
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
in
the
factual
context
of
our
case
it
does
not
have
to
be
dealt
with
sense
we
have
uniformly,
united
has
uniformly
applied
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
but
we
think
that
the
history
belies
this
that
congress
did
not
speak--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
would
have
to
decide
it
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
that
is
what
professor
cox
found
and
that
is
what
fourth
circuit
conceded
that
united
is
not
(inaudible)
normal
in
this
case
means
mandatory.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
yes
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
there
is
and
it
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
that
the
house
has
passed
a
bill
and
a
bill
pending
in
the
senate.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
it
does
not
have
any
bearing
on
this
case.
mr.
mcmann
of
course
is
affected
by
this
and
any
new
bill
will
not
be
retroactive.
others
who
have
been
retired
pursuant
to
involuntarily
retired,
pursuant
to
plans
are
also
affected
by
the
ruling
of
this
case.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
your
honor
no
i
do
not.
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
your
honor
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
an
error
and
it
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
court
should
follow
the
rulings
of
taft
and
zinger
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
reserve
my
time
--
mr.
arnold
t.
aikens
no
your
honor
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
gives
us
those
figures.
