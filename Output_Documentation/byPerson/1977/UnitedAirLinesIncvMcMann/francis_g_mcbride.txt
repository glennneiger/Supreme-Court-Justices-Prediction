mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
it
is
very
first
case
this
court
has
ever
considered
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
of
1967.
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
court
will
have
to
make
has
been
made
many
times
before
by
this
court
specifically
this
court
must
decide
what
the
import
of
the
language
used
by
congress
is
and
it
must
also
examine
what
congress
intended
to
do
when
it
passed
the
legislation.
the
language
of
statute
which
is
involved
particularly
section
4(f)(2)
requires
that
in
order
to
come
under
that
exception,
a
pension
plan
must
be
both
bona
fide
and
not
a
subterfuge
to
evade
purposes
of
the
act.
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
set
out
in
section
2
of
the
act.
clearly
congress
stated
them
explicitly
as
possible
they
are
to
allow
older
workers
to
obtain
and
to
retain
employment.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
i
think
the
language
of
the
act
is
clear
section
4(f)(2)
incorporates
by
reference
basically,
the
provisions
of
section
2
which
state
the
purposes.
the
purposes,
i
think
are
essential
to
this
court
consideration
of
the
question.
also
section
4(a)
of
the
act
where
the
actual
prohibitions
of
age
discrimination
are
enumerated
provides
that
there
can
be
no
discrimination
in
employment
when
sole
criteria
for
that
whatever
action
is
the
age
of
the
person
involved.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
question
down
there
was
presented
to
me,
and
i
said
i
agreed
with
them
that
it
was
bona
fide
in
the
sense
that
it
does
pay
substantial
benefits.
i
agree
generally
that
the
plan
is
bona
fide,
united's
plan
is
bona
fide,
yes.
however
the
question
before
the
court
primarily
is
whether
or
not
the
plan
is
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purpose
of
the
act.
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
be
aware
that
the
purposes
are
as
i
stated
to
let
older
workers
be
employed.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
act
itself
only
applies
between
the
ages
of
40
and
65
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct
because
he
has
been
40.
i
do
not
think
that
was
discriminating
because
of
youth,
i
do
not
think
because
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
language
does
in
fact
have
that
import
yes.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
question
your
honor.
primarily
because
of
the
necessary
extent
and
expense
of
training
someone
to
become
a
pilot.
but
in
that
case
if
that
kind
of
discriminatory
result
was
allowed,
it
would
not
be
allowed
because
the
man
was
41,
it
would
be
allowed
because
of
a
business
reason
in
other
words,
the
company
would
not
be
able
to
realistically
finance
that
kind
of
training
necessary
for
a
person
to
become
a
pilot.
so
that
would
fit
in
with
what
the
fourth
circuit
had
in
mind
when
it
said
a
business
or
economic
reason.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
that
would
not
be
bfoq
language.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
even
if
it
was,
the
faa
regulation
has
no
minimum
entry
age
but
if
it
was
within
the
scope
of
the
contract,
for
example,
if
a
contract
said
we
will
not
hire
anyone
over
the
age
of
40
to
become
a
pilot,
that
would
be
similar
to
the
present
case
and
whether
that
provision
would
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
contract,
would
become
a
question
of
whether
it
was
permissible
under
the
act.
the
act
would
have
clear
priority
over
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
definitely.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes
congress
used
both
terms
and
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
the
working
definition
that
every
court
which
has
considered
a
question
has
used
whether
or
not
that
is
a
precise--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
or
complete
is
not
really
been
a
issue.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
primary--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
reasonable
benefits.
the
primary
test
becomes
question
of
whether
or
not
the
criteria
used
is
the
criteria
which
is
prohibited
by
the
act.
in
other
words,
if
age
is
sole
reason
for
an
action
a
discriminatory
action
then
that
becomes
--.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well
yes,
it
becomes
a
subterfuge
because
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
prohibitions
of
the
act
is
against
determinations
based
solely
upon
age.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
unless
there
were
some
other
reason
yes.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
it
could
be
economic
or
business
reason
or
it
could
be
an
outside
ruling
by
the
federal
government,
such
as
if
a
person
is
a
fire
fighter
and
the
congress
decides
that
fire
fighters
should
be
exempt
from
or
involuntary
retirement
of
fire
fighter
should
be
allowed
or
even
though
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
may
not
be
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
if
there
is
this
type
of
ruling
that
would
allow
the
involuntary
retirement.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
what
should
we
say
sinister
action
type
of
definition
of
subterfuge
is
not
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
true.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
but
i
do
not
think
that
subterfuge,
the
term
subterfuge
implies
any
malicious
intent
or
any
deliberate
going
around
the
act.
in
fact,
the
result
may
be
a
subterfuge
although
the
attempt
may
not
necessarily
be
that
to
get
around
the
act
and
also
again
the
purposes
of
the
act
which
are
important
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
do
not
think,
i
can
really
answer
the
question
because
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
there
was
no
legislative
purpose
that
would
be
avoided
by
the
subterfuge.
before
the
act
was
passed,
the
plan
would
have
been
bona
fide
but
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
subterfuge
or
not,
i
do
not
believe
would
really
have
any
relevance
because
there
was
nothing
to
evade
it
to.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
i
think
the--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well
i
think
that
we
could
prevail
upon
the
terms
of
the
act
or
terms
of
the
pension
plan
itself.
the
pension
plan
states
that
the
normal
retirement
date
shall
be
the
60th
birthday
of
the
participant.
the
united
airlines
plan
which
is
involved
here,
did
have
a
provision
for
superannuated
employment
of
someone
beyond
that
normal
retirement
date.
the
fourth
circuit
in
that
reached
the
question
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question
under
the
grounds
for
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit.
they
took
a
rather
broader
approach
to
the
problem
and
therefore
did
not
get
involved
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plan
itself
would
have
been
adequate
presuming
they
had
agreed
with
united's
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
involuntarily
retire
mr
mcmann.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
with
the
retirement
age.
nothing.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
retirement
age
was
never
a
part
of
the
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well,
the
retirement
plan,
it
is
an
unusual
situation.
as
i
understand
that
only
portions
of
the
pension
plan
have
been
bargained
for.
the
original
united
airlines
pension
plan
was
established
in
1941.
at
that
time
the
retirement
date
for
pilots
was
60.
that
date
has
maintained
itself
throughout
all
of
the
alterations
to
the
plan
including
the
most
current
edition.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
it
was
partially
negotiated
with
the
union.
the
relevant
portions
of
the
plan
which
we
are
concerned
with
were
never
a
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
believe
they
probably
could
have
been
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
do
not
believe
that
any
result
would
have
come
of
that
for
several
reasons
primarily,
the
company
has
always
maintained
the
age
60
date
was
necessary
and
the
airline
pilots
association
has
never
agreed
with
that
and
i
would
think
it
highly
unlikely
that
any
meaningful
result
would
have
come
of
putting
that
on
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
so
not
think
so,
no,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
situation
that
we
have
here
now.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
statue
regardless
of
the
contract,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
with
the
preexisting
plan
question.
the
legislative
history
made
it
quite
clear
that
congress
intended
the
act
to
apply
to
both
existing
and
new
plans
and
there
are
many
decision
primarily
in
circuit
courts.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
again
it
is
a
question
of
subterfuge
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
subterfuge
can
come
into
being
when
a
plan
is
operated
so
that
age
is
the
basis
for
the
decision.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
after
the
act
then
it
becomes
the
subterfuge
to
away
the
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
in
effect
held,
right.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
purposes
of
the
act,
yes.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
the
purposes
the
act.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well
i
think
the
phrase
'purposes
of
the
act'
makes
it
much
clear
specially
in
light
of
the
way
the
act
has
been
interpreted
by
some
courts.
some
courts,
zinger
and
taft,
they
have
obviously
considered
the
act
rather
than
the
purposes.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
difference
but
and
they
said
there
it
appears
to
some
question
about
it.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes
i
do
your
honor.
i
have
several
comments
on
the
pending
legislations.
the
pending
legislations
which
has
been
approved
by
the
house
of
representatives
by
vote
of
459:4
or
359:4
specifically,
pertains
to
section
4(f)2.
the
language
of
--
one
particular
portion
of
the
language
which
is
being
added
is
that
it
adds
to
section
4(f)(2),
the
phrase
and
except
the
involuntary
retirement
of
any
employee
shall
not
be
required
or
permitted
by
any
such
seniority
system
or
any
such
employee
benefit
plan
because
of
the
age
of
the
employee.
there
has
been
considerable
legislative
history
so
far
on
these
amendments.
the
house
report
number
95-527
speaks
of
this
particular
amendment
as
being
one
to
clarify
the
act
because
of
the
varying
judicial
interpretation.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
well
if
this
was
enacted,
you
still
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
can
be
a
discrimination
not
so
much
on
involuntary
retirement
grounds
but
as
we
submit
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
now
whether
you
can
discriminate
for
example
with
regard
to
a
health
insurance
program
because
of
the
prohibitive
cost.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
okay.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
this
an
addition
to
section
4(f)(2).
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes
your
honor
and
except
that
the
involuntary
retirement
of
any
employee
shall
not
be
required
or
permitted
by
any
such
seniority
system
or
any
such
employee
benefit
plan
because
of
the
age
of
the
employee.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
think
the
discussion
during
the
original
act
made
that
clear,
your
honor
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
present
plans
and
also
that
this
would
apply
to
present
plans
as
well.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
the
senate
committee,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
this
was
the
bill
as
it
was
passed
by
the
house.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
right.
the
senate
did
add
various
and
incendiary
(ph)
exceptions
and
it
came
out
of
committee,
i
believe
last
friday.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
yes
he
is.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no,
it
would
not.
also
your
honor,
there
has
been
considerable
legislative
history
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
regarding
this
and
they
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
fourth
circuit
position
is
in
line
with
what
the
original
intent
of
congress
was.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
realize
that.
there
is
language
both
in
1967
and
in
1977.
when
dealing
with
the
1977
amendments
which
have
been
proposed,
congress
has
been
aware
of
the
varying
interpretations
of
the
provision
by
the
different
circuits
and
they
have
specifically
mentioned
in
some
cases,
in
some
instances
this
particular
case.
senator
javit's
for
example,
when
he
was
introducing
the
amendment
in
the
senate,
stated
that
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
was
to
facilitate
the
hiring
of
older
employees
by
permitting
their
employment
without
necessarily
providing
equal
benefits
under
employee
benefit
plan.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
this
is
in
1977.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
he
said
similar
things
in
1967
but
he
also
added
before
the
supreme
court
considers
the
arguments
about
what
the
congress
has
intended
by
section
4
f)(2),
i
think
it
is
incumbent
that
the
congress
made
clear
that
this
provision
was
never
intended
to
permit
the
wholesale
evasion
of
the
adea's
protections.
also
senator
williams
on
the
senate
for,
stated
that
the
new
bill,
the
1977
bill
makes
it
clear
that
the
fourth
circuit
correctly
interpreted
the
the
will
of
congress.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
not
really
your
honor,
they
are,
to
a
degree
they
are
but
they
are
very
consistent
with
what
he
said
in
1967.
they
are
more
a
re-affirmance
than
something
completely
new.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
realize
that,
i
realize
that
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
there
are
a
few
more
points
i
would
like
to
clarify
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
position
of
that
department
has
been
mentioned
by
mr.
aikens,
of
the
department
of
labor,
although
there
was
an
initial
determination
by
person
in
a
the
field,
it
has
never
been
the
official
position
of
the
department
of
labor.
in
fact
the
department
did
to
file
an
amicus
brief
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
they
have
assisted
in
the
preparation
of
my
case.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
they
have
not
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
and
their
position
has
not
changed.
i
believe
at
one
time
they
were
planning
file
an
amicus
brief
and
i
am
certain
there
would
be
happy
to
if
the
court
were
to
request
solicitor
general
to
file
one.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
realize
that
the
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
there
is
no
significance
sir.
their
position
is
the
same.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
i
would
suggest,
that
they
are
actively
in
our
behalf,
in
fact
to
a
large
extent,
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
was
based
on
their
amicus
brief.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
on
the
either
ground
yes
sir
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
the
published
interpreted
bulletins
have
never
been
withdrawn.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
they
are
not.
what
the
interpreted
bulletin
does
is
it
incorporates
by
reference
or
requirements
of
section
4(f)2.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
is
correct
your
honor.
basically
the
position
of
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
with
respect
to
you
the
requirements
with
respect
to
there
being
some
other
outside
requirement.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
as
the
matter
of
fact,
during
the
original
hearings
on
the
1967
although
united
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
quoted
secretary
of
labor
works.
he
also
stated
in
the
house
hearings
that
the
bill
does
recognize
on
the
one
hand,
his
plans
specifically
recognizes
those
plans
that
are
worked
out
for
rational
reasons
so
long
as
they
do
not
result
in
differentiation
just
on
the
basis
of
age
itself.
where
there
is
no
justification
in
fact.
which
is
precisely
a
situations
which
we
have
here.
the
legislative
history
which
has
been
presented
to
the
court
is
not
complete
and
i
would
urge
that
the
court
study
the
legislative
history
in
its
entirety.
the
position
of
the
department
as
indicated
by
the
remark,
i
just
quoted
by
a
secretary
wirtz
has
always
been
that
there
must
be
something
other
than
just
age,
and
they
have
not
changed
this
position.
the
one
other
factual
thing
which
i
think
that
should
clear
up.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
am
not
certain
of
that
i
think
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
no
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
vague
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
that
may
be
i
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
really
could
not
say.
i
believe
that
they
would
urge
that
the
decision
be
affirmed
on
the
alternate
ground
and
i
really
cannot
speak
with
certainly
about
the
position
of
the
department.
i
am
at
particular
aspect
of
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
do
not
think
that
they
necessarily
would
have
been
abandoned
it,
i
think
that
they
probably
would
take
the
position
that
it
was
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
not
wrong,
not
artfully
done
for
the
first
time
around
and
that
--
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
if
they
had
another
chance
at
it
they
would
perhaps
used
different
language.
mr.
francis
g.
mcbride
i
am
aware
that
your
honor
i
think
the,
they
did
not
in
fact
plan
do
it
but
there
was
a
--
i
understand
the
time
problem
in
the
solicitors
general's
office
which
was
a
reason
for
it
not
being
filed.
