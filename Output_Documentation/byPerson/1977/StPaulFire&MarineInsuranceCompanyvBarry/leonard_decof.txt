mr.
leonard
decof
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
this
case
seems
to
revolve
about
a
very
finite
and
very
limited
issue
that
is
the
construction
of
section
3(b)
of
mccarran-ferguson
act.
but
as
it
evolved,
the
position
of
the
petitioners
shifted
from
one
point
to
another.
and
i
say
this
not
in
a
pejorative
way
but
i
think
to
give
the
context
and
the
history
of
the
case
to
the
court
and
to
illustrate
the
weakness
of
the
various
positions
that
the
petitioners
have
retreated
to,
it
would
cast
some
light
on
the
witness
of
their
present
position.
first,
the
case
was
brought
in
the
district
court
of
rhode
island
and
the
case
was
dismissed
upon
petitioner’s
motion
based
on
the
so-called
black
listing
limitation
which
petitioner’s
described
to
3(b)
of
mccarran-ferguson.
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
very
same
limitation
was
urged.
now,
petitioner’s
pointed
to
one
thing
in
the
congressional
record,
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
their
argument
for
blacklisting
and
that
was
a
statement
of
congressman
seller
which
merely
cited
blacklisting
as
an
example,
when
he
said
for
example,
will
3(b)
prevent
blacklisting?
but
at
least
at
that
point,
petitioners
were
pointing
to
something
in
the
legislative
history
which
could
support
their
position.
at
the
present
stage,
since
proctor
and
by
the
way
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
which
have
taken
the
same
position
as
proctor,
i
think
their
case
is
now
in
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth
circuits.
part
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
battle
case
and
the
dc
circuit
which
is
proctor.
they
now
take
the
position
that
well,
we
do
not
ask
that
the
limitation
of
3(b)
be
narrowed
to
blacklisting
but
we
say
it
should
be
narrowed
to
include
all
traders.
in
implicit
in
their
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
it
must
exclude
consumers.
now,
petitioners
in
the
replied
brief
on
page
three,
state
in
the
second
paragraph,
“the
only
issue
here
now
is
to
draw
the
line
between
boycotts
and
other
combinations
and
conspiracies
in
restrain
of
trade
covered
by
the
sherman
act,
so
as
to
give
meaning
to
the
expressed
exemption
of
2(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.”
petitioners
are
now
asking
this
court
to
go
outside
3(b),
outside
mccarran-ferguson
and
give
a
definition
of
a
boycott
under
the
sherman
act.
the
sherman
act
itself
which
will
fit
into
their
description
and
thereby
exclude
petitioners.
and
they
set
forth
this
proposed
definition
in
the
alternative.
the
first
prong
of
their
definition,
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
we
challenge
this
from
the
very
outset.
when
the
action
was
brought
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioner’s
then
defendants
move
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
mccarran-ferguson.
we
replied,
plaintiffs
replied
that
there
was
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation
alleged
and
therefore
we
came
within
the
3(b)
exclusion.
petitioners,
then
defendants
rejoined
by
stating
that
yes
but
that
was
limited
to
blacklisting
under
mccarran-ferguson.
mr.
leonard
decof
issue
at
that
time
was
joined
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
boycott
in
3(b)
and
that
issue
was
argued
before
the
first
circuit.
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
if
the
court
please,
our
position
is
that
the
petitioners
have
shifted
from
this
because
of
the
state,
originally
their
argument
was
bottomed
on
the
assertion
that
boycott
under
3(b)
had
a
different
meaning
than
boycott
under
the
sherman
act.
now,
they
state
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
problem
here
is
to
define
the
limits
of
boycott
under
the
sherman
act.
so,
that
the
deduction
there
is
that
leads
us
to
the
conclusion,
they
now
agree
that
boycott
under
the
sherman
act
is
the
same
as
boycott
under
3(b).
if
they
come
to
that
position,
then
they
must
take
the
position
that
congress
in
enacting
3(b)
meant
to
do
something
which
was
not
just
an
illusion
and
did
not
mean
to
give
with
one
hand
and
take
away
by
the
other.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
get
down
to
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
'boycott'
in
3(b)
but
which
is
now,
i
believe
by
petitioner’s
position
correlated
to
the
meaning
of
boycott
under
sherman,
and
i
think
the
position
before
this
court
is
that
the
meaning
of
boycott
is
limited.
but
it
is
limited
not
because
of
3(b)
but
because
of
its
meaning
under
sherman
should
be
limited.
mr.
leonard
decof
our
position
of
the
court
please
is
that
if
you
apply,
--first
of
all,
our
first
position
is
that
even
under
the
definition
that
petitioners
propose,
the
respondents
here
have
standing
and
fall
within
that
definition
within
the
second
form
of
their
definition.
our
second
position
is
that
the
definition
is
unduly
restrictive
and
unduly
limiting
because
by
its
very
nature,
it
excludes
all
consumers
as
victims
of
boycott.
it
injects
into
the
definition
of
boycott
intent
which
this
court
has
said
on
many,
many
occasions
is
not
a
consideration
in
the
definition
of
boycott.
the
court
has
said
that
the
effect
is
a
consideration
but
that
the
intent
is
immaterial.
they
have
said
this
in
silver.
they
have
said
it
in
frankfort
distilleries
and
many
other
cases
if
the
court
please.
so,
we
take
the
position
first
that
the
simple
answer
to
their
proposed
definition
is
we
do
not
fall
within
or
outside
the
limitations.
the
first
prong
of
their
definition
is
that
there
must
be
a
competitor
of
the
victim
as
one
of
the
conspirators.
as
i
stated
it
was
couched
in
the
alternative
in
the
second
prong
they
state
that
the
boycott
must
be
an
act
which
is
directed
to
control
the
competitive
activities
of
the
victim.
now,
the
act
we
fit
within
the
second
definition,
if
the
court
please,
because
the
act
of
boycott
in
this
case
controlled
the
commercial
activities
of
the
victims
that
is
the
doctors
and
i
think
since
the
petitioners
have
raised
the
question
of
the
joint
underwriting
authority,
i
must
put
that
into
context
as
background
to
get
into
this.
this
was
not
a
raise
if
the
court
please.
there
was
a
medical
malpractice
crisis
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
but
the
crisis
was
ignited
by
this
situation
where
almost
half
the
doctors,
more
than
half
the
doctors
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
were
insured
by
st.
paul.
most
of
their
policies
were
going
to
expire
on
june
30,
1975.
in
april,
st.
paul
announced
that
their
policies
would
not
be
renewed
except
on
a
claims-made
basis.
and
i
must
touch
on
the
nature
of
the
claims-made
policy
to
illustrate
what
this
meant.
the
claims-made
policy
would
ensure
the
doctor
only
in
the
year
in
which
the
policy
was
in
effect
and
if
the
doctor
had
been
insured
by
the
same
company
in
the
year
in
which
the
occurrence
took
place.
now
the
doctor’s
position
was
that
these
locked
them
in
for
life
with
the
company
because
once
the
first
claims-made
policy
was
issued,
the
doctors
must
stay
with
that
company.
if
they
decided
for
example,
to
change
jurisdictions
and
move
to
a
state
in
which
for
example
st.
paul
did
not
sell
medical
malpractice
insurance,
they
would
have
to
have
double
coverage
for
this
reason.
since
the
claims-made
policy
insured
them
only
for
one
year
over
the
time,
if
they
should
retire,
or
if
they
should
die,
or
if
they
should
leave
the
company,
they
would
have
to
buy
coverage
for
any
actions
which
might
be
brought
against
them
in
later
years.
whether
because,
the
statute
had
not
expired,
whether
because
there
was
a
discoverability
type
action
for
whatever
reason.
and
this
coverage
could
be
afforded
to
them
by
means
of
a
so-called
three
reporting
endorsements.
they
had
to
be
bought
in
three
installments.
and
so,
if
a
doctor
wanted
to
leave
the
jurisdiction
of
rhode
island,
once
he
had
assigned
up
with
st.
paul
on
a
claims-made
basis,
he
would
have
to
buy
three
reporting
endorsements
which
would
cover
him
for
any
actions
that
were
brought
after
the
year
in
which
he
left
because
he
had
been
insured
in
the
base
year.
now,
if
he
went
to
another
state,
he
would
have
to
have
double
coverage.
and
the
cost
of
these
reporting
endorsements
would
have
come
to
about
a
150%.
and
so
the
pernicious
features
of
this
plan
and
it
was
an
ingenious
plan,
was
that
the
doctor
was
locked
in,
he
could
not
leave
the
state,
he
could
not
retire
from
the
practice.
if
he
died,
his
wife
or
his
heirs
would
have
30
days
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
would
buy
the
reporting
endorsements
which
would
cover
actions
which
were
brought
afterward.
mr.
leonard
decof
if
the
court
please,
i
will
respond
to
that
although
we
are
not
in
that
situation
here.
i
think
in
that
situation,
this
court
or
the
federal
court
would
have
the
right
to
look
at
factual
situation
to
see
if
it
did
in
fact
constitute
a
boycott,
in
the
first
instance.
now,
the
defendant’s
position
is
that
this
court
should
be
frozen
to
the
definition
of
boycott
which
had
been
established
in
previous
cases
because
of
the
fact
situations
in
those
cases.
in
many
instances,
the
court
has
looked
to
the
facts.
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
applied
the
rule
of
reason,
though
it
decided
originally
in
northern
pacific
railway
case
that
if
the
activity
was
pernicious
and
had
no
redeeming
virtues,
it
was
a
boycott.
now,
we
cannot
say,
now,
i
do
not
think
the
court
would
be
willing
to
say
now,
no
but
everything
outside
those
circumscribed
fact
situations
is
not
a
boycott.
and
the
situation,
your
honor
proposes,
it
would
be
a
fact
situation
on
which
the
court
could
decide
whether
or
not
this
was
a
boycott
and
if
it
was
a
boycott,
then
it
came
within
the
protection
of
3(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
but
we
are
not
at
that
question
at
the
moment.
my
definition
of
a
boycott
if
the
court
cares
to
hear,
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
go
this
far.
we
are
saying
that
what
happened
here
was
a
classic
boycott.
it
was
a
denial
of
75
percent
of
the
insurance
market
to
the
doctors.
and
we
are
saying
that
we
fit
within
the
second
category
of
the
petitioner’s
definition
because
we
are
traders.
in
our
society,
the
doctors
cannot
practice
their
profession
without
medical
malpractice
insurance.
this
is
the
same
to
them
as
buying
a
scalpel
or
stethoscope.
and
this
is
what
propelled
rhode
island
into
the
medical
malpractice
crisis.
the
jua
was
formed
as
a
result
of
this
set
of
facts.
it
was
not
something
that
was
boiling
in
the
pot
while
this
action
was
taking
place.
the
jua
resulted
from
this
set
of
facts
and
the
jua
is
a
creature
of
emergency.
it
was
promulgated
by
the
director
of
business
regulation
of
the
state
of
rhode
island,
because
the
situation
was
that
the
doctors
had
asked
the
state
to
put
in
freezing
legislation
so
that
the
matter
could
be
looked
into
and
the
insurance
companies
have
threatened
to
pull
out
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
if
the
freezing
legislation
was
put
in
and
so
the
jua
which
is
really
inimical
to
the
idea
of
free
enterprise
because
the
way
the
jua
was
set
up.
all
companies
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
had
to
belong
to
a
risk
pool
and
this
was
a
condition
of
their
doing
business
in
the
state.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
the
companies
both
surfacely
complained
about
the
jua.
they
rebelled
against
it.
and
it
is
an
emergency
type
of
legislation,
a
police
state
type
of
thing.
the
state
of
rhode
island
certainly
does
not
want
to
be
in
the
insurance
business.
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
happen.
or
if
the
balance
were
restored,
there
would
not
be
any
for
jua.
but
again,
the
simple
answer
to
the
question
of
the
jua
is
it
is
immaterial
here
because
when
this
action
was
brought,
there
was
no
jua.
mr.
leonard
decof
there
are
a
number
of
states
in
the
country
if
the
court
pleases
to
my
knowledge
in
which
the
st.
paul
does
not
do
business.
there
are
only
four
companies
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
which
sell
medical
malpractice
insurance.
throughout
the
united
states,
again
there
is
something
that
never
has
been
gotten
into,
i
think
because
of
mccarran-ferguson,
there
seems
to
be
a
territorial
allocation
in
which
certain
companies
deal
in
certain
states.
in
my
opinion
and
i
am
very
familiar
with
the
malpractice
seen
in
the
state
of
rhode
island,
i
was
on
the
governor’s
commission
which
ended
up
enacting
the
new
legislation.
the
claims
experienced
in
state
of
rhode
island
to
my
knowledge
has
been
an
excellent
one
and
i
wonder
why
have
there
not
been
other
companies
beside
these
four
petitioners
but
my
answer
to
you
on
this
question
sir,
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states
where
st.
paul
does
not
sell
medical
malpractice
insurance.
by
the
same
token,
companies
like
argonaut
which
deal
heavily
in
malpractice
insurance
are
not
in
the
state
of
rhode
island.
now,
we
say
if
the
court
please
that
the
definition
of
boycott
even
if
you
limit
it
is
a
conceited
refusal
to
deal
which
has
that
as
its
effect
a
restrain
on
commerce
or
restrain
on
trade.
purpose
has
been
counted
immaterial
as
i
stated
before
in
many
cases
by
this
court.
and
the
effect
of
this
boycott,
the
only
boycott
before
this
court
is
where
the
companies
refused
absolutely
to
sell
insurance
of
any
kind
to
the
doctors
who
were
insured
by
st.
paul.
a
classic
boycott
and
the
only
way
that
this
could
be
remove
from
that
definition
is
to
say
a
consumer
cannot
be
the
victim
of
a
boycott.
this
leads
us
to
the
anomalous
conclusion
that
a
consumer
who
is
protected
under
the
sherman
act,
this
is
square
one
law
and
the
petitioners
concede
this,
maybe
protected
against
an
act
which
harms
him
by
virtue
of
an
indirect
boycott
but
cannot
be
protected
from
the
identical
harm
when
it
is
aimed
directly
at
him.
chief
justice,
using
the
appellation
case
stated
that
the
sherman
act
deals
in
substance
and
we
are
here
dealing
with
substance.
and
this
is
why
i
am
urging
to
this
court
that
we
have
a
very
great
issue
here.
petitioners
are
asking
that
the
court
examine
boycott,
the
definition
of
boycott,
and
pronounce
a
definition
which
will
exclude
consumers
from
its
protection
either
because
they
are
not
competitors
of
the
boycotter
or
because
they
are
not
engaged
in
some
competing
business
with
the
boycotter.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor
but
the
legislators
in
adapting
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
we
submit
intended
boycott
to
have
the
same
meaning
that
it
had
in
the
sherman
act.
we
answer
the
emasculation
argument
this
way.
first
of
all
to
petitioner’s
contention
that
almost
anything
could
be
defined
in
terms
of
a
boycott,
the
court
many
times
has
distinguished
between
the
act
or
agreement
for
example,
price
fixing
and
the
consorted
activity
to
carry
it
out.
there
are
many
proscribe
actions
on
the
sherman
which
are
not
boycotts.
for
example,
a
conspiracy
to
crash
a
competitor,
this
could
be
carried
out
without
a
boycott
in
any
number
of
ways
by
stealing
trade
secrets,
by
stealing
employees,
by
false
advertising,
and
so
forth.
tying
agreements
need
not
be
enforced
by
a
boycott.
the
entire
section
2
on
monopolies
that
is
not
boycott,
so,
even
if
you
gave
the
fullest
range
to
the
meaning
of
boycott
under
mccarran-ferguson
and
therefore
insured
the
protection
that
sherman
guaranteed
to
the
public,
there
is
still
a
vast
area
of
installation
for
the
insurance
companies
reserved
by
mccarran-ferguson.
beside
this,
mccarran-ferguson
insulated
the
insurance
companies
against
any
actions
brought
under
the
other
anti-trust
act,
the
clayton
act,
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
the
robinson-patman
act.
this
again
is
a
vast
area
of
protection.
finally,
the
insurance
companies
were
insulated
by
mccarran-ferguson
against
any
action
brought
by
any
other
federal
under
any
other
federal
legislation
that
did
not
relate
directly
to
insurance.
and
so,
with
reference
to
the
emasculation
argument,
i
believe
it
is
an
artificial
argument.
there
is
a
great
area
of
protection
still
reserved
to
the
insurance
companies.
with
reference
to
the
definition
of
boycott,
if
we
put
that
aside,
there
have
been
allegations
of
coercion
and
intimidation
here.
and
the
legislators
made
a
claim
that
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation
were
not
the
same
things.
as
a
matter
of
fact
senator
o’mahoney
said,
“we
are
talking
about
six
things
here
that
the
state
does
not
have
power
to
regulate,
boycott,
coercion,
intimidation,
or
the
agreement
to
do
any
of
these
things.
so,
that
again
is
an
issue
that
transcends
the
issue
of
the
boycott.
now,
petitioners
have
relied
greatly
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
their
time
in
their
briefs
and
in
their
arguments
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
state
regulation
and
whether
or
not
we
have
an
area
of
state
regulation.
we
do
not
deny
this
and
never
have.
respondents’
position
is
not
that
state
of
rhode
island
is
not
engaged
in
the
regulation
of
insurance.
however,
the
fact
that
they
are
engaged
and
the
regulation
of
insurance
do
not
permit
them
to
authorize
acts
of
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
this
has
been
specifically
carved
out
of
that
protection
and
this
court
has
not
been
reluctant
to
look
at
mccarran-ferguson
cases
and
for
example
in
the
scc
versus
variable
annuities,
the
court
determined
what
the
scope
of
insurance
was.
there
was
no
question
there
was
regulation
of
insurance
but
in
that
case,
the
court
determined
a
variable
annuity
policy
was
not
within
the
scope
of
the
business
of
insurance
in
ftc
versus
travelers.
the
court
determined
the
scope
of
state
regulation.
and
again,
in
that
situation
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
travelers
are
selling
these
policies
outside
of
state
by
mail
although
it
had
an
act
which
purported
to
regulate
these
things,
what
was
the
extent
and
what
was
the
limit
of
that
regulation?
in
a
most
important
case,
the
frankfort
distillery
case
was
not
a
mccarran
case
but
it
was
a
miller-tydings
act
case.
in
the
frankfort
distillery
case,
the
state
of
colorado
had
a
fair
trade
practices
act
which
allowed
the
fixing
of
prices.
and
the
miller-tydings
act
gave
them
the
right
to
do
this
so
they
were
regulating
in
this
area.
there
was
a
boycott
involved
in
enforcing,
fixing
of
prices
and
the
state
said
that
even
though
they
are
permitted
by
the
provisions
of
miller-tydings
to
fix
prices
and
even
though
they
are
permitted
by
the
21st
amendment
to
do
this
that
still
in
all
that
did
not
permit
them
to
engage
in
activities
of
boycott,
coercion,
or
intimidation
which
would
be
beyond
the
scrutiny
of
the
federal
courts.
again,
the
third
case,
i
wanted
to
cite
with
reference
to
mccarran-ferguson
was
sec
v.
national
securities
in
which
the
court
determined
what
was
an
insurance
policy
and
this
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
prosecution
by
the
sec
against
the
defendant
company
for
misstatements
and
misrepresentations
made
to
stockholders
of
a
company
which
it
was
going
to
merge
with.
and
there
was
a
law
that
the
director
of
insurance
in
the
state
had
to
approve
any
merges.
now,
the
sec
first
brought
an
action
for
injunction
and
this
was
denied
because
the
insurance
--
it
was
held
to
be
insurance
and
regulated
by
the
state
and
the
merger
went
through
and
the
sec
then
brought
an
action
to
unwind
the
merger.
and
this
court
said
even
though
it
was
the
insurance
director’s
obligation
to
approve
the
merger
and
even
though
he
did
approve
the
merger,
he
did
not
say
to
these
people,
you
must
merge,
all
he
said
was
you
can
and
i
find
it
to
be
adequate.
but
the
court
held
also
that
this
could
be
reviewed
and
that
mccarran-ferguson
did
not
insulate
the
state
from
the
action.
now,
this
case
is
not
even
a
strong
on
its
fact
as
the
barry
case
because
in
the
sec
v.
national
securities
case,
the
state
had
passed
legislation
authorizing
and
directing
the
director
of
insurance
to
approve
such
a
merger
and
he
had
acted
and
had
done
it.
in
the
barry
case,
there
has
never
been
any
action
by
the
state
of
rhode
island
to
authorize
the
act
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
that
petitioner’s
will
concede
this,
there
could
not
be
if
the
state
of
rhode
island
did
say
we
authorize
boycott,
coercion,
or
intimidation
to
enforce
this
price
fixing,
this
will
be
a
nullity.
mr.
leonard
decof
if
the
court
please,
my
position
would
be
and
i
hope
that
it
is
not
a
quibbling
one
that
this
would
present
a
new
set
of
facts
which
should
be
looked
at
to
see
whether
or
not
they
are
so
open
issues
and
so
without
redeeming
virtues
that
they
would
be
a
boycott.
i
do
not
if
this
court
is
ready
--
mr.
leonard
decof
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
in
my
opinion,
if
the
court
please,
i
say
in
this
case
you
do
not
have
to
but
if
the
court
wants
to
circumscribe
or
define
the
limits
of
boycott,
i
would
say
a
boycott
would
be
a
considerable
refusal
to
deal
which
deprives
the
victim
of
the
freedom
of
choice
in
a
market.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
again,
the
court
does
not
have
to
go
to
these
extremes.
mr.
leonard
decof
exactly.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
i
have
in
mind
if
the
court
please,
the
shuen
case
and
its
subsequent
overruling
by
gte
sylvania
where
we
had
vertical
territorial
allocations
and
the
court
in
the
gte
sylvania
said
we
will
apply
a
rule
of
reason.
the
court
said
at
the
same
time,
we
are
not
saying
that
a
vertical
restriction
cannot
be
a
per
se
violation.
we
will
apply
rule
of
reason.
and
i
would
not
take
issue
with
applying
the
rule
of
reason.
i
would
say
in
this
case,
a
rule
of
reason
could
be
applied.
there
have
been
some
lower
court
cases
like
mackey
versus
the
nfl,
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
rozelle
rule
was
a
boycott
but
applied
a
rule
of
reason.
i
only
say
that
this
court
has
not
yet
taken
that
step
and
i
can
understand
the
court’s
reason
for
the
per
se
rule.
i
think
there
are
excellent
reasons
for
it
to
have
a
bright
line
so
that
business
and
the
court
can
conduct
themselves
by
some
standing
in
an
area
that
is
at
best
very
murky
but
i
do
on
take
the
position
that
we
have
to
rigidly
freeze
a
definition
into
which
all
sets
of
facts
which
come
here
after
must
fit
or
must
be
rejected
if
not
a
boycott.
and
it
may
be
that
the
rule
of
reason
would
be
the
answer
in
the
case
such
as
your
honors.
i
know
the
court
after
shuen
was
very
much
bothered
because
in
the
white
motors
case,
the
court
had
said
that,
“we
are
unfamiliar
with
this
area;
we
have
to
know
a
lot
more
about
it
before
we
decide.”
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
per
se
violation
and
the
rule
of
reason
get
us
into
a
circular
argument
and
semantics,
which
i
noticed
earlier
in
the
research
in
this
case.
at
some
time,
the
court
applies
a
rule
of
reason
to
describe
what
a
boycott
was,
that
was
at
level
one.
maybe,
now
only
certain
things
are
boycott
and
we
get
into
an
exercise
as
to
whether
something
is
a
boycott
and
you
may
undo
the
pernicious
nature
of
it
by
applying
a
rule
of
reason
at
the
second
step.
well,
whether
or
not
you
say
something
when
you
determine
that
something
is
a
boycott,
the
court
in
the
first
instance
apply
the
rule
of
reason
and
said
because
of
these
facts,
we
have
a
boycott.
to
me,
it
is
immaterial
that
which
step
you
apply,
the
rule
of
reason
or
what
i
am
saying
is
that
we
maybe,
because
of
changing
times
launched
into
a
situation
where
a
set
of
facts
occurs
and
this
is
as
good
an
example.
i
think
this
is
a
new
creature,
this
claims-made
policy
an
ingenious
device.
a
set
of
fact
occurs
which
was
not
anticipated
originally.
and
then
i
say
maybe
the
court
is
in
the
position
without
abandoning
the
per
se
rule
of
saying
we
are
back
where
we
were
when
we
decided
fact
situation
a,
b,
and
c
was
a
boycott
but
this
is
new
fact
situation
so
let
us
look
at
it,
see
if
it
has
any
redeeming
virtues,
see
what
the
pernicious
effect
is,
and
in
accordance
with
northern
pacific
decide
whether
this
is
a
boycott.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
decof
just
a
brief
marker.
your
honor,
we
have
come
along
way
from
what
judge
coffin
said
was
the
plain
meaning
of
boycott
because
one
of
the
questions
that
justice
stevens
asked
was
whether
a
market
allocation
is
a
boycott.
under
the
solicitor
general’s
definition,
a
market
allocation
which
this
court
in
topco
and
sealy(ph)
and
in
other
cases
treated
as
a
market
allocation
and
a
per
se
violation,
antitrust
which
becomes
a
boycott
so
much
for
the
plain
meaning.
i
also
would
like
to
add
that
we
now
have
a
situation
where
conduct
which
is
economically
indistinguishable
is
treated
as
a
boycott
and
while
i
suggested
that
we
have
come
to
an
artificial
reading,
in
fact,
i
believe
the
government’s
position
and
the
respondent’s
position
is
most
artificial
because
the
examples
we
have
had
of
where
you
have
four
people,
four
companies,
i
think
my
correspondents
here
would
like
to
get
out
because
apparently,
they
are
not
part
of
the
boycott,
you
have
for
companies
here.
one
of
them
is
going
to
sell
claims-made
and
three
do
not
want
to
sell,
occurrence
is
that
they
do
not
want
to
sell
anything
so
they
have
to
try
claims-made.
now,
if
all
four
had
agreed
to
sell
only
claims-made,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
that
is
not
a
boycott
but
the
other
is.
i
say
that
there
is
no
logical
distinction.
i
would
like
to
just
go
back
to
our
position
as
to
why
there
is
a
sound
and
logical
dividing
line
between
what
we
say
is
a
boycott
and
what
we
say
is
covered
by
3
(b)
exemption.
under
our
definition,
a
boycott
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
used
it
in
the
past
situations
where
although
the
competitors
or
group
of
conspirators
agree
among
themselves
that
they
will
not
sell
except
at
a
fixed
price
or
fixed
terms.
they
do
more.
they
prevent
the
fellow
who
does
want
to
sell
at
a
different
price
from
coming
in.
they
decide
in
senator
o’mahoney’s
words,
engaged
in
private
regulation.
they
are
going
to
punish
that
fellow
in
a
variety
of
ways.
in
the
south-eastern-underwriters
case,
as
mr.
friedman
correctly
points
out
they
punished
that
fellow
by
cutting
off
the
consumer.
but
it
was
not
just
the
consorted
refusal
deal
with
the
consumer.
it
was
a
consorted
refusal
to
deal
with
consumer
who
had
to
marry
the
deal
with
the
price-cutter.
that
is
what
south-eastern
underwriters
called
a
boycott.
that
is
what
this
legislative
history
is
all
about.
that
is
where
congress
drew
the
line.
they
said
if
insurance
companies
agreed
--
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
i
have
in
this
respect.
mr.
leonard
decof
very
clear
your
honor,
i
think
judge
mcallen
opened
my
eyes
to
something
that
i
have
not
seen
before.
and
that
was
this,
my
definition
of
a
boycott
in
most
cases
would
be
very
much
like
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
definitions
which
limited
to
insurance
agents
and
insurance
companies
because
in
most
cases,
as
in
south-eastern
underwriters,
my
description
and
this
court’s
definition
in
the
use
of
a
boycott
in
past
cases,
in
the
insurance
business,
typically
the
fellow
who
is
going
to
be
boycotted
or
pressured
not
to
compete
is
a
competing
agent
or
a
competing
insurance
company.
i
realize
that
reading
proctor,
that
that
is
not
always
the
case
that
you
can
reach
out
into
another
business
which
is
what
happened
in
proctor
and
do
the
same
thing
they
did
in
south-eastern
underwriters.
now
judge
mcallen’s
opinion
in
my
view,
as
i
read
it
says
exactly
what
we
are
saying
that
he
says
--
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
your
honor,
that
would
be
in
agreement
to
fix
the
terms
of
a
product
which
is
a
--
.
mr.
leonard
decof
they
will
not
insure
that
category
of
risk.
mr.
leonard
decof
that
would
be
in
agreement
not
to
compete.
mr.
leonard
decof
it
would
not
be
a
boycott
in
my
view.
your
honor,
i
think
i
am
through
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
thank
you.
