but
what
if
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
are
putting
the
pressure
on
is
because
some
of
the
companies
are
doing
business
with
certain
kinds
of
customers?
that
the
boycotters
or
the
pressure
requires
that
they
will
think
that
should
be
served,
that
those
rates
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
applying
in
both,
here
are
five
companies
that
get
together
and
say
“we
do
not
like
this
six
company
doing
business
with
that
class
of
customer
at
those
rates
so
we
are
going
to
boycott
them
both.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
customer
would
have
a
course
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
boycotted
company
and
the
customer
both
sue,
can
they
both
stand
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
whether
the
mccarran
act
bars
the
suit
by
the
customer
in
that
case,
is
it
not?
