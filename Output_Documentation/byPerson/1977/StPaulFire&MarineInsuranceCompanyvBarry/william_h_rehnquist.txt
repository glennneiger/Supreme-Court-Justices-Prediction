justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
practices
of
the
rhode
island
insurance
commission
with
respect
to
approval
or
disapproval
of
policy
conditions
that
may
be
filed
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
the
state
of
rhode
island
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
could
simply
say
we
are
going
to
have
total
free
enterprise
and
insurance
in
rhode
island.
and
so
there
would
be
no
need
for
state
regulation
and
that
would
be
sufficient
to
exempt
it
from
the
anti-trust
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
distinguish
the
fact
that
there
is
a
total
refusal
by
the
three?
