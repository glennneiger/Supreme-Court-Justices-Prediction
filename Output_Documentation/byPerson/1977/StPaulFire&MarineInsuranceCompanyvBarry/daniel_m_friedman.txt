mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
a
boycott
under
section
3(b)
of
mccarran-ferguson
means
a
consorted
refusal
to
deal
when
people
get
together
and
refuse
to
deal
with
someone.
a
situation
which
means
that
the
victim
of
the
boycott
finds
himself
excluded
from
the
section
of
the
market
which
is
represented
by
the
people
who
are
combining
in
this
endeavor
to
exclude
him.
and
that
is
we
think
precisely
what
is
alleged
in
this
case.
the
charge
in
this
case
is
that
the
three
insurance
companies
other
than
st.
paul
even
refused
to
entertain
applications
for
insurance
from
any
of
the
doctors,
hospitals,
and
other
medical
personnel
whom
st.
paul
represented.t
his
is
not
a
charge
that
the
insurance
companies
refuse
to
deal
with
these
customers
except
on
particular
terms
and
conditions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
think
probably
not
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
would
have
to
vary
from
case
to
case.
it
would
depend
on
what
it
was.
it
is
possible
of
course
with
the
particular
terms
and
condition
were
so
unreasonable
that
is
a
practical
data,
it
constituted
a
refusal
to
deal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
mean
unreasonable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
that
is
how
this
court
has
treated
boycott
and
its
decisions
under
the
anti-trust
laws
and
this
of
course
is
one
of
the
main
points
that
petitioners
make
here.
they
say
the
problem
with
defining
boycott
as
the
respondents
and
the
government
defines
it,
is
that
everything
virtually
that
involves
joint
action
can
be
framed
as
a
boycott,
and
that
is
we
think
that
is
not
how
we
think
boycott
has
been
defined.
they
give
their
precise
example,
they
said
well,
an
agreement
to
fix
prices
could
be
phrased
as
an
agreement
not
to
sell
except
upon
those
prices
and
therefore
you
could
describe
this
as
a
boycott
and
if
that
is
what
boycott
means,
it
has
its
open-ended
meaning.
it
would
come
close
to
swallowing
up
the
entire
mccarran-ferguson
act
provision
giving
the
states
broad
discretion
to
regulate
insurance.
that
is
not
what
we
think
boycott
means
and
that
is
not
how
we
think
this
court
has
defined
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
that
st.
paul
may
have
been
a
party
to
the
illegal
understanding
that
the
other
three
would
not.
but
i
would
think
st.
paul’s
--
i
would
be
put
it
this
way.
i
would
think
that
st.
paul
is
standing
alone.
its
refusal
to
sell
except
on
a
claims-made
basis,
i
would
not
think
that
standing
alone
is
a
boycott.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
the
essence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
they
consorted
out
that
is
why
i
try
to
suggest
that
you
may
have
a
boycott,
st.
paul
may
be
participating
in
the
illegal
boycott
with
the
other
three.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
four
of
them
have
agreed
that
the
three
will
refuse
to
sell
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suggested
that
it
requires
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
people
to
allow
the
customers
into
that
segment
of
the
market.
in
other
words
the
illegal
restraint
is
that
they
have
refused
to
permit
the
doctor’s
access
to
the
portion
of
the
medical
malpractice
insurance
market
represented
by
the
other
three
which
is
something
like
40
or
50
percent
of
the
rhode
island
market.
that
is
the
essence,
your
honor
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
i
think
traditionally,
the
concept
of
boycott
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
the
end
anti-trust
field
to
deal
with
a
situation
where
a
group
of
competitors
get
together
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
of
those
who
get
together
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
one
who
was
willing
to
sell
is
not
boycotting
but
the
one,
nevertheless,
may
participate
in
the
understanding.
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
charge
in
this
case
and
the
only
question
at
this
point,
i
stress
is
whether
or
not
the
respondents
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial
on
their
claim.
the
charge
in
this
case
is
that
the
three
companies
other
than
st.
paul
refuse
to
deal
on
any
terms,
on
any
terms
with
the
large
number
of
doctors
to
whom
st.
paul
was
selling
insurance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
allegation.
there
was
no
charge
with
respect
to
the
specific
boycott
by
the
three
of
them.
there
is
a
charge
that
the
four
of
them
conspired
to
try
to
sell
insurance
on
a
claims-only
basis
and
to
eliminate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
have
to
check
that
and
see
i
do
not
think
that
was
specifically
alleged.
but
that
of
course
is
the
practical
consequence
of
it
because
there
are
only
the
allegations
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
not
sure
that
that
kind
of
economic
coercion
is
what
congress
had
in
mind,
in
the
coercion
language
of
mccarran-ferguson.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
not
think
that
would
be
a
boycott
but
if
it
reach
the
point
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
keeping
some
buyers
out
but
it
seems
to
me
the
point
could
be
reached
that
it
might
be
a
boycott
if
for
example,
the
big
four
automobile
makers
got
together
and
agree
they
will
not
sell
automobiles
to
anyone
in
a
particular
city
for
less
than
a
$100,000.00.
it
seems
to
me
at
some
point,
you
could
say
that
what
seemed
to
be
just
a
price-fixing
agreement
has
transcended
the
line
because
it
is
something
different
now
than
just
fixing
the
price.
it
is
obviously
something
designed
and
with
the
effect
of
excluding
them.
let
me
come
to
the
other
point
that
the
petitioners
make
and
the
mesa
as
well,
they
say
if
you
construe
mccarran-ferguson
to
treat
this
kind
of
thing,
this
absolutely
refusal
to
deal
as
a
boycott,
this
is
a
practical
matter
is
going
to
wipe
out
the
careful
system
of
regulation
that
the
states
have
built
up
over
the
years
and
again
it
is
in
terms
of
everything
can
be
framed
as
a
boycott.
and
therefore,
all
you
have
to
do
is
allege
that
an
agreement
among
insurance
companies
to
include
particular
terms
in
their
policies
or
particular
types
of
insurance
is
a
boycott
and
therefore
it
is
no
longer
within
the
state’s
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
it
is
subject
to
mccarran-ferguson.
now,
we
come
back
and
say
that
as
we
interpret
boycott,
boycott
is
not
this
open-ended
you
cannot
just
take
any
conceivable
thing
that
results
from
joint
action
and
say
that
it
is
a
boycott.
we
think
it
is
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
somewhat
narrow,
considerably
narrower
than
that.
and
as
thus
construed,
this
definition,
this
provision
would
give
the
states
the
authority
to
continue
basically
what
they
have
been
doing,
what
they
were
doing
at
the
time
of
south-eastern
underwriters.
they
can
continue
to
ensure
the
financial
solvency
of
the
insurance
companies
which
is
an
important
thing.
they
can
continue
to
control
the
rates
of
the
insurance
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
is
a
boycott,
state
law
makes
no
difference.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
would
not
if
it
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
were
a
state
action
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
not
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act
at
all
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
unless
if
the
state
ordered
them
to
do
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
unless
the
terms
were
so
oppressive
that
it
is
a
practical
matter,
the
refusal
to
deal
except
on
certain
terms
amounted
the
o
refusal
to
deal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
an
anti-trust
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
would
depend
whether
or
not
this
particular
course
of
conduct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
the
court
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
depend
on
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
say
you
are
in
the
court
but
you
may
be
out
very
quickly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
how
fast
or
if
he
stay
in
is
really
the
critical
question.
i
think
it
sure,
it
can
always
be
phrased
that
way
but
it
seems
to
me
if
that
is
all
that
it
is,
if
in
fact
turns
out
to
be
a
price-fixing
agreement,
i
would
think
such
a
complaint
could
be
rather
easily
dismissed
either
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
we
think
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
we
think
that
would
not
be
a
boycott.
that
would
be
a
traditional
price-fixing
agreement
and
the
one
thing
it
is
clear
from
mccarran-ferguson
it
seems
to
us
is
that
congress
intended
to
take
that
kind
of
an
agreement,
that
kind
of
a
price-fixing
agreement
out
from
under
the
sherman
act
and
live
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
states
because
that
of
course
was
the
essence,
that
was
one
of
the
most
important
things
of
state
regulation
at
the
time
of
south-eastern
underwriters
was
the
rate
bureaus
to
which
the
insurance
companies
were
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
boycott.
that
is
a
boycott,
if
they
say
we
refuse
to
deal
with
those
customers
of
st.
paul,
that
we
think
is
a
boycott.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
probably
would
have
to
disagree
with
it
but
i
would
qualify
to
this
extent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
point
out
this
distinction
that
what
proctor
said
was
in
a
rate
fixing
context,
in
a
rate
fixing
context,
it
believes
that
boycott
requires
some
enforcement
action.
that
was
a
case
where
the
insurance
companies
said
they
would
not
pay
more
than
certain
going
right
s
for
a
field
insurance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
think
that
is
not
a
proper
limitation.
we
think
that
even
in
the
right
fixing
context,
if
they
refuse
to
deal
with
certain
customers
that
we
think
that
is
a
boycott.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
suggested
you
have
to
do
something
more
than
in
the
rate
case,
you
have
to
do
something
more
than
just
refuse
to
deal.
you
have
to
do
something
more.
you
have
to
enforce
it
someway,
put
pressure.
he
suggested
there
was
not
a
claim,
for
instance,
that
they
would
not
refer
customers
except
to
the
repair
firms
who
agreed
to
their
terms
and
conditions
but
he
said
that
was
not
established
by
the
record
in
the
case
and
he
left
open.
i
take
if
that
might
have
been
the
kind
of
enforcement
procedure
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
was
a
detail
affidavits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
taken
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
he
thought
he
should
have
entirely
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
a
total
refusal.
let
me
justify
if
i
may
in
conclusion,
come
back
again
to
south-eastern
underwriters
where
of
course,
the
boycott
was
not
only
of
the
insurance
company
holders
but
of
the
policy
holders
and
while
it
is
true
that
that
was
the
context
in
which
it
was
done,
the
fact
is,
that
the
boycott
was
just
not
so
limited
and
i
would
like
to
close
with
what
the
court
stated
in
that
case.
in
answering
a
similar
argument
to
that
made
here,
there
the
contention
was
that
if
you
applied
the
sherman
act
itself
to
the
business
of
insurance,
this
would
uproot
and
destroy
state
regulation
and
speaking
for
the
court
justice
black
stated,
“no
states
authorize
combinations
of
insurance
companies
to
coerce,
intimidate,
and
boycott
competitors
and
consumers
in
the
manner
here
alleged.”
thank
you.
