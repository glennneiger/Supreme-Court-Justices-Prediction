justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
licensed
physicians
who
practice
in
rhode
island
and
some
of
their
patients.
petitioners
are
the
only
four
insurance
companies
that
write
medical
malpractice
insurance
in
that
state.
reacting
to
what
has
been
termed
the
medical
malpractice
crisis.
petitioner
st.
paul
fire
and
marine
insurance
company,
the
largest
of
these
four
insurers
announce
that
it
would
not
renew
medical
malpractice
coverage
on
an
occurrence
basis.
it
would
write
this
insurance
but
only
on
a
“claims
made”
basis.
this
basis
affords
substantially
less
coverage.
it
protects
a
position
only
against
claims
actually
filed
during
the
life
of
the
policy.
the
physicians
charge
in
this
case
that
the
other
three
insurance
companies,
the
only
ones
that
wrote
malpractice
insurance
in
rhode
island
other
than
st.
paul
agreed
not
to
accept
applications
for
any
type
of
insurance
from
physicians
and
other
medical
personnel
who
were
policy
holders
at
st.
paul's.
it
was
aware
that
this
was
an
illegal
boycott
intended
to
force
these
policy
holders
to
accept
the
new
limited
coverage
offered
by
st.
paul.
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
the
federal
antitrust
laws
are
wisely
preempted
by
state
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
but
the
sherman
act
remains
applicable,
“to
any
agreement
by
insurance
companies
to
boycott,
coerce,
or
intimidate.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
basis
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
boycott
clause
provides
a
measure
of
protection
to
policy
holders
when
they
are
victimized
by
private
conspiracies
of
insurance
companies
where
these
occur
outside
of
any
regulatory
or
co-operative
arrangement
established
under
the
laws
of
the
state.
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
policy
holders
may
be
victims
of
practices
falling
within
the
reach
of
the
boycott
exception
and
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
alleged
a
boycott
but
our
opinion
states
that
there
are
limits
to
today's
decision.
we
do
not
hold
that
the
sherman
act
is
applicable
to
all
private
agreements
in
the
insurance
business
and
we
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
state
has
decided
that
regulatory
policy,
in
the
public
interest,
requires
a
particular
allocation
of
risk
among
insurers
or
authorized
insurers
to
decline
to
accept
particular
risks.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined.
