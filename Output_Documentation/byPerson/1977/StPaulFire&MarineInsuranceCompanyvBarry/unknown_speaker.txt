unknown
speaker
that
was
a
substantial
change,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
had
it
been
used
by
the
insurance
industry
before
this
time?
unknown
speaker
at
all?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
policy
change
approved
by
the
insurance
commissioner
of
rhode
island?
unknown
speaker
are
they
approved
with
or
without
a
hearing
any
sort
of
general
notice
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
following
up
on
justice
powell’s
questions,
supposing
rhode
island
insurance
agent
or
commissioner,
whatever
the
body
is,
had
previously
approved
the
two
forms
of
policy,
one
on
(inaudible)
basis
and
the
other
an
occurrence
basis
policy,
would
there
be
any
requirement
of
rhode
island
law
that
the
insurance
company
such
as
st.
paul
must
seek
the
approval
of
the
commission
if
it
discontinues
the
use
of
one
of
the
two?
unknown
speaker
so
that
could
be
done
independently
by
the
company’s
own
decision
as
far
as
the
record
tells
us?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
2(b),
it
only
talks
about
not
invalidating
any
state
law
or
regulation
and
we
do
not
know
what
the
rhode
island
law
is,
as
i
understand
the
record.
so,
how
do
we
know
that
without
even
reaching
the
boycott
question,
how
do
we
know
that
2(b)
withdraws
an
agreement
among
three
competitors
not
to
sell
the
particular
customer
from
the
coverage
of
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
that
first
part?
unknown
speaker
the
second
part
says
that
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
does
not
say
the
latter.
we
say
that
it
implies
the
latter.
unknown
speaker
at
the
end
of
the
moratorium,
the
sherman
act,
--
does
it
not
say
at
the
end
of
the
moratorium,
the
sherman
act
shall
apply
to
the
extent
that
the
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
law?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
this
alleged
boycott,
i
know
you
do
not
like
the
word
boycott
for
this
but
this
refuse
of
the
deal,
is
that
regulated
by
state
law?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
says
it
is
not
an
unfair
practice
within
the
meaning
of
the
rhode
island
statute
,
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
is
it
regulating
or
not
regulating?
unknown
speaker
does
broadway
hale
against
klor’s
fit
into
that
category
you
think?
unknown
speaker
that
the
doctors
got
together
you
said?
unknown
speaker
your
hypothesis
is
that
the
first
group
of
doctors
would
says,
“we
will
not
buy
your
malpractice
insurance,
unless
you
refuse
to
sell
malpractice
insurance
to
the
other
group
of
doctors.”
unknown
speaker
well,
how
was
your
particular
hypothesis
that
you
were
just
advancing?
unknown
speaker
did
you
challenge
the
legitimacy
of
their
suggesting
that
the
word
boycott
be
given
interpretation
on
view
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
language?
unknown
speaker
but
does
an
issue
join
then
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
boycott
in
3(b)?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
arguing
here
now?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
both
get
down
to
the
question
of
the
meaning
at
least
in
part
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
boycott
in
3(b).
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
all
the
malpractice
insurers
in
that
country
had
jointly
announced
the
same
policy
that
st.
paul
announced,
would
that
not
have
precisely
the
same
effect
on
the
doctor?
unknown
speaker
one
point
you
emphasized,
or
seemed
to
emphasized
leads
me
to
ask
you,
what
states
in
the
country
are
there
in
which
the
st.
paul
company
does
not
do
business?
unknown
speaker
and
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
the
meaning
of
boycott
as
used
on
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr
decof,
of
course
the
problem
is
what
is
a
boycott?
in
your
view,
under
the
statute,
if
four
companies
got
together
and
agreed
on
a
territorial
allocation,
each
took
a
quarter
of
the
state
and
each
agreed
not
to
sell
on
the
other
three
quarters,
would
that
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
clearly
without
sufficient
redeeming
virtues
to
avoid
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
if
you
did
not
have
the
mccarran.
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
firstly
a
violation
if
we
use
those
terms.
but
how
do
we
decide
whether
it
is
a
boycott
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
my
example
would
be
a
boycott.
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
pretty
close
because
i
assume
your
allegation
is
the
three
companies
agreed
not
to
sell
the
former
customers
to
st
paul.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
the
same
as
an
agreement
not
to
sell
to
people
outside
the
geographical
territory,
the
same
kind
of
agreement?
unknown
speaker
you
are
really
discussing
the
question
whether
at
per
se
or
rule
of
reason
approach
applies.
but
that
is
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
whether
it
is
a
boycott
or
not
which
is
i
supposed
a
species
of
the
per
se
violations.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
well,
from
the
plaintiff’s
point
of
view,
if
it
were
unreasonable
in
his
view,
he
would
have
not
sued.
unknown
speaker
so,
from
his
point
of
view,
it
would
be
a
boycott,
would
it
not,
they
refuse
to
deal
but
may
accept
on
these
conditions;
i
think
they
are
boycotting
me
from
dealing
with
them
on
any
reasonable
basis.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
if
i
could
just
interrupt
for
a
second.
under
your
definition
as
i
understand
it,
the
three
out
of
the
four
are
refusing
to
deal
on
any
terms
at
all
and
therefore
their
participants
in
the
boycott.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
assume
that
the
claims
only
offered
by
st.
paul
was
a
reasonable
way
of
doing
business,
st.
paul
should
be
entitled
to
the
exemption,
should
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
friedman
does
the
boycott
not
imply
group
action?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
an
individual
cannot
engage
in
a
boycott,
no
matter
what
he
does.
he
may
engage
in
very
illegal
action
but
it
is
not
a
boycott
unless
they
are
two
or
more,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
does
that
even
hold
water
because
the
four
of
them
have
agreed
that
only
st.
paul
will
sell
to
them
on
this
set
of
terms.
so,
the
four
of
them
have
not
agreed
to
a
total
refusal
to
sell
at
this
point.
unknown
speaker
but
if
your
definition
requires
a
total
refusal,
the
group
has
not
made
such
a
total
refusal.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
any
difference
than
saying
we
will
refuse
to
let
them
deal
with
any
portion
of
the
market
that
is
willing
to
sell
at
less
than
a
dollar
or
thousand
or
whatever
the
premium
rate
is?
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
them
refuse
to
sell?
unknown
speaker
but
today,
you
got
one
willing
to
sell.
unknown
speaker
was
it
ever
alleged
what
the
purpose
was
of
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
is
it
alleged
that
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
among
the
three,
the
refusal
of
the
three
was
to
force
the
doctors
to
do
business
on
st.
paul’s
terms?
unknown
speaker
but
whether
it
was
a
boycott
or
not
then
would
it
have
been
coercion?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
either
a
boycott
or
it
is
nothing
under
3(b)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
what
if
the
big
four
automakers
all
get
together
and
agree
that
we
will
not
sell
car
to
any
buyer
for
less
than
$10,000.00,
is
that
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
it
is
keeping
buyers
out
of
the
automobile
market.
unknown
speaker
but
can
they
ever
though
unless
specifically
authorized
by
state
law,
can
they
ever
jointly
refuse
to
deal
with
the
group
of
possible
customers?
unknown
speaker
even
if
state
law
purported
expressly
to
authorize
and
approve
that,
it
would
still
be
subject
to
the
anti-trust
law?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
you
still
think
the
parker
against
brown
approach
would
be
applicable?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
what
i
am
saying
is
if
the
state
law
specifically
ordered
say,
specifically
ordered
the
companies
to
act
in
a
certain
way.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
that
if
they
got
together
and
refuse
to
deal
with
a
group
of
customers
at
all,
that
they
are
subject
to
the
sherman
act
boycott?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
not
be
an
illegal
boycott
if
they
refused
to
deal
except
on
certain
terms?
unknown
speaker
well
who
is
going
to
decide
that?
an
anti-trust
court,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
not
an
exemption.
unknown
speaker
and
somebody
has
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
so,
anybody
is
free
to
bring
in
an
anti-trust
action
under
your
theory?
but
this
consorted
refusal
to
deal
has
tantamount
to
a
boycott.
all
you
have
to
do
is
allege
that
in
your
complaint,
you
are
in
the
anti-trust
court
and
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
out
the
window?
unknown
speaker
correct?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
true
anytime
you
go
in
to
any
court
on
any
basis.
that
is
true
now,
it
is
true
now,
it
is
true
now.
you
can
get
into
court
and
the
question
is
how
fast
he
gets
out
now.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
say
that
just
a
widespread
agreement
among
insurance
companies
in
rhode
island
as
to
the
rates
at
which
they
would
sell
medical
malpractice
insurance
would
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
even
though
all
of
them
agree
not
to
do
business
with
anybody
except
on
that
term?
unknown
speaker
but
if
st.
paul
is
willing
to
sell
at
certain
rights
or
on
a
certain
way
and
three
other
companies’
just
get
together
and
say
we
refuse
to
deal
with
those
putative
customers
of
st.
paul
that
is
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
proctor
case,
that
it
is
a
criteria
that
it
worked
out
or
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to.
unknown
speaker
--
or
repair
insurance.
unknown
speaker
judge
mcallen’s
opinion
seems
to
require
some
sort
of
coercion
at
least
in
that
context.
unknown
speaker
that
was
an
affirmance
of
a
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes
it
was.
unknown
speaker
there
had
been,
there
was
a
whole
at
least
--
unknown
speaker
there
was
the
affirmance
of
a
summary
judgment
for
the
defendant
and
that
was
the
basis
of
judge
rights
to
dissent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
following
up
on
justice
stewart’s
question,
supposing
the
plaintiff
here
had
alleged
that
all
four
companies
have
refused
to
do
business
in
any
terms
except
the
claims-made
basis,
this
had
never
been
tried
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
which
the
have
alleged,
would
that
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
explicit
really
that
congress
drew
that
line,
am
i
not
correct
whether
you
changed
your
position
since
the
court
of
appeals
too,
have
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
became
clear
between
the
argument
there
and
here
were
the
congress
drew
the
line.
unknown
speaker
let
me
test
your
theory
for
a
moment,
supposing
the
insurance
companies
thought
brain
surgery
was
particularly
risky
business
or
something
like
that,
they
all
agreed
that
none
of
them
would
insure
brain
surgery,
total
exclusion,
would
that
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
can
someone
insure
this
particular
category
of
risk.
no
brain
surgery
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
said,
no
malpractice
insurance
at
all,
would
that
be
a
boycott?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
a
boycott?
