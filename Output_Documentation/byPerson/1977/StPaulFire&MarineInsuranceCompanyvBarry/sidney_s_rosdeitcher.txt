mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
for
the
first
time,
a
question
of
interpretation
of
a
central
portion
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
specifically,
under
section
2(b)
of
that
act,
congress
withdrew
the
sherman
act
and
other
federal
anti-trust
laws
from
the
business
of
insurance,
if
the
states
enacted
regulatory
legislation
specifically
provides
that
the
sherman
act
and
other
anti-trust
law
shall
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
not
regulated
by
the
states.
under
section
3(b)
of
the
act,
congress
provided
an
exception
to
this
policy
of
deference
to
state
regulation.
it
provided
that
federal
regulation
under
the
sherman
act
would
be
reserved
and
would
continue
to
apply
in
cases
of
boycott,
coercion,
or
intimidation.
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
interpreted
that
exception
so
expansively
that
it
nullified
the
policy
of
section
2(b)
to
withdraw
the
sherman
act
and
the
anti-trust
laws
in
most
cases
from
the
business
of
insurance
where
the
states
enacted
regulation.
this
afternoon,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
the
result
reached
by
the
first
circuit
was
unnecessary
that
it
was
not
required
by
what
the
first
circuit
believed
was
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase
“boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.”
that
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
use
of
those
terms
in
this
court
marked
out
a
more
reasonable
boundary
line
which
would
have
preserved
and
given
meaning
to
both
section
3(b)
and
section
2(b).
before
i
turn
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
if
you
will,
to
give
a
very
brief
history
which
i
think
will
put
those
facts
and
issues
in
this
case
in
perspective.
for
more
than
a
century,
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
and
particularly
the
relationship
between
the
policy
holder
and
the
insurance
company
was
assumed
to
be
and
was
totally
within
the
hands
of
the
states.
in
1944,
this
court
in
south-eastern
underwriters’
case
held
that
at
least
one
set
of
federal
regulation
would
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance
namely
the
sherman
act,
and
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
in
the
following
year,
1945,
congress
reacted
to
that
decision
and
it
enacted
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
this
court
has
already
said
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
place
the
force
of
federal
law
behind
state
regulation.
it
specifically
recognizes
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
that
state
regulation
of
insurance
be
the
policy
in
this
country.
and
finally,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
turn
back
the
clock
in
most
part
to
where
it
stood
prior
to
south-easter
underwriters
and
placed
the
regulation
of
insurance
and
leave
the
regulation
of
the
policyholder,
insurance
company
relationship
particularly
in
the
hands
of
the
states.
this
case
raises
an
issue
about
one
portion
of
that
congressional
endeavor.
as
i
said,
it
relates
to
the
decision
of
congress
to
withdraw
the
sherman
act
from
the
business
of
insurance
with
an
exception
for
boycotts,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
the
tension
between
those
two
provisions
is
presented
starkly
in
this
case
and
let
me
briefly
recite
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
are
two
groups.
they
purport
to
bring
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
doctors
in
rhode
island
and
patients
of
those
doctors
or
future
patients.
the
doctors
claim
that
they
were
insured
by
the
st.
paul
fire
and
marine
and
that
for
sometime
they
were
getting
an
insurance
policy
whose
terms
they
were
satisfied
with
essentially.
a
policy
known
as
an
occurrence
basis
policy
which
provides
briefly
that
the
claim
will
be
paid
by
the
insurance
company
for
any
event
which
occurred
during
the
term
of
the
policy
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
made
at
a
later
time.
sometime
in
april
1975,
st.
paul
announced
to
its
insureds
that
it
would
not
renew
those
policies
on
that
basis
but
would
renew
only
on
a
so-called
claims-made
basis
which
limited
the
liability
of
the
company
by
providing
that
it
would
only
pay
for
claims
submitted
during
the
term
on
claims
which
arose
during
the
term
of
the
policy.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that
was
a
very
substantial
change.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
had
been
used
by
the
insurance
industry
before
this
time
elsewhere;
it
had
not
been
used
by
these
companies
at
that
time.
the
doctor
said
they
were
dissatisfied
with
this
policy
and
that
they
went
to
three
other
companies,
my
client
aetna,
hartford,
and
travelers,
and
that
those
companies
would
not
sell
them
any
insurance.
they
then
filed
this
action.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
they
said
they
would
not
sell
them
any
insurance
at
all,
then
filed
this
action
under
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
now
if
i
stop
there,
before
getting
to
the
question
of
boycott,
i
will
go
back
to
what
i
said
as
to
why
this
case
starkly
raises
the
tension
between
section
2(b)
and
3(b).
to
start
with,
this
case
plainly
involves
the
business
of
insurance.
it
is
the
very
essence
of
the
business
of
insurance.
the
question
is
what
kind
of
policies
the
companies
are
willing
to
sell.
at
what
terms,
what
policies
would
be
issued?
rhode
island
regulated
the
business
of
insurance
extensively.
everybody
accepted
this
but
it
is
worth
considering
how
they
did
regulate
it.
they
not
only
had
a
statute
aimed
at
anti-competitive
practice
passed
in
direct
response
in
mccarran
act,
but
at
the
very
time,
we
had
what
looks
like
a
race
to
see
who
can
get
there
first.
consider
the
events
april
18,
1975;
st.
paul
makes
its
announcement.
somewhere
in
between
on
specifying
the
complaint,
these
plaintiffs
decide
that
there
was
some
kind
of
conspiracy.
june
1,
1975,
the
first
complaint
in
this
action
is
filed.
june
16,
1975,
rhode
island
commences
the
joint
underwriting
association
designed
to
takeover
the
business
of
insurance
and
deal
with
some
of
the
very
problems
which
are
dealt
with
here,
namely
the
so-called
medical
malpractice
insurance
crisis.
so
we
have
the
spectacle
of
a
federal
court
action
on
the
one
hand
began
directed
at
what
they
claim
is
a
conspiracy
as
the
cause
of
this
crisis.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
call
it
a
crisis
first
because
the
rhode
island
administrator
who
issued
the
regulation
shortly
after
the
action
began
called
it
a
crisis.
i
think
it
was
a
crisis
because
there
was
difficulty
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
well
known
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
that
there
has
been
difficulty
in
obtaining
medical
malpractice
insurance
that
rates
have
gone
very
high,
what
the
cause
is
for
that
are
not
the
subject
to
this
action.
in
our
view,
what
the
causes
were
are
matters
to
be
determined
by
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
we
think
rhode
island
did
--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
think
if
i
may,
i
think
there
probably
was
at
that
time
a
national
crisis.
there
is
a
list
of
statutes
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
something
like
37
states,
i
believe,
have
enacted
similar
type
of
joint
underwriting
associations
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
availability
and
the
cost
of
malpractice
insurance.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
widespread,
it
is
a
national
crisis
whether
everybody
views
it
as
such,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
all
policy
forms
have
to
be
approved
whether
this
specific
policy
change
was
approved,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
my
recollection
is
that
they
are
filed
for
approval
and
that
the
hearings
relate
to
rates
whether
the
policy
terms
themselves
are
filed
for
approval
with
the
commissioner.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
do
not
know
that?
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
as
far
as
the
record
goes,
that
is
all
we
know.
this
was
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
no,
it
does
not
accept
to
the
extent
that
it
has
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
it,
but
i
might
say,
justice
rehnquist
that
in
our
view
the
practices
in
rhode
island,
the
way
they
enforce
it,
the
effectiveness
of
the
enforcement
are
not
pertinent
to
the
question
which
is
raised
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
whether
there
is
an
effective
method?
whether
the
enforcement
is
vigorous
or
whether
it
is
passive
is
really
an
issue
which
this
court
has
earlier
decided
in
the
national
casualty
cases,
not
a
question
appropriate
for
federal
court
to
review
in
the
mccarran
act
case.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
am
not
sure
whether
if
they
simply
said
we
are
not
going
to
pass
any
law
and
we
will
just
have.
they
could
have
done
this
and
i
think
let
me
review
what
they
did
do.
they
passed
the
statute
which
was
directed
at
unfair
methods
and
anti
competitive
methods
of
competition.
they
defined
certain
of
those
methods
including
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation
which
they
outlawed
and
then
they
left
to
the
commissioner
the
same
kind
of
power
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
to
define
anti-competitor
practices
as
they
go.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
that
statute,
that
statute
was
enough
as
many
cases
upheld
and
as
i
believe
this
court
effectively
held
in
the
ftc
v.
national
casualty
case
and
i
am
saying
that
that
statute
reflects
a
rhode
island
policy
and
reflects
a
kind
of
regulation
which
meets
the
requirements
of
section
2(b)
to
trigger
the
exemption.
i
had
come
to
the
point
where
i
had
pointed
out
that
first,
the
business
of
insurance
was
plainly
involved,
the
heart
of
it.
that
rhode
island
extensively
regulates
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
i
must
say
that
the
unfair
practice
of
statute
itself
would
have
been
enough
regulation
without
more.
i
added
that
this
case
is
a
stocker
situation
because
rhode
island
had
actually
taken
steps
to
focus
on
the
problems
of
course,
and
availability
of
malpractice.
the
first
circuit
however
held
that
these
plaintiffs
could
maintain
a
suit
because
they
had
alleged
a
concerted
refusal
by
the
three
companies
to
sell
malpractice
insurance
to
the
dissatisfied
policy
holders
of
st.
paul,
who
when
they
could
not
get
the
occurrence
basis
policy
from
st.
paul
sought
coverage
from
the
other
three.
in
so
doing,
the
first
circuit
rejected
not
only
the
district
court
and
the
views
of
a
dissenting
judge
there
but
a
number
of
other
decisions
and
other
circuits
which
expressed
this
fear
about
that
kind
of
interpretation.
but
if
you
focus
on
just
a
consorted
refusal
to
deal
without
more,
then
virtually
any
collaborative
conduct
among
insurance
companies
could
be
styled
and
pleaded
as
a
boycott,
if
the
boycott
meant
a
consorted
refusal
of
deal
and
was
equivalent
with
it.
now,
some
other
courts
had
look
at
south-eastern
underwriters
and
legislative
history
and
it
concluded
that
it
was
limited
that
that
phrase
“boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation”
was
limited
at
the
type
of
conduct
directed
in
involvement
of
south-eastern
underwriters
directed
at
insurance
companies,
at
excluding
insurance
companies
from
the
business
at
forcing
them
to
behave
in
the
way
the
conspiracy
dictated.
they
limited
the
provision
to
insurance
agent,
acts
aimed
suppressing
or
dictating
the
policies
of
insurance
companies
and
insurance
agents.
we
do
not
say
that
that
particular
gloss
is
necessary.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
result
which
the
first
circuit
achieved
here
which
was
to
define
a
boycott
in
a
way
which
would
virtually
swallow
up
the
rest
of
the
2(b)
exemption
need
not
have
occurred
and
that
the
first
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
concluded
that
it
was
compelled
to
reach
this
result
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase
“boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.”
now
i
start
my
statutory
analysis
where
i
think
the
government
does
and
probably
my
opponents
and
most
of
the
commentators
and
judge
mcallen
in
the
dc
circuit
in
the
recent
proctor
case.
and
that
is
with
south-easter
underwriters
because
lo
and
behold,
the
phrase
“boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation”
appears
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters’
case.
now
there,
what
happened
was
this
and
it
is
crucial
to
focus
on
the
two
types
of
conduct
which
south-eastern
underwriters’
dealt
with.
to
start
with,
there
was
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
on
fire
insurance
throughout
the
south-eastern
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
court
called
that
price
fixing.
in
addition
to
the
price
fixing
conspiracy,
there
was
a
conspiracy
among
the
members
of
the
south-eastern
underwriters
association
to
force
everyone
to
do
business
on
their
terms
and
that
took
two
forms.
first,
there
was
conduct
which
was
specifically
directed
at
other
insurance
companies
and
agents.
in
the
case
of
insurance
companies,
one
of
the
principle
ways
was
to
refuse
to
reinsure
their
risk
and
this
was
vital
and
they
withdrew
re-insurance
from
any
company
which
was
unwilling
to
follow
the
price-fixing
conspiracy.
in
the
case
of
the
agent,
they
had
something
called
the
separation
and
they
said
to
the
agent,
if
you
handle
the
product
of
a
price-cutter,
we
are
going
to
put
you
out
of
business
because
we
are
not
going
to
sell
you
any
insurance.
another
way,
they
dealt
with
this
was
they
sold
fire
insurance
and
allied
lines
and
they
said
to
the
consumer,
“if
you
deal
with
one
of
these
price-cutters
on
fire
insurance,
we
are
not
going
to
sell
you
other
products.
we
are
just
going
to
not
deal
with
you
at
all”.
in
order
to
induce
those
policy
holders
not
to
deal
with
the
price-cutters.
now,
we
think
that
south-eastern
underwriters
itself
demonstrates
what
the
court,
not
only
what
the
court
but
what
congress
must
have
meant
by
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
and
i
would
like
to
draw
a
line,
if
i
could
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the
question
of
the
policy
of
competition.
that
is
what
the
sherman
act
and
the
anti-
trust
laws
are
all
about.
to
enfoster
competition
between
companies
and
if
under
the
sherman
act,
that
there
were
no
mccarran
act,
companies
getting
together
and
deciding
they
would
not
compete,
will
not
sell
insurance
to
their
competitor’s
policy
holders
would
be
a
violation
of
sherman
act.
section
2(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
however
says,
the
general
question
of
whether
a
state
should
have
a
policy
of
competition
or
non-competition
in
insurance
should
be
for
the
state.
if
the
state
enacts
regulation,
dealing
with
that
area
then
the
state
occupies
the
field
and
the
sherman
act
is
withdrawn.
now,
where
is
it
that
congress,
what
did
congress
reserve?
in
the
boycott
section,
it
said
one
thing
was
different.
that
is,
it
is
one
thing
for
people
not
to
compete
with
one
anther
and
for
the
state
either
by
an
authorizing
law
or
by
a
little
sherman
act
or
a
little
ftc
act
to
pursue
a
policy
of
competition,
non-competition,
or
a
policy
somewhere
in
between.
it
is
another
thing
for
the
private
companies
to
take
it
into
their
own
hands
to
say
that
those
who
do
want
to
compete
and
are
permitted
to
compete
should
be
excluded
from
the
business
and
that
pressure
should
be
applied
to
those
who
want
to
compete
not
to
deal
with
those
people
in
order
to
exclude
those
who
wish
to
compete.
in
short,
a
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation,
however
you
use
those
phrases
whether
separately
or
singly,
is
a
kind
of
penal
enforcement
conduct
aimed
at
regulating
competition
by
excluding
those
who
will
want
to
compete.
and
as
i
see
the
line,
on
one
side,
you
have
agreements
between
which
the
states
either
can
prohibit
or
can
apply
the
rule
of
reasonableness
test
or
outlaw
per
se
just
as
under
the
sherman
act
or
authorize.
and
on
the
other
hand,
conduct
which
says
we,
the
private
industry
will
decide
who
does
business
and
we
will
decide
whether
you
can
compete.
and
that
in
our
view,
that
pressure
to
prevent
people
who
do
want
to
compete
from
competing
is
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
think
there
is
this
line
to
be
drawn
there,
if
the
pressure
is
being
applied
to
the
customer
because
he
deals
with
the
price-cutter.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
your
case
is
a
boycott,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
the
customer
might,
that
might
be
a
question
standing.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
think
that
would
raise
a
question
of
standing
your
honor.
i
think
in
my
circuit,
we
would
argue
that
consumer
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
the
mccarran
act
would
not
bar
the
suit
by
the
customer
but
that
is
a
classic
boycott
because
what
you
described
is
exactly
what
we
believe
a
boycott
is.
that
is
pressure
applied
to
the
customer
not
to
deal
with
the
price-cutter.
to
put
the
fellow
who
does
want
to
compete
out
of
business.
to
put
the
fellow
who
does
not
want
to
obey
the
price
fixing
conspiracy
out
of
business.
and
unless
you
draw
from
some
such
line,
you
nullify,
you
erase
any
distinction
between
what
was
left
out
in
section
2(b)
and
withdrawn
from
the
sherman
act
and
what
is
covered
by
the
boycott
section.
and
what
you
described
justice
white
did
not
occur
here.
that
is
not
claim.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
let
me
take
that
in
two
stages,
your
honor.
first
problem
is
that
2(b)
is
divided
into
two
parts.
you
will
notice
that
the
first
part
is
very
different
or
somewhat
different
than
the
second
part.
the
first
part
talks
generally
and
says,
“congress
should
not
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
any
state
law.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
two,
then
you
have
the
proviso.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
no,
we
rely
on
the
second
part.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
we
rely
on
both
parts
but
specifically,
on
the
second
part
which
is
different.
it
is
different
and
that
it
says
that
the
sherman
act
shall
apply
to
the
extent
the
business
of
insurance
is
not
regulated
by
that
states
or
put
directly
that
the
sherman
act
shall
not
apply
if
the
states
regulate.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
well,
i
think
you
have
to
conclude
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute
how
it
came
about,
the
initial
bill,
that
went
to
conference,
did
not
have
that
provision
in
there.
it
had
the
first
half
that
i
just
repeat,
invalidate
and
had
the
3(b),
what
is
now
the
3(b)
exception
ahead
of
3(a)
moratorium.
simply
said,
the
sherman
act
quite
not
so
will
not
apply
at
all.
that
meant
that
if
you
just
read
it
that
way,
that
at
the
end
of
the
moratorium
period,
you
would
have
to
have
a
statute
which
was
invalidated
in
pair
or
superseded
in
order
to
be
affected
by
the
2(b)
provision.
but
they
stuck
another
provision
here,
the
one
i
just
read
about
the
anti-trust
laws
which
says
that
if
the
states
regulate
or
sets
it
backwards
but
it
does
say,
what
happens
at
the
end
of
the
moratorium.
now
let
us
follow
moratorium
--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
yes,
in
this
way
and
in
a
way
accepted
by
this
court.
i
will
leave
out
all
the
other
statutes,
i
have
talked
about.
the
record
is
very
clear
that
rhode
island
has
an
unfair
practices
statute
which
says
specifically,
we
are
passing
this
in
response
to
mccarran
act.
we
intend
to
regulate
all
competitive
practices
in
the
business
of
insurance.
and
we
provide
among
other
things
and
say
that,
that
boycotts
are
unlawful,
coercion
and
intimidation
is
unlawful.
and
then
we
give
to
the
insurance
commission,
the
power
like
the
federal
trade
commission
to
decide
on
a
case
by
case
basis
what
other
practices
should
be
struck
down
as
unfair
methods
of
competition.
now,
we
know
that
price
fixing
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
has
long
ago
been
considered
as
unlawful
per
se
under
the
ftc
act.
we
do
not
know
what
the
policy
is
going
to
be
on
this
specific
case,
if
any.
in
the
case
of
the
conduct
alleged
here,
but
that
is
precisely
what
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
leaves
to
that
state
insurance
commission.
he
could
decide
a
number
of
things.
he
could
say
this
conduct
is
unlawful
per
se
just
like
the
federal
law.
well,
if
he
does
and
he
has
done
one
of
the
things
that
he
could
have
done
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
left
him
with
power
to
regulate.
he
could
also
have
said,
“i
do
not
accept
federal
law
in
this
area.”
i
am
closer
to
the
ground
as
one
of
the
courts
has
said
about
the
reason
for
mccarran
act.
i
know
things
better.
i
understand
this
problem
a
lot
better
than
the
federal
government
does.
there
may
be
some
reasonable
justification
to
this
so,
i
am
going
to
consider
that.
that
is
his
prerogative
wherein
they
say
it
is
outlaw.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
then
he
has
accepted
the
justification
--
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
he
is
regulating
because
that
was
the
precise
issue
your
honor
raised
in
ftc
v.
national
casualty.
let
me
go
back
to
that
case
because
it
has
great
application
here.
in
ftc
v.
national
casualty,
the
question
whether
certain
advertising
practices
of
insurance
company
were
regulated
by
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
this
court
said
that
because
the
state
had
a
law
which
prohibits
unfair
and
deceptive
practices
that
that
law
asks
the
federal
jurisdiction
altogether.
this
court
did
not
say
that
the
local
administrator
had
to
conclude
like
the
ftc
that
it
was
deceptive.
in
fact,
one
of
the
premises
of
the
briefs
before
the
court
was
that
was
precisely
where
the
conflict
could
arise
because
the
state
administrator
could
decide
“i
do
not
think
this
is
deceptive.
in
my
knowledge
of
the
insurance
business,
this
is
not
deceptive.”
and
i
say
here,
the
state
should
be
free
and
i
think
that
was
precisely
the
intent
to
section
2(b)
to
leave
under
this
regulatory
law,
the
power
to
the
state
to
decide
should
this
agreement
alleged
in
this
complaint,
should
that
conduct
be
deemed
anti-competitive.
in
fact,
rhode
island
took
a
different
course
here.
rhode
island
did
not
look
to
hobgoblins
of
conspiracies.
instead
it
said,
there
is
a
real
problem
here,
we
are
going
to
deal
with
it
with
a
joint
underwriting
association,
a
method
used
by
other
states
in
other
areas.
so,
we
think
there
is
regulation.
it
is
in
the
record.
i
am
sorry
i
misspoke
myself
about
the
question
of
policy
approvals
earlier.
i
think
the
line
that
we
are
tying
to
draw
here
between
boycotts
on
the
one
hand,
enforcement
activity
designed
to
pressure
other
people
to
stop
competing
and
policies
of
competition
on
the
other
side
is
not
only
confirmed
by
south-eastern
underwriters.
it
is
equally
confirmed
by
other
hazes
in
this
court.
judge
coffin
was
persuaded
that
his
result
was
compelled
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
plain
meaning
first
of
all
of
boycott,
coercion,
intimidation
is
not
all
that
plain,
in
our
view.
but
we
went
back
and
looked
at
the
boycott
cases.
not
only
at
south-eastern
underwriters
where
the
conduct
was
entirely
different
than
what
is
alleged
here
but
at
fashion
originators’
guild,
at
eastern
retail
lumber
and
so
forth.
and
each
of
those
cases,
you
find
the
same
common
thread.
you
find
conspirators
getting
together
to
try
to
dictate
the
terms
on
which
someone
will
compete
and
to
force
out
of
business,
those
who
will
not
listen
to
the
conspiracy’s
terms
dictated
by
the
conspirators.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
broadway
hale
fits
into
what
was
our
second
which
are
a
second
part
of
the
definition
to
exclude
them
all
together.
that
is
where
competitors
get
together
to
either
refuse
the
deal
entirely
or
refuse
deal
in
part
in
order
to
exclude
one
of
the
competitors
of
one
of
the
conspirators
from
the
business
entirely
regardless
of
what
it
does
and
broadway
hale
was
exactly
that
case.
and
again
that
case
is
not
involved
here.
i
could
suppose
and
there
are
cases
and
this
is
what
helped
us
change
and
modify
our
view
a
little
bit,
was
in
considering
the
proctor
case
or
in
considering
the
ballard
case
where
if
were
alleged
that
the
doctors
got
together
and
said
let
us
finish
all
of
these
class
of
doctors
over
here.
let
us
induce
the
insurance
companies
not
to
give
them
any
insurance.
that
that
would
be
a
boycott
in
my
view
under
the
standard
not
court
cases.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
let
us
suppose,
i
am
just
raising
a
hypothetical
that
a
bunch
of
doctors
in
providence
who
did
not
like
these
group
of
doctors
said
let
us
not
knock
this
fellows
out
of
competition.
and
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
go
to
the
insurance
companies
and
induce
them
not
to
do
business
with
this
group
of
doctors
so
that
we
can
put
them
out
of
business,
that
would
be
a
boycott.
in
my
view,
that
would
be
force
that
was
forced.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
refusing
the
right
to
malpractice
insurance
for
the
purpose
of
putting
them
out
of
business.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
that
was
a
general
motors
case.
that
would
be
one
hypothesis
that
would
be
one
form
of
a
boycott.
mr.
sidney
s.
rosdeitcher
i
actually
did
not
put
that
little
extra
touch
on
the
doctors
themselves.
if
the
doctors
were
able
to
persuade
whether
through
withholding
their
own
custom
or
simply
out
of
their
persuasive
power
to
go
with
an
implied
threat
that
they
might
not
deal
with
these
companies
and
said
to
the
companies,
do
not
deal
with
them
because
we
want
to
put
them
out
of
business.
that
would
be
a
boycott.
that
would
be
klors,
that
would
be
united
states
against
general
motors.
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
point
i
started.
i
am
meeting
into
my
rebuttal
time
but
i
think
i
will
do
that,
if
the
court
pleases.
and
that
is
back
where
i
started
from
to
the
policy
of
the
act.
i
think
this
act
does
have
a
relatively
clear
purpose
and
that
is
to
have
the
federal
power
defer
in
the
area
of
regulation
of
the
insurance
business
and
where
the
states
have
regulated
to
put
policies
of
competition
in
the
hands
of
the
states.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
nullifies
that
purpose
because
as
i
said
earlier
the
key
area
of
regulation
left
to
the
states
was
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
policyholder
and
matters
affecting
the
terms,
rates,
and
availability
of
coverage
to
the
policyholder.
that
is
exactly
what
is
involved
here.
i
think
that
judge
coffin’s
decision
although
we
do
not
have
to
show
an
actual
conflict
in
the
state
regulatory
policy
and
the
sherman
act
in
order
to
trigger
the
2(b)
exemption.
i
think
there
is
a
conflict
and
there
is
an
area
of
conflict
involved
here.
and
that
area
is
this,
first
questions
of
conspiracy
always
questions
a
fact
and
different
fact
finders
can
view
those
facts
differently
depending
on
what
they
understand
to
be
the
underlying
conditions.
rhode
island
could
very
well
come
to
a
very
different
factual
conclusion
from
viewing
all
the
facts
in
any
case
under
its
unfair
methods
of
competition
law
or
in
deciding
whether
to
use
that
law
or
employ
a
joint
underwriting
association.
so
there
could
be
inconsistent
conclusions
of
fact
as
to
what
the
causes
of
the
medical
malpractice
problems
here
were.
there
could
be
different
conclusions
as
to
what
standard
of
law
should
apply
whether
you
should
apply
the
per
se
rule
which
applies
to
agreements
not
to
compete
under
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
or
whether
you
should
apply
some
rule
of
reason
test.
perhaps
there
was
some
justification.
perhaps
some
things
were
so
bad
that
the
insurance
commissions
say
well
this
is
not
so
bad
if
these
guys
said,
“look,
let
us
stop
selling
this
policy,
it
is
going
to
drive
us
all
insolvent
and
no
one
will
have
any
malpractice
insurance.”
i
think
there
are
other
areas
where
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
threatens,
accepted
insurance
practices.
that
is
not
crucial
to
my
position
but
i
think
it
is
true.
the
respondents
have
said,
that
if
you
have
a
joint
insurance,
like
the
jua
and
if
you
take
canter
to
the
one
side,
and
the
first
circuit’s
decision
to
the
other,
what
you
have
to
conclude
is
that
in
every
case
of
refusal
of
coverage
under
the
jua,
is
possible
to
commence
a
federal
anti-trust
suit
and
claim
that
that
is
a
consorted
refusal
by
the
members
of
the
jua
to
deal
with
that
policyholder.
it
may
be
wrong.
they
say
apply
a
rule
of
reason
but
that
will
not
save
it.
that
will
not
save
at
all.
that
will
not
save
the
policy
of
the
act.
because
the
question
of
reasonableness
is
precisely
the
question
which
was
left
to
the
state
insurance
department.
for
all
of
those
reasons,
the
reasons
of
policy,
for
reasons
of
making
this
statute
meaningful
and
work,
we
suggest
that
the
line
we
propose
should
be
drawn
and
that
the
boycott,
coercion,
intimidation
should
be
limited
to
what
was
involved
in
south-eastern
underwriters
and
other
boycott
cases,
namely
pressure
by
competitors
to
prevent
other
people
from
engaging
in
a
policy
of
competition.
thank
you.
