mr.
hughes,
may
i
come
back
to
initial
--
back
to
the
--
was
suggested
by
a
statement,
i
think
you
made
it
to
the
effect
that
the
missing
musical
instruments
were
not
found
in
the
defendant's
quarters.
were
they
ever
accounted
for?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
was
no
evidence
with
respect
to
where
they
were?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
explanation
on
the
statement
made
at
the
preliminary
hearing
that
they
had
been
found
in
defendant's
apartment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr,
hughes
before
you
sit
down,
your
brief
and
your
opponent's
brief
were
both
filed
before
our
decision
last
spring
in
manson
v.
brathwaite.
do
you
think
that
case
has
any
bearing
on
this
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
explanation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
not
--
you
have
not
argued
this
in
your
brief,
have
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
next
question
i
was
going
to
ask.
where
do
you
go
from
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
elaborate
on
why
you
think
this
was
not
a
lineup?
what
is
the
difference,
practically
speaking
between
an
accused
facing
--
in
the
circumstances
of
this
defendant
and
one
in
the
circumstances
where
you
would
concede
that
was
a
lineup?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
an
illinois
state
court
of
rape
and
related
offenses.
at
his
trial
the
complaining
witness
testified
on
direct
examination
by
the
prosecution
that
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
she
had
identified
petitioner
as
a
man
who
had
attacked
her.
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
counsel
when
this
identification
was
made.
after
exhausting
the
state
remedies,
petitioner
sought
relief
by
habeas
corpus
in
a
federal
district
court.
he
argued
first
that
he
should
have
been
represented
by
counsel
when
the
complaining
witness
identified
him
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
he
further
contended
that
the
state's
testimony
at
trial
as
to
his
prior
un-counseled
identification
violated
his
rights
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
denied
the
writ,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari.
the
preliminary
hearing
at
which
the
identification
took
place
occurred
after
the
initiation
of
adversary
additional
criminal
proceedings.
under
the
cases
of
this
court
petitioner
therefore
was
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
in
gilbert
against
california
the
court
also
made
clear
that
it
is
reversible
error
for
the
prosecution
to
elicit
testimony
at
trial
a
better
prior
identification
made
as
in
this
case
in
circumstances
where
there
was
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
we
therefore
reverse
and
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
court
will
be
free
however,
to
determine
whether
the
error
in
admitting
this
testimony
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
a
concurring
opinions,
mr.
justice
stevens
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
