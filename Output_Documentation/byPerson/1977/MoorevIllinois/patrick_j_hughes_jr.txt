mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
is
challenging
the
validity
of
his
illinois
rape
conviction,
a
conviction
based
on
the
witness
identification
testimony
of
the
one
and
only
eyewitness
to
the
crime.
the
victim
is
a
white
woman
who
was
sleeping
in
a
darkened
room
when
she
was
awaken
by
a
noise.
she
then
had
at
most
a
10-15
second
opportunity
to
observe
the
face
and
the
figure
of
her
masked,
black
assailant,
i
am
sorry,
unmasked,
black
assailant,
subsequently
he
was
masked
during
the
course
of
the
commission
of
the
--
of
the
crime.
a
conviction
for
which
the
petitioner
is
presently
serving
a
50
--
30
to
50
years
sentence
of
imprisonment.
the
crime
occurred
on
december
14th,
1967.
in
the
week
after
the
crime
occurred,
this
witness
had
two
opportunities
to
view
various
photographs,
but
made
no
identification
of
anyone
from
those
photographs.
seven
days
after
the
assault,
without
any
showing
of
existent
circumstances,
without
any
showing
of
necessity,
the
police
brought
this
sole
eyewitness
to
a
courtroom
where
the
petitioner
was
scheduled
to
appear,
charged
with
the
crime
that
was
committed
upon
her.
the
witness
was
brought
to
that
courtroom
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
identification.
that
identification
proceeding
was
to
be
her
first
opportunity
to
view
any
person
since
the
date
of
the
--
of
the
crime,
since
the
time
of
the
assault,
she
had
viewed
no
suspect
prior
to
that
time.
when
she
arrived
at
that
courtroom
over
her
objection
and
before
she
viewed
the
suspect,
she
was
asked
to
sign
the
formal
charge
that
are
already
been
placed
against
the
petitioner
in
that
courtroom.
she
was
then
placed
in
that
courtroom
to
wait
and
while
she
was
waiting
there
she
saw
other
cases.
in
the
course
of
seeing
those
cases
as
the
defendants’
name
in
those
cases
was
called,
the
defendants
were
brought
out
from
the
lockup,
the
defendants
in
custody
were
brought
out
from
the
lockup
and
she
observed
that
happening
for
some
period
of
time
before
the
petitioner’s
case
was
called.
the
petitioner’s
name
was
then
called,
a
name
she
recognized
because
she
had
seen
it
on
the
complaint
that
the
police
had
asked
her
to
sign
a
few
minutes
time
earlier,
a
complaint
she
did
not
want
to
sign
without
making
an
identification,
but
which
nonetheless
at
the
urging
she
did.
the
petitioner
was
then
brought
out
from
the
lockup
and
stood
before
the
bench,
before
the
judge.
the
complainant,
the
sole
eyewitness
was
then
asked
by
the
clerk,
her
name
was
called
by
the
clerk
and
she
was
asked
to
come
up.
she
was
brought
up
to
stay
and
seven
or
eight
feet
from
the
place
where
the
defendant,
petitioner
was
standing
in
front
of
that
same
judge.
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
stood
there,
not
only
was
he
an
indigent
without
counsel,
but
in
violation
of
an
illinois
statute
which
specifically
required
that
the
judge
advise
him
of
his
right
to
have
counsel,
he
was
not
so
advised.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
no
sir.
i
believe
that
you
will
find
that
the
entire
proceeding
is
reported
on
pages
48
and
49
of
the
appendix.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
entire
proceeding
is
--
is
found
at
pages
48
and
49.
the
witness
then
--
this
sole
eyewitness
then
heard
the
prosecutor
to
tell
the
judge
that
certain
items
taken
from
her
home
at
the
time
of
the
assault,
at
the
time
the
crime
had
committed
upon
--
--
had
been
committed
upon
her,
were
recovered
from
the
petitioner’s
apartment
when
he
was
arrested.
that
statement
was
wholly
untrue.
the
prosecutor’s
next
statement
was
that
the
clothing
of
her
assailant
was
recovered
from
the
petitioner’s
apartment
when
he
was
arrested.
none
of
that
clothing
was
ever
introduced
in
evidence
in
course
of
the
trial
of
this
case.
these
statements
were
then
immediately
followed
by
the
prosecutor
asking
the
witness
to
identify
the
petitioner
as
her
assailant
which
she
did.
the
critical
nature
of
this
proceeding
in
this
case,
the
identification
procedure
in
this
case
is
emphasized
by
what
we
believe
just
the
lack
of
other
reliable
evidence.
for
example,
at
the
time
subsequent
to
the
assault,
the
complainant
victim
advised
the
police
to
look
on
a
file
box
that
was
in
the
apartment
for
fingerprints.
they
did
in
fact
find
a
fingerprint.
they
compared
that
fingerprint
with
that
of
the
petitioner
and
it
was
not
his.
the
clothing,
certain
clothing
taken
from
him
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
that
--
that
clothing
included
a
pair
of
trousers.
the
fly
area
as
well
as
the
rest
of
that
area
was
tested
by
a
chicago
police
department
lab
technician
and
that
technician
testified
that
he
found
no
semen,
no
female
cells,
no
matching
hairs
or
fibers
and
no
blood
in
the
trousers,
even
though
at
the
time
of
the
assault,
an
examination
by
doctor
a
few
hours
later
disclosed
that
she
was
menstruating.
our
major
contentions
are;
first,
that
this
indigent
petitioner
had
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
at
that
initial
court
proceeding.
at
least
the
state
we
believe
concedes
in
its
brief
that
she
had
a
right
to
counsel
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
think
that
was
treated
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
it
--
it
was
not
treated
--
there
was
--
there
were
only
two.
there
was
the
trial
and
then
the
appeal
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no.
well,
the
defense
lawyer
raised
it
during
the
motion
to
suppress
the
trial
and
in
his
argument
as
grounds
for
his
alleged
--
his
argument
that
the
line
up
was
--
the
show
up
was
so
suggested
that
it
violated
the
principles
of
wade,
gilbert
and
stovall.
it
was
alleged
in
that
sense.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
it
was
not
pursued
as
such
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
terms
of
right
to
counsel,
no
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
are
--
clearly
the
issue
of
violation
of
wade,
stovall
and
gilbert
is
--
was
raised
in
the
state
--
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
suggestivity
of
right
to
counsel
was
raised.
i
mean,
the
suggestivity
of
the
confrontation
was
raised.
although
the
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
trial
of
the
proceeding
as
i
said
in
the
state
court,
the
issue
of
lack
--
absence
of
right
--
lack
of
right
to
counsel
was
--
was
brought
out
by
the
--
by
the
defense
lawyer.
when
the
case
got
to
the
federal
district
court,
it
got
there
because
the
petitioner
filed
his
pro
se
habeas
corpus
petition
and
in
that
petition,
he
alleged,
suggesting
this,
he
alleged
that
the
show
up
was
conducted
in
violation
of
the
principles
of
wade,
gilbert
and
stovall
and
he
also
alleged
that
his
--
the
conviction
was
tainted
by
the
prosecution’s
untrue
statements
which
were
not
available
to
his
counsel
at
the
time
because
his
counsel
was
denied
a
transcript
of
that
initial
court
proceeding
and
the
seventh
--
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
he
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies
and
not
filed
illinois
habeas
on
post
convenient
--
post
conviction
proceeding
petition.
the
seventh
circuit
said
we
believe
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
has
made
sufficient
allegations
to
make
it
clear
that
he
is
now
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
or
at
least
a
decision
in
the
district
court
with
respect
of
all
the
events
which
led
up
to
his
conviction
in
terms
of
the
ideas
of
suggestibility,
the
ideas
of
violation
of
wade,
gilbert
and
stovall.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
first
one
was
a
group
of
about
200
from
which
she
selected
people
who
had
the
general
--
physical
characteristics
of
--
of
the
person
that
she
--
that
she
described
as
her
assailant.
it
was
not
intended
to
pick
out
any
person
and
she
clearly
did
not.
the
second
show
up
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
purpose
apparently
was
to
narrow
down
as
much
as
possible,
the
number
of
possible
suspects.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
i
presume
that
one
of
the
police’s
interest
--
one
of
the
police
interest
was
to
have
her
make
an
identification
if
possible,
but
it
was
clear
in
her
mind
and
i
think
clear
on
the
detective’s
testimony
because
they
testified
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
identification
at
trial
that
essentially
that
viewing
was
of
a
large
number,
it
was
almost
like
the
police
folder
book
which
in
some
jurisdictions
is
kept
in
the
police’s
station.
it
was
a
folder
or
--
mug
book
--
mug
shot
book.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
some
200
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
200,
probably
200
different
people,
yes
sir.
although
the
record
does
not
indicate,
but
probably
to
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
then
the
second
one
she
was
shown
approximately
between
9
and
12.
the
record
i
think
would
indicate
that
there
were
not.
at
that
time.
i
think
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
she
never
identified
any
one
person.
she
did
pick
out
three
which
she
said
had
similar
physical
characteristics
to
her
assailant,
but
i
think
her
testimony
ultimately
was,
i
did
not
make
an
identification
of
any
person
from
a
photograph.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
this
photograph
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
police
sargent,
i
mean,
the
detective
investigating
the
case
said
that
it
was
so
included;
however
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
only
in
the
subsequent
as
far
as
we
know,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
sir.
however,
we
do
not
know
which
9
to
12
were
shown
to
her
because
the
police
department
did
not
mark
them
in
anyway
at
the
time
they
were
shown.
so
when
the
case,
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
identification
came
up
in
the
trial
court,
the
police
--
the
detective
said
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
i
am
pretty
sure,
i
am
reasonably
sure
that
some
of
these
or
these
are
the
photographs
that
were
shown
to
her
when
we
were
showing
her
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
she
picked
out
three
of
the
nine
or
so
then
she
said
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
parson
me
sir?
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
his
was
one
of
the
three.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
i
would
--
i
believe
that
--
although
we
cannot
be
sure
which
ones
she
was
shown
because
the
detectives
were
not
sure.
detectives
were
reasonably
sure
that
she
had
seen
three
of
those
before.
the
other
six
they
were
unsure.
she
was
not
sure
which
one
she
had
seen
before.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
she
was
not
even
sure
with
the
one
that
she
--
she
had
then
--
that
was
shown
her
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
one
that
did
in
fact
have
the
petitioner’s
picture
on
it,
she
was
not
certain
whether
or
not
that
was
the
photograph
she
had
been
shown
by
the
detective
previously
in
the
police
station
during
that
week.
it
is
possible
that
one
or
more
of
those
12
had
beards.
of
the
three
that
she
picked
out,
persons
having
similar
physical
characteristics
narrowed
it
down
to
three
as
having
similar
characteristics
without
saying
any
of
those
three
were
one.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
your
honor
i
--
i
would
--
i
--
my
best
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
of
those
of
nine
or
so
perhaps
one
or
more
had
some
facial
hair.
we
do
not
know,
but
perhaps
one
or
more.
of
the
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
if
you
--
if
you
read
the
record,
including
her
testimony,
both
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
during
the
trial
and
finally
including
a
portion
of
the
testimony
and
redirect
examination
by
the
state’s
attorney,
she
makes
it
clear
that
she
was
not
identifying
any
person
when
she
picked
out
those
three
photographs.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
believe
that
of
the
9
she
saw
at
the
second
viewing.
she
did
in
fact
state
that
she
picked
out
three
of
those
9
as
having
similar
physical
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
correct.
only
one
of
which
had
a
beard,
the
other
two
did
not.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
record
shows
of
the
three
that
she
picked
out
as
being
persons
of
similar
physical
characteristics,
one
of
those
three
had
beard.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
was
this
petitioner.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
other
two
did
not
have
beard,
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
was
his
testimony,
her
testimony
is
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
two
state
courts
and
two
federal
courts,
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
but
the
record
that
they
based
it
on
was
the
record
that
we
are
here
arguing
has
constitutional
significance
of
the
issues.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
think
their
finding
of
fact
is
necessarily
entitled
to
any
more
or
less
--
they
did
not
make
any
findings
of
fact,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
and
the
record
--
the
district
court
made
its
findings
based
on
the
record,
the
same
record
that
was
available
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
before
the
jury
she
did
so
identify,
yes
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
with
respect
to
my
--
my
second
and
third
points.
as
i
stated,
we
believe
that
at
that
proceeding,
as
far
as
point
number
one
is
concerned,
that
formal,
initial
--
initial
formal
criminal
judicial
proceedings
had
in
fact
been
instituted
and
under
kirby,
wade
versus
united
states
and
gilbert
versus
california
that
our
petitioner
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
that
initial
contention.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
believe
they
have,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
brief
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
believe
that
is
right.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
not
specifically
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
that
evidence,
there
has
not
been
and
that
evidence,
the
evidence
of
that
confrontation,
in
fact
went
into
evidence
in
the
state’s
case.
the
identification
unless
that
it
was
not
merely,
ms.
witness,
do
you
see
the
person
in-court
that
committed
the
crime
upon
you
or
words
to
that
effect,
but
the
state
also
in
its
direct
examination
of
the
witness
dwelled
at
length
upon
this
initial
in-court
confrontation
and
identification.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
one
of
our
claims,
but
we
would
say
independently
of
that
judge
--
your
honor,
independently
of
that,
that
when
--
when
we
are
talking
about
identification,
eyewitness
identification,
the
linchpin
i
think
this
court
called
it
,
of
that
is
its
reliability.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
believe
that
it
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
think
that
that
is
so
because
the
right
to
counsel
is
such
an
integral
part
of
the
fact
finding
process.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
suggest
there
is
just
no
doubt
or
question
at
all
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
think
that
is
clear.
although
kirby
uses
the
word
indictment.
we
think
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
right
and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
if
i
just
make
it
back
a
little
bit
to
the
concept
of
reliability
because
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
identification.
i
think,
the
thing
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
is
that
defense
counsel
never
knew
about
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
we
think
that
that
is
what
gilbert
held,
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
as
far
as
we
know,
no
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no
sir.
they
were
never
found
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
--
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
assistant
state
attorney
who
made
those
statements
said
in
substance
in
an
affidavit
which
the
court
apparently
considered
in
terms
of
arriving
at
its
decision
and
in
its
opinion
that
if
the
statements
were
untrue,
they
were
--
they
were
not
made
with
any
intent
--
with
knowledge
of
their
falsity
and
that
if
he
made
them
--
that
at
the
time
he
made
them,
he
made
them
thinking
they
were
true,
because
apparently
what
happened
was
very
simply,
they
recovered
two
musical
instruments
from
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
--
a
guitar
and
a
flute.
it
happened
that
the
--
the
victim
of
the
crime
had
a
guitar
and
a
flute
taken
from
her,
but
they
were
not
the
same
items.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
they
both
happen
to
possess
musical
instruments,
yes
sir.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no
sir,
he
was
not
brought
the
attention
of
the
triers.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
our
position
was
that
it
has
a
great
bearing
on
reliability
because
the
triers
of
the
fact
are
the
ones
who
determine
the
reliability.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
right,
and
therefore,
they
could
not
calculate
into
their
cons
--
their
evaluation
of
the
witness'
reliability.
the
very
suggestive
and
impressive
confrontation
which
was
never
brought
to
their
attention,
as
was
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
during
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
it
was
not
brought
to
their
attention
because
the
defense
lawyer
had
been
denied
the
--
the
transcript.
so
he
did
not
know
that
those
statements
have
been
made
and
he
at
no
time
was
able
to
plum
into
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
trial
judge
or
the
jury,
their
suggestibility
to
ask
the
witness
whether
or
not
they
in
fact
had
affected
her
--
her
ability
to
make
a
fair
eye
witness
identification.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
a
complaint
which
is
the
way
99
and
nine-tenths
percents
of
criminal
cases
commence
in
the
–
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes
sir
and
filed
in
the
court
and
he
was
in
custody,
not
of
the
chicago
police
department
anymore,
but
in
the
custody
of
the
bailiff.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
on
this
charge.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
it
was
i
guess
at
best,
his
initial
court
appearance
would
be
--
illinois
as
far
as
i
know
has
no
formal
term
for
that.
it
is
the
first
time
a
person
is
brought
into
court.
in
illinois
if
you
are
arrested
and
cannot
make
bail
because
of
felony
case
bail
is
always
--
it
is
almost
always
set
unless
you
are
arrested
within
a
few
hours
of
the
court
time.
you
are
brought
to
court
the
next
morning.
if
you
make
bail
at
the
police
station,
you
are
released
and
a
court
date
is
set
for
you
sometime
in
the
future.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
was
--
a
finding
of
probable
cause
could
well
have
been
made
that
day.
the
judge
asked
the
defense
lawyer,
i
mean,
the
defendant
i
am
sorry,
there
was
no
defense
lawyer,
if
he
was
ready
for
hearing
and
before
the
petitioner
could
answer
the
state’s
attorney
then
make
the
statement
–
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
think
that
the
record
indicates
he
was
arrested
because
they
--
they
found
a
--
a
letter
which
they
believe
tied
him
in
to
the
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
it
is
unclear
whether
or
not
there
was
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
it
is
not
normal.
what
will
happen
--
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
in
this
case
an
arrest
warrant
was
issued
by
a
judge.
the
state's
attorney
said
there
was.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
seven
years
--
eight
--
nine
years
later,
judge
when
we
got
the
case,
we
subpoenaed
the
police
records
and
the
clerk’s
records.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
except
for
some
language
of
the
state's
attorney’s
office
the
record
is
bare
in
that
regard.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
they
found
a
letter,
yes
sir
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
issue.
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
admit
it
or
deny
it.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
no,
what
--
we
tried
to
find
out
your
honor,
when
we
got
in
the
case
because
we
did
not
represent
him
in
the
trial.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
and
we
subpoenaed
all
the
records
and
we
--
there
were
no
record
available
of
any
arrest
warrant
issued
for
him
and
we
had
sketchy
and
excerpts
from
the
police
reports.
the
rest
of
the
materials
or
police
documents
had
already
been
destroyed
and
a
search
by
the
clerk’s
office
pursuant
to
subpoena
came
up
with
no
arrest
warrant.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
during
the
--
at
the
trial,
there
was
not
admitted
into
evidence.
a
checkbook
like
document
and
checkbook
i
guess
would
be
the
best
description,
although
apparently
it
did
not
have
any
checks
in
it.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
would
be
think
it
would
be
the
size
like
most
people
carry
that
carries
checks.
in
that
book
was
a
letter
from
a
woman
to
her
psychiatrist.
that
book
was
found
in
the
--
in
the
apartment
of
the
victim.
the
police
--
when
she
got
--
after
the
assault,
she
went
to
pick
up
that
book
thinking
it
was
hers
and
when
she
looked
in
she
expected
to
find
$60
or
perhaps
she
thought
that
maybe
the
assailant
had
taken
her
$60,
she
looked
at
it,
saw
the
letter
and
determined
it
was
not
her
checkbook.
so
she
turned
that
checkbook
over
to
the
police.
the
police
in
turn
contacted
apparently
the
woman
whose
letter
it
was
and
made
some
association
between
that
woman
and
the
petitioner
and
that
is
how
they
came
to
arrest
the
petitioner.
i
believe,
but
i
am
not
sure
because
the
record
does
not
contain
all
of
the
issues
with
respect
to
probable
cause.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
mr.
moore
--
that
the
woman
who
wrote
the
letter
had
been
his
girlfriend
up
until
a
day
or
so
before
the
alleged
rape.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes
sir
–-
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
think,
it
maybe
your
honor,
but
two
things;
number
one
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
the
jury
could
infer
that,
but
if
i
just
may
recite
the
evidence;
the
petitioner
introduced
evidence
indicating
he
had
lost
that
book
the
night
before
in
a
bar,
a
bar
where
he
had
concededly
met
and
talked
briefly
with
the
victim
in
this
case.
when
she
woke
up
--
i
mean,
sorry
not
woke
up
--
after
the
assault
when
she
went
to
pick
it
up,
she
thought
it
was
hers.
she
might
well
have
picked
it
up
that
night
he
lost
it
and
brought
it
home
thinking
it
was
hers,
but
--
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
certainly,
they
would
have
the
right
to
assume
that,
but
i
think
your
honor,
again
when
we
are
talking
about
reliability,
we
are
not
talking
about
it
in
terms
of
other
collaborating
evidence
in
order
to
determine
whether
somebody
committed
a
crime.
reliability
of
an
identification
means,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
identification
and
that
is
all.
for
example,
the
same
way
as
right
to
counsel
does
not
mean,
even
when
somebody
--
when
the
--
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
we
can
convict
them
without
a
lawyer,
if
they
do
not
intelligently
waive
the
right
to
a
lawyer
and
i
think
the
same
analogy
applies
here.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
i
think
ours
is
the
right
to
counsel
and
that
is
suggestive
confrontation
only,
due
process
for
--
and
i
think
they
are
different.
mr.
patrick
j.
hughes,
jr.
yes,
but
even
if
it
--
if
it
did,
we
think
on
the
--
in
the
record
in
this
case,
we
would
still
survive
any
examination
in
light
of
the
fact
mason.
thank
you.
