justice

you
say
the
state
concedes
that
point
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
part
of
your
contention
that
assuming
that
you
did
have
a
right
to
counsel
that
the
--
that
the
testimony
--
that
the
in-court
testimony
about
the
out
of
court
pretrial
identification
was
per
se
excludable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
and
there
has
been
no
--
let
us
assume
that
that
testimony
about
the
out
of
court
identification
was
automatically
excludable
without
showing
any
taint
or
any
undue
suggestion
that
suggests
the
fact
that
there
was
no
counsel.
assume
that
there
has
been
no
finding
of
harmless
error
in
this
case
with
respect
to
that
evidence,
has
there?
there
has
been
no
--
i
--
if
there
is
a
finding
of
harmless
error,
i
would
like
to
know
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
comments
are
--
seem
to
be
premised
on
the
assertion
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
at
this
hearing
that
took
place
and
i
take
it
your
brief
indicates
that
you
or
at
least
you
assume
there
is
a
right
to
counsel.
what
do
you
think
the
right
to
counsel
dead
attach
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
under
wade
or
gilbert,
you
think
the
right
to
counsel
that
did
--
had
attached
and
that
there
was
a
violation
of
it
and
you
just
argue
about
whether
what
the
consequences
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
what
is
--
what
is
your
position?
let
us
say
what
is
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
about
whether
they
apply
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
that
that
--
that
at
this
hearing
no
right
to
counsel
had
attached
at
all
and
so
wade
and
gilbert
had
not
--
had
no
applicability
at
all,
is
that
your
position
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did
not
make
that
argument
in
the
brief.
you
seem
to
concede
the
right
to
counsel,
at
least
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
lower
court
has
ever
addressed
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levad,
i
do
not
quite
understand
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
per
se
rule,
the
automatic
exclusionary
rule
of
wade
and
gilbert
applies
only
to
the
testimony
about
the
out
of
court
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
certainly
does
not
apply
to
the
in-court
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
found
that
there
is
an
independent
basis
and
i
take
it
that
that
is
equivalent
to
finding
no
taint
on
the
--
in
connection
with
the
in-court
identification
caused
by
the
out
of
court.
so
as
you
are
talking
about
the
harmless
error
rule,
unless
we
are
going
to
review
and
overturn
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
there
was
an
independent
basis,
it
leaves
the
in-court
identification
as
--
as
perhaps
the
most
important
piece
of
the
evidence
that
--
that
is
advancing
the
petitioner
to
the
crime
and
--
the
only
thing
is
going
to
be
reversed
is
the
--
if
anything
is
going
to
be
reversed,
if
is
the
only
thing
going
to
be
reversed
is
the
testimony
about
the
out
of
court
identification,
it
would
leave
a
major
part
of
your
case?
