mr.
charles
h.
levad
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
initially,
some
of
the
factual
allegations
that
were
made
by
mr.
hughes
and
maybe
i
can
clear
up
some
of
the
factual
problems
that
are
in
the
record
at
this
point.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
hearing,
it
was
held
on
december
21st
1967.
i
think
it
--
it
appears
from
the
record
and
under
illinois
law,
the
first
time
an
individual
appears
before
the
court
is
for
setting
a
bond
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
complaint
was
filed
prior
to
arrest,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
happens
even
if
no
complaint
has
been
filed.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
--
generally
a
complaint
is
filed
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
purpose
is
to
set
bond.
on
a
complaint
filed
prior
to
the
arrest,
a
tentative
bond
is
set,
but
you
are
still
brought
before
the
court
to
--
for
a
bond
hearing.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
apparently
it
was
not
your
honor,
no.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
will
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not,
i
can
your
honor
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
i
do
not
think
it
is
entirely
clear
from
the
record
as
to
whether
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
in
that,
but
i
think
the
record
does
any
indicate
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
whether
there
was
a
warrant
at
that
time
or
not.
prior
to
the
arrest,
the
detectives,
the
police
detectives
had
the
ladder,
which
was
explained
by
mr.
hughes
and
if
i
may
amplify
on
that
a
little
bit,
i
--
there
was
--
it
was
stipulated
at
trial,
that
the
suspect,
mr.
moore
had
obtained
that
letter
from
the
girl's
apartment
and
i
think
and
it
appeared
on
miss
miller's
floor
immediately
after
the
rape.
i
think
the
jury
and
the
police
officers,
the
jury
later
and
the
police
officers
at
that
time
could
--
could
infer
and
use
that
as
the
basis
for
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
no,
i
am
not
saying
it
is
unimportant,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
is
never
--
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
has
never
been
shown
below
in
a
state
courts
or
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
no,
it
was
necessary
to
file
a
complaint,
anyway.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
your
honor
and
when
a
arrest
is
made
prior
to
filing
complaint,
illinois
law
requires
it
to
be
filed
as
fast
as
possible.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
it
is,
yes
it
is.
i
might
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
were
other
--
other
individuals,
strike
that.
the
further
identification
that
was
made
in
which
mr.
hughes
discussed,
i
maintain
was
an
identification
prior
to
this
--
this
bond
hearing.
the
record
indicates,
primarily
during
the
motion
to
suppress
that
ms.
miller
indicated
that
she
did
identify
one
individual
from
the
9
that
were
shown
to
her
that
--
that
testimony
is
on
page
155
of
the
record,
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
pardon?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
it
is
page
68
of
the
appendix.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes.
that
was
presented
by
detective
joseph
wazlowski
who
apparently
was
present
when
she
did
pick
out
that
photograph
of
the
defendant.
however,
indicative
i
think
of
what
happened
during
this
identification
process,
ms.
miller
when
she
picked
up
that
photograph,
did
not
say
that
is
the
man,
she
did
not
say
that
is
the
man
who
raped
me.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
she
said,
it
looks
like
the
man,
but
i
would
like
to
see
him
in
person
and
i
think
did
indicate
that
she
was
using
some
care
in
the
identification.
i
think
the
first
photo,
photo
spread
that
were
shown
to
ms.
miller,
the
spread
of
200
also
indicated
that
they
were
using
great
care
in
going
about
this
identification.
the
--
i
might
point
out
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
after
reviewing
the
record,
saw
the
identification
made
at
the
december
21st
hearing
as
merely
a
confirmation
of
a
previous
identification
that
she
--
that
ms.
miller
had
made
during
the
photographic
process
when
she
was
shown
the
photographic
spread.
now,
it
should
be
noted
and
i
think
perhaps
where
some
of
the
confusion
has
come
up
during
this
or
with
regard
to
this
question
is
that
ms.
miller
apparently
isolated
three
photographs
from
the
9
initially.
there
was
testimony
that
the
defendant's
photograph
was
the
only
one
with
a
beard,
but
on
page
--
well
strike
that
--
but
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
and
i
believe
that
is
the
same
page
155
of
the
record,
68
of
the
abstract
that
the
defendant's
--
the
defendant's
photograph
was
not
the
only
photograph
in
that
spread
of
9
that
had
a
beard.
he
was
the
only
of
the
3
which
she
initially
isolated
that
had
a
beard.
mr.
hughes
indicated
also
that
no
finger
prints
or
any
finger
print
was
found
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
it
was
not
that
of
the
defendant
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
defendant's
pants
when
they
were
examined.
i
might
point
out
that
this
does
negate
his
guilt,
but
merely
indicates
that
--
that
the
evidence
was
absent
or
any
evidence
--
any
evidence
that
may
have
been
there
was
not
at
the
time
that
it
was
checked.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
the
issue
and
i
might
point
out
that
gilbert
has
decided
back
in
1967
by
this
court
and
at
that
time
the
court
stated
--
stated
the
balancing
test
that
has
been
used
by
this
court
on
number
of
occasions.
most
recently
in
identification
cases
in
neil
versus
biggers
and
manson
versus
brathwaite
and
the
court
stated
if
i
may
quote
two
lines;
“the
desirability
of
detouring
the
constitutionally
objectionable
practice
must
prevail
over
the
undesirability
of
excluding
relevant
evidence.”
that
rule
in
gilbert
was
annunciated
that
time
without
any
comment
of
the
factors
that
court
was
weighing
about
the
alternatives
that
the
court
was
rejecting
at
that
time.
i
think
that
--
that
rule
was
a
mistake.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
doubt
in
this
case,
your
honor
that
the
confrontation
that
occurred
on
december
21st,
1967
was
in
the
midst
or
after
the
institution
of
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
if
wade
and
gilbert
apply
to
this
case,
as
this
is
lineup
as
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
my
position,
your
honor
is
this
that
there
was
a
prior
identification
in
this
case.
the
--
the
photographs,
the
photographic
identification
was
one
in
which
the
victim
in
the
case
picked
out
a
particular
individual,
using
a
great
deal
of
care
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
if
wade
and
gilbert
and
i
maintain
it
that
they
do
not,
if
they
apply
to
this
type
of
situation
where
an
individual
was
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
this
is
--
i
am
getting
to
that
your
honor.
there
was
a
prior
identification.
individual
is
identified.
there
was
other
evidence
against
him.
based
upon
that
a
criminal
complaint
was
filed
and
he
was
brought
into
court
and
at
some
point
during
the
--
during
the
legal
proceedings
against
him,
the
defendant
would
be
confronted
by
his
accuser.
he
has
perfect
right
to
that
and
--
and
in
this
case
it
happened
on
his
initial
appearance
in-court.
the
--
the
proceeding
itself
as
a
bond
hearing.
it
is
common
to
show
some
evidence
against
the
defendant
in
a
bond
hearing
from
purpose
of
setting
bond
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
all
this
warrants.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not
recall
that
from
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
she
did
sign
on
that
day,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
is
normal
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
the
record
indicates
why
she
did
not
sign
until
that
day.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
one
of
my
arguments,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
the
right
to
counsel
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
well,
i
conceded
your
honor.
i
think
and
what
meant
by
the
concession
and
if
i
have
gone
farther
than
that,
i
apologize
that
a
criminal
proceeding
had
--
had
been
instituted.
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
question
of
that.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
if
this
was
a
lineup
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not
think
it
is
anything
near
a
lineup
or
what
ordinarily
one
would
call
a
lineup.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
no
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
it
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
primarily
what
i
am
asking
this
court
is
to
reexamine
the
gilbert
versus
california.
i
think
a
recent
decision
in
manson
versus
brathwaite
does
have
a
very
--
very
definite
impact
on
this
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
approach
to
pretrial
identification
testimony
was
challenged
on
due
process
grounds
is
to
be
subjected
to
the
test
of
its
reliability
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
same
situation
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
no,
i
have
not
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
think
we
would
have
that
opportunity
to.
yes,
i
am
arguing
also
that
was
harmless
error
your
honor,
alternatively
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
harmless
error
issue?
not
as
such
your
honor
because
the
rulings
were
in
favor
of
the
state
in
each
case
below,
in
each
of
the
four
courts.
pardon?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
essentially
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
this
was
a
--
a
lineup
which
would
fall
under
wade-gilbert.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
well,
i
am
--
what
i
am
saying
is
i
think
wade-gilbert
does
apply
to
the
extent
that
if
this
was
a
lineup
--
a
lineup
or
an
identification
proceeding
as
covered
by
wade-gilbert
then
a
wade-gilbert
violation
does
occur.
i
do
not
think
i
am
taking
the
contrary
position.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
no
it
does
not
that
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
first
of
all,
the
wade-gilbert,
wade-gilbert
rules
and
remedy
that
gilbert
applied
to
the
in-court
identification
were
applied
in
that
case
to
a
post
indictment
situation.
in
kirby
versus
illinois,
the
court
rejected
that
rule
and
that
remedy
for
--
for
the
situation
where
the
confrontation
occurs
prior
to
institution
of
any
criminal
charge,
indicating
by
dicta
that
the
right
accrues
after
institution
of
a
criminal
charge.
this
court
has
never
held
that
gilbert
applies
to
a
pre-indictment
situation.
i
am
not
arguing,
i
am
urging
the
court
not
the
extend
the
gilbert
rule
to
cover
any
more
situations
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
reexamine
that
rule
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
manson
versus
brathwaite
and
neil
versus
biggers.
in
both
those
cases,
the
court
was
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
testimony,
testimony
of
a
pretrial
identification.
the
court
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
true.
that
is
my
first
claim
your
honor.
alternatively,
if
this
is
a
lineup
that
the
court
would
hold
except
in
wade-gilbert
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
purpose
of
a
lineup
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
proceedings
that
the
wade-gilbert-stovall
trilogy
would
concerned
with
were
proceedings
during
which
evidence
was
to
be
obtained
to
be
used
in
the
trial,
identification
evidence
in
which
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
whether
that
evidence
would
accrue
out
of
that
--
those
proceedings.
in
this
case,
we
already
had
an
identification.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
illinois
supreme
court
specifically
said
this
only
confirmed
a
prior
identification
and
it
was
--
it
was
introduced
as
evidence
going
to
the
--
going
to
the
amount
of
bond
that
should
be
set,
it
was
like
a
mini
preliminary
hearing,
but
it
was
part
of
a
judicial
proceeding
and
it
was
--
it
was
--
there
was
not
a
doubt
i
do
not
think
prior
to
this
that
there
would
be
--
or
not
great
doubt
that
there
would
be
an
identification.
the
other
evidence
had
been
--
had
been
obtained.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
setting
bond
your
honor,
the
proceeding
itself.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
as
testimony
and
as
evidence
to
be
introduced
in
a
bond
hearing
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
was
her
purpose
for
being
there,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
purpose
of
the
lineup
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
is
to
identify,
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
difference
is
that
prior
--
lineups
prior
to
--
prior
to
trial,
have
as
their
purpose
of
the
obtaining
of
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
to
be
used
at
trial
and
to
be
used
at
judicial
proceedings
prior
to
trial
and
this
was
the
use
of
that
evidence.
that
was
the
difference.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
am
not
quite
sure
understand
the
question.
a
lineup
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
--
in
a
magistrate's
office?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
would
--
no
i
do
not
contend
that
you
would
not
--
that
it
would
not
be
subject
to
wade-gilbert
and
there
would
not
be
a
right
to
counsel.
however
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
this
is
after
charge
or
prior
to
charge,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
the
--
the
record
indicates
that
she
filed
--
she
signed
a
complaint
and
was
filed
prior
to
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
just
prior
to
the
hearing,
i
believe
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
as
part
of
that
hearing,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
there
was
no
lawyer
present,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes,
she
did
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
to
the
extent
that
gilbert
versus
california
may
apply
to
this
case,
your
honor,
yes
it
would
--
it
would
directly
fall
under
u.s.
versus
wade
in
which
the
only
testimony
that
is
used
in
the
trial
is
the
in-court
identification
and
even
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.

that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
was
a
jury
trial.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
did
come
in
at
the
trial,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
it
is
--
part
of
it
is
on
page
75
of
the
abstract
where
it
indicates,
record
page
234,
did
you
know
at
that
--
at
the
time
realm
that
he
stepped
out
of
that
door
that
he
was
james
moore.
jesus
i
knew,
he
was
the
man
that
raped
me
and
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
--
referring
to
that.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
conviction
does
not
stand
alone
on
the
identification,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
suggest
that
that
they
--
they
could
have
and
probably
did
rely
on
that
two
equivalent
step?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
the
only
other
evidence
than
the
identification
your
honor
is
the
letter
to
my
--
to
my
recollection
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
it
is.
the
letter
apparently
was
inside
the
checkbook.
maybe
i
will
clear
that
up
a
little
bit.
the
letter
was
a
letter
that
was
written
by
the
girl
that
testified,
who
testified
that
she
had
gone
with
the
defendant
and
it
was
written
to
her
doctor
and
was
kept
in
that
checkbook
and
the
last
time
she
saw
it
was
two
days
prior
to
the
--
to
this
incident
on
december
12th,
1967
and
on
that
day
she
gave
mr.
moore
the
keys
to
her
apartment
to
remove
some
of
his
possessions.
the
next
time
that
letter
showed
up
was
in
miss
miller's
apartment,
right
after
the
rape,
on
the
floor,
beside
the
bed.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
is
the
letter
the
most
important
factual
element?
mr.
charles
h.
levad
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
a
very
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
that
that
in-court
identification
is
important
to
that
determination
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
--
is
important
to
that
determination
and
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
that
identification
and
that
determination
has
been
reviewed
by
three
separate
courts
below.
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
she
picked
him
out
of
a
line
and
she
picked
him
out
as
he
walked
in
the
courtroom.
as
she
testified
--
mr.
charles
h.
levad
she
knew
that
it
was
the
individual
that
had
been
charged
in
the
case,
but
she
also
testified
that
that
was
not
a
fact
of
contributing
to
--
to
her
identification.
she
said
when
he
walked
through
the
door,
i
knew
that
was
the
man
that
raped
me.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
at
least
one.
mr.
charles
h.
levad
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
