chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first
case
on
for
argument
this
morning
is
number
76-5344,
moore
against
illinois.
mr.
hughes
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
courts
have
reviewed
this
case
now,
four;
two
state
courts
and
two
federal
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
found
any
errors
that
occurred
in
the
trial
to
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
day
of
the
trial
in
the
courtroom,
did
she
identify
this
defendant,
the
appellant
here
as
the
attacker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
got
difficulty
focusing
or
finding
a
focus
on
this
matter
of
the
address
book.
can
you
shed
some
light
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
pocket
checkbooks
type?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
was
the
--
what
was
the
linkage
between
that
book
and
moore,
the
petitioner
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
some
reference
in
the
brief
if
not
in
the
record,
that
on
the
following
day
or
shortly
after
the
attack,
he
went
to
the
bar
inquiring
about
the
existence
whether
that
checkbook
had
been
found
in
the
bar,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
some
linkage
between
him
and
his
possible
presence
in
that
room,
that
night?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way.
do
you
think
the
jury
hearing
that,
could
reasonably
infer
that
he
had
been
in
that
room
at
sometime
and
had
dropped
that
checkbook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
are
confronted
now
with
what
the
jury
would
reasonably
had
a
right
to
believe.
would
the
jury,
i
think
you
have
indicated
that
jury
would
have
the
right
to
infer
from
that
evidence
that
if
his
property
was
found
in
the
room
of
the
victim,
that
perhaps
he
too
had
been
there.
would
they
have
a
right
to
assume
to
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hughes.
mr.
levad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
that
this
identification
that
you
have
in
case,
the
same
kind
of
an
identification
as
is
made
--
as
was
as
made
in
open
court
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
your
argument
is
that
it
was
not
a
lineup
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
typical
lineup
with
ten
people
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levad,
if
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
suggested
to
you,
the
question
to
the
position
of
line
on
harmless
error,
which
has
not
been
treated
by
the
other
courts,
reviewing
courts,
then
is
it
harmless
error
because
moore's
property
was
found
in
her
room
and
the
jury
has
resolved
that
issue,
is
that
--
is
there
anything
else
beside
that
that
would
link
him
with
the
crime
other
than
taking
the
identification
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
--
you
do
not
suggest
that
the
jury
did
not
rely
on
the
fact
to
some
extent
that
his
checkbook
was
found
in
the
victim's
room,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
is
a
harmless
error
case
which
none
of
the
hearing
courts
said
it
was,
is
there
any
other
evidence
that
it
is
harmless
or
better
evidence
than
that?
what
else
would
you
rely
on
to
--
to
make
a
harmless
error
case,
if
that
is
really
what
you
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
letter
is
part
of
the
--
tied
in
with
the
checkbook,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
are
leaning,
if
not
rely
on
harmless
error,
is
that
not
the
most
important
factual
element
in
this
case,
assuming
you
are
in
a
position
to
raise
harmless
error
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
checkbook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-5344
moore
against
illinois,
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
