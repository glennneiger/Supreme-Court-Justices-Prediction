justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
the
footnote
on
page
8
of
the
state's
brief,
as
i
read
it,
you
state
that
despite
wade
reservations
and
then
wade-gilbert,
you
go
on
to
say
respondent
will
concede
to
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
that
a
wade-gilbert
violation
occurred
at
this
preliminary
proceedings.
now,
is
that
your
present
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
quite
understand
that.
are
you
--
are
you
taking
the
position
in
argument
here
today
a
contrary
to
the
footnote
that
wade-gilbert
does
not
apply?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
does
not
that
footnote
concession
to
which
mr.
justice
powell
has
referred
drive
you
to
a
harmless
error
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
levad?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
trial
itself.
the
prosecutor
testified
at
the
trial
that
she
had
previously
identified
this
defendant
at
this
preliminary
hearing,
however
you
may
characterize
it,
did
she
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
your
case
be
any
stronger
or
any
different,
if
she
had
not
referred
back
to
that
prior
identification,
but
had
merely
confined
herself
to
am
in-court
identification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
--
then
you
have
an
obligation
to
try
to
prove
some
independent
source,
would
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
problem
stems
primarily
from
gilbert?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
laid
down
the
per
se
rule?
