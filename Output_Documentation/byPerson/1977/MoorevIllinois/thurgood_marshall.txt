does
the

show
that

thurgood
marshall
well
who

--
you
mean
you
can
pick
up
man
without
anybody
signing
the
complaint
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
normal
in
illinois,
you
just
walk
out
and
pick
a
man
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
why
he
was
originally
picked
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
not
you
think
this
is
a
matter
of
--
if
this
guy
--
man
ended
up
in
custody?
well,
i
am
interested
if
nobody
else
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
know
why
this
man
was
in
custody.
the
woman
had
not
signed
the

and
she
had
refused
to
sign
it
and
yet
he
is
in
custody
and
i
would
like
to

why.
if
you
do
not
it
is
alright,
but

justice
thurgood
marshall

did
not
by
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
complaint
was
not
filed
before

justice
thurgood
marshall
apparently

was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

was
he
arrested,
stick
to
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
a
being
critical,
but
on
that
basis
you
say
it
is
unimportant
as
to
who
did
actually
lead
the
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
right,
right,
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
that
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting

after
he
was
arrested
was
just
an
abundance
of
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
it
was,
okay,
but
under
illinois
law
at
some
time,
they
had
to
file
the
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
true
that
she
did
not
want
to
sign
a
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
she
did
not
sign
it
until
that
day,
did
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
not
normal
that
after
she
identifies
somebody
you

the
complaint,
is
that
not
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
that
she
did
not
sign
until
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall

is
your
position
that
you
would
need

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you

in
trouble
here?

charge
that
