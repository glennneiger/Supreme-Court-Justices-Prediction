stewart
prior
--
prior
to
this
courtroom
episode,
there
have
been
at
least
two,
i
guess
there
were
two
opportunities
for
her
--
exhibits
to
her
various
photographs,
have
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happened
to
those?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
its
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
and
she
did
not,
was
--
did
not
have
as
its
purpose
any
effort
for
her
to
identify
her
assailant?
justice
potter
stewart
some
200
pictures
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
200
different
people?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
second
one?
justice
potter
stewart
there
seems
to
be
some
difference
in
understanding
as
to
whether
those
9
to
12
photos
there
was
only
one
picture
of
a
person
with
a
beard.
you
say
that
somewhere
in
your
briefs
that
only
the
picture
of
the
petitioner
depicted
a
person
with
a
beard
and
on
page
5
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
say
that
9
to
12
photos,
all
of
which
were
male
negroes,
several
of
whom
were
bearded.
now
that
is
a
matter
of
fact,
but
you
apparently
differ
as
to
what
the
facts
were?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
three
and
again
in
the
respondent's
brief
they
say
one
or
two
on
page
5
of
the
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
little
point
and
she
picked
out
one
or
two.
she
picked
out
one
or
two
as
was
said
on
page
5
referring
to
the
record
at
page
232?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
three,
they
say
here
there
is
one
or
two.
now
again
it
is
helpful
to
us
if
we
--
we
get
together
at
least
on
the
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
as
resembling
her
assailant?
justice
potter
stewart
your
basic
claim
is
that
this
is
the
violation
of
united
states
against
wade,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
not
--
does
not
the
role
of
united
states
against
wade
a
per
se
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
is
--
was
a
violation
of
that
doctrine
here
that
is
the
end
of
it,
unless
wade
is
going
to
be
reexamined,
is
that
not
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
say
that
--
the
criminal
proceedings
have
begun
against
this
person?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
under
the
kirby
qualification
or
clarification
of
wade,
it
violates
the
rule
of
united
states
against
wade?
justice
potter
stewart
kirby
said
the
initiation
of
criminal
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
uses
the
word
indictment
among
other
--
other
words?
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
serve
as
the
right
to
counsel,
it
is
relevant
whether
it
was
a
--
in
so
far
as
the
in-court
testimony
about
the
out
of
court
identification
is
concerned,
a
reliability
is
irrelevant,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
wade
or
gilbert?
justice
potter
stewart
they
both
just
happened
to
be
music
lovers?
justice
potter
stewart
was
any
of
that
statement
to
which
my
brother
powell
referred
was
not
in
any
way
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
triers
of
the
fact
on
the
trial
of
his
innocence
or
guilt,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
relevance
does
it
have?
i
mean,
what
--
what
bearing
does
it
have?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
they
did
not
know
anything
about
this
statement
that
was
made,
you
have
just
told
me?
justice
potter
stewart
now
at
the
time
of
this
courtroom
confrontation
as
you
call
it,
what
was
the
status
of
the
criminal
proceedings
against
you
client?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
been
signed
by
the
victim?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
illinois
procedure,
what
was
the
purpose
of
his
being
there
and
being
brought
before
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
he
would
been
arrested
and
a
complaint
had
been
filed,
signed
by
the
victim
and
he
was
brought
before
the
judge
and
that
was
at
that
time,
that
this
confrontation
took
place?
the
purpose
of
that
proceeding
was
to
find
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
binding
over
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
not
they
find
some
sort
of
letter
or
address
book
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
not
claim
that
there
was
an
probable
cause
to
arrest
him,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
not
an
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
now
why
was
he
there,
at
all?
he
has
been
arrested
as
a
result
of
what
and
a
complaint
has
been
filed
against
him?
justice
potter
stewart
or
does
this
happen
just
if
he
has
been
arrested,
even
if
no
complaint
has
been
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
--
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
who
has
been
arrested
is
brought
before
the
court
rather
promptly
and
the
purpose
is
to
set
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
as
i
suppose
is
filed
by
the
--
by
the
police,
by
the
arresting
officer,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
about,
it
is
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
68,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
looked
like
the
man?
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
case
really
not
parse
down
to
this
question?
in
the
wade
and
gilbert
case
cases,
it
was
held
by
this
court
that
at
a
lineup
a
--
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
and
no
evidence
of
a
lineup
identification
can
be
introduced
in
the
subsequent
criminal
trial
as
that
right
has
not
been
accorded.
i
think
that
is
more
or
less
a
correct
summary
of
the
wade
and
gilbert
rule
and
here
concededly
there
was
no
counsel
present
and
no
advice
that
he
had
the
right
to
counsel
and
is
not
the
question
whether
or
not
this
was
a
lineup
or
it
is
equivalent
because
if
it
was
then
does
not
the
wade
and
gilbert
rule
require
that
your
opponent
prevail?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
going
to
argue
now
about
--
about
whether
the
identification
was
reliable,
then
how
about
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
hearing
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
if
this
was
a
lineup
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
wade
would
not
apply,
but
your
claim
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
not
a
lineup
or
nothing
equivalent
to
a
lineup?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
trial
for
certiorari
had
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
long
before
wade
and
gilbert?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
error.
you
do
not
have
a
finding
of
harmless
error
until
you
first
have
a
finding
of
error?
justice
potter
stewart
and
neither
of
those
cases
involved
a
lineup,
wade-gilbert
is
applicable
--
that
rule
was
applicable
to
a
lineup
and
only
to
a
lineup?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
is
equivalent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
your
submission
is
that
this
case
like
manson
against
brathwaite
and
against
and
like
the
biggers
case
and
unlike
wade
and
gilbert
did
not
involve
a
lineup,
is
not
that
your
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
a
lineup
or
it
is
functionally
equivalent
than
as
a
concession
pointed
out
by
brother
powell
indicates
you
concede
there
was
a
violation
of
wade
and
gilbert?
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
with
the
trial,
was
it
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
of
the
trial
starts
on
page
--
that
is
excerpt,
53
of
the
appendix
and
goes
from
there
on
to
69
or
longer.
i
am
just
trying
to
find
the
transcript
of
introduction
of
this
evidence
of
the
prior
identification
because
that
is
really
is
critical,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
testimony
as
to
this
confrontation
at
the
bail
hearing,
where
did
that
--
that
did
come
in
at
the
trial,
you
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
somewhere
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
at
that
time
he
stepped
out
of
that
door
that
is
not
during
the
time
of
the
rape,
that
is
down
in
the
courtroom?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
i
see,
i
see
on
this
let
me
handle
that.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
