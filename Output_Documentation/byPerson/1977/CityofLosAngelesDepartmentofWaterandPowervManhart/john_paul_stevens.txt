justice

paul
stevens
mr.
dohrmann,
i
wonder
if
i
had
your
point
correct
there.
are
you
suggesting
that
if
upon
retirement,
a
retired
person
could
sell
the
annuity
that
he
or
she
would
then
be
entitled
to
a
bank
or
something
at
its
discounted
present
value?
the
bank
probably
would
not
pay
one
price
to
a
man
and
another
price
to
a
woman
if
i
make
an
individual
analysis
of
the
longevity
of
a
particular
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
manhart
case,
which
comes
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
review
a
sex
discrimination
issue.
for
many
years,
the
los
angeles
department
of
water
&
power
has
administered
pension
programs
for
its
employees.
the
cost
of
a
pension
for
the
average
retired
female
is
greater
than
for
the
average
male,
because
the
average
woman
lives
a
few
years
longer
than
the
average
man.
and
therefore,
more
monthly
payments
must
be
made
to
the
average
woman.
the
department
required
female
employees
to
make
higher
contributions
to
the
fund
than
comparable
male
employees.
because
contributions
were
withheld
from
paychecks,
a
female
employee
took
home
less
pay
than
a
male
employee
earning
the
same
salary.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
held
that
the
contribution
differential
violated
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
ordered
a
refund
of
excess
contributions.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
this
practice
discriminated
against
individual
female
employees
because
of
their
sex
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act.
it
is
now
well
recognized
that
employment
decisions
cannot
be
predicated
on
mere
stereotype
impressions
about
the
characteristics
of
males
or
females.
this
case
doesn't,
however,
involved
a
fictional
difference
between
men
and
women.
the
department
treated
women
differently
from
men
because
the
two
classes
are
in
fact
different.
it
is
equally
true,
however,
that
all
individuals
in
the
respect
of
classes,
do
not
share
the
characteristic
which
differentiates
the
average
class
representatives.
many
women
do
not
live
as
long
as
the
average
man,
and
many
men
outlive
the
average
woman.
the
question,
therefore,
is
whether
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
discrimination
is
to
be
determined
by
comparison
of
class
characteristics
or
individual
characteristics.
as
we
read
the
statue,
it
unambiguously
focuses
on
the
individual.
the
statute
makes
it
unlawful,
â€œ
to
discriminate
against
any
individual
with
respect
to
his
compensation,
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment,
because
of
such
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin."
the
statute
prohibits
treatment
of
an
individual,
as
simply
a
component
of
a
racial,
religious,
sexual,
or
national
class.
if
height
is
required
for
a
job,
a
tall
woman
may
not
be
refused
employment,
merely
because
the
average
woman
is
too
short.
even
a
true
generalization
about
a
class
is
an
insufficient
reason
for
disqualifying
an
individual
to
whom
the
generalization
does
not
apply.
that
proposition
is
of
critical
importance
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
assurance
that
any
individual
woman
working
for
the
department
will
actually
fit
the
generalization
on
which
the
department's
policy
is
based.
many
of
those
individuals
will
not
live
as
long
as
the
average
man.
nothing
in
the
statute
suggests
that
congress
intended
a
special
definition
of
discrimination
in
the
context
of
employee
group
insurance
coverage.
when
insurance
risks
are
grouped,
the
better
risks
always
subsidize
the
poorer
risks.
the
fact
that
many
women
will
outlive
many
men
is
no
more
significant
than
the
fact
that
many
non-smokers
will
outlive,
many
persons
who
smoked
to
excess.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
contribution
differential,
based
on
sex,
is
prohibited
by
the
act.
the
department
has
also
challenged
the
district
court's
award
of
retroactive
relief
to
the
entire
class
of
employee,
of
female
employees
and
retirees.
for
reasons
stated
in
detail,
in
the
opinion
file
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
there
is
merit
to
this
challenge.
accordingly,
although
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
statute
was
violated,
we
vacate
its
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
filed
an
opinion,
concurring
in
part,
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
also
concurring
in
part,
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
