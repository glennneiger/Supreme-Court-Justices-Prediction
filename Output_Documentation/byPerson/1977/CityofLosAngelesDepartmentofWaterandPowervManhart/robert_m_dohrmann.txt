mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
brought
by
women
employees
of
the
los
angeles
department
of
water
and
power
and
by
union
that
represents
many
of
them,
international
brotherhood
of
electric
coworkers
local
18.
we
are
challenging
an
explicit
sex
classification,
which
violates
703
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
it
is
an
explicit
violation
of
that
act.
it
is
expressed
discrimination
in
every
case,
money
is
taken
from
a
women’s
paycheck
and
not
from
the
man’s
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
alone.
that
woman
has
become
an
imperfect
and
an
imprecise
surrogate
for
the
term
long
life
or
longevity
and
that
is
it.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
mr.
chief
justice,
as
the
united
auto
workers
and
as
the
(inaudible)
cio
point
out
and
indeed
as
the
societies
of
actuaries
point
out
in
the
briefs
that
they
have
filed
with
this
court,
most
plans
in
america
are
sex
neutral,
this
is
a
rare
plan
that
requires
a
mandatory
contribution
from
the
employee
and
discriminates
between
the
employees
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
is
a
very
rare
event
and
i
know
of
no
such
litigation
in
which
men
in
the
united
auto
worker
plans
and
any
other
collectively
bargained
plan
or
in
any
other
unilateral
plan
in
which
men
have
contended,
wait
a
minute
if
the
contribution
is
the
same
for
women
as
for
men,
the
women
are
living
longer
than
we
are
and
that
is
unfair.
there
is
no
such
litigation
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
very
good
reason
why.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
but
mr.
chief
justice,
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion,
one
must
conclude
that
it
is
lawful
under
title
vii
to
treat
workers,
individual
workers
that
this
petitioner
or
any
employer
subject
to
the
act
as
men
and
as
women
as
statistics,
rather
than
as
individual
workers.
and
that
practice
is
impermissible
under
title
vii
and
this
court
has
said
so
and
all
courts
beneath
it
have
also
said
so.
it
is
improper
and
it
is
unlawful
to
treat
women
as
women.
let
me
give
an
example.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
in
the
insurance
context,
not
at
all,
because
the
insurance
industry
is
not
regulated
by
congress
to
require
that,
let
me
give
an
example
of
that
if
i
may.
if
this
employer
instead
of
operating
a
pension
fund
had
a
severance
pay
trust
in
which
several
cents
per
hour
put
into
a
severance
pay
fund
and
at
the
end
of
the
employment,
whatever
it
is
that
money
lump
sum
is
given
to
the
employee.
that
employee
may
go
to
an
insurer
whether
he
would
be
a
male
or
female
and
purchase
an
annuity
and
at
that
point
in
time,
having
left
the
employment
context
maybe
the
women
would
pay
more
for
the
annuity
than
the
man,
maybe
not.
but,
in
any
event
there
is
no
longer
the
employment
context
and
the
practice
cannot
be
judged
under
title
vii.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
the
accuracy
of
it?
no,
once
you
divide
men
and
women
as
the
insurance
industry
has
commonly
done,
you
will
find
that
a
women
on
the
average
lives
longer
than
male.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
as
an
insurer?
that
is
possible
yes.
however,
there
is
one
point
that
can
be
made
if
an
individual
buys
an
annuity
policy
or
buys
a
policy
of
life
insurance,
that
individual
can
have
specifics
concerning
his
age,
weight,
use
of
steps
such
a
the
counsel
mention
alcohol
and
tobacco
and
the
individual
profile
can
be
drawn.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
correct.
in
any
group,
in
any
group
pension
plan,
given
for
example,
there
are
12,000
employees,
there
is
no
way
to
tell
whether
men
or
lives
what.
what
particular
employee
is
going
to
live
long?
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
you
have
to
make
a
judgment,
title
vii
commands
that
that
judgment
be
made
without
respect
to
the
individual
sex,
race,
national
origin
or
religion.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
we
did
not.
we,
at
that
time,
the
union
were
not
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees,
it
had
not
won
bargaining
rights
and
did
not
negotiate
it.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
this
is
unilaterally
adapted
by
the
department
of
water
and
power.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes
they
can.
they
can
make
a
complete
medical
profile
of
an
individual.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
i
cannot
speak
for
the
industry.
although
the
industry
suggests
in
the
american
council
life
insurance
amicus
curiae
briefed
that
that
is
a
--.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
once
you
can
get
into
the
individual
posture,
where
there
is
a
retail
sale
if
you
will
of
an
insurance
contract
yes,
at
that
point
the
individual
can
be
judged.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
the
point
in
this
case
is
that
when
you
are
administering
a
group
plan,
you
cannot
individually
analyze
each
employee.
it
is
possible
if
you
wish
to,
to
make
an
individual
analysis
is
not
commonly
done.
in
most
plans.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
correct
mr.
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
this
is
an
uninsured
plan,
which
is
not
even
regulated
by
the
state
of
california.
this
employer
manages
its
own
uninsured
pension
plan.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
well,
nonetheless.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
not
exactly
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
policy
is
being
issued
to
an
employer.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
to
an
employer
who
he
has
a
pension
plan
which
it
does
not
self
insure,
then
in
that
instance
the
insurer
provides
the
mechanism
for
the
employer
to
provide
the
benefit
in
turn
and
that
must
be
on
a
neutral
basis
and
it
is
commonly
done
on
a
neutral
basis.
here,
the
department
contends
that
it
must
measure
longevity.
assuming
it
must
conceding
that
longevity
is
necessary
as
a
measuring
right
of
physical
soundness,
why
does
it
select
sex?
why
is
that
single
immutable
characteristic
chosen
rather
than
the
others
that
we
have
discussed?
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
16
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
government
in
this
case,
you
will
find
that
as
recently
as
1974,
it
has
been
identified
that
black
persons
in
america
have
greater
mortality
or
earlier
mortality
than
do
caucasians.
what
i
am
saying
mr.
chief
justice
--.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
our
case
is
sex
and
if
the
suggestion
is
because
for
100
years
it
has
been
noticed
that
women
live
longer
than
man,
my
response
is
that
since
1964
or
since
1972
when
the
act
was
amended
to
apply
to
this
public
employer,
it
is
no
longer
lawful
to
look
to
that
common
experience
that
statistic
and
apply
it
in
such
manner
as
in
this
case
so
that
women
are
given
15%
less
pay
than
man
because
it
is
assumed
that
each
women
because
she
is
a
woman,
is
going
to
live
to
some
statistical
average
which
is
longer
than
each
man.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
may
i
say
that
the
department
of
water
and
power
the
city
of
los
angeles,
is
becoming
increasingly
less,
easy
to
tell
if
that
was
between
a
man
and
woman
because
woman
who
formally
worked
as
clerks
and
stenographers
are
now
employed
pursuant
to
a
preneurship
programs
as
cables
splicers,
as
a
lineman,
as
tower
line
mechanics,
they
are
entering
professions
they
never
before
were
in.
women,
consistent
with
title
vii
and
with
the
affirmative
action
plan
of
this
department
say
its
pension
plan
are
doing
the
work
that
men
did
solely
as
men
before
but
now
it
is
common.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
sex
is
immutable
as
you
say,
it
cannot
be
changed.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
it
is
readily
identifiable
but
why
is
it
identified
and
then
used
to
penalize
the
person
solely
because
she
is
a
woman.
she
receives
15%
less
than
a
man
in
her
paycheck
and
yet
her
a
rent
that
is
the
same,
her
medical
bills
are
the
same,
her
bills
at
the
supermarket
are
the
same.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
why
not
pull
all
risk
then
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
even
as
now,
every
other
single
risk
is
being
pulled
by
this
plan
and
a
vast
majority
of
plans
in
america.
why
cannot
we
pull
all
risks?
why
use
sex?
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
it
is
and
we
present,
contend
that
that
choice
is
unlawful.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
but
who
is
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
each
man
is
going
to
live
to
his
statistical
abstract
age?
men
die
young,
men
lived
longer
than
the
statistics
say
they
are
going
to
live.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
will
open
the
brief
for
the
government
using
the
same
mortality
tables
that
the
department
of
water
and
power
uses,
the
1951
group
immunity
tables,
men
and
women
share
common
death
age,
death
ages
in
86%
of
the
age
groups.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
well,
the
accuracy
of
the
tables
is
not
in
this
in
dispute
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
only
mentioned
it
or
pointed
out
to
show
that
if
there
is
any
difference
in
longevity,
it
occurs
at
the
extremes
of
retirement
age
rather
than
being
a
persistent
distinction
among
the
age
groups
as
they
progressed
through
retirement.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
i
mean,
early
deaths
of
people
who
die
early
after
let
us
say,
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
sixty-five,
say
between
65
and
70.
more
men
will
die
in
the
early
retirement
ages
at
age
65
to
70
unmatched
by
a
women’s
deaths
then
in
the
area
in
which
most
people's
longevity
falls,
the
middle
to
late
70s,
that
86%
congruity
that
are
mentioned
occurs
and
women
and
men
die
matched
each
of
the
other
the
same
or
common
death
age.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
the
figures
that
are
used
that
were
once
prepared
by
tiaa
and
they
are
prepared
in
5
year
increments.
they
could
be
done
in
single
year
increments
and
the
same
result
would
apply.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
mr.
justice
stewart,
section
703(a)(1)
on
its
face,
says
it
discriminates
against
a
person
by
a
reason
of
sex
if
her
compensation
is
less
than
that
of
a
man.
in
this
case
as
counsel
admits,
the
woman
takes
home
15%
less
than
does
a
man.
it
is
deducted
from
her
paycheck,
she
has
no
choice
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
this
practice
could
only
be
safe
if
the
factor
used
to
conduct
the
15%
from
the
paycheck
is
“any
other
factor
other
than
sex”.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
because
i
think
the
congress
wanted
to
make
it
clear
and
i
think
the
committee
reports
underscore
this
is
that
other
factors
such
as
merits
systems,
seniority
systems,
lifting
weight
requirement,
those
other
factors
neutral
as
far
as
sex
is
concerned
would
be
employable
by
an
employer
in
setting
a
wage
rate
and
other
factor
other
than
sex.
i
adopt
what
the
court
below
said
in
this
case,
it
is
playing
with
words
to
say
that
this
practice
is
based
on
any
factor
other
than
sex.so
the
bennett
amendment
703(h)
is
simply
not
available
as
a
defense
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
not
the
burden
of
plaintiff
to
show
that
bennett
amendment
is
not
a
defense.
i
think
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
employer
and
the
employer
has
failed
to
meet
it.
the
employer
here
has
said
that
it
is
seeking
to
determine
longevity
and
it
is
has
decided
the
sole
measure
of
longevity
will
be
sex.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
if
longevity
changes
maybe
the
tables
would
change.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
you
correctly
stated
earlier
mr.
justice
white,
the
problem
is
not
in
the
maintenance
of
such
tables.
it
is
when
they
are
used
to
apply
the
sole
and
only
cost
of
longevity
to
one
sex
even
though
it
bears
only
some
co-relation
to
longevity
and
not
a
complete
one.
this
is
not
as
counsel
would
suggest,
a
situation
in
which
all
men
cannot
have
the
particular
or
do
not
undergo
the
same
particular
condition
that
all
women
do
or
all
women
who
are
capable
of.
in
this
case
we
have
two
groups,
we
have
men
and
we
have
women.
they
die
at
different
times
but
they
are
charged
differently
for
the
privilege
of
having
a
retirement
income
that
is
the
same
and
the
women
are
the
ones
that
have
to
pay
more
for
it.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
statistical
individual,
that
is
statistical
individual
will
get
more
but
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
mr.
chief
justice
in
my
humble
opinion,
the
law
in
my
opinion
requires
that
they
be
treated
as
individuals
that
these
women
at
water
and
power
be
treated
as
individuals
and
that
they
receive
the
same
treatment
as
men,
that
they
not
be
treated
as
women
and
charged
something
more
for
the
disputable
benefit
or
privilege
of
being
a
woman.
it
just
does
not
follow.
in
griggs
against
duke
power
this
court
said,
“individuals
are
to
be
tested
so
that
the
individual’s
capability
to
do
the
work
assigned
is
the
key
that
will
be
in
the
decisional
process
of
the
employer”.
not
some
statistic,
not
something
outside
of
your
employment
relationship,
not
some
casual
acquaintanceship
with
a
particular
race
or
sex
group
and
may
i
underscore,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
affirmed
in
this
case,
that
that
will
leave
the
door
open
to
the
utilization
of
any
other
analysis,
which
goes
off
on
the
basis
race,
national
origin
or
religion.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
the
equal
pay
act
would
not
give
them
the
defense.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
that
only
deals
with
sex.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
well,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
race.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
if
they
have
for
example
a
group
insurance.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
this
situation,
if
sex
is
permissible
under
703(a)(1)
as
an
indicator
of
longevity.
and
so
also,
as
any
other
class
which
is
otherwise
protected
by
703(a)(1)
then,
statistics
could
be
used
to
as
we
talked
earlier,
to
show
that
black
persons
living
shorter
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
alright,
excuse
me.
if
you
found
that
this
is
based
upon
a
factor
other
than
sex,
you
are
correct,
that
would
be
unlimited
holding
that
somehow
or
rather
this
is
a
factor
other
than
sex.
and
then
it
would
not
follow
that
the
other
classifications
would
be
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
now,
the
further
impact
of
course
is
that
other
cases,
there
is
another
practice
in
which
unlike
this
one
the
contribution
levels
are
the
same
but
benefits
paid
out
at
the
end
are
lower,
that
is
also
in
our
opinion
a
pernicious
practice.
it
is
not
our
case,
we
are
not
here
to
argue
about
that
practice
but
we
point
out
that
it
also
would
be
in
severe
jeopardy
with
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
appeals
in
this
case.
we
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
the
administrative
agencies
that
have
considered
this
question,
that
is
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
and
the
wage
and
hour
administrator
of
the
department
of
labor
had
both
concluded
affirmatively
and
very
strongly
that
this
practice,
this
specific
practice
of
charging
women
more
to
get
the
same
benefit
as
men,
violates
not
only
703(a)
of
the
title
vii
but
also,
also
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
i
did
not
concede
that
sir
and
mr.
chief
justice;
i
cannot
concede
that
in
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
but
for
women,
women
cannot
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
but
we
cannot
consider
woman
as
a
class.
this
court
has
said
it
many
times.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
my
clients
are
individual
employees
of
the
department
of
water
and
power.
they,
each
of
them
assert
their
right
to
be
treated
as
an
individual
member
and
an
employee
to
the
department
of
water
and
power
and
not
as
a
woman
who
therefore
is
a
member
of
a
class
that
has
a
statistical
capacity
to
live
longer
than
man.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
gamble
then
and
of
course
is
very
precisely
or
more
precisely
capable
of
measurement
is
how
long
is
that
person
going
to
live.
if
you
take
your
context
here,
of
course
they
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
labor
department
regulation,
mr.
justice
stewart
reported
that
the
29cfr
part
800
and
i
would
specifically
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
section
800.151,
which
thoroughly
and
very
expressly
condemns
this
practice.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
under
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
not
directly
with
title
vii.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct
but
the
equal
pay
act
can
be,
the
exceptions
the
equal
pay
act
can
be
a
defense,
i
point
out
not
only
--.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes
it
has.
there
has
never
been
a
ruling
of
the
labor
department
on
this
matter
that
is
inconsistent
with
them,
there
is
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
eeoc,
i
was
just
going
to
point
out.
there
is
another
regulation,
800.116(d),
it
deals
with
the
employer
contributions
which
could
be
read
as
inconsistent
with
151.
however,
the
government
has
pointed
out
to
the
court
in
this
case
that
800.116(d)
is
under
reconsideration
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
to
the
extent
it
had
any
applicability
and
it
does
not
to
this
case
because
this
case
deals
with
employee
contributions,
if
it
had
any
applicability
because,
it
is
under
reconsideration
and
151
is
not,
it
has
lost
its
power
to
persuade.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
the
first
regulation
issued
by
the
labor
department
was
116(d)
in
1965
and
151
was
issued
either
in
65
or
66
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
equal
pay
act
was
enacted
1963,
effective
in
1964.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
i
a
beg
your
pardon
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
their
regulations
are
reported
at
title
29
cfr
1604,
are
also
completely
consistent
with
the
position
that
i
have
given
you
today
and
have
never
been
inconsistent.
they
have
always
been
a
flat
prohibition
against
this
kind
of
practice.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
they
appear
in
our
brief
at
page
36.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
thirty-six
and
the
following
there
is
the
discussion
of
the
eeoc.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
the
regulations
have
always
been
consistent
with
the
position
that
i
have
enunciated
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission?
yes
they
have.
mr.
justice
white
they
have,
ever
since
they
first
took
a
position
on
this
kind
of
fringe
benefit,
they
have
taken
the
position
that
this
practice
is
not
allowable.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
there
is
an
opinion
letter
of
the
general
counsel
apparently
addressed
to
a
private
employer.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
he
was
the
general
counsel,
he
was
not
the
commission
itself,
he
was
the
general
counsel.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
expression
in
that
letter
is
indeed
in
conflict
with
the
eeoc’s
own
guidelines.
however,
the
government
he
has
pointed
out
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
the
guidelines
that
i
am
now
speaking
of
did
not
evolve
until
1973.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct.
and
may
i
point
out
that
however.
mr.
justice
white
may
i
point
out
two
quick
things.
one
is,
that
that
letter
of
the
eeoc
general
counsel
came
after
the
eeoc
itself
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
of
rosen
against
public
service
corporation,
the
eeoc
itself
issued
a
letter
determining
that
the
practice
in
rosen
which
involved
similar
practices
here
as
well
as
mandatory
retirement
age
is
based
on
sex
but,
financial
differences
is
as
well.
the
eeoc
determined
in
rosen
that
that
practice
violated
the
act
and
that
determination,
upon
which
the
lawsuit
then
commenced
in
rosen
was
prior
to
this
one
isolated
letter
written
by
the
general
counsel
to
a
private
company
which
was
published
by
a
service
and
if
you
look
at
the
provision
of
the
federal
register
that
is
cited
in
the
government’s
brief,
you
will
find
that
there
is
an
eeoc
statement.
that
letters
issued
by
the
general
counsel
are
for
the
purpose
of
private
advice
to
particular
inquirers
and
that
they
do
not
have
the
force
of
president
and
they
are
only
to
gave
for
the
personal
use
of
the
individual
or
company
to
whom
the
letter
is
written.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
it
is
a
private
reply
of
the
general
counsel
to
a
letter
or
it
is
a
request
for
a
private
ruling.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
most
definitely,
i
challenge
it
mr.
justice
white.
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
commission
itself
had
issued
cost
determinations
in
cases
as
early
as
rosen,
and
the
determination
in
the
rosen
case
was
issued
very
early
in
1965,
as
you
will
note
from
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
opinions
discussed
in
the
background
of
the
cases.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
time
that
remains,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
1972,
when
this
act
was
amended,
the
congress
noted
that
to
its
dismay,
in
the
years
since
1964
when
title
vii
was
enacted,
women’s
position
in
employment
had
not
only,
not
improved,
it
seemed
to
have
slightly
deteriorated.
and
congress
very
clearly
enunciated
when
it
made
this
act
applicable
to
this
employer
the
discrimination
against
women
is
no
less
serious
than
any
other
form
of
prohibited
discrimination
and
the
same
degree
of
social
concern
applies
to
it.
we
presented
to
you
a
very
clear
case
in
which
this
employer
has
taken
sex
and
sex
alone,
and
on
the
basis
of
the
act
made
a
very
suspect
determination
that
all
women
are
going
to
live
longer
than
all
men.
a
conclusive
presumption
that
whether
my
clients,
the
tower
line
mechanics
or
secretaries,
they
are
going
to
live
longer
than
the
males
beside
whom
they
perform
work
for
the
same
price
and
that
is
not
fair
and
we
ask
for
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
is
going
to
live
longer.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
there
is
the
percentage
of
the
pay
of
the
employee.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
it
depends
also
upon
the
age
of
the
employee.
in
other
words
is
if
an
employee
who
enters
the
employment
of
age
40
then
that
employee’s
contribution
level
will
be
a
little
higher
amount
out
of
his
pay
than
it
would
be
had
he
joined
the
employment
of
the
department
at
age
30.
the
obvious
reason
is
--
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
yes,
that
the
formula
then
is
set,
it
remains
the
same
through
the
employment
years.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
there
has
not
mr.
justice
stewart
for
the
reason
that
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
mcmann
against
the
united
airlines
there
is
an
exemption
in
that
act.
not
applicable
in
title
vii
that
age
or
that
bona
fide
pension
plans
which
consider
age
are
lawful
and
are
exempted
from
the
age
discrimination.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
maybe,
but
it
is
not
my
case.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no
i
would
not,
because
that
is
the
kind
of
severance
pay
plan
i
referred
to
earlier.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
that
may
be
mr.
chief
justice,
it
also
may
not
be.
each
individual
will
go
out
into
the
insurance
market
and
maybe
able
to
purchase
from
competitive
insurers
based
on
their
own
profile,
a
better
price
or
a
different
price
than
each
other.
mr.
robert
m.
dohrmann
no,
but
all
i
know
is
that
once
this
severance
pay
has
been
made
then
the
employee
then
leaves
the
employment
relationship.
and
what
she
does
with
the
money
is
no
longer
subject
to
the
provisions
of
titles
vii
and
the
civil
rights
act.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
