unknown
speaker
mr.
oliphant,
is
it
true
that
members
of
one
race
or
actuarial
principle
might
have
a
longer
expectancy
than
members
of
another
race?
unknown
speaker
have
insurance
rates
in
fact
been
different
for
let
us
say
for
blacks
than
for
whites?
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
today
would
this
case
be
here
on
that
possible
basis?
unknown
speaker
you
just
stated
that
race
is
no
longer
a
factor
then
in
setting
of
insurance
rates,
how
did
that
come
about,
by
voluntary
actions
on
the
part
of
insurance
companies?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
quite
understand.did
you
say
that
in
title
vii
congress
treats
sex
discrimination
entirely
differently
from
the
way
the
statute
treats
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
as
the
bfoq
of
course
for
discriminating
as
between
men
and
women,
males
and
females
and
that
does
not
exist,
it
is
a
justification
for
discriminating
among
races
but
except
for
that,
is
there
any
difference
in
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
surely,
there
are
actuarial
tables
available
for
just
people
are
there
not?
life
expectancy
of
people
in
the
united
states
of
america
of
both
sexes
and
to
every
ethnic
background.
unknown
speaker
but
now
they
are
not?
unknown
speaker
how
you
can
say
that
you
make
the
people
who
do
not
live
so
long
subsidize
the
people
who
leave
longer?
unknown
speaker
like
i
suppose
the
males
who
do
not
live
so
and
then
the
people
who
die
younger
subsidize
the
males
who
live
longer.
unknown
speaker
of
course
that
is
what
the
plaintiffs
not
on
sought
but
in
a
way;
were
accorded
in
the
recent
nashville
case
against
satty.
men
just
do
not
just
get
pregnant,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
and
so
women
asking
for
treatment
by
an
employer
for
a
condition
that
men
just
do
not
have
and
that
is
sort
of
a
(voice
overlap).
so
that
was
in
a
way
preferential
treatment,
they
are
asking
for
and
were
accorded.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right
but
--.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
facially
neutral
would
you
say
it
is
facially
discriminatory?
unknown
speaker
but
they
receive
different
compensation
on
the
face
of
it,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
only
available
if
they
retire,
if
they
quit,
they
do
not
get
any
of
that.
unknown
speaker
but
only
the
part
they
put
in,
do
they
get
the
employer's
contribution
too?
unknown
speaker
if
they
quit
before
retirement
age
they
only
get
their
own
contribution
back.
unknown
speaker
if
you
say
this
is
facially
neutral
as
well
as
factually
neutral.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
not
facially
neutral
and
you
would
say
it
is
not
facially
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
are
you
defining
the
term
discriminate
to
mean
something
that
is
cost
justified
is
not
discriminatory?
and
that
is
all
as
you
can
explain
there
is
a
difference
in
cost
to
justify
the
difference
in
original
payment,
it
is
not
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
really
asking
i
suppose
in
general
electric
as
i
understand
the
case,
they
held
there
was
no
prima
facie
case.
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
arguing
there
is
no
prime
facie
case
or
that
if
there
is
a
prima
facie
case,
we
have
an
affirmative
defense
that
overcomes
it.
unknown
speaker
because
i
thought
the
bennett
amendment
was
provided
an
affirmative
defense
that
is
why
i
really
want
to
ask
you
the
question.
you
say
they
qualify
the
prima
facie
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
oliphant,
under
your
new
state
law,
you
are
now
making
equal
payments
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
have
you
had
any
treats
or
suits
by
males?
unknown
speaker
well
i
take
it
you
feel
that
the
new
state
law
is
completely
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
why
does
he
not
violate
title
vii?
why
could
not
a
man
suing
for
violating
title
vii
if
he
does
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
federal
law
supersedes
the
state
law
on
this
subject
unless
if
it
is
addressed
to
the
same
subject,
unless
there
is
an
expressed
or
implied
exception
to
allow
the
state
to
legislate
it.
when
your
legislating
equality,
it
is
hard
to
say
that
the
federal
statute
requires
equality
but
permits
a
state
to
require
even
more
equality.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
of
your
position
as
justice
rehnquist
obviously
is.
i
take
it
that
your
position
is
this
--
that
it
is
alright
to
use
objectively
verifiable
differentiating
factors
between
the
sexes
and
the
determination
of
these
rates
but
that
you
are
not
required
to
and
since
the
change
in
your
law
--
you
have
gone
along
with
and
i
take
it
that
what
you
just
said
you
think
this
is
alright.
unknown
speaker
could
be
the
same
argument
be
made
about
smokers
and
non-smokers
and
one
subsidizes
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
there
studies
that
show
that
the
longevity
of
a
non-smoker
is
greater
than
the
longevity
of
the
smoker.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
are
not
identifiable
differences,
though
as
so
far
as
the
actuaries
are
concerned.
is
there
any
way
that
you
can
measure
how
long
a
person
has
smoked
and
how
many
packages
does
he
smokes
a
day?
the
way
you
can
measure
the
longevity
of
a
man
against
a
women?
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
it
then
insurance
companies
spend
millions
of
dollars
to
stop
their
policy
holders
from
smoking?
unknown
speaker
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
this
change
them
to
sell
annuity
than
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
they
advertise
and
spend
all
kind
of
money
to
stop
people
from
smoking.
unknown
speaker
but
what
other
public
service
do
they
pay
for?
unknown
speaker
anybody
who
is
only
in
the
annuity
business
wants
his
customer
and
he
would
want
him
to
die
as
promptly
as
possible.
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
so.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
women
can
argue
that
the
reason
their
longevity
is
greater
is
because
they
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
past
and
as
if,
if
as
many
women
had
become
company
presidents
as
men
had,
they
too
would
have
died
in
an
earlier
age
from
stress.
unknown
speaker
you
said
in
the
contrary
in
a
moment
ago
that
the
more
the
women
come
in
to
the
labor
market,
the
longer
they
live.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say
this
is
your
experience
you
are
not
suggesting
that
this
is
the
experience
that
has
yet
been
reflected
by
the
pervasive
actuarial
studies
of
the
american
experience
in
mortality.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
challenge
the
accuracy
and
separate
mortality
tables
at
all
namely
that
if
'x'
and
'y'
go
to
buy
an
annuity,
once
a
man
and
once
a
woman,
you
accept
the
fact
that
the
insurance
company
or
whoever
selling
the
annuity
would
say,
“well,
you
as
a
women
have
a
life
expectancy
of
certain
amount
and
the
man
has
a
certain
lesser
life
expectancy
and
therefore
we
have
to
charge
you
more”,
the
women.
you
do
not
challenge
the
accuracy
of
those.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
were
selling
an
annuity
to
a
woman
as
to
distinguish
from
a
man
and
you
could,
and
you
thought
that
it
might
cost
you
more
to
provide
the
annuity
because
the
woman
has
a
greater
life
expectancy,
it
would
probably
charge
more
i
suppose
or
you
would
go
broke.
unknown
speaker
but
you
cannot,
it
is
if
you
do
not
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
life
expectancy
prediction
for
women,
i
take
it
you
most
agree
than
you
cannot
individualize
among
the
women
which
ones
are
going
to
live
long
and
which
are
going
to
die
sooner
or
just
like
with
the
men.
unknown
speaker
then
it
has
to
start
collecting
now
to
provide
the
annuity
later,
you
got
to
make
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
do
the
ibew
negotiate
this
contract
for
the
employees?
unknown
speaker
was
this,
did
any
other
union
or
was
this
just
unilaterally.
unknown
speaker
no,
that
was
not
a
product
at
all
of
collective
bargain.
unknown
speaker
do
insurance
company
in
selling
individual
annuities
consider
smoking
habit
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
the
rates
there
are
in
accordance
with
--
unknown
speaker
in
other
way,
it
cannot
be
changed
but
if
it
is
readily
identifiable.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
extremes
or
retirement
age?
unknown
speaker
i
would
request
you
to
say
what
is
early?
unknown
speaker
but
the
unmatched
women
average
death
is
about
88
and
unmatched
men
about
70.0.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dohrmann.
unknown
speaker
but
still
the
claim
is
anyway
that
it
is
still
longevity
that
distinguishes
that
--
i
suppose
if
the
longevity
tables
changed,
there
are
let
us
say,
if
there
were
some
changes
in
it,
there
rates
would
change?
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
be
true
of
the
equal
pay
if
it
were
reversed
on
the
equal
pay
act.
unknown
speaker
the
race
is
not
covered
by
the
bennett
amendment
at
all.
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
first
regulation
that
you
mentioned
issued
by
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
the
regulations
have
always
been.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
an
opinion
letter
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
from
mr.
duncan.
unknown
speaker
well
this
is
a
general
counsel
of
eeoc.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
he
is
speaking
on
behalf
of
--
purporting
to
speak
and
have
to
have
the
commission
and
the
opinion
is
in
conflict
with.
unknown
speaker
but
the
guidelines
were
in
existence
at
that
time,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
they
came
out
eight
years
after
the
enactment
of
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
amicus’s
brief
says
this
interpretation
remained
in
effect
until
april
of
72,
do
you
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
the
amicus’s
brief
says
that
this
interpretation
made
by
the
general
counsel’s
interpretation
remained
in
effect
until
april
of
72.
unknown
speaker
that
each
of
them
is
going
to
live
long.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dohrmann,
before
you
sit
down,
help
me
in
one
factual
the
deduction
from
the
paycheck,
how
is
it?
is
it
percentage
of
the
paycheck?
unknown
speaker
one
percentage
for
men
and
another
percentage
for
women?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it,
for
all
men,
is
it
the
same
percentage?
unknown
speaker
is
the
calculation
is
the
same
from
then
on?
unknown
speaker
if
they
predated
the
enactment
of
the
statute
as
well,
and
that
may
not
be
true
anymore
under
amendment.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
annual
reports
of
the
eeoc,
did
they
reflect
a
change
in
view
earlier
than
that
or
later
than
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
general
counsel.
unknown
speaker
if
that
has
what
effect
would
then
be?
unknown
speaker
a
number
of
the
staff
that
has
taken
the
different
position
that
is
all.
unknown
speaker
well
who
is
the
other
one?
unknown
speaker
i
should
not
have
asked
the
question.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
oliphant,
could
you
help
me
a
little
more
on
the
perhaps
it
is
in
the
papers
and
i
missed
it,
but
on
the
way
in
which
the
contribution
is
made,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
larger
contribution
by
the
female
than
by
the
male.
is
there
difference,
depending
on
the
age
of
which
the
employee
entered
the
work
under
the
employment.
unknown
speaker
now
what,
which
is
higher,
would
you
say
i
came
in
the
30
and
someone
else
came
in
the
35,
which
would
make
the
higher
contribution?
unknown
speaker
but
also,
there
is
a
less
longevity.
unknown
speaker
some
35
years
old
has
a
less
or
a
greater
longevity
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
longevity
talks
about
when
they
have
to
die?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
one
who
comes
into
the
workforce
as
an
older
person
pays
a
higher.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
going
to
pay
for
fewer
years.
unknown
speaker
he
is
going
to
make
payments
for
fewer
years.
unknown
speaker
you
take
into
account
a
whole
lot
of
things.
unknown
speaker
mr.
oliphant,
does
the
record
explain
how
the
differing
contributions
for
each
year
were
calculated?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
cannot
tell
the
extent
to
which
the
longevity
figured
as
of
the
age
of
entering
the
employment
of
the
company.
to
what
extent
age
affected
the
contribution
rate?
unknown
speaker
and
the
record
does
not
tell
us.
unknown
speaker
who
made
them?
oh,
they
made
motion?
unknown
speaker
the
benefits
that
are
calculated
are
a
function
of
what?
is
it
at
the
number
of
--
tell
me
how
again.
how
is
the
benefit
calculated?
unknown
speaker
not
--
your
salary
level,
makes
no
difference.
unknown
speaker
is
salary
average
over
the
period
or
at
retirement
age?
unknown
speaker
and
the
contributions
are
a
percentage
of
salary
always?
unknown
speaker
and
the
percentage
depends
on
a,
your
sex
and
b,
the
age
in
which
you
have
joined
the
company.
