chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
city
of
los
angeles
against
manhart
and
others.
mr.
oliphant
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
it
have
any
effect
on
the
insurance
companies
charging
more
for
annuities
for
women
and
for
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
higher
rates
correspondingly
for
joint
and
survivorship
annuities
for
a
husband
and
wife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
a
time
along
at
least
through
within
our
lifetimes
when
some
insurance
companies
would
not
insure
either
american-indians
or
negroes,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
no
longer
so.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
american
experience
table
of
mortality
used
by
the
insurance
companies
distinguish
between
men
and
women?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
surely
does
and
has
for
more
than
50
years
on
the
rates
of
annuities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
if
they
did
not
distinguish,
how
would
they
have
any
basis
for
a
different
rate
for
annuities
for
women
and
for
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
answer
must
be
that
the
american
experience
table
does
have
a
separate
rating.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
this
decision
would?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
the
females
are
getting
a
higher
pay
for
the
same
work,
total
pay
if
you
take
into
account
the
annuity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
complaint
about
the
ninth
circuit
is
it,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
that
it
requires
the
things,
which
are
different,
and
they
treat
it
as
though
they
were
the
same.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
advertise
about
cancer
and
a
whole
lot
of
things,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
oliphant.
mr.
dohrmann.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
about
the
lawsuit
men
might
bring
if
they
are
required
to
subsidize
the
women?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why,
when
i
put
that
question
to
you,
it
was
a
hypothetical
question.
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
litigation
or
not
but
the
suggestion
was
made,
that
if
men
must
subsidize
women
by
paying
more
then
the
women
will
pay
for
the
same
return
and
that
in
itself
is
a
discrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
unlawful
for
a
life
insurance
company
to
charge
more
for
women’s
annuities
than
for
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
could
take
a
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
overrate,
up-rate
for
a
certain
conditions,
overweight
being
one
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
they
can
refuse
if
they
want
for
the
ground
of
overweight
that
reaches
impermissible
proportions
medically.
they
refuse
to
insure
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
private
insurance
companies
do
issue
good
policies
do
they
not?
in
which
no
medical
examination
is
required
and
they
just
average
out
the
whole
risk
over
the
whole
group.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
is
because
for
more
than
a
hundred
years,
the
american
experience
table
of
mortality
and
its
successors
have
identified
statistically
the
fact
that
women
outlive
men
by
a
substantial
number
of
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
after
someday
they
may
take
that
into
account
but
that
is
not
our
case
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
matter
of
choice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
a
contention
here
of
a
violation
of
the
statute
that
perhaps
that
choice
will
be
made
sometime
by
a
society
as
a
whole
and
by
industry.
but
now
we
are
confronted
with
proposition
that
you
say,
the
woman
have
to
pay
15%
more,
the
answer
of
the
men
to
that
is,
if
they
do
not
pay
15%
more
then
men
are
required
to
pay
to
receive
less
pay
ultimately
because
they
subsidized
the
women’s
annuity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
from
your
statement,
you
concede
that
they
on
the
average
statistically,
will
receive
the
retirement
for
a
longer
period.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
said
same
benefit
that
you
have
several
times
conceded
i
that
thought
that
the
ultimate
benefit
is
not
the
same
for
women.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
if
for
a
individual
woman
it
may
not
be
but
for
a
women,
it
is
different.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
women
as
a
class.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
reference
should
have
been
to
a
woman
and
not
to
women.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
applies
only
to
that
particular
company
and
to
none
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
someone
else
put
a
question
to
you
and
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
can
clarify
that
if,
union
negotiated
with
the
employer
and
agreed
that
we
are
going
to
abolish
the
pension
plan
that
we
will
increase
the
pay
by
the
average
amount
that
the
pension
plan
would
cost
so
that
men
and
women
on
doing
the
same
work
would
get
exactly
to
the
penny
the
same
amount,
the
same
pay.
and
on
the
theory
that
then
each
was
to
buy
his
or
her
own
annuity
or
fund
it
in
any
way
they
wanted,
would
you
think
that
would
violate
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
the
women
are
going
to
have
to
pay
more,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
that
you
can
point
to
that
supports
the
idea
that
women
can
buy
annuities
cheaper
than
men
can
buy
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
