justice
potter
stewart
the
chief
justices
indicated
in
a
question
few
moments
ago,
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
or
not
the
practice
of
a
petitioner
violates
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended
in
1972.
nobody,
so
far
as
federal
law
goes
of
course,
this
would
not
been
a
violation
on
the
other
part
of
any
employer
prior
to
1964
would
not
have
been
a
violation
on
the
part
of
this
employer
prior
to
1972
for
public
governmental
employers
under
the
statute.
it
really
worked
in
with
a
statutory
question
are
we
not?
you
have
mentioned
the
equal
pay
act
and
its
incorporation
in
the
1964
statute.
i
take
it
we
all
accept
these
statistics,
these
actuarial
tables
and
i
am
interested
in
the
statutory
argument
because
that
is
our
question.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
impact
of
the
bennett
amendment
and
the
equal
pay
act?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
they
propose
to
use
the
used
the
word
others
twice
in
that
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
it
is
a
defense
or
do
you
think
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
plaintiff
needs
to
prove
the
absence
of
the
factors
of
the
bennett
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
by
dealing
with
the
sex
right.
justice
potter
stewart
bennett
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
you
suggest
hypothetically
might
be
some
these
other
studies.
what
might
its
impact
as
they
--
if
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
was
reversed.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
race
as
my
brother
rehnquist
has
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
not,
it
happens
you
just
agreed
that
that
would
not
be
true,
if
the
basis
upon
which
this
court
decided
the
case
were
703(h).
justice
potter
stewart
but
even
in
the
area
of
differentiation
between
the
males
and
females,
what
further
impact
would
the
judgment
reverse
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
in
your
submission.
i
thought
that
what
is
you
set
out
to
tell
us.
justice
potter
stewart
you
start
to
tell
us
about
the
regulations
against
first,
what
was
the
labor
department
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
equal
pay
act?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
directly
with
title
vii?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
labor
department
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
consistent
policy
from
the
beginning
in
the
labor
department
under
the
equal
pay
act?
justice
potter
stewart
eeoc
under
title
vii?
justice
potter
stewart
and
equal
pay
act
was
enacted
in
what
year?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
you
proceed,
i
am
curious
about
eeoc
regulations.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
appear
on
your
brief
on
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been
any
lawsuits
attacking
this
plan
based
upon
the
federal
law
that
prohibits
discrimination
based
on
age?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
predated
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
predated
the
enactment
of
statute.
