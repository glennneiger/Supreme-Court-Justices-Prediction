but
your
suggestion
that
other
factors
could
play
a
role
as
they
undoubtedly
can,
this
does
not
mean
that
it
is
as
simple
to
classify
on
the
basis
of
other
factors.
if
you
are
talking
about
smoking,
drinking,
obesity,
you
are
going
to
have
forms
to
fill
up,
you
are
going
to
have
to
take
the
word
or
reject
the
word
of
an
applicant.
the
one
thing
about
a
sex
classification
is
that
at
least
until
recently
it
was
quite
easy
to
tell
a
man
from
a
woman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
dispute
the
notion
that
it
has
been
really
easier
to
make
a
spot
judgment
as
to
whether
a
person
is
a
man
or
a
woman
as
opposed
the
fact
whether
they
are
a
smoker
or
non
smoker,
overweight
or
underweight
or
a
drinker
or
non
drinker.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
may
be
a
very
legitimate
argument
on
your
part.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
from
the
insurance
companyâ€™s
point
of
view,
it
maybe
a
much
easier
proposition
to
distinguish
on
the
basis
of
sex
than
it
is
on
the
basis
of
individualized
answers
which
it
is
much
more
doubtful
to
come
up
with
the
truth
about.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
this
is
often
summary
judgment
it
is
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
act
is
justice
white
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
table
that
something
should
have
been
resolved
by
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
facts.
