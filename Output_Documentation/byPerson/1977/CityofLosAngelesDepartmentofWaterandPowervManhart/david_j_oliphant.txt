mr.
david
j.
oliphant
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
because
the
court
of
appeals
refuses
to
follow
the
supreme
court
in
general
electric
versus
gilbert.
manhart
decision
was
issued
just
ten
days
before
the
gilbert
decision
came
down
and
was
directly
contrary
to
the
gilbert
decision.
nevertheless,
two
of
the
three
judges
refused
to
change
their
opinion.
we
are
also
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
follow
the
plain
language
of
the
statutes
and
the
will
of
congress.
this
is
just
a
question
of
statutory
construction
but
what
the
respondents
seek
is
a
policy
statement
from
the
court
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
contrary
to
the
will
of
congress
and
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
gilbert
and
in
nashville,
nashville
gas
versus
satty.
in
september,
a
case
was
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
california
are
entitled
retired
public
employees
association
versus
the
state
of
california.
the
case
is
a
suit
under
title
vii
by
females
to
recover
back
retirement
contributions
and
by
males
to
increase
retirement
benefits.
the
california
public
employee
retirement
system
had
both
unequal
contributions
and
unequal
benefits
based
on
sex
differentiated
actuarial
tables.
we
cite
this
case
simply
to
emphasize
to
the
court
today
that
in
this
particular
case,
only
the
female
employees
are
before
the
court
but
the
impact
of
this
decision
will
affect
male
employees,
their
spouses
and
a
multitude
of
retirements
systems
across
the
country
has
witnessed
the
many
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
ultimately,
it
may
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor.
we
would
like
to
point
out
first
four
points
that
we
would
like
to
make
in
argument
and
then
commence
the
arguments
if
we
may.
first,
this
case
is
just
an
application
of
the
principles
in
general
electric
versus
gilbert.
second,
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act
do
not
prohibit
the
practice
challenge
that
is
to
measure
contributions
and
benefits
in
retirement
plans
using
sex
differentiated
mortality
tables.
third,
the
lower
courts
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
contrary
decision,
as
they
did
had
to
abdicate
their
responsibility
and
differ
totally
to
decisions
of
administrative
agencies
that
were
contrary
to
the
statutes
and
contrary
to
their
own
authority
to
issue
such
bulletins.
and
finally,
congress
did
not
intend
adapting
different
standards
for
discrimination
under
title
vii
then
were
previously
known
in
1964
under
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
at
first;
there
is
no
discrimination
in
the
retirement
plan.
the
facts
are
simple,
males
and
females
receive
the
same
gross
salary
but
the
department
simply
withholds
more
for
retirement
from
the
female
salary
than
from
the
males
because
all
the
mortality
experience
and
more
particularly
the
department's
mortality
experience
show
that
women
have
a
greater
life
expectancy.
this
is
true
at
all
ages
and
of
course,
it
is
true
in
retirement.
it
is
impossible
to
test
or
determine
individual
life
expectancy,
there
is
no
way
you
contest
for
it
so
you
have
to
fund
based
on
group
mortality
experience.
group
mortality
experience
showing
that
women
will
receive
far
more
pay
outs
than
men;
you
have
only
three
ways
of
doing
it.
given
the
greater
life
expectancy
of
females
over
males,
you
can
either
have
the
females
pay
the
additional
cost
of
their
life
expectancy
or
you
can
have
the
employer
pay
it
or
the
females
and
the
employer
together
or
you
can
have
the
male
subsidize
the
females.
in
the
department’s
plan,
the
females
pay
slightly
higher
contribution
than
the
males
and
that
was
matched
by
the
department
110
percent
so
that
the
department
also
paid
more
to
females
than
the
males.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
it
is
possible
but
our
current
actuarial
statistic
seem
to
indicate
that
the
difference
between
whites
and
non-whites
which
is
the
only
racial
characteristics
that
i
have
seen
studies
on
indicate
that
they
are
getting
closer
and
closer.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
later
years
over
the
70s,
it
may
be
that
the
non-whites
are
actually
outliving
the
whites.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
sometime
back
they
were,
they
are
not
now.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
know
your
honor
because
this
case
came
under
title
vii
and
it
came
under
the
sex
qualifications
of
title
vii
and
congress
intended
to
treat
sex
in
compensation
entirely
different
than
racing
compensation.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
believe
so.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
true.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
in
the
compensation
area,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor,
there
is
the
bennett
amendment
to
sections
703(h)
which
very
specifically
incorporates
the
equal
pay
act
into
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act
intended
allowing
pension
differentials
to
continue.
there
is
a
quite
difference,
i
think
your
honor
between
race
and
sex
in
terms
of
longevity.
it
is
very
clear
that
in
the
sex
area,
this
is
more
than
just
something
that
may
be
cultural
as
the
blacks
for
example
becomes
more
and
more
a
part
of
the
middle
classes
in
our
society
so
their
life
expectancies
are
pulling
together.
the
reverse
is
true
with
females
as
more
and
more
come
into
the
workforce,
their
life
expectancy
is
expanding.
our
own
department
experience
as
the
appendix
shows
is
that
the
women
are
actually
living
longer
than
the
men
as
they
come
into
the
workforce.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
there
may
be
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
know.
i
think
there
have
been
some
constructive
that
would
be
a
group
statistic
including
everybody.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
they
do
distinguish
between
men
and
women
in
the
insurance
industry
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
did
not
recognize
the
name
of
the
table
your
honor.
i
apologize.(inaudible)
on
the
actuary
do
distinguish
because
you
are
talking
about
apples
and
oranges
trying
to
fund.
if
you
go
into
a
single
table,
what
you
do
for
funding
purposes
of
annuities
essentially
is
you
make
the
male
subsidize
the
females.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor,
if
it
were
affirmed.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct
too
your
honor.
the
difference
is
this
that
of
the
males
who
die
younger
that
subsidize
that
males
that
die
older.
at
the
time
that
they
purchase
the
annuity,
they
have
an
equal
life
expectancy
that
is
not
true
between
the
male
and
the
female
at
the
time
of
purchase
of
annuity.
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
seek
is
not
equality
but
more
than
equality,
greater
benefits
than
the
males.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
this
court
did
not
award
the
pregnancy
benefits
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
it
did
award
the
seniority.
but
i
think
the
distinction
there
is
that
the
court
was
talking
about
section
703(a)(2)
of
title
vii.
particularly,
equal
employment
opportunity
and
status
as
opposed
to
section
703(a)(1)
where
we
are
talking
about
compensation,
i
think
there
is
a
tremendous
difference.
one
is
depriving
the
individual
of
work
the
other
is
a
difference
in
compensation.
of
course
we
are
not
saying
here
that
there
was
inequitable
treatment,
the
treatment
was
actuarially
equal.
there
is
no
way
to
have
identical
treatment
and
come
out
equitably
for
males
and
females.
it
is
just
like
the
gilbert
case,
it
is
actuarially.
i
guess
the
best
way
of
putting
would
be
not
facially
neutral
but
factually
neutral
because
the
males
and
the
females
paid
the
same
proportion,
the
same
percentage
of
their
total
contributions
for
retirement
plan
and
would
actuarially
end
up
with
the
same
benefits.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
they
receive
the
same
gross
pay,
they
receive
different
take
home
but
on
a
periodic
basis
at
the
same
time
as
they
are
receiving
different
take
homes,
the
females
are
actually
getting
more
because
the
department
was
contributing
more
into
the
retirement
plan
for
them,
it
is
just
an.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
they
get
their
retirement
contributions
back
plus
interest.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
well,
only
if
they
retire
and
they
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct,
plus
the
interest
that
is
earned
and
that
is
true
of
any
contingency
retirement
plan.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
i
said
factually
neutral.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no.
it
is
not
discriminatory,
it
is
different
and
i
will
grant
you
that
but
it
is
not
discriminatory
because
the
treatment
is
equitable.
the
package
it
is,
the
package
that
is
for
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
that
is
partially
correct.
i
think
beyond
that,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
total
value
of
package
of
what
the
employee
is
getting
and
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
i
say
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
for
two
reasons,
one
because
we
were
not
discriminating
because
of
the
equal
value
if
you
will
of
the
packages.
the
female
actually
gets
more
dollars
and
cents
in
value
but
it
is
equal
in
terms
of
actuarial.
but
more
than
that,
because
the
bennett
amendment
itself
to
section
703(h)
and
in
fact
says
that,
“shall
not
be
an
non-law
employment
practice
to
differentiate
on
that
basis
of
sex
in
determining
the
amount
paid
or
to
be
paid
in
compensation
or
wages
so
long
as
it
is
allowed
by
the
equal
pay
act.”
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
this
was
allowed
by
equal
pay
act.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
they
do
your
honor
in
bowman
v.
franks,
this
court
said
the
whole
of
section
703(h)
was
definitional
of
the
act
and
i
think
that
is
what
congress
intended.
equal
pay
act
does
not
require
equal
amounts
of
compensation,
it
is
not
an
economically,
it
is
not
designed
to
takeover
an
employers
business
and
say
this
is
the
level
of
compensation
you
will
provide.
all
it
does
is
it
prohibits
payment
of
different
rates
of
wages
between
the
sexes
based
on
work
where
there
is
no
other
factor
other,
than
sex
as
a
basis
for
the
differential.
this
particular
case,
the
department
pays
the
same
gross
salary
schedule
and
to
that
extent,
the
wage
rate
is
the
same.
take
home
is
a
less
but
as
we
pointed
out
the
contribution
is
not
lost,
it
is
merely
differ
to
a
later
time
and
at
that
same
time,
large
and
matching
amount
is
paid
on
behalf
of
the
females
for
retirement.
if
we
turned
around
and
gave
the
gross
salary
to
the
males
and
the
females
and
said,
“go
and
buy
your
own
annuity”,
private
industry
would
charge
the
females
more
than
the
males.
we
would
not
have
violated
title
vii;
we
would
be
paying
them
the
same
gross
salary.
the
only
difference
between
that
situation
and
our
situation
is
that
the
department
is
providing
the
plan
instead
doing
what
is
proper
in
private
industry
and
in
addition
is
contributing
extra
money
for
the
female
and
for
the
male.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
we
have
complaints;
i
think
we
have
about
three
complaints
to
the
eeoc
by
male
groups
on
different.
the
one
that
is
in
the
appendix
by
the
architects
and
engineers’
association,
we
really
do
not
know
what
they
are
complaining
about
at
this
point
because
we
have
not
received
a
complaint
but
essentially
what
their
cause
is
that
benefits
and
contributions
are
unequal.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
well
all
that
the
state
law
has
said
is
that
we
must
equalize,
what
we
have
done
in
order
to
comply
with
that
is
the
department
has
paid
the
difference,
we
have
essentially
foot
the
bill.
i
think
an
employer
can
do
that,
pay
additional
if
he
wants
to
foot
that
bill
but
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
well,
title
vii,
i
think
deals
with
differences
in
compensation
that
take
you
to
the
equal
pay
act
which
talks
about
wages.
if
wages
does
not
include
pensions
then
i
do
not
think
we
do
not
have
any
problem.
i
think
the
problem
that
arises
is
probably
the
equal
pay
act
problem
that
we
are
paying
more
total
compensation
to
males.
i
am
sorry
to
females
than
to
males
because
we
are
paying
the
difference
and
the
question
is
whether
that
violates
the
equal
pay
act
and
that
is
another
question
down
the
road.
i
think
the
question
here
is
whether
we
were
violating
title
vii.
the
fact
that
we
may
have
equalized
because
we
are
required
to
by
state
law,
i
do
not
think
that
indicates
that
we
were
violating
the
statute
before,
i
do
not
think
we
were,
we
were
treating
both
equitably.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
one
of
those
guardian
knots
that
the
court
is
going
to
be
faced
with,
the
males
on
one
side
or
the
females
on
the
other.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
that
would
be
true
unless
they
were
getting
into
tenth
amendment
area.
that
would
depend
on
whether
you
are
talking
about
civil
rights
or
simply
regulating
commerce.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
used
unisex
tables
your
honor
because
there
the
males
would
be
paying
for
the
females.
i
think
the
difference,
this
is
my
own
personal
view,
the
difference
is
that
here
the
employer
is
paying
the
extra
himself
but
it
does
impact
on
males
and
we
will
be
faced
with
that
potential
lawsuit
for
males
as
the
state
of
california
is.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct
your
honor.
it
is
just
as
much
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
treat
things
that
are
dissimilar
as
equals
as
it
is
to
treat
things
that
are
equals
is
a
dissimilar
fashion.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
the
argument
could
be
made
your
honor
but
it
does
not
make
sense
in
terms
of
annuities
because.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
true
your
honor
but
if
i
were
a
smoker,
well
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
i
am
going
to
buy
an
annuity
and
they
will
give
me
a
lower
rate
because
i
am
a
smoker,
i
will
come
in
as
a
smoker
and
a
drinker
and
an
overweight,
whatever
i
can
do
get
the
lowest
rate.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no
your
honor
because
these
factors
are
within
the
control
of
the
individual.
i
can
stop
smoking
tomorrow.
i
can
stop
drinking
tomorrow,
the
day
after
i
bought
my
annuity.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
you
have
to
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
they
do
your
honor.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
difference
between
insurance
and
annuity.
in
insurance,
the
risk
of
smoking
or
drinking
or
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
know
of
any
but
there
may
be
your
honor.
that
sells
annuities
that
are
cheaper
for
smokers.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
would
think
that
is
a
public
service
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
were
to
provide
lower
rates
in
an
annuity
policy
for
smoking,
drinking
and
overweight
you
would
be
encouraging
bad
health.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
one
of
the
problems
of
equalizing.
if
you
are
in
a
system
as
many
are
where
they
allow
you
to
take
annuity
or
a
lump
sum
alternative
then
if
unisex
is
the
mandate
of
thing
the
males
will
take
the
lump
sum
as
he
is
going
to
come
out
better.
if
you
go
out
and
buy
a
private
annuity
and
the
female
will
take
the
annuity
because
she
will
come
out
better,
the
result
would
be
the.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
argument
i
think
can
be
made
but
there
is
no
statistics
to
fare
it
out
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
has
been
our
experience
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
all
that
i
have
seen
of
actuarial
studies
has
shown
that
the
more
females
that
come
in
to
workforce,
the
longer
the
life
expectancy
they
have.
and
i
see
nothing
to
show
that
the
stress
jobs
make
any
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
those
areas
where
males
and
females
have
similar
jobs
such
as
in
teaching
the
difference
seems
to
carry
on
the
same,
the
statistics
that
teaches
insurance,
one
of
the
(inaudible)
indicate
that
the
female
teachers
live
just
as
much
longer
and
the
male
teachers.
females
in
the
general
population
leave
longer
than
males.
i
think
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
address
very
quickly
the
administrative
agency
point
first
that
was
made.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
has
been
the
chopping
and
changing
opinions
of
the
eeoc.
and
it
is
not
true
but,
1966
opinion
letter
of
charles
duncan
was
the
only
time
the
eeoc
said
that
they
would
follow
the
practice
of
unequal
contributions
to
support
equal
benefits
or
equal
contributions
to
support
unequal
benefits,
which
is
what
the
department
of
labors
bulletin
800.151
recognizes.
in
our
brief,
in
our
apply
brief
at
the
court
of
appeal
level,
we
referred
to
a
speech
that
was
delivered
to
the
industrial
relations
research
association
on
april
16th
of
1969.
when
sonia
pressman,
senior
attorney
of
the
office
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
eeoc
stated,
that
commission
to
date
has
also
followed
the
equal
contributions
or
equal
benefit
standards
of
the
labor
department.

paragraph,

mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
think
they
reflected
a
change
in
view
until
about
1972.
problem
is
that
the
department
of
labor
specifically
in
its
guidelines
and
eeoc
at
least
through
its
general
counsel
recognized
you
have
got
to
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
true.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
think
it
is
indicative
of
the
way
the
the
commission
feels.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
true.but
it
is
indicative
that
at
least,
--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
to
indicate
the
eeoc
has
taken
different
propositions.
that
its
staff
has
taken
positions.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
more
than
one
member
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
well,
the
first
was
the
general
counsel,
robert
duncan.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
charles
duncan.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
well,
the
guidelines
of
the
department
of
labor
specifically
recognized
this
problem
and
allowed
either
or
the
equal
benefits
or
equal
contributions
solution.
the
other
guideline
of
the
department
of
labor
and
it
is
just
that,
a
guideline,
nothing
more,
an
interpreted
bulletin
800.151
says,
that
cost
may
not
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
fringe
benefits
for
males
or
of
females
and
that
particular
guideline
is
plainly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
where
both
houses
said
that
costs
of
employment
of
females
maybe
taken
into
account.
that
legislative
history
is
in
the
back
of
our
opening
brief
you
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
the
older
age
would
make
the
higher
contribution
because
there
is
a
less
period
of
time
to
accumulate
sufficient
funds
to
pay
for
your
retirement.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
because
you
are
retiring
at
65
either.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
from
35
he
does
but
not,
that
they
are
all
retiring
at
the
same
age
of
60
or
65.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
right.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
a
higher
contribution.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
right.
no,
he
is
paying
for
the
same
retirement.
he
is
going
to
get
the
same
result
but
he
is
only,
anybody’s
got
that
fewer
years
that
to.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
right.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
well
--.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
right
and
then.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
we
take
the
contribution
and
the
14.84%
was
just
an
average
which
was
figured
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit,
that
longevity
is
a
function
of
age
and
sex.
and
in
order
to
determine
that,
we
would
go
to
the
actuarial
tables.
and
from
the
actuarial
tables,
it
is
factored
into
the
contribution
rate.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
i
do
not
think
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no
your
honor
because--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
the
interrogatories
may
but
i
do
not
think
they
do
your
honor.
this
came
up
on
summary
judgment
and--
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
they
made
the
motion
and
conceded
the
accuracy
of
the
actuarial
tables
in
the
good
faith
of
the
department.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
years
of
service
and
the
retirement
age.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
and
salary
level,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
no,
the
last
year
of
the
service,
the
final
average
salary
for
the
last
year
of
service
multiplied
by
2%
or,
it
is
a
little
higher
now,
2.1%
for
each
year
of
service.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
yes.
mr.
david
j.
oliphant
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
recognize
in
closing
is
that,
it
is
not
just
sex,
it
is
sex
plus
age
longevity
and
that
as
in
gilbert
is
a
factor
other
than
sex
just
as
pregnancy
was.
