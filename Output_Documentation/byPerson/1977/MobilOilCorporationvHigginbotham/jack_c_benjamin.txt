mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
the
very
beginning
that
my
client
mrs.
shinn
one
of
the
respondents,
her
decedent
was
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
jones
act,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
the
general
maritime
law
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit,
as
distinguished
from
mrs.
higginbotham
whose
decedent
was
not
found
to
be
a
seaman.
so
with
regard
to
the
issue
presented
upon
review
by
this
court
and
i
read,
if
i
may
take
the
time,
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
question,
whether
the
maritime
cause
of
action
for
death
occurring
within
a
state's
territorial
waters,
created
by
this
court
in
moragne,
completely
replaces
the
statutory
cause
of
action
for
death,
mandated
by
congress
with
respect
to
deaths
occurring
within
the
geographical
scope
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
may
not
dispose
of
the
shinn
matter.
what
may
dispose
of
the
higginbotham
matter.
now
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
petitioner
to
ask
the
court
to
consider
both
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
jones
act
in
relation
to
the
moragne
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
and
we
have
so
treated
that
in
our
brief,
but
i
really
worried
to
make
reference
to
that
to
the
court.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
but
petitioner
if
you
read
the
question
presented
literally
it
says
the
statutory
cause
of
action.
it
does
not
say
statutory
causes
of
action,
and
the
petitioner,
no
doubt
about
it,
is
addressing
itself
to
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
(inaudible)
as
if
may
we
are
not
urging
this
court
not
to
consider
the
jones
act
in
relation
to
the
moragne
cause
of
action.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
pointed
out
and
this
court
has
accepted
the
question
of
review
as
to
whether
or
not
the
moragne
cause
of
action
replaces
completely
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
or
whether
or
not
it
is
necessary
to
relegate
it
to
the
briney
deep.
we
believe
that
the
real
issue
is
not
whether
that
the
moragne
cause
of
action
replaces
a
statutory
act
of
congress
but
whether
or
not
it
can
recognize
as
the
court
we
think
did
in
moragne
case.
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
under
the
general
maritime
law
which
can
augment,
complement,
and
supplement
the
existing
federal
statutes,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
that
its
decision
in
moragne
did
just
that.
in
overruling
the
harrisburg,
the
court
must
reflect
back.
the
harrisburg
a
case
in
the
late
80's
and
80's
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
under
the
general
maritime
law
wherever
the
wrongful
death
occurred
so
long
as
the
death
occurred
within
waters
under
federal
jurisdiction,
both
within
and
without
the
three
mile
limit.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
no
sir,
it
was
not
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
harrisburg
involved,
as
i
recall
it,
a
collision
which
occurred
off
the
coast
of
massachusetts,
somewhere
between
the
coast
of
massachusetts
and
martha's
vineyard.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
really
was
territorial
waters
on
the
high
seas,
but
in
any
event
over
the
years
the
courts
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
harrisburg
has
prohibited
or
had
prohibited
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
under
the
maritime
law.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
precisely,
i
think
the
petitioner
has
overstated
the
problem
when
petitioner
suggested
in
its
brief
that
this
court
has
not
the
right
to
relegate
an
act
of
congress
to
the
scrappy,
petitioner
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
honorable
court
has
the
right
if
not
the
duty
to
reverse
prior
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
which
it
feels
are
wrong
or
inappropriate
or
for
whatever
reason,
and
that
is
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
think
there
mr.
justice
white
that
there
would
have
been
a
jurisprudential
disaster.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
congress
certainly
has
the
right
to
do
that
by
statute,
but
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
itself
because
we
differ
very
greatly
from
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
what
congress
intended
to
do.
now
this
court
combed
the
legislative
history
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
moragne
case,
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
go
through
all
of
the
ramification,
but
i
really
point
to
what
was
noted
in
section
7
of
the
act.
when
the
petitioner
read
to
you
the
provisions
of
the
act,
petitioner
omitted
this
portion
of
the
statute
which
says
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
chapter
and
this
language
resulted
after
great
debate
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
where
there
was
some
language
in
this
amendment
which
restricted
the
state
statutes
to
territorial
limits
and
that
language
was
excluded.
so
we
believe
this
act
was
passed
by
congress.
it
was
really
to
confer
a
jurisdiction
in
federal
court
which
had
not
existed
before
1920.
it
was
not
a
grade
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
because
those
statutes,
which
had
been
passed
by
the
state
which
could
have
applied
to
the
high
seas
were
still
permitted
to
by
the
very
language
in
the
statute
that
i
just
read
to
the
court.
now
if
your
honors
inquired
of
me
which
states
had
such
statutes
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
answer
the
question
obviously.
there
must
have
been
some
whic
did
because
there
would
not
have
been
necessity
for
the
discussion
in
the
house
when
the
legislation
was
debated.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
i
do
not
know
that
that
issue
had
ever
been
presented
to
this
court
your
honor,
but
i
am
under
the
impression
that
some
states
did
have
statutes
which
permitted
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
know
that
now
i
am
not
so
sure
the
congress
over
the
years
has
recognized
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
so
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
limit
recovery
to
pecuniary
loss.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
no,
that
is
a
statutory
limitation
of
the
act
itself
and
the
jones
act
limitation
on
damages
is
limited
to
pecuniary
loss,
but
the
two
statutes
have
never
been
held
to
be
exclusive.
they
have
been
implementing
one
another
and
the
courts
have
used
them
to
implement
one
another
over
the
years.
a
jones
act
seaman
had
called
upon
the
provisions
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
when
appropriate
for
a
remedy
for
on
sea
worthiness.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
mr.
justice
white
as
we
attempted
to
point
up
to
the
court
in
our
brief.
fortunately,
the
maritime
law
has
involved
with
an
interrelationship
between
statutory
law
and
decisional
law,
and
it
has
been
implemented
over
the
years
and
delicately
sometimes
not
so
delicately
woven
into
a
flexible
fabric
to
cover
an
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
thank
you
sir.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
yesterday,
i
believe,
i
was
attempting
to
answer
a
question
from
mr.
justice
white.
i
was
seeking
to
remind
the
court
of
how
the
maritime
law
has
evolved
over
the
decades
by
an
interrelationship
of
both
nonstatutory
and
statutory
law,
decisional
law,
augmenting
statutory
law.
the
jones
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
state
statutes
have
all
been
complementing
one
another
over
a
period
of
years.
further,
i
believe
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
the
gaudet
case
and
i
have
read
just
briefly
from
footnote
22.
i
am
taking
it
out
of
context.
"nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
act
suggest
that
congress
intended
the
act's
statutory
major
of
damages
to
preempt
any
additional
elements
of
damage,
for
a
maritime
wrongful
death
remedy
which
this
court
might
mean
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
general
maritime
law."
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
death
on
the
high
seas
act
sir.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
one
further
point
about
the
exclusivity
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
i
refer
the
court
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
no,
your
honor
it
would
not
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
yes,
it
is
dicta.
it
is
not
really
part
of
the
ratio
decidendi
the
case
yes
sir,
but
it
is
illustrative
of
what
the
court's
feeling
was
concerning
the
applicability
of
the
general
maritime
law
beyond
territorial
limits?
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
did
take
out
of
context.
i
said
i
did
so
to
save
the
time.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
it
was
not
intended
by
congress.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
there
was
your
honor
before
the
harrisburg.
prior
to
the
harrisburg
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
believe
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
dealing
with
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
inimical
in
the
interest
of
the
maritime
law
to
complementing
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
by
nonstatutory
damages
and
that
is
the
context
in
which
i
believe
this
footnote
is
written.
further,
the
language
of
the
act
itself
may
indicate
that
the
act
is
not
intended
to
be
exclusive
because
section
764
reveals
that
with
respect
to
elements
of
damages
recoverable
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
by
expressed
provision
the
incorporation
of
foreign
law
is
permitted
to
supplement
the
damages
recoverable
under
the
act.
so
that
if
an
accident
occurred
involving
a
japanese
shipping
company,
for
instance,
and
the
law
of
japan
permitted
the
recovery
of
nonpecuniary
losses,
a
seaman,
in
those
circumstances
and
his
survivors,
could
then
augment
the
pecuniary
losses
provided
for
under
the
jones
act
and
death
on
the
high
seas
act
by
the
law
of
japan.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
to
answer
you
on
this
question
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
the
general
maritime
law
concepts
would
be
broad
enough
to
cover
most
of
the
provisions
under
the
act,
except
for
those
which
have
not
been
defined
by
a
jurisprudential
development,
such
as
statutes
of
limitations,
beneficiaries
and
alike.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
no
it
would
not.
in
my
opinion
the
doctrine
of
laches
would
apply
to
a
marine
type
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
your
honor's
question
addresses
itself
to
the
separation
of
powers
account
for
in
constitution,
and
i
respectfully
attempt
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
by
saying
that
in
the
maritime
field,
the
courts
have
filled
the
void.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
but
congress'
action
does
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
as
i
thought
the
court
answered
in
the
gaudet
case
there
was
nothing
in
the
act,
which
prevented
the
act
from
being
augmented
by
decisions
permitting
additional
elements
of
damage.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
the
legislative
created
cause
of
action,
may
it
please
mr.
chief
justice,
was
intended
to
create
a
jurisdiction,
in
a
jurisdiction
only
in
the
federal
court.
now,
the
measure
of
damages
was
held
to
be
adequate,
was
throught
to
be
adequate
by
the
congress
in
both
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
jones
act,
but
the
maritime
law
was
a
constantly
moving
body
of
law.
it
was
a
constantly
advancing
body
of
law.
today
every
state
in
the
union
has
wrongful
death
statutes,
and
every
state
in
the
union
--
i
withdraw
that
--
and
the
majority
of
those
wrongful
death
statutes
permit
the
recovery
of
nonpecuniary
losses.
so,
it
does
not
offend
my
sense
of
justice
for
the
court
to
augment
statutory
elements
of
damage
by
nonstatutory
elements
of
damage.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
maritime
law
has
always
held
a
special
solicitude
for
seaman
and
for
those
who
garb
the
hazards
of
the
sea
and
has
always
sought
to
give
rather
than
to
withhold
a
remedy.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
because
time
has
changed
and
social
concepts
changed,
and
the
maritime
law
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
the
fact
that
most
of
the
states,
the
majority
of
the
states,
have
provisions
in
the
wrongful
death
or
acts
which
allow
the
recovery
of
nonpecuniary
losses.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
well,
of
course
the
congress
has
not
acted
since
1920
and
i
am
not
sure
there
has
been
any
movement
for
legislation
concerning
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
recent
years.
there
has
been
with
regard
to
the
jones
act,
i
am
aware
of.
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
another
point
the
petitioner
raises.
if
this
court
restricts
the
applicability
of
the
maritime
law
to
territorial
allowance,
the
three
mile
limit,
it
may
then
return
to
what
is
known
as
a
locality
test
which
was
denounced
by
the
court
as
a
test
alone
at
least
for
jurisdictional
purposes
in
the
executive
jet
case
by
way
of
illustration.
a
widow
of
a
seaman
who
was
fairly
injured
as
a
result
of
the
breach
of
a
maritime
duty
within
the
three
mile
limit
could
recover
nonpecuniary
losses
and
the
widow
of
the
seaman
who
was
fairly
injured
on
the
high
seas
as
a
result
of
the
breach
of
same
maritime
duty
could
not.
this
is
basically
unfair.
it
illustrated
further
those
are
always
aware
of
the
amount
of
field
activity
off
the
coast
to
louisiana.
boats
and
ships
are
constantly
moving
from
the
shore
line
and
to
the
high
seas.
it
would
impose
a
most
onerous
burden
upon
litigant.
if
he
were
entitled
or,
if
his
survivors
were
entitled
to
recover
nonpecuniary
losses
within
the
three
mile
limit
and
the
litigants
were
not
positive
of
where
the
injury
or
death
occurred.
louisiana's
coastline
as
your
honors
know
from
arguments
in
other
cases
involving
boundaries
of
meander,
islands
appear,
disappear
and
reappear,
and
it
is
quite
difficult
to
ascertain
for
a
litigant
where
the
boundaries
are.
in
addition,
the
locality
test
is
just
in
basis
and
unfair
and
unrealistic
test.
now,
i
would
like
to
touch
just
briefly
upon
the
court's
decision
in
the
barbe
case
which
petitioner
brought
out.
the
barbe
case
concerned
itself
with
the
survival
provisions
of
the
general
maritime
law.
barbe
court
recognized
the
existence,
and
i
use
that
language
because
i
believe
what
this
court
did
in
moragne
was
recognized
the
existence.
it
restored
what
was
once
known
as
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
under
the
general
maritime
law.
it
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action.
the
barbe
court
recognized
the
cause
of
action.
under
the
survival
provisions
of
the
general
maritime
law
using
the
same,
reasoning
the
same
methodology
as
this
court
did
in
moragne
and
gaudet.
it
allowed
recovery
for
conscious
pain
and
suffering
of
the
decedent,
but
denied
recovery
of
funeral
expenses
for
some
reason
which
has
been
categorized
as
absurd
by
some
on
the
basis
that
funeral
expenses
would
have
been
incurred
at
some
future
date
anyway
and
of
course
if
that
logic
would
carry
out,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
wrongful
death
acts
because
people
are
bound
to
reach
the
terminal
stage
with
life.
we
think
the
decision
of
the
barbe
court
was
completely
illogical
and
would
create
additional
anomalies
than
those
which
existed
pre
moragne.
finally,
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
gaudet
decision.
the
principal
reasons
for
dissent
by
some
members
of
the
panel
of
this
court
in
gaudet
were
present
in
the
gaudet
case
and
do
not
exist
in
this
case
or
in
these
cases.
in
first
place
no
suit
was
brought
by
the
decedent
prior
to
death
presumably
decedents
were
killed
instantaneously
and
there
is
no
problem
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel.
secondly,
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
double
recovery
as
the
court
was
concerned
with.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
it
would
apply
your
honor
yes.
as
i
said
the
recovery
for
losses
society
--
although
not
permitted
under
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act
and
death
on
the
high
seas
act
or
permitted
by
statutes
of
most
states
and
consistent
with
the
advance
of
the
maritime
law
and
its
special
solicitude
--
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
did
not
hear
the
last
part
of
your
question
sir.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
do
not
believe
they
have
been
your
honor.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
in
recent
years
it
has
not
amended.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
reminding
the
court
that
both
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
jones
act
need
not
be
relegated
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
and
some
of
the
commentators
have
said
to
briney
deep
not
to
scrappy
or
to
the
level
of
nonstatutory
statements.
they
may
remain
as
a
basis
for
recovery
for
pecuniary
losses
and
may
be
augmented
by
the
remedy
annunciated
by
this
court
in
moragne
and
gaudet
for
the
recovery
of
nonpecuniary
losses
with
substantial
uniformity
to
the
law
and
substantial
justice
to
the
litigants.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
i
would
not
claim
that
your
honor.
mr.
jack
c.
benjamin
thank
you
your
honor,
i
choose
not
to.
