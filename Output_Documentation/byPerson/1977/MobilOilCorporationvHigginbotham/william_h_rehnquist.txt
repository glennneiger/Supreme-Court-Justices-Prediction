william
h.
rehnquist
the
harrisburg
was
not
based
on
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
we
freer
to
overrule
a
judicially
created
doctrine
like
the
harrisburg
which
what
you
say,
was
held
the
prohibited
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
than
we
are
to
overrule
a
damaged
limitation
in
an
act
of
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
had
been
applicable
on
the
fact
situation
of
gaudet?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that
was
dicta
that
you
are
just
reading,
wasn't
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
congress'
serving
attempt
to
this
court,
congress
can
enact
a
statue
providing
for
a
specific
limitation
on
admiralty
or
providing
for
a
specific
limitation
on
damages,
and
this
court
can
come
along
and
say,
"we
do
not
care
what
congress
said.
we
like
it
this
way."
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
not
any
void
here.
congress
is
active.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
law
was
both
moving
and
advancing.
i
take
it,
you
mean
something
more
than
change.
by
the
way
that
what
do
you
mean
by
advancing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
is
it
necessary
to
advance
it
all
if
it
is
always
been
this
way?
