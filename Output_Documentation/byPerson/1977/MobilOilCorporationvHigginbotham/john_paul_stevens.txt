justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
one
question
counsel.
you
have
not
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
gaudet
case,
as
i
remmeber
the
name
of
it,
understandably,
when
one
reads
that
opinion
it
seems
to
read
--
it
does
not
seem
to
be
limited
in
its
language
to
the
territorial
waters
although
the
whole
i
know
the
facts
there
roles
within
the
territorial
waters.
do
you
have
anything
to
say
about
gaudet
before
you
go
home?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
assuming
it
is
wrongly
decided.
it
may
be
in
assuming
that
it
is
not
in
fact
in
its
terms
limited.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
i
was
not
here
when
gaudet
was
decided.
should
i
--
am
i
to
follow
as
to
my
(inaudible)
to
this
regard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
pursue
it
just
a
little
more
in
a
serious
level
too.
what
part
justice
harlan's
rationale
in
the
moragne
case
was
a
desire
for
uniformity
throughout
and
both
parts
of
the
high
seas?
now
are
we
possibly
in
the
position
where
in
order
to
achieve
uniformity
we
must
read
gaudet
literally
and
apply
it
in
the
same
area
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
had
applied.
but
how
do
we
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
take
it
out
of
context,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
some
to
take
you
through
(inaudible)
mr.
benjamin?
how
could
congress
then
had
been
trying
preempt
the
cause
of
action
that
had
been
decided,
didn't
exists
in
1920?
that
footnote,
as
you
read
it,
says
that
the
congress
was
not
trying
to
be
preclude
some
additional
damage
remedy
on
the
high
seas.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
it
be
intended
by
congress?
there
was
just
no
cause
of
action
at
all
and
here
it
covered
by
the
statute,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
over
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
harrisburg
had
been
decided,
so
there
is
no
cause
of
action,
so
how
couldn't
congress
had
been
deciding
anything
about
damages
except
what
it
puts
in
the
statute,
it
has
been
enacting.
i
just
do
not
--
i
do
not
quite
understand
how
this
footnote
even
helps
you
even
reading
it
the
way
you
do.
might
be
i
have
missed
something,
i
do
not
know.
it
was
a
very
confusing
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
benjamin
let
me
ask
another
question?
supposing
you
are
right
we
rule
it,
and
then
supposing
that
day
after
the
court
decides
you
are
right,
congress
repeal
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
would
that
affect
any
change
in
the
law?
(inaudible)
all
of
that
statute
if
we
agree
with
you?
any
need
for
it
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
on
statute
limitation
if
you
are
right
--
that
statute
of
limitation
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
not
necessarily
bar
a
marine
type
action,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
benjamin,
even
though
those
facts
are
arguably
would
apply
to
your
reasoning
within
the
whole
concept
of
gaudet
applied
in
high
seas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
there
been
any
suggestions
to
congress
that
the
congress
amended
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
as
for
the
times
as
you
would
go?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
wrongful
death
case
arising
out
of
a
fatal
accident
on
the
high
seas.
the
question
is
whether
damages
may
be
recovered
for
loss
of
society
as
well
as
pecuniary
loss.
congress
has
enacted
a
statute
which
only
authorizes
the
recovery
of
pecuniary
damages
when
the
death
occurs
more
than
three
miles
from
shore.
inside
the
three-mile
limit,
where
the
statue
does
not
apply,
this
court
has
held,
the
damages
for
loss
of
society
can
also
be
recovered.
in
this
case,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
held
at
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
on
a
high
seas
because
we
are
persuaded
that
the
courts
must
apply
the
standard
selected
by
congress.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
