a
case
can
be
--
it
says
a
death
occurring
within
the
geographical
scope
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
might
or
might
not
be
also
covered
by
the
jones
act
depending
upon
whether
the
decedent
was
a
seaman,
right?

both
would
be
within
the
geographical
scope
on
of
the

but
no
state
would
have
had
the
power,
would
it,
to
enact
the
laws
creating
liability
for
injuries
of
death
that
occurred
outside
that
state's
territory
including
its
territorial
waters?
justice
potter
stewart
which
purported
to
(inaudible)
of
the
court
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
power.
sovereignty
only
can
enact
laws
applicable
within
its
territorial
jurisdiction
and
the
high
seas
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
anyone
of
our
domestic
states.
justice

know
that,
yes.
