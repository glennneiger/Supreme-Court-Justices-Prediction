was
not
the
footnote
just
addressed
to
whether
death
on
the
high
seas
act
foreclosed
this
extra
item
of
damages
within
the
state's
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
those
are
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
that
never
had
been
necessary
to
overrule
harrisburg,
suppose
that
all
had
been
in
a
wrongful
death
action
on
the
high
seas,
and
then
congress
pass
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
saying
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
an
act
for
the
death
on
the
high
seas
shall
lie
and
following
damages
shall
be
recoverable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
but
could
the
court
go
on
then
say,
well,
nevertheless
we
are
going
to
allow
recovery
of
more
than
pecuniary
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
congressional
statutes
are
usually
given
as
much
place
each
of
them
can,
but
we
are
talking
here
about
a
judicial
rule.
these
are
the
congressional
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
there
been
any
suggestions
to
congress
that
congress
catches
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
up
to
the
modern
trend?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
time
that
has
not
amended.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
statute
keeps
this
court
from
reversing
itself
and
utterly
doing
away
with
a
cause
of
action
for
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
that
is
at
least
the
function
of
the
statute.
