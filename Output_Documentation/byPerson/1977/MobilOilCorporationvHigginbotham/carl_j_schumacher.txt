mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
mobil
oil
corporation,
the
petitioner.
the
facts
that
bring
us
to
this
point
in
this
suit
are
really
simple.
indeed
i
do
not
believe
that
any
facts
are
in
dispute
at
this
stage
of
these
proceedings.
on
august
15,
1967
four
men
were
killed
when
a
helicopter
in
which
they
were
riding
crashed
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
after
leaving
a
fixed
platform
not
official
island,
and
returning
toward
the
shoreline.
the
crash
occurred
some
100
miles
off
the
louisiana
coast.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
on
three
theories
by
the
plaintiffs
seeking
a
remedy
for
death
damages
based
upon
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
damages
under
the
jones
act,
and
damages
under
the
general
maritime
law.
the
issue
before
this
court
and
the
sole
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
court
in
moragne
to
use
judge
brown's
language
consigned
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
the
briney
deep.
did
this
court
by
moragne
reduce
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
the
scrappy
or
reduce
it
to
the
level
of
a
nonstatutory
restatement
as
professors
gilmore
and
black
have
said,
suggested
a
question.
our
submission
is
that
clearly
justice
harlan
in
the
opinion
in
moragne
did
not
intend
to
do
so.
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
beyond
any
possibility
or
doubt
that
this
court
in
moragne
did
not
decide
more
than
it
had
to.
and
when
justice
harlan
wrote
we
conclude
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
not
intended
to
preclude
the
availability
of
a
remedy
for
wrongful
death
under
general
maritime
law
in
situations
not
covered
by
the
act.
we
specifically
decline
or
this
court
specifically
decline
to,
by
moragne,
repeal
or
nullify
a
circumvent
dohsa.
the
case
comes
before
your
honors
because
of
the
conflict
in
the
opinions
of
the
first
circuit
in
barbe
versus
drummond
and
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
law
versus
sea
drilling.
question
arises
because
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
instant
case,
the
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
heard
higginbotham
et
al.
decided
that
it
was
precluded
from
deciding
for
itself
whether
or
not
moragne
nullified
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
it
said
it
was
precluded
by
its
own
rules
that
required
it
to
follow
the
decision
of
an
earlier
panel
in
the
law
case.
in
law,
judge
brown
speaking
for
the
fifth
circuit
says
no
longer
does
one
need
a
state
remedy.
no
longer
does
one
need
a
state
court
or
the
admiralty
as
a
court
or
dohsa
as
a
remedy.
there
is
a
federal
maritime
cause
of
action
but
death
on
navigable
waters
--
any
navigable
waters
--
and
it
can
be
enforced
in
any
court.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
he
was
including
your
honor
the
three
mile
limit
which
clearly
there
was
good
authority
for
him
to
do
so,
but
the
facts
in
law
involve
deaths
beyond
the
three
mile
limit
as
did
the
facts
in
barbe
versus
drummond.
the
first
circuit
addressing
itself
to
the
identical
question,
came
to
just
the
opposite
conclusion.
the
court
in
barbe
said,
"since
dohsa
clearly
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
this
case,
we
fail
to
see
how
moragne
applies.
we
hold
that
the
major
of
damage
for
wrongful
death
provided
by
dohsa,
namely
pecuniary
loss,
controls
in
the
instant
case."
both
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
in
the
briefs
before
the
court,
have
addressed
themselves
to
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
passing
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
i
submit
to
court
that
the
statute
itself
demonstrates
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
be
the
exclusive
remedy
for
death
actions
occurring
or
where
death
occurs
more
than
three
miles
out
of
the
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
it
reached
whenever
the
death
of
a
person
shall
because
by
wrongful
act
neglect
the
default
occurring
on
the
high
seas
beyond
the
marine
league
from
shore,
the
personal
representatives
of
the
decedent
may
maintain
a
suit
for
damages.
but
the
damages
provision
which
is
the
provision
which
bars
directly
on
the
higginbotham
case
provides
the
recovery
in
such
suit
shall
be
a
fair
and
just
compensation
for
the
pecuniary
loss
sustained,
and
whether
our
reading
of
the
congressional
record
in
1920
is
correct
and
we
properly
understand
the
intention
of
the
congress,
or
whether
that
suggested
by
the
respondents
is
may
be
debatable,
but
the
language
of
the
statute
certainly
cannot
be
debated
and
the
statute
says
that
the
major
of
damages
shall
be
the
pecuniary
loss.
there
is
no
exception
to
that
command.
i
suppose
your
honors
that
the
petitioner's
argument
really
reduces
itself
to
this.
we
feel
that
in
moragne
the
court
correctly
limited
itself
to
consideration
of
deaths
occurring
within
the
three
mile
limit.
we
feel
that
it
did
not
signal
or
suggest
as
the
fifth
circuit
in
law
guessed
that
the
moragne
decision
applied
beyond
the
three
mile
limit.
on
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
the
statute
itself
mandates
that
it
apply
exclusively
to
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
but
the
moragne
gaudet
remedy
is
to
be
applied
beyond
the
three
mile
limit
would
be
to
totally
emasculate
the
act
of
a
congress.
your
honors
that
is
what
i
have
come
here
to
say
if
any
member
of
the
court
has
question
of
course
i
would
be
glad
to
try
to
speak
to.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
your
honor
i
believe
in
footnote
22
of
gaudet,
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
brennan,
committed
error.
i
believe
the
construction
placed
by
the
majority
in
gaudet
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
in
error.
i
do
not
think
that
really
germane
to
our
case
because
i
think
gaudet
should
have
been
limited
by
rules
of
interpretation
to
the
facts
of
gaudet.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
that
particular
footnote
--
it
was,
and
that
the
case
was
only
limited
to
the
state's
water.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
such
you
do
not
like,
certainly
your
honor.
your
honors,
i
should
say
i
come
from
a
state
where
the
very
first
article
of
civil
code
defines
the
word
'law'
and
it
defines
law
as
a
solemn
expression
of
legislative
will.
coming
with
--
it
was
the
very
first
court
article
i
read
when
i
went
to
the
law
school.
so
coming
from
that
background
and
reading
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
i
am
knowing
that
this
case
involved
the
deaths
that
indeed
occurred
on
the
high
seas
as
defined
by
the
legislature.
i
suppose
that,
i
would
say
qed,
but
in
effect
i
do
not
believe
the
gaudet
footnote
or
the
gaudet
decision
itself
is
necessary
for
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
your
honor.
mr.
justice
marshall
in
my
para
said
whose
ox
is
being
gored,
but
it
is
the
same
mode
of
law.
yes,
but
the
facts
again
in
the
gaudet
do
not
require
the
court
to
decide
anything
more
than
territorial
water
death.
mr.
carl
j.
schumacher,
jr.
your
honor,
certainly
if
there
were
to
be
complete
uniformity
and
all
things,
there
would
be
no
need
for
courts
or
lawyers
or
any
administrative
process.
aas
i
understand
it,
that
is
not
with
the
admiralty
and
maritime
laws
mean
when
it
speaks
of
uniformity.
it
means
uniformity
in
the
matters
of
liability
leading
to
the
decision
as
set
out
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
--
quoted
at
page
20
of
our
brief.
"the
uniformity
that
is
fundamental
in
maritime
law
has
to
deal
with
the
basis
of
liability
not
with
deferring
elements
of
damages
that
may
be
recoverable
in
different
circumstances
with
different
classes
of
beneficiaries."
that
comes
from
the
dennis
(ph)
case.
thank
you
your
honor.
