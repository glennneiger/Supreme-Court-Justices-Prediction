justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
indictment
go
the
jury
room?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
part
of
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
can
find
in
it
then
the
question
as
you
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
shearer
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question
please.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
the
defendant
comes
in
the
court
with
a
clean
slate
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned?
i
did
not
understand
your
argument
about
the
clean
slate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
argued
that
the
instruction
that
the
defendant
tendered
was
not
correct
as
i
understood?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
that?
why
does
not
the
defendant
come
into
court
with
a
clean
slate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
for
purposes
of
the
matter
on
trial
he
was
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
presumed
to
come
in
with
a
clean
slate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
his
charge
was
concerned
did
he
not
have
a
clean
slate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
is
it
the
practice
in
kentucky
if
a
man
has
the
kind
of
clean
slate
where
he
has
never
been
on
probation
or
parole
or
anything
at
all
then
does
he
get
the
instruction?
if
this
man
had
had
the
kind
of
clean
slate
you
have
in
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
he
had
it
completely
clean
slate?
