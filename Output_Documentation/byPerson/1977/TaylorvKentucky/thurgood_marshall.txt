there
are
thousands
of
cases
like

the
one

you
are
the
one
to
set
a
special
rule
where
there
is
only
one
witness
on
the
side,
do
you?
justice
thurgood

then
why

keep
pushing
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
think
that
two
of
them
together
cannot
give
us
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
long
as
we
have
had
common
law
courts,
we
have
had
the
presumption
of
innocence
-
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
and
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
said.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“if
the
court
gives
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
the
court
does
not
have
to
do
anymore.”
so
that
is
the
law
of
kentucky.
