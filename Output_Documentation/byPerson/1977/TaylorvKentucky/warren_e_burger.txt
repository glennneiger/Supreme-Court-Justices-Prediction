chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
taylor
against
kentucky.
mr.
aprile,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
constitutional
issues
be
different
if
there
had
been
ten
witnesses
on
each
side?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
jurisdiction,
is
any
criminal
case
ever
tried
without
the
essence
if
not
the
exact
contents
of
the
indictment
communicated
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
jury
find
out
what
the
charge
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
mean
given,
but
someone
tell
us
the
jury
what
the
crime
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
more
important,
more
critical
in
the
situation
where
as
in
some
jurisdictions
the
indictment
goes
to
the
jury
room
with
the
jurors
along
with
other
pieces
of
paper
that
are
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
neither
the
courtâ€™s
opinion
nor
the
dissenting
opinion
makes
any
reference
to
the
federal
constitutional
claim,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
dissenting
opinion
judge
wilhart
says
i
believe
he
expresses
the
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
would
now
reject
the
old
line
of
cases
relied
upon
by
the
majority
and
the
understatement
for
that
is
the
kentucky
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
only
that
but
they
do
not
cite
too,
they
certainly
were
aware
of
estelle
v.
williams
and
other
cases
that
you
now
rely
on
but
not
any
reference
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shearer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
jury
has
settled
all
these
issues
so
the
only
issue
before
the
court
is
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
they
be
granting,
would
they
place
that
in
a
case
like
this
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
the
federal
constitutional
claim
was
not
preserved
in
the
trial
court,
that
would
be
one
of
the
basis
of
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
aprile
you
have
about
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
