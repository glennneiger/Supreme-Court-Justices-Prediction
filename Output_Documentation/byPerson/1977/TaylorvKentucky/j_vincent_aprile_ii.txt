mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
state
criminal
prosecution
in
which
the
petitioner
michael
taylor
was
convicted
of
the
offense
of
second
degree
robbery
in
violation
of
the
criminal
code
of
kentucky.
the
two
constitutional
issues
presented
in
this
case
are
first
whether
the
trial
judge
denied
petitioner
his
due
process
guarantee
under
the
federal
constitution
when
he
refused
to
instruct
on
the
presumption
of
the
innocence
when
he
was
requested
to
do
so
by
the
defense
attorney
and
secondly
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
denied
petitioner
due
process
under
the
federal
constitution
when
he
refused
to
give
the
requested
instruction
on
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
this
is
a
relatively
simple
criminal
prosecution.
the
state
presented
only
one
witness
to
prove
its
case.
that
was
mr.
james
maddox,
the
victim
of
the
alleged
robbery.
the
defense
presented
one
witness
the
petitioner
michael
taylor
testifying
in
his
own
behalf.
no
other
corroborative
evidence
was
presented
by
the
state
of
any
sort
physical
or
testimonial.
an
analysis
of
the
facts
that
this
case
reveals
that
the
at
the
inception
of
the
trial
during
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury,
the
defense
attorney
attempted
to
talk
to
the
jurors
concerning
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
the
prosecutor
referred
to
the
defense
attorney’s
comments
about
the
presumption
of
innocence,
but
did
not
speak
at
all
during
voir
dire
about
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
in
his
opening
statement,
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
he
would
but
one
witness,
the
alleged
robbery
victim
and
that
the
essence
of
the
commonwealth’s
evidence
would
include
the
fact
that
a
warrant
was
taken
against
michael
taylor
by
the
prosecuting
witness
and
that
the
grand
jury
had
returned
an
indictment
against
michael
taylor.
he
then
was
instructed
by
the
trial
judge
to
read
the
indictment
to
the
jury
which
he
did.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
necessarily
would
be,
but
i
believe
the
facts
of
this
case
make
it
a
prime
vehicle
for
focusing
on
the
impact
of
the
presumption
of
the
innocence.
in
this
case,
it
was
clearly
the
word
of
one
man
against
the
word
of
another
and
if
the
status
of
the
defendant
as
a
person
who
has
been
arrested,
indicted
and
arraigned
is
to
be
used
as
any
indicia
of
guilt
against
him,
this
could
be
the
crucial
factor
in
this
case
to
swing
the
jury
to
convict
this
man
in
a
very,
very
close
case
and
that
is
why
i
have
focused
on
the
facts
in
this
instance.
without
belaboring
the
facts,
i
would
also
like
to
point
to
the
fact
that
under
the
direct
examination
of
this
prosecution
witness,
the
prosecutor
elicited
from
him
that
he
had
indeed
reported
this
crime
immediately
to
the
police
that
he
had
obtained
a
warrant
against
the
petitioner
and
that
he
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
seeking
the
indictment
which
of
course
was
eventually
returned.
also
the
case
boiled
down
to
the
fact
that
the
defense
admitted
that
michael
taylor
knew
the
robbery
victim
that
he
had
been
to
his
apartment
on
three
or
so
occasions
and
he
adamantly
denied
that
he
had
participated
in
this
robbery
or
that
he
was
present
on
the
night
of
alleged
crime
february
16,
1976.
at
this
point
with
the
evidence
in
this
posture
the
parties
met
with
the
trial
judge
on
the
instructions.
at
that
time
the
trial
defense
attorney
requested
and
tendered
instructions
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
the
trial
judge
refused
to
give
those
instructions
and
gave
no
comparable
version
of
them.
instead
he
instructed
on
only
three
things.
one,
the
substantive
elements
of
the
offense
of
second
degree
robbery.
two,
he
told
the
jury
about
reasonable
doubt
and
gave
a
general
definition
of
reasonable
doubt
and
third,
he
instructed
them
that
their
verdict
must
be
unanimous
in
this
configuration
that
the
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no
your
honor,
the
indictment
did
not
go
to
the
jury
room,
but
it
was
read
in
toto
to
them
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
inception
of
the
trial.
at
that
point,
the
defense
attorney
still
trying
to
talk
to
the
jury,
talked
to
them
about
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
is
unique
i
suspect
with
regard
to
other
jurisdictions,
but
i
have
reviewed
many
transcript
of
records
in
which
indictment
is
never
given
to
the
jury
nor
read.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
normally,
the
prosecutor
gives
a
synopsis
of
the
charge
in
his
opening
statement
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
your
honor
that
it
is
not
an
attack
made
on
the
procedure
of
the
telling
the
jurors
about
the
content
of
the
indictment
or
reading
it
to
them
or
even
giving
it
to
them.
the
problem
seems
to
be
in
this
context
is
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
being
allowed
to
do
this
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
in
having
some
means
of
guaranteeing
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
not
overridden
by
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
jury
that
the
indictment
is
in
some
way
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
guilt.
in
this
posture
what
the
defense
attorney
attempted
to
do
was
what
is
done
in
very
many
jurisdictions
and
that
is
to
have
the
trial
judge
give
a
cautionary
instruction
that
the
indictment
could
not
be
considered
as
having
any
evidentiary
value
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
it
might
be
in
certain
cases,
but
i
will
say
in
this
case
there
was
not
one
exhibit
introduced.
this
jury
did
not
have
this
slightest
concept
of
what
an
exhibit
was.
all
the
evidence
they
heard
came
from
the
witness
stand
or
statements
were
made
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
so
they
would
have
no
way
really
to
differentiate
a
paper
exhibit,
a
documentary
exhibit
from
testimonial
evidence.
so
they
were
looking
at
what
had
they
had
heard
in
that
courtroom
and
they
had
heard
the
prosecutor
under
instruction
of
the
judge
read
them
in
complete
verbatim
form
the
indictment.
so
i
think
that
while
your
distinction
is
valid
and
certainly
comes
to
the
play
in
many
situations
such
as
some
of
the
cases
i
have
cited
in
the
brief,
it
is
not
really
crucial
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
interplay
that
we
have
in
this
particular
situation.
there
are
two
things
that
occur.
number
one,
the
trial
judge
never
tells
in
his
instruction
to
jury
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
innocent.
number
two,
he
does
not
give
them
an
instruction
that
the
indictment
lacks
evidentiary
value.
add
to
this,
the
fact
that
even
his
reasonable
doubt
instruction
that
he
gives
to
jury
does
not
deal
with
the
burden
of
persuasion.
nowhere
in
any
of
those
instructions
that
he
gave
does
he
ever
say
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
prosecution.
indeed,
his
instruction
begins
on
the
substantive
offense
with
a
statement
“you
will
find
the
defendant
guilty
under
this
instruction
if
and
only
if
you
believe
from
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
of
the
following.
when
he
goes
into
his
instruction
on
a
reasonable
doubt
he
says.
if
upon
the
whole
case
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
defendant’s
guilt,
you
will
find
him
not
guilty.
number
one,
no
statement
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
innocence
accorded
to
this
defendant.
number
two,
no
statement
that
the
prosecution
bears
the
burden
of
proof
proving
the
man
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
number
three,
this
prosecutor
did
two
things
that
coalesce
both
of
these
arguments
together.
number
one,
he
knew
that
the
indictment
had
been
read
to
the
jury
and
he
questioned
this
one
witness
that
he
had
whether
or
not
he
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
testified.
it
looks
to
be
on
the
face
of
it
that
what
it
was
an
attempt
to
bootstrap
that
one
witness’
identification.
in
other
words,
it
is
an
indirect
way
of
saying
did
you
testify
before
the
grand
jury,
yes
i
did.
did
they
bring
back
an
indictment?
yes
they
did.
the
grand
jury
believed
you.
that
was
another
reason
why
this
cautionary
instruction
was
so
important
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
estelle
v.
williams
to
guarantee
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
the
fundamental
fair
trial
guarantee,
you
will
look
with
close
judicial
scrutiny
and
practices
and
procedures
they
conflict
with
the
presumption
of
innocence.
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
refusal
to
give
the
instruction
on
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value
conflicted
with
the
defendant’s
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
presumption
of
innocence,
but
look
also
at
what
this
particular
prosecutor
did
in
this
case.
he
had
just
heard
prior
to
his
closing
argument,
the
trial
judge
refused
to
give
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence.
what
did
he
do?
one
of
the
very
first
things
he
said
in
his
closing
argument
was
the
defendant
like
every
other
defendant
who
has
ever
tried,
who
is
in
the
penitentiary
or
in
the
reformatory
today
has
the
presumption
of
innocence
until
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
just
a
presumption
in
his
behalf.
number
one,
he
equated
the
presumption
of
innocence
with
the
concept
of
the
people
who
had
been
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment.
number
two,
he
indicated
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
really
does
not
have
any
validity
in
a
criminal
trial
because
it
certainly
did
not
protect
to
all
those
people
who
are
presently
confined
in
the
penitentiaries
of
penal
institutions
of
kentucky
at
the
time
of
their
trial.
number
two,
he
misstated,
clearly
misstated
the
definition
of
reasonable
doubt
which
was
given
by
the
judge.
he
told
the
jurors
that
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case
was
a
big
doubt.
he
also
told
them,
here
he
is,
this
prosecutor
is
faced
with
absolutely
no
evidence,
but
the
complaining
witness.
what
did
he
say?
he
said
the
absence
of
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
equates
with
the
defendant’s
guilt.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
number
one,
in
all
candors
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief
that
number
one,
it
was
not
challenged
by
the
defense
attorney
in
trial,
but
under
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
boyd
v.
united
states
and
as
you
applied
them
in
cupp
v.
naugten
and
kibbe
vs.
henderson,
this
court
said
that
you
must
evaluate
all
of
the
instructions
and
i
submit
that
this
particular
instruction
while
it
may
not
be
constitutionally
bankrupt
on
the
issue
of
reasonable
doubt,
it
is
deficient
because
it
did
not
allot
the
jury
to
utilize
the
fact
that
reasonable
doubt
could
be
generated
for
the
want
of
or
lack
of
evidence.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
this
court
does
not
wish
to
evaluate
instructions
and
it
is
some
sort
of
isolation.
this
instruction,
while
i
am
not
assuming
arguendo
they
will
pass
constitutional
muster,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
still
standing
alone
is
so
deficient
that
it
does
not
guarantee
or
protect
this
man’s
right
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
that
his
guilt
be
proven
by
probative
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no
your
honor
and
i
am
not
trying
to
litigate
it
separately,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
take
the
kentucky
court’s
position
which
is
if
you
have
give
an
instruction
on
the
reasonable
doubt
standards,
you
do
not
have
to
give
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence.
that
was
their
position.
they
based
it
on
a
long
line
of
kentucky
cases
that
go
back
to
the
early
1900s,
maybe
older
than
that,
but
my
point
is
this
was
no
model
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt.
perhaps
it
is
constitutionally
bankrupt,
i
know
i
do
not
have
that
issue
before
you,
but
i
am
saying
that
it
certainly
was
not
a
model
of
clarity
and
it
certainly
did
not
give
that
jury
the
reason
to
believe
that
they
understood
how
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
worked.
number
one,
it
never
talked
to
the
burden
of
persuasion.
number
two,
it
never
dealt
with
a
crucial
factor
that
this
court
recognized
in
johnson
v.
louisiana
that
most
courts
recognize
that
reasonable
can
be
generated
just
as
much
from
the
absence
or
want
of
evidence
as
from
the
evidence
itself.
in
this
case,
that
was
the
crucial
point.
there
was
an
absence
of
evidence.
we
had
a
swearing
contest
in
this
case.
here
is
the
complaining
witness.
he
said
this
man
did
it.
here
is
the
defendant.
i
did
not
do
it.
i
was
not
even
there.
it
was
a
balancing
contest.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
only
want
you
to
accept
those
cases
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
because
your
honor,
i
think
it
clearly
demonstrates
the
problem
that
we
had
in
this
case.
if
you
want
me
to
reach
back
to
the
very
clear
abstract
principles
i
would
say
this.
i
think
the
dissenting
judge
summarized
the
problem
very
well
in
his
statement.
he
said
the
law
builds
in
a
presumption
of
innocence
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
but
of
what
good
is
it
to
the
defendant
if
the
jury
is
not
told
about
it.
now,
this
court
in
1895,
in
coffin
v.
united
states
clearly
said
that
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
is
not
sufficient
when
a
man
asked
for
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction.
the
language,
although
the
case
was
a
federal
prosecution,
was
in
the
terms
that
every
man
is
guaranteed
the
protection
of
the
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor
if
i
may
just
speak
to
that,
i
was
not
the
trial
attorney,
but
i
certainly
was
the
appellate
attorney
and
i
wrote
the
brief
in
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
argument
one
was
phrased,
“the
court
below
erred
to
obtain
substantial
prejudice,
denied
appellant
due
process
of
law
by
refusing
to
give
the
defense
requested
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence.
not
only
did
it
cite
coffin
v.
united
states.
it
cited
this
court’s
decision
in
estelle
v.
williams
and
predicated
it
on
the
fact
that
in
estelle
v.
williams,
you
said
that
presumption
of
innocence
although
not
articulated
in
the
united
states
constitution
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
due
process
guarantee
of
a
fair
trail.
now,
i
have
no
control
over
what
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
make
two
points.
number
one,
kentucky
courts
have
never
focused
on
the
statement
of
a
constitutional
principle
in
an
objection.
number
two,
the
attorney
general’s
office
in
this
case
has
never
challenged
that
this
is
a
constitutional
question
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding.
number
three,
neither
in
oral
argument
nor
in
any
of
the
pleadings
of
the
courts
have
they
said
that
we
did
not
have
a
preserved
constitutional
issue
here,
but
i
will
go
one
step
farther.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
my
point
is
that
at
ever
stage,
kentucky
has
allowed
this
to
be
litigated
as
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
understand
that
your
honor,
but
my
point
is
simply
this.
the
fact
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
was
requested
and
the
fact
that
the
lack
of
evidentiary
value
of
the
indictment
was
requested
allows
in
kentucky
the
appellate
counsel
to
argue
the
constitutional
ramifications
of
it,
but
i
would
not
rest
on
that
premise
alone.
i
will
go
to
the
language
in
the
appendix,
it
is
clear
that
with
leave
of
court
in
this
particular
case,
the
defense
attorney
after
his
instructions
were
rejected
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
dictated
his
reasons
into
the
record
as
to
why
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
those
instructions.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
this
would
be
at
page
50
and
51,
your
honor
and
he
points
out
there
that
this
presumption
of
innocence
alone
is
sufficient
to
acquit
the
defendant.
the
court
in
none
of
its
other
instructions
so
charges
the
jury
with
this
very
basic
and
fundamental
principle
of
judicial
fair
play.
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
give
this
instruction.
he
puts
it
in
terms
of
a
fundamental
principle
of
judicial
fair
play.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
as
i
recall
in
a
recent
case
this
court
decided,
diggin
v.
smith,
you
rejected
the
same
sort
of
argument
when
a
federal
district
court
judge
said
that
the
constitutional
issue
had
not
been
presented
to
the
state
appellate
court
and
you
looked
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
it
clearly
was
raised
in
the
appellate
court
by
the
language
and
the
precedent
cited.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
the
question
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
do
they
have
to
consider
it?
i
have
only
practiced
there
for
five
years
on
a
myriad
of
appellate
court
cases
before
both
of
the
appellate
courts
of
kentucky
and
i
have
never
seen
a
decision
in
which
they
have
refused
to
consider
a
properly
objected
too
trial
errors
constitutional
ramifications
even
though
a
constitutional
basis
was
not
set
forth
and
i
am
talking
about
federal
constitution.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
what
it
really
was
is
that
they
only
took
part
of
it
when
they
talked
in
terms
of
substantial
prejudice.
you
will
notice
that
they
did
talk
in
terms
of
due
process
with
regard
to
the
second.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
the
indictment
and
both
of
those
arguments
were
stated
the
exact
same
way.
if
they
were
going
to
differentiate,
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record
to
make
a
differentiation
between
one
being
decided
on
a
state
law
basis.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
understand
that
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
has
often
elected
not
to
address
in
my
pleadings
and
other
pleadings
of
the
state
public
defender’s
office,
the
constitutional
issue
presented.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
number
two
i
would
cite
you
to
two
cases.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
this
particular
argument
has
never
been
made
by
the
attorney
general.
it
has
never
been
made
in
an
oral
argument
by
the
appellate
courts
of
kentucky
and
the
point
i
would
say
is
even
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
law
of
kentucky,
i
will
cite
you
to
two
cases.
i
can
give
you
the
cites,
i
do
not
know
the
numbers.
futrell
v.
commonwealth
and
jackson
v.
commonwealth
stand
for
the
principles
in
kentucky
that
an
unobjected
to
denial
of
due
process
sufficient
of
an
aggravated
nature
will
be
reviewed
on
appeal
even
if
it
has
not
been
properly
preserved.
not
properly
preserved
in
constitutional
terms,
properly
preserved
at
all,
not
even
objected
to.
we
do
not
have
a
rigid
contemporaneous
objection
rule
like
florida
did.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
in
futrell
and
in
jackson,
they
were
dealing
with
federal
constitutional
rights
though
in
the
two
cases
where
those
statements
were
made.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
did
not
raise
any
due
process
issue
under
the
state
constitution
on
either
issue.
that
question
was
not
even
before
the
court.
i
did
not
ground
my
issues
in
either
case
on
anything
but
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
grave
disservice
to
criminal
litigants
in
the
appellate
process
if
state
appellate
courts
could
by
the
language
of
their
opinion
decline
to
reach
constitutional
issues
and
that
that
would
be
binding
upon
this
court.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
it
seems
that
if
we
are
moving
to
such
a
point
in
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
in
this
regard
is
he
put
this
in
terms
of
fundamental
due
process,
fundamental
judicial
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yet
the
state
appellate
court
did
mention
due
process
with
regard
to
the
indictment
issue,
the
instruction
on
the
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
doubt
that
in
this
particular
case
both
of
these
issues
were
addressed
on
a
constitutional
basis.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
what
you
had
there
was
a
hastily
constructed
language
in
the
opinion
in
which
one
instance
they
refer
to
one
aspect
which
was
the
due
process,
in
another,
they
refer
to
the
substantial
prejudice.
i
grounded
the
issue
on
substantial
prejudice
and
due
process
of
law,
kentucky
law
and
federal
constitutional
law
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
give
you
that
impression,
but
the
language
that
i
quoted
to
you
from
futrell
and
jackson
is
the
law
of
kentucky
that
because
an
issue
is
not
properly
preserved,
even
minimally
preserved
in
terms
of
an
objection
does
not
preclude
review
by
an
appellate
court
in
kentucky
if
it
is
an
aggravated
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think
the
question,
your
honor
can
best
be
seen
by
the
fact
that
if
upon
a
review
of
the
pleadings
that
i
know
are
part
of
the
record
that
is
before
this
court,
you
will
notice
that
the
attorney
general’s
office
waived
any
challenge
in
the
appellate
court
to
any
question
of
preservation
in
terms
of
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
part
of
the
appendix,
but
it
is
part
of
the
record
that
was
brought
up
from
the
state
court.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor
all
i
can
say
is
based
on
my
experience
in
kentucky
that
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
uses
a
term
due
process
could
just
as
easily
have
been
the
federal
constitution.
i
do
not
know
why
they
would
have
been
referring
to
due
process.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
it
is
also
the
antecedent
for
that
as
the
fact
that
in
argument
as
well
as
in
the
briefs
i
pointed
out
that
if
those
cases
still
existed
on
the
books,
they
were
no
longer
valid
in
terms
of
your
pronouncement
in
1976
in
estelle
v.
williams
that
made
the
presumption
of
innocence
part
and
parcel
of
the
due
process
course.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
my
claim
your
honor
was
presented
in
terms
of
federal
constitutional
issue.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
at
no
time,
your
honor
was
any
argument,
not
one
question
in
oral
argument
was
placed
to
me
on
this
basis.
not
one
time
has
anyone
until
this
moment
suggested
that
this
was
not
properly
preserved
and
the
state
courts
of
kentucky
did
not
do
that.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
their
preservation
--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
see
that
would
be
a
possible
remedy,
but
i
think
maybe
the
best
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
one
of
my
issues
that
i
did
not
take
before
this
court,
the
prosecutor’s
closing
argument,
there
is
a
lengthy
discussion
that
although
the
prosecutor’s
closing
argument
was
improper,
it
would
not
be
considered
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
properly
preserved.
here,
the
opinion
goes
to
great
lengths
to
say,
no
proper
preservation.
why?
because
the
attorney
general’s
office
argued
lack
of
proper
preservation.
in
this
case,
they
do
not
talk
about
this
constitutional
issue
is
not
clearly
before
us.
i
think
you
have
to
give
a
fair
reading
to
this
opinion
and
a
fair
reading
of
it
is
under
diggin
v.
smith
that
i
submitted
federal
constitutional
issues
to
that
court
and
you
have
to
interpret
to
conclude
that
they
did
not
reach
my
question
simply
because
they
do
no
make
reference
to
it
in
the
courts
opinion.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
go
outside
the
record,
but
as
i
say
for
over
five
years
i
practiced
in
the
appellate
courts
of
kentucky
and
it
is
not
unusual
for
them
to
dismiss
federal
constitutional
claims
without
reference
to
a
federal
constitutional
case.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
have
seen
it
done
on
innumerable
occasions,
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
are
quick
to
point
out
the
absence
of
proper
preservation.
i
do
not
know
how
much
time
that
i
have
exactly
left
but
i
would
like
to
reserve
just
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
would
just
like
to
of
course
take
issue
with
the
point
that
was
made
by
the
representative
of
the
commonwealth.
when
you
repose
the
brief
in
this
case
you
will
see
that
in
both
of
those
issues,
estelle
v.
williams,
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
was
all
set
forth
as
the
basis
for
the
due
process
denial
on
both
of
these
issues.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor
on
page
seven
of
the
brief
and
page
eight,
talked
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
fair
trials
of
fundamental
liberty
secured
the
presumption
of
essence
that
sort
of
thing,
it
went
on
to
say
that
in
this
context
this
denied
the
man
has
right
of
a
fair
trial.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
they
are
not
decided
in
constitutional
parameters
that
is
true,
yes
your
honor.
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
when
we
got
into
our
original
discussion
yes
sir.
also,
i
would
point
out
that
at
no
time
did
the
trial
court
or
the
appellant
court
in
this
case
challenged
the
giving
of
this
instruction
on
a
presumption
of
innocence
on
the
basis
that
it
was
defective
in
anyway.
the
voir
dire
argument
was
certainly
not
part
and
parcel
of
a
judicial
instruction
and
i
have
cited
many
cases
to
that
effect.
thank
your
honors.
