mr.
guy
c.
shearer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
getting
a
bit
aged
i
am
afraid
to
fight
fire
with
fire,
but
sometimes
you
found
yourself
in
such
a
position
that
you
have
no
other
out.
i
agree
with
mr.
aprile
that
this
is
a
balancing
contest
and
speaking
of
what
occurred
here.
mr.
maddox
the
victim
in
here
was
robbed
by
michael
taylor.
he
was
a
man
who
worked,
respected
51-year-old
man
at
whiskey
store,
very
diligent,
had
his
own
little
place
where
he
had
lived
for
16
years
in
the
job
that
he
had
occupied
for
17
years.
he
had
known
michael
taylor
for
15
years
and
michael
came
to
his
home
for
two
or
three
times
and
apparently
were
friends.
on
the
night
in
question
michael
brought
a
man
with
him.
he
went
to
the
door
and
told
him
they
wanted
to
come
in.
he
said,
“no,
you
cannot
come
in
because
i
want
to
go
to
bed
and
go
to
sleep”
and
he
had
a
friend
with
him.
he
locked
the
door
and
went
back
to
bed.
shortly
thereafter,
15
minutes
thereafter
he
returned
to
his
home
and
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
let
him
in
and
he
did
not
let
him
in,
but
he
did
unlock
the
door.
the
two
men
pushed
in
the
house,
pulled
him
out,
robbed
him,
took
his
money
$10.00
or
$15.00,
took
his
cards,
credit
cards
and
the
like,
and
then
the
man
ran
away.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
the
balancing
contest
was
the
only
reason
from
my
being
that
up
your
honor.
what
we
are
here
going
today
though
is
did
the
petitioner
michael
taylor
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
jury
instruction
of
presumption
and
of
innocence
tendered
by
his
counsel
as
a
separate
instruction.
the
instructions
which
were
tendered
here
by
counsel
speak
for
themselves.
in
his
instruction,
he
showed
that
he
said
the
man
was
slate
clean
or
clean
slate,
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
cracks
left
along.
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
man
was
not
slate
clean
or
clean
slate,
he
knew
it,
but
he
wanted
to
give
the
impression
probably
over
to
that
jury
adroitly
by
inflection
of
the
voice
convey
the
idea
at
a
later
time.
we
are
also
concerned
with
this
case
that
he
mentioned
here
in
the
matter
what
he
was
basing
it
on
--
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes
sir.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
i
do
not
understand.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes
sir,
it
was
not
correct
as
to
form
and
it
would
have
been
in
there
form
to
have
accepted
it.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
you
have
to
ask
this
counsel,
mr.
justice.
why
is
it
not?
well,
the
prosecutor
did
not
put
it
in
issue
because
it
did
reflect
on
his
integrity.
he
was
on
a
probated
sentence
for
knowingly
receiving
stolen
property,
one
year
since.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes,
i
agree
with
you
100%.
he
was
free
as
far
as
his
charge
was
concerned
until
evidence
why
it
is
introduced
against
him?
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
no,
yes,
but
here
is
the
point.
if
he
could
get
an
instruction
with
slate
cleaned
or
cleaned
slate
in
it
for
which
was
no
excuse
at
all
because
that
was
evidence.
he
used
it
as
a
peg
on
which
to
get
over
to
the
jury
in
his
argument
that
this
man
was
clean
slate
on
everything,
all
the
way
through,
it
is
of
no
trick,
it
is
as
common
as
days
gone
in
certain
jurisdiction.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
exactly
right
and
we
have
had
this
argument
along
this
very
thing
here
goes
back
to
king
darius
over
2,500
years
ago
and
that
too
did
not
have
any
specific
instruction
on
it.
they
said
it
took
two
or
three
witnessed
that
was
the
burden
approved
you
had
to
meet,
but
it
showed
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
followed
you
until
it
was
overcome
and
overwhelmed
by
evidence.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
no,
he
was
not
entitled
to
it
at
all
with
that
word
clean
slate
in
there.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
it
said
that
presumption
of
innocence
is
proved
until
he
is
proved
to
be
guilty.
it
would
have
been
all
right,
but
the
clean
slate
is
evidence
and
there
is
no
place
--
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
that
is
absolutely
the
law
of
kentucky.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
in
the
case
of
coffin
the
court
did
hold
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
was
evidence.
later
however
this
court
in
agnew
and
holt
said
that
it
was
not
evidence.
it
is
pure
argument
and
argument
has
no
place
in
the
instructions
script.
in
the
cases
of
holt
and
agnew,
it
was
recognized
that
the
first
time
to
this
court
that
it
was
not
proved
are
evidence.
then
if
it
was
not
evidence
are
proved
there
would
not
exist
any
need
for
the
judge
to
give
an
instruction
on
something
that
was
not
proved.
the
instruction
was
dovetailed
with
the
evidence
and
kentucky
law
is
that
the
instruction
should
dovetail
with
the
evidence.
if
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
not
evidence
then
you
can
dovetail
an
instruction
with
the
evidence.
the
state
has
our
own
justice
system.
justice
of
federal
court
has
its
district
system,
has
its
court
of
appeals
system,
its
own
rules
and
the
rules
of
this
court.
the
reason
some
things
were
not
mentioned
in
the
argument
before
the
counsel
was
it,
it
was
not
preserved
at
the
state
level.
it
could
have
been,
but
was
not
preserved
and
should
have
been
if
he
thought
there
was
something
detrimental
in
it
and
that
some
deduction
was
made
there
from
which
was
not
reasonable.
the
states
and
the
federal
government
follow
their
rules
and
in
this
case
i
notice
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
20
and
rule
23,
you
were
not
supposed
to
bring
things
up
for
the
first
time
here
and
that
there
were
some
brought
up
which
i
ignored.
we
did
not
answer
because
we
did
not
think
it
was
that
we
should
answer
them.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
no,
they
did
not.
do
you
mean
that
they
argued
that
this
was
within
the
constitution
frame
of
kentucky?
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
no,
no
sir.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
they
did
not.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
in
kentucky
after
the
court
gives
its
instruction,
they
will
read
them
and
accept
them
or
reject
them
and
you
can
take
exception
to
him
or
you
can
take
exception
to
them
or
you
can
tender
amended
form
as
to
the
court
derived
its
own
form,
but
it
is
not
the
court’s
duty
to
write
instructions
for
the
defendant.
that
is
the
duty
of
his
counsel.
counsel
in
this
case
had
no
doubt
looked
a
long
time
before
he
had
found
in
that
federal
form
book
the
one
that
contain
those
words
clean
slate
of
which
he
wanted
to
turn
into
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
a
hope
that
he
could
talk
to
jury
into
believing
in
this
man's
record
was
spotless.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes,
it
is
now.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
at
the
state
level
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
that
is
correct.
now,
in
the
coffin
case
which
was
mentioned
here,
the
court
as
i
said
held
it
was
evidence,
but
later
held
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
doctrine
of
reasonable
doubt
were
not
equivalent.
they
were
not
the
same.
i
think
the
court
was
correct
in
that
ruling,
but
the
error
and
that
was
written
i
believe
in
1895
when
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
but
it
was
concluded
that
the
burden
known
as
it
is
now
is
the
bowman
of
commonwealth
to
make
its
case
and
in
this
case
we
submit
that
that
was
done.
a
tendered
instruction
number
three,
tendered
instruction
number
four,
all
speak
for
themselves,
all
have
things
in
them
that
are
evidence
and
this
is
not
evidence
in
the
very
case
that
was
cited
by
the
defendant,
proves
that
were
in
there.
for
example
number
four
there,
the
law
presumes
the
defendant
to
be
innocent
of
a
crime.
that
is
all
right
it
could
stop
there,
thus,
the
defendant
although
accused
against
the
crime
was
clean
slate
that
is,
he
does
not
say
if
no
proof
or
heard
and
be
entitled
in
an
acquittal
or
dismissal.
they
have
to
put
this
all
this
other
in
there
and
he
ends
up
saying
so
that
presumption
of
innocence
alone
is
sufficient
to
equip
the
defendant
so
lack
of
proof
alone
that
is
sufficient
and
as
far
as
the
indictment
goes
in
take
it
in
reading
it
is
a
common
practice
in
commonwealth
for
the
defense
to
get
up
and
take
the
paper
and
say
this
is
a
piece
of
paper.
he
has
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
little
indictment
on.
this
piece
of
paper
is
worth
just
as
much
as
that
until
they
put
proof
on
which
might
substantiate
what
is
on
that
one.
those
arguments
are
all
are
used
and
as
far
as
presumption
of
innocence
goes,
i
want
to
say
this
to
this
court,
i
have
practiced
law
41
years.
the
great
book
of
which
was
a
defense
attorney
and
i
have
yet
in
the
commonwealth
to
hear
a
crowd
start
out
in
which
the
thing
they
get
first
is
the
individual's
name
as
was
done
in
this
case.
the
second
thing
they
get
are
you
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
this
man
must
be
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
has
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
that
point
is
reached
and
then
whenever
they
say
yes,
every
single
juror
in
this
case,
every
one
of
them
was
asking.
they
went
back
to
have
a
discussion
on
it
in
chambers.
it
was
argued
all
on
that
side
and
if
you
are
good
counsel
is
with
getting
that
in
front
of
the
jury
and
one
of
the
favorites
that
we
would
use
down
our
way
we
would
say,
“look
this
is
a
presumption
of
innocence
and
you
talk
you
can
mention
and
say
this
was
brought
up
in
voir
dire
and
a
man
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
proven
guilty
as
stated
by
the
instructions
in
this
court
and
then
they
will
turn
to
the
judge
and
say
now
your
honor
if
i
have
misstated
it
please
inform
me
wherein
i
have
erred
and
you
have
got
it
in
front
of
the
jury
far
more
and
if
the
judge
will
either
confirm
it
or
deny.
mr.
guy
c.
shearer
yes,
sir
it
certainly
does.
and
if
some
quotations
that
would
appear
is
there
and
it
shows
that
it
went
at
great
length
into
it.
the
other
thing
that
was
brought
out
about
this
slate
clean
was
that
they
were
trying
to
make
this
man
who
worked
on
a
liquor
store
probably
knowing
that
some
people
were
prejudiced
against
him
for
drives
appear
that
he
was
not
comparable
with
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
and
who
was
in
there
using
employing
this
vehicle
for
trying
to
gather
an
acquittal.
the
last
thing
he
has
here
in
his
second
question
is
that
of
having
an
instruction
as
to
the
lack
of
value
of
an
indictment
that
it
is
not
evidence
where
a
clean
slate
was
that
it
is
not
evidence
the
court
has
those
case
are
all
federal
cases,
we
do
not
argue
with
them,
but
those
are
cases
where
they
took
mr.
chief
justice,
the
indictment
back
into
the
jury
room
and
where
they
could
place
embankment
down
and
read
it
and
reread
it
and
these
federal
courts
have
held
and
very
properly
so
that
if
you
are
going
to
do
that
then
an
instruction
is
going
to
cockney
to
let
that
jury
know
that
is
not
evidence
and
that
should
be
the
law
and
no
where
in
those
cases
is
there
any
consideration
given
to
the
instruction
that
the
indictment
lacks
evidentiary
value
in
kentucky
or
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right.
yet
counsel
for
the
petitioner
continues
to
contend
that
because
of
decided
cases
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
indictment’s
lack
of
evidentiary
value.
the
burden
of
proving
that
such
an
instruction
is
a
constitutional
right
is
not
upon
the
commonwealth,
but
it
is
upon
the
petitioner
alleging
and
this
burden
the
defendant
has
not
met.
some
total
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
can
leave
little
doubt
that
there
was
nothing
more
imbued
than
the
minds
of
those
12
jurors
than
the
doctrine
of
the
presumption
that
a
man
is
presumed
to
be
guilty
until
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
instruction
gave
him,
given
by
the
judge
and
that
judge
has
labored
so
hard
to
practice
and
record
speak
for
it
to
be
surely
guided.
let
him
make
a
statement
now,
let
him
come
back
after
the
argument,
after
the
court
and
put
other
statements
on
the
record
and
i
do
not
know
what
more
he
could
have
done.
you
could
not
expect
him
to
abdicate
his
right
to
prepare
instructions
over
to
defense
counsel.
i
never
could
get
him
to
do
it
so
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
entire
picture
as
i
see
it
and
it
looks
like
my
time
is
about
up
and
i
do
not
want
to
run
over
my
friend
mr.
aprile
did,
but
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
case
to
kentucky.
the
ruling
in
kentucky
leaves
more
leeway,
wider
space,
and
a
presumption
of
innocence
is
just
one
thread
in
the
fabric
and
it
is
much
better
for
when
advocacy
points
of
view
you
got
more
room
to
roam
than
you
do
in
many
of
the
other
states.
