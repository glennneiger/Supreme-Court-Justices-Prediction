justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now
last
case
i
have
is
a
criminal
case,
entirely
different
in
subject
matter.
in
this
case,
77-5549,
taylor
against
kentucky,
petitioner
was
convicted
a
robbery
in
a
kentucky
state
court,
in
a
case
in
which
there
were
only
two
witnesses,
the
alleged
victim
and
the
petitioner.
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
statement
read
the
indictment
to
the
jury
and
in
his
closing
statement
emphasized
petitioner's
status
as
a
defendant,
giving
rise
according
to
his
argument
to
inferences
of
guilt.
petitioner
later
sought
an
instruction
to
the
--
instruction
to
the
jury
that
the
indictment
was
not
evidence
of
his
guilt.
he
also
requested
an
instruction
that
he
was
presumed
to
be
innocent.
the
court
refused
to
give
either
of
these
instructions.
it
did,
however,
correctly
instruct,
though
briefly,
on
the
burden
of
proof.
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment.
appellate
courts
in
kentucky
sustained
the
conviction.
to
assure
a
verdict
based
solely
on
evidence
and
not
on
one
status
of
the
diffident,
the
presumption
of
innocence
should
be
emphasized
in
instructions
to
the
jury.
although
no
particular
form
of
wedge
is
necessary
to
assure
jury
understanding,
we
conclude
in
this
case,
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filled
today
with
clerk,
that
petitioner
was
not
given
a
fair
trial.
accordingly
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filled
a
concurring
statement.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined.
