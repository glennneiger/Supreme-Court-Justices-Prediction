justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
in
constitutional
terms,
mr.
aprile
and
that
leads
me
to
ask
you
a
question
that
has
troubled
me
from
the
time
i
read
the
briefs
in
this
case.
i
was
unable
to
find
that
what
you
say
as
the
first
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
to
due
process
of
law
by
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
give
it
instruction
under
the
presumption
of
innocence
when
petitioner’s
counsel
requested
and
intended
such
an
instruction.
i
was
unable
to
find
that
that
issue
was
ever
raised
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
appellate
courts
of
kentucky.
i
have
looked
at
the
requested
instruction
of
that
transcript.
i
do
not
find
that
that
was
ever
asserted
as
a
constitutional
claim.
i
looked
at
the
opinion
of
judge
howard
for
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
and
i
find
that
he
says
that
in
answer
to
the
contention,
the
well
established
law
of
kentucky
has
been
that
as
long
as
the
trial
court
instructs
the
jury
on
reasonable
doubt,
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
not
necessary.
well,
that
would
be
no
answer
whatsoever
to
a
constitutional
claim
and
yet
it
seems
to
be
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
the
complete
answer
to
whatever
defense
counsel’s
claim
was.
i
do
not
find
any
evidence
except
it
mentioned
once
in
judge
wilhoyt’s
dissenting
opinion
of
the
phrase
due
process
that
this
was
ever
tendered
as
a
constitutional
issue
to
the
kentucky
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
the
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
could
not
possibly
have
been
talking
about
the
federal
issue
when
they
talked
in
terms
of
the
established
law
of
kentucky,
that
is
no
answer
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
addressing
itself
whatsoever
to
any
sort
of
a
federal
constitutional
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
procedures,
is
that
sufficient
ground
for
the
kentucky
appellate
court
to
disregard
the
claim
under
kentucky
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
the
general
rule
of
many
states.
that
if
a
litigant
does
not
raise
something
in
the
trial
court
then
the
appellate
court
is
not
required
to
consider
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
even
with
respect
to
your
second
point,
that
is
referenced
to
due
process
of
law,
could
be
referring
to
the
state
constitution,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
mention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
throughout
this
opinion
or
the
dissenting
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court.
the
court
has
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
consider
whatever
claims
counsel
has
to
make
and
if
he
does
not
make
them,
then
he
has
waived
them
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
moving
to
such
a
point.
that
is
the
established
law.
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
not
mention
due
process
in
the
trial
court.
state
or
federal
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
is
a
very
usual
rule
in
appellate
courts,
however,
that
at
least
the
court
need
not
deal
with
questions
that
were
not
properly
presented
in
the
trial
court.
now,
is
that
the
law
of
kentucky
or
is
it
your
submission
that
appellate
courts
in
kentucky
will
always
consider
a
constitutional
issue
even
though
it
is
raised
there
for
the
first
time?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
same
case,
we
ought
to
send
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
and
ask
them
as
we
have
done
in
krigder
(ph)
v.
california,
did
you
decide
this
federal
constitutional
question
or
did
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
for
them
to
answer
a
federal
constitutional
claim
by
saying
it
is
well-established
state
law.
that
just
poses
the
question,
that
does
not
answer
it.
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
your
brother
these
were
not
brought
up
for
the
first
time
here,
but
were
brought
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
in
its
brief,
its
constitutional
arguments.
do
you
agree
with
that
sir?
did
they
make
their
constitutional
claims
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
they
argued
that
kentucky
law
was
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
they
did
not
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
it
is
a
federal
constitutional
claim,
it
has
discretion
to
deny
it,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
