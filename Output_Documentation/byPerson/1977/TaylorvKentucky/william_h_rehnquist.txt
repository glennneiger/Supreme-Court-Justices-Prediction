justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
challenging
the
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court
on
the
question
of
reasonable
doubt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
not
bankrupt
as
you
say
and
not
constitutionally
deficient,
what
business
does
this
court
have
addressing
itself
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
kentucky
appellate
court
and
your
petition
for
certiorari
do
not
raise
that
as
a
separate
point,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
kentucky
constitution
have
a
due
process
clause
in
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
response
suggests
that
if
they
mentioned
due
process
in
treating
the
evidentiary
value
of
the
indictment,
but
not
with
respect
to
your
other
issues
that
perhaps
if
your
are
right
that
they
used
due
process
in
the
federal
sense,
they
felt
they
were
treating
a
federal
question
in
one
instance,
but
not
in
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
the
question
would
be
whether
in
fact
the
kentucky
appellate
court
had
passed
on
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shearer,
am
i
right
in
thinking
now
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
is
an
intermediate
appellant
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
highest
court
is
now
called
the
supreme
court
and
i
notice
at
page
59
of
the
record,
there
is
an
order
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
denying
what
is
the
denominated
discretionary
review.
does
the
supreme
court
have
absolute
discretion
to
deny
a
petition
on
whatever
the
grounds
of
the
petition
for
it
is?
