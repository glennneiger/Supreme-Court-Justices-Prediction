unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
any
control
but
unless
it
is
raised
at
the
first
opportunity
to
raise
it
which
in
this
case
was
in
the
trial
court,
then
it
is
not
before
us?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
matter
of
our
jurisdiction,
we
decide
that.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
their
sole
answer
as
a
matter
this
is
the
established
kentucky
law
and
of
course
that
would
be
no
answer
whatsoever
to
a
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
is,
it
not,
in
some
cases
it
is
and
in
some
cases
it
is
not
and
i
am
asking,
i
am
not
arguing
where
if
at
all
was
it
raised
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
have
to
consider
it?
unknown
speaker
they
did
consider
it
but
did
it
have
to.
you
are
stuck
with
that
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
not
talk
about
your
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
obviously
did
not
consider
your
claim
because
it
simply
relied
on
the
line
of
kentucky
cases.
i
am
looking
at
page
55
of
the
appendix.
the
well
established
law
of
kentucky
has
been
that
as
long
as
the
trial
court
instructs
the
jury
on
reasonable
doubt,
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
not
necessary.
now,
that
would
be
no
answer
whatsoever
to
your
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
obviously,
it
was
not
considered.
unknown
speaker
you
talked
about
one
witness
in
this
case
recalls
to
my
mind
the
range
of
latin
legal
maxim
two
that
witnesses
are
weighed
not
counted
and
the
weight
in
this
case
was
what
they
were
trying
to
circumvent
through
tendering
an
instruction
that
could
have
been
a
good
instruction
if
it
would
have
just
not
that
two
or
three
words
in
it
and
in
the
rewrite
the
instruction
previously
given
by
the
court.
unknown
speaker
is
the
record
of
the
voir
dire
here
in
this
case
in
the
record?
does
the
transcript
of
the
voir
dire
appear
in
the
record
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
relied
greatly,
i
have
just
glanced
through
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky,
you
were
lying
greatly
on
these
three
federal
case,
coffin,
holt,
and
one
of
218
u.s.
245
none
of
which
was
a
constitutional
case?
unknown
speaker
you
do
talk
about
it.
i
simply
pointed
out
that
would
you
agree
that
these
three
federal
cases
are
not
constitutional
cases?
