justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
question
here
is
whether
a
corporate
officer's
liability
to
the
government
for
taxes
with
help
from
corporate
employees
is
dischargable
in
bankruptcy.
the
internal
revenue
service
filed
a
bankruptcy
claim
for
taxes
that
respondent
had
collected
from
his
corporation's
employees,
but
had
not
paid
over
to
the
government.
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that,
respondent
was
liable
for
these
taxes
under
the
internal
revenue
code
and
that
this
liability
was
made
non-dischargeable
by
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
district
court
affirmed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
did
so
largely
on
the
ground
that
respondent's
liability
is
termed
a
penalty
by
the
internal
revenue
code
whereas
the
bankruptcy
act's
non-dischargeability
provision
refers
to
taxes.
by
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
the
penalty
language
of
the
court
is
not
dispositive
because
of
funds
were
unquestionably
taxes
when
collected
from
the
employees.
congress
was
particularly
concerned
about
situations
in
which
corporations
and
their
officer's
would
be
relieved
the
liability
in
bankruptcy,
while
unincorporated
small
businessman
will
remain
liable
for
the
same
type
of
debt.
thus
both
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
support
our
holding
that
respondent's
liability
is
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
probably
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined.
