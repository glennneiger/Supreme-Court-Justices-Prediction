justice
thurgood
marshall
coming
back
to
this
gigantic
fraud
and
all
you
are
talking
about,
how
much
of
that
is
involved
in
the
litigation
now
pending
in
the
new
york
state
torts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
told
by
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
not
help
me
at
all
because
i
do
not
know
a
thing
from
here.
we
started
off
with
“we
are
informed”
and
we
ended
up
with
“we
are
informed.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
an
affidavit
which
said
positively
that
bankers
trust
said
that
this
was
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
pitt,
bankers
trust
on
the
paragraph
on
page
110,
do
you
have
anything
more
than
that
to
show
its
implication
or
are
you
also
relying
on
this
one
paragraph
about
the
informants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
trying
to
get
is
that
this
is
all
you
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
told
in
pleading,
when
you
plead
something
like
fraud
you
would
be
as
specific
as
you
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
is
i
stick
to
my
teaching
and
you
have
left
yours.
