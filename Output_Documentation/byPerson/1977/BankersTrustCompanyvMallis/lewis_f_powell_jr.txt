justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
your
position
not
simply
that
there
would
be
no
sale
under
this
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
warden,
what
about
the
phrase
“in
connection
with”?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
now
included?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
hauser,
this
sale
you
are
describing
now
is
a
sale
from
kates.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
from
bankers
trust?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
pitt,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
that
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference
to
your
position
whether
there
ever
had
been
a
pledge
to
bankers
on
a
release
by
bankers.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
bankers
trust
could
have
held
the
securities
in
safekeeping,
not
having
ever
received
them
under
a
pledge.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there
has
to
be
a
sale.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
pledge
by
arnold
to
mallis
and
kupferman
was
a
sale
under
your
theory.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
entirely?
i
have
interrupted
you.
how
long
has
the
sec
taken
the
position
you
take
here
today
that
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
issued
any
release
as
to
that
effect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
either
the
act
of
’33
or
’34
that
supports
your
position
that
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
hearings
that
led
up
to
those
acts
were
very
extensive
and
they
dealt
with
all
sorts
of
problems
relating
to
securities.
i
would
be
curious,
i
would
have
thought,
not
to
have
gotten
into
the
business
of
lending
money
and
putting
up
a
collateral
if
congress
had
intended
to
deal
with
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
pitt,
in
that
connection,
this
transaction
is
quite
extraordinary.
it
is
very
rare
that
private
individuals
lend
this
sort
of
money.
the
securities
acts
were
concerned
primarily,
i
had
thought,
were
protecting
unsophisticated
investors.
here,
we
are
dealing
primarily
with
banks
and
lending
institutions
by
definition,
sophisticated
investors.
the
acts
certainly
were
not
designed
primarily
to
protect
them.
i
suppose
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
foreclosed
and
if
the
securities
have
not
been
registered,
they
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
’33.
