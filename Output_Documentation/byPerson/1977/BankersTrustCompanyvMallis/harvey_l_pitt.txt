mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
a
pledge
being
a
sale
is
correct.
we
take
no
position
on
whether
the
release
of
the
stock
with
respect
to
a
natural
fulfillment
of
the
pledge
agreement
is
a
sale
for
purposes
of
the
act
and,
as
the
petitioners
themselves
argue,
that
was
irrelevant.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
think
that
the
opinion
stands
analytically
without
that
holding.
it
may
well
be
that
some
of
the
judges
on
the
second
circuit
were
concerned
about
finding
a
completed
transaction,
a
sale
and
a
purchase,
but
i
think,
as
our
brief
attempts
to
demonstrate,
analytically
there
was
a
sale
with
respect
to
the
pledge
transaction.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
also
say,
at
this
juncture,
that
our
concern
is
not
with
the
release
of
the
securities
after
a
pledge
transaction
although
there
is
a
conceivable
possibility
that
in
some
circumstances
fraud
may
be
induced
in
the
holder
of
the
collateral
and
that
might
be
actionable.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
we
have
gotten
away
from
privity
and
mr.
rehnquist’s
decision
in
blue
chip
stamps
case
this
court
specifically
referred
to
the
fact
that
10b5
has
gone
light
years
away.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
i
may,
your
honor,
not
the
release,
the
sale
occurred
when
arnold
and
fowler
pledged
their
stock
to
mallis
and
kupferman
and
bankers
trust
affirmatively
made
a
misrepresentation
to
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct
and
that
is
all
this
court
need
to
focus
on,
except
in
so
far
as
it
may
be
concerned
about
the
motivation
of
bankers
trust
as
is
alleged
in
the
pleadings
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
definitely
not.
we
are
talking
solely
about
the
pledge
from
arnold
and
fowler
to
mallis
that
was
induced
by
bankers
trust’s
affirmative
misrepresentation
as
alleged
in
the
papers
in
this
court
proceeding.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
pardon?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
what
the
second
circuit
was
holding
with
respect
to
that
side
of
the
transaction.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
the
pledge.
the
second
circuit
also
felt
it
appropriate.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
but,
analytically,
once
bankers
trust
was
satisfied
as
to
the
legal
terms
of
its
contract
with
kates.
it
is
arguable
that
that
release
should
not
be
deemed
a
sale.
that
is
not
of
concern
in
this
case
and
that
is
not
an
issue
we
think
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
i
have
given
the
impression
that
there
is
yet
a
third
theory
then
i
must
apologize.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
believe
that
the
theory
that
we
have
espoused
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
second
circuit’s
decision.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
analytically,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
decision
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
would
like
to
explain
why
if
i
may.
the
fraud
occurred
in
connection
with
a
misrepresentation
made
to
mallis
to
pay
over
funds
sufficient
to
accomplish
the
purchase
and
upon
which
he
was
induced
to
rely
on
the
investment
value
of
the
securities
that
served
as
collateral
for
the
loan
transaction.
if
there
was
fraud,
as
this
court
must
assume
based
on
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
then
mallis
and
kupferman
in
taking
the
stock
were
defrauded
based
on
the
investment
value
of
that
stock.
it
matters
not
that
prior
to
that
transaction,
bankers
trust
released
the
stock
to
kates
so
that
kates
could
give
it
to
arnold
and
fowler.
that
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
fraud
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
are
relying
on
110
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
on
110
as
to
the
affirmative
misrepresentations,
yes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
what
else?
we
are
relying
solely
on
the
fact
that,
as
a
motion
to
dismiss,
this
could
be
pleaded
on
information
and
belief.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
this
is
all,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
procedures,
what
occurred
here
was
that
judge
pollack
instituted
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
his
own
suggestion
and,
in
connection
with
that,
refused
to
allow
an
amendment
of
the
complaint.
however,
in
his
decision
dismissing
the
complaint,
which
is
what
he
did,
he
indicated
that
he
would
deem
the
complaint
most
favorably
alleged
under
section
10b
and
rule
10b5.
he
effectively
extrapolated
all
of
the
materials
that
are
before
this
court
and
deemed
it
to
be
an
amendment
and
still
dismissed
it.
but,
he
denied
formal
leave
to
amend
the
complaint.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
except
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
am
sorry.
except
the
dismissal
of
the
action.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
although
i
think
when
this
case
was
tried
one
of
the
allegations
that
the
plaintiffs
appeared
to
be
making
is
that
bankers
realizing
it
had
a
defective
set
of
securities
as
collateral
was
anxious
and
deliberately
misrepresented
the
value
of
that
stock
so
that
it
could
get
out
of
its
bad
transaction.
in
that
sense,
i
think
it
might
be
relevant.
but
of
course
that
is
speculation
at
this
juncture.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
been
hearing
to
some
extent,
i
must
say,
respectfully
from
my
brothers.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
precisely
our
position.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
analytically,
that
would
not
affect
the
allegation
of
fraud
in
this
case.
i
quite
agree.
indeed
if
i
may
assert
what
we
think
the
issue
is,
we
would
assert
that
when
a
person
is
deceived
into
parting
with
money
in
exchange
for
an
interest
in
securities,
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
situation
to
which
the
federal
securities
laws
anti-fraud
protection
were
intended
to
apply.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
must
be
a
disposition
of
an
interest
which
is
a
sale.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
it
was.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
have
taken
that
position
since
the
late
1950s.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
we
have
filed
a
number
of
lawsuits.
we
have
a
number
of
cases
which
are
set
forth
in
our
amicus
brief
before
this
court.
we
have
articulated
that
in
certain
cases.
we
have
exempted
pledge
transactions
where
they
would
otherwise
be
included
within
the
definition
of
a
sale.
indeed,
the
petitioners
take
comfort
surprisingly
to
us
from
our
rule
16a6
in
which
we
specifically
felt
the
need
to
exempt
a
pledge
from
the
operative
term
“sale”
for
the
purposes
of
that
rule
so
as
not
to
encompass
those
pledges
in
that
special
limited
circumstance.
but,
otherwise,
we
have
taken
this
position
consistently
since
the
1950s.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
there
is
something
specific
on
pledges,
i
must
confess,
i
am
unaware
of
that.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
i
had
occasion
before
coming
here
today
to
review
our
amicus
brief
and
the
superintendent
of
insurance
case
where
this
court
expressly
held
that
not
only
shareholders
but
creditors
were
specifically
within
the
intendment
of
the
securities
exchange
act
protections
for
anti-fraud.
in
our
brief,
we
did
cite
legislative
history
which
was
rather
defused.
i
cannot
tell
you
that
there
were
expressed
references
to
pledged
transactions.
but,
it
talked
about
the
value
of
the
securities
held
by
banks,
the
value
of
securities
held
by
insurance
companies,
the
massive
loans
that
were
utilized.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
section
2
of
the
securities
exchange
act
talks
about
making
and
preserving
the
investment
decision
of
investors
reasonably
complete
and
effective
from
anti-fraud
provisions.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
securities
exchange
act
covers
any
situation
in
which
there
is
an
investment
tent
and
an
investment
interest.
i
think
it
would
be
anomalous
to
suggest
that
when
someone
puts
up
$156,000
largely
in
reliance
on
the
underlying
value
of
securities
and
then
takes
the
possession
of
those
securities
that
that
does
not
constitute
an
investment
decision
that
this
court,
in
national
securities,
talked
about
in
terms
of
the
definition
of
sale
and,
in
blue
chip,
talked
about
in
terms
of
the
limited
coverage
of
some
of
the
exemptions
this
court
has
applied
more
recently.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
i
may,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
of
course,
i
guess
this
case
is
ample
evidence
of
the
fact
that
not
only
sophisticated
investors
find
themselves
in
this
position.
but,
more
importantly,
i
think
this
question
and
your
prior
question
focus
on
what
the
legitimate
concern
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is.
that
concern
deals
with
the
fact
that
when
securities
are
pledged,
the
next
step
is
that
those
pledged
securities
can
be
foreclosed
upon.
they
become
distributed
in
the
marketplace.
the
enforcement
actions
we
referred
to
have
shown
that
organized
crime
and
many
individuals
are
using
pledge
transactions
as
a
means
to
circumvent
our
rules.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
some
of
the
cases
we
have
had
have
had
knowing
schemes
in
that
direction.
banks
may
be
participants
and
not
just
victims.
in
addition,
i
think
it
fair
to
point
out
that
although
the
banks
this
court
has
been
faced
with
today
assert
that
they
would
not
like
the
protections
of
this
act,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
banks
themselves
have
sought
the
protections
of
section
10b
and
rule
10b5
in
these
kinds
of
situations.
there
are
smaller
banks
and
there
are
larger
banks
but
many
of
them,
including
the
exchange
national
bank
in
a
billion-dollar
transaction
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
friendly
recently,
where
the
protections
of
section
10b
and
rule
10b5
were
eagerly
sought
out
by
banking
institutions.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
in
this
particular
situation,
i
agree
with
justice
powell
that
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation
where
the
bank
is
alleged
to
have
made
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
i
grant
you
the
record
is
weak,
and
i
grant
you
the
fact
that
on
trial,
this
case
may
not
prove
out
at
all.
that
is
not
our
concern
at
this
juncture.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
was
taught
the
same
thing,
your
honor,
and
i
wish
this
complaint
had
been
more
specific
but
i
would
hope.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
are
to
make
a
statutory
determination
that
can
have
far-reaching
ramifications,
not
only
for
private
litigants
but
for
the
government,
the
commission
in
civil
enforcement
actions
and
the
justice
department
in
criminal
actions
that,
hopefully,
some
poor
pleading,
if
that
in
fact
is
the
case
here,
will
not
upset
an
important
statutory
protection
that
we
think
needs
--
.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no.
if
i
said
that,
i
apologize.
i
thought
i
was
asked
whether
there
were
specific
references
as
to
pledge
transactions
in
the
legislative
history.
as
to
a
specific
reference
to
pledge
transactions,
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
as
to
loan
and
credit
agreements
and
the
importance
of
providing
the
protections
of
the
securities
laws
in
this
context,
i
think
there
is
ample
legislative
history.
some
of
it
is
cited
in
our
superintendent
of
insurance
amicus
brief
before
this
court.
i
think
this
court’s
decision
in
superintendent
of
insurance
amply
supports
that
conclusion,
particularly
footnote
8
on
page
12
of
the
reported
decision.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
consistently
with
one
minor
exception
since
we
commenced
raising
this
issue
which
was
started
in
late
1950s.
in
the
late
1950s,
the
second,
fifth,
seventh,
and
tenth
circuits
have
all
acknowledged
that
pledges
are
sales.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
under
the
both
acts.
in
one
case,
i
believe,
the
fifth
circuit
had
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
a
limitation
as
to
when
a
pledge
could
be
a
sale.
but,
it
is
my
understanding
that
these
circuits
have
held
that,
at
least
as
to
the
’33
act,
and
i
am
not
a
sure
but
i
think
in
one
case
as
to
the
’34
act
the
downum
case
that
we
cite
in
which
we
alleged
the
10b5
violation
that
under
the
’34
act
as
well.
if
i
may,
in
that
respect,
this
court
has
said
in
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
national
securities
as
well
as
in
the
hawk
felder
decision
that
the
interpretation
of
the
’33
and
’34
act
should
be
construed
in
para
materia
because
they
were
both
complimenting
ends
toward
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
of
the
nation’s
securities
trading
activities.
