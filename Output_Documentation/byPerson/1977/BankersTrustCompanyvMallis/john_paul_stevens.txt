justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
weiner,
that
particular
sale
you
would
concede
as
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
sale
between
kates
to
arnold
and
fowler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
the
pledges
were
not
in
connection
with
that
sale
or
the
release
of
the
pledge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
weiner,
would
it
make
any
difference
if
the
bank
had
introduced
the
parties
or
known
all
these
details?
would
that
have
any
relevance
to
the
legal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
do
we
dwell
on
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
go
to
whether
or
not
“in
connection
with”
the
fraud,
is
that
not
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
not,
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
have
to
assume
that
bankers
life
committed
some
kind
of
a
fraud
but
it
is
not
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
this
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
use
the
word
“pledge,”
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
pretty
hard
to
do
so,
would
it
not
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
pretty
hard
not
to
say
a
pledge
is
a
disposition
of
an
interest
in
the
securities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
statutory
definition
of
sale,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
warden,
is
that
quite
correct?
i
understood
mr.
weiner
to
agree
that
we
must
assume
that
the
bank
is
charged
with
a
fraud
here
and
we
have
to
accept
that
for
the
case.
that
is
something
more
than
making
a
conference
room
available,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
no
fraud
we
do
not
have
objectify
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
alleged
and
do
we
not
have
to
assume
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
decision
it
may
not
be
proved
ultimately
that,
at
the
closing,
bankers
trust
made
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation?
we
have
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
different
than
just
making
a
conference
room
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
warden,
it
may
be
a
very
weak
case
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
legal
question
we
are
supposed
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
that
they
made
a
representation
or
is
it
just
alleged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
affidavit
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
include
a
representation
about
the
bankers
trust
representation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
affidavit,
that
was
before
judge
pollack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
was
before
judge
pollack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
it
say?
what
are
you
referring
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
claim
that
the
release
of
the
pledge
was
a
sale
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
say
bankers
trust
was
a
seller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
thought
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
do
you
think
they
thought
that
holding
was
essential
to
their
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
release
was
in
connection
with
the
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
necessary
that
for
you
to
claim,
and
for
us
to
agree
with
you,
that
a
pledge
is
a
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
say
there
was
a
sale
that
took
place
here
and
then
this
release
was
in
connection
with
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
view
the
question
whether
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
a
pledge
a
sale
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
necessarily
defend
that
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
protect
the
new
pledgee
or
not?
could
the
new
pledgee
recover
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know.
but
they
are
not
the
buyers.
you
said
that
you
do
not
need
to
hold
that
they
are
buyers
at
all.
let
us
assume
that
they
are
not
buyers,
that
a
pledge
is
not
a
sale
or
a
purchase.
the
new
pledgee
is
not
a
buyer
and
he
did
not
get
the
stock
from
a
seller.
bankers
is
not
a
seller
either,
but
it
makes
a
misrepresentation
connection
with
a
sale.
the
new
pledgee
can
recover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
certainly
is
not
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
need
to
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
then
there
is
very
little
chance
that
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether
a
release
is
a
sale,
there
is
very
little
chance
that
if
we
remanded
it
to
them
they
would
come
out
any
other
way
than
they
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
bankers
liability
rest
on
finding
if
they
made
a
misrepresentation
it
was
in
connection
with
the
sale,
not
that
they
were
a
seller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
sale
do
you
say
their
release
was
in
connection
with,
the
new
pledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
in
connection
with
the
new
pledge
that
you
say
they
made
a
misrepresentation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
say
that
we
do
not
have
before
us
the
question
of
whether
a
release
of
a
pledge
is
a
sale.
the
second
circuit
said
it
was
and,
if
that
were
sustainable,
you
might
get
one
result
in
this
case
and
if
it
was
not,
you
might
get
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
already
submitted
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pitt,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
to
justice
powell
that
there
was
not
any
case
authority
for
you
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
has
the
courts
held
that
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
’33
and
’34
act?
