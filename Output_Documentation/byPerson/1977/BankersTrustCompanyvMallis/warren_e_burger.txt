we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1359,
bankers
trust
against
mallis
and
kupferman.
mr.
weiner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
not
hesitate
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
read
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
relying
on
cases
that
arose
chiefly
under
the
’33
act
rather
than
the
’34
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
there
is
a
much
broader
definition
of
sale.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
warden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
all
those
matters
that
were
to
be
resolved
in
a
later
stage
in
the
proceeding
as
justice
stevens
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
read
the
1934
act
definitions
they
would
have
arrived
at
these
results
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
would
not
have
to
dealt
into
the
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hauser?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
second
circuit
opinion
seem
to
be
in
some
disagreement
with
you
on
whether
the
release
of
the
pledge
is
a
sale
or
with
bankers
trust?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pitt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think,
mr.
pitt,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
stands
independent
of
the
analysis
we
have
just
been
discussing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
the
bankers
trust
company
against
mallis
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
