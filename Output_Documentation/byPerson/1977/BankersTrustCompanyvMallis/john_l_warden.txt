mr.
john
l.
warden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
proposition
that
is
decisive
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
words
“purchase”
and
“sale”
used
in
the
1934
act
are
ordinary
words
and,
under
the
teachings
of
this
court,
must
therefore
be
accorded
their
commonly
accepted
meanings.
those
commonly
accepted
meanings
do
not
include
pledge
transaction.
that
is,
the
pledging
of
securities
or
other
property
or
the
release
of
a
pledge.
purchase
and
sale
involve
the
transfer
of
ownership
for
consideration.
a
pledge
does
not
transfer
ownership
or
a
general
property
interest
in
the
pledged
property.
i
might
say,
at
this
point
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
earlier
about
statutory
definition
that
does
include
pledge
that
is
in
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1935.
it's
inclusion
there,
we
submit,
shows
that
when
congress
wants
to
impose
upon
a
common
word
such
as
purchase
or
sale,
an
artificial
or
special
meaning
to
avoid
repetition
lengthy
number
of
terms
and
in
order
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
a
statute,
it
knows
perfectly
well
how
to
do
so.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
otherwise
that
either
the
1933
act
or
the
1934
act
was
intended
to
regulate
credit
transactions
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
on
a
face-to-face
basis.
as
professor
loss
has
pointed
out
in
criticizing
even
the
gil
films
decision,
under
the
’33
act,
federal
law
was
not
required
to
deal
with
the
individual
loan
transactions.
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
regulation
of
primary
and
secondary
public
securities
markets
of
this
country.
the
statutes
as
drafted,
of
course,
cover
personally
negotiated
purchases
and
sales,
a
point
made
by
the
sec
in
its
brief.
that
is
quite
true.
the
statute
as
drafted
both
of
them
do
cover
that.
that
indicates
that
congress
did
no
attempt
to
draw
the
line
between
public
trading
insecurities
and
private
purchases
and
sales
of
securities.
but,
it
did
deal
with
purchases
and
sales,
not
with
regulation
of
credit
transactions.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
sec,
in
its
brief,
have
suggested
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
purchase
and
sale
should
be
disregarded
because
of
the
statutory
definition
which
says
sale
includes
a
contract
to
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
off.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
the
addition
of
the
words
“or
otherwise
dispose
off”
was
intended
to
take
away
the
very
core
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“sale.”
in
fact,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
a
strict
definition
of
the
word
“sale”
as
obtained
at
that
time
involved
the
transfer
of
ownership
for
a
price
paid
in
money.
the
words”
and
otherwise
dispose
off”
extend
the
definition
of
the
word
“sale”
to
an
exchange
or
barter
transaction
or,
as
this
case
held
in
sec
against
national
securities,
a
statutory
merger
where
there
is,
in
fact,
an
exchange
of
ownership
but
not
for
consideration
in
money.
to
attempt
to
read
anything
more
into
those
words,
without
any
warrant
in
the
legislative
history
is
to
engage
in
construction
by
speculation.
mr.
john
l.
warden
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
it
would
probably
be
sufficient
if
there
were
a
purchase
and
sale
in
the
ordinary
informal
sense.
that
is,
if
i
said
to
someone
“i
will
sell
you
a
part
interest
in
the
100
shares
of
general
motors
that
i
own”
and
he
said
“fine,
i
will
pay
$1,000
for
that,”
and
i
took
it.
i
think
that
would
be
a
purchase
or
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
transfer
on
the
books
of
the
transfer
agent
or
turning
the
shares
and
to
get
250
share
certificates
would
be
required.
mr.
john
l.
warden
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
anything
that
was
done
or
alleged
to
have
been
done
by
bankers
trust
in
this
case
is
in
connection
with
the
transaction
of
which
the
plaintiffs
complain.
that
transaction,
as
mr.
weiner
pointed
out,
was
entirely
arranged
before
this
closing
occurred
in
the
offices
of
bankers
trust.
i
might
point
out
that
that
as
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
case
it
is
a
very
serious
concern
in
the
banking
community,
because
it
is
quite
a
common
thing
for
banks
which,
after
all,
maintain
conference
rooms
for
the
purposes
of
closings
to
afford
the
use
of
those
rooms
to
their
customers
for
the
conduct
of
transactions.
if
that
brings
one’s
activities
into
disputes
that
otherwise
do
not
involve
the
bank,
what
you
have
is
an
inhibition
on
a
bank’s
banking
facilities
available
to
people
which
does
not
include
the
public
interest
in
any
way.
mr.
john
l.
warden
it
is
not
quite
clear
from
reading
this
record.
i
happen
to
agree
with
justice
stewart
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
rather
hard
to
understand.
mr.
john
l.
warden
it
is
not
quite
clear.
what
it
is
that
supposedly
constituted
that
misrepresentation
or
how
it
was
in
connection
with
the
transaction
of
which
these
plaintiffs
complain,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
that
it
is
clear
from
the
facts,
and
there
are
more
facts
here
than
there
are
in
most
motion
to
dismiss
situations
and
there
are
a
lot
of
affidavits,
and
there
was
a
state
court
record
that
the
transaction
was
entirely
arranged
by
the
kates’
with
fowler
and
arnold.
fowler
and
arnold
found
these
plaintiffs
and
the
bankers
trust
co.
had
never
heard
of.
then,
the
closing
occurs
and
it
is
alleged
that
some
unknown
misrepresentation
was
made
at
that
closing.
but,
the
closing
was
a
ministerial
proceeding.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
decision
says.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
what
the
court
ruled,
no
but
i
think
that
does
indicate
your
honor,
you
are
quite
right.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
decision
says
and
this
court
must
assume
it.
but,
i
do
not
think
that
is
entirely
different
than
the
point
i
was
making
because
talk
of
that
kind
is
pretty
cheap
and
once
they
are
in
the
conference
room
and
these
transactions
occur
and
instruments
are
passed
across
the
title,
it
is
very
easy
for
someone
to
allege,
in
this
allegation
by
the
way,
three
years
after
the
state
court
complaint
was
dismissed,
the
allegation
of
misrepresentation
made
in
this
case
is
made
on
information.
three
years
after
their
case
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
state
court.
mr.
john
l.
warden
proceeding
from
there,
we
do
have
to
decide
whether
the
misrepresentation
was
in
any
way
“in
connection
with.”
what
is
that
misrepresentation
and
how
could
it
be
“in
connection
with?”
either
bankers
trust
would
have
to
be
considered
a
seller,
and
the
court
of
appeals
handled
that
problem
by
saying
that
the
release
of
the
pledge
is
a
sale
and
with
no
further
explication
at
all
and
all
the
release
of
the
pledge
is
a
performance
of
a
duty
imposed
on
the
bank
by
law
on
the
payment
of
the
loan,
or
somehow
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
that
bankers
trust
was
an
aider
and
abettor
in
this
court
as
expressly
reserved
in
blue
chip
stamps
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
civil
liability
for
aiding
and
abetting
under
10b5.
one
of
the
other
of
those
bridges
would
have
to
be
crossed
in
order
to
make
this
misrepresentation
that
this
court
must
assume
existed,
and
i
quite
agree.
mr.
john
l.
warden
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
are
both
questions
of
law.
whether
a
release
of
a
pledge
is
a
sale
under
10b
is
a
question
of
law.
i
submit
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
it
is
not.
whether
there
is
civil
liability
for
aiding
and
abetting
under
10b5
is
a
question
of
law.
then,
if
that
question
is
answered
in
the
affirmative,
the
plaintiff
would
be
free
to
attempt
to
prove
the
aiding
and
abetting.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
warden
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
our
position
that
these
statutes
on
their
face
and
in
the
history
were
not
passed
to
regulate
credit
transactions
and
that
a
loan,
whether
or
not
secured
by
stock
or
other
property,
remains
a
loan
and
is
not,
as
the
sec
contends,
an
investment
in
securities.
thank
you.
