do
you
say
they
are
simple?
justice
potter
stewart
i
read
the
briefs
in
this
case
a
week
ago
on
an
airplane
and
i
thought
i
was
going
crazy.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
altitude
was
getting
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
mr.
kupferman
somewhere
in
here
too.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
weiner,
when
you
talk
about
the
act
i
take
it
you
are
talking
about
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1944.
justice
potter
stewart
i
looked
at
the
complaint
and
the
action
seems
to
have
been
brought
out
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
clear
now
all
around
that
this
is
a
complaint
under
the
1934
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
rule
10b5.
justice
potter
stewart
promulgated
under
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
does
not
indicate
that.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
weiner,
do
you
contend
there
is
a
difference
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
“sale”
between
the
’33
act
and
the
’34
act?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
’34.
justice
potter
stewart
and
rule
10b5
promulgated
there
under.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there
has
to
be
a
transfer
of
title,
so
to
speak,
or
transfer
of
ownership?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
are
not
talking
here
at
all
about
the
pledge
by
kates
to
bankers
trust
nor
the
release
by
bankers
trust
of
the
collateral.
justice
potter
stewart
again,
that
is
quite
a
deviation
from
the
second
circuit’s
reasoning,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
not
quite
a
deviation
from
the
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
pledge.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
release
to
kates
by
bankers
trust
of
the
collateral
was
a
sale,
it
said
that.
justice
potter
stewart
then
we
have
now
a
third
theory
to
support
10b5
liability,
i.e.
that
bankers
trust’s
made
a
misrepresentation
in
connection
with
a
sale
from
'a'
to
'b',
bankers
trust
being
x'.
that
is
the
theory
that
was
just
passed
by
your
brother,
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
you.
it
is
your
brothers,
i
say.
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
no
judgment
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
a
motion
is
not
a
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
they
say
every
good
case
requires
a
mystery
document.
in
this
case,
the
missing
document
is
the
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
purchase
or
a
sale
as
within
the
meaning
of
the
’34
act
and
10b5.
as
my
brother
powell
suggested,
that
question
is
wholly
interdependent
on
whether
there
had
ever
been
a
pledge
by
a
case
to
bankers
trust.
justice
potter
stewart
this
bank
is
not
planning
about
the
protections
of
the
act.
the
banks
in
this
situation
are
going
to
be
defendants,
not
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
this
controversy.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
no
part
of
what
is
before
us
now,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
have
is
the
pleadings.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
we
have
here
is
a
fairly
precise
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
pledge
is
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
’34
act.
justice
potter
stewart
what
confused
me
was
that
you
and
your
brief
were
talking
about
the
pledge
by
kates
to
bankers
trust
and
the
release
of
the
pledge
and
the
sec
is
talking
about
quite
a
different
pledge.
they
are
talking
about
the
one
that
arnold
and
fowler
had
made
to
mallis
and
kupferman
of
the
equity
national
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
does
and
that
is
what
makes
this
case
actually
confusing.
but,
the
single
issue
is
a
rather
precise
one
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits.
