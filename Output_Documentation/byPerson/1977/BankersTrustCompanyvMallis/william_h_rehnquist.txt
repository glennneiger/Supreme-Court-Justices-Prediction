justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
just
isolate,
if
i
may,
the
very
first
part
of
the
transaction
which
you
described
where
the
bankers
trust
received
the
pledge
from
the
georgia
bank.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
from
mr.
kates.
would
you
do
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
mr.
kates
had
made
a
fraudulent
representation
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
securities
that
he
was
pledging
to
bankers
trust
and
bankers
trust
alleged
that
it
relied
on
that
representation
that
bankers
trust
would
not
have
a
10b5
action
against
kates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
proceed
against
him?
you
certainly
could
not
proceed
against
him
on
the
note
under
10b5.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
proceed
against
him
by
virtue
of
the
fraudulent
representation
in
connection
with
the
pledge
by
virtue
of
10b5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
not
asking
if
you
need
it.
i
was
asking
whether
it
would
be
available
if
your
management
changed
and
the
new
management
thought
you
did
need
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
right
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
denied
lease
to
amend,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
cannot
file
a
motion
for
discovery
until
you
have
received
permission
to
file
your
amended
complaint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
denied
lease
to
amend.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
cannot
complain
about
the
lack
of
discovery.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
said
they
knew
they
were
in
trouble,
do
you
mean
they
knew
the
pledge
they
had
taken
as
security
was
very
likely
worthless.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
their
affidavit
was
not
before
judge
pollack?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plaintiffsâ€™
affidavit
was
before
judge
pollack.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
an
information.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
no
good.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
then
is
that
a
fraudulent
representation
by
someone
who
himself
is
not
a
seller
is
actionable
under
10b5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
not
suggest
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
for
its
decision
to
hold
that
a
pledge
was
a
sale?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
be
interested
to
hear
what
you
would
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
can
rely
on
the
sale
from
arnold
to
mallis
and
the
misrepresentation
made
by
bankers
trust
was
in
connection
with
the
sale.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
amend
not
a
motion
to
dismiss,
is
it
not?
