mr.
noel
w.
hauser
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
to
the
respondents,
i
have
agreed
to
share
my
argument
time
with
the
general
counsel
to
the
sec
and
he
will
generally
argue
that
a
pledge
of
stock
is
the
equivalent
of
a
sale
for
the
purposes
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
that,
therefore,
the
respondents
have
standing
as
pledgees
to
sue.
the
appellants,
it
seems
to
me,
have
spent
most
of
their
argument
time
in
arguing
against
the
position
taken
by
the
sec
in
their
brief
amicus
curiae
to
this
court.
i,
on
the
other
hand,
represent
some
people
who
are
out
$156,000
as
a
result
of
what
i
consider
to
be
egregious
fraud.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
apparently
have
had
some
problem
in
obtaining
the
facts
from
this
record
which
comes
about
because
judge
pollack
dismissed
the
complaint
before
any
discovery
and
even
in
advance
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
he
denied
lease
to
amend.
he
refused
no
opportunity
to
discover
any
facts
which
would
allow
the
opportunity
to
discover
the
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
that
is
correct.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
he
denied
that
lease.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
well,
i
can
complain
about
it
in
this
respect.
in
woodward
against
the
bank
of
dallas,
which
is
cited
by
the
briefs
by
the
parties
to
this
court,
the
district
court
in
a
similar
pledge
situation
held
and
held
twice
before
the
trial
that
dismissal
in
a
pledge
situation
of
a
10b5
case
would
be
premature
because
the
plaintiff
might
be
able
to
prove
enough
facts
to
spell
out
the
requisite
standing
to
sue
as
required
by
rule
10b5.
eventually,
when
the
case
did
reach
the
fifth
circuit,
i
think
it
was,
the
court
dismissed
the
complaint
but
not
on
the
basis
that
there
was
not
any
jurisdiction.
they
expressly
found
there
was
jurisdiction
where
stock
had
been
pledged
to
a
bank,
dismissed
it
on
the
ground
that
the
bank’s
knowledge
of
what
had
occurred
with
respect
to
a
fraud
was
insufficient
to
impose
liability
upon
them.
we
would
deny
that
opportunity.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
the
amount
that
the
plaintiffs
are
out
at
this
time
is
$156,000
plus
five
years
interest.
as
regards
to
their
action
in
the
state
court,
it
has
been
dismissed
against
bankers
trust
co.
they
have
no
claim
against
bankers
trust
co.
now.
the
only
thing
they
have
is
a
claim
against
the
so-called
buyers
of
record
are
arnold
and
fowler
for
deceit,
breach
of
contract,
malpractice,
whatever
else
they
could
think
of.
those
parties
in
their
turn
have
asserted
a
third
party
claim
against
bankers
trust
co.
but,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
have
bankers
trust
co.
as
a
direct
defendant
of
that
action.
there
were
restrictions
on
the
transferability
of
the
stocks
in
question
and
they
were
spelled
out
on
the
certificates
themselves.
they
are
made
a
part
of
the
record
of
pages
34
and
38.
bankers
was
advised
by
hand-delivered
letter
from
the
issue
of
the
securities
equity
national
industries
in
march
of
1971
that
these
stocks
were
worthless.
at
that
time,
they
held
the
stock
as
collateral
having
received
it
from
jerome
kates.
they
received
a
second
letter
from
the
issuer
in
april
of
1971.
they
knew
they
were
in
trouble
with
this
stock
in
kates
because
they
went
so
far
as
to
reduce
their
claim
to
judgment
on
july
20,
1971.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
absolutely.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
common
experience
on
the
part
of
banks
which
have
made
loans
to
reduce
their
claims
to
judgment
where
they
hold
collateral.
but,
in
this
case,
they
did
so.
on
july
20,
1971,
judgment
was
entered
in
favor
of
bankers
and
against
jerome
kates
and
judith
kates
who
had
pledged
the
stock
to
the
bank.
in
february
of
1972,
the
issue
commenced
an
action
in
the
district
court.
on
march
3,
1972,
a
closing
took
place.
bankers
says,
and
there
is
no
support
for
it
in
the
record,
that
they
were
served
with
a
summons
and
complaint
in
the
action
which
had
been
filed
a
month
before
in
the
district
court
on
march
10th
1973
one
week
to
the
day
after
the
closing.
in
a
state
court
action,
they
thereafter
made
the
representation
to
the
court
that
they
believed
on
the
closing
that
the
stock
was
valuable.
they
certainly
made
that
same
representation
in
the
closing
room
when
my
clients
through
a
representative
of
the
franklin
national
bank
expended
the
sum
of
$156,000.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
the
plaintiffs
have
an
affidavit
as
part
of
the
record.
it
appears
as
part
of
the
record
that
an
affirmative
representation
was
made
by
a
representative
of
the
bankers
trust
co.
i
understand
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
facts
which
are
not
on
the
record.
but,
for
whatever
it
is
worth,
i
can
make
the
affirmative
representation
that
i
have
an
affidavit
of
my
own
file
to
that
effect.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
the
affidavit
was
not
obtained
until
after
the
record
was
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
the
plaintiffs’
affidavit
was
before
judge
pollack.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
it
was.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
it
is
included
in
the
record
to
this
court.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
do
you
mean,
in
the
complaint
which
we
were
not
allowed
to
amend?
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
the
affidavit
alleges
that
affirmative
representation.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
page
110.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
sir.
yes,
page
110.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
will
quote
the
language
exactly.
“we
are
informed
by
our
attorneys
and
believe
that
we
have
a
good
meritorious
cause
of
action
against
the
defendants,
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
european-american
bank,
as
well
as
franklin
national
bank.”
i
will
skip
down
to
b:
“against
bankers
trust
co.
which
withheld
vitally
material
information
from
us
and
our
representatives
and,
as
we
are
informed,
actually
misrepresented
that
the
securities
in
question
were
genuine
when,
in
fact,
they
were
not.”
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
by
the
representative.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
“bankers
trust
co.
withheld
vitally
material
information
from
us
and
our
representatives.”
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
right
here.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
it
is.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
we
were
denied
the
opportunity,
as
i
mentioned
before,
to
amend
our
complaint
so
as
to
affirmatively
allege
it.
we
have
not
had
that
opportunity.
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
court
should
affirm
the
second
circuit’s
decision.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
whatever
the
plaintiffs
may
have
understood
this
transaction
to
have
meant
to
them.
they
say
that
they
were
lenders.
they
understood
that
they
were
lenders.
but,
the
only
document
in
the
record
which
indicates
what
their
relationship
with
was
with
arnold
and
fowler
appears
at
page
49
of
the
record.
i
would
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
the
language
of
the
letter.
“your
participation
in
the
purchase,”
says
mr.
arnold
to
mr.
mallis,
“your
advance
of
156,000
toward
the
purchase
price,”
“your
participation
in
the
trade,”
“your
investment,”
and
finally,
“you
will
be
reimbursed.”
a
loan
presupposes
that
it
will
be
repaid.
but,
nowhere
in
that
letter
does
it
say
by
whom.
i
do
not
think
that
any
member
of
this
court
would
grant
summary
judgment
against
arnold
or
fowler
on
the
theory
that
he
received
a
loan
from
mallis
or
kates.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
did
not
borrow
the
money
that
neither
mallis
nor
kates
was
a
lender,
and
i
think
it
is
too
early
to
conclude
what
their
position
was,
certainly
it
can
conclusively
assume
that
they
were
lenders
rather
than
participants
in
the
trade.
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
they
were
lenders.
if,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
starting
point
for
the
determination
of
standing
to
sue
under
the
rule
10b5
is
the
statute
and
the
statute
says
that
a
fraud
made
“in
connection
with”
a
sale
is
the
trigger
for
a
10b5
liability.
of
course,
there
was
a
sale
here.
the
reason
that
the
case
is
perhaps
a
little
confusing
is
because
it
is
sandwiched
in
between
the
release
of
one
pledge
and
the
creation
of
another
pledge.
but,
the
pledge
to
mallis
and
kupferman
was
simultaneous
with
the
purchase
by
arnold
and
fowler
if,
indeed,
they
were
the
purchasers.
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
arnold,
when
he
signed
the
purchase
agreement,
signed
it
as
attorney.
that
is
in
a
representative
capacity.
now,
there
could
have
been
no
sale
except
for
the
fact
that
mallis
and
kupferman
came
with
the
money
through
their
representative,
of
course,
to
a
closing.
at
the
closing,
their
money
was
expended
and
the
sale
took
place.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
exactly
right.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
no.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
not
from
bankers
trust.
i
do
not
claim
that
bankers
trust
was
a
seller.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
believe
that
the
mere
release
of
a
pledge
is
a
sale,
no.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
believe
that
bankers
trust
was
a
seller.
i
do
not
believe
that.
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
were
the
seller.
the
next
question
is
were
the
plaintiffs
connected.
they
advanced
at
the
closing
86%
of
the
purchase
price
of
this
stock
and
they
received
at
the
closing
all
of
the
things
sold.
they
were
more
connected
than
arnold
was
because
arnold
put
up
less
than
24%
of
the
purchase
price.
there
could
have
been
no
sale
without
the
use
of
their
funds
at
the
closing.
they
were
directly
and
intimately
connected
with
the
sale.
to
say
that
they
were
not
imposed
upon
“in
connection
with,”
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
sale
is
to
make
a
mockery
of
what
the
statute
calls
for.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
i
do
not
think
that
to
the
extent
that
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
release
by
bankers
of
the
pledge
was
a
sale
of
stock,
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary
to
their
decision.
i
think
that
all
of
that
was
required.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
do
i
think
they
thought
it
was
a
sale?
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same
way
strictly
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
were
buyers
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
absolutely.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
right,
i
say
that
if
the
sale
occurs
at
the
identical
time
as
does
the
pledge,
the
pledge
is
in
connection
with
the
sale.
you
cannot
have
a
sale
without
a
pledge.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
how
do
i
view
whether
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
that.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
conclusion
as
to
whether
every
pledge
ipso
facto
constitutes
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
so
thought.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
i
do
not
necessarily
defend
that
conclusion.
i
do
know
that
somehow
somewhere,
i
do
not
know
exactly
when,
where
fraudulent
securities
are
pledged
to
a
pledgee,
i
know
that
somewhere
there
comes
a
time
that
the
pledgee
has
standing
to
sue
for
a
violation
of
rule
10b5.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
a
question
during
the
course
of
mr.
weiner’s
argument,
what
would
happen
if
a
note
was
given
and
stock
given
back
in
exchange.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
and
mr.
weiner
responded
that
there
would
not
be
any
answer,
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
go
to
10b5
remedy.
but
suppose,
for
example,
that
the
note
itself
was
a
forgery
and
the
fellow
had
sent
along
his
collateral
and
now
denied
liability
although
conceding
that
he
had
signed
the
stock
for
whatever
purpose.
the
bank
would
be
foreclosed
from
suing
on
the
debt,
but
they
would
not
be
foreclosed
from
suing
under
10b5
and
it
is
not
a
farfetched
possibility.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
positively.
specifically.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes.
the
plaintiffs
are
the
new
pledgee.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
yes,
i
say
that
the
sale
as
to
which
the
pledgee
generates
with
the
use
of
his
funds
is
sufficient
to
supply
the
statutory
requirement
of
“in
connection
with”
a
sale.
mr.
noel
w.
hauser
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is.
