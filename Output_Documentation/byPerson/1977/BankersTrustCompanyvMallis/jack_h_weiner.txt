it
please
the
court.
section
10b
and
rule
10b5
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
does
not
prescribe
all
fraudulent
schemes
that
have
anything
to
do
with
securities.
it
only
prescribes
and
renders
unlawful,
those
fraudulent
schemes
that
are
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
securities.”
this
case
presents
two
questions.
one,
whether
a
pledge
of
securities
as
collateral
or
commercial
loan
was
a
purchase
or
sale
herein
within
the
meaning
of
the
1934
act
which
defines
purchase
“to
include
any
contract
to
buy,
purchase,
or
otherwise
acquire”
to
permit
a
pledgee
to
bring
in
action
under
section
10b
and
rule
10b5.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
“in
connection
with”
requirements
of
the
act
is
satisfied
when
a
bank
which
releases
collectible
to
its
debtor
upon
the
repayment
of
the
indebtedness
as
it
was
required
to
do
under
law
and
the
alleged
sale
is
the
pledge
of
securities
to
a
plaintiff
who
is
totally
unknown
to
the
bank.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
fairly
simple.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes,
your
honor,
they
are
fairly
simple.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
well,
maybe
i
could
help
clarify
them
for
you,
justice
stewart.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
maybe
i
can
help
clarify
and
feel
free
to
interrupt
and
ask
any
questions,
justice
stewart.[laughter]
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
thank
you,
sir.
bankers
trust
is
a
bank.
it
received
approximately
40,000
shares
of
equity
national
stock
as
collateral
for
a
loan
in
august
of
1970.
at
that
time,
the
lending
officers
received
an
opinion
letter
of
counsel
that
the
stock
would
be
negotiable
within
six
months.
when
a
bank
receives
a
pledge
of
stock,
it
does
not
look
to
the
collateral
for
repayment.
it
primarily
asks
how
the
indebtedness
is
going
to
be
repaid
and
looks
at
the
credit
worthiness
of
the
borrower
plus
other
elements
relating
to
repayment.
a
banker
does
not
make
a
loan
with
the
expectation
that
he
is
going
to
be
required
to
foreclose
on
collateral
to
collect
its
indebtedness
regardless
of
whether
the
collateral
has
stock,
real
estate,
cattle,
or
accounts
receivable
financing.
a
banker
does
not
want
to
be
involved
in
an
expensive
foreclosure
proceeding.
he
does
not
want
to
have
to
use
lawyers.
he
merely
wants
a
return
of
the
moneys
he
loaned.
the
bank,
in
this
case,
played
no
role
whatsoever
in
arranging
with
mallis
and
kupferman
,
the
respondents
herein,
to
borrow
money
from
franklin
national
bank
which
they
then
loaned
to
arnold
and
fowlers
and
received
their
pledge
back
up
collateral
from
arnold
and
fowlers.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
it
did
not.
it
received
it
from
mr.
kates.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
our
position
is
that
bankers
trust
co.
does
not
need
to
proceed
against
him
in
10b5
at
the
time
he
pledged
the
collateral.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
no,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
it
does
not
need
that.
he
would
have
executed
a
note
at
that
time
as
well
as
the
pledge
of
collateral
and
we
could
proceed
against
him
on
the
note.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
no,
we
would
not
need
that.
we
would
proceed
against
him
in
state
court.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
our
position
is
we
do
not
need
that
as
a
remedy.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
sale
when
you
are
on
the
pledge.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
do
you
have
any
other
questions,
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
okay.
the
loan
was
in
the
process
of
being
repaid.
in
1971,
a
dispute
arose
between
kates,
the
pledger,
and
equity
national,
the
issuer
of
the
stock.
bankers
was
informed
to
the
dispute
by
equity
national
who
asked
that
the
stock
be
returned
to
them.
they
then
contacted
kates
and
kates’
attorneys
advised
bankers
not
to
return
the
collateral
but
he
was
entitled
to
return
of
the
collateral
upon
repayment
of
the
indebtedness.
bankers
then
informed
equity
national
that
it
was
obligated
to
return
the
collateral
to
its
borrower,
kates,
upon
repayment
of
the
indebtedness.
it
might
consider
it
talking
to
equity
national
if
it
were
indemnified.
equity
national
did
nothing.
a
year
later,
negotiations
began
between
kates,
arnold,
and
fowler
with
respect
to
the
equity
national
stock
as
well
as
a
block
of
odd
100,000
shares
of
merck
stock.
at
that
time,
kates
wanted
to
have
these
transactions
handled
together.
bankers
did
not
introduce
kates
to
arnold
and
fowler.
it
had
not
relationship
there.
on
february
24,
1972,
a
contract
of
sale
was
entered
into
between
kates,
arnold,
and
fowler
with
respect
to
the
equity
national
stock
and
with
respect
to
the
merck
stock.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
no,
he
comes
in
later
in
the
picture.
he
is
much
later
in
the
picture,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
the
sale
between
kates
to
arnold
and
fowler
is
a
sale.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct,
sir.
in
that
contract,
the
closing
was
scheduled
for
february
29.
on
february
29th
,
apparently,
arnold
and
fowler
did
not
have
the
$156,000
but
fowler
gave
kates
an
additional
$10,000
to
get
an
extension
of
time.
he
received
a
four
or
five
day
extension
of
time
for
this
thing.
again,
this
was
unknown
to
bankers.
unknown
to
bankers,
mallis
had
some
dealings
with
mr.
arnold
on
or
about
march
1.
arnold
told
mallis
of
the
deal
and
he
said,
someone
could
make
some
money
if
they
would
loan
him
the
funds
for
which
he
would
be
able
to
consummate
the
transaction
which
he
was
going
to
make
$400,000
out
of
for
180,000.
arnold
suggested
that
he
participate.
in
his
affidavits,
mr.
mallis
states
the
suggestion
was
also
by
mr.
murfet
of
franklin
national
bank.
mr.
murfet
of
franklin
national
bank
told
mallis
that
kates
enjoyed
a
good
reputation
in
the
business
world
and
that
the
securities
appeared
worthwhile
and
free
of
any
restrictions.
then,
there
was
an
agreement
by
mallis
and
kupferman
to
borrow
moneys
from
franklin
and
loan
the
money
to
arnold
and
fowler.
bankers,
again,
was
totally
unaware
of
this.
bankers
was
not
privy
to
any
of
these
transactions
with
mallis
and
kupferman.
on
the
morning
of
march
3,
mallis
and
kupferman
went
into
the
offices
of
franklin
national
bank
in
the
suburbs.
they
signed
the
necessary
documents.
then,
mallis
was
told
by
murfet
“no
need
to
be
present.”
he
expected
the
transaction
to
be
paid
by
a
sale
of
100,000
shares
of
merck
and
co.
stock.
the
pledged
transaction
was
a
usurious
contract
because
dr.
mallis,
at
the
time
he
loaned
these
gentlemen
$156,000,
was
going
to
make
“a
profit
of
of
$50,000
within
30
days.”
arithmetically
computed
that
comes
to
383%.
this
was
raised
by
mr.
fowler
in
the
state
court
action.
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
no
one
alleges
that
bankers
trust
nor
any
of
its
representatives
including
its
attorneys
did
anything
either
by
action
or
non-action
until
the
closing
on
the
afternoon
of
march
3.
bankers
did
not
introduce
kates
to
arnold
and
fowler.
bankers
did
not
even
know
the
existence
of
mallis
and
kupferman
until
after
the
closing
and
the
beginning
of
these
lawsuits.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
it
does
not
have
any
real
relevance
to
the
issue.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
but
they
go
to
the
“in
connection
with.”
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes,
in
connection
with
arguments.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct,
sir.
bankers’
only
function
at
the
collateral
was
to
return
collateral
to
its
debtor,
kates,
upon
repayment
of
the
indebtedness
as
it
was
required
to
do
under
the
new
york
uniform
commercial
code.
at
the
closing,
arnold
asked
kates
for
an
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
respondents,
mallis
and
kupferman.
on
the
basis
of
information
furnished
by
fowler,
he
knew
that
there
was
a
problem
between
equity
national,
kates,
and
arnold.
fowler
had
contacted
the
president
of
equity
national
and
he
told
arnold
of
this.
that
is
in
the
deposition
in
the
state
court
which
we
just
obtained.
arnold
accepted
an
affidavit
from
kates
saying
that
there
were
no
restrictions.
at
that
time,
bankers
had
not
knowledge
with
respect
to
these
transactions.
the
stock
was
redeemed
by
mr.
kates
and
it
was
returned
to
the
kates’.
indeed,
at
the
closing,
a
check
was
offered
to
bankers
trust
co.
made
payable
to
bankers
trust
co.
and
kates.
bankers
trust
co.
refused
to
touch
that
check
because
bankers
trust
said
“i
am
not
privy
to
any
of
these
transactions.”
eventually,
a
state
court
of
action
was
instituted
against
bankers.
that
action
was
dismissed.
the
court
there
said
that
how
could
bankers
be
liable
when
they
did
not
know
these
people
and
had
nothing
these
people.
at
the
same
time
that
action
was
dismissed,
a
suit
against
fowler
and
arnold
who
were
still
part
of
that
action
alleging
a
breach
of
contract
as
well
as
fraud.
fowler
and
arnold
instituted
third
party
actions
on
the
breach
of
contracts
against
bankers.
these
actions
are
still
pending
in
the
state
court.
indeed,
the
deposition
of
mallis
by
bankers
is
now
scheduled
for
february
1,
1978.
this
is
clearly
an
analogous
situation
to
the
blue
chip
case
and
bourbon
whereby
there
is
a
remedy
in
state
court,
the
cases
are
still
pending
in
the
state
court,
and
there
is
no
need
for
10b
or
10b5
in
this
situation.
it
is
our
position
that
a
pledge
of
stock
is
not
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
plain
language
of
the
act
in
blue
chip
stamps
and
hawk
felder,
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
there,
stated
that
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
judicially
created
right
the
court
must
construe
the
statute
narrowly.
the
statute
requires
that
there
would
be
a
purchase
or
sale.
a
pledger
of
stock
is
not
a
seller
of
stock.
all
right,
title,
and
interest
remain
in
the
pledger.
the
pledger
has
the
right
to
the
dividends.
he
has
all
voting
rights.
any
increase
in
value
of
the
stock
remains
in
the
pledger.
he
has
the
right
to
dispose
off
the
securities
when
and
to
whomever
he
wishes.
a
pledge
is
merely
a
security
interest.
the
pledgee,
as
his
bankers,
must
act
in
accordance
with
the
law.
the
uniform
commercial
code
very
carefully
defines
the
duties
and
obligations
of
a
pledgee
in
that
situation.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
the
action
was
originally
instituted
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
in
fact,
they
even
assert
in
that
that
the
only
obligation
of
bankers
was
to
return
the
collateral
to
mr.
kates.
subsequent
thereto,
there
were
various
attempts
to
amend
the
complaint
and
they
attempted
to
amend
the
complaint
by
making
numerous
affidavits
to
judge
pollack.
judge
pollack
treated
these
affidavits
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
an
amended
complaint
and
treated
this
as
if
it
were
an
action
under
the
1934
act
and
rule
10b5.
that
is
how
it
proceeded
from
judge
pollack
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct.
we
are
litigating
it
as
--
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
and
rule
10b5.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
i
know
it
does
not.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes,
there
is.
there
is
a
very
plain
difference,
sir.
the
sale
in
the
’33
act
is
much
broader
than
it
is
in
the
’34
act.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
no,
it
does
not.
they
say
“otherwise
disposed
of
an
interest
for
value.”
we
would
prefer
that
that
act
also
be
construed
as
not
including
a
pledge.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
pardon?
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
the
sec,
allan
troop,
the
general
counsels,
and
it
was
cited
in
our
brief,
refer
to
that
definition,
and
they
indicate
that
a
pledge
was
not
a
sale
for
purposes
of
the
1933
act.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
we
are
dealing
with
the
’34
act,
sir.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
there
is
none
in
the
act,
sir.
it
is
just
sale
and
purchase.
i
am
saving
time
for
clearinghouse.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
its
recent
decisions
in
santa
fe,
piper,
blue
chip
stamps,
congress
in
enacting
the
1934
securities
act
did
not
intend
to
create
a
federal
commercial
law.
congress
merely
intended
to
regulate
the
sale
and
purchase
of
securities
as
an
investment.
congress
did
not
intend
to
get
involved
with
lending
the
commercial
paper
situation
in
this
area.
indeed,
if
we
would
broadly
construe
purchase
for
10b5
purposes,
as
sought
by
the
sec
and
as
found
by
the
second
circuit,
would
render
an
unmanageable
flood
of
litigation.
whenever
a
loan
goes
into
default,
the
debtor
pledgee
frequently
would
utilize
any
source
to
avoid
and
delay
repayment
of
an
obligation
because,
as
this
court
is
aware,
the
federal
laws
are
very
extensive
with
respect
to
discovery,
and
summary
judgment
is
more
difficult
to
get
in
the
federal
courts
than
it
is
in
the
state
court
action.
federal
courts
have
a
sufficient
burden
to
handle
litigation
which
is
properly
before
it.
they
should
not
be
and
do
not
need
to
be
involved
in
extensive
litigation
which
is
properly
the
subject
of
state
court
action.
as
the
sec
and
mallis
assert,
anytime
a
transaction
touches
securities
the
transactions
will
be
subject
to
the
federal
courts
and
the
scope
of
10b
and
10b5
will
be
extended
far
beyond
what
congress
intended.
congress
plainly
did
not
intend
to
include
as
part
of
the
securities
laws
the
release
of
collateral
from
a
pledge.
although,
as
justice
stevens
asked,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
misrepresentation
and
there
was
no
purchase.
nonetheless,
before
an
action
can
be
instituted
the
plaintiff
must
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement
in
connection
between
the
alleged
misrepresentation
and
the
purchase
or
sale.
there
must
be
a
nexus
or
causation
between
the
defendants
and
the
plaintiff.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
nexus.
bankers
did
not
know
of
their
existence.
bankers
accepted
the
pledge
of
collateral
on
august
1970.
its
customer
redeemed
the
collateral
on
march
3,
1972.
the
contract
had
been
entered
into
to
purchase
the
collateral
on
february
26
and
everything
had
been
locked
in
long
before
there
was
any
participation
of
bankers
at
the
closing.
there
is
no
possible
way
of
imposing
upon
bankers
a
duty
to
make
any
disclosure
when
it
did
not
even
know
these
people’s
existence.
bankers
was
only
a
passive
participant
in
a
transaction
organized
by
arnold
and
mallis.
the
court
of
appeals
sought
to
place
a
connecting
link
by
finding
that
bankers
was
a
seller
by
the
release
of
the
collateral
and
mallis
and
kupferman
purchasers
by
virtue
of
the
acceptance
of
the
pledge.
but,
this
finding
skips
two
intervening
transactions.
bankers
release
the
collateral
to
kates.
kates
had
sold
the
stock
to
arnold
and
fowler.
arnold
and
fowler
may
have
pledged
the
stock
to
mallis
and
kupferman.
there
was
no
real
connection
in
this
situation.
a
bank’s
release
of
a
collateral
to
its
debtor
is
plainly
no
representation
of
the
value
of
the
collateral
to
any
third
party
nor
of
its
bona
fides
to
any
unknown
third
party.
as
judge
cardosa
stated
in
moris
and
recognized
by
this
court
in
blue
chip
stamps
and
hawk

to
hold
bankers
trust
liable
in
this
case
would
be
to
extend
liability
in
an
indeterminate
amount
for
an
indeterminate
time
to
an
indeterminate
class.
congress

not

intend
to

mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct,
sir,
but
the
gentile
and
guilt
going
for
both
’33
act
cases.
they
were
both
enforcement
actions.
in
fact,
this
court
in
national
securities
stated
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
10b5
action
and
enforcement
action.
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
did.
thank
you.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
i
thought
i
had
a
few
minutes
left.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes.
your
honor,
mr.
pitt
referred
to
the
phrase
“interest”
in
definition
of
sale.
that
is
not
in
the
1934
act.
that
is
in
the
1933
act.
the
1934
act
very
clearly
speaks
about
sale
or
other
disposition
thereof.
that
is
one
point.
the
second
point
that
is
important
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
buying
stock
to
make
a
collateralized
loan
and
making
a
collateralized
loan.
the
lending
factor
which
we
sought
to
stress
earlier
is
based
on
the
general
credit
of
the
individual.
they
are
not
looking
at
the
value
of
collateral.
the
gil
films
case,
which
is
the
first
time
that
the
sec
really
pushed
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
pledge
was
a
sale,
was
in
1960.
professor
loss
refers
to
that
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
sham
transaction
and
it
was
not
a
pure
bona
fide
pledge
and
they
expanded
the
question
therein.
now,
one
of
the
factors
that
is
really
very,
very
important
here
is
that
a
lot
has
been
stated
about
what
is
beyond
the
record.
subsequent,
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
some
facts
which
have
just
come
to
our
attention
as
a
result
of
the
state
court
action.
we
have
just
completed
the
deposition
of
mr.
fowler.
in
this
examination,
mr.
fowler
makes
it
clear.
number
one,
he
was
aware
of
the
conflict
and
he
and
arnold
were
fully
aware
of
the
conflict
between
equity
national
industries
and
the
kates’.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
yes.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
i
recognize
that,
sir.
but,
there
have
been
numerous
allegations
totally
without
merit.
i
would
like
this
court
to
remember
that.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
and
whether
or
not
it
was
“in
connection
with.”
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
because
the
court
of
appeals
speaks
about
it.
mr.
jack
h.
weiner
and
whether
or
not
it
was
“in
connection
with”
also.
that
is
a
subsidiary
question,
also,
your
honor.
thank
you.
