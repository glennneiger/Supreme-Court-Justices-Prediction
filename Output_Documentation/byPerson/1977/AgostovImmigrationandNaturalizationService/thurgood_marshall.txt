justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
after
a
series
of
hearing
before
immigration
judge,
a
petitioner
was
found
to
be
an
alien.
unlawfully
in
this
country
he
was
already
deported.
petitioner
sought
review
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
section
106
(a)
(5)
b
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
section
requires
a
court
of
appeals
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
de
novo
hearing
on
any
non-frivolous
claim
of
american
citizenship
if
"a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
the
petitioner's
nationality
is
presented."
the
court
of
appeals,
with
judge
dissenting,
affirmed
the
deportation
order,
and
refused
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
district
court,
apparently
because
petitioner
had
not
presented
"substantial
evidence"
in
support
of
his
claim
of
citizenship.
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
finding
that
a
district
court
hearing
is
required
only
when
"substantial
evidence"
is
presented
in
support
of
a
citizenship
claim.
that
construction
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
rather
than
incorporating
language
requiring
"substantial
evidence",
congress
used
the
same
language
that
governs
for
motion
for
summary
judgment
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
56.
and
applying
summary
judgment
principles
in
this
case
that
therefore
follows
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
hearing
in
a
district
court.
while
the
government's
evidence
would
suffice,
if
uncontradicted,
to
establish
petitioner
had
been
born
in
italy
that
evidence
was
not
uncontradicted.
petitioner's
several
witnesses
testified
that
he
had
been
born
in
this
country
to
an
italian
mother
and
then
was
sent
to
italy
as
a
small
child,
thus
there
was
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
for
the
district
court
to
resolve.
