justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
involves
only
one
person,
a
clever
and
resourceful
ex-convict.
it
is
important
because
it
illustrates
and
may
set
a
precedent
as
to
how
a
system
can
be
exploited.
i
repeat
some
of
the
facts.
for
some
11
years
the
government
has
been
trying
to
deport
petitioner,
supported
by
authenticated
documentary
evidence
as
to
his
birth
and
marriage,
the
immigration
service
says
that
petitioner
was
born
in
italy
and
entered
the
united
states
in
1966
by
fraud
and
deception.
he
has
criminal
records
both
in
italy
and
in
this
country.
petitioner
claims
without
documentary
evidence
of
any
kind
that
he
was
born
in
cleveland.
since
this
proceeding
was
instituted
in
1967,
there
have
been
three
separate
evidentiary
hearings
before
immigration
judges,
three
appeals
to
the
board
of
immigrations
appeal,
one
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
during
this
total
of
eight
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings,
and
in
certain
other
proceedings,
petitioner
has
told
five
different
stories
with
respect
to
his
nationality.
he
has
invented
new
fabrications
whenever
they
served
his
purposes.
not
until
the
third
hearing,
some
four
years
after
the
first
hearing,
the
petitioner
present
any,
corroborating
evidence
of
his
claim
to
citizenship
except
the
birth
certificate.
he
later
admitted
that,
that
birth
certificate
belonged
to
someone
else.
at
the
third
hearing,
he
produced
three
witnesses,
all
relatives
who
supported
to
some
extent,
his
latest
accounts
of
his
birth.
the
account
they
supported
was
quite
different
from
the
two
previous
accounts
petitioner
himself
had
sworn
to.
again
no
documents
of
any
kind
were
presented.
the
case
is
here
because
a
federal
statute
provides
that
in
a
case
involving
a
claim
for
citizenship
and
after
exhausting
administrative
proceedings.
a
claimer
may
start
over
again
with
a
de
novo
trial
in
a
federal
district
court.
provided
two
conditions
on
that.
one,
that
the
claim
is
not
frivolous
and
two,
that
the
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
has
been
presented
by
claimants
evidence.
the
court
today
holds
that
petitioner
has
met
these
conditions
and
orders
a
judicial
trial
de
novo.
in
my
view
the
court
arrives
at
this
remarkable
result
through
a
series
of
errors.
first
it
ignores
entirely
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
claim
not
be
frivolous.
it
would
be
difficult
to
think
of
a
more
frivolous
claim
than
this
one.
next,
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
because
of
the
partial
support
of
petitioner's
current
story
by
his
three
relatives.
the
court
construes
the
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
language
in
the
immigration
statute,
in
the
same
way
that
this
language
is
construed
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
analogy
to
a
summary
judgment
is
totally
inappropriate.
unlike
a
party
opposing
a
summary
judgment
of
a
civil
trial,
petitioner
already
has
had
three
full
evidentiary
trials
before
immigration
judges
and
appeals
from
each
of
these.
but
even
if
the
court's
standard
were
not
erroneous,
there
can
be
a
no
genuine
issue
of
fact,
where
the
evidence
is
transparently
and
patently
false.
not
one
of
the
numerous
judges
who
have
heard
petitioner's
meandering
stories
to
believe
him.
the
judge
who
heard
the
three
relatives
testify
observed
that
they
had
been
coached
and
that,
that
stories
differed
in
many
respects
from
any
previous
story
told
by
petitioner.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
on
petitioner's
third
and
last
appeal
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record,
but
petitioner's
claim
to
citizenship
and
here
i
quote
“has
been
knowingly
false
since
it's
inception.”
despite
this
record
of
persistent
fabrication,
the
court
today
concludes
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
de
novo
trial
in
a
district
court.
all
that
has
occurred
during
the
past
eleven
years
is
prologue.
petitioner's
case
will
start
afresh
in
a
district
court
as
if
it
were
new
civil
litigation.
petitioner,
therefore
is
free
to
change
his
testimony
again
to
round
up
new
relatives
who
will
swear
it.
if
he
loses
once
more
as
is
completely
predictable,
he
will
have
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
from
there,
he
may
file
another
petition
for
certiorari.
this
additional
round
of
proceedings
could
take
several
years.
meanwhile,
petitioner
will
continue
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
living
in
america,
a
privilege
that
he
has
consistently
abused.
my
consent
and
what
prompts
me
to
speak
at
this
length
in
dissent,
is
not
so
much
that
this
petitioner
has
made
a
mockery
of
the
system
of
justice,
rather
is
that
this
court
has
construed
a
statute
in
a
way
that
invites
and
rewards
falsehood.
until
today's
decision,
no,
under
today's
decision,
every
person
who
is
subject
to
deportation
has
it
within
his
power
by
presenting
transparently
false
testimony
to
obtain
both
protracted,
administrative,
and
judicial
proceedings
extending
over
years.
the
court
today
has
opened
a
unique
and
inviting
door.

justice
rehnquist
joins
me

this
dissent.
