mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
requires
this
court
to
decide
whether
the
provision
of
a
comprehensive
statutory
program
designed
to
protect
the
public
and
to
encourage
the
development
of
nuclear
powered
electric
generating
facilities
by
providing
for
the
licensing
and
regulation
of
such
plans,
by
abolishing
defenses
and
extending
statutes
of
limitations,
by
providing
for
the
establishment
of
financial
protection
for
possible
public
liability
that
impose
a
limitation
of
liability
is
unconstitutional
as
repugnant
to
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed
and
it
was
presumptuous
to
state
it
so
categorically,
but
if
the
court
reaches
the
merits,
that
would
be
the
issue
that
the
court
would
address.
my
brother
has
discussed
the
grounds
set
forth
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
finding
that
this
provision
of
price-anderson
was
unconstitutional,
specifically
the
due
process
ground
and
the
equal
protection
ground
that
is
implied
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
that
was
not
relied
upon
by
the
district
court,
but
that
appellees
urge
in
their
response
at
pages
22-26
in
their
brief
that
this
limitation
of
liability
constitutes
a
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
first,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
protectable
property
here
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
there
is
perhaps
an
expectation
of
recovery
in
the
event
of
an
actionable
wrong
that
has
not
yet
occurred
and
may
not
occur.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
vested
right
of
recovery
in
something
as
supposititious
as
that
and
that
this
is
not
protectable
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
further,
we
submit
that
that
there
is
no
taking
here
by
the
enactment
of
the
price-anderson
legislation.
this
is
a
regulatory
measure
and
it
does
not
even
regulate
property
owned
by
appellees.
it
regulates
property
that
might
conceivably,
under
some
circumstances,
affect
property
owned
by
appellees.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
the
question
that
really
tests
the
rule.
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
under
which
it
could,
but
with
a
different
statutory
scheme.
for
example,
the
government
initially
had
a
monopoly
if
all
fissionable
material.
indeed,
the
statute
provided
that
possession
of
facilities
for
the
use
of
fissionable
material
and
possession
or
transportation
of
fissionable
fuel
was
a
crime.
i
suppose
if
the
government
had
kept
its
monopoly
and
had
built
these
plants
itself,
it
would
not
have
had
to
provide
for
compensation.
i
suppose,
then
the
compensation
would
be
obtained
by
anyone
injured
through
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
whether
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
mandated
by
the
constitution,
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed
and
if
the
court
please,
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
if
the
development
of
nuclear
powered
electrical
plants
remained
in
the
government,
i
think
there
is
a
way
where,
just
to
answer
the
court’s
question
which
as
i
had
said
i
think
goes
to
limit
in
testing
the
proposition
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would,
of
course
suppose
so
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not
understand
that
premise
to
have
been
implicitly
the
chief
justice’s
question,
but
i
certainly
agree
with
the
court.
if
the
federal
government
had
retained
its
monopoly
of
atomic
power,
that
certainly
could
have
resulted.
but
here,
there
is
a
regulation
of
property
not
owned
by
appellees
in
which
appellees
have
no
interest
and
so
again,
we
say
this
is
not
a
taking
in
addition
to
they
are
not
being
protectable
property.
finally,
although
appellees
do
not
make
this
argument
fully,
it
might
be
urged
that
if
their
property
was
taken
or
they
were
deprived
of
substantial
enjoinment
of
it
by
the
action
of
a
regulated
utility
that
that
might
constitute
a
taking.
this
court
has
suggested
that
the
taking
of
private
property
by
a
state-regulated
facility
is
not
a
taking
by
the
state,
and
therefore,
we
think
this
argument
that
the
district
court
did
not
make
in
support
of
its
judgment,
but
that
appellees
make
in
their
brief
also
must
fail
as
their
argument
related
to
due
process.
my
brother
spoke
about
the
matter
of
whether
there
was
an
adequate
quid
pro
quo
and
he
was
asked
to
suppose
that
a
quid
pro
quo
is
required
by
due
process.
if
a
remedy
is
to
be
abolished
or
altered,
we
submit
that
this
court
has
never
stated
that
a
quid
pro
quo
must
be
provided,
but
that
in
the
event
it
is
required,
that
the
congress
by
providing
for
$560
million
that
are
immediately
available
to
enable
anyone
of
these
licensees
to
respond
in
damages
for
injury
to
person
or
property
is
more
than
an
adequate
quid
pro
quo
for
the
limitation
that
is
placed
upon
a
common
law
remedy
here.
we
also
suggest
that
there
is
more
than
just
the
$560
million
of
course.
there
are
venue
requirements
that
are
advantageous.
in
partial
response
to
the
question
put
to
my
brother
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
not
a
preemption
of
state
law
by
this
litigation,
but
there
is
a
grant
of
original,
not
exclusive
but
original
jurisdiction,
in
the
district
court
to
hear
actions
arising
out
of
incidence.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
my
understanding
from
my
reading.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
the
case
is
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
whatever
court
it
is
filed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
think
very
much
like
fela,
if
the
court
please
and
this
grant
of
original,
but
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
coupled
with
a
grant
of
venue
in
a
district
in
which
the
incident
occurred
or
in
the
case
of
an
overseas
incident
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
also
interestingly
provides
for
removal
by
any
person
from
any
other
court
to
the
appropriate
district
court,
that
is
to
say,
the
united
states
district
in
which
the
incident
occurred
or
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
there,
again,
is
something
else
that
is
given
if
a
quid
pro
quo
is
required
for
whatever
limitation
has
been
imposed.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
requirement,
however,
of
a
quid
pro
quo
and
if
there
is,
in
a
situation
like
this,
its
value
cannot
be
calculated
precisely
to
permit
us
to
determine
its
adequacy.
we
submit,
in
short,
that
the
question
here
is
whether
this
is
a
rational
legislative
means
of
removing
a
significant
obstacle
to
the
achievement
of
a
valid
federal
governmental
purpose.
we
believe
that
it
is
and
we
believe
that
this
is
the
test
by
which
it
should
be
measured
and
as
such
that
it
should
be
found
constitutional.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
certainly
that
is
one
source
constitutional
of
power,
i
would
think.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes
and
if
memory
serves
and
i
may
not
be
correct
on
this
and
i
would
like
the
privilege
of
correcting
it
if
i
am
in
error,
but
i
am
thinking
of
the
tva
legislation.
i
think
this
was
partly
under
the
war
powers,
if
i
am
not
mistaken.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
so
certain
about
that.
if
energy
is
necessary
for
national
defense
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
encourage
the
creation
of
energy,
i
suppose
that
is
the
way
i
would
make
the
argument.
i
suspect,
if
i
am
correct
about
the
tva
and
when
the
muscle
shoals
dam
was
built,
but
i
would
like
to
look
at
that
legislation
and
correct
it
if
i
have
misinformed
the
court
about
it.
i
had
frankly,
not
thought
of
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
understand
appellees’
argument,
it
is
not
so
much
what
congress
did.
it
is
that
it
did
not
do
enough.
i
think
appellees
would
say
that
there
is
some
point
at
which
congress
might
impose
a
cap
on
liability
that
was
sufficient
to
take
care
of
any
anticipated
harm.
i
think
the
difficulty
there
proves
the
wisdom
of
the
rule
that
requires
the
court
to
uphold
a
rational
legislative
means
of
achieving
a
valid
governmental
policy,
we
are
in
a
new
area.
nobody
really
knows
what
is
going
to
happen
to
this
atomic
genie
that
is
out
of
the
bottle
and
the
congress
must
necessarily
be
given
latitude
to
experiment
in
ways
of
controlling
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
either.
i
misunderstood
the
court
if
my
answer
was
not
responsive.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
have
difficulty
with
the
proposition.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
would
be
very
close
to
the
steel
mill’s
case.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
suppose
if
it
did
that,
it
would
be
required
to
afford
compensation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
just
taking
and
the
utilities
that
have
expended
large
sums
of
money
would
be
entitled
to
compensation.
the
argument
i
was
endeavoring
to
make
about
the
rationality
of
this
plan
in
a
field
about
which
no
one
really
knows
anything
is
illustrated
somewhat
by
some
of
the
dollars
involved
here.
when
the
limitation
was
first
provided
and
the
limitation
has
three
elements,
the
licensed
plant
must
acquire
the
maximum
amount
of
liability
insurance
available
from
private
sources,
then
there
is
a
secondary
liability
pool
with
a
$5-million
retroactive
premium
to
be
paid
by
every
licensed
facility
and
the
balance
of
liability
up
to
$560
million
is
to
be
taken
up
by
the
government.
when
this
was
first
started,
the
maximum
amount
of
liability
insurance
available
from
private
sources
was
$60
million.
now,
it
is
$140
million
because
the
insurance
industry
in
the
light
of
its
experience
of
no
accidents
of
the
magnitude
that
concerns
appellees,
also
the
retroactive
premium
pool
has
grown
to
$315
million.
so
currently,
there
are
455
million
private
dollars
available
for
compensation
under
this
plan.
the
government’s
guarantee
of
the
difference
up
to
$560
million
is
only
$105
million
and
it
is
projected
that
the
government’s
guarantee
might
be
extinguished
in
1980
and
there
is
a
further
projection
that
by
1985
there
will
be
$1
billion
of
private
insurance
as
if
the
same
trend
continues
and
the
same
experience
obtained.
we
submit
that
this
proves
the
wisdom
of
the
rule
annunciated
by
this
court
of
allowing
the
congress
a
freedom
to
use
its
judgment
as
long
as
it
is
rationally
informed
to
achieve
legitimate
governmental
ends.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
could
the
congress
have
required
them
to
do
it?
i
suspect
not.
that
gets
close
to
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
can
be
required
to
do
something
he
does
not
want
to
do.
we
encourage
them
by
tax
considerations.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
subsidies,
but
i
do
not
believe
they
could
require
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was
a
partnership
between
the
congress
and
the
utilities
community
for
the
private
development
of
nuclear
fueled
electric
generating
facilities
with
strict
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
not
much
has
been
said
about
these
other
provisions
and
if
the
court
please,
one
thing
that
disturbed
me
a
great
deal
about
appellees’
brief
was
a
suggestion
and
by
the
judgment
below
was
that
this
was
an
invitation
to
irresponsibility.
before
any
plant
can
be
constructed,
it
must
have
a
construction
license
and
the
construction
license
is
issued
only
after
a
very
careful
investigation,
making
certain
that
the
very
latest
techniques
are
employed,
but
the
construction
license
does
not
permit
it
to
operate.
after
the
plant
is
constructed,
another
inspection
or
a
series
of
inspections
occur
before
an
operation
license
is
issued.
an
operation
license
is
not
issued
in
either
of
these
cases.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
enrico
thermal
plant,
yes
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
prefer
not
to
answer
it
without
being
certain
of
the
dates.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
price-anderson
began
in
1957.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
that
was
the
question,
but
i
would
like
to
be
more
certain
in
responding.
if
the
court
please
then
the
government
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
