mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
flaw
in
appellees’
argument
is
that
they
view
the
price-anderson
act
as
simply
another
regulatory
statute
and
argue
that
it
is
analogous
to
government
regulation
of
such
activities
as
mining
or
that
it
is
analogous
to
government-imposed
rent
control.
however,
a
careful
examination
of
the
act
shows
that
it
is
not
simply
another
regulatory
statute
and
that
it
has
four
features
which
distinguish
it
from
other
limitations
on
liability.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
i
was
and
i
will
address
it
right
now
if
you
would
like.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
with
your
permission,
i
will
discuss
the
statute
and
then
address
standing
before
i
reach
the
merits.
in
fact,
and
this
is
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
stress
in
my
discussion
of
the
statute,
the
price-anderson
act
is
a
unique
action
by
congress
which
severely
and
arbitrarily
limits
recovery
available
to
victims
of
a
nuclear
accident.
rather
than
involving
a
regulation
of
a
business
such
as
duke
power
company,
the
price-anderson
act
creates
a
situation
which
could
deprive
persons
of
their
homes
and
cause
them
serious
health
injuries
while
simultaneously
precluding
them
from
resorting
to
their
state
law
remedies.
the
thrust
of
the
act
is
two-fold.
first,
it
creates
a
pot
of
money,
$560
million,
to
cover
damages
arising
out
of
a
nuclear
accident.
second,
it
limits
all
liability
of
all
possibly
responsible
parties
to
that
pot
of
money.
to
explain
how
the
statute
would
operate
and
this
is
important
to
the
ultimate
fairness
and
adequacy
of
the
remedy,
i
would
like
to
use
an
example
of
a
hypothetical
victim
and
look
at
the
statute
and
ask
two
questions.
how
much
would
that
victim
receive
in
the
event
of
an
accident
and
what
are
the
chances
that
that
hypothetical
victim
would
be
compensated?
for
the
purposes
of
the
example,
i
will
assume
that
the
victim
sustains
$1,000
in
property
damage
or
personal
injury.
first,
let
us
look
at
how
much
money
the
victim
would
recover.
if
the
accident
causes
$560
million
in
damage
or
less,
then
the
victim
would
recover
$1,000.
this
is
an
example
of
an
accident
where
the
limitation
on
liability
would
not
come
into
play
and
if
all
accidents
were
under
$560
million,
the
limitation
on
liability
would
not
be
necessary.
in
fact,
this
case
would
not
be
necessary.
however,
for
a
major
accident,
when
exceeding
$560
million,
the
victim
share
becomes
proportionately
smaller.
so
that
in
the
event
of
an
accident
causing
$1
billion
in
damage,
his
share
is
half
or
$500.
if
the
accident
causes
$60
billion
in
damage,
then
his
share
would
be
$10
or
less
than
a
1%
recovery
for
the
damages
incurred.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
in
that
situation,
in
the
event
of
an
accident,
there
would
be
a
taking.
no
one
could
force
the
government
to
actually
pay
the
money,
but
there
would
be
a
taking
without
just
compensation
and
the
constitution
would
place
the
same
obligation
on
the
federal
government.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
even
under
the
taking
clause
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
do
not
know
that
anyone
did
make
that
case.
i
am
aware
of
no
cases
which
say
that
they
were
prohibited.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
under
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
but
the
decision
was
not
on
the
taking
issue.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
facts
of
that
case.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
argument
for
a
taking
here
would
be
much
stronger
than
it
would
in
that
case
because
here
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
government
negligence,
it
is
a
matter
of
government
promotion,
regulation
and
licensing
of
nuclear
power
and
the
most
important
difference
is
the
limitation
of
liability
in
the
price-anderson
act.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
on
our
taking
argument,
assuming
that
the
government
were
building
and
operating
nuclear
power
plants
or
looking
at
this
case,
we
are
not
arguing
that
simply
because
the
government
is
a
factor
in
damage
that
it
is
a
taking
every
time,
but
in
a
situation
where
the
government
passes
the
limitation
on
liability
in
the
price-anderson
act
which
was
a
precondition
to
nuclear
power,
then
there
the
government
involvement
is
much
more
substantial
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
it
is
not
dissimilar
from
two
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
the
first
of
those
is
richards
v.
washington
terminal
company.
there
the
government
passed
a
statute
authorizing
a
railroad
company
to
build
a
railroad
through
the
city
of
washington.
the
statute
also
had
the
effect
of
nullifying
the
state
or
the
district
of
columbia
nuisance
laws
of
protecting
the
railroad
from
those
actions.
in
that
case,
the
railroad
built
the
railroad,
it
built
a
tunnel,
mr.
richards
was
a
nearby
property
owner.
he
was
unhappy
because
the
soot
and
smoke
from
the
railroad
tunnel
came
onto
his
property
and
depreciated
its
value.
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
taking
there.
in
other
words,
even
though
congress
did
not
actually
build
a
railroad
just
as
congress
has
not
built
nuclear
power
plants,
what
it
did
in
authorizing
the
railroad
and
most
important
in
immunizing
the
railroad
company
from
nuisance
actions
is
precisely
analogous,
i
submit,
to
what
has
happened
here
where
the
government
has
immunized
duke
power
company
from
nuisance
actions
or
from
any
actions
by
persons
injured
from
a
nuclear
accident.
i
would
submit
that
griggs
v.
allegheny
county
is
also
similar.
there,
the
court
held
there
to
be
a
taking
when
a
private
airplane
caused
damage
from
noise
to
private
property
and
the
court
held
there
to
be
a
taking
because
the
airport
was
owned
by
the
county
and
the
county’s
involvement
in
building
the
airport
and
marketing
the
routes
for
the
airline
was
sufficient
government
involvement
for
there
to
be
a
taking.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
return
to
my
example
of
the
hypothetical
victim
and
i
want
to
look
at
what
the
recovery
would
be
to
a
victim
in
the
event
of
an
accident.
i
had
just
described
the
extremely
minimal
recovery
in
a
case
of
a
$60-billion
accident.
while
$60
billion
may
sound
like
an
incredibly
high
figure,
but
it
is
not
unrealistic
in
light
of
the
most
recent
government
study
on
this
subject,
that
study
which
had
been
referred
to
previously,
the
reactor
safety
study.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
it
is
more
than
duke
power
has.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
we
did
not
have
the
limitation
on
liability,
we
would
not
have
nuclear
power.
if
we
did
not
have
the
limitation,
we
could
not
have
these
accidents.
while
$60
billion
is
more
than
duke
power
has,
$560
million
is
very
close
to
what
duke
power
has.
if
the
point
is
that
it
is
well
off
under
the
act,
i
submit
that
in
the
event
of
an
accident
victims
could
sue
not
only
duke,
but
they
could
sue
the
manufacturer
of
the
reactor,
which
in
this
case
is
westinghouse
and
in
all
cases
is
a
corporation
with
billions
of
dollars
in
assets.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
limitation
on
liability
is
necessary.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
is
necessary
for
nuclear
power,
but
it
is
not
the
only
alternative
for
promoting
nuclear
power.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
if
i
said
it
that
way,
i
was
not
as
precise
as
i
might
have
been.
the
limitation
on
liability,
and
you
can
see
this
in
the
briefs
of
the
industry,
in
this
case
in
the
government’s
briefs,
in
the
district
court’s
findings,
the
limitation
in
1957
was
a
preconditioned
to
nuclear
power
and
some
system
today
would
be
necessary.
some
system
to
protect
these
companies
from
this
potentially
huge
liability
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
have
additional
nuclear
power
plants
built,
but
the
system
does
not
have
to
be
the
system
in
the
price-anderson
act.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
is
true
that
my
clients
are
opposed
to
nuclear
power
and
they
are
opposed
to
the
price-anderson
act.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
they
are
opposed
to
both.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
our
basic
objective
is
to
get
a
system
where
our
clients
would
receive
full
compensation
in
the
event
of
a
nuclear
accident.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
question,
i
think
your
question
is
a
response
to
that
question.
one
alternative
system
would
be
for
the
government
to
assume
this
liability.
another
alternative
would
be
to
have
a
system
which
spreads
it
among
the
industry
so
that
each
company
which
owns
reactors
would
be
required
to
pay
$50
or
$100
million
to
the
victims
of
a
disaster
of
this
nature.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
there
would
be
no
problem
about
the
constitutionality
of
it,
but
if
there
were
an
accident,
i
would
submit
that
victims
of
such
an
accident
could
sue
the
government
for
just
compensation.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
excuse
me.
they
could
only
sue
for
their
property
damage.
we
are
not
arguing
that
they
could
sue
for
anything
other
than
their
property
damage,
but
in
that
situation
victims
who
incurred
property
damage
could
sue
the
government
for
just
compensation.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
if
the
government
specifically
provided
that
it
would
not
pay.
i
am
not
certain
that
there
is
anything
victims
could
do
to
make
the
government
actually
pay
out
the
money,
but
nevertheless,
i
would
submit
that
they
would
have
a
constitutional
claim.
for
example,
if
the
government
specifically
withdrew
the
tucker
act
remedy
for
these
individuals
or
for
any
individuals,
then
there
would
be
no
recourse
that
they
would
have.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
that
is
so.
i
think
the
interest
of
federalism
and
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
require
that
if
the
government
chooses
to
withdraw
a
state
tort
remedy,
if
the
federal
government
chooses
to
withdraw
a
state
tort
remedy,
particularly
when
it
is
simultaneously
encouraging
the
activity
which
would
cause
the
damage
that
it
is
required
under
the
due
process
clause
to
provide
some
adequate
remedy.
in
the
workman’s
compensation
cases,
this
court
went
through
the
analysis,
it
looked
at
the
legislative
judgment
and
it
determined
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedy.
here,
congress
did
not
even
pretend
to
make
a
legislative
judgment.
senator
anderson,
for
whom
the
bill
is
named,
claimed
authorship
of
the
$560-million
figure
which
limits
all
liability
and
he
testified
in
1957
that
he
literally
picked
that
figure
out
of
the
air.
in
his
words,
he
chose
it
as
a
figure
that
would
not
scare
the
country
to
death.
representative
holyfield,
also
a
charter
member
of
the
atomic
energy
committee,
testified
in
1975
that
he
recognized
and
everyone
recognized
that
the
figure
of
$560
million
was
an
arbitrary
figure.
there
is
no
legislative
judgment
here
that
$560
million
would
be
adequate
in
the
event
of
an
accident.
one
alternative
to
congress
would
be
to
make
that
legislative
judgment
and
adequately
provide
in
any
number
of
ways
for
the
victims
of
such
an
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
it
represents
a
rough
determination
and
the
schedules
for
workman’s
compensation
increase
as
the
severity
of
the
injury
increases.
i
think
it
does
represent
a
rough
judgment.
the
legislature
makes
that
judgment
and
in
the
cases
of
this
court,
even
where
the
legislature
has
made
a
judgment
which
i
submit
it
did
not
make
here,
the
court
has
looked
at
that
judgment
to
see
if
there
is
a
fair
exchange,
to
see
if
the
remedy
provided
is
adequate.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
in
those
cases
and
in
the
case
of
almost
every
tort
statute
that
the
legislature
passes,
it
is
looking
at
the
law
and
adjusting
the
remedies
with
the
eye
to
providing
a
fair
system
of
compensation
for
the
victims
of
the
remedy
and
a
fair
way
of
distributing
the
loss
and
i
submit
that
that
was
what
was
involved
there.
the
legislature
determined
that
the
remedy
was
being
abused
and
that
it
just
was
too
inefficient
to
provide
this
remedy.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
guess
the
primary
difference
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
legislature
does,
you
are
going
to
have
libels
and
you
are
going
to
have
injuries
caused
by
negligence
and
so
on.
but
here,
the
legislative
action
was
a
necessary
precondition
to
the
injuries.
here,
without
any
legislative
action,
you
could
have
no
injuries
from
a
nuclear
power
plant.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
libel
law
either
way
has
very
little
effect
on
what
people
say
unless
it
has
very
little
effect
on
the
injuries,
just
as
i
think
a
law
making
it
illegal
to
commit
an
assault.
if
anything,
it
deters
assaults,
but
none
of
those
legislative
actions
actually
encourage
assaults
or
encourage
libels.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
would
think
it
does.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is,
in
most
cases,
the
existence
of
these
remedies
has
a
deterrent
effect.
here,
the
legislative
action
had
just
the
opposite
effect.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
those
actions
i
see
as
being
parallel
to
the
workman’s
compensation
statutes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
they
do.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
they
do,
but
the
ones
that
i
am
familiar
with
provide
for
recovery
of
the
limits
of
$500,000
or
$200,000,
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
there
is
a
limit
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
any
limit
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
point
is
that,
in
those
cases,
the
recovery
provided
is
substantial.
it
is
not
dependent
on
the
total
injuries
to
all
victims
of
the
accident
as
it
is
here.
moreover
in
every
other
case,
and
i
believe
it
would
include
certain
libel
injuries
also,
victims
can
purchase
insurance
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
if
it
does
not,
the
statutes
i
have
seen
are
constitutional.
a
limit
to
zero,
which
i
submit,
is
not
far
from
what
happened
here
would
raise
serious
questions.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
here,
i
think
that
at
a
minimum
the
legislature
is
required
to
make
a
judgment
that
the
money
provided
is
substantial.
moreover,
in
the
medical
malpractice
analogy,
at
least
the
victims
have
the
option
to
buy
insurance,
at
least
it
is
a
consensual
relationship.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
to
doctors,
but
to
patients
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
availability
of
insurance
to
patients.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
i
have
heard
of
those,
but
as
far
as
the
patient
is
concerned
and
it
is
the
patient
who
is
analogous
to
the
victim
to
a
nuclear
accident,
there
is
limitation
on
availability
of
insurance
to
a
patient.
it
is
a
consensual
relationship
if
the
patient
chooses
to
go
to
the
doctor.
moreover,
those
are
all
state
statutes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
could
not.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
because
every
home
insurance
policy
contains
an
exclusion,
excluding
radiation
caused
by
a
nuclear
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
in
the
price-anderson
act,
the
scheme
of
providing
this
$560
million
in
insurance
requires
the
utilities
to
purchase
the
maximum
insurance
available.
the
insurance
industry
has
given
that
as
its
reason
why
it
is
unwilling
to
sell
insurance
to
home
owners
or
any
property
owner.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
question
is
would
that
be
constitutional?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no
single
person?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
total
damages
would
be?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
if
that
statute
did
not
have
the
precise
purpose
in
effect
of
promoting
nuclear
power
or
a
catastrophe
that
would
cause
damages
many
times
the
limitation,
then
i
think
it
probably
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
depends
on
whether
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
legislation
is
to
promote
an
activity
which
as
is
recognized
can
cause
injuries
many
times
in
excess
of
that
figure.
if
it
does
not
promote
such
an
activity,
then
you
have
a
completely
different
case
from
this
case.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
pass
this
bill
in
1910?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
you
would
still
have
a
taking
there,
but
it
is
such
a
different
case.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
i
apologize.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
each
case
and
look
to
see
how
involved
the
government’s
role
is
in
the
accident.
it
is
simply
difficult
to
answer
the
question
without
knowing
whether
the
government’s
role
is
critical
to
the
injuries
to
the
victims
of
the
accident.
to
keep
my
commitment
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
suppose
i
better
address
rightness
and
standing.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
that
that
patient
was
just
with
some
injury.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
he
lives
across
the
street.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
he
is
in
perfect
health,
but
he
does
not
like
having
a
doctor
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
would
not
matter
whether
it
would
be
a
doctor
or
a
nuclear
power
plant.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
that
individual
would
show
some
small
injury
and
would
show
a
connection
between
the
injury
and
the
act.
the
question
would
be
whether
and
i
submit
there
would
not
be
in
the
case
and
there
are
here,
are
there
prudential
considerations
which
make
it
important
to
decide
the
case
and
which
should
impel
the
court
to
reach
the
issue.
in
other
words,
at
a
very
basic
matter,
the
issue
of
standing
is
a
question
of
whether
you
have
shown
some
injury
and
it
can
be
very
small.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
court
would
have
the
power,
yes,
but
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
should
decide
that
question
in
that
case.
here,
the
prudential
considerations
strongly
militate
towards
reaching
the
merits,
as
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
stated
in
its
brief.
the
primary
prudential
consideration
here
is
that
the
worst
time
for
a
reasoned
decision
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
price-anderson
act
would
be
after
a
nuclear
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
there
are
two
questions
there.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
can
you
give
me
one?
mr.
william
b.
schultz
because
we
would
know
the
size
of
the
particular
incident,
but
the
problem
is
that
most
of
the
damages
here
are
health
injuries
that
the
government
study
showed
that
as
many
as
40-some
thousand
people
could
die
from
cancer,
but
they
would
not
actually
incur
that
cancer
for
10-40
years
after
the
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
am
trying
to
say
that
we
would
not
know
the
size
of
the
injuries
after
an
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
we
would
have
somewhat
more
knowledge
after
the
accident.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
think
that
is
when
we
are
looking
at
prudential
considerations,
that
is
on
the
side
of
waiting.
that
one
is,
but
i
think
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
immense
pressure
on
the
court
to
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
we
are
not
guaranteed,
the
court
would
invalidate
the
limitation.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
but
here,
if
the
court
invalidates
the
limitations,
the
likelihood
is
that
congress
will
enact
further
legislation
to
provide
substantial
recovery
for
the
victims.
so
if
we
get
the
issue
decided
now,
the
industry
will
know
where
it
stands,
the
plaintiffs
will
know
where
they
stand
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
often
thought
that
it
is
certainly
in
the
industry’s
interest
to
have
the
merits
of
this
case
decided.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
also
think
it
is
in
our
client’s
interests
to
have
the
court
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
then
either
this
nuclear
plant
will
not
be
completed
or
congress
will
act
and
provide
a
system
of
full
compensation.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
either
the
plants
will
not
be
operated
or
if
they
are
operated,
it
will
be
under
a
system
that
provides
the
plaintiffs
substantial
compensation.
so
they
will
be
better
off
that
way.
in
the
alternative,
either
they
will
be
better
off
because
there
were
no
environmental
injuries.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
a
theory
on
the
environmental
injuries
as
a
matter
of
injuries,
i
think,
yes.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
of
the
particular
owner.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
claimant
would
have
two
protections.
the
first
would
be
the
state
tort
laws
would
have
deterred
the
construction
of
the
nuclear
power
plant,
so
that
without
this
limitation
on
liabilities
the
state
tort
laws
would
have
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
with
the
understanding
that
that
part
of
the
hypothetical
is
inconsistent
with
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
but
the
judge
below
and
congress
found
that
the
limitation
on
liability
was
a
necessary
precondition.
this
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
the
vice
president
of
general
electric
which
was
one
of
the
two
major
manufacturers
of
nuclear
reactors
came
to
congress
in
1957
and
testified
that
even
though
his
company
was
in
the
middle
of
constructing
the
first
reactor,
that
unless
congress
acted
to
limit
the
liability,
his
company
would
simply
walk
away
from
its
project
and
not
make
the
investment.
but
mr.
chief
justice,
the
second
part
of
the
answer
is
that
the
victim
could
sue
the
manufacturer
of
the
reactor
which,
here,
is
westinghouse
which
is
a
company
that
would
have
suffered
no
loss
and
would
have
billions
of
dollars
in
assets.
the
price-anderson
act
takes
away
not
only
the
victim’s
right
to
sue
duke,
but
also
the
right
to
sue
the
manufacturer
or
any
other
responsible
party.
moreover,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
under
the
price-anderson
act
it
may
be
as
much
as
20
years
before
these
victims
would
receive
any
recovery.
this
is
because
the
act
requires
that
before
any
compensation
beyond
a
small
amount
of
emergency
funds
may
be
paid
out,
a
district
court
judge
must
come
up
with
a
plan
of
distribution
to
provide
for
the
late
claimants,
these
are
the
health
injuries
that
would
not
appear
for
10-20
years
after
the
accident.
if
you
do
not
know
what
those
injuries
are
going
to
be,
it
may
be
simply
impossible
to
pay
the
early
claimants
until
you
know
what
the
injuries
of
all
the
claimants
are.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
point
you
made
earlier
in
the
argument
is
critical
and
that
is
if
congress
had
the
power
to
promote
nuclear
power
by
limiting
the
liability
to
$560
million,
then
that
argument
would
lead
to
the
proposition
that
it
would
have
had
the
power
to
limit
the
liability
to
$0.
in
fact,
it
would
lead
to
the
proposition
that
the
federal
congress
could
eliminate
all
state
law
remedies
for
torts.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that
would
be,
i
think,
precisely
the
same
as
the
effect
of
the
price-anderson
act.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no.
that
is
what
the
corporations
would
say.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
but
to
say
that
a
nuclear
industry
may
convey,
to
encourage
them
to
convey
their
reactors
to
corporations
so
that
they
can
escape
liability
and
to
do
that
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
no,
but
i
submit
that
the
remedy
provided
by
the
corporate
limitation
statutes,
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
whole,
is
a
substantial
remedy.
in
most
case
victims
are
able
to
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
it
is
per
client
--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
if
there
were
three
accidents,
it
is
unclear
what
would
happen,
but
for
the
first
two
anyway,
in
a
year
it
is
per
incident.
if
you
look
at
the
corporate
limit
as
a
whole
and
look
at
its
fairness,
not
to
just
a
particular
individual,
but
to
the
group
of
victims
that
would
be
injured,
that
could
be
injured
by
the
corporation.
most
of
those
victims
are
going
to
be
able
to
recover.
if
the
corporation
is
specifically
organized
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
liability,
they
have
the
option
of
piercing
the
corporate
veil
and
because
of
that,
and
i
think
this
brings
us
back
around,
the
nuclear
industry
here
on
its
own
could
do
this.
it
could
simply
incorporate
each
nuclear
reactor
and
limit
its
liability
that
way.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
but
it
is
not
willing
to
take
the
risk.
this
comes
back
around
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
action
here,
the
limitation
on
liability,
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
construction
in
these
nuclear
reactors.
even
though
the
particular
system
chosen
here
is
not
necessary,
there
are
other
ways
that
the
federal
government
could
do
this
and
substantially
provide
for
state
citizens.
the
fact
remains
that
the
limitation
here
is
necessary
for
the
construction
of
nuclear
reactors.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
thank
you.
