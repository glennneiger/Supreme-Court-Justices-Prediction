justice
john
paul
stevens
general,
do
you
mean
that
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
also
mean
that
the
statute
does
not
make
the
case
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
whatever
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schultz,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory.
presume
our
coal
mines
run
out
and
the
oil
wells
run
dry
and
the
only
major
source
of
energy
is
atomic
power.
assume
further
that
we
cannot
have
atomic
power
plants
without
a
limitation
of
a
liability
statute.
would
you
still
say
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
pass
such
a
statute
and
make
that
source
of
power
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
told
us
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
other
alternative
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
our
changing,
mr.
schultz,
does
the
existence
of
a
libel
remedy
not
exercise
some
kind
of
deterrent
effect
on
newspapers
in
what
they
say,
i
always
thought
it
did,
that
element?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schultz,
i
understand
one
of
your
theories
of
standing
that
seem
to
me
to
have
some
possible
merit
is
that
the
district
judge
found
present
injury
in
fact,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
granted
there
is
no
nexus
to
use
noble
word,
where
between
that
injury
and
a
price-anderson
act,
but
there
is
a
nexus
between
your
basic
objective.
the
court
also
found
that
if
you
win,
these
plants
will
not
be
completed
and
will
not
operate,
and
therefore,
the
present
injury
would
be
relieved,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schultz,
on
that
very
question,
the
corporate
device
itself
is
a
method
of
limiting
liability
that
promotes
capital
investment
and
the
like.
supposing
we
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
congress
passed
a
new
statute
and
said
that
the
power
company
convey
the
plant
assets
into
a
separate
corporation
whose
liability
shall
be
limited
to
its
own
assets
and
there
shall
be
no
piercing
of
corporate
veil
or
anything
like
that.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
the
corporation
shall
not
be
liable
for
anything
over
and
above
its
own
net
worth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
that
a
corporationâ€™s
liability
is
limited
to
its
net
worth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
engaged
in
hazardous
occupations
and
enterprises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
can
limit
liability
just
like
every
other
corporation
does.
new
york
central
has
a
lot
of
people
that
is
hurt,
it
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
pay
them
100
cents
on
the
dollar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
$560
million
times
the
number
of
nuclear
plants
is
a
lot
of
money
too.
i
take
it
that
it
is
per
incident,
is
it
not,
not
just
560
nationwide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
per
client?
