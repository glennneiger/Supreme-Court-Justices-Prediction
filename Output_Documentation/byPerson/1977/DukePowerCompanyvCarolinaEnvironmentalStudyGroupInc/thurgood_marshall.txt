can
this
define
(inaudible)
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
not
really
answer
my
brother,
rehnquist’s,
question
as
indicated
by
my
brother
marshall.
just
to
a
statement
his
question
was
whether
a
statement
of
good
intentions
to
consider
this
whole
thing
in
the
event
of
a
catastrophe
would
be
enough
of
a
quid
pro
quo,
assuming
that
a
quid
pro
quo
is
constitutionally
required
and
you
said
congressional
action
would
be,
but
that
was
not
his
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
had
more
than
duke
power
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
just
had
nobody
else,
it
would
be
just
duke
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
sue
us
too
on
the
merits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
schultz,
let
me
try
another
one.
suppose
north
carolina
passed
a
law
that
said
that
in
its
state
courts,
in
any
major
catastrophe,
no
single
person
would
be
subject
to
more
than
$560
million
in
damages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
total.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
any
single
catastrophe.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
take
it
to
the
next
step.
could
the
federal
government
say
“dear
state
of
north
carolina,
we
will
pick
that
tab
up,
the
$560
million
tab”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
what
i
have
told
you.
that
is
all
you
have.
if
north
carolina
passed
this
bill
in
1910,
would
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
north
carolina
said
in
1910
that
no
single
catastrophe
should
subject
anybody
to
more
than
$560-million
worth
of
damages.
would
that
be
okay?
congress
in
1911
said
“we
will
pick
up
the
tab,”
any
utility
that
incur
a
$560
million,
we
are
going
to
pay
it?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
something
that
cost
you
$560
million.
you
would
take
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
invalidate
the
limitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
will
stomp
the
building
of
atomic
energy
plants,
which
is
what
you
want?
