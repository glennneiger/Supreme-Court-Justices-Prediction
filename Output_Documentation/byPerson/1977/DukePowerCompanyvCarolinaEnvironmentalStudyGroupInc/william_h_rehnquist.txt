justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griffith,
did
the
price-anderson
act
supersede
all
state
law
governing
recoverability
of
damages
in
this
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
under
north
carolina
law,
if
an
atomic
plant
blew
up,
it
would
have
not
taken
a
special
north
carolina
statute
to
permit
recovery
for
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
price-anderson
act
in
effect
preempt
state
damage
remedies
in
the
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
it
would
not
have
materially
advance
the
purpose
that
you
say
was
intended
to
serve,
if
it
simply
provided
for
a
limitation
of
liability
and
diversity
actions
in
federal
district
courts,
but
place
no
limitation
of
liability
on
state
courts,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
doing
that,
does
it
not
have
to
preempt
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
needs
a
carefully
tuned-balancing
of
competing
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
for
the
nine
of
us
to
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
it
comes
to
the
fine-tuning
test,
then
it
is
our
decision
rather
than
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
a
quid
pro
quo
were
under
the
constitutional
law
required
in
order
to
limit
liability
in
this
way,
would
you
say
that
if
all
congress
had
done
was
to
say
“we
will
take
a
careful
look
at
this
situation”
after
a
catastrophic
accident
occurs
would
be
enough?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
will
never
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
in
effect
goes
to
standing
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
when
you
say
that
this
appeal
requires
this
court
to
decide
the
question
i
take
it
that
is
on
the
assumption
that
we
adopt
your
view
of
standing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
hard
to
justify
this
statute
today
under
the
war
powers,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schultz,
are
you
going
to
address
the
standing
questions
sometime
during
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
you
have
45
minutes
to
spend
as
you
chose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
texas
city
disaster
case
where
the
government
was
claimed
to
be
liable
for
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
in
damage,
the
majority
of
the
court
held
that
it
was
within
the
discretionary
exception,
the
government
was
not
liable
for
anything,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
answer
is
inconsistent
to
justice
steven’s
question,
is
it
not?
you
say
it
is
necessary
to
have
this
in
order
to
promote
nuclear
power
and
yet
you
are
saying
it
is
not
the
only
alternative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
the
same
inadequacy
in
legislative
judgments
in
state
workman’s
compensation
acts
where
you
have
$60
a
week
for
loss
of
three
fingers
for
the
rest
of
your
life
and
that
sort
of
thing?
do
you
think
that
necessarily
represents
a
very
particular
determination
that
that
is
just
what
the
loss
of
three
fingers
is
worth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
your
position
then,
you
are
probably
too
young
to
remember
this,
but
in
the
late
30s
and
early
40s
a
number
of
states
had
actions
for
alienation
of
affections,
breach
of
promise
of
marriage,
seduction
and
a
number
of
civil
legislatures
simply
repealed
those
actions
by
legislative
act,
feeling
they
were
being
abused.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
they
would
have
to
provide
an
alternative
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
case
different
from
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
state
tomorrow
decides
that
an
action
for
libel
just
threatens
first
amendment
interest
so
much
that
we
are
not
going
to
allow
a
libel
action
in
the
state
anymore,
is
that
constitutional
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
differ
from
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
newspapers
went
to
the
legislatures
and
said
“unless
you
abolish
libel
laws,
we
will
not
be
able
to
publish
anymore.
we
are
getting
stuck
with
so
many
libel
judgments.”
would
that
change
your
answer
to
the
question
about
a
state
abolition
of
libel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
a
bunch
of
newspapers
in
the
state,
in
fact,
went
out
of
business,
i
think
there
will
probably
a
lot
fewer
libels,
would
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
your
clients
not
take
out
insurance
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
nothing
that
government
has
done
that
prevents
them
from
taking
out
insurance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
keep
your
commitment
to
me
if
you
will
answer
a
question
which
i
am
about
to
pose
to
you.
it
is
in
connection
with
the
malpractice
cases.
supposing
that
a
doctor’s
office
is
located
across
the
street
from
your
client’s
house
and
your
client
thinks
it
is
in
violation
of
the
zoning
laws.
can
he
come
into
a
federal
court
and
claim
that
the
state’s
malpractice
limitation
law
is
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
that
if
the
malpractice
limitation
law
did
not
exist,
the
doctor
would
never
have
opened
up
a
practice
because
he
could
not
afford
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
just
a
client
who
lives
across
the
street.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
is
in
perfect
health.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
does
not
like
having
a
doctor’s
office
instead
of
another
residence
across
the
street?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except,
in
each
case,
you
are
relying
on
some
statute
that
you
see
is
necessary
to
enable
that
particular
individual
to
function
in
the
capacity
to
function?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
constitutionally
my
hypothetical
is
a
case
of
controversy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
just
a
quick
fix,
is
it
not?
typically,
you
will
find
parties
vigorously
opposed
to
one
another
on
the
merits,
but
they
will
both
want
a
decision
on
the
merit
and
nonetheless,
we
have
held
in
some
cases
that
article
3
precludes
such
a
decision.
even
though,
perhaps,
at
a
time
when
article
3
would
not
preclude
it
is
by
no
means
an
ideal
time
in
the
sense
that
you
use
though
in
that
phrase
to
decide
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
just
like
the
house
across
the
street
from
the
doctor’s
office?
