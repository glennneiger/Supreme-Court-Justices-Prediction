chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
duke
power
v.
carolina
environmental
study
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
griffith,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
each
state
do
that
on
its
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of,
i
should
have
narrowed
it,
not
as
to
atomic
energy,
but
could
each
state
on
its
own
simply
provide
that
there
would
be
no
actions
for
injuries
of
the
described
character?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
once
the
price-anderson
act
had
been
enacted,
then
you
indicate
that
there
is
preemption
in
this
whole
field?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
not
ask
to
fractionate
the
time.
we
will
resume
at
1:00
with
the
next
argument.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
could
the
act
has
equally
well
and
equally
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
provided
for
no
liability
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
of
course,
there
would
have
been
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
no
act
had
been
passed
at
all
then
would
they
left
to
their
state
remedies
in
each
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
the
tangential
reference,
at
least
the
war
powers,
suppose
in
this
present
energy
crisis
the
president
decided
to
seize
all
of
the
existing
nuclear
power
plants
on
the
ground
that
the
whole
matter
had
to
be
consolidated
and
coordinated
with
the
energy
program,
in
other
words,
reasserting
its
monopoly
which
it
had
surrendered
piecemeal
in
the
limited
way,
do
you
think
war
powers
would
sustain
the
seizure
in
the
present
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
pretty
close
to
the
steel
mill’s
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
imminent
crisis
that
would
give
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
reasserting
the
control
simply
not
on
the
war
power,
but
on
the
power
of
its
basic
monopoly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
just
taking
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
this
act
was
passed,
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
there
have
been
power
in
the
federal
government
to
require
any
or
all
of
these
licensees
or
any
other
persons
to
construct
and
operate
these
plants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
subsidies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
at
least
caught
an
intimation
that
you
had
suggested
before
that
this
plan
was
in
effect
a
subsidy
indirectly,
though
you
did
not
call
it
that,
a
quid
pro
quo
if
they
were
willing
to
take
the
risks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
undoubtedly
familiar
with
the
power
reactor
development
case
which
came
out
of
your
old
circuit
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
first
experimental,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
concretion
of
40
or
50
utility
companies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
limit
on
liability
that
was
not
involved
in
that
case
but
was
there
any
contract
limiting
liability
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
not
at
issue
in
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
issue
in
the
power
reactor
development
case
was
weather
the
atomic
energy
commission
had
properly
evaluated
the
risks,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
schultz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
view
on
the
question
that
the
solicitor
general
addressed
if
the
government
had
maintained
its
own
monopoly
and
had
not
licensed
these
plants,
but
had
its
self
built
all
of
these
plans,
could
have
it
excluded
all
liability
as
a
modification
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
great
disasters
that
occurred
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act
when
sovereign
immunity
was
absolute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
anyone
allowed
to
make
a
case
on
the
taking
concept
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
injury
of
the
kind
we
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
finished
with
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
suits
were
brought
against
the
united
states
for
negligence
arising
out
of
the
kansas
city
flood
disasters
for
something
like
$1
billion
back
in
the
late
40s
or
early
50s,
no
recovery
was
allowed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
claim
was
that
the
weather
bureau
was
negligent
in
predicting
the
rainfall
and
the
engineers
were
negligent
in
not
predicting
the
flood
level?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory
of
taking,
when
the
kansas
city
floods
came,
it
took
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
land
that
were
under
cultivation
and
destroyed
all
the
crops
and
destroyed
all
kinds
of
plants
and
homes.
is
that
basically
different?
the
solicitor
general
said
the
atomic
genie
was
let
out
of
the
bottle.
here,
it
was
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
that
were
let
out
of
the
bottle
allegedly
by
the
government’s
negligence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
for
the
moment
that
the
government
tried
to
solve
this
problem
by
taking
over
all
of
the
plants
which
they
have
licensed
to
obtain
just
compensation
so
that
all
the
plants
were
being
operated
and
owned
by
the
united
states
government
as
a
monopoly.
then,
the
tort
claims
act
was
modified
if
that
were
thought
necessary
to
say
that
“for
purposes
of
the
tort
claims
act,
this
is
a
discretionary
governmental
operation
and
no
liability
whatever,”
any
problem
about
the
constitutionality
of
that?
in
other
words,
the
restoration
of
the
old
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
theory,
of
taking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
have
taken
my
life.
if
i
were
one
of
the
victims,
you
have
taken
my
life
and
you
must
be
my
widow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
face
of
the
limitation
that
i
placed
in
my
hypothetical
question
of
no
liability
on
the
government,
on
what
basis
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
follow
that
if
they
can
eliminate
all
liability,
then
they
can
define
the
liability
and
put
the
limits
on
it,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
parallel
with
the
efforts
of
some
state
legislatures
to
unite
statutes?
is
it
absolute
that
limited
liability
for
all
personal
injuries
applying
in
general
the
workman’s
compensation
principle
to
all
automobile
injuries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
of
them
limit
the
liability,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
much
below
the
verdicts
which
are
currently
being
rendered
by
juries
in
common
law
actions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
there
is
a
limit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
another
realistic
limitation
on
my
ability?
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
however,
many
millions
of
dollars
are
invested
into
an
atomic
energy
plant,
and
many
millions
and
millions
would
be,
and
then
let
us
assume
these
dire
predictions
that
have
been
mentioned
to
occur
and
the
terribly
tragic
results
which
would
be
a
series
of
rings
would
produce
liability
far
beyond
the
total
assets
of
the
particular
corporation,
is
that
not
highly
probable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
an
economic
limit
on
the
liability
already
that
you
cannot
get
any
more
money
out
of
that
plant
that
it
has
and
if
their
plant
has
been
destroyed
or
badly
damaged
in
the
process,
what
chance
has
any
claimant
got
of
getting
full
recovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
hypothetical
was
that
you
had
a
very
daring
enterpriser
who
had
a
lot
of
money,
a
howard
hues
type,
so
he
did
not
care
where
he
put
in
$1
billion
to
build
the
plant.
the
plant
did
damage
that
costs
$3-billion
worth
of
injury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
reality,
is
it,
that
the
damage
coming
from
this
hypothetical
plant
could
vastly
exceed
the
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
economic
limit
that
i
was
suggesting
to
you
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
now,
mr.
schultz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
on
this
side
of
the
table?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
gentlemen.

case
