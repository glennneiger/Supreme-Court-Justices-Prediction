unknown
speaker
is
there
any
attack
on
this
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
beyond
the
congressional
power
of
congress
to
enact?
unknown
speaker
but
nonetheless,
our
congress
is
a
legislative
body
of
a
government
of
limited
and
delegated
power,
but
i
had
not
understood
that
there
was
any
attack
upon
the
basic
power
of
congress
under
the
constitution
to
enact
this
legislation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
the
government
assumed
total
responsibility
for
all
damage,
would
you
still
object?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
you
are
not
opposing
the
construction
of
nuclear
power
plants?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have,
from
the
outset
of
these
plans,
have
you
not?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
opposed
to
both?
unknown
speaker
and
they
oppose
the
initial
licensing
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
objective
is
to
stop
the
operation
of
this
plant?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same
thing.
you
repeal
the
libel
law,
you
give
the
newspaper
cart
blanche
to
say
what
it
wants
to,
it
is
going
to
say
a
lot
more
reckless
and
injurious
things.
it
is
quite
clear.
here,
you
repeal
the
damage
limitation,
you
build
some
comic
plans
and
one
fails
and
somebody
is
going
to
get
hurt.
it
is
the
same
thing,
at
least
i
do
not
see
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
let
me
follow
through
on
that.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
limitation
by
statute
on
medical
malpractice
liability?
unknown
speaker
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
off
that
slippery
slope
between
half-a-million
dollars
and
zero?
unknown
speaker
there
are
limitations
on
the
availability
of
insurance.
we
even
have
a
case
here.
unknown
speaker
of
course
there
have
been
many
instances
of
physicians
giving
up
practice
because
of
malpractice
threats?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
mr.
schultz,
would
it
not
be
the
best
time
after
the
accident
because
then
we
would
know
whether
the
fit
was
good
or
not
and
also
if
the
statute
should
then
be
held
unconstitutional,
the
limitation
held
invalid,
all
the
victims
would
recover
their
entire
damages.
is
it
not
the
utility
that
takes
the
risk
of
unconstitutionality?
unknown
speaker
yes,
there
are.
unknown
speaker
the
first
point
is,
would
we
not
be
better
able
to
decide
whether
the
$560-million
limitation
is
reasonable
after
we
know
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
how
that
responds
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
have
better
and
certainly
more
knowledge
about
it
after
than
you
do
before,
before
there
has
ever
been
one?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
extent
there
is
a
difference
before
and
after,
it
is
better
to
litigate
it
after,
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
not
a
reason
why
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
to
wait
also?
does
that
(voice
overlap)
on
your
opponent's
--
unknown
speaker
no,
but
there
is
a
greater
likelihood,
you
say?
