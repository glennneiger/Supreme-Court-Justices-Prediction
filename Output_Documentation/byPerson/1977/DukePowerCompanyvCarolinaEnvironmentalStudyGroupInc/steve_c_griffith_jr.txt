mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
north
carolina
declared
the
limitation
of
liability
provisions
within
the
price-anderson
act
to
be
unconstitutional.
duke
appeals
to
this
court
on
two
questions.
the
first
is,
is
the
cause
justiciable
under
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
two,
whether
the
limitation
of
liability
provisions
is
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause?
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
was
passed
by
congress
to
encourage
the
wide
bread
application
of
a
peaceful
use
of
atomic
energy
in
medicine,
agriculture
and
industry,
but
particularly
in
the
generation
of
electric
power.
by
1957,
congress
had
determined
that
economics
was
the
foremost
obstacle
to
the
development
of
nuclear
power
plants.
i
say
this
because
of
the
“but
for”
argument
which
is
so
central
both
in
the
plaintiff’s
brief
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
if
there
is
a
“but
for”
argument
or
cause
in
this
matter,
it
is
with
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
and
not
with
the
amendments
that
consist
of
the
price-anderson.
but
congress
determined
that
there
was
a
further
problem
to
the
development
of
the
nuclear
power
plant
and
that
was
the
potentially
great
liability
exposure
for
a
large
accident,
although
the
probabilities
of
such
an
accident
occurring
were
exceedingly
small.
so
small
in
fact
that
they
were
not
being
creditable
although
the
possibility
did
exist.
the
price-anderson
amendments
to
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
was
the
congressional
solution
to
this
problem.
the
price-anderson
has
two
objectives.
the
first
is
to
protect
the
public
against
uncompensated
loss
resulting
from
the
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy
and
second
is
to
protect
the
industry
against
the
risk
of
unlimited
liability
in
the
unlikely
and
remote
event
that
a
catastrophic
accident
might
occur.
limitation
of
liability
provisions
is
not
peculiar
to
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
nuclear
power
plants.
nineteen
nations
have
similar
legislation
as
shown
in
our
exhibit
19.
the
objective
of
protecting
the
public
in
price-anderson
was
accomplished
in
two
ways.
first
through
mandatory
insurance
and
second
through
governmental
indemnity.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
no
state
laws
passed
with
respect
to
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
nor
were
there
any
limitations
or
liability
provisions
or
special
acts
to
compensate.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
would
not
have.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
removed
the
common
law
remedy
of
unlimited
liability.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
the
workman’s
compensation
law
is
a
state
law.
all
states
have
those.
there
are
limitations
on
the
common
law
rights.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
court
has
found
that
in
the
northern
states
power
case
that
congress
has
very
clearly
preempted
this
field.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
any
specific
words
with
respect
to
that.
no,
sir.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
no,
sir.
what
it
did
in
effect
was
to
create
a
federal
fund,
if
i
might,
out
of
which
claimants
from
a
possible
accident
might
proceed
against
rather
than
the
individual
industries
involved
if
the
accident
were
unlimited
liability.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
does,
absolutely.
in
1966,
congress
created
absolute
liability
for
any
substantial
nuclear
accident
by
requiring
mandatory
waivers
of
defenses.
further
amendments
were
made
in
1975.
the
statute
of
limitations
waiver
was
extended
further
and
a
second
self-insurance
pool
of
liability
insurance
was
established
and
this
will
phase
out
the
governmental
indemnity
and
will
allow
the
limitation
of
liability
currently
$560
million
to
move
upward.
by
1985,
that
limit
could
be
$1
billion.
the
congress
also
expressly
stated
in
the
act
in
1975
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
an
accident
might
exceed
$500
million,
that
it
will
“take
whatever
action
is
deemed
necessary
and
appropriate
to
protect
the
public
from
the
consequences
of
a
disaster
of
such
magnitude.”
there
are
now
62
operating
nuclear
power
reactors
in
the
united
states
producing
approximately
10%
of
the
nation’s
electricity
and
there
are
approximately
150
either
planned
or
under
construction.
no
accident
had
a
licensed
nuclear
power
reactor
involving
radiation,
injury,
disease
or
death
to
a
member
of
the
public
has
ever
occurred.
a
nuclear
explosion
at
a
power
reactor
is
not
possible.
the
only
way
that
a
catastrophic
accident
could
occur
would
be
a
core
melt
which
breaches
the
containment
building
and
releases
a
large
amount
of
radioactive
material.
just
like
a
coal-fired
plant,
a
nuclear
power
reactor
produces
heat
to
turn
water
into
steam
to
drive
the
turbines
to
produce
electricity.
a
nuclear
power
reactor
obtains
this
heat
from
its
uranium
fuel
in
two
ways.
approximately
a
93%
of
the
heat
is
obtained
by
way
of
the
nuclear
chain
reaction
and
the
balance
about
7%
comes
from
the
decay
of
nuclear
materials.
the
nuclear
chain
reaction
maybe
stopped
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
so
that
it
produces
no
further
heat,
but
the
decay
heat
cannot
be
so
quickly
terminated.
a
core
melt
would
take
place
if
the
fuel
were
deprived
of
its
normal
and
emergency
cooling
waters
so
as
to
allow
the
heat
to
build
up.
this
could
cause
the
fuel
to
melt.
the
heat,
thereby,
created
could
be
sufficient
to
melt
through
the
bottom
of
the
building
or
possibly
lead
to
a
breach
of
the
containment
building.
because
a
breach
of
the
containment
building
poses
the
threat
of
a
large
scale
accident
taking
place
in
terms
of
damages
to
the
outside
public,
the
greatest
care
is
taken
in
the
design,
construction
and
operation
of
the
reactor
in
order
to
reduce
to
the
absolute
minimum,
the
attendant
risk
to
the
public.
congress
passed
price-anderson
on
the
findings
that
the
risk
of
a
very
large
accident
occurring
was
exceedingly
small.
this
finding
has
been
substantiated
by
further
and
extensive
studies
and
the
operating
experience
of
the
nuclear
power
reactors.
in
1965,
the
joint
committee
of
the
congress
reported
that
the
likelihood
of
a
major
reactor
accident
was
exceedingly
low
and
that
no
reactor
would
be
licensed
in
this
country
if
there
was
“a
reasonable
likelihood
that
its
operation
might
result
in
an
accident
of
the
severity
contemplated
by
the
price-anderson
legislation.”
the
reactor
safety
study,
under
the
direction
of
professor
rasmussen
of
mit
and
a
professional
staff
of
60
persons
was
published
in
october
1975.
the
study
confirmed
previous
findings
by
congress
of
the
very
low
risk
of
a
catastrophic
accident
occurring.
plaintiffs
and
other
critics
differ
with
this
study
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
the
study
estimates
of
an
accident
of
such
magnitude
occurring
might
be
an
error.
plaintiff’s
own
witness
put
the
error
at
like
a
factor
of
10
because
he
said,
“for
an
error
much
in
excess
of
10,
one
would
find
a
contradiction
with
the
present
operating
experience.”
now,
that
was
more
than
a
year-and-a
half
ago.
while
the
court
below
said
“it
is
not
a
bookie,”
the
unblemished
operating
experience
of
300
reactor
years
in
this
country
and
1,000
years
worldwide
receive
scant
attention
from
the
court
below.
as
one
witness
put
it,
“if
there
were
any
high
probability
of
an
accident
scenario,
we
would
at
least
have
seen
some
damage
to
the
public
or
the
environment
in
all
of
the
years
a
reactor
operating
experience.”
addressing
the
questions
in
this
case,
first,
as
to
the
justiciability
issue,
we
have
discussed
the
case
or
controversy
issues
in
our
main
brief,
at
pages
27-52
in
our
appendix
a.
we
stand
on
our
arguments
there
and
would
not
further
argue
them
except
to
say,
in
our
view,
the
mere
possibility
of
an
injury
from
a
postulated
accident
is
not
enough
to
give
standing.
turning
now
to
the
arguments
on
the
merits;
congress
has
legislated
in
a
field
in
which
it
has
undoubted
power.
it
relied
primarily
upon
the
commerce
power,
but
there
are
others,
the
national
defense,
the
general
welfare
and
the
bankruptcy
powers.
in
the
field
of
economic
regulation
once
congress
has
acted
within
its
power,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
attaches
and
in
a
case
like
this,
the
burden
is
on
the
complaining
party
to
demonstrate
that
congress
has
acted
in
an
arbitrary
or
irrational
way.
plaintiffs
have
failed
to
carry
this
burden
and
by
implication,
we
suggest,
admit
that
they
cannot
meet
the
rationality
standard
when
they
suggest
a
higher
standard
of
review.
they
first
suggest
that
the
issue
here
is
similar
to
that
decided
in
the
sterilization
case
of
skinner
v.
oklahoma.
they
then
retreat
from
that
position
advocating
an
intermediate
level
of
review,
but
that
position
is
not
held
for
very
long,
for
in
the
very
next
breath,
they
revive
the
test
of
skinner
when
they
say
that
price-anderson
is
the
“but
for
cause”
of
a
nuclear
catastrophe
that
is
certain
to
occur.
they
say
“the
fact
that
the
government
is
a
principal
cause
of
the
injury
also
makes
this
case
like
skinner,
since
it
was
the
state
in
skinner
that
ordered
the
sterilization.”
the
implication
of
this
argument
is
crystal
clear
and
that
is,
that
the
decision
by
congress
to
encourage
the
peaceful
applications
of
atomic
energy
in
the
private
promotion
of
nuclear
power
plants
to
provide
a
diverse
energy
source
for
this
country
was
a
reprehensible
decision.
therefore,
they
argue,
this
court
should
agree
with
them
and
substitute
its
judgment
on
this
question
of
national
policy
for
that
of
congress.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
clearly
to
the
contrary.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
is
only
concerned
with
the
power
of
congress
and
not
with
its
wisdom.
only
if
the
statute
manifests
a
patently
arbitrary
classification,
oddly
lacking
in
rational
justification,
is
it
unconstitutional
to
test
provided
in
fleming
v.
nesda
(ph),
but
even
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
a
higher
standard
of
review
is
necessary,
the
price-anderson
amendments
meet
a
carefully
tuned-balancing
of
alternative
considerations.
the
congress
could
have
and
did
consider
alternatives
and
among
those
were
unlimited
governmental
liability
and
a
direct
insurance
program
with
a
compensation
plan.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is,
if
you
go
to
the
highest
standard
of
review
than
the
rationality
test,
the
rationality
test,
which
i
think
and
we
urge
very
strongly
in
this
case,
is
simply
one,
was
there
any
basis
on
which
a
rational
finding
can
be
made
for
congress
legislating
in
this
field
and
certainly,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
congress
had.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
we
submit
that
the
act
does
meet
that
fine-tuning.
the
answer
to
the
problems
perceived
by
congress
to
the
development
of
the
nuclear
power
industry
was
price-anderson
and
that
was
to
require
industry
to
guard
against
accidents
of
a
conceivable,
though
not
expected
magnitude,
by
available
insurance,
to
assure
the
public
of
protection
above
that
amount
up
to
a
point,
but
refuse
to
commit
in
advance
public
moneys
to
pay
the
cost
of
an
almost
inconceivable
catastrophe.
that
result
is
eminently
rational
and
reasonable,
but
this
court
has
never
applied
either
strict
scrutiny
or
an
intermediate
standard
of
review
to
a
statute
which
limits
liability
or
otherwise
modifies
common
law
remedies
for
future
torts.
it
has,
instead
considered,
whether
the
statute
served
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
for
dealing
with
a
perceived
problem.
this,
we
contend,
is
the
rationality
test,
but
if
more
than
rationality
is
required
such
as
the
suggestions
of
this
court
has
required
in
the
removal
of
common
law
remedies
that
a
quid
pro
quo
must
be
provided
in
its
place,
we
do
not
subscribe
to
that
view,
but
if
that
is
assumed
for
argument’s
sake,
we
suggest
that
the
act
provides
substantial
quid
pro
quo.
it
assures
a
fund
to
pay
claims.
it
imposes
absolute
liability.
it
weighs
short
statutes
of
limitations.
it
provides
for
payment
of
claims
without
releases.
it
provides
for
fair
treatment
of
latent
injuries
and
it
eliminates
completely
the
rush
to
the
courthouse
door
which
would
exist
without
the
substitution
of
price-anderson
for
the
common
law
state
remedies.
it
eliminates
the
rush
to
the
courthouse
door
to
establish
a
claim
and
to
perfect
the
judgment
lien
and
funds
are
available
to
pay
claims
without
regard
to
who
is
liable.
turning
now
to
plaintiff’s
argument
that
the
remedy
provided
by
price-anderson
is
inadequate.
this
argument
is
based
upon
two
fallacious
assumptions.
the
first
assumption
is
that
the
catastrophic
accident
they
describe
is
certain
to
occur.
the
second
assumption
is
that
following
such
a
catastrophic
accident,
congress
will
do
nothing.
the
first
assumption
is
contrary
to
the
conclusion
congress
reached
in
light
of
all
the
information
which
was
before
the
district
court
and
much
more.
the
second
assumption
is
contrary
to
the
pledge
of
congress
stated
in
the
law,
and
also
contrary
to
the
history
of
congressional
appropriations
with
respect
to
national
disasters,
which
it
is
interesting
to
note,
plaintiffs
acknowledge
the
context.
plaintiffs
also
attempt
to
explain
away
the
analogy
of
the
limitation
of
liability
in
connection
with
ships
and
airlines
by
suggesting
that
in
the
case
of
ships,
the
injured
bystander
could
have
insured
against
the
loss
and
with
respect
to
airlines,
the
injured
person
may
receive
up
to
the
limit
of
$75,000
per
claim.
but
in
the
case
of
price-anderson,
the
insurance
is
provided
not
by
the
innocent
bystander,
but
by
the
industry
and
even
with
a
limitation
of
liability
of
$560
million,
an
accident
with
5,000
claims
would
yield
up
to
$112,000
per
claim.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
well
sir,
the
quid
pro
quo
would
be
provided
if
congress
acts
after
the
fact.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
that
is
precisely
the
question
we
raised
in
our
jurisdictional
argument.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
will
never
know,
but
if
congress
does
act,
and
i
think
it
is
more
logical
to
assume
that
they
will
than
they
will
not
in
the
event
of
a
catastrophe
of
the
limits
that
is
described
in
this
case,
then
it
satisfies
the
due
process
requirement.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
can.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
the
direct
answer,
in
my
opinion,
is
no.
surely
the
limitation
of
liability
to
promote
additional
and
diverse
energy
supplies
by
encouraging
the
private
development
of
nuclear
power
is
at
least
as
rational
as
are
the
limitations
of
liability
found
acceptable
in
the
shipping
and
airline
industries
and
in
the
workman’s
compensation
cases.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steve
c.
griffith,
jr.
it
simply
boils
down
as
the
plaintiffs
suggest
in
their
argument
that
there
were
alternatives
available
to
congress,
which
congress
considered
such
as
writing
a
blank
check
on
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
but
congress
decided
that
that
was
not
in
the
public
interest.
they
did
have
the
power
to
limit
the
amount
available
for
a
creditable
accident,
one
that
they
thought
might
have
a
chance
of
occurring,
but
for
the
uncreditable
accident,
congress
did
not
feel
that
it
had
to
go
that
far
to
cover
that
eventuality.
there
is
where
congress
promised
to
act
in
the
