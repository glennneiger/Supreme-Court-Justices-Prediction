stewart
if
the
whole
business
had
been
left
with
a
federal
government,
there
would
not
have
been
any
state
remedies
presumably
and
there
would
have
been
an
action
against
the
federal
government,
but
that
would
not
have
existed
because
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
absence
of
something
like
a
federal
tort
claims
act?
