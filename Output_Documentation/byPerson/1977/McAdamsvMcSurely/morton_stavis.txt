mr.
morton
stavis
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
reason
why
the
interrogation
of
mr.
easterbrook
has
developed
as
it
did
and
why
the
government
had
to
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
as
it
did
is
because
in
fact
the
government
in
its
petition
and
its
brief
has
staked
out
a
rather
extreme
position
and
seeks
an
interpretation
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
is
highly
unacceptable.
but
surprisingly
the
government
as
it
developed
its
position
takes
no
account
to
the
fact
that
this
tension,
to
use
the
word
of
mr.
rehnquist,
between
the
problems
of
protecting
congressional
independence
while
at
the
same
time
avoiding
abuse
is
a
problem
which
is
a
thoroughly
familiar
problem,
in
english
constitutional
history
and
it
has
a
problem
which
this
which
this
court
has
dealt
time
and
time
and
time
again.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
the
only
question
that
the
government
presented
in
its
petition.
mr.
morton
stavis
well
that
is
assumed.
it
has
not
been
disputed
and
the
motion
papers
raise
only
the
question
of
immunity.
now,
it
is
not
as
if
as
this
problem
has
first
come
before
this
court
today
or
that
the
government
is
writing
on
a
clean
slate.
the
reality
is
that
the
court
has
always
understood
that
precisely
because
the
speech
and
debate
immunity
is
absolute,
it
is
not
to
be
so
widely
handed
out.
it
is
limited
in
scope
and
limited
to
the
kinds
of
activities
that
it
applies
to.
and
in
case
they
have
to
case
and
various
language
formulation
what
comes
out
is
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
applies
to
the
core
of
legislative
activity.
congressman
and
senators
making
speeches,
voting,
holding
hearings,
committee
reports
and
then
servicemen’s,
issuing
subpoenas,
but
it
does
not
apply
to
peripheral
activities,
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
activities
that
congressman
and
senators
engage
in,
to
which
it
simply
does
not
apply.
and
of
course
one
of
the
clearest
formulations
of
that
mr.
chief
justice
was
in
your
own
opinion
in
the
brewster
case.
when
senator
brewster
came
here
and
said
it
applies
to
all
matters
that
relate
to
legislative
activity
and
of
course
the
court
held
that
that
was
not
the
case.
now,
there
was
an
important
and
rather
clear
line
which
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
cases
where
speech
and
debate
immunity
should
apply
and
which
is
rather
confusingly
addressed
by
mr.
easterbrook
when
he
deals
with
the
dembrowski
case.
as
constant
formulation
it
says
that
in
the
dembrowski
case
this
court
approved
the
takeover
of
documents,
but
that
was
pursuant
to
a
subpoena.
a
subpoena
was
served
and
the
person
who
is
served
with
the
subpoena
responded
by
delivering
the
documents
and
court
approved
that
process.
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
the
action
complained
off
occurred
without
benefit
of
any
subpoena
whatsoever.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
taking
of
these
papers,
the
reading
of
all
of
these
papers,
the
bringing
of
them
to
washington
which
is
the
heart
of
what
this
complaint
is
about.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
initial
act
was
the
receipt
of
the
papers.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
actually
we
are
going
down
pipe
flow,
taking
the
papers
from
the
state
officials,
inspecting
all
the
papers
that
had
been
seized,
doing
this
and
bring
them
back
to
washington
knowing
that
plaintiffs
had
gone
to
court
to
obtain
a
return
of
their
papers
and
the
court
had
agreed
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
return
of
their
papers
and
had
given
the
safekeeping
order
only
to
give
the
respond
of
the
defendant
there
namely
the
prosecuting
attorney
an
opportunity
to
appeal
if
he
chose.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
am
not
really
sure
of
that
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
know
that
eastland
against
servicemen
is
an
important
argument
for
the
suggestions
that
you
are
making
mr.
justice
stevens
because
there
the
court
held
in
effect
that
when
the
government,
when
the
committee
issues
a
subpoena
that
that
is
a
process
that
the
court
will
not
interfere
with
at
least
in
a
suit
against
the
senator.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct
nor
did
it
say
anything
as
to
what
could
be
done
to
prevent
ratcliffe
from
turning
over
the
documents
by
a
suit
against
ratcliffe
which
is
essentially
what
we
did
after
ratcliffe
was
served
with
a
subpoena.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
after
the
acts
to
which
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
senator
did
issue
a
subpoena.
the
subpoena
was
served
on
ratcliffe.
we
then
sued
ratcliffe
to
prevent
his
complying
with
the
subpoena
and
we
succeeded
in
the
sixth
circuit
so
that
i
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
am
not
so
sure
where
it
had
been
done
in
a
manner,
so
that
we
were
kept
unaware
of
it.
fortunately,
in
this
case
when
ratcliffe
was
served
with
a
subpoena,
we,
the
mcsurelys
were
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no
i
am
not
sir,
if
i
may
suggest.
i
am
simply
saying
that
where
there
is
no
subpoena
there
can
be
no
argument
about
it.
where
there
is
a
subpoena,
i
think
the
problem
becomes
a
little
bit
more
difficult.
i
think
that
servicemen’s
funds
left
open
the
possibility
that
the
servicemen’s
fund
could
have
sued
the
bank
to
have
enjoined
them
from
responding
to
the
subpoena.
now,
you
are
putting
me
a
question
of
what
would
happen
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
might
not
be
very
much
different
from
a
subpoena.
the
thing
that
i
am
driving
at
is
that
the
process
of
the
subpoena
at
least
gives
you
a
basis
for
litigating
--
mr.
morton
stavis
if
you
know
about
it.
look
mr.
brick,
in
servicemen’s
fund,
they
might
as
just
go
into
the
bank
and
ask
to
see
the
records
and
we
do
not
know
anything
about
it
then
i
think
there
is
another
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
taking
of
those
records
constitutes
some
kind
of
an
invasion
of
rights
where
the
fourth
amendment
or
privacy
rights,
whatever
it
is
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
i
am
prepared,
however,
to
say
that
where
there
is
no
subpoena,
where
there
is
no
process
at
all,
and
a
congressional
employee
or
a
congressman
or
a
senator
just
proceeds
on
his
own
allegedly
to
engage
of
investigative
activities
then
you
get
exactly
the
kind
of
questions
that
were
put
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
some
of
the
others.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct
and
that
comes
out
of
the
recognition
of
this
court
from
the
beginning
that
you
have
to
circumscribe
the
space
in
the
back
room.
mr.
morton
stavis
same
problem.
unless
you
circumscribe
the
areas
of
activity
to
which
you
are
for
immunity
you
build
up
a
rather
large
number
of
people
who
have
the
power
to
snoop
around
and
break
the
law
engaged
in
a
wide
range
of
activities
and
just
reflect
for
a
moment
as
to
what
might
even
happen
if
some
employee
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
or
the
house
judiciary
committee
might
decide
to
break
into
the
homes
of
some
judges.
mr.
morton
stavis
not
at
all,
not
since
the
gravel
case.
i
think
the
gravel
case
made
it
clear
that
they
were
both
on
the
same
footing.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
not
the
position.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
the
point
and
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
not
that
the
immunity
applies
only
to
lawful
acts.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
the
immunity
does
not
apply
to
mere
general
investigatory
acts.
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
making
that
you
have
to
define
the
nature
of
the
activities
that
we
are
dealing
with
and
if
we
are
dealing
with
general
investigatory
conduct,
the
general
investigatory
conduct
does
not
carry
with
it
an
immunity
and
i
am
distinguishing
there
of
what
may
happen
if
you
have
a
subpoena.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
do
not
think
it
was
quite
separated
as
your
honor
suggests.
judge
wilkie’s
analysis
was
that
he
recognized
with
judge
leventhal
that
the
speech
and
debate
clause
immunity
would
not
apply
to
unlawful
acts
and
he
then
proceeded
to
analyze
it
and
say
was
there
an
unlawful
committed,
he
decided
that
there
was
not.
the
government
does
not
press
that
position.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
that
is
not
the
analytical
approach
that
we
have
taken.
the
analytical
approach
that
we
have
taken
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
character
of
the
activity
to
which
an
effort
is
being
made
to
immunize
it
and
see
whether
that
activity
is
at
the
core
of
legislative
activity.
i
suppose
a
senator
can
get
up
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
make
a
speech
and
say
anything,
anything
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
possibly
even
giving
out
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right,
in
the
committee
hearing
that
is
the
point.
if
it
is
making
a
speech
on
the
floor,
conducting
himself
in
a
committee
hearing,
i
suppose
he
cannot
be
committing
a
criminal
act
or
he
cannot
be
held
of
a
criminal
act
nor
for
civil
liability.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
and
it
is
again
is
precisely
because
that
is
a
rather
extreme
immunity,
quite
an
extreme
immunity
that
the
court
has
been
very
careful
to
say
only
for
that,
but
not
for
other
things,
perfect
good
examples,
killborn
v.
thompson.
you
have
got
immunity
for
voting
on
the
resolution
which
ordered
the
sergeant
at
arms
to
arrest
this
man.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
would
think
it
would.
mr.
morton
stavis
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
receipt
of
property
is
essential
to
the
legislative
process.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
would
argue
that
no
matter
how
relevant
that
the
process
of
receiving
evidence
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
clear
as
distinguished
from
having
you
pour
it
out
at
a
hearing.
mr.
morton
stavis
not
if
it
was
done
in
response
to
a
subpoena.
i
think
there
is
a
point
at
which
you
have
to
draw
some
kind
of
a
line
to
protect
the
committee
processes
by
subpoena.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
would
think
not.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
reason
is
that
at
least
by
a
subpoena.
at
least
a
subpoena
is
a
matter
of
legislative
authority.
a
senator
does
not
--
mr.
morton
stavis
it
may
not
be.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
committee
does
not
have
the
power
of
subpoena
in
a
particular
case.
a
senator
or
that
is
only
by
resolution.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
had
been
infinite
number
of
cases
before
this
court
where
the
validity
of
a
subpoena
has
been
subject
to
question.
an
individual
obviously
can
refuse
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
then
can
litigate
its
validity.
a
third
party
can
do
so
too.
in
this
case,
we
sued
the
third
party
to
prevent
his
complying
with
the
subpoena.
mr.
morton
stavis
two
questions
that
are
raised
by
that,
one,
was
it
an
unlawful
act
to
hold
onto
that
material
once
it
was
realized
how
this
material
had
been
obtained.
that
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
an
unlawful
act.
the
second
question
is
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
but
it
might
very
well
be
an
unlawful
act
to
hold
onto
material
which
you
knew
that
you
were
in
no
way
entitled
to
which
is
a
different
question
which
is
what
actually
happened
here,
but
the
second
question,
is
the
receipt
of
that
material
and
that
is
the
critical
question
that
you
are
putting,
is
the
mere
receipt
of
that
material
subject
to
immunity?
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
as
i
suggested,
not
in
the
light
of
gravel
and
since
gravel,
we
cannot
distinguish
between
the
two,
but
again
i
am
suggesting
that
the
receipt
of
material
as
part
of
a
committee
investigator
function
is
not
at
the
core
of
legislative
activity
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
quite
the
contrary
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
think
that
the
cases
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
we
can,
i
think
we
can
agree.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
let
me
suggest,
let
me
suggest
--
mr.
morton
stavis
let
me
make
a
reasonable
try
at
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
language
of
the
constitution
of
course
is
only
speech
and
debate.
now,
the
cases
have
held
that
it
goes
beyond
speech
and
debate,
that
it
includes
voting,
it
includes
holding
hearings,
it
includes
issuance
of
subpoenas.
i
think
we
are
quite
able
to
develop
a
core
of
activities
from
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
have
been
decided
upon.
issuance
of
reports
by
committees
is
another
one,
but
no
case
has
held
that
it
includes
unlawful
investigative
activity.
in
view
of
the
argument
that
is
made,
that
the
lawfulness
or
non
lawfulness
cannot
be
the
test
of
whether
or
not
immunity
applies,
we
must
conclude
that
no
case
is
held
that
it
includes
investigative
activity
generally
of
an
undefined
nature
other
than
--
mr.
morton
stavis
well
that
is
what
i
do
not
have
to
decide,
but
that
is
what
these
people
constantly
claim.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
it
is
the
best
word
that
i
am
able
to
find
to
try
and
to
define
what
i
think
is
the
range
of
activities
that
the
court
has
said
are
included
within
the
kinds
of
legislative
conduct
for
which
congressmen
and
senators
are
entitled
to
immunity.
now,
it
clearly
does
not
include
distribution
of
reports.
that
is
the
essence
of
doe
against
mcmillan.
it
clearly
does
not
include
impressing
a
constituent’s
position
on
the
administrative
agency.
that
is
united
states
against
johnson.
it
certainly
does
not
include
taking
money
in
one
form
or
another,
that
is
united
states
against
brewster.
the
court
has
been
trying
to
do
its
best
to
develop
the
meaning
of
the
term
core
and
i
think
that
that
the
court
has
said
in
dembrowski,
in
gravel,
and
it
has
said
in
both
those
cases
that
it
does
not
include
general
investigatory
activities.
i
think
it
is
extremely
important
that
i
point
out
that
what
mr.
easterbrook
said
about
dembrowski
is
simply
in
conflict
with
the
record.
mr.
easterbrook
said
that
the
dembrowski
case
is
different
from
this
because
there,
all
that
mr.
sourwine
was
trying
to
do
was
to
help
out
the
state
officials
of
louisiana
while
they
made
their
raid
and
he
was
acting
not
to
assist
in
a
senate
investigation,
but
to
assist
in
enforcement
of
state
law.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
the
issue
in
dembrowski
against
sourwine
which
is
again
very
different
from
this
case,
was
that
there,
the
defendants
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
substantial
issue
or
fact
and
there,
senator
eastland
supported
his
position
with
seven
affidavits
which
said
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
whatsoever
and
the
court
accepted
that
position
and
agreed
that
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
of
course,
there
was
no
substantial
issue
of
fact,
there
was
no
basis
for
holding
the
senator
in.
mr.
morton
stavis
no
sir.
it
did
involve
a
claim
of
speech
or
debate
immunity,
but
the
senator
said
i
was
no
involved.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
did
as
to
sourwine
because
as
to
sourwine,
he
argued
speech
and
debate
immunity,
but
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
trivial
issue
of
fact
and
that
that
speech
and
debate
immunity
would
not
protect
him.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
it
would
not
protect
him
from
the
kind
of
conduct
in
which
he
engaged.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
if
there
were
any
basis
for
holding
eastland
in,
but
eastland
was
not
held
in
on
a
factual
consideration.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
but
he
still
claimed
speech
or
debate
immunity
and
the
court
held
speech
or
debate
immunity
did
not
extend
to
the
kind
of
conduct
charged
him.
mr.
morton
stavis
he
would
be
in
the
sour.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
it
after
gravel,
but
the
point
that
i
was
pressing
on
dembrowski
because
i
really
think
it
is
the
critical
case
here,
it
is
the
case
in
which
this
all
turns,
is
that
the
government
wants
to
get
away
from
dembrowski
by
saying
that
they
were
not
performing
a
senate
legislative
purpose,
they
were
just
helping
out
their
colleagues
in
louisiana.
i
am
simply
saying
that
that
is
directly
contrary
to
what
the
government
said
in
its
briefs
in
dembrowski
where
it
insisted
that
sourwine
was
carrying
out
an
important
legislative
purpose
and
cited
all
the
resolutions
that
he
was
supposedly
investigating
for
and
the
government
in
sourwine
insisted
that
that
was
what
he
was
doing.
this
court
in
gravel
when
it
referred
to
the
dembrowski
case,
said
specifically
that
he
was
searching,
seizing
material
in
preparation
for
a
senate
committee
hearing.
so
dembrowski
is
of
no
force
with
this
case
contrary
to
what
mr.
easterbrook
had
said
and
dembrowski
holds
that
kind
of
activity
just
is
not
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
morton
stavis
these
newspaper
reporters,
it
might
very
well
be.
the
papers
after
all
have
been
unlawfully
seized.
mr.
morton
stavis
mr.
brick
is
certainly
subject
to
the
constitution.
he
is
a
federal
employee.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
did
not
think
i
was,
but
the
point
is
that
if
the
documents
have
been
unlawfully
seized
and
a
newspaper
reporter
takes
custody
of
these
documents,
there
may
very
well
be
a
violation
of
local
state
law
because
the
documents
were
in
effect
were
stolen.
now,
but
that
is
not
the
fourth
amendment
issue
to
which
we
are
referring.
obviously,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
a
private
person,
but
mr.
brick
was
not
a
private
person
and
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
him.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
it
is
conceded
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
do
argue
that
in
our
brief.
we
do
cite
that
specific
holding
of
gravel
for
that
purpose.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
--[laughter]
mr.
morton
stavis
the
reason
that
i
have
given
more
emphasis
on
dembrowski
against
eastland
is
because
it
is
a
closer
case
to
this
in
terms
of
the
facts.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
story
of
dembrowski
against
eastland
which
is
a
mississippi
story
and
the
story
here
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of
where
a
senate
committee
or
any
congressional
committee
undertook
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
activities
that
were
engaged
in
here
which
was
effectively
to
take
over
documents
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
i
did.
the
only
thing
i
did
not
do
is
cite
the
gravel
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
dembrowski
against
eastland
too,
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
does
really
because
that
was
also
information
gathering
activity.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
would
not
think
so
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
i
do
not
think
that
a
committee
chairman
acquires
any
more
immunity
than
an
ordinary
senator.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
that
is
the
case,
but
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
extent
of
immunity.
all
we
are
dealing
with
here
really,
the
only
real
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
what
kinds
of
activities
does
the
immunity
apply
to?
mr.
morton
stavis
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
chairman
of
a
committee
engages
in
more
committee
activities
than
a
garden
variety
senator
and
to
that
extent,
he
would
be
more
involved
with
questions
of
immunity
in
connection
with
senate
committee
activities,
but
it
is
not
a
greater
immunity.
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
having
said
this,
this
immunity
is
complete
if
it
applies
and
that
is
why
the
court
has
been
so
cheery
about
what
it
is
permitted
to
apply
to
and
i
agree
that
gravel
is
dispositive
and
with
that
i
would
like
to
conclude
my
argument
unless
there
is
any
further
question.
