mr.
easterbrook,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
time
spectrum,
will
you
pinpoint
just
when
it
was
that
mr.
brick
and
his
colleagues
came
into
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
want
you
to
pinpoint
is
on
the
day
that
this
was
handed
to
him
at
the
motel
in
kentucky,
what
was
the
status
of
the
three-judge
court
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
actually
physically
present
in
the
raid
in
the
dembrowski
case.
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
say
they
put
him
on
the
staff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
think
you
need
to
go
that
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
always
answer
if
you
want
in
this
court
as
counsel
often
does
that
when
you
get
that
case,
you
will
argue
it,
but
that
you
do
not
have
it
here.
i
have
done
it
in
your
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
fourth
amendment
violation
are
you
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
attributing
to
mr.
brick?
did
he
break
into
somebody’s
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
someone
handed
him
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
apply
when
senate
is
not
in
session
or
when
it
is
in
session?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
have
you
by
your
concession
what
mr.
sourwine's
actions
in
the
same
category
as
of
mr.
brick’s
actions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
easterbrook
we
will
allow
you
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
later.
we
will
enlarge
your
friend's
time
now
for
the
same
amount.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stavis,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
act
specifically
means
what,
what
are
you
referring
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
the
--
what
is
the
first
act,
what
is
the
initial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
receiving
them
from
the
state
authority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
letter
to
mr.
justice
stevens
mentioned
that
is
frequently
the
event
that
triggers
turning
over
material.
would
the
letter
have
the
same
status
as
the
subpoena
or
the
purposes
of
speech
or
debate
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
letter
of
that
kind
coming
from
a
committee
is
merely
a
polite
subpoena,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
committee
issues
a
subpoena
and
is
that
subject
to
a
challenge
as
being
unlawful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
committee
has
authorized
resolutions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
gentlemen
down
in
kentucky
instead
of
handing
this
material
to
mr.
brick,
had
wrapped
it
up
in
a
package
and
mailed
it
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
in
washington
and
he
received
it
and
opened
it
up
and
did
all
the
other
things,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
not
suggest
it
is
an
unlawful
act
to
open
your
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
any
different
whether
it
is
received
by
the
senator
or
one
of
the
staff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
when
mr.
brick
was
in
the
motel
room
and
the
local
prosecutor
brought
the
papers
over
to
him,
mr.
brick
had
with
him
a
newspaper
reporter
he
brought
along
from
washington
or
new
york
or
someone.
now
of
course,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
inhibit
that
second
man.
would
his
act
in
receiving
those
be
an
unlawful
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
it
is
an
unlawful
act
for
mr.
brick
to
receive
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
violation.
i
am
talking
about
what
you
were
referring
to
an
unlawful
act
under
state
law
in
the
early
part
of
your
argument
i
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1:00
for
mr.
easterbrook’s
rebuttal.[recess]
mr.
easterbrook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
understand
mr.
stavis
as
challenging,
his
saying
that
there
is
no
investigatory
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
were
to
hold
and
conclude
that
there
was
not
fourth
amendment
violation
here,
what
would
be
the
consequence
on
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
not
on
the
ground
was
he
at
the
time
and
place
of
the
delivery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
several
cases
to
announce
as
to
the
dispositions.
in
76-1621,
mcadams
against
mcsurely,
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
