justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
were
in
court
yesterday
night
when
my
brother
brennan
asked
counsel
to
the
proceeding
case
how
the
appeal
came
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
the
same
curiosity
here.
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
really
just
an
appeal
from
a
motion
for
denial
of
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
equated
it
to
a
kind
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
not
bound
of
course
by
the
party’s
stipulations
or
agreements
on
a
jurisdictional
platform?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
are
you
planning
to
go
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
complaint
stated
a
claim
for
relief?
the
reason
i
ask
you
that
is
i
read
from
part
of
judge
leventhal’s
opinion
and
from
part
of
judge
wilkie’s
opinion
that
all
they
were
treating
was
whether
or
not
the
complaint
states
a
claim
for
relief,
was
there
immunity
here
or
do
you
believe
the
two
are
so
in
extrapoly
intertwined
that
you
cannot
discuss
one
without
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
10
seem
to
agree
on
your
syllogism?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
senator
mccullen
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
is
sitting
in
his
office
in
the
senate
office
building
and
suddenly
realizes
that
he
has
left
some
important
information
out
of
his
house,
so
he
goes
out,
drives
out
to
his
house
and
in
the
course
of
driving
out
there,
negligently
runs
over
and
kills
somebody,
is
he
legislatively
immune?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook
to
use
the
pylons
of
the
law
review,
is
it
not
there
a
certain
tension
between
the
holding
liable
of
sourwine
and
dembrowski
and
the
gravel
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
mr.
stavis
that
all
we
have
here
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
speech
and
debate
clause
immunity,
assuming
that
the
plaintiff
complaint
stated
a
claim
for
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
do
not
pass
that
on
whether
the
complaint
stated
a
claim
for
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
distinguish
all
between
senator
mccullen
in
here
and
the
aides?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
was,
in
your
answer
to
my
brother
white
i
thought
that
was
precisely
what
you
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
can
you
separate
the
claim
for
relief
from
the
absolute
immunity
or
the
way
you
and
your
opponent
and
everybody
in
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
leventhal
too
though
discussed
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
since
gravel,
you
can
no
longer
distinguish
between
the
senator
and
his
aide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
should
not
dembrowski
against
eastland,
should
not
either
of
senator
eastland
not
have
been
held
liable
or
sourwine
have
gotten
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
say
that
dembrowski
against
eastland
did
not
even
involve
speech
and
debate
clause
immunity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
did
not
turn
on
the
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity?
if
he
was
not
involved,
he
does
not
need
speech
and
debate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
after
gravel,
it
would
not
protect
eastland
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stavis,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
core
of
legislative
activity,
is
there
some
difference
between
the
actions
of
a
committee
chairman
acting
on
behalf
of
a
committee
and
a
single
senator
acting
by
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
certainly
the
house
and
senate
act
much
more
through
committees
than
they
do,
i
mean,
they
play
--
committees
play
an
important
role
apart
from
the
votes
of
the
members
on
the
bills
before
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
exactly
why
i
asked
you
that
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
concede
something,
is
personal
liability
against
some
of
the
petitioners
being
sought
which
would
not
be
indemnified
by
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
applied
yourself
in
any
sort
of
a
conflict
position
then
when
you
concede
that
an
action
survived?
