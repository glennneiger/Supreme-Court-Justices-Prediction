how
far
does
that
argument
reasoning
take
you?
let
us
say
his
purposes
were
to
very
clearly
to
aid
the
legislative
process
by
aiding
the
congressional
committee
and
in
pursuant
of
that
pristinely
projected
purpose,
he
simply
burglarized
a
house
and
stole
things
out
of
a
locked
drawer
or
safe,
is
he
protected
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
for
that?
i
am
talking
by
he,
i
mean
an
aide
to
a
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
including
murder
i
suppose
or
maybe
not
?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
easterbrook,
you
said
the
controlling
factor
is
purpose
and
if
that
is
true,
then
that
case
is
here?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
mr.
easterbrook,
however,
was
hypothesized
upon
the
proposition
that
a
congressional
committee
was
considering
legislation
clearly
within
one
of
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress
under
the
constitution
under
article
1
of
the
constitution,
clearly,
specifically
delegated
to
congress,
involving
the
counting
of
money,
let
us
say
and
at
the
direction
of
the
committee
chairman,
a
member
of
the
committee
staff
in
pursuit
of
that
clearly
authorized
congressional
purpose,
broke
into
a
house,
killed
a
couple
of
people
and
broke
into
a
safe
to
get
information
clearly
relevant
to
the
inquiry
being
undertaken
by
the
committee
in
the
course
of
its
consideration
of
clearly
authorized
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
question
assumes
completely
and
concededly
clear
congressional
power,
legitimate
congressional
inquiry
in
connection
with
a
legislation
clearly
within
the
delegated
powers
of
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
no
summary
contempt
power?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
asked
for
it
and
it
is
turned
over
then
there
is
no
occasion
to
consider
the
speech
or
debate
clause
because
there
has
been
no
wrongdoing.
your
whole
argument
is
that
speech
and
debate
clause
only
needs
to
be
invoked
when
there
has
been
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
congressman
or
his
staff?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
are
you
not
conceding
for
the
purposes
--
conceding
that
there
was
wrongdoing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
immunity
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
argument
was
the
