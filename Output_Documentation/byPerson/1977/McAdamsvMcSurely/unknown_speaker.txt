unknown

he
went
out
to
kentucky
in
the
fall
of
1967?
unknown
speaker
prosecutor
and
the
--both
are
state
agents?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
question
as
to
at
whose
direction
he
had
made
that
trip
to
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
does
this
deal
with
dembrowski
against
eastland?
unknown
speaker
so
was
brick,
but
you
would
think
that
is
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
think
you
are
just
essentially
agreeing
judge
wilkie?
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
to
me
like
as
argument
there
was
no
colorable
violation?
unknown
speaker
not
very
appealing
in
any
other
way,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
suppose
it
has?
unknown
speaker
or
it
could
be
both?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
(voice
overlap)
attorney?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
they
would
apply
to
the
accident?
unknown
speaker
and
also
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
right?
unknown
speaker
oh!
it
has
been
a
very
interesting
tour.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
stavis,
if
you
are
right
that
the
immunity
that
stems
from
the
speech
and
debate
clause
is
applicable
only
when
there
has
been
no
violation
of
law
state
or
federal
then
it
is
a
meaningless
immunity,
you
do
not
need
it?
unknown
speaker
what
was
said
in
gravel
who
claimed
that
gravel,
the
senator
committed
a
crime
in
releasing
materials
and
he
was
immune?
unknown
speaker
he
lost
on
the
next
--
unknown
speaker
in
dembrowski,
in
the
long
run,
sourwine
was
on
his
own,
he
had
not
been
ordered
to
do
it
or
authorized
to
do
anything
here?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event
it
is
conceded
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
by
the
government
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
here.
unknown
speaker
what
(voice
overlap)
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
are
any
of
these
defendants
still
living?
unknown
speaker
both
the
senator
is
deceased
andâ€¦
unknown
speaker
what
part
allegedly
did
the
only
living
defendant
play
into
this?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
we
do
not
have
a
course
here
in
the
issue
of
the
survival
of
these
actions?
unknown
speaker
but
is
has
occurred
to
me
that
you
may
be
asking
us
to
decide
an
academic
question,
if
these
actions
do
not
survive?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
mrs.
mccullen
or
at
least
derivatively
she,
the
estate
of
the
senator,
she
or
whoever
the
beneficiaries
are
of
that
estate
and
you
have
considered
would
be
liable?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
his
liability
if
any
is
asserted
on
quite
a
different
ground,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
not
with
respect
to
the
