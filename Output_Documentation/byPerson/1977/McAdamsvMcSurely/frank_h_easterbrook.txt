mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
because
10
judges
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
divided
five
to
five
on
the
question
whether
there
was
more
than
merely
colorable
substance
to
an
allegation
that
john
brick,
a
senate
investigator
violated
respondent’s
rights
when
he
took
copies
of
some
of
their
papers
in
1967.
we
do
not
pursue
here
the
question
that
divided
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argue
instead
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
bars
respondent’s
suit
whether
or
not
brick
erred.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
your
honor.
the
original
panel
that
heard
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
wrote
several
pages
explaining
why
this
was
an
interlocutory
order
within
the
meaning
of
cohen
against
beneficial
finance.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
equated
it
–
they
essentially
followed
the
analysis
of
this
court
followed
in
abney,
that
is
that
since
the
speech
or
debate
clause
creates
a
right
not
to
be
questioned
in
any
other
place,
and
since
the
process
of
discovery
in
trial
is
the
kind
of
questioning
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
forbids,
if
it
applies
here.
then
there
is
a
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
have
that
question
resolved
before
discovery
and
trial.
the
en
banc
court
adopted
that
and
we
do
not
understand
that
respondent’s
dispute
of
that
analysis.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
of
course
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
think
it
does
follow
from
abney.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
probably
not,
your
honor,
not
at
this
stage
and
indeed
that
was
the
basis
of
our
appeal.
this
case
grew
out
of
the
1967
seizure
of
respondent’s
papers
by
kentucky
officials.
respondents
have
not
contended
that
the
federal
government
or
the
congress
played
any
role
in
the
initial
seizure.
after
the
seizure,
a
three-judge
district
court
declared
unconstitutional
the
kentucky
statute
pursuant
to
which
the
seizure
had
been
made
and
it
entered
an
order
which
i
will
call
the
safekeeping
order,
directing
the
kentucky
state’s
attorney
to
keep
custody
of
the
documents.
a
senate
subcommittee
was
then
investigating
urban
riots.
it
acquired
information
that
appeared
to
indicate
that
respondents
had
pertinent
information
and
john
brick,
the
senate
investigator
went
to
kentucky
to
investigate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
three-judge
district
court
litigation
concerned
the
constitutionality
of
the
kentucky
sedition
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
held
it
was
unconstitutional
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
entered
an
order,
it
entered
a
custody
order.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
dispute
in
this
litigation
about
what
that
custody
order
meant
which
i
do
not
intend
to
pursue
here,
but
that
order
was
pending
on
appeal
or
any
further
proceedings.
a
number
of
further
proceedings
although
not
an
appeal
ensued,
including
an
attempt
to
subpoena
the
documents
while
they
were
held
in
mr.
raleigh’s
custody.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
attempt
by
the
senate
subcommittee
to
subpoena
the
documents.
that
was
resisted
by
respondents
and
several
stays
were
entered
by
this
court
on
appeal
that
was
an
attempt
to
block
the
subpoena
which
this
court
eventually
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
an
appeal
then
went
into
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
held
that
the
district
court’s
custody
order
should
have
expired
once
the
time
for
appeal
had
lapsed.
the
papers
were
then
returned
to
the
respondents
without
prejudice
to
the
enforcement
of
the
subpoena
against
respondents
and
they
were
then
served
with
a
subpoena.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
the
complaint
that
was
originally
filed
by
respondents
challenged
not
only
the
fact
that
brick
looked
at
the
documents
and
took
copies
of
them
back
to
washington.
it
also
contended
that
the
senate
subcommittee
subpoena
was
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights,
that
the
procuring
of
a
citation
for
contempt
of
congress
was
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
for
which
they
could
recover
damages
and
there
were
a
very
large
number
of
other
allegations
essentially
challenging
the
entire
course
of
conduct
both
in
the
three-judge
district
court
and
before
the
senate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
brick
came
into
possession
of
the
234
copies
in
the
fall
of
1967
and
they
were
immediately
taken
back
to
washington.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
and
he
was
given
in
his
motel
room
copies
of
234
documents
by
the
prosecutor
and
by
mr.
scott,
the
county
detective.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
he
was
then
allowed
to
look
at
the
originals
which
were
then
held
in
a
vault
pursuant
to
the
safekeeping
order.
he
was
not
allowed
to
copy
any
of
the
originals
and
did
not.
what
he
took
back
to
washington
with
him
were
the
234
copies
that
were
given
to
him
in
his
motel
room.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
had
made
the
trip
to
kentucky
at
the
direction
of
senator
mccullen
and
the
staff
counsel
of
the
subcommittee,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
on
the
day
that
it
was
handed
to
him
at
his
motel
in
kentucky,
the
three-judge
district
court
had
already
entered
an
order
enjoining
the
state
prosecution,
relying
on
debrowski
against
pfister
as
the
authority
for
the
injunction.
the
the
time
for
–
the
final
time
for
appeal
of
that
order
had
not
been
expired
and
there
had
been
no
alteration
in
the
safekeeping
order
which
had
been
entered
earlier.
the
safekeeping
order
was
entered
i
believe
on
september
14,
1967.
mr.
brick
paid
his
visit
on
october
8
and
october
9,
1967.
he
then
returned
on
october
16,
1967
with
a
subpoena
which
was
--
with
several
subpoenas
which
were
served
on
ratcliffe,
the
custodian
on
the
united
states
marshall
and
on
the
mcsurelys.
those
subpoenas
eventually
led
to
the
state
proceedings
in
this
court.
after
the
documents
were
finally
returned,
after
the
sixth
circuit
had
ordered
that
they
be
returned,
a
new
subpoena
was
served
on
the
mcsurelys
and
they
were
called
before
congress
personally
to
the
subpoena
and
refused
either
to
testify
or
to
produce
the
documents.
they
were
cited
for
contempt
of
congress
and
they
were
convicted.
that
conviction
was
reversed.
the
ground
for
reversal
was
that
the
subpoena
was
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
the
tree
was
poisonous,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
because
the
initial
search
was
conducted
pursuant
to
an
over
broad
warrant.
the
warrant
which
appears
in
page
76
of
the
appendix,
authorized
state
detective
to
search
the
mcsurely’s
home
and
find
therein
any
seditious
literature
and
seize
the
same.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
quite
correctly
that
that
was
over
broad
because
it
did
not
specify
what
was
to
be
seized.
meanwhile,
on
the
same
day
they
appeared
before
the
senate
subcommittee
pursuant
to
the
subpoena,
respondents
filed
this
suit
seeking
damages
for
alleged
violations
of
their
rights.
the
complaint
as
amended
named
senator
mccullen,
brick,
ratcliffe
and
two
senate
employees
as
defendants.
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
the
complaint
seven
categories
of
alleged
wrong,
covering
the
entire
course
of
conduct
through
the
issuance
of
the
subpoenas
and
the
citations
for
contempt
of
congress.
only
two
of
those
categories
concern
us
here.
on
the
other
five,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
bars
any
action
by
respondents
and
they
have
not
filed
a
cross
petition
from
that
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
further
proceedings,
including
discovery
and
perhaps
trial
with
respect
to
two
types
of
activity.
the
first
is
brick’s
looking
at
and
taking
to
washington
the
234
copies
without
first
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
the
second
is
the
allegation
that
the
subcommittee
disseminated
some
or
all
of
the
234
copies
to
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
because
the
first
question
concerning
brick’s
activities
presents
the
most
difficult
problems,
i
intend
to
discuss
only
those
problems
during
oral
argument
unless
time
permits.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
of
appeals
found
them
to
be
essentially
the
same
question
and
i
think
that
is
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
but
i
think
it
is
easier
to
answer
that
question
if
i
can
set
up
first
what
i
see
is
the
way
both
judge
wilkie
and
judge
leventhal
approached
the
question
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
employed
a
three-step
syllogism
and
it
ran
like
this.
first,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
activities
that
are
essential
to
legislating.
second,
the
employment
of
unlawful
means
is
not
essential
to
legislating.
third,
therefore
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
extend
to
cases
in
which
a
colorable
claim
of
unlawful
conduct
is
made.
the
10
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
then
divided
equally
on
the
question
whether
a
colorable
claim
of
wrongdoing
had
been
made
out.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
all
10
followed
that
syllogism,
i
believe.
we
start
from
the
same
premise
that
is
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protects
activities
that
are
essential
to
legislating,
but
our
course
thereafter
is
significantly
different
from
that
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
gathering
information
as
part
of
an
inquiry
into
a
subject
on
which
legislation
could
be
had
is
essential
to
legislating.
we
believe
that
servicemen’s
fund
held
at
least
that
much.
brick
was
concededly
gathering
information
as
part
of
an
inquiry
into
a
subject
on
which
legislation
could
be
had.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
agreed
with
that
proposition.
we
conclude
from
this
that
because
brick
was
engaged
in
an
activity
leading
potentially
to
legislation,
that
his
activities
in
general
are
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
the
fact
that
he
erred,
that
is
that
he
may
have
used
unlawful
means
or
violated
the
fourth
amendment
in
obtaining
access
to
the
documents
is
therefore
not
relevant.
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
statement
of
the
cause
of
action
in
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
question
are
really
quite
separate.
after
all,
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
exists
only
to
erect
a
shield
against
charges
of
wrong
doing,
even
constitutional
wrongdoing
as
this
court
said
in
doe.
an
immunity
that
protects
only
when
no
wrong
has
been
committed
would
be
no
immunity
at
all.
we
take
the
court
of
appeals
to
hold
that
the
immunity
is
dissipated
by
a
colorable
claim
of
wrongdoing.
that
is
the
same
thing
as
abolishing
the
immunity.
because
otherwise,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
would
be
granted
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals
in
other
words
has
held
that
the
immunity
pertains
only
when
the
complaint
would
have
been
dismissed
on
its
face.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
dembrowski
against
eastland,
your
honor,
involves
--
first
it
is
necessary
i
believe
to
separate
the
holdings
of
dembrowski.
there
were
two
allegations
of
wrong
doing
in
dembrowski.
the
first
was
that
committee
counsel,
sourwine
had
taken
part
in
an
illegal
raid
by
state
officers.
the
second
was
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
was
your
honor.
the
second
is
that
the
committee,
including
sourwine
-
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
it
is
quite
different.
in
dembrowski
after
the
state
raid,
sourwine
and
the
committee,
including
senator
eastland
then
according
to
the
complaint,
took
over
the
documents
that
had
been
seized
in
the
raid
for
use
by
the
senate
subcommittee.
with
respect
to
the
takeover
allegations,
this
court
held
that
speech
or
debate
immunity
was
absolute
and
that
there
was
no
liability.
this
we
believe
is
a
takeover
case.
the
raid
took
place
without
the
presence
of
brick.
the
documents
were
then
taken
over
out
of
the
hands
of
mr.
ratcliffe
by
the
senate
subcommittee
for
use
by
the
senate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
made
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
did
not
press
it
here
because
we
think
that
there
is
solid
immunity
whether
or
not
there
was
a
colorable
violation.
but
essentially
our
approach
rests
on
the
contention
that
the
immunity
is
triggered
by
the
purposes
of
the
activity
in
which
the
senator
or
the
senate
aide
was
engaged.
we
believe
that
this
approach
is
consistent
with
and
indeed
required
by
the
considerations
that
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
constitutional
privilege.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
question
raises
a
number
of
complexities
and
my
answer
to
it
ultimately
is
yes,
probably,
he
is
protected.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
too
falls
within
my
yes
probably
answer,
but
i
would
like
if
i
can,
this
one,
the
answer
is
not
intuitively
appealing
i
must
concede.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
alright,
that
of
course
is
not
this
case.
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
the
mafia
member
was
a
senate
aide.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
the
answer
might
be
that
he
is
not
a
proper
senate
employee,
and
therefore,
the
question
does
not
arise,
but
i
would
like
mr.
justice
stewart…
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
would
hope
that
the
senate
would
have
the
good
sense
not
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
in
that
event,
the
speech
or
debate
protection
applies,
but
i
would
--
before
i
continue
along
this
string
of
answers
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
marshall,
before
i
continue
along
these
string
of
answers,
i
think
i
ought
to
develop
the
background
that
led
me
to
this
answer.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
although
i
am
being
pressed
to
go
that
far
by
members
of
this
court,
but
i
would
like
to
present
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
none
of
those
hypotheticals
is
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white
and
i
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
agree.
i
think
i
have
to
deal
with
that
implication
of
my
argument,
but
i
would
like
to
start
at
the
beginning
if
i
might.
the
question
of
deliberate
use
of
force
or
the
question
of
deliberate
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
i
think
the
most
difficult
case
for
the
arguments
that
we
are
making.
the
question
poses
a
palpable
abuse
of
power.
that
is
it's
assumption
and
it
is
always
hard,
i
suppose
to
defend
palpable
abuses
of
power,
but
not
all
cases
are
that
clear.
the
problem
of
sorting
abuses,
even
palpable
abuses
from
ordinary
mistakes
and
the
problem
of
sorting
ordinary
mistakes
from
things
that
are
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
always
easy,
particularly
when
dealing
with
a
concept
like
reasonableness.
the
purpose
of
the
immunity,
one
of
the
major
purposes
of
the
immunity
is
to
deal
with
the
sorting
process
itself
as
well
as
with
the
liability
for
the
end
result
once
the
sorting
process
has
been
completed.
the
process
of
litigation
and
of
determining
whether
this
was
such
an
intentional
abuse,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
one
of
the
things
to
which
the
speech
or
debate
clause
was
most
closely
directed.
a
claim
of
palpable
abuse
can
be
made
in
pleadings
or
by
plaintiffs,
but
may
prove
to
be
false
and
the
process
of
trying
the
facts
may
be
difficult
and
time
consuming.
moreover
an
apparent
violation
may
turn
out
to
be
quite
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
court’s
cases
show
that
quite
often,
take
for
example
the
claim
that
someone’s
house
was
searched
without
a
warrant
which
is
at
least
on
its
face
and
presumptively
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
may
turn
out
that
the
defense
has
exigent
circumstances
and
that
requires
extremely
time
consuming
and
complicated
litigation
in
many
cases
just
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
violation.
even
so,
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
argument
for
immunity
is
an
argument
for
indulgence.
it
asks
for
forbearance
rather
than
approval.
the
claim
does
not
and
cannot
have
any
error
of
just
treatment
to
it.
yet
the
framers
decided
that
forbearance
is
the
better
course
and
that
error
is
not
a
reason
to
overcome
the
immunity.
to
the
contrary,
the
fact
that
error
is
inevitable,
that
some
men
are
wicked
and
that
grievances
are
plentiful,
it
is
the
reason
why
there
is
immunity.
this
shows
we
think
that
the
allegation
of
even
a
blatant
violation
cannot
lightly
pierce
the
immunity,
but
our
answer
does
not
stop
there
to
your
problem.
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart
assumes
intentional
misconduct.
yet
the
speech
or
debate
clause
forbids
scrutiny
of
intent,
of
the
subjective
intent
of
the
actor.
servicemen’s
fund
said
that
at
pages
508
to
509.
this
court
said
so
in
the
johnson
case.
it
said
so
in
tenny
against
branhoe
of
the
common
law
variant
of
state
legislator’s
immunity.
therefore,
it
is
difficult
to
treat
your
hypothetical
as
a
case
in
which
intent
can
be
proved
because
it
cannot
be
proved.
we
must
treat
it
for
present
purposes
as
an
unintentional
but
apparently
very
serious
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
otherwise,
the
rule
simply
invites
plaintiffs
to
charge
intent
and
pierce
the
immunity.
for
this
consideration
too,
counsels
against
easily
allowing
trials
of
claims
of
intentional
misconduct,
but
beyond
that
we
think
the
claim
of
intentional
misconduct
requires
consideration
of
two
questions.
first
is
the
question
which
we
think
is
dispositive
here
whether
the
activity
viewed
objectively
was
part
of
a
legislative
inquiry.
the
second
question
and
the
one
that
led
me
to
answer
your
question
yes,
probably
is
whether
article
1
of
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
conduct
such
an
inquiry,
that
is
whether
what
happened
was
part
of
the
legislative
business.
we
think
clearly
that
this
case
involves
the
first
of
these
questions.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
brick
was
conducting
a
legislative
inquiry.
for
this
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
the
legislative
inquiry
question,
it
should
make
no
difference
how
serious
the
fourth
amendment
violation
was.
if
the
investigation
seen
objectively
was
directed
toward
legislation
then
the
immunity
is
absolute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
not
and
as
we
have
said,
we
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
fourth
amendment
violation
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
argued
and
we
still
argue
that
that
is
simply
a
turnover
of
documents.
it
is
very
similar
to
a
turnover
of
documents
from
someone,
a
private
person
who
seized
them
wrongfully
and
then
turned
them
over
to
the
federal
government
in
which
this
court
has
held
in
bordeaux
against
mcdowell
that
there
is
no
seizure
at
all.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
or
judge
leventhal
said
with
respect
to
that
question,
is
that
this
is
decisively
different
from
the
bordeaux
and
similar
line
of
cases
because
of
the
safekeeping
order
entered
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
we
would
have
thought
ordinarily
that
the
violation
of
something
like
the
safekeeping
order
is
contempt
of
court
other
than
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
could
be
both
or
it
could
be
simply
an
actionable
common
law
tort.
there
is
the
possibility
that
under
district
of
columbia
or
kentucky
law,
there
is
a
common
law
tort
lurking
in
the
background
of
this
case.
that
is
the
reason
why
we
elected
not
to
make
strongly
here
any
arguments
about
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
precisely
because
there
may
be
allegations
of
other
bases
of
liability
based
on
common
law.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
probably
not.
he
was
engaged
in
ultimately
something
with
a
legislative
purpose,
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
the
driving
was
itself
part
of
that
inquiry.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
that
is
a
privilege
against
arrest.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
probably
not
apply
to
the
accident,
but
i
would
prefer
not
to
try
to
parse
that
constitutional
provision
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
know
mr.
chief
justice.
the
final
part
of
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
however,
and
the
reason
for
the
qualification
probably
is
that
the
scope
of
congress’
powers
under
article
1
is
considerably
more
difficult.
those
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
not
protect
particular
activities,
have
essentially
been
cases
in
which
the
court
concluded
that
that
activity
was
none
of
congress’
business.
in
the
killborn
case
in
which
the
sergeant
at
arms
of
the
house
went
out
and
made
an
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
a
witness
into
testifying,
the
conclusion
of
this
court
was
that
congress
had
no
summary
contempt
powers.
that
is
that
it
was
attempting
to
exercise
powers
committed
by
the
constitution
to
the
judicial
branch.
in
the
gravel
case
and
the
doe
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
did
not
apply
to
publicity,
the
holding
was
that
the
article
1
power
of
congress
did
not
include
a
power
to
publicize
information
for
the
sake
of
publicity.
in
powell
against
mccormick,
where
it
held
that
the
speech
or
debate
immunity
did
not
bar
representative
powell’s
attempts
to
get
back
in
the
house.
the
conclusion
was
that
article
1
of
the
constitution
did
not
authorize
the
exclusion
of
a
duly
elected
member
except
for
the
three
qualifications
explicitly
stated
in
article
1.
all
of
those
cases
are
cases
essentially
holding
that
congress
was
engaged
in
a
pursuit
that
exceeded
the
authorization
given
it
by
article
1.
for
that
purpose
too,
we
think,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
somebody
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
part
of
article
1
and
it
does
not
tell
you
how
far
congress
can
go
or
for
what
purpose.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
am
sorry
to
have
taken
so
long
to
get
to
my
answer,
but
the
reason
why
i
had
to
qualify
my
yes
with
a
probably
was
because
that
was
the
case
in
killborn.
in
killborn,
the
reason
for
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
understand
that,
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
congressional
power
that
i
think
had
to
be
distinguished.
one
is
the
kind
about
which
you
were
taking
and
about
which
i
think
is
dispositive
in
this
case
because
it
is
also
present.
the
second
is
the
power
to
engage
in
the
activity
to
fulfill
its
power
and
that
is
why
we
have
the
problem
with
killborn
in
which
congress
was
engaged
in
gathering
information
for
legislation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
had
no
summary
contempt
power
and
that
is
why
we
get
to
the
problem.
it
is
conceivable
that
congress
has
the
power
to
ask
for
information
within
article
1,
but
not
to
take
it
by
force
so
that
if
that
is
a
limitation
of
congress’
power
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
unfortunately
this
is
a
case
in
which
congress
asked
for
something.
it
was
turned
over
and
the
lower
court
has
held
that
nevertheless
there
is
probably
wrongdoing,
so
i
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
conceding
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
it
was
actionable
in
some
way.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
we
are
conceding
for
purposes
of
this
argument.
but
the
qualification
i
had
to
put
on
my
yes
answer
which
i
think
is
a
sound
yes
answer
for
the
reasons
that
i
discussed
before
i
got
to
this
qualification
is
that
it
is
at
least
conceivable
that
congress’
power
under
article
1
is
only
the
power
to
ask
and
not
the
power
to
take
so
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
since
it
clearly
has
the
power
to
ask
and
servicemen’s
fund
said
that
it
had
the
power
to
ask,
there
is
no
question.
but
if
the
question
about
the
power
to
take
arises,
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
to
litigate
whether
that
is
within
the
scope
of
our
article
1
and
that
is
reason
for
my
qualification
probably
has
taken.
i
am
sorry
it
is
much
too
long
to
get
there.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
mr.
justice
powell
i
can
now,
having
answered
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
distinguish
it
in
two
ways.
one
is
that
the
underlying
activity
in
dembrowski
in
which
counsel
sourwine
engaged,
that
is
participating
in
the
state
raid
was
we
think
not
an
activity
within
the
congress’
power
in
view
of
article
i.
congress
has
no
legislative
power
to
help
states
gather
information
for
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
that
mr.
sourwine’s
actions
are
in
the
category
of
mr.
ratcliffe’s
actions
here.
that
is
mr.
sourwine’s
actions
in
participating
in
the
raid
are
the
same
as
mr.
ratcliffe’s
actions.
the
second
thing
mr.
sourwine
did
was
then
take
over
the
documents
and
carry
them
back
to
the
committee.
in
that
respect
mr.
sourwine
was
acting
just
like
mr.
brick
and
as
to
that
allegation
the
takeover
of
this
court
held
in
dembrowski
that
there
was
absolute
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity.
so
we
think
ultimately
then
dembrowski
is
a
case
that
supports
our
position
and
indeed
is
probably
our
strongest
precedent,
but
that
is
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
there
is,
the
dissenters
in
the
gravel
case
said
that,
but
i
think
that
is
the
tension
that
may
persist.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
white,
we
acknowledge
that
that
is
what
the
gravel
case
said.
we
think
it
was
based
on
the
killborn
and
on
the
portion
of
dembrowski
the
participation
in
the
raid
that
were
not
protected
by
the
clause
because
they
were
outside
congress’
article
i
power.
to
the
extent
it
had
any
broader
meaning
we
think
that
language
is
simply
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
subsequent
holding
in
the
eastland
against
servicemen’s
fund,
and
therefore,
we
would
rely
on
eastland
rather
on
a
dicta
in
that
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
did
not
present
that
question
in
the
certiorari
petition.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
needs
to
decide
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
simply
do
not
rely
on
the
main
arguments
made
by
judge
wilkie.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
point
of
respondents
during
oral
argument
was
that
whatever
may
be
the
case
for
situations
in
which
a
subpoena
has
been
issued,
congress
has
no
general
investigative
authority.
we
believe
that
that
distinction
is
incorrect.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
within
the
power
of
article
1.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
the
two
are
the
same.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
let
me
start
with
the
premise
that
this
court
started
with
in
servicemen’s
fund
which
is
that
congress
must
have
the
power
to
investigate
or
it
would
be
unable
intelligently
to
pass
legislation.
if
it
cannot
find
out
the
facts,
it
simply
cannot
know
how
best
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
nation.
so
the
fact
finding
process
is
essential
to
the
functions
of
congress.
their
work
simply
cannot
go
on
without
it
and
that
was
the
foundation
for
this
court’s
holding
in
servicemen’s
fund,
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
provides
absolute
immunity
for
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
stavis
seems
to
contend
i
think
that
there
is
no
informal
investigatory
power.
it
is
only
when
done
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
at
a
hearing.
we
believe
that
that
cannot
be
correct.
the
purpose
of
a
subpoena
is
to
provide
compulsory
process
for
congress.
that
is
it
compels
someone
to
respond
in
a
particular
way
on
pane
of
law
for
disobedience,
but
it
would
be
very
odd
we
think
to
say
that
congress
has
the
power
within
the
scope
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
to
obtain
information
only
when
it
finds
it
necessary
to
compel
that
information
from
the
hands
of
persons
who
may
be
unwilling
to
supply
it.
it
may
be
just
as
appropriate
and
certainly
as
much
within
the
legislative
power
to
obtain
information
from
persons
who
are
willing
suppliers
of
information
whether
that
information
is
necessary
for
legislating
or
whether
that
information
proves
to
be
necessary
on
which
to
issue
a
subpoena,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
happened
here.
there
was
not
need
to
compel
the
documents
from
the
hands
of
ratcliffe.
ratcliffe
was
willing
to
supply
them.
we
think
it
would
be
an
inversion
of
the
proper
ordering
of
interests
to
say
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
provides
immunity,
only
when
congress
found
it
necessary
to
use
compulsion.
but
more
than
that
the
question
whether
to
use
compulsory
process
or
to
use
some
more
informal
method
is
fundamentally
within
the
discretion
of
congress.
to
say
that
only
a
subpoena
is
within
the
scope
of
protection
essentially
tells
congress
how
to
go
about
its
information
gathering
function,
a
function,
an
essential
one,
that
this
court
has
held
that
it
has.
ultimately,
the
harm
to
persons
like
respondents
is
the
same
whether
the
information
is
secured
by
subpoena
or
by
simple
oral
request.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
has
held
that
in
response
to
a
contempt
citation,
he
can
litigate
whether
that
was
within
the
authority
of
congress.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor
they
do
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
in
much
the
same
way,
some
of
congress’
statutes
are
good
and
some
are
not
as
this
court
sits
deciding
whether
statutes
that
are
passed
were
constitutional
within
their
power,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
process
of
getting
to
the
statute
is
defective
in
any
way.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
it
raises
once
more
the
discussion
i
had
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
and
about
the
question
whether
article
1
provides
to
congress
the
power
to
take
things
by
force.
but
the
second
answer
is
that
there
is
also
a
problem
of
distinguishing
between
what
it
should
do
and
what
the
remedy
is
for
it
not
doing
that.
we
may
assume
that
congress
should
not
send
someone
to
take
it
by
force,
that
it
is
wrong
for
congress
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
illegally
or
by
force,
but
i
am
willing
to
accept
by
force
here.
we
may
assume
that
it
is
wrong
for
congress
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
but
our
response
is
that
the
remedy
lies
in
congress’
discipline
of
its
own
members
and
in
the
public’s
discipline
of
congress
rather
than
in
discipline
by
the
judicial
branch
of
congress’
errors.
that
ultimately
is
our
position.
i
would
like
to
address
for
a
moment
mr.
justice
stevens,
your
question
about
the
gravel
case,
about
the
source
of
the
documents.
it
is
true
that
the
legislative
aide
in
gravel
could
be
questioned
about
the
source
of
the
documents.
we
think
that
is
so
for
the
same
reason
the
court
held
that
the
publication
of
the
pentagon
papers
was
no
privileged.
that
is
the
essential
holding
of
that
case
is
generating
publicity
for
its
own
sake
is
not
something
that
is
within
congress’
powers
under
article
1.
therefore,
the
obtaining
of
that
document
for
that
purpose
was
not
a
legislative
act,
and
therefore,
the
immunity
did
not
apply,
but
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
brick
was
attempting
to
gather
information
for
the
purpose
of
legislation
so
that
his
activities
are
a
legislative
act
and
this
is
therefore
quite
a
different
case
from
gravel.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
if
there
were
no
fourth
amendment
violation,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
complaint
dismissed
although
we
have
not
raised
that
issue
which
was
the
subject
of
judge
wilkie’s
opinion.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
justice
powell,
we
have
raised
a
subsidiary
argument
about
vicarious
liability
that
we
believe
you
can
accept
without
addressing
our
principle
argument.
our
argument
about
vicarious
liability
is
that
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
have
not
waived
it.
we
believe
very
firmly
that
it
is
correct.
i
just
did
not
have
time
to
cover
it.
we
argued
it
in
our
brief
and
we
continue
to
argue
it
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
not.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
of
the
defendants,
donald
f.
o’donnell
who
was
the
chief
counsel
of
the
subcommittee
is
still
living.
the
other
three
defendants
are
deceased.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
alderman
died
in
1975
and
mr.
brick,
the
investigator
died
in
1973.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
was
alleged
to
have
participated
in
a
conspiracy
with
the
other
defendants
to
carry
out
these
acts,
the
complaint
and
the
affidavits
of
the
respondents
are
completely
nonspecific
on
that
question.
we
simply
do
not
know
what
role
he
played.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
was
not
in
kentucky
at
any
point.
one
of
our
principle
arguments
in
respect
to
him
is
the
argument
about
vicarious
liability.
he
is
simply
being
asked
to
answer
for
the
misdeeds
of
brick
assuming
that
brick
had
any
misdeeds.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not.
the
court
of
appeals
reserved
decision
on
that
question
and
essentially
asked
the
district
court
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
they
do
not
survive,
the
question
that
remains
open
it
would
be
an
academic
question.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
after
the
deaths,
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
united
states
for
its
views
and
we
conceded
that
as
a
matter
law,
the
actions
survive
the
deaths.
we
have
since
argued
that
although
they
survived,
it
was
necessary
for
the
mcsurelys
to
attempt
to
substitute
the
estates
of
the
survivors.
the
mcsurelys
did
not
do
so
until
august
1977.
we
have
argued
that
that
caused
the
actions
to
abate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
it
would
require
a
private
bill
to
indemnify
for
these
cases
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
consulted
with
our
clients
before
making
our
concession.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
we
conceded
that
in
behalf
of
the
estates
of
alderman
and
o’donnell.
after
senator
mccullen
died,
we
consulted
with
his
estate
and
his
estate
asked
us
to
reserve
that
point
on
his
behalf
and
in
our
motion
to
substitute
the
estate
for
the
senator
to
be
explicitly
reserved
at
that
point
and
we
believe
that
it
is
open
for
further
litigation
in
lower
courts
if
that
should
prove
necessary,
but
there
is
one
very
live
defendant
still.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
asserted
on
the
general
ground
of
conspiracy
with
the
others
and
we
believe
it
is
asserted
on
the
same
ground
as
to
him
as
it
is
asserted
with
respect
to
senator
mccullen.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
brick’s
liability
to
stand
on
a
different
--
yes,
your
honor.
