especially
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
a
colorable
claim
here
that
there
was
deliberate
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
in
short
a
deliberate
theft
of
the
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
where
--
and
you
say
that
even
if
it
were
tried
out
and
proved
that
he
engaged
in
a
deliberate
theft,
he
is
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand
gravel
said
that
neither
the
senators
nor
their
aides
to
be
immune
from
liability
of
question
in
such
circumstances,
namely
it
is
a
carry
out
of
illegal
arrest
or
in
order
to
secure
information
themselves
seize
the
property?

byron

i
thought
you
just
said
that
investigation
is

within
the
legislative

byron
r.
white
you
mean
investigative
authority
that
is
within
the

justice
byron
r.

well,
that
is
within
the
speech
or
debate.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
if
materials
are
subpoenaed
and
the
person
does
not
respond,
he
is
entitled
to
litigate
whether
congress
may
secure
the
documents
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
sit
on
that
sort
of
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
suggest
to
congress
that
perhaps
some
of
the
subpoenas
are
good
and
some
are
not?
