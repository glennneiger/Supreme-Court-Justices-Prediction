justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
conclude
would
you
comeback
to
dembrowski,
it
would
seem
to
me
on
its
face
it
would
undercut
your
argument
in
senate
to
some
extent,
you
distinguished
it
very
briefly
but
would
you
go
over
it
again
for
me
please?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
should
disagree
with
your
principle
argument,
what
issue
if
any
would
remain
for
us
to
address?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
suggesting
you
go
into
it.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
have
not
waived
it?
