justice
john
paul
stevens
under
that
ration
--
the
abney
rationale,
could
we
consider
any
kind
of
immunity
claim
other
than
one
predicated
squarely
on
the
speech
and
debate
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
again
what
the
first
district
court
litigation
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
held
it
as
unconstitutional
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
an
auxiliary
to
that,
it
entered
the
sequestration
order,
custody
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whose
attempt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
happened
in
this
case
happened
during
the
life
of
the
custody
order,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook
before
you
sit
down,
i
am
not
quite
clear
on
what
he
government’s
position
is
on
whether
we
should
decide
whether
these
complaints
stated
claim
for
relief
against
a
different
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
rely,
in
other
words
you
do
not
rely
at
all
on
the
arguments
you
may
raise
below
that
the
claim
complaints
are
in
any
event
insufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stavis
are
you
conceding
when
you
emphasize
the
critical
effect
that
if
senator
mccullen
had
caused
a
subpoena
to
be
served
on
ratcliffe,
the
custodian
of
the
papers
and
pursuant
to
that
subpoena,
they
had
been
turned
over
to
brick
and
brick
had
made
234
copies
and
taken
it
back,
you
would
have
no
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
it
was
a
critical
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
did
not
say
anything
about
what
it
could
do
about
refusing
to
turn
the
documents
over
and
resisting
a
contempt
citation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
case
that
i
am
hypothesizing
is
the
one
in
which
perhaps
you
did
not
find
out
about
the
subpoena
because
the
senator
just
signed
a
subpoena
and
brick
took
it
down
to
ratcliffe
and
said
turnover
the
documents
and
be
done
so.
would
you
concede
that
that
immunity
would
apply
that
is
what
i
am
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
are
making
up
to
a
position
that
the
subpoena
is
critical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
first
of
all
we
are
just
concerned
here
with
the
liability
of
the
senator
and
his
aides,
not
with
what
could
have
been
done
by
way
of
(voice
overlap)
and
as
you
know
sometimes
committees
proceed
by
subpoena,
sometimes
they
write
a
formal
letter.
the
chairman
write
a
letter
to
mr.
ratcliffe
and
say
we
like
to
see
these
documents
and
say
armed
with
such
a
letter
if
brick
had
gone
down
would
he
be
just
as
been
in
a
stronger
position
as
if
he
had
a
subpoena?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
know
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
submission
must
be
that
unless
you
are
going
to
talk
about
--
unless
you
are
talking
about
a
committee
hearing
or
a
subpoena
just
to
investigation
generally
in
the
field
just
is
not
an
essential
part
of
the
legislative
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
must
say
that
just
field
investigators
must
obey
the
law
whether
it
is
the
law
of
trespass
or
it
is
the
law
of
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
like
the
fbi
doing
whatever
the
prosecutors
asked
him
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
what
would
you
say
if
the
senator
received
a
stolen
property
that
was
very
relevant
he
thought
to
his
investigation.
i
suppose
it
is
just
the
possession
of
it
would
not
make
him
criminally
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
was
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
evidence,
it
is
evidence.
well,
say
it
is
a
writing
that
is
very
relevant
to
the
legislative
process
and
he
received
it.
the
only
thing
it
was
a
stolen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
a
senator
subpoenaed
some
writings
in
the
hands
of
somebody
and
they
just
happen
to
be
stolen
and
they
produce
them
would
the
receipt
of
them
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
after
gravel,
if
the
senator
had
done
what
sourwine
had
done…
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stavis,
let
me
interrupt
with
something
that
--
i
am
not
sure,
maybe
you
have
argued
it,
but
i
missed
it
if
you
have.
in
the
gravel
case,
the
court
held
that
the
aide,
rodberg
i
guess
his
name
was
could
be
examined
by
the
grand
jury
about
the
source
of
the
pentagon
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
not
a
holding
and
that
i
would
assume
would
be
information
gathering
activity
by
the
senator
and
you
have
not
argued,
but
why
is
that
not
a
square
holding
that
information
gathering
is
not
a
legislative
act
and
i
ask
you
that
because
i
hope
mr.
easterbrook
could
give
us
the
other
side
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
need
to
cite
anything
else?
we
have
a
got
a
long
argument
and
why
is
that
not
the
complete
answer
to
the
whole
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
said
so
clear,
it
is
strange
to
me
that
you
have
given
such
little
emphasis,
that
is
why
i
am
uncertain
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
again
mr.
stavis,
that
only
is
relevant
if
the
legality
or
the
illegality
of
the
conduct
is
material
and
in
an
immunity
case,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
got
to
assume
there
is
an
illegality.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
activity
that
must
determine
whether
the
clause
applies
and
your
argument
seems
to
me
it
should
be
that
information
gathering
is
not
a
legislative
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
that
deals
with
your
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
right
as
i
understand
it,
whenever
somebody
did
not
comply
with
the
subpoena,
the
congressional
committee
could
just
send
some
police
officers
with
a
guns
and
break
into
the
house
and
get
the
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
just
illegally,
not
just
by
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
willing
to
accept
illegally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
not
pressing
the
position
of
the
four
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
five?
