justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
the
district
of
montana.
it's
the
oldest
case
in
our
docket
having
being
argued
way
back
on
october
5th
and
has
been
delayed
here
for
one
reason
or
another.
one
of
the
reasons
being
the
fact
that
the
case
involves
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution.
this
is
a
clause
that
has
not
had
extended
treatment
in
this
court
heretofore
although
there
are
some
cases
about
it.
the
appellants
are
a
montana
outfitter
and
four
minnesota
residents
who
in
the
past
have
hunted
elk
in
the
rocky
mountains
in
montana.
the
state
of
montana
as
almost
every
other
state
issues
hunting
licenses
and
favors
residents
over
non-residents.
it's
system
imposes
license
fees
on
non-residents
that
are
approximately
seven-and-a-half
times
higher
than
those
on
residents.
and
in
addition
when
a
non-resident
wants
to
buy
a
hunting
license
for
elk,
he
has
to
purchase
a
combination
license,
that
is
one
to
hunt
other
animals,
the
bear
and
to
fish
as
well
an
order
to
obtain
a
single
elk.
a
montana
resident
does
not
have
to
do
that
and
so
the
appellants
challenged
this
system
and
claimed
that
it
violates
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv
and
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
by
a
divided
vote
denied
relief.
privileges
and
immunities
clause
reads
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states.
and
so,
so
far
as
that
issue
is
concerned
the
question
is
what
is
a
privilege
or
what
is
an
immunity
to
which
non-residents
are
entitled.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
hold
that
access
by
non-residents
to
recreational
big
game
hunting
does
not
fall
within
the
category
of
rights
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
it
is
only
with
respect
to
those
privileges
and
immunities
that
bear
upon
the
vitality
of
the
nation
as
an
entity
that
a
state
must
treat
all
citizens
resident
and
non-resident
equally.
and
here
equality
on
access
to
montana
elk
is
not
basic
to
maintenance
or
well
being
of
the
union
and
that
whatever
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
means
it
doesn't
apply
to
recreational
big
game
hunting
in
the
rocky
mountains
of
montana.
so
far
as
the
equal
protection
attack
is
concerned,
we
hold
that
the
states
statutory
scheme
is
an
economic
means
not
unreasonably
related
to
the
preservation
of
a
finite
resource,
namely
elk
and
to
a
substantial
regulatory
interest
on
the
part
of
a
state.
it
follows
that
the
system
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
and
hence
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
