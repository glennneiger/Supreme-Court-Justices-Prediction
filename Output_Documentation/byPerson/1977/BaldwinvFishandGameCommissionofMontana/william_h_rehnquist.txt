both
toomer
and
mullaney
involved
commercial
enterprises,
that
kind
of
calling
or
making
a
living
thing
that
i
think
bush
at
washington
first
referred
to
in
coryell
v.
corfield,
do
you
think
those
automatically
carry
over
to
big
game
money
which
certainly
is
not
a
way
of
making
a
living
at
least
for
the
people
who
come
in
and
hunt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
loomed
large
in
the
minds
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
the
right
of
the
people
in
one
state
to
hunt
elk
and
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
would
be
challenged
under
your
line
of
reasoning,
if
anybody
from
who
reside
in
montana
was
able
to
get
an
elk
license,
but
there
was
flat
sealing
on
the
number
of
out
of
staters
who
would
get
it,
but
no
license
fee
differential.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
another
factual
finding,
now
that
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
of
whether
a
statute
may
be
justified
under
a
particular
set
of
facts,
under
a
conceivable
set
of
facts,
is
itself
a
question
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
someone
had
come
to
montana
and
declared
his
residence
there,
would
he
then
say
ten
days
later,
i
have
been
able
to
get
a
resident
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
does
not
make
any
difference
how,
once
you
have
fulfilled
the
six
months
requirement,
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
how
much
longer
you
have
resided,
you
can
get
a
residence
license.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
not
an
injury
in
effect
to
them,
i
suppose
they
have
no
play?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goetz,
as
i
understand
the
record,
none
of
your
clients
assert
that
they
were
actual
residents
of
montana
who
were
denied
the
license
simply
because
they
had
not
fulfilled
the
six
months
requirement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
bear
season
in
montana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
there
any
reason
why
possessor
of
the
combination
license
could
not
come
back
in
the
spring
and
shoot
a
bear
if
he
found
they
were
all
hibernating
in
the
fall.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
argument
does
not
militate
against
the
combination
of
elk
and
deer
does
it,
it
just
--
