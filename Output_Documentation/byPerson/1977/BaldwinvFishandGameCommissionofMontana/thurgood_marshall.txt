mr.
goetz,
comment
on
how
many
states
have
laws
like
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
all
we
are
dealing
with
is
montana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
montana?
justice
thurgood
marshall
elk
hunters?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
elks
do
you
have
in
montana?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
got
14,000
shooting
at
them,
then
how
many
do
you
have
left?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
i
conclude
there
are
whole
lot
of
bad
shots.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
those
ranchers
can
keep
anybody
off
their
land.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
understand
why
for
that
reason
you
have
to
charge
somebody
an
extra
amount?
because
the
elk
comes
in
my
land
and
eats
my
forage,
therefore
i
keep
the
out
of
a
state
manner.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
my
real
question
is
that
isn't
it
true
that
montana
was
survived
with
this
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
the
license
with
montana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
only
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
seacoast
was
not
only
commercial,
it
was
very
high
powered
commercial.
