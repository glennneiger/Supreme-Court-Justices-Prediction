mr.
james
h.
goetz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
my
name
is
james
h.
goetz.
i
am
from
bozeman,
montana.
i
represent
the
appellants.
this
case
presents
a
challenge
on
constitutional
grounds
to
the
statutory
system
of
the
state
of
montana
by
which
big
game
licenses
are
made
available
to
hunters
who
are
not
residents
of
montana.
the
montana
statutory
scheme
is
challenged
on
the
basis
of
two
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution,
art.iv,
ยง
2,
the
interstate
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
amendment
fourteen,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
that
amendment.
the
statutory
system
is
challenged
in
two
parts,
the
first
is
challenge
goes
to
the
severe
license
fee
differential,
implicit
in
the
montana
statutory
scheme
that
is
the
differential
between
resident
and
non-resident
big
game
hunters.
the
second
challenge
goes
to
the
requirement
that
the
non-resident
in
order
to
hunt
in
montana
must
buy
what
is
called
a
combination
license
and
that
combination
license,
i
believe
is
described
adequately
in
the
appellant's
opening
brief.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
that
all
of
it
required
is
to
pay
some
money
to
get
th
combination
license.
i
think
it
presents
a
--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
that
is
true,
in
that
sense,
it
is
the
same
and
in
that
sense,
our
position,
appellant's
position
is
that
it
is
a
means
of
indirectly
gouging,
if
you
will
of
a
non-resident
hunter
to
increase
the
fees.
however,
in
the
constitutional
sense
it
is
different,
because
the
state
shows
to
defend
the
combination
license,
four
reasons
unrelated
to
the
monitory
or
a
cost
justification.
so
i
think
it
presents
a
different
issue
in
that
regard.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
i
think
i
would,
i
have
not
thought
about
it
in
that
context
right
away,
but
i
think
it
would
be
something
like
an
illegal
tie-in
and
in
the
sense
that
it
entails
an
indirect
imposition
which
must
be
undertaken
by
a
person
in
order
to
avail
themselves
of
the
right
to
hunt.
i
think
in
that
sense
it
is
much
like
an
anti-trust
tie-in,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
in
my
judgment
the
district
court
did
not,
there
is
one
footnote
in
the
district
court's
opinion
which
suggests
that
the
district
court
addressed
that
issue
simply
as
another
aspect
of
the
increase
in
fees,
somewhat
along
the
lines
of
justice
white's
question
here
today,
i
believe
it
is
clear
the
district
court
did
not
address
it
directly.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
yes
i
do
because
it
was
presented
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
rejected
the
plaintiffs
and
the
appellant's
challenge
to
the
combination
license
and
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
that
issue
was
presented
squarely
and
specifically
and
as
i
say,
it
was
referenced
in
the
footnote,
the
district
court
did
not
address
it
at
least
as
i
thought
they
should
have
as
a
separate
issue.
now,
the
position
of
the
appellants
on
the
constitutional
issue
is
that
the
combination
license
is
simply
unconstitutional
under
both
provisions
presented.
with
respect
to
the
fee
differential
as
a
severe
fee
differential,
it
is
position
of
appellants
that
that
as
supplied
in
montana
is
unconstitutional.
but
that
the
case
toomer
v.
witsell
and
the
companion
case
from
alaska,
mullaney
v.
anderson,
leave
room
on
the
fee
differential
for
some
additional
assessment
for
non-residents.
if
that
assessment
is
reasonably
related
to
one
of
two
factors
or
both,
those
factors
are
if
the
state
residents
can
contribute
taxes
which
go
to
the
resource
or
to
conservation,
which
the
nonresident
does
not
then
to
that
extent
the
non-resident
can
be
assessed
a
higher
fee.
the
second
aspect
of
the
toomer
and
mullaney
standard
is
that
if
the
non-resident
imposes
some
additional
enforcement
burden,
then
to
that
extent
the
non-resident
can
be
assessed
an
additional
fee
by
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
i
certainly
do
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
they
automatically
carry
over,
that
is
i
do
appreciate
a
difference
between
recreation
and
the
pursuit
of
a
common
calling.
however,
it
is
appellant's
position
here
that
when
logically
analyzed
and
with
due
regard
to
the
precedent
in
the
area
that
indeed
toomer
and
mullaney
do
apply
to
the
present
situation.
if
i
may
expand
on
that,
i
would
say
that
that
there
is
some
question
about
how
far
the
privileges
and
immunities
as
far
it
goes
to
what
it
applies,
and
i
have
looked
at
the
two
most
recent
or
two
of
the
most
recent
announcements
by
this
court.
the
most
recent
being
austin
v.
new
hampshire
and
there
the
case
did
not
not
my
in
my
guessing,
address
very
specifically
the
question
of
what
is
the
nature
of
the
right,
rather
the
opinion
of
the
court
went
to
the
purposes
of
the
privilege,
the
interstate
privileges
and
immunities
clause
namely
to
promote
comity
among
the
states
and
that
issue
was
certainly
and
that
purpose
is
certainly
brought
to
bear
in
present
case.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
it
was
probably
not
significant
question
at
that
time.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
do
not
think
there
were
any
elk
in
the
east,
but
at
any
rate,
the
premium
on
recreation
was
not
nearly
so
great
at
that
time
for
obvious
reasons,
plus
i
suspect,
but
i
do
not
know,
i
suspect
that
hunting
and
fishing
were
not
licensed
at
all.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
the
appendix
of
the
appellee
sets
forth
the
list
of
states.
in
the
first
place,
with
respect
to
the
combination
license
requirement,
i
think
no
state
other
than
montana
has
it.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yeah,
the
combination
license,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
that
has
that
kind
of
requirement.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
in
so
far
as
the
combination
license
is
involved.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
in
the
last
year
for
which
figures
are
available,
there
were
approximately
31,000
non-resident
hunters.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
elk
hunters
were
substantially
fewer
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
--
i
would
have
to
consult
defendant's
exhibit
a,
but
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
14,000
and
so
there
is
a
statutory
limit
for
non-resident
combination
licenses,
now
in
the
montana
statute
which
i
have
referenced
in
my
brief,
that
figure
of
17,000
that
figure,
has
not
been
approached.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
we
have
got
a
substantial
number
of
elk
in
montana
and
the
elk
is
quite
widely
and
all
elk
are
not
shot.
in
other
words,
not
all
hunters
get
elk,
those
are
14,000
non-residents,
of
course,
the
number
of
residents
is
much
greater
than
that.
so
we
have
substantial
number
of
elk
hunters.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
they
have
to
see
them
first
to
shoot
them.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
am
not
sure,
it
has
been
quite
a
substantial
period
of
time,
the
precise
fee
has
changed
of
course
with
time,
the
most
recent
being
in
1975.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
to
the
fee
structure
it
is.
there
was
a
requirement
in
montana
that
non-residents
be
accompanied
by
resident
outfitters
when
hunting
and
that
was
found
un-constitutional
by
the
montana
supreme
court
on
equal
protection
grounds
in
1975.
but
to
the
fee
structure,
to
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
first
montana
case.
now,
there
is
a
new
mexico
federal
case,
which
i
have
referenced
in
my
reply
brief
that
was
decided
in
august
of
this
year.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
i
believe
that
is
true.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no
i
do
not
frankly.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
it
is
rather
rare
that
an
elk
would
be
taken
by
bow
and
arrow
and
i
do
know
from
my
own
experience,
it
is
not
on
the
record,
but
the
turkey
is
not
a
very
prevalent
game
bird
in
montana
and
it
might
be
that
it
is
just
not
thought
to
be
a
very
important
issue.
if
i
may
--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
believe
that
is
the
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
is
not
clear
how
they
do
that
and
it
maybe
that
the
state
fishing
game
commission
has
to
implement
that
by
regulation.
my
understanding
it
is
on
a
first
come
first
serve
basis
of
whether
it
would
be
that
or
a
deadline
and
then
some
lot,
but
they
have
not
reached
that
figure
so
that
--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
and
that
has
not
been
challenged
of
course
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
believe
that
under
my
line
of
reasoning
that
would
be
equally
or
that
would
probably
be
faulty,
i
must
confess
that
since
that
is
not
in
the
case,
i
may
not
have
thought
through
it
as
carefully
as
i
have
the
issues
here,
but
it
is
my
position
that
that
probably
would
be
constitutionally
faulty
also.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
absolutely,
i
believe
that
would
be
flatly
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
think
that
is
an
excellent
answer
and
i
would
like
to
stand
on
that.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
i
think
the
case
presents
a
much
more
significant
issue
where
i
would
not
be
here.
but
in
order
to
respond
to
your
question,
i
believe
that
well,
if
we
look
at
the
senior
citizen
classification
under
the
equal
protection
clause
as
this
court
did
in
the
merger,
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
v.
merger,
it
was
decided
to
review
that
on
a
minimal
scrutiny
basis
and
if
the
state
has
reasonable
grounds
for
that
approach
then
that
would
pass
constitutional
muster.
the
difference
between
that
and
i
would
be
willing
in
the
minnesota
case
to
that
is
where
you
are
from,
is
not
it.
that
is
the
state
you
are
talking
about,
but
i
would
be
willing
to
accept
the
constitutionality
of
that
kind
of
discrimination,
if
we
carry
that
over
to
the
present
case,
i
think
we
have
an
explicit
holding
by
the
district
court
that
the
discrimination
is
not
justifiable
on
any
cost
basis
and
i
interpret
that
to
be
there
are
no
rational
grounds
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
unless
you
go
to
what
the
district
court
went
to
and
that
is
the
political
justification
and
i
think
lies
one
of
the
difference
between
your
situation
and
the
montana
situation
and
my
feeling
is
we
have
unanimous
finding
by
the
district
court
that
except
for
the
political
justification,
this
non-resident
fee
differential
cannot
be
justified
in
montana.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
i
think
that
is
a
factual
finding
in
this
sense,
facts
were
taken
by
the
district
court.
testimony
was
taken,
the
district
court
looked
at
that
testimony,
looked
at
the
rationalization
offered
by
the
state
and
then
said,
looking
at
the
evidences
can
not
be
justified.
even
giving
due
regard
to
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
i
agree
from
that
perspective,
there
has
to
be
legal
rubric
within
which
to
fit
the
facts
and
that
legal
rubric
in
the
district
court
was
this,
the
appellants
were
arguing
that
the
toomer
v.
witsell
standard
is
applicable.
that
is
to
the
extent
that
higher
enforcement
cost
or
conservation
resident
taxes
were
not
paid
or
posed
where
higher
enforcement
costs
were
posed
by
nonresident,
their
conservation
resident
taxes
were
unpaid,
there
could
be
a
higher
non-resident
fee
and
that
is
a
legal
rubric
within
which
the
court
found
in
my
judgment
that
factually
the
state
cost
justification
does
not
fit
into
that.
i
guess,
i
would
classify
that
as
a
mixed
law
facts.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
75%
of
the
elk
taken
in
montana
are
taken
on
federal
land.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
in
my
judgment
under
the
property
clause,
constitutionally
congress
could
on
the
federal
lands
have
a
federal
license
and
i
might
add
to
that
one
of
the
worries
posed
on
i
think
both
sides
implicitly
in
this
case,
from
a
state's
right
standpoint
is
a
federal
license.
my
feeling
is
--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
right,
either
one,
federal
what
montana
might
call
federal
intervention,
my
feeling
is
that
if
the
appellant's
position
were
accepted
here
and
if
reasonable
constitutional
limitations
were
placed
on
the
states,
it
would
pose
less
threat
in
terms
of
outside
what
is
perceived
to
be
outside
or
federal
influence
with
the
game
in
montana.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
am
not
sure
what
they
would
have
to
do,
in
terms
of
hunting
on
the
federal
lands,
i
guess,
my
feeling
is
that
congress
could
preempt
the
area,
if
it
wanted
to,
in
so
far
as
gaming
of
course,
on
non-federal
lands,
i
am
not
sure
if
congress
has
any
interest
in
doing
that.
so
i
think,
i
would
separate
the
two
in
that
sense.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
it
is
relevant
and
important
under
both.
however,
there
may
be
different
standards
of
judicial
review
under
the
equal
protection
clause
as
opposed
to
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
according
to
our
theory
that
standard
would
be
the
same
and
we
take
that
standard
of
course,
from
toomer
v.
witsell
and
there
is
no,
well,
i
was
going
to
say
to
my
knowledge
there
is
no
equal
protection
case
that
imposes
that
same
standard.
however,
it
should
be
recognized
in
takahashi
v.
fish
&
game
commission
of
california
was
decided
at
the
same
time
of
toomer
and
is
an
equal
protection
clause
and
i
think
juxtaposing
those
two
cases,
given
their
similarities
in
the
time
proximity
that
really,
probably
that
toomer
v.
witsell
standard
applies
also
under
the
equal
protection
standard.
i
have
reserved
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal,
so
i
will
conclude
at
this
point.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
durational
residency
requirement.
i
might
say
in
that
connection
that
one
of
the
nonresident
plaintiffs,
however
is
a
property
owner
in
montana
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
mr.
lenzini's
argument
on
depredation
is
that
he
is
equating
non-residency
with
property
ownership.
there
may
be
nonresidents
who
own
property,
who
contribute
likewise
to
the
elk
resource.
obviously
the
incident
to
that
is
lower
than
resident
property
owners.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
that
is
correct
also.
in
response
to
the
appellee's
position,
first
i
would
like
to
say
with
regard
to
the
ownership
question
that
i
think
that
this
court
has
settled
that
issue
in
the
recent
decision
in
douglas
v.
seacoast
products
where
the
opinion
indicated
that
rather
than
viewing
wildlife
and
some
kind
of
ownership
context,
the
proper
way
to
look
at
the
wildlife
resources
to
the
traditional
police
power's
concept
and
that
is
the
position
that
appellants
have
taken
throughout
this
decision.
i
believe
the
language
in
douglas
seacoast
is
very
strong
in
that
regard.
now,
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
issue,
mr.
lenzini
has
argued
that
the
both
the
license
fee
differential
and
i
understand
also
the
combination
license
requirement,
both
of
those
are
very
important
management
tools
and
the
thrust
of
the
district
court
decision
is
that
this
is
a
valid
conservation
measure.
i
think
the
record
throws
substantial
doubt
on
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
state
of
montana
did
not
attempt
to
justify
this
in
the
district
court
as
a
conservation
measure.
secondly,
montana
in
1975
charged
residents
only
$4
to
hunt
an
elk.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
i
do
not
think
it
has
to
assert
that,
we
have
very
little
legislative
history
in
montana.
however,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
state
fishing
game
department
in
defending
the
case
in
the
district
court
did
not
assert
that,
that
does
not
necessarily
bar
them
from
arguing
it
now,
but
i
think
it
does
show
some
doubt
on
whether
they
firmly
believe
that
this
can
be
justified
as
a
reasonable
management
tool.
you
see
there
is
no
limit
on
the
number
of
nonresident
licenses
that
can
be
issued
for
elk
and
they
cost
only
$9
now.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no,
i
mean
on
residents
--
mr.
james
h.
goetz
pardon
me.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
you
do
not
have
to
be
in
an
adult
male
to
hunt.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
in
any
event
the
district
court
seemed
to
find
that
there
are
large
numbers
of
hunters
and
a
finite
number
of
elk
and
i
think
there
obviously
is
a
finite
dimension
on
that
resource,
but
the
legislature
has
not
imposed
any
restrictions
on
residents
as
far
as
hunting
them.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
600,000
approximately.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
and
approximately
a
198,000
hunting
licenses
are
issued
in
montana.
however
that
relates
to
the
whole
spectrum
of
game
birds
etcetera.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
they
are
one
per
license,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
this
is
viewed
as
a
conservation
device
and
this
economic
discrimination
designed
to
discourage
nonresident
hunters,
we
can
see
likewise
that
there
is
no
equivalent
in
terms
of
the
resident
hunters
and
douglas
v.
seacoast
products
said
that
this
can
not
properly
be
viewed
in
the
virginia
context
as
a
legitimate
conservation
measure.
if
you
have
no
limits
or
no
policies
to
discouraging
the
residents
and
simply
discriminate
against
the
nonresidents.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
that
is
true,
but
i
think
the
proposition
for
which
i
cited
that
is
the
difference
between
the
resident
and
the
non-resident
and
the
fact
that
virginia
did
not
take
any
measure
to
discourage
residents.
i
think
that
is
applicable
to
the
present
case.
in
any
event,
if
we
look
at
the
combination
license
requirement
we
have
something
that
appears
wholly
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now,
for
instance
in
1975,
montana
changed
its
combination
license
from
one
elk
two
deer,
to
one
elk,
one
deer
and
one
black
bear.
the
record
shows
that
with
respect
on
the
abridger
to
the
later
half
of
the
hunting
season,
black
bears
were
hibernated.
now,
what
kind
of
conservation
device
or
management
tool
is
that,
they
are
not
huntable.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yeah,
they
are
just
not
going
to
be
around
the
shoe,
and
in
line
with
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
mistake
an
elk
for
black
bear,
if
the
black
bear
is
hibernated
obviously
and
even
if
it
is
not
hibernated,
it
is
rather
difficult
to
mistake
those
two.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
there
is,
there
are
two
bear
season,
one
in
the
spring
and
then
there
is
a
bear
season
that
is
pretty
much
the
equivalent
of
the
elk
season
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
spring
bear
season
is
different
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
combination
license
does
not
impact
that
one
way
another.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
has
to
buy
an
additional
license
for
to
start
with.
i
just
do
not
know
that,
but
secondly
there
is
an
economic
reason
of
course
that
cost
money
to
come
into
the
state,
a
second
time
and
the
record
divulges
that
black
bears
are
not
in
great
demand
in
terms
of
hunting
that
is
in
1975,
the
year
before
this
went
into
effect
730
nonresident
black
bear
license
were
issued
as
opposed
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
mr.
lenzini
correct
me
about
20,000
elk
deer
combination
licenses.
so
obviously
most
nonresidents
who
want
to
hunt
either
elk
or
deer,
do
not
desire
to
hunt
black
bear.
so
what
it
appears
as
though
the
state
of
montana
is
doing
is
gauzing
the
nonresident
with
higher
fees
to
subsidise
artificially
the
operation
of
a
fishing
game
department
in
montana
while
charging
probably
the
nonresidents
an
unreasonably
low
figure.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
no
that
goes
to
the
license
fee
differential
however
the
problem
with
the
license,
the
economic
problem
as
justice
white
is
compounded
by
loading
on
other
licenses
and
then
saying,
well
you
have
got
to
pay
before
because
you
have
got
to
buy
these
other
licenses.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
well,
in
one
sense
it
is
and
in
the
sense
that
if
you
look
at
the
combination
license
as
simply
a
way
to
assess
more
fees
to
the
nonresident.
however,
in
constitutional
sense
what
that
combination
license
is,
is
excess
baggage
that
is
conceivably
although
i
do
not
believe
it
should
be
the
case,
this
court
could
hold
up
a
reasonable
or
an
unreasonable
differentiation
and
still
find
the
combination
license
so
arbitrary
and
capricious
which
it
seems
to
me
it
is,
of
that
it
would
strike
that
down,
and
that
would
be
the
argument
i
would
be
making
here,
if
i
thought
this
differential
was
reasonable
under
the
toomer
standard,
not
withstanding
the
combination
license.
that
is
we
would
just
attack
the
combination
license.
however,
we
think
that
the
differentiation
cannot
make
the
toomer
and
mullaney
standards
in
any
event,
so
to
that
extent,
i
think
they
are
two
separate
issues
and
as
mr.
lenzini
pointed
out,
he
tried
to
justify
them
of
the
combination
license
on
a
separate
basis.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
the
record
does,
i
can
not
tell
you
off
hand
where
it
is,
if
i
think
for
just
a
second.
mr.
james
h.
goetz
that
is
the
number
of
hunters
who
hunt
elk,
but
the
question
is
what
percentage
of
residents
take
elk
as
opposed
to
nonresidents
is
that
your
question?
mr.
james
h.
goetz
yes,
the
short
answer
is
found
in
the
footnote
17,
on
page
32
of
mr.
lenzini's
brief,
the
success
ratio
in
74
nonresidents
succeeded
on
15%
of
their
elk
licenses
compared
with
11%
success
ratio
for
residents.
