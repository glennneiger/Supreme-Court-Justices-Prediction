mr.
goetz,
your
cost,
the
cost
problem,
the
cost
justification
issue
is
that
relevant
to
both
your
equal
protection
claim
and
your
privileges
and
immunities
claim
or
does
it
have
different
constitutional
significance
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
standard
of
what
the
state
and
according
to
your
theory
must
prove
in
order
to
cost
justify
that
license
be
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
say
i
just
do
not
follow
the
reasoning
because
the
classification
in
either
case,
we
are
taking
of
equal
protection,
now
let
us
forget
about
privilege
and
immunities,
the
classification
between
residents
and
non-residents,
you
say
that
is
a
legitimate
classification,
if
it
is
a
legitimate
classification
why
cannot
they
say
no
non-residents
at
all.
here
you
have
said,
no
nonresidents
who
cannot
afford
$240
or
whatever
it
is,
but
let
us
say
it
is
an
equal
protection
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
these
cases
as
justice
white
points
out,
we
do
not
want
too
many
people
overusing
our
park
facilities
and
we
would
rather
save
them
for
the
taxpayers
of
pay
forums,
so
we
will
simply
exclude
our
(inaudible),
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
a
racial
classification,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
if
the
record
tells
us
how
many
elk
are
taken
by
residents
as
opposed
to
nonresident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
