do
i
understand
you
to
agree
with
those
propositions.
unknown
speaker
well
how
many
licenses
are
applied
for
montana,
i
mean,
only
people
are
involved
in
it.
unknown
speaker
in
montana?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goetz
how
long
have
these
disparate
fees
were
in
effect
in
your
state?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
the
first
challenge
that
you
know
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
now,
there
are
aspects
of
your
statutory
structure
where
no
distinction
is
drawn
between
resident
and
non-resident,
is
that
not
so?
bow
and
arrow
shooting?
unknown
speaker
and
wild
turkeys?
unknown
speaker
do
know
why
there
is
a
different
treatment
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goetz,
in
my
home
state
there
is
a
provision
that
senior
citizens
like
most
of
us
up
here
over
the
age
of
'x'
years
can
get
a
fishing
license
without
charge
at
all,
but
they
had
to
get
a
license,
under
your
line
of
reasoning
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
the
minimum
significance,
they
would
catch
a
fish.
they
are
the
ones
that
always
are
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
your
case
amounts
to
--
you
better
dig
out
more
than
that
--
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall
in
dry
years,
south
dakota
has
limited
present
resident
hunting
to
residents
on
occasion.
unknown
speaker
and
there
maybe
a
lot
of
residents,
who
do
not
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
elk
that
maybe
taken.
unknown
speaker
one
per
license.
