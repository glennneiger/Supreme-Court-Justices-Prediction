justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
latter
really
any
different
from
the
first?
all
that
required
is
to
pay
some
money
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
just
a
--
you
can
get
it
if
you
just
pay
some
money,
quite
a
bit
of
more
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
or
is
it
in
the
record,
what
percentage
of
the
elks
that
are
taken
on
federal
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
if
all
of
the
united
states
believes
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
state
under
our
cases,
if
congress
were
so
inclined,
i
suppose,
it
could
limit
or
regulate
the
taking
of
elk
on
federal
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
may
be
not
a
federal
license
but
a
limit
on
what
the
states
could
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
your
position
then
that
the
state
of
montana,
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
just
exclude
non-residents
entirely
from
recreational
hunting?
i
mean,
in
so
far
as
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
considered.
justice
byron
r.
white
similarly
with
the
parks.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
how
about
state
parks,
just
reserving
state
parks
for
the
use
of
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
just
say
the
state
says
that
for
political
purposes
namely
to
encourage
our
citizens
to
be
willing
to
put
up
the
money
for
state
parks,
we
are
going
to
exclude
nonresidents,
it
is
just
recreation,
they
just
only
want
to
do
is
to
camp
and
walk
around.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
that
would
be
reached
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
equal
protection,
you
would
say
you
would
need
more
than
a
rational
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
interest
remains
the
same,
the
interest
in
nonresidents
and
you
are
saying
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
you
would
say
that
interest
in
entitled
to
more
weight?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
your
mind
of
the
interest
so
called
involved.
