mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants
challenge
to
separate
features
at
montana's
statutory
beginning
licensing,
first
the
combination
license
and
second
the
higher
fees
imposed
upon
non-residents.
montana,
however
is
by
no
means
unique
among
the
states
in
charging
higher
fees
for
hunting
by
nonresidents,
indeed
virtually
every
state
does
charge
higher
fees.
resolution,
the
constitutional
issue
here
requires
analysis
of
the
asserted
right
as
well
as
a
regulatory
interest
of
the
state
of
montana
in
regularly
in
big
game
species.
appellants
claim
that
this
case
is
covered
by
toomer
v.
witsell
and
that
the
p&i
clause
of
the
constitution
requires
that
non-residents
should
be
treated
on
terms
of
substantial
equality
with
residents.
either
the
appellants
or
the
dissenting
judge
below,
however
assert
that
recreational
hunting
is
a
fundamental
privilege
and
immunity
and
indeed
no
case
has
ever
held
rather
appellants
argue
that
extraneous
features
involved
here
call
them
to
play
the
protections
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
namely,
the
fact
that
75%
of
the
elk
are
taken
on
federally
on
land
and
the
fact
that
the
state
receives
financial
assistance
from
the
federal
government
for
wildlife
restoration
programs.
appellees
submit
that
this
analysis
without
any
support
in
the
judicial
history
of
the
p&i
clause
and
indeed
from
the
earliest
interpretation
in
corfield
v.
corfield,
the
courts
have
consistently
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
right
itself.
the
clause
has
never
been
considered
to
guarantee
the
nonresident,
equality
and
all
rights
and
privileges
and
the
fundamental
right
analysis
has
been
consistently
followed.
neither
may
the
appellants
transform
somehow
this
recreation
activity
in
to
an
activity
covered
by
the
privileges
clause,
simply
because
of
federal
landing
involved.
congress
has
declared
that
on
the
national
forest
and
indeed
much
the
land
in
western
montana
where
the
elk
is
taken
is
national
forest
and
has
declared
that
in
60
u.s.c.
section
4e,
the
jurisdiction
over
the
national
forest
resides
in
the
state,
both
civil
and
criminal.
indeed
in
the
multiple-use
sustained-yield
act
of
1960,
affecting
the
national
forest,
in
usc528,
congress
specifically
declared
that
nothing
there
in
shall
be
considered
affecting
the
jurisdiction,
a
responsibility.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
in
so
far
as
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
concerned,
i
believe
it
could
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
have
a
different
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
with
the
national
parks?
by
law
there
is
no
hunting
permitted
at
all.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
submit
that
under
the
privileges
clause,
the
court
could
because
a
fundamental
right
is
not
involved.
i
think
we
have
a
different
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
i
believe
that
unlike
this
case,
where
we
have
a
substantial
number
of
nonresidents
coming
into
montana,
there
i
think
the
question
would
probably
require
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
by
this
court.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
if
the
state
seem
absolutely
deterred,
all
incoming
non-residents,
i
think
we
have
a
different
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
reached
by
the
p$i
clause.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
because
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
not
the
case
of
course,
but
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
look
at
different
reasons
for
the
state
that
is
what
is
rational
in
that
situation
might
be
different
than
-
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
where
there
is
--
if
federal
lands
are
involved
for
example,
i
think
that
there
might
well
be
a
different
measure
of
the
states
conservation
activity
than
in
the
situation
here.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
well,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
implicit
or
explicit
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
correct
and
where
the
classification
is
not
invidious
as
here
but
where
the
result
is
a
total
exclusion,
i
could
see
the
court
applying
a
different
level
not
necessarily
strict
scrutiny
but
--.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
because
of
the
result
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
that
conceivably
a
state
could
say
no
nonresidents
at
all,
it
would
depend
upon
the
rationale
of
the
state
what
it
was
trying
to
do,
and
i
think
we
had
for
example
a
situation
we
had
a
rare
species
and
only
a
limited
number
could
be
hunted,
i
believe
that
the
state
can
readily
say
and
demonstrate
the
need.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
simply
believe
that
it
is
not
a
fundamental
right
and
i
believe
that
the
classification
is
not
invidious.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
well,
toomer
versus
witsell
was
a
p&i
clause
case
and
in
toomer
versus
witsell
we
are
talking
only
equal
protection.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
correct,
that
case
came
to
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
--
and
appeal
was
dismissed
because
of
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
federal
aid,
the
federal
aid
in
wildlife
restoration
act
provides
an
11%
excise
tax
on
certain
scoring
arms
and
ammunition
and
of
course
sends
money
back
to
the
states
for
wildlife
restoration
programs.
montana
is
a
beneficiary
of
that,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
the
pittman
-robertson
act,
which
in
any
way
restricts
the
state
in
connection
with
nonresident,
resident
differentials
and
thus
happily
submit
that
the
p&i
clause
cannot
be
transformed
to
cover
this
activity
simply
because
of
the
presence
of
federal
land
or
because
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
provided
for
federal
assistance.
congress
knows
how
to
establish
limitations,
and
it
has
done
so
in
connection
with
military
personnel
on
military
reservation.
those
lands
are
generally
planned
over
which
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction,
but
even
there,
congress
has
said,
state
fishing
licenses
shall
be
required,
but
that
if
personnel
who
are
on
duty
for
more
30
days,
they
need
not
to
have
a
state
license,
if
the
state
does
not
provide
licenses
on
terms
as
favorable
as
those
for
residents.
so
congress
knows
how
to
establish
conditions.
it
simply
has
not
done
so.
the
question
here
also
involves
nature
of
the
state
right
of
the
wildlife.
in
toomer
v.
witsell,
the
court
stated
that
it
was
long
ago
decided
that
one
of
the
privileges
which
the
clause
of
privileges
and
immunities
clause
guarantees
is
that
of
doing
business
in
state
b
on
terms
of
substantial
equality
with
citizens
of
that
state.
but
plainly,
toomer
dealt
with
commercial
shrimping
doing
business
and
does
not
govern
the
institute
case.
both,
the
majority
below
and
the
dissenting
judge
found
that
the
case
involved
recreational
hunting
and
the
majority
state
that
elk
is
not
now
and
never
will
hunted
commercially.
turning
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
court
below
found
that
the
montana
scheme,
there
is
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
it
held
that
it
was
a
finite
local
resource,
not
everybody
could
hunt
it
and
therefore
some
restriction
had
to
be
made
on
hunter
days.
the
district
court
did
not
choose
between
the
ownership
doctrine
and
the
police
power
doctrine.
the
nature
of
the
state's
power
to
conserve
wildlife
has
involved
some
semantic
difficulties.
we
have
had
the
ownership
doctrine
versus
the
police
power
doctrine.
in
a
1935
decision
of
this
court
bayside
fish
flour
company
v.
gentry
297
us,
mr.
justice
sutherland
declared
that
over
a
while
being
generally
the
state
has
supreme
control.
but
in
toomer
v.
witsell,
the
court
said
that
well,
that
ownership
was
simply
a
legal
fiction.
but
it
was
a
legal
friction,
which
was
expressed,
even
legal
shorthand
of
the
importance
to
its
people,
that
a
state
had
power
to
preserve
and
regulate
the
exploitation
of
an
important
resource.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
owned
by
the
state
as
opposed
to
prior
that
ownership,
in
the
mineral
situation,
the
state
has
technical
ownership,
as
it
would
with
the
state
capital
i
believe,
the
state
capital
building.
but
in
connection
with
fish
and
wildlife
i
think
the
state
has
a
qualified
ownership.
it
does
not
have
technical
ownership
as
mr.
justice
---
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
it
is
simply
a
question
of
title
your
honor,
i
think
that
where
the
state
owned
minerals
it
has
a
patent,
perhaps,
from
the
federal
government,
first
from
someone
else,
it
has
all
of
the
indicia
of
what
consider
to
be
necessary
to
clear
title.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no
sir,
i
am
not
titled
to
things
that
are
capable
of
ownership,
ordinarily
rest
somewhere
but
title
to
wildlife
is
in
no
one,
it
was
held
that
common
law
to
be
raised
newly
as,
it
was
owned
by
no
one.
but
although
it
is
owned
by
no
one,
there
was
a
right,
a
beneficial
right
to
utilize
the
wildlife
and
it
was
held
to
be
in
the
state
for
the
benefit
of
its
people,
that
is
the
holding
of
geer
v.
connecticut.
but
mr.
justice
marshall
earlier
this
year
stated
in
douglas
v.
seacoast,
said
it
is
fantasy
to
talk
about
the
state
owning
wildlife,
because
wildlife
cannot
be
owned
in
the
sense
so
they
--private
game
preserve
owner
owns
the
animals
that
he
has
stocked
there
in.
last
year
in
kleppe
v.
new
mexico,
taking
again
about
the
nature
of
the
state's
interest
there
justice
marshall
stated,
that
state
has
board,
trustee
and
police
power
interest
in
wildlife.
so
we
had
difficulty
in
semantics,
and
one
is
the
state
ownership.
in
toomer,
chief
justice
benson
stated
that
there
is
considerable
authority
beginning
with
year
to
support
the
contention
of
the
state,
that
a
state
can
fine
the
consumption
of
fishing
game
wholly
within
its
limits.
as
a
representative
of
its
people,
it
can
keep
the
fishing
wildlife
from
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
if
it
is
reduced
to
possession
lawfully,
it
is
capable
of
ownership
an
it
is
owned
by
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
it
is
no
longer
wildlife
but
personal
property
but
prior
to
it
being
lawfully
reduced
possession,
it
is
considered
not
to
be
held
on
technical
ownership.
so
it
is
clear
from
the
cases
that
this
thing
does
not
have
a
technical
ownership
in
wildlife.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
ownership
is
no
one
one,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
state's
authority
of
wildlife
is
that
for
the
common
good
and
conveys
all
the
authority,
the
technical
ownership
ordinarily
confers
such
as
in
toomer
where
the
court
said,
it
is
important
that
the
state
had
the
power
to
preserve
and
exploit
the
exploitation
of
an
important
resource.
if
the
authority
of
the
state
must
be
expressed
in
terms
of
police
power
however,
appellees
then
submit
that
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
in
managing
wildlife
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
recognition
of
beneficial
user
and
by
the
people.
a
use
of
(inaudible)
right
perhaps.
we
then
turn
to
appellants'
equal
protection
claim,
it
is
alleged
that
residence
is
a
suspect
classification
and
thus
requires
a
showing
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
to
sustain
its
use.
appellees
submit
that
the
classification
of
residents
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
suspect,
it
is
not
aimed
at
any
discrete
minority
such
as
classification
by
race,
religion,
sex
or
alienage,
and
involves
no
fundamental
right.
a
nonresident's
opportunity
to
hunt
a
priced
trophy
species,
simply
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
the
fundamental
right
and
the
record
discloses
that
the
non-resident
hunter
is
not
a
group,
who
was
in
need
of
special
solicitude
under
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
montana
has
a
six
month
residency
requirement
and
if
he
had
resided
for
six
months
prior
to
the
application
for
the
license,
he
would
have
gotten
a
residence
permit.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
that
is
correct.
a
trial
below
the
appellants
have
tempted
to
show
that
the
license
fee
differentials
could
not
be
cost
justified
by
additional
expenditures
imposed
on
residence
and
appellant's
witness
testify
that
at
most
and
their
calculations,
the
state
can
charge
a
nonresident
fee
of
2.5
to
1,
this
approach
is
comparable
however
to
the
approach
taken
in
the
commercial
fishing
cases,
namely
those
fundamental
rights
cases
where
the
requirement
of
substantial
equality
between
residents
and
nonresidents
was
involved
and
it
is
seemed
that
recreational
hunting
is
a
fundamental
right.
the
district
court
below
determined
that
no
records
were
kept,
which
precisely
disclose
the
direct
and
indirect
cost
which
properly
maybe
a
portion
and
thus
the
court
found
that
the
ration
7.5-1
could
not
be
justified
on
any
basis
of
cost
allocation.
however,
the
court
did
not
specifically
address
the
arguments
that
lay
behind
pros
and
cons
of
the
arguments
behind
the
combination
license
issue
in
its
view
of
the
case.
the
appellant
below
demonstrated,
attempted
to
demonstrate
that
the
direct
costs
were
those
costs
of
the
fishing
game
department
itself,
and
that
indirect
cost
for
all
of
the
costs
spent
by
the
state
in
that
year
which
amounted
to
about
$211
million
and
when
the
appellant's
witness
below
calculated
the
number
of
person
days
in
that
montanan
spent
in
montana
versus
the
number
of
person
days
spent
by
nonresident
hunters,
the
witness
determined
that
one-tenth
of
1%
of
all
these
indirect
costs
could
be
utilized
by
the
state
as
a
cost
of
the
hunting
license
and
the
witness
testified
that
no
other
cost,
i
mean,
no
other
forbearance,
no
other
state
interest
could
properly
be
considered
in
establishing
the
price
of
the
hunting
service
as
it
was
stated.
another
appellant's
witnesses
testified
that
the
license
fee
should
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
and
that
no
one
should
become
bogged
down
in
any
measurement
of
value.
appellees
submit
that
the
foregoing
analysis
is
of
course
unrealistic,
because
many
elements
are
involved
in
producing
big
game
populations
that
may
be
harvested
in
a
state.
private
ranch
lands
are
involved,
because
during
the
critical
winter
month
of
the
year,
elk
and
deer
move
down
from
a
higher
elevations
which
can
be
federally
owned
land
and
move
down
into
the
lower
private
lands
where
they
spend
the
winter
months,
which
are
the
critical
months
in
survival
and
depend
upon
forage
provided
by
those
ranch
lands.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
it
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
am
saying
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
deer
and
the
elk
service
just
to
a
large
extent
because
of
the
presence
of
those
ranch
lands
and
the
mere
fact
that
they
could
keep
hunters
off
the
land
does
not
mean
that
they
keep
the
deer
off
the
land
or
the
elk
off
the
land
in
fact,
they
had
no
recourse
for
the
damage
and
depredations
they
may
receive
from
the
deer
and
elk.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
yes.
but
the
deer
and
elk
are
not
taken
on
your
land,
they
come
on
your
land
during
the
winter
months
and
during
the
summer
months,
and
in
the
fall
months,
they
migrate
off
your
land
and
they
move
on
to
adjoining
federal
land
and
that
is
where
they
are
being
taken
off
on
land,
not
your
land
and
there
being
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
are
we
talking
about
the
combination
license?
are
we
talking
about
the
license
fee
differential?
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think,
montana
as
a
state
will
survive
within
the
question
hours
whether
the
wildlife
management
program
was
survived.
that
is
the
question.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
this
is
the
only
state
that
i
am
aware
of
that
has
a
combination
license,
it
is
one.
well,
there
are
two
questions
i
think
justice
marshall,
there
is
a
combination
license
and
there
is
the
question
of
the
rest
of
the
fee
differentials
and
the
fee
differentials
is
an
extremely
important
management
tool
used
by
the
state
wildlife
agencies
and
if
that
were
held
unconstitutional
there
would
be
a
very
significant
impact
on
fish
and
wildlife
management,
particularly
wildlife
management.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
in
some
states,
in
fact
like
colorado
there
are
provisions
under
state
statute
or
claims
by
ranchers
for
depredations.
in
the
state
of
montana,
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom
has
decided
not
to
provide
a
claims
procedure
for
ranchers
and
therefore
they
are
required
simply
to
undergo
this
depredation
and
loss
of
forage.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
certainly
submit
that
they
are,
yes
indeed.
it
is
an
opportunity
cost,
because
if
they
chose
to
keep
those
elk
and
deer
off
of
their
ranch
lands
they
might
do
better
in
some
other
pursuit,
they
might
be
able
to
have
more
forage,
more
grazing,
but
the
montana
supreme
court
has
said
that
one
who
acquires
property
in
montana
does
so
with
notice
and
knowledge
that
we
had
some
very
substantial
big
game
populations
here
and
he
does
so
with
knowledge
that
wild
game
cannot
distinguish
between
fructis
nature
allies
and
fructis
industry
allies,
and
therefore
cannot
control
animals.
they
cannot
be
controlled
through
the
owner
and
accordingly
a
property
owner
in
the
state
of
montana
must
recognize
the
fact
that
there
may
be
some
injury
to
property,
from
wild
game
for
which
there
is
no
recourse.
and
in
state
versus
rathbone
100
pacific
seconds
state
really
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
believe
that
operates
as
a
control.
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that
in
years
when
legislature
has
raised
that
the
there
has
been
a
drop
off
in
a
number
of
nonresidents.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
i
think
you
are
correct,
i
think
that
the
fee
here
is
$225,
i
think
that
the
record
indicates
that
over
a
$1,000
is
involved
apart
from
that
and
spending
seven
days
for
hunting.
so
it
is
a
very
expensive
recreation
and
the
$225
is
not
that
much
but
the
plaintiff's
--
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
no,
i
think
not
because
i
think
to
some
extent
it
is
a
disincentive,
it
is
a
control
mechanism
that
is
why
the
plaintiffs
are
here.
their
witnesses
say
that
they
can
not
come
back
next
year
because
of
this
license
fee
increase.
so
for
their
concern,
it
is
a
disincentive
and
that
is
why
they
are
here.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
well,
i
think
that
we
can
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
an
increased
license
fee
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
some
people.
now,
it
may
not
have
an
effect
on
a
person
who
is
(inaudible)
comes
out.
but
it
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
some
people,
may
be
from
south
dakota,
may
be
neighbors
from
colorado,
but
it
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
some
people.
this
case
is
not
in
toomer
v.
witsell
situation
where
in
the
year
prior
to
the
$2,500
license
fee,
there
were
100
nonresident
shrimp
boats
license
and
following
enactment
of
that
license
fee
there
were
no
shrimp
boats
licensed
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
south
carolina.
the
effect
to
that
case
was
to
exclude
nonresidents,
we
have
here
instead
a
situation
where
in
the
period
of
1960
to
1970,
the
number
of
montana
residents
hunting
in
the
state
had
increased
by
about
67%
and
the
number
of
nonresidents
had
increased
over
530%.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
montana
in
1974
was
the
state
most
frequently
visited
by
out-of-state
hunters.
we
have
a
siltation
here
where
during
1974.
there
were
32,000
nonresident
big
game
hunters
and
there
were
20,500
nonresident
combination
licenses
issued,
not
14,000
as
stated
by
appellant.
mr.
paul
a.
lenzini
limit
of
17,000
came
into
the
law
later,
your
honor.
based
with
this
increase
in
the
number
of
nonresidents,
the
legislature
simply
increased
fee
for
the
nonresident
license.
the
state
shows
an
economic
means
to
limit
the
number
of
hunter
days
and
the
method
plainly
is
not
arbitrary.
with
respect
to
the
combination
license.
the
record
below
indicates
that
nonresidents
hunt
in
larger
groups
than
the
residents,
they
usually
come
in
groups
of
four
or
more
and
that
license
swapping
is
a
problem
and
it
is
likely
to
recur
more
among
nonresidents
whereas
residents
tend
to
hunt
in
smaller
groups,
one
or
two
and
in
tempting
to
force
its
conservation
laws,
the
state
of
montana
has
adapted
the
equal
responsibility
law,
they
have
a
state
of
about
145,000
square
miles
and
they
have
70
game
wardens
at
this
time,
which
means
that
each
game
warden
is
supposed
to
cover
an
area
of
about
2,000
square
miles,
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
that.
but
the
state
does
have
over
400
licensed
out
fitters
and
guide
and
so
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom
said
that
if
a
violation
occurs
in
hunting
party,
which
is
guided
by
a
lot
of
license
outfitter
and
guide
then
unless
that
guide
or
outfitters
reports
a
violation,
he
himself
is
equally
responsible
with
the
person
committing
the
violation,
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
license
swapping,
because
of
the
practice,
people
going
out
and
one
buys
a
license
for
deer,
one
buys
a
license
for
elk
and
then
if
they
come
upon
the
one
and
he
is
not
licensed
for
it,
they
still
make
feel
that
they
can
take
the
deer
or
the
elk.
because
of
that
problem
the
legislature
decided
to
establish
the
combination
license
so
that
whatever
you
tended
to
come
across,
in
so
far
as
bear,
deer
and
elk
are
concerned,
you
would
be
licensed
for
that
and
the
record
below
indicates
that
nonresidents
utilize
outfitters
more
than
residents,
perhaps
the
size
of
50%
in
some
areas
of
western
montana.
the
dissenting
opinion
below
said
that
the
use
of
a
political
justification
namely
that
without
this
discrimination,
the
program
will
not
receive
political
support.
the
dissent
said
that
that
was
inherently
inappropriate.
the
appellee
submit
that
such
political
considerations
are
part
and
parcel
of
numerous
legislative
choices,
and
cannot
be
set
to
vitiate
the
choice
unless
fundamental
rights
are
involved
or
unless
invidious
classifications
are
made.
we
submit
that
in
san
antonio
school
district
versus
rodriguez,
decided
by
this
court
in
1973,
such
considerations
were
taken
into
account
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
texas
system,
a

in
that
case
the
financing
method
was
the
ad

tax
on
property
within
the
state

supplemented
by
funds
from
the
state
central
system.
the
attack
on
that,
the
equal

in
fact,
they
said,
on
the
basis
of
wealth
because
some
districts
had
less
valuable
properties
than
others
that
the
school
districts
were
being
deprived
of
their
equal
protection
right,
but
the
court
referring
to
local
control,
the
school
districts
which
was
fostered
by
the
texas
plan
concluded
that
the
plan
was
not
irrational
because
people
of

which

to

the
court
said
that
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
the
state
of
california
could
conceivably
