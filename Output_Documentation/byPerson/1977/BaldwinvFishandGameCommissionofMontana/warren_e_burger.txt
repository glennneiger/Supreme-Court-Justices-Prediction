chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-1150,
baldwin
against
fish
and
game
commission
of
montana.
mr.
goetz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
analogize
this
to
your
legal
tie-in
sale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
the
mortality
rate
of
elk
is
not
very
high
with
bows
and
arrows,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
could
preempt
this
area
with
exclusive
license
or
would
they
have
to
do
it
concurrently
with
the
states
as
with
the
duck
standpoint
of
state
license.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
goetz.
mr.
lenzini.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
distinguish
between
a
state's
interest
in
wild
game
as
a
resource
to
use
that
term
and
subsurface
minerals
and
energy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
different
partly
because
the
minerals
can
not
migrate
but
the
game
again,
would
that
be
a
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
preceding
on
a
premise
that
title
much
rest
somewhere,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
wildlife
is
not
capable
of
ownership
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
definition
it
is
not
wildlife
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
arguing
that
a
rancher
who
is
paying
montana
state
taxes
on
his
land
and
whose
land
is
then
used
by
elks
and
others
is
entitled
to
sort
of
special
protection
and
which
can
not
be
measured
mathematically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
they
are
contributing
something
to
the
well
being
of
the
elks
which
nonresidents
do
not
contribute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
the
legislature
assert
this
conservation
aspect
in
order
to
rely
on
it
and
the
passage
of
the
statute
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
it
was
about
to
a
little
less
than
half
of
the
31,000.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
baldwin
against
fish
&
game
commission
of
montana
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
