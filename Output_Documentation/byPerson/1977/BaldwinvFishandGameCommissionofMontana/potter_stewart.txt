there
were
no
elk
in
the
east
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
saying,
just
before
you
proceed
that
the
total
number
of
non-resident
elk
hunters
is
limited
to
a
figure
of
17,000
and
what
they
would
be
drawn
by
a
lot
if
there
were
more
than
that
many
applicants?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
never
been
necessary
to
determine
--
justice
potter
stewart
and,
a
fortiori,
if
montana
should
say
that
there
should
be
no
non-resident
hunters,
only
our
residents
should
hunt
out.
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that
under
the
privilege
and
immunities
clause,
that
that
cause
is
simply
inapplicable
because
this
right
is
the
right
that
is
not
recreation,
it
is
not
covered
by
that
clause.
but
non
constant,
the
equal
protection
clause
is
applicable
because
it
need
not
be
any
kind
of
a
right
for
equal
protection
analysis
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
equal
protection
clause
has
to
do
with
classifications.
justice
potter
stewart
toomer
against
witsell
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
your
answer
mr.
lenzini
to
my
borther
marshall's
question
indicated
your
belief
that
this
relatively
high
license
fee
actually
operated
as
a
real
disincentive
to
nonresident
hunting
in
montana.
do
you
think
that
is
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
my
observation
as
well
as
i
may
say
personal
experience
has
been
in
this
sort
of
recreation
is
quite
an
extravagant
pursuit
monetarily
and
that
the
$200
fee
is
rather
small
fraction
of
the
overall
cost
and
would
probably
not
in
fact
operate
as
much
of
a
disincentive
to
the
kind
of
person
who
comes
from
outside
of
montana
and
comes
in
there
and
hires
a
guy,
normally
outfitting
material
necessary
and
indulges
in
big
game
hunting,
is
that
correct,
am
i
quite
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
not
a
disincentive
and
to
the
extent
it
is
not
a
disincentive,
your
case
is
weakened
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
see
any
threat,
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
does
not
discourage
any
non
residents
from
coming
in
and
hunting
elk,
then
you
have
no
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
there
is
a
limit
of
17,000.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
said
there
was
a
limit
of
$17,000.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
not
many
residents
in
montana.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
not
many
adult
male
residents
in
montana,
compared
to
the
other,
to
the
total
of
the
other
49
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
generally
that
is
there.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
population
in
montana?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
state
men,
women
and
children?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
license
to
hunt
tigers
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
in
very
early
in
your
argument,
is
this
not
really
one
problem.
let
us
say
that
montana
had
said
that
in
order
to
hunk
elk,
you
also
had
to
be
licensed
to
tigers
and
elephants
and
zebras.
in
other
words,
wholly
unrealistic,
but
that
is
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
an
elk
license,
and
you
have
to
pay
$225
for
it.
is
this
not
realistically
the
same
as
though
they
set
it
to
$225
fee?
