mr.
wallace,
you
say
you
cannot
patent
the
pythagorean
theorem
but
do
you
say
a
transit
used
in
surveying
is
not
patentable
just
because
it
employs
the
pythagorean
theorem
to
accomplish
its
result?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
claim
here
did
not
address
itself
to
any
of
the
equipment
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
saw
a
patent
with
the
algorithm
and
the
conventional
alarm
adjusting
equipment,
he
could
not
have
been
turned
down
solely
on
the
basis
that
the
whole
thing
was
non-patentable
subject
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
if
a
claim
included
not
only
the
algorithm
but
the
machinery
for
putting
the
algorithm
to
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
i
went
tomorrow
to
the
patent
office
and
applied
for
a
patent
on
the
telephone,
i
assume
i
would
be
turned
down
but
not
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
non-patentable
subject
matter
but
on
the
grounds
it
was
not
novel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
is
not
the
only
one
that
feels
that
way
about
benson
isn't
it?
