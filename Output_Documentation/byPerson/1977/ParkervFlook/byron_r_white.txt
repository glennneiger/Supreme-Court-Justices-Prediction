mr.
wallace,
do
you
think
this
patent
would
foreclose
use
of
this
algorithm
for
any
other
possible
imaginable
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
is
the
argument
is
just
how
to
construe
the
claims?
is
that
all
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
court
is
legally
wrong
even
if
it
is
true
what
they
said
here?
what
i
just
read
to
you?
let
assume
that
is
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
let
us
assume,
that
it
is
correct
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
present
claims
do
not
preempt
the
formula
or
algorithm
contained
there
in
because
the
solutions
of
the
algorithm
per
se
would
not
infringe
the
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
just
say
they
solved
it
and
found
another
use
for
it,
would
it
infringe
these
claims
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
would
not
and
if
you
agree
with
that,
that
it
would
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
remember
the
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
construed
this
patent
as
though
it
were
just
a
application
for
a
patent
for
a
peace
of
machinery?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
just
an
ordinary
process
application.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
using
the
algorithm
that
is
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
that
categorization
of
the
cases?
i
would
not
think
you
would,
but
do
you
agree
with
that
type
of
placement
of
christenson?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
other
uses?
