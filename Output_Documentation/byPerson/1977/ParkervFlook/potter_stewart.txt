it

isn't
it?
can't
you
have
a
combination
patent
on
a
process
as
well
as
on
a
product?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
this
is
clearly,
it
is
a
combination
and
this
is
one
element
of
a
combination.
the
force
of
gravity
is
not
patentable
but
if
some
inventor
came
in
or
some
applicant
for
a
patent
came
in
and
showed
a
combination
process
and
using
gravity
as
one
element
that
always
before
had
been
used
by
manpower
or
electric
power
or
gasoline
power,
he
could
patent
that
combination,
even
though
all
the
other
elements
were
old.

justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
what
it
clearly
is,
isn't
it?
it
is
a
series
of
steps.
maybe
combination
is
not
the
right
word.
i
am
not
an
expert
patent
lawyer
but
it
is
a
series
of
steps
in
a
process
is
it
not?
justice

stewart
exactly,
it
is
a
method
or
process
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
a
process
consisting
of
several
steps,
only
one
of
which
is
thisâ€¦
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
it
is.
most
products
are
combination
of
elements.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
about
my
hypothetical
case
about
an
applicant
for
a
patent?
process
patents,
using
the
force
of
gravity
where
always
before
manpower
or
electric
power
had
been
used
to
produce
what
he
says
is
a
superior
effect
to
the
prior
art
because
this
gravity
in
combination
with
the
known
and
old
element
has
synergistic
effect,
would
that
be
a
valid
process
application
for
a
process
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
gravity
itself
is
not
patentable.
justice

justice

stewart
it

justice

there
is

justice

justice

of

justice
potter
stewart
in
this

the
application,
the
consideration
never

beyond

justice

stewart
if
something
is
not
patentable
under
101,
one
never
gets
to
102
or
103.
justice

then
one
moves
to

and

justice

what
was
the
opinion

the

that
you

justice

i
cannot

to

justice

stewart
that
is
a
court
of
appeals'
opinion
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
the
claiming
of
such
per
se.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case,
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
it
is
a
common
place
that
laws
of
nature,
physical
phenomenon
and
abstract
ideas
are
not
patentable
subject
matter.
a
patent
could
not
issue,
in
other
words,
on
the
law
of
gravity
or
the
multiplication
tables
or
the
phenomenon
of
magnetism
or
the
fact
that
water
at
sea-level
boils
at
a
100
degree
centigrade
and
freezes
at
0,
even
though
newly
discovered.
the
recent
case
to
which
my
brother
stevens
has
just
referred,
the
case
of
gottschalk
against
benson,
reported
in
volume
409
of
the
united
states
reports,
stands
for
no
more
than
this
long
established
principle.
the
present
case,
however,
is
a
far
different
one.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
claimed
process
loses
its
status
of
subject
matter
patentability
simply
because
one
step
in
the
process
would
not
be
patentable
subject
matter,
if
considered
in
isolation.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
held
that
the
process
is
patentable
subject
matter
and
that
decision
seems
to,
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
to
me,
as
wholly
and
conformity
with
basic
principles
of
patent
law.
indeed,
and
i
suppose
that
thousands
of
patents
have
been
issued
over
the
years
that
contained
one
or
more
steps
or
elements
that
themselves
in
isolation
would
have
been
unpatentable
subject
matter.
the
eibel
process
case
reported
in
261
of
the
united
states
reports
is
a
case
directly
in
point
illustrating
this
truism.
there
the
court
upheld
the
validity
of
an
improvement
patent
that
may
use
the
law
of
gravity
which
by
itself,
of
course,
was
clearly
unpatentable.
it
may
well
be,
that
under
the
criteria
of
other
provisions
of
the
patent
law,
specifically
sections
102
and
103,
no
patent
should
issue
on
the
process
claimed
in
this
case
because
of
anticipation
or
obviousness
or
for
some
other
statutory
reason,
but
in
our
view,
the
claimed
process
clearly
meets
the
standards
of
subject
matter
patentability
under
the
provisions
of
section
101
of
the
statute.
