mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
attempt
in
the
time
given
to
me
to
perform
a
dual
role
if
i
may.
my
primary
and
principal
role
is
of
course
as
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
my
client
to
seek
a
basis
for
the
granting
of
a
patent
to
mr.
flook,
but
my
second
role
and
i
think
of
equal
and
if
not
surpassing
importance
is
to
attempt
to
clarify
the
true
significance
of
what
appears
to
be
according
to
a
petitioner
a
dispute
on
whether
a
given
patent
is
patentable.
i
think
it
goes
far
beyond
that.
the
applicant
flook
find
himself
in
the
awkward
circumstance
of
being
in
the
middle
of
a
crossfire
between
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
the
united
states
patent
office.
if
the
applicant
adheres
to
and
abides
by
the
clear
decisions
which
have
evolved
over
a
period
of
successive
cases
since
benson.
he
finds
himself
rejected
by
the
patent
office.
if
he
seeks
regress
from
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
he
finds
that
the
patent
office
still
disagrees
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
proper
test
to
be
applied
to
section
101.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
evolved
through
a
series
of
well
reasoned
decisions
of
proper
application
of
the
test
of
benson
and
that
test
is
the
practical
effect
test.
examining
the
invention
as
claimed
and
examining
the
claim
in
its
entirety.
do
we
have
simply
an
exercise
in
manipulating
the
english
language
by
ingenious
patent
draftsman?
is
the
effect
of
the
claim
cruelly
to
attempt
to
appropriate
a
category
of
subject
matter
that
is
not
qualified
by
the
congress
under
section
101?
if
that
is
the
case,
if
the
impractical
effect,
all
that
is
being
claimed
is
a
non-statutory
category
of
subject
matter,
it
must
be
rejected.
what
the
patent
office
would
do
here
is
to
substitute
an
entirely
new
theory,
a
new
test,
an
inventiveness
of
implementation
test.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
interpret
what
an
inventiveness
of
implementation
test
is
if
it
is
not…
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
they
have
argued
for
that
type
of
test
in
previous
cases
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
it
is
new
before
this
court.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
no,
but
they
have
been
repeatedly
overruled
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
when
they
have
attempted
to
apply
such
a
test.
the
recent
decisions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
show
how
that
contest
has
evolved
and
if
i
may
your
honors,
there
is
a
very
current
decision
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
as
yet
unpublished
which
was
unavailable
for
us
to
sight
in
our
briefs,
but
which
i
think
the
court
might
make
reference
to
if
for
no
other
purposes
than
to
ascertain
what
is
the
position
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
benson
doctrine
and
that
is
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
matter
of
the
application
of
richard
don
freeman
appeal
number
75-531.
the
court
of
customs
and
patents
appeal--
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
that
was
decided
on
march
30,
1978.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
the
number
75-531.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
matter
of
the
application
of
richard
don
freeman.
in
a
series
of
decisions
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
there
was
specific
consideration
of
the
individual
claim
and
an
attempt
in
the
light
of
benson
to
ascertain
whether
as
a
matter
of
practical
effect
there
was
a
cleaning,
an
attempt
to
appropriate
and
preempt
that
category
of
subject
matter,
a
mathematical
algorithm
as
such
which
cannot
be
patented.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
basic
concept
of
the
law
enunciated
in
funk.
the
congress
simply
did
not
intend
that
discoverers
those
who
learn
for
the
first
time
of
an
existing
phenomenon
of
nature
and
expressed
it
in
the
form
of
a
mathematical
expression
we
are
entitled
to
a
patent.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
that
congress
could
have
awarded
patent
grants
for
such
discoveries
had
it
chosen
to
do
so
within
the
constitutional
power.
they
chose
not.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
certainly
the
way
it
has
evolved
it
is
different,
your
honor.
enacting
the
patent
statute
the
congress
made
it
clear
in
its
first
several
sections
of
the
statute,
what
its
plan
and
pattern
was.
first
in
section
100,
the
definitions.
an
invention
is
described
there.
it
is
defined
with
a
circular
definition.
invention
means
discovery,
but
i
think
that
congress
was
attempting
to
say,
invention
means
what
we
all
know
it
to
me.
it
has
just
got
its
common
english
language
meaning.
that
is
different
from
patentable
invention.
now
we
must
determine
whether
it
qualifies
for
patenting.
in
section
101,
they
said
whoever
invents
or
discovers
may
qualify
for
patenting
if
the
nature
of
this
subject
matter
falls
within
the
certain
defying
categories
and
the
congress
said
a
process,
a
machine,
a
manufacture,
composition
of
matter,
or
improvements
in
them.
now,
the
discoverer
of
a
previously
unrevealed
natural
principle
simply
does
not
qualify
under
those
categories
and
no
matter
how
he
may
attempt
to
express
it
if
what
he
is
seeking
to
patent
is
simply
the
discovery
of
this
existing
phenomenon.
however,
important
that
may
be
he
cannot
patent
it.
the
example
that
we
like
to
use,
because
it
has
a
little
bit
of
drama
to
it
is
einstein’s
e=mc2.
an
extraordinary
discovery
of
the
human
mind,
certainly
it
contributed
immensely
to
science
and
its
evolvement,
but
it
simply
would
not
be
patentable
under
the
patent
statute.
now,
let
us
suppose
you
attempt
to
patent
e=mc2
by
converting
it
into
the
sequence
of
steps
of
a
process,
but
if
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
process
you
have
defined
has
no
practical
application
except
the
solving
of
that
equation
to
determine
how
much
energy
there
is
in
a
given
quantity
of
mass,
it
is
not
patentable.
what
this
court
said
in
benson
was
to
reestablish
clearly
and
unmistakably
that
vital
principle.
“he
who
discovers
a
hitherto
unknown
phenomenon
of
nature
has
no
claim
to
a
monopoly
of
it
which
the
law
recognizes.
if
there
is
to
be
invention
from
such
a
discovery,
it
must
come
from
the
application
of
the
law
of
nature
to
a
new
and
useful
result."
if
the
commissioner
suggests
that
there
must
be
an
inventiveness
of
implementation
test,
he
applies
a
terribly
discriminatory
standard
to
an
inventor
who
has
discovered
an
old
phenomenon
but
discovered
it
for
the
first
time.
his
task
is
far
more
difficult
than
the
putterer
in
the
laboratory
who
may
just
chance
upon
something
and
not
have
the
faintest
idea
why
it
works.
if
i
can
illustrate
that,
the
inventor
who
understands
and
is
the
first
to
discover
a
phenomenon
of
nature,
who
ascertains
and
can
set
forth
for
the
public
knowledge
and
underlying
scientific
principle
would
be
barred
by
his
own
implementation
of
that,
however
new
his
implementation
might
be
because
the
patent
office
would
say
he
is
simply
doing
what
would
naturally
evolve
from
the
suggestion
of
the
principle
in
effect,
this
is
tantamount
to
claiming
the
principle.
whereas
one
who
did
not
know
the
principle
did
not
discover
it
and
attempted
to
define
a
use
of
it
would
not
be
so
barred.
the
inventiveness
of
implementation
tests
also
disregards
how
to
compare
the
inventor's
contribution
with
the
prior
art.
the
congress
said
in
the
1952
act,
it
must
not
only
be
new
and
useful
and
an
invention,
but
it
must
be
an
invention
in
patentable
sense
which
we
say
to
me
according
to
the
prior
cases
un-obvious
to
one
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
it
must
also
in
its
usefulness
not
have
been
disqualified
form
patentability,
so
we
have
two
additional
sections;
we
have
section
102
that
lists
the
disqualifications.
if
the
subject
matter
had
become
known
to
the
public
in
someway,
if
it
is
in
a
printed
article,
public
use,
on
sale,
no
matter
how
inventive
it
may
have
been
it
maybe
too
late
to
get
a
patent.
hence,
it
is
disqualified.
under
103,
we
must
now
compare
the
invention
assuming
it
is
not
disqualified
with
the
prior
art
and
focusing
upon
difference
with
regard
to
the
invention
as
a
whole,
we
must
ascertain
whether
it
would
have
been
not
obvious
to
one
of
ordinary
skill.
here
if
the
inventiveness
of
implementation
test
is
applied
rather
than
the
practical
effect
doctrine
of
benson,
we
have
an
inventor
hoist
on
his
petard.
he
is
damned
by
his
own
discovery.
he
is
not
one
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
he
is
the
discoverer
and
the
inventor.
if
you
say,
well,
he
knew
the
basic
underlying
principle
so
his
implementation
would
naturally
follow,
he
is
in
a
worse
position
than
the
man
who
did
not
discover
the
underlying
principle.
this
is
not
an
appropriate
standard
to
apply
it
and
the
correct
standard
is
the
103
standard.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
was
coming
to
that
your
honor,
if
i
may
get
a
copy
of
103
before
me?
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
have
been
getting
lost
with
the
number
of
briefs
and
i
do
know
my
way
through
my
copy
of
the
statute
book.
patentability
shall
not
be
negative
by
the
manner
in
which
the
invention
was
made.
this
is
an
extremely
important
aspect
of
the
statute,
an
expressed
provision
of
103.
if
the
inventor
is
to
be
measured
by
the
inventiveness
of
the
implementation
of
that
which
he
has
discovered,
he
is
not
being
accorded
the
benefits
of
the
condition
of
103.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
drew
the
inference
perhaps
erroneously
that
the
112
rejection
having
been
made
and
having
been
overcome
resulted
in
fall
back
rejection
under
101.
the
101
rejection
was
made
at
the
very
outset.
it
was
persisted
in
throughout
the
prosecution.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
if
one
qualifies
under
the
categories
capable
of
being
patented
under
101.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
one
of
the
strongest
criticism
raised
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
with
regard
to
the
commissioners
test,
is
that
the
commissioner
dissects
the
claim.
he
says
there
is
an
algorithm
in
this
claim.
there
is
an
equation
in
this
claim
and
that
as
such
is
un-patentable,
we
acknowledge
that.
but
then
he
says
but
the
balance
of
the
claim
and
all
of
this
other
steps
are
straight
forward,
routine,
and
therefore
because
the
point
of
novelty
is
non
statutory,
we
will
reject
the
claim
as
a
whole.
not
so,
says
the
ccpa
and
not
so
we
say
on
behalf
of
the
applicant
flook,
you
must
examine
the
claim
in
its
entirety.
you
must
look
at
all
of
the
steps.
you
must
look
at
it
in
its
total
environment.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
re-answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
put
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
justice
marshall
looked
with
some
horror
at
the
formulae
set
forth
in
the
claim
and
asked
that
you
do
not
want
me
to
get
involved
with
that
and
that
is
correct
you’re
honor.
and
that
is
correct
your
honor,
you
need
not
focus
on
a
particular
equation.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
see,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
we
must
look
at
the
claim
as
a
whole
and
the
claim
is
a
sequence
of
steps
which
happens
to
also
include
an
algorithm
and
an
equation.
that
algorithm
and
an
equation,
we
do
not
concede
as
old.
the
algorithm
is
novel.
there
is
no
rejection
that
it
is
not
novel.
in
fact,
it
is
conceded
that
it
is
the
point
of
novelty.
it
is
not
an
old
equation
because
the
values
assigned
to
it
are
uniquely
assigned
for
the
specific
purpose
of
this
invention.
the
steps
of
solving
the
algorithm
or
solving
the
equation
by
means
of
the
algorithm
however
we
state
it
has
not
been
done
before.
there
is
no
contention
that
it
is
an
old
algorithm.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes,
indeed.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
must
speculate
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
because
that
patent
office
takes
the
view
that
any
claim
which
utilizes
an
algorithm
is
in
the
nature
of
a
programmable
computer
type
of
claim
and
they
simply
are
not
equipped
to
examine
that
type
of
subject
matter
and
this
is
a
convenient
handle
for
rejection.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
it
has
been
so
stated
that
that
is
what
benson
stands
for.
i
believe
it
does
not
stand
for
that.
i
believe
the
case
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
did
not
so
state.
indeed
even
some
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
have
been
dissenting
opinions
stated
that
that
is
what
benson
stands
for
but
i
do
not
believe
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
believe
this
court
in
benson
said
that
all
programmable
computer
inventions
are
not
patentable.
in
benson,
we
had
the
classic
example
that
fits
the
funk
rule.
we
had
two
kinds
of
numbering
systems.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
not
at
all
and
claim
one
does
not
specify
there
should
be
a
computer.
indeed,
your
honor,
no
claim
so
specifies.
there
was
no
use
of
the
word
computer,
program
or
software
in
any
of
the
claims.
claim
three
i
believe
it
says
automatically.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
that
would
be
the
petitioner’s
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
it
does
not.
it
has
to
do
with
the
basic
concept
that
a
mathematical
expression
of
a
fundamental
truth
or
scientific
principle
is
not
patentable,
we
concede
that.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
certainly,
that
is
the
funk
rule.
that
is
the
foundation
for
this
court’s
ruling
in
benson.
benson
says,
let
us
not
be
deceived.
let
us
look
deep
into
the
claim.
let
us
see
if
has
really
condemned
a
la
funk
or
whether
in
fact
some
new
process
is
being
claimed.
if
it
is
no
more
than
a
fundamental
principle
of
nature
in
the
clothes
of
a
process,
it
still
is
not
statutory
subject
matter
and
in
benson,
clearly
the
relationship
between
the
two
numbering
systems
was
old
and
existed.
it
is
a
fundamental
unknown
concept
discovered
by
a
particular
applicant.
when
he
then
attempts
to
translate
one
into
the
other,
he
is
just
utilizing
that
concept
for
that
sole
purpose
and
in
effect
would
be
preempting
the
relationship
between
the
new
numbering
systems
which
is
not
capable
of
being
preempted.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
its
decision
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
of
de
castelet
which
is
reported
at
562
f.2d
1236,
chief
judge
markey
rendering
the
opinion
of
the
court
pointed
out
that
since
benson,
they
had
attempted
to
evolve
a
standard.
they
stated
that
it
was
clear
from
their
point
of
view
that
the
nutshell
language
of
benson
simply
expressed
the
ancient
rule
but
practical
application
remains
the
key.
what
have
you
done
with
this
discovery
of
an
old
concept?
they
concluded
that
in
the
benson
case,
the
court
had
simply
said
that
sum
and
substance
of
the
claim
however
characterized
was
in
effect
claiming
the
basic
principle.
the
court
then
said
if
i
may
read,
the
distinction
may
thus
be
fine
indeed
between
statutory
and
non-statutory
subject
matter
considering
the
glorious
flexibility
and
frustrating
limitations
of
the
english
language
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ingenuity
of
patent
draftsman
on
the
other.
nonetheless,
the
line
required
by
precedent
and
which
must
here
be
drawn
is
clear,
the
mathematical
expression
of
scientific
truth
or
principle
is
not
itself
patentable.
they
concluded
by
pointing
out
that
the
case
before
them,
de
castelet,
fell
on
that
side
of
the
statutory,
non-statutory
line
occupied
and
then
they
recited
their
string
of
cases.
on
the
one
side,
un-patentable
because
not
qualified
under
the
statutory
requirement
of
101
were
the
morse
case,
benson,
their
case
in
christensen
and
the
wall,
bowman,
richman
decisions.
on
the
other
side
of
this
fine
line,
however,
where
the
effect
of
the
claim
is
not
to
appropriate
a
scientific
principle,
under
the
guise
of
a
statutory
process,
where
the
decisions
by
the
ccpa
in
chatfield,
deutsch
and
flook.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
examined
the
facts
in
each
of
them
your
honor
and
i
struggled
a
bit
with
christensen
and
i
believe
the
common
denominator
in
the
un-patentable
cases
is
that
however
it
is
being
characterized,
it
is
something
that
was
old,
maybe
not
known,
but
old,
whereas
in
the
cases
which
did
qualify
for
patentability,
there
was
not
that
oldness
to
the
concept
that
was
being
described.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
believe
under
101,
old
means
it
is
there
in
the
public
domain.
it
has
existed
but
it
may
be
undiscovered.
it
may
not
previously
have
been
revealed
but
nevertheless,
it
is
part
of
the
scientific
tools.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
rather
than
not
in
the
public
domain,
it
is
not
capable
of
being
patented.
it
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
categories
of
101.
in
102,
however,
we
now,
deal
with
old
in
a
different
way.
old
in
the
sense
that
the
public
knows
about
it
by
some
means.
it
is
now
prior
art.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
this
one
meaning
what
your
honor?
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
the
algorithm
in
that
case,
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that
that
is
an
old
algorithm.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
do
not
even
believe
it
is
that
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
is
like
benson’s
algorithm
at
all.
this
is
simply
the
manipulating
of
certain
values
by
the
inventor
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
manipulated
before?
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes,
your
honor
and
then
to
apply
it
to
some
useful
and
practical
purpose.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
de
castelet,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
perhaps
my
colleague
can
find
the

but
the
citation
is
562
f.2d
1236.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
with
respect
to
the
eibel
decision
is
directly
in
point
with
regard
to
that
where
the
force
of
gravity
was
being
utilized
but
the
force
of
gravity
was
not
being
claimed.
it
was
the
novel
application
of
it
to
a
new
use
and
result
which
was
being
claimed.
every
invention
is
in
some
way
a
utilization
of
basic
concepts
and
principles
of
nature.
but
it
is
the
claiming
of
such
which
is
forbidden
even
though
newly
discovered.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
conclude
in
this
way,
in
the
freeman
case
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
which
was
newly
decided
and
yet
unreported
as
i
indicated
to
the
court,
a
test
was
suggested
there
which
i
think
makes
good
common
sense
and
seems
to
be
what
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
been
doing
ever
since
benson
and
talbot.
the
court
said
that
a
two
step
analysis
is
appropriate
to
determine
whether
there
is
qualification
under
section
101.
first,
it
must
be
determined
whether
the
claim
directly
or
indirectly
recites
an
algorithm
in
the
benson
sense
of
that
term.
the
benson
sense
of
that
term
meaning
the
mathematical
expression
of
an
old
principle
even
though
it
may
have
previously
been
undiscovered.
second,
the
claim
must
then
be
analyzed
to
ascertain
whether
in
its
entirety,
not
dissected
for
some
alleged
point
of
novelty
but
whether
the
claim
in
its
entirety
wholly
preempts
that
algorithm
and
under
the
facts
of
our
case
with
regard
to
mr.
flook
in
his
modest
invention
in
the
field
of
process
controls,
he
does
not
claim
an
algorithm
of
the
benson
sense.
we
do
not
concede
that
his
expression
of
the
equation
is
in
any
sense
an
old
expression.
there
is
no
rejection
of
novelty.
he
claims
it
in
a
very
specific
environment
like
catalytic
chemical
hydrocarbon
conversion
process.
he
does
not
attempt
to
claim
all
other
uses.
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
would
this
patent
foreclose
use
of
this
algorithm
for
other
uses.
it
certainly
would
not.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
yes
your
honor.
the
petitioner’s
brief
at
appendix
page
8a
suggests
many
such
other
uses.
i
would
have
to
step
outside
the
record
to
confirm
that
but
i
think
it
is
a
true
statement.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
is
automatically
patentable.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
contend
that
if
it
is
properly
claimed
and
if
the….
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
although
i
contend
that
is
not
the
case
in
flook,
i
will
accept
the
assumption
of
a
fact
situation
where
the
only
point
of
novelty
is
the
equation.
i
think
that
that
would
qualify
for
patent
examination
and
the
determination
must
be
is
the
use
of
that
algorithm
for
that
purpose
un-obvious?
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
determined.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
then
it
would
be
patentable.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
no,
your
honor.
because
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says
if
you
examine
them
in
their
entirety
to
see
what
has
really
been
done
and
you
apply
the
practical
effect
test
to
benson,
they
will
either
stand
or
fall
on
the
merits
of
the
contribution
that
has
been
made
in
applying
it.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
i
think
the
decisions
of
the
ccpa
in
deutsch
which
is
cited
in
de
castelet
case
and
in
other
decisions
as
well
richman,
did
find
patentability
in
a
computer
software
application
to
a
new
use.
mr.
d.
dennis
allegretti
if
properly
claimed
so
as
to
qualify
under
101
in
the
way
in
which
i
have
been
describing
it,
i
think
the
way
it
is
determined
is
under
103.
is
it
an
obvious
use?
does
it
qualify
for
patentability
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
i
would
simply
sum
up
if
i
may
with
the
view
that
the
flook
claims
are
directed
to
a
series
of
combination
steps
and
the
statute
itself.
section
112
of
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
combination
step
inventions
including
process
inventions,
it
is
appropriate
to
claim
such
an
invention
in
a
combination
format.
the
practice
of
the
algorithm
that
is
included
in
that
combination
of
steps
in
and
of
itself
would
not
infringe
the
claim
that
is
not
being
preempted
and
appropriated.
the
claim
is
not
to
some
use
west
of
the
mississippi.
it
is
very
explicit.
it
is
in
a
catalytic,
chemical
conversion
process
with
hydrocarbons.
it
is
a
process
that
has
never
been
performed
before,
the
use
of
the
algorithm
for
this
purpose
has
never
been
done
before.
if
it
is
un-obvious,
it
should
clearly
be
patentable
and
capable
of
being
examined
for
patentability
in
accordance
with
section
101
of
statute.
thank
you,
your
honors.
