justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there
with
a
question.
supposing
that
instead
of
this
complicated
formula,
you
just
had
a
formula
4
divided
by
2
equals
2
right
in
there
and
that
was
not
new.
could
you
nevertheless
claim
that
even
though
1,
2,
3,
and
4
were
all
old,
that
the
combination
of
1,
2,
3,
and
4
was
in
fact
new
and
therefore
patentable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
all
the
emphasis
on
novelty
if
one
element,
when
the
element
question
as
i
understand
is
a
novelty
of
the
entire
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allegretti,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
if
i
may.
just
looking
at
claim
one,
it
would
not
necessarily
have
to
use
a
computer
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
government’s
position,
as
i
understand
it,
i
suppose
this
perhaps
should
be
addressed
to
mr.
wallace,
if
you
had
a
man
watching
the
process
that
he
found
out
that
you
could
divide
the
temperature
by
the
pressure
or
take
half
the
difference
of
something
and
then
push
another
button
and
it
was
brand
new
and
it
worked,
that
could
not
be
patentable
because
there
is
some
mathematical
computation
took
place
in
the
process,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
really
have
anything
to
do
with
software
as
i
understand
the
underlying
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
the
other
side
of
the
coin
for
a
moment?
does
your
position
mean
that
every
time
a
software
person
is
requested
to
solve
a
particular
problem
and
in
this
case,
how
to
compute
a
new
alarm
and
limit
or
adjust
it
or
something,
how
to
figure
out
how
much
fuel
to
be
added
to
the
process
or
something
like
that,
the
problem
has
not
been
worked
out
with
computers
before,
the
idea
that
if
you
work
it
out
is
obvious,
he
comes
up
with
some
mathematical
formula
that
will
solve
that
particular
problem.
it
was
not
obvious
because
it
took
him
five
weeks
to
work
out
a
lot
of
tough
mathematics
and
it
was
new
and
nobody
has
done
it
before.
it
is
automatically
patentable.
every
computer
solution,
every
software
solution
to
a
new
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
their
argument
as
i
have
said,
they
seek
to
direct
our
attention
to
a
case
in
which
the
only
point
of
novelty
is
the
new
formula.
the
new
algorithm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
use
of
the
algorithm
would
have
been
un-obvious
because
he
had
to
work
it
out.
it
was
new.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
is
not
every
new
software
not
patentable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume,
well
every
new
software
program
that
has
some
practical
value
is
worth
spending
enough
money
to
hire
somebody
to
work
for
six
weeks
to
find
the
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
saying
it
is
necessarily
wrong
but
i
do
not
really
see
where
we
draw
the
line
between
new
software
that
is
patentable
and
new
software
that
is
not
patentable
when
it
is
produced
in
response
to
some
kind
of
industry
request
that
is
for
a
particular
answer
to
a
particular
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
wallace,
in
this
particular
patent,
this
relates
to
conversion
of
hydrocarbons,
you
would
not
say
the
patent
would
preclude
the
use
of
this
algorithm
to
make
bathtubs
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question
about
the
government's
position
i
am
not
entirely
clear
on.
if
not
only
the
algorithm
were
novel
and
new,
but
also
the
concept
of
using
any
algorithm
to
compute
adjustable
alarm
elements
was
also
new,
would
the
government
say
that
that
fact
that
a
new
algorithm
was
used
disqualified
the
entire
process
from
being
patentable
subject
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
novelty
--.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
try
to
listen
to
my
question.
if
there
is
novelty
in
the
end
use
and
also
novelty
in
an
algorithm,
that
is
part
of
the
process,
is
the
subject
matter
patentable
in
the
government’s
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
novelty
and
importance
of
this
case,
i
would
take
a
few
minutes
to
explain
it.
it
is
a
patent
case,
which
comes
here
by
somewhat
unusual
procedure.
the
patent
examiner
denied
an
application
for
a
patent
and
was
sustained
by
the
board
of
review
that
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
that
court
held
that
the
patent
application
should
have
been
granted.
the
acting
commissioner
of
patents
then
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
represented
that
the
ruling
in
this
case
might
affect
the
patent
ability
of
thousands
of
other
patent
applications
that
concern
computer
software,
an
area
in
which
the
court
has
had
a
little
to
say
before
this
case
and
we
granted
certiorari
based
on
the
representations
of
the
acting
commissioner
of
patents.
the
patent
is
one,
on
a
method
for
updating
an
alarm
limit.
an
alarm
limit
is
a
number
and
i
might
explain
it
this
way.
in
the
petrochemical
industry,
in
the
oil
refining
industry,
there
are
some
catalytic
conversion
processes
that
are
carried
on
at
high
temperatures
and
under
great
pressures,
and
cause
both
danger
and
loss
of
efficiency
if
there
is
a
significant
deviation
from
the
norm.
for
example,
you
might
expect
you
have
a
temperature
of
400
degrees
and
the
safety
margin
of
say
50
degrees
and
if
the
temperature
get
above
450
degrees,
there
might
be
some
need
to
change
the
process.
if
that
should
happen,
the
450
degree
figure
would
be
the
alarm
limit
and
when
the
alarm
limit
would
be
reached
for
that
pressure
or
that
temperature,
say,
then
an
alarm
would
go
off
and
the
operator
would
make
some
change
in
the
functioning
of
the
system
and
in
some
of
these
systems,
they
don't
have
a
constant
alarm
limit,
but
rather
there
are
changes
in
the
processes
so
it's
periodically
important
to
change
the
alarm
limit.
as
doing
a
start
up
of
an
operation,
for
example,
the
temperatures
may
gradually
increase
and
the
necessity
for
triggering
the
alarm
will
change
as
the
pressures
go
up.
the
patent
application
covers
a
procedure
for
updating
the
alarm
limit
during
these
changes
in
processes
of
--
in
these
particular
industries.
and
the
patent
covers
basically
a
series
of
steps
for
computing
a
new
number.
it
requires
a
monitoring
of
the
process
variable,
the
temperature,
the
pressure,
the
flow
of
material,
the
catalytic
bit,
whatever
it
might
be,
it's
monitored
constantly
and
periodically
there
is
a
change
made
in
the
alarm
limit.
the
change
is
made
by
taking
the
preceding
normal
operating
temperature
which
is
called
the
alarm
base,
in
the
most
recent
measurement
of
the
process
variable
that
is
of
interest,
say,
that
the
temperature
is
gone
from
400
to
450,
you
put
the
400
to
the
prior
norm
into
the
computer,
or
into
your
calculations,
and
take
the
more
recent
measurement
of
450
and
then
a
series
of
calculations
are
made
that
produce
an
average
between
those
two,
that
varies
depending
on
the
process
and
one
thing
another
and
then,
that
new
average
between
those
two
numbers
becomes
a
new
alarm
limit.
the
invention
in
this
case
consist
of
the
formula
by
which
that
calculation
is
made.
it
does
not
include
any
change
in
the
method
of
monitoring
the
process
variables
or
in
the
method
of
causing
the
alarm
to
go
off
or
anything
to
do
with
the
process
itself.
it's
merely
a
new
method
of
making
the
calculation
that
produces
this
new
number.
the
application
for
a
patent
was
filed
describing
it
as
a
method
of
updating
the
alarm
limit
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
such
a
method
is
a
process
within
the
meaning
of
section
101
of
the
patent
code,
which
determines
what
kinds
of
matter
maybe
given
patent
protection.
a
few
years
ago,
the
court
held
that
a
mathematical
formula
which
some
have
referred
to
as
an
algorithm
is
like
a
law
of
nature
and
may
not
itself
be
patented.
laws
of
nature
such
as
the
pythagorean
theorem
or
the
law
of
gravity
or
certain
fundamental
laws
of
nature
are
treated
as
though
they
are
part
of
the
public
domain
at
all
times,
and
may
not
become
the
subject
of
a
patent.
in
this
case,
the
applicant
does
not
claim
that
he
wants
a
monopoly
on
this
mathematical
formula.
he
claims
a
monopoly
on
the
used
of
the
mathematical
formula
in
computing
this
particular
new
number
for
use
in
a
limited
area,
namely
the
changing
of
alarm
limits
in
a
petrochemical
industry
and
the
petroleum
refining
industry
and
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
that
the
mathematical
formula
itself
cannot
be
patented,
makes
it
impossible
for
a
process
which
includes
the
mathematical
formula
as
the
only
novel
element
in
the
process
to
be
patented.
the
court
holds
that
this
is
not
patentable
subject
matter
and
the
reasoning,
goes
something
like
this.
that
in
a
case,
involving
the
patent
on
a
telegraph
of
samuel
morse
many
years
ago,
the
court
considered
some
of
these
problems
and
mentioned
that
when
you
have
a
principle,
in
that
case,
it
was
the
fact
that
hot
air
is
somewhat
is
a
higher
temperature
than
cold
air,
there
was
an
older
english
case
involved
there,
the
court
commented
on
the
existence
of
the
natural
law
and
said
that
we
think
the
case
must
be
considered
as
if
the
principle,
that's
the
natural
law
or
in
this
case,
the
mathematical
formula,
being
well
known,
the
plaintiff
had
first
invented
a
mode
of
applying
it.
as
we
understand,
the
basic
reasoning
behind
this
it
is
you
--
the
natural
law
or
in
this
case,
mathematical
formula
is
treated
as
though
it
were
already
a
part
of
the
prior
art
and
already
well
known
to
the
inventor.
and
if
one
makes
that
assumption
with
respect
to
this
process
application,
there
really
is
nothing
new
at
all
in
the
process
because
all
he
has
done
is
made
a
conventional
application
of
something
which
is
treated
as
though
it
had
always
been
well
known
because
the
natural
law
or
the
principle
itself
not
being
capable
of
discovery
within
the
meaning
of
section
101
of
the
patent
code.
therefore
a
process
which
does
--
adds
nothing
to
that
which
is
presumed
to
be
part
of
the
prior
art,
itself
cannot
be
patentable.
so
we
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
patent
should
not
issue
because
this
is
not
patentable
subject
matter
within
the
meaning
of
the
patent
code.
and
in
so
holding,
we
are
careful
to
point
out
that
we
are
limiting
our
holding
to
a
construction
of
the
statute
and
that
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
new
industry,
that
is
assumed
very
large
dimensions
in
recent
years
which
maybe
affected
by
the
holding
and
it
remains
within
the
power
of
congress
to
reexamine
this
area
and
to
determine
whether
or
not,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
give
patent
protection
to
computer
software
and
if
so
to
determine
what
the
duration
of
such
protection
would
be
and
that
is
the
holding
of
the
court
which
is
more
fully
explain
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
