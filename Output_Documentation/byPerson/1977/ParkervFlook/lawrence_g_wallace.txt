mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
reversed
a
decision
by
the
board
of
appeals
of
the
patent
trademark
office
which
had
sustained
the
patent
examiners
rejection
of
respondent’s
patent
claims
as
not
constituting
statutory
subject
matter
within
the
meaning
of
section
101
of
the
patent
code.
that
was
the
sole
ground
for
rejection
of
the
claim
for
sole
statutory
issue
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
the
only
statutory
section
that
is
before
the
court
now.
at
bottom,
the
board
of
appeals
and
the
court
differed
in
their
view
of
the
scope
and
meaning
of
this
court’s
decision
in
gottschalk
against
benson
409
us
63
which
also
involved
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
legal
principles
at
issue
in
the
case
are
fairly
straightforward
and
can
be
addressed
i
believe
without
detailed
discussion
of
the
technology
to
which
the
patent
claims
relate
in
this
case.
we
have
set
forth
some
description
of
that
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
now,
i
should
remind
you
of
that
the
benson
case
before
i
got
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
involved
a
process,
a
patent
claim
just
as
this
case
involved
a
process
patent
claim
and
that
in
benson,
the
claim
was
on
a
method
of
programming,
a
general
purpose
digital
computer
to
convert
signals
from
binary
coded
decimal
form
into
pure
binary
form,
another
form
of
mathematical
representation.
the
court
there
pointed
out
a
definition
of
the
word
'algorithm'
which
crops
up
in
these
cases
and
which
i
seldom
use
in
between
these
cases
and
have
a
tendency
to
forget
what
it
means
in
between
these
cases.
the
court
there
defined
an
algorithm
as
a
procedure
for
solving
a
given
type
of
mathematical
problem.
there
are
other
possible
definitions
of
algorithm
but
we
are
talking
about
mathematical
algorithms.
they
are
rather
similar
to
formulas
but
they
are
not
necessarily
formulas.
they
can
be
expressed
in
other
forms
but
they
are
procedures
for
solving
a
mathematical
problem
for
calculating
a
number
in
effect.
the
court
held
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
claims
in
benson
are
of
that
kind,
a
generalized
formulation
for
programs
to
solve
mathematical
problems
of
converting
one
form
of
numerical
representation
into
another
in
that
particular
case.
now,
the
present
case
similarly
involves
claim
of
novelty
in
a
mathematical
procedure.
here,
it
was
a
procedure
to
be
applied
to
familiar
technology
in
adjusting
what
are
called
the
alarm
limits
that
are
imposed
so
that
corrected
action
can
be
taken.
alarm
limits
on
process
variables
which
are
changeable
conditions
in
the
process
of
catalytic
conversion
of
hydrocarbons,
a
commercial
process
involved
in
hydro
cracking
and
the
like.
the
claims
are
set
forth
and
i
think
we
can
turn
to
the
claims
on
page
63a
of
the
appendix.
there
are
10
claims
altogether,
all
of
which
were
rejected
as
not
being
statutory
subject
matter.
i
should
add
that
in
one
of
the
amicus
presentations,
some
question
is
raised
about
whether
the
formula
set
forth
in
claim
on
the
series
of
mathematical
solutions
is
itself
novel.
no
such
question
was
decided
below.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
before
this
court.
in
its
present
posture
in
this
court,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
mathematical
representations
in
claim
one
are
novel.
that
question
would
be
open
to
the
examiner
on
remand,
should
the
decision
below
be
sustained
but
nobody
has
decided
it
yet
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
involved
in
the
details
of
these
equations.
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
what
it
is
that
the
claims
involve.
claim
one
is
the
only
independent
claim.
claims
two
through
10
are
all
dependent
upon
claim
one
and
state
claim
one
with
certain
end
use
limitations.
however,
none
of
those
limitations
involve
any
novelty
that
was
the
holding
of
the
patent
examiner
and
of
both
courts
below
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
admitted
in
the
abstract
that
the
respondents
submitted
along
with
his
claim
and
perhaps
the
most
telling
point
about
this
is
that
four
of
the
additional
claims
two
through
10
had
originally
been
rejected,
not
only
on
section
101
grounds
by
the
examiner
but
also
on
section
112
grounds
as
insufficient
specifications
to
disclose
to
people
familiar
with
the
art,
how
to
practice
the
invention.
in
a
petition
for
rehearing,
the
respondent
said,
no,
these
are
sufficiently
disclosed
because
they
are
all
conventional
technology
that
are
well
known
to
practitioners
of
the
art.
there
is
no
reason
to
have
to
spell
them
out
and
he
cited
previous
patents
and
other
technical
material
to
indicate
this.
on
page
44a
of
the
appendix
at
the
bottom,
he
sums
it
all
up
in
saying
that
the
means
are
conventional
and
well
known
in
the
art
and
therefore
these
specifications
are
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
112
and
the
examiner
in
response
to
this
withdrew
his
objections
under
section
11,
so
we
have
also
collected
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
various
citations
to
the
record
which
show
that
these
claims
do
not
add
anything
inventive
or
new
in
stating
their
end
use
limitations.
they
are
in
their
function
in
this
case,
little
different
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
from
an
attempt
to
patent
the
pythagorean
theorem
about
the
relationship…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
there
never
has
been
a
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
could
be
a
combination
patent
on
a
series
of
steps,
processes
putting
together
processes
that
formerly
had
not
been
put
together.
if
you
had
the
proper
kind
of
an
inventive
contribution…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
may
be
that
--
the
decision
in
this
case
is
not
based
on
any
contention
of
combination
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
never
got
there.
it
was
never
even
claimed
as
a
combination
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
process
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
claim
is
on
the
process
set
forth
in
part
one,
the
parts
--
claims
two
through
10
are
all
dependent
on
that.
they
are
not
set
up
as
if
the
overall
claim
is
on
a
combination
of
processes.
they
are
just
variation,
various
application
…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
a
sense,
claim
one
itself
is
a
combination
of
steps.
any
process
is
a
combination
of
steps.
you
can
think
of
it
as
a
combination…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
all
i
was
trying
to
set
the
stage
for
here,
is
that
respondent
has
never
claimed
that
claims
two
through
10
introduce
anything
novel,
any
more
than
it
would
be
novel
to
say
application
of
the
pythagorean
theorem
to
surveying
or
to
architecture
would
somehow
limit
the
claim
or
if
you
limited,
if
you
wanted
to
say
application
of
it
to
surveying
east
of
the
mississippi
river,
they
are
limitations
in
that
sense
but
they
are
not
limitations
that
go
to
the
essence
of
the
claim.
the
essence
of
the
claim
and
what
all
the
litigation
has
been
about
is
contained
in
claim
one
and
the
four
steps
that
are
set
forth
in
claim
one
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
turn
the
court’s
attention
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
old
case
in
this
court
that
is
very
similar
to
that
hypothetical.
eibel
process
company
which
is
cited
in
footnote
7
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief
and
the
court
there
upheld
the
claim
because
they
found
that
the
application
was
an
inventive
one
even
though
it
was
using
the
force
of
gravity
in
a
paper
manufacturing
process
and
i
do
not
think
the
present
case
really
presents
the
question
whether
that
case
was
correctly
decided.
obviously…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
and
every
process
claim
is
a
claim
about
a
series
of
steps
to
achieve
a
result.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
there
may
be
product
claims
that
are
quite
valid
that
utilize
the
theorem
but
if
the
claim
is
to
the
theorem
itself,
to
the
process
of
using
the
theorem
or
using
any
mathematical
formula
or
method
of
calculating
a
number,
if
that
is
the
claim,
then
the
fact
that
you
want
to
claim
it
only
in
claim
two
using
it
for
surveying
and
in
claim
three
using
it
for
architecture
and
in
claim
four
using
it
for
some
other
conventional
method
of
use,
i
do
not
present
material
limitations
on
the
claim.
they
do
not
show
any
inventive
use
of
the
claim.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
draftsmanship
of
spelling
out
various
end
uses
and
you
can
spell
out
as
many
as
you
can
think
of
in
order
to
claim
the
mathematical
process
related
to
various
end
uses
so
as
to
get
a
process
patent
on
the
mathematical
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
not.
it
was
not
tied
in
with
any
specifically
designed
apparatus.
the
whole
thrust
of
the
application
was
that
you
use
the
conventional
methods
that
are
now
used
in
setting
the
alarm
limits.
but
by
putting
this
mathematical
formula
into
the
computer,
you
can
calculate
the
numbers
more
easily
and
then
imply
them
in
the
ordinary
way
that
the
numbers
are
applied
in
the
existing
technology.
that
is
the
essence
of
what
the
claim
was
and
if
we
look
at
the
setting
forth
of
the
claim
on
page
63a,
there
are
four
steps
in
claim
one
which
is
the
only
claim
that
is
material
to
the
argument
as
i
see
it.
the
first
is
determining
the
present
value
and
the
description
says
you
do
that
the
way
you
do
it
now.
the
claim
does
not
try
to
fill
in
what
the
values
would
be
of
the
process
variables.
it
depends
on
the
process
that
you
are
operating.
you
just
go
about
it
in
your
regular
way.
two
and
three
which
have
the
formulas
are
the
mathematical
algorithm
as
it
is
defined
in
benson
and
then
number
four
is
adjusting
the
alarm
limit
to
the
number
that
you
calculated
by
means
of
steps
two
and
three.
so
four
was
added
on
and
it
is
described
as
just
doing
what
you
would
ordinarily
do
once
you
have
the
number
and
to
use
a
very
homely
analogy.
it
says,
if
two
and
three
were
a
claim
for
a
process
of
a
new
way
to
put
together
cake
ingredients
and
then
another
step
was
added
after
you
have
put
the
ingredients
together
that
way,
you
put
the
cake
in
the
oven
and
bake
it.
that
would
be
number
four.
it
is
what
you
would
ordinarily
do
with
the
number,
the
process
of
calculation
and
what
is
being
done
now
with
the
numbers
is
they
are
calculated
in
the
way
that
they
have
been
calculated
right
along.
there
is
no
element
of
novelty
in
number
four.
but
the
question
to
use
the
cake
analogy
is
whether
if
the
new
method
of
putting
together
the
ingredients
was
not
a
patentable
process,
the
fact
that
you
added
a
fourth
step
saying
and
then
after
you
have
put
them
together,
you
put
the
cake
in
the
oven
and
bake
it,
would
transform
that
into
something
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
limitations
of
the
benson
decision.
that
is
really
the
way
the
question
was
put
in
the
board
of
appeals
and
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
adjudicating
the
case
and
the
decision
in
the
board
of
appeals
and
by
the
examiner
noted,
i
am
lumping
these
two
together
for
brevity,
that
once
the
number
was
calculated,
no
unexpected
results
were
achieved
by
simply
using
the
number
in
the
way
you
would
ordinarily
use
the
number
and
for
that
reason
granting
the
patent
would
in
practical
effect
be
a
patent
on
the
formula
or
the
mathematics
itself.
that
was
the
holding
because
as
the
board
of
appeals
said,
the
respondent
proposes
to
use
just
the
conventional
automatic
alarm
adjusting
equipment
to
implement
the
invention
in
the
ordinary
way
so
that
the
only
element
of
novelty
is
the
way
of
calculating
the
numbers
according
to
these
formulas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
excuse
me,
if
he
sought
a
patent
on…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
it
is
tied
in
to
an
apparatus
which
is
itself
an
inventive
contribution,
an
element
of
novelty
then
the
process
can
be
claimed.
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
telephone
&
telegraph
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
if
that
was….
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
not
be
under
101.
but
there
your
claim
would
be
not
on
a
method
of
calculating
a
number,
not
on
a
mathematical
formula.
but
it
would
be
a
claim
on
a
process
for
achieving
a
result
in
apparatus.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
of
customs
patent
appeals
concluded
that
present
claims
do
not
preempt
the
formula
or
algorithm
contained
there
in.
i
think
that
is
exactly
right.
i
think
that
that
is
the
basis
of
their
distinction
of
events
and
say
because
this
fourth
step
was
added
adjusting
the
alarm
limit
to
update
the
alarm
limit
value
it
ties
the
preemption
of
the
formula
into
a
particular
use
in
the
either
cracking
process.
particular
manufacturing
process
and,
therefore
because
solution
of
the
algorithm
itself
would
not
infringe
the
patent,
the
court
distinguished
this
court’s
decision
in
benson
and
that
is
the
essence
of
what
is
involved
here.
it
is
the
way
the
question
was
put
in
both
courts
below.
as
a
matter
a
fact
it
was
all
put
in
the
context
of
a
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
argument
about
how
to
construe
the
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
say
that
it
is
legal
error
that
the
board
of
appeals
resolved
the
question
correctly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
it
may
not
be
any
other
use
for
it
at
the
present
time
that
we
know
of,
but
somebody
could
solve
the
algorithm
without
infringing
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
the
issue
whether
if
in
benson
had
added
to
his
claim
that
it
would
then
be
used
in
conventional
telephone
switch
board
devices.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
would
make
benson
a
valid
patent
claim
and
in
other
words
if
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
correct
here
then
this
court’s
decision
in
benson
is
really
reduced
to
just
a
drafting
obstacle
and
the
drafting
of
patent
claims.
if
the
claims
are
drafted
so
that
one
or
more
end
uses
are
tacked
on
and
you
can
tack
on
a
list
of
them
in
separate
claims
as
long
you
can
anticipate.
then
you
could
get
exactly
the
patent
that
this
court
denied
in
benson.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
was
a
process
application.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
using
this
algorithm.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
can
focus
exactly
the
way
the
controversy
was
put
below
on
page
12a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
the
controversy
concerned
this
quotation
in
the
middle
of
page
12a
which
was
from
a
prior
opinion
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
applying
this
court’s
decision
in
benson.
that
was
the
christensen
case
in
which
the
court
struck
down
a
patent
claim
on
a
method
of
determining
mathematically
the
porosity
of
subsurface
formations
under
the
ground
without
having
to
dig
in
to
them.
as
we
happen
to
be
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
appeals
now
and
looking
at
this
quotation
from
the
christensen
case
and
they
focused
on
the
formulation,
the
words,
the
point
of
novelty,
as
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
had
said
it
is
a
method
claim
which
the
point
of
novelty
is
a
mathematical
equation
to
be
solved
as
the
final
step
of
the
method,
a
statutory
method
and
the
holding
was
no,
under
benson
it
cannot
be,
but
the
contention
was
then
made
that
point
of
novelty
is
not
the
controlling
language
there.
the
controlling
language
is
the
final
step
and
it
is
only
if
the
mathematics
is
the
final
step
as
well
as
the
point
of
novelty.
that
benson
would
be
controlling.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
agreed
with
that
so
that
by
adding
a
final
step
to
any
of
these
claims
benson
in
effect
becomes
a
dead
letter
and
in
a
concurring
opinion
which
i
had
hope
to
be
able
to
read
excerpts
from,
but
i
do
not
have
time.
concurring
opinion
in
christensen
judge
rich
very
candidly
said
that
he
really
as
he
said.
he
did
not
understand
the
basis
of
the
holding
in
benson.
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
of
these
processes
were
equally
useful
and
that
they
really
should
confine
benson
just
to
the
situation
where
the
mathematical
step
would
itself
be
an
infringement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
apparently
his
colleagues
feel
the
same
way
and
they
have
construed
benson
as
i
say
they
are
reducing
benson
to
be
nothing
but
a
drafting
obstacle.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
significance
of
it
does
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
significance
of
it
as
we
see
it
is
that
it
applies
the
funk
bros
test
which
had
been
applied
therefore
only
to
product
claims
about
the
test
of
invention
under
section
101
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
holding
and
funk
bros.
the
mixture
of
bacteria
was
a
composition
of
matter
in
a
colloquial
sense,
but
it
was
not
an
invention
of
a
composition
of
matter
within
the
meaning
of
section
101
because
the
only
element
of
novelty
was
the
law
of
nature
that
was...
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
a
natural
phenomenon
if
they
would
not
inhibit
each
other
and
benson
said
that
the
same
rule
applies
to
process
claims
and
it
applies
to
mathematical
formulae
and
if
that
is
the
only
the
novelty
the
mathematical
formula
you
cannot
preempt
this
basic
currency
of
exchange
of
scientific
and
technical
knowledge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
way
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
is
now
construed
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
what
gottschalk
said,
i
mean
it
happened
that
there
was
no
end
use
at
all
specified
for
it,
but
you
can
achieve
the
same
result
by
specifying
every
end
use
that
you
could
now
think
of
as
a
conceivable
end
use
and
if
that
is
all
benson
means,
it
means
nothing.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
limited
time,
i
have
remaining,
i
have
to
take
issue
with
respondent’s
characterization
of
the
funk
case
and
with
his
analogy
to
the
putter
in
the
laboratory.
the
putter
in
the
laboratory
who
comes
up
with
a
new
apparatus
although
he
did
not
know
the
phenomenon
of
nature
he
was
applying
gets
a
patent
only
on
that
apparatus.
someone
applying
for
a
process
patent
on
the
phenomenon
of
nature
as
applied
to
this
end
use
preempts
all
use
of
that
phenomenon
of
nature
regardless
of
what
other
apparatus
someone
might
design
for
this
end
use.
it
is
a
much
broader
preemption
of
the
phenomenon
of
nature
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
limited
only
by
an
end
use
and
end
uses
can
be
listed
along.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
if
he
had
listed
it
to
make
bathtubs,
then
it
would
have
precluded
it
to
make
bathtubs
also.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
drafting
the
claim.
the
point
of
novelty
is
in
the
algorithm.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
did
not
make
it
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
he
can
get
it
for
whatever
end
use
if
he
specifies,
if
the
only
thing
new
is
the
algorithm
which
is
comparable
to
a
phenomenon
of
nature.
now,
the
funk
case,
i
have
to
emphasize
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
standard
of
invention
under
section
101
must
be
applied
to
the
application
of
the
phenomenon
of
nature.
this
is
not
a
novel
question
before
this
court.
this
is
the
significance
of
the
holding
in
funk.
the
claim
in
funk
was
not
on
the
discovery
that
these
bacteria
did
not
inhibit
one
another.
the
claim
in
funk
was
on
the
product
of
a
mixed
inoculant
that
was
commercially
valuable
that
was
being
marketed
to
farmers
for
use
on
their
leguminous
plants
in
which
these
bacteria
were
intermixed
and
that
the
court
said
was
the
application
of
the
phenomenon
of
nature.
it
used
the
very
word
'application'.
then
it
said,
however
ingenious
the
discovery
of
the
underlying
natural
principle
may
have
been
in
this
case,
the
application
of
it
is
hardly
more
than
an
advance
in
the
packaging
of
the
inoculants.
the
application
did
not
meet
the
standard
of
invention
and
the
very
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
says,
we
conclude
that
the
product
claims
do
not
disclose
an
invention
or
discovery
within
the
meaning
of
the
patent
statutes
and
at
that
time,
section
103
was
not
in
the
patent
statutes.
that
was
merely
common
law
about
obviousness.
what
was
in
the
patent
statutes
was
that
it
must
be
an
invention
or
discovery
of
a
new
and
useful
product
and
it
was
not
because
there
was
no
novelty
in
the
application
of
the
phenomenon
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
say
there
has
to
be
novelty
in
the
end
use.
it
either
has
to
be
tied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
use
itself
must
produce
an
unexpected
result.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
patentable
process
patent
but
tied
into
that
end
use
or
that
apparatus,
that
is
what
we
understand
benson
and
funk
to
mean
and
benson
saying
that
funk
applies
to
process
patents.
that
is
our
position
and
otherwise,
you
do
get
all
computer
programming
subject
to
patentability
with
all
the
difficulties
that
are
pointed
out
in
an
amicus
brief
which
i
have
not
had
time
to
refer
to
but
which
i
do
call
the
court’s
attention
to
filed
on
behalf
of
the
computer
and
business
manufacturers
association
which
points
out
both
international
problems
and
problems
of
trying
to
set
up
a
search
system
for
this.
these
are
matters
that
do
require
legislative
attention.
the
present
patent
laws
are
not
designed
for
this.
