justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
not
a
subquestion
there
mr.
abercrombie
even
assuming
that
both
of
the
last
two
–
both
of
your
questions
are
answered
by
the
board
as
to
whether
the
principle
of
republic
aviation
should
be
applied
the
same
way
to
strictly
political
literature
as
to
organizational
literature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
--
and
that
was
an
upholding
by
this
court
of
the
board’s
finding
that
this
particular
type
of
rule
was
reasonable
with
respect
to
organizational
material?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
my
question
to
you
is
even
though
one
were
to
conclude
that
the
sort
of
literature
that
were
to
be
--
that
was
sought
to
be
distributed
here
was
covered
under
section
7
and
even
though
the
board
were
permitted
to
conclude
under
the
act
that
some
distribution
were
permissible
on
the
employer’s
property,
would
it
necessarily
be
entitled
to
simply
use
the
republic
aviation
formula
without
any
reweighing
of
factors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nor
is
that
the
employer
is
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
nor
is
the
employer
is
the
congress
of
the
united
states
so
is
to
be
forbidden
from
abridging
freedom
of
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
not
the
reason
for
you
reply
to
justice
white
since
section
7,
if
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
political
activity
might
protect
the
employee
against
the
discharge
and
since
you
say
section
7
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it
then
so
far
as
the
section
7
effect
is
concerned,
the
employer
is
free
to
deal
with
the
employees
he
chooses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
your
position
really
is
your
preference
would
be
to
have
no
solicitation,
but
you
know
republic
aviation
is
on
the
books
so
you
will
allow
solicitation
to
the
extent
the
law
requires
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
phrase
the
issue
that
way
mr.
allen,
where
the
employer
must
show
some
special,
is
that
on
the
base
of
republic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
not
concede
that
the
board
might
rationally
adopt
a
different
rule
for
the
peripheral
matter
included
under
section
7
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
than
it
did
for
organizational
materials
such
as
was
involved
in
republic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
of
my
difficulties
here
was
that
republic
aviation
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
sets
out
at
a
great
length
the
board’s
reasoning
for
concluding
it
organizational
material
was
the
kind
of
distribution
to
which
the
employer’s
property
rights
had
to
yield
and
all
i
see
in
this
--
the
board’s
stream
of
this
case
is
that
they
rather
summarily
affirm
the
findings
of
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
particular
board
decision
that
says
republic
aviation
should
be
carried
over
to
all
or
rather
mutual
aid
or
protection
and
why
it
should
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
said
the
case
is
recognized
mr.
allen,
what
cases
are
you
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
court
of
appeals
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
proceeded.
you
proceeded
under
the
basis
that
this
particular
distribution
was
reasonably
related
to
these
particular
employees
and
their
jobs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
allen,
all
i
find
that
the
board
has
said
in
these
cases
on
24
(a)
and
25
(a)
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
are
four
paragraphs
simply
a
boiler
plate
affirmance
of
the
findings
the
administrative
law
judge.
i
would
be
more
persuaded
by
your
argument
if
i
could
find
somewhere
where
the
board
had
reason
to
think
through
and
said
this
outer
bounded
section
7
does
include
this
kind
of
action,
but
certainly
the
board’s
order
in
this
case
does
not
do
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
in
effect
that
the
discretion
ultimately
is
not
necessarily
lodged
in
the
board,
but
in
the
administrative
law
judge?
