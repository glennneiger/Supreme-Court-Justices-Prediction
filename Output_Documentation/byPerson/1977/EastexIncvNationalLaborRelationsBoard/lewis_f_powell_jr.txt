justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
labor
law
case.
the
petitioner
is
a
corporate
employer
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
a
group
of
petitioner's
employees
sought
permission
to
distribute
a
union
newsletter
in
nonworking
areas
of
petitioner's
property
during
nonworking
time.
the
part
of
the
newsletter
discussed
union
affairs
and
part
of
it
discussed
minimum
wage
and
right
to
work
legislation.
petitioner
refused
permission.
the
employees
then
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
alleged
that
the
refusal
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
by
interfering
with
their
right
under
section
7
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
board
held
that
petitioner
had
violated
the
act
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
now
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
the
entire
newsletter
concerned
matters
that
could
improve
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
otherwise
improve
the
employees
lot
as
employers.
we
therefore,
think
that
the
distribution
of
the
newsletter
was
within
the
protection
of
the
mutual
aid
or
protection
clause
of
section
7.
in
this
case,
neither
petitioner's
right
to
maintain
discipline
and
production
in
its
plant
nor
its
property
rights
would
be
imped
materially
by
allowing
the
newsletter
to
be
distributed
in
nonworking
areas
during
nonworking
time.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
the
employees
were
entitled
to
do
so.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
