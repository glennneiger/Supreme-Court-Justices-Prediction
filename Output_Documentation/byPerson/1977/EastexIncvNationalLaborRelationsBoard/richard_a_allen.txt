mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
agree
with
that
proposition,
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
extent
that
the
union
is
simply
sticking
in
incidental
section
7
material
in
literature
that
is
primarily
a
vehicle
for
unrelated
political
propaganda.
the
board,
i
think
its
position
is
fairly
clear
would
not
contend
that
that
was
protected
activity.
the
board’s
position
is
the
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
limited
to
a
situation
where
at
least
a
substantial
portion
of
the
literature
is
protected
by
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
hard
to
speculate
without
knowing
all
of
the
circumstances
of
what
the
literature
relates
to
and
i
would
not
want
to
say
what
the
board
would
decide.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
if
in
for
example
a
union
newspaper,
one
column
out
of
a
five
page
newspaper
said
vote
for
joe
smith,
i
do
not
think
if
the
rest
of
the
newspaper
was
substantially
devoted
to
relevant
section
7
materials
that
were
not
suggesting
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
but
the
board’s
position
in
this
case
is
designed
to
avoid
a
word
count.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
employer
is
charged
with
having
restrained
his
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights,
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
essentially
the
analysis
presents
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
activity
of
the
employees
was
an
activity
that
comes
within
the
scope
of
section
7.
if
not,
then
the
case
is
over.
the
employer
has
not
committed
any
unfair
labor
practice
by
restraining
the
activity.
if
however,
the
activity
is
within
the
scope
of
section
7,
a
second
issue
is
presented,
namely
whether
the
employer
has
shown
some
special
management
or
property
interest
that
would
justify
some
restrictions
by
him
on
the
manner
in
which
the
section
7
rights
are
exercised.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
on
the
basis
of
republic
aviation
in
its
progeny
including
nlrb
vs.
magnavox
most
recently.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
board
has
not
made
any
such
distinctions.
we
contend
that
the
board
has
reasonably
not
made
any
distinctions,
whether
it
could
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
although
i
can
think
of
many
difficulties
between
trying
to
decide
–
trying
to
make
categories
among
section
7
rights
as
to
which
are
more
important
and
which
are
less
important
in
the
balance
that
republic
aviation
requires.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
the
board’s
position
we
contend
that
legally
correct
position
that
the
distribution
that
the
news
bulletin
here
came
within
the
scope
of
section
7,
that
it
related
to
matter
involving
–
it
was
a
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection
that
is
protected
by
section
7
and
the
board
has
adopted
in
cases
involving
employer
restraint
on
section
7
activities,
the
general
rule
of
republic
aviation
that
unless
the
employer
has
come
up
with
some
special
interest
in
production
or
discipline,
he
may
not
lawfully
prohibit
the
distribution
by
employees
of
section
7
material
on
nonworking
time
and
in
nonworking
areas.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
cannot
think
of
any
board
decision
specifically
making
that
point
although
i
would
submit
that
nlrb
vs.
magnavox
does
so
implicitly
to
the
extent
that,
excuse
me
a
second,
according
to
petitioner’s
definition,
that
would
be
an
organizational
activity,
but
i
am
sorry,
i
cannot
think
of
one
offhand
although
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
each
case
depends
on
its
facts.
this
is
the
first
case
that
involves
minimum
texas
right
to
work
law.
it
is
different
than
–
it
is
different,
but
it
is
fully
within
the
general
and
well
established
principles
that
the
court
and
the
board
have
articulated
under
section
7.
the
principle
issue
in
this
case
is
the
first
issue
whether
the
activity
comes
within
the
scope
of
section
7.
that
is
an
issue
that
goes
beyond
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
because
if
as
petitioner
quite
clearly
contends,
section
7
does
not
cover
or
bear
on
the
distribution
of
the
news
bulletin
because
of
its
content,
then
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
prohibit
an
employer
from
restraining
employees
by
any
means
including
discharge
for
distributing
the
bulletin
either
on
or
off
the
premises.
mr.
abercrombie
has
made
that
quite
explicit
today
and
in
connection
with
mr.
chief
justice’s
remarks,
it
is
clear
mr.
chief
justice
that
section
7
does
apply
to
activity
–
to
distribution
of
material
off
the
premises
on
the
sidewalk.
if
for
instance
this
material
was
being
distributed
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
employer
discharged
the
employee
for
doing
that,
then
we
would
contend
that
the
employer
has
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
he
has
interfered
with
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights
of
his
employees.
now,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
distribution
of
the
news
bulletin
is
not
covered
by
section
7
at
all
because
in
its
view,
section
7
only
applies
to
at
least
as
it
is
stated
in
its
brief
and
i
quote
from
page
13
of
its
brief,
“activities
which
are
related
to
a
specific
dispute
with
the
employer
over
an
issue
which
the
employer
has
the
right
or
power
to
control.”
today,
in
oral
argument,
mr.
abercrombie
advanced
additional
reasons
for
its
contention
that
the
distribution
of
the
news
bulletin
was
not
covered
by
section
7
and
namely
that
it
involved
what
he
termed
to
be
political
matters
and
also
because
it
allegedly
did
not
involve
organization.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
term
those
materials,
mr.
chief
justice
as
materials
that
are
within
the
scope
of
the
mutual
aid
or
protection
clause
of
section
7.
they
are
materials
that
are
directly
related
to
the
very
significant
concerns
of
the
employees
on
this
plant.
they
are
also
materials
that
are
related
to
the
concerns
of
employees
generally
which
we
submit
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
mutual
aid
and
protection
clause
of
section
7
and
we
would
submit
that
also
it
was
in
a
very
real
sense
part
of
the
union’s
organizational
efforts.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
was
affecting
their
jobs?
i
think
the
board
might
have
a
very
reasonable
basis
in
a
case
like
that
for
contending
that
it
was
within
the
scope
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
not
exactly,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
seems
to
me
clearly
under
the
case
that
it
would
protected
by
section
7.
the
case
for
example
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
well
established
in
the
cases
recognized
that
for
instance
refusals
of
employees
of
one
employer
to
cross
the
picket
line
of
employees
of
another
employer
is
protected
by
section
7,
although
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
employees,
refusing
employees
jobs
or
their
relationship
with
their
employer.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
but
the
first
question
we
have
to
isolate
is
whether
or
not
the
activity
is
within
the
scope
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
established
rules
that
the
distribution
of
that
literature
by
employees
in
nonworking
areas
on
nonworking
time
was
an
activity
that
was
protected
by
section
7
unless
the
employer
came
up
with
some
kind
of
reason
as
to
why
he
had
an
interest
of
any
kind
in
prohibiting
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
cases
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
but
the
cases
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
are
many
court
of
appeals
cases
and
supreme
court
cases
as
well
that
recognize
that
section
7
is
not
limited
to
matters
which
affect
the
employee’s
relationship
with
their
employer
or
and
that
involve
matters
over
which
the
employer
has
any
right
or
power
to
affect.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
that
standard
and
we
think
that
that
standard
is
well
within
the
standard
boundaries
of
section
7
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
accurately
found
that
the
distribution
of
this
news
bulletin
did
affect
the
employees
themselves
in
their
jobs.
we
think
the
case
is
established
that
that
is
not
a
necessary
requirement.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
that
is
essentially
what
we
have
in
this
case.
though
the
congressman
was
not
really
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
oppose
sales
of
airplanes
to
arab
countries?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
with
respect
to
the
first
part
of
that,
i
cannot
really
see
how
it
would
affect
the
employee’s
interests
as
employees
unless
perhaps
they
were
employees
of
the
aviation
industry.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
a
little
argument
on
behalf
of
the
employees?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
think
there
would
be
a
dispute
among
the
employees
as
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
it
is
not
wide
open.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
is
certainly
not
wide
open
and
we
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not.
the
very
scheme
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
suggest
that
section
7
activities
have
to
relate
somehow
to
the
employee
status
as
employees
under
the
statute,
but
we
suggest
that
petitioner
is
erroneous
in
contending
that
those
matters
have
to
relate
specifically
to
their
disputes
with
the
employer.
we
suggest
that
the
case
was
clearly
established.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
where
is
it
bounded?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
difficult
to
say
and
the
board
has
not
--
it
is
difficult
to
articulate
a
standard
other
than
the
language
of
section
7
itself
to
describe
the
outer
boundaries
of
section
7.
as
i
suggested
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
union
does
not
have
the
unreviewable
discretion.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
if
in
fact
his
opinion
is
unreasonable
i
do
not
think
that
he
is
entitled
to
an
unreasonable
opinion.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
think
the
act
vests
in
a
board,
the
ultimate
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
activity
is
within
the
scope
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
i
think
it
would.
though
i
think
if
the
employee
–
if
the
union
had
one
view
is
–
if
the
union’s
view
was
that
we
think
this
literature
about
environmental
legislation
is
protected
and
the
board
said
no
we
do
not
think
so
and
then
under
the
act
the
board
has
the
ultimate
say.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no,
the
board
has
the
function
not
of
determining
the
merits
of
environmental
legislation,
but
determining
the
scope
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
in
that
connection
mr.
justice
stewart
that
as
this
court
has
recognized
many
times,
the
board’s
determination
or
the
question
of
whether
--
of
the
scope
of
section
7
and
whether
--
and
how
it
applies
to
particular
fact
situations
is
a
question
that
the
board’s
determination
should
we
believe
be
given
a
large
measure
of
latitude
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
field
of
labor
management
relations
obviously
involves
an
infinite
variety
of
situations.
the
board
has
to
deal
with
these
situations
everyday
and
it
has
to
make
distinctions
that
are
sometimes
difficult,
but
they
are
nevertheless
necessary
to
make.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
you
are
referring
to
the
board’s
order
of
adopting
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
mr.
rehnquist
has
to
be
deemed
to
be
incorporated
within
the
board’s
order.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
at
all,
the
administrative
board
has
power
to
review
and
reverse
the
administrative
law
judge.
but
with
respect
to
your
broader
point
that
the
board
has
not
articulated
a
reason,
well,
we
believe
that
the
administrative
law
judge
whose
opinion
was
incorporated
by
the
board,
adopted
by
the
board
made
quite
clear
the
reasons
for
it,
but
in
any
event,
the
board
has
throughout
the
administration
of
section
7
articulated
standards
that
have
quite
clearly
indicated
and
relied
in
this
case
on
former
decisions
that
have
quite
clearly
indicated
that
activity
of
this
kind
is
activity
--
that
it
is
activity
that
can
be
in
some
sense
deemed
to
be
political
is
an
activity
that
is
protected
by
section
7
if
it
is
reasonably
related
to
the
interest
of
the
employees
as
employees
under
the
statute
and
there
is
a
long
and
well
established
history.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
this
case
urged
--
the
paragraph
--
the
bulletin
of
this
case
urged
its
employees
–
urged
the
members
of
the
union
to
vote
for
legislators
who
would
support
a
minimum
wage
legislation.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
your
hypothesis
is
different
because
it
specifically
sets
out
a
list
of
candidates
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
your
hypothesis,
i
think
it
might
well
be
open
to
the
board
to
determine
that
that
kind
of
purely
political
solicitation
in
the
context
of
a
political
campaign
was
and
i
am
saying
i
think
it
might
be
open
or
not,
i
do
not
--
of
course
i
cannot
predict
how
the
board
would
find
it,
but
i
think
it
might
be
open
to
the
board
to
determine
that
that
kind
of
activity
was
sufficiently
removed
from
the
interest
of
the
employees
as
to
not
merit
section
7
protection.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
one
case
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
it
was
a
decision
by
the
board
in
the
ford
motor
company
case,
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
30,
where
the
board
held
that
an
attempt
by
the
union
to
distribute
a
newspaper
which
i
believe
was
a
socialist
worker’s
party
newspaper,
was
not
activity
that
was
protected
by
section
7
because
the
board
said,
it
was
purely
political
propaganda.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right.
but
the
board’s
position
is
not
that
because
it
is
political,
it
is
protected.
that
is
certainly
not
the
board’s
position.
the
board’s
position
is
that
it
is
protected
if
it
reasonably
relates
to
the
interest
of
the
employees.
of
course
it
happens
also
to
be
something
that
can
be
characterized
as
political
advocacy.
the
board
submits
that
that
does
not
remove
it
from
this
protection
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
the
hypothesis
that
the
chief
justice
gave
me
and
i
was
suggesting
that
in
those
circumstances
it
might
be
open
to
the
board
to
determine
that
this
was
not
a
bona
fide
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
might
be
open.
i
do
not
know
how
the
board
would
decide
it.
i
would
not
blush
at
defending
the
board’s
conclusion
that
that
was
protected
by
section
7.
after
all,
the
phrase
concerted
activities
for
mutual
aid
and
protection
is
by
its
very
terms
an
extremely
broad
phrase.
the
history
of
the
act
indicates
that
it
had
a
broad
intent
and
i
think
that
perhaps
judge
learned
hand
in
the
peter
cailler
kohler
case
most
eloquently
explained
the
reason
for
that.
he
explained
that
the
every
notion
of
mutual
aid
and
protection
is
the
notion
that
when
employee
a
assists
employee
b
with
respect
to
employee
b’s
problem,
that
serves
both
of
their
mutual
interests.
the
reason
as
he
stated
was
that,
i
cannot
find
it
directly,
but
essentially
that
when
a’s
turn
comes,
he
knows
that
b
is
going
to
help
him.
that
is
the
very
concept
of
mutual
aid
and
protection.
it
is
a
concept
that
is
consistently
not
been
limited
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
the
battlefield
of
employer/employee
relations.
it
is
a
broader
concept.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
no
i
think
the
board
stands
by
that
decision.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
am
not
sure
that
that
position
would
necessarily
foreclose
the
board
from
determining
that
in
your
hypothetical.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
board
could
reasonably
decide
it
either
way,
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
foreclose
the
board
from
determining
that
a
message
to
union
members
vote
for
abc
friends
of
labor
was
something
that
fell
outside
the
scope
of
section
7
i
think.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
you
raise
a
very
good
point.
the
term
political
is
a
term
that
is
hard
to
define.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct.
the
relevant
test
of
section
7
is
to
the
extent
we
can
paraphrase
the
language
of
section
7
matters
that
affect
the
interests
of
employees
as
employees
and
not
as
for
example
football
fans
or
connoisseurs
of
fine
wine,
but
as
employees,
that
is
the
purpose
of
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
the
basis
that,
well,
the
basis
for
that
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
starting
with
public
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
reason
for
the
presumption
is
that
when
employees
are
engaged
in
section
7
activity
on
the
employers
plant,
particularly
activity
being
the
distribution
of
literature,
on
the
employer’s
plant
where
they
have
a
legitimate
right
to
be
on
nonworking
time
and
in
nonworking
areas
for
the
employer
to
flatly
prohibit
that
is
an
activity
that
invades
their
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
question
might
be
best
answered
by
converse
question
if
the
activity
is
something
that
congress
designed
intended
to
protect
when
it
passed
section
7,
what
is
the
reason
for
allowing
the
employer
to
prohibit
that
activity
when
the
employers
are
already
on
this
plant
and
when
they
are
not
on
working
time
and
not
invading
any
working
areas?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but
the
premise
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
that
his
naked
property
rights
have
to
yield
to
rights
of
employees
under
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
without
limit.
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
would
be
a
proper
accommodation.
the
board
has
determined
that
in
cases
where
all
the
employer
alleges
which
is
this
case
right
here
is
a
naked
property
right,
that
accommodation,
the
proper
resolution
of
that
accommodation
is
to
allow
the
employees
to
engage
in
their
section
7
activities.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
nothing
to
do
with
the
job.
the
literature
in
this
case…
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
job
directly
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
so
we
would
cite
you
the
general
electric
case
for
example
where
the
activity
there
was
activity
by
employees
in
the
parking
lot
collecting,
soliciting
support
for
and
i
believe
funds
for
support
of
the
great
american
farm
grape
workers
and
i
think
the
board
expounded
it
is
rational
in
that
case.
i
do
not
want
to
take
the
court
time,
but
i
would
say
to
you
that
case
and
also
the
kaiser
case
where
the
activity
being
engaged
in
was
writing
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
it
did.
411
f2
750
enforced
it.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
i
think
he
could
mr.
justice
marshall
if
the
activity
was
simply
a
disparagement
of
your
employers
product,
this
court
is
held
a
local
1229
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
in
the
sense
your
hypothetical
seems
to
me
the
disparaged
product
but
saying
somebody
else
has
got
a
better
one.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
better
working
contract
so
by
their
products?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
am
afraid
you
have,
i
am
not
terribly
familiar
with
the
rules
in
their
8
b)
(4),
but
i
think
that…
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
am
not
familiar
with
those
rules
but
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
board
frequently
faces
those
smoky
lines
your
honor
and
has
to
do
the
best
they
can.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
only
one
that
i
know
off
is
one
alleged
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
their
brief,
the
federal
elections
campaign
act
and
i
do
not
think
that
would
apply
to
distributions
in
his
plant.
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
none.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
be
a
factor
your
honor.
it
might
well
be
a
factor
if
the
employer
advanced
such
reasons.
the
board
has
recognized
that
if
he
can
show
that
that
is
going
to
disrupt
his
working
environment
that
there
can
be
accommodation
of
the
rights,
but
the
petitioner
here
made
no
such
claim.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
cannot
see
why
the
panama
canal
treaty
would
be
related
to
the
interest
of
employees.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes,
i
believe
he
could.
