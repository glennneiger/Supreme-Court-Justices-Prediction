put
that
way,
you
are
not
necessarily
arguing
that
it
is
unprotected.
you
are
just
saying
you
cannot
do
it
on
the
employer’s
premises
or
are
you
arguing
both
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
is
protected,
you
cannot
do
it
on
the
employer’s
premises
and
it
is
not
protected
in
the
first
place,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
--
i
suppose
you
can
say
a
lot
of
things
are
protected,
but
you
just
cannot
do
them
some
places.
it
is
like
freedom
of
speech.
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
it
sometimes.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
not
a
bad
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
might
be
the
first
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
seem
to
agree
then
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
connection
with
the
employee’s
job
for
this
particular
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
need
not
have
any
connection?
what
about
circulars
urging
the
employees
to
join
other
employees
in
a
boycott
of
a
certain
supermarket
chain?
it
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
the
employers,
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
though
it
has
no
connection
with
the
job
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
then
on
the
employer’s
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
will
ask
you
the
next
question,
how
about
that
boycott
literature
distributed
on
the
employer’s
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
it
has
to
do
is
that
you
can
