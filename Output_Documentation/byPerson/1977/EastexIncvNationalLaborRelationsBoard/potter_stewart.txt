what
is
the
boundary
that
as
my
brother
marshall
asked,
who
determines
it?
is
the
union
leadership,
does
it
have
unreviewable
discretion
to
decide
in
this
gray
area
what
is
for
the
mutual
protection
benefit
of
employees
such
as
let
us
take
environmental
legislation.
now,
one
can
argue
on
either
side
whether
that
is
good
or
bad
for
employees
of
a
particular
plant
or
employees
generally
or
the
economy
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
say
this
particular
union,
head
of
the
local
is
a
very
strong
environmentalist
and
he
is
convinced
that
proposed
environmental
legislation
in
the
state
of
texas
is
going
to
be
very
good
for
the
employees
of
this
plant
as
well
as
employees
generally,
can
he
have
literature
distributed
along
those
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
and
so
would
an
opposite
opinion
be
perfectly
reasonable?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
it
depend
upon
whether
it
is
reasonable?
justice
potter
stewart
why
because
the
board
has
the
opposite
view
about
the
environmental
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
question
of
course.
