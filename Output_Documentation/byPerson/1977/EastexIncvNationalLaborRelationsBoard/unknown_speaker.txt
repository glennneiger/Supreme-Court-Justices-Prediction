suppose
a
--
suppose
an
employee
of
a
particular
company
on
his
off
time
helps
–
helps
picket
another
employer
and
he
gets
fired
for
it?
unknown
speaker
it
has
not
anything
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
the
fired
employee
and
his
employer?
unknown
speaker
so
what
about
the
--
what
if
the
–
what
if
the
union
member
and
employee
in
his
off
hours
time
or
in
nonworking
time
distributes
information
about
the
union’s
own
welfare
plan
or
medical
plan
or
own
legal
services
plan.
it
has
not
anything
to
do
with
the
employer
or
the
relationships
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
but
they
distributed
on
the
property
and
the
employer
does
not
like
it?
unknown
speaker
although,
i
suppose
if
he
fired
some
employee
for
participating
in
some
union
program
that
he
just
did
not
like,
it
might
be
a
completely
bona
fide
union
program
and
the
employer
just
did
not
like
it
and
he
fired
the
employee
for
it,
although
the
program
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
employer’s
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
suppose
--
you
are
not
arguing
it
in
this
case,
but
i
would
suppose
you
could
easily
think
up
cases
where
it
is
a
protected
activity
generally,
but
you
just
cannot
do
it
on
the
employer’s
premises?
unknown
speaker
well
you
would
not
suggest
--
you
would
not
suggest
the
employer
could
fire
the
union
people
for
distributing
right
to
work
literature
if
they
were
not
distributing
it
on
the
employer’s
property
and
you
would
not
say
that
–
and
would
you
not
say
it
would
violate
section
7
to
do
that?
the
union
is
banding
together
and
they
all
want
to
oppose
right
to
work
laws
and
they
pass
out
literature
out
on
the
public
street
and
the
employer
says,
i
just
do
not
like
you
fellows
getting
into
this
business,
i
am
going
to
fire
you.
now,
is
that
an
unfair
legal
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
lose
that
argument
and
still
win
the
one
you
are
making
today.
unknown
speaker
the
collective
bargaining
contract
would
probably
protect
him,
that
is
the
point,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
would
probably
violate
the
ordinary
mind
run
collective
bargaining
contract
if
he
discharged
an
employee
if
he
is
a
republican,
that
is
not
the
cause?
unknown
speaker
your
point
i
gather
is
that
it
is
the
board’s
position
that
whether
or
not
literature
is
or
is
not
political
is
not
a
relevant
test
under
section
7?
that
it
may
be
political
and
protected
under
section
7?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
nonpolitical
and
unprotected
under
section
7?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
a
relevant
test
for
section
7
in
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
for
the
presumption
that
is
applied?
it
is
presumptively
invalid
if
you
bar,
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
unknown
speaker
i
do
want
to
know,
what
is
the
reason
for
the
presumption?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
that
the
employee
–
you
are
saying
that
this
presumption
applies
even
to
distributions
that
have
very
little
to
do
with
anything
with
the
employer’s
business
and
his
relationship
with
the
union?
that
is
your
position
on
the
board’s
position
and
i
am
not
able
to
understand
the
basis
for
the
presumption
where
the
distribution
does
affect
the
relationship
between
the
employer
whose
property
is
being
used
for
the
distribution
and
his
employee,
but
what
is
the
basis
for
a
presumption,
that
reason
for
him
closing
on
the
employer
is
not
there?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
is
his
property
right,
i
guess.
he
does
not
like
what
they
are
distributing
on
his
property
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
relationship
for
the
union
--
unknown
speaker
not
without
limit?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
again
the
question.
i
think
was
included
in
what
brother
rehnquist
asked
you.
do
you
know
what
case
it
is,
if
there
is
any,
where
the
board
itself
or
a
hearing
examiner
or
an
administrative
law
judge
has
addressed
the
question
of
why
a
protected
literature
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
job
must
be
allowed
to
be
distributed
on
an
employer’s
property?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
does
not
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
job?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
grape
workers
never
went
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
does
the
statute
impose
any
limit
on
the
employer,
say
you
have
union
political
propaganda
that
is
distributed,
is
there
any
statutory
restriction
on
the
employers
right
to
distribute
literature
expressing
a
countervailing
political
point
of
view?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
by
the
way,
i
think
some
day
you
might
look
at
the
enforcement
procurian
in
the
general
electric
case?
