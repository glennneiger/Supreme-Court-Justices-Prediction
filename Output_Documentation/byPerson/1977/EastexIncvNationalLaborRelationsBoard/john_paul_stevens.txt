paul
stevens
mr.
abercrombie,
following
up
on
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
i
do
not
understand
you
to
contend
that
the
right
to
distribute
literature
is
limited
to
organizational
literature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
concede,
do
you
not,
that
if
this
pamphlet
had
included
nothing,
but
items
one
and
4,
it
would
have
been
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
act
4
is
a
general
exhortation
in
favor
of
the
unions,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
act
4
is
just
sort
of
a
general
exhortation
that
unions
are
fined
organizations,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
sort
of
general
exhortation
you
say
is
protected,
but
why
are
not
2
and
3
in
the
same
general
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abercrombie,
before
you
sit
down,
one
thing
puzzles
me
about
this
case.
two
parts
of
the
circular,
i
think
you
have
conceded
can
be
distributed
on
the
employer’s
premises.
what
is
the
significance
of
the
employer’s
right
to
say
the
other
two
parts
must
also
be
protected?
say
instead
of
political
propaganda,
they
would
simply
had
comic
strips
or
a
fictional
story
or
something
like
that,
would
that
justify
including
the
entire
pamphlet
and
why
is
the
employer
so
interested
and
want
some
right
to
come
on
the
property
has
been
established?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
keep
the
people
off
who
want
to
distribute
parts
1
and
4.
you
are
objecting
to
something
else
being
in
the
pamphlet
and
there
is
an
equal
invasion
of
your
property
right
it
seems
to
me
whether
the
pamphlet
has
got
two
pages
or
four
pages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
having
conceded
that
they
can
come
on
and
distribute
1
and
4,
what
is
you
serious
objection
to
letting
them
put
pages
2
and
3?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
it
was
comic
strips?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
really,
i
do
not
know
why
it
is,
if
you
will
let
it
be
distributed
on
the
property
what
you
have
to,
but
if
you
do
not
like
what
else
they
mix
with
it,
you
are
going
to
keep
it
off?
