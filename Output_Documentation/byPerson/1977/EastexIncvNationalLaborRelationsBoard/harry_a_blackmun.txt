can
it
be
anything
more
political
than
supporting
a
candidate
for
office
or
opposing
another
candidate?
that
is
the
essence
of
politics
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
a
general
election,
let
us
assume
that
all
that
was
distributed
was
a
list
of
the
candidates
with
some
biographical
data
saying
these
are
friends
of
labor?
justice

might
be
open?
