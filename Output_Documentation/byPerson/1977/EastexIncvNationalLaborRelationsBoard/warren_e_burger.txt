chief

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
eastex
against
the
labor
board.
mr.
abercrombie,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
not
challenge
the
right
to
circularize
this
outside
the
company
gates
on
the
public
sidewalk,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
public
sidewalk?
i
am
speaking
now
of
employees
leaving
work
to
going
home
at
night,
after
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
section
7
have
anything
to
do
with
it
if
it
is
out
in
a
public
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
why
i
asked
you
whether
section
7
has
anything
to
do
with
what
they
do
out
on
the
public
highway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
could
hand
the
leaflets
out
on
the
sidewalk
as
the
employees
came
out
of
the
plant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
not
on
the
employer’s
time
and
his
premises,
section
7
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
i
thought
you
agreed
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
off,
off,
on
the
employee's
own
time
out
in
the
public
place,
section
7
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
might
have
a
strike
on
his
hands
in
addition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
otherwise,
if
that
were
not
so,
they
could
have
one
union
message
and
six
political
messages,
is
that
not
so,
mr.
abercrombie?
if
that
were
not
so,
they
could
have
one
union
message
and
six
political
messages
and
that
would
carry
it
if
you
were
not
correct
on
that
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you
are
on
that,
before
you
get
started,
do
you
disagree
with
that
last
proposition
that
the
union
cannot
carry
six
political
messages
and
one
union
message
in
one
pamphlet
and
be
protected
by
section
7?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
let
us
reverse
it.
i
suppose
it
is
three
quarters
union
message
and
just
25%
campaigning
for
some
candidate,
you
think
that
is
protected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
say
it
is
supporting
a
candidate
for
running
for
public
office
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
get
into
a
word
count?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
term
those
materials,
mr.
allen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
were
advocating
high
tariffs
on
all
products
of
japan
on
the
grounds
that
japanese
were
guilty
of
unfair
competition,
lower
labor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
literature
which
urges
them
to
vote
against
a
given
congressman
or
senator
on
the
grounds
that
he
favors
right
to
work
laws?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
come
back
to
the
last
answer
you
gave
me
and
see
if
you
still
want
to
stand
on
it.
my
hypothesis
was
that
the
literature
distributed
was
simply
a
lists
of
candidates
they
should
vote
against
because
these
candidates
were
against
the
right
to
work
law
and
you
said
that
was
all
right,
that
is
protected.
now,
you
still
want
to
stand
on
that?
you
said
that
is
this
case,
it
is
not
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
that
is
not
my
hypothesis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
else?
no
union
message
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
your
quotation
of
the
foreign
case
is
accurate
and
i
assume
it
is
on
page
30,
i
do
not
think
you
will
have
to
either
defend
the
board
or
blush
at
defending
them.
my
hypothetical
was
drawn
from
that
precise
case
in
the
board
and
it
concluded
saying
this
is
wholly
political
propaganda
which
does
not
relate
to
the
employee’s
problems
and
concerns
all
employees.
do
you
think
the
board
might
change
its
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
well
not
in
particular
my
hypothetical,
the
board’s
own
decision
in
the
ford
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
would
not
have
to
worry
about
defending
them
because
unless
they
change
their
position?
it
is
either
this
is
political
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
--
you
mentioned
only
the
naked
property
right,
i
think
you
put
it
that
way,
what
about
the
interest
of
the
employer
not
having
his
employees
get
into
a
big
argument,
fist
fights
or
less
if
they
are
arguing
over
the
panama
canal
or
the
right
to
work,
is
not
that
factor
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
had
people
advocating
the
panama
canal
treaty
on
the
one
hand
opposing
on
the
other,
a
subject
that
was
as
heated
as
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
he
could
forbid
it,
could
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
ford
motor
case.
mr.
abercrombie?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
eastex
incorporate
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
