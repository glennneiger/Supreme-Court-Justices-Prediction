mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
out
of
refusal
of
eastex
to
allow
distribution
of
a
union
circular
on
its
plant
premises.
the
circular
is
found
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
appendix.
the
refusal
was
because
sections
2
and
3
of
the
circular
were
considered
to
have
no
relevance
to
any
matter
concerning
petitioner's
employees
as
employees
and
was
political
in
nature.
petitioner
had
no
objection
to
sections
1
and
4
of
the
circular.
section
2
of
the
circular
consisted
of
a
polemic
against
inclusion
by
a
texas
constitutional
convention
of
a
right
to
work
provision
in
a
proposed
revised
constitution.
section
3
contained
criticisms
of
then
president
nixon’s
veto
of
a
minimum
wage
bill,
comments
about
oil
industry
profits
and
requested
employees
to
register
to
vote.
over
one
half
of
section
3
was
concerned
with
oil
industry
profits.
sections
2
and
3
of
the
circular
made
up
the
bulk.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
petitioner
had
taken
a
stand
either
pro
or
con
with
relation
to
any
matter
discussed
in
sections
2
or
3.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
union
had
previously
publicized
its
political
messages
by
mail
and
with
lists
furnished
by
eastex
and
that
its
only
reason
for
requesting
in-plant
distribution
of
this
circular
was
increased
mailing
cost.
there
is
no
evidence
that
distribution
off
the
plant
premises
was
impractical.
the
administrative
law
judge
decided
the
case
solely
on
section
7
grounds,
no
consideration
of
eastex’s
property
rights
was
made.
the
board
pro
forma
affirmed.
the
fifth
circuit
originally
granted
enforcement
under
section
7
and
the
first
amendment
and
adopted
the
holding
that
the
union
could
distribute
whatever
is
reasonably
related
to
the
employees'
jobs
or
status
or
condition
as
employees
to
the
full
range
permitted
by
section
7’s
language,
valid
local
laws
and
the
first
amendment.
on
motion
for
rehearing,
the
court
excised
its
first
amendment
references,
but
denied
rehearing.
the
basic
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
mutual
aid
or
protection
language
of
section
7
of
the
act
protects
a
distribution
on
an
employer’s
premises
which
is
political
in
nature
and
is
not
significantly
related
to
the
employees'
immediate
employment
relationship.
that
issue
divides
into
two
parts;
whether
the
mutual
aid
or
protection
language
of
section
7
protects
political
expression
and
if
it
found
that
it
does,
does
the
nature
and
strength
of
such
a
right
mandate
or
warrant
the
interference
with
the
employer’s
property
rights
which
is
inherent
in
an
in-plant
distribution.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
that
is
part
of
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
mutual
aid
or
protection
language
of
section
7
protects
political
expression,
but
to
the
extent
that
republic
aviation
states
that
there
is
a
right
to
in-plant
distribution,
that
case
is
of
course
limited
by
its
terms
to
in-plant
distribution
by
employees
relating
to
organizational
effort.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no
sir
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
board
and
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
this
case
was
to
use
the
presumptive
invalidity
of
the
refusal
to
distribution,
the
presumptive
rule
of
right
to
distribute
on
an
employee’s
property,
growing
out
of
republic
aviation
was
of
course
based
on
the
organizational
efforts
of
employees
under
the
fundamental
provisions
or
the
fundamental
rights
of
section
7.
we
are
asked
in
the
court
to
declare
that
political
activity
on
an
employer’s
premises
is
unprotected.
otherwise,
the
possible
consequences
of
allowing
unions
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
are
you
arguing
both
of
them
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
unprotected.
it
is
our
further
position
that
it
is
unprotected
on
the
employer’s
premises
as
a
separate
and
distinct
issue.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
that
is
right.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
i
would
challenge
the
right
to
do
so
under
the
provisions
of
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
section
7
establishes
the
rights
of
employees
in
dealing
with
their
employer.
it
does
not
establish
the
rights
of
employees
as
citizens
to
engage
an
off
plant
political
activity.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir,
but
you
asked
me
not
in
the
context
of
a
union
organization,
but
just
whether
it
had
anything
to
do
with
employees
handing
out
political
literature.
it
does
not.
it
defines
only
certain
rights
within
the
employer/employee
relationship.
it
is
our
position
that
nothing
in
the
act
prevents
an
employer
from
discharging
or
refusing
to
hire
an
employee
because
of
his
political
beliefs
or
actions
as
a
citizen,
not
as
an
employee.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no,
sir,
i
am
not
so
contending.
i
am
contending
that
the
right
to
distribute
literature
in-plant
is
limited
to
literature
that
is
related
to
the
fundamental
employee
rights
to
organization,
collective
bargaining,
to
join
and
assist
labor
organization,
that
it
does
not
extend
to
the
distribution
of
political
literature.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir,
it
would
have
been.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon
sit.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
they
are
not
--
four
is
at
least
relating
to
or
could
be
considered
as
union
institutional
literature,
not
related
to
the
question
of
political
beliefs.
bear
in
mind,
we
are
talking
in
sections
2
and
3
about
political
matters
and
that
was
the
issue
there,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
my
view
that
that
is
unprotected
for
distribution
on
the
employer's
premises.
that
is
essentially
the
case
before
us
today
--
before
this
court
today.
i
said
that
the
purpose
of
what
the
board
and
the
court
have
done
would
be
to
politicize
the
workplace
on
issues
or
candidates
it
supports
or
objects
to.
the
board
admits
as
much
on
page
34
of
its
brief.
we
believe
that
this
court
should
draw
the
same
sharp
distinction
between
political
activity
and
traditional
and
fundamental
union
representation
activity
that
it
drew
in
international
association
of
machinists
vs.
street
and
more
recently,
in
abood
vs.
detroit
board
of
education,
certainly
in
a
different
context.
this
court
recognized
in
street
and
abood,
the
separation
between
a
union’s
pursuit
of
its
traditional
role
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
its
ancillary
role
as
a
political,
social
and
fraternal
organization.
we
would
also
state
to
the
court
that
thus
it
is
clear
that
section
7
is
not
coextensive
with
the
first
amendment
as
the
board
and
the
court
below
impliedly
assert,
nor
is
the
employer’s
plant
a
public
park
or
a
marketplace
of
ideas.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no
sir,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
case.
this
is
a
section
7
case,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
board
and
the
court
below
have
impliedly
made
it
a
first
amendment
case.
by
the
assertion
that
the
board
makes
in
its
brief
that
the
employer
has
not
right
to
prevent
distribution
of
union
literature
so
long
as
it
does
now
disrupt
production
or
discipline
and
contains
material
relating
to
any
union
objectives,
is
a
first
amendment
argument.
no
prior
restraint
except
in
case
of
clear
or
present
danger
or
disruption.
another
fault
of
the
board
and
the
court
below
in
this
case
is
the
assertion
and
the
finding
that
the
term
employee
used
in
section
7
of
the
act
encompasses
the
generic
employee
as
a
worker
of
the
world
and
that
petitioner's
employees
are
protected
under
section
7
in
rendering
“mutual
aid
or
protection
to
such
workers
as
a
broad
class.”
this
is
also
inherent
in
the
court’s
rationale.
certainly
the
language
of
section
2
and
3
of
the
act
defining
employee,
encompasses
more
than
employees
of
a
particular
employer,
but
we
submit
that
it
is
no
broader
than
the
definition
of
labor
dispute
found
in
section
29
of
the
act
and
that
a
union’s
rights
to
distribute
on
our
premises
or
to
deal
in
relationship
with
employees
as
workers
is
no
broader
than
the
definition
of
labor
organization
found
in
the
provisions
of
section
25
of
the
act.
we
might
add
to
this
court
that
the
board
itself
has
found
that
political
literature
is
not
protected
wherein
the
ford
motor
company
case,
it
stated
wholly
political
propaganda,
not
related
to
employee’s
problems
and
concerns
while
employees
can
be
prohibited.
the
board
and
the
court
below
would
distinguish
the
particular
political
expression
used
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
reasonably
related
to
the
employee’s
jobs
or
their
status
or
condition
as
employees
in
the
plant.
apart
from
such
rationale,
the
court
below
would
apparently
agree
that
it
was
unprotected.
as
our
brief
points
out,
the
logical
extension
of
such
a
rule
would
result
in
the
politicalization
of
the
workplace.
but
we
have
also
pointed
out,
the
court’s
finding
results
from
the
court’s
consideration
of
the
term
employee
as
used
in
section
7
of
the
act
in
the
generic
sense
which
is
overly
broad
and
we
submit
is
in
error
and
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
act
to
regulate
the
relations
between
an
employer
and
his
employees
or
the
limited
intrusion
on
an
employer’s
property
rights
allowed
by
this
court.
place
is
of
equal
concern
in
defining
section
7
rights
as
is
substance
or
actions
taken.
it
is
only
by
limiting
the
protections
of
the
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
language
of
section
7
to
in-plant
distributions
which
concern
a
matter
significantly
connected
to
the
employee’s
relationship
to
their
employer
that
the
policies
of
the
acts,
the
conflicts
between
opposing
rights
and
the
practical
operation
of
employer/employee
relations
can
be
reconciled
and
harmonized.
this
court
has
never
said
and
should
not
say
here
that
any
yielding
of
an
employer’s
property
rights
is
necessary,
except
where
an
employer
–
except
where
they
are
in
conflict
with
the
fundamental
right
of
self
organization,
representation
and
collective
bargaining.
as
this
court
said
in
central
hardware
and
i
quote,
“this
principle
requires
a
yielding
of
property
rights
only
in
the
context
of
an
organization
campaign.
absent
such
a
yielding,
there
is
no
section
7
right
on
an
employer’s
property.”
republic
aviation
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
required
a
yielding
only
in
the
posture
that
prohibition
of
in-plant
solicitation
was
an
unreasonable
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
self
organization
and
then
only
on
non-work
time
and
in
non-work
areas.
babcock
&
wilcox
did
not
require
such
a
yielding
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
a
special
need,
but
again
in
an
organizing
context.
magnavox
cited
by
the
board
in
its
brief
was
a
waiver
case,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
dealt
with
the
problem,
it
was
concerned
with
fundamental
section
7
rights.
a
key
footnote
omitted
in
the
magnavox
quotation
in
the
board’s
brief
makes
it
clear
that
this
court
has
not
extended
republic
aviation
as
the
board
asserts.
that
footnote
states
to
indicate
consideration
of
alternative
means
of
communication
is
at
least
a
part
of
the
range
of
any
inquiry
into
the
need
for
in-plant
solicitation
if
section
7
rights
are
to
be
protected.
republic,
babcock
&
wilcox
and
magnavox
can
be
delineated
as
who
and
where
cases
in
connection
with
self
organization.
this
case
–
this
eastex
case
seeks
to
define
what
can
be
distributed.
section
7
does
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
section
7
rights
coexist
with
other
competing
interests
and
as
this
court
has
stated,
the
exercise
of
such
rights
must
be
balanced
against
such
competing
interest
to
determine
where
they
fall
on
this
spectrum.
organizational
activity
is
obviously
an
overriding
consideration
under
the
act,
but
even
there,
it
has
been
circumscribed.
political
expression
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
if
it
protected
at
all.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
that
is
protected
activity
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no
sir,
but
he
is
engaging
in
primary
fundamental
rights
and
he
is
not
engaging
in
that
activity
on
the
employer’s
premises.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
or
the
employer’s
time.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
we
would
state
that
in
that
context,
it
would
be
the
employer
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
that
distribution
in
the
same
sense
that
it
would
have
the
right
to
prohibit
a
distribution
by
the
union
of
literature
extolling
its
parade
or
extolling
its
softball
team
and
suggesting
that
people
come
out
and
join
the
softball
team
for
the
game
with
local
idew.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
your
honor
that
is
a
–
really
it
is
a
closer
question,
but
the
protection
if
any
that
such
an
employee
would
receive
under
the
act
--
under
section
7
of
the
act
which
establishes
those
protections,
would
be
the
question
of
whether
he
was
assisting
a
labor
organization.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
well
sir,
i
will
give
you
a
good
example
of
that.
an
employee
on
strike
against
his
employer
has
a
right
to
picket
that
employer,
but
he
has
no
right
to
do
that
to
exercise
that
fundamental
section
7
right
on
the
employer’s
premises
nor
does
he
have
a
right
as
an
employee
or
as
a
union
member
to
go
on
someone
else’s
premises
for
the
purposes
of
organizing.
that
is
what
babcock
&
wilcox
held.
of
course,
you
can
always
consider
the
fansteel
situation
where
they
sit
down
on
the
employers
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
it
was
not.
that
political
activity
is
not
protected
under
section
7.
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
white
that
it
is
a
lot
closer
question,
but
it
is
not
directed
to
fundamental
employee
rights.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
no
sir,
if
it
is
off
on
the
employer’s
time,
did
you
say
off
or
on
mr.
justice
burger?
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
section
7
has
nothing
to
do
with
political
activity
is
what
i
said.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes,
sir.
he
can
discharge
a
republican
if
he
does
not
like
republicans.
he
can
discharge
a
democrat
if
he
does
not
like
democrats
and
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
protect
that
employee.
the
distribution
off
of
the
employee
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
it
would
be
a
rather
ill
placed
act
of
an
employer
to
discharge
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
it
certainly
would
not
be
just
cause.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
it
is
the
employer’s
property
that
we
are
talking
about
mr.
justice
stevens
and
we
have
a
right
subject
to
the
limitation…
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
we
would
prefer
that
nothing
be
distributed
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
because
it
is
political
material
which
is
not
related
to
the
employee’s
relationship
with
the
employer.
we
do
not
want
--
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes,
sir.
i
would
certainly.
according
to
the
board’s
theory,
and
according
to
the
logical
extension
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
rule,
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
go
from
the
distribution
of
this
material
to
the
distribution
of
handbills
or
literature
solely
supporting
a
candidate
for
public
office
who
for
one
reason
or
another
has
promised
that
he
would
support
a
labor
organization
and
its
goals
and
efforts.
mr.
john

abercrombie
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
our
right
to
do
it
and
the
question
really
then
turns
into
one
of
what
you
are
going
to
do
go
into
a
word
count
as
to
whether
it
is
protected
or
unprotected.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
abercrombie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
board's
focus
in
this
argument
is
wrong.
we
are
not
talking
about
section
7
as
a
whole.
we
are
only
talking
about
non
fundamental
rights
under
the
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
language
of
section
7.
the
suggested
rule
which
we
have
advanced
in
our
brief
has
application
only
in
this
context
and
i
would
respond
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
of
the
basis
for
his
decision.
he
simply
cited
the
presumption
of
invalidity
by
the
--
because
of
the
limited
distribution
or
the
limitation
on
distribution
of
this
material
on
the
employer’s
premises.
the
board
and
the
court
below
have
placed
the
cart
before
the
horse
on
the
matter
of
accommodation
of
section
7
rights
to
property
rights.
i
note
mr.
allen’s
reference
to
our
naked
property
right.
we
are
quite
proud
of
that
naked
property
right
and
believe
that
we
have
a
right
to
enforce
it
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
this
country
except
in
those
instances
where
they
would
amount
to
an
unreasonable
impediment
to
the
organization
of
employees
on
the
employer’s
premises.
the
board
would
adopt
a
presumption
of
right
of
any
section
7
rights,
presumably,
including
the
right
to
picket
on
the
employer’s
premises
in
the
absence
of
showing
by
the
employer
of
special
circumstances.
certainly
no
balancing
was
undertaken
in
this
case.
the
presumption
alluded
to
by
the
board
only
relates
to
distributions
affecting
fundamental
section
rights,
particularly
the
right
to
organize.
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
presumption
is
applicable
to
any
union
distribution
regardless
of
its
content.
the
distinction
between
what
is
distributable
and
appliant
is
one
of
substance
in
the
same
sense
as
that
issue
was
addressed
in
babcock
and
wilcox.
there
the
board
made
the
same
assertion
that
it
did
hear
that
republic
aviation
established
a
presumption
of
the
right
of
a
non-employee
organizer
to
enter
the
employer's
premises
for
the
purposes
of
organizing.
the
court
held
that
here
was
no
such
presumption.
that
only
by
showing
of
special
need
to
do
so
could
a
non-employee
enter
the
employee's
premises.
we
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
accommodation
made
in
this
case.
but
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
literature
that
is
being
distributed,
political
in
nature.
that
the
accommodation
must
necessarily
fall
on
the
right
of
the
employer
to
prohibit
such
distribution
in
the
exercise
of
his
property
rights
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
distribution
of
political
material
on
the
employers
premises
is
and
cannot
be
allowed
under
the
provisions
of
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
