mr.
abercrombie,
i
suppose
they
urge
them
to
vote
for
minimum
wage,
that
is
political?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
want
census
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
give
you
an
easy
one.
urging
the
workers
to
support
era
and
to
oppose
airplanes
to
the
arab
countries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
support
the
era?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
think
that
there
will
be
a
little
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
you
do
not
think
all
of
them
would
agree
one
way
or
the
other,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
not
think
the
employer
would
prefer
not
to
have
dispute
among
his
employees?
my
whole
point
is
do
you
have
to
say
this
is
wide
open?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
say
who
decides
the
boundaries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
boundary
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
ab-furniture
factory
they
pass
out
a
leaflet
saying
in
the
xy
furniture
factory
they
have
a
better
working
contract,
therefore,
we
urge
all
of
the
workers
in
this
plant
to
buy
their
furniture
from
the
competitor,
he
could
not
protect
himself
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
disparaging
the
product
it
was
just
taking
the
money
i
was
buying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
they
have
a
better
working
contract
over
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hate
to
see
an
employer
to
have
to
pay
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
that
i
said
before,
i
think
we
are
in
a
place
where
the
lines
are
burning,
smoky?
