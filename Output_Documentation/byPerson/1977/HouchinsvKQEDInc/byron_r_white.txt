justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
earlier
in
your
argument
that
the
sheriff
was
now
willing
to
or
has
been
willing
to
give
the
press
greater
access
than
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
is
critical
to
your
case.
was
that
the
word
that
you
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
mean
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wholly
inconsistent
with
your
present
argument.
if
it
were
critical.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
--
according
to
your
present
argument
you
could
eliminate
that
special
privilege
for
the
press.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
you
tell
me
where
in
your
briefs
you
described
this
special
press
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
in
your
opening
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
some
member
and
my
other
question
is
if
some
members
of
the
public;
non-press
members,
said
we
would
like
to
go
with
the
press
tour
with
our
cameras.
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
public
does
not
have
as
much
right
as
the
press?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
the
press
sued
that
--
what
if
the
private
person,
the
one
that
goes
with
the
press
tour
with
his
cameras
and
he
sued.
what
would
you
say,
what
would
you
say
that
he
has
no
--
would
you
say
you
are
not
required
to
give
him
the
equal
access
with
the
press.
in
short
that
the
press
has
a
greater
privilege.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
my
worry
is
that
where
do
you
describe
that
or
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
at
the
time,
at
the
time
this
suite
was
started
could
a
member
of
the
press
interview
a
prisoner,
during
visiting
hours
if
the
prisoner
was
willing
to
be
interviewed?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
press?
and
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
recording
the
interview
with
a
willing
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
photograph?
a
willing
a
photograph?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
rule?
what
is
the
rule
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
visitors
on
visiting.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
did
not
order,
a
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
thought
the,
it
is
not
the
only
issue
here,
the
propriety
of
the
injunction
that
was
issued
ordering
a
special
tours
for
the
press
with
cameras
and
recording
equipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
do
you
think
the
issue
is
here,
just
tell
me?.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it,
according
to
the
opinions
was
whether
or
not
granting
the
press,
access
to
the
prison
different
from
the
public
that
was
proper
or
was
necessary
and
that
is
the
question
that
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
defend
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
sole
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
whether,
not
generally
whether
all,
whether
the
sheriff
has
a
satisfactory
access
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
issue
is
whether
this
injunction
is
giving
a
special
privilege
to
the
press
is
constitutionally
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
know
but
that
is
what
you
have
got
and
if
you
say
you
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
you
must
defend
that
proposition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
said,
they
have
expressly
held
that
a
special
privilege
to
the
press
what
was
quite
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so,
but
in
this
case
the
only
issue
is
the
special
privilege
to
the
press,
that
is
the
only
question
that
was
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
the
one
we
granted.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
should
we
listen
to
any
other
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
still
ask
you
what
do
you
think
the
question
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
and
that
is
before
the
court
and
i
would
not
doubt
that
the
sheriff
would
like
to
get
the
press
out
of
his
hair,
but
the
issue
here
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
remedy
granted
by
the
district
court
giving
special
access
to
the
press.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
said
that
it
was
quite
proper
and
apparently
thought
it
was
constitutionally
required.
otherwise
i
do
not
know
how
the
district
judge
had
any
business
ordering
the
press,
ordering
the
sheriff
to
issue
special
access
to
the
press.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
must
have
thought
it
was
constitutionally
required
in
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
want,
but
i
gather
then
that
you
think
the
constitution
required
the
injunction
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
access,
special
access
that
is
what
it
did.
