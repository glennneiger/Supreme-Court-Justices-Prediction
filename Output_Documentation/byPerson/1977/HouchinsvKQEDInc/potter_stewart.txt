justice
potter
stewart
it
has
an
addition
to
these
rights,
the
public
additional
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
under
the
existing
regime,
the
media
has
all
these
same
rights
that
the
public
has
of
access.
justice
potter
stewart
plus
some
additional
ones
that
have
been
granted
to
it
by
the
sheriff's
office.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
not
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
perfectly
logical
position
to
take.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
court
held
in
pell
was
as
i
understood
it
and
writing
it
was
that
the
press
had
no
right
of
access
superior
to
that
of
the
general
public.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
hold,
it
did
not
deal
with
whether
or
not
the
general
public
had
any
right
whatsoever.
that
is
counted
under
the
constitution,
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
provisions
of
that
document.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
i
presume
access
under
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
at
any
reasonable
time?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
do
claim
i
suppose
you
certainly
could
reasonably
claim
that
even
though
the
right
of
access
of
the
communications
media
is
no
greater
than
that
of
general
public
that
perhaps
because
of
the
technical
needs
of
communications
need
media,
if
the
equality
needs
to
be
provided
in
a
different
kind
of
way.
in
other
words
let
us
say
that
there
is
a
right
there
that
under
the
existing
rules
and
regulations
that
public
can
go
through
the
certain
rooms
of
the
white
house
within
certain
hours
everyday.
well
the
press
could
not
set
up
its
television
cameras
then
and
there
and
interfere
then
they
each
should
interfering
with
each
other,
but
certainly
there
is
an
equivalent
availability
to
the
communications
media
of
the
same
sort
of
public
access
to
those
rooms
in
the
white
house
that
are
open
to
the
public,
but
that
might
require
a
special
arrangements
for
you
to
make
to
setup
your
television
cameras
or
something
else
at
an
hour
when
the
public
in
fact
is
not
there.
justice
potter
stewart
just
in
order
to
preserve
and
provide
the
very
equality
to
which
the
media
is
entitled.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
far
does
you
argument
go?
there
are
many
areas
would
not
you
agree
that
to
which
the
public
does
not
in
fact
have
access,
let
say
to
the
oval
office
in
the
white
house,
no
general
right
of
access
by
the
general
public
at
any
time
during
the
24
hours
of
each
day
with
seven
day
a
week
and
to
that
extent,
there
is
no
access
period
and
to
that
extent
the
public
does
not
know
what
goes
on
in
there.
justice
potter
stewart
it
knows
only
through
press
officers
at
the
white
house
and
yet
does
that
mean
that
for
some
reason
or
another
the
fact
that
the
public
is
not
admitted
at
all
that
the
press
then
must
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
what
is
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
assume
in
this
particular
county
jail
the
public
was
not
admitted
at
all,
except
in
terms
of
the
--
that
is
the
general
public
members
of
the
families
were
and
lawyers
were
and
doctors
were.
let
the
general
public
know
by
that
very
fact
does
the
press
then
gain
access,
that
seems
to
be
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
talking
here
not
about
policy
or
prudential
considerations
or
wisdom
or
lack
of
it,
we
are
taking
about
what
is
required
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
else
this
case
should
not
be
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
then
does
the
mere
fact
that
the
public
does
not
have
access
in
thereby
confer
a
right
upon
the
press
to
access.
that
is
a
brand
new
doctrine
that
i
have
never
heard
of.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
they
are
from
many
areas,
of
public
life,
of
a
governmental
life,
they
are
excluded
from
the
war
room
over
in
the
pentagon
and
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
various
parts
of
the
cia
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
various
private
meetings
of
all
sort
of
commissions
in
courts
and
everything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
maybe
other
reasons
that
the
public
is
not
given
access
and
outside
from
the
confidentiality.
the
reasons
of
security
or
discipline
or
the
very
fact
that
a
jail
is
a
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
a
troop
could,
a
commander
of
a
military
station
could
certainly
keep
members
of
the
public
out
of
observing
certain
troop
activities,
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
it
maybe
part
of
the
punitive
policy
of
a
particular
governmental
agency
might
be
that
in
this
jail
you
are
not
going
to
have
members
of
the
general
public
around.
we
are
going
to
--
this
is
the
maximum
security
institution
and
one
of
the
conditions
in
this
jail
is
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
associate
even
peripherally
with
the
members
of
the
general
public.
why
would
not
that
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
governmental
interests.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
does
not
have
to,
it
is
you
who
are
attacking
what
he
has
done.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
you
who
are
saying
what
he
has
done
is
unconstitutional,
violative
of
the
united
states
constitution.
he
does
not
have
to
justify
that
have
to
invalidate
it.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
it
seems,
why
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
might
it
not
be
a
very
appropriate
way
of
doing
precisely
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
filed
in
the
court
and
their
matters
is
a
public
record
available
to
the
press,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
nice
place
you
would
go
with
a
notebook?
justice
potter
stewart
sheriff
houchins,
we
have
been
told
is
an
elected
official.
do
you
know
for
how
longer
term?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
if
he
is
how
many
terms
he
has
served
if
more
than
one?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
is
in
his
first
term?
justice
potter
stewart
the
judgment
of
the
court
this
morning
is
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
turn
affirmed
the
terms
of
the
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
and
i
agree
that
the
preliminary
injunction
issued
against
the
petitioner,
sheriff
of
the
county
of
alameda,
california
was
unwarranted
and
therefore
i
concur
the
judgment,
but
in
my
view
kqed
which
is
a
television
station
was
clearly
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
of
somewhat
more
limited
scope
than
that
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
do
not
guarantee
the
public
a
right
of
access
to
information
generated
or
controlled
by
government,
and
they
do
not
guarantee
the
press
any
basic
right
of
access
superior
to
that
of
the
public
generally.
the
constitution
does
no
more
than
assure
the
public
and
the
press
equal
access
once
government
has
opened
its
doors.
on
that
score,
i
agree
substantially
with
what
the
chief
justice
has
said
in
his
written
opinion,
what
he
has
announced
early
this
morning.
but
we
part
company
in
applying
these
abstractions
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
concept
of
equal
access
must
be
accorded
flexibility
in
order
to
accommodate
the
practical
distinctions
between
the
press
and
the
general
public.
a
journalist
does
not
tour
a
jail
simply
for
his
own
edification.
he
is
there
to
gather
information
to
be
passed
on
to
others,
and
his
mission
is
protected
by
the
constitution
for
very
specific
reasons.
that
the
first
amendment
speaks
separately
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
is
no
constitutional
accident,
but
an
acknowledgment
of
the
critical
role
played
by
the
press
in
american
society
under
our
constitution.
in
my
view,
kqed
was
clearly
entitled
to
some
form
of
preliminary
injunctive
relief
in
this
case.
at
the
time
of
the
district
court's
decision,
members
of
the
public
were
permitted
to
visit
most
parts
of
the
santa
rita
jail,
and
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
required
the
sheriff
to
give
members
of
the
press
effective
access
to
the
same
areas.
the
sheriff
evidently
assumed
that
he
could
fulfill
this
obligation
simply
by
allowing
reporters
to
sign
up
for
tours
on
the
same
terms
as
members
of
the
public.
and
that
is
i
take
it
is
the
view
of
the
plurality
opinion
this
morning.
i
think
that
is
a
mistaken
view
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
policy.
because
however,
the
preliminary
injunction
exceeded
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
in
some
respects
and
as
issued
by
the
district
court,
i
agree
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
district
court's
order
must
be
reversed.
but
the
possibility
of
further
relief
for
kqed
on
remand
is
not
foreclosed.
the
availability
and
scope
of
future
permanent
injunctive
relief
must
depend
upon
the
extent
of
access
then
permitted
to
public,
and
the
decree
must
be
framed
to
accommodate
equitably
the
constitutional
role
of
the
press
and
the
institutional
requirements
of
the
jail.
and
it
is
on
that
basis
and
only
on
that
basis
that
i
have
joined
the
judgment
of
the
court.
