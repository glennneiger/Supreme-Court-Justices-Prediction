justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
booty
you
have
been
outlining,
what
i
gather
are
general
rule,
general
policies
of
the
sheriff's
office.
are
these
designed
to
cover
the
situation
supposing
a
riot
had
broken
out
in
the
jail
or
in
some
event
a
particular
newsworthiness,
would
these
regulations
have
necessarily
governed
press
or
public
access
under
those
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
public
right,
are
you
talking
about
some
term
that
has
meaning
in
constitutional
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
sheriff
of
alameda
county
an
elected
official?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
presume
if
the
public
in
alameda
county
thought
they
were
not
getting
enough
access
they
could
vote
against
him
in
the
next
election?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
other
right
of
access
does
the
public
have?
i
mean
under,
say
under
the
decided
cases
of
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
not
pell
really
a
decision
that
said
whatever
the
public
access
is
the
media
access
need
to
be
no
greater.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
unjustifiably
interfering
with
acquisition
of
information
for
publication
then
it
is
a
justiciable
question
in
every
case
whether
for
instance
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
excludes
the
press
from
its
conferences
or
whether
the
federal
aviation
administration
excludes
the
press
from
its
executive
sessions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
--
you
are
tested
any
way.
it
is
something
that
subject
to
constitutional
inquiry
by
a
court
that
can
decide
constitutional
questions,
whether
the
decision
of
any
governmental
official
to
exclude
the
press
from
any
part
of
the
public
domain
under
his
control
is
called
“justifiable”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
only
because
that
is
a
justifiable
decision
on
the
part.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
each
case,
you
could
go
into
the
united
states
district
court
of
whatever
district
you
want
and
under
1331
argue
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
decision
of
the
particular
agency
was
justifiable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
what
should
be
properly
made
public
and
what
has
no
claim
to
confidentiality
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
have
to
make
out
your
claim
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
so
when
you
say
that
something
has
no
claim
to
confidentiality
that
must
be
a
part
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
otherwise
you
cannot
prevail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
not
each
of
those
people
who
have
the
right
of
access
to
a
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
has
not
this
court
held
they
have
right
of
access
to
court
at
any
day
(ph)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cannot
you
not
go
into
interview
him
on
a
particular
day?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
not
you
verify
or
corroborate
his
story
or
further
develop
it
in
such
an
interview?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
should
the
press
take
the
president's
press
secretary's
word
for
what
the
president's
view
was
are
without
going
to
the
oval
office
and
checking
him
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
this
is
the
way
they
do
business
in
alameda
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
interview,
you
mean
the
television
equipment
and
the
tape
recorders.
you
can
simply
go
and
interview
a
prisoner
during
visiting
hours
without
the
four
requirements?
