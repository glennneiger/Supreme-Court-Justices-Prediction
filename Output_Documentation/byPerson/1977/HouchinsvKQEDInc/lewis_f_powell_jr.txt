justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
opportunity
did
members
of
the
media
have
to
become
one
of
the
25
admitted
on
these
tours?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
basically
the
tours
were
organized
on
a
first
come
first
serve
basis.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
one
of
the
briefs
or
the
records
state
opinion
that
they
were
overbooked
some
weeks
in
advance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
so
if
there
were
some
occurrence
in
the
jail
that
might
have
been
of
public
interest
there
would
be
no
way
for
representing
it
to
the
media
to
get
into
the
jail
unless
he
had
been
signed
up
several
weeks
in
advance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
still
outlining
access
that
was
available.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr
turner
before
you
proceed,
i
am
now
confused
as
to
the
facts
with
respect
to
personal
interviews
by
a
representative
of
the
media
with
a
preselected
inmate.
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier,
perhaps
i
am
narrow
to
say
that
there
were
four
preconditions
to
such
an
interview
including
the
court
approval?
