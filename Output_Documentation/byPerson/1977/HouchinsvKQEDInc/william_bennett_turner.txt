mr.
william
bennett
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
first
of
i
would
like
to
correct
the
state
of
the
evidence.
the
sheriff
has
never,
since
he
has
been
in
office,
held
a
special
tour
for
the
press;
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
all
he
said
when
it
became
clear
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case
is
that
he
would
be
willing
if
the
court
was
going
to
grant
preliminary
injunctive
relief
to
live
with
a
special
tour
for
the
press
in
which
they
could
bring
their
cameras
and
do
their
business
in
that
way.
he
has
never
implemented
that
offer.
and
in
context
that
offer
was
only
to
be
carried
out
if
the
district
court
was
going
to
order
him
to
do
anything
more
than
he
was
otherwise
willing
to
do.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
think
it
is
permissible.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
for
an
administrator
of
the
jail
or
a
prison
to
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
a
constitutional
question
arises
when
as
in
this
case
the
sheriff
limits
access
by
reporters
either
to
zero
as
before
this
case
was
filed
or
to
these
antiseptic
guided
tours
that
he
initiated
right
after
we
filed
suit.
there
is
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
do,
if
that
access
is
zero
or
if
the
access
is
not
reasonably
sufficient
to
prevent
consummative
conditions
in
the
jail,
then
we
would
have
a
situation
as
they
have
in
south
africa
where
the
press
is
effectively
precluded
from
reporting
on
jail
and
prison
conditions.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
i
think
it
would
trivialize
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
it
requires
specific
things
like
a
particular
number
of
days
a
week
or
photographs
or
random
interviews
as
opposed
to
full
interviews
with
individuals
and
so
on.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
the
first
amendment
does.
what
the
first
amendment
does
is
prohibit
a
government
official
from
unjustifiably
interfering
with
the
acquisition
of
information
for
the
publication.
that
is
was
this
case
is
about.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
i
do
not
about
justiciable.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
that
is
our
position.
our
position
of
course
is
not
that
the
press
is
entitled
to
sit
in
on
conferences
of
this
court,
any
court,
any
administrative
agency
and
so
on.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
and
the
information
has
some
claim
to
confidentiality.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
theoretically
yes,
but
in
fact
there
are
not
any
other
agencies
that
we
are
aware
of,
that
treats
information
the
way
the
sheriff
does.
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
jails
and
prisons
and
the
area
are
completely
open
to
the
press
and
they
may
enter
and
go
into
the
maximum
security
sections,
talk
with
prisoners,
interview
prisoners,
take
pictures
whatever
they
want
to
do.
those
are
the
institutions
where
one
would
assume
public
access
is
rather
limited
and
justifiably
so.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
of
course
not.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
because
it
shows
how
unjustifiable
the
sheriff's
practice
is.
that
there
is
no
valid
interest.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
i
think,
i
do
not
know
what
the
president's
reasons
might
be
for
opening
cabinet
meetings.
but
surely
in
the
context
of
a
court,
where
there
is
deliberation
going
on
where
there
has
to
be
a
freedom
to
take
opposite
points
of
view
then
we
will
ultimately
be
handed
down
a
decision,
that
kind
of
discussion
just
has
to
by
its
very
nature
be
confidential.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
have
to,
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
it
is
only
relevant
to
show
how
unjustifiable
this
sheriff's
practice
is.
it
is
not
dispositive
in
the
case
of
this
court
or
any
other
court,
where
there
might
be
radically
different
considerations.
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
steven's
opening
question
about
the
state
of
access
when
the
suit
was
filed.
there
was
none.
until
the
suit
was
filed,
conditions
in
this
jail
were
concealed
from
the
public
because
the
sheriff
completely
excluded
both
press
and
the
public
from
the
facility.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
an
attorney
could
go
out
and
interview
his
client
in
the
visiting
room.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
of
course
and
of
course
there
was
mail
by
prisoners
to
people
on
the
outside
at
the
time
we
filed
suit
the
sheriff's
rule
for
the
bad
prisoners,
from
mentioning
the
name
or
action
of
any
officer,
that
was
changed
immediately
after
we
filed
a
suit.
but
of
course
there
was
social
mail
and
so
on,
there
was
visiting
with
family
and
friends,
that
serves
the
purpose
of
not
cutting
prisoners
off
from
the
outside
world.
they
can
maintain
some
contact.
but
it
does
not
serve
the
purpose
of
informing
the
public
what
is
going
on
in
this
jail
and
of
the
conduct
of
an
elected
sheriff's
office.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
practice
as
i
understand
it
was
that
anybody
could
visit
any
prisoner.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
if
you
happen
to
know
one.
if
you
happen
to
know
of
somebody
you
could
out
and
ask
for
them.
and
if
they
were
willing
to
talk
with
you,
you
could
talk
with
them
in
the
visiting
area.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
that
would
not
have
been
permitted.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
would
not
have
been
permitted
unless
reporters
obtained
the
four
consents
mentioned
by
counsel,
the
prisoner
himself;
that
is
certainly
reasonable,
his
lawyer;
that
is
certainly
reasonable
and
the
sheriff
required
the
consent
of
the
district
attorney;
for
reasons
unknown
to
us
and
unexplained
and
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
this
is
not
a
gag
rule
problem.
this
was
standard
procedure
that
made
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
have
any
interviews.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
same
rule.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
same
rule,
that
has
not
changed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
the
only
feasible
way
that
the
public
at
large
will
know
what
is
going
on
in
in
this
jail
is
if
reporters
are
allowed
in.
a
handful
of
people
can
go
on
the
tours,
but
reporters
acting
as
agent
for
the
public
at
large,
the
eyes
and
the
ears
of
the
public
at
large,
can
go
in
and
without
any
disruption
to
jail
routine
because
it
is
done
routinely
in
all
of
the
other
jails
and
prisons
in
the
area,
can
meet
this
public
need
without
interfering
with
any
purpose,
valid
purpose
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
it
would
not
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
helpful.
but
such
visiting
board
could
only
and
where
they
do
exist,
do
only
go
on
a
very
occasional
basis
to
the
facility
and
do
an
inspection.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
if
they
were
charged
with
a
gathering
information
about
an
event
of
public
concern
and
were
in
a
position
to
go
out
to
the
jail
and
investigate,
find
out
what
happen,
report
it
to
the
public
promptly
that
would
serve
the
same
purpose.
now
the
sheriff
in
answering
why
should
not
reporters
be
allowed
to
do
their
job,
same
job
done
in
other
jails
and
prisons
in
the
area,
points
to
the
courts
decisions
in
pell
and
saxbe
and
his
core
position
is
that
all
that
he
needs
to
do
is
provide
quality
of
access,
not
access,
but
equality
is
the
way
he
reads
those
decisions.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
think
that
the
whole
assumption
of
the
pell
and
saxbe
decisions
is
that
there
be
reasonably
sufficient
access
to
prevent
concealment
of
conditions.
if
there
is
that
then
equality
is
fine.
we
do
not
claim
any
superior
rights
for
the
press.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
exactly.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
court's
holdings
in
pell
and
saxbe.
there
was
rather
full
access
there,
reporters
could
enter
the
institutions,
go
to
the
maximum
security
sections,
talk
with
prisoners
they
are
randomly
encountered,
take
photographs,
the
only
thing
that
could
not
do,
the
only
purposes
for
which
access
was
then
denied
was
to
single
out
individual
prisoners
and
make
media
heroes
out
of
them,
have
them
interviewed,
have
them
come
to
public
attention
and
the
evidence
in
that
case
was
that,
that
indeed
created
security
problems.
the
court
appalled
that
narrow
restriction
on
access,
but
there
was
certainly
sufficient
access
to
prevent
concealment
of
conditions
in
that
prison
and
we
do
not
have
any
quarrel
either
with
the
broad
no
greater
access
statement
of
the
court
in
those
cases,
provided
but
it
is
understood
that
there
is
sufficient
access
to
prevent
concealment.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
are
not.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
it
is.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
that
was
the
situation
before
this
case
was
filed,
not
only
was
the
public
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
if
both
press
and
public
were
wholly
excluded
as
they
were
before
this
case
was
filed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
indeed
and
should
be.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
difference
between
those
kinds
of
closed
institutions
and
this
one
are
two.
first
the
information
which
is
being
discussed
in
the
cia
and
the
various
government
agencies
which
you
have
mentioned
is
information
that
properly
should
not
be
made
public.
well
here,
what
is
going
on
in
this
jail
is
information
that
has
no
claim
to
confidentiality.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
there
is
no
claim
at
all
by
the
sheriff
that
anything
that
happens
in
this
jail
should
be
held
secret
from
the
public.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
we
do
not
seek
access
to
information
that
has
any
claim
to
confidentiality.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
indeed
and
to
the
extent
there
is
a
governmental
interest.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
of
course
when
there
is
a
governmental
interest.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
indeed.
oh
of
course.
we
conceive
that,
we
believe
that
the
proper
test
is
the
one
that
this
court
used
in
martinez
before
that
in
o'brien
where
there
is
a
governmental
interest,
whether
the
interest
is
confidentiality
of
the
information
over
security
problems
or
some
other
important
governmental
interest.
of
course
access
could
be
denied.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
it
maybe
but
this
sheriff
has
never
advanced
that
consideration.
he
certainly
does
not
have.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
district
court
invalidated
it
because
it
found
that
the
interest
advanced
by
the
sheriff
were
though
important,
the
means
of
exclusion
that
he
used
were
not
necessary
to
serve
any
of
his
interests.
of
course
if
access
has
to
be
denied
during
an
emergency,
no
question
about
it.
that
is
built
in
to
the
district
court's
order.
all
that
district
court
said
is
reasonable
times,
we
see
that
as
meaning
on
reasonable
notice
and
the
sheriff
may
completely
refuse
access
at
any
time
when
he
thinks
in
his
discretion
according
to
the
district
court's
order
tensions
in
the
jail
would
authorize
him
to
close
it
down.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
second
one
is
that
this
is
an
institution
whose
purpose
is
the
involuntary
confinement
of
people,
with
an
opportunity
for
over
reaching
of
liberties
of
the
people
who
are
involuntarily
confined
and
very
little
opportunity
for
that
to
come
to
public
knowledge
unless
reporters
are
permitted
in.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
some
would
be
represented
by
the
public
defender
if
they
are
pretrial
detainees.
the
other
half
of
the
prisoners
who
are
convicted
and
serving
misdemeanor
sentences
or
short
felony
terms
do
not
as
i
understand
that
have
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
oh
of
course
and
they
could
mail
off
to
court
or
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
that
is
not
a
way
of
bringing
to
public
attention
the
sheriff's
stewardship
of
this
facility.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
it
might
if
the
writ
were
heard.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
on
the
evidence,
but
that
is
just
not
what
happens
when
prisoners
file
these
writs,
they
do
not
hold
the
plenary
hearing
and
inquire
into
conditions.
probably
99%
of
the
writs
are
denied
similarly
with
no
hearing
at
all.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
they
would
be.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
sheriff
does
not
prevent
it.
what
prevents
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
journalism.
they
are
not
going
to
print
unsubstantiated
information
received
from
a
prisoner
whether
by
letter
or
otherwise
without
an
opportunity
to
verify
the
allegations
made
by
the
prisoner.
that
is
what
is
missing
here,
cannot
go
in
when
the
prisoners
says
there
has
been
a
terrible
fire
in
the
next
cell
and
somebody
has
been
badly
injured,
nobody
can
get
in
to
find
that
out.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
you
can
visit
a
sentence
prisoner
during
the
three
hour
visiting
period
on
sundays.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
but
you
could
not
see
the
scene.
you
have
no
idea
what
the
conditions
look
like.
should
the
press
take
the
prisoner's
word
for
what
it
looks
like
and
what
happened
without
checking
it
out.
i
think
not
and
certainly
my
client
thinks
not.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
that
is
the
way
they
do
business
over
there.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
president
of
the
united
states
cannot
be
required
to
meet
the
press
by
any
constitution.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i
do
not
think
any
court
could
order
a
senator
to
sit
down
and
meet
with
the
press.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
are
not
trying
to
use
the
first
amendment
as
a
freedom
of
information
act.
we
are
not
saying
the
sheriff
has
to
come
out
and
meet
the
press
or
open
his
files
or
tell
us
when
anything
happened.
he
just
cannot
shut
the
door
to
us
on
the
ground
that
all
that
is
required
is
equality,
even
if
that
equality
is
zero.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
mysterious
system
mr.
justice
powell.
the
sheriff's
position
is
that
he
will
allow
visiting
by
practically
anyone.
so
a
reporter,
if
a
reporter
happens
to
know
somebody
at
the
jail,
kqed
reporters
do
not,
could
go
out
there
and
ask
for
that
person
during
regular
visiting
hours
and
have
a
visit
without
any
recording
equipment
or
photographs
anything
of
that
nature.
in
order
to
have
what
the
sheriff
calls
an
interview
then
the
four
formal
consents
are
required.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
if
you
know
somebody
to
ask
for
and
if
that
person
is
willing
to
talk.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
do
not
tours,
the
preliminary
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
propriety
of
the
district
court's
preliminary
injunction
which
grants
during
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
reasonable
access
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
the
way
the
sheriff
closes
the
issue.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
we
do.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
it
is.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
but
to
the
extent
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
do
not
want
a
special
privilege,
what
we
want
is
access
sufficient
to
prevent
concealment
of
the
conditions.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
we
are
also
defending
the
district
court's
order
which
provides
for
reasonable
access
and
authorizes
the
sheriff
to
figure
out
just
how
that
access
will
be
organized
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
the
way
the
sheriff
poses
the
issue.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
whether
the
constitution
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
but
this
injunction.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
does
it
in
terms
of
access
for
reporters.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
exactly,
they
want
a
reversal
which
will
be
a
message
to
jailers
throughout
this
land
that
access
is
never
required
by
the
constitution
that
is
a
position
we
oppose.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
is
whether
he
can
do
t?
mr.
william
bennett
turner
was
not
an
abusive
discretion.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
what
was
constitutionally
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
what
was
constitutionally
impermissible
was
the
sheriff's
exclusion.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it
requires
some
access
and
the
district
court
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
different
access
for
the
press
than
for
the
public
at
large,
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
but
how
that
access
is
implemented
was
expressly
left
to
the
sheriff
to
determine,
in
the
first
instant
under
the
district
court's
order.
we
hope
that
upon
remand
of
the
district
court
to
work
out
all
the
details
so
that
these
conditions
will
never
again
escape
public
scrutiny.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
am
not
sure,
i
think
it
is
a
four
year
term,
but
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
came
into
office
on
january
the
1st,
1975.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
attached
to
my
affidavit
which
is
my
affidavit
is
in
the
appendix
attached
to
that
and
in
the
record
of
the
case,
but
not
in
the
appendix
are
the
rules
that
prevail
before
a
suit
was
brought.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
