justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
booty
can
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
is
it
not
the
first
question
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
law
that
entitled
any
remedy
which
requires
an
examination
of
the
situation
at
the
time
the
law
it
was
brought.
should
not
you
not
tell
us
what
kind
of
access
there
was
when
the
proceeding
started?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
more
specifically
mr.
booty
you
do
not
seriously
contend
that
the
whole
problem
could
be
solved
by
having
zero
access
to
public
and
press
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
not
urge
the
court
to
take
that
extreme
position,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
booty
can
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
access
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
started.
one
of
the
points
was
visiting.
people
could
visit
prisoners
or
inmates
that
they
requested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
the
scope
of
the
visit
that
could
be
had,
in
others
words
could
the
visitor;
what
could
the
visitor
see?
does
the
record
tell
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record,
i
do
not
--
of
course
i
do
not
question
your
statement,
but
does
the
record
tell
us
that
there
was
visiting
before
the
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
tell
us
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
page
does
tell
us
something
about
the
nature
of
the
visiting
rights.
that
tells
us
they
will
be
in
the
barracks
or
in
the
auditorium
rather
than
they
wait
in
the
barracks.
it
implies
that
they
would
not
have
unrestricted
access
to
the
entire
facility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
so,
it
does
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
indicate
there
is
no
physical
contact
between
the
visitor
and
the
inmate.
does
that
mean
they
talk
through
a
glass
window.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
turner,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
difference
between
what
you
claim
your
rights
are
here
and
the
interest
in
finding
out
what
happens
in
governmental
conferences,
whether
there
is
secrecy
and
like
you
said
there
are
two
differences
one
is
there
is
an
absence
of
interest
in
confidentiality
here
and
there
is
an
interest
in
confidentiality
in
these
other
cases,
but
you
never
get
your
second
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
turner
do
you
--
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
question,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
granting
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
question
does
not
ask
about
the
form
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
does
it?
but
whether
or
not
any
injunction
should
have
been
granted?
well
no
granted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
other
side
--
the
relief
requested
by
the
other
side
is
a
vacation
of
the
entire
injunction,
not
a
change
in
its
terms
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
turner
before
you
sit
down
the
record
includes
the
visiting
rules
which
were
in
affect
in
june
of
75,
it
shows
they
were
revised
in
june
of
75.
does
the
record
contain
the
rules
that
were
in
affect
before
the
june
75
revision,
as
i
understand
your
controversy
began
in
march
and
through
may?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
they
are
in
the
record
but
not
the
appendix.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
there
was
no
basis
for
any
injunctive
relief
at
all,
that
is
what
you
are
asking
that
the
injunction
be
entirely
set
aside
or
is
your
claim
one
that
excessive
relief
was
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
the
court
had
been
persuaded
that
at
the
time
the
law
suit
was
brought
there
was
virtually
--
there
was
insufficient
access,
not
quite
zero,
but
close
enough
to
zero
so
that
there
was
a
denial
of
first
amendment
rights
both
to
the
public
and
the
press
and
if
in
arguing
for
preliminarily
injunction
the
press
had
said
at
least
give
us
this
much,
and
he
had
only
granted
relief
to
the
press,
would
that
have
been
constitutional
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
have
cured
that
constitutional
error
by
saying
that
both
the
public
and
the
press
shall
be
entitled
to
the
same
relief
and
then
had
exactly
the
same
relief
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
court
has
never
squarely
answered
the
question,
whether
a
state
may
pursue
a
policy
of
entirely
excluding
both
the
public
and
the
press
from
any
access
to
information
about
prison
conditions.
i
think
that
question
must
be
answered
in
order
to
decide
this
case
properly.
for
reasons
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
have
joined,
we
would
hold
that
such
a
policy
of
total
exclusion
is
unconstitutional
and
we
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
