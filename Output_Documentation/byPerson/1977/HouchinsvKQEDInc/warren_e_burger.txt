we
hear
arguments
next
in

houchins
against
station
kqed.
mr.

you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
rights
of
an
individual
who
walks
in
on
the
day
when
the
press
has
a
scheduled
tour
and
says
i
have
a
camera,
i
am
an
amateur
photographer
and
i
want
to
go
along.
do
you
think
the
sheriff
can
exclude
that
private
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
is
a
matter
of
prison
or
jail
administration,
the
director
or
sheriff
could
say,
it
is
more
convenient
to
keep
these
two
categories
separate,
that
is
we
will
have
general
public
visitation
on
the
first
monday
in
every
months
and
we
will
have
media
representatives
on
the
second
monday
of
every
month.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
an
administrative
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
constitutional
question
involved
in
that
kind
of
a
decision
or
is
that
just
routine
administration
of
the
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
he
gives
the
media
precisely
and
exactly
the
same
access
as
the
public,
do
you
think
there
is
any
constitutional
problem
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
part
of
the
constitution
do
you
draw
on
to
say
that
there
is
a
right
to
access
to
take
pictures
and
do
these
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
suppose
the
president
decides
to
have
cabinet
meetings
open
to
the
media
with
television
and
all
the
other
instance.
does
that
mean
that
the
court's
have
to
open
their
conferences
because
someone
else
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
what
significance
is
it
that
some
other
prisons
in
this
area
have
different
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
president
opens
the
cabinet
meetings
to
tv,
then
how
could
united
states
court
of
appeals
or
court
of
claims
have
a
justifiable
reason
for
excluding
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
suppose
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
all
decide
to
open
their
conferences
to
television.
does
that
mean
all
other
courts
have
got
to
do
it?
they
are
engaged
in
the
same
kind
of
a
decisional
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
someone
else
does
is
really
not
very
relevant.
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
if
the
old
fashioned
system
that
existed
at
least
a
century
ago
of
having
boards
of
visitation
reported
semi-annually
or
quarterly
to
the
local
governing
body,
were
created
and
you
had
six
citizens
designated
by
the
mayor
or
by
the
court
or
by
someone
who
made
these
visits
regularly
and
reported
publicly.
would
you
say
that
would
satisfy
the
publics
right
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
put
any
limit
on
it
and
indeed
at
times
beginning
with
the
colonial
days
these
boards
of
visitors,
visited
such
institutions,
just
the
way
bank
examiners
do
today,
unannounced.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
read
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
to
prevent
every
prisoner
in
the
institution
whether
a
pretrial
detainee
or
under
a
conviction
from
writing
a
long
long
letter
to
his
wife
or
his
mother
or
his
lawyer
and
having
that
published
in
the
letters
to
the
editor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
united
states
senator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
united
states
senator,
there
are
normally
a
hundred
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
435
members
of
the
house.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
booty
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
court
or
the
district
court
down
in
this
area,
generally
enter
injunctions
without
very
specific
findings
or
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
also
for
announcements,
the
disposition
of
76-1310,
houchins
against
kqed
inc..
since
my
brother
stewart
who
concurs
in
the
judgment
wishes
to
announce
and
explain
his
views,
and
my
brother
stevens
joined
by
mr.
justice
powell
who
dissents,
both
of
them
dissenting
wishes
to
view
the
same,
it
would
unfair
on
my
part
to
ask
them
to
explain
my
opinion
for
plurality
of
the
court.
i
will
therefore
go
beyond
my
usual
practice
of
announcing,
only
the
result.
on
its
face,
this
case
involves
a
claim
of
tv
and
newspaper
reporters
to
a
special
right
of
access
to
enter
prison
facilities,
to
take
pictures,
still
pictures
and
motion
pictures
for
publication
and
for
broadcasting.
naturally,
their
chief
interest
is
not
limited
to
the
bars
and
the
cells,
but
the
people,
people
of
course
make
news.
i
should
say
at
the
outset
too,
that
we
have
a
short
course
in
this
case,
since
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision.
in
the
opinion,
which
i
have
filed
for
plurality,
i
trying
to
make
it
clear
that
except
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
prisoners
as
much
as
is
reasonably
possible.
it
is
a
good
thing,
a
very
good
thing
for
the
public
to
understand
more
than
public
does
about
prisons
in
jails
and
the
conditions
in
them.
yet
there
are
some
limits.
the
inmates
of
these
institutions
lose
many
of
their
civil
rights
and
their
right
of
privacy
is
necessarily
limited,
but
they
retain
some
rights.
this
court
has
spoken
often
on
the
right
of
access
of
the
media
to
such
institutions.
back
in
1964,
chief
justice
warren
writing
for
the
court
said
this,
“there
are
few
restrictions
on
action
which
could
not
be
clothed
by
ingenious
arguments
in
the
garb
of
decreased
data
flow”.
for
example,
the
prohibition
of
unauthorized
entry
into
the
white
house
diminishes
the
citizen's
opportunities
to
gather
information
he
might
find
relevant
to
his
opinion
on
the
way
the
country
is
being
run,
but
that
does
not
make
entry
into
the
white
house
a
first
amendment
right.
the
right
to
speak
and
publish
does
not
carry
with
it
the
unrestrained
right
to
gather
information."
more
recently,
in
the
court's
opinion
in
branzburg
against
hayes,
the
court
stated,
the
first
amendment
does
not
guarantee
the
press,
a
constitutional
right
of
special
access
to
information
not
available
to
the
public
generally.
and
at
a
later
point
in
the
opinion,
the
court
stated,
newsmen
and
here
we
should
watch
our
language
more
carefully,
and
we
should
say
newspersons
have
no
constitutional
right
of
access
to
the
scenes
of
a
crime
or
a
disaster
when
the
general
public
is
excluded.
in
pell
against
procunier
and
saxbe
against
washington
post,
the
court
declared
explicitly
and
without
reservation
essentially
that
the
media
have
no
constitutional
right
of
access
to
prisons
or
their
inmates
beyond
that
afforded
for
the
general
public.
but
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
emphasize
what
to
me
is
the
real
issue,
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
it
is
neither
the
claim
of
the
media
to
enter
and
take
pictures
for
publication
and
broadcast
or
interviewing
the
inmates,
nor
is
it
the
question
of
bringing
prison
conditions
out
in
to
the
open.
anyone
can
visit
prisons
and
write
or
speak
about
what
they
see,
anyone
can
interview
former
inmates,
their
families
and
their
lawyers.
the
basic
and
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
who
shall
decide
what
the
access
is
to
be?
who
shall
decide
what
rights
the
media
should
have?
and
just
as
in
the
recent
snail
darter
case,
where
i
thought
and
there
was
majority
of
the
court
agreed
that
the
real
issue
was
not
what
was
sensible
and
what
was
sound
and
what
was
good
and
what
was
desirable,
but
whether
congress
or
judges
should
make
the
decision?
so
here,
although
i
strongly
favor
maximum
public
information
about
prisons,
i
agree
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
hold
clearly
and
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
right
of
access
is
not
a
constitutional
matter,
but
one
policy
for
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branches.
congress,
some
years
ago
passed
the
freedom
of
information
act
opening
a
great
deal
of
governmental
information
to
the
public.
it
can
do
much
the
same
for
prisons
and
state
legislatures
can
do
likewise.
i
am
intended
to
my
brother
stewart
for
an
article
which
he
published
in
a
law
journal
sometime
ago
on
this
subject.
there
he
said
that
“the
first
amendment
is
neither
a
freedom
of
information
act,
nor
an
official
secrets
act.”
even
i
don't
want
to
say
that
the
guarantees
or
freedom
of
the
press
and
these
were
his
words,
end
of
speech
“established
the
context
for
information,
not
its
resolution,
for
the
rest,”
he
continued,
“we
must
rely
as
so
often
in
our
system
on
the
tug
and
pull
of
the
political
forces
in
american
society.
grand
juries,
prosecutors,
legislative
committees
can
enter
prisons
and
jails
without
limit
to
investigate
conditions
and
if
they
do
so
and
fail
to
report
those
conditions
to
the
public,
i
suggest
that
the
power
of
the
media
to
compel
disclosure
in
those
circumstances
is
virtually
--
would
be
virtually
irresistible.”
in
this
case
they
seek
to
have
the
court,
this
court,
to
write
a
freedom
of
information
act,
something
that
justice
stewart
wisely
said
should
be
left
to
repeat
his
words,
to
the
tug
and
pull
of
the
political
forces,
that
is
say
to
the
legislative
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stevens.
