mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is,
must
the
sheriff
give
greater
access
to
his
county
jail
facility
to
the
media
than
he
gives
to
the
public?
the
purpose
of
the
access
in
this
case
is
to
gather
information.
the
district
court
in
this
case
required
that
certain
access
be
given
to
the
media.
there
was
no
requirement
that
similar
access
be
given
to
the
public
and
there
was
no
determination
by
the
district
court
that
the
public
access
was
inadequate
in
any
way.
the
required
media
access
is
as
i
say
greater
than
the
sheriff
gives
to
the
public.
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
with
the
court
what
that
public
access
is.
first
of
all
it
is
mail,
access
by
mail,
there
is
no
censorship,
letters
are
not
read.
they
are
subject
to
inspection
only.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
all
of
the
access
that
i
am
discussing
except
for
the
public
tours
had
in
fact
started
when
the
proceeding
started.
so
i
will
answer
your
honor's
question
in
that
way.
the
mail
was
there
at
the
time
the
proceeding
started,
as
i
say
it
was
–
if
the
inmate
lacked
cash
to
pay
for
stamps
or
postage
or
anything
like
that,
that
was
provided.
secondly
at
the
time
the
proceeding
started
and
after
there
is
visiting,
ample
visiting.
it
is
unquestioned
that
it
is
ample
there
are
no
categories
of
persons
who
may
visit.
they
need
not
be
members
of
the
family
or
anything
else.
anyone
including
a
reporter
could
visit.
there
are
some
restrictions
on
those
who
have
been
in
prison
or
those
who
are
under18,
the
prison
restriction
stems
from
provisions
in
the
california
penal
code.
again
at
the
time
the
proceeding
started
there
was
access
by
telephones
for
those
who
were
in
the
maximum
security
facility.
there
was
telephone
access
on
a
collect
basis
to
anyone.
the
phone
lines
did
not
go
through
the
sheriff's
department
in
anyway
they
went
right
to
the
telephone
company.
so
there
was
no
monitoring,
no
capacity
for
us
to
find
out
who
was
called?
what
was
said,
nothing
totally
open
telephones.
other
than
in
the
maximum
security
facility
telephone
access
was
through
the
correctional
services
or
officers.
again
mr.
justice
stevens
at
the
time
the
proceeding
started
there
were
interviews
with
pretrial
detainees
available.
those
could
be
done,
in
fact
they
would
have
been
done
typically
off
the
premises.
those
could
have
been
photographed,
tape
recorded.
they
would
be
private;
no
one
from
the
sheriff's
department
would
be
there.
the
requirement
there
is
that
consents
previously
be
obtained
from
the
inmate
himself,
from
his
counsel,
from
the
district
attorney
and
from
the
court
having
jurisdiction
over
the
trial.
what
was
not
present
at
the
time
the
proceedings
commenced
were
the
tours.
however
as
i
believe,
it
is
in
appendix
page
10
--
beg
your
pardon
page
19
of
the
appendix.
i
am
reading
from
the
affidavit
of
mr.
turner
who
was
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
then
and
now
as
on
june
10
a
week
before
the
proceedings
were
filed,
he
spoke
again
with
me
and
i
told
him
about
the
tour.
so
for
the
situation,
at
the
time
the
proceedings
commenced
was
that
the
tours
were
planed
and
scheduled
and
it
was
well
known
to
everyone
including
these
plaintiffs,
that
they
in
fact
would
begin.
it
is
true
that
they
had
not
in
fact
begun.
it
was
necessary
for
the
sheriff
to
secure
funding
from
the
board
of
supervisors,
he
had
to
go
--
in
a
bureaucracy
those
things
take
time,
unfortunately
we
cannot
just
spring
to
action.
the
tours
cover
as
the
record
shows
virtually
the
entire
facility,
there
is
no
screening
of
any
visitors.
it
is
--
the
record
indicates
that
many
of
the
places
are
just
taken
by
ordinary
citizens,
people
who
have
a
curiosity
about
what
is
going
on
in
the
jail.
the
tour
does
not
see
any
inmates,
no
inmates
are
--
i
better
be
specific
on
that,
you
certainly
might
see
them
you
do
not
talk
to
them,
there
is
no
communication
between
inmates
and
the
members
of
the
tour.
the
tours
at
that
time
were
25
persons,
they
are
now
approximately
30
and
there
is
only
four
guards
so
plainly,
conversation
between
inmates
and
in
visitors
is
impossible.
no
cameras
are
permitted
on
the
tours
and
no
tape
recorders
are
permitted
on
the
tours.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
they
had
at
the
commencement
of
the
tours
your
honor,
better
access
than
anyone
else
because
the
announcement
of
the
tours
was
made
through
the
media.
it
was
in
fact
a
suggestion
by
some
of
the
members
of
the
board,
the
supervisors
that
the
first
tour
should
be
set
aside
entirely
for
the
media
and
the
discussion
–
that
suggestion
was
rejected
on
the
grounds
that
if
they
wanted
to
go,
they
knew
about
it
before
anyone
else
and
so
all
they
had
to
do
was
file
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
exactly,
they
were
and
are.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
they
became,
the
first
six
months
of
the
tours
became
booked
very
quickly,
quite
possibly
before
the
end
of
july,
the
first
tour
was
on
july
14,
1975
and
probably
before
i
do
not
remember,
my
recollection
your
honor
is
that
before
the
end
of
july
the
tours
had
been
booked.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
that
is
correct,
he
could
not
have
gone
on
one
of
tours,
that
of
course
is
not
the
only
means
of
access
your
honor.
had
there
been
an
occurrence
in
the
jail
indeed
before
the
tours
ever
started,
the
media
can
and
does
have
alternate
means
of
finding
out
what
is
going
on,
by
means
of
interviews,
i
have
not
completed
the
access
that
is
now
and
was
then
available
to
the
media.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
to
the
public.
this
was
all
--
this
is
what
became
available
to
the
public;
the
media
has
then
and
now
greater
access
than
the
public.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
i
might
have
misspeak.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
exactly.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes,
it
would,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
in
the
case
your
honor
to
indicate
any
alternative
means
to
these
and
as
i
say
i
am
not
finished,
but
this
media
or
pardon
me
this
access
package
taken
as
a
whole
is
the
entire
package.
so
if
there
had
been
a
riot
or
a
fire
or
something
like
that,
then
the
means
of
access
for
the
media
are
through
alternative
means
such
as
interviews
or
something
of
that
nature
with
participants.
not
the
capacity
to
go
in
with
their
cameras,
at
least
on
demand,
there
is
one,
i
do
want
to
get
into
one
specific
media
access
that
the
media
alone
has
and
that
is
special
tours
with
the
cameras
and
with
tapes
on
a
scheduled
basis,
that
is
critical,
not
on
demand,
but
on
a
scheduled
basis
there
is
no
fix
schedule,
whatever
schedule
the
district
court
had
in
mind
and
as
the
keys
turned
out
there
was
no
schedule
propagated,
but
this
sheriff
is
still
willing
to
do
that,
that
is
part
of
it,
of
course
finally
the
release
bus
to
contact
inmates.
alright
that
completes
your
honors
the
access
that
exists.
the
complaint
of
kqed
with
respect
to
this,
is
that
there
is
no
random
interviews
on
the
tours,
that
no
inmates
are
on
view
for
their
cameras
in
cells
or
barracks
or
eating
for
televising
and
that
there
is
no
access
on
demand
for
their
equipment.
as
i
have
just
indicated
there
is
access
with
their
equipment
on
a
schedule
basis,
but
not
on
demand.
the
district
court
did
not
make
any
finding
of
any
intention
to
conceal
conditions
in
the
jail,
but
nevertheless,
the
district
court
made
its
injunction
which
requires
the
sheriff
to
allow
what
it
called
full
and
accurate
news
coverage
and
specifically
required
the
sheriff
to
permit
random
interviews
on
the
tours
and
to
permit
the
use
of
cameras
and
tapes
and
plainly
not
on
the
schedule
tour,
but
on
a
demand
tour.
the
only
exception
stated
in
the
district
court's
memorandum
and
injunction
was
that
when
tensions
in
fact
existed
the
sheriff
could
put
a
stop
to
it,
stop
to
the
access.
in
fact
the
district
court
virtually
invited
litigation
on
the
point
because
it
says,
if
anybody
thinks
there
really
is
no
tension
they
can
come
in
and
we
will
have
a
hearing
on
that.
so
what
the
district
court
did
then
is
it
balanced
the
asserted
media
needs
against
the
sheriff's
public
access
program.
there
was
no
balancing
by
the
district
court
of
the
public's
rights
in
anyway.
the
district
court
did
not
address
the
public
rights
in
anyway.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes,
i
think
i
am.
i
think
the
public
does
have
some
rights
of
access.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
he
is.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
well.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
well
it
is
not
entirely
clear.
in
the
pell
case
what
the
court
did
as
i
as
i
read
it
any
case
is,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
intention
to
conceal
any
conditions.
the
court
found
that
there
was
public
access
and
that
was
enough,
those
two
factors,
there
was
plainly
no
--
nothing
being
swept
under
the
rug,
nothing
being
hidden.
at
least
the
court
determined
that
the
public
access
was
there
adequate,
that
was
the
statement
of
the
court.
now
i
appreciate
and
the
reason
i
hesitate
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
appreciate
that
the
public
access
in
that
case
was
not
strictly
speaking
an
issue
just
as
it
was
not
placed
an
issue
here.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
said.
but
i
do
not
read
the
decision
they
are
saying
that
means
necessarily
that
the
public
access
is
zero.
that
is
not
resolved
in
any
decision
that
this
court
that
i
am
aware
of.
it
was
not
placed
an
issue
in
that
case.
that
is
my
point.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
certainly
not.
that
is
not.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
well
that
is
not
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
it
is
a
logical
position
your
honors,
but
it
is
not
our
position
that
there
is
no
--
i
am
not
convinced
and
considering
the
body
that
i
am
speaking
to,
i
am
convinced,
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
pell.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
absolutely.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
well,
i
--
that
is
exactly
my
position
too
your
honor.
it
was
not
dealt
with.
court
did
not
have
to
deal
with
it
and
i
have
been
asked,
did
it
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
did.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
no,
i
am
not
urging
that.
that
is
not
our
position,
the
first
place
your
honor,
that
is
not
--
with
respect,
that
is
not
before
you,
it
was
not
tried
in
the
district
court.
we
urged
that,
that
was
the
issue.
our
position
of
the
district
court
was
the
extend
of
the
public
access
should
be
measured
and
that
of
course
that
automatically
if
you
will,
sets
the
media's
access
rights.
but,
that
was
not
what
was
tried
and
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
did.
kqed's
position
in
the
district
court
which
the
district
court
adopted
was
that,
we
have
to
have
special
things
for
the
media,
we
tried
it
as
a
media
access
case,
not
a
public
access
case.
i
want
to
emphasize
one
other
thing.
access,
if
you
read
the
district
court's
opinion
it
is
mainly
something
about
tours.
access
is
more
than
tours,
access
is
visitation,
access
is
mails,
this
court
has
said
some
strong
things
about
mail
rights
in
prisons
for
instance
in
procunier
versus
martinez,
the
court
said,
you
cannot
do
censoring
without
a
lot
of
due
process,
protections.
there
may
well
be
a
right
to
have
visits.
particularly
if
as
we
are
per
county
jail
half
of
our
inmates
are
pretrial
detainees,
they
have
special
rights
which
might
not
appertain
to
an
entirely
convict
population.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
no,
the
record
does
not
tell
you.
as
i
recall
it,
the
visiting
is
in
--
well,
i
do
not
want
to
go
outside
the
record.
it
does
not
tell
you.
it
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
tour.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
oh
yes,
it
does.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes,
it
does
tell
you
that
your
honor.
in
the
--
for
instance,
in
appendix
page
41
and
i
believe,
this
is
dealing
with
the
minimum
security
inmates,
who
are
visiting
only
on
sundays,
there
is
greater
visiting
for
the
pretrial
detainees.
we
were
under
some
orders
from
the
district
court.
different
judge,
judge
(inaudible)
on
visiting
in
so
we
have
greater
visiting
for
pretrial
detainees.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
i
perhaps
misunderstood
the
court's
question.
it
isn't
expanded
on
any
more
than
this.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
in
the
maximum
security
facility
that
is
the
case
at
present
and
then,
it
is
not
indicated
here,
it
is
my
understanding
there
is
not
glass
and
telephones
and
this
is
across
the
table.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
so,
it
seems
to
me
we
come
now
to
what
i
consider
real
legal
issue,
which
is
in
a
situation
where
the
adequacy
of
the
public
rights,
the
access
are
unchallenged.
there
is
no
determination
of
any
intention
to
conceal,
must
the
sheriff
give
access
rights
greater
to
the
media
than
he
gives
to
the
public
and
we
have
in
our
briefs
cited
the
court's
cases
back
approximately
20
years.
all
with
the
same
effect
which
is
that
the
press
has
no
greater
rights
to
than
does
the
public
to
gather
information,
we
are
talking
about
access
rights.
the
two
latest
cases
from
this
court
which
in
our
view
are
controlling
are
pell
case
and
the
saxbe
to
which
we
have
referred
and
the
issue
in
each
case
there
was,
did
interviews
by
the
media
with
specifically
named
inmates
have
to
be
granted,
when
it
was
not
available
to
the
general
public
and
the
court
held
that
in
each
case
they
did
not.
court
applied
the
general
rule
of
which
we
have
stated,
which
is
the
press
has
no
greater
rights.
since
the
public
did
not
have
the
right
to
interview
specifically
named
inmates;
press
need
not
be
given
it
either.
now
it
is
true,
then
in
both
case
the
media
had
greater
access
than
did
the
public.
they
had
the
right
to
interview
those
encounter
randomly
on
of
course
the
tours
for
instance
and
from
this
kqed
argues
that
because
this
greater
media
access
in
fact
existed
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
compelled,
but
when
that
greater
media
access
was
not
an
issue
and
it
was
not
it
was
merely
an
existing
situation.
there
was
not
any
controversy
about
it,
it
was
not
placed
an
issue
by
any
litigant.
there
was
nothing
to
decide,
nothing
to
resolve
and
hence
in
our
view
there
is
no
such
holding
as
contended
by
kqed.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
he
does
and
has
in
two
respects
your
honor.
he
gives
the
press
tours
with
their
cameras
and
with
their
tape
recorders
on
a
schedule
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i
did
not
say
--
i
might
have,
but
i
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
i
do
not
mean
that
if
i
said
that.
it
is
not
critical--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
it
is
uncritical.
it
is
a
fact
that
he
--
just
as
in
pell
and
saxbe
it
was
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
that
would
have
been
denied.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes,
that
is
right.
no,
well
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
right.
that
was
the
sheriff's
policy,
the
sheriff's
policy
is
that
this
is
something
specially
for
the
media.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
i
will
find
it.
i
will
resume
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
a
couple
of
points
only.
the
court
has
asked
some
questions
about
visiting.
it
is
true
that
if
you
happen
to
know
any
inmate,
you
may
visit
him.
any
prisoner
could
write
to
any
member
of
the
press
or
could
telephone
him
and
ask
him
to
come
over
on
a
sunday
or
if
he
is
a
pretrial
detainee
on
tuesday,
wednesday
or
thursday,
for
that
matter.
we
are
talking
about
consents,
the
requirement
of
consents,
why
does
the
sheriff
require
consents
from
all
attorneys
and
the
courts.
it
seems
that
the
likelihood
of
harm
from
an
interview
with
a
pretrial
detainee
is
to
the
detainee
himself
and
it
is
the
sheriff's
view
that
he
should,
he
would
rather
stay
out
of
that
and
have
the
parties
and
the
attorneys
and
the
courts
who
are
responsible,
decide
whether
an
interview
with
filming
and
with
recorders
is
to
be
permitted
or
not.
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
access
where
the
public
in
our
case
is
greater
than
the
public
access
was
in
pell,
for
instance,
in
pell
the
mail
access
was
subject
to
censoring
with
appropriate
due
process
protections.
in
our
case
the
mail
is
totally
uncensored.
in
pell
the
visits
were
limited
to
certain
groups
of
persons,
in
our
case
the
visits
are
not
limited.
in
pell
the
public
access
tour
did
not
cover
the
entire
facility,
it
did
not
cover
the
maximum
security
area
for
instance,
there
was
a
one
year
wait,
you
saw
no
inmates
and
took
no
cameras.
in
our
case
you
do
see
all
of
the
facility.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
no
that
is
except
a
little
greystone
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
except
for
little
greystone,
little
greystone
your
honor
is
a
barracks
facility,
other
barracks
facilities
are
seen
there,
identical.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
there
is
that
exception,
incidentally
mr.
justice
white
you
asked
for
the
reference,
it
is
in
our
brief
at
page
11.
this
is
the
scheduled
tours
for
the
media
and
in
there
is
the
reference
to
the
record
where
that
is
displayed.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
the
district
court's
memorandum
has
the
only
findings
and
that
is
directed
almost
entirely
to
a
critic
of
the
public
tours
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
reporter.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
there
are
no
findings.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
that
is
correct,
in
that
respect
i
am
afraid
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
in
the
record
your
honor,
it
is
page
11
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
i
--
this
district
court
your
honor?
i
have
had
no
previous
experience
with
the
late
chief
judge
and
so
i
really
cannot
speak
to
that.
i
think
that
is
substantially
completes
my
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
it
is
our
claim
that
under
the
district
court's
approach
no
injunction
was
proper.
if
someone
had
tried
to
establish
and
it
should
be
noted
that
there
were
private
persons
as
parties
in
this
case
who
did
not
testify
the
naacp
plaintiffs.
if
those
as
representatives
of
the
public
had
challenged
our
public
access
program,
then
it
is
possible
that
some,
that
the
district
court
could
have
determined
properly
or
improperly,
i
do
not
know,
but
could
have
determined
that
the
public
access
program
was
adequate
or
not.
that
was
never
done
and
so
i
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
it
would
in
my
opinion.
the
error
is
that
as
i
understand
the
holding
of
this
court
in
pell
and
saxbe,
you
cannot,
you
need
not
give
the
press
greater
access
than
the
public
--
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
it
would
have
cured
that
odd
error,
it
would
not
have
cured
the
other
error
of
whether
or
not
any
access
whatever
is
required.
that
is
a
different
issue
which
was
of
course
never
reached
your
honor.
mr.
kelvin
h.
booty,
jr.
yes
i
do.
thank
you
your
honor.
