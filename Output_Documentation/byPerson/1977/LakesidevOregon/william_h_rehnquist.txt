justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
my
brother
marshall's
question,
supposing
the
judge
at
the
close
of
trial
said,
“i
am
going
to
give
an
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
and
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
a
presumption
of
innocence
and
his
counsel
objected
to
be
giving
a
bad
instruction,”
would
you
be
making
the
same
point
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
are
not
analogous,
why
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
doubt
is
there
that
the
judge
is
charged
was
a
correct
statement
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
oregon
the
judges
have
to
be
right
in
the
obligation
to
charge
juries
as
to
the
law
governing
their
deliberations
in
a
particular
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
judge
in
precisely
the
situation
that
as
circuit
court
judge
was
here
and
presented
with
your
client’s
attorney’s
objection
to
giving
his
instruction
and
said
i
know
that
there
will
be
a
claim
of
constitutional
violation
if
i
do
not
give
the
instruction,
if
i
do
give
the
instruction,
the
claim
that
you
are
now
making
here,
i
fear
if
i
do
not
give
it
up
your
plan
of
incompetent
assistance
of
counsel?
