mr.
margolin,
what
does
your
constitutional
rights
talk.
suppose
your
man
who
did
take
the
stand
and
testified,
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right
to
request
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
he
did
not
have
to
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
tough
question?
unknown
speaker
it
settles
the
law
that
he
waives
the
right
by
taking
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
they
ask
for
it,
but
have
you
not
waived
any
constitutional
right
by
not
getting
on
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
by
getting
obviously?
unknown
speaker
it
is
sure
he
did
not
waive
here
though,
he
did
not
--
unknown
speaker
but
question
whether
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
claim
some
benefit
of
the
privilege
not
to
testify
when
you
are
going
ahead
and
testify?
unknown
speaker
you
speak
of
fifth
amendment
providing
that
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
take
the
stand
and
i
realize
that
griffin
in
reached
that
conclusion
under
the
facts
in
that
case.
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
in
terms
of
compulsion.
where
is
the
compulsion
here?
you
have
a
neutral
instruction.
unknown
speaker
in
griffin
as
i
recall
not
only
did
the
prosecutor
make
some
reference
to
the
bailiff
to
take
the
stand,
but
the
judge
himself
told
the
jury
that
it
could
consider
that
fact?
unknown
speaker
that
was
far
from
being
neutral
by
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
just
like
--
your
position
is
that
there
is
compulsion
either
to
mention
or
not
mention
that
this
constitutional
right
have
a
neutral
air
to
mention
may
be?
unknown
speaker
compulsion?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
fifth
amendment
says.
it
speaks
intent
of
compelling
a
witness
to
give
evidence
against
themselves?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
margolin
is
that
really
the
whole
analysis
in
griffin?
is
it
not
the
point
that
if
a
defendant
before
he
makes
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
testify,
knows
in
advance
that
this
kind
of
comment
will
be
made
by
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor,
there
is
a
form
of
compulsion
that
influences
his
choice
and
is
it
the
same
true
here
if
he
knows
he
does
not
have
any
choice
on
whether
the
instruction
is
made,
he
knows
in
advance
that
instruction
he
does
not
want
here
will
be
given,
that
has
some
influence
on
his
choice
and
there
is
at
least
a
modest
form
of
compulsion
--
unknown
speaker
may
be
its
not
as
strong
as
saying
here
is
a
subpoena
to
get
on
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
not
influence
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
take
a
stand
if
you
know
what
kind
of
instructions
can
we
get?
unknown
speaker
one
a
judge
might
give
one
kind
and
another,
another?
unknown
speaker
mr.
margolin,
perhaps
you
have
answered
this,
but
you
have
raised
a
sixth
amendment
question
too,
have
you
not?
unknown
speaker
was
this
raised
below?
unknown
speaker
certainly
the
supreme
court
did
not
mention
it,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
denney
i
suppose
the
issue
is
who
should
make
the
decision,
the
defendant,
his
lawyer
or
the
judge
and
suppose
the
judge
concludes
after
hearing
all
the
facts
you
have
described
that
the
defendant
would
really
be
much
better
off
if
he
took
the
witness
stand
in
order
to
explain
all
the
things,
he
can
make
him
it,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
in
this
area,
it
is
up
to
the
defendant
to
decide
for
himself
whether
to
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
now,
why
should
he
not
also
decide
from
himself
whether
he
wants
his
instruction
or
not?
he
may
be
wrong,
he
may
be
wrong
about
not
getting
on
the
stand
too?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
question
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
what
the
law
is
in
this
case?
must
the
judge
or
must
he
not
give
the
instruction
over
the
role
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
you
have
been
asked
what
the
state’s
interest
is?
does
it
not
--
is
it
not
primary
interest
of
a
fair
trial?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
question
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
does
not
the
judge
have
responsibility
for
instructing
a
jury
as
to
what
the
law
of
the
state
is?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
defendant
questioned
the
judge
to
give
no
instructions
whatever
on
his
behalf?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
judge
would
be
justified
in
sending
a
case
to
the
jury
with
no
instructions
as
to
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
that
would
be
in
the
hypothetical
case
put
to
you
earlier
in
the
argument
by
my
brother
rehnquist.
what
if
a
defendant’s
lawyer
affirmatively
requested
the
trial
judge
not
to
charge,
not
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
duty
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
guilty
on
a
reasonable
doubt
and
you
have
already
said
that
please
do
not
instruct
the
jury
on
that
subject
and
the
judge
said,
“okay
you
are
the
lawyer,
you
are
the
boss.”
so
he
did
not,
that
would
be,
would
that
not
be
--
would
that
be
a
valid
conviction?
unknown
speaker
yes,
let
us
assume
that
the
lawyer
was
a
member
of
the
bar
and
he
was
not
a
phony
and
he
was
validly
representing
this
client
and
he
thought
for
some
strange
reason
that
it
would
hurt
his
client
to
have
that
instruction
given?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
difference
between
that
case
as
you
pointed
just
a
strange
reason
could
motivate
that
request,
but
the
request
involved
here
as
a
substantial
number
of
state
supreme
court
think
its
a
very
sensible
request?
unknown
speaker
it
is
hard
to
say
that
that
is
malpractice,
to
give
the
examples
mr.
justice
stewart
gives
it
is
only
a
strange
request?
unless
away
from
malpractice,
suppose
that
he
were
representing
himself
as
this
court
did
its
charitable
approaches
who
said
they
have
a
right
to
do
and
he
made
this
request?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
going
get
away
from
any
malpractice
claim
or
any
incompetency
claim?
