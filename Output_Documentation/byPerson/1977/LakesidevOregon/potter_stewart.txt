justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
the
petitioner
ensio
ruben
lakeside
was
brought
to
trial
in
an
oregon
court
on
a
criminal
charge.
four
witnesses
testified
from
the
defense
s
but
the
petitioner
himself
did
not
take
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf.
over
the
objection
of
his
counsel,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
defendant
has
an
option
whether
or
not
to
testify
and
that
no
adverse
inferences
of
any
kind
were
to
be
drawn
from
the
petitioners
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
giving
of
such
a
cautionary
instruction
over
the
objection
of
defense
council
violates
the
constitution.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
believing
that
a
trial
judge
should
not
give
this
cautionary
instruction
when
defense
council
objects,
reversed
the
petitioner's
conviction
and
ordered
a
new
trial.
but
the
oregon
supreme
court
reinstated
the
conviction
holding
that
the
giving
of
instruction
over
the
objection
of
counsel
did
not
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant.
because
of
conflicting
decisions
in
several
other
courts,
we
granted
certiorari.
it
is
an
established
rule
in
oregon
as
it
is
in
the
federal
judicial
system
that
the
kind
of
instruction
given
in
this
case
must
be
given
if
the
defendant
requests
it.
the
petitioner
does
not
question
this
rule,
and
orders
the
assert
that
the
language
of
the
instruction
actually
given
was
in
any
respect
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
law.
his
argument
is
quite
simply
that
this
protective
instruction
becomes
constitutionally
impermissible
when
given
over
the
defendant's
objection.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
giving
of
this
cautionary
instruction
over
the
defendant's
objection
does
not
violate
either
the
constitutional
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
or
the
constitutional
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
is
affirmed,
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
most
of
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
