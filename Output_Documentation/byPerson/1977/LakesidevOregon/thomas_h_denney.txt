mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
like
mr.
margolin,
i
think
my
argument
will
not
be
a
lengthy
one,
but
i
would
like
to
start
it
since
mr.
margolin
spoke
a
little
about
the
nature
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
flush
out
the
actual
facts
that
came
out
on
the
trial
and
that
were
developed
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
i
do
this
if
for
no
other
reason
not
because
i
am
questioning
mr.
margolin’s
specific
trial
strategy
in
this
case,
but
to
illustrate
that
reasonable
men
at
least
could
differ
as
to
whether
or
not
an
instruction
not
to
draw
an
inference
to
take
from
the
defendants
failure
to
testify
which
is
proper
in
this
case
and
that
in
any
case
the
judge’s
action
in
doing
so
was
not
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
one.
in
addition,
perhaps
the
facts
themselves
as
they
were
developed
in
this
case,
and
they
are
not
in
the
any
of
the
credit
portions
of
the
record
that
the
court
has,
but
they
are
in
the
record
which
was
transmitted.
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
the
defendant
lakeside
does
have
quite
a
background
of
an
unhappy
family
history.
he
was
a
heroin
addict
and
an
alcoholic.
he
had
a
prior
conviction
of
attempted
murder,
dating
from
about
1972.
he
was
sent
to
the
oregon
state
penitentiary,
paroled
after
about
nine
months,
violated
his
parole
and
was
returned
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
seems
to
be
the
argument,
but
the
fact
is
it
all
came
out.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
am
not
flaunting
at
around
improperly
mr.
justice
marshall
i
believe
because
my
point
is
the
jury
heard
all
of
this.
all
of
this
came
in
the
testimony
of
the
state
psychiatrist,
one
dr.
kolbeck
who
told
the
jury
all
of
this.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
that
is
my
point.
he
was
then
charged
in
about
april
1975
with
the
convictions
that
led
to
his
incarceration
from
which
he
escaped.
there
were
charges
of
disorderly
conduct,
theft
in
the
second
degree,
criminal
mischief
and
harassment,
all
of
them
misdemeanors
under
oregon
law.
they
rose
out
of
three
separate
incidences
and
alcohol
was
involved
in
at
least
one
of
these
cases.
as
a
result
of
a
plea
bargain
negotiated
between
the
district
attorney
and
the
public
defender
of
portland
who
was
representing
mr.
lakeside
at
the
time,
the
agreement
was
that
lakeside
would
plead
guilty
to
three
of
these
charges,
the
fourth
one
the
harassment
charge
was
dismissed.
he
would
be
placed
in
the
multnomah
county
correctional
institution
which
is
a
minimum
security
place,
primarily
for
work
release
people
rather
than
being
sent
to
the
maximum
facility
for
misdemeanance
in
multnomah
county,
oregon,
that
is
the
rocky
butte
jail.
he
expressed
all
and
the
other
and
this
was
the
important
part
of
the
condition
as
far
as
lakeside
was
concerned
in
his
theory
of
the
case
was
that
he
would
be
required
to
take
anti-abuse
for
his
alcohol
problem
while
he
was
in
the
correctional
institute.
he
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
do
so
as
he
told
his
counsel
at
the
time
because
he
had
been
made
sick
by
having
taken
anti-abuse
before,
at
least
that
was
what
he
told
his
counsel.
anyway
he
was
received
in
multnomah
county
correctional
institute
on
may
09,
1975.
he
started
on
anti-abuse
on
may
21.
he
received
some
five
or
six
dosages
of
it,
the
last
being
on
june
15.
on
june
16,
he
was
given
a
sign
out
pass
from
6.00
a.m.
on
june
16,
to
terminate
at
10.00
p.m.
on
june
17
and
he
did
not
return
from
this
sign
out
pass
and
under
oregon
law
failing
to
return
from
a
release
or
from
a
temporary
leave
situation
constitutes
an
escape.
efforts
were
made
to
locate
him
and
on
the
june
23,
the
defendant’s
mother
called
the
police,
they
said,
he
was
at
home
and
the
police
went
and
found
him
passed
out
and
very
drunk
and
they
returned
him
to
the
institution
rather
and
that
facts
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
this
is
all
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
it
was
all
brought
up,
all
of
that
i
have
said
so
far
was
brought
up
in
the
prosecution’s
case.
the
defense
as
i
have
said
did
go
to
a
mental
disease
or
defect
also
attempting
to
make
some
use
of
the
fact
that
this
was
aggravated
by
the
use
of
anti-abuse.
and
the
real
dispute
of
fact
that
occurs
i
think
in
the
whole
case
was
whether
or
not
the
anti-abuse
really
did
indeed
make
him
sick
or
whether
it
was
a
combination
of
alcohol
and
the
anti-abuse
which
led
to
the
condition
that
was
observed.
the
two
guards
at
least
at
the
correctional
institute
said
that
he
never
complained
to
them
about
having
any
reaction
from
the
anti-abuse,
even
though
it
was
administered
to
him
several
times.
his
mother
and
his
sister
testified
in
his
behalf
that
he
complained
to
them
constantly
about
the
reactions
he
was
having
from
the
anti-abuse
while
taking
his
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
insisting
on
overriding
trial
strategy.
i
am
saying
that
the
trial
court
could
reasonably
have
concluded
the
instruction
was
proper
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place
as
mr.
justice
marshall
was
asking
and
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out,
his
prior
criminal
record
came
out
anyway
so
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
you
say
he
kept
off
to
stand
not
to
get
the
criminal
record
before
the
jury.
there
was
an
insanity
defense
in
this
and
while
reasonable
minds
can
differ
on
this
point
too,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
an
insanity
defense
normally,
you
as
defense
counsel
would
want
the
jury
to
see
your
client
and
evaluate
him,
if
there
is
any
merit
to
the
insanity
defense
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no,
of
course
he
cannot
make
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand
sir?
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
that
is
the
argument
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
oh!
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
those
of
the
two
countervailing
factors
i
suppose
on
who
actually
makes
the
choice
in
this.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
that
is
the
question
before
this
court.
we
talked
about
two
of
the
factors
that
are
involved
in
making
that
decision.
another
is
the
question
i
think
at
least,
and
these
are
the
points
that
i
have
made
in
the
brief,
if
this
is
as
mr.
justice
powell
said
a
neutral
instruction
and
we
submit
that
it
is,
where
is
the
possibility
of
the
instruction
having
been
given
for
reasons
determined
by
the
trial
judge,
where
is
the
possibility
of
harm.
one
answer
of
this
and
i
set
it
up
as
straw
man
in
my
argument
of
course,
is
to
say
that
you
have
to
assume
that
telling
a
jury
not
to
do
something
means
that
they
may
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
argument
that
should
not
be
spelled
by
this
court
because
it
is
not
a
good
idea
and
it
is
contrary
i
think
to
our
basic
notion
of
what
a
jury
system
is
all
about
to
assume
that
the
jurors
are
incapable
of
following
such
instruction.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
state
itself
as
prosecutor
is
not
injured
and
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
only
point
i
would
make
on
that
is
that
i
think
that
it
should
remain
as
a
matter
of
general
policy
and
certainly
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
a
matter
that
is
the
province
of
the
judge
rather
than
of
the
defense
counsel.
i
would
just
prefer
to
see
and
it
is
simply
and
perhaps
more
a
matter
of
philosophical
views
about
which
we
may
differ
to
see
the
matter.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
yes,
it
does.
i
am
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
that
is
a
possibility
too.
it
is
just
that
we
are
of
the
position
for
the
reasons
that
i
am
arguing
here
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
in
the
brief
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
erring
in
this
matter.
mr.
justice
stevens
spoke
about
the
matter
being
knowing
whether
or
not
the
instruction
would
be
given
or
not
would
in
some
way
directly
or
indirectly,
well,
more
directly
than
indirectly,
would
be
a
matter
of
compulsion
and
would
be
a
matter
which
would
influence
one
way
or
the
other
the
decision
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand.
there
are
two
answers
to
that
neither
of
which
is
--
one
of
which
i
know
was
not
very
good
that
is
it
may
not
be
known
in
advance
whether
or
not
the
judge
in
any
particular
case
is
going
to
give
that.
presumably
of
course
the
defendant
could
inquire
and
would
get
an
answer
from
the
judge,
but
there
may
be
judges
that
are
cantankerous
enough
not
to
answer
a
question
along
those
lines.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no.
that
is
true
too.
the
other
thing
is
it
occurred
to
me
as
i
thought
about
that
though
is
i
think
that
analysis
might
present
some
problems
in
the
future
because
that
could
be
said
of
almost
any
instruction
which
the
trial
court
might
give.
that
might
again
have
some
influence
on
the
defendant.
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
particular
instruction
here
goes
directly
--
to
more
directly
than
most
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
is
to
be
said
about
whether
the
defendant
took
--
takes
the
stand
or
not.
it
may
go
directly
to
the,
more
directly
to
the
issue
of
compulsion
than
some
others,
but
to
some
extent
i
should
think
they
all
would.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
say
yes.
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
i
think
not,
that
is
basically
my
position
and
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
as
i
think
i
answered
mr.
justice
marshall
not
as
articulately
and
not
as
directly
as
that
put
it.
yes,
i
think
that
the
power
to
do
that
and
the
right
to
do
that
remains
with
the
judge
and
should
remain
with
the
judge
in
preference
to
defense
counsel.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
i
wonder
about
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
i
most
certainly
do
not.
mr.
marlow
would
have
--
might
have
another
view
of
it
though
i
rather
doubt
it
when
you
state
the
matter
as
bluntly
as
that.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
judge
might
not
accept
the
guilty
plea
for
that
matter.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
depends
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
your
honor,
is
it
after
the
jury,
the
first
12
jurors
were
chosen
in
this
case
and
before
--
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
the
defendant
offered
to
plea
guilty.
the
defendant
stated
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty
to
this
charge.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
no,
sir
it
was
to
escape
in
the
second
degree.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
which
is
worry
he
was
charged
with.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
the
judge
refused
to
accept
the
instruction
because
of
the
guilty
plea
because
the
insanity
defense
had
been
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
we
are
--
what
are
differences
here
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
it
generally
will
be
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
h.
denney
very
well.
unless
there
are
any
more
questions,
i
really
have
nothing
further
that
oral
argument
will
--
to
add.
