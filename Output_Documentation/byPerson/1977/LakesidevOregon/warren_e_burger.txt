we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
lakeside
v.
oregon.
mr.
margolin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
if
the
defense
counsel
had
asked
for
precisely
this
instruction
and
the
court
said,
“oh!
no,
i
do
not
dare
give
that,”
the
supreme
court
does
not
like
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
he
is
convicted
and
goes
on
appeal
saying
he
had
asked
for
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
on
a
constitutional
right
and
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
all
defense
lawyers
would
agree
with
you
on
that
proposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
denney.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
if
this
is
all
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
part
of
his
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
part
of
his
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
all
this
i
take
it
leading
up
to
the
suggestion
that
it
was
an
assistance
and
aid
and
help
him
to
get
this
instruction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
justice
is
injured,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
lakeside
against
oregon
will
also
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
mr.
