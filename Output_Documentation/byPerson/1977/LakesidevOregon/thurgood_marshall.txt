justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
goes
to
every
time
a
judge
overrules
an
objection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
would
the
line
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
case
you
have
that
is
really
close
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know
anything
in
that
case
that
said
when
you
object
on
question
that
in
effect
of
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
your
first
point.
i
am
telling
that
your
second
point,
that
was
fifth
amendment,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one
do
you
have
on
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
general
language
is
that
if
a
judge
gives
an
instruction
over
the
objection
of
the
defendantâ€™s
counsel
that
is
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
margolin,
let
me
put
in
another
way.
if
we
rule
that
it
is
a
violation
of
fifth
amendment
would
he
be
satisfied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
the
reason
he
did
not
take
the
stand
was
because
he
did
not
want
all
of
this
known?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
are
you
just
flaunting
it
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
i
did
not
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
how
is
the
state
hurt
by
a
rule
which
says
that
the
defendant
does
want
this
instruction,
he
should
not
have
it,
how
is
the
state
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right
and
you
do
not
think
due
process
or
the
people
or
anything,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
pretty
well
gets
down
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
did
was
his
constitutional
right
though.
may
be
you
should
err
on
one
side,
if
you
are
going
to
err?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
not
be
binding
on
them,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
also
did
he
not
pleaded
guilty,
the
judge
would
not
have
anything
to
do,
but
put
him
in
jail,
would
it
not
(voice
overlap),
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
judge
would
not
accept
a
guilty
plea
to
the
maximum
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
i
was
not
talking
about
jurors
being
chosen--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
was
not
mandatory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
what
he
was
charged
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
said
he
was
not
insane?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
my
point
was
you
say
that
that
before
the
justice,
regardless
of
what
the
defendant
says
the
judge
can
still
do
so.
i
am
saying
the
general
rule
is
that
if
a
man
was
to
plea
guilty
for
the
maximum
of
offense,
it
would
be
accepted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
it.
