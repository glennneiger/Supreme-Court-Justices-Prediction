mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ensio
lakeside,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
charged
with
a
felony
crime
of
escape
of
the
second
degree.
because
he
was
indigent,
an
attorney
was
appointed
to
assist
him
in
the
preparation
of
his
defense.
at
trial,
he
raised
a
defense
of
lack
of
criminal
responsibility
and
put
on
witnesses,
including
an
attorney
and
a
psychiatrist
to
support
his
position
and
explain
his
position
to
the
jury.
now,
as
part
of
his
trial
strategy,
it
was
decided
between
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
that
mr.
lakeside
would
not
take
the
stand
and
that
no
comment
on
this
fact
will
be
made
by
mr.
lakeside’s
counsel
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
just
before
instructing
the
jury,
the
trial
judge
told
mr.
lakeside’s
counsel
that
he
was
going
to
read
the
following
instruction
and
the
instruction
reads,
“under
the
laws
of
this
state,
a
defendant
has
the
option
to
take
the
witness
stand
to
testify
in
his
or
her
own
behalf.
if
a
defendant
chooses
not
to
testify,
such
a
circumstance
gives
rise
to
no
inference
or
presumption
against
the
defendant
and
this
must
not
be
considered
by
you
in
determining
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.”
mr.
lakeside’s
attorney
objected
to
the
giving
of
this
instruction
on
the
grounds
that
giving
the
instruction
would
highlight
the
fact
that
mr.
lakeside
had
not
taken
the
stand
and
call
the
jury’s
attention
to
this
fact.
the
court
told
counsel
that
he
felt
that
it
was
best
to
give
this
instruction
so
as
to
protect
the
defendant’s
rights.
now,
the
instruction
was
given
to
the
jury.
on
appeal,
we
have
two
questions
that
we
are
presenting
for
the
court’s
consideration.
first
we
think
that
the
judge’s
action
violated
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
united
states
constitution
that
fifth
amendment
gives
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
the
right
to
decide
not
to
testify
and
this
court
has
held
in
griffin
v.
california
that
if
the
defendant
decides
to
exercise
his
right,
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
should
not
make
a
comment
on
it
to
the
jury.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
even
though
the
judge
was
acting
with
the
best
of
motives
and
even
though
the
instruction
was
worded
so
as
to
be
helpful
to
the
defendant,
nonetheless
in
this
set
of
circumstances
by
reading
that
instruction
the
judge
did
more
harm
than
good
and
in
affect
commented
on
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right
by
the
defendant.
additionally,
we
contend
that
the
trial
judge
violated
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
lakeside
had
a
lawyer
appointed
to
help
him
out
and
to
figure
out
what
his
trial
strategy
should
be.
there
was
a
decision
made
and
the
decision
was
that
they
were
not
going
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
stand
and
we
feel
that
when
the
trial
judge
took
it
upon
himself
to
interfere
with
this
strategy
that
he
was
interfering
with
the
assistance
that
mr.
lakeside
had
been
given
by
his
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
no.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
first
of
all
it
is
obvious,
if
there
is
a
legal
basis
for
the
judge’s
decision,
for
instance,
let
us
say
in
the
course
of
the
trial
a
lawyer
tries
to
put
on
perjury
testimony
or
tries
to
put
on
testimony
which
violates
the
heresy
rule,
in
that
case
the
judge
would
have
to
interfere
with
the
trial
strategy
of
the
defendant
because
that
trial
strategy
would
be
illegal.
in
this
situation,
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
legal
or
ethical
basis
for
the
judge
substituting
his
opinion
of
the
proper
way
to
conduct
a
defense
for
the
decision
of
the
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
in
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
geders
case
and
the
brooks
v.
tennessee
case
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
okay.
the
reason
i
cited
brooks
and
the
reason
i
cited
geders
is
virtually
in
both
situations
where
this
court
held
that
when
a
--
that
the
court
said
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
no.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
right.
brooks
and
geders
were
both
sixth
amendment.
brooks
was
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
and
in
the
geders
case
was
sixth
amendment
and
in
both
of
the
situations
this
court
said
that
the
trial
judge
ordinarily
has
powers
to
do
certain
things.
for
instance
in
brooks
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
i
think
my
basic
position
is
that
i
do
not
know
if
the
two
situations
are
analogous
and
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
our
position
is
that
the
assistance
that
the
attorney
gave
here
was
to
advise
the
client
on
the
exercise
of
another
constitutional
right,
a
constitutional
right
not
to
take
the
stand
and
that
the
trial
attorney
and
the
petitioner’s
position
in
this
should
be
honored
by
the
court
unless
there
is
some
legal
basis
for
the
court’s
intervention
and
the
reason
i
cited
the
geders
case
and
the
brooks
case
was
because
in
those
cases,
the
court
said
in
brooks
that
ordinarily
the
judge
does
have
a
right
to
figure
out
what
the
order
of
proof
will
be
and
in
geders
ordinarily
a
trial
judge
can
decide
when
witnesses
should
be
sequestered,
but
then
the
court
went
ahead
and
said
that
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
these
ordinary
powers
of
the
court
and
the
sixth
amendment,
that
the
sixth
amendment
should
prevail
and
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
interfere
with
this
assistance
that
the
defendant
is
getting
from
his
lawyer.
here,
i
think
it
is
really
a
serious
situation
because
the
defense
counsel
advised
mr.
lakeside
on
the
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
take
the
stand
and
from
a
practical
viewpoint
that
is
about
the
most
important
decision
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
can
make.
the
defendant
who
does
not
take
the
stand,
it
causes
a
lot
of
problems
as
far
as
his
defense
goes
and
he
makes
that
decision
and
then
a
trial
strategy
is
devised
so
as
to
soften
that
blow
with
the
jury,
i
think
it
is
wrong
for
a
trial
judge
to
come
in
at
the
end
of
the
trial
and
interfere
with
the
assistance
in
the
trial
strategy
that
has
been
plotted
out.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
oh!
sure,
of
course.
let
me
go
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
okay,
you
mean
something
like
in
bruno
except
on
constitutional
grounds.
our
position
is
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
has
been
that,
okay,
there
is
further
authority
as
to
whether
what
the
judge
did
here
violates
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
the
problem
that
courts
that
have
ruled
against
our
position
have
is
it
they
cannot
understand
how
instruction
that
supposedly
worded
to
help
a
defendant,
can
ever
hurt
him.
i
think
the
most
important
thing
i
can
put
across
to
this
court
is
that
every
criminal
case
has
a
different
set
of
facts.
you
do
not
have
the
same
situation
in
each
case
and
sometimes
that
instruction
is
very
helpful,
but
sometimes
it
can
hurt
your
client.
i
would
like
to
give
you
two
quick
examples
just
to
show
you
the
realities
of
courtroom
situation
and
how
this
identically
worded
instruction
can
be
good
in
some
cases
and
bad
in
some
cases.
let
us
take
a
situation
where
its
helpful.
you
have
a
murder
case
and
the
defendant
as
made
the
statement
that
he
was
never
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
then
the
police
find
a
fingerprint
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
as
soon
as
the
jury
hears
that
they
are
going
to
be
waiting
to
hear
that
defendant
come
up
on
the
stand
and
tell
them
how
the
fingerprint
got
there
and
if
your
defendant
cannot
take
the
stand,
you
are
going
to
want
to
have
that
instruction
given
in
the
hopes
that
the
jury
will
follow
it
and
not
hold
that
against
him
that
he
did
not
get
up
on
the
stand.
also
i
can
give
you
a
different
situation.
you
have
a
burglary
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
one
point
i
think
should
make
here
also
is
that
because
every
case
has
a
different
set
of
facts,
i
think
that
this
court
should
have
faith
in
the
attorney
who
lives
with
the
case,
who
is
prepared
it
for
months
and
who
conducts
a
voir
dire
and
gets
a
chance
to
size
up
the
jurors
who
are
going
to
be
sitting
on
the
individual
case
and
let
him
make
the
type
of
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
that
in
this
particular
case
the
instruction
should
be
given
or
should
not
be
given.
i
think
the
trial
attorney
has
advantages
over
a
trial
judge
who
just
gets
the
case
on
the
day
of
trial
and
i
note
sometimes
if
you
leave
with
a
case
for
several
months
you
get
insights
into
it
that
a
person
who
just
comes
on
it
for
one
or
two
days
he
never
does.
so
i
think
its
really
important
here
to
put
faith
in
the
trial
attorney
and
let
him
make
that
decision
and
not
give
the
court
the
unfetted
right,
especially
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
advice
on
something
as
important
as
the
exercise
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
not
to
take
the
stand.
getting
back
to
the
second
example,
that
i
want
to
give
the
court,
if
you
have
a
burglary,
a
woman
wakes
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
sees
a
man
in
her
apartment.
she
subsequently
identifies
him
in
a
line
up
and
your
client
is
arrested.
he
comes
to
you
and
he
tells
you
he
is
completely
innocent,
but
he
has
got
a
very
bad
criminal
record,
may
be
involving
burglaries
or
sex
crimes,
something
that
would
upset
the
jury.
additionally,
you
think
he
will
make
a
very
bad
appearance
on
the
stand.
when
you
get
to
trial,
you
put
on
witnesses
that
demolish
the
eyewitness
to
show
that
she
could
not
possibly
have
seen
what
she
said
she
saw.
she
had
been
using
narcotics
that
evening
and
was
out
of
her
mind.
additionally,
you
put
on
25
alibi
witnesses
who
say
that
the
defendant
was
with
them
the
whole
time
that
this
burglary
occurred.
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
jury
probably
is
not
even
going
to
expect
to
hear
from
the
defendant
because
his
witnesses
have
given
the
jury
all
the
information
that
they
would
need
to
arrive
at
a
verdict
in
his
favor
and
i
think
petitioner’s
case
fits
into
that
second
category.
he
had
a
medical
defense,
a
psychiatric
defense.
he
had
put
on
witnesses
who
explained
his
position
to
the
jury
and
probably
had
the
judge
not
read
the
instruction,
the
jurors
would
not
have
been
thinking
too
much
about
the
fact
that
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
now,
i
just
want
to
check
my
notes
because
i
think
that
basically
our
position.
the
only
other
thing
i
did
want
to
go
into
is
an
argument
that
respondent
raised
in
his
brief
and
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
in
the
brief
is
that
you
cannot
have
error
in
a
situation
like
this
because
jurors
will
follow
the
instruction.
so
even
if
the
judge
should
not
have
given
that
instruction,
once
the
jurors
heard
the
instruction,
then
they
would
follow
it
and
there
would
not
be
any
prejudice
to
the
defendant’s
position
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
an
appropriate
argument
for
this
case.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
very
simple.
first
of
all
there
is
debate
for
years
whether
or
not
jurors
do
follow
instruction
or
do
not,
but
if
the
trial
judge
had
honored
the
request
that
was
made
by
the
defense
counsel
and
had
not
given
the
instruction
then
you
would
have
eliminated
the
possibility
that
the
instruction
would
cause
any
harm
and
you
would
eliminate
any
possibility
of
guesswork
or
any
need
to
make
guesses
as
to
what
jurors
do
or
do
not
do.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
i
think
that
he
does.
i
know
this
court
in
bruno
said
that
in
situations
where
he
allows,
you
are
asking
me
a
situation
where
he
does
in
fact
take
the
stand
and
then
asks
for
it?
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
i
do
not
know
if
in
that
situation
whether
it
arrives
to
a
constitutional
level
or
not
since
he
did
exercise
a
constitutional
right.
i
am
not
sure
whether
in
that
type
of
situation
if
it
would
get
to
the
same
level,
but
i
do
think
it
our
in
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
sometimes
you
would
ask
for
the
instruction
anyway
as
means
of
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
by
actually
taking
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
i
think
you
would
waive
the
right,
because
you
have
not
exercised
here.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
sometimes
that
you
would
ask
for
that
instructions
so
as
to
bolster
your
client
to
show
that
he
did
not
ask
for
it.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
yeah,
in
that
situation
i
do
not
think
it
would
get
up
to
a
constitutional
level.
i
do
not
know
whether
you
would
have
any
right
in
that
area,
but
in
our
case
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
okay
the
problem
comes
in
that
in
the
griffin’s
case
this
court
held
that
if
the
person
chooses
not
to
testify
that
it
is
improper
to
comment
on
that
because
that
is
like
penalizing
the
fellow
for
exercising
his
right.
our
position
is
that
this
instruction
hurt
my
client
because
it
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
taken
the
stand
and
it
is
the
same
thing
as
prosecutor
getting
up
and
saying
hey
look
he
did
not
take
the
stand,
why
did
not
he
give
his
side
of
the
story?
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
is
right.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
is
right.
our
position
is
that
the
wording
of
the
instruction
is
not
relevant.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
the
problem
comes
in
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
what
it
does
is,
it
is
a
comment
on
the
fact
that
he
did
not
get
up
and
give
his
side
of
the
story
and
even
though
its
worded
nicely,
it
still
creates
the
evil
of
drawing
attention
to
that
fact.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
yes,
but
griffin
said
that
once
that
decision
to
not
take
the
stand
is
made,
the
prosecutor
or
judge
cannot
comment
on
it.
it
does
not
really
have
anything
to
do
with
the
basis
for
the
fifth
amendment.
it
is
just
talking
in
terms
of
not
penalizing
a
person
for
exercising
his
constitutional
right
and
it
is
our
position
that
you
are
penalizing
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
may
occur.
it
may
also
create
a
situation
where
the
attorney
has
to
try
the
case
differently
and
the
attorney
may
have
to,
for
instance
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
it
may.
i
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
i
would
agree
with
the
court,
it
may
and
that
might
cause
other
serious
difficulties.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
that
is
correct.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
first
that
the
respondent
raised
any
objections
in
any
other
courts
that
heard
this
argument
hearing
it
was
in
its
response
to
petition
for
certiorari.
this
sixth
amendment
argument
was
argued
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
argued
before
the
supreme
court
without
any
objection
by
the
respondent.
if
you
read
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
out
of
oregon,
you
will
see
that
the
trial
strategy
argument
is
basically
was
the
foundation
for
their
opinion
and
the
respondent
was
informed
prior
to
oral
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
sixth
amendment
argument
would
be
raised
in
addition
to
the
argument
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
the
courts
in
oregon
did
consider
this
and
it
is
appropriately
before
this
court.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
supreme
court
did
not
mention
it
and
that
is
why
i
wrote
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
is
in
the
appendix,
but
the
arguments
were
made
in
front
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
i
do
not
know
if
this
court
gets
as
part
of
the
record
the
taping
of
the
oral
argument,
but
that
would
contain
the
arguments.
additionally,
supreme
court
when
it
granted
review
in
this
case,
this
is
also
in
the
petition
for
a
hearing,
the
question
that
it
asked
was
whether
it
was
error
for
the
judge
to
give
the
instruction
over
objection
and
then
what
the
basis
for
such
a
rule
was
and
it
did
limit
the
basis
to
the
fifth
amendment,
so
i
do
think
the
question
is
appropriately
here.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
yes,
two
short
things
your
honor.
first
of
all
i
think
that
this
court
can
confine
itself
to
the
very
narrow
issue
of
whether
in
this
particular
case
if
there
is
a
--
if
you
have
a
petitioner
or
defendant
who
gets
advice
concerning
the
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
whether
in
this
type
of
situation
a
judge
can
give
instructions
over
objection.
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
go
ahead
and
ask
yourselves
how
this
would
affect
other
situations
where
the
righteous
thing
exercised
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
so
i
think
different
considerations
might
arise.
i
think
the
court
could
confine
itself
to
that
very
narrow
issue.
secondly,
i
do
not
think
the
reason
why
a
defendant
in
a
particular
case
does
not
take
the
stand
or
whether
the
trial
strategy
is
correct
or
incorrect
is
relevant.
i
think
the
interesting
question
is
raised
here
as
how
far
is
a
judge
permitted
to
go
in
deciding
how
a
defense
will
be
run.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well,
i
think
you
waive
that
type
of
a
defense
or
probably
that
type
of
a
opposing
claim
or
appeal
if
there
is
a
specific
request,
you
may
not
to
give
the
instruction.
i
mean,
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
waiver
situation
in
those
circumstances
so
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
real
genuine
problem
that
was.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
okay,
i
think
what
happened
is
that
either
imposed
conviction
or
an
appeal
the
question
would
be
--
what
the
question
would
be
was
the
decision
not
to
have
those
instructions
given
a
knowing
and
voluntary
decision
that
was
made
by
the
defendant.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
i
think
that
if
the
defendant
knew
what
he
was
doing,
i
mean,
i
certainly
would
not
advise
it,
but
if
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
he
voluntarily
and
intelligently
made
the
decision
to
not
have
those
instructions
given.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
well--
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
okay,
again
i
would
refer
to
keep
this
on
the
very
narrow
issue
of
the
situation
where
there
is
assistance
of
counsel
because
i
think
you
can
keep
this
in
this
area
without
going
into
other
situations
like
what
happens
with
different
types
of
instructions
or
what
happens
with
a
person
is
representing
himself.
mr.
phillip
m.
margolin
in
feretta
case
the
court
said
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
represent
himself
and
if
he
does
that
and
he
forgoes
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
then
he
makes
that
type
of
a
decision,
he
may
just
be
in
a
situation
where
he
has
done
himself
a
lot
of
injury,
but
if
he
is
doing
it
voluntarily
and
knowingly
and
he
understands
the
consequences
he
just,
that
might
be
the
situation.
but
again
i
do
not
think
that,
that
type
of
situation
should
effect
the
court’s
decision
here
because
here
it
is
a
defendant
who
is
getting
advice
from
an
attorney
who
has
supposedly
have
some
training
and
some
experience
in
these
matters
and
it
is
being
made
through
discussion
and
then
is
being
presented
to
the
court
as
a
particular
way
that
the
defendant
wants
to
run
his
case.
so
i
do
not
think
it
is
running
--
i
do
not
think
the
decision
to
this
case
would
affect
that
type
of
situation.
there
is
nothing
further.
