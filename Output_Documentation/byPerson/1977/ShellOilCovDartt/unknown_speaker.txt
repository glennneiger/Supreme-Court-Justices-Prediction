ms.
matthies,
i
take
it
there
is
no
question
or
intimation
of
bad
faith
in
the
part
of
shell
here.
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
how
was
shell
prejudiced
by
the
result?
unknown
speaker
but
you
certainly
knew
of
her
discomfiture
and
concern,
did
not
you?
unknown
speaker
i
say
you
certainly
knew
of
her
discomfiture
and
concern?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
is
your
position
that
this
period
of
time
is
a
rigid
limitation
period?
unknown
speaker
then
you
concede
there
ever
might
be
circumstances
where
equitable
principles
or
otherwise
might
be
to
an
opposing
result?
unknown
speaker
when
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
congress,
nevertheless,
left
in
this
act
two
different
things,
the
filing
of
claims
and
the
filing
of
letters
of
intent
to
sue,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
so
the
congress
did
not
treat
them
both
as
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
file
a
claim
within
180
days
you
should
just
forget
about
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
be
making
the
same
arguments
if
you
did
one
day
before
the
two
years
expire?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greer,
even
if
you
regard
this
as
a
statute
of
limitations
and
not
jurisdictional
in
the
strictest
sense,
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
which
would
support
a
fraudulent
concealment
type
of
tolling
where
the
defendant
is
responsible
in
some
way
for
the
delay,
fraudulent
concealment
or
any
other
kind
of
context?
unknown
speaker
the
two
people
who
failed
to
advise
her
of
the
right
to
sue
of
the
notice
requirement,
her
lawyer
and
the
department
of
labor?
unknown
speaker
yes
should
it
be
--
should
the
rule
be
that
whenever
an
employee
consults
either
a
government
representative
or
a
lawyer
and
fails
to
be
properly
advised
that
then
you
toll
the
statute,
is
that
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
is
there
precedent
for
that
kind
of
tolling?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
your
principle
argument
then
that
she
complied
in
substance
with
a
180
day
requirement
rather
than
that
the
requirement
is
tolled,
they
are
two
quite
different
arguments?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
you
are
hurt
whenever
you
do
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
that
you
think
you
are
entitled
to.
they
got
to
defend
a
law
suit
instead
of
moving
to
dismiss
on
the
180
day
ground?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they
are
not
being
sued
by
the
labor
department.
they
probably
were
satisfied
that
they
would
not
get
sued
by
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
they
could
if
they
thought
there
was
merit
to
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
position
i
take
it
then
is
that
as
long
as
you
file
a
complaint
you
need
never
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue?
unknown
speaker
and
would
seem
to
me
it
always
would,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
feeling
would
be
if
you
file
a
complaint,
if
you
file
a
complaint
with
the
labor
department
within
60
days
and
without
anything,
without
anymore
ado
you
can
file
your
law
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
labor
department
gives
a
notice
against
a
complaint
that
it
is
too
busy
and
they
do
not
try
to
conciliate
it
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
purpose
of
it,
i
thought
you
said,
was
to
give
the
labor
department
time
to
conciliate
not
to
give
the
defendant
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
department
does
not
investigate
after
the
claim
is
filed,
is
the
claimant
entitled
to
sue
after
60
days
or
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
get
notice
when
the
complaint
is
filed,
i
mean,
when
the
law
suit
is
filed,
they
have
plenty
of
notice?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
to
me
like
then
you
are
saying
that
there
must
be
something
filed
besides
a
complaint
with
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
so
then
so
he
must
do
something
else
besides
file
a
complaint?
unknown
speaker
and
then
if
he
files
it,
after
that
he
files
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
he
files
that
to
the
labor
department,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
so
then
what
if
the
labor
department
does
not
do
anything
then
either?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
defendant
does
not
know
a
thing?
