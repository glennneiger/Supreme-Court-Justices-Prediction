this
act
also
has
a
two-year
limitation,
does
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
if
you
have
this
(inaudible)
as
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
have
this
jurisdiction,
why
do
you
lead
the
two-year
statute
limitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
not
i
assume
from
that
that
she
could
be
injured
unless
it
was
two
years,
at
least
congress
did
not
think
it
would
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
congress
said
if
you
do
not
file
the
suit
within
two
years,
you
cannot
file
it
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
if
you
do
not
file
within
two
years
you
would
be
injured,
the
employer
would
be
injured.
my
query
is
well
how
can
you
be
injured
before
the
two
year,
specifically
at
180
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
it
may
be
dismissed,
i
thought
argument
was
it
had
to
be
dismissed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
may
and
you
have
not
changed
that,
have
you?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
thedepartment
of
labor
prejudiced,
what
did
they
lose?
what
did
they
lose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
women
has
lost
a
job,
i
mean,
what
did
they
lose
compared
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
suggest
that
you
are
getting
in
trouble
here
in
the
phrase
statute
of
limitations
and
arguing
latches
and
they
are
two
different
animals.
you
keep
talking
about
statute
of
limitations
and
an
equitable
proceeding,
how
do
you
come
by
latches?
