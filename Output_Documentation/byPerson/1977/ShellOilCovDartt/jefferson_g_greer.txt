mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
congress
passed
the
age
discrimination
act
in
1967,
they
had
at
that
time,
a
benefit
of
observing
the
machinery
of
title
vii
for
some
three
years
that
was
passed
in
1964.
they
found
that
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
delay
in
title
vii
procedures
in
that
a
person
would
file
a
charge
which
was
required
to
be
in
writing
and
under
oath
incidentally
and
then
the
eeoc
would
began
investigating
that
charge.
it
would
be
months
and
months
and
sometimes
years
before
they
ever
got
their
notice
or
their
right
to
sue
letter.
when
congress
was
considering
that
and
rather
than
amending
the
1964
act,
which
they
could
have
done
very
easily
to
cover
age
discrimination,
they
chose
instead
to
fit
it
into
the
machinery
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
put
it
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
department.
now,
the
60
day
limitation
that
is
a
60
day
notice
of
intent
to
sue
was
of
course
put
in
there
to
trigger
conciliation.
that
the
congress
was
very
heavy
on
conciliation
because
there
are
a
great
many
of
these
cases
filed,
the
labor
department
certainly
cannot
bring
lawsuits
on
all
of
them
and
it
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
shown
by
the
records
of
the
hearings
that
they
certainly
wanted
conciliation,
but
further
than
that
the
60
day
notice
gives
a
claimant
a
right
to
give
that
60
day
notice
and
then
get
on
with
his
law
suit.
he
does
not
have
to
sit
there
and
wait
for
months
to
wait
and
get
this
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
eeoc.
now,
the
180
day
limitation
i
think
was
placed
in
there
for
the
same
reason,
to
speed
up
the
procedure,
simply
to
speed
up
the
procedure.
the
congress
i
think
showed
that
they
wanted
conciliation
procedures
to
begin
and
begin
speedily.
so
the
180
days
limitation
was
placed
in
there
for
that
purpose.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
the
congress
intended
the
180
day
limitation
to
be
jurisdictional.
in
fact,
the
latest
pronouncement
by
senator
williams
who
is
the
floor
manager
for
the
senate
passed
bill,
which
is
now
in
the
house
conference
committee,
stated
very
clearly
that
it
has
never
been
our
intent
that
the
180
day
notice
period
be
considered
a
jurisdictional
requisite.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
now,
i
think
that
the
60
day
notice,
your
honor,
is
a
prerequisite.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
for
an
180
days.
well,
i
think
that’s
too
long.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
think
you
would
have
to
consider
that
if
you
are
going
to
apply
equity,
you
look
at
all
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
what
courts
call
jurisdictional
and
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
to
toll
180
days.
well,
to
filing
a
complaint
with
the
labor
department
as
opposed
to
notice
to
sue,
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
depending
as
in
this
case
where
the
complaint
served
exactly
the
same
purpose
as
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
no,
in
practical
effect
they
have
the
same
effect.
a
complaint
to
the
labor
department
serves,
under
626
(b)
serves
exactly
the
same
purpose
as
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
it
triggers
the
secretary’s
responsibility
to
investigate
and
indeed
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
claimant
filed
her
complaint
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well
no,
i
think
that
the
congress
certainly
intended
that
you
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
but
if
it
serves
the
same
purpose,
here
the
complaint
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
however,
in
this
case
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
was
filed,
belatedly
of
course
some
36
days
late.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
do
not
think
we
can
apply
equity
there
if
they
waited
that
long.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well
your
honor,
that
equity
looks
at
each
case
individually
and
we
have
been
doing
that
for
hundreds
of
years
when
you
toll
a
statute
of
limitation
there
has
to
equity
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
you
would
look
at
each
case,
yes
that
is
right,
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
the
legislative
history
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statutes,
the
provision
for
the
60
day
limitation
is
in
rather
absolute
terms
it
says
no
civil
action
may
be
commenced
until
an
individual
is
given
notice
and
in
the
180
day
timing
probation
it
says,
notice
shall
be
filed.
the
section
255
states
every
action
shall
be
forever
barred,
quite
different
language
than
that
establish
the
60
day
notice.
however,
even
that
provision
has
been
held
not
to
always
bar
the
actions,
as
held
in
the
humphreys
case
from
the
tenth
circuit.
in
considering
this
matter
in
committee
prior
to
the
passage
or
the
act,
the
industry
spokesman
there
are
spoke
of
statute
of
limitations
and
senator
davidson
(ph)
considering
it
referred
to
this
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
we
suggest
that
the
usual
policy
of
repose
which
is
a
justification
for
statutes
limitations
when
it
is
outweighed
by
justice
should
not
be
applied
as
this
court
held
in
the
burnett
case.
we
see
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
a
forfeiture
of
the
claimant's
right
to
file
this
notice
within
a
180
day
process
or
a
180
day
of
period.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
that
we
would
rise
to
--
what
we
would
call
a
fraud.
now,
mr.
spear
(ph)
testified
that
he
contacted
spear
the
very
day
after
--
the
day
that
claimant
made
her
complaint
that
was
nine
days
on
august,
9
following
her
discharge
on
july,
31.
nothing
happened
during
the
negotiations
and
he
did
carry
on
negotiations
with
them
until
november,
27
and
they
told
him
at
that
time
that
they
thought
she
would
been
lawfully
discharged
and
no
further
negotiations.
she
said
they
reached
an
impasse.
they
did
agree
to
furnish
statistical
material
to
them
at
that
time,
but
as
of
march
the
5,
of
1974,
he
still
had
received
nothing
that
he
had
requested
from
shell
oil.
so
yes
they
did
drag
their
feet
on
furnishing
the
material
which
he
had
requested.
so
i
think
we
can
easily
assume
that
had
he
got
the
material
timely,
he
could
have
notified
plenty
before
the
march,
5
that
she
had
this
right
to
sue,
which
he
never
told
them
before
as
he
stated
on
the
hearing
there
himself,
he
blew
it.
he
said,
he
just
did
not
give
her
the
–
did
not
tell
her
about
the
notice
of
the
right
to
sue.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
as
a
bridge
club
member,
a
lady
lawyer
there
that
she
consulted,
told
her
to
go
to
the
labor
department
and
the
labor
department,
yes,
they
did
not
inform.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
i
think
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
things
that
you
can
look
at.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
in
thinking
of
love
v.
pullman
where
the
claimant
filed,
under
title
vii
action,
the
claimant
was
supposed
to
file
a
action
in
the
state
agency,
instead
filed
with
the
federal
agency.
now,
there
never
was
any
claim
of
any
nature
filed
with
the
state
agency.
the
federal
agency
orally
advised
the
state
agency
that
they
were
holding
that
claim
in
abeyance
and
after
which
the
state
agency
said,
well,
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
so
proceed.
so
acting
upon,
at
most
you
could
say
was
that
had
oral
notice
from
another
government
agency
and
that
the
claimant
never
made
any
notice
at
all
and
the
court
there
said
this
serves
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
they
held
that
that
was
alright.
they
said
too
technicalities
were
particularly
inappropriate
where
a
layman
initiate
the
process.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
she
--
i
think
you
can
justify
it
either
way.
i
think
there
are
circumstances
here
that
that
would
justify
tolling
the
180
days,
but
i
think
that
the
complaint
to
the
labor
department
served
exactly
the
same
purpose
as
the
notice
of
the
intent
to
sue.
shell
has
never
been
hurt
here
because
they
never
intended
to
negotiate
anyway.
after
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue
was
served,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
mr.
spear
again
started
negotiations
and
attempted
to
deteriorate
them
on
as
he
had
before.
he
was
rebuffed
by
shell.
they
never
wanted
to
settle.
we
cannot
say
how
their
position
was
any
different
at
that
point
then
it
was
when
he
originally
attempted
to
negotiate
based
on
the
complaint.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes
your
honor,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
when
shell
oil
company
had
notice
of
this
complaint,
they
were
on
notice
that
this
labor
department
could
bring
an
action
at
any
time
and
did
not
have
to
wait
for
any
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
they
could
be
sued
at
any
time.
so
can
they
seriously
contend
that
we
do
not
know
we
are
going
to
be
sued
when
the
labor
department
is
investigating
a
complaint
against
them.
they
have
notice
that
they
could
be
sued,
either
by
the
labor
department
or
by
the
claimant.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
the
labor
department
could
file
it
any
point
of
time
within
two
years.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
they
had
not
at
that
point
determined
it
and
they
never
told
shell,
we
are
not
going
to
sue
you.
there
was
never
any
such
statement
to
shell,
so
they
could
not
rely
on
that.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
labor
department
charged
with
the
administration
of
this
act
had
since
its
passage
in
1967,
taken
the
position
that
this
was
non
jurisdictional
and
mr.
spear
testified
that
only
hearing
in
district
court
and
as
this
court
has
previously
said
in
the
griggs
and
duke
power
co.
case,
the
administration's
interpretation
of
an
act
is
entitled
to
great
difference.
we
suggest
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
slept
on
alright.
she
did
everything
that
a
person
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
do
as
tenth
circuit
found.
she
sought
out
counsel.
she
filed
her
complaint
nine
days
after
they
told
her
that
she
did
not
have
any
potential
because
of
her
age
and
she
made
repeated
calls
to
the
labor
department
and
asked
them
what
is
going
on
my
law
suit
and
to
get
some
sort
of
assurance
from
mr.
spear
and
she
did
what
the
labor
department
poster
said
and
incidentally
it
did
not
have
one
word
on
it
about
any
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
it
says
if
you
think
that
you
have
separate
discrimination
go
to
the
local
wage
and
hour
office
of
the
labor
department
which
is
exactly
what
she
did.
we
think
that
every
purpose
of
the
act
was
served.
the
defendant
had
notice
by
virtue
of
mr.
spear
investigating
the
complaint,
the
labor
department
began
investigation
and
conciliation
just
as
an
intended
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
and
shell
has
suffered.
so
far
we
can
see
no
damage
by
a
36
day
delay.
now
the
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well
your
honor,
our
contention
is
that
if
the
complaint
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
notice
of
intend
to
sue
which
it
did
in
this
case
then
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
can
conceive
of
situations.
there
is
no
time
limit
within
which
the
labor
department
must
negotiate
either
under
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
or
the
complaint.
it
says,
i
shall
do
so
promptly
whatever
that
means,
but
he
is
the
one
that,
the
labor
department
is
the
one
that
interprets
it.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
if
the
purpose
of
act
is
served.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
i
do
not
think
you
can
say
that
the
defendant
had
proper
notice
there.
he
must
have
proper
notice
and
of
course
these
two
cases
that
the
defendant
has
relied
on
so
heavily,
robin
v.
electrical
workers
and
johnson
v.
railway
express,
the
court
pointed
out
there
that
the
procedure
followed
in
pursuing
two-step
remedies
did
not
guarantee
notice
to
the
defendant.
in
the
electrical
workers
case,
they
were
proceeding
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
agreements
procedure,
separate
independent
distinct
action
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
it
serves
to
trigger
the
investigating
responsibilities
of
the
labor
department.
it
does
not
say
that
any
time
limit
that
he
has
there.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
if
the
defendant
has
notice,
i
do
not
think
we
can
say
that.
they
have
to
have
notice,
but
our
contention
here
is
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well
yes,
but
i
think
that
is
why
they
put
the
180
days
in
here
so
that
the
conciliation
would
begin
within
a
180
days.
it
is
merely
to
speed
up
the
process
that
was
bogging
down
title
vii,
the
60
day
notice
as
well
as
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
no
i
am
saying
that
there
must
be
notice
to
the
defendant
certainly.
i
do
not
think
that
if
you
just
file
a
complaint
then
labor
department
ever
got
around
to
it,
i
mean,
the
defendant
certainly
has
to
got
to
have
notice
that
something
is
going
on.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well
yes,
in
this
case
the
--
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
yes.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
he
is
got
--
he
can
go
ahead
and
bring
his
law
suit.
mr.
jefferson
g.
greer
well,
that
is
true.
that
is
why
they
put
the
60
day
notice
in.
i
believe
it
is
so
that
the
claimant
could
get
on
with
these
law
suit
rather
then
waiting
for
the
right
to
sue
letter
which
is
bogged
down
in
title
vii.
they
experience
all
kinds
of
delays
in
waiting
for
the
right
to
sue
letters.
i
may
proceed
with
the
discussion
of
the
electrical
workers
case,
there
you
had
two
separate
and
distinct
remedies
and
the
claimant
had
attempted
to
proceed
under
the
agreement
procedure,
whereas
the
court
said
that
that
would
not
afford
the
notice
to
the
defendant
that
as
the
proceedings
under
title
vii.
likewise
in
johnson
v.
railway
express,
you
had
two
separate
distinct
statutory
remedies.
one
under
title
vii,
one
under
section
1981,
but
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
is
proceeding
under
one
statute,
there
is
one
remedy,
one
cause
of
action.
it
is
whether
the
labor
department
brings
the
action
or
whether
the
plaintiff
brings
the
action.
so
and
since
the
defendant
had
notice,
the
purposes
of
the
act
was
served
in
all
respects,
we
believe
and
we
think
that
as
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
there
was
de
facto
fulfillment
and
that
plaintiff
should
prevail.
