ms.
mary
t.
matthies
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
and
application
of
section
626
(d)
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
section
626
(d)provides
that
with
prior
to
the
institution
of
a
civil
action
by
a
private
individual
under
the
act,
the
individual
must
give
180
days
notice
to
the
secretary
of
labor
of
their
intent
to
sue
and
then
must
then
afford
the
secretary
of
labor
60
days
in
which
to
conciliate
or
mediate
the
dispute.
the
issues
presented
here
are
basically
two
fold.
the
first
issue
and
we
submit
that
the
case
could
in
fact
be
decided
on
a
narrower
ground
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
improperly
intruded
upon
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
district
court
in
overturning
the
decision
by
the
district
court
that
the
relative
equities
in
this
case
did
not
warrant
a
tolling
of
the
180
day
time
period
set
forth
in
section
626
(d).
the
broader
grounds
is
whether
section
626
(d)
is
a
substantive
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
suit
or
is
more
analogous
to
a
statute
of
limitations
and
if
it
is
more
analogous
to
a
statute
of
limitations
and
thereby
subject
to
similar
toning
principles,
whether
the
actions
by
mrs.
dart
brought
this
case
within
one
of
the
recognized
tolling
principles.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
obviously,
your
honor
our
first
contention
is
that
it
is
a
substantive
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
suit.
we
believe
that
both
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
indicate
a
congressional
intent
to
circumscribe
the
private
right
of
action
and
to
have
the
180
day
period
not
modified,
except
perhaps
in
very
egregious
circumstances
certainly
not
present
in
the
record
here.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
for
instance
indicates
that
the
180
day
period
was
not
initially
contained
in
the
house
pass.
the
senate
included
the
180
day
requirement
and
then
the
house
receded
to
the
senate's
request
for
the
180
day
requirement.
the
180
day
requirement
was
lobbied
extensively
for
by
management
in
order
to
circumscribe
the
right
of
action
of
individuals
and
in
order
to
give
we
believe
the
department
of
labor
close
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
age
discrimination
cases.
employers
did
not
want,
we
believe
the
congressional
and
legislative
history
says,
employers
did
not
want
any
private
right
of
action
to
be
maintained,
because
they
could
see
the
possibility
of
frivolous
lawsuits
being
brought
and
frivolous
lawsuits
are
of
course
expensive
and
it
is
clear
that
the
employers
clearly
preferred
that
there
would
be
a
limited
right
for
private
action
only
in
the
first
180
day
period,
only
if
notice
to
the
intent
of
sue
was
given
in
the
180
day
period.
we
believe
also
that
clear
statutory
language
which
is
of
course
the
best
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
sets
forth
that
such
a
notice
shall
be
filed
within
180
day.
mrs.
dartt
contends,
i
believe
alternatively,
that
either
her
oral
complaint
to
the
department
of
labor
within
the
180-day
period
satisfied
or
it
tolled
the
time
for
her
to
meet
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue
requirement
within
clearly
her
oral
complaint
which
she
stipulated
and
included
no
evidence
of
suing
or
of
an
intent
to
sue
shell.
we
believe
her
oral
complaint
clearly
did
not
satisfy
the
180
day
notice
requirement
and
that
court
of
appeals
so
found.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
however,
that
the
180
day
period
was
analogous
to
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
therefore,
could
be
tolled
on
certain
equitable
grounds.
we
believe
that
even
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
it
is
holding
that
the
180
day
time
period
is
analogous
to
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
certainly
was
incorrect
in
finding
that
based
upon
substantial
precedents
by
this
court
that
this
case
is
or
that
the
situation
here
warranted
a
tolling
of
that
time
period.
to
recognize
equitable
grounds
for
tolling
of
180
day
requirement
or
a
statute
of
limitations
requirement,
that
the
defendant
has
acted
in
some
way
to
mislead
or
prevent
the
plaintiff
from
acting,
that
the
plaintiff
was
acting
under
some
kind
of
recognized
legal
disability
or
that
the
plaintiff
was
prevented
by
operation
of
law
from
acting
to
preserve
their
rights.
we
believe
the
fact
situation
here
establishes
and
the
record
so
shows
that
all
mrs.
dartt
did
was
she
called
an
attorney,
preliminarily
after
she
felt
that
she
had
been
discharged
because
of
her
age,
the
attorney
did
not
tell
her
of
the
notice
requirement.
the
attorney
told
her
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor.
she
went
to
the
department
of
labor.
the
department
of
labor
treated
her
complaint
as
being
a
complaint
which
could
activate
the
administrative
investigative
mechanisms,
did
not,
the
department
of
labor
stated
that
it
did
not
consider
her
oral
complaint
to
be
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
in
fact,
it
advised
shell
that
no
notice
of
intent
to
sue
had
been
filed
and
then
proceeded
to
process
a
complaint.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
circumstances
indicate
mrs.
dartt
and
i
am
stepping
back
just
a
moment,
mrs.
dartt
also
stated
that
when
she
went
to
the
department
of
labor,
she
sat
down.
i
believe,
i
thought
well,
as
thedepartment
of
labor
would
handle
it
then
why
bother
with
an
attorney,
why
bother
with
the
expensive
attorney.
she
was
asked
in
the
district
court
whether
she
made
any
inquiry
as
what
was
necessary
to
preserve
her
rights,
if
she
had
inquired
it
any
time
from
the
department
of
labor
as
to
what
she
needed
to
do
and
her
answer
was
no
that
she
did
not,
that
she
went
to
them
and
she
thought
they
would
take
care
of
everything,
and
therefore,
she
had
properly
relied
upon
them
to
advise
her
of
180
day
notice
of
intent
to
sue
requirement
which
the
department
of
labor
did
not
do,
but
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
they
had
statutory
obligation
to
do.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
believe
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
show
any
bad
faith
or
evil
machinations
or
anything
of
that
nature
your
honor.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
shell
was
prejudice
by
the
result,
your
honor,
because
it
was
never
given
early
on
a
notice
that
mrs.
dartt
intended
to,
thought
to
maintain
a
civil
action
against
it
and
the
notice
that
the
--
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
we
knew
that
she
had
filed
in
or
registered
an
oral
complaint
with
the
department
of
labor.
the
department
of
labor
had
told
shell
that
she
had
not
filed
any
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
so
we
knew
that
thedepartment
of
labor
had
her
complaint
before
it,
that
they
were
in
the
process
of
investigating
her
complaint.
it
was
in
shell's
position
that
a
complaint
had
absolutely
no
matter
whatsoever
and
we
fully
believed
that
the
department
of
labor
upon
a
complete
investigation
would
so
find
and
we
would
be
without
any
suit
whatsoever,
because
we
were
in
the
posture
where
we
had
no
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
we
were
not
given
the
opportunity
within
the
time
which
congress
established
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
possibility
that
she
was
going
to
sue
us,
and
therefore,
look
at
settlement
in
light
of
nuisance
lawsuit
value,
which
may
still
have
been
to
her
benefit
in
light
of
possibly
increased
litigation
expenses.
i
think
that
anybody
who
has
been
in
practice
knows
that
when
they
are
dealing
with
a
client,
the
client
is
pinched
when
a
claim
is
initiated,
say
for
instance
a
contract
claim
someone
writes
and
says
you
owe
me
such
and
such
and
so
and
so.
that
they
are
not
as
inclined
to
settle
that
case
as
they
are
when
they
get
a
clearcut
notice
through
the
attorney
calling
the,
the
attorney
for
the
opposing
side
calling
the
attorney
for
the
client
or
through
some
other
means
where
they
get
clear
cut
notice
that
they
are
going
to
be
sued
if
they
do
not
accept.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
we
believe
that
there
is
nothing
inherently
unfair
to
mrs.
dartt.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
concede
your
honor
that
in
certain
rather
egregious
situations,
for
instance,
i
think
if
mrs.
dartt
had
been
able
to
show
that
shell
had
immediately
upon
discharging
her,
hurried
her
off
and
locked
her
up
in
a
mexican
jail
for
six
months
and
thereby
she
had
been
enable
to
fulfill
her
notice
of
intent
to
to
sue
requirement
and
we
did
this
knowing
full
though
that
we
were
prohibiting
her
from
doing
that,
that
fundamental
principles
of
justice
would
certainly,
i
think
hold
that
no
one
can
profit
from
and
they
are
wrong,
and
therefore,
the
time
limits
could
be
modified
in
that
situation,
although
i
am
not
really
sure
in
that
sort
of
a
situation.
it
would
even
be
a
tolling
so
much
as
it
would
be
an
adjustment
of
the
equities.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
think
that
yes
your
honor
there
would
certainly
be
those
three
possibilities.
i
believe
that
the
plaintiff
in
fact
argued
in
the
district
court,
although
did
not
continue
to
press
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
my
recollection,
that
the
180
day
requirement
was
in
fact
what
i
believe
they
termed
as
directory
rather
than
the
mandatory
and
that
would
fall
into
i
suppose
what
you
call
the
third
classification
of
cases.
i
do
not
really
think
that
we
can
--
that
this
time
limitation,
the
180
day
time
limitation
would
fall
into
the
third
category
of
cases.
i
think
the
close
analogy
perhaps
of
the
180
day
requirement
here
to
the
180
day
requirement
under
title
vii
indicates
that
it
is
in
fact
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
suit.
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself
indicates
that
the
filing
of
the
notice
for
intent
to
sue
within
the
180
day
period
is
in
fact
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
suit.
i
note
in
the
senate
report
on
the
new
possible
amendments
to
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
that
the
senate
when
they
deleted
the
180
day
requirement
from
the
notice
of
intent
to
sue
provision
stated
that
they
were
deleting
the
requirement
of
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
which
i
think
kind
of
tends
to
indicate
that
the
senate
--
that
the
180
day
requirement
was
a
substantial
requirement.
and
the
legislative
history
itself
indicates
that
the
senate
considered
it
to
be
a
substantial
requirement
when
the
house
deleted
the
180
day
requirement
when
the
senate
passed
bill
and
the
senate
put
it
right
back
in
saying
we
want
there
to
be
a
180
day
limitation.
so
if
we
were
to
take
the
position
here
that
we
were
going
to
allow
any
kind
of
tolling,
for
instance
is
the
180
day
requirement,
i
think
what
we
get
into
your
honor
is
adapting
on
approach
that
the
house
and
the
senate
ended
up
specifically
rejecting,
because
the
house
bill
had
provided
for
the
allowance
of
a
filling
of
a
notice
for
intent
to
sue
any
time
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
the
two
year
statue
to
limitations
period.
and
the
senate
said
no,
we
want
a
notice
of
intent
to
suit
filed
within
a
180
days
and
i
think
that
that
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
congress
considered
it
to
be
a
substantial
requirement.
so
turning
back
to
the
decisions
by
or
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals.
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
saying
so,
the
court
of
appeals
i
believe
followed
what
could
be
characterized
as
an
extension
of
the
tolling
principles
annunciated
by
this
court
in
burnett
v.
the
new
york
central
railroad
company
and
the
rationale
behind
the
tolling
allowed
by
the
tenth
circuit
was
that
in
this
particular
situation
they
felt
that
the
de
facto
purposes,
the
filling
of
the
or
the
registering
of
the
oral
complaint
and
a
subsequent
isolated
settlement
inquiry
by
the
department
of
labor
fulfilled
the
notice
and
conciliation
functions
of
section
626
(d),
and
therefore,
there
was
no
particular
reason
in
this
situation
to
not
toll
the
180
day
time
limitation.
we
do
not
believe
that
burnett
is
controlling
here.
we
believe
that
the
rationale
of
burnett
applies
to
a
very,
very
limited
situations.
in
the
first
place,
burnett
dealt
with
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
the
burnett
facts
were
significantly
different
from
the
facts
present
in
this
particular
case.
in
burnett,
the
defendant
received
all
of
the
notice
contemplated
by
the
statute
and
otherwise
valid
complaint
was
issued.
there
was
no
defect
in
process
or
in
service
of
process.
the
only
defect
was
in
venue.
the
fact
that
there
was
only
a
defect
in
venue
was
deemed
important
because
congress
had
number
one,
expressed
a
desire
for
uniform
time
limitations
by
enacting
the
statute
of
limitations
provisions
in
philiff
(ph)
and
to
not
allow
tolling
would
have
caused
a
substantial
non
uniformity
in
time
limitations
because
many
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government
had
savings
or
venue
transfer
provisions
and
that
had,
if
the
plaintiff
resided
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
then
where
he
did,
in
burnett,
there
was
a
good
possibility
that
his
cause
of
action
would
have
been
safe.
and
this
court
looking
at
the
fact
that
there
was
only
a
defect
in
venue
and
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
indicated
its
desire
for
uniform
time
limitations
in
philiff
(ph)
and
also
noting
that
the
congress
had
indicated
a
desire
for
saving
improperly
venued
actions
by
allowing
transfer,
having
enacted
a
statute
to
that
precise
effect,
this
court
decided
that
there
should
be
a
tolling
in
burnett.
it
is
also
significant
in
burnett
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
lost
all
means
of
relief.
it
is
also
significant
in
burnett
that
the
defendant
could
have
waived
according
to
this
court
the
defect
in
venue.
if
in
fact
that
the
section
in
626
(d)
requirement
is
jurisdictional
as
we
can
contend
then
it
is
clear
and
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
courts
have
so
held
that
a
party
cannot
waive
a
jurisdictional
defect.
it
cannot
be
waived
even
with
consent
of
the
parties,
whereas
the
defect
of
venue
in
burnett
could.
there
was
also
and
i
think
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
important
differences,
there
was
a
fixed
time
period
in
burnett
to
which
the
tolling
would
apply
so
that
you
had
clearcut
periods
from
the
time
of
the
institution
of
the
action
to
the
time
when
the
action
was
dismissed
where
you
could
say
yes
a
tolling
in
fact
occurred
here.
i
do
not
believe
and
i
think
this
would
be
an
interesting
question
to
ask
a
person,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
triggering
period
where
you
can
say
that
the
statute
was
tolled
here
and
then
starts
again
here,
if
you
allow
tolling
for
oral
complaints.
you
have
an
oral
complaint
filed
with
the
department
of
labor
then
when
does
the
statute
to
start
run
again.
does
it
run
when
they
actual
knowledge
of
the
notice
requirement?
can
this
tolling
extended
definitely
and
thereby
toll
the
255
two-year
statute
of
limitations?
what
is
the
triggering
effect
of
that?
we
also
believe
that
the
express
ruling
by
this
court
and
the
unexcelled
chemical
corporation
case
with
respect
to
the
portal,
the
construction
of
portal
to
portal,
time
limitations
indicates
quite
clearly
that
no
tolling
is
permissible
of
the
section
255
two-year
statute
of
limitations
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
secretary
is
engaging
in
administrative
investigation
and
conciliation
functions
under
the
act.
we
have
here
the
portal
to
portal
time
limitations
assuming
that
we
have
what
could
be
characterized
here
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
plaintiff
has
shown
no,
mrs.
dartt
has
shown
no
circumstances
here
or
no
situation
here
different
from
what
this
court
was
presented
in
unexcelled
chemical
corp
and
in
the
unexcelled
chemical
corporation
case,
this
court
expressly
held
that
if
congress
thought
that
prejudice
would
occur
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
tolling
at
the
limitation
period
during
the
time
when
administrative
actions
of
the
department
of
labor
were
being
undertaken
then
congress
could
go
about
remedying
that
particular
situation.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
yes
your
honor,
a
two-year,
three-year
willful,
but
yes.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
though
180
say
period
--
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
once
the
plaintiff
has
filed
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
then
the
plaintiff
is
not
required
to
bring
suit
immediately,
but
they
must
bring
suit
sometime
within
the
two-year
limitations
provision,
so
the
180
day
period
is
not
a
limitation
provision.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
we
believe
that
we
can
be
injured
your
honor
because
the
employer
and
the
departmentof
labor
suits
or
an
employee
and
the
department
of
labor
lawsuit
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
are
two
entirely
different
situations.
an
individual
can
bring
a
private
right
of
action,
there
does
not
have
to
under
title
vii
standards
any
finding
of
reasonable
cause
by
the
agency.
the
employee
can
simply
file
a
suit,
that
too
frivolous
suit,
lots
of
merit
to
it,
no
merit
to
it
at
all,
if
they
act
quickly
to
preserve
that
right
and
act
within
a
180
days
to
give
their
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
on
the
other
hand,
the
department
of
labor
is
required
to
investigate
and
to
weed
out
frivolous
suits
and
then
to
bring
suit
itself
within,
also
within
that
two-year
limitation
period
and
the
fact
that
there
is
two-year
limitation
period
in
addition
to
the
180
day
requirement,
i
think
indicates
that
the
180
day
requirement
is
there
for
a
reason.
and
we
submit
that
the
reason
that
the
180
day
requirement
is
there
is
precisely
to
have
the
effect
we
just
had
here
which
is
to
weed
out
the
complaints
of
individuals
who
do
not
act
within
a
timely
manner
to
assert
their
right
to
file
a
suit
by
filing
a
notice
of
an
intent
to
sue.
we
think
that
the
arguments
that
that
is
a
short
of
too
short
of
time
limitation
are
frankly
addressed
to
the
wrong
branch
of
government
when
they
are
addressed
to
this
court.
in
fact,
we
really
think
that
the
fact
that
they
maybe
short
begs
the
question
or
the
fact
that
lawsuits
may
be
dismissed
as
a
result
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
180
day
requirement,
begs
the
question
because
the
necessary
and
expected
result
of
the
short
limitation
is
--
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
it
had
to
be
dismissed.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
your
honor
i
have
not
changed.
no,
i
do
submit
that
it
is
a
mandatory
requirement
and
i
think
we
ought
to
analogize
that
requirement
in
fact
to
title
vii
standards.
under
title
vii
if
a
charging
body
does
not
file
a
charge
with
the
ese
within
a
180
days,
their
right
to
sue
is
lost
entirely
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
particular
period
which
is
over
and
above
the
two-year
limitation
on
back
hand
to
title
vii
is
in
fact
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite.
and
i
point
out
that
the
effects
on
a
title
vii
plaintiff
of
applying
the
180
day
charging
requirement
as
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
are
much
more
severe
than
they
are
here,
because
here
mrs.
dartt
still
had
a
remedy
expressly
approved
by
congress.
she
had
instituted
a
complaint
with
the
department
of
labor.
the
department
of
labor
could
in
fact
act
on
her
complaint
and
could
in
fact
sue
on
her
behalf
if
it
were
so
inclined.
so
the
strict
application
of
the
time
limitation
in
this
particular
situation
is
much
less
harsh
in
operation
than
it
is
to
strictly
apply
it
in
the
case
of
title
vii
plaintiffs.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
i
do
not
really
think
it
is.
i
think
that
clearly
in
a
180
days
you
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
facts
or
have
witnesses
die
or
things
of
this
nature.
i
think
that
the
180
--
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
well,
there
is
my
point.
obviously
statute
of
limitations
are
arbitrary
and
they
are
established
to
cut
off
rights
justifiably
or
not,
but
i
think
that
that
real
purpose
of
the
180
day
requirement
is
in
fact
to
let
the
employer
know
that
it
is
going
to
be
sued,
because
we
all
know
that
if
you
know
that
you
are
going
to
be
sued,
you
are
more
inclined
to
go
about
settling
the
case
in
a
speedy
fashion.
it
also
acts
as
a
trigger
to
the
department
of
labor,
to
let
the
department
of
labor
know
which
cases
it
has
in
its
office,
it
needs
to
devote
concerted
conciliation
activities
to
hear.
for
instance
in
this
case,
when
mrs.
dartt
registered
her
oral
complaint,
the
department
of
labor
just
kind
of
put
the
case
in
its
normal
processing
and
to
look
at
it
and
never
asked
shell,
even
made
its
preliminarily
cursory
inquiry
as
to
whether
shell
was
interested
in
settling
until
some
80
or
better
days
after
the
complaint
had
been
registered
with
it.
so
the
department
of
labor
is
i
would
as
equally
prejudiced
as
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
employer
are
when
the
notice
for
intent
to
sue
is
not
given.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
the
department
of
labor
lost
the
ability
to
know
when
it
got
--
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
comparable
to
that
i
am
not
sure.
all
of
the
same
i
do
believe
that
the
department
of
labor
in
its
administration
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
certainly
needs
to
know
when
it
is
supposed
to
exert
exhaustive
conciliation
efforts
and
when
it
is
not
supposed
to
exert
exhaustive
conciliation
efforts.
normally,
the
department
of
labor
will
not
exert
exhaustive
conciliation
efforts
until
after
they
have
decided
there
is
merit
to
the
charge.
however,
there
is
an
exception
to
that
and
they
will
exert
exhaustive
conciliation
efforts
where
they
do
get
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue.
they
did
not
exert
exhaustive
conciliation
efforts
here
because
they
did
not
know
they
had
to,
because
they
did
not
think
they
had
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
and
i
think
that
is
important.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
mary
t.
matthies
there
were
several
questions
which
were
presented
to
mr.
greer
that
i
believe
warrant
some
further
discussion.
i
believe
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
that
if
there
was
any
evidence
of
fraudulent
concealment
in
this
particular
case
and
mr.
greer
responded
that
i
guess
the
fraudulent
concealment
with
the
supposed
of
dragging
of
the
feet
by
shell
with
respect
to
furnishing
information.
first
place
i
do
not
think
that
mere
dragging
of
one's
feet
would
amount
to
fraudulent
concealment
under
any
cases
that
i
know
dealing
with
fraudulent
concealment.
in
the
second
place
it
is
simply
not
in
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
shell
was
dragging
its
feet.
there
were
no
statements
made
by
mr.
spear
the
wage
and
hour
investigator
stating
that
he
thought
that
the
delay
was
unreasonable.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
believe
this,
the
statements
to
that
effect
by
the
court
of
appeals
were
no
more
than
sheer
speculation
as
to
the
reasons
for
the
delay.
shell
on
the
hand
presented
evidence
showing
that
the
reasons
for
the
delay
was
they
put
large
amount
of
data
which
the
department
of
labor
wanted.
of
course
if
the
department
of
labor
had
thought
that
the
delay
was
unreasonable,
the
department
of
labor
could
have
subpoenaed
the
data,
which
it
did
not
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
the
department
of
labor
even
contacted
shell
but
tweaks
the
time
that
it
requested
the
data
and
shell
called
the
department
some
two-and-a-half
months
later
to
say
we
are
working
on
it
and
we
are
almost
through
and
we
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
where
we
are.
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
evidence
in
record
that
would
establish
fraudulent
concealment.
mr.
justice
stevens,
also
i
believe
asked,
whether
there
is
any
precedent
for
tolling
where
the
government
fails
to
advice
a
plaintiff
of
its
rights
and
i
believe
mr
greer
responded
that
he
thought
that
love
v.
pullman
applied
to
this
particular
situation.
i
question
love
v.
pullman's
applicability.
in
first
place
in
love
v.
pullman,
there
was
at
issue
whether
or
not
the
actions
of
the
government
fulfilled
the
purposes
of
title
vii
and
it
appeared
that
there
was
wrongful
advice
in
fact
given
with
respect
to
what
needed
to
be
done
as
opposed
to
here
which
was
simply
an
omission,
which
mrs.
dartt
we
believe
could
surely
have
corrected
herself,
had
she
made
just
a
minimal
increase,
do
i
have
to
wait,
look
guys
handling
this
thing
any
longer,
or
is
there
something
else
i
can
do,
do
i
have
any
other
rights,
what
should
i
do,
where
should
i
go,
how
do
i
proceed.
mrs.
dartt
did
not
do
that.
i
believe
that
the
mr
greer
also
stated
that
mrs.
dartt
followed
everything
that
that
adea
poster
required
her
to
do.
in
other
words,
she
went
to
the
department
of
labor
and
that
is
what
the
adea
posters
state.
i
do
not
know
how
the
adea
posters
difference,
had
it
in
fact
included
some
kind
of
provision
with
respect
to
that
would
it
help
mrs.
dartt
because
she
testified
before
the
lower
court
that
she
in
fact
did
not
see
the
poster
and
she
never
thought
it
was
in
fact
up
and
so
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
evidence
based
on
sheerly
upon
the
alleged
inadequacy
as
a
poster
for
i
told
in
here.
