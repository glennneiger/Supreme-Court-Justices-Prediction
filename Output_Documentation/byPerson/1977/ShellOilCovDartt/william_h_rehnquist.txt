justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
not
you
really
have
three
alternatives
here
rather
than
to
the
first
being
the
type
of
limitation
applies
from
your
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
there
just
virtually
are
no
exceptions
for?
then
the
second
being
the
statute
of
limitations
type
of
thing
that
as
my
brother
blackmun
suggests,
there
might
well
be
tolling
situations
that
are
fairly
well
established
by
law.
and
the
third
being
a
sort
of
principle
of
latches
which
would
be
a
good
deal
losing
and
where
if
the
defendant
could
not
show
any
prejudice
you
might
permit
them
to
proceed
without
any
great
showing
of
equitable
tolling
principles
on
their
side?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
of
neither
a
claim
nor
intent
to
sue
notice
was
filed
within
a
180
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
what
if
neither
is
filed
within
the
180
days,
neither
a
claim,
nor
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue,
what
if
nothing
happens
for
a
180
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
is
a
jurisdictional
provision,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
jurisdictional
provision
then,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
some
circumstances
where
the
180
days
is
jurisdictional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whether
you
call
it
jurisdictional
or
not,
he
is
not
going
to
get
very
far
if
he
does
not
do
something
within
180
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
claim
that
this
filing
of
claim
is
enough
to
toll
180
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
you
would
have
the
full
two
years
given
to
you
to
bring
an
action
in
district
court,
once
you
file
a
complaint
with
the
labor
department?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
up
the
district
court
to
balance
every
single
individual
case
as
to
how
many
days
they
waited
beyond
the
180
day
period?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
your
answer
is
yes.
