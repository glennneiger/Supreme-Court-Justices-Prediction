mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
as
was
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
an
unpublished,
non
precedential
opinion,
involves
several
fourth
amendment
questions,
each
arising
out
of
the
warrantless
arrest
one
evening
of
the
four
teenage
black
males
found
one
night
in
the
crowded
dwelling
in
chicago,
illinois.
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
corrections,
the
respondent
in
this
court,
asked
this
court
to
resolve
the
fourth
amendments
questions
on
the
basis
of
evidence
received
by
the
district
court
at
a
hearing
on
an
untimely
motion
to
reconsider.
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
it
relied
on
that
testimony.
it
resolved
quite
disputed
questions
of
fact
in
the
first
instance
and
it
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
first
question
which
the
court,
could
resolve
in
this
case
and
which
could
indeed
be
dispositive
of
all
the
other
issues
presented,
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
relying
on
the
testimony
which
had
been
heard
by
the
district
judge
in
the
untimely
motion
to
reconsider.
it
is
our
position,
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
entertain
an
untimely
motion
to
reconsider
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
appeal
from
that
untimely
motion
to
reconsider
and
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
done,
would
have
have
been
to
dismiss
this
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
the
other
question
which
the
court
could
also
resolve
is
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
court
of
appeals
to
rely
on
an
unpublished
opinion
(inaudible)
deprived
its
decision
of
precedent.
that
is
--
it
is
our
position
to
that
--
the
use
of
that
rule
is
interrelated
with
disposition
in
this
case
and
that
question
could
also
be
considered
by
the
court,
but
the
only
issue
which
the
court
need
to
decide
in
order
to
grant
mr.
browder
the
primary
relief
which
he
desires
is
to
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court's
order
granting
mr.
browder's
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
be
reinstated
and
mr.
browder
re-enlarged
in
custody.
the
time
limits
in
which
a
motion
to
reconsider
maybe
made
have
for
the
last
30
years
been
delimited
by
the
ten
days
of
civil
rule
59.
the
motion
to
reconsider
in
this
case
was
made
28
days
after
entry
of
the
final
order
and
was
untimely
under
rule
59.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
final
order
is
the
order
which
disposes
of
the
case,
the
order
which
leaves
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
execute
what
the
district
judge
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
argument
could
be
made,
but
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
type
of
final
order
which
is
appropriate
in
habeas
corpus
cases
and
which
this
court
has
in
directing
the
lower
courts
to
enter
when
an
order
less
than
--
an
unconditional
release
is
appropriate.
this
goes
back
to,
i
think
chessman
v.
teets
where
there
was
some
problem
in
the
way
the
state
court
record
had
been
prepared.
this
court
felt
properly,
i
believe,
that
it
would
be
improper
to
release
mr.
chessmen
because
of
this
procedural
error
which
could
be
cured
and
directed
the
district
court
to
enter
such
orders
as
would
be
appropriate
to
allow
the
state
a
reasonable
time
to
cure
the
error,
failing
which
the
prisoner
would
be
released.
that
is
what
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case.
he
decided
that
the
petition
should
be
granted
and
he
told
illinois
that
they
have
60
days
to
retry
mr.
browder,
failing
which
the
writ
would
be
executed.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
appropriate
kind
of
the
final
order
when
an
order
less
to
have
that
release
is
appropriate
and
the
state
could
have
retried
mr.
browder
if
it
had
acted
within
that
60
days
or
if
the
courts,
the
state
courts
which
you
have
congested,
i
am
sure
the
warden
could
have
come
to
the
district
judge
and
say
we
need
more
time
to
retrial
because
there
are
delays
in
state
court
and
the
district
judge
i
think
would
have
extended
that
time
and
they
would
have
had
an
ample
time
to
retrial
if
that
is
what
they
wish
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
he
erred
in
doing
that,
but
whether
he
erred
in
doing
that
is
not
really
before
this
court.
yes,
we
did
seek
review
at
that
stage.
we
objected
to
the
district
judge,
proceeding
with
the
hearing,
pointing
out
to
him
that
the
time
in
which
he
can
alter
or
amend
earlier
order
had
elapsed,
but
the
district
judge
proceeded
with
the
hearing
and
received
evidence.
the
argument
that
is
raised
by
the
director
as
to
why
that
order,
granting
the
petition
was
not
the
final
order
is
the
claim
that
that
order
left
unanswered,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
required.
that
is
a
difficult
point
to
understand
because
it
seems
obvious,
that
when
the
district
judge
said,
this
petition
should
be
granted
on
the
state
court
record,
he
was
making
a
decision
that
no
hearing
was
required.
he
was
making
a
decision
that
the
state
should
appeal
his
order
or
the
state
should
retry
mr.
browder
or
the
state
should
release
him
from
custody.
and
what
the
state
did,
rather
that
to
follow
one
of
those
three
permissible
alternatives
was
to
file
an
untimely
motion
to
reconsider
and
asked
the
district
judge
to
hear
further
evidence
and
re-adjudicate
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest.
the
district
judge
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hold
that
hearing
and
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
appeal
from
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
then
it
would
be
timely
under
rule
59,
the
time
to
appeal
would
be
tolled.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
explain
why
they
did
not
and
there
is
never
been
any
explanation
by
the
state
or
by
the
director
as
to
why
they
waited
28
days.
this
rule
is
not
a
novel
rule.
it
is
--
there
is
no
explanation.
the
other
fact
about
the
untimeliness
is
that
the
district
judge
in
this
case
did
nothing
to
lull
the
director
into
failing
to
appeal
within
the
30
days
of
rule
4
of
the
appellate
rules.
the
motion
was
filed
on
the
28th
day.
under
local
rules,
in
the
urban
district
of
illinois
could
have
been
presented
in
open
court
for
a
ruling
at
that
time,
but
instead
it
was
filed
in
absolutely
dormant
under
district
court's
calender.
so,
there
is
a
decision
by
the
director
to
rely
upon
the
presumed
power
of
the
district
judge
to
reconsider
a
final
order
after
more
than
ten
days
have
elapsed.
the
district
judge
lacked
that
power
and
should
not
have
received
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
dieter
is
consistent
with
our
position.
dieter
and
united
states
v.
healy
arose
in
cases
under
the
criminal
rules
where
under
rule
4
(b)
of
the
appellate
rules,
there
is
no
tolling
rule
on
motions
to
reconsider.
so
that
--
in
criminal
cases,
when
a
motion
to
reconsider
is
filed
by
the
government
in
the
time
in
which
an
appeal
can
be
perfected,
the
filing
of
that
motion
tolls
the
time
to
appeal.
the
same
rule
is
inapplicable
to
cases
where
appealability
is
determined
by
rule
4
(a).
dieter
states
the
general
rule
which
is
applicable
that
only
timely
motions
to
reconsider,
stay
the
time
to
appeal.
in
dieter,
a
time,
in
a
criminal
case,
a
timely
motion
is
when
filed
within
the
time
in
which
the
government
can
appeal,
in
habeas
corpus
case,
in
a
civil
case,
in
any
case
where
appealability
or
where
the
time
to
appeal
is
governed
by
rule
4
(a).
a
timely
motion
to
reconsider
is
one
made
within
the
ten
day
period
of
rule
59.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it
is
dependent
upon
the
absence
in
rule
4
(b),
that
any
provision,
any
rule
of
statute
authorizing
petitions
for
the
hearing,
as
in
united
states
v.
healy.
that
is
what
differentiates
this
case
from
that
case.
the
argument
is
also
made,
that
rule
4
(a)
does
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus
cases.
the
contention
is
that
the
tolling
rules
of
4
(a)
are
in
direct
contravention
of
the
conformity
clause
of
civil
rule
81
(a)
(2).
but
if
we
look
at
the
predecessor
of
civil
rule
81
(a)
(2),
that
is
former
civil
rule
81
(b)
which
was
in
existence,
when
appealability,
when
the
time
to
appeal
a
set
by
the
civil
rules,
we
see
that
the
tolling
rule
from
the
civil
rules
were
expressly
and
fully
applicable
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
the
other
civil
rules
were
applicable
only
in
so
far
as
habeas
corpus
practice
that
confirm
to
practice
in
civil
cases,
but
the
civil
rules,
when
they
govern
appeals,
were
fully
applicable
to
appeals
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
so,
what
we
have
is
the
applicability
of
the
ten-day
tolling
time
unless
this
court
concludes
that
the
order
granting
the
petition
and
leaving
nothing
to
be
done,
but
to
appeal
or
to
execute
with
the
district
court
for
file
and
determine
was
not
the
final
order,
then
the
conclusion
we
have
is
that
the
motion
to
reconsider
was
untimely
and
that
the
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
untimely
motion
to
reconsider
did
not
vest
the
court
of
appeals
of
jurisdiction
to
review
the
merits
of
the
districts
court's
final
order,
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
the
district
court's
decision.
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
jurisdiction
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
clear
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
respondent
in
this
court
resolved
the
forth
amendment
questions
by
making
its
own
findings
of
fact
by
reading
the
testimony,
heard
by
the
district
judge
at
the
hearing
under
motion
to
reconsider
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
warden
who
is
the
loosing
party
in
the
district
court.
the
ordinary
rule
followed
by
courts
of
appeals
is
that
factual
questions
which
are
in
dispute,
which
were
in
dispute
are
resolved
on
appeal
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
support
the
judgment
entered.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
followed
that
view,
it
would
have
decided
the
probable
cause
question
in
this
case,
the
way
the
district
judge
had
decided
on
the
state
court
record.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
in
this
case
the
--
in
this
case
this
is
why
we
go
into
the
exceptions
of
stone
v.
powell,
the
legality
of
the
arrest,
the
question
is
relating
to
probable
cause
to
arrest
were
not
heard
and
decided
in
the
state
courts.
there
was
no
full
and
fair
adjudication
of
this
issue
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct,
but
when
they
has
not
been
an
adjudication
as
in
this
case
there
has
not
been,
i
think
stone
v.
powell
says
that
there
has
to
be
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
and
when
--
the
question
has
not
been
adjudicated,
i
think
full
and
fair
opportunity
has
to
be
read
together
with
wainwright
v.
sykes,
to
be
that
when
the
issue
was
not
raised
at
the
trial,
the
rule
that
has
to
be
applied
by
the
state
courts
to
the
determine
if
there
is
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
would
be
to
allow
the
prisoner
to
show
cause
for
why
it
was
not
raised
and
prejudice
resulting
from
default
of
trial
counsel.
that
is
the
--
what
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case.
before
he
adjudicated
the
the
fourth
amendment
question,
he
decided
whether
or
not
the
question
had
been
waived
by
the
failure
of
trial
counsel
to
have
raised
it
in
the
trial
court.
the
director
argued
that
this
question
should
be
resolved
in
the
state
court
record
in
favor
of
a
waiver
under
the
precedent
of
that
extent
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
judge
considered
that
question
and
found
that
under
that
case
which
adapted
standards
are
virtually
identical
to
those
adopted
by
this
court
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
but
the
question
did
not
waive
and
should
be
considered
in
federal
habeas
corpus
as
the
court
said
in
henry
v.
mississippi
when
it
made
clear
with
the
states
can
apply
any
procedural
waiver
rules
that
they
feel
are
appropriate,
but
that
if
they
nonetheless
refuse
to
adjudicate
a
constitutional
question,
it
is
open
to
the
federal
courts
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
procedural
rules
followed
by
the
state
courts
measured
up
to
federal
standards.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
would
have
read
it
exactly
the
same
way.
i
think
we
have
to
read
or
i
read
wainwright
v.
sykes
as
defining
what
opportunity
means.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
think
that
is
a
narrow
reading
of
wainwright
v.
sykes,
that
the
case
has
to
be
read
together
with
the
issues
decided
in
that
case,
it
was
defined
what
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
is.
in
this
case
as
in
wainwright
v.
sykes
he
had
opportunity
to
raise
the
constitutional
claim
at
the
trial.
it
was
not
raised,
in
this
case
we
did
not
have
any
opportunity
in
the
state
courts
to
show
that
there
was
cause,
but
why
it
was
not
raised
and
that
we
are
prejudiced
from
it
not
being
asserted.
i
think
if
those
two
cases
are
read
together
we
come
out
with
this
case
not
being
controlled
by
either
or
fourth
amendment
really
is
not
being
barred
by
either
stone
or
wainwright.
and
if
this
court
agrees
that
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction,
that
is
at
the
final
order
was
entered
in
october
21st
that
notice
of
appeal
was
untimely
with
that
order,
then
of
course
there
is
no
question
about
stone
and
about
wainwright.
this
case
would
have
reached
to
the
final
judgment
because
the
appeal
was
not
been
taken
and
there
has
been
no
contention
that
those
cases
should
apply
retroactively
to
cases
where
relief
had
been
granted
which
should
reach
to
the
final
judgment,
where
prisoner
had
been
enlarged,
virtually
enlarged.
as
the
court
of
appeals
resolved
the
probable
cause
question
which
is
the
way
that
the
respondent
will,
i
think
come
before
this
court
and
argue
the
probable
cause
question,
the
court
of
appeals
believe
that
the
police
officers
had
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
that
the
person
who
had
committed
a
crime
was
one
of
the
two
persons
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
permissible
for
the
police
to
enter
the
dwelling
at
night
without
a
warrant
and
arrest
both
of
these
persons,
even
when
the
offense
under
investigation
had
taken
place
two
days
before.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
at
6
p.m.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
it
was
a
january
day
which
i
think
we
can
acknowledge
was
night
time
in
chicago.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
we
are,
we
are
--
the
fourth
amendment
questions
are
three
fold.
perhaps
the
first
question
is
whether
it
was
lawful
for
the
search
of
the
dwelling
to
be
undertaken
in
the
absence
of
the
exigence
circumstances
without
a
search
warrant.
the
court
has
considered
that
question
and
has
refused
which
adjudicate.
with
the
client
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
it
is
our
position
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
whether
it
was
day
time
or
night
time,
but
in
this
case
it
was
night
time.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
in
this
case
it
was
night
time.
in
the
next
case
when
it
was
day
time
i
think
that
question
should
be
decided,
but
here
we
have
the
evil
in
its
most
of
vivacious
form,
which
is
night
time
entries
to
a
dwelling
and
if
that
reserve
question
is
to
be
decided
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh
it
is
different
in
degree,
but
it
is
still
night
time.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
consent
should
have
been
raised
by
the
director
in
the
district
court.
the
director
had
two
opportunities
to
show
that
the
arrest
was
lawful.
the
petition
squarely
put
an
issue,
the
illegality
of
the
search
based
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant.
mrs.
browder
was
in
a
district
court.
she
testified.
there
was
no
attempt
made
by
the
director
to
show
that
there
was
consent.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
record
shows
that
the
police
testified
that
she
said
that
record
also
shows
that
she
testified
and
denied
having
said
that.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
she
was
not
asked
about
that,
she
testified
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
did
she
deny
it?
well,
she
was
not
asked
to
deny
or
to
agree
with,
but
she
was
asked
what
happened.
she
said
“the
police
came
to
the
door.
i
asked
them
what
they
wanted.
they
said
we
are
here
for
your
sons.”
if
she
had
refused
to
allow
the
police
entry,
she
probably,
under
the
illinois
law,
would
have
been
arrested
for
refusing
to
assist
an
officer
in
discharging
his
duties.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
she
did
not
tell
them
do
not
come
in.
if
she
had
told
them
do
not
come
in,
she
could
have
been
arrested.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
okay
well,
the
record
was
not
made
on
this
point.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
duty
of
showing
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
is
borne
by
the
party
whose
trying
to
uphold
the
legality
of
the
search.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
state
court
record
shows,
what
i
have
just
answered
to
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
entry
was
forcible.
we
are
claiming
that
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
consent
that
is
shown
by
the
record
is
the
same
kind
of
consent
or
accession
to
official
demands
that
has
been
rejected
by
the
court
as
being
unknowing
and
voluntary
consent
to
entry.
in
this
case
the
police
officers
were
not
knocking
on
doors
asking
questions.
they
spent
the
day,
they
spent
the
evening
getting
together
to
go
out
browder
household
to
arrest
those
people.
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
these
police
officers
would
taken
no
for
an
answer,
when
they
arrive
at
the
browder's
residence
and
said
we
are
here,
to
get
your
sons
mrs.
browder.
there
were
four
officers
who
got
together
to
go
out
to
the
browder
household
to
arrest
the
people
there
to
find
out
which
one
would
be
identified.
the
police
officers
before
they
went
to
the
browder
household
knew
or
so
they
claim
knew
that
they
would
have
to
arrest
more
than
one
person
and
they
knew
that
they
would
be
making
an
arrest
to
investigation,
an
arrest
to
determine
whom
should
we
charge.
that
is
the
kind
of
powers
which
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
allow
police
officer
to
exercise
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
way
weary
davis
v.
mississippi
is
that
whenever
the
police
are
engaging
in
a
planed
investigative
series
of
arrests,
the
only
way,
the
only
conceivable
way
that,
that
could
be
authorized
would
be
if
it
had
been
previously
authorized
by
a
judicial
officer
under
one
of,
as
suggested
or
as
the
american
law
institute,
for
example,
read
davis
and
they
suggested
a
model
statute
allowing
limited
detentions.
in
this
case,
the
police
decided
or
suspected
that
the
person
they
were
seeking
might
be
one
of
the
persons
in
that
room,
in
that
dwelling
and
they
went
and
seized
all
of
them.
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant.
they
knew
they
will
be
seeking,
they
will
be
seizing
more
than
one
person
and
that
power,
the
power
to
arrest
to
clear
up
an
investigation
is
a
power
which
strikes
at
the
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no
i
would
not
concede.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
what
i
mean
is
that
everything
the
police
knew
on
january
29th
when
they
went
to
the
browder
household,
they
knew,
they
knew
two
days
before
when
the
rape
was
reported.
they
knew,
if
they
did
know
that
the
offender
itself
was
a
teenager
named
browder
from
that
block.
they
knew
that
day
right
after
the
rape
and
they
waited
two
days
before
deciding
to
act
on
that.
they
could
have
done
further
investigation
in
those
two
days.
they
could
have
shown
photographs
to
the
rape
victim.
they
could
have
gone
to
a
prosecutor,
confront
to
him
with
their
problems
and
what
should
we
do?
we
think
its
one
of
several
people,
should
we
go
arrest
them
all?
should
we
get
a
warrant?
should
this
be
turned
over
to
the
grand
jury
or
some
these
people
down,
have
the
rape
victim
look
at
them?
they
need
to
any
of
those
things.
they
had
ample
time
to
do
something
other
than
to
get
together
one
evening
and
go
out
and
arrest
everybody
there.
so
we
do
not
concede
that
under
those
circumstances
it
is
reasonable,
it
is
lawful
for
the
police
to
make
a
warrantless
arrest
of
four
people
with
the
expectation
or
in
the
hope
that
one
of
them
would
be
identified.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
they
were
two
teenagers
who
said
their
name
was
browder.
there
were
two
other
teenagers
who
said
that
their
names
were
not
browder,
but
the
police
may
have
suspected
that
they
were
lying.
they
were
there
to
arrest
the
teenage
browder
like
16,
17,
18,
19.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
they
admitted
to
being
browders.
there
were
two
other
teenagers
said
they
were,
that
their
name
was
not
browder,
but
the
police
officers
did
not
believe
two
browders
and
they
said
did
you
commit
the
rape
and
they
very
well
might
not
have
believed
the
two
other
teenagers,
and
they
said
our
last
name
is
not
browder.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it
is
conceded.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
would
be
making
same
argument
in
addition
to
others,
but
at
the
time
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
the
police
knew
at
the
time
they
entered
the
browder
residence
to
make
the
arrest
and
if
they
had
gone
to
a
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
would
be
arguing
that
they
lacked
sufficient
probable
cause
to
arrest
anyone
based
on
what
they
knew.
they
had
enough
information
to
get
a
general
warrant
to
search
the
4000
block
of
monroe
street.
they
did
not
know
that
this
browder
family
was
the
only
browder
family
who
lives
in
this
block.
they
made
no
attempt
to
determine
if
there
were
other
teenage
browders.
if
for
example
there
had
been
three
browder
families
each
with
five
teenage
sons,
this
quantum
of
information
would
have
allowed
the
arrest
of
15
people.
the
police
simply
did
not
do
enough
in
this
case
to
narrow
the
focus
to
any
identifiable
person.
the
only
warrant
they
could
have
gotten,
the
only
arrest
warrant
they
could
have
gotten
would
have
been
a
general
warrant,
that
simply
is
not
enough.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
would
be
sufficient
to
go
arrest
them.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
the
first
difference.
what
you
are
saying
is
correct.
there
is
another
distinction
in
that
once
the
police
got
there,
they
found
there
were
several
people
who
matched
that
description.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
they
would
have
probable
cause
to
go
out
and
arrest
a
browder.
once
they
found
this
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
once
they
found
that
there
was
more
than
one
person
who
matched
that
description
who
lived
at
that
address
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh!
i
am
not
saying
you
cannot
do
anything.
what
you
cannot
do
is
arrest
both
of
them
to
find
out
which
one--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
think
you
first
have
to
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
we
first,
police
first
have
to
make
it
a
determination
because
anything
could
have
happened
if
you
do
not
have
prompt.
if
they
believe
that
both
people
are
going
to
flee
then
we
have
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here.
here
we
have
the
police
going
ahead,
finding
out
there
are
two
people--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
they
have
to
make
that
first
decision,
i
think
both
are
going
flee
if
they
do
not
do
any
thing.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
they
make
determination,
nothing
is
going
to
happen,
if
we
do
not
do
anything,
that
both
of
these
people
are
upstanding
over
the
community,
they
are
not
going
to
leave,
then
the
police
cannot
arrest
them.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
in
that
hypothetical,
i
think
the
police
could
arrest
both.
the
problem
would
be
the
search
warrant
question
it
would
be
reasonable
to
enter,
it
would
it
be
lawful
to
enter
a
dwelling
to
arrest
both
of
them
and
we
would
still
argue
you
need
a
warrant
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
they
have
probable
cause
to
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
this
court
is
held
that
the
warrant
is
needed
in
that
situation,
answer
would
be
yes,
under
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
they
were
both
in
a
public
place
and
they
both
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
they
were
in
the
doorway,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
our
argument,
a
warrant
needed
to
enter.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no
i
do
not
think
the
court
must
reach.
mr.
browder
would
be
happy
with
the
reinstatement
of
the
petition
of
the
writ
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
primary
argument,
i
have
been
listening
to
is
that
the
state
or
the
director
did
not
have
time
to
get
together
its
motion
to
reconsider
within
28
days.
the
motion
that
was
filed
in
opposition
to
the
petition
was
not
really
a
motion
to
dismiss,
it
was
motion
for
summary
judgment.
it
was
based
on
facts
set
out
in
the
state
court
record,
that
will
be
forwarded
to
district
judge
and
it
relied
on
those
facts.
it
was
in
our
memorandum
file
in
support
of
the
petition
we
suggested
that
it
would
not
be
inappropriate,
if
the
district
judge
so
desired
to
allow
an
evidentiary
hearing
for
the
director
to
show
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
for
arrest.
if
the
director
came
in
within
10
days
and
said
judge
you
did
not
hold
the
evidentiary
hearing,
you
should
have
held
one,
even
the
petitioner
thinks
that
you
should
have
held
one,
we
probably
would
have
been
estopped
to
dispute
that
and
the
hearing
would
have
been
held.
rather
than
coming
within
10
days
there
is
this
28
day
delay.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
it
had
been,
regardless
of
how
it
was
labeled
if
the
district
judge
construed
it
as
a
rule
59
motion
it
would
have
tolled
the
time
to
appeal.
if
it
had
been
a
rule
60
(b)
motion
which
could
be
filed
any
time
after
the
notice
of
appeal
should
have
been
filed
without
tolling
the
time
to
appeal
then
there
would
be
the
standard
for
review
from
the
denial
of
that
motion
would
be
right
over
if
the
district
judge
had
abused
his
discretion
in
refusing
to
modify
his
earlier
order
and
there
is
no
abuse
of
discretion
here,
evidence
before
the
district
judge
in
hearing
the
motion
to
reconsider
was
contradictory.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
what
we
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
motion
should
be
viewed,
as
this
appeal
should
be
viewed
as
an
appeal
for
the
denial
of
rule
60
(b)
relief.
the
director
conceded
or
represented
an
urge
to
court
of
appeals
not
to
view
it
as
a
rule
60
(b)
appeal
and
has
urged
this
court
not
to
do
so.
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
go
back
and
re
construe
the
case
if
it
had
been
an
appeal
for
denial
of
rule
60
(b)
relief.
even
if
it
had
been
though,
the
result
necessarily
would
have
been
that
the
district
judge
should
have
been
referred
just
to
ample
contradictions
to
support
his
refusal
to
modify
his
earlier
order.
the
argument
that
rule
59
is
not
applied
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
overlooks
what
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
getting
out
in
his
question
as
to
how
do
we
tell
which
civil
rules
apply.
we
can
tell
that
when
it
is
not
explicitly
said
by
looking
at
former
practice
and
saying
if
former
practice
in
civil
cases
confirm
to
practice
in
habeas
corpus
cases
and
indeed
it
did
as
we
may
clear
in
the
two
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
at
footnote
at
page
21.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you.
