you
would
not
be
making
this
argument
except
that
this
was
a
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
say
this
kind
of
a
petition
would
be
out
of
time
in
a
non
habeas
corpus
civil
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
do
say,
you
should
pay
no
attention
to
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
now
asking
about
a
non
habeas
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
kind
of
petition
would
be
out
of
time
in
a
regular
civil
case,
a
non
habeas
corpus
case,
that
is
the
motion
to
reconsider?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
,is
not
there
yes
or
no,
that
is
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
makes
you
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
healy
never
said
that
their
petition
for
--
an
out
of
time
petition
for
re-consideration
would
extend
the
time
for
a
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
of
the
cases
that
in
which
you
have
relied
said
that?
