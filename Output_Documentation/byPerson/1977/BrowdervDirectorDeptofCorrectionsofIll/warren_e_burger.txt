chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-5325,
browder
against
illinois.
mr.
flaxman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
reach
that
and
decide
it
we
need
not
decide
any
other
questions,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
consent
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
the
state
court
record
show
about
the
consent
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
shows
no
claim
of
a
forcible
entry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
shows
on
the
contrary,
that
the
police
testimony
was
she
consented
to
their
entry
and
permitted
them
to
enter
the
house,
that
is
not
disputed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
flaxman.
mr.
mckoski?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
the
argument
you
were
making
at
the
outset
is
that
for
all
practical
purposes
a
habeas
corpus
case
is
a
criminal
matter
and
should
be
viewed
in
criminal
context,
just
as
congress
has
viewed
it
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
justice
act
and
you
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
try
to
give
this
unlimited
discretion
to
each
district
judge,
to
fix
time
limits
of
his
own
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
before
had
this
trial
taken
place
of
these
events
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
any
thing
further
mr.
flaxman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
mr.
flaxman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-5325
browder
against
illinois
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
