mr.
raymond
mckoski
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
issue
of
the
arrest,
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
the
nature
of
entry.
i
will
keep
my
remarks
very
limited
in
this
regard.
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
the
police
knew,
when
they
went
to
the
browder
residence.
on
january
29,
they
found
out
from
the
victim
of
the
rape
that
her
assailant
was
the
brother
of
a
person,
the
victim
went
to
school
with.
she
knew
that
he
was
dark
complexed,
male
negro
in
his
late
teens,
approximately
seventeen
years
of
old,
17
years
of
age,
his
last
name
was
browder
and
he
lived
in
4000
west
block
of
west
monroe.
she
narrowed
it
down
to
one
block.
this
information
was
received
on
january
29
by
a
homicide
investigator
stan
thomas.
it
was
not
until
the
31st
of
january,
two
days
later
that
mr.
thomas
conveyed
this
information
to
the
juvenile
authorities,
who
then
went
out
and
arrested
him.
on
january
31st,
the
juvenile
officers
received
the
information
about
4:00-4:30
in
the
afternoon
and
had
made
the
arrest
by
six
at
night.
in
that
intertwining
time
they
had
located
a
browder
family
on
the
block,
they
have
located
a
juvenile
record
on
one
tyrone
browder,
who
lived
at
40,53
west
monroe.
they
had
personally
interviewed
the
victim
of
rape
themselves
to
verify
the
information
that
mr.
stan
thomas
gave
them.
they
also
called
for
a
back
up
squad.
at
six
o
clock
they
proceeded
to
the
house.
one
of
the
thing
i
forgot
that
is
very
important.
before
they
went
to
the
house
the
juvenile
officer
who
was
heading
the
investigation
called
the
browder
residence
and
talked
with
the
mother
of
tyrone
and
then
ben
browder.
he
asked
her
if
the
sons
were
home
and
she
said
yes
and
he
said
would
you
mind
keeping
them
there
and
until
we
get
there.
the
police
then
got
into
the
car
and
went
over
to
the
browder's
residence.
in
this
time,
mrs.
browder
had
an
opportunity
to
think
over
what
she
wanted
to
do
when
police
came
there,
she
wanted
to
change
her
mind
since
the
phone
conversation.
the
police
arrived,
knocked
on
the
door,
mrs.
browder
opened
the
door
and
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers,
invited
them
in.
they
went
in,
no
search
was
conducted,
the
arrest
was
made,
miranda
warnings
were
given
and
the
four
gentlemen
were
taken
to
the
police
station.
now
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
real
explanation
--
i
am
not
hesitant
to
conceive
that
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
the
four
arrested,
but
i
think
what
really
happened
in
that
context
and
the
juvenile
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
investing
so
testified,
they
went
to
the
house,
they
knew
two
browder's
would
be
there
and
they
arrested
both
browders
because
they
both
fit
the
description.
they
were
two
other
young
teenage
black
males
there.
the
police
knew
that
there
was
second
assailant
sharon
alexander
was
raped
by
a
man
named
browder,
but
there
was
also
another
assailant
with
browder
at
the
time
who
also
raped
her.
and
so
mr.
conright
(ph)
testified
that
he
thought
that
may
be
one
of
the
other
two
could
have
been
the
second
assailant
and
that
is
why
he
asked
the
other
two
if
they
would
go
along
to
the
police
station
to
stand
in
line
up.
mr.
conright
testified,
they
volunteered
to
go
with
and
that
was
how
description
of
the
events
ended.
once
at
the
police
station,
arrest
slips
were
filled
out
for
all
four
youths,
so
i
think
that
they
were
arrested,
at
any
event
arrested
at
the
police
station,
when
the
arrest
slips
were
filled
up.
i
do
not
believe
mr.
conright
thought
that
he
was
arresting
them
at
the
time
at
the
house,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
really
important.
i
think
the
important
point
there
is,
not
withstanding
what
mr.
flaxman
said,
they
were
not
arresting
all
four
because
they
thought
one
of
the
four
was
a
browder.
they
knew
who
the
two
browders
were.
the
mother
introduced
the
police
officers
to
the
two
browders.
it
was
the
other
person
the
second
assailant
they
thought
might
be
there.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
there
was
probable
cause
like
the
seventh
circuit
held
at
the
warrantless
entry,
that
warrant
was
not
necessary
for
the
entry
because
the
entry
was
consented
to
and
even
if
not
consented
to,
it
was
acknowledged
by
mrs.
browder.
we
also
argue
that
in
any
event
a
warrant
is
not
necessary
to
enter
a
private
dwelling
to
effectuate
an
arrest
and
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that
a
little
bit
if
i
could.
i
do
feel
compelled
first
though
to
address
just
very
briefly
mr.
flaxman's
initial
argument
and
that
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
had
jurisdiction
to
even
consider
this
case.
there
is
dispute
as
to
what
was
the
final
order,
but
right
now
i
do
not
want
to
concede,
but
i
am
willing
to
assume,
october
21st
1975
was
a
final
order.
that
order
was
a
minute
order
and
a
memorandum
opinion,
that
was
filed
after
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
petition
was
filed,
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
by
the
petitioner
--
by
the
respondent
and
then
later
district
court
granted
the
writ
and
impliedly
denied
the
motion
of
dismissal
though
that
was
never
specifically
stated.
28
days
after
the
writ
was
issued
with
a
stay
of
60
days
to
retry
to
petitioner.
the
respondent
filed
a
motion,
it
was
entitled
motion
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
it
was
respondent's
position
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
the
exception
of
one
statement
in
the
motion
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
said
that
upon
investigation
the
respondent
feels
that
one
may
reasonably
conclude
that
there
was
probable
cause.
it
is
sort
of
an
innocuous
statement,
but
what
the
purpose
of
the
statement
was
that
this
case
was
an
old
case.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
suppose
you
could
phrase
it
that
way
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no
your
honor,
it
was
not
what
the
law
was.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
problem
that
the
respondent
faced
was
to
find
out
if
there
were
in
fact,
facts
to
present
to
district
court
that
they
were
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
right.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
director,
the
warden,
the
director
of
illinois
department
of
correction
nor
his
attorney,
the
attorney
general
had
any
idea
on
whether
or
not
there
really
were
other
facts
presented
in
the
record
to
establish
probable
cause.
it
has
never
been
litigated.
i
certainly
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
hope
not
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
because
he
did
know
that
those
facts
existed.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
because
he
did
not
know
that
miss.
sharron
alexander
gave
a
description
to
the
police
officers.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
he
did
not
have
the
facts,
they
were
never
litigated.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
not
just
merely
refile
a
motion.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no,
i
do
not
think
that
law
should
be
changed
in
that
regard
your
honor
but
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
have
an
explanation
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
attorney
general's
office
as
in
all
habeus
corpus
cases,
receives
a
copy
of
the
petition,
for
a
writ
of
habeus
corpus.
the
attorney
assigned
to
the
case,
reviews
the
petition.
if
he
thinks
a
motion
or
dismiss
would
be
in
order,
he
writes
a
motion
to
dismiss,
basically
assuming
what
petitioner
said
is
true,
it
has
not
stated
the
claim,
files
that,
without
any
factual
investigation
because
none
is
necessary
for
a
motion
to
dismisses.
the
motion
to
dismisses
rule
that.
if
it
is
denied,
usually
the
district
court
judge
gives
the
respondent
10
days
or
20
days
to
file
any
answer,
response
of
pleading.
in
this
case
no
such
opportunity
was
given.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
in
effect
was
denied,
the
writ
granted.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
my
first
point
your
honor
is
that
the
attorney
general,
the
representative
of
the
respondent
needed
time
to
do
a
factual
investigation,
the
case
is
five
years
old.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well,
your
honor
they
were
overworked,
when
i
was
there
and
they
still
are,
but
i
certainly
do
not
rely
on
that
fact,
whatsoever.
the
fact
i
rely
on,
and
that
it
takes
time
to
do
investigation,
a
factual
investigation
of
a
case
five
years
old,
some
of
the
police
officers
are
no
longer
with
the
force
and
some
cannot
even
be
located
to
testify
at
the
hearing.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
record
unfortunately
did
not
go
into
the
circumstances
around
the
arrest
because
it
probable
cause
issue
was
not
litigated.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
could
have
been
done
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well,
i
do
not
think,
the
issue
would
have
probably
still
been
raised.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
right
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
in
habeas
cases,
number
one
the
federal
rules,
civil
rules
of
procedure
do
not
apply
across
the
board
and
its
basically
at
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
whether
to
apply
them
or
not.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
yes
your
honor
because
traditionally
and
by
practice
in
the
federal
courts,
a
motion
to
reconsidered
is
timely
filed,
if
it
is
filed
within
the
30-day
period
for
appeal.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
i
am
talking
about
basically
united
states
v.
dieter
and
united
states
v.
healy.
that
those
cases
held
that
a
motion
to
reconsider
traditionally
in
civil
and
criminal
practice
is
timely
filed,
if
filed
within
30
days.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
it
was
filed
under
the
rights
under
the
habeas
corpus
act.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well
your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that
60
(b)
could
be
applied
here
in
our
favor.
i
think
it
would
be
applicable,
but
we
do
not
make
that
argument
and
i
cannot
say
that
we
made
the
argument,
and
we
did
not.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
respondent
is
left
on
argument
that
clearly
settles
the
issue
that
the
court
would
probably
or
should
probably,
if
i
can
be
so
bold,
use
the
argument
that
the
respondent
did
not
raise
if
in
fact
law
ans
justice
required
as
the
habeas
corpus
act
requires
these
petitions
to
be
disposed
in
accordance
with.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
rule
59
talks
about
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
we
never
had
a
trial.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
our
basic
argument
is
that
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
can
be
applied
by
a
district
judge
when
he
feels
appropriate,
when
they
are
in
line
with
disposing
of
a
petition
as
law
and
justice
requires.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
right
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
supported
by
the
new
rules
govern
in
habeas
procedures
and
has
always
been
in
effect,
exercised
by
the
courts.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
it
is
in
the
district
court's
discretion.
if
he
feels
that
a
rule
is
applicable
then
he
can
apply
that
and
if
he
does
not
abuse
his
discretion,
it
cannot
be
disturbed.
it
is
for
him
to
determine
what
rules
are
appropriate
to
be
applied.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
when
an
order
was
entered
that
disposed
of
the
facts,
that
disposed
of
the
case,
granted
relief
to
one
party
or
the
other,
than
that
order
would
be
appealable
for
a
period
of
up
to
30
days,
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
think
that
it
would
be
in
the
same
way
that
the
united
states
v.
dieter
or
u.s.
v.
healy
was
handled.
we
have
one
motion
to
reconsider
has
been
allowed
traditionally
and
by
practice.
when
you
have
that
one
motion,
however,
it
is
disposed
off,
you
have
30
days
from
that
time
to
appeal.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
leave
what
up
to
each
judge,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
10-day
rule
should
be
applicable
to
habeas
cases
because
of
their
unique
nature.
there
may
be
some
circumstances
when
they
are.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
rule
that
has
traditionally
been
followed
in
practice
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
throughout
the
country
in
federal
courts.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
civil
and
criminal
cases;
united
states
v.
healy
rules.
we
have
30
days
to
file
a
motion
to
reconsider
and
30
days
from
the
date
of
the
disposition
of
motion
to
appeal.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
right
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
it
was
a
mistake?
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
mistake.
i
think
it
has
a
place
in
talking
about
normal
civil
suits.
i
think,also,
that
if
district
court
judge
could
apply
it
if
he
wanted,
if
he
thought
that
was
appropriate,
but
i
think
if
he
does
not
apply
it,
he
has
that
right
and
only
if
he
abuses
his
discretion
in
not
applying
it,
is
there
a
problem.
i
think
it
is
in
the
trial
court's
discretion
as
other
civil
rules
of
federal
procedure.
the
district
judge
chose
not
to
apply
it
in
this
case
and
i
think
his
reasons
for
not
applying
are
all
sound.
the
issue
had
never
been
litigated,
and
the
state
was
making
claim
that
they
had
probable
cause.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
if
it
was
–
well,
there
may
be
other
unique
kinds
of
proceedings
that
should
not
be
governed
all
the
time
by
federal
law.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
our
petition
to
reconsider?
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
think
still
it
could
timely
filed
within
30
days
in
a
normal
civil
suit
under
dieter
and
healy.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
well,
i
say
that
you
should
pay
no
attention
to
it
in
the
habeas
case
if
the
district
court
judge
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
okay.
in
a
non
habeas
case
i
think
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
should
apply
strictly
to
those
cases.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
my
reading
of
healy
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
am
happy
to
say
that
this
kind
of
motion
would
be
out
of
time,
but
i
think
that
opinion
in
my
opinion,
their
might
be
conflict
with
healy.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
because
healy
and
dieter
say
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
if
it
does
not...
mr.
raymond
mckoski
if
it
does
not
your
honor
then
i
am
mistaken
and
i
apologize,
but
that
was
my
reading
in
the
case
also.
dieter,
i
think,
both
of
those
appeals
were
filed
after
30
days
of
the
original
order.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
dieter
says
that
a
petition
for
re-hearing
has
been
traditionally
considered
timely
filed
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
if
within
a
30
days.
dieter
was
not
a
civil
case.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
do
not
know
of
any
cases
your
honor,
of
civil
cases,
considering
a
motion
to
reconsider.
i
do
not
know
them
and
that
is
why
i
am
saying
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
rules
of
the
civil
procedure
should
apply
strictly
in
normal
civil
cases.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
what
case
was
that
your
honor?
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no,
your
honor
i
have
not.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
and
i
apologize
to
the
court,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
a
habeas
case
underlying
at
is
solely
criminal
issues
and
it
arises
from
a
criminal
case.
i
am
afraid
that,
being
as
director
as
i
can
i
got
into
trouble
with
the
civil,
talking
about
normal
civil
cases.
i
am
happy
to
say
that,
without
exception,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
should
apply
in
civil
cases.
i
only
mentioned
that
i
thought
it
might
conflict
with
dieter
because
of
the
word
civil
in
there
in
criminal.
i
am
happy
to
withdraw
that
and
i
think
habeas
cases
are
special.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
there
is
provision
in
a
criminal
case.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor
i
did
not
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
yes,
he
can.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
think
that
the
basis
of
dieter
was
that
--
based
on
tradition
and
history,
i
mean,
besides
tradition
and
history,
that
it
was
the
most
economical
way
to
adjudicate
the
issues
and
i
think
that
same
rationale
that
applies
here.
to
give
a
respondent
10
days
to
move
for
some
kind
of
relief
after
his
motion
to
dismiss
has
been
denied
and
nothing
else
has
been
stated
on
the
case,
i
think,
provides
a
burden
on
him
that
is
very
hard
to
comply
with
that,
any
time
you
are
talking
about
habeas
cases.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
when
you
go
through
a
long
trial,
at
least
you
know
what
the
facts
of
the
case
were.
when
our
motion
was
dismissed,
it
was
denied
here,
we
did
not
know
what
the
facts
the
police
officers
had
in
their
possession,
in
a
case
that
was
five
years
old
and
we
literally
tracked
down
people.
it
was
not
a
matter
of
office
work,
going
through
voluminous
record
or
checking
the
amendments
for
what
happened
in
the
trial.
in
a
case
that
you
like
describe
your
honor,
at
least
you
know
the
facts,
here
we
do
not
even
know
what
the
facts
were
and
had
to
scale
them
up.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
it
is
august
of
1971.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
i
believe
that
it
was
three
days.
i
think
it
was,
two
or
three
days.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
it
is
not
very
long,
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
the
problem
--
mr.
raymond
mckoski
yes,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
the
record
included
absolutely
nothing
on
a
probable
cause
issue,
and
we
had
to
go
outside
the
record
to
locate
witnesses
around
the
city
of
chicago.
i
would
also
like
to
mention
too
in
passing
on
this
that
if
the
civil
rules
of
federal
procedure
do
apply,
then
the
rules
were
violated
by
the
district
court,
by
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
with
only
our
motion
to
dismiss
pending.
certainly
in
any
other
kind
of
civil
case
where
there
was
federal
civil
procedure
apply,
motion
to
dismiss,
the
case
cannot
be
decided
on
the
merits
with
only
a
motion
to
dismiss
pending.
he
did
not
consider
it
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
petitioner
did
not
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
only
thing
that
we
had
pending
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
where
we
admitted
everything
the
petitioner
said
and
said
he
did
not
state
a
claim.
we
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
if
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied.
the
trial
judge
did
not
give
us
that
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
he
did
not
give
us
a
chance
to
answer
whatever
the
provision
is,
ten
or
fifteen
or
twenty
days
to
file
an
answer.
mr.
raymond
mckoski
that
is
right
your
honor.
to
raise
that
by
appeal
though
was
just
too
big.
extended
litigation
over
years
we
would
have
went
up
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
ask
for
a
hearing
they
would
have
given
us
a
hearing,
hopefully.
we
would
then
go
back
down
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
would
have
founds
no
rule
probable
causes
which
make
up
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
would
have
found
probable
cause
if
they
stuck
to
their
original
decision
and
it
would
have
just
taken
couple
of
more
years.
it
certainly
saves
a
lot
of
time
and
i
think
that
was
the
part
of
the
reason
in
dieter,
to
ask
right
in
there
in
the
district
court
for
the
hearing
a
void
when
appealed.
i
would
like
to
ask
for
brief
speak
--
speak
briefly
if
i
might
citing
the
stone
v.
powell
issue
and
wainwright
v.
sykes
issue.
assuming
that,
i
am
sorry,
it
is
our
contention
basically
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
not
cognizable
in
a
habeas
case.
and
even
if
it
is
cognizable
the
defendant
has,
the
petitioner
has
an
in
fact
waived
his
right
to
present
that
issue
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
because
he
did
not
object
the
entry
of
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
unlawful
arrest.
stone
v.
powell
requires
an
opportunity,
the
state
gives
an
opportunity
for
a
petitioner
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
the
state
of
illinois
provide
such
a
procedure.
a
motion
of
suppress
of
evidence
can
be
made
before
trial.
the
facts
were
not
known
at
trial.
this
opportunity
provided
by
the
illinois
statutes
safeguards
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
was
the
main
concern
in
stone
v.
powell.
simply
put,
as
long
as
the
police
know
that
illegal
seized
evidence
can
be
suppressed
or
will
be
suppressed
by
a
state
court
there
is
no
incentive
for
them
to
disregard
the
fourth
amendment.
in
fact,
there
is
a
deterrent
because
illegally
seized
evidence
will
not
be
allowed.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
in
trial
court,
the
petitioner
here
did
not
choose
to
challenge
the
evidence
in
the
state
court,
does
not
detract
from
the
effectiveness
of
the
illinois
procedures
in
the
deterring
police
conduct.
it
would
only
have
an
effect
under
deterrence
if
we
could
assume
that
a
police
officer
will
think,
well,
i
can
seize
this
evidence
illegally
because
the
defendant's
attorney
probably
would
not
raise
the
issue.
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
a
valid
assumption.
the
state
did
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
opportunity,
petitioner
had
in
state
court
to
present
his
issue.
there
was
an
opportunity.
the
defendant
did
not
take
it,
take
advantage
of
opportunity,
but
it
was
there,
and
therefore,
this
purely
fourth
amendment
claim
is
not
cognizable.
if
it
was
cognizable,
if
it
is
cognizable
the
defendant
did
not
raise
the
issue
in
the
trial
court.
he
did
not
raise
the
arrest
issue
on
a
motion
of
suppress.
he
did
the
arrest
issue
at
trial
using
it
to
show
that
the
police
officers
really
did
not
know
whether
they
were
arresting
that
there
was
no
warrant
before
arrest
and
investigation
of
rape,
using
it
to
show
to
jury
that
the
police
were
not
sure
who
committed
the
crime,
and
therefore,
the
jury
should
not
be
sure
who
committed
the
crime.
the
petitioner's
trial
counsel
knew
the
factual
basis
for
an
arrest
claim.
he
filed
motions
under
the
contemporary
subjection
rule
so
he
is
aware
of
that.
in
fact,
his
efforts
helped
secure
the
petitioner's
acquittal
on
the
armed
robbery
charge,
although
he
was
convicted
of
rape.
it
was
no
challenge
that
he
was
competent.
simply
the
petitioner
is
not
shown
cause
why
his
failure
to
object
in
trial
court
should
be
excused.
also
important
here
is
the
reliability
of
the
evidence.
the
inquiry
identification
was
from
an
independent
source,
not
the
arrest.
the
district
court
and
trial
court
held
that.
the
confession
was
purely
voluntary.
it
was
a
volunteered
statement
after
two
eye
witnesses
identified
the
defendant
in
a
line
up.
he
admitted
to
one,
denied
the
other.
he
called
the
police
officer
over
to
speak
to
them,
no
interrogation
whatsoever.
each
statement
was
only
a
couple
minutes
long.
miranda
warnings
were
given
three
times.
in
short
it
is
our
position
that
issue
is
not
cognizable.
secondly
wainwright
v.
sykes
application
to
that
rule
or
at
least
one
result
that
he
waived
the
because
there
was
no
cause
and
there
was
no
prejudice
from
the
alleged
constitutional
violation.
thank
you
very
much.
