justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
in
affect
that
the
judgment
is
to
the
invalidity
that
state
conviction
was
final
and
the
state
was
just
given
a
couple
alternatives
as
what
to
do
in
consequence
of
that
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
flaxman,
the
respondent's
brief,
places
some
way
down
a
decision
of
this
court
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
united
states
against
dieter
which
involved
a
criminal
prosecution
rather
than
a
civil
one
and
i
do
not
know
if
you
filed
a
reply
brief
or
not,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
distinguish
dieter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
dieter
and
entirely
dependant
on
provisions
of
the
rules?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court's
freedom
defined
facts
is
somewhat
limited
by
the
66
amendment
to
the
habeas
corpus
act
though,
is
not
it,
if
there
has
been
a
state
court
record
made
on
the
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
stone
against
powell
says
if
you
had
opportunity
to
make
the
claim,
it
does
not
say
there
has
be
an
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
wainwright
v.
sykes
did
not
deal
any
fourth
amendment
problem
which
stone
v.
powell
did
deal
with.
i
would
have
read
stone
v.
powell
to
preclude
review
on
habeas
corpus
if
there
had
been
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question
without
regard
to
the
cause
and
prejudice
requirements
of
wainwright
against
sykes
in
other
types
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
it
is
for
right
of
counsel
types
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
or
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
test
for
knowing
whether
or
not
a
particular
rule
of
civil
procedure
applies
in
a
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
will
never
know
when
they
think
it
is
appealable.
the
whole
purpose
of
rules
in
civil
procedure
is
to
fix
deadlines
and
let
people
know
when
the
case
is
over,
when
it
is
finally
addressed
if
no
notice
of
appeal
has
been
filed.
your
system
would
just
leave
the
whole
thing
up
in
the
air,
would
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
dieter
was
a
criminal
case
where
you
do
not
have
the
counter
part
of
rule
59?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
after
his
motion
to
dismiss
denied,
but
actually
the
10-day
period
contemplates
the
motion
to
be
made
after
a
trial
also,
which
is
much
more
burdensome
thing.
you
try
a
six
months
case
and
figure
you
got
to
in
within
10
days
and
file
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment,
and
i
think
you
have
got
a
much
bigger
problem
than
you
do
in
your
typical
ruling
of
law
type
of
thing,
hits
your
head
here
without
any
evidence
taken?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
something
you
would
ordinarily
raise
by
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
motion
instead
of
being
denominated
and
the
motion
old
remand
had
been
denominate,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
base
of
newly
discovered
evidence
under
rule
60,
in
the
same
time
sequence
it
obtained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
least
there
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeal?
