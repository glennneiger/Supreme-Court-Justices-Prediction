justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
have
happened
if
the
state
had
made
that
motion
one
day
after
the
original
order
was
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
explain
why
they
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
not
the
record
show
that
she
told
him
that
she
thought
one
of
them
was
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
she
deny
having
admitted
it
freely?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
did
she
deny
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
she
tell
them,
do
not
come
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
interesting,
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
victim
says,
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
against
me,
his
name
is
browder
and
he
lives
at
a
particular
number
on
a
particular
street.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
go
and
arrest
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
difference
is
that
they
did
not
give
them
the
specific
number?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
my
point
was,
but
he
could
have
arrested
a
browder?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
did
arrest
two
browders?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
a
man
says
that
the
guy
that
killed
me
his
name
is
jones
and
he
lives
at
213
m.
street
and
you
go
to
213
m.
street,
you
find
two
people
named
jones,
you
cannot
do
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do
in
that
situation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
find
two
people
who
said
my
name
is
jones?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
they
do
when
two
people
say
my
name
is
jones?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assume
it
both
ways?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
say
nothing
about
the
upstanding
members
of
the
community.
how
do
you
know
whether
man
is
going
to
flee
or
not?
i
assume,
if
you
come
and
say
you
are
looking
for
man
name
jones
who
have
committed
murder,
so
that
you
can
arrest
him
and
convict
him,
the
chances
are
he
might
leave,
which
one
of
them
would
you
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one
would
you
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
line
of
our
cases,
if
they
came
to
a
doorway
and
caught
that
someone
could
they
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
came
to
the
doorway,
could
they
have
arrested
them
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
could
arrested
both
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
in
the
doorway
of
their
own
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
would
be
then
what
inside
the
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
why
it
took
you
28
days
to
find
out
what
the
law
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
newly
discovered
evidence,
what
the
law
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
was
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
facts
were
what
you
presented,
your
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
were
in
your
control,
and
that
is
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
newly
discover
your
own
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not
they
litigate
originally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
represented
the
state
in
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
that
is
why
i
thought
that
was
it.
well,
was
he
incompetent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
not
he
put
this
in
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
he
did
not
know
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
not
have
the
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
had
to
view
the
police
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
we
have
to
change
the
rules
to
take
care
of
somebody
that
do
not
know
how
to
try
a
law
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
no
explanation
for
waiting
28
days
to
file
a
motion
which
should
have
been
filed
immediately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
am
waiting
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
state's
lawyer
ask
for
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
complaining
about,
on
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
left
that
one
very
important
point.
the
attorney
general's
office
is
very
over
worked,
you
left
that
one
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
record
was
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
do
not
rely
on
rule
60
(b),
will
you
state
as
shortly
as
you
can
on
how
you
avoid
the
10-day
requirement
of
rule
59?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
when
if
the
petitioner
loses
for
failure
to
put
up
evidence,
he
could,
28
days
later,
come
in
and
say
i
have
got
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could?
then
could
he
come
in
after
at
another
30
days.
when
would
your
time
limit
take
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
surely
you
agree
at
some
time
it
has
got
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
apply
to
all
the
charges
in
that
circuit
and
would
apply
to
the
next
circuit?
you
leave
up
to
this
each
court?
would
you
leave
up
to
each
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
to
when
or
not,
he
is
going
to
ignore
the
10-day
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
up
to
each
judge,
but
why
not
do
away
with
the
10-day
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
rule
was
it,
the
rule
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
civil
and
criminal
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
10-say
will
drop?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
--
just
a
mistake?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
long
was
the
trail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
you
as
a
lawyer
to
go
over
three
day
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
will
be
less
than
ten
days,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
will
be
less
than
ten,
would
it
not?
