justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
a
illinois
court
of
rape.
after
exhausting
state
remedies
he
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
in
the
federal
district
court
in
illinois.
that
court
held
that
petitioner
had
been
arrested
without
probable
cause
and
ordered
his
relief
unless
he
should
retried.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
this
judgment
on
its
merits.
petitioner
however
had
contended
that
the
state
had
failed
to
appeal
within
the
time
prescribed
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
and
appellate
procedure
and
that
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
and
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
on
this
jurisdictional
issue.
we
do
not
reach
the
merits.
the
question
of
some
interest
of
lawyers
and
judges
that
prompted
us
to
review
this
case,
consents
the
applicability
of
certain
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
we
hold
that
these
rules
do
apply
and
the
state's
appeal
not
having
been
filed
within
the
30
days
of
the
original
order
by
the
district
court
was
not
timely
under
the
rules.
accordingly
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
lacked
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
courts
order.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
