mr.
flaxman,
i
suppose
that
is
the
argument
is
it
not,
as
to
what
is
the
final
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
has
to
be
your
position,
but
i
suppose
one
could
argue
that
january
26th
order
was
the
final
order?
unknown
speaker
of
course.
the
district
judge
did
stay
the
earlier
order
pending
for
the
hearing,
did
he
not,
pending
an
evidentiary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
time
did
they
enter
dwelling?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
night?
unknown
speaker
are
you
placing
any
emphasis
on
that
fact?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
opposition
will
take
to
the
position
that
there
were
exigence
circumstances
here.
are
you
relying
on
the
fact
it
was
what
you
call
night,
even
though
in
may
it
would
be
alright?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
i
asked
the
question.
unknown
speaker
no
it
is
a
little
different
than
3
a.m,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
concede
that
if
the
police
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
one
of
the
four
was
guilty
of
this
rape
that,
that
would
have
given
probable
cause
for
them
to
arrest
all
four
of
them?
unknown
speaker
then
what
do
you
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
they
were
two
teenagers
who
then
address
name
browder,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
they
were
in
fact
two
of
them?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
question
about
there
being
browders
when
you
say
they
said
they
were
browder?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
conceded
that
they
were
two
brothers
by
the
name
of
browder?
unknown
speaker
who
were
picked
up
among
the
four?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
let
me
ask
another
question.
suppose
that
your
client
(inaudible)
browder
was
the
only
one
there,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
would
you
answer
the
question,
would
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
conceding
that
the
four
were
arrested
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
weaken
your
case
by
abandoning
all
reliance
on
60
(b)?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
did
not.
on
the
other
hand
if
this
is
jurisdictional,
may
this
court
make
it
for
you?
unknown
speaker
did
you
read
the
cases
that
healy
cited
for
that
preposition?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
lead
case
that
the
healy
cited
says
that
the
filing
of
an
untimely
petition
for
re-hearing
does
not
extend
the
time
for
a
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
case
is
bowman
v.
loperena,
you
ever
read
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
healy
is
â€“
people
who
wrote
healy
have
certainly
read
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
do
you
think
we
must
reach
the
rule
35
issue
that
you
also
raised?
