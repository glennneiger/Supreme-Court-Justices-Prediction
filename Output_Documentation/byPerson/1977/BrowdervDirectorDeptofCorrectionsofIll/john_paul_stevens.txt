justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
mckoski
could
not
the
attorney
general
within
the
10
days
provided
by
rule
59
have
filed
a
motion
to
amend
the
order
to
give
in
time
to
conduct
a
factual
investigation
and
file
an
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
have
avoided
the
whole
problem
of
the
timeliness
of
the
appeal,
would
not
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
filed
the
motion
within
the
10
days.
see
the
problem
of
your
position
is
i
understand
it
is,
that
the
10-day
requirement
just
becomes
an
nullity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
that
is
true,
is
it
significant
that
the
order,
the
motion
was
filed
within
--
in
28
days
rather
than
say
31
or
32
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
mckoski,
even
if
you
treat
it
as
a
criminal
case,
it
would
not
solve
your
healy
and
dieter
problem,
because
there
there
was
no
rule
authorizing
appeal
by
the
government,
where
delay
in
the
time
to
appeal
by
the
government,
whereas
there
is
a
provision
for
some
kind
of
a
motion
by
a
defendant
that
loses
its
neck
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
after
conviction
move
into
district
court
for
a
new
trail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
the
government
cannot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
the
thing
that
the
thing
that
was
missing
in
the
â€“
it
is
not
just
a
civil,
criminal
distinction,
but
also
the
fact
that
he
was
a
party
who
had
no
right
in
the
district
court
to
get
an
extension
of
time
for
a
new
trial,
other
than
by
an
analogy
to
a
petition
for
a
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
even
if
you
treated
this
as
a
criminal
case,
you
still
have
your
10-day
problem
because
here
there
is
a
rule
squarely
in
point
that
says
within
10
days,
the
court
has
power
to
order
or
amend
the
judgment?
