and
further,
renquist's
question,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
you.
supposed
an
officer
makes
an
affidavit
that
--
that
he
has
been
told
by
a
reliable
informant,
et
cetera,
that
such
and
such
is
the
case
that
they're
representing
that
the
affiant
has
told
him
--
whether
the
informers
told
him
that
certain
facts
were
true.
now,
--
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
search
warrant
should
be
upset
and
suppression
should
follow
from
--
if
--
if
one,
the
--
the
officer
who
made
the
affidavit
never
had
any
such
conversations
at
all.
or
--
and
if
it's
admitted
that
he
had
the
conversation
with
the
informant,
and
the
informant
did
tell
him
that,
but
what
the
informant
told
him
was
false.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
are
you
even
addressing
the
letter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
don't
want
you
to
or
any
but
our
base
--
you
don't
think
that's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
you
submitting
that
--
that
you
should
be
able
to
attack
the
warrant
based
on
the
false
statements
of
the
informer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes
or
no.
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
know,
i
didn't
realize
you
were
suggesting
that
anytime
a
person
comes
and
makes
an
allegation
that
the
--
that
the
affidavits
contain
some
inaccurate
information
that
you
should
be
allowed
to
put
on
your
proof.
don't
--
don't
you
have
to
also
as
you
suggest,
indicate
that
the
officer
knew
it
was
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
every
case,
you
just
make
the
allegation
whether
you
have
any
basis
whatsoever
and
you
can
put
the
officer
on
the
stand
and
cross-examine
him.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
what
reason
then
--
what
reason?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
what
reason?
and
does
he
have
to
stay
and
say
what
the
reason
is
before
he
can
get
a
hearing
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
--
it
certainly
indicated
that
the
anticipative
putting
on
the
testimony
of
informers
who
would
deny
that
they
had
any
conversations
like
that
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
that
he
--
he
would
put
on
the
witnesses
who
would
claim
they
didn't
have
the
conversations
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
if
he
had
a
--
what
if
he
had
prepared
an
informal
offer
of
proof
to
which
was
attached
affidavits
of
the
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
would
that
be
different
in
terms
of
the
fourth
corners
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
you
--
would
you
say
that
it's
a
--
would
you
say
that
if
he
hadn't
made
a
formal
offer
of
proof
supported
by
affidavits
by
--
of
the
witnesses
who
say,
“we
never
had
any
conversation
with
the
officer,
whatsoever?”
now,
suppose
that
he
had
made
that
sort
of
a
submission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
that
--
then
let's
suppose
the
delaware
court
had
still
said
“it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
your
submission
is.
the
--
the
--
you
--
you
may
not
attack
the
face
of
the
warrant.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
constitutionally
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
the
issue
is
here.
is
it
constitutional
or
not
to
--
for
a
state
to
deny
a
--
a
chance
to
attack
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
would
still
say
that
delaware
constitutionally
could
say
“we're
going
to
--
we're
just
not
going
to
allow
any
kind
of
an
attack
on
the
--
on
the
warrant.”
even
if,
--
even
if
their
affidavits
that
the
affiant
officer
committed
perjury?
