justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us,
as
the
title
suggests,
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
first
state,
the
state
of
delaware.
the
case
presents
an
important
and
long
standing
issue
of
fourth
amendment
of
law.
that
issue
is
whether
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
ever
has
a
right
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
subsequent
to
the
ex-parte
issuance
of
search
warrant
to
challenge
the
truthfulness
of
factual
statements
made
in
an
affidavit
that
supported
that
warrant.
specifically,
prior
to
his
delaware
state
trial
on
rape
and
related
charges
and
in
connection
with
his
motion
to
suppress
certain
items
of
clothing
and
a
knife
found
in
the
search
of
his
apartment,
petitioner
challenged
the
truthfulness
of
certain
factual
statements
made
in
the
police
affidavit
supporting
the
warrant
to
search
the
apartment.
he
also
sought
to
call
witnesses
to
prove
the
misstatements.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
state's
objection
and
denied
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
followed
that
the
clothing
and
knife
were
admitted
as
evidence
at
the
ensuring
trial,
at
which
petitioner
was
convicted.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
affirmed.
it
held
that
a
defendant
under
no
circumstances
may
challenge
the
veracity
of
a
sworn
statement
used
by
police
to
procure
a
search
warrant.
because
of
the
statements,
federal
courts
have
not
been
uniform
in
their
resolution
of
this
issue,
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
where
the
defendant
makes
a
substantial
preliminary
showing
that
a
false
statement
knowingly
and
intentionally,
or
with
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth,
was
included
by
the
affiant
in
the
warrant
affidavit,
and
if
the
allegedly
false
statement
is
necessary
to
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
that
a
hearing
be
held
at
the
defendant's
request.
there
is
a
caveat
however,
in
order
to
mandate
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
challenger's
attack
must
be
more
than
conclusory
and
it
must
be
supported
by
more
than
a
mere
desire
to
cross-examine.
the
allegation
of
deliberate
falsehood
or
of
reckless
disregard
must
point
out
specifically
the
supporting
reasons,
the
portion
of
the
warrant
affidavit
that
is
claimed
to
be
false.
it
also
must
be
accompanied
by
an
offer
of
proof,
including
affidavits
or
sworn
or
otherwise
reliable
statements
of
witnesses,
or
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
their
absence.
if
these
requirements
as
to
allegations
that
and
offer
of
proof
are
met,
and
if,
when
material
that
is
the
subject
of
the
alleged
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
is
set
to
one
side,
there
remains
sufficient
content
in
the
warrant
affidavit
to
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause,
then
no
hearing
is
required,
but
if
the
remaining
content
is
insufficient,
then
the
defendant
is
entitled
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
towards
hearings.
if,
after
a
hearing,
a
defendant
establishes
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
false
statement
was
included
by
the
affiant
knowingly
and
intentionally,
or
with
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth,
and
the
false
statement
was
necessary
to
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
then
the
search
warrant
must
be
voided
and
the
fruits
of
the
search
excluded
from
the
trial
to
the
same
extent
as
if
probable
cause
was
lacking
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed
today.
i
am
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
dissent
by
the
chief
justice.
