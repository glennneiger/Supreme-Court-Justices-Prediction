mr.
harrison
f.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i'd
like
to
present
to
the
court
the
idea
that
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
be
extended
to
this
case.
i
would
like
to
discuss
mapp
versus
ohio
which
was
the
case
which
made
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
applicable
to
the
states.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
mapp
was
a
search
without
a
warrant.
the
articles
seized
were
contraband,
the
very
subject
of
the
charge,
and
i
think
this
is
important.
they
were
testimonial
in
nature
and
there
appeared
to
be
no
alternative
remedy
for
the
invasion
except
a
deterrent
supression
of
the
evidence.
in
stone
versus
powell,
this
court
had
occasion
to
analyze
mapp's
application
to
the
exclusionary
rule
to
be
founded
on,
one,
the
prevention
of
the
introduction
of
evidence
where
introduction
is
tantamount
to
a
coerced
confession,
two,
a
deterrence
of
fourth
amendment
violations,
and
three,
judicial
integrity.
this
case
is
markedly
distinguishable.
the
items
seized
were
not
testimonial
or
communicative.
let's
look
at
what
was
seized.
items
of
clothing.
now,
the
charges
were
burglary,
rape,
kidnapping.
these
items
of
clothing
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
so,
i
submit,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
overtones,
in
this
particular
case.
in
every
other
case
that
i
have
researched,
i
find
that
fifth
amendment
overtones,
or
sixth
amendment,
are
applicable.
therefore,
as
this
court
has
stated
in
calandra
and
--
i
believe,
in
janis,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
judicially
created
remedy
designed
to
case,
safeguard
fourth
amendment
rights,
generally,
through
its
deterrent
effect,
rather
than
a
personal
constitutional
right
of
the
party
aggrieved.
accepting
this,
then,
for
this
court
to
intervene
in
this
case,
i
submit
would
be
contrary
to
federalism
in
allowing
the
state
courts
without
a
constitutional
--
a
us
constitutional
point
to
come
before
this
court,
it
would
be
unjust
for
this
court
to
interfere.
as
justice
clark
stated
in
kerr
versus
california
and
mapp
versus
ohio,
we
followed
boyd
versus
us
which
held
the
fourth
amendment,
implemented
by
the
self
incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth,
forbids
the
federal
government
to
convict
a
man
of
a
crime
by
using
testimony
or
papers
obtained
from
him.
now,
let
me
point
out
here
that
the
respondent,
in
1950,
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule
of
weeks.
and
that
is
so
noted
in
elkins
versus
us
as
one
of
the
states
that
had
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule
by
means
of
case
law,
rickards
versus
state
,
77
a.
2d
199
(1950).
this
is
prior
to
mapp.
now,
our
supreme
court,
the
delaware
supreme
court,
in
passing
on
this
matter,
felt
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
i
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
should
be
confirmed.
the
next
point,
the
application
of
the
defendant
for
a
hearing.
the
court
has
discussed
it
rather
thoroughly.
they
know
what
it
amounts
to.
i
submit
it
was
merely
highly
speculative
and
not
a
grounds
for
conducting
a
hearing.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
when
you
say
informer
sir,
they
were
named
witnesses.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
that's
he
wanted
to
do,
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
that's
what
he
wanted
to
do,
but
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
that's
a
different
proposition,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
well,
rule
41(c)
of
the
delaware
criminal
rules
specifies
on
supression
of
evidence
that
the
motion
will
be
by
affidavit
--
supported
by
affidavit,
i
should
say,
and
specifies
all
this.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
if
he
had
shown
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
no.
the
delaware
court
would
have
been
wrong
in
that
case.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
constitutional
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
i
would
say
it's
not
constitutionally
wrong,
unless
the
court
considers
the
--
and
the
only
out
would
be
judicial
integrity,
it
would
appear
to
me
in
that
case.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
now,
when
we
come
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
that's
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
compare
the
mapp
rule
with
the
deterrent
that's
already
built
into
this
situation.
calandra
said,
i
believe,
that
only
the
most
efficacious
cases
would
the
--
would
the
exclusionary
rule
be
applied.
i
submit
that
this
is
not
one.
the
situation
here
is
you
have
a
deterrent
of
a
perjury
charge
or
a
criminal
charge.
the
deterrent
rule
exclusion
of
evidence
punishes
who?
it
punishes
society.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
perjury
rule
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
individual
involved.
he's
the
one
that's
a
shocker.
now
you
say,
“well,
if
we
exclude
the
trial
that
might
deter
him.”
i
submit
that
the
police
office
who
would
lie
under
oath
is
not
one
that's
going
to
be
deterred
by
that,
by
exclusion
of
the
evidence
at
trial.
he
has
demonstrated
that
he
is
really
not
interested
in
enforcing
the
law.
he
is
sort
of
interested
in
violating
it.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
well,
i
come
then
to
the
last
area
in
which
i
submit
that
the
--
the
evidence
submitted
are
tendered
in
evidence,
the
articles
of
clothing
submitted
were
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
items
that
were
introduced
consisted
of
clothing
which,
in
effect
were
identification.
we
had
in
addition
to
that,
two
statements
made
by
the
defendant
not
admitting
guilt
but
admitting
his
identification
had
an
opening
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
the
harmless
area,
yes
your
honor.
they
didn't
get
to
it.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
apparently.
it
was
made
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
that
i
can't
answer.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
thank
you
your
honors.
i
submit
then
under
those
circumstances
that
the
evidence
as
submitted
there
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
--
and
briefly,
the
defendant
made
two
statements
prior
to
trial
admitting
that
he
was
a
participant.
the
defense
counsel's
opening
statement
did
not
deny
participation
but
rather
raised
the
defense
of
consent.
the
victim
positively
identified
the
defendant
at
trail.she
has
had
an
opportunity
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
be
with
him,
15
minutes
of
which
were
in
daylight
conditions.
and
lastly,
when
the
defendant
took
the
stand
himself,
his
first
question,
he
was
asked
if
he
had
had
intercourse
with
the
victim
on
that
day,
his
answer
was
yes.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
the
knife.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
the
identification
of
the
knife,
your
honor,
was
objected
to
by
the
defense
counsel
as
not
being
a
positive
identification.
he
couldn't
have
said
truer
words,
it
was
not.
what
the
victim
said
was
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
not
clearly,
but
he
did
object
on
the
--
that
it
was
not
the
--
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
right.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
have.
but
what
i'm
telling
about
is
before
the
jury
of
--
now
this
motion
was
not
before
the
jury.
my
point
is
that
the
jury
was
impressed
by
defense
counsel's
motion.
it
was
brought
emphatically
to
their
attention
that
the
knife
had
never
been
identified
as
“the
knife.”
what
the
victim
said
was
that
it
was
that
knife
had
one
smooth
edge
and
one
sharp
edge
and
that
was
“like
the
knife.”
there
was
no
positive
identification
of
the
knife.
that
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
matter.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
rugendorf?
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
no
sir.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
well,
frankly,
i
didn't
think
i
needed
to,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
f.
turner
that's
what
i
--
that's
was
my
conclusion.
i
suppose
i
didn't
go
to
rugendorf
to
start
with
because
the
first
statement
was
the
hearing
had
been
granted.
they
assumed
that
was
correct.
i
think
that
probably
stirred
me
off.
i
apologize.
