chief
justice

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
5176,
franks
against
delaware.
mr.
huntley,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
nothing,
a
related
question
that
flows
from
that,
if
there's
enough
in
the
warrant
which
is
true
to
support
the
search?
that's
the
next
question,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
--
tell
me
this,
mr.
huntley.
is
there
something
more
than
the
statement
on
page
16
of
the
appendix
by
defense
counsel
as
to
his
offer
of
proof
as
to
what
he
would
prove
if
the
hearing
were
granted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
statement,
“your
honor,
i
intend
to
produce
a
certain
man
who
i
believe
will
give
information
that
will
tend
to
impeach
the
information”
and
then
it
goes
on
further
that
--
“but
throug
the
fact
that
it
was
never
given
and
as
such
there
may
have
been
a
rather
material
misrepresentation.”
now,
do
you
depend
on
more
that
to
have
alerted
the
court
to
which
you
are
going
to
prove?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
nothing
in
writing.
there
is
no
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
counsel.
you
may
resume,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
enough
accurate
information
is
found
in
the
affidavit,
you
consider
that
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
renders
inaccuracy
as
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
that
alter
the
basic
preposition
that
you
have
now
agreed
to
twice?
that
if
there
is
unchallenged
material
in
the
application
--
application
for
a
warrant,
which
would
sustain
probable
cause
and
everything
else
is
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
understand
that
we
had
a
case
argued
only
last
week
where
it
had
a
warrant
obtained
and
was
obtainable
there
--
there
being
time,
nevertheless,
it
would
have
been
great
pressure
to
--
to
recite
the
necessary
material.
and
it
--
it
could
be
almost
unlikely
that
there
would
be
a
perfect
affidavit
for
a
warrant
at
anytime.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
counsel
made
this
rather
speculative,
indeed
highly
speculative
proffer,
why
couldn't
he
have
presented
by
affidavits
exactly
what
he
proposed
to
present
to
the
court
ultimately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
it
turned
out,
he
had
to
do
both,
on
your
theory.
on
your
claim,
he
would
have
to
do
both.
he's
--
he's
considered
it
preliminarily
here.
and
--
and
now,
you
are
here
saying
that
you
want
him
to
conduct
the
full
adversary
hearing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
if
the
judge
had
said
in
response
to
this
proffer,
i
have
considered
the
points
which
you
say
you
may
possibly
be
able
to
prove.
and
even
if
you
proved
them
all,
there's
enough
remaining
here
to
support
probable
cause
and
your
motion
is
therefore
denied.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
turner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
i
--
i
think
you
are
undoubtedly
aware
those
arguments
had
they
been
advanced
to
the
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
briefs,
and
to
no
avail.
it
has
persuaded
some
members
of
the
court,
but
not
the
majority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
some
interesting
parallels,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-5176
franks
against
delaware
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
