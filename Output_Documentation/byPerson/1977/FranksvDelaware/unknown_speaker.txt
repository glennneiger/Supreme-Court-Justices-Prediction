unknown
speaker
well,
let
--
let
me
follow
up
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
those
are
clear
statements
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
affiant
was
--
was
making
a
misstatement
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
may
be
lying.
unknown
speaker
and
knowing
they're
lying.
unknown
speaker
mr.
huntley
--
unknown
speaker
neither
you
know
your
opposition
has
cited
rugendorf
against
united
states.
so,
although
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
does,
will
you
have
some
comments
on
that
after
lunch?
because
i
think
this
an
obstacle
for
you
in
this
case
that
these
inquiries
from
the
bench
have
brought
into
focus,
as
to
whether
the
misstatements
here
are
of
sufficient
integrity
to
escape
the
ruling
of
rugendorf.
unknown
speaker
one
way,
you're
drawing
the
distinction
between
double
hearsay
and
hearsay,
aren't
you,
among
other
things?
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
just
think
that
--
that
the
rugendorf
case
represents
a
significant
hurdle
for
you
to
get
over.
but
i
am
surprised
that
neither
of
you
cited
it,
and
it
was
up
to
the
sg
in
his
amicus
brief
to
--
to
bring
it
up.
but
then,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
that's
because
it
says
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
my
--
so
the
question
remains
that
--
does
all
he
have
to
do
is
make
the
allegation
and
then
--
and
then
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
he's
got
any,
why
doesn't
he
present
it?
you
--
you
mean,
he
wants
to
--
he
wants
to
just
cross-examine
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
also,
if
you're
going
to
do
this,
i
suppose
you
have
another
leg
up
on
getting
the
names
of
informants.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
magistrate
is
entitled
to
do
that
when
he
issues
the
warrant.
for
all
you
know,
he
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
the
--
nevertheless,
the
magistrate
is
--
can
cross-examine
and
get
oral
testimony
if
he
wants.
and
if
he
has
any
doubts
about
it,
he
doesn't
issue
the
warrant,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
this
argument
made
to
the
delaware
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
need
to
get
to
it.
unknown
speaker
ordinarily
we
don't
get
to
it
either
unless
the
lower
court
had
to.
unknown
speaker
we
were
entitled
there
just
to
support
the
judgment
on
any
ground
that
was
urged
this
court
below,
but
there
are
many
times
we
don't
take
the
invitation.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
turner,
what
about
the
knife?
unknown
speaker
the
knife,
that's
the
usual.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
he
also
object
to
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
had
been
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
hadn't
the
knife
also
been
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
and
didn't
he
also
object
on
that
ground
as
well
as
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
made
a
motion
to
suppress
and
that
covered
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
would
have
included
the
knife
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
general
turner
a
question?
do
i
understand
you
are
not
relying
on
the
rugendorf
case
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
why?
