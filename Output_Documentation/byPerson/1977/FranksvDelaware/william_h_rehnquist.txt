justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
huntley,
i've
read
the
colloquy
between
judge
bush
and
trial
counsel
in
the
delaware
trial
court
and
i
gather
what
his
--
what
the
trial
counsel
sought
to
contest
was
the
affiance
representation
as
to
what
had
been
told
him
by
two
other
people,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
--
and
in
what
respect
does
that
incorrect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
wanted
to
show
that
they
had
not
had
any
conversations
with
the
affiant
and
the
affiant
had
said
they
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
an
issue
that
could
be
litigated
in
this
supression
here
when
i
take
it
under
the
rule
you're
contending
for.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
affiant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
this
apply
to
an
arrest
warrant
as
well
as
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguished
this
case
from
calandra,
then
where
we
said
that
the
fact
that
suppressible
testimony
had
been
given
before
the
grand
jury
didn't
void
the
ultimate
indictment
rendered
by
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
in
effect,
said
that
you
can't
impeach
the
warrant
for
any
reason,
whatever.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
maligning
my
colleague,
mr.
justice
black.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you're
--
you're
talking
about
kind
of
a
--
of
a
spectrum
in
a
--
a
balance
one
way
or
the
other,
aren't
you?
here,
where
you
--
well,
one
could
have
a
rule
that
the
magistrate
--
once
the
magistrate
has
issued
a
warrant,
the
warrant
requirement
is
satisfied
even
though
a
court
related
to
determine
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
warrant
didn't
satisfy
probable
cause.
now,
the
aguilar
and
spinelli
hold
otherwise.
now,
you
--
or
you
could
have
a
rule
that
the
court
can
determine
probable
cause
but
the
magistrates
find
and
insist
to
credibility.
a
factual
credibility
will
be
upheld.
you
--
you
want
a
third
rule
that
says,
â€œthe
magistrates
determination
in
either
case
would
be
upheld
and
re-subject
to
reexamination
by
a
court.
there
there's
a
--
you're
--
you're
talking
about
basically
on
incremental
deterrent
value.
you're
--
not
something
that's
an
absolute
right
under
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
--
and
yet,
you
yourself
say
that,
where
the
information
is
false
but
the
officer
didn't
have
any
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
false,
it's
--
it
complies
with
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
your
--
does
your
allegation
that
gives
rise
to
your
right
to
discovery
or
hearing
have
to
be
any
more
than
just
an
allegation
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
of
our
cases
says
that
the
purpose
of
the
warrant,
where
i
think
it's
the
mcdonald
case,
or
is
to
interpose
between
the
police
authorities
and
the
defendant,
the
neutral
magistrate.
it
doesn't
say
the
whole
court
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
not
be
because
the
--
as
the
court
said
in
shadwick
versus
city
of
tampa,
a
magistrate
need
not
be
one
trained
in
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
delaware
said.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
--
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
take
that
position?
