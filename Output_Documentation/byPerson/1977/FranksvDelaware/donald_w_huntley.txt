mr.
donald
w.
huntley
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
that's
presented
in
the
franks
case
is
one
that's
troubled
the
court
for
a
good
length
of
time,
and
that
is
very
simply,
what
is
to
be
done
if
a
search
is
conducted
pursuant
to
the
warrant,
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
and
the
affidavit
supporting
that
search
warrant
just
isn't
true?
we
would
all
like
to
thank
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
that's
true.
it
would
seem
that
a
warrant
should
be
able
to
stand
on
those
facts
that
are
in
at
even
the
event
--
even
in
the
event
that
there
are
misstatements
within
the
warrant.
and
we
would
all
like
to
believe
that
the
police
in
the
united
states
simply
don't
use
false
affidavits
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
in
the
present
case,
however,
the
petitioner
wanted
the
opportunity
to
show
at
trial
that
certain
misstatements
were
made
in
the
application
for
a
search
warrant
and
the
affidavits
supporting
that
application.
we
submit
that
the
remedy
when
the
issue
comes
up,
it
is
to
first
allow
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
make
such
a
showing.
and
if
he
does
show
that
in
fact
the
misstatements
were
made
in
the
search
warrant
application,
then
the
resulting
evidence
ought
to
be
excluded.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
not
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
the
contested
allegations
in
the
search
warrant
affidavit
were
very
simply
whether
certain
conversations
took
place
at
all.
now,
in
the
absence
of
those
conversations
taking
the
--
taking
place,
the
defendant
was
prepared
to
show
further
that
the
representations
that
were
behind
what
allegations
were
made
were
erroneous.
but
the
basic
issue
was
the
existence
or
none
existence
of
certain
arguments,
of
certain
conversations
between
the
affiant
officer
and
two
witnesses.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
exactly.
the
respondent
has
argued
that
if
misstatements
are
shown
and
that
this
are
material,
that
the
remedy
of
exclusion
is
very
simply
too
harsh.
they
said
that
delaware
has
suggested
the
benefit
of
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
turned
effect
is
far
outweighed
by
the
societal
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
orderly
criminal
law
enforcement.
we
disagree
that
the
remedy
of
exclusion
is
too
harsh.certainly,
in
the
case
of
a
substantial
misstatement
on
the
part
of
an
affiant,
civil
prosecution
for
damages,
if
they
could
be
assessed,
certainly
wouldn't
be
a
remedy
that
be
would
be
too
harsh
for
the
affiant
involved.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
the
consideration
--
this
situation
that
we
have
in
the
present
case
is
the
first.
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
i
--
i
think
we
can
very
well.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
to
a
certain
extent,
it
is
involved
in
this
case
because
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
witnesses
that
the
defendant
sought
to
present.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
there
are
two
considerations
that
are
involved.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
in
some
circumstances,
yes.
the
considerations
that
should
go
into
the
determination
of
the
exclusion
of
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
are
dictated
by
two
factors.
first,
the
fundamental
reason
for
exclusion
itself
is
one
of
deterrence.
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
in
the
stone
v.
powell
case,
when
law
enforcement
officers
have
acted
mistakenly,
but
in
good
faith,
unreasonable
grounds,
and
yet
the
evidence
they
have
seized
is
later
excluded,
the
exclusion
can
have
no
deterrent
effect.
we
should,
in
all
circumstances,
keep
in
mind
what
the
effect
is
likely
to
be
in
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
now,
turning
to
the
particular
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
was
addressing,
the
primary
consideration
should
be
whether
there
will
be
a
substantial
deterrent
effect
in
the
exclusion
of
every
--
any
particular
piece
of
evidence.
now,
to
carry
this
step
further,
we
need
to
concentrate
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
assumption
of
the
affiant.
if
in
fact
the
evidence
that
he
relies
on
was
false
but
he
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
it
to
be
true,
certainly,
we
aren't
going
to
have
any
significant
benefit
from
the
exclusion
of
that
particular
evidence.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
true.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
right.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that
particular
situation
is
in
front
of
us
but
i
should
think
that
yes,
the
same
considerations
would
apply.
the
constitution
in
the
cases
of
searches
and
seizures
requires
that
the
search
be
reasonable
or
prohibits
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
the
considerations
involved
there
were
that
--
the
differences
in
procedures
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
actual
trial
were
so
great
as
to
warrant
a
distinction
and
permit
the
use
of
the
evidence
by
the
grand
jury
even
though
it
wouldn't
be
admissible
at
trial,
if
i
understand
the
cases
correctly.
we
would
suggest
that
the
culpability
of
the
misstatements
is
a
very
important
consideration
that
is
central
to
the
issues
that
we
have
here.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
--
no.
the
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
no,
this
is
as
far
as
the
trial
counsel
was
allowed
to
proceed
in
the
presentation
of
evidence.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
true.
but
what
i
meant
by
the
fact
that
they
went
no
further
was
that
they
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
there
were
no
affidavits
presented
by
the
proposed
witnesses.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
exactly.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
right.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
true.
they
said
that
there
was
no
basis
after
the
initial
magistrate's
ruling
on
the
validity
of
the
warrant
to
show
that
the
warrant
was
false.
and
this
is
the
decision
that
we
appeal
here.
we
think
that
in
consideration
of
this
question,
the
categories
of
culpability
should
be
given
very
careful
consideration
by
the
court.
while
here,
we
sought
to
show
that
there
were
specific
misstatements,
that
is,
plain
inaccuracies
that
should
have
been
known
by
the
police
officer.
we
don't
have
the
actual
benefit
of
the
testimony
here.
and
the
actual
testimony,
of
course,
should
have
--
could
have
shown
anything
from
a
complete
fabrication
to
a
simple
misunderstanding
or
innocent
error
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
the
categories
of
misstatements
have
been
broken
down
into
four
sections
ranging
from
completely
innocent
misstatements
through
negligent
misstatements,
reckless
misstatements
or
in
the
worst
case,
willful
misstatements.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i'll
consider
that.
the
categories
that
we
suggest
deserve
consideration
for
a
possible
exclusion
of
evidence
are
the
three
categories
that
i
feel
warrant
that
particular
remedy.
that
is,
those
misrepresentations
that
have
a
degree
of
malfeasance
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
those
categories
that
we
set
forth
before
that
contains
some
malfeasance
are
those
that
involve
either
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
--
the
chief
justice
and
the
court.
before
the
lunch
and
recess,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
inquired
about
the
relation
between
the
present
case
and
the
situation
that
was
treated
by
the
court
in
the
rugendorf
case.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
distinctions
between
the
present
situation
and
the
--
the
rugendorf
case,
i
think,
are
quite
clear
and
quite
significant.
in
the
rugendorf,
there
were
two
allegations
for
the
inaccuracy
or
the
inappropriateness
of
the
search
warrant
affidavit.
the
first
was
that
the
affiant
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
make
his
allegations
because
he
was
merely
reporting
the
testimony
of
another,
and
that
since
this
informant's
testimony
by
way
of
the
officer
wouldn't
be
presentable
at
trial
that
it
shouldn't
provide
probable
cause
in
that
situation.
our
current
case
is
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
we're
concerned
about
the
occurrence
or
non-occurrence
of
the
conversation
itself,
and
that
the
admissibility
of
the
officers
reporting
of
that
conversation
at
trial.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
imagine
so,
yes.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
well,
we
believe
that
that
is
a
primary
consideration
in
the
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
then,
too,
in
the
rugendorf
case,
the
factual
inaccuracies
were
first
of
a
minor
nature,
and
secondly,
were
the
inaccuracies
made
by
the
informant
and
not
the
affiant.
and
we
believe
this
is
a
very
important
consideration
here.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
believe
that
justice
would
dictate
that
result,
yes.
in
the
present
situation,
however,
the
allegations
that
we're
dealing
with
went
to
the
very
heart
of
the
content
of
the
search
warrant
affidavit.
the
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
we
would
concede
that.
i
argue
in
this
case,
though,
that
that
wasn't
the
situation
that
the
only
allegations
in
the
search
warrant
affidavit
are
related
specifically
to
the
evidence.
so,
that
was
found
in
the
likelihood
of
the
evidence
being
in
the
defendant's
apartment.
i've
pointed
out
to
the
court
what
we
feel
are
the
basic
considerations
in
excluding
evidence
obtained
to
--
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
where
the
affidavit
was
false.
and
that
is
that
the
evidence
should
be
excluded
only
when
first,
there
are
some
reasonable
chances
that
such
exclusion
could
deter
the
misstatements
in
the
future.
and
secondly,
that
the
misstatements
were
unreasonable
within
the
specific
wording
of
the
constitution.
if
for
example,
the
basis
for
the
affiant's
statements
was
inaccurate,
but
at
the
same
time
he
reasonably
believed
them
to
be
accurate
and
there
were
no
courses
of
inquiry
that
he
should
have
pursued,
as
a
reasonable
man
should
have
pursued,
then
clearly,
his
conduct
was
reasonable
and
at
the
same
time
no
deterrent
effect
can
be
made
by
excluding
evidence
based
on
reasonable
conduct.
we'd
also
like
to
explore
the
specific
circumstances
under
which
the
defendant
should
be
allowed
to
make
a
showing
of
inaccurate
statements
in
the
search
warrant.
both
the
amicus
united
states
as
well
as
the
respondent
has
suggested
that
a
preliminary
showing
of
some
kind
be
required
possibly
to
the
extent
of
requiring
affidavit
evidence
before
this
is
submitted
for
a
suppression
hearing
and
the
defendant
given
the
opportunity
to
show
these
inaccuracies.
the
most
frequently
advanced
argument
for
this
is
that
it
would
prevent
time-consuming
and
frivolous
exercises
at
court
in
search
of
misstatements
when
there's
no
reasonable
belief
that
misstatements
actually
exist.
we
suggest
that
this
is
not
a
reasonable
apprehension.
i
personally
don't
have
extensive
experience
in
criminal
practice,
but
i
rely
on
the
judgment
of
those
of
our
colleagues
that
have
made
a
detailed
study
of
this.
for
example,
professor
grano,
in
his
treatment
of
this
subject,
points
out
that
60%
to
90%
of
all
defendants
plead
guilty,
usually
without
a
prior
motion
to
suppress.
second,
most
searches
are
conducted
without
warrants,
and
the
defendants
in
this
cases
now
have
full
opportunity
to
file
a
suppression
motion.
third,
even
in
those
few
cases
involving
warrants,
defendants
can
obtain
a
suppression
hearing
of
limited
scope,
simply
by
asserting
that
the
warrant's
execution
was
unlawful.
hence,
permitting
defendants
to
controvert
warrants
would
increase
the
present
number
of
supression
hearings
only
insignificantly
and
merely
add
the
length
of
some
hearings
already
granted.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
right.but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
deterrent
value
is
much
more
applicable
to
the
present
situation
than
a
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
search
warrant.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
is
not
a
reasonable
search.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
exactly.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
i'd
so
submit.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
the
probable
cause
lies
with
the
affiant.
and
from
our
standpoint,
if
the
affiant
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
his
alligations,
this
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirement.
we
can't,
in
all
circumstances,
require
that
the
affiant
be
absolutely
correct,
as
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger
has
pointed
out
that
it's
unreasonable
to
require
that
degree
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
average
constable.
you
can't
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that
is
possible.
we'd
suggest
that
if
a
defendant
were
denied
the
opportunity
to,
as
a
mater
of
right,
to
challenge
the
authenticity
and
the
accuracy
of
the
search
warrant
allegations,
there
would
be
two
very
undesirable
consequences
that
would
flow
from
this.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes.
certainly,
the
proof
that's
required
is
that
the
officer's
conduct
was
unreasonable.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
we
submit
that
if
it
were
anything
different
than
just
an
allegation,
that
we'd
come
up
against
the
situation
that
was
held
satisfactory
in
the
carmichael
case.
there
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
i
believe
that
the
defendant
should
be
allowed
that
right.
if
he
has
a
--
a
reason
to
suspect
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
most
criminal
situations,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
discovery.
and
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
defendant
will
be
as
fortunate
as
he
was
in
this
case
and
have
a
specific
basis.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
think
for
satisfactory
fulfillment
of
the
constitutional
requirements,
the
defendant,
is
by
right,
entitled
to
the
opportunity
to
present
such
evidence
as
he
may
have.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
in
view
of
the
ex
parte
nature
of
the
initial
proceeding
in
granting
the
search
warrant,
i
think
that
he's
entitled
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
this
is
a
separate
issue
fortunately.
they're
not
involved
in
this
present
situation.
short
of
getting
the
identify
of
informants,
the
defendant
could,
at
the
very
least,
inquire
under
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
affiant's
alleged
information.
and
that
--
make
other
inquiries
that
would
test
the
credibility
of
his
--
like
having
an
actual
informant
or
whether
the
informant
gave
the
information
that
--
that
was
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
very
possible,
but
this
was
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
well,
it's
gratifying
to
have
some
authority
vested
in
the
magistrate
but
the
judicial
tradition
in
this
country
is
that
the
issues
are
best
discussed
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
well,
this
court
has
considered
the
role
of
the
magistrate
in
similar
situations
regarding
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations.
and
it
has
felt
that
the
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
in
the
search
warrant
affidavit
is
appropriate
at
a
suppression
hearing.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
a
possibility.
hopefully,
they
have
the
highest
degree
of
competence
possible.
but
it
seems
much
more
basic
to
have
a
review
of
a
factual
matter
through
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
of
course,
that's
unreasonable.
this
would
just
invite
the
destruction
of
evidence.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
in
the
present
case,
this
would
have
been
possible
if
he'd
recognized
the
necessity
for
a
preliminary
--
preliminary
showing.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
he
did
have
the
evidence
available
and
felt
possibly
that
it
would
be
an
undoing
position
on
the
time
of
the
presiding
judge
to
first
review
the
sufficiency
of
his
preliminary
showing.
and
then
subsequently,
hear
the
witnesses
besides.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
that's
right.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
with
that,
i
would
feel
it
would
be
a
final
adjudication
of
the
matter.
the
judge
certainly
would
have
resolved
the
doubts
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
and
the
there
would
have
clearly
been,
as
they're
all
reviewed,
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant.
we
think
that
if
the
preliminary
showing
would
require
--
would
be
required
that
we
would
have
a
--
a
two-fold
problem.
first,
the
allegations
would
--
for
the
invalidity
of
the
search
warrant
would
become
as
cursory
as
they
were
in
carmichael.
and
secondly,
i
think
that
we
would
see
a
--
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers
to
disguise
their
informants
and
even
when
they
do
have
a
--
a
probable
cause
for
an
affidavit
quoted
in
such
terms
so
that
the
credibility
of
this
information
couldn't
be
checked
by
the
defendant.
we
have
a
system
of
justice
that
has
systematically
eliminated
many
of
the
legal
fictions
that
we
had
in
the
english
common
law
and
the
statutory
law.
we
submit
that
the
requirement
of
a
special
preliminary
showing
and
inconsistent
with
the
--
the
routine
handling
of
search
warrant
affidavits
would
foster
the
presentation
of
new
legal
fictions
and
we
don't
believe
that
this
would
be
helpful
in
the
administration
of
justice.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
be
reversed
and
that
this
court
confirm
two
basic
corollaries
to
the
fourth
amendment.
first,
that
a
defendant
has
the
unfettered
right
to
show
at
a
suppression
hearing
that
an
affidavit
was
false.
and
secondly,
that
the
evidence
resulting
from
a
search
be
excluded
whenever
the
search
was
based
on
a
false
affidavit
that
a
reasonable
man
would
not
have
believed
to
be
true.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
thank
the
court.
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i'd
just
like
to
--
mr.
donald
w.
huntley
i
would
merely
like
to
take
issue
with
colonel
turner's
characterization
of
the
present
question
as
an
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
we
submit
that
the
exclusion
of
evidence
that
was
not
only
based
on
a
false
affidavit,
but
an
unreasonably
false
affidavit,
is
more
basic
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence
that
resulted
from
an
insufficient
affidavit
in
some
respect.
and
we
further
submit
that
the
constitutional
purpose
would
be
best
served
by
the
exclusion
of
all
evidence
that
was
so
introduced.
