mr.

you

another
way
if
i
may,
is
there
anything
more
to
do
before
they
sell
it
just
as
they
do
with
the
piece
of
beef
that
justice
stevens
is
talking
about,
except
perhaps
cut
in
half,
if
they
only
want
half
a
chicken?

mr.

can't
get
the
paper.
chief

we
were
phoned
last
week
by
someone
who
was
at
the
general's
office;
the
defender
can't
furnish
the
same
grade
paper
anymore.

mr.
shenefield,
when
you
spoke
a
while
ago
of
backward
and
forward,
is
it
correct
to
take
that
to
me
and
that
if
mr.
armour
and
mr.
swift
brought
the
ranches
and
the
herds,
or
if
some
ranchers
bought
large
ranches
owning
large
herds,
bought
swift
and
armour
company,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about
the
backward
and
forward
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
surely,
i
shouldn't
say
anything
sure
in
this
area.
it
would
be
more
likely,
i
take
it
that
the
forward,
that
is
if
the
farmers
did
their
own
processing,
then
if
the
processors
owning
no
farms,
trying
to
reverse
the
process.

but
shrimpers
and
oystermen
were
not
covered
by
this
or
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
certainly
the
industry,
business
analogy
is
there,
is
it
not?
the
producer
suffers
from
the
same
middleman
problem
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
posner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
all
from
farm
states
mr.
posner.
thank
you
gentlemen!
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
two
opinions
to
announce
this
morning.
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
