how
long
was
the
antitrust
division
thought
that
the
farmer
excluded
the
integrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
will
put
the
other
way;
did
it
ever
consider
the
integrator
to
be
a
farmer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
department
then
looked
back
and
put
the
legislative
history
in
context
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
agree,
i
take
it
that
the
integrator
integrates
a
little
farther
and
thus
the
growing,
that
he
is
a
farmer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
those
larger
more
integrated
units
could
price
fix
and
as
a
cooperative.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
property
of
the
farmers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
to
see,
if
the
integrator
just
owned
the
land,
but
nevertheless
got
independent
contractor
to
come
no
his
land
to
do
the
growing
function.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
contrary
wise,
contrary
wise
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
integrator
was
a
farmer
if
he
actually,
he
actually
did
the
growing.
justice
byron

doing
the
work
of
actually
feeding

chickens?
