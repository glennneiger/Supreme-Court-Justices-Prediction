mr.
john
h.
shenefield
mr.
chief
justice,
ma0y
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
about
statutory
interpretation,
about
the
statutory
interpretation
of
a
word
in
a
statute.
the
central
legal
question
in
the
case
is
whether
integrators
or
contract
producers,
that
do
everything
in
this
production
of
chicken
except
do
the
actual
growing,
who
have
divorced
themselves
from
the
actually
farming
of
chickens,
whether
those
integrators
are
nevertheless
farmers
within
the
meaning
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
now
the
importance
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
lies
in
this
single
fact.
reading
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
the
congress,
the
67th
congress
in
1922,
you
come
inevitably,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
conclusion
that
that
congress
intended
to
safeguard
actual
farmers,
farmers
on
the
land
and
doing
the
tilling
or
shepherding
of
the
crops
and
the
flocks.
they
did
that.
they
had
that
intention
in
order
to
safeguard
the
farmers
against
the
middlemen,
against
the
processors,
against
the
marketers.
and
so
the
case
really
raises
a
familiar
question,
namely;
are
we
to
honor
that
original
exemption;
that
original
intention
in
a
limited
way
focused
on
the
fact
situation
that
was
presented
by
that
congress
or
whether
we
are
now
to
interpret
it
in
a
somewhat
more
relaxed
fashion?
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well
the
risk
is,
it
turns
out
not
to
be
crucial
i
believe
in
the
legislative
history.
you
have
to
put
into
the
context
of
the
times,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
legislative
history.
after
world
war
i,
this
country
went
through
an
extraordinary
agriculture
depression.
senators
describe
the
state
of
agriculture
as
shambles,
as
in
the
worst
depression
that
it
had
ever
seen.
and
so
when
congress
sought
to
fashion
these
words
and
to
focus
it's
exemption,
it
did
so,
not
so
much
because
there
was
a
risk
of
one
kind
or
another,
but
because
they
saw
farmers
leaving
the
farms
and
going
to
the
city.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
when
you
look
at
the
reasons
that
farmers
at
the
land
in
the
farm
houses
suffer,
the
risks
they
bear,
the
costs
they
invest
and
all
of
those
factual
things
are
the
things
one
looks
at,
but
it
seems
to
me
no
single
one
of
them
nor
indeed
any
of
them
in
an
aggregate
should
be
deemed
to
be
determinative.
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
look
back
at
the
words
of
the
statute
themselves
and
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that
raises
the
question
mr.
justice
white
of
the
business
review
procedure.
in
1971
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
did.
in
1969
it
issued
a
business
review
which
focused
on
the
risk
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
integrators
were
farmers
within
the
capper-volstead
act.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
think
it
refined
its
views
and
in
1971
it
issued
a
second
business
review
letter
making
quite
clear
that
these
integrators
were
not
to
be
considered
farmers
and
indeed
a
press
release
was
issued
at
same
time.
all
business
reviews
as
a
matter
of
fact
stayed
either
in
the
relevant
code
of
federal
regulations
of
within
their
own
four
corners
that
they
are
to
be
taken
as
a
snapshot
of
intention
at
that
particular
time
and
may
indeed
be
revised
or
rescinded
and
this
is
just
such
a
situation.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
argue
that
anyone
was
misled
in
this
situation.
let
me
say
two
things,
three
things
about
what
the
case
is
not
about.
it
is
not
about
the
legality
of
the
petitioner's
conduct.
the
posture
that
the
case
finds
itself
here,
the
court
is
simply
required
to
construe
a
particular
statute.
second,
it
is
not
about
the
wisdom
of
the
provisions
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
really
the
task
i
guess
of
the
court
here
today
is
to
try
to
determine
what
that
67th
congress
would
have
done,
had
it
adverted
to
the
issue
before
the
court
and
third,
it
is
not
about
the
most
economically
efficient
way
to
run
the
poultry
business.
we
don't
challenge
vertical
integration
backward
or
forward.
we
challenge
only
the
notion
that
integrators
who
have
withdrawn
or
who
have
divorced
themselves
from
the
actual
farming
of
chickens
have
a
right
to
fix
prices
behind
an
exemption
intended
only.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct,
but
i
think
the
crucial
point
is
not
that
we
are
objecting
to
vertical
integration
as
a
general
concept
with
particular
emphasis
on
your
question
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct!
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
precisely
correct;
we
did
not
challenge
the
vertical
integration.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
would
depend
on
the
resolution
of
the
question
whether
meat
in
that
form
packed
by
meat
packers
were
an
agriculture
product.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
the
debate,
the
capital-volstead
debates
themselves
particularly
the
words
of
senator
cummins
make
quite
clear
that
he
thought
meat
packed
in
that
way
wasn't
agricultural
product,
and
if
that
were
the
conclusion,
then
they
would
be
farmers
in
the
situation
hypothesis
you
propose.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that
subject
came
up
in
the
legislative
history
as
i
recall
it,
and
there
are
references
to
mr.
armour
and
mr.
swift
who
if
they
bought
ranch
lands,
raised
the
cattle
themselves
and
endured
those
particular
kinds
of
risks,
they
too
could
be
farmers,
and
that
was
regarded
as
a
problem,
but
it
was
regarded
as
a
necessary
defect
of
trying
the
form
some
kind
of
standard
in
words
that
they
had
available
to.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
he
has
to
own,
technically
only
enough
to
have
the
buildings
sit
on
them.
the
average,
as
i
recall
the
average
contract
farmer
and
in
effect
has
about
five
acres
of
land
to
his
disposal.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
first
of
all
six
members
of
nbma
do
not
own
either
hatcheries
or
breeder
flocks.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
we
i
think
we
win
on
case-swayne
in
any
event,
but
i
don't
think
it
gets
us
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
no,
reason
is
that
we
would
be,
i
assume,
back
here
again
next
year,
because
the
association
will
have
reorganized
to
exclude
these
six
and
the
litigation
isn't
disposed
off,
but
i
think
just
to
go
to
that
point;
i
think
we
do
went
on
the
basis
of
case-swayne.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
land
ownership
on
the
one
hand
and
tilling
the
soil
on
the
other
hand
are
both
separate
and
independent.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
correct.
the
legislative
history
as
i
mention,
speaks
of
plantation
owners
and
tenant
farmers,
both
are
farmer
within
the
meaning
of
the
capper-volstead
act,
but
the
crucial
standard
is
either
ownership
of
the
land
itself,
or
the
tilling
of
the
soil
and
i
call
attention
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
tiller
of
the
soil,
grower
of
the
chicken,
shepherd
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
yes
sir.
in
footnote
27
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states
on
page
13
we
try
to
set
out
a
list
of
representative
selections
from
the
debates
that
gives
that
sort
of
an
impressionistic
feeling
of
precisely
what
it
was
that
that
congress
was
moving
toward,
and
what
it
was
trying
to
do
albeit
imperfectly?
any
one
of
us
could
have
picked
other
formulations
of
language
that
might
have
been
more
precise
or
done
it
better.
but
what
it
was
trying
to
do
was
to
safeguard
the
farmer
and
to
preserve
the
values
that
that
congress
associated
with
being
close
to
the
soil.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
we
have
a
slight
indication
of
what
that
congress
might
have
done
in
a
situation
because
they
were
offered
a
chance
to
view
something
called
the
phipps
amendment
which
is
referred
to
on
our
brief
at
page
15.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
have
the
phobia's
notion
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
technological
improvements.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
think
i
have,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
we
have
set
the
case
in
a
way
so
that
the
sole
question
i
take
it
is
the
applicability
of
the
words
as
farmers.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
true.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
no.
we
concede
that
if
they
organize
themselves
into
cooperative
associations,
associations
of
producers,
as
farmers,
dealing
with
the
products
that
they
farm,
that
they
themselves
raise,
that
they
are
then
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
no.
we
concede
only
the
exemption
to
the
extent
that
the
activities
they
do
are
mentioned
in
the
exempt
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
the
complaint
alleges
price
fixing.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
and
â€“
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
i
have
--
the
only
thing
one
can
say
is
to
that
i
suppose
is
that
if
they
are
price
fixing
and
the
exemption
doesn't
apply,
we
would
argue
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply,
if
they
are
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
think
at
least
the
burden
of
my
argument
is
precisely
that.
if
they
are
--
we
charge
price
fixing,
if
the
exemption
doesn't
apply,
they
are
liable
under
the
antitrust
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
am
not
aware
of
whether
the
record
or
the
appendix
shows
anything
on
that.
we're
focusing
at
this
point
on
the
question
of
whether
they
are
farmers.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
i
am
very
interested
in
it
if
it's
good,
i
just
don't
have
it
at
this
point.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
well,
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
sufficient
facts
at
least
in
my
view
to
dispose
of
the
issue
of
whether
these
defendants
are
farmers
within
the
capper-volstead
exemption.
other
questions
that
the
defendants
raised
in
their
answer,
such
as
the
applicability
of
the
cooperative
marketing
act
of
1926
and
all
of
those
questions
never
were
reached
by
the
district
court.
and
so
as
i
see
the
case
coming
up,
it
comes
in
a
rather
clear
and
narrow
fashion,
the
applicability
of
the
word
farmers
to
these
--
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that
was
what
i
was
talking
about
and
all
i
meant
to
say
is
that
that
issue
isn't
in
this
case
and
waits
until
another
day
whether
the
same
legal
rules
apply
to
backward
as
well
as
to
forward
integration.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
correct,
taking
into
account
the
concern
that
the
congress
had
for
the
farmers
and
their
wellbeing
as
opposed
to
mr.
armour
and
mr.
swift.
i
was
addressing
just
briefly
the
one
opportunity
that
congress
had
to
confront
a
similar
kind
of
problem
to
the
situation
we
have
here
today,
the
phipps
amendment,
which
is
mentioned
as
i
said
on
page
15
of
the
brief.
senator
phipps
in
effect
proposed
an
amendment
to
exempt
activities
of
manufacturers
or
producers
of
agricultural
products
provided
two
things,
provided
they
entered
into
pre-planting
contracts
and
provided
the
farmer's
compensation
depended
on
the
price
of
the
agricultural
commodity
in
the
ultimate
market.
now
when
he
talked
of
that
amendment
he
spoke
of
several
kinds
of
products
that
he
thought
--
several
kinds
of
processors
that
he
thought
might
be
covered
by
it,
milk
was
one,
fruits,
and
vegetables.
the
supporters
of
the
capper-volstead
act
were
steadfastly
opposed
to
the
phipps
amendment
and
it
was
defeated,
but
they
were
opposed,
because
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
went
far
beyond
that
narrow
focus,
that
narrow
concern
that
they
had
and
it's
instructive,
that
whole
incident
is
instructive
to
us
for
several
reasons.
one,
it
was
quite
clear
as
the
result
of
the
debates
that
pre-planting
contracts,
the
kind
of
arrangement
for
the
sale
of
the
crop
in
advance
of
planting
was
not
sufficient
to
make
those
processors,
farmers
under
the
capper-volstead
act
as
that
congress
sought
even
though
that
meant
that
the
processors
bore
much
of
the
risk
of
market
fluctuation
up
and
down.
it
also
showed
that
the
congress
thought
an
exemption
or
an
amendment
to
the
bill
then
on
the
floor
was
required
to
exempt
those
persons,
that
the
capper-volstead
act
did
not
do
it,
and
it
was
rejected
precisely
because
it
addressed
the
question
of
middleman
and
processors
and
sought
to
aid
them
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
congress
saw
as
the
difficulty
of
the
farmer.
and
so
the
defeat
of
the
amendment
is
important,
indeed
it's
regarded
significant
by
this
court
in
the
case-swayne
opinion
and
the
reasons
for
the
defeat
are
crucial
because
in
effect
it
shows
that
congress
wanted
to
narrowly
focus
the
exemption
as
much
out
of
concern
for
consumers
down
their
distribution
chain
as
out
of
concern
for
the
farmers
themselves.
now
the
theme,
the
general
theme
of
the
language
plus
the
legislative
history
was
precisely
the
exercise
of
this
court
went
through
in
case-swayne
which
we
regard
as
definitive
in
the
explication
of
this
amendment,
this
exemption
and
let
me
just
call
attention
to
three
or
four
things
in
connection
with
case-swayne.
as
we
mentioned
earlier,
given
the
fact
that
two
of
the
members
of
nbma
are
neither
hatchery
owners
nor
breeder
flock
owners,
or
six
of
them
are
not,
and
two
in
addition
do
not
own
a
feed
processing
plants,
we
went
under
case-swayne
but
we
go
beyond
that.
once
you
look
at
the
reports,
particularly
house
report
number
24,
which
is
sided
in
our
brief,
the
debates
which
are
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
recounted
in
case-swayne,
the
phipps
amendment
which
is
set
out
in
a
footnote
in
case-swayne,
you
come,
it
seems
to
me
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
these
kinds
of
processors,
the
processors
that
were
orange
processors
in
case-swayne
and
one
similar
to
that
in
this
case
are
not
farmers
within
the
capper-volstead
act.
and
then
the
conclusion
that
case-swayne
reaches
is
particularly
instructive.
what
it
says
is
that
you
could,
it
seems
to
the
authors
of
the
opinion,
expand
the
exemption.
you
could
interpret
it
broadly,
but
because
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
capper-volstead
act
was
to
create
a
special
exception
to
a
general
rule,
to
a
general
legislative
plan,
the
exemption
is
to
be
narrowly
construed
and
that
is
set
out
in
full
at
389
u.s.
384.
so
we
argue
strongly
that
nbma
members
are
not
farmers,
because
they
do
not
meet
the
twin
standards,
ownership
of
the
land
or
working
at
the
land
and
if
that
is
the
determining
standard,
both
in
the
language,
producers
of
agricultural
products
as
farmers,
it's
the
determining
standard
in
the
legislative
history,
you
simply
cannot
read
the
legislative
history
without
getting
that
clear
signal
and
it
is
the
determining
standard
in
cases
in
this
court
that
have
construed
that
statute.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
anything
necessarily
in
the
debates
which
would
rule
that
out
as
a
possibility.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
but
as
long
as
you
are
trying
to
divine
the
essence
of
what
that
congress
thought
farmers
were
interested
in
or
what
farmers
did,
it
had
to
do
with
not
necessarily
ownership
of
the
land,
but
actually
producing
the
crop,
being
involved
with
the
production
of
the
crop
or
the
shepherding
of
the
flocks.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
believe
there
is
a
separate
act
that
governs
fisheries.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
that's
exactly
correct.
and
as
i
understand
the
law
under
that
act,
it
is
roughly
parallel
to
the
law
on
to
this
one.
thus,
in
our
argument,
in
our
view
congress
in
1922
did
not
exempt
these
integrators
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
phipps
amendment
shows
that
to
the
extent
it
was
addressed
at
all,
the
resolution
was
that
they
were
not
exempt.
now
petitioner
argues
and
i
think
correctly
that
farming
has
changed
in
a
major
way
since
1922.
mr.
john
h.
shenefield
i
am
not
sure
that
much
has
changed.
the
same
in
general,
the
same
concern
in
the
house
of
the
legislature.
petitioners
in
effect
are
arguing
here
that
the
integrators
are
the
farmers
in
the
true
sense.
we
agree
that
the
poultry
business
has
changed,
but
we
say
two
things,
that
the
word
farmer
has
changed
not
a
whit
since
1922
and
the
intention
of
that
congress
has
apparently
not
changed.
the
fact
of
industry
change
of
evolving
business
circumstances
does
not
it
seems
to
me
provide
an
adequate
basis
on
which
to
reverse
a
choice
rather
self-consciously
made
by
congress.
in
the
sisson
case,
this
court
wrote
that
language
is
not
a
vessel
into
which
you
can
pour
a
vintage
that
better
suits
present
day
tastes.
petitioners'
argument
that
the
integrators
must
be,
deserved
to
be
and
must
be
treated
as
farmers,
it
seems
to
me
should
be
addressed
to
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
the
67th
congress
which
passed
the
capper-volstead
act
made
his
views
plain
enough.
thank
you.
