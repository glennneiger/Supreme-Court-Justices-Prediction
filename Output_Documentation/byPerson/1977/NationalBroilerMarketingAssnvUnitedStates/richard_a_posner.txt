mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit,
is
a
government
civil
antitrust
suit
charging
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
against
an
agricultural
cooperative,
the
national
broiler
marketing
association
or
nbma.
nbma
is
a
cooperative
of
producers
of
broiler
chickens.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
nbma
and
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
basis
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
that
act
grants
a
limited
antitrust
exemption
to
agricultural
cooperatives
composed
of
"persons
engaged
in
agricultural
production
as
farmers,
planters,
ranchmen,
dairymen,
nut
or
fruit
growers".
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
because
some
of
nbma's
members
contract
out
the
so
called
grow
out
phase
of
broiler
production
to
independent
contractors
known
as
contract
growers.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
such
a
producer
is
not
entitled
to
join
an
exempt
cooperative.
certain
key
issues
are
not
in
dispute
here.
for
example,
it
is
not
disputed
that
a
broiler
chicken
is
an
agriculture
product
under
the
capper-volstead
act.
thus
we
are
not
concerned
with
producers
of
hotdogs
or
flour,
refined
sugar,
textile
products
or
other
manufactured
products.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
marketing
organization
itself,
the
cooperative,
is
not
engaged
in
sale
other
than
some
export
sales.
the
actual
sales
are
made
by
the
producer
members.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
has
several
functions,
one
that
it
has;
that
many
cooperatives
have,
it
purchases
products
on
behalf
of
its
members,
buys
for
them
to
get
lower
prices.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
it
will
buy
various
equipments
used
in
production
and
other
supplies.
it
also
makes
some
export
sales
and
it
engages
in
dissemination
of
information
and
other
trade
association
like
activities.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
product
is
a
broiler
chicken
which
has
been
plucked
and
eviscerated
and
its
head
and
feet
cut
off
and
it
is
then
sold
afresh
to
the
grocery
stores
or
supermarkets.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
plucked
chicken
and
as
long
as
the
chicken
itself
is
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
processing
of
beef
to
answer
the
question
fully.
one
difference
is
that
as
i
understand
it
most
beef
has
been
substantially
sliced
and
segmented
and
dismembered
before
it's
actually
shipped
from
a
meat
packing
plant,
but
here
the
chicken
is
basically
just
a
plucked
and
eviscerated
beast.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
a
slaughter
house.
it
is
often
called
a
processing
plant.
i
think
there
is
a
profound
difference
between
what
is
done
to
prepare
the
bird
for
market
and
what
for
example
is
done
to
manufacture
sugar
or
hotdogs
or
the
likes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
a
great
deal
about
the
processing
of
beef,
if
all
it
was
involved
was
taking
a
steer,
killing
it
and
shipping
the
meat
to
a
grocery
store,
a
supermarket
and
if
that
meat
packer
or
meat
preparer
for
market
engaged
in
the
various
activities
that
these
producers
do,
and
i
assume
it
would
be
also
entitled
to
form
this
type
of
cooperative,
i
do
want
to
differentiate
though
very
sharply
the
kind
of
manufactured
product
of
which
hotdogs,
flour,
or
sugar
made
from
wheat
would
be
good
examples,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
capper-volstead
act
was
not
intended
to
allow
manufacturers
in
that
sense
to
form
a
cooperative.
that
would
not
be
an
agricultural
product
in
the
sense
used
in
this
act.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
record,
the
main
part
of
the
record
is
a
brief
stipulation
of
facts,
pages
6
to
30
of
volume
1.
there
is
not
a
detail
description
of
what
exactly
is
done
at
a
processing
plant.
however,
what
is
described
and
conceded
as
the
agricultural
product
here
is
a
ready
to
cook
broiler,
90
and
more
percent
of
which
are
shipped
fresh
from
the
slaughter
house
and
the
activities
in
the
slaughter
house
are
the
plucking
of
the
feathers
and
the
evisceration.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
some
times,
as
i
understand
it,
some
times
the
producer
will
dismember
the
chicken
and
ship
parts.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
record
does
not
–
no
it
does
not
give
that
degree
of
detail.
another
conceded
point,
i
hope
less
controversial
with
the
justices,
is
that
a
completely
integrated
broiler
producer
that
is
one
who
does
his
own
growing
is
a
farmer
under
the
capper-volstead
act
and
this
concession
disposes
of
any
argument
that
this
is
a
statute
just
to
protect
the
little
farmer,
the
dirt
farmer.
the
fully
vertically
integrated
producer
is
fully
within
the
act.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
true.
if
what
the
meat
packer
is
shipping,
is
selling
is
definable
as
a
raw
or
original
agricultural
commodity.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
if
it
is
merely
killed
and
sliced,
it
would
retain
its
original
agricultural
character.
if
it
were
processed
into
lunch
meats
or
hotdogs
or
hamburgers
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
it
would
be
a
manufacture.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
actually
there
are
very
few
decided
cases
under
the
capper-volstead
act
in
the
entire
history
of
the
act
and
in
those
cases
these
issues
have
not
occurred,
have
not
been
raised.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
a
producer
who
does
not
control
a
breeder
flock
and
it's
important
to
distinguish
a
breeder
flock
from
a
broiler
flock.
a
breeder
flock;
that
is
the
parents
of
the
broiler
chicken,
breeder
flocks
are
the
pullets
who
produce
eggs
which
are
then
hatched.
now
a
producer
who
does
not
have
a
breeder
flock
might
for
example
have
a
hatchery,
and
that
would
mean
he
would
purchase
the
eggs
from
the
owner
of
the
breeder
flock.
those
eggs
he
would
hatch
in
his
hatchery.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
he
would
take
the
chicks
from
the
hatchery
and
place
them
with
the
grower
and
he
would
supervise
the
growing
of
the
chickens,
send
his
personnel
to
supervise
them,
ship
them,
feed,
capture,
catch
and
coop
the
chickens
after
the
grow
out
stage
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
there
is
no
question
that
–
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
differences
between
these
producers
are
not
material
producers.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
have
no
particular
difficulty
with
the
ones
that
do
not
have
a
breeder
flock
or
do
not
have
a
processing
plant.
i
don't
think
those
are
the
essential
elements
of
being
a
producer
or
being
a
farmer.
the
essential
element
is
the
ownership
of
the
broilers
from
chick
to
when
they
are
ready
for
the
market,
taking
the
market
risk,
using
your
personnel
to
place
the
chicks,
to
supervise
the
growing,
to
pick
up
the
chicks,
coop
them,
haul
them
off,
and
to
furnish
the
feed
and
those
responsibilities
are
assumed
by
all
of
the
producers.
the
fact
that
some
of
them
may
not
have
a
particular
type
of
plant
which
most
of
them
have
is
not
material.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
the
essence
of
a
farmer
is
not
the
ownership
of
a
feed
mill
or
a
slaughter
house
or
a
breeder
flock
that
is
the
parents
of
the
agricultural
commodity
or
flock
in
which
we
were
interested.
therefore,
i
don't
regard
the
fact
that
some
of
these
producers
don't
have
all
of
the
plants
which
are
typical
in
this
industry
as
harmful
to
our
position.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
it
does
not.
there
is
a
footnote
on
page
21
of
the
government's
brief,
footnote
42,
which
states
the
department's
current
position
on
two
statutes
discussed
in
that
footnote,
neither
of
which
is
the
capper-volstead
act,
both
are
statutes
under
which
these
producers
have
received
other
forms
of
assistance
from
the
agriculture
department.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
you
may
be
referring
to
the
brief
in
opposition,
but
the
brief
for
the
united
states
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
i
am
so
sorry.
let
me
take
another
moment
to
describe
what
these
producers
do
and
why
we
think
they
are
farmers.
and
here
i
will
discuss
the
typical
member,
the
integrator,
although
there
is
some
difference
among
them.
i
stress
the
–
starting
with,
when
the
chicken
is
born
at
the
hatchery,
at
the
point
for
all
of
these,
all
the
members
of
this
cooperative,
they
own
those
baby
chicks
and
they
will
own
the
chickens
throughout
until
it's
sold
to
the
supermarket.
they
take
the
chicks
to
a
grower,
when
the
chicks
are
a
day
old,
they
haul
the
new
born
chicks
–
well,
more
concretely
to
a
poultry
house
and
that
is
where
the
chickens
are
going
to
grow
for
7
or
8
weeks
until
they
are
ready
for
slaughter.
and
this
is
the
grow-out
stage
and
a
poultry
house
will
house
up
to
45,000
chickens
at
one
time.
sometimes
the
integrator,
the
producer,
the
member
of
the
cooperative
owns
the
poultry
house
themselves.
when
that's
true
then
he
is
uncontrovertibly
the
capper-volstead
farmer.
more
commonly
the
poultry
house
is
owned
by
these
contract
growers,
independent
contractors.
and
the
grower
then
has
the
custody
of
the
chickens
for
the
7
or
8
weeks
while
they
are
growing.
it
doesn't
follow,
however,
that
the
integrator
relinquishes
his
control
of
the
chickens
during
this
period.
of
course
he
owns
them
throughout
and
bears
the
market
risks,
but
in
addition,
he
supplies
and
delivers
the
feed
for
the
chickens
and
feed
is
the
major
input
into
the
production
of
a
chicken.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct,
he
supplies
them
with
all
medicines,
vaccines,
he
inoculates
the
chickens,
he
tells
the
grower
what
diet,
what
mixture
of
feeds
to
administer
the
chickens
at
different
periods
of
their
growth.
his
employees,
field
men
or
supervisors
as
they
are
called,
visit
the
grower
weekly
to
supervise
the
growing
of
the
chickens.
and
at
the
end
of
the
7
or
8
weeks
when
they
are
mature,
the
integrator
sends
his
employees
to
catch
the
birds,
coop
them
and
truck
the
cooped
birds
to
the
slaughter
house.
and
these
employees
who
catch
and
coop
the
birds
like
the
field
men
who
visit
the
grower
weekly
are
as
much
farm
labors,
as
the
grower
himself
and
is
hired
help.
if
we
look
just
at
the
costs
which
are
incurred
in
the
live
production
stage
before
you
get
to
the
slaughter
house,
the
integrator
incurs
90%
of
those
costs
and
the
grower
only
10%.
if
you
add
it
in
the
slaughtering
costs,
which
is
done
entirely
by
the
integrator
then
his
percentage
of
cost
is
even
higher.
because
broilers
are
your
typical
perishable
agricultural
product,
because
these
producers
are
not
well
informed
about
conditions
of
demand
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
owner
of
the
chicken
is
the
producer,
not
the
grower.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
he
does
not.
if
the
–
there
is
as
far
as
i
know
no
substantial
market
for
a
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
was
going
to
say,
there
is
no
market
as
far
as
i
know
for
the
un-plucked
chicken,
but
in
addition
to
that
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
a
fryer
and
a
broiler
are
identical;
they
are
the
same
young
chicken.
if
you
let
the
chicken
stay
and
grow,
he
becomes
unmarketable.
there
is
some
market
for
roast
chicken
which
is
a
larger
chicken,
but
ordinarily
if
the
chickens
are
allowed
to
grow,
as
they
can't
be
sold
after
8
weeks,
they
are
generally
written
off,
they
are
a
loss.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
only
thing
that
is
contracted
out
is
the
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
give
to
the
retail
store.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
it
doesn't,
typically
it
does
not
work
that
way
as
i
understand
it.
the
details
of
the
relationships
with
the
supermarkets
are
not
in
the
record.
what
the
record
does
say
is
that
the
retail
demand
for
the
chickens
is
unpredictable
and
variable.
and
sometimes
the
producer
will
find
himself
with
a
flock
that
he
must
sell
because
he
can't
let
them
grow
beyond
their
8
week
size
and
then
he
has
to
find
a
distress
outlet.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
for
reasons
that
are
not
explained
in
the
record
that
i
do
not
understand,
there
is
not
a
market,
there
is
not
a
substantial
market
for
frozen
chicken.
the
record
does
show
that
more
than
90%
of
the
chickens
sold
by
the
producers
are
shipped
fresh.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
fresh
unfrozen.
they
are
lightly
chilled
to
preserve
them
for
the
week
or
so
that
it
takes
to
be
sold
at
the
counter,
but
they
do
not
keep,
they
are
perishable.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yeah,
in
fact,
until
this
case
was
brought
the
grower
and
the
producer
were
both
the
conceded
farmers.
for
example,
this
producer
cooperative
contains
as
members
coops
of
growers
and
as
i
say,
until
the
case
there
was
no
suggestion
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
problem
that's
happened
with
poultry
production
is
that
the
attributes
of
a
complete
or
traditional
farmer
have
become
divided
between
two
entities;
the
grower
has
some,
in
the
sense
that
he
actually
has
the
day
to
day
custody
of
the
birds.
the
integrator
has,
we
would
argue
more
or
at
least
as
many,
because
he
bears
the
market
risk,
he
markets
the
birds,
he
supervises
them,
he
formulates
their
diet,
he
inoculates
them
and
does
many
of
the
things
which
in
traditional
agriculture
are
the
farmer's
job.
the
justice
department
and
the
court
below
have
said
the
only
thing
that
counts
in
whether
a
firm
is
a
farmer,
is
whether
it
has
ownership
of
the
land
or
custody
of
a
crop,
and
we
say
that's
just
a
rule
to
decide
this
case,
can
be
very
easily
circumvented
simply
by
rewriting
the
contract
with
the
growers
to
designate
them
as
employees
and
this
court
has
had
experience
with
the
difficulty
of
a
rule
which
turns
on
the
concept
of
title.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
that
would
fall
under
the
government's
--
under
the
branch
of
the
government's
rule
for
which
the
person
with
custody
is
a
farmer,
and
the
person
with
title
of
the
land
is
another
farmer,
thus
the
plantation
owner
and
the
tenant
farmer.
in
the
poultry
case
the
ownership
of
the
land,
that
is
to
say
the
land
under
the
poultry
house
is
in
the
grower
and
the
custody
is
in
the
grower
that
really
divided
with
the
integrator.
but
if
these
contracts
with
the
growers
were
rewritten
so
that
the
growers
become
employees,
then
under
the
justice
department's
test,
the
integrated
producers
would
become
farmers.
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief
that
the
trend
in
poultry
production
is
toward
the
complete
integration
of
the
operation
under
the
integrator.
two
of
the
members
of
the
cooperative
grow
a
100%
of
their
own
birds,
143%.
still
most
place
most
of
their
birds
with
outside
growers
and
yet
that
is
a
situation
that
is
changing
in
the
direction
of
greater
integration
and
if
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
were
upheld
that
would
just
give
the
producers
an
additional
impetus
to
continue
this
trend
of
buying
out
growers.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
balance
of
time.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
thank
you.
i
will
be
very
brief.
i
think
mr.
shenefield
made
a
critical
concession
when
he
said
that
hydro
agronomy,
growing
plants
in
test
tubes
what
general
electrical
is
doing
now
is
agriculture,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
even
though
it
doesn't
involve
soil
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
he
said,
i
thought
he
concede
that,
i
think
he
next
said,
what
is
required
is
being
involved
with
the
production
of
an
agriculture
commodity
and
that's
what
these
integrators
are.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
or
owning
the
water
and
let
me
add
with
regard
to
the
phipps
amendment
which
keeps
cropping
up,
the
phipps
amendment
said,
someone
who
made
flour
was
not
an
agriculture
producer
merely
because
he
had
a
deal
with
a
wheat
farmer
that
gave
him
a
percentage
of
the
crop.
it
has
to
do
with
what
is
an
agricultural
product
and
the
difference
between
a
raw
agricultural
product
and
a
manufactured
product,
which
is
not
within
the
scope
of
capper-volstead
even
though
it
is
produced
from
agricultural
inputs.
and
finally,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
nothing
in
the
capper–volstead
act
that
requires
a
cooperative
to
have
a
marketing
agent.
the
statute
permits
producers
to
act
together
in
processing
and
marketing
their
product
and
one
form
of
acting
together
is
the
exchange
of
information.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow,
but
if
the
justice
department
concedes
as
it
has
that
the
activities
of
the
petitioner,
of
nbma,
are
exempt
if
they
are
producers
subject
to
capper–volstead
act
that
to
us
establishes
that
this
is
a
completely
legitimate
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
that
issue
has
not
been
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
the
issue
has
not
been
decided
in
this
court.
there
are
lower
court
cases
cited
in
the
district
court's
opinion
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
let
me
give
you
just
one
example.
this
case,
the
nbma
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
it
did.
it
did
not
however
proscribe
the
precise
activities
of
coops.
for
example,
three
of
the
members
of
nbma
are
grower
coops.
they
do
not
have
a
common
marketing
agent
because
they
don't
have
anything
to
market,
they
are
not
selling
anything.
but,
they
have
a
coop
for
purposes
of
negotiating
with
the
integrators
indeed,
the
cooperative,
the
agricultural
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
do
buying,
they
do
export
sales.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
do
export
sales
and
surplus
sales.
but
as
i
say,
the
growers
do
not
have
a
marketing
agent
and
yet
their
legitimacy
as
coops
has
never
been
questioned.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
it
is
not
a
marketing
agent
because
they
are
not
engaged
in
marketing
since
they
do
not
have
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
the
record
does
show
that
it
engages
in
marketing,
in
export
trade
and
of
surplus
chickens.
and
i
might
add
the
record
is
brief
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
commendably
so,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
it
enabled
this
case
to
be
disposed
off
rapidly
and
there
isn't
any
fact
which
this
court
needs
to
know
that
isn't
in
the
record
which
establishes
that
these
are
producers
within
the
meeting
of
the
capper–volstead
act.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
