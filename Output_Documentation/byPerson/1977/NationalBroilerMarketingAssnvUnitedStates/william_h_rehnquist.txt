h.
rehnquist
mr.
posner,
i
find
some
difficulty
along
the
same
lines
expressed
by
justice
stevens
and
the
chief
justice,
as
to
the
precise
facts
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
is
there
some
place
in
the
record
or
the
parties
sufficiently
agree
so
that
it
quickly
summarizes
to
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
members
of
the
association
ship
to
safeway
or
amp
and
then
what
more
typically
amp
or
safeway
does
before
they
put
them
out
on
their
retail
shelves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
frequently
if
you
look
on
a
safeway
shelf
you
will
see
chicken
breasts
or
chicken
legs
and
as
you
get
to
think
more
has
happened
from
the
time
that
the
bird
was
shipped
by
the
processor,
to
the
time
those
things
appear
on
the
shelves
in
that
form?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
isn't
clear
from
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
their
intent
also
to
treat
as
differently
under
the
antitrust
laws,
farmers
because
they
bore
the
risks
of
drought
and
price
depressions
in
a
way
that
lots
of
other
purchasers
didn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
one
of
the
reasons
that
farmers
were
leaving
the
farms
just
because
of
this
agriculture
depression,
whereas
other
parts
of
industry
were
prosperous
and
that
was
because
farmers
suffered
from
these
peculiar
risks.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
case
to
me
mr.
shenefield
is
that
the
record
is
so
sparse
as
to
actual
facts,
i
realize
that
the
complaint
and
stipulated
facts
and
no
trial,
but
it
seems
inevitably
the
discussion
does
turn
to
what
these
people
are
doing,
and
not
all
of
us
at
least
are
sure
of
what
they
are
doing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
group
of
lawyers
trying
to
talk
about
what
farmers
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
we're
the
ultimate
judges
of
that
then.
