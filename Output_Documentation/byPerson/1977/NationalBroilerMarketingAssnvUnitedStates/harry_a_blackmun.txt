harry

well
that
has
to
be
your
position,
doesn't
it
professor
posner
that
you
have
no
difficulty
whether
they
are
--
otherwise
your
case
goes
down
the
drain.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
dispose
incidentally
the
attitude
of
the
department
of
agriculture
as
to
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
capper-volstead
act?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
if
the
integrator
owned
the
land
where
the
chickens
matured
here,
and
then
you
can
say
that
he
would
be
a
farmer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
much
land
does
he
have
to
own?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
for
ownership
only
a
part
is
enough,
then
why
isn't
it
sufficient
if
the
integrator
owns
the
land
for
the
breeding
flocks
and
the
hatchery
facilities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
why
don't
you
go
off
on
case-swayne?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
certainly
don't
put
it
forward
as
your
main
thrust?
justice
harry

blackmun
this
is
the
antitrust
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
the
application
of
antitrust
principles
in
the
face
of
an
old
statute
called
the
capper-volstead
act,
which
was
placed
on
the
statute
book
some
56
years
ago
in
1922.
the
united
states
brought
this
suit
against
the
petitioner,
the
national
broiler
marketing
association
a
non-profit
cooperative,
the
members
of
which
are
called
integrated
producers
of
broiler
chickens.
the
allegations
where
that
they
petitioner
had
conspired
with
others,
including
its
members
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
defense
stated
where
is
up
the
petitioners
activities
with
its
members
were
sheltered
under
the
capper-volstead
act
which
specifically
permits
persons
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
as
farmers,
to
join
in
cooperative
associations.
so
the
issue
is
whether
the
members
of
the
association
are
farmers
within
the
meaning
of
this
rather
old
statute.
the
united
state
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
held
that
the
activities
of
the
members
of
the
association
had
justified
their
classification
as
farmers
and
that
the
protection
afforded
by
the
capper-volstead
act
was
therefore
available.
the
court
of
appeals
however
reversed,
it
held
that
not
all
of
the
members
of
the
association
were
farmers
and
the
ordinary
meaning
of
that
word
as
it
resumes
up
the
time
the
capper-volstead
act
it
was
passed
in
the
1920s.
if
in
fact
not
all
the
members
of
the
association
qualifiers
farmers
then
it
is
the
accepted
law
that
the
association
is
not
entitled
to
the
protection,
when
the
antitrust
laws
afforded
by
the
capper-volstead
act.
we
have
examined
the
legislative
history
we
find
that
the
language
of
the
act
reveals
that
not
all
persons
engaged
in
the
production
of
agricultural
products
as
such
are
entitled
to
form
cooperatives
protected
by
that
act.
congress
didn't
intend
the
protection
of
the
act
to
extend
to
processors
and
packers
to
whom
farmers
sold
their
goods,
even
though
the
processors
and
packers
bore
a
part
of
the
risks
of
a
fluctuating
agricultural
market.
members
of
the
association
who
own
neither
a
breeder
flock
nor
a
hatchery,
and
who
maintain
no
grow-out
facility
at
which
the
breeder
flocks
are
raised,
are
not
farmers
with
in
the
meaning
of
the
capper-volstead
act.
we
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
