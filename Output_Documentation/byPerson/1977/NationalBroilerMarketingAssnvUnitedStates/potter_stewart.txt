mr.
posner,
i
--
perhaps
you
have
covered
this
before,
but
it's
suggested
in
at
least
one
of
these
amicus
briefs
here
that
we
have,
that
there
is
a
choice
here,
an
alternative,
either
the
contract
growers
are
within
the
exception,
the
capper-volstead
exemption
from
the
antitrust
law
or
your
clients
somewhere
that
they
can't
both
be,
that's
--
but
you
reject
that,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
one
or
the
other
is,
and
if
one
is,
the
other
isn't,
that's
the
suggestion?

title,
well
there
is
no
title.
i
mean
farmers
are
surely
within
capper-volstead,
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
mean
literally
the
tilling
of
the
soil,
do
you,
i
mean
the
growing
of
the
chickens?
justice
potter
stewart
because
one
of
the
problems
is
the
extraordinary
technological
change
in
the
agricultural
â€“
it
is
now
called
agro
business,
that's
a
problem
not
unfamiliar
in
other
areas
of
the
law,
the
technological
change
that
made
the
1907
trademark,
copyright
law,
so
difficult
to
apply.
and
obviously
the
congress
back
in
1922
wasn't
thinking
of
anything
like
this
because
it
didn't
exist
and
they
probably
couldn't
and
didn't
image
that
they
ever
would.
chicken
raising
back
in
those
days
was
simply
done
by
the
farmer's
wives
or
the
egg
money.

mr.

why
we
have
changed

doesn't
have
to
be
these
days,
doesn't
have
to
be
land,
another
thing
can
be
water,
can
it,
hygroscopic
agronomy?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
couldn't
envision
any
such
thing
in
1922?
justice
potter

i
don't
know;
if
they
concede
that--
