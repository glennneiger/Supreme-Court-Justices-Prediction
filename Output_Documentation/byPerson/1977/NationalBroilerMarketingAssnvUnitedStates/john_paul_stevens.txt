justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
posner
i
understand
that
isn't
disputed,
but
frankly
i
was
kind
of
puzzled,
what
it
is
that
the
marketing
organization
sells
for
its
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
the
typical
coop
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
more
like
a
trade
association,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
buys
chicken
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
getting
back
to
my
original
question,
what
is
the
product
as
to
which
the
price
information
is
exchanged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
like
meat
that's
been
dressed
by
the
packers?
i
know
that
the
government
concedes
it,
but
i
frankly
couldn't
quite
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
gone
through
the
processing
plant,
isn't
it?
it's
been,
as
you
say,
eviscerated
and
the
head
cut
off,
isn't
that
just
like
a
piece
of
beef
that's
been
packed
for
sale
to
consumers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
gone
--
it
has
gone
through
a
processing
plant
much
like
a
slaughter
house
has,
isn't
it
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
i
am
sorry,
i
know
that
the
government
conceded
the
point,
but
i
just
don't
see
why
this
is
different
than
a
piece
of
meat.
well
i
shouldn't
take
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
concession
covers
again,
a
meat
packer
that
owned
up
the
ranch
plant
to
grow
its
own
cattle,
would
it
apply
or
would
there
be
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
fact
they
killed
it
and
chopped
it
up
in
pieces,
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
the
government
has
conceded,
are
they
any
cases
that
hold
that
this
kind
of
product
is
an
agriculture
product
and
this
kind
of
vertical
integrated
entity
is
a
farmer?
i
know
the
government
does
concede
it,
but
i
was
rather
surprised.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
more
and
then
i
will
leave
you,
why
isn't,
why
the
fact
that
two
members
don't
even
control
any
breeder
flocks,
under
case-swayne
why
doesn't
that
dispose
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
these
two
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
is
it
not
correct
mr.
posner
that
we
must
conclude
that
those
two
members
are
farmers
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
in
order
for
the
whole
coop
to
be
exempt
under
case-swayne?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
anyone
is
not
a
farmer
this
whole
defense
fails
if
i
understand
case-swayne,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
we
have
to
take
the
two
most
difficult
examples
from
your
point
of
view
and
satisfy
ourselves
that
those
are
farmers
in
order
for
the
coop
to
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
posner,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
that
occurred
to
me.
at
the
point
immediately
before
the
chicken
goes
to
the
slaughter
house,
to
the
processing
plant
while
they
are
still
alive,
does
the
owner
of
the
chicken
have
an
option
to
do
something
else
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
producer
have
an
option
to
do
something
other
than
kill
it
at
that
particular
stage
of
its
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
larger
chicken
and
–
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
–
these
are
two
and
half
pound
chicken;
they
are
something
like
that,
aren't
they?
couldn't
they
let
them
get
a
little
bigger
and
use
them
for
some
other
market
like
fryers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
posner,
i
can
understand
why
at
the
age
of
8
weeks
the
product
is
perishable
in
a
sense
it's
got
to
be
marketed
right
away,
but
after
it's
been,
chicken
has
been
killed
and
dressed,
why
can't
it
be
frozen
and
stored
indefinitely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
what
the
vertical
integration
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point
mr.
shenefield,
what
if
the
meat
packers
bought
up
a
lot
of
ranches
and
then
formed
this
kind
of
association,
would
they
be
exempt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
sold
it
just
unfrozen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
i
guess
there
wasn't
frozen
--
didn't
have
the
art
of
freezing
probably.
so
you
would
say
that
the
meat
packers
could
get
together
and
buy
some
ranches
and
enjoy
the
exemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
am
not
interrupting,
i
don't
know
--
have
you
finished
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
another
problem.
we've
talked
a
lot
about
what
the
legislators
might
have
been
thinking
about
between
the
debates,
but
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
talks
about
farming
association
to
act
as
marketing
agents
and
i
don't
understand
that
this
organization
does
that.
it
does
–
do
you
read
the
statute
as
permitting
if
you
--
they
had
a
group
of
farmers
who
presumably
could
form
a
cooperative
marketing
agent,
do
you
think
they
would
be
exempted,
if
instead
of
doing
that
they
just
agreed
on
prices
and
agreed
to
sell
independently
at
that
agreed
prices
and
that's
what
this
charge
is
i
believe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
but
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
these
activities
are
within
the
exemption,
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
concede
that
the
farmers
may
fix
prices
without
acting
through
a
marketing
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
don't
do
what
the
statute
exempts,
namely
act
through
a
marketing
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
complaint
doesn't
allege
activities
of
the
kind
described
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
allege,
nobody
tells
us
anything
about
a
marketing
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
shouldn't
you
be
arguing
that
in
this
court
today,
and
you
don't
seem
to
be
making
an
argument,
it
seems
wide
open
to
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
are
two
quite
separate
reasons
why
the
exemption
may
not
apply;
one,
because
they
are
not
farmers,
and
two,
because
even
if
they
are
farmers,
they
haven't
formed
a
statutory
marketing
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
have
another
good
argument
but
you're
not
particularly
interested
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
necessarily
follows
because
you
have
got
an
exemption
for
common
marketing
agent,
that
you
have
an
exemption
for
price
fixing
and
separate
individual
marketing?
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
does
it
and
can
you
read
the
statute
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
necessarily
establish
it
to
us
though,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
not
going
to
be
decided
by
any
court
and
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
compel
that
result,
it
may
be
right,
but
you
have
to
agree
with
that
i
believe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
rather
substantial
difference
between
the
businessman's
decision
of
whether
to
enter
into
a
price
fixing
agreement,
assuming
it's
all
legal,
and
his
decision
to
turn
over
all
his
marketing
activities
to
a
common
marketing
agent.
those
are
rather
different
forms
of
marketing,
are
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
also
not
true
that
the
legislative
history
shows
a
great
interest
in
the
cooperative
movement,
the
idea
of
trying
to
market
through
common
cooperative
agencies?
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
congress
specifically
intended
to,
to
give
its
approval
to
just
as
it
wanted
to
approve
union
organization
at
the
same
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
record
doesn't
tell
us
that
anybody
negotiates
on
behalf
of
all
the
members
of
this
association
with
anybody.
you've
told
us
they
do
some
buying
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
selling
of
the
broilers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
they
have
a
bargaining
representative
as
i
understand
who
bargains
for
them
and
negotiating
currently
with
the
processing
plants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing,
am
i
right,
and
this
is
summary
judgment
case,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
tell
us
that
this
association,
that's
a
defendant
here
does
any
common
marketing
on
behalf
of
its
members?
