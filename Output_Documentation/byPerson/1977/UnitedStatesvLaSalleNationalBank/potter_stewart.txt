justice
potter
stewart
in
reisman
v.
caplin,
mr.
wallace,
had
there
been
a
recommendation
for
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
called
for
a
criminal
purpose.
it
is
called
for
purpose
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
criminal
purpose
because
that
is
not
the
test.
justice
potter
stewart
a
third
party
would
not
have
many
constitutional
rights
to
assert.
these
are
third
party
summonses
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
decisions
are
that
when
the
bank
gives
up
a
lot
of
stuff,
it
might
incriminate
the
bank’s
customer.
nobody
can
erase
that.
the
bank
cannot
because
it
is
not
its
constitutional
rights
that
are
being
invaded
and
the
customer
cannot
because
it
is
not
his
material
that
is
being
summoned?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reply
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
it
is
the
government’s
position
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
7602,
an
investigation
solely
for
criminal
purposes
and
that
the
court
in
reisman
perhaps
and
donaldson
misapprehended
the
facts
of
life
when
it
assumed
there
was
such
a
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
guarantee
is
that
you
cannot
be
tried
criminally
in
the
federal
courts
except
by
indictment
of
a
grand
jury.
that
is
the
constitutional
guarantee.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
function
generally
welcomed
by
a
person
who
is
subsequently
indicted
by
a
grand
jury.
