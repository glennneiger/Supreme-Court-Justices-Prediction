justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
before
you
leave
judge
mcgarr’s
opinion,
he
does
say,
in
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
“it
is
apparent
that
the
agent
was
conducting
his
investigation
solely
purpose
of
unearthing
evidence
of
criminal
conduct.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
say
he
found
too,
is
it
not?
what
is
the
difference
between
judge
powell
and
judge
mcgarr?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
witness
said
it
was
for
some
other
purpose
when
the
district
court
says
it
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
criminal
proceedings
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
expect
us
to
decide
the
case?
should
we
assume
that
the
investigation
was
solely
for
criminal
purposes
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
he
said
that
is
what
may
happen
and
later
on,
he
says
what
did
happen
in
this
case
which
is
a
criminal
investigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
position.
is
the
government
not
arguing
that
even
if
judge
mcgarr
is
100%
right,
the
investigation
really
could
be
characterized
as
100%
criminal,
nevertheless,
no
recommendation
for
prosecution
had
been
made,
therefore,
there
is
a
pure
simple
rule
that
we
can
apply
under
the
presumption,
it
is
okay,
that
is
your
idea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
assume
there
is
and
you
would
make
the
same
argument,
would
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
theoretically
possible,
is
it
not,
that
there
could
be
an
absolutely
detailed
determination
of
tax
liability,
but
some
lacking
or
some
shortage
of
evidence
on
intent
and
you
are
looking
for
some
corporate
menage
or
something.
it
could
theoretically
be
such
a
case
and
you
would
say
you
could
still
enforce
the
summons
if
there
is
no
recommendation,
that
is
your
position,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
every
time
you
say
it
has
to
be
put
in
context,
you
are
going
to
say
you
got
to
have
a
factual
hearing
unless
you
got
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
the
dictum
in
reisman
really
could
be
read
to
refer
to
criminal
prosecution
other
than
for
violation
of
the
revenue
code,
it
is
clearly
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
realize
that.
why
is
it
improper
even
after
recommendation
for
prosecution
has
been
made,
if
the
agent
is
really
trying
to
check
up
on
a
violation
of
revenue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
would
be
so
strange
about
construing
the
statute?
suppose
congress
had
said
in
plain
black-and-white
that
these
summonses
are
available
in
criminal
investigations
as
well
as
any
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cushner,
maybe
i
am
awfully
dense
on
this,
but
why
is
it
an
abuse
for
the
agent
to
take
the
statute
as
it
reads
and
just
say,
“i
can
go
and
get
some
information.
it
may
help
me
prosecute
this
man.”
what
in
the
statute
makes
that
an
abuse?
you
assume
that,
i
know
donaldson
seems
to,
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
respond
to
mr.
wallace’s
argument
that
tax
liability
is
a
broad
enough
concept
to
include
fraud
penalty
and
all
these
things
may
end
up
in
fraud
penalties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
tax
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
does
it
not
come
right
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
