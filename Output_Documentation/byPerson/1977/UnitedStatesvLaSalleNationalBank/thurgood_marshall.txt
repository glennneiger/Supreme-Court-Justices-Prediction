how
did
judge
mcgarr
go
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
government
lawyer
explain
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
did
not,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
are
we
going
to
say
the
judge
is
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
going
to
give
us
to
show
that
he
was
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
in
this
record,
but
i
know
what
you
say
was
not
a
rule
in
1965
because
in
a
case
of
the
second
circuit
there
were
two
agents
sitting
in
the
same
office,
one
of
them
civil
and
one
of
them
criminal
on
the
same
name,
has
that
changed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
that
injure
your
client,
if
he
did
not
have
any
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
give
a
hypothetical
case.
a
man
forges
documents
and
promotes
himself
from
forth
assistant
janitor
to
a
regional
counsel
of
internal
revenue
and
served
you
with
a
subpoena,
how
are
you
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
you
require,
but
if
he
gets
them,
how
are
you
hurt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand,
if
a
man
in
government
gets
as
much
as
he
can
get
legally,
but
is
prevented
from
doing
anything
with
it,
there
is
no
way,
as
i
understand
it,
that
an
investigator
on
the
civil
side
can
participate
on
the
criminal
side
in
internal
revenue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
agent
here
on
the
civil
side?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
be
the
reason
for
that
sentence
about
him
going
side
by
side.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
get
to
the
criminal
prosecution,
you
use
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
the
same
thing,
the
us
attorney
has
got
them
right
in
his
desk
drawer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
not
brought
into
the
grand
jury,
you
are
brought
into
the
us
attorneyâ€™s
office
and
questioned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
sometimes
the
case,
yes,
but
defense
counsel
does.
