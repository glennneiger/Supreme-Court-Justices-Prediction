chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
lasalle
national
bank.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
court
not
be
as
free
as
the
court
of
appeals’
would
have
been
to
say
that
absent
contrary
testimony
or
some
affirmative
testimony
finding
by
district
judge,
his
finding
on
this
subject
was
clearly
erroneous.
is
that
not
one
of
the
alternatives
open?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
bright
line
that
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
would
readily
understand,
would
it
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cushner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
put
it
in
another
way,
if
the
line
that
you
later
decide
whether
that
is
a
bright
line
is
when
the
recommendation
is
made
with
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecution,
if
that
is
the
line
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
make
no
difference
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
agent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
assuming
that
there
is
a
bright
line
in
fact
at
all
times
in
the
mind
of
the
inquiring
agent
as
there
is
a
bright
line
if
we
draw
the
line
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
you
had
a
situation
where
some
people
involved
with
knowledge
of
the
inquiry,
had
as
their
objective,
the
prospect
of
the
criminal
prosecution
and
others
did
not?
what
about
that?
would
that
taint
the
whole
summons
because
someone
in
the
internal
revenue
service
thought
there
was
a
criminal
liability
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
assuming
all
the
way
through
your
argument,
mr.
cushner,
that
there
is
a
bright
and
clear
line
when
an
inquiry
moves
from
a
civil
into
a
criminal,
but
is
it
not
a
realistic
fact
that
many,
many
inquiries
start
out
both
in
the
tax
field
and
other
areas,
fraud
against
the
government,
start
out
on
a
purely
civil
liability
basis
and
move
on
and
become
criminal
prosecutions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suggested
three
times
now,
i
think,
that
the
agent
is
in
fact
given
the
powers
to
the
grand
jury.
he
has
such
no
powers.
his
recommendations
do
not
have
to
be
accepted.
the
grand
jury’s
recommendations
do.
they
become
an
indictment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
become
an
indictment,
but
the
agent’s
recommendations
may
be
accepted
or
rejected
by
his
superiors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
impermissible
under
the
statute
or
under
constitutionally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
a
man
shoots
a
police
official
or
someone
else
in
the
presence
of
12
bishops,
the
grand
jury
inquiry
is
not
very
meaningful
either,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
grand
jury
is
not
a
universal
absolute
protection
against
being
charged,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
offense
may
have
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
lasalle
national
bank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
three
minutes
left,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
