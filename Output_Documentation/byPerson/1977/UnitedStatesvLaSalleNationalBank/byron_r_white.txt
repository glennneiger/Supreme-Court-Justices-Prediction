justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
all
we
have
got
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
here,
is
it
not?
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you
might
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
a
summons
in
a
criminal
investigation,
but
that
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
how
the
statute
is
to
be
construed,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
somebody
has
a
fifth
amendment
objection
to
complying
with
the
summons,
could
he
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
not
losing
your
constitutional
protection
just
because
of
what
the
statute
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
lot
of
people
in
criminal
cases
are
served
with
subpoenas
to
produce
evidence
and
you
do
not
think
you
are
violating
the
constitution
just
because
you
are
subpoenaing
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
and
if
somebody
has
an
some
objection
to
the
subpoena
that
he
can
find
on
some
constitutional
basis
he
can
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
you
subpoena
somebody
to
produce
records
that
he
think
will
incriminate
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
your
argument
be?
you
say
you
cannot
think
of
some
constitutional
provision.
you
just
cite
abel?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
cannot
indict
anybody.
it
would
still
have
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
i
am
a
us
attorney
and
the
grand
jury
is
investigating
a
particular
person
and
i
have
not
filed
a
charge
against
him,
but
he
is
certainly
my
target,
so
i
issue
a
subpoena
to
him
to
come
and
testify
and
to
bring
some
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
summons
them
to
come
and
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
using
the
subpoena
in
connection
with
the
criminal
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
the
statute
in
this
case
has
said
on
its
face
that
up
until
the
time
a
reference
for
a
criminal
prosecution
has
been
made,
summonses
may
issue
as
that
statute
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
because
you
think
it
is
running
in
and
run
around
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
could
certainly
make
the
same
objections
to
the
agent
as
you
could
do
a
grand
jury,
hence
furthermore
your
lawyer
is
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
taxpayer?
can
he
take
his
lawyer
with
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
would
be
worried
at
all,
he
does,
does
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
does
not
have
to
go
alone
anyway
like
he
does
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
by
his
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
10a.
you
do
not
mean
10a,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
cannot
find
what
you
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
thank
you.
