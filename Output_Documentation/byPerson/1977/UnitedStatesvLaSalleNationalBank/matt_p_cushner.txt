mr.
matt
p.
cushner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
counsel’s
arguments
before
i
make
my
presentation.
counsel
indicated
in
his
opening
that
the
finding
of
judge
mcgarr
was
suspect
in
view
of
the
fact
there
seem
to
be
no
contradiction
in
the
testimony.
i
think
viewing
the
appendix
that
has
been
filed
with
the
court
in
this
case,
particularly
page
52,
we
find
mr.
perry
testifying
exactly
opposite
to
the
testimony
of
special
agent
olivero
concerning
his
purpose
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
summons.
special
agent
olivero
met
with
mr.
perry
and
at
the
time
testified
that
he
had
no
civil
purpose.
mr.
perry
testified
to
that
conversation.
it
seems
anomalous
that
we
would
be
in
front
of
the
supreme
court
arguing
an
evidentiary
question
that
has
been
cited
by
the
district
court
after
hearing
witnesses,
viewing
their
demeanor,
being
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
finding
in
the
unanimous
decision
that
there
was
more
than
adequate
support
in
the
record
for
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
if
an
internal
revenue
summons
may
be
issued
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation
and
that
is
authorized
not
only
by
the
statute,
but
is
constitutionally
permissible
then
the
evidentiary
question
would
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
yes,
if
that
is
the
line.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
would
agree,
if
that
is
the
line.
the
problem
is
that
if
that
is
the
line,
what
is
the
reason
for
judicial
review
and
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
investigation
before
the
recommendation
or
after
the
recommendation?
if
the
summons
is
proper
before
a
recommendation,
why
is
not
proper
afterwards?
no
criminal
prosecution
is
necessarily
an
essay
after
the
issuance
of
a
recommendation
to
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
no,
i
suggest
in
this
case
there
was
such
a
line.
i
think
we
are
not
talking
about
generally.
all
the
summonses
that
are
issued
all
over
the
united
states
in
every
case,
i
think
this
is
the
most
peculiar
case
with
the
most
peculiar
set
of
facts
that
has
been
found
that
way.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
it
is
because
someone
in
the
internal
revenue
service
thought
there
was
a
possibility
or
thought
there
was
equivocal
violation.
i
think
it
is
the
agent
who
is
conducting
the
investigation
and
it
is
the
agent
who
is
issuing
the
summons
as
here
in
question.
it
is
that
agent
who
we
must
look
to,
to
determine
the
type
of
investigation
that
is
being
conducted.
it
is
the
agent
who
issues
the
summons
and
it
is
the
agent
who
conducts
the
investigation.
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
manuals
may
prohibit
him
from
doing
certain
things
that
may
otherwise
be
in
access
of
the
statutory
powers
or
for
that
matter
unconstitutional
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
all
government
employees
or
for
that
matter
all
special
agents
follow
those.
i
think
the
testimony
is
uncontradicted
when
the
special
agent
was
asked
on
the
stand
whether
he
had
even
read
in
totality
his
manual
of
procedures,
the
special
agent
said
that
he
did
not
and
when
questioned
as
to
particular
procedures
that
were
mandated
in
that
manual,
said
that
he
did
not
follow
them
and
would
not
follow
them
with
what
he
called
home
ground
rules
were
to
the
contrary.
i
think
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
was
a
special
agent
running
an
investigation
for
purposes
far
in
excess
of
whatever
the
statutory
grant
may
be
and
certainly
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
that
this
is
a
most
peculiar
type
of
case
also
because
the
nature
of
the
record
sought.
we
have
here
records
sought
that
are
part
of
an
illinois
land
trust,
a
very
peculiar
way
to
hold
title.
the
identity
of
the
trustee
and
the
beneficiaries
is
very
closely
knit.
for
instance,
if
the
legal
and
equitable
title
holder
being
the
bank
were
sued
or
if
a
tort
was
committed
on
that
land,
the
bank
would
be
sued.
the
beneficiaries
are
required
to
bear
the
cost
of
the
defense
of
the
suit
and
ultimately
bear
whatever
tort
liability
there
is.
we
have
a
most
difficult
problem
in
that
whose
privacy,
whose
records,
who
is
the
right
person
to
object
to
this?
they
have
sought
records
from
the
bank.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think,
justice
marshall,
anytime
i
am
served
with
legal
process
i
have
a
right
to
inquire
as
to
whether
that
legal
process
is,
in
fact,
legal.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
anybody
who
is
required
to
comply
with
legal
process
which
is
in
fact
not
legal
is
hurt.
i
think
it
is
our
liberty.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
no,
this
was
a
special
agent
from
the
intelligence
division
which
is
now
known
as
the
criminal
enforcement
division.
there
was
not
cooperating
agent
from
the
audit
division
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
judge
mcgarr
recognized
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
no
audit
agent
did
not
preordain
the
result
that,
in
fact,
was
reached.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
it
could
be.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
involved.
i
think
that
if
the
court
reaches
the
statutory
question
and
says
that
the
statute
does
in
fact
authorize
the
issuance
of
a
summon
such
as
the
instant
summonses
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation,
we
run
into
the
problem
of
abel
v.
the
united
states.
i
think
justice
frankfurter
succinctly
stated
the
issue
in
that
case
where
the
question
before
the
court
was
use
of
administrative
warrant
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
evidence
or
the
alleged
purpose
of
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
it
is
not
a
matter
of
construing
the
statute.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
of
course,
he
could.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
we
lose
our
constitutional
protection
if
the
supreme
court
orders
the
compliance
with
summonses
issued
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation.
i
do
not
think
that
the
statute
authorizes
that,
but
if
the
court
should
find
that
the
statute
authorizes
the
issuance
of
summonses
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation,
forcing
people
to
comply
with
such
summonses,
i
feel
is
unconstitutional,
obviously
if
the
court
finds
it
to
be
constitutionally
the
argument
is
mooted.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
to
be
frank
with
the
court,
i
cannot
point
to
a
specific
provision.
justice
frankfurter
did
not
point
to
a
specific
provision.
i
do
not
think
any
of
the
courts
have.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
agree.
if
a
warrant
of
search
and
seizure
is
issued
in
order
to
get
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
either
grand
jury
or
the
warrant
of
search
and
seizure.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
well,
i
think
then
we
would
have
a
very
clear-cut
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional
to
authorize
a
special
agent.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
no,
i
would
cite
abel
and
my
argument
would
be
that
the
special
agent
is
being
authorized
by
the
statute
to
conduct
a
grand
jury
without
the
protection
that
is
afforded
by
a
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
is
made
up
of
citizens
when
they
vote
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
true
bill
shall
issue.
they
sit
there
alone
and
they
deliberate.
it
is
not
a
man
charged
with
the
prosecution.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
speaking
of
the
grand
jury,
the
counsel
has
cited
to
the
court
statistics
as
to
how
much
the
way
fraud
penalties
are
gotten.
i
think
the
more
interesting
statistic,
if
it
were
available,
would
be
how
many
grand
jury
subpoenas
are
actually
issued
in
tax
fraud
prosecutions.
almost
none
are
ever
issued.
there
are
no
statistics
on
it,
but
factually
there
are
none
almost
issued.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
by
the
time
the
special
agents
finish
developing
these
cases,
turn
them
over
to
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
justice
then
referring
them
down
to
local
us
attorney’s
office
for
present
it
to
a
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
has
almost
no
work
to
do.
they
do
not
issue
grand
jury
subpoenas.
warrants
of
search
and
seizure
do
not
issue.
these
summonses
are
in
fact
being
used
as
substitutes
for
warrants
of
search
and
seizure
and
substitutes
for
grand
jury
subpoenas.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
congress
can
authorize
something
that
can
be
unconstitutional.
i
do
not
think
they
have
authorized
it.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
exactly.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
you
are
correct,
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
is
the
problem
that
was
faced
by
the
people
in
miller.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
you
are
right.
i
think
intervention
becomes
a
meaningless
right
if
the
defenses
both
constitutional
and
statutory,
are
taken
away.
i
fail
to
see
the
purpose
of
judicial
review.
if
the
summons
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
unfettered,
i
fail
to
see
the
purpose
of
the
congress
when
enacting
the
statute
in
enacting
judicial
review.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
he
is
entitled
to,
if
he
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
laws
of
the
united
states,
to
be
prosecuted
in
conformance
with
those
systems
of
justices
that
have
grown
up
in
this
country,
the
grand
jury
and
the
warrant
of
search
and
seizure.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
has
ever
authorized
the
agencies
of
the
united
states
to
conduct
this
type
of
criminal
investigation.
the
purpose
of
enacting
the
statute
of
which
we
are
dealing
here
is
to
determine
the
really
correct
tax
liability.
there
has
been
no
finding
in
this
case
that
the
investigation
being
conducted
by
the
special
agent,
even
relates
to
tax.
this
is
a
very
peculiar
case
based
on
the
peculiar
facts
within
this
case
and
i
do
not
think
it
really
presents
a
question
other
than
the
way
it
has
been
presented
to
the
court
that
lends
itself
to
these
arguments.
the
special
agent
has
been
conducting
an
investigation.
it
is
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
his
conducting
a
special
investigation
even
of
tax
liability.
they
say
and
they
quote
various
cases
saying
that
there
had
not
been
tax
prosecutions
which
do
not
involve
the
payment
of
a
penalty
or
a
tax.
well,
such
is
not
the
case.
the
recent
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
of
devarko
which
did
not
deal
with
the
underpayment
of
the
tax
or
the
overpayment
of
the
tax,
but
merely
the
misstating
of
where
income
comes
from.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
can
investigate
taxpayers
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
collection
of
the
tax
and
i
think
devarko
is
just
one
example
of
it.
i
think
that
the
personal
purpose
of
the
agent
is
really
not
the
issue.
it
is
not
the
personal
purpose
generally.
the
purpose
of
this
agent,
initially
in
the
summons,
was
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation,
not
a
criminal
tax
investigation,
not
a
criminal
tax
investigation
with
the
possibility
of
a
civil
tax
penalty,
but
a
criminal
investigation
and
that
is
the
problem
that
we
face.
i
think
even
the
donaldson
case
gives
us
some
guidance.
i
think
donaldson
very
clearly
stated
that
the
issuance
of
a
summon
solely
in
aid
of
a
criminal
investigation
is
not
a
proper
purpose.
in
donaldson,
the
real
issue
before
the
court
was
intervention,
whether
mr.
donaldson
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
records
to
intervene.
the
court
decided
against
him,
but
mr.
donaldson
also
raised
going
through
the
manual,
going
through
the
code
of
the
federal
regulations,
the
general
duties
of
the
intelligence
division
to
prosecute
and
to
advance
criminal
cases.
the
court
i
think
correctly
stated
that
the
mere
fact
that
these
may
be
the
duties
does
not
inextricably
lead
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
the
court
did
not
want
to
deny
the
internal
revenue
service
because
of
these
provisions
the
right
to
issue
summonses.
neither
did
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
finding
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
finding
in
donaldson.
the
finding
in
this
case
is
not
merely
that
the
agent
was
going
ahead
with
a
legitimate
investigation.
the
point
of
the
findings
below
was
that
this
was
not
a
legitimate
investigation
in
furtherance
of
any
statutory
duty
or
any
statutory
right
that
this
agent
may
have
had
pursuant
to
the
statute.
if
judicial
review
is
to
have
any
viability
in
the
summons
cases,
the
mere
fact
that
the
tax
payers
or
people
summonsed
may
exercise
their
right
to
judicial
review
does
not
mean
that
judicial
review
somehow
becomes
something
disrespectful
of
the
processes
or
something
that
a
taxpayer
or
a
person
summoned
should
not
avail
themselves
of.
it
was
provided
for
just
to
prevent
just
this
type
of
abuse.
the
mechanical
application
that
the
petitioners
urge
upon
the
court
will
do
nothing
to
stop
these
abuses.
if
the
only
rule
is
merely
that
an
agent
has
not
recommend
it
to
his
superiors
and
his
superiors
to
the
department
of
justice,
that
criminal
prosecution
be
recommended
and
instituted,
the
only
thing
that
a
special
agent
need
do
is
hold
off
on
that
recommendation
as
they
do
now
until
the
criminal
case
is
completed
then
turn
it
over,
once
again
have
it
reviewed
by
regional
counsel
to
determine
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
prosecution
and
turn
it
over
to
the
department
of
justice.
there
is
nothing
magical
about
that
recommendation.
the
only
think
about
that
recommendation
is
that
it
is
clear
to
all.
once
that
recommendation
is
made,
the
obvious
focus,
the
obvious
purpose,
the
obvious
end
of
that
investigation
is
solely
criminal
in
nature.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
it
is
an
abuse
because
the
statute
was
passed
for
a
specific
purpose.
i
do
not
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
allow
the
agent
to
conduct
a
grand
jury.
i
think
the
agent
is
permitted
under
the
statute
to
issue
summonses
in
aid
of
determining
correct
tax
liability,
in
aid
of
determining
whether
or
not
incorrect
tax
liability
may
lead
to
criminal
prosecution
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
agree
they
may
end
up
in
fraud
penalties.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
that
is
tax
liability.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
it
does
come
within
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
that
is
not
the
facts
that
are
before
the
court.
that
was
not
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
nor
was
that
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
they
said
that
the
special
agent
had
nothing
more
than
focus
his
inquiry
on
the
criminal
activities
of
the
taxpayer,
not
the
criminal
tax
activities
of
the
taxpayer,
but
the
criminal
activities
of
the
taxpayer.
when
the
special
agent
was
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
using
the
summons
to
investigate
possible
18
united
states
code
1001
violation,
that
is
false
statements
to
the
government,
he
said
he
was
not,
but
now
that
we
had
mentioned
it,
he
would
not
make
such
inquiry.
it
is
clear
that
a
summons
cannot
be
issued
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
violations
of
the
criminal
statutes
under
18
united
states
code
exist,
but
the
agent
stated
on
the
stand
under
oath
that
now
we
had
suggested
it
to
him,
that
is
what
he
would
in
fact
do.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
you
are
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
and
the
indictment
can
be
withdrawn
and
has
been
withdrawn
in
many
cases.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
think
though
that
mr.
wallace
or
anyone
else
can
ever
point
to
a
case
in
which
a
special
agent
has
developed
an
adequate
criminal
case
in
which
that
recommendation
has
been
declined
nor
should
it
be.
the
point
is
whether
or
not
the
special
agent
may
conduct
solely
a
criminal
investigation.
the
court
has
found,
these
are
the
facts
that
determine
the
thrust
of
this
case,
the
court
has
found
that
this
agent
was
not
looking
for,
attempting
to
find,
investigating
anything
other
than
the
criminal
activities
of
the
taxpayer
and
whether
the
agent
may
be
authorized
to
do
that
or
not
is
not
the
question.
is
the
agent
authorized
to
issue
a
summons
in
furtherance
of
those
activities
and
that
is
what
is
impermissible.
i
do
not
think
any
court
has
ever
held
it.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
do
not
think
that
any
court
has
ever
held
that
it
is
permissible
under
either
and
i
think
it
is
impermissible
under
either
the
statutory
construction
of
7206
or
the
constitution.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
he
shows
up
and
i
tell
him
that
you
are
a
target,
give
him
a
warning,
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
that?
just
so
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice,
the
us
attorney
has
caused
a
grand
jury
subpoena
to
issue.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
that.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
that
is
the
proper
use
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
absolutely
not.
grand
jury
subpoena
is
the
proper
tool
to
be
used.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
then
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
if
you
allow
the
special
agent
to
conduct
a
solely
criminal
investigation
and
issue
a
summons
in
furtherance
of
it.
i
think
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
making
a
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
it
is
not
only
running
in
and
run
around
the
grand
jury,
i
think
by
using
a
summon
sole
in
aid
of
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
first
of
all,
you
can
always
make
the
same
objections.
the
grand
juries
are
empanelled
for
specific
purposes.
the
grand
jury
is
subject
to
abuse
and
at
times,
you
can
get
minutes
of
the
grand
jury.
when
a
special
agent
interviews
especially
third
party,
often
that
it
is
lost
for
all
times.
those
notes
of
interview
go
into
his
investigative
file,
almost
never
discoverable
by
any
defendant.
a
criminal
defendant
is
almost
never
aware
of
which
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
yes,
he
can.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
sometimes.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
he
does
not
have
to.
there
are
instances
when
they
do
go
alone.
there
are
instances
when
they
do
go
alone
and
not
adequately
warned.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
always
warned
by
the
lawyer.
i
think
that
even
the
citation
of
the
court
to
judge
friendly’s
opinion
really
begs
the
issue.
judge
friendly
first,
on
page
10a
of
the
appendix,
cites
right
out
of
donaldson
and
states
“when
so
read,
the
dictum
comes
into
proper
focus
as
applicable
to
the
situation
of
a
pending
criminal
charge
or
at
most
of
an
investigation
solely
for
criminal
purposes.”
then,
after
quoting
that
language
from
donaldson
which
distinctly
disapproves
an
investigation
solely
for
criminal
purposes,
analyses
the
holding
in
donaldson
and
which
to
seem
to
indicate
that
you
can
issue
a
summon
solely
for
criminal
purposes.
i
do
not
think
donaldson
ever
approved
that.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
mean
10a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
on
the
top
of
the
page
there
is
the
end
of
the
quotation
from
donaldson
which
has
a
semi-colon
in
the
second
line
and
then
starts
“when
so
read
--”
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
during
the
initial
argument
in
this
case
that
the
citation
to
the
manual
of
procedures,
the
general
makeup
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
very
little
help
in
deciding
any
individual
case
and
particularly
this
individual
case.
even
judge
friendly
found,
before
he
made
his
analysis
of
donaldson,
that
the
case
at
issue
before
judge
friendly
did
not
involve
an
investigation
solely
for
criminal
purposes,
but
found
exactly
to
the
contrary,
that
in
fact
there
was
a
joint
investigation
going
on
that
was
concerned
with
in
fact
of
the
civil
violation
as
well.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
that
is
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
agree.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
that
is
not
always
the
case.
that
is
sometimes
the
case.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
well,
defense
counsel
often
does
not
have
the
subpoenas.
but
defense
counsel
may,
at
times,
reach
the
minutes
to
the
grand
jury
and
may
at
times
attack
the
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
present.
also,
the
grand
jury
historically
has
been
setup
to
protect
to
stand
between
the
power
of
the
government
and
the
citizens
with
respect
to
the
accusatory
process.
i
do
not
think
that
such
guarantees
or
assurances
rest
with
the
special
agent
conducting
a
criminal
investigation.
i
think
that
is
wherein
the
constitutional
abuse
lies
even
assuming
we
can
get
past
of
what
i
feel
to
be
the
statutory
infirmities
of
the
conduct
of
the
special
agent
in
this
case.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
if
the
grand
jury
is
left
with
nothing
to
do,
i
think
the
guarantee
of
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
is
rendered
rather
meaningless.
i
think
the
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
after
the
special
agent
with
abuse
of
his
process,
gathers
evidence
that
a
grand
jury
would
historically
gather,
but
the
grand
jury
has
nothing
to
do
but
vote
a
true
bill.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
but
if
there
was
no
difference,
we
could
dispense
with
the
grand
jury
and
turn
all
the
government
agencies
loose
with
the
subpoena
power
that
is
now
resting
with
the
grand
jury,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
the
grand
jury
historically
has
a
place
in
our
criminal
system
of
justice.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
before
he
is
indicted,
the
grand
jury
also
historically
has
performed
a
function
of
gathering
the
evidence
through
a
subpoena.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
it
may
not
be
a
help,
but
at
least
it
is
in
conformance
with
the
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
that
is
correct,
but
prior
to
indictment
the
constitution
i
think,
comprehend
or
at
least
anticipates
that
the
grand
jury
performs
a
function
and
hopefully
that
function
would
be
a
meaningful
one
and
i
think
that
if
the
special
agent
is
allowed
use
of
that
--
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
do
not
think
anybody
who
receives
grand
jury
subpoenas
welcomes
them.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
no,
it
is
not
very
meaningful.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
no,
but
the
facts
here
are
not
one
where
some
tax
offense
occurred
in
the
presence
of
12
bishops.
mr.
matt
p.
cushner
i
think,
in
addition,
the
type
of
records
that
are
being
summonsed
here
would
contraindicate
any
tax
purpose
to
the
summons.
the
records
that
are
peculiar
to
an
illinois
land
trust
are
not
necessarily
those
which
would
be
relevant
to
an
inquiry
of
a
person’s
tax
return
or
whether
a
person
who
has
committed
a
crime
with
respect
to
that
tax
return.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
records
of
an
illinois
land
trust
basically
consist
of
the
trust
agreement
which
is
a
standard
form
and
is
standard
in
all
banks
in
illinois
and
the
letters
of
direction
either
to
take
title,
issue
or
sign
a
mortgage
and
those
kinds
of
things,
not
necessarily
relevant.
thank
you.
