rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
we
do
have
a
case
here
involving
a
particular
agent
and
a
particular
investigation
and
justice
stevens
asked
you
awhile
ago
about
whether
in
view
of
judge
mcgarr’s
finding
that
the
investigation
was
solely
for
criminal
purposes,
which
he
suggested
the
court
of
appeals
had
upheld
is
not
clearly
erroneous,
what
hypothesis
do
we
go
ahead
on
this
case?
the
people
of
the
organization
of
the
irs,
i
do
not
think,
are
very
helpful
to
answer
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
friendly’s
opinion
would
have
no
trouble
with
judge
mcgarr’s
finding,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
simply
would
have
said
i
can
accept
it
as
not
clearly
erroneous
and
nonetheless,
they
are
not
entitled.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
judge
friendly
is
right,
you
are
not
here
arguing
an
evidentiary
question
because
in
his
view
even
if
the
evidentiary
question
is
in
your
client’s
favor,
you
still
lose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
congress
has
authorized
it,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
congress
has
authorized
it,
this
is
just
a
question,
i
guess
justice
white
asked
you
moreover,
what
is
the
constitutional
objection
to
it
so
long
as
you
retain
your
right
to
object
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
to
particular
request
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
donaldson
not
say
that
the
real
party
of
interest
can
intervene
in
a
proceeding
with
bank
records
or
summons
that
really
are
not
the
bank’s?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
the
summon
is
served
on
the
bank,
your
client
comes
in
under
donaldson
and
intervenes
and
is
permitted
to
raise
any
fifth
amendment
of
self-incriminating
objections
that
he
has,
what
more
is
he
entitled
to
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
client
still
has
his
guarantee
of
the
right
to
be
indicted
before
a
grand
jury
before
he
can
be
held
to
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whether
the
us
attorney
comes
in
with
the
evidence
all
there
before
them
and
presents
it
to
the
grand
jury
or
summons
witnesses
and
they
present
the
same
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
as
to
whether
the
grand
jury
is
going
to
indict?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
its
protection
for
the
defendant
is
not
that
it
has
the
power
to
subpoena
him,
i
would
think,
but
it
is
required
that
he
be
indicted
before
he
can
be
held
to
stand
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
not
necessarily
a
help
to
him.
