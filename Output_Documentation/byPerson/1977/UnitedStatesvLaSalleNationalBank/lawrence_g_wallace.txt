mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
internal
revenue
summons
enforcement
proceeding
in
which
the
district
court
denied
enforcement
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
case
presents
questions
that
many
of
us
thought
were
settled
by
this
court’s
decisions
in
united
states
v.
powell
in
1964
and
donaldson
v.
the
united
states
in
1971.
but,
the
questions
have
stubbornly
persisted.
the
special
agent
in
this
case
served
a
summons
on
the
respondents,
a
bank
and
its
vice-president,
seeking
information
involving
real
estate
trust
relating
to
the
affairs
of
a
particular
taxpayer
who
was
the
subject
of
his
investigation
and
incidentally,
the
record
shows
that
the
taxpayer’s
attorney
has
been
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
throughout
the
case.
the
special
agent’s
testimony,
in
response
to
the
purpose
of
the
issuance
of
the
summons
and
in
direct
response
to
questions,
said
that
the
purpose
of
his
investigation
was
to
determine
tax
liabilities
for
the
years
under
investigation
and
when
asked
what
the
focus
of
his
own
inquiry
into
the
matter
was,
he
said
it
was
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
criminal
violations
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
this
testimony
as
indicating
that
the
record
establish
that
the
special
agent
testified
to
the
existence
of
a
civil
purpose,
but
that
the
district
court
who
observed
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
discredited
that
testimony.
now,
while
it
is
not
material
to
the
position
that
we
are
taking
in
the
case,
i
do
think
it
is
illustrative
of
the
problems
we
are
running
into
in
these
cases
that
with
all
respect,
i
find
it
hard
myself
to
characterize
the
holding
of
the
district
court
this
way,
but
there
was
no
contradictory
testimony
of
any
kind.
the
district
court
was
relying
in
its
findings
solely
on
the
testimony
of
the
agent
with
respect
to
the
functions
that
he
was
carrying
out.
the
findings
recited
by
the
district
court,
seem
to
me,
to
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
agent’s
testimony
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
referring
to
the
district
court’s
opinion
at
the
bottom
of
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
and
the
top
of
page
3a,
the
district
court
said
it
is
apparent,
however,
that
this
focus
and
determination,
namely
that
it
is
an
investigation
for
a
criminal
purpose,
maybe
arrived
at
under
certain
circumstances
before
the
actual
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution
has
been
made.
in
such
event,
the
focus
and
determination
has
been
arrived
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
internal
revenue
summons.
in
the
district
court’s
view,
that
becomes
a
summons
issued
for
an
improper
purpose
that
should
not
be
enforced
and
that
was
reflected
by
the
testimony
where
the
agent
said
“while
the
purpose
of
his
investigation
was
to
determine
tax
liabilities,
the
focus
of
his
inquiry
all
consistent
with
the
language
used
by
the
district
court
was
to
investigate
whether
there
had
been
a
criminal
violation
of
the
tax
laws.”
the
difficulty
that
we
are
finding
in
the
summons
enforcement
proceedings
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
indication
that
there
was
any
rejection
of
any
of
the
witness’
testimony
on
the
basis
of
credibility
by
judge
mcgarr.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
test
being
used.
i
recognize
that
one
can
characterize
this
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
it,
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
find
inconsistency
between
judge
mcgarr’s
holding
and
the
testimony
and
he
does
not
in
any
way
reject
the
testimony,
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
so
long
as
the
agent
admits
that
the
focus
of
his
inquiry
is
on
the
criminal
aspects
of
the
investigation,
that
shows
that
there
is
a
solely
criminal
purpose
for
purposes
of
applying
the
standard
that
he
thinks
should
be
applied
under
donaldson.
this
does
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to,
if
you
will
let
me
do
it
a
little
bit
indirectly.
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
pertinent
question
and
in
the
second
place
there
is
no
such
investigation
when
an
assignment
has
been
made
to
a
special
agent.
that
is
the
short
answer,
but
i
will
have
to
explain
it
a
little
bit
indirectly.
the
difficulty
that
we
are
running
into
in
the
summons
enforcement
proceedings
in
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
that
have
departed
from
the
line
of
demarcation
that
was
at
least
one
line
clearly
established
in
donaldson
whether
a
recommendation
has
been
made
to
the
department
of
justice
and
that,
it
instead
adapted
a
standard
of
whether
the
sole
purpose
was
a
criminal
purpose
or
whether
the
agent
had
a
firm
purpose
to
recommend
prosecution
or
a
fixed
purpose
to
recommend
prosecution
is
that
the
inquiry
is
focusing
on
the
personal
purpose
of
the
agent
and
his
subjective
understanding
of
his
assignment
rather
than
the
legal
purpose
of
the
authorized
investigation
that
has
been
assigned
to
him.
an
agent
does
not
select
the
subject
of
his
investigation.
in
this
case,
he
said
he
was
assigned
to
investigate
the
tax
liabilities
of
this
particular
taxpayer.
that
assignment
was
duly
made
by
who
would
have
been
the
group
manager
in
a
large
office
such
as
this
one,
in
a
smaller
office,
it
would
be
made
by
the
chief
of
the
unit.
our
position
is
that
so
long
as
that
assignment
is
duly
made
as
a
tax
investigation
assignment
and
the
agent
is
carrying
out
that
investigation,
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
in
the
agent’s
functions
between
a
civil
and
criminal
purpose
of
his
investigation.
the
two
are
not
separable
and
the
delay
that
we
are
running
into
in
summons
enforcement
proceedings
is
because
the
agents
are
being
called
to
the
stand
and
cross
examined
about
their
personal
understanding
of
their
function
to
see
if,
in
some
way,
they
will
indicate
sometimes
through
an
appeal
to
their
vanity
about
the
kind
of
matters
that
call
for
bringing
them
into
it,
that,
this
was
really
an
investigation
of
criminal
conduct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
will
have
to
differ
with
you,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
makes
all
of
the
difference
because
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
on
the
erroneous
premise
that
the
test
here,
and
i
am
referring
back
to
judge
mcgarr’s
opinion
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
this
was
the
next
thing
i
was
getting
to,
he
said
in
the
first
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
the
court
recognizes
that
civil
and
criminal
investigations
may
go
forward
side-by-side
before
a
determination
of
the
ultimate
focus
of
the
investigation
is
made
and
that
is
quoted
virtually
word-for-word
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
8a
in
a
apparent
agreement
that
that
is
the
starting
point
of
the
legal
analysis
here,
but
it
is
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
i
am
trying
to
tell
the
court
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
civil
and
criminal
investigation
going
on
side-by-side
in
the
way
the
internal
revenue
service
proceeds.
it
really
is
a
matter
of
nomenclature
whether
you
say
that
the
special
agent’s
assignment
is
to
determine
whether
fraud
penalties
should
be
assessed
against
the
taxpayer
or
whether
there
has
been
criminal
violations
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
an
alternative
open,
but
i
think
this
is
not
a
matter
of
the
clearly
erroneous
finding.
this
is
a
matter
of
an
improper
legal
standard
being
applied
to
the
question
of
the
enforceability
of
an
internal
revenue
summons.
i
think
that
this
is
clarified,
very
helpfully,
for
us
by
a
recent
analysis
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
have
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
friendly
on
behalf
of
that
court
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
morgan
guaranty
trust.
as
he
points
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
12a
of
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
we
start
and
i
think
this
is
quite
accurate,
from
the
premise
that
investigations
of
taxpayers
that
would
develop
evidence
of
criminal,
but
not
of
civil
tax
liability
must
be
rare.
indeed,
petitioners
have
pointed
to
none.
as
we
specify
in
our
brief,
when
tax
fraud
is
found,
that
is
evidence
that
supports
a
determination
that
a
50%
fraud
penalty
should
be
added
to
the
liability
otherwise
due
and
the
internal
revenue
code
is
quite
specific
that
that
kind
of
a
fraud
penalty
is
a
tax
within
the
meaning
of
the
code,
that
is
section
6659
(a)
(2)
of
the
code
and
that
a
determination
that
a
fraud
penalty
is
owing
is
part
of
what
must
be
specified
in
the
statutory
notice
of
deficiency.
that
is
the
effect
of
section
6671
of
the
code
and
it
is
the
statutory
notice
of
deficiency
that
culminates
from
a
tax
investigation
undertaken
by
the
special
agent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
not
understanding
that
there
is
no
way
to
differentiate
the
civil
and
criminal
aspects
of
the
special
agent’s
work.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
may
not
have
sufficiently.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
that
was
granted
by
this
court
and
that
is
the
question
that
needs
deciding
because
the
courts
of
appeals
are
going
in
many
disparate
directions
here
and
many
tax
investigations
are
being
delayed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
purpose
of
my
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
the
summons
should
have
been
enforced.
that
is
exactly
what
the
second
circuit
would
have
held
on
the
basis
of
judge
mcgarr’s
findings,
which
is
why
we
are
here.
the
circuits
are
not
deciding
these
cases
the
same
way
and
we
are
having
lengthy
inquiries
of
special
agents
that
ultimately
seem
to
us
to
have
no
legal
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
revenue
agents
and
special
agents
who
specialize
in
different
aspects
of
the
investigation.
the
revenue
agent,
all
this
was
recognized
in
the
court’s
donaldson
opinion
when
it
said
that
the
mere
bringing
in
of
the
special
agent
is
not
converted
into
an
improper
use
of
the
summons.
the
revenue
agent
is
a
specialist
in
determining
liability
other
than
the
50%
addition
to
tax,
that
is
the
fraud
penalty
and
a
special
agent
is
someone
trained
to
investigate
for
fraud
and
to
see
whether
a
50%
addition
to
the
tax
liability
should
be
made.
in
other
words,
he
has
1/3
of
the
responsibility
for
determining
the
possible
deficiency
in
the
tax
payment
and
that
is
specifically
what
section
7602
of
the
code
authorizes
agents
of
the
service
to
issue
summons
for,
to
determine
tax
liability,
which
i
just
explained
to
the
court,
includes
in
the
definitions
of
the
code,
liability
for
a
fraud
penalty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
that
is
correct,
but
i
would
not
quite
characterize
it
that
way
because
there
is
no
such
thing
as
100%
criminal
in
this
sense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
cannot
assume
that
there
is
because
it
is
unrealistic.
it
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
investigation
is
assigned
to
the
agent
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is,
but
it
has
to
be
put
in
context.
the
special
agent
conducting
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i
agree
with
the
position,
but
it
has
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
two
points.
one
is
statistics
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
20
that
show
that
very
substantial
sums
of
fraud
penalties
are
assessed
as
a
result
of
these
investigations
in
cases
in
which
no
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution
is
made.
it
is
very
difficult
to
anticipate
which
of
these
investigations
will
fall
into
that
category.
the
second
point,
and
a
point
i
think
is
very
well-made,
again
in
judge
friendly’s
opinion
for
the
second
circuit,
again
on
page
12a,
is
that
it
is
not
up
to
the
special
agent
to
decide
whether
a
case
will
be
referred
for
criminal
prosecution
to
the
department
of
justice.
he
does
not
have
the
authority
to
decide.
he
is
not
the
responsible
official
to
decide
that.
we
are
cross-examining
these
special
agents
about
whether
they
have
a
firm
purpose
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
determination
that
in
all
but
form
a
recommendation
of
criminal
prosecution
will
be
transmitted
to
the
department
of
justice.
the
agent
in
determining,
after
his
investigation
is
concluded,
whether
to
recommend
prosecution
consults
with
his
group
manager
whose
recommendation
will
go
along
with
his,
either
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
it
and
i
am
told
that
in
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
cases,
the
group
manager’s
greater
experience
in
discussing
the
case
with
the
special
agent
will
change
the
special
agent’s
mind
about
whether
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
in
the
particular
case.
we
do
not
have
figures
on
that.
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
have
figures
on
that.
after
that
takes
place,
if
the
agent’s
conclusion
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
survives
that,
it
then
goes
to
the
chief
of
the
intelligence
division’s
district
office
who
has
the
authority
to
put
an
end
to
it
right
there
if
he
disagrees
with
it.
that
is
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
cases
that
get
that
far
and
then
he
puts
an
end
to
it,
but
there
are
cases
where
he
puts
an
end
to
it.
if
he
decides
to
carry
it
forward,
he
does
not
have
the
authority
to
transmit
it
to
the
department
of
justice.
his
only
authority
is
to
send
it
to
the
regional
counsel
with
a
recommendation
that
it
be
transmitted
to
the
department
of
justice
with
the
recommendation
for
criminal
prosecution.
the
regional
counsel,
we
do
have
figures
on
and
those
figures
show
that
in
fiscal
year
1976,
the
regional
counsel
declined
to
refer
14.6%
of
the
cases
that
reach
that
far
over
to
the
department
of
justice,
349
he
declined
and
2,037
he
did
refer.
in
1977,
the
percentage
was
10.9%.
now,
the
question
necessarily
arises
what
of
the
cases
in
which
the
agent
had
a
firm
purpose
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution,
but
the
evidence
that
he
had
at
that
time
that
his
purpose
became
fixed
was
not
sufficient
to
persuade
his
superiors
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
to
the
department
of
justice.
what
investigatory
tool
is
available
under
the
statutory
scheme
for
such
cases
under
the
holdings
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
say
that
the
agent’s
purpose
is
what
is
controlling
as
to
whether
the
summons
is
available?
the
summons
is
the
only
investigatory
tool
that
the
agent
has.
other
than
that,
all
he
can
do
is
present
his
credentials
and
ask
for
voluntary
disclosures
of
information
which
banks
and
other
employers
and
other
institutions
are
increasingly
reluctant
to
make
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
sued
if
they
do
not
have
compulsory
process.
there
is
no
compulsory
process
available
to
the
agent
except
the
internal
revenue
summons.
if
the
agent
has
a
firm
purpose
in
mind,
several
circuits
have
held
he
cannot
use
that
process.
that
leaves
nothing
available
but
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
had
not.
there
was,
in
that
case,
a
dictum
which
i
will
be
happy
to
refer
to
because
the
dictum
did
not
refer
to
whether
there
was
a
criminal
purpose
as
being
something
improper.
what
the
dictum
in
fact
set
on
page
449
of
volume
375
us,
the
witness
may
challenge
the
summons
at
any
appropriate
ground.
this
would
include,
as
the
circuits
have
held,
the
defense
is
that
the
material
is
sought
for
the
improper
purpose
of
obtaining
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
is
a
more
careful
formulation
of
what
is
loosely
called
for
a
criminal
purpose.
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
well
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
obtaining
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
but
the
point
is
the
special
agent
not
only
does
not
have
authority
to
determine
whether
the
recommendation
will
be
made
to
the
department
of
justice,
he
also
does
not
have
the
authority
to
determine
what
will
be
included
in
the
notice
of
tax
deficiency
that
has
to,
under
the
statute,
be
sent
to
the
taxpayer
90
days
before
the
tax
can
be
assessed
and
the
taxpayer
has
an
opportunity
to
contest
it
during
those
90
days
in
the
tax
court.
that
again,
it
is
up
to
his
superiors
to
determine
whether
that
notice
of
deficiency
should
include
a
50%
addition
to
tax
because
of
fraud
penalties.
anything
that
the
special
agent
can
find
out
in
the
course
of
his
investigation
that
indicates
criminal
violations
of
the
tax
code
of
a
fraudulent
nature
is
supporting
evidence
by
which
his
superiors
can
make
the
determination
more
accurately
whether
that
deficiency
notice
should
include
the
50%
fraud
penalty.
there
is
no
way
of
differentiating
the
special
agent’s
functions
in
getting
that
evidence
between
evidence
that
is
needed
in
order
to
carry
out
his
civil
assignment
and
evidence
that
would
show
criminal
violation
of
the
code.
the
purpose
of
the
reisman
dictum
and
its
preservation
in
donaldson,
i
think
is
quite
accurately
stated
by
the
second
circuit
and
by
judge
friendly,
is
to
assure
that
the
summons
is
not
being
used
to
trench
on
the
authority
of
the
grand
jury
or
to
broaden
the
government’s
right
to
discovery
in
criminal
proceedings.
in
other
words,
that
the
summons
is
not
being
used
after
its
civil
purposes
are
spent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
if
it
is
used
for
some
collateral
purpose.
that
is
what
the
powell
case
was
about,
what
they
called
abuse
of
process,
using
it
for
something
other
than
an
investigation
of
tax
liability
and
of
course,
that
would
be
improper,
but
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
not.
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
suggesting
that
it
might
not
be
improper
in
that
circumstance
if
the
information
so
received
is
insulated
from
the
department
of
justice
and
from
use
bu
department
in
its
prosecution,
but
we
do
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
internal
revenue
practice,
summonses
are
not
issued
once
the
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
sent.
the
summonses
are
used
to
investigate
up
to
the
point
of
determining
what
should
be
in
the
notice
of
deficiency.
now,
it
happens
that
increasingly
the
returns
of
many
of
the
summons
are
not
made
until
after
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued
because
of
all
these
proceedings
about
whether
the
summons
is
enforceable
or
not,
but
we
came
to
the
court
in
the
hope
of
restoring
the
situation,
to
getting
returns
of
the
summonses
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
notice
of
deficiency.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
i
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
basis
in
this
case
for
counsel’s
suggestion
that
the
finding
was
that
there
was
a
criminal
investigation
here
that
may
be
unrelated
to
tax
liabilities.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
says
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
special
agent
olivero
was
conducting
an
investigation
of
the
federal
tax
liabilities
of
john
gattuso
and
the
district
court
says
respondents
contend
that
special
agent
olivero
was
in
fact
conducting
an
investigation
of
criminal
violations
of
the
internal
revenue
code
by
john
gattuso.
the
miller
case,
which
has
been
referred
to,
involved
an
attempt
to
challenge
a
grand
jury
subpoena
rather
than
an
internal
revenue
summons.
it
may
be
rare,
but
it
was
an
instance
of
the
use
of
a
grand
jury
subpoena
in
a
tax
investigation.
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
the
procedural
protections
available
to
the
taxpayer
in
an
internal
revenue
summons
situation
in
many
ways
compare
favorably
to
those
available
in
the
grand
jury
subpoena
situation,
especially
with
the
enactment
of
section
7609
of
the
code
which
allows
intervention
in
the
third-party
summons
proceedings.
obviously
the
indictment,
if
there
is
to
be
one,
has
to
be
returned
by
the
grand
jury
and
evidence
developed
in
civil
investigations
as
the
court
indicated
in
united
states
v.
kordel
in
the
course
of
a
food
and
drug
administration
question
raising
the
same
issue,
evidence
developed
in
civil
investigations
legitimately
can
later
be
presented
to
a
grand
jury
and
is
pertinent
to
a
grand
jury.
the
one
suggestion
made
on
page
12a
of
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
by
judge
friendly
of
the
possibility
of
the
willfully
false
statement
having
nothing
to
do
with
liability
is
not
something
that
ordinarily
could
be
anticipated
at
the
time
the
special
agent
commences
his
investigation.
ordinarily,
the
willfully
false
statement
that
a
tax
investigation
would
be
concerned
with
is
concealment
of
the
source
of
income
which
is
a
common
way
of
concealing
deficiencies
and
whether
a
prosecution
should
later
be
brought
even
though
it
turns
out
that
no
additional
liability
is
involved,
it
is
not
something
that
can
be
determined
at
the
outset
in
deciding
whether
to
follow
up
an
investigation
to
see
whether
the
source
of
income
has
been
concealed.
it
cannot
be
known
at
that
point
whether
that
will
indicate
in
the
particular
case
that
there
is
additional
tax
liability.
finally,
i
wanted
to
say
that
what
we
are
faced
with
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
cases
that
suggest
the
most
serious
problems
of
fraud
where
the
special
agent
may
think
this
is
likely
to
be
a
case,
where
a
criminal
recommendation
will
eventuate,
are
the
cases
where
there
are
difficulties
in
getting
the
summonses
enforced
in
pursuing
the
investigations.
whereas,
the
more
marginal
cases
that
the
special
agents
are
involved
in
where
they
may
not
have
much
of
a
notion
at
the
beginning
that
this
is
likely
to
show
a
serious
fraud
are
the
ones
where
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
they
have
a
firm
purpose
that
they
are
going
to
recommend
a
criminal
prosecution.
we
are
finding
that
the
sole
investigatory
tool
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
being
denied
early
on
in
the
investigations
in
the
more
serious
cases
leaving
us
with
only
the
alternative
of
presenting
unright
investigatory
files
to
the
us
attorneys
and
to
clutter
up
grand
jury
proceedings
where
many
of
them
would
be
weeded
out
in
the
normal
course
of
the
internal
revenue
investigations
after
the
evidence
is
developed
and
reviewed
by
superiors
is
made.
