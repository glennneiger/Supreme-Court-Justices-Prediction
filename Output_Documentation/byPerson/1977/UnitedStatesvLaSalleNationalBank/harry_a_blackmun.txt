harry

the
second
case
united
states
against
the
lasalle
national
bank
comes
to
us
by
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
and
it
relates
to
the
issuance
of
internal
revenue
service
summonses.
a
special
agent
in
the
process
of
investigating
a
tax
payer's
tax
liability
issued
summonses
to
the
lasalle
national
bank
of
chicago
under
section
7602
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
specifically
the
summonses
ask
the
bank
to
appear
before
the
agent
and
to
produce
files
of
certain
land
trust
that
the
bank
held
for
the
tax
payer.
the
bank
official
appeared
but
he
refused
to
produce
the
files,
the
united
states
in
the
agent
and
then
petitioned
the
district
court
for
enforcement
of
those
summonses.
the
court
denied
enforcement,
and
it
specifically
found
that
the
summonses
were
not
issued
in
good
faith
because
they
were
issued
by
the
agent
solely
for
the
purpose
of
unearthing
evidence
of
criminal
conduct
by
the
taxpayer,
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
a
day
we
hold
that
the
court's
below
erred
in
refusing
to
enforce
the
summonses.
congress
has
not
categorized
tax
fraud
investigation
into
civil
and
criminal
components
instead
it
has
created
a
tax
enforcement
system
in
which
criminal
and
civil
elements
are
inherently
intertwined.
to
enforce
a
summons
under
7602,
it
definitely
of
course
must
be
issued
before
the
service
recommends
to
the
department
of
justice
that
a
criminal
prosecution
relating
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
summons
be
undertaken.
prior
to
that
recommendation
however,
the
service
may
use
its
summons
authority
in
good
faith
and
not
abandoned
its
institutional
responsibility
to
collect
civil
fraud
penalties
and
fraudulently
reported
or
unreported
taxes.
since
there
was
no
recommendation
as
yet
to
the
justice
department
for
criminal
prosecution
when
these
summonses
were
issued
and
absent
any
showing
that
the
special
agent
already
possessed
all
the
evidence
sought
without
the
service
in
an
institutional
sense
had
abandoned
pursuit
of
the
taxpayer's
civil
tax
liability.
the
respondents
have
not
shown
sufficient
justification
to
preclude
enforcement
of
the
summonses
in
question.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
accordingly
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
i
believe
concurs
at
least
in
the
judgment
of
reversal
but
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
