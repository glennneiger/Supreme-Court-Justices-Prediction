unknown
speaker
mr.
siegel,
does
the
record
show
whether
sears
was
a
member
of
the
building
trades
council?
unknown
speaker
or
has
it
signed
the
master
agreement?
unknown
speaker
is
it
fairly
common
in
the
california
superior
court,
injunctive
procedures
for
a
temporary
injunction
to
be
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
written
record
with
the
consideration
affidavits?
unknown
speaker
what
if
30
days
have
gone
by
before
sears
moved?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
pursue
to
my
question.
let
us
suppose
that
there
were
picketing
for
organizational
purposes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
what
if
it
would
have
gone
to
state
court?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
want
to
get
to
--
why?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
nothing
had
started,
sears
just
did
not
get
around
to
doing
anything
until
after
30
days
and
then
it
decided
that
it
was
tired
of
this
recognition
picketing
and
went
to
state
court
for
an
injunction,
claiming
that
they
were
trespassing
and
the
union
answered,
well
this
is
arguably
prohibited
by
--
if
these
have
not
--
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
say,
you
are
just
urging
us
then
to
go
even
that
far
and
saying
that
even
if
it
is
arguably
prohibited
or
is
prohibited
on
anybody's
prediction
that
the
state
court
should
be
free
to
go
ahead
or
even
though
the
general
council
in
that
circumstance
can
go
right
to
court
and
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
siegel,
help
me
out
a
little
bit
--
sears
asked
the
pickets
to
leave
premises.
at
that
time
was
the
union
in
a
position
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
claim
under
8
(a)
(1)?
unknown
speaker
but,
would
sears
then
be
satisfied
if
we
had
a
rule,
let
me
put
in
another
way,
if
sears
feel
adequately
protected.
if
we
held
that
the
union
could
not
claim
pre-emption
unless
it
had
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
claim.
unknown
speaker
would
you
believe
it
is
fine
with
it?
unknown
speaker
unless
it
wanted
to
exercise
self-help?
unknown
speaker
why
did
sears
not
protect
itself
that
way?
just
the
threat
of
violence?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
the
union
were
arguing
that
just
an
order
to
get
off
was
not
an
adequate
premise
for
filing
a
charge
that
when
you
went
to
court,
would
add
something
substantial
for
that
action,
i
suppose?
at
least
then
the
union's
right
to
file
if
it
had
one,
should
mature?
unknown
speaker
it
used
to
be
that
the
board
had
no
declaratory
judgment
procedure
and
like
some
agencies
does
it
have
any
now?
unknown
speaker
but,
my
question
is
does
it
have
any?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
siegel,
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
did
the
the
union
represent
any
sears
employees?
unknown
speaker
this
point
urged
upon
the
superior
court
judge
in
san
diego
county
in
the
hearing
before
the
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
were
these
decisions
of
supreme
court
of
california
called
those
attentions?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
followed
the
decision
of
supreme
court
of
california
that
you
contend
is
right
in
the
forum?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
to
review
that
sort
of
a
point
here.
what
the
california
law
was
on
the
subject?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
it
falls
a
little
bit
under
the
mold
of
the
human
cannonball
case
that
my
brother
white
wrote
for
us
last
term,
that
is
that
--
where
it
appears
that
the
state
court
may
feel
itself
bound
to
reach
a
particular
conclusion
as
a
result
of
a
principle
of
federal
law.
this
court
will
decide
the
principle
of
federal
law
and
send
it
back
so
that
the
state
court
will
--
if
federal
law
does
not
preclude
the
state
court
from
reaching
its
own
result
and
its
own
law
but
state
court
is
then
free
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
why
did
not
the
supreme
court
of
california
reverse
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
they
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
of
those
grounds
would
remain
open
for
the
california
court's
decision
if
we
were
to
reverse
on
a
federal
ground
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
will
vary
from
state
to
state
depending
on
how
deeply
rooted
the
trespass
feeling
appears
from
an
examination
of
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
deeply
rooted
state
feeling
got
to
do
with
it
at
all
that
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
then
your
response
to
petitioner
would
be,
even
if
he
is
right,
it
would
go
on
a
state
to
state
basis?
unknown
speaker
but
only
if
the
union
filed.
unknown
speaker
that
is
after
30
days?
unknown
speaker
if
in
your
view,
and
belief
at
that
time
there
was
no
basis
for
going
to
the
board
when
you
were
ordered
off
the
premises,
did
you
have
a
basis
for
going
to
the
board
when
the
sears
went
to
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
you
answered
my
brother
white
that
only
if
the
union
had
filed
--
had
gone
to
the
board,
at
page
17
of
its
amicus
brief,
board
says
the
union's
activity
here
was
arguably
prohibited,
sears
could
have
filed
the
charge.
unknown
speaker
you
had
answered
my
brother
white,
only
if
the
union
filed
a
charge.
the
board's
position
is
that
sears
could
have
filed
a
charge?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
what
would
have
been
the
basis
for
an
employer
to
file
a
charge
prior
to
the
end
of
30
days?
unknown
speaker
but,
would
have
had
to
do
very
little
with
where
they
are
picketing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams
could
you
help
me
on
the
theory
of
the
union's
8
(a)
(1)
charge
which
someone
suggested
had
been
filed.
if
the
union
did
not
represent
any
employees,
how
could
they
file
an
8
(a)
(1)
charge?
unknown
speaker
is
that
settled
i
am
just
--
i
have
to
confess
my
agreements
on
it
--
because
the
statutory
language
speaks
of
employees
and
i
did
not
realize
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
the
trial
court
did
not
agree
with
you
on
california
law
?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
the
answer
is
they
did
not
agree
with
you.
did
you
ever
present
a
claim
under
california
law
court?
unknown
speaker
or
did
the
union
say
that
it
was
contrary
to
california
law
to
reach
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
did
it
present
that
claim
to
the
district
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
to
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
and
neither
court
reached
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
district
court
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
so
it
disagreed
with
the
union
also
on
the
california
law?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say,
you
are
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
hold
that
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
it
did
not
say
whether
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
distinguishing
the
priorities?
unknown
speaker
well
they
did
not
say
that
the
district
court
was
wrong.
did
they?
unknown
speaker
but
never
did
say
the
district
court
was
wrong
on
the
california
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
you
started
out
by
pointed
out
that
either
the
record
was
unclear
there
was
no
finding
as
to
whether
the
picketing
had
any
effect
on
interrupting
deliveries?
what
difference
does
that
make,
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
the
picketing
is
for
some
reason
either
interfere
with
the
patronage
of
the
store,
ought
to
interfere
with
delivery?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
what
point
you
were
making
that
is
why
i
did
not
write
that.
unknown
speaker
but
did
we
not
assume
for
the
purpose
of
decision
that
he
did,
would
that
not
be
better?
unknown
speaker
may
i
continue?
unknown
speaker
say
that
again
whether
you
on
the
top
of
page
9?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
see
the
sentence
to
which
you
are
referring.
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
did
the
union
present
the
state
law
questions
to
the
state
supreme
court
?
unknown
speaker
but
the
one
the
court
of
appeal
decided.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
statute
seems
to
prevent
injunctions
where
the
union
is
entitled
to
be
where
it
is
--
