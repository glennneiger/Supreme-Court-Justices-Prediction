justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
labor
case
in
which
the
question
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
act
deprives
a
state
court
of
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
picketing
that
is
conducted
in
violation
of
state
trespass
laws
and
that
is
arguably
either
prohibited
or
protected
by
the
federal
statute.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
california.
a
california
trial
judge
entered
an
injunction
requiring
that
a
union
discontinue
its
picketing
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
sears,
roebuck
department
store.
the
picketing
had
been
commenced
when
the
union
learned
that
certain
carpentry
work
was
being
performed
at
the
store
by
men
who
had
not
been
dispatched
from
the
union
hiring
hall.
and
when
sears
did
not
agree
to
use
only
union
carpenters.
the
california
supreme
court
had
reversed
the
trial
judge
on
the
ground
that
the
picketing
was
at
least
arguably
protected
by
federal
law
or
in
the
alternative.
arguably
constituted
the
violation
of
the
federal
statute
and
therefore
only
the
national
labor
relations
board,
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
its
legality.
for
reasons
stated
in
detail
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
we
reversed
the
california
supreme
court.
we
hold
that
the
fact
of
the
objective
of
the
picketing
is
arguably
proscribed
by
federal
law
does
not
deprive
the
state
court
of
jurisdiction
to
consider
whether
the
picketing
maybe
conducted
on
sears's
property
rather
than
public
property.
we
also
hold
that
at
least
when
the
union
has
fail
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
when
permitting
the
state
court
to
entertain
a
trespass
cause
of
action
does
not
create
a
significant
risk
of
interference
with
protected
conduct.
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
make
the
preliminary
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
picketing
is
in
fact
protected
by
federal
law.
for
in
these
circumstances
the
state
court
is
the
only
tribunal
in
which
the
issue
maybe
decided.
we
therefore
reverse
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
have
each
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
