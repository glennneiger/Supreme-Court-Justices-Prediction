mr.
jerry
j.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
start,
if
i
may,
by
responding
to
some
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
council
for
the
petitioner
with
which
we
are
in
dispute.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
for
example,
to
show
that
the
superior
court
believed
that
the
sears
affidavits
were
correct
and
that
the
union
affidavits
were
incorrect,
that
kind
of
determination
was
not
made.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
unaware
until
after
the
ruling
had
been
made
that
any
affidavits
have
been
filed
to
effect
that
anyone
had
interrupted
deliveries
assuming
that
that
was
a
union
objective
in
the
course
of
the
picketing
at
the
relocated
areas.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
well,
there
is
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
issued,
as
i
recollect
ex
parte
whereas
we
remember
the
forum
going
down
on
the
matter
because
it
seemed
so
simplistic
nature.
then
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
after
hearing,
then
there
was
demur
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
and
we
had
two
different
superior
court
judges
involved
in
those
proceedings
which
were
unduly
progressed
and
rather
prolonged.
the
union
sue
sponte
discontinued
the
picketing
as
being
totally
un-factual,
after
the
court
had
ordered
that
the
pickets
to
be
relocated
to
the
outlying
areas.
i
think
the
briefs
in
the
appendix
show
that
there
is
a
great
distance
from
the
sidewalks
around
sears
store
to
the
actual
so
called
public
sidewalk,
if
that
is
an
appropriate
term
in
this
context.
so
that
the
cars
where
they
were
shooting
in
out
from
the
public
street
to
the
public
areas
which
were
in
all
respects
identical
to
any
other
area
of
chula
vista
which
was
in
fact
public.
some
of
them
perhaps
just
going
to
the
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox
in
the
so
called
private
area
of
the
sears
sidewalk
which
was
the
sidewalk
around
the
store.
i
had
no
idea
that
there
have
been
any
interruption
under
those
reasons,
so
i
read
the
affidavits
after
the
order
had
been
issued.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no.
i
think
your
honor
what
the
judge
believed
and
i
think,
he
was
demonstrably
incorrect
in
this
regard
as
evidenced
by
the
finding
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
also
case
has
later
cited,
that
section
552.1
of
the
california
penal
code
required
that
the
issue
at
injunction
on
the
theory
that
the
union
was
trespassing
on
property
other
than
posted
industrial
property.
the
california
supreme
court
decisions
been
raised
in
schwartz-torrance
investment
corporation
versus
bakery's
union
dealing
with
shopping
center
type
situations
and
also
providing
an
interpret
of
judicial
loss
to
552.1
make
clear
that
those
exceptions
on
behalf
of
labor
organizations
apply
not
only
to
posted
industrial
property
but
fortiori,
as
the
court
has
itself
a
reason,
i
am
speaking
of
the
california
supreme
court.
as
the
court
has
itself
a
reason
if
it
applies
an
exception
in
favor
of
labor
organization
picketing
to
the
general
trespass
statute,
section
602
of
the
california
penal
code
to
posted
industrial
property,
a
fortiori
that
exception
applies
to
property
other
than
posted
industrial
property.
that
was
the
mistake
that
the
court
made
as
i
said
the
case
started
out
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
end
result
of
the
case
was
i
have
no
independent
recollection
as
to
whether
schwartz-torrance
case
was,
it
is
my
recollection
however
my
best
guess
that
it
was
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no
your
honor
i
wish
that
had
been
the
case.
it
would
not
be
here
now.
what
happened
as
the
appendix,
i
think
clearly
indicates
in
those
portions
of
the
transcript
which
were
cited
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
the
superior
court
judge
said
in
effect,
well
i
really
hate
to
issue
this
injunction.
it
seems
wrong
to
me
but
this
is
not
posted
industrial
property
and
under
552.1
the
exemption
for
labor
organization
trespass
picketing
apparently
applies
only
to
posted
industrial
property.
he
was
clearly
wrong
in
that.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
well,
the
question
was
asked,
i
was
responding
to
a
question
from
the
chief
justice.
yes,
i
think
we
quite
clearly
had
raised
the
question
of
an
independent
state
ground
as
a
basis
of
this
decision.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
well,
i
think
perhaps,
if
this
is
response
your
honor.
the
short
answer
is
the
trial
judge
made
a
mistake
and
the
record
clearly
shows
that,
the
appendix
which
is
before
this
court
clearly
shows
that.
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
quite
clearly
in
schwartz-torrance
investment
corporation
places
an
interpretive
loss
on
552.1.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
have
asked
myself
that
question.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no.
they
did
not.
they
seemed
determined
to
raise
this
specific
question
whether
or
not
the
garmon
doctrine
as
recently
restated
in
the
farmer
&
hill
case,
the
hill
case
which
became
a
farmer
case
and
now
perhaps
the
farmer
and
hill
case.
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
federal
pre-emption
or
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
applied
to
trespassory
picketing,
a
question
specifically
reserved
in
the
fairline
contrary
against
the
assertion
of
counsel
that
has
uniformly
conceded
that
this
is
interest
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling.
certainly
is
not
an
interest
deeply
routed
in
local
feeling
of
california
which
has
both,
a
line
of
cases
saying
that
labor
unions
may
trespass
so
to
use
that
word
advisedly
on
private
property
and
also
as
most
recently
enacted
a
statute
after
the
submission
of
briefs
to
the
california
supreme
court,
527.3
of
the
california
court
of
civil
procedure
to
further
illuminate
the
judicial
gloss
placed
on
552.1
to
it.
the
labor
organizations
may
trespass
for
labor
organizational
purposes
and
no
preliminary
injunctions
may
be
issued
to
stop
them.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
am
not
sure
i
can
answer
that
in
the
manner
which
it
is
posed
your
honor
for
this
reason.
as
i
understand
that
one
of
the
questions
which
is
raised
by
petitioners
whether
or
not
trespassory
picketing
is
in
fact
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling.
california
says
it
is
not.
the
issue
was
reserved
in
fairline.
we
are
talking
here
about
arguably
protected
activity
under
section
7
of
the
amended
labor
management
relations
act.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
on
the
contrary
your
honor,
i
am
suggesting
that
in
a
line
of
the
decisions
starting
with
garmon
2
at
least
in
1959
reiterated
most
recently
in
the
farmer
hill
case
if
i
may
use
that
terminology.
last
term
the
court
has
been
unanimous
on
the
point
that
what
we
are
talking
about
arguably
protected
activities,
here
peaceful
picketing,
concededly
peaceful
picketing
that
the
activity
is
pre-empted
and
that
the
nlrb's
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
or
as
the
court
has
itself
said
the
nlrb
may
not
have
the
last
but
they
must
have
the
first.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
point
had
been
made
by
petitioner
your
honor
that
everybody
knows
or
everybody
conceives
which
i
pick
issue
with
that
this
is
an
area
deeply
rooted
in
state
feeling
and
that
area
is
deeply
rooted
in
state
feeling
are
exemptions
to
the
garmon
doctrine
of
federal
preemption.
everybody
does
not
know
that,
i
do
not
know
that.
the
state
of
california
does
not
know
that.
that
is
a
point
that
i
was
making.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no
your
honor.
i
am
saying
this,
i
am
saying
that
from
garmon
2
to
farmer
hill,
even
though
in
garmon
2,
there
were
justice
harland
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
on
the
point
of
arguably
protected
activity
in
contradistinction
to
arguably
prohibited
activity.
the
court
was
unanimous
in
holding
that
as
to
arguably
protected
activity
under
section
7
and
in
this
case
section
13,
the
board's
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
and
state
court's
must
deal.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
frankly
your
honor
i
did
not
know
that
in
1973.
i
have
discovered
it
from
reading
the
board's
amicus
brief,
that
that
is
the
board's
position
from
the
moment
that
the
employer
orders
the
union
off
premises
that
gives
rise
to
an
arguable
8
(a)
1
thereby
providing
a
forum
for
the
employer
which
has
been
apparently
a
concern
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
providing
a
forum
for
the
employer
to
determine
whether
the
picketing
was
trespassory
in
nature
or
whether
it
was
protected
under
section
7
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes,
your
honor
if
the
8
(a)
(1)
were
filed.
however,
i
might
add
in
response
to
question
asked
earlier
by
your
honor
that
with
regard
to
the
30-day
rule
had
that
occurred
of
course
that
would
give
immediate
rise
to
8(b)(7)
petition
and
a
consequent
10
(l)
injunction
under
the
board's
jurisdiction
to
apply
in
federal
court
for
a
subject
10
(l)
injunction
and
those
injunctions
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes,
your
honor
that
was
the
question
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
when
sears
obtained
the
injunction
your
honor?
i
would
suppose,
as
i
now
understand
the
board's
position
that
in
8(a)(1)
injunction
--
an
8(a)(1)
unfair
labor
practice
charge
will
be
entertained
by
the
region
on
the
basis
of
any
action
to
interfere
with
the
section
7
rights
of
the
picketers.
that
we
did
not
understand
at
the
time
of
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
say
because
it
was
very
simple
matter
since
the
state
law
was
so
clear.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes
your
honor.
i
recall
that
portion
in
the
brief,
sears
did
not
file
a
charge.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes
your
honor,
the
board's
position
is
we
were
both
remiss
in
not
filing
charges.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
board
suggested
that
a
charge
could
be
filed
under
8
(b)
(2)
and
that
we
are
trying
to
coerce
the
employer
and
to
discharging
employees
in
favor
of
union
adherence.
the
board
suggested
several
other
basis
on
which
section
8
(b)
unfair
labor
practice
charges
could
have
been
filed,
outlined
i
believe
at
page
17
of
that
petition.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
with
the
location
of
the
picketing
your
honor,
it
might
depending
on
what
charge
was
filed
and
what
action
the
board
sought
to
take.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
on
the
theory
that
the
section
7
rights
of
the
union
adherence,
the
picketers
were
being
invaded.
as
i
understand
it,
everyone
has
section
7
rights
of
employees
and
non-employee
organizers,
parking
back
to
babcock
&
wilcox,
also
republic
aviation
and
alternative
line
of
cases.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
as
i
say,
the
board
takes
the
position
of
both
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
were
equally
remiss
in
not
filing
charges
under
those
circumstances.
of
course,
it
has
never
part
of
the
garmon
doctrine
or
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption
under
the
supremacy
clause
that
the
filing
of
a
charge
was
a
condition
perceiving
to
the
exercise
of
arguably
protected
a
contradistinction
to
arguably
prohibited
activities.
also
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
since
we
were
dealing
with
arguably
protected
activities
which
were
nullified
by
the
effect
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
it
was
seemed
clear
that
this
was
a
matter
which
fell
within
the
line
of
cases
originating
with
garmon
1
in
1953,
i
believe
and
recently
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
farmer
hill
decision.
another
point
that
has
been
made
or
urged
is
that
after
all
its
much
more
expeditious
for
an
attorney
representing
an
employer
to
go
to
superior
court
and
get
an
injunction.
well,
that
is
true,
it
certainly
is
but
the
vice
of
that
is
that
the
injunction
is
almost
invariably
dispositive,
the
terms
temporary
injunction
or
preliminary
injunction
are
misnomers.
that
of
course
was
a
point
made
years
ago
by
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
greenan
(ph).
the
labor
injunction
which
led
to
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
we
had
no
similar
such
statute
in
california
until
the
recent
passage
of
the
statute
adverted
to
in
our
brief
ccp
section
527.3,
pointing
out
that
the
so
called
preliminary
injunction
is
anything
but
preliminary
or
was
said
to
me
when
i
was
going
to
law
school
there
is
nothing
more
permanent
than
a
temporary
building.
if
i
may
then
de
into
resume
the
order
of
my
argument,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
are
arguably
protected
activities,
the
activities
is
beyond
dispute
and
i
think
conceded
by
council.
we
are
talking
about
peaceful
picketing
on
walkways
generally
open
to
the
public.
there
was
a
us
mailbox,
big
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox
in
the
area
denominated
by
the
petitioner
as
private.
there
was
no
obstruction
of
traffic
whatsoever
at
anytime.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
term
private
property
--
it
raises
a
tautology
when
we
are
talking
about
section
7
rights.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox,
us
mailbox?
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
there
may
be
a
mail
slot
your
honor,
one
of
those
brass
things
with
a
slot
in
it.
yes,
in
a
hotel.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
big
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox
mounted
anchored
to
the
curb
of
a
sidewalk
is
an
invitation
to
all
comers
to
come
on
the
premises
and
to
say
under
those
circumstances
that
the
property
is
private
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
well,
may
be
some
of
the
pickets
wish
to
do
so.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox
is
part
of
the
appendix
picture
d.
it
came
out
very
poorly
in
the
polaroid,
i
wish
i
could
do
something
about
that.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
was
a
red,
white
and
blue
mailbox
anchored
to
the
sidewalk
denominated
by
the
petitioner
as
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
it
would
not
have
been
a
mailbox
then
your
honor
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
--
well
if
it
were
green
then
we
would
be
back
to
prior
to
garmon
i
think
we
would
be
in
serious
trouble.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
just
this
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
tautology
to
talk
about
section
7
rights
versus
private
property
rights
because
it
is
a
true
as
a
jury's
prudence
then
in
a
true
sense
when
we
are
talk
about
private
property,
we
are
talking
about
the
right
to
exclude
others.
what
we
are
talking
here
is
under
what
circumstances
do
individuals
be
the
union
adherence,
employees
of
the
employer
or
otherwise
have
the
right
of
access
and
to
use,
i
know
that
the
term
private
property
is
sacrosanct
in
english
common
law
and
it
has
been
carried
over
to
united
states
but
no
matter
how
metaphysically
we
treat
it,
property
has
no
rights.
so
we
are
talking
here
about
rights
of
access
of
individuals
be
the
union
adherence
or
otherwise
in
a
situation
of
peaceful
picketing
which
is
arguably
protected,
admittedly
peaceful
picketing
under
section
7
and
13
of
the
act.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
think
the
trial
court
was
confused
and
i
think
the
record
indicates
that.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
did
not
personally.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
state
of
california
decided
the
case
of
course
on
the
basis
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
district
court
of
appeal
distinguished
the
schwartz-torrance
and
the
other
cases.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
say
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
correct
in
holding
that
under
state
law
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
allowing
the
so
called
trespassory
picketing.
they
did
not
choose
that
basis
of
decision.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no
they
have
held
it
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no,
it
did
an
interesting
thing,
the
first
time
they
assumed
jurisdiction
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
in
effect
they
did.
they
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
view
the
case
in
light
of
musicians
local
6
versus
oakland
stadium
in
which
those
kinds
of
issues
were
raised.
the
district
court
of
appeals
made
a
second
decision
in
which
they
chose
not
to
follow
that
direction
and
that
second
time
the
california
supreme
court
asserted
jurisdiction,
they
decided
it
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
preemption
issue.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
no
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
oh,
surely
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
the
point,
i
was
contesting
the
observation
of
the
petitioner
that
the
court
believed
the
employer
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes.
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
i
think
also
there
has
been
an
equation
made
between
trespass
and
other
kinds
of
tortuous
activity
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
exceptions
to
the
garmon
doctrine
now
and
each
one
of
those
cases
such
as
linn
versus
plant
guards
dealing
with
malicious
libel
or
the
farmer
hill
case
dealing
with
outrageous
infliction
of
emotional
distress
or
even
youngdahl
versus
rainfair
dealing
with
violent
picketing.
we've
dealt
with
outrageous,
particularly
outrageous
conduct.
you
might
even
say
unconscionable
conduct
and
even
there
the
court
has
been
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
unconscionable
conduct
and
the
conduct
which
is
protected
as
in
youngdahl
for
example,
which
says
that
the
violence
is
certainly
subject
to
the
police
power
of
the
state
but
not
the
right
to
picket
it.
so
in
sum,
on
that
aspect
of
our
case
your
honor
contrary
to
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
garmon
is
not
displaced
by
the
mere
incantation
of
the
phrase
violence,
liable,
tortuous
infliction
of
emotional
distress
or
trespass.
in
other
words,
there
is
another
such
equation
that
has
been
made
and
that
particular
blunderbuss
approach
has
been
studiously
avoided
by
this
court
in
a
line
of
decisions
as
recently
as
the
farmer
case.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
your
honor
that
with
regard
to
the
reply
brief,
i
had
hope
that
the
court
would
regard
it
is
untimely
since
it
apparently
does
not
comply
with
the
time
requirements
of
rule
41
that
--
since
that
apparently
has
not
occurred
that
hastily
reviewed
that
brief
and
i
find
that
there
is
at
page
9,
the
misstatement
of
the
law.
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
arguably
protected
has
been
the
pre-emption
rule
not
actually
protected.
also
the
two
cases
cited
--
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes
your
honor
mr.
jerry
j.
williams
yes
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
in
effect
that
even
though
conduct
is
arguably
protected
it
may
nevertheless
not
be
preempted
absent
the
determination
that
it
has
actually
protected.
well,
that
with
all
due
respect
your
honor
for
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
ariadne
case,
such
has
not
been
the
garmon
doctrine
rule.
the
two
cases
which
were
cited
are
in
opposite
at
page
11,
one
deals
with
the
public
employees
strike,
the
other
deals
with
violence
and
mass
picketing,
neither
deal
with
the
interpretation
of
527.3
appropriate
here.
that
your
honor
concludes
my
presentation.
thank
you.
