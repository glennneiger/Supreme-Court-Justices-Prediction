mr.
h.
warren
siegel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
they
arise
out
of
the
sears
chula
vista
store
which
is
located
somewhat
south
of
san
diego.
the
store
is
a
free
standing
store,
not
a
part
of
the
shopping
center,
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
parking
lot
and
public
streets
and
side
walks
on
the
fourth
side
by
block
wall
separating
the
commercial
property
from
private
residences.
in
october
of
1973,
representatives
of
the
carpenters
union
appeared
at
the
store
and
demanded
of
the
store
manager
mr.
ochoa
(ph)
that
sears
remove
its
employees
from
doing
work
which
the
union
considered
to
be
within
the
carpenter's
jurisdiction
and
either
obtain
carpenters
from
a
licensed
contractor
who
would
obtain
those
carpenters
from
union
hiring
hall
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
store
manager
should
sign
what
was
called
a
short
form
contract
with
the
union.
mr
ochoa
indicated
that
he
would
get
back
to
the
union,
apparently
for
some
reason
he
did
not.
the
union
then
placed
pickets
on
the
private
property
of
sears,
roebuck
&
co.
signs
indicating
simply
that
they
were
sanctioned
by
the
ffl-cio
and
that
they
were
from
the
carpenters
union.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
the
record
does
not
show
that
your
honor.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
no.
sears
is
however
--
is
not
but
i
do
not
believe
that
is
in
the
record.
if
it
had
been
so
the
union,
i
think
would
have
had
other
alternatives
such
as
arbitration
provisions
and
so
on,
sears
would
have
had
also.
in
any
case,
the
pickets
were
requested
to
leave.
they
refused
to
do
so.
they
did
leave
after
a
while
for
a
very
short
time,
apparently
some
phone
calls
were
made
and
they
then
re-appeared
on
the
property
and
indicated
they
would
not
leave
unless
compelled
to
do
so
by
legal
process.
sears
did
not
challenge
the
objective
of
the
picketing.
it
decides
themselves
we
are
not
precise
as
to
what
the
objective
were
but
the
conversations
had
before
hand
indicated
several
alternative
objectives.
sears
did
protest
the
location
of
the
picketing.
sears
then
apply
to
the
san
diego
county
superior
court
for
temporary
restraining
order
which
in
california
is
a
notice
type
hearing.
the
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
subsequently
held
a
hearing
which
was
on
written
record
in
california
affidavits
and
in
november
1973
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
the
sole
effect
of
which
was
to
confine
the
picketing
to
the
public
streets
and
side
walks
surrounding
the
store
and
not
the
private
property.
in
doing
so
the
superior
court
considered
not
only
issues
that
arose
under
california
state
law
such
as
whether
this
was
commercial
property
or
industrial
property.
it
considered
also
the
necessity
for
maintaining
the
peace,
the
potential
for
violence
in
a
trespass
type
situation.
it
applied
a
balancing
standard,
not
unlike
the
babcock
&
wilcox
standard
of
this
court.
after
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued,
the
unions
did
picket
on
the
public
sidewalks
surrounding
the
store.
at
this
point,
we
come
to
perhaps
the
only
issue
that
was
really
in
dispute
in
the
record
before
superior
court.
sears
had
affidavits
which
indicated
that
there
had
been
effective
picketing,
people
did
decline
to
enter
sears
property
including
some
who
were
making
commercial
deliveries
to
the
store.
the
union
said
that
the
picketing
on
the
public
sidewalks
was
not
effective,
pointed
to
no
specific
instance
of
its
lack
of
effect.
the
superior
court
weighing
that
conflicting
affidavits
believe
that
sears
testimony
which
had
pointed
to
several
specific
instances
of
effectiveness
and
did
issue
the
preliminary
injunction.
at
no
time,
during
the
entire
process
of
this
proceeding
which
began
in
october
finally
resulting
in
the
preliminary
injunction
on
november
21st,
1973
or
any
time
thereafter,
as
the
union
filed
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
yes.
your
honor.
it
would
be
unusual.
the
court
has
discretion
to
take
oral
testimony
but
it
is
highly
unusual
to
do
so.
the
issue
therefore
in
this
case
has
basically
one
of
the
procedure
by
which
the
rights
of
private
parties
have
to
be
resolved
in
a
peaceful
picketing
situation.
while
this
arises
in
a
picketing
context,
the
same
problems
would
of
course,
be
existing
and
whether
its
hand
building
or
organizational
activity
such
as
central
hardware
solicitation
activities.
the
same
basic
problem
arises
in
any
kind
of
activity
occurring
on
private
property.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
the
state
court
should
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
resolve
these
kinds
of
issues.
in
many
respects
the
type
of
resolution
that
occurred
in
this
case
on
a
motion
for
an
injunction
is
not
unlike
the
situation
where
these
issues
are
presented
to
a
state
court,
for
example,
if
an
arrest
have
been
effected.
if
sears
had
called
the
sheriff
and
had
the
pickets
arrested
for
trespass
or
for
some
other
act,
the
state
court
would
ultimately
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
an
issue
that
it
would
have
jurisdiction
to
do
so,
resolve
the
criminal
case
and
in
so
doing
would
have
to
consider
not
only
the
elements
of
state
law
that
were
involved
in
the
particular
crime
but
would
also
become
involved
in
--
but
undoubtedly
be
a
defense
and
that
is
that
the
activity
on
the
property
was
not
some
way
privileged
or
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
same
thing
would
be
true
for
example,
if
in
the
process
of
ejecting
a
union
representative
from
the
property,
there
was
a
lawsuit
against
the
ejector
for
assault
of
battery.
again
the
state
court
would
be
called
upon
not
only
to
resolve
the
state
elements
of
those
torts
but
undoubtedly
have
to
resolve
the
factual
issues
that
would
be
raised
in
defense
that
the
activity
of
the
person
being
ejected
was
not
some
way
protected.
viewed
in
that
context,
the
type
of
issues
that
the
state
court
would
resolve
on
an
injunction
motion
are
no
different
than
those
issues
which
very
clearly
and
as
to
which
there
is
no
argument,
the
state
court
already
has
jurisdiction,
even
though
the
matter
may
have
originated
out
of
a
labor
dispute
at
some
time.
under
garmon,
if
we
view
this
in
the
context
the
backdrop
of
state
law,
these
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that
state
courts
have
been
resolving,
since
before
there
were
states
in
effect,
going
back
to
the
very
earliest
common
law
actions
involving
trespass.
the
advantage
of
allowing
the
state
court
to
resolve
this
type
of
dispute
is
of
course
that
it
channels
the
dispute
into
a
neutral
form
avoiding
the
necessity
of
self
help.
the
court
would
be
very
concerned
that
should
self-help
be
exercised
that
that
could
very
quickly
lead
to
an
active
violence.
there
is
no
issue
under
the
current
state
of
the
law
that
the
ejector
could
use
(inaudible).
that
has
been
suggested
by
many
of
the
commentators,
and
it
has
been
mentioned
in
decisions
of
this
court.
if
in
fact
one
could
use
self-help
to
affect
the
removal
of
pickets
from
the
premises
and
thereby
channel
the
dispute
at
least
as
to
the
criminal
aspects
or
the
tort
aspects
of
the
case
in
to
the
state
court,
it
seems
illogical
not
to
allow
sears
in
this
particular
circumstance,
property
owner
to
go
into
state
court
initially
to
have
that
dispute
resolved
without
the
necessity
of
exercising
self-help.
the
significance
or
the
benefit
of
state
court
in
this
particular
circumstance,
i
think
is
very
obvious
under
the
act
for
two
reasons.
first,
under
the
particular
factual
circumstances
under
which
this
case
arose,
there
was
no
availability
of
any
nlrb
relief.
since
sears
was
not
challenging
the
objective
of
the
picketing,
merely
its
location,
there
was
no
way
that
sears
initially
obtain
a
forum
before
the
board
to
resolve
this
dispute
but
even
if
there
were
some
procedure
for
doing
that,
at
best,
the
board
might
at
sometime
find
that
in
fact
the
union
activity
on
sears
premises
was
not
protected.
sears,
at
that
point
would
simply
have
to
go
into
court
to
enforce
the
board
orders
since
the
board
order
is
not
self
executing
and
would
be
right
back
where
we
were
fighting
it
out
in
a
court
at
some
later
time
rather
than
at
some
earlier
that
at
least
would
have
the
advantage
of
placing
the
issues
at
peace
between
the
parties
without
exercising
self-help.
if
this
proceeding
for
example,
had
gotten
back
into
the
california
state
courts
or
to
a
federal
district
court
to
enforce
a
board
order,
the
board
--
rather
the
court
would
not
of
course
necessarily
be
bound
by
the
nlrb
decision.
there
might
be
other
issues
that
would
have
to
be
raised
either
under
state
law
or
federal
law.
one
would
hope
that
the
court
would
give
due
deference
to
the
board
decision
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
determination
of
the
board
on
and
on
for
a
labor
practice
charge
is
not
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
in
a
subsequent
precision.
so
neither
from
terms
of
an
access
to
a
forum
nor
if
they
were
a
forum
is
a
proceeding
before
the
board
and
a
remedy,
an
effective
remedy
where
the
circumstances
involved
location
of
the
picketing
rather
than
its
objective.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
that
would
be
fine
if
the
sole
object
was
organizational,
of
course,
at
that
point
the
union
could
simply
change
the
object
of
the
picketing
to
informational
picketing
and
therefore
that
would
not
be
in
a
fairly
good
practice.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
solely?
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
if
they
were
picketing
solely
for
organizational
purposes
at
that
point
in
time,
sears
could
have
gone
to
the
board
however
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
submit
your
honor
that
our
position
would
be
the
same
for
this
reason.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
because
in
the
interim
of
time,
between
30
days
sears
could
have
exercised
self-help
and
removed
the
pickets
from
the
premises.
now
granted
that
may
have
engendered
the
quicker
filing
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
by
the
union
although
it
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
but
if
that
had
happened,
if
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
had
been
filed,
the
issues
as
to
the
exercise
of
self-help
which
still
have
had
to
been
resolved
in
state
court.
if
sears
for
example
had
affected
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
your
honor,
i
think
the
circumstances
would
not
change
in
effect
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
all
the
more
reason,
your
honor
why
access
to
state
court
should
be
permitted.
i
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
a
state
court
will
ignore
the
implications
of
the
act
or
any
other
principle
that
would
be
brought
to
its
attention
either
by
the
union
or
the
board
in
an
appropriate
case,
if
the
state
court
should
err
in
the
balancing
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
location
of
the
picketing
or
in
any
other
issue.
ultimately,
the
remedy
of
the
board
would
be
to
go
in
and
get
an
injunction
against
the
further
effectiveness
of
the
state
court
injunction.
there
is
a
remedy
for
the
board
and
the
union
under
those
circumstances.
there
really
is
no
remedy
for
the
employer,
if
one
must
to
wait
any
ultimate
determination
of
the
board.
but
your
honor's
question,
i
think
points
out
the
necessity
of
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
this
case.
in
effect,
when
these
issues
reach
state
court
on
the
self-help
or
a
tort
claim
and
the
courts
are
considering
the
defense,
the
activity
is
protected
under
the
act,
there
is
in
effect,
a
determination
whether
the
activity
is
actually
protected
rather
than
merely
arguable.
so
in
this
particular
circumstance
that
decision
as
to
whether
the
activity
is
truly
protected
would
be
made
at
an
earlier
stage
which
is
to
everybody's
advantage.
again,
if
the
state
court
errs
a
petition
could
be
made
to
modify
the
injunction
under
state
law
and
ultimately
if
the
board
or
the
union
felt
that
the
state
court
was
not
properly
deferring
to
some
federal
principle,
there
are
remedies
available
right
now
under
the
presence
to
that
law
for
going
in,
getting
injunction
and
on
the
principles
of
supremacy
of
the
state
court
injunction
would
dissipate.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
if
they
felt
that
they
truly
were
engaging
in
activity
which
was
protected
or
arguably
protected,
yes
they
could
have.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
that
effectively
is
the
alternative
suggested
by
the
union
after
the
long
discussion
on
the
basic
pre-emption
doctrine.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
no,
i
would
not
your
honor
because
under
the
current
state
of
the
law
where
you
exercise
self-help,
the
burden
of
a
delay
in
obtaining
a
board
decision
is
already
with
the
union.
so
allowing
this
dispute
to
be
resolved
in
a
civil
proceeding
does
not
shift
the
burden
of
a
delay,
anymore
than
it
is
under
current
law.
it
makes
it
a
more
peaceable
forum
but
it
does
not
shift
the
burden
of
delay,
and
as
i
mentioned
before
even
if
the
board
decided
in
sears
favor
in
this
particular
case
and
refused
to
issue
a
complain,
that
would
not
resolve
the
underlying
issue.
sears
would
still
have
to
go
into
court
at
that
point
and
obtain
some
type
of
injunctive
or
other
relief
as
to
which
the
board
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
unless
it
wanted
to
exercise
self-help
which
you
could
do
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
it
would
be
unwise
policy
to
encourage
violence
and
that
is
why
we
try
to
get
this
dispute
into
some
forum
to
resolve
it
without
the
physical
force
that
would
be
involved
in
self-help.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
yes
it
was.
although
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
an
order,
it
was
a
request
ultimately
and
in
fact
the
invitation
to
go
to
court
might
be
said
to
abend
the
unions
and
because
they
said
they
would
not
get
off
without
legal
process.
well,
at
that
point
in
time,
self-help
is
not
legal
process
in
the
sense
of
any
kind
of
a
judicial
or
administrative
proceeding.
we
could
not
go
to
the
board,
we
had
to
go
to
state
court.
i
submit
that
the
policy
should
be
since
there
is
already
these
kinds
of
issues
being
resolved
in
state
proceedings
of
various
kinds,
the
policy
should
be
to
encourage
the
dispute
into
a
neutral
forum
into
a
forum
that
will
be
able
to
hear
the
issues,
decide
the
issues
and
as
to
which
the
burden
of
delay
and
the
resolution
in
the
state
court
is
already
with
the
union.
it
is
simply
an
alternative
between
self-help
and
a
peaceable
resolution.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
believe
it
would
have
existed
at
both
stages
your
honor
but
most
certainly
i
would
not
dispute
that
they
could
have
chosen
the
file
charge,
if
they
wanted
to.
the
fact
that
they
did
not
do
so
is
discussed
in
the
trial
court
record
and
may
have
been
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
considered
in
determining
whether
in
fact
the
location
to
which
the
court
ultimately
limited
the
picketing
would
be
an
effective
one
or
whether
the
union
really
believed
that
it
was
engaging
in
protected
activity.
we
do
not
know
that
but
it
is
discussed
in
the
superior
court
record.
if
in
fact,
we
had
a
rule
in
this
situation
where,
in
response
of
justice
white's
question
sears
had
to
wait
until
the
board
resolved
the
issue,
which
i
have
indicated
would
not
truly
protect
sears
right.
in
effect,
we
are
condoning
what
may
be
in
proper
conduct
by
the
union
and
leaving
the
property
owner
without
a
remedy.
it
seems
that
it
would
be
more
effective
to
channel
it
into
the
forum
of
the
state
court.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
all
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
including
the
brief
of
the
board
do
concede,
i
believe
that
trespass,
the
regulation
of
trespass
is
a
valid
state
interest,
a
very
one
deeply
routed
state
interest.
so
i
submit
that
under
garmon,
under
one
of
the
exceptions
that
the
court
announced
that
the
fact
that
trespass
has
historically
been
a
matter
of
deep
state
interest,
every
state
has
laws
concerning
trespass
is
a
valid
ground
for
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
only
in
jurisdictional
questions
your
honor,
and
rarely
exercised
but
again
even
if
it
did
have
declaratory
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
even
if
it
did,
we
go
back
to
the
problem,
i
mentioned
earlier
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
believe
that
is
true
your
honor
but
still
would
not
be
self
executing
and
that
is
the
essential
problem
here.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
yes
your
honor.
in
response
to
the
question
i
believe
as
asked
by
mr
.justice
white,
the
problem
with
the
proposal
of
the
board
that
sears
file
a
charge
under
8(b)
is
of
course
i
believe,
i
mentioned
earlier
that
that
goes
only
to
the
objective.
it
does
not
deal
at
all
with
the
location,
so
even
in
this
case,
if
the
board
had
found
some
impermissible
objective,
the
union
could
simply
have
changed
that
objective
to
a
valid
one
and
we
would
be
right
back
where
we
started
now.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
both
the
board
and
the
union
have
conceded
in
the
briefs
that
there
are
some
trespass
situations
which
are
already
subject
to
injunction
under
state
law,
they
give
the
example,
of
the
marshall
field
case
where
you
actually
have
people
coming
in
to
physical
confines
of
the
store,
having
made
that
concession
that
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
there,
i
assume
that
must
be
on
the
basis
that
there
is
already
a
board
decision
that
that
activity
is
actually
not
protected,
therefore
it
is
not
very
far
adjunct
to
allowing
the
court
to
determine
that
same
thing
in
the
context
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
for
the
very
reasons,
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
whenever
a
court
either
a
state
or
federal,
ultimately
resolves
these
issues.
in
effect,
they
are
deciding
whether
there
is
actual
protection,
not
merely
arguable
protection
and
many
times
of
course
they
do
disagree
with
the
board,
as
to
that
concept.
i
do
not
want
to
burden
this
argument
too
lengthy
by
arguably
state
law
because,
i
do
believe
that
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
an
opportunity
to
resolve
the
issues
of
state
law
raised
by
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
statute
to
which
they
refer
became
effective
january
1,
'76.
so
this
case
was
argued,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct
that
before
the
california
supreme
court
april
of
'76,
the
california
supreme
court
decision
was
in
september
of
'76.
if
the
court
had
felt
compelled
by
any
of
the
arguments
under
state
law,
that
were
raised
now
by
the
union,
it
is
to
be
assumed
they
would
have
resolved
them
not
having
done
so,
apparently
there
was
agreement
with
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
the
california
state
law
did
not
preclude
the
issue
of
the
injunction
and
in
fact
we
have
cited
two
court
of
appeal
decisions
in
california
interpreting
the
new
statute,
while
although
they
deal
with
somewhat
factually
different
situations
in
construing
the
intent
of
the
law,
the
new
law,
say
was
not
intended
to
change
preexisting
law,
there
still
must
be
a
determination
for
example
whether
the
pickets
have
a
right
to
lawfully
be
at
the
location
of
which
they---
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
not
the
new
statute
your
honor.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
yes.
in
any
case
both
of
those
california
court
of
appeal
decisions
which
indicate
that
the
new
law
does
not
change
the
preexisting
law
were
denied
hearings
by
the
california
supreme
court
which
in
california
is
equivalent
to
a
decision
on
the
merits,
not
necessarily
agreeing
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
but
with
the
decision,
and
citable
as
precedent.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
where
it
may
lawfully
be
and
therefore
still
leaves
open
the
entire
issues
presented
in
this
case,
can
they
lawfully
be
where
we
say
they
could
not
lawfully
be,
correct.
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
do
not
think,
the
mail
box
situation
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
at
all.
i
had
the
impression
that
we
were
perhaps
re-arguing
central
hardware
and
those
cases
during
the
argument
of
that
issue,
certainly
it
is
not
--
mr.
h.
warren
siegel
i
do
not
know,
the
post
office
requested
serious
permission
to
put
it
there
according
to
the
record
and
sears
said
yes,
there
is
--
stack
situations
does
not
prevent
the
union
from
requesting
permission,
at
least
conceivably,
i
doubt
it,
but
conceivably
getting
permission,
but
the
point
in
there
is
even
the
post
office
recognized
sears
property
right
to
that
location
by
requesting
permission
to
put
it
there
and
sears
did
consent.
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
i
really
have
nothing
further
there.
thank
you
.
