we
will
hear
arguments
next
in

sears,
roebuck
against
san
diego
county
council.
mr.
siegel,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
ordered
them
off
the
premises,
was
that
not
the
first
step
in
self-help?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
siegel,
mr.
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
order
did
the
court
issue
on
those
affidavits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
it
not
a
reasonable
assumption
that
the
judge
believed
them
or
he
would
not
have
signed
the
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
union
have
gone
to
the
board
as
soon
as
they
were
requested
or
ordered
to
leave
the
premises
and
terminate
the
trespass,
allege
trespass?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
make
it
to
public
because
they
put
a
mailbox
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
hotel
has
a
mailbox
in
the
side
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
know
what
colors
they
are
and
that
is
a
mailbox
outside
the
hotel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
an
invitation
to
come
on
the
premises
to
mail
a
letter
perhaps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
shown
in
the
record
here?
the
claim
of
that
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
our
plan,
what
difference
it
makes
to
your
case
whether
there
was
or
was
not
any
mailbox
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
your
situation
in
terms
of
the
trespassers,
any
different
from
hotel
workers
lobbying
--
the
picketing
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel,
because
there
is
a
mail
box
there?
chief

warren
e.

am
wondered
why
counsel
is
resting
so
much
on
mail
box.

case
