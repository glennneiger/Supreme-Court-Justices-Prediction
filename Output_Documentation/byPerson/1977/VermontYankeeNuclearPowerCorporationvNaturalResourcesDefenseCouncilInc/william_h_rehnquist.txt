justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
agency
suddenly
doesn't
have
to
marshal
its
own
evidence
under
a
notice
and
comment
per
se,
does
it?
it's
presumed
to
have
the
expertise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
do
you
know
without
reference
to
record
when
vermont
yankee's
license
was
originally
issued?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
that
affect
vermont
yankee's
license
that
was
issued
in
‘72?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
happen
and
if
the
court,
we
have
not
granted
certiorari
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
been
left
standing,
would
that
have
had
some
effect
on
vermont
yankee's
1972
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
statutory
limitations
period
on
the
time
to
appeal
from
the
grant
of
license,
such
as
those
granted
in
‘72?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
that
authority
come
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
supposing
you
have
a
license,
say
a
40
year
license,
version
1965
and
no
ground
of
authority
to
the
commission
in
terms
to
reopen
for
this
reason,
do
you
say
the
commission
can
just
reopen
and
reconsider
the
license,
without
any
mandate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
just
said
it
could.
you
said
it
could
be
considering
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
72
license
and
the
time
for
contesting
may
well
have
expired
before
any
proceedings
were
brought.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
an
adjudicatory
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
then
is
that
your
client
did
appeal
from
the
actual
granting
of
the
license
in
'72,
within
the
60
day
period.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
uphold
the
rulemaking
proceeding
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
vermont
yankee's
license
is
also
valid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeal
set
it
back
and
the
commission
did
consider
inaptly
or
not
properly
in
your
view
though,
well,
waste
production
in
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
the
commission's
determination
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
that
vermont
yankee's
license
should
be
continued
to
be
valid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
commission's
present
position
as
you
understand
on
the
validity
of
vermont
yankee's
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
subsequent
presumed
vermont
yankee
wouldn't
have
any
license
at
all
even
though
we
were
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
if
they
weren't
for
this
subsequent
proceeding
in
july
of
this
year,
that
vermont
yankee
wouldn't
have
any
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
napa,
preparation
of
napa
statement
requires
an
adjudicatory
hearing
or
that
say
or
that
the
licensing
issue
requires
an
adjudicatory
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
curious
on
what
you
said,
what
your
position
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that's
required
by
statue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
you
need
anything
as
open
to
the
public
as
rule
making
for
the
preparation
of
a
napa
statement
if
you're
not
us
doing
a
separate
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
what
your
authority,
decisional
authority
from
this
court
that
preparation
of
any
napa
statement
must
confirm
at
least
with
a
rule
making
standards
of
the
apa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
case
from
this
court
your
relying
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
particular
ones
by
name?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
apa
says
there
are
two
different
ways
you
can
go
about
conducting
hearings.
one
is
if
it's
a
rulemaking
proceeding,
it's
533
and
one
of
it's
adjudication
and
you
don't
certainly
content
that
anything
more
than
a
rulemaking
proceeding
is
required
for
your
ordinary
nepa
statement,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
your
authority
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
for
the
–
for
the
case
law
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
from
this
court,
kleppe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
feel
the
court
of
appeals
more
adequately
divined
the
state
of
world
opinion
than
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wanted
to
depose
the
individual
members
of
acrs
to
join?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
congress
intended
any
more
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
this
case
they
were
made
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
that
the
statute
requires
is
that
the
letter
be
spread
of
record,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
i
wasn't
asking
what
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on,
i
was
asking
what
congress
focused
on.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
consolidated
cases
involve
the
licensing
of
nuclear
power
plants.
in
76-419,
the
vermont
yankee
case,
after
a
hearing
before
the
licensing
board
of
what
is
now
called
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
petitioner
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
corporation
was
awarded
a
license
to
operate
a
nuclear
a
power
plant
in
vernon,
vermont.
shortly
therefore
the
commission
promulgated
a
rule
to
the
effect
that
it
was
necessary
in
licensing
proceedings
to
consider
the
environmental
effects
of
operations
to
reprocess
nuclear
fuel
or
dispose
of
waste
resulting
from
the
reprocessing
operations.
the
commission
then
reexamined
vermont
yankee's
operating
license
in
light
of
this
new
rule
and
determined
that
vermont
yankee
should
still
retain
its
license.
upon
a
challenge
initiated
by
the
respondent
national
resources
defense
council
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbian
circuit,
the
rule
was
invalidated
because
the
procedures
employed
by
the
agency
in
promulgating
a
rule
were
in
the
opinion
of
that
court
inadequate
despite
the
fact
of
the
agency
employed
all
the
procedures
expressly
required
by
the
terms
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
further
ruled
that
the
commission
must
reconsider
under
a
validly
promulgated
rule,
it's
decision
with
respect
of
vermont
yankee's
operating
license.
in
76-528
the
consumer's
power
case,
again
after
the
required
administrative
hearing,
the
licensing
board
awarded
a
permit
to
petitioner
consumer's
power
company
to
construct
two
nuclear
reactors
in
midland,
michigan.
the
court
of
appeals
again
ordered
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
decision.
this
time
the
court
ruled
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
for
construction
of
the
reactors
was
fatally
defective,
and
because
it
failed
to
examine
energy
conservation
measures
as
an
alternative
to
plants
of
the
size
presently
contemplated
by
consumers.
the
court
also
held
that
the
report
given
to
the
commission
by
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
was
insufficient,
and
the
commission
should
have
on
its
motion,
so
to
speak,
sent
the
report
back
to
the
committee
for
further
elucidation.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
important
questions
of
administrative
law
raised
by
these
rulings.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
today,
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
misapplied
the
statutory
and
decisional
law
which
caution
reviewing
courts
against
improperly
intruding
into
an
agency's
decision
making
process
and
against
engrafting
their
own
notions
of
proper
procedures
upon
agencies
entrusted
with
substantive
functions
by
congress.
indeed
administrative
decision
should
be
set
aside
only
for
substantial
procedural
or
substantive
reasons
as
mandated
by
statute.
yet
some
of
the
court's
reasons
in
this
case
for
ordering
a
remand
in
this
case
are
at
best
insubstantial.
we
are
left
with
a
distinct
impression
that
the
review
in
this
case
can
fairly
be
described
as
judicial
intervention
run
riot.
congress
has
made
fundamental
policy
choices
regarding
the
development
and
use
of
nuclear
energy
and
those
choices
are
not
subject
to
reexamination
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
guise
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
time
may
prove
wrong
the
decision
to
develop
nuclear
energy
as
it
may
prove
wrong
countless
other
legislative
decisions.
but
it
is
congress
and
the
appropriate
agencies
which
must
eventually
make
any
such
judgment.
it
is
not
one
entrusted
to
the
courts,
upon
remand
the
court
is
of
course
free
to
examine
the
rule
under
the
standard
of
review
enunciated
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
