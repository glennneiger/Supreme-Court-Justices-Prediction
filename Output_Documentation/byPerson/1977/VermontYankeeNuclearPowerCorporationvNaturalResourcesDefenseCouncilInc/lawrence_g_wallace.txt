mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
here
came
in
the
course
of
an
evolving
process
of
how
the
commission
has
been
handling
the
licensing
of
nuclear
power
plants.
there
are
some
65
presently
in
operation
in
the
country,
some
of
which
receive
their
licenses,
including
their
operating
licenses
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
in
1969,
and
the
process
has
evolved
considerably
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
and
i'll
explain
that
briefly.
at
the
time
that
vermont
yankee's
operating
license
was
issued,
the
commission
took
the
position
that
it
would
give
no
consideration
to
questions
of
reprocessing
and
waste
management
and
disposal
during
the
licensing
proceedings,
although
shortly
thereafter,
it
adopted
the
1974
fuel
cycle
rule
in
which
in
recognition
of
the
fact,
that
waste
problems
are
irretrievably
set
in
motion
by
the
granting
of
the
license
to
a
plant.
it
decided
that
it
should
factor
in
to
the
extent
it's
possible
to
do
so,
some
environmental
values
reflected
in
the
management
and
disposal
of
waste
and
in
reprocessing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
operating
license?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe,
it's
1972,
is
that
correct?
and
the
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside,
the
fuel
cycle
rule
was
adopted
in
1974
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
did
not.
at
that
time,
the
commission
decided
that
that
rule
would
be
applied
prospectively
only
and
not
to
existing
licenses
such
as
vermont
yankee's
because
the
values
reflected
in
the
table
to
be
applied
under
that
rule
were
not
significant
enough
to
be
likely
to
affect
the
balance,
the
cost-benefit
balance
that
had
been
determined
in
taking
and
in
measuring
the
environmental
effects
of
these
licenses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
grant
of
the
license.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
done
without
taking
into
account
waste
reprocessing
and
disposal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
sure
there
is,
but
no
one
to
my
knowledge
contended
that
the
setting
aside
of
the
license
was
untimely
here,
it
was
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
order,
there
is
a
portion
of
the
opinion
devoted
to
setting
aside
the
license
as
well
as
a
portion
devoted
to
setting
aside
the
rule
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
it
was
proper
to
proceed
under
a
valid
rule
and
to
take
account
of
this
environmental
factor
which
after
all
is
a
generic
factor.
we're
not
talking
about
the
particular
reprocessing
or
disposal
facilities,
when
we
are
dealing
with
these
individual
licenses,
but
it
was
proper
to
do
this
by
a
valid
rule,
but
that
this
wasn't
a
valid
rule
and
that
in
the
absence
of
applying
a
valid
rule,
the
licensing
proceeding
was
invalid
for
not
having
taken
this
factor
into
account.
both
aspects
of
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
commission.
now
in
so
far
as
this
remand
was
based
on
a
finding
of
inadequacy
in
the
record
which
was
the
sole
basis
in
judge
tam's
concurring
opinion
and
arguably
a
or
the
basis
elsewhere,
the
matter
is
from
the
commission's
standpoint
largely
academic
now.
the
1974
rule
has
been
replaced
by
the
interim
rule
to
which
we
refer
on
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief
and
the
commission
has
now
undertaken
to
replace
the
interim
rule
with
a
permanent
rule.
moreover,
the
interim
rule
has
been
applied
to
the
vermont
yankee
case
in
decision
of
july
18,
1977
by
the
commission's
appeal
board
that
is
reprinted
as
a
supplement
to
a
supplemental
brief
just
submitted
by
respondent
in
the
case
and
in
that
decision
the
appeal
board
determined
that
the
values
in
the
revised
table
to
be
used
in
the
interim
rule
when
applied
to
the
vermont
yankee
application
do
not
tip
of
the
balance
of
costs
and
benefits
previously
determined
in
the
environmental
survey
done
there.
and
the
commission
as
appeal
board
reached
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
11
other
facilities
in
a
decision
in
august
of
this
year
at
six
nuclear
regulatory
commission
206,
the
decision
involving
vermont
yankee
appears
at
six
nuclear
regulatory
commission
page
25.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
we
really
think
from
our
standpoint
it
no
longer
matters,
we
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
court
need
make
that
determination.
we
have
lodged
with
the
court,
the
environmental
survey
on
which
the
new
interim
rule
was
based,
devoted
to
entire
really
questions
of
reprocessing
and
waste
management.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
but
for
purposes
of
vermont
yankee's
application,
we've
already
applied
the
interim
rule
and
are
intending
complete
our
rule-making
proceedings
and
to
apply
the
permanent
rule
to
vermont
yankee,
so
that,
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
no
longer
of
concern
to
the
commission's
procedures
and
i
think
the
commission
would
have
the
authority
to
proceed
that
way
regardless
of
whether
this
court
were
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
about
the
adequacy
of
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
wont
need
them,
but
we
are
going
to
proceed
with
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
does
have
the
authority
to
apply
the
interim
rule
existing
licenses
when
issues
have
been
raised
about
the
fuel
cycle
effects
on
the
environment
with
respect
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
i
would
have
to
refer
to
the
statutory
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
has
not
attempted
to
do
so,
it
has
not
attempted
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
the
authority
with
respect
to
this
one
because
it's
still
being
contested.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
should
that
issue
be
raised,
the
commission
would
have
to
address
it,
we
just
have
not,
we
have
not,
we
are
planning
to
go
ahead
with
the
rule-making
proceeding
that's
now
underway
and
as
i
say,
the
interim
rule
is
based
on
a
much
more
substantial
evidentiary
survey
devoted
entirely
to
waste
management,
and
disposal
and
reprocessing
issues,
than
was
the
basis
of
the
rule,
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
and
which
is
no
longer
in
effect
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
commission's
interim
rule?
that
was
adopted
i
don't
recall,
but
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
77,
i
am
told,
it's
relatively
recent
and
it's
to
be
in
effect
for
18
months.
now,
what
the
commission
is
concerned
about
however
is
the
procedural
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
in
adopting
the
interim
rule,
it
followed
the
statutorily
prescribed
procedures
of
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
if
rather
than
afford
additional
procedures
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
hindsight
had
been
required
in
the
other
rulemaking
proceeding,
although
the
court
of
appeals
never
spelled
out
what
those
procedures
should
be
and
with
respect
to
the
new
rule
to
be
adopted,
the
commission
is
not
proposing
to
engage
in
an
adjudicatory
type
of
rulemaking
with
rights
of
discovery
and
cross-examination.
it
has
invited
the
participants
to
suggest
questions
and
follow-up
questions
for
the
board
to
ask
witnesses
at
the
hearing
to
be
held
in
connection
with
the
new
rule,
but
there
are
practical
reasons
why
the
commission
chooses
not
to
proceed
in
an
adjudicatory
manner
as
no
statute
requires
it
to
do.
with
respect
to
the
1974
rule,
there
were
some
40
individuals
in
organizations
who
participated
and
the
commission
anticipates
that
at
least
as
large
a
number
will
be
concerned
with
the
hearings
with
respect
to
the
new
rule.
it
has
already
received
comments
and
proposed
questions
across
and
follow-up
questions
which
are
quite
voluminous,
and
there
are
practical
limits
to
the
use
of
an
adjudicatory
process
in
a
rulemaking
proceeding
of
this
kind
if
the
distinction
between
rulemaking
and
adjudication
is
to
perform
the
function
that
was
conceived
for
it
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
for
that
reason,
the
commission
is
concerned
with
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
what
it
portends
for
the
commission's
ability
to
proceed
through
rulemaking
with
what
the
commission
considers
to
be
more
appropriate
responses
to
these
problems
in
the
licensing
of
plants
and
it
believes
that
the
procedural
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
as
far
as
we're
able
to
tell,
purely
on
the
court
of
appeal's
dissatisfaction
with
the
results
that
were
reached
in
the
1974
rule,
rather
than
with
any
infirmity
that
it
could
point
to
in
the
proceedings
adopted
from
the
perspective
of
the
time
when
the
commission
adopted
them
should
be
set
aside.
indeed,
there
was
no
showing
to
the
commission
at
any
particularized
need
for
discovery
or
cross-examination
with
respect
to
any
of
the
issues
with
which
the
court
of
appeals
later
decided
the
record
was
inadequate.
now
i
should
say
that
that
the
interim
rule
has
not
yet
been
applied
to
the
midland
power
of
facility
involved
in
the
companion
case,
the
consumer's
power
case,
but
its
application
is
pertinent
to
a
proceeding
that
is
presently
pending
before
the
appeal
board
and
it's
anticipated
that
the
interim
rule
will
be
applied
in
that
proceeding
in
the
same
way.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
found
two
additional
shortcomings
in
the
commission's
proceedings
which
we
have
dealt
with
in
our
brief
and
which
mr.
horsky
will
deal
with
in
his
argument.
