mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
corporation
through
the
petitioner
in
number
76-419
and
my
argument
will
be
confined
to
that
case
and
the
issues
which
are
raised
therein.
this
matter
comes
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
at
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
that
for
it,
two
actions
of
the
united
states
nuclear
regulatory
commission.
first
the
action
of
that
commission
in
granting
and
operating
license
to
the
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
station,
a
nuclear
electric
generating
station
located
in
vernon,
vermont
and
owned
by
my
client
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
corporation,
the
petitioner.
in
addition,
it
has
before
it
the
promulgation
by
that
agency
of
a
regulation
which
for
the
first
time
permitted
in
individual
reactor
licensing
cases
limited
consideration
of
the
environmental
affects
of
the
separately
licensed
and
located
facilities
where
the
various
matters
such
as
reactor
field
manufacturing
and
reprocessing
and
waste
disposal
activities
take
place.
these
activities
are
sometimes
referred
to
and
i
referred
to
them
as
the
fuel
cycle
activities.
by
its
judgments
the
united
state
court
of
appeals
struck
down
the
agency's
regulation
on
the
ground
that
insufficient
procedures
had
been
utilized
in
its
promulgation.
the
court
also
remanded
the
agency
decision
authorizing
the
assurance
of
an
operating
license
to
vermont
yankee
on
the
grounds
that
issuance
of
any
such
license
had
to
be
preceded
by
what
the
court
called
a
thorough
‘ventilation'
of
the
environmental
effects
of
the
fuel
cycle
activities.
now
though
procedurally
complex
and
as
laid
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
at
pages
11
through
25,
this
case
i
respectfully
submit
is
substantively
quite
simple.
the
result
below
--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
held
an
operating
license,
but
that
operating
license
at
this
time
is
good
for
18
months
only
to
what
the
duration
of
the
so
called
interim
rule
which
the
commission
has
adopted.
i
do
not
believe
this
case
is
moot
which
is
being
suggested
by
this
late
filed
brief
because
when
vermont
yankee
went
into
the
court
of
appeals,
vermont
yankee
had
a
full
term
40-year
license.
we
have
a
license
now
under
this
interim
rule,
but
--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
we
came
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
we
had
a
remand
of
the
decision
authorizing
a
license.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
now
we
have
a
license
which
license
is
given
to
us
under
the
interim
rule
which
self
destructs
in
18
months
therefore
--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
the
question
then
will
be,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
new
rule
in
place
as
to
whether
vermont
yankee's
license
would
continue,
or
whether
the
commission
takes
some
other
action.
but
it
is
our
position
that
vermont
yankee
had
a
good
40
year
license
at
the
start
and
that
this
court
should
enforce
that
initial
decision
of
the
commission.
that
vermont
yankee
should
not
have
to
litigate
further
for
its
full-term
license.
now
as
i
indicated
i
believe
this
case
is
quite
simple
substantively.
to
begin
with,
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
an
agency
regulation
on
the
basis
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
is
to
be
construed
as
in
effect
amending
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
require
all
agencies
to
provide
more
than
the
noticed
increment
proceeding
called
4
and
5
u.s.
code
section
553,
in
any
rule
making
proceedings
which
affect
the
environmental
responsibilities
of
the
agency.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
petitioner's
license
as
the
result
of
a
holding
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
should
be
read
as
amending
the
atomic
energy
act
in
substance
by
saying
that
the
technical
and
economic
resolution
of
the
so-called
high
level
nuclear
waste
question
should
be
undertaken
and
indeed
essentially
resolved
as
to
methodology
prior
to
the
issuance
of
any
more
reactor
licenses.
now
third,
the
court
of
appeals
accomplished
all
of
this
through
the
device
of
utilizing
extra
record
evidence
which
was
never
presented
to
the
agency
in
either
the
vermont
yankee
case
or
the
rulemaking
proceeding.
indeed,
it
consisted
of
articles
that
were
written
after
the
rule
was
promulgated
and
in
one
case
after
the
case
was
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
were
utilized
to
setup
a
supposed
conflict
with
theretofore
uncontested
expert
testimony
of
an
agency
staff
member.
and
having
done
that,
the
court
of
appeals
then
held
that
the
rule
was
not
well
supported
as
a
result
of
procedural
misfeasance.
now
we
believe
the
decision
to
be
an
error
for
a
number
of
reasons
as
set
forth
in
our
brief.
in
the
first
place,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
decision
is
flatly
contrary
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
national
environmental
policy
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
in
its
decision
the
court
of
appeals
admits
that
the
requirements
of
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
were
exceeded
in
this
case
and
indeed,
they
of
course
were.
there
was
an
opportunity
for
comment;
there
was
an
oral
hearing,
an
opportunity
for
comments
on
the
comments
and
an
opportunity
after
that
for
comments
on
the
comments
on
the
comments.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
that
is
our
view
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
exceeded
the
requirements
of
section
553,
but
that
that
was
not
enough
to
comply
with
the
act.
and
it
is
our
belief
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
section
553
means
precisely
what
it
says.
also
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
cannot
be
read
as
amending
other
statutes.
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
the
court
below
was
saying
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
works
sub
silentio
and
amendment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
scrap
cases
preclude
such
a
holding.
we
also
submit
that
this
decision
transgresses
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
the
recent
(inaudible)
case.
the
(inaudible)
decisions
stands
for
the
proposition
that
feasibility
and
practicality
have
to
govern
in
some
respect
the
working
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
the
scope
of
an
agency's
responsibility
there
under.
as
it's
clear
from
this
record,
two
boards
of
this
agency,
both
of
which
had
majority,
two
members
who
were
technically
trained
people
found
that
it
was
essentially
a
practical
impossibility
to
consider
in
detail
in
an
individual
reactor
licensing
proceeding,
the
activities
that
would
take
place
at
a
fuel
cycle
proceeding
yet
to
be
applied
for.
in
addition
these
two
boards
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
proposal
before
them
as
that
term
is
used
in
nepa
was
the
licensing
of
vermont
yankee
not
the
licensing
of
these
other
facilities.
therefore
these
boards
ruled,
we
need
not
get
into
this
at
all.
i
respectfully
suggest
those
rulings
though
much
earlier
then
are
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
we
also
maintain
that
this
decision
basically
contravenes
a
long
history
which
shows
an
intent
in
congress
that
the
solving
of
the
so-called
high
level
waste
problem
is
not
a
matter
that
must
precede
the
issuance
of
reactor
licenses.
this
is
laid
out
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
but
it
is
clear
that
what
this
court
wanted
was
the
waste
problem
to
be
solved
and
i
would
note
that
at
page
78
at
of
appendix
judge
tam
says
it
flatly,
he
says
i
agree
with
the
majority
that
nepa
requires
the
commission
fully
to
assure
itself
that
safe
and
adequate
storage
methods
are
technologically
and
economically
feasible,
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
history
in
congress
is
that
congress
has
been
aware
since
1954
that
the
final
selection
and
the
final
decisions
on
this
matter
have
not
been
made
and
congress
has
made
no
move
to
stop
the
licensing
of
reactors.
now
essentially,
what
is
argued
in
response
to
these
various
arguments,
in
response
to
mr.,
justice
stewart
earlier,
i
addressed
this
question
of
whether
the
case
has
become
moot.
a
second
argument
that
is
made
to
this
court
is
this
is
just
a
record
case,
that
the
court
below
just
found
a
record
inadequate
and
it's
really
not
worthy
of
this
court's
attention.
i
can
only
quote
what
the
court
itself
said
the
issue
before
it
said
“thus
we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
procedures
provided
by
the
agency
were
sufficient
to
ventilate
the
issues”
that
is
what
they
thought
they
were
deciding
in
the
rule
making
case
and
i
submit
that
that
is
what
they
did
decide
and
decided
it
erroneously.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
with
this
court
if
i
did
not
admit
that
this
opinion
admits
of
different
readings
by
different
people.
on
the
other
hand
i
would
remind
this
court
that
to
let
this
decision
stand
i
respectfully
suggest
means
chaos
in
the
administrative
process
of
the
united
states
this
time,
not
only
in
this
agency
but
in
other
agencies
because
no
agency
can
now
be
sure
precisely
what
it
must
go
through
in
order
to
promulgate
a
valid
rule.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
if
ventilation
even
be
a
requirement,
ventilation
in
this
opinion
to
me
is
one
of
those
catchy
words
that
is
about
find
its
way
in
to
american
jurisprudence
and
i
think
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
because
i
don't
know
how
to
construct
this
ventilator,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
at
an
agency
will
know
precisely
how
to
construct
this
ventilator.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
no
i
think
it's
--
the
ventilator
has
been
constructed
by
the
congress
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
therefore
this
is
why
we
think
this
decision
is
an
error.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
in
so
far
as
my
client
is
concerned
mr.
justice,
i
think
a
remand
with
a
direction
to
affirm
the
vermont
yankee
decision
is
in
order
certainly,
because
my
client's
right
to
that
license
i
suggest
does
not
depend
on
valid
rule.
i
think
our
license
was
validly
issued
without
the
rule.
if
the
court
concludes,
there
is
a
problem
with
the
record,
i
think
the
most
it
should
be
done
is
to
ask
the
agency
for
a
further
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
because
i
think
that's
the
only
record
required
in
notice
and
comment
it
well
be
the
no
comment
are
made.
so
what
the
congress
must
have
intended
is
that
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
be
alright
as
far
as
reviewing
court
is
concerned.
so
i
think
the
most
that
is
necessary
here
is
a
remand
for
further
explanation.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
it
is
not
required
to
marshal
it
and
it
is
not
required
to
answer
every
single
statement
that
is
made
to
it
either
by
somebody
outside
the
agency,
and
i
think
that
that
is
another
danger
in
this
decision.
what
this
decision
means
is
that
if
any
person
comes
in
with
any
difference
of
opinion
he
can
send
a
federal
agency
into
years
of
study
to
strike
down
what
they
and
their
expert
judgment
have
already
decided
is
not
necessary
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
what
the
agency
has
done
is
hold
a
interim
rule
proceeding
which
really
consisted
of
a
further
literature
search.
they
certainly
have
engaged
no
additional
procedures
mr.
justice
but
they
have
had
an
additional
literature
search
which
backs
up
this
new
interim
rule.
this
interim
rule
as
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
is
on
appeal
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
is
also
on
appeal
because
the
vermont
yankee
decision
and
seabrook
has
been
brought
to
the
first
circuit.
i
would
imagine
the
first
circuit
will
hold
in
abeyance
until
such
time
is
either
this
court
speaks
or
the
dc
circuit
speaks
after
this
court
speaks.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
a
petition
for
review
has
been
filed
and
at
the
request
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case
is
being
held
in
advance
until
this
court
acts.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
as
far
as
vermont
yankee
is
concerned
of
course
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
precisely
this
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
that
is
my
belief.
and
as
to
the
agency,
while
it
maybe
true
that
there
has
been
a
change
here,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
unlikely
that
case
will
reach
this
court,
until
after
the
18
month
rule
has
expired
and
i
suggest
we
have
got
chaos
in
the
agencies
until
--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
speak
on
the
interim
rule
until
this
court
speaks
--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
that
would
solve
the
problem,
but
i
must
say
i
consider
that
highly
unlikely,
because
the
interim
rule
is
on
the
same
procedures
as
the
rule
that
–
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
then
that
would
be
this
court's--
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
no,
i
think
if
this
court
instructed
the
court
of
appeals
that
its
procedures
were
wrong,
the
result
would
be
that
they
would
uphold
the
interim
rule.
mr.
thomas
g.
dignan,
jr.
but
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
mr.
justice,
i
thought
you
were
assuming
this
court
did
not
speak
on
the
subject.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
thank
the
court.
