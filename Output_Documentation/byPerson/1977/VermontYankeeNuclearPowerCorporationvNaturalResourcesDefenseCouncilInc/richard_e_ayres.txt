mr.
richard
e.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
the
issues
in
the
vermont
yankee
case
and
mr.
cherry
will
follow
me
and
address
the
issues
in
the
other
case.
i
think
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
like
to
make
two
points
clear
at
the
outset
that
do
not
seem
to
have
been
a
court
had
much
importance
on
the
presentation
you
have
heard.
the
first
is
that
this
case
arises
or
these
two
cases
arise
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
as
this
court
has
said
has
two
purposes;
one
is
that
to
require
disclosure
by
government
agencies
who
are
considering
going
forward
with
the
project
to
other
decision-makers
and
to
the
public
in
general
with
the
theory
being
that
disclosure
will
tend
to
produce
better
decisions,
less
environmentally
damaging
decisions.
the
other
is
that
by
requiring
the
presentation
of
an
environmental
impact
statement,
nepa
is
designed
to
encourage
agencies
to
exercise
foresight
to
foresee
the
long-range
consequences
of
the
things
they
undertake
for
short
range
benefits
and
we
think
the
issues
that
were
involved
in
vermont
yankee
case
are
classic
instances
of
how
important
that
requirement
is.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
it's
the
supplemental
statement
of
facts.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
thought
given
to
whether
that
issue
should
be
raised
and
i
am
afraid
i
accept
some
blame
for
having
not
provided
that
material
to
the
court
earlier.
we
do
think
it's
relevant
however
to
the
decision
and
would
have
wanted
to
submit
it
at
whatever
time.
the
issues
i
said
that
are
raised
in
the
litigation--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
by
the
commission
in
this
case,
you'll
see
that
their
position
is
first
that
the
vermont
yankee
should
have
a
license
under
the
interim
rule.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes
and
second
that
had
this
case
come
before
them
in
1971,
they
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
because
essentially,
the
fact
the
plant
was
built
and
operating,
essentially
because
of
the
cost
involved.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
but
they
did
that
in
the
absence
of
any
consideration
of
waste
issues
at
all.
what
they're
saying
in
this
decision
is
when
we
consider
waste
issues
as
we
see
them
then
we
still
conclude
that
the
plant
should
be
licensed
and
i
think
that
we
can
also
anticipate
for
certain
that
when
a
final
rule
is
promulgated
the
same
decision
will
be
applied
given
the
reasoning
in
that
opinion.
so
we
think
that
as
to
vermont
yankee,
the
issue
of
what
to
vermont
yankee
can
operate
with
this
license
is
really
a
settled
issue
and
that
is
the
issue
on
which
the
court
granted
cert
and
there
was
as
you
recall.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well
there
maybe
some
room
for
interpretation
there
and
we
of
course
did
not
make
any
statement
or
position
when
we
brought
this
to
the
court's
attention,
but
we
think
it's
clear
if
one
looks
at
the
reasoning
there
and
also
at
the
rule
that's
being
proposed
as
a
final
rule,
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
interim
rule
and
which
again
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
rules
that
was
under
review
in
this
case,
that
vermont
yankee's
license
is
free
and
clear
and
frankly
from
the
position
of
those
parties,
who
challenged
it
in
the
beginning,
my
clients,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
the
issue
that
we
are
concerned
about
is
the
way
the
commission
is
dealt
with
the
nuclear
waste
problem,
its
refusal
to
make
available
to
the
public,
information
about
the
situation
and
that
issue
now
has
moved
into
the
arena
of
the
s3
table
and
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
right.
and
so
we
are
un-concerned
that
vermont
yankee
has
a
license
and
we
did
this
and
nor
did
file
any
sort
of
appeal
on
the
grating
of
that
license.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
why
do
we
bring
up
vermont
yankee?
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
it
does
mean
something,
we
think
it
means
that
there
are
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
but
they
are
i
think
assured
on
the
basis
that
reasoning
of
holding
that
license
also.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
given
the
reasoning
in
this
opinion
and
given
the
direction
the
commission
is
going,
yes
it
is.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
they
brought
--
you
have
to
recall,
this
proceeding
has
been
going
on
now
for
six
years,
it
arose
when
vermont
yankee
sought
an
operating
license
and
the
parties
who
are
now
the
respondents
before
you
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
1970,
well,
69
perhaps
when
they
started
--
the
parties
went
before
the
commission
to
ask
that
the
commission
address
the
environmental
effects
of
the
waste
disposal
and
reprocessing
of
the
waste
from
this
plant.
the
commission
refused
to
consider
that
issue.
the
parties
who
are
now
before
you
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
commission
then
changed
his
position
and
said
we
take
it
back,
these
are
issues
that
should
be
before
the
licensing
board
when
it
looks
at
the
environmental
impact
of
any
given
power
plant.
however,
we're
going
to
hold
a
different
kind
of
proceeding,
we're
going
to
have
a
rule
making
proceeding
and
look
at
this
issue
generically.
when
that
generic
proceeding
was
complete,
the
respondents
sought
review
of
that
issue
also
and
the
court
brought
the
two
cases
together
and
decided
them.
in
another
words,
the
original
license
given
to
vermont
yankee
was
given
with
no
consideration
of
the
environmental
impact
waste
even
though
later
the
(inaudible)
that
was
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
whether
vermont
yankee's
license
was
properly
granted.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
let
me
clarify
slightly.
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
remanded
the
license
of
vermont
yankee,
pending
the
outcome
of
further
proceedings
by
the
commission
to
establish
an
adequate
record
on
the
issue
of
voice
disposal.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
it
didn't
take
nine
years.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
the
commission
undertook
the
rule
making
involved
in
this
in
this
case
in
1972.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
the
case
that
involved
--
the
case
involves
vermont
yankee
was
started
in
1971.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
71.
that
case
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that
case
has
taken
this
long
only
because
the
commission
has
gone
through
a
separate
rule
making
proceeding,
has
complicated
the
issues.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
but
the
--
the
vermont
yankee
license
has
been
remanded
handing
the
commissions
take
a
serious
look
at
the
waste
disposal
issues.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
there
is
no
question
about
that,
there
is
no
issue
about
that
at
all,
but
because
of
the
commission's
reversal
of
position,
it's
decision
that
waste
disposal
issues
were
valid
issues
to
be
considered
and
its
subsequent
proceedings,
two
separate
cases
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
essentially
the
same
general
issues,
and
the
one
which
you
have
accepted
cert
on
is
the
one
that
involves
vermont
yankee's
license.
there
was
also
a
petition
as
you
probably
recall
for
review
of
the
court's
decision
as
to
the
commission's
rule
making.
that
petition
was
not
granted.
so
the
issue
before
you
here
is
whether
vermont
yankee
was
properly
or
improperly
granted
that
license,
and
it
is
related
to
the
rule
making
only
and
so
far
as
the
vermont
yankee's
license
now
depends
on
the
outcome
of
rule
making.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
vermont
yankee's
license
was
held
invalid
because
the
commission
gave
no
consideration
whatever
to
the
environmental
impact
of
the
waste
that
would
be
produced
at
that
plant.
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
the
commission
had
agreed
that
that
was
an
error,
that
it
was
supposed
to
look
at
the
waste
issues,
the
waste
that
arose
from
that
plant.
if
i
had
to
look
at
what
the
environmental
impact
of
those
would
be,
however,
in
effect,
it
simply
said
we
won't
relook
at
any
plants
that
we
looked
at
before.
case
however
had
already
been
filed
as
to
vermont
yankee.
indeed
it
was
filing
of
that
case
which
referred
the
commission
to
change
its
position.
so
that,
that
case
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
license
could
be
issued
to
a
plant
with
no
consideration
whatever
given
to
the
environmental
impact
of
the
waste
that
plant
would
produce.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no,
they
were
separate
and
unrelated
until
they
came
before
the
court
at
the
same
time.
the
vermont
yankee
case
poses
the
issue
of
whether
a
plant
can
be
licensed
with
no
consideration
whatever
of
the
environmental
impact
of
waste
that
plant
will
produce.
the
rulemaking
proceeding
is
one
in
which
the
commission
agreed,
that
that
position
is
narrow,
it
agreed
that
it
had
to
look
at
the
environmental
effects
of
waste.
if
then
however,
conducted
what
we
consider
to
be
an
extremely
cursory
examination
of
the
issue
and
we
then
appealed
that
rulemaking
to
the
court
of
appeals.
court
of
appeals
decided
both
cases
together.
it
held
in
the
first
instance
that
licensing
a
plant
with
no
consideration
of
waste
was
clearly
a
violation
of
nepa,
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
it
also
held
that
the
commission's
rulemaking
had
not
provided
an
adequate
investigation,
laying
out
on
the
public
record
of
the
environmental
hazards
associated
with
reprocessing
and
spent
nuclear
fuel
and
with
the
ultimate
disposal
of
the
waste
that
it
produce
at
the
power
plant.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no,
the
rulemaking
proceedings
was
conducted
completely
separately
from
the
vermont
yankee
proceeding.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that
i
think
the
commission's
present
position
is
stated
in
the
opinion
which
i
provided
to
you
last
week
which
grants
vermont
yankee
its
license
based
on
this
interim
rule,
but
clearly
indicates
also
that
the
commission's
view
is
that
vermont
yankee
is
grandfather
and
as
i
said
my
client
is
not
concerned
that
that
should
occur.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
am
sorry!
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that's
right,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
vermont
yankee
license
must
be
remanded
pending
an
adequate
investigation
and
then
lying
out
on
the
public
record
of
the
waste
issues.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
let's
be
clear,
there
are
two
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
--
there
are
two
decisions.
if
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
in
the
vermont
yankee
case,
which
is
that's
before
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes
that
decision
could
be
made
and
--
essentially
on
grandfather
grounds.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that's
correct.
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
about
that
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
have
no
objection
to
vermont
yankee
is
having
a
license.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
we
have
great
deal
of
objection
to
your
reversal.[attempt
to
laughter]
we
see
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
commission
has
properly
examined
the
waste
issues
under
the
national
environmental
policy.
i
can
point
out
that
the
court
saw
it
that
way
also.
the
court
said
that
we
don't
presume
to
tell
you
what
procedure
should
be
used.
we
are
not
preserving
to
tell
you
whether
the
procedure
should
be
rule
making
or
adjudication
but
we
do
preserve
to
tell
you
tell
you
that
based
on
what
we
see
here
(a)
a
case
in
which
applying
for
license
was
no
consideration
and
b
a
rule
making
in
which
the
commission
essentially
give
no
consideration
to
the
basic
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
most
of
the
major
non
nuclear
regulatory
commission
people
who
have
looked
at
this
issue.
we
cannot
agree
that
that's
what
adequate
consideration
these
issues
under
â€“
under
the
national
environment
policy.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
there
are
two
basic
issues;
one
is
that
it
had
been
assumed
that
â€“
that
the
fuel,
the
spent
fuel
from
nuclear
reactors
would
be
reprocessed
and
plutonium
would
be
extracted
from
that
fuel
to
be
used
in
turn
as
fuel
for
future
reactors.
recently
a
major
ford
foundation
study
as
one
example
criticized
that
decision
because
of
the
fear
that
one
plutonium
is
purified
it
is
â€“
it
is
easy
to
steal,
to
divert
either
by
technologically
backward
nation
or
by
a
terrorist
group
and
the
technology
to
produce
a
crude
bomb
is
widely
known,
can
easily
be
done.
the
president
of
united
states,
last
spring,
based
on
thought
--
on
that
reason
decided
that
reprocessing
shouldn't
go
forward.
the
second
issue
is
the
disposal
of
the
waste
themselves.
the
waste
themselves
include
elements
which
are
radioactive
for
periods
ranging
from
100
of
years
to
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years,
so
the
issue
of
how
to
isolate
those
wastes
from
all
life
human
and
â€“
and
otherwise
for
periods
that
range
anywhere
from
thousand
years
to
quarter
of
million
years,
there
have
been
studies
published
in
the
last
two
three
years
by
massachusetts
institute
of
technology,
caltech,
british
royal
commission,
general
accounting
office
and
a
house
committee
all
of
which
conclude
that
the
commission
has
failed
to
solve
that
problem,
failed
to
demonstrate
any
means
for
isolating
nuclear
waste
from
the
environment.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well
no
such
temporary
storage
is
occurring
either,
your
honor.
what
is
actually
occurring
is
that
because
there
is
no
solution
temporary,
100-year
or
a
long
term
which
has
been
demonstrated
at
this
point
the
spent
reactor
fuel
is
being
stored
in
fuel
holds
on
the
site
of
the
reactor
which
were
designed
to
hold
the
fuel
for
a
matter
of
twp
or
three
months
before
it
was
shipped
off
to
be
taken
care
of.
this
is
a
problem
which
is
been
considered
to
by
everyone
but
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
as
perhaps
the
critical
problem
considering
whether
nuclear
power
should
be
perused.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well
the
commission's
view
is
that
they
can
look
because
this
issue
occurs
in
every
plant,
they
will
look
at
the
issue
once
generically.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
--
which
incorporates
a
table
of
figures
essentially,
yes.
the
point
is
thought
that
two
things
are
done
by
that,
one
by
convening
a
rule
making
proceeding
like
the
agency
has
curtailed
the
usual
procedural
rights
that
occur
--
that
are
given
to
interveners
on
safety
issues
on
national
environmental
issues
in
the
usual
licensing
of
the
plant.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
the
commission
prepares
an
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well
that
i'll
say
that
--
the
commission
ordinarily
prepares
an
environmental
impact
statement
for
each
plant.
that
environmental
impact
statement
is
then
taken
into
account
in
the
licensing
and
during
that
proceeding
any
party
of
the
proceeding
is
afforded
usual
full
panel
plea
of
adjudicatory
rights,
cross-examination
and
so
forth
as
to
the
environmental
impact
statement
and
the
statements
that
were
made
there
as
well
as
to
the
safety
issue.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
commission
is
--
in
conveying
generic
rule
making
proceeding
they
have
restricted
those
rights.
i
do
think
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
requires
that
the
commission
explore
the
issues,
whether
it
be
by
that
kind
of
procedure
or
not,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yeah.
oh!
i
think
the
rule
making
that
was
given
here
clearly
was
not
open
enough
to
explore
the
issues.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
pages
of
the
record
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
your
honor
that's
not
the
proposition
that
i
would
support.
the
proposition
that
i
would
supporter
is
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
requires
the
agency
to
explore
in
the
public
record
fully
environmental
impact
of
a
proposed
action.
this
rule
making
was
taken
in
fact
to
prepare
a
part
of
the
environment
impact
statement
for
every
power
plant
to
be
licensed
from
then
on.
so
it
was
subject
to
the
same
injunction
which
this
court
has
stated
and
many
lower
courts
have
too
that
there
must
be
a
full
analysis.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
i
think
it's
been
stated
in
the
kleppe
case
as
well
as
the
other
napa
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
that
the
kleppe
case
is
sufficient.
i
think
the
critical
point
about
the
lower
court's
decision
is
that
it
is
focusing
on
whether
there
was
an
adequate
exploration
of
the
issues
to
meet
the
standards
of
napa,
not
the
meet
the
standards
of
the
apa.
apa
is
involved
here
and
we
think
that
those
standards
working
that
either,
but
the
key
thing
is
that
the
duty
of
the
commission
came
as
a
result
of
national
environmental
policy
act
which
requires
that
there
be
a
full
exploration
of
the
issues,
that's
one
of
the
reason
why
we're
saying
--
why
we
feel
the
court's
decision
was
not
a
procedural
decision.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
i
have
a
different
view
on
what's
--
what
the
nepa
statement's
position
is
than
that
suggests.
i
think
a
nepa
statement
proceeding
particularly
one
that
involves
essentially
nepa
statements
for
all
future
nuclear
power
licensing
requires
very
thorough
exploration
of
the
issues
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
that's
in
the
case
law
of
nepa.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
this
court
and
the
lower
courts.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
so
yes.
scrap
--
i
think
the
courts
--
the
lower
court's
position
clearly
was
that
it
was
not
concerned
about
procedure,
but
what
it
was
concerned
about
was
the
fact
that
the
procedures
that
had
been
used
and
the
way
that
were
used
failed
to
produce
an
exploration
of
the
issues.
what
the
commission
basically
did
was
to
look
at
the
hypothetical
normal
operation
without
any
accidents
or
any
other
abnormal
occurrences
of
a
hypothetical
reprocessing
scheme
and
disposal
scheme
and
did
fail
to
consider
altogether
for
long-term
future
of
attempting
to
isolate
the
waste
and
it
failed
also
to
consider
the
possibility
that
something
might
go
wrong.
for
example
in
the
case
of
reprocessing
that
a
terrorist
group
or
a
foreign
power
might
wish
to
divert
the
small
quantity
of
plutonium
that
was
necessary
to
make
a
weapon.
there
is
a
basic
conflict
here
between
the
way
the
commission
has
tried
to
deal
with
this
issue
as
if
it
were
kind
of
minor
concern
and
the
way
the
rest
of
the
world
outside
the
commission
views
it
as
one
of
the
most
important
issues
of
concern
about
the
whole
commitment
of
the
nation
to
nuclear
power.
and
like
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
fact
was
saying
to
the
commission,
you
must
honestly
and
above
board
and
fully
explore
the
issue
with
the
public
and
let
the
public
know
including
its
decision-makers,
what
problems
do
exist
with
nuclear
waste
so
that
a
decision
can
be
made
about
them.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
divine
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
address
the
kind
of
major
concerns
which
the
petitioners
â€“
i
am
sorry
the
respondents
and
others
raised
to
them
in
the
rule
making
and
the
commission
essentially
failed
to
address
them.
and
those
are
in
fact
the
same
concerns
that
i
have
mentioned,
expert
bodies
outside
the
commission
have
raised
also
repeatedly
in
the
last
few
years
of
serious
problems.
we
think
the
commission
in
fact
has
tried
to
sweep
those
concerns
under
the
rug
and
avoid
the
discussion
which
nepa
really
is
aimed
at
producing
so
as
to
produce
better
federal
policies.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
don't
know
whether
it's
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
am
not
sure
whether
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well
i
think
yes,
the
notion
certainly
is
that
the
alternative
means
of
dealing
with
the
problem
need
to
be
explored
and
they
are,
clearly
many
of
them
are
as
the
commission
admits
are
not
yet
seen
in
full
because
they
are
still
hypothetical.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
engage
in
some
of
sort
of
crystal
bowl
examination,
but
we
are
suggesting
the
outlines
of
the
potential
environmental
risks
involved
in
each
of
those
alternatives
is
reasonably
clear
and
can
be
laid
out
on
the
record.
what
the
commission
did
here
was
to
consider
only
one
hypothetical
short-term
solution
to
its
problem,
no
long-term
solutions
at
all.
there
was
no
discussion
essentially
of
the
dangers
that
might
flow
from
one
alternative
as
opposed
to
another.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
think
--
yes
the
act
does
ask
specifically
that
alternatives
be
explored
and
also
that
the
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
to
evaluate
â€“
well
there
is
case
law
on
the
question
of
to
what
extent
â€“
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
i
am.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
records
you
will
see
that's
correct.
there
is
not
even
one
alternative
given
as
to
long-term
storage,
not
one
let
alone,
alternatives
to
that
one.
there
is
one
hypothetical
which
is
no
longer
the
commission's
policy
to
pursue
given
for
so
called
short-terms
storage.
that's
the
reason
why
i
think
court
didn't
need
the
help
of
experts
to
divine
that
the
record
in
this
case
was
insufficient
to
support
the
conclusion
of
the
effects
of
wastes
were
insignificant.
i
see
my
light
is
on,
i
thank
you
very
much.
