justice
potter
stewart
now
before
you
proceed
mr.
dignan,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
the
respondents
say
in
their
supplemental
statement
of
facts
that
your
client
vermont
yankee
has
now
been
granted
an
operating
license,
and
at
the
time
to
seek
review
of
that
license
has
expired
without
petition
for
review
being
filed,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
you
came
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
you
had
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
you
have
a
license.
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
the
end
of
18
months?
justice
potter
stewart
by
exceeded
you
mean
there
was
more
than
adequate
complaince.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
say
was
the
court
of
appeals'
view?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
concede,
would
you
not
mr.
dignan
that
there's
some
ambiguity
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
concurring.
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
have
sufficient
ventilation
and
sufficient
dialogue.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
certainly
think
it's
the
agency's
job
to
construct
it
i
gather
rather
then
a
court.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
agency
broke
the
law
by
going
through
the
procedures
it
went
through
here
for
the
rule
making.
no
i
think
the
agency
complied
fully
with
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah
well
it
-–
more
then
that
it
went
farther
you
say.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
horsky,
somewhere
along
the
line
of
these
procedures
wasn't
the
point
made
that
one
of
the
customers,
dow
chemical
would
no
longer
need
the
power
to
be
supplied
by
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
chronologically
when
was
that
done,
by
the
same
time
it
considered
these
17
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
that
supplemental
statement
of
facts,
you
state
that
the
vermont
yankee
nuclear
power
station
has
now
been
granted
a
full
term
operating
license.
now
your
brother
says
that
it
was
in
effect
in
18
months.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
which
has
been
18
months
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
did
come
to
the
same
conclusion
for
a
40
year
license
pack
in
1973.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
all
the
vermont
yankee
wanted
and
they
have
got
it,
if
they
do
have
a
40
year
license,
but
the
fact
is
they
have
a
license
under
the
interim
rule
which
is
an
18
months
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
proceedings
of
the
rule
making
and
not
the
licensing.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
if
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
vermont
yankee
would
have
the
license
that
it
was
given
in
1973
–
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
years.
justice
potter
stewart
and
vermont
yankee
has
its
license
that
it
was
given
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
these
issues
are
the
--
what
the
environmental
effect
of
the
so
called
backend
part
of
the
nuclear
cycle?
justice
potter
stewart
and
commission
what's
happening
so
far
is
that
a
so
called
temporary
storage
of
a
100
years.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
issue
is
--
that's
all
a
matter
of
under
the
law
of
separate
and
subsequent
licensing?
justice
potter
stewart
make
a
rule
and
produce
which
--
which
incorporates
a
curve,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
are
talking
about
us,
you
are
talking
about
the
non
federal
respondents
in
76-528?
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
nelson
isham
is
a
person,
a
businessman
or
is
somebody
who
lives
in
the
area.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
others
are
various
environmental
groups
