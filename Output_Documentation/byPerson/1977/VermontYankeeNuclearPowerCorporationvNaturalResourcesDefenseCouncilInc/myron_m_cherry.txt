mr.
myron
m.
cherry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
short-time
remaining
and
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
in
70,
the
respondents
in
76-528
expect
for
the
federal
respondents,
i
would
like
to
state
that
i
would
like
to
rely
on
mr.
ayres'
argument
with
respect
to
the
fuel
cycle
although
i
would
just
like
to
place
on
the
record
the
notion
that
mr.
justice
steven
suggested,
perhaps
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted
in
event
that
there
is
now
a
moving
target
and
concern
of
the
interim
license
with
respect
of
the
fuel
cycle.
with
respect
to
the
issues
in
the
aeschliman
case,
our
position
is
quite
clear
and
quite
direct.
we
properly
appeared
before
the
agency,
acknowledged
our
presence
and
placed
improper
legal
barriers
in
our
way.
the
commission
was
perfectly
willing
to
have
us
be
present.
when
we
asked
for
participation,
we
were
told
that
the
issues
we
were
concerned
about
were
either
beyond
the
scope
of
nepa
or
would
not
considered.
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
that
is
correct.
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
that
involves
two
cases
mr.
justice.
in
one
of
the
cases
before
involves
some
citizen
groups
known
as
the
saginaw
valley
nuclear
study
group,
includes
the
international
environmental
law
committee
of
the
united
auto
workers,
includes
the
university
of
michigan
environmental
law
society,
the
west
michigan
environmental
action
council
and
then
it
was
consolidated
with
the
so-called
aeschliman
petitioners
which
were
people
who
lived
in
the
area
near
the
plant
and
owner
of
a
motel,
the
saginaw
interveners
essentially
took
the
laboring
or
both
of
the
hearings
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
consolidated
both
of
those
cases
for
decision
and
for
argument.
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
he
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
pardon
me
he
is
a
man
who
lives
in
the
area
and
who
i
believe
owns
a
motel
–
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well
the
citizen
groups
mr.
justice
involved
not
only
people
who
live
in
the
community
and
are
very
concerned
about
development
of
that
particular
community
who,
many
of
them
work
for
dow
chemical,
but
they
also
comprise
local
representatives
of
national
organizations
along
with
the
sierra
club.
i
think
a
point
to
be
taken
is
that
whatever
the
court
does
with
respect
to
the
fuel
cycle
case,
it
really
has
no
impact
upon
the
aeschliman
case.
while
the
fuel
cycle
issue
was
one
of
the
four
issues
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
acrs
issue,
the
energy
conservation
and
the
dow
cost-benefit
analysis,
the
fuel
cycle
issue
was
given
a
sentence
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
below
by
sucking
in
by
reference
to
fuel
cycle
and
while
we
believe
that
the
fuel
cycle
has
some
importance
to
the
overall
administration
and
regulation
of
the
nuclear
energy,
it
has
no
impact
upon
the
case
that
was
consolidated.
indeed
there
is
some
question
in
our
minds
given
the
fact
the
government
opposed
the
writ
of
certiorari
even
if
the
court
took
the
cert
cases
and
still
treats
in
its
briefs
the
issue
secondary,
whether
this
court
not
having
advised
about
what
is
before
the
court,
whether
those
issues
are
even
before
the
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
ought
to
take
a
long
hard
look
before
it
gets
involved
in
a
record
kind
of
case
like
the
aeschliman.
but
in
connection
with
a
couple
of
points
made
by
consumer
powers
council,
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
up;
first
of
all
it
is
not
true
that
the
dow
issue
is
essentially
quiescent.
once
again
we
have
a
moving
target
with
respect
to
these
issues.
we
have
gone
through
a
year
of
remanded
hearings.
there
are
new
facts
before
the
commission
now
and
assuming
hypothetically
that
this
court
does
choose
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
aeschliman,
those
facts
are
still
before
the
commission.
the
commission
under
10
cfr
50.100,
its
general
superintendent
power,
cannot
ignore
facts
and
is
proceeding
forward
with
that
case
and
so
once
again
there
is
a
fresh
record
that
may
wind
its
way
through
the
appeal
process
in
the
court
of
appeals,
because
we
are
now
dealing
with
those
issues.
but
in
connection
with
the
dow
issue
specifically
there
was
a
decision
by
the
licensing
board
on
remand
just
september
of
this
year
where
licensing
board
of
the
commission
said
“while
dow
need
steam
dow
does
not
necessarily
need
it
for
midland
and
whether
dow
will
ever
buy
steam
from
that
plant
is
on
this
record
speculative.
whether
the
circumstances
will
change
by
the
time
the
remanding
hearing
is
concluded
is
impossible
to
know,”
and
it
goes
on
and
suggested
if
dow
fails
to
buy
steam,
the
circumstances
will
be
one
of
a
plant
at
a
site
for
which
only
very
limited
alternatives
were
explored.
what
has
occurred
in
the
process
is
that
consumers
ran
out
of
money
in
the
74/75
period,
the
amount
of
funds
they
have
spent
now
is
barely
i
think
20/22%
of
the
total
amount
and
the
remanded
hearing
is
which
this
court
would
interrupt
by
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
all
but
over.
i
would
contemplate
those
remanded
hearing
might
not
last
more
than
six
months
from
when
they
begin
and
they
are
scheduled
to
begin
as
soon
as
the
appeal
board
rules
on
the
interim
relationship.
so
--
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
how
much
of
what
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well,
we
have
--
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well,
it
is
not
before
you
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
sense
that
you
are
being
asked
to
look
at
that
record.
however,
it
is
before
you
in
the
sense
that
we
believe
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
in
our
answering
brief
to
update
the
record
and
indicate
that
the
commission
has
moved
forward
to
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals'
order
and
that
task
is
all
but
over
with
and
i'm
only
suggesting
with
all
due
respect
that
process
ought
to
go
forward
because
it
involves
important
issues
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission's
functions
which
it
now
all
but
acknowledges.
in
connection
with
the
argument
made
about
our
neither
raising
energy
conservation
issues
where
the
acrs
being
unimportant,
i
think
it
also
important
to
understand
that
the
position
of
the
government
and
of
the
utility
in
this
case
has
constantly
been
changing,
for
example
on
energy
conservation.
in
1972
the
licensing
board
said
that
the
contentions
we
wanted
to
raise
will
be
on
their
province.
that
ruling
came
that's
why
we
didn't
participate
in
the
hearing
because
we
were
told
we
couldn't
deal
with
those
issues.
in
1973
the
appeal
board
said
that
our
contentions
are
well
beyond
the
pail
of
nepa.
now
as
of
1972,
president
nixon
already
submitted
to
congress
a
comprehensive
energy
policy.
chairman
dob
or
commissioner
dob
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
in
specific
answers
to
the
joint
committee
had
dealt
with
the
question
of
energy
conservation.
chairman
schlesinger
had
given
a
speech
saying
it
was
a
legitimate
issue.
so
the
suggestion
that
the
commission
was
not
aware
of
energy
conservation
as
an
alternative
is
really
legal
top
security
and
it's
barring
of
the
issues
below
is
no
more
than
trickery
because
the
commission
was
aware
that
the
regulatory
staff
moved
very
quickly
below
in
the
record
before
it
sit
out
and
consumers
obliviously
made
the
same
issue.
in
1974
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
commission
below
decided
to
change
what
their
position
was
and
why
they
barred
energy
conservation.
they
abandoned
the
beyond
the
pale
nepa
argument
because
it
was
unsupportable
and
i
think
the
government's
brief
admits
that
and
says
for
the
first
time
that
we
didn't
raise
our
contention
specifically.
now
stopping
right
there,
you
have
an
agency
which
says
that
your
contentions
weren't
specific,
that
i
didn't
understand
what
energy
conservation
was,
that
it
was
beyond
the
pail
of
nepa,
that
it
was
involving
concept.
well
it
can't
be
all
of
those
things.
if
we
are
told
that
energy
conservation
needed
to
be
more
specific
under
the
agency
argument
that
they
didn't
know
what
was
in
the
first
place.
i
submit
that
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case
is
really
quite
important
from
another
circumstance.
it
has
carved
out
special
rule
for
the
midland
case.
now
whether
the
midland
case
ought
to
be
built,
whether
it
ought
to
be
built
is
not
before
this
court.
we
are
not
here
to
suggest
that
it
is
the
proper
or
improper
plant
necessarily
in
midland.
my
client
has
spent
an
awful
lot
of
time
and
money
for
the
sole
principle
of
merely
trying
to
be
heard.
it
is
not
a
case
of
fuel
cycle
where
we
are
arguing
that
the
commission
may
or
may
not
have
adequately
had
the
record.
we
were
told
we
couldn't
deal
with
these
issues.
in
terms
of
the
acrs
issue
once
again
my
brothers
treat
the
issue
as
one
of
just
--
it's
in
advisory
committee.
we
look
at
it
this
way
and
we
hope
the
court
will
if
it
decides
to
reach
the
question.
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
has
a
letter.
the
letter
is
of
some
importance.
it
was
before
this
court
in
similar
way
in
the
power
reactor
case
where
this
court
recognized
that
the
advisory
committee
and
reactor
safeguards
was
important
and
if
the
court's
repose
in
that
situation
what
the
commission
was
trying
to
do
was
to
hide
the
fact,
to
hide
the
fact
the
advisory
committee
was
against
it.
in
our
situation
we
held
a
letter
which
said
there
are
other
problems
unidentified
which
should
apply
to
the
midland
case.
now
i
asked
questions
about
what
those
other
questions
were,
how
should
they
be
applied,
what
due
consideration
is,
we
were
told
that
acrs
was
collegiate
--
collegial
in
nature
and
we
couldn't
ask
any
questions.
the
letter
was
putting
for
the
truths
--
for
the
purpose
of
proving
the
acrs
made
a
review
but
than
with
catch-22
notion
that
it
wasn't
in
for
the
proof
of
matters
there.
now
assuming
for
the
moment
on
the
basis
of
this
record
--
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
yes,
i
did
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
power
reactor
case,
the
commission
in
argument
before
this
court
stated
that
the
acrs
was
an
important
body
and
it
might
very
well
be
witness
in
various
proceedings.
it
was
with
that
authority
that
we
moved
to
depose
the
acrs
and
to
ask
them
question
to
bottom.
but
our
request
was
born
out
of
frustration.
we
couldn't
touch
the
letter.
the
letter
could
have
be
in
the
new
york
times
or
the
washington
post
for
all
that
it
matter
as
long
as
it
had
the
logo
acrs
with
the
proper
signature
it
went
into
the
record.
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well,
we
believe
that
congress
intended
much
more
than
that.
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
been
trying
to
abolish
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safe
guards
for
some
time
now.
it
goes
to
congress
each
time
it's
told
no.
the
legislative
history
which
we
have
set
out
in
depth
in
our
brief
suggests
that
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
check
on
the
commission
and
the
fundamental
reason
for
it
was
that
the
letters
ought
to
be
public
and
that
they
ought
to
be
spread
of
record,
because
after
all
with
the
hearing
process'
concern
it's
the
joint
--
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
what
was
made
public
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
the
bold
statement
that
the
plant
could
satisfactorily
resolve
given
due
consideration
other
problems.
the
other
problems
weren't
set
forth,
they
were
not
identified,
the
due
consideration
wasn't
spelled
out
and
myself
--
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well,
yes
that
is
true.
what
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
below
is
the
content
of
letter.
mr.
myron
m.
cherry
well
we
believe
that
congress
focused
on
the
suggestion
that
the
acrs
come
to
the
public
hearing
and
explain
what
it's
position
is.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
the
commission's
position
in
the
power
reactor
case.
it's
only
been
recently
when
the
advisory
committee
has
begun
to
disagree
with
the
regulatory
staff
that
the
regulatory
staff
has
attempted
through
–
with
the
aid
of
licensing
board
to
prevent
examination
of
these
records.
in
that
sense
aeschliman
case
is
quite
unremarkable
and
what
i
would
like
to
impress
upon
this
court
is
that
what
essentially
our
argument
is,
is
that
a
plant
is
in
the
process
of
being
constructed
now,
where
no
one
ever
agrees
now
that
it's
analysis
were
ever
analyzed.
dow
chemical
is
no
longer
seriously
interested
in
this
plant.
it
testified
on
the
remanded
hearings
for
the
purposes
of
advising
the
court
that
if
it
could
walk
away
from
the
plant
today
it
would.
it
testified
it
had
no
confidence
in
either
utility
in
terms
of
it's
timing
etc.
our
position
is
only
that
we
are
interested
in
a
hearing.
this
court
has
been
–
in
its
protection
of
that
one
solid
point,
the
people
who
come
prepare
to
participate
in
the
judicial
process
are
entitled
to
be
heard
in
the
administrative
process.
that
singular
principle
of
law
is
the
fundamental
position
of
our
country
and
of
the
basis
of
due
process
of
the
long
line
of
this
court's
decisions,
that's
all
we
asked
below
and
that's
all
we
ask
here
before
this
court.
and
what
is
important
in
terms
of
the
agreement
proceeding
is
for
these
alternatives
to
be
explored.
now
in
the
brief
of
consumer's
power
before
the
court
there
is
a
suggestion
made
which
i
am
sure
is
not
pressed
very
strongly
but
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
about
it
anyway.
the
argument
starts
out
that
we
spent
$325
million
on
a
plant
with
obviously
the
tag
end
line
that
this
involves
substantial
amount
of
money
and
the
court
ought
to
be
aware
of
it.
we
would
like
to
deal
with
that
issue
kind
of
expressly.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
lot
in
the
record
as
to
whether
this
money
is
recoverable,
whether
those
were
honest
amounts,
but
let's
just
–
and
i
might
also
point
of
the
amount
of
the
plant
originally
conceived
that
around
500
million
is
up
to
almost
2
billion
dollars.
so,
the
amounts
while
perhaps
large
are
not
in
terms
of
the
total
amount
of
the
plant,
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
suggest
in
terms
of
the
commission's
foreclosure
argument
is
really
the
same
kind
of
argument
being
implicitly
made
by
the
suggestion
that
lot
of
money
was
spent.
the
idea
that
any
amount
of
money
can
substantially
provide
a
legal
basis
for
a
bankrupt
decision
is
certainly
impermissible.
and
when
we
finally
reach
the
supreme
court
or
if
those
issues
are
not
properly
before
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
everything
we
could
to
get
before
that
court
and
if
we
are
told
that
that
point
in
time
some
three
or
four
years
later
that
the
issues
were
important,
they
should
have
been
ventilated
and
yet
then
we
are
told
that
the
amount
of
money
having
been
spent
is
important,
regulation
then
amounts
to
having
someone
purchase
a
legal
opinion
from
a
reputable
lawyer,
saying
that
he
has
in
good
faith
relied
upon
this
and
then
proceed
to
implement
the
regulation.
and
that's
what
really
this
case
is
all
about
because
if
this
case
is
reversed
in
terms
of
the
aeschliman
issues,
talk
about
judicial
intervention
running
riot
we
are
going
to
have
no
federal
agency
who
will
be
able
to
regulate,
because
apa's
regulations,
the
ftc's
regulations,
the
icc's
regulations,
every
administrative
agency
which
has
to
rely
on
importance
of
finality
will
surely
be
turned
around.
we
submit
that
the
issues
of
energy
conservation
are
not
only
important
to
the
country
today,
but
they
were
important
in
1970
and
there
is
no
basis
for
the
suggestion
that
the
supreme
court
can
reply
upon
a
record
this
case
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
did
not
become
aware
of
that.
thank
you
very
much.
