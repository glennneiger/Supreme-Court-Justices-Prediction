mr.
charles
a.
horsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
number
528
consumers
power
company.
this
is
a
challenge
to
a
construction
license
rather
than
an
operating
license.
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case
they
incorporated
by
reference,
their
decision
in
the
vermont
yankee
case,
and
for
that
reason
i
joined
in
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
dignan
and
mr.
wallace
in
urging
a
reversal
of
that
decision,
but
on
that
issue
i
would
prefer
to
rest
what
has
been
said
and
go
on
to
the
other
two
issues
which
were
involved
in
the
midland
case.
those
two
issues
involved
two
separate
grounds
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
fuel
cycle
issue.
the
first
is
whether
the
commission,
whether
the
licensing
board
in
granting
the
construction
license,
adequately
dealt
with
what
i
might
shorter-hand
call
conservation
of
energy
alternatives
to
the
grant
of
the
construction
license.
the
other
is
whether
the
report
of
the
advisory
committee
on
nuclear
safeguards
which
is
one
of
the
statutory
requirements,
where
the
hearing
and
grant
of
a
license
was
adequate.
let
me
take
them
up
in
turn.
first,
with
respect
to
the
so-called
energy
conservation
issue,
it's
a
(inaudible)
issue,
did
the
licensing
board
properly
consider
the
alternative
to
the
plan
of
energy
conservation.
we
submit
that
it
did.
the
procedures
started
with
an
environmental
impact
statement
which
covered
all
of
the
various
categories,
all
of
the
various
considerations
and
attached
to
it
for
circulation
and
ultimate
hearing,
where
some
119
energy
or
environmental
considerations
propounded
by
an
intervener
which
called
saginaw,
that
draft
environmental
impact
statement
report
was
then
the
subject
of
hearings,
adjudicatory
hearings,
cross-examination,
preceded
by
discovery
and
all
the
rest,
where
it
lasted
for
14
days.
it's
perhaps
worth
noting
that
the
saginaw
intervener
who
propounded
the
considerations
failed
to
participate
in
those
hearings,
but
those
hearings
developed
in
detail,
the
need
for
the
project,
a
conclusion
which
was
supported
by
the
michigan
public
service
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
and
environmental
protection
agency.
the
controversy
relates
to
some
17
of
these
119
environmental
contentions
propounded
by
saginaw,
which
are
said
to
be
all
over,
the
words
are
not
used,
energy
conservation
contentions.
some
of
them
were
dealt
with
by
the
licensing
board
specifically,
for
example,
it
considered
and
found
that
there
was
no
basis
for
holding
that
the
consumers
power
had
artificially
enhanced
the
requirements
for
electricity
and
therefore
distorted
its
demand
figures.
the
licensing
board
did
decline
however
to
consider
a
number
of
saginaw
somewhat
rhetorical
contentions
in
dealing
with
general,
whether
or
not
it
would
be
proper
to
set
limits
on
the
uses
of
electricity
whereas
the
licensing
board
put
it
whether
we
should
consider
whether
the
present
customer
uses
of
electricity
in
our
society
are
proper
or
improper.
the
appeal
board
affirmed
that
decision
but
that
wasn't
the
end
of
it.
while
the
petition
for
review
was
pending
in
the
court
below,
the
interveners
asked
that
the
hearing
before
the
licensing
board
be
reopened
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
in
the
meantime
in
a
decision
called
an
niagara
power
decision
had
said
things
which
were
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
the
licensing
board.
that
motion
to
reopen
the
hearings
was
passed
upon,
ruled
upon
by
the
commission
itself
in
a
long
careful
opinion.
in
that
opinion,
it
reviewed
each
of
these
17
contentions,
and
set
forth
in
careful,
study
words
why
believe
the
licensing
board
was
correct
in
not
having
to
consider
the
contentions
which
were
urged
with
respect
to
energy
conservation
which
the
licensing
board
did
not
consider.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
there
is--
well,
at
one
point
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
a
motion
was
made
to
reopen
the
hearing
on
the
ground
that
the
contract
arrangements
between
dow
and
consumers
had
been
modified.
the
commission
heard
that
decision
or
heard
that
contention
and
reviewed
the
contracts
and
said
that
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
the
decision
should
be
changed
and
so
far
as
dow
was
concerned.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
all
i
can
say
is
that
since
that
time,
there
have
been
no
substantial
changes
in
the
dow
consumer
relationship.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
said,
you
might
relook
at
those
questions,
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
situation
with
respect
to
dow
is
essentially
the
same
as
it
has
been
since
the
time,
the
commission
itself
re-examined
the
issue
and
decided
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
modification
of
its
decision.
i
think
that
dow
question
can
be
put
to
one
side
your
honor.
what
is
clear
in
this
record,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
there
is
a
need
--
a
clearly
demonstrated
need
for
the
power,
that
this
plant
is
to
generate
and
it
also
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
was
quite
correct
in
saying
the
licensing
board
did
not
need
to
consider
the
kind
of
contentions
for
example,
and
i
quote
the
possibility
of
changing
the
present
social
stimuli
to
society
which
could
result
in
a
decreased
demand
for
electricity
or
another
one,
that
dow
chemical
should
be
denied
electricity
in
order
that
it
would
be
encouraged
to
develop
power
sources
and
i
quote
again,
from
other
sources
not
on
demand.
i
think
the
board
was
correct
in
saying
that
if
those
kinds
of
contentions
did
not
require
the
licensing
board
to
go
into
them
in
detail.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
board
didn't
have
a
responsibility
for
determining
that
there
was
a
need
for
the
power
to
be
generated,
of
course
it
did,
and
it
went
into
that
in
great
detail
examining
the
demand
statistics
which
were
presented
in
very
detail
to
it.
what
it
is
to
say
is
that
under
nepa,
commission
it
seems
to
me
was
entirely
warranted
in
saying
that
the
interveners
who
were
challenging
the
demand
and
suggesting
an
alternative
to
the
plant
had
the
responsibility
for
developing
something
more
specific
than
what
the
kinds
of
things
i've
just
suggested,
with
reasonably
specific
conservation
measures
which
as
the
commission
put
it,
would
require
reasonable
minds
to
inquire
further.
that's
the
character
--
that's
the
threshold
test
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
so
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
anything
but
that
and
let
me
mention
again
what
mr.
wallace
adverted
to
briefly
in
his
argument.
this
decision
was
made
in
1972,
this
decision
to
grant
the
construction
license.
at
that
time,
both
nepa
and
indeed
the
nation's
concern
for
proper
conservation
of
energy
were
certainly
in
a
developing
state,
in
a
different
state
than
they
are
today.
the
guidelines
set
out
by
the
council
on
environmental
quality
for
the
first
time
in
1973,
a
year
after
the
decision,
suggested
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
should
address
energy
conservation
alternatives.
the
federal
power
commission
in
1973,
for
the
first
time
suggested
that
in
consideration
of
a
license
for
a
hydroelectric
plant,
the
alternatives
of
conservation
ought
to
be
considered.
i
think
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
and
given
the
time
at
which
the
decision
was
rendered,
the
licensing
board
acted
properly
with
respect
to
these
energy
conservation
measures.
the
other
issue
is
--
as
i
say
in
the
brief
almost
a
contrived
one,
but
it
was
the
basis
of
a
further
order
by
the
court
below
that
we
go
back
to
the
licensing
board
again.
this
is
the
alleged
inadequacy
of
the
report
of
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards.
that
committee
is
a
15
member
part-time
group
of
distinguished
scientists
who
are
charged
by
the
statute
to
advise
the
commission
to
examine
and
to
advise
the
commission
on
the
preliminary
safety
analysis
report.
the
advisory
committee
did
in
fact
do
that.
it
filed
a
letter
with
the
commission,
pointing
out
certain
problems
which
they
thought
the
staff
should
address
and
then
it
said,
other
problems
involving
light
water
nuclear
reactors
are
set
forth
which
we
think
the
staff
should
address
are
set
forth
in
our
early
reports
on
light
water
nuclear
reactors.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
cross
reference
requires
that
this
case
be
remanded
because
the
licensing
board
should
have
sent
it
back
and
asked
the
advisory
committee
to
specify
the
other
factors
which
the
advisory
committee
said
the
staff
should
consider,
and
do
it
in
a
language
intelligible
to
a
layman
whatever
that
means
in
this
context.
these
other
reports
of
the
advisory
committee
were
of
course
known
to
the
commission
and
to
the
staff
and
incidentally,
if
there
is
any
question
about
whether
the
staff
was
confused,
the
reply
brief
filed
by
government,
i
think
clears
up
the
contention
that
the
staff
was
confused.
the
other
reports
were
filed
in
the
public
document
room
of
the
commission.
anyone
who
wanted
to
go
look
for
them,
could
have
gone
to
look
for
them.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
that
kind
of
a
mistake,
if
it
was
a
mistake
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
to
be
one.
it
was
a
customary
form
of
the
letter
of
the
advisory
committee,
doesn't
warrant
sending
this
case
back
to
square
one
which
is
where
we
will
be
before
the
licensing
board,
if
this
decision
stands.
that
we
think
is
just
judicial
interference
from
rights.
we
have
set
out,
i
think
it
is
relevant
in
our
brief
at
some
length
the
procedures
which
precede
the
issuance
of
a
construction
license
for
a
nuclear
plant.
the
application
by
the
applicant
is
an
enormous
document.
it's
reviewed
and
reviewed
and
reviewed
by
the
staff.
that's
the
first
step.
the
safety
aspects
are
considered
by
the
advisory
committee,
and
there's
a
full
adjudicatory
type
theory
on
the
safety
and
all
other
aspects
of
the
plant,
preceded
as
it
was
in
this
case
by
elaborate
discovery.
on
the
basis
of
that
record
the
licensing
board
makes
its
findings
and
it
spells
them
out
in
detail.
that
record
is
also
the
subject
of
what
amounts
to
a
de
novo
review
to
an
appeal
board.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
is
an
adjudicatory,
oh
yes,
full
adjudicatory
hearing,
full
discovery,
full
cross-examination
and
very
lengthy
and
the
decision
by
the
appeal
board
is
in
turn
subject
to
review
by
the
commission
itself
as
was
the
case
in
this
on
the
nepa
issue.
i
think
the
interveners
probably
would
like
it
otherwise
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
as
mr.
wallace
said,
decided
that
nuclear
power
should
be
used
for
electric
power
production.
it
did
so
in
the
atomic
energy
act,
it
reaffirmed
that
in
energy
reorganization
act
of
1974.
it
realized
that
it
presented
hazards
as
well
as
benefits,
but
it
went
ahead.
the
commission
has
been
equally
responsive
to
hazards
and
i
think
what's
developed
from
the
statutory
requirements
and
from
the
commission's
regulations
is
probably
the
most
elaborate,
the
most
detailed,
the
most
comprehensive
administrative
machinery
that
was
ever
devised
to
determine
whether
or
not
government
approval
or
disapproval
should
come
from
an
application
of
a
private
project.
what
the
court
below
has
done
in
these
two
cases
is
to
interject
itself
into
that
procedure.
it
sets
this
proceeding
back
nine
years.
this
application
was
filed
in
1969.
the
license
was
granted
in
1972,
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
go
back
to
licensing
board
for
further
hearings
and
we'll
be
through
the
appellate
process
the
appeal
board
all
the
rest
have
been
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
again.
we
had
a
valid
construction
license
until
the
court
of
appeals
acted.
we
hope
that
this
court
will
reverse
the
decision
below
and
give
us
our
construction
license
again.
thank
you.
