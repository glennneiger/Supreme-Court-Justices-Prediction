justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
what
is
the
position
of
the
government
as
to
whether
or
not
the
record
was
adequate
with
respect
to
vermont
yankee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
don't
you
have
to
take
a
position
in
order
to
tell
us
what
the
reverse
would
affirm?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
we
have
to
decide
the
case
though,
don't
we
either
have
to
affirm
or
reverse
and
if
agree
with
you
and
with
vermont
yankee
on
the
procedural
question,
don't
we
necessarily
have
either
to
decide
it
or
dismiss
the
writ
is
improperly
granted,
one
of
the
two,
i
mean,
we
have
to
act,
we
can't
just
it's
an
academic
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
if
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
you
won't
need
any
further
proceedings
in
the
vermont
yankee
case,
because
40
year
license
will
be
in
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
how
could
you
proceed
with
them
with
respect
to
vermont
yankee,
they
have
got
their
license,
won't
they
just
stay
home
and
not
come
to
your
hearings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
could
be
made
on
a
verity
of
different
--
in
any
event
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
reversed
in
the
vermont
yankee
case
then
vermont
yankee
has
the
license
that
was
originally
accorded.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
no
objection
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
you
have
no
objection
of
our
reversal
and
reinstating
the
vermont
yankee
license?
