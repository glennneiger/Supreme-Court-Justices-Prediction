justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dignan,
supposing
that
the
court
should
conclude
that
you're
right
on
the
procedural
issue
but
that
the
record
was
the
inadequate
on
the
question
waste
disposal,
what
should
the
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the
agency
has
done
anything,
since
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
effect
the
adequacy
of
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
procedures
but
then
there
is
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
record
and
there
is
a
further
proceeding
going
on
now
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
interim
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
we
address
ourselves
to
a
situation
that
no
longer
exists?
i
mean
the
record
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
spoke
about
now
is
not
the
record
that
now
exists.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
because
you
say
the
rule
has
no
impact
on
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
it
that
tomorrow
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
interim
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
i
suppose
it
did
and
it
upheld
the
interim
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
let's
assume
that
the
procedural
matters
were--
suppose
that
court
of
appeals
were
told
that
their
procedural
approach
to
the
case
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
necessarily
that
court
of
appeals
would
find
the
record
and
the
case
now
before
it
inadequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
speaking
of
foreseeing
long-run
consequences
mr.
ayres
it's
your
brief
i
belief
that
bears
the
clerk
stamp
of
november
26,
the
supplemental
statement
of
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
reason
why
that
came
in
so
late?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
