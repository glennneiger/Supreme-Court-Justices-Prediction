why
do
you
bring
it
up
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
fact
that
they
already
had
this
addition
interim
license,
you
say
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
that
he
lost
the
40
and
got
a
18
month.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
18
month
is
as
good
as
40.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
in
the
world
can
you
say
that?
what
was
it
essentially
getting
40
in
the
first
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
1969.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
you
go
back
to
the
licensing
that's
the
72
bond
right
or
69
bond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
asking
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
you
go
back
to
the
licensing
point,
if
i
am
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
it
took
nine
years
before,
why
would
it
take
that
long
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
did
it
took
from
‘72
to
'71?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
case
was
started
in
‘69.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
'71?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
it's
77.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
they
do
it
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
of
that
is
((inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
what's
going
on
in
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
of
that
is
before
