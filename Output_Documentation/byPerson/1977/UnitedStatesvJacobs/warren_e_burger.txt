chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1193,
united
states
against
jacobs.
mr.
frey
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
then
i
take
it
as
the
educational
function
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
distinguished
from
its
supervisory
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ramps
the
two,
conjoin
at
times.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
include
in
that
--
you
include
in
that
mr.
frey
that
--
that
it
trespasses
on
the
rule
making
power
of
the
--
of
this
court
through
the
judicial
conference
processes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
--
in
other
words,
would
such
a
rule
be
an
appropriate
rule
as
part
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
speaking
of
the
specific
rule,
which
was
laid
down
by
supervisory
power
here,
is
that
within
the
rule
making
power
of
the
--
this
court
through
the
judicial
conference
under
the
statue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
read,
follow
too
literally
the
power
to
enforce
exclusion
rests
exclusively
in
the
constitution
or
the
congress
or
through
the
rule
making
power
and
no
individual
judge
and
no
collection
of
individual
judges
could
impose
such
a
rule,
unless
that
402
does
not
mean
what
it
says.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
that
prevented
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
from
repealing
and
revoking
that
practice
in
the
second
circuit
or
any
other
u.s.
attorney's
office
tomorrow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
thinking
purely
of
power
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
allows,
the
attorney
general
has
traditionally
allowed
variations
in
practices
among
various
districts.
in
order
to
encourage
experimentation,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
second
circuit,
at
least
at
one
time
or
perhaps
the
southern
district
exhibits
all
grand
jury
evidence
which
very
few
of
any
other
districts
do,
is
that
still
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
material,
but
i
merely
suggest
that,
that
variations
are
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
whatever
their
supervisory
power
maybe
is
subject
to
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
seidman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
however
you
define
it,
that
constitutes
a
command
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
--
all
the
united
states
attorneys
in
the
second
circuit,
does
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
what
--
it
imposes
a
sanction
if
he
does
not
--
if
he
does
not
comply
with
the
matter
they
ordered,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
uniformity
was
not
the
only,
was
not
the
fulcrum
of
judge
griffin's
decision
here,
second
circuit
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
read
just
one
paragraph
then.
“in
the
interest
of
uniformity
in
criminal
prosecutions
within
the
circuit
which
is
fundamental
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
we
affirm
the
dismissal
on
count
two
pursuant
to
our
supervisory
function.”
now
is
not
that
the
--
is
it
not
the
basis
on
which
the
second
circuit
decided
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
--
let
me
test
this
out
on
you
then.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
frey's
response
to
a
question
from
the
bench
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
tomorrow
instruct
all
us
attorneys
in
second
circuit
to
go
back
to
the
general,
usual
practice
of
giving
a
no
target
warnings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
can?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
not
be
aware
of
it,
but
i
was
the
author
of
that
report
and
that
did
not
mean
we
were
writing
a
rule,
constitutional
dimensions
or
that
we
were
undertaking
to
suggest
clothing
courts
with
some
kind
of
supervisory
power
to
impose
uniformity.
these
reports
of
the
american
bar
association
are
a
statement
of
what
numbers
of
lawyers
and
judges
thought
would
be
the
right
way
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
taking
here
about
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals,
not
the
wisdom
of
this
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
anything
further
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
estelle
jacobs.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
now
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
not
apply
in
the
eastern
district,
only
in
the
southern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
it
would
not
apply
in
the
southern?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
districts
are
there
are
in
the
second
circuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
make
all
of
them
conform
to
one
of
them,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
this
mean
that
if
in
one
circuit
of
the
great
many
districts,
one
district
decided
or
the
attorney
general
decided
that
in
one
district
they
would
conduct
a
pilot
program
to
give
the
full
target
warnings,
the
most
that
have
been
asked
by
anyone
that
that
would
mean
under
this
approach
all
would
have
to
comply
with
it
forthwith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
manual
ever
issued
from
the
department
of
justice
dictating
the
result
that
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mcnabb-mallory
of
the
constitution
or
rule
5
(a)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
had
to
build
in
exclusion
by
the
will
of
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
sure
in
both
mcnabb
and
mallory
that
that
is
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
statutory
now,
clearly
is
it
not,
not
constitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
has
not
that
type
of
power
traditionally
in
most
cases
been
exercised
prospectively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
a
power
over
a
practice
which
the
court
disapproves,
and
says
hereafter
the
united
states
attorney
will
do
this
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
another
judge
held
the
present
judge’s
chambers
in
contempt
before
he
was
a
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
mr.
seidman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
anything
changed
since
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
accept
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
charges
of
perjury
on
a
specific
day
an
hour
before
a
grand
jury,
how
any
of
those
factors
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
most
of
the
people
who
are
charged
do
go
before
the
grand
juries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
particular
defendant,
is
the
particular
defendant
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
in
half
of
the
cases
or
anyway
near
half
of
the
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
type
of
supervisor
power
to
supervise
the
conduct
of
judges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court,
this
court
have
supervisory
power
over
judges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
mean,
i
take
it
from
your
point
of
view
that
if
the
attorney
general
personally
went
in
regard
as
at
least
the
newspaper
accounts
indicated
he
did
last
week
in
one
case
or
within
the
last
two
weeks
that
the
local
rule
and
the
local
court
of
appeals
can
instruct
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
personally
on
how
he
must
function,
that
is
consensus
of
it,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no.
i
am
narrowing
it
down
to
the
process
that
we
are
talking
about.
you
are
saying
that
the
third
circuit
can
tell
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
when
he
personally
presents
himself
before
a
grand
jury
to
present
an
important
case,
how
he
is
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
united
states
against
estelle
jacobs,
also
known
as
mrs.
kramer,
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
