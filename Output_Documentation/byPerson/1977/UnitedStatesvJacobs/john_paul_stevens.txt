justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
frey
we
are
talking
about
a
rule
requiring
of
giving
target
warnings
or
a
rule
required
that
evidence
be
excluded
if
target
warnings
are
not
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
view
as
i
understand
your
brief
is
that
the
court
would
not
have
the
power
to
exclude
the
evidence
even
if
it
had
adopted
such
a
rule.
it
could
not
discipline,
it
could
not
enforce
the
rule
by
using
the
inclusion
to
power
to
exclude
evidence.
your
reading
of
the
rule
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
do
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
brief.
even
assume
that
the
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
adopted
a
rule
saying
prosecutors
must
give
target
warnings,
it
would
not
follow
from
that,
that
we
could
adopt
a
further
rule
saying
that
if
target
warnings
are
not
given,
evidence
may
be
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact
your
position
is
that
we
could
not
adopt
an
exclusionary
rule
to
enforce
such
a
prosecution
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument
is
it
all
the
relevant
evidences
is
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
on
the
statute
is,
we
could
not
police
the
rule
in
effect,
even
though
we
could
adopt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
but
if
the
rule
adopted
is
merely
one
saying
the
prosecutor
must
give
target
warnings,
that
still
would
not
enable
a
court
to
exclude
the
evidence
--
include
evidence
obtained
by
baloney
(ph)
of
target
warnings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
could
we
have
the
power
if
the
statute
means
if
you
say
it
means.
if
i
read
your
brief,
you
are
saying
rule
402
now
deprives
all
federal
courts
of
any
power
to
adopt
in
exclusionary
rule,
excluding
relevant
evidence
unless
the
rule,
the
evidentiary
rule
is
compelled
by
statute
or
the
connectivity.
may
be
i
misread
your
brief,
but
i
think
that
is
what
your
arguing?
if
that
is
not
sure
argument,
i
don't
understand
your
rule
402
argument,
i
hope
you
will
explain
it
to
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
pursue
it
with
one
further
question
because
i
really
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it.
assume
an
identification
problem
and
say
the
way
it
did
those
cases
where
there
is
a
question
of
whether
evidence
should
be
excluded
because
identification
procedure
in
the
statute
was
improper,
a
lineup
case.
now,
is
it
the
government's
view
that,
that
evidence
could
not
be
--
the
federal
courts
could
not
adopt
an
exclusionary
rule
for
the
federal
system
that
is
different
from
the
constitutional
rule
that
might
impose
upon
the
states?
i
so
not
know
if
i
make
my
question
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
just
saying
if
any
example
is
does
the
court
have
any
discussion
with
respect
to
supervising
federal
courts
that
is
different
in
terms
of
admissibility
of
evidence,
that
is
different
from
its
power
over
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
desecration
include
the
power
to
exclude
because
it
wants
to,
in
affect
require
the
police
to
follow
a
certain
a
practice
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
through
all
the
rules
of
evidence
--
all
the
rules
of
evidence
that
the
courts
have
developed
down
through
the
years
prior
to
the
codification
of
the
rules
have
been
replaced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
court
is
any
longer
free
to
follow
a
rule
that
it
used
to
follow,
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
--
with
the
federal
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mcnabb?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
i
understand
of
course
you
challenge
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
in
this
case
and
you
rely
on
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
section
3501,
on
admissibility.
if
we
were
to
assume
for
the
moment
that
402
and
3501,
neither
those
was
controlling,
would
you
concede
that
apart
from
those
restrictions,
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
what
they
did
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
notes
taken
of
everything,
whether
they
are
transcribed
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
siedman
could
i
ask
you
a
question
please.
you
think
--
assume
we
are
persuaded
by
mr.
frey
on
the
uniformity
is
not
a
sufficient
interest
and
uniformity
within
the
circuit
is
not
a
sufficient
justification
for
exercising
the
court
of
appeals'
supervisory
power
whatever
it
maybe.
do
you
think
the
court
--
this
court
now
in
this
case
has
presented
the
question
whether
its
supervisory
power
would
justify,
apart
from
the
constitution,
would
justify
a
rule
such
as
the
american
bar
association
standards
recommend,
namely
the
target
warning
all
must
be
given
and
that
therefore
we
could
affirm
on
the
basis
that
a
general
rule
applicable
to
the
entire
federal
system
would
be
appropriate
to
implement
that
kind
of
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
contend
our
supervisory
power
is
limited
to
rule
making
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
take
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not
take
issue
with
the
basic
theory
of
mcnabb
rule
for
example?
i
mean,
you
might
not
approve
of
the
exclusion
of
the
confession,
but
the
court
had
the
power
to
adopt
such
a
rule
pursuant
to
its
supervisory
power
in
deciding
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey
you
say
in
cases
such
as
this,
if
you
left
those
words
out,
would
you
say
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
exercised
with
supervisory
power
ever
to
order
the
exclusion
of
evidence
except
on
one
of
the
grounds
already
recognized
such
as
fourth
amendment
violation
or
a
coerced
confession
or
wade
violation,
whatever
this
list
would
be,
it
can
never
oder
exclusion
of
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
am
just
saying
is
your
submission
that
a
court
of
appeals
may
never
go
beyond
what
is
now
the
law
with
respect
to
exclusion
of
evidence?
it
could
never
find
an
action
by
a
strike
force
lawyer
coming
into
the
district
which
violated
a
lot
of
local
rules
never
a
basis
for
suppressing
evidence,
again
that
is
which
is
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
never
could
for
example
be
based
on
a
strike
force
lawyer
coming
in
and
saying
i
am
not
going
to
follow
us
attorney’s
manual
or
what
you
described
to
us,
i
have
got
a
better
way
of
getting
evidence,
i
will
go
out
beat
somebody
up
or
something
like
that.
they
could
never
in
the
third
party
so
that
the
witness
himself
is
not
the
defendant,
the
court
could
never
exclude
such
a
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
miranda
case,
where
there
is
no
constitutional
violation,
just
a
failure
to
give
the
warning
specified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
there
was
a
case
written
later
that
said,
a
michigan
case
that
said
it
was
not
a
constitutional
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
at
all.
it
is
just
a
justification.
how
do
you
know
it
was
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
way.
supposing
mapp
case
were
to
arise
that
day
as
a
case
of
first
impression,
it
had
not
been
decided
before,
we
would
have
to
admit
that
confession
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
of
course
you
are
dealing
with
strike
force
prosecutors
coming
into
the
district,
not
those
who
are
regular
before
the
court
actually?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
not
that
a
special
problem
for
the
circuit
and
to
concern
about
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
try
on
other
example?
we
had
some
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
there
was
a
charge,
a
claim
made
that
the
government
has
abused
its
immunity
powers,
granted
immunity
much
to
liberal
terms
to
get
a
witness
to
testify
against
an
accomplice.
now,
supposing
that
the
court
were
persuaded
that
the
immunity
was
almost
like
a
bribe
and
that
it
made
the
witness’s
testimony
so
inherently
incredible
that
it
should
be
suppressed,
would
a
court
have
power
to
that,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
no
under
(voice
overlap)
