mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
court's
grant
of
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
suppressing
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
as
evidence
in
the
trail
of
a
two-count
indictment,
charging
her
with
transmitting
a
threat
in
interstate
commerce
and
with
perjury
before
the
grand
jury.
respondent
was
employed
as
a
skip
tracer
by
several
bill
collection
agencies
that
subsequently
became
a
focus
of
grand
jury
investigation.
on
one
occasion
she
called
the
brother
of
an
individual
who
had
incurred
gambling
debts
on
a
junkets
of
puerto
rico
and
had
not
paid
them.
in
this
call,
which
unbenounced
to
her,
the
brother
recorded,
she
threatened
the
debtor's
life
if
the
debt
were
not
promptly
paid.
in
june
1974,
respondent
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
and
did
appear
before
a
grand
jury,
being
conducted
by
an
attorney
from
the
department
of
justice
strike
force,
who
was
specially
assigned
from
washington
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
an
investigation
that
encompassed
the
respondent's
activities.
respondent,
when
she
appeared,
was
given
advise
of
her
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
was
also
advised
that
she
could
consult
with
an
attorney
if
she
felt
the
need
to
do
so
at
any
time
and
was
warned
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
of
perjury
and
the
penalties
therefore.
she
was
not
expressly
told
that
she
was
a
target
of
a
grand
jury's
investigation.
during
the
course
of
the
questioning
of
respondent
about
her
employer's
business
and
her
own
activities
therein,
the
government
attorney
read
to
her
from
a
transcript
of
the
threatening
conversations
had
with
the
debtor's
brother
and
she
unequivocally
denied
having
made
any
of
the
statements
contained
therein.
she
was
not
told
of
the
existence
of
the
recording
of
this
conversation.
respondent
was
thereafter
indicted
for
the
substantive
threat
and
for
the
false
testimony
to
the
grand
jury
denying
the
threatening
conversation.
she
moved
the
district
court
to
suppress
her
grand
jury
testimony,
relying
on
the
lower
court
decisions
in
united
states
against
mandujano
and
united
states
against
washington
which
in
one
instance
had
suppressed
grand
jury
testimony
to
for
failure
to
give
full
miranda
warnings
and
in
another
for
failure
to
target
warnings
to
a
putative
defendant.
the
government
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
suppression
ruling,
although
on
grounds
of
supervisory
power,
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
any
finding
of
constitutional
violation.
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
court
followed
a
rather
unusual
practice
of
making
written
inquiry
of
all
united
states
attorneys
in
the
circuit
to
learn
their
policies
with
regard
to
administration
of
target
warnings
and
having
been
advised
that
it
was
their
policy
to
administer
such
warnings,
the
court
upheld
the
suppression
for
the
stated
reason
of
achieving
uniformity
in
the
criminal
procedure
in
this
circuit.
the
united
states
petitioned
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
and
case
was
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
court's
reversal
in
mandujano.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
decision.
it
found
no
occasion
to
depart
from
its
prior
ruling
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
mandujano,
since
the
suppression
ruling
in
that
case
had
been
predicated
on
a
supposed
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights,
whereas
here,
the
court
found
that
none
of
respondent's
rights
had
been
violated.
the
court
thought
its
suppression
order
was
justified
as
a
remedy
to
ensure
that
various
prosecutors
follow
uniform
practices.
in
a
striking
self
contradiction,
the
court
stated
that
its
remedy
was
a
one
time,
ad
hoc
sanction,
intended
to
let
our
citizens
know
that
equal
justice
is
available
to
all.
the
court
indicated
that
it
felt
comfortable
in
pursuing
its
didactic
purpose
of
teaching
the
prosecutor
a
lesson
in
this
case
because
in
its
field,
the
prosecutor
was
not
entitled
to
the
luxury
of
a
perjury
count
as
to
which
the
court
was
effectively
pardoning
respondent
when
they
remain
the
substantive
count
upon
which
prosecution
of
respondent
was
still
possible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
assume
it
means
educational,
teaching.
i
mentioned
that
the
substantive
prosecution
was
impaired,
although
to
a
far
lesser
degree
by
the
suppression
of
respondent's
-
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i
suppose
i
view
the
two
is
being
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
be
here,
of
course.
the
falco
(ph)
question
in
this
case
is
the
power
of
court
of
appeals
to
apply
the
remedy
of
suppression
to
a
defendant's
grand
jury
testimony
as
a
means
of
teaching
the
executive
branch
the
lesson
that
it
must
achieve
uniformity
of
prosecutorial
practices
and
secondly
assuming
some
such
power
exists,
the
soundness
of
court's
exercise
of
that
power
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
think
it
is
best
if
i
begin
by
making
clear
by
what
we
are
not
contending
and
what
the
court
need
not
decide
in
this
case.
first,
we
are
not
contending
that
uniformity
of
prosecutorial
practice
is
undesirable.
it
is
the
hope
of
the
department
of
justice
that
similarly
situated
persons
will
be
to
the
extent
feasible,
similarly
treated
by
federal
prosecutors.
although,
i
think
it
must
be
recognized
that
there
are
so
many
different
individual
prosecutors
handling
so
many
different
matters
of
such
complexity
that
actual
uniformity
in
practice
necessarily
remains
a
goal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
court
of
appeal
was
disturbed
by
that
aspect
of
the
case,
that
is
true.
second
we
are
not
here
today
to
argue
that
target
warnings
are
undesirable
as
a
matter
of
policy.
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
itself
did
not
assert
in
this
case
that
target
waring
should
be
given.
it
said
that
the
department
of
justice
would
be
equally
free
to
require
target
warnings
or
to
prohibit
them
if
it
wished
to
as
long
as
the
practice
followed
was
uniform.
thirdly
this
court
need
not
decide
whether
the
courts
generally
would
have
the
power
to
adopt
the
rule
prospectively
which
would
require
the
administration
of
any
particular
kind
of
warnings
in
the
grand
jury.
well,
i
have
serious
doubts
that
such
warn
--
that
such
rules
would
be
properly
promulgated
by
a
panel
of
a
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
here
is
not
the
power
to
establish
such
rules
as
the
part
of
the
court's
control
over
the
grand
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
how
many
they
are
at
the
moment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
that
the
three
judges
on
this
panel
included
any
former
u.s
attorney.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
--
i
will
get
to
somethings
that
i
think
they
did
not
understand
a
little
later
in
my
argument
[laughter]
about
the
prosecutorial
practices.
in
any
event,
i
was
trying
to
make
the
point
that
the
court
does
--
does
not
have
to
decide
here
the
question
of
the
existence
of
power
as
an
aspect
of
the
power
of
the
courts
over
the
grand
jury.
rather
the
question
here
is
the
power
of
the
courts
to
impose
the
remedy
of
suppression
in
the
absence
of
any
court
made
or
statutory
rule
that
the
prosecutor
has
violated.
the
suppression
of
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
in
this
case
represents,
i
submit,
a
wholly
unprecedented
exercise
of
judicial
supervisory
power
and
we
have
educed
in
our
brief
a
number
of
independent
grounds
for
concluding
that
this
exercise
of
supervisory
power
was
erroneous.
now,
first
of
all
no
one
disputes
that
the
judicial
supervisory
power
maybe
circumscribed
by
congress.
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
disputed
that.
in
part
one
of
our
brief,
we
have
argued
that
two
statutes,
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
18
u.s.c
3501,
deprive
the
courts
of
the
remedy
of
suppressing
relevant
evidence,
especially
if
the
evidence
consists
of
a
statement
by
the
defendant.
i
intend
to
rely
on
our
brief
with
regard
to
these
points
and
pass
on
here
to
our
arguments
that
apart
from
any
statutory
restrictions
on
the
supervisory
power,
the
court
of
appeals'
exercise
of
it
in
this
case
was
improper.
now
first,
we
can
compare,
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
with
any
other
past
exercise
of
supervisory
power
by
this
court
or
indeed
by
other
federal
courts
of
appeals
and
we
can
see
that
there
are
some
striking
differences.
the
case
is
on
which
respondent
relies
and
on
which
the
court
relied,
by
and
large
involve
the
exercise
of
supervisory
power
over
the
conduct
of
the
trial
itself.
that
is
with
regard
to
such
matters
as
voir
dire
questioning
of
prospective
jurors,
conformity
to
rule
11
proceedings,
regularity
in
sentencing
practice,
rules
of
evidence,
rules
regarding
instruction
of
juries,
the
allen
charge,
those
kind
of
matters.
we
do
not
for
moment
question
that
these
kinds
of
rules
are
--
are
inherently
necessary
as
a
part
of
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
appellate
courts
over
the
conduct
of
the
district
courts
and
except
of
course
to
the
extent
any
statute
imposes
restrictions.
we
do
not
think
that
helps
to
justify
the
result
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
here.
the
only
significant
case
it
seems
to
me
which
involves
something,
outside
of
the
trial
context
itself,
is
the
mcnabb
case
which
of
course
is
the
famous
instance
in
which
the
police
violated
the
defendant's
rights
for
a
prompt
presentation
to
a
magistrate
and
the
court
found
that
that
violation
justified
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule,
excluding
the
defendant's
confession.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
important
differences
between
mcnabb
and
the
present
case.
the
first
and
most
significant
is
that
the
probable
basis
for
the
court's
power
in
mcnabb
which
was
the
power
to
make
common
law
rules
of
evidence
in
accordance
with
reason
and
which
was
codified
and
formed
rule
26
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
has
been
abolished
with
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
which
is
a
fresh
codification
and
which
i
think
takes
away
the
supervisory
power
over
evidence
that
may
previously
have
existed.
second
distinction
between
mcnabb
and
the
present
case
is
that
in
mcnabb
there
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
an
existing
statutory
right
of
the
defendant
and
it
was
as
a
means
of
enforcing
this
right
of
the
defendant
that
the
court
acted.
now,
here
there
was
no
right.
the
respondent
had
no
right
to
a
target
warning.
according
to
court
of
appeals,
there
was
simply
an
irregularity
in
practice
and
departure
from
a
informal
departmental
or
u.s.
attorney
policy
involved,
we
think
that
is
a
very
substantial
difference
from
mcnabb.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
the
assertion
of
supervisory
power
here
over
prosecutorial
conduct
that
did
not
violate
respondent's
constitutional
or
statutory
rights
is
undisciplined
and
is
intrusive
on
the
proper
allocation
of
judicial
and
executive
responsibilities.
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
here
was
in
fact
exercising
a
chancellor's
foot
veto
over
law
enforcement
practices
of
which
it
disapproved,
something
that
this
court
in
turn
specifically
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
--
well,
the
rule
that
target
warnings
must
be
administered,
if
that
were
the
rule,
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
rule,
preferably
adopted
by
an
act
of
congress
or
by
amendment
to
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
involves
this
court,
the
advisory
committee
and
the
concurrence
of
congress.
the
rule
that
prosecutor
must
act
uniformly,
we
do
not
care
how,
as
long
as
its
uniform,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
difficult
to
include
in
the
rules
of
criminal
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
well,
i
have
no
difficulty
if
such
a
statute
were
adopted
through
the
rule
making
power
of
this
court.
i
would
have
no
difficulty
with
adherence
to
that
statute,
although
there
would
still
be
a
question
as
to
the
proper
remedy
for
a
violation
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
insisting
here
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
statute.
i
think
it
is
possible
that
the
district
court
could
have
even
--
could
adopt
a
rule
with
regard
to
the
administration
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
are
many
areas
in
which
prosecutorial
discretion
is
--
is
circumscribed
by
rules,
the
brady
rules
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
the
jenk's
act
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
--
i
am
not
sure
for
purposes
of
this
case
certainly,
i
am
prepared.
i
do
not
think
the
court
need
decide
whether
let
us
say
the
district
court
could
adapt
such
rule
or
whether
even
the
judicial
council
of
this
circuit
acting
under
section
330
could
adopt
such
rule
as
has
been
done
in
connection
with
speedy
trial
rules.
these
are
i
think
difficult
philosophical
questions
that
are
not
all
necessary
to
get
into
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
a
very
pertinent
distinction
as
i
suggested
in
response
to
the
chief
justice.
even
if
there
were
such
a
rule
it
would
not
follow
that
the
remedy
would
be
exclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
--
our
brief
is
--
is
essentially
premised
on
the
non
existence
of
any
such
rule
outside
of
whatever
rule
one
might
discern
in
--
in
prosecutorial
practices.
we
would
have
a
different
case
if
there
were
a
rule
adopted
either
in
--
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
adapted
by
a
particular
district
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
not
necessarily
follow
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
sure
that
we
suggest
that
it
could
not
be
done.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh
you
mean
under
the
--
under
the
statutory?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
sorry
i
was
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
it
were
adapted
by
the
mechanism
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
it
would
be
by
statute
or
by
rule
adopted
under
statutory
authority.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
i
think
that
in
so
far
as
the
rule
is
based
on
our
statutory
arguments
or
the
issue
here
is
based
on
our
statutory
arguments,
you
would
have
to
find
a
rule
that
was
violated
and
we
were
not
suggesting
that
if
a
constitutional
right
or
a
statutory
rule
or
a
rule
adopted
by
this
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
had
been
violated,
the
court
would
necessarily
be
without
the
power
as
in
mcnabb
to
adopt
some
kind
of
an
exclusionary
rule.
we
think
it
should
not
even
then
because
--.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
you
are
probably
right
that
is
our,
we
have
a
number
of
steps
however,
even
my
point
is
that,
even
if
you
were
to
disagree
with
the
conclusion
that
rule
402
was
an
absolute
bar,
it
seems
to
me
that
must
--
that
rule
402
requires
the
admission
of
evidence
unless
there
is
an
underlying
violation
of
constitution,
statute.
in
other
words,
rule
402
does
not,
i
think
overrule
the
weeks,
mapp
exclusionary
rule.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
does
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
is
right
because
there
is
a
specific
statute
covering
lineup
identification,
i
assume
you
are
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
mean
apart
from
all
of
the
desecration
that
is
provided
in
other
parts
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
such
as
the
desecration
to
weight
prejudicial
affect
against
prohibitive
value
and
that
the
desecration
in
the
hearsay
exception
to,
i
mean,
there
is
much
desecration
which
is
vested
by
the
evidentiary
code
in
courts
to
make
evidentiary
rulings.
we
do
not
question
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
i
do
not
think
it
does.
unless
constitutionally
--
unless
congress
could
not
constitutionally
abolish
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
right.
you
would
have
to
find
that
the
--
that
the
exclusionary
rule
was
derived
either
expressly
or
by
implication
from
the
constitution,
from
the
statute
or
from
a
rule
of
procedure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
right
by
the
--
by
the
federal,
by
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
rules
of
evidence,
i
think
that
is
right.
in
fact,
the
rules
of
evidence
abolished
the
part
of
rule
26
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that,
that
previously
had
conferred
that
power
on
the
courts.
so
i
do
not
see
that,
that
is
a
serious
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
my
suggestion
is
that
if
a
rule
is
constitutionally
compelled
and
i
assume
that
the
rule
of
weeks
against
the
united
states
must
be
constitutionally
compelled
today
in
light
of
mapp,
of
course
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
alkins
is
--
i
think
alkins
is
overruled
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
mcnabb
is
overruled.
it
is
separately
overruled
by
3501.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
think
---
i
mean,
we
are
--
we
are
relying
on
two
statutes,
each
of
which
we
suggest
independently
takes
away
the
power
that
the
court
might
previously
have
had
prior
to
the
enactment
of
those
statutes
and
anyway
to
return
to
the
question
apart
from
the
statutes
of
what
is
a
proper
exercise
of
judicial
supervisory
power,
i
suggest
that
the
chancellor's
foot
veto
that
was
condemned
in
russel
was
even
more
inappropriate
in
the
case
of
supervising
a
prosecutor's
conduct
than
it
is
in
supervising
police
conduct
in
entrapment
situations.
on
this
connection
the
words
of
the
chief
justice
says,
the
circuit
judge
in
newman
against
the
united
states
are
singularly
opposite
and
i
think
worth
quoting
here.
the
chief
justice
said,
“an
attorney
for
the
united
states
as
any
other
attorney
appears
in
a
dual
rule.
he
is
at
once
an
officer
of
the
court
and
the
agent
and
attorney
for
a
client.
in
the
first
capacity
he
is
responsible
to
the
court
for
the
manner
of
his
conduct
of
the
case,
that
is
his
demeanor,
deportment
in
ethical
conduct,
but
in
his
second
capacity
as
an
agent
and
attorney
for
the
executive,
he
is
responsible
to
his
principal
and
the
courts
have
no
power
over
the
exercise
of
his
desecration
or
his
motives
as
they
relate
to
the
execution
of
his
duty
within
the
framework
of
his
professional
employment.
to
say
that
every
united
states
attorney
must
literally
treat
very
offense
and
very
offender
alike
is
to
delegate
him
an
impossible
task.
of
course
this
concept
would
negate
desecration”
and
now
this
is
an
important
point.
“it
is
assumed
that
the
united
states
attorney
will
perform
his
duties
and
exercise
his
powers
consistent
with
his
oaths
and
while
this
desecration
is
subject
to
abuse
or
misuse
just
as
his
judicial
desecration,
deviations
from
his
duty
as
an
agent
of
the
executive
are
to
be
dealt
with
by
his
superiors.”
now
in
this
case,
i
want
to
reiterate
that
there
is
no
suggestion
here
of
any
deliberate
impropriety
by
the
strike
force
attorney
or
any
departure
from
a
statute
or
rule
or
even
a
published
policy
or
policy
of
general
application.
this
was
at
most
a
negligent
mistake
on
his
part
and
i
like
to
comeback
to
a
point
that
i
mentioned
earlier
in
connection
with
the
wisdom
of
the
courts
attempting
to
enforce
upon
the
prosecutors'
policies
and
that
is
the
court's
can
often
make
mistakes
that
perhaps
the
executive
branch
with
regard
to
its
own
policy
would
not
make.
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals'
second
opinion
in
this
case,
they
relied
upon
the
guidelines
involving
the
relationship
between
the
strike
force
and
the
united
states
attorney
and
they
invoke
the
guideline
that
says
when
a
specific
investigation
has
progressed
to
the
point
where
there
is
to
be
presentation
for
an
indictment,
the
chief
of
the
strike
force
shall
then
for
this
purpose,
operate
under
the
direction
of
the
united
states
attorney,
who
shall
oversee
the
judicial
phase
of
the
case.
now
i
--
my
understanding
is
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeal's
understanding,
that
what
that
means
is
the
strike
force
attorney
is
on
his
own,
until
he
is
ready
to
present
the
case
for
an
indict,
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
investigation
in
the
grand
jury
is
--
is
not
under
the
direct
control
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
this
sense.
it
is
only
when
he
decides
to
indict,
that
he
comes
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
authority
and
the
united
states
attorney
takes
over.
now
i
do
not
rely
on
that
point
for
anything
more
than
to
show
that
when
courts
get
outside
what
seems
to
me
to
be
their
legitimate
domain,
they
are
in
danger
of
making
mistakes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
--
obviously
the
court
did
not
like
the
idea
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
no,
i
of
course
understand
that.
now,
in
terms
of
the
didactic
effect,
our
future
prosecutorial
conduct,
i
suggest
that,
what
the
court
has
done
here,
may
have
exactly
the
reverse
of
what
was
intended,
because
what
they
have
done,
is
they
have
discouraged
to
the
extent
they
are
relying
on
what
they
perceived
to
be
a
uniform
prosecutorial
rule
or
practice
and
punishing
us
for
a
departure
from
that
practice.
they
are
encouraging
us
not
to
adopt
such
practices.
since
what
is
implicit
in
the
decision
of
the
executive
branch
to
adopt
the
practice
like
this
is
the
executive
branch's
expectation
that
it
can
enforce
the
practice,
it
can
decide,
how
important
that
practice
is
and
what
sanctions
are
probability.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
he
--
he
of
course
could
do
so.
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
he
would
do
just
the
opposite
and
then
possibly
require
target
warnings.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
but
not
--
not
with
intention
that
the
courts
can
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
he
has
the
power,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
contest
that
power.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
so
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
one
permissible
approach
that
this
not
a
matter
in
which
there
is
any
external
requirement
that
there
be
a
uniform
rule
or
that
it
is
so
important,
that
the
court
should
justify
in
stepping
in
and
saying
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
there
are
variations.
i
wanted
to
make
two
more
points
very
briefly,
if
i
may
before
my
time
expires.
one
is
that,
to
compare
the
exclusionary
rule
which
the
court
has
an
effect
applied
in
this
case
with
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
and
to
point
out
that
there
is
some
significant
differences
here,
the
most
important
is
that
in
mapp
against
ohio
the
court
said
in
effect,
we
have
no
way
to
control
the
conduct
of
the
police.
the
only
way
we
can
make
the
police
respect
people's
constitutional
rights
is
by
imposing
the
sanction
that
we
have
at
hand
and
that
sanction
is
exclusion
of
evidence
and
we
hope
by
the
employment
of
that
sanction
that
we
will
accomplish
the
salutary
objectives
of
--
of
conformity
of
police
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
now,
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
prosecutors.
if
the
court
announces
a
rule
that
target
warning
should
be
given,
if
it
feels
that
is
appropriate
and
then
let
us
assume
it
has
the
power,
what
reason
is
they
had
to
suppose
that
prosecutors
will
deliberately
violate
that
rule
which
such
consistency
that
exclusion
of
evidence
is
necessary
or
that
if
they
do
violate
that
rule,
the
court
does
not
have
in
its
hand
a
simple
remedy
of
direct
discipline
against
the
prosecutor.
so
the
situation
is
very
different.
in
closing,
let
me
point
to
what
seems
to
me
be
the
quintessential
irony
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
here.
in
its
zeal
to
ensure
uniformity
of
prosecutorial
practices,
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
will
engage
in
apparently
sporadic
half-hazard
imposition
of
penalties
on
prosecutors,
not
in
all
cases,
under
some
identifiable
standards,
but
from
time
to
time,
when
it
feels
it
is
necessary
to
teach
the
prosecutor
a
lesson.
they
sought
to
arm
themselves
with
a
sword
of
damocles
to
wheel
as
they
wish
from
time-to-time.
in
affect
equal
justice
in
the
courts
is
forsworn
in
favor
of
supervision
over
the
prosecutor's
activities.
the
supervision
that
ought
in
principle
to
be
exercised
by
the
executive
branch
itself.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
court
of
appeals
whether
it
had
the
power
is
a
matter
for
review
by
this
court.
this
court
can
--
i
do
not
know,
i
mean,
as
a
philosophical
matter,
as
this
court
says
it
is
improper
to
apply
the
remedy
of
of
suppression
under
these
circumstances,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
in
some
sense
to
do
that
or
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
definitely
and
if
you
say
they
cannot
do
it,
then
in
the
sense
they
do
not
have
the
power.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
short
points,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
questions
about
the
--
whether
there
is
any
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals'
supervisory
power
and
in
this
court's
supervisory
power,
on
the
context
of
deciding
a
case,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
difference.
if
either
the
court
of
appeals
has
it
and
you
have
over
sight
of
that
power
or
i
believe
neither
of
you
have
it.
now,
you
do
have
the
power
in
the
context
of
passing
a
rule
of
criminal
procedures
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
earlier,
but
that
is
a
totally
different
procedure
in
one
to
which
we
would
not
make
exception.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
did
have
it
previously,
yes,
but
we
--
but
we
think
that
-
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
a
rule
of
evidence
and
it
was
a
rule
that
was
predicated
on
an
antecedent
violation
of
another
rule
established
by
statute
or
constitution.
here
we
have
no
antecedent
violation,
and
indeed
no
rule
to
be
violated.
there
is
not
any
rule.
we
can
do
what
we
want
and
that
--
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point,
to
the
extent
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
been
hopeful
that
this
would
encourage
us
to
adopt
the
aba
standards.
this
may
very
well
have
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
by
the
punishment
that
was
administered
in
this
case
because
i
understand
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
they
now
have
stopped
giving
target
warnings,
in
order,
they
have
no
longer
have
a
policy
of
giving
target
warnings,
so
that
they
cannot
be
accused
of
violating
their
policy
and
having
suppression
administered
on
that
basis.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
holding
that
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
was
properly
suppressed
in
the
exercise
of
that
court’s
supervisory
powers.
this
case
arose
when
respondent
was
called
to
appear
before
a
special
organized
crime
grand
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
investigating
extortion
at
debt
collection
activities.
the
grand
jury
was
being
conducted
by
a
strike
force
attorney
from
washington
who
had
been
specially
assigned
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
the
investigation.
the
government
had
evidence
that
respondent
while
employed
as
a
skip
tracer
by
frankie
provenzano
had
other
threats
against
the
life
of
a
gambling
debtor
to
that
debtor’s
bother.
when
respondent
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
she
was
given
a
careful
explanation
of
her
right
not
to
answer
potentially
self-incriminating
questions
and
of
her
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
who
could
be
available
to
her
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
she
was
also
told
about
the
perjury
laws.
she
was
not
told
that
she
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
during
the
interrogation
she
was
not
told
that
the
government
possessed
evidence
directly
contradicting
her
testimony.
in
the
course
of
her
testimony
she
flatly
denied
the
conversation
involving
the
threats
to
the
debtor’s
brother.
the
grand
jury
indicted
respondent
both
of
the
substantive
offense
of
transmitting
a
threat
and
for
perjury
in
denying
the
existence
of
the
conversation.
the
district
court
suppressed
respondent’s
grand
jury
testimony
on
ground
subsequently
invalidated
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
mandujano
when
united
states
against
washington.
the
court
of
appeal
upheld
the
district
court’s
action
not
on
the
constitutional
ground,
but
on
the
basis
of
its
supervisory
powers
that
exercised
these
powers
in
response
not
to
any
violation
of
mrs.
jacobs’
right,
but
to
the
irregularity
perceived
in
the
failure
of
the
strike
force
attorney
to
follow
what
the
court
understood
to
be
the
uniform
practice
of
the
us
attorney’s
office
in
that
district
than
in
the
circuit
generally
to
advise
perspective
defendants
of
their
status
as
grand
jury
targets
when
they
were
called
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
exclusion
of
evidence
in
this
case
was
a
one
time
sanction
which
it
said
it
was
imposing
for
didactic
purposes.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
the
lesson
it
meant
to
teach
the
government
is
not
altogether
clear
to
us
from
its
opinion.
it
explicitly
disallows
any
intent
to
require
of
giving
of
target
warnings
and
while
it
speaks
broadly
of
some
points
of
uniformity
in
prosecutorial
practice
and
making
equal
justice
available
to
all,
both
commendable
goals
in
which
we
whole
heartedly
concur,
rather
points,
its
opinion
seem
quite
explicitly
to
limit
its
concern
to
uniformity
within
a
single
district
and
even
more
specifically
to
conformity
of
strike
force
practice
to
the
practice
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
was
in
eastern
district.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
would
not
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
opinion
the
eastern
district
and
the
southern
district
would
not
have
to
follow
the
same
practice.
indeed,
i
do
not
think
two
assistant
us
attorneys
would
have
to
follow
the
same
practice.
what
would
be
required
it
is
not
clear,
but
what
they
expressly
stated
is
that
the
strike
force
attorney
must
follow
the
practice
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
opinion
suggests
that
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
the
intrusion
of
alien
strike
force
attorneys
from
washington
into
new
york
to
conduct
business
that
i
think
the
court
felt
might
have
been
better
conducted
by
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
what
the
court
was
concerned
about.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
are
other
intimations
of
broader
principles
of
uniformity
in
prosecutorial
practice
generally,
so
that
i
am
not
clear.
i
assume
at
a
minimum
we
can
distill
the
lesson
that
the
strike
force
attorneys
ought
to
follow
the
practice
of
the
us
attorneys.
now,
whatever
the
lesson
was
that
they
meant
to
teach
the
questions
that
this
court
must
decide
or
essentially
too,
the
first
is
whether
the
federal
courts
possess
as
part
of
their
supervisory
powers,
the
power
to
exclude
evidence
as
a
remedy
for
pre-trial
prosecutorial
conduct
that
the
court
finds
distasteful,
but
that
does
not
violate
the
defendant’s
constitutional
or
statutory
rights.
the
second
is
assuming
that
such
power
exists
and
at
least
in
some
cases
was
it
appropriately
exercised?
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
proper
answer
to
both
questions
is
no
and
we
have
advanced
several
arguments
in
our
brief,
any
one
of
which
if
expect
that
would
compel
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
before
turning
to
the
arguments,
i
want
to
inform
the
court
of
a
recent
development
that
has
at
least
background
interest
for
this
case.
on
december
16th
1977,
the
department
of
justice
issued
significant
amendments
to
the
united
states
attorney’s
manual
on
the
subject
of
grand
jury
practice.
under
these
procedures,
grand
jury
witnesses
are
now
receiving
with
the
subpoena
a
printed
advice
of
rights
form
which
briefly
states
the
nature
of
the
grand
jury’s
inquiry
and
advises
them
of
their
self
incrimination
and
counsel
rights.
the
content
of
this
advice
is
essentially
what
was
told
to
mrs.
jacobs
when
she
was
in
the
grand
jury
in
this
case.
in
addition,
the
new
internal
guidelines
direct
the
targets
of
the
grand
jury’s
inquiry
be
advised
that
their
conduct
is
being
investigated
for
possible
violation
of
federal
law.
a
target
is
defined
in
the
new
manual
provision
as
“a
person
as
to
whom
the
prosecutor
has
substantial
evidence
linking
him
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
who
in
the
judgment
of
the
prosecutor’s
appear
to
be
defendant.”
these
new
manual
provisions
represent
an
effort
by
the
department
to
achieve
greater
uniformity
of
prosecutorial
practice
in
the
conduct
of
grand
juries,
the
same
goal
that
the
court
of
appeal
sought
to
foster
by
suppressing
respondent’s
testimony.
now,
the
fact
that
the
department
has
instituted
these
procedures
makes
this
case
if
anything
more
important
than
before
in
our
view.
if
the
judicial
supervisory
power
is
held
to
extent
to
suppression
of
evidence
related
to
prosecutorial
departure
from
uniform
practice,
there
will
be
a
new
category
of
suppression
hearings
to
which
criminal
defendants
will
be
entitled.
in
addition
to
miranda
claims,
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
claims,
wade
stover
claims
and
alike,
the
courts
will
have
to
entertain
jacob’s
suppression
motions
based
upon
allegations
that
internal
guidelines
related
to
prosecutorial
practices
were
that
consistent,
informal
prosecutorial
practices
have
been
violated.
these
inquires
will
not
always
be
easy
since
there
are
numerable
areas
of
prosecutorial
activities
in
which
standard
practices
have
developed
informally
or
are
called
for
by
the
united
states
attorney’s
manual.
looking
just
at
the
aspect
involved
in
this
case
the
concept
of
a
grand
jury
target
is
a
slippery
one,
specially
in
the
context
of
an
investigatory
grand
jury.
often
a
witness
in
mandujano
or
wang
or
mrs.
jacobs
are
all
examples,
would
be
someone
who
could
be
indicted,
but
who
the
grand
jury
is
really
more
interested
in
as
a
source
of
information
leading
to
higher
ups.
in
other
words,
there
will
be
run
for
considerable
controversy
in
interpreting
these
prosecutorial
guidelines
and
the
courts
will
be
shouldering
a
significant
added
burden
in
undertaking
to
supervise
prosecutorial
conduct
by
determining
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
federal
courts.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
which
rule
they
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
perhaps
did
not
fully
consider
in
this
case
what
the
effect
would
be
of
a
rule
that
says
whenever
the
prosecutor
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
assert
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
there
are
6
districts
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
not
clear.
i
mean,
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
lot
of
further
litigation
as
to
what
degree
of
conformity
is
required
and
what
kinds
of
departures
from
norms
of
prosecutorial
behavior
would
justify
a
remedy
such
as
mrs.
jacobs
got
in
this
case.
i
think
it
will
be
futile
feel
for
further
litigation,
but
i
do
want
to
say
that
wholly
apart
from
considerations
of
increased
judicial
workload
that
would
result
from
adding
jacob’s
type
suppression
motions,
there
is
a
serious
of
the
legitimacy
and
of
the
efficacy
of
judicial
efforts
to
enforce
non-statutory
and
non-constitutional
standards
of
prosecutorial
conduct.
inherent
in
the
voluntary
adoption
by
the
executive
branch
of
such
practices
is
the
expectation
that
the
interpretation
and
the
enforcement
of
these
practices
will
be
for
the
executive
branch.
if
judicial
sanctions
are
going
to
be
imposed
for
violations
of
voluntarily
adapted
internal
prosecutorial
practices,
the
wisdom
of
adopting
such
standards
in
the
first
place
will
have
to
be
re-examined.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
at
this
stage
that
remains
a
speculative
matter
and
i
am
not
prepared
characterize
the
court
of
appeals
decision
as
going
that
far.
it
might
be
construed
to
go
that
far.
it
is
the
first
step
towards
a
policy
of
uniform
national
prosecutorial
practice,
but
i
think
it
should
not,
however,
small
the
first
may
be
that
the
court
is
taking
in
this
case.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
taking
that
step
at
all
and
in
this
connection,
i
refer
to
your
statement
on
court
of
appeals
in
the
newman
case
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
prosecutors
have
conformed
to
their
own
standards
of
behavior.
this
is
set
forth
at
page
28
of
our
brief
and
you
said
there
and
i
quote
it
is
assumed
that
the
united
states
attorney
will
perform
its
duty
and
exercise
its
powers
consistent
with
its
oaths
and
while
this
discretion
is
subject
to
abuse
or
misuse
just
as
the
judicial
discretion,
deviations
from
his
duty
as
an
agent
of
the
executive
are
to
be
dealt
with
by
his
superiors.
that
seems
to
be
powerful
consideration
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
given
due
regard
to,
in
any
event,
pragmatic
considerations
aside,
we
do
contest
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
apply
the
sanction
of
evidentiary
exclusion
under
their
supervisory
power
in
case
as
such
as
this.
before
discussing
our
argument
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
i
ought
to
divide
my
response
into
the
different
headings
because
as
i
indicated
we
have
several
quite
different
and
independent
arguments.
under
rule
402,
i
think
that
the
supervisory
power
to
exclude
evidence
has
been
taken
away,
but
that
does
not,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
does
not
in
any
way
undermine
the
result
in
weekes
and
in
the
constitutional
exclusionary
rules
cases.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
think
that
is
our
position.
first
of
all
if
the
action
violates
a
statute,
a
rule
or
the
constitution
then
i
think
there
may
be
room
under
section
402
for
the
application
or
rule
402
for
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule.
as
far
as
inherent
supervisory
power
is
concerned
that
is
assuming
you
reject
our
argument
under
the
rule
402
and
under
section
3501,
i
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
no
power
at
all
to
exclude
evidence.
i
do
suggest
that
this
category
of
case
that
the
court
has
before
today
is
one
in
which
such
power
never
existed
and
in
which
the
court
does
not
have
power,
that
is
the
power
has
to
be
linked
to
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
or
statutory
right
or
else
to
the
supervision
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
be
right,
i
think
that
would
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
at
the
time
that
this
took
place
that
what
we
were
dealing
with
was
a
purely
informal
practice
within
the
us
attorney’s
districts
and
there
was
no
provision
in
the
manual
requiring
the
giving
of
target
warnings.
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
made
its
inquiry
the
first
time
the
appeal
was
before
it
is
the
wrong
question
because
they
asked
what
the
practice
was
at
the
time
they
were
hearing
the
first
appeal
and
they
did
not
even
ask
whether
at
the
time
mrs.
jacobs
testified
there
was
any
practice
in
the
eastern
district
to
give
target
warnings.
in
any
event,
let
me
try
--
in
my
first
argument
i
focused
largely
on
the
point
that
even
assuming
that
there
is
some
supervisory
power
in
this
area,
it
was
improperly
exercised
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
today
i
would
like
to
focus
a
bit
more
on
our
arguments
regarding
the
various
limitations
on
the
reach
of
the
judicial
supervisory
power
which
we
believe
entirely
foreclose
the
use
of
a
remedy
evidentiary
exclusion
in
a
case
such
as
this
if
i
may
use
that
term
and
i
will
elaborate
more
as
i
go
along.
i
will
begin
with
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
i
think
it
is
undisputed
by
anyone
that
the
supervisory
power
of
the
courts
is
subject
to
statutory
restriction
and
we
submit
that
rule
402
does
eliminate
whatever
power
the
courts
previously
enjoyed
to
apply
the
remedy
of
evidentiary
suppression
except
in
the
circumstances
specified
by
the
rule.
now,
the
rule
begins
by
saying
all
relevant
evidence
is
admissible.
if
it
is
what
all
it
said
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
been
correct
in
concluding
that
the
rule
was
not
designed
to
and
did
not
circumscribe
pre-existing
inherent
supervisory
powers.
however,
the
rule
says
more.
it
explicitly
delineates
the
exceptions
to
the
general
requirement
of
admissibility
that
the
courts
are
empowered
to
recognize.
the
rule
is
set
forth
it
several
places
in
our
brief.
i
am
looking
at
page
14
of
our
brief.
it
says
all
relevant
evidence
is
admissible
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
by
these
rules
that
is
the
rules
of
evidence
or
by
other
rules
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
moreover
the
adoption
of
rule
402
was
accompanied
by
an
amendment
to
rule
26
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
eliminated
the
provision
which
had
been
relied
on
in
alkins
for
example
as
conferring
upon
the
courts
a
general,
in
a
sense
common
law
power
to
formulate
rules
of
evidence
under
their
inherent
supervisory
powers.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
distinguish
i
think
two
categories
of
cases
and
i
intend
after
discussing
rule
402
to
turn
to
the
question
apart
from
the
statuary
arguments
what
i
do
think
are
the
limitations
under
supervisory
power,
so
perhaps
i
could
defer
it
that
point.
now,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
limitations
of
our
argument
about
rule
402
are
understood.
we
are
not
calling
into
question
in
anyway
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
apply
the
remedy
of
evidentiary
exclusion,
when
that
remedy
is
necessary
to
protect
constitutional
rights.
the
weekes
decision
stands
unpaired
in
our
view.
the
more
difficult
question
is
when
we
come
to
violations
of
statutory
rights
or
of
rules.
now,
it
is
clear
from
the
rule
that
if
a
statute
or
a
rule
listed
in
rule
402
explicitly
provides
a
remedy
of
evidentiary
exclusion,
of
course
that
remedy
may
be
enforced
by
the
courts,
agreeably
to
rule
402
and
an
example
of
that
is
the
wiretap
statute
which
contains
various
exclusionary
principles,
some
of
which
are
not
constitutionally
required.
but
if
the
statute
or
rule
does
not
specify
exclusion
of
evidences
or
remedy
then
there
is
a
close
issue.
the
rule
on
its
face
would
appear
to
foreclose
exclusion
in
such
circumstances
since
admissibility
must
according
to
the
language
be
provided
by
the
constitution
statue
or
rule.
but
in
any
event
whether
the
court
has
the
power
in
enforcing
a
statutory
rule
listed
in
rule
402
to
exclude
evidence
ancillary
to
that
the
finding
of
a
violation,
there
is
no
way
it
seems
to
us
that
its
power
under
rule
402
continues,
if
it
ever
did
to
reach
out
where
there
is
no
constitutional
violation,
no
statute
over
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
miranda
and
mapp
stand
on
essentially
the
same
footing,
that
is
the
court
--
what
the
court
determines
is
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
and
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
said
the
remedy
is
a
prophylactic
remedy
that
extends
perhaps
beyond
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
getting
on
to
very
slippery
ground,
but
since
it
is
clear
that
this
rule
is
applicable
against
the
states,
it
must
have
a
constitutional
footing.
now,
it
seems
to
be
that
what
the
court
has
done
and
let
us
take
mapp
as
an
example
because
of
course
to
prior
mapp,
it
was
not
clear
that
the
exclusionary
remedy
was
available
against
the
states
for
fourth
amendment
violations.
what
the
court
must
be
saying
is
that
there
has
been
violation
of
constitutional
rights
or
conduct
of
such
nature
in
the
miranda
case
that
we
cannot
distinguish
it
from
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
we
are
going
to
treat
it
presumptively
as
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
and
the
only
way
we
know
to
enforce
those
rights.
the
only
remedy
that
is
available
to
us
is
the
exclusionary
principle
and
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
would
certainly
have
to
under
section
3501,
but
if
section
3501
did
not
exist
that
is
the
issue
which
i
am
saying
is
a
difficult
issue.
i
could
see
an
argument
which
would
say
and
i
would
probably
be
on
the
other
side
of
it,
but
i
could
see
an
argument
which
would
say
that
just
as
the
exclusionary
rule
is
necessary
to
enforce
fourth
amendment
rights
even
though
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
explicitly
contain
an
exclusionary
rule
so
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
is
the
only
way
of
enforcing
the
rights
that
are
protected
by
that
particular
statute
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
a
rule
5
(a)
or
in
effect
the
statutory
provision,
it
promotes
the
statutory,
so
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
i
do
not
think
rule
5
(a)
contained
any
exclusionary
dictate
from
congress.
it
was
a
judicial
variation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
that
is
the
case
and
i
think
that
congress
has
not
passed
a
statute
which
expressly
deals
with
the
question
of
exclusion
in
relation
to
violations
of
the
prompt
presentation
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
it
is
not
constitutional,
but
i
was
responding
to
what
i
understood
to
be
a
question
from
mr.
justice
stevens
about
what
would
happen
in
the
mcnabb-mallory
situation
under
rule
402
and
i
was
saying
that
i
think
it
would
be
arguable
and
indeed
if
you
look
at
the
advisory
committee
notes
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
rule
402,
they
seem
to
contemplate
that
a
mcnabb
and
mallory
kind
of
exclusionary
rule
would
survive.
so
you
would
have
to
balance
the
language
of
the
rule
against
the
contemplation
that
words
use
to
enforce
a
statutory
rights
such
as
in
mcnabb-mallory
it
may
still
exist,
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
for
purposes
of
your
problem
today
because
there
is
no
--
nobody
has
pointed
me
to
constitutional
provision
of
statute,
a
rule
of
the
kind
listed
rule
402
on
which
the
second
circuit
could
predicate
its
decision.
now,
leaving
our
statutory
arguments
and
turning
to
the
question
of
inherent
power,
assuming
there
were
no
statutes,
i
want
to
preface
my
remarks
on
this
point
by
stating
that
we
do
not
for
one
minute
deny
the
existence
the
substantial
supervisory
powers
in
the
federal
courts.
the
case
is
cited
by
justice
marshall
in
his
descent
from
the
initial
remand
in
this
case
unquestionably
established
that
such
powers
exist.
what
is
at
issue
here,
is
the
nature
and
extent
of
those
powers
and
i
suggest
without
substantial
fear
of
contradiction
that
the
court
of
appeals
exercise
of
these
powers
in
the
present
case
is
unprecedented
and
it
is
qualitatively
different
from
the
past
exercises
of
supervisory
power
and
decisions
of
this
court
or
of
other
courts
of
appeals.
and
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
federal
courts
must
be
something
more
than
a
mere
rubert
to
be
invoked
to
justify
any
action
that
the
courts
wished
to
take.
the
fact
that
some
supervisory
powers
undeniably
exist
as
not
if
i
may
borrow
the
words
of
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
in
the
telephone
company
case,
give
federal
judges
the
wide
ranging
powers
of
an
ombudsman.
indeed
in
the
specific
area
of
supervising
police
in
prosecutorial
practices,
this
court
has
expressly
stated
that
the
federal
judiciary
does
not
set
to
exercise
a
chancellor's
foot
veto
over
law
enforcement
practices
of
which
it
does
not
approve,
that
is
in
the
entrapment
cases
in
last
term
in
lovasco
and
talking
about
due
process,
but
in
a
very
related
context
the
court
said
judges
are
not
free
in
defining
due
process
to
impose
on
law
enforcement
officials
a
personal
and
private
notions
of
fairness
and
to
disregard
the
limits
that
bind
judges
(voice
overlap).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
do
not
question
if
that
power
exists.
indeed,
i
think
all
of
the
cases
in
which
supervisory
power
has
been
exercised
can
be
divided
into
two
categories.
the
first
category
which
encompasses
the
vast
majority
of
cases
includes
matters
such
as
the
proper
voir
dire
of
jurors,
steps
to
be
taken
to
avoid
prejudicial
publicity,
proper
jury
instructions
such
as
the
allen
charge,
the
legitimacy
of
these
powers
is
beyond
question,
but
they
are
far
removed
in
kind.
they
are
supervision
of
the
trial
itself
of
what
goes
on
in
the
trial
and
the
court
does
not
need
a
statute
or
constitutional
provision
in
order
to
exercise
that
kind
of
supervision.
that
is
far
removed
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
pass
on
to
that.
i
have
very
little
time
left,
so
i
just
want
to
say,
i
think
the
mcnabb
and
alkin
cases
are
different
from
the
allen
charge
cases.
they
come
closer,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
about
those
was
that
the
court
has
never
exercised
its
supervisory
power
without
finding
a
violation
of
the
defendants'
rights
in
the
mcnabb-alkin
kind
of
cases.
now,
let
me
respond
to
your
point.
the
grand
jury
is
in
significant
respects
a
norm
of
the
court.
federal
courts
have
legitimate
and
substantial
interest
in
over
seeing
grand
jury
proceedings.
now,
we
think
they
have
to
be
circumspect
about
keeping
a
line
between
what
is
intruding
on
executive
branch
functions
and
what
is
proper
judicial
functions,
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
our
argument
today
to
say
that
the
courts
do
not
have
supervisory
power
to
promulgate
a
rule
to
give
target
warnings
in
the
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
we
can
concede
that
the
courts
could
adopt
such
a
rule.
they
could
say
henceforth
you
will
record
all
proceedings
before
a
grand
jury
transcriber.
henceforth
you
will
give
certain
warnings
to
witnesses.
henceforth
you
will
not
call
targets,
but
these
are
prospect
of
rules.
they
are
not
a
retrospective
reaching
out
on
a
selective
ad
hoc
basis
to
pick
a
single
past
instance
of
a
practice
which
the
court
had
never
indicated
before
was
inappropriate
and
imposing
a
sanction
of
suppression.
the
question
mr.
justice
marshal
is
remedy.
it
is
not
the
power
to
make
the
rule.
it
is
the
power
to
impose
the
particular
remedy
which
the
court
selected
in
this
case
of
suppression.
and
i
might
say
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
standards
of
conduct
for
prosecutors.
in
mapp
against
ohio
the
court
found
itself
confronted
with
a
policeman
over
whom
it
had
very
little
power
with
respect
to
whom
it
had
very
little
ability
to
discipline
him
and
it
was
in
a
sense
compelled,
if
it
was
going
to
anything
about
what
it
viewed
as
a
rash
of
otherwise
uncontrollable
fourth
amendment
violations
to
use
a
remedy
of
evidentiary
exclusion.
here
we
are
dealing
with
prosecutors.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
will
not
obey
a
rule
that
is
announced
by
the
courts
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
if
there
are
isolated
instances
of
this
obedience,
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
deal
with
them
by
disciplining
the
disobedient
lawyer
directly
rather
than
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
sure
if
the
strike
–
well,
they
cannot
–
i
am
not
--
i
am
reluctant
to
encourage
the
court
to
get
in
to
the
matter
of
allocating
functions
between
strike
force
and
us
attorney
because
i
think
that
really
is
principally
the
job
of
the
department
of
justice,
but
if
it
were
to
see
fit
to
do
so
it
has
the
power
of
contempt
over
these
people
if
they
come
in.
it
has,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
control
as
over
any
lawyer
who
appears
before
them.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh!
yes.
i
think
that
you
would,
well
not,
the
contempt
power
indeed
requires
an
order
which
is
violated
even
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
precisely
so
and
that
is
one
of
them
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
your
honor,
judge
chamber
did
that
in
oklahoma
when
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
got
a
little
overturn
pretty
rapidly,
but
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
think
before
you
go
to
what
is
a
clearly
a
drastic
remedy
of
taking
a
defendant
who
was
committed
on
offense,
a
serious
offense
of
forgery
in
this
case
and
in
effect
pardoning
that
defendant
as
a
means
of
disciplining
the
us
attorney,
i
think
you
have
to
be
persuaded
that
really
is
a
necessary
part
of
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
rule
402
would
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
you
take
the
funfood
situation
which
i
was
thinking
about
where
judge
wisensky
(ph)
disapproved
the
consultation
between
the
us
attorney
and
the
witness,
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
the
power
to
say
well
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
put
on
that
witness,
that
is
my
point.
