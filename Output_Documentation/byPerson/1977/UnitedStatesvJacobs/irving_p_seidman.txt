mr.
irving
p.
seidman
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
frey
has
most
reasonably
stated
the
underlying
factual
pattern
in
this
case.
however,
whether
it
would
be
from
the
standpoint
of
the
legal
issues
or
the
philosophy
underlying
the
legal
issues,
i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
the
argument
has
failed
to
address
the
problem.
i
do
not
believe
this
case
involves
an
instance
where
the
appellate
court
seeks
to
direct
the
prosecutor
in
what
he
must
or
must
not
say
and
i
believe
the
underlying
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
expressively
states
that,
if
the
prosecutor
wishes
or
the
attorney
general
wishes
they
need
not
as
a
law
is
presently
constituted,
give
any
type
of
warning.
i
believe
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
and
what
i
was
initially
concerned
about
as
defense
counsel
in
this
matter,
who
brings
ten
years
of
having
been
a
prosecuted
as
a
background
to
this
type
of
case,
was
the
conduct
that
would
be
taking
place
before
a
norm
of
the
court
to
with
the
grand
jury.
i
heard
many
questions
asked
to
mr.
frey,
which
seem
to
address
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
chancellor's
veto
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
concerning
what
was
or
was
not
to
be
said
to
a
witness
who
was
a
prospective
defendant
before
a
grand
jury.
i
submit
to
you
that,
that
is
not
the
question,
that
is
not
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case.
i
believe
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
and
is
concerned
with
and
properly
concerned
with,
is
that
the
grand
jury
which
is
a
norm
of
the
court
and
not
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
was
being
used
in
a
manner
that
it
determined,
required
its
action
within
the
scope
of
its
supervisory
power,
and
again
i
wish
to
reiterate
that
the
court
in
its
second
opinion
as
well
as
in
its
first
opinion
indicated
that
the
prosecutor
could
adopt
any
policy
he
wished,
concerning
the
granting
of
any
warnings
to
any
prospective
defendant.
so
therefore,
to
seek
to
have
this
case
revolve
around
a
contest
between
the
exercise
of
executive
power
and
the
exercise
of
judicial
power,
i
believe
begs
the
question
and
fails
to
identify
it
properly.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
respectfully
believe
that
it
does
not.
number
one,
your
honor,
this
court
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
it
only
impose
the
sanction
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
believe
the
court
was
explicit
in
its
articulation
of
the
legal
principle
concerning
the
exercise
of
it's
supervisory
power
that
a)
this
was
not
a
general
principle
to
be
applied
in
all
cases,
that
it
had
considered
particularly
this
fact
pattern
which
involved
the
situation
of
the
court's
grand
jury
the
people's
grand
jury,
not
the
prosecutor's
grand
jury,
sir
and
what
takes
place
before
and
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
that
many
members
of
the
bench
that
related
to
this
problem
maybe
gentlemen
who
have
prosecutorial
background
and
i
believe
that
--
if
that
is
the
case
that
was
important
to
the
consideration
of
this
case
because
any
jurist,
i
submit
most
respectfully,
who
has
not
logged
time
in
a
grand
jury
as
a
prosecutor,
does
not
know
the
omnipotent
power
that
a
prosecutor
has
in
that
room,
concerning
the
witness
and
what
takes
place
to
it.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
grand
jury
is
a
non-functioning
body
which
constitutes
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
prosecutor.
therefore,
what
control
if
any,
can
the
court
have
over
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
before
grand
juries
when
the
court
is
not
there.
the
only
one
who
is
before
the
grand
jury
happens
to
be
the
23
jurists
who
are
fundamentally
mute
in
the
process
that
ultimately
evolves
other
than
determining,
hopefully
whether
an
indictment
is
warranted,
the
prosecutor
and
the
witness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
even
a
statutory
requirement
that
all
of
the
colloquy
that
takes
place
in
a
grand
jury
be
transcribed,
and
therefore,
very
often
as
maybe
the
case,
in
this
case
the
colloquy
that
does
takes
place
is
selected,
assumed
for
good
reason
by
the
prosecutor
and
that
is
what
appears
before
the
court.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
no,
no.
i
am
not
suggesting.
in
the
southern
district,
there
is
a
transcription,
but
that
transcription
begins
and
ends
--
this
is
eastern
district,
that
transcription
begins
and
ends,
when
at
the
direction
of
the
prosecutor
there
is
that
direction.
but
i
believe
that
is
a
side
issue
and
just
merely
to
give
the
court
the
background,
if
it
needs
as
to
what
does
and
does
not
take
place
in
the
grand
jury.
the
question
here
is
as
to
what
motivated
this
court
to
exercise
its
supervisory
power.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
within
certain
confines,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
what
the
court
did
say
sir,
is
that
if
the
united
states
attorneys
in
this
circuit
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
wished
to
adopt
a
rule
that
no
target
warnings
were
to
be
given
that
since
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
requirement
that
it
would
be
possible
for
them,
not
to
give
that
type
of
warning.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
would
disagree
with
that
statement
for
the
following
reasons
your
honor.
i
think,
what
the
court
was
seeking
to
do
was
to
ensure
to
the
citizen
who
is
called
before
the
grand
jury,
since,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
fundamentally
that
is
a
coercive
in
custodial
situation.
although,
this
court
has
previously
ruled
under
mandujano
and
its
progeny
that
there
is
no
constitutional
safeguard
similar
to
miranda
that
apply,
that
there
are
and
there
is
a
situation
here
to
be
dealt
with
and
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
is
that
given
the
large
activity
in
this
circuit
by
the
strike
force
attorneys
and
the
need
that
the
application
of
the
law
or
the
application
of
the
grand
jury
to
a
witness
not
vary
depending
upon
the
personality
of
the
prosecutor,
that
there
should
bean
adherence
by
the
strike
force
attorney
to
the
universal
concept
of
giving
target
warnings
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
cited
back
to
a
decision
written
by
judge
mcdiner
(ph)
in
us
v.
scully
some
23
years
ago.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
there
might
have
been
another
vehicle
which
would
have
--
could
have
caused
the
court
to
come
down
with
a
similar
type
decision
under
different
set
of
facts
if
that
is
what
the
court
is
asking
me
where
there
was
a
dichotomy
within
the
same
circuit
as
to
what
prosecutors
are
doing.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
uniformity
was
not
the
sole
issue
here,
i
believe
that
--
in
addition,
i
believe
the
language
of
the
decision
seem
to
concern
itself
with
the
aspect
of
fairness
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
that
is
the
basis
under
which
the
second
circuit
decided
the
--
the
case
accepting
there
is
other
language
in
the
case
that
would
indicate
that
it
was
not
uniformity
limited
to
the
issue
of
target
warnings.
it
was
seeking
to
make
sure
that
all
witnesses
who
appear
before
a
grand
jury
receive
equal
treatment
and
that
the
public
be
aware
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
if
reading
the
griffin
opinion
in
the
second
decision,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
united
states
attorney's
in
the
second
circuit
could
uniformly
change
the
warnings
that
would
be
given
to
targets
that
they
presently
adhere
to.
whether
i
--
whether
that
could
be
attacked
for
other
reasons,
i
do
not
believe
is
a
matter
before
this
court
at
the
moment,
but
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well
as
i
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well
your
honor,
if
--
if
i
understand
mandujano
and
its
progeny
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
provided
--
provided
you
accept
the
concept
that
mandujano
avoided
the
requirement
of
constitutional
giving
of
--
of
this
type
of
warning
and
there
is
no
statute
that
requires
it.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement,
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
your
honor
then
the
only
source
of
the
target
warning
in
the
second
circuit
is
a
matter
of
practice
adopted
within
that
circuit.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
would
say
that
this
case
involves
one
person
your
honor
and
i
believe
court
of
appeals
had
a
problem
with
that
and
also
seem
to
indicate
and
seem
to
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens
concurring
opinion,
the
first
time
this
matter
was
here,
it
clearly
stated
that
this
is
not
a
general
exclusionary
rule
and
to
talk
about
this
decision
in
general
exclusionary
rule
terms
does
not
really
identify
what
is
said
in
the
circuit
opinion.
i
think
what
--
what
is
being
argued
here
is
whether
or
not
a)
does
the
court
have
this
type
of
supervisory
power
and
b)
assuming
the
statutory
and
ruled
arguments
aside
whether
or
not
the
sanction
which
was
imposed
here
was
an
appropriate
one?
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
that
this
court
should
not
interfere
with
the
supervisory
power
of
the
circuit
court
which
deals
in
the
everyday
problems
within
the
circuit
and
i
am
sure
that
when
it
considered
this
case
involving
strike
force
attorneys
to
come
into
the
circuit
and
identifies
a
prior
case
where
it
concerned
itself
in
depth
with
the
relationship
of
strike
force
attorneys
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
that
was
in
the
persiko
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
had
good
reason
to
feel
that
in
this
particular
case
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
apply
the
sanction
of
suppression
using
the
lack
of
uniform
application
of
warnings
under
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power.
and
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
not
a
rule
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not,
that
establishes
from
this
time
on
any
misstatement
by
a
prosecutor
or
failure
to
state
something
that
is
customary
or
habitual,
assuming
it
does
not
raise
to
constitutional
or
statutory
level
will
be
stepped
upon
by
the
exercise
of
supervisory
power.
i
think
the
court
went
to
great
length
in
an
attempt
to
assuage
this
court
by
its
language
that
it
was
limiting
this
opinion
to
this
particular
case,
and
getting
back
to
the
didactic,
it
may
have
felt
that
this
case
warranted
this
action,
given
the
urban
environment
of
this
circuit.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
cannot
speak
for
the
second
circuit,
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
what
the
second
circuit
said
in
this
case
and
what
it
said
was
that
it
was
not
establishing
an
inexorable
rule
to
be
applied
in
each
and
every
case
nor
was
it
suggesting
that
every
time
a
prosecutor
made
a
mistake,
concerning
accepted
practice
that
it
would
utilize
his
supervisory
power
and
impose
a
sanction
of
suppression
which
ultimately
results
in
the
dismissal
of
a
count
and
an
indictment.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
would
--
i
would
compliment
the
court
and
suggest
that
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
that
the
argument
posed
concerning
3501
has
no
application
to
this
case.
that
the
argument
proposed
by
the
government
with
respect
to
rule
402
has
no
application
to
this
case.
3501
has
no
application
because
this
is
a
denial
of
guilt,
therefore,
through
whatever
attenuated
concept
i
do
not
believe
that,
that
constitutes
a
confession.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
voluntariness
in
this
opinion.
further
as
to
rule
402,
there
is
no
doubt
has
the
court
acknowledged
that
or
relevant
testimony
evident
etcetera
is
applicable
to
the
case,
but
if
you
continue
to
read
on
into
the
rules
of
evidence
and
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
out
of
which
flows
the
inherent
power
of
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts,
i
would
assume
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
do
not
remove
from
the
judges
to
sit
in
a
courtroom
or
rule
on
motions
from
their
discretion.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
1789.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
i
do
know
that
the
constitution
says
--
it
states
that
congress
establishes
a
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
the
court
and
i
am
aware
of
that
statute.
however,
knowing
the
creativeness
of
the
mind
i
would
assume
the
possibly
in
answer
to
your
question
that
some
learned
legal
scholars
might
have
developed
a
theory
under
our
constitution
that
might
have
permitted
that
type
of
approach
by
appellate
courts
to
criminal
law
matters.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
our
concept
of
justice
did
i
not
change
a
great
deal
until
1954
your
honor,
so
that
may
well
be
true,
until
then.
however,
i
am
--
i
am
responding
to
your
question
most
respectfully
and
--
and
seriously
when
i
state
that
and
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
is
created
by
acts
of
congress.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
you
could
your
honor
and
i
would
applaud
it
if
that
is
important.
i
believe
it
became
extra
important
that
this
court
through
its
rule
making
and
supervisory
power
deal
with
the
grand
jury
in
view
of
its
decisions
in
mandujano,
washington
and
wang
and
i
so
not
stand
here
to
suggest
that
i
condone
perjury
in
this
argument.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
condones
it
and
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
the
exercise
of
a
supervisory
power
in
the
context
of
what
takes
place
before
a
grand
jury.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
that
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
i
think
you
are
asking
too
much
of
me.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
but
however,
i
think
getting
back
to
judge
--
justice
stevens'
suggestion
which
i
believe
is
a
manageable
one
and
that
is
given
the
fact
that
the
american
bar
association
has
done
an
extensive
study
in
the
criminal
justice
area,
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
stevens,
he
was
asking
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
should
adopt
the
recommendation
of
the
aba
as
is
recited
in
the
jacob's
opinion
and
--
and
possibly
the
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
been
hopeful
that
supreme
court
taking
the
look
at
that
which
says
if
prosecutor
believes
that
a
witness
is
a
potential
defendant,
he
should
not
seek
to
compel
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
without
informing
him
that
he
may
be
charged
and
that
he
should
seek
independent
legal
advice
concerning
his
rights
that
is
a
recommendation
by
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
agree
with
the
court
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
i
assume
that
the
entire
standards
as
finally
adopted
should
become
necessarily
the
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
getting
back
to
the
heart
of
this
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
exercised
supervisory
power
not
in
conflict
with
section
3501
or
with
rule
402
and
the
the
--
the
best
thinking
of
the
court
as
to
why
it
was
doing
it,
i
believe
is
--
is
the
quote
given
in
the
opinion
where
the
court,
quote
is
from
judge
friendly
in
u.s.
v.
stepper
(ph)
and
stated,
a
reversal
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
indictment
may
help
to
translate
the
assurances
of
united
states
attorneys
into
consistent
performance
by
their
assistant.
again,
this
is
a
sole
limited
narrow
issue
that
is
before
this
court
and
it
does
not
particularly
have
relationship
solely
with
respect
to
target
warnings.
it
might
well
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
as
stated
by
mr.
frey,
may
in
some
future
matter,
unforeseen,
seek
to
exercise
its
supervisory
power
and
i
cannot
believe
that
this
court,
given
the
long
line
of
cases,
some
of
which
your
honor
has
written,
mr.
justice
burger
--
chief
justice
burger
has
written
opinions
in,
has
identified
and
recognized
the
supervisory
power
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
deal
with
matters
within
the
circuit
and
if
i
may
respectfully
relate
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
first
jacob's
case,
the
case
has
cited
therein
the
cupp
v.
naughten
case,
barko
v.
wingo,
united
states
v.
thomas,
ristaino
v.
ross
and
murphy
v.
florida,
some
of
which
have
their
opinions
from
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
clearly
acknowledged
the
existence
of
propriety
of
exercise
of
supervisory
powers
and
at
times,
the
opinions
seek
to
avoid
the
exercise
of
federal
supervisory
power
in
general
--
in
state
criminal
cases,
but
use
of
affirmative
language
which
clearly
states
that,
had
this
been
a
federal
court
matter
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
these
instances
would
have
recommended
the
utilization
of
supervisory
power
to
justify
whatever
court's
concept
of
fair
and
equal
application
of
the
law
to
all
people.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
sanction
herein,
given
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
am
limited
to,
is
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
not
escaping
justice,
so
therefore,
i
do
not
know
that
the
sanction
part
of
this
case
is
that
troublesome.
the
only
issue
that
i
could
conceive
of
as
being
of
importance
to
the
--
and
crucial
to
this
is,
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
application
of
the
supervisory
power
and
again
i
wish
to
reiterate
in
--
in
my
closing
argument
that
this
not
a
trial
proper
that
is
before
the
court.
what
is
before
this
court
is
the
conduct
and
management
of
the
grand
jury
which
is
norm
of
the
judiciary
and
not
a
norm
of
the
executive
branch
of
government
and
i
believe
it
was
in
this
context,
the
court
of
appeals
so
ought
to
apply
its
supervisory
power
not
of
the
prosecutor,
which
is
the
effect
of
what
has
happened
here,
but
rather
as
to
what
takes
place
before
the
court's
grand
jury,
before
which
the
prosecutor
practices
as
a
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
government.
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
first
case,
it
would
assume
--
it
is
clear
to
me
that
this
is
not
an
inexorable
rule
to
be
applied
in
all
instances
and
this
court
need
not
be
fearful
that
with
each
slip
of
the
tongue
in
any
particular
criminal
law
prosecution
that
there
will
be
a
--
a
dismissal
or
suppression
which
would
result
in
non
prosecutorial
happenings
with
respect
to
people
who
should
be
prosecuted.
and
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
stated
that
it,
in
deciding
this
case,
it
a
perjury,
but
it
felt
that
given
the
fact
that
there
was
another
portion
of
the
case
to
be
tried,
that
it
could
take
this
law
just
so
to
speak,
if
the
court
wanted
to
picture
it
as
such
and
employ
the
sanction
of
suppression,
and
therefore,
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
which
flow
there
from.
i
might
--
i
might
add,
getting
back
to
what
mr.
chief
justice
burger
stated
that
given,
in
closing,
given
the
fact
that
the
citizen's
rights
before
the
grand
jury
have
been
limited
by
mandujano,
wang
and
washington
that
consistent
with
what
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
that
possibly
and
humbly
this
court
might
consider
the
aba
standards
as
to
what
should
be
the
procedure
before
the
grand
juries
which
represent
throughout
the
united
states,
all
of
--
all
of
the
people.
i
thank
you.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
may
please
the
court.
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
are
here
a
second
time,
but
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
mr.
frey
has
used
his
first
argument
on
the
second
occasion.
if
for
us
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
would
have
hoped
that
he
would
have
considered
my
argument
more
fully
your
honor.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
it
is,
for
a
humble
lawyer,
it
is
always
an
honor
to
appear
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
mr.
frey
has
most
reasonably
stated
the
underlying
factual
pattern
in
this
case
except
that
i
would
wish
to
inform
the
court
that
the
defendant
in
this
matter
is
a
housewife
who
had
part
time
employment
and
for
whatever
it
is
worth,
my
law
firm
represents
this
defendant
with
respect
to
the
appellate
part
of
this
case
in
a
pro
bono
publico
decision.
i
think
that
is
important
to
indicate
that
this
defendant
does
not
appear
here
represented
by
a
high
priced
attorney
nor
is
she
a
seasoned
witness
represented
by
a
counsel
when
she
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
just
mentioned
it
to
the
court
for
background,
your
honor.
i
wish
to
get
into
the
case
as
to
the
law.
however,
whether
it
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
legal
issues
or
the
philosophy
underlying
the
legal
issues,
i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
the
argument
by
mr.
frey
has
failed
to
address
the
problem.
i
do
not
believe
this
case
involves
an
instance
where
the
appellate
court
seeks
to
direct
the
prosecutor
in
what
he
must
or
must
not
say
and
i
believe
the
underlying
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
states
that
if
the
prosecutor
wishes
or
the
attorney
general
wished,
they
need
not
us
the
law
has
presently
constituted,
give
any
type
of
target
warning
and
as
time
has
indicated
the
attorney
general
of
the
unites
states
has
deemed
it
appropriate
to
adopt
the
requirement
of
target
warnings
as
a
uniform
practice
outside
the
scope
of
constitutional
and
statutory
requirement
in
the
united
states
of
america,
effective
i
believe
february
the
15th,
1978
or
there
about.
i
believe
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
and
what
i
was
initially
concerned
about
as
defense
counsel
in
this
matter
who
brings
approximately
ten
years
as
a
prosecutor
as
a
background
to
this
type
of
case
was
a
conduct
that
would
be
taking
place
before
an
arm
of
the
court,
to
a
grand
jury.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
an
issue
of
an
appellate
court
seeking
to
exercise
its
chancellor’s
veto
of
executive
branch
practice.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
since
the
court’s
constitutional
rulings
in
mandujano
and
its
progeny
that
absent
the
exercise
of
supervisory
power
over
grand
jury’s
by
appellate
and
district
court,
this
is
court
has
left
bare
the
protection
and
the
requirement
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
equal
and
fair
justice,
any
concept
of
protection
to
any
witness
who
appears
before
the
grand
jury.
for
the
court
has
clearly
stated
that
there
is
no
requirement
for
miranda
warning,
target
warnings
of
any
type
in
that
type
of
setting.
i
believe
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
and
this
concerned
with
them
properly
concerned
with
is
the
grand
jury
which
is
a
norm
of
the
court
and
not
the
executive
branch
of
government.
and
again,
i
wish
to
reiterate
that
the
court
in
its
second
opinion
as
well
as
in
its
first
opinion
indicated
that
the
prosecutor
could
adopt
any
policy
concerning
this
matter.
the
question
really
is
your
honor
whether
or
not
any
witness
who
appears
before
a
grand
jury
should
expect
uniform
application
from
the
standpoint
of
fairness
and
from
the
standpoint
of
what
is
the
accepted
practice
within
that
circuit
which
is
an
urban
circuit
consisting
of
six
different
districts
of
whether
or
not
the
application
of
practice
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
six
districts.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
and
vermont
and
vermont
is
not
urban.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
i
stand
corrected
your
honor
[laughter]
to
the
extent
that
that
geographical
population,
i
was
trying
to
guess
correct.
however,
the
entire
district
and
the
workload
of
this
second
circuit
certainly
is
a
most
responsible
one
and
i
believe
what
the
court
was
seeking
to
do
is
not
retrospectively,
but
rather
prospectively
and
currently
dealing
with
the
situation
which
it
faced
in
that
circuit
and
there
as
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
second
circuit
had
previously
admonished
and
warned
the
strike
force
attorneys
appearing
before
it
and
then
its
circuit,
in
the
persico
(ph)
case
that
they
had
an
obligation
to
identify
with,
become
informed
with,
and
follow
the
guidelines
not
only
of
their
work
in
the
circuit,
but
the
requirement
that
they
operate
with
and
in
conjunction
with
and
under
the
direction
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
particular
district
involved.
for
mr.
frey
to
suggest
that
this
was
a
retrospective
application
is
incorrect
in
view
of
persico
case
where
the
court
not
only
issued
a
formal
opinion,
but
annexed
thereto
a
copy
the
appropriate
guidelines
that
were
involved.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
probably
no
more
important
aspect
of
the
criminal
justice
process
than
as
grand
jury
because
it
is
before
the
grand
jury
that
supposedly
the
determination
is
made
whether
one
becomes
a
defendant
or
is
determined
not
to
be
formally
charged.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
ultimately
in
the
process,
in
the
federal
process,
i
would
say
that
a
good
number,
if
not
half
of
the
cases
are
grand
jury
origin
your
honor
rather
than
summary
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
in
the
second
circuit
and
particularly
in
the
southern
district
and
in
the
eastern
district
of
the
circuit
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
the
practice
and
was
a
practice
and
this
is
what
disturbed
the
court
in
this
instance
after
having
given
fair
warning
to
the
strike
force
attorney
to
notify
defendants
that
there
is
a
matter
pending
before
the
grand
jury
and
should
they
wish
to
payable
for
the
grand
jury,
although
they
are
targeted
that
they
have
that
right
to
do
so
and
that
is
the
accepted
practice
and
apparently
that
now
is
the
accepted
practice
in
the
united
states
of
america
pursuant
to
the
guidelines
now
issued
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
might
further
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
of
sanction
in
this
case
really
does
not
present
any
problem
unless
one
determines
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
inherent
power
to
supervise
the
conduct
the
prosecutors
before
an
arm
of
the
court
which
is
a
grand
jury.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
within
its
circuit,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
you
do
sir
and
i
believe
there
have
been
instances
of
its
application
and
i
would
assume
that,
that
did
not
emanate
out
of
any
constitutional
or
statutory
scheme
and
that
is
what
cited
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
remand
portion
of
this
case.
this
court
and
the
chief
judge
has
acknowledged
the
existence
of
the
supervisory
power
and
enumerated
cases
therein
and
has
acknowledged
the
effective
and
proper
utilization
of
sanction
by
way
of
suppression
as
a
means
of
fulfilling
that
supervisory
power.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
submit
that,
that
is
not
the
issue
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
that
may
well
be
the
government's
posissue,
but
i
think
this
court
in
its
seasoned
and
reasoned
judgment
would
see
beyond
that
myopic
approach
to
what
is
a
fit
here.
what
the
government
really
is
seeking
to
state
and
propose
is
that
pursuant
to
rule
402
that
appellate
courts
do
not
have
the
supervision
or
even
district
courts
as
to
what
evidence
or
what
conduct
goes
before
those
areas
that
are
within
its
domain
which
include
the
trial
court
and
the
grand
jury
and
i
might
submit
to
the
court
that
section,
rule
402
and
its
wording
merely
states
that
relevant
evidence
is
admissible.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
court
has
supervisory
power
over
the
conduct
of
affairs
of
the
judiciary
in
united
states
of
america
which
would
include
the
second
circuit.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
so
and
i
have
not
suggested
anything
to
the
contrary.
however,
the
analogy
of
the
allen
charge
under
diversity
of
practice
within
the
circuit
and
the
fact
that,
that
does
exist
and
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
chosen
to
apply
a
uniform
standard
or
universal
standard
here
in
the
united
states,
if
anything
buttresses
my
position
that
the
second
circuit
with
respect
to
its
jurisdiction
could
certainly
adopt
a
procedure
or
a
concept
of
what
should
take
place
before
its
grand
juries
that
have
reasonableness
and
nobody
has
contended
that
the
suggestion
that
the
requirement
of
a
target
warning
be
given
is
unreasonable.
and
if
anything,
the
fact
that
the
us,
the
attorney
general
has
adopted
that
practice
adds
weight
to
the
significance
of
this
case
and
the
requirement
in
acknowledging
the
existence
of
the
supervisory
power
of
the
circuit
court
when
reasonably
exercised
and
in
this
case
adoption
by
the
attorney
general
which
shows
some
type
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
concept
that
the
supervisory
power
is
what
is
at
issue
here
and
not
whether
or
not
my
client
who
faces
prosecution
on
another
aspect
of
this
charge
has
or
has
not
committed
perjury.
i
do
not
stand
before
this
court
to
condone
perjury
and
that
has
never
been
my
argument.
however,
i
do
not
believe
when
the
circuit
court
stated
that
this
court
has
adopted
a
rule,
a
principle
of
law
that
in
any
perjury
indictment
that
per
se
there
is
no
concept
of
suppression
or
the
sanction
of
suppression.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
in
the
mandujano
case
which
was
a
plurality
opinion,
i
believe
that
there
was
an
acknowledgment
that
there
might
be
some
situations
in
which
even
given
a
perjury
that
the
sanction
of
suppression
would
be
applicable.
i
might
add
that
there
has
not
been
a
trial
in
this
matter
and
all
that
the
indictment
really
is
hopefully
is
an
allegation.
the
posture
of
this
case
is
one
of
acquisition.
the
posture
of
this
case
as
to
the
consideration
of
the
point
of
law
or
principle
of
law
involved
herein
is
what
took
place
before
that
grand
jury
and
whether
or
not
the
circuit
or
the
district
court
could
apply
its
supervisory
power,
which
obviously
was
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
given
the
adoption
of
the
same
principle
of
law
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
and
what
is
at
issue
here,
is
can
this
court
or
should
this
court,
in
essence,
interfere
with
the
reasoned
judgment
of
a
circuit
court
that
had
previously
warned
prosecutors
that
given
strike
force's
failure
to
adhere
to
certain
standards
that
it
was
giving
them
fair
warning
that
the
next
time
it
would
apply
sanctions.
i
might
add
that
if
this
court
interferes
with
the
supervisory
application,
a
circuit
court
power
then
it
would
be
adopting
the
suggestion
of
mr.
frey
which
i
believe
this
court
could
not
reasonably
entertain.
there
is
no
way
that
a
circuit
court
nor
the
defense
counsel
can
supervise
each
and
every
prosecutor
as
to
what
he
or
she
does,
just
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
this
court
to
supervise
each
and
every
judge
within
its
jurisdiction
as
to
what
he
or
she
does,
and
therefore,
the
essence
of
the
supervisory
power
is
to
permit
the
court
to
guide
in
general
terms,
the
conduct
of
those
who
are
responsible
and
the
performance
of
their
duties
within
its
jurisdiction.
in
this
instance,
the
jurisdiction
is
not
the
executive
branch
of
government.
the
jurisdiction
is
a
grand
jury.
there
is
no
argument
and
case
law
and
statute
is
clear
that
the
grand
jury
is
a
norm
of
the
court.
that
means
that
it
is
created
by
the
court,
it
is
supervised
by
the
court,
the
grand
jury
reports
back
to
the
court
and
if
need
be,
the
prosecutor
can
be
excluded
from
appearing
before
that
arm
of
the
court.
for
mr.
frey
to
suggest
that
the
grand
jury
in
some
way
is
a
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
i
believe
is
the
sanction,
is
a
cause
of
the
sanction
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
i
take
that
back,
but
it
was
my
impression
that
he
is,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
the
application
of
a
sanction
in
this
case
is
an
interference
with
the
executive
branch
to
government.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
however,
justice
what
i
say
before
this
court
is
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
that
maybe
the
weakness
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
well,
i
am
a
former
state
prosecutor,
but
and
i
do
understand
what
takes
place
before
grand
juries
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
reconsider
some
of
its
constitutional
rulings
in
this
area,
but
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
to
deal
in
this
matter,
but
again
getting
back
to
the
point
that
was
i
seeking
to
make
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
way
that
a
supervisory
court
can
exercise
supervisory
power
unless
as
a
concomitant
of
that
power
it
had
an
ability
to
apply
sanctions.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
instance
the
sanction
that
was
imposed
here
which
results
in
the
dismissal
of
the
perjury
indictment
related
not
to
the
perjury,
not
to
the
perjury
count,
but
rather
to
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
in
failing
to
adhere
to
a
prior
written
formal
warning
to
strike
force
attorneys.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
not
per
move
from
circuit
courts,
its
wisdom
in
determining
when
it
should
apply
sanctions
of
this
type.
i
do
not
believe
this
court
should
be
led
to
believe
as
mr.
frey
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
would
be
a
nuance
load
of
litigation
in
this
matter,
involving
failure
to
comply
with
the
internal
guidelines.
this
circuit
was
clear
in
stating
that
they
were
not
creating
any
general
exclusionary
rule,
nor
were
they
in
any
way
suggesting
that
in
each
and
every
time
that
a
prosecutor
failed
to
dot
a
t
--
dot
an
eye
across
the
t
(ph)
that
there
would
be
the
sanction
of
suppression
and
the
failure
of
an
indictment.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
clearly
stated
that
this
was
a
ad
hoc
one
time
sanction
falling
within
its
desire
to
inform
strike
force
attorneys
that
failure
to
apply
to
the
circuit
court's
practices
before
grand
juries
has
to
result
in
this
sanction.
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
only
as
to
how
he
can
function
as
he
practices
law
before
the
grand
jury
and
before
that
court.
the
court
does
not
seek
to
tell
the
attorney
general
who
he
is
to
investigate,
how
is
he
--
mr.
irving
p.
seidman
i
believe
that,
that
is
absolutely
so
your
honor
and
by
that
i
assume
that
the
court
is
not
telling
him
what
facts
or
how
to
investigate,
but
within
its
concept
of
fair
play
and
the
application
of
equal
justice
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
should
expect
to
receive,
i
believe
that
the
court
can
within
that,
in
that
circuit
so
instruct
him
sir.
and
i
do
not
believe
that,
that
would
have
in
anyway
and
does
not
anyway
interfere
with
his
exercise
of
his
executive
power.
there
are
concepts
or
principles
that
fall
within
the
sole
and
exclusive
province
of
the
court
and
i
sought
to
state
to
the
court
that
the
conduct
of
the
grand
jury
is
in
the
sense
of
what
it
listens
to
and
how
witnesses
are
treated
there
is
something
that
should
be
and
is
within
the
province
of
the
court
and
not
within
the
province
of
any
particular
prosecutor
depending
upon
how
he
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
determines
he
is
going
to
treat
a
witness
before
that
grand
jury.
in
closing,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
suggestion
by
mr.
frey
that
the
failure
of
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
to
adhere
to
internal
guide
of
lines
is
not
the
sole
and
total
issue
here.
the
question
really
is
whether
or
not
the
second
circuit
can
from
the
standpoint
of
fairness
and
the
expectation
of
equal
treatment
by
its
citizens
require
that
once
government
has
chosen
a
line
of
approach
that
singular
or
particular
prosecutors
not
have
their
own
personal
predilections
apply
with
respect
to
the
application
of
that
particular
principle.
and
as
judge
friendly
stated
in
the
estepa
(ph)
case
which
again
was
recognition
of
the
court's
supervisory
power
also
involving
a
perjury
case
that
he
stated
“we
had
hoped
that
with
the
clear
warning
we
have
given
to
prosecutors
and
the
assurances
given
by
united
states
attorneys
a
reversal
for
him,
properly
use
a
fair
say
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
be
required.”
here
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
whether
willingly
or
unwillingly,
we
prefer
to
think
the
latter,
clearly
violated
the
first
of
these
provisos.
we
cannot,
with
proper
respect
for
the
discharge
of
our
duties,
content
ourselves
with
yet
another
admonition.
a
reversal,
with
the
instructions
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
may
help
to
translate
the
assurances
of
the
united
states
attorneys
into
the
consistent
performance
by
their
assistance.
i
think
really
that
is
what
is
at
the
heart
of
this
particular
case
and
its
singular
application
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
if
the
court
recognized
the
existence
of
such
supervisory
power
in
estepa,
i
see
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
estepa
case.
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
has
adopted
these
new
guidelines
which
seem
to
adopt
what
was
at
issue
here,
i
believe
do
not
deal
with
the
essence
of
this
case
and
there
should
be
affirmance
of
the
circuit
court's
opinion
to
sustain
its
authority
to
supervise
the
conduct
of
its
affairs
before
that
court.
