what
does
the
word
didactic
mean?
justice

overrules
those
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
really
had
anything
to
do
with
the
court's
concern
about
possible
prosecutorial
abuse
of
the
grand
jury.
since
as
i
read,
judge
griffin's
opinion,
so
long
as
they
do
the
same
thing
in
every
district,
it
does
not
make
a
difference,
what
they
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
reversal
here
was
not
based
on
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
this
particular
thing
done
by
the
grand
--
the
u.s.
attorney
was
improper,
had
it
been
done
uniformly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
--
it
seems
to
be,
it
is
hard
to
--
hard
to
support
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
concern
you
expressed
for
abuses
that
go
on
in
the
grand
jury
room,
since
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
u.s.
attorneys,
take
your
choice,
but
just
make
one
choice
or
the
other
and
apply
it
uniformly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
not
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
not
based
on
the
requirement
that
--
that
target
warnings
be
given,
but
on
the
basis
that
whether
they
be
given
or
not
the
practice
ought
to
be
uniform?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
--
you
say
the
constitution
of
united
states
from
which
flow
the
inherent
powers
of
this
court,
do
you
think
that
before
congress
provided
for
appeals
in
criminal
cases
from
the
district
courts
in
1889
or
whenever
it
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
1889,
for
a
100
years
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
from
a
criminal
sentence
in
the
district
court
to
this
court,
do
you
think
there
was
some
sort
of
an
inherent
authority
in
this
court
to
review
an
appeal
on
those
kind
of
criminal
judgments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
non
surfaced
in
the
19th
century
at
any
rate?[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey
when
you
are
saying
inherent
supervisory
power,
do
you
mean
anything
more
than
the
authority
of
any
appellate
court
to
reverse
a
trial
court
on
a
basis
not
other
than
--
on
a
basis
that
does
not
depend
on
the
statute
of
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
really
mean
that
you
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
are
here
a
second
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
seidman
does
not
this
court
have
the
same
sort
of
supervisory
power
over
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
over
us
attorneys
or
the
district
court
just
by
virtue
of
our
power
to
grant
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
if
the
second
circuit
decides
there
is
going
to
be
no
more
allen
charges
as
my
brother
stewart
gave
in
hypothesis
to
your
colleague
mr.
frey,
and
reverses
the
conviction,
the
government
can
petition
here
and
we
in
turn
would
be
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
allen
charge
was
to
be
a
matter
of
national
uniformity
or
whether
it
is
up
to
each
circuit,
but
anyway
we
would
have
a
right
to
review
this
second
circuit's
determination?
