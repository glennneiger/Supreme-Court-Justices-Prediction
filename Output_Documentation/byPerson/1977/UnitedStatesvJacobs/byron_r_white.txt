comes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
as
of
it
precisely
the
same
thing
happened
next
week?
i
think
second
circuit
would
not
exclude
the
evidence?

r.
white
well,
suppose
they
had
made
such
a
rule
and
just
announced
it,
you
either
do
it
this
way
or
the
evidence
will
be
excluded,
if
that
would
and
said
this
is
a
--
this
rule
is
made
under
our
--
our
supervisory
power.
you
say
that
situation
is
not
here?
of
course
somebody
might
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
it
is.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
forbidden
by
the
federal
rules
of
evidence?
