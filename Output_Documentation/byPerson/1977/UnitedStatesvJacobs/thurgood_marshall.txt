justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
used
the
word
“supervisory,”
instead
of
that
it
still
would
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
mr.
frey
there
is
quite
an
oversupply
from
u.s.
attorneys
on
the
second
circuit.
you
know
how
many
they
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
a
quite
a
few,
i
mean,
need
not
deal
then
somebody
did
not
know
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
talk
about
the
whole
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
had
to
be
a
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
given
up
too
much,
you
are
not
going
to
give
prosecutorial
discretion,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
not
by
the
court
without
the
benefit
of
rule
or
statute,
you
would
not
want
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what’s
that
statement
about
not
forgetting
what
you
know
as
men?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
forgetting
what
you
know
as
men
even
though
you
are
judge,
you
have
lane
v.
wilson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
justice
frankfurter,
what
i
am
saying,
these
former
prosecutors
know
what
you
and
i
know,
that
there
is
always
been
some
tension
between
strike
forces
and
washington(voice
overlap)the
lawyers
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
just
the
southern
district?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
the
conviction
would
be
valid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
do
not
answer
that
probably
do
i
want
to
say
we
then
release
this
woman
or
retry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
second
circuit
said
that
this
rule
could
be
changed
tomorrow
morning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
have
great
problem,
then
this
just
involves
one
person
and
no
precedential
value
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
siedman
if
i
understand
you
correctly
we
could
issue
a
rule
that
there
must
be
uniformity
among
all
of
the
prosecuting
attorneys
and
what
they
present
to
a
grand
jury,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
should
not
we
also
say
that
the
judges
should
be
uniform
in
their
sentences,
i
mean,
while
we
are
at
it.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
while
we
are
(inaudible)
we
should
get
into
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
courts
are
you
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
this
court
had
set
up
their
own
rule
and
you
say
they
do
not
like
it.
the
second
circuit
said
these
rule,
they
are
not
complaining
about
it,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
the
rule
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
involved
in
this
case
is
not
complaining
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
assume
you
know
more
about
the
business
of
the
second
circuit
than
the
second
circuit
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey,
i
assume
you
can
draw
a
line
between
out
of
court
and
in
court,
the
way
you
put
to
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
in
the
very
case
where
a
federal
judge
over
the
years
returning
in
contempt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
god
what
happened
to
him?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
persuaded
that
this
might
not
have
been
the
right
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
fray
mentioned
they
got
six
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
sorry.
well
two
of
them
in
new
york
are
not
urban,
the
western
and
the
northern.
the
northern
does
consist
of
six
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
that
mr.
general,
under
the
supervisor
whatever
file
you
have,
the
second
circuit
said
what
it
said
the
attorney
general
has
issued
in
order,
a
manual
to
all
the
judges,
down
to,
i
mean
all
of
the
prosecutors,
not
only
in
this
eastern
district,
not
only
in
the
second
circuit,
but
all
over
the
country,
so
you
accomplish
what
you
wanted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
the
only
other
thing
is
where
you
turn
lose
a
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
government's
posissue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey
did
not
say
that.
he
said
that
the
us
attorney
was.
he
says
simply
that
grand
jury
was
a
part
of
the
judicial
system.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
grand
jury
was
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
grand
jury
did
not
know
about
the
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
us
attorney
that
you
know?
