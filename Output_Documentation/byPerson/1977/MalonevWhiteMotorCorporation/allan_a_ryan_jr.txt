mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
supports
the
appellant
malone
in
this
action
and
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempted
the
authority
of
the
state
to
enact
the
minnesota
pension
act.
the
law
of
preemption
is
largely
judge
made
but
its
constant
touchstone
is
the
presumed
intent
of
congress.
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear.
it
was
expressed
in
the
disclosure
act
of
1958
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
that
act
required
that
the
financial
operations
of
pension
plans
be
made
public
but
congress
said,
and
i
quote,
“we
leave
to
the
states,
the
detailed
regulations
relating
to
insurance,
trusts
and
other
phases
of
the
pension
plans
operations.”
and
quoting
again,
“this
legislation
by
design
endeavors
to
leave
regulatory
responsibility
to
the
states.”
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that,
mr.
justice
white,
because
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
could
in
effect
provide
that
any
pension
plan
written
in
this
state
must
have
a
termination
insurance
program.
so
i
would
answer
that
question,
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
it
could
under
the
scheme.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
the
retroactivity
question
of
the
minnesota
legislation
is
not
before
the
court
now.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
is
retroactive
indeed
but
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
minnesota
can
pass
the
statute
and
impose
its
terms
on
the
parties
is
not
before
this
court
except
for
the
preemption,
the
supremacy
clause
argument.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
in
an
industrial
sense,
yes
they
might
be
called
the
part
of
wages
but
that
is
to
say
no
more
than
if
congress
sets
a
minimum
wage
of
two
dollars
and
says
the
states
can
go
higher
then
minnesota
could
certainly
say
the
minimum
wage
in
this
state
is
three
dollars
and
it
could
require
the
parties
to
start
with
three
dollars.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
congress
has
said
in,
i
believe,
it
is
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
congress
has
said
the
states
can
go
higher.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
congress
has
said,
in
the
disclosure
act,
in
the
pre
erisa
days,
congress
said,
and
the
states
can
regulate
pension
plans.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
it
includes
everything
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
said
states
may
regulate
pension
plans.
and
we
think
that
the
disclosure
act
supports
the
conclusion
that
that
includes
the
ability
of
the
state
so
say
the
pension
plan
shall
be
at
a
certain
level
of
benefits
and
so
forth.
it
does
not
include
the
state
saying
that
there
shall
be
no
pension
plans
or
the
state
saying,
there
must
be
a
pension
plan
because
that
is
under,
in
steel,
that
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
and
the
state
cannot
say
otherwise.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
cannot
set
aside?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
are
some
things.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
believe
before
erisa
that
would
be
a
permissible
state
regulation
because
i
believe
the
disclosure
act
does
not
address
that,
therefore
it
is
one
those
thing
that
congress
left
to
the
states.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
it
would
be.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
absent
the
disclosure
act,
that
is
not
you
position,
mr.
justice,
white.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
even
without
the
disclosure
act,
we
would
say
that
regulatory
responsibilities
lie
in
the
first
instance
with
the
state.
and
this
is
where
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
despite
that
the
state
would
have
the
power?
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
one
respect
when
it
said
in
effect
that
the
states
have
only
the
power
that
the
disclosure
act
of
1958
gave
to
them.
we
think
the
opposite
is
the
case.
the
state
had
plenary
power
except
what
the
disclosure
act
took
away
from
them
and
except
for
interfering
with
the
doctrine
under
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
would
think
that
that
is
probably
a
matter
where
the
states
would
be
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
so
the
answer
would
be
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
i
think
in
this
case,
congress
left
regulatory
responsibility
of
pension
plans
to
the
state.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
following
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
years
between
that
act
and
1958
when
the
disclosure
act
was
passed,
i
think,
it
would
have
been
a
nice
question.
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
question.
i
think,
in
1958
and
from
then
until
1974,
congress
made
it
an
easy
question.
they
said
specifically
we
leave
regulatory
responsibility
in
this
area
of
pension
regulation
to
the
states.
in
1974,
they
took
it
away.
but
at
least
in
those
16
years
if
not
before,
the
states
had
the
power
to
do
this.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
is
too
close
to
--
well,
perhaps
i
speak
too
soon.
if
as
we
assume,
the
states
can
set
a
minimum
wage
higher
than
the
federal
wage
and
i
think
that
is
true
and
congress
has
specifically
said
so
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
then
i
misspoke.
there
would
be
no
problem
in
the
state
saying,
the
minimum
wage
in
this
state
is
whatever
the
federal
index
is
plus
2%
or
whatever
they
choose
to
do.
the
states
do
have
the
power
in
the
wage
area
to
set
a
higher
minimum
wage
that
the
federal
minimum
wages.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
normally
it
would,
yes,
certainly.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
is
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
state
act
that
speaks
only
to
collectively
bargained
agreements
and
not
to
others?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
on
those
facts
i
would
say,
no,
because
then
you
are
not
talking
about
a
minimum
wage,
you
are
talking
about
a
worker
who
might
be
earning
$20,000
a
year
is
still
entitled
to
a
6.3%
increase
this
year.
and
that
is
not
a
minimum
wage
provision
and
that
is
preempted
by
the
nation
labor
relations
act.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
in
our
view,
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
would
not.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
of
preemption,
even
if
it
was
statewide.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
because
it
would
be
preempted
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
there
is
an
explicit
provision.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
suppose
there
were
no
fair
labor
standard
act
at
all?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
no,
the
question
that
i
was
answering,
i
misunderstood
you,
was
that
if
there
were
no
provision
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
saying
the
states
can
go
higher.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
did
your
question
assume
there
is
a
federal
minimum
wage
or
no?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
there
is
no
federal
minimum
wage.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
see.
there
is
no
federal
minimum
wage
can
the
state
of
minnesota
impose
a
minimum
wage
on
its
own?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
a
difficult
question,
i
must
say.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
a
case
that
says
the
state
cannot
affect
the
end
result
of
the
bargaining
process?
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
think,
and
i
do
not
have
the
citations
but
i
believe
there
are
cases
if
not
from
this
court
then
from
lower
ones
which
uphold
the
authority
of
the
states
to
set,
for
example
lighting
requirements
or
sanitary
standards,
things
of
that
nature.
i
do
not
have
the
citations
but
i
think
it
is
that
police
power
exception
if
you
will
or
the
health
and
welfare
exception
which
we
think
is
the
wellspring
from
which
the
1958
act
comes
in
this
case.
we
think
that
’58
act
fits
in
very
comfortably
with
the
history
congress
had
demonstrated
intent
to
preserve
to
the
states
their
health,
welfare,
safety
and
police
power.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
our
position
mr.
justice
white.
and
i
think
the
disclosure
act
i
would
say
as
augmented
by
the
legislative
history
of
erisa.
we
think
those
go
hand
in
hand
but
that
is
our
position
that
this
court
in
this
case,
need
not
paint
the
entire
canvass
if
you
will
of
the
health,
welfare
exception
to
preemption.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
unless
the
court
disagrees
on
the
disclosure
act
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
disclosure
act
and
erisa
is
not
persuasive
evidence
on
this
point.
we
believe
it
is
very
persuasive.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
to
pass
in
1974,
a
statute
saying
the
minimum
wage
is
'x'
dollars
per
hour
as
of
1964.
and
everyone
who
did
not
earn
it
in
that
10
year
period
is
now
entitled
to
it
retroactively.
i
think
there
are
substantial
contract
clause
problems
presented
by
that
situation.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
my
inclination
would
be
to
say
that
they
presumptively
could
do
that.subject
to
whatever
other
arguments
may
be
made
on
the
other
side
and
by
that
i
mean,
i
would
start
off
by
saying
the
setting
of
minimum
wages
is
an
aspect
to
state’s
police
power.
whatever
problems
may
be
presented
by
doing
it
retroactively
would
certainly
have
to
be
contended
with.
but
i
would
start
by
saying
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
i
preface
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell,
by
saying,
yes.
but
aside
from
contract
clause
problems
and
there
may
well
be
other
problems
but
i
would
start
off
by
saying
the
states
can
do
it.
i
may
say,
we
are
convinced
otherwise,
that
is
an
aspect
of
their
police
power
or
health
and
welfare
power
or
whatever
you
choose
to
term
it.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
well,
the
short
answer
to
that
is,
i
would
agree
that
the
court
could
if
it
wanted
to
reach
the
result
propounded
by
the
aflcio.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
--
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
yes.
yes
it
is.
my
point
was
that
the
question
of
whether
minnesota,
assuming
it
is
empowered
to
act
at
all
on
this
area
could
act
in
this
particular
way
is
not
before
the
court.
the
contract
clause
questions,
the
due
process
questions
and
so
forth,
i
believe
all
sides
have
stated
separately.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
ryan,
jr.
which
is
the
fact
in
this
case.
