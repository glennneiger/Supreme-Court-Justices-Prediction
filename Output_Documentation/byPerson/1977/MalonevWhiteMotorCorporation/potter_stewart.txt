in
order
to
find
the
content
and
nature
and
contours
of
a
promise,
you
look
to
see
what
the
promise
was
and
this
was
in
writing,
available
for
anybody
to
inspect.
there
is
no
claim
here.
is
there
that
the
white
motor
did
not
keep
its
promise
to
anybody?
as
that
promise
is
spelled
out
in
the
pension
plan
which
was
the
product
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
specific
promises
in
the
written
agreement
which
justice
stewart
is
referring
to
that
white
is
not
living
up
to?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
do
not
want
to
look
at
all
the
promises,
because
the
promise
says,
but
we
do
not
need
to
do
that
beyond
the
certain
point
if
certain
things
happen.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
promise
that
is
being
breached
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
statute
is
changing
the
contract
the
parties
made?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
contract
clause
claim
made
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
has
not
been
resolved?
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
quarrels
about
the
thought
that
a
state
could
make
a
criminal
offense
to
embezzle
these
funds
or
even
to
impose
preventive
procedures
to
prevent
misuse
of
these
funds
and
so
on
but
that
is
not
--
this
is
changing
the
substantive
terms
of
it
which
is
quite
different
from
regulating,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
a
compulsory
subject
of
bargaining,
do
you
think,
under
the
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
federal
law
is
that
you
do
not
force
parties
to
come
to
an
agreement,
you
have
not
bargain
it
out
and
the
state
is
in
effect
saying
you
got
to
bargain
about
this,
you
must
have
one
result.
there
is
one
thing
you
cannot
agree
to.
you
cannot
agree
to
a
no-pay
termination.
justice
potter
stewart
can
the
state
put
on
a
minimum
wage?
justice
potter
stewart
contrary
higher
that
the
bargain
for
wage?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
it
said
this
about
pension
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
subtle
though,
is
it
not
that
the
process
of
bargaining
takes
place
against
the
background
of
existing
state
and
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
for
example,
a
state
law
requires,
the
banks
have
certain
minimum
deposits
and
so
on,
collective
bargaining
cannot
change
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
state,
although
a
collective
bargaining
might
be
perfectly
valid
and
in
other
state
it
did
not
have
such
a
law.
