justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
your
state
did
forbid
a
pension
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
provide
a
pension
plan
unless
it
provides
for
no
cancellation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
even
though
pension
payments
might
be
a
whole
part
of
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said
that
but
you
are
just
saying
that
means
almost
everything
including
termination
dates,
level
obtainments.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
do
you
think,
your
submission
is
at
least
it
is
very
clear
that
there
are
some
things
the
state
can
do
that
the
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
can
agree
not
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some
things,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
beyond
that
even
without
the
disclosure
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
is
a
mandatory
subject
to
collective
bargaining
and
even
though
the
labor
law
policy
is
not
to
force
agreements
on
the
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say,
despite
that
the
state
would
have
the
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
the
national
labor
relations
act
might
have
taken
away
from
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
collective
bargaining
systems?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
is
what
was
mr.
justice
stevens
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
same
question
this
case
presents,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
case
close
to
that
except
oliver?
oliver
is
like
that
but
what
other
case
says
that
a
state
cannot
affect
the
end
result
of
the
bargaining
process
as
opposed
to
the
process
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
cannot
dictate
what
terms
the
parties
may
agree
upon.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
first
submission
as
you
do
not
need
to
reach
these
tough
questions
because
of
the
disclosure
act
that
congress
has
expressly
said
state
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
disagree
with
you
on
the
disclosure
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
have
to,
then
we
get
in
the
oliver
territory
and
this
question
you
are
debating
with
justice
stevens.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ryan,
i
understand
that
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
a
state
may
set
a
minimum
wage
higher
than
the
federal
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
could
do
that
retroactively,
say
for
10
years?
it
required
employers
to
pay
additional
wages
for
10
years
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
body's
agreement,
it
had
in
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
case
to
this
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
believe
it
is
based
in
it,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
preemption
is
there
--
there
is
no
reason
why
we
could
not
consider
the
question
of
preemption
only
in
so
far
as
this
state
law
impacted
upon
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
fact
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
thank
you!
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1974,
the
state
of
minnesota
adopted
a
statute
that
in
important
ways
regulated
the
vesting
and
funding
of
pension
plans,
including
those
plans
that
were
the
result
of
collective
bargaining.
statute
also
had
important
consequences,
financial
consequences
when
a
company
would
seek
to
terminate
a
plan.
when
the
state
sought
to
apply
the
statute
to
the
respondent,
white
motor
company,
the
company
sued,
claiming
that
the
state
statute
was
invalid
because
or
could
not
be
applied
because
it
was
preempted
by
the
federal
labor
laws
insofar
at
least
as
the
statute
would
purport
to
override
or
control
the
terms
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
the
district
court
sustained
the
state
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
company
was
right
in
it's
preemption
claim.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
because
the
case
fell
within
our
mandatory
appellate
jurisdiction.
we
now
in
turn
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
although
in
a
later
statute
congress
made
it
clear
that
this
kind
of
statute
is
preempted,
it
may
not
be
applied.
at
the
time
that
the
state
passed
it's
law
and
at
the
time
it
sought
to
apply
the
statute
to
the
respondent,
it's
clear
to
us
that
congress
had
not
intention
of
the
labor
laws
being
so
applied
as
to
prevent
the
action
in
which
the
state
sought
to
take.
we
have
stated
our
reasons
at
some
length
and
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
and
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined
with
the
chief
justice
had
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinions.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
