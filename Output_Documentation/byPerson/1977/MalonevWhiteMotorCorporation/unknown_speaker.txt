unknown
speaker
well,
the
terms
of
the
pension
plan
were
in
writing
and
were
available
for
anybody
to
see,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
more
than
one,
more
than
one
additional
obligation,
it
has
eliminated
their
requirement
at
age
40
need
to
be
reached
and
it
added
to
requirement
that
these
be
full
faced
in
credit
plans
and
it
is
prohibited
the
company
from
terminating
and
all
three
of
those
are
terms
additional
to
the
pension
plan
that
was
negotiated,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
pay
the
deal
money.
unknown
speaker
you
can
terminate
the
plan
but
you
have
to
pay
up
as
though
it
were
not.
unknown
speaker
is
that
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
a
supremacy
policy
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
which
we
know
we
would
reach
first.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
state
could
have
said
they
are
awfully
sorry
but
nobody
may
adopt
a
pension
plan?
unknown
speaker
and
could
they
say
nobody
can
adopt
a
pension
plan
unless
our
director
of
labor
consents?
unknown
speaker
or
could
they
say
everybody,
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
must
contain
a
pension
plan.could
the
state
say
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
allyn,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
oliver
case?
unknown
speaker
the
independent
argument
based
on
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
leave
the
states
--
but
putting
that
to
one
side
is
there
any
distinction?
unknown
speaker
it
is
minimal,
$70,000,000?
unknown
speaker
i
think
tenure
for
the
submission
also
is
absent
the
disclosure
act,
there
would
be
preemption.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
suppose
there
were
no
fair
labor
standards
act
at
all?
unknown
speaker
having
in
mind
the
impact
on
collective
bargaining
agreement
already
negotiated.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
contract
clause
problems,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
would
cover
a
situation
arguably,
a
situation
such
as
my
brother
rehnquist
has
described
and
certainly
a
situation
such
as
this
assuming
this
for
a
trucking
company
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
provided
that
it
was
the
duty
of
all
drivers
to
do
their
best
to
drive
at
a
constant
speed
of
60
miles
an
hour.
and
then
the
state
had
much
later
but
during
the
existing
existence
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
reduced
the
speed
limit
to
55
miles
an
hour.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
about
preemption.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
local
safety
and
health
--
unknown
speaker
anybody
can
call
anything,
anything.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
they
could
picket
the
bank
but
they
could
not
change
the
state's
requirements
for
reserves?
