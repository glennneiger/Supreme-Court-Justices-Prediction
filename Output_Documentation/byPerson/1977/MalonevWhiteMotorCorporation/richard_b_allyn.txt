mr.
richard
b.
allyn
mr.
allyn
is
just
fine
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
and
counsel.
white
motor
today
asked
you
do
apply
your
doctrine
of
labor
law
preemption
to
strike
down
a
state’s
statute,
a
statute
which
you
have
given
affect
would
to
some
large
extent,
make
sure
that
about
1200
or
so
retirees
of
a
plant
that
has
been
shut
down
get
their
pension
benefits.
now,
we
believe
our
statute
should
not
be
preempted
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
congress
has
specifically
empowered
the
state
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
pensions.
secondly,
we
believe
if
you
apply
your
standard
and
traditional
case
analysis
where
congress
is
silent
that
our
statute
will
pass
muster.
and,
finally,
we
believe
that
this
limited
statute
falls
within
that
area
where
the
states
may
regulate
under
their
police
power
to
look
out
for
the
health
and
welfare
of
their
citizens.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
exceeded
10
minutes
of
my
argument
to
counsel
for
the
united
states
who
will
address
especially
this
last
issue
and
i
will
try
to
make
sure
i
watch
my
clock
accordingly.
this
case
is
commenced
in
federal
court
up
at
minnesota
in
front
of
judge
olsap
in
1975.
he
ruled
that
the
state’s
statute
was
not
preempted.
the
three-judge
panels,
eight
circuit
disagreed
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
today.
if
i
may
say
at
the
outset,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
before
you
today
is
whether
or
not
a
state
can
regulate
pension
plans
so
as
to
ensure
that
retiring
workers
get
their
primus
pensions
not
withstanding
that
the
regulation
disregards
a
provision
of
collectively
bargained
pension
plan
which
would
permit
an
employer
to
escape
its
pension
liability.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
those
issues
are
not
here
today,
question
to
due
process,
contract
clause
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
are
still
down
below,
your
honor.
although,
a
companion
case
that
is
pending
before
you
for
consideration
on
whether
or
not
to
take
jurisdiction
did
pass
upon
constitutional
issues
other
than
preemption.
that
is
called
the
fleck
v.
spannaus
and
in
that
case
the
three-judge
panel
ruled
that
the
statute
did
pass
constitutional
muster
under
these
other
theories.
i
would
like
to
describe
for
you
briefly,
but
can
the
act
it
is
here
under
attack,
it
is
called
the
minnesota
private
pension
benefit
protection
act.
i
am
going
to
call
it
the
pension
act
for
short.
it
was
adopted
in
april
of
1974
by
the
minnesota
legislature
about
4-and-a-half
months
before
ferisa
was
adopted,
the
federal
employees
retirement
income
security
act
that
is
very
important.
it
was
designed
to
eliminate
two
of
the
most
common
errors
that
or
problems
that
have
cropped
into
the
pension
plans,
guaranties
the
workers
for
years.
one
is
pension
plans,
it
create
impossibly
difficult
vesting
provisions
and
secondly,
underfunding
of
the
pension
plan
and
then
disclaiming
liability
when
they
terminate
the
plan.
now,
to
me
the
difficult
vesting
problem,
the
state
said
that
if
a
person
works
for
their
company
with
a
pension
plan
for
10
or
more
years,
they
at
least
qualify,
their
service
starts
to
qualify
account
to
the
pension.
to
meet
the
second
problem,
underfunding
and
liability
disclaimers,
the
statute
set
up
this
system
and
said
that
the
company
wants
to
go
out
of
business.
they
are
to
notify
the
commissioner
of
labor
industry
of
minnesota.
and
he
in
turn
conducts
an
investigation
to
find
out
what
those
pension
obligations
were
and
whether
or
not
there
is
enough
money
in
the
pension
plan
to
meet
those
obligations.
he
then
notifies
the
company
as
to
something
called
the
pension
funding
charge
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
money
the
company
did
set
aside
and
the
amount
of
money
needed
to
meet
the
pension
obligations
as
they
appear
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
i
am
speechless
and
cannot
answer
that.
i
had
not
contemplated
that
might
that
in
the
light
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think,
my
experience
of
the
constitutional
law
is
that
some
constitutional
provisions
protect
corporations
and
some
do
not.
i
know
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
the
fourth
amendment
does.
i
guess
i
am
not
prepared
to
knowledgeably
answer
that
and
i
apologize
to
the
court.
now,
what
happens
is
the
commissioner
of
labor
industry
pre-notifies
the
company
this
amount
of
money,
the
company
is
supposed
to
go
out
and
purchase
annuities.
and
these
annuities
are
nothing
more
than
an
insurance
policy
are
bond
which
when
it
pays
off
or
pay
off
on
a
monthly
basis,
the
amount
of
pension
benefit,
the
employee
would
have
got
under
the
terms
of
the
pension
plan.
the
minnesota
statute
does
not
set
up
a
benefit
level.
now
one
of
the
critical
features
of
this
act,
and
of
course
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit
is
our
statute
makes
the
company
liable
for
its
pension
promises.
pension
promises
cannot
be
disclaimed
by
staying,
well,
we
are
only
liable
in
so
far
as
the
amount
of
money
that
we
and
our
wisdom
decide
to
set
aside
in
the
fund.
it
is
an
important
difference
and
it
will
be
more
clearly
shown
as
we
go
on.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
i
know
of
that
specifically
tells
them
how
much
to
put
in.
the
pension
plan,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
an
adjunct
if
you
will,
a
separate
department
from
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
promise
to
pay
the
pension
is
in
the
pension
plan.
the
benefit
level
is
in
the
pension
plan.
these
other
rights
are
in
the
pension
plan
but
it
is
up
to
the
company
to
determine
how
much
money
they
are
going
to
put
in
there
to
meet
that
obligations
that
they
are
incurring.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
it
is
possible
that
they
might,
no
employee
has
commenced
such
an
action.
the
reason
i
think
it
is
passed
was
this.
the
evidence
shows
that
for
22
years
that
this
pension
plan
was
in
effect,
the
rank
and
file,
the
people
out
there
in
the
machine
shop
and
what
not
believed
they
had
a
pension
plan,
acted
in
accordance,
every
few
years
there
was
a
negotiation,
benefit
levels
were
increased,
people
started
to
retire,
started
to
get
pensions.
right
up
to
within
a
week
or
two
before
this
pension
plan
was
terminated,
the
company
was
sending
letters
to
employees
telling
them
what
their
full
pension
benefits
would
be.
i
believe
there
is
at
least
an
arguable
claim
that
there
may
be
a
quasi-contract
argument
between
employee
and
perhaps
even
the
labor
union.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
but
it
is
certainly
something
we
have
given
some
thought.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
unquestionably,
we
do
not
deny
it
and
the
fact
that
the
pension
plan
contained
this
provision
that
the
company
limited
its
liability
to
the
pension
plan.
in
other
words,
you
could
not
go
against
the
other
people
and
so
on.
that
is
in
the
pension
plan
and
the
fact
that
they
could
terminate
it
anytime
was
in
the
pension
plan.
we
do
not
dispute
it.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no
question
about
it.
those
provisions
as
far
as
we
know
were
in
the
pension
plan
from
the
first
day,
when
it
was
ever
enacted
in
1950,
which
dated
the
years
the
white
motor
came
out
to
see.
so
if
there
is,
we
do
not
run
away
from
the
fact
that
our
statute
has
the
effect
of
disregarding
or
if
you
will
modify,
i
really
think
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
modifying
the
provisions
of
that
pension
plan.
and
the
way
it
modifies
it,
it
is
simply
this,
is
that,
when
the
company
expends
all
the
money
they
have
in
that
fund
to
pay
off
the
pension,
our
statute
permit
the
state
to
then
go
back
to
the
corporation
as
a
whole
and
seek
to
recover
there.
it
has
not
happen
yet
in
this
case.we
have
not
got
to
that
stage
in
the
proceedings.
i
think
an
important
point
to
make
here
is
that
erisa,
employee
retirement
income
security
act,
it
is
on
the
court,
there
are
arguments
about
this
law
before
came
along
about
4-and-a
half
months
later
and
in
effect
has
preempted
our
statute.
our
statute
went
out
of
effective
existence
as
to
future
matters,
january
1,
1975
so
we
are
in
a
peculiar
one
time
only
situation
here.
there
is
no
dispute
either
that
erisa’s
protection
does
not
apply
to
what
is
going
on
in
this
case.
turning
to
the
facts,
minneapolis
malone(ph)
company
was
a
resident
of
minnesota
for
many,
many
years,
a
farm
implement
manufacturing
company
starting
in
about
1950,
the
hourly
workers
in
the
plant
had
a
pension
plan
and
when
white
motor
purchased
the
company
in
about
1963,
the
pension
plan,
labor
agreement
and
so
on
were
taken
over
an
have
continued
ever
since.
it
is
the
1971
pension
plan,
that
is
that
issue
here.
there
has
not
been
a
new
and
negotiated
since
then.
now,
their
plan
does
provide,
as
i
have
said,
a
few
things
that
are
different.
there
is
one
other
difference
and
that
is
they
would
say
that
employee
does
not
vest
unless
not
only
works
10
years
but
also
has
to
be
40
years
of
age.
i
would
argue,
now,
that
is
different
on
our
statute.
our
statute
says
10
years
employment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
our
evidence
the
number
of
people,
well,
in
this
case
that
are
affected
by
that
is
tiny.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
and
i
would
like
to
just
state
this
before
we
move
on
to
how
the
dispute
came
to
this
court
that
the
pension
plan
through
the
years
was
used
to
track
and
keep
highly
qualified
and
hardworking
workforce.
and
secondly,
that
it
was
used
by
the
company
to
keep
wage
increases
depressed
evidence
is
un-rebutted
and
it
is
in
the
appendix.
so,
i
am
going
take
issue
right
now
on
something
that
eight
circuit
said
and
that
is
that
well
perhaps
employees
got
higher
wages
in
return
for
not
putting
money
in
the
pension
plan,
it
is
just
exactly
the
opposite.
there
is
evidence
here,
people
worked
for
the
company
for
33
or
so
years,
the
timekeepers,
i
recall
and
his
top
salary
when
he
retired
was
$10,000.00.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
every
term
presumably
is
subject
to
negotiation.
now,
what
happened
has
here
in
1972
is
that
the
company
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
alright,
your
honor,
what
our
statute
has
affected
in
doing,
saying
that
company
must
live
up
to
the
pensions
that
they
have
been
promising
for
all
these
22
years.
the
bulk
of
the
pension
plan
is
a
pension
plan.
it
is
not
an
escape
clause.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
there
is
not
question
that
white
motor
wants
to
live
up
to
its
promise
to
get
out
when
it
wanted
to,
that
is
true.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
provisions
that
they
are
asking
to
activate.
they
are
not
living
up
to
the
promise
to
pay
a
pension.
they
are
not
living
up
to
a
promise
to
pay
a
certain
level.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
well,
if
you
will
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
under
my
view
of
the
facts,
yes,
the
part
they
are
not
living
up
to
is
the
pension
promise,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
pension
plans
says
if
you
work
for
so
many
years,
you
come
to
retire,
a
benefit
level
is
computed
based
upon
all
the
numbers
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
the
statute
has
the
effect
of
disregarding,
if
you
will,
term
of
the
collectively
bargain
pension
plan
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
it
has
not
been
resolved
in
this
case
and
a
similar
case
that
has
been
resolved
as
far
as
the
district
court,
three-judge
panel
and
they
resulted
against
the
company.
but
let
me
address
what
the
chief
justice
i
believe
is
getting
at,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
the
answer
is
it
has
added
an
additional
obligation
so
i
do
not
mean
defensibly,
i
am
trying
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
your
honor,
it
did
not
prohibit
the
company
from
terminating
the
pension
plan,
that
is
not
so.
because
statute
does
not
prohibit
them
from
terminating
the
plan
at
all.
what
it
said
was
that
when
you
terminate
the
plan
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
and
if
there
is
not
enough
money
in
the
plan,
then
you
are
going
to
look
to
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
i
must
say,
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
you
have
to
pay
up
to
the
pension
promises
that
workers
thought
was
made.
now,
the
contract
clause
issue
here
is
a
difficult
one.
i
think
we
can
establish
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no,
it
is
not
and
maybe,
i
better
avoid
it
right
now.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
now,
we
believe
we
have
come
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
you
should
in
deciding
this
case,
cited
just
before
you,
look
to
see
whether
or
not
congress
has
evidence
to
belief
to
intention
that
the
states
could
regulate
pension
plans
over
and
above
any
kind
of
contract
claim.
and
we
argue
that
the
pension
and
disclosure
act
of
1958,
plus
the
adoption
of
erisa
is
evidence
for
the
fact
that
congress
believed
that
the
states
were
free
to
regulate
the
administration
and
operation
of
pension
plans.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
well,
your
honor,
it
well
could
be
but
in
our
case
when
you
look
at
the
language
in
the
statute,
the
specific
language
to
see
what
congress
intended
and
then
match
that
to
the
kind
of
ills
and
the
problems
that
congress
was
looking
at.
it
was
underfunding.
it
was
liability
disclaimers,
difficult
vesting
provisions.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
i
think
pension
plans
are
no
doubted
compulsory
subject
to
collective
bargains.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no,
your
honor,
no,
we
do
not.
we
are
just
simply
saying
that
if
you
are
going
to
terminate
your
plan
look
out
for
those
people
that
you
have
been
making
a
promise
to
for
a
long,
long
time.
and
i
think
that
that
has
got
to
be
the
essence
of
the
operation
and
ministration
of
a
pension
plan.
if
you
do
not
put
enough
money
into
it,
what
kind
of
pension
plan
do
you
have?
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
okay,
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
remaining
few
seconds,
oliver,
i
would
believe
it
is
dramatically
different,
that
case,
the
state’s
statute
struck
down
the
heart
of
their
wage
structure.
there
is
no
question
about
it,
the
state
anti-trust
statute.our
statute
did
not
come
along
in
mandate
or
strike
down
the
heart
of
the
pension
plan.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
statute
has
effect
of
upholding
what
we
would
say
is
certainly
the
intention
of
most
of
the
people,
the
employees,
that
they
thought
and
planned
on
for
over
22
years.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
terminate,
your
company’s
got
to
look
to
its
assets
to
stand
behind
the
pension
obligations
and
you
cannot
just
escape
by
having
a
pension
fund
and
and
not
putting
any
money
on
it.
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
they
did
not
put
any
money
in
it.
there
are
some
small
benefits
now
being
payed
to
these
workers.
we
are
not
claiming
here.
they
are
a
desk
door.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
congress
has
said
it,
can
set
minimum
wages,
your
honor.
so
i
guess,
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
if
congress
says
we
can
do
it,
then
we
can
do
it.
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
that
is
where
we
are
different
from
oliver.
this
is
really
an
important
point.
at
oliver,
you
do
not
have
any
congressional
statement
to
the
state.go
ahead
and
set
up
an
anti-trust
law
to
prohibit
the
kind
of
thing
they
went
after.
in
our
state,
in
our
situation,
congress
said
in
the
pension
disclosure
act
and
in
erisa,
indirectly
that
you
can
regulate
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
well,
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
we
admit
that
our
statute
bears
a
term
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is,
in
our
judgment,
so
minimal
and
so
not
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
nlra.
we
would
ask
you
to
look
at
that
and
know
--
mr.
richard
b.
allyn
alright,
let
me
just
put
that
up,
my
time
is
up.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
since
the
$90,000,000
assessment
was
set,
the
commissioner
holds
a
hearing
and
at
that
hearing
is
for
certain
going
to
be
reduced
by
$7,000,000
which
is
the
amount
in
the
so
called
guarantee
letter
they
have
set
up.
it
is
going
to
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
money
they
have
now
put
in
at
hopkins
(ph),
their
new
plant,
new
pension
plan
in
the
plant
and
the
amount
of
money
that
has
been
paid
since
an
arbitrary
is
a
word,
our
reply
brief
addresses
this
and
it
says
it
is
going
to
be
between
six
and
eight
million
dollars.
thank
you
very
much!
i
would
like
to
cede
what
little
time
there
is
left.
