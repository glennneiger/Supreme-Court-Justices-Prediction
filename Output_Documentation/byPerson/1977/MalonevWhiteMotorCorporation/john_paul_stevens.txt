justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ryan,
assume
you
did
not
have
a
fair
labor
standard
act
to
express
recognition
of
the
stateâ€™s
power
to
set
a
minimum
wage.
you
merely
had
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
act,
could
the
state,
would
the
state
have
the
power
to
set
a
minimum
wage
higher
than
a
contract
wage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
because
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
saying,
assuming
no
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
the
state
of
minnesota
decides
a
minimum
wage
in
minnesota
is
going
to
be
five
dollars
an
hour.
and
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
have
only
reached
four
dollars
an
hour.
you
are
saying
the
state
has
no
power
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
said
that
assuming
there
is
just
no
federal
statute
at
all
on
the
minimum
wage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
federal
labor
policy
is
that
set
forth
in
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
question
that
this
case
presents,
because
--difficulty
in
that
question,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
easy
labor
preemption
question.
i
think
we
start
from
that
point.
and
in
your
hypothetical,
sir,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very,
very
difficult
question
because
you
would
have
to
go
back,
you
would
have
to
set
aside
20
years
or
30
years
of
congressional
history
and
go
back
then.
and
i
just
do
not
want
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ryan,
before
you
sit
down,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
you
know,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aflcio
in
this
case
takes
the
position
that,
first
of
all,
that
we
should
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
if
we
do
not
we
should
limit
our
decision
in
this
case
to
the
question
of
preemption
of
federal
labor
law
by
the
impact
of
these
state
laws
only
on
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
if
you
will,
the
retroactive
effect
of
the
state
law.
i
understood
you
a
moment
ago
or
a
few
moments
ago
to
say
an
answer
to
a
question
propounded
to
you
by
the
chief
justice
that
that
issue
could
not
be
decided
here.
that
that
was
not
in
this
case,
the
retroactivity
and
that
that
was
not,
did
you
mean
that
that
was
not
covered
by
grant
of
certiorari
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
heath
just
before
you
get
to
that,
i
assume
this
is
apparent
from
what
you
said
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
it
is
your
view
i
take
it
that
if
there
were
no
federal
labor,
fair
labor
standards
act,
no
minimum
federal
law,
a
state
would
not
have
the
power
to
fix
a
state
minimum
wage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
matter
of
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
a
state
have
child
labor
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
suppose
it
were
clear
that
the
state
prospectively
could
do
what
it
is
doing
here.
it
could
with
respect
to
new
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
its
action
would
not
be
preempted.
you
say
nevertheless
it
is
preempted
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
this
court
were
to
decide
that
prospectively
with
respect
to
new
agreements,
minnesota
could
do
what
it
did.
would
the
question
be
in
so
far
as
preemption
and
supremacy
clause
is
concerned,
would
the
issue
be
different
with
respect
to
passed
contracts
as
far
as
supremacy
clause
is
concerned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
yes
but
does
it
make
the
case
a
better
case
for
you
that
the
law
was
not
in
effect
when
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved
here
was
made?
does
it
make
it
better
for
you
as
far
as
the
supremacy
court
is
concerned?
