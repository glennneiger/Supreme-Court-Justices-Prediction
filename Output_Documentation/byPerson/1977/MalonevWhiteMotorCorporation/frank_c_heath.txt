mr.
frank
c.
heath
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
hear
the
argument
and
to
read
the
briefs
of
the
state
and
labor
board
as
i
call
the
other
brief,
one
would
think
that
there
are
grave
questions
of
fact
undecided
in
this
question
of
preemption.
and
that
is
not
true.
let
us
restate
the
operative
facts
that
relate
to
questions
of
preemption.
counsel
inferred
and
i
think
said
that,
well,
there
were
labor
contracts
negotiated
but
not
pension
plans
and
that
the
pension
plans
did
not
say
what
funds
had
to
be
put
in.
that
is
not
right.
all
the
pension
plans
from
the
first
pension
plan
in
1950
were
collectively
bargained.
every
amendment
to
those
plans
was
collectively
bargained.
those
plans
were
made
part
and
parcel
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
every
pension
plan
that
was
negotiated
contained
pension
schedules
and
not
as
a
separate
provision
but
as
part
of
the
contract
itself.
two
very
important
provisions
which
are
clear
and
unambiguous
and
were
not
put
in
fine
print.
one,
section
609
of
the
pension
plan,
pension
shall
be
payable
only
from
the
fund
and
rights
to
pension
shall
be
enforceable
only
against
the
fund.
and
in
a
separate
section
of
the
plan,
which
if
you
please,
was
collectively
bargained
and
negotiated
and
ratified.
neither
the
company
nor
any
trustee
or
pension
committee
or
any
member
thereof
shall
be
liable
therefore
being
payment
of
pension
benefits
in
any
manner
or
to
any
extent.
we
do
not
have
here
a
promise
and
that
the
state
would
like
to
say
a
disclaimer
of
a
promise.
and
that
is
made
clear
when
you
understand
what
pension
plans
were
like
and
the
kind
of
problem
that
arose
from
funding
the
pension
plans.
when
pension
plans
were
placed
for
the
first
time
or
when
they
are
increased,
credit
is
given
to
service
of
employees,
not
just
service
that
they
will
have
from
that
point
forward
but
services
taken
place
in
the
past,
perhaps
not
only
with
this
employer
but
with
predecessor
employers.
the
result
is
in
giving
credit
for
that,
you
get
a
paper
figure
and
i
will
explain
it
in
a
minute
that
is
called
a
past
service
liability.
it
is
a
contingent
liability
because
it
comes
into
play
only
if
the
pension
plan
continues
in
effect,
only
if
the
employee
continues
in
employment
to
qualify
for
a
full
pension
or
at
least
if
he
quits
has
enough
service
to
qualify
for
a
deferred
vested
pension.
unions
and
the
uaw
that
negotiated
most
of
these
agreements,
there
is
a
strong
experience
and
knowledge
of
all
american
union,
they
and
other
unions
recognized
that
the
only
way
to
get
agreement
on
pensions
was
to
have
a
deferred
funding
arrangement
under
which
past
service
liability,
this
credit
system,
would
be
paid
over
a
period
of
many
years.
and
that
was
provided
in
this
plan,
in
1971,
which
is
the
key
point.
the
pension
plan
by
negotiation
provided
that
these
credits
that
were
given
to
employees
for
past
service
would
be
funded
over
a
period
of
35
years,
a
long
time,
and
created
uncertainty
but
to
have
what
minnesota
has
to
create
here,
instant
funding
would
create
a
situation
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
companies,
and
they
would
not
have
agreed
the
pension
plans
because
if
they
put
a
pension
plan
in,
five
or
ten
years
later,
the
plant
and
had
a
misfortune
and
they
had
to
close
it,
they
would
have
a
liability
that
would
be
out
of
all
proportion
to
what
they
could
stand.
so
there
was
a
reason
for
deferred
funding
which
was
common.
now,
with
that
background,
what
was
the
situation
in
1971?
as
i
have
said,
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
company,
the
union
being
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
all
these
employees.
there
was
an
agreement
for
35
year
funding
which
i
have
just
described.
the
union
knew
in
1971
that
during
the
three
year
period
from
’69
through
’71,
this
farm
division
of
white
motor
has
lost
$
21,000,000.
the
uaw
being
knowledgeable
also
was
aware
of
the
fact,
that
the
plan
was
far
from
fully
funded
and
in
that
situation,
although
the
company
already
had,
before
’71,
an
agreement
that
we
will
put
in
so
many
dollars
each
year
to
fund
this
over
a
long
term.
the
union
came
in.
this
is
a
great
example
of
collective
bargaining.
the
union
came
in
and
said
we
are
concerned.
we
want
to
bargain
with
you
about
guaranteeing
pensions,
if
the
plant
is
closed
and
the
plan
is
terminated
and
that
is
what
the
very
pension
guarantee
that
was
negotiated
in
1971
says
and
that
is
on
page
172
and
173
of
the
appendix.
it
expressly
provides
for
just
that
circumstance
and
the
union
in
the
circumstances
when
you
consider
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
company
that
was
suffering
the
losses
did
a
remarkable
job
because
they
obtained
from
white,
an
agreement
in
addition
to
its
funding
obligations
that
if
to
unfortunate
circumstances,
this
plant
were
closed,
white
would
guarantee
pensions
at
a
certain
level
which
actually
as
the
record
shows
produced
an
additional
obligation
of
$7,000,000.
what
white
agreed
to
guarantee
were
pensions
for
years
of
service
with
white
itself
at
the
level
provided
in
the
1968
plan
and
agreement
and
lower
pensions
for
years
of
service
with
prior
employment.
that
was
a
situation
in
1972,
the
unfortunate
circumstances
resulted
in
the
closing
of
the
plant.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
terminated
in
1974,
the
company
has
honored
all
of
its
commitments
and
the
suggestion
that
there
are
lurking
in
the
background
contract
actions
is
simply
not
so.
that
is
simply,
i
am
sorry
an
attempt
to
create
facts
that
are
different
from
what
we
have
here.
what
the
state
did,
in
this
where
retroactivity
clearly
comes
into
preemption.
the
state
has
said
time
and
again
and
it
is
in
their
brief,
we
did
not
interfere
with
your
collective
bargaining
process
in
1971.
we
let
you
go
ahead
and
make
the
agreement.
that
is
right!
but
what
they
did
in
1974,
20
days
before
the
agreement
was
terminated,
was
to
come
in
and
change
the
qualifications
for
eligibility
for
vested
pensions
imposed
on
the
company
in
the
event
of
termination
of
a
plant
immediate
payment
through
annuities
of
all
pensions
instead
of
the
limited
liability
through
deferred
funding.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
that
depends
on
how
this
court
interprets
what
is
called
as
local
interest
exception,
and
the
safety
and
health
provisions
set
forth
in
oliver.
that
could
be
preempted
perhaps
under
the
rather
tight
standards
which
seem
to
be
set
in
machinists
and
seem
to
be
set
in
the
two-bus
employee
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
strictly
on
the
language
of
oliver,
where
that
is
a
true
safety
standard.
it
could
be,
you
could
avoid
preemption
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
tell
you
precisely
where
that
point
is,
your
honors,
but
i
am
in
a
position
to
say
to
you,
that
the
safety
and
local
safety
and
health
regulation
referred
to
in
oliver
or
included
in
the
local
interest
exception
does
not
include
as
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
argued.
it
does
not
include
all
actions
taken
for
economic
welfare
of
employees
or
all
actions
taken
to
the
general
wellbeing
of
employees
because
if
so
you
wipe
out
completely
the
doctrine
of
labor
law
preemption
and
with
it
you
seriously
undermine
collective
bargaining.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
i
have
--
mr.
frank
c.
heath
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
no,
i
have
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
that
is
what
it
means.
as
i
read
the
cases,
there
may
be
some
variation
in
how
far
the
local
safety
and
health
goes,
but
it
does
not
go
to
economic
benefit
because
if
so
it
would
do
what
nobody
can
say
congress
believed
should
be
done.
it
would
wipe
out
the
preemption.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
no,
i
do
not
think
it
could.
consequently,
it
is
clear
that
we
do
have
not
only
conflict
between
the
act
and
the
negotiated
plan
but
what
can
safely
be
called
a
massive
conflict.
how
anyone
could
call
that
conflict
peripheral
contact,
as
the
state
calls
it,
i
am
sorry,
it
is
beyond
me.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
and
make
others
believe
it,
mr.
justice,
that
is
my
point.
there
is
that
conflict.
clearly
then,
we
have
the
next
question,
does
the
labor
law
protect
negotiated
agreements,
negotiated
pension
plans
against
that
conflict?
and
it
does.
and
this
is
where
retroactivity
comes
in.
the
state
acted
retroactively
and
says,
well
we
did
not
interfere
with
the
process
all
we
did
is
changed
your
contract.
and
even
though
we
too,
we
think
that
that
would
also
raise
and
we
have
pleaded
that
it
raises
a
contract
question.
the
plain
fact
is
it
also
raises
a
question
which
is
clearly
covered
by
labor
law
not
only
oliver
but
the
cases
that
preceded
oliver
under
the
railway
labor
act.
it
said
expressly
that
the
labor
agreement
negotiated
under
that
act
which
has
the
same
promotion
of
collective
bargaining
theory
as
a
labor
law
has
the
imprimatur
of
federal
law
upon
it
and
cannot
be
amended
or
vitiated
by
the
laws
of
a
state.
hanson
said
it.
taylor
said
it.
this
court,
well,
the
issue
was
not
up,
this
court
repeated
that
conclusion
in
insurance
agents
said
there
has
to
be
no
interference
of
the
state.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
both
are
being
protected,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
not
any
question
and
the
courts
have
said
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
collective
bargaining
process
is
protected
but
you
cannot
get
out
from
under
by
waiting
until
the
collective
bargaining
process
is
finished
and
the
bargain
is
made
because
part
of
the
obligation
to
bargain
under
the
act,
under
section
8d
as
i
recall
it,
you
are
not
only
must
bargain
collectively
but
if
requested
and
you
reach
an
agreement,
you
must
put
that
bargain
in
writing.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
no,
it
does
not
and
actually
there
was
other
interference.
there
were
negotiations
that
took
place
in
1975
where
the
presence
of
the
act
interfered
with
it
but
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
labor
law,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
we
believe
protects
both
the
process
of
bargaining
and
the
bargain
made
and
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
only
one
is
protected.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
of
course
it
does.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
no.
broadly
speaking
i
suggest
--
mr.
frank
c.
heath
what
you
say
is
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
is
always
the
condition
that
the
state
law
must
be
one
of
a
type
that
is
not
preempted.
now
there
has
been
talked
here
about
wage
in
our
law.
the
wage
in
our
law
when
passed
was
quite
specific
as
to
what
states
could
do.
we
have
other
laws,
aflcio
points
out
all
these
other
laws
and
how
they
point
out
on
the
one
hand
very
careful.
congress
has
been
to
say
exactly
what
states
can
or
cannot
do
in
the
substantive
area,
then
they
jump
a
great
gap
and
say
that
having
been
the
case
in
the
disclosure
act,
they
did
that
and
they
did
not
do
that
in
the
disclosure
act
and
let
me
talk
briefly
about
that
if
i
may.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
that
is
right,mr.
justice
stevens.
and
i
think
that
was
held
by
this
court
in
1914
in
the
early
railroad
case
--
mr.
frank
c.
heath
as
a
matter
of
preemption
that
is
all
i
am
talking
about
is
preemption.
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
probably
only
if
authorized
as
they
are
by
the
wage
and
hour
act,
although
there
you
might
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
fall
into
a
health
and
safety
exemption
but
except
for
that,
no.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
the
basis
for
it
was
to
have
a
very
limited
exception
of
the
type
which
had
been
historically
recognized
and…
mr.
frank
c.
heath
well,
under
the
railway
labor
act
for
instance,
there
were
safety
laws
and
there
have
been
for
many
years,
a
states,
usually
the
industrial
commission
of
the
state,
may
set
expressed
provisions
of
what
safety
devices
must
be
used
here
and
there
on
machines.
and
that
kind
of
law
had
been
in
effect.
i
can
only
believe
and
assume
that
that
is
what
was
meant
in
oliver.
actually,
this
court
in
restating
the
local
interest
exception
as
it
did
in
machinists
perhaps,
stated
so
tightly
that
it
would
be
less
broad
than
in
oliver.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
the
case,
the
decision?
mr.
frank
c.
heath
yes,
i
think
it
is
your
honor
for
the
purpose
for
which
i
read
it.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
and
let
me
say
this,
i
have
not
talked
about
it
here
but
the
suggestion
that
oliver
has
viability
only
when
you
are
talking
about
the
anti-trust
laws
simply
does
not
have
any
validity
because
the
decisions
which
oliver
followed,
hanson
and
taylor
were
not
anti-trust
cases.
and
when
this
court
in
machinists
and
earlier
in
insurance
agents
said
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
we
will
not
let
a
state
interfere
with
the
substantive
solution
of
collective
bargaining.
they
were
not
talking
about
anti-trust
law,
so
i
do
not
think
oliver
is
limited
in
that
sense.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
well
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
limitation
which
the
aflcio
has
put
on
oliver
here.
although
we
are
glad
that
except
for
the
argument
as
to
disclosure
act
which
we
do
not
think
is
very
meaningful,
they
agree
with
us
that
what
was
done
here
is
an
intolerable
interference
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
no,
in
oliver
for
instance,
oliver
was
dealing
with
an
ohio
anti-trust
law
the
valentine
act
which
has
been
in
effect
in
ohio
since
the
early
teens
as
i
recall
it.
so
the
fact
that
it
was
in
effect
before
does
not
matter
and
as
i
recall
in
hanson,
the
nebraska
constitution
prohibiting
co-shops
had
been
on
effect
before
and
perhaps
even
in
taylor,
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
heath
i
think
it
creates
a
more
gross
situation.
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
difference
but
arguably
if
you
had
a
statute
that
was
already
in
effect,
you
could
bargain
around
it
if
you
please.
and
let
me
say
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
makes
a
very
good
point
that
that
would
be
intolerable
interference
because
if
you
have
to
spend
all
of
your
money,
the
money
you
had
available,
to
satisfy
the
statute
of
a
state
with
respect
to
one
fringe
benefit,
the
union
could
come
in
and
say,
well
we
do
not
want
that
fringe
benefit
we
would
rather
have
longer
rest
periods.
we
would
rather
have
some
holiday.
we
do
not
want
that
particular
benefit.
and
then
there
would
be
material
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
bargainable
subject.
i
think
that
is
outside
the
realm
of
what
you
would
need
to
bargain
on
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
yes,
they
can
say
that
they
may
not
like
that.
i
think
the
employees
to
their
union
have
a
right
to
say
we
do
not
care
what
reserves
you
keep.
we
think
you
keep
too
much
but
whether
you
keep
those
reserves
or
not
we
want
more
dollars
but
i
do
not
think
they
can
say
we
demand
that
you
keep
lower
reserves.
i
think
that
is
outside
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining
and
perhaps
i
am
getting
far
a
few
from
the
case
here
but
i
think
--.
mr.
frank
c.
heath
that
is
my
feeling,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
say,
if
i
have
a
few
minutes,
comment
briefly
on
the
pension
disclosure
act
argument,
i
think
there
has
on
its
face
a
little
weight.
but
it
can
be
demonstrated
to
be
invalid,
because
aflcio
seems
to
say
something
a
little
different
which
may
be
as
even
less
validity
but
relying
upon
the
language
that
congressmen
and
senators
used
in
the
pension
disclosure
act
debate.
we
are
going
to
leave
to
the
states
their
traditional
functions,
functions
related
to
operation
and
administration.
aha,
says
the
state,
that
means
that
that
they
can
change
the
terms
of
pension
agreements
because
says
the
state,
it
is
not
necessary
to
cede
that
power
to
them
and
the
state
expressly
says
that
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
9,
the
state
did
not
need
to
cede
anything.
all
they
had
to
do
with
leave
to
the
states,
the
power
that
it
had
and
that
does
not
make
sense.
the
day
before
the
pension
disclosure
act
what
was
the
situation?
railway
labor
act
had
been
in
effect
for
a
long
time.
national
labor
relations
act
was
in
effect,
this
court
had
articulated
the
principal
of
labor
law
preemption
clearly
in
hanson
and
taylor
and
talked
about
the
imprimatur
of
federal
law
protecting
contracts
and
so
at
that
day
before
the
disclosure
act,
there
was
not
any
right
on
the
part
of
a
state
to
change
a
collective
bargaining
agreements
whether
it
is
in
pensions
or
otherwise.
they
did
not
have
that
right
then.
because
if
they
had
that
right
labor
law
preemption
is
gone
again,
it
is
undermined
because
if
the
day
before
the
pension
disclosure
act,
it
the
state
could
have
said
we
are
going
to
dictate
the
terms
of
pension
agreements,
they
could
say,
we
are
going
to
insist
if
you
please
as
the
minimum
that
you
give
everybody
30
minutes
of
every
hour
off
so
that
our
employees
in
our
state
are
well
rested.
we
are
going
to
give
everybody
a
five
weeks
vacation
and
those
examples
also
proved,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
no
magic
in
simply
saying
all
we
are
doing
is
setting
minimums
because
by
setting
minimums
you
can
destroy
collective
bargaining.
if
you
say
everybody
must
have
30
minutes
an
hour
off
and
five
weeks
of
vacation
after
they
have
been
there
one
year,
this
is
going
to
impose
burdens
if
it
were
valid,
burdens
on
a
employer
that
would
be
intolerable
and
the
employer
would
say,
well
if
i
have
to
bear
those
burdens,
if
that
were
valid,
if
i
had
to
bear
those
burdens,
i
cannot
assume
other
burdens.
so
on
its
face
we
think
that
the
pension
disclosure
act
does
not
do
anything,
to
give
the
state's
power.
it
does
not
cede
power
to
them
and
it
did
not
have
the
power
to
act
in
this
way
before
the
pension
disclosure
act.
thank
you.
