justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
would
not
be
making
that
argument
if
the
federal
law
had
clearly
said
that
the
states
could
not
pass
this
certain
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
not
challenging
the
constitutionality
in
any
substantive
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
constitutional
right
to
travel
extends
to
corporations
or
just
the
persons?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
an
employee
have
had
an
individual
contract
right
against
white
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
promise
contained
in
the
pension
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
consented
too
by
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
workers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
that
could
be
answered,
yes
or
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
referring
to
some
specific
provision
in
the
written
pension
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
state
could
pass
a
law
saying
that
any
wages
bargained
for
in
a
collective
bargaining
unit
agreement
have
to
be
paid
the
day
after
they
are
earned,
regardless
of
any
provisions
of
the
country
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
there
and
not
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
thought,
your
argument
did
not
depend
on
the
history
of
the
withholding
act,
it
was
just
the
plenary
powers
that
state
had
not
been
removed
by
the
withholding
act,
by
the
disclosure
act.
certainly
congress
had
ever
even
addressed
itself
to
the
subject
when
wages
should
be
paid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
under
other
collective
bargaining
agreement
there
had
been
extensive
provisions
in
assuming
the
company
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
coal
mining,
extensive
provisions
for
maintaining
the
safety
of
the
mine
that
had
been
agreed
to
in
the
process
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
1971,
and
three
years
later,
the
state
of
minnesota
enacts
a
provision
that
is
much
more
stringent
and
that
provided
for
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
would
that
in
you
view
be
preempted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
stronger
in
the
case
of
an
agreement
already
negotiated
in
a
prospective
agreement?
i
would
think
what
is
being
protected
is
the
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
argument
only
gets
your
past
agreement
up
to
your
present
negotiation.
it
does
not
elevate
it
above
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
is
the
basis
for
the
health
and
safety
exemption
if
it
does
not
extend
to
some
other
aspects
of
traditional
police
power
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
historically
recognized
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
oliver
seem
crystal
clear
to
you
when
reading
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
a
lot
of
people
could
say
that
with
different
clients
than
yours.
