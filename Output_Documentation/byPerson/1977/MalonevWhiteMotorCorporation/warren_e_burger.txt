chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
malone
against
white
motor
corporation.
mr.
allyn
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
excuse
me,
in
minnesota,
i
must
address
you
as
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
employersâ€™
contributions
meet
the
requirements
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
not
the
terms
of
this
pension
agreement
open
to
collective
bargaining
every
time,
the
collective
bargaining
contract
expired?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
how
do
you
escape
the
proposition
that
the
minnesota
statute
has
intervened
and
implanted,
engrafted
on
to
the
collective
bargaining
contract
a
new
dimension?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
three
of
us,
the
last
three
questions
are
all
directed
at
the
same
proposition
and
as
the
statute,
as
the
minnesota
legislature
engrafted
a
new
term
or
provision
on
the
contract
,
n
collective
bargaining
contract.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
these
are
all
provisions
agreed
to
by
both
of
the
negotiating
parties
to
the
contract,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ryan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
it
provide
that
any
pension
plan
in
the
state
must
provide
at
least
60%
of
the
wages
earned
in
the
last
three
years
of
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
withstanding
a
prior
agreement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
an
act
passed
now.
that
is
what
we
have
an
act
passed
long
after
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
setup
a
pension
plan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
pretty
retroactive,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
be
one
example
that
the
state
law
would
require
that
no
official
in
the
union
be
a
trustee
of
the
pension
fund?
and
that
no
official
of
the
company
be
a
trustee
that
it
must
be
a
neutral
and
independent
trustee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
regulation
without
any
substantive
change,
however,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
state
legislature
provide
that
the
minimum
increase
each
year
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations
must
be
equal
to
--
must
reflect
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
cost
of
living?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
did
not
go
to
minimum
wages.
it
goes
only
to
the
annual
negotiations
at
which
time
the
labor
act
certainly
guarantees
the
employer
the
right
to
say
no
increase
at
all,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
normally?
not
always?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all.
simply
saying
that
the
employer
now
has
a
right
surely
under
the
labor
law
to
say
i
am
very
sorry
business
is
very
poor
we
cannot
give
you
any
increase
this
year,
you
agree
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
he
then
listens
and
takes
part
in
bargaining
in
the
usual
way?
but
you
said
the
legislature
could
come
along
and
say
the
starting
point
is
6.3
because
of
the
percent
increase
because
that
is
what
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
designated
as
the
increase
in
cost
of
living.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up,
mr.
ryan.
mr.
heath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
state
could
not
have
lesser
standards
that
the
federal
alliance
safety
act,
could
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
bank
employee
said,
we
would
much
rather
you
do
not
keep
all
these
reserves
that
the
state
banking
law
requires,
we
want
higher
wages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
bargain
about
wages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
malone,
commissioner
of
labor
and
industry
for
minnesota
against
white
motor
corporation
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
