unknown
speaker
where
is
page
121?
unknown
speaker
yes,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold,
in
that
same
vein,
were
all
of
these
compacts
listed
in
supplement
c
at
121
actually
submitted
to
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
the
many
uniform
laws
fall
within
compact?
unknown
speaker
i
expect
what
i
am
really
getting
at.
do
you
suppose
that
in
these
several
lists,
we
have
an
exhaustive
list
of
everything
that
would
fall
within
the
definition?
unknown
speaker
there
must
be
many
other
types
of
agreement
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
mr.
griswold?
how
many
of
these
compacts
has
this
court
struck
down
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
griswold,
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
i
take
it.
is
all
or
almost
all
of
the
matters
that
you
go
through
in
your
brief
that
you
presented
here
with
respect
to
impact
in
the
record
or
throughout
it
is
all
subject
to
judicial
notice,
i
do
not
know,
but
one
of
your
questions
that
you
presented
here
was
whether
the
case
should
be
decided
on
summary
judgment.
but,
you
never
developed
that
in
your
brief
at
all.
you
simply
prefer
us
to
decide
whether
you
should
have
had
summary
judgment
instead
of
the
other
party.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
require
us
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
things
the
district
court
has
never
dealt
with.
unknown
speaker
what
about
agreements
that
might
encroach
upon
the
supremacy
of
the
united
states
which
might
not
tend
to
increase
the
political
power
of
the
states,
or
do
you
think
that
any
agreement
that
tends
to
encroach
would
intend
to
increase
the
political
power
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
really,
that
is
the
test?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
show
encroachment
you
need
not
to
go
on
and
show,
separately,
increase
in
political
power.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
griswoldâ€™s
argument
in
the
light
of
what
you
just
said
about
encroachment
in
respect
of
the
pending
treaty?
unknown
speaker
was
your
motion
for
summary
judgment
ever
opposed
on
the
grounds
that
there
were
still
factual
matters
to
be
resolved?
unknown
speaker
in
that
respect,
i
suppose
you
are
arguing
that
this
puts
it
in
the
same
category
as
the
commission
on
uniform
state
laws
that
each
member
can
take
it
or
leave
it.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
all
so
simple,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
it
approved
by
congress,
could
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
would
tell
us
why
this
problem
my
give
difficulties
with
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
whether
it
is
in
the
record
or
not
you,
in
representing
the
commission,
must
know
what
it
would
be.
it
certainly
would
not
be
the
lack
of
it.
