mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
question
involved
is
the
constitutional
validity,
particularly
under
article
1
section
10
but
also
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
clauses
of
the
constitution
of
the
multistate
tax
compact
and
of
the
appellee,
the
multistate
tax
commission,
which
administers
the
compact.
the
text
of
the
multistate
tax
compact
is
set
forth
at
pages
54
through
79
of
the
white
bound
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
may
say
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
really
contained
in
two
documents,
the
papers
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
that
includes
the
text
of
the
multistate
tax
compact
at
pages
54-79
and
then
the
brown-covered
appendix
in
which
we
did
not
undertake
to
reprint
those
things
which
had
already
been
put
before
the
court.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought,
21
states
were
members
of
the
compact.
since
that
time,
four
states:
illinois,
florida,
wyoming,
and
indiana
have
withdrawn
from
the
compact
while
two
states:
california
and
south
dakota
have
joined
in.
thus,
there
are
now
19
states,
members
of
the
compact.
the
basic
question
arises
under
article
1
section
10
of
the
constitution
and
the
language
which
i
am
sure
would
have
seemed
clear
to
mr.
justice
black
that
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
enter
into
any
agreement
or
compact
with
another
state.
the
simple
fact
is
that
congress
has
never
given
its
consent
to
the
multistate
tax
compact
though
that
compact
went
into
effect
by
its
terms
when
seven
states
had
joined
it
on
august
4th,
1967
now
more
than
10
years
ago.
as
indicated
by
the
references
on
page
10
of
our
main
brief,
the
blue-covered
brief,
the
consent
of
congress
has
been
sought
repeatedly
but
has
never
been
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
it
has
ever
gotten
out
of
any
committee
nor
been
passed
by
either
house.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
has
never
been
voted
down.
the
consent
has
never
been
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
has
ever
dealt
with
that
question.
i
can
only
say
that
congress
has
dealt
with
it
in
100-150
incidences
and
has
ratified
compact
from
which
a
state
could
withdraw.
certainly,
the
practical
construction
is
that
that
is
the
practical
construction
by
the
legislative
branches,
that
that
is
a
compact
within
the
meaning
of
the
article
1
section
10.
the
three-judge
district
court
held
that
the
consent
of
congress
was
not
prerequisite
to
the
validity
of
this
compact.
it
also
found
no
merit
in
the
commerce
clause
and
due
process
clause
arguments.
accordingly,
it
granted
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellee.
an
appeal
was
taken
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
february
22.
beyond
the
apparent
clarity
of
the
constitutional
language,
we
rely
on
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
provision.
this
substance
is,
i
think,
given
meaning
by
the
long
continued
practice
of
congress
and
the
states
in
giving
effect
to
the
constitutional
provision.
in
order
to
put
that
practice
before
the
court,
we
have
included
two
rather
lengthy
appendixes
in
our
main
brief.
this
is
the
somewhat
dark
blue
brief.
these
appear
at
pages
53
through
120
of
the
blue-covered
brief.
the
first
of
these,
beginning
on
page
53,
lists
in
chronological
order
every
compact
to
which
congress
has
given
its
consent
from
the
beginning
through
the
year
1976.
these
are
listed
by
title
and
with
our
statutory
citations,
there
are
something
like
150
of
them.
i
may
say
that
on
page
53,
there
are
a
number
of
typographical
corrections,
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to.
in
the
first
place,
the
first
compact
listed:
virginia
and
kentucky
compact
and
the
second
and
third
from
the
last
one
listed:
virginia
and
west
virginia
debt
agreement,
virginia
and
west
virginia
boundary
agreements
of
1866.
i
do
not
think
they
are
compacts
at
all
and
i
think
we
should
not
have
listed
them.
the
first
one
is
the
act
admitting
kentucky
to
the
union
and
the
second
and
third
from
the
bottom
are
two
acts
connected
with
the
admission
of
west
virginia
to
the
union.
in
the
second
supplement,
we
have
reprinted
a
list
compiled
by
the
council
of
state
governments
in
a
publication
which
it
put
out
in
1966.
this
lists
the
compacts
up
to
that
time
in
alphabetical
order.
to
some
extent,
it
duplicates
the
list
which
we
have
in
the
first
supplement.
but,
the
second
list
also
gives
additional
information,
particularly
a
list
of
references
to
the
states
which
are
parties
to
the
several
compacts.
as
i
have
said,
it
only
goes
through
1866
since
we
were
reprinting
it
from
another
publication
we
did
not
feel
free
to
make
insertions
of
the
additional
ones.
but,
the
compacts
to
which
congress
has
given
its
consent
since
1966
are
set
out
in
chronological
order
on
pages
68
through
70
of
the
first
supplement.
finally,
we
have
included
on
page
121,
a
list
derived
from
the
council
of
state
government’s
publication
showing
the
compacts
which
were
an
operation
in
1966
which
had
not
received
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
after
the
blue
slip.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
some
of
these
compacts
may
be
invalid
for
the
lack
of
that
consent.
i
would
mention
particularly
the
southern
regional
education
compact
which
was
in
its
origin
and
effort
to
getting
around
this
court’s
decision
in
the
games
case
involving
the
education
of
a
negro
outside
of
missouri,
when
missouri
maintained
a
law
school
for
white
students
exclusively.
the
house
passed
a
joint
resolution
of
consent.
the
senate
debated
it
extensively
over
a
period
of
several
days
and,
eventually,
voted
to
recommit
the
bill
by
a
vote
of
38:37.
after
a
suggestion
had
been
made
that
adaption
of
the
consent
resolution
would
amount
to
an
approval
by
congress
of
the
segregation
which
was
implicit
in
the
compact.
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
western
regional
education
compact
was
consented
to
by
congress
in
1953
only
five
years
later.
no
question
of
segregation
was
involved
there.from
this
listing,
it
appears
that
congress
has
given
its
consent
to
a
wide
range
of
compacts
between
the
several
states
and
that
it
has
given
its
consent
to
a
very
high
proportion
of
the
compacts,
more
than
90%,
which
have
been
put
into
operation.
many
of
the
compacts
which
congress
has
consented
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
page
which?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
council
of
state
governments.
it
represents
the
same
point
of
view
which
is
represented
by
the
appellees
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
my
opinion.
we
have
reprinted
here
this
list
from
the
publication
on
interstate
compacts
put
out
by
the
council
of
state
governments
in
1966
simply
because
we
thought
it
would
be
convenient
for
the
court
and
certainly
without
endorsing
those
statements.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
simply
reprinting
the
listing
made
by
council
of
state
governments.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
does
and
it
also
suggests,
i
think,
that
the
time
has
come
when
this
court
should
clarify
when
it
is
necessary
to
submit
compacts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that,
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
i
do
know
that
the
southern
regional
education
compact
was
submitted
to
the
congress.
i
do
not
know
whether
any
of
the
others
were
and,
in
fact,
i
am
sure
that
the
inter-pleader
compact
was
not,
because
i
remember
working
with
professor
chaffee
and
the
development
of
that
compact.
that
is
an
agreement
for
opening
up
jurisdiction
of
courts.
conceivably,
it
should
have
been
submitted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
question
that
uniform
laws
are
not
compacts.
they
can
be
enacted
and
repealed
at
will.
it
becomes
a
little
more
difficult
when
you
get
reciprocal
legislation.
this
statute
shall
go
into
effect
with
respect
to
any
state
which
passes
a
similar
statute.
but,
i
do
not
have
any
real
trouble
with
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
each
state
is
free
to
withdraw
though
perhaps
with
the
conditions
of
notice
or
things
of
that
kind
and
being
bound
as
to
actions
taken
while
it
was
in
effect.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
think
making
an
exhaustive
list
is
extraordinarily
difficult.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
these
are
simply
the
compacts
which
were
listed
in
that
publication
of
the
council
of
state
governments.
this
court
has
dealt,
to
some
extent,
with
uniform
laws
it
has
made
passing
references
that
they
do
not
come
within
the
compact
clause
and,
in
one
or
two
cases,
with
reciprocal
legislation
particularly
with
respect
to
taxes
on
interstate
carriers.
but,
this
court
has
never
upheld
a
multistate
compact
involving
an
administrative
agency
with
delegated
powers
from
the
states
which
has
not
received
the
consent
of
congress.
let
me
get
back
to
what
moves
the
court
below.
incidentally,
i
may
say
that
many
of
the
compacts
which
have
been
consented
to
by
congress
involved
relatively
smaller
matters
and
18
of
the
first
28
involved
two
interstate
boundary
agreements.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
ohio-pennsylvania
amendment
listed
on
page
67
of
the
brief
which
affects
motorboats
in
lake
pymatuning
and
increases
the
power
which
may
be
used
from
6
horsepower
to
10
horsepower.
the
consent
of
congress
was
sought
to
that
agreement
and
obtained.
i
would
emphasize
how
diligently
congress
has
reviewed
the
many
compacts
brought
before
it.
congress
has
often
imposed
conditions
and
restrictions,
including
time
limitations
before
granting
consent.
congress
has
refused
or
failed
to
give
consent
in
a
number
of
instances
including
this
one.
how
then
was
the
multistate
tax
compact
sustained
by
the
court
below?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
this
court
has
never
struck
down
any
compact
for
not
having
been
consented
to
by
congress,
nor
has
it
sustained
any
contract
involving
a
multistate
agreement
with
an
active
administrative
agency
having
extensive
powers
delegated
to
it
by
the
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
such
cases
have
been
presented.
take,
for
example,
the
southern
regional
educational
compact.
as
things
worked
out,
this
court’s
decision
in
other
cases
came
along
and
the
concern
about
it
disappeared
and
there
was
no
occasion
to
attack
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
the
first
clause
provided
for
multistate
financing
of
meharry
medical
school,
the
objective
being
that
that
would
then
be
a
medical
school
for
all
the
state’s
parties
and
they
could
send
their
students
there
and
not
only
be
within
the
games
case
but
have
a
congressional
enactment
which
could
arguable
be
contended
to
be
under
section
5
of
the
14th
amendment
that
that
was
a
valid
result.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
financing
of
it,
i
suspect,
is
very
complicated,
a
great
deal
of
it
being
charitable,
and
a
very
large
amount
of
it
being
federal.
but,
i
do
not
know
of
the
financing
of
meharry.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
was.
the
problem
arises
because
of
a
dictum
of
this
court
in
virginia
against
tennessee.
it
was
clearly
a
dictum
as
is
shown
in
our
briefs.
the
court
held
that
congress
had
given
its
consent
long
ago
informally
but
effectively.
having
held
that,
the
court
then
said
it
is
evident
that
the
prohibition
of
article
1,
section
10
is
directed
to
the
formation
of
any
compact
tending
to
the
increase
of
political
power
in
the
states
which
may
encroach
upon
or
interfere
with
the
justice
supremacy
of
the
united
states.
i
would
point
out
first
that
not
only
was
that
a
dictum
but
it
was
a
hard
case.
it
was
a
case
where
the
boundary
line
had
been
established
and
accepted
for
90
years.
it
involved
a
one
time,
one
place
bilateral
agreement
and
the
same
is
true
of
this
court’s
more
recent
decision
in
new
hampshire
against
maine,
a
year
ago
on
which
the
court
below
also
relied.
there,
the
boundary
was
established
in
1740
by
an
order
of
the
privy
council
in
england
more
than
200
years
ago.
the
agreement
before
the
court
was
simply
a
stipulation
to
settle
a
lawsuit
involving
a
controversy
as
to
the
exact
location
of
the
boundary
over
the
water.
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
been
easier
for
the
court
simply
to
hold
that
since
the
constitution
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
over
suit
between
two
states
that
a
stipulation
between
the
party
settling
that
case,
approved
by
the
court
was
not
a
compact
to
which
article
1
section
10
applied.
the
essential
fact,
as
i
have
said,
here
is
that
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
validity
of
a
modern
compact,i
may
say
the
modern
period
in
compact
really
begins
about
1921
with
the
colorado
river
compact,
the
port
of
new
york
authority.
since
then,
there
have
been
a
substantial
number
of
compacts
involving
multistate
agreements
with
administrative
bodies.
the
court
has
never
given
its
consent
to
a
modern
compact
involving
many
states
and
creating
an
independent
administrative
commission
to
which
congress
has
not
given
its
consent.
indeed,
since
almost
all
compacts
have
sought
and
obtained
the
consent
of
congress,
few
questions
covering
the
validity
of
compacts,
lacking
congressional
consent
have
reached
this
court.
the
cases
which
have
come
here
have
all
involved
one
time,
one
place
bilateral
boundary
agreements
and
have
virtually
no
application
to
a
wide-ranging
multistate
agreement
such
as
that
now
before
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
they
were,
mr.
justice.
again,
i
think
that
really
does
not
make
any
difference
because,
as
long
as
they
are
joined
together,
the
compact
has
an
impact.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
i
would
like
to
answer
that
in
part
by
reading
a
sentence
from
the
third
annual
report
of
the
multistate
tax
commission.
the
multistate
tax
compact
is
like
all
compacts,
making
it
possible
for
states
to
accomplish
cooperatively
that
which
they
cannot
do
separately.
this
is
really
an
instance.
i
hate
to
use
it
because
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
states
have
been
conspiring
but
that
the
law
of
conspiracy.
three,
four,
or
five
people
joined
together
to
do
something
and
it
was
recognized
300
years
ago
that
that
has
impact
above
and
beyond
what
anyone
of
the
individual
parties
might
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is
a
crime.
i
am
suggesting
that
when
states
joined
together,
they
are
doing
something
above
and
beyond
what
is
done
by
each
of
the
individual
states.
a
great
many
of
the
compacts
which
have
been
submitted
to
by
congress,
many
of
them
approved,
some
of
them
with
qualifications
and
conditions
and
time
limits,
and
some
disapproved
have
been
involved
in
advisory
arrangements.
this
is
an
agreement
with
a
clout.
this
compact
provides
that
the
multistate
tax
commission
has
subpoena
powers
and
that
those
subpoenas
may
be
enforced
by
the
courts
of
any
state
which
is
a
member
of
the
compact.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
be
violating
the
law.
the
law
of
its
legislature
provides
that
it
shall
enforce
the
subpoenas
of
the
multistate
compact.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
be
reversed
by
a
state
supreme
court.
i
do
not
suppose
there
would
be
a
federal
question
so
it
would
be
hard
to
bring
it
here.
i
think
it
might
well
be
regarded
as
a
support
and
that
is
unfortunate
and
will
go
on
to
the
next
case,
but
the
law
is
clear
that
the
courts
of
the
states
which
are
members
of
the
compact
shall
enforce
subpoenas
against
a
resident
of
their
state
issued
by
the
multistate
tax
compact.
i
am
also
reminded
of
an
experience
i
had
with
general
hershey.
i
tried
to
get
him
to
do
something
and
he
said
“i
do
have
no
power
to
do
that.
all
i
can
do
is
to
recommend.”
of
course,
there
was
nothing
that
was
more
emphatic
than
a
recommendation
from
general
hershey.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
a
quotation
from
an
article
which
is
cited
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
relating
to
the
interstate
compact
on
oil
and
gas.
this
is
an
article
by
leech
cited
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
with
respect
to
that
compact
which,
incidentally,
has
been
approved
by
congress
always
with
time
limitations,
always
with
requirements
for
report
to
congress,
and
more
recently
with
requirements
that
there
would
be
reports
to
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
anti-trust
implications.
leech
says
“legally,
it
has
no
power.”
actually,
it
is
the
most
powerful
and
respected
agency
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry.
i
say,
here,
that
the
multistate
tax
compact
has
an
impact
discussed
at
greater
length
in
our
brief
and
that,
in
the
language
of
justice
frankfurter
and
james
m.
landis
who
wrote
the
great
article
in
this
field
back
in
1925,
this
is
something
where
congress
should
exercise
its
judgment.
they
wrote
in
this
article
in
the
yale
law
journal,
historically
the
consent
of
congress
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
validity
of
agreements
by
state
superiors
as
the
republican
transformation
of
the
needed
approval
of
the
crown.
but,
the
condition
plainly
had
two
very
practical
objectives
in
view,
in
conditioning
agreement
by
states
upon
consent
of
congress.
for
only
congress
is
the
appropriate
organ
for
determining
what
arrangements
between
states
come
within
the
permissive
class
of
agreement
or
compact,
even
the
permissive
agreements
may
affect
the
interests
of
states
other
than
those
parties
to
the
agreement.
the
national
and
not
merely
a
regional
interest
may
be
involved.
here,
there
is
a
very
clear
national
interest
involved
as
is
evidenced
by
the
pending
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom,
the
avoidance
of
double
taxation
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom,
which
contains
a
provision
insisted
upon
by
the
united
kingdom
and
a
number
of
other
countries
are
also
concerned
with
it
preventing
the
use
of
one
of
the
practices
of
the
multistate
tax
commission
called
combination.
it
is
a
little
like
consolidated
return,
only
it
is
much
broader
than
that.
we
have
gone
into
it
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
the
chairman
of
the
multistate
tax
commission
has
appeared
before
the
senate
committee
on
foreign
relations,
an
opposition
to
that
provision
of
the
treaty.
the
task
force
on
foreign
income
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
has
recommended
that
this
provision
be
held
inapplicable
in
foreign
taxation
and
a
recommendation
has
been
made
to
the
president
that
this
be
included
in
his
current
tax
program.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
clearest
possible
illustration
of
the
fact
that
the
activities
of
the
multistate
tax
commission
do
impinge
upon
the
powers
and
authority
of
the
united
states
and
that
they
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
be
put
into
effect
unless
and
until
the
compact
has
obtained
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
whether
the
case
should
have
been
decided
against
us
on
summary
judgment
was
a
point
which
we
wish
to
preserve
and
so
we
raised
it
in
our
question
presented.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
did.
we
wanted
to
avoid
having
somebody
say
“you
never
raised
that
question.”
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
council
has.
we
did
raise
in
the
district
court
towards
the
end,
the
question
that
in
view
of
the
compact
clause,
the
summary
judgment
should
go
for
the
plaintiffs
and
our
position
here
is
that
all
of
the
material
or
is
material
of
which
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
such
as
this
reference
to
the
treaty
with
great
britain
which
is
pending
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
now
and
the
citations
are
given.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
requirement
that
the
court
do
that.
i
think
that
there
is
plenty
of
material
in
the
record
so
that
the
court
can
hold
that
this
multistate
compact
setting
up
an
administrative
commission
with
subpoena
power,
enforcement
power,
power
to
make
regulations
is
one
which
is
covered
by
the
compact
clause
and
cannot
be
put
into
effect
without
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
first.
it
is
an
instance
of
how
this
commission
pays
no
attention
to
the
compact.
the
compact
provided
expressly
that
each
state
shall
have
one
vote.
california
came
in
on
condition
that
nothing
should
be
passed
unless
there
was
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
population
of
the
states.
that
gave
california
almost
a
veto,
not
quite,
but
california
and
two
or
three
other
states
can
veto
and
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
that
is
the
reason
why
indiana
withdrew.
the
annual
reports
of
the
commission
make
it
plain
that
the
genesis
of
the
compact
was
to
head
off
federal
legislation
with
respect
to
taxation
of
interstate
businesses.
in
other
words,
in
its
very
origin,
its
purpose
was
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
federal
power.
reference
has
been
made
to
uditpa,
the
uniform
division
of
income
for
tax
purposes
act.
uditpa
provides
for
allocation
of
non-business
income.
but,
the
commission
by
its
regulations
provides
that
virtually
all
non-business
income
shall
be
apportioned.
here
again
as
several
commentators
cited
in
our
brief
have
shown
the
commission
paid
simply
no
attention
to
the
law.
you
can
say
“it
only
has
recommend
their
mandatory
power”
but
it
recommends
to
the
states
that
they
proceed
this
way
and
they
do
proceed
that
way
as
is
evidenced
by
an
item
in
the
record
where
the
commission
recommended
to
a
number
of
state
that
they
make
arbitrary
assessments
against
corporations
which
did
not
comply
with
the
actions
of
the
state
commissioners
and
that
this
would
be
a
means
of
bringing
about
their
capitulation.
i
would
like
to
refer
particularly
to
an
opinion
by
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
in
a
letter
by
him.
in
our
brief,
we
have
mistakenly
said
the
attorney
general.
he
was
later
attorney
general.
but,
when
he
wrote
the
letter
he
was
deputy
attorney
general
dealing
with
the
great
lake’s
compact
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
merely
because
it
was
advisory
did
not
mean
that
it
could
have
impact
on
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
have
limped
along
too
long
on
virginia
against
tennessee.
it
is
time
for
the
court
to
bring
the
compact
clause
into
the
modern
age.
