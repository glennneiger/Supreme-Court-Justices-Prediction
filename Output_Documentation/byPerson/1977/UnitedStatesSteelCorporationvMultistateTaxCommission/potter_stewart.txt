stewart
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
mr.
griswold,
excuse
me.
you
just
mentioned
that
southern
regional
education
compact
and
you
told
us
that
it
may
be
that
several,
if
not
all,
of
the
compacts
that
have
not
received
congressional
approval
that
are
listed
on
page
121
supplement
c
of
this
brief
may
be
invalid.
then,
i
looked
at
page
111
which
is
i
guess
appendix
b
of
this
brief,
supplement
b
to
this
brief.

justice
potter
stewart
111,
just
to
cross-refer
to
the
southern
regional
education
compact
and
i
noticed
that,
as
stated
there,
congressional
consent
not
required.
whose
judgment
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
your
submission.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
question.
it
says
“congressional
consent
not
required,”
but
you
are
not
submitting
that
here.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not
that
some
of
the
financing
of
meharry
medical
college
in
nashville
goes
through
that
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
that
medical
school
is
still
operating
and
it
is
still
financed
in
that
same
way,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
which
attorney
general’s
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
the
state
courts
have
followed
that
decision?
