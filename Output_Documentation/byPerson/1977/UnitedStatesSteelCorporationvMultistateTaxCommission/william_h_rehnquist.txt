justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
had
occasion
to
address
the
question
of
whether
an
agreement
from
which
a
state
could
withdraw
at
any
time
was
a
compact
within
the
meaning
of
the
clause
you
are
relying
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
griswold,
does
that
not
suggest
though
that
perhaps
compacts
may
be
submitted
for
ratification
where,
in
the
opinion
of
the
submitting
state,
ratification
may
not
be
required
but
they
just
do
it
in
an
excess
of
caution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
each
of
those
two
in
the
latter
category
you
refer
to,
mr.
griswold,
the
tennessee-virginia
and
new
hampshire-maine
were
irrevocable
compacts,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
curious
though
as
to
what
consequences
are
visited
upon
your
client
by
the
existence
of
this
agreement
that
could
not
be
equally
well
visited
upon
them
by
similar
legislation
in
the
party
states
separately
adapted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
joined
together
to
audit
your
corporationâ€™s
tax
returns.
that
is
no
crime.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
your
organization
that
is
planning
to
enter
into
a
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
that
is
inconsistent
with
some
provision
of
a
federal
treaty,
i
take
it
missouri
versus
holland
would
invalidate
that.
