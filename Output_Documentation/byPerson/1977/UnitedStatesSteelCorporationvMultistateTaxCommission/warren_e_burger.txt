but
even
that
is
revocable,
is
it
not?
each
of
the
states
under
reciprocity
is
still
free
to
withdraw.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
they
just
did
not
come
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
we
did
not
sustain
any.
is
that
because
there
were
none
presented?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
state
refused
to
execute
that
particular
provision?
what
would
happen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
it
be
expelled
from
the
compact
by
the
other
signatories?

mr.
dexter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
power
would
not
necessarily
go
somewhere.
if
it
left
the
federal,
it
would
not
just
go
in
limbo.
would
it?
it
would
be
bound
to
flow
into
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
any
of
them
have
subpoena
power?
chief

e.

mr.
dexter,
is
there
anything
in
the
record,
i
take
it
there
is
not,
as
to
why
these
states,
that
withdrew,
withdrew?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
allowed
your
friend
to
go
a
couple
of
minutes
over.
do
you
care
to
respond?
there
would
be
about
two
minutes
available,
mr.
griswold.
yes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
consumes
your
additional
time,
mr.
griswold.

e.
burger

you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
