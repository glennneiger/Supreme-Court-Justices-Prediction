mr.
william
d.
dexter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
several
issues
and
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
mr.
griswold,
the
argument
that
i
think
needs
to
be
clarified
and
clarified
immediately.
the
first
issue
is
the
one
that
is
implicit
in
listing
compacts
or
agreements
which
have
been
approved
by
congress
and
the
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
multistate
tax
compact
was
submitted
to
congress.
first,
it
should
be
realized
that
two
states
in
asking
for
admission
to
the
compact
and
enacting
the
compact
specifically
made
provision
in
their
admission
legislation
for
congressional
approval.
congressional
approval
needed
to
be
sought
on
that
ground.secondly,
it
certainly
was
a
matter
of
expediency
to
do
so,
but
the
attorney
general’s
opinion,
the
opinions
of
counsel
to
the
commission
clearly
indicated
that
under
the
virginia
versus
tennessee
test
which
have
been
the
controlling
test
for
a
number
of
years,
no
congressional
consent
was
not
required.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
attorney
general
of
washington
and
the
attorney
general’s
opinion
of
illinois.
those
were
two
opinions
that
were
issued
and,
there,
they
indicated
that
congressional
consent
was
not
required.
they
looked
at
the
provisions
of
the
compact
in
light
of
the
history
and
language
of
the
test
to
be
employed
to
determine
its
constitutionality
of
virginia
versus
tennessee
and
decided
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
a
compact
or
agreement
which
needed
congressional
consent.
we
simply
say
that
the
fact
that
compacts
are
submitted
to
congress
for
congressional
consent
are
a
matter
of
political
expedience.
for
instance,
the
great
lakes
basin
compact
which
the
appellants
refered
to
in
their
brief,
which
was
submitted
to
congress
finally
for
consent,
the
statement
in
the
congressional
record
regarding
that
consent
simply
says
that
in
view
of
the
dispute
concerning
the
necessity
for
the
compact
it
seems
clear
that
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
secure
congressional
consent
rather
than
to
forego
consent
and
thereby
throw
a
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
compact
and
on
the
commission’s
activity.
i
submit
that
the
taking
and
throwing
together
all
of
the
compacts
that
congress
has
approved
and
then
telling
this
court
that
that
is
the
constitutional
test,
that
is
what
the
compact
means
under
the
constitution
is
not
appropriate.
we
rather
believe
that
the
appropriate
test
to
determine
the
validity
of
a
compact
including
the
compact
in
question
is
to
look
at
the
judicial
history
concerning
that
compact
clause.
in
virginia
versus
tennessee,
it
is
true
that
the
language
of
justice
field
was
dicta.
it
is
also
true
that
he
went
at
great
lengths
to
explain
and
understand
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
the
compact
clause
in
the
united
states
constitution.
he,
in
that
decision,
laid
down
a
test,
a
standard
by
which
that
clause
could
be
interpreted.
it
was
a
test
for
all
time.
it
was
a
test
for
all
kinds
of
compact.
then,
in
that
decision,
he
went
ahead
and
applied
that
test
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
compact
in
question.
this
court
in
new
hampshire
versus
maine
followed
exactly
the
same
procedure.
the
first
question
is
what
does
the
compact
clause
mean?
not
in
the
context
of
a
boundary
dispute
but
in
the
context
of
the
constitution.
this
court,
there,
referred
to
the
virginia
versus
tennessee
test
and
simply
gave
the
compact
clause
that
interpretation
and
then
turned
around
and
applied
it
to
the
boundary
agreement
there
involved
and
found
no
congressional
consent
was
required.
since
virginia
versus
tennessee,
the
state
courts
have
uniformly
followed
that
test.
that
test
simply
is
whether
or
not
a
compact
increases
the
political
power
of
the
states
in
a
manner
which
tends
to
impinge
or
encroach
upon
just
federal
supremacy.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
state
courts,
your
honors,
have
followed
that
decision
and
several
of
the
decisions
are
put
forth
in
our
brief.
in
fact,
the
early
case
in
1854
of
union
branch
railroad
co.a
georgia
case
cited
in
our
brief,
actually
ended
up
with
the
same
kind
of
standard.
it
simply
said
that
the
compact
clause
did
not
mean
all
agreement.
it
meant
those
political
types
of
agreements
which
would
tend
to
interfere
or
encroach
upon
federal
supremacy.
i
think
that
that
decision
may
well
have
influenced
the
decisions
of
justice
field
in
virginia
versus
tennessee.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
would
think
that
any
encroachment
would
tend
to
increase
the
political
power
of
the
state.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
there
are
some
cases
where
this
court
has
upheld
an
increase
of
the
power
of
the
state.
for
instance,
reciprocal
legislation
such
as
that
approved
by
this
court
in
port
of
new
york
versus
o’neill,
359
us
1,
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
and
i
have
not
put
in
my
brief.
in
that
case,
the
court
recognized
that,
by
reciprocal
legislation
which
was
in
the
nature
of
an
agreement,
each
court
was
really
extending
its
enforcement
powers
cooperatively
by
agreement
in
other
states.
under
that
case,
this
court
upheld
the
expedition
of
a
witness
from
florida
to
new
york
in
a
criminal
proceeding
as
a
result
of
reciprocal
legislation.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
i
think
the
fact
of
encroachment
is
a
tantamount
to
indicating
that
the
states
are
trying
to
interfere
or
encroach
upon
federal
supremacy.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
it
would
have
to
flow,
your
honor,
to
the
state.
that
is
right.
do
we
think
this
is
the
standard
that
this
court
should
apply
in
this
case?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
there
is
exchange
of
information
agreements
between
the
state
and
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
there
is
exchange
of
audited
information
and
so
forth.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
i
think
that
if
an
agreement
by
the
states
to
exchange
tax
information
is
valid,
basically,
the
compact
does
very
little
more
with
the
joint
audit
program.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
in
the
first
place,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
provision
of
the
multistate
tax
compact
that
has
anything
to
do
with
combined
reporting.
the
only
substantive
income
tax
provision
there
is
contained
in
article
3
and
4.article
3
grants
the
taxpayer
two
options.
it
permits
a
taxpayer
with
a
minimal
presence
and
sales
in
a
state
to
use
a
simplified
form
of
reporting.
all
multistate
taxpayers,
under
article
3,
have
a
right
to
apportion
or
allocate
their
income
as
an
option
in
accordance
with
article
4
of
the
compact.
article
4
contains
the
language
of
the
uniform
division
of
income
for
tax
purposes
act.
that
language
has
to
do
with
the
division
of
income.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
combined
reporting
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
compact,
there
is
no
rule
or
regulation
the
commission
has
ever
issued,
there
is
not
audit
that
has
ever
been
conducted
by
the
commission
that
touches
upon
the
subject
matter
in
the
united
kingdom
treaty.
i
think,
we
explained
that
very
definitely
in
our
brief.
it
is
simply
a
red
herring
to
pull
in
the
uk
treaty
and
indicate
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
compact.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right,
and
the
compact
does
not
mentioned.
article
9
for
the
compact
would
prevent
the
states
from
including
a
foreign
united
kingdom
parent
in
a
combined
return
with
the
us
domestic
subsidiary.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
there
is
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
but,
the
treaty
has
enacted,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief
that
it
does.
that
practice
which
is
state
practice
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
compact
would
have
obviously
to
be
changed.
the
united
kingdom
treaty
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
compact
or
what
has
been
done
in
reference
to
its
administration.
i
would
like
to
indicate
that
this
case
was
here
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
requires
what
they
call
a
9g
statement.
in
that
statement,
the
party
moving
for
a
summary
judgment
has
to
set
forth
what
he
believes
to
be
the
undisputed
facts
in
the
cause.
we
did
that.
the
appellants
came
back,
did
not
deny
anything
that
was
set
forth
there.
those
statements
in
the
9g
statement
of
the
appellee
are
in
contra
verdict.
it
should
further
be
indicated
to
this
court
that
both
the
three-judge
court
below
and
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
the
hertz
case
found
that
what
the
appellants
were
arguing
for
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
compact
on
its
face.
they
asked
that
the
compact
be
declared
void
in
toto
and
that
its
commission
be
disbanded.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
matter
of
law.
all
of
that
is
required
to
determine
the
constitutional
test
to
be
applied
under
virginia
versus
tennessee,
look
at
the
provisions
of
this
compact
and
see
whether
or
not
that
test
is
violated.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
they
argued
that
there
are
a
lot
of
factual
matters
but
the
lower
court,
in
reference
to
that
argument,
simply
said
this
“no
contention
is
made
that
the
compact
is
being
administered
other
than
according
to
its
terms.”
i
am
reading
it
from
3a
of
the
appendix
a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
“no
contention
is
made
that
the
compact
is
being
administered
other
than
according
to
its
term,
except
as
to
particulars
governed
by
the
subsidy
tax
laws
of
the
respective
party’s
statement.”
the
constitutional
issues
posed
by
this
complaint
reduced
themselves
to
questions
of
law.
certain
of
the
issues
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
raise
are
purely
hypothetical
and
speculating.
as
to
these
issues,
plaintiffs
have
not
“set
forth
specific
facts
showing
there
is
a
genuine
issue
for
trial,”
rule
56
efr.civil
procedure.
certain
other
claims
and
issues
or
fact
are
plainly
not
material
to
the
determination
of
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
arguments
raised
here.
yes,
there
was
an
argument
that
we
want
more
and
more
discovery
and
they
have
drawers
of
discovery
concerning
everything
that
anybody
can
conceivably
ever
said
or
did
in
reference
to
the
compact
including
copies
of
every
audit
that
the
commission
has
ever
made
in
(inaudible).
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is,
here,
any
question
of
what
this
is
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
compact
on
its
face.
i
would
like
to
indicate
that
article
12
of
the
compact
contains
a
severability
clause.
under
that
clause,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
appellant
to
show
what
provisions,
if
any,
of
the
compact
were
unconstitutional.
only
those
provisions
become
inoperative
under
article
12.
the
remainder
of
the
provisions
remain
in
full
force
and
effect.you
have
to
take
virginia
versus
tennessee
test
or
whatever
test
this
court
wishes
to
apply
in
interpreting
the
compact
clause
and
look
at
it
in
reference
to
each
of
the
compact
provision.
i
would
suggest
that
the
only
real
issue
in
this
clause
is
whether
or
not
the
tax
administrators
of
the
member
states
can
join
together
in
a
cooperative
audit
program
and
to
authorize
the
commission
of
which
they
are
members
to
act
as
their
auditing
agent
in
order
to
enforce
their
own
tax
law.
now,
to
understand
that
this
is
the
only
issue,
it
is
necessary
to
quickly
refer
to
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
compact.
i
have
already
commented
on
article
3
and
article
4.
those
are
optional
provisions
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayers.
they
could,
in
no
eyes,
burden
interstate
commerce
and
they
are
no
different
than
reciprocal
legislation
such
as
upheld
by
this
court
in
bode
versus
barrett
and
in
new
york
versus
o’neill
and
needs
no
further
comment.
article
5
of
the
compact
grants
certain
options
to
multistate
taxpayers
for
sales
and
used
tax
purposes.
they
are
for
the
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce.
they
are
a
benefit
to
taxpayers.
it
could
not
possible
deny
the
appellants
any
constitutional
right
and
we
believe
raise
no
serious
question.
the
powers
of
the
commission
or
this
tremendous
authority
that
the
appellants
are
referring
to
in
their
brief
are
contained
in
articles
7
and
8
and
in
paragraph
3
of
article
6
of
the
compact.
paragraph
3
of
article
6
of
the
compact
gives
the
commission
only
the
authority
to
study,
to
recommend,
and
to
issue
proposals
that
would
aid
in
the
uniform
application
and
the
relief
of
compliance
problems
in
state
and
local
tax
math.
this
advisory
and
recommends
the
authority
function
of
the
commission
is
no
different
than
discharged
by
a
merit
of
organizations
between
the
states
and
the
national
governor’s
conference,
the
national
association
of
attorney
general,
the
national
association
of
tax
administrator.
it
is
no
different
in
function
than
that
of
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws.
they
have
the
power
to
get
together
as
a
state
agency
to
recommend
uniform
laws
that
affect
the
national
interest,
i
suppose,
and
effect
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no.
the
subpoena
power
of
the
commission
is
in
article
8
and
i
would
address
that
now,
although
it
is
a
little
out
of
order
of
what
i
was
going
to
say.
the
article
8
does
grant
the
tax
commission
as
the
auditing
agent
of
a
tax
administrator
to
go
to
the
ports
of
member
states
to
enforce
that
subpoena.
this
authority
is
no
different
than
the
authority
that
each
individual
tax
administrator
has
on
his
own
account.
this
led
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
the
hertz
case
and
the
three-judge
court
below
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
ship
to
power
among
the
states
by
the
subpoena
power
and
that
there
was
no
encroachment
on
federal
supremacy.
all
that
the
commission
is
doing
is
standing
in
the
state
of
the
tax
administrator
of
each
state
as
his
agent.
it
is
true
that
article
8
of
the
compact
permits
the
commission
to
go
into
any
member
state
that
has
adapted
article
8
and
enforce
that
subpoena.
but,
it
submitted
that
this
extension
or
increase
of
state
power
is
specifically
upheld
by
this
court
in
new
york
versus
the
o’neill
case
that
the
courts
can
make
arrangements
among
themselves
and
agree
to
make
their
ports
available
to
enforce
the
laws
of
another
states.
there
is
a
whole
series
of
reciprocal
legislation
or
agreements
in
the
nature
of
reciprocal
legislation
that
the
states
utilize
for
this
purpose.
it
should
also
be
realized
that
that
provision
of
the
compact
is
severable.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
joint
audit
program.
many
of
the
subpoenas
and
court
proceedings
that
the
appellants
have
referred
to
in
their
brief,
as
of
uses
by
the
commission,
were
really
subpoenas
by
the
individual
state
courts
asking
their
courts
to
enforce
that
subpoena
that
requested
that
the
multistate
taxpayer
turn
their
books
and
records
over
to
the
commission
as
an
agent
for
audit
purposes.
it
was
state
subpoenas
that
were
used,
that
were
complained
of
in
the
appellant’s
brief.
this
is
why
we
asserted
there
that
such
allegations
did
not
involve
any
authority
or
power
of
the
commission.
but,
we
believe
even
though
the
subpoena
power
is
severable,
not
necessary
to
the
validity
or
working
of
the
join
audit
program
that
itself
has
no
constitutional
defect.
i
would
like
to
move
on.
the
other
substantive
provision
in
the
compact
is
article
7.
it
permits
the
tax
administrators
of
the
member
states
to
issue
advisory
regulations
and
form
where
state
laws
are
uniform
or
similar.
this
is
purely
an
advisory
function.
the
only
regulations
that
this
commission
has
promulgated
at
all
concern
article
4
of
the
compact
which
is
the
optional
provision.
it
contains
the
language
of
the
uniform
division
of
the
income
for
tax
purposes
act
promulgated
by
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws.
this
ability
to
issue
advisory
regulations
that
are
optional
with
the
state
is
no
different
than
the
ability
of
any
person
or
entity
whatsoever.
it
is
done
with
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws.
it
has
been
done
for
years
by
the
national
association
of
tax
administrators.
it
could
be
done
by
the
american
bar
association,
any
other
group,
or
individual
whatsoever.
it
is
purely
advisory
to
have
no
force
or
effect
until
they
are
adapted
by
the
state
and,
surprisingly,
the
only
regulation
that
the
appellants
are
complaining
about
here
has
to
do
with
an
optional
provision
under
the
compact.
therefore,
before
the
regulations
under
article
4
adapted
by
the
commission
can
be
applicable
to
appellants
two
things
must
happen.
one,
they
have
to
elect
through
apportion
or
allocate
their
income
under
article
4.
secondly,
a
state
has
to
adapt
those
regulations
as
their
own
regulation.
when
they
do,
it
becomes
their
regulation
and
not
the
advisory
regulations
of
the
commission.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
that
is
precisely
true,
your
honor.
it
has
no
more
binding
effect
than
any
recommendation
of
the
commission.
that
so-called
power
in
the
commission
is
one
of
these
great
powers
that
the
appellants
attribute
to
the
commission.
under
their
argument,
it
contains
a
lot
of
abuses,
interferes
within
the
national
affairs,
interferes
with
the
national
interest,
interferes
with
the
interest
of
the
non-member
states,
and
interferes
with
commerce.
it
just
cannot
be
that
way.
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
of
power
involved.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
we
have
not
sought
to
get
it
approved
by
congress
for
a
number
of
years.
the
reason,
we
may
not
have
it
approved
by
congress
leads
me
to
article
8.
this
may
explain
why
we
have
problems
with
congress
and
why
appellants
are
bringing
this
lawsuit.
article
8
of
the
compact,
in
addition
to
the
subpoena
power
that
we
have
just
discussed,
does
give
the
commission
the
power
to
audit
the
books
and
records
as
agent
of
a
multistate
taxpayer.
this
power
or
authority
is
not
exercised
except
when
a
specific
state
authorizes
the
commission
as
its
agent
to
audit
the
books
and
records.
the
commission’s
auditors
have
no
power
to
fix
or
determine
any
tax
liability,
no
authority
to
fix
any
policy
of
any
member
state
in
regards
to
any
issue.
they
act
purely
as
agents
of
that
member
state.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
with
the
power
of
subpoena,
your
honor,
but
only
as
agents
of
the
tax
administrator
in
carrying
that
out.
i
said
a
comparable
power
exists
even
as
the
commission’s
audit
by
the
administrator
himself
issuing
a
subpoena
in
his
name
asking
the
taxpayer
to
turn
its
books
and
records
over
to
the
commission
as
that
tax
commissioner’s
auditing
agent.
they
are
just
parallel
powers
and
there
is
no
shift
of
power
to
the
state
that
would
in
any
way
encroach
upon
federal
supremacy
as
a
result
of
that
provision.
what
appellants
are
saying
is
that
each
state
that
wants
to
audit
the
books
and
records,
for
example,
of
us
steel,
must
have
their
auditors
lined
up
at
the
corporate
headquarters
of
us
steel
and
wait
their
turn
to
conduct
an
audit.
when
they
finally
get
through
the
forfeit
doors,
they
are
entitled
to
pick
up
information
only
for
that
one
state.
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
tax
administrators
of
the
member
state
responsible
for
administration
of
state
laws
cannot
work
together
in
a
cooperative
audit
program.
the
appellants
want
no
part
of
that
and
the
only
reason
we
can
think
that
they
do
not
want
any
part
of
it
because
this
extends
the
capability
of
the
states
to
enforce
their
tax
laws.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
kind
of
capability
is
in
national
interest.
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
states
and
it
is
in
the
interest
of
all
the
taxpayers.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
because
appellants
and
clause
and
a
lot
of
the
multistate
taxpayers
are
opposing
it
in
congress
and
want
other
federal
legislation.
the
compact
arose
out
of
the
possibility
of
restrictive
legislation
that
the
appellants
and
others
were
pushing
in
congress.
this
is
why
the
compact
contains
beneficial
provisions
for
multistate
taxpayers
in
trying
to
solve
some
of
the
problems.
but,
we
are
trying
to
get
uniformity
and
compatibility
in
the
state
tax
system
and
to
help
the
state
enforce
their
tax
laws.
they
want
no
part
of
that.
i
would
like
to
indicate
the
admission
of
the
appellants
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
compact.
they
say,
on
page
12
of
their
brief,
the
potential
impact
of
such
a
compact
is
not
readily
determinable.
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
have
any
potential
impact
on
federal
supremacy
and
that
is
the
reason
it
is
not
determinable.
all
we
are
suggesting
to
this
court
is
examine
the
case
law
concerning
the
compact
clause
,
look
at
the
specific
provisions
of
the
compact
clause
in
the
light
of
the
appellant’s
argument
and
we
are
confident
you
will
come
out
with
the
same
conclusions
that
the
three-judge
court
did
in
its
well
recent
opinion.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
adequate
for
the
appellant
simply
to
throw
judicial
history
out
of
the
window,
call
it
dicta,
limit
it
to
boundary
disputes
and
hopefully,
in
that
way,
have
this
court
come
up
with
some
different
and
new
standards.
the
constitution
means
the
same
thing
regardless
of
the
subject
matter
involved,
whether
it
involves
boundary
disputes,
reciprocal
legislation,
and
so
forth.
we
believe
the
reasoning
of
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
of
new
york
versus
o’neill
is
instructive
and
helpful
in
resolving
this
question.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
these
states
withdrew,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter
because
the
committee
on
state
taxes
of
the
council
of
state
government
composed
of
106
of
the
largest
corporations
in
the
united
states
have
as
one
of
their
objectives
to
destroy
the
cooperative
effort
represented
by
these
provisions
i
have
referred
to
you
today.
that
is
why
those
states
withdrew.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
am
sorry.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
terms
of
why
the
states
withdrew.
appellants
seem
to
think
they
know
and
they
refer
to
it
in
our
brief.
we
have
not.
we
do
not
know.
i
am
simply
talking
to
you
as
simply
a
lawyer
to
a
lawyer
in
terms
of
what
i
understand.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
there
were
certainly
political
struggles
and
these
were
the
people
that
we
were
struggling
with.
