multistate
tax
commission,
brings
us
an
appeal
from
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.19
states
are
members
of
an
agreement
called
a
multistate
tax
compact.
this
was
entered
into
primarily
to
promote
uniformity
in
state
tax
systems
to
facilitate
the
profit
of
termination
of
state
and
local
tax
liabilities.
and
to
minimize
tax
payer
inconvenience
and
duplicate
taxation.
the
compact
established
in
multistate
tax
commission
and
endowed
with
various
powers
subject
to
the
consent
of
the
states.
these
powers
included
the
right
to
conduct
tax
audits
in
the
member
states.
appellant
corporations
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
other
multistate
taxpayers
challenged
the
validity
of
the
compact.
they
argued
that
the
compact
is
invalid
under
the
compact
clause
of
the
constitution,
because
it
has
not
been
approved
by
the
congress.
they
also
contained
that
it
is
unreasonably
burdened
interstate
commerce
and
violates
their
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reject
appellant's
constitutional
challenges
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
sustain
the
validity
of
the
multi-state
tax
compact.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
joins.
