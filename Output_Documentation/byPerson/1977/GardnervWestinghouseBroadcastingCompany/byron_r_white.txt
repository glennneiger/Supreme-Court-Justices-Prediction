justice

but
if
had
i
joined
two
or
three
claims
in
a
suit
against
the
defendant
and
the
judge
terminates
my
case
with
respect
to
two
of
my
claims
and
have
permanently
reduced
the
kind
of
a
judgment
that
i
can
get,
i
still
can
appeal
unless
he
cooperates
with
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
claims
and
every
body
agrees
that
if
i
prevailed
on
all
three
claims,
i
would
have
a
millions
dollars.
if
i
prevail
on
one
instead
of
three,
i
will
have
a
$100,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be
but
it
certainly
affects
the
scope
of
my
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
i
joined
three
claims
for
an
injunction,
and
if
i
won
on
all,
i
think
that
would
be
an
injunction
of
a
certain
scope
and
if
i
only
win
on
one
it
would
would
be
a
much
narrower
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
would
be
a
1291
case,
if
the
judge
dismisses
two
of
my
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
1291?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
requires
the
judge
who
takes
up,
i
mean
1292a.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
