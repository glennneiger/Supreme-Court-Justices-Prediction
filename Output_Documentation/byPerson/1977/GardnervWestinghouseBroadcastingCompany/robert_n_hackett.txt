mr.
robert
n.
hackett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
enter
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
joan
evans
gardner
will
be
presented
first
with
a
little
statement
of
the
facts,
then
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
legal
issue
of
the
heart
of
the
relief
sought
in
the
case
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
unconditional
denial
of
the
class
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
rationale
that
the
courts
have
used
in
interpreting
section
1292(a)(1)
as
a
means
of
appealing
a
denial
of
injunction.
then,
i
would
like
look
at
the
logic
of
the
cases
under
1292(a)(1)
starting
with
the
early
cases
in
the
30s
and
finally
finishing
with
switzerland
cheese
case
in
1966.
then
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
issue
of
a
permanent
versus
a
preliminary
injunction
and
then
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
strong
policy
to
allow
civil
right
class
actions
and
finally,
the
general
floodgate
argument
that
has
been
proposed
by
the
respondent
concerning
the
floodgate
of
appeals.
joan
evans
gardner
filed
this
case
in
may
29,
1975
seeking
a
wide
class
action
under
rule
23(b)(2)
seeking
as
a
heart
of
relief,
injunctive
relief.
the
scope
of
the
class
is
set
forth
in
pages
8a
to
11a
of
the
appendix
and
the
injunctive
is
set
forth
in
complaint
that
it
was
requested
in
pages
13a
to
14a.
we
moved
within
90
days
as
required
by
the
local
rule
for
a
class
determination,
we
filed
class
interrogatories.
on
february
3rd,
1976,
the
lower
court
denied
the
class
action
stating
that
ms.
gardner
was
an
inadequate
representative
of
the
class
under
23(a)(4)
because
she
sought
a
job
that
some
other
woman
might
want
and
therefore
she
was
antagonistic
to
the
class.
this
was
an
unconditional
order.
then,
we
appealed
that
decision
as
a
matter
of
right
under
1292(a)(1)
as
a
denial
of
our
injunctive
relief
because
it
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
relief.
the
third
circuit
dismissed
with
no
jurisdiction
saying
that
1292(a)(1)
did
not
apply.
first,
i
think
it
is
obvious
the
injunctive
relief
under
b2
is
the
heart
of
the
relief
sought
in
a
wide
civil
rights
case.
we
sought
an
across
the
board
class
action
as
has
been
sanctioned
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
long
vs.seth
and
the
denial
of
the
broad
injunctive
relief
has
been
recognized
by
four
circuits.
the
first
circuit
doing
so
was
the
fourth
in
about
1962
under
brunson
vs.
board
of
trustees.
the
first,
fifth,
and
ninth
circuits
have
all
agreed
with
that
under
yaffe
vs.
powers,
jones
vs.
diamond
and
price
vs.
lucky
stores.
further,
the
determination
by
judge
mccune
that
it
was
an
unconditional
denial,
was
a
matter
of
law
and
contained
no
possibility
except
within
his
scope
of
being
reversed
because
if
she
is
antagonistic
to
the
class,
she
is
going
to
stay
antagonistic
to
the
class
thus
as
justice
stewart
said
in
united
airlines
vs.
mcdonald,
the
action
was
stripped
of
its
character
as
the
class
action.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
do
not
believe
we
could
persuade
judge
mccune
to
change
his
mind.
we
could
have
tried
but,
we
felt
first
of
all
that
we
had
a
right
of
appeal
because
of
the
four
circuits
cases
and
only
at
that
time
one
or
two
against
us
and
secondly,
it
has
been
our
experience
in
the
western
district
court
that
it
is
simply
too
unsure
and
heavy
a
burden
to
try
to
get
class
action
denials
changed.
i
guess
that
was
a
policy
decision
on
my
part.
the
unconditional
denial
doctrine
was
recognized
in
yaffe
vs.
powers
when
they
said
the
broad
injunctive
relief
was
denied.
i
now
like
to
move
to
general
rationale
of
what
the
courts
have
used
to
interpret
1292(a)(1).
the
buzz
words
that
the
courts
has
used
since
general
electric
vs.
marvel
rare
products
till
switzerland
cheese
has
not
changed.
that
is,
if
the
substantial
effect
of
the
order
is
to
deny
an
injunction
then
they
have
considered
that
rationale
as
what
they
will
look
at.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
is
that
permissive
intervention
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
under
permissive
intervention,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
appealable.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
arguably
it
does,
but
they
are
free
right
there
to
institute
their
own
suit
and
they
know
about
it
and
there
no
problem
then
instituting
the
suit.
i
think
that
is
a
little
different
fact
situation.
i
think
the
class
action
situation
is
more
like
general
electric
vs.
marvel
rare
products
where
a
counter
claim
asked
for
the
injunction
and
the
counter
claim
was
denied
and
they
held
it
was
a
denial
of
an
injunction.
the
courts
all
the
way
though
general
electric
and
switzerland
cheese
have
said
that
the
substantial
effect
doctrine
will
apply.
now
let
us
look
what
the
results
were
of
the
1291
cases.
i
submit
that
if
you
follow
the
logic
of
looking,
if
the
decision
effects
the
ultimate
relief
sought,
then
it
should
be
appealable
under
1292(a)(1).
now,
for
example,
if
you
are
just
delaying
the
decision
in
switzerland
cheese,
where
you
failed
to
grant
a
summary
judgment
and
then
you
leave
the
equitable
relief
possibility
open
to
the
end,
because
there
is
an
issue
effect.
you
are
not
affecting
the
ultimate
relief
that
you
could
get,
you
are
only
delaying
it.
again,
in
baltimore
contractors,
if
you
are
simply
refusing
to
stay
in
accounting,
an
accounting
does
not
give
you
the
ultimate
relief
and
accounting
is
only
a
means
used
to
show
if
something
is
owed
or
not.
but
in
a
class
action,
you
are
drastically
reducing
the
scope
of
the
relief
sought.
as
justice
stevens
said
in
his
dissent
in
(inaudible),
you
must
have
the
class
action
in
order
to
get
the
wide
injunctive
relief
or
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
defendant.
in
this
court,
justice
stewart
in
the
teamsters
v.
us
case,
and
justice
brennan
in
franks
v.
bowman,
set
forth
the
burden
of
proof
in
class
action
cases
and
the
injunctive
granted
in
the
class
action
sets
the
perimeters
for
that
burden
of
proof.
so
that
you
have
a
completely
different
of
proof
in
class
action
cases
and
in
the
scope
of
the
reliefs
than
you
do
in
the
mcdonald
douglas
v.
green
case
which
was
the
individual
opinion
by
justice
powell.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
if
you
joint
the
suits
and
you
have
claims?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
but
i
do
not
believe
that
is
injunctive
relief
sought
is
it
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
sir,
but
it
is
the
scope
of
the
judgment
that
is
the
issue.
it
is
the
scope,
mr.
justice
white
it
is
the
scope
of
the
injunctive
relief,
the
1292(a)(1)
speaks
to.
it
has
to
be
a
denial
of
a
relief
that
is
equitable
in
nature
and
injunctive
in
nature
and
not
just
the
a
change
in
money.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
it
would
narrow
the
injunction.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
if
you
have
three
claims
joined,
all
asking
for
injunction
and
the
claim
as
to
injunctions
is
dismissed
one
or
two
of
them,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
general
electric
marvel
case
where
the
counterclaim
came
in,
he
dismissed
the
counterclaim.
the
counterclaim
asked
for
an
injunction
held
appealable.
i
think
that
is
that
fact
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
under
1292
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
a1
does
not
required
judge
to
cooperate.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
no,
that
is
correct
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
it
as
a
matter
of
right.
in
other
words,
it
is
an
exception
to
the
rule.
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
1292a
applies
to
a
permanent
as
well
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
precedent
for
this,
in
this
courts
cases
in
george
v.
victor
talking
machine
in
1934
and
john
simons
case
in
1922,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
his
opinion
in
wetzel
indicated
that
an
appeal
would
have
been
possible
under
1292(a)(1)
by
the
granting
by
an
injunction
but
we
had
the
parties
mixed
up
in
wetzel,
so
that
we
could
not
get
it
but
he
indicated
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
possible
on
a
permanent
injunction
not
just
a
preliminary
injunction.judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
in
stewart
warner
vs.
westinghouse
in
his
dissent
indicated
that
1292(a)(1)
only
applies
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
no
other
circuits
have
excepted
that.
there
are
many
circuit
cases
and
supreme
court
cases
and
they
do
not
except
that
and
he
cited
justice
frankfurter?s
argument
1928
business
of
the
court
and
other
legislative
history
and
i
think
it
is
very
important?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
think
that
is
true.
i
believed
you
discuss
that
in
goldstein
vs.
cox
and
the
tide
water
case
that
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
but
it
is
a
good
thing
to
point
out
that
out
i
think
sir
that
the
expediting
act
says
particularly
preliminary
injunction.
but
1292(a)(1)
does
not
say
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
are
the
defendants
requesting
in
a
counterclaim
injunctive
relief?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
you
are
requesting,
yes
that
has
been
held
appealable
in
some
circuit
cases
where
they
said
that
the
dismissal
of
three
or
four
defendants
where
you
narrowed
the
in-scope
of
the
injunctive
relief,
that
would
be
appealable
under
1292a.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
am
not
sure
an
exact
number
but?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
do
not
think
it
does
conceptually.
unless
it
was
just
the
minimal.
in
other
words
you
have
to
say
and
we
have
to
the
test
as
the
substantial
affect
is
to
limit
the
injunctive
relief
sought.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
the
substantial
effect
comes
from
all
previous
cases.
the
enlow
edison
cases,
the
general
electric
case.
it
is
cited
in
baltimore
contractors.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
defendants,
that
is
a
circuit
case
billed
of
buffalo.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
that
particular
case
is
not
from
this
court,
but
the
substantial
effect
language
is
from
this
court.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
billed
of
buffalo,
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
stewart-warner.
v.
westinghouse.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
believe
we
cited
stewart-warner.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
the
next
subject
i
would
like
to
move
to
is
the
strong
policy,
that
this
court
has
recognized
--
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
there
is
authority
that
a
delay
for
continuance
in
the
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction
is
appealable.
i
do
not
believe
this
court?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
no
sir,
it
is
not
from
this
court.
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
at
the
strong
public
policy
that
was
announced
in
this
court
in
albamaro
case
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
citing
the
1972
amendments
to
title
7
and
saying
that
those
amendments
were
not
to
do
anything
that
would
discourage
private
class
actions.
it
is
important
to
realize
that
the
class
action
tool
is
the
catalyst
tool
to
enforce
title
7
by
plaintiffs
and
this
court
in
looking
at
the
class
action
in
almost
all
of
their
decision
in
franks
v.
bowman,
albamaro
and
in
teamsters
v.
us
has
recognized
that
strong
public
policy
not
to
deteriorate
use
of
the
class
action
device,
and
i
think,
one
of
the
reason
that
should
not
deteriorate
the
use
of
the
class
action
is
one
of
the
very
purposes
of
rule
23
was
to
prevent
from
multiplicity
of
suits.
that
is
that
if
you
are
suing
a
corporation
and
you
are
asking
a
broad
injunctive
relief
on
wide
basis
there
is
then
no
need
to
have
individual
suits
and
this
particular
use
of
the
device
is
exactly
what
is
meant
to
be
used
in
title
7
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
title
7
have
really
focused
on
stating
the
vast
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
vast
differences
in
the
presumptions
that
are
available
to
class
plaintiffs
when
a
decision
has
been
made
on
the
stage
one
or
liability
proceeding
of
class
actions
in
title
7,now
the
answer
--
the
first
10
pages
of
the
respondent?s
argument
and
the
questions
that
came
from
this
court
in
the
previous
argument
focused
a
good
deal
on
the
floodgate
problem.
will
we
have
a
floodgate
of
appeals
if
we
allow
this?
i
think
it
is
very
interesting
to
look
the
annual
reports
of
the
director
of
the
administrative
of
office
of
the
united
states
courts.
we
have
done
that.
we
have
taken
the
average
percentage
of
a
appeals
excluding
bankruptcy
which
are
civil
rights
appeals.
now
for
the
years
1965
to
1977
only
6.17%
of
the
appeals
were
civil
rights
appeals.
that
is
the
average
of
all
circuits.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
not
just
under
just
title
7
but
it
also
includes
1983
and
other
statutes
that
are
civil
rights
related.
i
am
not
sure
of
just
every
statute
that
it
covers.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
plus,
yes.
for
example
and,
then
it
is
interesting
to
note,
is
it
not
logical,
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
floodgate
of
appeals
that
if
we
went
to
the
fourth
circuits
and
we
went
to
bronson
v.
board
of
trustees
which
we
decided
in
1962
that
since
that
time
in
the
fourth
circuit,
the
appeals
would
have
greatly
increased
percentage
wise
compared
to
circuits
that
did
not
have
this
doctrine.
that
is
not
true.
if
we
look
at
the
fourth
circuit
from
1966
to
1977,
we
see
that
they
had
an
average
increase
of
21.14%
but
in
d
c
circuit
which
never
had
the
doctrine
and
still
does
not
have
it
because
williams
v.
mumford
denied
the
doctrine
in
?75,
they
had
an
increase
of
42.89%.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
that
is
all
appeals
sir.
obviously,
though
if
this
opened
the
floodgate,
there
would
be
some
increase
in
percentage
because
you
could
not
factor
that
percentage
increase
out
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
do
not
believe
so
it
is
important
to
realize
that
we
are
only
talking
about
roughly
6%
of
all
appeals
in
the
civil
rights
area
and
that
there
is
no
indication
that
the
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuits
and
the
first
circuit
have
increased
the
appeals
percentage
wise
when
they
switched
to
this
doctrine.
some
of
them
go
down,
therefore,
i
think
the
floodgate
of
appeal
argument
is
not
only
factually
wrong
but
also
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
burger
in
us
v.
abne(ph)
indicated
that
under
1291
and
under
the
whole
court?s
philosophy
in
looking
at
appeals
that
whether
you
have
to
do
in
essence
more
work
does
not
make
a
legal
reason
not
to
have
an
appeal
if
as
a
matter
of
right
you
have
it
under
1292(a)(1)
or
under
any
statute.
the
philosophy
has
always
been,
we
give
the
practical
and
non-technical
approach
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
legal
argument
to
argue
that
an
increase
in
load
is
a
legal
reason
for
refusing
the
appeal
and
in
closing
of
course,
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
any
event,
the
floodgate
statistics
presented
in
the
respondent?s
brief
are
not
well
founded
and
i
believe
an
analysis
of
the
administrative
court
will
show
that
they
are
not
correct.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes.
in
answer
to
justice
white?s
question,
the
ninth
circuit
case
spangler
v.
us
held
that
the
striking
of
intervention
allegations
was
a
denial
of
an
injunction.
it
is
cited
in
out
brief.
in
general,
i
would
like
to
narrow
the
grounds
of
our
appeal
to
say
that
they
are
based
on
the
first
argument
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
argument
that
the
immediate
result
of
this
order
means
that
a
person
who
had
applied
for
a
job
at
a
westinghouse
broadcasting
station
in
los
angeles
is
not
going
to
get
injunctive
relief
in
this
case
if
there
is
no
class.
the
immediacy
is
not
the
immediate
harm
to
a
person,
the
named
plaintiff.
the
immediacy
argument
is
not
relevant
to
the
appeal
under
1292(a)(1).
there
is
no
legislative
history
or
cases
that
say
the
harm
must
be
immediate.
they
say
that
the
harm
must
be
irreparable
to
the
case.
now
there
is
no
defendant
that
i
know
that
is
going
to
say
that
i
can
have
an
injunction
giving
me
an
affirmative
action
program
in
los
angeles
westinghouse
broadcasting
station
if
i
do
not
have
a
class
action.
if
i
lose
the
class
action,
i
am
never
going
to
get
that
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
no
my
client
sir.
my
client
mr.
justice
rehnquist
it
is
possible
she
alone
will
get
it
but
the
scope
of
the
injunction
will
not
be
like
under
teamsters
v.
us,
unless
that
is
a
perforce
case.
that
is
if
it
is
an
unconstitutionality
or
illegality
use
of
the
test
and
the
test
is
being
used
everywhere.
perforce
i
would
get
relief
but
in
this
particular
case
which
is
an
across
the
board
situation,
there
is
no
way
that
the
people
in
various
radio
stations
or
people
who
are
discriminated
because
they
use
all
male
salesmen
if
they
do
are
going
to
relieved.
the
injunctive
relief
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out
would
only
flow
to
the
individual
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
that
is
true
mr.
justice
marshall.
if
it
is
reinstated,
it
would
have
to
go
down
and
be
tried
all
over
again
as
a
class
action.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
that
could
be
happen.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
believe
that
under
mr.
justice
stewarts
language
in
united
airlines
vs.
mcdonald,
there
is
some
doubt
that
after
you
strip
that
class
of
its
character?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
rule
c2
says
that
it
is
conditional.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
no
i
do
not
want
you
to
sir
but
any
interlocutory
order
is
conditional.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
absolutely.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
the
judge
can
change
it
but
the
order
as
it
stands
and
as
was
said
in
yaffe
vs.
powers?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes
sir
i
do.
if
the
judge
changes
his
mind
absolutely,
they
can
get
relief.
i
call
your
attention
to
1292(a)(1)
itself
which
says
that
any
order
granting,
continuing,
modifying
refusing
or
dissolving
injunctions
or
refusing
to
dissolve,
or
modified
injunctions
now?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
in
the
class
denial
sir?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
he
did
not
use
it.
the
effect
of?
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
that
is
correct
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
because
the
case
is
interpreting
the
denial
of
injunction
saying
you
do
not
have
to
use
the
word.
if
the
interlocutory
order
has
the
effect
of
substantiate
denying
an
injunction
then
the
law
applies.
in
the
enlow
edison
rule
and
in
all
the
affirmative
decisions
under
1292(a)(1),
there
was
no
actual
use
of
the
word
injunction
in
many
of
those
cases.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
it
is
possible.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
it
is
possible
that
she
is
the
wrong
woman
although
i
do
not
think
that
is
really
the
relevant
inquiry
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
order.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
yes,
but
i
think
1292
(a)
(1)
says
you
have
to
if
the
effect
just
like
you
would
dismiss
for
jurisdiction
in
general
electric.
i
think
it
has
that
effect.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
you
have
to
use
the
test
of
having
the
court
see
if
the
substantial
effect
of
the
order
was
to
deny
an
injunction.
it
is
a
substantial
effect
of
test.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
because
it
was
a
pure
stage
one
proceeding.
he
only
found
liability.
he
did
not
do
anything
to
move
forward
and
they
did
not
comply
with
1292
(a)(1).
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
no
i
do
not
believe
because
i
think
his
order
only
found
that
a
certain
procedure
was
the
illegal.
he
may
found
that
any
injunctive
relief
was
appropriate
in
that
case
nor
was
there
a
request
by
the
plaintiff
or
the
right
party
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
he
could
find
it
but
by
throwing
the
class
out
he
has
effectively
found
it
already
as
to
the
class
that
the
gist
of
the
argument
because
they
now
have
no
class
--
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
they
can
but
i
think
the
whole
idea
of
title
7
in
class
actions
is
to
have
a
class
actions
and
prevent
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
mr.
robert
n.
hackett
i
think
it
possible
but
i
do
not
think
in
the
class
situation
we
are
under
a
legal
duty
could
go
out
and
look
for
them
and
also
the
class
action,
remember
hold
their
statute
of
limitations,
after
the
denial
the
substantive
statute
of
limitations
continues
to
run
and
they
may
lose
their
rights
simply
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
runs
and
not
know
about
the
fact
that
their
right
of
a
discharged
employee
that
his
statute
has
run.
the
class
action
device
is
meant
to
head
that
off
and
i
believe
it
does
that.
i
would
like
to
say
of
course
that
any
interlocutory
order
can
be
modified.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
class
action
device
has
spotswood
robinson
said
in
the
dc
circuit
is
a
very
necessary
device
to
title
7
cases.
any
restriction
of
the
class
action
device
will
work
as
a
detriment
to
the
enforcement
of
title
7.
thank
you.
