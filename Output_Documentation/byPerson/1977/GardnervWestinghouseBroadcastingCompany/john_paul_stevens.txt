justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
sue
for
an
injunction,
and
two
other
friends
move
to
intervene
and
they
are
denied?
is
that
denial
appealable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
is
it
appealable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
arguably,
it
certainly
denies
them
an
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
the
case
cited
that
you
are
referring
to
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquists
questions?
about
dismissing
particular?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
all
appeals
or?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say
if
the
complaint
does
ask
for
preliminary
injunction
and
for
class
certification
than
if
the
judge
denies
the
class
certification,
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
four
plaintiffs
all
of
them
ask
for
preliminary
relief,
the
judge
grants
preliminary
relief
for
two
and
refuses
it
for
two
and
the
two
want
to
appeal?
now
that
is
under
1292,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
just
grants
a
preliminary
injunction
for
two
of
the
plaintiffs
and
denies
if
for
the
two
of
the
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose,
if
on
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
the
judge
with
respect
to
two
of
the
parties
says,
you
just
do
not
have
any
claim
anyway
so
i
am
dismissing
your
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
determining
that
there
are
a
lot
of
unnamed
plaintiffs
who
cannot
have
an
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
there
is
a
lot
of
unnamed
plaintiffs
who
cannot
have
any
relief
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
filed
a
complaint
asking
for
a
permanent
injunction
and
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
it
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
granted.
is
that
appealable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
i
am
a
defendant
and
i
file
a
counterclaim
and
ask
for
an
injunction?
dismissed
from
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
this
court
held.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
held
it
was
appealable
under
the
predecessor
of
1292.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
some
cases
on
the
appealability
of
orders
denying
intervention
in
injunctive
suits?
are
there
some
decisions
on
the
appealability
of
orders
denying
intervention
in
injunction
suits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
some
decisions
holding
appealable
or
un-appealable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
found
some
cases
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
an
injunction
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
she
wins
her
case,
do
you
think
she
would
get
an
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
of
these
case
involve
the
question
whether
an
appeal
maybe
taken
from
a
trial
court
order
which
denies
the
plaintiff
the
right
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
similarly
situated
persons.
the
question
in
each
case
is
the
appealability
of
a
an
order
denying
class
certification.
in
the
gardner
case,
the
plaintiff
had
been
denied
a
position
as
a
radio
performer
and
sought
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
--
she
claimed,
she
had
been
denied
this
position
because
of
her
sex
and
she
sought
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
women
who
had
been
discriminated
against
by
the
defendant
in
either
applying
for
positions
with
the
company
or
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
the
trial
judge
denied
her
the
right
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
alleged
class.
she
sought
to
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
denial
was
in
effect
a
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
because
the
relief
she
could
get
as
an
individual
was
less
broad
than
the
relief
which
might
be
obtained
on
behalf
of
the
class.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
order
could
not
be
appealed
on
that
theory
pursuant
to
section
1292
(a)
(1)
of
the
judicial
code.
in
the
other
case,
the
coopers
and
lybrand
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
purchasers
of
securities
at
a
public
offering.
they
sought
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
all
other
purchasers
at
the
same
public
offering
and
although
the
trial
court
originally
allowed
them
the
right
to
do
so,
it
redetermined
the
matter
and
held
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
class,
their
claim
that
there
being
at
the
offering
violated
the
securities
acts
because
of
certain
alleged
misrepresentations
in
the
prospectus.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
sufficient
monetary
interest
in
the
matter,
two
plaintiffs,
the
husband
and
wife
in
their
own
right
to
go
forward
with
the
action
and
therefore
denying
them
class
status,
denying
them
the
right
to
represent
the
class,
in
effect
killed
off
the
entire
action,
was
the
death
nail
of
the
action
and
was
the
equivalent
therefore
of
the
final
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
after
reviewing
the
finances
of
the
litigants
and
the
issues
and
the
complexity
of
litigation,
concluded
that
it
was
indeed
the
death
nail
and
that
the
appeal
therefore
could
be
taken.
in
both
cases,
we
hold
that
the
rules
for
appealabilty
of
the
class
action
determinations
are
not
different
from
other
rules
governing
appealability
in
the
federal
courts
and
that
there
are
no
special
rules
designed
for
this
kind
of
litigation,
yet
that
if
congress
wants
to
makes
these
orders
appealable,
it
certainly
has
the
right
to
do
so,
but
under
the
rules
that
have
been
fashioned
up
to
now,
an
appeal
does
not
lie.
so
in
both
cases
the
unanimous
holding
of
the
court
is
that
the
orders
may
not
be
appealed.
that
means
that
in
the
gardner
case
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed
and
in
the
coopers
and
lybrand
case
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
reversed
and
opinions
to
that
affect
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk.
