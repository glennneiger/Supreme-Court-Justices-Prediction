justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
possibility
remain
open
that
persuaded
judge
mccune
to
change
his
mind?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
say
rule
54,
it
is
not
involved
at
all
in
a
1292a
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
named
six
defendants,
and
you
are
having
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction
before
a
district
judge
and
he
grants
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
one
of
the
six
defendants,
is
that
appealable
under
the
1292a?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
goes
for
just
dismissal
of
one
out
of
ten
defendants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
it
possibly
make
any
difference
as
to
the
exact
number?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
the
word
substantial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
from
this
court
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
move
to
that,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
supposing
again
in
a
hypothetical
case,
you
have
six
defendants
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
district
court
grants
a
preliminary
injunction
as
to
five
of
the
defendants,
says
he
reserves
ruling
as
to
the
sixth
defendant
will
not
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
does
not
dismiss
him
and
puts
the
home
ad
over
for
hearing
on
a
final
injunction,
appealable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
authority
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
judge
mccune's
order
rule
out
the
possibility
of
mrs.
gardner?s
ultimately
obtaining
on
her
own
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
think
that
an
order
granting
a
preliminary
injunction
and
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
post
a
$50,000.00
bonds
is
appealable
by
the
plaintiff
as
to
the
question
of
the
amount
of
the
bond?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
you
argument
in
giving
us
those
figures
that
those
figures
themselves
are
the
result
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
just
a
plain
prayer
to
intervene
by
a
denied,
is
that
appealable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
utah?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel
in
wetzel,
it
was
liberty
mutual
was
appealing
and
liberty
mutual
had
not
sought
any
injunction.
was
that
not
the
reason
we
said
that
that
was
not
appealable
as
an
order
to
deny
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
referred
to
it,
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
have
referred
to
-
?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
your
client
is
never
going
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
is
the
result
of
a
refusal
to
make
discovery
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff?
the
district
court
enters
an
order
that
a
particular
paragraph
in
the
plaintiffs
request
for
instruction
will
be
deemed
denied.
is
that
appealable
under
your
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
not
counsels
argument
in
response
to
my
question
in
liberty
mutual
a
perfectly
good
one
that
judge
webber
in
that
case
had
come
right
down
to
the
wire
and
had
all
but
granted
an
injunction
against
liberty
mutual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
give
he
was
a
lot
further
along
the
road
towards
granting
an
injunction
against
liberty
mutual
than
your
case
was
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
judge
mccune
might
have
found
not
injunctive
relief
was
available
here
in
this
case
even
though
he
had
ruled
the
other
way
on
your
class
certification
questions.
