mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
narrow
question
as
to
whether
the
denial
of
class
certification
in
a
lawsuit
seeking
permanent
but
not
preliminary
injunctive
relief
is
immediately
appealable
as
of
right
under
28
us
code
1292(a)(1)
as
an
interlocutory
order
refusing
an
injunction.
it
is
undisputed
that
congress
in
adopting
1292
intended
a
very
limited
exception
to
the
final
judgment
rule
embodied
in
1291
which
since
the
first
judiciary
act
has
been
the
dominant
rule
of
appellate
practice.
congress
has
determined
that
with
respect
to
certain
specific
categories
of
interlocutory
orders
set
forth
in
sub
section
a,
an
immediate
appeal
should
be
allowed
as
of
right
and
is
also
provided
for
discretionary
appellate
review
of
other
interlocutory
orders
under
1292b
provided
the
conditions
set
forth
in
that
sub
section
are
met.
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
decisions
that
appeal
rights
cannot
depend
upon
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
congress
has
necessarily
had
to
draw
the
jurisdictional
statutes
in
terms
of
categories.
thus
the
issue
in
any
given
case
including
this
one
is
whether
the
particular
order
appealed
from
fits
within
the
category
of
appeals
allowed
by
congress
or
whether
the
appeal
is
not
permissible
in
the
light
of
the
principles
and
the
history
concerning
appellate
jurisdiction
and
in
particular,
the
longstanding
congressional
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
section
1292
does
not
expressly
provide
a
right
of
appeal
with
respect
to
orders
either
granting
or
denying
class
action
status.
not
withstanding
that
fact,
mrs.
gardner
sought
to
appeal
the
district
courts
denial
of
certification
and
argues
the
her
appeal
comes
within
the
narrow
exception
to
the
final
judgment
rule
set
forth
in
1292(a)(1)
which
permits
an
appeal
from
an
interlocutory
order
granting
or
refusing
an
injunction.
in
that
connection,
it
is
significant
that
no
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
was
ever
made
and
preliminary
injunctive
relief
was
not
even
requested
in
the
compliant.
while
the
complaint
does
contain
a
prayer
for
permanent
injunctive
relief,
the
district
court
in
refusing
to
remit
this
case
to
proceed
as
a
class
action
did
not
state
that
the
claim
for
permanent
injunctive
relief
had
no
merit
nor
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
injunction
nor
did
it
even
express
any
opinion
as
to
whether
injunctive
relief
might
be
warranted
at
any
particular
point
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
we
would
have
made
the
same
argument
and
our
position
is
the
same.
as
mr.
hackett
indicated
judge
marshall,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
1292(a)(1)
applies
to
the
denial
and
grant
of
permanent
injunctions
as
well
preliminary
injunction.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
what
congress
really
intended
to
reach
here
were
denials
of
preliminary
injunctions
and
in
switzerland
cheese
when
this
court
had
that
issue
before
it,
it
expressly
decided
that
it
would
not
decide
whether
1292
(a)(1)
did
or
did
not
apply
to
a
permanent
as
well
as
preliminary
injunctions.
however,
i
think
our
position
for
the
reasons
that
i
would
state
would
be
the
same,
regardless
of
whether
this
court
decides
that
1292(a)(1)
applies
to
permanent
as
well
as
preliminary
injunctions.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
absolutely.
certainly.
the
district
court
in
this
case
however
made
no
order
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
suit.
the
district
court
simply
decided
that
mrs.
gardner
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
rule
23
a
2,
3,
and
4
and
concluded
that
for
that
reason
she
was
an
inadequate
class
representative
and
that
the
case
could
not
proceed
as
a
class
action.
this
class
determination
order
was
wholly
procedural
and
did
not
in
any
way
determine
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
not
at
all,
not
at
all
justice
rehnquist.
not
only
did
it
not
rule
that
out
but
it
is
in
entirely
possible
that
if
she
proved
the
kind
of
case
that
she
alleged
in
her
complaint
that
the
relief
that
she
might
get
in
her
individual
case
might
read
down
to
the
benefit
of
the
putative
class.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
this
case
would
proceed
only
as
an
individual
action
in
and
of
itself
would
not
determine
the
total
scope
of
possible
injunctive
relief.
that
would
not
be
known
and
could
not
be
known
until
a
final
hearing
on
the
merits.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
have
the
right
appeal
it
under
1292
(a)(1)
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
because
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the,
i
am
sorry,
you
are
saying
if
these
cases
are
heard
on
the
merits
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
think
that
that
would
be
appealable,
yes.
by
the
other
two
yes.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
think
that
however
here
of
course?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
would
the
same
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
there
the
action
of
the
court
has
an
immediate
impact.
the
injunction
is
denied.
it
is
expressly
denied.
in
this
case,
that
has
not
happened
and
may
not
happen.
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no
sir
your
honor,
we
are
not
doing
that.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no
all
we
are
saying
is
that
this
case
cannot
proceed
as
a
class
action.
those
people
would
have
the
right
of
intervention.
they
could
come
in
as
interveners.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
decides
is
a
procedural
question
that
this
case
could
not
proceed
as
class
action.
it
made
no
determination
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
case
with
respect
to
unnamed
members
of
the
class.
not
only
that
but
as
justice
rehnquist
recognized
that
decision
that
this
case
could
not
proceed
as
a
class
action
is
subject
to
subsequent
alteration
or
amendment
at
any
time
prior
to
final
judgment
both
with
respect
to
rule
23(c)(1)
and
of
course,
the
court?s
inherent
power
to
modify
any
order
that
is
not
a
final
order
and
mr.
hackett,
if
he
were
persuasive
enough,
might
have
convinced
judge
mccune
at
some
future
date
that
he
was
wrong
and
that
the
case
should
proceed
as
a
class
action
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case.
that
judge
changed
his
mind
and
said
that
the
case
that
he
originally
thought
should
proceed
as
a
class
action
should
be
de-certified
and
not
proceed
as
a
class
action.
so
it
was
simply,
by
its
term
a
tentative
provisional
order.
it
decided
nothing
except
that
for
now
and
until
the
judge
changed
his
mind
that
this
would
be
an
individual
action
in
which
others
could
intervene
to
assert
their
rights
but
that
it
could
not
be
a
class
action.
now
ms.
gardner
argues
that
she
has
a
right
to
appeal
under
1292(a)(1)
because
the
denial
of
class
certification
amounted
to
the
effective
denial
of
broad
injunctive
relief
sought
an
behalf
of
the
clients
and
therefore
constituted
an
order
of
immediate
and
irreparable
consequences
within
the
meeting
of
baltimore
contractors.
that
is
her
argument.
the
contention
is
without
merit
for
a
number
of
reasons.section
1292(a)(1)
is
clearly
as
i
have
indicated
intended
to
provide
interlocutory
appellate
review
only
for
those
orders
which
directly
and
immediately
either
grant
or
refuse
injunctive
relief.
congress
recognized
that
unless
an
immediate
appeal
were
permitted
that
there
could
be
no
effective
review
of
an
order
for
example,
granting
or
refusing
a
preliminary
injunction
and
that
to
delay
review
until
after
a
final
decision
on
the
merits
would
be
the
practical
equivalent
of
no
review
at
all.
it
would
be
impossible
to
review
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
after
the
case
had
proceeded
to
a
merits
determinations
and
the
court
had
made
a
decision
so
consequently,
it
adopted
1292(a)(1).
the
order
ms.
gardner
appealed
from
here
does
not
posses
this
characteristic
which
is
essential
to
a
right
of
appeal
under
1292
(a)
(1).
the
denial
of
class
certification
does
not
amount
to
the
denial
of
an
injunction
and
it
has
no
immediate
impact
or
effect.
it
is
strictly
a
procedural
pretrial
order
which
in
no
way
attaches
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
if
this
case
were
appealable
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
reverse
the
class
certification,
this
note
would
not
result
in
an
automatic
injunction.
the
case
would
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
an
injunction
was
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
would
say
that
is
appealable
under
1291.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
again
i
think
that
that
would
be
appealable
before
the
reason
as
a
final
order
with
respect
to
the
counterclaim.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
ge
vs.
marvel.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
you
maybe
right
on
that
your
honor,
it
did
but
the
different
between
the
ge
v.
marvel
case,
in
this
case
is
there
when
the
court
dismisses
the
counterclaim
seeking
injunctive
relief,
it
is
acting
now
and
immediately.
that
is
the
denial
of
an
injunction
when
it
dismisses
a
counterclaim.
that
is
the
different
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
there
it
operates
immediately,
it
operate
now,
whereas
here,
it
may
never
operate.
now
even
if
we
were
to
assume
arguendo,
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
denial
of
a
class
action
status
may
narrow
the
scope
of
injunctive
relief
which
may
ultimately
be
awarded
and
that
is
her
claim,
this
effect
will
occur
if
it
occurs
at
all
only
after
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
that
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
ge
v.
marvel
case
and
at
that
time,
when
there
has
been
a
determination
on
the
merits,
that
action
is
fully
reviewable
along
with
the
final
decision
on
the
merits,
regardless
of
whether
mrs.
gardner
wins
or
loses
with
respect
to
her
individual
claim
and
that
is
the
united
airlines
vs.
mcdonald
douglas
case
recognizes
that.
moreover,
and
quite
apart
from
that,
many
types
of
interlocutory
orders
of
a
trial
court
have
a
significant
impact
on
a
litigants
ability
to
obtain
equitable
relief
and
this
consideration
has
never
been
viewed
as
a
sufficient
ground
for
contravention
of
the
strong
and
explicit
congressional
policy
against
piecemeal
or
appeals.
as
a
typical
example,
an
order
granting
or
refusing
discovery
or
an
evidentiary
ruling
may
have
a
vital
affect
on
the
scope
of
the
relief
ultimately
obtained
and
yet
that
does
not
covert
them
into
appealable
orders.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
the
collateral
order
doctrine
or
something
like
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
it
would
not
come
up
under
1292(a)(1).
it
would
come
up
under
the
cohen
vs.
beneficial
insurance
company
rule,
i
believe.
now
we
have
talked
about
the
matter
of
docket
of
the
appellate
courts
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
this
court.
we
have
the
statistics
set
forth
in
pages
13
to
14
of
our
brief
but
briefly,
in
the
15
year
period
from
1962
to
1977,
the
number
of
actions
filed
increased
by
300
percent
in
the
number
and
this
on
the
appellate
docket
and
the
number
of
appeals
pending
increased
by
400
percent
and
in
over
a
half
of
the
circuits,
the
number
of
pending
cases
have
increased,
appeals
have
increased
by
600%.
that
is
an
alarming
statistic
and
if
this
appeal
that
mrs.
gardner
has
were
allowed
that
there
will
be
no
limitation
on
the
number
of
appeals
that
you
could
have
because
what
would
happen
is
that
in
every
case
where
it
is
possible,
a
plaintiff
would
include
a
prayer
for
injunctive
relief.
he
would
be
foolish
if
he
did
not
and
then
if
there
is
any
order
that
he
says
might
affect
the
scope
of
relief
then
he
could
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
1292(a)(1)
because
their
argument
is
not
limited
to
class
certification
questions.
the
statute
does
not
deal
with
that.
the
principle
that
he
is
attempting
to
assert
is
that
any
time
there
is
an
order
which
might
affect
the
scope
of
injunctive
relief
then
that
is
the
practical
equivalent
of
the
denial
of
an
injunction
and
appealable
under
1292(a)(1)
and
there
would
be
many,
many
more
appeals
under
that
type
of
rationale
than
we
have
now
as
bad
as
the
current
docket
it
is.
now
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
not
at
all,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
are
bad.
but
they
would
be
much
worse.
that
is
right.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
as
bad
as
they
hardly
would
be,
much,
much
worse
if
we
did
not
have
that.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes
there
are.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
there
is
no
figures.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
there
are
three
circuits
that
hold
that
the
denial
of
certification
is
not
appealable
under
1292(a)(1).
that
would
be
the
third
circuit,
the
dc
circuits
and
the
second
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
says
where
there
is
no
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
and
no
hearing
on
preliminary
injunctive
relief,
no
right
to
appeal
the
adverse
class
determination
under
1292(a)(1)
and
there
are
four
circuits
that
go
the
other
way.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
appealable.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
have
not
seen
any
cases
on
that
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
of
any.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
is
permissible.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
you
may
be
correct
on
that
and
i
am
sure
i
must
be
in
error
on
it.
a
rule
of
appealability
based
upon
the
eventual
effect
of
an
order
has
of
course
no
easily
definable
limit
and
would
provide
the
plaintiffs
with
more
than
one
opportunity
to
obtain
piecemeal
review
of
a
wide
variety
of
interlocutory
orders
and
which
would
mean
that
the
final
judgment
rule
would
eventually
be
swallowed
up
by
what
congress
intended
to
be
a
narrow
exception.
moreover,
such
a
rule
of
appealability,
we
believe
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
justice
rehnquist?s
decision
in
wetzel
which
showed
that
an
order
granting
judgment
on
the
merits
for
the
plaintiff
without
ruling
on
the
request
for
injunctive
relief
was
not
appealable
by
the
defendants
under
1292(a)(1)
despite
its
inherent
effect
on
the
ultimate
availability
of
injunctive
relief.
a
rule
of
appealability
such
as
that
advocated
by
ms.
gardner
would
further
burden
the
appellate
courts
with
a
task
of
determining
in
each
case
the
jurisdictional
question
of
whether
the
order
appealed
from,
had
the
effect
of
granting
or
denying
an
injunction
and
it
would
have
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
might
well
be
inadequate
for
that
purpose.
now
ms.
gardner
also
argues
that
the
1292(a)(1)
should
be
extended
to
interlocutor
orders
denying
class
status
because
immediate
review
might
avoid
an
unnecessary
trial
and
expense.
it
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
baltimore
contractors
as
mr.
justice
black
mentioned
in
his
dissent
but
that
consideration
really
is
not
to
remain.
it
is
the
function
of
congress
to
determine
whether
the
time
and
expense
that
might
be
say,
by
permitting
interlocutory
appeals
sufficiently
out
weighs
the
impact
of
the
effect
of
permitting
those
appeals
on
the
docket
of
the
appellate
court.
that
is
the
function
of
the
congress.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
is
not
authorized
to
approve
or
declare
judicial
modification
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes
regardless
of
the
importance
of
the
issue
or
other
considerations.
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute.
does
it
permit
an
appeal
or
does
it
not?
this
statute
does
not
say
that
an
order
which
directly
or
indirectly
grants
an
injunction
nor
does
it
say
that
which
effectively
grants
or
denies
an
injunction
is
appealable.
it
says
interlocutory
order
granting
or
refusing
an
injunction.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
your
honor
that
is
true,
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
dictum
in
that
case
and
you
were?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
you
are
right
but
of
course
the
ultimate
impact
if
you
adopted
their
argument,
they
could
have
said
that
the
effect
of
that
order
granting
liability
was
to
effectively
grant
an
injunction
even
though,
the
only
thing
that
was
left
to
be
done
by
judge
webber
was
to
issue
the
injunction.
that
is
what
we
mean
by
the
statement,
so
if
you
followed
an
effective
standard,
you
would
have
permitted
an
appeal
in
wetzel
we
believe.
now
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit
was
clearly
correct
in
its
conclusion
that
ms.
gardner?s
theory
of
appealability
would
represent
an
unwarranted
expansion
of
1292(a)(1).
now
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
second
point
that
we
would
argue
and
that
is
even
if
the
effective
denial
of
an
injunction
standard
is
a
correct
standard
under
1292(a)(1),
that
standard
has
no
application
here
because
the
denial
of
class
certification
cannot
constitute
the
effective
denial
of
an
injunction.
we
say
that
for
three
reasons.
first,
because
the
order
was
tentative
and
provisional
under
rule
23c1.
it
could
be
altered
at
any
time.
secondly,
because
it
is
by
no
means
clear
what
relief
if
any
ms.
gardner
could
get
in
her
lawsuit.
that
fact
would
not
be
known
until
after
a
final
hearing
on
the
merits
and
to
ask
an
appellate
court
on
a
1292(a)(1)
appeal
to
speculate
as
to
what
relief
she
might
able
to
get
if
she
proves
her
case
on
the
basis
of
an
inadequate
record,
i
think
is
an
unworkable
standard
and
places
an
impossible
burden
on
the
court
of
appeals.
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
will
not
be
known
until
she
puts
in
her
proof.
now
third,
of
course
is
the
fact
that
at
any
time
there
could
be
intervention
by
other
persons
in
the
putative
class
and
if
those
persons
appeal
then
the
scope
of
the
relief
might
be
different
than
if
she
proceeds
with
an
individual
action
or
it
might
not.
but
again
that
is
something
that
will
occur
at
some
time
in
the
future
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
intervention
by
other
people,
in
this
lawsuit
might
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
injunctive
relief
that
might
ultimately
be
attained
and
obtained.
so
for
all
three
of
those
reasons,
we
say
that
the
denial
of
class
certification
cannot
possibly
constitute
the
effective
denial
of
an
injunction.
now
ms.
gardner
makes
a
point
in
her
brief
that
if
she
has
not
permitted
to
appeal
now,
that
it
is
likely
that
this
case
will
never
be
appealed
and
she
says
that
for
two
reasons.
she
says
first,
if
i
lose
on
the
merits,
i
have
no
right
to
appeal
the
adverse
class
determination
under
rodriguez
and
she
says
if
i
win
on
the
my
individual
case,
i
will
have
no
incentive
to
appeal.
now
the
first
is
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
second
is
purely
speculative
irrelevant
at
best.
first
rodriguez
as
we
read
it
says
nothing
about
her
right
to
appeal
the
adverse
class
determination
after
final
judgment
if
she
loses
her
case.
united
airlines
says
that.
secondly
you
cannot
fashion
a
rule
of
law?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
american
airlines
says
that
as
well
because
there
the
court
referred
to
and
there
are
two
cases
that
they
referred
galvin
v.
lavigne
and
esplin
v.
hershey
where
the
plaintiff
won
below
and
where
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
she
won,
she
was
permitted
to
appeal
the
adverse
class
determination
question.
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
those
are
court
of
appeal
decisions.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
both
them.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
are
in
brief,
justice
brennan.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
were
cited
in
the
opinion
in
united
airlines
and
i
think
there
is
good
reason
for
that.
for
one
thing
attorney?s
fees.
attorneys
fees
would
be
greater
obviously
if
they
were
class
action
and
than
if
the
case
proceeded
as
an
individual
action.
secondly
plaintiff
as
she
regards
herself
or
he
regards
herself
as
a
private
attorney
general,
they
will
feel
that
they
have
an
institutional
interest
in
attempting
to
protect
the
putative
class
so
even
though
they
win
their
case,
they
will
want
to
appeal
the
adverse
class
determination
and
there
may
well
be
other
considerations
but
the
critical
fact
is
not
that
she
may
not,
she
may
decide
for
herself
that
she
does
not
want
to
appeal.
the
critical
fact
is
that
she
has
the
right
to
do
so
and
if
she
fails
to
do
so
for
whatever
reason
under
united
airline,
the
putative
members
of
the
class
could
intervene
at
that
time
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
the
adverse
class
determination
so
there
is
no
question?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
promptly
within
the
time
that
she
could
have
done
so
herself,
so
that
there
is
no
question
that
they
are
protected
in
that
respect.
now
if
you
have
somebody
who
is
unaware
of
dependency
of
this
class
action
and
who
has
not
filed
charges,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
first
part
is
if
they
are
unaware
of
this
action,
they
certainly
have
not
relied
upon
its
existence
in
refraining
from
prosecuting
a
claim
and
if
they
have
not
filed
charges,
i
suggest
it
is
because
they
believe
that
they
have
not
been
injured.
but
in
any
event,
they
would
not
be
barred
by
principles
of
res
judicata
by
anything
that
happened
in
this
case.
now
we
have
other
arguments
in
the
case
policy
considerations,
i
think
they
are
amply?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
possibly
or
possibly
not.
