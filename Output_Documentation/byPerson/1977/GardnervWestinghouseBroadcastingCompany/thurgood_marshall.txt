justice

marshall
i
know
it
is
true
that
the
old
three
judge
court,
you
could
not
get
a
three
judge
court
unless
you
ask
for
preliminary
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
no
longer
true
so
i
guess
maybe
that
might
be
the
reason
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
but
that
is
not
true
anymore.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
had
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
would
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
prayer
to
intervene
is
appealable?
it
used
to
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
granted,
it
is
not
appealable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
the
final
judgment
is
made,
the
class
action
has
been
reinstated
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
had
not
stopped
it
when
you
did
stop
it,
will
it
go
on
and
tried
it
as
an
individual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
before
the
judgment,
the
judge
says
look
i
have
decided
i
was
wrong
about
that
class
action.
bring
the
class
in
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
rule
said
specifically,
the
rule
says
that
it
can
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
me
to
ignore
that
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
this
particular
rule
says
that
this
can
be
changed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
judge
could
have
changed
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
would
point
and
say
there
was
no
way
that
this
woman
in
los
angeles
can
get
any
relief,
is
that
not
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
change
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
in
this
order
used
the
word
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
it
did
not
say
one
word
about
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
had
not
reached
the
injunction
point
of
the
case
yet
had
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
use
that
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
in
this
case,
that
this
woman
is
a
wrong
woman
so
then
you
appeal
on
that
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
would
deny
her
an
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
could
have
been
denied
because
she
moved
to
timbuktu?
we
are
talking
about
when
the
case
is
finished
which
could
be
three
years
from
now.
i
cannot
project
that
far
off.
