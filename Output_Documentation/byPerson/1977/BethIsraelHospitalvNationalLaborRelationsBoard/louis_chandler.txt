mr.
louis
chandler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
no
solicitation,
no
distribution
rule
as
it
applies
to
a
nonprofit
hospital's
cafeteria
which
is
used
by
patients,
their
families
and
employees.
the
primary
function
of
a
hospital
is
to
provide
patient
care
and
critical
to
that
function
is
providing
an
atmosphere
as
free
from
stress
and
strain
as
possible.
the
hospital's
rule,
banning
solicitation
and
distribution
of
literature
which
can
be
disruptive
to
the
care
of
patients
and
all
patient
and
family
access
areas
including
the
cafeteria
is
clearly
in
furtherance
of
that
concern.
congress,
in
amending
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1974
to
include
coverage
of
nonprofit
hospitals
explicitly
stated
that
hospitals
are
unique
and
expressed
its
concern
for
the
well
being
of
hospital
patients
and
a
need
to
avoid
disruption
wherever
possible.
this
concern
was
recognized
by
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
nlrb
versus
baylor,
cited
in
the
brief,
and
the
tneth
circuit
court
in
nlrb
versus
st.
john's
hospital
also
cited
both
of
which
denied
enforcement
to
board
orders
and
upheld
no
solicitation
rules
in
patient
access
areas
of
those
hospitals.
the
lead
and
justification
of
beth
israel's
rule
is
graphically
demonstrated
in
this
case
where
union
literature
was
passed
out
in
the
cafeteria
viciously
disparaging
the
quality
of
healthcare
provided
by
the
hospital.
let
us
consider
the
effect
on
an
ambulatory
patient
visiting
with
his
family
in
the
cafeteria
who
picks
up
a
union
leaflet
left
on
a
table
with
statements
such
as
the
following:
"they
totally
ignored
me
while
i
was
a
patient.
my
experience
was
bewildering,
painful
and
ugly.
i
was
lucky
it
was
not
a
complicated
delivery.
do
not
ever
have
a
baby
here
unless
you
have
a
private
doctor.
reports
and
films
have
become
backed
up.
doctors
cannot
get
their
films
and
reports
on
time.
patient
care
is
suffering."
mr.
louis
chandler
this
is
union
literature
distributed
by
employees
in
the
cafeteria
at
beth
israel
hospital,
in
an
area
where
patients
and
their
families
frequent.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
it
is.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
was
a
renovation
and
the
space
of
a
cafeteria
was
expanded
to
include
the
coffee
shop
area,
so
now
there
is
a
greater
seating
capacity
in
the
cafeteria
than
when
the
case
first
arose.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
coffee
shop
was
also
run
by
the
hospital
personnel
with
employees.
there
were
vending
machines
in
this
area
and
seating
areas
for
patients
and
employees
and
visitors
of
patients.
there
were
other
remarks
that
are
contained
in
the
record
appendix
and
union
propaganda.
"due
to
understaffing,
lab
specimens
sit
on
countertops
for
hours
therefore
results
are
misleading
or
altogether
wrong.
much
of
the
hospital
is
not
maintained
in
a
sanitary
manner.
respiratory
treatments
ordered
by
doctors
are
not
always
performed.
patients
who
need
treatments
to
stay
alive
get
them
but
those
who
need
them
to
get
better
do
not
get
them.
the
ratio
of
patients
to
nurses
presents
a
hazardous
environment
and
precludes
the
delivery
of
optimal
healthcare."
the
record
appendix
is
replete
with
such
examples.
mr.
louis
chandler
your
honor,
the
board,
national
labor
relations
board,
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases
that
union
solicitation
--
forget
about
scurrilous
propaganda
--
but
the
normal
union
solicitation
as
a
part
of
an
organizational
campaign
is
potentially
disruptive.
in
the
retail
store
industry
and
restaurants,
they
find
that
this
is
enough
to
warrant
a
broad
ban
on
such
activity,
union
solicitation
and
distribution
wherever
customers
are
present
or
likely
to
be
present.
what
the
hospital
is
asserting
is
the
same
interest
that
applies
to
an
employer
who
operates
a
restaurant
or
retail
store,
that
patients
who
are
sick
and
their
families
who
are
coming
to
a
hospital
setting
and
understandably
anxious
and
vulnerable,
as
the
board
itself
has
recognized,
should
be
entitled
to
at
least
the
same
treatment
as
customers
who
come
into
a
retail
store.
it
is
a
matter
of
common
sense.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
the
tenor
of
this
literature
is
geared
towards
complaints
about
working
conditions
as
most
union
campaigns
are.
mr.
louis
chandler
not
in
other
kinds
of
situations
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
hospital
and
they
are
raising
concerns
that
are
concerns
to
patients
and
here
where
the
hospital
has
areas
that
are
set
aside
for
employees
to
engage
in
this
activity.
there
are
employee
only
areas
within
the
hospital
and
they
may
organize,
they
may
distribute
literature
in
those
areas
without
interfering
with
patients
or
their
families.
so
the
hospital
feels
that
in
order
to
protect
patients,
to
insulate
them
from
the
potential
disruption
of
this
kind
of
literature
or
any
kind
of
disruptive
literature,
and
especially
union
literature
because
the
board
itself
has
given
its
staff
approval
to
banning
that
kind
of
distribution
because
that
in
and
of
itself
is
inherently
disruptive
according
to
the
board.
the
controversial
remarks
such
as
this
--
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
hospital's
rule
was
promulgated
initially
during
the
vietnam
war
to
avoid
demonstrations
in
the
hospital
throughout
patient
care
at
patient
access
areas.
the
rule
has
been
amended
since
then
a
number
of
times,
however,
the
present
rule
involves
a
total
ban
on
solicitation
and
distribution
in
patient
access
areas.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
to
indicate
that
it
fell
into
patients'
hands
at
all.
however,
the
board,
in
its
other
case
precedent,
recognizes
that
leaflets
may
be
left
in
customer
access
areas
and
may
be
discarded
and
picked
up
by
a
customer
and
we
feel
that
there
is
a
logical
inference
that
that
could
happen
in
this
setting
as
well.
rather
than
being
sensitive
to
the
unique
conditions
found
in
the
hospital,
and
to
the
declared
intent
of
congress
to
recognize
the
special
needs
of
patients,
the
board
has
mechanically
applied
rules
that
pseudo
factory
environment
where
no
patients,
customers
or
third
parties
are
involved.
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
special
circumstances
present
in
a
hospital
environment
involving
patient
care
considerations.
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
hospital
operation
and
the
treatment
of
patients,
is
the
fact
that
patients
are
understandably
anxious
and
vulnerable
and
likely
to
be
upset
by
union
solicitation
and
distribution
in
patient
access
areas.
the
board
itself
recognized
this
principle
prior
to
the
74
amendments,
in
the
guyan
valley
hospital
case
which
was
cited
in
the
brief.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
question
of
degrees
and
if
the
hospital
were
to
allow
some
union
solicitation
on
a
selective
basis,
it
would
create
problems
of
deciding
which
to
allow
and
which
not
to
allow.
in
that
particular
case,
i
would
think
that
there
could
be
a
problem
from
a
patient's
point
of
view
feeling
that
there
is
some
undercurrent
within
the
hospital
that
employees
are
dissatisfied
with
the
hospital
and
they
may
not
be
able
to
go
about
their
duties
properly.
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
the
board,
in
guyan
valley,
affirmed
administrative
law
judge's
decision,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the
hospital
services
ill
individuals
who
in
their
weakened
condition
may
readily
be
upset
if
they
overhear
anti
union,
pro
union
arguments
among
employees
while
they,
the
patients,
are
in
their
rooms
or
in
the
halls
or
elevators
and
taking
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
institution
and
the
necessity
for
protecting
patients,
any
presumption
of
illegality
is
over
come.
mr.
louis
chandler
this
case
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
guyan
valley
case
that
i
am
citing
now
involved
patient
access
areas.
this
was
a
rule
that
was
in
effect
prior
to
the
amendments.
the
board
recognized
that
a
hospital
creates
a
special
circumstance
and
they
allowed
just
like
they
did
with
retail
stores,
they
allowed
an
exception
to
the
normal
presumptions
and
said
that
in
patient
access
areas
and
they
defined
them
as
the
gift
shop,
elevators,
stairways,
corridors,
patient
rooms
and
so
forth.
this
was
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision
affirmed
by
the
board.
they
recognized
that
solicitation
could
be
prohibited,
however
after
the
amendments
were
enacted
in
1974,
a-year-and-a-half
later,
despite
the
fact
that
the
board
conceded
before
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
st.
john's
case,
that
guyan
valley
represented
an
accurate
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
amendments
went
into
effect.
a-year-and-a-half
later,
in
the
st.
john's
decision,
the
board's
st.
john's
decision,
the
board
without
articulating
any
reason
for
departing
from
the
guyan
valley
analysis,
without
medical
evidence,
without
any
medical
expertise,
reversed
its
position
and
they
ruled
that
although
special
conditions
exist
in
a
hospital
that
although
a
tranquil
atmosphere
is
essential
to
a
hospital's
primary
function
of
providing
patient
care,
and
that
although
solicitation
might
be
unsettling
to
patients
in
strictly
patient
care
areas
that
solicitation
could
have
no
adverse
effect
on
patients
in
other
areas
such
as
cafeterias,
lounges
and
alike.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
the
guyan
valley
was
a
for
profit
hospital
and
was
covered
by
the
act,
and
congress
in
amending
the
act
to
include
nonprofit
hospitals
said
that
"at
least
the
same
treatment
should
be
afforded
to
employees
and
hospitals
as
under
the
prior
legislation".
and
what
has
happened
here
is
the
congress
added
safeguards
because
of
the
taking
of
jurisdiction
over
the
nonproprietary
hospital
involving
specific
amendments
to
statutes
involving
--
getting
federal
mediation
involved
earlier,
strike
notices
and
so
forth,
but
they
did
not
give
recognition
to
the
already
existing
state
of
the
law.
congress
realized
that
the
same
condition
should
apply
and
they
stated
as
much.
in
the
congressional
record,
there
is
ample
support
for
the
proposition
that
at
least
the
same
rights
for
proprietary
hospital
should
continue
in
effect
plus
additional
safeguards.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
am
challenging
the
notion
of
not
applying
at
least
the
same
standard
that
is
applied
in
a
customer
access
area
of
a
retail
store
to
a
hospital
setting
where
patients
are
involved
and
where
congress
in
amending
the
act
to
include
nonprofit
hospitals
specifically
stated
that
the
board
in
treating
these
situations
should
give
special
attention
to
the
needs
of
patients.
so
it
seems
to
be
more
necessary
to
look
at
patients'
needs
in
a
hospital
environment
than
to
look
at
customers
needs
in
a
retail
store
environment.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
correct.
i
am
challenging
the
disparate
treatment
of
the
board
in
a
retail
context
and
a
hospital
context
where
in
the
hospital
context,
we
have
specific
guidance
from
congress
that
patients
should
be
treated
specially.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
i
do
your
honor
and
this
is
a
case
which
involves
a
hospital
cafeteria
with
the
substantial
number
of
patients
and
visitors
that
use
that
cafeteria
and
they
are
just
as
much
customers
of
this
cafeteria.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
a
second
position
that
the
hospital
asserts
your
honor.
first,
we
feel
that
the
retail
store
precedent
should
be
applied
in
this
case
because
patients
are
involved.
a
hospital
is
a
special
circumstance
in
and
of
itself
and
that
need
interest
should
be
protected
to
insulate
patients
from
potentially
disruptive
influences.
secondly,
this
is
a
cafeteria
and
cafeterias
outside
of
hospital
setting
have
been
given
this
kind
of
protection
against
union
solicitation.
mr.
louis
chandler
they
may
sit
around
the
tables.
they
may
intermingle
with
patients
and
visitors.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
between
employee
only
cafeterias
and
public
cafeterias.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
goldblatt
case
which
is
a
board
decision
dating
back
to
1948
involving
a
department
store.
the
board
applied
its
retail
store
precedent
to
the
department
store's
cafeteria
which
was
used
by
employees
and
customers
and
there
is
no
indication
--
mr.
louis
chandler
that
was
a
department
store
rule.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
the
department
store
has
a
cafeteria
on
the
premises
and
that
is
used
by
employees
as
well
as
customers.
and
the
board
in
that
case
says
that
not
only
is
the
selling
function
of
the
department
store
at
stake
but
the
rapport
of
customers
who
happen
to
eat
in
that
area.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
that
your
honor.
in
the
boards
mcdonald's
restaurant
case
which
is
sited
in
the
brief,
the
board
has
said
from
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision
--
mr.
louis
chandler
they
were
--
employees
working
in
that
cafeteria.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
are
employees
at
the
hospital
however
your
honor
that
work
in
that
cafeteria
that
could
be
distracted.
this
is
a
work
area
as
well
as
a
--
mr.
louis
chandler
i
do
not
have
that
information,
it
is
not
on
the
record.
mr.
louis
chandler
it
is
for
the
employees
that
do
not
work
in
the
cafeteria.
it
is
also
for
the
patients
and
visitors
of
the
hospital.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
chandler
it
is
no
more
different
than
the
goldblatt
case
which
is
also
a
cafeteria
where
there
are
fewer
employees
working.
there
are
off
duty
employees
and
there
are
customers
that
share
that
facility
and
the
board
in
that
situation
has
applied
the
rule
that
we
would
ask
them
to
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
chandler
that
was
a
department
store
that
had
a
restaurant
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
i
indicated
that
this
is
also
a
work
area.
there
are
employees
at
the
hospital
that
work
in
the
cafeteria.
the
board
in
st.
john's
moved
away
from
this
guyan
valley
principle
and
they
said
that
only
non-ambulatory
patients
or
patients
who
are
confined
to
their
rooms
and
to
immediate
care
areas
or
treatment
rooms
are
entitled
to
the
protection
from
union
solicitation
distribution,
that
other
patients
who
are
ambulatory
are
better
able
to
endure
the
unsettling
effects
which
the
board
recognizes
that
might
be
the
case
in
the
immediate
patient
care
areas.
the
board
apparently
has
rendered
its
expert
judgment
that
the
unsettling
effects
of
such
solicitation
and
distribution
for
some
reason
are
suspended
while
a
psychiatric
patient
is
in
the
cafeteria
with
his
family
awaiting
psychiatric
treatment
or
a
cancer
outpatient.
mr.
louis
chandler
we
recommend
that
the
solicitation
be
allowed
in
employee
only
areas
of
the
hospital.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
are
locker
rooms
and
adjacent
restrooms
in
the
hospital
and
outside
of
the
hospital.
mr.
louis
chandler
outside
of
the
hospital.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
your
honor
outside
of
the
hospital
on
public
grounds
that
the
hospital
has
no
control
over.
i
would
not
--
mr.
louis
chandler
but
the
hospital
has
no
control
over
what
may
happen
on
public
property.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
think
there
is
a
less
of
a
risk
involved,
becuase
there
is
--
mr.
louis
chandler
there
is
some
risk
but
there
is
a
balance
your
honor
that
has
to
be
made.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
believe
so
in
that
context,
yes
your
honor.
in
the
cafeteria,
no
because
there
are
patients
who
regardless
of
whether
they
are
able
to
walk
to
the
cafeteria
maybe
quite
ill
and
are
in
need
of
protection
and
insulation
and
in
need
of
an
environment
to
help
them
cope.
mr.
louis
chandler
most
inpatients
your
honor.
there
are
eight
times
as
many
outpatients
as
in
patients
in
the
hospital
according
to
the
record
evidence
and
there
are
400
beds
in
the
hospital
so
there
are
substantially
more
outpatients
who
may
coming
off
the
street
for
--
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
they
may
while
they
are
awaiting
--
mr.
louis
chandler
the
board
has
held
that
it
is
disruptive
to
organize
in
public
areas
in
other
cases
not
in
hospital
cases.
they
have
held
it
in
the
guyan
valley
case.
our
position
is
they
should
hold
that
in
this
case
as
well
where
you
have
patience
involved
and
patient
access
areas
that
their
rule
this
distinction
between
ambulatory
and
non-ambulatory
is
not
supported.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
are
substantial
number
of
customers,
however,
based
upon
the
figures
that
are
in
the
evidence
on
an
annual
basis
for
over
54,000
patients
and
their
families,
visitors
who
use
that
cafeteria
just
to
purchase
meals,
and
in
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge
which
is
appended
to
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
in
a
related
case,
he
found
that
patients
use
the
cafeteria
for
visiting
children
and
not
necessarily
to
purchase
meals,
so
there
could
be
a
substantially
greater
number
than
the
54,000.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
have
here
a
situation
where
congress
has
spoken.
congress
has
said
that
special
attention
must
be
given
to
the
needs
of
patients,
and
our
position
is
that
the
board
has
not
recognized
the
special
needs.
not
only
because
of
the
retail
store
exception
but
because
the
hospital
is
a
special
circumstance,
it
is
a
unique
environment
and
should
be
given
special
attention.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
thank
you.
briefly
there
are
several
points
in
reply.
the
record
appendix
verifies
that
there
are
approximately
700
lockers
in
just
four
of
locker
areas
to
which
all
of
that
beth
israel
employees
have
access.
secondly,
brother
counsel
stated
that
the
board's
rule
is
a
rule
prohibiting
solicitation
during
work
time
is
presumptively
valid.
what
he
neglected
to
say
was
that
the
board
rule
also
says
it
is
presumptively
valid
to
prohibit
solicitation
in
work
areas
and
public
or
customer
access
areas.
here
the
beth
israel
cafeteria
apart
from
being
a
place
where
employees
are
working
is
a
customer
access
area
and
the
customers
here
happen
to
be
patients
and
their
families.
at
the
very
least
the
hospital
is
entitled
to
the
same
consideration.
the
question
of
numbers
has
been
raised.
the
board
has
never
raised
question
of
how
many
customers
are
in
a
particular
area
in
an
elevator
of
a
department
store
or
in
a
cafeteria
in
a
department
store.
we
see
no
reason
to
apply
it
in
a
cafeteria
setting
especially
here
where
there
are
substantial
numbers.
the
primary
function
that
brother
counsel
mentioned
that
apply
in
the
retail
store
i
cite
again
the
goldblatt
case
because
in
that
case
because
in
that
case
the
primary
function
was
selling
merchandise
cafeteria
and
that
case
was
not
for
selling
merchandise
or
was
with
selling
food
and
adjunct
to
that
operation.
in
the
remand
that
brother
counsel
referred
to
in
the
related
beth
israel
case,
the
administrator
law
judge
made
certain
findings
of
fact
and
i
would
read
from
the
addendum
in
the
brief.
solicitation
and
distribution
--
mr.
louis
chandler
this
is
on
page
49.
"solicitation
and
distribution
in
patient
access
areas
can
interfere
with
patient
care
functions.
such
activity
can
be
disturbing
to
patients
and
their
families.
persons
who
are
particularly
susceptible
to
being
disturbed
such
disturbance
can
interfere
with
beth
israel's
primary
function
of
curing
illness."
however,
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
was
bound
by
the
board's
rule
in
st.
john's
not
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
which
reversed
the
board's
rule.
curiously,
the
board
in
the
mcdonald's
hamburger
case
apply
the
restaurant
rule
by
saying
and
i
quote
from
the
decision
of
the
board.
"union
solicitation
can
lead
to
heated
verbal
exchanges
among
the
solicitors
and
those
solicited.
indeed
it
is
certainly
not
unknown
for
violent
physical
exchanges
to
occur
in
such
circumstances
should
such
that
be
in
the
presence
of
customers
would
not
be
unlikely
the
employer
can
well
foresee
the
destruction
of
the
rapport
which
this
employer
and
any
normal
employer
would
like
to
have
with
its
customers."
mr.
louis
chandler
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
would
it
be
a
crime?
mr.
louis
chandler
you
are
right
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
no,
we
do
not
your
honor,
but
the
board
has
recognized
in
a
retail
store
setting
and
a
restaurant
setting
that
solicitation
can
be
disruptive,
and
if
they
give
that
kind
of
consideration
in
the
mcdonald's
hamburger
place
we
would
expect
that
they
would
be
able
to
apply
that
same
logic
to
a
hospital
setting.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
would
hope
that
this
case
where
there
is
express
congressional
intent
to
give
the
needs
of
the
patient's
special
attention
that
this
would
be
the
case
where
the
board
has
acted
contrary
to
that
congressional
intent
and
where
the
court
should
strike
them
down
as
did
the
tenth
circuit
and
dc
circuit
courts
in
the
st.
john's
and
baylor
cases.
i
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
first
circuit's
decision
as
did
those
circuit
courts
of
the
same
reasoning.
mr.
louis
chandler
yes.
mr.
louis
chandler
the
rule
was
applied
to
controversial
solicitation
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
pardon
me.
mr.
louis
chandler
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
rule
originated
when
certain
political
activity
was
occurring
in
the
hospital
involving
the
vietnam
war
and
demonstrations.
that
was
one
reason
for
banning
that
kind
of
activity.
the
hospital,
i
am
talking
about
medical
people
who
make
a
determination
as
to
what
may
be
detrimental
to
patients
in
a
hospital
setting,
made
a
determination
consistent
with
the
board's
own
case
law
that
union
solicitation
is
potentially
disruptive.
they
have
indicated
to
doctors.
the
hospital
has
indicated
to
its
staff
not
to
discuss
concerns
inpatient
access
areas
that
could
affect
patients
and
this
is
a
consistent
concern.
the
baylor
court
and
the
dc
circuit
has
recognized
that
this
is
controversial
material
that
should
be
banned
as
opposed
to
innocuous
things,
and
unless
the
board
shows
that
the
hospital's
administration
has
made
a
bad
medical
judgment,
then
we
see
no
basis
for
the
board
to
insist
upon
a
new
rule.
as
this
court
determined
recently
in
the
university
of
missouri
case
against
horowitz.
that
involved
the
academic
field,
but
there
they
recognized
that
academic
people
are
better
able
to
make
determinations
as
to
academic
problems
and
subject
matter
than
the
courts
or
administrative
agencies.
here
we
would
suggest
that
the
same
principle
applies
in
a
medical
field
especially
where
there
was
no
medical
evidence
or
medical
testimony
other
than
the
board's
own
medical
perceptions
that
supports
this
distinction
for
ambulatory
as
against
non-ambulatory.
mr.
louis
chandler
your
honor
at
the
time
the
hearing
arose
the
board
case
precedent
was
established.
as
indicated
earlier,
it
was
the
guyan
valley
precedent.
we
presented
evidence
that
patients
and
visitors
were
present
and
that
solicitation
activity
occur.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
do
not
believe
you
need
to
pass
on
that
your
honor
because
of
the
mere
presence
of
the
customers
in
a
patient
access
area
of
just
as
in
the
retail
store.
this
presents
a
special
circumstance.
mr.
louis
chandler
in
the
cafeteria
there
was
solicitation
allowed.
there
were
pledged
cards
that
were
distributed
for
uniting.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
have
already
indicated
that
and
the
records
supports
it.
there
were
numerous
letters
sent
to
staff
directing
them
not
to
discuss
potentially
upsetting
things
in
the
presence
of
customers.
mr.
louis
chandler
there
were
no
signs
there
was
a
--
mr.
louis
chandler
we
said
there
are
patients
and
visitors.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
am
not
sure
i
followed
your
question
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
all
employees
may
not
solicit.
mr.
louis
chandler
anything
other
than
--
mr.
louis
chandler
that
is
right.
in
a
work
area
what
are
talking
about?
mr.
louis
chandler
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
chandler
on
the
face
of
the
rule,
no
your
honor,
you
cannot.
mr.
louis
chandler
i
believe
the
record
does
indicate
that
dr.
rabkin
who
was
the
general
director
of
the
hospital,
responsible
for
drafting
the
rule.
