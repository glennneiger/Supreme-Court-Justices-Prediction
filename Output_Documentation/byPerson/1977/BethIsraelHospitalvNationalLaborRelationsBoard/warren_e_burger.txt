chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
beth
israel
hospital
against
the
labor
board.
[conferring]
mr.
chandler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
speaking
in
this
material
you
are
reading?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
one
of
the
claims
of
the
union
based
on
what
you
read
of
their
literature
that
the
hospital
is
understaffed
and
that
is
part
of
the
union
organizing
that
if
they
get
a
union,
they
will
see
that
it
is
properly
staffed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
do
not
always
in
their
organizing
stage
emphasize
so
much
the
need
for
more
employees
as
this
literature
would
appear
up
here
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
hospital
allowed
political
candidates
to
come
in
the
restaurant
to
distribute
literature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
say
retail,
do
you
include
restaurants,
open
to
the
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
necessary
for
a
uniform
application
that
there
would
be
any
patients
or
any
family
in
the
restaurant
if
it
is
a
restaurant
in
what
just
happens
to
be
in
a
hospital?
in
other
words
if
they
cannot
go
into
the
rive
gauche
and
distribute
literature,
is
it
your
position
they
cannot
go
into
any
other
restaurant
just
because
it
happens
to
be
in
a
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
patients
are
nervous
or
the
families
are
nervous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
many
employees
do
you
have
in
the
cafeteria?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
if
it
is
like
any
other
cafeteria
there
are
employees
circulating
around
constantly
taking
away
the
trays
and
the
plates
of
customers
who
have
departed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
challenge
the
findings
that
a
significant
number
of
non-employees
use
that
cafeteria
over
a
period
of
a
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
controversial
matters,
these
communications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
were
controversial
in
any
respect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
locker
rooms
that
you
have
just
spoken
to
us
about.
why
is
not
that
a
perfectly
adiquate
place
where
no
one
has
access
except
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
any
employee
that
is
interested
can
carry
a
literature
in
there
if
he
wants
to
can't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
the
employees
of
this
hospital
use
the
same
front
entrance
that
the
patients
and
the
visitors
do,
if
so
it
is
the
first
hospital
that
i
have
ever
heard
of?
are
they
having
employees
entrance
that
has
special
access?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
400-bed
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
would
not
believe
it
unless
you
could
demonstrate
it
affirmatively
on
the
record.
it
is
just
incredible
to
suggest
that
they
do
not
have
an
employee's
entrance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
place
for
distribution
to
employees
is
at
the
employee's
entrance,
is
it
not?
that
is
where
you
are
going
to
get
the
best
traffic
for
the
purposes
of
the
union.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
when
it
is
only
77%
of
the
employees
and
the
balance
is
someone
other
than
employees,
that
is
the
figure
you
gave
as
i
understood
it.
why
should
the
balance
of
the
people
have
to
be
exposed
to
this
kind
of
activity,
anymore
than
people
walking
into
the
rive
gauche
or
the
mayflower
hotel
restaurant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
some
consideration
needs
to
be
given
to
the
patients
on
the
purpose
of
running
a
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
judge
parker
state
any
evidence
to
support
this
conclusion
or
was
that
just
some
generalization
that
occurred
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
now,
mr.
come.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
mr.
gold,
you
make
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
like
this
that
is
in
quotation
marks
if
i
may
quote
you
that
perhaps
creates
the
problem.
can
you
have
a
presumption
which
is
applied
to
factories
and
other
places
and
have
that
apply
with
the
same
force
to
the
restaurant
in
a
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
factory
as
you
know
and
i
know
and
we
all
know,
except
for
a
rare
exception
of
a
visiting
fireman,
the
only
people
lunching
are
the
employees
and
perhaps
officers
of
the
company.
here
you
have
something
that
is
open
to
28
some
percent,
23%
i
think
it
was
of
people
other
than
employees
and
the
considerations
of
the
tranquility
of
the
establishment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
(inaudible)
doctors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
can
do
that
in
the
locker
rooms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
enlarged
time
is
not
expired
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
chandler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
enlarged
your
time
to
compensate
for
your
friends.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
only
complaint
i
would
say
that
you
are
really
lying
which
is
the
complain
about
the
nlrb
being
consistent
and
then
nothing
we
have
been
able
to
do
so
far
to
compel
them
to
do
that,
so
(inaudible)
doing
on
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
should
not
solicit
to
be
repaid
the
money
they
told
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
77-152,
beth
israel
hospital
against
the
labor
board
will
be
announced

mr.
justice
brennan,
