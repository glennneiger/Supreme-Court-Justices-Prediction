mr.
chandler,
the
coffee
shop
is
closed
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
why
was
it
closed?
unknown
speaker
was
the
coffee
shop
run
by
the
hospital
per
se
or
by
some
women's
organization
04:13
or
how?
unknown
speaker
were
we
reveiwing
that
case
or
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
find
a
real
discussion
in
the
board's
order
in
this
case
or
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision
by
the
way?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
any
discussion
by
the
board
or
the
administrative
law
judge
about
such
a
balance
as
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
did
you
recite
the
contentions
of
the
parties
that
is
about
--
it
does
not
tell
me
where
he
comes
to
a
real
finding
except
on
page
42.
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
treat
this
cafeteria
different
than
a
cafeteria
in
a
retail
store?
unknown
speaker
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board
certainly
did
not
discuss
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
so
we
should
read
it
up
at
that
decision
and
incorporate
that
discussion
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
retail
store
or
anything
separate.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
a
substantial
evidence
problem?
put
that
way
is,
it
is
a
statutory
construction
problem?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
legal
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
two:
it
does
not
proceed
within
its
statutory
to
hardly
state
and
presumption,
and
secondly,
if
it
may
state
one,
it
is
also
a
second
legal
question
whether
this
is
a
proper
one
as
they
have
created
it
here.
unknown
speaker
and
those
are
legal
questions,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
so
we
do
not
get
into
universal
camera
types
of
inquiries
for
judicial
review
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
tell
me
mr.
gold,
if
we
agree
that
the
presumption
was
proper
then
we
still
have
to
determine
that
whether
its
application
on
the
factual
record
here
that
was
proper
in
the
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
particularly
with
relation
to
this
st.
john's,
about
the
judge
campbell
cause
a
puzzling
footnote?
unknown
speaker
and
our
findings
as
to
that?
unknown
speaker
he
has
a
long
discussion,
but
i
have
the
tough
time
in
identifying
any
findings
excep
that
page
42.
unknown
speaker
will
you
get
to
that
summary,
mr.
gold
to
summarize.
is
that
where
we
find
the
findings
based
on
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
chandler,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
was
the
rule
against
solicitation
apply
to
all
solicitation
or
just
to
union
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
defined?
