justice
thurgood
marshall
does
this
case
involve
patients'
rooms?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
just
said
room.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
not
you
not
give
a
very
simple
answer
to
my
brother
stewart,
that
most
employees
that
handle
the
food
in
the
cafeteria
know
better
than
to
eat
that.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case
they
were
not
passing
out
this
literature
to
the
employees
of
the
cafeteria,
were
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
employees
of
the
hotel,
i
mean
of
the
hospital,
but
not
the
ones
in
the
cafeteria
that
is
my
brother
stewart's
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
first
of
all,
when
you
have
about
50
times
that
many
seats
so
it
is
obviously
not
for
them.
it
is
for
the
employees
that
do
not
work
in
the
cafeteria.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
who
also
do
not
work
in
the
cafeteria.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
point,
that
is
a
little
different.
it
is
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
outpatients
go
to
the
hospital
cafeteria
indeed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
are
not
held
there
for
psychiatric
treatment.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
mr.
chandler
you
keep
saying
that
the
board
does
not
follow
its
own
precedents,
is
that
your
complete
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
red
cross.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
restrooms
you
have
got
restrooms.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
conceive
how
you
pass
them
out.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
entrance
to
the
hospital?
i
mean
every
employee
does
not
have
to
go
to
the
cafeteria,
but
every
employee
does
have
to
come
in
the
door.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
is
all
cafeterias
except
those
in
hospitals
under
one
roof?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
cafeterias
in
retail
establishments?
all
other
than
hospitals
are
covered
but
the
hospitals
are
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
participated
in
a
labor
controversy
helps
people
to
get
well.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
the
same
things
that
is
in
those
pamphlets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gold
the
one
thing
worries
me
if
we
agree
me
with
you,
how
do
we
explain
away
the
retail
store?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
that
be
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be
a
crime
to
fight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
it
would
be
a
crime.
you
take
care
of
that
one
separate.
call
in
the
police
and
arresting
the
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
solves
that
problem.
wouldn't
that
to
solve
that
with
nlrb
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chandler,
my
brother
powell's
question
that
you
and
i
did
not
understand
it,
so
let
me
try
again.
in
this
case
limited
to
this
hospital
was
any
other
solicitation,
other
than
unions,
barred?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
not
said
a
word
about
what
was
allowed.
i
am
asking
what
else
was
prohibited
other
than
union
solicitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
they
signs
of
no
solicitations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
you
say
no
solicitation.
what
did
you
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
you
mean?
who
did
you
mean
should
not
solicit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
included
in
the
phrase
no
solicitation?
who
was
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anything?
