mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
much
of
my
brother's
argument
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
when
congress
enacted
the
healthcare
amendments
of
1974
and
brought
non-profit
hospitals
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
it
somehow
mandated
the
board
to
restrict
solicitation
and
distribution
by
employees
in
an
organizational
context.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
and
those
amendments
shows
quite
contrary
that
congress
intended
to
leave
it
to
the
board's
discretion
to
continue
the
exercise
its
preexisting
responsibility
to
accommodate
employee's
organizational
rights
and
the
employer's
management
interest
which
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
is
to
maintain
patient
care.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
findings
of
the
board
which
were
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
are
based
upon
a
survey
hospital
conducted
that
appear
at
record
appendix
124
shows
that
employees
purchase
77%
of
the
meals
served
in
this
cafeteria,
visitors
9%,
and
patients
only
1.56%.
the
remainder
of
the
meals
were
purchased
by
students,
volunteers,
doctors,
nurses,
and
others.
there
is
no
employee
only
facility
in
this
hospital.
the
hospital's
employees'
handbook
states
that
a
modern
cafeteria
is
provided
for
all
employees
where
a
nutritious
well
prepared
meal
is
maybe
purchased
at
reasonable
prices.
in
short,
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
this
hospital
cafeteria
is
primarily
a
employee
eating
facility
that
hospital
held
out
to
its
employees
as
such,
and
indeed
it
has
used
the
cafeteria
area
to
communicate
with
employees
concerning
hospital
programs
and
is
permitted
employees
to
obtain
literature
there
concerning
a
variety
of
commercial
matters.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
they
were
not
union
organizational
matters.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
trial
examiner,
at
petitioners
appendix
33,
indicates
the
nature
of
them.
the
poster
is
publicizing
the
hospitals
buck
a
day
a
cost
reduction
program,
travel
brochure,
a
rat
carpool
board,
literature
concerning
nutritional
ideas,
commercial
literature
relating
the
tennis
camps,
film
processing,
magazine
subscriptions,
united
fund
and
combined
jewish
philanthropies
drives
and
things
of
that
sort.
the
point
is
though
that
whether
hospital
drew
the
line
was
at
solicitation
and
literature
relating
to
union
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
your
honor
that
although
some
of
this
literature
perhaps
gets
to
the
outer
fringes,
it
is
still
a
probe
test
working
conditions
and
often
union
literature
on
that
subject
is
not
for
exactly
the
language
of
the
filer.
now
the
court
of
appeals
found
reading
from
petitioner's
appendix
55,
beth
israel
argues
that
its
no
distribution
rule
will
prevent
the
union's
scoreless
attacks
and
quotes
and
the
hospital's
healthcare
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
patients.
there
was
no
evidence
however
that
literature
offensive
or
otherwise
was
distributed
to
patients
or
visitors.
employee
schunior
testified
that
she
took
care
to
distribute
only
to
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
all
that
the
record
shows
what
employee
schunior
distributed
and
what
she
was
disciplined
for.
i
think
that
the
rest
of
it
is
speculation
as
the
court
of
appeals
so
finds
here,
and
as
the
court
goes
on
to
add
that
if
in
the
future
in
fact
scoreless
or
offensive
literature
is
distributed,
the
remedy
is
to
ban
that
kind
of
literature
or
to
discipline
employees
for
distributing
that
kind
of
literature
not
to
ban
all
of
it,
and
that
is
what
the
hospital
has
got
here.
it
has
got
a
total
ban
on
the
distribution
of
any
union
literature
even
the
most
innocuous
or
any
union
solicitation
in
any
area
of
the
hospital
other
than
the
employee
only
areas
and
the
only
employee
only
areas
here
were
the
locker
rooms
which
on
the
findings
of
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
the
restrooms.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
restrooms
were
joining
the
locker
rooms
as
i
understand
it.
but
on
the
findings
of
the
board
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
these
locker
rooms
were
not
open
to
all
employees
and
they
were
segregated
by
sex
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
even
the
hospital
use
the
locker
rooms
or
bulletin
boards
and
some
of
the
locker
rooms
when
it
found
it
necessary
to
communicate
with
the
employees,
and
either
did
so
by
posting
bulletins
in
the
cafeteria
or
by
giving
them
fliers
in
conjunction
with
there
paychecks,
so
that
the
long
in
short
of
it
is
that
if
the
employee
organizes
--
and
we
are
not
talking
about
outside
organizers
we
are
talking
about
employees
of
the
hospital
--
are
not
free
to
engage
in
orderly
solicitation
of
their
fellow
employees
who
are
off
duty
and
distribute
literature
to
them
at
that
time
in
the
cafeteria.
there
is
no
other
place
in
this
hospital
second
where
these
employees
organizers
can
get
their
message
across
to
their
fellow
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
those
locker
rooms
are
not
open
to
all
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
every
employee
can
get
access
to
those
locker
rooms.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
hospital's
rule
as
i
understand
it
also
preclude
the
distribution
of
literature
in
front
of
the
hospital
and
as
a
matter
a
fact
in
the
second
board
case
involving
the
beth
israel
hospital
which
is
still
pending
before
the
board.
three
employees
were
disciplined
for
handing
out
literature
right
in
front
of
the
entrance
of
the
hospital.
mr.
norton
j.
come
so
far
as
the
record
show
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
such
restriction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
maybe
an
employees
entrance
but
in
so
far
as
the
record
shows
there
is
no
indication
that
they
are
confined
to
entering
the
hospital
through
that
entrance.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
certainly
not
the
rule
with
respect
to
other
establishments.
the
board
is
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
balancing
the
employee's
organizational
rights
against
the
employer's
property
rights.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
place
of
work
is
the
place
that
is
uniquely
appropriate
for
the
employees
to
obtain
such
information.
going
as
far
back
as
republic
aviation,
the
court
approved
of
the
board's
presumptions
that
working
time
is
for
work
and
therefore
a
rule
barring
employee
solicitation
and
distribution
during
working
time
is
presumptively
invalid
but
by
the
same
token,
non-working
time
is
the
employees
own
time
and
therefore
a
rule
barring
solicitation
and
distribution
during
that
time
is
presumptively
invalid
absent
the
showing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
an
accommodation
has
to
be
made
between
the
organizational
rights
of
the
employees
and
those
of
the
hospital.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
and
the
boards
st.
john's
principle
in
which
the
board
attempted
to
accommodate
the
general
republic
aviation
principles
to
the
special
needs
of
the
hospital
is
an
effort
to
make
such
an
accommodation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
are
reviewing
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
line
that
st.
john's
draws
is
between
patient
care
areas
and
other
areas
of
the
hospital
to
which
patient's
may
have
the
access.
i
think
that
the
only
issue
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
cafeteria,
that
is
admittedly
not
a
patient
care
area
but
it
is
an
area
to
which
patients
have
access,
and
the
question
is
whether
balancing
the
needs
of
the
employees
for
obtaining
information
concerning
union
activity
in
the
cafeteria
against
the
possible
harm
to
the
patient
care
function
of
the
hospital,
the
board
was
reasonable
in
drawing
the
accommodation
in
favor
of
the
employee
rights.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
the
administrate
law
judge's
decision
is
replete
with
such
discussion,
your
honor
beginning
on
pages
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
42
is
his
ultimate
conclusion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
right,
i
think
we
come
down
to
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
discussed
it
in
the
st.
john's
decision
which
the
board
referred
to
in
a
footnote
in
this
case
in
affirming
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
so
far
as
the
distinction
between
a
retail
cafeteria
and
a
hospital
cafeteria
is
concerned
and
the
essence
of
the
distinction
is
this:
the
board
has
got
obviously
in
the
exercise
of
this
discretion
that
it
has,
make
this
accommodation
in
the
light
of
the
different
situations
that
you
have
in
different
industries.
this
is
a
difficult
problem
that
requires
a
lot
of
fine
tuning,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
congress
left
it
to
the
board
subject
of
course
to
judicial
review.
the
board
has
always
had
the
view
that
an
employee
cafeteria
in
an
industrial
plant
for
example,
there
was
a
right
to
solicit
and
distribute
on
nonworking
time.
on
the
other
hand,
the
board,
with
respect
to
a
commercial
restaurant
has
found
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
to
permit
solicitation
or
distribution
there,
involved
too
great
a
likelihood
of
disrupting
the
main
function
of
the
commercial
enterprise
which
was
to
serve
customers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
not
the
cafeterias
in
industrial
plants.
mr.
norton
j.
come
hospitals
are
not
covered
because
the
board
believes
that
to
permit
solicitation
by
fellow
employees
and
distribution
in
such
facilities
is
not
likely
to
interfere
with
the
function
of
the
hospital.
it
is
not
likely
to
interfere
with
patient
care.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
judge
white
had
pointed
out
in
the
lutheran
hospital
case,
which
did
sustain
the
board,
in
this
day
and
age,
patients
are
not
likely
to
be
upset
by
overhearing
discussion
of
union
activity
any
more
than
they
would
be
by
overhearing
doctors
and
nurses
who
talk
in
a
cafeteria
about
operations
or
diseases
or
the
normal
things
that
are
likely.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
did
not
cite
any
evidence
but
there
your
honor,
i
think
we
get
back
to
the
point
that
this
court
made
in
republic
aviation
namely
that
the
board
is
entitled
in
drawing
up
these
rules
as
to
the
proper
balance
between
employee
and
management
rights
to
draw
reasonable
inferences
based
upon
its
experience
in
this
area
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
board
rule
to
be
sustained
to
have
evidence
that
would
establish
the
results
of
the
particular
rules.
i
mean,
they
have
to
be
reasonable.
