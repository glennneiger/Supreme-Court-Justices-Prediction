justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chandler,
i
do
not
claim
to
be
an
expert
on
union
organizing
tactics
but
this
does
not
strike
me
as
the
ordinary
union
organizing
literature
which
would
be
urging
claims
for
added
benefits
or
criticizing
in
some
other
way
than
this.
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
suggests
why
this
sort
of
criticism
was
resorted
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chandler,
do
you
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
a
patient
would
upset
by
a
leaflet
that
said,
"beth
israel
employees
get
only
so
much
an
hour,
peter
bent
brigham
employees
get
10%
more",
do
you
think
that
would
upset
a
patient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
board
have
jurisdiction
over
guyan
valley
because
it
was
a
for
profit
hospital?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
on
how
high
a
level
of
abstraction
you
want
to
reach
in
answering
my
brother
white's
question.
if
you
complain
that
the
board
is
not
applying
the
same
standards
to
hospitals
as
it
is
to
retail
stores,
you
are,
in
effect,
complaining
about
the
standard
that
the
board
has
adopted,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
goldblatt
a
restaurant
or
a
department
store
which
had
a
restaurant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
presume
there
would
be
some
employees
from
other
branches
of
the
store
than
the
cafeteria
who
ate
in
the
cafeteria?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
come
following
up
a
little
bit
on
the
chief
justice's
question.
the
leaflets
described
by
mr.
chandler
in
his
opening
arguments,
if
this
case
is
to
depend
on
facts
at
all
and
perhaps
it
should
not,
it
seems
to
present
the
very
worst
possible
situation
for
the
union's
position
and
the
board's
position.
a
good
deal
or
worse,
i
would
think
normal
the
organizing
tactics
would
present.
is
there
anything
in
the
board's
record
that
suggests
why
the
union
resorted
to
this
type
of
statements
in
its
organizing
campaign?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
in
a
department
store
restaurant,
presumably
a
number
of
employees
with
the
various
departments
would
eat.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
do
you
view
this
primarily
as
a
review
of
a
rule
making
proceeding
or
as
an
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
substantial
evidence
considered
on
a
rule?
