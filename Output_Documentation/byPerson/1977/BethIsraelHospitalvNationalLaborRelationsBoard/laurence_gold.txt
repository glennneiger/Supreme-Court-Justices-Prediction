mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
continuing
with
the
point
that
mr.
come
was
making,
i
think
it
is
important
to
stress
that
this
case
brings
to
this
court
a
question
concerning
the
validity
of
certain
basic
rules
presumption
that
the
board
has
stated.
one
of
those
presumptions
is
that
employee
solicitation
and
distribution
of
union
literature
in
nonworking
areas
and
during
nonworking
times
is
presumptively
lawful.
it
is
a
presumption,
the
hospital
in
any
case
can
seek
to
overcome
that
presumption.
in
this
case,
the
hospital
did
not
seek
to
overcome
that
presumption
with
any
facts.
what
it
did
was
say
that
the
rules
here
should
be
presumptively
lawful.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
believe
that
it
is
of
an
adjudication.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right,
in
other
words,
the
board
has,
at
least
since
the
republic
aviation
case,
followed
this
approach
of
stating
a
presumption
and
then
litigating
the
applicability
of
the
presumption
in
particular
cases.
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
that
break
for
lunch,
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
basic
board
rule
here
is
in
the
form
of
a
presumption,
restrictions
on
union
solicitation
and
union
distribution
in
a
cafeteria
like
this,
says
the
board,
is
presumptively
unlawful.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
what
the
board
has
done
is
say
that
in
certain
areas,
rules
are
presumptively
lawful
and
others
presumptively
unlawful,
and
the
burden
--
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
the
figures
are
that
employees
and
other
staff
comprise
89%
of
the
customers
and
there
are
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
the
doctors
would
be
disturbed
nor
does
the
hospital
argue
it,
and
so
the
question
is
whether
the
1.5%
patients
and
10%
guests
argue
for
a
different
presumption.
i
think
that
the
board
preceded
perfectly,
rationally
in
the
following
sense.
there
are
two
lines
of
cases
as
we
have
developed
and
contrary
to
the
impression
created
by
the
petitioner
that
there
is
one.
line
one
says
that
where
you
have
an
employee
only
cafeteria,
a
restriction
to
this
type
is
presumptively
unlawful.
presumption
number
two
says
that
where
the
facility
is
primarily
for
the
general
public,
such
rules
are
presumptively
lawful.
and
what
the
board
did
here
was
to
say
that
to
begin
this
process
as
a
working
hypothesis,
we
will
say
that
this
rule
is
presumptively
unlawful
and
put
the
burden
on
the
hospital
which
after
all
claims
to
have
the
medical
expertise
to
show
that
there
are
special
circumstances
which
make
the
rule
lawful,
and
the
hospital
did
not
accept
that
invitation
instead,
they
argued
what
the
board's
presumption
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
think
that
that
places
a
very
heavy
burden
on
them
under
this
court's
general
law
regarding
the
review
of
administrative
agency
determinations
and
that
they
have
not
begun
to
carry
it.
first
of
all
as
we
have
been
discussing
--
mr.
laurence
gold
there
are
two
steps.
that
is
right.
first
is
the
did
the
board
proceed
properly
in
stating
this
presumption?
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
and
then
if
it
did
--
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
problem
for
factories
and
other
facilities
as
in
republic
aviation
where
this
court
answered
the
first
question
you
posed,
yes,
the
board
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
okay.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
footnote
is
in
our
view
basically
--
the
puzzling
aspect
of
the
footnote
is
basically
out
of
the
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
except
as
to
the
cafeteria,
there
has
not
been
a
sufficient
articulation
of
the
board's
theory
sent
all
other
aspects
of
the
case
back
and
the
board
accepted
the
remand.
so
what
we
have
here
is
the
application
of
the
board's
presumption
to
this
cafeteria
and
the
administrative
--
mr.
laurence
gold
the
administrative
law
judge's
findings,
i
apologize,
i
do
not
have
the
petition.
i
have
the
decision,
are
set
forth
at
length
at
220
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
would
say
that
beginning
at
the
portion
of
the
decision
at
223
nlrb
1197,
and
continuing
through
the
end
of
1198,
the
administrative
law
judge
considers
each
of
the
factors
which
were
argued
namely
the
effect
on
patients,
the
discrimination
point
which
i
would
like
to
stress
the
availability
of
access
to
people
elsewhere,
he
reviews
each
aspect
of
the
record
and
says
that
in
this
situation,
the
presumption
was
not
overcome.
as
to
the
discrimination
point
which
i
guess
will
be
the
only
thing
and
if
i
can
have
even
one
minute
on
that
we
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
administrative
law
judge
found,
the
board
accepted
the
finding
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it
as
well
that
the
employer
put
a
greater
restraint
on
communications
concerning
union
activity
than
on
any
other
type
of
communication
in
one
of
the
best
settled
rules
here,
and
we
think
one
which
is
plainly
derived
from
the
act
itself
which
protects
discussion
of
union
activity
and
other
matters
concerning
mutual
aid
and
protection
but
does
not
protect
charity
drives
or
discussions
of
sporting
events
or
public
affairs
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
sustain
the
finding
here.
this
is
not
a
normal
cafeteria.
it
is
not
like
rive
gauche,
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
pictures
at
pages
111
through
114.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
this
was
my
point
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
the
retail
store
the
basic
function
of
the
cafeteria
of
the
store
is
to
serve
the
general
public.
here
the
basic
function
of
this
cafeteria
was
to
serve
the
employees.
you
would
not
walk
in
to
a
general
public
facility
and
find
slogans
addressed
to
the
employees
bad
means
save
a
buck
a
day
or
you
would
not
find
bulletin
boards,
table
setup
for
the
employees.
the
employer's
actions
here
demonstrate
that
this
was
basically
a
place
used
by
employees
and
other
staff
and
was
the
place
at
which
employees
spoke
to
each
other.
after
all
union
solicitation
distribution
sound
like
archaic
terms,
but
what
they
are,
are
people
talking
to
each
other
or
people
reading
literature
or
exchanging
literature.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
as
mr.
come
endeavored
to
indicate
mr.
chief
justice
only
a
third
of
the
locker
rooms
are
open
to
employees
generally.
the
other
locker
rooms
are
open
only
to
the
employees
who
have
a
locker
in
that
particular
facility
and
what
the
employers
rule
does
in
this
instance
is
to
close
off
communication
between
somewhere
around
2/3rds
of
the
employees
because
what
he
wants
to
do
is
to
say
that
any
place
you
ever
find
a
patient,
it
is
improper
for
employees
to
be
discussing
unionization
whether
or
not
they
are
working.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
i
apologize
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
