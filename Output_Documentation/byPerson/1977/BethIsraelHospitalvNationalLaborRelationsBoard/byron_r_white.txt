are
you
suggesting
that
the
board
has
the
wrong
standard
in
these
kinds
of
cases
or
are
you
just
challenging
the
application
of
an
accepted
standard
in
this
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
then
challenging
the
application
of
the
rule
that
has
evolved
to
the
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
news
in
the
cafeteria
was
only
minimal
by
the
patients,
and
i
take
it
here
it
is
not
a
very
high
percentage
of
patients
or
at
least
not
a
very
high
percentage
of
the
customers
or
patients.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
put
in
any
evidence
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
this
medical
judgment
did
you
think
that
will
be
left
to
the
doctors?
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
about
it.
