justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
do
have
--
to
that
extent,
we
have
a
judicial
review
of
factual
determination?
that
is
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
do
not
have
too
much
time
but
if
you
do,
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
give
a
few
seconds
to
tell
us
where
are
the
factual
findings
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
was
that
defined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
case,
77-152,
captioned
beth
israel
hospital
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
that
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
enforced
so
much
of
an
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
required
beth
israel,
a
non-profit
hospital,
whose
employees
came
under
the
protection
of
national
labor
relations
act
only
in
1974
when
that
act
was
amended
to
bring
employees
of
non-profit
hospitals
within
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
the
order
which
required
the
hospital
to
rescind
a
rule,
prohibiting
its
employees
from
soliciting
union
support
and
distributing
union
literature
during
nonworking
time
in
the
hospital
cafeteria
and
in
adjoining
coffee
shop.
the
cafeteria
was
patronized
primarily
by
employees,
but
also
by
patients
and
by
visitors
to
the
hospital.
a
survey
conducted
by
the
hospital
itself
revealed
that
77%
of
the
cafeteria's
patrons
were
employees,
only
9%
were
visitors
and
only
one-and-a-half
%
were
patients.
and
the
evidence
was
also
that
although
petitioner
employees
approximately
2200
regular
employees,
this
hospital
incidentally
is
in
boston,
access
the
most
of
those
employees
was
possible
only
in
the
cafeteria
which
was
in
effect
the
only
common
gathering
room
at
the
hospital
set
aside
for
employees.
well,
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
the
hospital's
rule
violated
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
the
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
only
insofar
as
the
rule
applied
to
the
cafeteria,
and
for
reasons
that
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
filed
separate
opinions
in
both
of
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined,
concurring
in
the
judgment.
