john
paul
stevens
mr.
chandler,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
often
this
material
actually
fell
into
the
hands
of
patients
or
visitors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chandler
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
where
do
you
recommend
the
solicitation
should
take
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
are
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
outside
the
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
front
steps?
under
the
same
danger
on
the
front
steps
that
may
be
a
leaflet
would
be
handed
to
a
patient
not
knowing
he
is
a
patient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
it
could
direct
its
employees
not
the
solicit
of
the
front
because
it
might
have
the
same
adverse
effect,
couldn't
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
control
over
its
employees,
doesn't
it?
why
did
not
it
imply
the
same
rule,
say,
that
you
get
fired
because
this
may
jeopardize
the
health
of
the
psychiatric
patient
walking
in
the
front
door.
isn't
it
precisely
the
same
risk
as
in
the
coffee
shop
where
1%
of
the
people
are
patients
as
i
understand
or
2%
ro
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
in
the
coffee
shop,
of
course,
they
can
at
least
ask
the
person
whether
a
patient
or
not
but
i
suppose
it
is
out
in
front
of
me
little
more
difficult.
people
who
are
walking
along,
you
sort
of
stick
a
leaflet
in
front
of
them.
we
just
figured
that
risk
is
outweighed
by
the
need
to
organize
in
that
particular
context,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
every
patient
i
suppose
has
to
walk
in
the
front
door,
but
everyone
does
not
eat
in
the
cafeteria.
most
patients
i
assume
get
most
of
their
meals
in
their
rooms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chandler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
medical
judgment
point,
can
we
tell
from
the
record
whether
the
rule
was
drafted
by
doctors
and
people
concerned
with
medical
problems
as
opposed
to
the
possibility
that
might
simply
been
drafted
by
the
labor
relations
director?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
the
record
just
does
not
tell
us,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
