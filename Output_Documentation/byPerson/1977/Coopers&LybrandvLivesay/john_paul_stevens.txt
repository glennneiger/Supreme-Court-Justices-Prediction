they
join
all
the
other
members
the
underwriting
sequence
and
we
could
accept
this
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
none?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
the
theory
of
proceeding
against
the
underwriters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
bigger
percentage
that
you
are
offering
that
the
underwriter
with
respect
to
which
the
conflict
existed
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
of
these
cases
involve
the
question
whether
an
appeal
maybe
taken
from
a
trial
court
order
which
denies
the
plaintiff
the
right
to
litigate
on
behalf
a
class
of
similarly
situated
persons.
the
question
in
each
case
is
the
appealability
of
an
order
denying
class
certification.
in
the
gardner
case
the
plaintiff
had
been
denied
a
position
as
a
radio
performer
and
sought
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
--
she
claimed,
she
had
been
denied
this
position
because
of
her
sex
and
she
sought
to
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
all
women
who
had
been
discriminated
against
by
the
defendant
in
either
applying
for
positions
with
the
company
or
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
and
the
trial
judge
denied
her
the
right
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
alleged
class.
she
sought
to
appeal
on
the
ground
that,
the
denial
was
in
effect
the
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
because
the
relief
she
could
get
as
an
individual
was
less
broad
than
the
relief
which
might
be
obtained
on
behalf
of
a
class.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
held
that
the
order
could
not
be
appealed
on
that
theory
pursuant
to
section
1291
a1
of
the
judicial
code.
in
the
other
case,
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
purchasers
of
security
at
a
public
offering.
they
sought
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
all
other
purchasers
at
the
same
public
offering
and
although
the
trial
court
originally
allowed
them,
the
right
to
do
so,
it
redetermined
the
matter
and
held
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
class.
they
claim
that
they
there
being
but
the
offering
violated
the
securities
acts
because
of
certain
alleged
misrepresentations
in
the
prospectus.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
eight
circuit
and
the
theory
that
--
in
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
sufficient
monitory
interest
in
the
matter,
two
plaintiffs,
a
husband
and
wife
and
their
own
right
to
go
forward
with
the
action
and
therefore
denying
them
class
status,
denying
them
the
right
to
represent
the
class
in
effect
killed
off
the
entire
actions,
the
death
knell
of
the
action
was
the
equivalent
therefore
of
a
final
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eight
circuit
after
reviewing
the
finances
of
litigants
and
the
issue
and
the
complexity
of
litigation
concluded
that
it
was
indeed
the
death
knell
and
that
the
appeal
therefore
could
be
taken.
in
both
cases
we
hold
that
the
rules
for
appealability
of
class
action
determinations
are
not
different
from
other
rules
governing
appealability
in
the
federal
courts
and
that
there
are
no
special
rules
designed
for
this
kind
of
litigation,
yet
that
if
congress
wants
to
make
these
orders
appealable
that
certainly
has
the
right
to
do
so,
but
under
the
rules
that
have
been
fashioned
up
to
now.
an
appeal
does
not
lie.
and
so
in
both
cases
the
unanimous
holding
of
the
court
is
that
the
orders
may
not
be
appealed.
that
means
that
in
the
gardner
case
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed
and
in
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
is
reversed.
and
opinions
to
that
effect
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk.
