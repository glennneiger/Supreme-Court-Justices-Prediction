mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
already
gone
through
four
and
a
half
years
of
this
litigation.
this
is
a
relatively
simple
case
for
class
treatment.
it
was
brought
on
behalf
of
approximately
1800
direct
purchases
of
securities
pursuant
to
our
prospectus.
approximately
a
year
after
the
prospectus
was
issued,
i
wanted
to
go
and
wrote
down
the
earnings
reported
in
the
prospectus.
by
decreasing
one
year’s
earnings
to
one
third
of
what
was
recorded
and
another
year’s
earnings
to
60%
of
what
was
recorded.
in
spite
of
those
facts
most
of
the
time
that
has
been
spent
in
this
litigation
has
been
exhaustively
spent
on
the
class
question.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
see
the
background
so
that
we
can
determine
whether
it
was
the
death
knell
in
the
context
of
this
case.
during
three
of
the
years
that
district
court
stayed
discovery
on
the
merits.
there
is
presently
a
stay
entered
on
the
district
court’s
own
motion
of
all
proceedings
and
ordered
decertifying
the
action
as
a
class
action
was
entered
three
years
after
the
action
was
instituted.
the
basis
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
not
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
the
court
had
already
certified
the
class
after
that
purported
delay
exists
occurred.
we
came
into
the
case
long
after
that
transpired,
we
were
the
second
counsel
in
the
case.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
it
did
not
your
honor,
not
in
my
view
because
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
nine
months
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
before
the
motion
was
made
for
the
certification
of
the
class
did
not
delay
the
action.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
first
nine
months
to
be
taken
up
with
pleadings
of
issue,
service
of
interlocutorier,
first
request
for
production
of
documents
in
response
to
that
the
delay
as
the
eighth
circuit
pointed
out
was
provoked
almost
entirely
by
the
actions
of
the
district
court
judge
and
the
defendants
in
the
defense
of
tactics.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
not
really
your
honor
because
we
hope
that
the
class
issue
will
be
early
determined
and
the
rule
in
fact
requires
that
to
be
determined
as
soon
as
practical,
if
a
litigant
starts
an
action
such
as
this,
he
has
to
assume
that
the
court
is
going
to
adhere
to
the
rule
and
indeed
i
think
in
eisen
there
was
some
urging
that
that
be
done
quickly.
so
we
have
to
assume
that
these
things
are
going
to
occur
quickly,
but
the
out
of
pocket
expenses
incurred
during
that
part
of
the
case
are
certainly
a
lot
less
than
were
actually
incurred
after
one
and
half
years
of
litigation
and
that
changes
the
circumstances
in
this
case.
we
try
to
fashion
a
standard
for
a
death
knell
as
i
proceed
in
my
argument
that
i
think
make
some
sense
and
might
be
applicable
on
a
standard
basis
throughout
the
court’s
one
of
problems
i
have
with
the
death
knell
doctrine
as
that
is
very
difficult
to
decide
what
exactly
it
is.
some
court
say
$70
is
what
requires
and
others
say
$7,500
is
that
not
the
death
knell
and
we
would
have
to
find
out
really
what
the
standard
should
be
if
it
is
going
forward
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
no
i
will
demonstrate
i
hope
that
on
this
record
in
this
case
we
have
enough
to
apply
the
standard
that
i
will
suggest.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
and
some
agreed
at
that
as
part
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
yes
some
cases
merged
that
two
concepts
and
others
separate
that.
i
think
they
fall
into
both
and
i
think
it
is
final
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
it
also
fits
well
within
the
collateral
order
doctrine
and
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
in
this
particular
case
the
that
gillespie
doctrine
is
sufficient
support
to
sustain
the
eighth
circuit’s
findings
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
accepted
by
this
court
as
a
viable
doctrine.
what
happened
was
that
the
district
court
decertified
the
class
using
a
standard
that
is
not
mentioned
in
rule
23,
he
decertified
on
the
grounds
that
the
actions
of
plaintiff’s
counsel
had
caused
a
delay
in
the
litigation
thereby
taking
away
rights
from
the
defendants
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
record
indicates
that
the
only
delay
that
was
involved
in
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case
was
approximately
three
months
where
there
was
a
dispute
between
counsel
over
the
production
of
transfer
records.
we
have
relied
upon
a
letter
received
from
punta
gorda’s
counsel
in
august
1975,
promising
to
deliver
the
transfer
records
at
our
request
after
judge
has
fashioned
an
order
which
took
something
like
four
months
for
us
to
that
after
we
submitted
suggested
forms.
we
call
the
counsel
for
punta
gorda
and
they
refused
to
produce
these
documents.
the
record
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
class
certification
also
indicated
that
those
records
were
readily
available
to
counsel
for
punta
gorda.
we
argued
with
them
telephonically
about
this
issue
and
then
we
sought
the
assistance
of
the
court
by
asking
for
a
conference
on
this
issue
when
we
got
to
that
conference,
we
were
met
with
a
motion
by
defendant
coopers
&
lybrand
that
decertified
the
class
with
failure
to
prosecute.
three
years
after
the
litigation
was
commenced
then
after
an
enormous
amount
of
work
was
performed
by
both
sides.
it
was
a
shocking
type
of
a
motion
to
me
and
frankly
that
gave
a
little
credence
at
the
time,
i
guess
i
should
have
treated
it
with
more
seriousness
because
the
judge
granted.
we
did
put
in
papers
in
response
we
also
had
motion’s
request
for
production
then
pending.
there
was
a
stay
on
discovery
at
the
time.
so
there
we
were
with
the
respondent
with
clients
whose
losses
were
approximately
$2,650.
they
had
already
been
required
to
incur
substantial
out
of
pocket
courses
and
they
had
not
as
yet
taken
their
first
deposition
of
a
defendant
in
the
case
nor
were
they
able
to
receive
the
first
document
in
a
discovery
from
defending
coopers
&
lybrand.
the
economic
reality
caused
by
the
decertification
order
was
that
to
continue
the
litigation
with
the
major
portion
of
the
case
on
the
merits
still
ahead
of
us
would
require
an
expenditure
of
respondent’s
plot
of
funds
far
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
their
clients.
that
is
clear
from
the
record
that
even
if
respondents
succeeded
in
winning
their
case
on
the
merits
at
the
trial
the
recovery
could
not
reimburse
the
for
the
out
of
pocket
requirements
to
complete
the
litigation
on
the
merits.
now,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
death
knell
as
i
stated
before
is
what
standard
to
apply
in
these
situations
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
standard
should
be
this
if
a
plaintiff
in
this
kind
of
a
case
having
one
on
the
merits
on
an
individual
claim
could
not
recoup
the
out
of
pocket
expenses
incurred
by
him
during
the
prosecution
of
the
action.
it
makes
no
economic
sense
for
him
to
proceed
and
we
are
not
talking
about
legal
fees,
legal
fees
as
what
he
is
concerned
where
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
he
has
to
attract
an
attorney
to
take
his
case
to
proceed
to
stop
the
case,
stop
the
litigation.
well
now,
three
years
into
litigation
in
this
case,
chief
livesay
and
his
wife
have
already
incurred
certain
expenses.
they
looked
down
the
road
and
they
say
we
have
two
thirds
of
the
case
yet
to
go
on
the
merits.
it
is
going
to
cost
$15,000
to
litigate
it,
we
do
not
have
a
class.
the
only
reason
we
started
this
action
as
because
we
thought
we
would
have
a
class
so
that
if
we
won
on
the
merits
we
would
be
reimbursed
for
the
expenses
that
we
laid
out
on
behalf
of
the
class.
it
makes
no
economic
sense
to
bring
the
$2,650
action
where
if
you
personally
get
a
judgment
at
the
end
for
that
amount
with
the
taxable
cause
she
cannot
recover
the
$15,000.
it
only
makes
sense
if
you
can
be
a
class
representative
and
be
assured
that
after
recovery
on
the
merits
you
will
be
reimbursed
for
those
expenses.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
but
typically
your
honor
when
a
recovery
is
made
on
a
class
basis
all
of
the
out
of
pocket
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
the
action
or
reimbursed
to
the
party
of
the
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
out
of
the
funds
recovery.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
correct.
out
of
funds
recovery.
so
here
chief
livesay
is
confronted
with
a
situation
where
it
would
be
impossible
if
he
continued
this
action
and
tried
his
case
on
the
merits
and
won
for
him
to
recover
to
recoup
these
expenses
as
that
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
your
honor
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
good
approach
at
something
that
the
ninth
circuit
looks
at.
i
think
it
makes
amass
of
the
proceedings
at
the
early
stage
of
the
case
when
the
class
was
decided.
it
requires
evidentiary
hearings.
it
requires
the
necessity
for
interventions
which
american
type
and
rule
23
seek
to
avoid
was
seeking
to
avoid
multiplicity
of
litigation.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
how
would
we
go
about
doing
that
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
your
honor
i
am
an
attorney
who
has
to
comply
with
my
ethical
responsibilities
i
can
go
out
and
solicit
client
if
the
client
does
not
knock
on
my
door
i
have
no
client
that
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
as
an
attorney
in
those
circumstances
to
go
out
and
solicit
and
drum
up
with
patient.
at
least
that
is
the
way
i
proceed
at
the
time
and
there
is
no
record
that
anybody
else
came
to
me.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
and
there
is
nobody
intervened.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
i
suppose
not
but
he
thought
he
was
an
adequate
class
representatives.
i
think
he
is
proving
that
he
is.
he
is
diligently
stood
behind
this
throughout
this
hectic
litigation
for
four
and
half
years,
indeed
i
spoke
to
him
last
night
and
why
should
he
have
to
go
out
and
seek
somebody
else.
he
has
rights
personally
under
rule
23.
his
right
is
to
bring
a
class
action
and
if
he
feels
that
he
is
an
adequate
class
representative
and
that
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
decertifying
class
with
him
as
the
class
standard
there.
why
should
he
have
to
go
out
and
search
for
somebody
else.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
exactly,
but
in
a
death
knell
situation,
he
has
not
got
the
means
to
go
forward
to
the
end
of
the
case
so
we
can
remedy
that
long
after
the
trial.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
i
understand
that
but
rule
23
gives
him
a
right.
this
is
a
collateral
right
and
it
is
a
right
recognized
by
the
(inaudible)
rule
23
is
necessary
for
him
to
have
his
cause
heard
in
court
without
that
right
he
cannot
be
in
court.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
it
did
not
give
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
i
agree
that
it
did
not
give
any
substantive
right
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
now,
let
us
--
i
do
not
say
it
gives
some
substantive
rights,
i
say
it
gives
some
procedural
rights.
the
procedural
right
is
that
he
can
have
this
in
court
by
representing
a
class
without
that
procedural
right
he
has
not
that
in
court,
indeed
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
he
has
complained.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
he
would
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
i
think
he
is
complained
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
we
are
complaining
that
district
court
wrongfully
strip
them
off
the
ability
to
go
forward
as
a
class
representative
so
that
if
he
wins
the
case
on
the
merits
he
can
get
back
his
incurred
expenses.
that
is
what
we
are
complaining
about.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
there
are
some
cases
that
say
you
cannot
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
why
do
not,
suppose
four
people
decide
to
sue
a
company.
they
all
have
what
they
think
are
similar
problems
and
they
agree
to
share
expenses
and
they
are
all
named
plaintiffs.
early
in
the
litigation;
however,
it
turns
out
that
the
judge
thinks
three
of
them
are
not
in
the
same
position
and
dismisses
their
case,
dismisses
the
amount
of
a
case.
the
remaining
plaintiff
just
does
not
feel
that
he
can
get
very
far
by
himself.
he
has
got
the
money
now,
he
is
not
in
a
very
much
different
position
then
your
client.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
that
is
not
appealable.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
i
would
think
your
honor
that
in
that
situation
54
(b)
might
be
appropriate
and
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
correct
and
i
agree
that
when
you
have
a
judge
who
does
not
appear
to
be
cooperative,
you
have
a
special
kind
of
a
problem
that
is
the
moment
when
you
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
your
honor
if
i
were
in
that
situation
as
you
portrayed
i
think
i
might
attempt
to
go
up
under
the
doctrine
that
was
adopted
in
the
in
form
of
court’s
response
to
the
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
i
would
argue
that
it
is
a
final
decision
in
those
peculiar
circumstances.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
i
just
am
not
familiar
with
that.
well,
there
is
not
really
much
difference
between
that
plaintiff.
i
just
correct
than
your
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
the
difference
is
that
we
have
rule
23
which
if
i
can
quote
a
statute
for
the
moment
gives
certain
rights
and
those
rights
are
rights
that
chief
livesay
and
his
wife
has.
there
are
no
similar
rights
in
your
example.
there
are
such
similar
rights
i
think
in
forma
pauperis
situation.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
those
are
substantive
right
your
honor
and
i
am
making
that
distinction
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
they
do
not
have
rule
23
rights
and
the
frames
of
rule
23
suggested
that
this
is
an
important
right
that
they
wanted
to
give
to
small
claims
obvious.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
i
am
saying
that
rule
23
has
to
be
read
together
with
and
that
since
there
is
a
right
under
rule
23
to
bring
this
action
as
a
small
claim
served
because
of
a
recognition
that
without
rule
23
you
could
not
bring
it.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
not
a
section
11
case,
i
am
sorry
yes
you
came
with
another
10
(b)(5)
yes.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
and
10
(b)(5)
if
there
is
an
account
for
10
(b)(5)
here
also.
section
11
is
mutual
but
10
(b)(5)
is
not.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
your
honor
i
do
not
know
if
the
defendants
would
like
very
much
having
a
procedure
whereby
a
notice
would
be
sent
out
to
a
track
of
the
people.
i
think
i
might
enjoy
it
immensely
and
who
would
pay
for
it
is
another
question.
i
would
take
that
as
an
alternative
to
some
of
these
problems
if
we
can
send
that
a
notice
to
attract
the
additional
people
into
the
case.
i
do
not
think
the
defendants
would
(inaudible)
for.
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
we
did
not
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
first
of
all
i
had
been
fourth
circuit’s
that
had
adopted
the
death
knell
doctrine
at
that
point.
we
thought
therefore
we
had
an
absolute
right
to
appeal,
so
we
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
we
do
not
think
a
discretionary
right
is
equal
to
an
absolute
right.
secondly,
we
felt
we
had
a
mandamus
situation
and
we
filed
the
petition
for
mandamus
in
the
circuit
court.
we
thought
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
go
to
a
district
court
judge
from
whose
decisions
we
were
seeking
mandamus
for
abusive
discretion
asking
him
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
our
favor.
i
think
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
that
is
a
good
reason.
thirdly
in
the
hearings
on
the
class
motion
the
district
court
judge
himself
stated
that
he
wanted
to
make
a
record
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
a
right
to
go
up
under
death
knell,
so
we
have
read
that
to
mean
that
he
himself
accepted
the
death
knell
doctrine
as
a
viable
way
to
appeal
this
case
whenever
you
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
your
honor
there
is
some
doubt
on
that
question
because
the
court’s
differ
on
what
type
of
order
can
be
appealed
under
1292
(b)
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
one
(voice
overlap)
that
had
already
been
terminated
and
two
what
is
a
controlling
question
of
law.
now,
i
think
in
this
case
we
had
it
except
that
it
had
already
terminated
by
the
controlling
question
of
warrant
issue.
i
think
we
had
it
because
we
felt
that
the
judge
decertified
the
class
on
criteria
outside
of
rule
23
which
was
a
peculiar
circumstance
and
we
thought
that
this
was
a
broader
question
not
just
the
question
as
that
arose
in
the
litigation.
we
did
not
proceed
in
that
fashion
for
the
reasons
i
stated
before.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
right
and
of
course
rule
54
(b)
is
also
a
discretionary
rule
and
we
have
the
same
reasons
for
not
seeking
discretionary
rule
54
(b)
treatment.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
the
54
(b)
type
situation.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
that
is
correct.
that
is
inconsistent
with
our
belief
that
death
knell
doctrine
gave
us
an
absolute
right
to
appeal.
now,
we
did
file
the
mandamus
and
it
was
declared
moot
by
the
eighth
circuit
because
they
gave
us
our
relief
under
1291
and
we
believe
that
the
grant
of
mandamus
can
be
read
into
their
decision
in
this
case.
the
rule
that
the
district
court
did
abuse
its
discretion
and
they
reversed
them.
now,
we
refute
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
if
this
court
does
not
accept
the
death
knell
as
meeting
the
requirements
of
section
1291
where
the
collateral
order
doctrine
exception
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
remain
this
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
for
a
determination
of
respondents’
mandamus
petition.
nine
more
federal
practice
paragraph
110,
128
of
pages
315
and
316
are
recognized
us
that
while
the
procedure
is
set
forth
in
the
rule
for
mandamus
as
rule
21
of
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
should
be
followed
the
courts
of
appeal
cannot
frequently
do
to
treat
a
notice
of
appeal
as
a
petition
for
mandamus,
if
the
order
sought
to
be
reviewed
is
not
applicable,
but
the
question
presented
is
subject
to
review
by
mandamus.
so
the
court
had
the
power
to
treat
the
1291
appeal
even
if
it
found
that
it
was
not
an
appropriate
appeal
remedy
as
a
mandamus
petition
and
as
such
this
case
is
we
are
now
reviewing
that
decision
and
we
say
that
the
eighth
circuit
can
again
take
the
mandamus
petition
then.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
your
honor
that
brings
me
to
gillespie
and
gillespie
--
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
no,
i
do
not
say
that
there
should
be
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
every
order
but
in
a
situation
when
there
is
conduct
at
the
district
court
level
that
is
appropriate
for
mandamus
i
think
that
the
right
of
the
party
is
clear.
he
should
be
able
to
go
up
on
the
mandamus
petition.
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
decided
as
moot
because
it
had
decided
in
our
favor
under
1291.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
oh,
i
agree
your
honor
that
it
is
a
totally
inadequate
remedy
for
a
person
in
the
death
knell
situation.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
and
impossible
i
agree
with
that
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
say
we
have
finality
here.
mandamus
is
not
adequate,
1292
(b)
is
discretionary
and
we
say
that
that
is
not
adequate
so
we
are
left
with
1291,
but
in
this
particular,
that
is
a
general
proposition.
in
this
particular
case
we
feel
that
mandamus
was
appropriate
and
before
my
time
runs
out
i
would
like
to
get
into
gillespie
because
this
ties
my
whole
argument
up.
the
gillespie
doctrine
is
one
which
will
avoid
the
requirement
of
further
findings
and
rulings
at
the
appellate
level
on
the
questions
raised
in
this
case.
the
order
being
reviewed
here
was
at
least
of
marginal
finality.
why
was
it
of
marginal
finality
that
district
court
had
stated
that
he
felt
that
death
knell
doctrine
was
appropriate.
the
district
court
had
made
a
death
knell
record
for
other
circuits
at
that
point
in
time
had
adopted
the
death
knell
doctrine.
the
eisen
fourth
decision
appeared
to
support
the
theory
so
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
the
eighth
circuit
to
accept
the
death
knell
doctrine.
having
now
spent
all
the
time
and
effort
in
deciding
the
issues
which
it
did,
it
was
a
painstaking
decision
went
into
every
detail
of
the
lower
court’s
conduct.
it
made
findings
and
had
reversed.
under
these
circumstances
where
the
order
is
fundamental
to
the
further
conduct
of
the
case
and
we
say
it
is
and
the
circuit
court
in
good
faith
accepted
the
appeal
and
spent
the
time
in
deciding
the
issue.
gillespie
holds
that
this
court
can
without
further
redo
accept
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
i
have
clients
here
your
honor
and
they
are
my
first
concern
although
i
specialize
in
class
action
of
litigation.
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
doctrine
itself
is
less
important
to
me
than
these
people.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
well,
your
honor
it
is
possible
that
your
honor’s
down
accepted
at
the
death
knell
doctrine
and
so
state
but
at
the
same
time
sustained
my
position
in
this
case
or
in
affect
affirm
the
eighth
circuit’s
decision.
i
think
what
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
is
that
mr.
justice
marshall
this
morning
made
a
point
what
would
happen
in
these
death
knell
situation
so
that
what
is
the
appellate
courts,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
i
do
not
think
it
will.
well
these
--
i
have
been
in
practice
and
i
have
rather
watched
from
specializing
in
this
field
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
sought
a
death
knell
type
of
an
appeal.
we
do
not
normally
seek
it.
we
think
that
the
final
decision
rule
is
a
sound
one
and
we
try
to
prevent
clocking
the
courts.
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
from
time
to
time
we
think
this
case
is
one
of
them.
mr.
melvyn
i.
weiss
but
your
honor,
you
know
the
defendants
--
there
is
a
great
risk
to
a
plaintiff
in
that
situation
because
the
circuit
court
can
indeed
rule
for
the
defendants
and
put
an
end
to
the
litigation
and
not
only
put
an
end
to
this
litigation
but
put
an
end
to
any
other
case
that
might
seek
some
other
relief
as
a
class
where
there
is
a
“better
representative
of
the
class.”
thank
you
your
honors.
