unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
considerations
of
the
same
with
respect
to
denial
of
class
certification
as
they
are
when
there
has
been
a
certification
and
then
a
decertification?
unknown
speaker
none
of
the
cases
upholding
the
death
knell
doctrine,
i
have
distinguished
between
the
two
and
i
have
some
other
dealt
with
decertification?
unknown
speaker
just
one
for
example.
unknown
speaker
well,
until
decertification
now,
the
lawsuit
was
going
forward
not
only
on
behalf
of
the
name,
plaintiff
went
on
behalf
of
others?
unknown
speaker
and
that
decertifications
terminated
that
case
on
behalf
of
others
--
unknown
speaker
no
question
about
that
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
terminated
to
determine
whatever
this
case
had
to
do
with
others
has
been
terminated.
it
was
going
forward
on
behalf
of
others
although
one
name?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
not
go
forward
nevertheless
it
has
been
dismissed
with
respect
to
others?
unknown
speaker
it
is
waived
that
it
would
not
have
been
had
the
trial
judge
simply
initially
refused
to
certify
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
except
before
the
trial
judge
initially
refuses
to
certify,
there
never
has
been
going
ahead
with
respect
of
class
members?
unknown
speaker
but
if
notice
(inaudible).
you
would
not
think
to
make
any
difference
would
you?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
finality
it
would
be
there
with
same
result
even
no
notice
had
gone
up?
unknown
speaker
what
if
your
class
members
had
noticed
that
you
are
perfectly
happy
in
that
effect
you
to
light
in
the
case
as
going
forward
on
behalf
of
the
class
which
includes
you
and
they
you
are
notified
that
the
case
is
no
longer
going
forward
on
your
behalf
and
has
been
dismissed
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
spend
your
own
money
i
guess
if
you
want
to
litigate.
i
take
that
you
would
say
that
you
could
not
intervene
either
an
appeal
the
denial
of
the
decertification?
unknown
speaker
why
could
that
person
intervene
and
appeal?
unknown
speaker
so
i
know
but
the
reason
you
are
suggesting
that
he
could
appeal
because
it
has
been
a
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
asked
you?
the
mcdonald
did
not
say
to
hold
that,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
it
did
not
hold
that
the
intervener
could
not
intervene
earlier?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
could
he
not
appeal
and
say
there
has
been
the
final
judgment
here
the
case
that
was
going
forward
on
my
behalf
has
been
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
this
case
has
been
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
noticed
that
he
got
notice
telling
in
that
was
his
case?
unknown
speaker
if
he
was
notified
that
he
was
notified
to
as
a
class
member?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
were
not
really
dismissed
either?
unknown
speaker
rule
54
at
least
requires
that
there
would
be
finding
by
the
court
in
such
a
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
had
not
made
the
circuits
have
the
death
knell
doctrine,
second
and
now
the
eighth
--
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
fifth
in
amount
of
54?
unknown
speaker
as
it
increased
in
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
it
is
an
order
denying
summary
judgment
--
unknown
speaker
without
any
respect
to
class
action?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
circuits
that
allow
appeal
of
orders
granting
class
certification?
unknown
speaker
but
the
activities
you
describe
counsel
has
typically
taken
the
first
nine
months’
discovery
interlocutorier
as
they
are
themselves
quite
expensive
and
time
consuming,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
do
that
without
any
knowledge
that
you
will
succeed
and
have
you
class
certified?
unknown
speaker
so
does
that
not
take
something
within
your
death
knell
claim?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that
is
conceptionally.
there
is
difference
of
opinion
about
the
death
knell
doctrine
too
as
there
is
some
one
view
of
being
that
it
is
a
final
judgment
as
a
practical
matter
and
the
other
view
being
that
it
is
not
a
final
judgment
but
nonetheless
it
is
appealable
because
the
peculiar
equities
of
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
taxable
cause
would
be
a
great
deal
more
if
there
were
class
certification
than
if
there
were
not?
unknown
speaker
out
of
the
fund
recovery?
unknown
speaker
not
from
the
defendants’
separate
and
apart
from
their
liability?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weiss
to
what
extent
was
that
possible
intervention
of
people
with
more
a
stake
relevant.
there
is
something
in
record
about
how
the
clients
might
have
been
in
absolute
recovery
to?
how
do
you
fit
it
out
that
in
the
whole
test
in
your
analysis
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
district
judge
thought
i
do
not
whether
it
is
greater
now
but
they
had
thought
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
particular
class
representative
cannot
the
defect
if
that
one
sometimes
be
cured
by
getting
a
new
party
in
with
little
more
financial
resources
that
may
be
not
have
the
deficiency
with
first
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
testimony
that
the
regional
counsel
represented
lot
of
people
who
had
bought
some
of
the
stock
and
they
knew
about
the
action,
might
have
got
the
notice
before
the
decertification
and
would
have
in
interest
in
the
assurance
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
any
plaintiff
or
any
defendant
who
feels
that
district
court
has
made
an
erroneous
ruling
against
him.
he
has
a
right
which
may
have
been
infringed?
unknown
speaker
frequently
in
many
non
class
action
situations
he
will
not
have
that
means
to
go
ahead
and
remedy
it?
unknown
speaker
why
if
they
had
lost
on
the
merits
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
unless
judge
make
some
addition
finding
that
there
is
no
reason
for
delay
they
just
tell
us
that
even
if
no
one
who
has
been
dismissed,
cannot
appeal?
unknown
speaker
why?
but
not
unless
the
judge
is
cooperating?
unknown
speaker
well,
yet
that
it
is
not
appealable
under
the
rules
unless
the
judge
makes
whatever
he
supposed
to
do
and
it
is
not
appealable
just
because
the
remaining
plaintiff
may
decide
i
cannot
go
forward?
unknown
speaker
but
that
may
be
so
i
am
asking
to
know
is
that
a
final
subject
to
appeal
with
--?
unknown
speaker
what
(inaudible)
was
i
not
heard?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
there
is
because
here
you
say
--
well,
if
you
see
the
four
people
certainly
had
the
right
under
the
procedural
right
under
the
rules
to
sue
jointly.
unknown
speaker
these
people
are
a
fortiori,
have
rights
that
they
are
named
plaintiffs.
they
have
the
right
to
institute
a
litigation?
unknown
speaker
they
have
procedural
rights
to
have
been
in
court?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
suggests
that
rule
23
is
to
be
elevated
against
above
all
other
procedural
and
substantive
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
bring
to
state
court?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
section
11
case?
unknown
speaker
what
about
attempts
to
have
the
parties
to
a
case?
and
then
the
say
of
third
party
claim
that
gets
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weiss,
you
did
not
seek
a
1292?
unknown
speaker
to
engage
it?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
a
reason?
did
you
have
a
reason
not
--
although
that
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
any
doubt
if
you
have
wanted
to
go
the
interlocutory
appeal
the
1292
(b)
covered
an
appeal
from
a
decertification
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
requirement
that
may
materially
advance
the
although
a
termination
of
litigation?
unknown
speaker
independently
if
any
reservations
however
you
could?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
do
not
get
the
favorable
exercise
of
discretion
rule
54(b)
the
order
has
simply
not
appealable?
it
is
not
final?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
even
with
a
--?
unknown
speaker
but
what
mr.
walsh,
what
is
your
response
to
counsel’s
point
that
it
would
have
been
unethical
for
him
to
call
up
those
people
and
say
would
you
like
me
to
represent
you?
unknown
speaker
such
an
order
will
step
you
out?
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
not
go
out?
unknown
speaker
so
that
how
was
that
respond
was
concerned?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walsh
about
how
long
would
we
have
(inaudible)
there?
if
we
paid
$15,000
to
collect
$2,600?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walsh,
i
think
you
said
in
the
original
argument
that
you
filed
with
a
1292
(b)
appeal
was
available
here
and
i
can
say
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
some
problems
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
application
with
an
attempt
within
the
tax
that
we
have
required
what
is
in
the
1292
(b)
itself
would
not
you
have
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
mandamus
if
you
would
prevail
on
primarily?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
what
would
a
case
have
said
and
are
there
any
cases
as
to
any
mandamus?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walsh
suppose
as
what
to
trial
on
the
merits
and
they
will
get
awarded
for
the
$2,650?
unknown
speaker
how
he
can
only
get
an
appeal
under
decertification
order
in
that
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
he
is
at
loss
at
which
he
wins?
unknown
speaker
it
was
$2,650?
unknown
speaker
the
named
plaintiff
appealed
there
in
some
intervener?
unknown
speaker
mcdonald
that
with
a
intervener?
unknown
speaker
the
named
plaintiff
had
won
by
settlement
--?
unknown
speaker
by
what
was
the
named
plaintiff
i
am
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
what
was
his
concern
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
up
to
the
time
that
she
want?
unknown
speaker
mr.
walsh
as
i
understood
my
brother
brennan’s
earlier
question
to
you
about
1292
(b),
it
was
whether
a
refusal
to
certify
a
class
action
or
an
order
as
in
this
case
decertifying
a
class
could
ever
fall
within
the
definitive
language
of
1292(b)
which
requires
a
controlling
question
of
law
and
that
an
appeal
may
materially
advance
the
element
termination
of
the
litigation
and
i
think
that
was
this
question
and
anywhere
it
is
mine?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
arguable
that
no
such
order
could
ever
fall
even
be
eligible
for
discretionary
consideration
under
1292
(b)?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
your
position
you
can
see
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
generically
it
could
be
available?
unknown
speaker
has
there
any
circuit
faced
that
question?
unknown
speaker
you
probably
faced
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
but
do
not
bother
if
it
is
not
in
the
brief.
