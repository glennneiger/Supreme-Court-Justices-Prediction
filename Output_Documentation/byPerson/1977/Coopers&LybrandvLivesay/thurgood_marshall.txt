justice
thurgood
marshall
in
some
court
other
than
a
federal
court,
they
need
below
$10,000
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
no
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
specific
case,
the
another
member
who
declared
to
file
during
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
could
he
maintain
to
that
at
this
stage
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
estoppel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
law
of
the
case
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
case
was
just
left
there
were
original
denial
of
certification,
were
that
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
that
happens
in
66?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
how
do
you
take
statements
and
what
you
are
having?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
already
you
had
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
upon
that
delay,
would
it
a
failure
to
move
on
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
correct.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
that
help
the
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
change
in
counsel
does
not
delay
a
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
far
more
because
of
no
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
the
reason
of
class
action
theory.
the
original
class
action
theory
was
that
this
was
not
a
right.
it
was
a
procedure
by
which
where
the
class
was
too
numerous
to
name
they
could
be
brought
in,
but
it
did
not
give
any
rights
to
their
regional
plaintiff
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
that
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
not
complained
about
representing
the
class.
he
has
complained
that
because
he
can
pay
this
bill
amount?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
never
has
complained
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
right
now,
as
nobody
has
complained
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
not
what
are
you
complaining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know
how
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
case
if
they
were
lost
lack
of
money
to
prosecute
that
why
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
we
give
mandamus
for
every
interlocutory
order
of
every
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
any
non
final
judgment
and
the
appeal
about
mandamus
you
do
not
want
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
impossible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
promise
us
that
if
grant
in
your
favor
in
the
future
you
would
not
bring
it
again?(laughter)
unless
you
are
going
that
far
i
am
unimpressed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
would
it
be
if
we
consistently
spent
$15,000
to
get
$2,600?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
he
would
not
be
that
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
court
and
what
relief
does
he
get
if
he
wins
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir
what
relief
does
he
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
allover
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
could
look?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
if
you
would
appeal
class
action
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
because
say
yes,
you
can
have
a
class
action
and
you
go
back
in
a
trial
case
allover
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
could
it
--
what
would
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
the
real
old
case
called
andre
(ph)
v.
lee
which
says
you
just
cannot
do
that?
