justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
theory
of
the
death
knell
is
not
that
the
order
declining
to
certify
is
not
capable
of
being
changed
by
the
trial
court,
but
that
if
it
is
initially
entered
it
means
the
case
just
would
not
be
further
prosecuted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
might
if
prosecution
continued
later
changes
mind
does
not
undermine
the
basis
for
the
death
knell
doctrine
i
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
in
fifth
circuit
and
would
be
appearing
before
a
district
judge
in
the
fifth
circuit
would
you
think
that
he
was
acting
properly
if
he
reject
an
offer
of
proof
as
to
whether
or
not
the
action
would
go
forward
in
view
of
the
fifth
circuitâ€™s
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
appellate
court
is
not
engaged
in
free
trial?
