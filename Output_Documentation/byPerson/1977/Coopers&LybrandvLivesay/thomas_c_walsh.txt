mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
death
knell
case.
the
court
today
in
this
matter
is
being
asked
to
decide
the
validity
of
the
so
called
death
knell
exception
to
the
vulnerable
final
judgment
rule
of
section
1291
title
28
united
states
code.
the
death
knell
doctrine
was
first
formulated
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
original
eisen
case
in
1966,
simply
stated
it
permits
an
appeal
by
a
class
action
plaintiff
from
an
order
refusing
to
certify
the
case
for
a
class
action
treatment
if
the
plaintiff
can
convince
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
would
abandon
his
individual
claim
if
he
is
not
permitted
to
represent
the
class.
under
those
circumstances
the
court
of
appeals
in
eisen
deemed
the
refusal
to
certify
to
be
a
final
judgment
because
it
sounded
the
so
called
death
knell
of
the
case.
the
purpose
for
the
death
knell
doctrine
as
originally
conceived
and
as
the
word
has
been
applied
is
not
to
create
some
special
right
of
action
or
special
right
of
appeal
in
a
class
action
plaintiff
as
the
respondents
in
this
case
seem
to
indicate,
rather
the
only
purpose
for
the
death
knell
doctrine
was
to
make
sure
that
an
order
refusing
to
certify
the
class
action
would
not
ultimately
go
unreviewed.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
when
the
order
refusing
to
certify
is
issued
does
that
whatever
mean
that
this
matter
will
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
that
purpose
of
the
death
knell
doctrine
in
mind
throughout
our
discussion
in
this
morning.
in
the
intervening
12
years
since
eisen
want
the
death
knell
doctrine
frankly
has
not
faired
well.
its
validity
has
repeatedly
been
questioned
by
the
second
circuit
itself
including
in
particular
of
judge
henry
friendly
who
has
called
for
its
abolishing.
the
doctrine
has
been
rejected
flatly
by
the
third
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit.
it
has
been
applied
and
modified
form
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
very
limited
form
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
are
hear
this
morning
asking
this
court
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
eisen
case,
and
if
the
court
will
to
sound
the
death
knell
for
the
death
knell
doctrine.
it
might
be
appropriate
and
helpful
at
this
point
to
review
in
summary
fashion
the
facts
of
the
instant
case.
this
is
an
action
brought
in
1973
under
the
securities
act
1933
and
the
securities
exchange
act
1934.
the
complaint
charged
that
a
registration
statement
and
a
prospectus
issued
by
the
co-petitioner
punta
gorda
oils,
inc.
contains
certain
false
statements.
although
the
original
complaint
made
class
action
allegations.
the
plaintiffs
themselves
waited
more
than
nine
months
before
they
initially
requested
the
court
to
certify
a
class
and
even
at
that
time
they
did
not
request
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
eventually,
some
18
months
after
the
action
was
originally
filed,
they
finally
requested
a
hearing
after
being
prompted
to
do
so
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
hearing
was
held
promptly
and
within
one
month
after
the
final
brief
was
filed
by
the
parties
on
the
class
action
question,
the
district
court
in
st.
louis
certified
the
case
for
class
action
treatment;
however,
at
the
same
time,
the
district
court
issued
an
order
to
the
attorney
for
the
class
action
plaintiffs
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
enjoined
from
representing
the
class
and
the
background
of
that
was
that
it
came
out
in
the
hearing
on
the
class
action
question
that
those
attorneys
who
were
representing
the
plaintiffs
in
this
purported
to
represent
the
class
had
in
fact
represented
one
of
the
underwriters
who
was
involved
in
the
offering.
it
was
on
unrelated
matters
but
they
had
had
a
continuing
relationship
with
that
underwriter
and
there
are
refusal
to
join
the
underwriters
as
defendants
in
the
lawsuit
caused
some
questions
to
come
up
about
whether
that
judgment
was
a
fair
one
or
whether
it
might
have
been
contended
a
conflict
of
interest.
so
at
the
time
that
the
trial
judge
certified
the
matter
for
a
class
action
treatment
he
also
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
to
the
attorneys
why
they
should
not
be
enjoined.
they
chose
not
to
contest
that
and
they
withdrew
from
the
action
at
which
time
present
counsel
for
the
respondents
appeared.
immediately
upon
the
appearance
of
new
counsel,
the
trial
judge
inquired
other
than
whether
they
intended
to
join
the
underwriters
in
the
lawsuit
and
the
judges’
view
at
that
time
what
we
are
still
not
clear
who
the
parties
to
this
case
were
going
to
be.
he
was
not
given
an
answer
to
that
question
until
late
in
october
1975,
at
which
time
it
became
clear
to
him
that
the
reasoning
underwriters
had
not
been
joined
was
that
the
statute
limitations
had
entirely
run
against
them
while
initial
counsel
for
the
respondents
had
been
struggling
to
keep
the
conflict
of
interest
from
coming
to
the
court’s
attention,
at
that
time
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
against
the
underwriters?
i
believe
so
yes,
sir
and
at
the
outset
under
at
least
a
couple
of
theories
of
the
respondents
in
their
complaint,
the
underwriters
could
properly
have
been
joined
as
defendants.
upon
coming
to
this
realization
in
october
1975,
with
trial
court
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no
your
honor,
none
of
the
underwriters
were
joined.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
none
of
them
of
course.
the
parties
were
punta
gorda
oils,
the
issuer
its
officers
and
directors
and
coopers
&
lybrand
were
coming
for.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
a
standard
procedure
in
securities
cases
your
honor
to
join
the
underwriters
their
liability
is
virtually
automatic
if
you
establish
the
other
elements
of
liability
under
section
11
for
instance
of
the
33
act.
it
is
a
fairly
routine
matter
that
the
trial
court
just
wanted
to
know
why
it
was
not
done
and
never
really
did
get
a
satisfactory
answer
and
was
caused
to
become
concerned
that
there
were
other
reasons
just
in
the
merits
of
the
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
a
small
percentage
your
honor
that
is
all.
in
its
october
23,
1975
order
the
trial
court
expressly
said
that
he
was
concerned
about
the
adequacy
of
the
representation
of
the
class
that
was
being
interpreted
by
these
respondents
and
he
directed
at
that
time
that
a
notice
be
sent
to
the
class
advising
them
of
what
had
happened
today
in
the
lawsuit
and
specifically
requesting
petitions
either
for
intervention
or
for
appointment
of
a
new
class
representative.
it
also
at
that
time
the
court
directed
the
respondents
to
initiate
discovery
as
to
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
class
members
for
the
purpose
of
sending
this
notice.
he
had
stayed
discovery
up
to
point
on
the
merit,
until
the
class
action
question
could
finally
result.
again
however
the
respondents
did
not
comply
with
the
order
and
in
fact
they
waited
more
than
six
months
been
into
and
formally
requested
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
class
members
and
more
than
nine
months
before
they
actually
initiated
the
discovery
procedures
under
the
rules.
at
that
point
in
a
motion
to
decertify
the
class
was
filed
and
on
september
01,
1976
the
court
exacerbated
with
the
behavior
of
the
respondents
and
vitally
concerned
about
both
their
adequacy
of
representation
and
that
the
delays
that
had
occurred
decertified
the
class
and
ordered
that
the
respondents’
individual
claims
could
proceed.
at
that
time,
the
respondents
did
not
ask
for
a
section
1292
(b)
certification
instead
they
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit
under
section
1291
and
in
a
separate
independent
proceeding
they
asked
the
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
the
decertification
order.
the
eighth
circuit
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
after
argument
on
the
merits
held
that
decertification
order
was
appealed
under
death
knell
doctrine
and
then
ruled
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
decertifying
the
case
and
it
ordered
to
recertify
it
without
any
discussion
of
whether
it
should
have
been
in
the
first
place.
in
permitting
the
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
took
note
of
the
fact
that
the
respondents’
individual
claim
was
in
the
amount
of
$2,650
and
that
the
expenses
of
prosecuting
the
action
would
exceed
that
amount
and
therefore
held
that
the
death
knell
doctrine
that
the
death
knell
of
a
case
has
sounded
and
it
denied
a
mandamus
petition
as
moved.
primary
question
presented
to
this
court
on
certiorari
deals
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
the
appeal
from
the
decertification
order.
secondary
question
presented
in
our
petition
is
that
if
jurisdiction
is
found
to
exist
in
the
court
of
appeals,
did
the
eighth
circuit
overstepped
the
permissible
bounce
of
judicial
appellate
review
in
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
district
court.
i
will
confine
my
oral
remarks
primarily
to
the
first
point
which
i
think
is
of
most
interest
to
the
court.
i
think
the
second
point
has
been
adequately
briefed
and
relied
principally
on
our
briefs
in
that
connection.
we
submit
that
the
death
knell
doctrine
has
an
improper
reading
of
section
1291
of
title
28.
section
1291
of
course
embodies
the
final
judgment
rule
which
traces
through
its
back
to
the
first
judiciary
act
of
1789,
it
has
been
described
as
the
dominant
rule
of
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
designed
to
prevent
peace
appeals
and
undue
litigiousness.
in
carroll
v.
united
states
which
perhaps
the
closest
case
on
its
facts
to
the
instant
merit.
the
court
held
that
the
judgment
is
final
only
if
determination
of
the
action
is
the
necessary
result
of
the
order
and
it
also
held
that
appealability
cannot
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
given
case.
well,
the
death
knell
doctrine
in
our
view
violates
these
principles.
the
order
which
decertified
the
class
in
the
present
case
did
not
act
in
anyway
upon
the
claim
of
the
individual
respondents.
they
came
into
court
with
a
claim
for
$2,650
after
the
class
action
was
certified,
they
still
had
a
claim
for
$2,650.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
this
was
under
the
securities
act
your
honor,
so
they
qualify
without
regard
in
the
amount
of
controversies.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
after
the
action
was
decertified
they
still
had
a
claim
for
$2,650.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
that
is
not
clear
either.
the
record
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
of
course
was
not
made
with
a
view
to
our
determining
whether
the
death
knell
would
eventually
sound
and
it
never
is
with
the
few
exceptions,
but
the
record
does
show
in
this
case
that
the
individual
respondent
sees
in
livesay
acknowledged
in
his
deposition
where
he
would
have
asked,
“will
you
continue
to
proceed
with
this
case
if
it
does
not
go
forward
on
a
class
basis?
”he
said,
“well,
i
will
have
to
think
about
that,
but
i
have
to
leave
that
decision
up
to
my
lawyer,
if
my
lawsuit
then
yes
i
will
proceed.”
well,
he
personally
did
not
considered
the
claim
to
be
unviable
and
it
shows
that
the
decision
is
really
that
of
the
lawyer.
it
is
an
economic
decision
by
the
lawyer
rather
than
an
order
which
acts
upon
a
claim.
the
decertification
order
did
not
act
upon
their
claim.
it
created
a
situation
in
which
the
lawyer
had
to
make
the
decision
whether
he
wanted
to
undertake
this
claim
under
these
facts
at
this
time.
furthermore,
the
respondents
in
an
earlier
petition
for
mandamus
to
the
court
of
appeals
had
told
the
court
that
they
intended
to
continue
with
the
claim
even
if
class
action
certification
was
denied.
so
there
they
were
trying
to
get
the
court
that
act
under
representation
that
they
did
intend
to
pursue
the
matter
on
an
individualized
basis
and
in
fact
after
the
decertification
order
was
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals
they
did
continue,
while
they
engaged
in
considerable
discovery
at
a
time
when
the
only
thing
that
was
pending
for
their
individual
claims
and
respondents
sees
in
livesay
in
opposition
to
the
certification
order
filed
an
affidavit
in
which
he
said,
“i
do
intend
i
am
committed
to
this
case
and
i
do
intend
to
follow
it
up.”
we
think
that
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
a
judicially
created
exception
to
the
finality
requirement
which
in
practice
primarily
applies
to
any
trust
and
securities
claims
and
which
ordinarily
does
not
apply
to
such
cases
as
civil
rights
actions
or
adversity
cases.
we
think
it
ignores
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
baltimore
contractors
v.
bodinger
and
liberty
mutual
v.
wetzel
and
which
hold
that
the
amendments
to
the
finality
requirement
of
section
1291
are
really
matters
for
congress
and
in
that
area
section
1292
(b)
has
been
created
as
the
vehicle
for
review
of
interlocutory
orders
and
that
further
judicial
exceptions
to
the
finality
requirement
are
unwarned
and
unwise.
we
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
most
of
which
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
why
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
inadvisable,
improper
and
unwarned.
reason
number
one
has
to
do
with
the
language
of
rule
23
itself.
rule
23
in
its
own
terms
provides
that
any
order
certifying
or
refusing
to
certify
a
class
action
is
conditional
and
it
provides
that
it
may
be
altered
or
amended
at
any
time
by
definition
therefore
the
class
action
determination
is
not
final,
moreover
even
if
rule
23
did
not
so
provide
general
concepts
of
judicial
husbandry
reveal
that
the
trial
court
has
continuing
jurisdiction
over
prior
orders
and
has
the
power
to
amend
them
anytime
prior
to
final
disposition
of
a
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
assumes
that
it
will
not
your
honor
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
death
knell
doctrine
really
is
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
determination
that
this
matter
shall
never
be
adjudicated
on
a
classwide
basis
is
somehow
preserved
for
appellate
review.
now,
the
fact
that
the
individual
petitioner,
the
individual
plaintiff
in
a
case
may
not
choose
to
go
forward
does
not
mean
these
issues
are
forever
resolves.
you
have
a
possibility
of
intervention,
you
have
a
possibility
of
another
class
action
been
filed
and
you
have
the
possibility
that
if
this
plaintiff’s
claim
really
does
not
have
entered
that
he
chooses
sooner
or
later
will
be
able
to
obtain
class
certification
may
be
because
someone
else
is
willing
to
come
in
and
join
us
in
intervening.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor
i
see
no
reason
by
notice
he
could
file
a
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
he
could
certainly
seek
to
maintain
a
class
action.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
would
be
no
res
judicata
problem
with
it.
the
basis
for
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
why
this
class
action
was
decertified
had
to
do
with
the
adequacy
of
the
class
plaintiffs
and
with
the
delay
that
they
had
caused
if
an
adequate
plaintiff,
an
adequate
representative
came
in
and
asked
to
be
name
the
class
representative,
we
would
still
contend
that
the
class
action
is
not
manageable
and
improper
for
other
reasons,
but
there
are
the
same
reasons
that
we
have
raised
before
in
this
proceeding,
but
there
is
no
res
judicata
problem
with
it
or
a
collateral
estoppel
in
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
see
more
reason
to
differentiate
mr.
justice
white
that
these
rules
that
have
gone
up
around
the
death
knell
doctrine
have
been
applied
in
both
incidences,
both
were
initial
refusals
to
certify
and
ultimate
decertification
that
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
your
honor,
there
are
at
least
two
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
but
in
the
korn
and
milberg
cases
in
the
second
circuit,
one
of
those
was
a
decertification
as
distinguished
from
a
refusal
to
send.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
has
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
has
terminated
in
this
case
as
a
class
action
and
to
the
extent
that
their
interest
were
represented
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
but
not
to
their
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
as
far
as
the
absent
class
members
are
concerned.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
court
has
held
that
for
instance
statute
of
limitation
purposes
that
it
is
a
class
action
until
from
the
time
it
has
filed
until
an
order
is
entered
refusing
to
certify
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
way
it
is
usually
implied,
but
our
position
is
that
it
really
does
not
make
any
difference
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
you
would
have
to
send
another
notice
advising
them
that
it
had
been
terminated
i
would
think,
but
as
a
result
it
would
be
the
same.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
it
would
not
be
appealed
your
honor.
second
major
problem
with
the
death
knell
doctrine
we
think
is
that
requires
the
appellate
court
to
make
a
determination
of
finality
on
a
record
that
it
is
ordinarily
unsuited
to
such
a
determination.
the
record
that
is
made
before
the
trial
court
on
a
question
of
whether
the
class
action
should
be
certified
does
not
address
the
issue
what
will
happen
if
it
is
not
certified?
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
indicated
that
it
will
only
accept
death
knell
appeals
if
that
record
does
affirmatively
show
that
in
the
absence
of
certification
there
will
be
no
further
continuance,
but
we
think
that
to
the
extent
of
the
death
knell
doctrine
interjects
the
appellate
court
under
the
fact
finding
process
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
unwise
and
it
is
unsound
and
usually
it
requires
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
a
guess
as
to
the
intentions
of
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
i
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
thing
for
him
to
inquire
into
and
for
you
to
produce
if
you
are
the
plaintiff
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
you
have
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
death
knell
will
sound
if
you
are
refused
class
certification.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
way
that
the
burden
of
the
death
knell
doctrine
has
been
ameliorated
somewhat
by
one
court.
we
think
that
except
for
that
kind
of
a
ruling
to
the
death
knell
doctrine
does
embody
an
inefficient
use
of
manpower
because
of
the
requirement
that
the
appellate
courts
try
to
come
through
the
record
made
for
other
purposes
to
make
an
informed
or
perhaps
uninformed
guess
as
to
whether
the
plaintiffs’
counsel
deemed
to
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
oh,
you
are
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
and
that
is
united
airlines
v.
mcdonald
i
think.
that
is
exactly
what
was
held
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
appeal
relates
only
to
the
class
certification
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
no
he
can
appeal
only
at
such
time
as
there
is
a
final
judgment.
i
am
sorry
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
it
held
that
were
the
refusal
to
certify
occurred
and
then
the
case
later
went
either
to
settlement
or
judgment
then
the
intervener
can
come
in
and
test
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
he
could
intervene
certainly,
but
he
could
not
appeal.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
because
the
case
has
not
been
dismissed
in
its
entirety
the
final
judgment
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
is
not
really
his
case.
the
case
is
filed
by
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
he
got
notice
saying
there
has
been
a
lawsuit
filed
and
you
are
a
member
of
the
class
on
whose
behalf
it
is
being
prosecuted.
now,
until
that
case
is
dismissed.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
right,
but
your
honor
there
is
no
final
judgment
in
any
case
until
an
order
is
entered
disposing
of
all
parties
and
all
issues
and
the
fact
that
two
or
three
plaintiffs
are
dismissed
out
of
a
case
or
all
but
one
for
instance
does
not
make
it
a
final
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
in
mcdonalds
eventually
itself.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct.
no
just
a
reason
for
delay
yes.
our
third
quarrel
with
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
that
it
destroys
the
certainty
and
the
predictability
that
section
1291
was
designed
to
achieve.
in
some
incidences
i
can
conceive
if
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
adopted,
a
lawyer
is
required
to
file
one
appeal
in
an
interlocutory
situation
just
to
make
sure
that
the
order
that
was
entered
is
not
deemed
to
final
and
later
if
the
case
is
over
and
therefore
he
is
barred
from
appeal
that
was
the
dickinson
case
some
years
ago.
i
think
it
will
also
spend
considerable
number
of
new
request
for
exceptions
to
the
final
judgment
rule
producing
a
flat
of
interlocutory
appeals
which
will
overwhelm
and
already
overburden
federal
appellate
courts.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
were
certainly
the
number
of
appeals
that
triples
since
1966
your
honor
how
many
of
that
are
attributable
to
the
death
knell
doctrine
i
cannot
tell
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
second
and
the
eighth.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
the
ninth
even
more
modified.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
do
not
have
any
statistics
under
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
certainly
if
you
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
if
you
permit
any
plaintiff
who
files
a
class
action
and
then
he
is
denied
the
right
to
represent
class
to
file
an
interlocutory
appeal,
are
you
going
to
increase
the
number
of
appeals
filed
and
you
are
also
going
to
increase
the
number
of
class
actions
that
are
filed.
i
can
prove
that
that
is
what
senses
tell
me.
i
think
also
the
logical
corollary
of
the
death
knell
doctrine
is
that
any
time
i
can
convince
an
appellate
court
that
i
do
not
want
to
continue
my
case
any
further
because
it
is
economically
undesirable
for
me
to
continue
in
the
lack
of
an
order
that
has
been
entered
and
logically
i
should
be
able
to
appeal
that
order.
that
is
really
what
the
death
knell
doctrine
says.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
anything.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
right,
irrespective
with
the
class
action
question
anytime
i
can
convince
the
court
that
that
order
has
effectively
prevented
me
from
wanting
to
continue
my
case
further
i
would
be
able
to
appeal
it
because
that
is
the
exact
rationale
of
the
death
knell
doctrine.
we
think
certainly
too
that
the
death
knell
doctrine
has
thus
been
recognized
by
many
courts
and
fairly
discriminates
against
class
action
defendants
and
in
favor
of
class
action
plaintiffs
an
order
refusing
to
certify
a
class
action
is
immediately
appealable
under
the
death
knell
doctrine.
on
the
other
hand,
an
order
granting
class
certification
is
not
appealable.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
second
circuit
has
experimented
with
what
they
call
the
reverse
death
knell
doctrine
and
has
applied
that
in
a
couple
of
cases
and
has
earlier
concluded
that
it
really
has
many
more
workable
than
the
death
knell
doctrine
itself
and
although
i
think
in
my
own
opinion
that
more
often
to
not
the
grant
of
class
certification
it
is
the
death
knell
type
of
case
than
the
refusal
of
the
grant
because
experience
shows
us
that
overwhelming
majority
of
these
class
actions
particularly
in
the
securities
area
are
settled
and
not
applied
because
of
the
interarm
(ph)
effect
of
the
grant
of
the
class
certification,
but
again
that
is
that
calls
for
speculation
as
does
this
whole
area
and
that
is
why
the
certainty
that
the
1291
has
built
and
has
been
denied.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
have
a
couple
of
brief
points
to
make.
first
is
mr.
justice
stevens
has
indicated
the
death
knell
doctrine
does
encourage
litigation
by
class
action
representatives
who
have
the
least
at
stake
as
we
have
pointed
out
here
at
this
claim
by
these
respondents
was
some
$2,650.
yet
the
record
shows
that
the
counsel
that
originally
filed
that
on
our
behalf
also
represented
one
claimant
without
half
a
million
dollar
loss
and
other
claimant
who
had
$140,000
loss
who
was
a
neighbor
of
his
we
know
him
for
25
years
and
whom
he
described
as
a
millionaire.
now,
i
suggest
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
your
honor
the
district
court
in
its
october
23,
1975
order
suggested
an
order
that
a
notice
go
out
to
the
class
members
suggesting
that
they
apply
for
appointment
as
class
representatives
and
that
problem
was
solved
in
that
manner.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
was
proposed
to
go
out
at
the
time
that
the
class
action
was
decertified.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
did
not
go
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
if
there
had
been
cooperation
by
the
respondents
in
the
preparation
and
dissemination
of
that
notice,
it
would
have
gone
out.
your
honor
that
is
what
the
trial
court
was
trying
to
do
to
get
a
class
representative
who
could
find
answer
then
who
was
adequate.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
this
particular
amount
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
very
long.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
but
the
millionaire
had
a
loss
of
$140,000
suppose
if
they
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
i
said
that
it
is
a
viable
alternative
in
some
of
matters
but
i
would
not
take
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
we
would
oppose
it
in
this
case
your
honor
yes
sir
we
are.
i
think
it
is
not
a
(inaudible)
but
i
think
in
the
liberty
mutual
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
in
this
case
i
would
your
honor.
in
a
lot
of
class
action
analysis
it
might
be
appropriate
and
others
it
might
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
your
honor
they
have
not
cross
petition
from
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
is
only
mandamus
case
in
a
class
action
context
that
i
am
aware
of
it
is
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
it
ordered
the
district
court
judge
to
decertify
a
class
that
he
had
certified.
i
know
if
no
other
cases
ordering
the
court
to
certify
the
case
under
mandamus.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
he
will
your
honor
he
is
entitled
to
appeal
under
those
circumstances
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor
that
is
our
position
and
i
think
united
airlines
against
mcdonald
so
contemplates
because
the
rationale
there
was
that
the
other
stewards
who
was
the
bystander
had
the
right
to
assume
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
that
was
the
assumption.
that
also
has
happened
in
esplin
v.
hirschi
in
the
tenth
circuit
your
honor
and
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
correct,
but
the
assumption
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
and
the
intervener
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
the
assumption
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
assumption
to
justify
that
timeliness
holding
as
to
the
intervener
was
that
she
could
expect
the
class
representative
the
named
plaintiff
to
appeal
even
if
she
want.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
and
judge
cites
in
his
conquering
opinion
in
the
gardener
case
which
his
next
case
will
here
also
a
reason
that
if
the
named
plaintiff
goes
to
his
or
her
case
and
does
when
he
still
has
a
right
to
appeal
a
prior
denial
of
class
certification.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
on
the
class
question?
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
case
goes
back
for
a
trial
on
a
class
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
am
assuming
that
when
the
case
goes
up
that
is
going
to
be
appealed
both
on
his
individual
claim
and
on
the
class
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
well
he
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
you
tried
as
to
his
individual
claim
that
would
be
the
law
of
a
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
as
i
see
that
if
the
only
question
on
appeal
was
the
denial
of
the
class
certification
and
that
was
reversed,
the
case
will
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
the
class
issues
would
be
adjudicated
and
the
claim
of
the
individual
plaintiff
would
no
longer
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
the
1966
amendments
to
rule
23
were
designed
to
overcome
that
obstacles
of
hansberry
v.
lee
when
they
say
you
can
do
that
now
and
that
would
be
in
my
position.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
has
been
used
1292(b),
it
has
been
used
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
can
see
that
it
could
be
in
a
lot
of
class
action
question
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
in
some
cases
i
would
have
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
your
honor
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief.
you
may
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
in
some
cases
it
could
be
used
to
appeal
the
refusal
to
certify.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
has
been
used
and
i
cannot
put
my
finger
on
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
