justice
thurgood
marshall
your
point
was
that
providing
congress
a
move?
justice
thurgood
marshall
going
with
the
civil
rights
act
what
authority
does
the
governor
have?
is
he
the
chief
executive
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
he
did
enforce
the
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
the
authority
to
enforce
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
why
is
he
not
subject
to
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
this
court
said
that
a
governor
of
state
of
ohio
was
subject
to
suit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
understand
what
you
say
the
governor
is
nothing,
he
just
sits
there
and
that
cannot
be
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
is
he
not
subject
to
suit
if
he
runs
the
day-to-day
affairs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
does
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
who
owns
the
tribe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
congress
mean
when
they
said
tribe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
you
think
that
that
meant
little
better
than
thinking.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
there
is
nothing
there
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
the
point
as
to
who
is
to
be
member
of
the
tribe
involved
in
the
cultural
survival
of
that
tribe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
that
not
basic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
as
important
as
citizenship
is
to
the
citizen
of
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
as
important?
justice
thurgood
marshall
different
to
what
extent,
as
to
the
culture
of
the
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
the
loss
to
the
individual,
i
am
talking
about
the
culture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
saying
that
who
is
eligible
to
be
a
member
of
a
tribe
as
it
is
important
as
anything
i
know
to
a
culture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
c-u-l-t-u-r-e
is
what
i
am
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
they
not
have
set
up
a
culture
and
said
you
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
tribe,
get
out;
unless
you
are
full
blooded
tribal
indian
of
this
tribe
get
out,
is
anything
wrong
with
that
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
council
adopts
that,
it
is
approved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
assume
that
they
are
members
of
the
tribe
and
i
thought
that
is
why
we
were
here
to
decide?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
certain
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,?
not
in
her
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
a
male
member
of
a
tribe,
one
of
these
matriarchal
tribe
brings
this
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
answer
to
my
question
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you
that
is
the
best
you
could
do.
