mr.
richard
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
basic
disagreements
between
the
parties
in
this
case
has
been
the
defendants’
characterization
of
what
tribal
interest
is
represented
by
this
ordinance,
that
is
at
issue
here.
they
have
said
as
counsel
just
said
at
the
close
of
his
argument
that
without
this
ordinance
the
culture
and
religion
of
santa
clara
would
be
lost
and
destroyed.
we
submit
that
this
cannot
possibly
be
the
case.
the
court
below
and
the
district
court
in
their
opinions
each
state
that
the
martinez
children
are
culturally
santa
clara
indians.
they
found
that
to
be
a
fact.
that
finding
is
undisputed
so
far
before
this
court.
furthermore,
that
finding
is
based
on
a
number
of
significant
subsidiary
facts
that
are
also
undisputed
that
the
martinez
children
are
full
blood
american
indians
that
their
mother
is
a
full
blood
santa
clara
indian,
that
they
speak
and
understand
the
tewa
language
which
is
the
official
and
legal
language
of
the
santa
clara
pueblo.
in
fact,
the
expressed
witness
for
defendants
to
which
counsel
just
referred
to
find
the
santa
clara
indian
as
a
tewa
indian
as
one
who
speaks
the
tewa
language.
he
defined
the
indians
in
question
according
to
the
language.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
mr.
justice,
my
point
is
addressed
to
the
tribal
interest
asserted
as
a
justification
for
this
ordinance.
they
have
constantly
said
that
without
the
ordinance
their
culture
would
be
lost
and
we
submit
that
cannot
be
the
case
because
the
persons
who
were
so
closely
identified
with
the
culture
as
these
persons
are
excluded
by
the
ordinance
and
conversely
the
ordinance
mandates
the
admission
of
male
line
children,
even
if
they
grow
up
in
chicago
or
los
angeles
or
what
have
you,
even
if
there
are
half
or
quarter
or
less
indian
ancestors,
even
if
they
have
never
seen
santa
clara
pueblo,
even
if
they
know
nothing
of
its
language.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
the
issue
of
culture
was
raised
by
the
defendants
not
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
plaintiffs
suggested
that
the
record
is
clear
that
this
ordinance
was
not
based
on
any
cultural
interest
of
the
pueblo,
but
based
on
a
desire
to
limit
membership
to
keep
up
the
amount
of
the
per
capita
payments
that
the
government
was
making
to
the
tribe.
we
think
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
culture
was
raised
by
them
as
a
defense
and
we
are
forced
to
meet
that,
but
we
did
not
raise
the
issue,
and
furthermore
your
honor,
in
any
indian
civil
rights
act
case
a
tribe
that
has
any
differing
traditions
from
a
state
or
a
local
government
under
the
united
states
is
going
to
have
some
cultural
involvement
in
that
decision
and
therefore
the
indian
civil
rights
if
tradition
or
culture
were
an
automatic
and
absolute
defense
to
an
indian
civil
rights
act
action
then
the
act
is
meaningless.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
your
honor
not
that
at
all.
we
are
only
saying
that
the
record
we
think
is
overwhelmingly
clear
that
the
cultural
defense
is
mistakenly
raised
by
the
defendants
because
it
cannot
possibly
maintain
culture
to
enforce
a
rule
like
this.
that
is
what
judge
doyle
had
clearly
said
in
defense
of
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
it
is
your
honor,
that
goes
to
a
different
point.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
it
is
basic
mr.
justice
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
it
is
basic
to
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor
i
think
they
are
rather
different.
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
necessarily
equivalent.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
united
states
citizenship
issue
usually
arise
in
the
case
of
an
alien
someone
who
is
not
brought
up
in
the
culture
of
the
united
states,
if
these
plaintiffs
are
denied
membership
in
the
tribe
that
they
were
brought
up.
they
have
lived
all
their
lives
on
the
reservation,
the
loss
to
them
would
be
much
greater
than
the
effect
on
a
true
alien
who
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
but
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
crucial
difference
in
the
cultural
impact
between
outsiders,
persons
who
have
not
grown
up
in
the
society
and
persons
insiders
those
who
have
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
that
presents
very
different
questions.
what
they
have
done
here?
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
what
they
have
done
here
is
to
pass
a
rule
that
discriminates
between
members
of
the
tribe.
it
says
to
one
group,
it
says
to
women,
your
children
may
not
become
members.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
the
plaintiff
julia
martinez
is
a
member
it
is
her
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
for
all
purposes.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor
that
is
a
mistake
that
counsel
made.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
is
an
inheritance
rule
to
the
man
only
in
this
tribe,
nothing
in
the
record.
that
is
a
mischaracterization
of
the
record
because
it
is
clear
enough
that
if
mrs.
martinez
had
married
a
member
of
the
tribe,
her
children
could
inherit
from
her.
there
is
no
prohibition
against
inheritance
through
the
female
line.
the
only
thing
is
there
is
a
prohibition
against
passing
membership
to
your
children,
but
not
a
prohibition
against
inheritance
as
a
general
matter.
she
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
mr.
justice
i
will
be
happy
to
address
those
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
the
two
jurisdictional
issues
that
have
been
raised
that
whether
they
are
federal
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
tribe
precludes
such
jurisdiction.
the
inquiry
into
those
is
fairly
to
tell
that
i
must
refer
in
part
to
our
briefs,
but
i
will
outline
our
answers
to
the
contentions.
the
main
answer
is
we
contend
that
the
congress
contemplated
that
these
kinds
of
reviews
would
be
heard
by
the
federal
courts
and
in
fact,
this
is
the
tenth
year
of
the
statute,
the
lower
federal
courts,
all
four
court
of
appeals
that
have
looked
at
this
statute
have
said
we
have
power
to
review
and
that
sovereign
immunity
does
not
bar
that
review.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
several
responses
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
not
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
thought
that
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
in
the
second
place
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
is
always
a
statutory
remedy
at
the
present
time
and
has
been
for
some
years
and
equitable
remedies
are
specially
exercised
against
government
officers
have
usually
not
been
a
statutory
remedy
that
is
the
normal
assumption.
furthermore,
the
legislative
history
is
a
confusing
point
here
because
we
are
relying
on
different
parts
of
the
legislative
history
and
i
think
it
is
really
essential
to
answer
this
question
and
some
others
to
make
clear
where
the
legislative
history
lies.
counsel
for
defendants
has
principally
relied
upon
hearings,
upon
testimony
before
hearings
including
testimony
of
persons
who
oppose
passage
of
the
act.
we
submit
that
that
does
not
accurately
reflect
what
congress
intended
to
do.
there
is
one
and
only
one
committee
report
on
the
bill
that
became
this
act
or
any
of
the
bills
leading
up
to
it.
a
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
1967,
in
that
report
the
senators
state,
they
have
a
section
on
unconstitutional
actions
of
tribal
governments,
discussing
the
subject,
in
that
section
the
referred
to
five
decisions
of
the
lower
federal
courts
denying
a
civil
remedy
in
a
civil
non-custody
context
to
indians
in
disputes
with
their
tribes
and
they
are
obviously
expressing
disapproval
of
those
decisions,
one
of
those
five
arose
in
the
context
of
tribal
membership.
we
submit
that
the
report
of
the
senators
themselves
indicates
that
they
contemplated
that
the
federal
courts
would
review
membership
cases
and
the
other
cases
in
that
report
are
there
two
cases
on
freedom
free
exercise
of
religion,
and
there
is
a
case
on
tribal
taxation
of
members
and
there
is
a
case
on
tribal
taxation
of
non-indians
on
the
reservation
and
all
of
those
the
senators
were
expressing
disapproval
of
the
lack
of
a
remedy
for
those
plaintiffs
and
they
were
saying
that
this
is
why
this
act
was
passed.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
established
anti-establishment
clause.
how
one
differentiates
between
those
is
yet
to
come?
now,
returning
to
the
sovereign
immunity
question,
the
terms
of
the
act
are
mandatory
on
their
face.
the
act
is
a
limitation
on
the
tribes
themselves.
congress,
it
is
conceded
has
plenary
power
to
limit
the
tribes
in
this
way.
defendants
have
conceded
that.
that
is
not
the
power
of
congress
to
do
this.
is
that
not
issue.
it
is
only
a
question
of
what
congress
did
do?
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
in
this
case
the
tribal
court
and
the
tribal
legislature
are
one
and
the
same.
the
lower
courts
have
developed
a
rule
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel,
or
salutary
rule
saying
that
a
plaintiff
to
bring
a
case
to
the
federal
courts
must
first
exhaust
all
his
internal
remedies
within
the
tribes.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
rule
of
the
district
court
found
without
contradiction
that
we
had
done
that
in
this
case
and
of
course,
that
i
am
sure
has
resolved
in
the
context
of
some
other
tribes
and
number
of
disputes,
the
existence
of
that
rule,
but
this
tribe
has
no
separate
court.
there
is
no
separate
review.
all
you
need
to
go
to
do
is
go
back
to
the
same
officers
with
whom
you
have
a
quarrel
and
in
addition
the
act
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
that
was
attempted
for
two
years
before
this
case
was
filed.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes.
i
was
just
answering
the
inquiry
really
that
was
made
during
my
brother’s
argument.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
the
written
constitution
of
the
pueblo
says
that
he
has
all
the
executive
authority
of
the
pueblo,
the
authority
to
enforce
all
the
laws
and
we
assume
that
included
membership
laws,
we
still
assume
that.
we
take
the
written
laws
at
their
word,
it
is
in
the
appendix.
we
would
point
out
in
connection
with
the
scope
of
the
act
again
that
the
act
on
its
face
limits
and
these
are
the
words
of
the
statute,
“all
governmental
powers
possessed
by
an
indian
tribe
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
and
all
offices,
bodies
and
tribunals
by
and
through
which
they
are
executed
including
courts”.
so
it
is
comprehensive
the
act
on
its
face
and
its
terms
is
comprehensive
in
defining
what
it
limits.
that
relates
to
one
of
arguments
that
has
been
made
by
my
brother
which
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
this
act
should
be
interpreted
only
to
enforce
existing
tribal
rules
evenhandedly,
i
believe
they
call
it.
in
the
first
place
of
course,
the
act
says
that
the
legislative
councils
of
the
tribe
are
limited
as
well
as
the
administrative
and
this
evenhanded
rule
of
course
would
only
go
to
the
administration
of
a
law,
and
in
the
second
place
such
a
rule
would
make
a
marker
here
of
the
equal
protection
clause
because
as
soon
as
an
uneven
application
arose
all
that
would
be
necessary
to
make
it
immune
from
any
review
would
be
for
the
legislature
to
codify
that
rule,
so
that
rule
makes
no
sense
to
us
and
we
submit
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
such
an
undertaking
as
particularly
since
congress
paid
special
attention,
the
senators
paid
special
attention
to
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
law.
when
the
law
was
drafted
by
the
interior
department,
there
was
an
equal
protection
clause
in
it,
that
guaranteed
equal
protection
only
to
members
of
the
tribe
and
the
senators
did
not
like
that
and
they
changed
it
in
guaranteed
equal
protection
to
all
persons
under
tribal
jurisdiction.
a
point
which
has
been
noted
by
lower
courts
in
some
other
cases.
so
the
senators
took
a
particular
look
at
the
question
of
equal
protection
and
they
rejected
an
error
with
clause,
in
which
regard
i
might
add,
there
a
reply
brief
was
just
filed
by
petitioners
in
which
they
quote
some
legislative
history
about
equal
protection
and
they
quote
legislative
history
about
that
rejected
clause
applying
only
to
members
of
the
tribe
and
they
do
not
disclose
that
and
so
i
think
the
court
should
note
that
that
legislative
history
does
not
apply
to
the
clause
that
was
actually
enacted
by
the
congress.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
suppose
not
in
every
last
particular
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
again,
i
must
refer
to
our
briefs
because
it
is
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
subject,
but
what
we
say
there
is
that
a
lot
of
the
faulty
analysis,
i
think,
lot
of
the
fears
that
had
been
raised
under
equal
protection
analysis
with
regard
to
indian
tribes
derived
from
a
totally
faulty
source.
they
have
taken
the
result
in
state
cases
and
transferred
that
laterally
to
indian
tribes
and
we
clearly
say
that
that
is
not
correct.
the
equal
protection
clause
must
be
applied
in
the
context
of
whatever
government
or
societies
being
applied
to
and
for
that
reason
we
concede
that
the
sensitive
issue
of
membership
is
entitled
to
wait
in
an
analyzing
in
equal
protection
situation.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
the
tribe’s
judgment
and
the
tribe’s
standards
and
the
tribe’s
traditions
are
entitled
to
wait
but
the
problem
with
this
particular
rule
is
that
if
they
claim
it
is
a
rule
based
in
culture
and
that
actually
has
a
counterproductive
effect
on
culture.
again,
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
is
the
function
of
the
courts
to
determine
every
last
cultural
nuance
of
the
tribe,
but
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes
your
honor,
the
balancing
approach
of
that
kind.
well,
i
do
not
know
if
balancing
is
a
correct
word.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
governmental
justifications
in
all
the
different
formulas
that
are
used
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
different
verbal
formulas,
governmental
interests
are
always
accorded
weight
according
to
the
circumstances
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
was
trying
to
address
different
points
of
view,
but
whatever
verbal
formula
is
used
the
governmental
interest
are
accorded
weight
and
since
the
indian
governmental
interest
in
many
context
will
be
different,
we
think
that
that
raises
different
analysis
for
application
of
the
clause.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
memberships
are
fundamental
in
fact,
your
honor
you
have
to
consider
also
the
importance
to
the
plaintiffs.
the
interior
department
issued
a
decision
in
1969,
a
year
after
this
act
was
enacted
in
which
they
term,
tribal
membership
for
a
person
raised
in
the
pueblo,
a
child,
like
this
was
a
different
tribe
not
a
pueblo
tribe
to
be
a
fundamental
interest.
the
interior
department
decision
called
it
that
and
they
ruled
that
a
tribal
rule
was
invalid
on
that
ground.
that
raises
a
point
that
was
made
earlier
in
secretary
of
interior
review.
the
problem
with
the
suggestion
that
that
is
a
sufficient
remedy,
is
in
the
first
place
by
the
way,
i
must
correct
the
record,
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ever
approved
this
rule.
we
tried
mightily
to
find
out
at
the
time
of
trial
if
he
had,
there
is
no
evidence
either
way,
whether
there
was
ever
approved
for
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
there
is
a
statutory
definition
your
honor.
it
says
indian
tribe
means
any
tribe,
band
or
other
group
of
indians
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
recognized
as
possessing
powers
of
self-government,
that
is
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
in
nineteenth
century
case
law
your
honor,
there
were
a
fair
number
of
decisions
in
this
court
that
adjudicated
that
kind
of
a
question
of
what
the
court
basically
said
is
that
a
political
question
for
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
do
you
mean
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
thought
you
are
referring
to
tribal
recognition
by
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
think
they
could
adjudicate.
i
think
it
presents
very
different
substantive
questions
and
very
very
different
substantive
questions
from
this
case.
the
thing
about
membership
is
a
sensitive
issue
and
we
concede
that,
but
it
is
extremely
important
issue
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
having
been
raised
in
the
culture
and
for
that
very
reason
it
is
of
less
importance
to
the
tribe
in
this
case
than
would
be
the
question
of
an
outsider.
it
is
like
the
difference
between
a
person
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states
applying
for
citizenship
versus
a
person
born
and
raised
in
france.
that
difference
we
think
goes
to
the
fundamental
irrationality
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
i
realized
that
your
honor,
but
i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
they
do
not
want
any
of
their
membership
rules
examined
ever
which
i
can
understand
their
position,
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
examining
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
very
exactly
when
they
say
that
to
expel
someone
as
culturally
identified
with
the
tribe
as
the
martinez
children
are,
cannot
possibly
have
the
importance
to
the
culture
of
the
tribe
as
they
describe
it,
it
just
cannot.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
your
honor
again
that
leads
down
the
slope
to
the
notion
that
nothing
is
reviewable
so
long
as
there
is
some
cultural
input
into
it.
congress
in
passing
the
act
has
said,
the
tribal
laws
are
subject
to
review.
all
of
those
tribal
laws
are
passed
at
a
social
and
cultural
milieu
that
somewhat
different
from
a
state
and
occasionally
issues
are
bound
to
arise
where
as
a
defense
to
some
act,
a
tribe
says,
we
are
allowed
to
do
that
for
cultural
reasons.
we
again
are
only
trying
to
meet
that
defense.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
court
or
any
court
should
determine
tribal
tradition
or
culture.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
i
am
saying
that
though
with
regard
only
to
a
rather
clear
and
dramatic
and
undisputed
fact
in
this
case
which
is
the
notion
of
insiders
versus
outsiders,
the
notion
that
these
people
are
raised
in
the
society
admitted
to
the
religion,
i
mean
the
literature
if
you
were
admitted
to
the
religion
of
this
pueblo
100
years
ago
that
was
tantamount
to
membership.
things
are
changed.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
came
along
and
said
to
this
tribe
you
got
to
have
a
written
tribal
rule,
that
is
something
new.
that
came
along
in
the
30's.
then
they
came
along
and
they
said
we
have
taken
some
land
away
from
you
and
we
are
going
to
pay
you
some
money
and
that
gave
arise
to
per
capita
payments
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
the
pueblo’s
own
records
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
what
the
council
had
in
mind
when
they
passed
this
rule
was
keeping
those
per
capita
payments
up,
nothing
more,
nothing
less.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
doubt
entirely
your
honor.
to
continuing
on
that
point
mr.
justice,
on
the
point
of
jurisdiction
rather,
there
is
a
long
tradition
in
the
federal
courts
of
enforcing
the
constitution
against
future
violations
by
equitable
relief
against
governments,
deriving
from
the
principle
of
ex
parte
young
and
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes
your
honor.
and
we
think
yes
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
we
think
the
reasoning
of
those
courts
is
correct
and
the
two
statutes
that
have
been
relied
upon
are
1331
on
the
ground
that
these
actions
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
1343,
the
civil
rights
jurisdiction
by
analogy
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
such
cases
as
allen
v.
the
board
of
elections,
that
is
particularly
relevant
case,
allen
v.
board
of
elections
case
because
the
court
implied
a
private
civil
remedy
in
that
case
and
despite
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
involved
in
that
case,
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
contained
a
narrower
civil
remedy,
not
criminal,
not
habeas
corpus
or
something
else
within
the
statute
and
in
other
actions
under
42
u.s.c.
1981,
42
u.s.c.
1982
and
other
circumstances
that
court
has
implied
a
private
civil
remedy
to
enforce
the
constitution
or
enforce
civil
rights
type
laws
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
if
the
remedy
is
in
the
intent
of
the
statute
mr.
justice
then
1343
does
give
you
a
remedy
that
seems
to
me
undisputed.
the
only
question
is
where
the
remedy
comes
from,
if
there
is
a
remedy
and
we
say
there
is
then
1343
gives
the
court
subject
matter
of
jurisdiction.
now,
again
mr.
justice
stewart
i
would
refer
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
with
the
senators
saying
we
disapprove
of
these
cases
where
the
federal
courts
have
dismissed
actions
by
individual
indians
trying
to
rectify
a
membership
case,
tax
case,
free
exercise
case.
the
senators
in
the
written
word
have
indicated
their
intent
that
there
would
be
a
remedy.
they
are
disapproving
expressly
of
cases
where
a
remedy
was
denied.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
it
is
like
any
other
civil
rights
statute
certainly
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
the
federal
courts
have
said
that
they
must
be
first
invoked
in
the
courts
of
the
tribes,
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
because
it
is
fundamental
civil
rights
there
at
issue
your
honor
and
the
court
has
a
consistent,
in
the
bevens
case
the
court
found
a
remedy
under
the
constitution
itself
and
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
but
we
have
relied
on
1331
your
honor
and
the
senators
over
and
over
said
we
are
applying
certain
constitutional
provisions
to
these
indian
tribes.
that
is
what
we
are
doing
as
applying
the
constitution
in
the
context
of
disputes
by
any
person
against
an
indian
tribe
and
it
seems
to
me
analogy
is
quite
precise
that
if
the
action
arises
under
the
constitution
it
is
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
as
in
bevens
and
bell
v.
hood.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
no,
your
honor
because
congress
only
applied
certain
portions
of
the
constitution
to
the
indian
tribes
and
they
altered
other
portions,
but
we
do
say
that
those
portions
they
applied
are
equivalent,
yes,
and
that
the
legislative
record
is
rather
clear
on
that.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
i
think
well,
it
is
a
statutory
action
your
honor,
because
it
is
contained
in
a
statute
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reasoning
by
analogy
to
cases
like
bevens
is
apt
because
congress
intended
by
the
statute
to
apply
the
constitution
itself,
in
the
respects
in
which
it
did
so.
it
admitted
republican
form
of
government,
it
admitted
all
kinds
or
parts
of
a
constitution
quite
intentionally
and
for
good
reason,
but
where
it
did
apply
to
constitution,
we
suggest
that
the
analogy
to
other
civil
rights
cases
is
apt
in
this
regard.
and
we
would
also
cite
to
the
court’s
own
reasoning
in
the
cort
v.
ash,
i
do
not
have
time
to
go
down
the
four
steps
in
that
reasoning
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
because
again
we
are
talking
about
equal
protection
of
a
law
which
is
certainly
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
has
generally
been
enforced
in
the
federal
courts
and
not
else
where
not
in
the
state
courts
in
the
analogous
situation
and
secondly
because
the
whole
history
of
this
act
is
replete
with
the
notion
that
congress
was
to
satisfy
in
certain
respects
with
the
treatment
of
tribal
members
by
the
indian
tribes
and
what
they
are
saying
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
so
as
every
other
constitutional
question
because
the
constitution
has
never
been
applied
to
the
tribes
before
at
all.
we
acknowledge
the
sensitivity
of
membership
and
we
think
that
is
entitled
to
some
weight,
but
that
does
not.
they
are
trying
to
say
that
any
membership
rule
no
matter,
how
arbitrary
no
matter,
how
trivial
no
matter,
how
ill
conceived
is
entitled
to
any
review
under
the
statute,
under
the
first
amendment
as
applied,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
as
applied,
under
due
process
as
applied
and
congress
in
the
legislative
history
indicated
expressed
disapproval
of
a
tenth
circuit
decision
denying
a
remedy
to
an
indian
in
just
such
a
dispute.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
well,
your
honor
we
would,
if
you
are
talking
about
some
other
tribe
i
think
there
are
other
traditions
and
i
think
that
the
each
membership
rule
arises
in
the
context
of
that
tribe
and
each
written
membership
rule
arises
in
the
context
of
its
own
history.
we
say
it
is
clear
on
this
record
that
the
sole
purpose
of
this
rule
was
to
keep
up
those
per
capita
payments.
it
had
no
purpose
to
retain
that
the
rule
before
1939
--
mr.
richard
b.
collins
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
richard
b.
collins
the
transcript
was
your
honor,
the
matter
by
the
time
it
got
to
submission
to
the
district
court,
the
matter
was
essentially
not
very
much
contested
and
so
the
district
court
did
not
write
very
much
about
it.
essentially
there
was
a
long
history
of
spending
some
18
years
of
attempts
by
mrs.
martinez
to
get
her
children
at
home.
