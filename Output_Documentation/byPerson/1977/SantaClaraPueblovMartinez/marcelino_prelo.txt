mr.
marcelino
prelo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
case
involves
the
application
of
section
13028
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
as
it
applies
to
a
santa
clara
pueblo
membership
ordinance
enacted
in
1939.
the
ordinance
provides
that
children
born
of
santa
clara
males
and
santa
clara
females
shall
be
santa
clara
members.
children
born
of
santa
clara
males
and
non-
santa
clara
females
would
likewise
be
members
of
tribe
whereas
children
born
of
santa
clara
females
and
non-santa
clara
males
would
not
be
members
of
the
tribe.
the
plaintiffs
alleged
the
ordinance,
violates
the
indian
civil
rights
act
and
the
defendants
have
continuously
raised
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
tribe.
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
new
mexico
found
that
there
was
in
fact
jurisdiction
but
that
the
ordinance
did
not
violate
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
not
discussing
tribal
immunity
to
any
extent
whatsoever
and
finding
that
in
fact
there
was
jurisdiction
and
that
the
ordinance
was
violated.
a
little
factual
background
on
santa
clara
pueblo,
i
believe
would
be
beneficial
before
going
into
further
argument.
it
is
a
small
reservation,
some
4,800
acres.
the
membership
is
small
approximately
1,200
members,
located
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
it
is
a
pueblo
tribe
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
it
is
a
near
santa
fe,
i
mean
that
the
northern
santa
fe.
the
tribe
has
organized
pursuant
to
constitution,
one
of
the
organization
act
of
1934
and
it
is
un-contradicted
that
the
tribe
has
existed
as
a
distinct
social
and
cultural
unit
for
at
least
700
years
and
has
existed
at
its
present
location
for
some
300
years.
it
has
been
surrounded
first
by
the
spaniards
and
now
by
the
united
states
of
america
and
has
continued
to
exist
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
been
surrounded
by
an
alien
culture.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
use
then
identical
---
mr.
marcelino
prelo
the
governor,
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
tribe
that
is
empowered
to
run
a
day-to-day
functions
of
the
tribe
primarily
and
he
serves
on
the
council
and
can
only
vote
on
the
council
at
such
time
as
the
council
may
have
a
tribe
vote.
the
council
under
the
constitution
has
the
authority
to
determine
membership
in
the
tribe
and
has
thus
done
under
the
1939
ordinance.
the
defendants
in
this
case,
santa
clara
pueblo
have
from
the
very
outset,
claimed
that
the
1939
ordinance
is
a
written
embodiment
of
pre-existing
unwritten
rules
of
membership
and
i
might
point
out
that
prior
to
1935,
nothing
was
written
within
the
pueblo
culture.
they
had
no
written
rules.
they
have
further
alleged
throughout
and
do
so
that
the
ordinance
is
essential
to
the
cultural
and
religious
heritage
and
vital
to
the
very
existence
of
the
tribe.
there
has
been
no
variants
from
that
ordinance
from
the
time
it
was
enacted.
the
plaintiffs
mrs.
martinez
is
a
santa
clara
pueblan
daughter
of
both
parents
who
were
of
santa
clara.
under
the
ordinance,
her
children
are
not
members
of
the
santa
clara
because
she
is
married
to
an
navajo
from
a
separate
reservation.
the
testimony
was
clear
that
the
children
could
be
registered
in
an
idaho
nation,
had
they
so
desired.
the
question
presented
for
this
court
as
i
see
them
are
whether
or
not
there
is
an
implied
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
1968
civil
rights
act
and
whether
in
fact,
the
civil
rights
act
gives
federal
court’s
jurisdiction
in
anything
other
than
habeas
corpus
provisions.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
yes,
sir,
that
is
the
threshold
question.
if
we
get
passed
that
question
assuming
that
the
court
should
find
that
there
is
in
fact
a
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
yes
sir.
the
immunity
would
go
to
jurisdiction
and
if
they
are
immune
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
today
in
court.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
under
the
habeas
corpus
your
honor,
we
submit
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
the
individual
that
might
be
paying
any
given
(inaudible)--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
the
act
states
that
it
applies
to
tribe.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
the
executives.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
it
would
apply
to
the
governor
and
based
on
what
i
have
indicated
a
while
ago,
the
governor
just
has
the
power
to
run
the
day-to-day
affairs
and
has
no
power
beyond
that
into
the
counciliary.
so
i
do
not
know
what
effect
that
would
have.
if
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
there
is
jurisdiction
then
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
standard
of
equal
protection
should
apply
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
we
have
submitted
and
have
argued
consistently
that
there
is
something
less
under
fourteenth
amendment
standard
and
that
has
been
admitted
by
the
plaintiffs
at
the
early
stages
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
speaking
of
the
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity,
there
has
been
over
145
years
that
this
court
held
the
tribes
are
sovereign
nations.
notwithstanding
in
the
quasi-sovereign
at
this
particular
time.
they
still
retain
the
independent
political
sovereignty
that
was
found
by
the
court
over
100
years
ago,
82
years
ago
at
least
it
has
been
recognized
that
as
sovereigns
are
immune
from
suit
in
federal
courts
unless
congress
and
congress
has
plenary
power
to
do
so,
unless
congress
enacts
legislation
saying
that
they
can
be
sued,
if
their
immunity
is
waived,
such
waiver
has
never
been
implied
and
we
submit
that
it
should
not
be
at
this
time.
it
must
be
an
expressed
waiver
and
congress
must
spell
this
out.
this
court
in
the
recent
cases,
pequot
tribe
of
washington
decided
just
in
june
again
reaffirmed
the
common
law
principle
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
reasons
for
this
principle
have
been
pointed
out
are
two-fold,
one
is
because
of
the
limited
resources
of
the
tribes
to
be
constantly
in
court
defending
their
culture,
their
way
of
living
and
the
other
is
so
that
they
may
continue
to
perpetuate
their
culture
without
interference
from
an
outside
alien
culture
if
you
will.
the
plaintiffs
in,
i
might
point
it
out
that
there
has
been
a
half-a-million
dollar
judgment
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act
in
the
tenth
circuit
as
is
pointed
out
by
amicus,
just
recently.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
the
elements
are
the
preservation
of
the
culture,
the
preservation
of
the
tribal
cohesiveness,
the
unit
of
the
tribe,
their
religious
beliefs
and
to
some
extent
their
economic
holdings
which
are
as
i
have
indicated
small.
it
is
the
overall
keeping
of
a
tribe
which
existed
for
years
that
it
is
slowly
under
this
approach
going
to
be
destroyed.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
it
is
totally
inconsistent
i
would
say
your
honor.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
and
that
this
was
done
because
we
were
on
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
based
on
the
more
equal
footing.
at
that
time
the
tribes
were
stronger
compared
to
what
they
are
today,
as
compared
to
the
united
states
and
it
was
beneficial
to
this
country
to
make
such
treaties
and
agreements
and
we
should
continue
to
honor
these.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
well,
i
would
not
argue
that
treaties
would
be
entered
into
this
particular
time,
your
honor.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
worcester
v.
georgia.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
going
on
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
waiver
it
must
be
expressed
and
should
not
be
implied.
we
were
talking
about
the
reasons
for
it,
again
the
plaintiffs
have
not
told
us
how
they
would
propose
to
limit
judgments
to
equitable
relief
and
not
have
money
judgments.
the
waiver
also,
i
might
point
out
would
have
an
excessive
workload
for
the
courts
that
the
courts
may
not
be
geared
to
and
it
would
do
unduly
interfere
with
tribal
law
and
order
systems.
this
was
considered
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
your
honor,
my
argument
no
that
is
the
intention
primarily
was
to
avoid
criminal
type
lack
of
due
process
in
the
tribal
courts,
that
was
the
the
bulk
of
a
legislative
history
there
are
other
mentions
with
budgeting.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
if
they
did
not
the
secretary
of
the
interior
would
definitely
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
missed
the
initial
thoughts
what
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
do
the
courts
have
that
authority?
mr.
marcelino
prelo
the
tribal
courts
do
not.
well,
the
tribal
courts
could
certainly
change
this
ordinance
because
they
have
that
authority
under
the
constitution.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
to
make
it
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
they
have
the
authority
to
make
the
ordinance
by
assuming
that
they
have
the
authority
to
unmake
that
the
way
they
can
pass
such
ordinance.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
think
that
they
can.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
within
the
tribe,
i
think
that
that
is
true.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
we
would
like
to
think
it
indian
tribal
law
is
subject
to
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
subject
to
the
indian
civil
rights
act
now,
as
applied
in
the
context
of
the
indian
tribal
courts.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
think
you
are
correct
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
providing
congress
as
so
indicated
and
we
take
the
position
that
congress
had
not
so
indicated,
congress
has
only
indicated
that
there
should
be
a
specific
remedy
which
is
habeas
corpus.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
in
the
tribe?
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
but
they
do
have
and
are
getting
more
codes
and
setting
up
separate
judges
under
modal
codes
of
the
interior
department
as
promulgated.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
your
honor,
in
all
of
these
areas,
it
varies
from
tribe
to
tribe.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
your
honor,
it
does
because
it
would
be
applied
within
a
tribal
courts
and
it
would
have
the
secretary
looking
over
it
as
far
as
approving
ordinances
and
reviewing
anything
that
the
tribe
does
that
is
subject
to
the
secretary’s
approval,
they
would
have.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
think
that
is
probable.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct.
he
would
have
to
approve
it
initially.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
this
ordinance
was
approved
i
believe
or
not
i
do
not
want
to
be
held
to
that
your
honor
i
think
it
was
approved
and
it
was
patched.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct.
the
jurisdictional
issue,
reliance
has
been
placed
on
28
u.s.c.
13434,
i
submit
that
this
reliance
is
misplaced.
that
requires
that
the
district
courts
to
have
the
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
authorized
by
laws
to
be
commenced
and
we
submit
that
nothing
has
been
authorized
in
the
civil
rights
act
except
habeas
corpus
and
as
a
result
reliance
on
this
is
improper
and
this
court
has
ruled
in
similar
cases
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
califano
v.
sanders
and
in
testan
recently.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
your
honor,
it
makes
a
difference
because
i
think
that
the
act
specifically
applies
to
tribes
number
one,
and
secondly
because
the
governor
himself
would
not
have
the
authority,
the
council
would
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
ordinances
concerning
membership.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
it
is
my
position
that
it
would
not
be
proper.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
because
i
think
the
act
speaks
to
the
tribe
itself
and
not
an
individual
and
that
the
governor
does
not
have
the
requisite
authority
in
any
event
to
tell
the
council,
i
would
assume
then
a
council
would
have
to
become
also
involved
because
the
governor
does
not
have
the
authority
to
tell
the
council.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
he
is
the
chief
executive
and
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
he
enforces
the
law
and
order
portions
of
it,
but
he
does
not
have
the
authority
to
pass
an
ordinance
or
to
not
get
an
ordinance.
that
would
be
against
the
council.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
he
has
the
authority
to
enforce
it.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
if
he
enforces
it
wrongfully,
he
perhaps
could
be
subject
to
suit.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
and
therefore
in
the
indian
context
that
would
not
necessarily
follow
because
of
the
different
power
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
he
did
not
just
sit
there,
he
runs
the
day-to-day
affairs.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
because
the
act
addresses
tribes.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
addresses
the
tribes,
he
said
no
tribe
show.
he
did
not
say
no
person.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
submit
that
the
council,
and
i
do
not
know
the
religious
leader.
these
are
things
we
do
not
know
the
people
behind
--
the
secular
people.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
i
think
they
meant
the
political
body
that
council
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
they
must
have
meant
the
political
body
which
would
be
the
council.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
no,
it
is
not
clear
what
is
that?
as
to
the
standard
of
equal
protection
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
consistently
taken
the
approach
that
indians
are
sure
generous
and
different
from
any
other
body
in
the
country.
that
have
been
treated
with
difference,
things
have
been
considered
by
this
court
that
had
been
in
the
other
group,
but
a
different
ruling
would
have
been
arrived
at,
for
example,
morton
v.
mancari,
the
fisher
case.
we
think
that
congress
intended
that
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
be
utilized
and
that
they
would
later
look
at
the
entire
case
and
if
that
was
not
sufficient
they
can
enact
new
legislation
and
mandate
to
the
courts
what
they
want.
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
indian
tribes
from
maintaining
their
traditional
criteria
for
establishing
their
membership.
i
might
point
out
that
not
only
santa
clara
is
affected
by
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
but
every
tribe
in
the
nation,
13
tribes
as
noticed
in
amicus
briefs,
13
other
tribes
in
the
nation
have
either
female
or
male
descendancy
rules,
so
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
santa
clara,
it
is
a
question
of
all
indian
nations
throughout
the
country.
all
tribes
are
struggling
to
remain
culturally
and
politically
viable.
right
now,
they
are
finding
it
difficult
because
tremendous
amount
of
lawsuits
are
being
filed
against
them
and
congress
and
this
court
have
continually
stressed
that
they
are
in
favor
of
tribal
self-determination
and
tribal
self-autonomy,
if
we
read
the
icra
in
the
context
of
all
of
these
laws,
it
appears
fairly
obvious
to
me
that
the
full
impact
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
intended.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
48
--
mr.
marcelino
prelo
48,000
acre
and
1,200
members.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
might
point
out
that
approximately
10
percent
of
those
are
living
in
pueblo
now
are
in
the
class
of
that
plaintiff
audrey
martinez
says
it
and
it
never
had
been
asked
to
leave
the
pueblo.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
marcelino
prelo
the
cases
below
have
held
basically
that
equal,
even
handed
application
of
the
law
as
what
should
be
applied,
if
it
is
in
the
indian
context.,
if
it
is
in
the
anglo-american
context
then
they
have
in
fact
applied
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards
and
nothing
could
be
more
indian
context
than
memberships.
the
tenth
circuit
recognized
this,
but
proceeded
to
apply
the
compelling
test.
they
did
not
talk
about
rationale
or
substantially
further
important
governmental
objective,
they
said,
they
have
shown
no
compelling
interest.
i
submit
that
this
court
not
even
in
frontier
and
richardson
or
any
other
case
is
agreed
totally
that
the
compelling
interest
should
be
shown
in
a
gender
type
case.
further,
i
submit
that
the
court
has
retreated
to
some
extent
from
that
holding
and
now
holds
that
they
must
show
substantially
further
important
governmental
objective
that
the
ordinance
would
do
so
and
i
submit
that
nothing
could
be
more
important
than
the
culture
and
the
actual
existence
of
a
tribe
and
that
it
clearly
comes
within
the
standard
in
craig
v.
burton;
however,
the
tenth
circuit
did
apply
the
improper
rule.
we
have
also
asked
the
court
to
consider
treating
this
case
similar
to
immigration
laws
in
the
united
states.
the
tribes
in
the
countries
are
quite
similar
and
the
membership
in
a
tribe
is
similar
to
citizenship
in
a
country.
this
court
in
fiallo
has
taken
the
position
that
they
will
not
interfere
in
that,
that
congress
should
make
those
decision
and
that
the
court
will
not
second
guess
congress.
i
submit
that
that
is
certainly
a
proper
test
to
apply
in
this
particular
case,
when
we
look
at
the
background
concerning
whether
or
not
the
ordinance
is
proper,
we
would
need
to
see
that
the
rule
has
been
uniformly
applied
since
it
was
enacted.
the
undisputed
testimony
was
that
from
a
dr.
allis
who
was
hired
by
the
government
not
by
the
tribe
initially
that
the
culture
would
eventually
break
down
and
be
lost
if
this
ordinance
were
not
allowed.
this
type
of
the
testimony
was
listed
also
from
the
governor
and
other
members
of
the
tribe.
and
i
submit
that
they
feel
very
strongly
that
this
is
true,
because
the
father
is
a
party
that
passes
down
the
custom
and
culture
and
it
is
through
him
that
all
of
his
things
were
talked
to
the
children.
without
this
ordinance
it
is
just
a
question
of
time
before
this
tribe
would
cease
to
exist
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
existed
for
700
plus
years.
the
court
below
found
that
the
tribe
was
patrilocal,
patricultural
indicating
that
everything
descended
through
the
father
and
that
the
ordinance
itself
was
rooted
in
deep
tradition.
to
say
that
the
ordinance
cannot
stand,
would
be
determinate
to
the
very
tribe
that
these
plaintiffs
would
be
members
of
and
that
clearly
they
do
not
want.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
cultural
impact
of
a
non
santa
clara
mother
is
very
minimal
as
compared
to
that
of
the
santa
clara
father.
my
time
has
run
out.
