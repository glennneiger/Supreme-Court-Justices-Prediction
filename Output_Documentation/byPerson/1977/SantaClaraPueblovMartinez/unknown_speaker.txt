unknown
speaker
what
are
whereabouts
in
the
other
northern
part
of
the
city?
unknown
speaker
mr.
prelo,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
reservation
or
whether
the
santa
clara
pueblo
is
an
indian
tribe?
unknown
speaker
interchangeable
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
rather
first
question
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
there
is
in
fact
a
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
that
is
correct,
but
there
might
be
federal
jurisdiction
over
individuals
who
were
not
immune?
unknown
speaker
even
against
the
governor
for
example.
unknown
speaker
everybody
at
least,
all
the
parties
here,
plus
the
amicus
all
seem
to
agree
on
that
--
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
correct,
the
question
is
how
much
lesser?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
elements
beside
persuasion
of
particular
cultures
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
anglo-saxon
adversary
legal
system
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
tradition
of
many
indian
tribes,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
in
so
far
as
sovereign
immunity
goes
that
has
historic
roots
as
much
as
anything
in
the
earlier
years,
the
dealings
of
our
country
with
the
indian
tribes
were
very
similar
to
the
dealings
of
our
country
with
the
government
of
england
or
france?
unknown
speaker
as
separate
nations
and
made
treaties
with
them.
unknown
speaker
and
sovereign
immunity
has
its
historic
roots
in
that
concept
of
what
indian
nations
were
and
the
indian
tribes
were?
unknown
speaker
but
that
regime
was
pretty
well
destroyed,
was
it
not
by
that
1870
or
71
statute?
it
used
to
be
that
treaties
has
to
be
ratified
only
by
the
senate
and
the
house
complained
of
that
fact
in
the
late
60's?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
some
sovereignties,
as
no
longer
that
this
situation.
well,
as
it
works
in
the
concept
to
reflect
in
this
court’s
decision
in
worcester
v.
georgia?
unknown
speaker
which
within
the
last
two
or
three
times
on
opinion
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
marshall
was
given
a
good
deal
of
to
waive
that
that
whole
concept?
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
argument
is
that
the
civil
rights
act
clearly
intended
to
protect
individuals
from
tribal
governments
in
some
respects
--
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
whether
tribal
court
have
any
authority
to
invalidate
a
tribal
ordinance
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
civil
rights
act?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
did
not
ask
you
whether
they
would
or
not.
do
they
have
the
authority
of
invalidating
an
ordinance
or
are
they
just
supposed
to
enforce
an
ordinance
the
way
it
is
written?
unknown
speaker
whether
they
have
the
authority
to
say
that
we
know
what
the
ordinance
says
but
we
refuse
to
enforce
it
because
it
is
invalid.
do
they
have
the
power
of
judicial
review?
and
do
they
have
the
power
to
say
this
ordinance
is
inconsistent
with
the
civil
rights
act
and
therefore
it
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
the
tribal
courts?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
--
unknown
speaker
under
the
tribal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
how
can
they
invalidate
it,
not
repeal
it,
can
they
invalidate?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
governed
by
the
civil
rights
act
only
governed
by
the
civil
rights
act.
they
not
only
have
the
right
but
the
duty
i
would
think,
involve
the
civil
rights
act,
do
not
they?
unknown
speaker
it
is
another
way
of
phrasing
the
question
which
is
supreme
in
an
indian
tribal
court,
federal
statutory
law
or
indian
tribal
law?
unknown
speaker
is
supreme
and
whether
the
conflict
between
that
in
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
if
an
indian
tribal
court
concluded
that
the
federal
civil
right,
indian
civil
rights
act
were
violated
would
not
the
federal
tribal
court
have
a
duty
to
obey
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
my
question
is
wholly
inappropriate
because
i
gathered
from
what
you
said
and
what
now,
i
think
is
in
the
briefs
that
legislative
and
judicial
authority
are
vested
in
the
same
body?
unknown
speaker
in
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
pueblo
council?
unknown
speaker
and
i
presume
the
matter
varies
from
tribe
to
tribe,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
would
you
just
give
me
an
answer
to
rather
practical
problem,
assuming
that
there
is
sovereign
immunity
or
jurisdiction
or
no
implied
cause
of
action
whatever
the
theory
might
be
and
looking
at
the
portions
of
the
statute
other
than
the
criminal
procedural
portions,
provision
such
as
you
can
take
property
without
just
compensation
and
equal
protection,
does
the
statute
have
any
practical
significance
if
there
is
no
federal
remedy?
unknown
speaker
does
the
secretary
of
the
interior
invalidate
this
particular
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
if
he
fairly
violated
the
statues?
unknown
speaker
this
ordinance
has
been
approved
by
the
secretary.
unknown
speaker
but
that
meant
that
it
was
approved
that
means
it
was
approved
if
you
are
correct
before
the
enactment
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act?
unknown
speaker
i
believe
the
governors
--
the
party
defended
here
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
so
even
assuming
that
you
are
right
on
the
jurisdiction
question
as
to
the
tribe,
does
it
make
any
difference
as
long
as
the
relief
that
sought
can
be
intent
against
the
government,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
in
a
dispute
over
whether
the
ordinance
is
consistent
with
the
rights
act,
would
that
not
be
determined
and
if
found
inconsistent
and
invalid
because
inconsistent
with
the
civil
rights
act,
could
that
not
be
appropriate
remedy
just
against
the
governor
without
reference
to
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
why?
unknown
speaker
how
big
is
this
tribe?
of
course
the
answer
of
that
question
may
depend
upon
the
outcome
of
this
lawsuit,
but
approximately
how
big
is
that?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
1,200
men,
women
and
children?
unknown
speaker
so
there
might
be
whatever
it
is,
1,020
instead
of
1,200?
unknown
speaker
1080,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
is
your
point
addressed
to
the
factual
question
of
whether
or
not
these
children
will
kind
of
fit
in
the
santa
clara
pueblo
or
whether
the
federal
district
court
as
opposed
to
the
indian
tribe
should
determine
what
the
traditions
of
the
tribe
are?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
like
a
baptist
telling
the
pope
that
he
is
wrong
about
the
immaculate
conception
in
that
sense,
is
it
not?
presumably
the
best
authority
as
to
the
indian
tribal
standards
or
culture,
is
the
word
of
the
tribe
itself,
if
we
are
simply
talking
about
that?
unknown
speaker
that
i
can
understand
that
congress
has
said,
“tradition
and
culture
will
have
to
be
overwritten
in
some
situations”
but
i
thought
your
point
was
that
here
even
though
the
tribe
says
its
cultural
and
tradition,
it
being
overwritten
the
tribe
is
really
mistaken
because
judge
mitcham
and
judge
doyle
decided
that
it
would
not
be?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
it
is
far
for
me
to
direct
the
order
of
your
argument,
but
i
hope
before
you
sit
down
you
will
address
what
i
consider
to
be
very
important
preliminary
questions
i.e.
whether
or
not
there
was
federal
court
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
if
so
whether
or
not
the
tribe
could
be
sued
because
only
if
the
answer
to
both
of
those
questions
is
yes
to
get
into
any
of
these
issues
that
some
members
of
bench
have
been
discussing?
unknown
speaker
you
do
it
in
your
own
time
and
in
your
own
order,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins
in
251303
of
the
act,
congress
expressly
conferred
habeas
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts,
it
did
not
expressly
confer
any
other
kind
of
jurisdiction.
do
you
not
have
to
meet
the
argument
that
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius.
unknown
speaker
if
as
you
say,
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
tribes,
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
tribal
courts
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
sets
out
paramount
substantive
law
that
the
tribal
courts
must
follow?
unknown
speaker
and
point
out
the
provision
of
these
indian
civil
rights
act
upon
which
you
rely?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
in
any
court
system
that
you
have
reached
the
end
of
the
line
somewhere,
you
will
never
think
you
have
been
wrong
to
come
to
this
court,
that
is
the
end
of
the
line
if
there
were
reviewing
court
for
this
court
it
would
not
be?
but
you
do
agree
that
it
is
not
like
the
court
because
all
i
can
do
is
change
the
rule
--
unknown
speaker
they
cannot
say
that
the
rule
violates
decision
of
outset.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
basically
on
the
structure
of
the
counsel,
of
the
governor
etcetera
that
he
has,
that
the
governor
has
no
more
power
than
he
just
sits
there?
unknown
speaker
what
standard
do
you
think
applies
here
if
there
is
jurisdiction
and
you
reach
the
merits.
do
you
defend
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
what
standard
do
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
tribe’s
judgment?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
judge
for
the
tenth
circuit’s
approach
is
generally
acceptable
of
balancing?
unknown
speaker
well
whatever
it
was?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
get
it
up
anymore
bald
up
than
we
have
and
speak
freely?
unknown
speaker
membership
is
rather
fundamental
question,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purpose
of
applying
the
indian
civil
rights
act
what
is
the
tribe?
what
says
no
indian
tribe
or?
unknown
speaker
and
so,
if
say
a
group
of
indians
wants
to
be
recognized
as
a
tribe?
you
have
to
decide
what
the
tribe
is
in
the
first
place?
and
they
just
say,
here
is
our
tribe,
here
are
our
members
and
they
list
the
various
members?
unknown
speaker
and
for
the
indian
tribe?
unknown
speaker
to
define
itself?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
it
seems
to
me
that
an
indian
tribe
wants
to
be
recognized
it
says
we
want
to
be
a
tribe
and
here
are
our
members,
now
can
you
say
these
in
the
courts
if
the
secretary
accepts
that
and
people
who
are
excluded
from
the
list
complain
can
the
courts
adjudicate
that?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
as
applied
to
this
particular
plaintiff
the
ordinance
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
because
we
have
10,
12
odd
amicus
briefs
from
other
tribes
here,
saying
that
it
is
of
tremendous
importance
to
the
tribe
than
the
particular
question?
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
either
you
or
i,
know
that
with
confidence?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
their
cultural
reasons
are
really
not
very
good
ones
even
if
cultural
reasons
were
relevant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins
have
you
answered
mr.
justice
question?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
does
not
go
into
federal
jurisdiction,
that
goes
to
immunity?
unknown
speaker
my
first
question
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
have
had
jurisdiction
or
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
the
only
jurisdiction
is
expressly
and
explicitly
conferred
by
congress
within
the
meets
and
bounds
of
the
constitution.
there
certainly
was
no
explicit
conferral
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
you
would
agree
with
that.
the
only
explicit
conferral
of
the
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
was
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
so
the
question
is
-
is
there
jurisdiction
implicitly
conferred,
is
that
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
every
federal
court
that
is
passed
on
it
to
date
has
held
that
yes
there
is.
unknown
speaker
that
a
private
civil
remedy,
but
then
you
look
somewhere
for
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
presumably,
would
you
say
the
tribal
governments
in
all
their
branches
including
their
judicial
branch,
i
realize
that
sometimes
that
in
some
tribes,
the
judicial
and
executive
are
one,
but
if
they
are
all
governed
by
this
substantive
federal
law
then
that
is
where
the
remedy
arguably
could
be.
they
are
not
only
there?
unknown
speaker
in
which
that
does
not
necessarily
fall
that
just
because
congress
thought
that
these
substantive
rights
should
be
accorded
--
unknown
speaker
individual
indians
that
necessarily
that
they
be
invoked
in
federal
district
courts
why
could
they
not
be
invoked
to
courts
of
the
indian
tribe?
unknown
speaker
well,
explicitly
why
is
that
in
the
electable
inference
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
on
the
1331
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
indian
civil
rights
act
is
equivalent
to
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
do
not
have
to
decide
whether
you
are
bringing
an
action
whether
this
is
a
statutory
action
or
a
constitutional
action?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
fourth
step
cort
v.
ash
frankly
is
the
one
that
seems
to
me
raises
the
most
difficult
problem
of
whether
the
cause
of
action
is
one
traditionally
relegated
to
state
law
and
now
here
of
course,
traditionally
relegate
the
the
indian
law.
why
does
that
not
defeat
you?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
it
is
correct,
is
that
not
that
the
tribal
membership
matter
they
are
probably
the
classic
example
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
traditionally
relegated
to
the
indians
to
decide
for
themselves?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
include
in
the
statute
itself
a
counterpart
to
section
1983,
that
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins
may
i
ask
one
other
very
brief
question.
you
referred
to
the
exhaustion
of
tribal
remedies,
there
is
no
question
about
that
here.
does
the
record
tell
us
just
what
efforts
your
client
did
make
to
receive
some
kind
of
remedy
from
the
tribe
or
from
the
secretary
of
interior
or
something
like
that?
