justice
john
marshall
the
santa
clara
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
there
a
female
member
of
the
santa
clara
indian
tribe
sued
the
tribe
and
its
governor,
claiming
that
a
tribal
rule
excluding
from
membership,
the
children
of
certain
female
members
violated
the
indian
civil
rights
act
1968.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
cause
of
action
for
the
declaratory
injunction
relief
though
not
expressly
provided
for,
was
implicit
in
the
act,
and
concluded
that
the
membership
rule
was
in
violation
of
its
substantive
provision.
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
the
indian
civil
rights
act
does
not
on
its
face
purport
to
subject
tribes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
in
suits
of
this
nature.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity
preclude
civil
actions
in
federal
district
courts
against
an
indian
tribe
for
alleged
violations
of
the
act.
we
further
conclude
that
the
indian
civil
rights
act
was
not
intended
implicitly
to
authorize
causes
of
actions
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
tribal
officers.
the
structure
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
congress
had
dual
objectives.
one
that
protecting
the
individual
rights
of
tribal
members,
while
at
the
same
time
promoting
tribal
self
government.
implication
of
a
cause
of
action
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
latter
goal.
moreover
congress
consider
and
rejected
various
proposals
for
federal
review
of
tribal
action
in
both
civil
and
criminal
context.
in
light
of
this
history,
congress'
faith
in
authorized
actions,
other
than
habeas
corpus,
indicates
that
it
would
not
have
intended
the
courts
to
infer
additional
remedies.
recognizing
the
anomalous
nature
of
our
relation
with
the
indian
tribes,
and
congress
has
extraordinarily
broad
authority
in
this
area.
we
conclude
that
the
court's
below
erred
in
finding
a
cause
of
action
here.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joins
only
in
part
one,
two,
four
and
five
of
the
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
the
decision
of
this
case.
