on
friday,
april
09,
1971,
the
medical
director
of
stanford
university
hospital
called
upon
the
police
to
remove
a
group
of
demonstrators
who
had
barricaded
themselves
in
stanford
university
hospital.
now,
the
main
action
and
the
press
and
the
police
was
on
the
west
side
of
building.
though
the
demonstrators
had
barricaded
the
doors,
chained
them
shut
and
papered
over
the
glass
panels.
the
police
attempted
to
force
the
doors
and
were
driven
back
by
a
shower
of
heavy
missiles,
several
were
injured.
eventually,
ropes
were
brought,
one
door
was
dragged
partly
open.
the
chains
were
cut
and
the
police
got
in
to
it.
now,
they
tried
at
first
of
course
unsuccessfully
to
persuade
these
people
to
move
peacefully,
to
put
this
fact.
now,
that
was
on
the
west
side;
on
the
east
side
there
were
also
doors.
these
two
have
been
barricaded
and
papered
over
preventing
police
identification.
when
the
police
broke
in
the
west
side
suddenly
the
doors
on
the
east
side
were
opened
and
all
the
demonstrators
erupted
out.
now,
on
the
east
side
there
was
a
squad
of
eight
men,
four
were
facing
to
the
rear
where
there
were
sympathizers
in
the
hall
and
four
were
facing
the
glass
doors.
they
attempted
to
hold
the
battle
on
line
and
were
successful
for
4
or
5
seconds,
but
were
clubbed
to
the
ground.
all
nine
were
injured,
three
survived.
they
could
not
identify
their
attackers.
that
was
on
friday.
now,
the
following
sunday,
a
special
edition
of
the
stanford
daily,
the
student
newspaper
was
published.
that
showed
the
clip,
that
a
photographer
or
one
of
them
of
that
newspaper
had
been
in
a
position
where
he
could
have
seen
and
photographed
the
east
side
and
that
is
what
we
are
concerned.
the
police
went
to
the
district
attorney.
district
attorney
brown
asking
for
a
search
warrant.
brown
had
had
previous
experience
with
this
newspaper.
in
the
1969
rights,
he
had
subpoena
the
editor
and
one
of
the
staff.
the
subpoenas
had
been
unsuccessful,
the
editor
testified
to
the
effect
that
a
few
of
the
photographs
were
available,
the
others
have
been
misplaced
as
stolen.
the
defense
have
had
full
access
to
the
photographs
and
he
had
done
the
best
he
could.
another
staffer
had
the
temerity
to
testify
that
the
photographs
were
dangerous
to
have
around
and
some
had
been
sent
to
tokyo
for
safekeeping.
now,
this
was
the
district
attorney’s
experience
at
that
time.
he
decided
with
the
officer
to
apply
for
a
search
warrant,
a
search
warrant
pursuant
to
california
law
which
specifically
authorizes
the
seizure
of
evidence
from
any
person
or
place,
provided
of
course,
there
is
probable
cause
in
the
rest.
judge
forbes
of
the
palo
alto
municipal
court
issued
the
warrant.
he
authorized
a
search
for
film,
negatives
and
photographs.
the
warrant
was
executed
at
5.30
on
monday
afternoon.
the
officers
asked
for,
but
did
not
get
cooperation
in
producing
the
photographs.
after
waiting
a
few
minutes,
they
searched
the
photo
lab
and
the
main
in
office
which
was
in
some
considerable
disarray.
they
searched
the
desktops,
unlocked
drawers,
filing
tubs
and
i
add,
no
materials
were
read.
as
far
as
possible
they
returned
everything
to
the
place
where
it
was
found.
during
this
search,
the
officers
were
subjected
to
harassing
clients
and
they
were
photographed
many
times.
no
claim
of
confidentiality
was
made
by
any
member
of
the
staff
at
any
time
to
any
person.
the
search
lasted
15
minutes.
nothing
was
seized.
one
month
later,
in
may
1971,
the
stanford
daily
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
affidavits
were
filed.
depositions
were
noted.
but
before
the
depositions
of
the
stanford
daily’s
witnesses
could
be
taken,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
granted
and
declaratory
relief
was
afforded.
this
was
in
1972.
the
district
court
laid
down
two
new
rules;
one,
in
all
third
party
searches
that
is
to
say
searches
of
persons
who
are
not
suspect
of
crime,
in
addition
to
the
historical
requirements
of
particularity
and
specificity
and
probable
cause,
the
affidavit
must
also
contain,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
materials
would
be
destroyed
or
removed.
all
but
otherwise
a
subpoena
was
impractical,
at
once.
there
was
a
special
rule
where
first
amendment
values
are
involved,
this
time
said
the
court
then
must
be
a
clear
showing
that
first,
the
materials
are
important
and
secondly
the
restraining
order
would
be
futile.
in
973,
attorney’s
fees
were
awarded
by
separate
opinion
on
a
private
attorney
general’s
theory.
in
1974,
these
fees
were
set
at
$47,500.
in
1977,
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
the
search
opinion,
but
they
used
the
1976
civil
rights
fees
awards
act,
attorney’s
fees
awards
act
to
authorize
the
grant
of
fees.
and
then
confirmed
the
district
court’s
calculation
of
$47,500.
rehearing
and
suggestions
for
hearing
en
banc
were
denied
and
these
petitions
coming
forth.
those
are
the
facts
of
the
case.
your
honors,
it
is
our
essential
position
that
the
district
court
and
indeed
now
counsel,
did
not
realize
the
extent
of
the
rule
they
fashioned.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
it
is
certainly
true
your
honor,
that
in
the
affidavit
presented
to
the
judge
forbes,
there
was
no
sworn
statement
of
the
impracticality
which
in
fact
attended
to
this
case.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
sir.
may
i
remind
this
court
that
it
reads
as
follows;
negatives
which
can
be
used
to
convict
protesters
will
be
destroyed.
the
daily
feels
no
obligation
to
help
in
the
prosecution
of
the
students
for
crimes
related
to
political
activity.
that
was
the
thought.
now,
in
all
fairness
to
the
date
i
mentioned,
and
and
afterwards
that
policy
was
somewhat
amended.
now,
it
apparently
is
the
standing
policy
as
to
destroy
all
potentially
incriminating,
unpublished
photographic
material.
i
might
add
that
even
on
those,
the
board
was
split
and
as
to
these
particular
events
involving
the
injuries
and
the
damages
caused,
the
board
split
50-50,
50%
it
warranted
and
50
unwarranted.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
it
is
our
hope
that
the
stanford
daily
will
not
set
a
precedent
for
the
remainder
of
the
media,
if
they
do,
destroy
it
immediately,
we
obviously
cannot
get
it,
you
are
quite
right.
but
if
we
were
to
take
the
disarray
of
the
officers
as
indicative
of
the
efficiency
--.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor
it
is
true
the
first
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
in
any
event,
your
honor
they
are
going
to
have
the
day
in
court.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
may
i
distinguish
between
two
situations,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
in
the
one,
it
is
undoubtedly
true.
if
your
honor’s
point
is
that
is
that
not
prior,
full,
adversary
hearing
to
the
taking
of
those
photographs
then
of
course
your
honor
is
correct,
but
may
i
add
this,
it
is
undoubtedly
true,
there
will
be
an
adversary
hearing
on
the
return.
the
question
facing
it
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor
there
are
in
this
case,
considerations
that
would
indicate
a
warrant
should
be
used.
first,
as
the
affidavit
shows,
there
are
staffers
who
have
a
floating
relationship
i
think
it
is
a
fair
characterization
with
the
paper.
now,
as
to
them,
whether
they
are
bound
by
this
or
not,
we
do
not
know.
there
are
the
stringers
and
so
on.
secondly,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this,
that
i
may
say,
i
will
do
'x'
but
efficiency
in
doing
so
is
a
matter
that
may
or
may
not
occur.
it
may
or
may
not.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
i
thoroughly
agree
with
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
would
say
this
that
any
attempt
by
any
court
in
advance
to
exercise
that
kind
of
restraint
over
the
press
should
be
opposed.
we
should
not
do
it.
of
course
not.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
of
course.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you
your
honor.
i
should
refer
to
the
matter
brought
up
by
counsel
which
is
of
course
filing
late
briefs.
as
this
court
knows
the
united
states
filed
a
brief,
late
saturday
we
received
it
sometime
around
6
o’clock
on
sunday
and
then
mr.
falk
with
a
remarkable
intelligence
filed
a
brief
last
night
i
believe,
we
have
received
it
at
about
6
o’clock
last
night.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you
your
honor
that
was
my
request.
your
honor
to
make
some
of
these
points,
we
are
faced
with
an
opinion,
the
opinion
contained
two
rules
we
say
you
must
read
out
that
opinion.
that
is
our
position.
that
is
what
the
police
faced.
that
is
what
we
faced.
that
is
what
law
enforcement
faces,
that
is
what
court
faces,
not
what
mr.
falk
writes
now,
on
that
score
alone,
these
opinions
must
be
reversed
and
let
me
go
further.
the
subpoena
is
not
a
summary
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor
no.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
well,
he
retreats
on
several
grounds.
first
-
the
judgment
below
contains
no
distinction
between
evidence
or
may
i
use
the
discredited
term
mere
evidence
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you
your
honor.
mere
evidence
and
my
authorities
would
not
behead
it
--
and
contraband,
fruits
or
instrumentalities.
now,
we
retreat
from
the
rule
below
and
say
it
should
not
apply
to
instrumentalities,
fruits
or
contraband
at
one
--
second,
the
clear
showing
aspect
and
the
important
material
that
we
retreat
from
that
is
no
longer
required.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
that
drops
out
too.
your
honor
i
do
agree
with
it.
it
is
difficult
to
discover
who
is
on
first
in
this
case.
we
have
now
a
suggestion
that
if
the
warrant
itself
should
it
happen
itself
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
connection
and
these
are
indeed
clergyman
engaged
in
preparing
sermons
for
sunday
morning
use
only,
but
then
and
only
then
does
this
rule
apply.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
precisely.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
well,
your
honor
you
are
best
judge
for
that.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
not
in
so
many
words.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
i
have
only
six
minutes,
i
gladly
agree
with
you.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
three-and-a-half.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
from
the
beginning
your
honor
we
had
severe
doubts
whether
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
and
the
case
cited
by
the
united
states
in
the
brief
of
ashcraft,
of
431
us,
we
have
much
difficulty
in
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
at
the
most
you
have
a
case
involving
a
student
newspaper
yes.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
you
do
not
have
a
damage,
do
not
have
an
injunction.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
my
answer
is
yes,
it
includes
that
plus
what
was
referred
to
as
the
contingent
nature
of
the
services
rendered
for
which
an
extra
$10,000
was
added
off
mr.
w.
eric
collins
of
course
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
that
equity
and
not
having
the
chancellor's
foot,
would
demand
that
we
get
attorney’s
fees
for
the
nothing
down
this
third
party
rule
as
stated
by
the
court.
your
honor,
i
am
told
things
about
california
law
which
frankly
uphold
me.
until
it
is
a
summary
procedure
i
can
get
a
warrant
that
is
not
so.
a
warrant
does
not
issue
to
a
district
attorney
on
the
1539
of
the
california
penal
code
unless
that
is
a
pending
proceeding
with
a
date
set.
it
is
true
that
the
grand
jury
can
get
a
warrant,
but
not
the
district
attorney.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
the
subpoena
thank
you
your
honor.
the
subpoena
cannot
be
a
statement.
now,
that
is
a
fact
on
which
i
can
assure
you
i
am
correct.
the
grand
jury
does
not
sit
as
due
the
federals,
and
i
notice
to
united
states
in
their
briefs
do
not
concede
this
point.
they
bring
to
your
attention
the
fact,
it
will
have
then.
the
grand
jurys
even
do
not
sit
but
once
every
once
every
60
days
in
the
middle
west
or
(inaudible)
or
wherever
they
cited.
i
cannot
remember.
ours
covers
3.8%
of
the
the
total
cases
in
our
state.
your
honors,
this
rule
was
old
conceived
from
the
beginning.
counsel’s
(inaudible)
to
salvage
something
out
of
the
mess
i
say
are
ridiculous.
it
will
put
a
burden
upon
us.
we
will
have
to
show
all
of
these
factors.
we
will
have
to
go
through
this
measures
contemplated
well,
i
might
even
say
meditated
procedure
of
the
law,
before
we
can
get
our
hands,
this
very
hospital
search,
counsel
does
not
tell
you
that
the
patients
said
you
can
have
them
but
the
doctor
thought
he
would
assert
a
privilege.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you,
for
permission
to
file.
