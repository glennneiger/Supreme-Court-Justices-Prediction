mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
chief
zurcher
and
the
four
other
police
petitioners
in
this
matter.
our
contention
is
two
fold.
first
that
no
claim
has
been
stated
or
proven
against
these
officers
under
section
1983,
and
secondly,
that
whether
or
not
such
a
claim
has
been
stated
or
proven.
the
judicial
and
prosecutorial
immunity
should
extend
to
the
court’s
agents
in
carrying
out
lawful
court
orders.
at
the
very
least,
the
special
circumstances
here
make
it
manifestly
unjust
and
unfair
to
award
the
attorney’s
fees
against
these
officers.
first
of
all
even
though
the
respondents
in
this
case
sought
an
injunction
and
were
granted
declaratory
relief,
there
still
is
a
necessity
to
prove
elements
of
tort
in
order
to
hold
them
liable.
any
duty
which
these
petitioners
owed
to
the
respondents
has
been
fully
met,
the
chief
zurcher
did
not
order,
did
not
supervise
and
was
not
even
aware
of
the
acts
complained
of
in
this
suit.
neither
was
district
attorney.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
not,
as
against
chief
zurcher,
justice
rehnquist
he
is
not
the
proper
party
to
this
case.
he
is
not
at
all.
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
yes
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
do
not
believe
under
section
1983
that
there
is
any
such
theory
of
the
respondeat
superior.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
no,
it
is
based
on
the
lack
of
a
cause
of
action
against
my
clients
and
also
on
where
i
believe
should
be
an
extension
under
the
circumstances
here,
of
the
judicial
and
prosecutorial
immunity
because
these
officers
were
acting
as
agents
of
the
court
carrying
out
the
command
of
the
court
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
it
is
my
recollection
that
it
would
be
entitled
to
costs
justice
rehnquist.
however,
we
are
talking
about
a
great
difference
in
degree
here.
the
cost
and
the
suit
of
the
type
you
described
are
substantially
less
and
not
the
type
of
burden,
nor
do
they
carry
with
it
the
stigma
that
can
award
the
attorney’s
fees
against
his
clients.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
think,
when
they
reach
this
type
of
level
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
arise,
i
believe
that
they
are
more
like
damages.
i
would
further
point
out
that
one
of
the
additional
police
officers
should
not
be
held
liable
here
either,
he
furnished
an
affidavit
which
was
the
truth.
no
one
has
contested
that.
and
again
later
on
he
participated
in
the
search,
that
his
acts
violated
no
duty
of
these
respondents
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
am
arguing
that
they
were
improperly
held
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
they
were
held
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
the
case
and
i
think
you
can
do
that
by
finding
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
stated
under
section
1983.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
burger
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
you
can
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is
--
regardless
of
whether
a
cause
of
action
was
stated.
i
think
that
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
would
make
it
unfair
to
penalize
these
petitioners
even
if
they
are
liable
for
the
search
here
with
attorney’s
fees.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
well,
it
arises
out
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
think
the
1976
civil
rights
act
to
amendments.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
did
not
get.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
in
a
sense
i
can
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
here
where
attorney’s
fees
were
awarded
in
1971,
five
years
before
the
act
was
amended
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
with
summary
judgment,
never
an
opportunity
to
present
defenses
like
good
faith,
and
probable
cause
that
it
would
be
unjust
to
apply
attorney’s
fees
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
remainder
of
the
case.
we
would
point
out
that
the
court
acts
only
through
its
agents.
in
this
case
it
is
police
officers
and
that
under
the
circumstances
they
should
be
put
in
the
same
category
here
as
court
clerks,
bailiffs
and
other
agents
of
the
court.
they
did
not
do
anything
improper.
they
got
an
order
of
the
court.
they
served
in
a
proper
and
appropriate
fashion.
they
do
not
have
the
kind
of
facts
that
lead
to
the
aggravated
situations
in
which
all
of
us
would
be
offended.
these
officers
acted
in
a
proper
fashion
as
agents
of
the
court.
in
fact
judge
finkelman(ph)
dismissing
the
municipal
court
judge
from
this
case
found,
“nothing
but
good
faith”
in
discharging
his
judicial
responsibilities
and
the
judge
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
type
of
finding
should
be
extended
in
this
case
to
these
police
officers.
they
acted
in
good
faith
also
carrying
out
the
command
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
in
part,
yes
your
honor,
which
rather
surprises,
the
court
has
so
far
decided
as
available
to
any
defendant
suit
under
1983.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
part
of
it
and
i
think
also
it
was
a
misinterpretation
of
the
applicability
of
1983
and
also
completely
ignoring
the
immunities
which
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
we
have
cases
like
pierson
v.
ray
and
rose
v.
huston.
there
are
several
federal
cases
imbler
v.
packman
which
i
think
should
be
applied
in
the
situation
here
and
we
have
cited
all
of
those.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes,
it
does
your
honor
and
it
also
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
directly
but
there
is
and
it
was
based
on
an
hourly
rate
and
there
is
also
premium
involved,
there
was
--
for
minor,
there
is
a
total
of
about
three
days
in
court
--
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
yes
part
days
your
honor,
and
these
also
a
premium
attached
as
i
recall.
mr.
robert
k.
booth,
jr.
well,
the
trial
judge
recognized
that
perhaps
there
was
value
of
services
in
excess
of
the
amount
attributable
to
hourly
rate,
although
as
i
recall
the
attorneys
for
the
respondent
sought
even
more,
sort
of
a
contingent
nature
type
fee,
in
other
words.
i
think
i
have
made
the
points
i
was
to
make,
thank
you
your
honor.
