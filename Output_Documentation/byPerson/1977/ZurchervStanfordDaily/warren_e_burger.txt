chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1484
zurcher
v.
the
stanford
daily
and
the
related
case.
mr.
collins,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
mr.
collins
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
subpoena
duces
tecum
must
be
sought
first
for
these
other
preliminaries
and
we
decide
against
you
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
would
it
not?
because
there
was
not
any
subpoena
duces
tecum
sought
and
there
was
not
any
allegation
of
the
kind
that
the
district
court
prescribed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
we
have
to
go
on
to
decide
whether
the
public
statements
of
the
stanford
daily
made
previously
that
they
would
not
aid
any
prosecution
or
preserve
any
evidence
or
submit
any
evidence
that
would
help
the
so
called
political
prosecution,
we
would
have
to
then
move
onto
that
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
wish
to
reserve
any
time
for
rebuttal
and
allow
your
colleague
10
minutes
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
would
be
the
time
to
think
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
booth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
how
the
court
arrived
at
this
fee
of
$47,500
say,
days,
hours
of
service
or
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
days
were
they
in
the
court
in
connection
with
this
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
days
in
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
premium,
do
you
mean
punitive,
i
am
not
sure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
falk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
inquiry.
do
you
think
the
process
should
be
any
different
for
the
san
francisco
chronicle
or
the
first
national
bank
of
the
san
francisco?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
if
that
is
there
any
difference
between
a
newspaper
and
anyone
else
on
earth
in
this
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
not
everyone
have
first
amendment
activity
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
your
theory
is
that
if
you
are
using
the
first
amendment
right
more
often
or
more
frequently
than
you
have
some
greater
right
than
a
person
who
uses
it
less
frequently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
still
do
not
know
whether
you
think
a
bank
or
the
san
francisco
chronicle
knows
a
different
kind
of
a
first
amendment
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
were
clergymen
engaged
in
the
first
amendment
business
at
least
every
sunday?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
go
back
to
justice
blackmunâ€™s
question
for
a
moment
in
relation
to
your
last
point,
if
the
subpoena
or
the
search
took
place
in
parsonage
the
files
of
the
minister
including
confidential
memorandum
about
the
emotional
and
marital
troubles
of
his
--
now
many
confidential
things
might
be
equally
there
would
that
not
be
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
clergyman
is
entitled
to
no
less
protection
than
the
san
francisco
chronicle
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
search
before
us
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
chief
of
police
bearing
in
mind
that
we
were
talking
about
not
1978
but
1972,
1971
having
had
that
at
the
trial
come
to
his
attention,
issued
an
order
to
staff
or
prosecutor.
with
respect
to
these
people
who
wrote
that
editorial,
do
not
wait
for
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
a
search
warrant--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
editorial
would
lead
a
reasonable
man
to
believe
that
maybe
a
search
warrant
--
summary
procedure
was
essential
to
get
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
does
not
require
the
recipient
to
turn
the
material
over
to
the
police
officer
who
serves
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
sometime
a
week
or
two
weeks
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
day
but
sometime
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
relation
to
that
editorial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
was
in
good
faith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
collins,
you
have
about
six
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
have
if
you
have
that
mind
the
opportunity
to
submit
a
response
and
comment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
only
three-and-a-half?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three-and-a-half.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
time
has
expired
mr.
collins.

e.
burger
the
case
is
