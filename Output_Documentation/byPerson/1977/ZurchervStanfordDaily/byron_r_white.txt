justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
announcement
i
have
is
--
as
justice
brennan
indicated
is
zurcher
against
stanford
daily
number
76-1484
and
bergna
against
stanford
daily,
number
76-1600.
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
under
traditional
fourth
amendment
law,
the
fourth
amendment
has
permitted
warrants
to
search
property
on
which
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe,
there
is
located
fruits,
instrumentalities,
or
evidence
of
a
crime
regardless
of
who
owns
the
property.
we
are
now
asked
to
reconstrue
the
fourth
amendment
and
to
hold
for
the
first
time
that
when
the
place
to
be
searched
is
occupied
by
a
person
not
then
suspected
of
a
crime,
that
only
in
the
most
unusual
circumstances
should
a
search
warrant
be
issued,
rather
it
is
suggested,
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
should
be
employed.
this
was
the
holding
of
the
district
court
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
decline
to
adopt
this
rather
sweeping
revision
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
accordingly,
have
filed
an
opinion
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
respect.
the
lower
courts
also
held
that
whatever
the
rule
might
be
generally
with
respect
to
third
-
so
called
third-party
searches,
where
the
third-party
isn't
suspected
of
crime,
that
a
search
warrant
should
not
issue,
but
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
should
be
used
when
the
third
party
is
a
newspaper,
that
is
when
the
premises
to
be
searched
is
occupied
by
a
newspaper.
we
also
disagree
with
this
narrower
holding
and
in
our
view,
the
whatever
first
amendment
considerations,
there
might
be
in
a
situation
like
this
can
be
satisfactorily
accommodated
by
a
careful
application
of
the
usual
criteria
governing
the
issue
of
search
warrants.
as
i
say,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined
him.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
mr.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
case.
