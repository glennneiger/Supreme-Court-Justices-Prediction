mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
in
a
somewhat
curious
posture
when
we
receive
petitioners’
opening
briefs.
it
struck
us
that
their
quarrel
on
the
merits
of
this
case
was
with
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
not
so
much
with
us
and
we
had
gone
to
court
to
obtain
protection
against
further
searches
of
a
newspaper.
in
situations
where
subpoena
would
suffice.
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
barely
touch
upon
this
aspect
of
the
case
with
its
first
amendment
overturns
and
aim
their
canons
at
the
district
court’s
opinion
which
they
perceive
to
create
a
rather
broad
per
se
rule
barring
third
party
searches
in
all
cases
of
all
sorts
of
people.
we
dealt
with
those
problems
and
the
practical
law
enforcement
kinds
of
problems
which
they
perceive
to
arise
from
that
opinion
in
our
reply
brief
and
which
we
suggested
that
the
power
of
the
police
to
search
non-press
third
parties
is
at
least
subject
to
the
rule
of
overall
reasonableness
and
that
five
factors
which
we
summarized
on
page
41
of
our
brief
made
this
search
in
this
case
unreasonable
on
these
facts
as
demonstrated
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
can
concede
that
the
district
court’s
opinion
which
this
court
now
has
before
it,
stated
a
broader
rule
than
we
advocate
as
governing
this
case.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
he
must
present
in
light
of
what
has
happened
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
he
must
at
this
time
your
honor
yes.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
the
question
you
asked
me
mr.
justice
rehnquist
goes
to
the
difference
between
the
formulation
of
the
district
court
which
i
concede
is
somewhat
broader
than
ours
and
our
position
is
set
forth
in
part
2
of
our
brief.
what
we
say
is
that
the
subpoena
with
the
government
and
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
calls
that
the
subpoena
first
rule,
what
we
say
is
if
that
applies
where
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
police
to
the
magistrate
affirmatively
shows
that
the
person
is
a
non-suspect.
let
me
just
give
a
couple
of
examples
that
i
think
will
bring
this
into
focus,
beyond
this
case,
plainly
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
that
the
evidence
submitted
to
the
magistrate
in
this
case
showed
that
the
stanford
daily
had
this
evidence
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
neutral
party
gathering
news.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
in
easy
cases
well,
and
it
goes
in
the
other
direction
because
the
possession
of
marijuana
itself
is
a
crime,
no
one
could
be
a
non-suspect,
i
think
in
possession
of
a
quantity
of
marijuana
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
so
and
i
think
further
that
that
may
not
give
sufficient
evidence
for
a
conviction,
but
it
certainly
raises
the
inferences,
if
someone
in
possession
and
control
of
those
premises
has
knowledge
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
there.
i
think
really
that
what
newman
case
was
the
easy
case
is
the
typical
case.
the
typical
case
in
which
evidence
is
sought
from
third
parties
is
a
case
such
as
this
where
evidence
is
in
the
hands
of
somebody,
it
might
be
a
bank,
it
might
be
a
lawyer’s
office,
it
might
be
an
employer.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
if
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
what
we
say
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
he
would
proceed
with
search
warrant
application.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
he
would
get
a
warrant
application,
i
think.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
think
he
is
supposed
to
determine
that.
we
do
not
contend
this.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
contend
only
that
where
it
affirmatively
appears
from
the
material
known
to
the
magistrate
that
the
third
party
is
in
fact
not
involved
in
crime.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
do
not
ask
police
officers
to
display
warrants.
i
take
it
that
it
is
their
obligation
to
enforce
warrants
and
that
is
why
no
damages
were
cited
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
want
counsel
fees
against
the
policeman
to
be
paid
out
the
public
funds
pursuant
to
an
indemnity
statute
in
a
case
in
which
the
transaction
cost
of
litigating
not
anything
relating
to
the
primary
conduct.
the
cost
of
litigating
in
this
matter
and
having
this
matter
determined
has
to
be
borne
by
someone
and
congress
has
said,
where
it
belongs?
i
do
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
did
want
to
start
there
because
i
think
that
is
obvious
case.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
have
said
two
things
in
this
court.
if
i
may
just
to
summarize
them
in
our
statement
more
broadly.
we
say
with
respect
to
the
press,
the
police
must
proceed
by
subpoena,
absent
a
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
an
impractical
situation
such
as
the
risk
of
distraction
and
secondly
we
say
with
respect
to
non-press
searches
that
there
are
cases
in
which
a
search
will
be
unreasonable
and
that
depends
on
an
analysis
of
all
other
facts
and
we
have
indicated
five
factors
in
our
brief
which
made
this
one
unreasonable
even
without
regard
to
the
special
first
amendment
considerations.
none
of
those
factors
would
apply,
i
take
it
where
the
police
are
simply
in
doubt
about
who
the
third
party
is
or
perhaps
have
some
suspicions
that
do
not
rise
to
probable
cause.
our
position,
our
submission
on
that
matter
would
permit
a
third
party
search
in
that
situation.
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
situation
involving
newspaper
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
our
first
point
is
and
our
second
point
is
a
narrower
statement
of
the
case
of
a
ninth
circuit
announced.
i
make
no
apologies
to
that.
i
think
that
some
reflection
of
the
matter
has
suggested
that
--
but
that
is
all
that
is
really
presented
on
this.
one
can
count
your
hypotheticals
on
other
facts
that
involve
problems
that
i
do
not
think
we
are
prepared
to
discuss
intelligently
on
a
hypothetical
basis.
i
think
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
right
ultimately
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
convince
you
of
that
for
this
judgment
to
be
sustained.
this
case
involved
the
newspaper
and
the
interesting
thing
about
the
briefs
in
this
case
is
that
the
parties
almost
pass
in
the
night
on
that
issue.
we
spent
all
of
our
time
discussing
the
facts
of
this
case
in
the
legal
consequences
therefrom
with
the
first
amendment
by
that
is
required
in
cases
where
first
amendment
interests
hang
in
the
balance.
the
solicitor
general,
on
saturday
he
filed
a
brief
to
which
we
filed
a
response
yesterday
in
which
the
government
concedes
that
there
are
no
law
enforcement
interests
that
are
impaired
by
a
rule
requiring
the
police
to
proceed
by
subpoena,
when
seeking
material
from
the
press.
so
we
can
put
that
issue
aside,
no
substantial
law
enforcement
issues
are
presented
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
as
to
that
part
of
the
case
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
now,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
we
do
not
question,
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
branzburg
concerning
the
duty
of
a
press
to
produce
evidence
when
it
is
sought
by
law
enforcement.
no
issue
of
privilege
is
presented
in
this
case.
the
question
is
not
whether
an
evidence
may
be
obtained
from
a
newspaper
but
how
that
evidence
is
to
be
obtained.
it
is
a
question
not
of
substance,
but
of
procedure.
that
distinction
to
my
mind
answers
the
objection
in
the
arguments
of
petitioners
but
we
seek
some
special
privilege
from
the
press
and
we
do
not.
those
cases
such
as
powell
and
the
sacks
on
which
petitioners
relied
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
has
declined
to
give
special
privileges
to
the
press
involve
claims
of
substantive
rights
or
claims
of
substantive
exemptions
from
duties
that
other
citizens
have.
all
of
this
case
involves
is
a
question
of
process,
by
what
process
shall
evidence
be
obtained
from
the
the
press
when
it
is
sought.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
as
i
indicated
we
would
regard
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
part
2
of
our
brief
a
search
of
the
first
national
bank
as
unreasonable
if
the
factors
set
forth
in
our
brief
were
present
that
is
if
there
were
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
first
national
bank
were
involved
in
any
law.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
there
is
one
difference.
it
is
engaged
in
a
first
amendment
activity
and
this
court
had
said
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
everyone
has
first
amendment
rights,
but
not
everyone
is
engaging
as
their
business
activity.
a
bank
has
some
first
amendment
rights
to
be
sure,
but
the
business
of
banking
is
not
a
first
amendment
activity
and
no
first
amendment
interest
of
a
banker
are
impaired
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
our
theory
is
that
if
the
entry
into
your
premises
will
impair
the
exercise
of
your
first
amendment
rights
and
there
is
another
way
to
go
about
the
same
objective
and
to
accomplish
the
same
interest
of
government
the
other
way
the
less
burdensome
means
ought
to
be
pursued.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
my
bottom
line
is
that
they
both
have
the
same
right
to
be
free
of
entry
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
but
the
analysis
has
to
be
different
because
the
first
amendment
requires
a
stricter
scrutiny
of
the
process
than
it
would
be
applicable
to
an
ordinary
business
which
a
bank
is.
so
my
answer
is
that
there
are
different
analysis
that
are
applicable.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
knowing
some
more
facts
than
that.
certainly,
the
kinds
of
first
amendment
injuries
are
less
in
that
situation
because
in
that
situation,
the
individual
is
unlikely
to
have
around
other
materials.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
if
all
of
those
facts
were
before
the
magistrate
i
think
the
answer
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
this
sort
of
a
search
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
great
difficulty
with
that
search
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
analysis
and
i
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
do
what
if
that
were
all
the
facts
that
there
were
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
surely,
yes.
i
think
that
the
difference
may
be
in
the
other
kinds
of
first
amendment
injuries
of
time,
if
i
could
just
turn
to
what
sorts
of
injuries
we
identify
here,
i
think
perhaps
i
can
make
the
point
more
clearly.
when
the
police
entered
into
newsroom
in
execution
of
a
search
warrant,
several
things
happened.
one,
they
cutoff
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
earlier.
they
cutoff
absolutely
the
right
to
address
a
court
on
the
question
of
whether
the
police
have
a
right
to
get
those
particular
documents
that
they
were
seeking,
whether
the
arguments
against
protection
would
arise
from
whatever
rights
are
provided
by
branzburg
or
under
a
state
shield
law.
the
right
to
be
heard
on
that
is
cutoff.
secondly,
the
files
in
records
of
the
newspaper
and
whatever
conferences,
whatever
unpublished
stories,
whatever
drafts
of
editorials
may
be
in
the
premises
all
of
these
are
laid
bare
to
inspection
of
the
police
and
that
does
distinguish
this
kind
of
search
from
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
we
have
been
discussing
in
the
last
few
minutes.
that
kind
of
injury,
that
kind
of
exposure
and
a
needless
one
of
that
causes
a
special
injury
in
the
context
of
a
newspaper
search.
thirdly,
the
entire
newsroom
is
disrupted,
the
precise
amount
of
time
that
this
search
took
is
somewhat
in
dispute
but
it
took
at
least
15
minutes
and
may
have
taken
as
long
as
45,
but
what
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
take
it
that
the
bank
would
be
disrupted
and
i
there
say
that
the
business
of
banking
would
be
as
devastated
as
can
be,
if
the
police
were
executing
search
warrants
on
a
regular
basis
in
the
bank.
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
true
and
i
think
that
under
most
circumstances
an
execution
of
a
search
warrant
in
a
bank
for
this
kind
of
purpose
would
be
unconstitutional
as
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
chaos.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
is
right.
now
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
is
true
and
i
think
that
the
search
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
fear
that
i
may
have
created
the
impression
that
i
think
it
would
be
proper
to
search
the
clergyman.
i
only
mean
to
say
that
in
the
case
where
someone
is
engaged
in
a
first
amendment
activity
then
if
the
clergyman
is
where
that
were
first
amendment
interest
are
at
stake
and
are
impaired
by
a
search
the
case
for
unreasonableness
is
stronger,
but
certainly
there
are
other
situations.
take
the
search
of
the
psychiatric
clinic
at
stanford
which
occurred
in
this
case
and
it
was
performed
by
some
of
the
same
petitioners
and
it
is
in
the
record.
they
searched
the
stanford
psychiatric
clinic
files
because
they
had
subpoenaed
the
medical
records
of
a
patient
and
were
impatient
to
get
them.
there
were
some
concern
that
the
doctor
was
going
to
make
a
motion
to
quash
before
the
subpoena
became
do
and
before
a
motion
to
quash
could
be
brought
on
for
hearing
they
marched
in
armed
with
a
search
warrant
and
searched
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
in
the
record
and
it
got
into
the
record
because
we
moved
for
an
injunction
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
have
done
it
again
and
the
facts
of
that
are
in
the
record
and
it
is
an
example
of
the
kind
of
danger
that
exists
here.
they
marched
right
through
and
they
looked
at
the
files
of
other
patients.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
evidence
that
they
read
them
but
they
had
access
to
them
and
the
other
patients
have
no
assurance
now
of
confidentiality
about
their
own
file.
certainly
the
fact
that
the
other
patient’s
names
are
there.
the
fact
they
were
being
treated
at
the
psychiatric
clinic
is
now
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
there
are
three
opinions
of
the
district
court,
the
one
you
identify
is
the
only
one
on
the
merit.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
there
is
a
judgment,
for
some
reason
when
the
petitioners
cause
the
brief
to
be
prepared.
the
appendix
to
be
prepared
it
was
not
printed
but
it
is
in
the
clerk's
transcript.
there
was
a
judgment
entered
in
about
1974.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
it
is
and
perhaps
before
i
will
advise
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
there
is
a
judgment.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
the
petitioners’
petition.
that
must
be
the
judgment
it
is
i
think
in
exhibit
one
of
the
petitioners
and
it
was
in
1974
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
there
were
extensive
briefs
prepared
in
argument.
i
do
want
to
respond
very
briefly
to
the
suggestion
that
there
is
anything
in
this
record
that
would
support
an
inference
that
the
stanford
daily
would
have
destroyed
evidence
following
receipt
of
a
subpoena.
that
is
an
unfortunate
slur.
it
has
no
support
in
the
record.
the
first
thing
that
ought
to
be
said
about
it
is
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
before
the
magistrate,
absolutely
nothing
at
all
to
support
such
a
contention
in
a
way
of
competent
evidence
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
two
editorials
about
which
i
will
have
more
to
say
in
just
a
moment
were
not
before
the
magistrate
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
they
were.
the
evidence
that
is
in
the
record
consists
of
the
uncontradicted
statements,
sworn
statements
of
some
of
respondents
who
said
that
the
policy
of
the
daily
was
not
to
destroy
any
evidence
that
was
covered
by
a
subpoena.
that
has
never
been
refuted.
there
is
the
brown
affidavit
which
counsel
refers
which
contains
some
hearsay
statements
that
are
conclusionary,
lack
of
proper
foundation,
which
the
district
court
properly
refused
to
consider
but
they
were
never
even
before
the
magistrate
and
that
really
leaves
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that,
would
have
been
shown
to
the
magistrate
and
that
all
of
this
really
is
not
properly
considered
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
it
did
say
that
they
were
irrelevant.
the
district
court
of
course
can
not
control
what
parties
submit
in
the
way
of
affidavit,
so
that
my
answer
is
two
fold,
one,
it
is
irrelevant
and
two
to
the
extent
of
which
to
consider
it
because
it
informs
the
adversary
of
this
case,
the
record
is
uncontradicted,
that
the
daily
was
law
abiding
and
would
not
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
they
had
an
opportunity
to
submit
affidavits
of
their
own,
but
there
was
something
else.
there
were
the
editorials
and
i
think
that
they
far
from
proving
the
point
that
petitioners
would
make
and
then
prove
exactly
the
opposite
and
i
think
justice
marshall’s
question
highlighted
it.
the
editorials
which
counsel
originally,
an
excerpt
which
very
much
distorts
their
meaning.
if
read
in
full
and
they
are
in
the
record
and
i
invite
the
court
to
read
them,
they
are
not
long.
i
invite
the
court
to
read
them,
they
are
pages
117
to
120
of
the
record.
a
careful
statement
with
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
personally
agree
but
it
is
a
measured
and
reasoned
statement.
written
prior
to
branzburg
at
a
time
when
questions
of
journalist
privilege
were
very
much
uncertain.
actually,
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
other
way
from
branzburg.
the
editorials
said
in
effect,
in
an
effort
to
discourage
police
subpoenas
as
we
are
not
going
to
retain
photographs
once
they
have
been
used.
my
wife
has
suggested
to
me
that
this
is
exactly
like
the
sticker
which
were
put
in
cabs
and
buses
on
a
routine
basis,
saying
that
driver
only
carries
$5
in
change,
there's
not
much
point
in
holding
that.
and
that
is
what
these
editorials
both
before
and
after
the
search
said
and
that
is
all
they
said.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
it
is
not
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
could
not
hear.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
the
chief
was
a
defendant
because
he
was
in
charge
of
the
police
department
and
we
alleged
that
he
had
ratified
the
search
and
was
prepared
to
do
it
again
if
the
circumstances
arose
that
was
never
disputed.
the
way
this
issue
came
up
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
after
summary
judgment
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
there
is
indemnity
statute.
he
is
not
stuck
personally.
this
award
is
rendered
against
him
as
official
capacity
which
under
california
law
will
be
payable
out
of
public
funds.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
not
think
we
can
do
that
and
they
were
not
proper
parties
of
course
but
that
is
what
they,
but
they
will
pay
--
actually
it
is
the
county
and
the
city
and
i
would
appreciate
that.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
of
course.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
and
the
statement
has
to
be
understood
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
addressed.
the
reference
was
to
materials
gathered
in
the
course
of
preparing
a
newspaper.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
literally
read,
the
policy
of
the
daily
requires
me
to
give
an
affirmative
answer.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that,
in
an
example
such
as
that,
that
the
policy
would
have
been
carried
out.
it
was
not
addressed
to
a
picture
of
that
kind
or
in
that
context.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
our
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
it
simply
is
a
distinction
that
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
it
is
somewhat
more
serious
crime,
but
the
proposition
concerned
to
which
this
editorial
statement
was
addressed
was
the
concern
that
their
files
would
be
routinely
taken
advantage
of
by
many
people
including
but
not
limited
to
police.
others
have
been
known
this,
other
privately
we
can
say
also
subpoena
in
press.
he
was
attempted
to
have
that
award.
i
think
the
relevant
point
of
this
editorial
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
of
course
is
not
whether
it
is
a
wise
editorial
policy
which
i
understand
many
papers
have,
but
that
is
not
--
the
point
is
that
it
was
not
an
announcement
that
they
would
destroy
evidence
in
the
face
of
a
subpoena.
it
was
quite
the
opposite.
it
was
an
announcement
that
you
should
not
subpoenas
because
we
do
not
intend
to
keep
these
materials
long
enough
for
subpoena
to
be
useful
for,
do
not
subpoenas
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
understand
that
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
understand
that
both
subpoenas
and
search
warrants
are
summary
procedures
in
the
sense
that
both
can
be
obtained
very
quickly,
both
are
obtained
ex
parte
and
both
take
effect
the
moment
that
they
are
served.
now,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
time
advantage
as
to
a
subpoena.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
the
relevant
difference
and
that
is
why
one
hurts
like
the
devil
and
the
other
is
one
that
the
press
can
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
it
requires
them
to
bring
it
in
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
may
be
a
day
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
but
the
policy
of
the
daily
was
to
honor
a
subpoena
and
if
one
was
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
is
in
the
records
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
i
am
sorry
not
in
the
editorial.
i
admit
that
the
editorial
does
not
say
that
but
the
only
evidence
on
the
subject
in
the
record
was
in
the
form
of
affidavit
submitted
after
the
search.
of
course,
the
editorial
was
not
before
the
magistrate
either.
i
think
that
is
the
point.
this
magistrate
issued
this
search
warrant
without
any
reason
and
i
think
counsel
has
conceded
this,
without
any
reason
to
be
concerned
that
the
daily
might
destroy
evidence.
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
before
the
magistrate.
all
the
magistrate
was
told
was
here's
some
evidence
and
we
want
to
go
get
and
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
if
they
will
be
useful
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
i
do
not
say
that
the
magistrate
was
in
bad
faith
or
anything
of
that
nature.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
he
did.
he
said
he
was
in
good
faith
and
we
have
never
contended
otherwise
but
the
point
is
that
on
this
record,
that
is
all
that
was
before
the
magistrate
and
i
think
that
is
all
that
could
ever
have
been
before
the
magistrate
and
almost
any
newspaper
search,
is
that
one
can
imagine.
if
there
ever
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
newspaper
would
destroy
the
evidence
the
rule
of
the
courts
below
would
permit
a
search
warrant
to
issue
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
want
to
stress
that
although
the
conceptional
issues
that
have
been
discussed
this
afternoon
are
fascinating
at
core
of
this
case
are
law
enforcement
problems
that
do
not
exist.
there
are
problems,
i
concede
that
there
are
problems
with
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
at
least
in
california
subpoenas
can
be
made
returnable
on
extraordinarily
short
terms.
the
next
day
if
that
is
appropriate.
secondly,
if
there
is
a
motion
of
some
kind
to
quash
the
subpoena,
there
really
are
only
two
possibilities
that
seems
to
me
-
one
is
that
the
motion
is
not
well
taken
and
surely
courts
are
able
to
deal
with
that
situation
by
summarily
denying
them
if
there
is
a
situation
or
urgency.
if
the
motion
is
well
taken
and
there
is
something
to
be
adjudicated,
that
is
a
very
poor
excuse
for
getting
a
search
warrant
and
overwriting
the
opportunity
to
have
that
heard
in
an
orderly
way.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
grant
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
respectfully
say
that
if
there
is
that
kind
of
a
case
which
ultimately
this
court
found
that
it
appropriate
to
review
and
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
render
that
moot
by
allowing
a
search
warrant,
but
i
may
say
this,
that
if
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
procedural
hurdles
are
too
great
and
the
need
for
speed
is
genuine,
then
i
take
it
that
a
search
warrant
will
be
indicated
because
in
that
situation
a
subpoena
will
be
shown
to
have
been
impractical.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
mr.
chief
justice
thank
you.
