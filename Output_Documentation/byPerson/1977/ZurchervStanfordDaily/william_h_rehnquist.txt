justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
you
concede
that
they
are
entitled
to
costs
that
the
prevailing
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
costs
in
an
injunctive
action
such
as
this
where
you
say
one
of
your
clients
was
not
even
aware
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
someone
is
found
to
be
the
proper
subject
of
an
injunction
because
of
his
participation
in
an
unconstitutional
activity
or
his
failure
to
properly
supervise
employees,
something
of
that
sort,
so
that
an
injunction
issues
although
he
really
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of
acts
for
which
--
on
the
basis
of
the
injunction,
if
an
injunction
issues
against
him
is
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
costs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
then
your
argument
about
it
or
the
impropriety
of
awarding
attorney’s
fees
is
based
on
your
contention
that
the
plaintiffs
should
not
have
prevailed
on
the
merits
against
your
clients?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
judicial
or
prosecutorial
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense
which
might
not
disentitle
the
plaintiffs
to
an
injunction
or
declaratory
judgment
even
though
it
might
disentitle
them
to
damages
and
if
they
were
under
those
circumstances
entitled
to
declaratory
judgment
would
they
also
be
entitled
to
cost
or
not.
assuming
that
they
did
state
a
claim
under
1983
and
should
have
prevailed
under
declaratory
judgment
action,
but
should
not
have
gotten
damages
because
of
the
immunity
defense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
the
problem
we
had
after
edelman
agaisnt
jordan,
the
old
term
preliminaries
case,
and
this
court
had
said
that
you
could
award
cost
against
the
state,
you
cannot
award
damages
against
the
state
and
either
questions,
are
attorney’s
fees
more
like
costs
or
they
more
like
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
are
we
to
determine
or
more
appropriately,
how
is
a
police
officer
to
determine
when
it
is
a
third
party
search
and
when
it
is
a
criminal
suspect
search.
neither
party,
as
i
recall
cites
the
hoffman
against
the
united
states
in
its
brief,
but
there
is
language
in
hoffman
that
says
the
police
are
not
required
to
guess
at
their
payroll,
the
precise
moment
of
which
they
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
suspect
risking
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
if
they
guess
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
are
easy
cases.
supposing
the
affidavit
shows
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
secreted
on
the
premises
of
the
stanford
daily
500
pounds
of
marijuana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
there
is
nothing
in
the
affidavit
that
suggests
there
is
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
any
daily
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
an
individual
had
simply
gone
out
and
taken
pictures
that
the
stanford
daily
took
and
an
effort
was
made
to
get
a
warrant
to
get
his
negatives
because
of
his
thought
that
he
would
probably
burn
them
too.
would
he
be
subject
to
the
same
protections
that
you
say
the
stanford
daily
as
by
virtue
of
the
freedom
of
press?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
were
a
scholar
working
on
a
criticism
of
the
present
administration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
different
than
a
bank’s
operations
being
disrupted,
is
it?
the
first
amendment
does
not
guarantee
where
the
newspaper
operations
physically
in
the
sense
that
they
will
be
subject
to
less
burden
of
law
enforcement
in
that
sense
so
long
as
there
is
no
censorship
connotation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
73
of
your
petition
there
is
a
judgment
filed
july
23,
1974
that
looks
like
--
it
might
be
what
you
would
want
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
question
where
there
was
a
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
district
court
should
not
have
entertained
or
looked
at
any
of
these
affidavits
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
if
the
daily
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
the
defending
parties
in
a
lawsuit
are
not
bound
by
the
affidavits
of
interested
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
until
judge
packham
wrote
his
opinion
that
was
a
perfectly
good
grounds
for
issuing
a
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
real
problems
that
exist
in
the
procedure
you
suggest.
someone
subjected
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
has
usually
several
days
to
respond.
he
can
argue
whether
he
had
custody
of
the
stuff
that
he
was
subpoenaed.
if
the
court
rules
that
he
has
to
produce
it,
he
can
get
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
court
of
appeals.
you
can
delay
it
by
as
much
as
a
year
or
two
years,
if
it
goes
by
the
subpoena
rule
as
compared
to
the
search
warrant
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
a
look
at
how
long
it
took
the
danisio
(ph)
cases
to
proceed
from
the
district
court
in
illinois
through
the
seventh
circuit
through
this
court
and
that
really
was
all
an
argument
about
whether
a
particular
thing
was
subject
to
a
subpoena
or
not?
