mr.
collins
if
they
destroyed
immediately
then
you
can't,
what
are
you
going
to
do
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
think
that
the
duces
tecum
should
do
it
without
a
search
warrant;
should
it
not?
that
would
be
normal
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
there
would
be
motion
to
quash
and
you
could
have
it
up.
everybody
would
have
his
day
in
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
do
not
have
the
day
in
court
if
you
get
an
ex
parte
search
warrant
to
come
in
and
search.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
do
not
need
a
warrant
anyhow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know
of
any
injunction,
or
anything
else
that
can
control
all
the
mankind’s
actions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
all
of
these
points
litigated,
the
responsibility
of
each
person
that
you
were
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
held
to
be
liable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
are
you
arguing
about
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
reverse
that
hold,
do
we
have
to
roll
it
back
to
the
older
stuff
--
?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
am
not
setting
to
separate
the
attorney’s
fees
of
the
finding
i
think
you
have
to
give
both
of
them
that
is
all
i
was
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
separate
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
authority
they
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
statute
is
unfair
statute?
i
mean
i
can't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
me
to
use
the
chancellor's
foot
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
me
to
use
the
chancellor's
foot
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
get
me
more
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
take
position
that
summary
judgment
prevented
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
give
you
an
easy
one.
a
unnamed
co-conspirator,
not
a
policeman,
who
got
to
figure
out
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
would
he
do
with
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
will
go
to
a
real
good
lawyer
and
pay
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
is
given
the
warrant
against
an
unnamed
conspirator,
and
now
is
that
a
third
party
or
not,
is
he
supposed
to
determine
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
the
magistrate,
i
am
talking
about
the
police
here
who
has
handed
the
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
you
want
counsel
fees
against
the
policeman
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
hold
up
the
international
wires
and
any
big
bank
in
the
country
of
15
minutes
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
chaos
plus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
court
on
the
question
of
evidence
what
evidence
was
there
that
linked
the
chief
to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
not
the
chief
one
of
the
defendants,
the
chief
of
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
evidence
was
before
the
court
that
linked
him
to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
,
he
is
now
stuck
with
$47,000?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
you
do
not
make
california
employment?
