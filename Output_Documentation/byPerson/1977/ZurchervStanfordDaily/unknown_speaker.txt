apart
from
any
immunity,
would
they
not
then
have
a
wood
v.
strickland
kind
of
defense?
unknown
speaker
what
should
a
police
officer
do
in
the
ninth
circuit
after
affirmance
of
the
district
court’s
opinion?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
what
should
a
police
officer
do
in
light
of
what
has
happened
in
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
in
any
third
party
search.
he
must
inform
with
the
district
court’s
opinion
which
is
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
were
defending
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court’s
judgments
only
insofar
as
they
applied
to
a
press,
where
the
third
party
is
the
press?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
cover
the
rest
of
the
--
do
you
say
any
third,
you
just
were
arguing
that
you
were
defending
something
more
--
the
need
for
something
more
than
probable
cause
when
any
third
party
is
--?
unknown
speaker
but
does
not
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
were
clergymen
wanting
the
pictures
of
the
preparation
of
a
sermon
the
next
sunday,
in
connection
with
first
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two
about
the
district
court’s
opinion
was
on
october
05,
1972.
is
that
that
the
declaratory
judgment
that
is
appealed
or
what
is
judgment
that
is
being
appealed?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ever
enter
a
declaratory
judgment
or
is
the
opinion
the
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
record
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
i
found
is
the
judgment
of
september
1973
in
which
they
deny
your
motion
for
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
like
you
might
have
lost
and
i
wonder
if
they
applied
for
fees?
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
may
i
ask
you,
who
made
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
do
not
recall?
unknown
speaker
is
that
motion
opposed?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
that
the
policy
of
the
stanford
daily
that
complaint
alleges
that
the
staff
would
consider
itself
free
in
the
absence
of
service
of
a
subpoena
or
other
proper
judicial
process
to
destroy
any
materials
in
its
possession
and
that
the
answer
you
gave
mr.
justice
rehnquist
earlier,
i
take
it
you
would
not
destroy
--
i
think
if
the
question
included
heroin,
you
would
not
destroy
well,
i
will
ask
you
this,
would
you
destroy
evidence
of
a
crime
as
distinguished
from
heroin,
the
possession
of
which
itself
may
be
a
crime?
and
the
statement
contains
no
limitation
as
now
destroy
any
evidence?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
would
not
destroy
evidence
of
that
nature.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
you
had
a
picture
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
for
example,
in
banks
they
take
pictures
regularly
not
only
of
robbery,
but
of
murder
committed
in
a
bank,
and
there
have
been
pictures
taken
of
the
actual
pulling
of
the
trigger
or
the
pointing
of
the
gun
and
pulling
of
the
trigger.
there
is
a
very
famous
one
related
to
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy.
what
would
the
policy
of
the
stanford
daily
be
with
respect
to
that?
would
it
feel
free
to
destroy
it
at
any
time
before
a
subpoena
had
been
served?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sure
you
are
right.
i
was
just
getting
to
the
scope
of
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
pictures
justice
powell
described
and
the
pictures
they
were
thought
to
have?
unknown
speaker
it
is
having
police
officers
instead
of
the
president.
that
is
the
only
difference?
unknown
speaker
he
defends
the
judgments
below
with
respect
to
the
press
completely?
unknown
speaker
he
does
not?
how
is
that?
unknown
speaker
whatever
you
say
in
california
it's
alright.
unknown
speaker
that
drops
out
too?
unknown
speaker
we
have
to
decide
whether
a
judgment
stands
up--
unknown
speaker
he
certainly
defends
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
does
not
suggest
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
unknown
speaker
in
any
kind
of
words
like,
i
mean,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
collins,
just
one
question
if
i
may?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
case
or
controversy
before
us
that
involves
anybody
except
the
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
let
the
very
most,
we
have
a
case
involving
a
newspaper
with
nothing
else?
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
involving
mere
evidence,
and
either
case
involving
contraband
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
absolutely
true.
we
do
not
have
a
damage
claim,
we
do
not
have
an
injunction,
we
do
not
have
--
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
about
the
attorney’s
fees
-
does
their
fee
award
include
the
two
opinions
on
the
issue
of
fees
one,
whether
they
get
them
and
secondly,
how
much
--
does
the
fee
award
include
the
payment
for
the
time
spent
in
getting
the
fees
awarded?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
it
probably
includes
compensation
for
the
argument
about
all
the
non
newspaper
aspects
of
the
case
too?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
subpoena,
do
you
not
think?
