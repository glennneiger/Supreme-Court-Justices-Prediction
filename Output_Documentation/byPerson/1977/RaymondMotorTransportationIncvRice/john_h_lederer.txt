mr.
john
h.
lederer
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
case.
appellants,
raymond
motor
transportation
company
and
consolidated
freightways
are
interstate
general
commodity
carriers
who
utilize
twin
trailer
type
vehicles
in
their
operations.
a
twin
trailer
vehicle
is
a
type
of
truck
that
consist
of
a
truck
tractor
to
the
rear
which
is
attached
to
27
foot
van
riding
on
the
rear
of
the
truck
tractor
on
a
arrangement
called
a
fifth
wheel,
a
turntable
type
arrangement.
to
the
rear
of
this
27
foot
van,
there
is
attached
a
dolly
which
has
a
second
turntable
type
arrangement
on
it
and
a
second
27
foot
van.
twin
trailer
offer
significant
operating
advantages
to
general
commodity
carriers.
because
of
the
ability
to
separate
the
individual
vans
that
make
up
a
twin
trailer
and
make
them
into
new
combinations,
general
commodity
carriers
are
able
to
substitute
the
interchanging
of
vans
for
the
unloading,
sorting
and
reloading
of
cargo
which
is
necessary
when
conventional
55
foot
semi
trailers
are
used.
because
a
twin
trailer
can
be
operated
as
a
single
unit,
that
is
a
single
van
with
a
single
tractor.
twin
trailers
can
be
used
for
downtown
delivery
and
pickups,
where
normally
if
a
general
commodity
carrier
we
are
using
semi-trailer
in
this
operation,
you
would
have
to
unload
the
semi-trailer,
reload
the
cargo
into
a
straight
truck,
a
short
normal
truck
without
a
semi-trailer
to
operate
in
a
downtown
area.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
is
correct,
what
happens
is
the
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir,
these
trucks
are
no
wider
and
would
not
be
significantly
longer
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir,
not
when
they
are
operated
in
a
downtown
city.
the
rear
trailer
of
the
twin
trailer
is
removed,
what
you
have
then
is
a
short
unit.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir,
just
one.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
but
by
being
able
to
use
that
one
unit,
carriers
are
able
to
use
the
same
equipment
that
they
use
for
long
distance
operations
in
a
downtown
city.
they
do
not
have
to
purchase
and
use
a
different
type
of
equipment.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
substantially,
no
--
not
only,
no.
the
general
commodity
carriers
have
terminals.
where
these
units
would
be
broken
down
where
cargo
would
be
loaded
into
them,
unloaded
so
forth,
these
terminal
are
normally
located
quite
near
the
interstate
highways.
in
the
case
of
wisconsin
where
we
have
requested
permission
from
the
state
to
use
the
interstate
highways,
raymond
motor
transportation
has
no
terminals
in
the
state.
made
no
request
other
than
the
interstate
highways
and
consolidate
has
two
terminals,
one
is
located
approximately
one
mile
from
the
interstate
highway
in
milwaukee.
the
other
is
located
approximately
four
miles
from
the
interstate
highway
in
madison.
both
are
down
for
four
lane
divided
highways.
they
requested
the
authority
to
operate
from
the
interstate
to
those
terminals.
but
that
would
be
the
extend
of
their
operations
in
the
state
as
a
65
foot
twin
trailer.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
only
on
specific
interstate
highways
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
plus
the
very
limited
one
mile
and
four
mile
additional
operation
from
the
interstate
highway
to
the
terminal.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
is
correct.
it
is
in
the
case
of
raymond.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
are
approximately
12
states
plus
wisconsin
which
ban
twin
trailers.
all
of
the
states
which
ban
twin
trailers
with
the
exception
of
wisconsin
are
located
on
the
eastern
sea
board.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
is
--
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
map
which
shows
which
states
permit
them
and
which
do
not.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
new
york
permits
twin
trailer
on
the
throughways
in
new
york,
massachusetts
also
permits
them
on
the
turnpikes
in
massachusetts.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
am
familiar
with
that
area,
there
is
not
an
exception.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
is
not.
wisconsin
does
have
a
number
of
exemptions
to
its
general
vehicle
limits.
wide
exemptions,
wide
number,
the
only
exemption
for
twin
trailer
usage
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
a
permit
which
is
granted
to
a
wisconsin
manufacturer
of
these
vehicles.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
is
no
existing
exemption.
the
legal
issues
in
this
case
are
two.
the
first
question
is
whether
wisconsin's
ban
constitutes
an
undo
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
which
cannot
be
justified
by
legitimate
local
purpose.
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
wisconsin's
entire
regulatory
scheme
is
discriminatory.
both
those
questions
in
large
part
depend
on
a
single
factual
issue,
whether
or
not
twin
trailers
are
safe
or
are
unsafe.
if
in
fact
twin
trailers
are
safe
as
a
conventional
semi-trailer
units
which
wisconsin
permits
on
its
highways,
then
there
is
no
legitimate
local
purpose
served
by
the
wisconsin
ban.
if
in
fact,
twin
trailers
are
safe,
then
the
state
cannot
justify
it's
discrimination
against
this
type
of
vehicle
and
against
interstate
commerce
which
uses
this
type
of
vehicle
on
the
basis
of
safety
and
in
our
opinion,
no
criterion
would
exists
that
would
permit
them
to
do
the
discrimination
that
they
do.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
state
was
required
by
the
district
court
in
a
pre-trial
conference
to
amend
its
answer
to
state
in
that
answer
all
justifications
that
the
state
had
for
its
ban
on
twin
trailers.
the
state
responded
that
its
sole
justification
was
safety.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
feel
the
state
is
bound
by
that.
i
think,
there
could
be
other
reasons
that
might
be
imagined,
most
of
those
were
raised
in
this
case
or
at
least
were
considered
for
instance
road
ware.
the
state
conceded
in
its
answer
that
twin
trailers
do
not
cause
increased
road
ware
and
some
irrelevant
after
that
concession
testimony
came
into
the
record
that
they
do
not
increase
road
ware.
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
think
of
other
reasons,
but
i
think
safety
certainly
would
be
the
only
local
purpose
that
would
have
a
substantial
enough
reason
that
it
could
justify
what
is
a
very
great
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
is
a
technical
explanation,
the--
i
suppose
the
short
answer
is
that
there
is
20%
less
splash
and
spray
with
the
twin
trailer
than
with
the
semi-trailer.
the
principle
reason
for
that
is
the
splash
and
spray
which
you
see
coming
at
your
vehicle,
a
large
part
of
it
originates
from
the
tandem
drive
axles
of
a
semi,
there
are
two
axles
that
are
located
quite
close
to
each
other,
the
wheels
are
rotating
and
spraying
water
at
each
other
where
they
hit,
break
up
and
spread
out
in
mist
that
is
common
with
trucks,
that
is
located
both
at
the
tractor
and
at
the
rear
of
the
semi-trailer,
with
the
twin
trailer
there
are
no
tandem
axles.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
is
very
interesting
on
that
particular
point
and
the
district
court
raised
that
point
in
its
discussion
of
safety,
there
is
extensive
testimony
on
the
record
in
fact
of
eleven
vehicle
types
which
were
tested,
in
test,
they
were
under
government
supervision
of
eleven
vehicle
types,
the
twin
trailer
was
the
vehicle
that
put
out
the
least
splash
and
spray,
it
put
out
its
splash
and
spray
in
a
pattern
that
was
lower
and
not
as
wide
as
other
vehicles
and
the
vehicles
that
put
out
the
most
splash
and
spray.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
is
on
the
sides,
that
is
on
the
sides
and
behind.
they
measured
the
density
of
the
splash
and
spray
coming
out
from
the
vehicle
and
from
behind
the
vehicle.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
suppose
in
a
sense
it
could
be
phrased
a
second
guessing
of
the
state.
but
i
don't
think
it
is
truly.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
state
advanced
as
the
sole
reason
for
its
justification
safety.
i
think
certainly
the
burden
then
fell
on
a
appellate,
plaintiff
at
that
time
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
twin
trailers
are
safe.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
we
did
not
persuade
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
applied
a
legal
presumption
from
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
1920s
and
the
1930s
to
the
effect
that
longer
vehicles
or
larger
vehicles,
the
vehicle
size
is
inherently
tied
to
safety.
that
presumption
i
think
is
completely
rebutted
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
it
is
a
difficult
presumption
to
rebutt
because
it
has
the
asemblance
of
reasonableness
to
it.
i
think
people
automatically
assume
that
larger
truck
will
per
se
be
a
less
safe
truck.
the
type
of
trucks
that
we
are
talking
about
here
though
are
a
substantially,
physically
different
piece
of
equipment
than
the
semi-trailer
truck
that
you
are
used
to.
i
say
used
to
because
they
are
the
most
common
trucks
that
you
see
on
the
highways
around
here.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
believe
it
is
at
page
278
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
it
is
not.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
or
if,
it
is
not
the
opinion
of
numerous
experts,
these
were
both
professional
engineers
and
civil
engineers
plus
state
officials
from
the
states
of
minnesota,
kansas
and
other
states
who
had
experience
with
twin
trailers.
uniformly
testified
that
the
additional
length
cause
no
passing
problems
we
are
dealing
with
an
interstate
highway
our
four
lane
divided
highway
where
all
the
traffic
is
going
in
the
same
direction
there
is
no
fear
that
a
car
is
going
to
come
down
in
the
same
lane
in
which
you
are
passing
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
is
true.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
would
be
true
at
the
time
of
trial
when
wisconsin
permitted
55
foot
trucks,
the
difference
in
time
was
two-thirds
of
second
if
you
assume
a
ten
mile
passing--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
at
the
present
time,
wisconsin
has
changed
its
law
now
it
permits
59
foot
trucks
say
you
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
four-tenth
of
a
second.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
it
would
be
approximately
six,
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
these
trucks
are
far
or
less
likely
to
jackknife
than
a
semi-trailer.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
test
show
that,
they
are
quite
conclusive
on
that
respect,
its
one
of
--
quite
a
few
respects
where
these
twin
trailers
are
not
only
as
safe
as
the
conventional
semi-trailer
but
are
substantially
safer.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
you
have
a
situation
where
the
original
statute
of
the
state
passed
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
at
all.
i
think
you
have
two
things.
one
you
have
a
statute
which
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
period
of
time.
the
weight
limits
go
back
long
--
length
limits
go
back
long
before
twin
trailers.
but
you
have
had
a
total
absence
of
domestic
political
pressure
in
the
state
to
make
the
change.
that
is
the
result
of
several
factors.
the
first
of
those
is
the
way
general
commodity
rates
are
set.
they
are
set
on
a
regional
basis.
a
wisconsin
shipper
does
not
pay
a
substantially
higher
rate
because
the
commodity
carrier
has
more
expensive
transportation
into,
out
of
and
through
wisconsin
that
rate
is
set
on
the
basis
of
wisconsin,
illinois,
indiana,
ohio
and
a
number
of
other
states.
so
he
bares
no
direct
cost
burden,
certainly
not
a
substantial
one,
because
of
the
inefficiencies
which
wisconsin
statute
creates
that
is
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
suppose
they
would,
i
think
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
there
is
a
second
factor
there
and
that
is
that
the
type
of
vehicle
which
we
are
talking
about
here,
excuse
me
i
am
sorry,
there
is
a
second
factor
in
why
there
is
no
domestic
political
pressure
and
that
is
because
of
wisconsin's
entire
regulatory
scheme.
it
originally
had
a
statute
which
was
fairly
simple.
over
the
years
every
time
a
domestic
political
group
or
domestic
interest
group,
something
of
importance
to
wisconsin's
economy,
has
had
problems
with
the
length
statute
or
the
width
statute
or
the
weight
statute,
they
have
been
able
to
get
an
exemption.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
there
is.
i
think
it
is
certainly
not
in
the
record,
but
local
carriers
and
wisconsin
presently
operate
with
the
semi-trailer
equipment
to
the
extent
that
a
carrier
outside
of
wisconsin
operates
with
twin
trailer
equipment.
it
is
far
or
less
likely
that
he
is
going
to
attempt
to
expand
its
root
structure
into
wisconsin
and
compete
with
the
local
wisconsin
carrier.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
the
simple
question
here
and
it
is
relatively
a
simple
issue.
there
is
a
substantial
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
dispute
or
serious
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
the
nature
of
that
burden
and
as
to
the
substance
of
it,
it
is
a
severe
burden.
if
it
is
to
be
justified
it
has
to
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
safety
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
very
exhaustive
and
comprehensive
record
which
shows
in
its
entirety,
that
twin
trailers
are
as
safe
or
safer
as
the
conventional
semi-trailers
which
the
state
permits.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
that
question,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
specific
question
about
tyre
pressures,
but
i
think
that
general
question
is
answered
in
the
record.
the
united
states
department
of
transportation
conducted
studies
to
determine
what
the
actual
accident
experience
with
twin
trailers
compared
to
conventional
semi-trailers
was,
they
went
to
a
number
of
commodity
carriers
who
use
both
types
of
equipment
and
survey
their
operations
over
a
five
year
period.
what
the
summary,
the
bottom
line
of
that
i
suppose
was
the
twin
trailer
suffered
approximately
two-thirds
or
three-quarters
of
the
total
number
of
accidents
per
mile
of
operations
that
the
conventional
semi-trailers
did.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
if
he
makes
no
attempt
to
maneuver
the
vehicle
and
no
attempt
to
stop
the
vehicle
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
if
he
is
drunk
and
he
makes
no
stop
or
maneuver,
the
answer
is
yes,
if
he
is
drunk
or
not
drunk--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir.
if
he
is
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
these
vehicles
--
he
does
not
have
twice
as
much
truck
in
terms
of
weight,
he
does
not
have
twice
as
much
truck
in
terms
of
length.
you
are
talking
about
total
difference
in
length
of
10
feet.
this
combination;
65
foot
longer
than
55.
he
has
slightly
more
and
he
has
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir.
he
has
slightly
more
length,
he
has
slightly
more
weight
but
he
has
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no
sir,
i
do
not
--
he
has
a
truck
which
can
maneuver
better
and
can
stop
better.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
the
65
foot
twin
trailer.
the
reason
there
are
about
five
different
reasons,
why
this
is
true.
one
is
because
they
simply
have
better
breaks.
they
have
a
type
of
break
that
uses
as
a
valve
which
is
called
a
fast
air
transmission
valve,
which
results
in
almost
simultaneous
application
of
the
breaks.
it
has
a
better
tyre
foot
print.
there
is
more
because
of
better
axle
loads,
better
weight
distribution.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no,
to
a
55
foot
semi-trailer.
the
type
of
vehicle
which
is
permitted
in
wisconsin
and
every
other
state
in
this
country.
a
65
foot
twin
trailer
compared
to
55
foot
conventional
semi-trailer.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
it
is
prohibited
by
exactly
the
same
administrative
regulation
which
prohibits
a
65
foot
twin
trailer.
that
administrative
regulation
prohibits
twin
trailers
of
any
length.
from
one
foot
to
a
hundred
feet.
wisconsin
by
statute
empowered
the
highway
commission
to
grant
permits
for
twin
trailers
up
to
100
feet
in
length.
a
trailer
trains
is
the
phrase
which
wisconsin
uses.
the
highway
commission
passed
an
administrative
regulation
which
said
it
would
grant
those
permits
only
for
vehicles
used
for
municipal
rough
use
and
only
for
vehicles
in
transit
from
manufacture
to
dealer
or
for
repair.
in
regard
to
the
breaking
of
the
55
foot
semi-trailer
and
the
65
foot
twin
trailer,
those
test
are
in
the
record
and
a
point
of
fact,
those
test
show
that
the
65
foot
twin
trailer
when
more
heavily
laden
then
the
55
foot,
then
a
semi-trailer
type
vehicle;
i
don't
that
it
was
a
55
foot
but
a
semi-trailer
type
vehicle.
the
twin
trailer
was
able
to
stop
in
a
shorter
length
of
road.
that
was
true
both
on
ice
and
snow
and
on
a
dry
pavement.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
exemptions
are
important
and
part
because
of
the
question
which
mr.
justice
white
raised,
which
is
why
there
is
no
domestic
political
pressure
in
wisconsin,
to
permit
this
type
of
vehicle.
wisconsin,
over
the
years,
has
responded
to
its
local
interest
wherever
the
wisconsin
vehicle
limits,
have
constricted
or
restrained
or
created
problems
for
wisconsin
industry,
wisconsin
has
granted
them
a
permit
to
use
a
longer
vehicle.
they
have
--
over
the
years,
this
has
become
--
the
exemptions
almost
swallow
the
rules.
i
believe
in,
over
a
three
year
period,
where
there
was
a
record
in
this
case,
is
still
number
of
exemptions
granted,
wisconsin
granted
over
40,000
exemptions
which
were
general
or
annual
exemptions
that
is
not
a
single
trip
exemption,
but
an
exemption
that
would
apply
to
a
vehicle
for
an
entire
year
and
would
be
unrestricted
as
to
mileage
or
use.
over
a
three
year
period,
there
would
have
been
over
40000
of
those.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
there
are
numerous
types,
probably
one
of
the
largest
usage
is
auto
transporters,
car
carriers.
they
are
permitted
to
run
65
foot
long
trucks
in
wisconsin,
wisconsin
of
course
is
the
home
state
of
american
motors.
we
have
large
general
motors
plant
in
our
state.
there
are
a
variety
of
different
trucks,
which
are
permitted
to
run
in
65
foot
lengths
or
longer
under
the
industrial
inter
plant
permit
section.
this
statute
grants
the
highway
commission,
the
authority
to
give
to
a
wisconsin
manufacturer.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
thats
right
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
you
can.
from
the
plant
to
the
state
line.
not
the
reverse.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
not
for
importation.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
then
presumably
it
cannot
obtain
an
industrial
inter
plant
permit.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
is
right.
assuming
that
we
could
get
an
industrial
inter
plant
permit--
plant
could
export,
we
could
not
deliver,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
in
there
own
equipment,
they
could
only
export,
they
could
not
import.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
to
carry
their
goods
out,
yes.
they
may
always
use
65
foot
trucks
whether
with
general
commodity
carriers.
their
own
hired
carriers
or
whatever,
for
export.
they
cannot
for
import.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
well,
presumably
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
we
could.
in
actuality
we
cannot
gain
a
permit
under
an
industrial
inter
plant
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
it
is
questionable,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
highway
commission
would
grant
it.
the
wisconsin
regulatory
scheme
on
the
scheme
of
exemptions
is
discriminatory.
but,
it
is
not
discriminatory
on
it's
face.
wisconsin
in
general
with
the
exemption
of
the
industry
inter
plant
permits,
that
does
not
make
its
exemptions
applicable
solely
to
wisconsin
industries.
instead
what
wisconsin
has
done,
is
taken
those
industries
important
to
the
state,
whether
it
be
milk
production,
pulp
wood,
automobile
manufacturing,
agricultural
machinery
and
has
granted
to
those
industries
an
exemption.
an
out
of
state
agricultural
machinery
manufacturer
could
use
the
exemption
too.
but
by
tailoring
its
exemptions
to
wisconsin's
needs,
what
has
resulted
is
a
discrimination
affect
and
not
on
the
face.
i
would
appreciate
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart
on
interchanging
these
vehicles,
it
is
true
that
each
of
the
vans
of
a
twin
trailer
can
be
hauled
separately
by
a
twin
trailer
tractor,
but
a
twin
trailer
tractor
is
a
different
piece
of
equipment
than
a
semi
trailer
tractor.
a
twin
trailer
cannot
be
interchanged
with
a
semi
trailer
tractor
and
similarly
a
semi
trailer
van
cannot
be
placed
on
a
twin
trailer
tractor.
thus
wisconsin
by
forcing
use
of
semi
trailers
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
through
the
state
of
wisconsin
interferes
with
interchanging
of
equipment,
because
the
wisconsin
equipment
is
not
compatible
with
the
equipment
used
in
the
other
states.
the
equipment
which
is
the
industry
standard
for
general
commodity
carriers.
i
think
it
is
pertinent
in
this
case
that
the
state
highway
commission
where
the
authors
of
the
administrative
regulation
which
bans
the
twin
trailers
of
any
length
or
prevents
permits
for
being
issued
for
them,
the
chairman
of
the
commission
was
asked
whether
he
had
any
opinion
as
to
the
safety
of
these
vehicles.
he
stated
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
comment
on
that
and
would
choose
not
to
comment
on
it.
no
wisconsin
highway
official
has
testified
that
twin
trailers
are
unsafe.
indeed
the
only
wisconsin
highway
official
who
had
an
opinion
as
to
their
safety,
mr.
james
carn
(ph)
who
was
the
motor
vehicle
commissioner
of
the
state,
testified
that
he
had
reviewed
the
record,
not
the
record
in
this
case,
but
he
had
reviewed
various
reports
and
surveys
in
preparing
to
testify
before
a
public
hearing
and
he
had
concluded
that
twin
trailers
were
safe.
no
one
in
this
entire
record
has
stated
that
twin
trailers
are
unsafe,
no
one.
the
consistent
opinion
of
the
experts,
the
consistent
opinion
of
state
officials
who
had
experience
with
these
vehicles
is
that
they
are
safe.
i
think
this
factor
removes
this
case
from
other
cases.
the
court
is
not
called
upon
the
second
guess
the
state
legislature.
here
the
state
legislature
or
the
highway
commission
more
properly
has
made
a
decision
apparently
on
no
data,
but
it
is
done
as
it
permitted
in
anachronism
to
exist
in
the
state.
they
are
unable
to
justify
the
burden
that
they
have
imposed
on
interstate
commerce
by
anything
other
than
the
supposition
that
it
might
serve
safety
and
that
supposition
has
been
destroyed
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
only
if
there
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
a
presumption
where
it
does
not
matter
what
the
facts
are,
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
vehicle
size
is
tied
to
safety
to
i
think
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
should
prevail
in
this
case
because
that
is
the
sole
thing
that
they
have
going
for
them.
the
presumption
and
the
assumption
which
seems
a
reasonable
one
the
surface
that
larger
vehicles
are
less
safe
vehicles,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
believe
they
can
in
regard
to
the
inter
plant
permits
because
those
permits
apply
not
just
to
the
manufacturer
but
to
the
manufacturer
or
its
carrier,
but
there
is
no
difference
in
the
application
that
i
know
of
to
the
carriers
themselves.
in
other
words,
if
we
were
to
assume
that
american
motors
or
perhaps
as
cardwell
boat
company
which
runs
boats
from
one
side
of
wisconsin
to
the
other,
desired
to
hire
an
out
of
state
manufacturer
or
out
of
state
carrier
to
carry
its
boats,
presumably
it
could,
but
that
would
seem
unlikely
given
the
situation.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is
discrimination
there.
i
think
the
discrimination
that
exist
here
is
the
fact
that
wisconsin
has
exempted
so
many
of
its
own
industries,
those
that
are
of
importance
to
the
state
from
the
regulation
while
continuing
to
apply
the
regulation
to
industries
not
important
to
the
state.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
i
think
we
can.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
do
not
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that
would
be
correct
and
that
would
as
i
suppose
provide
a
basis
for
discrimination
between
interstate
carriers
and
intrastate
carriers
in
the
sense
that
many
of
the
exemptions
that
wisconsin
gives,
it
gives
only
to
operations
within
the
state.
certainly
that
is
true
in
regard
to
the
inter
plant
permits.
i
thank
the
court.
