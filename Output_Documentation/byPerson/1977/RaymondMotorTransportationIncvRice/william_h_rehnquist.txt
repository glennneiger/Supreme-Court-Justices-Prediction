justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
is
the
transition
made?
you
are
not
saying
that
your
65
foot
rear
rig
runs
only
on
the
interstate
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
if
the
extent
of
your
claim
is
to
operate
your
65
foot
rig
as
such
only
on
four
lane
limited
access
highways?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
it
is
more
than
my
question.
when
you
say
the
one
mile
and
the
four
mile,
it
is
not
just
strictly
confined
to
interstate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
recognize
any
considerations
other
than
safety.
how
about
just
aesthetic
ones
that
you
just
do
not
care
to
be
if
you
are
driving
a
car
in
the
midst
of
65
foot
long
trucks.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
feel
its
bound
by
that
at
this
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah
but
even
if
you
are
passing
in
the
left
of
two
lanes
both
go
in
the
same
direction
don't
lots
of
people
prefer
not
to
be
right
along
side
the
vehicle
in
the
other
lane.
you
rather
either
be
behind
him
or
ahead
of
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
to
the
extent
that
you
spent
time
passing
him,
there
is
a
certain
safety
hazard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if,
if
your
car
has
a
blow
off
while
you
are
passing
a
truck,
you
are
in
worse
shape
than
if
you
have
a
blow
off
with
no
other
traffic
around.
don't
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
not
be
much
but
it
is
some
time
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
long
does
it
takes
to
pass
altogether?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
pontiac
is
sending
cars
from
michigan
to
seattle
can
it
get
permit
to
have
one
of
these
kind
of
car
carriers
go
through
wisconsin
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
an
illinois
milk
producer
get
an
exemption
under
the
milk
exemption
to
bring
milk
into
wisconsin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
regulation
on
its
face
does
not
seem
to
prohibit,
doe
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
how
the
highway
commission
whereby
grants
or
permits
has
construed
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
this
exemption
was
created
after
the
case
was
heard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
any
of
the
exemptions
apply
so
as
to
favor
intrastate
common
carriers
over
interstate
common
carriers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
interstate
carrier
could
carry
that
as
well
as
an
intrastate
carrier,
could
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
has
certainly
made
some
distinction,
has
it
not,
between
trains
where
the
train
operates
over
tracks
owned
by
the
railroad
company
and
highways
where
the
trucks
operate
over
highways
owned
by
the
state
in
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
think
that
then
is
the
distinction
between
arizona
v.
southern
pacific
in
barnwell?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lederer
on
discriminatory
aspect
of
your
claim,
do
you
think
that
your
client
as
a
carrier
can
raise
a
claim
of
discrimination
as
between
wisconsin
manufacturers
and
out
of
state
manufacturers,
if
the
treatment
between
interstate
carriers
and
intrastate
carriers
is
even
handed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
contend
there
is
discrimination
as
to
in
manufacturers'
right
to
hire
an
interstate
carrier
as
opposed
to
an
intrastate
carrier
for
that
purpose,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
as
a
carrier
object
to
discrimination
against
an
industry
if
there
is
no
discrimination
between
the
carriers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
