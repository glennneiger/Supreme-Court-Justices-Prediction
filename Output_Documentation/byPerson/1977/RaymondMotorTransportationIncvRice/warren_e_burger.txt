we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-558
raymond
motor
against
rice.
wait
a
few
minutes
mr.
lederer.
i
might
say
in
the
meantime,
if
i
observe
that
both
you
and
your
friend
are
from
madison,
if
you
want
to
get
back
to
madison
tonight,
you
will
have
to
truncate
your
argument
otherwise,
you
will
stay
overnight
and
we
will
finish
with
you
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
may
proceed
lederer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
are
you
asking
us,
the
nine
of
us,
as
you
did
the
three
judges
on
the
district
court
to
second
to
guess
the
state
of
wisconsin
on
all
these
technical
matters.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
let
us
change
it
then,
make
it
work.
reviewing
the
action
of
the
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
did
not
persuade
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
have
been
speaking
of
just
one
aspect
of
the
safety,
what
about
the
problem
of
passing?
it
does
passing
on
the
road,
if
anyone
wants
to
violate
the
law
sufficiently
to
pass
one
of
these
trucks,
introduce
a
greater
element
of
risk,
encountered--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
high
speed
traffic.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
want
us
to
try
to
evaluate
factors
like
that.
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
we
knew
how
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harriman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
has
less
impact
because
it
is
not
as
pervasive
throughout
the
state,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
probably
resume
there
in
the
morning
since
you
gentlemen
decided
you
wanted
to
stay
overnight.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
brennan
is
unavoidably
detained
for
a
short
period,
but
he
will
continue
to
participate
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
records,
the
recording
of
the
oral
argument
and
so
forth.
you
may
continue
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
is
true
that
the
district
court
was
under
a
misapprehension,
what
do
you
think
what
impact
does
that
have
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
can
be
more
tolerant
on
the
safety
factors
with
respect
to
local
industries
than
interstate
haulers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
lederer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-558,

motor
transports
against
wisconsin,
and
the
76-635,
united
states

corporation
against

be
