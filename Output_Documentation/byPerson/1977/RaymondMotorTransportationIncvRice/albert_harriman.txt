mr.
albert
harriman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly
i
am
going
to
get
back
to
the
subject
of
safety.
but,
the
safety
aspect,
is
i
think
obviously
the
one
that
has
chiefly
concerned
wisconsin's
residents.
and
it
is
not
a
scientific
concern
based
upon
lots
and
lots
of
scientific
tests
such
as
we
have
in
this
case.
the
reaction
of
the
general
public,
the
general
driver
who
writes
to
his
legislature
and
says,
i
am
afraid
of
these,
do
not
let
them
into
our
state.
now,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
our
state
highway
commission.
his
testimony
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
he
explained,
that
he
had
been
in
the
legislature
and
he
had
seen
these
letters
and
he
was
aware
of
the
public's
reaction
and
fright
over
them
and
then
as
chairman
of
the
highway
commission,
he
said,
that
out
here
we
do
as
the
legislature
directs
and
we
know
that
the
legislature
has
failed
to
pass
several
laws
allowing
these
longer
trailers,
trucks,
vehicles.
and
consequently,
we
know
what
we
are
expected
to
do
out
here.
and
i
asked
him
from
his
own
experience
and
his
statement
was,
as
i
reflect
upon
the
kinds
of
letters,
i
am
not
reading
all
the
words,
in
the
days
when
i
was
still
in
the
legislature,
there
concern
meaning
the
constituents,
seem
to
center
around
a
commingling
of
vehicles.
that
is
--
well,
i
am
sorry,
i
will
not
interpret.
in
this
case
10
feet
longer
in
the
case
of
trucks
and
the
ability
to
be
able
to
pass
to
such
a
vehicle,
caused
a
great
deal
of
concern
among
the
people
at
that
time.
now,
that
is
the
reason
that
the
law
has
not
been
changed
in
our
state,
the
people
have
told
the
legislatures,
they
do
not
want
it
to
change
and
they
are
afraid
of
these
vehicles.
i
say,
no
one
claims
that
this
is
based
on
any
scientific
studies.
this
is
people
driving
on
the
highway,
worried
about
what
they
see
and
afraid
of
big
trucks.
that
is,
as
i
understand
it.
that
is
the
basis
for,
for
the
fact
that
our
law
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
albert
harriman
they
have
not,
as
far
as
i
know
they
have
not
told
the
legislatures
that.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
do
not
know
if
they
are
aware,
that
there
are,
some
of
the
--
i
mean
generally
aware
that
there
are
some
of
these
other
other
big
trucks.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
that
is
what
i
am
thinking
and
i
will
get
into
this
a
little
further.
one
of
the
principle
uses
of
longer
vehicles
is
made
by
american
motors,
hauling
car
bodies
from
milwaukee
to
their
assembly
plant
at
kenosha.
i
understand
that
its
about
45
miles
and
they
do
haul
lots
and
lots
of
car
bodies
and
they
are
big
long
vehicle.
now,
that
as
far
as
i
know
is
the
only
place
they
haul
these
car
bodies,
just
on
that
one
route,
45
miles
long.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
think
they
are
over
65
feet.
mr.
albert
harriman
yeah,
they
are
fairly
long
i
think
--
as
i
remember
about
--
they
need
not
all
be
the
same,
about
70.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
think
close
to
70,
yes
and
although
the
number
of
miles
per
year,
is
probably,
relatively
high.
the
dispersal
throughout
the
state
--
mr.
albert
harriman
45
mile
run
in
--
its
own
people.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
i
am
sure
they
do.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
yes
then
they
go
out
on
this
vehicle
that
is
displayed
in
the
appendix
of
page
276
and
i
wanted
to
describe
that,
that
is
65
feet
long
and
that
is
a
truck
with
a
super
structure
on
it.
with
a
vehicle
--
and
this
is
the
load
now,
mounted
over
the
cab
and
two
behind
the
cab.
now,
that
is
all
the
truck
part.
then
there
is
a
trailer
and
the
trailer
is
pulled
by
this
truck
and
the
trailer
has
four
cars
on
it
and
for
a
total
--
mr.
albert
harriman
i
believe
it
is
seven,
because
there
are
three
on
the
truck
and
four
on
the
trailer,
the
picture
is
taken
from
a
height,
but
i
believe
you
can
see
down
under
there.
so,
that
by
sticking
one
up
over
the
cab
and
by
obtaining
a
65
foot
length,
they
are
able
to
hold
seven
vehicles.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
you
think
so.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
do
not
feel
too
comfortable
going
by
them
either.
now,
these
long
--
these
particular
car
carriers
are
used
or
available
for
use
by
any
car
carrying
company.
hauling
for
any
manufacturer
to
any
place
in
the
state
all
the
way
through
or
just
part
way
through.
it
is
not
an
exemption
granted
to
locals
or
to
a
local
industry
or
to
benefit
a
local
industry.
it
is
granted
to
benefit
the
whole
automobile
manufacturing
industry
from
detroit,
to
the
consumer
who
buys
the
car
to
drive
and
all
the
people
in
between.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes.
yes,
there
is
no
problem
with
this
particular
type
of
vehicle.
mr.
albert
harriman
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
accurate.
as
i
understand
they
are
65
feet.
mr.
albert
harriman
the
difference
is
that
one
has
a
limited
use
and
it
is
granted
--
obviously
granted
to
assist
the
automobile
industry,
but
not
just
to
wisconsin's
industry
and
they
are
allowed
to
run
throughout
state
and
--
mr.
albert
harriman
i
suspect
that
the
reason
for
pressure,
see
if
you
took
another
--
mr.
albert
harriman
i
do
not
think
a
bigger
lobby
if
you
took
a
ten
feet
off
of
there
you
will
have
to
take
two
cars
off
not
that
those
cars
are
ten
feet
long,
but
you
still
would
not
have
space
enough
left
enough
for
those
two
cars.
now,
why
this
special
exemption
was
given
to
the
automobile
industry,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
any
way
of
telling
how
or
why,
it
was
granted.
but,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
somewhat
different
than
granting
authority
to
run
all
trucks
long
as
many
as
truckers
might
we
wish
to
run
throughout
the
state.
it
is
only
one
kind
of
big
truck
and
it
is
given
to
the
whole
industry
not
just
to
wisconsin
industry
and
i
guess,
that
is
all
about
i
can
say
about
it,
that
particular
type
of
vehicle.
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
the
exemption
granted
from
wisconsin
plant
to
the
to
state
line
there
again,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
was
on
the
mind
of
legislature
to
motivate
that.
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is,
that
our
sister
states
near
by
us
allow
these
longer
vehicles
and
if
we
have
a
manufacturer
and
the
one
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
book
is
a
boat
company
up
near
the
green
bay,
sporting
boats,
small
boats.
they
have
authority
to
operate
a
longer
vehicle
to
haul
these
boats
and
they
have
authority
to
run
in
state
line.
mr.
albert
harriman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
complete
the
argument
on
the
equal
protection
phase
of
this
case
and
get
on
to
the
second
question
which
involves
the
allegations
of
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
addition
to
the
exceptions
discussed
yesterday,
the
appellants'
complaint
of
two
others,
one
is
that
grants
a
longer
load
privileges
to
the
hauling
of
pulpwood,
pulpwood
is
produced
on
wisconsin
farms
and
this
exception
benefits
farmers.
they
also
complained
of
a
twin
trailer
allowance
in
55-foot
lengths
for
hauling
of
milk
from
the
point
of
production
to
the
point
of
first
processing.
this
also
benefits
farmers.
none
of
these
exceptions
which
are
just
mentioned
or
those
we
discussed
yesterday,
favors
intrastate
commerce
at
the
expense
of
interstate
commerce.
none
of
these
isolates
local
industry
from
foreign
competition.
these
are
reasonable
classifications.
they
are
designed
to
promote
a
proper
police
power
public
purpose.
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
do
not
know
quite
how
to
answer
that.
i
think
it
is
designed
to
let
the
wisconsin
farmers
ship
their
milk
to
the
point
of
first
processing.
i
was
not
aware
that
it
would
be
available
for
an
other
state
farmer.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
would
think
not
because
it
is
very
new.
it
happened
really
after
this
case
was
heard.
it
is
very
new.
mr.
albert
harriman
that
is
my
recollection,
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
the
55-foot
limitation
in
the
statute
applies
only
to
two
vehicle
unit,
a
tractor
and
the
trailer.
it
is
limited
to
two
vehicles.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
semi,
as
the
illustration
on
it.
mr.
albert
harriman
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
think
it
has
been
considered
to
be
a
safety
purpose.
the
--
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
suppose
its
history,
the
older
case
can
say
the
whole
thing.
the
sproles
case
arose
out
of
texas.
the
court
said
that
a
state
may
prohibit
trains
if
it
chooses
to.
it
assumed
that
there
in
length
and
in
configuration
of
trains,
and
of
course
i
am
talking
about
railroad
trains,
that
there
was
an
element
of
the
danger.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
did
not
realize
that
it
is
said
that
and
--
mr.
albert
harriman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
albert
harriman
apparently
this
provision
regarding
these
new
trucks,
i
believe
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
district
court.
i
believe
this
is
something
that
occurred
after
the
decision.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
do
not
see
any
impact
on
the
case.
i
do
not
understand
that,
that
was
the
motivation
behind
their
decision.
we
point
out
that
the
police
power
may
be
exercised
to
promote
agriculture
and
industry,
that
it
is
not
an
improper
thing
to
do.
upon
what
is
argued
that
if
you
make
a
special
exception
for
others,
you
must
do
it
for
all
or
at
least
you
may
do
it
for
us,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
this
is
similar
argument
that
if
you
regulate
one
abuse,
you
must
regulate
other
similar
abuses.
this
court
has
rejected
that
analysis
in
sproles
v.
binford.
they
said
the
legislature
does
not
have
to
regulate
all
or
none
and
is
not
bound
to
cover
the
whole
field.
then
in
railway
express
v.
new
york
in
more
recent
case,
equal
protection
does
not
require
that
all
evils
of
the
same
type
be
eradicated
or
none
at
all.
with
the
court's
approval
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
aspect
of
this
case.
we
hope
to
have
a
little
time
to
discuss
that
we
--
mr.
albert
harriman
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
we
do
not
contend
that
it
does
not.
it
obviously
is
a
burden,
but
we
think
that
it
is
a
permissible
one,
but
it
obviously
is
a
burden,
no
question
of
it.
this
court
has
announced
two
different
tests
in
deciding
interstate
commerce
questions.
the
first
one
is
the
rational
basis
test,
announced
in
south
carolina
v.
barnwell
and
which
this
court
applies
to
highway
safety
cases.
it
is
also
announced
another
test
we
call
the
balancing
test,
it
appears
to
have
appeared
first
in
the
long
train
case
in
arizona,
southern
pacific
v.
arizona
and
more
recently
stated
in
pike
v.
bruce
church.
the
rational
basis
test
has
been
applied
in
safety
cases
and
the
balancing
test
in
other
cases.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
balancing
test
should
be
extended
and
applied
to
highway
safety
cases.
the
older
cases
clearly
pointed
out
that
size
and
weight
are
elements
of
safety
and
may
be
taken
into
account
by
legislatures
in
regulating
highways.
the
leading
case
in
1938,
south
carolina
v.
barnwell
said
that
regulation
of
the
use
of
state
highways
is
peculiarly
of
local
concern
and
the
court
has
never
reiterated
from
this
statement.
it
also
said
such
regulations
are
inseparable
from
a
substantial
effect
in
the
interstate
commerce,
and
there
they
announced
the
test,
this
rational
basis
test
whether
the
legislature
in
adopting
the
regulations
has
acted
within
its
province
and
whether
the
means
shows
are
reasonably
adopted
to
the
insight.
they
went
onto
point
out
that
the
state
may
impose
nondiscriminatory
restrictions
as
safety
measures
and
said
the
court
does
not
sit
as
a
legislature
and
that
the
reasonableness
and
wisdom
are
not
for
the
court.
the
court
does
not
substitute
its
judgment
even
where
interstate
commerce
is
involved
and
it
said
the
court
looks
to
see
whether
the
legislative
choice
is
without
rational
basis,
that
is
statement
of
the
rational
basis
test.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
think
comparing
anyone
truck
in
anyone
spot,
at
anyone
time,
i
think
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes.
the
hauling
from
plant
to
plant
that
we
have
like
in
american
motors,
is
a
limited
trip,
we
discussed
it
yesterday,
it
is
45
miles.
these
milk
hauls,
i
do
not
know
just
what
these
milk
hauls
or
where
they
go,
but
they
go
from
the
farm
to
the
plant
where
the
milk
is
hauled,
delivered
for
processing.
pulpwood
is
hauled
usually
from
a
farm
or
field
or
would
somewhere
to
one
of
our
paper
mills
and
of
course
these
car
carriers
run
over
the
state,
and
obviously
their
length
is
as
dangerous
or
non
dangerous,
depending
on
which
side
of
this
case
you
take,
as
perhaps
any
other
vehicle,
but
i
think
it
is
a
justified
police
power
exception
because
automobiles
are
very
long
and
you
can
only
get
a
few
on
a
trailer.
the
extra
10
feet
makes
it
possible
for
them
to
haul
an
extra
two
vehicles
and
of
course
the
state
v.
barnwell
takes
a
position
that
it
is
better
to
have
only
that
many
long
trucks
running
then
to
have
a
much
larger
number
of
long
trucks
running.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
if
it
is
based
upon
a
proper
police
power
purpose,
but
i
do
not
think
that
many
of
these
are
more
tolerant
on
the
locals
than
they
are
on
interstate
haulers.
the
hauling
of
these
automobiles
is
one
and
they
like
shipping
from
milwaukee
to
kenosha
on
this
plant
to
plant,
that
is
something
by
its
very
nature
an
intrastate
commerce.
that
kind
of
a
thing
could
not
be
applied
to
interstate
commerce
by
its
very
nature.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
without
to
and
i
have
realize
you
are
asking
me
for
examples,
without
thinking
of
a
specific
example,
i
would
have
to
say
no.
i
do
not
think
they
apply
in
such
a
way
as
to
discriminate
against
out
of
state
carriage.
mr.
albert
harriman
oh!
i
am
sorry,
haul
for
hire.
i
do
not
understand
that
our
law
discriminates
between
a
for
hire
hauler
and
what
we
call
a
private
carrier.
mr.
albert
harriman
oh!
i
am
sure
that
milk
is
carried
for
hire.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
and
some
of
those
shipments
would
be
interstate
because
they
would
go
from
the
farm
across
the
state
line.
the
--
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
do
not
think
he
can
do
that.
it
would
have
to
fit
it
into
--
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that
the
we
have
a
series
of
statutory,
exemptions.
mr.
albert
harriman
and
you
have
to
fit
into
those
-
mr.
albert
harriman
yes
and
you
would
have
to
fit
into
those
and
if
you
did
not--
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
yes
the
policy
of
the
state
is
to
have
no
trucks
over
55
feet,
but
there
are,
there
are
these
exceptions
--
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
in
do
not
think
unless
their
the
local.
the
hauling
of
automobiles
is
the
best
example
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
local
and
--
mr.
albert
harriman
well
that
one
yeah,
that
by
it
is
very
nature
local,
yes
as
two
plants
were
located
in
the
state.
mr.
albert
harriman
the
evidence
that
the
state
have,
well
we
had
two
witnesses,
that
is
there
are
two
witnesses.
a
man
by
name
of
robertson
testified
as
to
a
study
he
had
made
for,
i
believe
it
is
the
insurance
institute
of
highway
safety,
comparing
collisions
between
vehicles
and
comparing
particularly
larger
vehicles
colliding
with
small
vehicles,
and
counting
the
severity
of
the
damage
in
the
number
of
deaths
and
in
which
vehicle
the
deaths
occurred
and
things
of
that
kind.
that
was
the
evidence
we
have
put
in.
the
other
evidence
was
the
testimony
of
our
highway
commission
chairman
which
i
alluded
to
yesterday.
we
testified
to
the
reasons
behind
wisconsin
attitude
that
he
knew
because
he
had
been
in
the
legislature
and
he
talked
to
--
mr.
albert
harriman
that
pretty
well
summarizes
this.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
do
not
know
if
that
happened.
it
is
the
bigness
that
scares.
mr.
albert
harriman
yeah,
sure.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
yes
that
is
true.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
but
--
mr.
albert
harriman
that
is
true.
mr.
albert
harriman
that
is
true.
the
evidence
if
we
had
it,
would
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
legislators
as
to
why
they
acted
this
way
and
the
best
we
could
do
was
to
offer
mr.
huber's
testimony
who
had
been
there.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
i
agree
with
it,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
applicable
to
highway
safety
cases.
mr.
albert
harriman
well,
in
safety
it
is
looser
pike
said
so.
pike
makes
the
point
of
saying,
but
this
is
not
like
safety
cases
and
referred
to
the
long
train
case.
now,
in
the
long
train
case,
they
were
announcing,
this
court
was
announcing
that
those
restrictions
were
too
much
on
the
burden
on
commerce.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
yes.
in
the
long
train
case
they
did
some
balancing
and
there
they
specifically
said,
we
point
out
--
mr.
albert
harriman
i
am
sorry
pike
was
not
a
non
balancing.
that
is
right
pike
was
a
balancing
standard,
so
was
the
long
train
case
and
in
the
long
train
case,
this
court
specifically
said
that
this
is
very
different
from
the
highway
safety
situation,
so
each
of
these
balancing
cases
has
in
effect
distinguished
the
highway
safety
matters.
in
railway
express
agency
case
this
court
said
that
as
to
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
great
leeway
is
allowed
to
local
authorities,
we
are
talking
about
highways
now,
even
though
the
regulation
materially
interferes
with
interstate
commerce.
i
have
mentioned
the
long
train
case,
and
how
they
distinguish
to
barnwell.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
do
not
recall
that
distinction
being
made
in
the
cases.
the
point
was
that
the
highway
safety
is
more
pertinent
to
state
regulation
than
train
safety.
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
long
train
case.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes.
the
bibb
case
was
one
involving
an
illinois
regulation
regarding
mudflaps
and
it
was
very
restrictive
because
only
illinois
required
it
and
arkansas
prohibited
it
and
other
states
would
accept
either
one.
the
court
there
said
that
if
there
were
only
the
cost
of
this
thing
we
would
not
strike
down
the
law.
we
would
apply
sproles,
barnwell
and
maurer.
they
also
said
the
same
thing
if
we
had
to
resolve
the
safety
issues,
but
they
said
here
the
burden
is
too
great
because
of
this
problem
of
interlining.
interlining
is
the
problem,
is
the
function
of
transferring
trailers
between
carriers.
they
said
here
the
burden
is
too
great
because
of
interlining.
there
is
the
full
crew
law
case
that
we
have
cited
where
the
court
said
they
would
not
attempt
to
balance,
and
then
the
pike
case
where
they
did
develop
this
balancing
test
and
said
that
it
will
be
upheld,
the
statute
would
be
upheld
unless
the
burden
is
clearly
excessive
in
relation
to
the
local
benefits,
but
they
said
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
state
legislation
in
the
field
of
safety
where
the
propriety
of
local
regulation
has
long
been
recognized
and
that
is
when
they
cited
the
long
train
case.
mr.
albert
harriman
i
believe
not.
for
that
proposition
they
cited
just
the
long
train
case.
i
believe
they
did
not
cite
barnwell
and
the
problem
of
interlining
which
was
so
pertinent
in
the
bibb
case,
we
say
is
not
much
of
a
problem
here
in
these
twin
trailers.
we
say
that
the
wisconsin
law
does
not
prevent
interlining.
trailers
can
be
hauled
singly.
this
makes
it
more
expensive,
but
it
does
not
make
the
problem
of
have
to
change
fender
guards.
mr.
albert
harriman
hitched
singly,
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
they
are
interchangeable,
they
are
the
same
unit,
yeah.
we
say
that
bibb
stands
as
an
authority.
mr.
albert
harriman
all
you
have
to
do
just
take
off
the
rear
dolly
and
that
the
rear
trailer
will
fit
on
the,
it
is
called
the
fifth
wheel,
it
is
flat
diskettes
on
the
back
of
a
semi
of
the
truck
or
tractor.
mr.
albert
harriman
yeah,
they
fit.
bibb's
--
mr.
albert
harriman
no,
but
to
hook
up
two
trailers
yes.
mr.
albert
harriman
yes,
there
is
a
dolly.
