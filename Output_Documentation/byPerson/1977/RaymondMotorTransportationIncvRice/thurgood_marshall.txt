something
that
we

of
(ph).
justice
thurgood

mr.
lederer,
getting
you
are
into
a
personal
matter,
when
you
go
down
these
highways
like
with
all
the
rain
we
have
had
last
few
days
and
you
pass
by
a
trailer
truck
with
a
single
one,
you
have
a
pretty
hard
time
at
that
rain
coming
up
off
the
road,
this
just
doubles
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
virginia
passes
a
rule
and
(inaudible)
be
glad
to
think
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
on
the
sides?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
jackknife?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
tests
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
record
also
show
that
on
either
the
single
or
the
double
trailer,
if
you
have
got
two
pounds
of
pressure
wrong
in
one
tyre
by
accident
you
are
going
to
have
something
to
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
know
it
is
true.
they
have
to
keep
those
tyres
absolutely
perfect.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
air,
and
if
you
have
a
careless
driver
with
one
â€“
that
is
one
amount
of
damage
or
lack
of
safety,
but
if
you
got
a
careless
man
with
two,
you
double
the
carelessness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
take
the
one
that
is
absolutely
clear,
but
if
you
have
a
drunken
driver
and
he
has
two,
then
he
could
be
damaging
than
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
is
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
is
drunk
and
he
does
try
to
stop
or
maneuver
he
will
do
twice
as
much
damage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
lost
me
some
place.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
slightly
more
danger.
justice
thurgood
marshall
slightly
more
danger.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right
and
if
he
is
a
drunken
driver
and
he
has
two,
the
first
one
will
reckon,
other
one
would
just
go
on
his
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
thing
wrong
with
that
picture,
comparing
the
two
sizes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
unbelievable
these
are
one's
good
and
one's
bad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
the
question
about
the
automobile
industry
as
compared
to
the
media
industry
or
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
the
bigger
lobby.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
must
get
our
facts
straight
on
the
burden
when
these
trucks
come
through
with
the
two
trailers,
they
have
to
unhook
when
they
hit
the
wisconsin

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
when
they
leave
they
hook
up
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
does
not
interfere
with
interstate
commerce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
local
options
were
denied
or
is
it
not
a
fact
that
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
go
and
say,
i
am
a
local
resident
of
wisconsin
and
i
would
like
an
exception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
there
anything
in
the
record
say
you
cannot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
a
whole
series
of
exceptions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
whole
series
of
exceptions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
trucks

are
large
as
the

excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall

his
testimony

state
big
truck?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
what
they
were
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
the
only
evidence
the
state
put
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
allow
you
to
say
that
the
state
was
interested
in
safety?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
putting
no
evidence
to
contradict
all
these
government
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
putting
no
evidence
to
contradict
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
