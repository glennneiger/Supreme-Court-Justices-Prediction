what
is

on

justice

in
first
of
these
cases,
76-558,
raymond
motor
transport
against
rice,
we
have
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin.
appellants,
two
intrastate
trucking
companies,
challenge
administrative
regulations
of
the
wisconsin
highway
commission
on
the
ground
that
they
unreasonably
burden
intrastate
commerce.
the
regulations
prevent
appellants
from
operating
trucks
that
are
65
feet
long
and
pull
two
trailers
on
four-lane
divided
highways
within
the
state.
neighboring
states
allow
these
trucks
and
trailers.
because
of
the
wisconsin
regulations,
appellants
intrastate
operations
into
and
across
wisconsin
are
disrupted,
costs
are
raised
and
services
slowed.
the
state
defended
the
regulations
on
safety
grounds,
but
it
produced
no
evidence
that
the
regulations
actually
contribute
to
highway
safety.
appellants
on
the
other
hand
produced
substantial
evidence
that
the
longer
trucks
are
as
safe
as
other
trucks
that
the
state
routinely
allows
to
be
operated
on
its
highways.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
a
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
regulations
do
unreasonably
burden
intrastate
commerce.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justices
brennan
and
rehnquist
have
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
