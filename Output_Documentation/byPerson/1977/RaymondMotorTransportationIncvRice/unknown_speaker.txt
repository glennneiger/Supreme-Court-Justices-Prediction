unknown
speaker
it
has
incidentally
--
do
many
states
have
this
bar?
unknown
speaker
i
though
i
have
seen
many
of
rigs
like
this,
on
highways
in
this
area.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lederer
while
you
are
interrupted,
is
there
an
exception
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
from
tomah
(ph)
west
to
la
crosse
into
the
twin
cities?
are
you
--
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
other
impression
from
reading
the
paper
i
must
have
been
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
no
exemption
for
specified
highways
that
you
know
of
specifically
from
tomah
west.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lederer,
are
you
going
to
get
a
little
more
deeply
into
the
exemptions
as
distinguish
the
safety
features
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
categorized,
at
least
under
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
any
plant
in
the
state
can
have
an
inter
plant
exemption?
unknown
speaker
plus,
what
if
you
only
have
one
plan,
can
you
get
an
exemption
to
the
state
line?
unknown
speaker
but
no
one
and
also
for
importation.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
plant
wants
some
raw
materials?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
could
not
consolidate,
you
could
not
deliver
to
a
plant
that
could
in
65
foot
trailers
all
over
the
plant
could
export
in
65
foot
trailers.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
mean,
in
there
own
equipment?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about,
may
the
people
they
hire
to
carry
their
goods
out,
have
65
foot
trailers.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
hauling
for
a
plant
with
a
permit,
you
could
use
65
foot
trailers
to
carry
their
goods
out.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
plant
can.
the
plant
can.
unknown
speaker
are
they
similarly
afraid
of
the
big
trucks
from
wisconsin
plants?
unknown
speaker
it
is
alright
as
long
as
it
is
a
wisconsin
manufacturer.
unknown
speaker
pretty
scary
too.
unknown
speaker
every
time
i
go
pass
one
of
them
i
surely
get
scared.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i
suppose
you
cannot
say
that
with
respect
to
the
exemption
granted
from
the
wisconsin
plant
to
state
line
can
you
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
harriman,
yesterday,
during
the
argument,
mr.
lederer
told
us
that,
as
i
understand
him
at
least
that
no
twin
trailer
combination
of
any
length
could
be
operated
in
your
state
without
a
permit
and
yet
i
notice
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
it
is
stated
that
section
348.08
concerns
vehicle
trains
and
provides
that
except
by
permit,
no
vehicle
shall
draw
more
than
one
other
vehicle
where
the
overall
length
of
the
combination
exceeds
55
feet
which
would
imply
to
me
at
least
that
a
double
trailer
of
55
feet
or
less
could
be
operated?
unknown
speaker
a
semi
so
called.
unknown
speaker
so
that
no
double
trailer
of
any
length
can
be
operated
as
a
general
rule
without
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
safety
purpose
or
a
shorter
than
55-foot
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
i
just
do
not
understand
that
--
unknown
speaker
so
if
what
you
say
is
correct
and
certainly
your
brother
on
the
other
side
agrees
with
you,
the
district
court
really
wrote
its
opinion
under
a
misapprehension,
did
it
not,
when
it
said
that
a
twin
trailer
of
55
feet
or
less
could
be
operated
without
permit?
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
read
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
and
provides
that
except
by
permit
no
vehicle
shall
draw
more
than
one
other
vehicle
where
the
overall
length
of
the
combination
exceeds
55
feet.
in
fact,
your
law
provides
that
twin
trailers
of
any
length
are
prohibited.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
the
district
court
misapprehended
the
law,
the
state
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
harriman,
i
am
frank
to
say
that
i
understood
by
this
long
list
of
exemptions
that
wisconsin
has
do
not
always
exempt
conducts
and
like
create
just
as
much
safety
hazard
on
wisconsin
roads
as
the
nonexempt?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
the
case
that
none
of
the
exemptions
are
the
goods
hauled
by
haul
for
hire?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
know,
but
there
is
any
of
the
milk
carried
for
hire
or
any
of
the
logs
carried
for
hire?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
--
unknown
speaker
you
may
have
covered
this
and
i
missed
it.
did
you
say
you
agreed
or
you
did
not
agree
with
the
standard
expressed
by
the
court
in
the
pike
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
just
in
safety
cases
it
is
a
much
looser
step,
the
rational
--
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes
if
they
have
put
them
aside,
they
may
have
put
them
aside
as
not
judging
them,
but
using
instead
a
different
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
pike
is
not
a
non
balancing
standard?
unknown
speaker
did
not
cite
barnwell,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
physical,
mechanical
fact
can
each
one
of
these
double
trailers
be
hitched
down
to
a
semi
and
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
difference
in
the
coupling
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
has
not
the
rule
then
does
discrimination
against
interstate
carriers.
is
not
that
the
distinction
between
intrastate
commerce
and
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
if
an
interstate
carrier,
if
a
carrier
that
engages
in
interstate
commerce
hires
out
to
do
some
intrastate
commerce,
it
is
still
engaging
in
intrastate
commerce
at
that
time,
does
it?
i
mean
if
you
hired
out
to
carry
to
do
the
inter
plant
carrying
you
would
still
be
an
intrastate
commerce
i
suppose
for
that
purpose?
