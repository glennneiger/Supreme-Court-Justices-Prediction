unknown
speaker
and
did
not
deal
with
first
amendmentfloyd.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
sometime
in
your
argument
summarize
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
why
it
violated
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
somewhere
in
your
argument
will
you
discuss
the
jurisdictional
question
which
you
did
not
cover
in
your
brief
despite
our
rule
that
you
last
--
that
it
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
reason
you
did
not
cover
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
you
knew
it
was
there
when
we
postponed
rather
than
noted
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
willis
what
happens
in
this
case
if
this
will
were
to
be
--or
suppose
it
gave
the
entire
estate
to
these
religious
beneficiaries
and
that
were
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
statue,
what
would
be
happen,
would
the
earlier
wills
be
revived
or
would
the
decision
be
regarded
as
dying
intestate.
unknown
speaker
which
certainly
indicates
how
thin
the
statute's
application
to
this
decedent
is?
unknown
speaker
in
fact
the
statute
is
to
avoid
only
so
much
of
the
will
as
devises
the
bequest
to
the
church
or
clergy,
is
it
not,
it
is
does
not
avoid
the
whole
will
if
there
were
independent
bequest.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
if
--
let
us
assume
that
we
disagreed
--
why
to
we
reach
the
religious
issue.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
disagreed
with
the
lower
court
on
that
it
violates
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
decide
--
the
lower
court
said
that
this
violates
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
the
court
of
appeal
did
not.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
we
agree
with
you
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
the
due
process
then
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
without
talking
about
the
first
amendment
do
we?
unknown
speaker
or
you
have
already
argued
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
idea
how
the
lower
court
views
the
first
amendment
issue.
unknown
speaker
the
federal
state
and
gift
tax
laws
used
to,
i
think
they
do
not
any
more
contain
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
any
gift
made
within
one
year
of
death
was
in
contemplation
of
death
and
that
presumably
would
be
applicable
to
the
ferrari
driver
or
the
football
player,
would
it
not?
and
nobody
else
further
knows
to
protect
the
constitutionality
of
those
provisions.
unknown
speaker
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
then
they
could
come
here
only
by
way
of
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
not
at
all
by
appeal
ever.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
an
usual
posture
for
any
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
it
holds
a
state
act
and
constitutional,
doesn't
the
state
have
the
right
of
appeal
rather
than
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
yeah
and
if
the
federal
constitution
--.
unknown
speaker
the
general
principles
of
a
federal
court
holds
a
federal
statute
united
states
unconstitutional
review
is
by
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
federal
court
holds
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
review
is
by
appeal.
unknown
speaker
my
only
point
is
i
think
you
place
this
court
in
a
position
by
itself
and
it
maybe
your
argument
would
have
to
be
that
is
what
congress
intended.
unknown
speaker
what
is
involved
in
this
case
and
you
argued
to
us
that
you
want
to
cut
down
on
the
number
of
appeals
to
this
case
to
utilize
and
use
an
undue
influence?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
understand
it,
and
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
even
when
the
district
of
columbia,
court
of
appeals
as
in
this
case
declares
a
district
statute,
unconstitutional,
a
statute,
whose
operation
is
confined
to
the
district,
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution.
that
they
are
only
review
here,
in
this
court
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
by
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
urging
on
us
what
that
we
should
treat
this
as
a
petition
for
cert
and
then
deny
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
first
submission
on
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
a
state
code
as
well.
unknown
speaker
we
decided
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
deal
with
it
as
a
state
court
then
if
it
sustained
under
your
approach,
if
it
sustained
a
district
of
columbia
code
provision
against
a
federal
challenge
it
would
come
here
by
appeal.
unknown
speaker
let
us
see
if
i
follow
you,
did
not
the
palmore
say
that
a
d.c.
code
provision
was
not
a
state
statute,
for
purposes
of
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
inquire,
are
you
arguing
that
a
district
of
columbia
statute
is
neither
a
state
statute
nor
a
statute
of
united
states
or
are
you
arguing
that
it
is
a
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
why
do
not
you
argue
that
it
is
neither?
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
as
to
overall
palmore
in
effect
or
say
it
applies
only
to
the
--.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
why
can
not
you
reach
the
same
conclusion
and
what
is
wrong
with
the
argument
that
these
are
a
species
of
legislation
which
are
neither
statutes
of
the
state
or
statutes
of
the
united
states
was
the
meaning
of
that
--.
unknown
speaker
and
then
not
a
statute
of
united
states
by
analogy
to
those
section
in
the
later
chapters,
that
does
not
literary
apply
to
this
case,
this
is
a
different
chapter.
unknown
speaker
only
on
whether
or
not
you
consider
the
federal
question,
a
substantial
question.
unknown
speaker
their
non-appearance
might
reflect
the
conviction
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right?
unknown
speaker
whose
right
are
you
depending
here
the
church's
or
the
testators
involved?
unknown
speaker
and
your
client
is
one
of
the
legatees?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
the
legatees
are
being
unconstitutionally
discriminated
as
against
other
legatees?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
first
amendment
question
whose
rights
that
the
district
court
feel
had
be
entrenched,
the
testators
or
the
churches?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
that
question
or
it
is
---
unknown
speaker
i
just
asked
you,
whose
rights
are
you
going
to
---
unknown
speaker
was
the
testator
a
member
of
the
congregation
or
whatever
is
told
of
your
church?
unknown
speaker
certainly
in
many
cases
that
holds
a
membership
organization
or
association
concert
to
rights
of
its
individual
members
lacp
--
affirming
any
one
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
were
identical?
unknown
speaker
same
legatees.
unknown
speaker
we
just
presumed
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
taxes.
what
was
the
name
of
the
case
in
this
court
involved
in
it
back
in
the
30s,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
you
can
not
remember
anything.
unknown
speaker
now
is
this
an
argument
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
equal
protection.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
all
the
statute
did
was
to
bar
gifts
to
lawyers
made
within
30
days
of
death?
unknown
speaker
or
any
other
identifiable
--
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
singled
out
people
who
have
apt
to
have
access
to
a
testator
in
the
period
immediately
before
it
might
expect
to
die,
doctors,
lawyers,
priest
ministers,
rabbi?
unknown
speaker
and
family
members.
unknown
speaker
well
what
about
the
set
of
cases
that
says,
stick
to
my
lawyer
example,
there
is
a
minor
cases
that
says
a
state
need
not
solve
all
the
problems
at
once,
it
can
take
a
step
at
a
time
and
they
just
stepped
in
to
the
layer,
i
just
took
the
lawyer's
step
in
my
example,
do
you
would
---
you
think
that
would
still
be
invalid?
for
the
same
reason,
if
you
are
arguing
on
---but
at
least
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
difference
between
priest
and
lawyers
in
that
regard
--
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
argument
of
the
possible
promise
of
salvation
provides
justification
for
legislating
of
respective
religious
persons?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
that
is
simply
because
the
first
amendment
argument
or
was
that
also
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
--
we
assumed
to
factually
accurate,
that
there
is
a
greater
risk
of
an
unwise
testamentary
disposition
to
some
in
exchange
for
promise
of
salvation,
you
still
say
it
violates
both---
unknown
speaker
well,
what
part
of
the
first
amendment
do
you
think
that
violates?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
lead
to
an
establishment
of
a
religion?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
would
like
since
we
are
on
the
subject,
you
say
it
violates
both
section
of
the
first
amendment,
how
does
this
particular
statute
lead
to
the
establishment
of
a
religion?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
saying
it
violates
forbid
clause
not
the
establishment?
the
establishments,
with
all
respect
to
you,
brother,
why
it
does
not
say
forbid?
says
affected.
it
says
congress
shall
make
law
respecting
an
establishment
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
there
--.
now
may
be
we
are
in
the
free
exercise
clause?
unknown
speaker
and
what
authority
is
there
for
the
propositions
that
the
chief
justice
has
justice
suggested
to
you,
that
the
free
exercise
clause
confers
the
right
to
unfetteredly
bequeath
money
to
any
church
regardless
of
any
state
regulations?
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest
an
answer
that
the
free
exercise
preserves
the
right
of
a
clergyman
to
persuade
his
member
of
his
congregation
to
give
it
to
the
church.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
go
along
with
that.
unknown
speaker
what
grounds,
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
but
what
--
may
be
that
is
a
slippery
slope?
what
do
you
think
we
should
decide
it
on,
if
we
go
your
way?
