mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
jurisdiction
question.
the
appellees
renew
their
motion
to
dismiss
this
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal
under
title
28
usc
section
1257.
this
motion
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
allows
any
statute
of
the
congress
is
a
statute
of
the
united
states,
congress
did
not
intend
laws
applicable
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
be
statutes
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
this
courts
appeal
jurisdiction
under
section
1257
of
title
28.
we
rely
on
the
case
of
the
american
security
and
trust
company
v.
the
commissioners
and
the
other
case
is
cited
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
also
in
the
brief.
in
the
american
security
case
the
court
had
under
consideration,
the
provisions
or
section
250
of
the
judicial
code
enacted
in
1911
which
provided
that
any
final
judgment
or
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
reexamined
in
cases
in
which
the
construction
of
any
law
of
the
united
states
is
drawn
in
to
question
by
the
defendant.
the
court
in
the
american
security
case
held
that
section
250
of
the
judicial
code
should
not
be
applied
to
purely
local
laws
applicable
only
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
same
phrase
used
in
the
statute
may
have
different
meanings
in
different
connections.
in
other
words
it
is
the
context
in
which
congress
uses
the
phrase
that
is
important
and
it
is
we
say
here
that
the
context
in
the
present
situation,
it
is
unreasonable
to
believe
the
congress
in
cases
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
where
a
statute
is
limited
or
confined
to
the
operation
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
determined
to
be
invalid
is
not
to
be
--
come
to
this
court
by
direct
appeal.
in
palmore
v.
united
states,
the
court
pointed
out
that
jurisdictional
statutes
are
to
be
strictly
construed
in
authorizing
appeals
to
this
court.
that
case
interpreted
certain
provisions
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
court
reformed
a
criminal
procedure
act
of
1917,
that
act
clearly
indicated
that
distinctions
between
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
and
statutes
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
of
jurisdictional
importance.
if
the
new
district
of
columbia
courts
organized
under
article
1
or
to
be
able
to
function
as
purely
local
courts
and
united
states
district
courts
for
the
--
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
was
to
be
able
to
function
as
an
exclusively
article
iii
court
by
section
1702
(c)
of
that
act,
congress
added
section
1363
to
title
28
of
the
code
and
that
section
provides
for
purposes
of
this
chapter
referring
to
district
court
jurisdiction,
references
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
acts
of
congress
do
not
include
laws
applicable
exclusively
to
the
district
of
columbia.
congress
has
recognized
not
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
reform
act
in
1970,
but
generally,
that
enactments
for
the
district
of
columbia
are
separately
distinct
from
those
that
are
applicable
to
the
entire
united
states.
it
is
done
this
by
enacting
two
separate
codes.
the
district
of
columbia
code
specifically
provides
that
it
contains
all
the
general
and
permanent
laws
relating
to
or
enforcing
the
district
of
columbia
except
such
laws
as
are
applicable
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
reason
of
being
laws
of
the
united
states,
latter
laws
of
course
are
--
appear
in
the
united
states
code.
now
in
the
american
security
and
trust
company
case,
the
court
recognized
that
the
jurisdictional
statute,
it
was
interpreting
there
was
passed
to
reduce
the
number
of
deals
to
this
court;
the
position
which
was
contended
for
by
the
appellant
in
that
case
would
have
had
the
effect
of
increasing
the
number
of
appeals
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
from
the
district
court
from
the
district
of
columbia,
yes
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well
at
the
present
time,
the
appeals
may
only
come
here;
cases
may
only
come
here
to
this
court
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
by
certiorari.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
under
1254,
that
it
may
only
come
here
by
certiorari;
certainly
if
a
state
court
holds
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
it
has
no
right
to
come
here.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
if
it
is
the
state
statute.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
stand
corrected
your
honor.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
is
what
my
argument
is
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
court
with
the
same
magnitude
as
united
states,
court
of
appeals.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
did
not
understand
that
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well,
i
was
going
to
get
that,
let
me
add.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
have
not
finished
yet.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
but
to
further
answer
your
question,
if
the
district
of
columbia
code
is
considered
a
state
statute,
the
laws
are
equivalent
to
state
then
the
in
validation
a
state,
in
effect
the
state
law
and
if
it
were
a
state
court,
the
state
court
could
not
come
to
this
court
by
appeal.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well,
it
is
made
applicable
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
would
be
correct
but
if
it
holds
a
statute
unconstitutional,
just
like
if
a
state
court
holds
a
state
statute
on
constitutional
then
there
would
be
no
appeal
to
this
court,
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
did
say
that
sir
but
of
course,
i
am
getting
back
to
my
context
argument
in
that,
in
that
event
there.
it
did
said
that
in
the
question.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
am
arguing
in
effect
that
it
is
a
state
statute.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well,
i
say.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no,
i
say,
as
used
in
palmore,
that
is
correct
but
in
the
context
here
congress,
i
am
saying
never
intended
to
confer
upon
this
court
appeal
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeals
because
while
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
the
highest
court,
it
is
considered
same
as
the
highest
court
of
a
state,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
statutes
enacted
are
also
of
the
highest
court.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well,
of
course
that
is
absolutely
correct
because
there
cannot
be
statutes
of
the
state
because
they
are
not
enacted
by
the
state,
they
are
enacted
by
the
congress.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
we
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
in
creating
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
intent
to
allow
appellate
jurisdiction
to
this
court
under
the
--
every
time
it
holds
a
statute
that
is
in
district
of
columbia
courts
unconstitutional.
to
do
so
would
really
expand
its
jurisdiction.
in
enacting
the
district
of
columbia
court
reform
act
in
1970,
congress
intended
to
have
the
newly
created
art
of
the
one
courts
function
as
local
or
state
courts.
it
intended
the
united
states
district
court
to
function
as
an
article
3
court
and
by
adding
section
13(63)
to
the
us
code,
it
tempted
to
restrict
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
to
acts
having
general
application.
it
would
seem
to
power
that
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
should
be
limited
to
cases
involving
statutes
of
the
united
states
having
general
application
rather
than
acts
of
congress
that
are
confined
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
in
this
context
that
we
urge
the
court
to
deny
jurisdiction.
in
palmore
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
treated
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
it
is
submitted
that
the
court
should
not
follow
that
procedure
in
this
case
because
this
case
presents
neither
a
substantial
federal
question
nor
an
issue
that
needs
further
elucidation
by
way
of
precedent.
the
d.c
statute
here
involved
the
so
called
mortmain
statute
is
unique
in
the
united
states
and
that
it
voids
only
religious
testamentary
gifts.
the
pennsylvania
statutes
in
the
other
so
called
mortmain
statutes
are
not
merely
so
discriminatory.
and
that
they
also
prohibit
gifts
to
other
charitable
organizations.
here,
the
district
of
columbia
stands
to
gain
tax
revenue
by
continued
validity
of
the
statute
because
the
district
of
columbia
court
provides
that
the
bequest
would
escheat
to
the
district
of
columbia
if
the
testator
had
no
living
heirs.
yet
the
district
of
columbia
did
not
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
superior
court.
the
united
state
has
never
entered
an
appearance
in
the
case,
although
each
was
given
notice
under
rule
47,
the
rules
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
is
in
analogous
to
28
usc
section
24(03)
where
you
have
to
notify
the
attorney
general
in
cases
where
there
is
a
constitutional
question
in
order
to
the
statute
being
drawn
in
question.
so
apparently
neither
the
district
of
columbia
nor
the
united
states
consider
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
substantial
else
they
would
be
here
today.
further
there
is
a
bill
now
pending
before
the
city
council
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
repeal
this
particular
statute,
it
is
bill
2-171
introduced
in
june
1,
1977.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
may
well
sir.
passing
to
the
merits
of
the
case
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
court
below
held
the
statute
invalid
as
establishing
classifications
that
have
no
rational
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
and
thus
deny
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
would
say
both
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
place
their
decision
of
the
rights
of
the
legatees,
churches.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
your
honor,
well
i
represent
the
calvary
baptist
church.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
both,
my
best
recollection
your
honor
what
has
been
----
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
i
thought
if
i
had
time---
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
that
as
far
as
first
amendments
rights
are
concerned
it
violated
both.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
he
was
a
member
of
the
congregation.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
before
getting
in
to
the
merits
perhaps
i
should
restate
the
facts
or
bring
out
some
additional
facts.
the
bequest
that
was
made
by
mrs.
french
left
a
number
of
bequest
and
in
addition
it
left
her
residuary
to
three
persons,
one
third
john
hopkins
university
which
is
not
involved
here
that
bequest,
(inaudible)
should
be
paid
and
then
one
bequest
to
the
calvary
baptist
church,
of
one
third
of
residuary
and
one
third
to
st.
matthew's
cathedral.
mrs.
french
was
a
member
of
a
the
calvary
baptist
church,
her
husband
a
physician,
who
predeceased
her
was
a
member
of
the
catholic
fate.
it
was
stipulated
in
the
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
appellees
had
made
any
attempt
to
influence
her
choice
of
legatees.
in
addition,
this
bequest
in
this
case
involves
only
personal
property.
it
does
not
involve
any
real
property.
the
heirs
at
law
here
are
collaterals
are
brother
and
nieces
and
nephews.
i
am
getting
back
to
my
argument
on
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
relies
on
the
legislative
history
and
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
preclude
bequest,
gifts
to
clergymen
and
to
religious
organizations
by
persons
who
might
be
unduly
influenced
by
religious
considerations.
it
pointed
out
that
the
statute
voids
only
bequest
and
devises
for
the
benefit
of
religious
institutions
or
the
clergy.
testamentary
bequest
to
charitable
organizations
are
not
included
in
the
dc
statute.
further
the
statute
is
interpreted
by
the
district
of
columbia
courts
and
i
believe
this
court
will
power
the
interpretations
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
distinguishes
between
bequest
to
religious
institutions
and
bequest
to
charitable
institutions
owned
and
operated
by
religious
institutions.
the
statute
only
validates
bequest
to
religious
organizations
and
for
the
religious
purposes
and
to
the
clergy.
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
presuming
that
a
testator
troubled
by
religious
convictions
is
likely
to
make
a
bequest
directly
to
a
church
rather
than
to
a
charity
run
by
the
church,
the
statute
thus
treats
similarly
situated
legatees
entirely
different.
they
further
pointed
out
that
there
were
others,
such
as
lawyers,
doctors,
nurses
and
charities
who
are
in
an
equal
position
with
to
influence
a
testator,
yet
the
statute
never
covers
them
and
the
same
lean
out
of
religion
where
there
is
no
grounds
or
difference
is
irrational.
as
i
stated
before
this
statute
operates
if
the
testator
has
no
family
or
heirs
and
this
if
it
does
had
no
family
heirs,
the
bequest
is
automatically
void
and
escheats
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
stated
that
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
had
used
the
doctrine
of
dependent
relative
revocation
in
other
cases
to
avoid
the
statute
and
this
is
true,
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
used
in
this
case.
the
reason
was
not
used
in
this
case,
and
we
never
got
to
it.
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
other
but
in
the
record
it
shows
that
the
gifts
that
mrs.
french
made
to
--
by
a
former
wills
to
the
charitable
organizations.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no
they
were
not
identical
but
they
did
include---
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
these
legatees
and
regarding
the
tax
law
irrebuttable
presumption,
even
though
if
they
had
presumption
for
tax
purposes
they
never
avoided
the
gift,
the
gift
remained.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
am
sorry,
just
forgot
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
was
suggested
also
by
council
that
the
testator
could
have
avoided
this
problem
by
making
inter
vivos
gifts.
well
that
argument
i
think
conflicts
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
rational
of
decision
in
trimble
v.
gordon
where
that
is
not
the
issue,
if
she
had
done
that
then
we
would
not
have
the
issue
here.
in
his
argument
and
his
brief,
it
is
the
appellant
state
that
is
questionable
whether
the
statute
makes
the
classification
at
all
and
thus
whether
the
equal
concept
of
laws
applies.
it
is
argued
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
district
relating
to
testamentary
dispositions,
the
appellees
recognized
that
a
state
can
legislate
to
regulate
both
testate
and
intestate
succession.
however
when
the
state
does
so
legislate,
it
can
not
do
so
in
a
discriminatory
matter
and
it
is
here,
its
laws
must
be
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
equal
protection
and
the
statute
here
singles
out
gifts
to
religious
institutions
for
religious
purposes
and
to
the
clergy
in
a
discriminatory
matter.
the
appellant
state
that
the
statute
does
not
regulate
a
fundamental
interest
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
therefore
that
there
is
no
need
to
show
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
needs
little
or
no
argument
to
show
that
the
free
exercise
of
one's
religion
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
classification
affects
fundamental
rights,
since
it
concluded
that
the
discriminatory
treatment
set
forth
in
the
statute
could
not
withstand
the
rational
basis
test.
however,
the
trial
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
classification
made
by
the
statute.
the
statute
singles
out
religious
organizations
for
religious
purposes
alone
and
precludes
the
right
of
the
beneficiaries
to
receive
the
bequest.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no
this
is
still
under
the
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
believe,
so
yes,
if
it
singled
out
just
lawyers,
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
any
other
single
person,
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
if
it
was
broad
and
just
not
just
singling
out
religion
and
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
you
are
directly
involving
the
first
amendment
in
that
instance
and
i
think
it
is
suspected
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well
i
think
they
would
overlap
sir,
but
it
is
a
first
amendment
argument
primarily.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
i
think
it
violates
both
because
it
discriminates.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
we
think
it
violates
both,
however
the
court---
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
if
i
can
get
over,
do
you
want
me
to
get
out
of
the
fourth
the
---
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well
the
establishment
clause
says
that
the
(inaudible)
law
which
establishes
or
forbids
a
religion.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
we
are
in
both
and
---
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
below
in
the
trial
court
held
that
it
violated
the
free
exercise
provision
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
was
of
course,
the
direct
opinion
of
the
concurring
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
placed
it
on
that
very
right.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well
i
think
it
is
easier
to
justify
it
on
other
grounds
but
i
agree
with
it
but
i
think
it
is
just
easier
to
justify
on
other
ground.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes
the
court
of
appeals
reached
it
on
the
equal
protection.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
well,
i
would
prefer
you
to
decide
it
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
sir.
