into

that
your
attribute

be
much
clearer,
public
teacher
or
preacher
of

gospel,
that
comma
makes
your
construction
of
it
a
little
more
difficult

the
construction
that
you
tell
us
that
the
district

columbia
courts
have
put
on.
justice

the
court
in
this
case,
that
the
section
by
its
terms
declare
void
only
bequest
and
devises
for
the
benefit
of
religious
institutions
or
by
the
clergy.

this

this
case
is

by
way
of
appeal
from
the
district
of

court
of
appeals.
a
woman
by
the
name
of
sallye
french
died
in
the
district
of
columbia
just
20
days
after
executing
a
will,
leaving
most
of
her
estate
to
certain
churches
in
the
district.
a
section
of
the
d.c.
code
makes
void
any
devise
or
bequest
to
a
religious
institution
made
within
30
days
of
death.
faced
with
this
provision
of
the
code,
the
appellee,
michael
m.
doyle,
asked
for
instructions
in
the
probate
division
of
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
both
that
court
and
ultimately
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional.
the
decedent's
heirs
and
next
of
kin
brought
an
appeal
to
this
court
under
a
section
of
volume
28
of
the
united
states
code
that
provides
for
review
by
appeal
in
cases
"where
is
drawn
in
question
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states
and
the
decision
is
against
its
validity."
we
postponed
consideration
of
the
question
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction
until
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
considerable
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
have
concluded
that
a
law
applicable
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
a
statute
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
provision
in
question.
accordingly,
the
appeal
is
dismissed
for
lack
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
treating
the
papers
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
we
are
required
by
law
to
do,
we
deny
the
petition.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
has
been
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell.
