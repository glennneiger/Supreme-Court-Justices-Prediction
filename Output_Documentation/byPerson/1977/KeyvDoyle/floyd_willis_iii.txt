mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
mention
the
statement
of
the
case
to
this
court.
this
case
involves
a
d.c
board,
main
statute,
section
18-302
and
that
statute
basically
provides
that
a
devise
or
bequest
of
real
or
personal
property
to
a
minister,
priest,
rabbi,
a
public
teacher
or
preacher
of
the
gospel
or
to
such
religious
order
and
so
on.
he
is
not
valid
unless
it
is
made
unless
it
is
made
within
30
days
before
the
death
of
the
testator.sallye
lipscomb
french
executed
a
will
and
left
religious
bequest
and
did
not
survive
that
will
for
30
days.
thereafter
a
complaint
for
instructions
was
filed
by
judge
doyle
and
the
case
was
heard
before
the
superior
court
on
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
religious
legatees
being
defendants
as
well
as
the
heirs
at
law.
the
lower
court
found
that
18-302
is
in
fact
unconstitutional
for
both
first
and
fifth
amendment
reasons.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
that
court
found
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
for
due
process
or
fifth
amendment
reasons.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
did
not
deal
first
amendment
judge
riley
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
he
dealt
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
a
next
thing,
i
was
going
to
get
to
now
that
i
have.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
in
inadvertence,
your
honor,
it
is
sort
of
hidden
way
down
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the,
one
of
your
rules
and
we
just
did
not
do
so.
we
did
a
make
statement
that
1257
(1)
is
a
basis
of
the
jurisdiction
but
we
did
not
argue
and
we
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
having
done
so.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
frankly
the
significance
of
that
escaped
us
to
and
we
are
now
prepared
to
argue
and
our
argument
would
be
very
brief
basically
based
on
palmore,
that
this
court
does
in
fact
have
appellate
jurisdiction.
because
of
1257
(1)
and
because
of
the
language
in
1257
(1)
which
states
that
the
--
for
purposes
of
this
section
and
i
think
the
language
must
include
the
whole
section,
paragraphs,
one
two
and
three,
so
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
include
district
of
columbia,
court
of
appeals.
and
in
palmore,
i
believe
your
honors
decided
basically
that
since
congress
had
not
said
that
the
appellate
right
of
mr.
palmore
were
because
the
statute
was
in
fact,
made
the
district
of
columbia
equivalent
to
a
state
statute
then
it
must
follow
in
our
reasoning
that
the
statute
is
in
fact
a
statute
of
united
state,
and
were
it
not
so,
i
think
that
the
additional
language
that
i
earlier
cited
would
have
no
meaning.
in
addition
to
that,
your
honors,
i
feel
that
there
are
substantial
federal
questions
involved
here
and
that
our
jurisdictional
statement
could
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
now
with
respect
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case,
it
is
submitted
that
this
statute
does
not
infringe
on
the
establishment
clause
over
the
free
exercise
clause
of
first
amendment.
at
first
blush
it
certainly
appears
to
involve
religion,
the
statute
is
directed
solely
at
religion.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
well
i
do
not
think
that
has
been
lower
courts
opinion
your
honor
it
said.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
think
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute
and
the
legislative
history
that
appears
in
a
congressional
record
that
the
statute
is
directed
only
at
religious
persons
or
institution.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
assume
that
is
the
case,
i
assume
that
someone
who
is
not
ordained
what
goes
about
preaching
a
religion
preset.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
well
that
is
conceivably,
your
honor,
i
am
not
totally
familiar
with
the
rules
and
regulations
involving
ordainment.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
think
those
are
just
consecutive
statements
of
who
the
statute
will
applied
to
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
comma
means.
now,
it
certainly
is
something
that
has
not
occurred
to
us
any
of
us
before
this
the
arguments
below
taken
somewhat
by
surprised
by
that
and
i
really
probably
do
not
have
a
good
answer
to
it.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
that
is
correct
that
has
been
the
position
of
both
judge
newman
and
the
dc
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
only
on
the
rationale
basis
doctrine.
it
decided
that
the
statute
had
no
objective
of
that
to
extend
withstand
a
statutory
scheme
that
would
make
it
consistent
with
the
constitution.
we
submit
that
the
statute
just
really
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
involving
a
testamentary
transfer
of
property.
a
power
reserved
solely
to
the
courts
and
solely
to
the
states
and
that
if
the
statute
involves
religion,
at
all
it
just
does
so
indirectly,
the
statute's
objective
is
to
prevent
the
improvident
gifts
to
buy
a
testator
within
this
very
brief
period
30
days,
since
the
making
of
a
will
and
i
think
it
has
two-
fold
and
a
prophylactic
basis.
it
is
to
preclude
the
use
of
undue
influence
by
religion
for
a
limited
period
of
30
days
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
undue
influence.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
your
honor
there
are
abilities
to
prevail
when
undue
influence
has
been
used
independent
of
the
statute.
certainly,
one
can
resort
to
the
courts
and
prove
that
undue
influence
would
have
caused
a
testamentary
disposition
and
by
a
caveat
proceeding.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
that
is
exactly
what
we
submit,
your
honor
i
did
not
understand
your
honor,
and
the
other
premise
of
the
statute
is
preclude
the
unwise
distribution
of
one's
estate
at
the
expense
of
one's
natural
heirs,
again
limited
solely
to
30
day
period.
i
submit
that
surely
the
effect
on
religion,
if
there
is
any
effect
at
all
is
less
then
existed
in
brawnfeld
wherein
huge
merchants
maintained
their
day
work
discriminated
against
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
and
they
were
not
able
to
stay
in
the
status
of
workings
on
sunday.
the
statute
is
not
designed
to
punish
religion
in
our
view,
or
to
limit
religious
practices
or
beliefs,
nor
it
is
purpose
to
establish
or
de-establish
religion.
it
prescribes
only
for
a
very
brief
period
testamentary
transfers
and
such
prescription
is
for
a
legitimate
state
purpose
that
is
the
legitimate
fear
of
government
that
there
is
a
mischief
that
can
be
perpetrated
by
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
says
at
least
more
readily
by
a
person
having
the
ability
to
express
to
a
testator,
the
possibility
of
salvation.
we
submit
that
the
statute
--
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
in
this
case
the
decision
would
clearly
be
regarded
as
dying
intestate,
your
honor,
the
statute
there
is
a
doctrine
of
independent
relative
or
dependent
relative
revocation
which
suggests
that
the
prior
will
made
a
similar
dispositive
scheme
then
the
prior
will
could
be
used
rather
than
intestacy.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
doctrine
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
there
were
two
prior
wills,
1960,
1963.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
well,
your
honor
the
statute
is
not
so
thin
because
she
did
not
in
fact
make
the
same
sort
of
religious
bequest
in
her
prior
wills,
only
in
the
will
in
which
she
failed
to
survive
for
a
period
of
30
days
did
which
she
make
a
substantial
residuary
bequest
to
religious
institutions
and
actually
she
made
those
bequest
to
three
religious
institutions,
john
hopkins
university
although
it
is
not
a
church
as
such
it
is
run
by
the
church
and
maintained
by
the
church
and
there
has
been
some
--
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
of
columbia
said
legal
ledger
domain
that
has
enabled
the
statute
to
be
gotten
around
on
occasion
by
declaring
that
a
bequest
to
a
charitable
institution
which
is
owned
and
run
by
a
religion
is
not
the
same
as
a
bequest
to
a
religion
per
se
and
much
emphasis
is
put
on
that
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
columbia.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
no
only
the
bequests
are
declared
to
be
invalid,
those
bequest
to
religious
persons
institutions
etc.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
we
conceded
that
john
hopkins
does
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
this
statute.
the
john
hopkins
is
not
in
fact
an
institution
a
church
institution
as
such
but
rather
is
an
educational
institutional
that
is
incidentally
operated
by
the
church
and
we
have
done
so
because
the
dc
law
has
been
very
clear
that
they
would
hold
in
that
fashion.
there
was
also
specific
bequest
of
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
in
this
case,
again
a
non-sectarian
institution
which
is
run
by
catholic
order.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
well
there
is
some
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
suggest
that
if
you
are
in
fact
giving
it
to
the
individual
because
he
is
an
individual
rather
than
a
priest
that
the
statute
would
not
have
its
effect.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
they
made
serious
(inaudible)
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
feel
that
it
has
if
any
effect
at
all,
only
a
very
minimal
effect
on
the
exercise
of
religion,
the
30
day
period
for
one
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
been
gotten
around
on
many
other
occasions.
now,
i
just
kind
of
lost
my
place.
we
also
submit
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
we
submit
that
you
do
not
have
to
reach
the
religious
issue.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
if
you
reach
the
issue
that
it
violates
the
due
process.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
and
also
the
first
amendment
of
the
lower
court,
the
superior
court
of
district
of
columbia.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
you
reverse
and
remand
the
case
back,
i
believe.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
would
hope
that
would
be
the
case
although
i
have
certainly
prepared
here
--
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
understand
that
and
i
argued
that
because
i
felt
that
it
was
likely
that
your
honors
would
want
to
hear
the
first
amendment
argument.
the
lower
court
certainly
made
that
argument
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
riley
certainly
made
that
argument.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
it
does
bear
in
this
fashion
though,
your
honor
on
a
procedural
or
a
substantive
due
process
or
equal
protection,
the
question
becomes
in
is
there
a
fundamental
issue
involved
that
requires
strict
scrutiny
as
opposed
to
the
rational
basis
and
getting
to
rational
basis,
if
in
fact
the
statute
does
create
a
classification,
these
classification
do
not
offend
constitutional
safeguards
of
the
fifth
amendment,
because
the
classifications
are
clearly
related
to
the
statute's
objective.
that
is,
as
i
have
already
said
to
protect
the
testator
during
this
very
brief
period
when
they
might
be
inclined
to
leave
their
property
in
a
unwise
fashion
and
also
i
believe
to
preclude
the
church
from
exercising
its
unique
abilities
to
influence
gifts
to
religion.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
i
think
is
rational
your
honor
and
that
is
the
test.
under--
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
that
is
correct,
judge
newman,
for
instance
picked
that
a
25
year
old
ferrari
driver.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
clearly
is
one
of
those
unfortunate
situations
that
runs
a
foul
of
the
statute
but
i
do
not
think
that
makes
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
no,
i
do
not
think,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
an
issue
that
has
to
be
decided
by
this
court
and
was
addressed
by
the
lower
courts,
that
the
statute
may
very
well
apply
to
the
people
in
the
prime
of
their
life
who
do
not
contemplate
death
and
it
may
very
well
allow
people
who
die
31
days
after
of
a
terminal
illness
to
escape
the
effect
of
the
statute.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
the
irrebuttable
presumption
was
specifically
decided
to
be
invalid
by
this
court.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
the
hyner(ph).
later
the
irs
that
went
to
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
that
certainly
is
also
something
it
could
be
argued
here
that
why
not
and
i
think
judge
newman
said
this
why
not
have
a
rebuttable
presumption
so
that
there
could
be
some
kind
of
procedural
due
process
review
so
that,
justice
burger's
example
would
the
free
from
the
effect
of
the
statute.
well,
i
submit
to
you
there
is
a
couple
of
reasons,
one
the
testator
is
always
dead,
so
the
motives
of
the
testator
are
never
going
to
be
able
to
be
discovered
and
two
it
is
awfully
hard
to
imagine
at
a
due
process
hearing,
the
person
who
exercised
that
undue
influence
coming
in
and
conceding
it.
i
think
it
would
be
a
futile
act
to
have
a
due
process
hearing
on
to
that
situation.
if,
in
fact
this
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption
and
i
think
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
is
the
only
time,
we
are
going
to
have
to
have
a
due
process
theory
to
determine.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
think
if
that
person
was
in
fact
a
resident
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
statute
that
bequest
would
be
declared
invalid.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
i
guess
there
will
have
to
be
some
feeling
that
he
was
in
fact
a
religious
person,
your
honor
that
would,
he
would
be
i
believe
allowed
to
come
in
on
a
due
process
basis
and
show
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
to
him,
just
as
somebody
would
be
allowed
to
show
that
no
--
the
date
on
this
will
is
in
fact
31
days
before.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
bishop
is
not
a
clergymen,
i
always
thought
that
all
bishops
were
clergymen.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
well,
if
he
could
show,
if
he
could
make
a
showing
that
he
was
not
a
clergymen,
that
his
title
of
bishop
did
not
in
fact
mean
that,
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
--.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
as
i
have
indicated,
i
believe
this
to
be
a
rational
classification,
largely
because
of
the
unique
ability
of
religions
to
prevail
this
kind
of
influence.
while
it
is
true
and
it
is
something
that
the
lower
courts
address
themselves
to,
that
there
are
other
classes
of
people
who
may
have
an
equal
opportunity,
that
is
access
wise
to
influence
the
testator;
our
submission
is
as
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
to
that,
none
of
them
possess
the
ability
to
suggest
salvation
in
return
for
a
substantial
request.
also,
suggested
there
is
way,
the
harsh
aspect
of
this
statute
could
have
been
voided,
particularly
in
the
case
of
sallye
lipscomb
french,
her
wills
were
written
by
a
lawyer,
she
was
87
years
old.
it
appears
likely
that
her
life
span
was
a
short
one.
she
certainly
could
have
made
an
inter
vivos
trust
which
would
exist
for
31
days
or
35
days,
which
would
dispose
off
the
identical
property
that
she
disposed
off
by
her
will,
and
it
could
have
been.
so
that
there
was
a
way
that
the
harshness
of
the
statute
could
have
been
avoided.
if
in
fact,
she
was
a
rational
person
not
affected
by
undue
influence
then
she
could
have
elected
to
do
so
and
she
is
not
a
welfare
recipient
who
is
not
going
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
having
to
go
to
lawyer
and
write
a
will,
as
has
been
the
problem
in
some
of
the
illegitimacy
cases
that
your
honors
had
decided.
i
submit
that
in
the
irrebuttable
presumption
area
the
case
decided
by
your
honors
of
weinberger
v.
salfi
is
controlling.
in
that
case
as
you
may
recall
there
was
a
irrebuttable
presumption
as
such
that
one
who
marries
a
person
entitled
to
welfare
benefits
and
not
welfare
social
security
benefits,
and
that
marriage
fails
to
survive
for
a
nine
month
period,
that
the
widow
is
in
fact
not
entitled
to
the
survivor
benefits
and
your
honors
have
decided
that,
that
statute
is
in
fact
a
prophylactic
one
as
this
one
is
a
preventive
one
that
does
not
require
anything
other
than
the
showing
that
in
fact
they
do
not
meet
the
standards
that
are
required
under
that
statute
and
that
is
the
same
i
believe
the
facts
here,
except
we
are
only
dealing
with
30
days,
we
are
not
dealing
with
nine
months.
mr.
salfi,
in
fact
died
of
a
heart
attack
and
the
suggestion
is
that
it
could
have
been
shown
if
allowed
by
mr.
salfi,
that
he
was
a
healthy
man
and
his
marriage
was
entered
in
to
not
for
the
shame
but
rather
as
a
genuine
marriage.
i
submit
also
now
that
we
have
already
talked
about
a
little
bit
that
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
standard,
i
submit
the
statute
has
a
clearly
secular
purpose,
that
is
to
protect
the
testator
and
the
heirs
and
to
prevent
a
particular
class,
a
defined
class
from
exercising
undo
influence
within
a
very
limited
period.
its
primary
effect,
i
think
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion
and
i
emphasize
the
words
'primary
effect'
and
there
is
no
excessive
entanglement
with
religion
in
this
case,
no
more
so
certainly
than
in
the
tax
case
was.
and
in
that
situation
as
i
indicated
the
primary
effect
portion
of
that
standard
is
one
that
most
closely
be
reviewed.
the
question
becomes
in
my
view,
in
our
view,
he
is
the
incidentally
impact
on
religion
that
is
the
denial
of
this
bequest.
here
assuming
that
there
is
an
incidental
impact,
which
results
from
the
non-fundamental
interest
of
a
scheme
of
testamentary
disposition
obviously
one
which
does
not
have
a
fundamental
right
attached
to
it;
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
right
to
testamentary
disposition
without
state
procedures
in
any
of
event,
is
that
incidental
impact
sufficient
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny,
and
i
submit
that
in
the
standard
that
your
honors
have
previously
made
the
'primary
effect'
clearly
eliminates
incidental
impact
and
consequently
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
that
must
be
shown
by
the
heirs
at
law
or
ordinarily
by
the
district
of
columbia
government
but
they
have
declined
to
become
involved
in
this
after
the
superior
court
case.
further,
i
suggest
that
what
the
courts
below
have
done
is
they
have
substituted
their
own
judgment
for
what
is
purely
a
legislative
function.
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
statute,
they
do
not
like
the
statute
and
as
a
consequence,
they
declare
the
statute
to
be
violative
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
the
statute
may
no
longer
be
as
valid
as
it
once
was,
it
is
an
1866
statute,
the
same
congress
that
passed
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
judge
pomeroy
in
a
dissent
in
a
case
from
pennsylvania,
in
re
estate
of
cavill
(ph),
said
that
in
an
age
when
the
hope
of
salvation
may
be
less
vivid
and
the
fear
of
damnation
less
acute
than
formerly
it
was,
one
may
disagree
with
the
wisdom
or
necessity
of
the
provision
before
today
but
wisdom
whether
that
this
of
court
or
the
legislature
is
not
determinative
of
legislative
power,
thank
you.
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
oh
yes
your
honor
i
want
to
just
brief
on
--
mr.
floyd
willis,
iii
just
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
i
submit
that
what
my
brother
says
is
not
accurate
because
the
statute
would
not
include
the
last
paragraph
that
is
1257
would
not
include
the
last
paragraph,
if
congress
did
not
mean
for
the
state,
this
court
to
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
comment
was
made
that
dc
has
not
appeared,
the
district,
the
government
has
not
appeared,
i
submit
to
you
because
of
the
diminimus
effect
of
the
statute
has
on
the
district
of
columbia
and
not
because
they
feel
it
is
unconstitutional.
the
very
distinction
between
this
statute
and
all
other
statutes
of
alike
nature
is
what
makes
this
statute
more
rational.
