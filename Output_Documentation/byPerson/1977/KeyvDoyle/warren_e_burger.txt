chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
next
in
76-1057
key
against
doyle.
mr.
willis,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
not
it
include
school
teachers
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
addressing
the
statute
as
a
whole
on
my
question
goes
to
that,
it
says
ministers,
priest,
rabbi,
public
teacher
or
preacher
at
the
gospel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
public
teachers
of
religion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
next
category
preachers
of
the
gospel
would
be
redundant
because
there
are
lot
of
preachers
at
the
gospel
who
are
not
ordained
ministers,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
apply,
if
one
of
the
members
of
the
professional
football
team
27,
28
years
old
makes
a
will,
leaving
everything
to
a
church,
then
the
airplane
carrying
them
down
to
houston,
texas
for
a
football
game
crashes
10
days
later,
does
that
have
any
set
statute
rationale
as
applied
to
that
situation
or
that
is
the
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute
rationale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
reason,
i
picked
the
27
year
old
professional
football
players
that
i
suspect
he
was
not
anticipating
death
at
the
time
he
made
that
will.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
might
be
more
dangerous.
does
it
make
any
sense,
is
there
are
any
elements
of
under
influence
as
applying
to
an
accidental
death
occurring?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event
we
would
not
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case
because
we
do
not
have
a
27
year
old
professional
football
player.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
willis.
mr
bauersfeld.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anyway
if
you
do
not
need
both,
if
you
can
persuade
us
on
one,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
right
of
any
testator
to
give,
makes
bequest
to
some,
give
legacies
to
anyone,
to
any
church
or
all
churches?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think,
your
time
is
expired
now,
i
think
your
friend
has
one
minute
left.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
he
is
going
to
give
us
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
76-1057,
key
and
others
against
doyle
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
