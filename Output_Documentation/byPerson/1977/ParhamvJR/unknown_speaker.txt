unknown
speaker
is
there
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
well
you
do
not
suggest
--
i
take
it
you
do
not
suggest
maybe
you
do,
the
parent's
consent
or
decision
is
sufficient
in
itself.
unknown
speaker
your
submission
that
the
child
that
the
lacks
liberty
interest
to
such
an
extent
that
the
parent's
decision
standing
alone
is
enough.
unknown
speaker
what
else
must
there
be
besides
the
parent's
decision
to
hospitalize
the
child?
unknown
speaker
so
somebody
should
look
over
the
shoulder
of
the
doctor
and
the
parent
or
not?
unknown
speaker
together,
if
they
act
together.
unknown
speaker
if
they
act
together.
unknown
speaker
well
to
put
it
strictly,
everybody
has
a
right
to
due
process
do
they
not?
if
they
are
going
to
be
denied
a
liberty
of
property
interest,
you
never
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
applicable
or
something,
you
can
say
that
what
was
done
did
not
deprive
them
of
any
liberty
or
property.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
would
not
take
the
child
just
on
the
say-so
of
the
parent
and
the
parent's
doctor.
unknown
speaker
so
you
go
through
still
a
further
procedure.
unknown
speaker
and
you
decide
that
is
how
that
is
medically
indicated
to
or
that
treatment
is
indicated.
unknown
speaker
ask
to
your
gatekeeper,
he
can
say
no
as
to
admission
to
a
state
facility
for
the
parents
and
their
doctors
have
said
yes.
but
he
can
not
say
yes
if
the
parents
or
their
doctors
say
no.
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
existence
of
that
possible
liability
do
not
the
private
institutions
follow
precisely
the
same
procedure
as
the
state
institutions
does.
do
not
they
examine
before
they
admit.
unknown
speaker
so
what
it
the
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
but
the
wealthy
person
must
have
--
the
wealthy
parent
can
commit
the
child
if
the
parent
of
the
committing
institution
--
i
mean
if
the
doctor
of
the
committing
institution
will
receive
the
child.
that
is
exactly
what
happens
here,
but
you
are
saying
that
will
continue
to
be
the
case
whereas
the
district
court
changed
the
rule
for
the
court.
unknown
speaker
now,
one
of
these
named
plaintiffs;
now
i
realize
one
of
the
them
is
now
deceased,
but
some
members
of
this
class
were
committed
at
the
behest
of
the
state
as
guide
--
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
category,
it
clearly
is
state
action
i
suppose,
the
state
initiates
it.
unknown
speaker
you
did
concede
it.
unknown
speaker
so
really
your
argument
is
at
a
moot
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
part
of
your
position
and
that
participation
by
the
state
namely
the
doctor
of
the
institution
takes
a
look
at
the
child.
that
is
an
essential
condition
to
the
deprivation
of
liberty,
assuming
it
is
a
deprivation,
assuming
it
is
a
liberty
--
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is
essential
because
it
is
part
of
the
regular
procedure
and
are
you
still
arguing
it
is
not
state
action?
unknown
speaker
but
he
cannot
get
in
the
hospital
unless
the
state
examines
him
and
says
yes
you
can
come
in.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
arguing
(ph)
him
on
the
merits
is
it,
that
is
an
essential
part
of
the
procedure.
unknown
speaker
and
you
still
say
it
is
not
state
action.
unknown
speaker
and
they
not
only
do
not
let
him
in
unless
they
agree,
but
then
they
implement
the
decision.
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
parent
does
not
necessarily
come
to
the
hospital
armed
already
with
a
physician's
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
will
examine
the
child
and
take
the
child
even
though
there
is
no
other
medical
opinion
but
the
state's.
unknown
speaker
you
think
under
the
order
the
--
i
think
you
were
asked
to
survey
on
this,
state
may
completely
release
the
46
children.
unknown
speaker
the
state
has
been
ordered
to
provide
them
with
the
more
appropriate
setting.
unknown
speaker
you
have
been
--
with
respect
to
them
you
must
provide
the
state
must
--
has
been
ordered
to
provide
different
treatment
setting.
unknown
speaker
well
the
claim
is
not
that
it
is
a
due
process
substitute,
but
that
it
is
adequate
under
what
is
required
by
the
constitution
that
it
is
due
process.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
that
district
court
went
to
the
hospitals
and
looked
at
the
procedures,
did
one
or
more
of
the
judges
sit
in
on
--
say
an
interview
between
the
psychiatrist
and
the
family
or
--
unknown
speaker
now
all
of
these
defects
and
doubts
that
you
are
not
talking
about
are
equally
applicable
i
suppose,
when
the
question
is
whether
an
adult
should
be
received
in
one
of
these
hospital,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
same
uncertainty
about
science
of
psychiatry
and
the
same
biases
pro-institutional
biases
on
the
part
of
psychiatrist
and
so
on
and
there
is
no
claim
that
an
adult
presents
himself
after
having
consulted
with
a
doctor,
that
anything
is
required
beyond
what
is
presently
accorded,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
i
am
speaking
of
voluntary
admission.
so
this
case
really
boils
down,
parses
down,
does
it
not,
to
the
claim
that
the
understanding
of
the
law
that
has
existed
for
centuries
that
a
parent
makes
decision
for
his
minor
child
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
not
that
been
the
presumption
of
the
law
forever.
the
anglo-saxon
law
that
now
there
is
matter
of
definition,
what
is
a
child?
i
suppose
that
law
has
never
said
that
person
35-years-old
is
still
a
child,
but
subject
--
setting
aside
those
problems
of
definition,
has
not
the
law
always
been
that
a
parent
makes
decisions
for
his
or
her
minor
child
where
that
child
is
going
to
be
educated,
how
that
child
is
going
to
be
punished,
where
that
child
--when
and
if
the
child
is
going
to
go
the
hospital,
what
time
the
child
is
going
to
bed,
what
time
he
is
going
to
get,
up,
what
time
he
is
going
to
have
breakfast,
lunch
and
dinner.
the
implicit
recognition
of
the
law
in
our
society.
unknown
speaker
or
both.
unknown
speaker
the
jest
is
that
your
attack
is
on
that
basic
presumption
in
this
context
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
no
attack
at
all
on
the
procedures,
and
so
far
as
they
are
applicable
to
adults.
unknown
speaker
well
this
is
voluntary,
if
you
presume
that
a
parent
can
stake
for
its
child.
this
is
purely
voluntary
--
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
that
review
tell
me
if
you
would
or
if
you
prefer
to
do
it
after
the
review,
how
you
distinguish
the
hospitalization
in
a
mental
facility
from
hospitalization
for
the
tonsillectomy
or
for
appendectomy
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
well
certainly
while
you
are
recovering
from
a
serious
operation
you
are
confined
in
a
hospital
in
the
same
way
you
are
confined
in
a
mental
institution.
unknown
speaker
well
these
are
voluntary
--
is
this
true
for
voluntary,
so
called
voluntary
commitment
because
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
unknown
speaker
as
the
law
set
up
all
sorts
of
processes
and
conditional
voluntary
commitment?
unknown
speaker
no
so
the
basis,
your
attack
is
on
the
basic
proposition
and
that
is
been
accepted
and
that
a
parent
makes
decisions
for
each
child.
unknown
speaker
when
the
state
--
the
colleague
here,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
does
not
contended
that
the
state
can
just
take
the
parent's
word
and
put
the
child
in
the
hospital?
unknown
speaker
well
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
medical
advice.
i
think
your
problem
is
to
convince
the
medical
advisor,
the
procedures
of
the
hospital
are
not
adequate
because
none
of
those
people
take
the
word
of
the
parent.
they
say
do
you
want
your
child
treated,
we
will
treat
him.
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
10.
unknown
speaker
well
it
certainly
implied
that
the
juvenile
court
procedures
were
adequate,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
committed
through
those
procedures.
then
there
is
another
procedure,
the
ordinary
court
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
called?
the
ordinary
court.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
ordinary?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
like,
a
probate
court
or.
unknown
speaker
your
objection
to
a
panel
of
psychiatrist
ten
or
twelve
i
suppose
would
be
that
they
are
not
--
that
they
have
this
pro-institutional
bias
and
these,
that
they
would
not
be
neutral
hearing
officers,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
said
outside.
outside
psychiatrist
--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
point
was
that
there
ought
to
be
a
procedure
for
cross-examining
this
by
the
experts
and
psychiatrists.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
four-year-old
child?
unknown
speaker
but,
maybe
and
i
say
maybe,
that
is
all
i
do
not
need
to
be
there,
conceivably
that
might
be
the
best
place
for
them
among
the
various
options,
now
available
in
georgia,
including
their
own
families
or
some
other
hospital
or
some
other
institution
or
possibly
a
foster
family,
but
it
maybe
be
impossible
to
find
foster
family.
unknown
speaker
how
does
georgia
define
a
child,
at
what
age.
what
age
are
we
talking
about.
after
what
age?
unknown
speaker
through's
age
17,
is
that
the
statutory
definition
in
georgia.
up
to
the
18th
birthday?
unknown
speaker
and
from
then
on,
over
18
it
is
an
adult
for
this
purpose
under
georgia
law.
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
overstatement,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
whether
you
expect
to
reach
what
has
been
called
a
substantive
due
process
issue.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
that
much
time
left.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
them,
how
do
you
construe
the
ruling?
unknown
speaker
could
they
relieve
it
by
simply
releasing
them
from
custody?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
you
read
the
decree?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
way
you
read
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
under
the
holding
of
the
district
court,
is
the
procedure
invalid
even
as
applied
to
that
narrow
category.
i
suppose
it
is.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lackey,
as
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
it
would
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
say
to
a
parent,
if
you
want
to
keep
your
child
in
the
basement
for
the
next
three
years
because
you
think
it'd
be
healthy
to
keep
them
out
of
the
sunlight
or
something
like
that,
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
because
they
have
to
rely
on
the
wisdom
of
the
legislature
not
to
pass
that
statutes.
but
you
say
that
if
they
did,
there'd
be
no
constitutional
objection
to
it.
but
rather
a
difficult
position
to
maintain
--
unknown
speaker
it
is
indeed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lackey,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
even
to
the
heart
operation,
that
there
must
be
a
hearing,
it
may
mean
that
there
must
be
due
process
but
would
it
not
be
at
least
logical
to
say
that
the
doctor
and
the
parent
provide
adequate
process
in
that
situation
with
that
or
perhaps
or
at
least
arguments
why
a
different
process
might
apply
where
there's
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
between
the
child
and
his
parent.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
said,
treated
in
the
community
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
may
i
take
one
of
your
hypotheticals.
unknown
speaker
a
parent
observes
what
parent
regards
as
aberrant
behavior
on
behalf
of
--
on
the
the
part
of
the
child.
unknown
speaker
and
takes
him
now,
i
gather
to
a
local
community
health
centers,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
who
are
the
professionals
on
duty
there?
unknown
speaker
not
doctors?
unknown
speaker
and
whoever
it
is,
one
or
more,
is
it
one
or
more
professionals?
unknown
speaker
and
one
or
more
professionals
make
a
diagnosis,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
diagnosis
is
the
child
may
be
mentally
ill,
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
but
again,
who
are
the
professionals
involved
if
it's
a
treatment
as
an
outpatient.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
doesn't
work
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
--
is
a
one,
one
in
the
state
or
more?
unknown
speaker
and
these
are
nothing
but
mental
hospitals,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
for
confinement
as
well
as
for
treatment.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
happens
to
the
child
referred
to
one
of
those
hospitals?
unknown
speaker
i
would
say
admitted.
unknown
speaker
or
committed
which
--
unknown
speaker
because
my
hypothetical
was
that
the
parent
initiated
this
initially.
unknown
speaker
so,
this
might
be
true,
a
voluntary
admission?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
all
along
the
line,
there's
no
procedure
for
questioning
the
judgments
which
result
ultimately
on
what
you've
styled
in
admission,
the
professional
judgments.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
any
one.
unknown
speaker
what
stage
is
that?
unknown
speaker
biggest
stage?
unknown
speaker
is
that
habeas?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
--
in
our
hypothetical,
what
--
how
would
it
occur
with
the
youngster
involved--
unknown
speaker
you
go
to
court?
unknown
speaker
at
whatever
stage?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
as
you've
described
to
them
mr.
lackey.
it's
rather
a
happen
stance
that
they
were
referred
to
lawyers.
there's
no
champion
on
it,
so-called
for
the
child
as
the
child
goes
through
these
procedures.
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
the
child
get
to
that
advocacy
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
so,
relying
on
the
parent
is
really
critical
in
the
case
where
you're
committing
for
just
for
treatment
rather
than
because
someone
is
dangerous.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
do
and
that
you
regularly
commit
for
--
purely
for
purposes
of
treatment.
unknown
speaker
at
the
--
at
--
with
--
at
the
request
of
the
parents.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lackey,
i
take
it
before
us
in
the
georgia
case,
they're
only
state
hospitals.
yeah,
there
are
no
private
ones
that
--
as
i
think
as
the
case
in
the
pennsylvania
litigation.
unknown
speaker
and
secondly,
perhaps
you
answer
this
in
your
colloquially
with
justice
brennan
but
in
georgia,
may
habeas
be
used
to
gain
release
on
the
ground
that
a
child
is
no
longer
ill.
unknown
speaker
but
a
habeas
wouldn't
lie
if
the
behest
of
the
child,
say
a
17-year-old
child
confined
called
up
a
lawyer
and
asked
him
to
file
for
habeas
and
the
parents
came
in
and
asked
for
dismissal.
unknown
speaker
when
the
parents
--
if
the
parents
want
him
out,
he'll
come
under
the
law,
they
--
he
is
to
be
released.
unknown
speaker
but
they
will
entertain
habeas
at
the
behest
of
a
child
who
makes
to
claim
that
he
is
no
longer
mentally
ill.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
parents
are
dead.
unknown
speaker
how
about
to
40?
how
about
the
children
who
were
ordered
to
be
differently
placed,
are
they
still
on
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
and
to
comply
we
would
have
to
be
placed
in
different
context
or
in
different
environments.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
statute
do
about
them?
unknown
speaker
does
this
provide
any
additional
facilities
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cromartie,
before
you
leave
it,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
new
statute
does
not
have
any
effect
at
all
if
the
decision
is
reversed.
unknown
speaker
so
that
it's
fair
to
say
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
is
that
the
district
court
is
all
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
makes
no
change
in
the
preexisting
statute
unless
there
is
an
affirmance.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
presume
that
--
if
that
where
they
get
their
advice.
that's
their
judgment
in
any
event,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
substance
of
due
process
issue
is?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
district
court's
opinion
and
judgment
expressly
or
implicitly
says
that
anyone
who
is
confined,
any
child
who
is
confined
under
this
law
is
entitled
to
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
it's
a
--
do
you
think
the
district
court
held
that
a
child
who's
committed
that
the
request
of
the
parents
and
checked
out
what
the
state
doctor
is
entitled
to
treatment
while
he
is
confined.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
is
implicit
in
the
second
--
with
respect
to
this
40,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
cases
that
would
support
that?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
the
treatment
in
addition
to
confinement?
unknown
speaker
let's
say
there's
no
harm,
say
there's
no
harm.
they
--
they're
just
confinement,
that
state
just
confines
at
the
request
of
the
parent.
unknown
speaker
that
could
be
just
because
the
parents
requested
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
children
like
that
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
my
brother
stewart's
hypothetical,
who
initiates
the
commitment?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
neighbor
may?
unknown
speaker
social
worker?
unknown
speaker
who
has
treated
--
who
has
treated
it
different?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cromartie,
aren't
you
--
don't
you
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
trying
to
distinguish
on
the
basis
of
the
magnitude
of
the
deprivation.
i
thought
your
case
rested
on
the
point
mr.
justice
stewart
made
earlier,
that
the
common
law
presumption
rest
on
the
notion
that
there's
a
community
of
interest
between
the
parent
and
the
child
where
there
would
be
in
the
tuberculosis
case
and
the
leg
amputation,
all
the
rest.
but
your
point
as
i
understood
here
in
your
brief
was
in
part
that
you
can't
be
so
sure
there's
a
community
of
interest
in
the
mental
institution
context
when
the
parent
is
asking
that
the
child
be
placed
in
the
home
because
it
may
will
be
a
family
conflict
that
--
is
the
source
of
the
problem.
so,
isn't
the
scope
of
your
argument
limited
to
the
case
in
which
the
basis
for
the
common
law
presumption
is
no
longer
applicable?
unknown
speaker
and
that
point
really
doesn't
apply
to
any
of
these
other
hypothetical
examples
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cromartie
--
excuse
me
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
but
if
--
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
make
sure
in
georgia
now,
if
the
state
doctor
determines
that
the
child
is
mentally
ill,
does
he
also
have
to
determine
that
he
would
benefit
from
the
treatment?
unknown
speaker
and
does
he
also
--
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
be
--
will
that
be
an
issue
on
remand
under
the
district
court's
remand?
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
doctor
also
have
to
find
that
there
are
some
advantages
to
treating
in
the
state
institution
rather
than
at
home?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
under
the
present
georgia
law,
if
the
parent
says,
“well,
i
know
a
lot
but
i
just
am
--
i
just
can't
handle
them
at
home.
i
agree
with
you
that
he
could
be
treated
at
home
but
we
just
can't
get
along
with
them
at
home.”
under
the
present
georgia
law,
the
state
must
reject
them?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
the
law
permits
them
to
take
that
kind
of
a
child
just
because
--
although
he
could
be
treated
at
home,
the
parents
just
don't
want
to
treat
him
at
home.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cromartie,
would
a
new
statute
require
a
finding
that
the
two
now
would
benefit
from
treatment?
unknown
speaker
an
affirmant
of
finding.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
suppose
he
could
be
appropriately
treated
in
the
institution
in
the
sense
that
you
can
now
administer
the
treatment
there.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
the
parent
comes
to
the
state
and
say,
“well,
i
know
we
could
treat
them
at
home
but
i
know
i
think
and
my
doctors
says,
he
could
be
treated
in
the
institution
also.
that
the
state
may
take
him.”
unknown
speaker
how
about
under
the
new
law?
