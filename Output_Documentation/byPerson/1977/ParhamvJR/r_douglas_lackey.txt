mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia
statute,
which
recognizes
the
right
of
parents
and
guardians
to
make
application
for
admission
of
their
minor
children
to
state
mental
health
facilities.
this
law
suit
is
predicated
upon
two
grounds,
the
first
ground
is
that
these
children
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
challenge
their
parent's
medic
decisions
as
to
what
medically
indicated
treatment
will
be
provided
to
children
and
that
the
challenge
statute
here
which
provides
for
neither
notice
nor
hearing
before
hospitalization
deprives
them
of
that
right
with
that
due
process
of
law.
the
second
ground
is
that
mentally
ill
children
have
a
constitutional
right
when
they
receive
state
treatment
from
the
state,
to
receive
that
treatment
only
in
the
treatment
setting
which
is
most
appropriate
to
their
condition.
this
law
suit
was
brought
by
two
boys
age
12
and
13
at
the
time
of
this
litigation.
each
had
been
in
state
mental
health
facility
for
over
five
years,
each
had
been
admitted
under
the
challenge
code
section
one
by
his
parents,
the
other
by
his
guardian
and
state
agency.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
the
litigation
we
admitted
that
these
two
boys
as
well
as
44
other
children
who
were
then
in
the
mental
health
facility
could
be
treated
for
their
condition
in
other
facilities
which
we
considered
more
appropriate.
two
facts
which
do
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
which
i
want
to
bring
to
court's
attention
is
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs
is
now
deceased
j.l.
the
other
is
that,
some
of
these
children
are
still
in
the
hospital.
the
district
court
in
essence
agreed
with
appellees
on
both
grounds,
finding
that
in
fact
the
children
have
a
liberty
interest
and
that
they
were
deprived
of
it
by
the
operation
of
this
statute
and
finding
that
the
children
had
a
substantive
due
process
right
which
was
violated
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
there
are
in
essence
two
issues
before
the
court
then,
the
first
is
whether
these
children
are
entitled
to
procedural
due
process
rights
and
whether
they
receive
it
under
statue
and
the
second
is
whether
the
children
have
a
right
if
they
are
to
receive
treatment
from
the
state
to
receive
that
treatment
only
in
the
best
facility,
turning
to
the
first
issue
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
language
that
the
district
court
used
was
the
treatment
setting
most
appropriate
to
the
child's
condition
and
we
interpret
that
to
being
the
best,
that
anything
less
than
the
best
would
not
be
the
most
appropriate.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
the
complaint
asked
for
$10,000
damage
for
each
child,
the
district
court
did
not
address
that
issue.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
from
state,
from
the
state
employees.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
the
parents
are
not
parties
to
this
law
suit.
they
are
in
essence
with
respect
to
the
procedure
due
process
issue,
three
sub
issues,
one
of
which
the
court
itself
advanced
that
being
the
question
of
state
action
here.
the
other
two
are
the
question
of
whether
a
child
in
fact
has
a
liberty
interest
in
this
situation
and
if
a
child
does
have
liberty
interest
there
is
state
action
what
processes
do.
turning
first
to
the
liberty
interest
we
look
to
the
district
court's
analysis
of
the
case
the
district
court
said
in
essence
that
children
have
a
liberty
interest
for
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
said
so
in
its
decision
in
the
case
of
henry
goll
(ph).
hospitalization
is
a
massive
curtailment
of
that
liberty
for
again
the
supreme
court
said
so
in
humphrey
versus
cady.
the
district
court
then
put
the
two
together
and
concluded
that
these
children
were
deprived
of
liberty
interest
or
that
due
process
of
law.
our
position
is,
is
that
the
district
court's
analysis
is
flawed
because
the
district
court
focused
on
the
wrong
interest.
it
is
a
fundamental
or
a
threshold
issue
that
in
any
litigation
where
what
is
challenged
or
what
is
alleged
is
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
interest
that
you
must
look
to
the
interest
itself
to
see
whether
in
fact
it
can
be
fairly
said
as
in
this
case
to
fall
within
the
diameter
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
well
we
suggested
the
court
that
the
interest
is
here
is
the
interest
in
the
child
to
challenge
his
parent's
medically
indicated
decision,
for
that
is
exactly
what
the
district
court
is
allowing
the
child
to
do
by
asserting
that
the
child
is
deprived
of
the
liberty
interest
by
being
hospitalized.
it
is
our
position
that
this
analysis
is
inconsistent
with
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
court's
opinions,
state
court
decisions
as
well
as
the
history
of
western
civilization.
in
our
civilization
in
our
society
we
have
determined
that
children
cannot
make
certain
decision
for
themselves.
one
of
these
decisions
that
we
--
one
of
these
area
in
which
we
have
made
this
determination
is
in
the
area
of
selecting
medically
indicated
treatment
both
at
common
law
and
in
case
law
of
this
country,
we
have
said
that
parents
select
medically
indicated
treatment
for
there
children,
their
children
do
not
select
that
treatment
themselves.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
you
are
restrained
in
a
sense
there
is
no
denying
that.
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
discloses
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
well
a
parent
has
the
right
to
restrain
a
child
independent
of
this
case,
but
i
think
what
the
record
discloses
here
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
suppose
parents
restrain
children
until
they
reach
their
majority.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
that
is
correct,
you
could
not.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it
is
not
absolute,
of
course
not
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
can
see
a
difference
in
those
two
extremes
certainly
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
what
i
am
--
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
here,
quite
honestly
sir
is
that
if
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
the
child
at
all
to
challenge
his
parent's
decision
to
hospitalize
him.
that
liberty
interest
must
cut
completely
across
the
whole
spectrum.
it
is
not
plausible
to
say
that
a
constitutional
right
exist
in
a
child
when
the
child's
parents
wants
to
place
him
in
a
mental
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
did
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
in
this
circumstance
the
parent's
decision
standing
alone
is
not
enough
in
actuality
in
any
case
where
what
we
are
speaking
of
is
medically
indicated
treatment
the
parent's
decision
is
not
enough
the
state
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
in
this
specific
case
there
must
be
the
concurrence
of
a
physician
that
what
the
parent
desire
for
the
child
is
actually
what
is
in
the
child's
best
interest.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
our
position
is
that
no
one
should
look
over
the
shoulder
of
the
doctor
and
the
parent
or
the
doctor.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
if
they
act
together.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
the
law
in
georgia
and
in
most
of
the
states
makes
no
difference
between
different
practitioners
of
medicine,
it
simply
defines
them
as
physicians.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir
he
would
not
have
to
say
that
the
child
is
dangerous,
all
he
had
to
say
is
that
the
child
is
mentally
ill
and
suitable
for
treatment.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
sir
he
could
be
an
obstetrician.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
they
do
not.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir
and
i
do
not
think
that,
that
surgery
could
be
authorized
by
anyone
other
than
the
parents
or
if
the
court
found
that
the
parents
were
acting
bad
faith
and
denying
the
child
the
treatment
he
needed
of
course
the
court
could.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
excepted
that
they
would
lose.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
believe
so.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
law
in
georgia
requires
--
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
have
this
specific
cite
i
think
it
is
8819
federal
88
chapter
19,
has
a
consent
law
and
requires
the
consent
of
the
parents
before
medical
treatment
can
be
rendered
to
children.
georgia
code
section
74
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
georgia
code
section
74
of
104
makes
parents
explicitly
responsible
for
the
welfare
and
care
of
their
children
and
i
--
there
is
no
law
that
says
before
a
hospital
can
release
a
patient.
i
am
sorry
i
am
going
around
your
question
sir
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
there
is
no
question
that
i
cannot
say
and
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
law
that
says,
that
with
respect
to
any
facility
a
hospital
has
to
have
parent's
permission,
there
is
a
law
here
that
says
that
if
the
child
wants
to
leave
his
leaving
can
be
conditioned
upon
the
consent
of
his
parents.
in
this
law
suit
there
is
actually
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
similar
requirement
in
a
state
--
medical
treatment
area.
let
me
get
back
to
your
question
or
your
point
mr.
chief
justice.
what
our
point
is,
is
if
we
say
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
here,
then
similarly
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
that
child
who
is
going
to
have
his
tonsils
taken
out.
i
think
we
perhaps
used
a
really
gruesome
example
in
our
reply
brief,
but
i
think
it
is
appropriate
and
that
is
a
situation
where
a
parent
takes
a
child
to
a
physician
and
a
physician
says
your
child
is
exhibiting
signs
of
cancer
the
treatment
for
which
is
the
removal
of
his
leg.
under
the
very
liberal
definition
of
liberty
that
the
district
court
applied,
clearly
the
consequence
is
that
parental
decision
is
going
to
be
to
deprive
the
child
of
his
liberty
again
as
the
district
court
has
defined
it
and
as
the
united
states
noted
in
its
amicus
brief
it
would
be
unprecedented
to
argue
that
the
child
has
a
liberty
right.
a
right
to
due
process
in
that
situation
and
in
fact
no
one
argues
that,
there
are
simply
arguing
that
in
this
particular
case
mental
illness.
this
child
has
a
right
to
due
process.
no
one
argues
that
he
would
have
that
right
in
any
other
area
and
we
suggest
that,
that
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
way
constitutional
rights
have
been
defined.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir,
but
at
the
point
we
are
and
the
argument
right
now,
it
is
our
position
that
a
child
does
not
have
a
liberty
right
at
all.
at
this
point
vis-a-vis
his
parents
not
vis-a-vis
the
state.
constitutional
rights,
i
believe
you
can
say
do
not
exist
in
the
abstract
they
exist
because
of
relationships.
you
might
say
that
there
is
a
constitutional
rights
when
you
got
the
parents
or
the
child
versus
state
as
in
the
case
of
henry
goll,
we
are
talking
about
the
parent
and
the
child
and
the
parent
making
the
decision
for
the
child,
we
say
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
and
that
is
where
the
court
should
have
focused
first
and
did
the
district
court.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
certain
would
not
intend
to
say
that
the
child
does
not
have
any
liberty
interest.
only
a
liberty
interest
not
to
challenge
his
parents
medically
indicated
decisions,
that
is
how
nearly
i
want
to
define
it
and
i
do
not
mean
to
broaden
it
any
more.
however
even
if
the
court
decides
that
in
fact
there
is
a
liberty
interest
here
that
could
be
protected,
the
second
question
is
the
one
that
was
advanced
by
the
court
itself
and
that
is
why
there
is,
whether
or
not
some
state
action
involved
in
this
case.
now
the
best
way
to
address
the
state
action
question
from
our
perceptive
is
to
consider
what
this
court
said
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
and
that
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
case
and
set
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
determine
will
there
be
a
state
action
here.
what
we
can
say
is
that
the
challenge
statute
here
does
not
authorize
parents
to
provide
medically
indicated
treatment
for
their
children.
it
does
not
encourage
it,
we
do
not
go
out
and
seek
the
children.
the
best
characterizations
of
what
we
do
is
we
provide
a
resource
and
that
is
it.
we
provide
resource
just
as
any
private
hospital
would
be
a
resource.
we
simply
are
fulfilling
a
proprietary
function
in
this
case
and
as
i
said
our
position
is,
is
that
it
ought
to
be
looked
at
from
a
practical
stand
point
it
seemed
impractical
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir,
we
will
not.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
way
we
have
characterized
it
is,
that
we
do
in
fact
have
a
gatekeeper.
we
do
in
fact
have
a
gatekeeper.
but
what
we
do
is
we
decide
that
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct.
we
decide
that
the
child
meets
the
criteria
of
being
mentally
ill
and
suitable
for
the
treatment,
but
of
course
that
is
the
same
function
that
any
doctor
provides
in
any
hospital
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
seems
illogical
to
say
that
if
a
parent
has
money,
if
he
has
assets,
if
he
has
resources,
he
can
go
to
a
private
facility
and
if
the
psychiatrist
or
the
physician
or
the
whatever
agrees
with
him,
he
can
put
his
child
in
that
hospital
without
going
to
a
juvenile
court
proceeding.
without
going
through
an
adversarial
hearing,
but
if
he
does
not
have
the
money,
if
he
does
not
have
the
assets,
we
are
going
to
make
him
go
to
an
adversarial
proceeding.
if
he
has
to
go
to
a
juvenile
court
get
a
lawyer,
get
a
lawyer
for
his
child
or
the
court
will
point
him
of
course.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct.
that
is
really
follows
from
what
the
court
said
in
jackson
versus
metropolitan
edison
what
we
are
doing
is
we
are
allowing
a
choice,
that
the
parent
has
to
initiate.
the
parent
has
to
initiate
the
action
or
the
guardian
has
to
initiate
the
action
that
leads
child
to
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
child
receives
absolutely
nothing.
he
does
what
his
parents
tell
him,
and
the
parents
of
course
decide
what
to
do
based
on
the
doctors
advise.
i
think
that
is
our
main
point
that
if
in
that
case
that
parent
can
put
that
child
in
that
hospital,
but
here
he
is
going
to
have
go
through
an
adversarial
process
to
achieve
the
same
result
which
is
simply
to
get
mental
health
treatment
for
his
mentally
ill
child.
the
set
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
and
i
think
that
the
law
would
allow
you
to
challenge
the
place
and
the
reason
for
your
attention
even
in
a
private
facility.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
he
would
certainly
have
a
false
imprisonment
suit
against
the
physician.
he
could
not
sue
his
parents
in
georgia.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
discrimination
that
i
was
addressing
if
it
exist
at
all
is
one
based
on
wealth
of
course
and
it
is
simply
the
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
if
the
district
court
orders
stands
unchanged
that
will
be
not
be
the
instance
with
respect
to
the
public
hospitals,
they
will
continue
to
be
so
with
the
private
hospitals.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
them
to
change
the
as
they
are
(ph).
the
second
issue
with
the
respect
to
state
action
of
course
is
what
happens
once
the
child
is
in.
i
just
want
to
briefly
touch
that
and
make
the
point
that
we
made
in
our
brief
that
our
position
is,
is
that
once
that
child
is
in
the
facility
as
long
as
he
continues
to
meet
the
minimum
criteria,
we
simply
act
as
does
any
custodian
of
the
child,
that
the
parents
has
entrusted
his
child
to,
we
release
the
child
when
the
parents
wants
the
child.
we
do
not
release
the
parent
--
assuming
these
minimal
conditions
are
met
with
the
child,
if
parent
wants
the
child
to
stay
in.
even
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
state
action
here
of
course,
we
still
got
the
issue
of
what
process
is
due.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
concede
state
action.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
well
sir,
if
i
lose
the
argument
on
the
children
who
are
placed
by
state
agencies
and
prevail
on
the
state
action
on
those
children
that
are
not
i
would
have
succeeded
since
the
vast
majority
are
admitted
by
their
parents.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
would
say
that,
that
is
of
course
state
action.
i
would
say
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
necessary
to
implicate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
cannot
deny,
that
a
state
action
of
the
state
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
there
is
a
different
level
a
different
quantum
of
state
action,
but
yes
sir,
state
action
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
assuming
it
is
a
deprivation
it
cannot
be
accomplished
without
the
physician's
approval.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
am
saying
that
all
–
it
is
not
a
progression,
the
parent
has
already
decided
that
the
child
needs
to
be
in
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct,
but
what
the
state
is
doing
is
the
state
is
saying,
it
is
simply
affirming
the
parent's
decision.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
agree,
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it
makes
the
state
action
very
difficult.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
they
do
not
let
them;
that
is
correct
they
treat
them,
they
treat
them.
even
if
you
find
that
there
is
liberty
in
state
action
the
question
is
what
process
is
due.
our
position
on
this
is
similar
to
judge
relling's
(ph)
and
his
opinion
in
drummond
versus
fulton
county
department
of
family
&
children's
services
where
he
said
due
process
does
not
require
in
every
instance
an
adversarial
proceeding.
it
simply
requires
rational
decision
making
process.
in
this
case
what
happens
is,
a
parent
decides
that
a
child
is
mentally
ill
for
one
reason
or
the
another.
he
decides
because
of
the
child's
odd
(ph)
behavior,
he
decides
it
because
physician
tells
him
so.
he
brings
the
child
to
a
hospital
and
i
am
simplifying
the
procedure,
the
record
clearly
discloses
that
almost
uniformly
children
are
taken
from
the
parents
to
the
community
mental
health
centers
and
if
they
can
be
treated
as
outpatients
they
are
treated
there
and
then
only
if
that
fails
they
are
brought
to
the
hospital,
but
i
am
simplifying
it
just
for
explanation.
they
bring
the
child
to
the
hospital,
the
record
clearly
discloses
that
at
the
hospital
the
child
is
examined
by
a
team.
they
use
a
team
approach
which
may
include
a
psychiatrist,
a
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
that
is
correct
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
i
do
not
deny
that.
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
they
–
it
is
a
team
approach
when
they
come
to
the
hospital,
you
have
got
as
i
said
psychiatrist,
psychologists
social
workers,
mental
health
therapist
who
the
record
discloses
contacts
schools
or
community,
the
courts,
the
police
to
try
to
get
a
picture,
they
talk
to
the
child,
they
talk
to
his
parents
and
then
they
decide
to
admit
it
and
that
is
probably
our
biggest
difficulty
here.
it
just
seems
that
is
clearly
a
rational
decision
making
process.
that
state
has
no
stage
in
admitting
the
child,
there
is
no
proof
that
the
child
or
that
the
state
gets
anything
if
the
child
is
admitted.
the
records
clear
that
we
do
not
operate
capacity
in
our
hospitals.
the
records
is
replete
with
evidence
on
that
basis.
but
even
if
the
child
is
mistakenly
hospitalized,
even
if
the
child's
parents
have
the
wrong
motives
to
bring
that
child
to
the
hospital,
even
if
the
doctors
just
completely
do
the
wrong
thing
and
admit
the
child,
the
child
still
has
access
to
the
courts
and
i
think
that,
that
ought
to
be
considered,
it
has
not
been
considered
yet.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
of
course
they
have
habeas
corpus,
but
that
is
not
what
they
need
to
rely
on.
there
are
specific
provision
in
georgia
code
chapter
88
filed
at
the
mental
health
code
that
the
children
or
that
any
patient
can
go
to
the
probate
court
of
the
county
and
claim
that
the
chapter
is
being
abused.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
well,
your
honor
i
do
not
want
to
appear
flip
with
my
answer,
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
its
decision
in
bellotti
versus
baird
where
the
court
of
course
had
an
abortion
decision
but
the
massachusetts
statute
said
that
parents
could
be
required
to
consent
to
the
abortion
of
--
a
child
could
be
required
to
get
his
parents
consent,
but
if
the
child
could
not
get
his
parents
consent
it
could
then
go
to
the
courts
and
get
an
order.
she
could
then
go
to
the
courts
and
get
an
order
authorizing
the
abortion
and
it
would
appear
that
the
ten,
eleven,
twelve
year
old
child
who
is
in
this
case
would
get
to
court
the
same
way
the
ten,
eleven,
twelve,
thirteen
year
old
girl
would
get
court
in
bellotti.
the
statute,
that
the
child
need
not
rely
especially
on
that.
there
is
also
the
provision
in
the
court
that
requires
dhr
to
provide
access
to
counsel
if
the
patients
need
it.
the
record
will
disclose
and
i
do
not
think
the
appellee's
dispute
that
we
provide
an
office
space
for
these
attorney's
in
our
mental
health
facility
and
that
it
was
our
staff
that
referred
these
children
to
these
lawyers.
i
think
that
the
system
in
its
totality
demonstrates
the
children
cannot
get
into
court.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
but
you
can
not
mandamus
someone
to
perform
a
discretionary
function
and
that
is
what
this
would
be.
they
could
mandamus
him
to
perhaps
examine
the
child
but
they
could
not
mandamus
him
to
admit
him.
there
is
one
issue
that
i
do
not
want
to
get
away
from,
i
do
not
want
to
sit
down
without
addressing
it
and
that
is
the
substantive
due
process
issue
because
that
--
i
know
i
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
when
the
procedural
question
--
but
that
is
the
nut
of
this
case;
that
is
why
this
case
was
brought
in
the
first
instance
and
we
think
that
the
district
court's
decision
there
was
incorrect
and
has
to
be
reversed.
what
the
district
court
has
said
us
in
this
substantive
due
process
question,
is
that
if
a
parent
brings
a
child
to
a
state
mental
hospital
and
our
physician
examines
that
child
and
he
says,
“this
child
is
mentally
ill,
i
can
treat
him
in
my
hospital,
i
can
give
him
some
benefit,
but
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
give
him
or
i
would
send
him
to
group
home
or
specialized
foster
home,
then
we
cannot
provide
treatment
for
that
child
if
we
do
not
have
that
specialized
foster
home
or
that
group
home.
what
the
district
court
has
said
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
provide
treatment
for
these
children,
we
have
to
provide
the
treatment
in
the
most
appropriate
treatment
setting
and
if
we
do
not
have
it
we
can
not
provide
the
treatment.
now
the
absurdity
of
this
is
that
if
a
parent,
if
an
adult
rather
comes
to
our
hospital,
he
has
got
schizophrenia,
paranoid
type,
even
if
he
is
not
appropriate
for
hospitalization
in
this
case
they
have
adult
foster
homes.
even
if
he
is
not
appropriate
for
hospitalization,
he
can
go
into
that
hospital
because
he
has
presumed
to
be
able
to
assume
the
risk
of
going
into
the
hospital.
but
under
the
districts
court's
decision,
if
a
child
comes
to
that
hospital
with
that
exact
same
condition,
we
cannot
put
that
child
in
the
hospital,
his
parents
cannot
waive
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
districts
court's
opinion
and
that
child
will
go
without
a
treatment
until
that
child
either
degenerates
the
point
where
hospitalization
is
appropriate
or
until
the
parent
is
able
to
find
some
private
care
for
him.
and
it
just
does
not
seem
to
be
a
logical
result
to
us
and
it
is
certainly
one
that
should
not
be
allowed
in
this
case.
it
just
is
a
result
that
should
be
avoided
and
i
know
when
our
reply
brief
i
accused
the
i
think
it
is
perhaps
the
wrong
word,
but
i
mentioned
a
parade
of
horribles
and
i
do
not
want
the
court
to
think
that,
that
is
what
i
am
doing
here.
any
fair
reading
of
that
district
court's
decision,
particularly
when
coupled
with
the
order
denying
the
stay,
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
district
court
said
i
find
that
every
moment
of
inappropriate
hospitalization
of
a
child
denies
that
child
a
substantive
due
process
interest.
every
moment
of
inappropriate
hospitalization
and
he
has
found
that
it
was
inappropriate
when
we
could
think
of
some
other
treatment
setting
that
was
more
appropriate.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
we
can
do
that.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
but
we
do
have
a
slight
problem.
some
of
the
46
children
that
were
at
issue
here
are
already
in
our
custody
and
that
is
why
this
issue
is
not
--
is
right,
i
know
this
several
amici
suggested
that
it
is
not,
but
they
obviously
would
not
be
aware
of
this
thing
that
we
do
have
custody
of
certain
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
most
appropriate
treatment
setting
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cause
of
this
case
is
here
for
reargument
and
i
realized
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
this
case.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
begin
by
simply
setting
the
issues
before
the
court
and
proceeding
directly
to
my
argument.
at
issue
in
this
litigation
of
course
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
georgia's
statute
which
recognizes
the
rights
of
parents
of
mentally
ill
children
to
make
application
for
admission
for
those
children
to
state
mental
health
facilities.
the
statute
was
attacked
on
essentially
two
grounds.
the
appellees
argued
that
children
have
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
and
that
this
statute
which
authorizes
their
hospitalization
without
prior
notice
in
hearing
deprives
them
of
that
liberty
interest
for
that
due
process
of
law.
second,
the
appellees
argued
and
the
district
court
found
that
children
who
are
mentally
ill
and
who
receive
treatment
from
the
state
have
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
treatment
for
their
mental
illness
and
only
that
treatment
setting
which
is
most
appropriate
to
their
condition.
turning
to
the
first
issue,
the
foremost
and
threshold
question
which
should
have
been
addressed
in
the
district
court
and
wasn't
was
an
examination
of
the
interest
sought
to
be
protected
to
see
whether
in
fact
it
has
a
constitutional
dimension.
that
is,
do
children
have
a
constitutional
right
to
challenge
the
medically
indicated
decisions
of
their
parents?
what
the
district
court
did
was
simply
look
and
see
that
parent's
makes
decisions
or
their
children
and
as
a
result
of
this
decision-making
process,
that
often
times
the
child
is
subjected
to
potentially
grievous
injury.
here,
hospitalization
as
the
district
court
characterized
it.
and
what
he
said
was
--
what
the
district
court
said
was,
is
that
because
of
the
injury
here
this
children
or
this
parental
decision
making
process
can
only
be
done
in
a
constitutionally
permissible
fashion.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
point
where
the
district
court
made
the
error
upon
which
its
entire
opinion
was
predicated.
it
is
our
position
that
a
proper
analysis
of
this
case
should
have
begun
with
the
parent-guardian
and
child
relationship.
it's
our
position
that
based
on
this
court's
previous
decision
as
well
as
the
history
of
our
western
civilization
that
we
have
decided
and
by
we,
i
mean
society
and
not
the
state,
that
we
have
decided
that
there
are
certain
decisions
that
children
cannot
make
for
themselves,
that
there
are
certain
decisions
that
an
adult
has
to
make
for
a
child.
and
among
these
decisions
are
medically
indicated
decisions
with
very
few
exceptions.
that
is,
it's
our
position
that
in
our
society
parents
with
the
advice
of
a
physician
routinely
make
decisions
which
range
from
whether
a
child
is
to
have
a
tonsillectomy
to
decisions
which
have
life
and
death
consequences
for
the
child.
one
example
which
i'd
like
to
use
is
the
situation
where
the
parents
faced
with
the
child
who
has
a
heart
defect,
the
young
child.
and
a
doctor
says
of
course
the
child
can
live
without
an
operation.
the
child
will
be
an
invalid
for
his
or
her
entire
life.
i
can
operate.
if
the
operation
is
successful,
the
child
will
live
a
normal
life.
if
the
operation
is
not
successful,
the
child
would
die.
that
kind
of
decision,
that
kind
of
life
and
death
decision-making
process
occurs
in
the
family
routinely
and
yet
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
that
kind
of
a
decision
which
clearly
could
have
the
consequences
which
are
much
more
adverse
that
what
we
have
here.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
successfully
except
in
a
few
recent
district
court
decisions
that
that
kind
of
a
decision-making
process
is
required
to
be
subjected
to
an
advisory
proceeding
such
as
what
was
mandated
here
by
this
district
court
decision.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
believe,
sir,
that
it
would
prohibit
it
to
the
extent
that
the
state
did
not
have
a
compelling
state
interest
to
interfere
with
the
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
sir,
absolute
showing
of
the
compelling
state
interest
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
sir
--
i
--
yes,
sir.
our
analysis
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
sir,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
would
be
not
--
it
would
not
be
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
state
to
interfere
with
the
family
and
that
situation
have
some
demonstration
of
a
compelling
state
constitution.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
certainly
could.
there's
a
--
i
believe
i
could,
perhaps
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
one,
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
see
that
the
second
point
would
be
easier
and
i
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
all,
yes
sir.
that
would
resolve
this
case
from
that
standpoint,
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
i
--
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
don't
really
--
i
wouldn't
maintain
that.
i
think
that
what
my
difficulty
here
is
that
it
was
our
original
position
that
the
issue
here
was
not
constitutionally
based
that
it
was
--
that
we
were
tying
everything
here
to
a
parent
acting
on
medical
advice
and
assuming
and
stating
that
that
was
something
which
should
have
been
reserved
to
the
family
which
we
could
not
constitutionally
interfere.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
absolutely
correct,
sir.
either
for
the
reason
that
the
child
does
not
have
a
liberty
interest
or
if
the
child
does
have
a
liberty
interest
in
this
particular
situation
because
the
process
which
we
provide
them
meets
all
the
basic
requirements
that
the
constitution
would
mandate.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no,
sir,
it's
our
position
that
the
confinement
is
secondary
to
in
an
unnecessary
incident
with
a
treatment.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
that's
our
--
that's
what
my
first
--
my
first
position
is
that
in
this
case
where
the
parent
makes
the
decision
and
there
is
confinement,
as
necessary
result
that
decision
that
the
child
does
not
have
a
liberty
interest.
it's
our
position
that
constitutional
rights
arise
out
of
relationship.
and
the
relationship
that
is
here
is
between
parent
and
child,
not
between
the
child
and
the
state
as
in
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
not
in
the
constitutional
sense.
there
--
certainly
the
child
is
restrained
in
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
that
was
my
point
exactly
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
evidently
wasn't
answering
his
question
that
the
confinement
in
the
hospital
is
just
a
necessary
incident
to
the
--
incidental
to
the
treatment
itself
and
it
occurs
very
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
a
difficult
position
to
maintain,
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
and
i
don't
believe
i
could
maintain
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
and
we
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
there
is
certainly
a
difference
in
terms
of
duration.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
well,
from
a
tonsillectomy,
you
of
course
--
could
sir
that
the
next
day
i
supposed
but
from
an
open
heart
surgery
for
instance,
you
couldn't.
it's
just
a
question
with
degree.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
i
think
the
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
all
right.
i
believe,
sir
that
children
who
go
to
other
types
of
hospitals
for
other
kinds
of
surgery
or
just
as
restrain
as
the
children
are
in
these
cases
who
go
to
mental
hospitals.
now,
perhaps
the
duration
is
different.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
the
resolution
of
the
liberty
question
of
course
does
not
end
the
case
except
of
course
if
you
find
a
liberty
interest.
but
before
we
can
get
to
the
question
of
what
processes
do,
we
have
the
court's
question
of
whether
this
case
implicates
or
has
that
quantum
of
state
action
necessary
to
implicate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
position
on
this
is
simply
that
due
process
is
an
amorphous
concept
and
perhaps
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it
is
that
it
requires
a
case
by
case
examination.
it's
our
position
that
in
this
case,
what
we
have
is
we
have
private
parties
here,
parents
availing
themselves
of
a
resource
from
the
state
which
is
substantially
identical
to
a
resource
which
could
be
provided
and
could
be
obtained
in
the
private
sector.
and
that
it
is
--
perhaps
we
can
best
state
it
by
saying
illogical
to
have
a
decision
where
the
result
is
simply
to
create
two
classes
of
parents.
one
class
of
parents
who
buy
their
wealth
or
buy
reason
of
their
wealth
and
their
assets
and
the
finances
that
they
have
can
go
to
a
private
facility
and
can
avoid
all
of
the
process
which
has
been
mandated
by
the
district
court.
and
have
another
class
of
parents
who
because
of
their
poverty
or
their
inability
to
pay
and
who
are
therefore
forced
to
rely
upon
the
state
for
their
--
treatment
for
their
children,
that
these
parents
have
to
go
through
an
adversarial
proceeding
such
as
that
mandated
by
the
district
court
in
order
to
simply
obtain
mental
health
treatment
for
their
child.
of
course
this
has
another
aspect
too.
the
essence
of
state
action
here
if
you
find
it
is
that
the
hospitals,
the
state
facility
and
that
the
physician
who
is
--
the
psychiatrist
in
this
case
but
the
physician
who
is
authorizing
the
admission
is
a
state
employee.
if
that
is
sufficient
to
create
state
action,
then
this
means
that
in
all
of
our
public
hospitals
in
the
state
of
georgia
as
elsewhere
that
the
admission
of
any
child
to
a
state
hospital
for
any
reason
is
state
action
and
the
question
thereafter
always
be
whether
the
risk
of
deprivation
that
flows
from
that
is
sufficient
to
warrant
some
sort
of
hearing.
and
of
course
numerous
medical
treatments
as
i
have
indicated
previously
have
potential
consequences
which
are
certainly
as
grievous
as
this.
we
simply
cite
that
we've
believe
--
or
we
simply
state
to
the
court
that
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
logic
where
we
simply
offer
a
choice
that
that
is
not
a
sufficient
amount
of
state
action
to
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
but
--
no,
sir.
if
i
said
that
i
should
not
--
you
would
in
those
instances
have
to
provide
whatever
minimum
amount
of
due
process
this
court
or
other
courts
would
deem
necessary
which
brings
me
really
to
the
due
process
question
which
is
raised
when
you
find
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
when
you
find
there
is
state
action.
the
analysis
which
we
have
used
is
the
analysis
set
forth
by
this
court
in
mathews
v.
eldridge
which
of
course
is
a
three-step
process
requiring
an
examination
of
the
interest
of
the
parties
as
a
second
step
when
evaluation
of
the
risk
of
error
under
the
present
procedures
as
well
as
an
evaluation
of
the
benefits
of
additional
procedures.
and
thirdly,
an
examination
of
the
burdens
imposed
on
the
state
by
these
additional
procedures.
i've
already
spoken
about
the
first
issue,
the
interest
involved
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
second
issue.
in
order
to
understand
the
resolution
of
this,
i
believe
that
i
have
to
explain
to
the
court
how
we
perceive
that
the
system
works
in
georgia
now
and
how
it
does
work
indeed
at
the
time
of
this
litigation
for
we
believe
that
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
drummond
versus
fulton
county
department
of
family
and
children
services,
due
process
only
requires
a
rational
decision
making
process.
in
georgia,
under
our
statutes,
the
parent
first
makes
a
decision
that
the
child
is
mentally
ill
either
because
they've
had
the
advice
of
a
physician
or
because
they
notice
some
aberrant
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
child
or
i
suppose
for
a
number
of
other
reasons.
normally,
although
admittedly
not
always,
the
parent
takes
the
child
then
to
the
community
mental
health
center
where
the
child
is
examined
and
if
found
to
be
mentally
ill,
where
the
child
is
treated
if
that's
possible.
that
is
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
parent
taking
the
child
to
the
community
health
center.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
it
is
all
parent
or
guardian
initiated.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it
is
the
parent's
decision
to
take
the
child
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
only
place
that
the
state
would
become
involved
other
than
where
the
state
is
a
guardian
is
where
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
our
juvenile
court
system
that
the
child
was
mentally
ill
and
not
receiving
proper
treatment
in
which
case
it
could
be
taken
into
juvenile
court,
the
state
could
take
it
in.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
a
petition
in
the
juvenile
court
which
can
be
filed
under
our
law
by
any
person
alleging
that
the
child
has
been
deprived.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
a
neighbor,
a
welfare
worker
if
you
will,
someone
from
the
local
mental
health
agency
could
do
it.
under
georgia
law,
the
specific
dictates
any
person
can
file
that
petition
in
juvenile
court.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
i
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
what
--
the
way
i
prefaced
it
was
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
if
the
parent
believes
the
child
is
mentally
ill
because
a
doctor
has
told
them
so,
physicians
told
them
so,
or
because
he
notices
some
aberrant
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
child,
i've
thought
i
had
said
that.
if
i
didn't,
i
should
have.
but,
at
any
event
the
child
at
the
first
level
is
treated
in
the
community
if
that's
possible
in
most
circumstances.
and
then
and
only
then
if
that
fails
is
the
child
taken
to
the
community
--
to
the
mental
health
center,
to
the
hospital
if
you
will
and
there
the
child
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
state
of
georgia
has
approximately
50
minimum
community
mental
health
centers
where
children
can
be
treated
as
outpatients.
to
demonstrate
the
scope
of
this,
in
1974,
fiscal
year
1974
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
usually,
but
as
i
want
to
caveat
that
by
saying
not
always,
i
wouldn't
want
to
mislead
the
court
on
that
point.
usually,
the
parent
takes
the
child
to
community
mental
health
centers.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
those
are
state-paid
generally
mental
health
professionals.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes,
sir,
they
have
a
--
it's
my
understanding
and
i
just
quite
frankly
don't
believe
the
makeup
of
that
team
is
in
the
record
but
it's
my
understanding
that
they
have
a
full
range
of
mental
health
services
that
they
provide
in
the
community.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
generally
sir,
it's
what
the
record
reveals.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
then
if
the
child
can
be
--
the
child
is
treated
in
the
community
either
at
home
as
an
outpatient
or
through
whatever
local
facilities
they
have
in
the
community,
group
homes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
they're
state-paid
or
county-paid
mental
health
professionals,
psychiatrists,
psychologists,
social
workers.
it's
my
understanding
again
is
that
it's
the
full
gambit
of
mental
health
professionals.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
then
the
child
is
referred
to
the
state
mental
health
facility,
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no
sir,
there
are
eight
regional
hospitals
in
the
state
of
georgia,
seven
of
which
have
been
built
--
well,
have
been
built
within
a
ten
years
proceeding,
this
litigation.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
those
are
mental
hospitals,
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
they
do
confine
the
patients
there.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
when
the
child
is
referred
to
a
hospital,
he
is
again
evaluated
by
a
team
of
mental
health
professionals
which
the
record
indicates,
are
psychiatrists,
psychologists,
social
workers.
one
even
had
a
director
of
education
in
those
evaluations.
that's
a
separate
evaluation
and
it's
only
at
that
point
when
that
team
makes
a
separate
determination
if
the
child
is
mentally
ill
or
chose
evidence
of
mental
illness
and
a
suitable
for
treatment
in
the
hospital
that
the
child
is
admitted
to
the
hospital.
so,
our
position
in
this
respect
is
that
there's
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
admitted.
we
treat
it
as
a
voluntary
admission.
he
is
not
committed.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
under
our
statute,
if
the
parent
say
using
a
hypothetical
decides
that
the
child
will
not
go
in
the
hospital,
say
that
the
child
has
been
brought
to
the
hospital
and
evaluated
and
the
doctors
want
to
admit
him.
and
the
parent
decides
not
to
admit
him,
then
the
child
is
not
admitted
unless
the
state
can
go
through
the
juvenile
court
proceeding
or
to
the
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
to
get
the
child
in.
the
parent
holds
the
string
so
to
speak,
not
to
get
him
in
because
that
takes
to
initiate
getting
him
in
of
course
but
not
to
physically
get
him
in
because
that
of
course
relies
on
a
medical
determination.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
there
--
by
questioning,
you
mean
appeal
to
a
judicial
body.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
well,
we
believed
that
each
succeeding
step
access
a
check
on
the
previous
one
of
course,
that
is
the
parent
makes
the
initial
determination.
usually,
the
community
mental
health
center
makes
the
second
stage
of
the
determination,
of
course
if
this
child
is
not
mentally
ill
there,
they
don't
get
into
the
system.
and
thirdly,
the
hospital
checks
the
community
and
the
parents
so
we
contend
that
each
succeeding
level
is
in
fact
almost
a
form
of
appeal
if
you
will.
and
of
course
not
only
do
they
have
this
but
there
is
a
provision
under
our
law
for
access
to
the
courts
in
georgia
for
these
children.
we
have
a
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
at
any
stage
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
let
me
explain.
i
want
to
be
very
careful
again
about
this.
we
have
a
state
statute
that
require
the
department
of
human
resources
to
see
that
all
patients
have
access
to
counsel
for
assistance
in
legal
matters
in
which
they
are
involved.
we
have
statutes
that
provide
three
courts
that
these
children
can
go
to.
and
i
hadn't
thought
of
it
as
being
at
any
stage
of
their
commitment
but
i
know
no
reason
why
it
could
not
be.
that
is
the
children
can
go
to
the
superior
court
on
a
writ
which
of
course
anyone
could
do
in
any
situation
like
this.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
a
habeas,
yes
sir.
second,
the
mental
health
code
or
georgia
mental
health
code
specifically
provides
that
the
probate
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
cases
of
people
in
state
mental
health
facilities
to
make
sure
the
provisions
of
the
mental
health
code
are
being
complied
with.
and
thirdly,
with
respect
to
children,
they
have
access
to
the
juvenile
court
which
of
course
has
jurisdiction
over
children
placed
in
violation
of
law
over
children
who
have
been
abandoned
and
over
children
who
are
deprived
which
is
defined
as
--
you
know,
not
receiving
proper
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
okay.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
that
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
question
that
you
could
ask
and
my
answer
to
you
is
that
i
can
only
illuminate
it
by
this
case.
and
that
--
in
this
case,
it
was
our
staff
that
referred
these
children
to
their
lawyers.
it
was
our
department
of
human
resources
to
furnish
office
space
in
our
hospital
to
these
lawyers.
i
would
submit
that
an
examination
of
the
district
court
order
in
this
case
does
not
reveal
that
so
much
as
a
single
child
had
ever
been
inappropriately
hospitalized
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
we
have
two
things
that
i
can
offer
in
response
to
that.
i
don't
know
it's
satisfactory
but
we
have
an
advocacy
unit
within
the
department
itself
that
advocates
for
patients.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
we
have
--
at
the
hospitals,
we
have
two
things.
we
have
a
pamphlet
that
every
patient
receives.
it's
a
handbook
on
patient's
rights
which
is
--
i
don't
know
how
to
describe
it
to
you.
the
appellees
asked
one
of
our
witnesses
whether
it
was
written
in
children's
language
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
is
but
it's
written
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it's
written
in
section
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not
sir
but
i
think
in
that
case
an
adult
is
going
to
have
to
make
the
decision
for
the
child
in
any
event.
and
i
think
that
this
case
demonstrates
that
our
mental
health
people
there
in
the
hospital
when
it's
appropriate
do
in
fact
refer
patients
who
don't
need
to
be
in
the
hospital
and
their
opinion
to
lawyers.
that
really
is
the
due
process
that
we
see
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
the
voluntary
commitment
of
an
adult
requires
only
--
only
that
the
--
no,
that's
not
--
that's
how
i
read
the
--
the
adult
normally
goes
to
the
community
also.
we
have
a
community
based
program
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
no
person
in
georgia
is
deemed
to
be
incompetent
unless
he's
been
judicially
--
has
been
adjudicated
incompetent.
we
presume
that
they're
all
competent
to
seek
admission
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct
sir
because
being
admitted
as
a
voluntary
patient
requires
only
that
you'd
be
mentally
ill
and
suitable
for
treatment
in
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
it
requires
no
dangerousness
or
a
finding
of
inability
to
care
for
yourself
which
really
gets
to
the
incompetency
question.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that
is
initiated
by
the
adult,
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
he
goes
to
the
hospital
or
he
goes
to
the
community
mental
health
center.
he
goes
to
the
community
mental
health
center,
they
try
to
treat
him
in
the
community.
if
they
can't
treat
him
there,
he
goes
to
the
hospital.
and
if
he
comes
to
the
hospital
and
says,
”i'm
sick
and
i
want
in.”
and
the
doctor
examines
him
and
says,
“yes,
you're
showing
evidence
of
mental
illness
and
we
think
we
can
treat
you
here.”
he's
admitted
to
the
hospital.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
its
--
yes,
yes
sir,
he
does
and
also
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
and
of
course
he
has
one
more.
an
adult
can
walkout.
that
is,
he
can
say,
“i
want
to
leave.”
and
the
state
either
has
to
release
him
or
has
to
begin
involuntary
commitment
proceedings
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir,
with
the
one
difference
that
you've
just
noted.
if
the
parents
says,
”i
want
to
leave.”
then
the
dismissal
of
the
child
would
of
course
be
conditioned
on
his
parent's
approval
of
that
discharge.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
now
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
that's
precisely
it.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
a
person
under
the
age
of
18
years.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
no,
if
he's
18,
he's
an
adult,
he's
18.
it's
under
18
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
he
becomes
an
adult
on
his
18th
birthday.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
as
long
as
i
can
caveat
that
by
saying
we
admit
at
the
request
of
the
parents
but
only
after
our
doctors
have
said,
“the
child
is
mentally
ill
and
suitable
for
treatment.”
there
is
another
part
of
that
test
and
that
is
of
course
the
benefits
of
the
adverse
procedures
advocated
here.
i
think
that
we
have
addressed
them
on
our
brief
unless
the
court
would
like
me
to
discuss
them
because
i
would
like
to
turn
just
briefly
to
the
other
issue
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
district
court's
mandating
that
we
provide
treatment
for
these
mentally
ill
children
in
only
the
most
appropriate
treatment
setting.
the
--
what
the
district
court
found
because
we
told
the
district
court
that
there
are
certain
children
who
are
in
the
hospital,
who
are
mentally
ill
but
for
whom
there
--
are
conceivable
other
types
of
treatment
settings,
group
homes
and
this
sort
of
thing.
going
from
this,
the
district
court
mandated
that
we
--
the
discharge
these
children,
in
particular
this
46
but
of
course
it
applies
to
all
children
similarly
situated,
either
discharge
these
children
from
our
custody
or
provide
for
them
the
most
appropriate
treatment
setting
conceivable.
that
is
the
best
treatment
setting.
i
bring
this
to
the
court
because
we
think
this
is
perhaps
as
important
as
the
other
issue,
maybe
even
more
important
because
what
the
district
court
has
said
in
essence
is
that
if
i
or
anyone
takes
their
child
to
a
state
mental
health
facility
and
the
doctor
there
says,
“you're
child
is
sick.
i
can
treat
your
child
here
in
the
hospital
and
he'll
get
benefits
from
it.”
but
if
i
had
my
preference,
i'd
like
to
have
him
in
a
group
home.
and
there
isn't
any
group
home
for
that
child
and
under
this
district
court
decision,
that
child
cannot
be
admitted
to
a
state
mental
health
facility.
and
of
course
if
we
have
no
group
home,
we
can't
go
there
which
means
it's
going
to
be
under
this
decision
in
our
opinion
and
we
think
it's
an
escapable
conclusion.
there
are
going
to
be
children
who
are
mentally
ill
who
are
not
going
to
get
treatment
for
their
mental
illness
in
a
timely
fashion.
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
that
we
provided
these
children
with
the
most
appropriate
treatment
setting
which
we
had
available
at
the
time,
that
is
there
was
no
finding
and
no
evidence
that
we
have
wrongfully
kept
many
child
in
the
hospital
when
we
had
another
treatment
setting
which
anyone
thought
or
physicians
thought
were
more
appropriate
for
him.
this
mandate
by
the
district
court
is
simply
going
to
result
in
us
being
unable
to
serve
the
children
to
the
limited
extent
that
we
already
do.
and
for
this
reason,
we
urge
the
court
to
overturn
that
portion
of
the
decision
as
well.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
this
law
suit
only
involves
the
mentally
ill.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
case
sir
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
correct
for
the
reason
that
if
the
child
is
no
longer
ill,
the
superintendents
under
a
duty
to
discharge
him
from
the
hospital
and
thus
holding
him
when
he
is
no
longer
mentally
ill
which
of
course
is
not
the
facts
in
this
case
but
holding
him
when
he
was
no
longer
mentally
ill
would
be
illegally
detaining
him.
so,
i
cannot
cite
you
to
you
to
a
case
but
we
believe
that
a
habeas
would
lie.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
if
--
i'll
have
to
assume
several
facts
with
your
question.
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
but
if
he
is
not
mentally
ill
and
not
suitable
for
treatment
in
the
hospital,
then
the
superintendent
can't
hold
him.
the
only
way
the
superintendent
can
hold
him
in
that
instance
is
when
the
alternatives
that
are
available
would
threaten
his
safety
which
means
in
your
hypothetical
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
i
cannot
cite
you
--
mr.
r.
douglas
lackey
yes
sir.
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
case
but
i
believe
as
i
understand
habeas
that
would
have
to
be
the
case.
thank
you.
