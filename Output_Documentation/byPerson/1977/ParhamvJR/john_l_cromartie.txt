mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
very
narrow
although
difficult,
i
would
like
in
my
argument
to
deal
first
with
the
procedural
due
process
issue
and
then
deal
with
the
substantive
due
process
issue
if
the
court
will
permit
it.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
right
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
process
of
examination
by
the
superintendent
is
inadequate
as
a
due
process
substitute
for
several
reasons
first
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
we
feel
that
for
several
reason
though
it
is
inadequate.
first
of
all
it
is
not
really
a
hearing
at
all
it
is
not
processed
there,
there
is
no
notice
to
the
child
of
what
will
happen
during
this
interview.
there
is
no
requirement
of
looking
at
other
resources
in
the
test
under
the
georgia
law.
virtually
all
of
the
information
comes
from
the
parents
and
later
in
my
argument
i
will
develop
the
conflicts
of
interest
inherent
between
the
parent
and
the
child,
that
information
is
unverified
and
frequently
inadequate
that
comes
through
that
process
in
essence
there
is
no
structure
whatsoever.
secondly--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
we
feel
that
there
are
substantial,
there
is
a
substantial
chance
that
there
are
conflicts
of
interest
between
parent
and
child
inherently,
yes
your
honor
and
i
can
get
into
that
argument
there
and
jump
from
the
superintendent's
argument.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
superintendent's
decision
though
is
inadequate
for
number
of
other
reasons.
the
state
has
contented
that
the
informality
is
adequate
because
of
a
comprehensive
screening
process
that
happens
prior
to
coming
to
the
hospital.
the
state's
own
witnesses
established
that,
that
screening
process
is
inadequate
dr.
filley
testified
that
it
is
not
mandatory
that,
that
screening
process
can
be
and
is
some
times
ignored.
dr.
filley
testifies
that
the
development
of
community
screening
resources
are
lagging
far
behind
those
of
adult
and
finally
you
have
the
fact
involving
j.l.
and
j.r.
both
of
them
were
screened
by
a
community
screening
process
and
yet
and
the
recommendation
of
their
therapist
was,
was
that
they
should
not
be
hospitalized
and
yet
that
recommendation
was
not
even
considered
by
the
admitting
physician
and
i
think
that
those
facts
go
to
show
how
inadequate
that
community
screening
process
is.
next
we
are
relying
on
the
fact
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
diagnosis
that
this
court
has
noted
before
in
terms
of
psychiatrist
the
tentativeness
of
professional
judgment
we
have
expert
witnesses
who
testify
to
the
institutional
biases,
that
are
reflected
through
the
decision
of
institutional
psychiatrist
and
finally
the
district
court
went
to
these
facilities
looked
at
the
admissions
process.
and
they
found
that
the
admission
process
as
setup
does
not
provide
due
process
protection
so
for
all
of
those
reasons
we
do
not
feel
that
the
superintendent
decision
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
do
not
know
of
know
of
any
interviews
that
they
sat
in
on
all
three
judges
judge
bell,
judge
buddle
(ph),
judge
owens
visited
two
of
the
facilities
one
at
the
choice
of
the
defendant
and
one
at
the
choice
of
the
plaintiff
and
they
state
in
there
decision
that
during
those
days
that
they
were
visiting
the
facilities
if
they
talk
with
state
employees
and
talk
with
patients
and
during
that
process
talked
about
the
admissions,
procedures,
about
the
treatment
in
there
all
of
this
issues,
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
thing
in
the
record
to
indicated
that
they
actually
sit
in
on
the
interview
themselves.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
other
than
the
exchanges
that
occurred
during
the
hearings,
there
were
several
hearings
that
took
place,
but
there
was
no
right
to
cross
examine
the
judge.
i
know
of
no
such
right.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yeah,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue,
but
if
the
court
decides
to
reach
the
issue
we
think
that
at
least
some
sort
of
deliberations
some
impartial
hearing
examiner
whether
they
be
judge
or
whether
they
be
other
professional
might
well
suffice
we
focus
in
on
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
perhaps
could
even
be
state
psychiatrist,
we
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
you
have
state
psychiatrist
in
the
same
institution
and
dr.
messinger
(ph)
testified
very
clearly
that
there
institutional
biases
that
work
there
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
the
testimony
was
from
dr.
messinger
was
that
frequently
psychiatrist
in
an
institution
tend
to
over
institutionalize
they
tend
to
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well
that
is
the
part
of
the
unreliability
of
the
whole
process
the
danger
i
would
much
prefer
that
the
hearing
be
held
in
front
of
a
judge
or
at
least
some
other
substitute
such
as
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
you
are
speaking
with
the
voluntary
admission
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yeah
we
do
not
feel
that
parents
have
been
able
to
institutionalize
their
children
in
state
mental
institutions
for
centuries,
not
until
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
explicit
recognition
of
i
would
think
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
traditional
way
that
we
protect
children
is
through
the
parents
and
we
are
asking
the
court
here
under
these
very
narrow
circumstances
that
is
institutionalization
in
a
mental
hospital
that
the
traditional
way
we
protect
children
is
not
valid
here
and
we
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
leads
to
that
sort
of
conclusion
if
i
may
review
some
of
the
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
it
has
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there
is
not
there,
of
course
the
difference
between
those
two
i
think
is,
that
in
the
case
of
an
adult
of
course
it
is
truly
voluntary,
i
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
part
of
our
argument
is
that
the
traditional
protections
though
for
the
child
are
not
here
under
these
instances
and
let
me
review
for
you.
the
basis
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
are
number
of
reasons
that
it
is
different.
one
the
stigma
of
institutionalization
in
a
mental
institution
far
transcends
any
stigma
that
might
be
attached
to
the
regular
hospital
and
secondly
the
very
essence
of
treatment
in
a
mental
institution
is
confinement.
that
is
the
purpose
of
putting
somebody
in
a
maximum
security
mental
hospital
is
to
confine
them
to
deprive
them
of
their
liberty.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
incidental
to
the
treatment
and
historically
we
have
treated
the
two
very
differently.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
reason
that
you
would
be
in
a
state
mental
institution
rather
than
some
alternative
facility,
less
restrictive
facility
would
be
for
the
confinement
itself
and
there
is
testimony
from
dr.
hodges
(ph)
and
others
that,
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about
in
the
mental
facility
itself
and
i
am
not
talking
about
the
community
facilities
or
that
sort
of
thing.
but
historically
the
law
has
treated
the
two
differently
in
sam
brako
(ph)
in
his
book
for
the
american
bar
association
has
pointed
out
that
historically
our
law
has
required
very
strict
requirements
in
terms
of
placing
people
in
state
mental
institution.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
voluntary
commitment
is
a
relatively
new
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
not
for
adults.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
we
think
the
hearing
examiner
or
whoever
the
state
decides
should
make
the
decision,
right
now
under
the
way
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
are
different
ways
like
we
have
got
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
adequate,
i
mean
our
two
main
plaintiffs
are
perfect
examples
of
why
it
is
not
adequate
too.
both
of
them
were
recommended
by
their
primary
therapist
not
to
go
in
an
institution
and
yet
this
process
provided
them
with
absolutely
no
protections
and
if
i
might
get
to
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
if
he
finally
did
after
five
years
in
a
mental
institution.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well
fundamentally
we
do
not
think
that
a
young
child
six
or
seven
years
old
could
be
expected
isolated
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well
if
they
were
hearing
there
can
be
a
lawyer
appointed,
there
can
be
guardian
ad
litem
appointed.
there
would
be
somebody.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
through
a
process
of
automatically
giving
hearing
as
they
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no
your
honor,
unless
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well
they
found
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
court
found
that
the
process
in
itself
was
inadequate
because
of
the
institutional
biases,
because
of
the
tentativeness
of
judgment.
those
reasons
the
court
found
that
it
was
inadequate.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
not
the
only
alternative
here.
there
are
other
alternatives.
the
question
is
whether
they
are
in
need
of
treatment
and
a
maximum
security
mental
hospital.
no
question
there
are
other
places
that
the
children
can
be
placed,
there
are
other
alternatives.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
if
i
might
address
that
for
a
minute.
our
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
all
of
these
situations
involve
stressful
home
situations,
emotionally
charged
home
situations.
that
was
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
experts,
parents
cannot
under
those
circumstances
be
expected
to
be
totally
objective
about
the
process.
secondly
every
expert
in
this
case
including
all
of
the
superintendents
of
the
hospitals
testified
that
the
pathology
of
the
child
is
inextricably
related
to
the
pathology
of
the
parents.
that
is
the
parents
themselves
are
a
part
of
the
problem
that
is
going
on
here
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
is
that
further
step
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor
we
feel
that
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
of
where
that
stage
is
inadequate
for
instance,
a
psychiatrist
does
not
necessarily
even
see
the
child
before
the
child
is
placed
in
the
institution.
dr.
gates
(ph)
testified
that
sometimes
no
psychiatrist
even
sees
the
child
until
later.
until
the
decision
is
already
made
to
commit
the
child.
they
rely
so
heavily
on
this
elaborate
community
screening
to
provide
them
with
adequate
information,
they
themselves
admit
that
the
procedure
at
the
hospital
itself
is
very,
very
informal
and
i
think
subject
to
error.
what
they
claim
though
to
substitute
for
that
is
this
elaborate
community
screening
process
outside
the
hospital
and
yet
dr.
filly
who
is
head
of
the
thing
testified
that,
that
component
is
lagging
way,
way
behind.
it
does
not
always
--
it
is
not
always
followed,
in
fact
frequently
it
is
not
followed.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
because
that
issue
is
not
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
prior
to
the
break
the
chief
justice
had
asked
me
the
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
different
if
there
were
a
panel
of
12
psychiatrist
and
one
of
those
12
participated
in
the
decision
making
process,
would
that
satisfy
our
need
for
hearing
if
i
understood
the
question
correctly.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
only
10.
i
do
not
think
that
the
two
would
be
material
anyway.
my
response
to
that
would
be
no.
not
as
long
as
the
process
was
set
up
the
same
as
it
is
right
now.
our
basic
position
is,
is
that
the
process
right
now
does
not
protect
the
child's
interest
in
terms
of
sifting
the
facts,
sifting
through
the
facts.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
child
to
cross
examine
what
has
allegedly
been
his
conduct.
there
are
no
state
wide
standards
or
procedures
where
the
child
knows
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
court
has
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
rules
because
all
the
court's
advice,
your
procedure
has
no
protections
in
it
whatsoever
and
look
to
other
state
laws,
that
do
provide
some
protection
to
children
and
do
involve
commitment
of
children
to
mental
institutions
and
said
use
those
in
the
interim.
if
the
legislature
wants
to
come
in
and
set
up
other
provisions,
then
they
are
free
to
do
that
under
the
court's
decision.
but,
the
court's
pointed
to
the
juvenile
court
code
which
does
allow
the
child
to
have
a
hearing
and
yet
takes
care
of
the
very
trauma
issues
that
you
raise.
that
is
it
has
provisions
in
there
to
help
deal
within
the
alleged
trauma
that
might
take
place.
there
is
a
provision
there
for
excusing
the
child
from
the
hearing
at
certain
process,
certain
times.
there
is
provision
for
appointment
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
to
make
sure
the
child's
interests
are
adequately
protected.
the
court
did
not
specify
what
additional
protections
would
be
needed.
it
simply
said,
the
georgia
procedure
as
it
presently
exist
is
not
enough.
there
needs
to
be
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
that
they
were
available
and
that
they
did
provide
some
type
of
hearing.
yes,
your
honor
and
in
fact,
one-third
of
the
children
in
georgia
that
are
committed--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
how
adults
are
normally
institutionalized.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
court
of
ordinary.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
is
a
probate
court,
yes
your
honor
and
children
could
be
committed
through
that,
in
fact
they
are
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
if
they
were
non-institutional
psychiatrist.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
that
it
might
well
comport
with
due
process
as
long
as
there
were
some
procedures,
some
opportunity
for
the
child
and
child
representatives
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
cross-examining
whatever
data
is
brought
before
those
psychiatrists.
right
now,
the
child
is
institutionalized
because
of
data
that
comes
from
the
community.
that
says
the
child
did
such
and
so
his
demeanor
has
been
in
such
and
such
in
school
and
there
is
no
chance
for
the
child
to
confront
that
and
to
say,
no,
that
is
not
the
way
it
was.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
or
a
representative
for
that
child.
i
feel
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
representative
can
investigate
and
cross-examine
the
people
and
see
whether
that
is
--
it
is
done
every
day.
and
we
feel
strongly
in
terms
of
the
age
of
the
children.
that
a
four
or
a
five
or
a
six
year
old,
that
there
has
to
be
protection
there
too,
it
is
dramatically
illustrated
by
the
two
children
that
are
named
plaintiffs.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
habeas
corpus
with
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not.
we
feel
that
preventing
inappropriate
hospitalization
would
not
be
accomplished
by
a
case
by
case
habeas
approach.
the
children
are
not
going
to
know
about
those
remedies.
they
are
not
going
to
have
the
where
do
i
to
use
those
remedies.
a
lot
of
the
balancing
that
i
am
talking
about
right
here,
under
the
mathews
eldridge
test
requires
that
you
look
at
all
elements.
and
i
really
have
not
talked,
about
the
magnitude
of
the
child's
interest.
but,
we
are
talking
about
here
two
children,
that
were
hospitalized
for
five-and-a-half
years
in
a
institution
and
now
their
own
psychiatrist
is
saying
they
do
not
even
need
to
be
there.
their
outpatient
therapist
said
they
did
not
need
to
be
there
in
the
first
place.
that
is
a
rather
enormous
interest
that
we
are
talking
about
right
here.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
is
ironic
to
me,
that
i
was
furnished
a
list
this
morning.
there
were
forty
six
kids
that
the
state
has
consistently
said
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
with
these
children.
there
are
no
alternatives
for
them
and
yet
all,
but
two
of
them
are
out
of
the
institution
now
and
they
have
not
built
any
new
facilities.
there
are
other
alternatives
available
and
i
think
that
this
due
process
hearing
that
we
are
talking
about,
whatever
the
particular
form
might
be
would
center
in
on
that
one
thing
it
would
be
well
worth
the
effort.
that
is
in
the
community,
to
look
at
what
other
alternatives
are
available
and
to
look
at
that
in
the
community
and
to
see
if
there
are
other
alternatives.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
we
are
talking
about
through
age
17.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
cannot
imagine
any
more
trauma
on
a
child
and
what
j.l.
and
j.r.
had
gone
through
for
the
past
five
years
to
be
dumped
and
literally
dumped
into
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yeah
the
testimony
of
dr.
messinger
is
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
classic,
more
clear
cut
example
of
parents
dumping
a
child
then
the
case
of
j.l.
but,
getting
to
your
question,
there
is
an
amicus
curie
brief
before
the
court
right
now.
in
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
mandated
just
such
a
procedure
there
and
their
experience
has
been
that
in
fact
these
hearings
have
been
therapeutic
in
terms
of
the
patch
in
our
relationship.
it
is
no
mystery
to
children
that
there
are
conflicts
within
the
family.
children's
judgment
may
not
be
totally
intact,
but
children's
–
i
know
from
having
several
of
them,
that
children's
perceptions
are
very
good.
even
a
five-year-old
has
very
good
perception.
they
can
pick
up
conflict,
they
know
there
is
conflict
with
their
parents,
they
know
there
is
conflict
there.
the
hearing
can
actually
be
traumatic,
it
can
be
therapeutic
if
done,
say
the
way
we
do
it
in
a
juvenile
court
right
now.
now,
i
cannot
say
how
juvenile
courts
work
around
the
country,
but
i
know
in
georgia,
our
juvenile
court
works
and
it
worked
well.
i
think
we
have
kept
the
best
of
both
and
i
have
had
a
lot
of
practice
in
juvenile
court.
we
have
managed
to
keep
it
informal
enough
to
where
nobody
is
traumatized
by
the
process
and
yet
it
is
formal
enough
to
adequately
protect
the
rights
of
the
people.
your
honor,
i
think
it
can
be
done.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
will
manage,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
will
now.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
state
has
categorized
the
issue
correctly.
at
page
135
of
the
court's
opinion,
it
made
very
clear
that
what
it
was
finding
here,
was
that
by
the
state's
own
admission
that
there
were
46
children
who
did
not
need
to
be
in
hospital
and
secondly
that
they
were
being
harmed
by
a
continued
stay
in
that
hospital.
and
what
the
court
did,
it
took
the
jackson
versus
indiana
test
and
said
that
if
you
are
going
to
hold
children
there
is
going
to
be
some
relationship
between
the
holding
and
what
you
are
trying
to
do
for
them.
i
think
that
the
court's
holding
is
very,
very
limited,
much
more
limited,
then
what
the
state
would
categorize
it
as.
it
is
a
very
limited
holding.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
was
a
ruling
that
applied
to
46
names
specific
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
they
were
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
relieve
the
unconstitutional
condition
that
existed.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
they
probably
could.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
the
way
the
state
has.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
was
convinced
in
its
own
mind
that
the
state
of
georgia
did
not
have
to
spend
anything.
that
it
would
actually
be
cheaper
to
have
these
children
and
less
expensive
resources.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they
said
if
that
was
what
was
necessary,
to
spend
the
money.
the
court
had
told
them
several
times,
we
do
not
think
that
you
have
to
spend
any
money.
we
think
its
cheaper
to
have
these
children
in
less
restrictive,
less
confining
environments.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
is
a
good
bit
of
flexibility
in
what
the
court
did
because
it
really
did
not
say
this
is
what
is
required,
x,
y
and
z,
because
the
epa
brief
agreed
that
the
georgia
procedures
were
invalid,
what
they
said
was,
with
an
intact
family
for
a
short
period
of
time
for
accredited
institution
for
a
pre-adolescent
child,
the
balancing
maybe
different
there.
and
clearly,
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
