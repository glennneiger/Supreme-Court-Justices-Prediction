justice
john
paul
stevens
and
mr.
comartie
i
might
just
ask
one
question
about
what
is
going
to
happen
next
after
the
case
leaves
this
court.
one
of
the
briefs
filed
by
one
of
the
associations
suggest
tthat
there
should
be
an
exemption
for
intact
families
pre-adolescent
children
and
for
commitments
for
short
periods
of
time,
at
least
when
all
those
conditions
are
met.
could
that
be
done
consistently
with
the
manner
which
the
case
was
disposed
or
belowered
does
that
require.
how
much
flexibility
is
there
and
what
goes
on
next
i
guess
what
i
am
really
asking.
