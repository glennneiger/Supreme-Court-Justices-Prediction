justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
read
the
decree
then
as
the
italicized
portion
of
page
54-a,
as
requiring
the
state
to
spend
money
if
necessary
to
build
these
facilities
as
something
that
must
be
complied
but
even
though
the
state
would
prefer
to
simply
turn
the
children
loose
from
any
confinement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
does
that
bear
on
the
circumstances
of
confinement
to
say
that
the
word
optimal
came
out
of
a
study
commission
report
and
therefore
the
constitution
requires
“optimal”
confinement
or
none
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
time
has
gone
by
since
--
between
the
entry
of
the
district
court's
decree
in
the
present
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
76.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
isn't
it
conceivable
in
two
and
a
half
years
there
could
be
a
movement
of
the
institutional
population
such
that
vacancies
would
open
up
in
existing
facilities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
have
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
44
of
the
46
are
now
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
on
your
first
--
on
your
first
point
that
medical
--
that
mental
care
is
coercive
by
its
nature.
it
surely
no
more
coercive
than
to
put
a
child
in
the
hospital
and
have
his
leg
amputated
because
he
has
a
kind
of
cancer
that
might
spread,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
doesn't
distinguish
physical
care
from
mental
care
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
the
parents
have
to
have
a
hearing
and
the
child
must
have
a
lawyer
before
a
child
--
the
parent
of
an
eight-year
old
child
can
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
its
leg
amputated
because
of
a
possibility
of
spreading
cancer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
constitution
requires
that,
of
georgia,
if
georgia
chooses
to
come
down
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
in
georgia
before
a
parent
can
have
a
child
put
in
the
hospital
for
an
operation
to
amputate
a
leg,
the
sort
of
hearings
that
you're
contending
for
here
in
mental
cases
be
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
protection
from
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
but
then
your
first
argument
that
the
--
about
the
coercive
nature
of
mental
care
as
opposed
to
physical
care
is
--
breaks
down
and
you
have
to
rely
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
coercive
argument
had
--
doesn't
wash
in
the
cancer
occasion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
--
what
are
--
what
is
the
issue
of
fact
that
would
be
determined
in
the
hearing
that
the
district
court
is
ordered
be
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ultimate
issue
that
the
finder
of
fact
would
have
to
pass
on
is
whether
or
not
the
child
is
or
is
not
mentally
ill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
what
type
of
person
makes
this
decision?
is
it
a
psychiatrist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
could
be
a
layperson.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
recommend?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
an
answer
to
justice
white's
question
that
the
present
georgia
law
does
not
allow
an
institution
to
receive
a
patient
if
--
it
finds,
if
the
psychiatrist
finds
that
he
could
be
treated
at
home,
is
that
right?
