justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you
mr.
lackey.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
constitution
and
the
united
states
would
prohibit
the
intervention
by
the
state
and
that
sort
of
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
constitution
would
absolutely
prohibit
the
intervention
by
the
state
in
that
sort
of
a
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
or
are
you
suggesting
that
it's
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
leave
that
decision
to
their
parents.
those
are
two
quite
different
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
propositions,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
two
quite
different
propositions.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
now
which
are
you
suggesting?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
go
merely
that
far
in
arguing
this
case,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
it's
rather
important
because
those
are
two
quite
different
propositions.
first,
their
claim
based
upon
the
cases
like
meyer
against
nebraska
and
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
and
to
an
extent
yoder
perhaps,
that
it
would
be
--
that
a
state
would
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
intervening
in
a
parent-child
relationship.
that's
one
proposition
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
is
that
a
state
may
constitutionally
leave
such
a
decision
up
to
the
parent
but
need
not
constitutionally
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
all
you
need
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
child
is
locked
up
and
not
the
parent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
not
surely
or
are
you
suggesting
in
that
sort
of
our
brother
brennan's
question
that
there
is
not
a
deprivation
of
liberty?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
have
a
problem
there
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
state
that
was
depriving
the
child
his
liberty
or
just
--
or
a
private
person,
the
parent.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
don't
always
have
to
have
a
hearing
if
you
just
find
the
fourteenth
amendment
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
child
get
--
what
triggers
the
examination
originally,
the
original
examination
by
the
physician?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
the
parent
that
triggers
it.
justice
potter
stewart
parent
or
somebody
in
loco
parentis.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
--
is
it
the
parent's
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
would
initiate
those
juvenile
court
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
a
neighbor
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
have
a
child,
five
or
six
years
old,
is
that,
i
mean,
practical
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
your
description
of
this
procedure
with
respect
to
the
voluntary
commitment
of
a
child,
you'd
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
could
just
trace
very
briefly
the
comparable
procedure
for
the
voluntary
commitment
of
an
adult.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
triggers
that
if
--
let's
assume,
he
is
--
does
the
georgia
law
presumed
that
even
though
he
is
putatively
mentally
ill,
he
is
capable
of
making
the
decision
to
voluntarily
commit
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
at
the
same
time
you
admit
him
to
a
mental
hospital.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
only
if
he
goes
voluntarily
to
a
physician
does
the
process
of
a
voluntary
commitment
begin
with
respect
to
an
adult?
justice
potter
stewart
as
--
and
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
after
he
is
inside
the
hospital,
does
he
have
available
to
him
those
two
resources
that
you
mentioned,
the
advocate
and
the
booklet?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
there
all
the
procedures
except
for
the
juvenile
court.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
same
with
respect
to
the
child
if
his
parent,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
the
whole
georgia
procedures
i
understand
it
for
it
simply
substitutes
the
parent
for
the
individual
in
a
voluntary
commitment
if
the
voluntary
committee
is
a
non-adult.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
the
definition
of
a
child
for
this
purpose
in
georgia?
justice
potter
stewart
18
or
under?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he's
18,
he's
still
a
child.
justice
potter
stewart
his
18th
birthday,
he
isn't
--
he's
no
longer
a
child.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lackey,
does
this
involve
only
mentally
ill,
only
the
mentally
ill
or
does
it
also
involve
the
mentally
retarded?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
--
the
state
has
appealed
the
decision
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
all
those
evidence
that
the
state
thinks
it's
a
wrong
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
court
held
that
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
the
state
of
georgia
provide
that
the
mentally
ill
child
must
be
treated
in
the
setting
most
considered
most
appropriate
to
his
condition
either
that
the
state
of
georgia
must
do
that
or
else
not
treat
them
at
all.
and
your
adversary
claims
it
--
at
least
no
room
for
the
second
or
third
or
fourth
most
appropriate.
it's
either
the
most
appropriate
or
nothing.
and
that
the
court
held
that
the
constitution
requires
that.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
where
is
the
1973
study
commission
get
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
somebody's
--
yes,
your
honor.
around
20%
of
the
class
would
be
in
--
that
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
j.r.
was
a
ward
of
the
state
since
near
birth.
justice
potter
stewart
for
what
reason?
does
the
parent
or
parents
had
--
whether
dead
had
been
declared
to
be
unfit
as
parents?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
may
i
ask
you
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
is
there
a
provision
in
georgia
law
for
the
involuntary
commitment
which
i
--
let's
assume
as
parent
doesn't
take
the
initiative
and
indeed
if
it's
suggested
to
the
parent
that
he
do
take
the
initiative.
he
said,
“absolutely
not.
i
will
not.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
my
child
is
either
perfectly
well
or
if
not
well,
he's
going
to
stay
home.
i'm
not
going
--
i'm
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
about
it
with
his
being
admitted
to
a
hospital.”
is
there
a
provision
for
the
involuntary
commitment
of
a
child
in
circumstances
such
as
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
then
through
an
involuntary
commitment
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said,
anyone
could
initiate
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
but
this
is
a
little
different.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
some
--
there
are
some
hearings
of
--
i
suppose
the
involuntary
commitment
of
a
child
is
no
different
from
the
involuntary
commitment
of
an
adult
basically,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
hearings
when
there's
a
voluntary
commitment
of
an
adult.
there
are
no
hearings
when
there's
--
excuse
me,
there
are
hearings
when
there's
an
involuntary
commitment
of
an
adult
and
there
are
no
hearings
when
there's
a
voluntary
commitment.
there
are
simply
these
same
checks
on
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
there's
--
if
you
want
to
analogize
there
is
a
jury
trial,
if
you
ever
write
to
a
jury
trial
if
you've
plead
not
guilty,
you
don't
if
you've
waived
it
if
you've
plead
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
analogizing
it
as
you
do
to
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know
you're
not.
i
know
you're
not.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you're
not.
but
you
do
analogize
these
three,
your
reliance
on
cases
such
as
in
re
gault
and
others
to
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
also
true
in
the
volun
--
when
you
--
when
an
adult
voluntarily
admits
himself
to
a
hospital,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
its
--
to
the
same
option
that
put
him
in
can
take
him
out.
i.e,
though
--
the
desire
of
his
parent,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
georgia
has
said
that
it's
voluntary
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
georgia
cons
--
can
agreeably
to
the
constitution
adhere
to
the
centuries
old
common
law
rule
that
a
parent
speaks
for
his
child.
and
the
common
law
presumption
that
there's
a
community
of
interest
between
child
and
parent.
that's
the
basic
question
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
--
there
are
cases
that
hold
that
a
--
that
the
state
is
not
prohibited
by
the
constitution
from
interfering
in
such
a
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
quite
a
different
holding.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
once
an
adult
voluntarily
gets
himself
admitted
to
a
mental
hospital,
he
is
locked
up
there,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
get
out.
the
child
can
get
out
of
--
on
the
wish
of
his
parents.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
say
he'd
been
adult
and
didn't
want
in
and
they
would
not
voluntarily
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
gotten
themselves
admitted
to
a
hospital,
would
they?
it's
true.
that's
true.
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
thought
that
a
good
deal
of
your
case
depended
upon
evidence,
the
record
of
which
contains
a
good
deal,
that
because
of
the
relative
unreliability
of
psychiatry
as
contrasted
with
the
more
conventional
forms
of
medical
practice,
a
hearing
was
appropriate
because
of
the
consequent
risk
of
incorrect
decisions.
and
that
therefore,
you
would
distinguish
the
tuberculosis
situation
on
that
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
that
would
require
i
would
suppose
logically
for
you
to
contend
that
the
constitution
requires
notice
and
hearing
with
respect
to
a
leg
amputation
or
admission
to
a
tuberculosis
sanitarium.
justice
potter
stewart
concede?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
ultimate
issue
in
fact.
