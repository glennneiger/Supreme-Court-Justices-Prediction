mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
what
i
view
as
the
three
essential
issues
in
this
case.
but
before
getting
into
those
three
essential
issues,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
two
collateral
issues
that
arise
out
of
the
last
oral
argument
just
very,
very
briefly.
one
is
a
legislative
change
during
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly.
the
state
legislature
passed
a
new
mental
health
code.
the
portion
dealing
with
juveniles
was
accompanied
by
what
we
call
a
sunrise
provision.
that
is
if
this
case
is
affirmed
by
this
court
then
those
provisions
would
take
effect.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
about
what
would
happen
if
we
strike
down
the
statute.
would
there
be
practical
alternatives
available
for
parents,
for
hospitals,
in
terms
of
placing
children
in
mental
hospitals.
this
new
statute
seems
to
comply
with
all
of
the
mandates
of
the
district
court
and
thus,
it
seems
to
us
would
be
constitutional.
so,
i
bring
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
from
my
last
conversation
with
the
state
on
that
that
there
are
two
of
those
children
still
within
the
terms
of
that
order,
that
is
they
are
still
confined
within
mental
hospitals.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
just
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
new
statute,
it
mandates
that
children
be
provided
with
care
in
the
least
restrictive
environment.
that
is,
if
there
were
a
choice
between
a
foster
home
and
a
mental
institution,
they
would
be
placed
in
the
foster
institution
but
--
the
foster
home
that
is.
i
don't
think
that
the
new
statute
specifically
addresses
the
question
that
you're
asking
now.
secondly,
there
was
a
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
was
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general.
we
felt
like
the
statute
was
going
be
passed
by
the
legislature
and
in
support
of
the
passage
of
it.
but
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general,
the
committee
added
in
the
sunrise
provision.
so,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
state
legislature,
that
the
court
was
all
wrong.
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
they
certainly
did
not
put
into
effect
a
new
statute.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
clearly
in
my
judgment,
this
--
the
statute
that
was
passed
would
have
mooted
out
those
aspects
of
the
case.
the
second
preliminary
question
i'd
like
to
deal
with
is
a
question
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
stevens
right
at
the
end
of
the
argument.
i
believe
that
you
asked
me
the
questions
to
whether
the
georgia
procedures
are
invalid
under
the
district
court's
holding
even
as
to
those
children
who
were
within
the
american
psychiatric
associations'
four
criteria.
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
i
exchanged
that
you
ended
up
with
the
answer
that
i
meant
to
give
to
you.
what
i
meant
to
say
to
you
there
was,
is
that
under
the
apa
standards,
all
of
the
children
under
the
present
georgia
law
are
in
indefinitely.
and
therefore,
the
apa's
position
is
that
all
of
those
children
would
be
entitled
to
hearings.
and
that
secondly,
the
district
court
did
not
deal
expressly
with
the
other
three
criteria
that
the
apa
set
forth
although
i
see
nothing
inconsistent
in
what
the
district
court's
order
was
from
those
other
criteria.
now,
i
personally
have
some
problems
with
the
specific
four
criteria
that
the
apa
set
forth.
but
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is,
no,
the
district
court
decision
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
apa
position.
the
three
issues
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with,
is
first
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
is,
commitment
of
a
child
to
a
mental
institution.
does
the
doctrine
of
parental
autonomy
or
family
unity
or
however
that
doctrine
may
be
characterized,
does
this
preclude
additional
protections
for
the
child?
secondly,
does
the
process
at
the
institution
itself
adequately
protect
the
child
or
is
there
a
need
for
more
procedures.
and
thirdly,
will
the
procedures
ordered
by
the
district
court
act
as
a
reduced
to
have
risk.
will
they
have
a
tendency
to
prevent
inappropriate
institutionalization?
i
have
no
intention
of
spending
time
on
the
substantive
due
process
issue
although
i
would
certainly
answer
any
questions.
i
feel
like
that
i
address
that
issue
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
is
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
two
--
well,
the
46
children
should
be
taken
out
of
the
state
mental
institutions
when
they
were
faced
with
evidence
from
the
state
itself
that
these
children
did
not
to
be
in
a
state
mental
institution
and
that
they
were
being
positively
harmed
by
being
in
that
institution.
and
in
the
face
of
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
had
little
other
choice
but
to
order
that
they'd
be
taken
out
of
the
institution.
it
is
not
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
term
optimal
which
used
by
the
court
i
believe
that
they
picked
up
that
phrase
from
the
1973
study
commission
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
it
is
a
part
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
said
a
great
deal
about
the
conditions
within
the
mental
institutions
within
a
state
and
the
district
court
was
--
felt
that
that
study
was
consistent
with
its
own
observations
and
with
a
testimony
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
district
court
ordered
in
the
case.
i
think
if
you
will
look
further
in
the
opinion
where
the
court
actually
ordered
relief
that
you
find
that
what
the
court
said
was,
was
to
provide
necessary
physical
resources
in
personnel
for
whatever
non-hospital
facilities
are
deemed
by
them
to
be
most
appropriate.
i
think
that
the
district
court
was
a
great
deal
more
flexible
than
that
in
terms
of
what
it
ordered.
i
think
that
what
it
ordered
was
is
that
if
these
children
were
going
to
be
harmed
by
being
in
the
institution
and
the
state
admitted
this
then
they
had
to
get
them
out
of
there.
i'm
merely
was
referring
to
the
optimal
as
what
i
think
was
unfortunate
language
that
does
not
suggest
the
true
intent
of
the
court
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
i
think
that's
implicit,
that
at
least
that
the
child
not
be
harmed
and
that
was
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
would
support
the
treatment
of
the
children
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
case
of
jackson
versus
indiana
and
shelton
versus
tucker
and
others
speak
to
the
issue
of
not
harming
people,
that
is
whatever
restrictions
you
place
on
the
children
have
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
certainly
not
the
evidence
in
this
case.
the
evidence
of
the
states
own
doctors
is
that
the
children
were
being
positively
harmed
by
being
in
the
institution.
that
is
certainly
not
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
were
many
children
in
georgia
who
were
in
institutions
that
were
not
being
harmed.
there
were
many
other
children,
other
than
the
46
who
were
actually
being
treated.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
oh,
the
state's
position
was
that
there
were
no
such
institutions.
it's
remarkable
to
me
that
of
the
46,
they
have
been
no
new
facilities
built
and
yet
44
of
those
children
have
been
placed
in
these
non-existent
facilities.
it
suggests
to
me
that
the
facilities
are
in
fact
present
but
the
state
has
not
gone
to
the
trouble
to
locate
them.
and
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
also.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
decree
has
entered
around
february
of
19
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
76,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
somewhat
possible
although
44
of
the
46
were
out
at
the
time
this
case
was
last
argued
almost
a
year
ago.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
information
that
i
have
is
not
to
that
effect.
many
of
the
children
were
placed
in
the
foster
homes
and
other
facilities.
it
was
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
state
had
made
little
or
no
effort
to
find
alternative
facilities.
and
i
see
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
rebut
that
finding
by
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no,
that
is
information
that
was
furnished
to
me
by
counsel
for
the
state
during
the
last
oral
argument
of
this
case.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that,
no,
your
honor.
dealing
first
with
the
issue
of
parental
autonomy,
i
would
point
out
first
that
at
least
a
portion
of
the
class.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
parental
autonomy
doctrine
has
no
application
too.
that
is
those
of
the
children
that
were
wards
of
the
state
and
who
were
actually
institutionalized
by
the
state
themselves.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
one
of
those
two,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
your
honor.
in
fact
one
third
of
the
children
that
are
committed
in
the
states
are
committed
through
judicial
proceedings
of
some
kind.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
that
mr.
lackey
addressed
that
issue.
i
think
anyone
can
initiate
the
involuntary
commitment.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
believe
the
same
as
through
under
the
involuntary
commitment
that
anyone
can
initiate
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
a
neighbor
may
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
friend
or
social
worker,
whoever,
yes.
in
fact,
back
in
my
years
as
county
attorney
when
i
was
in
private
practice,
all
of
the
juveniles
children,
17
and
under
were
involuntary
committed
rather
than
voluntarily
committed
because
the
probate
judge
didn't
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
voluntary
commitment.
and
it
is
that
experience
that
convinces
me
that
those
hearings
that
we
are
suggesting
should
be
held
can
be
held
in
a
way
that
it's
not
under
some
traumatic
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
are
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that's
true,
i
mean,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
and
in
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
because
we
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
of
course
we're
not
suggesting
that
a
jury
trial
should
be
made
available
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
the
court
has
precluded
that
in
the
juvenile
delinquency
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
we've
relied
very
heavily
in
this
case
on
the
magnitude
of
the
child's
interest.
the
magnitude
is
simply
enormous.
we
are
talking
about
children
being
locked
in
the
sterile
walls
of
institutions
where
the
process
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
but
an
--
but
adult
can
turn
around
and
say,
“i
want
out.”
and
they
must
be
let
out
or
involuntarily
committed.
and
a
child
does
not
have
that
option.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
is
a
disagreement
that
i
think
that
we
had
in
the
last
oral
argument
about
whether
the
placement
of
a
child
in
an
institution
is
truly
voluntarily
because
if
you
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
i
find
absolutely
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
a
parent
has
ever
been
able
to
institutionalized
a
child
in
a
state
mental
institution.
i
find
no
authority
to
support
that
proposition.
i
would
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
child
would
be
cared
to
a
doctor,
to
a
hospital
and
treated
there
and
we
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
confined.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it's
not
my
understanding
that
tuberculosis
treatment
is
confined
in
the
same
sense
that
you
confine
in
a
mental
institution.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
what's
the
difference
in
the
sense
if
he
is
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
i
may
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
for
centuries,
the
courts
have
treated
physical
care
and
physical
treatment
different
from
mental
commitment
because
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
court's
have.
the
georgia
court's
have,
morton
versus
sims
and
other
cases
have
said,
“mental
commitment
is
by
its
very
nature
coercive.
it
--
it's
coercive
by
its
nature.
plus,
it
is
not
--
they
are
not
commonly
accepted
medical
norms.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that.
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
think
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
it
distinguishes
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
i
am
sure
that
there
are
cases
at
the
far
extreme
which
in
the
extreme
might
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
are
cases
that
have
held
that
that
is
subject
to
judicial
scrutiny
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
requires
which
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no,
no
your
honor.
we
feel
like
that
there
is
enough
protection
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given
to
me
so
that
that
is
not
required,
i
mean
there
are
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
protection
from
erroneous
decision
making.
in
the
case
of
the
cancer,
there
are
medical
tests
that
can
be
run
that
can
tell
you
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
is
cancer
there
or
not.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
oh,
no.
it's
a
combination
of
those
two
arguments
plus
our
stigma
argument.
and
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
are
circumstances
where
it
does
not
wash.
it
washes,
i
would
contend
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
but
we
look
on
as
a
combination
of
all
three
of
those
elements
in
terms
of
deciding
whether
the
two
are
in
fact
distinct
or
not.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
he
can
get
out
by
requesting.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
in
the
case
of
j.l.
and
j.r.,
they
wanted
out
right
after
they
got
in.
they
didn't
want
to
go
in.
if
they
had
been
an
adult,
they
could
have
requested
of
the
superintendent
that
they'd
be
let
out
and
the
superintendent
would
have
either
had
to
let
them
out.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
forbid
that
confinement,
the
connotation
on
liberty?
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
no
your
honor.
we
look
on
that
in
terms
of
its
magnitude
of
any
deprivation
as
just
far
different
from
the
magnitude
of
the
deprivation
we're
talking
about
right
here.
the
courts
have
always
looked
suspiciously
on
physical
confinement
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
right
here.
that's
the
essence
of
mental
health's
treatment.
it
is
what
distinguishes
commitment
in
the
mental
hospital
from,
say,
a
group
home.
it
is
the
physical
confinement
feature
that
distinguishes
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
can't
imagine
this
court
holding
that
that
was
--
there
was
a
need
for
a
due
process
protections
there.
for
one
thing,
i
would
not
find
the
presence
of
state
action
there.
and
secondly,
it's
readily
distinguishable
from
our
case.
here,
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
parents
have
gone
to
the
state
and
said,
“we
cannot
handle
the
child.
state,
you
take
the
child
and
lock
the
child
up
in
effect.”
that
would
not
happen
in
the
military
school
situation.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
if
it
was
a
situation
involving
a
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
would
then
argue
there
that
any
person
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
they
were
placed
there
because
we
are
talking
about
long
term
deprivation.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
we
have
always
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
we
have
always
conceded
the
emergencies
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
emergencies,
that
the
hearing
can
occur
afterwards,
that
the
state's
hand
is
not
tied
in
the
tuberculosis
situation,
certainly
there
could
be
a
hearing
afterwards.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
a
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
that
the
more
basic
argument
that
we
have
is
that
when
there
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty
as
extreme
as
right
here,
that
in
traditionally,
our
courts
have
provided
at
least
notice
in
a
hearing
to
the
person
involved
and
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
--
i
think
i
would
concede
the
tuberculosis
sanitarium
but
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
it
would
probably
require
a
hearing
there.
we
don't
feel
like
in
the
leg
amputation,
that
the
elements
involved
that
we
have
in
this
case,
distinguishing
it
in
terms
of
the
family
autonomy
and
breaking
into
the
family
autonomy,
it
would
be
present
in
the
leg
amputation
situation
whereas
they
are
here.
the
potential
for
conflict
of
interest,
the
request
by
the
family
itself
that
the
child
be
taken
out
of
the
home.
we
feel
like
that
those
are
different
for
those
reasons.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
your
honor,
there
were
several
points
that
we
made.
that
was
one
of
them.
the
other
one
was
that
this
situation
was
different
because
the
parent
had
gone
to
the
state
and
asked
the
state
to
intervene.
and
in
the
wyman
versus
james
sense,
had
ceded
some
of
its
authority
that
it
traditionally
would
have
to
the
state.
but
also
our
argument
was
because
of
the
manifest
potential
for
conflicts
of
interest.
just
by
nature,
this
is
a
stressful
situation,
emotional
situation.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
might
will
not
your
honor.
it
might
will
not.
i
was
more
troubled
by
the
tuberculosis
situation
because
of
the
stigma
and
that
sort
of
thing
involved
in
that
situation
than
i
was
with
the
amputation
situation.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
very
rare.
the
evidence
shows
that
most
of
the
children
are
mildly
diagnosed
here.
they
are
not
the
severely
mentally
ill.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
there
can
be.
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
it's
not
as
frequent
with
children
in
adolescence
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
your
honor
in
jackson
versus
indiana,
you
had
a
person
who
by
all
evidence
was
incapable
of
participating
in
that
proceeding.
and
yet
the
court
felt
it
was
important
to
provide
procedural
protections
to
that
person.
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
speaks
to
that
also.
canon
7
says
that
an
attorney's
responsibility
is
to
do
everything
that
he
or
she
can
to
adequately
get
input
from
the
client,
into
the
client's
wishes.
but
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
client
is
not
able
to
participate.
and
in
that
case,
the
attorney
still
has
the
obligation
to
fully
represent
that
person.
getting
on
toward
the
end
of
my
argument,
we
feel
that
the
cases
of
j.l.
and
j.r.
very
dramatically
illustrate
how
some
sort
of
hearing
process,
informal
though
it
may
be
could
have
prevented
both
of
them
from
spending
over
five
years
of
their
lives
in
a
mental
institution.
in
the
case
of
j.l.,
his
primary
outpatient
therapist
had
recommended
only
a
month
or
so
before
that
he
not
be
institutionalized.
and
yet
janet
scott's
recommendation
was
not
even
considered
when
j.l.
was
placed
into
that
mental
institution.
of
course
also
the
evident
shows
that
j.l.
was
placed
in
the
institution,
the
decision
was
made
three
days
before
he
ever
showed
up
at
the
institution.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
decision.
i
mean
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
typical
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
made
a
many
a
time
to
this
county
attorney
when
i
sat
in
and
was
one
of
the
three
members
of
an
interdisciplinary
team
that
sat
and
listened
to
evidence
such
as
that.
i
mean
it's
the
same
role
that
any
judge
performs
in
any
trial
where
you
have
to
weigh
the
different
evidences
presented
to
you
and
make
a
decision
based
on
that.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
mental
illness
is
grounded
basically
in
behavior
and
there
are
lost
of
issues
of
fact
as
to
what
the
person
has
done
that
allegedly
gives
rise
to
the
conclusion
of
mental
illness.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
with
expert
testimony,
yes.
and
secondly,
there
is
the
important.
and
this
may
well
be
the
most
important
issue
in
these
cases.
and
that
is,
should
the
child
be
here
or
should
the
child
be
somewhere
else.
and
right
now,
when
you
have
a
physician
or
someone
else
at
an
institution
making
that
decision,
they
have
really
only
two
choices.
they
can
either
say,
“child,
go
home.
we
can't
treat
you
at
all.”
or
we're
going
to
put
you
in
this
institution.”
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
conceded
in
the
last
oral
argument
that
the
question
of
who
was
not
so
important
as
the
question
of
how.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it
could
be,
i
mean
i
would
not
recommend
that
but
i
think
it
could
be.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
would
--
i
think
that
the
best
and
what
is
done
in
the
new
act
is
that
the
juvenile
court
judge
would
make
the
decision.
but
now
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that's
a
matter
for
the
legislature,
it
seems
to
me.
and
it
is
not
an
issue
that
we
have
addressed
nor
that
we
have
taken
a
position
on.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that
frequently
is
not
done.
and
the
record
is
very
clear
on
that.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
implicit
in
that
standard,
yes.
that
the
treatment
is
appropriate
in
an
institution
as
opposed
to
being
in
the
home
or
in
the
foster
home.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
they
may
not
but
it's
my
position
that
they
should.
but
they
frequently
don't
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
that
they
frequently
don't.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
well,
i
mean
that's
my
construction
of
the
law
that
it
does
not
allow
that.
now,
obviously,
that
is
not
shared
by
the
psychiatrist.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
could
the
parents
not
placed
them
in
the
foster
home?
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes,
yes,
they
could.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
that's
my
construction,
that
if
a
child
could
be
treated
in
the
home
and
could
--
would
not
be
appropriately
treated
in
the
institution
then
they
cannot
accept
that
child.
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
oh,
okay.
if
that's
the
question,
then
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
law
requires
that
he'd
be
in
the
home
rather
than
in
the
institution.
i'm
sorry.
that
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
the
--
under
the
present
law,
yes
they
could.
if
they
can
be
approved
--
mr.
john
l.
cromartie,
jr.
it's
my
construction
of
the
new
law
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
there.
thank
you.
