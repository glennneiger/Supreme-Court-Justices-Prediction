chief

warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1690,
parham
against
j.l.
and
j.r.
minors.
mr.
lackey
i
think
you
may
proceed,
but
before
you
proceed
in
case
you
were
not
in
hearing
when
i
announced
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
unavoidably
detained
for
parts
of
these
cases,
but
will
participate
in
consideration
and
decision
on
the
record
of
course,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
earlier
you
had
said
something
to
the
effect
that
the
request,
the
demand
was
for
treatments
suitable
to
their
needs
or
something
that
effect,
now
you
mean
that
to
be
the
same
as
the
best
treatment
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
read
the
district
court's
decree
as
to
the
46
individuals
with
whom
it
entered
specific
instructions
as
to
placement
to
foreclose
this
state
from
simply
releasing
them
entirely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
maybe
getting
this
case
confused
with
preceding
case,
is
there
any
claim
for
damages
on
the
behalf
of
the
children
against
the
parents.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
are
not
asking
for
damages
against
their
parents
for
the
decisions
and
actions
of
the
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
done
in
practice
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
they
use
obstetricians
for
this
propose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
dichotomy
between
the
mental
and
other
disease.
if
a
parent
puts
a
nine
year
old
child
in
the
hospital
to
have
his
appendix
or
tonsils
taken
out.
do
you
suggest
that,
that
child
could
be
released
from
the
hospital
by
anyone
except
the
consent
of
the
parents
on
the
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
the
hospital
let
the
child
out
on
the
child's
request,
while
still
under
care
in
the
recuperative
stages
from
the
surgery,
the
hospital
would
surely
be
exposed
to
malpractice
suit,
will
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
hospital
does
not
release
any
minor
without
the
signature
of
the
parent
when
the
child
has
been
in
the
hospital
for
treatment
is
it
not
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
due
process
protection
does
the
child
have
in
your
view,
if
the
parents
are
affluent
and
simply
take
the
child
to
their
own
private
psychiatrist
or
child
specialist
and
that
doctor
recommends
commitment
and
the
commitment
takes
place
in
a
private
hospital.
any
hearing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
apart
from
that
what
would
you
think
about
the
claim
of
the
child,
that
he
was
wrongfully
committed
for
wrongful,
improper
reasons
in
a
malpractice
suit
against
the
physician.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
he
did
not
have
one
against
his
parents.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right,
well
even
when
the
parents
bring
the
child
to
the
hospitals
as
soon
as
the
state
employed
physician,
psychiatrists
enters
the
and
participates
in
the
commitment
would
you
say
that
is
or
is
not
state
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
is
a
state
action
of
that
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
same
way
that
a
state
action
and
if
the
state
was
proceeding
as
a
guardian
ad
litem
for
the
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
may
come
with
the
family
physician,
but
then
that
is
subject
to
screening
by
the
state
authority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
what
processes
do
you
mean,
habeas
corpus
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
a
seven-year-old
child
set
those
proceedings
in
motion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
the
reversal,
mr
justice
marshall's
hypothetical
statement
suppose
the
family
physician
and
two
private
practitioners
of
psychiatry
bring
the
child
to
the
stage
and
say
we
think
the
child
should
be
committed
and
the
state
psychiatrist
makes
the
usual
examination
and
says
no
i
think
this
child
just
needs
outpatient
treatment
and
i
will
not
commit
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
would
it
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
could
force
this
state
to
take
the
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cromartie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
specifically
would
you
explain
at
least
for
my
benefit
why
the
presentation
of
the
child
by
the
parents
to
the
state
psychiatrist
and
the
processes
that
then
occur
is
not
sufficient
due
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
all
the
process
which
is
due,
in
the
circumstances
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
inherently
and
universally
a
conflict
of
interest
between
parent
and
child
in
this
setting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
continue
in
your
own
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
either
of
the
of
the
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
judges
about
their
observation
was
there
any
adversary
process
pretending
the
judge's
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
into
confinement
in
a
mental
hospital
incidental
to
and
the
very
function
of
the
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
whole
argument
from
the
outset
makes
parents
as
such
a
suspect
class
by
saying
your
statement
that
there
is
an
inherent
conflict
between
the
interests
of
the
child
and
the
interest
of
the
parent
and
that,
that
must
be
flushed
out
in
some
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
you
really
said
here
is
that
the
parents
are
suspect,
the
institutional
psychiatrists
are
suspect.
would
it
satisfy
your
notions
of
due
process
if
the
court
had
designated
in
each
community
a
panel
of
10
psychiatrist
or
as
many
as
were
available
and
that
the
institutional
psychiatrist
plus
one
of
the
outside
psychiatrist
picked
at
random
would
make
the
decision.
would
that
take
care
of
due
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
you
did
not
respond
to
that
after
you
had
a
chance
to
think
about
it
during
lunch
hour.
mr.
cromartie
you
may
resume.
i
think
we
have
a
question
pending
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
assuming
of
course
two
things
there.
the
child
is
concerned
with
what
you
call
the
rules
of
the
game
and
second
that,
rules
the
sense
an
--
that
implies
an
adversary
type
proceeding.
maybe
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
a
child
in
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
postulating
here
is
some
sort
of
a
at
least
quasi
adversary
proceeding
and
--
which
is
hear
your
argument
would
be
a
four
sided
sort
of
procedure.
the
parents,
the
child,
the
experts,
the
doctors,
the
medical
experts,
clinical
psychologists
and
the
guardian
ad
litem
and
you
suggested
putting
a
a
child
through
that
four
sided
kind
of
adversary
procedure.
it
is
not
going
to
have
an
irreversible
traumatic
affect
on
the
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
source
of
the
court's
power
to
order
the
state
of
georgia
to
spend
money
for
this
project.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
they
did
command
them
to
spend
money.
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
his
morning
in
number
1690,
parham
against
several
minors.
mr.
lackey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
need
to
stand
on
only
the
second
leg,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
certainly
agree
that
we
don't
--
it's
not
necessary
to
get
to
that
to
resolve
it.
your
position
here
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
amended
states
doesn't
require
anymore
than
what
georgia
has
provided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
are
you
saying
that
it's
the
same
kind
of
deprivation
as
it
involved
different
in
degree
only
from
having
an
appendix
operation
or
a
heart
bypass
or
confinement
for
smallpox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
it
might
be
the
family
physician
who
was
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cromartie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
for
tubercolosis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
referring
to
tuberculosis
or
smallpox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
--
confined.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
confined.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
placed
there
by
his
parents
and
the
parents
say
to
the
doctors,
“if
you
keep
him
here
until
he
is
well
or
she
is
well
and
i
go
to
see
him
twice
a
week.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
statutes
with
--
in
most
states
requires
the
children
to
attend
school
for
certain
period
of
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
parent
decide
that
a
military
academy
is
the
best
place
as
many
parents
have
for
border
lining
courageable
children?
and
they
placed
him
in
a
private
military
academy
where
they
must
keep
rigid
hours,
they
can't
live
the
grounds,
a
whole
series
of
restraints,
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
it
possible
mr.
cromartie
that
a
child
that
is
someone
under
18
might
be
so
emotionally
disordered,
disturbed,
that
they
couldn't
participate,
they
couldn't
contribute
anything
in
the
same
sense
that
some
defendants
in
criminal
cases
are
determined
to
be
not
competent
to
assist
in
their
own
defense.
now,
is
that
possible
that
that
kind
of
a
situation
could
arise
with
a
seriously
disturbed
child,
age
16
or
15?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
can
be
psychotics
at
age
of
16,
can't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
psychopaths?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
assume
for
a
minute
that
you
have
the
very
seriously
disturbed
psychotic
psychopathic
person,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
first
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
whether
they
are
competent
to
assist
and
take
part
in
a
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
--
could
they
not
put
him
in
a
foster
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
the
state.
if
they
thought
something
less
than
institutional
care
was
indicated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
