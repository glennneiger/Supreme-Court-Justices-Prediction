justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
difference
between
mental
and
ordinary
hospitals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
example
in
the
mental
hospital
you
are
restrained.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
parent
has
right
to
restrain
the
child.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
how
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
not
restrain
the
child
entering
the
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
is
not
that
broad,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
you
do
recognize
the
difference
between
the
families
right
to
see
that
a
child's
tonsils
are
taken
out,
as
contrasted
to
being
committed
for
rest
of
his
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
physician
could
be
an
obstetrician?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
mean
obstetrician
can
say
this
child
is
dangerous
and
needs
mental
treatment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
therefore
got
to
--
well
he
is
in
still
an
obstetrician.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
the
law
in
georgia
is
on
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
before
they
can
be
released
from
the
hospital.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
want
you
to
get
out
of
what
you
did
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
you
could
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
mental
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
the
one
that
is
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
general--
why
not
to
narrow
it,
the
child
still
has
some
liberty
rights.
you
just
talked
about
the
one
liberty
that
is
involved
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
broadening
it
out
and
i
would
not
broaden
it
too
much.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
private
hospital,
it
also
a
subject
to
habeas
corpus,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
true
that,
in
the
average
case
the
only
qualified
psychiatrist
is
a
state
psychiatrist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
mean
that
the
ultimate
decision
as
to
the
mentality
of
the
child
is
made
by
the
state
doctors.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
say
that
harms
the
case,
no
but
that
is
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
have
to
mandamus
his
family?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
your
idea
be
of
be
of
an
adequate
hearing?
starting
out
you
need
a
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
state
psychiatrist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
not
have
that
at
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
is
it
the
bias
that
they
want
more
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
also
testified
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
get
two
psychiatrist
degree
on
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
the
parent
cannot
make
the
decision
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
who
can?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
has
decided.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
satisfied
with
the
person
the
state
has
picked.
the
state
has
already
picked
somebody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
have
protection,
they
could
have
got
no
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
want
to
put
that
extra
icing
on
it,
but
he
did
get
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
whom
should
speak
for
that
child
who
is
six
and
seven
years
old?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
would
that
be
brought
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
state
appoints
somebody
to
be
the
guardian,
you
could
not
go
buying
that
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
state
here
said
that
this
could
maybe
at
the
institution
who
shall
determine
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
you
tell
me
that,
that
is
wrong
and
i
wonder
why?
why
is
it
not
that
group
as
expert
as
the
parent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
question
of
insanity
and
mental
illness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
going
to
tell
to
turn
him
loose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
you
represent
to
say
what
the
child
did
or
did
not
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
two
children
that
are
named
plaintiffs
are
wrongfully
there,
they
are
two
other
ways,
you
could
have
gotten
them
out.
in
georgia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
did
you
not
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
your
basic
problem
of
equating
--
putting
a
person
in
a
mental
institution
indefinitely
would
go
in
on
a
hospital
overnight
from
tonsillectomy,
they're
two
different
animals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
everything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
what
--
it
would
be
a
more
walk
out
from
that
tonsillectomy,
even
if
it
worked
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
(voice
overlap)
--
i
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'll
equate
it
with
a
tonsillectomy
or
an
ingrown
toe
nail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
this
is
liberty.
we
need
to
lock
somebody
up
and
turn
the
key,
that's
liberty.
that's
a
basic
denial
of
liberty
in
any
sense
that
work.
will
you
turn
the
key
and
then
all
of
the
other
hospitals,
in
cases
you
mentioned,
you
don't
turn
the
key
on
to
the
person
being
locked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lackey,
i
don't
want
to
be
capricious
at
all
but
mentally
ill,
can
a
layman
determine
that?
isn't
it
another
phrase
you
want
to
see
appears
to
be
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
going
to
be
some
other
words
if
it's
mentally
ill.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
dose
the
evidence
show
the
existence
of
institutions
in
georgia
that
would
not
harm
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
were
institutions
available
in
georgia
that
could
treat
this
40
odd
children
satisfactorily
and
not
harmed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
--
your
institution
had
a
tuberculosis
sanitarium
where
the
state
commits
people
everyday.
they
used
to
when
it
was
agreed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
walk
out
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
in
the
mean
time,
you
walked
around
spreading
your
germs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
a
state
is
powerless
to
stop
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
oh,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
assume
that
i
agree
with
what
you
say.
what's
going
to
happen
if
we
end
up
with
the
hearing
with
three
psychiatrists
on
one
side
and
three
on
the
other,
then
what
does
the
court
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
tried
to
make
one
with
three
psychiatrists
on
one
side
and
three
on
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
haven't
tried
it,
you'd
be
committed?
