justice

his
writing
in
the
middle?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
any
of
them,
three,
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
have
a
date
or
something
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
kind
of
intensive
care
unit
do
you

out
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
an
office
or
something?
justice
thurgood

at
some
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
at
some
time
--
have
you
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
that
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
that
place
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
exception
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
don't
need
a
search
warrant
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
they
find
in
the
search
that
affected
the
murder
scene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
found
in
the
first
night.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
did
they
find
five
nights
later
that
applied
to
the
murder?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
--
in
the
(inaudible)
of
arizona
you
can
call
up
and
get
a
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
we
do
have
a
telephone
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
a
telephone
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
we
do
have
a
telephone
sketch
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
might
not,
your
honor.
you
may
be
able
to
get
one,
yes,
but
what
i
would
also
answer
is
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
bodies
would
you
need?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
had
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
well
the
man
is
serously
injured.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
came
to
the
hospital,
you
just
stay
right
there
and
if
--
a
week
later
he
dies
and
then
it
becomes
homicide?
(voice
overlap)
sir,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
he
knew
--
he
had
been
dead
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
me
tell
you
(inaudible)
now
the
easy.
you
–
the
–
do
you
come
in
the
room
and
there's
a
man
shot,
bleeding
and
could
be
dying
then
his
holding
he's
hands
two
keys,
one
is
to
a
locker
and
one
is
to
a
briefcase.
he
can
go
to
the
airport,
take
out
the
briefcase,
and
look
in
the
briefcase.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
this
would
determine
the
--
the
police
officer
makes
the
judgment.
and
if
he
find
some
contraband
that
makes
it
legal,
if
he
doesn't
find
it
he's
just
--
he's
sorry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
way
it
applies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said,
“oops,
i
made
a
mistake.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
general
view,
this
is
not
the
police
officer,
it's
--
it's
the
trained
detective
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
by
that
time?
it
can
be
or
it
could
not
be.
it
just
depends
on
the
--
you
know,
if
you're
in
a
small
town
in
bisbee
or
something
like
that,
you
may
not
have
--
you
know
--
a
real
sophisticated
officer.
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
is
here
is
the
fact
that
where
you've
got
policers
that
are
lawfully
on
the
scene
if
something
like
this
occurs,
the
expectation
to
privacy
that
the
defendant
has
here
is
extremely
limited.
there's
very
little
there
because,
you
know
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
a
dead
body
here.
the
officers
are
there
lawfully
on
the
scene
and
the
fact
that
they
walk
through
or
whatever
they
do
the
intrusion
against
the
petitioner's
rights
are
going
to
be
extremely
limited.
finally,
we
would
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable
test
and
this
is
--
the
one
just
built
on
common
sense
is
that,
renya
should
have
been
allowed
when
he
came
in
to
that
apartment
to
have
gone
through
with
the
search
the
way
he
did,
that
he
should
have
been
allowed
to,
you
know
start
marking
the
evidence
where
he
found
this
or
when
he
was
going
to
reconstruct
the
crime,
he'd
know
where
--
let's
say,
the
telephone
was
or
where
the
--
the
chair
was
or
you
know
where
the
bullets
were
so
he
could
--
you
know
--
plot
the
projectory
of
the
--
of
the
shells
or
--
so
he
could
prepare
what
had
happened
when
they
went
to
trial.
and
that
this
is
something
that's
really
built
on
common
sense
to
allow
a
police
officer
to
conduct
an
immediate
search
here
when
he
gets
on
to
a
murder
scene.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
besides
the
situation,
they
only
notify
homicide,
whether
somebody
dies
or
not.
