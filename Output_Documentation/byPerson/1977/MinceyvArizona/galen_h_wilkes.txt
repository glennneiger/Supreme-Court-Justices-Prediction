mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court.
today,
i'd
like
to
divide
my
argument
up
into
two
segments.
the
first
argument
i'd
like
to
deal
with
is
the
issue
of
the
search.
and
to
begin
with,
i
think
it's
extremely
important
to
look
at
some
of
the
facts
that
were
present
there
at
the
apartment
back
in
october
28th
of
1974.
the
officers,
to
begin
with
were
lawfully
inside
the
petitioner's
apartment.
one
of
their
member,
mr.
headricks,
had
just
been
into
the
apartment
and
had
observed
heroine
in
the
apartment.
the
petitioner
had
showed
him
heroin
and
offered
to
sell
it
to
him.
the
officer,
officer
headrick
said
that
he
wanted
to
purchase
the
--
the
heroin
and
that
he
was
going
to
go
outside
to
his
money
man
to
get
the
money
and
come
back
and
purchase
the
heroin.
officer
headricks
left
the
apartment,
walked
out
to
the
parking
lot,
saw
a
--
detective
schwartz,
all
this
time,
what
had
been
transpiring
in
the
apartment
had
been
broadcast
to
the
other
police
officers.
he
was
telling
him,
“i've
seen
the
heroin.
i've
ran
the
test.”
and
the
detective
who
was
in-charge,
lieutenant
fuller
said,
“everybody,
meet
up
here
at
apartment
211
for
this
raid.”
so
they
went
back
up
to
the
apartment.
the
officer,
officer
headricks,
knocked
on
the
apartment.
there
was
his
friend,
detective
schwartz,
was
standing
to
his
left.
the
door
was
opened
by
hodgman.
as
the
door
was
opened,
headricks
said
something
with
the
word
police
in
it.
the
door
was
opened.
he
started
in,
hodgman
pushed
the
door
shut
and
headricks
burst
on
in.
schwartz
had
his
shoulder
in
the
door.
there
was
a
testimony
that
he
at
that
time
said
police,
police
officer
or
something
of
this
nature
and
then
schwartz
and
lieutenant
fuller,
who
was
behind
him,
got
into
the
apartment.
by
this
time,
officer
headricks
was
into
the
bedroom
where
the
shooting
took
place
and
that
about
this
time,
the
shooting
does,
in
fact,
take
place.
lieutenant
fulller
looks
up
into
the
hallway
of
this
small
apartment.
this
is
not
a
real
large
apartment
here
that
we're
talking
about.
this
is
just
a
small
one-bedroom
apartment.
he
looks
up
in
the
hallway
which
to
the
left
would
be
the
bathroom
and
to
the
right
would
be
the
bedroom
and
he
sees
ferguson
there
in
the
hallway.
he
goes
up
to
ferguson,
puts
him
up
against
the
door,
up
against
the
wall.
about
this
time
the
bullets
start
to
--
to
fly
into
the
--
from
bedroom,
the
shots
begin
and
within
a
matter
of
seconds
the
shooting
is
all
over
with.
when
the
shooting
is
over
with,
detective
headricks
comes
out
of
the
bedroom
and
falls
down,
goes
down
in
the
hallway.
he
says,
“i'm
down,”
or
something
of
this
nature.
the
other
policemen
go
into
the
bedroom.
two
of
them
go
in
and
they
see
the
petitioner
behind
the
bed.
then,
the
other
agency
has
called,
that
is
homicide
is
called
and
the
area
is
secured.
now,
this
is
what
faced
officer
renya
when
came
to
the
apartment
back
in
that
time
in
october.
he
came
into
a
bullet-ridden
apartment.
there
were
bullet
holes
in
the
wall.
there
was
blood
on
the
floor.
there
was
broken
glass
from
the
acardia
door
that
was
in
the
living
room.
it
was
on
the
floor.
there
were
guns
on
the
floor.
there
was
some
blood
on
the
wall.
there
was
--
you
had
wounded
people.
you
had
officer
headricks
who
was
being
removed.
you
had
a
--
this
charles
ferguson
here,
he
had
been
shot
in
the
head
and
he
was
lying
in
the
hallway
like
--
and
his
blood
was
there.
you
had
a
wounded
girl
who
was
in
the
bedroom
closet.
she
was
in
there.
she
had
been
shot
at
least
twice.
the
police
officer
testified
in
the
forearm
and
in
the
hip.
i
believe
the
doctor
later
testified
at
trial
that
she
had
a
--
an
injury
in
the
area
colon.
so
you
had
all
of
these
serious
injured
people
there
including
the
petitioner
here.
so
without
a
search
warrant,
and
pursuant
to
the
policy
that
was
followed
by
the
tucson
police
department,
officer
renya,
eight
minutes
after
the
shooting
took
place
began
an
immediate
investigation
of
the
premises
--
search
of
the
premises
if
you
have
it,
to
determine
what
had
happened
there.
the
state
recognizes
that
this
court
is
held
on
many
occasions
that
--
you
know,
you've
got
to
get
a
search
warrant
before
you
can
go
in
and
have
a
search.
that
it's
unreasonable
if
you
don't.
but
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
there
are
exceptions,
such
as
border
searches,
stop-and-frisk,
exigent
circumstances
with
flinging
out
those
items
that
are
in
plain
view.
what
i'm
asking
you
do
--
to
do
here
today,
is
to
make
the
arizona
“murder
scene
exception”
another
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
which
requires
the
obtaining
of
a
search
warrant
prior
to
conducting
a
search.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
no,
your
honor,
we
haven't.
i
think
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
and
i
think
several
questions
come
--
come
to
mind
here.
the
first
question,
i
think
and
probably
the
most
important
is,
why
don't
we
need
to
get
a
search
warrant?
why
is
it
necessary
to
have
this
search
here?
why
was
it
necessary
for
officer
renya
to
begin
in
an
immediate
search
of
this
apartment
without
getting
a
search
warrant?
i
think
the
first
answer
to
this
is
the
fact
that
this
was
a
--
a
murder
scene.
he
came
in
there
and
some
of
the
blood
was
still
wet
when
he
got
in
there.
it
was
important
that
he
began
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
that
affected
the
murder
scene?
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay,
they
found
bullets
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
the
--
on
the
28th,
the
second
day,
they
did
dig
a
bullet
out
of
the
wall.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
--
i
can't
give
you
an
exact
time.
it
was
in
that
first
time
frame,
that
first
--
the
first
day
--
the
first
time
that
officer
renya
was
there
prior
to
going
home
on
the
evening
of
the
28th.
so
it
--
it
was
really
necessary
for
them
to
get
in
there
to
start
this
search.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
chimel,
there's
a
problem
there
because
i
--
i
think
that
we're
going
to
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
i
think
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
it
was
a
problem
when
i
read
this
and
did
this
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
can
be
approached
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
can
say
that
this
is
under
chimel
case.
this
is
in
the
case
where
you're
coming
in
and
going
to
arrest
a
man
for
--
you
know
some
--
of
a
breaking
into
a
coin
shop
here.
but
we're
heading
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes.
for
one
thing
here,
you
don't
know
--
lieutenant
renya,
here
didn't
know
what
he
was
facing
here.
you
know
you
had
this
blood
which
--
it
was
still
wet.
it
was
important
to
determine
--
you
know
--
the
cause
and
the
time
of
death
here.
when
you
had
this
blood
here,
it
was
important
to
--
to
get
into
this,
to
do
it
right
away.
another
case
where
we
had
a
problem
with
in
arizona
was
state
versus
skinner.
in
that
particular
case,
it
was
also
a
murder
case.
now,
it
wasn't
decided
on
the
“murder
scene
exception”.
but
when
the
police
officers
came
to
the
liquor
store,
they
--
they
found
a
cigarette
and
the
cigarette
was
partially
burnt.
and
they
used
this
cigarette
at
the
trial
to
help
establish
--
you
know
when
the
shooting
had
in
fact,
occurred
here.
and
you
don't
know
when
you
get
on
the
on
the
scene,
when
you
come
in
and
you
find
the
dead
body
here,
what
else
is
going
to
be
there
that
might
dissipate
you
--
or
what
might
disappear.
and
this
is
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
that
you
need
to
--
you
know
--
be
able
to
have
this
thorough
examination.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
at
this
point,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
officer
renya
had
enough
information
to
get
a
search
warrant.
he
came
in
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well
your
--
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
when
he
walked
in
the
door,
yes.
i
don't
think
a
police
officer
at
that
point
in
time
would
feel
comfortable
calling
up
in
getting
a
search
warrant.
he's
going
to
and
want
to
do
more
investigation
to
see
what
more
is
going
on.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
i
talk
--
i
took
the
time.
i
called
the
various
police
agencies
around
arizona
and
this
was
the
answer
that
they
got.
they
would
want
to
do
more
investigation
before
they
went
and
got
a
search
warrant.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
at
least,
as
far
as
when
you're
dealing
here
with
this
special
unique
situation
of
a
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
that's
correct.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
what
i'm
saying
here,
your
honor,
is
that
they
would
want
to
do
more.
they
would
want
to
get
a
better
foundation
other
than
when
officer
renya
came
in
and
he
see
these
on
the
floor
--
you
know
--
the
bullets,
the
bodies,
this
sort
of
thing
that
he's
not
going
to
want
to
get
a
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
no,
i
could
do
that.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
probably
one
would
be
sufficient,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
you
had
one
body
and
you
had
three
other
people
seriously
--
seriously
injured.
another
reason
here
in
--
is
the
fact
that
--
let
me
--
let
me
start
all
--
start
over
again
here.
it's
our
position
too
that
--
you
know
--
granted
you've
got
a
problem
here
but
if
you
could
go
in
and
you
could
make
that
initial
walkthrough
of
the
apartment
or
you
could
--
you
come
in
there
and
you
can
see
what's
on
the
floor.
if
that
initial
intrusion
is
okay,
then
why
--
it's
our
position
that
you
should
have
to
be
required
to
get
one
later
on
as
long
as
the
initial
intrusion
is
correct
here.
then,
it
shouldn't
be
necessary
to
somewhere
or
down
the
line
(inaudible)
now,
that
maybe
i've
got
two
bodies
here
or
maybe
i
found
this
much
more,
maybe
i
should
get
one.
it
seems
like
if
you
can
go
in
and
make
the
initial
search
here,
the
fact
that
you
don't
get
one
later
on
shouldn't
vitiate
the
whole
--
the
whole
search
here.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
chadwick,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
would
answer
you
this
way
your
honor.
is
that
if
you
would
--
if
you
agree
that
you
can
--
you
know
--
lock
up,
say
the
apartment,
to
keep
people
from
going
in
and
out.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
well,
you're
intruding
upon
this
petitioner's
rights
here.
you're
intruding
by
doing
that.
you're
--
you're
preventing
him
from
going
in
or
out.
it
seems
like
you're
--
you're
just
one
degree
further
in
--
in
intrusion
if
you
allow
the
offers
to
--
officers
to
go
around
and
to
make
the
search.
so
i
would
submit
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
you
can't
--
yes,
you
could
do
this
but
we're
--
we're
arguing
that
you
need
not
to
in
this
particular
situation
here.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right,
another
thing,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
at
this
point
in
time,
the
--
the
defendant's
expectation
of
privacy
has
really
been
diminished
just
about
to
nil
because
he
really
doesn't
have
that
much
to
--
to
lose.
here,
you've
got
a
man
who
shot
a
police
officer
five
times
or
shot
somebody
in
his
house
five
times.
he's
got
to
anticipate
that
somebody
is
going
to
come
in
there
to
investigate
what's
all
the
shooting
here
is
about.
he
can't
expect
that
these
people
aren't
going
to
do
anything.
he's
got
to
expect
that
someone's
going
to
come
in
here
and
try
to
determine
why
and
what
has
happened
here.
so
he
really
doesn't
have
that
much
expectation
of
privacy.
second
of
all,
well,
you've
got
a
situation
here
where
you
have
the
initial
intrusion
which
i
believe
is
lawful.
any
further
intrusion,
that
is
the
walking
through
here,
the
picking
of
the
bullets,
whatever,
this
--
the
--
this
other
intrusion
is
going
to
be
minor.
that
is
it's
not
going
to
be
a
bad
increase
by
allowing
the
officer
to
go
through
there
and
not
get
us
--
get
a
warrant.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
probably
was.
well,
yeah,
at
least
--
are
you
talking
about
the
--
the
drug?
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
no,
it
would
not
because
you
had
--
you
had
these
people
there
that
had
taken
place
in
this
drug
sale
here.
you
also
had
a
situation
where
a
police
officer
walked
into
a
--
on
a
bedroom
and
--
you
know
--
he
comes
out
shot.
and
you
go
in
there
and
you
find
the
gun
underneath
the
petitioner
and
you
find
another
lady
in
there
who
is
wounded.
so
i
think
--
you
know
--
you'd
at
least
have
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
petitioner
who
you
find
an
empty
gun
under
his
--
his
body
there.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
it
was.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right,
well
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
they
did
have
a
probable
cause
to
get
in
there
to
make
that
arrest.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
another
theory
that
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
and
i
think
another
important
reason
for
allowing
the
officers
to
make
this
search,
to
make
this
walk
around
in
the
apartment,
was
the
fact
with
the
humanitarian
aspect
of
it
here.
and
i
think
it's
very
applicable
here
because
had
they
not
walk
through
this
apartment,
they
may
not
have
found
this
deborah
johnson
who
is
laying
in
the
closet
in
the
bedroom
with
the
couple
of
bullets
in
her.
she
could
have
bled
to
death
there
because
we
--
you
know
--
she
might
not
been
able
to
call
out
for
help
or
whatever.
so
i
think
it
was
extremely
important
that
they
were
able
to
go
through
there
to
walk
through
this
--
this
apartment
here
because
this
--
you
know
--
i
want
to
emphasize
this
is
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
my
argument
again.
i
don't
mean
to
be
the
dead
horse
here
is
the
fact
that
if
the
initial
walkthrough
was
okay.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
in
this
particular
situation,
first
of
all,
after
the
defendant
--
after
you
come
in
there,
you've
found
all
these
bullets
on
the
floor,
you
--
you
found
a
dead
police
officer,
these
other
wounded
people,
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
defendant
is
just
about
nil.
the
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
under
our
rule,
yes
your
honor,
it
would.
well
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
a
homicide.
as
long
as
it's
a
homicide.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
wouldn't
think
so.
no.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well
i
--
i
think
you've
got
to
him
--
you
know
their
--
you
know
if
they
come
in
a
situation
like
the
one
we
had
here
today,
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
i
think
--
i
--
the
way
our
courts
would
interpret
it,
yes,
you
could.
that's
the
way
the
court
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes.
i
guess
--
if
that's
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
no
not
man
--
well,
as
long
as
there's
been
a
death,
a
homicide,
yes.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
the
arizona's
guideline
is
if
it
begins
within
a
reasonable
length
of
time.
and
i
would
--
you
know
--
if
it
looks
like
he
may
die,
our
courts
would
say
yes
because
they
say
–-
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
no.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
as
long
as
it's
going
to
try
and
to
determine
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
death,
yes.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
okay.
i
think
the
--
the
narcotics
went
--
in
the
murder
scene
--
and
the
murder
here
was
all
connected
together
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
narcotics
were
related
to
the
homicide
because
they
went
to
the
mode
of
the
--
of
the
shooting
itself.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
say
that
--
you
know
they
were
so
intertwined
here
that
the
fact
that
they
found
and
got
this
heroine.
it
was
okay
because
it
was
tied
up
with
the
--
of
the
shooting
because
it
was
a
--
a
drug-bust
that
they
were
there
for
originally.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes
your
honor
because
if
there's
a
likelihood
and
it
looks
like
the
person
may
die,
this
would
apply.
our
court
said
that
they
don't
want
to
limit
the
--
the
situations
where
the
person
is
saved
by
miraculous
medical
skills
of
the
physicians.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
think
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
as
long
it
--
you
know
--
as
long
as
it's
related
to
determining
the
circumstances
of
the
shooting,
i
think
that
you
could.
when
you
look
at
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
if
--
if
--
if
there
was
--
i
think
it
would
be
based
on
the
test
of
reasonableness
if
--
you
know
there
was
--
you
know
--
it
look
like
it
was
going
to
be
relate
to
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
in
one
of
the
murder
scene
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
in
one
of
the
murder
scene
exception
case
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
--
is
--
is
the
case
in
chapman
where
they
searched
the
basement
garage
or
the
lady
had
been
found
and
the
house
was
taken
away
along
with
the
defendant
and
they
came
back
later
on
and
the
officer
recalled
it,
has
seen
some
fecal
matter
on
--
some
clothes
that
were
in
--
i
think
the
corner
of
one
of
the
rooms
and
there
were
also
some
mud
and
they
followed
this
kind
of
trail
like
down
to
the
basement
garage
and
they
looked
into
a
trash
can
and
found
the
four
roses
bottles.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
think
so.
yes,
your
honor
because
he
does
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
--
i
was
answer
--
i
thought
i
was
--
i
was
trying
to
answer,
you
know,
the
searching,
the
briefcase
is
--
is
what
i
was
getting
to
--
you
now,
i
don't
think
you're
going
to,
you
know,
find
--
let's
say
maybe
a
wounded
person
in
there
but
you
could
find
out
a
wounded
person
in
the
closet
like
we
did
here.
and
so
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
no,
as
long
as
it's
related
to
determining
the
search.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
that's
right.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
as
long
as
it's
a
serious
injury
with
the
like
--
with
the
likelihood
of
death,
that
is
the
way
the
court
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
think
if
the
police
officers
come
into
a
situation
and
say
like
in
this
case,
the
man
had
two
bullet
holes
in
his
back.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
because
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
likelihood
that
he's
going
to
die
from
this
broken
arm.
you
know,
granted
it
could
happen
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
--
the
case.
so
i
don't
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes,
he
does.
and
you
know,
they
determined
it
on
the
spot
there
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
wouldn't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
i
think
that
you're
going
so
--
i
think
maybe
that
might
be
a
little
too
far
field
and
maybe
you
could
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
if
maybe
if
it
was
--
let's
say
a
drug
case
and
maybe
that's
where
the
drugs
were
and
the
--
and
the
reason
he
was
getting
shot
was
because
somebody
was
coming
to
buy
some
drugs
maybe.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
don't
think
so.i
think
what
you're
is
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
--
i
think
what
the
court
is
saying
is
whether
or
not
this
--
and
we
got
a
problem
of
hindsighting.
isn't
that
what
the
court
is
saying
here?
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
right.
i
think
one
of
the
--
the
advantages
or
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
rule
which
i
think
maybe
is
important
because
i
think
it
indicates
that
it
doesn't
violate,
you
know,
the
basic
reason
for
having
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
--
you're
not
going
to
have
general
searches
here
because
you're
going
to
have
this
officer,
he's
going
to
come
on
there,
and
he's
going
to
have
these
four
guidelines
which
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
set
down
here.
and
if
he
doesn't
fall
within
one
of
these
guidelines
here,
his
case
is
not
going
to
--
you
now,
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
his
evidence
and
that
he
--
that
he
wants.
the
--
the
same
is,
he's
going
to
have
to
make
--
making
the
search
relative
to
the
crime
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
i
would
think
it
would.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
with
these
prerequisites
here
that
you're
not
going
to
have
this
fishing
expedition
because
your
search
is
going
to
be
limited
to
the
circumstances
of
the
death
here.
and
where
you've
got
these
fourth
prerequisites
here
set
down
by
the
court,
i
think
this
is
something
that
the
police
officer
on
the
beat
will
be
able
to
follow.
this
is
something
that
he
can
tell
whether
he's
got
one,
two,
three,
and
four
and
--
mr.
galen
h.
wilkes
they're
set
out
in
the
supreme
court's
decision
by
justice
gordon
under
this
particular
argument.
