mr.
richard
oseran
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
richard
oseran
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
rufus
mincey.
this
case
concerns
the
trial
court's
admission
in
arizona
supreme
court's
affirmation
of
what
the
petitioner
contends
to
be
unlawfully
seized
evidence
in
an
inadmissible
statement.
the
first
question
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
a
compelling
need
to
permit
a
warrantless
general
search
at
the
scene
of
certain
suspected
crimes
specifically
a
possible
homicide
or
crime
involving
a
serious
bodily
injury,
where
there
is
no
exigency
and
there
is
ample
time
to
obtain
a
warrant
without
frustrating
the
purpose
of
the
search.
the
second
question
concerns
whether
a
statement
made
by
the
petitioner
in
the
intensive
care
unit
of
a
hospital
in
violation
of
miranda
was
involuntary
or
untrustworthy.
and
if
neither,
whether
his
testimony
at
trial
was
perjurious
to
render
his
statement
admissible
for
any
purpose.
mr.
richard
oseran
no
your
honor.
the
--
one
of
the
counts
was
sale
and
if
the
--
you
ruled
for
me
on
the
first
question
would
be
the
unlawful
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that
would
suppress
narcotics
that
were
seized
but
there
doesn't
have
to
be
narcotics
for
the
crime
of
offer
to
sell
or
sell
to
be
--
to
have
been
committed
and
therefore,
the
second
question
would
still
be
an
issue
in
the
second
trial
on
that
charge.
mr.
richard
oseran
well,
your
honor
there
were
three
--
the
statement
was
used
in
three
different
instances
to
impeach
the
petitioner.
it
affected
his
credibility
before
the
jury
and
his
credibility
is
intertwined
between
all
of
the
counts
as
to
what
there
opinion
is
of
his
truthfulness.
and
at
least
in
one
of
those
instances,
it
was
--
involved
the
direct
comment
on
his
silence
which
again
goes
to
his
credibility
which
was
a
factor
that
may
well
have
been
before
jury
and
its
decision.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
agree
--
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
statements
are
part
of
the
--
the
drug
convictions.
i
will
initially
confine
the
facts
and
argument
to
the
first
question.
on
october
28,
1974,
nine
undercover,
disguised
police
officers
and
a
county
attorney
forced
entry
into
the
petitioner's
residence
by
means
of
ruse.
the
armed
plainclothed
officer,
the
first
one
and
ran
straight
back
to
the
bedroom
where
the
petitioner
was
and
where
his
girlfriend
lay
sleeping.
gun
fire
erupted
immediately
leaving
four
people
seriously
wounded;
the
petitioner,
the
girlfriend,
the
disguised
officer,
and
one
occupant
of
the
apartment
that
was
struck
by
a
bullet
that
came
out
from
the
wall
of
the
bedroom.
the
entire
incident
transpired
and
was
completed
within
a
matter
of
seconds
of
entry.
the
scene
was
secured.
there
was
no
search
or
no
seizure
at
that
time.
the
wounded
were
transported
to
the
hospital
and
investigating
officers
arrived
and
conducted
a
search
that
lasted
for
four
days
without
the
benefit
of
warrant
and
they
seized
between
two
and
300
items.
the
fourth
amendment
prescribes
warrantless
searches.
this
court
has
continually
held
that
warrantless
searches
are
per
se
unreasonable.
necessity
compels
certain
exceptions
but
there
was
no
necessity
here.
an
immediate
search
was
not
imperative.
the
residents
had
been
secured
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
exhaustive
search
and
the
purpose
of
the
search
would
not
have
been
frustrated
by
the
officers
attempting
to
obtain
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
don't
think
that
what
was
seen
in
--
if
they
were
lawfully
there,
and
we
contend
that
they
weren't
but
that's
not
before
in
this
court.
if
they're
lawfully
at
a
certain
place
where
they
can
see
in
plain
view,
i
think
it
would
not
be
pursuant
to
a
search
and
those
items
would
be
admissible
into
evidence.
mr.
richard
oseran
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
but
they
were
no
narcotics
in
plain
view.
the
narcotics
were
the
result
of
a
much
more
intrusive
search
that
went
into
drawers,
and
cabinets,
and
pockets
of
clothing
and
not
on
the
petitioner
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
oseran
that
there
is
no
challenge
at
this
point
in
time
before
this
court
but
there
may
well
be
a
challenge
if
--
mr.
richard
oseran
when
we
go
back
to
trial
on
whether
or
not
the
entry
was
lawful.
but
assuming
for
--
for
purposes
of
argument
here
that
the
entry
was
lawful,
then
what
seen
in
plain
view
would
not
be
the
result
of
this
search
and
it
would
be
admissible.
it
was
the
--
the
more
intrusive
search
that
i'm
directing
my
argument
toward.
there
was
no
reasonable
or
rational
basis,
although
the
respondent
contends
otherwise
that
a
search
was
needed
for
the
detection
or
solution
of
the
crime
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
the
rationale
of
the
suspected
crime
scene
emergency,
if
it's
viable
here
then
it's
viable
at
the
scene
of
all
crimes
in
the
principles
of
personal
security,
personal
privacy,
and
private
property,
as
well
as
personal
liberty
would
be
sacrificed
along
with
the
fourth
amendment.
after
the
shooting,
the
wounded
were
removed
to
the
hospital
as
was
the
petitioner.
upon
arrival
at
the
hospital,
he
was
depressed
near
to
the
point
of
coma.
he
was
breathing
insufficiently
and
he
was
partially
paralyzed.
he
was
--
three
hours
later
detective
hust
of
the
tucson
police
department
went
to
the
intensive
care
unit
of
the
hospital
to
interrogate
him.
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
asleep
at
that
time,
the
detective
didn't
recall,
but
he
found
him
in
a
condition
with
an
intratracheal
tube
going
down
in
his
mouth,
down
his
throat
into
his
lungs
to
aid
and
in
--
the
--
in
his
breathing.
and
this
is
used
for
critical
patients
rather
than
just
a
face
mask
with
oxygen.
he
also
had
a
tube
up
his
--
through
his
nose,
down
his
throat
into
his
stomach
preventing
the
aspiration
of
vomit
so
he
wouldn't
choke
to
death.
obviously,
he
was
not
able
to
--
to
speak
in
this
condition.
virtually,
there
were
tubes
and
needles
running
in
and
out
of
every
orifice
in
his
body.
the
interrogation
began
at
about
8:15
in
the
evening
and
continued
until
11:20.
appendicized
to
our
brief
where
the
six
pages
of
responses
made
by
the
petitioner
which
certainly
suggest
that
it
was
a
laborious
and
slow
going.
after
some
small
talk
--
mr.
richard
oseran
it's
not
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
think
the
duration
of
the
interrogation
under
the
circumstances
and
with
the
other
factors
that
i
intend
to
present
to
the
court
have
a
bearing
on
voluntariness,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
she
was
the
nurse
on
duty
your
honor.
she
authorized
the
interrogation
and
she
encouraged
the
--
the
petitioner
to
cooperate.
however,
she
did
not
read
what
he
had
written.
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
requesting
that
the
interrogation
be
seized
or
that
he
wanted
the
attorney
present.
there
are
notations,
other
notations
in
the
--
the
--
on
the
responses
on
this
hospital
paper
in
the
margins.
there
was
a
testimony
at
the
trial
by
the
officer
that
he
made
those
notations
the
following
morning.
however,
on
sunday
preparing
to
come
before
this
court,
i
went
back
and
--
and
decided
i
needed
a
bigger
or
larger
copy
of
the
statements
and
went
to
my
file,
and
at
that
time
discovered
that
--
that
these
renderings
of
the
officer,
that
he
indicated
he
put
on
two
days
later
did
not
exist
on
the
copies
of
the
statement
that
i
had.
i
received
the
copies
from
the
prosecutor
pursuant
to
an
arizona
rule.
these
statements
are
also
part
of
the
record
and
i
--
i
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
re
--
to
request
that
record
concerning
these
statements
or
containing
these
statements.
it's
the
disclosure
provided
by
the
prosecutor
to
me
and
i
have
provided
him
with
disclosure
to
permanent
part
of
the
record.
and
that
would
indicate
that
the
--
perhaps
there
were
some
altered
evidence
or
--
or
a
misstatement
by
the
officer.
i
would
receive
this
15
days
after
the
arraignment
which
would
indicate
that
at
that
point
in
time,
there
was
no
renderings
by
the
officer
on
the
statement.
mr.
richard
oseran
on
what
page
sir?
mr.
richard
oseran
the
--
yes,
it
is
his
writing
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
he
was
immobilized.
mr.
richard
oseran
that's
--
mr.
richard
oseran
that's
a
--
the
officer
came
to
interrogate
him
and
realized
he
couldn't
--
obviously,
the
officer
wasn't
prepared.
the
hospital
was
kind
enough
to
provide
the
officer
with
hospital
paper
for
the
interrogation.
how
he
was
able
to
write?
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
and
i
think
it's
just
because
of
the
minimum
amount
of
it.
but
it
would
have
been
at
the
--
a
great
hardship
to
him.
mr.
richard
oseran
it's
legible
writing
your
honor
but
--
mr.
richard
oseran
it's
more
legible.
it's
more
legible
than
mine
as
well
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
how
legible
it
is,
is
any
indication
of
whether
it
was
psychologically
coerced
or
not.
mr.
richard
oseran
that
was
the
description
given
by
the
doctor
in
the
testimony
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
would
imagine
he
could
have
succumbed
then
passed
away
after
he
printed
this
--
if
he
prints
in
a
--
a
normal
--
normal
handwriting.
i
realized
--
mr.
richard
oseran
no,
your
honor.
he
was
in
a
coma
or
at
near
coma
at
the
time
he
was
admitted
into
the
hospital
three
hours
previously.
he
had
been
administered
some
drugs
and
so
forth.
at
that
point
his
condition
was
still
critical
and
he
was
in
the
intensive
care
unit.
but
i'm
sure
it
stabilized
the
--
mr.
richard
oseran
there
are
your
honor.
but
of
course,
they're
only
definitive
if
--
in
light
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
to
him
and
there
was
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
oseran
sir?
mr.
richard
oseran
exactly
your
honor.
but
we
don't
really
know
what
the
questions
were
and
the
responses
only
have
meeting
--
meaning
in
light
of
what
the
questions
may
or
may
not
have
been.
the
officer
didn't
memorialize
the
questions
he
asked
for
seven
days.
and
at
that
point
in
time,
he
held
the
responses
in
his
hand
in
sort
of
--
it
was
like
filling
in
the
blanks.
so
they
may
or
may
not
be
definitive
but
you
can
only
tell
if
you
know
what
the
--
what
the
questions
were
in
fact
at
the
time
they're
hearing
on
this
matter
he
was
given
just
the
responses
and
asked,
“you
officer,
you
fill
in
the
questions.”
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
do
it.
he
couldn't
do
it
without
that
which
he
had
--
he
had
prepared
utilizing
the
responses.
the
officer,
after
some
small
talk
advised
the
petitioner
that
he
had
killed
the
police
officer.
he
then
read
his
--
read
him
his
rights.
the
petitioner
describes
some
threats
and
intimidations
that
were
made
to
him
after
the
shooting
on
the
scene
and
then
invoked
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
compelled
testimony
of
the
accused
to
be
used
for
any
purpose.
the
statement
of
the
petitioner
made
in
the
intensive
care
unit
of
the
hospital
was
involuntary
for
the
--
and
untrustworthy
for
the
following
reasons.
he
was
in
critical
condition,
he
was
in
an
unbearable
pain,
and
he
advised
the
officer
that
he
made
six
attempts
to
invoke
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
and
it
was
clear
to
him
as
it
would
be
at
any
man.
but
the
questioning
was
not
going
to
cease
and
an
attorney
was
not
going
to
be
provide
him
--
provided
for
him.
eight
times,
he
told
the
officer
how
confused
and
uncertain
he
was.
he
had
been
administered
narcan
which
we
learned
from
the
respondent's
brief
causes
acute
withdrawals
in
an
addict
which
he
was.
he
was
prompted
by
his
nurse
to
cooperate
as
i
spoke
about
a
moment
ago.
he
had
no
prior
experience
with
the
police
or
other
judicial
officers.
aside
from
his
own
injuries,
he
just
--
he
was
in
shock
because
he
had
learned
he
was
charged
with
murder
and
that
he,
in
fact,
had
murdered
a
police
officer
and
his
girlfriend
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
encounter.
he
was
accused
by
the
interrogator
of
lying
and
the
interrogator
untruthfully
told
him
that
others
were
making
statements
inconsistent
with
his.
he
was
exhausted
but
the
interrogation
did
not
cease
except
when
he
appeared
physically
unable
to
go
on.
the
interrogator
then
would
leave
and
return.
the
petitioner
didn't
even
know
that
it
was
the
same
person
coming
back
over
and
over
again.
his
will
was
overborne.
the
statements
were
the
result
of
the
court
--
a
coercive
of
atmosphere
he
found
himself
in.
they
were
involuntary
and
untrustworthy.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
his
responses
only
have
meaning
in
light
of
the
questions
that
were
asked.
the
questions
were
not
reconstructed
for
seven
days.
the
responded
contends
that
at
most,
this
was
a
violation
of
miranda
and
that
the
statement
was
voluntary,
trustworthy,
and
admissible
for
impeachment.
but
the
statement
made
in
violation
of
miranda
would
only
be
admissible
for
limited
purpose
if,
in
fact,
it
was
elicited
on
direct
examination
and
if
it
was
perjurious.
there
was
no
perjury
here
and
the
prosecutor
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
that
implication.
at
most,
there
was
some
ambiguity
of
the
three
responses
that
the
prosecutor
sought
to
impeach
too
who
were
elicited
by
him
on
cross-examination.
and
one,
which
can
be
found
on
the
appendix
of
page
88,
was
a
comment
on
his
silence.
the
questioning
on
cross-examination
by
the
prosecutor
was,
“you
didn't
tell
the
officer
hust
at
that
the
time
that
the
officer
shot
you
fist
did
you
mr.
mincey?”
his
response,
“he
didn't
ask
me.”
the
impeaching
question
then,
“he
did
ask
you
at
one
point
in
there
if
you
had
anything
else
to
add,
didn't
he?”
this
is
the
question
if
we
can
believe
the
officer's
construction
of
what
he
had
asked.
the
answer,
“yes
sir.
i
think
my
answer
at
that
time
was,
‘i
couldn't
say
anything
without
seeing
a
lawyer
first.”
in
fact,
what
the
question
and
answer
had
been
on
page
4(a)
of
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
in
pages
40
and
41
of
the
respondent's
brief,
“is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
tell
us?”
answer,
“if
it's
possible
to
get
a
lawyer
now,
we
can
finish
the
talk.”
he
was
also
was
attempted
to
be
impeached
by
a
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
it
was
a
bust
at
the
time
of
the
incident.
and
in
his
statement,
he
had
referred
to
it
as
a
bust
but
this
is
after
he
had
been
told
by
the
officer
that
it
was
a
bust.
it
was
also
after
the
time
when
he
said,
“which
one
was
the
police
officer?
was
he
the
one
in
cowboy
boots?”
who
in
fact
was
deceased
officer.
there
was
another
statement
elicited
by
me
on
direct
examination
regarding
whether
or
not
the
man
running
towards
the
bedroom
had
a
gun
in
his
hand.
who
was
impeached
on
cross-examination
with,
“i
can't
say
for
sure.
maybe
the
guy
had
a
gun.”
mr.
richard
oseran
that
he
saw
a
gun
in
the
man's
hand
that
was
running
towards
him.
mr.
richard
oseran
but
it
was
obvious
that
--
that
he
would
have
known
the
man
had
a
gun
because
that's
the
man
that
--
that
shot
him.
there
was
at
least
some
slight
ambiguity
but
there
was
--
mr.
richard
oseran
he
indicated
that
he
had
--
he
had
seen
--
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
right.
mr.
richard
oseran
right.
but
in
his
statement
--
mr.
richard
oseran
--
that
he
was
so
--
but
what
they
used
to
impeach
him
with
was
a
statement
that
he
didn't
know
whether
the
man
that
came
into
the
bedroom
had
a
gun.
well,
obviously
he
knew
the
--
the
deceased
officer
had
a
gun
because
at
that
time
he
knew
he
had
been
shot.
there
was
no
reason
for
not
obtaining
a
warrant.
the
evidence
submitted
against
the
petitioner
was
seized
unlawfully
and
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
the
statements
of
the
petitioner
made
in
the
intensive
care
unit
were
involuntary,
untrustworthy.
it
was
obvious
to
the
petitioner
that
his
rights
would
not
be
complied
with
by
the
officer
in
his
statements
where
the
--
where
the
--
where
the
result
of
his
overborne
will.
they
were
not
inconsistent
with
his
testimony
at
the
trial
and
should
not
have
been
admitted
for
any
purpose
in
that
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
that
regard
should
be
reversed
as
well.
mr.
richard
oseran
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
oseran
different
--
different
places.
i
believe
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
the
--
a
bottle,
whether
it
was
opaque
or
not,
i
don't
know
or
don't
recall
was
on
the
commode
which
would
not
have
been
in
plain
view
to
anybody
that
did
not
go
into
the
bathroom.
nobody
went
into
the
bathroom
until
the
apartment
had
been
secured
until
the
investigating
officers
arrived.
they
discovered
it
when
they
conducted
their
search.
mr.
richard
oseran
the
--
the
commode
was
around
the
corner.
they
--
mr.
richard
oseran
there
were
bullet
holes.
there
was
evidence
of
the
--
of
the
--
there
was
no
narcotics
or
evidence
in
plain
view,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
oseran
concerned
with
the
cases
that
we're
involved
with
today,
that's
correct
sir.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
your
honor.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
oseran
well,
it's
been
utilized
to
--
in
a
--
they
called
it
the
“murder
scene
exception”
about
five
or
six,
perhaps
seven
states.
but
in
most
of
these
cases
all
citing
one
or
two
cases
stevens
in
alaska
or
chapman
in
maine,
they
really
had
exigencies
and
they've
said
that
the
officers
had
a
lawful
right
to
be
there
and
what
was
seen
in
plain
view
only
in
one
or
two
cases
did
they
really
allow
an
intrusive
search
in
those
cases
that
we
would
submit
there
are
in
there
--
mr.
richard
oseran
briefly
your
honor.
mr.
richard
oseran
briefly,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
richard
oseran
well
then
i
--
i
--
he
did
mention
the
case
davis
--
skinner
if
it's
appropriate
for
me
to
go
in
to
that
case.
it
was
--
it
involved
more
than
what
he
represented
that
it
did.
it
also
involved
in
--
in
response
to
your
earlier
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
skinner
allows
impeaching
material
to
be
used
as
substantive
evidence.
so,
that
material
would
have
come
in
substantively
to
--
which
would
have
affected
his
creditability
as
to
all
accounts
and
that
they
were
all
tried
together
at
the
same
time.
additionally,
it
--
it
should
be
noted
that
the
officer
did
not
die
and
there
was
not
a
dead
body
in
the
apartment.
he
was
removed
even
before
the
investigating
officers
arrived.
mr.
richard
oseran
yes
sir,
i
--
i
certainly
do.
mr.
richard
oseran
that's
correct,
correct,
your
honor.
but
he
--
he
expired
at
the
hospital
and
any
four
people
could
have
died.
mr.
richard
oseran
that's
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
held.
in
fact,
if
i
may
--
mr.
richard
oseran
held
in
this
case
and
i've
set
those
--
there
are
--
quite
five
conditions,
not
four
conditions
and
they're
set
out
in
page
11
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
richard
oseran
i
can
recall
what
evidence
was
admitted
and
what
evidence
i'm
sure
would
be
again
at
the
retrial
--
mr.
richard
oseran
yes.
mr.
richard
oseran
well
there
was
300
items
seized
and
there
were
only
perhaps
less
than
30
or
40
items
that
were
admitted
at
the
trial
anyway,
so
right
away
we're
talking
about
reduced
percentage
of
all
the
items
that
we're
seized.
additionally,
i
feel
obligated
to
note
that
the
--
although,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
particular
issue
here.
one
person,
the
man
next
to
the
police
officer
who
initially
made
the
entry,
heard
the
officer
say,
“police”
or
something
like
that.
he
always
spoke
in
a
low
voice.
this
was
the
man
next
to
him.
there
was
testimony
from
everybody
that
was
inside
the
apartment
and
nobody
testified.
in
fact,
they
all
testified
that
they
did
not
hear
any
announcement
of
his
authority
or
purpose.
thank
you,
sir.
