justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
--
his
answer
at
the
trial
to
your
question
was
what?
just
affirmative
or
negative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
mean
he
was
seeing
the
gun.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
answered
to
your
question,
he
said
he'd
seen
the
gun
in
the
man's
hand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
said
he
didn't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
entry,
the
original
entry
was
for
the
purpose
i
suppose
of
making
a
drug
arrest,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
don't
have
before
us
now,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
make
that
entry
for
that
purpose.
but
certainly,
soon
the
--
most
of
us
thought
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
it
was
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
then
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
--
that
under
the
arizona
rule
they
could
not
search
the
briefcase,
are
you?
they
could,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
long
as
they
--
it's
--
it's
an
investigated
--
a
thorough
investigative
search
at
the
murder
scene.
and
that's
what
arizona
had
said
it's
for
--
quite
permissible
without
a
warrant,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
thought?
because
they
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
find
in
the
briefcase
until
they
open
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
need
to
tell
us
what
they
are,
but
where
are
those
four?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
four
conditions
of
it
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
brother
didn't
talk
about
the
self-incriminating
statements
at
the
hospital.
i
guess
we
could
rely
you'll
speak
for
that.
