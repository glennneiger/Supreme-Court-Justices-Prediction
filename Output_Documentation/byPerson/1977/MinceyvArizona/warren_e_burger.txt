we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
77-5353,
mincey
against
arizona.
mr.
oseran,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
have
this
clear,
you
said
there
is
--
did
i
understand
you,
there
--
there's
no
challenge
now
to
the
evidence
that
was
--
to
any
evidence
that
secured
on
the
day
of
this
gun
battle.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you're
in
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
that
--
so
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
bear
on
--
whether
it's
a
voluntary
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
who
--
i
take
it
to
these
notations
and
margin
on
the
statements
which
he
wrote
out
in
the
hospital
are
all
endorsements
by
the
nurses.
the
one
--
the
first
one
that
i
have
before
me
for
example
is
--
states,
“i
was
present
during
this
interview.”
and
he
gave
all
voluntarily
signed
elizabeth
graham,
rn,
presumably
a
registered
nurse
at
the
university
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
pretty
clear
writing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
much
more
legible
than
the
prosecuting
attorney.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
description
that
you
gave
--
of
his
--
being
in
a
near
coma.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
man
in
the
near
coma
could
have
printed
this
very
clear
printing
all
these
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
asking
you
at
that
time,
let's
assume,
you
can
assume
he
died
an
hour
later
if
you
wanted
to,
but
at
the
time
he
wrote
these
answers,
you
don't
suggest
that
he
was
in
a
coma.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
all
very
definitive
responses,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
they
needed
to
be
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
they
needed
to
be.
he's
responsive
to
the
questions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
evidentiary
material
in
plain
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wilkes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you
were
thinking.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
they
find
on
the
first
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay.
that's
where
you
found
the
narcotics,
you
found
the
bullets,
you
took
the
guns
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
after
the
shooting
were
the
narcotics
found?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
--
what
does
have
to
do
with
getting
the
warrant
as
the
questions
are
suggesting
to
you.
it's
--
it's
pretty
well-known
by
now
that
there's
been
lot
of
carnage
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
wouldn't
have
any
difficulties
sitting
down
and
then
15
minutes
writing
out
the
--
the
description
that
you've
given
us
in
15
minutes,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
and
if
you
did
that,
if
you
put
down
in
writing
what
you've
just
told
is
in
15
minutes,
would
you
have
any
difficulty
getting
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
answer
my
question?
would
you
have
any
difficulty
getting
a
warrant
on
what
you've
just
told
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with
chadwick
case
which
was
decided
in
the
last
preceding
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chadwick.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
it
wasn't
--
this
place
wasn't
all
of
the
evidence
that
once
the
bodies
have
been
removed.
wasn't
all
of
the
evidence
capable
of
being
made
absolutely
secured
by
the
presence
of
the
couple
of
officers
just
as
we
held
in
chadwick.
but
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
agents,
federal
agents
was
a
--
a
sufficient
barrier
to
a
search
without
a
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unlock
it
up
and
put
two
policemen
in
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
--
i'm
--
what
was
i
addressing
myself
to,
was
making
it
secure
just
long
enough
to
get
that
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
of
the
somewhat
unique
or
unique
arizona
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
homicide.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
you
tell
us
before
that
this
is
a
search
of
the
premises
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
an
automobile,
a
block
away
or
of
airport
to
a
mile
away.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
the
premises
were
the
homicide
or
probable
homicide
is
discovered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
oseran
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
were
quite
a
number
of
people
who
went
--
well
have
been
near
that
store,
don't
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
