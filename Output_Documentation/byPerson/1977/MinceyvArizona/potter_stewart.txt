justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
right
because
they
wouldn't
want
everybody
to
get
a
search
warrant.
that's
your
--
that's
your
submission,
so
naturally
they
would.
justice
potter
stewart
they
want
to
completely
investigate
everything
without
ever
getting
a
search
warrant.
that's
your
submission
and
actually
that's
what
the
police
want.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
telephone.
justice
potter
stewart
for
an
indefinite
period
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
homicide.
and
i
think
in
that
case
that
would
be
because
--
you
know
--
you
would
--
you
would
say,
“yeah.
it
was
an
accident.”
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
murder
scene
i
believe
that's
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
saying.
right,
it's
a
murder
scene
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
murder
scene.
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
case
in
which
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
this
morning
is
in
number
77-5353
rufus
jr.
mincey,
petitioner
against
the
state
of
arizona.
a
case
that
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
an
arizona
trial
court
on
charges
of
murder,
assault,
and
three
counts
of
narcotics
offenses.
at
his
trial
and
on
appeal,
he
contended
that
evidence
used
against
him
had
been
unlawfully
seized
from
his
apartment
without
a
warrant
and
that
statements
used
to
impeach
his
credibility
were
inadmissible
because
they
had
not
been
made
voluntarily.
the
arizona
supreme
court
reversed
the
murder
and
assault
convictions
on
state-law
grounds,
but
affirmed
the
narcotics
convictions
rejecting
both
of
the
federal
constitutional
claims.
it
held
that
the
warrantless
search
of
a
homicide
scene
is
permissible
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
that
mincey's
statements
were
voluntary.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
these
substantial
constitutional
questions.
as
to
the
first
issue,
we
hold
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
so
called
murder
scene
exception
created
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
inconsistent
with
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
that
the
warrantless
search
of
mincey's
apartment
was
not
constitutionally
permissible
simply
because
a
homicide
had
recently
occurred
there.
as
to
the
second
issue,
we
hold
for
the
reasons
also
spelled
out
in
the
court's
written
opinion
that
mincey's
statements
were
not
the
product
of
his
free
and
rational
choice.
the
due
process
of
law
requires
that
statements
obtained
as
these
were
can
not
be
used
in
anyway
against
a
defendant
at
his
trial.
for
these
reasons,
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
the
court's
written
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
