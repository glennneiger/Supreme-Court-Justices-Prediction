justice
byron
r.

are
you
positive
about
this?
i
share
with
justice
rehnquist's
feeling
of
the
voluntariness
issue
that
bore
only
on
the
assault
and
murder
counts.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
make
it
sound
awfully
--
and
i
--
this
was
an
awfully
complicated
and
a
--
and
quite
a
--
quite
a
--
quite
an
apparent
--
but
let's
just
think
it
--
to
make
it
simple.
“a
man
calls
up
because
i
had
just
shot
my
wife.
come
and
arrest
me.”
and
the
police
come
and
they
come
in
and
they
arrest
him.
and
i
--
i
think
that
you
suggest
that
right
then
and
there,
the
wife
is
lying
there
dead
just
like
he
says.
the
police
make
their
undertaking,
a
complete
search
of
the
household.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
doesn't
chimel
bar
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
there's
a
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
are
you
having
a
problem
with
chimel?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
arresting
him
for
murder
now
and
you're
saying
that
you
can
make
as
broad
search
as
you
want
in
a
four-day
alignment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
the
officer
could
stay
there
until
they
got
a
search
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
mr.
wilkes
that
argument
doesn't
justify
four
days
in
(inaudible)
drawers
and
of
that
sort
of
thing
though
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
follows
they
open
drawers
and
go
through
briefcases
and
all
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
what
sort
of
situation
does
this
arizona
apply
this
exception?
supposing
someone
came
into
my
home,
and
i
went
downstairs,
and
--
and
there
was
some
kind
of
a
ruckus,
and
i
shot
him
and
killed
him.
and
then
the
police
--
i
called
the
police.
the
police
were
suspicious
that
i'd
murdered
him.
would
that
be
enough
to
justify
searching
the
whole
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
supposing
i
said
it
was
a
self-defense.
is
it
a
“murder
scene
exception
or
a
killing
scene
exception”
whenever
anybody
is
killed
is
it
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
accidental
death
would
do
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
when
it's
a
homicide?
is
an
accidental
death
a
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
--
what
if
the
man
says
it's
an
accidental
death?
how
do
the
police
know
whether
they
can
search
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yours
is
easy,
but
you
know
you're
really
trying
to
find
what
rule
you're
asking
as
deductive.
you
walk
in
to
a
house,
somebody
is
dead
on
the
floor,
another
person
says,
“i
shot
him
by
mistake.”
can
the
police
search
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
it
does
apply
to
accidental
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
a
“murder
scene
exception”.
it's
an
accidental
death
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
homicide,
murder,
man
slaughter.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
well,
i
guess
it
didn't
have
to
a
homicide
if
i
mislead
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
scope
of
the
searching
authorities?
was
it
plenty
of
room
mansion?
did
he
search
the
whole
mansion?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
all
of
this
search
devoted
to
the
murder
issue
or
some
of
it
to
narcotics?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
there
are
two
primes
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
narcotics
and
murder.
and
much
of
the
search
concerned
the
narcotics
transactions,
did
it
not?
does
the
“murder
scene
exception”
justify
the
search
for
evidence
of
the
narcotics
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
just
to
ask
you
--
ask
you,
what
if
you
--
what
if
you
--
what
if
the
bodies
in
the
living
room
and
there's
a
--
the
bedroom
door
is
shut.
and
there's
no
suggestion
whatsoever
to
anybody
that
you
might
find
something
in
the
bedroom,
may
the
officer
enter
the
bedroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
--
whether
there's
some
indication
that
that
you'll
find
something.
you're
just
running
an
--
an
investigatory
search.
