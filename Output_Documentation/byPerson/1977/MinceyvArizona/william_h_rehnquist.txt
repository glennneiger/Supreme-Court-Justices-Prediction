justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
rule
for
you
on
your
first
point
of
the
arizona
scene
of
murder
exception,
wouldn't
that
more
or
less
mood
out
the
second
point
or
at
least
make
in
a
or
make
a
report
of
what
we
said
on
an
advisory
opinion
since
as
i
understand
that
the
hospital
conversations
were
used
only
in
the
murder
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
you
agree
that
all
we
should
review
here
were
questions
that
are
properly
raised
in
the
drug
conviction
and
that
we
should
not
review
questions
that
relate
only
to
the
murder
conviction
which
was
remanded
by
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
even
though
they
had
stayed
only
10
minutes
and
only
tried
to
ascertain
whether
the
person
was
in
fact
dead
and
look
immediately
around
the
body,
it's
--
it
still
would
have
required
a
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
--
you've
got
a
case
where
the
search
extended
over
a
period
of
four
days
as
i
understand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
well
the
court
could
considerably
rule
in
your
favor
on
the
duration
of
the
search
and
nonetheless
conclude
that
the
officers
were
lawfully
on
the
property
in
the
very
first
instance
(voice
overlap)
--.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
--
your
--
aren't
you
kind
of
contradicting
yourself
to
a
certain
extent
when
you
say
on
one
hand
that
these
are
--
it
should
be
justified
as
an
exigent
circumstance.
you
know
--
things
are
happening
so
fast
that
a
--
at
least
in
order
to
find
out
who's
dead,
and
who's
alive,
and
evidence
in
plain
view.
once
you
have
reasonable
cause
and
think
there
is
a
homicide,
you've
got
a
right
to
enter
the
premises.
but
then
you
--
you
said,
you
don't
think
the
police
would
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
five
to
four
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
any
of
these
people
on
your
opinion
at
that
time
that
officer
renya
arrived
on
the
scene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i'm
trying
to
reflect
a
little
bit
on
your
--
on
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
first
about
securing
the
premises.
i
take
it
simply
securing
the
premises
and
letting
all
of
the
people
who'd
been
on
the
premises
go
would
not
have
sufficed
for
purposes
of
adequate
law
enforcement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
oseran,
have
you
made
any
attempt
to
discern
for
yourself
how
much
of
the
evidence
is
actually
admitted
at
trial
could
have
come
in
under
the
search
incident
to
arrest
a
plain
view
without
the
benefit
of
this
murder
scene
exception?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
murder
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what
percentages
we're
talking
about?
