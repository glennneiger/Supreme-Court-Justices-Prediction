justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
opinion
and
judgment
i
have
to
announce
actually
covers
two
cases.
both
of
them
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
both
of
them
involving
the
construction
and
application
of
the
interstate
detainer's
act,interstate
agreement
on
detainer's
act
more
technically.
in
one
of
these
cases,
76-1596,
united
states
against
mauro,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
when
issued
at
the
behest
of
the
united
states
to
secure
a
prisoner
for
trial
is
to
be
considered
a
detainer
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
if
it
is
the
protections
of
the
act
are
triggered
for
the
prisoner
and
those
protections
are
quite
substantial.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
the
writ
must
be
considered
the
detainer.
we
think
this
was
error
and
we
have
given
our
reasons
for
thinking
so
in
an
opinion
that
we
have
filed
and
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
in
76-1596.
on
the
other
hand
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
once
the
united
states
has
filed
the
detainer
against
a
state
prisoner,
the
subsequent
use
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
secure
his
production
is
a
request
for
his
custody
within
meaning
of
the
act
and
hence
in
those
circumstances
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
act.
we
accordingly
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
77-52.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
76-1596
and
dissenting
in
77-52.
