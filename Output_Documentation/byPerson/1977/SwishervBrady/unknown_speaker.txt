unknown
speaker
were
there
two
judges
and
seven
masters
in
baltimore
county?
unknown
speaker
still
an
order
is
entered
signed
by
the
judge
in
those
cases?
signed
by
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
that
reason
that
your
answer
to
my
brother,
marshall’s
first
questions,
there
is
nothing
that
state
can
do
if
the
judge
finds
no
delinquency
or
whatever
it
is,
as
you
said
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
double
jeopardy
law
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
juvenile
could
not
be
subjected
to
jeopardy
before
that
judge
for
the
same
offense
again.
unknown
speaker
what
point
do
you
fix
its
attachment?
unknown
speaker
even
before
he
signs
an
order.
unknown
speaker
but
he
can
remand
the
master,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
so
when
it
gets
to
the
judge
on
exceptions,
the
matter
is
voted
up
or
down
right
there?
unknown
speaker
if
the
state,
it
does
the
accepting
and
the
judge
finds
in
his
favor
on
his
exception,
the
show
is
over?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
sending
back
for
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
consistent
with
this
procedure
though
if
the
master
did
not
say,
i
find
you
not
guilty
but
said
johnny,
i
am
going
to
recommend
to
the
judge
to
find
you
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
well
let
us
suppose
he
did,
would
you
be
making
a
different
argument?
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
not
really
very
relevant.
unknown
speaker
could
a
juvenile
found
to
be
delinquent
by
master
and
when
the
state
agents
come
and
say
all
right
now
you
are
going
off
to
the
training
school
and
you
would
say,
“wait
a
minute.
i
filed
exceptions
to
the
master’s
recommendation”
then
would
he
still
go
to
the
training
school.
unknown
speaker
after
a
finding
of
delinquency.
unknown
speaker
90
percent.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
if
the
so
perfunctory
and
also
99.9
percent,
why
does
it
worry
anybody?
why
this
1983
suit?
unknown
speaker
you
have
emphasized
the
size
of
baltimore
city
but
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
an
attack
against
the
entire
system.
but
this
case
have
come
up
from
denton
for
example,
or
fredrick,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
would
you?
unknown
speaker
other
than
baltimore.
unknown
speaker
where
they
use
in
the
county
where
you
have
one
master
and
one
judge?
do
you
still
attack
the
system?
