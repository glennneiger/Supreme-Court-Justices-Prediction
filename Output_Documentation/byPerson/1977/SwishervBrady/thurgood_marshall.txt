justice
thurgood
marshall
coupling
along
another
thing,
it
is
the
same
judge
involved
in
the
counties
and
in
the
cities.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
i
mean
in
the
baltimore
city,
you
have
got
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
after
the
masterâ€™s
report,
it
goes
back
to
the
same
judge?
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
all
we
are
talking
about
is
one
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
one
point
along
the
other
one
i
asked,
if
the
judge
tries
the
case
without
the
master
and
says
i
find
no
evidence
of
guilt
and
i
acquit
and
i
release
or
whatever
the
ruling
is,
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
master,
i
think
that
is
a
point
they
will
decide
and
maybe,
if
the
master
recommends
that
he
be
released,
then
the
state
can
file
the
exception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
little
trouble
and
maybe
a
procedural
outright.
when
the
juvenile
is
brought
in
before
the
juvenile
judge,
why
is
he
in
jeopardy
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
beginning.
as
i
understand
you
said
the
judge
can
try
them
then
and
there,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
just
told
to
appear
before
the
magistrate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
magistrate
ask
him
if
he
is
guilty?
is
the
magistrate
to
ask
him
did
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
say
non-delinquent.
there
is
no
finding
of
the
guilt,
did
they
start
that?
you
do
not
find
the
child
guilty
or
not
guilty.
it
is
delinquent
or
not
delinquent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
not
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
been
that
the
master
sends
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
master
find
him
delinquent
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
master
sign
a
piece
of
paper
saying
that
this
man,
this
child
is
delinquent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
does
not
as
i
understand
he
recommends
that
the
judge
find
him
delinquent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
master
commit
him
to
training
school
until
his
of
age?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
my
question,
can
he
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
until
it
gets
to
the
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
did
not
answer
my
point.
is
there
any
way
that
the
master
can
punish
these
children?
any
way
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
just
said
it,
i
want
to
test
that
whether
you
would
stick
with
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
say
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
breed
v.
jones
controlled
this
case,
why
do
you
think
we
granted
certiorari?
