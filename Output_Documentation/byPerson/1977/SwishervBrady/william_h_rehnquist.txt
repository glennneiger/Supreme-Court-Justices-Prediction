what
would
happen
under
maryland
law
if
the
master
simply
by
mistake
failed
to
transmit
his
findings
to
the
juvenile
court
judge?
could
the
state
go
out
and
incarcerate
the
juvenile
on
the
basis
of
the
master’s
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
you
say
the
master
says
i
find
you
not
guilty.
i
got
the
impression
from
the
state’s
counsel,
the
master
makes
a
recommendation
to
the
juvenile
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
foreman
of
a
grand
jury
after
a
grand
jury
had
deliberated,
saw
the
defendant
standing
outside
the
grand
jury
room,
and
just
came
out
and
said
congratulations
we
have
just
found
you
not
guilty.
do
you
think
that
the
defendant
could
plead
that
in
bar
to
indictment
rendered
by
another
grand
jury
when
he
was
brought
to
trial
before
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
it
really
not
make
some
difference
here
whether
the
master’s
recommendation
is
something
on
which
the
state
could
base
punishment
of
the
child
or
whether
it
is
just
a
recommendation
to
a
judge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
winter
is
an
appellate
judge,
is
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
your
case
depend
to
any
larger
extent
on
the
perfunctory
nature
of
the
judges
that
review
supposing
following
up
the
chief
justice’s
question
that
each
judge
spent
three
hours
on
each
juvenile
case
that
the
state
unveiled
to
him.
just
considering
it
and
at
least
as
much
time
as
the
master
has
would
your
legal
position
be
any
different?
