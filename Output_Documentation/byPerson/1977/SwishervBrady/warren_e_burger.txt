chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
swisher
against
brady.
mr.
nilson,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
consequence
can
flow
from
the
master’s
action
before
the
judge
has
acted
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
final
disposition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
usually
in
custody
or
not
or
can
you
not
generalize?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
maryland,
did
you
ever
have
it
--
was
there
any
period
when
rather
than
having
masters
take
this
first
step
and
make
the
preliminary
inquiry,
this
was
done
by
interviews
at
the
hands
of
trained,
social
and
behavioral
professionals
who
were
not
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
time
when
it
went
directly
from
without
the
intervention
of
a
master,
from
this
professional
non-lawyer
however
to
the
juvenile
judge?
were
there
reports?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
certain
time
in
many
states
even
today
is
it
not
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
case
going
to
turn
on
whether
you
have
a
loud
mouth,
large
headed
master?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
suggest
though
because
if
he
presumes
to
pronounce
a
judgment
you
are
saying
that
makes
him
a
judge,
and
therefore
creates
jeopardy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
representing
to
the
court
that
all
seven
magistrates
at
the
conclusion
of
a
hearing,
where
they
are
going
to
recommend
under
the
procedure
no
further
proceedings,
that
they
all
make
the
announcement
of
you
are
not
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
the
judge
has
signed
any
piece
of
paper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
not
suggest
that
the
detention
of
the
child
before
the
master’s
hearing
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
does
it
become
somehow
unconstitutional
or
illegal
afterward
in
the
interim
between
the
master’s
recommendations
and
judge's
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
take
a
child
who
was
not
been
in
detention
but
has
been
at
home
and
a
considerable
number
are
released
to
the
custody
of
the
parents
is
that
not
so
or
to
a
foster
home?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
master
that
makes
his
recommendations,
are
you
telling
us
that
the
child
is
immediately
plucked
out
of
his
home
and
taken
to
a
detention
center
or
to
not
only
be
done
as
the
attorney
general’s
office
informed
us
after
the
judge
has
signed
something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supposed
you
had
three
judges
for
each
master
in
baltimore,
would
that
change
the
constitutional
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that,
do
you
mean
he
must
hear
a
de
novo
not
do
it
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
record
showed
that
the
spent
an
average
of
three
hours
on
each
set
of
recommendations
where
there
were
exceptions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court
occasionally
appoints
a
special
master
usually
it
is
on
a
matter
of
great
moment
and
if
there
are
no
exceptions
filed,
would
you
say
that
are
rather
peremptory
adoption
of
that
is
rubber
stamping
and
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
it?
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
about
the
masters
over
in
baltimore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
a
grand
jury
returns
an
indictment,
a
risk
arises
of
conviction
does
it
not?
some
apprehension
arises
on
the
person
indicted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
nothing
further,
mr.
nilson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
77-653,
swisher,
the
state's
attorney
for
baltimore
city
against
brady,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
joined,
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
