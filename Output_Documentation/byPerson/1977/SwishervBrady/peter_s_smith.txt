mr.
peter
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
state
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
a
child
is
tried
at
a
trial
and
we
will
talk
about
that
in
a
minute,
because
it
is
a
real
trial,
he
is
found
not
guilty.
witnesses
testify,
cross
examine,
arguments,
motions,
legal
points,
exhibits,
the
whole
bit,
all
pursuant
to
the
procedural
requirements
that
have
been
outlined
by
this
court
in
gault,
winship
and
to
some
extent
in
breed,
although
the
first
two
obviously
are
the
most
relevant.
at
the
end
of
it,
the
master
considers
his
decision
and
he
reviews
the
facts
and
the
law
and
he
says,
johnny,
i
find
you
not
guilty.
johnny
turns
to
his
mother
and
smiles
and
they
go
out
of
the
courtroom
and
everything
is
all
finished.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
both
of
those
statements
that
you
made,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
can
be
reconciled
and
perhaps
it
goes
to
the
real
heart
of
the
case
because
the
theory
of
it
is
that
a
paper
goes
to
the
judge
which
is
a
recommendation.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
but
he
does
not
do
that.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
i
would
not
be
making
a
different
argument.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
do
not
think
it
turns
on
that
at
all.
what
i
think
it
turns
on
is
what
in
fact
actually
happens.
at
the
conclusion,
the
record
incidentally,
supports
although
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
by
any
means
critical
to
our
ultimate
position.
nonetheless,
the
record
supports
the
characterization
of
what
the
master
says
that
i
just
indicated.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
three
masters
testified
in
this,
mr.
chief
justice
and
one
master
who
put
in
the
record
a
stipulation
of
evidence
indicated
that
he
completely
agreed
with
and
he
read
the
testimony
of
this
first
master
and
he
said
that
he
agreed
with
it
and
that
in
his
experience
as
an
assistant
public
defender,
before
he
was
appointed
to
master,
he
observed
this
going
on
in
every
single
master’s
courtroom
so
i
think
the
answer
is
the
record
does
support
that
it
happens
in
every
courtroom.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
technically
in
the
statute
of
course,
it
is
delinquent
or
not
delinquent.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
record
clearly
supports
this
that
the
master
explains
it
in
the
typical
criminal
lingo
because
obviously
a
child
is
not
going
to
understand
the
words
delinquent
or
non-delinquent.
now
after
the
decision,
after
without
trying
to
assume
the
conclusion
after
the
master
makes
the
statement
and
the
child
and
his
parent
leaves,
the
state's
attorney
decides
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
result.
he
thought
the
child
should
have
been
found
guilty
and
so
what
does
he
do,
he
files
an
exception
and
he
then
goes,
takes
out
exception
and
files
it
with
the
clerk
and
there
was
then
another
hearing
before
the
judge.
now,
it
used
to
be
that
it
was
de
novo.
now
it
is
restricted
under
the
amendment
that
was
made.
it
was
on
the
record
and
we
deal
in
our
brief
of
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
distinction
makes
no
difference
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
jenkins
case
and
also
i
might
say
in
the
kepner
case
of
1903
and
so
what
happens
there
is
a
new
trial.
a
new
fact
finder
and
this
time,
a
new
fact
finder
whether
it
is
with
new
evidence
which
is
what
the
statute
provides
or
the
same
evidence
or
at
least
the
tape
recording
of
the
evidence
floor
master.
that
judge
then
decides
whether
he
believes
the
child
is
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
absolutely
not.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
but
the
state
does
base
punishment
of
the
child
on
it.
that
is
the
whole
point.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
earlier
mr.
chief
justice,
the
record
indicates
that
all
the
time
children
who
are
before
a
master
and
the
master
finds
them
guilty
and
decides
that
it
holds
a
disposition
hearing
and
says
they
want
to
go
to
the
training
school,
out
the
door
they
go
to
that
training
school
that
day
and
five
days
later
or
thereafter,
but
at
least
five
days
later,
when
the
judge
signs
that
order,
that
child
is
very
much
in
the
training
school
and
i
might
say
that
if
he
is
found
not
guilty
that
child
is
very
much
at
home.
in
that
sense,
there
is
real
substantial
power
that
the
master
exercised.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is
unconstitutional
or
illegal.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
that
in
fact
happens
because
you
asked
the
question
to
mr.
nelson
earlier,
getting
at
the
point
of
what
in
fact
happens
to
that
child
between
the
time
that
the
master’s
hearing
ends
and
when
the
recommendation
goes
to
the
judge.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
in
that
interim
time
what
happens
is
that
in
fact
it
is
implemented.
if
the
master
found
the
child
guilty
and
says
he
should
go
to
a
training
school,
off
he
goes.
if
the
master
says,
“no,
i
find
you
not
guilty,”
he
goes
home.
again,
i
do
not
suggest
that
that
decides
the
ultimate
attachment
of
double
jeopardy
question,
but
certainly
it
gives
a
little
background
in
terms
of
the
reality.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
assuming
the
child
files
an
exception.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
the
child
in
that—first
of
all,
he
has
to
file
in
that
very
court
room
in
that
moment.
now,
he
could,
i
mean,
his
lawyer
could
hand
the
masterpiece
paper
and
say,
“all
right…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
at
that
point,
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
to
decide
whether
it
wished
to
request
attention
between
the
time
that
that
piece
of
paper
was
filed
and
when
the
hearing
is
held
before
the
judge.
if
the
state
wishes
to
request
attention
then
the
master
can
give
it
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
would
not
commence
serving
in
the
sense
of
the
beginning
of
a
post
conviction
sentence.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
true
although
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
essential
difference
justice
stewart
because…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
in
maryland
and
most
states
the
child,
whether
it
is
detained
or
committed
it
is
in
pursuant
to
an
indeterminate
commitment
at
least
it
is
in
maryland
and
he
goes
to
the
same
training
school
and
he
maybe
in
one
college
if
it
is
detention
and
another
college
if
it
is
commitment.
it
seems
to
me
that…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
he
cannot
say
that
for
two
reasons
one
because…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
can
take
an
exception,
but
he
cannot
say
the
first
for
two
reasons
one
because
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
recommended
period
of
commitment
because
it
is
indeterminate.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
all
right.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
the
child
can
say,
if
your
honor
please,
when
i
go
to
the
training
school,
i
want
everybody
at
the
training
school
to
know
that
i
am
there
in
detention
rather
than
commitment
and
certainly
the
order
will
say
detention
rather
than
commitment.
to
that
extent
the
child
can
make
that
allegation,
but
the
child
cannot
say
i
am
sorry.
i
do
not
want
to
go
anywhere
because
you
have
to
wait
till
the
judge
does
something.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
both
pre
and
post
trial.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
is
plucked
out
of
his
home
and
taken
to
the
detention
center
absolutely.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
nine
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
i
am
trying
to
think
of
whether
in
each
of
these
case
they
were
filed
not
guilty
and
there
was
not
any
request
by
the
state
to
detain
him
pending
as
far
as
i
can
recall
so
it
is
true
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
exactly,
now
if
i
could
just
get
into
the
law.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
he
has
found
delinquent
then
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
alright,
under
the
present
procedure
in
baltimore
city
and
it
appears
a
slight
doubt,
but
we
believe
that
the
rule
is
fairly
clear
of
the
statewide
rule
on
this.
an
exception
is
not
to
be
taken
if
the
delinquent
act
is
sustained,
there's
bifurcation
between
the
delinquent
act
which
is
the
penal
act
and
the
delinquent
child
which
is
does
he
need
care,
treatment
and
supervision.
in
maryland,
you
are
not
allowed
under
court
rule
to
take
an
exception
until
after
the
disposition
hearing.
the
disposition
hearing
may
take
place
immediately
after
the
trial.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
the
disposition
hearing
does
not
take
place
immediately
after
the
trial
then
an
exception
could
not
be
filed.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
well,
what
then
happens
depends
on
what
the
states
and
the
master’s
desire
is.
the
state
may
say
or
the
master
may
say
and
they
frequently
do
that
pending
disposition
hearing,
i
wish
the
child
to
be
in
detention
and
if
the
master
so
finds
he
is
in
detention
and
the
master
enters
an
order
and
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
at
the
beginning
of
the
disposition
or
the
trial?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
and
when
you
say
the
same
thing
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes,
if
you
mean
that
hearing
goes
on
for
more
than
a
day
or
morning,
absolutely.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
my
point
is
this,
the
significant
fact,
i
believe
is
that
the
master
conducts
what
is
conceded
to
be
under
maryland
law
and
what
has
been
found
to
be
by
two
federal
district
courts,
i
might
say,
a
full
trial
then
the
child
is
found
guilty
or
the
master
says
you
are
guilty
or
not
guilty
as
the
case
maybe.
now,
the
question
is
this,
has
he
been
in
jeopardy
during
that
period
when
he
is
before
that
master?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
again,
we
get
involved
in…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
again
we
get
involved
in
the
terminology
problem.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
does,
he
just
does
not
sign
the
order.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
the
master
until
1975
--.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
by
signing
an
order,
no,
he
may
not
sign
the
order.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
does
it
by
stating
that
he
is
going
to
do
it
and
if
perfunctorily
really
approved
by
the
judge.
now,
i
know
that
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
case,
let
me
be
very
frank
with
you.
i
do
not
want
to
predict
my
own
doom
here.
but
there
have
been
15
judges
who
have
heard
this
case
so
far,
five
trial
judges
and
10
appellate
judges,
and
all
the
appellate
judges
have
ruled
against
us
and
all
the
trial
judges
have
ruled
in
our
favor
including
the
initial
juvenile
court
trial
judge
and
i
think
i
may
have
an
idea
as
to
why
that
has
happened
because
it
takes
a
little
bit
of
time
to
live
with
this
case
and
realize
the
difference
between
whatever
may
have
been
the
conceptions
at
one
time
or
whatever
may
now
be
the
conceptions
of
a
master
in
chancery
and
a
master
in
civil
areas
versus
what
is
happening
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
he
sat
as
a
trial
judge
though
in
this
case.
i
was
referring
to
judge
in
his
capacity
as
trial
judge
for
that
moment.
now,
when
you
look
at
all
the
facts
in
this
case,
you
eventually,
i
believe
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
however
you
dress
it
up,
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
a
child
in
a
big
urban
court
system
such
as
baltimore
with
one
judge
and
seven
masters,
where
the
masters
hear
90
percent
of
the
cases,
they
are
tried
in
front
of
masters
for
the
most
part
and
there
are
full
and
complete
trials.
now,
there
are
only
two
questions
that
then
have
to
be
asked
legally
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
offends
a
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
not
if
there
was
a
full
trial
in
front
of
a
master,
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
said
full
trial
before
the
master.
in
other
words,
in
my
view,
if
there
was
full
trial
before
the
master
that
does
not
change
the
result
that
if
it
then
goes
before
later
on
that
it
is
not
double
jeopardy.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
of
course,
if
there
are
exceptions
mr.
chief
justice,
let
us
say
there
is
an
exception
by
the
child
normally
that
is
going
to
be
a
de
novo
hearing.
it
can
be
on
the
record,
but
normally
the
child
will
request
a
de
novo
hearing,
but
that
takes
it
wholly
outside
of
the
framework
of
this
case
because
it
is
like
the
united
states
where,
though
the
child
did
not
like
what
he
got
and
he
sought
a
new
trial.
if
it
is
the
other
way
around
then
of
course
we
are
right
back
in
our
case,
that
the
state
takes
an
exception.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
now
the
record
shows
that
the
judge
spends
an
average
of
less
than
one
minute
on
each
order
and
most
of
whatever
is
spent
in
review
actually
is
connection
with
disposition
memos
because
those
are
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
gets
disposition
memos,
but
my
answer
is
no.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
in
a
way
i
can
get
strangled
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
one
assumes
that
my
answer
to
your
question
was
the
other
way
around,
that
is
that
it
really
depends
on
how
much
time
the
master
or
judge
spends
with
the
master’s
findings.
we
did
not
put
the
facts
in
the
case
or
hopes
so
that
i
will
get
strangled
with
them.
we
put
the
facts
in
the
case
so
that
this
court
would
have
a
good
idea
of
what
in
fact
goes
on
in
the
juvenile
system
in
a
big
city
and
what
in
fact
this
role
of
a
master
is
so
that
this
court
would
realize
that
the
master
simply
is
not
some
judge's
employee
anymore.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
would
not
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
whether
the
judge
can
retry
him
if
it
were
99
percent.
our
legal
conception
would
not
be
any
different.
i
think
that
it
certainly
makes
our
case
factually
much
more
appealing
that
99.99
percent
are
perfunctorily
signed
off,
but
i
do
to
think
as
a
matter
of
theory
it
makes
any
difference.
now
if
i
could
turn
just
for
a
moment.
--.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
this
1983
suite
was
brought
your
honor
because
nine
juveniles
were
found
not
guilty.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
99.9
percent
of
all
matters
that
are
tried
in
front
of
the
master
the
judge
agrees
with
him.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
by
all
means.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
the
facts
in
the
record
which
indicate
the
relationship
between
the
master
and
the
judge
in
terms
of
the
number
cases,
the
master
hears
and
what
actually
happens
to
those
cases
and
the
role
the
judge
plays
is
not
wholly
irrelevant,
in
terms
of
basically
understanding
where
the
system
work
which
is
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
the
great
bulk
of
the
case
is.
now
if
i
could
turn
to
the
law
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
from
reading
the
opinions
of
this
court,
my
impression
is
that
the
court
does
not
in
fact
rubber
stamp
it,
but
i
think
it
is
a
different
question
mr.
chief
justice
because
we
are
dealing
with
proceedings
that
under
gault
and
winship
and
breed,
clearly
come
under
a
number
of
procedural
protections
to
the
bill
of
rights
and
then
that
is
why
i
think
we
are
here.
if
i
might
for
just
a
minute
turn
to
the
law
in
our
case,
we
are
making
two
points.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
first
jeopardy
that
attaches
and
that
it
attaches
at
the
commencement
of
the
master’s
hearing.
now
i
submit
and
it
is
elaborated
in
our
brief
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
v.
breed
explicitly
so
holds,
it
was
the
master
in
jones
v.
breed,
jeopardy
attached
at
the
start
and
it
is
simply
not
true
as
the
state
pointed
out
that
in
california,
the
master
or
the
referee
as
they
call
him
there
has
the
power
to
sign
an
order
when
a
child
is
committed.
he
does
not
have
the
power
at
all,
when
a
child
is
taken
out
of
the
home
that
must
be
affirmatively
signed
by
the
judge.
therefore,
in
our
view
jones
v.
breed
squarely
decides
the
first
issue
that
the
state
has
raised
here.
remember
the
state
has
got
two
arguments,
the
first
is
that
jeopardy
never
attaches
at
all
and
therefore
there
cannot
be
a
second
one.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
now
i
might
say
that
that
represents
what
the
state
said
in
its
argument,
it
represents
a
change
from
what
it
says
in
its
brief.
its
brief
does
not
say
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
file
from
the
master
goes
to
the
judge.
rather
it
says
that
jeopardy
can
never
attach
until
on
an
exception
hearing,
the
judge
begins
to
hear
the
case
de
novo.
which
either
one
we
suggest
it
is
not
proper
and
in
our
view,
breed
v.
jones
simply
decides
that
first
question.
jeopardy
does
attach
at
the
beginning
of
the
fact
finder’s
hearing.
that
is
the
term
that
has
always
been
used.
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
breed
v.
jones
talked
in
terms
of
the
risk
of
punishment
and
surely
when
that
child
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
with
all
respect,
the
question
cannot
simply
be
answered
like
that?
mr.
peter
s.
smith
let
me
stick
with
it.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
by
punish,
you
mean
that
child
going
off
to
a
training
school…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
precisely.
in
our
case.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
i
can
continue
for
just
a
moment,
as
i
believe
i
am
correct
that
this
court
in
breed
v.
jones
settles
the
question
that
because
there
is
a
risk
of
conviction,
not
conviction
and
punishment
but
a
risk
at
the
start
of
the
master’s
proceeding
that
jeopardy
does
attach,
that
only
leave
one
other
question
and
question
is
whether
a
second
jeopardy
attaches
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
when
the
matter
goes
before
the
judge.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
i
agree
that
that
would
not
be
double
jeopardy
at
all.
it
does
not
involve
jeopardy.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
i
think
we
have
more
than
that.
we
had
a
trial.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
alright
if
you
draw
the
analogy
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
controls
the
first
half
of
the
case,
it
does
not
control
the
second
half,
which
is
where
i
would
like
to
spend
the
next
couple
of
minutes.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
if
a
master,
as
is
generally
not
used
in
the
outlying
smaller
jurisdictions
but
if
they
were
--
mr.
peter
s.
smith
yes,
they
are
used
in
all
of
the
major
metropolitan
counties
except
for
montgomery
county
although
they
are
being
phased
out
this
july
in
prince
georgia
but
they
tend
to
be…
mr.
peter
s.
smith
that
is
correct
although,
i
might
say
that
the
parties
in
this
case
involve
--
plaintiffs
in
baltimore
city
and
defendant
state’s
attorney
from
baltimore
city.
the
second
half
and
the
reason
what
admittedly
is
not
covered
in
terms
by
jones
v.
breed
is
whether
there
is
a
second
jeopardy
that
attaches
when
the
case
goes
before
the
judge
and
we
think
that
there
is
for
two
different
--
alternatively
for
two
reasons,
either
because
the
hearing
before
the
master,
despite
the
fact
that
he
has
not
signed
his
name
is
sufficiently
final
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
when
you
consider
that
it
was
a
trial,
when
you
consider
what
double
jeopardy
is
all
about
and
when
you
consider
the
realities
of
the
system,
in
which
case
of
course,
it
would
be
a
second
jeopardy.
if
it
is
not
final,
surely,
there
is
only
one
alternative
and
that
is
that
it
is
not
final.
if
it
is
not
final,
we
suggest
that
it
nonetheless
is
a
double
jeopardy
because
how
does
it
come
to
be
a
second
trial
before
the
judge.
it
comes
to
be
there
because
the
state
prevents
the
matter
from
going
to
its
logical
conclusion,
which
as
we
all
know
is
going
to
be
the
stroke
of
a
pen
and
indeed
was
in
several
of
these
cases,
the
judge
mistakenly
signed
the
order
early
of
acquittal.
instead
because
the
state’s
attorney
says
no,
i
want
another
crack,
that
does
not
happen.
what
happens
instead
is
a
new
trial
before
the
judge.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
de
novo
or
on
the
record.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
at
least
five
days
has
to
go
by,
mr.
justice
stevens
because
that
is
the
time
that
the
party
has
to
decided
whether
he
wants
to
take
an
exception
and
normally
it
would
be
immediately
thereafter
if
as
is
virtually
always
the
case
written
findings
and
conclusions
are
waived,
so
normally
the
answer
would
be
five
days.
when
it
goes
before
the
judge
at
the
second
trial,
whether
it
be
on
the
record
or
de
novo,
in
our
view,
that
could
only
be
justified
by
an
exception
to
the
normal
double
jeopardy
rule.
obviously,
the
ball
exception
has
no
application
here
and
nor
does
the
barkus
exception
so
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
perez,
denits(ph)
exception.
denits(ph)
does
not
have
any
application
either
really
so
it
is
the
perez
exception.
our
position
is
that
this
does
not
represent
manifest
necessity
to
prevent
the
trial
from
going
to
its
conclusion
because
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
the
state’s
attorney
prevented
it.
why?
because
he
did
not
like
the
result.
the
master
believed
the
child
was
not
guilty
and
he
wants
to
goad
again
before
judge.
mr.
peter
s.
smith
it
is
part
of
our
argument
but
if
i
can
just
have
30
seconds
to
conclude
this
point,
if
jeopardy
did
attach
the
first
time,
there
has
got
to
be
some
reason
for
concluding
that
there
is
an
exception
to
saying
that
it
did
not
attach
a
second
time.
the
continuing
jeopardy
doctrine,
of
course,
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
consistently
right
up
to
the
present
and
the
only
way
that
we
can
see
that
you
can
say
that
a
second
jeopardy
does
not
attach
is
to
claim
that
its
manifest
necessity
and
yet
the
very
heart
of
this
court’s
manifest
necessity
decisions
is
that
for
the
state’s
attorney
to
say,
i
am
not
satisfied
with
the
result
is
not
manifest
necessity.
thank
you.
