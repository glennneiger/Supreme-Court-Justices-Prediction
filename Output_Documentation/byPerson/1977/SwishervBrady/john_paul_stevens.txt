justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
general
nilson,
is
it
your
view
that
the
state
could
complete
its
presentation
of
evidence
before
the
master
and
lose
and
then
instead
of
finding
exceptions,
you
will
say,
i
think
we
will
start
over
and
get
some
more
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
master
make
a
recommendation
of
no
finding
of
delinquency
and
then
instead
of
taking
exceptions,
i
take
it
your
view
is
the
state
could
say
well
let
us
go
back
and
get
some
more
witnesses
and
have
another
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
we
get
to
that
because
i
still
am
a
little
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier,
if
there
is
a
finding
of
delinquency
and
if
the
child
files
exception
is
there
automatic
taking
him
into
custody
or
does
the
state
have
to
request
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
makes
--
promptly
file
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
disposition
hearing
does
not
take
place
immediately,
he
will
not
be
taken
to
a
home
right
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
not
also
go
onto
a
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
the
prosecutor
say
precisely
the
same
thing
at
the
beginning
in
the
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
beginning
of
the
whole
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
the
prosecutor
by
the
same
procedure
and
cause
the
child
to
be
detained
during
the
hearing
as
well
as
immediately
after
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
but
then
really
what
is
the
greater
--
you
were
expressing
the
significance
of
the
masters
finding
a
delinquency.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
is
the
scene
if
that
is
necessarily
controlling
in
the
case
where
exceptions
are
taken.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
99
percent
figure
includes
those
which
has
exceptions
at
all
by
either
side
and
which
is
95
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
the
new
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
what
is
the
normal
time
interval
between
the
masterâ€™s
conclusion
of
proceedings
for
the
master
and
the
entry
of
the
order
by
the
judge?
