mr.
george
a.
nilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
seeking
reversal
of
the
opinion
of
the
three
judge
federal
court
below
which
held
that
maryland’s
juvenile
justice
system
of
delinquency
hearings
before
masters
with
review
available
from
the
juvenile
court
judge
by
way
of
exception
offends
the
constitutional
bar
against
double
jeopardy.
under
maryland’s
present
statutes
and
rules
governing
juvenile
court
proceedings,
most
of
the
more
populous
local
jurisdictions
in
maryland
as
well
as
some
of
the
rural
counties
employ
masters
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
various
hearings
within
the
juvenile
court
system.
the
utilization
of
these
masters
which
also
characterizes
the
juvenile
justice
systems
of
approximately
34
other
states
is
designed
both
to
assist
the
circuit
court
system
in
dealing
with
the
extremely
heavy
caseload
in
the
juvenile
area
and
also
to
provide
for
the
involvement
in
the
process
of
persons
who
by
virtue
of
their
interests,
expertise
and
permanent
assignment
to
the
juvenile
court
system
can
bring
to
bear
in
the
disposition
of
juvenile
clauses
a
familiarity
with
and
sensitivity
to
the
special
needs
and
problems
of
juveniles
charged
with
committing
acts
in
violation
of
the
state’s
criminal
laws.
under
maryland’s
system,
the
juvenile
court
judge
hears
originally
all
petitions
for
waiver
of
jurisdiction
to
the
criminal
courts
for
trial
as
adults
and
also
generally
hears
originally
the
more
aggravated
charges
such
as
murder,
rape
or
armed
robbery
as
well
as
cases
where
exceptions
to
a
master’s
proposal
are
anticipated
in
advance
of
the
proceedings.
with
certain
other
limited
exceptions,
other
delinquency
cases
including
arraignment,
detention,
adjudication
and
disposition,
maybe
assigned
for
the
hearing
of
evidence
to
one
of
the
full
time
masters
employed
by
the
court.
under
both
the
statute
and
under
maryland
rule
911,
when
a
master
conducts
an
adjudicatory
and
a
disposition
hearing,
he
is
required
to
transmit
his
proposed
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law
and
recommendations
and
proposed
disposition
orders
to
the
juvenile
court
judge
within
10
days
of
the
conclusion
of
the
disposition
hearing.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
in
baltimore
city,
there
is
one
judge
and
seven
masters.
that
is
correct.
in
the
other
counties,
the
ratio,
more
closely
approximates
one
to
one.
the
figures
both
as
to
judges
and
masters
i
think
are
given
in
our
brief.
both
the
statute
and
the
rule
provide
that
these
proposed
findings,
conclusions
and
recommendations
do
not
constitute
orders
or
final
action
of
the
court
and
that
final
adjudication
and
disposition
orders
are
only
entered
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
following
his
consideration
of
any
exceptions
which
may
be
filed
within
five
days
or
if
no
exceptions
are
filed,
following
his
concurrence
in
the
master’s
recommendations
if
he
agrees
with
them.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
he
could
not.
there
would
be
no
order
of
the
court
on
the
basis
of
which
the
state
could
act.
there
would
have
been
no
disposition
of
that
case,
if
there
had
been
no
transmittal
of
the
findings
and
no
order
entered.
the
only
officer
in
the
court
system
with
the
power
to
enter
an
order,
disposing
of
the
case
and
providing
for
a
disposition
of
that
juvenile
is
the
judge.
now,
in
terms
of
the
submission
of
recommendations
and
findings
while
as
i
have
just
indicated
the
rule
and
the
statute
do
require
that
those
recommendations
and
the
findings
of
fact
be
transmitted
to
the
judge,
that
is
frequently
waived
by
the
parties
and
this
is
pointed
out
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
appellee’s
brief.
that
occurs
in
situations
where
the
parties
essentially
are
acquiescing
in
the
master’s
proposed
disposition
of
the
case
which
he
announces
at
the
hearing
and
they
will
say
to
the
master
--
pardon
me.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
while
understandably
a
few
recommendations
are
disturbed
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
in
the
absence
of
exceptions
by
either
the
state
or
the
juvenile,
the
judge
does
have
the
authority
sue
sponte
to
either
remands
the
master
for
further
hearing
to
himself
hold
a
further
non-evidentiary
hearing
or
to
himself
hold
a
supplemental
evidentiary
hearing
if
both
the
state
and
the
juvenile
agree
to
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
this
case
focuses
on
the
double
jeopardy
implications
of
the
review
of
the
master’s
recommendation
upon
the
filing
of
exceptions
thereto
by
the
state.
appellees
argue
that
regardless
of
the
basis
for
the
exceptions,
and
regardless
of
whether
additional
evidence
is
heard
by
the
judge
with
a
consent
of
all
parties
including
the
juvenile
or
whether
the
judge's
review
is
solely
on
the
record,
the
juvenile
is
placed
in
jeopardy
at
the
evidentiary,
adjudicatory
hearing
before
the
master
that,
that
jeopardy
concludes
upon
the
filing
of
the
master’s
recommendations
and
that
any
consideration
given
by
way
of
review
of
the
juvenile
court
judge
upon
the
filing
with
exception
by
the
state
to
a
master’s
recommendation
of
a
non-delinquency
finding,
constitutes
a
new
and
impermissible
second
jeopardy.
obviously,
the
state
disagrees
with
all
of
the
elements
of
that
position
taken
by
the
appellees.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
in
a
situation
where
a
master
has
adjudicated
that
the
child
committed
an
act
and
is
proposing
detention
of
the
child
for
example,
there
maybe
certain
consequences
with
respect
to
a
temporary
continuation
of
the
detention
that
is
already
in
place
pending
the
disposition
of
the
matter
but
no
separate
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no
final
disposition
whatsoever
can
flow
from
that
recommendation
of
the
master.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
think,
in
the
majority
of
cases,
they
are
not
but
i
am
not
certain
i
could
generalize
on
that.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
different
judges
involved.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
specially
assigned
juvenile
judge.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
all
master’s
reports
go
to
a
single
judge,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
i
think,
judge
hammerman
was
the
juvenile
judge
in
baltimore
city
for
some
eight
years
and
then
judge
karwacki
and
there
is
evidence
from
both
of
those
two
judges
in
the
record.
the
appellee’s
initial
attack
on
the
maryland
system
culminated
in
the
decision
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
matter
of
anderson
in
1974,
because
there
are
several
prior
proceedings
in
this
case
relevant,
i
thought
it
best
to
just
describe
them
briefly
to
the
court.
in
that
case,
certain
juveniles
challenged
the
provisions
of
what
was
then
maryland
rule
908
and
is
now
911,
which
will
authorize
the
state
to
file
exceptions
to
a
master’s
recommendation
of
non-delinquency
contending
there
that
the
provision
for
a
de
novo
hearing
before
the
juvenile
court
judge
violated
applicable
double
jeopardy
principles.
at
that
time
the
rules
did
permit
a
de
novo
hearing
upon
exception
by
the
state.
assuming
in
correct
anticipation
of
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
breed
v.
jones
the
double
jeopardy
principles
apply
to
adjudications
of
delinquency
in
juvenile
court.
maryland’s
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
challenge
to
the
rule
permitting
exceptions
by
the
state
on
the
grounds
that
the
juvenile
master
is
a
ministerial
and
not
a
judicial
officer
that
under
the
maryland
constitution
he
is
entrusted
with
no
part
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
state,
that
his
recommendations
are
only
that
and
do
not
become
binding
unless
and
until
approved
by
the
judge
and
that
accordingly,
the
hearing
before
the
master
is
not
such
a
hearing
that
places
a
juvenile
in
jeopardy
at
the
time
that
hearing
occurs.
following
that
decision,
review
of
which
was
denied
by
this
court
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question,
the
appellees
file
this
case
and
a
companion
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
us
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
the
habeas
cases
were
heard
and
decided
first
resulting
in
an
opinion
in
june
of
1975
in
aldridge
v.
dean
concluding
that
the
ability
of
the
state
to
file
exceptions
to
the
master’s
finding
and
to
obtain
a
de
novo
adjudicatory
hearing
before
a
judge
again
under
the
former
version
of
the
maryland
rule,
violated
the
rights
of
juveniles
not
to
be
twice
placed
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
immediately
following
the
decision
of
the
habeas
cases,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
adopted
amended
juvenile
court
rules
which
explicitly
confirmed
the
holding
in
matter
of
anderson
that
the
master’s
recommendations
are
proposed
only
and
are
not
binding
or
final
orders
of
the
court.
the
new
rules
also
denied
to
the
state
when
it
takes
exception
to
the
master’s
recommendation,
the
opportunity
to
adduce
any
new
evidence
before
the
juvenile
court
judge
without
the
consent
of
the
juvenile.
moreover
the
juvenile
court
statute
effective
july
1,
’75
required
for
the
first
time
that
proceedings
before
the
masters
be
recorded,
thus
making
possible
meaningful
review
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
on
the
record
developed
before
the
master.
appellees
then
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
in
this
case
alleging
the
violation
of
double
jeopardy
not
withstanding
the
changes
in
the
rules,
additional
evidence
was
introduced
and
the
opinion
below
followed
in
september
of
’77.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
there
is
nothing
further
within
a
state
court
system
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
state
can
file
exceptions
with
the
juvenile
court
judge,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
right,
the
state
could
not
then
take
that
juvenile
for
example
and
do
what
was
done
in
breed
v.
jones
which
is
to
attempt
to
try
them
in
the
ad-hoc
court,
or
anywhere
nor
do
i
think
they
could
go
up
and
attempt
to
seek
reversal
and
bring
it
back
down
for
retrial
or
reconsideration
back
in
the
juvenile
court
system.
but
what
we
have
got
here
is
confined
entirely
within
the
juvenile
court
system
at
the
lower
court
level
and
we
would
submit
essentially
is
one
continuous
proceeding.
there
are
two
parts
to
the
state’s
argument
on
the
double
jeopardy
point.
the
first
is
that
essentially,
jeopardy
does
not
attach
at
the
hearing
before
the
master
and
the
basis
for
that
is
that
he
is
not
the
trier
of
fact
with
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
or
acquittal
or
the
equivalent
thereof.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
jeopardy
would
attach
at
the
moment
that
that
case
filed,
that
the
record
in
the
case,
that
the
evidence,
that
the
recommendations
of
the
master
are
given
to
the
juvenile
court
judge.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
once
that
is
before
the
judge,
then
essentially
evidence
is
before
the
trier
of
fact,
that
officer
who
has
authority
to
enter
an
order
of
guilt
or
innocence
or
delinquency
or
non-delinquency
in
a
case.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
when
you
say
lose
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
i
suppose
theoretically
possible
under
the
port
of
argument
that
says
jeopardy
is
a
not
attached
until
it
gets
to
the
judge,
that
is
correct
and
i
think
the
only
way
to
respond
to
that
in
terms
of
suggesting
that
that
might
not
be
permissible
is
that
there
you
would
have
the
state
interrupting
a
continuous
process
which
is
established
and
then
that
continuous
process
moves
from
the
master
to
the
judge.
the
state
on
its
own
initiative
and
working
against
that
continuous
process
would
be
interrupting
it
and
taking
it
back
and
starting
over
again.
i
can
see
even
under
the
first
theory
that
argument
being
made
to
the
effect
that
that
would
constitute
subjecting
in
to
double
jeopardy.
under
the
state's
second
theory
of
the
case,
then
i
think
clearly
that
would
constitute
double
jeopardy
because
he
would
not
longer
be
within
the
continuous
process.
he
would
have
interrupted
the
continuous
process
and
the
second
part
of
our
argument
essentially
begins
with
an
assumption
that
contrary
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
this
court
holds
that
jeopardy
begins
to
attach
at
the
hearing
before
the
master.
then
the
state’s
position
is
that
it
is
a
single
jeopardy
as
long
as
you
stay
within
that
continuous
process
on
through
the
stage
of
the
case
where
the
judge
enters
the
order
but
that
if
you
interrupt
that
continuum
then
you
would
be
violating
double
jeopardy
under
the
state's
second
--
.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
at
what
stage,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
george
a.
nilson
typically,
he
would
not
be
brought
before
but
if
he
was
brought
before
the
judge
for
an
adjudicatory
hearing
directly,
yes,
but
typically
that
does
not
happen.
typically,
the
juvenile
does
not
come
into
contact
with
the
judge
at
a
hearing
until
the
final
stage,
except
in
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
earlier
which
is
a
waiver
hearing
where
the
issue
is
whether
jurisdiction
should
be
laid
with
the
criminal
court,
whether
it
is
an
aggravated
offense
or
it
is
a
situation
where
they
anticipate
in
advance
that
exceptions
would
be
taken
to
a
finding
of
the
master
but
otherwise
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
generally
speaking,
he
never
appears
before
the
judge.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
it
is
the
master
who
presides
over
the
taking
of
evidence
and
that
would
involve
testimony
put
on
by
the
state’s
attorney
and
testimony
put
on
by
the
juvenile
which
might
include
testimony
by
the
juvenile.
thirdly,
and
i
think
the
third
argument
of
the
state
really
relates
to
the
first
two
is
that
even
if
a
system
such
as
that
embodied
in
maryland’s
juvenile
court
statutes
and
rules,
would
be
viewed
as
violative
of
double
jeopardy
if
applied
to
trials
in
the
criminal
courts,
special
consideration
of
the
need
for
some
informality,
flexibility
and
experimentation
in
the
juvenile
justice
setting
should
lead
to
a
conclusion
that
the
entertainment
by
a
judge
at
exceptions
filed
by
the
state
as
we
have
here
does
not
violate
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
and
is
not
contrary
to
double
jeopardy
prescription
in
the
special
context
of
juvenile
court
proceedings.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
still
done
to
a
considerable
extent,
there
is
a
very
elaborate
what
we
call
an
intake
process.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
suspect
that
there
was
a
time
when
that
happened.
masters
have
not
been
employed
forever
in
maryland.
i
think
they
date
back
to
the
middle
’40.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
employment
of
intake
officers
in
these
mode,
it
is
common
in
many
states
and
as
i
said
it
is
used
frequently
in
maryland
and
there
are
many
cases
that
are
disposed
off
by
these
intake
officers
who
are
not
lawyers,
not
masters,
not
judges
before
the
case
ever
gets
up
to
even
the
master
stage
or
the
judge
stage.
a
very
large
percentage
of
today’s
high
volume
of
juvenile
matters
are
disposed
off
through
that
intake
process
and
thus
never
get
before
for
any
kind
of
an
adjudicatory
hearing
before
a
master
or
a
judge.
the
state’s
first
argument
on
the
question
of
when
jeopardy
attaches
is
both
set
forth
in
the
first
part
of
our
brief
and
is
reflected
as
i
indicated
before
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decision
in
matter
of
anderson.
it
represents
the
approach
adopted
by
several
other
state
courts
which
have
considered
this
issue.
rather
than
attempt
to
fully
restate
that
portion
of
our
argument,
i
would
like
to
simply
focus
on
the
implications
of
this
court’s
decision
in
breed
v.
jones
relative
to
that
particular
argument
and
this
particular
case.
the
holding
in
breed
was
of
course
limited
to
the
proposition
that
once
a
juvenile
court
finds
that
a
juvenile
has
committed
acts
that
violated
criminal
law,
the
juvenile
has
been
put
in
jeopardy
and
cannot
thereafter
be
waived
to
the
adult
criminal
court
system
for
trial
because
such
a
criminal
trial
would
constitute
a
second
and
impermissible
jeopardy.
in
its
opinion
in
breed,
this
court
made
no
distinction
between
the
respective
roles
of
juvenile
court
referee
and
juvenile
court
judge
in
the
california
proceedings
there
at
issue
but
referred
throughout
to
the
actions
of
the
juvenile
court.
under
the
california
system,
dispositions
proposed
by
referees
do
not
require
the
affirmative
concurrence
of
the
juvenile
court
judge
but
become
final
upon
the
failure
of
the
judge
to
disturb
them
within
20
days
following
the
hearing
before
the
referee.
this
court
did
not
consider
or
discuss
in
breed,
the
relative
roles
of
the
referee
and
the
judge
since
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
do
so.
appellees
have
correctly
pointed
out
in
their
brief
that
an
examination
of
the
record
in
breed
indicates
that
the
adjudicatory
hearing
which
occurred
in
that
case
was
in
fact
held
before
a
referee
rather
than
a
judge
and
from
this,
they
have
argued
that
the
clear
implication,
if
not
the
expressed
holding
of
breed
is
that
jeopardy
attached
in
that
case
at
the
moment
evidence
was
first
presented
to
the
california
juvenile
court
referee.
while
this
court
could
so
conclude,
if
and
when
expressly
presented
with
a
question,
we
submit
that
the
question
was
not
presented
or
decided
in
breed.
in
essence,
it
is
our
position
that
the
question
of
when
jeopardy
attaches
in
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
should
be
answered
as
i
indicated
earlier
by
holding
that
it
attaches
when
evidence
is
first
presented
to
that
officer
of
the
court
who
has
the
authority
to
decide
factual
questions
and
to
dispose
off
the
case
by
a
finding
of
delinquency
or
non-delinquency.
whatever
the
precise
point
in
time
at
which
jeopardy
attaches
in
the
california
system
might
be,
we
submit
that
the
point
in
time
at
which
jeopardy
attaches
in
maryland
is
when
the
recommendations
of
the
master
are
presented
to
and
considered
by
the
juvenile
court
judge.
the
fact
that
the
master
is
previously
presided
of
evidentiary
hearing
and
formulated
his
own
proposed
findings
should
not
have
to
be
held
to
have
accelerated
the
point
in
time
at
which
jeopardy
attaches.
surely,
the
mere
fact
that
evidence
is
presented
before
the
master
should
not
result
in
a
holding
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
that
occurs.
what
is
critical
is
the
presentation
of
evidence
to
the
trier
of
fact.
the
second
part
of
the
argument
as
i
indicated
before
is
premised
on
an
assumption
that
the
court
should
hold
that
jeopardy
did
begin
to
attach
at
that
first
hearing
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
the
limited
review
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
of
the
master’s
recommendation
upon
the
filing
an
exception
at
that
point
does
not
constitute
a
second
and
impermissible
jeopardy.
when
that
exception
has
been
filed,
there
has
been
at
that
point
in
time
no
adjudication
of
acquittal
or
its
equivalent
such
as
would
constitute
a
termination
of
the
initial
jeopardy.
regardless
of
the
subjective
perception
and
sense
of
relief
that
the
juvenile
upon
hearing
the
master’s
proposed
or
recommended
disposition
of
the
case
in
his
favor
may
have,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
master’s
recommendation
is
nothing
more
than
advisory
of
the
court
and
is
not
final
unless
and
until
approved
by
the
juvenile
court
judge.
the
correctness
of
that
assertion
is
not
altered
in
the
least
by
the
fact
that
master’s
recommendations
are
generally
adopted
by
the
judge
in
the
absence
of
exceptions
by
the
parties.
appellees
in
their
brief
have
made
a
great
deal
out
of
the
fact
that
the
judges
approve
the
vast
majority
of
master’s
recommendations
that
are
presented
before
them
and
move
from
that
to
argue
that
the
judges
are
a
mere
rubber
stamp.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it
is
terribly
important
for
this
court
to
understand
several
things
about
the
facts
that
the
appellees
have
brought
to
bear
in
dealing
with
that.
number
one,
they
are
talking
about
situations
where
no
exceptions
are
filed
to
the
master’s
recommendations.
therefore,
it
is
natural
that
the
judge
would
be
inclined
to
accept
and
approve
most
of
those
recommendations.
also,
in
the
bulk
of
those
cases,
both
parties
have
even
waived
the
requirement
that
the
master
prepared
detailed
written
findings
to
submit
to
the
judge.
i
think
it
also
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
figures
and
the
information
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
time
spent
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
in
reviewing
master’s
recommendations
predate
the
current
rules.
the
testimony
of
judge
karwacki
which
is
included
in
the
appendix
filed
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
judges
do
do
a
conscientious
style
of
reviewing
those
cases
that
are
presented
to
the
judges
with
written
recommendations
from
the
masters
and
do
on
occasion
listen
to
the
recordings
which
are
now
made
of
the
testimony
and
the
proceedings
before
the
master.
maryland
rules
provide
that
prior
to
the
time
that
the
judge
enters
an
order
either
the
state
or
the
juvenile
may
note
an
exemption
to
the
master’s
recommendation
and
have
the
matter
considered
by
the
judge
before
a
final
disposition
of
the
case.
when
a
juvenile
notes
an
exception,
the
rule
provides
that
he
may
elect
either
a
hearing
de
novo
or
a
hearing
before
the
judge
on
the
record
established
before
the
master.
when
the
state
notes
an
exception,
the
controlling
rule
now
assures
to
the
juvenile
his
right
to
insist
if
he
wishes
that
the
judge
consider
the
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
record
which
was
made
before
the
master
and
which
caused
the
master
to
recommend
in
his
favor.
alternatively,
additional
evidence
may
be
presented
to
the
judge
but
only
if
he
considers
it
relevant,
and
if
both
the
state
and
the
juvenile
consent
to
its
introduction.
thus,
the
juvenile
is
able
to
prevent
the
state
from
presenting
evidence
which
it
did
not
present
before
the
master
or
from
retrying
its
case
again
before
the
judge.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
are
separate
proceedings
before
different
tribunals.
each
of
which
can
result
in
an
adjudication
for
or
against
the
juvenile.
there
is
only
one
proceeding
before
the
juvenile
court
which
consists
of
the
presentation
of
evidence
before
and
the
issue
of
recommendations
to
the
court
by
the
master.
the
final
determination
of
the
matter
on
behalf
of
the
juvenile
court
by
the
judge
either
following
his
consideration
of
any
exceptions
filed
or
following
his
concurrence
in
the
recommendation
of
the
master
in
the
absence
of
exceptions,
if
he
chooses
to
concur.
the
state's
contention
that
the
proceedings
in
maryland
juvenile
courts
are
continuous
in
nature
and
involve
only
a
single
jeopardy,
does
not
require
this
court
to
now
adopt
the
type
of
continuing
jeopardy
theory
articulated
first
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
kepner
v.
united
states.
holmes
in
continuing
jeopardy
view
clearly
involves
situations
where
the
criminal
justice
process
is
punctuated
by
adjudications
of
innocent
or
guilt
and
thereafter
proceeds
to
a
contrary
determination
or
a
subsequent
trial
with
the
potential
for
producing
another
adjudication.
here,
the
process
is
not
so
punctuated
because
the
maryland
rules
provide
that
the
first
and
only
adjudication
cannot
and
does
not
occur
until
after
the
completion
of
the
entire
process
when
the
juvenile
court
judge
enters
an
appropriate
order.
when
the
judge
entertains
an
exception
filed
by
the
state
to
the
master’s
recommendation,
he
does
so
not
in
the
context
of
a
separate
and
distinct
proceeding
but
as
the
final
stage
in
a
single
continuous
proceeding.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
the
only
situation
under
which
a
remand
to
the
master
is
provided
for
is
where
the
judge
disagrees
with
the
master’s
recommendation
on
his
own
initiative.
remand
is
not
provided
for
in
the
situation
where
the
matter
goes
to
the
judge
on
exception.
that
particular
maryland
rule
only
provides
for
a
hearing
before
the
judge.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
what
the
rule
contemplates
and
it
is
voted
up
or
down
on
the
basis
of
a
non-evidentiary
hearing
when
the
state
is
the
accepting
party.
non-evidentiary
hearing
unless
the
juvenile
and
the
state
both
consent
to
the
introduction
of
additional
evidence.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
there
is
no
sending
back
for
another
trial
before
the
master
at
that
point,
the
state
has
used
up
what
i
would
submit
as
the
one
card
that
it
had
available
to
it
in
the
first
place.
that
is
that
single
continuous
proceeding.
to
hold
that
breed
v.
jones
must
be
extended
so
as
to
bar
the
state
from
completing
the
process
would
represent,
we
submit
an
unwarranted
extension
of
double
jeopardy
principles
within
the
juvenile
justice
system
and
unless
there
are
further
question
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
briefly
if
i
may
use
the
few
minutes
to
clarify
several
factual
points.
in
the
colloquy
with
mr.
smith
the
question
came
up
earlier
on
in
his
argument
about
what
is
said
and
how
it
is
said
by
the
master
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
i
would
agree
with
some
of
the
comments
which
indicated
that
that
does
not
or
may
not
have
a
terribly
significant
bearing
on
the
legal
outcome
but
i
think
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
in
many
cases,
the
master
specifically
advises
the
juvenile
that
the
state
does
have
the
opportunity
to
take
exception
even
where
the
master
does
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
he
may
be
overstating.
he
does
not
have
the
authority.
in
fact,
whatever
he
says
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
be
laboring
under
the
impression
that
in
all
cases,
he
overstates
his
authority
because
that
is
not
true.
the
record
indicates
that
in
many
instances,
the
juveniles
are
specifically
informed
by
the
master
that
the
state
has
the
ability
to
take
exceptions
to
the
master’s
proposals
and
when
they
are
not
told
by
the
master,
they
are
told
by
their
own
counsel
because
all
of
the
juveniles
at
these
hearings
are
represented
by
counsel
by
and
large
by
the
pubic
defenders
office.
the
subject
of
detention
came
up
and
the
question
of
what
action
the
master
could
take
with
respect
to
detention
at
the
time
the
adjudicatory
hearing
was
over.
the
master
at
that
time
as
at
other
times
does
have
the
authority
to
order
interim
detention
of
the
juvenile.
there
is
nothing
special
about
that
time.
there
is
no
special
privilege
or
prerogative
that
the
master
has
at
that
time
to
order
detention
as
opposed
to
some
other
time.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
certainly
having
found
him
non-delinquent,
he
is
not
going
to
order
him
detained
and
that
is
this
case.
mr.
smith
has
gone
on
at
great
length
about
the
perfunctory
nature
of
the
judge’s
review
of
the
master’s
recommendations.
again,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
this
case
involves
cases
which
go
up
on
exception.
they
are
heard,
they
are
argued,
they
are
considered
extensively
by
the
judges.
they
are
not
perfunctorily
reviewed.
the
other
cases
as
to
which
no
exceptions
are
filed,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
the
extent
that
it
feels
that
how
those
cases
were
handled
to
look
at
page
49
of
the
appendix
which
is
the
stipulation
of
judge
karwacki,
not
as
mr.
smith
indicated
one
minute
per
case
but
a
minimum
of
15
to
20
minutes
per
case
sometimes
hours,
sometimes
listing
to
the
recording,
this
again,
in
cases
where
none
of
the
parties
are
taking
exceptions,
not
this
case.
mr.
smith
also
in
talking
about
part
one
of
our
argument
on
the
question
of
when
jeopardy
attached
indicated
that
the
state
has
changed
its
position
from
what
it
was
in
the
brief
and
said
that
in
the
brief,
we
referred
to
the
time
at
which
the
matter
is
heard
before
the
master
upon
the
taking
of
exception.
yes,
that
is
the
way
we
described
it
in
the
brief
because
perhaps
we
were
making
the
mistake
of
focusing
at
that
point
on
what
this
case
is
all
about,
cases
where
exceptions
are
taken.
there
is
no
difference
between
the
state’s
position
in
the
brief
and
at
argument.
it
is
when
the
case
gets
before
the
judge
we
say
that
jeopardy
attaches.
when
an
exception
is
taken,
that
is
when
the
exception
is
presented
to
the
judge
and
the
case
is
heard.
in
the
other
case,
in
the
lion’s
share
of
other
cases,
it
is
when
the
file
goes
before
the
judge
with
the
master’s
recommendation.
thank
you
very
much.
