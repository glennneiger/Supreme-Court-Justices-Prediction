and
if
he
did
that
would
he
still
go
off
the
training
school?
justice
potter
stewart
would
he
commence
serving,
wherever
confinement,
in
whatever
place
the
master
had
recommended
as
a
punishment
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
be
detained
just
as
a
person
that
can
be
detained
after
prosecuting,
the
attorney
files
and
information
and
designate
bail.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
we
have
to
do
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
final
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
can
he
say
look
i
am
not
ready.
you
have
no
right
to
make
me
begin
serving
the
recommended
period
of
confinement
because
i
have
taken
an
exception
to
the
finding
of
delinquency.
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
take
an
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
is
the
recommended
period.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
committed
with
a
training
school
until
you
are
18
years
old.
justice
potter
stewart
your
complaint,
your
grievances,
in
this
case
it
is
not
with
a
situation
where
the
person
is
found
to
be
delinquent
by
the
master
but
rather
when
he
is
found
to
be
non-delinquent
by
the
master.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
not
saying
that
in
cases
where
the
master
finds
no
delinquency
and
the
state
takes
exceptions
and
brings
it
before
the
judge,
that
99
and
a
plus
percent
of
those
cases,
the
judge
agrees
with
the
masters
finding
a
no
delinquency.
you
are
not
telling
us
that,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
case
and
my
questions
earlier
threw
us
off
the
track
and
i
apologize,
your
case
is
a
case
where
the
juvenile
is
found
non-delinquent
by
the
master
and
the
state
takes
an
exception
and
then
takes
it
to
the
judge
and
certainly
you
are
not
telling
us
that
in
99
plus
percent
of
the
cases,
the
judge
agrees
that
there
is
no
delinquency,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
the
only
relevant
statistic
in
your
case,
which
is
your
case
presupposes
a
finding
of
non-delinquency
by
the
master
and
exceptions
by
the
state
that
is
your
case
and
that
is
the
only
issue
you
raise.
the
issue
posed
by
that
factual
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
most
of
the
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
case,
the
master
has
acquitted
them
so
the
question
does
not
arise.
it
is
important.
justice
potter
stewart
you
better
stick
to
you
case.
do
not
let
us
throw
you
off
but
let
us
get
back
to
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
it
where
a
grand
jury
is
ignored
a
true
bill.
it
has
not
indicted
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
an
analogy,
you
have
a
case
where
a
grand
jury
has
not
indicted
somebody
after
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
the
necessary
part
of
your
argument
as
i
now
understand
it
mr.
smith
is
that
in
the
line
share
of
cases
after
a
master
has
recommended
a
finding
of
non-delinquency
that
judge
does
rubber
stamp
it.
that
has
to
be
part
of
your
argument
which
you
are
now
making.
justice
potter
stewart
having
--
found
a
non-delinquent,
the
master
would
not
have
a
case.
