justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
is
a
restraining
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
understand
why
this
case
has
to
moved
now?
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
apply
for
a
marriage
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
have
been
married
and
divorced
and
remarried
by
now
could
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
we
have,
what
is
he
complaining
about
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
can
all
of
them,
register
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
not
a
judge
--
in
this
case
if
there
is
another
child
about
to
be
born
illegitimately
and
this
man
wants
to
marry
the
girl,
in
order
to
give
that
child
meaning,
the
judge
would
not
give
him
that
permission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
does
the
refusal,
if
he
remarries
you
still
cannot
get
the
money
out
him,
can
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
the
refusal
to
get
--
to
permit
him
to
marry,
get
the
money
to
the
child?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
he
gets
married.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
how
does
that
make
him
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
do
not
understand,
you
can
still
--
how
do
you
collect
the
money,
you
can
sue
him,
right
in
wisconsin
how
do
you
collect
this
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
support
money
how
do
you
collect
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
does
his
marring
prevent
the
clerk
from
doing
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
listen
to
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
they
preventing
him
from
marrying,
prevent
the
clerk
no
--
how
would
his
marrying
prevent
the
clerk
from
collecting
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
saves
the
clerk
from
going
through
the
motion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
who
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
the
clerk
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
here
is
a
man
who
says
i
will
not
give
my
child
a
nickel,
now
what
does
the
state
of
wisconsin
do
to
get
the
nickel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
can
do
that
whether
he
gets
married
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
way
can
they
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
contempt
powers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
can
do
that,
he
can
do
that
after
his
marriage
too
can
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
good
is
it
stopping
him
from
marrying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
moral.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
already
incurred
one
did
not
you
say
illegitimate
child
coming
along.
well
he
has
already
incurred
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ever
tell
the
trial
judge
that
he
was
a
married
man
when
he
was
asking
for
permission
to
get
married.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
do
you
think
that
is
proper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
it
is
proper,
to
mislead
a
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
did
he
tell
him
that
he
had
invalidly
married?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
not
you
think
he
should
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
get
married
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
do
not
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
with
all
of
this
imagination,
do
not
you
think,
it
was
your
duty
as
a
lawyer
and
a
member
of
the
bar
to
give
the
judge
the
true
facts
of
the
case
that
you
are
representing
to
him
the
truth.
the
whole
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
did
you
think,
then
you
should
tell
the
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
blondis,
what
worries
me
is,
you
spending
so
much
time
trying
to
make
your
client's
child
illegitimate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
make
the
marriage
invalid,
the
child
would
be
illegitimate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
are
spending
a
whole
lot
of
time
now
trying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
why
--
then
the
state
should
not
put
support
orders
in
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
say
that
109
does
not
do
any
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
is
what
i
thought
we
would
do
the
child
some
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
the
state
is
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
go
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
was
wondering
is
the
statute
--
i
do
not
know
(inaudible)
is
peculiar
to
me
as
to
any
other
statute
in
wisconsin
is
a
normal
procedure
to
present
statute
that
are
limited
to
the
court
decision
and
say
so
in
this
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
a
child
becomes
a
multimillionaire
i
think
it
will
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
allege
that
even
one
--
every
county
was
represented?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
member
of
your
class
in
every
county.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
allege
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
you
do
not,
then
i
see
why
you
need
every
county
clerk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
that
problem
is
unanswered
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
problem
is
unanswered.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
at
issue
is
a
wisconsin
statute
which
requires
persons,
subject
to
child
support
decrees,
to
obtain
court
permission
before
they
get
married.
permission
to
marry
can
not
be
granted
unless
the
applicant
first
submits
proof
of
compliance
with
the
support
obligation
and
second
demonstrates
that
the
children
will
not
become
public
charges.
appellee,
redhail,
was
unable
to
satisfy
either
of
these
conditions
with
respect
to
an
illegitimate
child
he
had
fathered
when
he
was
still
in
the
high
school.
after
being
denied
a
marriage
license,
he
brought
this
class
action
charging
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
held
that
the
law
had
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
and
enjoined
its
enforcement.
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
hold
that
the
right
to
marry
is
of
fundamental
importance.
since
the
classification
created
by
the
statute
significantly
interferes
with
the
exercise
of
that
right,
we
believe
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
critical
examination
of
the
state
interest,
master
the
support
of
the
law.
none
of
the
stateâ€™s
interest
that
have
been
suggested
can
withstand
close
scrutiny.
the
state
has
numerous
other
names
for
enforcing
support
obligations
and
in
many
cases,
such
as
appellee's,
the
statute
simply
prevents
people
from
getting
married,
without
benefiting
the
children
in
need
of
support.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
