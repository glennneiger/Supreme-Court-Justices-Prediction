chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-879,
zablocki
against
redhail.
mr.
johnson,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
approach
you
from
the
other
side.
if
the
statute
which
is
now
on
the
governor's
desk
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
would
there
be
any
case?
that
is
what
i
think
we
are
trying
to
prove
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
still
would
have
had
to
seek
the
approval
of
the
court?
if
the
new
statute
had
been
in
effect,
this
new
statute
we
are
talking
about
it,
had
been
in
effect
then,
he
would
still
have
to
goto
the
court,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
we
come
to
what,
we
have
been
trying
to
get
at.
is
there
a
case
left
here,
if
the
new
statute
is
signed
by
the
governor
tomorrow
or
the
next
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
presumably
if
he
went
into
court
and
showed
that
he
had
a
job
making
$900
a
month
and
paid
up
the
arrearages
and
the
child
was
off
of
welfare,
then
you
suggest
the
permission
would
have
been
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
wisconsin
recognize
common
law
marriages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blondis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
fundamental
right
for
a
person
12
years
old?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
when
the
state
passes
this
statute
saying
that
they
can
not
marry
under
the
age
of
18
is
not
one
of
the
reason
attributable
to
the
legislature
that
most
people
under
18
are
not
able
to
support
wives
and
children.
is
that
not
one
of
the
consideration
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
not
that
not
that
a
reasonable
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
legislature.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that
is
a
good
argument
to
advance
to
a
legislature,
but
it
does
not
carry
much
weight
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
not
capable
of
supporting
this
child.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
consider
also
if
you
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
submitting
a
memorandum
each
of
you
on
the
impact
statute.
now
justice
marshall's
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
johnson
do
you
think
in
your
two
remaining
minutes
there
is
anything
you
can
do
to
help
clarify
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hear
none,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
76-879,
zablocki
against
redhail
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
