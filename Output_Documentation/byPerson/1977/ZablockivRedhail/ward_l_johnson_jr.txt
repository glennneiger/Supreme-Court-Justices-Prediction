mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
which
declared
a
wisconsin
state
statute
imposing
a
marriage,
certain
marriage
requirement
unconstitutional.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
named
plaintiff
redhail,
six
years
ago
approximately
fathered
a
baby
girl
out
of
wedlock.
at
that
time
he
was
in
high
school.
two
years
subsequent
he
applied
for
permission
to
marry
to
the
county
clerk
of
milwaukee
county
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
because
of
a
marriage
requirement,
the
clerk
denied
him
a
license.
the
requirement
that
was
the
basis
for
the
denial
by
the
county
clerk
was
that
a
person
who
has
minor
children,
not
in
his
custody
to
whom
he
has
an
obligation
to
support
must
get
permission
from
a
court
to
marry.
in
mr.
redhail's
case
he
had
never
been
married.
we
suspect
the
bulk
of
the
cases
arising
where
there
has
been
--
where
there
is
a
requirement
to
get
a
court's
permission
to
marry
are
those
cases
involving
people
who
have
been
divorced,
who
have
been
married
before.
at
this
point
mr.
redhail
filed
a
complaint
with
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
petitioning
the
court
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
infringed
or
impinged
upon
his
constitutional
right
to
marry.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
assembly
bill
100
was
passed
by
both
houses
last
friday,
it
is
now
on
the
governor's
desk
for
signature.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
nothing.
the
legislature
has
preserved
the
statute
in
question
here
245.10
intact,
of
course
its
operation
has
been
suspended
by
the
injunction
of
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
in
our
belief
it
does
not.
let
me
explain
further
justice
brennan.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
we
do
not
know
whether
his
ardor
has
cooled
or
not.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
he
has
not
applied
for
a
license.
he
did
not
apply
for
a
license
up
to
the
time
of
the
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
no
there
is
not.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes,
assembly
bill
100
which
is
now
before
the
governor
for
signature,
retains
the
present
statute
intact.
its
operation
is
suspended,
when
there
is
any
injunction
in
joining
the
enforcement
procedures
under
245.10.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
it
was
--
it
is
tailor-made
legislation
to
accommodate
this
appeal.
if
this
court.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
as
long
as
there
is
an
injunction
pending
restraining
the
enforcement
of
that
statute
an
another
statute
comes
into
play
that
slightly
modifies
the
statute
under
question.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
believe
because
of
the
accommodation
in
the
new
statute
to
give
the
court
greater
discretion,
in
terms
of
people
who
have
never
been
married
before
that
the
statute
--
that
there
would
be
no
--
that
mr.
redhail
would
not
have
been
a
suitable
representative,
plaintiff.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
not
mr.
redhail.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice
in
that,
that
statute
is
only
operative
when
there
is
a
restraining
order
against
the
enforcement
of
the
present
statute
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
by
the
three-judge
court,
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
yes
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
mr.
redhail
could
have
gotten
married
as
soon
as
the
court
issued
its
injunction.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
he
could
have
applied
for
a
marriage
license
under
the
restraining
order.
we
are
restrained
now
from
enforcing
245.10.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
because
of
the
restraining
order
issued
by
the
district
court,
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
we
have
a
class
action
that
embraces
all
people.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
they
all
could
because
of
the
restraining
order
under
the
statute,
that
might
become
operative,
they
would
have
to
--
if
they
have
been
divorced
they
would
have
to
go
to
a
court
for
permission
to
remarry.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes,
the
legislature
wanted
to
keep
the
statute
that
is
now
on
appeal
here,
the
decision
regarding
the
statute
intact.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
in
the
mean
time,
if
possible,
in
the
mean
time
they
have
enacted
this
interim
statute.
if
this
court
affirms
the
restraining
order
of
the
three-judge
court,
the
new
statute
will
be
in
effect
and
for
all
practical
purposes
the
present
statute
is
dead.
but
should
this
court
lift
the
restraining
order
of
the
three-judge
court,
the
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
immediately
springs
back
into
life.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
the
old
statute
springs
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
not
moot
that
the
legislature
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
so,
mr.
redhail
filed
a
complaint
with
the
district
court
and
at
this
point
i
would
point
out
that
he
did
not
go
to
a
judge
to
seek
permission
to
remarry
and
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
have
made
a
great
point
of
a
fact
that
the
statute
permits
a
judge
to
grant
permission
when
he
finds
that
the
child
of
the
non-custodial
parent
is
a
public
charge
or
likely
to
become
a
public
charge.
mr.
redhail
felt
that
apparently
that
he
could
never
meet
the
test
required
by
or
likely
to
become
a
public
charge.
this
phrase
has
been
construed
by
wisconsin
court.
if
construed
very
narrowly
i
would
suggest
that
it
could
be
acquainted
with
a
settling
of
accounts
up-to-date.
it
is
on
the
basis
of
this
that
we
have
suggested
perhaps
the
district
court
might
have
abstained
as
suggested
in
reetz
versus
bozanich
and
subsequent
cases
under
that
doctrine.
now
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
this
should
be
a
class
action
carefully
noting
in
their
decision
that
we
have
two
classes
really
of
plaintiffs.
one
the
named
plaintiff
who
had
never
been
married
before
and
the
other
category
would
be
people
who
had
been
married
before
and
were
divorced.
they
also
found
and
certified
as
a
class
all
of
the
county
clerks
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
we
have
72
county
clerks,
the
class
is
very
easily
identifiable.
we
objected
an
oral
argument
as
noted
in
the
court's
decision
to
certifying
such
a
class
without
notification
to
the
71
other
county
clerks.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
there
was
no
determination
on
this
particular
case
as
whether
the
child
was
a
public
charge,
but
the
child
was
an
afdc
recipient
and
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
redhail
would
not
have
obtained
judicial
permission
to
remarry
because
of
the
afdc
benefits
being
extended
to
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
do
not
know
we
are
speculating
about
the
future
but
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
not
without
paying
up
the
arrearages
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
okay,
but
it
is
possible
that
had
he
paid
up
his
arrearages
and
showed
his
ability
to
meet
the
support
order,
that
he
would
have
secured
judicial
permission
to
marry
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
if
he
was
on
afdc,
no.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
she
was
at
the
time.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes
it
is
the
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
the
statute
says
so,
the
rationale
i
suppose
justice
blackmum
being
that
the
custodial
parent
already
has
a
burden
of
the
care
and
has
the
right
to
expect
contribution
from
the
non-custodial
parent.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
sure.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
law
is
absolutely
perfect
and
there
are
no
gaps,
loopholes,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them.
we
do
the
best
we
can
in
terms
of
a
standard
for
marriage
requirements.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well.
lets
look
at
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
presumably,
but
at
least
here
we
have
a
record
to
go
on.
whereas
we
do
not
have
an
case
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
we
do
not
know.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
if
i
were
to
predict.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
judge
would
probably
stick
by
the
statute
and
refuse.
but
that
is
just
my
prediction
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
the
policy
is
that
we
are
not
going
to
condone
by
a
piece
of
paper
called
a
marriage
license.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
so,
that
is
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
the
statute.
but
there
is
something
that
could
be
said
on
the
other
side
too
and
i
guess
that
is
why
i
am
here.
alright
the
three-judge
court
then
certified
a
class
action
for
all
of
the
named
defendants,
at
oral
argument
we
objected
on
the
basis
of
no
notice
to
them.
the
courts,
the
circuit
courts
are
split
on
this
one
following
the
ironclad
rule
given
orders.
the
other
circuit
saying
well
if
there
is
adequate
representation,
the
notice
can
be
dispensed
with.
now
that
the
judge,
three-judge
court
said
this
statute
of
wisconsin
impinges
upon
a
fundamental
right.
right
to
marry
and
that,
this
requirement
of
going
to
the
judge
and
getting
permission
to
remarry
impinges
upon
that
fundamental
right
and
it's
therefore
suspect
statute
and
follows
that
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
sustain
its
validity
and
we
object
on
this
appeal
to
the
application
of
this
stringent
result
oriented
type
of
test.
i
think
it
was
back
in
united
states
v.
carolene
products
where
a
footnote
by
the
writer
of
that
opinion
indicated
that
statutes
are
entitled
to
a
strong
presumption
of
constitutionality
except
perhaps
where
there
is
a
right
expressly
set
forth
in
the
constitution
itself.
this
idea
of
course
is
grown
and
combinated
as
we
pointed
out
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
in
1969
when
the
court
found
that
the
right
to
travel,
and
of
course
it
was
in
connection
with
welfare
benefits
was
a
fundamental
right
and
the
state
had
to
show
some
compelling
state
interest
that
would
over
ride
this
impingement
or
this
entitlement
to
exercise
the
fundamental
right.
since
that
time
that
case,
the
boddie
case
on
right
to
divorce,
the
griswold
case
have
all
been
cited
in
terms
of
their
language
to
suggest
this
familial
privacy
right
and
to
suggest
that
anything
that
touches
upon
the
marriage
the
right
to
marriage
all
of
its
collateral
attributes
is
suspect
and
subject
to
this
test.
though
we
note
that
in
the
iowa
case
regarding
the
durational
residency
requirement
of
iowa,
shapiro
versus
thompson
doctrine
of
compelling
state
interest
was
not
applied.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
it
does
not.
now
justice
harlan
in
his
decent
in
shapiro
pointed
out
the
danger
of
labeling
something
as
a
fundamental
right
which
invokes
this
as
we
call
it
result
oriented
test,
stringent
test
that
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
to
override
the
impingement.
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
okay,
expressed
in
the
constitution,
i
presume.
but
now
we
are
talking
about
rights
that
are
not.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
expressly
contained
in
the
constitution.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
and
i
think
it
is
a
fundamental
right
that
a
youngster
should
be
supported
by
his
parents.
we
talk
about
rights,
we
have
duties.
the
right
to
get
married,
procreate
has
an
attendant
duty
to
support
children
of
that
marriage.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
true,
there
are
other
laws
with
respect
to
the
afdc
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
it
requires
him
to
square
up
accounts,
to
pay
the
arrearages.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
it
makes
him
do
it.
we
had
resolution
from
enumerable
county
boards
requesting
us
to
take
this
appeal.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well
if
he
is
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
alright
the
county
--
the
clerk
of
the
court
collects
the
money
in
an
ordinary
case.
a
divorce
case
or
a
support
case.
clerk
of
the
court
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
because
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
alright.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well,
the
actual
fact
of
his
marrying,
remarrying
or
marrying
would
not
prevent
the
clerk
from
collecting
the
money,
but
it
puts
pressure
on
him
to
bring
himself
up-to-date
with
the
respect
to
arrearages.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well,
the
clerk
does
not
--
the
clerk
just
receives
the
money,
he
does
not
enforce
support
obligations.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
the
custodial
parent.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
you
asked
me
how
does
the
money
mechanically
gotten
to
the
child
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
where
it
is
willful,
they
can
press
criminal
charges.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
the
private
person
can
bring
an
action
for
contempt.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes
he
can.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
the
pressure
it
puts
upon
him.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
moral.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
to
square
accounts.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
and
incurring
further
obligation.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
okay,
and
before
he
incurs
further
let
us
have
him
face
up
to
the
responsibility
that
he
has
already
acquired.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
well.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
for
mr.
redhail
it
does
not
seem
to
do
very
much,
but
down
the
line
somewhere,
he
is
going
to
be
called
to
square
accounts
if
he
wants
that
piece
of
paper
from
state
of
wisconsin
saying,
hey
we
condone
your
marriage.
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
point
out
that
in
its
domestic
relation
policy,
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
attempted
to
affect
a
higher
standard
of
conduct
than
is
normally
been
expected.
we
have
been
shot
down
by
the
three-judge
court
who
failed
--
which
failed
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
custodial
spouse,
the
interest
of
the
child,
the
protection
of
the
child
and
i
point
out
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
annunciated
by
our
supreme
court
state
of
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
state
(inaudible)
is
to
protect
the
child
and
protect
the
integrity
of
the
marital
relationship,
that
is
all.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
down
the
line
it
is
perhaps
a
deter,
that
you
cannot
walk
out
a
family
and
--
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ward
l.
johnson,
jr.
i
will
along
with
counsel
for
the
appellee
submit
a
memorandum,
with
respect
to
the
new
law,
which
the
governor
we
expect
will
sign
and
i
will
ask
any
question
in
remaining
two
minutes
that
any
--
