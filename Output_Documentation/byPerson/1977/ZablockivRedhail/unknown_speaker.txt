unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
is
the
statute
still
operative?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
new
legislation?
unknown
speaker
well
if
he
signs
it,
it
becomes
law?
unknown
speaker
then
what
happens
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
new
legislation
does
not
affect
the
statute
before
us?
unknown
speaker
does
mr.
redhail
still
want
to
marry
the
girl?
unknown
speaker
she
has
not
married
in
the
mean
time?
unknown
speaker
is
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
he
has
had
a
second
child?
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to
tell
me
mr.
attorney
general
--
unknown
speaker
has
it
been
raised
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well
as
i
understand
if
that
statute
becomes,
when
the
governor
signs
it,
that
automatically
since
there
is
an
outstanding
injunction
here,
suspends
the
operation
of
the
statute
we
have
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
the
new
statute
becomes
operative
which
means
mr.
redhail
then
can
get
married
without
applying
to
a
court
for
permission
to
get
married.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
then
the
new
statute
would
be
inoperative.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
sub-section
8
on
page
4
of
this
supplemental
memorandum
of
the
appellees,
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
to
which
your
are
referring
i
think.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
statute
kind
of
a
second
line
of
defense
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
if
possible.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
if
we
reverse
and
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
old
statute,
the
new
statute
then
becomes
inoperative.
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
to
got
to
decide
the
cases
is
what
you
are
telling?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
would
agreed
it
would
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr
johnson
let
me
go
back
to
question,
you
indicated
there
was
nothing
on
the
record
that
implied
they
had
a
second
child.
in
the
plaintiff
or
in
the
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
he
was
adjudged
to
be
the
father
of
a
baby
girl
born
in
1970
and
i
also
read
plaintiff
desires
to
marry
he
and
the
woman
he
intends
to
marry
are
expecting
a
child
to
be
born
to
them
in
early
march
1975.
my
question
is
was
that
child
ever
born?
unknown
speaker
mr
johnson
could
i
go
back
one
point
that
--
you
said
that
the
reason
that
perhaps
the
court
could
have
abstained
was
that
the
likely
to
become
a
public
charge
language
might
or
might
not
apply,
but
is
not
the
child
now
a
public
charge?
did
not
the
district
court
find
that?
unknown
speaker
then
he
would
not
have
any
occasion
to
worry
about
the
likely
to
become
a
public
charge
language?
unknown
speaker
the
matter
as
to
this
particular
litigant.
we
know
that
he
could
not
have
gotten
the
approval.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
he
payed
the
arrearage
the
child
would
still
be
a
public
charge.
is
not
that
true?
as
long
as
she
is
receiving
a
$109
a
month,
from
afdc.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argue.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
child
was
still
on
afdc?
unknown
speaker
alright
and
she
is
on
afdc.
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
i
was
trying
to
help
you
out
wondering
whether
there
was
a
second
one
that
he
spawned.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
so
the
state
of
wisconsin
public
policy
is,
it
is
better
to
have
two
illegitimate
children
than
one.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
condone
it,
you
will
compel
it.
unknown
speaker
shapiro
held
that
not
that
the
right
of
interstate
travel
is
a
constitutional
right,
constitutional
protected
right.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
emphasized
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
it
was
more
than
just
a
subjective
view
of
this
court
that
it
was
a
fundamental
right,
but
held
rather
that
it
was
a
right
of
interstate
travel
as
contrasted
with
international
travel
is
constitutionally
protected
freedom.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
that
is
it.
unknown
speaker
well
it
does
prevent
him
from
undertaking
another
legal
obligation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
at
least
the
complaint
says
he
has
already
incurred
a
second
one.
unknown
speaker
so
what
does
your
statute
do?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
just
one
question
which
marital
relationship
is
it
protecting,
there
was
no
marital
relationship
at
all
here,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
preexisting
marriage
if
there
was
one.
unknown
speaker
it
maybe
invalid
by
the
wisconsin
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
--
i
am
just
curious,
i
guess
it
is
not
here,
but
here
you
have
got
a
statute,
wisconsin
statute,
that
is
proposed
to
be
operative
on
an
illinois
marriage.
unknown
speaker
so,
so,
so?
while
he
--
unknown
speaker
did
he
ever
tell
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
was
the
child
born?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
do
not
understand
why
would
you--
why
you
say
so
readily
that
the
marriage
is
void.
unknown
speaker
wisconsin
law
stays
another
state
marriage.
you
do
not
suppose
as
any
questions
about
that.
i
suppose
it
was
just
a
matter
of
age
under
wisconsin
law.
male
can
not
marry
before
he
is
21.
he
happen
to
be
19.
but,
the
age
in
illinois
was
18.
unknown
speaker
was
this,
one
of
those
overnight
trips
to
waukegan?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
legal
predicament
with
respect
to
the
present
--
to
his
additional
marriage,
illinois
is
not
going
to
be
affected
whether
he
win
or
lose
this
case.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
can
get
a
license.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but,
just
wining
this
case
is
not
going
to
validate
the
marriage.
is
not
going
to
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
mr.
blondis?
if
the
statute
is
invalid,
it
is
no
longer,
presents
any
impediment
to
the
validity
of
the
illinois
marriage.
but,
that
--
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
surely
is
going
to
paragraph
five
of
the
statute
and
the
marriage
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
we
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
it
void
and
the
marriage
would
be
good.
i
do
not
understand
why
the
marriage
can
be
bad
is
the
statute
is
bad.
unknown
speaker
that
is
provision,
that
provision
just
is
not
an
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
you
see
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
statute.
yes,
that
is
right,
because
it
says
any
marriage
in
fact
without
compliance
with
this
section,
without
compliance
if
we
hold
the
section
which
needs
to
be
complied
was
invalid
there
is
no
non-compliance.
unknown
speaker
but,
245
was
never
a
tact
on
that
grounds
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
is
the
second
child
living
with
redhail
now?
unknown
speaker
is
the
woman
that
he
purported
to
marry
in
illinois
living
with
him.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blondis,
the
class
certification
was
on
february
20
on
the
1975
as
i
understand
it.
is
a
marriage
before
or
after
that.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
class
had
been
certified
before
the
illinois
marriage
took
place.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
father
has
no
responsibility?
unknown
speaker
but
it
not
up
to
the
state
to
justify
the
statute
is
it?
the
state
has
enacted
the
statute
and
it
is
presentively
constitutionally
valid.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
telling
us
that
state
could
have
enacted
some
other
legislation.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
enact
this
legislature
and
the
question
is
it
constitutionally
valid?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
always
true
with
any
law.
unknown
speaker
well
marrying
him.
unknown
speaker
there
are
230
million
or
i
guess
115
million
people;
males
in
united
states.
unknown
speaker
what
about
most
if
not
all
state
have
laws
that
a
tell
a
man
how
is
married
to
somebody
else
that
he
can
not
get
married
because
he
is
married
to
somebody
else.
this
i
suppose
does
not
in
fact
prohibit
him
from
impregnating
some
other
female,
you
think
that
such
a
state
law
would
be
unconstitutional
just
because
particularly
as
it
affects
somebody
how
has
made
some
other
woman
pregnant.
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
does
not
your
argument
run
the
--
make
equally
invalid
bigamy
law.
i
said
was
a
disqualification
not
a
criminal
thing
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
a
man
wants
to
marry
his
sister
and
the
state
says
you
can
not
do
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
only
because
of
statutory
laws
is
in
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
kind
of
a
natural
law
argument
to
us,
judeo-christian
morality.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
legislature
can
only
enact
the
thing
that
you
regard
as
traditional
onto
the
notions
of
marriage.
unknown
speaker
you
say
justifiable,
you
suggest
the
state
has
to
justify
that
legislation?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
lay
down
some
principal
reason
for
ruling
in
your
favor
if
it
does
so
and
i
take
your
suggestion
that
some
principal
reason
can
be
laid
down
that
would
not
also
invalidate
bigamy
statute,
well
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well
how
does
it
determine
its
own
individual
merits
issue,
but
i
thought
that
was
with
the
legislature.
unknown
speaker
how
about
your
client.
unknown
speaker
in
that
respect,
i
am
not
--
it
might
be
true
a
lot
of
other
people,
but
you
are
entitled
to
raise
that
unless
you
have
some
concrete
objection
on
this
regard.
unknown
speaker
well
does
the
other
side
object
to
the
class
of
designation.
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
think
you
can
raise
the
problems
of
the
indigent
even
though
you
petitioner,
your
client
might
be
wealthy.
unknown
speaker
well
so
you
say
your
client
is
indigent
or
no.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
i
really
wanted
to
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blondis
are
you
going
to
come
at
the
new
statute.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
him
that
if
we
reverse
the
lower
court
here
and
sustain
the
statute
the
new
statute
statute
becomes
--
is
not
applicable.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blondis
may
we
ask
you
and
the
attorney
of
general
both
to
let
us
know
forthwith
when
the
governor
moves
on
the
bill
that
is
pending
on
his
desk.
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
know
whether
it
is
approved.
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
over
right
provision
in
wisconsin.
if
it
is
veto.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blondis
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
financial
circumstances
of
the
wife
of
the
plaintiff,
the
present
wife.
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
if
had
alleged
that
she
was
a
very
wealthy
person
it
would
have
enabled
him
to
discharge
the
support
obligation.
he
still
could
have
married
her.
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
want
a
defendants
class?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
want
a
class
of
defendants
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
surely
it
is
a
court
decision
affecting
one
would
be
honored
by
every
other
county
clerk
in
the
state,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
and
he
only
wants
one
marriage
license,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
so
why
does
he
need
72
county
clerks
to
be
enjoined?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
class
action,
mr.
blondis?
unknown
speaker
why
is
everybody
is
so
eager
to
get
class
actions
going
on
both
side
of
the
case.
is
this
the
law
school
theory
these
days
or
what
is
it?[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well
is
it
not
a
fact
in
wisconsin
that
during
the
abortions
litigation
they
ignore
the
orders
in
certain
districts
and
then
they
had
to
do
it
class
action.
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
--
