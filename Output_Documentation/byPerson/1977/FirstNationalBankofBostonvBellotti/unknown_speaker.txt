unknown
speaker
they
can
log
on
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
under
the
state
law
--
unknown
speaker
are
they
necessarily
corporations,
i
noticed
they
are
all
listed
--
are
we
to
take
it
at
least
you
believe
those
organizations
list
on
page
46
are
in
that
corporation.
unknown
speaker
then
what
does
it
provide
--
unknown
speaker
so
we
would
add
and
not
eliminate
these
restrictions
and
would
add
others
--.
unknown
speaker
the
very
first
issue
is
it
not
mr.
fox,
is
whether
a
corporation
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
i
mean
we
all
know
that
the
new
york
times
company
and
the
producer
of
a
movie
or
those
corporations
are
and
there
are
many
cases
so
holding
but
are
there
any
cases
holding
explicitly
that
corporations
like
the
riggs
bank
or
general
motors
are
your
client,
the
first
national
bank?
unknown
speaker
whether
that
corporation
has
a
first
amendment
right,
at
least
to
the
same
vigor
as
an
individual
human
being
does.
unknown
speaker
the
corporation
can
not
have
opinions,
that
is
unanimous,
its
agents
can
but
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
fox
would
it
be
constitutional
for
a
state
to
provide
that
no
corporation
may
publish
a
newspaper
unless
its
articles
have
been
corporation
expressly
granted
that
power.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
about
this
statute
but
your
submission
is
that
the
state
may
not
limit
a
corporation
to
business
other
than
news
paper
publishing.
any
corporation
once
incorporated
has
the
right
to
publish
a
news
paper.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
any
--
i
take
it
you
disagree
that
a
corporation
may
be
prevented
from
communicating
about
a
political
issue
that
does
not
affect
its
interest?
unknown
speaker
why
not
--
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
do
say
that
it
is
a
contrary
to
first
amendment
to
limit
the
communications
in
that
manner?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
you
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
massachusetts
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
the
interest
that
corporation
have
to
be
involved
before
you
may
communicate
about
an
election
issue?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
were
to
accept
it?
what
if
we
were
to
accept
the
legislative
declaration
that
individual
income
taxes
do
not
affect
your
interest
at
all?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
is
your
opinion
but
what
if
we
assume,
what
if
we
agreed
with
the
legislative
declaration
that
individual
income
taxes
do
not
involve
the
corporate
interest
and
therefore
the
corporation
may
not
communicate.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
position
would
have
any
bearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act?
which
forbids
the
corporations
from
contributing
in
federal
elections?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
principle,
--
you
do
not
think
that
principle
that
you
are
furthering
here
would
undermine
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
are
beginning
with
the
second
step,
are
you
not?
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggested
his
question,
and
you
agreed
with
him
and
your
answer
massachusetts
or
any
other
state
can
say
that
individuals
in
this
state,
you
cannot
carry
on
business
at
all
in
corporate
form.
unknown
speaker
and
the
corporation
was
generally
of
each
state
set
out
the
conditions
under
which
individuals
can
associate
together
in
order
to
carry
out
their
joint
endeavors
in
corporate
form.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
they
can
say
to
individuals
all
of
them
of
course
have
individually
are
protected
and
have
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
you
can
in
corporate
form
only
carry
out
your
individual
rights
subject
to
these,
those
are
the
other
conditions
and
is
that
not
sort
of
like
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction
on
how
and
where
and
individual
can
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
must
they
say,
in
this
state
you
can
only
incorporate
for
purposes
of
carrying
on
the
grocery
business
and
for
no
other?
unknown
speaker
and
require
i
suppose
to
registration
identification.
unknown
speaker
kindly,
is
that
only
true
if
the
graduated
income
tax
materially
affects
the
business
and
corporation?
unknown
speaker
on
that,
on
any
issue
they
can
lobby
without
limit.
unknown
speaker
into
the
legislature
or
to
the
voters?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
true
that
if
your
position
is
correct,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
massachusetts
could
withdraw
the
privilege
of
trying
to
influence
the
legislature
by
spending
money?
unknown
speaker
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
can
say
that
their
business
interests
are
not
affected
by
an
individual
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
well
how
would
that
be
different,
i
do
not
understand
how
that
could
matter
whether
it
is
a
constitutional
amendment
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
the
votes
in
the
record
does
not
have
much
doubt
about
that,
but
can
happen
when
it
get
that
stages
there?
unknown
speaker
may
i
back
up
just
a
minute,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
if
the
appellants
in
this
case
had
been
able
to
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
massachusetts
court
that
their
business
interest
were
protected,
is
it
your
position
that
this
case
would
have
been
decided
differently
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
the
opinion
that
is
before
us
in
this
case,
i
am
looking
at
language
on
page
eight
of
the
appendix
of
jurisdictional
statement,
there
is
a
flat
sentence
that
says,
the
legislature
which
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
1972
amendment
has
specifically
proscribed
corporate
expenditures
of
money
relative
to
the
proposed
amendment.
there
is
other
language
in
the
opinion
that
also
supports
that
view,
it
is
very
confusing
it
seems
to
me
but,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
let
us
see
if
i
understand
this.
how
do
you
explain
the
presence
of
a
new
york
times
case?
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
you
explain
doran
against
the
salem
inn?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
have
to
prove
all
of
these
--
unknown
speaker
general,
may
i
come
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
a
little
while
ago?
will
you
take
a
look
at
page
19
of
the
appendix
of
the
jurisdictional
statement?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
opinion
of
your
court
and
that
part
of
the
opinion
is
addressing
the
vagueness
argument,
and
look
at
the
second
full
paragraph
that
starts
on
consideration
of
these
constitutional
guidelines
which
are
cases
involving
vagueness.
next
sentence
goes
on
to
say
this.
we
recognized
that
the
“materially
affects”
limitation,
they
are
general
in
nature,
good
as
that
saying
is
not
vague
but
we
also
note
that
the
statutory
of
proscription
in
question
here,
the
prohibition
against
corporate
expenditures
on
a
referendum
question,
solely
concerning
a
personal
income
tax
is
both
precise
and
definite.
i
have
read
that
plus
the
language
i
referred
to
earlier
had
indicating
that
your
court
would
say
that
quite
without
regard
to
affect
on
the
business
or
assets
of
a
corporation,
that
money
could
not
be
spent.
now,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
this
opinion?
unknown
speaker
you
do.
then
your
massachusetts
course
as
an
effect
almost
conceded
vagueness.
