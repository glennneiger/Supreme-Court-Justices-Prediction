mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
has
served
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
expend
money
to
influence
the
outcome
on
a
ballot
question,
which
was
presented
to
the
rulers
in
1976
and
which
would
have
authorized
the
imposition
of
a
graduated
personal
income
tax
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.
and
may
they
have
that
their
desires
relate
to
a
question
which
they
would
have
had
no
power
to
influence
directly
by
voting.
we
state
that
there
is
no
such
right
and
not
only
the
taxpayers
of
the
commonwealth
and
their
duly
elected
representatives
ought
to
be
able
to
decide
how
they
have
taxed.
and
despite
the
arguments
that
mr.
fox
has
just
earnestly
advanced,
we
think
there
are
real
differences
between
corporations
and
individuals
between
elections
of
officials
and
elections
on
referendum
issues
and
the
expression
of
voters’
sentiment
contained
in
referendum
votes.
and
between
the
graduated
income
tax
amendment,
which
appeared
on
the
1976
ballot
and
other
kinds
of
questions
and
i
think
that
before
we
reach
those
specific
differences
and
i
address
my
self
to
those,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
a
little
bit
about
the
way
the
massachusetts
statutory
framework
works.
in
massachusetts,
we
have
approximately
70
years
of
experience
for
the
ban
on
corporate
political
contributions
and
roughly
an
equivalent
amount
of
experience
with
questions
appearing
on
the
ballot.
throughout
the
history
of
the
massachusetts
statute,
the
prohibition
against
corporate
contributions
has
been
applied
to
questions
presented
to
the
voter
under
the
initiative
in
referendum
amendment
and
under
article
48
of
our
state
constitution
that
includes
constitutional
amendments
like
to
grant
tax.
under
the
massachusetts
statutory
framework,
the
popular
initiative
in
referendum
reserved
to
the
people
that
is
to
the
voters,
the
right
to
submit
questions
and
laws
to
the
voters
for
acceptance
or
rejection
when
the
normal
political
processes
do
not
work.
and
it
is
this
process,
this
narrow
process
that
massachusetts
seeks
to
eliminate
the
corporate
influence
from.
throughout
the
70
year
period
as
i
say
we
have
had
a
history
of
interaction
between
the
questions
which
appear
on
the
ballot
and
the
ban
on
corporate
contributions
but
it
has
not
been
a
static
history.
throughout
history,
we
have
evolved
a
statute
and
the
statute
now
we
think
at
least
complies
with
constitutional
standards.
for
the
last
14
years,
there
has
been
dialog
between
our
state
supreme
judicial
court
and
between
the
legislature
as
to
what
it
is
that
the
legislature
can
prescribe
by
way
of
corporate
contributions.
we
have
carved
out
a
process
for
the
people
to
within
which
they
can
interact
and
at
the
same
time
strive
to
protect
the
rights
of
businesses
to
contribute
to
questions,
which
in
some
way
might
materially
affect
them.
under
the
massachusetts
statutory
framework,
individual
citizens
can
contribute
up
to
$1,000.00
to
a
candidate,
to
a
community
organized
on
behalf
of
the
candidate,
to
a
political
party
or
to
committees
organized
on
behalf
of
the
questions,
which
appear
on
the
ballot.
business
corporations
and
any
kind
of
business
entity
which
carries
on
certain
kinds
of
enumerated
businesses,
generally
regulated
industries
like
banks,
canals,
railroads,
cannot
contribute
to
candidates,
cannot
contribute
to
committees
organized
on
their
behalf,
cannot
contribute
to
political
parties.
there
is
a
narrow
range
of
participation
open
to
them
under
the
massachusetts
framework
and
it
permits
them
to
contribute
to
questions
which
materially
affect
their
businesses
and
only
on
those
instances.
and
i
might
add
that
when
that
narrow
range
of
participation
is
open
to
them,
unlike
individual
citizens,
they
can
contribute
without
limit
and
they
may
expend
that
money
without
limit
in
order
to
protect
the
business
interests.
corporations
are
not
totally
excluded
from
the
referendum
process,
the
amendment
of
the
constitution
process,
they
have
a
number
of
roles
that
they
can
play
in
the
process.
in
order
for
a
constitutional
amendment
like
the
graduated
income
tax
to
appear
on
the
massachusetts
ballot,
it
has
to
first
be
a
affirmatively
voted
on
by
two
consecutive
legislatures
and
that
is
not
two
legislative
years,
that
is
two
separately
elected
legislators.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
banks
cannot
contribute
to
the
legislature
or
in
their
quest
for
elective
office.
what
they
can
do
and
what
any
business,
any
artificial
or
natural
entity
in
massachusetts
can
do,
is
contribute
and
expend
money
on
a
law
being
effort
while
the
matter
is
being
considered
in
the
legislature.
during
the
months
of
immediately
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
law
being
statutes
of
the
several
states.
i
am
familiar
with
the
election
statute
of
the
several
states
i
can
say
that
massachusetts
has
a
fairly
unique
statute
in
that
regard,
the
best
one
is
my
position.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
pay
lobby,
yes
sir.
we
do
have
a
comprehensive
legislative
agent
kind
of
statute,
which
does
restrict
the
forms,
which
of
communication
on
matters
before
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
is
a
standard
kind
of
stature.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
unlimited
expenditure
for
legislative
agents,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
that
is
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
that
is
correct.
any
artificial
entity,
any
natural
person
in
the
commonwealth
is
free
to
expend
that
limited
amounts
of
money
while
a
the
matter
is
before
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
my
answer
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
in
article
48
of
our
state
constitution,
we
have
carved
out
for
the
people
a
certain
process
by
which
they
can
respond
in
the
next
statutes
and
amend
their
constitution
when
the
normal
political
processes
are
not
available
to
them.
when
untoward
results
are
being
produced
by
the
legislature.
the
initiative
and
referendum
procedure,
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
issue
in
this
case
was
born
of
the
populous
movement
around
the
turn
of
the
century
and
was
designed
to
return
to
the
people
the
reigns
of
government
and
to
eliminate
the
big
business
influence
in
that
narrow
range
of
our
governmental
interest.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
in
the
last
two
elections,
you
have
in
the
record,
the
votes
of
the
legislatures,
they
are
overwhelming,
and
you
have
the
fact
that
they
were
defeated.
you
also
know
that
the
amount
of
money
that
was
expended
by
the
corporations
primarily
in
selling
the
particular
position
to
the
legislature
was
$120,000.00
to
7,000.00
or
$15,000.00
depending
upon
the
way
you
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
no,
that
is
to
the
voters.
that
is
in
advertising.
that
is
in
contributions
to
committees
which
favor
or
pose
the
question
in
1972
that
was
presented
to
the
voters
in
1972.
but
this
is
not
an
absolute
ban
on
corporate
participation
even
while
the
people’s
process,
the
referendum
process
is
going
on,
the
view
of
corporate
management
is
the
lower
court
opinion
makes
clear
can
be
disseminated
to
the
public
in
a
wide
variety
of
ways.
the
banks
may
publish
articles
in
in-house
publications.
they
may
hold
press
conferences.
they
may
hire,
they
may
use
the
economist
that
they
have
hired
to
make
public
statements.
there
is
a
whole
host
of
methods
for
that
corporate
view
to
be
disseminated
to
the
public.
the
only
restriction
that
is
operative
during
these
months
immediately
preceding
the
election
is
a
prohibition
against
the
expenditure
of
corporate
funds
to
influence
a
vote,
which
in
this
case
may
have
affected
the
corporate
management
and
their
taxation
but
which
could
not
have
affected
the
taxation
of
the
corporations.
after
the
amendment
passes,
this
is
not
a
self
executing
amendment.
in
order
for
a
tax
to
be
imposed,
it
would
again
have
to
go
back
to
the
legislature
and
the
legislature
would
have
had
to
enact
a
graduated
personal
income
tax.
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
lower
court
opinion
i
think
in
a
narrowing
construction
on
the
statute
makes
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
prohibition.
it
is
the
contribution,
expenditure,
or
funds
not
in
the
natural
course
of
business
that
is
interdicted
by
the
massachusetts
statute.
and
again,
after
the
amendment
has
passed,
when
it
is
before
the
legislature,
the
appellant’s
business
corporations
and
regulated
industries
have
a
free
hand
in
seeking
to
protect
their
interest
when
a
specific
tax
is
proposed.
so,
the
prescription
operates
only
in
a
very
narrow
time
frame
during
what
i
have
characterized
as
the
people’s
process
and
in
a
really
significant
respect,
the
rights
of
corporations,
when
they
cannot
participate
in
that
process
or
even
greater
than
those
of
individual
citizens
because
they
can
expend
their
expenditure
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
if
my
position
on
the
constitutional
aspects
of
the
case
is
correct,
that
massachusetts
can
clearly
eliminate
the
right
of
corporations
to
lobby
except
where
their
business
interests
are
affected.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
do
not
know
whether
the
judgment
in
a
particular
statute
would
be
as
defensible
as
it
is
in
the
matter
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
in
this
particular
question
that
was
presented
to
the
voters,
we
have
a
non-self
executing
statement
of
authorization
to
the
legislature
which
deals
only
with
personal
income
as
opposed
to
corporate
income
taxes.
passing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
personal
income
tax
can
have
an
impact
on
the
business
property
or
assets
of
corporation
will
still
face
with
the
fact
that
in
order
for
it
to
have,
for
there
to
be
any
conceivable
impact
on
the
business
itself,
the
legislature
at
some
point
would
have
to
take
an
additional
affirmative
step
and
impose
a
tax.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
there
may
be
grave
questions
as
to
the
form
of
the
particular
tax,
the
levels
of
taxation,
the
degrees
of
gradation.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
would
start
with
the
bold
proposition
that
corporations
have
no
first
amendment
rights
to
free
speech
per
se.
i
would
agree
with
the
court
below
that
to
the
extent
that
corporations
do
have
any
right
of
speech
that
they
have
an
incident
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
stem
from
some
right
to
protect
their
interests.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
recognize
that
the
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
alluding
to
the
suggestion
in
some
of
the
opinions
that
he
has
written
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
may
just
embody
the
principle
of
free
speech,
as
it
is
been
handed
down
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
not
the
position
that
i
advance
today.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
i
would
agree
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
position
that
i
advance
today
is
simply
that
the
lower
court
has
found
that
there
is
a
right
to
protect
businesses
whether
it
is
under
the
federal
constitution
or
the
state
constitution
and
that
we
will
abide
by
that
decision
by
the
lower
court,
under
the
state
constitution
if
not,
the
federal.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
would
take
a
position
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
would
say
that
you
do
not
and
you
would
not
simply
because
there
is
a
right
of
speech
when
business
interests
are
affected,
that
is
an
incident
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
opposed
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
amendment.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
if
you
had
read
again,
reread
the
first
first
national
case
in
1972,
there
is
a
suggestion
to
that
effect
in
that
opinion.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
challenge
that
was
brought
to
this
specific
statute
embodied
a
host
of
due
process,
equal
protection
kinds
of
challenges.
the
appellants’
challenged
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
them
and
asserted
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
contribute
or
expend
monies
when
there
was
a
material
effect.
justice
liakos
(ph)
in
his
opinion,
appears
to
have
agreed
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
state
constitution
confer
that
kind
of
right
and
finds
that
as
applied
to
these
particular
defendants
this
statute
is
not
unconstitutional.
he
also
appeals
to
concur
with
the
legislative
judgment
that
a
graduated
income
tax
amendment
on
its
face
can
have
no
impact
on
the
business
interest
of
specific
corporations.
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
on
rule
16
of
this,
i
will
turn
just
briefly
and
just
by
way
of
digression
to
the
mootness
arguments
that
have
been
raised
in
this
particular
case.
i
agree
with
mr.
fox,
that
there
is
a
doctrine
which
has
been
applied
by
these
another
appellate
courts
permitting
it
to
review
and
decide
cases
which
are
capable
of
repetition,
evading
review
even
after
this
specific
controversy
has
passed.
we
disagree
as
to
the
application
of
the
principle
to
this
particular
case.
we
do
not
believe
as
mr.
fox
asserts
that
this
case
is
likely
to
recur
in
any
real
sense.
in
the
60
years
since
we
have
our
current
form
of
amending
the
constitution
and
in
the
29
general
elections
that
have
passed,
the
a
graduated
income
tax
question
has
appeared
on
the
ballot
about
four
times
and
three
judicial
challenges
have
eventuated
challenging
the
corporate
prescription
against
contributions
to
oppose
or
favor
that
tax.
but
in
each
instance
that
the
nature
of
this
specific
amendment,
the
form
of
the
prescription
embodied
in
chapter
55
section
8
and
in
its
precursors
and
the
form
of
the
specific
challenge
that
of
judicial
challenge
had
eventuated
has
varied.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
sheer
speculation
that
suggests
that
if
a
first
amendment
argued
is
again
raised
and
if
the
legislature
or
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
again
puts
a
grad
tax
on
the
ballot,
if
corporations
again
want
to
oppose
it,
that
these
issues
will
arise
between
these
parties
that
there
will
be
the
same
issues
or
that
will
be
in
this
format.
furthermore
on
the
second
pattern
of
the
analysis,
the
record
amply
illustrates
that
this
case,
first
national
bank
versus
bellotti
did
not
arise
in
a
time
frame
social
at
the
complete
appellant
reviews
was
impossible.
the
appellants
could
have
brought
their
case
as
the
lower
court
noted
in
noted
in
note
15
of
its
opinion,
a
full
year
before
they
did
bring
their
case.
had
they
brought
their
case
reasonably
close
to
the
date
on
which
the
controversy
arose,
and
had
they
sought
and
obtained
expedited
review
in
light
of
the
impending
election,
the
appellants
clearly
could
have
obtained
plenary
consideration
by
this
court
within
the
available
time
frame.
their
delay
and
their
delay
only
is
the
reason
that
they
have
not
managed
to
obtain
complete
appellate
review
on
this
case.
under
these
circumstances
the
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
doctrine
is
in
the
opposite
and
the
case
has
become
moot.
turning
once
again
to
the
first
amendment
issues
that
have
been
raised,
the
commonwealth
asserts
three
basic
interests
which
we
think
justify
any
incidental
impact
that
this
statute
might
have
one
any
imagined
first
amendment
rights.
we
start
first
from
the
proposition
though
that
corporations
do
not
have
first
amendments
rights
per
se
that
they
are
not
natural
persons
and
that
they
may
be
restricted
to
protection
of
the
rights
that
are
contained
in
their
charters.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
inapplicable
to
these
appellants
because
they
are
artificial
entities.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
though,
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
first
amendment
rights
per
se
,
the
right
of
free
speech
per
se
attaches
to
business
corporations
whose
charters
do
not
relate
either
to
the
press,
the
communication
of
ideas
of
the
advancement
of
other
first
amendments
rights
or
in
the
alternative
unless
there
has
been
some
finding
of
a
business
interest.
the
business
corporations
are
simply
quite
different
from
natural
persons
and
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
held
that
they
do
not
exercise
other
purely
personal
rights
such
as
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
right
--
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
it
would
be
a
case
in
which
the
new
york
times
in
its
charter
or
it
is
part
of
its
business
was
involved
in
the
dissemination
of
news
that
was
involved
in
the
business
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
again,
the
protection
of
arguably
a
business
interest
like
the
commercial
speech
case.
i
would
assert
that
in
every
case
in
which
a
pure,
in
which
a
right
of
speech
has
been
found
that
there
is
either
a
business
interest
as
in
the
commercial
speech
cases
or
that
there
is
an
idea
of
dissemination
of
first
amendment,
i
guess.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
mr.
fox’
has
answered
the
court
was
--
it
is
as
and
i
believe
it
was
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
was
as
good
and
answers
could
be
provided.
there
are
no
cases
which
hold
directly
with
the
first
amendment
right
of
free
speech
per
se
applies
to
business
corporations
as
such.
that
the
issue
is,
this
is,
and
i
would
submit
a
fairly
unique
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
that
was
also
of
the
charter
of
the
new
york
times,
i
clearly
answered
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
the
reason
that
i
would
answer
yes
is
that,
when
an
individual
invests
his
money
in
a
corporation
like
the
new
york
times
or
which
or
like
the
boston
globe,
there
is
the
idea
that
his
money
will
be
utilized
in
the
dissemination
of
certain
ideas.
when
an
individual
invests
his
money
in
digital
corporation,
in
wyman-gordon
in
the
first
national
bank,
there
is
an
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
individual
that
his
funds,
that
the
corporation
will
exercise
its
best
efforts
to
protect
his
investment
and
to
enhance
his
investment.
and
that
to
the
extent
that,
political
contributions
and
political
messages,
not
his
views,
that
permitting
corporations
to
make
political
statements
is
an
opportunity
for
the
corporation
to
the
corporate
management
to
abuse
the
trust
placed
in
them
on
the
one
hand
and
at
best
and
at
worst
to
coerce
contributions
from
their
shareholders,
to
use
their
funds
for
purposes
which
are
inimical
to
their
own
constitutional
and
political
beliefs
and
i
think
that
that
is
antithetical
to
the
real
purpose
behind
the
first
amendment.
i
see
my
time
is
passing
and
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
get
to
assert
one
time
the
three
interests
that
we
say
the
state
has
in
restricting
speech
of
this
nature.
first,
we
think
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
referendum
and
issued
of
an
amendment
processes
as
the
people’s
quarrel.
second,
we
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
maintaining
even
in
preventing
even
the
appearance
of
impropriety
as
it
relates
to
that
process
and
by
that
i
mean
that
we
feel
we
have
the
right
to
remove
even
the
suggestion
of
a
domination
by
corporations
in
the
political
sphere.
that
is
not
an
imaginary
evil.
in
1972,
the
corporations,
many
corporations
bonded
together
and
spent
$120,000.00
to
oppose
the
graduated
income
tax
as
opposed
to
7,000
or
15,000
in
favor
by
the
proponents.
now
that
is
not
the
same
under
influence
argument
that
the
court,
in
mr.
fox’
view
laid
to
rest
in
buckley
and
valeo.
we
are
not
saying
that
that
an
individual
who
is
a
millionaire
cannot
use
his
funds
to
promote
his
political
beliefs
or
that
an
individual
who
is
talented
in
political
debate
cannot
use
his
talents
or
is
asserting
to
court
is
that,
the
state
has
a
right
of
keeping
corporations
which
do
not
belong
in
the
initiative
process
in
the
first
place
from
preventing
a
full
and
robust
debate
among
those
individuals
who
have
a
direct
interest
in
the
correct
answering
of
the
questions
before
the
court.
and
the
third
interest
that
we
assert
to
the
court,
is
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
minority
shareholders
of
these
individual
corporations.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
cort
versus
ash
has
not
said
that
protection
for
minority
shareholders
is
a
secondary
interest
at
best.
that
cort
and
ash
is
a
statutory
construction
case
in
which
this
court
did
not
find
the
existence
of
an
implied
civil
right
of
action
under
the
federal
election.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
would
suggest
only
that
perhaps
we
could
limit
their
expenditures
in
the
legislature
as
well
but,
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
correct.
and
in
fact
in
the
opinion
below,
mr.
justice
liakos
(ph)
has
indicated
that
in
his
view
of
protection
of
minority
interest
is
a
very
important
element
for
the
massachusetts
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
certainly.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
with
all
due
respect,
i
disagree.
mr.
thomas
r.
kiley
i
think
that
it
is
not.
i
think
that
no
reasonable
man
viewing
the
dialog
between
supreme
court
and
legislature
on
this
case
could
argue
that
this
statute
is
vague
indeed
mr.
fox
in
his
brief
concedes
that
this
proscription
was
tailor
made
to
apply
to
him.
i
would
submit
only,
that
the
language
that
mr.
justice
powell
read
prompts
on
page
19
has
to
be
read
in
context,
the
language
on
page
12
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
justice
liakos
(ph)
cites
to
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
talks
about
the
right
of
corporations
if
they
do
exist
and
where
they
stem
from.
