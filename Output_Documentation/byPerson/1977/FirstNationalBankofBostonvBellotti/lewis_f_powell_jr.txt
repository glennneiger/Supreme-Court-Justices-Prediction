justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
it
involves
the
right
of
corporation
to
express
that
views
on
issues
submitted
to
a
referendum
vote.
appellants
are
banks
and
business
corporations
doing
business
in
massachusetts.
a
state
statute
makes
it
illegal
for
a
bank
or
business
corporation
to
spend
money
in
favor
of
or
against
a
referendum
question,
the
only
exception
is
where
the
corporation
can
prove
that
the
issue
materially
affects
it's
business
or
property.
the
statute
also
expressly
provides
that
any
question
related
to
individual
income
taxes
shall
not
be
deemed
to
affect
materially
a
corporation's
business.
this
provision
was
added
to
prevent
corporation
from
taking
any
part
in
a
referendum
proposal
that
would
authorize
the
legislature
to
enact
a
graduated
personal
income
tax.
appellants
believing
such
attacks
would
have
an
adverse
economic
impact
upon
the
state
of
massachusetts,
challenged
the
statute.
the
massachusetts
court
rejected
the
challenge.
it
concluded
that
the
only
right
of
free
speech
enjoyed
by
corporations
is
incidental
to
the
protection
of
their
business
or
property.
the
court,
therefore,
sustained
the
validity
of
the
statute.
the
case
thus
presents
an
important
issue
as
to
the
speech
rights
of
corporations
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
although
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
speak
of
passage,
corporations,
both
private
and
municipal,
have
been
held
to
be
persons
under
this
provision
for
nearly
a
century.
the
court
has
repeatedly
sustained
the
speech
rights
of
corporations
engaged
in
the
media
business
and
more
recently
the
right
to
engage
in
commercial
advertising.
the
rationale
of
these
decisions
has
not
been
based
on
the
business
interest
of
the
corporations.
the
first
amendment's
primary
concern,
and
therefore,
the
court's
concern,
always
has
been
the
preservation
of
free
and
uninhibited
dissemination
of
information
and
ideas.
if
the
restrictive
view
of
corporate
speech
taken
by
the
massachusetts'
court
were
accepted,
government
would
have
the
power
to
deprive
society
of
the
views
of
corporations
on
all
issues
other
than
those
that
could
be
proved
to
affect
adversely
their
property
or
business
interest.
corporations
thus
could
be
prohibited
from
expressing
views
by
advertisements
or
otherwise
on
all
matters
of
general
public
interest.
we
view
the
massachusetts'
court's
decision
as
seriously
restricting
public
access
to
major
sources
of
ideas
and
educational
information.
no
state
interest
have
been
identified
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
this
restriction
on
corporate
speech
and
the
consequent
curtailment
of
information
available
to
the
public.
if
a
state
has
the
power
to
confine
business
corporate
speech
to
issues
found
by
a
court
to
affect
only
it's
business
or
property
of
particular
interest,
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
recognize
an
equal
power
to
curtail
the
speech
of
other
forms
of
organizations,
for
example,
non-profit
corporations,
massachusetts
trust,
associations,
and
labor
unions.
we
conclude
for
the
reasons
set
forth
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
that
the
massachusetts
statute
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
