chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
first
national
bank
against
bellotti.
mr.
fox,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
discussion,
would
you
be
good
enough
to,
if
you
know,
tell
us
the
status
of
the
proposed
amendments
to
the
statute
of
((inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
the
power
there
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
do
not
publish
a
news
paper,
they
might
publish
annual
reports
and
would
you
think
they
would
have
first
amendment
rights
in
their
annual
reports
for
their
stockholders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
corporation
could
be
required
to
get
the
consent
of
two-thirds
of
its
stockholders
before
it
engages
in
a
publishing
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
take
that
as
a
separate
requirement,
take
it
as
a
requirement
that
a
corporation
it
before
does
anything
as
to
get
to
vote
of
two-thirds
of
its
stockholders.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
any
difficulty
at
all
whether
requirement
or
corporation
before
it
engaged
in
any
corporate
act
obtained
that
it
is
consent
of
two-thirds
of
its
shareholders,
any
constitutional
difficulty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
surely
you
have
no
question
about
a
statute
that
said
in
massachusetts
there
will
be
no
corporations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
shareholders
could
not
impose
an
advance
obligations
that,
you
are
not
to
go
into
certain
activities
or
you
are
not
go
beyond
specific
activities
described
in
the
charter
without
getting
a
two-thirds
vote.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
in
effect
is
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
could
not
by
statute
place
this
hypothetical
law
as
a
condition
for
using
the
corporate
form
or
bank
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
they
could
abolish
the
user
corporations
totally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kiley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
bar
that
you
know
of,
the
officers
to
give
interviews
to
newspaperman
and
to
broadcasting
stations
about
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
kiley,
why
does
your
constitutional
position
limit
you
so
that
you
have
to
allow
a
corporation
to
spend
money
when
its
own
business
interests
are
materially
affected,
is
there
a
constitutional
right
of
self
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
were
a
first
amendment
case
strictly
speaking
and
in
the
federal
government,
you
would
not
be
dealing
with
any
question
of
whether
they
were
natural
persons
because
the
first
amendment
by
its
terms
does
not
require
that
it
would
be
a
person
that
takes
advantage
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
about
proposition
that
corporations
could
be
organized
in
such
a
way
that
after
the
declaration
of
corporate
purpose
would
be
a
statement
generally
and
to
engage
in
the
dissemination
of
information
and
knowledge
necessary
for
the
well
being
of
the
united
states
and
the
people
there
of,
that
gave
them
first
amendment
rights
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
new
york
times
charter
says
but
it
must
be
something
like
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
first
national
bank
of
boston
against
bellotti
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
justice
powell,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
blackmun
will
come
next.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
