justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
does
that
not
make
of
the
requirement
materiality
a
little
easier
to
fulfill
the
pending
legislation,
the
two-thirds
vote
of
the
stockholders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fox,
supposing
if
massachusetts
had
these
two
statutes
on
the
books,
one,
a
prohibition,
a
criminal
prohibition
against
the
director
who
violated
a
resolution
passed
by
a
majority
of
the
stockholders
at
the
last
meeting
and
spent
corporate
funds
in
violation
to
that
resolution.
and
then
supposing
that
one
of
the
corporations
in
this
suit,
at
its
last
stockholders
maybe
passed
a
resolution
saying,
“we
are
sick
and
tired
of
having
a
first
national
bank
of
boston’s
spend
money
opposing
this
income
tax”
and
we
adapt
a
resolution
saying
that
“no
more
money
like
that
shall
be
spent”.
now,
could
the
president
of
the
bank
be
prosecuted
criminally
under
that
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
criminal
statute
says
that
any
officer
of
a
corporation
who
spends
money
contrary
to
a
valid
resolution
of
the
stockholders
may
be
a
criminally
prosecuted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
you
think
that
the
president
of
the
bank
is
simply
on
his
own
so
to
speak
with
respect
to
the
stockholders,
if
he
figures
he
wants
to
communicate
something,
all
99%
of
the
stockholders
can
tell
him
“no”
and
he
still
got
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
massachusetts
cannot
punish
him
criminally
for
doing
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
state
of
massachusetts
cannot
adjust
that
balance
between
shareholders
and
directors
and
managers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
you
can
contribute
to
you
mean,
to
pay
lobbies.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
an
ironic
twist
here
is
it
not?
and
that
the
legislature
overwhelmingly
passed
the
income
tax
and
then
the
people
rejected
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
let
me
interrupt
you,
i
realize
you
haven't
fully
answered.
do
you,
do
you
think
that
the
incorporation
of
the
first
amendment
has
more
or
less
and
the
fourteenth
has
been
proceeded
by
a
bodily
incorporations
so
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
now
reads,
no
state
shall
abridge
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
it
is
religious,
not
political.
i
mean,
it
is
a
political
or
constitutional
question,
not
a
religious
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
it
is
not
the
position
the
court
has
taken
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
case
is
on
stronger
ground
if
you
say
that,
one
must
first
pass
through
the
person
loophole
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
if
you
say,
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
any
reference
to
any
of
its
language
says,
“no
state
shall
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
the
press”.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
which
position
do
you
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
which
position
do
you
take
with
the
respect
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
you
first
have
to
show
you
are
a
person
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
amendment?
