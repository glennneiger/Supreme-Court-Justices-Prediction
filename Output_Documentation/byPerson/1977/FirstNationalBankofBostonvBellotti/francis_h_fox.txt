mr.
francis
h.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
which
the
plaintiffs
contest
the
validity
of
chapter
55
section
eight
of
the
general
laws
which
forbids
corporations
from
expending
or
contributing
moneys
in
an
attempt
to
influence
the
vote
on
any
question,
referendum
question,
other
than
a
question
which
materially
affects
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
it
is
specifically
provided
that
no
question
which
relates
solely
to
individual
taxes
shall
be
deemed
materially
to
affect
the
corporate
assets.
in
november
1976,
there
was
on
a
ballot,
a
question
which
related
solely
to
individual
taxes
whether
the
constitution
should
be
amended
to
provide
for
graduated
income
taxes.
the
plaintiffs
wished
to
expend
or
contribute
moneys,
propose
that
referendum
question
by
means
of
media
ads
and
the
like.
they
did
not
do
so
because
of
the
severe
criminal
penalties
attendant
upon
violation
and
the
threat
of
prosecution.
the
plaintiffs
are
five
business
corporations
located
in
the
state
with
deep
and
pervasive
ties
to
the
economy.
for
example;
the
plaintiff
banks
have
on
loan
to
business
corporations
literally
billions
of
dollars.
the
plaintiffs
among
them
employ
between
20,000
and
25,000
people
in
the
state.
the
management
of
each
of
the
plaintiff
corporations
believed
that
the
interest
of
the
corporation
would
be
materially
affected
by
the
referendum
question.
in
various
ways
the
record
spells
out.
for
example,
the
plaintiff
banks
believed
that
if
the
graduated
tax
reviewed
does
one
more
anti-business
law
in
the
state
that
might
detract
from
other
businesses
from
locating
in
the
state
or
staying
in
the
state
and
thus
diminish
the
business
of
the
banks.
two
of
the
plaintiffs,
for
example;
employ
highly
skilled
and
thus
highly
paid
engineers,
they
must
compete
with
other
states
to
attract
these
engineers
to
the
state,
they
felt
that
a
graduated
income
tax
might
make
it
more
difficult
to
attract
these
kinds
of
people.
in
any
event,
the
management
of
each
of
the
plaintiffs
did
believe,
the
record
finds,
that
the
graduated
tax
would
affect
the
business
of
the
corporations.
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
however,
it
seems
there
was
no
finding
that
in
fact,
the
graduated
tax
would
affect
the
interests
of
the
plaintiffs,
and
they
were
without
first
amendment
protection
for
their
prospective
speech
here.
the
supreme
judicial
court
upheld
the
statute.
plaintiffs
appeal,
as
today
we
appeal
arguing
first
amendment,
due
process
and
that
the
statute
makes
use
of
a
presumption
yet
as
a
criminal
statute.
also
the
underlying
standard
itself
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
materially
affecting
the
assets
and
equal
protection
and
that
a
single
ballot
question
is
singled
out
for
an
absolute
prohibition
as
to
expenditures
or
contributions
or
as
any
other
kind
of
a
ballot
question
has
a
different
standard
applied,
one
of
materially
affecting
the
assets.
also
on
equal
protection,
the
fact
that
business
corporations
are
the
only
entities
that
are
regulated
by
section
eight
from
top
to
bottom,
section
eight
regulates
only
business
corporations,
not
partnerships,
charitable
corporations
or
other
entities
similarly
situated.
today,
i
will
address
the
mootness
question.
the
election
is
over,
and
the
grad
tax
did
--
.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
the
massachusetts
slot
does
not
restrict
charitable
corporations
in
any
kind
of
a
ballot
question
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
they
can.
on
page
46
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
there
is
listed
a
number
of
organizations
which
have
advocated
a
graduated
income
tax
in
the
past.
these
are
the
americans
for
democratic
action,
council
of
churches,
this
kind
of
a
listing
and
whether
they
would
run
into
tax
problems
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
all
are.
i
do
not
know,
i
think
some
of
them
maybe,
some
of
them
may
not
be.
my
purpose
in
listing
them
or
referring
to
them
is
just
on
the
mootness
question,
your
honor
to
indicate
that
it
is
likely
to
come
back
again.
i
can
say
this.
charitable
corporations
are
not
forbidden
from
contributing
or
expending
as
to
referendum
questions
in
massachusetts,
whether
tax
considerations
would
indicate
they
did
not
do
it,
i
do
not
know.
i
will
address
mootness,
first
amendment
and
equal
protection
arguments
this
morning
or
this
afternoon
and
rely
on
my
brief
for
the
other
points.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes,
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
bill
that
is
still
pending
in
the
legislature
that
combine
13
separate
bills
that
were
introduced
and
an
advisory
opinion
was
requested,
the
supreme
judicial
court
declined
to
answer
the
questions.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
they
have
the
power
to
but
they
declined
to
for
the
very
reason
that
this
case
is
pending
and
the
bill
is
winding
its
way
through
the
legislative
process,
i
have
no
idea
whether
or
pass
or
not.
i
know
it
has
not
has
yet
passed.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
bill
would
amend
chapter
55
section
eight
and
other
material
respects
too,
it
would
not
touch
the
graduated
income
tax
prohibition
or
the
materially
affecting
standard
but
it
would
put
a
thousand
dollar
limit
on
the
amount
that
corporations
could
contribute
to
any
question
if
they
are
materially
affected.
it
would
require
that
committees
not
to
take
more
than
a
thousand
dollars,
it
would
forbid
outside
of
the
state
corporations
for
making
any
contributions.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
i
look
at
that
as
an
additional
requirement,
if
it
is
material
you
must
get
two-thirds
vote
and
you
must
meet
the
material
affecting
standard
as
well
and
you
can
only
spend
a
thousand.
and
with
the
public
corporation,
your
honor,
that
might
mean
that
to
get
two-thirds
vote,
they
might
have
to
spend
five
or
six
thousand
dollars
to
get
the
privilege
to
expend
$1,000.00
if
it
is
materially
affecting.
those
amendments
are
not
before
the
court
except
by
way
of
perhaps
relevance
on
the
mootness
question,
i
think
they
are
not
really
relevant
on
that
either.
the
election
is
over
but
the
case
is
not
moot
because
it
comes
within
the
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
principle
which
is
enunciated
for
non-class
actions
and
weinstein
versus
bradford
requires,
there
would
be
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
same
offending
order
will
affect
the
same
plaintiffs
in
the
future
and
that
the
time
within
which
to
seek
full
review
will
be
too
limited
to
allow
it.
in
an
analysis
with
respect
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
would
require
a
reasonable
expectation
that
there
will
be
a
grad
tax
on
the
ballot
in
the
future,
that
the
prohibitory
legislation
will
remain
intact.
that
that
prohibition
will
affect
these
plaintiffs
in
the
future
and
that
the
timing
will
preclude
review.
looking
at
the
first
question,
will
there
be
a
graduated
tax
on
the
ballot
in
the
future?
i
would
point
out
that
four
times
in
the
last
14
years
of
legislature
has
put
this
question
on
a
ballot
for
the
people.
each
time
they
have
done
so
by
overwhelming
votes,
votes
in
the
order
of
200:40,
this
kind
of
thing.
the
statistics
appear
at
the
footnote
five
of
our
brief.
the
legislature
obviously
feels
certain
financial
pressures.
this
and
every
other
state
legislature,
there
seems
to
be
no
abatement
in
those
financial
pressures.
thirty-six
out
of
the
fifty
states
do
have
graduated
taxes.
there
are
public
interest
groups
that
advocate
and
have
advocated
a
graduated
income
tax
as
being
necessary.
while
it
is
not
mathematically
certain
what
will
happen
in
the
future,
i
think
there
is
a
reason
of
expectation
that
would
nothing
to
lose,
the
legislature
will
once
again
put
this
question
on
the
ballot
to
enable
itself
to
get
a
more
efficient
taxing
vehicle.
will
the
prohibitory
statute
remain
intact?
the
efforts
of
the
legislature
to
put
this
question
before
the
people
have
been
matched
in
that
14
years
span,
by
efforts
to
arrive
at
the
right
statutory
formula
that
will
completely
preclude
corporate
spending
in
the
campaign.
earlier
versions
of
the
prohibition
led
to
narrowing
court
constructions
which
allowed
corporations
to
contribute,
having
now
arrived
at
a
complete
and
out
of
ban
as
to
any
corporate
contributions
or
expenditures,
it
is
unlikely
in
the
extreme
that
the
legislature
will
soften
or
eliminate
that
ban.
as
i
have
indicated
they
may
indeed
expand
the
concept
to
make
it
more
difficult
as
to
other
questions
but
the
likelihood
that
they
will
change
this
absolute
prohibition
is
remote.
will
these
plaintiffs
be
affected
in
the
future?
well,
the
record
of
their
opposition
is
a
strong
one,
they
contributed
to
oppose
the
grad
tax
in
1972.
three
of
them
brought
the
case
that
gave
the
corporations
the
right
to
do
so.
they
brought
this
case
in
1976,
they
appeal
the
decision
even
after
the
election
is
over
in
order
to
be
able
to
win
the
right
to
contribute
or
expend
in
the
future.
they
remain
unalterably
opposed
to
a
graduated
income
tax
and
will
oppose
it
whenever
and
wherever
it
comes
up.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
certainly
hope
so
your
honor,
they
owe
me
some
money.
the
opposition
of
the
plaintiffs
will
not
seize,
i
think.
as
far
as
the
timing
is
concerned,
i
rely
primarily
on
my
brief
to
point
out
and
in
the
reply
brief
we
point
out
some
of
the
scheduling
and
so
forth
that
would
be
encountered
by
any
kind
of
a
test
case.
this
time,
the
maximum
time
that
we
could
have
had
that
test
that
was
18
months,
every
time
it
has
been
on
the
ballot,
which
is
four
times,
there
has
been
no
time
when
more
than
18
months
was
available.
there
is
no
likelihood
that
there
will
be
more
than
18
months
at
anytime
in
the
future.
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
that
for
instance
two
years
is
really
short
of
time
to
enable
a
full
proceeding
below
and
a
full
review
by
this
court.
southern
pacific
terminal,
the
case
which
first
enunciated
the
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
principle
involved
a
two
year
order
of
the
icc.
numerous
election
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
after
the
election
is
over,
involved
biennial
or
quadrennial
elections
wherein
probably
two,
three
or
four
years
would
have
been
available,
just
two
further
points
on
mootness.
it
is
an
election
case,
it
is
vital
that
these
procedures
be
straightened
out
before
the
election.
it
is
a
first
amendment
case,
there
is
a
statute
on
the
books
that
prohibits
speech
and
does
nebraska
press
versus
stuart
and
other
case
has
indicate,
it
is
also
very
important
that
these
matters
be
straightened
out.
going
on
to
the
first
amendment
portion
of
the
argument
here,
there
are
numerous
first
amendment
issues,
i
would
say
numerous
first
amendment
errors.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no.
not
a
square
holding
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
not
the
square
holding
--.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
right,
i
would
rather
say
that
whatever
positions
or
opinions
the
corporation
may
have
must
really
be
those
of
some
individuals
who
are
acting
in
their
representational
capacity,
yes.
i
would
say
that
the
linmark
associates
case
your
honor,
which
did
involve
a
corporate
plaintiff
and
entailed
a
first
amendment
holding
is
evidence
in
that
regard.
the
virginia
pharmacy
case
i
think
could
not
possibly
be
applied
to
eliminate
corporations
from
the
ability
to
advertise
drug
prizes.
i
was
about
to
suggest
that
while
the
court
below
said
that
is
the
first
question
we
must
decide,
i
think
that
that
is
not
so.
the
court
below
construed
section
eight
as
creating
two
separate
crimes.
one
is
the
crime
of
contributing
or
expending
to
influence
the
vote
on
a
referendum
question,
other
than
one
that
materially
affects
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
the
other
is
the
crime
of
contributing
or
expending
with
respect
to
a
referendum
question
pertaining
solely
to
individual
taxes
without
regard
to
whether
that
affects
the
corporate
assets
or
not
and
the
court
is
very
specific
in
that
regard.
under
this
so
called
second
crime,
what
must
be
shown
by
the
prosecution
to
convict
is
that
a
contribution
is
made
in
an
attempt
to
influence
the
vote
on
a
matter
pertaining
solely
to
individual
taxes
period.
it
is
no
part
of
the
prosecutions
task
to
show
non-materiality
to
corporate
purpose.
the
court
below
construed
the
first
amendment,
constitution
not
a
statutory
construction
here
but
constitutional
law
has
allowing
a
corporation
to
have
first
amendment
right,
if
it
proved
the
affirmative
of
a
very
complicated
economic
principle,
namely
that
although
the
referendum
question
relates
solely
to
individual
taxes,
it
does
in
fact
materially
affect
the
corporation.
the
court
held
that
if
corporation
wished
to
prove
that
then
it
would
be
afforded
first
amendment
protection
for
its
speech.
we
say
that
the
analysis
is
inappropriate,
we
say
that
the
analysis
should
be
as
follows:
money
is
speech,
and
speech
is
protected
unless
and
until
it
comes
up
against
a
compelling
state
purpose
and
carefully
drafted
legislation
which
serves
that
purpose
in
the
least
restrictive
manner
available.
in
other
words,
the
prohibition
should
be
made
to
justify
itself,
the
focus
should
be
on
the
prohibition,
the
corporate
speaker
should
not
be
made
to
justify
his
prospective
speech.
if
one
shifts
to
focus
from
the
corporation
and
the
court
below
went
to
an
artificial,
i
think,
analysis
of
the
rights
of
corporations,
their
nature,
whether
consistent
with
their
existence
and
so
forth,
if
one
takes
the
focus
from
that
and
scrutinizes
the
prohibition
here,
one
will
find
that
there
is
not
compelling
interest
served
by
this
prohibition
and
if
there
is
any
purpose
served,
it
is
not
done
in
the
least
restrictive
way.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
state
allows
the
creation
and
existence
of
an
entity
capable
of
communication
it
cannot
squelch
that
communication
without
running
into
serious
problems
under
the
first
amendment.
ultra
virus
is
a
possible
concern
of
the
state
but
it
is
not
served
by
this
statute
here
which
prohibits
only
expenditure
as
to
one
kind
of
a
political
question,
question
relating
to
individual
taxes.
every
other
kind
of
a
question,
the
relation
to
the
corporate
purpose
has
a
different
standard
applied
to
it
but
here
you
cannot
contribute
or
expend
whether
it
is
in
your
articles
of
organization,
whether
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
your
purpose
at
all
if
it
relates
to
an
individual
tax.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
would
say
so
yes
your
honor.
i
would
say
the
state
could
go
to
that
corporation
or
a
stockholder
could
go
to
the
corporation.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
you
mean
a
statute
saying
that
any
corporation
wishing
to
communicate
or
publish
should
first
get
the
vote
of
2/3s.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
would
have
less
difficulty
with
the
statute
that
says
a
corporation
before
it
does
anything
must
get
to
two-thirds
approval.
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says
if
you
are
going
to
do
some
communicating,
some
publishing
you
must
get
two-thirds
approval.
i
think
there
must
be
a
compelling
purpose
found
behind
that
and
whatever
it
is
you
must
examine
it
to
see
if
there
is
a
less
restrictive
way
of
serving
that
purpose.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
would
have
difficulty
with
it
and
that
it
seems
to
me
the
primary
emphasis
on
the
first
amendment
is
in
the
right
of
the
hear
it
to
listen,
the
right
of
the
public
to
hear
and
if
you
are
going
to
restrict
that,
it
should
only
be
to
serve
a
very
compelling
purpose
and
this
would
restrict
it
in
some
way
because
getting
two-thirds
vote
may
be
a
very
difficult
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
i
would
not
have
any
problem
with
that.
if
they
said
publishers
may
not
incorporate,
i
would
have
problems
with
them.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well
ultra
vires
as
a
civil
remedy
is
available
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
for
shareholders
to
keep
their
corporations
on
the
track
what
i
had
trouble
with
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well
for
the
criminal
law
to
prohibit
a
communication,
i
think
it
is
possible
for
the
criminal
law
to
do
so.
i
am
just
saying
there
must
be
one
whole
of
a
public
purpose
served
that
before
this
court
would
allow
that
to
occur.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
of
course
we
are
attacking
the
second
sentence
primarily
which
says
you
cannot
contribute
or
expend
as
to
a
referendum
question
relating
to
taxes.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well,
i
think
that
that
is,
if
the
purpose
is
ultra
vires
or
to
protect
the
corporate
shareholder,
it
is
an
irrational
device
to
serve
that
because
it
is
not
logical
to
assume
that
the
only
way
in
which
corporate
management
could
commit
ways
or
commit
acts
of
ultra
vires
is
with
respect
to
a
referendum
question
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
that
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
have
to
identify
the
purpose
served
if
it
is
an
ultra
vires
purpose,
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
shareholders
that
it
is
assumed
that
a
communication
on
individual
taxes
is
corporate
waste.
i
guess
i
would
say
that
that
would
violate
equal
protection
under
the
moseley
principle
where
the
state
of
illinois
cannot
presume
that
non-labor
picketing
is
more
violent
than
labor
picketing
and
so
forth.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
it
is
not
part
of
my
purpose
to
attack
that.
as
a
personal
opinion,
i
think
perhaps,
it
would
be
difficult.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no,
here
is
why.
the
purpose
served
by
the
federal
statute
is
to
avoid
the
fact
or
appearance
of
corruption.
a
candidate
repaying
his
heavy
contributives,
out
of
the
public
trust
after
he
is
elected
is
as
this
court
held
in
buckley
and
valeo,
a
very
high
purpose.
there
is
no
equivalent
purpose
in
a
candidate
or
a
campaign
relating
to
referendum
questions.
the
prospect
of
corruption
is
non-existent,
no
one
gets
elected,
there
are
no
political
debts
created.
every
court
that
has
construed
this
kind
of
questions
since
buckley
and
there
are
four
of
them
and
they
are
on
page
41
of
our
brief
has
so
held
your
honor,
so
that
i
would
say
that
the
federal
corrupt
practices
act
serves
the
compelling
purpose.
whether
it
is
necessary
to
restrict
corporations
to
an
absolute
prohibition
is
a
different
question,
even
whether
that
federal
statute
is
serving
in
it
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
there
could
be
circumstances
where
a
particular
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
but
see
the
portions
of
the
statutes
dealing
with
candidates
and
this
is
a
highly
regulated
area
at
least
in
massachusetts,
could
get
indirect
methods
as
well
as
direct.
but
in
this
record
there
is
absolutely
no
connection
with
a
candidate
or
many
part
of
some
political
issue.
as
far
as
compelling
purposes,
corruption
cannot
be
one
because
there
is
no
any
likelihood
of
corruption.
avoiding
undue
influence
of
wealth
is
a
purpose
laid
to
rest
by
this
court
and
buckley
versus
valeo
where
the
court
said
that
the
concept,
that
one
element
of
society
may
have
its
speech
restricted
in
order
to
enhance
the
relative
voice
of
another
element
of
society’s
contrary
alien
to
the
first
amendment.
the
purpose
of
serving
the
shareholders
interest
who
does
not
want
to
see
his
corporation
take
a
political
position.
it
has
been
recognized
by
cort
v.
ash
in
this
court
to
be
a
secondary
purpose
at
best
as
far
as
corporate
shareholders
are
concerned
as
distinguished
from
labor
unions,
where
you
might
have
compulsory
union
membership,
you
might
have
compulsory
dues
and
union
membership
may
be
a
precondition
to
employment.
here,
labor
unions
are
not
regulated
in
the
least,
but
as
far
as
a
corporate
shareholder
is
concerned,
this
purpose
is
definitely
secondary
and
it
is
ill
served
by
a
statute
which
expresses
that
concern
only
as
to
one
and
one
only
of
the
infinite
number
of
referendum
questions
that
may
come
up.
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
the
equal
protection
portion
of
it,
before
i
do
go
on
to
that,
if
this
court
is
satisfied
that
the
second
sentence
of
the
statute
which
prohibits
expenditures
as
to
a
particular
question
is
unconstitutional,
i
do
not
think
the
court
need
draw
a
line
around
what
is
ultimately
going
to
be
first
amendment
corporation
free
speech.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
facts
set
forth
between
pages
15
and
27
of
our
appendix
here
and
rule
that
on
these
facts,
a
corporation
may
not
constitutionally
be
squelched
from
whatever
communication
it
wishes
to
make
regardless
of
the
statute.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
they
could
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
state
cannot
attach
on
constitutional
conditions
to
the
grant
of
any
privilege
and
if
the
state
wished
to
serve
the
purpose
of
keeping
corporations
close
to
the
track
of
their
own
business,
perhaps
a
purpose
could
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well
i
think
there
would
be
equal
protection
problems.
if
the
incorporated
form
is
a
valuable
form
and
is
very
meritorious
to
restrict
it
to
one
kind
of
business
or
one
element
of
society
probably
would
be
an
equal
protection
violation,
not
maybe
a
first
amendment.
what
i
would
say
is
the
state
could
come
in
and
say
“mr.
corporation,
you
should
not
be
running
newspapers,
you
should
be
selling
shoes”,
and
maybe
get
them
in
trouble
as
far
as
the
selling
shoes
is
concerned
but
they
could
not
shut
down
the
process.
once
you
are
going
to
communicate,
the
first
amendment
is
going
to
protect
that
communication.
if
the
shareholders
want
to
bring
the
proceedings
civilly
to
assure
that
this
is
something
has
changed
may
be
so
criminal
law
should
not
do
it.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
that
the
shareholders
could
do
that
your
honor.
if
the
shareholders
were
to
hold
the
corporation
to
its
purpose,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
purpose
gets
off
into
communication,
then
there
must
be
constitutionally,
a
discretionary
factor
in
management,
as
to
whatever
it
is
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose
of
the
shareholders
have
set
forth
in
the
articles
of
organization.
otherwise,
you
would
have
management
avoiding
communications
and
there
would
be
a
chilling
effect.
the
two-thirds
approval,
if
it
applied
across
the
board
to
all
corporate
activities,
i
would
have
no
particular
problem
with
it,
applying
it
to
communication
activities
only,
i
would
have
problems
applying
it
to
one
question
of
a
number
of
political
questions;
i
have
even
greater
problems,
thank
you.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
as
i
understood
your
hypothesis,
the
source
was
a
resolution
of
the
corporation
not
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
yes
and
if
the
form
in
which
the
expenditure
took
place
was
communicative
form
that
would
--
i
see
a
problem
with
the
first
amendment.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
well.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
the
corporation
--
it
is
clear
that
the
president
of
the
corporation
can
speak
his
own
mind
and
that
is
not
even
an
issue
here.
whether
he
can
take
out
an
ad
in
the
paper
using
corporate
funds,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
shareholders
would
go
no
further
than
finding
whether
that
is
necessary,
reasonably
necessary
to
make
a
profit.
if
to
make
a
profit,
the
corporate
managers
determine
that
it
is
necessary
to
think
a
political
stand
and
they
take
it,
then
it
would
seem
to
me,
the
individual
shareholder
would
have
no
particular
cause
for
concern.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
could
but
my
point
would
be
this,
if
they
are
going
to
back
whatever
the
shareholders
right
might
be
with
the
criminal
process,
i
think
they
would
have
to
have
an
element
of
discretion
vested
in
management
to
make
the
judgment
call
as
to
whether
the
particular
expenditure
is
related
to
the
business
purpose
or
not
because
otherwise,
you
would
have
corporate
managers
fearful
of
making
any
communicative
act,
whatsoever
less
they
go
to
jail.
now,
this
case
here
does
not
involve
any
shareholder
rights.
the
massachusetts
court
in
lustwerk
indicated
that
ultra
vires
is
available
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
that
is
a
1962
case
but
it
held,
i
think
the
holding
is
that
the
decision
on
corporate
managements
part
must
be
a
reasonable
one,
and
if
it
is
you
cannot
nudge
it.
if
the
state
wanted
to
come
in
and
be
beef
that
up
with
criminal
penalties,
i
think
the
only
way
they
could
it
would
be
to
give
a
wide
area
within
which
management
could
make
a
decision
that
somebody
might
second
guess
later,
but
the
first
amendment
would
not
allow
a
jury,
the
second
guess
management’s
decision
and
put
him
in
jail
if
it
is
arguably
close
to
the
corporate
purpose.
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
think
that
is
true
your
honor.
that
if
it
is
--
mr.
francis
h.
fox
i
would
think
so.
to
disallow
corporate
form
to
be
used
where
it
communicates
ideas
would
be
unconstitutional
under
equal
protection
in
its
intersection
with
the
first
amendment
and
i
would
have
no
doubt
on
this.
