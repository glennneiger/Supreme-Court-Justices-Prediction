mr.
jay
d.
geck
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
more
than
400,000
sites
across
the
country
that
are
contaminated
by
hazardous
wastes.
the
amici
states
recognize
that
if
these
sites
are
to
be
cleaned
up,
it's
going
to
take
the
work
of
private
parties.
in
turn,
we
recognize
that
private
parties
rely
upon
cost
recovery
to
obtain
their
costs
and
financial
incentives
to
do
the
site
cleanup.
the
united
states
argument
ignores
this
vast
majority
of
sites
that
do
not
have
the
opportunity
of
litigation
and
do
not
have
the
opportunity
of
settlement.
i'll
turn
first
to
the
words
"any
other
person"
where
the
united
states
argues
that
it
means
innocent
person.
the
words
107
of
cercla.
to
get
there,
the
united
states
borrows
from
other
sections
of
cercla.
if
the
word
other
were
superfluous...
and
we
do
not
think
it
is,
we
do
not
think
that's
the
right
reading...
the
better
textual
reading
here
is
the
natural
reading
of
section
107.
these
are
two
sections
that
are
practically
twins
and
if
words
are
known
by
the
company
they
keep,
you
have
three
parallel
structures
in
each
of
these
cost
recovery
sections.
and
further,
we
point
out
that
the
government's
argument
leads
to
an
implausible
result.
if
people
have
to
prove
their
innocence
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
cost
recovery
claim,
then
there
would
be,
indeed,
a
possible
multiyear
trial
just
in
order
to
decide
whether
they
had
a
right
to
cost
recovery.
a
far
better
approach
would
be
not
to
destroy
a
cost
recovery
claim
after
that
work
but
to
allow
those
issues,
that
is
a
plaintiff's
potential
liability
under
107,
to
be
raised
as
a
contribution
counterclaim.
and
that
way
you
have
an
incentive
for
settlement
between
that
private
plaintiff
and
the
defendants,
and
that
way
you
have
equity
being
done.
mr.
jay
d.
geck
the
states
recognize
that
to
proceed
under
settlement
puts
a
near
impossible
task.
epa,
of
course,
can
settle
very
few
sites,
they
have
limited
resources,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
don't
have
settlements
in
many
cases.
and
apparently
they
sometimes
have
disincentives
for
proceeding
with
a
settlement
because
it
would
open
the
government
to
a
contribution
claim.
the
states
also
have
similar
resource
limits.
the
states
in
order
to
go
into
a
settlement,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
the
government
is
blurring
the
state
settlement
right
here.
it's
referring
to
a
cost
recovery
right
which
the
states
could
seek
under
section
107
of
cercla,
but
there's
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
whether
a
state
settlement
that
orders
a
cleanup
would
be
a
resolution
of
cercla
liability,
and
a
second
circuit
case
from
con
edison
that's
pending
before
this
court
discusses
that
at
length.
uncertainty
does
not
drive
settlement.
you
asked
a
question,
justice
scalia,
about
other
reasons
why
there
are
incentives
for
settlement,
and
i'd
point
out
a
third,
fourth
and
fifth
one.
one,
you
do
get
to
settle
your
claims
that
the
government
is
bringing
against
you,
which
is
a
powerful
incentive
to
settle,
to
have
peace
with
the
government
in
certainty.
and
then
a
further
point
is
that
you
get
no
better
remedy
necessarily.
there
is
no
reason
to
walk
away
from
the
settlement
with
the
government,
and
i
don't
believe
the
government
can
point
to
any
examples
where
people
have
walked
away
from
settlements
in
order
to
pursue
107
claims,
because
107
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
a
windfall.
if
you're
a
liable
person
or
potentially
liable
person,
you're
going
to
see
your
defendants
raise
your
liability
and
they
are
going
to
interpose
a
cross-claim
under
section
113.
and
finally--
mr.
jay
d.
geck
--i
would
rely
first
on
the
textual
basis,
that
any
person
can
bring
a
cost
recovery
claim.
and
then
the
text
in
section
113(f)(1)
says
that
any
person
sued
under
section
107
may
bring
their
contribution
claim
against
any
other
person.
that
would
naturally
include
even
the
plaintiff
in
that
claim.
mr.
jay
d.
geck
the
fifth
sentence
of
(f)(1)
is
what
i
was
referring
to.
any
person
may
seek
contribution
from...
and
this
is
at
67a
of
the
petition,
and
i
believe
it's
9a
or
11a
of
the
u.s.
brief...
any
person
may
seek
contribution
from
any
other
person
who
is
liable
or
potentially
liable
under
section
107
during
or
following
the
107
action.
a
113
action
supplements
the
107
action
that
the
government
is
so
concerned
about.
turning
then
to
the
question
that
this
would
bypass
contribution
protection:
as
a
threshold
matter,
that
is
an
issue
that
is
rooted
in
the
language
of
section
113(f)(2).
it
is
not
a
signal
as
to
how
to
interpret
section
107
itself,
because
there
are
a
host
of
potential
107
actions
that
might
come
to
bear
that
the
united
states
admits
to
and
those
actions
could
equally
be
posed.
but
more
importantly
perhaps
is
that
because
any
person
who
does
a
settlement
with
the
government
would
raise
their
settlement
either
as
a
defense
or
as
a
counterclaim,
as
my
colleague
said,
the
court
would
have
the
authority
under
113(f)(1),
the
third
sentence,
there
to
allocate
and
apportion
responsibility
among
all
liable
persons.
and
at
that
point,
if
it
had
been
a
judicial
settlement
that
would
be
very
strong
evidence
that
you
had
paid
your
proportionate
share
to
the
site.
furthermore,
what
the
government
is
overlooking
is
the
settlements,
there
are
a
number
of
checks
and
balances
on
settlements.
this
is
not
a
real
world
problem
that
the
government
describing.
the
matters
addressed,
provision
of
the
settlement
that
the
epa
very
carefully
crafts,
doesn't
overreach.
occasionally
it
will,
but
when
it
does
address
an
entire
cleanup
at
a
site
that
signals
that
the
epa
is
going
to
be
in
control
of
the
cleanup
for
the
remainder
of
the
site
and
you're
not
going
to
have
unknown
parties
coming
in
and
entering
a
site.
to
do
so
would
be
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
national
contingency
plan
and
you
would
never
make
the
elements
of
proving
consistency
with
the
national
contingency
plan
in
triggering
a
107
right.
mr.
jay
d.
geck
well,
it
clearly
indicates
that
there
is
a
savings
for
other
contribution
rights
that
may
exist
under
other
areas
of
law.
mr.
jay
d.
geck
state
law
is
certainly
a
possibility
there
and
that
would
of
course
be
a
stronger
indicator
that
you
could
give
a
broader
reading
to
contribution
protection
under
(f)(2)
and
that's
what
several
courts
have
done.
but
the
scope
of
whether
a
state
law
meets
contribution
protection
has
been
debated
in
the
courts
and
it's
of
course
not
before
us
today.
in
the
end,
the
last
and
most
important
point
is
that
the
government's
construction
not
only
bars
cost
recovery
from
potentially
liable
persons
even
an
innocent
person
who
reads
section
107
would
not
step
forward.
if
you
touch
a
site
and
you
begin
operating
and
moving
waste...
and
mr.
chief
justice,
your
hypothetical
about
a
do-gooder
organization
that
might
come
in
and
do
cleanups.
there
is
a
good
likelihood
that
they
would
be
receiving
a
counterclaim
that
would
say
that
they
had
operated
the
site
and
become
a
liable
party.
and
that
could
litigate
for
years.
so
in
the
end,
in
the
end
of
the
case,
the
united
states
leaves
no
incentive
for
private
cost
recovery
and
there
are
400,000
sites
that
do
need
cleanup,
and
congress
did
contemplate
there
would
be
two
cause
of
actions,
one
under
107
for
cost
recovery
when
people
had
incurred
costs,
and
the
other
one
would
be
for
contribution
when
people
had
been
sued
or
had
settled
their
civil
suit
liability.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
