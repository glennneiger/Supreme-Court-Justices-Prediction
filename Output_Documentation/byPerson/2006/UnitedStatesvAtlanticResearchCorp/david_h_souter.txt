who
were
the
prps,
or
who
are
the
individuals
other
than
prps
who
are
likely
to,
to
avail
themselves
to
the
cause
of
action
under
section
7?
that's
one
of
the
problems
i
have.
i
mean,
it's
got
to
be
someone
other
than
owners
of
the
land
now,
owners
of
the
land
then.
i
mean,
who's
going
to
bring
these
actions?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
can
you
give
me
an
idea
of
generally--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
not...
you
know,
that's
not
a
private
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
quotation.
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
the
united
states
of
america,
but
we
wouldn't
normally
refer
to
it
as
a
private
party.
and...
but
i
don't
mean
to
get
tied
up
in
that,
but
can
you
think
of
any
individuals
or
corporations
who
are
not
likely
to
come
in
to
one
of
the
four
categories
in
7
who
would,
who
would
take
advantage
of
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
i
realize
that.
i'm
trying
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
those
are
people
who
would
have
a
defense
under
the
later
sections
of...
subsections
of
section
7.
they
are
still
people
who
would
fall
within
the
first
four
categories.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
know
that
when
they
go
into
court.
let's
assume
they
bring
the
action
and
the
answer
is
well,
you
fall
into
one
of
the
categories
one
through
four,
and
the
person
says
oh,
but
i...
i'm
not
liable
because
ultimately
i
will
have
an
innocent
party
defense.
would
we
then
have
a
collateral
trial
on
the
innocent
party
defense
in...
in
the
cause
of
action
for,
for
reimbursement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean
if
that
would
be
the
first
issue,
we'd
have
to
try
the
innocence
of
the
person
who
was
bringing
the
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
the...
the
trouble
with
having,
i
mean
the
trouble
with
that
approach
is
that
whatever
you,
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
effect
of
subsection
(b)
is
referred
to
as
defenses.
and
the
way
you're
using
it
the
so-called
defenses
would
be
an...
an
affirmative
element
in
the
action
for,
for,
for
cost
reimbursement
with
is
just...
and
i
mean
it
certainly
at
the
least
would
involve
a
very
odd
language
usage
in
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the...
what
about
the
statement
in
the
red
brief
that...
that
there
is
presently
in
existence
a
directive
that
epa
not
proceed
against
any
federal
agency?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me.
are
cases
that
you
referred
to
cases
in
which
epa
has
gone
against
a...
we'll
say
a
third
party
polluter,
but
the
government
is
also
involved?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
has
epa
during
the
pendency
of
that
directive
gone
directly
against
any
federal
agency?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if,
what
if
one
of
the
prps
they
so
identify
is
the
department
of
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
have
to
get
the
attorney
general's
approval
before
doing
that?
before
naming
the
department
of
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
however
they
initiate,
i
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
procedure
how
they
initiate
enforcement
action--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
by
that
letter--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
they
need
the
attorney
general's
approval
to
send
the
letter?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if,
what
the
department
of
defense
says
"nothing
doing"?
what
does
epa
do
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
does
it
do
about
the
department
of
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
my
hypo,
the
department
of
defense
says
you
know,
we
are
not
talking
with
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
does.
but
let's
just
talk
about
epa.
what
does
epa
do
in
the
case
that,
when
defense
stonewalls?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
at
that
point
113
would
kick
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--regardless
of
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
in
response
to
your...
going
back
to
your
response
to
justice
breyer,
i
take
it
the...
the
right
under...
under
107
was
affected
to
the
extent,
or
at
least
you
would
agree
that
it
was
affected
to
the
extent
that
if
there
is
a
settlement
they
are
home
free
and
there
can't
be
a
107
action;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
it
disturbed
the
old
scheme
to
that
extent.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
thing
they
would
need
the
attorney
general's
approval
for
would
be
institution
of
suit?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
they
institute
suit?
