mr.
hungar,
was
this
court
wrong
in
your
view,
it
wasn't
dispositive
of
the
case
in
key
tronic
when
it
said,
"section
107
unquestionably
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
private
parties
to
seek
recovery
of
cleanup
costs?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
think
that
when
the
court
says
this,
it
didn't
contemplate
that
prps
would
be
included
among
private
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
with
"or
a
state"
because
i
thought
that
there
was
some
suggestion
that
states,
they
don't
want
to
bother
with
the
federal
legislation,
so
they'll
say
you're
okay
under
the
state
legislation.
you
can't
force
a
state
to...
to
take
on
that
responsibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
states,
we
have
a
brief
from
the
states
telling
us
look,
we
don't
want
to
put
our
money
on
that
kind
of
thing.
we've
got
very
high-risk
sites
and
we
want
to
spend
our
resources
making
sure
those
are
cleaned
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they...
they
can.
of
course
they
can
but
the
states
are
telling
us
that
this
puts
a
burden
on
them
that
they
don't
want.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
just
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
because
it
was
i
think
a
major
point
of
the
eighth
circuit.
that
is,
they
said
the
united
states,
the
united
states
is
a
big
polluter,
could
avoid
its
own
responsibility
by
not
bringing
any
enforcement
action
and
by
not
settling,
and
you...
you
said
there
would
be
a
disincentive
for
the
prp...
a
disincentive
to
settlement,
but
you
didn't
answer
the
question
of
why
wouldn't
the
united
states
when
it
is
a
polluter
and
it
would
be
responsible
on
this
site,
to
say
well,
we
are
going
to,
we
are
not
going
to
settle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
this
case...
there's
a
point
that
was
made
by
the
eighth
circuit,
and
also
in
the
states'
brief
on
page
24,
and
that
is
that
the
epa
was
engaged
in
settlement
negotiations
with
atlantic
research,
and
then
after
this
court
decided
cooper
industries
that
negotiation
terminated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
person
who
settled,
wouldn't
that
person
be
protected?
wouldn't
the
court
say,
this
person
has
made
a
bargain
with
the
epa
and
we're
not
going
to
extract
any
more
from
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
to
make
the
statute
work
in
harmony,
to
harmonize
107
with
113,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
an
altogether
reasonable
position
for
a
court
to
take.
if
someone
has
settled
and
is
protected
by
virtue
of
that
settlement,
then
when
someone
else
tries
to
go
after
that
same
person
the
court
could
say:
we
have
to
make
the
statute
work
and
we're
going
to
honor
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
talk
about
the
other
polluter
or
the
other
in
this
case,
where
the
other
polluter
is
not
someone
who
is
going
to
settle
because
it's
the
government
itself--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
i
don't
think
you're
in
a
position
to
concede
anything
one
way
or
another
because
that's
not
your
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
government's
concern
that
prenups
shouldn't
go
on
unsupervised.
that's
when
epa
brings
an
enforcement
action,
there's
a
monitor
there.
when
there's
a
settlement,
then
the
government
is
there.
but
if
you
just
go
off
on
your
own
and
do
this,
you're
doing
it
unsupervised
by
any
state
authority,
any
federal
authority,
and
that
could--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
disincentive
to
settlement?
you
just
said
how
important
settlement
was,
or
what
a
good
thing
it
is
to
encourage
it.
but
the
government
says
if
you
could
just
clean
up
without
any
order
and
without
making
any
proposed
settlement,
just
do
it
and
get
back
your
costs,
then
there's
a
powerful
disincentive
to
settle.
