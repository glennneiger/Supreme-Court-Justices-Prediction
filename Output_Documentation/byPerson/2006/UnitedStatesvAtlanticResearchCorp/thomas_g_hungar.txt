mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
113(f)
of
cercla,
congress
created
a
precisely
drawn
detailed
mechanism
for
potentially
responsible
parties
to
recover
their
response
costs
from
other
prps.
respondent
seeks
to
circumvent
the
limitations
that
congress
imposed
on
that
remedy
by
manufacturing
a
parallel
mechanism
for
contribution-like
relief
under
section
107.
respondent's
theory
should
be
rejected
because
it
violates
fundamental
canons
of
statutory
construction,
renders
section
113(f)
superfluous,
makes
a
mockery
of
the
textual
limitations
enforced
by
this
court
in
cooper
industries,
and
would
frustrate
congress's
clear
intent
to
encourage
settlements
with
the
government
in
order
to
achieve
supervised
effective
cleanups.
respondent
essentially
asks
this
court
to
create
a
shadow
contribution
scheme
under
the
guise
of
section
107(a)
by
borrowing
all
of
the
features
of
the
section
113(f)
remedy
except
the
one
that
respondent
can't
satisfy,
namely
the
requirement
that
contribution
be
sought
only
during
or
following
a
civil
action
or
settlement.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
we
agree
that
section
107(a)(1)
through
(4)(b),
subparagraph
(b)
creates
a
cause
of
action
for
private
parties,
in
particular
the
private
parties
who
are
not
prps,
who
are
therefore
other
persons
other
than
the
prps
who
are
the
subject
of
that
statutory
sentence.
so
we
agree
in
that
sense.
we
don't
think
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
for
the
particular
private
parties
who
are
trying
to
sue
in
this
case,
that
is
prps.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
key
tronic,
obviously
the
court
was
facing
a
different
question
so
i
don't
think
it
was
trying
to
in
any
way
authoritatively
resolve
this
issue,
as
the
court
held
in
cooper
industries.
but
i...
certainly
there
is
language
in
cooper...
excuse
me,
in
key
tronic
that
can
be
read
to
suggest
that
the
court
assumed
or
thought
there
was
some
sort
of
remedy
for
prps.
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
referring
to
contribution
or
some
other
remedy.
but
in
cooper
industries,
the
court
made
clear
that
that
was
dicta
and
that's
in
our
view
correct,
because
the
court
in
key
tronic
was
faced
with
a
different
question
altogether.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
people
who
are...
who
are
excluded
by
other
provisions
of
section
107
from
the
category
of
liable
parties
would
be
entitled
to
bring
such
an
action
if
they
don't--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--a
city
that
cleans
up
a
site
and
that
is
not
itself--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
is,
because
a
city
can't
sue
under
subparagraph
(a).
only
the
state
can
sue.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
and
first
of
all,
just
let
me
make
clear:
subparagraph
(b)
doesn't
refer
to
private
parties
only;
it
says
any
other
person.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
with
respect
to
private
parties
in
particular,
any
private
party
who
was
a
so-called
innocent
person
under
the
statute,
who
because--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
read
the
statutory
sentence
in
section
107(a)
as
a
whole,
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
people
in
these
categories,
owners,
operators,
arrangers
and
so
forth,
collect
in
the
conjunctive,
shall
be
liable
for...
and
then
under
(b),
any
other
necessary
cost
or
response
incurred
by
any
other
person.
and
that
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
such
as
subparagraph
(b)
with
respect
to
the
third
party
defense,
subparagraph
(d),
subparagraphs
that
create...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
subsections
that
create
various
defenses,
what
they
say
is
if
you
satisfy
this
defense,
you're
not
liable.
you
are
taken
out
of
the
category
of
liable
parties,
the
category
that
is
the
subject
of
this
statutory
sentence.
and
therefore
in
our
view,
you
become
an
other
person.
so
people
who
are
able
to
satisfy
the
defenses
are
other
persons,
and
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
held
in
cases
where
this
has
come
up.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
collateral
trial.
it's
just
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
think
the
court
could
obviously
structure
the
issues
as
it
saw
fit
but
certainly
that
would
be
one
the
issues
in
the
case,
but
again
people
in
that
category
aren't
the
only--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well
i
don't
think
so
because
what
the
statute
says
is
people,
the
people
who
are
the
subject
of
the
sentence
shall
be
liable
to
other
persons.
and
if
someone
by
virtue
of
the
statute
is
rendered
not
liable--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
are
not
in
the
subject;
they
are
in
the
other
category.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
a...
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute,
were
it
not
for
the
other
"other".
the...
the
statute
in
subparagraph
(b)
refers
to
any,
provides
a
cause
of
action
or
refers,
really
imposes
liability
for
any
"other"
necessary
costs.
the
other
necessary
costs...
that
other,
the
only
other
costs
that
that
(a).
so
the
first
other
in
subparagraph
(b)
makes
clear
that
it's
not
talking
about
the
subparagraph
(a)
claims;
it's
talking
about
other
claims,
because
by
definition
the
united
states
or
a
state
cannot
recover
under
(b)
by
virtue
of
the
first
other.
congress
in
the
development
of
this
language,
the
first
other
was
already
in
the
statutory
language.
congress,
at
the
last
minute
there
was
a
change,
a
compromise
in
order
to
get
the
bill
passed
and
reduce
the
onerousness
of
its
provisions,
and
they
added
the
second
other.
the
only
logical
explanation
and
the
only
way
to
give
effect
to
the
second
other
is
to
construe
it
as
we
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
sir.
and
actually
there's
an
annotation
that,
that
collects
the
cases.
we
haven't
done
an
exhaustive
survey,
but
certainly
the
annotation
is...
which
is
at
12
a.l.r.
f.
2d
161...
collects
a
number
of
such
cases.
and
the
lower
courts
have
addressed
these
questions
and
have,
and
adjudicated
them
so
this
is
not
a
novel
suggestion.
and
it's
one
that
has
arisen
because,
because
remember,
under
the
well
established
law
of
every
circuit
that
had
addressed
the
question
prior
to
the
cooper
industries
decision,
a
prp
could
not
sue
solely
under
section
107(a).
they
had
to
sue,
they
had
to
comply
with
the,
the
section
113
mechanism,
and
the
courts
held
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
disastrous
consequences
that
would
ensue
if
respondents
or
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
the
sky
will
fall
because
under
that
interpretation
prps
can
evade
the
settlement
bar
that
congress
enacted
in
order
to
encourage
settlement,
and
congress's
clear
goal
in
providing
a
contribution
remedy
and
providing
an
explicit
opportunity
for
prps
to
sue
was
to
encourage
settlement
with
the
government.
congress
wanted
to
reduce
litigation,
encourage
settlement
and
government
supervised
cleanups,
and
so
it
created
the
settlement
bar
in
section
113(f)(2),
which,
if
a
prp
settles
with
the
government,
the
united
states
or
a
state,
settles
for
a
response
cost
liability,
it
then
has
a
contribution
action
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
your
honor
in
our
view
what
section
113(f)(3)(b),
the
settlement
contribution
provision,
requires
is
that
a
state
settle,
the
parties
settle
with
the
state
and
resolve
its
liability
to
the
state
for
response
costs
which
is
a
defined
term
under
cercla.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
your
honor,
every
state
has
a
voluntary
cleanup
program
which
encourages
parties
to
settle,
and
under
many
of
those
programs
there
is
an
opportunity
if
they
do
the
settlement
to
required
standards
to
obtain
a
discharge
of
liability
from
the
state
for
response
costs.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
those
settlement
agreements
can't
be
written
and
they
often
are.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
states
already
have
these
programs
in
existence.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
settlement
language
can't
be
written
appropriately
and
moreover,
in
many
states,
i
suspect
most
states,
the
prps
are
required
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
state
that
it
incurs
in
monitoring
and
in
ensuring
that
the
settlement
agreement
is
appropriate.
the
state
of
washington,
for
example,
which
is
here
today,
if
you
look
at
the
web
site
of
its
department
of
ecology,
it
has
extensive
procedures,
extensive
opportunities
for
parties
to
come
to
the
state,
present
the
information,
obtain
a
settlement
if
they
want...
if
they
will
pay
the
state's
costs
in
monitoring
and
making
sure
that
what
the
prp
is
doing
is
an
appropriate
cleanup.
and
that's
what
cercla
should
encourage.
there
are--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
two...
two
responses.
number
one
of
course,
if
that
happened,
there
is
always
the
state
option,
the
states
settled
thousands
of
cases.
number
two,
that's
just
not
the
way
it
works
in
practice.
epa
has
the
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
these
private,
the
private
sites
that
we
are
talking
about.
epa
has
no
incentive
not
to
do
its
job
and
every
incentive
to
do
its
job.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i...
i
think
what
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
a
directive
perhaps
that
requires
epa
to
obtain
the
attorney
general's
approval
before
it
will
issue
a
unilateral
administrative
order.
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
section
107,
excuse
me,
section
106(a)
consent
orders
the,
the
epa
issues.
it
enters
into
numerous
settlement
agreements
in
cases
implicating
federal
prps;
we
cited
a
number
in
our
brief
and
there
are
many
more,
and...
and
epa
has
a
detailed
set
of
standards.
they
occupy
a
hundred
pages.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
we
cite
a
number
from
the
federal
register.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
your
honor
means
filing
a
lawsuit
the
answer
is
no--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
in
our
view
epa
can't
sue
the
united
states.
if
your
honor
means,
i
mean
definitely
there
are
enforcement
actions
or...
proceeding.
the
way
epa
normally
works,
just
to
be
clear,
is
that
when
it
learns
of
a
site,
it
learns
of
a
release
of
hazardous
materials,
it
does
a
preliminary
assessment
to
find
out
whether
this
is
a
problem
or
not,
whether
it's
a
problem
that
they
should
pay
attention
to
or
if
they
should
instead
refer
to
the
state.
and
if
it's
of
sufficient
magnitude
that
it's
for
the
epa
rather
than
the
state
to
deal
with,
they
proceed
to
identify
all
the
prps
they
can
sent
notices
to
them
and
attempt
to
settle.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they
always
do
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
they
attempt
to
settle,
they
attempt
to
settle
with
the
department
of
defense
as
well
as--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
they
wouldn't
sue
them.
if
you
mean
by
sending
notice
to
the
department
of
defense--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
send
a
letter.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they
send
a
letter
to
all
prps.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
believe
so,
but
i--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--they
would...
if,
if
the
private
parties
are
willing
to
settle
and
pay,
and
take
responsibility
for
their
share
of
the
liabilities,
epa
can
and
will
settle
with
them,
regardless.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
number
one
the
department
of
defense
has
additional
legal
obligations
to
deal
with
hazardous
waste
even
beyond
anything
epa
can
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
just,
just
to
be...
just
to
finish
my
last
point,
if
i
may...
which
can
be
enforced
by
citizen
suits.
but
leaving
that
point
aside,
if...
ultimately
they
would
go
to
the
attorney
general
i
suppose
and
ask
for
authority
to
issue
a
unilateral
order.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
that
problem
is
a
significant
one,
and
the
fact
is
there
are
numerous
settlements,
and
they
don't,
under...
under...
for
respondent
to
have
a
cause
of
action,
epa
doesn't
have
to
settle
with
the
federal
prp;
all
they
have
to
do
is
settle
with
the
private
prp,
and
if
the
private
prp
is
willing
to
pay
its
share,
which
epa
determines
according
to
standards
about
its...
vary,
considering
various
factors
about
who
contributed
what
and
who
caused
which
portion
of
the
problem--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
correct.
and
again
if
epa
somehow
refused
to
settle,
the...
they
could
settle
with
the
state.
so
it's
just
not...
epa
does
not
have
any
incentive
to
block
cleanups.
epa
wants
to
encourage
cleanups
and
if
the
best
way
to
get
the
cleanup
done
is
to
settle
with
a
private
party,
then
that's
what
epa
is
going
to
do.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
my
understanding
is
that
the
negotiations
were
between,
were...
atlantic
research
brought
a
claim
seeking,
seeking
money
from
essentially
the
defense
department,
and
my
understanding
was
that
the
negotiations
were
only
to
settle
atlantic
research's
claim
whether
you
call
it
a
contribution
or
a
cost
recovery
claim,
not
an
attempt
by
atlantic
research
to
resolve
its
liability
to
the
united
states.
they
were
not
negotiating
with
epa
with
respect
to
epa's
enforcement
authority.
they
are
negotiating
with
justice
department
lawyers
in
the
environmental
defense
section
who
represent
federal
prp
defendants.
they
weren't...
they
weren't
trying
to
resolve
their
liability
in
order
to
give
rise
to
a
contribution
claim.
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
merely
make
the
united
states
pay
them
without
first
having
resolved
their
own
liability,
which
is
why
it
makes
no
sense
for
them
to
be
bringing
a
contribution
claim.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
first
and
foremost
way
in
which
the
sky
is
falling
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
respondent's
approach
would
eviscerate
the
settlement
bar,
because
the
whole
point
of
the
settlement
bar
is
to
give
parties
an
incentive
to
settle
with
the
government
knowing
that
they
will
be
protected
from
contribution
claims.
but
if
respondent
has
a
cost
recovery
claim
under
section
107,
the
settlement
bar
goes
out
the
window.
and
in
fact
that's
what
a
number
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
in...
in
making
clear
that
section
113
does
govern
these
claims.
epa
has
entered
into
settlements
with
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
prps.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
but
the
claim
here
is
that
the
parties
want
to
pay
the
costs
and
incur
voluntary
cleanup
costs
anyway.
they
just
don't
want
to
settle
first.
so
if
i'm
understanding
your
question--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--maybe
i'm
not
understanding.
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
parties
who
have
already
settled,
shelling
out
some
money
or
not,
with
the
epa
in
reliance
on
the
unanimous
view
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
prps
could
not
sue
them
because
the
contribution
bar
protected
them,
section
113(f)
would
protect
them.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
your
honor,
what
it
applies
to
is
contribution
claims,
and
respondent
and
respondent's
amici
are
very
clear
that
they
want
is
not
a
contribution
claim
because
they
recognize
that
the
settlement
bar
would
preclude
their
claims,
but
a
cost
recovery
claim,
and
section
113(f)(2)
says
"contribution",
not
"cost
recovery".
those
are
very
clearly--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
want
to
call
what
the
prp
is
seeking
a
contribution
claim,
then
we
submit
that
it
should
be
governed
by
the
traditional
understanding
of
contribution
and
by
congress's
explicit
terms
defining
what
it
wants
contribution
claims
to
be.
even
if
you
assume
that
in
some
sense
section
107
imposes
liability
on
prps
to
other
prps,
it
doesn't
say
what
to
do
with
that
liability
and
how
you
litigate
it.
section
113(f)
is
how
congress
explicitly,
carefully
addressed
that
question
and
when
congress
has
done
so
this
court
normally
assumes
that
what
congress
specifically
said
as
the
remedy
and
delineated
as
the
remedy,
including
the
limitations
thereon,
are
what
apply.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
the
normal
rule
in
american
law
is
that
innocent
victims
get
to
sue
the
people
who
have
injured
them
for
recovery,
but
the
defendants,
the
liable
parties,
don't
get
to
sue
each
other
except
in
contribution
when
it
has
been
made
available.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that
might
be
true
in
many
circumstances,
your
honor.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
don't
give
someone
who
can
establish
they
are
innocent
party
a
right
to
full
recovery
and
someone
who
is
not
an
innocent
party
is
relegated
to
contribution.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
a
party
who
qualifies,
who
can
show
that
under
the
third
party
defense
the
hazardous
release
was
not
due
to
any,
any
fault
of
their
own,
and
can
satisfy
the
requirements
of
that
defense.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
yes.
they
could
be
a
subsequent
owner,
for
example,
under
the
bona
fide
purchaser
exemption
or
the
third
party
exemption.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
they
could
also
just
resolve
it
through
settlement,
your
honor.
and
either
they
could
then
proceed
with
their
lawsuit
or,
if
they
want
to
admit
some
minimal
liability
and
obtain
a
contribution
claim,
they
could
proceed
in
that
fashion.
but
there
are
solutions
to
the
problems
that
have
been
identified
under
our
interpretation,
but
there
is
no
plausible
solution
to
the
problems
that
their
interpretation
produce,
including
eviscerating
the
settlement
bar.
it's
no
surprise
that
some
of
the
largest
polluters
in
america
have
lined
up
in
support
of
this
view,
because
this
will
allow
them
to
reopen
settlements
and
go
after
parties
who
thought
they
had
paid
up
their
liability
and
obtained
settlement
protection
by
virtue
of
the
section
113(f)
settlement
bar.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
not
if
the
claim
is
a
cost
recovery
claim
under
section
107,
because
section...
the
settlement
bar
applies
only
to
claims
for
contribution.
this
is
section
113(f)(2),
which
appears
on
page
9a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i
submit
if
the
court
were
seeking
go
harmonize
sections
113
and
107
the
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
give
effect
to
the
limitations
that
congress
imposed
on
prp
remedies,
but
not
merely
the
settlement
bar,
but
also
the
requirement
that
actions
be
brought
during
or
following
civil
actions
and
settlements,
and
also
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
the
respondent's
theory
would
also
permit
them
to
evade.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mr.
chief
justice:
justice
souter,
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
epa
can
and
does
send
prp
letters
to
federal
prp's
without
approval
from
the
justice
department.
the
approval
is
only
for
a
unilateral
administrative
order
under
section
106.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
or
a
unilateral
administrative
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
our
view
the
epa
can't
sue
the
department
of
defense
because
there
would
be
no
justiciable
controversy.
with
respect
to
the
implied
repeal
issue
that
was
discussed,
we
disagree
strongly
with
the
assertion
that
there
was
this
unanimous
group
of
ten
or
some
cases
prior
to
1986.
in
fact
the
cases
were
divided,
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
the
settlement
bar
under
their
interpretation
is
either
eviscerated,
as
respondents
amici
argue,
or
that's
the
position
that
they
take,
that
they
want
to
be
able
to
sue
for
cost
recovery
and
evade
the
settlement
bar.
respondent
of
course
doesn't
make
that
argument
because
they
don't
have
to
in
this
case.
but
unless
the
court
imports
the
settlement
bar
into
cost
recovery
actions,
there's
going
to
be
this
huge
problem.
and
if
the
court
does
import--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
argument
it's
that
there
was
this
unanimous
pre-1986
body
of
law
and
it
was
completely
clear
and
perfectly
understood
that
there
was
this
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but,
your
honor,
the
point
is
it
was
not
clear
in
1986
what
this
language
meant
and
what
the
extent
of
the
prp
rights
were.
congress
addressed
that
question.
there
is
not
a
hint
of
a
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
recognizing
a
prp
action
under
107
independent
of
section
113.
congress
spoke
to
the
question
of
prp's
suing
and
the
only
way
it
spoke
to
it
explicitly
was
in
section
113.
when
congress
says
that,
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
when
congress
speaks
in
an
area
of
uncertainty,
as
in
fausto,
as
in
brock
against
north
dakota,
as
in
the
state
of
vermont,
is
where
the
prior
asserted
right
was
not
clearly
established,
was
not
authoritatively
recognized,
it's
not
an
implied
repeal
question.
it's
a
question
of
reconciling
the
statutes
in
a
way
that
gives
effect
to
the
later
statutes,
a
more
specific
statute.
which
as
here,
section
113,
their
interpretation
gives
effect
to
part
of
it
because
they
say
oh
well,
let's
borrow
a
settlement
bar
to
make
it
all
work,
but
you
can't
do...
you
can't
do
it
that
way.
the
court
rejected
that
very
same
approach
in
the
rancho
palos
verdes
case
from
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
we
agree
that
you
need
to
borrow
the
limitations
of
section
113(f).
you
just
need
to
borrow
all
of
them,
including
the
one
that
they
can't
satisfy,
which
is
that
congress
said
for
suits
by
prp's
against
prp's,
just
like
is
normally
the
case
among
joint
tort
feasors,
it's
a
contribution
suit
and
they
have
to
wait
for
a
law
suit
or
for
a
settlement,
or
some
discharge
of
the
liability.
and
that
also
avoids
burdening
the
courts
with
the
extremely
time-consuming
and
costly
and
difficult
question
of
assessing
whether
the
ncp
has
been
complied
with,
whether
the
costs
comply
with
the
national
contingency
plan.
because
if
they
settled,
then
the
expert
agency
has
already
had
a
chance
to
address
that
and
the
court
doesn't
need
to
get
into
it
in
anywhere
near
the
same
detail.
their
approach
is
a
recipe
for
burdening
the
federal
courts
with
claims
that
congress
did
not
clearly
indicate
should
be
there.
if
states
want
to
provide
contribution
actions
that
allow
these
sorts
of
claims
they
can,
and
many
states
have
done
so,
including
washington
state,
which
is
here.
so
parties
can
bring
these
claims
in
state
court
if
they
want
to.
they
can
get
settlements
from
the
states
if
they
want
to
and
are
willing
to
pay
the
costs.
so
the
burdens
that
they
identify
are
not
there.
implied
repeal
does
not
apply
here
and
because
of
the
uncertainty,
as
we
indicated
at
pages
9
through
10
of
our
reply
brief
and
footnote
5,
there
was
no
unanimous
widespread
consensus
among
the
federal
courts.
this
just
hasn't
come
up
very
much,
and
the
courts
were
divided.
i'd
also
like
to
address...
thank
you.
