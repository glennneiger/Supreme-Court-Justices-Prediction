justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are...
what
are
they?
i
mean
as
i
read
this,
i
can't
get
anything
out
of
the
language.
i
mean
the
two
"others"
might
just
make
it
more
clear.
so
we
have
another
section
113
that
talks
about
contribution
and
it
says
you
can
get
contribution
if
there
has
been
a
lawsuit,
and
so
forth,
or
if
there
has
been
a
settlement.
fine.
now
the
question
comes
up,
well,
suppose
there
hasn't
been
a
lawsuit
or
a
settlement.
now
if
we
look
at
the
language
here,
at
least
my
initial
reading
of
it,
it
does
not
say.
it
says
that
they
are
liable.
these
prps
are
liable
to
this
other
prp
or
person
there.
but
it
doesn't
just
say
explicitly
bring
a
suit,
and
it
doesn't
say
explicitly
you
can't
bring
a
suit.
so
i
think
well,
why
can't
he
bring
a
suit?
if
he
brings
a
suit
how
is
the
sky
to
fall?
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
let
him
bring
a
suit,
they
say
well,
maybe
the
government
just...
will
just
stay
out
of
this.
the
government
won't
enter
into
settlements
because
the
government
is
a
big
polluter.
and
it
would
not
like
to
get
sued
often,
so
they
will
stay
away
from
the
settlement
and
be
home
free.
so
that's
what
they
say
on
your...
on
their
side,
i
think,
primarily.
what
do
you
say
on
your
side?
how
will
the
sky
fall
if
in
fact
they
win
and
they
can
bring
suits
under
107?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i...
can
i
go
back?
because
i'm
trying
to,
since
i
do
find
it
so
open
with
the
language,
what
i'm
doing
is
making
what
i
call
the
list
of
acorns.
you
say
the
sky
is
falling
and
i
want
a
comparative
list.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
their
side
i
have
an
acorn,
which
is
if
they
don't
win,
epa
and
dod
just
are
not
going
to
settle
these
things
because
they
want
to
escape
us
suing
them.
and
you
say,
are
you
kidding?
epa
loves
to
sue.
[laughter]
and
they
like
to
settle.
don't
worry
about
it.
all
right.
on
your
side,
you're
saying
well,
you
know,
if
we
don't...
if
we
don't...
accept
your
interpretation,
they
won't
enter
into
settlements.
to
which
i
guess
they
will
make
the
same
response.
are
you
kidding?
the
epa
loves
to
sue
us
and
we
are
frightened
of
them
and
we'll
settle.
okay.
so
i've
got
one
acorn
each
side,
now
are
there
other
acorns
on
the
government
side;
namely
the
sky
is
falling--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
are
they?
i'd
just
like
to
make
the
whole
list
of
acorns.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
i'm
not
so
sure
because...
unless
you
want
to
stipulate
that
that
restitution...
if
you
want
us
to
write
in
the
opinion
that
in
fact
in
a
107
action
if
one
of
the
parties
sued
has
entered
into
a
settlement
he
shall
have
precisely
the
same
protection
from
suit
as
if
it
were
a
113
action.
do
you
want
to
say
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
would
worry
about
the
equity.
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
want
to
stipulate
that
that's
the
proper
interpretation,
because
i
could
easily
imagine
a
case
where
your
client
bought
a
beautiful
golf
course
and
he
wants
to
turn
it
into
a
golf
course.
unfortunately,
there's
a
little
mess
under
there
and
he
spends
$10
million
on
that.
and
he
says
the
real
fault
is
the
union
oil
company
and
i'm
going
to
sue
them
because
they're
the
ones
who
dumped
this
and
they've
cost
me
$9
million.
and
it
turns
out
that
union
through
precisely
good
luck
and
a
brilliant
attorney
has
settled
this
very
matter
for
one
dollar
with
epa.
barred?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
that's
what
i
thought,
and
that's
what
he's
saying.
that's
what
he's
saying,
that's
why
he
has
brought
his
second
acorn,
because
he
said
there's
a
huge
difference
here.
what
you
will
do
is
if
you
get
this
107
action
you'll
argue
to
the
court
as
to
what's
fair,
but
what
113
says
is
once
you
settle
with
the
federal
government
you're
home
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
you
going
to
choose
this?
because
he
is,
i
think
you're...
maybe
you're
in
a
slightly
awkward
position
because
the
government
is
saying
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
you're
stuck
with
113
is
because
congress
didn't
really
want
through
107
to
give
parties
like
your
clients
an
opportunity
to
review
for
fairness
or
equitable
principles,
whatever
you
like,
the
settlements
that
had
taken
place
with
the
defendant
in
epa.
and
that's
so
we
can
get
people
to
settle,
among
other
things.
they
feel
they're
home
free.
now,
you
have
two
choices
here.
i
think
you
could
say,
one,
well,
that's
the
way
it
is,
we
should
have
a
107
action
and
we
should
review
these
settlements
for
fairness;
or
two,
you
could
say
one
of
the
principles
of
fairness
is
the
principle
that's
written
into
113
about
no
review,
and
we're
happy
with
reading
that
into
107.
so
which
is
it
that
you
would
like
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
that's
absolutely
true,
you
mean
absolutely
true
that
you
have
that
choice,
or
is
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
so
then
he's
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
motivating
force
behind
this
action
is
to
permit
people
to
get
equitable
review
of
prior
settlements?
what
you
simply
want...
and
you're
not
interested
in
that;
you'll
go
with
no
equitable
review
of
private
settlements.
read
113
into
it.
you
want
the
right
to
bring
the
case
where
there
has
been
no
settlement
and
government
has
done
nothing.
