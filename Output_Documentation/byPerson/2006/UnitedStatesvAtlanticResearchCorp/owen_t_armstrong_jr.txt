mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
the
settlement
bar.
one
thing
that
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
is
that
a
cost
recovery
action
under
107(a)(4)(b)
is
an
action
for
restitution.
this
is
an
equitable
action.
there
is
no
jury
trial
under
cercla.
the
district
court
is
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
just
pointed
out,
the
court
is
empowered
in
any
case,
any
107(a)(4)(b)
case,
to
accord
settlement
protection
to
a
settling
party
as
a
matter
of
equity.
it
may
do
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
equity
or,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it
may
do
so
by
virtue
of
a
contribution
counterclaim
by
the
settling
party.
so
the
court,
a
district
court,
is
empowered
to
give
full
protection
to
any
party
who
has
settled
so
long
as
the
matters
addressed
a
portion
of
107--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
equity
should
accord
in
most
cases...
now
there
may
be
exceptions--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
barred
in
that
case.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
your
hypothetical,
spending
one
dollar,
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
sitting
in
equity
and
also
as
a
matter
of
a
contribution
counterclaim
would
be
entitled
to
review
the
settlement
and
if
that
matter
is
in
the
matters
addressed,
if
it
has
been
resolved
by
the
government...
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
a
settlement,
settlements
are
publicly
noticed,
so
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
object
to
any
settlement
which
they
feel
is
unfair.
and
presumably
our
golf
course
owner
would
be
identified
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be
unfair
any
more
than
it
would
be
unfair
in
a
contribution
action,
in
which
case
the
court
is
directed
to
apply
principles
of
equity
in
allocating
responsibility.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
congress
did
write
that
into
the
contribution
part
of
the
statute--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--well,
i
believe
in
every
settlement
agreement
the
court
would
have
to
engage
in
an
analysis
as
to
what
matters
addressed
are
for
purposes
of
the
settlement.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
true,
because
i
think
one
of
the
principles
of
fairness
is
to
solidify
the
settlement
agreement.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
i
believe
that
a
reviewing
court
should
in
each
instance...
if
a
district
court
decides
to
avoid
the
settlement,
if
it
says
that
it's
not
fair,
i
believe
that
would
undercut
the
finality
of
a
settlement
so
long
as
it's
contained
within
the
matters
addressed.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
in
our
case,
your
honor,
and
i
think
we've
stipulated
to
that.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
in
our
case,
i
think
as
we
have
made
it
quite
clear,
all
we
are
seeking
in
this
case
is
to
recover
a
proportion
of
our
response
costs.
we
cannot
concede,
because
we
are
not
confronted
with
the
issue
that
has
been
posed...
i
would
not
object
as
a
matter
of
a
bright
line
rule
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
a
settlement
is
protected
from
a
back
end
or
a
roundabout
107(a)(4)(b)
action
in
order
to
disturb
a
settlement
agreement.
we
do
not
have
those
circumstances
in
this
case,
that
is
correct.
and
we
are
only
seeking
restitution
in
our
case.
we
are
seeking
an
equitable
result,
a
proportionate
share
of
arc's
response
costs.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
in
most
cases
there
is
state
involvement.
there
is
in
the
arc
case,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record.
we
have
entered
into
a
cooperative
relationship
with
the
state
in
cleaning
up
the
site.
and
i
think
in
almost
every
case
a
prp
is
well
advised
to
bring
in
experts
to
make
sure
that
the
cleanup
is
consistent
with
the
national
contingency
plan,
because
absent
that,
satisfying
that
requirement,
the
prp
is
not
entitled
to
recover
any
of
its
costs.
so
there
is
a
very
demanding
requirement
written
into
cercla.
the
national
contingency
plan
occupies
9605
and
it
occupies
several
hundred
pages
of
40
c.f.r.
part
300.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
although--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--107(a)(4)(b)
would
include
both
prps
and
what
we
might
call
non-prps.
i
believe
one
of
the
amicus
parties
studies
364
cases
between
the
years
of
1995
and
2000
and
there
was
one
case
out
of
that
364
that
involved
precisely
your
hypothetical,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
prps
will
certainly
be
able
to
seek
cost
recovery
under
107(a)(4)(b).
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
there
are
very
few
non-prps.
the
only
non-prps
that
i
can
think
of
is
perhaps
the
hypothetical
you
just
advanced,
because
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
so-called
innocent
adjoining
landowner
is
a
prp,
is
a
covered
person
under
107(a)(4)(b),
and
only
has
a
defense
to
liability.
and
it
is
absolutely
true
that
in
order
to
bring
an
action,
according
to
the
government,
that
particular
prp
would
have
to
establish
through
affirmative
action
that
it's...
that
it
satisfies
the,
the
liability
exclusion
in
107(b).
and
that
is
a
very
drawn
out
process.
the
criteria
for
satisfying
the
defense
in
107(b)
takes
up
2
1/2
pages
of
the,
of
the
statute.
so
what
we
are
involved
in
in
that
case,
your
honor,
is
yes,
prps
may
bring
cost
recovery
actions.
and
i
think
that
was
true
in
1980
when
the
statute
was
passed.
contrary
to
the
government's
representation,
there
are
10
cases
holding
that
actions
may
be
brought
under
107(a)(4)(b)
by
so-called
prps
between
the
time
that
cercla
was
passed
in
1980
and
the
amendment
to
cercla
in
1986,
in
october
of
1986.
courts
held
without
exception,
without
exception,
that
covered
persons
or
prps
indeed
do
have
a
right
to
bring
a
cost
recovery
action
under
107(a)(4)(b).
and
congress
when
it
passed
113,
was
looking
at
those
cases
only
that
had
some
doubt
about
whether
contribution
could
also
be
brought.
in
other
words,
whether
a
party
could
seek
restitution
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
compelled
to
do
a
cleanup
via
a
lawsuit.
and
some
courts
found
that
there
was
an
implied
right
to
contribution,
some
found
that
there
was
a
common
law
right,
but
congress
in
1986
specifically
said,
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
implied
right
to
contribution,
given
this
court's
holding
in
the
northwest
airlines
case
and
in
texas
industries.
congress
was
concerned
that
there
would
be
no
right
to
contribution
unless
it
codified
that
right,
which
it
did
in
1986.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
disturb
or
to
cut
back
on
the
rights
that
courts
had
found
consistently
in
that
six-year
window
between
1980
and
1986,
all
of
which
held
that
prps
indeed
do
have
a
right
to
bring
cost
recovery
actions.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
it
did,
although
most
of
these
cases
i
do
believe
did
not
involve
settlements,
but
i
think
obviously
when
congress
enacted
113,
i
think
it
certainly
wanted
to
encourage
settlements
in
cases
where
there
had
been
an
action
brought
against
a
prp.
obviously
i
think
settlement
saves
everybody
the
time
and
effort
of
litigating
these
matters,
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
in
113
we
get
contribution
protection,
we
get
the
ability
to
bring
a
contribution
action.
so
certainly
settlement
was
a
key
element
of
113
but
it
was
a
key
element
of
that
provision,
not
section
107.
but
i
think
congress
has
made
it
quite
clear
to
encourage
settlements,
if
it's
in
the
matters
addressed,
that
there
should
be
immunity
for
those
parties
that
are
settling
their
claims
with
the
government
or
a
state
in
a
judicially
approved
or
administratively
approved
settlement.
so
i
don't
believe--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
once
again,
settling
is
not
a
disincentive
in
the
sense
that
if
you
do
settle,
you
are
deemed...
all
of
your
costs
are
deemed
to
be
consistent
with
the
national
contingency
plan.
you
need
not
be
concerned
in
that
particular
case
about
satisfying
the
burden
of
proof
that
you
have
as
a
prp
that
your
costs
are
consistent
with
the
national
contingency
plan,
which
is
no
easy
matter.
the
national
contingency
plan
as
i
stated,
appearing
in
40
c.f.r.,
part
300,
occupies
a
good
hundred
pages.
it
is
a
very
detailed
and
demanding
set
of
requirements.
so
there
is
a
strong
incentive,
i
still
believe,
for
parties
to
settle
because
in
such
a
case
they
do
not
have
to
establish
that
there
is
consistency
with
the
national
contingency
plan.
they
also
obtain
immunity
from
suits,
assuming
it's
in
the
matters
addressed.
now
a
party
that
voluntarily
remediates
a
site
has
to
worry
about
both
of
these
elements.
it
can
be
sued.
it
has
no
immunity.
it
is
certainly
subject
to
being
sued
by
another
prp,
by
a
state,
an
indian
tribe,
or
the
government,
regardless
of
how
much
or
how
well
it's
done
in
remediating
a
site,
whereas
a
settlement
gives
that
protection
to
a
prp.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
the
second
factor
is--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
because
in
cleaning
up
a
site,
you
can
clean
up
all
or
part
of
a
site.
that's
what
113(f)(3)(b)
states.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
i
believe
it--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
language
more
broad
than
that.
i
do
believe
the
first
use
of
the
word
other
that
opposing
counsel
referred
to
is
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
there
can't
be
a
duplication
of
liability.
obviously
a
prp
that
is
exposed
to
liability
in
a
case
cannot
be
required
to
pay
both
the
government
and
the
other
party
who
is
cleaning
up
the
site.
and
i
would
say
that
the
second
use
of
the
word
other,
which
has
become
quite
critical
in
the
government's
argument,
the
government
i
think
concedes
that
the
way
the
statute
initially
read
in
the
first
draft
omitted
the
term
other
and
simply
read
any
person.
and
the
government
says
well,
the
insertion
of
the
word
other
prior
to
the
enactment
of
cercla
indicates
that
what
congress
intended
was
to
withdraw
from
that
huge
basket,
if
you
will,
all
prps.
well,
that
is
not
the
case
at
all,
because
initially
the
definition
section
of
person
that
was
contained
in
the
initial
draft
of
cercla
did
not
include
the
united
states.
it
cross-referenced
the
clean
water
act.
so
the
united
states
was
not
a
person
within
the
initial
draft.
and
the
addition
of
the
word
other,
the
second
other
in
107(a)(4)(b)
was
to
make
it
clear.
otherwise,
you're
going
to
have
a
statute
that
says
the
government
can
recover
under
(a)(4)(a)
and
(a)(4)(b).
so
i
do
believe
that
the
addition
of
the
second
word
other
simply
explained
and
clarified
that
the
government
was
to
bring
its
action
under
107(a)(4)(a),
not
under
107(a)(4)(b).
and
i
think
as
justice
scalia
has
mentioned
before,
it
would
be
very
odd
for
congress
to
have
so
drastically
changed
cercla
by
inserting
the
word
other
without
any
commentary
whatsoever.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
debate
about
the
exclusion
of
joint
and
several
liability
under
cercla,
about
the
exclusion
of
contribution,
and
other
matters.
there
was
not
a
mention
made
of
the
addition
of
the
word
other
preceding
person
in
107(a)(4)(b).
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
it
would
be
tantamount
to
a
repeal.
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
logic
is
impeccable,
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
because
that...
that
law
was
well
established
and
there
was
no...
there
was
no
such
thing
as
contribution.
there
was
no
protection
prior
to--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--no
acorns.
[laughter]
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
any
other
litigation
whatsoever.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
(f)(2)
does
provide
is
in
a
settlement,
if
a
party
is
seeking
under
cercla...
now
when
you
say
other
litigation,
i
assume
you
perhaps
mean
state
law,
etcetera.
if
it's
a
state
law
contribution
claim,
i
believe
that
provision
would
afford
immunity
from
a
state
law
contribution
claim,
assuming
it
could
be
asserted.
now
of
course
it
could
not
be
asserted
against
the
united
states.
but
i
do
believe
that
that
language--
mr.
owen
t.
armstrong
jr.
--if
it
were
a
cercla
claim,
your
honor,
under
107(a)(4)(b),
it
would.
however,
if
it
is
not
a
claim
based
upon
cercla,
and
there
are
certainly
a
myriad
of
claims
that
can
be
brought...
remember,
cercla
is
a
strict
liability
provision...
i
don't
believe
that
would
bar
all
lawsuits
entirely.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
there's
nothing
further--
