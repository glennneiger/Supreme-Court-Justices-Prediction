may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
your
position
on
the
meaning
of
the
settlement
provision
in
113(f)(2)?
do
you
read
it
to
provide
not
only
immunity
from
contribution
suits
but
from
any
other
litigation
whatsoever?
justice

if
there
were
a
claim
that
didn't
really
technically
qualify
as
contribution,
it
would
not,
it
would
not
provide
a
bar.
