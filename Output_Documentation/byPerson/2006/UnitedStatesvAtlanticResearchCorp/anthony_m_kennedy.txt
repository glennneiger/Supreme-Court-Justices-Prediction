well,
almost
by
definition
a
settlement
is
for
less
than
the
full
amount
that
you'd
have
to
spend
without
the
settlement,
almost
by
definition.

you
don't
usually
settle
for
100

of
your
liability.

means
that
in
every
settlement
agreement
you'd
have
to
engage
in
this
analysis
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
fair.
