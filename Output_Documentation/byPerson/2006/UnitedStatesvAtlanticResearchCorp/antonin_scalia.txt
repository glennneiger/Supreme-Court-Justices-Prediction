but
you
have
to
pay
the
costs.
i
mean,
isn't
that
something
of
a
disincentive?
before
you
can
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
skip
away
from
a
settlement
without
having
to
pay
any
money.
but
in
order
to
come
under,
under
9607,
they
have
to,
they
have
to
shell
out
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
there
are
two
factors
which
still
exert
pressure
to
settle.
one
is
that
you
don't
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
you
conform
with
the
national
contingency
plan,
and
second,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
insulate
yourself
from
contribution
suits
by
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
rely
at
all
on...
in
9607(a)(b)?
it
says
any
other
necessary
costs
of
response
incurred
by
any
other
person.
does
the
word
"any"
add
anything
to
your
case?
do
you
think
it
urges
us
to
give
the
broadest
possible
interpretation
to
other
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
necessary
costs?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you
say
this
very
language
that's
in
107
now
had
been
interpreted
unanimously
by
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
part
of
your
case
is
that,
is
to
say
that
it's
limited
by
113
is
to
say
that
there's
been
an
implied
repeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
all
those
cases
were
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
just
a
legislative
history
point
you're
making,
it's
not
just
a
point
as
to
what
congress's
expectations
were.
it's
also...
it's
also
a
point
that
relates
to
implicit
repeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
government's
only
strong
point
is
that
113
is
meant
to
coerce
settlement,
and
113
didn't
exist
before,
then
it
must
be
very
clear
that
previously
107
did
give
them
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
acorns
on
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
the
states
prefer
to
proceed,
to
force
people
to
proceed
under
113,
so
that
the
states
would
have,
you
know,
a
hand
in
deciding
how
the
cleanup
should
go?
i
don't...
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you're
here.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
states'
interest
would
be
similar
to
the
government's.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
last
sentence
of
(f)(1),
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
meaning
of
that
last
sentence
in
(f)(1),
"nothing
in
this
subsection
shall
diminish
the
right
of
any
person
to
bring
an
action
of
contribution
in
the
absence
of
a
civil
action.
"
of
a
civil
action
under
9606
or
9607?
what
are
they
referring
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
there
wasn't,
you
wouldn't
have
your
principal
argument,
which
is,
you
know,
which
is
that
the
reason
not
to
interpret
107
the
way
your
friends
on
the
other
side
want
is
that
you're
going
to
destroy
the
settlement
provision
of
113,
which
didn't
use
to
exist.
what
argument
would
you
make
for
having
us
read
the
word
"other"
in
the
what
seems
to
me
strange
way
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
missing
my
point.
my
point
is
the
settlement
bar
didn't
used
to
exist.
so
previously,
whether
the
cases
were
split
or
not,
there
was...
your
best
argument
for
the
proposition
that
107(a)
does
not
permit
suit
did
not
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
it
didn't
exist.
assume
that
body
of
law
didn't
exist.
but
what
would
you
have
argued
when
somebody
came
in
and
said
107,
this
provision,
includes
prp's?
you
may
have
argued...
your
best
argument
would
not
have
been
available.
