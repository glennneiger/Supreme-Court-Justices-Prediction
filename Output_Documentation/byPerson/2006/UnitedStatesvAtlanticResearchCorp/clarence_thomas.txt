justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
respondent
atlantic
research
leads
the
facility
where
it
retrofitted
rocket
motors
for
petitioner
the
united
states.
the
retrofitting
process
resulted
in
contamination
of
the
facility.
under
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
compensation
and
liability
act
(cercla),
both
atlantic
research
and
the
united
states
are
potentially
responsible
for
the
contamination.
after
atlantic
research
voluntarily
cleaned
up
the
site
it
sought
to
recover
some
of
its
expenses
from
the
united
states
by
filing
suit
under
cercla
sections
107(a)
and
113(f).
after
atlantic
research
filed
suit
we
decided
cooper
industries
versus
aviall
services,
which
foreclose
atlantic
research’s
section
113(f)
claim
for
contribution.
the
district
court
then
dismissed
atlantic
research’s
107(a)
claim
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
section
107(a)
permitted
one
potentially
responsible
party
sue
another.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
cercla
section
107(a)
defines
four
categories
of
persons
as
potentially
responsible
parties
and
makes
those
persons
liable
for
certain
contamination
cause.
cercla
also
authorizes
two
causes
for
the
actions
for
private
parties.
in
section
107(a),
that
permits
cost
recovery
by
certain
parties
and
section
113(f)
it
permits
liable
parties
to
seek
contribution.
the
dispute
here
seen
is
on
what
person
subparagraph
(b)
of
section
107(a)
permits
to
seek
cost
recovery.
the
text
of
subparagraph
(b)
allows
suits
by
“any
other
person.”
in
our
view
the
phrase
“any
other
person”
in
subparagraph
(b)
can
be
understood
only
with
reference
to
the
immediately
preceding
subparagraph.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
phrase
“any
other
person”
refers
to
persons
other
than
those
listed
in
the
preceding
subparagraph
because
this
preceding
subparagraph
list
only
the
united
states
or
state
or
an
indian
tribe
all
persons
other
than
those
three
may
sue
under
subparagraph
(b).
atlantic
research
therefore
qualifies
as
any
other
person
and
may
recover
its
cost
under
the
plain
language
of
subparagraph
(b).
contrary
to
the
government’s
arguments
this
interpretation
of
section
107(a)
will
not
unduly
conflict
with
section
113(f)’s
cause
of
action
for
contribution.
the
two
provisions
authorized
clearly
distinct
remedies
and
provide
causes
of
actions
to
persons
in
different
procedural
circumstances.
accordingly,
section
107(a)
does
not
swallow
the
remedy
provided
by
section
113(f).
nor
does
today’s
decision
undermine
the
settlement
bar
provided
in
section
113(f)(2).
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
