chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-562,
united
states
versus
atlantic
research
corporation.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well
you've
glided
over
the
great
difficulty
which
is
it
doesn't
say
that
people
identified
in
the
statute
shall
be
liable
to
other
persons.
it
says
they
will
be
liable
to,
under
certain
circumstances,
the
united
states,
a
state
or
an
indian
tribe
and
they
are
liable
for...
for
other
costs
incurred
by
any
other
person.
and
it
just
seems
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
construction
is
that
the
other
refers
to
other
than
the
united
states
or
a
state
or
an
indian
tribe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
sure
are
you...
how
sure
are
you
that
it
doesn't
protect
them
still?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
one
responsible
party
has
paid
out
the
cost
and
is
seeking
a
cost
recovery
claim
from
another
responsible
party,
it's
not
too
much
of
a
stretch
to
call
it
a
contribution
claim,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
worried
about
any
of
that
when
you're
dealing
with
an
innocent
party,
the
person
you
say
can
bring
this
action
under
107(4)(b).
don't
all
those
same
concerns
and
objections
apply
in
that
case
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
know,
you
don't
know,
that
you're
dealing
with
an
innocent
party
until
the
end
of
the
litigation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
another
example
of
an
innocent
party
who
can
bring
an
action
under
107(4)(b)
other
than
a
governmental
subdivision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they're
somehow
affected
by
the
hazardous
release.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they're
still
somehow
affected
by
the
hazardous
release.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
my
point
is
that
subsequent
owner,
epa
is
going
to
start
looking
at
him
as
a
prp,
not
as
an
innocent
party.
in
other
words,
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
an
awful
lot
of
litigation
before
he
can
establish
that
he
is
not
a
prp
and
is
instead
an
innocent,
innocent
party.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
armstrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there's
nothing,
there's
nothing
unnecessarily
unfair.
it
turns
out
that
the
union
oil
company
is
bankrupt
and
in
part
of
the
settlement
they
agreed
to
turn
over
all
the
documents
listing
whoever
it
was
that
gave
them
the
chemicals.
and
it's
a
very
complicated
thing
because
we're
dealing
with
people
often
in
these
cases
that
don't
have
assets
and
only
limited
responsible
parties
have
the
assets.
so
they're
trying
to
recover
what
they
can
from
the
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
you
read
the
statute,
you're
talking
about
a
prp,
but
any
other
person
doesn't
have
to
be
a
prp,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
set
up
a
company
that
cleans
up
these
sites,
right,
and
go
traveling
around
the
country
and
clean
them
up
and
then
send
people
a
bill
and
cite
your
reading
of
1074(b),
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
rule
in
your
favor
presumably
there
will
be
a
lot
more,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
non-prps?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thanks,
mr.
armstrong.
mr.
geck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
how
it
works?
they
would
have
to,
if
you
bring
a
107
action,
the
defendant
has
to
bring
his
responsive
action
under
113?
or
is
it
as,
i
guess
your
friend
had
stated
earlier,
equitable
principles
are
going
to
lead
to
an
allocation
of
responsibility
under
107?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
geck.
mr.
hungar,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
06-562,
united
states
versus
atlantic
research
corporation.
