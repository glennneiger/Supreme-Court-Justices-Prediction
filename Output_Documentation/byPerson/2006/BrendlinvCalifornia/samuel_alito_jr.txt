and
would
that
apply
if
a
bus
was
pulled
over?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
everybody
on
the
bus
is
seized?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
this
case,
is
it
correct
to
view
this
as...
to
view
it
this
way:
as
soon
as
the
officer
approached
the
car,
as
i
understand
it,
he
recognized
the
defendant
as
a
potential
parole
violator.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
there
would
be
reasonable
suspicion
then
from
that
moment
on,
for
at
least
a
brief
detention
of
the
individual
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
warrant
for
the
individual.
so
all
we're
talking
about,
the
only
period
of
potential
seizure
that
we
have
to
worry
about
is
up
to
the
moment
when
the
officer
sees
mr.
brendlin.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
other
words,
any
seizure
after
that
point
would
be
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
officer
went,
before
even
approaching
the
car
got
on
the
loudspeaker
and
said:
"driver
remain
in
the
car;
passenger,
you're
free
to
go?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
situation
where
the
police
officer
says
on
the
loudspeaker
passenger
remain,
driver
you're
free
to
go,
and
the
example
that
the
state
has
in
their
brief,
in
which
a
car
is
stopped
and
as
a
result
of
the
way
it's
stopped
on
a
narrow
road,
the
other
cars
behind
that
car
are
for
some
other
period
of
time
prevented
from
going
forward?
what's
the
difference
between
those
two
situations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
explain
the
justification
for
stopping
if
there
is
the
seizure,
for
stopping
the
innocent
passenger
because
the
driver
has
committed
a
traffic
violation?
if
that's
a
seizure
of
the
passenger,
then
it's
a
seizure
without
reasonable
suspicion
of
probable
cause,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
this
period
of
time
that
we
are
talking
about
when
mr.
brendlin
might
or
might
not
have
felt
that
he
was
free
to
leave?
as
i
understand
the
facts,
the
officer
recognized
him
as
one
of
the
two
brendlin
brothers
immediately
upon
approaching
the
car.
isn't
that
right.
