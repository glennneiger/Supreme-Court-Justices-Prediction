justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
california
supreme
court
as
far
as
i
could
tell
was
thinking
that
it
turns,
if
you
stop
somebody,
you
stop
somebody,
if
you
make
him
think
he
isn't
free
to
go.
so
you
seem
to
me
to
give
a
lot
of
cases
where
he
would
feel
free
to
go,
and
you're
saying
still
that
that's
a
stop.
well,
i
mean,
suppose
the
policeman
comes
along
and
he
sees
three
people
in
a
car
and
there
is
jack
the
ripper
driving.
so
he
says
okay,
i'm
stopping
the
car.
now
he
says
the
other
three
people,
i'm
not
interested
in
you;
my
pal
and
partner
here
is
in
a
second
squad
car;
he
will
take
you
wherever
you
want
to
go.
have
they
been
stopped?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
find
authority
for
that
in
the
law.
at
least
not
in
this
court.
i
mean,
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is.
maybe
you
are.
i
think
that
would
be
very
interesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
brower--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what,
what
were
the
facts
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
a
roadblock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
it
says
here,
getting
out
their
quote
from
it,
is
it
says
it
does
not
occur
whenever
there
is
a
governmentally
caused
termination
in
individual's
freedom
of
movement,
nor
even
where
there
is
a
governmentally
caused
and
governmentally
desired
termination
of
an
individual's
freedom
of
movement.
that
only
when
there
is
a
termination
of
freedom
of
movement
through
means
intentionally
applied.
now,
the
only
way
i
can...
i
mean
i
say
the
difference
between
desired
is
that
they
didn't
want
to
stop
him.
they
are
not
interested
in
stopping
him.
that's
not
our
desire
to
stop
him.
our
desire
is
to
stop
the
driver.
so
if
you
don't
have
the
desire
and
if
there
is
no
real
restriction
of
any
significance,
is
there
a
stop?
i
mean
i
would
say
brower,
they
cited
on
their
side,
for
that
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
passenger,
you
also
have
to
have
two
things.
one
they
don't
intentionally
want
to
stop
him.
two,
he
doesn't
think
his
movement
is
restricted.
where
both
of
those
things
are
true,
then
no
stop.
that's
why
the
people
who,
say,
are
on
the
railroad
car
and
they
stop
the
whole
train,
that
the
railroad
says
don't
worry,
not
an
inconvenience:
we'll
have
another
train
for
new
10
or
15
minutes;
just
get
out,
except
for
car
one
where
there
is
jack
the
ripper...
you
know,
those
other
people
are
not
stopped.
now
that's
their
argument.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
the
question...
so
i
want
to
know
how
to
decide
this
case.
i
understand
what
your
position
is.
but
i
think
the
normal
instinct
of
everybody
is
not
about
boats,
taxis,
airports
and
all
these
other
examples,
but
this
case.
and
i,
i
would
say
if
you
want
to
go
on
instinct
i
wouldn't
think
of
getting
out
of
a
car
when
i'm
the
passenger
and
the
policeman
has
stopped.
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
so
when
you
asked
a
million
policemen,
how
many
instances
did
they
tell
you
about
where
they
stopped
the
car
and
all
the
passengers
jumped
out
and
walked
away?
was
there
one?
was
there
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
matter
if
they're
on
the
santa
monica
freeway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
it
would
be
pretty
dangerous
to
get
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
we
supposed
to...
i
think
it's
quite
interesting.
how
do
you
suggest
we
decide
this/i
don't
mean
the
result,
but
i'll
go,
i'll
say
yes,
you've
done
your
survey
of
the
policemen,
a
million
policemen
think
they're
not
restricting
the
movement
of
the
passenger.
very
few
passengers
jump
out
of
the
car,
but
that
may
be
because
they're
worried
about
being
run
over.
so
you
say,
well,
in
fact
they're
restricted,
but
they
don't
think
they're
being
restricted
by
the
police,
or
do
they?
and
here
we
have
no
idea,
at
least
i
have
no
idea.
i
really
don't
know
what
the
majority
think
and
yet
it
would
seem
totally
relevant.
how
would
we
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
perhaps
i'm
having
so
much
difficulty,
and
maybe
others
are,
because
you've
actually
reached
a
question
of
law
where
facts
matter.
that
is,
the
law
points
us
to
the
direction
of
what
would
a
person
reasonably
think
in
general
in
such
circumstances,
and
we
can
look
at
five
million
cases,
but
we
don't
know.
so
what
do
we
do
if
we
don't
know?
i
can
follow
my
instinct.
my
instinct
is
he
would
feel
he
wasn't
free
because
the
red
light's
flashing.
that's
just
one
person's
instinct.
or
i
could
say,
let's
look
for
some
studies.
they
could
have
asked
people
about
this,
and
there
are
none.
or
i
could
say,
well,
you're
the
state
of
california,
you're
the
ones
able
to
get
the
studies;
you
could
tell
some
of
those
professors,
you
know,
to
stop
thinking
about
whatever
they're
thinking
about
and
go
ask
a
few
practical
questions,
but
you
didn't.
what
should
i
do?
hold
that
against
you?
look
for
more
studies?
follow
my
instinct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
question
hasn't
been
argued
here.
