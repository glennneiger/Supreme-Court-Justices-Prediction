ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
pleast
the
court:
when
an
officer
makes
a
traffic
stop,
activates
his
flashing
lights,
he
seizes
not
only
the
driver
of
the
car
but
also
the
car
and
every
person
and
everything
in
that
car.
this
unremarkable
conclusion
is
what
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
rule
on,
rule
today.
this
simple
rule
is
not
only
firmly
rooted
in
this
court's
precedence,
it
also
protects
police
officers
and
the
liberty
interests
of
everyone
traveling
on
a
public
state
highway.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
whether
or
not
you
can
get
out
and
catch
another
cab
is
sort
of
a
separate
issue,
but
at
the
moment
that
the
car
comes
to
a
stop
you've
been
stopped
by
a
government
means
intentionally
applied,
and
i
believe
you
are
seized
at
that
point.
after
that
it
may
become
a
factual
question
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
it
may
be
significantly
different
from
that,
from
the
question
we
face
in
a
case
like
this
where
it's
a
passenger
in
a
private
car.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
if
a
bus--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--once
again,
a
forward
motion
stopped
by
government
means
intentionally
applied
is
a
seizure
under
this
court's
holding
in
brower.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
at
that
point
what
you
believe
is
not
necessarily
the
dispositive
issue.
the
dispositive
issue
is
that
your
freedom
of
movement
has
been
curtailed
by
government
action.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
exactly,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that's
the
rule
we
apply
with
respect
to
drivers.
we
don't
normally
formulate
it
that
was
because
usually
there's
a
directive
from
the
officer
saying
okay,
you're
free
to
leave,
there's
a
clear
point
where
the
seizure
ends.
but--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--exactly.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
in
terms
of
determining
when
mr.
brendlin
was
seized,
yes.
the...
there--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
except
in
this
case
of
course,
it
would
be
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
since
the
state
has
continued--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--the
arrest
itself...
the
arrest
itself
is
still
a
product
of
the
exploitation.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
yes.
we
concede
that
the--
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
have
a
case
that
has
these
specifics
in
it.
this
is
a
new--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well
actually,
i
would
turn
to
the
cases
that
talk
about
searches
incident
to
arrest
and
also,
go
back
to
the
rationale
for
the
intended--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well
actually,
let's
look
at
thornton
and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--thornton
and
knowles
are
two
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
relatively
recently
where
you
talk
about
the
rationale
for
searches
incident
to
arrest.
they're
not
cases
that
i
would
have
considered
to
be
directly
on
point
for
the
seizure
issue
in
this
case,
but
in
knowles
the
court
held
that
you
can't
search
a
car
incident
to
arrest
on
a
minor
traffic
stop
because--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--if
i
can
divide
this
into
two
issues.
first
we
have
the
issue
of
the
arrest
itself,
and
i
am
aware
of
no
mechanism
by
which
mr.
brendlin
would
be
entitled
to
suppress
the
arrest
itself,
to
not
be
arrested
on
the
parole
warrant,
or
to
get
out
of
jail
free,
so
to
speak.
that
is
a
separate
issue,
however,
than
discussing
whether
or
not
the
evidence
that
comes
out
of
this
auto
search
which
is
a
direct
product
of
the
illegal
stop
should
be
admissible.
and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
i
think
we
have
to
look,
as
i
said,
at
the
purpose...
the
rationales
for
allowing
a
search
incident
to
arrest
are
the
need
to
disarm
the
suspect
or
take
him
into
custody,
and
the
need
to
preserve
evidence
for
trial.
in
this
specific
case
he's
arrested
on
a
parole
warrant.
i
can't
imagine
what
evidence
in
that
car
would
be
needed
to
be
preserved
in
order
to
proceed
on
the
parole
warrant.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
the
search
incident
to
an
arrest
is
an
exception
to...
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
the
proposition--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
if
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply,
we
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
if
we
allow
officers
to
make
a
stop
on
a
hunch
that
someone
has
a,
has
a,
has
a
warrant
or
whatever,
we
have
essentially
reduced
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
it
applies
to
traffic
stops,
as
it
has
historically
applied
to
traffic
stops.
this
is,
this
is
not
a
new
proposition
that
if
you
stop
a
car
and...
if
you
saw
something
in
plain
view
after
an
illegal
stop,
it
wouldn't
be...
it
would
still
be
excluded.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
i
believe
you
misunderstood
me.
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
plain
view
doctrine
would
allow
admission
of
that
evidence.
if
the
stop
is
illegal
then
anything
the
officer
seized--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
first,
your
honor,
a
slight
correction.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
this
was
an
issue
issued
by
an
detached
magistrate
because
what
we
call
in
california
a
powell
warrant
under
california
penal
code
section
3000(v)(a)--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--yes.
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
issued
by
the
board
of
prison
terms.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
but
in
terms
of
why
we
don't
do
this,
it's
the
reason
we
exclude
evidence
in
general
when
it's
unlawfull
seized,
when
it
is
the
direct
result
of
a...
of
a
stop
that
is
illegal
from
its
inception.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well...
well
actually
we
have
a
test
for
this.
it's
the
brown
test;
it's
the
wong
sun
test,
and
the
people
have
the
burden.
the
test
is
if
the,
even
there
is
attenuation,
which
i...
which
is
what
the
people
are
arguing,
the
warrant
in
this
case
is,
that's
not
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
we
also
look
at
the
flagrancy
of
the
officer's
misconduct,
and
we
look
at
the
temporal
proximity
to
the
initial
illegality.
and
in
this
case
that
attenuating
circumstance
is
simply
not--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
your
honor,
i
think,
actually
i'm
not
sure
that
the
driver
in
this
case
is
going
to
have
a
remedy.
if
we
look
at
the
steps
in
this
case,
first
we
have
this
officer
who
makes
an
illegal
stop.
he
continues
that
detention
in
order
to
run
warrant
checks
on
both
parties;
he
finds
probable
cause
to
arrest
mr.
brendlin;
he
searches
the
car
incident
to
the
arrest,
even
though
the
belton
rationale
search
incident
to
arrest
perhaps
is
a
bit
shaky
in
the
case,
because
mr.
brendlin
is
in
the
back
of
the
car,
and
it's
a
parole
warrant.
but
at
that
point
the
officer
also
searches
the
driver,
and
if
the
evidence
is,
or
if
the
taint
is
attenuated,
as
to
mr.
brendlin,
and
this
is
a
lawful
search
incident
to
his
arrest,
i
don't
really
understand
how
the
driver
is
going
to
have
a
remedy
as
well.
and
in
fact--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--the
driver
is
not
a
party
to
the
appeal,
but
she
was
convicted,
and...
and...
and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--no,
it's
not.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
no,
your
honor.
i
was
responding
to
the
question
doesn't
the
driver
have
a
remedy?
you
know,
isn't
that
enough
to
provide
deterrence?
but
if
we
allow
a
warrant
by
one
person
of
the
car
to
attenuate
the
search,
search
of
the
car,
then
as
i
read
this
court's
precedents,
the
search
is
attenuated,
the
taint
is--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--have
they
been
stopped
by
the
initial
seizure?
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
the
initial
stop
of
the
car,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
i
think
the
brower
decision--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--the
brower
opinion
has
a
very--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
in
brower
there
was
a
roadblock--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--the
car
crashed
into
it.
but
the,
the
crucial
question,
the
crucial
issue
was
was
means
intentionally
applied
by
the
government.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
i
think
then
we'd
have
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
and
whether
someone
feels
free
to
leave
and
jump
out
of
a
moving
car.
but
i...
i--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--that's
how--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--if
it
is
by
means
intentionally
implied,
yes.
i
think
that's,
that's
how
hodari--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--well,
then
it
would
be
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
i
agree
with
you
that
they
are
two
independent
tests,
and
as
i
went
through
this
court's
precedents
i
frankly
could
not
find
a
single
case
in
which
a
person
had
been
in
motion
and
stopped
and
came
to
a
stop,
the
physical
stopping
of
motion,
in
which
this
court
did
not
find
that
a
seizure
had
occurred.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--i
think
that
what
we
have
here,
is...
as
i
said
it's
really
the
way
we
look
at
it
with
drivers
as
well.
there
is
a
bright
line.
the
car
comes
to
a
stop
as
a
result
of
this
display
of
authority,
you
are
seized.
from
that
point
on
when
you
would,
when
a
reasonable
person
would
feel--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--i
think
that's
true.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
i
think
a
reasonable
person
would
not
feel
free
to
leave.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
i
think
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
any
court
would
have
a
hard
time
saying
the
passenger
is
not
free
to
leave
then,
unless
there
is
some
other
intervening,
some
other
factor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
he
is
seized
by
the
stop,
absolutely.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
the
two
different--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--i
do
accept
their
analytical
distinction,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
just...
it's
actually
two
different
fact,
two
different
points
in
time.
there's
the,
there's
the
seizure
that
occurs
when
the
car
stops;
and
then
there
is
the
continuing
seizure
during
the
course
of
the
traffic
stop
which
for
the
driver
has
a
fairly
clear
ending
point;
for
a
passenger
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
facts.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
that
difference
is
actually
addressed
directly
in
brower.
brower
addresses
that
exact
hypothetical.
it
says
a
passerby
who
is
inconvenienced
by
another
stop.
there
you
have
government,
a
government-caused
termination
of
movement
but
it's,
but
there
is
no
intentionally,
means
intentionally
applied.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
your
honor,
where
you're
looking
at...
we
have
to
look
at
the
objectively
observable
facts,
which
in
this
case
are
the
flashing
lights.
we
don't...
i
mean
the
passenger
has
no
particular
way
of
knowing
what
the
officer's
intent
is,
which
i
think
is
why
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
officer's
object
intent
in...
in...
is
irrelevant
to
the
equation.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
my
response
is
the
same
as
it
has
been.
the
passenger
is
certainly
stopped
when
the
car
comes
to
a
halt.
we
discuss
in
our
brief
that
there
are
reasons
why
a
passenger
could,
why
the
car
could
be
stopped,
as
far
as
the
passenger
knows,
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
we
have...
whereas
it
was
an
unreasonable
stop,
there
was
no
traffic
violation,
neither
the
passenger
nor
the
driver
has
any
reason
to
know
why
they
are
being
stopped,
and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
still
say
that
the
passenger
is
seized
when
the
car
comes
to
a
stop.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
one
way
or
the
other.
i
was
responding
to
the
suggestion
that
the
passenger
should
somehow
be
aware
of
the
officer's
intent
and
know
when
he
sees
flashing
lights
that
it
means
the
driver...
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
proper
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--that's
a
physical
stop,
but
it's
not...
it's
not
the...
the
means
intentionally
applied
portion
of
the
test
doesn't
work
or
it
doesn't
satisfy
it.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
no.
i
would
say
that
that's
a
reasonable,
a
reasonable
stop.
that's
the
risk...
when
you
get
into
the
car
as
a
passenger,
you
take
a
risk
that
you
may
be
subject
to
a
reasonable
search
or
reasonable
detention.
but
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
provide
any
protection
for
anyone
against
reasonable
detentions
and
that
would
be
a
reasonable
detention.
was
there
a
question?
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
no,
your
honor.
some
of
those
people
in
the
airport
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
the
passengers
in
bostick
and
drayton,
where
they
weren't
going
anywhere
in
the
first
place,
and--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--i
would
say
some
of
those
people
would
be
in
the
position
of
the
passer-by,
the
passers-by
identified
in
brower.
possibly
some
of
them
would
be
seized,
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
would
be
a
reasonable
seizure
and
wouldn't
necessarily...
i
mean
a
reasonable
seizure,
there's
no
fourth
amendment
protection
against
a--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--given
the
extreme
leeway
given
in
airports,
if
it's
so
bad
that
there
wasn't
reasonable
suspicion
to
shut
it
down,
i'd
say
that's
probably
a
reasonable
result
for
shutting
down
entire
airports
for
no
reason
whatsoever.
but
under
the
fact
that
you
posited,
it
sounds
like
it
would
be
exigent-sent
circumstances
or
something
else
that
would
make
that
a
reasonable
suspicion.
going
back
to
our,
to
the
test
that
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
adopt,
the
most
important
thing
i
can
say
about
this
test
is
not
only
does
it
reflect
what
i
think
is
the
real
life
expectation.
it
also
protects
officer
safety
by
providing
a
measure
of
predictability
for
both
passengers
and
drivers
and
as
well
for
officers.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
thank
you.
just
to
respond
to
that
last
question
very
briefly,
i
agree
with
justice
kennedy
that
wilson
could
not
have
been
decided
the
way
that
it
was
decided
had
there
not
been
an
underlying
assumption
that
the
passenger
is
seized,
because
wilson
does
not
require
any
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
posing
a
danger
to
the
driver.
i'd
also
like
to
respond
to
the
state's
argument
that
the
passenger
in
this
case
simply
got
unlucky
and
he
was
in
a
car
with
someone,
that
he
happened
to
be
in
a
car
with
someone
who
was
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense.
this
passenger
wasn't
merely
unlucky;
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
an
unreasonable
stop
that
was
unreasonable
from
its
inception.
not
only
did
the
officer
have
no
reason
to
make
the
stop;
he
had
actually
called
in
and
verified
and
gotten
affirmative
evidence
confirming
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
stop.
so
it--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--because
your
honor,
this
court
has...
this
court
held
in
delaware
versus
prouse,
the
court
recognized
the
passengers
as
well
as
drivers
have
a
liberty
interest
in
free
travel
on
the
highways,
and
because
if
we
look
at
every
case
this
court
has
decided
in
the
last
20
or
30
years
regarding
when
a
seizure
occurs,
the
case
of
a
passenger
in
an
auto
test...
in
an
auto
stop
meets
the
test.
under
hodari
d
we
need
a
show
of
authority
or
physical
control;
in
this
case
we
have
both.
we
have
the
driver
response
to
the
officer's
show
of
authority
and
as
a
result
the
passenger
is,
is
subject
to
physical
control,
as
a
direct
line.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
if
the
person
has
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
suitcase
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
court
has
recognized
in
delaware
vs.
prouse
that
a
passenger
does
have
a
privacy
liberty
interest
in
free
travel.
so
it's
a
different
situation.
once
again,
going
back
to
the
brower
case,
the,
there
was
some
question
about
whether
or
not
the,
the
seizure
of
a
bystander
would
be,
would
be
a
seizure
under
the
rule
proposed
by,
by
petitioner
in
this
case.
brower
talks
about
an
entirely
accidental
seizure.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
no.
but...
but
under
the
rule
proposed
by
the
state
if
there
had
been
a
passenger
that
passenger
would
not
have
been
seized.
but
if
we
look
at
how
this
court--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--yes,
your
honor.
but
if
we
look
at
the
case
next
in
line
case,
the
county
of
sacramento
versus
lewis
case,
there
was
a
passenger
in
that
case
who
was
struck
by
the
officer
in
the
pursuit,
and
although
the
court
found
no
seizure
it
didn't
base
that
on
the
fact
that
the
person
was
a
passenger,
but
on
the
fact
that
it
was
an
accidental
application
of
force.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
i
think
it
certainly
informs
the
discussion,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
hasn't
been
an
intentional
impeding
of
those
people's
free,
free
movement
by
the
officer.
the
officer
has
intentionally
stopped
this
vehicle.
and
i...
i
don't
think
it's
really,
it's
really
far-fetched
to
argue
that
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
that
automobiles
often
have
passengers
in
them,
and
there
is
certainly
a
large
body
of
statutory
law
at
least
in
california
that
shows
that
the
car
can
be
stopped
for
reasons
related
to
the
passenger.
so
it's,
it's
a
different
situation.
we
are
not
looking
at
an
accidental
seizure.
we
are
looking
at
an
intentional
seizure
of
the
car.
just
to
address
for
a
moment
whether
or
not
remand
is
appropriate
in
this
case,
just
to
clarify
the
procedural
posture.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
in
california
did
rule
this,
that
the
evidence
seized
in
this
case
was
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
and
should
be
suppressed.
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
grant
review
on
that
issue
and
it
was
not,
it's
not
included
in
the
question
presented.
just
for
clarification.
but
if
the--
ms.
elizabeth
m.
campbell
--no.
the
court
did
not...
did
not
actually
request
briefing
on
the
issue
either.
thank
you.
