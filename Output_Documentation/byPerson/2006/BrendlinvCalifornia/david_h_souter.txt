justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
bus
is
stopped,
the
car
is
stopped
and
so
on,
the
role
for
the
test
about
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
regard
himself
as
free
to
leave
is
a
test
to
determine
when
the,
when
the
seizure
ends,
as
distinct
from
when
the
seizure
begins?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
other
role
for
that
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
you're
taking
the
position
that
whenever
you
are
in
a
vehicle
that
is
stopped,
you
are
seized?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
why...
why
doesn't
plain
view
kick
in
just
as
readily,
once
it
is
conceded
as
it
has
to
be,
that
at
the
point
that
he
was
making
the
arrest,
the
officer
was
acting
lawfully?
and
if
he
was
acting
lawfully
when
he
made
the
arrest,
why
doesn't
he
get
the
benefit
of
the
plain
view
doctrine
to
the
extent
that
he
saw
any
evidence
before
him
at
that
point?
and
i
take
it
the
plain
view
exception
would
at
least
cover
the,
i
forget
what
it
was,
but
the
materials
that
were
in
the,
in
the
passenger
well
of
the
passenger
car,
that...
that
were
known
to
be
used
as
a
source
of,
of
ingredients
for
making
methamphetamine?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize.
but
we've
got...
we've
got
a
choice
here,
i
mean,
i
think
justice
kennedy's
questions
brought
this
out.
we've
got
a
choice
here
of
two
ways
to
look
at
the
state
action
at
the
moment
of...
of
the
arrest.
one
way
to
look
at
it
would
be
to
say
it
was
a
product
of
an
unlawful
stop.
another
way
to
look
at
it
would
be
to
say
it
was
an
act
of
executing
a
validly
issued
warrant.
and
you
concede
that
they
at
least
could
lawfully
have
executed
the
arrest,
they
didn't
have
the
arrest
warrant
but
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
issued
for
them
and
they
could
lawfully
execute
that
warrant
and
arrest
him
at
that
point.
let's
assume
that
those
are
our
two
choices.
on
choice
number
one
the
state,
the
police
officer,
is
acting
someplace
where
he
shouldn't
have
been.
on
choice
number
two,
the
parole
violator,
your
client,
is
in
a
place
where
he
shouldn't
have
been
because
he
should
have
been
arrested
and
he
should
have
been
back
behind
bars
at
that
point.
if
we
have
a
choice
between
those
two
ways
of
looking
at
the
case,
why
don't
we
for
any
purpose,
give
the
casting
vote
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest,
to
the
warrant
which
was
issued
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
at
some
point?
and
if
we
do
that,
then
why
isn't
not
only
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
but
the
seizure
of
materials
which
were
in
plain
view
at
the
moment
of
that
arrest,
subject
to
a...
an
admissibility
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
it
was,
it
was
a
warrant
that
was
lawful
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
is
that
conceded?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
all
right,
but
you're
simply
saying
we
give,
we
put
the
greatest
emphasis
on
act
a,
stopping
the
car
rather
than
act
b,
lawfully
arresting,
regardless
of
the
legality
of
stopping
the
car.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
we,
do
we
have
do
we
have
in
any
of
the
cases...
i,
frankly
i
don't
recall.
i
remember
brown
but
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
in
brown
comparable
to
the
lawful
authority
to
arrest
independent
of
the
stop.
and...
and
that's
what
makes
this
case
unusual.
and...
and
if
we
emphasize
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest,
quite
independent
of
the
circumstances
of
the
stop,
and
we
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
point
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is...
is
to
deter
police
conduct,
and
you've
got
another
priority
here,
the
driver,
who
can
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule
and
deter
police
misconduct.
i
don't
see
where
the
interest
would
lie
in,
or
where
the
justification
would
lie,
in
our
saying
we've
got
to
put,
as
it
were
all
the
eggs
in
the
basket
of
the
unlawful
stop,
as
opposed
to
the
basket
of
the
lawful
arrest.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
you're,
you're
blending
two
tests
together,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
one
test
is
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
police
get
control
over
people,
those
people
are
not
free
to
go.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
are
the
motion
cases.
the
most
extreme
example
being
the...
the
roadblock.
hodari
d,
did
they...
you
know,
they
were
trying
to
catch
him
but
did
they
actually
get
to
the
point
of
a
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
then
you
got
another
category
of
cases
in
which
there
is
no
question
that
someone
is
stopped,
that
a
police
officer
can
exercise
control,
and
that
control
if
so
exercised
is
certainly
going
to
be
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
but
we
don't
know
whether
the
officer
really
is
exercising
control,
so
we
ask
the
question
would
a
reasonable
person
in
the
position
of
the
individual
stopped
have
believed
that
he
was
free
to
go?
aren't
those
two
quite
distinct
tests?
the
first
test
assumes
the
answer
to
the
question
in
the
second
test.
the
second
test
assumes
the
answer
to
the
first
test,
i.e.,
they're
stopped,
subject
to
control.
aren't
they
two
independent
tests?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
you
were
engaging
in
shorthand?
you,
you
accept
the
analytical
distinction
but
you
say
look,
in
the
real
world
once
you
stop,
we...
we
know
how
the
person
would
have
felt?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
reasonable
person
would
have
felt.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
aren't...
you
are
saying,
i
thought
by
agreeing
with
you
what
you
were
saying
was
once
the
car
is
stopped,
a
reasonable
person
under
those
circumstances
would
not
have
felt
free
to
leave.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you're...
you're
blending
the
two
tests
together
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
either
got
to
accept
their
analytical
distinction
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
consistent
with
that
answer,
consistent
with
that
answer,
what
we're
concerned
with
in
these
cases
is
not,
in
cases
like
this,
is
not
literally
the
moment
of
the
stop,
but
the
moment
of
the
stop
plus
one.
and
in
cases
like
this
the...
i
take
it
you
concede
the
question
is
would
the
passenger,
would
a
reasonable
passenger
in,
in
that
situation
feel
free
to
leave.
and
in
the
absence
of
a
hypothetical
like
justice
alito's
in
which
the
loudspeaker
says,
all
i
want
is
the
driver,
passenger
is
free
to
go,
and
so
on,
absent
something
like
that,
what
is
the
argument
that
the,
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
passenger
seat
would
feel
free
to
open
the
door
and
traipse
off?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
ever
been
stopped?
have
you
ever
been
subject
to
a
traffic
stop?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
heart
rate
went
up.
the
blood
pressure
went
up.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--don't
you
think
that
a
reasonable
passenger
at
that
point
would
assume
that
the
officer
is
in
control
and
that,
in
the
absence
of
some
affirmative
indication
that
the
passenger
can
go,
that
he's
supposed
to
sit
there
until
this
thing
gets
over
with?
isn't
that
the
reasonable
response
of
a
passenger?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
zall,
assume,
and
i--
realize
you
don't
assume,
but
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that,
that
there
is
a
seizure
here.
what's
the
significance
of
the
arrest
warrant,
or...
yes,
i
guess
there
was
a
warrant
as
i
understand
it,
although
it
was
not
on
the
person
of
the
officer
who
stopped
the
car.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what's
the
significance
of
that
for
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
we
have
two
problems
if
we
go
to
that
stage?
the
first
one
is
we
would
be
applying
a
test
that
was
not
applied
by
the
court
we're
reviewing.
and
number
two,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
the,
the...
assuming
you
win,
as
it
were,
on
the
general
point
about
the
significance
of
the,
of
the
arrest
warrant,
there
are
still
going
to
be
questions
about
the
suppression
of
the
evidence
because
there
are
going
to
be
questions
about
whether
the
legality
of
the
arrest
on
that
theory
suffices
to
justify
the
seizure
of
the
evidence.
you
recall
the
colloquy
i
had
with
opposing
counsel
about
the
possibility
of
applying
a
plain
view
test
here.
aren't
those
issues
that
should
all
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
in
the
state
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
in
the
morning
of
november
27th,
2001
the
police
stopped
the
car
to
check
its
registration
but
without
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
car
was
being
operated
unlawfully.
during
the
traffic
stop
one
of
the
officers
recognized
the
petitioner
bruce
brendlin
who
was
a
passenger
in
the
car
as
a
parole
violator
after
verifying
that
brendlin
was
subject
to
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant,
the
officer
formally
arrested
him,
and
searched
him,
the
driver
and
the
car
finding
materials
used
to
make
methamphetamine.
brendlin
move
to
suppress
evidence
in
the
ensuing
prosecution
arguing
that
the
traffic
stop
was
an
unlawful
seizure
of
his
person.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion,
but
the
california
court
of
appeal
reversed
holding
that
brendlin
was
seized
by
the
traffic
stop
which
was
unlawful.
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
in
turn
finding
that
although
the
officers
stopped
the
car
without
justification
the
evidence
seized
was
not
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
seizure
because
brendlin
as
a
passenger
was
not
seized
when
the
car
was
stopped,
rather
the
sate
supreme
court
said,
brendlin
was
seized
only
at
the
point
of
his
formal
and
otherwise
lawful
arrest.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
vacate
the
california
supreme
court’s
opinion
and
hold
that
when
a
police
officer
makes
traffic
stop
a
passenger
in
the
car
like
the
driver
is
seized
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
and
so
may
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
stop.
the
critical
question
under
our
precedent
is
whether
a
reasonable
in
brendlin’s
position
when
the
car
was
stopped
would
have
believed
himself
free
to
leave
or
otherwise
terminate
the
encounter
with
the
police.
we
think
any
reasonable
passenger
would
have
understood
that
the
officers
were
exercising
control
to
the
point
that
no
one
in
the
car
was
free
to
depart
without
police
permission.
a
traffic
stop
necessarily
curtails
the
passenger’s
travel
as
much
as
it
halts
the
driver’s.
it
diverts
both
from
the
stream
of
traffic
to
the
side
of
a
road
and
the
police
activity
that
normally
amounts
to
intrusion
on
privacy
and
personal
security
does
not
and
did
not
here
and
distinguish
between
passenger
and
driver.
an
officer
who
orders
a
car
to
pull
over
acts
with
an
implicit
claim
on
right
based
on
fault
of
some
sort
and
a
sensible
person
would
not
expect
the
officer
to
allow
people
to
come
and
go
freely
from
the
physical
focal
point
of
an
investigation
into
faulty
behavior
or
wrongdoing.
if
the
likely
wrongdoing
is
not
the
driving,
the
passenger
will
reasonably
feel
subject
to
suspicion
owing
to
close
association
with
the
driver,
but
even
when
the
wrongdoing
is
over
bad
driving,
that
passenger
will
expect
to
be
subject
to
some
scrutiny
and
his
attempt
to
leave
would
be
so
obviously
likely
to
put
a
prompt
an
objection
from
the
officer
that
no
passenger
would
feel
free
to
leave
in
the
first
place.
it’s
also
reasonable
for
passengers
to
expect
that
an
officer
at
the
scene
of
a
crime
arrest
or
investigation
will
not
let
people
move
around
in
ways
that
could
jeopardize
his
safety.
our
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
views
of
all
nine
federal
courts
of
appeals
and
nearly
every
state
court
who
have
ruled
on
a
question.
the
supreme
court
of
california
reached
a
different
result
based
on
three
arguments
that
we
find
unpersuasive.
first
the
state
court’s
assertion
that
the
officers
only
intended
to
investigate
the
car
as
driver
impermissibly
shifts
the
issue
from
the
intend
of
the
police
as
objectively
manifested
to
the
motive
of
the
police
for
taking
the
intentional
action
to
stop
the
car.
applying
the
objective
test
described
above
we
conclude
that
a
reasonable
passenger
would
understand
that
he
was
subject
to
the
police
display
of
authority.
second,
although
the
state
court
correctly
noted
that
brendlin
had
no
affective
way
to
signal
submission
while
the
car
was
moving
once
it
came
to
a
stop
he
could
and
apparently
did
submit
by
staying
inside.
he
was
there
before
seized,
when
the
car
came
to
a
halt
on
the
side
of
the
road.
third,
the
rule
announced
today
does
not
encompass
motorists
whose
movement
is
imputed
due
to
traffic
stop
with
another
car.
an
occupant
of
the
car
who
knows
he
is
stuck
in
traffic
because
another
car
has
been
pulled
over
would
not
perceive
to
police
show
of
authority
to
be
directed
to
him
or
his
car.
for
the
reason
stated
we
vacate
the
state
supreme
court’s
opinion
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
in
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
state
courts
will
have
to
consider
in
the
first
instance
whether
suppression
trends
on
any
other
issue.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
