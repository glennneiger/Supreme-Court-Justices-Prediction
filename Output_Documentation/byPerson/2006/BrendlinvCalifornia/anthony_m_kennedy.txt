justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
question.
do
you
concede
that
this
arrest
was
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
the
arrest
was
lawful?
the
officer
was
obligated
to
arrest
this
person,
knowing
what
he
did,
was
he
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
case
in
which
we
exclude
the
evidence
seized
incident
to
an
arrest
when
the
arrest
is
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
think
you
did,
and
that's
my
concern.
i
assumed
that
this
officer
was
required
to
arrest
the
person,
and
we
can
have
hypotheticals,
he
sees
somebody
wanted
for
multiple
murders
and
so
forth.
but
i'm
just
not
aware
of
authority
which
says
that
when
the
arrest
is
lawful
and
the
search
is
incident
to
that
arrest,
that
the
evidence
is
excluded.
what's
your
best...
what's
your
closest
case
you
can
give
me
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i
have
one
please?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thornton,
i'm
not
familiar
with
immediately.
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
this
was
the
search
of
a
person
incident
to
an
arrest,
and
i
really
jumped
a
little
bit
ahead
of
the
questions
that
justice
alito
was
proposing.
there
may
have
been
a
moment
in
which
the
officer
did
not
have
the
authority
to
act
and
he
did,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
once
he
has
this
knowledge,
there
is
now
an
intervening
cause
and
the
arrest
is
proper,
and
the
search
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
authority
do
you
have
that
the
operation
of
the
exclusionary
rule
depends
on
the
offense
for
which
he
was
arrested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
authority
for
the
proposition
you
just
offered?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
search
incident
to
an
arrest
leads
to
an
exclusion
in
one
case
and
not
in
another
case,
depending
on
the
charge
on
which
he
was
arrested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
have
an...
an
argument
that
something
was
seized
from
the
driver
that
should
not
have
been
seized
from
his
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
that's
not
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
talking
about
evidence
seized
from
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
representing
the
state
of
california
and
you
want
to
establish
the
proposition
that
any
time
there
is
a
traffic
stop
in
the
state
of
california
or
i
guess
anywhere
in
the
united
states
all
the
passengers
are
free
to
immediately
leave,
absent
some
further
countermanding
officer...
order
by
the
officer.
i
think
that's
a
quite
surprising
proposition.
now,
we
don't
have
empirical
studies
and
so
forth,
but
at
some
point
the
court
takes
judicial
notice
and
i
think
indications
from
the
bench
are
we
just
don't
think
passengers,
a,
are
or,
b,
should
feel
free
to
leave
when
there's
a
traffic
stop.
i
just
think
you
have
no
social
or
empirical
documentation
for
that
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
on
your
earlier
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
there's
no
authority
in
this
court
to
say
that
whether
you
deem
yourself
stopped
or
not
depends
on
whether
think
you're
innocent.
there's
zero--
authority
for
that,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
passenger
knows
the
minute
the
red
light
goes
on
that
the
police
can
either
tell
them
to
get
out
or
tell
him
to
stay
in.
he
knows
at
that
very
moment.
that
seems
to
me
to
substantially
limit
his
freedom
of
action
and
indicates
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
maybe
our
questions
took
your
colleague
representing
the
petitioner
beyond
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
is
only
whether
the
passenger
felt
seized.
if
we
agree
with
the
petitioner,
do
we
send
the
case
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why,
if
we
have
serious
doubts
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
suppressible?
all
we've
been
asked
in
the
question
is,
is
whether
the
passenger
is
detained.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
while
the
questions
indicate
that
even
if
the
passenger
is
detained,
who
cares,
it's
a
lawful
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
may
be
that
we
would
say
because
of
the
exclusionary
rule
dynamic,
we
have
very
little
interest
in
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
we
should
bend
the
concept
of
seizure
and
say
that
the
passenger
hasn't
been
seized.
perhaps
we
should
be
very
liberal
insofar
as
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
and
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
there
is
lawful
arrest
which
is
intervening
cause
anyway.
but
i
don't
know
that
we
should
distort
the
law
of
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
in
that
case
there
was
a
blanket
rule.
the
officer
didn't
have
to
have
a
specific
reason.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
indicates
that
that's
because
the
person
as
a
general
rule
knows
that
he
or
she
is
seized.
if
the
officer
had
to
give
a
specific
reason
requiring
the
person
to
stand
outside
as
the
dissent
said,
then
you
might
have
had
a
point.
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
held.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there
was
only
one,
there
was
just
the
driver
in
the
brower
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
no
passenger
as
i
recall.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean
in
the
case
it's
just
not
directly
on
point.
that's
what
we
are
arguing
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
just
another
case
that
doesn't
help
us.
