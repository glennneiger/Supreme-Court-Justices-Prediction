the

the

justice

ginsburg
--mr.
zall,
let's
say
we
have
just
an
intelligent
reasonable
person
reads
the
newspaper
and
says:
oh,
they
handed
down
a
decision
today
that
said
the
police
can
order
me
to
get
out
of
the
car,
the
police
can
order
me
to
stay
in
the
car.
how
could
such
a
person
feel
free
to
leave
knowing
that
it
is
the
law
that
that
person
can
be
told,
get
out,
or
if
he
tries
to
get
out,
stay
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be
that
you
can
walk
away,
you're
not
in
an
enclosed
space.
suppose
the
passenger
knows
when
the
police
approaches:
oh
my
goodness,
i
didn't
buckle
up.
would
that
passenger
be
the
object
of
the
police
authority
from
the
start?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
could
be,
it
could
be
sometimes
the
attention
is
directed
at
the
driver,
but
that's
not
always
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
that's
presented
is
kind
of
a
standing
question.
it's
who
can
complain
when
the
police
stop
a
car?
you
say
the
driver.
the
question
that's
been
presented
in
this
case
is,
can
the
passenger
also
complain,
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
we're
dealing
with.
so
the...
the
arrest
warrant
may
pose
a
disqualification
for
this
particular
passenger,
but
that
would
be
a
second
question.
the
question
that
is
tendered
to
us
and
that
was
answered
by
the
california
supreme
court
is
when
the
car
is
stopped
by
the
police
who
can
complain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
of
the
question
that
was
raised
about
well,
a
passenger
is
locked
in
for
the
moment,
but
so
are
all
the
cars
that
are
backed
up
behind
the
car
that's
been
stopped?
what's
the
difference
between
the
passenger--
