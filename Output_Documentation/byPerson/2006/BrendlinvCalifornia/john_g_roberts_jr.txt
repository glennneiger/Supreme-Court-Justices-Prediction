justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
06-8120,
brendlin
versus
california.
ms.
campbell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't
apply
in
a
taxicab,
right?
i
mean,
the
cab
is
driving
erratically,
the
officer
pulls
it
over.
if
i'm
a
passenger
in
the
cab,
i
think
i
can
get
out
and
catch
another
cab,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
have
no
reason
if
you
were
a
passenger
on
a
bus
in
the
normal
case
to
assume
that
the
officer
was
concerned
about
you.
your
view
would
not
be
that
they
are
stopping
me,
you'd
think
they're
stopping
the
bus
because
the
driver
ran
a
red
light
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
state
he
is
still
seized
because
the
car
is
stopped.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
does
that
make
a
difference?
let's
say,
you
know,
the
car
drives
through
a
red
light
and
the
police
lights
come
on.
the
passenger
surmises
that
it's
because
they
ran
a
red
light.
so
that's
a
different
case?
you
would
say
it's
not
seized
if
he
reasonably,
objectively,
reasonably
assumes
it's
because
of
what
the
driver
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
why
are
we
pointing
out
that
they
didn't
know?
it
makes
no
difference
under
your
view
of
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
if
all
that
matters
is
the
physical
stop,
what
do
you
do
about
the
cases
that
were
talked
about
earlier
where
the
other
cars
have
to
stop
because
of
the
way...
that's
a
physical
stop
and
yet
our
cases
indicate
you're
not
seized
in
those
situations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
zall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there's
a
suitcase
in
the
back
seat?
just
the
driver,
the
driver's
pulled
over,
and
then
somebody
comes
walking
down
the
sidewalk,
the
driver's
friend,
he
opens
the
car
door,
takes
the
suitcase
and
starts
walking
away?
wouldn't
the
policeman
say,
put
that
back,
because
he
thought
he
had
seized
not
just
the
driver
but
everything
in
the
car,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
the
suitcase.
you
wouldn't,
you
wouldn't
reasonably
think
someone
could
just
take
something
out
of
the
car
that's
been
stopped
by
the
officer
and
walk
off
with
it,
right?
everything,
all
the
contents
of
the
car,
are
seized
as
well
as
the
driver,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
not,
if
the
opposite
is
true,
then
it
is
a
seizure
even
though
they
stop
the
car?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
they
make
that,
even
if
they
make
that
interest
clear
prior
to
the
stop?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
they
pull
up
next
to
them
and
they
see
that
brendlin
is
the
passenger
and
they
yell
over:
pull
over,
brendlin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
the
police
who
have
authority
over
the
passenger;
it's
the
driver.
the
driver's
exercising
authority.
just
because
the
police
say
to
pull
over,
the
driver
can
take
off
and
the
passenger
isn't
seized
at
that
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there's...
you
know,
our
brown
case
establishes
a
multifactor
test
for
determining
when
the
illegal
seizure
has
been
attenuated
and
the
court
hasn't
applied
that,
the
california
supreme
court
hasn't
gone
through
that
test
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
seizure
of
a
passenger
or
a
driver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
miss
campbell,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that...
so
that,
still
then,
it's
just
begging
the
question
of
whether
or
not
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
you're
making
a
good
case
that
the
driver's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated,
but
why
isn't
the
passenger,
as
your
friend
said,
just
in
the
unlucky
circumstance
to
have
been
in
a
car
whose
the
driver's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
it
found
there
was
no
seizure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-8120,
brendlin
v.
california.
