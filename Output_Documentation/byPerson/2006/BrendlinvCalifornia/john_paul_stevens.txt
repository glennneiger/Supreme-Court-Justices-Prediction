justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
after
the
stop
the
passenger
in
the
back
seat
starts
to
get
out
and
the
officer
says:
stay
in
the
car.
is
he
then
seized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
mean
that
the
authority
to
cause
the
person
to
stay
in
the
car
existed
throughout
the
stop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
on
a
casual
street
in
downtown,
if
they
say,
i'd
like
to
stop
and
talk
to
you,
you
don't
have
to
stop.
there's
no
authority
to
make
them
stop.
but
there
is
authority
for
the
passenger
in
the
back
seat
of
the
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
difference
between
legal
authority
and
factual
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
no
difference
then
there's
legal
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there's
no
difference
then
there's
legal
authority,
which
would
mean
the
person
is
subject,
is
in
custody
of
the
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
encounters
in
an
airport
where
there
are
pedestrians;
there's
no
authority
to
make
the
person
stay,
where
here
i
think
you've
conceded
that
there
is
legal
authority
to
require
the
person
to
stay
where
he
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
wasn't
a
seizure
what's
the
source
of
the
legal
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
your
case
he
doesn't
in
fact
have
the
authority,
he
has
apparent
authority,
but
in
this
case
he
has
actual
authority,
not
just
apparent
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
10
or
20
years
ago
we
had
this
case
and
we
decided
your
way
and
decided
passengers
are
not
seized,
and
then
subsequently
we
had
the
question
of
whether
an
officer
could
order
a
passenger
out
of
the
car.
what
would
be
held
then?
would
we
have
said
we
can't
because
he
is
not
seized?
or
would
you
say
yes,
he
was
seized.
i
meant
if
we
decided
in
your
case
there
is
no
seizure,
would
we
then
have
later
on,
do
you
think
said,
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
seizure
the
officer
could
order
the
person
out
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
most
situations
where
an
officer
meets
a
person,
unless
there
is
a
crime
scene
or
something
like
that,
he
can't
order
them
to
cross
the
street
or
go
someplace
else,
can
he?
he
can't
issue
any
order
to
a
citizen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
can
issue
orders
to
passengers
even
though
they
are
not
seized.
