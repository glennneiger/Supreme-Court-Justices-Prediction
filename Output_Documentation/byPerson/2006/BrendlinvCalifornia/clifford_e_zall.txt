mr.
clifford
e.
zall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
respond
if
i
could
to
justice
souter's
point
earlier.
the
state
sees
this
as
having
two
distinct
components
in
a
situation
where
a
passenger
is
subject
to
a,
in
a
vehicle
that's
subjected
to
a
routine
traffic
stop.
first,
you
have
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle,
the
physical
stopping
of
the
vehicle.
in
our
view
that
does
not
result
in
a
seizure
of
a
passenger.
it's
a
show
of
authority
much
like
hodari
d
discussed,
which
is
directed
at
the
driver.
the
driver
is
the
operator
of
the
vehicle.
when
the
driver
submits
to
that
show
of
authority,
under
this
court's
precedents
the
driver
is
seized.
the
passenger
is
not
seized.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
justice
scalia,
the
way
i'd
answer
that
question
is
to
say
yes
at
the
outset,
because
the
driver
is
in
control
of
the
vehicle.
by
necessity,
the
show
of
authority
to
stop
if
it's
done
in
a
routine
manner,
as
was
done
here,
is
directed
at
the
driver.
therefore--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--thank
you.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
justice
souter,
i
think
the,
the
pervasiveness
and
the
commonplace
nature
of
a
routine
traffic
stop
gives--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--yes.
yes,
i
have.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
but
i
was
the
driver,
i
was
the
driver.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
again,
because
the,
the
traffic
stop
is
such
a
common
occurrence
and
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
involving
a
routine
traffic
stop,
it's
an
investigatory
stop
of
the
driver.
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
the
passenger
and
the
driver
to
see
it
that
way,
i
would
submit
that
if
i
am
a
passenger
in
a
car
and
i'm
riding
with
somebody
and
they,
and
one
patrol
car
signals
for
the
driver
to
pull
over,
i
think
the
natural
reaction
is
the
driver
says,
what
did
i
do,
and
the
passenger
says,
what
did
you
do?
i
mean,
i
think
that's
the
natural
reaction.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
i
think
if
the
officer
did
tell
you
to
stay
in
the
car--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--well,
i,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
if,
if
the
officer...
our
position
is
that
if
the
officer
does
something
to
the
passenger
to
indicate--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--i'm
not
sure
that
a
passenger,
though,
is
like
a
suitcase.
i
mean,
a
suitcase
can't
go
anywhere
unless
somebody
does
something.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
though
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief,
justice
kennedy,
we
have
talked
with
the
california
highway
patrol
who
make
over
a
million
stops
a
year
in
california
and
they
treat
passengers
as
free
to
leave.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
i
mean...
but
i
think
that
prudent
behavior...
just
because
it's
prudent
to
do
something
doesn't
make
it
a
seizure.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
i
mean,
i
think,
i
think
again
that--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i'd
say
that,
you
know,
in
the
court's
seizure
jurisprudence
there
is
this
notion
of
a
consensual
encounter.
i
think
when
an
officer
approaches
a
citizen
on
the
street
there
is
always
the
apparent
authority.
the
apparent
authority
of
the
police
is
always
present.
the
police
always
have
the
factual
upper
hand,
if
you
were,
and
at
the
traffic
stop
is
no
different.
i
mean...
and
yet,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
when
the
police
approach
a
citizen,
ask
for
his
identification,
ask
for
his
cooperation,
even
if
the
police
follow
him
in
a
squad
car,
that
that's
a
consensual
encounter.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
but
that
would
be
a
reason
why
you
don't
get
out.
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
necessarily
to
do
with
the
police
coercion.
i
don't,
i
don't
think...
most
of
us
wouldn't
get
out.
but
that
doesn't
make
it
a
seizure,
just
like
most
of
us
would
cooperate
with
the
police
when
the
police
approach
us
on
the
street.
but
i
don't
think...
if
anything,
i
think
the
traffic
stop
is
less
ambiguous.
it's
clearer
that
the
police
are
not
interested
in
me
if
i'm
a
passenger.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
yes.
yes,
because
now
the
police
have
directed
action
at
him
and
in
that
situation
a
reasonable
person--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--the
authority?
yes,
but
i
mean,
i
think
the
police
always
have
some
degree
of
authority
over
us
in
any
encounter.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
it
depends,
justice
stevens.
i
think,
is
there
legal
authority?
i
mean,
i
think
police
always
have
the
factual
authority
and
i
think
that's
the
way
the
reasonable
person
looks
at
things.
i
don't
think
the
reasonable
person--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--i
don't
think
in
this
context
there
is.
i
mean,
certainly
in--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
no,
i
don't
think
so,
any
more
so
than
mr.
drayton
was
in
the
drayton
case,
where
his
compatriot
was
arrested
and
the
police
continued
to
engage
him,
and
this
court
found
that
that
was
a
consensual--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
i
think
that
in
this
court's...
to
be
consistent
with
this
court's
consensual
encounter
jurisprudence,
with
rodriguez,
with
royer,
with
drayton,
with
bostick--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--yes,
yes,
i
do,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
if--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--well,
again,
i
think,
though,
that
it's
a
question
of
seizable
versus
seized.
i
don't
think
just
because
the
police
have
some
authority
that
that
makes
you
seized.
i
mean,
if
the
police
see
a
citizen
jaywalking
that
person
is
not
arrested
because
the
police
have
the
authority
to
make,
to
arrest
him.
so
again
i
think,
i
think
that
the
seizure
occurs
when
the
police
exercise
some
authority
over
you.
i
just
think
the
traffic
stop
is
less
ambiguous.
it's
clear
that
the
traffic
stop
is
to
deal
with
the
driver,
whereas
in
the
street
encounter--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--then,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
it's
a
seizure
that
at
the
outset,
again
per
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
that
the,
the
driver
only
is
seized
at
the
outset,
but
then
once
the
police
make
it
clear
that
their
interest
is
with
the
passenger
then
the
passenger
would
not
feel
free
to
leave,
and
then
the
passenger
would
be
seized.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
yes,
i
think
it
would
sort
of
happen
instantaneously.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
so
they
direct
their
action,
they
direct
their
attention
at
the
passenger
at
the
outset.
yes,
then
i
would
say
the
driver
is
seized
by
the
stop,
and
then
right
immediately
the
passenger,
the
reasonable
passenger,
would
not
feel
free
to
leave
and
then
he
would
also
be
seized
at
that
point.
but
again,
i
harken
back
to
the
court's
consensual
encounter
jurisprudence.
it
seems
to
me
that
again
the
straight
encounter
is
more
anxiety-forming
for
the
citizen
because
the
police
have
directed
their
attention
at
you.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
ginsburg,
the
passenger
would
not
be
an
innocent
passenger
and
the
court's
test
presupposes
an
innocent
person.
so
we
can't
really
ask
the
question
from
the
perspective
of
the
seatbelt
violator.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
again,
i...
as
justice
souter
indicated,
i
think
you
have
to,
you
have
to
break
it
up.
at
the
outset,
the
show
of
authority
is
by
nature
of
the,
of
the
vehicle,
is
directed
at
the
driver.
after
the
vehicle
comes
to
a
stop,
the
police
could
manifest
some
interest
in
the
passenger
and
then
that
changes
things.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
the
perspective
must
be...
we
must
look
at
it
from
the
innocent
passenger
and
whether
the
innocent
passenger
would
as
a
result
merely
of
the
stop
of
the
car
feel
free
to
leave.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
again
i
think
factually
citizens
when
they
encounter
police
always
know...
i
mean,
the
policeman
in
any
encounter
is
armed,
is
typically
armed,
and
has
apparent
authority
over
you.
and
yet
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
that
in
and
of
itself,
although
it
may
cause
some
anxiety
on
the
part
of
citizen--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--but
justice
stevens,
again
i
don't
think
that
the
reasonable
innocent
passenger
is...
this
court
has
never
said
it's
the
reasonable
innocent
passenger
that
knows
the
supreme
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
by
heart.
i
mean--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--i
think
that
is
the
current
state
of
the
law.
yes,
that
is
the
current
state
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
that
just
suggests
that
you're
prudent
when
you're
dealing
with
an
armed
officer.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
again,
though,
that
the
stop
and
then
the
after
the
stop
are
discrete.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
i
think,
justice
breyer,
again
i
would
keep
coming
back
to
the
court's
consensual
encounter
jurisprudence.
i
think
you
could
ask
some
of
the
same
questions
about
in
the
drayton
case,
in
the
bostick
case,
in
the
royer
case.
but
if
you
accept
those
at
consensual,
then
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
any--
less
consensual
here.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
i
think
that
even
were
this
court
to
rule
that
the
passenger
were
subject
to
a
seizure,
that
the
presence
of
the
arrest
warrant
attenuates
any
taint
and
therefore
the
evidence
was...
was
not
suppressible.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
i
wouldn't,
i
wouldn't
think
there
would
be
a
need
to
send
the
case
back.
i
mean,
i
think--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--i
concede
that
that's
true.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
i
think
that
because
it's
fairly
clear
that
the
arrest
would,
would
remove
the
taint
from
the
seizure,
that
there
would
be
little
reason
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
well,
i
think
it's
subsumed
in
the
question
presented
and
i
think
it
was
raised
in
our
opposition
and
the
parties
have
briefed
it.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
that
is
correct,
but
again
i
think
because
the
warrant
is
such
a
clear
intervening
circumstance
that
has
nothing
to
do,
you
couldn't
in
any
way
say
it's
an
exploitation
of
the,
of
the
illegal
stop.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
certainly
you
could
take
that
position,
justice
souter.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
again,
that
it's
relatively
straightforward.
the
arrest
was
valid.
i
mean,
unquestionably
the
arrest
was
valid.
if
the
arrest
was
valid,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
are
any
cases--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree.
and
one
further
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
that
is,
would
be
to
draw
a
parallel
between
a
parked
car
situation,
in
which
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
no
seizure
results
when
the
police
turn
on
their
lights
and
approach
a
parked
car,
and
even
when
they
rap
on
the
window
to
get
the
attention
of
the
occupants
there
is
no
seizure.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
of
anybody.
lower
courts
have
uniformly
held
that,
and
yet
that
seems
to
be
a
more
ambiguous
situation
and
a
situation
in
which
the
occupants'
natural
reaction
would
be
to
turn
to
each
other
and
say:
what's
going
on
here?
whereas
again
in
the
traffic
stop
i
think
it's,
it
is
probably
the
most
likely
place
that
a
citizen
encounters
a
policeman,
much
more
so
than
a,
an
officer
approaching
me
at
an
airport
and
saying,
can
i
see
your
identification,
or
approaching
me
on
a
street
corner,
or,
as
in
chesternut,
following
me
as
i'm
walking
home
in
his
squad
car.
those
seem
to
me
to
be
more
anxiety-creating
and
yet
the
court
has
held
that
those
are
consensual
encounters.
and
in
the
parked
car,
there's
ambiguity
about
what
the
police
want,
whereas
in
the
routine
traffic
stop
there
isn't
that
ambiguity,
so
there's
no
reason
why
the
passenger
shouldn't
feel
free
to
leave.
now,
it
might
be
prudent,
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
to
say,
i'm
leaving.
but
that
doesn't
make
it
a
seizure,
that
you
should
act
prudently.
i
think
you
should
always
act
prudently
when
you're
dealing
with
the
police.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
that's...
that
right,
your
honor.
but
again
i
think,
so
i
think
it's
just
the
mere
presence.
it
would
just
be
from
the
time
that
he
got
out
of
his
parked,
of
his
car
after
he
parked
it,
and
then
with
his
lights
on
approached
the
car
and
then
looks
in
and
sees
mr.
brendlin.
so
that's
the
period
of
time
that
petitioner
would
have
to
establish
that
a
reasonable
person
would
not
feel
free
to
leave.
and
the...
and
the
comparison
with
the
parked
car
and
the
other
consensual
encounter
cases
of
this
court
in
my
view
indicate
that
there
is
nothing
that's
been
done
to
the
passenger.
i
mean,
the
arrest
of
one
person
as
this
court
said
in
drayton
does
not
mean
that
everyone
around
him
is
detained
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
the
state
that
anything
has
been
done
to
the
passenger.
he
just
was
unlucky
enough
to
be
in
this
car
when
the
driver
was
stopped
for
a
traffic
violation.
and
that
seems
to
me
fairly
unambiguous
and
we
don't
feel
like
a
reasonable
passenger
would
not
feel
free
to
leave
in
that
situation.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
justice
kennedy,
i
wouldn't
think
you're
distorting
the
law
of
seizure
by
saying
the
passenger
isn't
seized.
nothing
is
done
to
the
passenger.
he
happens
to
be
in
this
stopped
vehicle,
but
the
police
have
directed
no
action
toward
him
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
be
torturing
the
definition
at
all.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
yeah.
because
i
think...
because
i
think
the
weighty
interest
in
officer
safety
would
still
allow
the
officer
to
have
some
degree
of
control
over
the
situation.
but
again
seizable
does
not
mean
seized.
the
fact
that
the
officer
could
seize
the
passenger
doesn't
mean
that
the
passenger
is
seized.
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
but
again--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--but
justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
because
of,
the
court
recognized
in
mimms
and
in
wilson
that
there
is
something
inherently
dangerous
about
the
traffic
stop
situation,
and
there
may
be
weapons
in
the
car
that
the
officer
can't
see,
and
so
that's
why
this
court
found
in
wilson
that
you
could
order
the--
mr.

--i
don't
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
court
ever
indicated
that
the
passenger
was
seized
in
wilson
prior
to
the
order
out.
i
know
there
was
a
dissent
that
indicated
that
the
passenger
wasn't
seized
and
the
majority
never
indicated
that
they
disagreed
with
that
point.
i
think
that
what
happened
in
wilson
is
that
the
court
just
felt
that...
may
i--
mr.
clifford
e.
zall
--the
court
just
felt
that
the
weighty
interest
in
officer
safety
justified
the
order
out,
regardless
of
whether
the
passenger
was
seized
at
the
outset.
