justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
a
direct
product
of
the
arrest,
and
if
the
arrest
is
legal,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
is
legal.
and
are
you
acknowledging
that
the
arrest
is
legal,
that
whatever
the
exclusionary
rule
does,
it
does
not
require
you...
when
you've
engaged
in
an
unlawful
seizure
and
you
find
an
ax
murderer
sitting
there
in
the
car,
you
don't
have
to
say
sorry,
i
shouldn't
have
stopped
the
car.
you
can
arrest
the
person,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
arrest
is
legal.
if
the
arrest
is
legal,
then
the
search
incident
to
it
must
be
legal.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
car...
you
know,
the
car
doesn't
come
to
a
complete
stop.
the
same
facts
that
justice
breyer
just
gave
you.
it's
creeping
along
at,
you
know,
a
foot
a
minute.
and
then
he
says
to
these
other
people,
you
can
jump
out
and
go
wherever
you
like,
or
you
know,
or
go
back
to,
to
my
partner's
car.
then
they
wouldn't
have
been
stopped;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
putting
all
the
eggs
into
the
basket
that
the,
the
car
came
to
a
complete
stop
and
therefore
they
have
been
seized.
and
what
is
crucial
for
the
seizure
is
the
elimination
on--
motion
on
the
part
of
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
elimination
of
motion
in
a
vehicle
in
which
you
are
the
passenger
constitutes,
at
the
request
of
the
authorities,
constitutes
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
if
you're
still
rolling
a
little
bit,
a
foot
a
minute.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
shutdown
of
an
airport?
you
know,
there
is
word
that
somebody
has
been
seen
walking
in
with
a
bag
of
explosives
or
it
looks
like
a
bag
of
explosives,
so
they
stop
all
planes
on
the
tarmac,
shut
down
all
exits
to
the
airport
until
they
can
ascertain
what
this
bag
is.
everybody
in
the
airport
and
everybody
in
those
planes
has
been
seized
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
just
the
people
who
were
trying
to
leave
the
airport.
they
had
just
arrived
and
they
were
going
to
go
out
to
catch
a
cab
and
go
home.
they
have
been
seized.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
turns
out
that
there
wasn't
a
bag
of
explosives
and
that
no
reasonable
person
would
have
thought.
this
was
a
knitting
bag
and
some
foolish
cop
thought
it
was
a
bag
of
explosives.
that
would
have
made
it
unreasonable.
so
everybody
in
the
airport
who
is
on
the
way
home
has
been
seized
and
has
a
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
even,
even
when
the
reason
the
driver
is
stopped
is
that
a
police
officer
whose
car
was
alongside,
he
looks
over
there
and
he
sees
that
it
is
some
notorious
felon
who
is
in
the
back
seat,
and
the
only
reason
he
stops
the
car
is
so
arrest
that
felon?
you
would
still
say
that,
that
the
show
of
authority
is
only
directed
at
the
driver
and
hence
it
is
only
the
driver
that's
seized?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
right
answer.
i
think
you're
being
consistent.
you
have
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
the
truth
now.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
policeman
usually
tells
the
drive
and
anybody
else
in
the
car:
stay
in
the
car.
policemen
don't
like
people
jumping
out
of
the
car.
they
don't
know
why
they're
jumping
out
of
the
car.
and
i
would
certainly
if
i
were
a
passenger
not
feel
free
to
immediately
open
the
door
and
start
walking
away,
and
if
i
did
i
would
expect
the
policeman
to
tell
me:
get
back
in
the
car.
isn't
that,
isn't
that
the
normal
procedure,
to
keep
the
occupants
in
the
car
until
the
policeman
investigates?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
if
he
didn't
tell
me.
i
would
have
expected
him
to
tell
me.
i
wouldn't
even
open
the
door
because
i
know
he
would
tell
me.
i
know
that
i'm
not
free
to
leave
the
car
immediately
until
he
investigates
the
stop.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
never
pass
a
police
car.
i
don't
care
how
slow
i'm
going.
i
don't
consider
myself
arrested
just
because
that's
the
prudent
thing
to
do,
and
it
may
well
be
a
similar
situation
when
you're
sitting
in
a
car
that's
been
stopped
by
a
traffic
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
he
doesn't
have
actual
authority.
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
he
has
no
authority
to
stop
an
innocent
passenger
from
walking
away.
aren't
you
saying
that?
unless
there's
some
reason
to
hold
a
person
in
the
car,
he
has
no
authority
to
stop
him
from
walking
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
feel,
even
though
that's
the
current
state
of
the
law,
i
wouldn't
think
of
opening
the
door
and
walking
away
without
asking
the
policeman,
do
you
mind
if
i
open
the
door
and
walk
away?
does
that
suggest
that
i
think
i've
been
seized?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
can
just
pass
until
the
studies
are
done?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
have
we
done
in
a
case,
and
maybe
we
haven't
had
it,
but
what
have
we
done
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
warrantless
entry
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
somebody's
apartment,
and
there
is
a
suitcase
in
there
that
does
not
belong
to
the
owner
of
the
apartment?
my
impression
is
that,
that
the
owner
of
that
suitcase
has
not
been
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure;
is
that
correct?
