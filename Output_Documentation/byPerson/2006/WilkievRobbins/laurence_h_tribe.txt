mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
dramatic
contrast
between
the
instantaneous
judgments
a
school
principal
might
have
to
make
in
the
face
of
complicated
decisions
like
tinker,
and
a
deliberate
decision
over
a
course
of
almost
a
dozen
years
made
by
officials
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
the
greater
retaliate
against
someone
for
refusing
to
relinquish
his
property
to
the
government
without
any
compensation.
you
don't
have
to
have
taken
a
special
course
in
constitutional
law
to
know
that
that
is
clearly
forbidden.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
scalia,
that's
not
correct.
that
was
what
they
did
with
nelson,
his
predecessor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
and
what
happened--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
government
is
wrong.
it
continued.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
ran
with
the
land,
it
was
part
of
what
he
brought.
if
it
had
expired--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
right-of-way
over
the
government's
roads.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as...
that's
right.
the
right-of-way
over
the
road
of
access,
which
they
not
only
canceled
in
july
of
1985
but
refused
to
maintain
themselves,
so
that
he
couldn't
really
access
the
ranch.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
didn't
have
the
authority
to
cancel
it
simply
because
of
the
transfer
of
the
land.
they
allege
that
he
had
made
various
technical
violations
on
account
of
which
they
canceled
it.
but
the
key
point
is,
that
was
supposed
to
be
the
quid
pro
quo,
that
is,
they
have
maintained
all
along
that
this
case
is
about
that
right-of-way
and
what
an
ingrate
the
respondent
is
that
he
wants
to
continue
enjoying
it
and
not
give
the
easement.
well,
he
didn't
enjoy
it
after
july
of
1995
when
it
was
canceled.
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
cancel
it
for
alleged
violations.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
uh-huh.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
didn't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
wouldn't
either.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
to
cough
up
that
easement.
and
in
fact
when
he
said,
he
offered
to
negotiate,
and
the
immediate
response
from
mr.
vessels,
who
is
since
diseased,
was,
the
united
states
does
not
negotiate.
that
wasn't
just
kind
of
starting
of
a
bargaining
position.
they
dug
in
and
for
a
series
of
years
the
district
court
found,
fully
substantiated
on
the
petition
appellate
via...
appendix
to
the
petition
at
page
37a,
not
only
playing
hardball
and
being
selectively
tough
on
him,
but
a
number
of
clearly
illegal
acts,
breaking
into
his
lodge.
one
of
them
particularly
striking
to
me
at
joint
appendix
49
to
57,
inciting
a
neighbor
to
ram
a
truck
into
the
respondent
while
he
was
on
horseback.
firemen--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
are
remedies
one
by
one
for
each
of
these
acts.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
remedies
were
acquittal.
he
was
acquitted,
for
example.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
no.
they
didn't
think
he
did
do
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
alleged--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
part
of...
this
is
a
suite
like
hartman
v.
moore.
one
of
the
acts
that
is
clearly
actionable
under
bivens,
if
one
has
to
dissect
the
various
predicate
acts,
is
the
fact
that
without
probable
cause,
at
page
71
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
deliberately
fabricated
a
felony
charge.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
when
he
was
acquitted
of
that
by
a
jury
that
took
20
minutes,
and
said
that
they
were
outraged
by
the
blm,
they
found
other
things
to
do.
they
found
other
things--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--he
tried
to
do
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
won
some,
he
lost
some,
but
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
sure
do.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
breyer,
that...
that
floodgates
concern
was
addressed
by
this
court
not
long
enough
in
hartman
v.
moore
when
the
remedy
in
that
case
for
a
prosecution
that
was
brought
to
retaliate
against
someone
for
the
exercise
of
her
first
amendment
right
was
a
bivens
action
against
the
postal
inspectors
who
made
this
all
up.
now
the
court
there
addressed
the
possibility
that
this
would
unleash
a
flood
of
lawsuits,
and
it
said
that
over
the
past
quarter
century,
there
had
been
only
12
bivens
or
1983
actions
against
this
kind
of
retaliation.
i
suppose
that
is
because
not
that
many
postal
inspectors
or
blm
guys
think
they
can
get
away
with
deliberately
retaliating
against
people
for
exercising
their
rights.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
see,
but
it
was
present
in
davis,
davis
v.
passman,
to
which
justice
kennedy
referred,
already
recognized
a
bivens
action
for
violating
something
even
more
capacious,
due
process,
equal
protection.
when
this
court
said
in
village
of
willowbrook
against
oleck
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
even
for
the
naked
assertion
that
you're
treating
me
differently,
did
that
open
huge
floodgates?
have
we
been
flooded?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
developed
its
own
filters
against
the
floodgate
of
retaliation
claims.
it's
been--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
uh-huh.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
many
of
them
are
not,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
for
example,
shapiro
v.
thompson.
the
court
has
said
that
the
right
to
travel
cannot
be
penalized.
the
broad
point
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
hartman
v.
moore,
different.
what
we
were
answering
there
was
not
the
point
about
a
freestanding
cause
of
action.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
kennedy,
that
was
a
response
to
their
claim,
that
only
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
is
there
a
right.
this
was
not
the
bivens
question.
only
with
respect
to
the
fifth...
first
amendment
is
there
a
right
not
to
be
retaliated
against
for
the
exercise
of
your
rights.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
can
look
at
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
the
sense
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
just
like
it
under
hope
v.
pelzer,
there
doesn't
have
to
have
been
one
like
it.
but
we
do
think
that
there
is
a
compelling
case,
because
there's
no
other
way
to
enforce
the
just
compensation
right
against
a
group
of
government
agents
who
are
determined
to
pile
punishment
upon
punishment
until
someone
caves
in.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
the
retaliatory
pattern
that
there
is
no
remedy
for.
when
going--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
action
of
falsely
prosecuting
him
in
retaliation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
we
did
not
bring
a
malicious
prosecution
claim
for
that
felony
charge.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
have
been
against
federal
officials
and
that
would
have
been
then
transformed
unless
we
brought
it
under
bivens,
which
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
transformed
into
an
action
against
the
united
states
by
the
westfall
act.
that
is
all
of
these
attempts--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--for
that
one
event
from
the
united
states,
but
the
blm
agents
would
not
have
been
deterred.
in
any
event,
carlson
v.
green--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
the
most
important
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
justice
souter
and
mr.
chief
justice,
that
when
someone
says,
i
do
not
want
to
give
you
my
property,
you
have
to
take
it
from
me
and
give
me
just
compensation,
the
position
of
the
government
here
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
limit
on
the
kind
of
retaliation
they
can
engage
in.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
bivens
as
a
constitutional
tort
is
not
a
new
remedy.
the
question
really
is
whether
there
is
any
conceivable
basis
when
they
trash
his
lodge,
when
they
do
all
of
the
other
things,
for
treating
this
differently
from
another
kind
of
constitutional
violation.
i
mean,
they
argue
that
it's
very
important,
even
though
we
could
have
lots
of
people
bringing
unjustified
suits,
to
have
a
bivens
remedy
for
retaliation
against
free
speech.
the
reason
that
they
give
is
that
free
speech
is
easily
chilled.
but
with
property
rights
the
just
compensation
clause
is
kind
of
its
own
antifreeze.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
justice
breyer,
the
court
has
established
in
the
area
of
retaliation
against
people
for
the
exercise
of
their
rights,
title
vii
rights
in
burlington,
first
amendment
rights--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--hartman
is
not
statutory.
some
of
the...
hartman
is
the
first
amendment,
and
it's
the
bivens
case.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
about
that
is
that
the
court
has
a
body
of
law
trying
to
filter
out
through
requiring
proof
of
causation,
requiring
proof
of
substantial
injury,
filter
out
these
trivial
cases
where
someone
is
simply
making
a
nuisance.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
the
common
law
history,
justice
alito,
we
cited
two
cases
from
new
york,
the
whaley
case
in
1827
and
willett
in
1915.
and
it
was
that
body
of
new
york
law
from
which
the
hobbs
act
largely
drew.
those
were
cases
in
which
the
courts
said
that
the
fact
that
the
government
agent
is
extorting
property
for
his
own
employer
the
government
doesn't
make
any
difference;
it
is
still
extortion.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
are
plenty
of
cases,
justice
alito,
that
involve
extortion
for
one's
employer
where
the
employer
might
be
a
union
or
a
corporation
or
a
charitable
body.
but
it's
true
the
hobbs
act
has
not
been
applied,
in
my
research
anyway
i
have
not
seen
it
applied,
to
this
kind
of
extortion.
but
the
language
clearly
covers
it
and
the
language
of
rico
clearly
covers
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
librarian
thinks
that,
the
legislature
is
not
giving
us
enough
money,
so
i'm
going
to
deliberately
use
my
authority
to
get
an
extra
five
cents
from
everybody,
i
suppose
if
you
could
prove
willfulness,
which
is
an
important
element
of
hobbs,
and
if
there
were
several
librarians
and
there
was
a
pattern
and
you
could
establish
the
other
prerequisites
of
rico,
it
could
be
a
rico
violation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
second
case--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't,
i
don't
think
there
is,
justice
breyer,
and
it's
very
short.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
willett
versus
devoy,
it
involved
a
clerk
demanding
more
money
than
the
law
allowed,
and
the
court
said:
"no
distinction
is
made
on
the
ground
that
the
official
keeps
the
fee
or
turns
it
over
to
the
government.
"
"such
a
judge-made
restriction
on
the
general
statute
requiring
that
the
money
be
kept
by
the
individual
might
itself
bring
about
uncertainty,
confuse
and
possibly
great
injustice.
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
remember.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all,
when
you
keep
calling
it
a
reciprocal
agreement
it
does
trouble
me.
they
weren't
giving
him
anything
for
this
easement
which
they
had
already
extracted
from
his
predecessor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
they
were
trying
to
get
the
easement
for
nothing.
i
mean,
it's
very
much--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
most
of
what
they
did
would
not
have
been
an
okay
method
of
getting
a
reciprocal
easement,
anyway.
but
the
attempt
to
get
it
would
be
fine.
it's
not
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
reciprocal
easement.
that
might
have
been
a
problem
under
nollan
and
dolan
to
figure
out
whether
there
was
enough
connection,
but
i
think
there
would
have
been
enough.
the
problem
was
that
they
were
using
the
right-of-way,
which
was
long
gone,
as
an
excuse
to
get
an
invaluable
piece
of
property
that
they
had
no
right
to
get.
they
were
then
trying
to...
they
were
basically
saying,
and
they
made
it
explicit,
give
us
this
easement
for
nothing
or
we'll
bury
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
nor
would
nollan
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
they
weren't
trying
to
get
an
easement
in
return
for
something
which
wasn't...
which
you
called
extortion.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
guess
the
straightforward
answer
that
i
would
give
to
your
question
i
think
is
that
the
constitution
does
guarantee
that
the
government
cannot
take
your
property
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you've
certainly
done
it
with
respect
to
the
eighth
amendment.
you've
done
it
with
respect
to
speech.
you've
done
it
with
respect
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
kennedy,
if
it's
an
extension,
it's
i
think
implicit
in
bivens'
logic.
bivens
deals
with
the
cases--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
fifth
amendment
is
different
from
the
first,
but
is
it
different
in
a
relevant
way?
the
just
compensation
clause
does
give
the
government
an
incentive,
if
they
can
avoid
having
to
use
eminent
domain
and
tax
the
public,
gives
them
an
incentive
to
try
to
squeeze
property
out
of
somebody.
if
it
has
any
incentive
effect,
it's
one
that
points
to
the
need
for
a
bivens
remedy.
why
is
a
bivens
remedy--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
working
together
is
what
this
guy
tried
to
do
at
the
beginning.
he
said,
i'm
happy
to
negotiate.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
said:
we
don't
negotiate.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
on
those
very
instances
where
he
was
cited
with
trespass
others
who
were
doing
the
identical
thing
were
not.
and
the
ibla
has
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
ibla
rejected
them
because
it
said
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
was
at...
in
its
decision
at
170
ibla
in
2006.
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
whether
the
motive
was
retaliatory,
whether
it
was
unconstitutional,
whether
it
was
part
of
a
pattern.
and
this
court
has
said
that
one
can't
use
the
apa
in
that
way
either.
nor
could
an
injunction
be
used
to
get
a
pattern
like
this
because
of
rule
65d
and
international
longshoremen,
try
to
frame
an
injunction
saying:
don't
keep
trashing
this
guy
and
ruining
his
business
and
harassing
and
surveilling
his
guests
and
whatever
else
you
can
come
up
with
in
order
to
squeeze
his
property
out
of
him.
no
other
remedy
will
work.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
could
have
taken
that
one
item
and
under
a
decision
like
hartman
vindicated
it.
but
as
is
clear
from
the
way
he
tried
to
challenge
these
individual
things
and
then
concluded,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
taking
years
and
costing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
more
than
was
involved
in
each
individual
one,
that
was
hopeless.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
he
wouldn't
have
had...
because
he
would
have
had
no
record.
that
is,
the
review
under
the
apa
by
the
district
court
would
have
been
based
on
the
evidentiary
record
he
made.
and
the
ibla
specifically
ruled
that
it
would
not
entertain
evidence
about
the
reasons
that
the
blm
officials
had
for
going
after
him.
there
would
be
no
evidence
to
support
his
claim.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
in
reviewing
a
final
agency
action
is
limited
to
the
agency
record.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
so
a
challenge
to
the
ibla's
assertion--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
he
did
write
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
was
not
given
an
answer.
so
what
can
one
say?
the
district
court
decided...
lest
you
assume
that
because
he
wasn't
given
an
answer
he
doesn't
have
a
case,
the
district
court
said,
as
hard
as
it
is
to
prove
these
things,
he
has
substantial
evidence
that
they
were
picking
on
him
solely
to
get
the
property,
not
because
they
didn't
like
him,
not
for
some
other
reason;
they
were
trying
to
get
property
for
which
they
were
unwilling
to
pay.
it's
doubtful
that
they
could
have
taken
it
by
eminent
domain
because
the
laws
limiting
the
ability
of
the
blm
require
proving
necessity
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
suggesting
that
they
needed
this
easement.
there
is
plenty
in
the
record
suggesting
that
he
couldn't
access
his
own
property
as
long
as
the
roadway
wasn't
maintained
in
a
passable
condition,
and
one
of
the
ways
they
retaliated
against
him
was
to
refuse
to
maintain
the
roadway.
the
record
is
also
clear
that
his
business
suffered
greatly.
so
that
if
the
result
is
that
someone
who
is
trying
to
insist
that
if
you
want
my
property,
you
have
to
take
it
by
eminent
domain
and
give
me
just
compensation,
can't
get
help
in
those
other
ways,
this
is
crucial.
what
would
have
happened
in
kaiser
aetna,
if
when
the
government
said
we
think
we
have
an
easement
to
the
laguna
pond,
instead
of
going
to
court,
which
they
did
and
they
lost,
if
they
had
said
well
we
are
going
to
ram
our
motor
boats
or
invite
people
to
ram
their
motor
boats
into
your
sailboat?
we
are
going
to
ruin
your
business
in
the
kuapa
pond
until
you
give
the
public
an
easement.
only
a
bivens
cause
of
action
which
the
court
has
recognized
in
other
areas,
in
other
constitutional
claims...
due
process,
free
speech,
eighth
amendment...
only
a
bivens
cause
of
action
is
directly
responsive
to
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
westfall
act
makes
an
exception
when
you
are
making
a
constitutional
claim.
that
is,
in
1988
when
the
court
passed
the
westfall
act,
there
were
two
exceptions
2679b(2)(a)
and
(b)
were
constitutional
claims
and
statutory
claims.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
seems
to
me
that
state
tort
law
does
not
get
at
the
harm
that
he
has
suffered.
it
gets
at
each
individual
piece.
but
the
main
harm
he
suffered
is
that
they
are
circumventing
the
just
compensation
clause
as
the
one
way
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
designed
to
permit
the
government
to
get
property
for
public
use.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
