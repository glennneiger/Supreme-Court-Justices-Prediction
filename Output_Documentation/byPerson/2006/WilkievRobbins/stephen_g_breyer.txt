justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
surprised
you
say
piecemeal.
i
would
have
thought
most
agencies
in
the
government
have
like
an
inspector
general
or
someone
that
you
can
complain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
write
them
a
letter
and
you
say,
look
at
what's
been
going
on,
they've
been
trespassing,
they've
indicted
me
on
a
false
charge;
i
want
you
to
see
the
whole
list
here
and
i'd
like
you
to
do
something
about
it.
and
if
they
don't
do
anything
about
it,
you
go
to
your
senator.
maybe
you
can
go
to
the
newspapers.
i
mean,
has
any
of
that
happened
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
been
the
result
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
it
a
state
law
matter?
why
didn't
he
know
about
this
possibility?
why
didn't
he
know
that
his
predecessor
in
title
had
granted?
why
wasn't
there
an
actual
notice,
given
the
fact
that
everybody
in
this
area
of
the
country
seems
as
a
matter
of
course
to
give
mutually
beneficial
rights-of-way?
i
agree
it
wasn't
recorded.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
this
case
were
identical,
everything's
the
same,
except
that
the
officials
involved
are
state
officials,
would
there
be
a
1983
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different...
that's
a
different
reason.
that's
a
merits
defense.
i
just
wondered
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
you're
saying
there
is
no
bivens
action,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
even
thinking
of
it.
i
just
wonder
if
1983
would
apply
and
it
would
be
clear
that
there
is
an
action.
if
you
win,
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
would
have
thought...
wait.
when
you
say
that,
i
mean,
there's
a
lot
of
these
acts,
it
seems,
they
are
plainly
illegal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
they
are
plainly
illegal,
then
there
are
remedies
in
the
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
what
is
actually
worrying
you,
which
probably
you
can
address
at
some
point,
is
this:
there
are
remedies
one
by
one.
that's
true.
and
each
has
one.
and
maybe
you
can
even
get
injunctions
against
harassing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
he
didn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
it
may
be,
they
thought
he
did
do
it
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
bring
a
suit
for
malicious
prosecution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
he
should
have
won.
what's
worrying
me
throughout,
if
you
want
to
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
[laughter]
what
is
worrying
me
throughout
is,
put
this
case
to
the
side.
if
the
court
recognizes
what
i
take
it
has
not
happened
in
the
past,
that
there
is
an
action
for
private
people
to
bring
against
the
government,
bivens,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
all
of
a
sudden
vast
numbers
of
regulations,
the
coal
pillars
in
holmes
case,
everything
south
of
that
will
be
suddenly
in
federal
court
as
people
claim
that
what's
going
on
with
this
regulation
is
there
are
individuals
in
the
government
who
have
gone
too
far,
and
they
are
just
trying
to
get
my
property
and
the
use
of
it,
without
paying
a
fair
price.
now
by
the
way,
sometimes
people
in
government
do
go
too
far,
so
many
of
those
claims
might
have
some
justification.
but
suddenly
i
see
the
possibility
of
this
kind
of
action
becoming
a
major
roadblock,
an
obstacle
sometimes
used
unjustifiably,
and
not
necessarily,
not
necessary,
this
kind
of
thing,
to
impose
a
roadblock
to
totally
legitimate
government
regulatory
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
part
of
what's
worrying
me
is
that
once
you
get
into
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is...
prevents
the
government
from
taking
property
for
a
public
use
without
just
compensation,
the
possibility
of
the
legal
imagination
becomes
endless.
because
every
time
a
person
walks
across
the
doorstep,
every
time
a
person
wants
to
install
a
pipe
in
the
basement,
read
the
meter...
i
mean,
i
can
see
possibilities
of
actions
of
this
kind
arising,
and
particularly
when
the
government
wants
to
buy
it
and
is
pointing
out
all
the
reasons
why
it
should
be
sold.
is
there
a
threat
lurking
in
that
conversation?
you
see
what
i'm
worried
about
here,
which
wasn't
present
in
the
other
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
reason
would
be
probably
that
the,
if
you
can
make
a
comparison.
the
number
of
government
actions
that
affect
criminal
charges
and
so
forth
are
tiny
compared
to
the
number
of
governmental
actions
that
affect
people's
property.
virtually,
i
mean
the
number
of
government
actions
affecting
how
people
use
their
property,
it's
the
whole
series
of
law
books.
it
fills
the
room.
and
suddenly
to
open
up
a
new
remedy
in
that
kind
of
thing
is
what's
frightening
me,
which
is
what
i
said
already.
so
you
don't
have
to
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
retaliation,
what
is
retaliation?
isn't
retaliation
statutory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
two
cases
you
cite,
the
first
one
is
the
person
who
was
charged
with
extortion
is
a
judge--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
was
extorted
on
the
ground
that
he
told
the
plaintiff
to
pay
the
defendant,
so
the
money
wasn't
given
to
the
government.
so
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
difference.
and
then
the
second
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
may
have
been,
but
you
say
"see
also",
which
is
a
sign
to
me
there's
something
wrong
with
that
case.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
surprised
that
you
didn't
put
it
first
if
there
wasn't.

justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
you
say
"see
also"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
you
can
go
to
an
agency
and
say,
agency
i
want
to
do
such
and
such,
dah
dah
dah,
here
are
my
reasons.
agency
says
no.
i
want
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
you
might
have
written
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior:
secretary,
i
want
to
you
do
such
and
such,
please.
no.
okay,
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
happened?
