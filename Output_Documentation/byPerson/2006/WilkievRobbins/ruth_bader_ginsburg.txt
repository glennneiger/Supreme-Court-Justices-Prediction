justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
garre,
there's
a
record
here
that
the
district
court
said
there
was
substantial
evidence,
enough
to
go
to
trial,
of
a
pattern
of
harassing
conduct
that
included
trespasses
on
this
man's
lodge
and
leaving
the
place
in
disarray,
videotaping
the
guests,
selective
enforcement
of
the
grazing
laws,
a
whole
pattern
of
things,
even
asking
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
impound
his
cattle?
this
man
says,
this
has
been
done
to
me
by
officers
of
my
government.
is
there
a
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is,
what
is
there
that
will
really
be
effective,
because
if
you
tell
me
challenging
each
citation
for
violating
the
grazing
permit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
the
behavior
will
continue
and
he'll
get
one
more
and
one
more
and
one
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
that's
exactly
what
he
alleged
and
he
said,
and
it
happened
for
over
a
five-year
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
one
aspect
of
the
videotaping
his
guests,
that
the
government
was
doing
it
on
its
own
land,
on
public
land.
they
had
cameras
and
the
cameras
were
stationed
so
they
weren't
trespassing,
they
were
just
making
the
guests
feel
uncomfortable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
really
like
to
have
your
answer
to
my
opening
question,
and
i
said:
if
your
only
answer
is
each
time
something,
he
is
charged
by
the
blm
people,
he
goes
one
at
a
time,
engaging
a
lawyer,
spending
a
lot
of
time,
but
it
was,
one
of
the
briefs
called
it,
dying
a
thousand
deaths.
he
doesn't
want
that.
he
wants
to
say:
stop,
stop
this
whole
pattern;
not
one
citation;
stop
this
whole
pattern.
how
does
he
get
that
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does,
what
does
he
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
made
that,
who
made
that
determination,
including
the
selective
citations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
department
of
interior
reached
a
settlement
agreement
in
which
they
told
the
line
people
at
blm
to
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nonetheless,
they
did
enter
a
settlement
which
included
that
this
behavior
was
going
to
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
agree
at
least
to
a
minimum
that
we
must
accept
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding
that
what
the
complaint
alleged,
and
what
the
district
court
said
on
summary
judgment,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
a
trial.
that
that's
true.
so
we
have
to
accept
his
allegations
that
there
were
selective
citations
for
violations
of
grazing...
grazing
laws,
that
they
broke
into
his
lodge
and
messed
the
place
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
so
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that's
the
case
we
have.
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
only
remedy
a
citizen,
assuming
the
truth
of
those
allegations,
is
to
fight
these
actions
one
by
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
he
get
injunctive
relief?
you
said
something
about,
that,
you
said
they
may
seek
to
enjoin
conduct
that
they
claim
will
amount
to
an
uncompensated
taking.
can
he
have
this
litany
of
things
that
have
happened
and
go
into
a
court
and
say
court,
enjoin
those--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
can
bring,
he
can
bring
this,
he
could
bring
this
not
one
action
at
a
time,
but
he
could
complain
all
at
once
about
everything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
could...
he
could
not
go
into
a
federal
court
with
a
federal
question?
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
initial
decision
maker,
then
the
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's
what
his
predecessor
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
given
in
the
record.
the
record
is
that
he
was
not
on
notice.
so
whether
one
says,
gee
that's
unlikely
if
he
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it's
trying
to
cover
for
its
own
sloppiness
or
carelessness
in
not
recording--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
against
the
united
states.
it's
not
against
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
also
lost
the
malicious
prosecution
suit,
didn't
he?
didn't
he
bring
a
malicious
prosecution
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
lost.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
something
about
nelson
having
assigned
his,
the
right-of-way
that
he
had
to
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
it
wasn't
that
it
was
a
new
assignment;
it
was
the
former
owner
assigned
it
and
the
bla...
blm
approved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
prior
owner
did
assign
it.
the
stopper
was
the
blm.
