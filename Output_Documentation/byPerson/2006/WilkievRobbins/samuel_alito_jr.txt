justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
tribe,
could
i
ask
a
question
about
the
rico
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
until
i
read
this
case,
i
had
never
come
across
the
concept
that
a
government
employee
can
be
guilty
of
extortion
by
demanding
money
for
the
government
and
your
brief
didn't
cite
very
much
authority
for
this
anywhere
in
the
history
of
extortion.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
a
lot
of,
that's
not
a
lot
of
authority,
considering
the
long
history
of
extortion,
just
two
old
new
york
cases.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
you
have
a
librarian
in
a
courthouse
and
the
librarian
is
charging
lawyers
25
cents
a
page
for
photocopies,
but
there's
some
library
rule
that
says
the
fee
is
supposed
to
be
10
cents
a
page.
now
is
that,
is
that
a
rico?
