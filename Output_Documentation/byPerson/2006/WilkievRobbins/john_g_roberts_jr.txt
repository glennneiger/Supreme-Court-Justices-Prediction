chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-219,
wilkie
versus
robinson.
general
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
needs
a
little
upcranking.
good.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
any
of
these
administrative
actions
found
to
be
unfounded?
in
other
words,
did
he
win
any
of
the
trespass
citations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i...
i
think
part
of
what's
happening
here
is
there
is
difference
between
the
regulation
on
the
books
and
how
they
are
enforced.
just
as
a
hypothetical,
let's
say
they
don't...
the
government
doesn't
get
its
reciprocal
easement
that
it
wants,
and
so
it
says
look,
we
normally
don't
strictly
enforce
these
cattle
trespass
things,
but
we
are
going
to
go
by
the
book
with
this
guy
until
he
gives
us
the
right-of-way.
every
time
his
cattle
cross
over
the
line
we
are
going
to
hit
him
with
a
trespass
citation.
they
don't
do
it
for
anybody
else
but,
they're
going
to
do
it
for
him
because
they
want
to
get
the
reciprocal
right-of-way.
is
that
appropriate
or
inappropriate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
he
can't...
but
you're
saying
his
remedy
is
to
challenge
each
one.
but
actually
each
one,
his
cattle
did
trespass,
so
he
doesn't
have
a
good
case.
it's
just
that
out
in
the
west
they
don't
actually
give
citations
every
time
a
cow
crosses
the
river.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
suggesting
they
would
not
be
immune
from
a
state
law
trespass
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
finally
canceled
it,
how
did
it...
i
mean,
if
it
runs
with
the
land,
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
cancel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say...
you
call
it
punishment,
but
in
fact
the
government's
position
on
each
of
these
particulars
has
generally
been
vindicated.
when
your
client
has
appealed,
they've
upheld
the
trespass
citations.
when
you've
sued
for
malicious
prosecution,
the
suit's
been
rejected.
which
of
the
government
actions
do
you
not
have
an
existing
remedy
for,
apart
from
the
racketeer
and
corrupt...
rico
act
or
the,
this
new
bivens
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
point
to
any
one
governmental
action
for
which
you
do
not
have
an
existing
remedy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
a
malicious
prosecution
claim
for
that.
you
brought
that,
you
lost.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
have
brought
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
position
of
the
government
were
more
fairly
represented
they
would
say,
we
don't
want
everyone
to
be
able
to
claim
that
everything
we're
doing
under
color
of
law
is
retaliation,
because
then
we'll
hear
that
against
irs
agents,
we'll
hear
it
against
osha
agents.
so
long
as
you...
and
their
position
is
you
have
a
remedy
for
everything
you're
complaining
about,
and
you
invoked
some
of
them
and
you
lost,
you
didn't
invoke
others
and
so
you
didn't
prevail.
but
don't
create
a
whole
new
remedy
just
because
you're
dissatisfied
with
having
to
pursue
each
one
individually.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
this
clearly
establishes.
are
the
blm
folks
supposed
to
have
known
about
willett
versus
devoy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
clearly
establishing
their
liability
for
what
you
call
extortion?
i'm
sure
what
they
would
call
trying
to
save
the
taxpayers
money
and
getting
the
type
of
reciprocal
agreement
with
this
landowner
that
they
have
got
with
thousands
of
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
if
the
case
were
otherwise...
and
i
gather
we
have
a
factual
dispute
on
that...
that
it
would
have
been
all
right?
i
mean,
if
he
didn't
have
this
other
easement
already,
but
they
were
trying
to
negotiate
it,
that
this
type
of
playing
hardball,
i
guess
is
one
way
to
put
it,
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get,
to
see
if
you
agree
with
that.
in
other
words,
everything
about
this
case
would
otherwise
be,
i'm
sure
not
breaking
the
laws,
but
otherwise
it
would
be
all
right
if
they
were
trying
to
get
a
reciprocal
easement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
are
they
disabled
from
negotiating?
if
they
go
up
to
somebody
and
say,
you
know,
we'd
really
like
a
right-of-way
because
we
have
some
interest
in
lands
that
we
need
to
maintain
on
the
other
side,
and
the
person
says,
no
and,
you
know,
get
off
my
property,
do
they
have
to
shrug
their
shoulders
and
say
all
right?
or
can
they
say,
well,
you
know,
we're
neighbors,
we
have
a
lot
of
interests
in
common
and
we
should
work
together?
is
that
all
of
a
sudden
extortion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
many
trespass--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--citations
for
his
cattle
does
it
take
before
it's
all
of
a
sudden
extortion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he
challenged
the
citations
and
they
were
rejected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
a,
an
action
against
the
government
for
ramming
your
sailboat
is
directly
responsive
to
that.
you
get...
you
get
full
recovery.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
need
the
constitution
to
the
sue
the
government
for
ramming
your
sailboat.
basic
state
tort
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
answer.
(a
little
laughter.
)--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre,
you
have--
four
minutes
remaining.
rebuttal
argument
of
gregory
c.
garre,--
for
petitioners--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
why
did
you
revoke
it
later,
if
it
wasn't
valid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
their
argument
is
broader.
it
says
you
can't
look
at
each
little
piece.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
overall
structure,
and
overall
they
are
doing
it
to
extort
a
property
right
they
don't
want
to
pay
for,
and
they
are
not
doing...
other
people's
cattle
cross
over
and
they
don't
prosecute
them.
now,
let's
assume
that's
correct
on
the
facts.
are
you
saying
that
they
have
no
remedy
for
that
type
of
extortionate
activity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
