mr.
garre,
could
you
crank
up
the
thing?
the
sound
isn't
working,
i
don't
think,
mr.
garre.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
be
wrong,
too.
they
may
have
been
as
much
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
as
the
officers
who
conducted
it.
and
there
are
indeed
those
in
the
west
who
think
that
the
blm
does,
does
act
quite
arbitrarily
and
high-handedly
and
is,
is
upheld
by,
by
the,
the
administrative
courts.
now,
if
that's
a
problem,
what's
the
solution
to
that
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
one
by
one.
every
time
there
is
another
trespass
he
has
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
administrative
procedure
and
then
when
the,
when
the
administrative
court
says,
well,
it
was
okay,
then
he
has
to
go
through
the
regular
federal
courts.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
a
realistic
remedy,
not
for
somebody
who
claims
he's
being
systematically
harassed
for
five
years
as,
as
is
the
claim
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
assume
that
at
all.
even
if
they,
even
if
they
succeed,
they
say,
yes,
you're
right,
they
trespassed,
good
for
you.
i
mean,
what
is
the
remedy
if
they
did
trespass?
what
administrative
remedy
does
he
obtain.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
the
photographing
of
his
guests
who
he
brings
onto
his
ranch
to
hunt
and
they
pay
him
for
that.
and
then
he
claims
that
the
blm
follows
them
just
to
harass
them,
just
taking
photographs.
what
relief
could
he
get
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
they
wasn't
trespassing.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
damages
would
you
get
for
the
trespass
of
a...
one,
one
blm
agent
on
your
land?
a
lot
of
money
you're
going
to
get
for
that?
would
it,
would
it
come
anywhere
close
to
reimbursing
you
for
the
lawyers'
fees
that
it's
taken
to
go,
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
say
it
deprived
him
of
his
property
which
is
his
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
saying
it's
a
trespass;
get
off
my
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
part
of
his
claim
is...
is
selective
enforcement.
you
know,
maybe
he
did
trespass,
maybe
some
of
his
cattle
did
stray
on
somebody's
land.
but
they
are
beating
on
him
because
of
what
they
say
is
his
failure
to
give
a
reciprocal
easement
which
the
government
is
entitled
to.
to
what
extent
was
any
of
the
administrative
approval
of
the
blm
agents'
actions,
to
what
extent
was
that
based
on
the
legitimacy
of
seeking
to
extract
this
reciprocal
easement
from
him?
because
i
don't
see
that
it's
legitimate
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
because
the
government
was
entitled
to
the
reciprocal
easement?
is
that
why
they
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
extortion
because
he
should
have
given
the
easement.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
after,
not
after
they
have
already
given
away...
i
mean,
yes;
they
could
come
to
him
anew
and
say
i'll
tell
you
what,
if
you
give
us
this
easement
we'll
give
you
yet
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
had
one
in,
from
the
past,
which...
which
his
predecessor
had
given
a
reciprocal
easement
for,
and
the
government
failed
to
record
the
easement
and
therefore
was
is
deprived
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
mad
at
him
for
not
giving
back
that
easement
which
they
failed
to
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
reciprocal.
what
was
the
government
offering
to
give
him
in
exchange
for
his,
his
reaffirming
the
prior
easement
that
they
had
failed
to
record?
what
was
the
government
giving
him
in
exchange?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
that
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
did
not...
i
did
not
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
a...
including,
you
know,
busting
into
his
lodge
and
disrupting
the
furniture
and
all
of
that,
they
thought
that
that
was
probably--
justice
antonin
scalia
--probably
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
test
for...
for...
for
qualified
immunity?
you
have
to
know...
not
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
enough
to
know
that
your
action
was
wrongful?
you
have
to
know
the
particular
statute
or
constitutional
provision
under
which
a
remedy
would
be
sought?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tribe,
can
i
get
something
straight?
is
it
indeed
correct
that
what
the
government
was
seeking
here
was
an
exchange
of
easements,
that
the
government
was
going
to
give
one
and
your
client
would
give
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
the
predecessor
in
interest
of
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
what
the
government
gave
to
your
predecessor
of
interest,
did
that
easement
continue?
the
government
has
just
said
that
it
expired.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
i
understood
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
whether
it
was
canceled,
but
i
must
say,
if
they
were
just
seeking
a
fair
exchange
of
reciprocal
easements,
which
landowners
do
all
the
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
system
of
lands
out
there
can't
work
without
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
see
anything
terribly
wrong
about
the
blm
people
say
okay,
he
wants
to
play
hardball,
he
wants
to
play
by
the
book,
we'll
play
by
the
book.
what
would
be
wrong
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--see,
i
wouldn't
feel
bad
about
that
if
they
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
god,
every
time
his
cows
trespass,
we're
going
to
get
him.
every
time
his
hunting
expeditions
go
on
public
land,
we're
going
to
get
him.
that
would
seem
reasonable
to
me.
so
it
really
is
crucial
to
my
view
of
the
case
that
the
government
was
not
seeking
a
new
exchange,
it
was
seeking--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
him
to
cough
up--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
if
you
would
have
succeeded,
you
would
have
been
compensated.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tribe,
i'll
tell
what
you
troubles
me
about
this
case.
there
are
overzealous
government
agents.
there
always
have
been
and
i
am
sure
that,
assuming
all
of
the
misbehavior
described
here
is
correct,
i'm
sure
it
is
not
the
first
time
this
has
happened.
government
agents
sometimes
get
overzealous.
but
why
should
there
be
this
extraordinary
remedy
when
the
overzealousness
happens
to
be
attached
to
a
desire
to
get
a
piece
of
land,
whereas
if
they
had
just
picked
on
this
guy
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
he
combed
his
hair
or
for
any
other
reason
and
had
done
the
same
things
you
wouldn't
have
your
bivens
action,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
if
they
were
trying
to
get
some
other
property
for
it
or,
or,
or
money
for
it,
it
didn't
turn--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
whole
spectrum
of
possible
government
misbehavior,
selective
enforcement,
the
whole
spectrum,
the
only,
the
only
times
we're
going
to
allow
a
cause
of
action
under
bivens
or
under,
under
not
1983...
yes...
the
only
times
we're
going
to
do
that
is
when
there
is
a
demand
for
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
might
have
been
lying--
about
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
as
they
lied
about--
a
lot
of
other
stuff,
according
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
wouldn't
there
be
an
assignment?
why,
why
would
the
prior
owner
have
any...
any
interest
in
not
assigning
it?
