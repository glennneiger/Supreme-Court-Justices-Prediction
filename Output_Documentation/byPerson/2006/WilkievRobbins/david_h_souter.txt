justice
david
h.
souter
but
respect
to
the
rico
claim,
assuming
the
rico
claim
is
upheld,
what
do
you
say
to
your
brother's
argument
that
there
is
no
history
of
qualified
immunity
for
rico
claims?
that
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
addresses
the,
the
kind
of
development
of
squishier
law
under...
under
1983.
so
that
you
simply
have
not
qualified
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
that
may
be
a
very...
it
seems
to
me
that
those
may
be
good
arguments,
or
at
least
relevant
arguments
against
the
applicability
of
rico
in
the
first
place.
but
if
rico
is
found
to
have
been
violated,
i
take
it
it
would
be
an
extension
of
qualified
immunity
jurisprudence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to,
to
apply
it
to
a
rico
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
the
easement
over
the
roadway.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
opposed
to
the
grazing
easement.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
theory
of
the
tort
claims
act
is
that
if
the
government
is
paying
out
of
the
treasury,
it's
going
to
see
to
it
that
its
employees
don't
continue
to
commit
the
tort.
so
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
you
can
make
the
argument
that
it
would
have
had
no
effect
on
the
improper
behavior.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you
saying
that
there
was
therefore
no
way
short
of
bivens
even
to
challenge
or
even
to
vindicate
his
claim
of
selective
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
appreciate
that,
but
i
thought
you
made
the
further
claim...
maybe
i
misunderstood
it...
that
if
he
had
gone
from
the
administrative
tribunal,
or
attempted
to,
to
get
into
the
district
court,
he
could
not
have
gotten
into
district
court
under
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
he
have
gone
into
the
district
court
and
said,
i
tried
to
make
a
record
but
they
wouldn't
let
me;
let
me
make
a
record
now?
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that...
that
you
simply
cannot
follow
that
logic
ultimately,
because
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
the
sort
of
the,
you
know,
the
death
by
a
thousand
cuts,
which
is
what
they
are
claiming
here,
you
can
stitch
up
every
cut,
but
by
the
time
you
get
to
a
thousand,
you're
dead.
i
mean,
they're
making
an
argument
that
this
is
quantitatively
so
different
that
it
is
qualitatively
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
a
reasonable
assumption
in
response
to
their
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner
robbins
purchased
a
ranch
in
wyoming
that
comprises
a
patchwork
of
land
parcels
intermingled
with
tracts
belonging
to
other
private
owners,
the
state
of
wyoming
and
the
federal
government.
robbins’s
predecessor
had
granted
the
federal
government
an
easement
to
use
and
maintain
a
road
running
through
the
ranch
in
exchange
for
a
right-of-way
across
federal
lands.
but
robbins
took
title
free
of
the
easement
because
the
government
never
recorded
it.
when
the
government
realized
its
error,
it
asked
robbins
to
regrant
the
easement
that
he
declined.
robbins
alleges
that
the
defendants
who
are
current
and
former
officials
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
engaged
in
a
campaign
of
harassment
and
intimidation
to
force
him
to
regrant
the
easement.
robbins's
difficulties
with
the
bureau
can
be
divided
into
four
rough
categories.
torts
and
tort-like
injuries
to
him
such
as
trespass
on
his
property,
charges
brought
against
him
including
land-use
citations
and
two
criminal
charges,
which
he
was
ultimately
acquitted.
unfavorable
agency
action
such
as
the
cancellation
of
permits
to
use
government
land
and
in
the
fourth
category
a
few
other
miscellaneous
unfold
events.
robbins
claims
is
relevant
here
that
the
defendants
have
used
their
regulatory
powers
to
harass,
punish
and
crust
him
and
giving
the
government
its
property
without
payment.
robbins
brings
in
action
the
damages
under
the
theory
of
easiness
against
six
unknown
federal
narcotics
agents.
in
a
claim
under
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
or
rico.
the
defendants
filed
summary
judgment
motions
on
qualified
immunity
grounds,
which
the
district
court
ultimately
denied.
on
interlocutory
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
then
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reverse.
we
first
hold
that
robbins
has
no
cause
of
action
under
the
bivens
to
pursue
his
fifth
amendment
claim.
although
robbins
had
administrative
and
judicial
remedies
for
virtually
all
of
his
injuries,
pursuing
these
individually
might
not
amount
to
an
adequate
remedy,
because
it
would
subject
him
to
as
he
put
it,
death
by
thousand
cuts.
while
robbins
makes
a
good
case
that
his
injuries
should
be
addressed
collectively.
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger,
we
consider
the
difficulty
in
defining
workable
cause
of
action
under
bivens.
unlike
most
retaliation
claim,
robbins’s
claim
cannot
be
resolved
simply
by
determining
whether
the
government
officials
set
an
impermissible
objective
or
motive.
since,
all
parties
involved
here
can
see
that
the
government
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
pursuing
an
easement.
just
like
any
other
landowner
the
government
is
entitled
to
negotiate
and
it
can
be
either
more
or
less
giving
the
land-use
violations
depending
on
whether
a
neighbor
like
robbins
agrees
to
grant
it
the
easement
that
it
wants.
robbins’s
case
was
therefore
boiled
down
to
whether
the
defendants
went
too
far
and
demanded
too
much.
we
think
that
the
too
much
standard,
we
would
need
to
devise
would
be
an
unreliable
guard
to
conduct
and
to
liability.
nor
does
it
help
robbins
to
look
at
the
claim
more
abstractly
as
a
claim
for
retaliation
against
a
property
owner
seeking
to
enforce
its
rights.
so,
this
would
sweep
in
a
wide
variety
of
claims
of
overzealous
government
enforcement,
each
one
of
which
would
be
susceptible
of
the
too
much
problem
that
we
identify.
on
the
whole,
we
think
it
would
be
best
to
allow
congress
to
decide
whether
to
create
a
damages
remedy
in
a
conflict
like
this.
we
further
hold
that
robbins
has
no
cause
of
action
under
rico,
because
defendants
have
not
committed
the
predicate
act
of
extortion,
which
the
hobbs
act
and
in
turn
rico
defines
as
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
the
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence
or
fear
or
under
color
of
official
right.
the
question
is
whether
extortion
in
composite
situations
where
a
government
employees
seeks
to
obtain
property
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
national
government
rather
than
for
a
private
beneficiary,
because
the
hobbs
act
is
silent
in
this
point,
we
consult
common
law
meaning
of
the
term
extortion
under
color
of
official
right.
in
common
law,
extortion
by
a
public
official
was
the
rough
equivalent
of
what
we
would
now
describe
as
taking
a
bribe.
but
the
crime
of
extortion
focused
on
the
harm
of
public
corruption,
by
the
sale
of
public
favors
for
private
gain,
not
on
the
harm
caused
by
overzealous
efforts
to
obtain
property
on
behalf
of
the
government.
robbins
does
not
cite
and
we
are
not
aware
of
any
court
decision
in
the
60
years
since
the
hobbs
act
passage
that
found
extortion
and
efforts
of
government
employees
to
get
property
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
government.
we
have
some
affirmative
indication
from
congress
we
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
hobbs
act
was
intended
to
expose
all
federal
employees
to
extortion
charges
whenever
they
stretch
and
trying
to
enforce
government
property
claims.
the
conduct
that
robbins
alleges
falls
outside
the
traditional
definition
of
extortion
and
his
rico
claim
therefore
cannot
proceed
because
neither
bivens
nor
rico
gives
robbins
a
cause
of
action.
we
have
no
case
in
to
enquire
further
into
the
merits
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim
where
the
asserted
defensive
qualified
immunity.
