mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
asks
this
court
to
recognize
a
new
constitutional
tort
under
bivens
and
the
just
compensation
clause--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--hopefully
that's
better.
--recognize
a
new
constitutional
tort
under--
bivens
and
the
just
compensation
clause
that
would
subject
public
officials
to
personal
liability
for
conduct
that
he
concedes
does
not
amount
to
a
taking.
recognizing
that
constitutional
tort
would
require
this
court
to
extend
bivens
to
an
entirely
new
context,
it
would
disregard
limits
that
have
existed
for
centuries
on
just
compensation
clause
claims,
and
it
would
skew
the
enforcement
of
important
public
land
use
objectives
and
thereby
threaten
public
resources
and
public
lands.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
a
number
of
avenues
that
he
could
have
sought
to
prevent
this
alleged
conduct
and
that
he
did
invoke.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
remedy
under
bivens
or
an
inferred
action
under
the
just
compensation
clause.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
can
challenge
the
citations
for
challenging
the...
canceling
the
grazing
permits--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
reasonable
inference,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
the
ibla
considered
and
rejected
each
of
the
alleged
administrative
actions
on
which
his
claim
is
now
based.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
our
position
is
that
he
hasn't
established
a
constitutional
tort
or
an
actionable
claim
under
rico.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
to
answer
your
question,
the
government
takes
these
types
of
allegations
seriously.
it's
taken
seriously
at
the
line
level
at
the
bureau
of
land
management.
it's
taken
seriously
within
the
department
of
interior
and
it's
taken
seriously
at
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
we
know
from
the
decisions
of
the
ibla
that
he
did
challenge
that
they
rejected
the
grounds
that
he--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
justice
scalia,
to
bring
an
apa
action
to
federal
court
challenging
the
final
decisions
of
the
ibla.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
again,
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
his
claims
would
not
succeed
either
at
the
administrative
level
or
at
the
apa
level,
and
if
he
got--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
if
there's
a
trespass
he
can
go,
he
can
obtain
an
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
a
trespass
is
an
unauthorized
taking.
that's
the
way
that
this
court
has
treated
it
1952
in
the
hasselly
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
he
claimed
that
they
were
trespassing
on
his
lands.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
he'd
raised
that
objection
before
the
ibla
and
the
ibla
concluded,
and
we
think
reasonably,
that,
given
the
history
of
the
disputes
with
this
individual,
given
his
litigious
nature,
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
blm
officials
who
were
out
there
to
be
documenting
his
trespasses
on
public
lands,
and
that's
an
important
dimension
of
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
to
document,
to
document
his
trespasses
on
other
lands,
and
that's...
the
citation
to
the
ibla
decision
is
at
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief
and
it
discusses
that
allegation
in
depth.
in
any
event--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--he
does
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
just
compensation
clause
or
bivens,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
can
challenge,
he
can
challenge
these
actions
under
the
administrative
process
available
to
him
under
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--apa--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--like
any
number
of
other
contexts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
has
to
challenge
each
administrative
action--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
he
claims
is
unlawful.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
did
not.
in
fact,
the
ibla
found
that
the
blm
had
a
right
of
administrative
access
to
cross
his
lands
to
get
to
public
lands
which
it
was
administering.
and
again,
this
case
would
have
been
quite
different
if
the
ibla
had
found
that
the
blm
officers
were
acting
without
legitimate
authority.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
they
do.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
has,
justice
breyer.
it
has.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
result
of
that
is
it
was
determined
that
these
actions
by
these
line
officers
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
were
perfectly
appropriate,
that
they
were
dealing
with
someone
who
has
systematically
violated
the
permits
and
conditions
that
are
found--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
believe
there
was
an
inspector
general
investigation,
investigation
within
the
department
of
interior
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
was
a
settlement
agreement,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
department
of
interior
stands
behind
the
actions
that
are
issued,
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
fair
characterization.
i
mean,
like
any
party
to
litigation,
any
party
to
multiple
lawsuits
and
claims,
there
are
many
reasons
why
it
might
be
deemed
in
the
interest
of
a
person
to
agree
to
a
settlement.
and
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--this
court
has
to
accept
those
factual
allegations,
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--to
be
sure.
but
the
court
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
a
fulsome
remedy,
justice
ginsburg,
when
you
think
of
the
claims
that
could
be
brought
administratively
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
to
receive
damages,
to
receive
injunctions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
allegation
is
that
these
trespasses
have
in
effect
deprived
me
of
my
property
which
is
my
business,
then
conceivably
he
could
make
a
request
for
a
large
amount
of
damages.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--he,
he
has
made
both
claims,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think...
he
has,
he
has
complained
about
blm
officials
exercising
the
right
of
administrative
access,
which
has
been
confirmed
at
the
administrative
level
and
which
is
well
settled.
and
he
has
made
the
more
general
complaint
that
these
trespasses
have...
and
interfered
with
his
businesses
and
interfered
with
his
property.
he
filed
a,
a
bond
in
this
court
seeking,
claiming
the
damages
were
in
several
million
dollars
related
to
the
business.
so
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--certainly
he
could
under
the
apa.
he
could
challenge
the
administrative
actions
he
complained
about,
and
if
court
concludes
those
are
unauthorized
or
unconstitutional
he
could
obtain
an
injunction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
other
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
many
of
these
discrete
administrative
actions...
for
example,
take
the
cancellation
of
the
permits.
that
was
based
on
a
course
of
conduct
that
included
20
formal
trespasses,
disregarding
trespass
notices
by
the
blm,
20
violations
of
his
grazing
permits.
all
of
that
would
be
part
of
a
record
before
the
ibla
and
before
a
federal
court
in
an
apa.
it
would
have
an
opportunity
to
review
those
allegations
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
alleged
federal
action
was
unlawful.
and
if
a
court
believed--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--he
would
have
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies,
just
like
any
number
of
other
people
who
believe
that
they
have
been
wronged
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
i...
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
the
ibla
found
that
there
was
not
an
effort
to
extort
or
blackmail
mr....
the
respondent
for
exercising
his
rights.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
ibla
found
and
we
cite
the
part
of
the
ibla
record
at
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief.
secondly
it's
well
established
that
the
government
can
seek
reciprocal
arrangements
with
respect
to
property.
the
court
in
the
leo
sheep
case
forced
the
government
to
seek
reciprocal
arrangements.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
scope
of
the
claim
before
the
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
blm
doesn't
have
to
stop
enforcing
its
laws
and
regulations
once
someone
refuses
to
enter
into
reciprocal
arrangements.
there
are
thousands
of
reciprocal
arrangements.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
a
valuable
right-of-way,
justice
scalia,
that...
that
was
for
30
years,
that
covered
14
miles
of
public
road--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
but
that
did
not
convey
with
the
property.
it
had
to
be
reassigned
in
order
for
mr.
robbins
to
take
advantage
of
that
right-of-way.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
and
it's
in
the
regulations.
the
right-of-way
has
to
be
reassigned,
and
it
wasn't
going
to
be
reassigned
because
respondent
refused
to
agree
to
the
reciprocal
easement
and
because
he
refused
to
make
rental
payments.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
right-of-way
was
for
30
years
which
was
long
than
the
20-year
easement
that
the
government
got
in
exchange.
and
this
something
that
was
negotiated
at
arm's
length
by
parties
that
didn't
have
the
acrimonious
relationship
that
developed
between
respondent
and
the
blm.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
i
don't
think
it
gives
him
a
cause
of
action
under
bivens
or
the
just
compensation
clause.
second--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--then
i,
then
i
don't
think
he
is
a
very
sympathetic
plaintiff
to
be
complaining
that
he
is
entitled
to
violate
blm
rules
or
regulations.
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
give
and
take
that
we
think
is
inherent
in
these
reciprocal
arrangements
and
we
think
that
the
just
compensation
clause
tolerates.
these
are,
the
just
compensation
clause
or
property
rights
here
are
protected
fundamentally
by
state
law.
that's
why
any
unauthorized
action
by
the
government
is
a
trespass,
which
is,
which
is
dealt
with
under
state
law.
the
just
compensation--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
he
was
on
notice.
the
blm
made
a
determination
that
because
it
wasn't
recorded,
it
wouldn't
seek
to
enforce
that
against
respondent.
it
may
be
that
it
was...
it
made
a
legal
error
on
that;
i
don't
know.
but
it
made
that
determination--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
in
any
event,
the
point
is
that
the
blm
recognized
that
it
had
to
negotiate
a
new
reciprocal
arrangement
with
respondent
and
it
sought
to
do
so.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it,
it's
trying
to
seek,
establish
a
new
reciprocal
arrangement.
regardless
of
why
it
was
back
in
the
position
of
having
to
do
so,
it
did
so
in
a
way
that
it
did
in
any
number
of
other
situations
that
did
arise.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
what
is
distinct
about
the
bivens
claim
here
is
first
bivens
and
just
compensation
clause
claims
are
fundamentally
incompatible.
and
that
in
bivens,
its
damages
are
nothing.
here
the
constitutional
right
actually
explicitly
provides
a
remedy,
just
compensation.
secondly,
just
compensation
claims
are
claims
against
the
government.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
two
points.
first,
davis
versus
passman
was
decided
in
a
day
in
which
this
court
was
much
more
likely
to
infer
new
causes
of
action
from
the
constitution
or
from
statutes.
the
court
in
its
recent
cases,
most
recently
malesko,
has
said
that
it's
sworn
off
that
habit,
and
it's
refused
to
recognize
any
new
bivens
action
in
25
years
since
those
cases
were
decided.
secondly,
the
respondent
here
has
ample
remedies
and
avenues
that
he
could
seek.
if
he
believes
that
there
has
been
unauthorized
trespass
he
can
seek
damages
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
would
be
closer
to
it
but
the
court
would
still
have
to
confront
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
infer
a
constitutional
tort
under
the
just
compensation
clause.
and
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
do
so.
there
is
an
overarching
question
here
of
qualified
immunity.
whatever
is
true
with
respect
to
whether
this
new
constitutional
tort
should
be
created
towards
other
claims
before
the
court,
the
petitioners
on
this
case
were
not
on
clear
notice
that
their
actions
in
responding
to
someone
who
had
systematically
violated
the
rules
and
regulations,
which...
on
the
books
for
some
time...
would
subject
them
to
personal
damages
actions
and
in
fact
treble
damages
under
the
rico
statute.
for
that,
for
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
if
that's
true--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
that's...
they
would
be
on
notice,
that
that
conduct
if
true
could
subject
them
to
a
tort
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
there
is
no
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
respondent
has
pointed
to
that
would
put
the
petitioners
here
on
notice
in
the
specific
situation
they
confronted,
that
their
actions
could
subject
them
to
a
constitutional
tort
which
had
never
been
recognized
by
any
court,
whether
their
actions
could
subject
them
to
treble
damages
under
rico.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
have
to
have--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
the
first
question
is
whether
he
has
established
a
violation
of
the
right.
and
the
rights
that
are
alleged
in
this
case
that
are
before
this
court,
or
a
right
under
the
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
the...
the...
the
congress
has
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
from
those
types
of
claims
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's
against
the
united
states
if
they
are
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
conduct.
if
it's
unauthorized
actions
outside
the
scope
of
the
conduct,
then
they
can
go
directly
against
the
individuals.
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
then
it
would
be
additional
suits
in
state
court.
they
could
also...
there
are
also
state,
federal
and
criminal
laws
that
they
could
seek
to
invoke
or
have
invoked.
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--two
things,
justice
souter.
first
the
argument
was
not
raised
below;
we
don't
think
it's
properly
before
the
court.
second,
the
question
under
qualified
immunity,
and
this
court
made
this
clear
in
the
wyatt
case
and
again
in
the
knight
case,
it
doesn't
look
to
the
particular
offense.
it
looks
to
the
nature
of
the
responsibility
that
the
government
officials
are
performing.
and
here
the
nature
of
the
responsibilities
are
enforcing
grazing
permits,
enforcing
access
to
public
lands,
activities
that
blm
officials
have
discretion
and
have
had
discretion
for
more
than
a
century
to
enforce.
and
we
think
that
falls
squarely
within
the
rubric
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
first,
the
large
portion
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
have
concluded
that
qualified
immunity
principles
do
extend
to
rico.
and
second,
again,
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
is
on
the
nature
of
the
responsibilities.
it's
not
on
the
particular
offense
alleged.
it's
not
on
whether
there's
a
violation
of
that
offense.
it's
the
nature
of
the
responsibilities,
and
here
these
responsibilities,
enforcing
permits
enforcing
access
and
use
of
public
land,
and
protecting
against
abuse
of
those
lands,
are
things
that
blm
officials
and
other
government
officers
have
exercised
their
discretion
to
do
for
more
than--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
no,
because
we
don't
think
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
just
compensation
clause
when
someone
doesn't
take
property,
when
someone
doesn't
act
through
allegedly--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--oh,
are
you...
the
question
with
respect
to
qualified
immunity?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
think
that
qualified
immunity
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
because
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
substantive
fifth
amendment
right
and
there
has
been
no
violation
of
bivens.
it's
important
to
recognize
the
overarching
context
of
how
the
federal
government
manages
the
public
lands.
there
are...
there
are
numerous
reciprocal
arrangements
that
could
be
affected
by
this.
any
time
a
landowner
refuses
to
enter
into
a
reciprocal
arrangement,
he
can
then
turn
around
in
any
government
action
that
is
taken
against
that
landowner,
all
he
has
to
do
is
add
on
an
element
of
wrongful
subjective
intent,
and
he
can
bring
a
constitutional
tort
claim,
or
even
a
rico
claim
like
the
respondent
here,
and
subject
officers
to
the
threat
of
personal
liability.
and
we
think
that
this
would
have
a
significant
skewing
effect
on
legitimate
government
decision
making.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i
want
to
clarify,
the
question
of
the--
assignment.
and
our
position,
it's
always
been
our
position
that
a
new
right-of-way
had
to
be
issued
after
the
property
was
sold.
and
i'll
point
the
court
to
ja
84,
which
is
where
the
blm
officials
made
clear
at
the
outset
that
an
assignment
was
required.
point
the
court
to
ja
100
which
is
the
right-of-way--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--pointing
to
ja
100
which
is
the
right-of-way,
which
says
that
in
accordance
with
federal
regulations,
and
i
point
the
court
to
43
cfr
2803,
which
discusses
assignments
and
makes
clear
that
assignments
have
to
be
approved.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
ginsburg,
assignments
have
to
be
approved
by
the
blm.
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
was
never
approved.
and
that's
clear,
there
was
never
any
valid
assignment.
that's
why
the
reciprocal
arrangement
had
to
be
negotiated
anew
and
again,
i
point
to
43--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it...
it
was
revoked
as
part
of
the
decision
not
to
assign
it.
and
that's
clear
from
the
decision
canceling
the
right-of-way.
there
was
no
assignment
that
could
be
approved,
and
rents
had
not
been
paid
on
it.
so
it
was
combined
with
the
assignment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
in
order
for
the
right-of-way,
because
these
are
rights-of-way
to
public
lands.
they
have
to
approved
by
new...
once
new
property
owners
seek
to
assert
them.
and
again
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but,
but
again
it's
clear...
and
it
was
not
approved,
and
one
of
the
reasons
it
wasn't
approved
was
because
rents
weren't
paid
and
he
wasn't
agreeing
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
regulations
which
are
part
of
the
right-of-way.
and
that's
at
ja--
100.
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
make,
justice
kennedy,
is
we
agreed
this
would
be
a
dramatic
new
extension
of
bivens,
and
we
agree
with
justice
breyer,
the
problems
or
types
of
litigations
that
this
new
constitutional
tort
would
create
are
really
just...
the...
capable
of
the
imagination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
it's
not.
because
the
respondent
here
has
more
statutory
and
administrative
remedies
available
to
him
than
the
plaintiff
in
passman
did,
including
claims
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
trespasses,
for
any
of
the
other
alleged
wrongs
that
you've
heard
about
here
today.
these
were...
these
were
wrongs
that
were
addressed
by
the
ibla
and
the
apa.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
don't
have
a
bivens
remedy
and
they
don't
have
a
rico
remedy.
i'd
point
the
court
to
lujan
versus
national
wildlife
federation,
where
the
court
said
that
in
that
situation
what
a
plaintiff
must
do
is
challenge
each
administrative
action
individually,
and
the
types
of
programmatic
pattern
challenges
are
for
congress,
they're
for
executive
branches;
they
are
for
inspector
generals.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
law
and
this
court
reasonably
assumes
that
where
individuals
have
remedies
available
to
them
through
challenging
individual--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
there
are
actions
against
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
or
actions
finding
government
conduct
unauthorized
under
the
apa,
that
the
government
will
take
action
to
prevent
that.
here
every
action
that
was
challenged
was
found
to
be
appropriate
and
lawful
under
the
existing
regime.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse.
