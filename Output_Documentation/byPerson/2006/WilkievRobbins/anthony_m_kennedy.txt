justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
a
quick
question.
i
had
the
same
list
of
alleged
acts,
and
i
think
many
of
them
are
uncontested,
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned.
just
as
a
matter
of
policy,
can
you
inform
me,
when
the
solicitor
general's
office
takes
this
case
do
you
look
into
whether
any
of
these
things
happen
and
the
justice
department
issues
a
warning,
don't
do
this
any
more?
if
these
things
are
as
justice
ginsburg
explained
you
don't
defend
all
of
those
actions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
this,
if
this
continues,
your
argument...
and
i
understand
your
argument
that
there's
no
essential
free-standing
cause
of
action
for
damages...
basically
means
he
has
a
right
to
go
broke
with
attorneys'
fees
challenging
each
individual
incursion,
each
individual
wrong.
well,
again
that
assumes
that
he
wouldn't
get
any
relief
out
of
the
ibla.
that
assumes
that
if
he
had
gone
to
the
ibla
and
said,
you
canceled
my
grazing
permits
for
grounds
that
weren't
valid,
that
the
blm
would
have
proceeded
to
engage
in
the
same
conduct.
in
fact,
the
ibla--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--piecemeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
piecemeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
he
have
any
action
that
is
other
than
piecemeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
answer
is
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
originally
negotiated,
with
i
think
nelson.
was
the
right-of-way
cancellable
at
any
time?
or
how
long
would
the
right-of-way
last?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i
ask
you
about
the
bivens
theory
here
before
your
time
runs
out?
doesn't
davis
versus
passman
help
the
respondent
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
that's
because
we
assume
it's
focused
just
on
his
property
and
that
the
property
was
ultimately
the
thing
that
was
in
issue.
but
if
you
have
all
these
other
retaliatory
actions,
and
wrongful
actions
taken
by
the
government
tangential
to
this
dispute,
i
take
it
davis
versus
passman,
broadly
read,
says
we
can
use
bivens
if
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
a
remedy
against
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
think...
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
latter
point.
we
think
he
is
really
in
a
bind;
there's
not
really
anything
he
can
do.
doesn't
that
invoke
the
davis
versus
passman
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
expand...
it
would
be
an
expansion
of
bivens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
people
who
had
done
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure,
professor
tribe,
that
the
cases
you
cite
at
page
22,
23
of
your
brief
really
support
your
position.
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
a
freestanding
cause
of
action
for
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
the
brief
you
say
that
the
government
says
that
this
is
limited
first
amendment,
and
then
you
say,
"these
remarkable
claims
are
unsurprisingly
false.
"
i
thought
that
was
a
rather
severe
charge
against
the
government,
that
it's
misrepresenting
its
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
in
page
22
and
23,
you
go
ahead
and
you
talk
about
wisconsin
versus
yoder,
lefkowitz
versus
turley,
bordenkircher,
which
i
think
was
vindictive
prosecution
or
adding
on
charges.
all
of
those
are
in
the...
every
one
of
these
cases
are
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
griffin,
a
murder
case.
it's
just
alleging
a
constitutional--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--alleging
a
constitutional
claim.
well,
which
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no.
that
was,
there
was
an
existing
case
or
controversy
there.
that
wasn't
a
freestanding
cause
of
action.
none
of
these
cases
are
freestanding.
davis
versus
passman,
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
those
cases
do
not
support
your
position,
and
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
that
this
is
unsurprising,
that
the
government
makes
a
false
representation
about
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
freestanding
right,
but
let's
leave
that
aside.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
right.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
are
asking
us
to
extend
bivens,
this
is
an
extension.
would
you
accept
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
statutory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
professor
tribe,
all
these
cases
are
cases
in
which
there
is...
nollan,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
to
challenge
the
permit
and
this
is
just
a,
this
is
just
a
constitutional
defense.
that's
different
from
a
freestanding
cause
of
action.
and
i
share
justice
scalia's
concern.
it
seems
to
me
in
thinking
about
this
case
there
is...
there
could
be
something
very
wrong
here,
going
after
a
person
because
of
what
he's
done.
suppose
the
government
wants
somebody
to
be
a
witness
in
a
trial
and
he
won't
do
it,
and
they
go
around
hurting
his
business,
they
go
around
invading
his
property
and
so
forth.
that
to
me
is
outrageous
and
you
might
have
an
argument
that
there
should
be
a
bivens
cause
of
action
for
that.
and
justice
scalia's
question...
i
had
the
same
question...
is
why
do
we
think
it
to
the
property?
the
essence
here,
the
essence
of
what's
going
on,
is
that
they're
being
vindictive
against
this
person.
now
again,
the
cases
you're
citing,
include
hartman,
which
is
a
free
speech
case
which
is
different,
really
don't
support
you.
i
think
this
is
an
extension
of
bivens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fair
enough,
but
it's
an
extension
of
bivens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
davis
versus
passman
is
a
different
context.
but
in
theory
is
it
consistent
with
what
the
respondent
asks?
