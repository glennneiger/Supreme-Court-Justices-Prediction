habeas
is
an
equitable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--habeas
is
equitable
relief
and
the
court
has
a
lot
of
discretion
in
identifying
the
boundaries
of
equitable
relief,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that's
how
we
got
to
teague.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
there
would
be
a
rule
60(b)
motion
or
the
equivalent
of
it
in
state
court.
if
indeed
our
law
had
changed;
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
inconceivable
that
the
problem
wouldn't
be
solved
in
some
fashion
by
the
state
court
that
rendered
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
not
just
"clearly";
"then
clearly
established
law".
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
but
you
know,
how
you
play
the
game
depends
upon
at
what
level
of
generality
you
describe
the
right.
and
i
agree
with
you
if
you
describe
the
right
as
the
right
to
cross-examination,
that...
that
was...
reinstituted
by
crawford,
which
said
that
the
confrontation
right
is
a
right
to
confrontation...
to
cross-examination,
which
didn't
exist
before.
i
mean,
you
could
dispense
with
that
right
of
cross-examination
if
there
were
indicia
of
reliability.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
so...
in
such
a
facile
fashion
decide
what
is
a
bedrock
principle.
frankly,
i
don't
know
any
formula
that
would...
that
would
describe
it.
i
really
think
it
is
a...
you
know
it
when
you
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
like
obscenity.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
case
in
federal
courts,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
conceivable
that
federal
courts
would
interpret
the
hearsay
rule
to
require
precisely
that
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
you
shouldn't
be
making
this
argument
because
it
applies
only
to
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
say
in
crawford,
i
don't
think
we
said
in
crawford...
i
ought
to
know,
i
suppose.
[laughter]
--that
the
new
rule
produced
greater
accuracy.
we
said
that
it
was
the
view
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
that
cross-examination,
confrontation
in
that
sense,
was
necessary
for
greater
accuracy.
now
in
our
evaluation
of
what
constitutes
a
landmark
decision,
are
we
bound
to
the
framers'
view
of
things?
i
mean,
you
know,
maybe...
i'm
not
sure
that
if
you
apply
a
proper
interpretation
of
indicia
of
reliability
under
roberts,
i'm
really
not
sure
whether
it
wouldn't
be
more
accurate
than
confrontation,
but
that
wouldn't
matter
to
me,
because
confrontation
is
what
the
constitution
required
and
what
the
framers
thought
were
necessary.
am
i
bound,
for
purposes
of
the
rule
we're
arguing
about
here,
to
what
the
framers
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
discussion
of
the,
you
know,
the
contrary
decisions
that
had
been
produced
under
roberts
was
just
for
the
purpose
of
justifying
the
overruling
of
a
case
that...
you
know...
that
was
not
that
old.
it
hadn't
worked
out
as
well
as
we
maybe
expected
it
would.
but
i
don't
think
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
it
always
produces
unreliable
results.
