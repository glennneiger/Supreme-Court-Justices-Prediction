mr.
george
j.
chanos
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
crawford
v.
washington
should
not
apply
retroactively
to
cases
on
collateral
review
because
it
fails
to
meet
the
exacting
standards
for
retroactivity
established
by
this
court
in
teague
versus
lane.
in
addition,
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
relief
under
aedpa.
teague
held
that
new
rules
of
criminal
generally
should
not
apply
to
cases
on
collateral
review
unless
they
fall
within
one
of
two
narrow
exceptions.
the
second
exception,
at
issue
here,
is
for
those
new
watershed
rules
of
criminal
procedure
without
which
the
likelihood
of
an
accurate
conviction
is
seriously
diminished,
rules
that
alter
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
essential
to
a
fair
proceeding.
crawford
is
not
a
watershed
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
the
only
example
that
this
court
has
pointed
to
in
its
25
years
of
retroactivity
jurisprudence
is
gideon
versus
wainwright.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
none
other
occurs
to
me
at
this
time.
none
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
are
not
retroactive
would
i
find
to
be
retroactive
or
watershed,
and
i
certainly
don't
find
crawford
to
be
watershed.
crawford
is
not
watershed
because
it
is
not
a
rule
without
which
the
likelihood
of
an
accurate
conviction
is
seriously
diminished
and
it
is
not
a
rule
which
altered
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
essential
to
a
fair
proceeding.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
no,
chief
justice
roberts.
i
believe
that
you
could
go
straight
to
2254(d)(1)
and
bar
relief
under
2254(d)(1).
mr.
george
j.
chanos
well,
2254(e)(2)
provides
a
cause
and
prejudice
opportunity
in
the
event
that
the
state
court
denies
relief
on
a
procedural
basis
rather
than
a
substantive
basis
and
the
petitioner
can
show
cause
and
prejudice
under
2254(e)(2)(a).
the
federal
court
could
then
look
at
the
petitioner's
claim
because
no
merits
determination
had
been
made
by
the
state
court
and,
finding
the
cause
and
prejudice
elements
under
2254(e)(2),
the
federal
court
would
not
be
precluded
from
making
a
merits
determination
since
the...
and
conceivably
applying
a
rule
that
had
been
made
retroactive
active
under
teague...
because
the
state
court
had
not
made
a
substantive
merits
determination.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
correct.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
our
reading
of
2254(d)(1)
is
that
congress
intended
to
have
the
federal
courts
give
the
state
courts
deference
to
the
extent
that
the
state
courts
made
a
substantive
determination.
if
the
state
courts
made
no
substantive
determination,
there's
no
requirement
for
deference
by
the
federal
courts,
which
under
2254(e)(2)(a)(i)
the
federal
court
conceivably
find
that
there
was
cause
and
prejudice
under
2254(2)(a)(i)
under
the
standards
enumerated
in
those
subparagraphs
(a)
and
(b)
and
could
then
make
a
merits
determination.
there
would
be
nothing
that
would
preclude
the
federal
court
from
making
a
merits
determination
so
long
as
the
state
court
had
not
already
made
a
merits
determination.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
it
would
mean
under...
under
a
plain
meaning
reading
of
2254(d)(1),
if
the
state
court
made
a
determination
on
the
merits,
it
would
bar
subsequent
federal
review
whether
it
was
a
substantive,
a
substantive
claim
or
a
procedural
claim.
however,
in
atkins
v.
kentucky
there
would
be
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
petitioner
from
going
back
to
the
state
court
and
arguing
cause
and
prejudice,
and
then
if
the
state
court
were
to
make
a
procedural
determination
on
the
second
petition
that
was...
that
were
to
deny
the
petitioner
his
claim,
he
could
take
that
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
could
then
look
at
that
because
it
was
only
a
procedural
determination
by
the
state
court
on
the
second
habeas
claim
and
the
federal
court
at
that
point
could
look
back
at
the
substantive
rule
as
established
law
because
on
the
second
claim
they
have
the
right,
if
he's
only
denied
a
procedure...
on
a
procedural
basis,
there's
nothing
that
would
preclude
the
federal
court
on
his
second
claim
from
looking
back
at
what
would
then
be
established
law.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
my
understanding
is
that
the
rule
in
teague
is...
the
source
is
not
the
u.s.
constitution.
it's
a
judicially
created
rule
that
began
with
linkletter
and
developed
into
teague
and
its
progeny.
and
yes,
i
believe
congress
could
pass
2254(d)(1)
and
alter
the
habeas
procedures,
as
they
have
in
enacting
2254(d)(1).
mr.
george
j.
chanos
i'm
sorry?
mr.
george
j.
chanos
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
while
under
the
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence
griffith
would
control,
under
2254
it
would
not.
2254(d)(1)
would
control.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
it
make
difference.
it
makes
a
difference.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
would
be
able
to
make
a
subsequent
habeas
petition
at
the
state
court
level
and
if
they
were
somehow
denied
relief
on
a
procedural
basis,
there
would
be
nothing
that
would
preclude
the
federal
court
from
granting
them
relief
thereafter.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
justice
ginsburg,
what
we're
saying
is
that
congress
in
enacting
2254(d)(1)
was
stating
that
the
federal
courts
should
give
deference
to
the
state
court
decision
so
long
as
it
is
a
merits
decision
and
so
long
as
it
complies
with
existing
clearly
established
law
and
is
not
unreasonable.
and
if
that
occurs,
then
congress
under
2254(d)(1)
was
saying
give
state
courts
deference
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
that's
exactly.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
exactly,
absolutely,
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
decision.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
2254(d)(1)
it
says
"resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
"
it
doesn't
say
"is
contrary
to
clearly
established
law.
"
it
says
"was
contrary
to".
mr.
george
j.
chanos
well,
in
either
case,
it
is
referring
to
the--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
our,
our
position
would
be
that
it
would
be
up
to
when
the
decision
became
final.
whatever
the
law
was
up
to
the
time
that
the
decision,
the
state
court
decision
became
final,
that
is
what
was
clearly
established
law.
i'll
continue
with
our
teague
analysis
because
we
believe
that
the
claim
is
barred
under
either
analysis.
the--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--yes.
yes.
and
what
crawford...
what
we
believe
crawford
was
saying...
well,
crawford
said
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation
is
bedrock.
it
didn't
say
that
that
decision
altered
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
that
is
the
standard.
not
whether
or
not
the
sixth
amendment
is
bedrock.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
case
of
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
betts
versus
brady,
in
betts
versus
brady
this
court
had
held
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
was
not
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
14th
amendment.
gideon
overruled
betts
versus
brady
and
said
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
was
applicable
to
the
states
under
the
14th
amendment.
that
alters
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
that
are
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
in
one
case,
we're
saying
right
to
counsel
is
not
one
of
those
bedrock
procedural
elements.
is
not,
therefore,
applicable
to
the
states
under
the
14th
amendment,
betts
versus
brady.
in
the
next
case
we're
saying
right
to
counsel
is
it
implicit
in
the
constitution.
it
is
an
essential
to
the
fairness
of
a
proceeding,
and
it
is
therefore
applicable
to
the
states
under
the
14th
amendment.
that
truly
alters
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
that
are
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
in
contrast,
when
you
look
at
crawford
vis-a-vis
ohio
versus
roberts,
the...
there's
a
real
distinction
there.
in
both
cases,
we
know
that
the
right
to
confrontation
is
essential
and
fundamental
and
one
of
those
bedrock
elements
that
are
essential
to
a
fair
proceeding.
therefore
crawford
doesn't
alter
our
understanding
of
what
elements
are
or
are
not
essential
to...
bedrock
elements
essential
to
a
fair
proceeding.
instead
it
modifies
the
contours--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--would
i
make
the
same
analysis?
mr.
george
j.
chanos
yes.
crawford
doesn't
tell
us
that
the
rights
to
confrontation
or
the
right
of
cross-examination
is
a
new
right
as
gideon
tells
us.
instead
crawford
tells
us--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--it
alters,
it
modifies
the
manner
in
which
we
implement
that
right.
under
ohio
versus
roberts
there
was
plenty
of
cross-examination
that
was
occurring.
the
standard
under
ohio
versus
roberts
was
unavailability
and
inadequate
indicia
of
reliability.
there
was
a
reliability
screen
in
place,
and
it
was
clear
under
ohio
versus
roberts
that
the
right
to
confrontation
was
an
essential
bedrock
right,
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
well,
there
were--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--i
understand.
the
other
point
that--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--the
other
point
is
that
there's
a
second
component
to
watershed
which
is
it
must
be
a
rule
without
which
the
accuracy
of
a
proceeding
is
seriously
diminished.
there
was
cross-examination
under
ohio
versus
roberts.
there...
in
crawford,
the
language
of
crawford
isn't
a
sweeping
indictment
of...
of
roberts.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
i'm
sorry?
mr.
george
j.
chanos
there
was
cross-examination
of
the
mother,
there
was
cross-examination
of
the
police
detective...
there
was
cross-examination
of--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--not
of
autumn...
not
of
autumn
bockting.
but
the
important
point
that
i
want
to
make
before
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
is
that
the
question
isn't
simply,
is
crawford
accuracy-enhancing?
the
question
is
is
it
a
rule
without
which
the
accuracy
of
a
proceeding
is
seriously
diminished.
in
other
words
must
all--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
george
j.
chanos
that,
and
it
is
really
an
analysis
of
roberts.
is,
is
that
judicial
determination
of
reliability
under
adequate
indicia
of
reliability,
so
fundamentally
flawed
that
all
of
the
decisions
that
were,
that
were
arrived
at
pursuant
to
its
authority
must
be
undone,
and
new
trials
must
occur
with
respect
to
those
decisions
because
it
is
so
fundamentally
flawed.
and
our
point
is
that
it
is
not.
it
does
not
rise
to
that
level
of
inadequacy
and
crawford
is
therefore
not
a
rule
without
which
the
accuracy
of
a
proceeding
is
seriously
diminished.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
george
j.
chanos
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
only
have
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
counsel's
argument
with
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
2254(d)(1)
clearly
established
language
is
inconsistent
with
the
statement
made...
statements
made
by
this
court
in
lockyer
and
in
williams
v.
taylor.
in
lockyer,
the
court
stated
section
2254(d)(1)'s
clearly
established
phase
referred
to
the
holdings,
as
opposed
to
the
dicta,
of
this
court's
decisions
as
of
the
time
of
the
relevant
state
court
decision,
citing
williams
v.
taylor.
in
other
words,
clearly
established
federal
law
under
2254(d)(1)
is
the
governing
legal
principle
or
principles
set
forth
by
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
the
state
court
renders
its
decision.
with
regard
to
counsel's
point
about
this
case
in
particular,
bockting,
i
agree
that
there
are
broader
issues
beyond
this
particular
fact
situation.
however,
i
want
the
court
to
feel
comfortable
that
when
this
court
sent
this
case
back
down
to
the
nevada
supreme
court
and
told
the
nevada
supreme
court
to
follow
ohio...
idaho
versus
wright,
the
factors
in
idaho
versus
wright
to
determine
trustworthiness,
talk
about
spontaneity
and
consistent
reputation...
repetition,
mental
state
of
declarant,
use
of
terminology
unexpected
of
a
child
of
similar
age,
and
lack
of
motive
to
fabricate.
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
must
be
so
trustworthy
that
adversarial
testing
would
add
little
to
its
reliability.
following
that
admonishment
from
this
court,
the
nevada
supreme
court
found
those
statements
to
be
reliable
and
to
satisfy
the
standards
of
ohio...
idaho
versus
wright.
finally,
i
would
just
point
out
that
although
caldwell
is
indeed
an
important
rule,
and
may,
in
fact,
be
a
fundamental
rule,
so
was
batson
in
teague,
as
was
caldwell
in
sawyer,
as
was
ring
in
summerlin,
as
was
duncan
in
distefano
as
was
mills
in
banks.
yet
this
court
failed
to
apply
retroactive
status
to
any
of
those
important
fundamental
rules
saying
none
of
them
rose
to
the
level
of
gideon
versus
wainwright.
the
same
should
be
true
with
your
decision
here
with
respect
to
crawford.
finally,
as
justice
harlan
stated
in
the
case
of
mckay,
talking
about
where
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence
has
come
from,
no
one,
not--
mr.
george
j.
chanos
--thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
chanos
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
no
one,
not
criminal
defendants,
not
the
judicial
system,
not
society
as
a
whole
is
benefitted
by
a
judgment
providing
that
a
man
shall
tentatively
go
to
jail
today,
but
tomorrow
and
every
day
thereafter
his
continued
incarceration
shall
be
subject
to
fresh
litigation
on
issues
already
resolved.
thank
you.
