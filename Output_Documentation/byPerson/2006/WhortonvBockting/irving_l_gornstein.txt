mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
crawford
does
not
satisfy
either
of
the
two
requirements
for
a
retroactive
watershed
rule.
the
application
of
roberts
rather
than
crawford
did
not
so
seriously
diminish
the
likelihood
of
accurate
convictions
as
to
require
the
wholesale
reopening
of
convictions
that
were
final
before
crawford
was
decided,
with
all
the
societial
costs
that
entails.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
have
an
interest
in
the
aedpa
question
because
it
does
not
apply
to
federal
convictions,
the
2254(d)(1),
and
there
is
no
federal
conviction
analog
to
2254(d)(1),
so
we
are
not
telling
you
that
you
should
or
should
not
reach
it.
we
just
don't
have
an
interest
in
that
question.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
we
have
a
general
interest
in
the
way
law
is
applied
in
federal
court
but
we
do
not
ordinarily
opine
on
issues
just
on
that
basis
and
we
haven't
in
the
past
opined
on
aedpa
issues
unless
they
have
some
federal
analog
carryover
effect.
and
we
did
not
here.
now
with
respect
to
the
reliability
prong
of
the
teague
analysis,
there
are
three
reasons
that
the
roberts
rule
did
not
so
seriously
diminish
the
likelihood
of
accurate
convictions
as
to
call
for
retroactive
application
of
crawford.
the
first
is
that
roberts
had
a
built-in
reliability
screen.
hearsay
could
not
be
admitted
under
roberts
unless
a
determination
was
made
that
there
were
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
the
second
reason
that
roberts
did
not
seriously
diminish
the
likelihood
of
accurate
convictions
is
that
there
were
other
procedural
components
that
operated
in
tandem
with
roberts
to
promote
accuracy.
they
included
the
right
to
cross-examine
the
witness
through
whom
an
hearsay
statement
was
introduced,
the
right
to
introduce
your
own
evidence
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
hearsay
statement.
defense
counsel
could
point
out
to
the
jury
all
the
weaknesses
in
the
hearsay
statement
and
the
defendant
could
count
on
the
common
sense
of
the
jury
to
weigh
the
reliability
of
the
hearsay
statement
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
self-sufficient
argument
for
that
reason.
it
is
just
one
component
of
the
argument
about
why
there
was
reliability.
the
fact
that
there
was
a
roberts
screen
on
reliability
is
an
additional
factor
that
distinguishes
my
example
from
what
you
said.
and
the
fact
is
that
there
was
a
right
to
cross-examine
live
witnesses
here.
so
there
was
a
right
to
cross-examine
the
police
officer
through
whom
this
hearsay
statement
was
made.
it
is
not
a
case
where
there
was
an
across-the-board
denial
of
any
cross-examination.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
think
crawford
that
is
an
important
decision.
but
if
you
made
retroactive
every
one
of
your
important
decisions,
you
would
be
reversing
the
rule
of
teague.
what
teague
says
that
is
there
is
not...
that
the
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
are
largely
exhausted
once
somebody
has
received
a
trial
in
accordance
with
then
existing
law.
because
of
the
importance
of
finality
to
the
system...
and
there
are
only
going
to
be
two
very...
there's
only
a
very
narrow
window
for
watershed
rules,
of
rules
that,
the
accuracy
of
proceedings
beforehand
are
so
seriously
diminished
that
there
is
an
unacceptably
large
risk
that
systematically,
innocent
people
were
being
convicted,
and
that
this
is
a
rule
that
approaches
gideon
in
its
fundamental
and
sweeping
importance.
those
are
the
only
circumstances
in
which
the
court
is
going
to
go
back
on
finality.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
think
that
there
have
been...
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
but
maybe
11
or
12,
about
half
of
which
are
ones,
are
proposed
new
rules
and
half
of
which
are
ones
where
the
rule
was
already
established
previously
and
the
question
was
whether
it
was
going
to
be
made
retroactive.
and
i
cited
in
the
brief
there
are
three
or
four
death
penalty
cases
where
the
court
had
already
established
before
each
one
of
them
there
was
a
right
not
to
be...
the
death
penalty
to
be
arbitrarily
imposed.
and
in
each
case
there
was
a
new
rule
that
built
on
that
basic
rule
in
an
important
way;
but
in
each
case,
the
court
said
it
was
not
the
kind
of
rule
that
was
going
to
be
applied
retroactively.
and
so,
too,
here.
the
third
reason
i
wanted
to
give
about
why
there
was
not
a
serious
diminishment
in
accuracy
that
is
in
at
least
one
respect,
the
roberts
rule
actually
promotes
more
accuracy
than
the
crawford
rule,
and
that's
with
respect
to
non-testimonial
hearsay.
in
the
case
of
non-testimonial
hearsay,
under
roberts,
that
could
come
in
only
if
determination
had
been
made
there
were
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
whereas
under
the
crawford
rule,
that
kind
of
non-testimonial
hearsay
comes
in
without
any
reliability
check
under
the
constitution
at
all.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well
there
was
actually
in
this
case
the
mother's
testimony
about
what
the
daughter
said
to
her.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
the
daughter's
testimony
about
what
she
said
to
the
mother
illustrates
the
difference,
because
that
came
in
through
the
mother.
it
only
came
in
because
there
was
a
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
to
that
statement;
whereas
under
crawford
in
future
trials,
statements
to
the
mother...
which
are
not
testimonial...
they
will
come
in
through
the
mother
without
any
screen
for
reliability
under
the
constitution
at
all.
so
in
that
respect,
the
defendant
here
got
more
by
virtue
of
the
roberts
rule
than
by...
than
he
would
have
had
by
virtue
of
the
crawford
rule.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
interpreting...
what
protection
is
left
is
only
going
to
be
by
virtue
of
the
residual
hearsay
rule.
so
there
will
have
to
be
some
determination
made
about
whether
there
are
sufficient
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
justice
scalia--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i
think
it
applies
equally
to
federal
courts
because
it
is
free
to
the
federal
court
system
to
devise
a
rule
that
would
allow
a
looser
standard
of
entry
than
the
roberts
standards,
and
if
it
did,
that
would
be
constitutional.
so
there
is
an
interest
in
that
kind
of
argument
in
the
federal
system.
i
wanted
to
move
on
to
the
bedrock
aspect
of
the
inquiry,
which
is
a
separate
second
inquiry
that
had
threshold
that
has
to
be
crossed
if
you
are
going
to
find
something
to
be
watershed,
and
the
only
rule
that
the
court
has
found
to
be
bedrock
is
gideon.
and
this
rule,
carawford
does
not
approach
gideon
in
its
fundamental
and
sweeping
importance,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
for
that.
first,
the
right
to
counsel
pervasively
affected
all
aspects
of
the
criminal
trial
whereas
this
focuses
on
one
limited...
the
admissibility
of
one
limited
category
of
evidence,
testimonial
hearsay,
and
adopts
a
somewhat
new
rule
for
that
than
had
existed
before.
the
second
thing
is
that
under,
the
right
to
counsel
is
deemed
so
essential
to
a
fair
trial
that
depriving
someone
of
that
right
can
never
be
discounted
as
harmless
error,
whereas
crawford
errors
can
be
harmless.
there
are
a
significant
number
of
cases
where
they
are
found
to
be
harmless.
so
you
cannot
say
that
a
violation
of
the
crawford
rule
always
and
necessarily
results
in
an
unfair
trial,
whereas
you
can
say
that
about
the
right
to
counsel.
finally,
the
gideon
rule
established
for
the
first
time
a
right
to
free
counsel
in
all
felony
criminal
trials.
before
crawford
was
established,
there
was
a
right
to
cross-examine.
it
simply
was
a
different
right.
you
had
a
right
to
cross-examine
the
live
witnesses
and
you
had
a
right
to
screen
out
uncross-examined
statements
unless
they
met
the
reliability
standard
of
roberts.
and
the
change
that
was
made
was
one
in
which
the
roberts
rule
was
thrown
out,
and
you
can
no
longer
get
in
uncross-examined
statements
with
a
determination
of
reliability.
but
that
is
a
modification
or
an
incremental
change
in
an
existing
right
that
previously
existed
to
cross-examine,
and
instead...
unlike
the
gideon
rule,
which
established
the
right
to
counsel
for
the
first
time.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further.
