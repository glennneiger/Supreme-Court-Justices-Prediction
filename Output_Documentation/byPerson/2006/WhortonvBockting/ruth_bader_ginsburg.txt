could
you
give
an
example,
general
chanos,
of
one
that
is
other
than
gideon?
is
there
any
other
one,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
none
other
occurs
to
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
the
state
has,
which
is
going
straight
to
aedpa.
does
that
mean
that
teague
is
out
entirely,
even
the
first
category,
that
is
a
decision,
a
substantive
decision
that
would
mean
that
what
defendant
did
was
not
a
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
odd
position
to
take,
to
proliferate
proceedings
that
way.
i
mean,
i
thought
your
argument,
aedpa
argument,
was:
too
bad,
the
federal
court
is
out
of
it,
but
the
state
court
is
most
likely,
recognizing
that
this
court
has
said
what
this
man
did
wasn't
a
crime,
to
grant
him
relief.
but
if
you're
making
this
two-step
and
saying,
but
somehow
we
can
change
the
substantive
proceeding
into
a
procedural
proceeding,
that
seems
to
me
odd,
to
proliferate
proceedings
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader

how
many
times
have
we
dealt
with
a
quote,
"new
rule",
with
the
argument
made
that
it
was
watershed
and
therefore
should
be
retroactive?
this
is
not
the
first
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
forsman,
what
about
the
cases
we're
had
so
far
on
this
second
teague
category?
as
far
as
i
know...
well,
we
haven't
found
anything
to
be
retroactive
on
collateral
review
so
far,
so
this
would
be
the
first
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
decision
that
said
ring
v.
arizona
was
not
retroactive
on
collateral?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
for
children
under
ten,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
you
just
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
we
had
someone
who
was
six
years
old
and
was
hardly
articulate,
it
seems
from
the
little
we
have
of
this
record.
so
the
nevada
statute
i
think
was
very
specific
to
children
and
was
not--
