chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
whorton
versus
bockting.
general
chanos.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
from
your
presentation
you
think
we
do
have
to
go
through
the
teague
analysis.
we
can't
just
rely
on
2254(d)(1)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
what
do
you
do
about
2254(e)(1),
or
i
guess
(e)(2),
which
seems
to
suggest
at
different
rule
if
a
case
is
made
retroactive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
my
point
was
that
looking
at
(d)(1),
it
says
is
the
decision
contrary
to
established
law.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
if
it's
a
new
decision
it's
clearly
not
contrary
to
established
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
look
at
(e)(2)
and
it
says
here's
what
you
do
if
you're
applying
a
new
decision
that's
that
been
made
retroactive.
so
i
would
have
thought
that
meant
you
can't
say
simply
because
it's
a
new
decision
it
won't
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
general
chanos.
mr.
gornstein,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
since
you
barely
cite
aedpa,
i
think
you
assume
we
need
to
reach
the
teague
question
before
the
aedpa
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
law
that
is
applied
in
federal
court,
though.
i
assume
you
have
an
interest
in
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
ms.
forsman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
ohio
versus
roberts
was
not
overruled
because
of
a
judgment
that
it
was
not
doing
a
good
enough
job
in
assessing
reliability
of
these
statements.
it
was
overruled
because
of
a
judgment
that
the
founders
wanted
there
to
be
cross-examination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
had
the
opportunity
to
challenge
those
findings
under
the
roberts
regime
in
state
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not...
the
state
has
to
result...
the
state...
it's
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court
and
results
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
federal
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
what
was
the
law,
what
was
the
clearly
established
law
at
the
time
of
the
state
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
forsman.
general
chanos,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
particularly
if
it
is
justice
harlan
you're
quoting.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
no.
05-595,
whorton
versus
bockting.
