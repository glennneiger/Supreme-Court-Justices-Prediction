what
is
the
source
of
the
rule
in
teague?
could
congress
overturn
the
rule
in
teague
if
it
wanted
to
and
say
that
nothing
is
retroactive
or
that
everything
is
retroactive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
crawford
did
use
the
term
bedrock?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
a
new
emphasis
on
cross-examination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
wasn't
cross-examination
by
defense
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case
there
wasn't
cross-examination
by
defense
counsel.
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
oh.
no,
i
mean
of
the
witness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
i
guess
you're
asking
us
to
say
crawford,
get
one,
take
one,
it
is
really
not
that
important.
if
that's
so,
i
suppose
we
shouldn't
have
overruled
roberts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
daughter's
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
in
an
instruction,
like
toomey
versus
ohio.
the
judge
is
corrupt.
it
is
just
structural.
you
can't
say
that
about
crawford,
or
can
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
problem
with
your
case...
maybe
it's
our
problem
because
it
was
our
rule...
is
that
we're
asked
to
adopt
an
across-the-board
calculus
as
to
the
rule.
in
some
cases,
as
i
think
you
will
have
to
concede,
under
the
roberts
jurisprudence,
the
fact
finding
was
more
accurate.
in
your
case,
what
you
are
telling
us
is
that
the
fact
finding
is
far
less
accurate.
but
i
think
you
are
stuck
unless
you
can
give
us
some
reason
that
we
depart
with
it.
with
a
rule-made
jurisprudence,
we
have
to
look
at
the
rule
in
the
whole
universe
of
cases,
not
just
your
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
problem
you
had
in
arguing
in
this
area,
and
maybe
you
can
suggest
some
way
out.
i
don't
see
it.
justice
anthony

adequate
indicia
of
reliability.
