justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can't
you
make
that
argument
about
any,
about
cross-examination
in
general?
it
is
debatable
whether...
how
good
cross-examination
is
in
determining
the
truthfulness
of
a
witness's
testimony.
now,
our
constitution
decides
the
issue
one
way,
but
any
infringement
of
cross-examination
could
be
susceptible
to
the
same
argument
that
you
are
making.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
language
in
2254(d)
that
could
incorporate
the
teague
exceptions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
we
say
if
we
were
to
say
that
2254(d)(1)
accommodates
the
teague
exceptions,
that
congress
meant
to
put
them
in
but
just
forgot
to
do
it?
how
would
we
account
for
the
language?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
making
the
tail
wag
the
dog,
because
there's
language
in
the
provisions
on
successive
petitions
that
refers
to
teague,
that
you
would
read
the
teague
exceptions
into
2254(d)(1)
when
there's
nothing
in
the
language
there
that
can
be
interpreted
to
refer
to
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
new
rules
of
criminal
procedure
announced
by
this
court
do
not
apply
to
cases
that
are
already
final
on
direct
review
unless
they
fit
within
a
narrow
exception
set
forth
in
teague
versus
lane
namely
where
the
new
rule
constitutes
a
watershed
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
implicates
the
fundamental
fairness
and
accuracy
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
whether
crawford
versus
washington
which
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
forbids
the
admission
of
uncrossed
examined
testimonial
hearsay
announced
the
new
rule
and
whether
it
is
a
watershed
rule.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
the
nevada
court
for
sexual
assault
on
a
minor.
out
of
court
statements
made
by
the
victim
were
admitted
at
trial
against
him.
the
nevada
supreme
court
held
that
this
did
not
violate
respondent’s
confrontation
right
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion
the
states
supreme
court
apply
the
standards
set
out
in
what
was
then
the
governing
confrontation
clause
precedent
ohio
versus
roberts.
after
respondent’s
conviction
became
final
on
direct
review
roberts
was
overruled
in
crawford.
a
federal
district
court
denied
respondent’s
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
crawford
applies
retroactively
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
this
decision
conflicted
with
those
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
that
had
addressed
this
issue
and
we
therefore
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
today
that
the
rule
announcing
crawford
is
a
new
rule
because
it
was
not
dictated
by
precedent
in
existence
at
the
time
when
respondent’s
conviction
became
final.
on
the
contrary
crawford
overruled
what
was
then
the
governing
precedent.
we
further
hold
that
the
crawford
rule
is
not
a
watershed
rule
implicating
“the
fundamental
fairness
and
accuracy
of
the
criminal
proceedings.”
first,
the
prior
governing
precedent
did
not
present
an
impermissibly
large
risk
of
an
inaccurate
conviction.
crawford
overall
affect
on
the
accuracy
of
fact
finding
in
criminal
trials
is
difficult
to
access
and
in
any
event
any
resulting
improvement
inaccuracy
is
insufficient
to
qualify
under
the
teague
exception.
second,
crawford
did
not
alter
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
necessary
to
the
fairness
of
a
proceeding.
our
cases
to
date
have
identified
one
rule
that
met
this
test
the
rule
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
the
crawford
rule
while
important
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
gideon.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
