that
gets,
if
you
follow
justice
scalia's
argument,
that
gets
you
to,
i
think
to
the
argument
you
have
made.
and
that
is
all
right,
we
have
got
to
look
at
it
pragmatically.
i
mean,
what
are
the
consequences
of
following
a
reliability
model
rather
than
a
cross-examination
model?
and
your
argument
is
consequences
that
are
not
necessarily
more
favorable
to
defendants,
in
fact...
or
more
productive
of
ultimately
reliable
determinations,
in
fact.
and
that
i
take
it
is
your
basic
point.
so
i
think
you've
answered
what
for
all
of
us
is
a
problem.
and
that
is
we
don't
have
a
clear
analytical
definition
of
bedrock;
but
if
we
look
to
consequences,
you
have
got
an
argument.
your
friends
don't
think
it
is
a
good
one,
but
that's
your
point.

justice

it's
a
question
about
how
much
more
accuracy-enhancing,
if
at
all?
