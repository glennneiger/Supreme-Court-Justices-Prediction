justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question
as
to
the
basic
issue
of
whether
you
should
be
relying
on
teague
or
the
statute.
if
you're
relying
just
on
the
statute,
how
would
it
apply
to
a
case
which
was
correct
under
established
law
at
the
time
that
the
state
court
made
its
ruling,
but
before
the
case
reached
the
appellate
court,
in
which
there
was
a
change
in
our
interpretation?
what
if
this
case...
if
crawford
had
been
decided
while
the
case
was
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
really
makes
a
difference
whether
we
rely
on
teague
or
whether
we
rely
on
the
statute
if
we
disagree
with
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
word
was
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
it
could
either
mean
at
the
time
of
the
trial
court's
decision
or
at
the
time
of
the
final
judgment
on
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
win
under
either
view,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
could
mean
either
of
those
two
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
make
the
same
analysis
if
you
say
the
right
is
not
necessarily
the
right
of
confrontation
but
the
narrower
right
of
cross-examination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
is
central
to
crawford.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment,
ms.
forsman,
on
your
opponent's
argument
based
on
2254(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
forsman,
can
i
ask
you
a
personal
question?
were
you
a
moot
court
finalist?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
attend
a
moot
court
at
notre
dame
in
about
your
year
and
it
was
an
awfully
good
moot
court.
