ms.
franny
a.
forsman
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
members
of
the
court:
this
man
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
based
upon
accusations
that
have
never
been
tested
by
the
only
constitutionally
reliable
test
that
is
now
acceptable
in
this
court.
there
is
no
question
that
the
statements
that
were
admitted
through
the
police
officer
were
testimonial.
there
is
no
question
that
if
mr.
bockting
were
tried
today,
that
those
statements
would
not
have
come
in.
the
government
has
argued
that
the
reliability
screen,
so-called,
that
came
from
roberts
was
sufficient,
and
it
was
only
an
incremental
change
when
the
crawford
decision
was
decided.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
court
found
that
the
reliability
screen
that
the
government
has
discussed
was
fundamentally
flawed.
and
in
this
case,
comparing
the
right
to
counsel
to
the
right
to
cross-examination
is
easy.
it
is
easy
because
it
would
not
have
mattered
how
many
lawyers
mr.
bockting
had.
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
he
had
the
finest
lawyers
in
the
country.
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
he
was
duke
power
company
and
had
every
lawyer
at
the
highest
hourly
rate
representing
him.
if
he
was
unable
to
cross-examine
his
accuser,
just
as
in
crawford...
in
crawford,
there
was
even
an
audiotape
of
what
the
wife
said.
there
was
an
audiotape.
there
was
a
police
officer
who
listened
to
what
she
said.
and
this
court
found
that
wasn't
good
enough.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
no,
your
honor,
you
are
not
bound
to
what
the
framers
think.
however,
i
think
that
you
went
far
beyond
simply
saying
that
this
was
like
quartering
soldiers
in
discussing
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
right
to
confrontation.
the
opinion
goes
into
at
length
why
the
roberts
rule
was
so
fundamentally
flawed.
you
talked
about
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
were
produced,
although
this
court
said
that
this
court
had
pretty
much
tacked
to
the
same
direction
as
the
framers'
view.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
and
i
don't
think
that
our
burden
would
to
be
show
that
it
always
produces
unreliable
results.
i
think
that
this
court
has
clearly
taken
the
position
that
the
only
constitutional
reliability
is
the
right
to
cross-examination.
however,
throughout
your
retroactivity
jurisprudence,
you
have
been
able
to
distinguish
easily
between
issues
such
as
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
right
to
a
cross-section
of
the
community
on
a
jury,
and
the
right
to
cross-examination.
i
would
point
out
to
you,
the
decisions
that
made
bruton,
for
instance,
retroactive,
because
the
right
to
cross-examination
went
so
directly
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
i
think
that
one
of
the
major
difficulties
in
the
argument
being
taken
by
the
state--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--i
don't
mean
to
say,
your
honor,
that
it
is
structural.
i
think
the
issue
of
whether
something
is
structural
error
or
harmless
error
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it
is
measurable,
not
whether
it's
bedrock,
not
whether
it's
watershed,
not
whether
it
leads
to
better
accuracy.
we
know
that,
because
in
teague,
although
gideon
was
the
only
case
explicitly
referenced,
there
was
also
three
other
examples
mentioned
in
teague.
there
was
a
trial
tainted
by
mob
violence.
there
was
a
trial
flawed
because
of
the
intentional
introduction
of
perjured
testimony.
and
there
was
a
trial
flawed
by
the
introduction
of
testimony
with
regard
to
a
coerced
confession.
we
know
that
two
out
of
those
three
examples
are
actually
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
so
this
court
has
never
tied
the
issue
of
the
elements
of
teague
or
even
the
elements
of
the
pre-teague
jurisprudence
to
the
issue
of
whether
something
is
structural
or
harmless.
it
is
the
issue,
as
it
was
in
the
more
recent
decision
of
gonzalez-lopez,
of
the
right
to
choice
of
counsel
decision.
they
are
what
the
court
looked
to
to
determine
the
issue
was,
is
it
harmless,
is
it
quantifiable.
and
in
this
case,
courts
are
accustomed,
appellate
courts
are
accustomed
to
looking
at
the
introduction
of
this
kind
of
evidence
and
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
harmless.
the
state
has
not
taken
a
position
before
this
court
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
erroneous
in
determining
that
this
evidence
was
prejudicial,
and
therefore
affected
the
outcome.
so
the
issue
of
accuracy
as
defined
by
the
state
and
by
the
government,
the
problem
with
that
argument
and
the
easiest
way
to
see
the
problem
in
that
argument
is
if
you
look
to
gideon.
certainly
we
wouldn't
argue
that
the
insertion
of
counsel
into
a
case
may
not
result
in
what
the
state
is
defining
as
a
more
accurate
result.
the
insertion
of
counsel
into
a
case
may
well
cause
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
in
fact,
in
many
instances
that
is
exactly
what
counsel
does.
so
their
definition
of
accuracy
if
applied
to
the
gideon
case
would
mean
that
gideon
would
flunk
that
definition,
and
wouldn't
be
the
case
that
has
been
so
repeatedly
referenced
by
this
court
as
an
example
of
the
kind
of
case
that
should
be
made
retroactive.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
it
would
be,
your
honor,
and
it
is
appropriate
that
this
be
the
first
time.
as
i
previously
referenced,
those
cases
fell...
there
are
12
of
them,
by
the
way.
there
were
12
decisions
post
teague
applying
the
teague
analysis
in
which
this
court
did
not
find
retroactivity.
the
solicitor
general
is
correct.
some
of
those
were
cases
in
which
on
collateral
review,
the
petitioner
was
seeking
to
actually
create
a
new
rule
and
apply
it
retroactively.
but
if
we
look
to
cases
such
as
the
retroactivity
application
of
batson,
for
instance,
what
this
court
has
found
is
that
the
batson
rule,
the
cross-section
of
the
community
on
a
jury,
that
the
purpose
of
that
rule
was
not
created
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
against
unjust
convictions
or
ensuring
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
batson
rule,
this
court
found
that
it
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
batson
rule,
and
that
therefore,
it
would
not
fall
under
the
teague
exception.
that
is
not
so
when
you
talk
about
the
purpose
of
the
cross-examination
rule.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
again,
in
schriro
versus
summerlin,
the
issue
there
was
an
issue
with
regard
to
ultimate
accuracy
of
a
jury
versus
a
judge.
again,
this
court
found
that
the
evidence
was...
the
evidence
was
equivocal
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
a
judge
findings
or
jury
findings
were
more
accurate.
now
you
might
say,
well,
that
sounds
a
little
bit
like
roberts.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
it
isn't
like
roberts,
because
under
roberts,
the
cross-examination
right,
which
is
something
that
we
held
so
dear
and
connected
so
directly
to
the
right
to
counsel,
having
counsel
without
the
right
to
cross-examination,
isn't
much
of
a
right.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
i
can,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
i
can
is
that
the
judge
does
not
have
the
ability
to
see
the
cross-examination
statement
either.
so
if
we
start
with
the
premise,
when
making
this
reliability
determination,
we
would
have
to
throw
out
all
of
the
statements
in
crawford
and
all
of
the
previous
cases
which
hold
so
dear
the
right
to
cross-examination
and
say,
but
a
judge
can
make
a
reliability
determination
without
ever
hearing
the
statements
cross-examined,
can
make
them
in
that
vacuum
without
ever
testing
the
reliability
of
the
statements
with
the...
with
cross-examination.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
would
be
able
to
square
that
with
the
strong
statements
that
are
made
in
crawford.
and
the
strong
statements
that
are
made
in
the
cases,
for
instance,
in
the
case
finding
that
bruton
should
be
retroactive,
because
it
goes
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process.
unlike
all
of
the
other
cases
that
you've
talked
about
since
teague,
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
what
is
at
issue
here.
do
you
have
confidence
in
a
result
which
is
based
upon
an
accuser's
statements
being
admitted
without
ever
having
been
cross-examined?
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
that's...
your
honor,
that
is
the
base
of
the
decision.
it
harkens
back
to
what
the
founders
believed.
however,
the
rule
in
roberts
was
described
variously
from
"amorphous
to
unpredictable,
to
manipulable.
"
to
saying
that
the
basis
for
the
right
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination
comes
from
a
basic
mistrust
of,
even
to
the
levels
of
a
judge
in
terms
of
assessing
the
testimony
without
the
advantage
of
an
actual
adversary
proceeding.
this
case,
of
course,
illustrates
the
dire
need
for
cross-examination
because
the
accuser
in
this
case
testified
inconsistently
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
case
and
then
was
excused
before
cross-examination
was
allowed.
the
accuser
in
this
case,
who
was
sent
to
a
counselor
by
the
district
attorney,
when
she
went
to
the
counselor
refused
to
acknowledge
that
the
incident
happened,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
counselor.
and
because
the
court...
and
the
record
is
very
scant
on
what
happened
here...
the
court,
the
trial
court
for
instance,
under
roberts
made
only
a
couple
of
findings
and
he
said
the
testimony
was
consistent...
he
didn't
look
at
the
fact
that
it
had
been
inconsistent
on
at
least
two
other
occasions...
and
said
it
was
chronological,
at
least
according
to
what
the
police
officer
said.
and
so
there
were
only
a
couple
of
findings
by
the
trial
court
at
all
with
respect
to--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--we
did.
we
did,
and
that...
and
that
issue
was
not
reached
by
the
ninth
circuit
because
after
we
had
argued
the
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
crawford
decision
was
decided;
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
ninth
circuit
picked
up
on
the
crawford,
and
they
didn't
decide
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
roberts
would
have
meant
that
this
testimony
was
unreliable
anyway.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
it
came
in
under
a
nevada
statute
which
was
patterned
after
roberts.
it
came
in
under
a
nevada
statute--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--yes,
adequate...
basically,
indicia
of
reliability.
it
didn't
go
into...
it
didn't
go
into
too
much
more
detail
than
that.
it
just
simply
required
that,
a
witness
under
ten,
the
court
must
find
that
the,
that
the
statement
is
reliable
and
the
statements
are
reliable,
and
then--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--no.
no.
that
was
a
statute
that
was
adopted
specifically
for
child
witnesses.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
children
under
ten.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
that's
correct.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
it
was.
yes,
yes.
no,
it
was.
it
was
adopted
for
witnesses
under
ten.
this
child
actually
was
quite
articulate
in
the
preliminary
hearing
and
was
able...
was
able
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
she
remembered
talking
to
the
police
officer,
that
she
remembered...
but
then,
but
then
in
terms
of
trying
to
recall
the
incident,
she
was
unable
to
recall
the
incident,
and
she
was
unable
to
recall
it
in
any
of
the
same
detail
that
the
police
officer
testified
to.
so
it
wasn't...
you
know,
it
wasn't
a
circumstance
in
which
you
had
a
child
who
simply
couldn't
speak
or
a
child
who
couldn't
describe
what
had
occurred.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
that
issue.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
yes.
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
explain
our
position
on
that
is
that
what
has
been
articulated
here
is
that
a
retroactive...
a
rule
made
retroactive
by
this
court
would
be
applicable
to
mr.
bockting
if
he
had
not
raised
this
issue
or
had
been
somehow
procedurally
defaulted
along
the
way.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
the
advantage
that
was
discussed
by
both
the
state
and
the
government
of
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
clearly
recognize,
as
to
the
extent
that
it's
relevant
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation
did,
that
you
still
have
the
power
to
make
rules
retroactive,
but
the
only
way
that
mr.
bockting
would
be
able
to
get
advantage
of
that
rule
would
be
if
the
state
court
had
never
ruled
on
the
merits
of
his
claim
or
had
made
some
sort
of
procedural
ruling
that
meant
that
he
was
defaulted
on
the
claim.
so
instead
of
mr.
bockting,
who
has
raised
this
question
of
being
able
to
cross-examine
his
accuser
from
day
one
in
the
trial,
he
cannot
have
that
rule
applied
retroactively
to
him.
if
instead
he
now,
he
goes
back
later
and
the
court
says,
no,
this
is
a
successor
petition,
you
can't,
you
can't
get
it,
you
can't
come
into
our
courtroom,
the
door
is
slammed
on
you,
according
to
the
state
now
there's
no
ruling
on
the
merits
of
his
claim,
and
that's
why
that
section
of
the
statute
would
permit
the
retroactive
rule
to
apply.
2254(d)(1),
while
it
has
the
language
clearly
established,
and
the
court
asked
some
questions
about
that,
i
think
it
must
be
remembered
that
when
that
statute
is
being
addressed,
it's
being
addressed
in
state
court...
or
in
federal
court,
on
federal
habeas.
and
so
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
is
in
federal
court,
then
the
rule
has
been
clearly
established.
the
2254(d)--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--correct.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
2254(d)(1),
i
think
the
only
way
that
you
can
read
that
section
compatibly
with
the
four
other
sections
which
are
quoted
in
our
appendix
2
of
our
brief,
the
only
way
that
you
can
do
that
is
to
recognize,
although
this
court
will
recall
that
it
has
described
aedpa
as
not
quite
a
silk
purse
of
legislative
drafting,
but
the
only
way
to
make
those
sections
compatible
is
to
say,
listen,
what
was
going
on
when
2254(d)(1)
was
written
was
we
were
talking
not
about
the
timing
of
the
new
rule,
what
we
were
talking
about
is
who
is
it
decided
by,
because
before
aedpa
was
adopted
it
wasn't
apparent
that
it
must
be
a
decision
by
you,
by
this
court,
that
established
by
the
rule.
so
that's
the
first
part.
and
the
second
part
is
that
it's
not
dicta.
it
is
an
actual
holding
of
this
court
that
is
to
be
looked
to
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
court
was
wrong.
and
so
the
only
way
to
read
that
is
to
say,
listen,
there
has
to
be
some
meaning
to
retroactivity,
and
what
does
retroactivity
mean?
retroactivity
means
like
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order,
that
when
you've
determined
that
a
new
rule
is
retroactively
applicable...
and
certainly
between
aedpa
and
the
teague
exceptions,
which
you
did
say
in
horn
versus
banks,
by
the
way,
should
be
analyzed
differently...
although
it
has
not
been
tossed
up
to
you
directly
as
it
has
in
this
case,
the
meaning
of
the
2254(d)(1),
you
have
repeatedly
advised
that
teague
is
still
alive
and
well
and
that
when
you
look
to
the
application
of
whether
a
rule
should
be
applied
retroactively
you
look
to
the
teague
exceptions,
so
we
also
look--
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
--there
is
not
language
in
2254(d)(1).
the
language...
the
reason
that
we
know
that
congress
was
cognizant
of
teague
is
that
there
is
language
throughout
aedpa,
particularly
in
the
sections
that
we've
quoted
to
you,
that
are
lifted
directly
from
teague.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
i
think
that
what
you
would
say
is
that
congress
would
not
have
deprived
you
of
the
power
to
make
a
rule
retroactively
applicable
and
would
have
not
then
created
the
ludicrous
situation
which
the
state
suggests
would
occur
here,
which
is
instead
of
the
motivation
in
congress
in
having
someone
like
mr.
bockting
raise
the
issue
from
the
very
beginning
in
one
unitary
proceeding,
as
opposed
to
going
back,
which
is
what
they've
suggested
he
must
do
in
order
to
get
the
advantage
of
a
retroactive
rule,
is
that
congress
was
cognizant
of
that
and
in
order
to
make
all
of
the
statute...
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
have
meaning
and
not
render
certain
provisions,
including
the
sections
that
we
quoted,
superfluous,
that
you
must
interpret
that
to
mean
that
the...
that
the...
that
2254(d)(1)
is
not
a
timing
statute.
it's
what
law
do
we
look
to.
that
must
be
what
they
meant.
otherwise,
the
rest
of
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
ms.
franny
a.
forsman
no.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
because
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
intent
of
2254(d)(1).
i
think
the
intent...
again,
i
think
the
intent
of
2254(d)(1)
was
in
order
to
define
what
kinds
of
decisions
the
state
court
decisions
should
be
measured
against.
there
must
be
some
kind
of
meaning
to
retroactivity,
and
retroactivity
means
that
you
are
making
this
decision
now
and
you're
making
it
retroactive
to
the
time.
it
is
not
going
to
be
many
things,
as
we
know
not
only
from
your
decisions,
but
as
we
know
from
the
very
small
core
of
decisions
that
teague
left
open.
and
it
is
those
decisions
where
we
must
worry
whether
or
not
an
innocent
man
has
been
convicted.
it
is
those
rules
that
protect
against
those...
an
unjust,
an
unwarranted,
a
wrongful
conviction.
it
is
only
those
rules
that
go
to
reliability,
that
go
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
that
you
are
going
to
let
through
that
veil.
so
if
it
is
only
that
small
core
of
rules
that
you
reserved
in
teague,
only
that
small
core
of
rules,
and
we
know
it
won't
be
many
at
this
point,
then
if
you
read
that
compatibly
with
aedpa,
it
is
not
and,
as
we
know,
it
is
not
going
to
open
the
floodgates.
there
is
a
very
defined
period
of
time
in
which
people
can
bring
actions
for
relief.
under
your
dodd
decision
decision,
there
is
only
one
year,
not
from
the
time
that
you
make...
if
you
were
to
make,
for
instance,
this
decision
retroactive,
not
from
today,
but
it
is
one
year
from
crawford
that
petitioners
have
the
opportunity
to
be
able
to
come
into
court
within
that
statute
of
limitations
with
regard
to
the
date
on
which
a
new
rule
is
adopted.
it
is
from
that
date
forward.
so
there
is
a
defined
population.
in
appendix
1
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
all
of
the
decisions
that
we
could
find
that
have
actually
applied
crawford
and
there
were
49
of
them.
and
what
you'll
find
is
that
of
the
decisions...
and
the
state
and
the
government
have
not
disputed
this...
of
the
49
decisions
which
we
were
able
to
find
at
the
time
of
the
writing
of
that
brief,
only
five
actually
resulted
in
relief.
there's
no
question
it
would
result
in
relief
here
because
there
is
no
contention
before
you
that
the
ninth
circuit's
determination
of
harmfulness...
there
is
no
determination
before
you;
they
haven't
challenged
that
to
you.
so
it
would
result
in
relief
for
mr.
bockting.
but
because
it's
harmless
error
or
it's
not
testimonial
or
there
was
a
previous
opportunity
to
cross-examine,
of
the
49
decisions
only
5
were
found
to
have
to
result
in
relief.
and
that
is
as
it
should
be.
the
state
argues
that
watersheddedness,
if
that's
a
word,
is
that
watersheddedness
must
mean
that
it
affects
many,
many
decisions.
now,
that
can't
mean
what
teague
means.
teague
can't
mean
that
my
burden
is
to
show
you
that
many
decisions
will
be
overturned.
that's
the
exact
opposite
of
what
teague
was
decided
for.
watersheddedness
has
to
do
with
the
alteration
of
our
understanding.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
the
change
of
course
as
described
by
then
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
change
of
course
that
crawford
represented
in
the
way
that
we
look
at
the
right
to
confrontation
cannot
be,
cannot
be
seen
as
precisely
the
alteration
in
the
understanding
of
this
bedrock
principle
again
directly
from
the
language
of
crawford.
we
ask
you,
your
honors,
to
make
the
rule
of
crawford
retroactive
and
to
affirm
the
determination
of
the
ninth
circuit.
