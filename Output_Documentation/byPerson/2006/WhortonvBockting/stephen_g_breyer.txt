you
can
still
argue...

hearsay
exception
did
it
come
in
under?
justice

g.
breyer
adequate
indicia
of
reliability?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
universal
in
nevada?
i
mean,
is
they
are
no
more
hearsay
rule
in
nevada,
that
you
just
evaluate
hearsay
straight
out
in
every
case?
justice
stephen

if
you
lose
this
case,
you
can
go
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
say,
well,
even
under
roberts
it
shouldn't
have
come
in?
