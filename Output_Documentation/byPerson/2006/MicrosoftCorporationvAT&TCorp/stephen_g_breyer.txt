i
take
it
that
we
are
operating
under
the
assumption
that
software
is
patentable?
we
have
never
held
that
in
this
court,
have
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
should
we
do
here?
should,
if
we
are
writing
this,
since
it's
never
been
held
that
it's
patentable
in
this
court--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
were
writing
something,
should
i
say
on
the
assumption
that
it's
patentable?
since
the
issue
isn't
raised?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
send
someone
to
the
patent
office--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
i
send
someone
to
the
patent
office,
goes
there,
picks
up
the
patent,
and
this
patent
is
written
very,
very,
very
concretely
and
specifically.
gets
on
the
phone,
phones
somebody
in
germany
and
reads
it
to
him.
and
that
person,
having
an
excellent
memory,
takes
everything
in
and
now
he
has
the
precise
instruction
necessary
to
change
the
machine
around
or
put
various
things
into
it.
so
now
it
is
a
precise
copy
of
the
machine
in
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
how
is
that
different
from
this?
how
is
it
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
we
have
a
genius...
we
have,
as
they
used
to
have
to
get
all
the
stuff
that
we
stole
from
england,
with
the...
with
the...
remember
the
weaving
machines
and
the
cotton
spinners
and
so
forth?
this
genius
comes
over
here;
he
looks
at
a
really
complex
machine;
it
is
now
stored
in
his
head,
the
precise
details
that
nobody
else
could
do.
he
runs
back
to
germany,
and
he
builds
it.
well,
he
has
absolutely
stolen
the
precise,
incredibly
complex
details
of
this
machine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
does
it
matter,
if
instead
of
sending
the
individual,
we
send
the
machine
to
germany.
this
genius
looks
at
it
in
germany
and
there
he
makes
the
copy.
are
they
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you,
how
would
you...
go
back
for
a
second,
please,
because,
if
you're
finished
with
that,
because
i
don't
see
how
to
decide
for
you
without
at
the
same
time
permitting
a
person
to
walk
over
to
the
patent
office,
to
read
that
application
and
the
description,
which
after
all
at
least
can
be
a
very
highly
detailed
set
of
instructions
of
how
to
make
a
machine,
getting
on
the
phone,
explaining
that
just
like
the
blueprint
which
it
is
just
like
to
somebody
in
europe.
they
then
make
it.
and
that
on
your
reading
would
violate
the
statute.
it
can't
be
right
that
that
would
and
you
don't
even
think
it
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
any
precedent
for
that
sort
of
thing?
that
is,
i
understand
your
point
now,
i
think,
but
however
you
put
it,
it
has
to
come
down
to
the
fact
that
this
very,
very
complex
and
detailed
thing
that
is
being
supplied
is
an
abstract
set
of
numbers.
and
i
can
understand
how
the
patent
application
does
not
itself
contain
that
set
of
numbers,
but
rather
contains
an
instruction
as
to
how
to
generate
that
set
of
numbers.
but
i
then
would
be
quite
frightened
of
deciding
for
you
and
discovering
that
all
over
the
world
there
are
vast
numbers
of
inventions
that
really
can
be
thought
of
in
the
same
way
that
you're
thinking
of
this
one,
and
suddenly
all
kinds
of
transmissions
of
information
themselves
and
alone
become
components.
so
i'm
asking
you,
is
there
any
outside
the
computer
field
analogous
instance
where
the
transmission
of
information
has
itself
been
viewed
as
the
transmission
of
a
component?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
sure,
there
is.
it's
a
bigger--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it's
totally
different
in
that
of
course
it
violates
the
patent
in
the
united
states.
the
whole
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
person
has
to
go
get
a
patent
in
germany,
which
he
can
do
or
not
do.
and
the...
the
concern
that
i'm
worried
about
is
in
the
future
it
might
be
outside
your
field,
it
might
be
in
biology,
but
if
you
suddenly
say
that
the
transmission
purely
of
information
is
the
transmission
of
a
component,
no
matter
how
detailed,
i
can
easily
see
in
biology
or
medicine
where
a
patent
has
an
instruction
and
indeed,
that
instruction
is
an
instruction
to
create
other
detailed
procedures,
processes,
dishes,
petri
dishes,
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
and
we
transmit
that
detailed
information
abroad.
then
suddenly
it's
our
patent
law
and
not
the
foreign
patent
law
that
would
govern.
that's
why
i
asked
for
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
answer
to
me
is
that...
that...
it's
sort
of
misleading
to
think
of
this
as
if
it's
just
information,
because
it's
really
a
method
that
switches
things
at
a
level
of
detail
that
is
impossible
to
put
in
a
patent
application.
it's
taking
the
information
in
a
patent
application,
it's
transforming
it
into
what
we
think
of
as
1's
and
0's,
but
they're
not
really
even
1's
and
0's.
what
they
are
is
things
that
happen
with
electricity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
putting
that
on
the
disk
and
then
it
makes
other
things
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
putting
something
physical
on
a
disk,
pits
and
lands,
instructions
that
are
copied
from
the
master
disk
and
then
put
into
either
a
hard
drive
or
a
disk,
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
something
that
is
into
the
computer
that
will
make
the
computer
operate.
you're
right,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
thought
it
was
bringing
this
statute
up
to
date
and
it
even
said
so.
we
are
making
an
extension
of
the
statute
to
keep
up
to
date
with
the
technology.
that
is
not
for
courts
to
do.
this
court
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
they
had
a
license
to
do
that,
because
if
they
didn't
have
a
license
to
make
the
master
disk
here
in
the
united
states,
the
making
of
it
would
have
violated
the
patent;
is
that
right?
