isn't
this
an
artificial
distinction
in...
when
you're
talking
about
the
making
of
a
tangible
part,
there's
at
least
some
cost
involved
in
doing
it
here
or
doing
it
abroad,
and
some
time
involved.
but
with,
with
software,
the
federal
circuit's
point
was
that
it
is
so
easy
and
inexpensive
and
fast
to
copy
it
that
simply
sending
the
information
abroad,
sending
the
object
code
abroad
in
the
form
of
the
golden
disk,
is
tantamount
to
manufacturing
copies
overseas.

if
these...
if
these
computers
are
built
abroad
and
are
sold
with
windows
installed,
the
component
is
the
electrons
on
the
hard
drive?
is
that
what,
that's
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
machine...
can
you
think
of
any
machine
other
than
a
computer
that
has
a
component
that
is
not
a
physical
thing?
