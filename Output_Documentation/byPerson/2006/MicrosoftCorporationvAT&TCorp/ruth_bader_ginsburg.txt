justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
mr.
olson,
that
is
the
position
of
at&t
as
i
understand
it,
that
what
you
call
the
object
code
appears
in
the...
in
the
computer
that
it's...
that
is
what
is
sent,
along
with
the
master
disk,
and
the
object
code
is
the
critical
component,
according
to
at&t.
in
fact,
wasn't
that
the
first
question
that
you
raised,
whether
digital
software
code,
an
intangible
sequence
of
1's
and
0's
may
be
considered
a
component
of
a
patent,
patented
invention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
depends
on
what
you
consider
the
component.
they
define
component
as
including
the,
what
you've
been
calling
the
abstract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
the
federal
circuit
say?
and
i
read
the
opinion
a
couple
of
times
and
it
was,
it
seemed
to
me
ambiguous
whether
the
federal
circuit
was
identifying
the
component
as
the
object
code
itself
or
the
master
disk.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
joseffer,
to
the,
to
the
extent
that
you
are
claiming
that
there
are
foreign
nations
that
would
have
an
interest
in
this,
usually
when
that
is
so,
hear
from
them
and
in
this
case
there
is
a
strange
silence
in
that
regard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
about
a
domestic
law
question.
one
side
is
telling
us
it's
the
component
that's
supplied,
whether
it's
the
master
disk
or
the
object
code.
and
the
other
side
says
this
is
just
like
a
blueprint,
like
a
mold,
like
a
template.
can
a
blueprint
be
patented?
can
a
mold
be
patented?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
but
patent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--windows
wasn't
around
when
this
statute
was
passed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
the
position
of
the
federal
circuit
that
deepsouth
has
to
be
brought
into
an
electronic
era,
and
so
the...
the
federal
circuit
was
taking
a
statute
that
had
a
shrimp
deveiner
in
mind
and
saying
well,
this
is
how
that
notion
should
apply
to
an
electronic
world.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
this
may,
this
may
help
focus
that
question.
suppose
the
master
disks
were
made
abroad.
you
would
be
taking
the
same
position,
would
you
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
that's
given
by
microsoft
to
one
of
its
offices
in
europe.
but
the
golden
disk
itself
is
made
abroad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
thing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
only
thing
supplied
is
this,
one
side
calls
it
abstract,
one
side
calls
it
something
else.
but
anyway,
it
is
the
series
of
0's
and
1's;
that's
the
only
thing
that's
supplied
from
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
physical
manifestation
of
it
is
done
abroad.
you
would
still
be
taking
the
position
that
you're
taking,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
a
general
rule
on
the
united
states
patent
law
that
“no
infringement
occurs
when
a
patented
product
is
made
and
sold
in
another
country.”
there
is
an
exception,
section
271(f)
of
the
patent
act,
adopted
in
1984,
provides
that
infringement
does
occur
when
one
supplies
from
the
united
states
for
combination
abroad,
a
patented
invention’s
components.
the
question
presented,
does
the
exception
stated
in
271(f)
applied
to
computer
software,
first
sent
from
the
united
states
to
a
foreign
manufacturer
on
a
master
disk
via
electronic
transmission,
then
copied
by
the
foreign
recipient
and
installed
on
computers
made
and
sold
abroad.
our
answer
is
no,
the
concrete
case
at&t
holds
a
patent
on
a
computer
capable
of
digitally
encoding
and
compressing
recorded
speech.
microsoft’s
windows
operating
system
has
the
potential
to
infringe
that
patent
because
windows
incorporates
software
that
when
installed,
enables
a
computer
to
process
speech
in
the
manner
claimed
by
the
patent.
the
instant
litigation
concerns
microsoft’s
sales
of
windows
to
foreign
computer
manufacturers.
typically,
microsoft
sends
its
foreign
customers
a
master
version
of
windows
either
on
a
disk
or
via
an
encrypted
electronic
transmission,
which
the
foreign
manufacturer
uses
to
generate
copies.
those
copies,
not
the
master
sent
by
microsoft,
are
installed
on
the
foreign
manufacturer’s
computers
the
computers
are
then
sold
to
users
abroad.
at&t
filed
suit
charging
microsoft
with
infringement
based
on
the
foreign
installations
of
windows.
by
sending
windows
to
foreign
manufacturers,
at&t
urged
microsoft
in
section
271(f)’s
words,
supplied
from
the
united
states
for
combination
abroad
components
of
at&t’s
patent
in
speech
processing
computer.
the
district
court
agreed
with
at&t
and
a
divided
panel
of
the
federal
circuit
affirmed;
we
now
reverse.
microsoft
does
not
export
from
the
united
states
the
copies
of
windows
actually
installed
on
the
foreign-made
computers
in
question.
therefore,
microsoft
does
not
supply
from
the
united
states
components
of
those
computers
and
has
not
rendered
an
infringer
by
271(f).
we
take
up
first
what
271(f)
encompasses
as
a
component
combined
abroad
to
form
a
patented
invention.
until
expressed
as
a
computer
readable
copy,
windows
indeed
any
software
detached
from
an
activating
medium
remains
un-combinable.
it
cannot
be
inserted
into
a
cd-rom
drive
or
downloaded
from
the
internet.
it
cannot
be
installed
or
executed
on
a
computer.
abstract
software
code
is
an
idea
without
physical
embodiment
and
as
such
it
does
not
match
271(f)’s
categorization,
components
amenable
to
combination.
installable
copies
of
windows
in
contrast
would
fit
271(f)’s
usage
of
the
word
component.
but
microsoft
did
not
supply
from
the
united
states
the
foreign-made
copies
of
windows
installed
on
the
computers
here
involved.
those
copies
were
supplied
from
outside
the
united
states.
the
federal
circuit
majority
observed,
however,
that
software
components
are
not
like
machine
parts.
given
the
character
of
the
technology,
the
majority
concluded
“sending
a
single
copy
of
software
abroad
with
the
intent
that
it
would
be
replicated
should
trigger
271(f)
liability
for
the
foreign-made
copies.
we
resist
the
federal
circuit
majority’s
dynamic
reading
of
271(f).
the
statute’s
text
and
the
problem
to
which
congress
responded
in
1984,
lead
us
to
conclude
that
under
271(f)
only
components
supplied
from
the
united
states
and
not
foreign-made
copies
thereof
can
trigger
liability
when
combined
abroad
to
form
the
patented
invention
at
issue.
two,
copying
software
abroad
is
both
easy
and
inexpensive,
section
271(f),
however,
contains
no
instruction
to
gauge
when
duplication
is
easy
and
cheap
enough
to
deem
a
copy
in
fact
made
abroad
nevertheless
supplied
from
the
united
states.
any
doubt
that
microsoft’s
conduct
falls
outside
271(f)’s
compass
would
be
resolved
by
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
foreign
conduct
is
generally
the
domain
of
foreign
law
and
in
the
patent
area
that
law
may
embody
policy
judgments
different
from
our
own
about
the
relative
right
of
inventors,
competitors,
and
the
public.
applied
to
this
case,
the
presumption
tugs
strongly
against
construing
271(f)
to
accomplish
as
a
component,
not
only
a
physical
copy
of
software
but
also
software’s
intangible
code
and
to
render
supply
from
the
united
states,
not
only
exported
copies
of
software
but
also
duplicates
made
abroad.
if
at&t
desires
to
prevent
copying
abroad,
its
remedy
today
lies
in
obtaining
and
enforcing
foreign
patent.
we
recognize
that
reading
271(f)
to
exclude
from
coverage
foreign-made
copies
of
software
may
create
a
loophole
favoring
software
makers.
we
are
un-persuaded
however
that
dynamic
judicial
interpretation
of
271(f)
is
in
order
to
software’s
specific
loophole,
at&t
and
the
federal
circuit
majority
have
identified
is
in
our
judgment
properly
left
for
congress
to
consider
and
to
close
if
it
finds
such
action
warranted.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
as
to
all
but
footnote
14,
in
which
justices
thomas
and
breyer
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
