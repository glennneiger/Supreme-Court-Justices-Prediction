paul

we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
05-1056,
microsoft
against
at&t.
mr.
olson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
isn't
one
of
the
questions
whether
the
software
is
really
being
copied
when
it's
transferred
from
the
golden
disk
to
the
new
manufacturer,
or
whether
it's
actually
being
supplied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
a
little
confused,
because
i
thought
the
golden
disk
was
just
one
method
of
getting
the
software
into
the
new
computers.
and
i
thought
it
was
the
software
which
was
arguably
the
component,
not
any
physical
manifestation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you...
what
is
your
view
on
whether
or
not
software
is
a
component?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
patented?
is
the
physical
object
patented
or
is
the
software
patented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
joseffer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what,
what
is
your
view
of
what
the
component
is
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
software
is
the
component?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
time
is
up,
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
yes
or
no
question.
in
your
view
is
software
patentable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
waxman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
really
what
happens?
as
i
understand
it
there
is
an
intermediate
step.
they
don't
send
it
directly
from
the
united
states
to
each
of
the
individual
computers
in
germany.
they
send
it
to
a
central
point
which
then
redistributes
it.
is
that
not
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
correct
that
they're
just
sending
from
new
york
direct
to
the
500
different
machines
all
on
one
transmission
from
new
york,
there's
no
lawsuit
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
you're
trying
to
tell
us,
that
they
do
send
it
directly
from
new
york
to
500
different
recipients
in
germany?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
violation
if
they
sent,
if
they
sent
the
golden
disk
abroad
and
nobody
ever
copied
anything
off
the
golden
disk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
send
the
golden
disk
abroad
and
never
use
it,
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
it
is
never,
it
is
never
combined?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
physical
object
does
not
have
to
originate
in
the
united
states.
can
they
not
transmit
the
commands
to
a
physical
object
in
germany
and
have
that
be
the
substitute
for
the
golden
disk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
they
now
send
to
some
central
point
which
redistributes
them.
they
send
one
copy
to,
say,
the
wholesaler,
who
then
makes
500
copies
that
are
sent
to
the
retail
customers,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
exactly
what
happens
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
if
that
is
what
happens,
when
the
retransmission
takes
place
when
one
copy
is
converted
into
500
how
can
those
500
all
be
components
rather
than
copies
of
the
single
component?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
olson,
you
have,
let's
see,
four
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
