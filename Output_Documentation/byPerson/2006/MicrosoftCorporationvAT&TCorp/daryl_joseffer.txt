mr.
daryl
joseffer
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
might
help
if
i
could
start
by
putting
this
case
into
its
context
in
both
the
united
states
and
international
patent
law.
section
271(f)
is
a
limited
extension
of
normal
territoriality
principles
that
is
designed
to
shore
up
the
prohibition
against
actually
making
a
patented
invention
in
the
united
states,
but
it
does
not
take
the
further
and
extraordinary
step
of
applying
united
states
law
to
the
conduct
of
copying
parts
abroad
for
assembly
and
sale
abroad
conduct
is
properly
the
subject
of
foreign
law.
as
a
result,
in
the
context
of
traditional
manufacturing,
for
example,
it
has
always
been
understood
pursuant
to
the
statute's
text,
that
while
companies
cannot
make
parts
in
the
united
states
for
final
assembly
abroad...
that's
too
close
to
making
it
here...
they
may
make
copies
in
a
foreign
country
by,
for
example,
sending
the
design
to
the
foreign
country
or
sending
a
specific
part
to
the
foreign
country
that
can
be
copied
there.
that
distinction
between
copying
in
the
united
states
and
copying
in
the
foreign
country
has
two
critical
dimensions.
the
first
is
that
it
protects
the
foreign
government's
sovereign
prerogative
to
establish
the
rules
of
competition
that
will
govern
companies
that
wish
to
compete
in
that
foreign
country's
markets
by
copying
their
products
abroad,
assembling
them
there
and
selling
them
there.
the
second,
which
is
the
flip
side
of
that
point,
is
that
it
enables
united
states
companies
to
compete
on
an
even
playing
field
abroad
against
their
foreign
competitors
by
manufacturing,
assembling,
and
selling
parts
abroad,
subject--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
think
that...
i
can
say...
a
couple
points
i
can
make.
one
is,
this
case
has,
has
been
viewed
because
of
the
federal
circuit's
attempt
to
tie
this
to
software
on
the
grounds
that
software
can
easily
be
copied
abroad,
i
think
this
case
has
been
somewhat
narrowly
viewed
as
a
software
case.
but
in
truth,
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
software
from
anything
else,
and
if
the
federal
circuit's
decision
was
actually
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
i
have
no
doubt
that
other
nations
would
be
quite
concerned,
like
in...
in
two
ways.
one
is
we
have
looked,
not
exhaustively
but
we
have
looked,
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
other
country
that
would
apply
its
law
in
the
circumstances
if
they
were
reversed.
in
other
words
if
a
german
condition
wanted
to
compete
in
the
united
states
subject
to
german
law
by
making
copies
here,
assembling
them
here,
selling
them
here,
germany
would
stay
out
of
that
because
it's
the
united
states'
prerogative.
also
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
nations'
patent
laws.
for
software
in
particular,
the
united
states
is
much
more
bullish
on
the
patentability
of
software-related
inventions
than
many
other
countries.
but
even
for
more
mundane
reasons,
if
we
were
talking
about
anything...
it
could
be
that
the
foreign
government
doesn't
think
that
an
invention
is
particularly
novel,
it
just
disagrees
with
us
about
that,
or
it
doesn't
think
there
is
sufficient
advance
in
the
prior
art
sufficiently
inventive
to
warrant
patent
protection.
and
if
the
foreign
country
is
going
to
make
that
determination
regarding
competition
policy
in
its
own
borders,
it's
entitled
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
not
ordinarily.
i
mean...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
you
can
certainly
copyright
something
like
that.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well
the...
no,
but
the...
i
think
the
most
important
point
here
is
that
the
components
of
patented
inventions
do
not
have
to
be
patentable.
many
patented
inventions
are
comprised
of
a
bunch
of
parts
where
the
parts
themselves
would
not
be
patentable
because
say
they
were
standard
off
the
shelf
parts.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes,
and
we
don't...
i
mean,
process
patents,
a
process
patent
is
a
series
of
steps
or
acts
for
performing
a
certain
function,
such
as
turning
rubber
into
a
tire.
we
don't
think
process
patents
are
relevant...
are,
are
covered
by
this
statute
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
and
it's
not--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--the
component
is
the,
is
the
actual
machine
readable
copy
of
software
that
is
inserted
in--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
but
the,
the...
but
like
with
anything,
you
could
say
a
computer
is
also
the
component,
but
it's
the
actual
computer,
not
you
know,
any
copy
of
the
same
computer.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
united
states
view...
i'm
not
sure
exactly
how
much
we
disagree
on
this...
but
the
united
states
view
is
that,
for
example,
a
blank
disk
is
not
a
component
of
this
invention
because
you
don't
need
a
blank
disk
to
practice
this
invention.
the...
the
actual
component
is
the
physical
substantiation,
the
physical
copy
of
the
software
that's
inserted
into
a
computer
and
if
you
get
a
disk--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
and
again
the
coded...
the
software
could
be
on
a
disk
or
it
could
be
on
some
other
technology.
it
doesn't
matter
how
it--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--and
once
it's
copied
on
to
the
hard
drive,
then
the
copy
on
the
hard
drive
is
itself
a
component.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no,
but
as
i
was
saying
before--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
think
if--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
i
think,
i
think
the
reason
that's
not
relevant
here
is
that
the
patented
invention
in
this
case
is
not
software.
it's
computer
that
has
software
loaded
into
it.
and
the
components
of
a
patented
invention
do
not
themselves
have
to
be
patented.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
ah,
if
you
wrote
it
out,
yes.
if
i
wrote
out
a
string
of
1's
and
0's
i
could
copyright
the
strings
of
1's
and
0's
that
was...
that
was
written
out
on
a
piece
of
paper.
but
the...
in
terms
of
what
the
component
is
here,
the
other
things--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
you
could
go
later
in
and
delete
that
software
off
the
hard
drive
which
confirms
that
the
software
does
have
a
separate
physical
existence
in
there.
but
the
main
point
is
that
the...
the
component
is
the,
is
the
physical
substantiation
of
the
software.
the
actual
copy
of
the
software.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
on
a
hard
disk;
doesn't
mean
it's
on
a
disk;
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
in
the
air
in
wireless
transmission.
it's
just
the
physical
copy
of
the
software.
and
you
could
have
a
situation
where
there
are
multiple
copies
of
that
same
component
in
a
computer.
one--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it's
the
physical
embodiment
of
the
software
which
in
some
instances
is
manifested
by...
by
those
electrons.
now
at&t's
contrary
view
is
that
the
abstract
code
in
the
abstract
is
the
component.
the
reason
that
can't
be
is
that
object
code
in
the
abstract
is
just
a
series
of
1's
and
0's.
in
theory
i
could
memorize
in
my
head
or
write
down
on
a
piece
of
paper.
but
that's
not
going
to
combine
with
other,
with
other
parts
to
make
a
patented
invention.
and
if
i
could
illustrate
that
with
a
simple
lock
and
key
example,
a
key
has
a
series
of
ridges
on
it
that
enable
it
to
open
a
lock.
and
that
series
of
ridges
can
be
denoted
by
a
sequence
of
numbers,
bigger
numbers
for
deeper
ridges.
but
the
component
is
the
key
that
actually
turns
the
lock,
not
the
abstract
sequence
of
ridges
on
the
key.
and
you
can
then
say
that
about
anything;
you
can
always
say
that
any
physical
product,
any
physical
part,
is
a
physical
manifestation
of
its
abstract
design.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no.
the
source
code
and
object
code
are
just
different
computer
languages
for
expressing
the
same
thing.
there
is
no...
there's
no
difference
between
them.
one
is
words
and
one
is
numbers,
but
they
mean
the
same
thing.
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
them
differently.
the
point
is
just
that
if
you
treat
the...
either
the
source
code
or
the
object
code
as
the
component,
that's
just
the
design
of
the
actual
physical
software
that
goes
into
the
computer.
if
you
did
that
you'd
have
a
vastly
different
statute
because
any
physical
part
has
a
design,
but
the
whole
point
of
the
statute
is
to
prohibit
copying
of
parts
in
the
united
states
while
permitting
copying
of
parts
abroad
for
sale
abroad.
but
if
the
design
itself
was
a
component
then
you
could
never
copy
parts
abroad
when
something
was
designed
in
the
united
states,
because
something
designed
abroad
would
always
infringe
because
the
something
designed
abroad
would
itself
be
the
component,
and
that
would
be
a
vastly
different
statute
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
intended
here,
especially
because
of
the
extraterritorial
consequences.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1984
when
software
was
certainly
present.
it's
fair
to
say
that
congress
was
not
thinking
of
software,
but
that's
further
caution
for
not
expanding
the
statute
beyond
traditional
territorial
reaches.
because
first,
this
court
has
cautioned,
has
said
that
it
should
be
cautious
in
applying
existing
electrical
property
statutes
to
new
technologies.
and
in
addition
it's
emphasized
in
deepsouth
that
the
caution
against
extraterritoriality
applies
in
this
very
context.
so
congress
is
writing
against
the
backdrop
of
normal
territorial
principles,
which
are
the
making,
using
or
selling
inventions
of
foreign
countries
subject
only
to
foreign
law,
and
against
the
backdrop
of
deepsouth,
which
has
specifically
held
that
congress
has
to
speak
clearly
to
enact
of
statute
like
this.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
and
the
reason
that
doesn't
work
in
the
statutory
text
and
policies
is
that
the
component
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
specific
part
that
goes
in
the
machine.
and
if...
and
if...
and
under
the
statute
you
have
to
let
the
company
send
the
design
abroad
to
manufacture
it
abroad,
both
to
protect
the
company's
ability
to
compete
abroad
and
to
protect
the
foreign
government's
prerogatives.
otherwise
it's
just
a
vastly
different
statute
than
the
one
that
congress
enacted.
that's
really
our
terms
of
the
politics.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
standing
alone
in
and
of
itself,
no.
