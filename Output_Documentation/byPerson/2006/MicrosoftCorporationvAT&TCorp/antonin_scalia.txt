mr.
olson,
before
you
get
into
the
merits
i
have
a
question,
a
preliminary
question.
i
understand
from
at&t's
brief
that
there
has
been
a
stipulation
entered
into
between
the
parties
after
the
judgment
below
which
preserved
microsoft's
right
to
appeal
and
prescribed
different
dollar
amounts
that
microsoft
must
pay
at&t
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
appeal.
does
that
raise
any,
any
muteness
problem?
can
you
sort
of
wager
on
the
outcome
of
an
appeal
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
two
parties
just,
you
know,
parties
that
otherwise
do
not
have
a
case
or
controversy,
bet
each
other
that
the
district
court
will
come
out
one
way
or
the
other
way
in,
in
a
trumped-up
suit.
does
that
create
a
standing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave.
it
is
a
matter
of
wager,
which
way
the
court
will
come
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any,
any
precedent
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
so,
but
is
there
a
lot
of
money
involved
depending
on
whether
you
win
or
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
at
least
the
correct
way
to
understand
component.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
patent,
you
know,
on-off,
on-off
code
in
the
abstract,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
needs
to
be
a
device.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you,
the
point
i
don't
understand
when
you
say
the...
the
component
is
the
disk
that
contains
material,
i
understand
that
because
here
is
a
separate
piece;
it's
a
disk.
you
plug
it
in;
it
has
the
information
on
it.
but
then
you
say,
if
you
put
it
on
the
hard
drive
it
becomes
the
component.
but
the
hard
drive
is
not
a
separate
thing
like
a
disk.
and
when
you
say
you
put
it
on
the
hard
drive
you
have
nothing
there
but...
but...
but
ons
and
offs.
you
have
nothing
there
but
the...
but
the
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
call,
you
know,
what?
is
it
a
separate
section
of
the
hard
drive?
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
that,
that
code
is
not
patentable,
you've
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
we
can
continue
calling
it
the
golden
disk.
it
has
a
certain
scheherazade
quality
that
really
adds
a
lot
of
interest
to
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
