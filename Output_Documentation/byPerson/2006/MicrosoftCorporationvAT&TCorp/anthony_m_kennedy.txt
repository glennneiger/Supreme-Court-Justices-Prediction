justice
anthony
m.

suppose
the
amount
were
trivial
and
you
just
wanted
to
get
a
resolution
of
this--
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
there
would
be
a
case--
with
a
controversy
problem,
i
should
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
master
disk
a
component?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
the
disk
but
not
the
information
on
the
disk
is
the
component.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
would
like
to
know
your
position.
the
golden
disk
is
or
is
not
a
component?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
copies
of
the
golden
disk
are
or
are
not
components?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
physical
manifestation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
you
could,
if
you
made
99
copies,
those
would
be
99
components.
then
if
you
used...
if
you're
going
to
make
100
machines.
if
you
used
for
your
disk
the
master
disk
for
the
last
copy,
then
that
would
have
been...
that
would...
then
the
master
disk
would
be
a
copy,
a
component
of
the
last
machine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
make
them
abroad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
disk,
if
the
golden
disk
itself
after
they
finish
the
copies,
were
used--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
hardware,
then
that
would
be
a
component.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
are
you
saying
that
neither
the
source
code
nor
the
compilation
are
a
component?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
neither
the
source
code
nor
the
compilation
are
a
component,
save
as,
the
compilation
is
put
on
a
disk?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
odd.
i
mean,
microsoft
doesn't
say
please
buy
our
disk
because
it's
the
prettiest
disk
in
the
business.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
buy
our
program
because
the
program
means
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
patent
on
a
biological
organism
and
it
was
contained
in
a
little
vial,
and
you
shipped
it
abroad.
just
by
doing
nothing
at
all,
it
grew,
and
it
had...
it
grew
into
100
different
parts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
can
be
a
process
patent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
have
you
have
a
copyright
on
a
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
analogous
to
the
source
and
the
compilation,
the
source
being
the
design,
the
compilation
being
the
key?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose,
suppose
you
had
a
machine
that
makes
another
machine,
and
if
you
ship
that
machine
to
europe...
and
there's
a
patent
for
the
machine
that
makes
it.
if
you
ship
it
to
europe
and
it
starts
making
another
machine,
the
statute
is
not
violated;
and
isn't
that
just
what's
happening
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
an
answer
to
justice
breyer,
or
maybe
it
isn't,
that
we
have
no
conceptual
problem
saying
there
would
be
liability
if
this
happened
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
there
shouldn't
be
a
greater
conceptual
problem
if
you
prevail,
in
applying
it
abroad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
infringement
act
that
happened
in
the
united
states
involved
no
components?
