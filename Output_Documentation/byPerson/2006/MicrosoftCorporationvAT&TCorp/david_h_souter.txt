justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
component
then
would
be
either
a
disk
which
is
put
into
a
computer
or
the
portion
of
the
hard
drive
to
which
the
code
is
transferred.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
this
case,
you're...
but
mr.
olson
said
the
component
is
either
the
disk
or
the
portion
of
the
hard
drive
to
which
the,
the
coded
instructions
are
transferred.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
accept
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
disk
plus
the...
plus
the
coded
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could
be
on
the
hard
drive.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
what
is
on
master
disk.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you...
and
the
reason
it
wouldn't
matter
on
your
view
is
that
the
component
is--
the
object
code
on
the
disk,
not
the
disk
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
why
doesn't
that
get
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
doesn't
that
get
you
right
back
to
the
point
that
justice
breyer
was
making?
you
are
saying,
i
think,
in
essence
if
you
send
a
blueprint...
this
is
like
a
blueprint.
it
tells,
it
tells
a
machine
which
may
be
in
europe
how
to
put
the
object
code
on
other
disks
or
on
hard
drives.
the
machine
in
europe
is
following
instructions
just
the
way
an
artisan
would
follow
a
blueprint.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
"continuously"
does
not
describe
the
process
of
going
from
the
master
disk
to
what
you
claim
to
be
the
infringing
computer
sold
in
europe.
there
is
no
continuous
process
there.
as
i
understand
it,
what
happens
is...
let's
just
take
the
master
disk
and
forget
the
photon
for
the
moment.
the
master
disk
functions
like
a
blueprint.
they
send,
from
the
united
states
they
send
the
blueprint
to
europe.
the
blueprint
is
put
in
some
kind
of
a
machine
in
europe.
and
by
the
use
of
the
blueprint
the
machine
puts
electrical
charges
on
a
disk
or
on
a
hard
drive,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
does
bear
out
the
blueprint
analogy.
and
if
it
does,
then
any
export
of
a
blueprint
or
indeed
the
simple
export,
the
simple
sending
of
the
'820,
if
that's
the
right
number,
patent
in
this
case
would
be
a
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
case
for
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
is
it
that
they
export
and
send
overseas?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
it's
a
thing.
it's
an
object
of
some
sort,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
an
object
that
has
coded
onto
it,
transferred
to
it
in
a
readable
way,
those
commands.
but
it's
an
object,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
can
perfectly
well
say
that
in
this
case.
you
can
say
that
the
instruction
is
exhausted
once
the
golden
disk
has
sent
its
information
through
an
intermediary
machine
onto
the
new
disk
that
is
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
simply
means
that
after
the...
the...
the...
the
idea
as
you
put
it,
has
been
placed
on
the
hard
drive,
certain
other
processes
must
take
place
too
before
we
get
the
result
that
people
are
buying
computers
to...
to
obtain.
but
it's
still
the
case
that
the...
that
the
code
on
the
golden
disk
is
exhausted
once
that
has
been
transferred
from
the
disk
through
an
intermediary
machine
on
its
way
ultimately
to
a
working
computer
just...
and
my
only
point
is...
just
the
way
you
can
say
that
the
blueprint
in
effect
is
exhausted
once
the
house
has
been
built.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
you
can
use
it
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
object
code
has
several
jobs.
one
job
when
embodied
on
the
golden
disk
is
tell
a...
is
to
tell
a
machine
how
to
make
disks
or
how
to
put
a
message
on
a
hard
drive.
another
job
that
the
object
code
has
is
when
the
object
code
gets
on
the
resulting
disk
or
the
hard
drive.
but
in
fact,
the
manifestation
of
the
object
code
on
the
golden
disk
and
the
manifestation
of
the
object
code
on
the
resulting
disk
are
separable,
just
as
the
blueprint
is
separable
from
what
is
constructed.
