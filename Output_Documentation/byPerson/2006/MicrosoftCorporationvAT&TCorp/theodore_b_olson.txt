mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
limited
monopoly
granted
by
u.s.
patent
laws
protects
against
the
making,
using
or
selling
a
patented
invention
within
the
united
states.
section
271(f)
also
makes
it
an
infringement
to
make
components
of
a
patented
invention
within
the
united
states
and
then
simply
ship
them
abroad
for
reassembly.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
by
no
means
a
trumped-up
suit.
it's
a
very
serious
suit.
the
outcome,
the
judgment,
the
amount
of
damages
that
must
be
paid
is
not
a
matter
of
wager.
it
depends
upon
the
decision
of
a
matter
of
law
of
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
an
entirely
legitimate,
i
submit,
means
by
which
parties
may
preserve
a
legal
issue
depending
upon
how
a
legal
question
is
decided.
the
only
thing
that's
been
resolved
is
the
amount
that
will
be
paid
as
damages
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
the
appeal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that
it
happens
frequently,
especially
in
criminal
cases
where
there
is...
someone
pleads
guilty
in
and
preserving
a
right
to
appeal
a
certain
issue.
i
don't
have
a
case
to
cite
to
you
but
it
strikes
me
as
quite
understandable
that
the
parties
might
agree
if
the
outcome
of
the
legal
question
that
the
judge
might
decide
is
going
to
be
x,
then
the
consequence
will
be
a
liability
for
y.
if
it's...
if
it's
of
the
opposite
outcome,
the
outcome
will
be
different.
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
if
the
amount--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
know
what
the
court
might
mean
by
the
word
trivial,
justice
kennedy,
but
this
is
a
very
significant
major
amount
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
the
parties
are
very
serious.
it's
a
very
significant
legal
question
with
respect
to
the
interpretation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
the
limitation
of
in
section
271(f)
that
the
components,
there's...
liability
of
the
components
are
created
here,
and
reassemble
the
broad.
the
federal
circuit
held
that
foreign
made
tangible
reproductions
of
computer
operating
code
installed
in
foreign-made
computers
may
be
components
which
are
deemed
or
essentially
supplied
from
the
united
states,
because
copying
is
part
and
parcel
of
software
distribution,
and
thus
subsumed
in
the
act
of
supplying.
under
this
ruling,
u.s.
companies
may
be
held
liable
for
patent
infringement
whenever
their
products
are
copied
or
replicated
abroad.
this...
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
the
position
of
respondents
requires
reworking
several
words
in
the
statute.
the
statute
says
supplied
from
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
well,
it
might
be
deemed
supplied
from
the
united
states
after
it's
copied
abroad.
the
respondent
takes
the
words
"such
components"
in
the
statute
and
reads
them
as
not
the
same
components.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
being
copied.
there
isn't
any
question
that
it's
being
copied,
justice
stevens.
the
stipulation
which
is
in
pages
44-a
through
47-a
of
the
petition
appendix
contains
the
words...
this
is
words
to
which
respondent
stipulated...
foreign-made
copies
replicated
object
code,
foreign
manufactured
copies,
foreign
replicated
object
code.
what
happens,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
golden
master
of
the
disk
which
contains
the
physical
manifestation
of
the
object
code
is
read
by
a
machine
somewhere
outside
the
united
states,
looked
at
and
then
copied
onto
another
physical
medium,
either
a
hard
drive
or
a
disk.
many
hard
drives,
many
disks.
those
foreign
replicated
physical
tangible
copies
are
then
installed
in
computers
and
they
become
components
of
those
computers.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
master...
well,
at&t
has
taken
two
positions
on
that.
we--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--our
position
is
that
it's
not
a
component
of
the
final
product
computers
that
are
made
abroad.
what
is
a
component
is
a
replication,
a
copy
of
a
new
hard
drive
or
a
new
disk
that's
made
a
part
of
those
computers
which,
without
which--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
information
on
the
disk
is
of
no
use
to
the
computer
unless
it's
made
into
a
physical
machine
readable
document...
object.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
at&t
has
taken
two
positions.
the
most
recent
position
is
that
it's
the
intangible
object
code,
the
series
of
1's
and
0's,
or
instructions
to
a
computer
switch
to
be
on
or
off,
that
is
a
component.
they
also
took
a
position
earlier
in
the
case
and
which
is
referred
to
in
the
stipulation
that
it
was
the
golden
master,
the
physical
manifestation
on
the...
on
a
master
disk
that
went
abroad
that
was
the
component.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
not
a
component--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
copies,
the
physical
manifestation
on
a
hard
drive--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--our
components
of
the
foreign
manufactured
computers.
those
components
are
not
supplied
from--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if...
well,
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
question,
if
you
make...
and
it
depends
upon
where
you
make
it,
where
you
transfer--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
you
make
it
abroad,
that...
and
it's...
that
is
where
the
component
is
supplied
from.
copies
are
made
abroad.
there's
no
question
about
that
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
the
physical--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
that
physical
golden
disk
were
actually
put
into
a
computer
and
used
without
more.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
why
i
said
at&t
has
taken
two
positions.
here's
the
position
that
they
took
in
their
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals.
three
decades
of
patent
jurisprudence
have
authoritatively
recognized
software
to
be
a
physical
and
structural
component
of
patented
machines.
the
problem,
justice
stevens--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the...
if
i
may
answer
that
by
saying
that
people
use
the
word
"software"
in
two
different
ways.
one
of
which,
they
use
it
as
the
intangible
series
of
1's
and
0's.
we
submit
that
the
correct
way
to
understand
the
word
"software"
is
the
physical
manifestation
of
that
what
is
called
source
code,
which
is
made
into
object
code,
which
is
made
into
machine
readable
code.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
the
correct
way
to
understand
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
as
i
understand
it,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
the
stipulations
make
this
clear,
there's
a
reference
in
the
stipulations
to
encoded
transmissions
but
there's
a...
but
the
parties
also
agree
that's
the
same
process
as
the
golden
disk.
the
golden
disk
is
sent
abroad.
that
is
read
by
a
machine
and
then
the
machine
understands...
it's
almost
as
if
you
were
to
read
physically
any
other
type
of
document,
read
it
to
a
machine.
the
machine
understands
what
is
said,
puts
it
into
a
physical
manifestation
on
a
disk
or
on
a
hard
drive.
many
copies
are
made
in
that
fashion.
they
are
installed
in
computers
made
abroad,
sold
to
foreign
purchasers.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
of
the
foreign?
the
language
of
the
statute
is
the
foreign
manufactured
product.
those
are
the
computers
that
are
sold
abroad.
it
is
our
position
that
the
only
components
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case
are
the
physical
manifestations
of
the
object
code
on
a
hard
drive
or
on
a
disk.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
and
the...
the
thing
that's
on
the
disk
in
the
foreign--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
program
is
nothing
until
made
into
a
physical
manifestation
that
can
be
made
by
the
computer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
at&t
patent--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
'580
patent
is
a
program,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
married
to
a
computer,
has
to
be
married
to
a
computer
in
order
to
be
patented.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
an
idea
or
a
principle,
two
plus
two
equals
four
can't
be
patented.
it
has
to
be
put
together
with
a
machine
and
made
into
a
usable
device.
the
bind
that
at&t
is
in
here
is
that
the
components
that
make
the
machines
run
that
are
produced
abroad
are
not
supplied
from
the
united
states.
they
are
made
in
belgium
or
frankfurt
or
something.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
have
attempted,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect,
to
have
it
both
ways.
they've
said
that
it
is
a
physical
and
structural
thing,
something
that's
on
the
golden
master
disk.
and
then
they
say
it's
just
the
binary
code
in
the
abstract,
but
that
in
the
abstract
never
becomes
a
part
of
the
computer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
i
agree
with
you.
the
federal
circuit
was
ambiguous,
in
part
because
there
were
two
separate
decisions.
the
court
considered
the
component
issue
in
the
eolas
case
and
then
when
this
case
came
along,
said
we've
already
decided
the
component
portion
of
the
statute;
now
we
must
decide
the
supplied
from.
so
the
language
which
the
federal
circuit
used
is
a
bit
confusing.
basically
what
it
said,
though,
is
that
the
act
of
supplying
embraces
the
act
of
copying.
that
means
that
any,
any
company
sending
a
machine
or
a
patented
product
abroad,
that
that
machine
must
be
copied
in
order
to
be
mass
produced
abroad.
it
might
be
a
pill.
it
might
be
a
mousetrap.
it
might
be
a
buick.
that
exact
identical
copy
if
replicated
abroad
does
not
violate
the
statutes,
the
patent
laws,
it
doesn't
constitute
an
infringement.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
it
reproduces
itself,
justice
kennedy,
somewhere
outside
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
you're
suggesting
is
that
there
is
a
pattern
or
a
recipe
or
a
template
or
a
mold.
it
could
be
the
same
thing.
if
it's
reproduced
outside
the
united
states
by
some
laboratory
outside
the
united
states,
then
the
components
are
not
being
sent
from
the
united
states
for
reassembly
abroad.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
there
are
three
answers
to
that.
surely
the
patent
laws
cannot
be
determined
according
to
whether
it's
easy
or
fast
or
efficient
to
replicate
something.
there
has
to
be
a
line
that
makes
some
sense.
number
two,
it
may
be
fast
and
efficient
but
there
are
certainly
costs
involved
in
taking
the
machines
to
do
it.
number
three,
where
would
that
take
us?
a
design...
every
product
contains
its
own
manifestation
of
its
design.
that
would
take
us
everywhere,
because
any
product
can
be
copied
abroad.
however...
and
maybe
there
are
going
to
be
fast
ways
to
produce
other
things.
these
are
replicas,
reproductions,
copies.
these
are
not
such
components
that
are
supplied
from
the
united
states.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
i--
mean
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
i
was
about
to
address
justice
scalia
and
recite
the
case...
cite
the
case
nixon
versus
fitzgerald,
which
is
directly
responsive
to
the
question
justice
scalia
raised
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
audience,
that
a
stipulation
with
respect
to
damages
does
not
make
a
case
moot.
and
also
with
respect
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
scalia,
or
a
comment
made
by
him,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
gold.
it's
a
master
disk.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
this
essentially
comes
down
to
is
something
that
mr.
waxman
repeatedly
said.
it
is
the
commands
that
are
a
component.
the
commands
to
the
individual
foreign
made
computers.
those
are...
those
commands
cannot
be
understood
and
cannot
be
used
by
that
computer
unless
they
are
in
a
physical
medium
that
is
created
as
a
copy
of
the
master
disk
that
sends
abroad...
that's
sent
abroad.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
the
stipulation
is
full
of
the
word
"copies",
foreign
replicated
copies.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
something
that
is
recreated.
and
justice
breyer,
your
question
about
someone
who's
got
a
really
good
memory
and
can
go
abroad
and
recite
the
1's
and
0's,
pictures
can
be
taken,
copies
can
be
made
in
lots
of
different
ways.
and
in
response
to
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
right.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
agree.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
infringement
that
happened
in
the
united
states
which
was
under
section
b,
which
provides
section
b
inducement
liability
for
making
copies
domestically
of...
the
same
thing
that
happened
here.
copies
of
the
object
code
were
put
on
physical
mediums
and
sent
to
domestic
manufacturers.
domestic
reproduction
constitutes
infringement
under
section
271(b)
but
foreign
reproduction
is
not
a
violation
of
section
271(a)
or
271(b).
hence,
we're
talking
about
the
two
sections
where--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
making
of
the
master
disk
if
actually
used
in
a
computer
with
a
microphone
and
a
speaker,
and
that's
the
liability
that
existed
in
the
stipulation
under
271(a).
making
copies
is
liability
domestically
under
271(b).
if
it's
going
to
be
liable
for
foreign
made
replications,
then
it
must
be
under
271(f).
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
submit
is
clear.
physical
things
must
be
components
under
271(f)
because
they
must
be
supplied
from
somewhere.
ideas
have
no
physical
from.
they're
in
the
air.
the
words
used,
"supplied
from"
tells
us
that
it
must
be
a
physical
thing
combined
with.
ideas
don't
combine
with
physical
things
to
make
a
patented
invention.
physical
things
do.
thank
you,
your
honor.
