mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
question
that
microsoft
supplies
the
windows
object
code,
that
is
the
precise,
machine
readable
sequence
of
commands
that
instructs
a
computer's
processor.
from
the
united
states,
that
is
paragraph
7
of
the
stipulation.
there
is
likewise
no
question
that
it
does
so
with
the
intent
that
precisely
the
same
sequence,
which
runs
to
millions
of
lines
of
binary
digits,
will
be
installed
and
stored...
those
are
microsoft's
words...
in
foreign
computers
precisely
so
that
they
may
practice
at&t's
invention.
those
facts
resolve
this
case
because
it
is
thus
entirely
consistent
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
statute
to
say
that
microsoft
has
quote,
at&t's
invention.
now
let's
look
at--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
not
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
very
different
than
this
case
because
what...
first
of
all,
we
all
agree
that
software
code
in
and
of
itself,
removed
from
a
physical
structure,
cannot
be
patentable
and
when
software...
when
some...
when
an
invention
that
is
practiced
with
software
is
patented,
at
the
most
what
you
will
see
is
preferred
embodiments
of
the
source
code
which
is
language
that
humans
understand
and
which
computers
do
not.
a
lot
of
work
has
to
be
done
in
items
of
debugging
and
testing
and
compiling
to
create
what
is,
by
stipulation,
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
the
precise,
machine
readable
sequence
that
commands
a
computer's
cpu
millions
of
times
a
second.
source
code
would
do
nothing.
source
code
has
to
be
worked
on
overseas.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--when
you're
talking...
when
you're
talking
about
sending
designs
over
or
blueprints
or
management
instructions
or
a
high
level
version
of,
gee
let's
have
a
code
that
will
perform
the
following
functions,
and
you
have
people
design
and
make
and
compile
and
test
and
debug
that
code
overseas,
of
course
that
component,
the
component
is
the
object
code,
the
precise
commands
that
reside
in
the
computer
and
continually
interact
with
the
hardware
of
the
computer
in
a
way
i'm
going
to
describe
and
is
not
disputed,
millions
of
times
a
second.
let's
take
this
case.
okay.
is
it...
the
question
is,
is
it
a
component
and
whether
what
was
supplied
was
in
fact
combined.
that's,
that's...
that's
what
this
case
boils
down
to.
as
to
the
component.
we
have
something,
software
program,
the
netmeeting
and
sound
recorded
program
that
can
in
its
object,
its
machine
readable
command
form,
is
developed,
bought
and
sold
entirely
separately
from
any
hardware
that
it
commands.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
that
is
what
is
either
on
the
master
disk
or,
although
either
side
obscures
this,
that
is
what
is
represented
in
the
electric...
electronic
transmission,
that
is
another
means
by
which
the
code
is
supplied.
and
in
paragraph
7
of
the
stipulation
microsoft
acknowledges
that
it
supplies
the
windows
object
code
by
transmitting
it
to
manufacturers
overseas.
and
the
way
that
happens
is
the
code,
the
machine
language,
is
resident
in
redmond,
either
in
the
pits
and
lands
of
a
cd
or
on
the
varying
magnetic
orientations
of
a
hard
drive,
and
a,
some
engineer
from
microsoft
presses
a
button
and
it
is
essentially,
it
is
taken
and
converted
into
photons
which
stream
whatever
it
is,
7,000
miles,
under
the
land
and
under
the
atlantic
ocean
and
emerges
into
a
machine,
a
computer,
a
bit
of
otherwise
inanimate
parts
that
are
sitting
there
in
dusseldorf,
where
it
is
loaded
onto
the
hard
drive,
it's
converted
from
photons
to
a
series
of
electrical
pulses.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that
paragraph
7
of
the
stipulation,
it
doesn't
specify
one
way
or
the
other,
but
their
case,
justice
stevens,
depends
upon
the
following.
because
if
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
give
you
two
examples--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
and
it
wouldn't...
what
i'm
saying
is
there
is
at
least
one
violation
of
271(f)
here.
271(f)
looks
exclusively
at
what
is
done
in
the
united
states.
it
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
271(f)
what,
if
anything,
is
done
overseas.
the
federal
circuit
has
made
this
clear
in
the
waymark
case
and
it's
consistent
with
the
language.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
they
sent
the
golden
disk
abroad
or
if
the
microsoft
engineer--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
i
am.
the
answer
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
they
had
the
necessary
intent
and
purpose.
they
had
to
have
had
the
specific
intent
and
purpose
that
it
be
combined
in
order
to
create
a
device
that
wouldn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
wouldn't
matter.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
could
be--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here's
the
difference.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
it's
nicely
embodied
in
microsoft's
reply's
use,
repeated
use
of
the
word
"antecedent".
a
blueprint
or
a
design
is
a
precursor
to
the
actual
device.
it
is
the
instructions
about
how
to
make
something.
it's
not
the
thing
itself.
and
here
what
we
have
is
the
object
code
that
is
the
precise
commands
that,
unlike
design
information,
interact
continuously
with
the
hard
drive
and
with
the
processor
in
order
to
make
physical
changes
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
to
disagree,
justice
souter,
because
the
blueprint...
the
patent
is
not
the
actual
series
of
commands
that
runs
the
machine
and
neither
is
the
blueprint.
the
blueprint
is
instructions,
to
be
sure,
and
it
can
be
reflected
in
intangible
code,
but
it's
instructions
about
how
to
make
something
and
once
it's
made
it's
done.
you
can
say,
as
mr.
olson
did,
that
the
design
is
embodied
in
the
thing
that
is
made.
the
blueprint
for
a
semiconductor
chip
in
some
sense
is
always
reflected
in
that
chip.
but
if
you
don't
like
the
chip
you
have
to
get
rid
of
it.
software
can
be...
if
you
don't
like
microsoft
word,
you
can
download
it
and
you
can
delete
it
and
download
wordperfect
and
use
that.
and
what
happens
in
the
computer...
and
i
think
this
does
bear
on
what
the
nature
of
the
component
is
and
why
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
"component"
and
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
words
"supply"
and
"combine",
they
apply
naturally
to
what
microsoft
does.
i
mean,
is
a
disk,
is
a
typewriter,
is
a
screen,
is
a
hard
drive,
is
a
cpu
a
component?
are
they
components
when
they
have
the
code
embedded
in
it?
of
course.
but
that
doesn't...
a
tire
doesn't
become
not
a
component
of
a
car
just
because
a
tire
with
a
wheel
attached
to
it
is
also
a
component.
the
question
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
this
is
not
a
machine
tool.
the
thing
that
was
violated,
the
machine
readable
object
code,
is
precisely
what
is
installed
on
the
computer
and
precisely
what
is
moved
from
one
part
of
the
computer
to
another
in
different
forms
as
the
computer
operates
and
it
continually
instructs.
this
is
dynamic.
it's
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
breyer,
there
is
a
long,
long
spectrum
with
respect
to
software
that
goes,
goes
from
high
level
system
architecture
to
all
the
way
down
through
component
architecture,
pseudo
code,
source
code,
which
is,
which
is
a
description
that
humans
understand,
and
the
actual
machine
language
that
a
computer
will
understand.
invention...
patents
do
not
specify
machine
language.
the
machine
code
is
totally
dependent
on
what
type
of
processor
it's
relating
to
and
somebody
who
takes
source
code...
i
could
make
an
argument
that
if
you
take,
steal
the
microsoft
source
code,
which
is
the
crown
jewel,
it
is
the
greatest
trade
secret
of
this
country,
it
will
not
be
sent
overseas,
but
if
somebody
took
it
with
a
bunch
of
smart
engineers
and
said,
you
know,
convert
this
into,
convert
this
into
something
a
computer
will
understand
that
will
combine
with
a
computer,
that
involves
a
question
of
whether
what's
going
on
overseas
is
manufacture
as
opposed
to
assembly.
look
at
it
from
the
perspective...
maybe
this
helps.
let's
look
at
the
question
from
the
perspective
of
microsoft,
the
oem,
and
the
user
overseas.
object
code
is
the
end
of
microsoft's
manufacturing
process.
that
is
what
they
make.
they
don't
make
hard
drives,
they
don't
make
disks,
they
don't
make
computers.
they
fully
finish
their
product,
the
windows
operating
code,
and
then
send
it
overseas.
the
oem
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
code
is
not
patentable.
the
expression
is
copyrightable.
at&t
has
not
sought
to
get
a
patent
on
the
code.
at&t
has
a
patent
on
a
system
that
can
be
practiced,
among
other
ways,
through
the
use
of
software.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
export
in
a
variety
of
different
physical
forms--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
an
intangible
sequence
of
commands
that
is
carrying--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it's
not
necessarily
an
object.
i
don't
know
whether
you
would
call
a
stream
of
photons
that
is
constantly
repeated
under
the
atlantic
ocean
an
object.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if...
that
depends
how
it
were
made.
if
it
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
question
is
what
is
made.
if
making
it
means
somehow
creating,
reconfiguring
the
precise
sequence
of
commands--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
the,
if
the
object
code
itself,
the
very
precise
sequence
that
can't
be
changed,
is
supplied
from
the
united
states--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
act
is
implicated.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
regardless
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
yes,
except
that
the
intangible
sequence
of
commands
can
only
be
carried
in
the
form
of,
by
attaching
it
to
a
physical
platform
or
a
bucket.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
even
a
radio
wave.
microsoft
has
patent
claims
for
software.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
of
course,
and
they
do
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
press
a
button
and
they
have
an
electronic
transmission
that
sends
a
stream
of
protons
under
the
atlantic
ocean
and
are
changed
into
electrical
impulses
that
are
used
to
inscribe
the
precise
code
onto
a
hard
drive
in
the
form
of
electromagnetic
pulses.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
may
be.
we
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
one
of
the
things
that
happens
in
this
case.
we
have
a
stipulated
record
that
is
not
very
detailed,
but
in
that
instance
there
is
only
one
violation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
only...
i
have
two
answers
to
that
question,
both
of
them
i
think
directly
answering
your
question.
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
violated
only
when
the
precise
object
code
is
expatriated
from
the
united
states,
when
it
is
supplied
from
the
united
states.
that's
the
violation.
the
other
issues
are
damages,
what
damages
are
you
entitled
to.
what
is
combined
with
the
computer
is
the
precise
thing
that
is
supplied
because
it
is
the
precise
sequence
of
commands.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
in
the
lower
courts,
microsoft
was
arguing
that
the
biotech
industry
was
an
analogy,
but
there
is
some
very
obvious
differences
between
what
is
supplied
in
terms
of
object
code
that
instructs
a
machine
and
a,
you
know,
a
sequence
of
nucleotides,
the
abstract
sequence
of
nucleotides.
but
i
think
we
need
to
be
quite
precise
here.
we
are
not
complaining
that
the
component
is
an
idea.
we're
not
complaining...
we're
not
arguing
that
a
component
is
some
form
of
information.
what
we're
saying
here
is...
i
mean,
nobody
is
paying
billions
of
dollars
from
an
idea.
when
the
commands
are
loaded
onto
the
hard
drive
of
a
computer
in
the
form
of
electromagnetic
orientations
and
when
you
press
a
button
saying
give
me
netmeeting,
and
the
processor
says...
and
this
is
what
electrical
engineers
say...
fetch
the
instructions,
fetch
the
commands
to
the
random
access
memory
where
it's...
where
it
is
there
reflected
in
a...
in
a
form
of
patterns
of
electrical
charges.
and
when
the
code
then
moves
back
and
forth,
the
instructions
move
back
and
forth
from
the
cpu
and
ram,
they...
they...
millions
of
times
a
second
they
are
replicating
themselves.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
can,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
answer
your
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
first
of
all,
this
statute
does
not
reach
anything
that
is
done
overseas.
it
doesn't
reach
what
the
german
oem
does.
it
doesn't
reach
what
anybody
does
overseas.
it...
it
makes
liable
as
an
infringer
somebody
who
supplies...
who
is
in
the
united
states
who
supplies
from
the
united
states
a
component
with
the
intent,
with
the
express
intent
that
that
component
be
combined
in
a
way
to
create
a
device
that
would
practice
a
u.s.
patent.
now
i
don't
believe...
i
firmly
am
confident
that
if
you
look
at
what's
at
issue
in
this
case,
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
questions
about
what
is
or
isn't
a
component.
i
might
think
that
a
design
is
a
component
or
it
isn't
a
component,
but
think
of
these
three
features:
one,
this
is
something
that
is
totally
modular.
it
is
developed,
bought
and
sold
entirely
independent
of
any
of
the
hardware
to
which
it
is,
with
which
it
is
combined,
and
between
which
it
moves
continuously
as
it
operates.
number
two,
it
can
be
removed
or
updated
entirely
independently
of
the
other
components.
and
it
is
dynamic,
unlike
designs,
unlike
molds,
unlike
instructions
about
how
to
make
something,
all
of
which
are
exhausted.
they
have
done
their
work
when
the
thing
is
made.
that's
why
those
things
are
called
hardware.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
these
are
instructions
not
about
how
to
make
something.
they
are
instructions
about
what
the
other
things
that
are
made
should
do
and
how
they
do
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
could
not
say
that
because
if
you
take
the
information
from
a
golden
master
or
a
stream
of
photons
and
put
it
on
a
hard
drive,
unless
that
continues
to
move
and
change
in
form,
the
computer
will
not
work.
the
computer
operates
by
having
you
press
a
button
saying
do
this
function.
the
central
processing
unit
then
says
where
are
my
instructions
on
how
to
do
it.
it
says
find
them
and
put
them
in
random
access
memory,
where
it
is
then
replicated
in
the
form
of
patterns
of
electrical
charges,
quite
a
different
physical
form
than
it
exists
on
the
hard
drive.
and
the
program
counter--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
not
because
the
blueprint
has
no
further
work
to
do.
it
was
something
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--something
you
teach,
has
no
further
work
to
do
with
respect
to
the
infringing
device,
but
the
object
code
works
continuously
and
gives
continuous
instructions
to
the
various
hardware
components
completely
unlike.
but
let
me
go
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
souter,
just
taking
your...
taking
that
as...
that
as
the
case,
the
united
states
in
footnote
2
of
its
brief
repeats
what
microsoft
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
which
is
that
if
it
took
instead
of
one
golden
master,
but
100,000
cds,
which
is
what
a
golden
master
is,
one
for
each
computer,
that
would
be
a
271(f)
infringement.
but
that
also
requires
copying
and
transforming
the
code
that
is
on
the
cd-rom
which
is
in
the
form
of
physical
pits
and
lands
and
indentations,
and
downloading
it
into
the
hard
drive
where
the
same
exact
sequence
is
manifested
as
varying
orientations
of
electronic,
electromagnetic
fields,
and
that
is
no
different
whatsoever
than
this
case.
if
you
say,
well,
what
destroys
you
in
this
case
is
that
the
code
has
to
be
copied,
replication,
precise
instantaneous
replication
is
simply
how
software
works.
it's
not
just
how
it's
supplied.
it's
not
just
how
it's
combined.
it's
how
it
interacts
dynamically
within
the
computer.
and
that's
why
we
say
it's
a
component.
let
me
just
be
clear
about
what
the
statutory
interpretation
question
here
is.
it's
not
as
whether
our
conception
of
the
component
as
the
code...
as
the...
as
the
command
is
better
than
their
conception
of
the
component
as
a
cd
or
a
light
wave
or
a
telephone
wire
that
contains
that.
the
question
is,
there
may
very...
it
may
very
well
be
both
things.
the
question
is
whether
the
word
component
naturally
applies
to
what
we
do.
and
our...
we
have
given
dozens
of
references
to
the
use
of
intangible
software,
program
software
as
components.
we
have
given
you
the
dictionary
definition
with
an
example
from
webster's.
they
have
not
responded
with
one
counter-example.
the
only
dictionary
example
they
provide
you
relates
to
the
word
5.
but
they
have
given
you
not
the
first
definition
of
such
under
black,
in
black's
eighth,
they
have
given
you
the
second
one.
the
first
one
is,
of
this
or
that
kind,
she
collects
a
variety
of
things.
and
that
definition,
under
that
definition
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you
said,
well,
the
component
has
to
be
physical
or,
you
know,
it
could
be
either.
because
even
if
it
has
to
be
physical--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
can't.
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me,
i
mean...
and
there
are...
there
are
machines
that
have
nonphysical
things
in
them
but
not
that
operate
in
the
sort
of
same
dynamic
way.
we
gave
the
example
of
the
intangible
text
of
moby
dick
in
a
book.
and
they
give
the
example
of,
you
know,
an
incredibly
complicated
series
of
circuits
on
a...
on
a
chip.
but
those
don't
continue
to
operate
and
interact
in
the
way
that
this
paradigmatic
component
does.
thank
you.
