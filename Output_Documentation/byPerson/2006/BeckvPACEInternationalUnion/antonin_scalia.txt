justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
baker,
i
thought
your
position
in
your
briefs,
and
i
don't
know
why
you
do
not
make
this
reply
to
this
exchange,
is
that
the
merger
with
another
plan
is
not
a
termination,
isn't
that
your
basic
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
it
were
a
termination,
in
a
termination,
you
must
distribute
the
assets
to
the
participants.
and
here
when
you
merge
with
somebody
else,
the
assets
are
not
distributed
to
the
participants,
but
they
are
thrown
into
a
pot
with
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
like
to
hear
that
he
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it's
a
simpler
argument
than
this
first
one
we've
been
wrestling
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
this
argument
would
not
have
any
force
whatever
if
indeed,
transferring
the
assets
to
another
plan
does
not
constitute
a
termination
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
first
step
would
be
the
transfer.
and
at
that,
at
that
stage
it
would
not
be
a
termination
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
within
the
authority
of
the
administrator
under
this
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
that
still
does
not
convert
the
termination
decision
into,
into
a,
an
administrator's
decision,
rather
than
a
sponsor's
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
you
can
oversee
it
and
make
sure
that
there
is
no
hanky-panky
going
on
in
the
two-step
process
but
the...
but
the
determination
whether
to
terminate
or
not
is
a
sponsor's
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they,
but
they
don't
say
that
in,
in
looking
at
the
two
of
them,
you
suddenly
transform
the
decision
whether
to,
to
transfer
as...
as
a
termination.
you
transfer
that
decision
from
the
plan
sponsor
to
the
administrator.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and...
and
the
argument
your
adversaries
make
is
that
termination
requires
that
the
plan
assets
be
distributed
to
the
beneficiaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
in
the
case
of
a
merger
the
assets
are
not
distributed
to
the
beneficiaries,
they
are
distributed
to
this
new
plan,
which
benefits
not
only
the
beneficiaries
of
this
plan
but
the
beneficiaries
of
other
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
now,
does
indeed
the
transfer
here
meet
the
requirement
of
little
(i)?
does
the
transferee
plan
undertake
an
irrevocable
commitment
to
provide
to
these
beneficiaries
all
that
they're
entitled
to,
even
at
the
expense
of
some
of
the
other
beneficiaries
of
that
plan?
in
other
words,
if
the
plan's
investments
go
south
does
that
plan
have
the
authority
to
say,
oh,
you
know,
our
first
payments
have
to
go
to
the
beneficiaries
under
this
plan
that
was
transferred
and
the
rest
of
you
will
get,
will
get
the
leavings?
i
don't
think
that
the
plan
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
make
a
commitment,
a
commitment
to
fully
provide
all
benefit
liabilities
under
the
now
deceased
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
said
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
argument
was
waived,
or
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think,
i
just
don't
read
1341
the
way
you
do.
it
seems
to
me
that
little
(i)
at
the
top
of
your
page
2a
is
a
safe
harbor.
i
don't
think
that
the,
even
if
it
is
a
fiduciary
decision
that
he
has
to,
once
he
has
found
an
insurer
that
is
rock
solid,
that
is
willing
to
provide
all
the
benefit
liabilities,
i
don't
think
he
has
to
look
throughout
the
rest
of
the
world
to
see
if
there
is
anything
that
might
be
better
for
his
plan
participants.
i
think
that's
a
safe
harbor
and
if
he
purchases
an
irrevocable
commitment
from
an
insurer
and
then
that
insurer
is
as
solvent
as
any
other
insurer
he
is
home
free.
you're
saying
he
is
not
home
free.
he
has
to
consider
little
(ii)
and
see
what
other
ways
of
fully
providing
all
benefit
liabilities
might
be
better
for
the
plan
participants.
i...
i
think
that's,
that's
placing
on
him
an
obligation
that
i
don't
see
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
reversion
to
the
employees
who
have
made
contributions.
they
get
their
cash
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
of
these
is
beck
v.
pace
international
union,
number
05-1448.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it’s
a
case
about
pension
benefits
and
it
involves
the
federal
statute
known
as
erisa
which
is
the
acronym
for
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974.
the
respondent
pace
international
union
represented
employees
covered
by
pension
plans
sponsored
and
administrated
by
crown,
a
paper
company
which
had
filed
for
bankruptcy.
crown
had
over-funded
these
pension
plans
to
the
tune
of
$5
million.
as
crown
was
winding
down
its
affairs,
pace
proposed
that
crown
merge
its
pension
plans
into
pace’s
own
multiemployer
plan.
crown
rejected
this
proposal,
opting
instead
for
a
standard
plan
termination
through
the
purchase
of
annuities
which
allowed
it
retain
the
$5
million
surplus
for
its
creditors
rather
than
hand
the
$5
million
over
to
pace’s
multiemployer
plan.
pace
and
two
plan
participants
filed
an
adversary
action
in
the
bankruptcy
court
alleging
that
crown’s
directors
had
breached
their
fiduciary
duties
under
erisa
by
neglecting
to
give
diligent
consideration
to
pace’s
merger
proposal.
the
bankruptcy
court
ruled
for
pace
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction
that
prevented
crown
from
obtaining
the
$5
million
reversion.
petitioner,
the
trusty
of
the
crown
bankruptcy
estate
then
appealed
to
the
district
court
which
affirmed
in
relevant
part
as
did
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
implementation
of
a
decision
to
terminate
is
fiduciary
in
nature
and
that
merger
was
a
permissible
means
of
plan
termination.
crown
does
had
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
consider
pace’s
merger
proposal
seriously
which
it
had
failed
to
do.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
crown
did
not
breach
his
fiduciary
obligations
in
failing
to
consider
pace’s
merger
proposal
because
merger
is
not
a
permissible
form
plan
termination
under
erisa.
section
§1341(b)
(3)(a)
provides,
“in
any
final
distribution
of
assets
pursuant
to
standard
termination
the
plan
administrator
shall,
clause
one,
purchase
irrevocable
commitments
from
an
insurer
to
provide
all
benefit
liabilities
under
the
plan
or
clause
two,
otherwise
fully
provide
all
benefit
liabilities
under
the
plan.
the
parties
agreed
that
clause
one
referrers
to
the
purchase
of
annuities
which
is
the
course
that
crown
pursued
and
the
clause
two
allows
for
lump
sum
distributions.
well,
these
are
by
far
the
most
common
distribution
methods.
pace
maintains
that
merger
should
be
included
under
clause
two
because
it
argues,
“merger
is
the
legal
equivalent
of
purchasing
annuities.”
pace
faces
an
upfield
battle
however
because
accepting
its
argument
would
require
us
to
disagree
with
the
pension
benefit
guarantee
corporation,
the
entity
administering
the
federal
insurance
program
that
protects
plan
benefits.
the
pbgc
takes
the
position
that
erisa
does
not
permit
merger
as
a
method
of
termination
because
in
its
view
merger
is
an
alternative
to
rather
than
an
example
of
plan
termination.
this
court
has
traditionally
deferred
to
the
pbgc
when
interpreting
erisa
and
here
we
conclude
that
pbgc’s
policy
is
based
upon
a
contraction
of
the
statute
that
is
not
only
permissible
but
indeed
the
more
plausible.
three
points
strike
us
as
especially
persuasive.
first,
terminating
a
plan
through
purchase
of
annuities
formally
severs
erisa’s
applicability
to
plan
assets
and
employer
obligations.
whereas,
merging
the
crown’s
plans
into
pace’s
multiemployer
plan
would
result
in
the
former
plans
asset
remaining
within
erisa
where
they
could
be
used
to
satisfy
the
benefit
liabilities
of
the
multiemployer
plans
other
participants
and
beneficiaries.
second,
merger
would
preclude
the
employer
from
obtaining
a
reversion
of
surplus
funds
which
erisa
specifically
authorizes
upon
termination
and
third
the
structure
of
erisa,
amply
if
not
conclusively,
supports
the
conclusion
that
merger
is
not
a
permissible
formal
plan
termination.
merger
is
dealt
within
an
entirely
different
set
of
statutory
sections
setting
forth
entirely
different
rules
and
procedures.
pace’s
argument
that
the
procedural
differences
could
be
reconciled
by
requiring
an
employer
intending
to
use
merger
as
a
termination
method
to
follow
the
rules
for
both
merger
and
termination
is
condemned
by
the
confusion
it
would
engender
and
by
the
fact
that
it
has
no
apparent
basis
in
the
statute.
even
from
a
policy
standpoint
the
pbgc’s
construction
is
eminently
reasonable
because
termination
via
merger
could
have
detrimental
consequences
for
the
plan
participants
and
beneficiaries
of
a
single
employer
plan
as
well
as
for
plan
sponsors.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
cases
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
