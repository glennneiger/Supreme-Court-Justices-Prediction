ms.
julia
p.
clark
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
notable
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
government
in
their
arguments
here
has
referred
at
all
to
the
definition
of
fiduciary
in
erisa.
but
that
is
the
beginning
point
of
every
one
of
this
court's
decisions
as
to
what
is
a
fiduciary
function
and
what
is
not.
the
statute
and
i'm
quoting
from
29
u.s.c.,
section
1002(21)(a),
it's
in
the
first
page
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
is
that
a
person
is
a
fiduciary
with
respect
to
a
plan
to
the
extent
that...
and
then
it
goes
on
and
there
are
three
subparts,
two
of
which
are
relevant
in
this
case.
one
of
them
and
i'm
taking
them
out
of
order
because
i
think
subpart
3
is
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
this
case,
"to
the
extent
that
he
has
any
discretionary
authority
or
discretionary
responsibility
in
the
administration
of
the
plan.
"
the
other
one
that's
relevant
is
subpart
1,
which
is
"to
the
extent
he
has"...
"he
exercises
any
authority
or
control
respecting
disposition
of
its
assets.
"
the
reason
that
the
plan
administration
subpart
is
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
that
congress
in
section
1341
of
29
u.s.
code,
and
that's
quoted
just
immediately
below
what
i
was
just
citing
to
the
court,
specifically
assigned
to
the
plan
administrator
all
of
the
decisions
that
must
be
made
with
respect
to
implementing
the
termination
of
a
pension
plan.
throughout
that
section,
everything
that
must
be
done
is
stated
specifically
to
be
done
by
the
plan
administrator.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
justice
scalia,
that
of
course
is
the
second
major
issue
in
the
case,
and
the
government's
attorney
admitted
that
in
a
two-stage
transaction,
the
assets
and
liabilities
of
a
plan
can
be
transferred
to
another
plan,
and
the
plan
can
be
terminated
and
assuming
the
plan
provisions
are
correctly
in
place
the
employer
can
take
the
reversion
of
any
excess
assets.
and
then--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--justice
scalia,
the
implementation
guidelines
which
the
government
attorney
also
referred
to
have
as
their
entire
focus
to
make
certain
that
two-part
transactions
of
just
the
sort
that
you
have
referred
to
are
treated
as
a
single
whole
in
determining
whether
a
plan
has
been
legitimately
terminated
or
not.
the
entire
focus
of
those
guidelines
is,
we
are
not
going
to
permit
an
employer
by
separating
things
out
into
two
parts,
first
the
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities,
then
a
termination,
to
do
in
form
what
in
substance
is
simply
the
continuation
of
the
same
plan.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
i
agree
completely--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--i
agree
completely,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
the
decision
to
terminate
a
plan
is
the
plan's
sponsor
decision.
but
when
the
plan
sponsor
has
made
that
decision
and
the
question
on
the
table
is
how
shall
we
implement
that
decision
to
terminate,
it
does
not
matter
whether
that's
done
through
a
two-step
transaction
in
which
assets
are
first
transferred
to
another
plan
and
then
the
formal
termination
of
what's
left
remains.
the
implementation
guidelines
make
very
clear
that
you
can't
tease
those
apart
and
say
no,
we
are
only
going
to
look
at
the
final
step
and
that's
a
termination
and
nothing
else
is.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
no,
justice
scalia.
the
implementation
guidelines
did
not
address
the
question
of
in
what
capacity
these
decisions
would
be
made.
my
point
in
referring
to
it
is
simply
to
say
that
it
is,
it
is
a
form
over
substance
argument
to
say
that
there
is
a
difference
between
decision
to
terminate
in
which
the
plan
administrator
then
has
a
choice
of
implementing
it
by
either
transferring
the
assets
and
liabilities
to
another
plan
or
purchasing
an
annuity,
versus
as
the
government
and
as
the,
i
mean
as
the
petitioner
would
have
it,
that
that's
a
completely
different
transaction
from
merger
as
a
means
of
implementing--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--that
the
termination
decision
has
been
made.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
i'm
sorry;
i
didn't--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--that
is
what
my
adversary
says.
and
if
i
might
focus
on
the
termination
section
itself,
29
u.s.c.
section
1341,
their
position
has
been
that
a
merger
with
another
plan
is
completely
different
from
the
purchase
of
annuities
to
provide
those
benefits.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
the
government's
regulations
on
single
employer
plan
mergers
take
the
very
clear
position,
and
we
cited
them
in
our
brief,
it's
the
regulations
under
section
414(1),
the
clear
position
that
any
time
there
is
a
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities
from
one
plan
to
another,
whether
a
complete
transfer
or
not,
that
is
treated
as
a
spinoff
of
a
plan
from
the
original
plan
and
a
merger
of
the
spun
off
assets
and
liabilities
into
the
other
plan.
so
that
merger
is
a
more
flexible
concept.
it
is
not
just
the
all-in
kind
of
merger
where
two
plans
merge
and
continue
down
the
road
as
a
single
entity.
merger
also
in
the
government's
own
usage
describes
a
transaction
in
which
all
or
some
portion
of
liabilities
and
all
or
some
portion
of
assets
are
separated
from
the
original
plan
and
transferred
to
the
second
plan.
now,
that
being
the
case,
the
question
really
as
to
whether
this
is
the
proposed,
the
proposal
of
any
merger...
and
the
question
presented
to
the
court
is
in
the
abstract,
is
any
plan
merger
an
acceptable
means
of
terminating
a
plan
under
section
1341?
ms.
julia
p.
clark
yes,
justice
scalia.
that's
what
it
says.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
justice
scalia,
we
disagree
for
the
following
reason.
section
1341
specifically
provides
that
the
plan
administrator
implementing
a
plan
termination
may...
and
here
i'm
referring
to
the
language
that's
again
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief;
this
is
the
last
page
of
that
appendix,
right
at
the
top...
plan
administrator
may
purchase
irrevocable
commitments
from
an
insurer,
that's
an
insured
annuity,
to
provide
all
benefit
liabilities
under
the
plan,
or,
in
accordance
with
provisions
of
the
plan
and
any
applicable
regulations,
otherwise
fully
provide
all
benefit
liabilities
under
the
plan.
now,
this
court
just
last
week
in
james
vs.
united
states
construed
a
similar
statute
that
had
a
list
of
crimes
followed
by
the
phrase
or
otherwise
involves
a
serious
risk
of
potential
harm
to
persons...
i'm
paraphrasing.
i
didn't
get
it
exactly
right.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
agreed
that
an
"otherwise"
structure
of
this
sort
means
that
what
precedes
the
"otherwise"
phrase
is
taken
as
a
baseline
against
which
to
judge
what
follows
it,
and
that
it
tells
you
what
congress
had
in
mind
as
something
that
satisfies
in
this
case
the
distribution
requirements
of
the
statute.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
well,
justice
scalia,
it
does
it
in
exactly
the
same
way
the
purchase
of
an
insurance
policy
to
provide
annuities
from
an
insurer
does.
in
each
case
the
assets
are
commingled
with
the
entire
assets
of
the
financial
institution
to
which
these
liabilities
are
transferred.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
very
clear
that
if
as
we
are
correct...
i
mean,
as
we
argue
here,
if
we're
correct
that
it
is
a
fiduciary
responsibility
for
the
plan
administrator
to
select
the
option
on
the
table
that
is
most
secure
for
providing
the
benefits
in
the
future
to
the
participants,
that
if
the
multiemployer
plan
in
question
were
poorly
funded
or
shaky
for
any
other
reason
and
there
is
a
solid
insurance
company
offering
an
annuity,
that
the
plan
administrator
would--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--the
plan
administrator
is
the
one
that
ultimately
makes
the
determination.
the
union
may
advocate
for
what
it
believes
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
its
members,
but
the
party
that
makes
the
decision
is
the
plan
administrator
wearing
a
fiduciary
hat
under
which
it
can
make
no
decisions--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--probably
the
single
advantage
to
participants
in
a
multiemployer
plan
is
portability,
which
is
to
say
some
of
these
participants
were
working
for
employers
that
purchased
facilities
from
crown
and
if
their
employer
participated
in
the
multiemployer
plan
in
the
future
they
would
be
able
to
add
to
the
benefits
that
they
had
accrued
and
perhaps
to
reach
something
like
an
enhanced
benefit
at
25
years
of
service
or
the
like.
in
terms
of
advantage
to
the
participant
in
comparison
to
an
annuity,
that
would
be
the
major
one.
but
i
want
to
come
back
to
why
it
is
that
the
multiemployer
plan
distributes
the
assets
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
the
purchase
of
an
annuity
from
an
insurance
company
does.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
yes,
it
does,
justice
scalia.
the
law
requires
that.
in
any
plan
merger
or
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities
from
one
plan
to
the
other,
the
fundamental
requirement
is
that
all
benefits
earned
to
the
date
of
the
transfer
must
be
protected
on
both
sides
of
the
transaction
for
all
participants.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
pbgc.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
they
do
not.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
no.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
no.
the
department
of
labor
has
made
clear
that
when
making
a
fiduciary
choice
among
annuities
that
are
offered
by
an
insurer,
it
is
the
plan
administrator's
fiduciary
duty
to
look
to
the
security
of
the
benefit.
that
is
its
sole
guiding
concern.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
that
would
depend
on
the
plan,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
plan--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--no,
we
disagree.
the
district
court
determined
that
they
did
authorize
the
merger
for
this
purpose.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
justice
scalia,
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
that
held
that
the
argument
was
waived.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
this
was
not
presented
in
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
argument
would
not
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
petitioner's
urging
the
court
of
appeals
to
overturn
what
the
district
court
had
done.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
in
this
case,
i
could
see
a
reason
why
that
would
make
sense,
because
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
both
parties
presented
evidence,
and
the
interpretation
of
a
plan
document
is
like
interpreting
any
other
contract.
you
may
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
on
what
it
means.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case,
because
the
funding
rules
of
erisa
do
encourage
employers
to
fund
well
at
times
when
times
are
good.
but--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--that
may
well
be
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
or
they
may
say
whatever
the
method
of
implementing
the
termination
that
the
plan
administrator
chooses,
it
must
provide
for
a
reversion
to
the
employer.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
the
actual--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
could
answer
that
on
two
levels.
one
is
that
the
record
of
this
case
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
this
would
have
been
negotiated
to
leave
the
reversion
for
the
employer.
but
that's
speculation
because,
since
the
fiduciary
didn't
go
down
that
path,
we
don't
know
where
it
could
have
taken
it.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
it
never
goes
to
the
union.
that
would
be
violation
of
a
different
section
of
federal
law.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
but
to
a
plan.
the
reason...
and
plans
simply
don't
address
this,
except
for
authorize
merger--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--if
the
employer
had
said,
had
amended
the
plan
to
say,
whatever
you
do
by
way
of
terminating
this
plan,
you
must
protect
our
right
to
the
reversion,
then
the
plan
administrator
would
have
been--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--no,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
not,
because
there
there
really
is
an
impact
on
the
form
and
the
amount
of
benefits
that
will
be
accrued
in
the
future
under
an
ongoing
plan,
as
well
as--
ms.
julia
p.
clark
--no,
justice
kennedy.
it's
the
ongoing
significance
to
the
participants,
because
then
what
you
have
is
truly
a
plan
design
decision,
which
does
not
come
within
plan
administration,
while
in
the
case
of
a
merger
as
a
means
of
implementing
termination
the
law
fixes
those
benefits.
they
are
what
they
are.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
again,
it's
not,
it's
not
the
timing.
it's
the
context.
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
employer
is
clearly
going
out
of
business,
it's
talking
termination,
it's
got
annuity
quotes
on
the
table,
it's,
everything
is
the
implementation
of
the
termination
of
the
plan.
if
instead
this
employer
remains
in
business
and
is
continuing
to
employ
people
who
are
going
to
be
accruing
benefits
in
the
future,
then
that
is
the
question
of
what
are
the
benefits
they
are
going
to
be
accruing
in
the
future.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
that
would
be
a
plan
sponsor
decision,
but
the
plan
sponsor
would
be
subjecting
itself
to
obligations
for
future
enhanced
funding
of
the
plan
that
it
joins.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
justice
breyer,
i
believe
i
was
cut
off
and
didn't
finish
my
answer
to
your
question
when
you
asked
it
before.
in
determining
which
of
two
annuities
on
the
table
are
to
be
chosen,
the
department
of
labor's
instructions
to
employers
have
clearly
said
if
they're
equal
on
the
basis
of
safety
and
security
of
the
benefits,
then
it's
appropriate
for
the
fiduciary
to
take
other
considerations
into
account.
so
our
position
here
would
be
that,
by
parallel
to
that,
if
the
fiduciary
were
to
conclude
that
the
multiemployer
plan
is
of
equal
safety
and
security
to
the
participants
benefits
that
they
have
earned
to
date,
it
would
then
be
able
to
take
into
consideration
in
the
interest
of
participants
any
other
difference.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
only
if
the
two
companies
are
equivalent
in
terms
of
their
security.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
i'm
trying
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
question
fully,
justice
breyer.
the,
the
choice
must
be
made
and
the
department
of
labor's
instructions
to
employers
are
very
clear
on
this,
in
the
interest
of
the
security
of
those
benefits
which
have
been
accrued,
that's
the
guiding
principle,
(i)
single
to
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
beneficiaries.
if
they
are
equal,
then
the
department
of
labor
guidelines
permit
the
fiduciary
to
take
other
factors
into
consideration.
so
that
the
first
decision
has
to
be
made
in
terms
of
the
security
of
those
benefits
that
the
individual
has
already
earned.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
well,
justice
scalia,
a
safe
harbor
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
isn't
appropriate
for
the
fiduciary
to
consider
other
alternatives.
it
would
mean
i
believe
if
he
chooses
an
annuity
that
is
a
safe
and
secure
way
to
provide
the
benefit
and
is
equally
good
with
anything
else,
he
would
be
solidly
protected
from
any
challenge
that
a
participant
might
make.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
if...
if
options
have
been
proposed
and
they
are
of
equal
or
better
security
for
the
participants,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
yes,
justice
souter.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
that
was
what
the
district
court
found,
that
the
provisions
of
the
plan
authorized
the
merger,
as
an
option.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
the
district
court
cited
what
it
was
relying
on;
i
don't
have
those
at
my
fingertips.
ms.
julia
p.
clark
well...
the
usual
reading
of
a
term
in
accordance
with
means
that
it
must
not
violate.
it
must
be
consistent
with
the
terms
of
that
plan.

certainly
if
the
plan
has
a
provision
then
it
must
be
followed.
if
the
plan
is
silent,
mr.
chief
justice,
your...
your
question
suggests
that
there
must
be
an
affirmative
authorization
in
the
plan.
the
district
court
found
there
was
sufficient
authorization
here
in
whatever
form
that
the
district
court
found
satisfactory.
and
because
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
a
bankruptcy
court
there
was
no
opportunity
to
present
evidence
on
that
matter.

precisely,
justice
ginsburg.
now,
i
have...
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
