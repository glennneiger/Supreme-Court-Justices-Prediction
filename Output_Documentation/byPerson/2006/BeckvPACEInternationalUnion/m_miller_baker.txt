mr.
m.
miller
baker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
filing
for
bankruptcy,
crown
vantage
decided
to
terminate
12
over-funded
pension
plans.
by
terminating
these
pension
plans,
crown
was
able
to
provide
its
plan
participants
with
100
percent
of
their
accrued
benefits
and
at
the
same
time
recover
almost
$5
million
in
surplus
plan
assets
for
the
benefits
of
both
crown's
creditors
as
well
as
plan
members
who
made
individual
contributions
to
those
pension
plans.
after
crown
made
the
decision
to
terminate
these
pension
plans,
it
received
a
merger
proposal
from
the
pace
union
to
merge
the
pension
plan
into
the
pace
multi-employer
pension
plan.
crown
rejected
that
proposal.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
crown
breached
its
fiduciary
duty
by
not
sufficiently
considering
that
merger
proposal.
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
for
two
separate
and
independent
reasons.
first,
merger
is
a
nonfiduciary
plan
sponsor
function
and
crown
could
not
have
had
a
fiduciary
duty
to
consider
the
merger
proposal
by
pace.
a
series
of
this
court's
decisions
beginning
with
curtiss-wright
and
continuing
with
lockheed,
hughes
aircraft
and
pegram
hold
that
decisions
to
create,
to
modify,
to
terminate,
or
to
amend
pension
plans
are
sponsor
functions,
settlor
functions
under
trust
law,
that
are
not
subject
to
erisa
fiduciary
duties.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
justice...
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
correct.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
a
decision
to
terminate
a
plan
or
a
decision
to
merge
a
plan
requires
that
a
plan
sponsor
consider
as
a
threshold
matter
several
factors.
first,
what
will
the
plan
form
be
of
the
acquiring
plan?
and
pace's
proposal
would
have
required
the
merger
into
a
multiemployer
plan
as
opposed
to
a
single
employer
plan.
that
goes
to
the
form
of
the
plan.
pace's
proposal
would
have
resulted
in
a
new
plan
sponsor
and
a
new
plan
administrator.
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
new
dispute
resolution
mechanism.
that
goes
to
the
content
of
the
plan.
and
finally,
most
importantly,
the
pace
proposal
would
have
gone
to
the
level
of
benefits
provided
by
the
plan
and
the
level
of
benefits,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
is
a
decision
that
is
a
plan
sponsor
decision.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
justice
kennedy,
it
depends
upon
the
function
at
issue.
if
the
function
is
the
selection
of
an
insurance
company
to
provide
the
annuity,
that
is
a
plan
administrator
function
and
it
is
subject
to
erisa
fiduciary
duties.
but
you
is
to
analyze
it
from--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--it
absolutely
is,
justice
kennedy,
kennedy.
but
it
is
only
in
the
context
of
the
selection
of
the
annuity
that
the
plan
sponsor,
the
plan
administrator,
must
purchase
after
the
plan
sponsor
has
made
that
threshold
decision
to
terminate
the
plan.
there
is
that
threshold
decision.
and
likewise,
merger
is
a
threshold
decision
that
goes
to
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--there
are
two
decisions
in
a
merger
case
and
the
threshold
question,
justice
souter,
is
whether
to
merge.
whether
to
merge
is
a--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's
a
different
question,
justice
souter.
the
question
is
whether
to
merge,
and
a
question
whether
to
merge
goes
to
plan
form,
it
goes
to
the
content
of
the
plan
and
it
also--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--justice
souter,
there
are
two
different
questions.
one
question
is
termination,
one
question
is
merger,
and
they're
not
the
same.
and
the
question
whether
to
merge
is
a
sponsor
decision
because
you
have
to
make
those
threshold
questions
as
to
what
will
the
form
of
the
plan
be,
what
will
the
benefits
provided
be.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
it's
not
a
disposition
of
assets,
justice
souter.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
it
is...
once
a
plan
decision,
once
a
termination
decision
has
been
made,
and
once
that
decision
has
been
executed,
it's
impossible
to
merge
the
plan.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
absolutely,
it's
not
a
termination.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
it
is
a
business
decision
to
decide
in
what
form
the
benefits
are
going
to
be
provided.
and
the
very
choice
between
a
termination
and
a
merger
goes
to
that
issue.
for
example,
in
a
merger,
there
is
no
automatic
vesting--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--because
at
that
point,
it's
a
mere
execution
of
the
prior
policy
decision.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
because
the
merger
decision...
you
have
to
ask
those
threshold
questions,
justice
kennedy,
what
are
the
level
of
benefits
that
are
going
to
be
provided
in
the
acquiring
plan.
in
a
merger,
there
is
no
automatic
vesting
of
accrued
benefits
as
there
is
in
a
termination.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
none
of
us
do,
justice
scalia.
the
answer
to
the
third
part
of
that
question,
justice
breyer,
is
yes.
but
where
i
disagree
with
you
is
in
the
second
predicate,
which
is
that
the...
the
execution
of
the
termination
is
necessarily--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--perhaps
i
was
imprecise.
if
i
was
imprecise,
i
apologize.
the
answer
is,
it
depends
upon
the
function
at
issue.
a
broad
generalization
that
any
decision
taken
after
termination
is
necessarily
a
plan
sponsor
function
is
just
wrong.
one
has
to
look
at
the
function
at
issue,
and
the
function
in
connection
with
a
merger
is
a
plan
sponsor
decision,
because
you
can't
get
away
from
those
threshold
questions
as
to
the
form,
the
content,
and
the
benefits
that
are
to
be
provided
in
that
plan.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
because
the
decision
has
already
been
made,
usually
it's
in
the
plan
document,
to
provide
for
annuities.
and
the
only
question
is
providing
the
annuity
that
is
best
suited
to
the
interest
of
the
principals.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
you
mean
the
decision
to
offer
annuities?
yes,
justice
souter.
the
decision
to
offer
annuities,
that
is
the
provision,
the
actual
selection
of
the
annuities...
and
i
note
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
require--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
justice...
the...
if
the
plan
is
silent--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--if
the
plan
is
silent,
and
the
plan
sponsor...
and
the
question
is,
how
do
we
distribute,
the
mechanism
of
distribution.
that
is
a
plan
sponsor
function
in
the
absence
of
any
provision--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
that
would
not
be
permitted
by
the,
by
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--by
operation
of
law,
justice
souter.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
that
is
a
second
argument,
an
alternative
argument,
chief
justice
roberts,
that
merger
is
not
a
means
of
termination.
but
the
threshold
question
is--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--justice
scalia,
they
may
have
different
issues
associated
with
them.
but
the
threshold
question
here
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
plan
sponsor
decision.
and
a
plan
sponsor
decision
is
always
a
decision
that
goes
to
the
content
and
the
form
of
the
plan,
as
well
as
to
level
of
benefits
to
be
provided.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
what's
really
in
dispute,
justice
alito.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
it's
not
a
fiduciary
duty.
this
court's
cases
are...
the
pbgc
and
the
agencies
recognize
that
the
decision
to
terminate
in
order
to
recapture
a
reversion
is
perfectly
permissible,
so
long
as
the
plan
sponsor
complies
with
all
the
relevant
requirements
of
a
termination.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
if
we
lose
on
both
the
issues
that
we
have
argued,
justice--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
money
here
would
have
gone
not
to
the
plan
members,
but
to
another
union.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
if
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation,
no.
if
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation,
the
plan
sponsor,
plan
administrator...
because
now
we're
talking
about
an
administrative
function...
the
plan
administrator
has
a
duty
to
carefully
consider
that
option.
it
doesn't
necessarily
result
in
the
money
automatically
flowing
over--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no.
the
plan
administrator,
acting
as
a
fiduciary,
can
only
consider
the
interest
of
the
employees.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
going
to
turn...
cover
a
couple
points
on
function
and
then
turn
to
the
statutory
question.
first,
i
would
like
to
return
the
court
to
the
factual
context
of
this
case.
in
this
case,
pace
made
not
a
two-step
proposal,
pace
proposed
an
outright
merger
in
which
all
assets
and
liabilities
would
be
transferred
to
the
pace
union.
that's
in
the
record.
it's
plaintiff's
trial
exhibit
25.
and
what's
significant
about
the
merger
proposal
that
pace
sent
to
crown
is
that
this
is
pace's
merger
proposal.
it
had
crown
signing
the
merger
in
crown's
planned
sponsor
capacity
not
as
a,
not
as
an
administrator
but
as
a
plan
sponsor.
that's
what
pace
proposed,
recognizing
that
the
decision
whether
to
merge
the
plan
was
a
plan
sponsor
function.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the,
also
the
second
stage
issue
here.
even,
even
if
this
was
a
two-stage
transaction,
which
was
not
proposed,
each
stage
of
that
transaction
is
a
plan
sponsor
decision.
a
plan
sponsor
has
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
transfer
assets
and
then
a
plan
sponsor
has
to
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
then
terminate
the
plan.
each
separate
stage
is
a
plan
sponsor
function.
in
terms
of
the
plan
sponsor
function
changing
because
the
company
is
going
out
of
business,
that
simply
cannot
be.
a
plan
sponsor
function
depends
upon
what
the
function
is,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
business
is
going
out
of
business
or
whether
the
business
is
an
ongoing
concern.
if
anything,
because
it's
going
out
of
business,
it's
important
to
protect
the,
the
discretion
of
a
plan
sponsor.
in
terms
of
the
contextual
argument
it's
very
important
to
note
that
nowhere...
that
section
1341
which
governs
standard
termination
does
not
cross-reference
mergers
and
the
section
1412
governing
mergers
does
not
apply
to
terminations.
in
fact
the
only
place
in
the
statute
where
the
two
words
appear
together
is
in
section
1058,
in
which
the
two
procedures
are
actually
compared
to
each
other.
there
are
some
significant
differences
between
termination
and
merger.
in
a
termination,
there
is
a
reversion
to
the
company.
there
is
also
reversion
to
employees
based
upon
their
individual
contributions.
there
is
no
similar
reversion
in
a
merger.
that
is
why
a
merger
simply
cannot
be
a
method
of
termination.
the
two
are
different.
you
might
have
a
two-stage
transaction
but
they
are
two
separate
transactions
each
of
which
is
a
plan
sponsor
function.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
yes.
if
employees,
under
1334,
if
employees
have
made
individual
contributions
to
the
plan,
it's
not
merely
paid
for
by
the
employer--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
employee
has
a
right
to
a
pro
rata
percentage
of
the
surplus
plan
assets
in
the
event
of
termination.
there
is
no
similar
right
of
reversion
to
the
employee
in
the
event
of
a
merger.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i'm
not
sure
i...
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
a
plan
cannot
provide
for
that
because
it
would
be
contrary
to
erisa,
justice
souter.
