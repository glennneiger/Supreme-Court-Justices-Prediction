i'm
puzzled.
can
i
just
get
myself
straightened
out
a
little
bit?
if
there
is
a
decision
to
terminate
you're
suggesting,
you're
suggesting
that
it's
after
that
decision
made,
is
made,
there
can
be
a
decision
to
merge
which
would
not
be
a
termination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your,
your
adversary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
disagree
with
you
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
adversary
takes
a
position
that
the
merger
would
be
not
a
termination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
merger
is
a
continuation
rather
than
a
termination.
and
explain
to
me
why
i'm
wrong
on
that.
