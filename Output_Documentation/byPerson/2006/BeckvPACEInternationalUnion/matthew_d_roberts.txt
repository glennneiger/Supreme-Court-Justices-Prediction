mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
employer
does
not
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
consider
merger
as
a
means
of
terminating
a
defined
benefit
pension
plan.
first
of
all,
just
like
the
decision
to
terminate
the
plan,
the
decision
to
merge
the
plan
is
a
sponsor
function,
because
it's
a
choice
to
alter
the
design,
composition
and
structure
of
the
plan.
and
because
both
the
decision
to
terminate
and
the
decision
to
merge
are
sponsor
functions,
the
choice
between
the
two
is
a
sponsor
function.
the
plan
administrator
has
a
duty
to
carry
out
the
sponsor's
decision
to
terminate
the
plan,
not
to
revisit
that
decision
by
considering
whether
to
merge
the
plan
instead.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
that
would
be
not
be
a
distribution
of
the
assets
as
a
means
of
terminating
the
plan,
but
the
employer
as
a
sponsor
could,
of
course,
decide
to
merge
the
plan
instead
of
to
terminate
the
plan,
if
the
employer
made
that
choice.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
there
are
two
reasons
that
i
say
that.
first,
even
in
the
case
of
a
sponsor
of
a
plan
that's
going
out
of
business,
and
that
isn't
going
to
be
participating
in
any
merged
plan,
the
merger
still
is
a
decision
to
alter
the
design
and
composition
and
structure
of
the
plan,
as
this
case
illustrates
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
baker
said.
that
it's
going
to
change
fundamentally
the
plan
from
a
single
employer
plan
to
a
multi-employer
plan,
that
it's
going
to
change
the...
who
is
the
administrator,
that
it's
going
to
increase
the
pool
of
participants,
that
it's
going
to
affect
the
benefits,
because
the
assets
that
were
available
to
pay
the
benefits
are
now
going
to
be
available
to
pay
benefits
of
other
participants
in
the,
in
the
successor
plan,
that
the
pbgc's
guarantee
of
the
benefits
is
going
to
be
lower
in
a
multi-employer
plan.
so
for
all
those
reasons,
it's
going
to
change,
still
change
the
structure
of
the
plan.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
employer
of...
the
sponsor
of
this
plan
that
would
either
terminate,
or
possibly
merge,
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
choosing
termination
rather
than
merger,
because
in
a
termination,
the
sponsor
can
obtain
a
reversion
of
the
surplus
assets,
and
still
fully
provide
all
the
benefits
of
the
employees.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
and
that
goes
back
to
a
confusion
that
i
think
was...
was
present
before,
that
the
decision
about
the
distribution
options
at
termination
is
a
sponsor
decision
that
the
employer
makes
in
the
plan
documents,
because
those
distribution
options
are
benefits
under
the
plan.
and
while
section
1341(b)(3)(a),
in
isolation,
might
appear
to
permit
the
plan
administrator
to
choose
which
of
those
distribution
options
that
are
in
the
plan
to
make
available,
other
provisions
of
erisa
and
the
tax
code
prohibit
the
plan
from
vesting
that
discretion
in
the
plan
administrator.
so
in
other
words,
the
way
it
works
is
when
the
employer
sets
up
the
plan,
the
employer
provides
for
the
forms
of
distribution
that
are
going
to
be
available
at
termination.
and
those
forms
are
just
forms
of
benefits,
optional
ways
of
providing
the
accrued
benefits
to
the
participants.
and
then
the
participants
get
to
pick
among
those
options
at
termination.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we
think
that
one
requirement
is
that
it's
consistent
with
the
plan,
and
the
plan
didn't
provide
that
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
held
it
was
waived.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
would
certainly
be
a
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
correctly
decided
this
case,
other
than
the
way
it
did.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
was
presented.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioner
had
waived
the
argument,
based
on
the
terms
of
the
plan,
because
petitioner
hadn't
made
that
argument
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
even
though
the
district
court
had
actually
addressed
the
terms
of
the
plan,
but
mistakenly
construed
the
plan
to
permit
merger,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
assume
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
district
court's
decision,
you
know,
there
is
no
decision
on
it.
and
if
it's
necessary
to...
to
resolving
the
questions
presented,
i
think
the
court
could
address
that
question.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
resolve
the
questions
presented
because
we
think
that
merger
is
a,
is
a
sponsor
decision
as
a
choice
to
alter
the
design,
composition
and
the
structure
of
the
plan
even
if
it
arises
in
the
context
of
termination.
and
in
addition,
we
also
think
that
merger
is
not
a
permissible
method
of
plan
termination
under
the
statute
or
pbgc
regulations
which
treat
merger
and
termination
as
distinct
procedures.
the
statute
requires
that
the
assets
of
a
terminating
plan
be
distributed
by
allocating
them
among
the
participants
of
that
plan.
that
just
doesn't
occur
in
a
merger.
instead
the
assets
are
transferred
to
the
successor
plan
and
in
the
successor
plan
they
are
commingled
to
fund
the
benefits
of
all
the
participants
in
that
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
plan
document
could
provide
for
a
reversion
for
the
employer
and
in
fact
this...
it
does.
but
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that.
yes,
because
that
would
be
consistent
with
erisa
and
the
administrator
has
to
follow
the
plan
in
accordance
with
erisa.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
an
employer,
not
an
administrator
could,
could
as
a
sponsor
of
the
plan
decide
to
do
a
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities
of
some
portion
of
the,
of
the
plan
assets
and
retain
some
assets
in
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
the
employer
would
have
to
do
would
be
make
a
sponsor
decision
to
make
a
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities
to
the
pace
plan
before
terminating
the
plan.
the
employer
could
make
that
decision
but
that,
that
decision
and
the
decision
afterwards
to
terminate
the
remains
of
the
plan
would
both
be
sponsor
decisions
that
the
employer
wouldn't
make
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it...
it
could
conceivably
do
that,
your
honor,
subject
to
the
fact
that
there
are
guidelines
that
the
agencies
have
put
out,
the
1984
joint
guidelines
that
require
in
some
cases,
in
order
to
prevent
circumvention
of
the
termination
requirements,
that
require
the
purchase
of
annuities
or
the
other
distribution
of
the
assets,
that
those
guidelines
require
that
if
there
is
a
spinoff
or
a
transfer
of
assets
that's
followed
by
the,
by
the
termination
of
the
remains
of
the
transferee
plan,
that
in
some
circumstances
annuities
have
to
be
purchased
for
the
accrued
benefits
of
the
participants
that
are
transferred
into
the
other
ongoing
plan
and
that
are
going
to
be
participants
of
that
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor
but
that
would
be
a
decision
that
they
make
as
sponsor
of
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
subject
to
the
fact
that
here
it's
quite
possible
that
the
pbgc
would
consider
a
transfer
of
assets
and
liabilities
just
to
leave
assets
in
a
plan
as
a
reversion,
that
they
would
be
subject
to
that
requirement.
and
so
they
would
have
to
annuitize
the
benefits
of,
of
the
participants
in
the
plan.
because
the
pbgc
would...
would
look
at
that
and
they
would
say
that
looks
like
an
effort
just
to
extract
assets
out
of
what's
really
an
ongoing
plan
because
the
employer
is
not
going
to
be
participating
in
that
other
plan.
the...
they
are
just
stripping
it.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
i
could
answer
the--
question.
the...
the...
they
could
not...
the
plan
administrator
could
decide
to
give
the
reversion
to
the
employees
and
not...
not
take
a
reversion.
it
could
amend
the
plan
to
allow
that
but
the
point
is
it
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
taking
the
reversion
and
that
that
interest
encourages
plan
sponsors
to
fully
fund
their
plan,
and
depriving
it
of
that
would
prevent
them
from
that
discourage
full
funding
of
plans.
