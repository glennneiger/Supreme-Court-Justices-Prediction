we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
05-1448,
beck
versus
pace
international
union.
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought
your
argument
was,
once
you
make
a
decision
to
terminate,
there
are
various
rules
that
are
triggered,
you
just
can't
take
the
money
and
run
with
it.
you've
got
to
make
provision.
and
that
merger
was
not
one
of
the
permitted
ways
of
terminating
a
plan.
is
that
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
point
is
the
$5
million
is
not
going
to
these
employees,
it's
being
thrown
into
this
vast
sea
of
all
these
other
employees,
whose
employers
have
not
done
as
good
a
job
of
funding
their
plans.
this
is
to
the
benefit
not
to
the
beneficiaries
of
this
plan,
but
to
other
union
members
who
don't
have
the
luxury
of
having
an
employer
who
has
overfunded
their
plan,
and
are
trying
to
get
that
five
million
to
help
them,
not
your
beneficiaries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
clark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
we
just
heard
that
the
pbgc
might
look
at
it
a
little
differently,
that
they
are
more
comfortable
with
the
annuity
insuring
that
these
beneficiaries
get
their
benefits
as
opposed
to
just
throwing
the
beneficiaries
into
a
pool
with
your
other
union
members.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
this
put
you
in
an
awfully
difficult
position?
i
mean,
you're
representing
the
union,
which
has
other
members
besides
these
beneficiaries,
and
you're
saying
even
though
under
their
plan
the
beneficiaries
are
fully
protected
with
irrevocable
annuities,
we
think
they're
going
to
be
better
off
if
they're
thrown
in
with
our
other
members
and
we
get
the
$5
million
to
spread
out,
not
to
these
beneficiaries
but
among
all
these
other
members.
isn't
that
an
awkward
position
to
be
in?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
beyond
as
well?
i
mean,
let's
say
we
have
5
million
extra
dollars
here.
see,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
if
you're
saying
it's
a
fiduciary,
i
mean,
how
can
they
make
a
decision
ever
to
do
anything
other
than
just
give
the
five
million
to
the
beneficiaries?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
terms,
the
plans
terms
here,
did
not
provide
for
merger
in
the
event
of
termination,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
district
court
decided
it?
usually
in
a
waiver
situation
it's
whether
you
argued
it
or
whether
it
was
addressed
by
the
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you're...
if
you
prevail
here...
i
mean,
the
reason
we
have
a
case
is
because
the
employer
overfunded
the
plan
to
the
tune
of
$5
million.
if
you
prevail
and
they
cannot
get
that
back
even
after
fully
insuring
the
benefits
for
the
beneficiaries,
employers
in
the
future
will
be
very
careful
not
to
put
in
one
penny
more
than
what's
required
to
fund
the
plan;
isn't
that
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
possible
equitable
basis
does
the
union
have
to
claim
this
extra
$5
million?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
for
these
beneficiaries.
it's
for
all
the
others.
it's
spread
out
among
this
pool
in
the
multiemployer
plan.
these
are
the
employer
excess
contributions.
what...
looking
at
it
as
an
equitable
matter,
what
claim
do
they
have
to
the
extra
money?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
a
lot
of
plans
that
look
like
that,
that
if
there's
extra
money,
we've
overfunded
that
it
goes
back
to
the
union,
not
back
to
the
company?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
union
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
little--
(ii)
that
you're
relying
on
begins
by
saying
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
plan,
the
other
solution
otherwise
provides.
where
in
the
provisions
of
the
plan
does
it
say
that
they
will
consider
merger?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know,
is
there
a
particular
provision
in
the
plan
that
says
that?
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
read
in
accordance
with
the
way
you
do.
i
read
in
accordance
with
to
mean
provided
by
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
ms.
clark.
mr.
baker,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
