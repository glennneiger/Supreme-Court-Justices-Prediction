justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
i
think
our
sticking
point.
if
the,
if
the
plan
sponsor
decides
to
purchase
an
annuity,
it's
accepted
i
think
by
you
and
by
everybody
that
there
are
two
decisions
being
made.
decision
one
is
terminate
the
plan.
decision
two,
distribute
the
assets
by
purchasing
an
annuity
that
gives
the
beneficiaries
what
they
should
get.
and
so
on.
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
merger,
you're
saying
there's
only
one
decision,
and
i
think
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble
with
your
argument.
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
merger,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
decisions
again.
the
first
decision
is
we're
going
to
terminate
the
plan
that
we've
got.
what
do
we
do
with
our
assets.
we
have
decided
to
merge...
one
possible
decision
as
an
alternative
to
annuities
is
to
merge
the
plan
with,
with
another
one.
why
aren't
there
two
decisions
in
the
merger
case
just
as
there
are
two
decisions
in
the
annuity
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
say
that's
the
threshold
question?
i
thought
the
threshold
question
is
whether
to
terminate
what
we've
got
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
say,
look,
we're
not
ending
our
plan.
let's
assume
you
have
an
ongoing
business
and
they
say,
we're
just
sick
of
the
form
that
it's
in
now
and
we
can
get
a
good
deal
by
letting
somebody
else
administer
this,
so
we're
going
to
merge.
i
can
see
that
as
a
single
decision.
but
that's
not
what
you've
got
here.
as
i
understand
it,
the
decision
to
terminate
was
made,
it
was
over
and
done
with.
the
question
was
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
these
assets?
it's
at
that
point
that
pace
arrived
and
said:
give
them
to
us
through
a
merger.
i
don't
see
how
you
eliminate
the,
the
termination
decision
before
the
merger
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
form
of
the
plan
is
going
to
be
zero.
our
plan
is
over.
we
are
terminating
our
plan.
what
do
we
do
now?
we
have
two
choices
roughly,
maybe
three.
we
can
either
buy
annuities,
we
can
give
the
assets
to
the
beneficiaries
or
we
can
give
the
assets
to
pace
in
the
form
of
a
merger.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
you
can't
have
a
merger
of
a
plan
that
has
already
been
terminated,
so
that
the
merger
decision
is
necessarily
a
decision
that
has
to
be
made
before
the
termination...
before
a
termination
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
keep
suggesting.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
exactly
the
same
point
true
with
respect
to
purchasing
annuities?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
plan
document
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
will
follow
termination.
there
is
nothing
in
there
about
annuities.
is
the
annuity...
the
decision
to
purchase
annuities
a
decision
subject
to
fiduciary
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
decision
to...
to
take
the
option
of
purchasing
annuities
or
offering
annuities
to
the
beneficiaries,
that
is
a
fiduciary
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
plan
is
silent.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
they
say,
we
will
distribute
by
going
to
the
top
of
the
building
and
throwing
the
money
out
on
the
street.
fiduciary
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
reserve
your
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
are
we
having
this
argument?
why
isn't
it
simply
a
question
of
construing
the
provision
for
options
in
the
original
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
isn't
the
simple
argument,
you
can't
merge
because
the
plan
didn't
provide
that
as
an
option.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
position
presented,
i
should
have
asked
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
we've
got
to
assume
that
the
plan
is
silent
in
the
sense
that,
insofar
as
the
plan
documents
are
concerned,
merger
is
at
least
a
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
the
administrator
here
take
the
position
that
it's
going
to
reserve
the
five
million
for
itself
and
merge
what's
left?
if
pace
wants
a
merger
with
what's
left,
fine;
if
pace
doesn't,
end
of
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
is
why...
why
isn't
it
an
option
here
to
say
all
right,
number
one,
we
got
a
$5
million
surplus.
we
are
going
to
terminate
this
plan
and
we
are
going
to
take
the
five
million.
question
number
two,
should
we,
should
we
use
what's
left
to
merge
into
the
pace
plan?
is
that
an
option?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
doing
it
in
that
sequence
could
it
reserve
the
five
million
for
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
assume
that,
can
they
keep
the
five
million?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
care
how
they
make
it;
i
just
want
to
know
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
and
consistently
with
erisa,
could
they
keep
the
five
million
and
in
some
sequence
provide
for
a
merger
with
pace?
and
i
think
you're
telling
me
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
what
about
the
employees
who
are
on
board
at
the
time
the
merger
decision
is
made?
are
you
saying
that
an,
an
employer
who
continues
to
operate
can
say,
i'm
going
to
merge
my
sound
plan,
i'm
sick
of
having
to
worry
about
it,
i'm
going
to
merge
this
financially
sound
plan
into
plan
a
out
here,
which
is
very,
very
shaky,
and
i
know
perfectly
well
that
plan
a,
you
know,
may
very
well
collapse,
but
i
don't
care.
i
just
want
to
get
rid
of
what
i
have.
is
that
an
option
for
the
plan
sponsor?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
in
this
case,
this
is
sort
of
the
square
one
question
that
i
want
to
be
clear
on.
you're
saying
in
this
case
simply
that
the
employer
had
to
give
consideration
to
pace's
proposal
rather
than
cutting
off
consideration,
we
presume
in
part,
because
of
the
issue
of
the
$5
million.
it
had
to
think
about
it
some
more.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
plan,
the
plan
provides
that
in
the
event
of
a
merger
there
will
in
fact
be
a
reversion
to
the
employees,
if
they've
paid
in
too
much
or
to,
or
to
the
sponsor
if
the
sponsor
has
overfunded,
and
there
will
be
no
merger
except
on
those
terms?
is
that
enforceable?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
plan
document
says
look,
if
we
decide
to
merge,
anybody
who
has
paid
in
more
than
he
has
to,
employee
or
employer,
gets
the
money
back
or
there's
no
merger.
in
other
words
it's
going
to
be
the
terms
of
the
merger
that
there
is
a
reversion.
can
a
plan
provide
for
that?
