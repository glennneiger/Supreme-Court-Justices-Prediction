justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
listening
to
this.
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
you're
saying,
one,
the
employer
decides
to
terminate,
okay?
now
that's
done.
then
we
go
to
the
next
question.
how
would
we
terminate?
and
in
respect
to
that,
i
think
justice
kennedy
was
asking,
as
i
heard
him,
don't
you
have
a
fiduciary
duty
when
you
decide
how.
and
your
answer,
as
i
heard
it,
was
yes,
you
do.
and
now
there
is
a
third
question.
does
what
happened
in
terminating
mean
that
although
you
have
a
fiduciary
duty,
you
couldn't
consider
a
merger,
because
that's
just
not
consistent
with
the
basic
plan
of
terminating.
is
that
right?
if
it's
wrong,
don't
even
bother
to
answer
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
you
answer
yes
to
his
question,
justice
kennedy's,
about
the
insurance
company?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the...
i'm
trying
to
work
this
out
now.
suppose
i
buy
the
annuity
for
these
employees
from
the
x
insurance
company,
all
right,
and
so
the
insurance
company
promises
when
they
retire
we'll
pay
them
a
thousand
dollars
a
month.
suppose
the
company
goes
bankrupt.
does
the,
what
is
it,
the
pgpb,
what
do
you
call
it,
the
pension
guarantee--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
do
they
pick
up
any
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do
not,
okay.
so
i'm
trying
to
understand
this,
then,
the
reg
under
this,
and
it
says:
administrator,
you
buy
the,
the
annuity
from
an
insurance
company,
for
example,
or
do
the
same
thing,
get
an
irrevocable
commitment
in
another
permitted
form.
so
one
question
is
when
they
do
that
the
administrator
doesn't
have
to
have
any
fiduciary
thought
in
his
mind.
the
second
position
is...
that's
their
position.
the
second
position
is,
even
if
that's
so,
this
is
not
another
permitted
form
because
a
merger
isn't
a
determination.
and
the
third
position
is,
that's
what
we
were
just
getting
to,
is
that
we
don't
see
any
way
in
which
this
could
help
the
employee.
now
you
say,
oh
yes,
there
is
a
way.
now
suppose
we're
choosing
between
two
insurance
companies.
insurance
company
a
says:
we
will
pay
precisely
what
is
owed,
precisely;
we're
as
solid
as
a
rock.
insurance
company
b
is
hungry
for
business,
so
it
says:
we'll
give
those
employees
exactly
what's
owed
and
we'll
write
each
of
them
a
check
for
$500.
now,
is
that
something
that
means
then...
remember,
this
statute
says
you
have
to
get
what
they
promised
them
and
not
a
penny
more.
is
that
something
that
the
insurance,
the
administrator
then
has
to
do?
he
has
to
take
b
because--
the
insurance
company
is
promising
him
a
bonus?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
if
not
that
why
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
go
back
for
just
one
second
to
justice
alito's
question,
because
that's
what
i'm
having
trouble
with,
because
i
think
the
question
is
what,
assuming
you're
right
on
all
the
other
points
for
argument's
sake,
but
what
is
the
advantage
to
the
worker
here?
and
the
answer
i
heard
you
give
was
the
advantage
is,
well,
maybe
the
worker
if
he
goes
and
works
in
the
right
place
will
get
some
more
money.
well,
and
i
wonder
is
that
relevant.
and
you
told
me
in
respect
to
the
two
insurance
companies
it
wasn't
relevant.
so
if
it
isn't
relevant
in
respect
to
the
two
insurance
companies,
how
can
that
be
relevant
here,
and
if
that
isn't
relevant
here
what
is
the
possible
advantage
to
the
worker?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you're
saying
that
the
answer...
we
have
annuity
company
a
and
b,
they're
identical,
the
worker
has
a
pension
that
promises
them
$1,000
a
month,
not
a
penny
more,
and
company
a
says,
we'll
give
you
$500
extra.
then
in
your
opinion
under
the
current
regs
and
so
forth,
the
administrator
must
choose
that
company;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
they
are
equivalent
in
terms
of...
of
the
security
and
so
forth;
they
are
each
good
companies
and
one
will
write
out
a
check
for
$500,
which
is
what
i
thought
my
example
was.
and
now
you're
saying
under
the
law
the
fiduciary
must
choose
the
first
but
you're
hesitating
on
that
which
means
i
think
i
don't
understand
it
fully.
