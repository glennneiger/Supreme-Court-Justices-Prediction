is
what's
really
involved
in
this,
who
is
going
to
get
the
$5
million
reversion
that
you
would
get
if
you
purchased
an
annuity?
is
that
what's
really
in
dispute?

i
mean,
pace
would
like
it,
you
would
like
it.
i
mean,
how
would
a
fiduciary
decide
between
those
two,
if
it
were
a
fiduciary
duty.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
the
beneficiaries
be
better
off
if
there
were
a
merger?
what
would
their
benefit
be,
as
opposed
to
an
annuity?
