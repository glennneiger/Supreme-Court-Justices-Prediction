justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
if
you're
correct
and
this
was
a
sponsor
decision,
not
a
fiduciary
decision,
let
me
ask
you
when
you're
wearing,
when
the
company
is
wearing
its
sponsor
hat
and
says
we're
going
to
terminate
this
plan,
does
it
have
a
duty
to
consider
the
best
interests
and
the
security
of
the
employees,
number
one,
when
it
picks
an
insurance
company?
it
can't
pick
some
flaky
insurance
company
if
there
is
a
much
more
solid
insurance
company,
can
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
have
this
duty
to
consider
the
interest
of
the
employees
in
selecting
the,
the
insurance
company,
in
selecting
the
amount
of
the
annuity,
etcetera,
if
you
have
that
duty
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
fiduciary
duty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
that
that's
one
answer.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have...
there
are
two
arguments
here.
and
what
we
are
exploring
now
is
whether
this
is
a
fiduciary
obligation
or
a
sponsor
obligation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
will
have
to
assume
for
that...
if
you
can't
do
it
by
merger,
then
the
whole
case
goes
away
anyway.
if
merger
is
not
permitted
under
the
statute,
then
we
don't
need
to
worry
whether
it's
a
fiduciary
response,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
we're
asking
in
the
first
part
of
this
argument
is
whether
or
not
it's
a
fiduciary
response.
and
that's
what
justice
souter
and
i
are
questioning.
and
it
does
seem
to
me,
assume
that
there
is
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors,
we
think
we
are
going
to
terminate
this
plan.
at
that
point,
choices
are
made
as
to
how
to
terminate
it.
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
the
interests
of
the
employees
are
not
uppermost
in...
in
your
duties,
i.e.
a
fiduciary
duty,
when
you
decide
how
you're
going
to
terminate
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you
say
it's
a
business
decision
as
to
which
insurance
company
you're
going
to
select.
maybe
you
do
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
way
you
characterize
it.
i
don't
know
why
it's
mere
execution,
when
it's
an
annuity
and
it's
not
mere
execution
when
it's
a
merger,
once
the
determination
decision
has
been
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
alito's
question,
and
i
have
the
same
question.
let's
assume,
a...
i
know
this
is
not
your
position...
but
the
merger
is
a
permissible
option.
and
b...
and
i
know
this
is
not
your
position...
that
this
is
a
fiduciary
obligation.
i
assume
then
you
would
lose,
because
the
extra
assets
must
go,
the
reversion
interest,
must
go
to
the
employees
if
it's
in
their
benefit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
say
that
if
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation,
and
the
merger
is
a
permitted
option,
that
the
administrator,
a,
can,
or
b,
must
still
give
the
money
back
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
administrator,
as
a
fiduciary,
can
consider
the
interest
of
the
employer
as
well
as
the
employees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
an
administrator
make
that
decision
in
its
fiduciary
capacity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
plan
document
provide
that
upon
termination
the
employer
is
entitled
to
a
refund
of
any
excess
funding?
and
would
that
then
be
binding
on
an
administrator
in
a
fiduciary
capacity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
the
administrator
would
then
have
the
duty
to
obey
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
couldn't
the
pbgc
say,
you
know,
we
are
not
quite
sure
how
these
insurance
companies
work.
so
we'll
buy
the
annuity
and
then
the
five
million
is
an
extra
guarantee
to
make
sure
the
annuities
are
paid
and
that
also
goes
to
the
insurance
company?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
prevail
won't
plan
documents
or
shouldn't
plan
documents
be
amended
to
say
that
merger
is
not
an
option
and
any
reversion
goes
to
the
employer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
could
the
administrator,
how
could
the
administrator
negotiate
with
the
employer
to
give
the
$5
million
back
if
it's
with
a
fiduciary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
if
it
would
have
been
amended.
but
what
happens,
what
happens
if
the
employer
wants
to
continue
in
business,
but
simply
turn
the
plan
over
to
a
multiemployer
plan?
is
that
a
fiduciary...
and
you
have
an
employer
that
wears
two
hats.
the
employer
is
also
the
administrator.
is
that
a
fiduciary
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
it's
the
ongoing
significance
of
the
decision
to
the
employer
that
determines
whether
there's
a
fiduciary
obligation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
see
why
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation
in
case
a...
a
sponsor
obligation
in
case
a
and
a
fiduciary
obligation
in
case
b.
that
just
depends
on
the
sequence
of
timing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
i'm
just
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
if
the
employer
finds
the
rock
solid
insurance
company
under...
pardon
me,
the
administrator
finds
the
rock
solid
insurance
company
under
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
under
(i)
he
must
consider
all
other
options
under
(ii)?
