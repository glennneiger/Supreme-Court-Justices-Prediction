i
could
understand
that
if
the
plan
is
being
set
up
or
if
there's
going
to
be
a
change
to
the
multiemployer
plan
while
the
business
is
ongoing.
but
in
this
situation,
you,
you
say
if
the
employer
elects
to
have
an
annuity,
then
choosing
which
insurance
company
is
going
to
supply
the
annuity,
that
would
be
a
fiduciary
function.
well,
this
is,
the
termination,
the
merger
that's
proposed
here,
is
instead
of
having
an
annuity
we'll
put
the
assets
into
this
other
plan.
it's
quite
different
from
choosing
a
form
for
an
ongoing
operation
and
saying,
we're
out
of
it
and
we're
now
going
to
try
to
distribute
the
assets
in
the
way
that
will
best
protect
the
beneficiaries.
justice
ruth
bader

suppose
the
argument
is
made
very
forcefully
that
the
insurance
companies
with
these
annuities
haven't
been
doing
so
well,
but
there
is
this
multi-employer
plan
that
has
been
just
performing
so
well,
and
so
the...
an
appeal
is
made
to
the
company,
you're
going
out
of
business,
you're
not
going
to
be
running
a
plan
anymore.
put
those
assets,
distribute
those
assets
to
the
place
where
they
will
serve
the
employees
best.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
making
the
same
rigid
argument
that
mr.
baker
made,
that
whatever
the
termination,
even
though
the
company
is
going
out
of
business,
it's
bankrupt,
it's
always...
a
merger
is
always
characterized
as
a
sponsor
business,
not
fiduciary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
specific
in
the
plan
or
it
just
didn't
exclude,
the
plan
didn't
exclude
the
possibility
of
merger?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
could
be
if
they
just
didn't
say
anything
so
it
would
be
a
choice.
just
like
it
doesn't
say,
may
not
say
anything
about
a
lump
sum,
which
would
be
an
alternative.
but
your
point--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
i
understand
that
your
position
is
twofold?
one
is
you
say
you...
you
put
this
on
the
table,
the
board
was
bound
to
consider
it
with
their
fiduciary
hat.
so
it's
not
just
that
they
were
to
consider
it.
but
they
had
to
consider
it
as
a
fiduciary
and
not
as
a
sponsor?
