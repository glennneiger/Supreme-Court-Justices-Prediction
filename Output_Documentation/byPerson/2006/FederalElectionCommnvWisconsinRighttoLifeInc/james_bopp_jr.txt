mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
government's
problem
here
is
that
they
are
repudiating
the
very
studies
and
expert
witness
testimony
that
this
court
relied
upon
in
recognizing
a
distinction
between
sham
issue
ads
and
genuine
issue
ads.
that
was
a
methodology
that
the
government
created
and
this
court
relied
upon.
now
they
are
converting
genuine
issue
ads
which
they
identified
in
the
record
through
their
expert
testimony
and
their
studies.
these
ads
are
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
on
pages
159
to
167.
their
expert
based
upon
their
studies
testified
that
these
were
genuine
issue
ads.
now
they
refused
to
state,
as
they
do
here,
refused
to
state
a
test
to
determine
what's
a
genuine
ad.
so
we
are
left
trying
to
comply
with
this
law
and
mount
the
as-applied
challenges
that
this
court
said
is
available
to
us
to
look
at
these
ads
and
determine
what
essential
features
there
are
of
these
ads.
and
as
i
will
explain
further
later,
these
are
grassroots
lobbying
ads
of
the
type
not
like
jane
doe
or
yellow
tail,
but
as...
but
exactly
the
type
of
the
pba
ad,
for
instance,
which
we
have
focused
on,
which
is
on
page
166
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
in
these
studies,
and
these
experts,
they
only
looked
at
the
text
of
these
ads
to
determine
whether
they
were
genuine
or
sham.
there
was
no
testimony
about
the
subjective
intent
of
the
speaker.
there
was
no
testimony
about
the
particular
groups
who
ran
these
ads
on
whether
or
not
their
pac
was
supporting
a
particular
candidate.
no
expert
in
mcconnell
speculated
about
the
possible
effect
of
any
particular
ad
to
determine
whether
it
was
genuine
or
sham.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
there
was
no
testimony
in
mcconnell
that
that
ad,
it...
for
those
that
determined
whether
or
not
it
was
sham
or
genuine,
that
ad
was
sham
or
genuine,
there
was
no
testimony,
no
reference--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
did
indeed.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
if
there's
no
workable
test--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--if
there
is
no
workable
test
that
is
reasonably
ascertainable
by
small
grassroots
organizations
that
separates
genuine
issue
ads
from
sham
issue
ads...
this
court
in
ashcroft
said
you
cannot
throw
out
the
protected
speech
in
order
to
target
unprotected
speech.
and
the
line
of
argumentation
that
the
government
is
presenting
simply
ignores
the
fact
that
at
least
we
have
a
dilemma,
we
have
congress
in
session
during
the
blackout
periods,
voting
on
items.
and
we
have
in
the
first
amendment
one
of
the
four
indispensable
freedoms,
your
right
to
petition
the
government.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
because
facial
upholdings
can
only
be
sustained
constitutionally
if
as-applied
challenges
are
adequate
to
protect
the
protected
speech.
and
this
case
demonstrates
that
that
is
probably
impossible.
it
is
certainly
demonstrating
that
when
the
government
has
changed
its
criteria,
it
is
using
criteria
that
it
rejected
previously
now
to
say
genuine
issue
ads
which
we
asked
this
court
to
rely
upon
in
their
testimony
and
studies
as
genuine
issue
ads,
that
they
are
repudiating
those.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
because
they--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
the
wisconsin
right
to
life
ads
are
in
every
material
respect
indistinguishable
from
these
six
grassroots
lobbying
ads.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
consistently
rejected
the
idea
of
looking
to,
you
know,
outside
the
message
of
the
speaker
such
as
subjective
intent
or--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
that
test
that
has
been
articulated
by
the
government
would
invite
ads
to
be
prohibited
based
upon
the
varied
understandings
of
the
listener,
and
that--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--you
do
that
all
the
time
based
upon
the...
the
test
is,
what
do
the
words
say?
what
does
the
ad
say?
what
does
the
speech
say?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
what
do
they
mean.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
there
were
two
huge
big
studies
on...
two
in
'98
and
2000,
and
there
was
absolutely
no
testimony
about
the--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
there
is
relevant
context,
such
as
the
person
named,
the
incumbent
is
a
candidate.
that
would
be
a
relevant
context.
it
is
broadcast
within
60
days
of
a
general
election,
in
which
he
is
a
candidate
as
well
as
a
voting
member
of
the
senate.
that
would
be
context.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
because
it
simply...
it
would
prohibit
all
speech
because
no
one
would
know
in
advance
whether
or
not
there
would
be--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
have
no
idea.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
because
of
one
or
two
press
releases?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
that
anyone
in
wisconsin
knew
his
position
on
the
filibuster.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
we
can't
run
the
ads,
we
can't--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--if
we
can't
run
the
ads,
we
can't
draw
peoples
attention
to
the
web
site.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no,
but
i
don't--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--look,
polls
show
that
a
majority
of
the
people
don't
even
know
who
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
is.
so
to
suggest
that
they
know
a
particular
position--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no,
that
we
be
allowed
to
speak
so
we
can
give
that
information
to
the
voters.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
but
you
said--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
because
of
your
decision
in
beaumont,
which
creates
a
distinction
between
contributions
and
independent
speech,
and
this
is
independent
speech.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
very
readily.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
problem
is
you're
not
giving
force
to
the
other
conclusion
of
all
three
district
court
judges
that
there
were
genuine
issue
ads.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
that
these
ads,
you
know,
fall
under
a
different
line
of
cases.
first
national
bank
versus
bellotti
has
held
that
corporate
efforts
to
influence
legislative
and
executive
branch
officials--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--it
was
indeed.
it
was
to
lobby
him
about
the
upcoming
vote.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
as
it
turns
out,
because
in
2006
we
ran
the
same
sort
of
anti-filibuster
ads
and
senator
kohl,
now
up
for
reelection,
changed
his
position
on
the
filibuster.
so
these
things
happen.
in
other
words,
people...
people's
positions
are
affected
by
grassroots
lobbying,
and
at
least
people
should
have--
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
grassroots
lobbying.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
we
are
hopeful,
your
honor.
and
that
our
part...
our
system
of
self
government
is
based
upon
the
self-government
of
the
people
and
their
ability
to
influence
the
actions
of
governmental
officials.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
yes,
we
have,
which
would
require
the
adoption
of
a
reasonably
ascertainable
test,
one
that
people
would
not
be
subject
to
three
years
of
litigation,
scorched
earth
litigation
tactics,
intrusive
discovery
into
every
aspect
of
their
organization
for
decades.
it
would
have
to
be
clear,
simple,
and
objective
and
be
able
to
be
implemented
on
short
notice,
because
things
pop
up,
like
the
filibuster
of
a
supreme
court
nominee
in
january
of
2006.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
based
on
their
evidence
in
mcconnell
and
these
grassroots,
and
these
genuine
issue
ads,
i
think
there
are
three
key
or
essential
features
of
those
ads
that
we
are
satisfied
would
protect
grassroots
lobbying
and
genuine
issue
ads.
the
first
is
based
upon
the
content
of
the
communication,
they
focus
on
a
current
legislative
matter,
take
a
position
on
it,
urge
people
to
contact
them,
their
congressmen
and
senators,
to
take
a
particular
action
or
position.
secondly--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--second,
the
ads
do
not
mention
an
election,
candidacy,
political
party,
challenger,
or
the
official
character,
qualifications,
or
fitness
for
office.
that
was
the
key
link
the
district
court
found,
that
these
ads
not,
as
buckley
said...
and
of
course
mcconnell
was
litigated
under
buckley...
is
that
they
were
not
unambiguously
candidate-related.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
the
third
one
is,
as
long
as
the
ad
meets
this
pattern,
that
the
fact
that
the
ad...
ours
does
not...
but
the
fact
that
the
ad
mentions
the
name,
the
position
of
a
public
official
on
an
issue
and
praises
or
criticizes
him
or
her
for
that
does
not
affect
its
genuineness.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
in
a
much
more
expansive
and
comprehensive
test
which
looks
to
three
features
of
the
ad.
but
in
any
event,
you
look
at
the
words
all
the
time.
is
it
fighting
words?
you
look
at
what
are
the
words,
what
are
they
saying?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
i
think
we
have
a
relatively--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--and
i
think
we
have
a
relevant
context.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
you
certainly
have
in--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
relevant
context,
that
there
is
an
election
upcoming,
so
it's
within
60
days.
the
person's
a
candidate.
these
are
relevant...
and
for
that
matter,
whether
the
is
a
current
legislative
branch
matter
or
likely
to
arise
in
the
near
future.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
standard.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
so
giving
meaning
to
one
side
was
upholding
it
facially.
now
your
job
is
to
give
meaning
to
the
other
side,
which
is
genuine
issue
ads
that
are
to
be
protected
as
applied.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
even
if
you
use
balancing,
you've
already
used
it.
you
upheld
it
on
its
face,
because
you
said
the
vast
majority
were
shams.
at
the
same
time,
you
said
there
were
genuine
issue
ads.
you
reserved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
interest
is
sufficient,
the
governmental
interest
is
sufficient,
to
prohibit
genuine
issue
ads
in
footnote
88.
you
know,
they
refuse
to
give
the
test.
they
refuse
to
tell
us
what
is
the
standard.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
did--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
we're
not
trying
to
get
out
of
the
holding
in
mcconnell.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
thank
you.
but
the...
we're
trying
to...
actually--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no,
our
first--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--our
first
step
is
we
want
to
give
meaning
to
the
promise
of
mcconnell
that
there
were
genuine
issue
ads
that
could
be
protected
by
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes,
we
have.
we
have
demonstrated
how
these
ads
are
materially
identical
to
the
genuine
issue
ads
this
government
presented
to
this
court
and
you
relied
upon
that
representation.
we
have
demonstrated
why
and
their
experts
have
agreed
that
the
yellowtail
ad,
the
jane
doe
ad,
is
completely
different
than
our
ad.
their
experts
say
that
our
ads
are
grassroots
lobbying
ads.
now,
we
are
faced
with
a
change
in
position
of
the
government.
i
mean,
in
mcconnell
the
government
said
naming
a
candidate
is
critical.
now
their
experts
say
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
name
a
candidate
or
not,
any
genuine
issue,
any
ad,
can
influence
an
election
if
you
mention
an
issue.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
i
just
think
that
misrepresents--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--i
think
that
simply
misstates
the
effect
of
this
ad.
if
anybody
wanted
to
influence
an
election
with
this
ad,
this
was
the
most
remote,
attenuated,
speculative
way.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
and
that
has
been
also
misstated
in
the
briefing
here.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
on
the
web
site
about
anything
other
than
the
filibuster
issue.
there
was
nothing
about
the
pac
or
what
the
pac
was
doing.
it
was
all
about
the
filibuster.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
of
course.
it
was
about
senator
feingold's
position.
it
was,
the
one
change--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--only
on
the
filibuster,
yes.
it
identified...
the
ads
don't,
the
website
does...
identified
the
position
of
senator
feingold
on
the
filibuster
and
criticizes
him
for
that.
now,
if
that
is
to
be...
you
know,
number
one,
the
whole
first
amendment
was
adopted
to
allow--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--no.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
no.
we
don't
believe
that
that's
part
of
the
context.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
but
see,
the
fec
doesn't
even
regulate
what's
on
the
internet.
you
can
do
anything
you
want
on
the
internet--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--we
have
not
referred
to
context.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
we
are
not
importing
in
our
analysis--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
would
it?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
perhaps,
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
you're
talking
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
statute
that
incorporates
the
cited
to
website.
you
know,
perhaps.
but
that's
much
different
than
a
constitutional
standard
on
what
this
court
is
going
to
look
to.
we
have
no
notice
of
this.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
perhaps.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
a
considered
response
to
that
question.
but
that
is
much
different
than
what
we
are
faced
with.
we
are
faced
with
ad
hoc
criteria
that
is
being
used
by
the
government.
they
reject
examining
subjective
intent
because
it's
unworkable.
now
they
want
to
examine
subjective
intent.
they
disclaim
to
this
court
and
justice
scalia's
question
about,
well,
anything
that
might
influence
an
election,
can
we
regulate
it?
they
said
no.
well
now
they
are
claiming
that,
that
anything
that
might
influence
an
election--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
i
disagree
with
that
holding
of--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
believe
they
have
the
same
functional--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
lost
that
argument
in
this
court.
so
you
know,
i'm
not
trying
to
relitigate
mcconnell.
i'm
trying
to
give
meaning
to
mcconnell.
i
mean,
you
talked
about
genuine
issue,
as
this
court
did.
their
experts
identified
genuine
issue
ads.
they
said,
as
this
court
said
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
i,
as-applied
challenges
can
be
brought.
and
so
we're
trying
to
give
meaning
to
that,
that
there--
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
--in
the...
as
a
broadcast
ad?
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
yes.
because
whether
you
praise
or
criticize
a
government
official's
action
in
office
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
falls
under
the
first
amendment's
protection
of
petitioning.
in
fact
that's
what,
you
know,
the
kind
of
information...
we
didn't
do
that.
but
that's
the
kind
of
information
that's
very
relevant
to
the
constituent's
effort
to
petition.
mr.
james
bopp,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in
various
places
it
