mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
mcconnell
against
fec
this
court
upheld
title
ii's
restrictions
on
electioneering
communications
by
unions
and
corporations
against
facial
attack.
in
doing
so,
this
court
reviewed
a
voluminous
record
and
concluded
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
ads
that
had
been
run
in
previous
cycles
and
came
within
the
statutory
definition
could
constitutionally
be
regulated
by
congress.
accordingly,
this
court
rejected
the
overbreadth
challenge
and
upheld
the
statute
on
it
face.
to
be
sure,
the
last
time
this
case
was
before
the
court
the
court
made
clear
that
nothing
in
mcconnell
foreclosed
an
opportunity
for
as-applied
challenges
to
the
statute
and
the
court
remanded
the
case
for
that
purpose.
but
to
be
consistent
with
mcconnell's
overbreadth
decision,
any
as-applied
challenge
cannot
have
the
effect
of
calling
into
question
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
statute's
applications.
yet
the
district
court's
decision
below
has
precisely
that
forbidden
effect.
there
is
nothing
atypical
about
the
three
ads
that
are
before
this
court.
indeed,
they
closely
resemble
the
jane
doe
hypothetical
ads
that
this
court
identified
at
page
127
as
the
prototype
of
ads
that,
although
they
took
the
form
of
issue
ads,
nonetheless
were
functionally
equivalent
to
express
advocacy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
you
were
wrong,
and
i
suppose
that
obviously
you
thought
the
rest
of
the
court
was
wrong
in
mcconnell,
and
if
the
court
wants
to
reconsider
that
decision...
i
mean,
that's
an
option
the
court
can
take
in
the
appropriate
case.
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
appropriate
case
for
a
number
of
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
i
think
it
was
briefed
in
this
case
really
as
something
of
an
afterthought,
not
as
a
principal
focus
of
the
briefing.
in
the
mcconnell
case
this
court,
as
you
well
remember,
had
an
unbelievably
exhaustive
record
before
it
in
making
a
judgment
about
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
i
don't
think
you
were.
and
although
you
didn't
have
this
case
before
you,
you
had
many,
many
concrete
cases
before
you
that
are
really
indistinguishable
from
this
case.
you
had
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
guess
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
how
you
would
decide
whether
it's
typical.
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
question.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
try
to
come
at
it
this
way,
which
is
to
say
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you're
not
going
to
overturn
mcconnell,
you're
just
going
to
apply
it
and
say,
well,
what
kind
of
as-applied
challenges
are
left,
i
would
have
thought
that
what
you
would
have
in
mind
is
ads
that
had
an
identifiable
characteristic
that
marked
them
as
being
outside
of
the
mainstream
and
somehow
different
from
most
of
the
ads.
and
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--one
strong
indicator
that
these
are
in
the
mainstream
is
how
close
they
are
to
the
jane
doe
hypothetical
that
this
court
identified
as
the
prototype
of
the
kind
of
ads
that,
although
they
took
the
form
of
issue
ads,
they
looked
like
issue
ads,
they
really
were
indistinguishable
from
and
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
were
hundreds.
i
mean,
as
you
well
remember,
there
were
hundreds
of
ads
in
the
record.
and
this
court
was
able
to
draw
conclusions
about
them
both
by
looking
at
some
of
the
specifics,
but
also
looking
at
the
forest,
if
you
will.
one
of
the
things
they
recognized,
for
example,
is
that
these
ads
weren't
turning
up
uniformly
wherever
issues
were
being
debated.
these
ads
turning
up
in
the
close
elections,
in
the
close
races.
and
there
was--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
court
used
70
percent,
it
could
mean
80
percent,
it
could
mean
90
percent.
equally
importantly,
on
page
207
of
the
opinion,
when
it
was
specifically
addressing
overbreadth,
it
made
the
argument,
it
made
the
conclusion,
that
both
in
absolute
and
relative
terms
this
statute
was
not
substantially
overbroad.
and
it
seems
to
me
then
at
a
minimum
for
any
as-applied
challenge
to
be
consistent
with
that
overbreadth
determination,
it
can't
have
the
effect
of
opening
up
the
statute
wide
open
such
that
on
a
going
forward
basis
the
majority,
certainly
a
substantial
number,
percentage,
inconsistent
with
an
overbreadth
holding,
of
the
ads
that
would
be
run
by
unions
and
corporations
within
the
last
60
days
of
the
election
would
qualify
for
the
exception.
that
just
seems
inconsistent
with
the
overbreadth
holding.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
referred
to
all
ads
that
would
come
within
the
statutory
prohibition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
there
were
so
many
issue
ads
in
the
record
in
mcconnell
that
if
issue
ads
were
an
appropriate
category
for
as-applied
challenges,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
this
court
to
reject
the
overbreadth
burden.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
the
only
other
obvious
candidate
that
we
could
carve
out
would
be
express
advocacy.
and
the
court
was
clear
in
footnote
18
of
the
opinion
what
percentage
that
was,
4
to
5
percent.
so
as
to
the
95
percent
of
the
ads
that
didn't
engage
in
express
advocacy,
this
court
still
had
no
difficulty
concluding
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
were
within
congress'
conception
of
the
purposes
of
the4
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
one
way
to
divide
it.
you're
using
the
term
"issue
ad".
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
you're
use
the
term
"issue
ad"
as
if
it's
self-defining.
i
don't
view
it
that
way.
and
i
mean,
even
appellee
has
tried
to
narrow
it
to
grassroots
lobbying.
now,
of
course
there's
a
problem
with
the
grassroots
lobbying
argument
and
that
is
it
was
made
to
this
court
in
mcconnell,
and
at
that
time
the
nature
of
the
argument
wasn't,
oh,
grassroots
lobbying,
that's
a
sort
of
idiosyncratic
or
atypical
application
that
would
give
rise
to
a
narrow
as-applied
exception.
no,
the
argument
there,
and
a
great
illustration
is
appellee's
national
affiliate,
national
right
to
life.
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
reply
brief
in
mcconnell,
they
argued
about
grassroots
lobbying
and
said,
boy,
this
statute
applies
to
grassroots
lobbying,
therefore
it's
substantially
overbroad.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
saying
that.
my
point
is
that
not
all
as-applied
challenges
are
created
equal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
as...
i
mean,
look,
my
job
is
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
so
i'm
not
suggesting
that
any
of
these
as-applied
challenges
would
necessarily
success
or
i
wouldn't
be
up
here
trying
to
make
some
argument
in
defense
of
the
statute.
but
let
me
give
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
then,
let
me
give
you
an--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--let
me
give
you
some
inspirational
as-applied
challenges
that
would
be
better
as-applied
challenges
than
this
one.
a
challenge
by
a
501(c)(3)
corporation
that
has
difficulty
separating
up
a
separate
segregated
fund.
much
better
as-applied
challenge.
the
challenge
that
was
brought
in
the
maine
case
that
you
have
before
you
in
another...
in
another
petition
or
another
appeal,
that
was
a
challenge
to
an
ad
that
was
run
in
an
unopposed
primary.
that
starts
to
sound
like
a
pretty
good
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,--
justice
scalia,
it
would
be
a
better
case
if
that
were
the
claim.
there's
no
doubt
that
appellee
has
a,
a
pac,
a
separate
segregated
fund.
to
their
claim
isn't
that
they
didn't
have
one.
their
claim
is
it
was
underfunded
vis
a
vis
what
it
would
cost
to
fund
these
ads.
but
that
itself
is
clearly
a
conscious
decision,
because
if
you
look
at
how
much
money
they
had
in
their
pac
in
2000,
they
had
155,000
or
something
like
that
in
their
pac.
plenty
to
pay
for
this
ad.
this
time
around
they
had
13,000.
now
why
is
that?
it's
pretty
clear
from
the
record
that
they
shifted
their
emphasis
not
to
getting
money
for
their
pac,
but
to
get
money
in
their
general
corporate
treasury
to
fund
these
ads.
and
so
they
raised
300
million
dollars
in
corporate
funds.
but
that's
not
hat
doesn't
make
this
a
good
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think,
i
think
a
501(c)(3)
corporation
has
a
much
better
as-applied
challenge
if
they
can
bring
it.
and
that's
the
as-applied
challenge
that's
sort
of
been
discussed
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs.
the
problem
is
appellee
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
that,
because
they
are
a
501(c)(4)
corporation.
another
example
of
a
better
challenge
would
be
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
from
the
earlier
argument
which
would
be
a
corporation
that
runs
a
series
of
ads
and
then
wants
to
continue
to
run
them
during
the
election
cycle.
well,
that's
not
guilty
this
case,
but
it
well
could
be.
the
filibuster
issue
isn't
something
that
came
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
on
the
eve
of
the
election.
throughout
2003,
there
were
filibusters
in
the
senate
on
a
pretty
regular
basis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
see...
you
may
be
right
that
certainly
people
do
tend
to
focus
on
issues
in
the
context
of
an
election.
but
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
bear
out
the
conclusion
that
people
only
care
about
them
at
those
times
or
that
groups
don't
bother
running
ads
at
other
times.
i
mean
if
you
look
at
the
2005
time
frame,
the
record
reflects
that
a
number
of
groups,
not
appellee,
but
a
number
of
groups
had
issue
ads
addressing
the
filibuster
issue.
and
what's
interesting
about
that
to
me
is
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
45
and
46
for
the
examples
they
were
able
to
do
it
in
terms
of
tag
line,
"earth,
call
the
senate".
and
if,
if
appellee
had
run
those
same
ads
which
would
capture
the
issue,
then
they
wouldn't
even
have
come
within
the
statute.
so
it
does
illustrate
both
that
this
is
an
issue
that
drew
enough
public
interest
to
generate
ads
at
different
time
periods,
not
just
in
the
reelection
context,
and
even
when
did
it
that,
it
was
possible
to
engage
on
the
issue
without
coming
within
the
confines
of
the
statute.
so
it
just
seems
like--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kennedy,
it's
certainly
possible.
i
don't
think
it's
common,
though.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
just
to
go
back
to
the
record
in
mcconnell,
the
one
thing
the
record
there
made
pretty
clear
is
when
you
got
to
the
period
60
days
before
the
election,
these
ads
were
not
being
ran
in
a
way
that
would
have
some
random
distribution
that
you
might
expect
if
they
were
just
interested
in
the
issues
or
just
interested
uniformly
in
all
reelections.
these
ads
were
really
concentrated
in
the
close
districts.
i
mean
one
of
the
lines
that
stick
out
in
my
mind
from
the
record
is
in
trying
to
fund
money
for
these
so-called
issue
ads,
the
club
for
growth
executives
said
"we
need
money
for
these
issue
ads
because
they
make
all
the
difference
in
close
elections.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
if
your
point
is
that
there
may
be
an
interest
in
trying
to
leverage
the
upcoming
election
to
get
somebody's
attention--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no
doubt
that's
true.
but
i
think
it
also
implicates
the,
the
interests
of
congress
in
the
statute
that
this
court
recognized
and
upheld
on
its
face.
when,
when
the
whole
point
is,
we're
not
just
interested
in
this
issue
in
the
abstract,
and
we're
not
running
this
issue
just
because
there's
a
pending
vote
in
congress;
we're
interested
in
running
this
ad
because
it's
a
pretty
effective
vehicle
both
to
defeat
this
candidate's
reelection
chances,
but
if
we
don't
succeed
on
that
maybe
we'll
convince
him
to
change
his
mind.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well...
i
don't
know,
the
fact
that
by
the
time
they
ran
these
ads
senator
feingold
voted
20
times
out
of
20
to
filibuster
suggests
to
me
that
they
probably
concluded
that
the
best
to
get
a
wisconsin
senator
who
wouldn't
filibuster
was
to
change
senators
not
to
change
to
change
senator
feingold's
mind.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
obviously
the
statute
itself
in
its
bright
line
test
doesn't
make
you
get
into
those
kind
of
inquiries.
but
if
their
claim,
if
they
come
into
court
and
say
well,
we
had
a
pure
heart;
we
didn't
have
an
intent
to
affect
the
election--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure
i
am,
justice
scalia.
i'm
giving
you
the
statute,
on
its
face,
which
couldn't
be
clearer.
if
you
want
to
have
as-applied
exceptions,
if
you
want
to
go
down
the
road,
to
quote
the
chief
justice
in
dissent
in
mcfl,
of
creating
"barely
adumbrated
exceptions",
you
may
inject
some
vagueness.
now
that
may
be
necessary.
and
there
may
be
as-applied
challenges
out
there
that
do
the
trick
without
creating
vagueness.
but
i
don't
think
this
is
the
one.
and
just
because
the
first
as-applied
challenge
you
see
is
a
problematic
one
doesn't
mean
this
aren't
better
as-applied
challenges
out
there.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first,
i
would
like
to
stress
the
virtue
of
as-applied
challenges.
you
might
wonder
in
the
abstract,
wasn't
there
a
problem
with
the
statute
that
applies
to
a
group
running
a
series
of
ads
and
then
one
of
them
falls
in
the
period.
but
then
you
look
at
an
as-applied
challenge
and
you
see
that
didn't
happen
here.
in
fact,
the
opposite
did.
this
issue
was
percolating
since
march
of
2003.
these
ads
were
run
some
500
days
after
the
first
filibuster
vote.
both
before
and
after
senator
feingold's
reelection
cycle,
they
addressed
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
if
you're
looking
for
an
as-applied
challenge
that's
going
to
identify
a
genuine
issue
ad,
i
would
think
that
it
would
go
somewhat
to
intent.
and
i
would
think
the
reason
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
our
position
is
slightly
different
than
intervenors
on
that
point.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
the
series
of
ads
hypothetical
is
beguiling
is
because
it
suggests
that
because
they
run
the
same
issue
ad
all
the
time,
they
must
be
interested
in
the
issue,
not
the
election,
and
the
opposite
is
true
here.
they
run
ads
about
this
issue,
they
run...
they
have
communications
about
this
issue
outside
of
the
period
of
senator
feingold's
reelection.
they
don't
rely
on
broadcast
ads.
they
rely
on
e-alerts
when
it's
not
during
the
election
cycle.
but
when
it's
during
the
election
cycle,
all
of
a
sudden
they
start
running
broadcast
ads.
and
i
think
it
shows
what
the
timing
suggests.
the
timing
here
suggests
an
intent
to
influence
the
election,
not
an
intent
to
engage
on
the
issue.
mr.
paul

clement
no,
you
don't.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
they
don't,
justice
scalia,
and
one
of
the
arguments
that's
made
to
try
to
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
reconsideration
of
mcconnell
is,
as-applied
checks
don't
work.
how
can
you
say
that?
in
the
two
cases
that
have
been
brought,
there
were
preliminary
injunction
proceedings
that
were
completed
before
the
blackout
period
began.
so
in
that
case,
bring
your
preliminary
injunction
if
you
have
a
question.
but
the
virtue
of
as-applied
challenges,
and
the
last
thing
i'll
say,
is
the
virtue
of
as-applied
challenges,
they're
not
all
created
equal.
just
because
this
as-applied
challenge
fails
doesn't
mean
the
statute
isn't
open
to
them.
