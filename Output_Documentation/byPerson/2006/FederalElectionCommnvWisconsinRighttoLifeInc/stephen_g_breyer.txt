justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
you
tell?
i
rather
liked
the
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
rather
liked
the
one
we
had
before
about
senator
faircloth,
and
his
ad
was,
senator
faircloth
is
against
the
trial
lawyers
and
their
efforts
to
increase
liability
laws,
so
write
him.
now,
testimony
all
over
the
place.
that
is
the
advocacy
candidate
ad
of
the
century.
and
you
couldn't
possibly
know
that
without
having
known
that
one
of
the
parties
had
spent
millions
trying
to
paint
faircloth's
opponent,
senator
edwards,
as
the
creature
of
the
trial
lawyers,
that
anyone...
that
anyone
in
north
carolina
knew
it.
so
they
read
those
words
and
they
understand
precisely
what's
at
stake.
they're
saying
vote
against
edwards,
vote
for
faircloth.
you
just
tell
me
how
anyone
could
know
such
a
thing
without
looking
at
the
context.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
people
offered
to
bring
in
such
facts
as...
there
was
a
web
site
address
here.
it
says,
indeed
oddly,
don't
phone
the
senator.
go
look
at
the
web
site.
and
if
you
look
at
that
web
site,
it
says
defeat
him,
defeat
him,
defeat
him.
i
mean,
that
sounds
as
if
they
have
defeat
in
mind.
so
certainly,
there
are
about
four
or
five
things
which
they
said
to
look
at
outside
the
four
corners.
so
i'm
not
certain
what
it
is
in
the
law
that
says
that
you
only
look
to
the
four
corners.
i
mean,
i
read
the
opinion
below.
did
you
read
it,
by
the
way,
the
1,000-page
opinion?
i
bet
you
did,
the
1,000-page
opinion
of
the
district
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
then
you
know
like
i
know,
and
it
took
me
a
week,
and
it
probably
took
you
less,
but
you
know
what
that
record
was
like
in
the
case,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
that
as
i
read
it,
i
drew
one
conclusion.
the
one
conclusion
was
if
there's
a
law,
and
it's
a
good
law
under
the
constitution,
if
it
is,
that
corporations
and
labor
unions
cannot
give
money
to
political
campaigns.
and
if
it
is
true,
as
it
is
true,
that
what
political
campaigns
are
about
now
is
television.
and
if
it
is
true,
as
it
is
true,
that
these
are
the
single
lion's
share,
the
single
best
way
to
get
somebody
defeated
or
elected,
then
if
you
open
the
gates
and
say
corporations
and
rich
givers
or
whatever
can
contribute
by
writing
these
ads
and
paying
for
them,
forget
the
first
two
premises.
forget
the
rule
that
says
corporations
can't
contribute.
now,
i
put
all
that
in
front
of
you.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
asking
for
is
for
us
to
overturn
mcconnell
and
to
say
either
in
practice
or
in
theory,
mccain-feingold
campaign
finance
law
is
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
are
asking
for
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
it's
exactly
as
justice
scalia
said.
if
we
agree
with
you
in
this
case,
good-bye
mccain-feingold.
maybe
we
should
do
it
up
front.
that's
what
you
advocate.
very
well.
would
you
address
that?
why
should
this
court
only
a
year
or
two
after
it
upholds
mccain-feingold,
accept
a
position
that
either
in
fact
or
in
theory
overturns
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's,
that's
the
point,
because
where
i
get
into
my
chain.
you
have
an
argument.
i'm
not
denying
that.
i
understand
it.
but
it's
sort
for
me
deja
vu
all
over
again.
we've
heard--
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
happened
before...
either
you
can
distinguish
this,
which
i
don't
see
how
frankly,
or
you're
back
into
the
chain,
and
if
you
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
the
chain,
i
didn't
draw
it
to
the
final
ending
there,
if
i
take
most
of
the
ads...
and
that's
what
that
kollar-kotelly
opinion
is
about.
that's
what
that
1,000-page
record
is
about.
that's
what
the
10,000
pages
of
testimony
were
about.
that's
what
mccain-feingold
was
about,
and
all
those
witnesses.
they
said
in
today's
world
these
are
the
kinds
of
ads
people
run
just
to
defeat
people.
and
then
they
said,
moreover,
most
of
the
campaign
money
goes
on
them.
and
then
they
said,
moreover,
if
you
let
corporations
and
labor
unions
contribute
to
these,
well,
then
they
can
contribute
to
the
campaign.
and
the
only
thing
i
left
out
before
was,
if
you're
prepared
to
say
the
constitution
requires
us
to
let
corporations
and
unions
buy
these
kinds
of
ads,
well,
how
could
it
be
constitutional
to
have
a
statute
that
forbids
them
to
contribute
directly
to
the
candidate,
something
that's
been
in
existence
only
since
i
guess
1904?
but
how
could
that
be
constitutional
if
they
can
just
give
this
money
directly?
why
can't
they
give
this
same
money
to
the
candidate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
i
mean,
1,000
is
what
we
have
here,
is
we
happen
to
have
three
criteria,
absolutely
clear:
does
it
mention
the
candidate?
does
it
run
within
30
or
60
days
before
the
election?
and
is
it
targeted
to
an
electorate?
now,
that's
clear.
now,
if
you're
prepared
to
say
that's
unclear,
i
don't
understand
it,
you
don't
need
a
1,000-page
record
about
that.
all
you
need
is
a
record
where
you
have
your
organization
to
come
in
and
show
how
yours
is
significant
different
from
the
mine
run
of
cases.
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes.
yes,
i
see
you
could
distinguish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
fact
this
isn't
the
first
amendment
totally
on
one
side.
isn't
this,
isn't
this
a
case
where
the
courts
held
that
there
are
very
significant
constitutional
interests
on
both
sides
of
the
equation,
which
is
what
makes
this
kind
of
thing
difficult.
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
suggesting
why
a
pure
first
amendment
test
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
question
and
why
we've
upheld
mccain-feingold.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
theory
is
that
the
ad
itself
on
the
web
site,
in
your
opinion,
would
have
been
okay?
you
turn
to
the
web
site
three
months
before
the
election.
it
says
16
times
out
of
16
in
the
past
two
years,
feingold
and
kohl
have
voted
to
filibuster
certain
of
the
president's
nominees.
feingold
and
kohl
are
putting
politics
into
the
court
system,
creating
gridlock
and
costing
taxpayers
money.
now
three
months
before
the
election
you
put...
write
that
in
your
ad.
now,
is
that
in
your
opinion
constitutionally
protected,
gets
it
out
of
mccain-feingold?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
what
you
did,
suppose
instead
of
what
you
ran,
you
know,
in
a
broadcast
ad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
that
is
protected?
