mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to...
i'd
like
to
address
three
points
that
came
up
at
the
earlier
part
of
the
argument.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to,
i
think
just
with
respect
correct
a
premise
of
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions.
then
i
would
like
to
address
the
two
questions
that
i
think
i
heard
the
chief
justice
ask,
which
is
how
do
we
know
that
the
this
is
an
atypical
ad,
and
what
would
the
standard...
what
standard
would
a
court
apply
in
adjudicating
as-applied
challenges?
and
then
finally,
assuming
there's
time
permitting
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
why
we
shouldn't
revisit
mcconnell
which
i
think
was
posed
both
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
scalia.
first,
as
to
the
premise,
justice
scalia,
and
it
relates
to
what
the
predicate
was
of
the
now
famous
vast
majority
reference.
i'm
quoting
from...
it's
entirely
clear
from
this
court's
opinion
and
i
believe
it's
on
page
207
that
the
referent
was
issue
ads.
in
fact,
what
this
court
said
was
the
precise
percentage
of
issue
ads
that
clearly
identified
a
candidate
and
were
aired
during
those
relatively
brief
pre-election
time
spans
but
had
no
electioneering
purpose
is
a
matter
of
dispute
between
the
parties
and
among
the
judges
on
the
district
court.
nevertheless,
the
"vast
majority"
of
ads
clearly
had
such
a
purpose.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
think
the
test
is
whether
or
not
it
is
as
this
court
indicated,
i
think,
whether
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy.
it
doesn't
use
the
magic
words
but
does
it
have
the
same
effect,
that
is,
the
test
that
this
court
should...
not
this
court,
a
district
court
adjudicating
an
as-applied
challenge
that
is
based
on
the
content
of
the
ad
not
the
sort
of
as-applied
challenge
brought
in
mcfl
or
brown
versus
the
socialist
workers
parties
that
relate
to
the
nature
of
the
speaker,
but
one
that's
based
on
the
content
requires
the
challenger
to
show
okay,
in
a
context
of
a
statute
that
is
facially
valid
and
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
the
vast
majority
of
ads
that
are
covered
by
the
definition
of
electioneering
communications,
he
needs
to
come
in
and
show
that
with
respect
to
this
ad,
it
has
characteristics
such
that
no
reasonable
voter
could
view
it
as
promoting,
attacking,
supporting
or
opposing
a
candidate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
you...
i
think
the
rule
is
quite
clear
that
you
never
do
that.
this
strict
scrutiny
clearly
applies
here.
but
in
the
context
of
a...
the
application
of
a
statute
that
has
already
been
upheld
as
facially
constitutional
in
the
vast
majority
of
applications,
the
government
doesn't
have
the
burden
of
reconvincing
the
district
court
the...
what
the...
the
very
things
that
the
supreme
court
has
already
decided.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's...
well,
we
would
have
an
awful
lot
of
laws
if
everything
you
wrote
constituted
law
and
a
holding.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
that
statement
and
a
statement
that
follows
shortly
after
it
on
the
following
page
were
essential
to
this
court's
decision
that
applying
the
strictest
possible
scrutiny,
this
law
was
very
narrowly
tailored.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think...
well,
an
electioneering
ad,
justice
alito,
i
think
puts
too
much
of
a
burden
on
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that
what
a
district
court
would
say
is
could
a
reasonable
voter
in
the
targeted
electorate
have
understood
that
this
ad
was
in
part
promoting,
attacking,
supporting,
or
opposing?
the,
the
acronym
is
paso.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i,
i
would
think
so.
if
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
would
depend,
as
your
question
suggests,
on
the
context
in
which
the
ad
is
run.
now
i
want
to
make
two
points
with
respect
to
your
inquiry.
number
one,
as
this
court
has
reiterated,
we're
not
talking
about
a
ban
here.
any
one
of
these
ads
can
be
run
so
long
as
it
is
funded
the
same
way
that
the
election
law
requires
them
all
to
be
funded.
that
is,
with
money
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
love
it.
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
aclu
as
an
example
because
many...
their
brief
is
quite
powerful.
they
and
the
other
amici
who
provide
a
growing
table
of
amicus
briefs
every
time
this
issue
comes
up,
have
never,
ever,
brought
their
own
as-applied
challenge,
although
those
these
groups
are
not
shy
to
litigate
when
they
think
important
rights
are
in
effect.
they
have
been
in
the
three
years
since
this
court
decided
mcconnell,
and
in
the
year
since
this
court
made
clear
what
i
think
we
had
assumed,
which
is
this
statute
is...
it
is
open
season
on
as-applied
challenges.
there
have
been
precisely
two
as
as-applied
challenges
brought,
both
brought
by
the
counsel
in
this
case.
the
aclu's
brief
which
is
as
representative
as
any
other
says
look
at
these
ads
that
we've
been
running
about
really
important
issues:
the
war
in
iraq,
guantanamo,
etcetera,
etcetera,
here
is
the
text
of
the
ad.
if
we
had
put
onto
a
tag
line
of
that
ad,
please
call
senator
so
and
so
and
tell
him
no,
we
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
it.
well,
you
know
what?
with
one
exception
that
i'll
explain
in
a
minute,
in
its
90-year
history,
the
aclu
has
never...
way
before
bickler
was
passed,
even
outside
the
60-day
period,
they
never
put
that
line
on.
and
you
know
why?
it's
because
they
have
pledged
to
their
members
and
to
the
public
that
they
will
not
engage
in
electioneering
of
any
sort.
they
are
completely
nonpartisan
and
they
don't
ever
want
to
be
understood
to
the
contrary,
and
so
they
never
utter
those
words.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
though,
i
mean,
i
think
it
does
demonstrate
a
few
things.
first
of
all,
it
is
entirely
possible,
as
this
court
reiterated
in
mcconnell,
for
the
exact
same
message
or
an
equally
effective
message
to
be
given
at
any
particular
time.
if
the
aclu
or
the
national
rifle
association
or
any
of
the
other
groups
that
never
wants
to
actually
bring
an
as-applied
challenge
but
always
wants
to
say
oh
no,
no,
no,
this
is
horrible,
wants
to
run
an
ad,
as
this
court
has...
they
can
establish
a
separate
segregated
fund.
and
if
they
come
in
and
convince
a
court
that
that's
impractical
or
impossible,
maybe
they
get
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
anybody
would
claim
that.
even
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not...
i
wasn't...
i
don't
mean
to
pick
on
the
aclu.
i
think
highly
of
both
organizations
and
many
of
the
amici
that
are
arrayed
against
me.
the
point
is
that
i
use
the
aclu
as
an
example
because
the
reason
they
never
put,
they
never
name
a
congressman
is
because
they
don't
want
their
ads
to
be
perceived
as
breaking
faith
with
what
they
tell
the
public.
as
for
the
nra,
the
nra
actually
did
bring
a
challenge
against
the
fec
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
said,
"we
don't
really
qualify
under
mcfl
because
we
take
some
corporate
funds,
but
it's
de
minimis
and
we
think
that's
what
the
supreme
court
had
in
mind.
"
"you
know
what?
"
"they
won.
"
"but
they
can't
take
yes
for
an
answer.
"
"they
want
to
establish
that
this
law
is
facially
unconstitutional.
"
"and
that
does
go
to
the
point
i
think,
if
i
may,
as
to
why...
well,
it...
why
you
shouldn't
reexamine
mcconnell
for
first
principles.
"
but
let
me
just
say
in
response
to
your
very
first
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
reason
that
we
know
that
this
ad
is
typical
is,
as
this
court
created,
articulated
the
paradigm
of
an
electioneering
communication,
the
test
in
the
jane
doe
example,
and
this
case
is
materially
indistinguishable
from
the
jane
doe
ad.
that
is
one
that,
quote,
"condemns
jane
doe's
record
on
a
particular
issue
before
exhorting
viewers
to
call
jane
doe.
"
here
we've
got
an
ad
that
denounced
the,
quote,
"group
of
senators
who
had
filibustered
judicial
nominees.
"
--may
i
finish
my
sentence?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
that
statement
from
jane
doe
is
knowing
that
senator
feingold
was
part
of
that
group,
and
reasonable
listeners
in
the
context
of
the
ad
itself
and
the
web
site
would
certainly
have
known
that.
thank
you.
