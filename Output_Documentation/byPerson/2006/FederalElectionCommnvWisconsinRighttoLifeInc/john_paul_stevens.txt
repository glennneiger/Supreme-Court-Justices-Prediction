are
you
trying
to
convince
us
the
purpose
of
these
ads
was
to
convince
senator
feingold
to
change
his
position
on
filibusters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
had
much
chance?
do
you
think
that
was
a
realistic
goal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
rather
basic
question?
do
you
agree
that
the
constitution
permits
congress
to
pass
a
statute
that
prohibits
your
using
electioneering
ads
that
use
magic
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
also
prohibit
you
from
using...
urging
everyone
to
look
to
a
web
site
that
used
the
same
magic
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
your
web
site
used
the
magic
words,
then
your
ads
would
be...
could
be
regulated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
would
agree
the
statute
could
be
validly
applied
to
an
ad
that
says
look
at
this
website,
and
the
web
site
then
uses
the
magic
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
believe
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
be
violated
by
an
ad
that
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
one
that
contained
magic
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
might
be
an
upholdable
constitutional
difference
between
two
ads
that
convey
the
same
message.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they're
the
functional
equivalent,
by
hypothesis,
they
convey
the
same
message.
