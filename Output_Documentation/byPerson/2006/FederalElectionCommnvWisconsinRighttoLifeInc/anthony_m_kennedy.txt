we
all...
we
all
know...
maybe...
i
think,
i
think
it's
accepted,
that
the
public
only
tunes
in
to
the
political
dialogue
shortly
before
the
election.
that's
the
time
in
which
you...
in
which
you
reach
the
public.
so
the
fact
that
the
filibuster
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
is...
i
don't
think
answers
the
question
as
to
how
speech
can
be
the
most
effective.
justice

are,
are
there
frequent
issues...
instances
in
the
political
process,
do
you
think,
in
which
the
public
runs
an
ad
against
a,
a
candidate
knowing
the
candidate
is
probably
going
to
win
anyway,
he
or
she
is
from
a
safe
district,
or
it's
very
difficult.
but
they
want
to
run
the
ad
anyway
in
order
to
affect
his
conduct
or
her
conduct
once
they're
reelected,
so
that
they'll
take
a
different
position,
a
second
look.

it...
it
seems
to
me
logically
that's
possible.
i
just
don't
know
if
that,
if
that
happens
very
often.

is
that
called
democracy?
justice
anthony
m.

we
look
at
fighting
words
in
a
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
one
thing
to
say
something
in
a
bikers
bar
and
another
thing
in
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
many
cases
where
we
look
just
at
the
words?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
shout
"fire"
in
a
crowded
theater;
it
has
to
be
a
crowded
theater.
