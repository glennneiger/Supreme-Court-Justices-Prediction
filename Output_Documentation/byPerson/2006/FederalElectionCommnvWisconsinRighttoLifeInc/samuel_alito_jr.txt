but
the
test
as
to
any
ad
is
whether
any
reasonable
person
could
view
the
ad
as...
as
an
electioneering
ad?
justice

any
reasonable
person
could
view
it
as
what?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
same
group
has
long
had
ads
on
a
particular
issue,
and
let's
say
a
particular
candidate's
position
on
the
issue
is
very
well
known
to
people
who
pay
attention
to
public
affairs.
and
let's
say
we're
in
the
black
out
period
and
now
important
vote
is
coming
up
on
congress
on
that
very
issue.
if
the
group
continues
to
run
the
ad
on
that
issue,
that...
a
reasonable
person
could
view
that
as,
as
saying
something
about
the
election,
couldn't
it?
couldn't
that
person?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
would
be
prohibited?
justice
samuel

alito,

what
do
you...
what
do
you
make...
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
there
are
so
many
advocacy
groups
that
say
this
is
really
impractical?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
long
will
the
blackout
period
be
during
the
upcoming
year
for
the
presidential
candidates?
