justice
david
h.
souter
you're
taking
this
because,
in
effect
on
a
four
corners
facial
criterion.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
is
whether
that
is
an
appropriate
methodology,
so
will
you
address
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
not
talking
about
subjective
intent
here.
we're
talking
about
what
justice
breyer
raised
a
moment
ago.
that
is,
we
are
looking
for
the
public
political
context
in
which
the
ad
is
run.
he
gave
the
example
of
the
faircloth
edwards
ads.
anyone
in
north
carolina
knew
what
they
meant.
someone
in
idaho
or
new
hampshire
probably
did
not,
because
they
did
not
know
the
context.
your
argument,
seems
to
me
is,
ignore
the
context.
and
my
question
is,
why
should
we
ignore...
why
should
we
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
any
communication
depend
upon
the
understanding
of
the
listener?
can
we
even
sensibly
talk
about
what
a
statement
means
or
an
advertisement
means
without
understanding
the
context
in
terms
of
the
listener's
understanding?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the
question
is,
what
do
the
words
mean.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
the
words
mean
without
knowing
the
context
in
which
they
are
spoken.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
is,
why
should
we
ignore
the
context?
how
can
we
tell
what
something
means
without
the
context?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
those
don't
go
to
meaning
in
the
sense
of,
for
example,
the
faircloth
edwards
example
does.
why
should
we
ignore
the
aspects
of
context
which
determine
meaning,
i.e.,
the
understanding
that
a
listener
would
have?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
the
people
in
north
carolina
were
unaware
of
the
edwards
position,
they
were
unaware
of
the
distinction
between
faircloth
and
edwards?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course
they
knew
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course
they
knew
that.
and
just
as
presumably,
you
knew
the
position
of
senator
feingold
in
these
advertisements,
and
the
people
in
the
state
knew
because
of
your
other...
because
of
your
other
public
statements.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
those
things
be
ignored?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
they're
dumb?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
a
web
site.
you
have
a
web
site
that
calls
their
attention,
and
you
think
nobody's
going
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
nobody's
paying
attention
to
what
the
senator
is
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
the
only
source
of
information
about
senator
feingold
is
your
advertisement?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
if
your
advertisement
is
not
the
sole
source
of
information,
then
why
do
you
assume
that
no
one
in
wisconsin
knows
what
the
senator
has
been
doing
when
he
votes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
position
is
that
we
ignore
context
because
no
one...
because
the
voters
aren't
smart
enough
to
have
a
context?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
give
us
the
third
one.
i
want
to
go
back
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
may
i
go
back
to
your
second
criterion?
it
seems
to
me
your
second
criterion
is
simply
the
injection
of
magic
words
back
again.
you're
saying
if
we
don't
use
certain
magic
words
it's
okay.
that's
a
magic
words
test.
you're
not
looking
for
any
particular
word.
you're
looking
for
the
meaning
and
breadth
of
the,
of
the
item.
well,
but
you
said
if
we
don't
mention
the
election
and
the
candidacy
of
this
person
for
this
election,
that
is
one
of
the
sufficient...
one
of
the
conditions
with
the
other
three
which
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
the,
on
first
amendment
grounds,
justify
running
the
ad.
that
seems
to
me
simply
to
be
reinjecting
magic
words
in
a
negative
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
test
to
determine
whether
you
fall
within
this
sort
of
heartland
of
the
statute
which
we
upheld
on
facial
challenge.
yours
is
a
test
where
exclusion
from
the
facial
rule;
isn't
that
correct?
that's...
that
was
why
you
were
giving
the
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
you
gave?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
saying:
i
have
three
criteria
and
if
i
satisfy
those
criteria,
then
the,
then
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute
is
not
an
answer
to
my
claim.
that's
basically
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
of
course,
if
you
success
in
that
you're
saying,
okay,
the
government
then
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
strict
scrutiny.
that's
the
reason
for
your
test,
isn't
it,
to
get
you
out
of
mccain-feingold...
i
mean,
to
get
you
out
of
the
holding
in
mcconnell?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
you're
saying
this
is
an
applied
challenge
which
is
different
in
some
relevant
respects,
so
that
the
facial
holding
in
mcconnell
shouldn't
apply
to
us,
it
shouldn't
bar,
shouldn't
justify
the
government
barring
our
ad.
isn't
that
your
logic?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
want
to
go
further
than
that,
i
know.
but
that's
your
first
step.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
you
were
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
way
to
do
that
is
say,
there's
something
different
about
my
case
from
the
case
which
was
taken
as
typical
in
upholding
statute
against
facial
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your,
your
principle
concern
at
this
point
is
getting
yourself
out
from
the
holding
of
mcconnell,
in
other
words,
by
saying
we
have
a
case
which
was
not
the
typical
case
in
mcconnell,
that's
why
it's
an
as-applied
challenge
and
that's
why
this
is
a
new
ball
game.
and
i
take
it
your
principle
argument
for
that
in
criticizing
the
government's
position
is
that
the
government
didn't
use
to
say
that
there's
something
significant
or
something
insignificant
about
naming
the
candidate,
and
now
they
do.
that
it
seems
to
me...
if
i
understand
your
argument...
goes
back
to
this
context
argument
or
not.
because
the
argument
that's
being
made
is,
in
context
we
know
perfectly
well
what's
going
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
you
shouldn't
look
at
the
context.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
did
you
refer
them
to
the
web
site?
there's
nothing
remote
or
speculative
about
what
happens
when
they
look
at
the
web
site.
justice
david
h.
souter
anything
about
senator
feingold?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
web
site
indicate
the...
the
wisconsin
right
to
life's
position
on
senator
feingold?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
part
of
the
context,
isn't
it?
in
other
words,
you're
supplying
some--
justice
david
h.
souter
--context
for
the
ad.
you're
saying,
if
you
want
to
know
the
context
in
which
we're
saying
this,
look
at
the
website.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
believe
that's
what
you
are
doing.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
fec
doesn't
regulate
anything
else
in
the
broader
political
context
except
what
the
statute
allows.
my
point
is,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
referring
to
context.
why
therefore
is
it
illegitimate
for
a
court
to
look
to
context?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
the
chief
justice
said
less
than
four
years
ago
on
a
case
called
mcconnell
against
federal
election
commission
this
court
reviewed
to
claim
that
section
203
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
commonly
called
mccain–feingold
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
rejected
that
challenge
and
held
that
provision
facially
constitutional.
that
same
provision
is
challenged
today
as
applied
specifically
is
applied
to
particular
broadcast
advertisements
run
by
the
appellee
corporation
wisconsin
right
to
life
incorporated.
today
a
majority
of
the
court
holds
that
section
203
cannot
be
applied
constitutionally
to
regulate
the
corporation’s
advertisements.
the
courts
reasoning
is
directly
at
odds
with
the
reasoning
in
mcconnell
and
a
portion
of
mcconnell
that
upheld
section
203
on
its
face
is
therefore
effectively
overruled.
justice
stevens,
justice
ginsberg,
justice
breyer
and
i
respectfully
dissent.
in
conjunction
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
section
203
limits
a
corporation
or
union
from
broadcasting
a
political
advertisement
within
60-days
on
election
or
30-days
of
primary.
when
the
ad
refers
to
a
clearly
identified
candidate
for
federal
office
and
is
targeted
to
the
candidate’s
electoral
district.
the
corporation
of
union
may
maintain
a
separate
political
action
committee
that
can
run
such
an
ad
but
the
corporation
or
union
cannot
do
so
directly
by
using
its
general
funds.
section
203
was
enacted
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
had
been
brewing
for
over
a
century.
in
the
year
1907
corporations
were
forbidden
to
make
contributions
from
corporate
funds
directly
to
federal
candidates
in
the
1940s
the
same
limitation
was
imposed
on
unions.
in
each
case
the
reason
was
obvious
corporations
and
unions
can
assemble
a
lot
of
money,
money
given
to
a
political
candidates
has
string
attached,
people
understand
this
and
the
consequence
understanding
a
cynicism
about
the
democratic
process.
both
the
reality
of
the
strings
attached
and
cynicism
about
democracy
are
serious
threats
to
the
integrity
of
representative
government.
encountering
those
threats
to
governmntal
integrity
is
an
interest
of
compelling
importance.
bans
on
contributions
however
became
increasingly
ineffective
as
time
went
by
because
independent
corporate
and
union
expenditures
aimed
at
supporting
or
defeating
a
candidate
had
the
same
effects
impose
the
same
threat
as
direct
contributions
to
the
candidate.
congress
consequently
perceive
the
need
to
limit
expenditures
as
well
as
contributions.
in
the
most
recent
effort,
results
of
its
efforts,
was
the
enactment
of
section
203.
back
in
2003
in
the
mcconnell
case
the
main
attack
on
section
203
was
that
it
not
only
limited
advertisements
directly
urging
the
election
or
defeat
of
identified
candidate
but
would
also
limits
so
called
issue
ads.
advertisements
calling
attention
to
some
public
issue
and
urging
a
listener
to
get
in
touch
with
a
senator
or
representative
to
express
views
on
the
subject.
in
mcconnell
this
court
held
that
the
objection
was
not
strong
enough
to
show
that
section
203
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
a
restriction
on
corporate
or
union
speech.
one
reason
for
that
conclusion
was
that
the
great
majority
issue
ads
that
would
be
limited
would
in
fact
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
direct
election
hearing
urging
the
election
or
the
defeat
of
a
candidate.
we
gave
a
simple
example
an
advertisement
describes
a
problem
it
tells
you
that
senator
or
representative
jane
doe
has
been
taking
the
wrong
position
on
the
problem
and
urges
you
to
call
jane
doe.
if
jane
doe
is
also
out
for
election
at
the
time
anybody
will
get
the
message
that
jane
doe
should
be
defeated.
mcconnell
said
the
section
203
was
constitutional
as
to
that
kind
of
advertisement.
the
advertisement
that
led
to
the
case
now
before
as
were
like
the
jane
doe
ads.
they
flag
filibusters
against
judicial
nominees
as
an
abusive
power
they
directed
their
listeners
to
the
website
that
identified
senator
feingold
of
wisconsin
as
a
senator
who
engaged
in
such
filibustering.
the
ads
told
the
listeners
to
call
senator
feingold
who
express
their
feelings
and
this
at
the
very
time
that
senator
feingold
was
up
for
a
reelection.
the
clear
message
was
defeat
senator
feingold.
if
the
jane
doe
ad
can
be
regulated
so
can
the
appellee’s
ad
and
senator
feingold
and
filibusters.
if
the
filibuster
ad
cannot
be
regulated
constitutionally
neither
can
the
jane
doe
ad.
the
court
says
that
the
filibuster
ad
cannot
constitutionally
be
regulated
and
the
unmistakable
consequence
of
that
is
the
mcconnell’s
holding
that
section
203
is
facially
constitutional
is
overruled.
section
203
then
is
a
dead
letter
and
the
100
year
ban
on
corporate
and
union
contributions
can
now
be
awaited
so
easily
as
to
be
rendered
academic.
it
is
high
to
know
right
this
moment
the
exact
effect
today’s
decision
will
have
on
future
efforts
in
campaign
finance
reform.
it
does
seem
fair
to
say
though
all
that
the
structure
of
constitutional
analysis
employed
by
today’s
majority
leaves
congress
powerless
to
deal
straightforwardly
with
the
serious
threats
to
the
integrity
of
government
and
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
in
these
circumstances
they
will
necessarily
be
a
call
for
fresh
thinking
about
how
to
resolve
the
tension
between
corporate
rights
of
free
speech
on
the
one
hand
and
what
president
theodore
roosevelt
described
a
100
years
ago
is
the
authority
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
election
of
its
own
officials
that
is
inherent
in
the
government
of
the
united
states.
