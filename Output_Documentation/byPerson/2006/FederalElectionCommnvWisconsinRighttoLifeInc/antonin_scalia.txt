justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
were
wrong
last
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
have
a
concrete
case
such
as
this
one,
in
which
the
assertions
of
the
other
side
are
very
appealing
as
far
as
the
rights
of
citizens
to
band
together
for
an
issue
ad,
even
an
issue
ad
that
names
somebody
who's
up
for
election
within,
within
90
days.
we
didn't
that
have
appealing
case
before
us.
now
that
we
have
it
before
us
and
now
that
you
tell
us
that
this
is
a
typical
case,
maybe
we
were
wrong
about
the
overbreadth
challenge
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
did
that
statement
refer
only
to
issue
ads,
or
did
it
refer
to
all
ads?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
subset
of
all
ads
and
that
is
issue
ads.
so
that
statement
doesn't
necessarily
speak
to
whether,
you
know,
a
vast
majority
of
all
issue
ads
have
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
if
that's
so.
so
long
as
that
statement
applied
to
the
totality
of
ads,
many
of
which
were
ads
just
directed
at
defeating
particular
candidates,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
see
that
we're
bound
by
that
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
everything
that
is
not
express
advocacy
is
an
issue
ad?
the
world
is
divided
into
express
advocacy
and
issue
ads?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
divide
it
that
way.
i
would
think
there
are
a
lot
of
express
advocacy
ads.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
non-express
advocacy
ads
that
are
not
issue
ads.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
your
case,
with
me
at
least,
for
you
to
tell
us
that
it
is
your
job
to
say
that
no
as-applied
challenge
will
suffice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
doesn't--
inspire
me
with
confidence
in
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
there
is...
there
is
a
claim
here
that
there...
that
there
was
difficulty
in
setting,
setting
up
a
fund
in
time
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
with
respect
to
this
issue,
which
was
a
distinctive
issue
that
had
come
up
and
they
said
we
didn't
have
time
to
set
up
a...
a...
a...
a
separate
pac
that,
that
would
effectively
meet
the
problem.
why
isn't
that
distinctive
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now...
but...
yes,
it
may
make
the
difference
in
a
close
election
but
it
is
also,
it
is
also
likely
to
be
more
effective
with
regard
to
the
senator
that
you...
whose
vote
you
want
on
the
issue.
are
you,
are
you
going
to
waste
your,
waste
your
money
in,
in
those
districts
where
the
senator
is
not
going
to
vote
the
way
you
want
no
matter
what?
the
situation
you
pose
is
precisely
the
one
where
you
would
want
your
issue
ad
to
run.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
get
the
senator's
attention.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
senator
who
is,
who
is
at
risk
is
likely,
is
likely
to
listen.
the
senator
who
has
a
safe
seat
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
tell
which
of
the
two
they
had
in
mind.
whether
they
wanted
the
senator
defeated
or
they
wanted
to
put
enough
pressure
on
the
senator
that
he
would
change
his
vote
with
regard
to
the
filibuster.
i
would
think
that
the
latter
is
more
likely
the
motive
than
the
former.
and
why
do
you
assume
the
worst?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is...
this
is
the
first
amendment.
we
don't
make
people
guess
whether
their
speech
is
going
to
be
allowed
by
big
brother
or
not.
if
you
are
going
to
cut
off
the
speech,
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
line.
not
whether...
whether
i,
i
had
ads
against
feingold
in
the
past
or
whether
feingold
voted
20
times
against
this
or,
or
half
of
the
time
against
this.
it
seems
to
me
you
need
a
clear
first
amendment
line.
and
you're
not
giving
us
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
vast
majority
thing,
is
that
a...
was
that
the
holding
of
the
case?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--every...
every...
every
word
that
we
it
uttered
in
that
prior
case
is
law?
i
mean,
what
if...
am
i
free
to
think...
is
the
lower
court
free
to
think
that
maybe
it
is
really
not
the
vast
majority?
but
just
because
we
said
vast
majority,
it
is
like
writing
it
into
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
true
of
the
nra
also?
is
it
the
case
that
they
have
never
targeted,
so
to
speak,
a
particular
legislator?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they
would
either.
why
pick
on
the
aclu?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
asking
for
that
among
other
things,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that
those
issue
ads
are
inconsistent
with
the
government's
position
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
explained
that.
you're
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
they
put
these
exhibits,
were
those
exhibits
complete
with
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
they
just...
just
like
the
ads
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
easy
to
tell
whether
you're
giving
money
to
the
money
to
the
candidate
or
not,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
fairly
bright
line
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
stepping
over
the
wrong
side
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
this
one,
especially
if
you
adopt
a
context
determination
that
requires
a
1,000-page
district
court
opinion,
who
knows.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
test?
their
test
is
fuzzy,
i
agree
with
you.
what's
yours?
do
you
have
a
clear
one
that
does
not
invalidate
the
whole
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
says
what's
good.
what
is
your
test
for
what's
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bopp,
you
do
not
have
to
establish,
do
you,
that
the
test
you
propose
will
get
at
every
bad
ad,
that
it
will
be
sure
to
get
at
every
ad
that
is
not
a
genuine
issue
ad?
is
that
the
burden
on
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
when
we're
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
we
give
wide
scope
to
the
principle
that
it
is,
it
is
better
to
allow,
you
know,
some
bad
speech
than
it
is,
in
the
effort
to
get
rid
of
that
bad
speech,
to
eliminate
any
good
speech
that
is
justified.
so
even
if
there
is
something
that
might
sneak
through
that
does
achieve
what
congress
didn't
want
to
achieve,
the
answer
in
the
first
amendment
is
that's
too
bad.
there's
some
stuff
you
just
can't
get
at.
there's
a
lot
of
bad
speech
that
is
allowed
all
the
time
because
you
can't
get
at
it
without
suppressing
the
good
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
yes
to
that,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
fears
the
greeks
even
when
they
bear
gifts.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
go
to
their
meaning
or
to
the
intent
of...
is
that
what
governs?
it's
the
intent
of
the
person
who
puts
it
on?
i
thought...
i
thought
you
were
focusing
on
the
meaning
of
it,
what
it
conveys
to
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
new
to
me.
i
thought
you
were
asking
us
to
look
at
the
meaning.
what
does
it
mean
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
could
be
as
long
as
200
days;
isn't
that
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
speculate
before
you
try
to
put
the
ad
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
speculate
whether
the
court
is
going
to
say
well,
since
you're
in
the
zone
of
three
different
radio
stations
or
television
stations,
a
different
rule
applies.
doesn't
the
person
who
wants
to
speak
have
to
speculate,
roll
the
dice?
