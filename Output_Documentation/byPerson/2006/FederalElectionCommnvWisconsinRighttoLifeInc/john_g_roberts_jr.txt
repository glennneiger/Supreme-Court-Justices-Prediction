we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-969,
federal
election
commission
versus
wisconsin
right
to
life,
and
case
06-970,
senator
mccain
versus

right
to

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
whether
this
case...
if
you
think
it's
important
to
our
resolution,
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
whether
this
particular
case
is
typical
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
determine.
therefore,
i
think
it's
hard
to
determine
in
the
abstract
whether
its
inconsistent
with
the
conclusion
in
mcconnell
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases
would
not
be
covered
or
if
it's
inconsistent
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
gets
back
to
my
same
question:
how
do
we
know
that
this
is
or
is
not
outside
the
mainstream.
we
have
just
the
three
ads
that
are
at
issue
here.
it's
not
as
if
we
have
a
survey
of
all
the
ads
that
are
run
during
the
blackout
periods
in
particular
election
cycles.
how
do
we
tell
whether
this
is
within
the
mainstream
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
court
in
mcconnell
used
the
term,
as
you've
used
it
this
morning,
"vast
majority".
what
is
that?
is
70
percent
a
vast
majority,
so
that
30
percent
of
the
ads
are
going
to
be
outside
of
that
and
would
be
candidates
for
this
as-applied
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
suggesting
the
district
court
decision
is
not
consistent
with
mcconnell.
but
it
seems
that
your
approach
today
is
inconsistent
with
our
decision
last
year
that
you
can
have
as-applied
challenges.
you're
suggesting
that
if
we
allow
this
as-applied
challenge
to
go
forward
that
we
have
to
facially
strike
down
the
section.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
tell
me
what
one,
an
ad
that
would
succeed
in
an
as-applied
challenge
looks
like,
or
what
the
standard
would
be
that
we
would
apply
in
a
way
that
you
think
would
not
call
into
question
the
decision
in
mcconnell
about
section
203?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
you're
saying,
though,
is
if
this
as-applied
challenge
succeeds
you're
saying
the
only
way
we
can
do
that
is
if
we
think
that
the
statute
is
facially
unconstitutional.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
if
there's
a
way
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--approaching
this
as-applied
challenge
in
a
way
that
doesn't
require
us
to
revisit
that
prior--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
i,
can
i
understand
you
to
suggest
we
ought
to
draw
a
distinction
in
as-applied
challenges
between
a
501(c)(3)
organization
and
a
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
not
a
501(3)(3)
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that,
is
that
your
test,
if
it
has
any
electioneering
purpose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we,
do
we
usually
place
the
burden
when
we're
applying
strict
scrutiny
under
the
first
amendment
on
the
challenger
to
prove
that
they're
allowed
to
speak,
as
opposed
to
the
government
to
prove...
to
carry
the
burden
that
they
can
censor
the
speech?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
an
important
part
of
their
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
to
petition
their
senators
and
congressmen,
and
to
urge
others
to...
as
in
these
ads...
contact
your
senators,
contact
your
congressmen.
just
because
the
aclu
doesn't
do
that
doesn't
seem
particularly
pertinent
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
bopp?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
bopp,
your
argument
that
mcconnell's
facial
holding
should
be
overturned
appears
on
page
62
of
your
brief.
i
take
it
you
have
at
least
61
page
arguing
that
your
as-applied
challenge
can
succeed
without
overturning
mcconnell's
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bopp.
general
clement,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
also
have
the
announcement
this
morning
and
then
opinion
in
case
no.

election
commission
versus
wisconsin
right
to

and
the
consolidated
case
number
06-970
mccain
versus
wisconsin
right
to
life.
unlike
the
case
we
just
finished
announcing,
these
cases
concern
core
political
speech
not
in
the
school
environment.
they
involve
section
203
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
(bcra).
abbreviation
makes
it
a
felony
for
union
or
corporation
to
broadcast
shortly
before
an
election
any
communication
that
names
a
candidate
for
elected
federal
office
and
is
targeted
to
the
electorate.
three
terms
ago
in
a
case
known
as
mcconnell
versus
federal
election
commission
we
considered
the
claim
that
section
203
violated
the
first
amendment
because
of
it
was
overbroad
on
its
face.
the
objection
was
that
it
covered
not
only
expressed
campaign
advocacy
an
ad
saying
“vote
for
jones”
but
also
genuine
issue
advocacy
an
ad
saying
“here
is
an
issue
we
feel
strongly
about
contact
representative
jones
and
tell
him
to
do
something
about
it."
bcra
was
concerned
about
election
speech
but
section
203
by
it
terms
covers
both
types
of
ads
because
both
mention
the
federal
candidate
by
name.
in
the
mcconnell
case,
this
court
held
that
section
203
was
not
so
overbroad
on
its
face
that
all
enforcement
of
it
should
be
banned.
in
july
2004,
a
nonprofit
corporation
called
wisconsin
right
to
life
(wrtl)
began
broadcasting
radio
ads
that
refer
to
a
group
of
senators
that
was
using
a
filibuster
tactic
to
block
federal
judicial
nominees
from
a
simple
yes
or
no
vote.
the
ads
ended
buying
urging
listeners
to
contact
senators
feingold
and
kohl
the
two
wisconsin
senators
and
tell
them
to
oppose
the
filibuster
because
the
ads
mention
senator
feingold
by
name
and
he
was
up
to
reelection
bcra
section
203
made
their
broadcast
illegal
as
of
30-days
prior
to
the
wisconsin
primary.
believing
it
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
continue
running
these
ads
wrtl
filed
a
suit
against
the
federal
election
commission.
the
district
court
initially
denied
relief
concluding
that
our
mcconnell
decision
essentially
held
that
bcra
section
203
was
constitutional
in
every
application
but
last
term
we
vacated
that
judgment
explaining
that
mcconnell
held
only
that
section
203
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
mcconnell
did
not
purport
to
resolve
future
as
applied
challenges.
on
remand
the
district
court
held
section
203
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
wrtl’s
ads.
the
court
ruled
that
these
ads
were
not
election
advocacy
or
its
functional
equivalent
but
instead
were
genuine
issue
ads
and
no
compelling
interest
justified
their
suppression.
the
federal
election
commission
and
a
group
of
legislators
who
had
intervene
appealed
the
case.
we
began
by
holding
that
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
the
government
argues
that
the
case
is
moot
because
the
2004
election
is
coming
on
and
wrtl
no
longer
desires
to
run
the
particular
three
advertisements
that
are
the
subject
of
this
suit.
we
hold
however
that
these
cases
get
comfortably
within
the
established
exception
to
mootness
for
disputes
that
are
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
that
wrtl
could
have
obtain
complete
judicial
review
of
its
claims
in
time
to
air
its
ads
during
the
bcra
blackout
periods
and
wrtl
credibly
that
a
plans
to
run
materially
similar
are
targeted
broadcast
ads
during
future
blackout
periods.
on
the
merits
a
majority
of
the
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
in
an
opinion
joined
by
justice
alito,
i
find
section
203
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
wrtl’s
ads.
in
mcconnell
the
court
held
that
section
203
properly
regulates
ads
that
are
expressed
election
advocacy
or
its
functional
equivalent.
these
ads
are
not
expressed
election
advocacy,
they
don’t
say,
“vote
for”
or
“against
feingold”
but
how
to
tell
whether
they
are
the
so
called
functional
equivalent
of
such
advocacy.
in
answering
that
question
we
have
to
remember
that
we
are
talking
about
core
political
speech,
public
discussion
and
debate
about
policy
matters
and
the
ability
of
speakers
to
mention
public
officials
in
the
course
of
that
discussion
and
we
need
to
remember
that
we
are
applying
the
first
amendment
which
provides
“congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.”
now,
this
court
has
not
adopted
an
absolutist
interpretation
of
that
amendment
but
it
is
important
in
considering
a
law
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
mention
an
elected
official
by
name
to
recall
the
scope
of
the
words
that
the
framers
use.
in
light
of
this
the
test
for
deciding
whether
these
ads
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
expressed
campaign
speech
cannot
turn
on
amorphous
factors
like
the
speaker
intent
or
the
possible
effect
of
the
ads
on
voters.
the
test
cannot
turn
on
multiple
contextual
factors
it
would
surely
chill
political
speech
if
people
could
not
know
in
advance
whether
they
could
speak
or
would
be
committing
a
felony.
given
these
considerations
a
court
should
find
that
an
ad
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
and
maybe
barred
under
section
203
only
if
the
ad
is
susceptible
of
no
reasonable
interpretation
other
than
as
an
appeal
to
vote
for
or
against
a
specific
candidate.
under
this
test
wrtl’s
three
ads
are
plainly
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
election
advocacy
the
ads
focus
on
a
legislative
issue,
take
a
position
on
the
issue,
exhort
the
public
to
adopt
that
position
and
urge
the
public
to
contact
public
officials
with
respect
to
that
matter.
the
ads
do
not
mention
an
election
candidacy,
political
party
or
challenger
and
they
do
not
take
a
position
on
a
candidate’s
character,
qualifications
or
fitness
for
office.
at
best
the
appellants
have
shown
that
the
distinction
between
discussion
of
issues
on
the
one
hand
and
candidates
on
the
other
may
not
be
that
clear
in
practice
but
under
our
test
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
that
the
ads
can
reasonably
be
viewed
as
advocating
or
opposing
a
candidate
in
a
federal
election.
discussion
of
issues
cannot
be
suppressed
simply
because
the
issues
may
also
be
pertinent
in
an
election.
where
the
first
amendment
is
implicated
the
tie
goes
to
the
speaker
not
to
censor.
so
these
ads
cannot
be
suppressed
because
they
are
light
express
election
advocacy.
we
also
reject
other
asserted
grounds
for
censoring
the
speech
it
is
suggested
that
the
regulation
is
supported
by
the
interest
in
preventing
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
election
campaigns,
and
the
interest
in
addressing
the
distorting
effects
of
corporate
wealth.
neither
interest
however
has
been
extend
into
ads
like
wrtl’s
that
are
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
election
advocacy.
we
conclude
that
extending
them
this
extra
strap
would
be
to
stretch
that
too
far
and
would
call
into
question
our
well
established
holding
that
the
corporate
identity
of
a
speaker
does
not
strip
corporations
of
all
free
speech
rights
because
wrtl’s
ads
are
not
express
election
advocacy
or
its
functional
equivalent,
and
because
appellants
identify
no
interest
sufficiently
compelling
to
justify
burdening
wrtl’s
speech,
bcra
§203
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
wrtl’s
ads.
justice
alito
and
i
do
not
believe
these
cases
present
an
appropriate
occasion
to
revisit
mcconnell’s
holding
that
express
candidate
advocacy
or
its
functional
equivalent
maybe
regulated.
but
when
it
comes
to
defining
what
speech
qualifies
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
subject
to
such
a
ban
the
question
that
us
before
the
court,
we
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
speech
not
censorship.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined.
in
justice
scalia’s
view
the
test
for
as
applied
challenges
under
section
203,
i
have
just
articulated
another
similar
test
are
impermissibly
vague
and
thus
ineffective
to
vindicate
the
fundamental
first
amendment
rights
at
issue.
justice
scalia
believes
this
conclusion
compelled
by
our
decision
in
buckley
versus
valeo
which
rejected
advocacy
of
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
candidate
as
a
statutory
test
because
it
was
too
vague.
at
the
same
time
he
reasons
any
clear
rule
that
would
protect
all
genuine
issue
ads
would
cover
such
a
substantial
number
of
ads
prohibited
by
section
203
that
section
203
would
be
rendered
substantial
overbroad.
thus,
our
decision
in
mcconnell
which
presuppose
the
availability
of
as
applied
challenges
was
mistaken
in
its
approval
of
section
203.
justice
scalia
would
therefore
overrule
that
part
of
the
court’s
decision
in
mcconnell
upholding
section
203(a)
of
bcra.
while
he
agrees
with
the
principle
opinion
of
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
he
otherwise
concurs
only
in
judgment.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
