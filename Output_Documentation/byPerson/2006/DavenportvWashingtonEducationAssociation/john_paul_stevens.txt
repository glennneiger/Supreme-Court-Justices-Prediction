mr.
clement,
if
we
reverse
as
you
suggest
and
the
state
supreme
court
said,
well,
i
guess
we
were
wrong
under
the
first
amendment,
we
just
realized
our
state
constitution
requires
the
same
result,
would
that
judgment
stand,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
on
your
overinclusive,
or
underinclusive
rather,
argument?
supposing
the
statute
was
broader
and
said
the
union
may
not
use
any
non-member
agency
fee
collections
for
any
non-germane
purpose
at
all
without
affirmative
consent?
would
that
solve
all
the
constitutional
problems?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
tell
me
yes
or
no,
and
then
explain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
insofar
as
your
argument
under
inclusiveness,
the
answer
would
have
to
be
that
was,
that
statute
would
be
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
a
statute
that
the
individuals
say
i
don't
want
to
spend
any
more
money,
give
any
more
money
to
the
union
than
i
absolutely
have
to.
and
the
legislature
decides
to
protect
the
right,
that
right
by
saying
you
cannot
use
agency
sock
fees
for
any
non-germane
purpose.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
perfectly
constitutional,
this
is
a
fortiori
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
less
of
a
burden
on
the
union
and
there's
less
protection
to
the
employee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
first
amendment
right
that
is
waived
by
failing
to
make
a
timely
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
gone
under
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
back
to
your
example
about
the
political
party
saying
you
can't
use
it
for
democrats,
what
if
they
said,
as
they
might
have
in
the
1940s,
you
can
use
it
for
anybody
except
communist
candidates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
his
hypothetical
involving
democrats
versus
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
says,
well,
this
is
content
discrimination.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
it's
content
in
the
sense
that
only
some
speech
has
to
be
affirmatively
authorized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
go
back
to,
you
mentioned
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
of
your
answer
to
his
hypothetical
is,
well,
the
viewpoint
discrimination
would
be
impermissible,
but
the
content
discrimination
is
permissible?
