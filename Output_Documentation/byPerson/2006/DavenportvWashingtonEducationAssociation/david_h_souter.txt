justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
can't
the
state
protect
it
more?
i
mean
the
fact
that
hudson
would
be
adequate...
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--from
that
it
does
not
follow
that
the
state
is
not
protecting
the
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
claim
as
i
take
it,
that
there
is
an
infringement
with
the
union's
right
of
political
advocacy,
is
that
if
in
effect
the
scheme
restricts
the
union's
use
of
its
own
funds?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
you
agree
that
the
union
could
segregate
these
funds
as
opposed
to
commingling
them,
and
that
would
cure,
that
would
in
effect
answer
your,
your
constitutional
objection?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
clear
from
the
statute
that,
that
what
you
would
do
would
be
leave
them
subject
to
the
opt-in
determination,
but
all
other
funds,
i.e.,
the
funds
that
you
are
constitutionally
entitled
to
protect,
would
be
unencumbered.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
that
would
create
an
independent
constitutional
problem
assuming
that
you
did
segregate
the
funds?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would,
that
would
create
an
issue?
you
know,
what
if
they
say:
nothing?
maybe,
maybe
the
statute
does
not
deal
adequately
with
that.
but
does
that
raise
a
constitutional
problem
that
in
effect
would
be,
would
be
of
equal
parity
with
the
one
that
is,
that
is
raised
on
behalf
of
the,
the,
the
dissenting
workers?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
back
to
its
funds
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying,
first
you
said
well,
segregating
the
funds
does
not
answer
the
problem.
and
i
thought
the
reason
it
didn't
answer
the
problem
was
that
the,
that
it
was,
that
the
purposes
of
the,
of
the
act
were
underinclusive.
and
now
you're
responding
to
justice
ginsburg
by
going
back
to
making
the
assumption
that
the
segregated
funds
would
be
the
union's
funds.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just...
i'm
sorry.
may
i
just
take
you
back
to
the
point
of
the
objective
being
protection
of
election
integrity.
as
i
understand
it,
so
far
as
the
protection
of
election
integrity
is
concerned,
with
respect
to
these
contributions,
that
is
simply
the
obverse
side
or
the
flip
side,
if
you
will,
of
protecting
the
right
of
the
dissenting
union
member
or
the
non-joined...
strike
that...
the
non-union
worker,
to
control
the
use
of
the
funds
that
would
be
used
for
the
political
purposes.
the
one
is
simply
the
obverse
of
the
other.
do
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
by
articulating
that
the
election
integrity
is
a
purpose,
the
washington
supreme
court
should
not
be
understood
as
excluding
the
protection
of
the
non-member
workers'
interests?
