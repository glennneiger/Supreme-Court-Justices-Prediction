mr.
john
m.
west
thank
you,
mr.
chief...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
submission
that
section
760
unconstitutionally
burdens
the
union's
first
amendment
right
to
engage
in
political
advocacy
rests
on
three
points.
one,
the
statute
before
the
court
is
a
campaign
finance
law
that
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public's
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process.
two,
it
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech,
which
cannot
be
justified
by
the
state's
authority
to
limit
agency
fees
in
the
first
place.
three,
the
statute
does
not
serve
a
compelling
state
interest
both
because
it
is
overbroad
in
restricting,
restricting
speech
on
ballot
propositions
and
because
it's
underinclusive
in
regulating
the
campaign
speech
of
unions
but
not
of
other
comparably
situated
entities.
mr.
john
m.
west
uh,
the
first
amendment
rights--
mr.
john
m.
west
--the...
the...
the
nonmember
employees
certainly
have
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
finance,
help
finance
political,
ideological
and
other
nongermane
expenditures
over
their
objection.
and
that
right
is
fully
protected
independently
of
760
by
the
hudson
process,
and
as
the
washington
supreme
court
held,
when
there
is
the
availability
of
a
ready
means
for
opting
out
of
that
participation
in,
in
financing
those
causes,
there
is
no
compelled
speech.
and
this
is
what
the,
what
the
first
amendment
gives
to
the
nonmember
fee
payers.
mr.
john
m.
west
the
states--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
what
the
state
is
protecting,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
the
first
amendment
right
itself
which
by
definition
is
protected
through
the
hudson
process.
mr.
john
m.
west
the
state--
mr.
john
m.
west
--the
state
can
certainly
protect
the
interest
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
right
more,
or
to
a
greater
degree,
but
if
it
does
so,
it
can
only
do
so
if
it
does
not
infringe
on
other
constitutional
rights.
and
if
it
does
then
the
question
is
whether
the
state's
regulation
that
infringes
on
other
constitutional
rights,
in
this
case
the
union's
first
amendment
right
of
political
advocacy,
whether
that
infringement
is
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
john
m.
west
the
scheme
restricts
the,
the
use
of
funds
that
are,
are
properly
collected
from
agency
fee
payers
by
the
union
and--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
it
wouldn't,
because
then
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
after
you've
segregated
them.
if
the
statute--
mr.
john
m.
west
--certainly
justice
souter,
but
then
the
question
is,
for
those
fee
payers,
and
certainly
there
are
going
to
be
some
out
of
three
or
four
thousand
that
do
not
give
affirmative
authorization,
then
what
do
you
do
with
their
funds?
and
the,
the--
mr.
john
m.
west
--justice
souter,
the--
mr.
john
m.
west
--justice
souter,
the
reason
it
raises
a
constitutional
problem
is
because
of
the
content
discrimination
issue.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
collect
an
agency
fee
that
is
the
full
equivalent
of
union
dues,
but
if
you
choose
to
spend
any
money
from
your
treasury
for
electoral
advocacy,
you
may
spend
whatever
you
want
from
your
treasury
for...
for
legislative
lobbying,
for
public
relations,
for
all
kinds
of
other
issues,
forms
of
speech
that
are
not
chargeable
to
objectors.
but
if
you
choose
to
spend
any
for
one
particular
type
of
speech,
namely
electoral
advocacy,
then
you
must
segregate
and
refund
a
portion
of
the--
mr.
john
m.
west
--to
the
fee
payers.
mr.
john
m.
west
certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
it's
much
harder
on
the
union
in
that
respect
but
not
in
the
respect
that's
critical
here,
and
that
is
the
federal
law
as
well
as
the
laws
of
all
the
other
states
who
have,
have
required
separate
segregated
funds
limit
that
requirement
to
candidate
elections.
the,
the
reason
this
statute
is
unconstitutional,
the
reason
it
does
not
consist
of
a
compelling,
does
not
provide
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
regulating
elections,
is
because
it
goes
far
beyond
the
permissible
realm
of
regulating
expenditures
on
candidate
elections,
and
prohibits
the
union
without
affirmative
authorization
from
spending
its
funds
for
ballot
propositions.
mr.
john
m.
west
whether
they're--
mr.
john
m.
west
--justice
souter,
if
they
are
segregated,
if
the
union
segregates
them,
assuming
they
don't...
for
those
for
whom
they
don't
receive
affirmative
authorization,
they
keep
them
in
escrow
indefinitely,
or
they
put
them
in
a
locked
box
and
never
do
anything
with
them,
certainly
the
union
would
satisfy
the
statute
in...
in
that
way.
but
what,
what
the
statute
says
as
interpreted
by
the
trial
court,
if
then
the
union
puts
those
funds
back
into
its
general
treasury,
or
even
if
it
doesn't,
and
spends
them
in
some
way
for
some
purpose
whatever,
that
it's
violating
the
statute.
and
the
only
way
that
the
union
can
comply
is
by
not
only
segregating
the
funds,
but
then
if
affirmative
authorization
is
not
received,
by
rebating
a
certain
portion
of
the
fund
to
the
individual
fee
payers.
mr.
john
m.
west
sure.
exactly.
and
that's...
and
that's
why
i
think
that
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
may
be
correct.
but
the
problem
we
have
here
is
this
is
a
statute,
and
why
it's
unconstitutional
is
this
is
a
statute
that
is
saying
this
only
with
respect
to
a
particular
kind
of
speech.
it's
saying
the
union
may
collect
a
hundred
percent
of
dues
and
it
may
spend
them
in
whatever
way
it
deems
appropriate
for--
mr.
john
m.
west
--no,
it
doesn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the...
the...
in...
in
the
street
and
abood
decisions,
the
court
has...
has
said
that
there
is...
all...
has
talked
in
terms
of
expenditures
that
are
not
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
john
m.
west
no,
because
this
is
government
funding.
this
is--
mr.
john
m.
west
--i
believe
it
is,
justice
scalia,
because--
mr.
john
m.
west
--it's
strict
scrutiny
if
it's
not
the
government
acting
as
the
speaker,
and
the
government
is
acting
here
as--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
put
it
quite
that
way
in
the
government
speech
cases,
the
government
funding
cases.
mr.
john
m.
west
i
think
the
problem
here...
let
me
say
two
things
in
response
to
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
m.
west
certainly.
well,
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
the
answer
is,
if
you're
talking
about--
[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
west
if...
if
the...
if
you're...
if
what
you're
doing
is
talking
about
the,
an
election
statute
like--
mr.
john
m.
west
--that,
justice
stevens,
if
this
is
what
the
state
is
saying
with
respect
to
the
public
sector
employees
as
to
which
it
has
the
authority
to
regulate
the
agency
fee.
this
is
perfectly
constitutional.
this
is
the
kind
of--
mr.
john
m.
west
--it's
not--
mr.
john
m.
west
--no,
it's
not.
it's
a
different
case
for
two
reasons,
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
because
it's
content
discriminatory.
it's
not
saying
the...
it's
not
saying
you...
we
limit
the
agency
fee
to
the
nonchargeable,
the
non-germane,
or
to
the
purposes
that
are
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
the
state
can
permissibly
do
that
because
it's
making--
mr.
john
m.
west
--the
purposes
that...
the
purposes
for
which
the...
that
are
being
excluded
in
that
case
are
a
wide
variety
of
different
kinds
of
speech
and
non-speech
activities,
not
only
political
speech
but
public
relations.
many
courts
have
interpreted
organizing
activities
to
be
non-germane
to
collective
bargaining.
membership
benefits
that
are
not
available,
non-members
are
put
in
that
category.
donations
to
charities.
international
activities.
there's
a
whole
variety
of
union
expenditures
that
the
courts
have
held
are
not
germane
to
collective
bargaining
and
cannot
be
charged
over
a
non-member's
objection,
and
a
state
would
be
perfectly
free,
as
several
states
like
pennsylvania
and
new
mexico
have,
to
say
our
judgment
is
that
our
interest
in
labor
peace
does
not
extend
further
than
in
authorizing
an
agency
fee
that
includes
purposes
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
john
m.
west
correct.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
there
are
two
problems.
there's
the
concept...
i
mean,
there's--
mr.
john
m.
west
--the
lower
court,
no,
did
not
discuss
the--
mr.
john
m.
west
--what
the
washington
supreme
court
held
is
that
the...
what
was
argued
in
the
washington
supreme
court
generally
is
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
union's
right
to
engage
in
political
advocacy.
mr.
john
m.
west
and
the
reason...
this
is
a
reason
i
think
the
washington
supreme
court
took
note
of
the
fact
of
what
the
funds
were
spent
on,
on
balloting
initiatives
solely,
not
on
candidate
elections.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
the
two
reasons
why
the
statute
fails
to
constitute
a
compelling
government
interest
are
the
overbroad
extension
to
ballot
propositions,
unlike
the
federal
law
and
any
other
state
law.
and
secondly,
the
underinclusiveness
that
this
is
a
statute
that
is
ostensibly
intended
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
elections
by
ensuring
that
the
funds
that
organizations
spend
for
political
electoral
purposes
represent
the
views
of
the
people
from
whom
those
funds
were
derived.
and
the...
what
the
state
has
chosen
to
regulate
to
advance
that
interest
is
solely
people
who
already
have
the
opportunity
to
prevent
the
use
of
their
funds
for
purposes
they
disagree
with,
while
not
regulating
at
all
other
entities
in
which--
mr.
john
m.
west
--i
think
that
would
be
a
valid
argument
if
we
were
attempting
to
raise
an
equal
protection
claim
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
not
what
we're
doing.
what
we're
saying,
we
are
making
an
argument
based
on
what
the
state
supreme
court
held,
namely
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the...
the
union's
right
to
engage
in
political
speech,
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
it.
granted,
that
particular
justification
for
the
ruling
was
not
argued
below,
but
this
is
not
like
we
were
attempting
to
argue
equal
protection,
a
totally
new
basis.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
it
is,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the...
this
is
why
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
so
important.
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
elections
by
ensuring
that
what
organizations
spend
for
political
purposes
represents
the
views
of
those
who
contributed
the
money,
then
it's
very
much
to
the
point
that
there
are
other
organizations.
for
example,
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce--
mr.
john
m.
west
--absolutely...
absolutely
not,
justice
kennedy.
we
recognize--
mr.
john
m.
west
--absolutely
not.
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
but
that's
certainly
not
what
i
intend
to
be
saying.
we
recognize
that
the
non-members
have
first
amendment
rights.
we
also
recognize
that
those
rights
are
protected
by
the
hudson
procedures
which
the
union
uses.
the
non-members
have
the
absolute
right
to
prevent
the
use
of
their
funds
not
only
for
this
kind
of
electoral
speech
but
for
any
kind
of
political
ideological
speech
and
other
nonchargeable
activities
with
which
they
disagree
simply
by
sending
in
a
letter.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
it's
not
that
a
right
is
waived.
what
it
is--
mr.
john
m.
west
--no.
it's...
justice
stevens,
it's
what
the
right
is.
the
constitutional
right
is
a
right
against
being
required
to...
to
engage
in
compelled
speech.
mr.
john
m.
west
no,
you
have
the...
but
that
would
be
just
like...
like
the
solicitor
general
on
the...
the
license
plate
case.
someone
who
receives
in
the
mail
the
license
plate
that
says
"live
free
or
die"
or
"taxation
without
representation"
and
puts
it
on
his
car
is
not
waiving
a
constitutional
right
by--
mr.
john
m.
west
--these
are
teachers
who
have
not
joined
the
washington
education--
mr.
john
m.
west
--i
absolutely
disagree
with
you,
justice
alito,
because
keep
in
mind--
mr.
john
m.
west
--it's
not
asking
them
to
make
a
contribution.
it's
asking
them,
is
it
okay
with
you
if
your
money
is
used
for
this
purpose.
but
keep
in
mind
what
the
money
is
being
used
for
here.
mr.
john
m.
west
the
money
is
being
used--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
whether
there
is
a
difference
or
not,
justice
alito,
the
point
is
the
union
here
is
using
this
money
for
purposes
that
it
has
every
reason
to
believe
is
in
the
interest
of
the
vast
majority
of
teachers,
including--
mr.
john
m.
west
--no,
but
i'm
responding
to
the
suggestion
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
presumption
that
they
would,
would
decline
to
authorize
this.
that's...
the
question
you
raised,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
exactly
the
question
before
the
court,
whether
the
state
can,
constitutionally
can
insist
that
the
union
obtain
affirmative
authorization
for
this
particular
type
of
speech
and
for
no
other
type
of
speech.
let
me...
let
me
suggest--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
maybe
mr....
justice
alito,
if
you
knew
that
what
the
union
was
spending
its
money
for
was
to
improve,
to
increase
cost
of
living
adjustments
for
teachers
or
to
reduce
class
size
for
teachers,
or
to
enact
tax
levies
in
local
school
districts--
mr.
john
m.
west
--no.
justice
ginsburg,
there's
a
lot
of
speculation
on
both
sides.
i
don't
think
there's
any
empirical
evidence,
but
there
is
plenty
of
reason
to
think
that
there
are
many
reasons
that
people
choose
not
to
join
the
union,
whether
from
a
free
rider
motivation,
whether
from
just
not
being
a
joiner,
any
variety
of
reasons.
some
of
them
may
be--
mr.
john
m.
west
--yeah.
mr.
john
m.
west
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
can
compel
us
to,
to
obtain
that
authorization
for
this
limited
type
of
speech.
mr.
john
m.
west
it
doesn't
change
everything,
justice
scalia,
precisely
for
the
reasons
that
you
discussed
in
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
rav
versus
st.
paul,
the
st.
paul
cross-burning
case,
where
you
pointed
out
that,
that
the
greater
includes
the
lesser
argument
does
not
apply
where
you
have
content
discrimination.
the
state
could
justifiably
ban
all
symbols
and
displays
that
involve
fighting
words,
but
it
could
not
single
out
a
particular--
mr.
john
m.
west
--justice
scalia,
imagine,
if
i
may
take
a
little
bit
starker
example,
imagine
that
what
the
government
said
in
the
statute
that
the
union
must
obtain
affirmative
authorization
if
it
is
going
to
use
agency
fee
funds
to
support
democratic
candidates,
but
not
if
it's
going
to
support
republican
candidates.
obviously
it
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
john
m.
west
and
that...
it
goes
further
than
this.
that's
viewpoint
discrimination.
but
this
is
content
discrimination
and
the
court
has
held
in
consolidated
edison
and
a
number
of
other
cases
that
that
is
also
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
john
m.
west
exactly.
mr.
john
m.
west
exactly.
mr.
john
m.
west
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
them
to
consider.
i
also
think
it's
a
matter
that
when
we
get
to
that
point
at
least--
mr.
john
m.
west
--perhaps,
but
it's
certainly
true
that
on
this,
at
least
on
this
point
of
the
lack
of
any
compelling
justification
for
restricting
entities'
contributions
and
expenditures
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
ballot
propositions,
the
law,
this
court's
law,
is
fully
clearly
on
that
point.
it's
our
submission,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
what
you
have
here
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
wea's
ability
to
engage
in
political
speech
on
issues
of
educational
policy
that
are
of
vital
importance
to
the
70,000
teachers
that
it
represents.
mr.
john
m.
west
yes.
if
this
were...
particularly
if
this
were--
mr.
john
m.
west
--certainly
if
this
were
done
in
the
statute
that
authorized
the
agency
fee
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
m.
west
if
it's
done
in
this
statute,
the
problem
that
would
remain,
justice
kennedy,
is
this
is
an
election
law
that
presumably
has
to
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
promotes
the
integrity
of
elections.
and
when
you
have--
mr.
john
m.
west
--the
state
could
do
that,
at
least
if
it
limited
it
to
the
public
sector,
where
the
state
has
the
authority
to
authorize
the
amount
of
the
agency
fee.
i
believe
the
state
could
do
that.
the
state
could
certainly...
some
people
have
talked
about
the
size
of
the
hudson
notice.
the
state
could
impose
requirements
that
the
notice
be
clearer,
that
it
be
shorter.
the
state
could
impose
that
affirmative
authorization
requirement.
the
state
could
limit
the--
mr.
john
m.
west
--well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem,
too.
and
that's--
mr.
john
m.
west
--that
would
be
viewpoint
discriminatory,
but
here
we
have
a
legislative
statute
that,
that
it's
content
discriminatory,
that
can't
be
justified
as
a
compelling
state
interest
to
promote
the
integrity
of
the
elections,
and
we
believe
the
judgment
of
the
washington
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
