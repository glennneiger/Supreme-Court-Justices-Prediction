well,
how
can
the
state
supreme
court
determine
what
is
the
purpose,
the
intent,
of
the
ballot
initiative?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
lot
of
people
voted
for
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
the
state
supreme
court
in
a
position
to
determine
why
they
voted
for
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
they
know
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
this
money
is
the
non-union
member's
money
and
an
opt-out...
i'm
sorry...
opt-in
scheme
is
not
much
of
a
burden
on
the
unions,
why
should
the
first
amendment
permit
anything
other
than
an
opt-in
scheme.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
union
can
make
it
as
difficult
as
it
wants
for
somebody
to
opt
out.
they
can
send
a
packet
that's
this
thick
and
not
provide
a
form.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
exactly
the
same
situation.
these
are
teachers
who
have
chosen
not
to
join
the
washington
education
association;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
overwhelmingly
likely
that
they,
if
you
spoke
to
them
and
you
said
would
you
like
to
give
money
to
the
union
to
spend
on
elections,
they
would
say
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
explain
to
me
the
thinking
of
somebody
who
chooses
not
to
join,
the
5
percent
who
choose
not
to
join,
and
yet
they
would
like
to
make
this
contribution.
now
maybe
there's
some,
but
what
would
be
the
thinking
of
such
a
person?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
saying
would
you
like
to
make
a
contribution,
and
would
you
like
to
allow
us
to
use
money
that
we
possess
for
our
purposes
rather
than
returning
it
to
us?
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
the
thinking
of
these
hypothetical
people.
if
i'm
a
union
member,
i
get
various
benefits.
if
i
choose
not
to
be
a
union
member,
i
don't
get
those
benefits.
why
would
i
choose
to
give
up
the
benefits
of
union
membership
and
yet
want
to
allow
the
union
to
spend
my
money
for
its
political
purposes?
