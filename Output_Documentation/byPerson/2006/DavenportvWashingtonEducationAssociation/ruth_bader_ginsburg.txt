is
it
relevant,
general
clement,
that
the
legislature
didn't
seem
to
be,
or
the
ballot
initiative
didn't
seem
to
be
focused
at
all
on
beefing
up
the
rights
of
the
non-member
of
the
union?
it
seemed
to
be
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
the
election
process,
because
they
left
the
same
old
hudson
in
place
for
union
nongermane
spending
that
didn't
have
to
do
with
elections.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's,
under--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
the
federal
law
you
can't
even
have
this
opt-in
system.
you
have
to
have
a
separate
organization
as
i
understand,
for
the
election.
so
there
would
be
no,
no
possibility
that
the
nonmember
of
the
union,
that
funds
would
go
to
election
financing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
much
harder
on
the
union,
i
would
think,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
which...
on
what
you
were
arguing,
you
were
very
careful
in
your
brief
to
say
funds
lawfully
possessed
by
the
union,
as
distinguished
from
what's
in
a
corporate
treasury
or...
there
is
something
peculiar
about
this,
and
you
recognized
it
by
saying
we
possess
them,
because
if
the
non-member
wants
it
back,
the
non-member
would
be
entitled.
so
it's
not
like
money
in
the
corporate
till.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
all
hypothetical,
mr.
west,
or
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
about
what
the
people
who
are
non-union
members,
if
they
had
their
druthers,
would
they
say
not
a
penny
more
goes
into
the
union
till
than
we
are
forced
to
put
there?
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
that
divides
up
the
universe
of
people
who
don't,
deliberately
don't
join
unions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
of
washington
seems
to
think
that's
fine
for
everything
other
than
election
expenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
content
means
a
category
of
speech
as
opposed
to
what
is
the
political
position
you're
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
that
was
content.
you
could
do
it,
say,
in
the
press,
but
you
couldn't
do
it
over
the
air.
