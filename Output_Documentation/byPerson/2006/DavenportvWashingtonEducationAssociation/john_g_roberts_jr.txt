chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-1589,
davenport
versus
washington
education
association,
and
05-1657
consolidated,
washington
versus
washington
education
association.

chief

john
g.
roberts,

thank
you,

g.

thank
you,
general.
mr.
west.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
thought
that
approach
was
exactly
what
we
held
was
required
in
the
street
decision,
the
international
association
of
machinists
versus
street,
so
that
you
can't
get
around
this
requirement
by
saying,
oh
well,
we'll
use
the
objectors'
funds
for
collective
bargaining
and
we'll
use
the
others
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
that
objection
apply
whether
it's
opt
in
or
opt
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
that
a
content-based
restriction?
you've
got
to
look
at
it
and
see
if
it's
germane.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
argument
that
the
state
supreme
court
in
footnote
6
expressly
said
you
did
not
raise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
surely,
they
get
to
make
that
decision,
don't
they?
under
the
statute,
it's
their
decision
whether
or
not...
you
don't
get
to
say,
well,
this
is
in
your
interests,
or
whether
you'd
want
to
spend
the
money
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
free
under
this
system
to
send
them
the
same
sort
of
materials
you
send
about
your
pac
and
say
we
do
all
sorts
of
good
things
with
the
money
from
people
who
opt
in,
you
should
opt
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
want
to
do
it
without
giving
them
that
opportunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
west.
general
mckenna,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
do
you
see
an
underlying
constitutional
problem
as
to
non-election
expenditures
that
are
still
political
expenditures?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
didn't
we
take
one
in
abood?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
didn't
we
take
a
position
in
abood?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
way
the
statute
works,
you
have
to
opt
in
for
the
election
expenditures,
but
you
have
to
have
a
right
to
opt
out
for
other
non-germane.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
content?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
say
which
way
you're
trying
to
influence
the
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
case
number
05-1589
davenport
versus
washington
educational
association
and
the
consolidated
case
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
