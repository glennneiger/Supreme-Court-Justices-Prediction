mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
at
issue
here
imposes
only
a
narrow
limitation
on
the
union's
use
of
agency
fees,
namely
by
requiring
the
affirmative
assent
of
the
non-members
before
the
union
may
use
those
funds
for
non-germane
political
expenditures.
the
statute
does
not
limit
the
union's
ability
to
spend
its
own
money
on
political
causes
and
every
avenue
that
is
available
to
any
other
organization
in
the
state
to
solicit
contributions
from
non-members
remains
available
to
the
union.
the
court
below
nonetheless
struck
the
statute
down
only
by
treating
the
workers'
minimum
constitutional
rights
as
a
constitutional
ceiling
as
well
as
a
floor.
in
the
process,
the
court
below
rigidly
constitutionalized
an
area
of
labor
law
in
which
the
states
and
the
federal
government
have
at
least
since
the
lochner
era
enjoyed
substantial
discretion
to
make
labor
policy.
we
would
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
below,
but
also
reverse
and
restore
room
for
play
in
the
joints
in
this
area
of
labor
law.
i
think
the
starting
problem
with
the
court's
analysis
below
is
that
the
rights
that
are
at
issue
in
this
area
principally
are
the
rights
of
the
individual
workers.
this
court
has
recognized
that
agency
shop
itself
raises
significant
first
amendment
issues
and
first
amendment
impingements
and
so
the
forced
extraction
of
fees
is
justified
only
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
justified
by
the
government's
interest
in
maintaining
labor
peace
or
in
avoiding
free
ridership.
so
as
a
minimum
constitutional
matter,
the
workers
have
to
have
an
opt-out
right.
the
question
is
whether
the
states
can
go
further
and
either
do
an
opt-in
regime
or
do
what
was
at
issue
in
the
hudson
case
and
not
even
allow
the
union
to
collect
the
non-germane
funds
in
the
first
place
from
non-members.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
might
well.
i
mean,
i
think
there
might
be
an
argument
at
that
point
that
somehow
the
federal
constitution
requires
more
than
opt-out
rights.
certainly
some
of
the
amici
have
made
that
argument.
the
davenport
petitioners
have
made
that
argument,
and
i
suppose
you
could
at
that
point
confront
a
second
petition
in
this
case.
but
at
least
as
a
starting
matter,
i
think
that's
an
option
that's
available
to
the
washington
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
though
i
mean...
i
don't
mean
to
be
able
to
constrain
the
washington
supreme
court's
ability
to
find
a
state
constitutional
problem
that
it
would
then
think
there's
a
need
to
avoid.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
are
elected.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
might
be
a
harder
call,
justice
scalia.
i
seem
to
recall
a
reference...
it
might
have
actually
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
rather
than
in
the
state
supreme
court
opinion...
that
as
a
general
matter
the
washington
courts
have
not
construed
their
first
amendment,
state
constituent
first
amendment
to
be
radically
different
than
the
federal
constitution.
so
i
would
imagine
there's
going
to
be
some
state
law
that
may
limit
their
ability
to
do
that.
i'm
certainly
not
an
expert
on
the
washington
state
law
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
it's
a
fair
question.
as
i
say,
it's
a
question
that's
certainly
raised
by
the
davenport
petitioners.
i
think
there's
an
answer
to
it
and
i'll
get
to
it
in
a
minute.
but
i
would
say
in
fairness
to
mr....
one
of
the
anomalies
of
this
case
is
that
in
many
respects
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
constitutional
question
than
the
one
that
the
washington
supreme
court
answered
adversely
to
petitioners
in
this
case.
i
think,
if
i
can
sketch
an
answer
as
to
why
it
is
that
the
opt
out
is
the
constitutional
minimum
and
there
isn't
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
required
to
be
an
opt-in
right,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
what
the
court
has
construed
as
the
relevant
first
amendment
interest
here.
and
the
court
has
seemingly
construed
the
relevant
first
amendment
interest
here
in
not
having
a
compelled
extraction,
and
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
constitutional
violation,
it
seems
to
have
assumed
there's
a
need
for
a
stated
objection.
and
i
think
that's
where
you
get
the
opt-out
right.
and
so
if
you
put
it
in
the
analogy,
an
analogous
compelled
speech
context
like
willie
against
maynard
and
the
new
hampshire
license
plate,
in
that
context
an
important
parcel
of
the
violation
is
the
objection
to
having
"live
free
or
die"
on
your
license
plate.
and
the
court
hasn't
construed
the
compelled
speech
there
to
be
that
everybody
has
a
compelled
speech
violation
because
they
are
presumptively
forced
to
have
the
license
plate
on
the
back
of
their
car.
so
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
wouldn't
think
so,
justice
alito.
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
separate
questions,
i
would
think.
one
is,
what
is
an
adequate
set
of
procedures
and
protections
for
exercising
the
opt-out
right?
and
then
a
separate
question
would
be,
do
you
actually
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
an
opt-in
right?
and
i
think
that
there
may
well
be
many
cases
where
the
hudson
notice
that's
provided
doesn't
provide
a
sufficient
constitutional
opportunity.
i
mean,
you
have
in
a
case
like
this,
a
100-page
packet,
i'm
told,
that
has
no...
no
form
in
it
that
you're
supposed
to
return
to
opt
out.
you
basically
have
to
go
to
the
third
page,
find
the
address
of
the
president
of
the
union,
and
then
send
in
a
letter.
and
i
think
it's
instructive
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
think
it's
at
page
joint
appendix
45,
you
have
the
form
that's
available
to
union
members
to
opt
in
to
pac
contributions,
and
have
payroll
deductions
made
for
the
pac
contributions.
the
union
certainly
makes
it
much
easier
to
opt
in
to
pac
contributions
than
it
makes
it
to
opt
out
vis
a
vis
the
hudson
packet.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
the
way
we
look
at
it
is
that
this
whole
debate
about
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
a
little
bit
of
a
red
herring,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
it's
clearly
a
hybrid.
if
you
look
at
the
text,
it's
hard
to
understand
how
it
does
not
have
at
least
the
effect
of
protecting
workers.
on
the
other
hand,
you're
absolutely
right
that
it
doesn't
address
the
entirety
of
germane,
of
non-germane
expenses.
it
addressed
a
subset
that
have
the
most
direct
impact
on
the
election
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
true.
that's
true,
i
mean,
for
example,
a
nongermane
lobbying
expense
which
you
might
consider
to
be
political
in
some
broad
sense,
is
not
covered
by
the
opt-in
and
remains
subject
to
the
hudson
opt
out
right.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
certainly
anything
problematic
about
that.
it's
not
like
the
interest
in
protecting
electoral
integrity
is
some
sort
of
forbidden
government
interest
that
makes
this
a
suspicious
piece
of
legislation.
and
i
think
at
the
end,
if
you
again
put
the
text
of
the
relevant
provision
together
with
the
overall
purpose,
it's
clear
that
it's
trying
to
protect
the
rights
of
workers
but
it's
doing
so
in
service
of
a
broader
intent
of
improving
electoral
integrity,
and
i
could
suggest
where
maybe
the
washington
supreme
court
went
awry
in
its
analysis,
it
focused
almost
exclusively
on
the
three
stated
purposes
that
were
included
in
the
text
of
initiative
134,
which
were
all
focused
more
on
electoral
integrity.
that's
not
surprising,
because
there
were
36
sections
in
initiative
134
that
dealt
with
the
whole
manner
of
different
campaign
finance
initiatives.
before
this
initiative
was
passed
by
the
voters
of
washington
there
weren't
any
campaign
contribution
limits
in
the
state
of
washington.
so
this
initiative
is
doing
a
lot
more
work,
just
besides
section
760.
i
think
760
isn't
unrelated
to
those
broader
purposes
because
it
does
make
sure
that
the
contributions
of
the
workers
here
are
voluntary,
and
i
think
that
is
certainly
something
that's
very
similar
to
what
federal
law
accomplishes
through
the
separate
segregated
fund
requirements.
if
i
could
make
just
one
note
about
the
fact
that
this
targets
unions
and
not
other
entities,
i
think
two
points
are
relevant.
the
first
is
that
argument
was
very
clearly
waived,
and
if
you
look
at
footnote
6
of
the
washington
supreme
court
opinion
which
is
at
25a
of
the...
of
the
state's
petition
appendix,
it's
clear
that
any
argument
about
the,
the
disparate
treatment
of
unions
versus
corporations
or
other
entities
was
not
before
that
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you've
anticipated
my
second
point,
which
is
the
power
that's
being...
i
mean,
it's
no
accident
that
they
targeted
this
particular
power
or
this
particular
issue
because
it
has
always
been
understood
to
be
an
anomaly
in
this
area.
that
the
unions
have
a
right
to
effectively
take
a
claim
on
the
paycheck
on
people
who
are
nonmembers
of
the
union.
these
are
individuals
who
have
already
opted
out
of
union
membership,
and
that
is
a
sufficient
anomaly
and
sufficiently
unlike
any
other
context
that
i
think
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
the
state
of
washington
from
targeting
that
problem
and
that
problem
alone.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
