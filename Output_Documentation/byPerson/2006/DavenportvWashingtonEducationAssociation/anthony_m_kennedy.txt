justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
wanted
to
ask
about
that.
suppose
washington
says
that
as
a
matter
of
washington
law
we
are
bound
by
our
interpretation
of
purpose
and
we
interpret
the
statute
according
to
that
purpose.
you
use
the
words
"plain
language"
a
few
minutes
ago.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
we
free
to
disregard
that
and
to
say.
oh
well,
we're
just
going
to
follow
the
plain
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
like
the
says
that
was
argued,
the
first
case
this
morning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
a
federal,
a
federal
statute
and
this
is
a
state
statute.
if
the
state
court
says,
we're
interested
in
purposes,
we
decided,
and
you
must
as
a
matter
of
state
law
interpret
the
statute
according
to
the
purpose
as
we
found
it,
aren't
we
bound
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
the
characterization
had
a
federal
consequence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
the
court's
conclusion
that
constitutionality
is
at
issue
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
your
position
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
either
way
you
interpret
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
washington...
at
a
minimum,
i
would
assume
that
the
washington
supreme
court
would
not
have
constitutional
avoidance
as
a
crutch
in
order
to
reach
that,
to
reach
that
conclusion,
because
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
here
under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
union
members,
of
the
workers
who
are
non-union
members
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you...
you
begin
by
talking
about
the
first
amendment
but
you,
you
proceed
as
if
there
are
no
first
amendment
rights
of,
of
workers
involved
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
states
have
considerable
discretion
in
determining
how
to
protect
federal
constitutional
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
absent
some
direction
that
we
have
to
consider
this
as
only
being
for
a,
for
purposes
of
election
transparency,
it
seems
to
me
that
washington
acted
quite
properly
in
saying
we
will
use
this
mechanism
in
order
to
protect
our
workers'
first
amendment
constitutional
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
consider
this
case
as
if
the
first
amendment
rights
of
non-union
members
were
not
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
been
your
whole
argument
so
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
have
a
restriction
requiring
affirmative
authorization
for
all
union
expenditures
that
fall
within
the
abood-machinist
line
of
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
were
across
the
board
as
to
all
first
amendment
rights
an
objecting
member
has,
then
the
statute
would
be
void...
would
be
valid,
rather?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it's
done
in
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
hypothetical
is
that
there's
a
washington
statute
or
a
washington
constitutional
referendum
provision,
initiative
provision,
which
says
that
as
to
all
protected
speech
for
non-union
members
who
have
moneys
taken
out,
there
must
be
affirmative
authorization.
