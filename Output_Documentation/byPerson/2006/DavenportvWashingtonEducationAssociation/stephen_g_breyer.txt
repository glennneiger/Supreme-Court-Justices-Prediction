justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
what
they
intended,
then
how
can
a
state
say,
well,
it's
the
union's
money,
we
don't
want
you
to
send
this
little
bit
of
your
money
to
contribute
in
a
campaign,
but
if
the
local
swimming
team
wants
to,
or
the
bar
association
or
the
corporation,
if
they
want
to
spend
money
that
people
have
given
them
for
totally
other
purposes,
the
compulsory
bar
association,
well,
they
can
do
that.
it's
just
the
labor
unions
that
can't
spend
the
money
that
these
people
forced
to
belong...
you
know,
they
have
to
object
affirmatively...
but
all
the
other
similar
organizations,
they
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
now
you're
talking
about
this
other
purpose,
but
that
other
purpose,
which
is
rather
interesting...
i
take
it
that's
one
of
the
main
points
on
the
other
side...
the
other
purpose
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
if
washington
wanted
to
have
a
similar
statute
where
it
was
worried
about
protecting
the
interests
of
the
compelled
member
or
the
compelled
payor,
fine,
fine,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case
they
couldn't
care
less
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
in
that
case,
in
that
case
they
didn't
have
a
state
supreme
court
interpreting
the
statute
which
is
just
as
you
started
off
saying
it
was,
which
has
nothing
to
with
the
rights
of
the
nonmember,
zero.
it
has
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
fairness
in
the
election.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
get
their
money
back?
if
this
is
upheld
and
i'm
an
agency
member,
i
hate
the
union,
can't
stand
it,
gave
them
the
$20
for
this
and
they
spent
it
on
a
political
candidate
i
hate
even
more
and
you
win,
do
i
get
my
$20
back
or
can
the
union
just
spend
my
$20
on
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
question
is
this
the
union's
money
or
is
this
the
workers',
the
teachers'
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
does
he
get
this
money
back
if
they
violate
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
curious
below
in
the
opinion,
i
didn't
notice
in
footnote
6,
which
i
hadn't
taken
in,
that
the
court
explicitly
says
that
you
did
not
make
any
argument
about
underinclusiveness
and
overinclusiveness
with
respect
to
other
organizations,
corporations
and
so
forth.
now,
did...
i
can't
recall,
i
just
don't
recall.
what
you're
saying
now,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
word
"election",
you
can't
use
it
for
elections,
and
elections
involve
candidates
and
they
also
involve
ballot
issues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
that
the
real
problem
with
this
statute
is
that
it
throws
in
ballot
issues
along
with
candidate
elections.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
on
that
first
one,
did
they
discuss
that
at
some
length
in
the
lower
court
opinion?
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
this
is
really
a
ground
that
they
haven't
considered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
thing
about
the
ballot
issue
is
not
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
fact,
you
want
to
us
decide
that
question,
and
was
there
another
one
that...
you
just
said
there
were
two
reasons
basically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
see
that
you've
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
this
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
saying
right
now,
if
it
is,
is
ballots
versus
candidates
under
the
word
"election".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
has
a
lot
of
implications
for
all
kinds
of
campaign
finance
law
that
has
nothing
to
do,
i
think,
with
unions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
lower
court
didn't
consider
it,
and
is
this
open
now,
if
it's
going
back
for
other
things
such
as
the
state
constitution,
for
them
to
consider
this
matter
on
remand?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
know,
perhaps
you
don't
know,
what
the
implication
of
a
decision
say
in
your
favor
here
would
have
for
vermont's
campaign
finance
law
or
california's
or
some
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
yes,
then
the
category
here
is
election
speech.
if
you're
going
to
call
a
statute
that
treats
election
speech
especially,
then
all
of
campaign
finance
regulation
would
fall
in
that
category.
and
if
you're
going
to
use
that
distinction
to
say
strict
scrutiny
applies,
then
strict
scrutiny
would
apply
to
all
campaign
finance
regulation.
and
courts
never
to
my
knowledge
apply
strict
scrutiny
to
campaign
finance
regulation
because
there
are
speech
interests
on
both
sides
of
the
equation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
glad
you
said
yes
to
me
because
that
implies
a
no
to
the
last
question.
[laughter]
