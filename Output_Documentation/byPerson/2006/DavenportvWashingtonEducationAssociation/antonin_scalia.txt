justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
surprised
that
that's
the...
i
would
have
thought
its
primary
purpose
would
be
to
spare
individuals
the
necessity
of
supporting
causes
that
they
don't
support.
was
there
no
first
amendment
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
only
an
election
law
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
just
said
the
state
supreme
court
was
wrong.
i
mean,
why
do
you
believe
it
on
this
if
you
don't
believe
it
on
everything
else?
you're
appealing
from
it,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
let,
let's
assume
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
at
least
in
part
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
non-union
members
or
whether,
as
the
washington
supreme
court
seemed
to
say...
at
least
they
said
its
principal
purpose
was
to
protect
the
voting
process.
elsewhere
in
its
opinion,
however,
the
washington
supreme
court
says
where
a
statute
is
ambiguous
and
this
court
is
able
to
construe
it
in
a
manner
which
renders
it
constitutional
the
court
is
obliged
to
do
so,
which
sounds
to
me
like
good
law.
wouldn't
that
apply
to
its
intuition
as
to
what
the--
intent
of
the
people
who
enacted
this
statute
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
the
washington
supreme
court
be
obliged
to
intuit
that
purpose
which
would
make
it
constitutional
rather
than
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
courts
in
washington
state
elected,
do
we
know
that?
are
they
elected?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
elected,
so
it's
easier
to
blame
it
on
us
than
it
is
for
them
to
say,
we
hold
as
a
matter
of
washington
law
that
this
can't
be
done
and
we
disallow
what
the
people
have
voted
for.
that
would
be
harder,
a
harder
call,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
nongermane
political
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
are
there
any
other
such
entities
that
are
given
the
power
by
the
state
to
collect
money
from
people
against
their
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
content
discrimination
which
subjects
legislation
to
strict
scrutiny
if
the
government,
federal
government
or
a
state
designates
certain
funds
for
use
by
school
districts
to
teach
patriotism,
american
history,
something
like
that?
is
that
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now
let's
assume
it's
not
government
funding.
instead
of
doing
that
the
government
says,
you
will
have
authority
to
collect
money
from
certain
people
only
for
a
particular
purpose.
is
that
content
discrimination
which
calls
into
play
strict
scrutiny?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
the
one
is
any
worse
than
the
other.
the
government
has
a
particular
purpose
in
mind
and
in
one
case
it
gives
out
money
with
that
purpose
in
mind,
which
discriminates
of
course;
in
the
other
case
it
allows
this
extraordinary
power
to
exact
funds
from
people,
but
only
for
certain
purposes.
that's
not
the
kind
of
content
discrimination
that
they
calls
strict
scrutiny
into
play,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
is
the
government
acting
as
a
coercer.
it's
because
of
the
government
that
you're
allowed
to
get
this
money
from
these
non-union
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
no
longer
exists
if
you
don't
make
a
timely
objection.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
the
state
has
given
you
the
power
to
exact
the
money
from
these
people.
that
changes
everything.
if
this
was
money
that
they
had
contributed
themselves,
you'd
have
a
different
argument,
but
the
state
compels
them
to
give
you
that
money
and
the
state
says
however,
you
will
not
use
this
money
for
this
purpose
without
their
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
brings
us
back
to
the
question
i
asked
earlier
and
i
suggested
in
my
answer
to
that
i
don't
think
it's
content
discrimination
of
the
sort
that
triggers
strict
scrutiny
when
the
government
gives
money
for
a
particular
purpose
only
and
not
for
other
purposes,
and
i
also
don't
think
it's
content
discrimination
of
the
sort
that
triggers
strict
scrutiny
when
the
government
allows
a
private
organization
to
use
governmental
power
to
exact
money
from
people
for
a
particular
purpose
only.
that's
a
different
ball
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
my
understanding,
too.
i
think
you
got
to
get
out
of
it
some
other
way.
i
mean,
you've
got
to
say
it's
content
but
it
doesn't
apply
when
it's
the
government
contributing
money
or
it
doesn't
apply
when
you're
applying
it
to
money
that's
being
coerced
by
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
get
to
the
point
you
were
about
to
make,
what
the
purpose
of
the
thing
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
many
states
authorized
government
employee
unions
to
negotiate
so
called
“agency-shop
agreements”
which
entitled
the
unions
to
levy
fees
on
employees
who
are
not
union
members
but
whom
the
unions
represent
in
collective
bargaining.
in
essence,
as
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
government
agency
agrees
not
to
hire
employees
who
do
not
join
the
union
unless
they
contribute
part
of
their
salary
to
the
union.
in
a
series
of
cases
however
this
court
is
held
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
government
employee
unions
from
using
these
government
compelled
contributions
for
ideological
purposes
irrelevant
to
collective
bargaining
if
the
non-member
objects
and
that
the
unions
must
observe
various
procedural
safeguards
to
insure
that
a
non-member
has
the
opportunity
to
object.
the
state
of
washington
has
chosen
to
authorize
its
government
employee
unions
to
enter
into
these
agency-shop
agreements
but
it
has
imposed
an
additional
obligation
on
all
agency-shop
unions,
government
and
non-government.
an
initiative
passed
by
the
voters
of
washington
which
i
will
refer
to
as
section
760,
requires
unions
to
obtain
the
non-members
affirmative
consent,
if
the
unions
wish
to
use
the
compelled
agency
fees
for
election
related
purposes.
the
respondent
here
is
a
government
employee
union
in
washington
which
was
sued
for
violating
section
760
by
spending
non-members
agency-shop
fees
for
election
related
purposes
without
obtaining
their
authorization.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
held
that
section
760’s
requirement
that
respondent
obtain
the
consent
of
non-member
violated
the
first
amendment
rights
of
responding
union.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
it
is
undisputed
that
washington
could
have
prohibited
government
employee
unions
from
using
agency
fees
for
any
purpose
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining
and
indeed
could
even
have
eliminated
agency
fees
entirely.
we
hold
that
section
760’s
more
modest
restriction
upon
government
employee
union’s
extraordinary
entitlement
to
agency-shop
fees
also
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
thought
that
the
requirements
imposed
on
government
employee
unions
by
our
agency-fee
jurisprudence
represented
a
careful
constitutional
balance
between
the
rights
of
non-members
and
the
rights
of
unions.
so
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
unions
were
violated
by
the
mere
fact
that
760
deviated
from
what
we
have
constitutionally
required,
that
is
by
requiring
unions
to
wait
until
non-members
opt-in
rather
than
until
they
fail
to
opt-out
before
spending
their
fees
on
election
fund
for
election
purposes.
but
our
cases
were
not
balancing
constitutional
rights
in
that
manner
because
as
already
noted
government
employee
unions
have
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
agency-shop
fees
and
the
state
could
always
forbid
them
completely.
states
are
not
prohibited
from
imposing
greater
restrictions
on
government
employee
agency-shop
arrangements
than
what
is
necessary
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
non-members.
taking
a
different
tack
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington
respondent
in
his
argument
before
us
attack
section
760
using
our
campaign
finance
cases
because
section
760
is
after
all
a
restriction
on
how
respondent
can
spend
money
on
electoral
speech
but
those
campaign
finance
cases
are
quite
inapposite.
section
760
as
applied
to
government
employee
unions
such
as
respondent
constitutes
a
condition
placed
on
the
state’s
extraordinary
permission
for
unions
to
exact
payment
as
a
condition
of
government
employment.
where
as
our
campaign
finance
cases
deal
with
governmental
restrictions
on
how
certain
entities
may
spend
their
own
money
that
is
money
obtained
without
government
coercion.
respondent
is
on
firmer
ground
however
in
arguing
that
section
760
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
content-based.
specifically,
that
the
provision
requires
affirmative
authorization
only
for
electoral
speech
while
letting
unions
use
non-members
fees
or
all
other
types
of
speech
without
such
affirmative
authorization.
while
this
argument
has
some
force
we
ultimately
reject
it.
not
all
content-based
regulations
of
speech
are
subject
to
hype
in
first
amendment
scrutiny.
for
example
we
have
repeatedly
recognized
that
content-based
distinctions
are
permissible
when
the
government
is
acting
in
a
capacity
other
that
as
a
regulator
such
as
when
it
subsidies
a
speech
or
when
it
allows
private
speech
on
certain
types
of
government
property.
we
hold
that
the
unique
context
of
government
employee
agency-shop
agreements
is
another
area
where
reasonable
content-based
distinctions
are
allowed.
the
voters
of
washington
were
evidently
concern
that
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
was
being
harmed
by
allowing
unions
to
spend
on
elections
money
that
has
been
extracted
from
non-members
without
their
consent.
they
limited
their
restriction
on
government
employee
unions
state
bestowed
entitlement
accordingly.
the
first
amendment
did
not
compel
them
to
restrict
government
employee
unions’
extraordinary
entitlement
to
non-member
agency
fees
more
broadly
than
necessary
to
vindicate
that
narrow
concern.
finally,
since
respondent
is
a
government
employee
union
and
has
challenged
section
760
only
has
applied
to
itself
we
need
not
consider
and
so
not
consider
in
this
case
the
constitutionality
of
section
760
as
applied
to
private
sector
unions.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito
have
joined.
