mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
washington
law
authorizes
union
security
agreements
which
permit
unions
to
enter
into
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
require
non-member
employees
to
pay
an
agency
shop
fee
or
lose
their
job.
the
union's
authority
to
select
these
compelled
fees
is
based
solely
on
statute
and
the
subject
of
statutory
conditions.
section
760,
as
adopted
by
washington
voters
in
1992,
requires
unions
to
obtain
the
affirmative
consent
from
non-members
before
their
fees
may
be
used
to
influence
an
election
or
operate
a
political
committee.
760
serves
the
state's
interest
in
election
integrity
by
means
of
ensuring
that
union
election
activity
is
funded
by
voluntary
contributions,
just
like
every
other
organization
that
seeks
political
funds.
760
is
a
valid
condition
on
the
union
statutory
authority
and
does
not
violate
the
union's
first
amendment
rights.
760
serves
the
state's
interests
specified
in
the
adopted
initiative,
which
were...
which
are
found
at
petition
appendix
138a
codified
as
rcw
4217.620.
three
interests
in
election
integrity
are
stated,
or
three
means
of
serving
an
interest
in
election
integrity
are
stated
in
this
portion,
the
intent
portion
of
the
statute.
first,
to
ensure
that
individuals
have
a
fair
and
equal
opportunity
to
influence
elections;
second,
to
reduce
the
influence
of
large
organizational
contributors;
third,
to
restore
public
trust
in
the
election
process.
the
washington
supreme
court,
petition
appendix
22a-23a,
agreed
that
the
intent
of
initiative
134
was
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
from
the
perception
that
individuals
have
an
insignificant
role
to
play.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--actually,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
that
section,
section
760
accomplishes
both
purposes.
the
overall
intent
of
the
initiative
was
as
i
stated
found
by
the
state
supreme
court,
but
clearly
from
the
plain
language
of
section
760--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--we
believe
that
the
integrity
of
the
election
process,
justice
scalia,
is
in
fact
served
by
helping
ensure
that
individuals
make
voluntary
contributions.
we
think
that
in
fact
it
does
help
the
integrity
of
the
election
process,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor.
they
referred
to
the--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--right.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
they
simply
hold,
your
honor,
in
their
opinion
that
this
is
what
the
voters
intended.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i
don't
know
how
they
know
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
beginning
with
the
railway
labor
act
case
and
continuing
up
through
the
public
school
teacher
cases,
abood
and
hudson,
this
court
has
recognized
that
compelling
employees
to
pay
fees
must
be
balanced
against
the
need
to
protect
them
from--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--actually,
your
honor,
i
think
the
plain
language
of
760
makes
it
clear
that
the
authors
of
the
initiative
intended
to
protect
individual
interests.
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
use
of
individuals
in
760,
in
section
760,
than
there
is
in
the
hudson,
in
the
hudson
statute,
for
example.
the
hudson
statute,
the
illinois
statute
at
issue
in
hudson,
also
required
nonmembers
to
opt
in
in
order
to
make,
not
just
political
contributions
but
any
contributions.
but
the
court,
this
court,
found
no
problem
with
hudson
or
with
the
illinois
statute
in
that
case.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
with
due
respect
that
was
the
legal
conclusion
of
the
washington
supreme
court.
it
was
not
a
construction
of
the
statute.
it
was
a
legal
conclusion
based
on
their
reading
or
divining
of
voter
intend.
but
this
court
is
not
bound
by
such
an
assessment.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
no.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
as
chief
justice
roberts
mentioned
in
the
last
case
you
heard
this
morning,
first
look
to
the
plain
language,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
in
numerous
briefs--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--i
don't
believe
you
are
bound
by
that,
your
honor.
for
example--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--wisconsin
v.
mitchell,
your
honor.
in
that
case
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
found
by
this
court
not
to
have
constructed
the
statute,
but
to
have
made
an
assessment
of
its
practical
effects,
and
this
court
found
it
was
not
bound.
similarly
in
teller,
a
case
more
directly
relevant
to
this
case,
the
state
supreme
court
found
that
the
bar
association
of
california
is
a
governmental
agency
and
this
court
declined
to
follow
the
state
supreme
court
of
california
and
found
that
in
fact
it
was
not.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
i
simply
observed
that
this
court
did
not
find
it
was
bound
by
the
california
supreme
court's
finding
that
the
bar
association
is
a
government
agency,
nor
did
it
find
in
wisconsin
v.
mitchell
that
it
was
bound
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
regards
to
its
assessment
of
practical
effects
of
the
wisconsin
statute
at
issue
there.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
if
it
is
a
760
expense
they
should
get
the
money
back.
if
it
is
a
non-760
expense
which
is
not
germane,
then
they
would
have
to
opt
out
at
that...
they
would
have
to
opt
out
to
get
that
kind
of
money
back,
unless
your
honor
is
referring
to
what
happens
on,
if
the
statute
is
upheld,
what
happens
when
we
go
back
and
have
a
further
trial
on
the
issues
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
which
scenario
you
were
envisioning,
but--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor,
the
760
money...
excuse
me.
the
760
money
is
not
the
union's
money
until
they
have
satisfied
the
conditions
laid
out
in
the
statute,
in
this
case
section
760.
possession
of
the
fees
does
not
entitle
the
wea
or
any
union
to
use
those
fees
to
influence
an
election
or
operate
a
political
committee
until
after
they
have
satisfied
the
condition
on
that
collection,
the
condition
being
in
this
case
they
have
to
obtain
affirmative
authorization.
this
court
held
in
phillipson
and
brown
that,
analogizing
to
that
money,
that
non-members
own
the
fees
until
the
statutory
conditions
are
satisfied.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
sir--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
if
in
fact
section
760
were
ambiguous.
it
is,
however,
not
ambiguous.
it
is
plain
on
its
face,
and
in
fact
the
supreme
court
did
not
state
that
any
term
or
phrase
in
section
760
is
ambiguous.
instead
they
referred
to
their
divination
of
voter
intent.
and
i
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
with
regard
to
the
union's
first
amendment
rights
is
not
at
issue
here,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
the
further
point
that...
and
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
obvious
point,
but
we
think
that
since
under
your
decisions
the
state
can
prohibit
a
union
from
collecting
an
agency
fee
altogether,
that
it
is
reasonable
for
the
state
to
impose
a
condition
on
that
collection
which
falls,
falls
far
short
of
actually
prohibiting
it.
we
further
point
out
that
in
the
hudson
case
the
illinois
statute
at
issue
was
effectively
an
opt-in
statute,
a
statute
under
which
no
amount
that
was
not
germane
could
be
collected
in
advance,
unlike
the
more
generous
washington
state
statute
which
allows
the
union,
permits
the
union,
to
collect
a
fee
in
an
amount
equal
to
dues
or
would
permit
it
to
collect
a
fee
which
had
been
reduced
in
advance
to
reflect
non-germane
or
reduced
just
to
reflect
760
expenses.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
establish
such
a
condition
in
the
interest
of
an
election's
integrity
by
means
of
protecting
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the
non-members,
and
we
think
the
statute
does
that
very
well
without
imposing
in
fact
a
substantial
administrative
burden
on
the
union
in
this
case
or
unions
in
general.
for
example,
the,
the
way
that
the
wea
or
any
union
can
comply
with
section
760
would
be
to
simply
place
an
additional
form
in
the
hudson
packet
they
send
out.
now,
recognizing
that
the
hudson
packet
is
about
this
thick,
that
it
is
received
by
the
teachers
in
september,
the
busiest
month
of
the
year
for
teachers,
and
that
there
is
no
form
currently
provided
in
that
packet
whatsoever
to
allow
people
to
opt
out,
but
rather
a
statement
that
you
must
send
a
letter
to
the
union
to
opt
out,
we
think
it's
quite
easy.
and
we
look
to
the
wea
pac
for
instruction
on
what
they
could
do.
but
now.
because
the
wea
has
chosen
to
form
a
pac
and
is
required
to
solicit
members
and
non-members
if
they
choose
in
order
to
contribute
to
that
pac,
they
do
a
very
good
job
of
soliciting
members.
they
include
a
very
convenient
form
encouraging
people
to
check
off
and
send
their
dues
in
to
the
pac
to
support
candidate
elections.
they
provide
no
such
form
for
the
opt-out
process,
but
it
would
be
easy
for
them
to
do
so.
the
burden
imposed
on
them
is
not
great
administratively,
as
they
suggest,
any
more
than
the
burden
on
the
other
teachers
unions
in
abood
or
in
hudson
because
it
can
easily
be
met
through
these
simple.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
first
of
all,
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
breyer
concerning
whether
they
get
their
money
back.
i
took
your
question
to
refer
to
a
hypothetical,
but
allow
me
to
address
the
real
circumstances
in
this
case
by
referring
to
the
joint
appendix
at
210-212.
these
are
the
pages
covering
the
permanent
injunction
that
was
entered
by
the
trial
court.
under
that
permanent
injunction,
the
wea
shall
return
to
all
agency
fee
payers
who
have
not
affirmatively
authorized
the
use
of
their
fees
for
expenditures,
and
it
lays
out
the
means
of
doing
that.
for
the
first
2
years
there's
an
agreed-upon
amount.
for
the
next
3
years
of
the
injunction
there's
another
amount.
but
they
do
get
their
money
back
under
that
injunction.
referring
to
the
issue
of
whether
they
waive
or
not,
under
the
current
process
used
by
the
wea,
referring
to
ja-198,
which
is
the
letter
sent
out
on
september
15,
2000,
by
the
wea
to
the
non-members,
you'll
note
the
statement,
quote:
"if
such
written
objection
has
not
been
postmarked
by
october
16,
2000,
you
will
waive
your
ability
to
object.
"
the
state
of
washington's
position
is
that
non-members
should
not
be
required
to
say
no
twice.
they
said
no
when
they
chose
not
to
join
the
union.
the
union's
position
now
is,
well,
we
get
to
use
your
money
for
political
purposes
unless
you
say
no
a
second
time.
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
reasonable
default
position
to
take
and
certainly
we
believe
the
state--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
section
760
the
state
of
washington
does
think
that's
fine
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
section
760,
the
purpose
being
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
elections
by
several
different
means
involving
protecting--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--we
don't
take
a
position
on
whether
there's
a
constitutional
problem
with
regard
to
non-germane
expenditures,
your
honor.
but
we
do
believe--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
what
i
meant
was--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes.
your
honor,
the
chief
justice
is
correct,
of
course.
what
i
thought
the
question
was
about
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
all,
all
non-germane
expenses
must
be
opt-in,
must
be
provided.
that's
all
i
meant.
you're
absolutely
correct.
of
course,
in
your
decisions
opt-out
is
satisfactory,
and
we're
not
saying
that
opt-out
is
not
satisfactory
here
as
far
as
the
state's
position
is
concerned.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
impose
this
additional
requirement
of
affirmative
authorization.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
seem
to
be
viewpoint
discrimination,
and
it
would
implicate--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
that
this
is
content,
content
discrimination.
this
is
content
neutral.
760
establishes
a
procedure,
that
is
to
say
a
requirement
that
must
be
met
before
the
money
may
be
used.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
that
additional
affirmative
authorization
does
apply
to
this
category
of
speech,
influencing
an
election
or
operating
a
political
committee.
but
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
problematic
constitutionally
any
more
than
the
argument
of
taxpayers
with
representations
in
the
reagan
case
was,
where
they
argued
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
tax
deductible
contributions
and
use
them
for
lobbying.
the
court
found
to
the
contrary.
and
indeed,
initiative
134
is
about
protecting
individuals.
it's
about
protecting
individuals
in
section
760.
it
says
in
the
intent
section--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
if
it
is
content
discrimination,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
is
permissible,
yes,
sir.
and
if
it
were
viewpoint...
in
the
hypothetical,
if
there
were
viewpoint
discrimination
that
would
not
implicate
any
constitutional
right
of
the
union,
but
it
may
very
well
implicate
the
southworth
interests
of
the
non-member
fee
payers.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
we
don't
believe
it
is
content-based,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
we
don't
believe
it
is,
because
it's
any
election
of
any
kind.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
that
is
it's
only
in
regard
to
influencing
elections
or
operating
a
political
committee,
which
is
a
second.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
we
believe
that--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
your
question.
[laughter]
and
we
believe
that...
we
believe
of
course
that
section
760
is
not
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
it
is
subject
at
most
to
a
rationale
basis;
and
that
clearly
there
is
a
rationale
basis
for
the
state
in
this
case
to
require
the
affirmative
authorization
of
non-member
fee
payers.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
found
a
purpose
of
the
entire
law,
initiative
134,
to
be
to
protect
election
integrity.
but
760
is
one
means
of
achieving
that
purpose
by
means
of
protecting
individual
interests.
similarly,
section
680
of
this
law,
which,
i
apologize,
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it's
rcw
4217-680,
which
requires
positive
checkoff
before
an
employer
may
deduct
pac
contributions
for
any
employee.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
they
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
