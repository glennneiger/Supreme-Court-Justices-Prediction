mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
defendant,
in
unequivocal
language
of
section
1346,
waives
sovereign
immunity
and
permits
a
refund
suit
by
a
third
party
such
as
petitioner.
that
conclusion
that
i've
stated
to
the
court
was
supported
by
the
holding
in
united
states
versus
williams.
that
case,
as
the
court
well
knows,
dealt
with
a
situation
in
which
the
government
sought
to
recover
money
through
a
tax
lien
as
opposed
to
a
tax
levy,
which
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
however,
there
is
no
substantive
difference
between
the--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--justice
ginsburg,
section
7426
was
not
available
in
the
case
of
mrs.
williams,
but--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--it
was
a
lien
case,
and
of
course,
7426
involves
a
levy.
but
nonetheless,
the
holding
that
i
have
read
in
that
case
very
definitively
deals
with
the
breadth
of
section
1346.
and
the
breadth
of
section
1346,
according
to
the
holding
and
united
states
vs.
williams,
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
third
party
like
petitioner.
i
do
not
view
the
fact
that
7426
was
not
available
to
be
a
controlling
issue
because
the
question
was
whether
or
not
1346
would
permit
a
third
party
to
bring
a
refund
action.
and
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
as
i
read
that
opinion.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
case
of
7426,
congress
never
made
that
remedy
expressly
exclusive.
the
language
is
completely
missing
from
that
statute.
and
the
argument
was
raised
in
united
states
vs.
williams
that
if
section
1346
was
made
available
to
third
parties,
like
mrs.
williams,
it
would
render
meaningless
the
short
statute
of
limitations.
1346
offers
only
post
deprivation
relief.
section
7426
offers
both
pre
and
post
deprivation
relief.
so
the
two
statutes
can
live
in
harmony
and
can
be
harmonized
and
should
not
be
held
to
have
preempt...
one
over
the
other
when
there
is
no
express
declaration
from
congress
making
that
the
case.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that's
been
applied
in
the
tax
code,
but
i
can
answer
your
question,
i
think,
by
saying
this.
congress
on
many
instances
has
made
provisions
of
the
united
states
internal
revenue
code
exclusive.
congress
knows
how
to
write
those
provisions
into
the
tax
code
when
it
wants
to
do
so.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
done.
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
after
the
decision
in
united
states
vs.
williams,
congress
amended
7426
to
add
a
special
provision.
and
in
that
special
provision,
it
was
made
exclusive.
and
i
use
that
to
exemplify
the
fact
that
congress
can,
when
it
wants
to,
make
a
tax
provision
exclusive.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
scalia,
7426
has
four
different
components.
two
of
the
components
are
clearly
pre-deprivation
type
remedies.
they
are
the
ability
of
a
taxpayer
or
third
party
to
seek
an
injunction
to
prohibit
the
government
from
either
selling
property
or
conducting
a
levy.
those
are
clearly
pre-deprivation.
the
other
two
are
primarily
post
deprivation
remedies.
and
so
the
object
that
the
government
was
trying
to
achieve
can
be
achieved
through
looking
at
it
from
a
pre-deprivation/post-deprivation
analysis.
i
don't
believe
that
the
government's
underlying
purpose
is
in
any
way
diminished
when
the
two
statutes
can
live
in
harmony.
and
without
having
an
exclusivity
provision
expressly
stated
in
7426,
and
given
the
fact
that
1346
on
its
face
plainly
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
third
parties
to
bring
refund
suits,
the
two
statutes
must
be
construed--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
petitioner
is
not
challenging
the
underlying
assessment
against
the
taxpayer.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
7426
clearly
prevents
a
person
from
contesting
the
underlying
assessment,
whereas
in
1346,
that
is
possible.
but
in
this
case,
1346
is
broad
enough
because
it
uses
the
term
collected.
and
just
like
in
williams,
we
are
not
seeking
to
contest
the
underlying
assessment.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
stevens,
there
is
certainly...
government
has
demonstrated
by...
or
congress
has
demonstrated
by
passing
7426,
that
there
is
an
interest
in
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations
in
certain
cases.
however,
i
return
to
my
original
argument
that
if
1346
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
third
party
refund
suits,
and
if
congress
has
not
made
7426
exclusive,
the
two
statutes
should
be
allowed
to
coexist.
this
court
has
held
on
other
occasions
that
it
will
not
preempt
statutes
without
a
very
clear
expression
from
congress.
and
congress,
once
again,
knew
how
to
do
it
after
the
williams
case.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
the
whole
amount.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
when
i
read
the
opinion
in
united
states
vs.
williams,
the
nordic
case
was
brought
up
by
the
dissent
in
that
case,
that
there
must
be
an
absolutely
unequivocal
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
order
to
allow
a
particular
suit
against
the
united
states.
the
holding
in
united
states
versus
williams
was
that
1346
was
sufficiently
broad.
and
given
that
holding,
and
given
the
fact
that
the
government
was
asserting
that
mrs.
williams
had
other
remedies
in
the
form
of
a
quiet
title
action,
a
refund
action--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--justice
ginsburg,
there
is
another
remedy,
which
is
certainly
governed
by
a
much
shorter
statute
of
limitations.
but
in
my
view,
the
equities
or
the
facts
of
the
case
should
not
drive
the
construction
of
the
statute,
any
more
than
it
did
in
united
states
versus
williams.
and
if
1346
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
third
party
case
in
the
instance
of
a
lien,
it
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
it
in
the
case
of
a
levy.
there
is
no
functional
substantive
difference
between
money
taken
from
a...
from
a
third
party
via
a
lien
or
via
a
levy.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
kennedy,
as
i
read
the
holding
in
united
states
vs.
williams,
the
court
found
that
there
was
an
unequivocal
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
section
1346.
and
observed
afterwards
that
a
person
like
mrs.
williams
did
not
have
a
meaningful
remedy.
i
did
not
read
that
to
be...
that
the
construction
of
the
statute
was
driven
by
the
equities.
it
was
an
observation
after
the
fact.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
both
mrs.
williams
and
the
trust
are
in
the
same
position.
both
of
them
paid
the
tax.
both
were
third
parties.
neither
was
a
taxpayer.
in
the
case
of
williams,
the
taxpayer
was
her
husband.
in
the
case
of
the
trust--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--in
this
case,
the
levy
was
an
involuntary
act
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
take
the
money
from
ec
trust,
from
the
deposit
that
was
put
up.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
ginsburg,
the
situation
in
williams,
however,
involved
the
tax
lien.
mrs.
williams
would
not
have
paid
the
tax
had
the
government
not
asserted
the
tax
lien
and
forced
her
to
pay
the
tax
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
house
when
it
was
sold.
it
was
no
more
voluntary
than
a
levy
in
the
sense
that
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
breyer,
the
answer
is
because
1346
also
permits
a
third
party
to
bring
a
refund
action.
it
is
not
restricted
even
though
there
is
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
levies,
1346
was
held
to
be
broad
enough
to...
to
encompass
the
refund
action.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
my
answer
to
that
is
there
is
no
substantive
distinction
between
a
levy
and
a
lien.
and
that
while
williams
dealt
with
a
lien,
and
i
fully
understand
that,
the
taking
by
the
government
was
just
as
involuntary
under
the
levy
as
it
is
with
a
lien.
and
once
section
1346
is
deemed
to
be
broad
enough
or
held
to
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
refund
action,
it
should
encompass
an
action
by
the
levy.
essentially
i'm
arguing
that
the
two
statutes
can
coexist
together
and
should
coexist
together
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
declaration
from
congress
that
7426
is
exclusive.
i
can
support
my
argument
by
the
fact
that
after
williams,
congress
did
make,
did
amend
7426
and
did
make
a
specific
new
remedy
and
they're
exclusive.
congress
could
have
done
that
at
the
time
7426
was
originally
enacted
in
1966
but
did
not
do
so.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
no.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
it,
it
does
not
become
meaningless
because
7426
offers
certain
remedies
that
are
clearly
post
deprivation
such
as
filing
for
an
injunction
to
stop
the
levy,
filing
for
an
injunction
to
stop
a
foreclosure.
those
are
still
viable
under
7426
and
would
fall
within
the
nine-month
period
but
essentially
congress
has
permitted
two
different
complementary
actions
to
seek
a
refund.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
understand
your
question
you're
really
talking
about
the
underlying
policy
of
a
short
statute
of
limitations
driving
certain
types
of--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--but
i
can
say
to
you
that
with
some
degree,
i
think,
of
sound
legal
argument,
that
once
1346
was
found
to
have
unequivocally
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
third
party
refund
actions
in
the
context
of
a
lien
it
should
also
follow
that
it
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
levies
because
there
is
no
fundamental
legal
difference
between
the
manner
in
which
the
money
is
extracted
from
the
third
party.
there
is
no,
the
core
logic
of
the
decision
in
united
states
vs.
williams
is
that
money
was
involuntarily
taken
from
mrs....
from
mrs.
williams.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
stevens,
the...
the
issue
of
the
statute
of
limitations
i
believe
is
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
1346
provides
for
remaining
a
viable
method
of
seeking
a
refund.
and
my
position
is
that
if
1346
does
provide
that
in
the
context
of
a
levy,
then
you
have
in
effect
two
statutory
schemes
which
coexist;
one
is
7426
and
one
is
10...
uh,
1346.
it
is
true
that
they
overlap
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
refund
provision
that
could
be
sought
under
either
one
of
them,
but
7426
is
distinctly
different
in
that
it
offers
pre-deprivation
relief
that
is
not
offered
under
1326.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
yes.
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
a
million
dollars,
it
was
$3
million
and
the
entire
amount
was
paid
in
order
to
bring
the
refund
suit.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
1346
in
my
view
would
not
apply
to
that
situation,
in
that
if
property
was
seized
and
used
to,
under
a
tax
lien,
if
that
was
seized
and
the
government
proceeded
to
sell,
then
the
third
party,
petitioner,
would
have
to
file
for
an
injunction
to
stop
the
foreclosure
sale
under
7426.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
scalia--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--there
is
no
harm
in
proceeding
under
1346
once
the
money
is
paid
because
you're
dealing
with
a
simple
refund
action.
you're
not
dealing
with
trying
to
stop
a
foreclosure
suit
or
stop
a
levy.
you're
dealing
with
a
simple
foreclosure
action.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
rationale
for
having
a
short
statute,
but
once
again
i
point
out
that
you
have
two
statutory
schemes
which
appear
to
be
able
to
be
harmonized
and
coexist
together.
1346
constitutes
or
at
least
the
language
is
clear
and
unequivocal
in
its
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
a
third
party
who
desires
to
collect
a
tax
that's
been
taken
from
that
third
party.
and
with
that
construction,
it
seems
to
me
that
only
congress
can...
can
deal
with
the
question
that
you've
just
raised,
if
congress
wants
to
make
it.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
7426.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
okay.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
justice
breyer,
it
is
fair.
and
it's
fair
for
this
reason,
that
in
the
williams
case
the
very--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--in
the
williams
case,
the
very
same
argument
was
raised,
that
7426
would
be
rendered
meaningless
if,
and
other,
the
quiet
title
action
and
other
actions
would
be
rendered
meanings
less
if
1346
was
construed
to
allow
mrs.
williams
to
have
a
third
party
action.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
the
government
contended
that
mrs.
williams
had
remedies
available
to
her,
certainly
not
a
levy,
because
there
was
no
levy,
but
the
government
was
contending
she
could
have
sought
relief
under
the
quiet
title
act.
she
could
have
sought
relief
by
posting--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--justice
ginsburg,
i,
i
know
you've
found
that
in
the
opinion.
but
at
the
same
time
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
government
was
contending
that
the
quiet
title
act
was
available
to
mrs.
williams,
and
also
that
she
could
have
simply
put
the
money
up.
and...
put
the
money
up,
and
the
land
would
have
been
released
and
there
was
an
argument
over
whether
the
secretary
would
have
discretion
to
turn
her
down.
but
the
point
is
there
were
other
remedies
out
there,
and
they
were
not
deemed--
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
--the
other
remedies
i
understand
were
determined
to
be
not
meaningful
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
but
i'm
pointing
out
that
argument
was
raised
and
rejected.
and
it
was
rejected
because,
because
1346
as
i
understand
it
has
a
life
of
its
own,
so
to
speak,
and
it
was
construed
to
be
an
unequivocal
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
i
return
to
my
original
buoyant
that
if
that
is
the
case
then
the
two
statutes
most
coexist
together.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
the
government
argues
that
a.s.
kreider
has
relevance
to
this
case
and
i
will
submit
to
the
court
that
it
does
not.
the
analysis
in
a.s.
kreider
about
a
more
specific
statute
following
a
general
statute
controlling
was
based
upon
the
peculiar
syntax
of
the
statute
in
question.
the
analysis
in
a.s.
kreider
was
that
the
more
general
statute
was
phrased
in
the
negative
and
that
therefore
all
it
did
was
set
an
outside
time
limit
that
congress
was
free
to
shorten
with
a
subsequent
statute.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
there
was...
there
is
no
similar
analysis
that
you
can
apply
to
1346
and
7426.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
yes.
mr.
francis
s.
ainsa
jr
two
statutes
bearing
on
the
same
remedy.
and
i
submit
that
the
a.s.
kreider
analysis
is
not
relevant
here.
the
government
also
relies
on
brown
versus
the
general
services
administration
for
the
proposition
that
a
very
detailed,
complete,
balanced,
structured
statute
will
control
over
a
more
general
statute,
and
the
argument
is
of
course
that
7426
is
that
type
of
statute.
but
the
problem
is
in
the
brown
case
we
were
dealing,
the
court
was
dealing,
with
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
civil
rights
act
was
clearly
the
first
piece
of
legislation
that
had
been
enacted
by
congress
to
remedy
federal
employment
discrimination.
it
was
a
brand
new
remedy.
in
the
case
before
the
court
today,
7426
was
a
response
to
a
particular
issue
that
was
raised
in
1966
and
that
was
that
claimants
who
desired
to
seek
redress
from
the
government
when
their
property
was
taken
were
suing
the
director.
they
were
suing
the
tax
collector.
this
was
just
a
statute
to
give
them
a
remedy
directly
against
the
government.
it
wasn't
creating
a
brand
new
situation.
it
was
clarifying
that
now
you
could
sue
the
government
directly
as
opposed
to
the
tax
collector.
and
in
fact,
the
federal
tax
lien
act
prohibited
suits
against
government
officials,
as
was
previously
the
practice
in
the
united
states.
and
so
it's,
this
issue
of
implied
repeal
with
the
shorter
statute
i
don't
believe
is
apropos
to
the
situation
that
confronts
us
here.
and
i
would
like
to
also
simply
conclude
my
argument
with
regards
to
the
government's
contention
that
the
government
needs
to
know.
in
this
particular
case
the
tax
years
in
question
were
1981
through
1984.
the
government
did
not
assess
the
taxpayer
until
1993
and
1994,
12
years
after
the
first
tax
year.
the
government
did
not
levy
until
1999,
which
was
18
years
after
the
first
tax
year.
during
this
time
the
government
knew,
very
clearly
knew,
what
the
situation
was
in
this
case
and
for
whatever
reason
did
not
take
prompt
action.
therefore,
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
ask
that
you
reverse
and
send
this
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
proceedings
under
the
refund
statute.
