justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
law,
we
don't...
we
certainly
don't
want
to
deprive
any
statutory
provision
of
its
whole
purpose
and
effect.
and
as
i
understand
the
purpose
of
this
especially
short
statute
of
limitations,
it
is
to
enable
the
government
to
dispose
of
the
property
that
it
has
seized,
and
to
be
able
to
give
clear
title
to
it
without
somebody
coming
back,
you
know,
many
years
later
and
saying
this
property
should
not
have
been
taken.
how
is
that
purpose
served
if
indeed
you
can
proceed
under
the
provision
that
has
a
longer
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
amount
wasn't
paid
and
what
if
your
client
just
sat
back
and
the,
the
assets,
or
let's
say
some
real
estate
were,
were
seized
by
the
government.
would
the
1346
action
still
lie?
or
is
it
only
for
return
of
money
that,
that's
been
paid
to
satisfy
the
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the,
it
seems
to
me
the
principal
problem
that
the
government
was
facing
and
justified
the
short
statute,
wasn't
it?
that
is
the
need
to
get,
to
be
able
to
convey
clear
title
to
this
property
that
it
has
seized.
but
once...
once
the
money
is
put
up,
and
what
the
government
has
taken
is
in
effect
payment
of
the
tax,
maybe
there
is
no
harm
in
proceeding
under
1346.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
helping
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
was,
was
the
more
specific
statute
there
enacted
after
the
more
general
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
i
ask
is
we...
we
do
have
a
principle
which
i
think
is
a
sound
one,
that
repeals
by
implication
are
not
fatal.
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
enactment
of
the
more
narrow
statute
impliedly
repeals
the
cause
of
action
that
existed
under
1346.
do
you
know
if
any
of
your
cases
that
you
cite,
even
those
outside
of
the
internal
revenue
field,
involve
more
specific
statutes
enacted
after
the
general
statute
that
they
supposedly
limit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
certainly
true
when
the
two
are
enacted
at
the
same
time,
obviously.
or
even
when
the,
when
the
general
is
enacted
after
the
more
specific
one
and
does
not
thereby
limit
the
more
specific
one.
but,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--pre-williams
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
that
argument,
did
the
government
make
that
argument,
in
williams?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that...
that
congress
had
enacted
another
statute
which
presumes
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
1346?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
even
if
it
wasn't
available
to
her,
the
fact
that
there
was
another
statute
the
whole
premise
for
which
is
the
unavailability
of
a
remedy
under
1346,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
have,
that
would
have
strengthened
the
government's
case
in
williams.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forgot
about
that
footnote.
