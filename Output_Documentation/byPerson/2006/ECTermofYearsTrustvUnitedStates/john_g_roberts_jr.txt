chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
05-1541,
ec
term
of
years
trust
vs.
united
states.
mr.
ainsa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
underlying
principle
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
strictly
construed.
and
when
you
have
a
waiver
on
the
broader
statute,
but
shouldn't
you
read
them
together
with
the
specific
to
suggest
that
they
weren't
waiving
sovereign
immunity
when
a
more
specific
statute
governed,
except
to
the
extent
of
the
provisions
in
that
more
specific
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
may
be
situations
where
the
government,
having
levied,
doesn't
feel
the
need
to
pursued
other
remedies
available
to
it.
and
if
you
then
allow
a
challenge
to
the
levy
to
come
in
later
the
person
they
would
have
proceeded
against
if
they
didn't
have
the
levy
may
have
left
the
country,
may
have
dissipated
the
funds
that
they
would
otherwise
go
after.
they
need
to
know
early
on
that
they
are
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
if
they
have
levied
on
the
wrong
property,
and
that's
why
you
have
a
short
statute
to
clear
that
up
as
soon
as
possible.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
was
it
so
hard
for
them
to
say
that
this
is
an
exclusive
remedy,
as
they
have
done
in
other
situations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
even
all
the
more
reason
for
them
to
say.
i
mean.
if
there's
confusion
about
what
remedies
are
available
and
they
want
it
to
be
exclusive,
it's
easy
enough
to
say
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again
that
suggests
that
they
know
how
to
spell
out
exclusivity
when
they
have
it
in
mind,
and
they
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
an
action
under
1346.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
williams
decision
came
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue,
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hungar
has
a
further
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hungar
has
a
further
question.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ainsa,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ainsa.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
announcement
in
two
cases
this
morning
the
first
is
number
05-1541,
ec
term
of
years
trust
versus
united
states.
justice
souter
has
authored
the
opinion
in
this
case,
and
he
has
asked
me
to
announce
it
for
him.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
internal
revenue
service
determined
that
elmer
and
dorothy
cullers
claimed
unwarranted
income
tax
deductions
in
the
1980s
but
by
the
time
the
government
tried
to
collect
from
the
cullers’
they
have
transferred
some
of
their
assets
to
petitioner
ec
term
of
years
trust.
the
irs
levied
on
the
trust’s
bank
account
and
collected
over
$3
million.
almost
a
year
after
that
the
trust
filed
an
action
claiming
that
the
irs
has
wrongfully
levied
on
it’s
property
to
collect
taxes
owed
by
another.
such
wrongful
levy
actions
are
specifically
authorized
by
statute,
but
they
are
subject
to
a
nine
month
filing
deadline
because
the
trust
had
missed
that
deadline
the
district
court
dismissed
it’s
complain.
the
trust
then
re-filed
its
action
as
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund
which
has
a
less
demanding
filing
deadline,
but
the
district
court
dismissed
it
again
reasoning
that
a
wrongful
levy
claim
was
the
trust’s
only
recourse.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
with
the
ninth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
when
congress
creates
a
precisely
drawn
and
detailed
statute
it
preempts
more
general
remedies.
here
congress
specifically
tailored
a
remedy
for
third
parties
challenging
a
wrongful
levy
and
provided
a
nine
month
statute
of
limitations.
that
short
period
was
no
accident
since
the
irs
must
be
promptly
be
told
if
it
has
seized
property
from
the
wrong
party.
but
this
deadline
could
be
easily
awaited
if
as
the
trust
argues
third
parties
could
always
reformulate
their
wrongful
levy
claim
as
one
for
a
tax
refund,
resort
to
a
tax
refund
claim
is
therefore
preempted.
the
trust
also
relies
on
united
states
against
williams,
a
case
in
which
we
held
that
a
wrongful
lien
claim
could
be
brought
in
the
form
of
a
tax
refund
action.
but
we
said
in
williams
that
no
remedy
other
than
a
tax
refund
was
open
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
trust
challenges
a
levy
not
a
lien
and
could
have
made
a
timely
wrongful
levy
claim
for
the
relief
it
now
seeks.
justice
souter’s
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
