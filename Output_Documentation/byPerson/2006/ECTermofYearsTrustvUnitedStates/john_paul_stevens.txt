but
isn't
there
this
difference
between
the
two.
one
of
them...
you're
not
challenging
the
amount
of
the
tax
in
this
case,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
challenging
the
amount
of
the
assessed
tax,
are
you?
you're
just...
whether
they
can
collect
it
from
this
particular
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
the
basic
difference
between
the
two
statutes,
that
one
of
them
deals
with
a
fight
about
how
much
money
the
taxpayer
owes,
and
the
other
one
deals
with
the
method
of
collection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
does
seem
to
me
if
you
think
of
the
two
statutes
as
performing
rather
separate
functions,
one
primarily
focused
at
the
method
of
collection,
the
other
the
amount
of
tax,
makes
quite
good
sense
to
have
different
statute
of
limitations
for
the
two,
because
there
is
an
interest
in
the
prompt
resolution
of
the
former
issue
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
latter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
with
regard
to
levies
answers
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
sure,
there
is
a
waive
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
the
question
is
how
long
does
the...
how
promptly
do
you
have
to
act?
