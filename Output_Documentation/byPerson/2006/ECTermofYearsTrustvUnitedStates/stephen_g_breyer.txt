justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
the
obvious
difference...
i
may
have
missed
this...
but
you
say,
in
the
case,
a
taxpayer
owed
some
money
and
the
government
via
a
lien
took
property
from
a
different
person
who
then
had
to
pay
the
tax
who
then
had
to
get
rid
of
the
lien
and
wanted
it
back.
and
in
this
case
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing
but
they
did
it
via
a
levy.
so
you
say
if
the
first
could
sue
so
could
the
second.
but
the
difference,
the
obvious
difference,
which
maybe
you
have
explained
and
i
missed,
is
that
in
the
second
case,
namely
this
case,
there
is
a
specific
statute
that
says
you
have
to
do
it
with
a
levy
in
nine
months,
and
in
the
other
case
there
wasn't
such
a
statute.
why
isn't
that
the
obvious
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
encompasses
a
lien
for
a
refund
action
in
the
case
where
you
took
the
property
via
a
lien.
and
you'd
say...
they
say,
i
guess,
but
it
doesn't
encompass
it
when
you
take
it
via
a
levy.
why
not?
because
of
the
specific,
the
same
thing
i
just
said.
now
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
your
whole
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
your
interpretation
is
correct
then
are
there
many
such
cases
where
the
government
takes
property
via
a
levy
and
the
person
who
wants
to
sue
would
get
worried
about
nine
months,
because
obviously
he
would
think
i
can
sue
under
a...
kind
of
thing.
it's
two
years.
so
are
there
still
some
where
he
would
have
to
worry
about
nine
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
are...
in
your
interpretation,
does
the
nine-month
statute
become
meaningless?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the,
the
statute
that
you
point
to
talks
about
taking
a
civil
action
against
the
united
states.
when
there
has
been
a
wrongful
levy,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
an
injunctive
action.
so
i
would
reading
it
think
it
encompasses
both
actions
for
injunctions,
which
are
rare,
probably,
and
what
i
think
is
not
rare
at
all,
an
action
for
damages
or
money
back.
now
your
reading
of
the
statute
takes
that
whole
ordinary
case,
where
people
are
just
suing
to
get
back
some
money,
and
it
says
our
nine-month
statute
of
limitations
here
is
meaningless.
all
it
applies
to
are
injunctive
actions
which
i
bet
are
far
and
few
between.
you
can
tell
me
i'm
wrong
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
won't
say
you've
made
it
meaningless
but
you
have
eviscerated
it.
is
that
fair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
my
characterization
fair?
[laughter]
you
want
to
say
no
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
it
have?
because
there
i
think
we
are
talking
about
liens
and
it
doesn't
cover
liens,
the
specifics
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
looks
like
it's
the
same
in
the
kreider
case.
i
can't
tell,
i
don't
know.
but
this
case
was
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
acted
after
the
general
refund
statute,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
the
prior
case
it
seems
to
be
a
specific
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1926.
i
just
got
it
out
of
the
library.
they
give
it
to
us,
you
know,
if
you
ask
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
was
the
1926
code
and
it
concerned
1926
income,
so
it
must
have
been
brought,
the
suit,
fairly
close
to
when
that
was
enacted.
and
the
general
provision
was
a
general
judicial
code
provision
having
to
do
with
general
statute
of
limitations
and,
no,
it
doesn't
say.
it
looks...
i
mean,
it
sounds
as
if
that
had
been
long
in
existence.
