justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
did
the
court
point
out
twice
in
williams
that
section
7426
was
not
available?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there
was
no
levy.
it
was
only
a
lien.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
congress
provides
a
special
remedy
for
a
particular
class
of
persons,
that
special
remedy
usually
excludes
a
more
general
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
took
care
to
point
out
why
those
were
not
realistic
remedies.
but
here
there
is
a
prompt
and
efficient
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
determination
that
the
word
taxpayer
encompassed
someone
who
had,
in
fact,
paid
the
tax.
here
you
don't
even
have
that,
because
the
tax
wasn't
paid
directly
by
the
ec
trust.
the
trust
deposited
the
money
in
the
bank,
and
then
the
government
levied
on
it,
as
distinguished
from
williams,
where
mrs.
williams,
in
fact,
wrote
a
check
to
the
internal
revenue
service
covering
her
husband's
tax
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
whole
case
was
about
whether
she
indeed
qualified
as
a
taxpayer,
having
voluntarily
paid
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
was
an
involuntary
act,
whereas
in
williams,
she
stepped
forward
and
paid
the
tax
and
claimed
on
that
basis
that
she
was
the
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just...
you
just
pointed
to
situations
where
one
to
expect
action
to
be
taken
promptly.
you
don't
want
to
wait
to,
to
get
an
injunction
against
a
levy
because
the
government
might
be
there
and
levy
on
the
property
and
then
you're
out
of
luck.
where
the
incompatibility
exists
is
post
deprivation,
when
the
nine-month,
the
interest
in
having
these
claims
resolved
properly
is
totally
defeated
if
you
can
get
the
longer
statute
of
limitations
under
the
general
refund
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why
the
code
has
that
nine-month
period
instead
of
the
two-year
or
in
fact
four-years
because
you
have
to
go
to
the
administrative
process
first.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
nine-months
is
to
get
people
to
act
quickly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government...
and
the
opinion
points
out
that
if
she
had
gone
the
quiet
title
route
she
would
have
lost
the
advantageous...
she
would
have
had
to
make.
she
could
never
complete
a
quiet
title
suit
within
the
time
that
she
needed
to
execute
this
sale.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the,
and
the
opinion
suggests...
not
merely
suggests,
determines...
that
those
other
remedies,
unlike
7426
in
cases
where
it
applies,
were
ineffective.
the
government
raised
other
remedies
and
the
court
said
they
were
ineffective.
