if
7426
had
not
been
enacted,
wouldn't
this
case
have
fallen
within
1346
as
interpreted
by
williams.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
could
you
point
to
in
the
language
of
1346
that
would
take
this
case
outside
of
1346
as
interpreted
in
williams?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
this
case
would
have
fallen
within
1346
as
interpreted
by
williams
until...
then
you
must
be
arguing
that
1346
was
in
part
impliedly
repealed
when
7426
was
enacted.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
that
make
your
argument
stronger?
if
congress
didn't
think
that
1346
applied,
then
surely
it
didn't
intend
to
repeal
it.
