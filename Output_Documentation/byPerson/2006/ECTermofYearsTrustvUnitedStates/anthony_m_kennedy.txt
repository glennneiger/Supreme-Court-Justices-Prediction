the
government
does
cite
the
principle
that
when
there's
a
specific
statutory
scheme
that
controls
over
a
more
general
one.
it
doesn't
cite
a
tax
case
for
that,
at
least
as
i
recall.
has
that
principle
ever
been
applied
in
the
tax
code,
do
you
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
or
the
government
can
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong...
but
there
is
this
difference
also
that
in
a
refund
suit,
you
have
to
pay
the
money.
the
government
has
the
money
before
you
can
bring
the
refund
suit.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidentally,
i'm
just
curious,
if
the
underlying
assessment...
if
you
wished
to
have
challenged
the
underlying
assessment,
it's
for
a
million
dollars,
can
you
pay
$100,000
and
then
bring
the
refund
suit
in
order
to
test
the
validity
of
the
tax,
or
do
you
have
to
pay
the
whole
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
argument
is
probably
based
on
the
statute.
i
just
question
one
phrase
you
mentioned,
which
was
that
williams
was
not
driven
by
the
equities.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
wholly
driven
by
the
equities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
my
earlier
question,
if
there
is
a
million-dollar
tax
liability,
and
there
is
a
levy
on
the
bank
account
for
$100,000,
do
you
have
to
pay
the
extra
900,000
before
can
you
bring--
the
refund
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's,
that's
also
a
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
a
citation
for
that
as
would
apply
to
the
internal
revenue
code?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
there's
frustration.
perhaps
i'm
missing
something.
it
seems
to
me
that
for
years
the
revenue
code
has
had
two
basic
schemes.
one
is
you
can
contest
the
liability
before
you
pay
the
money.
the
other
is
you
pay
the
money
and
sue
for
refund.
and
one
requires
you
go
to
the
tax
court
and
the
other
district
court
and
so
forth.
so
these
are
two
different
schemes
and
here
you
have
to...
we
are
advised
that
even
if
there
was
a
levy
for
$100,000
you,
couldn't
contest
it
unless
you
paid
the
extra
900.
so
those
are
two
very
different
schemes.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
because
the
government
doesn't
have
the
money.
but
in
the
refund
suit
the
government
has
the
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
often
does,
but
not
necessarily,
and
doesn't
have
to
have
all
the
amount.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
both
statutes
in
kreider
i
take
it
applied
to
the
refund
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
were
two
statutes
bearing
on
the
same
remedy.
