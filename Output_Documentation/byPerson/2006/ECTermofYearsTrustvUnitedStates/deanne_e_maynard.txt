ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
congress
creates
a
specific
remedy
for
a
specific
situation
that
remedy
forecloses
resort
to
a
more
general
remedy
when
that
general
remedy
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
specific
remedy.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor.
the
a.s.
kreider
decision
that
we
discuss
in
our
brief
is
about
was
whether
or
not
the
sorter
statute
of
limitations,
ironically,
in
the
case
for
refund
suit,
applied,
rather
than
the
broad
general
tucker
act
statute
of
limitations.
and
this
court
held
that
the
specific
controlled
over
the
general
because
congress
was
entitled
to
provide
more
specifically
in
a
particular
situation
when
the
need
called
for
it.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
both
of
those
statutes,
it's
been
a
long
time,
your
honor.
i'm
not,
i'm
not
totally--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
not
sure
if
they
answer
that
precise
question,
but--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
implied
repeal
analysis
is
not
the
proper
analysis
to
apply
here,
because
the
proper
principle
is
that
the
specific
remedy
forecloses
resort
to
the
more
general
remedy,
when
two
things
are
true.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in...
in
this
court's
case,
if
i
can
answer
your,
the
principle
of
your
question,
your
honor,
which
is
that
the
replied
repeal
doctrine
is
not
the
proper
analysis
here
because
the
specific
controls
the
general.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
we
would
certainly
have
a
more
difficult
argument
here
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor.
but
williams'
specific
withholding
was...
didn't
answer
the
question
at
issue
here,
because
it
only
held
that
a
person
who
had
been
subjected
to
a
lien,
involuntarily
paid
it
under
duress,
could
be
a
taxpayer
within
the
meaning
of
1346.
but
it
didn't
answer
the
question
here,
which
is
whether
or
not
when
congress
has
provided
specifically
for
parties
in
petitioner's
situation
and
created
a
remedial
scheme
that
would
be
wholly
frustrated--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
would
be
a
difficult
argument
to
make,
that
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
erroneously
or
illegally
collected
tax.
but
that
was
the
same
case
in
a.s.
kreider.
that
was
the
same
language
in
a.s.
kreider,
the
erroneously
collected
tax.
yet
the
court
held
that
the
more
specific
refund
statute
of
limitations
there
applied.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
one
can
look
at
it
that
way,
your
honor.
but
i
think
if
one
looks
at
it
that
way
then
i
think
this
court's
cases
in
brown
and
block
are
how
you
apply
the
implied
repeal
analysis
when
a
specific
statute
would
be
wholly
fully
frustrated
by
application
of
a
more
general
statute.
and
that's
particularly
true
where
it's
uncertain
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
specific
statute.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
they
are
two
very
different
schemes,
your
honor,
and
one
is
for
the
situation
that
petitioner
faces,
which
is
a
third
party
whose
property
is
levied
upon
to
collect
the
taxes
of
another,
and
it
has
its
own
venue
provisions,
its
own
jurisdictional
provisions,
its
own
short
statute
of
limitations.
importantly,
however--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
no,
your
honor.
in
a
levy
suit
the
government
often
does
have
the
property.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
not...
i
think,
your
honor,
the
flora
requirement,
which
is
a
judicially
interpretation
on
the
refund
statute
which
requires
you,
a
taxpayer
to
pay
all
of
its
tax
liability
for
a
given
year
before
it
can
bring
a
refund
statute
challenge,
actually
supports
our
argument
here
because
it
shows
how
complicated
it
would
be
to
apply
that
scheme
when
you're
talking
about
a
party
who
doesn't
owe
the
tax.
we
haven't...
the
government
has
not
assessed
the
tax
against
the
trust
here.
it
believes
the
trust
is
a
nominee
or
alter
ego
of
the
taxpayer
and
the...
the
wrongful
levy
statute
has
a
short
statute
of
limitations
for
the
precise
reason
that
if
we
seize
the
property
of
the
trust
the
government
needs
to
know
promptly
if
the
trust
claims
it's
not
the
taxpayer's
property
because
the
government,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
will
cease
going
after
the
taxpayer
if
it
believes
it
has
already
collected
the
tax
from
someone
else
that
it
believes
to
be
holding
the
money
for
the
taxpayer,
which
is
different
and
crucially
different
than
in
a
refund
suit,
as
justice
stevens
alluded
to,
because
in
a
refund
suit
where
the
taxpayer
brings
the
challenge
and
has
paid
the
tax,
at
the
end
of
that
suit
either
the
government
has
to
pay
the
money
back
to
the
taxpayer
in
a
refund
or
the
government
gets
to
keep
the
tax
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
in
a
third
party
challenge,
whether
the
third
party
brings
it
pre-deprivation
or
post-deprivation,
the
government's
interest
is
knowing
whether
or
not
the
third
party
has
taxpayer
property
or
not.
because
if
it
turns
out
that
it's
not
the
taxpayer's
property
the
government
needs
to
pursue
the
taxpayer.
and
congress
accounted
for
that
not
only
in
7426
by
the
short
statute
of
limitations,
but
also
for
the
expression
suspension
of
the
government's
period
of
time
that
it
can
pursue
the
taxpayer.
the,
the
section
7426
expressly
suspends
the
time
period
during
the
running
of
a
third
party
challenge
whether
that's
pre
or
post
deprivation.
in
addition,
the...
if
i
can
go
back
to
justice
scalia,
i
would
like
to
impress
upon
you
why
we
don't
believe
the
implied
repeal
doctrine
is
applicable
here,
and
not
only
is
it
because
the
specific
controls
the
general
when
it
would
be
wholly
frustrated
as
it
would
be
here
by
both
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
and
its
express
suspension,
but
also
because
the
availability
of
the
general
remedy
was
uncertain
at
the
time
that
congress
passed...
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
implied
repeal
doctrine
that's
the
proper
analysis:
what
did
the
1966
congress
think
it
needed
to
say
in
order
to
make
this
the
exclusive
remedy?
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
in
1966,
your
honor.
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
when
the
congress
was
deciding
how
to
write
this
provision,
there
was
certainly
no
authoritative
pronouncement
that,
that
the,
that
third
parties
could
bring
a
suit,
and
indeed
the
law
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
cases
say
it
matters
what
the
congress
saw
at
the
time
it
passed
the
statute
in
brown
and
block.
but
the
reason
it
does
matter
as
a
logical
matter
is
that
the
state
of
the
law
was
such
that
third
parties
couldn't
bring
a
refund
suit
under
1346.
the
actions
that
had
been
allowed,
your
honor,
were
against
the
irs
officials
and
those
were
expressly
replaced
by
the
statute.
congress
expressly
replaced
them
in
section
7426(d)
and
(e),
which
is
on
12a
of
our,
of
our
petition.
so
that
shows
that
congress
did
intend
to
make
this
the
exclusive
remedy.
the
other
reason
why
i
think
you
can--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--did
we
make
the
argument
in
williams?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
government
conceded
in
williams
that
7426
was
not
available
to
ms.
williams
there
because
she
had
only
been
subjected
to
a
lien,
not
a
levy.
so
the
remedies
the
government
was
pointing
to
in
that
case
as
exclusive
of
the
1346
remedy
were
the
quiet
title
action
and
a
discretionary--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
we
did
point
to
the
statute,
your
honor,
and
suggest
that
the
congress
had
made
it
available.
i
think
the
other
reason
why
the
implied
repeal
doctrine
is
not
the
right
analysis
here
is
that
section
7426
did
not
withdraw
any
substantive
rights.
this,
the
trust
here
is
simply
trying
to
take
advantage
of
another
remedial
provision,
1346,
and
rename
its
cause
of
action.
they're
bringing
exactly
the
same...
their
complaint
is
substantively
identical
to
the
complaint
they
brought
in
their
first
action.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
bless
them,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
believe
it
had
been.
it
was
a
tucker
act
provision.
thank
you.
that
would
be
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia.
but
in
direct
response
to
the
question
you
started
with,
justice
breyer,
congress...
the
general
statute
of
limitations
for
refund
actions
did
already
exist.
in
fact,
the
government
believes
it's
significant
when
congress
passed
7426,
instead
of
referring
to
that
specific
provision,
it
placed
in
the
same
section
of
the
code
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations
specifically
for
these
actions.
it
created
a
new
subsection
and
said
7426
actions
must
be
brought
within
9
months.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
as
i
indicated,
your
honor,
at
the
time
there
was
no
authoritative
pronouncement.
if
even--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
remedies
that
have
been
allowed
by
the
courts,
your
honor...
and
we
believe,
in
the
absence
of
any
appropriate
waiver...
but
the
actions
that
have
been
allowed
have
been
allowed
against
irs
officials,
and
congress
did
expressly
replace
those,
on
12a,
in
7426(d):
"no
action
may
be
maintained
against
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states.
"
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
trying
to
discern
the
intent
of
the
1966
congress
one
has
to
look
at
the
state
of
the
law
in
1966.
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
and
certainly
no
authoritative
pronouncement
at
the
time
that
1346
covered
this
type
of
action,
and
i
don't
think--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
that's
probably
how
the
government
viewed
it,
your
honor.
but
certainly
i
don't
think
one
should
ascribe
for
purposes
of
implied
repeal,
in
other
words
to
assume
a
presumption,
by
making
the
congress
prescient
of
what
this
court
was
going
to
decide
in
1995.
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
concede,
although
the
petitioner
would
like
to
argue,
that
williams'
holding
is
as
broad
as
it
is.
williams
was
about
a
very
particular
situation,
a
woman,
as
i
said,
who
had
a
lien
placed
on
her,
and
the
court
didn't
answer
this
question
of
whether
someone
who
had,
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated,
who
had
a
levy
placed
on
there,
could
be
a
taxpayer
within
the
meaning
of
1346
as
this
court
held
in
williams.
justice
kennedy,
also
on
your
question
about
the
tax
code,
although
we
don't
cite
it
in
our
brief,
estate
of
ramani
is
another
case
in
which
this
court
had
in
effect
held
that
a
specific
provision
in
the
tax
code,
in
this
very
tax
lien
act,
took
priority
over
a
more
general
provision
that
had
to
do
with
the
priority
of
the
united
states'
claims.
and
that's
estate
of
ramani,
525
u.s.
517.
i
believe
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
government
would
ask
the
court
to
find
that
7426
is
the...
except
i
have
one
more
thing
to
add.
getting
lots
of
help
today
from
all
quarters.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
he
wants
me
to
point
out
to
the
court
that,
in
addition
to...
it's
always
nice
to
have
help.
in
addition
to
the
great
american
federal
savings
&
loan
case,
justice
scalia,
which
indicated
that
the
implied
repeal
analysis
is
not
appropriate
when
you're
talking
about
a
subsequent
simply
remedial
provision
that
doesn't
withdraw
substantive
rights,
the
court
in
a
case
authored
i
believe
by
your
honor,
rancho
palos
verdes,
in
footnote
2
made
that
same
point
last
term.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
hungar
might
have
questioned
your
memory.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm.
