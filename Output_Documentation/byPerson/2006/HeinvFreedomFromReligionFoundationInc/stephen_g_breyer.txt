justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
i'm
back...
i
really...
i'm
surprised.
and
it's
probably
my
fault.
but
that
i
thought...
i
started
where
justice
scalia
was
with
his
first
question.
i
thought
this
had
something
to
do
with
whether
congress
passed
a
statute
or
the
president
acted
on
his
own.
but
listening
to
you
now
i
think,
i
can't
decide...
i
think
you
have
a
different
argument.
suppose...
i'm
just
trying
to
understand.
suppose
that
congress
passes
a
law
and
it
says
it's
a
very
nice
thing
to
commemorate
the
pilgrims
by
building
a
government
church
at
plymouth
rock,
where
we
will
have
the
regular
worship
in
the
puritan
religion.
now
can
a
taxpayer
from
california
in
your
view
challenge
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
not?
because
i
thought
flast
made
clear
that
they
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
go
to
a
private
group?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
that
if
the
government
has
the
most
amazing,
let's...
i'm
trying
to
think
of
something
more
amazing
that
what
i
just
thought
of.
[laughter]
all
over
america,
they
build
churches
dedicated
to
one
religion;
and
congress
passes
a
statute
and
says
in
every
city,
town,
and
hamlet,
we
are
going
to
have
a
minister,
a
government
minister,
a
government
church,
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
this
particular
sect
is
the
true
sect;
and
they
pass
a
statute
like
that,
nobody
could
challenge
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
you're
saying,
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know,
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--everybody
else
who
doesn't
want
to
go
just
avoids
it.
so
that
they
don't
have
to
do
anything.
they
just
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who?
who?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they
don't
walk
into
it
because
it
is
not
"our
church".
so
they
don't
walk
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
moreover,
they
don't...
they
don't
feel
it's
discriminatory.
it's
just
we're
doing
this
to
commemorate
the
pilgrims,
and
we'll
give
the
money
to
any
group
that's
a
pilgrim.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
wrong
with
just
saying
that
flast
stands
for
the
proposition
that
when
the
government
spends
money
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
a
taxpayer...
after
all,
the
money
comes
from
the
taxpayer...
can
bring
a
lawsuit?
and
the
reason
that
they
do
that
is
because
the
establishment
clause
is
an
important
joint
part
of
the
religion
clauses;
and
there'd
be
no
other
way
to
bring
such
a
challenge.
and
sometimes
it's
that
simple
principle,
and
when
we
depart
from
that
principle,
say
by
giving
property
away
instead
of
giving
money
away,
you
don't
have
the
standing.
so
we
have
a
pretty
clear,
simple
rule.
that
rule
applies
whether
it's
congress
or
the
president
acting
under
congressional
authority,
et
cetera,
which
i
think
is
close
to
what
the
other
side--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
there
is
a
real
case
or
controversy,
because
people
become
terribly
upset
when
they
see
some
other
religion
getting
the
money
from
the
state
for
the...
for
building
a
church,
for
example,
and
that's
why:
there's
a
real
controversy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
the
kind
of
upset
that
is
a
genuine
injury
if
you
look
to
the
objectives
of
the
establishment
clause
and
possibly
that
kind
of
genuine
injury
is
not
the
case
when
you
look
to
objectives
of
various
other
clauses
of
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
was
saying.
i
said
that
flast
then
encapsulates
that
principle
drawn
out
of
the
objectives
of
the
establishment
clause
in
a
rule;
and
the
rule
is
what
i
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
based
on
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
fact,
you
have...
just
help
me
with
one
point
here.
i
mean,
i
see
that
deciding
what's
incidental
and
what
isn't
incidental
will
be
difficult.
i
guess
many
of
these
cases
would
end
up
being
decided
on
the
merits,
there
is
no
violation
on
the
merits,
or
maybe
sometimes
there
is.
but
i'd
started
thinking
of
the
question
of
standing
by
thinking
that
there
are
strong
feelings
when
the
government
spends
money
in
favor
of
one
religion
and
not
another.
after
all,
they
led
to
the
30
years
war.
we
see
that
in
other
places
in
the
world
today.
people
feel
strongly.
and
if,
in
fact,
they
have
that
terribly
strong
feeling
and
can't
make
any
challenge
because
the
feelings
are
shared
by
many,
then
there
are
no
cases
in
the
courts
at
all,
and
the
government
can
do
what
it
wants
without
challenge.
so
in
flast,
they
carved
out
an
exception,
and
the
exception
was
where
the
taxing
and
spending
clauses
were
involved,
because
madison
and
others
said
this
is
aimed
at
"government
shall
not
tax
and
spend.
"
so
that
was
my
theory.
and
all
we're
saying
is
where
there's
a
big
taxing
and
spending
and
it
isn't
incidental,
there's
standing.
now
we're
worried
about
the
merits.
simple
and
clear.
to
which
the
response
was,
which
has
me
a
little
worried
frankly,
was
that,
well,
that
was
justice
stewart's
position,
or
roughly
speaking.
but
the
court
rejected
that
quite
clearly,
and
if
you
look
at
later
cases,
they
reject
it
too.
and
therefore,
whatever
you
might
think
of
it,
it
isn't
the
law.
and
i'm
not
free
to
think
whatever,
i
have
to
think
exactly
in
accordance
with
what
the
cases
say.
so
what
is
your
response?
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
that
what
justice
stewart's
view,
insofar
as
it
was
rejected,
that
flast
suggested
even
broader
standing,
but
it
suggested
at
least
what
justice
stewart
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
neatly,
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
thing.
are
your
clients
claiming
that
it
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
for
the
president
to
go
to
lots
and
lots
of
prayer
breakfasts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
never
met
anyone
who
did,
but
i
guess
there
is
a
legitimate
concern,
somebody
might
think
that,
i
guess.
and
i
guess
that
if
people...
there
is
some
tendency
of
the
people
that
are
worried,
you
know,
there
are
pro
ses,
there
are
all
kinds
of
people,
somebody
could
claim
that.
so
you
want
a
way
to
keep
them
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
justice
kennedy's
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
they're
worried--
about
is
will
this
word
"incidental"
and...
be
sufficient
to
keep
out
the
people
who
might
somehow
decide
they
want
to
claim,
which
sounds
like
a
frivolous
claim,
that
the
president
can't
go
to
a
prayer
breakfast.
now
does
the
word
"incidental"
do
that?
that's
what
i
think--
