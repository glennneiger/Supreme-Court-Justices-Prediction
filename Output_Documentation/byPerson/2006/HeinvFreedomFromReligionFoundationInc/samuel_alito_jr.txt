justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
general
clement,
are
you...
are
arguing
that
these
lines
that
you're
drawing
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
an
abstract
sense?
or
are
you
just
arguing
that
this
is
the
best
that
can
be
done
that
this
is
the
best
that
can
be
done
within
the
body
of
precedent
that
the
court
has
handed
down
in
this
area?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
pincus--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there
have
been
federal
spending
programs
declared
unconstitutional
under
the
establishment
clause,
and
can
you
cite
any
instance
in
which
such
a
holding
ing
has
caused
a
reduction
in
tax
rates?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
see,
your
traceability
either
covers
every
case
or
it
covers
no
case.
in
real
world
taxation
terms,
no
case
would
ever
meet
the
test.
but
in,
in
purely
conceptual
terms,
is
any
federal
money
being
spent,
every
case
involving
any
expenditure
of
money,
even
the
portion
of
the
marshal's
salary
that
is
devoted
to
convening
the
court
in
the
morning,
would
be
sufficient.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
when
this
program
was
set
up,
nothing
said
about
faith
whatsoever?
this
was
just
going
to
be
a
general
program
of
outreach
to
community
service
organizations,
but
plaintiffs
claimed
that
as
the
program
was
being
administered
it
was
heavily
favoring
religious
organizations.
would
that
come
out
the
same
way
in
your
judgment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
depends
totally
on
how
they
characterize?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
distinction
between
taxing,
between
taxing
and
spending
and
the
property
clause,
makes
any
sense?
do
you
think
james
madison
would
not
be
upset
if
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
transferred
10,000
acres
to
the
anglican
church?
that
would
be
okay,
but
the
threepence
in
taxation
would
not?

the
second
announcement
is
in
hein
v.
freedom
from
religion
foundation,
inc,
number
06-157.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
seventh
circuit.
i’m
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
which
is
to
reverse
my
opinion
which
i
want
to
summarize
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy.
the
respondents
who
are
a
nonstock
corporation
and
several
of
its
members
filed
suit
in
federal
court
challenging
expenditures
made
pursuant
to
the
president’s
faith-based
and
community
initiatives
programs.
specifically
they
challenged
expenditures
that
paid
for
conferences
and
speeches
made
by
executive
branch
officials
claiming
that
the
conferences
and
speeches
singled
out
faith-based
organizations
as
being
particularly
deserving
of
federal
funding
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment’s
prohibition
against
the
establishment
of
religion.
the
challenged
expenditures
were
not
made
pursuant
to
any
act
of
congress
or
other
legislative
directive
rather
the
presidential
program
was
created
by
executive
order
and
the
challenged
activities
were
discretionary
executive
branch
expenditures
funded
out
of
general
appropriations.
the
petition
before
us
does
not
concern
the
merits
of
the
establishment
clause
challenge
but
rather
the
question
whether
respondents
had
standing
to
bring
their
claim
in
federal
court.
the
only
base
to
stay
asserted
for
standing
is
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
where
federal
taxpayers
and
that
federal
funds
were
used
to
fund
the
challenged
activities.
article
iii
of
constitution
imposes
a
standing
requirement
the
requirements
for
article
iii
standing
are
well
established.
“a
plaintiff
must
allege
a
personal
injury
that
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
defendant’s
allegedly
unlawful
conduct
and
that
is
likely
to
be
redressed
by
the
requested
relief.”
since
the
court
decided
frothingham
v.
mellon,
more
than
80
years
ago,
our
general
law
has
been
just
a
mere
fact
that
a
plaintiff
is
a
federal
taxpayer
who
challenges
a
federal
expenditure
does
not
give
rise
to
the
kind
of
personalized
injury
sufficient
to
create
article
iii
standing.
40
years
ago
this
court
fashioned
a
narrow
exception
to
the
general
law
against
taxpayers
standing
in
flast
v.
cohen
the
court
held
that
a
federal
taxpayer
could
challenge
an
expenditure
alleged
to
violate
the
establishment
clause
if
the
taxpayer
could
show
one
that
the
challenged
expenditure
wasn’t
exercise
of
congressional
power
under
the
constitution’s
taxing
and
spending
clause
and
two
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
the
plaintiff’s
taxpayer
status
and
the
precise
nature
of
the
constitutional
violation
alleged.
in
this
case
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
that
the
flast’s
exception
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
executive
branch
expenditures
challenged
below,
we
disagree.
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
found
federal
taxpayer-standing
including
flast
itself,
the
challenged
expenditures
will
made
pursuant
to
unexpressed
congressional
mandate
and
a
specific
congressional
appropriation.
in
this
case,
however,
there
was
neither
any
congressional
mandate
nor
any
specific
appropriation
for
the
challenged
activities.
thus,
the
required
nexus
between
the
expenditures
and
congress’
exercise
of
it’s
taxing
and
spending
powers
does
not
exist.
in
previous
cases
we
have
repeatedly
refused
to
extend
the
flast
decision
and
we
again
decline
to
extend
flast
today.
extending
flast
the
cases
involving
purely
executive
actions
would
raise
serious
separation
of
power’s
concerns
and
effectively
setup
the
federal
courts
as
continuing
monitors
of
the
constitutionality
of
merely
an
executive
branch
activities
including
every
speech
or
statement
ordered
by
an
executive
official
that
is
not
the
role
of
a
federal
judiciary.
justices
scalia
and
thomas
are
concur
in
the
judgment
would
go
further
and
overrule
flast
but
having
concluded
that
flast
by
its
terms
does
not
apply
to
the
activities
challenged
in
this
case.
we
have
no
occasion
to
reach
that
question
and
does
leave
flast
as
we
found
it
because
we
conclude
that
the
respondent’s
lack
article
iii
standing
the
judgment
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
