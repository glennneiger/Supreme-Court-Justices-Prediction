if
this...
if
congress
had
enacted
this
executive
order
that's
in
question
here,
if
it
had
been
congressional
legislation,
would
there
be
standing?

taxpayer
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would...
you've
covered
the
case
where
the
government
itself,
the
executive
is
the
actor
and
said
that's
not
covered
by
flast.
but
it
is
covered...
what
is
covered
is
if
the
give
the
money
directly
to
the
religious
organization.
if
the
money
goes
instead
of
to
the
government...
take
this
case,
if
the
conferences
are
run
by
a
private
contractor...
contractor
with
the
executive,
where
would
that
fall?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
claim,
these
conferences
are
run
now
instead
of
within
the
executive
branch
by
various
agencies,
they
are
run
by
contractors,
specialists
in
conferences
that
have
been
engaged
by
the
executive
to
help
people
make
grant
applications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
that's
a
question
on
the
merits.
right
now
we
have
to
take
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
on
the
merits
as...
the
allegation
is,
i
take
it,
that
religious
organizations
are
being
favored
over
secular
organizations;
but
that's
a
merits
question.
you've...
you've...
you
have
been
clear
that
if
the
government
itself
spends
the
money,
then
there's
no
standing.
you've,
you've
been
clear
that
if
it
gives
the
money
to
the
religious
group,
there
is
standing.
now
money
is
going
outside
the
government.
going
outside
the
government.
but
is
not
going
to
the
religious
organization.
where
do
you
fit
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
difference
was
that
it
was
because
it
was
under
the
property
clause,
and
made
a
distinction
between
property
and
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
are
talking
about
money,
not
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
it
just
a
ministerial
act
or
did
the
executive
have
discretion
involved,
about
who
would
receive
the
grant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
reconcile
valley
forge
simply
by
saying
when
it's
money
from
the
federal
treasury,
whether
it
is
a
general
appropriation
or
a
specific
appropriation,
it
is
money
from
the
treasury,
and
that's
what
flast
is
about.
because
whether
it
is
spent
by
the
executive
under
an
executive
program,
which
you
have
said
can
violate
the
establishment
clause
as
well
as
a
congressional
program.
so
why
isn't
that
the
line
to
draw
based
on
flast,
that
it's
money
from
the
treasury
that
makes
the
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
an
incidental
expenditure
as
part
of
a
regulatory
program
is
quite
different
from
looking
at
a
discrete
program.
the
faith-based
initiative
is
a
discrete
program,
and
one
component
of
it
is
this
set
of
conferences.
this
is
not
an
incidental
something
pursuant
to
a
large
regulatory
program.
faith-based
initiative
is
the
name
of
this
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pincus,
i
would
like
you
to
go
back
to
an
answer
you
gave
because
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
wasn't
right.
the
president
needs
protection
at
all
times
no
matter
where
he
goes.
the
president
may
be
doing
something
that
violates
the
establishment
clause,
but
protection
is
the
job,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
the
president
is.
and
so
your
answer
to
the
question,
well,
suppose
he
had
a
special
protector
who
just
took
care
of
his
religious
activities?
i
would
still
say
that
it's,
protection
is
the
thing.
so
i
don't
think...
i
think
you
didn't...
the
answer
you
gave
isn't
consistent
with
your
theory
of
this
case.
