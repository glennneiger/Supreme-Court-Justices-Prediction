chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-157,
hein
versus
freedom
from
religion
foundation.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
wouldn't
be
tax...
taxpayer
standing,
but
of
course
there
would
be
regular
article
iii
standing
in
the
sense
that
in
a
party
claiming
to
be
injured
because
they
didn't
get
a
grant,
and
a
religious
organization
did,
and
the
reason
was
religion,
can
bring
any
kind
of
claim
they
want
under
article
iii.
it's
just
they
wouldn't
qualify
for
the
special
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
there
is
no
taxpayer
standing
for
establishment
clause
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any,
presumably
any
other
denomination
that
is
not
of
the
established
church
could
bring
a
challenge
that
they're
being
discriminated
against,
because
they're
favoring
a
particular
church
over
them.
your
proposition
is
simply
that
somebody...
somebody
in
oregon
can't
challenge
the
fact
that
they're
building
a
church
in
florida
simply
because
the
person
in
florida
pays
taxes,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
that,
under
that
approach,
when
a
u.s.
marshal
executes
a
search
and
there's
a
fourth
amendment
claim
that
the
search
is
illegal,
that's
really
a
challenge
to
the
appropriation
of
the
marshals
service
on
an
as-applied
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's...
i
guess
that's
my
first
question.
i
don't
understand
under
your
theory
why
any
taxpayer
couldn't
sue
our
marshal
for
standing
up
and
saying
"god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
"
her
salary
comes
from
congress.
you
can
trace
that
under
your
traceability
requirement.
so
any
taxpayer
under
your
theory
could
bring
that
lawsuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
very...
i
can
identify
it.
it's
the
appropriations
that
congress
extends
to
this
court
that
pay
the
salary
of
the
marshal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
take
justice
breyer's
pilgrim
church.
under
your
theory,
if
the
grant
was
to
erect
a
memorial
and
suitable
museums
or
whatever
at
plymouth,
plymouth
rock,
then
there
wouldn't
be
an
identifiable
sum
if
the
government
said,
hey,
let's
use
some
of
this
money
to
build
a
church?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
government
singles
it
out.
by
that
you
mean
the
executive
who's
implementing
it,
as
opposed
to
congress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
they...
in
other
words,
if
they
spend
the
money
are
they
singling
it
out?
if
it
turns
out
it
costs
a
million
dollars
to
build
the
little
pilgrim
church
is
that
an
identifiable
sum
singled
out
that
would
satisfy
your
requirement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
grant,
just
that
you
can
say
it
costs
so
much
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
then
every
government
agency
has
to
make
sure
that
whatever
activities
they
undertake
are
part
of
a
broader
office?
they
don't
set
up
a
separate
white
house
office.
they
just
run
it
out
of
the
white
house
office.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
purely...
a
purely
formalistic
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would
decide
whether
it's
central
or
not.
if
you
have
a
white
house
office
of
faith-based
and
community
initiatives,
then
you
can
say
it's
central
to
it.
if
it's
just
the
white
house
office,
then
the
argument
would
be,
no,
that's
not
central.
they
do
a
lot
of
other
stuff
as
went.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
marshall
in
both--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we're
trying
to
decide
whether
it
is
central.
you
have
to
decide
what
unit
you're
looking
at
before
deciding
whether
the
activity
is
central.
and
you're
just
saying
well,
just
look
at
the
people
who
are
doing
the
offensive
activity,
and
it's
obviously
going
to
be
central
to
what
they're
doing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
justice
stewart
agreed
completely
with
what
the
court
said,
why
did
he
write
a
separate
opinion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
just
to
add
to
the
question,
before
you
answer,
at
the
jurisdictional
stage.
in
other
words,
this
would
be
litigation
over
whether
the
individual
taxpayer
has
standing.
the
court
would
first
have
to
determine
whether
the
activity
you're
challenging
is
incidental
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
they're
reading
flast
different
than
you
read
it.
there
are
not
a
lot
of
these
challenges
because
you
don't
have
standing
under
flast.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
would
happen
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well
then,
five
meetings
isn't
enough.
how
many?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
20?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again...
i
asked
this
before,
and
i
think
you
were
cut
off
before
you
had
a
chance.
incidental
with
respect
to
what?
all
of
the
money
for
a
particular
meeting,
a
particular
breakfast,
a
particular
whatever,
is
it
incidental
to
that,
or
is
it
incidental
to
however
many
times
the
president
has
breakfast
if
he
goes
to
a
prayer
breakfast?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
even
if
the
expenditure
is
very
small,
but
to
take
a
particular
religious
symbol
that
might
be
offensive
to
some
other
people,
is
that
incidental
because
the
meeting
went
on
longer
and
cost
more
than
the
particular
religious
symbol?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it
was
2
dollars,
you
would
say
it's
not
incidental
because
it
covered
the
whole
cost
of
purchasing
the
religious
symbol?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course.
but
the
point
is
that
makes--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
that
shows
how
totally
manipulable
your
incidental
test
is.
you
just
have
to
phrase
your
claim
so
that
it
covers
whatever
expenditure--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
offending
you.
it's
not...
incidental
doesn't
protect
you
from
frivolous
or
insignificant
claims
in
any
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
general
clement,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
