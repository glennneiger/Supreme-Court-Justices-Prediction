justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
the
same
question
as
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
was
also
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
question.
suppose
that
congress
passed
a
statute
that
said
we
hereby
appropriate
a
million
dollars
to
the
president
to
use
to
call
religious
conferences,
and
then
it
spelled
out
these
conferences.
is
there
standing
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
and
i
of
course
want
the
answer,
but
then,
why
is
that
consistent
with
what
you
told
us
at
the
beginning
that
there
had
to
be
a
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
one,
one
more
question
on
this,
on
this
line.
and
i
won't
belabor
the
hypothetical.
again
there's
a
federal
statute
for
this
conference,
and
the
moneys
go
for
air
tickets
to
various
religious
ministers
and
priests.
does
that
meet
your
outside
the
government
test
for
standing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
unduly
intrusive
for
the
courts
to
tell
the
president
that
it
cannot
talk
to
specific
groups
to
see
if
they
have
certain
talents
that
the
government
may
use
to
make
sure
that
all
of
their
energies
are
used
properly
by
the
federal
government.
it's
almost
like
a
speech
rationale.
and
perhaps
you
would
say
that's
just
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
standing
concern
here,
too,
that
we
would
be
supervising
the
white
house
and
what
it
can
say,
what
it
can...
who
it
can
talk
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
intrusive
from
the
standpoint
of
standing
purposes.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
makes
a
standard
that
distinguishes
the
case
from
flast
or
brings
it
within
those...
within
those
cases.
