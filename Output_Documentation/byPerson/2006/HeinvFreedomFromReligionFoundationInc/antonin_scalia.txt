justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
if
congress
enacts
a
program
that
favors
religion
over
non-religion,
which
is
supposedly
what
the
establishment
clause
prohibits,
that's
bad;
but
if
congress
enacts
a
perfectly
valid
general
program
and
the
president
implements
it
in
a
fashion
that
favors
religion
over
non-religion,
that's
okay,
insofar
as
the
ability
of
anybody
to
challenge
it
is
concerned.
is
that
an
accurate
description?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
if
the
government,
the
executive,
or
the
congress,
if
the
congressional
statute
authorizes
the
giving
of
money
for
the
billing
of
a
church,
that's
bad;
but
if
it
authorizes...
it
makes
a
general
authorization
to
the
president...
no.
if
the
congressional
statute
says
the
government
will
build
a
church,
that's
okay,
because
then
the
money
doesn't
go
outside
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
that
in
fact
it's
bad
in
the
first
situation
and
okay
in
the
second,
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
standing
for
the
internal
government
church?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we're
not
forcing
anybody
in
at
gunpoint.
we're
just
building
a
government
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we're
talking
taxpayer
standing.
and
you
think
there
is
a
real
difference
insofar
as
whether
the
taxpayer
is
harmed
between
the
congress
saying
we're
going
to
give
the
money
to
a
religious
organization
to
build
a
church
and
congress
saying
we're
going
to
build
a
church.
you
really
think
there's
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
both
cases
money
is
being
used
for
a
purpose
that
is
contrary
to
the
establishment
clause,
according
to
the
taxpayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
whether
it's
the
least
of
the
concerns,
it's
a
concern.
it's
the
same
establishment
clause
concern
in
both
cases.
now
you
may
well
be
correct
that
there's
a
freedom
of
religion
clause
violation
in
one
case
and
not
in
the
other,
but
as
far
as
the
establishment
clause
violation,
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not...
but
not
if
the
president
just
gives
the
money
out
of
a
general
appropriation,
authorizing
him
to
give
money
to
people
who
are
helping
in
the
programs
that
the
faith-based
initiative
was...
was
designed
to
help?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
president
hands
over
the
money,
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
why
not
necessarily?
i
thought
that
was
your...
you
proposition,
that
it
has
to
be
a
congressional
violation
not
an
executive.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
getting
the
money
from
congress
under
a
general,
under
a
general
appropriation.
if
he
takes
this
money
and
he
says
here,
use
it
for
a
religious
purpose,
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned,
he
can't
be
sued?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
say
so?
[laughter]
i...
i've
been
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to,
or
to
put
it
another
way,
to
put
justice
ginsburg's
point
another
way,
every
executive
action
that
involves
the
expenditure
of
congressionally
authorized
funds
is
an
as-applied
challenge
to
an
expenditure
statute.
because
the
only
way
the
statute
is
applied
is
through
executive
action.
and
whenever
the
executive
spends
the
funds
improperly,
you
have
an
as-applied
challenge
to
the
congressional
statute
authorizing
the
funds,
whether
it's
a
general
statute
or
a...
or
a
single
shot
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
essence
of
an
as-applied
challenge.
you
say
the
statute's
okay.
it
is
just
what
is
being
done
under
this
statute
that
is
bad.
you
don't
have
to
identify
a
bad
statute.
you're
saying
it
is
a
perfectly
good
statute,
but
the
president
is...
is
violating
the
constitution
in
the
way
that
he's
applying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
getting
upset
is
a
constitutionally
adequate
reason
to
bring
a
lawsuit?
if
people
get
upset
about
spending
money
for
purposes
that
the
federal
government
is
not
allowed
to
spend
money
for
because
of
states'
rights,
that
also
would
justify
article
iii
standing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
give
you
something
more
measurable.
it
is
easy
to
tell
from
time
sheets
and
other
things
how
much
money
is
expended
on
air
force
one
and
on
security
for
the
president
when
he
goes
to
address
a
religious
organization,
okay.
and
he
urges
the
importance
of
religion
in
american
life
and
so
forth.
the
whole
trip
is
about
religion.
that's
measurable.
would
a
taxpayer
have
standing
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
don't
understand.
the
money...
say
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
congress
has
to,
has
to
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
about
bowen?
the
money
wasn't
central
to
the
violation
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was,
you
know,
a
pregnancy
program
and
the
executive
added
to
it
certain,
certain
restrictions
that
were
challenged
as
being
religiously
based.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
allowed
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
a
specific
grant.
there
is
money
allocated
to
the
white
house
which
goes...
you
can
identify
it
in
the
budget,
and
some
of
it
goes
to
air
force
one.
some
of
it
goes
to
the
payment
of
the
security
guards.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
in
bowen
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
think...
there's
an
identified
sum
of
money
that
goes
to
pay
the
costs
of
air
force
one,
too,
to
buy
the
gas
and
everything
else.
there's
an
identified
sum
of
money
that
goes
into
the
pockets
of
the
security
guards
who
protect
the
president.
i
mean,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
contract
hiring
the
security
guards
who
protect
the
president,
right?
they're
employed.
that's
an
employment
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
protecting
him
for
a
religious
purpose.
he's
going
to
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
money
that
is
expended
in
order
to
enable
the
president
to
do
something
for
a
religious
purpose.
it
wouldn't
be
expended
but
for
the
fact
that
he
chose
to
make
this
religious
trip.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't,
it
wasn't
the
center
in
bowen
either.
the
center
in
bowen
was
programs
for...
to
combat
pregnancy.
and
some
of
the
organizations
that
were
getting
the
money
were
placing
conditions
on
it.
it
wasn't
central
to
the
program.
it
was
something
added
that
the
challenger
said
shouldn't
have
been
added.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
it
would
only
came
within
your
theory
if
there
was
one
secret
service
agent
who
was
assigned
to
religious
trips
of
the
president?
then
his
entire
salary
could
be
challenged.
but
if
it's
just
some
of
the
salary
of
a
secret
service
agent
who
protects
the
president
for
all
sorts
of
trips,
that
can't
be
challenged?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
point,
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
the
expenditure
in
bowen.
that
money
would
have
been
spent
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happened
to
have
been
spent
badly,
but
it
would
have
been
spent
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
her
point,
that
it
would
have
been
spent
differently.
if
the
president
hadn't
gone
to
this
religious
event,
he
would
have
gone
somewhere
else
and
the
money
would
have
been
spent
differently.
but
that
didn't
make
the
difference
in
bowen.
why
should
it
make
the
difference
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
is
it
was
spent
for
a
bad
purpose,
and
that's
the
essential
grievance
of
the
plaintiff,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
want
to
condemn
the
federal
courts
to
deciding
case
by
case
at
the
instance
of
all
these
people
who
feel
passionately
about
this,
case
by
case
whether
the
expenditure
was
incidental
or
not.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
an
intelligent
expenditure
of
any
sensible
person's
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
10?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
about
to
ask,
20.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
litigate
it.
we'll
figure
out
a
number
eventually,
i'm
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
problem
here
is
the
claim,
the
gravamen
here
is
the
government
is
doing
stuff
with
money
that's
been
taxed
from
me
that
it
shouldn't
do.
i
fail
to
see
how
it
makes
any
difference
to
the
people
who
care
so
passionately
about
this,
as
justice
breyer
suggests,
whether
it's
just
an
incidental
expenditure
or
whether
it's
part
of
a
targeted
program.
we
don't
do
that
in
any
other
area
of
constitutional
law.
if
someone
has
been
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
we
don't
say
well,
you
know,
it
was
just
incidental.
yeah,
we
know
you
feel
badly
about
it,
but
this
was
just
an
incidental
search
and
seizure,
and
you
don't
have
standing.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
given
the
gravamen
that
you're
directing
this
law
against,
to
establish
such
a
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
also
acknowledge
we're
not
here
to
try
to
make
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
standing
to
challenge
a
presidential
directive
which
says
we
are
going
to
buy
bagels
for
all
evangelistic
christian
breakfasts.
[laughter]
okay?
but
not
for
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
there
be
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
confer
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
standing
by
joe
doaks,
not
from
somebody
who's
starting
a
jewish
prayer
breakfast
and
says,
you
know,
what
could
be
worse
than
not
buying
bagels
for
a
jewish
prayer
breakfast.
[laughter]
with
him
i
could
understand,
he
has
standing.
but
i'm
just
talking
about
one
of
these
many
people
who
feel
passionately
about
this
just
in
general.
you
walk
in
and
say
he
can't
do
this
because
i'm
a
taxpayer,
and
you
say
i'm
sorry,
being
a
taxpayer
is
not
enough,
we
don't
care
how
passionately
you
feel
about
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
not
the
same
money
used.
it's
not
the
same
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
into
some
pot
of
fungible
money
and
it's
other
money
used.
so
instead
of
using
other
money,
you
use
land.
does
that
make
a
difference?
