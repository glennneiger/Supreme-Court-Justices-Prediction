and
why
should
that
make
any
difference
if
the
entire
theory
behind
it
is
sort
of
a
madisonian
theory,
if
not
threepence
from
the
pocket
for
a
religious
purpose?
if
you
start
with
the
madisonian
view,
there
should
be
no
distinction
of
the
two
cases
that
justice
scalia
puts.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's
talk
about
establishing...
maybe
this
is
what
you're
going
to
do,
establishing
religion
by
spending
the
threepence.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
this
case,
when
you
build
the
church,
you're
spending
the
threepence
whether...
whether
a...
a
government
employee
is
laying
the
bricks
or
a
contract...
an
outside
contractor
is
laying
the
bricks
or
a
third
party
institution
to
which
a
grant
has
been
made
is
laying
the
bricks.
it's
the
same
threepence.
justice
david
h.
souter
taking
the
money
out
of
the
pocket
and
using
it
for
a
particular
purpose,
and
the
money
comes
out
of
the
pocket
in
each
case.
the
purpose
is
the
same
in
each
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pincus,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
think
your
theory
is
consistent
with
valley
forge?
