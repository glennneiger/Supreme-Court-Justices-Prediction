mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
flast
needs
major
surgery
and,
as
the
discussion
i
think
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument
shows,
it's
proposing
two
very
substantial
limitations
that
bear
no
relation
to
the
relevant
establishment
clause
principles,
the
history
of
the
clause,
or
the
history
of
this
court's
decisions.
and
we
think
there's
no
basis
for
drawing
the
arbitrary
lines
that
the
government
suggests.
and
maybe
i
can
follow
up
on
some
of
the
points
that
my
colleague
made
and
that
the
court
made
during
the
questioning.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
money
has
to
go
outside
the
government.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
this
court's
cases
that
say
that
and
the
lower
courts
and
this
court
at
least
in
part
have
found
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
the
salaries
paid
to
chaplains
that
are
employed
by
the
government,
and
of
course
those
would
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
lawsuit
could
be
brought,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
let
me
explain
why.
we
think
that
the
limitations
that
are
in
this
court's
opinions
require
the
taxpayer
to
identify
a
discrete
and
identifiable
non-incidental
expenditure.
in
other
words,
it's
not
just
any--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but,
your
honor,
those
appropriations
don't
do
the
trick,
and
maybe
i
can
just
explain
our
test
and
explain
why.
the
court
in
doremus
explained
why
there
was
standing
in
everson
to
challenge
the
payments
for
bus
transportation
by
saying
everson
showed
a
measurable
appropriation
or
disbursement
of
school
district
funds
occasioned
solely
by
the
activities
complained
of.
in
other
words,
there
has
to
be
some...
the
violation
caused
some
unique
expenditure.
not
that
the
moneys
wouldn't
have
been
expended,
because
in
this
context
the
taxpayer
doesn't
have
to
show
a
lower
tax
burden,
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
there
was
a
tie
between...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
and
this
court
has
said
and
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
that
is
not
the
requirement,
because
the
injury
here
that
the
taxpayer
complains
of,
as
the
court
said
in
daimler
chrysler,
is
not
an
increased
tax
burden.
the
injury
is
the
expenditure
of
funds
in
a
way
that
violates
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
the
court
said
in
doremus
in
describing
everson.
it
didn't
say
the
mere
fact
that
some
money
being
spent
was
enough.
it
said
that
there
was
a
measurable
appropriation
or
disbursement
occasioned
solely
by
the
activities
complained
of.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
so,
because,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
that
this
court
has
identified
a
second
limitation,
which
is
not
incidental.
the
money
has
to
be
central...
the
money
that's
being
challenged
has
to
be
central
to
the
violation.
just
as
you
couldn't
challenge
a
prayer
breakfast--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
money
has
to
be
central
to
the
violation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
it
can
be...
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
challenge
is
that
these
conferences
were...
the
entire
conference
program
was
a
program
to
further
religion
over
non-religion.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--you
did,
an
as-replied
challenge
to
the
specific
grants.
but
there
were
specific
grants
identified
and
there
was
an
as-applied
challenge.
but
the
argument
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
money
that's
identified
in
the
budget
is
not...
well,
it's
not
the
entire
air
force
one
appropriation
that
would
be
challenged
in
the
kind
of
claim
you're
talking
about.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
it
was
a
specific...
there
was
a
specific
action
that
allocated
a
specific
amount
of
money
to
those
grantees.
and
the
argument
was
those
grantees
weren't
entitled
to
any
of
that
money
because
the
way
they
were
using
it
violated
the
establishment
clause.
and
so
there
was...
the
government's
own
action
by
designating
a
specific
sum
of
money
in
that
grant
identified
a
specific
sum
of
money,
and
the
challenge
was
to
that
entire
expenditure
as
identified
by
the
government.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
i
think,
as
i
say,
there
are
two
tests.
one
is
whether
there's
an
identifiable
sum.
we
were
talking
about
with
respect
to
grants
are
the
easiest
case.
there's
another
case
as
when
there's
a
challenge
to
an
entire
program
that
the
government
has
identified
as
a
particular
program.
and
then
the
question,
the
second
question
that
the
court
has
identified
in
flast,
was
is
it
incidental
or
not.
is
it
something
that
is
peripheral--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
the
government
then
singled
out
some
of
that
money--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
don't
think
the
singling
out...
i
don't
think
whether
it's
discrete
and
identifiable
depends
on
the
amount,
your
honor.
i
think
it
depends
on
how...
whether
there
is
a
way...
and
this
really
is
part
of
both
traceability
and
redressability.
there
has
to
be
a
way
to
identify
the
expenditure
that
the
taxpayer
is
seeking
to
enjoin.
and
if
there
is
some
separate
government
grant
for
the
building
of
a
church,
yes,
if
it's...
if...
if
there
is
some
religious--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--or
a
contract.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
the
government
let
the
contract
for
the
building
of
the
church,
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
they
are,
and
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
they're
protecting
him
for
a
protection
purpose.
his
trip
is
for
a
religious
purpose.
and
i
think
our
submission
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
there.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but...
but,
as
with
buying
the
bagels
at
a
prayer
breakfast,
the
cost
of
the
bagels,
like
the
cost
of
the
security,
is
not...
is
not
paying
for
the
center
of
what
the
violation
is.
and
therefore
we
think
that
that's
the
basis
for
a
rule
that
rules
those
types
of
expenditures
out.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
their
claim
was
that
the
spending
of
this
entire
grant
is
unconstitutional
because
of
the
way
the
money
is
going
to
be
used
by
the
grantees.
it
wasn't
that
$1.98
of
the
is
unconstitutional
and
the
other
million
dollars
is
okay.
it
was
that
because
of
the
way
the
grantee
was
using
the
money,
the
entire
grant
is
unconstitutional.
we
think
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
and
we
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
does
make
sense
because,
unlike
the
government's
limitations,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
rationale
of
flast
or
the
underlying
threepence
here
of
james
madison,
that
does...
that
is
a
particular
amount
of
money
that
the
government
is
spending
and
it's
identifiable
just
because
of
religion.
we
think
that
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
they
may--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
preserves--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
but
if
there
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
there
are
particular
people
in
that
office
for
a
particular,
separately
called
out
program
in
that
office
that
is
focused
on
faith-based
initiatives
only,
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
i
think
i
haven't
been
clear
in
the
test
that
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
that's
because
there
are
two
steps
to
our
analysis,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is,
is
there
a
discrete
and
identifiable
expenditure
that
only
arises
with
respect
to
religious
activities.
the
second
question
is,
does
that
particular
expenditure,
is
that
particular
expenditure
an
incidental
one?
flast
said
incidental
expenditures
don't
give
rise
to
standing.
and
i
think
you're
right
in
that
situation,
that
expenditure--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
question--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
it
would
have
been
spent
differently,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
the
critical--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
agree
completely.
but
we
also
agree
that
there
are
some
limits
that...
the
court
has
said
that
every
single
dollar
that's
expended
for
a
bad
purpose
doesn't
give
rise
to
a
challenge.
my
example,
if
there's
a
prayer
breakfast
and
all...
the
only
money
that's
spent
is
on
the
bagels,
we
don't
believe
the
bagels
are
the
basis
for
a
taxpayer
challenge
to
the
prayer
breakfast.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
respectfully,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
justice
stewart
said.
justice
stewart
in
his
concurrence
did
not
espouse
a
broader
theory
than
the
one
that
the
court
adopted
in
flast.
and
he
said
he
joined
the
judgment,
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
he
said,
i
understand
that
to
hold
only
that
a
federal
taxpayer
has
standing
to
assert
that
a
specific
expenditure
of
federal
funds
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
i
think
it's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
in
the...
sometimes
despite
the
court's
desire
sometimes
to
have
a
less
separate
opinion,
sometimes
justices
do.
and
what
he
said
here
is
he
was
just
explaining
his
reason
why
he
believed
that
flast
was
distinguishable
from
frothingham,
and
notes
specifically
that
taxpayers
have
a
clear
stake
because
of
the
threepence
comment.
justice
fortas
did
say,
did
have
a
broader
theory,
although
he...
in
addition,
that
the
court
did
not
adopt...
but
he
also
said,
recognizing
very
similar
language
to
justice
stewart,
what
the
court's
opinion
held.
so
i
think
justice
stewart's
opinion
is
useful
because
he
doesn't
talk
about
congress,
he
talks
about
expenditures.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
incidental
test,
and
what
i've
been
talking
about
in
terms
of
what
the
limits
are,
that
it
has
to
be
a
non-incidental
expenditure
protects
against
that.
because
if
the
argument
is
that
some
government
official,
for
part
of
his
day
met
with
three
ministers,
and
therefore
we
want
to
challenge
because
government
shouldn't
be
meeting
with
ministers,
i
think
it's
both
for
the
reason,
both
because
of
the
fact
this
is
not
an
argument
that
the
expenditure
on
the
hours
of
the
day
it
took
to
have
those
meetings
is
clearly
not
central
to
anything.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fact
that
there
hasn't
been
a
lot
of
these
challenges
that
the
government
has
been
able
to
point
to,
indicates
that
this
may
not
be
a
big
problem.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
the
court
also
said
in
allen
against
wright,
you
know,
the
absence
of
precise
standards
does
not
leave
the
courts
at
sea
in
applying
the
law
of
standing.
standing
isn't
an
area,
really,
that
is
susceptible
to
precise
definitions.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
because
of
the
incidental
test
and
the
concerns
that
justice
kennedy
articulated,
if
someone's
claim
is
that
people
in
the
white
house
have
five
meets
in
the
course
of
a
year
that
they're
upset
about,
it
does
not
take
much
at
the
jurisdictional--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--even
if
it's
true...
even
if
it's
true--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
our
position--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
you
know,
in
allen
against
wright,
and
linda
r.f.,
there
are
a
whole
series
of
cases
where
this
court
has
set
up
guidance,
and
the
lower
courts
have
evaluated
whether
the
connection
between
the
challenged
conduct
and
the
claimed
injury...
here
the
expenditure...
is
close
enough
for
there
to
be
standing.
and
this...
the
inquiry
that
we're
suggesting
really
isn't
that
different.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
their
challenge
was
that
the
entire...
the
whole
program
essentially,
as
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
the
complaint
here,
the
whole
program
essentially
is
facially
neutral,
but
in
reality
is
a
preference,
yes.
then
it
would
come
out
the
same
way
and
the
question
would
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
that's
true
in
many
standing
questions.
the
question
is,
how
do
you
characterize
the
claim?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
it
is
a
standard
that
the
court
established
in
flast.
it
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
i
actually
think
the
court's
precedents
line
up
pretty
neatly.
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
you
want
a
way
to
keep
them
out--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--exactly.
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
our
submission
is
that
it
does,
your
honor,
because
we
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
incidental
to
what...
what's
the
focus
of
the
claim?
the
focus
of
the
claim
isn't
that
bagels
were
served.
the
focus
of
the
claim
is
there
was
prayer
and
that
it
was
a
religious
meeting.
if
there
was...
just
to
think
of
what
such
a
claim
might
be.
and
so
the
expenditure
that...
that's
been
identified
is
the
bagels,
it
really
is
pretty
tangential
compared
to
the
focus
of
what
someone's
complaining
about.
and
so
we
think
that's
a
rational
test
for
doing
what
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
i
think
there
probably
there
would
be
two
challenges,
because
there
would
be
a
challenge
to
the
government's
purchase
of
the
religious
symbol
to
have
at
the
meeting
in
addition
to
the
meeting,
and
i
think
then--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
this...
and
i
think
the
government
agrees
with
this.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
test
about
how
much.
i
think
this
is
a
test
about
the
relationship
between
the
expenditure
that's
challenged
and
the
claim,
what's
alleged
to
be
unlawful
this
complex
of
government
activity.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
i
think
there
would
be
standing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
there
the
challenge
is
to
the
discriminatory
purchase.
it's
not
about
the
prayer
breakfast,
it's
about
the
idea
that
the
government
is
purchasing
bagels
in
a
religiously
discriminatory
way.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
so
there
absolutely
would
be
standing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
i
think
it
does,
because
there
would
have
to
be
an
allegation
in
that
situation
that
bagels
were
being
purchased
on
a
religious
basis,
and
that's
going
to
be
awfully
hard
for
a
lawyer
to
sign
in
good
faith.
i
think
the
problem,
if
i
may--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
purchase...
the
idea
that
bagels
are
being
purchased
only
for
evangelicals
and
not
for
jewish
breakfasts?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
the
government--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
don't
think
general
passion
is
enough.
i
think
what
the
court
said
is
there
has
to
be
a
tie-in,
and
let
me
say
that
i
think
what's
critical
here
is
any
test
obviously
is
susceptible
to
hypotheticals,
but
the
government...
our
test
at
least
keeps
in
taxpayer
standing
the
core
of
what
the
framers
were
worried
about,
which
is
government
expenditure
of
funds--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do,
because
in
valley
forge,
first
of
all,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
the
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
property
clause
claim.
there
is
a
passage
in
valley
forge
that
refers
to
executive
action,
but
the
court
in
kendrick
when
it
talked
about
valley
forge
said,
in
characterizing
that
case,
said
executive
action
pursuant
to
the
property
clause.
and
we
think
those
things
are
tied
together
and
there's
a
reason
why.
in
the
appropriations
context,
there
always
is
congressional
action
with
respect
to
the
very
money
that's
at
issue
because
there
has
to
be
a
congressional
appropriation.
that's
not
true
in
the
property
context.
congress
doesn't
have
to
say,
pass
a
statute
to
say,
here
are
the
58
property
sites
that
we
want
the
executive
to
get
rid
of.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
that
the
core
of
what
was
the
concern
was...
was
the
taking
of
the
money
and
the
using
it
for
religious
purposes.
and
i
think
what
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
it's
not
the
same
money.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
that
the
court
decided
that
it
made
a
difference,
and
i
think
in
terms
of
cabining,
in
terms
of
the
worry
that
perhaps
flast
is
going
to
be
overbroad
and
the
need
to
have
congress
involved,
which
i
think
is
key...
there
was
no
congressional
involvement
at
all
in
designating
those
properties
and
there
is
in
the
appropriations
context,
and
i
think
that's
a
key
difference.
but
i
think
what's
important
here,
and
the
court's
colloquy
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument
showed
me
this...
but
the
government's
position,
the
idea
that
it's
only
grants
to
third
parties...
the
government
could
hire
a
corps
of
chaplains
and
send
them
out
to
civilians
and
to
the
populace
at
large
and
that
couldn't
be
challenged,
because
all
it
is
is
executive
pay;
and
the
idea
that
there's
some
difference
between
a
bowen
v.
kendrick
situation,
where
the
executive
had
tremendous
discretion
in
terms
of
where
it
was
going
to
give
the
money,
and
the
situation
here,
which
is
the
exercise
of
precisely
the
same
executive
discretion,
makes
no
sense.
the
injury
is
the
same.
the
conduct
that's...
that's
the
core
of
the
violation
is
the
same.
it's
an
executive
branch
decision
to
use
funds
in
a
way
that's
impermissible
under
the
establishment
clause,
and
we've
been
drawing
the
lines
that
the
government
has
been
trying
to
draw
just
makes
no
sense,
and
to
leave
out,
to
insulate
from
any
taxpayer
challenge
really
huge
swaths
of
conduct
that
is
really
at
the
very
core
of
what
madison
was
concerned
about.
so
our
submission
is
that
that
really
makes
no
sense.
there's
no
basis
in
history,
for
example,
for
the
government's
claim
that
executive
branch
decisions
are
somehow
different
and
insulated
with
respect
to
spending.
it's
the
spending
of
the
same
threepence,
and
if
history
indicates
anything
it's
that
concerns
about
establishment
were
focused
just
as
much
on
the
king
as
on
the
parliament
in
terms
of
the
history
that
the
framers
understood.
and
for
the
idea
that
the
executive
would
be
given
free
rein
to
exercise
discretion
with
respect
to
spending
and
there
would
be
no
concern
about
the
types
of
injuries
that
gave
rise
to
flast
we
think
is
just
not
right.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
