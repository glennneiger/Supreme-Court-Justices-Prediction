mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
flast
against
cohen,
this
court
recognized
narrow
circumstances
in
which
a
taxpayer
could
satisfy
the
requirements
of
article
iii
in
challenging
a
congressional
exercise
of
its
spending
and
taxing
authority.
this
court
in
doing
so
rejected
the
suggestion
of
justice
douglas
that
it
allow
all
taxpayers
to
sue
in
all
manner
of
claims,
as
well
as
the
slightly
more
modest
suggestion
of
justices
stewart
and
fortas
that
the
court
allow
taxpayer
standing
for
all
establishment
clause
challenges.
this
court's
subsequent
cases
such
as
valley
forge
have
made
clear
just
how
narrow
the
rule
of
flast
is.
in
order
for
a
taxpayer
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
article
iii,
the
taxpayer
must
challenge
a
congressional
exercise
of
the
taxing
and
spending
authority,
and
assert
that
the
act
of
spending
itself
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
establishment
clause
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
decision
below
substantially
expanded
the
scope
of
taxpayer
standing
and
in
doing
so,
the
court
adopted
a
doctrine
that
i
think
can
fairly
be
only
understood
as
an
exception
to,
not
an
application
of
normal
principles
of
article
iii
standing.
the
court
did
so
on
the
rationale
that
there
is
much
that
the
executive
branch
can
do
to
violate
the
establishment
cause,
but
there
is
much
that
all
three
branches
of
government
could
conceivably
do
to
violate
the
establishment
clause,
and
that
has
never
been
thought
a
sufficient
reason
to
extend
taxpayer
standing
to
all
government
action,
nor
has
it
been
thought
a
sufficient
reason
to
relax
the
irreducible
minimum
requirements
of
article
iii.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
think
that
may
be
sort
of
over
inclusive
and
under
inclusive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
which
is
to
say,
it's
not
a
congressional
program,
it's
a
congressional
spending
statute
that
is
the
key
predicate.
and
then
once
there's
a
congressional
spending
program,
whether
it's
facial
challenge
or
an
as-apply
challenge
that
relies
on
an
intervening
ministerial
act
of
the
executive
branch,
taxpayer
standing
will
lie
under
this
court's
precedent.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg,
but
let
me
just
be
clear.
i
don't
think
it's
just
a
matter
of
this
executive
order
that's
challenged
in
this
case
and
congress
could
have
enacted
that
into
statute.
as
i
understand
it,
the...
what
is
really
at
issue
here
is
not
the
executive
order.
it
is
the
way
that
certain
conferences
were
conducted
by
executive
branch
officials.
that's
what
the
dispute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
look
at
this
court's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
there
has
to
be
two
things.
there
has
to
be
a
statute.
and
then
there
has
to
be
an
allegation
that
the
statute
creates
a
unique
injury
in
the
context
of
spending
that
affects
taxpayers
differently
than
anybody...
than
any
other
citizen.
and
if
you
have
a
situation
like
your
hypothetical
statue,
where
you
don't
have
any
spending
that
goes
outside
of
the
government,
then
you
might
have
an
establishment
clause
problem,
but
it
wouldn't
be
an
establishment
clause
problem
where
the
nub
of
the
problem
is
the
fact
that
money
is
spent.
because
if
there's
a
problem
with
what's
going--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
importantly,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
a
matter
of
it
being
okay.
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
logically--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yeah,
it
logically
gives
rise
to
taxpayer
standing.
so...
and
i
think
there
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
i
would
say
is
in
either
case
it's
bad.
i
would
say
that
there
is
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
the
disbursement
of
funds
outside
the
government
but
not
your
horrible
hypothetical
about
an
internal
government
church.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
taxpayer
standing.
anybody
who's
subjected
to
the
mass
at
the
church
probably
has
standing
as
a
matter
of
direct--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
nobody
forced
van
orden
to
walk
by
the
ten
commandments
display
in
texas
at
gunpoint,
and
yet
this
court
said
that
he
could
bring
an
establishment
clause
challenge.
so
i
think
there
would
be
directly
injured
people
who
could
challenge
your
sort
of
end
of
the
slippery
slope--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
there's
a
difference
in
the
extent
to
which
there
is
a
conceptually
direct
injury
for
the
taxpayer
as
taxpayer.
the
citizens
are
clearly
injured
when
the
government
sets
up
the
church.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
with
respect,
in
the
context
of
the
internal
government
church,
the
fact
that
money
is
being
spent
to
establish
that
church
is
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--least
of
your
concerns.
it's
the
fact
that
the
government
is
establishing
it
that's
the
principal
concern.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
a
difference
suggested
by
this
court's
cases,
and
they
do
make
an
important
distinction
between
the
distribution
of
money
outside
the
government
where
the
spending
itself
is
the
injury
and
what
this
court
has
termed
the
incidental
expenditure
of
money
in
the
context
of
an
executive
branch
activity
that
itself
is
alleged
to
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
quite
sure
that's
right,
justice
souter,
because
i
think
that
there's
really
two
ways
the
government
can
establish
religion.
one
is
they
can
do
it
themselves
directly.
and
if
they
do
that,
i
think
that
the
primary
problem
is
the
primary
executive
branch
conduct
in
doing
so.
the
other
way
they
can
establish--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly.
and
that
is
precisely
what--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect
in
the
one
respect
it
is
the
three
pence
itself
that
is
the
establishment
violation.
it
is
the
act
of
handing
government
money
into
the
coffers--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
i
would
take
issue
with
that
and
say
the
primary
concern
that
madison
was
focused
on
was
the
taking
of
the
money
and
then
giving
it
to
the
outside
religious
entity.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
might
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
actually.
if
the
nature
of
the
claim--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
think
the
better
view,
is
the
challenge
is
exactly
this
one,
which
is
not
that
there's
something
wrong
with
the
recipient,
but
that
there's
something
wrong
with
what
goes
on
at
these
conferences.
then
in
that
context,
i
don't
think
there
would
be...
standing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
i
think
if
i
understand
the
question,
i
would
say
that
there's
no
taxpayer
standing
there.
and
i
think...
but,
but
and
i
apologize
for
sort
of
bleeding
over
into
the
merits.
but
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
you
can
really
meaningfully
talk
about
the
flast
nexus
test
without
bleeding
over
a
little
bit
into
the
merits,
because
the
court
did
it
itself
in
flast.
and
what
i
would
say
is
if
you
have
a
challenge
where
the
problem
is
that
it's
the
very
act
of
money
going
to
the
third
party
conference
organizers
that's
the
problem,
then
it
really
is
a
spending
case,
and
i
think
the
taxpayer
standing
would
logically
lie.
but
if
it's
really,
what
the
concern
here
is
the
primary
conduct
of
what
was
done
at
the
conferences,
and
not
the
fact
that
there's
spending
on
the
conferences
at
all,
then
i
think
it's
more...
it
is
a
case
there
would
not
be
taxpayer
standing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right.
and
it's
a
very
important
point.
because
for
example,
when
this
court
recognized
that
the
bible
reading
in
doremus
did
not
give
rise
to
taxpayer
standing,
that
didn't
stop
the
parents
who
were
directly
injured
by
the
same
practice
in
shemp
from
bringing
an
establishment
clause--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
there
would
be
taxpayer
standing
if
i
understand
that.
and
i
realize
that,
you
know,
one
could
say
well,
that's
is
a
fairly
artificial
distinction.
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
suggested
by
this
court's
precedents
and
the
reason
that
it
makes
sense
is
that
when
you
have
injury...
where
the
real
injury
is
the
spending,
the
fact
that
you're
not
supposed
to
pay
for
plane
tickets
for
ministers,
that's
an
establishment
clause
injury,
then
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
people
that
provided
that
money
in
the
in
the
first
place
have
a
distinct
injury.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
necessarily,
justice
scalia,
but
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
and
it
would
depend
a
little
bit
on
about
where
the
president
is
getting
the
money.
i
think
the
way
that
we
would
look
at
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--he--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
he,
if
he's
taking
it
from
a
general
appropriation
that
makes
no
indication
it's
to
go
outside
the
government
so
one
could
not
in
any
way
articulate
that
as
an
as-applied
challenge
to
the
appropriations,
then
i
suppose
that
there
would
not
be
standing.
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
say
that
that's
a
much
harder
case
than
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
say
no.
i
would
say
no,
no.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
what
flast
makes
clear
is
that
you
can
challenge
a
congressional
statute
that
is
a
taxing
and
spending
statute.
and
i
think
to
understand
the
circumstances
in
which
you
should
give
rise
to
taxpayer
standing,
you
need
two
things:
you
need
a
congressional
statute
that
is
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
and
spending
authority;
but
then
you
need
the
money
to
go
outside
the
government.
and
that's
precisely
what--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
because
there's,
again,
there's
two
ways--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--horrible
hypothetical.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
i
think
the
bottom
line
is
that
there
would
not
be
taxpayer
standing.
plenty
of
people
could
probably
challenge
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
probably--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly,
and
not
just
the
person
in
oregon.
but
everybody
in
between
oregon
and
florida
all
have
the
same
amount
of
standing.
no,
what
we're
saying
is
plenty
of
people
would
be
able
to
challenge
that.
but
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as...
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
i
think
anybody
from
a
different
denomination
that
said
that
this
was
discriminatory
probably
could
bring
a
claim.
i
also
think
that
anybody
who
walked
into
one
of
those
churches
could
bring
a
claim.
and
again,
this
court...
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
we--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect...
with
respect,
justice
breyer,
i
think
you're
underestimating
the
ingenuity
of
plaintiffs
to
think
that
somebody
that
walked
by
going
to
plymouth
rock
okay
thinking
i
was
going
to
see
a
nice
historical
exhibit,
and
is
and
to
see
a
church,
wouldn't
bring
a...
an
action.
and
that
there
wouldn't
be
article
iii
standing
for
that
particular
individual,
not
the
taxpayer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
latter,
justice
alito.
[laughter]
and
i
appreciate...
i
appreciate
the
question.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and
i've
been
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
this
court's
precedents.
[laughter]
and
the
best
that
i
can
do...
the
best
that
i
can
do,
when
i
put
together
flast--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think...
as
a
matter
of
first
course,
the
court
tries.
and
here...
if
i
could
put
the
precedents
on
the
map,
though,
i
do
think
they
make
a
modicum
of
sense
in
the
following
way.
you
start
with
flast.
flast
says
that
you
can
bring
a
challenge
to
a
congressional
spending
statute.
okay,
fair
enough.
valley
forge
comes
along
and
says
that
you,
that
you
don't
have
taxpayer
standing
to
challenge
an
executive
branch
action.
now
that
raises
a
very
obvious--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
justice
ginsburg,
in
fairness,
the
court
could
not
have
been
more
clear
in
valley
forge
that
there
were
two
reasons
that
there
weren't
taxpayer
standing
there.
one
was
there
was
a
challenge
to
executive
branch
action.
the
second
was
that
it
was
the
property
clause
rather
than
the
spending
clause.
now,
you
could
sort
of
take
the
view
that
the
third
of
the
cases,
kendrick,
overrules
the
first
aspect
of
the
decision
in
valley
forge.
now
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
the
way
to
understand
kendrick
is
as
follows:
you
have
a
decision
that
says
you
can...
you
can
challenge
congressional
spending,
not
executive
branch
action.
that
naturally
poses
the
question
what
about
an
as-applied
challenge
to
a
spending
statute?
surely,
i
mean,
because
spending
is
something
only
the
congress
does,
and
disbursement
is
a
ministerial
act
that
only
the
executive
does,
what
do
you
do
when
there's
an
intervening
ministerial
act
of
disbursement?
does
that
mean
that
it's
still
an
as-applied
challenge
to
the
spending
statute?
or
does--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
mean
that
it's
executive
branch
action?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
two
things.
one,
in
bowen,
there
was...
there
is
certainly
always
a
degree
of
discretion.
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
bowen
as
in
flast,
the
statute
itself
on
its
face
made
clear
that
money
was
to
go
to
outside
entities
that
were
religious.
in
bowen
it
did
so
in
express
terms
by
four
times
referring
to
religious
organizations.
in
flast
it
did
so
by
saying
money
was
going
to
go,
or
in-kind
aid,
rather,
was
to
going
to
go
to
private
schools.
and
that
was
at
a
time
when
this
court
roughly
contemporaneously,
in
lemon
v
kurtzman
that
93
percent
of
the
private
schools
were
religious.
the
both
of
those,
the
gravamen
of
what's
the
complaint,
that
money
is
being
spent
by
congress
on
religious
entities,
was
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
executive
branch.
and
again,
the
way
i
would
understand
kendrick
is
simply
reconciling
valley
forge
and
flast
and
cohen
to
preserve,
not
broad
challenges
to
executive
branch
action,
which
would
have
overruled
valley
forge,
but
rather
to
simply
preserve
the
notion
that
you
can
bring
an
as-applied
challenge
to
a
spending
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
certainly
not
the
line
i
would
draw
from
reading
these
cases
side
by
side
and
together.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
i
would
have
said
that
no
one
would
have
conceptualized
that
as
an
as-applied
challenge
to
a
general
appropriation
statute.
i
mean,
i
guess
you
would.
but
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--even,
even
if
you
would
do
that
in
another
case,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
do
it
in
this
case.
if
you
look
at
their
complaint
they
don't
identify
a
single
appropriation
statute
that
they
take
issue
with.
even
before
the
tenth...
the
seventh
circuit,
if
you
look
at
page
10
a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i've
never
heard
of
an
as-applied
challenge
to
a
statute
that
doesn't
identity
that's
unconstitutional
as
applied.
and
it's
your
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
every
constitutional
right
could
be
sort
of
transmogrified
into
a
claim
that
oh,
that's
an
as-applied
appropriations
challenge,
because
the
government's
not
supposed
to
spend
money
to
do
unlawful
things.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely.
i
mean,
if
this
court
wants
to
go
the
route
of
justice
stewart,
which
it
pointedly
rejected,
the
majority
of
the
court
pointed
rejected
in
flast,
and
say,
establishment
clause
challenges,
we're
going
to
relax
the
normal
article
iii
standard...
now,
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
the
court
gets
the
authority
to
relax
the
normal
article
iii
standards.
but
assuming
that,
that
would
at
least
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
suppose
under
that
theory,
and
obviously
the
plaintiffs
in
richardson
and
schlesinger
were
very
upset
as
well,
and
the
court
said
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
breyer,
let
me
try
to
answer
in
two
ways
if
i
can.
one
is
to
say
that
that
way
of
looking
at
it
takes
you
even
beyond
where
justice
brennan
was
in
valley
forge.
even
justice
brennan
would
have
drawn
the
line
at
what
he
called
bestowals
of
government
largesse
to
third
parties.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
but
he--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
again,
he
didn't
say
just
spending
of
money
to
do
the
executive
branch's
everyday
operations
and
maybe...
and
one
day
they
go
a
little
too
far
in
praising
religion.
he
said
bestowal
of
government
largesse
outside
the
government.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
i
still
don't
understand
where
in
just
being
upset
you
satisfy
the
irreducible
minimum
requirements
of
article
iii,
and
even
though
flast
is
probably
the
outer
limit
of
what's
an
article
iii
injury
under
normal
principles,
there
is
at
least
what
judge
leventhal
in
public
citizen
against
simon
called
conceptual
directness
between
the
injury
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
injury
that
comes
when
tax
money
is
spent
outside
the
government
to
a
religious
entity.
he
differentiated
that
from
what
happens
when
you
have
general
executive
branch
activity
that's
unlawful,
where
he
said
there's
no
similar
arrow
between
the
action
and
taxpayers
as
a
class.
it's
a
classic
injury
that's
inflicted
on
everybody.
it's
a
generalized
grievance,
which
has
never
been
said
to
satisfy
article
iii.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
justice
ginsburg,
their
challenge
is
not
that
the
money
that's
spent
on
conferences
can't
be
spent
on
conferences.
their
challenge
is
that
what
happened
at
the
conference
is
there
was
too
much
promotion
of
religion.
the
fact
that
the
money
was
spent
on
the
conferences
is
incidental
to
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
if
i
may
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
if
this
court
recognizes
that
there
is
not
taxpayer
standing,
that
does
not
mean
that
there
won't
be
lawsuits,
that
there
won't
be
directly
injured
plaintiffs
that
can
bring
claims.
doremus
and
schemp
prove
that
point.
but
even
more
broadly,
any
time
the
establishment
clause
injury
takes
the
form
of
alleged
coercive
conduct
the
individuals
who
are
coerced
are
going
to
have
standing
to
bring
the
suit.
the
second
point
to
make
clear
is
it's
just
not
an
accurate
description
of
this
court's
cases
to
say
that
the
spending
of
appropriated
funds
by
the
executive
is
enough
to
give
rise
to
taxpayer
standing.
the
property
distribution
plan
at
issue
in
valley
forge
took
a
tremendous
amount
of
appropriated
funds
to
run.
nobody
thought
that
was
a
basis
for
taxpayer
standing.
the
bibles
that
were
purchased
and
the
salaries
of
the
teachers
in
doremus
presumably
cost
at
least
a
threepence.
but
that
was
not
found
enough.
now,
i
think
in
trying
to
understand
the
court's
cases
you
really
have
to
focus
on
this
word
"incidental".
and
i
think
that
the
colloquy
in
the
second
half
of
the
argument
shows
that
you
can't
look
at
incidental
as
being
minimal.
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
doesn't
mean
minimal.
it
doesn't
mean
incremental.
it
is
trying
to
distinguish
an
incidental
expenditure
of
funds
when...
as
to
something
where
the
expenditure
of
funds
is
central
or
vital
to
the
establishment
clause
violation.
in
the
context
of
money
going
to
third
party
religious
entities,
nobody
would
say
that
the
spending
is
incidental.
it's
the
whole
violation.
in
the
context
of
bible
reading
or
anything
else
the
executive
branch
does,
the
fact
that
money
went
to
fund
the
executive
branch
to
violate
the
establishment
clause
is
the
least
of
the
problems.
the
problem
is
the
primary
conduct
of
the
executive
branch
in
violating
the
establishment
clause,
but
that's
not
a
spending
injury.
the
funding
that
goes
into
that
is
incidental.
i
think
that's
the
way
to
make
sense
of
this
court's
cases.
it's
important
to
emphasize
what's
at
issue
here.
it's
not
a
general
challenge
to
the
faith-based
office.
it's
not
a
challenge
to
the
name
of
the
office.
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
particular
offices
and
the
assertion
that
the
executive
branch
officials
at
the
conferences
spent
too
much
time
talking
about
faith-based
groups
and
not
enough
talking
about
community-based
groups.
if
that
isn't
intrusive
on
the
executive
branch,
i
don't
know
what
is.
the
last
point
i
would
leave
you
with
is
that
if
something
has
to
go
in
this
area,
if
you
have
to
choose
between
the
logic
of
flast
and
the
irreducible
minimum
requirements
of
article
iii,
i
think
it's
an
easy
choice.
you
don't
abandon
the
basic
requirements
of
article
iii
that
distinguish
the
judiciary
from
the
political
branches
of
government.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit,
with
all
due
respect,
lost
sight
of
that.
its
decision
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
