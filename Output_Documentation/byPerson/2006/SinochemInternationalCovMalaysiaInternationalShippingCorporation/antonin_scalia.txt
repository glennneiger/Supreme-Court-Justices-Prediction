justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
been
the
allegedly
defrauded
chinese
court
which
found
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that
court
would
have
gotten
into
the
act
unless
that
was
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not,
not--
felicitously
put.
i
think
all
the
court
was
saying
was
that
there
would
no
need
for
a
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
where
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction.
the
only
point
of
the
doctrine
is
to
get
rid
of
the
case
where
you...
where
you
do
have
jurisdiction.
and
so
you
do
not
have
to...
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
must
establish
jurisdiction
before
you
can
exercise
the
doctrine.
it
is
a
doctrine
that
overrides
the
existence
of
personal
jurisdiction.
in
that
sense,
it
presupposes
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
that?
now...
to
some
extent
this
is
a
call
for
the
district
judge.
there
is
a
degree
of
discretion
involved
in
it,
and
it's
entirely
conceivable
that
one
district
judge
would
correctly
dismiss
the
case
for
forum
non
conveniens
whereas
another
district
judge
faced
with
the
same
question
would
not
do
so.
and
both
of
them
would
be
acting
lawfully;
isn't
that...
isn't
that
conceivable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
only
proved
that
an
appellate
court
can
affirm
on
grounds
other
than
the
ground
relied
upon
by
the
district
court,
even
if
the
ground
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
is
also
a
valid
ground.
it's
up
to
an
appellate
court...
it's
available
to
an
appellate
court,
especially
where
the
ground
is
jurisdiction,
to
choose
to
look
into
jurisdiction
and
say
there
isn't
any.
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
how
that
adds
to
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
found
one
appellate
court
that
chose
to
do
it
that
way.
frankly,
if
i
were
sitting
on
an
appellate
panel
i
wouldn't
do
it
that
way
if
i
thought
the
forum
non
conveniens
ground
was
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why...
i
mean,
i
assume
that
in
deciding
forum
non
conveniens...
that
there
is
an
inconvenient
forum,
the
court
making
that
judgment
would
assume
that
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
and
would
simply
say,
you
know,
put
that
into
the
mix.
assuming
we
have
personal
jurisdiction,
is
this
nonetheless
an
inconvenient
forum?
and
if
the
court
can
say
yes,
that's
the
end
of
the
game.
i
don't
see
what
you
have
to
gain
here.
suppose
the
court
does
decide
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
dismisses
for
forum
non
conveniens?
what,
what...
what
are
you
gambling
for
here?
i
don't
understand
what's
the...
what's
the
desirable
outcome
you
hope
to
achieve?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
the
district
court
at
best
for
you,
at
best,
finds
personal
jurisdiction.
if
it
finds
no
personal
jurisdiction,
you
know,
it
dismisses
for
that
reason
instead
of
for
forum
non
conveniens.
if
it
finds
personal
jurisdiction,
it
would
say:
oh,
there
is
personal
jurisdiction;
but
i
assumed
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
when
i
dismissed
it
for
forum
non
conveniens,
so
this
is
really
the
same
call
that
i
made
before.
dismissed
for
forum
non
conveniens.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
discovery
for
its
own
sake
is
no
fun.
what
does
discovery
for
its
own--
sake
achieve?
[laughter]
unless
there's
something
at
the
end
of
the
discovery.
now,
maybe
what
you
hoped
is
that
the
republic
of
china
would
not
accede
to
the
discovery
and
therefore,
you
would
get
a
default
judgment
or
something.
you
know,
i
just...
i
just
don't
see
what's
at
the
end
of
this
game
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
should
ask
the
other
side,
but
i
think
i
know
what
their
answer
will
be,
whether
if
the
court
does
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens
without
first
addressing
personal
jurisdiction,
it
must
assume
the
existence
of
personal
jurisdiction?
and
what
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
so
how
are
you
going
to
get
a
different
result
then
when
it
goes
back
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,
oh,
yes,
you
had
personal
jurisdiction,
just
as
you
thought
you
did,
whereupon
the
district
court
says,
oh,
yeah,
same
result.
