justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
on
the
second
point.
i
wanted...
does
the
rule
of
the
federal
district
court
in
forum
non
conveniens
where
it
dismisses
a
case
for
lack
of
a
convenient
form,
does
it
have
any
ongoing
consequences
as
the
law
of
the
case?
i
know
our
chick
kam
choo
precedent
where
we
said
federal
court
determination
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
binding
in
a
state
court,
but
supposing
in
this
case
that
the
parties
went
to
san
francisco
with
a...
and
said
we
want
to
sue
there.
would
the
san
francisco
court,
the
united
states
district
court
feel
bound
by
the
determination
that
this
dispute
is
determined
by
chinese
law,
and
that
the
chinese
court
is
therefore
the
appropriate
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
ruling
that
this
would
be
governed
by
chinese
law
and
that
the
chinese
court
is
the
best
forum
to
consider
that?
that
too
has
no
lat...
has
no
effect
beyond
the
court
in
philadelphia?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
martin,
in
the
hypothetical
where
this
case
is
dismissed
for
forum
non
conveniens
and
then
they
go
to
another
federal
district
court,
could
the
second
federal
district
court
say
this
has
already
been
heard
by
the
first
district
court;
i'm
not
getting
into
it?
or,
or
does
that
district
court
have,
have
to
go
through
the
motion
again?
