ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
based
on
three
reasons.
we
believe
that
personal
jurisdiction
is
a
requirement
articulated
in
gulf
oil
versus
gilbert
which
remains
before
this
judicially
created
doctrine
may
be
evaluated.
second,
we
believe
that
adopting
the
third
circuit
holding
establishes
a
clear,
bright
line
discrete
rule
that
is
easy
to
enforce
and
appropriate
to
evaluate
at
any
other
appellate
level.
and
third,
we
argue
that
the
nature
of
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
itself
presupposes
jurisdiction
before
making
a
ruling
to
dismiss
for
some
other
convenient
forum.
the
analysis
that
has
brought
the
case
to
this
court
has
included
a
divergence
of
opinions
between
various
circuit
courts.
in
the
briefing,
all
parties
tend
to
agree
that
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
non-merits-based
ground
for
evaluating
a
ruling.
the
fifth
circuit
has
decided
otherwise.
we,
we
express
some
issue
with
the
fact
that
in
looking
at
a
forum
non
conveniens
analysis,
the
court
necessarily,
as
the
government
has
conceded
in
its
brief,
takes
a
peek
at
the
merits
of
the
dispute.
the
other
issue
that
arises
is
that
if
a
court
dismisses
a
case
based
on
forum
non
conveniens,
and
then
an
appeal
is
sought,
the
appellate
court
always
has
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
both
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
personal
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
intek
versus--
engle
case,
came
up
with
such
a
ruling
recently.
they
expressed
support
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
saying
that
it
is
appropriate
to
be
able
to
deal
with
non-threshold
matters
such
as
forum
non
conveniens
without
ascertaining
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
the
court
acknowledged
that
they
thought
the
dicta
expressed
in
the
ruhrgas
opinion
would
become
the
holding
of
this
court.
however,
for
judicial
efficiency,
it
decided
to
go
through
the
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
personal
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
it
went
through
subject
matter
of
the
case
and
personal
jurisdiction,
and
it
determined
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
appropriate.
both
parties
cite
the
vast
waste
of
judicial
resources
that
would
occur
if
forum
non
conveniens
had
to
establish
personal
jurisdiction
first.
and
frankly,
we
see
that
as
the
other
way.
the
insight
case
in
our
opinion--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--well,
i
tend
to
agree
with
you
on
that
point
as
well--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--with
it.
but
i
think
what
the
third
circuit
was
stressing
in
its
opinion
is
that
you
cannot
subject
the
parties
to
litigate
in
another
forum
if
there
is
some
chance
that
your
own
forum
does
not
have
the
personal
jurisdiction.
it
is
a
prerequisite
of
the
doctrine
itself.
and
we
believe
that--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--i
think
it
is,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
the
court
would
address
that
by
saying
certainly
on
the
negligent
misrepresentation
claim
at
this
stage
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
a
ruling
in
china,
but
the
appellate
window
is
still
open.
and
certainly
the
evidence
has
long
gone
into
the
chinese
case.
those
are
completely
separate
issues.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
yes,
justice
ginsburg;
but
as
practical
matter,
with
the
resolution
of
this
case
by
this
court
we
would
certainly
have
to
start
the
process,
whatever
ruling
this
court
finds,
all
over
again.
we
certainly
cannot
participate
in
the
action
in
china
because
that
has
already
gone
on.
we
would
have
the
option
to
participate
in
the
case
in
the
united
states
because
those
specific
issues
were
not
litigated
in
china.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
it
was
appropriate
for
u.s.
review
because
of
the
balancing
of
the
maritime
commerce
that
occurred
in
the
case
because
of
the
bills
of
ladings.
although
the
district
court
believed
that
chinese
law
would
apply
to
the
contract
for
the
sale
of
the
steel
coils,
in
fact
we
would
make
the
argument
that
with
the
various
charter
parties
in
the
case,
including
the
bill
of
lading
that
you
reference,
indeed
american
law
would
apply
and
there
would
be
some
different
issues
that
would
be
evaluated.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
that
would
have
been
a
concern,
justice
ginsburg,
except
that
issue
was
brought
up
expressly
before
the
chinese
court;
and
if
i
may
refer
you
to
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
chinese
court
ruled
that,
quote,
"given
that
the
people's
republic
of
china
and
the
u.s.
are
different
sovereignties
with
different
jurisdictions,
whether
the
appellant
has
taken
actions
at
any
u.s.
court
in
respect
of
this
case
will
have
no
effect
on
the
exercise
by
a
chinese
court
of
its
competent
jurisdiction
over
said
case.
"
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
and
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
except
it
is
the
only
indication
in
the
record
that
there
is
some
foreign
nation
that
has
expressed
an
opinion
on
this.
if
you
read
the
brief
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
would
have
us
think
that
every
single
case
is
going
to
involve
foreign
nations
and
delicate
foreign
policy
disputes
and
such
other
factors.
very
clearly,
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
only
evidence
we
do
have
is
from
another
sovereign,
china,
that
says
if
you
have
a
u.s.
cause
of
action
we
have
no
problem
if
a
u.s.
court
adjudicates
it
on
the
merits.
having
said
that,
the
issue
here
was
whether
or
not
personal
jurisdiction
should
have
been
decided
before
the
forum
non
conveniens.
and
again,
we
would
just
go
back
to
our
second
point,
where
the
court
believes
that
it
can't
evaluate
a
doctrine
without
having...
if
it's
a
required
factor
of
the
doctrine
that
a
sitting
court
making
a
ruling
on
that
issue
has
to
presuppose
personal
jurisdiction.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
well,
for
malaysia
international
the
desirable
outcome
would
be
upholding
the
third
circuit
opinion.
it
then
gets
remanded
to
the
district
court.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
and
justice
scalia,
i
concede
that,
but
you
would
also
have
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
waive
personal
jurisdiction.
again,
you
get
into
the
judicial
resources.
the
defendant
could
choose
to
waive
it
at
that
point
in
time
and
then
i
am
right
back
again--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
then
i
would
have
to
look
for
an
evaluation
of
forum
non
conveniens
that
was
favorable
to
the
client.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
we
raised
on
appeal
to
the
third
circuit;
and
the
court
did
not
make
a
ruling
on
that.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
that's
one
possibility.
but
again,
we
talked
about
the
policy
issues
of
why
the
government
came
in
with
the
position
they
did.
they
suggested
that
the
united
states
had
a
very
distinct
interest
in
avoiding
delay,
burdensome
discovery,
and
difficult
legal
issues;
and
frankly,
my
thought
is
the
same
as
yours.
any
party
has
those
desires
to
avoid
those
issues
and
come
to
a
ruling
in
their
favor.
in
this
case
we
would
hope
that
with
an
adoption
of
personal
jurisdiction
first,
then
the
court
would
be
required
to
rule
on
our
motion
to
reevaluate
forum
non
conveniens
and
we
might
be
able
to
convince
the
court
to
be
able
to
pursuit
the
case
here.
in
this
particular
case,
that
is
the
goal
that
we
seek
because
that
is,
as
you
say,
all
we
have
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
game
with
it.
i
also
wanted
to--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--i
think
it
has
to,
your
honor.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
the
seventh
circuit
case--
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
--but
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
case
happening,
as
it
happened
in
the
in
re
bridgestone
case,
which
was
a
seventh
circuit
case.
in
that
case
the
court
dismissed
for
forum
non
conveniens
and
the...
i
believe
it
dealt
with
the
country
of
mexico.
the
parties
had
obtained
a
ruling
in
mexico
saying
that
the
mexican
courts
were
not
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
under
those
circumstances
the
court
was
required
to
take
back
the
case
because
it
no
longer
had
the
alternate
forum
in
which
to
adjudicate
the
dispute.
so
i
think
that's
the
one
example
of
the
case
that
you
raise.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
not
on
this
issue,
your
honor,
and
actually
not
on
the
bills
of
lading
issue.
you
did
raise
that
point
and
there
is
still
the
potential
of
arbitration
taking
place
under
the
various
charter
parties
to
adjudicate
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
remaining
parties
in
the
action.
so
that
matter
is
still
open
as
well.
ms.
ann-michele
g.
higgins
i
think,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
it's...
as
the
doctrine
developed,
the
difference
lies
in
the
statutory
framework
of
the
1404
versus
the
judicially
created
version
of
the
forum
non
conveniens.
i
think
you're
correct
that
as
forum
non
conveniens
exists
today,
side
by
side
with
1404,
you
certainly
have
the
limited
application
that
it
will
apply
to
only
foreign
nations
or
to
a
state
court.
and
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
benefit
of
creating
a
rule
that's
rather
limited
in
scope,
that
will
not
touch
many
other
factors.
it
can
be
discrete.
it
can
be
applied
easily.
and
that
comports
with
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
1.
we
thought
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
finding
by
this
court
would
be
able
to
ease
the
administration
of
cases
along
those
lines.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
certainly
would
urge
that,
based
on
precedent
and
logic
and
the
terms
of
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
itself,
that
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit
be
upheld.
thank
you.
