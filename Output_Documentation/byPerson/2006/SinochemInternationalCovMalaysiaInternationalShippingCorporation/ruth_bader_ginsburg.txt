do
you
know
any
case,
mr.
castanias,
where
there
has
been
a
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
in
favor
of
a
foreign
forum
where
the
plaintiff
has
then
attempted
to
go
into
a
different--
u.s.
court
to
get
a
different
resolution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
either
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
were
urging
that
this
is
a
threshold
issue
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits;
but
there
is
an
argument
that
the
existence
of
personal
jurisdiction
or
not
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
forum
non
conveniens
evaluation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
uh-huh.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
question
that
doesn't
even
have
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us.
i'm
curious
about
why
we're
speaking
of
fora,
judicial
fora,
there
was
in
this
picture
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
what
happened
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
and
we're
talking
about
a
suit
brought
by
one
party
in
the
united
states,
by
the
other
party
in
china,
and
no
arbitration
occurred
apparently,
although
i
thought
the
contract
called
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
gulf
oil
case
does
say
that
a
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
presupposes
that
the
forum
is
one
in
which
there's
personal
jurisdiction
and
one
of
proper
venue.
it's
just
another
forum
is
more
appropriate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hallward-driemeier,
because
your
time
is
running
out,
there
is
a
question
about
a
court
without
personal
jurisdiction
dismissing
on
forum
non
conveniens
ground,
and
that
is,
it's
common,
as
you
know,
to
condition
forum
non
conveniens
dismissals
on
the
defendant's
undertaking
that
the
defendant
will
not
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
and
other
conditions.
if
the
court
has
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant,
it
would
be
unable
to
impose
such
conditions;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
the
alternate
forum
taking
jurisdiction
here,
because
it,
in
fact,
had.
a
proceeding
was
ongoing
in
china.
so
you
brought
up
the
question
about
the
court
gives
up...
if
the
court
dismisses
on
forum
non
conveniens
and
then
the
supposedly
more
convenient
forum
doesn't
take
the
case.
but
that
can't
be
a
factor
in
this
case,
where
the
other
forum
was
in
china
and
was
indeed
litigating
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
following
you,
so
please
straighten
me
out.
i
thought
that
the
claim
was
that
a
fraud
had
been
committed
on
the
chinese
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
claim
was
that
a
fraud
had
been
committed
on
the
chinese
court
in
connection
with
the
arrest
of
this
vessel
and
the
ensuing
proceedings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
why
in
the
world
should
a
court
in
the
united
states
get
involved
in
determining
whether
a
fraud
was
committed
on
a
chinese
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
american
law
to
determine
whether
a
fraud
had
been
committed
on
the
chinese
court?
it
seems
just
stating
it
that
it
might
be
offensive
to
the
chinese
court
to
have
another
court
determine
whether
it
had
been
defrauded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
was
a
very
polite
way
of
the
chinese
court
saying:
we
don't
care
what
the
united
states
court
is
doing;
we've
got
this
case,
we've
got
the
ship,
and
we're
going
to
adjudicate
it;
and
it
doesn't
matter.
we
don't
have
to
say
anything
to
the
united
states
to
chastise
it
for
even
thinking
it
could
become
involved
in
this
matter.
it
was
polite.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
a
defendant
that
has
moved
to
dismiss
for
forum
non
conveniens
waive
jurisdiction?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
something
in
this
picture
that
is
to
your
advantage
and
that
is
if
you
can
get
the
court
to
say,
well,
we
have
to
do
personal
jurisdiction
first,
you
ask
for
discovery
on
that
issue
and
it
goes
out
on
forum
non
conveniens
without
deciding
personal
jurisdiction,
you
are
not
going
to
get
that
discovery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
know
that
that's
not
going
to
happen
here,
because
the
chinese
court
has
adjudicated
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
dealing
with,
because
it's
a
foreign
nation,
not
the
codified
forum
non
conveniens
that's
in
1404
and
1406.
and
you
are
treating
this
as
it
were
counterpart
to
1404,
which
is
forum
non
conveniens.
but
1406
is
wrong
venue
and,
as
you
know,
in
the
goldlaw
case
this
court
said
a
court
can
transfer
even
though
it
lacks
personal
jurisdiction
and
is
a
place
of
improper
venue.
now,
why
isn't
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
as
applied
to
foreign
nations
a
combination
of
1404
and
a
1406,
and
if
it
includes
1406
then
you
don't
need
your
personal
jurisdiction,
you
don't
need
venue,
you
just
transfer
it
to
a
place
where
those
conditions
exist?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
under
which
a
federal
district
court
may
dismiss
an
action
on
the
ground
that
a
court
abroad
is
the
more
appropriate
and
convenient
forum
to
adjudicate
the
controversy.
we
gladly
review
to
decide
a
question
that
has
divided
the
courts
of
appeals
must
a
district
court
first
conclusively
establish
its
own
jurisdiction
before
dismissing
a
suit
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
conveniens.
we
hold
that
a
district
has
discretion
to
respond
at
once
to
a
defendant’s
forum
non
conveniens
plea
and
need
that
take
up
first
any
other
threshold
objection.
in
particular,
a
court
need
not
resolve
whether
it
has
authority
to
adjudicate
the
cause
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
if
it
determines
that
in
any
event
of
foreign
tribunal
is
the
more
suitable
arbiter
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
underlined
controversy
concerns
a
shipment
of
steel
coils
from
pennsylvania
to
china.
malaysia
international
shipping
corporation
and
malaysian
ship
owner
charged
that
sinochem
international
company,
a
chinese
state
owned
importer
had
made
misrepresentations
to
chinese
admiralty
court
to
gain
arrest
in
china
of
malaysia
international’s
vessel,
the
vessel
that
carried
the
steel
coils
from
philadelphia
to
a
port
in
china.
sinochem
had
launched
legal
proceedings
in
china
alleging
that
malaysia
international
falsified
critical
documents
to
sinochem’s
economic
disadvantage.
in
response
malaysia
international
filed
the
instant
suit
against
sinochem
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
alleging
that
sinochem’s
petition
to
the
chinese
court
contained
negligent
misrepresentation.
sinochem
moved
to
dismiss
the
federal
court
suit
on
several
grounds,
including
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction
and
forum
non
conveniens.
the
district
court
determined
that
it
had
maritime
subject-matter
jurisdiction
but
then
it
lacked
personal
jurisdictions
over
sinochem
under
pennsylvania’s
long-armstatute.
conjecturing
that
limited
discovery
might
reveal
that
sinochem’s
national
contacts
sufficed
to
establish
personal
jurisdiction
under
a
federal
rule,
the
court
nevertheless
denied
discovery
and
dismissed
the
case
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
in
light
of
the
proceedings
on
going
in
china.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
agreed
there
was
subject-matter
jurisdiction
because
the
suit
qualified
as
an
admiralty
case
and
that
personal
jurisdiction
could
not
be
resolved
without
discovery.
then
over
a
dissent
the
majority
concluded
that
the
case
could
not
be
dismissed
under
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
unless
and
until
the
district
court
determine
definitively
that
it
had
both
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
personal
jurisdiction.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
in
steel
co.
v.
citizens
for
better
environment,
we
clarify
the
jurisdictional
questions
ordinarily
must
precede
merit
determination
in
dispositional
order.
more
recently
ruhrgas
ag
v.
marathon
oil
co.
made
a
claim
that
there
is
no
mandatory
sequencing
of
jurisdictional
issues
further
more
a
federal
court
has
leeway
“to
choose
among
threshold
grounds
for
denying
audience
to
a
case
on
the
merits.”
a
forum
non
conveniens
dismissal
is
a
non
merits
disposition
resolving
a
forum
non
conveniens
challenge
until
no
assumptions
by
the
court
of
substantive
law
declaring
power.
a
district
court
may
therefore
order
a
forum
non
convenience
dismissal
bypassing
questions
of
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction
when
considerations
of
convenience,
fairness,
and
judicial
economy
so
warrant.
the
dispute
between

and

presents
a

for

and
was
considered
at
some
length
by

courts

that
effort
could
have
been
avoided.
discovery
concerning
personal
jurisdiction
would
have
burdened
sinochem
with
expense
and
delay.
all
for
not,
the
district
court
inevitably
would
dismiss
the
case
without
reaching
the
merits,
given
its
well-considered
forum
non

appraisal.
judicial
economy
would
be
disserved
by
continuing
litigation
in
the
district
court
given
the
proceedings
long
launched
in

all
the
more
so
because

in

in

and

best
left
for

by

if
as
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
the
court
can
readily
determine
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
over
the
cause
or
the

the
proper
cause
would
be
to
dismiss
on
that
ground

where
subject-matter
jurisdiction
or
personal
jurisdiction
is
difficult
to
determine,
and

considerations
weigh
heavily
in

of
