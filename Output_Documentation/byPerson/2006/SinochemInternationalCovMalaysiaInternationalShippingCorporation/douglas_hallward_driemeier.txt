mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
steel
company
the
court
held
that
it
is
impermissible
to
adjudicate
the
merits
of
a
case
over
which
the
court
may
lack
jurisdiction.
but
it
is
another
thing
entirely
for
the
court
to
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
that
it
might
well
possess.
in
ruhrgas
clarified,
in
language
that
counsel
has
already
quoted,
that
a
court
may
choose
among
threshold
grounds
for
denying
audience
to
a
case
on
the
merits.
now,
the
dividing
line
between
a
threshold
non-merits
ground
and
a
merits
ground
may
in
some
cases
be
difficult.
and
the
court
has...
members
of
the
court
have
disagreed
in
some
cases;
but
there
is
an
easier
set
of
cases
and
that
is
where
the
court
is
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
especially
where
as
here,
it
is
doing
so
in
favor
of
litigation
of
the
substantive
dispute
in
another
forum.
and
this
court
has...
has
decided
already
that
it
is
permissible,
for
example,
for
a
court
to
decline
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
before
deciding
a
difficult
question
of
whether
it
would
possess
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
supplemental
claims
at
all.
forum
non
conveniens
is
in
the
nature
of
an
abstention
extension
doctrine.
in
gulf
oil,
one
of
the
first
cases
of
this
court
to
describe
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine
and
its
factors,
analogizes
forum
non
conveniens
to
a
burford
abstention.
the
court
even
in
steel
company
acknowledged
that
abstention
on
grounds
of
younger,
for
example,
would
be
permissible
to
decide
before
resolving
a
disputed
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the
court
said
so
in
the
course
of
rejecting
an
argument
that
because
it
was
conceded
that
jurisdiction
and
venue
were
proper
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
that
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
could
not
apply.
the
court
said
that
couldn't
be
so,
because
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
presupposes
the
availability
of
two
fora.
but
the
court
did
not
address
the
entirely
separate
question
of
whether
the
court
could
assume
that
even
i
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
would
not
exercise
it.
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that...
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
in
the
court
already
determined
it
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
if
venue
was
improper,
then
forum
non
conveniens
would
have
no
work
to
do.
but
gulf
oil
certainly
didn't
address
this
question
of
the
ordering
of
these
restful
matters.
and
of
course
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
its
entire
purpose
is
to
allow
litigation
to
occur
in
a
more
convenient
and
appropriate
forum,
and
it
would
undermine
severely
the
purposes
of
the
doctrine--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right,
we
would.
and,
and
one
of
the
cases
that
ruhrgas
quoted
and
relies
on
was
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in...
papandreou,
which
involved
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
and
there
the
court
quite
rightly
said
that
it
would
be
improper
to
force
a
foreign
sovereign
to
undergo
extensive
jurisdictional
discovery
in
this
case
when
it
was
clear
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
court
would
dismiss
day
in
favor
of
a
foreign
forum
in
any
event.
so
it
would
apply
to,
to
questions
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
well
as
personal--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
think
they
could
do
both.
the
second
would
be
really
superfluous.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
if...
if...
an
appeal,
the
court
could,
the
court
of
appeals
could
affirm
on
either
ground.
again,
to
emphasize
the
point
that
counsel
has
made,
the
argument
here
is
not
that
forum
non
conveniens
must
necessarily
be
decided
before
jurisdictional
questions.
in
fact,
the
natural
order
would
be
to
decide
jurisdictional
issues
first.
but
as
the
court
held
in
the
analogous
circumstance
of
venue
in
the
leroy
decision,
there
are
circumstances
that
counsel
in
favor
of
reversing
that
order,
such
as
avoiding
a
difficult
constitutional
issue
or,
as
in
mr.
papandreou,
avoiding
imposing
the
burden
of
jurisdictional
discovery
on
a
foreign
sovereign
or
foreign
entity
when
a
case
going
to
be
dismissed
in
the
end
in
any
event.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
think
the
second
court
would
have
to
at
the
very
least
ascertain
that
circumstances
had
not
changed
or
that
there
weren't
relevant
difference
of
facts.
your,
your
hypothetical
earlier
was
of
filing,
refiling
this
suit
in
california.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
discretionary
determination,
as
your
honor
says,
that...
that
different
judges
could
reach
different
decisions.
in
the
parsons
case,
parsons
versus
chesapeake
and
ohio
railway,
the
court
emphasized
there
the
question
was
whether
a
state
court's
forum
non
conveniens
determination
had
preclusive
effect
on
a
federal
court's
analysis
of
the
factors.
and
this
court
held
that
did
it
not.
in
large
part
because
it's
impossible
to
know
that
every
factor
would
be
the
same
or
would
be
weighed
the
same
by
the
second
court.
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
second
court
to,
to
reanalyze
the
issues;
but
even
if
it
weren't,
even
if
there
were
some
preclusive
effects,
i
don't
think
that
that
undermines
our
position,
because
it
is,
of
course,
equally
true
of
other
threshold
determinations
such
as
personal
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
they
may
have
issue-preclusive
effects
in
subsequent
litigations.
for
example,
a
trial
court
could
decide
that
it
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
the
amount
in
controversy
is
insufficient
because
under
state
law,
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
able
to
recover
punitive
damage.
that
determination
would
be
given
issue-preclusive
effect
in
a
subsequent
suit
filed
by
the
same
plaintiff
in
another
district
court.
in
fact
justice
scalia
wrote
an
opinion
on
that
subject
in
the--
d.c.
circuit
in
the
dozier
versus
ford
motor
company.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
our
understanding
of
a
conditional
dismissal
in
this
circumstance
is
that
the
dismissing
court
is
explaining
its
understanding
of
the
world,
and
that...
and
facts
as
they
bear
upon
its
analysis,
such
as
is
the
defendant
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
a
foreign
forum.
oftentimes,
the
plaintiff...
if
i
could
answer...
oftentime
the
plaintiff
objects
to
dismissal
because
they
can't
sue
the
defendant
in
the
foreign
forum.
the
defendant
agrees
to
waive
any
objection
to
jurisdiction.
that
understanding
of
fact
is
a
condition
of
the
dismissal.
if
it
later
proves
to
be
untrue
because
the
defendant
objects
to
jurisdiction
of
the
foreign
court,
it
would
be
open
to
the
plaintiff
to
seek
to
reopen
the
first
suit
on
that
ground.
thank
you
very
much.
