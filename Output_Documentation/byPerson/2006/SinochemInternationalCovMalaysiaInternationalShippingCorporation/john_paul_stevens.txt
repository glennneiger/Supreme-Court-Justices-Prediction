justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand
your
argument
to
be
that,
that
in
this
case
it
happened
to
be
the
doubt
about
personal
jurisdiction
rather
than
subject
matter
jurisdiction
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
it
were
a
doubt
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
we
talk
of
course
about
the
unnecessary
burden
on
the
litigants,
but
i
wonder
if
there
isn't
even
a
more
fundamental
problem
with
the
procedure
that
the
third
circuit
followed
here.
that
is,
is
there
really
a
case
or
controversy
down
there?
does
the
defendant
have
any
motivation
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
fighting
about
jurisdiction
when
he
knows
that
the
case
is
going
to
be
transferred
anyway?
is
this
a
real
live
controversy
on
the
issue
that's
left
open?
