mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
ruhrgas
against
marathon
encapsulated
the
relevant
line
of
this
court's
precedents
in
the
rule
that
we
suggest
controls
in
this
case.
what
it
said,
it
is
hardly
novel
for
a
federal
court
to
choose
among
threshold
grounds
denying
audience
to
a
case
on
the
merits.
now
this
court's
cases
extending
through
steel
company
and
ruhrgas
and
afterward,
hold
true
to
this
statement.
threshold
non-merits
issues
may
be
decided
by
a
federal
court
before
it
determines
its
jurisdiction,
in
that
term
meant
as
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
this
case
should
hold
the
forum
non
conveniens
is
another
one
of
those
threshold
non-merits
grounds
for
denying
audience
to
a
case
that
can
be
considered
first
before
jurisdiction.
adopting
that
rule
in
this
case
will
do
three
things.
first,
it
will
result
in
a
rule
that
is
most
faithful
to
the
court's
precedents
in
the
area.
second,
it
will
respect
the
rule
of
steel
company
and
forbid
ultra
vires
judgments
on
the
merits.
there
is
no
chance
that
a
dismissal
in
forum
non
conveniens
will
exercise
more
power
than
is
granted
to
the
federal
courts
by
article
iii
or
by
congress
in
statutes.
and
finally,
it
will
give
the
federal
courts
the
appropriate
flexibility
in
appropriate
cases
to
serve
important
interests
such
as
economy,
constitutional
avoidance,
and
particularly
relevant
in
this
case,
international
comity.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i
think
there
are
two
components
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
both
of
them.
the
first
is
whether
the
determination
that
the
federal
court
in
philadelphia,
for
example,
in
this
case,
was
an
inconvenient
forum.
would
that
determination
be
binding
on
the
court
in
san
francisco?
our
view
would
be
probably
not.
it
would
be
persuasive
in
that
case,
but
the
forum
non
conveniens--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--let
me...
that
was
the
second
part
of
your
question
that
i
was
going
to
try
to
answer.
and
with
regard
to
that,
i
think
that
it
would
not
have
preclusive
effect
in
the
main...
in
the
mine
run
of
cases.
and
the
reason
i
think
it
wouldn't
have
preclusive
effect
is
that
it
would
be
one
factor
in
what
this
court
has
described
as
a
multifarious
analysis
under
the
forum
non
conveniens
analysis
at
american
dredging,
and
so
it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
for
issue
preclusion,
for
example,
that
the
choice
of
law
determination
in
that
case
was
necessary
to
the
ruling
dismissing
the
case.
now
one
might
imagine
a
case
at
the
margins
where
that
was
the
case
and
there
might
be
a
case
for
preclusive
effect,
but
that's,
i
think,
not
likely
to
be
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
and
by
u.s.
court
you
mean
federal
court
like
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
or
perhaps
a
state
court
as
well?
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i
think
i
have
seen
cases,
and
i
can't
cite
them
to
you
as
i
stand
here
right
now,
where
litigants
have
tried
to
go
to
a
state
court.
another
federal
court,
i
can't
think
of
a
single
one.
i'm
hard
pressed
to.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
in
some
cases,
i
suppose
that
could
be
true,
justice
ginsburg;
but
the
point
of
our
rule
is
that
the
only
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
that
of
federal
court
power.
there
may
be
a
case
where
it
is
appropriate
in
the
district
court's
discretion.
in
fact
in
ruhrgas,
you
writing
for
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
normal
court
order
business
is
to
determine
subject
matter
jurisdiction
first
and
then
personal
jurisdiction.
but
the
point
of
our
application
of
that
rule
in
this
case
is
there
may
be
some
cases
where
it's
appropriate,
and
this
is
a
paradigmatic
example
of
the
sort
of
case
where
it
would
be
appropriate
to
decide
the
forum
non
conveniens
issue
first,
before
personal
jurisdiction.
i
hope
that
satisfies...
i
hope
that's
an
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
with
regard
to
the
body
of
this
court's
decisions,
we
cited
in
our
briefs
cases
like
leroy
against
great
western,
which
holds
that
a
federal
court
can
decide
venue
before
deciding
personal
jurisdiction.
in
this
case
it's
hardly
different
because
again,
as
american
dredging
pointed
out,
forum
non
conveniens
is
properly
described
as
a
supervening
venue
provision.
the
gold
law
case
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
and
the
solicitor
general
relies
on,
says
that
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
transfer
a
case
before
determining
personal
jurisdiction.
and
grants
even
more
analogous
here
are
the
extension
in
the
tenet
case.
in
the
case
of
extension,
extension
documents
have
very
similar,
though
different,
moorings
as
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine.
and
they're
both
discretionary
decisions
to
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
this
court
pointed
out,
citing
the
ellis
case,
and
it
pointed
this
out
in
the
steel
company,
ruhrgas
and
tenet
cases
that
extension
can
be
decided
first.
and
again,
applying
that
precedent
to
the
case
of
forum
non
conveniens,
it's...
it
really
does
follow
that
forum
non
conveniens
can
be
decided
first.
with
regard
to
the
tenet
case,
that
case
is
very
close
to
a
merits
issue,
perhaps
even
one
might
call
it
a
merits
issue,
but
it
was
so
threshold
that
it
was
appropriate
to
decide
the
totten
bar
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
before
jurisdiction.
again,
and
with
all
of
these
lines
of
cases,
deciding
forum
non
conveniens
first
will
have...
will
provide
no
chance
of
the
federal
court
going
beyond
its
constitutionally
and
statutorily
exercised
powers.
now,
i'd
like
to
leave
the
court
with
one
final
thought
about
the
way
this,
and
the
importance
of
applying
this
rule
in
this
case.
the
complaint
that
malaysia
international
shipping
makes
against
sinochem
is
nothing
more
than
a
claim
that
sinochem
defrauded
a
chinese
court.
there
is
a
term
used
in
the
complaint,
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
the
term
negligent
misrepresentation
is
also
used.
but
make
no
mistake
about
it.
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
sinochem
made
a
misrepresentation
to
chinese
courts.
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
interference
with
the
chinese
court
system
which
has
proceeded
to
judgment,
and
judgment
by
the
way
on
these
issues
in
favor
of
sinochem
and
against
malaysia
international,
that
really
cries
out
for
the
flexibility
inherent
in
our
rule.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of
your
question.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
my
understanding,
justice
ginsburg,
and
this
is
a
vague
recollection
from
one
aspect
of
the
record,
is
that
the
arbitration
clause
was
held
not
to
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
oh,
i'm
sorry.
to
be
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
not
held
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
not
apply.
that
issue
was
not
in
front
of
it.
but
at
the
time--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--yes,
correct.
i
think,
i
think
that,
i
think
it
was
agreed
by
the
parties
or
understood
by
the
chinese
court.
my
memory
on
this
with
regard
to
the
record,
maybe
background
facts
that
are
not
in
the
record
but
i,
on
summing
it
up,
are
a
little
be
fuzzy.
but
i
think
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
there,
in
abstention,
an...
an
arbitration
clause
i
think
provides
a
closer
question
than
this
case
does
for
an
issue
of
whether
it's
law
declaring
authority,
i
think
as
your
question
put
it.
it's
arguable
that
an
arbitration
clause
is
little
more
than
a,
in
essence,
a
forum
selection
clause
of
the
same
kind
that
a
venue
provision
or
a
forum
non
conveniens
ruling
might
provide.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i'm
sorry.
the
first
part
of
your
question
i
had
trouble--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--that...
it
may
be.
i
just,
i
don't
have
that
ruling
in
front
of
me.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
again,
we'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
we'll
rest
on
the
argument
given
in
the
briefs.
