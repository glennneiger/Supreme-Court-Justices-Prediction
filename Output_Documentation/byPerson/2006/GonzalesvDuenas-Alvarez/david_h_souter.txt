justice
david
h.
souter
will
you
help
me
out
on
one
mechanical
point?
as
you
probably
know
from
your
brief,
i
don't
come
from
a
jurisdiction
that
uses
this
rule
and
i'm
just
not
used
to
it.
i
had
thought...
and
i
guess
i'm
wrong...
that
if
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
theory
were
used
to
prove,
let's
say,
ultimately
the
offense
of
assault,
in
what
started
out
as
a
theft
case,
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
separate
charge
of
assault
but
that
the
theory
of
proof
would
be
the
natural
and
consequences
extension
of
aiding
and
abetting
so
that
there
would
at
least
be
on
the
record
a
charge
of
assault.
and
i
take
it
that's
not
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
have
this
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case
in
my
example
of...
of
theft,
and
the
further
offense
under
natural
and
probable
consequences
being
assault,
the
only
charge
against
the
defendant
who
aided
and
abetted
would
be
a
charge
of
theft;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
me
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
to
accept
your
answer,
we've
got
to
look
into
a
question
of
california
pleading
law
which
hasn't
been
passed
on
below.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're...
you're
saying
then
despite
the
fact
that
the,
the
indictment
in
this
case
said
he
willfully
et
cetera
did
this,
it
would
be
open
to
california
to
prove
that
in
fact
he
didn't
do
any
of
those
things,
but
was
merely
an
accessory
after
the
fact?
that...
that's
your
position?
that's
what
california
pleading
law
allows?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
stevens?
do
you
have
any
case
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that,
the
problem
i
guess
that
i
have
with
your
argument,
is
that
the
theory
of
taylor
and
as
carried
forward
in
shepard
was
that
there
was
a
concept
of
a
generic
offense.
and
when
aiding
and
abetting
liability
is
extended
in
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
theory,
we
face
the
fact
that
regardless
of
what
the
actual
count
is,
even
on
your
count,
there
isn't
even
a
majority
of
states
that
do
it.
and
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
that
can,
therefore,
form
an
element
of
a
generic
offense
when
it
is...
or
a
generic
concept
of
the
offense...
when
it
is
a
minority
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
didn't
we
simply
take
the
closest
federal
definition
as
being
the
touchstone?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
taylor
an
immigration
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
in
effect,
you
would
say
that
the
rule
should
be,
or
the
modified
taylor
rule
for
application
here
should
be
that
it's
either
got
to
fall
within
the
concept
of
the
federal
offense,
or
in
default
of
there
being
a
comparable
federal
offense,
a
generic
offense
defined
by
reference
to
state
practice?
