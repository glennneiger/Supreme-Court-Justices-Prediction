mr.
himmelfarb,
does
the
government
urge
that
we
consider
the
point
that
you're
now
arguing
and
the
other
points?
you
started
out
by
saying
everyone
agrees
that
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
won't
wash,
but
if
we
go
beyond
that,
then
we
are
deciding
the
question
as
a
matter
of
first
view
instead
of
review.
does
the
government
urge
that
we
dispose
of
those
issues
anyway,
even
though
they
were
not
disposed
of
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
discussed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
it
have
to
be
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit?
i
thought
this
case
was
controlled
by
a
prior
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
therefore,
there
was
nothing
more
that
was
needed
to
take
care
of
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
that?
i
was
looking
at,
what
is
it,
13-a?
how
do
we
know
that
that
charge
is
as
a
principal?
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
that
position
has
been
widely
criticized,
i
think.
is
it
the
ali
model
penal
code,
which
thinks
it's
a
bad
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
himmelfarb,
before
your
time
runs
out,
there's
something
curious
about
this
california
statute.
this
one
is
in
the
motor
vehicle
code,
and
there's
this
offense
in
the
penal
code
called
car
theft.
do
you
know
what
the
difference
between
those
two
and
what
would
move
a
prosecutor
to
charge
under
the
penal
code
as
opposed
to
the
vehicle
code?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
mentioned
in
what,
487(d)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
covers
joyriding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
temporarily.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
california
they
would?
or
is
there
a
separate
joyriding--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
meade,
the
government
says
that
definition
holds
for
penal
code
offenses,
but
it's
not
altogether
clear
that
a
definition
in
the
penal
code
would
carry
over
to
the
vehicle
code.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
how
about
how...
how
the
defendant
was
charged
in
this
very
case?
mr.
himelfarb
thought
that
it
was
plain
from
that
charge,
that's
on
13(a),
that
he
was
charged
as
a
principal.
and
you
must
take
the
view
that
this
charge,
this
information
was
inadequate
to
identify
him
as
principal.
