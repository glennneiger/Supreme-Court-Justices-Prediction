chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
05-1629
gonzales
versus
duenas-alvarez.
mr.
himelfarb.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
only
thing
that
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
the
definition
of
a
theft
offense
in
california
is
broader
than
the
generic
definition
of
theft.
all
of
these
arguments
that
are
being
discussed
are
ways
in
which
that
particular
ruling
is
supported.
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't
be
considered
subsumed
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you're
ahead
of
me,
and
i'm
still
back
on
the
last
question,
but
i
take
it
your
rationale
for
not
reaching
these
other
grounds
would
also
apply
to
your
argument
that
whatever
the
categorical
definition,
that
this
defendant
was
convicted
of
an
actual
theft
offense,
looking
at
the
charging
documents.
that
wasn't
a
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
meade.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
began
his
argument
by
saying
you
don't
defend
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
on
aiding
and
abetting.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
the
judgment,
but
you
focused
at
least
primarily
on
other
grounds
than
the
one
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
relied.
is
he
correct
that
you
concede
that
merely
because
the
statute
extends
to
aiders
and
abettors
that
is
not
sufficient
to
take
it
out
of
the
categorical
treatment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
the
third
reference
to
the
model
penal
code,
so
i
have
to
ask.
no
one's
enacted
the
model
penal
code,
have
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
describe
the
model
penal
code
as
closer
to
restatement
or
aspirational
in
terms
of
its
reflection
of
the
existence
of
general
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
what
joyriding
is?
that
when
you're
done
with
your
joy
ride,
you
return
the
car
where
you
picked
it
up?
i
thought
they
just
abandoned
it
wherever
you
happen
to
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
joy
in
that?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
understand
that
point
to
be
what
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
decided
on
the
question,
the
aiding
and
abetting
question,
they
did
decide
this
would
available
to
you
to
argue
on
remand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
you
presented
it
to
the
ninth
circuit
below.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
say
you
cannot
be
convicted
as
an
accessory
unless
you
are
charged
as
such,
and
that
the
documents
show
he
was
charged
as
a
principal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
government...
it
is
not
only
that.
the
government
has
authority
going
the
other
way.
people
versus
prado,
"in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
an
accessory
after
the
fact
must
be
indicted
and
convicted
as
such.
"
if
you
look
at
this
information,
it's
clear
that
he's
not
being
indicted
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
has
anyone
ever
been
prosecuted
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact
to
joyriding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
no
one
has
ever
been
prosecuted
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact
for
joyriding,
we'd
really
have
to
go
out
on
a
limb
to
construe
this
charging
document
which
charges
him
as
a
principal
as
actually
meaning
to
charge
him
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact,
wouldn't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
isn't
limited
to
theft
offenses,
correct?
that
would
cut
across
all
of
these
areas
in
which
the
federal
law
refers,
in
which
a
taylor
analysis
would
apply?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
mean
we
could
not
rely
on
the
categorical
approach
in
almost
any
of
those
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
the
categorical
approach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
meade.
mr.
himelfarb,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
05-1629,
gonzales
versus
duenas-alvarez.
