mr.
christopher
j.
meade
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
pick
up
on
the
point
made
by
justice
ginsburg.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
conviction
under
california's
car
theft
statute,
which
is
penal
code
487(d),
which
requires
an
intent
to
steal.
rather,
it
involves
a
conviction
under
california's
vehicle
code,
which
covers
varied
and
less
serious
conduct
including
liability
with
or
without
the
intent
to
steal
and
also
expressly
reaching
accessories
after
the
fact,
which
the
government
concedes
would
make
it
broader
than
the
generic
definition
of
theft.
the
question
is
whether
a
conviction
under
this
statute
is
a
theft
offense
and
therefore
an
aggravated
felony
triggering
the
extremely
serious
consequences
of
automatic
deportation
from
the
united
states,
a
permanent
bar
from
the
united
states,
and
in
the
sentencing
context
a
sentencing
enhancement
from
2
to
20
years
for
illegal
reentry.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
we
do
defend
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
as
an
abstract
general
matter
divorced
from
the
facts
of
this
case
and
divorced
from
california
law,
we
agree
that
aiding
and
abetting
liability
is
part
of
a
generic
definition
of
any
crime,
including
the
theft
offense
here.
however,
that's
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
stated
in
either
this
case
or
in
penuliar.
in
penuliar
the
ninth
circuit
stressed
the
extremely
broad
nature
of
california's
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
it
cited
a
case,
people
v.
beeman,
which
refers
to
the
specific
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
under
california
law.
so
the
ninth
circuit
was
talking
about
the
broad
sweep
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
california
law.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question
except
to
state
that
those
two,
those
convictions
did
happen
in
the
years
that
you
state
and
he
did
become
a
lawful
permanent
resident
in
1998.
i
believe
it
was
through
a
waiver
provision
under
the
ina
that
that's
how
he
became
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
would
disagree
with
that.
all
we
know
in
this
case
from
the
record
is
that
he
was
not
charged
with
487(d)
car
theft,
which
requires
an
intent
to
steal.
he
was
rather
charged
under
a
conviction
which
covers
joyriding.
in
my
reading
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
doesn't
contest
that
joyriding
would
put
a
statute
outside
the
generic
definition
of
theft
offense.
even
in
the
government's
presentation
today,
the
government
suggested
that
in
most
states
joyriding
would
be
outside
the
generic
definition
of--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
i
don't
think
they're
wrong.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
sure.
i'd
be
happy
to--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
it's
not
inconsistent.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
a
permanent
deprivation
is
required,
is
required.
a
less
than
permanent
is
sufficient,
as
the
ninth
circuit
stated
in
corona-sanchez.
the
ninth
circuit
has
subsequently
held
that
a
joyriding
offense
is
outside
that
definition
because
it
includes
a
brief
taking
with
an
intent
to
return,
and
the
last
footnote
of
the
government's
brief,
note
8,
cites
that
ninth
circuit
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
question
has
to
do
with
how
long
of
the
taking.
and
at
common
law--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--there
is
a
generic
rule
on
this,
and
there
is
a
consensus
among
the
vast
majority
of
states.
i
point
to
both
professor
lefave
as
well
as
the
model
penal
code.
and
what
these
rules
say...
and
this
is
true
in
the
vast
majority
of
states,
42
states
by
our
count...
is
that
if
you
take
either
permanently
or
for
an
unreasonable
amount
of
time
such
that
it
would
deprive
the
owner
of
the
significant
portion
of
the
economic
value,
then
that
constitute
a
theft
offense.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
excuse
me.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
i
mean,
that
goes
to
the
exact
point,
justice
scalia,
because
we're
not...
the
question
is
what
is
stealing.
the
question--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--or
a
reasonable
time,
or
to
place--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--the
source
is
the
generic
definition
as
applied
in
all
of
the
states.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
sure.
two
sources.
one
would
be
professor
lefave
in
his
discussion
of
what
the
intent
required
for
the
different
theft
offenses;
and
the
second
source
would
be
the
model
penal
code
when
it
sets
forth
the
requisite
mens
rea
for
theft
offenses.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no.
but
in
taylor
and
in
seidler
this
court
used
the
model
penal
code
as
a
shorthand
for
the
generic
definition
of
a
certain
crime.
but
we
don't
rely
on
the
model
penal
code.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
would
say
that
the
model
penal
code
is
consistent
with
the
majority
view.
on
this
question
of
intent
to
steal,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
42
states
hold
what
we
say
the
law
is,
that
an
intent
to
steal...
a
theft
offense
requires
a
mens
rea
more
than
taking
with
an
intent
to
give
back.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i'm
not
sure
what
it
says
about
the
death
penalty.
on
this
issue.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
if
you
abandon
the
car
wherever
you
happen
to
be
that's
not
joy
riding.
that's
covered
by
traditional
larceny
principles.
in
the,
the
case
of
state
v.
davis
from
1875
involves
that
exact
principle.
that
is
larceny
in
that
case.
but
however,
if
someone
takes
a
car,
a
teenager,
a
neighbor
takes
a
car,
drives
it
around
the
block,
brings
it
back
to
the
same
place,
that
is
joyriding.
that
is
covered
by
108.51.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
but
what
we
have
here
is
statute
that
criminalized
conduct
less
serious
than
car
theft.
this
is...
108.51
is
the
only
statute
in
california
that
covers
joyriding.
there's
a
whole
different
provision
that
deals
with
car
theft.
in
cases
where
that's
the
appropriate
charge,
prosecutors
will
charge
the
person
with
car
theft
and
meet
the
burden
of
proof.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
less
serious
crime,
a
less
serious
statute
and
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
that
require
a
very
minimal
mens
rea,
with
or
without
intent
to
steal,
is
sufficient
to
lead
to
the
very
serious
consequences
of
being
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no.
absolutely
not.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
rely
on
that.
it
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
rely
on
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
uh,
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
it
would.
i
would
like
to
also
to
address
the
question
of
accessory
liability
under
california
law.
108.51
expressly
covers
accessories.
the
government
concedes
that
if
that
term
means
accessory
after
the
fact,
then
this
statute
is
outside
the
generic
definition
of
a
theft
offense.
under
california
law,
accessory
has
only
one
meaning,
and
that
one
meaning
is
accessory
after
the
fact.
on
that
ground
alone,
this
statute
is
broader
than
a
generic
definition
of
theft
offense
and
would
provide
a...
an
alternate
ground
of
affirmance
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
have
two
responses,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
there's
a
similar
provision
to--
108.51
covering
the
taking
or
operating
of
an
airplane.
it
is
in
the
penal
code.
it
is
499(b).
it
exactly
mirrors
the
language
of
108.51.
so
presumably
the
government
would
agree
that
the
definition
of
accessory
under
california
law
in
the
penal
code
would
cover
499(b)
for
the
same
reasons
it
would
cover
under
108.51.
moreover,
accessory
under
california
law
only
has
one
meaning.
in
1872
the
california
legislature
passed
the
provision
at
issue,
section
32
and
said
accessory
is
defined
to
be
accessory
after
the
fact.
at
the
same
time,
the
legislature
passed
other
provisions
which
also
used
accessory
in
that
consistent
way.
the
california
supreme
court
as
early
as
1898
stated
that
accessory
means
accessory
after
the
fact
and
relatedly,
accessory
before
the
fact,
the
only
other
plausible
meaning
of
the
term,
has
no
meaning
under
california
law.
so
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
accessory
in
108.51
means
accessory
after
the
fact
and
that
alone
makes
a
broad
and
generic
definition
of
theft
offense.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
be
odd,
justice
alito,
because
it
is
so
clear.
it
has
to
do
with
a
statutory
term.
it
has
to
do
with
a
statutory
term
that's
defined
under
the
california
statute.
moreover,
under
a
taylor
inquiry,
federal
courts
are
often
required
to
look
at
state
law
to
figure
out
whether
a
particular
provision
is
within
or
outside
a
generic
definition
of
a
crime.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i'm
sorry.
is
what
possible?
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
disagree.
because
as
an
initial
matter,
this
case
in
our
view
is
about
the
categorical
approach.
but
as
to
your
question
about
what
these
documents
show,
no,
the
documents
in
this
case
do
show
that
he
was
an
accessory
after
the
fact
or
a
principal,
but
the
government
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
we
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
government
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
california
law
does
not
require
someone
to
be
charged
with
that
specific...
level
of
specificity.
and
that's
something
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
moreover--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--this
charge
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
he
was
charged
as
a
driver
and
taker,
as
the
principal,
or
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
this
is
a
question
of
california
law.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
a
question
of
california
law
what
needs
to
be
charged
in
a
california
charging
document.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
i
disagree.
because
under
california
law
you
need
to
charge
generally
under
the
statute,
and
the
statute
says
drive
or
take.
that's
how
he
was
charged.
moreover,
though,
under
california
law,
the
charging
document
does
not
necessarily
control
the
conviction.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
people
v
west
and
people
v
toro.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
w-e-s-t,
and
people
v
toro.
there's
also
the
case
of
sandoval
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
none
of
them
do.
they
talk
about
the
general
principle
under
california
law,
about
that
a
charging
document
does
not
necessarily
control
the
ultimate
conviction
and
sets
forth
the
test
that
needs
to
be
applied.
but
on
this
question--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
we
think
people
v
prado
supports
our
view
which
is
a
statute
specifically
that
allows
for
accessory
liability
on
its
face.
so,
therefore,
a
person
need
not
be
charged
under
the
different
accessory
statute.
however,
to
the
extent
this
court
finds
the
charging
documents
or
ultimate
conviction
ambiguous,
which
it
sounds
like
some
members
of
the
court
may
believe
it
is,
this
is
a
question
of
california
law,
as
a
first
point;
but
moreover,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
government
has
met
its
burden
under
taylor
and
shepard.
and
under
taylor
and
shepard
the
inquiry
is
whether
it
can
necessarily
be
shown
that
someone
was
convicted
of
a
generic
definition;
and
here,
given
the
ambiguity
under
california
law,
it
can't
be
said
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--of
course,
i'd
be
happy
to.
i
don't
think
it
puts
the
whole
scheme
aside.
remember,
the
government
gets
two
bites
at
the
apple
here.
they
get
a
first
bite
on
the
categoric
approach
where
all
they
need
to
show
is
that
all
the
elements
are
within
the
generic
definition
of
the
crime.
we'd
be
dealing
with
a
different
case
if
the
person
was
charged
under
the
penal
code
which
doesn't
require...
which
requires
intent
to
steal
and
which
does
not
cover
accessories
after
the
fact.
so
the
government
gets
a
free
pass
on
round
one.
on
round
two,
on
the
modified
categorical
approach
as
we're
discussing
here,
the
government
gets
a
second
chance
to...
based
on
actual
documents
in
the
record
to
establish
whether
there's
enough
there.
here
the
government
relies
on
the
charging
document
in
an
abstractive
judgment,
but
the
government
does
not
put
in
a
plea
colloquy,
it
does
not
put
in
plea
allocution,
it
does
not
put
in
any
other
documents
that
would
establish
under
shepard
that
someone
was
necessarily
convicted
of
the
crime.
so
what...
the
government
here
is
asking
to
be
relieved
of
its
burden
of
proof
which
it
has
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
note
that
on
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes.
i
would
acknowledge
the
charging
document
unto
itself,
but
not
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
the
charging
document
and
the
conviction
not
match.
i
would
note,
though,
that
the
court
need
not
go
to
the
modified
categorical
approach,
and
i
would
say
should
not.
this
is
something
that
the
board...
the
agency
has
been
able
to
deal
with
for
60
years
or
so,
dealing
with
the
actual
documents,
trying
to
figure
out
a
whether
particular
charging
document
is
or
is
not
enough.
in
shepard
itself,
which
actually
dealt
with
the
question
of
which
documents
could
or
could
not
be
considered,
the
court
did
not
go
further
and
look
at
the
next
step
and
decide
whether
those
particular
documents
did
or
did
not
meet
the
definition
in
that
case.
i'd
also
like
to
note
to
the
extent
that
this
court
finds
california
charging
law
ambiguous
or
hard
to
understand,
under
the
principle
of
jett
v
dallas
independent
school
district,
the
circuit
courts
are
in
a
better
position
to
consider
a
matter
of
california
state
law
in
the
first
instance.
so
our
accessory
argument
is
that
the
court
should
decide
the
categorical
approach
alone
on
the
accessory
after
the
fact
ground
and
remand
to
the
agency
for
consideration
under
the
modified
approach.
i'd
like
to
also
stress
that
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
on
that
ground
it
would
be
a
very
narrow
holding.
there's
only
two
other
statutes
in
california
that
expressly
include
accessories
after
the
fact.
california's
car
theft
statute
does
not
include
accessories
after
the
fact.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
court
would
only
need
to
decide
that
first
question,
not
the
second
question.
the
first
question
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
accessory
under
california
law.
that
is
sufficiently
clear
in
our
view
that
the
court
need
not
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
second
question
under
the
modified
approach
is
outside
the
core
of
what
this
case
is
about,
and
we
suggest
that
that
should
be
remanded
to
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
agency.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
do
not
know
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
but
i
also
note
that
we
don't
know
whether
anyone
has
been
prosecuted
under
108.51
on
that
ground,
we
also
do
not
know
whether
someone
has
been
prosecuted
under
section
32,
which
is
the
accessory
after
the
fact
provision,
or
more
generally
on
that
ground.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
not
necessarily,
because
what
we
have
is
a
statutory
provision
that
clearly
covers
accessories
after
the
fact.
we
do
not
have
an
example
of
someone
who
was
charged
under
108.51,
but
there
are
many
reasons
why
that
may
not
show
up,
partly
because
the
charging
documents
don't
need
to
so
provide,
in
our
view.
so
figuring
out
who
was
and
who
was
not
an
accessory
after
the
fact
or
a
principal
under
108.51
is
not
so
easy
to
distill.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
so--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--sure.
so
you're
switching
to
the
natural
and
probable
consequences?
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
and
i
thank
you
for
that
question.
someone
who,
say,
could
aid
and
abet,
or
have
the
intent
to
aid
and
abet
purchasing
alcohol
for
a
minor,
a
natural
and
probable
consequence
of
that
could
be
joyriding.
i
would
also
like
to...
turning
to
the
question
of
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine,
the
government
is
incorrect
when
it
states
that
the
majority
view
accepts
the
natural
and
probable
consequences.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
we
have
not
found
a
case
on
that.
however--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--the
natural
and
probable
consequences
theory
cuts
across
a
wide
variety
of
crimes,
as
the
government
points
out.
so
it
would
also
cover
the
different
provisions
under
the
ina
such
as
burglary,
theft,
and
other
provisions
as
well.
the
government,
though,
is
incorrect
in
stating
that
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
is
a
majority
view.
even
in
its
brief,
the
government
only
sets
forth
22
states
that
it
says
apply
that
analysis.
those
22
states
that
the
government
cites,
many
of
them
do
not
support
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
majority
view
or
even
applied
in
those
states.
for
example,
just
to
give
a
couple
of
examples,
the
government
cites
missouri
as
a
state
that
applies
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine.
however
in
missouri,
in
the
very
case
cited
by
the
government,
people
v.
evans,
the
court
rejects
the
use
of
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
and
says,
"the
use
of
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
was
error
as
a
matter
of
law.
"
the
same
is
true...
and
that's
on
the
same
page
the
government
cites.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
maryland,
where
the
same
footnote
that
the
government
cites
rejects
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
in
favor
of
a
narrower
theory.
it's
also
true
in
idaho,
louisiana,
georgia
and
texas,
also
do
not
apply
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine.
so
what,
the
government
here
is
seeking
to
hold
someone
guilty
of
a
theft
offense
as
an
aggravated
felony
without
the
requisite
mens
rea,
and
something
that's
a
minority
view
of
the
states.
just
to
put
this
into
context,
under
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine,
it's
as
if
california
passed
a
statute
saying
that
in
some
cases
someone
can
be
guilty
of
burglary
without
the
mens
rea
of
burglary,
or
saying
that
one
can
be
guilty
of
theft
without
the
mens
rea
of
theft.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
it
would.
so
it
would
not
necessarily
apply
to
the
non-taylor
provisions
such
as
the
one--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--as...
on
the
first
step,
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
it
does
mean
that,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
sure.
i'd
be
happy
to
give
a
number
of
examples.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
if
you
intend
to
aid
and
abet
robbery,
you
intend
to
aid
and
abet
robbery,
you
can
be
held
liable
for
an
unintended
rape
of
another.
if
you
aid
and
abet--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
this
is
how
it's
applied
under
california
law.
to
give
another
example--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--that's
a
real
case,
and
i'll
give
you
the
cite.
people
v.
banks,
2002
westlaw
192,--
720.
there's
another
case
cited
in
our
brief,
aid
and
abet
robbery,
natural
probable
consequence,
sex
offenses,
that's
the
people
v.
nguyen
case.
another
example,
a
person
who
has
the
intention
to
aid
and
abet
battery,
beating
someone
up,
can
be
held
guilty
for
an
unintended
robbery.
and
to
show
how
stark
this
is,
this
is
in
california,
it's
broader
than
even
the
common
law.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
what
the
taylor
analysis
looks
to
is
what's
in
the
heartland
of
a
certain
crime,
and
here
what's
in
the
heartland
of
aiding
and
abetting.
and
what
we
have
here
is
an
aberrant
doctrine
of
california
law
that
is
outside
the
mainstream.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
just
to
briefly
respond?
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
rule
that
you
state
is
that
one
intends
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
one's
own
acts.
we
do
not
dispute
this
rule.
the
question
is
as
applied
to
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
and
california
is
one
of
a
handful
of
states
that
applies
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
to
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
which
has
the
novel
and
aberrant
consequences
of
holding
people
liable
even
if
they
don't
have
the
requisite
mens
rea
for
the
offense.
