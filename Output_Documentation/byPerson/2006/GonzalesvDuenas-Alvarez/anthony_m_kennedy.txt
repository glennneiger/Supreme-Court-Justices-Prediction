justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
completely
inconsistent
with
taylor
versus
united
states
for
us
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
novel
or
an
unusual
theory
of
potential
liability
such
as
proposed
by
the
respondent,
which
would
exonerate
him
from
application
of
this
statute,
that
he
has
the
burden
to
show
that
that's
what
happened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
taylor
allow
us
to
do
that
sort
of
burden
shifting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
your
general
rule
to
accomplish
your
objective
would
be?
