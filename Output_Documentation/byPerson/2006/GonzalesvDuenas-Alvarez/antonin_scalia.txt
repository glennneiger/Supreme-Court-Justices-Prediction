justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
it.
how
can
he
be
convicted
of...
of
the
consequential
crime
if
he
is
never
charged
with
the
consequential
crime?
you
charge
him
with
the...
with
the
theft
and
convict
him
of
assault?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
well
i
thought
you...
i
thought
you
answered--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
theory
being
that
anybody
who
intended
to
aid
and
abet
a
crime
which
naturally
leads
to
another
crime
intended
the
other
crime
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
the
remaining
questions
that
were
not
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
remand
for
those
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
himelfarb,
you
point
out
these
last
two
issues
are
not,
and
probably
correctly,
that
they
are
not
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented.
well,
that
would
be
disabling
if
indeed
it
was
the
petitioner
that
is
seeking
to
raise
those
two
additional
issues.
but
here
it
is
the
respondent;
and
we
can
certainly
reach
those
issues
if
we
want
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
respondent
can
seek
to
uphold
the
judgment
below
on
whatever
grounds
he
wishes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
can
reach
those
other
issues
if
we
wish.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
the
better
course
be
also
not
to
decide
the
principal
question
you
want
us
to
decide
on
the
broad
ground
that
you
want
us
to
take,
which
is
that
if
there
are
minor
differences
between
what
you
might
call
the
general
law
of
aiding
and
abetting,
it
doesn't
matter.
why
wouldn't
it
be
wiser
to
decide
this
on
the
simple
ground
that
this
kind
of
consequential
liability
is
part
of
the
general
law
of
aiding
and
abetting,
which
you
argue
in
your
brief?
so
that
would
be
the
narrower
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
that
former
question
as
to
whether
california
theft
is
general
theft,
do
you
propose
the
same
rule?
that
even
if
california
has
some
minor
variations...
not
just
in
aiding
and
abetting
but
in
what
constitutes
theft...
minor
variations
from
what
the
general
national
rule
is,
they
should
be
disregarded?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
limit
your
rule
just
to
aiding
and
abetting
and
not
to
other
minor
variations,
just
minor
variations
in
the
aiding
and
abetting
definition?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
sentence
given
or
the
sentence
prescribed
for
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
a
factual
question?
i'm
just
curious.
if
the
government's
statement
of
the
facts
here
is
correct,
your
client,
a
peruvian,
was
convicted
of
burglary
in
1992
and
convicted
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
in
1994,
and
nonetheless
was
made
a
lawful
permanent
resident
in
1998.
how
does
that
happen?
is
that
a
mistake
or...
how
do
we
decide
who's
admitted
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
a
joyrider
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
shouldn't
steal
it
for
an
unreasonable
amount
of
time,
just
for
a
reasonable
amount
of
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
concept
of
stealing
something
for
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert,
you
assert
it's
consistent
with
the
majority
view
on
this
issue,
not
on
everything.
what
does
it
say
about
the
death
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
joy
apparently
is
you
don't
get
convicted
of
theft.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
if
you're
right
about
this
it
would
mean
the
statute
is
broader,
but
it
would
still
be
available
to
find
out
whether
your
client
was
in
fact
convicted
as
an
accessory
or
as
a
principal.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
is
that...
is
it
possible?
or
is
that
out
of
the
question
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
possible
from
pleading
documents,
from
the
charge,
to
determine
whether
he
was
convicted
as
an
accessory
or
not?
and
if
it's
clear
that
he
wasn't,
then
we're
just
wasting
our
sometime
in
arguing
this
point,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
it
says,
"who
at
the
time
and
place
last
aforesaid
did
willfully
and
unlawfully
drive
or
take
a
vehicle.
"
i
mean,
he
is...
he's
charged
with
being
the
person
who
took
the
vehicle,
not,
not
some
subsequent
accessory.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
a
question
of
cal...
it
is
a
question
of
english.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
saying
about
what
needs
to
be
charged.
we're
talking
about
what
was
charged.
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
question
what
was
charged
is
that
he
did
willfully
and
unlawfully
drive
or
take
a
vehicle.
there
is
no
way
you
can
consider
that
an
accessory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
charging
document
you
acknowledge
would
suffice
if
it
indeed
is
california
law
that
in
order
to
convict
as
an
accessory
you
have
to
charge
as
an
accessory?
you
would
acknowledge
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
partying
maybe
i
would
understand.
i
don't
know
about
joyriding.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
that's
a
real
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
the
doctrine
of
unnatural
improbable
consequences.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
tell
you,
what's
aberrant
is
the
california
interpretation
of
the
standard
doctrine
that
is
used
in
many
states,
which
is
you
intend
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
what
you
do.
and
if
california
has,
some
california
courts
have
come
up
with
weird
notions
of
that,
i
don't
know
that
that
destroys
the
uniformity
among
the
states.
