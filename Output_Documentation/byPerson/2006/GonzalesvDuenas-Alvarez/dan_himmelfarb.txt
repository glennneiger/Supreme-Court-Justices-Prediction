mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
term
theft
offense,
an
aggravated
felony
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
does
not
include
aiding
and
abetting.
that
holding
is
incorrect.
indeed,
it
is
so
clearly
incorrect
that
even
respondent
does
not
defend
it.
respondent's
aiding
and
abetting
argument
is
that
his
violation
of
the
california
vehicle
theft
statute
is
not
a
theft
offense
under
the
ina,
not
because
the
california
statute
covers
aiding
and
abetting
and
the
theft
offense
does
not,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held,
but
because
the
california
statute
covers
a
certain
kind
of
aiding
and
abetting,
so-called
natural
and
probable
consequences
rule,
and
a
theft
offense
does
not.
that
theory
is
slightly
narrower
than
the
ninth
circuit's
but
it
is
mistaken
for
many
of
the
same
reasons.
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
is
mistaken
is
that
it
would
drastically
limit
the
number
of
aliens
who
could
be
treated
as
aggravated
felons
based
on
a
conviction
obtained
in
any
jurisdiction,
because
no
jurisdiction
distinguishes
between
principals
and
aiders
and
abetters
and
it
is
ordinarily
not
possible
to
prove
that
an
alien
in
a
particular
case
was
not
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
respondent's
theory
would
have
the
same
effect
when
a
conviction
was
obtained
in
any
jurisdiction
that
obtains
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
rule.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i...
i
don't
think
it
is.
i--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
it
is
the
case
that
the
aider
and
abettor
has
to
intend
to
aid
and
abet
what
is
sometimes
called
the
target
crime.
it
also
has
to
be
the
case
that
the
principal
has
to
then
go
on
to
commit
some
other
crime,
a
subsequent
crime.
the
issue
then
arises
whether
the
aider
and
abettor
who
intended
to
assist
the
target
crime
is
held
liable
for
the
subsequent
crime.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it
could
be.
but
in
the
course
of
proving
the
aider
and
abettor
guilty
of
the
subsequent
crime
on
this
natural
and
probable
consequences
theory,
there
would
have
to
be
proof
that
bore
upon
the
target
crime
to
show
what
his
intent
was
with
respect
to
the
target
crime
and
also
whether
the
subsequent
crime
was
a
foreseeable
consequence
of
the
initial
crime.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
justice
scalia.
he
would
have
to
be
charged
with
the
subsequent
crime.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
meant
to
say
he
didn't
have
to
be
charged
with
the
initial
crime.
in
fact,
even
the
principal
wouldn't
have
to
be
charged
with
the
initial
crime
or
for
that
matter,
any
crime.
the
aider
and
abettor
could
be
charged
only
with
a
consequent
crime
but
in
the
course
of
proving
that
under
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
rule,
there
would
have
to
be
proof
with
respect
to
the
target
crime,
because
the
elements
of
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
rule
depend
upon
what
happened.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
the
basic
principle.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
think
that
the
aiding
and
betting
argument
that
respondent
raises
is
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented
and
that
it
should
be
resolved.
we
don't
think
the
other
two
issues
are
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented.
we
think
that
this
issue
is
fairly
presented
within
the...
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented
and
should
resolve--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--it
wasn't,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it
bears
upon
the
question
of
what
it
means
to
say
that
an
aggravated
felony
encompasses
aiding
and
abetting.
if
the
court
simply
holds
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
that
aiding
and
abetting
is
included
in
an
aggravated
felony,
it
will
leave
open
a
very
important
question
which
we
think
the
court
should
provide
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
on.
it
would
leave
open
the
question
of
whether
that
means
that
there
is
some
general
federal
immigration
law
definition
of
aiding
and
abetting
with
which
the
law
of
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction
would
have
to
be
compared
in
every
single
removal
case,
at
least
potentially,
or
rather
as
we
would
submit,
that
congress
intended
to
cover
the
entire
range
of
aiding
and
abetting
under
whatever
formulation
was
used
in
any
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
aiding
and
abetting
provision
was
added
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
certainly
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--yes.
it's
open
to...
it
would
be
open
to
the
ninth
circuit.
assuming
the
ninth
circuit
were
of
the
view
that
they
were
fairly
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
also
that
they
were
fairly
raised
in
the
agency,
it
would
be
open
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
resolve
those
questions
in
the
first
instance.
let
me
just
add
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
pass
upon
any
issue
except
the
question
whether
aiding
and
abetting
as
a
general
matter
is
included
in
a
theft
offense.
relying
on
a
prior
decision,
it
held
that
it
wasn't,
and
sent
the
case
back
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
but
there,
i
think
it
would
still
be
fair
for
the
government
to
argue
that
a
particular
theory
that
may
be
raised
here
in
defense
of
the
judgment
wasn't
properly
raised
either
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
respondent,
or
before
the
agency,
such
that
that
claim
was
not
properly
exhausted.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
of
course.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
of
course.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it's
ultimately
a
matter
of
the
court's
discretion.
our
submission
is
that
the
wiser
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion
would
not...
would
be
not
to
address
the
issue,
particularly
the
last
issue
raised
in
respondent's
brief.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
read
the
ninth
circuit's
order
that
way.
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
simply
reversed
on
the
strength
of
its
prior
decision
in
penuliar.
and
in
penuliar,
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
held
the
reason
this
california
statute
was
not
a
theft
offense
was
that
conviction
under
it
is
possible
under
an
aiding
and
betting
liability
theory.
so
insofar
as
the
order
relied
on
penuliar,
it
was
saying
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
that
respondent's
conviction
was
not
a
theft
offense
because
it
is
theoretically
possible
he
was
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor
and
the
definition
of
theft
offense
under
the
ina
does
not
include
aiding
and
abetting.
now
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
make
clear
what
it
means
to
say,
that
aiding
and
abetting
is
included
in
the
aggravated
felony
definition.
and
this...
the
type
of
argument
that
respondent
raises
here,
i
think
is
important
to
keep
in
mind,
is
not
limited
to
the
particular
aspect
of
aiding
and
abetting
law
on
which
he
relies.
there
are
a
great
many
different
formulations
of
the
basic
requirements
of
aiding
and
betting.
not
only
that
they...
they
vary
not
only
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
but
even
within
jurisdictions.
so
in
the
next
case,
you
could
imagine
an
alien
or
removal
case
arguing
that
because
some
other
requirement
of
aiding
and
abetting
law
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
he
was
convicted
is
broader
than
the
more
typical
formulation,
that
even
though
he
was
clearly
convicted
of,
for
example,
murder,
and
even
though
the
elements
of
murder
in
that
jurisdiction
perfectly
match
up
with
the
federal
definition
of
murder
in
the
immigration
statute--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
main
submission
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
an
issue
of
aiding
and
abetting.
we
petitioned
on
that
question
and
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
that
question.
the
three
grounds
on
which
respondent
relies
on
defense
of
the
judgment,
even
though
they
all
vary
in
some
sense
from
the
ninth
circuit's
ground,
two
of
them
simply
have
nothing
to
do
with
aiding
and
abetting.
the
first
ground
is
an
aiding
and
abetting
argument.
it's
slightly
different
from
the
one,
slightly
narrower
than
the
one
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
relied,
but
we
think
it's
fairly
included
and
we
think
the
court
should
address
it.
we
think
the
court
should
reject
it
for
the
reasons
i
am
attempting
to
articulate
now.
if
you
have
a
jurisdiction
with
a
law
of
aiding
and
abetting
that
is
broader,
it
can
be
characterized
as
broader
in
some
sense
than
what
might
be
thought
to
be
the
general
notion
of
aiding
and
abetting,
under
the
premise
of
respondent's
theory,
you
could
conceivably
have
this
kind
of
argument
in
any
removal
case--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
alito,
we
think
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
court
to
leave
open
the
question
that
if
at
some
point
in
the
future,
some
entirely
novel
radical
far-reaching
theory
of
aiding
and
abetting
were
adopted,
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
i
don't
think
as
the
law
currently
stands
there
is
any
such
theory
in
any
jurisdiction;
and
i
think
that
congress
should
be
presumed
when
it
enacted
the
aggravated
felony
provision,
to
be
covering
the
field
of
possibilities.
but
if
at
some
point
in
the
future
some
jurisdiction
decided
that,
you
know,
somebody
could
be
strictly
liable--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
we
think
that
that's
not
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented.
we
think
that's
just
a...
accessory
after
the
fact
is
a
separate
crime--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
we
think
that
the
court
could
resolve
that
issue
along
the
lines
we've
suggested
in
our
reply
brief.
respondent's
basic
submission
on
that
point
is
that
the
term...
the
phrase
in
the
california
statute,
any
person
who
is
a
party
or
an
accessory
to
or
an
accomplice
in
the
driving
or
unauthorized
taking
or
stealing,
that
in
that
phrase
the
term
accessory
means
accessory
after
the
fact.
an
accessory
after
the
fact
is
not
included
in
the
definition
of
the
theft
offense.
therefore,
the
california
statute
is
broader
than
a
theft
offense.
it's
our
submission
that
the
court
can
assume
that
he's
right
about
that
but
still
rule
for
the
government
on
the
accessory
after
the
fact
issue,
because
whatever
the
statute
might
say,
he
was
charged
as
a
principal.
and
the
law
is
clear
that
somebody
charged
as
a
principal--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute
up
to
the
point
where
the
statute
uses
the
phrase
i
just
read.
so
it's
principal
language.
it's
theoretically
possible
that
he
was
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor
because
the
law
in
california,
as
it
is
elsewhere,
is
that
somebody
charged
as
a
principal
can
be
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor;
but
the
law
in
california,
as
it
is
elsewhere,
is
that
somebody
charged
as
a
principal
cannot
be
convicted
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
there
is
no
language
in
the
charging
instrument
to
suggest
that
respondent
was
charged
as
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
that's
right.
respondent
raises
a
number
of
arguments
in
response
essentially
to
the
argument
i
just
made.
we
think
they're
all
entirely
insubstantial
and
could
be
rejected
quite
easily.
but
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
would
think
that
the
better
course
is
not
to
address
the
accessory
after
the
fact
issue.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that
would
be
narrower
ground.
that
is
certainly
our
fallback
position
and
we
would
not
be
at
all
unhappy
if
the
case
were
resolved
on
that
ground.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
has
been
some
criticism
of
the
rule,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it
is
applied
in
criminal
cases
in
federal
courts;
and
whatever
criticism
there
might
be
in
the
academic
literature,
even
in
some
state
decisions,
we
think
it
is
just
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
somebody
could
be
convicted
under
this
theory
under
the
federal
criminal
law
and
be
subject
to
the
same
criminal
penalties
as
a
principal,
and
yet
under
the
federal
immigration
law
could
not
be
subject
to
the
same
immigration
consequences
as
a
principal.
so
whatever
grounds
there
are
for
criticizing
it,
it
is
the
law
in
most
places.
and
most
importantly,
we
think,
it
is
the
law
in
federal
courts.
taking
account
of
minor
variations
in
formulation
of
aiding
and
abetting
standards
among
jurisdictions
would
not
only
have
the
consequence
of
drastically
limiting
the
number
of
aliens
who
could
be
found
to
be
aggravated
felons,
because
of
the
difficulty
of
establishing
that
someone
was
convicted
as
a
principal
rather
than
an
aider
and
abettor.
it
would
also
complicate
removal
cases
enormously,
as
i
mentioned.
the
premise
of
respondent's
aiding
and
abetting
theory
would
suggest
that
in
any
case,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
immigration
judge,
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
reviewing
court,
to
engage
not
only
in
an
analysis
of
whether
the
principal
offense
of
conviction
matches
some
federal
definition,
which
itself
can
be
a
quite
complex
enterprise,
but
having
done
that,
it
would
then
have
to
go
on
and
compare
the
aiding
and
abetting
law
of
the
state
of
conviction
with
some
federal
aiding
and
abetting
law.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
think
that...
we
don't,
first
of
all.
and
i
think
no
court
would
say
that
and
we
certainly
wouldn't.
but
there's
a
very
important
difference
insofar
as
that
type
of
comparison
was
concerned
between
on
the
one
hand
a
principal
offense
and
on
the
other
hand
aiding
and
abetting.
the
two
important
differences
are
if
you
have
a
general
definition
of
the
principal
offense,
whether
it's
a
theft
offense
or
burglary,
any
reasonable
framework
would
contemplate
that
in
a
great
many
cases
you
would
be
able
to
tell
whether
the
alien
before
the
court
was
convicted
of
that
offense,
of
the
federal
definition
of
that
offense,
simply
by
looking
at
the
state
statute
of
conviction;
and
if
it
matches
it,
that's
the
end
of
the
analysis.
if
it's
broader,
in
most
cases
you'd
be
able
to
look
at
the
charging
instrument
and
see
whether
that
person
was
charged
with
something
narrower
than
the
whole
range
of
conduct
that's
covered
by
the
statute.
under
respondent's
theory,
if
you
were
to
apply
that
same
approach
to
aiding
and
abetting
you
would
never
be
able
to
look
at
the
statute
to
see
whether
somebody
was
convicted
under
an
aiding
and
abetting
theory
that
matches
the
federal
definition
because
every
statute
includes
aiding
and
abetting,
so
it's
impossible
to
tell
from
the
statute
whether
somebody
was
convicted
as
a
principal
or
an
aider
and
abettor.
then
if
you
look
at
the
charging
instrument,
that
won't
suffice
either
because
the
law
everywhere
as
far
as
i'm
aware
is
that
somebody
charged
as
a
principal
can
be
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
so
the
only
cases
in
which
you'd
be
able
to
establish
that
somebody
was
not
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor
are
the
unusual
cases
where
there
happens
to
be
something
in
the
files
of
the
criminal
case
that
will
explain
in
some
admissible
fashion
whether
the
defendant
was
convicted
as
a
principal
or
an
aider
and
abettor.
that's
the
first
important
distinction.
the
second--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
i
mean,
our
submission
is
that
congress's
intent
in
enacting
an
aggravated
felony
provision
that
captures
aiders
and
abettors
was
that
minor
variations
in
formulation
wouldn't
matter
for
the
reasons
i'm
giving.
so
it's
ultimately
a
matter
of
congressional
intent.
the
second
reason
why
this
is
important
is
because
if
you
were
to
apply
that
rule
to
aiding
and
abetting
you
would
be
saying,
in
effect,
that
in
any
jurisdiction
that
applies
a
broader
rule
of
aiding
and
abetting
every
single
crime
in
the
criminal
code
would
not
qualify
for
aggravated
felony
status,
because
an
aiding
and
betting
statute
runs
with
the
entirety
of
the
criminal
code
and
is
a
potential
theory
of
liability
for
every
substantive
criminal
offense.
so
that
would
mean
that
in
those,
those
broader
aiding
and
abetting
jurisdictions,
nothing
could
ever
be
an
aggravated
felony
unless
the
government
could
somehow
search
through
the
criminal
files
and
find
something
to
prove
that
in
fact
the
defendant
was
not
convicted
under
an
aiding
and
abetting
theory.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
the
theft
offense
that
covers
cars
under
than
this
one
in
california
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
ginsburg,
is
just
a
grand
theft
statute,
which
is
just
general
theft
as
applied
to
particular
circumstances,
one
of
which
is
the
theft
of
a--
car.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
that's--
right.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
essentially
a
larceny
statute,
which
encompasses
a
common
law
larceny
rule,
which
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
intent
to
steal
or,
stated
differently,
that
there
has
to
be
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
car,
of
the
car
permanently,
whereas
the
california
vehicle
theft
statute
at
issue
here
is
a
broader
statute
in
that
it
doesn't
require
any
intent
to
steal.
it
doesn't
even
require
a
taking.
a
driving
is
sufficient.
so
it
would
capture
the
receipt
of
stolen
property.
and
it
doesn't
require
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
car
permanently.
it
would
be
sufficient
if
there
was
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
car
temporarily.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
it
would
cover...
it
would
cover
what
is
colloquially
known
as
joyriding
if
it
fell
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
that
is,
if
there
was
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
property.
and
on
the
subject
of
joyriding,
let
me--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--at
least
temporarily.
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
on
our
reading
of
the
statute,
on
our
understanding,
that
a
theft
offense
would
cover
the
california
vehicle
theft
statute
here.
that
would
mean
that
joyriding
would
be
included.
but
i
think
it's
critical
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
two
very
important
limitations
in
the
federal
definition
of
theft
offense.
the
first
is
that,
as
interpreted
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
it
does
require
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
property,
and
a
great
many
unauthorized
use
of
vehicle
statutes
in
the
state
don't
have
that
element.
that's
one
important
limitation.
the
other
is
that
many
of
these
statutes
are
misdemeanor
statutes,
so
somebody
convicted
of
it
would
not
be
sentenced
to
more
than
a
year
in
prison.
by
the
terms
of
the
theft
offense
provision
of
the
aggravated
felony
provision
in
the
ina
you
have
to
be
sentenced
to
at
least
a
year
in
prison
in
order
to
be
treated
as
an
aggravated
felon.
so
we
think
the
vast
majority
of
what
is
colloquially
known
as
joyriding
cases
would
not
fall
within
this
particular
aggravated
felony.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
joyriding
in
california
would
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
but
unless
there
was
an
intent
to
deprive,
there
could
be
no
conviction,
and
unless
the
sentence
was
at
least
a
year
it
would
not
be
treated
as
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
the
sentence
given,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i'd
like
to
reserve
the--
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well
ultimately,
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
think
that
taylor
controls
on
the
question
of
what
congress's
intent
was
under
the
ina.
ultimately
taylor
was
a
question
about
congress's
intent
in
enacting
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
and
every
aspect
of
that
decision
was
tied
in
some
way
to
congress's
intent
there.
we
think
congress's
intent
in
enacting
the
aggravated
felony
provision
of
the
ina
has
to
be
that
it
didn't
intend
that
you
would
have
these
highly
arcane
comparisons
of
some
general
definition
of
aiding
and
abetting,
which
either
would
or
wouldn't
include
the
infinite
variety
of
formulations
of
aiding
and
abetting.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it's
the
one
i
suggested
when
i
was
up
here
earlier,
which
is
a
holding
by
this
court
that
congress
intended
to
include
aiding
and
abetting
liability
in
the
aggravated
felony
provision,
and
intended
to
cover
whatever
formulations
were
extant
in
1988
when
the
provision
was
enacted.
the
court
can
leave
open
the
possibility
that
if
in
some
future
case,
some
jurisdiction
were
to
enact
an
extraordinarily
far
reaching
theretofore
unheard
of
formulation,
for
example,
anybody
who
intentionally
insists...
assists...
without
regard
to
whether
the
person
even
knew
about
the
principles
of
criminal
conduct,
could
be
held
liable
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
in
that
circumstance,
it
might
well
be
the
case
that
a
state,
by
adopting
such
a
far
reaching
theory
of
aiding
and
abetting,
would
in
effect
forfeit
the
right
to
have
any
of
the
subsequent
provisions
in
its
criminal
code
treated
as
aggravated
felonies
unless
the
government
in
the
immigration
case
could
somehow
prove
that
the
alien
wasn't
convicted
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
even
under
our
fallback
position,
justice
souter,
under
which
you
would
have
to
come
up
with
some
general
definition
of
aiding
and
abetting
and
then
make
a
comparison
with
the
law
of
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction.
and
even
if
it's,
you
know,
20-20
or
18-18
among
the
states
on
this
particular
wrinkle
in
the
law
of
aiding
and
abetting,
we
think
it
is
frankly
dispositive
in
this
case,
that
it
is
the
federal
rule,
and
my
friend
mr.
meade
has
not
disputed
that.
we
think
it's
just
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
in
a
federal
criminal
case
if
you're
charged
with
murder,
you
can
be
convicted
under
a
natural
and
probable
consequences
theory
such
that
you
could
conceivably
spend
life
in
prison
the
same
way
a
principal
would,
and
yet
you
would
not
be
subject
to
the
same
immigration
consequences
as
somebody
convicted
of
the
principal
offense
of
murder,
and
indeed,
that
you
wouldn't
even
be
able...
the
government
wouldn't
be
able
to--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i...
in
taylor?
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
taylor
was
that
there
really
is
no
federal
definition
of
burglary.
that's
part
of
it.
the
other
part
of
it
is
to
some
extent,
the
court
did
rely
on
the
federal
definition
in
taylor.
the
original
version,
the
original
version
of
the
office
statute
defined
burglary,
and
it
defined
it
in
a
generic
way
which
was
broader
than
the
common
law
rule.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
it
wasn't.
it
was
a
criminal
case.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
our
primary
submission
is
that
in
the
context
of
aiding
and
abetting,
there
shouldn't
be
any
generic
definition
beyond
what
the
states
apply,
whatever
the
formulation.
our
fallback
position
is
essentially
what
you
just
described,
and
we
think
we
should
prevail
under
it
because
we
think
we
have
the
federal
rule.
we
think
we
have
the
majority
rule
in
the
states.
and
we
have
the
common
law
rule
as
well.
