justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
your
opinion
when
it
defined
generic
theft
as
the
taking
or
exercising
control
over
property
without
consent,
with
the
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
rights
and
benefits,
even
if
it
is
less
than
permanent
or
total?
they're
wrong
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
i
don't
see
how
you
make--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
that
inconsistent
with
what
you
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
how
that
could
be
right,
though.
i
mean,
when
you
joyride
it's
less
than
personal.
in
other
words,
their
definition
is
if
you
take
somebody
else's
property
for
an
hour
that
that
isn't
theft,
but
if
you
take
it
for
a
day
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
trying
to...
is
there
a
common
law,
because
they're
trying
to
report...
is
under
the
common
law
there
a
rule
or
any
generic
rule
that
says
if
you
take
somebody
else's
property
for
a
couple
of
hours
it
is
not
theft,
but
if
you
take
it
for
several
hours
or
several
days
it
is
theft?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
the
rule
is
something
is
theft
only
if
you
take
it
long
enough
to
deprive
an
owner
of
a
significant
portion
of
its
value?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
wait.
i
want
to
know
where
that
comes
from,
because
i
would
think
i
have
a
volvo.
it
lasts
for
about
30
years,
apparently.
so
i
guess
if
you
took
my
car
for
a
year,
that
that
then
would
not
be
a
theft,
or
maybe
it
would
be.
where
is
the
source
of
the
rule
you
just
cited?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
want
a
book.
i
want
a
book
that
will
tell
me
that
if
they
take
my
car
for
a
month
it
isn't
theft,
but
if
they
take
it
for
a
year
it
is.
what
book,
or
where
do
i
look
to
verify
that
this
is
common
law?
i'm
not
denying
what
you're
saying.
i
just
want
to
know
where
to
look.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
do
we
do
about
that?
no,
you
have
no
interest
in
answering
my
question,
but
the
question,
it
seems
to
me
under
the
law,
here
is
what
i
do...
and
i'm
a
good
deference
lawyer,
as
you
are.
i
simply
look
at
the
statute.
and
i
imagine
some
very
weird
case
that
the
statute
could
cover
where
the
person
wouldn't
have
the
right
intent
or
it
wouldn't
be
theft
or
it
would
be
some
odd
thing.
there's
no
possibility
in
the
world
that
applied
to
my
client.
but
most
charges
are
simply
stated
in
the
wording
of
the
statute.
and
most
judgments
simply
say
guilty.
so
i
say
"see,
you
see,
it
is
theoretically
possible.
"
and
now
when
you
decide
what
really
happened,
court,
you're
supposed
to
look
only
to
the
charging
documents
in
the
judgment;
and
you
can't
say
it
didn't.
so
the
whole
congressional
scheme
is
basically
put
to
the
side.
now
what's
the
answer
to
that
problem,
insofar
as
you
want
to
answer
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
been
able
to
think
of
any
examples
where
a
person
could
have
been,
convicted
of
this
statute,
under
the
statute
would
he
actually
have
been
some
kind
of
accessory
to
another
person
committing
another
crime,
and
the
natural
and
probable
consequence
was
that
that
other
person
would
violate
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
been
able
to
think
of
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
am.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
what's
an
example
of
where
you're
held
guilty
on
the
ground
that
you
aided
and
abetted
natural
and
probable...
somebody
did
x
and
the
natural
and
probable
consequence
was--
y.
because
after
all,
you
are
properly
held
guilty
when
you
do
an
act
and
a
known
consequence
is
y.
so
what's
an
example
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
would
be
good
enough.
the
best
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
known
and
probable
consequence?
that's
a
probable
consequence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
maybe
the
problem
is
that
they
don't
define
natural
and
probable
consequence
properly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
asking
us
to
say--
that
not
only
do
the
states
have
to
have
the
same
rule,
but
they
have
to
interpret
the
rule
the
same
way.
this
would
make
the
application
of
the
categorical
approach
impossible.
you'd
have
to
look
not
only
to
the
expression
of
the
rule
of
law
by
the
state
courts,
but
to
its
application
by
the
state
courts
in
every
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
that
just
makes
the
whole
enterprise
infeasible,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
immigration
law
provides
for
the
removal
from
the
united
states
of
an
alien
who
has
been
convicted
of
“a
theft
offense”
for
which
the
term
of
imprisonment
is
at
least
one
year.
now
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
term
“theft
offense”
which
of
here
is
not
immigration
statute
includes
aiding
and
abetting
of
theft
offense.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
didn’t
but
we
hold
it
does.
what
the
immigration
act
does
is
it
list
offences
and
conviction
for
any
one
of
those
offences
can
subject
an
alien
to
removal
from
the
united
states.
now,
our
problem
of
course
is
that
the
states
have
a
lot
of
different
definitions
of
crimes
like
burglary
or
theft.
so
how
do
you
know
if
a
particular
state
definition
falls
within
the
crime
theft
offence
or
burglary,
or
some
other
listed
crime.
this
court
has
applied
an
approach
which
was
set
forth
taylor
v.
united
states
and
shepherd
v.
united
states
and
that
approach
says
in
this
to
solve
of
this
problem
what
you
do
is
you
look
for
the
generic
definition
of
an
offense
like
burglary,
which
is
the
most
common
state
definition,
and
if
the
state
statute
would
list
the
crime
that
falls
within
that
common
definition
then
it
fits
and
it's
a
theft
offense
or
a
burglary
or
whatever.
so
we
apply
that
framework
to
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
violating
a
particular
section
of
the
california
vehicle
code
that
doesn’t
say
theft
but
it
criminalizes
the
taking
of
a
vehicle
without
the
owners
consent
or
the
aiding
in
abetting
of
a
taking
of
a
vehicle
without
the
owners
consent.
so
the
question
is
what
about
an
aider
and
abettor.
does
he
like
a
principal
fall
within
the
scope
of
generic
definition
of
theft
as
most
states
apply
that
term.
well
we
end
up
thinking
that
it
does,
it
does
fall
within
it
because
we
looked
up.
however,
jurisdiction
considers
the
matter
and
every
jurisdiction
as
far
as
we
can
tell
has
“expressly
abrogated
the
distinction”
between
principals
on
the
one
hand
and
aiders
and
abettors
who
would
help
a
principal
before
or
during
the
crime.
now
since
every
state
has
oblige
that
distinction
then
the
term
theft
is
now
used
in
the
criminal
codes
of
most
states
does
cover
aiders
and
abettors
as
well
as
principals
and
therefore
the
aiders
and
abettors
have
to
fall
within
the
term
“theft”
as
it's
used
generically
in
the
federal
statute
and
that’s
why
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
in
addition,
the
duenas-alvarez
argues,
well,
california’s
law
is
special
and
not
the
same
as
other
states
in
a
particular
respect,
namely
they
have
the
special
doctrine
called
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
doctrine
which
could
hold
the
person
liable
for
natural
and
probable
consequences
even
though
he
never
intended
to
do
the
thing.
or
we
looked
that
up
and
the
cases
that
we
read
convinced
us
that
california
doesn’t
have
a
special
doctrine
in
that
respect
that
it's
closing
up
to
the
doctrine
of
the
other
states
to
be
treated
similarly.
then
duenas-alvarez
makes
two
more
arguments
and
he
says
“well
this
statute
penalizes
joyriding
and
it
also
penalizes
an
aider
and
abettor
who
is
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
now
there
we
say
that
was
not
in
the
question
presented
that
ninth
circuit
didn’t
decided,
and
so
the
ninth
circuit
didn’t
look
at
that
on
remand.
the
result
is
we
have
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
question
they
have
decided
and
we
are
sending
it
back
for
further
work
on
these
other
questions.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
