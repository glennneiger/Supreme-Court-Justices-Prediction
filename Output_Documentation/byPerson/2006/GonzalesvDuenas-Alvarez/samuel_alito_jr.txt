justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
particular
jurisdiction
has
an
entirely
novel
and
fundamentally
different
theory
of
aiding
and
abetting?
is
it
simply
sufficient
that
it
is
labeled
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
wouldn't
it
odd
for
this
court
to
decide
that
issue
of
california
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
order
to
agree
with
you
on
the
accessory
point,
though,
don't
we
have
to
decide
two
disputed
issues
of
california
law?
whether
accessory
here
in
this
statute
means
accessory
after
the
fact,
and
whether
if
somebody
is
charged
under
that
statute
as
an
accessory,
that
has
to
be
alleged
specifically
in
the
indictment,
or
whether
it
is
just
sufficient
to
charge
the
person
with
the
offense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
there
cases
that
hold
that
the
natural
and
probably
consequences
of
purchasing
alcohol
for
a
minor
could
be
joyriding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
or
anything
else
that
somebody
might
do
after
getting
intoxicated?
