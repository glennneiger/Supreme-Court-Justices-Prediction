mr.
himmelfarb,
what
about
accessory
after
the
fact,
do
your
comments
apply
to
that
argument
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
may
not
be
fairly
included
but
as
you've
acknowledged,
it
is
an
argument
asserted
to
defend
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
west
and
toro.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
any
of
those
cases
squarely
hold
that
he
could
be
convicted
of
being
an
accessory
after
the
fact
on
a
general
indictment
like
this?
