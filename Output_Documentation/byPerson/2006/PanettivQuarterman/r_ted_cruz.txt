mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
centuries
courts
have
struggled
with
how
to
reconcile
mental
illness
with
criminal
justice.
in
this
case,
however,
the
court
should
not
reach
the
merits
of
that
issue
because
the
aedpa
presents
two
independent
jurisdictional
bars
to
reaching
the
merits.
first,
section
2254
bars
relief
because
the
state
court
proceedings
complied
with
clearly
established
law
under
ford;
and
second,
the
plain
text
of
section
2244
bars
relief
because
panetti's
claim
was
a
second
or
successive
habeas
application.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
he
could
have
raised
it
in
precisely
the
same
way
the
petitioner
did
in
martinez-villareal.
he
could
have
raised
it
in
the
first
federal
habeas
application.
it
would
have
been
dismissed
as
unripe.
and
given...
following
the
court's
majority
opinion
in
martinez-villareal,
that
claim
could
then
be
reopened
at
what
time
it
did
become
ripe.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
souter,
i
don't
disagree
with
you
that
as
a
policy
matter
it's
not
the
most
satisfactory
outcome.
the
difficulty...
and
it's
the
difficulty
this
court
wrestled
with
in
martinez-villareal...
is
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
suggests
a
clear
outcome,
an
outcome
that
is
not
necessarily
the
most
practical
or
efficient.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
our
judgment
that
reading
is
not
consistent
with
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
the
only
two
bases
that
petitioner
could
legitimately
advance
for
disregarding
the
plain
text
are
that
doing
so
would
be
absurd
following
the
plain
text
or
unconstitutional.
he
has
attempted
to
advance
neither.
he's
simply
arguing
it
would
be
more
efficient.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
congress
may
not
have
been...
i
don't
doubt
that
there
is
a
real
possibility
congress
in
drafting
this
statute
was
not
specifically
considering
ford
claims.
but
what
congress
was
doing
was
writing
into
law
a
general
principle
that
every
claim
a
habeas
petitioner
has
that
petition
must
include
in
his
first
petition.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
but
given
the
exceptions,
also
every
claim
he
intends
to
raise
at
any
point
in
the
proceeding.
in
this
case,
panetti
was
on
full
notice.
he
had
been
arguing
about
competency
from
day
one
and
he
had
not
only
martinez-villareal
which
gave
him
a
direct
path
to
preserve
this,
but
he
had
fifth
circuit
precedent
that
required
him
to
raise
this
and
he
disregarded
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--congress
intended
that
this
statute
be
followed
in
order
to
have
federal
district
court
jurisdiction
over
claims.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
is
the
way
the
court
found
in
martinez-villareal,
to
harmonize
ford
claims
with
2244.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
you.
that
is
the
heart
of--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that
hypothetical
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
precisely
the
one
you
raised.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
under
the
plain
text
of
the
statute,
that
individual
would
be
barred
access
to
federal
district
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
respectfully,
justice
breyer,
that's
not
our
position,
because
texas
state
law--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--provides
court
review,
and
so
that
individual
could
raise
a
claim
in
state
court,
and
the
state
proceeding
does
not
require
that
it
had
been
raised
previously,
and
this
court
would
have
certiorari
jurisdiction
over
any
decision
from
federal...
from
state
court
rejecting
that
claim.
so
there
is
court
review
in
addition
to
original
habeas
actions
filed
before
this
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
correct.
the
constitution
doesn't
require
federal
district
courts.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
court
court
do
see.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
court
could
do
so--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--yes,
we
would.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
because
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
standards
for
an
original
habeas
corpus
are
particularly
exacting
and
are
informed
by
the
legislation
congress
has
passed
governing
habeas,
and
in
particular
section
2254.
section
2254
in
our
judgment
provides
the
simplest
and
clearest
path
to
resolve
this
case,
and
it
doesn't
resolve
dealing
with
legislation
that
admittedly
is
in
some
tension
with
the
most
practical
and
efficient
course.
section
2254
requires
that
in
2004,
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
proceedings,
that
the
only
way
that
the
judgment
can
be
set
aside
is
if
it
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
law
by
this
court.
in
our
judgment,
no
fair
reading
of
ford
can
yield
such
an
outcome.
panetti
points
to
two
aspects
of
the
state
court
hearing
that
he
finds
fault
with:
first,
that
it
was
not
a
live
evidentiary
hearing;
and
second
that
the
state
did
not
appoint
a
psychiatrist
for
him
and
pay
for
it.
neither
of
those
are
consistent
with
the
holdings
of
ford.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
no
evidentiary
hearing,
justice
powell's
controlling
concurrence
was
explicit.
ordinary
adversarial
procedures
complete
with
live
testimony,
cross-examination,
and
oral
argument
by
counsel
are
not
necessarily
the
best
means.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
souter,
there
was
a
means.
in
fact,
the
state
court
explicitly
invited
him
to
respond.
he
did
in
fact
respond.
he
filed
a
20-page
objection,
a
detailed
objection.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct,
but
that
leads
to
the
second
argument
that
the
state
should
have
paid
for
a
psychiatrist.
that
may
perhaps
make
sense
as
a
prospective
rule,
but
to
do
so
would
require
extending
the
rule
of
eight
to
habeas,
to
which
it
has
never
been
extended,
and
extending
it
in
particular
to
competency
hearing
on
execution.
that
would
be
a
new
rule
under
teague,
and
the
plurality
in
ford
explicitly
suggested
extending
ake
to
these
circumstances,
and
justice
powell
did
not
join
that
proposition.
and
so
in
my
judgment,
there
is
no
fair
way
to
read
ford
to
say
a
plurality
that
didn't
control
clearly
established
a
holding
that
ake
extended
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
i
would
frame
the
holding
a
little
more
narrowly,
and
i
would
use
justice
powell's
words
because
his
was
the
controlling
concurrence.
and
what
he
said
is,
"the
state
should
provide
an
impartial
officer
aboard
that
can
receive
evidence
and
argument
from
the
prisoner's
counsel.
"
and
so
"receive",
i
would
suggest
is
the
critical
word
there.
the
ford
situation
was
very
strange.
in
florida
the
governor
had
refused
to
accept
any
submissions
from
counsel,
said
i
won't
read
anything
your
psychiatrist
submits.
that
was
the
principal
failing
ford
focused
on.
in
this
case
the
district
court
asked
for
a
response,
received
a
20-page
written
response,
received
an
expert
psychiatric
report
that
was
obtained
by
counsel.
on
any
level,
it
satisfied
the
holding
of
ford.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
the
argument
that
you
suggest,
panetti
has
at
no
point
made
an
argument
that
substantively
the
state
court
decision
violated
clearly
established
law.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
because
there
is
no
clearly
established
law
on
what
the
standard
is
for
competency.
in
ford,
there
was
one
justice
writing
alone,
because
justice
powell
was
not
joined
by
anyone,
and
his
opinion
was
not
controlling
on
the
standard
for
incompetency.
it
was
solely--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
kennedy,
we
agree
with
the
proposition
that
executing
the
insane
is
unconstitutional.
that
was
a
holding
of
ford.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
test
is
very
close
to
the
test
the
state
proposes.
what
panetti
is
endeavoring
to
do
is
to
incorporate
into
the
test
rational
understanding,
which
is
deliberately
borrowed
from
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
concerning
competency
to
waive
counsel
and
to
stand
trial,
and
we
would
suggest
is
a
standard
wholly
inappropriate
to
this
circumstance.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
this
case,
panetti
satisfies
that
test.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there's
no
reason
to
do
so.
because
the
district
court's
factual
findings
demonstrate
conclusively
that
panetti
meets
the
appropriate
test
for
competency
to
be
executed.
the
district
court
found
that
panetti
understands
he
committed
these
two
murders.
he
knows
that
he
murdered
two
people.
he
understand
that
he
is
going
to
be
put
to
death.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
it
extends
a
little
further
than
there
in
that
the
test
that
panetti
possess
rational
understanding
is
found
nowhere
in
any
holding
from
this
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
as
an
initial
matter,
i
do
not
believe
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
reach
it
because
of
2254,
because
of
the
proceedings
that
on
any
level
comply
with
clearly
established
holdings
from
ford.
the
only
way
panetti
gets
there
is
by
extending
ake
to
these
proceeding,
and
no
court
holding
has
ever
so
done.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes.
and
justice
kennedy,
i
agree
with
you.
and
in
fact,
under
aedpa--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
agree
with
you
that
the
better
course
if
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
would
have
been
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
had
discretion--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
believe
he
had
to
do
that.
i
don't
believe
he
had
discretion.
i
believe
that's
what
the
district
court
had
to
do,
because
section
(e)(2)(b)
of
aedpa,
which
is
the
proceedings,
the
rules
governing
when
the
district
court
can
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing,
require
the
exact
same
thing
that
2244
requires,
namely
that
the
claim
go
to
the
underlying
guilt
of
the
offense.
so
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
had
the
authority
under
aedpa
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
the
district
court
concludes
the
proceedings
didn't
satisfy
ford,
the
remedy
would
to
be
send
that
back.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
that
circumstance,
if
the
underlying
failure,
the
unconstitutional
action,
is
a
failure
to
provide
enough
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
i
agree
with
your
suggestion
that
the
better
course
of
action,
the
course
consistent
with
aedpa,
is
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
to
provide
that
procedure.
but
even
if
this
court
thinks
prospectively
that
extending
ake
to
these
circumstances
is
a
good
rule,
there
is
not
a
word
in
ford
that
so
holds.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
not
the
case,
and
in
fact
aedpa
provides
the
federal
district
court
can
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
consider
new
facts
if
the
claim
goes
to
the
underlying
guilt
of
the
offense.
this
particular--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--technically
speaking,
the
way
federal
district
courts
do
this
is
they
issue
the
writ
conditioned,
conditional
upon
the
district
court--
holding,
or
the
state
court
holding
the
hearing.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
so
i
don't
disagree
with
you
that
it's
functioning
not
that
different
from
an
appellate
court,
but
through
the
formalism
of
issuing
a
conditional
writ.
turning
to
the
merits
or
returning
to
the
merits,
there
was
a
square
factual
finding
that
panetti
knows
that
he's
been
sentenced
to
death
for
committing
these
murders,
and
an
additional
factual
finding
that
he
has
the
capacity
to
understand
the
reason
for
that.
the
district
court
didn't
resolve
whether
he,
in
fact,
understands
the
reason
for
it,
although
the
state
court
did.
the
state
court
explicitly
concluded
that
he
in
fact
understands
the
reason.
the
circumstance
we
have
here
is
exactly
the
circumstance
suggested
by
justice
souter's
hypothetical.
you
have
an
individual
who
knows
he
committed
a
crime,
knows
he's
going
to
die,
knows
that
he
is...
the
state
is
going
to
execute
him
because
he
committed
the
crime,
but
he
doesn't
believe
that
reason.
he
at
least
asserts
he
believes
something
else
is
going
on.
but
nothing
in
this
court's
precedents
or
nothing
in
the
principles
behind
the
eighth
amendment
require
a
prisoner
to
believe
the
state's
motivation.
it
is
enough
that
he
is
able
to
prepare
to
die,
and
the
central
focus
justice
powell
focused
on
was
the
ability
to
prepare
oneself
to
die.
panetti
knows
he's
going
to
be
put
to
death.
there's
an
exchange
in
the
record
with
respect
to
one
of
his
experts
where
he
was
talking
about
other
executions.
and
in
particular
he
goes
through
with
dr.
mary
alice
conroy
on
page
148
of
the
joint
appendix,
he's
talking
about
what
happens
when
other
people
are
executed.
and
he
says,
you
know,
well,
they
go
to
be
executed
and
then
sometimes
they
get
a
stay,
and
when
they
get
a
stay
they
come
back,
and
when
they
don't
get
a
stay,
well,
then
they
go
on
either
to
be
with
the
lord
or
someplace
too
horrible
to
talk
about.
and
his
understanding
of
that
is
in
marked
contrast
to
alvin
ford's.
alvin
ford
is
the
simplest
and
clearest
metric
to
compare
an
individual
defendant.
alvin
ford
didn't
know
he
was
going
to
be
executed.
he
was
unaware
of
what
was
going
on.
and
this
court
concluded
in
ford
that
it
was
cruel
and
irrational
to
subject
someone
who
had
no
idea
what
was
coming
to
the
death
penalty.
here
panetti
knows
he's
going
to
die
and
he
also
knows
he's
guilty.
so
in
terms
of
preparing
for
death,
he
can
make
his
peace
with
the
lord,
he
can
make
his
peace
with
the
victim's
family,
he
can
prepare
for
death.
he
may
in
fact
not
believe
the
state's
reasons,
although
it's
worth
noting
that
no
court
has
ever
so
held.
what
the
federal
district
court
said
is
that
his
experts
state
that
he
doesn't
believe
the
reasons.
but
on
the
other
side,
no
fewer
than
six
different
professional
psychiatrists
have
concluded
that
panetti
is
deliberately
exaggerating
his
symptoms,
that
he
is
malingering,
that
he's
acting
bizarre
in
order
to
appear
more
insane.
and
that
presents
a
very
difficult
factual
question.
what
do
you
do
with
someone
who
plainly
has
some
mental
illness,
but
at
the
same
time
whom
six
psychiatrists
who
have
studied
him,
in
some
cases
for
years,
who
have
treated
him
for
years,
six
professional
psychiatrists
come
in
and
tell
the
district
court
this
individual
is
exaggerating?
that
is
an
incredibly
difficult
factual
matter.
the
only
way
our
system
can
deal
with
it
is
to
let
the
factfinder
hear
the
competing
experts
and
make
a
judgment.
in
this
case,
the
federal
district
court
concluded
that
the
evidence
of
malingering,
quote,
"casts
doubt
on
the
extent
of
panetti's
mental
illness
and
symptoms.
"
and
that's
at
page
363
of
the
joint
appendix.
rather
than
resolve
the
question
whether
he
in
fact
doesn't
believe
the
state's
reasons,
what
the
district
court
said
is
the
constitution
doesn't
require
that
he
believe
the
state's
reasons.
the
constitution
simply
requires
that
he
know
what
is
happening,
that
he
understand
what
is
happening.
the
test
we
have
proposed
focusing
on
two
things.
one,
capacity,
which
panetti
now
agrees;
and
the
second
thing
we
suggest
is
the
test
should
be
whether
a
defendant
can
recognize
he's
going
to
die
and
the
reason.
and
"recognize",
we
submit
is
consistent
with
the
words
justice
powell
used,
justice
powell
used
the
words
"understand",
"aware
of",
and
"perceive".
and
so
recognize
was
our
attempt
to
capture
what
justice
powell
was
talking
about.
it
is
less
than
rational
understanding,
it
is
less
than
the
full
panoply
of
being
able
to
make
all
the
litigation
decisions
one
is
required,
say,
to
waive
counsel;
because
as
panetti
concedes
in
his
reply
brief,
there
are
no
strategic
decisions
remaining
to
be
made.
at
the
time
of
execution,
all
that
remains
is
for
him
to
make
peace
and
move
on
so
that
the
state
may
execute
a
justly
entered
sentence.
that
test,
we
submit,
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
it
furthers
both
retribution
and
deterrence.
one
point
on
deterrence.
the
test
panetti
points
out
really
invites
abuse.
because
rational
understanding
is...
is
a
standard
that,
particularly
when
you
think
about
mental
illness
and
the
ability
through
medications
of
an
individual
to
affirmatively
decide
to
stop
taking
medications
and
exacerbate
his
symptom,
it
invites
real
abuse.
because
rational
standard
we
would...
or
rational
understanding
we
would
suggest
is
too
high
of
a
standard.
in
our
prisons
there
are
unfortunately
a
great
many
people
suffering
from
some
degree
of
mental
illness.
at
some
level
that's
unsurprising.
if
you
look
at
the
dsm-iv
definition
of
sociopathy--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we...
we
have
litigated
cases
where
people
have
raised
ford
claims.
in
fact
one
of
the
ones
we
recently
litigated
involved
an
individual
who
was
convinced
he
was
on
death
row
and
being
executed
because
there
was
a
conspiracy
of
jews
and
homosexuals
that
was
out
to
get
them...
out
to
get
him.
that
sort
of
delusion
unfortunately
is
not
uncommon
on
death
row
and
it
is
not
uncommon
in
prisons
for
paranoia...
the
testimony
of
one
of
panetti's
experts,
doctor
conroy
said,
quote,
"the
major
portion
of
our
population
in
our
in-patient
units
are
diagnosed
with
some
form
of
schizophrenia.
"
if
you
think
of
sociopathy,
which
is
defined
as...
quote...
under
the
dsm-iv,
"a
lack
of
regard
for
moral
or
legal
standards
in
the
local
culture.
"
it
is
unsurprising
that
people
that
have
a
lack
of
regard
for
right
and
wrong,
a
lack
of
regard
for
others'
lives,
frequently
commit
crimes
in
which
they
murder
and
injure
other
people.
and
yet
our
criminal
justice
system
is
predicated
upon
holding
people
to
account
unless
they
meet
the
standards
for
legal
insanity.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
we
have
endeavored
to
compile
those
statistics
and
that
has
been...
we
don't
have
any
for
the
court.
one
difficulty
is
in
practice
sometimes
the
state
will
not
seek
death.
often
these
are
unreported
decisions
across
the
state.
so
unfortunately
we
don't
have
those
statistics,
although
we
did
endeavor
to
compile
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
