mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
scott
panetti
suffers
from
paranoid
delusions
that
cause
him
to
believe
that
he
is
being
executed
because
of
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
not
as
punishment
for
his
crimes.
despite
that
finding,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
scott
panetti
is
competent
to
be
executed
because
an
inmate
need
not
have
a
rational
understanding
of
the
reason
for
his
execution
but
only
be
aware
of
it.
this
standard
is
a
profound
misreading
of
ford
versus
wainwright
but
before
i
address
the
merits
of
that
issue,
i
would
like
to
discuss
two
preliminary
matters
first.
first,
scott
panetti's
petition
containing
his
execution
competency
claim
is
not
second
or
successive
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act.
and
second,
the
state
court
adjudication
of
that
claim
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
this
court.
the
first
issue:
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
petition.
martinez-villareal
recognized
that
a
numerically
second
petition
is
not
successive,
it's
not
a
mere
mathematical
computation,
it's
a
term
of
art.
and
if
you
bring
the
claim
the
first
time
it's
justiciable,
it's
not
second
or
successive.
texas
law--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--your
honor,
i
think
the
difference
is,
or
the
central
holding,
i
believe,
of
martinez-villareal
is
that
we
do
not
bring
these
ford
claims
until
they
are
justiciable,
until
they're
ripe.
it's
the
unique
nature
of
ford
claims.
they
are
uniquely
time
specific.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
martinez-villareal
did
not
resolve
that
question,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
other
problem
with
the
case,
i
think,
is
as
you
suggest,
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
a
real
danger
that
these
claims
could
be
adjudicated
prematurely.
and
that
has
happened
in
the
fifth
circuit,
a
case
that
both
the
state
and
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
valdez
versus
cockrell.
and
that
was
a
post
martinez-villareal
case.
the
other
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
texas
law
believes
that
these
claims
are
premature
as
well.
so
it
was
premature
under
martinez-villareal,
but
it
was
also
unexhausted
and
unexhaustible
under
texas
law.
and
i
think
what
martinez-villareal
and
texas
recognize
together
is
that
these
claims
are
most
efficiently
litigated
at
the
end
of
the
process,
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
these
claims.
the
constitutional
violation
here
is
forward
looking,
unlike
most
constitutional
habeas
claims
that
are
backward
looking.
and
it's
the
state's
setting
of
the
date
or
making
it
imminent
that
triggers
the
violation,
that
it
is
now
going
to
carry
out
the
execution
of
someone
who
is
potentially
mentally
incompetent.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
my
answer
would
be
that
the
court
didn't
make
the
mere
mathematical
calculation
in
martinez-villareal.
that
claim
actually
was
raised
twice.
it
was
raised
in
the
first
petition,
and
it
was
raised
in
a
second
when
it
was
ripe.
we've
only
brought
our
ford
claim
one
time.
we
brought
it
when
it
was
ripe,
when
the
execution
date
was
set.
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
there.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
claim
in
a
sense
doesn't
even
exist
until
the
state
is
announcing
its
intention
to
carry
out
the
execution
in
the
near
future
by
setting
the
date.
and
if
we
adopt
the
rule
that
the
state
wants,
it's
going
to
have,
as
in
martinez-villareal,
perverse
and
seemingly
far-reaching
consequences
for
habeas
practice.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
think
that
is
definitely
part
of
it,
your
honor,
but
it
also
is
the
fact
that
we
cannot
predict
with
any
reliability
how
severe
mental
illnesses
are
going
to
influence
somebody's
mental
processes.
and
the
nature
of
delusions
themselves
that
fluctuate
in
intensity
and
severity,
often
influenced
by
life
events,
can
have
an
impact
on
the
inmate's
ability
to
understand
the
reason
for
his
execution.
in
this
case
it
is,
his
delusion
is
wrapped
up,
it's
central
to
it,
as
the
reason
he's
being
executed.
and
the
intensity
of
his
delusions
or
our
ability
to
predict
that
is...
we
can't
do
it
until
that
event
actually
occurs,
the
event
that's
going
to
influence
him,
and
that's
the
setting
of
the
date.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
don't
think
we
could
have
fit
under
that
provision,
your
honor,
because
that
provision
requires
that
the
evidence,
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
but
for
constitutional
error,
no
reasonable
fact
finder
would
have
found
the
applicant
guilty
of
the
underlying
offense.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
that's
part
of
the
justification,
but
it's
actually
i
think
more
than
that,
that
the
claim
isn't
justiciable,
that
the
claim
doesn't
exist.
i
think
it
would
be
as
if
trying
to
force
a
petitioner
to
raise,
who's
attacking
a
sentence
of
a
number
of
years,
to
raise
in
that
petition
deprivation
of
good
time
credits,
that
there
would
be
no
claim
at
that
point
for
them
to
raise
it.
so
it's
the
justiciability,
i
think,
is--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--the
facts
aren't
present,
but
the
constitutional
violation
has
already
occurred,
and
i
think
that's
got
to
be
the
difference.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
correct.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
right.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
would
think
it's
the
latter,
your
honor.
the
state
would
argue--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i...
i
would
think
not.
i
mean
it's,
the
exhaustion
remedy
or
the
due
process
constitutional
requirements
were
not
met
by
the
state
court
judge,
and
they
had
their
opportunity.
they
didn't
live
up
to
the
ford
procedures,
and
now
we've
had
a
full,
constitutionally
adequate
procedure
in
federal
court
and
we
developed
those
facts.
the
only
thing
we
really
need
now
is
a
standard
from
this
court
and
we
can
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
apply
that
legal
standard.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
but
our
contention
is
that
the
aedpa
does
not
prevent
this
court
from
addressing
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue
here.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
because
the
state
court
did
not
abide
by
the
minimum
due
process
procedures
set
out
by
justice
powell's
opinion
in
ford
versus
wainwright,
and
that
is
the
clearly
established
law
even
though
it
is
a
concurring
opinion.
he
does
not
provide
as
much
due
process
protections
as
justice
marshall's
plurality
did.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
yes.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
you
don't
have
to
overrule
burton,
your
honor.
burton
is
distinguishable;
burton
had
two
or
more
petitions
attacking
the
same
custody
of
the
same
judgment.
the
nature
of
the
ford
claim
is
not
that
we
are
telling
the
state
that
they
cannot
carry
out
the
execution
of
mr.
panetti.
we
are
just
saying
they
cannot
carry
it
out
under
a
limited
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
burton,
on
the
other
hand,
could
have
raised
all
of
his
claims
at
the
same
time,
but
he...
he
went
ahead
and
raised
his
conviction...
claims
related
to
his
conviction
before
he
raised
his
claims
related
to
his
sentencing.
if
we
had
done
that,
if
we
had
waited
until
the
ford
claim
was
ripe,
all
of
our
usual
type
habeas
claims
would
have
been
lost
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
in
burton.
to
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
here...
let
me
just
say,
the
essential
language
of
justice
powell's
decision
on
the
minimum
due
process
requirements
is
that,
number
one,
an
impartial
decision-maker
is
required;
and
secondly,
that
decision-maker
has
to
have
the
ability
to
hear
argument
and
receive
evidence
from
prisoner's
counsel,
including
expert
psychiatric
evidence
that
may
differ
from
the
state's
own
psychiatric
examinations.
that
boils
down
to
exactly
what
we
didn't
have
here.
now
the
key
point
is
when
the
state's
or
the
court's
appointed
experts
went
to
evaluate
mr.
panetti,
new
issues
were
raised;
and
those
are
the
issues,
they
were
determinative
issues,
that
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to.
what
happened
is
when
they
went
to
see
mr.
panetti,
they
characterized
his
behavior
as
filibustering
about
the
bible,
answering
questions
with
biblical
verses,
refusing
to
answer
questions
until
they
told
him
whether
or
not
they
were
christians.
they
took
all
of
those
behaviors
to
mean
that
mr.
panetti
was
controlling,
manipulating
and
deliberately
refusing
to
answer
questions,
leading
them
to
the
conclusion
that
mr.
panetti
was
competent
and
he
was
just
malingering.
that
is
exactly
the
type
of
evidence
that
we
were
not
able
to
respond
to.
we
asked
in
a
number
of
ways
throughout
the
state
court
proceedings
to
the
trial
judge,
please,
give
us
an
opportunity
of
some
sort
to
address
the
issues,
to
make
this
proceeding
fair.
and
these...
these
procedures
that
we
asked
for
included
cross-examination
at
a
hearing
and
also
funds
to
hire
our
own
defense
expert.
it's
important
to
point
out
that
our
pro
bono
attorney
who...
i'm
sorry,
our
pro
bono
expert
who
did
an
emergency
evaluation
two
days
before
the
execution,
was
not
a
constitutionally
adequate
procedure.
the
reason
is
clear.
the
state
court-appointed
attorneys...
i'm
sorry,
experts,
had
not
yet
been
appointed,
and
they
had
not
yet
done
their
evaluation.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
yes.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
we
do
not
have
to
have
that.
what
we
do
have
to
have
in
a
situation
like
ours
where
there
is
a
new
issue
that
is
brought
up
by
the
charges
of,
basically
malingering,
that
we
have
got
to
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges,
and
engage
that
issue;
and
we
were
not
able
to
engage
that
issue;
and
we
asked
for
intermediate
steps.
the
other
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
is
that
the
texas
procedure
itself
allows
for
a
hearing.
that's
how
they
comport
with
ford.
so
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
texas's
procedures.
what
happened
here
is
a
maverick
judge
decided
not
to
follow
the
statute.
and
so
it
was
specifically
to
our
case.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
and
we're
not
asking
for
that,
your
honor.
we're
asking
for
something
intermediate
to
that.
it
could
have,
like
i
said,
it
could
have
been
resolved
by
having
the
opportunity
to
have
our
own
expert
especially
in
a
situation
where
new
issues
are
raised.
i
would
contrast
that
with
a
situation
where
our
pro
bono
expert
had
sent
out
a
report;
we
overcame
the
threshold
showing
that
was
necessary;
two
mental
health
experts
are
appointed
under
the
statute,
and
those
experts
addressed
our
experts'
report
and
didn't
raise
any
new
issues,
didn't
bring
anything
new
into
the
mix,
but
what
was
brought
into
the
mix
here
is
the
malingering
charge.
and
i
should
add--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--we
had
a
pro
bono
expert--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--who--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--allowed
us,
but
we,
we
went
back
to
the
well
and
he
was
not
able
to
help
us
anymore
after
that
initial
threshold
showing
that
we
made.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
our
position
was
vindicated
when
we
finally
did
get
constitutionally
adequate
procedures.
because
what
happened
was
this
federal
district
court
judge
found
that
scott
panetti
does
suffer
from
a
mental
illness
and
it
is
significantly
characterized
by
a
delusional
belief
system
in
which
he
believes
himself
to
be
persecuted
for
his
religious
activities
and
beliefs.
so--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--that's
right.
we
had
a
full
hearing.
so
we
did
more
than
just
submit
affidavits
from
our
experts.
but
that
did
vindicate
our
position,
your
honor,
yes.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
merits.
the
test
for
competency
that
we
have
proposed
is
derived
directly
from
justice
powell's
test
that
he
set
out
in
his
concurrence
in
ford
versus
wainwright.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--that's
not
what
justice
powell
did.
i
mean,
what
happened
in
ford
is
that
the
court
did
look
at
all
of
the
common
law
rationales
for
the
ban,
the
common
law
ban
on
executing
the
incompetent.
and
those
rationales
were
also
set
out
in
justice
powell's
opinion,
and
they...
the
court...
a
majority
of
this
court
agreed
with
certain
of
those
rationales.
the
two
rationales
being
that
execution
of
the
mentally
incompetent
does
not
further
the
retributive
goal
of
capital
punishment,
and
secondly,
that
it's
simply
cruel
to
execute
someone
who
does
not
have
the
ability
to
take
comfort
of
understanding,
to
prepare
spiritually
and
mentally
for
his
passing.
so
the
basis
for
this
standard--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
think
that's
the
very
nature
of
the
ford
right,
that
it
is
something
that
intervenes.
we're
not
saying
that
scott
panetti
was
not
fully
culpable,
found
guilty,
sentenced
to
death;
we're
not
attacking
that
at
all.
something
happened.
and
what
happened
was
he
did
lose
the
ability
to
understand
rationally
the
connection
between
his
crime--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
your
honor,
because
number
one,
we
don't
have
a
common
law
heritage
stretching
back
a
thousand
years
to
prevent
the
incapacitation
or
the
incarceration
of
the
mentally
incompetent.
and
i
think
the
difference
also
is--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--excuse
me?
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
the...
the
difference,
though,
i
think,
is
if
you're
going
to
incarcerate
somebody
or
incapacitate
them,
we're
not
concerned
with
their
mental
state.
all
we
are
trying
to
do
at
that
point
is
deter
them
from
committing
other
crimes.
so
i
don't
think
it's
the
same
situation
here.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
in
capital
punishment,
yes,
but
i
guess
i'm
responding
to
your
hypothetical,
a
person
who
is
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
who
is
mentally
incompetent,
and
i
would
think
that
the
main
goal
there
is
incapacitation,
deterrence.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
i
think
the
key
point
here
is
that
the
person
must
be
suffering
from
a
mental
illness;
and
it
is
that
mental
illness
that
has
to
deprive
the
person
of
his
capacity
to
understand
the
connection
between
his
crime
and
his
punishment.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
would
say
that
person
does
not.
and
the
reason
being
if
the
person
in
your
hypothetical
is
suffering
from
a
mental
illness,
and
these
mental
illnesses
are
very
small
fraction
of
the
type
that
include
delusions,
distortions
in
thought
content,
distortions
in
perception,
distortions
in
thinking,
that
those
very
things
prevent
them
from
being
reasoned
out
of
their
delusion
by
the
facts
that
you've
suggested.
if
they
take
those
facts,
such
as
scott
panetti,
that
he
knows
the
state's
purported
reason
for
his
execution,
but
that's
not
good
enough.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
think
the
difference
in
your
hypothetical
has
to
be,
your
honor,
that
it's
the
crime
itself.
it's
not
the
conviction.
it's
the
crime,
that
this
person
has
a
rational
understanding
to
connect
his
crime
to
his
punishment.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
no,
not
that
he
does
not--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
the
difference
is
that
again
it
has
to
be
the
product
of
a
mental
illness,
and
then
that
mental
illness
has
to
deprive
the
person
of
that
capacity.
so
if
it's
somebody
who
just
thinks
they've
been--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
think
the
difference
has
to
be,
your
honor,
that,
yes,
he
has
suffered
from
a
delusion
for
20
years
and
that's
the
spiritual
warfare
between
himself
and
the
devil.
but
the
delusion
takes
on
a
different
form
in
the
sense
of
when
his
execution
date
was
approaching
it's
now
the
culmination
of
this
battle
between
himself
and
satan,
and
that
is
something
that
we
can't
predict
with
any
sort
of
reliability
years
in
advance
of
the
date.
he
didn't
get
his
first
date
until
four
years
after
his
first
federal
petition
was
filed.
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
wouldn't
say
that
the
delusion
itself
is
changing.
i
mean,
the
delusion
is
there,
but
it's
taken
a
specific
form
of--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
again,
i
don't
think
we
can
predict
that
with
any
reliability
because
of
the
nature
of
delusions,
the
severity,
the
intensity
fluctuating;
that
until
that
event,
until
that
execution
date
is
set
and
is
imminent
there
is
no
reliable
way
of
predicting
how
it's
going
to
affect
his
thinking,
how
it's
going
to
affect
his
ability.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
thank
you.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you.
the,
the
only
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
we're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
fraction
of
serious
mental
illnesses
here.
we're
talking
about
people
who
have
distortions
in
thought
content,
distortions
in
perception,
distortions
in
their
thinking
processes.
this
is
not
the
vast
majority
of
people
on
death
row,
and
it
is,
certainly,
i
have
seen
no
one
as
mentally
ill
as
scott
panetti.
there
are
very
few
people
that
would
be
compared
to
him.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
i
think
it
has
to
be
a
mental
illness...
again
i
would
come
back
to
the
fact
that
the
mental
illness
has
to
deprive
the
person
of
the
capacity
to
make
that
rational
understanding,
and
that's
why
delusional
behavior
is
crucial
in
most
of
these
cases
to
depriving
that
person
of
the
capacity.
because
even
if
you
tell
the
person
they're
being
executed
for
the
crimes
they've
committed,
that
is
not
enough
to
talk
them
out
of
their
delusion.
it
is
not
enough
to
reason
them
out
of
their
delusion.
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
he
has
to
have
a
rational
understanding
that
he
is
being
executed
precisely
because
of
the
crime
that
he
committed.
he...
the
district
court
never
found
that
he
had
that.
that
he
had
an
understanding
or
that
he
was
aware
of
the
state's
it's
stated
reason
for
his
execution,
and
that
stated
reason
becomes--
mr.
gregory
w.
wiercioch
--i
would
disagree
your
honor.
what
it
is
is
if
he
is
suffering
from
a
mental
illness
that
deprives
him
of
that
capacity.
so
someone
with
antisocial
personality
disorder,
something
of
that
nature,
where
none
of
the
features
of
that
disorder
implicate
distortions
in
thought
process,
thought
content
or
perceptions,
it's
not...
it's
going
to
have
that
capacity
but
they
just
refuse
to
accept
the
state's
reasons.
