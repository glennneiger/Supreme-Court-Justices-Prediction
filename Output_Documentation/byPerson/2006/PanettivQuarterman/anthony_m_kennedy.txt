justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
material
to
your
position
to
show
that
there
was
deterioration
in
his
mental
condition
between
the
time
of
the
sentence
and
the
time
you
brought
the
petition?
i.e.,
the...
during
his
incarceration,
his
condition
worsened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
if
you
get
beyond
the
second
or
successive
question,
your
next
point
was
whether
or
not
aedpa
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
could
you
answer
this:
suppose
we
find
that
the
state
did
not
comply
with
the
mandate
of
ford
because
it
didn't
give
adequate
procedures
to
the
defendant,
it
did
not
give
him
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
his
defense.
suppose
we
find
that.
i'm
going
to
ask
the
same
question
of
the
state.
does
that
mean
that
the
district
court
should
then
send
it
back
to
the
state?
or
is
the
district
court
at
that
point
entitled
and
required
to
hold
a
new
hearing
on
the
substantive
issue
of
ford
competency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
send
it
back
to
the
state?
and
say
well,
now
you
didn't
give
the
correct
procedures
and
that's...
an
invalidity.
so
we're
sending
it
back
to
you.
would
the
district
court
have
discretion
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
may
be
much
harder
for
you
to
get
that
standard
on
this
court's
review
of
a
collateral
proceeding
than
this
court's
review
of
a
state
proceeding,
because
of
aedpa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
that
the
affidavit
submitted
to
the
district
court
by
the
psychiatrists
are
sufficient
to
vindicate
your
substantive
position
that
he
cannot
be
executed
under
ford?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
gave
him
one
week
and
there
were
no
funds
for
his
own
psychiatrist.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
agree
that
ford
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
that
meets
the
essentials
of
fairness
so
that
the
defendant
can
contradict
the
hearings
that...
the
conclusions
of
the
state-appointed
psychiatrist?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
did
understand
counsel's
argument
to
say
that
relief
must
be
given,
he
cannot
be
executed,
if
he
lacks
the
capacity
to
form
a
rational
understanding
of
the
nature
and
justification
for
the
punishment.
you,
i
take
it,
would
agree
that
if
we
can
just
use
the
lay
term,
you
cannot
execute
an
insane
person
if
he
is
grossly
psychotic,
and
you
can't
execute
a
comatose
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we're
talking
about
what
insane
means,
and
that's
a
lay
term.
so
suppose
there's
a
gross
psychosis
which
is
a
severe
disorientation
from
reality
and
from
rationality,
and
he
cannot
understand,
and
he
lacks
the
capacity
to
understand
the
nature
and
the
justification
for
his
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
different
from
having
a
rational
capacity
to
understand
the
nature
and
justification
for
the
punishment.
i
think
it
is.
i
would
conclude
it's
a
fair
conclusion
from
the
psychiatrist's
affidavits
and
from
their
testimony,
that
he
knows
he
committed
a
crime,
he
knows
he's
being
punished,
and
he's
going
to
be
executed
for
that
crime.
but
it
stops
there.
the
delusions
prevent
his
understanding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
really
do
need
your
help
on
a
procedural
part
of
aedpa.
let's
assume...
i
know
that
you
don't
agree
with
it...
let's
assume
that
the
state
erred
because
it
gave
inadequate
procedures
to
the
defendant
with
reference
to
the
adjudication
of
competency
to
be
executed.
let's
assume
that.
would
the
district
court
have
had
discretion,
if
it
made
that
finding,
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
state
court
to
have
new
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
asking
the
question.
so
don't
agree
with
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
had
discretion
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
assuming
he
made
that
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
do
if
there's
incompetency
of
counsel
in
a
routine,
not
a
death
case,
incompetency
of
counsel,
and
the
district
court
finds
incompetency
of
counsel?
it
then
goes
ahead
and
he
hears
all
of
the
issues
that
a
competent
counsel
would
have
addressed,
or
it
sends
back
to
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
experience
and
in
your
present
position,
have
you
seen
many
condemned
people
with
the
symptoms
as
severe
as
this
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
suppose
you
have
statistics
of
how
many
have
been
sentenced
to
death
and
have
later
been
found
incompetent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
opinion
i
have
to
announce
for
the
court
is
06-6407,
panetti
versus
quarterman.
scott
louis
panetti
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
sentenced
to
death
at
texas
state
court.
he
argues
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
psychotic
disorder
he
is
presently
incompetent
to
be
executed.
the
procedure
history
the
case
has
setout
in
some
detail
in
the
opinion
it
is
sufficed
to
say
here
that
the
petitioner
filed
a
first
federal
habeas
petition
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
that
first
petition
he
did
not
allege
incompetency
to
be
executed
and
that
petition
was
denied.
later
after
the
state
of
texas
set
an
execution
date
he
alleged
his
present
incompetency
and
proceeded
that
the
outset
and
the
state
court,
the
state
court
considered
the
matter
ruled
against
him.
petitioner
then
returned
to
the
united
states
district
court
with
a
second
habeas
petition,
this
time
he
alleged
his
incompetency
to
be
executed.
the
district
court
took
evidence
on
the
issue
and
it
heard
from
expert
witnesses
on
behalf
of
both
the
petitioner
and
the
state
of
texas.
siding
the
controlling
precedence
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
the
trial
court
ruled
the
petitioner
had
not
shown
incompetency
to
be
executed,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
before
reaching
the
question
of
how
to
define
or
determine
competency
to
be
executed
is
required
under
the
precedence,
our
opinion
discusses
various
procedural
issues
that
are
presented
in
the
case
and
they
are
substantial
procedural
issues.
first,
the
state
argues
that
this
habeas
corpus
petition
is
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
petition
and
it
is
barred
another
provisions
of
the
federal
aedpa
statute
certified
at
28
usc
section
2244.
we
reject
that
contention,
it
is
true
that
in
a
usual
case
of
petition
filed
for
second
time
will
not
survive
the
statutory
bar
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
however.
the
difficulty
with
requiring
a
prisoner
to
allege
incompetency
to
be
executed
when
the
first
petition
is
filed
is
that
his
execution
date
may
not
have
been
set
and
his
mental
condition
may
not
yet
be
called
in
question.
but
we
too
accept
the
state’s
arguments
those
claims
would
have
to
be
filed
before
they
became
right
any
prisoner
wishing
to
preserve
the
ability
to
prove
later
incompetency
to
be
executed
will
be
forced
to
file
an
empty
formality,
an
un
right
incompetence
claim
just
to
have
it
dismissed.
we
do
not
interpret
the
statute
in
the
manner
that
produces
these
wasteful
results
to
the
benefit
of
no
party.
we
hold
the
statutory
bar
on
second
or
successive
applications
does
not
apply
to
an
incompetency
claim
brought
in
an
application
filed
in
the
claimers
first
right
and
so
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
petitioner’s
claim.
another
procedural
question
is
whether
the
federal
court
must
differ
to
the
state
court
finding
that
the
petitioner
was
confidant.
for
reasons
explained
some
length
in
the
opinion
we
find
that
the
procedures
followed
in
the
state
court
competency
proceedings
did
not
accord
with
the
minimum
requirements
for
those
hearings
setout
in
this
court’s
decision
in
a
case
called
ford
versus
wainwright
and
as
the
state
court
proceedings
were
so
deficient
as
they
constitute
an
unreasonable
application
of
law
that
this
court
has
already
set
down
we
need
not
refer
to
the
state
court’s
adjudication
and
that
brings
us
to
the
merits
of
the
claim.
again,
in
ford
versus
wainwright
this
court
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
a
state
from
carrying
out
a
sentence
of
death
upon
a
prisoner
who
is
insane
and
of
course
sanity
is
referred
to
in
the
legal
literature
now
as
“incompetence
as
oppose
to
competence.”
in
the
petitioner’s
case
he
knows
he
is
to
be
executed
and
he
knows
that
the
state
has
asserted
that
it
is
imposing
the
sentence
as
a
consequence
of
his
convictions
for
murder.
petitioner
alleges
that
even
so
he
suffers
from
severe
delusions
sustaining
from
mental
illness
which
deprive
him
of
the
ability
to
understand
the
states
asserted
reasons
for
its
execution.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
in
rejecting
this
claim
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
definition
of
incompetency
that
is
overly
restrictive
in
light
of
our
precedence.
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
which
earlier
had
ruled
in
reliance
on
the
precedents
of
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
prisoner’s
delusional
believes
do
not
bear
under
question
of
incompetency
so
long
as
the
prisoner
is
aware
of
the
state
asserted
reason
for
the
execution.
now
our
opinion
in
four
discussed
various
reasons
for
imposing
the
death
penalty
but
none
of
those
reasons
would
be
in
accord
with
the
court
of
appeals
rule
which
deems
delusions
are
relevant
only
with
respect
to
the
state
announced
reason
for
a
punishment
as
opposed
to
the
real
interest
that
the
state
seeks
to
vindicate.
just
to
take
one
example
of
the
retributive
rational
for
instance,
it
might
be
said
the
capital
punishment
is
imposed
because
it
has
the
potential
to
make
the
offender
recognize
at
last
the
gravity
of
his
crime,
and
to
allow
the
community
as
a
whole
including
the
surviving
family
and
friends
of
the
victim.
to
affirm
its
own
judgment
that
the
culpability
of
the
prisoner
is
so
serious
that
the
ultimate
penalty
must
be
sought
and
imposed.
these
objectives
are
call
in
question
however,
if
the
prisoner’s
mental
state
is
so
distorted
by
a
mental
illness
that
his
awareness
of
the
crime
and
punishment
has
a
little
or
no
relation
to
the
understanding
shared
by
the
community
as
a
whole.
gross
delusions
stemming
from
a
severe
mental
disorder
may
put
an
awareness
of
the
link
between
a
crime
and
its
punishment
in
the
context
so
far
removed
from
reality
that
the
punishment
can
serve
no
proper
purpose.
we
reject
the
analysis
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
the
same
analysis
which
formed
the
framework
for
the
hearing
of
the
district
court.
now
as
the
record
in
this
case
was
developed
pursuing
to
a
standard
we
found
to
be
improper,
we
find
it
difficult
at
this
time
to
amplify
our
conclusions
are
to
make
them
much
more
précised.
it
is
proper
to
allow
the
court
charged
with
overseen
the
development
of
the
evidentiary
record,
the
initial
opportunity
to
result
petitioner’s
constitutional
claims
in
light
of
our
opinion
today.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
descending
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
and
the
justices
scalia
and
alito
have
joined.
