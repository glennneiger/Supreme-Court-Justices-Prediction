chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-6407,
panetti
versus
quarterman.
mr.
wiercioch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
can't
you
have
sought
leave
to
file
a
second
or
successive
application
and
met
the
requirements,
if
you're
right
that
the
factual
predicate
for
the
ford
claim
doesn't
arise
until
the
execution
is
imminent?
couldn't
you
have
fit
your
claim
under
2244(b)(2)(b),
i
guess,
on
that
basis?
and
then
we
don't
have
to
engage
in
the
fiction
that
a
second
petition
is
actually
not
a
second
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it
doesn't
fit
comfortably
under
there,
but
i
guess
the
argument
would
be
that...
guilty
of...
we've
used
the
concept
of
being
guilty
of
the
death
sentence
as
opposed
to
guilty
of
the
crime
before,
and
the
fact
finder...
you
wouldn't
be
sentenced
to
death
if
the
sentencer
had
known
you
were
incompetent.
i
appreciate
that
it's
not
the
most
comfortable
fit,
but
at
least
the
part...
it
seems
to
be
addressed
to
the
question
of
a
factual
predicate
that's
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
first
habeas
petition.
and
that
seems
to
be
your
justification
for
not
filing
it
at
that
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
the
point
is
that
(b)(2)(b)
is
addressed
to
that
precise
situation
where
the
facts
aren't
present
when
you
file
the
first
application.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
constitutional
violation
won't
occur
until
the
execution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
prospective,
as
you
said?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
maybe
elaborate
on
that?
and
mean
if
you
have
someone
who
is
competent
at
the
time
they're
convicted,
competent
at
the
time
they're
sentenced,
and
you
say
they're
walking
to
the
gurney
to
be
executed,
you
know,
they
fall
and
hit
their
head
and
they
don't
understand
it,
it's
somehow
very
cruel
to
go
forward
with
the
execution
at
that
point,
while
it
wouldn't
have
been
before?
i...
it
seems
to
me,
i
mean,
obviously
competence
at
the
trial
and
sentencing
is
important.
i
just
don't
understand
the
concept
that
it
has
to
continue
to
the
point
of
execution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
does
he
understand
why
he's
being
imprisoned?
i
mean,
does
this,
the
ford
right
extend
to
prison?
is
it
cruel
to
keep
someone
locked
up
for
life
when
they
don't
understand
why
they're
being
locked
up
for
life?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
there's
an
element
of
retribution
to
imprisonment,
just
as
there
is
to
capital
punishment.
both
deterrence
and
retribution
in
both
instances,
i
would
have
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cruz?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
should
he
have
raised
the
claim
to
avoid
the
second
or
successive
bar?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
wiercioch,
your
rebuttal
time
was
used
up
but
not
primarily
by
you.
if
you
want
to
take
two
minutes
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
if
he,
if
he
firmly
believes
for
whatever
reason
that
he's
innocent,
then
he
can't
be
executed
under
your
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
