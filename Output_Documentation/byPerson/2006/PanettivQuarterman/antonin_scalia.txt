wait.
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
what
the
case
said.
i
thought
that
the
case
held
that
it
wasn't
successive
there
because
the
claim
had,
in
fact,
been
brought
in
the
first
petition,
and
that
first
petition
was
dismissed
as
premature.
and
the
argument
was
made
that
this
is
just
a
continuation
of
that
first
petition.
now,
the
difference
here
is
that
the
claim
was
not
brought
in
the
first
petition,
even
though
it
was
pretty
clear
after
that
case
of
ours
that
you
had
a
sure
route
to
raising
the
claim
if
you
raised
it
prematurely,
and
then
brought
the
petition
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
is
that
in
martinez-villareal,
it
was
plausible
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
second
petition.
now
you
may
be
quite
right,
that
there
is
good
reason
to
say
you
shouldn't
bring
something
that
isn't
ripe.
but
in
that
earlier
case,
we
were
able
to
get
around
the
language
of
the
statute
which
says
a
second
or
successive
petition
is
not
permissible.
here,
how
do
you
get
around
the
language
other
than
to
say
it
shouldn't
be
that
way,
that
you
should
be
able
to
bring
a
second
or
successive
petition
when
you're
raising
an
issue
that
was
not
ripe
at
the
time
of
the
first
petition?
i
mean,
as
a
policy
matter,
that's
a
very
good
argument.
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
the
statute?
and
after
all,
congress
is
entitled
to
say...
to
place
limits
upon
our
ability
to
review
state
court
judgments.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
a
second
run
at
the
same
claim.
it
says
a
second
petition.
even
if
you
bring
new
petitions
in
your
second
claim
that
weren't
raised
in
your
first,
it's
still
a
second
or
successive
petition,
and
i
find
it
hard
to
get
over
that
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
we
get
too
far
into
the
merits--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i,
i'm
not
done
about
the
jurisdiction
yet.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
the
statement
you
made
in
response
to
a
question;
you
said
it's
not
successive
and
it
isn't
a
second
petition
if
the
first
one
could
not
have
been
brought.
right?
if
the
first
one
was
unripe?
but
we've
just
decided
this
term
that
that's
not
the
rule.
in
burden,
we...
we...
we
said
that
even
though
a
first,
an
earlier
petition
was
unripe,
the
second
petition
was
still
a
second
petition.
so
that
can't
be
the
principle
that
you're
espousing,
unless
you
want
us
to
overrule
burton
the
same
term.
justice
antonin
scalia
these...
these
were
not
appointed
by
the
prosecutor;
they
were
appointed
by
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that's
inadequate.
we
have
to
have
a
full
adversarial
trial
of
psychiatric
experts
in
every
case
where
a
prisoner
claims
that
he's
not
mentally
competent
to
be
executed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
and
there's
nothing
in
our
history
that
requires,
that
you
need
a
full
dress
trial
to
decide
this
issue.
and
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
trial
court
to
appoint
experts,
not
selected
by
the
prosecutor
but
selected
by
the
judge,
and
have
them
conduct
the...
the
examination
of
the
individual.
i,
i
certainly
don't
want
to...
you
know...
a
full
dress
trial
on
this
issue
in
every
case.
and
i,
i
don't
know
anything
in
our,
in
our
tradition
of
due
process
that
requires
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you...
you
did
have
your
own
expert,
though?
you
had
one
expert
of
your
own,
right?
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
very
important
matter
is
going
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
opinion
of
one,
one
justice,
what,
30
years
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
other
appeal
to
a
long
tradition
of
how
we
determine
this
matter,
but
just
one
opinion
by
one
justice
because
he
was
the
lowest
common
denominator
on
the
court
at
that
time.
that
seems
to
me
very
peculiar.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
have
incarceration.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
have
incarceration
extending
back
a
thousand
years.
we...
we
had
misdemeanors
and
felonies,
all
of
which
were
punishable
by
death.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
that,
the
section
goes
on
to
make
an
exception
from
the
bar
of
second
or
successive.
the
exception
itself
is
a
situation
in
which
he
could
not
have
raised
it
earlier,
namely
he
can
get
out
of
the
bar
if
he
shows
that
the
claim
relies
on
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law,
which
he
couldn't
have
raised
before,
or
the
factual
predicate
didn't
exist
before,
which
he
couldn't
have
raised
before.
all
of
those
exceptions
would
be
unnecessary
if
we
interpret
the
provision
itself
to
contain
within
it
an
exception
for
anything
that
couldn't
have
been
raised
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
doesn't
require
federal
district
court
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
i
got
that.
so
should
we
treat
this
petition
as
if
it's
one
for
original
habeas
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
rational
understanding
of
what?
that's...
that's
the
problem.
rational
understanding
of
what.
the
state
says
he
has
rational
understanding
of
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
die,
and
the
reason
he
is
going
to
die.
now,
what...
what
beyond
that
do
you
insist
he
have
a
rational
understanding
of?
