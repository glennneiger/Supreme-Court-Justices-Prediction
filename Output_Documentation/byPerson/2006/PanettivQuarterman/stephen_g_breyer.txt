justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
opinion,
then,
how
this
is
supposed
to
work?
a
person
has
been
on
death
row
for
ten
years,
perfectly
sane,
no
problem.
he's
going
to
be
executed
next
month.
tomorrow
he
becomes
catatonic,
absolutely
insane,
no
doubt
about
it,
and
now
it
is
unconstitutional
to
execute
such
a
person.
nobody
denies
that.
all
right,
now
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
you
to
agree
with
me.
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
should
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
your
opinion,
because
i
didn't
memorize
every
page.
i
read
it.
so
what's
your
opinion
how
that
works?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
opinion
is...
and
then
is
that
constitutional,
if
in
fact
congress
passes
a
statute
and
says
there
will
be
no
court
review
of
a
person
who
clearly
the
constitution
forbids
to
execute,
the
state
to
execute
him.
nobody
doubts
that.
nobody
doubts
this
is
an
unconstitutional
execution,
but
there
will
be
no
court
review
of
a
decision
to
the
contrary.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
why
not?
why
not?
because
we
have,
after
all,
a
claim
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
as
a
general
matter
misapplied
the
standard
of
this
court's
cases
as
to
what
counts
as
insanity
for
purposes
of
the
constitution.
now,
you
say
this
blocks
it,
but
it
doesn't
block
a
direct
writ
for
habeas,
so
why
not?
it's
an
important
general
question.
someone
may
be
executed
whom
the
constitution
forbids
to
have
executed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
object
if
we
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
also
the
substantive
part,
that
is,
i
think
there's
also
an
argument
that
the
district
court
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
applied
not
just
justice
powell,
but
marshall's
even
stronger,
and
they
took...
they
say
about
the
same
thing
in
ford,
i
didn't
see
much
of
a
difference,
but
if
there
is,
take
powell.
and
it
seems
to
say,
the
fifth
circuit
following,
that
if
you
can
answer
the
question
yes,
prisoner,
are
you
being
executed?
yes.
what
does
that
mean?
i'll
die.
and
why
are
you?
because
i
committed
a
murder.
that
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
they
say
explicitly,
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
next
thing
the
prisoner
says
and
the
reason
that's
going
to
happen
is
because
of
the
wild
dogs.
you
say,
what
do
you
mean?
the
wild
dogs
are
manipulating
the
minds
of
all
of
the
state
officials,
all
the
witnesses,
because
i'm
a
victim
of
the
wild
dogs
forever.
and
you
have
15
psychiatrists
and
they
absolutely
prove
that's
what
he
thinks,
and
he
thinks
that
this
is
all
about
dogs.
now
should
he
have
that
delusional
system,
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
that
happens
to
be
irrelevant
as
to
whether
he
is
insane
and
can't
be
executed.
now
i
can't
read
powell
and
marshall
as
saying
that,
so
they're
saying
it's
clearly
contrary
to
powell
and
marshall,
that
sounds
like
a
substantive
claim,
and
they
say
correct
the
fifth
circuit
please.
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
you
went
back.
you
see,
you
say
it's
just
justice
powell.
but
marshall
said
for
the
court,
today
we
explicitly
recognize
that
it
has
been,
for
centuries,
is
abhorrent
to
exact
in
penance
the
life
of
one
whose
mental
illness
prevents
him
from
comprehending
the
reasons
for
the
penalty
or
its
implications.
so
that
sounds
like
a
stronger
statement
than
powell.
so
you
add
marshall
to
powell,
and
you
get
a
court.
it
isn't
just
powell.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
i
don't
know
that
that
standard
you
just
enunciated
about
the
rational
one
is
the
right
test.
maybe
the
right
test
is
just
to
repeat
these
words
from
powell
or
some
others.
but
i
think
their
claim
is
whatever
that
is,
the
fifth
circuit's
been
using
the
wrong
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be.
so
maybe
the
thing
to
do
is
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
say
you've
been
using
the
wrong
test,
this
is
the
right
test.
do
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
just
repeating...
see,
what
is
worrying
me
is
that
the
district
court
said
precisely
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
indeed
stronger.
it
says,
"despite
the
fact
that
petitioner's
understanding
of
the
reason
was
impaired
by
delusions.
"
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
that
didn't
matter.
now,
that
means
he
is
applying
the
same
test
in
the
district
court
that
then
the
fifth
circuit
applied.
what
would
you
think
about
our
just
quoting
the
language
from
the
supreme
court
opinions
and
say
this
is
the
language
of
the
test.
we
can't
do
better
than
that.
go
apply
it.
