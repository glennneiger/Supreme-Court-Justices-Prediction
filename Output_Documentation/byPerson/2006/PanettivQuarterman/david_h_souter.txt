justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
position
basically
is
that
"petition"
hear
means
petition
that
could
have
been
brought.
this
couldn't
have
because
up
to
this
point
there
was
nothing
that
was
justiciable;
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
textual
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
ask
you
this
specific
question.
let's
assume
that
the
individual
understands
that
both
the
necessary
and
the
sufficient
condition
for
his
execution
was
his
conviction
of
the
crime.
he
also
believes
that
they
probably
wouldn't
actually
execute
him
except
that
they
are
persecuting
him,
in
this
case
for
his
christian
advocacy.
does
that
person
who
understands
the
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
for
execution,
but
believes
something
else
is
afoot
in
the
motivations
of
those
who
are
going
to
execute
him,
does
that
person
have
a...
what
you
call
a
rational
understanding
such
that
he
may
be
executed?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
more
than...
in
my
hypothetical,
it's
more
than
a
purported
reason.
he
understands
what
the
law
is.
the
law
is
if
you're
convicted
of
this
crime,
that
enough...
is
that...
that
will...
and
sentenced
to
death
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
is
alone
sufficient
and
in
fact
a
required
condition
for
your
execution.
why
can't
that
person,
even
though
he
thinks
some
ulterior
motivation
is
what's
really
driving
the
executioner,
why
can't
that
person
prepare
for
death
just
as
well
as
the...
i
won't
say
just
as
well,
but
why
can
that
person
not
prepare
for
death
just
as
he
would
prepare
for
death
if
he
were
not
suffering
from
the
persecution
delusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
claim
in
this
case
that
he
does
not
understand
that
he
was
convicted
of
committing
a
crime
or
that
he
thinks
he
didn't
commit
a
crime?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
case,
then
every
person
who
believes
he's
innocent
of
the
crime
is
at
least
a
candidate
for
the
rule
that
you're
asking
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
we
can't
predict
that
the
delusion
today
is
the
same
delusion
yesterday?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
taken
a
specific
form
because
the
circumstance
is
different.
he
was
being
tried
yesterday.
he's
going
to
be
executed
today.
but
it's
the
same
delusion,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
ginsburg's
issue
is
a
kind
of
a
proper
issue
even
though
the
event
on
which
he
focuses
has
changed.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
a
silly
fiction.
you're
not
reopening
a
claim.
we
can
use
any
kind
of
language
we
want.
the
fact
is
that
when
he
first
raised
it
he
didn't
have
a
claim
which
bore
a
close
enough
relationship
to
the
time
of
execution.
when
he
was
able
to
raise
the
claim
that
bore
enough
of
a
relationship,
it
was
a
freestanding
claim
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say,
well,
he's
simply
reopening
something
that
he
reopened
before
is
just
playing
with
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
can
deal
with
the
text
of
this.
i
mean,
given
the
fact
that
there's
no
neat
satisfactory
solution
to
this
no
matter
where
we
turn,
the...
at
least
the
text
of
the
statute
can
be
read
to
say
that
second
successive
petition
at
least
means
a
petition
when
it
raises...
refers
to
a
petition
in
which
a
claim
could
previously
have
been
brought.
and
if
we
say,
look,
unripe
claims
can't
be
brought
at
an
earlier
time,
then
it's
not
a
second
and
successive
petition
in
that
sense.
that's
one
way
to
you
know...
admittedly,
it's
interpretive,
but
it's
one
way
to
deal
with
the
text.
it's
kind
of
a...
it
seems
to
me
more
forthright
than
saying,
well,
he's
just
continuing
or
reviving
the
claim
that
he
raised
the
first
time
around.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
do
you
say
to
the
indication
from
those
two
exceptions
that
congress
simply
wasn't
adverting
to
this
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
has.
he
doesn't
have
the
claim
at
that
first
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
in
effect
are
telling
us
that
we've
got
to
read
this
to
mean
that
any
claim
that
he
could
conceivably
have
under
any
set
of
conceivable
circumstances
has
got
to
be
raised
on
the
first
petition
with
these
two
exceptions,
and
that
in
effect
is
a
formula
for
frivolous
pleading
and,
i
mean,
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
know
that
he's
disputing
that.
i
thought
his
dispute
was
there's
got
to
be
some
means
for
us
to
respond
to
what
was
a
new
issue
as
a
result
of
the
reports
of
the
two
court-appointed
experts,
the
issue
of
malingering.
and
i
don't
know
that
he's
saying
it's
got
to
come
in
one
way
or
another
way,
but
there's
got
to
be
a
means
at
least
to
respond
to
that
new
issue.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
cruz,
may
i
just
go
back
to
the
suggestion
that
there
be,
in
effect,
a
remand
to
the
state
court.
if
we
accept
that
proposition,
then
we
are
turning
the
united
states
district
court
in
effect
into
an
appellate
court
reviewing
the
state
judgment
and
the
state
action,
and
that
certainly
is
not
what
habeas
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it's
acting,
it's
acting
in
its
own
right.
some
of
the
factual
record
that
it
must
be
concerned
with
is
determined
by
what
happened
in
the
state
courts;
but
it's
not
reviewing
the
state
court
as
an
appellate
court
would
do.
but
if
it
can
remand
and
say,
you
didn't
do
enough
for
whatever
reason,
it
seems
to
me
it's
exercising
the
equivalent
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
