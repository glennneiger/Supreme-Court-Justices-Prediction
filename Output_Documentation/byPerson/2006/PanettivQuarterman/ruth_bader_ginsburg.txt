if
you
bring
it
earlier,
it
will
be
unripe.
but
it
did,
i
think,
leave
open
the
precise
procedural
posture
that
we're
in
now.
it
didn't
resolve
that.

one
problem
with
a
mental
illness
that
is
a
peculiar
feature
of
this
case,
in
other
cases
something
different
is
introduced
late.
it
wasn't
ripe.
it
wasn't
there
before.
but
here
you
have
an
individual
who
has
a
severe
mental
impairment.
he
had
it
before
he
committed
these
murders.
he's
had
it
when
he
was...
when
there
was
the
original
competency
to
see
if
he
could
stand
trial.
he
had
it
all
along.
it
may
have
manifested
itself
with
different
delusions
at
different
times.
and
yet
at
every
stage
he
says
he's
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
they
hold
he
is
competent
to
stand
trial.
then
he
says,
well,
i'm
competent,
so
i
want
to
represent
myself.
the
judge
says,
yeah,
you're
able
to
represent
yourself,
you're
competent.
every...
this
is
not
anything
new
that
has
happened
to
him.
he
has
been
in
this
delusional
state
all
along.
and
now
to
say
at
this
point
it
counts,
but
at
other
points
it
didn't?
justice

this
would
mean
that
in
every
first
federal
habeas,
no
matter
how
farfetched,
every
single
federal
petitioner
has
to
bring
a
ford
claim.
otherwise
he
won't
have
it
at
the
end
of
the
road.
has
to
burden
the
district
judge
with
this
that
is
frivolous
because
it's
so
far
premature.
but
that's
what
you're
saying,
congress...
the
statute
can
be
read
only
that
way,
to
say
that
the
ford
claim
has
to
be
made
even
when
there's
no
basis
for
it,
even
though
it
couldn't
be
handled
by
the
district
judge.
