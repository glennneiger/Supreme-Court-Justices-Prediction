but
in
the
majority
opinion,
as
opposed
to
the
dissent,
at
least
as
i
read
it,
on
almost
every
page
it
uses
words
like
"local
operator",
"local
enterprise",
"local
proprietor",
"local
business",
doesn't
speak,
as
the
dissent
did,
about
a
municipal
facility.
it
seems
great
care
was
taken
in
the
majority
to
not
characterize
that
transfer
pledge
as
a
municipal
facility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
at
least
as
i
read
the
carbone
opinion,
it
didn't
deal
with
the
public-private
distinction.
it
seemed
to
assume
it
was
a
private
entrepreneur.
and
it
didn't
take
a
position
one
way
or
another
whether
there
would
be
a
distinction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not...
you
know,
you
have
a
whole
string
of
commercial
products,
but
you
have
recognized,
too,
that
garbage
disposal
has
for
long
been
considered
a
municipal
responsibility,
a
municipal
function.
and
you
also
say
that
the
total,
the...
what
is
it...
cradle
to
grave,
if
the
county
took
over
all
of
the
garbage
disposal
business,
the
hauling
from
the
garbage
generator
to
the
plant,
and
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
commerce
problem,
right?
but
if
it
does
something
less,
there
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
halligan,
how
do
you
answer
something
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
says
there's
no
difference
between
this
case
and
carbone
because
these
transfer
stations
are
constructed
and
operated
by
a
private
company?
