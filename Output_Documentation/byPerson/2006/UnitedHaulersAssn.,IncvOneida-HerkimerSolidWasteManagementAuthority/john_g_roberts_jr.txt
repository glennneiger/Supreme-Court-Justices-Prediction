chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
united
haulers
association
versus
oneida-herkimer
solid
waste
management
authority.
mr.
tager.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
don't
even
have
to
get
into
the
theory.
what
happens
in
a
lot
of
municipalities
of
course
is
that
they
decide,
well,
we're
going
to
run
the
waste
treatment
facility
and
we're
going
to
tax
the
people
in
the
municipality
to
support
it
and
the
service
is
going
to
be
free.
now,
is
that
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so,
you
say
formalistic
as
if
it's
a
bad
thing.
but
the,
the
distinction,
say
in
the
first
amendment,
if
the
private
contractor
the
day
before
the
municipality
bought
the
facility
for
a
dollar
had
fired
an
employee
because
of
his
or
her
political
views,
you
wouldn't
argue
that
that
is
state
action
just
because
the
next
day
it
was
going
to
be
controlled
by
the
public
entity.
and
yet
the
next
day,
that
type
of
action
would
be
subject
to
first
amendment
scrutiny.
it
may
be
a
formalistic
distinction
but
in
many
areas
of
the
law
it
makes
all
the
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
kind
of
formalistic
on
the
other
side
because
you,
i
thought
you
agreed
that
if
the
municipality
did
it
through
tax
revenues
and
there
was
no
formal
flow
restriction
and
yet
it
only
made
sense
to
dump
your
waste
at
the
free
facility,
you
seem
to
suggest
that
would
be
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cahill.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
call
it
a
cable
tv
franchise
fee.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
way
municipalities
used
to
make
a
lot
of
money?
they
charged
outrageous
amounts
to
give
the
cable
franchise
and
then
grant
a
monopoly
in
exchange.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
get
back
to
the
public-private
distinction,
what
is
the
answer
to
mr.
tager's
point
that
that's
difficult
to...
what
if
you
have
a
50
percent
publicly
owned,
50
percent
privately
owned
company?
is
that
covered
by
the
commerce
clause
cases
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then,
the
commerce
clause
would
become
the
vehicle
by
which
we
would
develop
federal
law
about
what's
appropriate
for
municipal
governments
to
do
and
what's
not
appropriate?
we
could
decide
it
may
be
appropriate
to
run
waste
facilities
but
not
to
run
milk
pasteurization.
i
don't
know
how
we
would
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
accepted
that
argument,
we
would
treat
the
public
services
just
like
we
treat,
you
know,
the
legislation
favoring
private
companies.
you're
the
one
that's
arguing
for
special
treatment
based
on
public
ownership.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
whole
point
is
these
are
not
unique.
the
whole
point
is
there
are
private
companies
that
provide
these
kinds
of
services.
maybe
water,
maybe
electricity,
maybe
those
are
or
are
not
unique.
but
you
can't
say
that
this
is
a
unique
service
being
provided
by
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cahill.
ms.
halligan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
an
allegation
that
you
charge
above
market
rates
to
pursue
particular
economic
goals
that
the
municipality
has.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
only
facilities
on
your
side
of
the
case
that
are
traditional
municipal
services,
but
then
this
seems
to
be
at
the
borderline.
i
mean,
on
the
other
side,
they
have
the
hamburger
cases
or
the
milk
processing
cases.
how
do
we
decide
whether
this
is
one
of
the
traditional
governmental
services,
the
police,
the
prisons,
whatever,
or
is
it
one
of
these
that
looks
more
like
regular
market
participation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
do
you,
where
do
you
come
out
on
the
50-50
facility?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
earlier
motive
was
not
the
test,
in
response
to
i
think
it
was
justice
alito.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
tager
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finally,
i
have
the
opinion
in
case
05-1345,
united
haulers
association
versus
oneida-herkimer
solid
waste
management
authority.
this
is
a
case
about
garbage.
in
the
1980s
after
serious
environmental
problems
arose
from
existing
methods
of
disposing
of
waste,
oneida
and
herkimer
counties
in
new
york
requested
that
the
state
create
the
oneida-herkimer
solid
waste
management
authority,
a
public
benefit
corporation.
the
authority
would
manage
all
solid
waste
in
the
two
counties.
the
authority
would
charge
tipping
fees
for
trash
disposal.
tipping
fees
are
just
fees
that
dumps
normally
charge
to
people
who
leave
garbage
there
so
called,
because
the
back
of
the
dump
truck
tips
when
they
deposit
the
garbage.
but
if
the
tipping
fees
were
not
enough
to
cover
the
authorities
cost,
the
counties
agreed
to
make
up
the
difference.
to
avoid
this
liability,
the
counties
enacted
so
called
“flow
control”
ordinances
that
require
trash
haulers
to
deliver
all
waste
generated
within
the
counties
to
the
authority’s
facilities.
the
haulers
could
not
send
the
trash
somewhere
else
for
disposal
even
if
that
was
cheaper.
now
petitioners,
the
trade
association
and
individual
trash
haulers
sued,
alleging
that
the
flow
control
ordinance
has
violated
the
commerce
clause
by
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce
and
they
submitted
evidence
that
they
could
dispose
off
solid
waste
at
out
of
state
facilities
for
far
less
than
the
authority
charged.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
haulers
holding
that
nearly
all
flow
control
laws
had
been
categorically
rejected
in
a
1994
decision
of
this
court
called
c
&
a
carbone,
incorporated
versus
clarkstown.
but
the
second
circuit
reversed
finding
that
the
carbone
decision
was
distinguishable.
the
second
circuit’s
decision
conflicted
with
the
recent
ruling
from
the
sixth
circuit,
so
we
granted
review
to
sort
out
the
mess.
the
haulers
argued
that
this
case
is
just
like
our
earlier
decision
in
carbone.
carbone
involved
a
flow
control
ordinance
similar
to
the
one
it
issued
here.
it
required
that
all
solid
waste
within
the
town
be
deposited
at
a
single
private
transfer
facility
upon
the
payment
of
an
above
market
tipping
fee.
we
struck
down
that
ordinance
holding
that
it
violated
the
commerce
clause
because
it
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce
by
benefiting
a
preferred
processing
facility
at
the
expense
of
all
others.
the
only
real
distinction
between
the
laws
it
issued
here
and
the
ones
struck
down
in
carbone
is
that
the
carbone
ordinance
had
benefited
a
private
contractor
whereas
the
oneida-herkimer
ordinance,
favor
a
public
facility
while
treating
all
private
facilities
exactly
the
same.
we
find
that
this
distinction
makes
the
difference.
any
notion
of
discrimination
assumes
a
comparison
of
substantially
similar
entities.
in
carbone
the
distinction
was
between
one
favorite
private
entity
and
other
private
entities
and
we
found
that
that
constituted
illegal
discrimination
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause.
here
however,
the
distinction
is
between
a
government
entity
and
all
private
entities.
government
entities
are
not
the
same
as
private
businesses
and
laws
favoring
local
government
while
treating
all
private
entities
a
like
are
not
discriminatory
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
contrary
approach
of
treating
public
and
private
entities
the
same
under
the
commerce
clause
would
lead
to
unprecedented
and
unbounded
interference
by
the
courts
with
state
and
local
government.
the
county
citizens
could
have
left
the
entire
manner
of
waste
management
services
for
the
private
sector
in
which
case
any
regulation
they
undertook
could
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
but
it
was
also
open
to
them
to
vest
responsibility
for
the
matter
with
their
government
and
to
adopt
flow
control
ordinances
to
support
the
government
effort.
it
is
not
the
job
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
guise
of
interpreting
the
commerce
clause
to
pass
judgment
on
whether
the
voters’
decision
was
or
was
not
a
good
idea,
that’s
up
to
them.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
the
dissent,
joined
by
justices
stevens
and
kennedy.
