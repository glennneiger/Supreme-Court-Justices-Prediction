justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
is
there
a
distinction
between
the
question
justice
breyer
put
to
you,
the
hypothetical
of
a
municipal
electricity
company,
and
this
case?
in
this
case
you
have
private
haulers,
you
have
private
waste
dumps
at
the
end,
you
just
have
a
public,
a
publicly
owned
and
mandated
processing
center
in
the
middle.
it
would
be
as
if
in
the
electric
case
you
have
private
electric
companies
that
generate
the
power,
private
electric
companies
that
distribute
the
power,
but
they
all
have
to
go
through
a
government-owned
transformer
at
the
key.
it
seems
that's
the
case
you
have
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
make
that,
that's
not
the
argument
you
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
least
that's
not
the
way
you
answered
justice
breyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but
then,
but
then
justice
breyer
is
going
to
say
well,
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
you,
that
you
can
bar
it
altogether
but
you
can't
regulate
it
just
a
little
bit--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--actually
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
quite
different
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
authority
for
the
proposition
that
we
use
strict
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
one
case
of
it
being
strict
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
just
didn't
realize
that
that
phrase
entered
into
our
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
to
say,
if
it
discriminates?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
certainly
on
burden
cases
we
don't
require
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
might
be
a
good
revenue
device
for
the
government
to
say,
yeah,
let's
have
our
own
pasteurizing
plant,
we'll
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
anybody
to
use
a
facility
other
than
ours
and
we'll
charge
triple
the
price.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
user
fee
were
ten
times
what
it
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
any
private
entity
can
choose
its
market.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
any
private
entity
can
choose
its
market.
you're
a
market
participant.
you're
saying,
we're
going
to
serve
this
class
of
consumers.
that's
your
privilege.
but
what
you
do
is
you
have
a
market
participation
which
is
sanctioned
by
the
criminal
law.
you've
built
this
trash
utopia
where
everybody
sends
wonderful
trash
and
you
enforce
use
of
that
by
the
criminal
law.
so
you're
engaging
as
a
market
participant,
but
you're
taking
an
extra
advantage
by
using
the
criminal
law
to
enforce,
to
enforce
its
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
basic
commerce
clause
analysis
that
a
state
has
no
interest
in
what
happens
to
the
product
out
of
state.
baldwin
versus
seelig.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
say
we
want...
we're
enacting
this
law
to
affect
what
happens
in
other
states.
that's
just
contrary
to
the
commerce
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
that
was
just
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
stevens
on
your
point
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
who
mandated
this
plan?
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
state
of
new
york
can't
mandate
what
happens
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
say
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
authorized
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
then
of
course
it
can
do
that.
that
has
happened.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
pike
doesn't
apply
to
discrimination.
pike
applies
to
burdens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
you
are
conflating
the
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
do
with
justice
alito's
question?
dean
milk
versus
madison:
all
milk
must
be
processed
whether
been
20
miles
of
where
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--produced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
held
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
could...
under
your
view,
could
your
city
require
all
milk
be
pasteurized
within
your
city
at
a
government
owned,
city
owned
facility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
justice
scalia
says
it
always
does
because
it
benefits
the
locality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have...
by
criminal
laws--
