what
i
guess
we
really
don't
know
is
whether
justice
breyer's
parade
of
horribles
are
cases
in
which
the
municipality
was
able
to
provide
the
service
more
cheaply
if
it
subsidized
it,
in
which
case
there's
no
burden
on
commerce,
or
were
they
accompanied
by
prohibitions
against
competition,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cahill,
you
started
to
tell
us
three
reasons
why
it
was
important
that
you
regulate.
you
gave
us
one.
mention
the
other
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
challenge
here
isn't
gauging
this
business,
the
question
is
whether
you
can
require
everybody
in
the
area
to
go
through
the
one
facility
and
pay
a
tipping
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
sort
of
simple
question.
is
there
an
interstate
impact
on,
of
a
municipal
rule
whether
it
is
milk,
or
garbage,
or
what,
that
says
all
of
this
product
must
be
processed
within
this
city
before
it
can
go
out
of
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
have
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
exactly
what
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
i'm
sorry.
we're
looking
at
the
interstate
aspect
from
the
wrong
point
of
view.
i'm
a
home
owner.
i
have
two
choices.
i
either
send
it
to
the
local
facility
or
i
can
ship
it
over
to
new
jersey.
you're
telling
me
i
can't
ship
it
to
new
jersey.
doesn't
that
burden
an
interstate
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
export
ban.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
case
involves
an
expert
ban.
all
the
trash
has
to
be
processed
in
your
tipping
facility.
