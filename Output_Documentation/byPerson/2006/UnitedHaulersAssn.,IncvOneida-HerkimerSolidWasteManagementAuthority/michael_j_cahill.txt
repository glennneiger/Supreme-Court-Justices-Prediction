mr.
michael
j.
cahill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
decision
of
this
court
has
held
that
public
service
is
comparable
to
private
enterprise
for
purposes
of
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis.
here
the
only
entity
that
benefits
from
these
laws
is
the
government
itself.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
i
think,
your
honor,
they
would
be
different.
in
each
of
those
cases
the
laws
in
question
operated
to
protect
a
private
entity
or
group
of
entities.
in
dean
mills,
for
instance,
it
was
a
group
of
private
milk
pasteurizers
within
a
five-mile
radius
of
the
town...
the
city
of
madison.
in
none
of
those
cases
was
the
government
itself
engaged
in
providing
the
service
to
the
public.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
that
might
be.
in
our
case
that
is
not
the
case
here.
what
we
use
is
a
user
fee.
we
have
a
limit.
there's
a
limit
to
a
user
fee.
we
can--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--we
can
only
charge
something
that's
reasonably
related
to
the
cost
of
what,
of
the
service
that
we
provide.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
in
evansville
airport,
your
honor,
this
court
held
that...
versus
delta
airlines...
that
a
user
fee
is
constitutionally
limited;
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
between
the
cost
of
a
service
and
the
amount
that's
charged.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
your
honor,
if
we--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--in
new
york,
your
honor,
you
either
have
to
call
it
a
user
fee
or
a
tax
or
something
else.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
i
don't
know
what
cable
franchises
base
their,
base
their
amounts
on.
i
do
know
that
in
our
case
the
cost
to
tip
a
ton
of
waste
is
directly
related
to
the
value
of
the
services
that
we
provide
to
the
public.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
your
honor,
i
think
that
the...
they
would
not
be...
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
cases.
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
when
government
is
actually
in
the
transaction,
when
it's
taking
the
risks,
when
it's
spending
public
money,
when
it's
providing
a
service
directly
to
the
people,
it's
a
public,
it's
a
public
service.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
we
don't
have
50
percent
ownership.
we
don't
have
any
private
ownership
anywhere.
there
are,
however,
government
agencies
in
other
contexts
where
there
is
a
private
partner.
that's
a
case
that
isn't
here
today.
but
the
question
was
what
if
there
was,
and
i
don't
think
the
answer
is
automatic
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
rule.
but
i
don't
think
that
we're
engaging
in
commercial
activity
in
this
particular
case.
if
we
were
to
offer
our
services
to
citizens
to
whom
we
do
not
have
a
governmental
responsibility,
then
i
think
we're
entering
into
the
realm
of
competition
with
the
private
sector.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
agree
with
you
that
we're
providing
a
service
here,
and
we
do
use
the
law
to
require
that
haulers
and
generators
participate
in
the
service
that
we...
in
the
system
that
we've
created.
we
need
to
have...
to
achieve
the
goals
that
we're
trying
to
achieve.
we've
asked
our
public
to
separate
their
wastes
and
we've
asked
our
haulers
to
collect
it
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
the
programs
that
we've
established.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
competition
between
our
program
and...
that's
offered
by
the
private
sector.
what
we
do
is
different
than
what
the
private
sector
offers
and
there's
no
place
else
for
it
to
go.
the
haulers
are
required
today
to
comply
with
the
program
and
to
coordinate
their
activities
with
the
separation
done
by
the
residents
and
the
facilities
that
the
authority
has
putting
to.
we
do
things...
we
have
three
different,
three
basic
differences
between
what
we
do
and
what
the
private
sector
would
do.
the
first
one
is
to
step
in
and
take
some
of
the
risk
for
proper
disposal.
when
the
haulers
make
the
decision
about
where
the
garbage
goes,
there's
a
liability
that
attaches
to
the
waste.
if
it
goes
to
the
wrong
place
it's
going
to
follow,
follow
back
both
to
the
hauler
and
to
the
person
who
generated
it.
we
have
had
some
bad
experiences
with
people
making
bad
decisions
about
where
waste
goes
in
the
1980s
and
the
public
asked
us
to
set
something
up
so
that
they
could
trust
who
was
making
the
disposal
decisions.
so
as
a
government
we've
stepped
into
that
problem.
we've
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
generator,
and
we're
trying
to
set
up
a
place--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
i
think
we
do.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
because
we
don't
have
the
power
as
a
local
government
in
new
york
to
talk
to
landfills
in
ohio
or
pennsylvania
about
how
they
should
run
their
facilities.
the
only
way
that
we
can
be
sure
that
it
goes
to
the
right
place,
that's
engineered
the
right
way
and
built
the
right
way
and
run
the
right
way
is
to
offer
to
do
it
ourselves.
and
that's
what
we've--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
think
why
public
ownership
matters
is
that
it's
not
discriminatory.
i
think
the
strict
scrutiny
test
should
not
apply
when
government
owns--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
well,
hamburgers,
your
honor,
if
the
government
was
going
to
be
the
sole
purveyor
of
hamburgers
in
a
community,
i
think
they'd
have
to
have
a
very,
very
good
reason.
if
they
had
such
a
good
reason,
then
yes,
government
could
do
that.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
of--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
am
not,
your
honor.
i
have
no
idea--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--the
concept,
the
concept
that
government
might
be,
might
find
it
necessary
to
get
into
the
hamburger
business.
i
can't--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--that's
one
reason.
it
would
also--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
think
there's
no
commerce
clause
reason.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
i
think
there's
no
commerce
clause
reason.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
the
other
two
are,
your
honor,
that
we
are
fulfilling
national
objectives
in
trying
to
establish
the
system
that
reduces
the
amount
of
waste
that
we
generate
and
recycles
as
much
as
possible.
that's
not
necessarily
something
that
the
private
sector
would
do.
a
landfill
is
not
built
to
discourage
the
amount
of
waste
that
comes
through
it.
our
system
is
designed
to
try
to
change
the
habits
of
our
citizens
and
increase
recycling--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--we
are
not
attempting
to
regulate
what
goes
on
in
other
states.
we
are
attempting--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--we
are
attempting
to
protect
our
own
citizens
by
reducing
the
liabilities
that
they
may
incur
if
that
waste
is
shipped
anywhere
outside
of
the
counties.
we
hope
to
give
them
a
better
solution
for
disposal
than
they
would
get
from
the
marketplace.
to
the
extent
that
liability
crosses
state
lines,
we
are
trying
to
protect
our
citizens
from
that
liability--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--well--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
that
is
the
essence
of
government.
we
are
there
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
stay
there.
whether...
where
a
private
entity
might
decide
to
go
out
of
business
tomorrow,
government
is
going
to
be
there
to
continue
to
do
what
we
set
out
to
do.
but
this
leads
me
also
to
my
third
point,
which
is
that
we're
attempting
to
implement
a
comprehensive
solid
waste
plan.
with
the
passage
of
federal
legislation
on
these
environmental
matters
touching
on
waste
in
the
1970s,
with
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
and
with
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
and
liability
act,
there
was
a
new
message
sent
to
the
country,
which
to
generators
meant,
you
better
think
about
what
you're
doing
with
this
stuff.
you
better
make
a...
you
better
watch
where
it
goes
and
you
better
be
careful
because
liability
could
attach
to
you.
and
rcra
told
government,
states
and
localities,
it
was
their
responsibility
to
come
up
with
plans
to
find
new
ways
to
manage
solid
wastes.
that's
what
we've
done.
any
time
a
government
comes
together
to
put
a
plan
together
to
dispose
of
solid
wastes,
whether
like
ours
it
uses
several
different
technologies
to
try
to
address
different
parts
of
the
waste
stream,
you
have
to
have
the
cooperation
of
the
people
who
collect
the
waste.
if
the
people
who
collect
the
waste
could
drive
its
away
to
anywhere
they
please,
the
plan
is
no
plan;
the
plan
is
just
a
suggestion.
the
haulers--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
no,
your
honor,
it
cannot.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
that
rcra
or
any
of
these
statutes
authorize
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
what
the
federal
statutes
did
do,
however,
was
recognize
that
the
states
do
have
the
sovereign
power
to
act,
and
they
expected
the
states
to
act
in
this
way.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
that
would
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
no,
i
do
think
the
commerce
clause
speaks
to
it,
your
honor,
but
i
just...
our
position
is
it
just
doesn't
require
strict
scrutiny.
i
think
the
pike
test
is
a
very
good
test
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
why
wisconsin
would
want
to
do
such
a
thing,
and
it
would
also
be
a
good
test
to
show
just
what
the
adverse
impact
on
interstate
commerce
was,
and
what
precisely
the
benefits
of,
to
wisconsin
there
might
be.
i
think
the
pike
test--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
don't
know
how
you
would
do
that
either,
your
honor,
but
you
would
be
led
into
that
by
accepting
the
petitioner's
argument
that
public
services
and
private
sector
services
are
comparable
under
the
commerce
clause.
to
go
back
to
your
example,
earlier,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
think
we
are
not,
your
honor.
i
think
public
ownership
and
public
services
are
unique
and
they're
different,
and
they
should
be
subject
to
commerce
clause
scrutiny,
but
not--
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
--i
think
the
approach
that
oneida-herkimer
has
taken
is
in
fact
unique.
it
is
tailored
to
our
local
situation.
it's
not
something
that
the
marketplace
would
provide
if
the
government
was
not
there.
and
if
the
petitioner's
idea
that
any
government
service
could
be
challenged
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
simply
because
there's
a
private
entity
out
there
that
says
they
could
do
the
same
thing
were
accepted,
the
definition
of
discrimination
would
be
changed
from
differential
treatment
of
economic
interests
to
differential
treatment
of
government
or
economic
interests.
and
whether
we
use
the
taxing
power
or
police
power
to
support
a
public
enterprise,
it
would
be
subject
to
challenge.
mr.
michael
j.
cahill
yes.
i
would
like
to
close,
i
think,
because
i'm
running
out
of
time,
with
just
the
admonition
or
requirement
that
we
are,
in
providing
a
public
service,
still
subject
to
the
constitution
and
we
must
deal
with
the
part
private
sector
fairly.
but
if
we
do
deal
with
the
private
sector
fairly
and
we
don't
favor
anyone
in
state
or
anyone
out
of
state,
we
should
be
judged
under
the
balancing
test
of
pike,
so
that
the
court,
if
the
court
below
found
the
benefits
of
our
system
substantially
outweigh
any
incidental
burdens
that
are
placed
on
it
by
commerce,
placed
on
commerce
by
the
system.
thank
you.
