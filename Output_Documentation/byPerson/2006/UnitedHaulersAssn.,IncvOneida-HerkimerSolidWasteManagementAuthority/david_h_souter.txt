h.

but
it
was
also
protectionism...
i
mean,
i
didn't
agree
with
this
at
the
time,
but
i
mean
there,
it...
you
have
to
admit
that
there
was
protectionism
of
the
one
licensee,
the
person
who
constructed
the
plant
and
was
going
to
sell
it
to
the
town
for
a
dollar.
that,
so
far
as
we
know,
that
person
or
that
company
was
in
it
for
the
money.
and
so
for
the
period
of
the
five
years
prior
to
the
transfer
to
the
town
for
the
dollar,
that
particular
entity
was
being
protected
so
it
could
make
money,
and
therefore,
make
it
worthwhile
for
that
company
to
sell
its,
its
real
estate
to
the
town
for
a
dollar.
surely
that
entity
was
being
protected
handsomely.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's...
that's
a
third
case
but
that's
not
the
question
we
have
here,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
sounds
to
me
as
though,
if
we
accept
your
argument
that,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
first
question,
every
municipal
utility
in
the
united
states
is
going
to
fall.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
know,
you
know
that
there
are
plenty
of,
of
communities
that
don't
have
municipal
utilities
and
seem
to
get
natural
gas.
they
seem
to
get
electricity.
the
lights
go
on.
and
therefore
by
parity
of
reasoning
to
what
we
have
just
heard,
there
just
wouldn't
be
the
justification
for,
let's
say,
embargoing
the
importation
of
electricity
and
gas
by
private
entities
from
outside.
so
that
if
you
win
on
this
argument,
no
more
municipal
lifelines.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
more
municipal
pipelines.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they'd
like
to
run
them
as--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
exclusive
monopoly,
and
in
that
sense
they
won't,
they
won't
be
around
anymore
because
the
commerce
clause
will,
will
declare
them
unconstitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
where
does
your
argument
about
formalism
go?
isn't
it
a
formalistic
distinction
whether
the
utility
does
its
financing
through
or
its
collection
through
taxes,
or
through
a
user
fee?
you
said,
you
said
distinctions
on...
i
thought
you
said
distinctions
like
that
were
purely
formalistic--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
therefore
the
distinction
i
suppose
wouldn't
count.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
some,
then
i
guess
you
are
saying
some
formalistic
distinctions,
some
distinctions
that
don't
make
any
difference
economically
but
are
formalistically
different
are
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
same...
exactly
that...
that
avoids
the
problem.
at
exactly
the
same
time,
it's
protecting
the
private
50
percent
interest.
why
isn't
the
better
answer
that
in
fact
that
would
be
subject
to
commerce
clause
analysis
and
that
would
fall,
that
if
the
government
wants
to
do
this
the
government's
going
to
do
it
the
way
the
government's
doing
it
in
your
case,
it's
going
to
be
a
100
percent
government.
if
it
doesn't,
it's
protectionism.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
just
a
question
of
new
york
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
what
municipalities
can
do
in
new
york.
you
say
they've
got
to
have
a
good
reason.
i
assume
you're
referring
to
new
york
law
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
you
referring
to,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
essentially
it's
just
a
political
check
on
it.
when
you
say
there's
got
to
be
a
good
reason,
politically
people
would
get
mad
if
you
didn't
have
a
good
reason;
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
commerce
clause
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
almost
a
fourth
point?
i
realize
you
didn't
get
the
third
point
out
yet.
but
isn't...
i
remember
your
brief
and
isn't
there
sort
of
a
fourth
point?
and
that
is,
i
will
assume
that
the
government
does
have
some
basic
health
and
safety
objectives
and
the
objective
to
protect
its
citizens
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
government
tries
to
pursue
these
policies
solely
by
private
inducement,
trash
haulers
may
say,
we
don't
want
to
deal
on
those
terms,
we
can
haul
somewhere
else,
in
another
county,
another
state,
what-not.
by
taking
on
the
job
itself,
the
government
in
effect
is
guaranteeing
that
to
the
extent
it
can
protect
its
citizens,
induce
respect
for
environmental
policy,
and
so
on,
it
will
do
so
without
any
cessation
of
service?
there's
kind
of
an
assurance
of
service
plus
the
objectives
that
the
government
gets
by
running
the
plant
itself.
and
isn't
that
sort
of
the
nub
of
all
of
your
points?
