all
the
local
processing
cases,
would
they
have
come
other
differently
if
those
facilities...
the
milk
processing
plant,
the
shrimp
processing
plant,
and
so
forth...
had
been
publicly
owned?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
none
of
that...
in
answer
to
my
earlier
question,
i
thought
you
said
none
of
that
really
matters,
right?
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
that
this
is
a
publicly
owned
facility.
you
could
be
selling
hamburgers
or
renting
videos
and
it
would
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
what
it
turns
on,
the
motive?
if
the
motive
were
to
keep
the
jobs
at
the
plant
in
new
york,
rather
than
in
some
facility
outside
of
new
york,
that
would
be,
that
would
make
a
difference?
