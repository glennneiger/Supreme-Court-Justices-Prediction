mr.
evan
mark
tager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
barriers
to
interstate
commerce
imposed
by
the
flow
control
ordinances
in
this
case
are
even
more
severe
than
those
resulting
from
the
ordinance
this
court
struck
down
in
carbone.
as
in
carbone,
no
local
waste
can
leave
the
counties
for
processing.
in
addition,
now
that
respondent's
landfill
is
up
and
running
no
local
waste
can
leave
the
counties
for
disposal
either.
the
issue
here
is
whether
carbone
is
inapplicable
to
this
outright
embargo
merely
because
respondent's
own
the
facilities
to
which
the
haulers
are
required
to
bring
the
waste.
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
concerns
underlying
the
commerce
clause
are
implicated
whether
interstate
commerce
was
being
obstructed
for
the
benefit
of
a
public
enterprise
or
a
private
one.
the
whole
point
of
the
commerce
clause
was
to
promote
the
national
economy
and
to
put
an
end
to
parochial
barriers
to
interstate
trade.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
embargoes,
local
processing
requirements,
and
other
barriers
to
interstate
commerce
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
such
laws
inevitably
prompt
resentment,
retaliation,
and
ultimately--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--the
first
point
of
clarification
on
that
is
the
question...
the
question
is
does
strict
scrutiny
apply.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
yes.
i
am
not,
i
am
not
sure
that
it's
correct
that
in
all
of
those
municipalities
you
hypothesize
that
they
are
actually
pairing
their
provision
of
local--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
if
the
utility
is...
if
the
utility
is
privately
owned--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i
think
that
the
same
logic
would
apply
as
in--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--and
it
would
apply
to
all
of
the
cases
this
court
has
ever
held.
in
every
single
case
involving
an
embargo
or
a
local
processing
requirement
or
a
local
needs
requirement,
if
you
just
substitute
"in
public
ownership"
you'd
have
the
exact
same
case--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i
think
that
the
whole
point
of
the
commerce
clause
was
to
stop
these
kind
of--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
to
stop
the
idea
that
everything
can
be
localized.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
if
they're
only
providing
it
for
free
and
not
barring
you--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--from
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
in
the
event,
for
example,
that
you
found
there
to
be
some
additional
benefit
from
engaging
in
an
interstate
transaction,
i
think
we
would
have...
the
commerce
clause
would
be
implicated.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
they
would
be
able
to
accomplish
much
the
same
thing
because
most
people
would
take
the
free
service.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
it's
market
participation
if
all
they're
doing
is
public
collection
and
bringing
it--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--if
you
parrot
the
flow
control
ordinance
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
yes.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
the
impact
on
the
interstate
market
is
the
same,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--the
court's
commerce
clause--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--but
i
don't
think
i...
let
me
be
clear.
we
don't
need
to
win
that
case
in
order
to
win
this
case,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--this
case
is
almost
on
all
fours
with
carbone.
all
you've
done
is
transfer
the
ownership.
as
you
know,
in
carbone
that
facility
was
destined
to
be
owned
within
less
than
2
years
from
the
time
the
court
issued
its
opinion.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
two
responses
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
there
were
other
references
where
the
opinion
said
"the
town's
facility".
indeed,
the
flow
control
witness
himself
referred
to
it
as
the
town's
facility.
and
the
other
response
is,
to
call
someone
a
proprietor
doesn't
mean
that
they're
private.
in
this
case,
they're
charging
$81...
or
$86
a
ton.
every
ton
that
comes
in,
they
make
more
money.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
affirmatively
decided
the
issue.
i
think
the
distinction
didn't
matter
to
the
majority.
i
think
the
majority
is
focusing
on
the
consequences
of
putting
up
barriers
to
interstate
commerce,
of
putting
up
embargoes
and
local
processing
requirements.
and
you
could
take
almost
any
one
of
the
court's
cases
and
just
substitute
in
public
ownership.
take,
for
example--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
there
were
two
questions
embedded
there.
let
me
see
if
i
can
take
them
in
order.
the
idea
that
it
is
a
traditional
local
function,
i
don't
think
can
support
any
kind
of
meaningful
test
in
this
case.
the
court
has
rejected
that
very...
that
very
standard
in
garcia
and
the
tenth
amendment
cases,
and
prior
to
that
in
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
cases,
and
the
reason
it
did
so
is
it
found
that
it
was
unworkable
to
try
to
determine
what
is
a
traditional
government
function
in
any
particular
case.
the
court
found
that
it
was
in
a
total
line-drawing
morass.
and
so
it
said
we're
throwing
that
out.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
i
don't
know
whether
the
framers
considered
it
but
i
do
know--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--protectionism
wasn't
the
only
thing
that
they
were
concerned
about.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
no.
first
of
all,
what
was
being
protected
was
this
plan.
the
town
had
to
fund
its
transfer
station,
a
transfer
station
that
it
was
going
to
take
possession
of
less
than
two
years
after
this
court
decided
the
case.
so
the
protectionism
that
was
going
on
there
was
really
protection
of
their
investment
in
their
scheme.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
but
it
would
be
equally
protected,
your
honor,
if
the
government
owned
the
facility
but
said
you
keep
all
the
tipping
fees
until
it's
paid
off
and
take
a
nice
profit
on
top,
too.
this
distinction--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
the
case
you
have
here
is
are
you
going
to
adopt
a
new
formalistic
particular
distinction
between
public
and
private
ownership,
when
in
the
past
this
court
has
concluded
that
a
lot
of
these
other
distinctions
were
unworkable.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
i
just
think
you
are
going
to
be
walking
into
so
many
line-drawing
problems
because
if
that
example
is
one,
are
you
going
to
require
100
percent
public
ownership,
or
a
majority
interest,
50-50?
once
you
go
down
this
road,
i
think
it
is
just
opening
up
a
huge
can
of
worms
when
the
focus
ought
to
be
what
is
the
impact
on
interstate
commerce?
what
we
have
here
now
that
the
landfill
is
up
and
running
is
an
absolute
embargo.
no
waste
generated
in
this
town,
in
these
counties,
excuse
me,
can
leave
the
state,
period,
end
of
story.
it
is
no
different,
in
effect,
it
is
no
less
likely
to
breed
resentment
and
retaliation
than--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i'm
glad
you
reminded
me
of
that
point.
i
meant
to
make
it
earlier.
in
west
lynn
creamery
this
court
said
that
these
kind
of
things
make
a
difference.
there
are
certain
ways
you
do
things
and
certain
ways
you
can't
do
things.
if
you
place
an
embargo,
that's
traditionally
been
regarded
as
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
if
you
try
to
do
the
same
thing
by
making
it
free
and
providing
public...
public...
public
collection,
that's
okay.
and...
and
what
the
court
cases
say
is
do
it
the
right
way
and
we'll
worry
about
the
consequences
later.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
several
answers
to
that,
justice
breyer.
one,
the
same
argument
was
made
in
carbone.
it
doesn't
matter
who
owns
the
facility.
two,
this
is
an
argument
about
why
they
might
survive
strict
scrutiny,
it's
not
a...
i
know
you
don't
like
hearing
about
that...
but
the
question
here
is
do
we
apply
strict
scrutiny
or
not.
and
that
goes
to
the
strength
of
their
interest.
and
then
of
course
the
question
turns
on,
can
it
be
met
in
nondiscriminatory
ways?
the
answer
is
"very
well".
since
carbone
was
decided,
the
municipalities
have
been
living
with
no
flow
control,
virtually
every
one
in
the
country,
yet
recycling
has
gone
up
in
the,
in
that
intervening
period.
indeed
the
best
way
to
accomplish
recycling
is
to
charge
volume-based
fees
to,
to
the...
between
the
haulers
and
the,
and
the
generators.
that's
not
what
is
going
on
here.
they're
just
charging
it
at
the
disposal
point.
so
there
are
plenty
of
communities
all...
excuse
me...
plenty
of
communities
all
over
the
country
that
are
charging
what's
known
as
a
batch
fee
where
you
pay
for
each...
you
pay...
you
get
a
label,
like
you
put
on
a
bag;
you
can't
dispose
of
the
bag
without
the
label,
the
label
costs
a
certain
amount
of
money.
none
of
these
people
have
flow...
none
of
these
communities
have
flow
control
but
there's
a
direct
straightforward
way.
they
can
also
impose
regulations
directly
on
the
generators
and
directly
on
the
haulers
to
make
sure
they're
doing
these
things.
so
it
is
hardly
a
reason
for
creating
a
brand-new
public-private
distinction.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well...
i'm
not
an
expert
on...
on
that
industry.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
i
think
they
can
have
the
plant.
they
just...
assuming
that
is--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--they'd
like
to
have
a
monopoly,
and--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
but
that's
excluding
that...
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--yes.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
absolutely.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
yes.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i
think
what
i
was
talking
about,
the
public-private
distinction,
it
is
different
in
kind
from
saying
there
are
certain
kinds
of
conduct,
some
kinds
of
government
conduct
that
are
permissible
like
a
subsidy,
for
example,
take
your
south-central
timber
versus
wunnicke
case.
the
court
said
in
that
opinion
you
can't
impose
contractually
on
the
people
who
buy
the
timber
the
obligation
to
process
it
in
the
state;
but
what
you
can
do
is
you
can
subsidize
it,
so
they
can't
want
to
do
it.
so
this
is
something
that
has--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
one
is
completely
formalistic.
the
court
said
there,
that
gives
people
a
choice.
they
can
still
take
it
out
of
the
state
if
they
want
to,
and
they
may
have
good
reason
to.
going
back
to
the
trash
argument,
the
trash
example,
you
could
provide
it
for
free;
but
a
consumer
might
say,
you
know
what,
i'd
like
to
have
more
days
of
pickup
than
you're
providing
me.
or
i
think
their
trucks
of
this
private
company
are
a
lot
nicer;
i'd
rather
have
a
van
stopping
in
front
of
my
house
than
your
beaten
up
municipal
truck.
so
a
case
like
wunnicke
establishes
that
that's
the
way
it
works.
that
it's
okay
to
have
alternatives.
what
you
can't
have
is
forcing
people
to
do
this
through
regulation.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
yes.
that's
why--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
i
would--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--i
like
your
answer
better,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
what,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
back
to
was--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--he'd
changed
the
hypo.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
you
can--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--i,
i
haven't
seen
a
case
either
way.
it's
my,
my
way
of
seeing
this
case
law
is
that
there's...
that
the
rule
is
simple:
if
you
are
doing
something
to
interfere
with
the
free
flow
of
interstate
commerce,
you're
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
and
maybe
in
that
situation,
maybe
it
survives
strict
scrutiny.
i
don't
know
that
they
would
in
this
day
and
age,
when
getting,
getting
gas
or
other
kinds
of
power
to
a
commercial
establishment,
for
example,
is
not
very
difficult
and
would
not
necessarily
tear
up
the
infrastructure,
or
whatever.
i
think
they
might--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--i
think
it's
hypothetical.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
i
think
his
hypothetical
assumed
a
ban.
but
i
certainly
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
if
they
do
it
simply
by
competing,
then
that's
perfectly
acceptable.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
i
draw
it
from
the
entire
line
of
cases,
from
the
local
processing
cases,
the
embargo
cases,
the
local--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--for?
mr.
evan
mark
tager
well,
i
was
using
it
as
a
synonym
for
the
"virtually
per
se
unconstitutional"
rule.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
if
it
discriminates,
or
some
of
the
earlier
cases
didn't
use
the
term--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--well,
not
the
burden
that
we
talk
about
in
the
price
context.
but
in
the
earlier
cases
they
referred,
cases
like
minnesota
versus
barber
and
some
of
the
other,
earlier
cases,
refer
to
it
as
being
burdens
on
commerce,
but
clearly
what
they
meant
was
there
are
certain
kinds
of
regulations,
and
i
think
it's
easier
to
just
categorize
them,
embargoes,
local
needs
requirements,
local
processing
requirements,
things
likes
that,
which
basically
so
obstruct
interstate
commerce
as
to
require
the
virtual
per
se
rule.
indeed,
pike
itself
has
that
very
statement.
that's
sort
of
the
classic
case
in
which
you
invoke
that
high
level
of
scrutiny.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
review
reeves
versus
stake
which
is
a
market
participant
case.
but
what
is
significant
there...
that's
the
cement
plant
case...
there's
two
significant
things
about
that
case
which
i
think
are
of
interest.
first,
the
court's
footnote
1
is
an
interesting
historical
footnote
about
how
south
dakota
had
elected
to
make
a
lot
of
these
different
industries
state-run
industries,
so
the
hypotheticals
we've
been
discussing
are
not
completely
off
the
wall.
if
you
can
do
it
for
waste
you
can
do
it
for,
in
that
case
coal.
they
wanted
to
do
it
for
stockyards
but
i
think
the
legislature
rejected
the
government's
proposal.
so
the
hypos
are
right
on
point.
secondly,
the
court
made
a
point
there
in
rejecting
the
argument,
the
constitutional
argument
that
the
state
was
not
prohibiting
competing
cement
companies.
and
i
think
the
inference
from
that
is
that
it
had,
there
would
have
been
a
commerce
clause
problem.
second,
mr.
cahill's
user...
user
fee
point.
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
in
addition
to
paying
for
the
recycling
and
everything,
they
were
using
the
user
fee
to
pay
off
the
bond
for
their
failed
energy
recovery
facility.
so,
if
you
start
focusing
on
what
you
use
it
for,
it
is
a
very
slippery
slope.
on
his
point
about
protecting
the
generator
from
liability,
we've
addressed
that
at
great
lengths
in
our
briefs.
but
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
he's
wrong
about
their
ability
to
determine
whether
other
facilities
that
the
haulers
want
to
use
are
safe
for
environmental
purposes.
that's
exactly
what
the
city
of
new
york
does.
because
it
doesn't
have
its
own
disposal
facility,
its
got
very
stringent
requirements
for
where
the
waste
can
be
taken.
fourth,
justice
souter,
i
believe
you
were
raising
an
inquiry
about
the
political
process
and
whether
that's
adequate
to
protect
the
out
of
state
interests.
and
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
the
west
lynn
creamery
decision
where
the
court
said
the
people
whose
oxen
are
being
gored
by
a
tariff
are
the
local
residents
as
well,
but
a
tariff
is
the
prototypical
commerce
clause
violation.
the
political
process
is
simply
not
a
good
answer
to
our
argument.
in
terms
of
your
other
question
about--
mr.
evan
mark
tager
--yes.
mr.
evan
mark
tager
it
would
go
to
a
state.
i
suppose
it
could
be
done
by
a
subdivision,
though.
on
ms.
halligan's
point
about
california
reduction,
i
just
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
that
was
a
case
of
flow
control
to
a
private
company.
so
carbone,
to
the
extent
that
case
was
concerned
at
all
with
the
commerce
clause,
and
it
didn't
say
that
it
was,
it
was
a
taking
case,
i
think,
it
has
been
overruled
to
the
extent
it
had
any
commerce
clause
implications.
finally,
i
would
like
end
with
the
point
that
carbone
has
been
the
law
for
13
years...
may
i
finish?
if
the
respondents
have
a
problem
with
carbone,
congress
can
fix
it.
that's
one
of
the
unique
things
about
the
commerce
clause
that
is
different
from
other
constitutional
provisions.
