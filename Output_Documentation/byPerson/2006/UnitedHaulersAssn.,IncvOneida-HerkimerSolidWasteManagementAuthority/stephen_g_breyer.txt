i
guess
in
many
thousands
of
municipalities
throughout
the
united
states
it's
fairly
common
to
have
a
locally
owned
electricity
distribution
company,
or
an
electrically...
or
a
gas
distribution
company.
and
i
thought
it
was
fairly
common
for
a
municipally
owned
pipeline,
gas
pipeline,
or
electricity
distribution
to
say,
if
you
live
in
our
town
you've
got
to
buy
from
us;
you've
got
to
buy
from
the
local
community.
and
i
guess
that's
been
going
on
for
about
110
years.
and
yet
i've
never
seen
anybody
think
or
write
or
anything
that
that
violated
the
commerce
clause.
but
of
course,
there
could
be
somebody
in
another
state
who'd
like
to
sell
electricity
to
the
people
in
our
town.
they
can't
do
it
because
the
town
says,
we
own
the
company
and
you
got
to
buy
from
us.
now,
if
we
agree
with
you
are
we
saying
that
all
those
gas
companies,
distribution
companies,
et
cetera,
are
behaving
unconstitutionally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
interested
in
tests.
i'm
interested
in
just
the
outcome.
i
just
raise
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
used
to
teach
the
subject
and
i
can't
say
you're
wrong.
but
i
knew
that
it
was
a
fairly
common
thing
to
have
a
certification
that
gave
you
a...
as
a
company,
it
would
give
them
a
local
area
in
which
they
had
an
exclusive
monopoly.
and
that
was
common
and
it
was
called
a
service
area,
and
in
the
local
town,
the
service
area,
i
never
even
heard
of
a
company
trying
to
come
in
and
sell
from
abroad,
because
i
thought
that
this
certificate
gave
them
an
exclusive
right
to
provide
the
local
electricity
service
or
the
natural
gas
service.
i
mean,
it's
a
fairly
obvious
thing.
and
i
might
be
wrong
and
i
mention
that
my
memory...
i've
never
focused
directly
on
it.
just
everybody
i
read
and
everything
i
read,
i
assumed
the
constitutionality
of
this.
but
of
course,
memory
is
fallible,
including
mine.
therefore,
i
raise
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
that
because
i
guess
that
would
be
trying
to
attack
carbone.
far
be
it
from
me.
but
i
know
at
least
there
are
these
things
called
municipal
gas
utilities
and
municipal
electricity
companies;
and
during
the
new
deal
that
was
thought
to
be
quite
a
good
thing,
and
that's
years
ago.
in
all
that
time
when
people
were
attacking
new
deal
agencies,
i've
never
seen
an
attack
based
on
this
ground.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
i
think
it
would.
the
same
logic
would
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
fact
is
there
is
a
difference
between
public
ownership
and
giving
an
exclusive
franchise
to
a
public
company.
and
the
public
ownership
means
that
the
people
of
the
state
have
decided
to
have
their
own
little
nationalized
industry,
which
again
people
don't
like,
many.
but
i
never
knew
there
was
anything
in
the
constitution
that
forbid
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nationalized
industries?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
still
at
least
the
obvious
distinction,
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
to
prevent
protectionism.
protectionism
is
when
a
state
favors
its
own
producers.
and
you
could
see,
indeed
a
big
argument
in
carbone
was,
you
aren't
favoring
your
own
producer;
well,
we
are
at
least
favoring
one.
but
now
where
the
municipality
is
running
it
itself,
no
one
is
favored.
so
i
don't
think
it
was
an
object
of
the
commerce
clause
to
prevent
a
state
from
favoring
its
own
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
is
there
something
here
that
is
not
protection?
because
carbone
was
still
perhaps
viewing
it
most
favorably,
an
extreme
case
of
protection,
only
one
individual
was
protected.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
i
take
it
the
reason
they
want
to
do
this
is
because
they
wanted
their
municipal
facility
to
charge
a
higher
price
for
the
non-recyclable
rubbish
and
that
will
encourage
people
to
segregate
the
rubbish
and
thereby
have
more
cyclable...
recyclable
rubbish,
and
therefore
overall
pay
less.
and
that's
why
they
want
to
do
it,
and
of
course
that's
not
going
to
work.
if
somebody
comes
in
from
out
of
state
and
charges
a
lower
price
for
all
of
the
non-recyclable
rubbish
or
you
know,
for
all
rubbish,
it
just
won't
work.
it
is
rather
like
electricity,
interestingly
enough,
where
municipalities
would
do
the
same
thing.
they
want
discriminatory
rates
in
order
to
push
out
the
possibility
of
poorer
people
getting
electricity.
this
they
want
to
do
the
same
thing
but
they
want
to
do
it
for
rubbish,
for,
to
encourage
recycling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
actually
point
out
that
california,
i
think,
wants
to
own
the
grid
and
privatize
the
rest
of
it.
and
there
are...
i
mean,
it...
justice
kennedy
is
totally
right.
there
are
all
kinds
of
combinations
and
permutations.
there,
there
could
be
distributors
who
are
in
fact
regulated
private
companies
and
local
distributors
who
are
owned
by
the
city,
and
i
guess
there,
there
is
one
generator,
at
least,
company
that's
owned
by
the...
that's
a...
tv...
with
tva.
they,
they
make
their
own.
so
there
are
all
kinds
of
permutations
and
combinations.
and
i
think
we're
getting
at,
when
we
take
that
aspect
of
the
permutation
and
combination
and
say
that
aspect
of
it
which
is
owned
by
a
government
says:
"our
way
or
the
highway".
you
know,
that's
what
they
say.
"buy
from
us".
period.
and
if
you're
in
a
certain
region,
i've
always
thought
they
could
do
that.
and
i
have
to
admit
i
never
really
looked
it
up;
i've
just
never
came
across
a
case
that
says
to
the
contrary.
