justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand.
you
know,
as
far
as
the
impact
on
out
of
state
competitors
are
concerned,
it's
exactly
the
same.
the
state
or
the
municipality
runs
its
own
waste
disposal
facility.
there
is
no
charge
for
dumping
the
waste
there.
the
cost
of
it
is
entirely
covered
by
taxes.
okay.
now,
the
people
you're
representing,
out
of
state
people
who
would
provide
dumping
grounds
for
this
waste,
they
would
charge
9
dollars
a
ton
or
whatever
they
would
charge.
it
would
be
more
than
what
the
municipality
is
charging.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
restraint
on
interstate
commerce,
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sorry.
you
have
to
dump
your
waste
in
the
municipal
garbage
dump.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
that's
fair.
even
if
they
support
it
entirely
by
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
they're
not
competing
in
the
marketplace
in
any
way,
they're
not
getting
any
money
from
the
people
who
are
dumping
garbage.
they
get
money
from
the
whole
tax
base.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
is
indeed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you'd
be
willing
to
go
that
far,
but
you'd
say
that
that
violates
the
commerce
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
they
can
do
it
so
long
as
they
charge
less
than
out
of
state
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore
people
buy
their
services
because
they're
cheaper.
so
long
as
they
don't
prohibit
the
importation,
if
they
run
the
municipal
facility
on
tax
revenues,
and
therefore
charge
very
little
for
the
electricity
or
whatever
they're
providing,
that's
perfectly
okay
for
you.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
they
don't
prohibit
anybody
from
out
of
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
call
it
a
user
fee.
call
it
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
it
a
tax
ripoff.
[laughter]
then
you
can
charge
whatever
you
want,
so
long
as
you
don't
call
it
a
user
fee,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
there's
a
general
agreement
throughout
the
world
nowadays
that
sovereign
immunity,
which
usually
applies
to
governments,
doesn't
apply
when
the
government
is
engaged
in
a
commercial
activity.
now,
why
shouldn't
something
similar
apply
to
government
regulation
which
ends
up
discriminating
against
out
of
state
businesses,
when
the
government
is
engaging
in
a
commercial
activity
it
is
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
commerce
clause?
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
do
that
by
requiring
all
trash
pickup
to
segregate
recyclable
and
non-recyclable,
and
if
it's
going
to
cost
each
householder
just
as
much
trouble
then
there
could
be
competition
and
you
would
have
achieved
your
goal.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
do
that
by
law.
you
could
specify
that
only
certain
waste
facilities
can
be
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
run
the
business
in
order
to
assure
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter?
hamburgers
are
just
as
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
they
want
the
protection
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
whether
a
private
individual
can
come
and
offer
them
the
same
protection
for
less
money
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
the
government
and
we're
here
to
help
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
take
one
of
these
classic
discrimination
cases
involving
milk.
i
think
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
if
wisconsin
adopted
a
law
requiring
all
milk
to
be
pasteurized
at
a
facility
owned
and
operated
by
the
state
of
wisconsin,
that
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and
it
would
really
advantage
wisconsin
dairy
farmers,
wouldn't
it,
and
really
disadvantage
out
of
wisconsin
dairy
farmers,
and
you
think
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
speak
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
government
enters
the
commercial
market,
it
can,
it
can
create
fortress
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
always
benefits
the
state
of
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
so
long
as
it
doesn't
benefit
one
particular
malefactor
of
great
wealth
in
the
state
of
california,
it
is
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
distinction
as
far
as
the
harm
to
the
national
market
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
determinative
element
in
the
pike
test
whatever.
it
is
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
wonderful.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
a
tariff
is
also
imposed
by
a
state,
isn't
it?
as
opposed
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--money
goes
to
a
state.
