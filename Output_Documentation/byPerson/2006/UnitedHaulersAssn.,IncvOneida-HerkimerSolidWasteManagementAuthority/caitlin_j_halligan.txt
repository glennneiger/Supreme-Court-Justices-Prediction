ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
suggested,
justice
breyer,
the
theory
that
petitioners
would
have
the
court
adopt
here
is
in
fact
a
novel
one.
what
they
are
suggesting
is
that
there
is
discrimination
sufficient
to
trigger
near
fatal
scrutiny
every
time
the
government
takes
over,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
private
actors
both
in
state
and
out
of
state,
a
government
service,
that
that
is
sufficient
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
way
that
this
court
has
defined
what
constitutes
discrimination
for
purposes
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
court
has
said,
and
it
has
stressed
repeatedly
in
its
precedent,
that
discrimination
is
the
differential
treatment
of
in
state
and
out
of
state
economic
interests,
not
government
interests,
in
a
way
that
benefits
the
former
and
burdens
the
latter.
that's
from
oregon
waste
system.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
there
may
well
be
an
interstate
impact.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
it
may
well,
and
that
is
something
that
is
appropriately
judged
under
the
pike
standard.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
that
you
do
have
that
here,
and
you
should
judge
it
under
the
pike
valency
test,
not
under
the
near
fatal
scrutiny
that's,
that's--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes,
your
honor.
and
where
you
have--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--respectfully,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
where
you
have
the
government
taking
over
a
service
entirely,
that
doesn't
constitute
discrimination
because
there
is
no
local
private
interest
that
is
advantaged,
and
no
burden
that
is
shifted
to
out
of
state
interest.
that
is
where
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
primarily--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--we're
not
asking
for
a
rule
that
broad,
your
honor.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
where
you
have
a
publicly
owned
operation,
a
government
operation,
and
it
does
not
disproportionately
benefit
in
state
or
local
interests,
as
against
out
of
state
interests...
but
it
always
does.
it
benefits
the
people
of
the
state,
who
make
the
money
from
the
money
from
the,
from
the
very
expensive
hamburgers
that
are
sold
by
the
state
of
california.
if--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--well--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--if
you
were
to
have
government
action,
for
example,
someone
suggested
could
the
government
sell
hamburgers.
i
believe
justice
alito
suggested
that,
and
that
was
to
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
out
of
state
interests,
even
if
it
only
advantaged
one
in
state
interest,
we
would
agree
that
that
would
be
appropriate
for
treatment
under
strict
scrutiny.
but
that's
not
what
you
have
here.
what
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
in
fact
found
here
is
that
the
primary
burden
of
these
local
ordnances
in
fact
is
on
local
residents.
and
so
the
political
process
check
that
this
court
has
found
critical
in
cases
like
minnesota
versus
cloverleaf
and
wunnicke
is
very
much
precedent
here.
this
is
not
an
attractive
proposition
that
these
localities
have
entered
into.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
it's--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
if
that
rule
imposed
no
disproportionate
benefits
on
out
of
state--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it's
different
if
it
benefits--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--this
is
very
different
from
those
kinds
of
export
bans.
those
export
bans
did
one
of
two
things.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
export
bans
that
this
court
has
struck
down
either
created
local--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
does,
and
it
does,
and
to
the
extent
that's
what
you
are
characterizing
as
an
export
ban,
that's
certainly
correct.
what
the
court
has
found
problematic
about
export
bans
are
either
that
they
are
put
in
place
to
create
local
to
correct
economic
opportunities,
for
example
the
timber
cases
or
the
shrimp
cases.
that's
not
what
you
have
here.
there's
no
allegation
that
the
purposes
of
these
statutes
is
to
foster
or
promote
local
industry.
in
fact,
the
only
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
local
haulers
themselves.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
for
a
different
basket
of
services,
your
honor.
a
basket
of
services
that
includes
a
wider
range
of,
of
goals
that
the
private
sector
has
no
interest
in
providing.
to
return,
to
return
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
an
inappropriate
benefit
for
the
citizens,
i
would
argue
that
there
is
a
meaningful
distinction
between
government
taking
an
action
which
benefits
the
citizens
as
a
whole,
which
we
would
hope
any
government
law
would...
any
law
passed
by
a
government
would
do,
as
opposed
to
a
law
that
benefits
a
local
private
economic
interest
and
is
intended
to
do
so.
for
the
dormant
commerce
clause
to
reach
that
far
would
be
unprecedented.
it
would
implicate
not
only
electricity
but
under
petitioner's
theory
it
would
implicate,
i
would
think
for
example
government
decisions
to
provide
prison
and
correctional
services
through
a
public
system
as
opposed
to
a
private
one.
what
about
school
bus
services?
car
insurance--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--two
answers
if
i
can,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
court
has
answered
that
question
with
respect
to
waste
management
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
in
the
california
reduction
case.
it
was
clearly
held
there
the
provision
of
waste
management
services
is
an
essential
function
that
governments
appropriately
provide.
so
that's
been
answered
here.
with
respect
to
this
question
about
hamburgers
and
other
services
that
look
commercial,
i
think
there
are
two
checks
on
those
kinds
of
ordinances.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
very
likely
that
in
most
circumstances
if
you
were
to
say
that
hamburgers
will
be
sold
at
a
government
operated
facility,
that
that
would
disadvantage
local
interests
significantly,
and
there
would
be
a
political
process
check.
secondly
the
court
has
been
clear
that
it
is
not
bound
by
formalistic
distinctions
in
the
commerce
clause
arena
and
so
it
will
look
for
discrimination
that
is
protectionist
in
nature
whether
it
is,
as
the
court
has
said,
forthright
or
ingenious.
so
if
case
were
to
present
itself,
and
the
facts
in
the
facts
in
this
case
no
whiff
of
that
protectionism,
where
you
were
to
believe
that
the
motive
of
a
government
entity
was,
in
fact,
to
favor
some
local
private
interest,
then
strict
scrutiny
might
be
appropriate.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
i
think
this
court
has
held
the
purpose
alone
cannot
cure
an
inappropriate
means
that
is
used.
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
here
you
have
both
a
very
legitimate
purpose,
as
my
co-counsel
outlined
for
you;
you
also
have
appropriate
means.
it
is
not
inappropriate
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
for
the
government
to
step
in
and
take
over
provision
of
a
service.
petitioners
themselves
agree
that,
in
fact,
the
government
could
take
over
waste
management
services
from
soup
to
nuts.
they
suggest
that
there
is
some
difference
of
a
constitutional
magnitude
because
some
aspect
of
that
is
contracted
out
to
the
private
market,
and
would
argue
that
actually
turns
the
dominant
commerce
clause
on
its
head.
one
final
point,
if
i
could
make.
several
of
you
asked
about
whether
or
not
there
are
other
mechanisms
that
the
localities
could
use
to
further
these
goals,
goals
which
are
set
forth
in
both
federal
and
state
laws.
first
of
all,
under
the
pike
test,
there
is
no
least
restrictive
alternative
test.
so
it
is
not
required
that
the
localities
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
other
option
that
might
meet
these
goals.
the
second
circuit
concluded
and
rightly
so
i
think
on
page
20a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
there
was
no
other
option
that
presented
itself
in
the
record
that
the
counties
could
address,
or
could
use
to
address
their
liability
concerns
and
to
encourage
recycling
across
a
very
wide
range
of
products.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
the
appropriate
test
here.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
that
that
distinction
is
essential
here.
it
is
essential
because
of
the
purposes
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
these
are
publicly
owned
facilities.
the
facility
in
carbone
was
privately
owned
and
as
you
suggested,
justice
ginsburg,
the
opinion
is
replete
with
careful
references
to
that.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
that's
a
hard
question,
your
honor.
and
i
think
there
the
kind
of
approach
that
the
court
took
in
a
case
like
westland
creamery
and
hunt
versus
washington
apple
is
helpful.
if
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
motive
is
protectionist
then
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
strict
scrutiny.
whether
that
line
is
50
percent,
55
percent--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
you
should
look
as
you
have...
and
i
see
my
time
is
up.
if
i
may
continue...
you
should
look
as
you
have,
in
all
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
cases
at
the
context
that
is
presented.
so
if
there
is
100--
