chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
lawrence
v.
florida.
ms.
bonner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
presumably,
though,
be
limited
in
some
ways.
for
example,
if
the
application
for
state
post-conviction
relief
raised
arguments
under
state
law,
those
would
not
be
a
proper
subject
of
a
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
other
way
to
read
the
language
is
that
the
state
application
is
final...
otherwise
you
couldn't
file
the
federal
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
petition
may
affect
what
happens
with
your
application
for
state
relief,
but
the
state
application
itself
is
final
and
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
final
before
you
can
file
a
petition
for
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
what
about
the
argument
raised
by
your
friend
that
exhaustion
doesn't
require
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari,
that
the
state
procedures
are
considered
fully
exhausted
upon
the
final
decision
in
the
state
court
and
that
it
makes
sense
to
treat
this,
this
2244,
in
a
parallel
way
with
respect
to
the
exhaustion
requirement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
what
is
pending
with
respect
to
when
the
state
defendant,
movant,
doesn't
file
a
petition
for
certiorari?
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
the
state
post-conviction
application
still
pending
on
the
90th
day?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
anybody
who
wants
the
additional
time...
this
law
was
passed
to
prevent
people
from
delaying.
but
anybody
who
wanted
to
delay
would
then
have
to
file
a
cert
petition,
i
assume?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
filed...
so
you
say
you
get
90
days
whether
you
file
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
want
the
additional
time
that
it
takes
for
an
opposition,
for
waiver
of
response,
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
it,
then
you
have
to
file
a
petition
for
cert?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
what
about
2244(d)(1)(a)
where
congress
referred
expressly
to
the
time
for
seeking
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review?
your
reading
of
d(2)
is
that
that's
what
they
meant
when
they
said
the
state
application
was
pending.
the
state
application
or
the
time
for
seeking
review
of
the
state
application,
and
in...
just
in
just
a
few
sections
above
that
they
expressly
said
that
shouldn't
we
read
pending
in
a
different,
different
direction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
would
have
just
said
during
the
time
of
the
application
for
state
post-conviction,
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
review
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
what
sense
is
it
an
application
for
state
post-conviction
review
when
it's
pending
before
us?
we
are
considering
a
claim
that
the
state
erroneously
decided
a
federal
question--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
it's
not
an
application,
it's
an
application
for
our
review,
not
state
post-conviction
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any,
i
suppose
this,
we
ought
to
know
better,
but
how
long
the
average
disposition
time
is
for
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
from
the
time
of,
i
suppose
the
pertinent
question
would
be
from
the
time
of
final
state,
final
state
judgment,
eventual
filing
for
petition
for
cert,
opposition,
waiver,
our
disposition?
presumably,
probably
five
or
six
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
don't
you
take,
let's
just
if
say
you
take
90
days,
and
you
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
you
get
a
two
month
extension.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
you
get
another
month
for
the
opposition
depending
on
what
circuit
you're
from
for
the
extension.
get
another
month
for
the
opposition,
at
least
two
months,
month
and
a
half,
for
us
to
dispose
of
it.
it
probably
comes
out
to
about
six
months.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
i
guess...
my
question
is,
in
a
law
that
imposed
a
one-year
statute
of
limitation,
is
this
an
implicit
additional,
i
realize
it's
a
question
begging
to
some
extent,
but
implicitly
an
additional
six-month
period
would
strike
me
as
odd.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
reason
that's
tolled
is
because
it's
designed
to
encourage
the
exhaustion
of
the
state
procedures.
this
additional
period
is
when
it's
pending,
not
before
the
state
but
before
a
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any...
any
statistics
on
how
many
petitions
for
cert
from
state
post-conviction
collateral
review
are
granted?
in
other
words,
if
we
are
talking
about
an
additional
six
months
in
every
case,
how
many
of
those
are
actually
granted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
if
the
state
is
petitioning
for
cert
it
means
you've
won.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
presumably
you're
not
looking
forward
to
further--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--assuming
you
make
the
same
argument
you
make
on
questions
2
and
3
about--
the
availability
of
equitable
tolling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
the
court
found
you
were
out
of
time
because
the
state
had
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
have
it
granted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
application
that
is
not
subject
to
review.
we
review
the
state
court
judgment,
not
the
state
application,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
worried
about
winning
in
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kise.
ms.
bonner,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
records
don't
have
to...
typically
are
not
filed
with
the
petition
for
cert.
so
the
record
would
be
back
in
the
lower
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
be
clear,
it
is
your
position
that
to
get...
you
think
everyone's
entitled
to
the
additional
90
days
whether
they
file
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
get
the
additional
time
for
an
opposition
that
would
be
considered
here,
you
have
to
file
the
petition
for
cert.
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
file
after
the
90th
day
it's
no
longer
pending.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
then
why
wouldn't
the
result
of
your
position
be
that
every
person
who
is
denied
state
post-conviction
relief
is
going
to
file
a
cert
position
to
get
the
additional
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
that
lead
to
that
result?
if
congress
was
concerned
that
people
were
stringing
out
the
time
before
they
seek
habeas,
one
way
to
string
it
out
under
your
reading,
but
not
under
the
state's
reading,
would
be
to
file
a
petition
for
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
what's
the
trigger?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
when
they
wanted
to
include
the
90
days,
they
said
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
review.
they
did
not
say
that
in
(d)(2).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
if
the
defendant
had
no
incentive
to
delay,
why
did
congress
think
it
necessary
to
impose
the
statue
of
limitations?
they
did
that
because
they
thought
people
were
stringing
out
their...
and
they
were
applying
for
federal
habeas
after
too
long
of
a
delay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
bonner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
