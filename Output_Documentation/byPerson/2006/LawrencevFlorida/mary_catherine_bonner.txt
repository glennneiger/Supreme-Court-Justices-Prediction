ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
lawrence
in
this
case
made
an
application
for
relief
in
the
state
courts
of
florida,
that
unfortunately
was
denied
to
him,
the
relief
that
he
sought.
consequently,
he
came
here
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
a
certiorari
review
and
the
certiorari,
although
it
was
denied,
he
did
present
to
this
court
an
issue
on
which
it
could
have
acted
had
it
chosen
to
act.
it
is
well
within
the
power
under
28
u.s.c.
2104
for
this
court
to
modify,
vacate,
remand.
in
other
words,
this
court
can
and
could
have
affected
that
judgment.
our
position
is
that
this...
there
is
a
distinction
between
the,
quote,
2104
and
the
original
writ
of
certiorari
which
would
lie
in
this
court
in
some
instances.
when
one
uses
the
appeal,
one
is
not
making
a
new
application.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
utilization
of
the
emphasis
in
2244
should
be
on
application
and
what
was
before
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari
was
the
application,
the
document,
the
issues,
which
had
been
presented
below
in
the
florida
courts
and
this
court
was
sitting
to
determine
whether
it
would--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
and
the
issues
which
were
raised
were
the
same
ones
that
were
raised
in
the
state
court
and
were
of
constitutional
dimension
that
mr.
lawrence
raised
here.
but
our
point
is
if
the
emphasis
is
on
the
application,
then
until
the
finality
of
action
on
the
application--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--no,
sir.
i'm
saying
the
application
under
3850
in
florida
state
trial
courts,
which
then
goes
to
the
florida
state
supreme
court,
is
the
application
upon
which
this
court
would
be
acting.
if
it
were
not
acting
on
that,
what
would
it
be
acting
on?
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
except--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--to
utilize
the
word
"final"
there
would
be...
we
can
use
the
word
"final"
after
a
jury
determination
and
that
in
one
effect,
in
one
sense,
is
final.
and
when
florida
is
done
it's
final
in
some
sense.
but
it's
not
final
under
2104
because
this
court
can
modify
it,
can
remand
it.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
there...
it
is
the--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes.
it
is
the
application
for
state
review
which
comes
before
this
court.
we're
asking
you
to
review
the
lower
court's
rulings
on
the
application.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
sir
that
is--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--that
is
exactly
our
position.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
that
this
application
is
pending.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
in
that
sense
it
is
not
final
in
that
it
can
be
altered
and
that
this
court
can
order--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes,
sir.
it's
the
vagaries
of
the
use
of
the
language--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
that's
exactly
true,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
it
would
require
this
court
to
substitute
the
word
"exhaustion"
for
the
word
"pending"
in
the
statute.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
and
there
is
much
reason
not
to
believe
that
congress
intended
exhaustion
has
a
concept
which
should
be
read
into
this
particular
context
in
which
we're
dealing.
in
point
of
fact,
in
the
1995
proposal
for
habeas
reform
the
word
"exhaustion"
was
in
there.
it
was
taken
out
in
1996.
unfortunately,
the
congressional
history
and
the
speeches
on
the
floor,
etcetera,
are
not
really
illuminating,
except
the
concept
of
exhaustion
apparently
the
legislature,
the
congress,
felt
would
be
subject
to
interpretation
differently
in
different
states.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
i
believe.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
logic
that
this
court
has
used
in
the
context
of
2255's
obtains
as
well,
and
it...
it
is
pending
because
the
reason
that
we
have
90
days...
it's
an
unusual
amount
of
time
that
we
have
to
come
to
ask
this
court
for
relief.
and
i
believe
that
part
of
that
time
and
part
of
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
that
is
that
we
can
contemplate
whether
we
should
be
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor,
that
it
should
be...
this
should
be
construed
the
same
way
that
the
finality
of
a
state
conviction,
the
finality
of
a
federal
conviction,
and
the
finality
of
a
2255
are
determined,
and
that
is
at
the
time
that
either
this
court
has
dealt
with
certiorari
by
denying
or
granting
it
or
that
90
days
has,
has
been--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes,
i
do,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
don't...
that
is
not
my
position,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
90
days
should
obtain
no
matter
what
so
that
we'll
have
a
universal--
rule.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--that
practitioners
will
not
be
making
this
error
because
they
will
be
acting
in
concert--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--that
is
true,
ma'am.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
believe
that
the
way
that
we
have
been
seeing
the
opinions
come
from
this
court
and
from
the
various
courts
around
the
country
are
that
there
seems
to
be
a
favorable
disposition
to
protective
2254,
2255
petitions.
i
agree
with
the
premise
of
your
honor's
question
that
it
would
be
pending
and
it
would
be
pending
here
and
therefore,
you
should
not
go
to
district
court
and
file
a
2254.
now
whether
you
can
and
you
can
do
it
in
a
protective
fashion
is
another
entire
issue
which
isn't
really
raised
here
because
he
did
seek
certiorari
review.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
no.
certainly
i
do
not.
and
the
state
really
did
not
analogize
to
2263
as
i
believe
perhaps
they
should
have
analogized
to
it.
2263
of
course
is
the
opt-in
provision
which
moves
things
along
on
an
even
quicker
track
than
a
one
year,
and
you
have
180
days
to
file,
and
the
congress
was
absolutely
clear
and
this
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
that
the
provisions
at
issue
were
enacted,
that
it
was
180
days
after
final
state
court
affirmance
and
you
had
to,
you
had
to
file.
that's
it.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
think
they
did,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
believe
that
they
did,
number
one
was
to
achieve
their
goal
of
moving
things
faster
if
the
states
were
able
to
guarantee
counsel,
and
the
second
is
that
they
told,
as
well,
in
2263(b)
the
main
difference
between
2263(a)
and
(b)(1)
is
that
the
time
when
you're
getting
your
certiorari
petition
ready
for
this
court
under
the
opt-in
provision
is
not
tolled.
but
the
time
when
this
court
is
considering
the
post-conviction
certiorari
request
is
tolled.
it's
tolled
clearly
by
statute.
i
cannot
presume
and
would
not
presume
that
what
congress
did
was
write
these
in
numerical
order
and
when
it
got
to
2263
come
up
with
a
new
and
exciting
idea,
and
then
not
go
back
to
2254
and
2244
to
change
the
language
there.
i
think
congress
meant
something
different.
and
what
it
meant
was
the
trigger
time,
the
time
that
was
going
to
be
elapsing
between
the
petition,
between
your
final
decision
and
when
you
could
go
to
certiorari.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
the
distinction,
i
have
at
least
two
things
to
say
about
that.
the
distinction
between
the
two
sections,
that
would
be
(d)(1)(a)
and
(d)(2),
one
is
dealing
with
one
thing,
a
judgment
which
has
reached
finality
and
it
is
determining
when
that
judgment
is
final.
they
would
have
had
to
rewrite
the
tolling
provision
because
it
is
not
speaking
about
a
judgment.
it
is
speaking
about
an
application
which
is
a
process.
and
the
second
thing
is
that--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--i
believe
that
congress
is
presumed
to
have
read,
written
its
laws
knowing
the
history
of
interpretation
of
this
court.
and
pending
has
a
very
long
tradition
and
this
court's
role
in
the
state-federal
continuum
obviously
is
of
well
defined
200
plus-year-old
role,
and
the
part
of
that
role
is
that
you
as
this
court
are
the
final
arbiters
and
the
only
true
people
who
can
make
the
decision
about
what
the
federal
constitution
says.
the
state
would
have
you
read
this
as
if
it
says
application
for
state
post-conviction
relief
is
pending
in
the
state
court.
i
would
be
hesitant
to
rewrite
the
statute
since
congress
did
not
invite
me
to
do
so
as
the
state
has
actually
done
by
saying,
pending
in
the,
in
the
state
court.
and
that
is
not
the
concept
that
we
have
lived
with
for
200
years
or
200-plus
years.
pending
means
until
it
is,
cannot
be
any
longer
acted
upon,
and
it
is
clear
here,
you
as
this
court
can
upon
it.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
not
the
judgment
in
the
criminal
case,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
judgment
in
the
22...
i
mean
the
385.1
procedures
in
florida
which
would
be
that
post-conviction
application
because
that's
where
we
are.
we
have
reached
finality
on
the,
after
this
court
has
had,
after
we
have
either
come
to
this
court
for
certiorari
or
the
90
days
is
exhausted.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
am
saying
that
the
application
in
state
court
is
yet
pending
when
it
is
here,
because
that
court
can
be
ordered
by--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--this
court
to
act
upon
it.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
it
is
pending
still
in
state
court
because
this
court
can
order
that
court.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
ma'am.
it
just
is,
also,
i...
there
is
some
case
law
which
speaks
to
the
fact
that
it
remains
pending
or
unsettled
or
unsure
or
unfinal
when
a
court
can
order
another
court
to
act
on
it.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes.
that
is...
that
is
so,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
you
are--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--it
began
as
a
complaint.
this
is,
analytically,
everyone
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
of
pause
because
of
exactly
the
context
of
your,
of
your
comment,
of
your
question.
but
there
is
only
one
lawsuit,
complaint,
whatever
you
wish
to
call
it,
which
we
are
dealing
with,
and
that
is
the
one
that
seeks
post-conviction
relief
in
florida.
if
you're
unsuccessful
there,
you
go
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
that
same
application
is
what
we
come
to
this
court
on.
there
is
nothing
else
out
there.
the
state
seems
to
tell
us,
or
suggest
to
us
that
it's
some
kind
of
an
independent
state...
uh,
federal
action.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
but
it
comes
under
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
versus
its
original
jurisdiction
for
writs
of
certiorari.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes,
sir.
the
state
brings
forward
an
argument
that
this
certiorari
before
this
court
is
not
a
part
of,
not
an
integral
part
of
and
in
fact
not
any
part
of
the
state
process.
i
believe
they
come
to
that
conclusion
because
they
insert
what
they
wish
the
statute
said,
rather
than
what
the
statute
actually
says,
and
we
are
attempting
as
best
we
can
to
interpret
what
congress
did
not,
what
you
wish
it
did.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
believe
it's
like
44
days
if
you
don't--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--it's
not
usually
that
long.
this
court
is
very
efficient
with
that.
and
that's
one
of
the
points--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--you
get
42
or
so.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
yes.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
it
could,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
per
se.
that
may
be
what
looks
good
on
paper
with
the
writing
of
the
statute
and
the
expressing
of
the
statute
to
the
public,
that
one
year
is
what's
going
to
happen.
but
when
one
takes
into
account
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
takes
that
time
out,
we
are
still
not
talking
about
a
365-day
process.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
it's
quite
a
while.
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
know
the
average.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
it's
a
long
time,
your
honor.
and--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
exactly,
till
it's...
that's
why
i
don't
look
at
exactly--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes,
sir.
and
one
of
the
important
things
here
is--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--but
it's
the
state
petition
which
is
pending
for
your
review.
and
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
the
90
days,
when
they
passed
habeas
reform,
they
were
not
speaking
about
30
days,
20
days,
60
days,
90
days
or
even
the
six
months
that
your
honor
posits.
it
was
10
years,
12
years,
14
years.
and
that
was
i
think
the
major
impetus
to
encourage
the
congress
to
put
the
365
day
on
there.
this
court
has
complete
control
over
the
certiorari
process.
you
know,
being
lawyers
we
always
do
file
at
the
last
minute,
but
of
course
it's
this
court's
rules
which
gives
us
the
90
days
versus
another
period
of
time.
it
is,
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
not
like
a
notice
of
appeal,
because
it's
not
just
a
one-page
document
that's
laid
out
in
the
federal
statutes
for
us
to
do.
it's
an
application
to,
it's
an
application
for
review
and
it
is,
it
takes
some
time
to
fashion.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
don't
know
how
many
are
granted,
your
honor,
but
one
thing
that
struck
me
as
i
was
reading
through
these
cases
is
that
many
are
granted
to
the
state.
and
of
course,
when
the
state
goes
to
certiorari
from
post-conviction,
from
a
post-conviction
loss
on
its
side,
then
the
whole
process
is
turned
on
its
head,
and
many,
many
times
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
to
the
state.
and
that
is
another
problem
that
happens
with
this
tolling
if
you
read
pending
the
way
the
state
wants
you
to
read
pending,
because
what
do
we
do
then?
what
do
people
do?
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
it
means
you've
won.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
no.
but
what
happens
to
the
time?
how
do
you
count
that
time
if
you
lose
here?
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i
guess.
and...
you
know,
a
protective...
to
litigants,
protective
and
to
district
court
judges,
i
believe
and
state
court
judges,
protective
petitions
are
kind
of
anathema,
because
since
you
don't
know
what
you're
going
to
raise...
and
in
the
2254
you
have
more
of
an
idea,
certainly,
because
you're
limited
in
many
instances
if
not
all
instances
to
those
things
which
were
exhausted...
but
obviously
there
are
new
claims
that
are
brought
up
because
there
would
not
be
a
stay
and
abey.
there
would
not
even
be
a
request
for
stay
and
abey
if
there
were
things
that
the
federal
courts
find.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--i'd
be
surprised--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--i'd
be
surprised
too,
but
i've
practiced
a
long
time
and
i've
seen
some
very
odd
things
happen
in
courts
and,
both
a
stay
and
abey,
and
the
other
procedures
that
have
been
discussed
by
this
court
have
not
been
handed
down
as
mandates
to
the
lower
court
to
require
the
lower
court
to
rule
in
a
certain
way,
or
to
absolutely
stay,
or
to
entertain
protective
motions
and
then
permit
those
protective
motions
to
be
supplemented
at
a
time
later.
if
your
honors
do
not
mind,
i
will
reserve
some
time.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
thank
you,
sir.
i've
heard
the
state
over
these
many
years
say
that
a
simple
exception
will
help
the
defendant
and
don't
worry,
we
will
not
proceed,
we'll
ask
for...
don't
worry,
we
won't
object.
kind
of
what
we're
getting
here
is,
we
won't
be
objecting
to
a
stay
if
there
is
a
stay
requested.
however,
they
objected
to
the
stay
here
that
the
united
states
district
court
entered.
in
an
exercise
of
honesty,
he
said:
i'm
going
to
wait
for
the
supreme
court
to
decide
what
happens
in
artuz,
whether
they
accept
cert
or
not.
and
they
vigorously.
objected
and
utilized
a
good
little
built
of
time
litigating
it
on
an
interlocutory
type
appeal.
one
of
the
practical
problems
is
if
this
case
is
in
both
courts,
this
one
and
the
united
states
district
court,
where
is
the
record?
is...
it's
just
the
most
practical
of
things.
and
also,
where
is
the
lawyer,
who
is
the
lawyer?
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
so
that
solves
that.
the--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--yes,
i
do.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
absolutely.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
why
is
my
position
that
they
would
not?
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
well,
congress
couldn't
have
been
too
concerned
about
that
90
days
because
it
certainly
permitted
the
trigger
to
have
the
90
days
included
within
it,
and
this
court
has
allowed
the
90
days--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--a,
2242(b)(a).
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
they
did
not
say
that,
but
they
said
while
the
application
is
pending.
and
the
state
did
not
address
for
this
court
what
is
pending
here
if
it's
not
that
application
from
state
court.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
of
course,
of
course.
and
you
know,
frankly,
i
think
all
of
the
defendants
on
death
row--
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
--well
strangely
enough
in
this
case
i
was
looking
at
statistics
as
to
the
average
length
of
time
that
a
case
was
pending
before,
between
conviction
and
the
filing
of
the
2254,
and
mr.
lawrence's
petition
was
filed
within
days
of
what
the
average
was
before
the
aedpa.
that
comes
up
in
a
statistical
analysis
i
believe
by
the
department
of
justice
cited
to
by
the
state.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
oh
yes.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
oh
yes.
when
they
joined
together
in
anti-terrorism,
effective...
the...
just
the
word
effective
was
plenty
to
convey
to
us
what
they
actually
mean.
the
other
big
problem
that's
not
been
addressed
is
these
people
in
a
practical
sense
do
not
have
the
same
lawyer
for
both
proceedings.
many
people
who
were
more
than
willing
to
practice
in
state
court
are
not
willing
to
practice
in
federal
court.
it's
a
more
formalized,
rigorous
endeavor.
and
in
this
case
what
happened
was
mr.
lawrence
had
a
lawyer
who
practiced
in
the
state
and
obviously
must
have
prepared
for
him
that
initial
place
holder,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
2254,
because
it's
typewritten.
they
cite
to
a
westlaw
site.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
that
anyone
can
contemplate
that
that
would
be
mr.
lawrence's
doing
in
his
own
right.
also,
whether
it's
90
days
or
six
months
as
your
honor
has
said,
it's
always
in
the
control
of
this
court.
once
the
90...
this
is
not
a
frolic
of
unnumbered
years.
when
someone
files
a
petition
he
either
files
it
by
the
time
90
days
is
over
or
he
is
out
of
court,
or
he
files
it
and
this
court
is
quickly
reviewing
it
after
some
input
from
the
other
side.
ms.
mary
catherine
bonner
thank
you.
