but
the
chief's
point
is
that
if
a
petition
is
in
fact
found
it
will
end
up
being
more
than
90
days
because
then
you
would
have,
in
addition
to
the
90
days
you'd
have
to
file
the
cert
petition,
the
time
it
takes
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
the
petition,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
tolled
throughout
that
entire
period,
not
just
a
fixed
90
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
does
your
argument
mean
that
a
defendant
who
wanted
to
file
within
the
90
days,
wanted
to
file
in
the
district
court,
wanted
to
file
the
habeas
application
in
the
district
court
within
the
90
days,
couldn't
do
so
because
it
would
be
premature
because
the,
the
state
application
is
still
pending?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
argument
on
brief
was
that
it
is
pending
here
and
the
statute
says
pending.
it
doesn't
say
pending,
as
your
statute,
you
compared
it
with
says.
that
pending,
the
application
is
pending
someplace.
where
is
it
pending?
not
in
the
state
court
anymore.
they
have
reached
their
final
judgment,
but
it's
still
pending
in
your
case
here
because
you
filed
a
petition
for
cert.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
do
you
need
equitable
tolling?
why
can't
you
use,
why
isn't
it
most
sensible
to
use
the
model
when...
for
the
time
clock
on
direct
appeal,
say
there
has
been
a
conviction
affirmed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
when
does
the
time,
when
does
that
judgment...
it's
a
final
judgment
if
you
seek
cert,
right?
but
the
time
clock,
the
one
year
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
after
the
90
days
has
elapsed;
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
way
for
collateral
review
as
it
is
for
direct
review?
direct
review,
everyone
agrees
that
you
get
the
state
final
judgment.
but
then
you
have
90
days
and
nothing
starts
until
that
90
days
is
up
or,
if
cert
is
granted,
until
the
cert
process
is
done.
why
shouldn't
it
be
just
the
same
for
collateral
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
that
means,
that
means
that
if
a
petitioner
who
has
had
his
state
application
for
collateral
relief
denied
wants
to
petition
this
court,
but
doesn't
want
to
lose
out
on
the
possibility
of
seeking
federal
habeas,
that
prisoner
has
to
do
two
things
at
the
same
time:
one,
prepare
a
petition
for
cert;
and
the
other
is
to
prepare,
prepare
a
complaint
to
file
in
a
federal
district
court.
that's
a
lot
to
put
on
a
person,
particularly
the
one
who
isn't
represented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
there
were
31
days,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they'd
have
to
file
a
federal
court
complaint
and
a
cert
petition
within
the
31
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
a
district
judge
who
knows
that
there's
a
cert
petition
pending
just
say:
well,
i'll
wait;
this
petition
will
be
held
pending
the
supreme
court's
disposition
of
cert.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kise,
there
are
two
applications.
your
answer
to
the
petitioner
is
you
have
to
file
in
the
federal
court
within
that
31
days.
if
a
prisoner
says,
i
can't
manage
a
cert
petition
and
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
it's
hard
enough
for
me
to
get
any
assistance,
so
i'll
have
to
pick
one
or
the
other,
isn't
the,
the
reading
of
an
ambiguous
statute
that
you're
proposing
going
to
be
an
incentive
or
a
disincentive
to
filing
both,
which
the
prisoner
has
a
right
to
do?
he
is
going
to
have
to
pick
one
or
the
other
if
he
is
in
this
timeline.
