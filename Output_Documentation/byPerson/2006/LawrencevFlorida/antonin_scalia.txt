justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
application
is
the
application...
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
the
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can't
act
on
it
unless,
unless
it's
final.
we,
we
need
final
action
by
the
state
court,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
it
be
final
action
and
yet
still
be
pending?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
final
as
far
as
the
application
for
state
review
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
the
text
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you're
saying,
though,
is
when
you
have
ambiguous
language,
a
sensible
rule
is
not
a
rule,
it
has
to
have
a
lot
of
exceptions
to
make
sense.
surely
that's
a
sound
principle,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask...
it
seems
very
strange
to
me.
i
can
understand
protective
filings
when
you've
lost,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
protective
filing.
when
you've
won
in
state
court
and
the
government
has
taken
certiorari,
can
you
file,
file
in
federal
district
court?
what
do
you
say?
what
are
you
complaining
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
their
point.
i
don't
see
how
it's
your
point.
how
can
you
cover
yourself?
i
mean,
if
we
come
out
your
way,
how...
how--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
advise
a
client
that
way?
would
you
advise
a
client
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
won
here
and
the
state
is
taking
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court.
don't
worry
about
making
a
protective
filing
in
the
district
court
because,
you
know,
if
by
chance
the
supreme
court
reverses,
equitable
tolling
will
apply.
you
know,
you
roll
the
dice
with
equity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it,
is
it
clear
that
he
can
go
to
district...
i
mean,
i'm
not
familiar
with
how
these
things
work.
is
it
possible
that
when
there
is
an
appeal
or
certiorari
pending
here
there
can
be
proceeding
in
district
court
a
habeas
action
on
the
same,
on
the
same
matter
that
we
are
considering
on
certiorari?
justice
antonin
scalia
district
courts
do
that?
i
mean,
they
would
be
considering
the
same,
the
same
issues
we
are,
i
suppose?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
sure
that
happens,
that
while
cert
is
pending
here
there
is
a
habeas
proceeding
ongoing
in
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
it
sort
of
depends
on
how
often
cert
is
going
to
be
granted,
doesn't
it?
if
you're
a
district
court
and
you
have
hundreds
of
these
habeas
petitions
being
filed,
you
can
either
hold
of
them
whenever
a
cert
petition
is
filed,
one
in
one
thousand
or
whatever
the
number
is,
because
they
might
be
granted.
i
think
you'd
probably
take
your
chances
depending
on
the
petition.
if
it
looks
serious
and
there's
a
petition
pending
you
don't
have
to
proceed.
if
it's
frivolous
perhaps
you
can
proceed.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
be
clear
on
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
earlier
question.
where
there
is
a
reversal
of
the
state
judgment
by,
by
this
court,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
state,
you
don't
argue
that
what
occurs
then
is
equitable
tolling?
but
you
say
that
the
case
is
again
pending
once
it
goes
back
to
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
could
also
say
that
except
in
capital
cases
the
defendant
will
not
have
an
incentive
to
delay.
he
wants
to
get
out,
right?
