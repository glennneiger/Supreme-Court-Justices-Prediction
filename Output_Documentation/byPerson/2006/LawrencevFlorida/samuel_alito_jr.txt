justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
read
the
tolling
provision
in
2263(b)
the
same
way
as
you
read
the
tolling
provision
that's
before
us?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
congress
really
wanted
to
have
two
different,
entirely
different
tolling
concepts
in
these
provisions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
final,
the
judgment
in
the
criminal
case
is
still
pending
because
it
can
be
acted
upon?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying,
are
you
arguing
that
there,
during
this
period,
there
is
an
application
for
state
relief
pending
in
the
state
courts
or
that
there
is
an
application
for
state
relief
pending
in
this
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
it
pending?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
it
pending?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
a
federal
writ,
isn't
it?
it's
an
application
for
a
federal
writ.
it's
not
an
appeal
in
state
criminal...
state
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
your
argument--
