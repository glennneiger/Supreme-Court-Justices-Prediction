mr.
christopher
m.
kise
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
case
amounts
to
no
more
than
a
disagreement
with
aedpa's
recognized
policies
and
procedures,
and
an
improper
attempt
to
convert
ignorance
of
settled
law
into
an
extraordinary
circumstance
warranting
equitable
relief.
aedpa's
plain
language
and
recognized
purpose
is
established,
that
tolling
does
not
extend
to
the
post-conviction
certiorari
process.
additionally,
ignorance
of
settled
law
whether
by
an
incarcerated
pro
se
petitioner,
by
private
counsel,
or
by
appointed
counsel
is
not
an
extraordinary
circumstance
and
does
not
excuse
prompt
filing.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
no,
your
honor.
and
i'm
assuming
your
question
is
asking
me,
grant
certiorari
based
on
an
application
filed
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
in
both
circumstances
the
answer
would
be
no,
and
in
both
circumstances
i
think
the
relief
that
would
be
accorded--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--it
may
be
pending
in
state
court
during
the
further
proceedings,
but
it's
not
pending
during
the
time
that
it
is
at
this
court,
because
this
court
has
not--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--based
on
equitable
principles,
i
think
that
would
be
the
interpretation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
you're
using
the
phraseology
interruption,
and
i
would,
would--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--in
that
unusual
circumstance,
your
honor,
i
think
principles
of
equitable
tolling
would
apply
to
keep
the
petitioner's
ability
to
file.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
statutory
pending
contemplates
a
finality,
it
contemplates...
and
i
think
that
this
is,
it
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems,
i
believe,
with
petitioner's
construction,
is
this
ignoring
of
not
only
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
but
what
this
court
has
said
about
this
statute,
about
2244(d)(2).
in
duncan
this
court
said
that
state,
the
word
state
modifies
both
post-conviction
and
other
collateral
review,
and
established
that
we
are
talking
about
a
state
application.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is,
and
i
believe
that's
what
this
court
said--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
would
be,
that's
inconsistent
with
the
language
utilized
by
this
court
in
carey
where
the
court
defined
pending
as
until
final
resolution
through
the
state's
post-conviction--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--correct,
your
honor,
but
the
language
utilized
nevertheless--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--fair
enough,
your
honor.
then
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
that
it
cannot
be
both
final
for
1257
purposes
and
pending--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
would,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
with
that
nondistinction,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
application--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--because
i
would,
i
would
disagree
with
the
notion
that
further
proceedings
could
be
had
on
that
application.
the
basis
for
this
court's
certiorari
of
jurisdiction
is
that
it
is
subject
to
no
further
review
or
correction
in
any
state.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
state
application
may
be
the
subject
matter
of
what
you
are
looking
at
from
a
subject
matter
standpoint,
but
what
the
court
is
ruling
on
is
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
a
federal
court
ruling
on--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--and
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
final
for
1257
purposes
and
still
pending
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
application
is
the
state
court.
i
mean,
the
judgment
is
what
is
being
reviewed,
and
it
is
a
final
judgment
in
the
application.
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
no
power
at
all
once
they
have
issued
the
mandate
to
go
back
and
modify,
to
correct
it
six
months
later.
if
the
florida
supreme
court
decided,
you
know,
we
made
a
mistake
in
that
application,
they
don't
have
the
power
sua
sponte
to
correct
it.
it
is
final.
it
is
over.
the
state's
province
has
been
completed.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
in
that
circumstance,
yes,
your
honor,
certainly
they
would
in
a
circumstance,
in
the
very
unusual
circumstance
where
this
court
were
to
accept
certiorari
and
then
subsequent
to
the
acceptance
of
certiorari,
then
reverse
the
ruling.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
is,
again,
the
extraordinary
circumstance.
and
that
i
think
points
out
the,
one
of
the
flaws
in
petitioner's
argument,
and
that
is
that
that's
making
the
exception
the
rule,
that
clearly
congress
did
not
intend
to
add
what
i
believe
chief
justice
roberts
alluded
to
earlier,
an
extra
three
months,
an
extra
six
months.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
would
be
a
lot
of
exceptions.
i
think
this
would
be,
the
only
exception
would
be,
to
the
rule
that
we
are
advocating
would
be
in
the
unusual
circumstance,
the
one
in
5,000
cases,
the
one
in
1,000
cases,
the
exceptional
case
where
this
court
actually
grants
certiorari,
those
cases
are
exceptional
in
and
of
themselves.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
thank
you,
justice
breyer,
and
i
would
respectfully
answer
your
question
i
think
in
three
ways.
first,
drawing
a
distinction
between
when
the
state
petitions
for
certiorari
and
when
the
habeas
petitioner
petitions
for
certiorari.
under
both
circumstances,
equitable
principles
would
apply,
but
they
would
apply
in
i
think
different
ways.
but
in
either
circumstance,
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
subsequently
seek
habeas
review
would
be
protected.
and
so
what
we
are
advocating
is
not
making
those
exceptional
cases
the
rule.
in
a
case
where
the
state
petitions
for
certiorari
there
isn't
an
ability,
there
is
no
way
to
even
file
a
protective
habeas
because
there
is
nothing
to
file.
you've
won,
the
habeas
petitioner
has
won
in
the
court
below.
there
is
no
cause
of
action.
there
isn't
a
basis
upon
which
to
file
a
federal
habeas
claim,
so
even
a
protective
one
would
be,
it
wouldn't
be
premature,
it
would
be
effectively
nonexistent.
so
from
an
equitable
standpoint,
the
extraordinary
circumstance
which
the
courts
have
recognized,
the
circuits
have
recognized
that
the
test
for
equitable
circumstance
is,
the
extraordinary
circumstance
would
be
this
court
accepting
certiorari.
and
then
the
exercise
of
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
is
if
the
petitioner
did
everything
he
or
she
could
under
that
circumstance,
because
there
would
be
no
way
for
that
petitioner
to
file
for
a
federal
habeas
review
because
there
would
be
no
basis
for
it.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
you
cannot.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
there
isn't
a
need
to
cover
us
up,
your
honor,
because
you've
won
in
state
court.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
in
the
one
in
1,000
or
one
in
5,000
cases,
equitable
principles
would
then
apply.
the
distinction
may
not
be
clear
between
statutory
tolling,
what
the
statute
actually
provides
for,
and
equitable
tolling,
equitable
principles
that
have
been
applied
by
the
court.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
don't
think
there
would
be...
i
think
it
would
be
ill
advised
to,
to
direct
a
petitioner
to
file
in
federal
court
under
those
circumstances
because
there
would
be
nothing
to
file.
what
would
be
the
complaint?
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
there
would
be
absolutely
nothing
to
file.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
it
has
its
harshest
consequences,
because
that's
where
the
equitable
tolling
principles
would
in
fact
apply.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
would
say
it's
different,
your
honor,
respectfully,
for
two
reasons:
one,
because
this
court
has
said
that
direct
review
is
different
in
numerous
cases.
and
two,
because
the
statute
makes
that
distinction.
congress
in
(d)(1)(a)
utilized
that
very
specific
language
that
included
the,
the
certiorari
period
and
in
(d)(2)
did
not
use
that
language,
and
it
is
the
absence
of
that
language
that
indicates
that
tolling
is
only
to
apply
while
a
petitioner
is
exhausting
relief,
state
relief.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
in
many
circumstances
that
would
be
the
case,
but
not
always
the
case.
it
depends
on
how
much
time
is
left
on
the
federal
statute
of
limitations,
how
much
time
is
remaining,
how
long
did
it
take
to
get
through
the
state
post-conviction
process.
how
timely
was
the
filing
in
the
state
post
conviction
process.
and
how
much
time
is
remaining,
assuming
for
what
was
discussed--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--then
they
would
need
to
file...
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
would
need
to--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
amount
of
time
that
would
elapse
before
this
court
were
to
rule
on
the
cert
petition
would
consume
that
31
days.
and
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
what
congress
intended
here
because
what
congress
intended
by
this
provision
was
to
provide
petitioner...
well,
what
this
court
said
in
duncan,
what
this
court
has
recognized,
is
that
the
scheme
that
has
been
put
together
here
by
congress
is
one
which
encourages
petitioners
first
to
file
and
exhaust
their
state
remedies,
recognizing
and
giving
deference
to
the
principles
of
comity,
and
then
second
to
file,
once
they're
done
with
their
state
process,
once
they've
completed
the
state
process
and
exhausted
their
state
remedies,
to
file
their
federal
habeas,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
duncan,
"as
soon
as
possible".
and
the
anomaly
that
would
be
created
by
petitioner's
construction
would
be
it
would
be
the
only
time
under
all
of
aedpa
where
a
petitioner
could
file
in
federal
district
court
but
isn't
required
to
file.
and
so
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
it
cannot
be
both
exhausted
and
pending
at
the
same
time.
it
would
not
fit
within
the
scheme
that
this
court
has
already
determined
the
structure
of
(d)(2)
is
designed
to
accomplish.
the
principle
is
that
you
are
to,
as
a
habeas
petitioner,
go
quickly
to
state
court,
and
we're
going
to
give
state
courts
the
first
opportunity
at
these
federal
constitutional
questions.
and
yes,
justice
stevens,
it
may
take
some
time.
it
may
take
several
years
in
federal...
in
state
court,
before
they
accomplish
that
purpose.
but
that's
the
state's
issue
because
it's
the
state's
judgment
and
the
state
is
taking
its
time
and
it
shouldn't
be...
and
this
is
what
congress
recognized
i
think
in
(d)(2)...
that,
that,
that
the
petitioner
should
not
be
penalized
for
that
time.
that's
why
it
was
tolled.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
can.
i
believe,
there
is,
in
fact--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
i
don't
know
that
they
would
be
considering
the
exact
same
issues,
your
honor.
and
there
are
many
things
that
can
be
done...
petitioner--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
i
certainly
hope
that
in
the
10
of
the
11
circuits
that
have
agreed
with
florida's
position
here
that
that
is
happening,
because
if
not
then
they
are
at
risk,
depending
on
how--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
would
respectfully
say
to
your
honor
that
it's
not
an
automatic
stay.
i
mean,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
stay
at
some
point.
but
there
are
things
that
can
be
accomplished
in
federal
court
before
the
undertaking
of
the
review.
there
is
the
rule
4
screening
process
in
habeas.
there
is
the
initial
review
by
the
district
court
to
see
if
the
filing
itself
meets
the
procedural
requirements.
there
is
the
asking
for
an
answer
by
the
state.
there
is
discovery
that
can
take
place.
all
of
this
can
take
place
while
the
cert
petition
is
pending
before
the
federal
district
undertakes
any
review
of
the
merits.
now,
if
there
gets
to
be
this
juxtaposition
where
it
looks
like
there
is
going
to
be
a
conflict
between
the
federal
district's
court's
review
of
the
substantive
merits
and
that
is
going
to
conflict
with
this
court's
certiorari
review,
well,
then
i
think
a
stay
would
be
implemented.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
they
may
not
have
to--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
really
the
point,
and
you've
obviously
articulated
it
better
than
i
did
in
my
previous
answer.
but
that's
exactly
right,
that--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
it
may
be
that
long.
it
may
be
a
shorter
period.
but
i
think
what
we
need
to
look
at
is
not
what
we
would
think
would
be
the
preferred
time
frame,
but
what
congress
said
was
the
preferred
time
frame.
and
congress
is
saying
that
it's
one
year,
and
the
only
time
it's
tolled
is
when
the
petitioner
is
doing
what
it
should
be
doing
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
that's
again
what
this
court
said
in
duncan
about
describing
this
entire
structure.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
think
it's
partly
fair,
your
honor.
what
i
would
say
is
the
time...
certain
time
is
consumed
just
determining
whether
or
not
under
the
rule
4
screening
process,
whether
or
not
the
petition
meets
the
formal
requirements,
whether
they've
articulated
the
claim
in
the
correct
way
and
whether
it's
worthy
of
the
state
response,
if
there's
discovery
that
needs
to
be
had.
i
mean,
all
of
these
things
can
be
taking
place
and
in
the
one
in
one
thousand
or
perhaps
more
than
that...
and
i
don't
pretend
to
have
the
exact
number
or
the
statistics...
but
in
the
very,
very
usual
circumstance
where
cert
is
actually
granted,
i
think
then
a
stay
could
be
put
in
place.
and
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say,
respectfully,
that
congress
intended
to
forestall
this
entire
process
while
this
court
undertakes
certiorari
review.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
respectfully,
your
honor...
and
i
know
that
that
is
the
petitioner's
argument
and
i
see
that
you
have
given
me
that
question,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
is
that
much
of
a
choice.
i
mean,
i
think
that
they
can
file,
they
can
file
both
in
those
circumstances
and,
and
depending
on
the
particular
circumstances...
and
this
is
back
to
the
equitable
tolling
principles...
for
statutory
tolling
purposes,
i
think
the
answer
is
they
must
file
both
or
they
forfeit
the
right
to
one
or
the
other.
if
they
choose
not
to
file
for
cert,
then
they
voluntarily
if
they
pass
the
90
days
forfeited
that
right;
and
if
they
don't
file
within
the
statutory
period
then
they
have
under
aedpa
missed
the
statute
of
limitations
deadline.
but
i
would,
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
possible
to
do
both,
and
in
circumstances
where
there
is
some
impediment
to
them
doing
just
that,
if
they
exercise
diligence,
if
they
are
doing
everything
they
possibly
can
and
it
is
not
possible
to
file
both
at
the
same
time,
well,
then
i
think
under
the
facts
of
the
proper
scenario
that
equitable
principles
might
apply.
but
again,
to
say
that
congress
built
into
the
system
this
automatic
time
period
that's
going
to
be
tacked
on
to
a
very
short
one-year
statute
of
limitations,
a
statute
of
limitations
that
is
designed
to
really
move
things
through
the
system
rapidly,
is,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
language,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
consistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
duncan
or,
with
respect
to
justice
breyer,
what
this
court
said
in
carey.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
think
once
it's
back
in
the
state
system
then
it
would
have
to
be
considered
pending,
because
the
statute
contemplates
that
while
it's
part
of
the
state
process
it
would
be
pending.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
