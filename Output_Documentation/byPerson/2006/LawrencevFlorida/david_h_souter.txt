justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
same
sense
that
it
is
pending
after
the
trial
court
has
acted
but
before
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
decides
whether
he
wants
a
state
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
where
it's
pending.
whether
it's
still
pending
in
the
state
trial
court
or
in
the
state
appeals
court.
but
nobody
denies
that
it's
pending.
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
be,
whatever
mending
means
there,
pending
means
here
because
there
is
no
modifier
that
would
limit
the
same...
the
same
construction.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
succeed
you're
going
to
get
an
order
from
this
court
to
the
state
court
say,
saying,
go
back
in
this
state
proceeding
that
has
been
begun,
and
do
it
right.
so
the
focus
of
it
is
still
the
state
proceeding
even
though
we
may
correct
it
under
appellate
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
say
state
pending
or
pending
in
state
court,
and
what
i
want
to
do
is
go
back
and
ask
a
question
somewhat
along
the
lines
that
justice
stevens
asked.
is
the
application
pending
in
the
period
between
the
disposition
of
the
petition
by
the
state
trial
court
and
the
determination
by
the
petitioner
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
for
state
appellate
relief?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
the
same
token,
why
isn't
it
pending
between
the
final
disposition
by
the
state
appellate
court
and
the
determination
to
seek
cert
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
isn't
your
sister's
answer
to
that
adequate?
it
is
the
state
judgment
that
is
final,
but
action
on
the
petition
is
not
yet
final
until
it
has
gone
through
the
period
allowed
for
final
review
by
this
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
distinguishing
between
a
state
judgment
and
an
application
upon
which
further,
further
proceedings
can
be
had.
why
is
that
a
nondistinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
the,
the
petition
for
cert
is
granted
and
this
court
grants
relief.
the
relief
as
i
understand
it
is
going
to
consist
of
a
remand
to
the
state
court
saying
you
did
something
wrong
on
this
application
before,
go
back
and
do
it
over
again
and
do
it
right.
it's
the...
it
is
the
state
application
which
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
it
and
that
therefore,
it
is
the
state
application
that
necessarily
is
the
subject
of
the
cert
petition.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
action
taken
on
a
state
petition,
just
as
at
the
state
level,
whatever
may
be
the,
the
nomenclature
for
filing
an
appeal
from
the
state
trial
court
to
the
state
appellate
court,
is
an
application
which
relates
entirely
to
the
original
application
for
relief
that
was
filed
in
the
state
trial
court.
it
seems
to
me
the
two
situations
are
exactly
parallel.
