justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
you're
talking
about
language,
if
i
followed
it,
in
2244(d)(2).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
tolled
the
statute
while
the
"properly
filed
application
for
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review
is
pending.
"
so
the
question
is
during
the
90
days
after
they
said
no
to
you
in
the
state
court
and
you
had
a
chance
to
file
the
writ,
is
that
application
pending?
and
you
say
yes,
that
application
is
pending,
that
application
is
pending
and
subject
to
various
motions,
such
as
a
motion
or
a
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
is
pending.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
we
are
in
this
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
that?
i
would
have
thought
it
said
that
there
has
to
be
a
final
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
and
the
final
judgment
of
the
state
court
concerns
that
application
which
is
still
pending
and
will
continue
to
be
pending
at
least
for
90
days
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
doesn't
require
a
final
state
application.
it
requires
a
final
judgment
about
the
state
application.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
the
issue
in
that
case.
this
issue
wasn't
in
that
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
when
i
write
something,
i
don't
think
i
or
anyone
else
can,
if
it
happens
to
be
a
state
case,
refrain
from
using
the
word
state.
i
wouldn't
say
there
is
an
implication
in
writing
an
opinion
that
it
doesn't
mean
federal
as
well.
as
least
i
can't
find
that
written
in
the
opinion
anywhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
the
most
likely
where
people
are
going
to
get
mixed
up.
i
mean,
i'm
not
following...
i
think
i
think
this
argument
about
the
word
is
metaphysical,
you
know,
and
i
can
make
wonderful
arguments,
and
you
have
made
wonderful
arguments
on
both
sides
of
this.
i
just
can't
get
a
clear
answer.
so
if
i
were
right
about
that
and
there
is
no
clear
answer
from
the
language,
then
the
thing,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
puts
my
greatest
concern,
my
greatest
concerns
are
practical.
if
we
take
your
position,
we
have
words
right
next
to
each
other,
near
each
other
in
the
same
statutory
provision,
meaning
different
things.
and
i've
learned
out
of
my
own
experience
perhaps,
judges
and
lawyers
are
not
always
geniuses
and
they
get
mixed
up.
and
they
will
get
mixed
up
all
the
time,
and
when
they
get
mixed
up,
people
will
lose
rights
that
they
have.
the
second
concern
of
justice
stevens,
which
is
what
happens
in
the
case,
and
those
are
the
ones
who
intuitively
are
going
to
cause
the
problem.
because
on
a
rare
occasion,
the
state
or
the
prisoner
has
a
very
good
supreme
court
case.
and
that's
going
to
be
the
case
where
he
forgets
to
file
in
the
federal
court
because
he
thinks
this
thing
isn't
over,
and
lo
and
behold,
the
court
grants
it.
and
now
what
happens?
on
your
interpretation,
i
just
see
a
mess,
and
on
the
other
interpretation,
it
seems
to
work
out
fine.
so
those,
i
would
say
are
the
two
practical
problems,
and
anything
you
would
like
to
say
about
that,
i'd
like
to
listen
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
if
you're
formally
right
on
the
metaphysical
question.
but
if
you're
not,
now
thinking
you
just
gave
a
response
to
the
chief
justice
that
said,
well,
really
the
federal
district
judge
when
he
gets
these
things
just
has
to
look
at
them
and
then
he
figures
out
whether
he
is
going
to
stay
it
or
whether
he's
going
to
proceed
on
some
issues
or
whether
he
is
going
to
do
something
else.
and
that's
what
you
thought
was
fairly
easy.
you
have
the
experience
there
and
i
just
wonder
how
easy
it
is.
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
it
be
easy?
because
i
guess
before
doing
anything
the
judge
has
to
know
what
this
thing
is
about.
and
that's
where
it
seems
to
me
to
take
the
time
of
a
district
judge.
they
have
many,
many
petitions.
sometimes
they
are
well
organized,
sometimes
not.
he
sends
them
to
a
magistrate
possibly.
the
magistrate
has
a
lot
to
do,
and
the
time
consumed
is
the
time
finding
out
what
is
this
case
about.
is
that
fair
characterization
or
not?
how
easy
is
it?
