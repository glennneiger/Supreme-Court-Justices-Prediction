justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
on
that,
ms.
bonner,
what
typically
in
florida
is
the
time
elapsed
between
the
conclusion
of
the
criminal
proceeding
and
the
conclusion
of
the
state
collateral
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
more
than
six
months,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
two,
three,
four,
five
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
all
that
time,
the
statute
has
been
tolled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
there
may
be
another
six
months
added
on
to
that
five
or
six-year
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kise,
can
i
ask
you
what
your
view
in
this
matter
would
be
if
the
court
grants
certiorari,
would
the
application
be
pending
during
the
period
that
the
case
is
under
advisement
in
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
a
second
question.
suppose
it
were
reversed,
we
send
it
back
for
further
proceedings
in
the
state
trial
court,
would
you
say
that
it's
still
not
pending
during
the
further
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
started
pending
again
after
an
interruption,
is
that
the
way
it
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forget
about
equitable
principles,
statutory
principles.
is
there
a
lack
of
continuity,
where
you
could
have
it
pending
for
a
period
of
a
couple
years
and
then
an
interruption,
and
then
it
can
resume
pending
after
the
interruption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
period
when
it's
not
pending
followed
by
a
period
when
it
begins
to
pend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
would
be
no
statutory
right
in
your
view,
it
would
depend
on
the
equitable
considerations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
would
correct
it
if
we
told
them
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
it
got
back
in
the
state
supreme
court,
they
would
still
be
working
on
the
application
that
had
been
pending
until
the
end
of
the
proceedings
down
there,
and
then
suddenly
came
back
to
life
after
we
sent
it
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
irony
of
your
position
is
that
it
has
those
harshest
consequences
in
those
rare
cases
where
there
was
a
denial
of
constitutional
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
the
real
problem
with
the
capital
cases?
the
state's
interest
in
getting
things
moving
is
the
strongest
in
the
capital
cases,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
non-capital
cases
there
is
an
interest
in
promptness,
but
the
longer
the
guy
stays
in
jail
is
not
going
to
prejudice
the
state.
but
you
do
want
to
get
your
death
cases
terminated
as
soon
as
you
can.
and
what
we're
really
talking
about
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
in
most
death
cases
we'll
add
on
a
period
of
six,
eight,
nine
months
to
the
total
period.
and
in
most
of
those
death
cases,
which
is
a
limited
number...
i
don't
know,
you
have
a
couple
hundred
people
i
suppose
in
death
row...
in
those
cases
it's
going
to
be
seven,
eight,
nine
years
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
title
of
a
statute
indicate
the
category
of
cases
that
congress
was
primarily
interested
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
death
penalty.
