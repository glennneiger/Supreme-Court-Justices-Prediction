justice
clarence
thomas
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
lawrence
v.
florida,
number
05-8820.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
gary
lawrence
was
convicted
in
state
court
of
first
degree
murder
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
364
days
passed
before
lawrence
passed
a
petition
for
state
postconviction
relief
which
was
rejected
by
the
florida
courts.
after
the
florida
supreme
court
issued
its
mandate
denying
state
postconviction
relief
lawrence
waited
another
113
days
to
file
his
federal
habeas
petition
application.
despite
the
federal
habeas
statute’s
one
year
limitation
period,
lawrence
argues
that
his
federal
habeas
application
is
timely
because
he
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
seeking
review
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
denial
of
state
postconviction
relief.
specifically
lawrence
maintains
that
his
application
for
a
state
postconviction
review
was
still
pending
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
habeas
statute
until
this
court
denied
his
certiorari
petition.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioner’s
argument
and
held
that
his
habeas
application
was
untimely.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
the
certiorari
petition
was
not
part
of
the
applications
for
state
postconviction
review
and
that
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
equitable
tolling
of
the
federal
limitations
period.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
an
application
for
a
state
postconviction
review
is
no
longer
pending
once
the
state
courts
have
conclusively
spoken
on
the
matter
and
all
that
remains
as
a
certiorari
petition
pending
before
this
federal
court.
the
federal
habeas
statute
tolls
the
statute
of
limitations
during
the
time
when
an
application
for
state
postconviction
or
other
collateral
review
is
pending.
so,
the
question
is,
whether
such
an
application
is
still
pending,
when
a
certiorari
petition
is
filed
in
this
court
to
review
a
state
court’s
denial
of
the
postconviction
relief.
we
have
previously
said
that
a
state
postconviction
application
remains
pending
until
the
application
has
achieved
final
resolution
through
the
state’s
postconviction
procedures
and
today
we
hold
that
state
review
ends
when
the
state
courts
have
finally
resolved
an
application
for
state
postconviction
relief.
after
the
state’s
highest
court
has
issued
its
mandate
or
denied
review
no
other
state
avenues
for
relief
remain
open
and
an
application
for
state
post-conviction
review
no
longer
exists
all
that
remains
is
a
separate
certiorari
petition
pending
before
a
federal
court.
thus,
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
does
not
toll
the
limitations
period
and
accordingly
petitioner’s
federal
habeas
application
was
untimely.
petitioner
has
not
presented
any
circumstances
that
justify
the
use
of
equitable
tolling
to
forgive
the
un-timeliness
of
his
application.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
dismiss
petitioner’s
claim.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
