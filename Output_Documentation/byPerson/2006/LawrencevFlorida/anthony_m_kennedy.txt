i
suppose
you'd
have
to
file
a
protective
petition
with
the
district
court
saying
we
won
but
we
might
still
lose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
provided
equitable--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
the
congress
has
written
a
statute
which
doesn't
take
account
that
the
state
might
sometimes
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
that
would
be
granted.
and
you
say
oh,
that's
so
rare,
that's
so
extraordinary.
it
happens.
it's
part
of
the
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
accept
your
view
as
being
the
personal
experience.
i'm
rather
surprised
that
district
courts
would
go
through
all
of
these
preliminary
steps
when
the
case
is
on
cert
and
they
may
not
have
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
if
i
would
tell
the
district
courts
that's
what
they
ought
to
do,
is
a
wise
expenditure
of
resources.
i'll
think
about
that.
