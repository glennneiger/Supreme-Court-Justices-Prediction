mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
common
law
rule
banning
parental
pro
se
representation
is
as
longstanding
as
it
is
pervasive.
appreciating
the
fact
that
the
idea
does
not
abrogate
the
common
law
rule,
petitioners
instead
seek
to
circumvent
that
through
this
substantive
rights
theory.
if
a
due
process
complaint
never
raised
any
issue
of
parental
substantive
rights,
nor
even
did
their
cert
petition,
which
at
page
11
said
children
had
substantive
rights
but
parents
have
procedural
rights.
now,
however,
they
tell
this
court
that
the
right...
the
parents'
substantive
right
is
so
ingrained
in
the
fabric
of
the
statute
that
the
courts
should
recognize
it.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
your
honor,
i
would
classify
that
as
not
a
right,
it's
a
remedy.
it
is
a
remedy
premised
on
the
denial
of
the
fape
to
the
child.
and
as
a
result,
it
is
simply
a
derivative
claim
for
the
parents
to
recover
those
funds.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's,
and
that's
how
1412
is
structured,
the
provisions
about
reimbursement.
it
depends
upon
the
predicate
finding
that
the
child
was
denied
a
fape
and
therefore
one
of
the
remedies,
among
other
remedies,
compensatory
education
and
so
forth,
is
reimbursement.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
your
honor,
certainly
that
has
been
one
of
the
emphases
by
petitioners,
but
the
response
to
that
is
that
the
free
aspect
of
the
free
appropriate
public
education
does
not
give
parents
a
substantive
right
to
the
education
itself.
we
are
not
talking...
we
are
debating
in
this
case,
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
are
debating
the
a
aspect,
the
appropriateness.
we
are
not
saying,
we
have
not
expelled
the
student
and
therefore
they
have
a
claim
based
on
that.
it
is
simply--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--your
honor--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--our
position
is
it
would
be
paid
to
the
child.
the
child
would
be
the
party
that
could
bring
that
claim.
and
i
just
would
like
to
clarify.
if
you
look
at
page
153
of
the--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--and
your
honor,
that
is
how
the
court,
lower
courts
in
the
third
circuit,
where
the
collinsgru
rule
prevails,
that's
how
they
apply
it.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
that
is,
that
is
exactly
the
scenario
in
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
they
cited
in
2007.
and
they
said
it's,
the
child's
estate
is
the
one
that
brings
the
claim.
now
in
that
case,
the
child
had
actually
expended
the
funds.
but
that
case
upheld
the
rule
that
we
were
advocating
here.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
you've
got
to
assume--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--your
honor,
i
think
it
is
no
different
than
a
basic
attorney
fee
award.
there's
not,
there's
not
a
claim
that...
that,
you
know,
if
someone
else,
if
the
uncle
pays
the
attorneys'
fees
that
didn't
negate
the
award
of
fees
on
behalf
of
the
child.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
because
the
claim
would
have
to
be
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child,
because
they
would
not
have
the
capacity
to
bring
the
claim
itself,
the
award
would
go
straight
to
the,
to
the
guardian,
who
may
be
the
parent
that
is
proceeding
on
their
behalf.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
but
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that's
the
pragmatic
result
that
congress
intended
here.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
your
honor--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--well,
the
guardian
can
certainly
bring
the
claim
on
behalf
of
the
child.
but
its'
different
than
bringing
the
claim
in
their
own
right.
and
i
would
point
that
at
page
153
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
specifies
at
the...
at
the
administrative
hearing
level,
there
was
no
claim
for
reimbursement
to
the
parents.
in
fact,
what
they
were
seeking
was
reimbursement
to
monarch,
to
the
school.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
the
administrative
record
disclosed
they
had
not
actually
paid
the
funds.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
about
the
distinction
between
the
procedural
and
the
substance
in
the
act,
congress
made
clear--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
generally,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
just--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--i'll
do
my
best.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
let
me
try
to
explain,
justice
breyer.
the
reason
is
as
petitioners
effectively
conceded
in
their
reply
brief,
party
aggrieved
does
depend
on
the
party
entitled
to
the
remedy.
and
if
we
look
at
the
amendment
in
1415(f)(3)(e),
which
was
just
added
in
2004,
it
clarifies
that
all
relief
that
the
hearing
officer
should
award
is
based
on
substantive
violation
to
the
child.
and
it's
important
that
if
we
look
to
the
entirety
of
subchapter
2,
there
are
more
than
two
dozen
references
to
the
right,
to
the
obligation,
to
the
provision
of
a
fape
to
the
child.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
the
dispute
resolution
provisions
hinge
on
vindicating
the
child's
right.
and
i
think
the
question
earlier
to
mr.
salmons
was--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--i'm
sorry,
which
section?
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
oh,
1415(f)(3)(e},
i'm
focusing
on
21
a
of
the
blue
brief,
your
honor.
and
once
that
section--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--21
a
of
the
blue
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
it's
1415(f)(3)(e).
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
(f)(3)(e).
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
(f)(3)(e)
is
on
21a
of
my
version
of
the
blue
brief,
your
honor.
that's
the
provision
that's
titled
decision
of
the
hearing
officer,
and
provides
that
the
hearing
officer
should
grant
relief
on
substantive
grounds.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's
not
my
brief,
your
honor,
i
apologize.
in
any
event,
it
limits
the
hearing
officer's
ability
to
reward
relief
based
on
the
substantive,
whether
the
substantive
right
to
the
fape
has
been
awarded
or
not.
and
then
we
return
to
justice
breyer's
point
about
the
party
aggrieved,
the
party
aggrieved
by
the
finding
or
decision.
because
the
decision
is
limited
to
substantive
grounds,
that
is
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here.
and
i
think
one
of
the
confusing
aspects
about
what
the
nature
of
the
substantive
right
is,
and
i
think
we've
heard
some
different
versions
of
that
this
morning,
is
what
is
the
scope.
petitioners
in
their
reply
brief
seem
to
try
to
retreat
a
little
bit
and
make
the
rights
more
palatable.
but
if
they...
in
doing
so,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
right
different
than
the
child's
right?
and
we
simply
do
not
have
the
answer
to
that,
and
for
the
school
districts
applying
this
act
on
a
daily
basis,
and
for
courts
interpreting
it,
it
simply
poses
numerous
problems
trying
to
apply
to
a
parent
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
benefit
children.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
i
would
not--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--well,
he
can't
decide
against
the
parent
because
the
only
issue
at
stake
is
the
right
of
the
child.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
he
won't
have
a
right
taken
away
from
him
because
it's
not...
it's
not
his
claim
at
stake
in
the
due
process
hearing.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right.
we
simply
feel
that
because
the
reimbursement,
as
i
said
before,
hinges
on
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
the
child
and
not
the
deprivation
of
the
substantive
right
to
the
parent,
it
is
the
child's
claim
to
bring.
i
appreciate--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--and
here's
how
i
would
explain
it,
justice
souter.
the
right,
the
substantive
right
is
the
right
to
a
fape
to
the
child.
and
because
the
child
does
not
have
capacity,
congress
implemented
a
pragmatic
system
to
allow
the
parents
to
protect
those
rights.
it's
derivative
for
the
parent
to
protect
the
child's
right--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--that
is
exactly
what
1415(m)
says,
your
honor.
that
allows
a
transfer
of
rights.
and
1415(m)
is
at
11a
and
12a
of
the
red
brief,
and
i
hope
i've
got
the
cite
right
this
time.
1415(m)
allows
for
states
to
require,
and
ohio
does,
to
require
the
transfer
of
all
rights
under
subchapter
2
that
a
parent
would
otherwise
have,
straight
to
the
child.
so
basically--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--that's
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
and
that's
my...
that's
part
of
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
oh.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
because
the
child
lacks
capacity,
they
can't
do
all
these
things
on
their
own
until
they
reach
majority.
but
once
they
do
and
the
rights
transfer,
it
illustrates
that
it's
not
really
the
parents'
rights,
it
is
the
child's
right
that
they
are
protecting.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right.
and
those
would
be
the
procedural
safeguards
that
are
delineated
in
the
act.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
let
me
clarify
then.
i
wasn't
denying
the
existence
of
the
procedural
safeguard.
to
the
contrary,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
are
not
redressible
independent
of
themselves
in
federal
court
unless...
and
this
is
what
1415(f)(3)(e)
clarifies,
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
substantive
violation.
because
if
you
think
of
a
situation
in
which
the
child
is
provided
a
fape,
no
one
disputes
that,
but
a
parent
says
well,
you
didn't
invite
me
to
a
meeting,
what's
your
remedy
there?
there
is
no
remedy.
and
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
clarify.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
your
honor,
if
you
look
at...
i'll
direct
you
to
the
dibuo
case
and
the
lesesne
case,
i'm
probably
mispronouncing
both
of
them--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--okay.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
your
honor,
the...
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
clarify
in
2004.
they
did
not
want
technical
procedural
violations
to
eclipse
the
substantive
rights,
and
so
what
they
provided
was
the
substantive
right
is
the
only
one
that
is
important.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
the
parent...
the
parent's
procedural
rights
are
gone.
i
mean,
remember--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--yes.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
your
honor,
because
that...
again,
that
was
what
congress
was
trying
to
clarify
in
2004.
and
if
you
look
at
the
dibuo
case
and
the
lesesne
case
cited
on
page
27
of
the
sg's
brief,
both
those
cases
make
clear
that
notwithstanding
procedural
violations,
there
must
actually
be
a
causation,
there
must
actually
be
substantive
harm
before
any
relief
can
flow
from
that.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
your
honor,
if
the
parent
would
otherwise
have
a
1983
claim
under
1415(l),
if
it
relates
to
an
idea
claim,
there
would
have
to
be
exhaustion
first.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's
right.
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
if
you
look
at
1411(e)(3)(e),
which
is
5a
of
the
red
brief,
and
i'm
sorry
to
keep
jumping
briefs
on
you,
that
provides
that
litigation
brought
to
secure
the
right
of
the
child
to
a
fape
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child.
so
congress
added
both
that
section
and
the
section
you
were
just
referring
to
at
the
same
time,
and
the
only
way
to
read
them
harmoniously
is
that
any
action
that
is
being
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child
to
secure
the
fape,
it's
not
the
parent's
own
action
that
they
are
bringing,
they
are
bringing
it
on
their
own...
on
behalf
of
the
child.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
1411(e)(3)(e),
on
5a
of
the
red
brief.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
yes.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
recognized
that
when
legal
action
is
being
brought
to
secure
fape,
just
like
it's
the
child's
right
to
the
fape
under
subchapter
2,
it
is
being
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child.
and
that's
where
petitioners
run
into
problem
with
the
common
rule
law,
because
the
common
law
rule
that
they
don't
dispute
is
that
parents
cannot
bring
claims
on
behalf
of
the
child
pro
se.
so
they
have
to
find
a
way
to
abrogate,
and
they
initially
argued
in
the
opening
brief
for
an
exception
to
the
common
law
rule,
which
from
my
reading
of
the
reply
brief
they
have
abandoned.
so
the
core
issue
in
dispute
as
far
as
the
petitioners
go
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
substantive
right.
and
i'd
like
to
make
the--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--it's
the
high
cost,
one
of
the
high
cost
funds
for
states,
justice
ginsburg.
i'd
like
to
make--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
indicative
of
what
congress
appreciated
the
claim
would
look
like
on
any
level,
and
it's
not
simply
saying
that
those
funds
aren't
provided
under
subparagraph
(d).
that
is
the
nature
of
the
claim.
regardless
of
under
what
section
we
are
looking
at,
that
is
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
could
be
brought
in
order
to
secure
a
fape
for
the
child,
and
in
every
circumstance,
it
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
one
point,
if
i
can,
about
the
spending
clause,
in
response
to
petitioner's
argument
in
the
reply
brief.
petitioners
effectively
say
that
the
spending
clause
doesn't
apply
because
this
is
not
an
issue
of
liability.
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
again
to
rowley,
where
at
footnotes
11
and
26
the
court
recognized
the
difference
between
the
educational
benefit
which
is
the
fape,
and
maximizing
the
educational
outcome.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
no.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that's
what...
i
think
there
have
been
four
circuits
who
addressed
that
in
the
context
of
attorney
parents,
and
they've
all
said
that
they
cannot
get
fees.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
arlington
did
not
limit
it
to
simply
liability.
it
said
repeatedly
obligations
and
conditions.
and
that's
exactly
what
rowley
was
looking
at
in
footnotes
11
and
26.
we
don't
necessarily
have...
have
to
have
a
line
item
that
there's
going
to
be
x
dollars
in
damage.
it
was
simply
the
difference
between
an
educational
benefit
and
maximizing
that
benefit
that
triggered
spending
cost
concerns
in
rowley.
just
like
in
south
dakota
v
dole
the
issue
of
whether
someone
was
21
in
order
to
consume
alcohol
was
not
necessarily
a
liability
but
it
was
a
very
important
obligation
or
condition
imposed
upon
the
state.
and
their
second
point
regarding
the
spending
clause
is
that
not
every
single
detail
needs
to
be
fleshed
out
in
clear
notice.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
no.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
i'm
sorry?
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
little
bit
different
because
part
of
the...
part
of
the
real
issue
here
is
not
necessarily
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
to
the
other
party,
but
it's
the
incurrence
of
attorneys'
fees
defending--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--and...
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
and...
and
just
to
clarify,
congress
hasn't
provided
any
funds
for
this.
i
mean
they,
they
recognized
in
2004
they
were
only
funding
19
percent
of
the
obligations
of
the
statute,
and
we
have
to
pick
up
the
balance
of
the
tab.
and
their
other
argument
on
the
spending
clause
is
that
it's,
you
don't
have
to
flesh
out
everything
in
the
statute
but
here
we're
talking
about
two
core
issues.
one
is
abrogating
the
common
rule
law
and
the
other
is
creation
of
substantive
rights
to
an
entirely
new
class
of
beneficiaries.
if
there's
ever
anything
that
demanded
clear
notice,
this
is
it.
it
is
much
more
serious
and
severe
than
the
expert
fees
at
issue
in
arlington,
and
school
districts
and
states
simply
have
to
have
notice,
what
is
the
parameter
of
the
right
that
you
are
being
requested
to
recognize?
and
based
on
the
briefing,
and
based
on
what
we
have
heard
in
argument,
it
is
simply
not
clear
to
the
school
districts
not
only
what
the
nature
of
the
right
is
but
how
to
apply
it.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well...
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
from...
from
listening
to
the
argument
today,
i
mean,
petitioner
acknowledged
the
child
falls
out
of
the
equation.
this
is
a
statute
that
needs
to
benefit
the
child,
and
they're
taking
the
child
completely
out.
and
so
what
is
the
nature
of
this
parental
right?
the
sg
says
well,
it's
all,
it's
all
intertwined.
but
if
we
look
at
what
petitioner
said--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--justice
ginsburg,
in
litigating
this
case
while
the
winkelmans
were
pro
se,
we
expended
far
greater
than
the
$8,000
at
issue
in
arlington,
on
our
legal
fees
defending--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
remember
at
the
time
the
congress
reauthorized
in
2004,
every
circuit
that
had
addressed
it
besides
the
first
had
agreed
that
parents
could
not
bring
a
pro
se.
so
the
states
reasonably
would
not
have
believed,
especially
in
the
circuits
where
it
was
decided,
that
they
would
have
to...
have
to
come
up
with
these
funds.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
well,
if
you,
in
the
dissent
in
arlington,
they
made...
justice
breyer
made
a
basically
materiality
argument
and
the
majority
did
not
seem
moved
by
it.
so
i
think,
this
is
something
that
is
very
significant,
not
simply
on
the
dollars
involved,
but
how
we
apply
this
substantive
right
to
parents
that
petitioners
seek
to
have
recognized.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
that
wouldn't
solve
the
issue
of,
under
the
common
law
the
guardian
ad
litem
would
not
have
the
ability
to
receive
pro
se
on
the
common
law
fees,
the
same
as
the
parent.
the
rule
is
the
same.
so
they
would
still
have--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--that's
right.
unless
they're...
unless
they
have...
unless
they
are
an
attorney.
which
in
many
cases
the
appointment
to
someone
who
is
an
attorney.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
justice
souter,
we
don't
because
most
of
the
circuits
were
saying
this
is...
we're
not
going
to
allow
pro
se--
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
--no.
mr.
pierre
h.
bergeron
no
we
checked
and
couldn't
find
anything,
your
honor.
