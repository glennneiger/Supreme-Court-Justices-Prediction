they
are
an
aggrieved
party
for
purposes
of
the
administrative
process.
the
question
is
whether
that...
when
that
is
done,
whether
they
also
constitute
an
aggrieved
party.
and
one
of
the...
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
other
side
is
that
there
is
an
express
provision
for
proceeding
without
counsel
at
the
administrative
level,
and
there's
no
provision
for
proceeding
without
counsel
in
court.
so
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
right
to
proceed
pro
se
is
limited
to
the
administrative
process?
justice
ruth
bader

but
then
you
would
be
establishing
a
right
for
the
least
needy.
i
mean,
if
they're
seeking
reimbursement,
they're
able
to
pay
the
private
school
tuition.
it's
the
people
who
can't...
who
have
no
alternative,
they
have
to
take
what
the
school
district
gives
them
because
they
don't
have
the
wherewithal
to
enroll
their
child
in
a
private
school.
and
your
argument,
concentrating
on
the
reimbursement
right,
would
leave
out
those
people,
would
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
provision
that
says
at
no
cost
to
the
parent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
when
the
child
reaches
majority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
child
is
no
longer
a
child,
the
child
is
an
adult.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
section
you
pointed
to
that
says
disbursements
under
subparagraph
(d),
but
your
brief
doesn't
include
subparagraph
(d).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
if
this
provision
is
limited
to
subparagraph
(d),
how
can
you
argue
that
it
covers
the
waterfront?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
agree
we're
talking
about.
what
is
the
toll
on
the
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
would
have
to
pay
for
a
lawyer,
if
it
lost,
and
that
parents
who
brings
the
case
is
not
entitled
to
reimbursement,
how
is
the
state's
pocketbook
affected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
claiming
that
hiring
an
attorney
would
be
a
cost,
if
the
phrase
"at
no
cost
to
the
parent.
"
if
they
have
to
hire
an
attorney,
that
the
cost--
