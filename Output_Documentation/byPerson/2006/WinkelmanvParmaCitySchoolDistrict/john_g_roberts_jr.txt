chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
05-983,
winkelman
versus
parma
city
school
district.
mr.
andre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
they're
the
co-architects.
i
mean,
are
you
saying
anything
more
than
they
are
given
the
procedural
right
to
participate
in
the
hearing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
there
a
bit
of...
there's
a
leap
from
saying
they
have
these
various
procedural
rights
and
they're
are
a
party
aggrieved
by
the
decision
rendered
after
the
hearing,
that's
a
different
question,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
just
begs
the
question,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you're
assuming
that
the
parents
are
a
party
to
the
case
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
the
unanimous
view
of
the
circuits
that
parents,
as
a
general
matter,
do
not
have
the
right
to
represent
their
children
in
federal
court,
that
the
provision
of
the
judicial
code
that
you
cited
does
not
confer
on
parents,
generally,
the
right
to
represent
children.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
statute
already
allows
the
shifting
of
fees
to
a
prevailing
party.
so
presumably
attorneys
can
be
found
to
take
the
meritorious
cases.
and
what
we
are
probably
dealing
with
are
cases
that
can't
attract
attorneys,
even
though
the
attorneys
know
that
if
they
win,
they
will
get
their
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
they
had
that
overriding
intent,
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
them
to
make
clear
that
this
was
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule,
that
parents
don't
have
the
right
to
represent
children
in
court.
they
did
that
with
respect
to
the
administrative
proceeding,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out.
they
perhaps
conspicuously
did
not
do
it
with
respect
to
the
proceeding
in
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
14...
is
it
1415(f)?
specifically
says
that
parents
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
due
process
hearing.
i'm
looking
at
1415(f)(1)(a).
in
other
words,
parents
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
due
process
hearing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
they
have
the
right
to
participate
as
parties.
they
have...
it
says
they
have
the
right
to...
for
an
impartial
due
process
hearing.
i
would
suppose
if
you're
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
the
party
to
that
case,
you
would
still
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
child
and
not
the
parents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
andre.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
argument
proves
a
little
too
much.
if
you
have
a
child
who
is
the
victim
of
a
tort,
for
example,
and
suffers
a
serious
injury,
it
is
the
parents
who
are
going
to
have
to
bear
the
costs
of
accommodating
that
injury.
and
yet
in
any
tort
action,
it's
still
the
child
who
is
the
party
and
not
the
parent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
their,
their
rights...
so
their
right
to
proceed
in
federal
court
should
be
limited
to
the
rights
that
you've
identified
under
the
statute
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
the
child?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
think...
you
think
their...
their,
their
rights...
the
rights
they
can
assert
are
only
ones
they
can
identify
as
their
own
as
opposed
to
the
child's?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
not...
it
is
not
just
party
aggrieved.
it's
party
aggrieved
by
the
findings
and
decision,
as
opposed
to
party
aggrieved
by
a
denial
of
the
procedural
right,
and
those
strike
me
as
two
different
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
bergeron?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
a
parent
have
a
right
to
bring
a
1983
action
if
their
procedural
rights
under
this
statute
are
interfered
with
by
the
state
actors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
i
understand
your
argument
based
on
3(e),
but
when
i
look
at
21a
of
my
blue
brief
there's
another
provision
on
attorneys'
fees
and
it's
phrased
in
a
very
curious
way.
it
says
that
fees
are
allowed
to
a
prevailing
party
who
is
the
parent
of
a
child
with
a
disability.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
most
difficult
express
language
for
you
to
deal
with.
it
doesn't
say
attorneys'
fees
happen
to
be
allowed
to
parents,
it's
to
a
prevailing
party
who
is
a
parent.
and
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
a
parent
can
never
be
a
prevailing
party.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
attorneys'
fees
allowed
to
a
parent
who
is
bringing
one
of
these
cases
on
behalf
of
a
child
pro
se?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
convoluted
question.
okay.
so
there's
no
issue
under
the
spending
clause
that
a
non-attorney
parent
would
be
able
to
claim
some
sort
of
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
is
the
spending
clause
issue
very
significant
in
terms
of
the
exposure
of
the
school
boards?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
where
i
have
a
little
bit
of
trouble.
it's
not...
the
underlying
right
is
still
the
same.
it's
the
right
of
the
child
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
and
that
can
be
vindicated
in
court
actions
by
attorneys
who
get
their
fees
paid
if
they
prevail,
and
all
we're
talking
about
is
a
situation
where
the
parents
can
assert
that
same
right
when
an
attorney
won't.
and
i'm
just
wondering
how
significant
additional
exposure
we're
talking
about?
and
what
turns
on
that
is
whether
to
take
the
spending
clause
argument
seriously
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
you
would
have
had
to
do
that
if
they
had
gotten
a
lawyer
to
take
the
case.
what,
what
your
spending
clause
argument
is,
the
state
agreed
to
undertake
this
liability,
that
they
would
have
to
provide
a
free
and
appropriate
education,
that
if
they
litigated,
they
would
have
pay
the
other
side's
attorneys'
fees.
but
if
they
knew
that
in
the
case
where
an
attorney
wouldn't
take
it,
the
parents
could
prosecute
it,
and
that
might
result
in
overturning
their
decision
and
that
might
result
in
greater
expense,
well,
in
that
case
they
would
not
have
bought
into
this
deal
at
all.
that
seems
a
little
implausible.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
disputing
that
it
results
in
additional
exposure.
i'm
just
disputing
that
it
affects
the
voluntariness
of
their
agreement
to
undertake
the
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bergeron.
mr.
andre,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
didn't
congress
just
add
the
provision
making
this
very
clear
that
the
senate
had
passed,
why
did
the
house
boot
it
out
of
the
conference
bill?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
think
it's
totally
inapplicable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
think
it
is
not
violated,
not
that
it
doesn't
apply
for
some
reason?
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
spending
clause
legislation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
no.
