what
can
the
parents
get
out
of
this
case
other
than
reimbursement
for
the
tuition
they've
paid
to
private
schools
and
procedural
rights
that
are
given

by

what
can
they
get
out
of
this
case
other
than
those
two
things
that
do
not
depend
upon
their
status
as
representatives
of
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
possible
relief
could
they
seek
other
than
giving
them
a
procedural
right
accorded
by
the
act?
what
other
possible
relief
could
they
seek
that
they
would
not
be
seeking
as
guardians
of
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
upon
their
being
a
party
aggrieved.
that
is
defined
in
black's
law
dictionary
as
a
party
entitled
to
a
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
if
the
only
remedies
the
parents
are
entitled
to
in
their
own
right
are
reimbursement,
which
is
at
issue
here,
and
procedural
guarantees,
why
would
not
their
ability
to
sue
or
to
appear
pro
se
be
limited
to
those
two
categories?
you'd
win
this
case,
but
i'm
talking
about
how
broad
is
the
rule
that
you're
urging
us
to
adopt?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
child
is.
the
child
is
entitled
to
an
appropriate
public
education
and
the
parents
are
entitled
to
have
it
provided
free.
that's
really
the
only
interest
they
have
on
the
table,
it
seems
to
me,
separate
and
apart
from
their
status
as
representatives
or
guardians
of
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it's
not
an
insignificant
matter
at
issue
here.
counsel,
who
are
referred
to
as
officers
of
the
court,
protect
the
court
from
frivolous
suits,
from
suits
that
really
have
no
basis.
when
we
give
that
authority
to
appear
in
court
and
initiate
a
suit
to
the
public
at
large,
we
make
a
lot
more
work
for
federal
district
judges.
why
should
we
interpret
this
statute
to
achieve
that
unusual
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
disadvantaged
parents
that
you
are
referring
to
who
comprise
the
majority
of
parents,
they're
really
up
on
section,
you
know,
(h)(1)
and
all
that
stuff?
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
i
mean,
the
people
you're
assertedly
benefiting
here
are
the
people
least
likely
to
have
familiarized
themselves
with
the
statute
and
the
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
it
right
after
reading
pro
se
prisoner
petitions,
right?
you'd
have
a
nice
evening's
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
quoted
from
4(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
still
haven't
said
anything.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
they
can
sue
for
the
money
and
they
can
sue
for
denied
procedures.
but
if
all
the
procedures
are
given
and
they're
still
not
satisfied
with
the
public
education
that
is
given,
they
would
not
be
able
to
sue
claiming--
that
it
was
inadequate
under
the
terms
of
the
act.
you
think
they
can
sue
then,
too,
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
haven't
said
anything
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
haven't
limited
the
scope
of
the
parent's
right
to
sue
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
you've
given
the
procedure
but
where
does
the
act
guarantee
the
parents
the
proper
outcome?
the
proper...
assignment?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
give
the
parents
the
right
procedures
explicitly
and
the
rights
to
reimbursement
for...
for
private
tuition.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
right,
where...
where
is
that
right
contained?
you
have
given
us
citations
for
the
other
ones.
where
is
that
right
contained?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
initiate
a
suit
solely
on
the
basis...
not
that
i
was
denied
procedures,
not
that
i,
i
paid
money
for
private
schooling,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
outcome,
the
education
given
to
my
child
in
the
public
school
was
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
the
right...
they
have
the
right
to
the
hearing.
but
do
they
have
the
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
they
have
a
right
in
and
of
themselves...
not
as
guardians...
do
they
have
the
right
to
a
particular
outcome
in
the
hearing?
that's,
that's
the
point
i'm
inquiring
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
that
section
you
just
alluded
to?
i'm
blasting
by
it.
where
is
it,
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--f--
justice
antonin
scalia
--21
a
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
which
is
the
statutory
section
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
14.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
it's
not
18(a)?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
18(a)
of
mine,
too.
maybe
i
have
a
different
brief
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
stands
in
the
way
of
that
analysis
is
the
text,
which
says
all
other
rights
accorded
to
parents
under
this
subchapter
transfer
to
the
child.
not
only
doesn't
that
help
you,
it
seems
to
me
it
hurts
you.
it
acknowledges
that
there
are
rights
accorded
to
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
you
were
denying
them,
as
i
understood
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
section
you
cited?
justice
antonin
scalia
(e)(3)(e).
justice
antonin
scalia
legal
fees.
the
disbursements
under
subparagraph
(d)
shall
not
support
legal
fees,
court
costs,
or
other
costs
associated
with
the
cause
of
action
brought
on
behalf
of
a
child
with
a
disability
to
ensure
a
free
and
appropriate
public--
education
for
such
child.
what
do
you
think
that
proves?
