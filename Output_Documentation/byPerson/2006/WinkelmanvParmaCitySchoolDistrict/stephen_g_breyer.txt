justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
this
to
do...
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
puzzled
about
why
we're
talking
about
this
complicated
thing.
i
mean
why...
the
statute
as
i
read
it
has
a
section
and
it's
called
procedural,
procedural
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
says
that
the
procedural
rights,
right
at
the
beginning,
are
for
both
the
children
and
the
parents.
and
it
sets
up
some
procedures
in
the
agency
which
is
for
the
children
and
the
parents
and
school
board,
and
everybody
is
supposed
to
be
there.
and
then
another
part
of
the
same
section
says
any
person
aggrieved
by
the
first
has
a
court
hearing.
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
it's
clearly
aimed,
as
the
statute
is
aimed,
at
both
students
and
parents.
and
then
we
give
them
all
procedural
rights,
and
what
in
the
statute
says
that
the
procedures
that
they're
following
before
the
school
board
happen
to
be
for
both
parents
and
students.
but
without
saying
a
word,
a
different
procedure,
a
federal
court
procedure
in
the
same
section,
without
saying
anything,
would
be
just
for
the
students
and
not
for
the
parents?
i
mean,
i
find
that
hard
to
read
the
statute
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
the
whole
act.
throughout
the
whole
act,
they
talk
about
parents
and
students.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
who
writes
the
check?
the
student?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
of
course.
the
parent
writes
the
check.
and
has
the
interest?
i
have
an
interest
in
educating
my
children
as
you
do
in
yours.
and
this
statute
talks
about
that
throughout.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
looking
at
the
particular
words
in
the
procedural
section,
and
the
particular
words
explicitly
say
that
every
subsection
is
both
for
parent,
through
child;
and
then
we
get
to
the
court
one
and
it
talks
about
person
aggrieved.
and
you,
i
guess,
have
to
convince
me...
which
as
i'm
putting
it,
sounds
like
an
uphill
battle--
[laughter]
but
you
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
to
convince
me
that
person
aggrieved
at
the
at
the
end
of
this
section
is
meant
to
apply
to
only
some
of
the
people
whom
every
other
section
talks
about,
namely
just
children,
not
parents.
now
why
should
i
read
that
it
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
argument,
i
guess,
is
this
argument.
now
you're
conceding
the
parent
does
have
a
right
to
go
to
court,
but
he
can
only
complain
about
something
that
hurts
him.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can't
complain
in
court
or...
well,
it
sounds
as
if
you
were
saying
that.
you're
saying
that
the
hearing
officer
has
to
decide
against
the
parent
and
if
he
doesn't
decide
against
the
parent,
obviously
the
parent
can't
go
into
court
because
he
doesn't
have
anything
to
complain
about,
the
parent.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well...
right.
i'm
sorry.
then
you
go
ahead.
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
the
problem
is
that
the
parent
didn't
have
a
right
taken
away
by
the
hearing
officer,
and
that's
why
the
parent
can't
go
to
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
would
agree,
we
can
be
on
the
same
grounds
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
that
if
the
parent
isn't
hurt,
if
the
parent
wasn't
deprived
of
anything,
the
parents
can
go
to
court
but
doesn't
have
anything
to
complain
about,
you
know,
whereas
another
section
of
the
statute
says
that
reimbursement
is
something
supposed
to
be
reimbursement
for
the
parent,
so
it
would
seem
as
if
the
panther
has
something
to
complain
about.
isn't
that
so?
it
says
the...
i
think
so...
it
says
a
parent
is
to
be
reimbursed.
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
things
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
now
it
looks
as
if
the
parent
has
something
to
complain
about.
the
parent
hasn't
got
the
money
that
he
was
supposed
to
get.
now
we
have
something
to
complain
about,
so
therefore,
we're
aggrieved,
and
then
the
last
section
says
an
aggrieved
person
can
go
to
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
take
it
your
argument
is,
your
red
brief
argument
is
that
congress
said,
states,
if
you
get
some
judgments
against
you
and
they
award
attorneys'
fees,
you
pay
for
it,
we
won't?
is
that
what
it
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
pay
for
it,
you
can't
pay
for
it
out
of
the
grant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we're
not
paying
for
this,
you
pay
for
it.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
states--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
some
people
bring
claims
against
you
under
this
because
you
didn't
have
a
good
plan
for
the
child
and
your
attorneys'
fees
are
awarded
against
you,
don't
pay
for
it
out
of
this
grant.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying
it
says?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
what
your
argument
was...
and
if
it's
not,
forget
it,
it's
just
that
i
don't
understand
it.
that
here
the
government
says
pay
for
this
out
of
your
own
pocket,
and
then
its
defines
what
you're
supposed
to
pay
out
of
our
own
pocket
is,
as
a
parent
representing
a
child,
not
his
own
action.
and
then
later
on
they
say,
they
define
it
differently.
they
talk
about
prevailing
party.
the
parents
of
the
prevailing
party.
but
you
say
that
second
phrase
must
mean
the
first
phrase.
because
it
wouldn't
make
sense
for
the
government
to
say
pay
for
that
out
of
the
grant
but
not
this
out
of
the
grant.
that's
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
it
is
an
argument.
