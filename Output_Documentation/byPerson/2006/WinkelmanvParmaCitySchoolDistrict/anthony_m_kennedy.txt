if
we
say
that
the
parents
are
the
real
party
in
interest
and
are
entitled
to
sue
in
their
own
right,
is
that
the
end
of
the
case,
or
do
we
reach
the
second...
a
second
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
represent
the
children?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
their
an
argument
at
any
point
in
this
case
that
the
claim
was
frivolous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
following
you.
where
is
this
provision?
1401
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
court
appoint
the
parent
guardian
ad
litem
and
just
the
parent
proceed
as
guardian
ad
litem?
justice
anthony
m.

the
guardian
ad

cannot
proceed
pro

the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
mr.
and
mrs.
winkelman
and
their
young
son
jacob.
some
four
years
ago
the
senior
winkelman
sought
review
relating
to
concerns
they
had
over
whether
jacob
would
progress
well
at
the
elementary
school
to
which
he
has
been
assigned.
jacob
who
has
autism
spectrum
disorder
is
covered
by
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act
called
idea.
this
is
a
federal
law,
it
entitles
jacob
to
certain
protections
and
remedies
including
the
ability
to
bring
suit
into
federal
court
to
ensure
his
school
district
have
provided
him
with
what
the
statute
calls
a
free
appropriated
public
education.
the
question
here
is
whether
idea
also
entitles
jacob’s
parents
to
certain
protections
and
remedies
so
that
they
too
may
bring
suit
in
federal
court.
jacob’s
parents
seek
to
sue
on
their
own
behalf
because
if
they
are
permitted
to
do
so,
they
would
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
court
without
an
attorney.
the
parma
city
school
district
in
parma
city,
ohio
is
the
respondent
in
the
case.
the
school
district
argues
that
idea
accords
the
rights
here
and
question
is
only
to
children
not
to
their
parents
as
well.
we
find
that
text
of
this
statute
forecloses
this
interpretation.
idea
defines
one
of
its
purposes
as
seeking
to
ensure
that
the
rights
of
children
with
disabilities
and
parents
of
such
children
are
protected
and
that
word
writes
in
this
language
refers
to
the
rights
of
parents
as
well
as
the
rights
of
the
child
otherwise
the
grammatical
structure
would
make
no
sense.
the
school
district
nevertheless
claims
that
the
sole
purpose
driving
idea’s
involvement
of
parents
is
to
facilitate
vindication
of
a
child’s
rights
so
the
district
would
have
us
read
the
statutes
many
references
to
parents’
rights
as
referring
an
implicit
terms
to
the
child’s
rights
alone.
even
if
we
were
inclined
to
ignore
the
planed
text
of
the
statute
in
considering
this
theory
we
disagree
that
this
is
idea’s
only
purpose.
it’s
hardly
a
noble
proposition
to
say
that
parents
have
a
recognized
legal
interest
in
the
education
and
upbringing
of
their
child.
without
question
of
parent
of
a
child
with
a
disability
has
a
particular
and
personal
stake
and
so
felling
what
idea
identifies
as
our
national
policy
of
insuring
equality
of
opportunity
for
participation
independent
living
and
economic
self-sufficiency
for
individuals
with
disabilities.
we
find
no
reason
to
read
into
this
statute
an
implicit
rejection
of
the
notion
that
congress
would
accord
parents’
entitlements
concerning
the
education
of
their
children.
but
the
contrary
we
conclude
the
statute
grants
parents
independent
enforceable
rights.
in
light
of
ideas,
text
and
structure
moreover
we
find
that
these
rights
are
not
limited
to
certain
procedural
and
reimbursement
related
matter
but
rather
encompass
the
entitlement
to
a
free
appropriate
education
for
the
parents’
child.
the
parents
may
therefore
bring
suit
under
idea
on
their
own
behalf
in
federal
court
and
then
they
do
so
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney.
in
light
of
our
holding
we
need
not
decide
whether
the
parents
acting
for
sake
could
have
sought
redress
on
behalf
of
their
child.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
the
judgment
and
dissenting
in
part
and
justice
thomas
has
joined
that
opinion.
