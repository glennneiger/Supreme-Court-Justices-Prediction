how
do
you
classify
right
to
reimbursement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
right
to
recover
money,
it's
just
a
remedy,
it's
not
a
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't
we
go
back
to
my
other
question
to
be
sure
i
got
your
point.
the
reimbursement
is
paid
to
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
child
or
the
parents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
reimburse
the
child
for
money
that
his
parents
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would...
what
would
happen
if
the
child
were
deceased
or
incompetent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe,
maybe
these
children
don't.
do
they
set
up
trust
funds
for
these
reimbursements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
guardian
can't
the
funds
that
belong
to
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
