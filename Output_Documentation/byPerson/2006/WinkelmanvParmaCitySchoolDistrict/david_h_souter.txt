justice
david
h.
souter
in
an
instance
in
which
the
money
is
paid
to
the...
the
reimbursement
is
paid
to
the
child,
how
does
the
child
get
the
money
to
the
parents?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
negating
the
award.
i'm...
if
that
theory
is
sound,
if
the
child
is
the
proper
recipient
of
the
reimbursement,
i
presume
that
ultimately
the
reimbursement
is
supposed
to
go
to
the
person
who
paid
the
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
would
be
the
parent.
my
question
is
how
does
the
child
in
that
case
get
the
money
to
the
parent?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
if
the,
if
the
guardian
is
in
a
position
to
convey
the
money
to
himself
in
the
different
capacity
as
the
parent,
then
why
isn't
the
guardian
equally
in
a,
in
a
position
to
be
substituted
for
the
child
in...
in
litigating
the
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
have
it...
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bergeron,
i
have
a
basic
conceptual
problem,
both
with
that
response
and
with
your
larger
argument.
leaving
aside
how
we
should
classify
the
reimbursement
right
or
classify
reimbursement,
you
make
a
broad
distinction
between
the
substantive
right
of
the
child
to
the
free
appropriate
public
education
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
procedural
rights
of
the
parent
in
going
through
the
process
that
ultimately
comes
to
a
conclusion
for
the
child's
benefit.
the
conceptual
problem
i
have
is
that
i
don't
understand
why
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
the
parents
have
procedural
rights
unless
that
procedural...
or
unless
those
procedural
rights
of
the
parents
are
in
aid
of
some
substantive
entitlement
for
the
parents.
we
give
procedural
protection
to
people
in
order
to
vindicate
some
substantive
interest
that
they
can
claim,
and
you're,
in
effect,
splitting
those
two
apart.
you're
saying
one
person
has
a
substantive
right,
the
other
people
have
procedural
right.
and
i
don't
see
conceptually
how
you
can
make
that
split.
and
if
you
don't
make
that
split,
then
it
only
makes
sense
that
the
right
to
the
free
public...
the
free
appropriate
public
education
is,
as
the
statute
in
one
place
seems
to
say,
a
right
of
the
family
group,
the
parents
and
the
child
together,
rather
than
the
right
of
the
child
alone.
so
conceptually,
how
do
you
defend
the
distinction
that
you
make
between
substantive
rights
on
one
person
and
procedural
rights
in
another?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
we
say
that
they
are
the
procedural
rights
of
the
child
and
the
parents
are
simply
stepping
into
the
child's
shoes
to
vindicate
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
you
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
problem?
on
the
analysis
that
you're
coming
up
with,
parents
end
up
without
even
the
procedural
rights,
because
you're
saying
the
only
person
who
can
basically
invoke
a
violation
of
procedural
right
is
the
person
whose
been
denied
the
substantive
right.
the
parent
hasn't
been
denied
the
substantive
right.
therefore,
the
parent
cannot
invoke
even
the
procedural
right
which
ostensibly
on
your
own
analysis,
the
parent
has
been
given.
that
can't
be
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
before
you
direct
me
to
cases--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what's
wrong
with
the
analytical
point
that
i
just
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
instead
of
saying
they're
not
eclipsed,
you're
saying
they
are
totally
blocked
out.
because
you
analysis,
i
thought
was,
in
response
to
my
earlier
objection,
that
the
procedural
right,
in
fact,
can
only
ultimately
be
invoked
for
the
vindication
of
the
substantive
right.
and
because
the
substantive
right
is
the
child's,
not
the
parents,
it
would
follow
that
the
parents
cannot
even
invoke
their
procedural
rights,
and
we
know
that
that
can't
be
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
parent's
procedural
rights
are
not
gone,
then
the
parents
must
be
able
to
invoke
those
procedural
rights
based
on
what
they
claim
to
be
a
denial
of
some
substantive
entitlement.
you're
saying
that's
the
entitlement
of
the
child,
but
if
the
parents
are
going
to
have
any
procedural
right
worth
having,
they've
got
to
invoke
it
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
that
substantive
right;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
why
do
not
the
parents,
when
they
are
claiming
that
they
are
aggrieved,
have
as
much
right
to
make
a
claim
that
goes
to
the
substantive
denial
as
to
the
procedural
denial,
simply
because
the
two
are
inseparable?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bergeron,
on,
one
of
the
points
you
made
on
the
spending
clause
argument,
i
thought,
was
that
if
there
are
lawyers
representing
the
parents,
the
lawyers
are
going
to
screen
out
the
more
frivolous
cases.
if
they
are
not,
more
frivolous
cases
are
going
to
be
brought.
and
there's...
there's
an
intuitive
appeal
to
that
argument.
do
we
have
any...
any
figures
on
the
comparative
numbers
of
frivolous
cases
in
lawyer
representation
and
pro
se
representation
under
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
have
any
first
circuit
numbers--
justice
david
h.
souter
--versus
other
numbers?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
thank
you.
