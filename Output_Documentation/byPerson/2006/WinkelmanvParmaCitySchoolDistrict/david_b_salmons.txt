mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
made
parents
of
children
with
disabilities
parties
in
their
own
right
in
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings
under
the
idea,
and
granted
parents
their
own
rights
under
the
act.
one
of
the
rights
granted
expressly
to
parents
is
the
right
to
seek
reimbursement
for
private
educational
expenses
when
the
parents
believe
the
school
has
failed
to
provide
an
appropriate
education.
that
is
the
claim
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
parents
are
clearly
the
appropriate
party
for
that
claim
because
they're
the
ones
that
have
incurred
the
financial
harm.
when
they
are
reimbursed--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
the
statute
in
section
1412(a)(10)(c)(2),
and
this
is
on
page
6a
of
petitioner's
brief,
expressly
provides
a
right
to
parents
to
seek
reimbursement
for
the...
for
their...
the
educational
expenses
that
they
incur.
and
while
the
parents
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
denial
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
statute
makes
the
claim
the
parent's
claim.
and
there
are
cases,
for
example,
out
of
the
fourth
district,
in
emery,
that
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
even
clear
that
the
child
would
have
standing
to
assert
a
claim
for
reimbursement
when
they're
not
out
of
pocket
any
expenses.
so
we
think
in
a
case
like
this,
this
is
an
easy
case.
we
think
clearly
here
the
parents
are
the
parties.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
that's
not
the
sum
total
of
our
argument,
your
honor.
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
actually
there's
a
relatively
narrow
way
to
decide
this
case
if
the
court
so
chose,
by
focusing
on
the
reimbursement
claim
in
this
case.
our
position
is
that
parents
share
in
the
substantive
right
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education
under
the
act.
and
there
are
two
things
we
would
point
to
in
regard
to
the
definition
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education
that
we
think
makes
this
clear.
and
this
is
in
section
1401
of
the
act
on
pages
2a
and
4a
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
first
is
the
definition
says
that
the
term
free
appropriate
public
education
means
special
education
services
provided,
quote,
without
charge
and
at
no
cost
to
parents.
we
think
clearly
the
free
aspect,
again,
is
first
and
foremost
a
right
of
the
parents,
because
they're
the
ones
that
bear
the
cost.
with
regard
to--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--there's...
that's
correct.
the
definition
begins
on
page
2(a)
"which
says
free
appropriate
public
education
on
section
1401
and
it
says.
"
the
term
free
appropriate
public
education
means
special
education
related
services
that...
and
under
subparagraph
a
have
been
provided
at
public
expense
under
public
supervision
and
direction
and
without
charge...
then
in
subparagraph
29
on
page
4(a)the
term
special
education
is
defined
which
is
again
the
term
from
the
definition
of
free
appropriate
public
education,
is
defined
to
mean
"specially
designed
instructions
at
no
cost
to
parents.
"
and
so
again
the
right
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education
is
defined
expressly
in
part
as
terms
of
the
parents
interest.
we
also
think
that
regards
to
any
question
about
what
is
the
appropriate,
if
you
look
back
again
on
2(a),
subparagraph
d
of
the
definition
of
free
appropriate
public
education,
it
says
that
it
has
to
be
special
education
services
that
are
provided
in
conformity
with
the
individual
education
program
required
under
the
act.
and
now
the
individual
education
program
or
iep
process
is
the
process
by
which
parents
are
given
the
right
to
participate
as
full
members
of
the
iep
team
and
to
have
a
say
in
helping
to
define
what
is
an
appropriate
education
for
the
child.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
rowley,
this
is
the
essential
feature
of
this
act.
the
way
it
works
is
that
congress
did
not
specify
or
flesh
out
a
substantive
standard
for
what
is
appropriate
for
a
child'
instead
it
ensured...
it
mandated,
excuse
me...
that
an
appropriate
education
is
an
education
that
involves
parental
involvement.
and
when
there
is
a
dispute
with
regard
to
whether
the
iep
team
has
adopted
the
right
educational
program
for
the
child,
we
think
that
the
act
makes
parents,
who
again,
who
are
full
members
of
that
team,
when
their
views
are
rejected
as
far
as
what
is
appropriate,
they
are
given
the
procedural
safeguard
of
initiating
a
due
process
hearing.
again
the
act
refers
repeatedly
to--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well
it,
that
is
essentially
our
position
although
i
would
add
that
our
position
is
that
all
of
the
rights
of
the
statute
are
rights
that
are
shared
by
the
parent.
at
least
with
regard
to
the
substantive--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
we
do--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well...
well...
just
because
i
haven't
limited
the
rights
of
the
parents
right
doesn't
mean
that
i
haven't
been
trying
to
make
a
point
about
how
to
interpret
the
statute.
the
statute
we
think
does
not
limit
the
parents'
rights
to
sue
on
behalf
of
their
child
and
on
behalf
of
their
own
rights
under
the
statute.
we
think
the
way
to
think
about
this...
again,
keep
in
mind
that
the
right
to
initiate
a
due
process
hearing
and
the
right
to
seek
review
of
that
in
court,
those
are
rights
that
are
contained
in
section
1415,
which
is
the
procedural
protection,
the
procedural
guarantees
of
the
act.
and
we
think
those
are
rights
that
belong
to
the
parents.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
we
think
the
way--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the...
that...
that's
correct.
the
way
we
look
at
the
question,
your
honor,
is
to
say
it
gives
the
parents
those
rights,
it
gives
the
parents
the
right
to
be
full
members
of
the
iep
team
that
determines
the
appropriate
education
for
that
child.
while
the
school
district
has
the
final
say
as
far
as
the
contents
of
the
iep,
the
parents
as
members
of
that
team
have
the
right
to
initiate
litigation
through
administrative
procedures
and
then
ultimately
in
court,
if
their
view
of
what
is
appropriate
for
their
child
is
rejected
by
the...
by
the...
by
the
iep
team.
and
while,
and
no
doubt--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
right
to
initiate--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
what
i
would
refer
you
to
are
the
many
provisions
of
the
act,
and
you
can
turn
to
pages
16
a
and
17
a
for
example
of
petitioner's
brief
that
has
these,
in
part,
where
the
act
repeatedly
refers
to
the
parents'
due
process
complaint,
the
parents'
due
process
complaint,
known
as
the
parents'
right
to
a
due
process
hearing.
the
2004
amendments
expressly
refer,
define
prevailing
party
to
be
parents.
it
referred
to
the
parents'
cause
of
action--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--they
have
a
right--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--our
way
of
looking
at
the
statute,
your
honor,
says
that
if
they
are
the
ones
that
initiate
the
hearing,
they
file
the
complaint,
they
are
parties
to
that
hearing,
then
when,
when
their
claims
are
denied,
they
are
parties
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it's
the
same
term,
parties
aggrieved,
that
refers
to
the
right
to
an
appeal
in
the
administrative
process
that
refers
to
the
ability
to
initiate
a
civil
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
i...
does
say,
it
does
reference
back,
in
fact
it
references
back
to
the
complaint
that's
filed
to
initiate
the
due
process
hearing.
and
the
parties
are
the
ones
that...
excuse
me,
the
parents
are
the
ones
that
are
referred
to
as
the
ones
filing
those
complaints.
it
is
referred
to
repeatedly
as
the
parents'
complaint
and
the
parents
are...
are
referred
to
as
prevailing
parties
in
the
civil
action.
again
in
the
attorneys
fee
provisions
that
were
added
in
2004,
expressly
refer
to
quote,
"the
parents'
complaint
or
subsequent
cause
of
action.
"
this
is
on
page
24
a
of
petitioner's
brief.
and
it
refers
to
parents
as
a
prevailing
party.
there
are
other
provisions
that
do
so
as
well
and
while
we're
on
the
topic
of
the
2004
amendments...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
