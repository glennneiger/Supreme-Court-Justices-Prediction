mr.
jean-claude
andre
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
asks
the
court
to
decide
to
what
extent
non-lawyer
parents
of
a
child
with
a
disability
may
litigate
an
idea
case
pro
se
in
federal
court.
under
two
distinct
theories,
the
answer
to
that
question
should
be
without
limitation.
but
i
would
like
to
focus
today
on
petitioner's
primary
and
first
theory,
which
is
that
parents
are
real
parties
in
interest
in
idea
suits
regardless
of
the
claims
being
asserted.
under
28
usc
1654,
a
party
has
a
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
statutory
law
to
litigate
their
own
case.
accordingly,
when
a
parent
sues
under
idea,
it
is
our
position
they
are
suing
in
their
own
right
and
are
suing
on
their
own
case.
this
is
particularly
so
because
the
right
to
sue
provision
that
congress
enacted
in
idea
uses
the
broad
phrase
"any
party
aggrieved"
when
it
allows
judicial
review
of
an
adverse
administrative
hearing
officer's
decision.
the
parties
agree
that
it
is
the
underlying
administrative
complaint
or
the
due
process
complaint
that
frames
both
the
claims
that
can
be
brought
eventually
in
court,
and
also
identifies
who
the
parties
are
that
can
appear
in
court.
those
complaint
provisions
in
idea,
and
there
are
eight
of
them
in
all
we
cite
in
footnote
seven
of
our
reply
brief;
all
eight
of
those
provisions
refer
unambiguously
to
the
parents'
complaints.
congress
did
not
describe
this
due
process
complaint
that
starts
the
whole
dispute
process
as
the
child's
complaint,
the
child's
complaint
by
and
through
the
parents,
or
the
parents'
complaint
on
behalf
of
the
child.
accordingly,
when
a
parent
files
that
due
process
complaint,
they
are
the
real
party
in
interest,
and
again,
the
provisions
make
no
distinctions
about
the
kinds
of
claims
that
can
be
brought.
it
shouldn't
matter
that
when
they
get
to
federal
court
that...
or
there
shouldn't
be
any
limitation
on
who
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
federal
court,
or
what
claims
may
be
asserted.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
don't
think
you
would
need
a
reach
a
second
question,
justice
kennedy.
it's
our
position
that
the
remedies
in
an
idea
case
are
co-extensive
and
that
the
rights
are
inseparable.
and
so,
this
case
was
pleaded
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
both
the
parents
and
the
child
be
before
the
court.
but
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
us
on
our
first
and
primary
theory,
we
don't
believe
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
child
listed
as
a
plaintiff
to
a
future
suit,
and
we
imagine
that
on
remand
the
child
might
be
dismissed
from
the
suit.
it's
our
position
that
he's
not
an
indispensable
party.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
clearly
the
relief
primarily
sought
by
my
clients...
in
fact,
if
you
look
just
at
the
relief
section
of
the
complaint
that
my
clients
filed,
which
is
in
joint
appendix,
page
19,
the
only
relief
they
actually
seek
is
reimbursement.
there's
a
number
of
ways--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--of
course,
it's
our
position
that
parents
are
never
acting
as
guardians,
at
least
in
the
legal
sense,
or
lay
representatives
of
a
child
in
a
court
action.
and
so,
therefore,
a
parent
should
be
able
to
assert
any
one
of
the...
a
claim
asserting
violation
of
any
one
of
the
many
rights
conferred
in
the
act.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
correct.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
in...
and
this
could
be
a
very
easy
case
if
the
court
wants
to
look
just
at
the
specific
procedural
violations
that
my
clients
assert
and
also
the
reimbursement
claim
that
they
assert.
but
it's
of
course
our
position
also
that
the
full
bundle
of
rights
can
be
asserted
by
parents.
i
think
maybe
the
best
way
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
that...
to
direct
you
back
to
the
definition
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education
itself,
and
that's
in
1401(9)
and
(29)
in
the
statute.
that
definition
provides
that
a
free
appropriate
public
education
is
one
that's
provided
at
no
cost
to
parents.
so
if
a
school
district
provides
a
free
and
inappropriate
public
education,
then
it's
the
parents'
obligation...
or
not
obligation...
they
have
the
choice
of
whether
to
supplement
the
inappropriate
public
education
with
additional
services,
or
to
replace
the
public
education
with
one
that
provides
an
appropriate
bundle
of
services.
so
i
guess
my
point
is
that
even
in
a
case
where
the
parents
don't
necessarily
seeks
reimbursement,
they
still
are
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
right
to
a
free
appropriate--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--we
also
believe
that
the
parents
have
an
interest
in
the
education
being
appropriate
for...
in
addition
to
the
reason
i
just
explained,
that
they
may
have
to
supplement
education,
but
parents
are
also
the
co-architects
of
the
individualized
educational
program
that
is
eventually...
that
eventually
defines
the
bundle
of
services
that
it
provides
the
child.
and
they're
integral
to
the--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
think
they're
given...
i
haven't
counted
them...
but
i
think
they're
given
10,
12
of
the
15
procedural
rights
outlined
in
the
statute.
and
this
court
explained
in
rowley,
congress
placed
every
bit
as
much
emphasis
on
parental
involvement
in
the
shaping
of
the
individualized
educational
program--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
typically
a
parent
would
file
a
due
process
complaint,
challenging
the
bundle
of
services
offered
by
the
school
district,
and
alleging
a
procedural
violation.
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
a
rare
case
where
a
parent
would,
by
the
time
they
get
to
federal
court,
try
to
be
a
party
aggrieved
is
something
that
they
didn't
exhaust...
that
would
render
the
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
no,
not
at
all,
justice
ginsburg.
congress
sensibly
recognized
that
because
the
process
proceedings
are
run
on
a
state
by
state
basis,
certain
unauthorized
practice
of
law
statutes
or
other
laws
require
prohibiting
counsel
in
administrative
proceedings
might
come
into
play.
so
congress
had
to
make
it
express
in
section
1415(h)(1)
that
any
party
may
appear
in
the
administrative
proceedings
with
or
without
counsel.
in
contrast,
in
federal
court,
there's
already
28
u.s.c.
1654,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
1789
as
part
of
the
judiciary
act.
that
provision
allows
any
party
to
litigate
their
own
case.
so
it
actually
makes
a
lot
of
sense
that
congress
would
have
included
the
express
right
to
proceed
pro
se--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
again,
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
because
they're
parties
aggrieved
by
the
administrative
proceedings,
so
long
as
they
have
exhausted
their
claims.
and
that
this
is
confirmed
in
other
provisions,
for
example,
the
attorneys'
fees
provision
of
the
statute
refers
repeatedly
to
parents
as
a
possible
prevailing
party.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
our
primary
theory
in
this
case
is
not
that
parents
are
seeking
to
represent
their
children
as
lay
advocates
in
court.
our
primary
theory
is
that
a
parent
suing
under
the
statute
is
suing
in
their
own
right.
in
fact,
that's
why
my
clients
pleaded
this
case
with...
as...
with
themselves
on
the
caption,
and
asserted
claims
that
are
their
own,
because
they
believed
that
those
claims
are
their
own,
and
they
believed
they
should
be
able
to
litigate
those
claims
under
section
1654.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
policy
considerations
would
be
relevant
to
the
statutory
construction
question
of
whose
rights
are
being
asserted
in
a
case
like
this.
but
certainly
under
our
second
theory,
the
public
policy
considerations
would
be
appropriate.
it
is
our
position
that
those
public
policy
concerns
about
pro
se
litigants
burdening
the
court,
burdening
opposing
counsel
are
dramatically
outweighed
by
the
fact
that...
by
the
reality
that
two-thirds
of
the
disabled
children
in
the
united
states
come
from
families
that
cannot
afford
counsel--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--two
responses
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
other
regimes,
where
you
have
a
fee-shifting
statute,
the
cases
are
usually
still
brought
by
pro
se
litigants.
here
because
you
are
dealing
with
a
minor
child,
really,
it
is
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
either
bring
the
case
and
you
have
the
potential
to
recover
attorneys'
fees,
or
the
case
doesn't
get
brought
at
all.
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
statistics
cited
in
our
position
and
the
amicus
briefs
from
the
council
of
parent
attorneys
and
advocates,
and
the
autism
society
of
america.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
no,
there
was
not.
and
then
that
brings
me
to
my
last
point,
which
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
a
very
limited
private
special
ed
bar
and
they
cherry-pick
only
the
best
cases.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
all
the
cases
that
are
left
are
frivolous
or
meritless.
there's
a
whole
universe
of
cases
out
there,
some
of
which
may
be
quite
strong,
some
of
which
may
be
on
the
borderline,
and
some
which
may
be
meritless.
but
congress
cannot
have
intended
to
create
this
important
and
robust
substantive
statutory
guarantee
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education,
and
guarantee
all
these
procedural
safeguards,
including
judicial
review
to
enforce
it,
and
then
expect
that
that
right
would
never
be
fulfilled
because--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
actually,
if
i
could
clarify
one
thing.
if
you
look
closely
at
section
1415(h)(1),
it
does
not
provide
that
a
parent
can
represent
their
child
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
it
just
says
that
any
party
may
litigate
that
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
but
that's
also...
our
position
is
they
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
due
process
hearing
as
parties,
in
fact
as
the
kind
of
plaintiff
side
parties.
and
that
is
confirmed
by
the
provisions
that
we
cite
in
footnote
seven
of
our
reply
brief
that
talk
about
the
parents'
complaint.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
we
thought
that...
we
believe
that
congress
thought
of
it
as
the
parents
because
of
all
the
statutory
references
to
the
parents'
complaint.
of
course,
we
don't
take
the
absurd
position
that
the
child
could
not
also
be
a
party
to
those
proceedings.
but
in
any
event,
my
point
was
simply
that
the
express
lesesne
argument
that
some
courts
relied
on
to
suggest
that
congress
consciously
decided
not
to
allow
parental
lay
representation,
i
mean,
that
argument
simply
doesn't
have
a
strong
foundation,
because
the
provision
on
which
that
argument
is
based,
which
is
1415(h)(1),
is
ambiguous
at
best.
and,
in
fact,
could
suggest
just
the
opposite.
i'd
like
to
address
a
point
that
respondents
have
relied
on--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
first
of
all,
parents
already
have
to
get
to
know
the
statute
and
the
applicable
regulations
when
they
bring
these
cases
at
the
administrative
level.
by
the
time
they
get
to
court,
they
are
intimately
familiar
with
the
facts
and
intimately
familiar
with
the
relevant
law.
the
only
thing
that's
different
about
the
court
action
and
the
administrative
proceeding
is
now
you
have
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i'm
not
sure
we
agree,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia.
but
even
if
that's
true,
the
nature
of
idea
court
action,
i
think,
addresses
some
of
the
concern.
these
are
not
pure
record
review
proceedings,
like
in
merit
systems
protection
board
cases,
or
immigration
cases.
but
they
are
quasi
review
proceedings.
and
so
what
we're
advocating
here
is
really
access
to
the
courts.
let
the
parents,
whether
they
are
brilliant
writers
or
they're
not
so
good
at
writing,
let
them
at
least
have
access
to
the
courts,
so
that
will
then...
a
capable
district
judge
can
look
at
the
case
and
decide
whether
the
school
should
have
complied
with
the
statutory
mandates.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
think
that
the
pro
se
parents
are
quite
different
from
pro
se
prisoners.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
respondents'
assertion
that
petitioners
somehow
waived
their
claim
to
reimbursement
by
not
exhausting
it
below.
we
addressed
this
in
our
reply
brief,
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
pages
78
and
88
of
the
joint
appendix,
particularly
page
78,
there
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
reimbursement
in
their
own
right.
on
the
page
153,
that
respondent
refers
to,
i
assume
that
that
point
in
time
we
were
now
on
appeal
to
the
second
tier
of
the
ohio
administrative
proceeding,
and
perhaps
at
that
point
in
time,
monarch
school
was
actually
paying
for
jake's
education
on
a
grant-like
basis,
because
that
was
something
that
happened
in
this
case.
and
that
perhaps
at
that
point
in
time
petitioners
referenced
reimbursement
to
monarch
because
monarch
had
actually
been
expending
the
fund.
but
by
and
large
my
clients
expended
the
funds
to
educate
jake
at
monarch
school,
and
they
certainly
did
exhaust
that
claim
to
reimbursement.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
certainly.
and
i
mean,
i
think
that's
why
congress
included
the
attorneys'
fee
provision
in
2004
that
recognized
that
parents
can
be
prevailing
parties.
and
if
they
prevail
on
establishing
that
a
free
appropriate
public
education
has
not
been
provided,
then
they
can
recover
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
their,
their
right
to
try
to
vindicate
congress's
purposes
at
no
cost
to
them.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
don't
know.
the
legislative
record
is
entirely
silent.
but
one
plausible
inference
could
be,
could
be
reached
based
on
looking
at
the
addition
of
attorney's
fees
provision
and
the
timing
of
the
maroni
decision
in
the
first
circuit.
maroni
came
down
after
the
parental
lay
representation
provision
was
proposed
by
the
senate.
maroni
was
the
first
court
of
appeals
case
to
recognize
that
parents
may
litigate
these
cases
pro
se.
the
way
maroni
did
it
however
was
by
adopting
our
primary
argument
here
today,
which
is
that
parents
possess
the
right
to...
to
sue
in
their
own
name,
as
pro
se
litigants,
not
as
lay
representatives
of
their
children,
and
seek
to
enforce
the
full
bundle
of
rights.
congress
very
well
could
have
looked
at
maroni
and
said
aha,
that's
what
we
intended
all
along;
maroni
got
it
right,
and
then
they
just
put...
congress
just
put
the
thumb
on
the
scale
a
little
bit
by
enacting
the
attorneys
fee
provision
which
made
it
clear
that
parents
can
be,
or
are
the
prevailing
party
if
the
plaintiffs
prevail
in
an
idea
action.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
two...
two
points
about
the
spending
clause.
of
course
we
believe
the
spending
clause
is
totally
inapplicable,
but
i
want
to
respond
to
respondent's
suggest
that
we're
advocating
creation
of
a
new
substantive
right
here.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
think
that
this
court's
spending
clause
jurisprudence
is
concerned
with
providing
clear
notice
to
states
with
respect
to
liability
and
certain
fiscal
obligations.
and
what
respondent
is
complaining
about
here--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--oh,
what
respondent
is
complaining
about
here
is
essentially
a
disparate
impact.
and
this
court
has
never
recognize
a
disparate
impact
claim
under
the
spending
clause.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
absolutely
spending
clause
legislation.
but
we
believe
that
the
clear
notice
concerns
of
the
spending
clause
are
not
even
implicated.
but
that
if
the
clear
notice
concerns
were
implicated,
the
statute
is...
clear.
