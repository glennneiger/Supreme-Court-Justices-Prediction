before
you
do
that,
how
much
of
a
practical
benefit
would
it
be
for
children
with
disabilities
and
their
parents,
if
you
are
successful
here,
in
light
of
the
complexity
of
the
idea
and
the
fact
that
this
is
an
area
where
some
parents
are
going
to
have
difficulty
maintaining
any
kind
of
emotional
detachment
from
the
litigation?
if
parents
can
represent
their...
can...
a
non-lawyer
parent
can
appear
in
court,
isn't
there
a
risk
that
in
some
instances
where
a
lawyer
could
be
found
if
the
parent
made
an
effort
to
do
that,
they're
going
to
be
lured
into
trying
to
provide
the
representation
themselves?
