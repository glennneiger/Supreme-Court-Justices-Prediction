samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
cochran,
are
you
arguing
the
sentencing
in
this
case
violated
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it
didn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment,
then
your
argument
is
based
on
the
sentencing
reform
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can't
say
whether
it
did
or
did
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
was
your
client's
sentence
enhanced
by
any
fact
that
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
the
sixth
amendment
have
to
do
with
the
selection
of
the
sentencing
philosophy
that
is
to
be
imposed?
how
can
there
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation
if
either
the
guidelines
or
our
case
law
says
military
service
is
or
is
not
a
relevant
factor?
i
don't
see
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
anything
that
you
can
get
out
of
the
sixth
amendment.
