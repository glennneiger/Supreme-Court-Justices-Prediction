justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
reconcile
the
language
in
the
prologue
of
(c)
which
says,
the
court
shall
state
the
reasons,
with
(c)(2),
which
says
that
if
the
sentence
is
not
of
the
kind
or
is
outside
the
range
described
in
(a)(4)
of
the
guidelines,
the
court
shall
state
the
specific
reason
for
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
different
from
the
guidelines?
now,
this
seems
to
set
up
some
dichotomy
between
giving
reasons
and
giving
the
specific
reason.
where
does
that
line
fall
in
your
estimation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
i
mean,
you
explain
why
it's
put
in
there,
but
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
difference
between
giving
the
reasons
and
giving
the
specific
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cochran,
i
have
this
concern:
if
we
accept
your
submission
that
the
district
court
should
just
consider
the
guidelines
together
with
everything
else,
give
them
a
presumption
of
validity,
anything
else,
just
something
to
consider,
that
would
presumably
eliminate
any
sixth
amendment
problem
with
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact.
but
the
district
court's
sentence
is
going
to
go
on
appeal.
and
the
appellate
court
in
reviewing
it
for
reasonableness,
let's
assume
in
this
case
the
appellate...
the
appellate
court
says
oh,
no,
this
person
had...
we
find
as
a
matter
of
fact,
given
the
record,
military
service,
you
know,
which
we
think
should
have
been
taken
into
account.
and,
therefore,
we
set
it
aside.
now,
the
next
case
that
comes
up,
which
doesn't
have
the
element
of
military
service,
in
all
other
respects
the
same
as
your
client's
case,
it
comes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
say,
ah,
we
don't
have
that
different
fact
here
and
therefore
we
affirm
the
sentence.
isn't...
in
other
words
isn't
the
finding
of
a
fact
necessary
for
the
process
of
judicial
review,
even
if
it
is
not
made
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
the
district
court's
determination?
he
would
not
get
that
sentence
but
for
this
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
haven't
shown
us
a
way
out
of
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
even
if
you
don't...
don't
establish
thresholds
by
reason
of
the
guideline,
you
are
establishing
thresholds
upon
judicial
review,
guidelines
or
not.
if
the...
if
the
appellate
court
says,
oh,
given
there's
this
fact
in
this
case,
the
sentence
below
was
reasonable,
but
in
the
next
case,
where
that
fact
does
not
exist,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
ah,
the
sentence
is
unreasonable,
in
other
words,
that
fact
is
made
a
necessary
condition
for
giving
the
higher
sentence.
so
you
haven't...
you
haven't
solved
the
problem
of
the,
of
the
apparent
conflict
between...
between
booker
and
the
advisory
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
focusing
on
my
point.
i
concede
that
the
district
court
is
free
as
a
bird...
free
as
a
bird...
but
you
have
appellate
review.
and
the
appellate
court
in
reviewing
for
reasonableness
is
going
to
make
a
particular
fact
determinative
of
whether
this
sentence
can
stand
or
not.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
going
to
be
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
did
incorporate
them
in
that
district
judges
were
free
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
if
indeed
they
found
there
was
some
one
of
these
human
factors
not
considered
by
the
guidelines
which
existed
in
the
particular
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
they
were
systematically
removed
then
all
of
these
other
human
factors
that
you're
complaining
about
were
considered
by
the
guideline
commission
and
were
simply
rejected.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
presumably
cannot
give
weight
to
factors
that
the
commission
decided
should
have
weight.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
to
do
it
unless
he
wants
to
be
sure
of
being
affirmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
some
fact,
not
necessarily
a
particular
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
you've
simply
substituted
stare
decisis
and
the
necessity
of
the
district
court
following
circuit
law
for
the
guidelines.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
guidelines
are
unconstitutional
because
they
make
facts
automatically
determinative,
i
assume
that
would
be
unconstitutional
because
it
makes
facts
automatically
determinative.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
the
jury
determines
the
facts
that
make
them
similar.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
here
is
what
makes
them
similar.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're...
i
mean,
this
is
a
self
fulfilling
prophecy.
you're
saying
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
guidelines,
you're
not
going
to
have
uniformity.
well,
i...
my
goodness.
is
that
consistent
with
the
notion
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
just
inconsistent
with
the
notion
which
i
think
is
correct,
that
the
district
judge
can
simply
disagree
with
the
basic...
basic
reasons
of
the
commission,
can
simply
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the
commission
considers
white
collar
crime,
for
example,
something
that
should
justify
incarceration.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
system
that
you're
describing
any
different
for
mandatory
guidelines
that
are
subject
to
departure
when
the
district
judge
finds
a
significant
reason,
which
was
what
mandatory
guidelines
had?
justice
antonin
scalia
wherein
is
it
different?
