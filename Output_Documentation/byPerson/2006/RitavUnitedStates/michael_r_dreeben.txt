mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
appropriately
applied
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
in
reviewing
the
sentence
imposed
pursuant
to
the
advisory
guidelines
system
that
this
court
announced
in
united
states
versus
booker.
the
guidelines
represent
the
integration
of
the
multiple
purposes
of
sentencing
reflected
in
section
3553(a)
that
the
district
court
is
obligated
to
consider.
the
commission
also
represents
an
expert
body
that
has
considered
the
various
parameters
of
sentencing
and
the
fact
patterns
that
arise
in
the
federal
system
and
has
made
an
effort
over
time
to
arrive
at
an
appropriate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
the
commission
considered
that
factor
and
then
determined
that
it
was
not
generally
appropriate
to
a
sentence
outside
the
guidelines.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
guidelines
specifically
do
not
give
weight
to
it.
they
permit
a
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
booker
the
judge
should
do
that.
that
is
the
difference
between
an
advisory
guidelines
system
and
a
mandatory
guidelines
system.
the
judge
can
give
weight
to
factors
that
the
commission
decided
should
not
have
weight
in
the
sentencing
process.
that
is
the
essence
of
what
it
means
for
the
guidelines--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
can
do
that,
too,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
we're
back,
justice
breyer,
to
a
further
point
even
than
the
first
set
of
guidelines,
because
even
under
the
first
set
of
guidelines
application
of
the
guidelines
was
mandatory
unless
the
court
found
an
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstance
that
wasn't
taken
into
account.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
understand
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
reconciliation
of
this
court's
merits
opinion
in
booker
and
its
remedial
opinion
in
booker
does
dictate
that
the
judge
has
additional
freedom
to
impose
a
sentence
that's
different
from
what's
described
in
the
guidelines.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
between
what
the
job
of
the
district
court
is
and
what
the
job
of
the
appellate
court
is;
and
in
this
case,
the
government
is
arguing
for
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
on
appeal.
once
the
district
judge
has
determined
that
the
guidelines
sentence
aligns
with
his
own
application
of
the
section
3553(a)
factors,
our
submission
here
is
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
generally
presume
that
that
is
a
reasonable
sentence.
the
defendant
of
course
has
the
opportunity,
or
the
government
if
the
government
has
appealed,
to
show
that
that
presumption
is
overcome.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
true
even
if
what
we
were
talking
about
was
a
direction
to
the
district
judge
to
presume
that
he
would
impose
a
guidelines
sentence.
but
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about.
the
district
judge
does
not
operate
and
does
not
have
to
operate
under
the
position
that
we're
arguing
for
with
a
presumption
that
the
judge
will
impose
a
guidelines
sentence
unless
persuaded
otherwise.
the
judge's
obligation
is
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
would
think
that
what
the
judge
wants
to
do
is
be
sure
that
he's
complied
with
his
statutory
obligations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
are.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
think
what
it
reflects
at
the
appellate
level
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
enters
the
case
with
an
attitude
that,
our
job
is
to
decide
whether
what
the
district
judge
did
was
reasonable.
we
can
operate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
think
that
it's
not
so
different
from
the
court
of
appeals
saying
we
can
enter
this
case
feeling
pretty
confident
that
we
can
affirm
a
guidelines
sentence
unless
the
person
who
challenges
that
shows
us
a
good
reason
otherwise.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
latter,
justice
souter.
and
i
think
that
in
that
regard
there
is
a
range
of
reasonable
sentences
that
could
be
imposed
based
on
a
given
set
of
facts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
of
appeals
can
uphold
both
of
them
if
it
concludes
that
the
actual
sentence
that's
imposed
is
reasonable.
and
in
the
second
case
that
the
court
is
going
to
hear
today
the
government
argues
for
a
proportionality
principle
that
should
govern
the
review
of
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you're
right,
justice
souter,
and
i
can't
say
that
that
would
be
the
first
choice
of
the
congress
that
enacted
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is,
and
it's
not
the
first
choice
of
the
government,
either.
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
something
of
an
inevitability
once
this
court
has
declared
that
mandatory
guidelines
are
impermissible
under
the
constitution
if
judicial
factfinding--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
probably
does
not,
justice
alito.
but
what
happened
in
the
first
part
of
booker
is
that
the
court
declared
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory
and
advice.
it's
advice
that
can
be
accepted
or
rejected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
try
to
address
that
and
try
to
address
justice
alito's
point
about
the
question
of
how
much
sentencing
philosophy
can
be
decreed
by
the
sentencing
commission
or
congress
before
a
sixth
amendment
problem
arises.
as
i
understand
this
court's
sequence
of
opinions
from
apprendi
leading
up
to
the
most
recent
decision
in
cunningham,
if
the
law
establishes
a
level
of
punishment
that
may
be
imposed
based
on
the
facts
found
by
the
jury
and
says
to
the
judge,
judge,
you
may
not
go
above
it
unless
you
find
a
particular
fact,
that
fact
is
subject
to
the
sixth
amendment
rule
that
the
court
has
announced
and
must
be
found
by
a
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
any
fact
at
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
what
the
court
has
said,
although
i
understand
that
to
mean
facts
pertaining
to
the
offense
and
the
offender,
not
facts
about
the
world
such
as
the
prevalence
of
crime.
now,
what
that
leads
me
to
conclude
is
that
in
order
to
escape
the
bright
line
rule
that's
been
announced
in
this
sequence
of
cases,
including
booker
itself
and
most
recently
cunningham,
a
judge
must
be
able
to
look
at
the
set
of
facts
that
the
jury
found,
determine
what
level
of
punishment
would
be
advised
by,
say,
a
guidelines
system,
and
not
be
bound
to
impose
that
level
of
punishment
if
the
judge
feels
that
a
different
level
of
punishment
is
appropriate.
if
that
is
a
correct
understanding
of
what
this
court
has
held,
it
necessarily
implies
that
a
judge
does
have
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
in
an
advisory
guidelines
system
to
disagree
with
what
the
sentencing
commission
has
found,
give
the
judge's
reasons,
and
then
is
subject
to
appellate
review
for
the
reasonableness
of
that
explanation
and,
the
government
submits,
subject
to
a
proportionality
principle,
so
that
the
sentence
that's
imposed
outside
the
guidelines
is
a
reasonable
one
and
not
an
arbitrary
one.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that
and
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
have
the
legal
freedom
to
be
able
to
disagree
with
what
the
sentencing
commission
said,
that
would
be
very
good
from
the
government's
perspective.
but
as
i
understand
the
complementary
rules
that
are
established
by
booker,
what
an
advisory
guidelines
system
requires
is
that
the
guidelines
be
treated
as
advice
rather
than
mandate.
so
while
the
guidelines
have
determined
that
military
service
is
not
ordinarily
relevant
to
the
level
of
punishment,
a
judge
may
determine
in
a
particular
case
that
he
disagrees.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
correct
the
judge
on
a
mistaken
apprehension
of
law,
which
is
that
the
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
the
circumstance,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
you
put
your
finger
on
two
different
types
of
review.
in
the
circumstance
in
which
a
district
judge
operates
with
what
i'll
call
legal
blinders
on
that
prevent
him
from
complying
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
hoping
that
it's
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said,
because
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
told
the
judge
you're
obligated
to
impose
a
guideline
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
judges
are
still
obligated
to
comply
with
3553(a),
which
requires
them
to
exercise
discretion.
now
if
a
judge
decides
i
might
as
a
personal
matter
if
i
were
writing
the
guidelines
write
them
differently,
and
i
might
give
great
weight
to
military
service,
but
one
of
the
things
that
i'm
required
to
do
under
section
3553(a)
is
to
consider
the
need
to
avoid
unwarranted
disparity
between
defendants
who
have
been
convicted
of
similar
criminal
conduct
and
have
similar
records.
and
therefore,
i
am
going
to
moderate
my
own
personal
preference
and
not
impose
a
significant
outside
the
range
sentence,
in
order
to
ensure
that
i
fully
have
taken
into
account
the
fact
that
we
are
in
a
federal
system
with
674
federal
district
judges,
and
we
cannot
have
all
our
own
personal
guidelines
systems.
now
if
a
judge
does
that,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
i
think
that
judge
has
actually
complied
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
sentence
that
varies
from
what
other
judges
would
do
and
a
sentence
that
is
unreasonable.
if
the
sentence
that
is
different
from
what
other
judges
would
do
is
not
supported
by
a
cogent
and
coherent
explanation,
and
it
is
unduly
productive
of
disparity
because,
say,
it
takes
a
guidelines
range
like
this
one,
of
33
months
to
41
months,
and
the
judge
says
in
my
view
military
service
means
that
this
defendant
gets
probation.
or
to
take
an
example
that's
on
the
other
side,
suppose
that
the
judge
says
this
defendant
actually
didn't
get
any
extra
credit
in
his
criminal
history
for
his
prior
crime,
but
he
has
been
convicted
before
of
lying
to
the
government
about
his
gun
charges.
i'm
now
going
to
take
him
up
to
the
statutory
maximum
or
near
it
and
give
him
eight
years.
i
think
in
those
circumstances
a
court
of
appeals
can
and
should
say,
hold
on,
this
is
a
view
that
the
district
judge
is
entitled
to
take
on
the
merits.
he's
entitled
to
give
greater
weight
to
that
factor,
whether
it's
aggravating
or
mitigating,
than
what
the
guidelines
did,
but
not
to
this
extent,
or
we're
going
to
be
left
with
a
system
in
which
disuniformity
is
the
main
principle.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
to
me
sounds
identical
to
the
system
that
pre-existed
booker's
holding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court
hasn't
specifically
addressed--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
answer
the
question
yes
and
say
that
courts
of
appeals
can
establish
their
own
sub-legal
rules
as--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
if
do
you
that,
what
you
have
is
each
court
of
appeals
functioning
as
a
sentencing
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
assume
too
under
the
rationale--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
understand
this
dialogue.
and
what
we
have--
[laughter]
i
too
have
been
with
the
dissenters
in
these
cases,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
for
here
is
a
set
of
principles
that
appellate
courts
can
apply
and
that
district
courts
can
look
to
when
sentencing,
that
will
come
as
close
as
is
reasonably
possible
to
achieving
congress's
aims
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
without
crossing
over
the
bright
line
rule
that
this
court
has
announced--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
arguing
for
any
proposition
that
i
think
would
raise
concern.
i
do
think
that
a
general
tenet
of
abuse
of
discretion
review
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
affirm
a
result
that
it
would
not
necessarily
have
reached
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
problematic
with
what
this
district
judge
did.
as
your
honor
noted,
this
was
a
sentence
that
was
imposed
after
a
lengthy
sentencing
hearing
in
which
the
court
engaged
in
a
dialogue
with
defense
counsel
about
the
three
bases
and
the
exclusive
bases
on
which
defense
counsel
asked
for
a
downward
departure.
the
judge
at
least
four
times
in
this
transcript
brought
up
section
3553,
recognizing
that
the
judge
was
well
aware
of
his
obligation
to
imply
the
purposes
of
sentencing
and
the
factors
that
were
presented
to
him.
now
he
did
that
and
he
made
comments
along
the
way
that
indicate
why
he
did
not
find
physical
condition,
military
service,
or
asserted
vulnerability
in
prison
to
be
reasons
that
would
justify
giving
this
defendant
a
lower
sentence.
and
in
his
ultimate
explanation,
though
it
is
brief,
he
pointed
to
two
of
the
section
3553
factors
explicitly.
he
pointed
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
and
he
pointed
to
the
need
for
public
protection.
now
if
you
look
at
the
legal
obligations
that
the
judge
had
under
section
3553(c)
to
explain
himself,
the
statute
actually
sets
up
a
hierarchy
of
three
different
levels
of
explanation.
first,
in
any
case
the
judge
is
to
state
the
reasons
for
the
sentence.
second,
if
the
sentencing
range
is
greater
than
24
months,
the
judge
is
supposed
to
explain
the
particular
reason
for
giving
a
sentence
at
one
end
or
another
end
of
the
range.
and
finally,
if
the
sentence
is
outside
the
range,
the
judge
is
to
give
the
specific
reason
for
a
sentence
outside
the
range.
that
statutory
framework
makes
it
entirely
plausible
to
say
that
if
a
judge
imposes
a
guideline
sentence
and
explains,
i
see
no
reason
not
to
impose
a
guideline
sentence,
he
has
met
his
burden
of
explanation
without
having
to
respond
literally
and
in
sequence
to
each
argument
that
the
defendant
has
made.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
stevens,
our
position
is
more
complicated
than
that,
because
within
a
guidelines
range
if
a
sentence
is
imposed,
the
government--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
sentences
that
are
outside
the
guidelines
range
are
more
likely
to
be
the
cause
of
or
a
source
of
unwarranted
disparity
than
a
sentence
within
the
range.
and
that
is
why
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
interested
in
fulfilling
what
booker
said
the
role
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
which
is
to
iron
out
sentencing
differences,
there
is
more
reason
for
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
isn't
any
one
correct
sentence
usually.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
there
are
more
legal
elements
that
go
into
sentencing
and
sentencing
review
than
just
those
that
you've
named,
justice
stevens.
section
3553(a)
itself,
which
is
the
guidepost
for
review,
mandates
that
the
district
court
consider
the
guidelines,
consider
the
policy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
happens
when
a
sentence
is
imposed
outside
the
range
is
that
there
is
a
greater
risk
of
infringing
the
main
purpose
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
was
to
avoid
unwarranted
disparities;
and
in
contrast
to
a
sentence
within
the
range
which
does
not
merely
run
that
risk
to
the
same
degree,
a
sentence
outside
the
range
may
well.
it's
different
from
what
the
sentencing
commission
with
its
expertise
and
its
experience
has
recommended
as
the
appropriate
sentence,
given
those
facts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
wouldn't
put
it
as
strongly
as
that,
justice
scalia.
what
i
would
say
is
that
the
further
that
a
sentence
diverges
from
the
guidelines
range,
the
greater
the
possibility
of
unwarranted
disparity;
and
as
a
result
of
that,
a
court
of
appeals
should
look
more
critically
at
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
gave
and
ensure
that
the
constellation
of
reasons
and
facts
that's
presented
is
not
so
likely
to
be
a
disproportionate
sentence
than--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
justice
scalia,
reasonableness
review
connotes
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
review
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
gave
for
that
disagreement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does
for
an
out
of
range
sentence,
justice
souter.
i
think
that
for
a
sentence
within
the
range,
the
judge's
statement
that
i
have
considered
the
guidelines
range
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
does
explain
why
that
judge
has
given
the
sentence
that
he's
given.
it's
consistent
with
the
statute
and
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution.
now
when--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
distinction
between
them
but
i
think
they
are
complementary
rules
and
in
the
next
case
the
government
will
argue
for
a
presumption
that
is
precisely
what
you
have
articulated,
justice
souter.
a
greater
and
more
extensive
and
more
persuasive
explanation
is
needed
the
further
that
you
go
from
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
wouldn't
be
identical
but
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
sentence
within
the
guidelines
can
be
unreasonable
if
there
is
a
compelling
case
for
a
sentence
outside
the
range
because
the
guidelines
simply
don't
fit
in
that
circumstance.
the
sentencing
commission
itself
recognized
that
the
guidelines
were
generalizations;
they
carved
out
a
heartland
in
the
language
of
the
sentencing
commission's
first
set
of
guidelines,
and
that
there
will
be
circumstances
that
would
justify
different
sentences.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia.
it
is
quite--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
different
precisely
on
the
area
that,
that
you
yourself
articulated.
the
judge
can
disagree
with
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
determine
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
the
jury
found,
the
judge
would
impose
a
different
sentence,
and
that
conclusion
is
then
subject
for
reasonableness
review
and
we
submit
based
on
a
proportionality
principle.
