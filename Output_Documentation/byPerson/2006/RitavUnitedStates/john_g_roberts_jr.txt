chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-5754,
rita
versus
united
states.
mr.
cochran.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
guidelines
are
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
matter
what
judge
did
in
other
cases?
i
mean,
if
we
look
on
the
day
before
he
said,
well,
the
guidelines
say
this,
but
i
think
this
case
is
different,
so
i'm
going
to
depart,
and
the
day
after
he
says
i
know
what
the
guidelines
are,
but
i'm
going
to
impose
a
higher
sentence?
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
he's...
when
he
says
i
looked
at
the
guidelines
and
i
think
they're
appropriate,
that
he's
considering
himself
bound
by
something
that
he
may
or
may
not
agree
with,
as
opposed
to
what
he
said?
which
is,
well,
i
cannot
find
that
they're
inappropriate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
if
there
weren't
guidelines
at
all,
and
the
district
court
said
maybe,
you
know,
it's
new,
i
want
to
see
what
other
judges
have
done;
he
presses
a
button
on
the
computer,
give
me
what
the
sentences
were
looking
at
these
facts,
and
finds
out
in
the
last
100
cases,
this
is
what
the
sentence
was.
and
he
says
this
seems
to
me
no
different
than
those
and
that's
the
sentence
i'm
going
to
impose.
is
there
any
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
well,
he
looks
at
all
the
individual
factors
and
he
says
they
seem
not
terribly
different
from
these
100
other
cases
and
the
range
in
those
100
other
cases
was,
you
know,
5
to
7
years,
and
so
i'm
going
to
give
him
5
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
different
than
the...
how
is
that
different
than
looking
at
the
guidelines,
which
did
that
in
a
much
more
comprehensive
way,
and
saying,
i
don't
see
anything
different
in
this
case
from
the
normal
guidelines
case
and
so
i'm
going
to
impose
that
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you...
if
you
have
that,
two
criminals,
criminal
defendants,
with
the
same
identical
background
and
everything
else,
one
judge
says,
i
think
military
service
should
be
taken
into
account,
so
i'm
going
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
by
3
years.
the
judge
next
door
says,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
taken
into
account
so
i'm
going
to
impose
the
guideline
sentence.
both
cases
are
appealed.
they're
consolidated
for
argument.
what
is
the
court
of
appeals
supposed
to
do?
uphold
both
of
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
does
that?
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
we've
got
10
district
judges
in
this
circuit,
nine
of
them
do
not
take
military
service
into
account,
one
does,
and
we
think
that's
inequitable,
doesn't
serve
the
interest
in
uniformity.
and
so
even
though
that
one
judge
says
in
the
exercise
of
my
discretion
i'm
going
to
depart,
we're
going
to
reverse
that
as
unreasonable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
terribly
different
it
is
than
the
normal
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
i
mean,
you
don't
even
need
two
judges
in
my
earlier
question.
let's
say
you
have
the
same
judge,
and
for
three
weeks
every
criminal
defendant
who
comes
before
him
he
says,
i
think
if
you
have
military
service,
you
should
get
a
reduction.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
says,
i
see
you
have
military
service,
but
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
reduction.
i
mean,
is
he
bound
by
some
abuse
of
discretion
standard
to
be
a
little
bit
consistent?
and
if
that's
the
only
type
of
appellate
review
we're
talking
about,
to
ensure
some
degree
of
consistency
in
how
similar
individuals
are
treated
in
similar
cases,
i
don't
see
that
it
raises
any
concern.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
presumably
the
further
the
facts
suggest
that
you
ought
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
range?
if
you've
got
a
submission
here
18
compelling
reasons,
you
shouldn't
follow
the
guidelines,
and
you
get
one
sentence
from
the
district
court
saying...
you
know...
i
followed
the
guidelines,
presumably
that
would
be
the
same
as
a
significant
departure
without
further
justification?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
cochran,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cochran,
you've
started
out
by
saying
there
were
two
places
in
the
record
that
you
thought
showed
the
judge
was
bound
by
the
guidelines.
49,
what
was
the
other
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
the
one...
oh,
that
point?
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cochran.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-5754,
rita
versus
united
states.
