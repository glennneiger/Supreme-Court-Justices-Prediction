justice
david
h.
souter
but
are
you
saying
now
that
that
distinction
should
be
ignored?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
want
all
the
reasons
to
be
specific.
i
mean,
i
understand
your
argument.
but
if
we
accept
that
argument,
then
the
distinction
between
reason
and
specific
reason
basically
is
going
to
be
a
matter
of
history,
and
perhaps
it
should
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
unless
there
is
a
way
to
calibrate
the
strength
of
the
presumption,
there's
no
clear
way
to
distinguish
the
presumption
from
the
mandate.
the
mandate
is
gone.
you
say
yes,
they
consider
other
things.
but
unless
we
can
calibrate
the
presumption
in
some
way
that
says,
you
know,
a
mandate
was
force
60
and
a
presumption
is
a
force
40,
something
like
that,
there's
no
way
to
tell
the
two
apart
in
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
your
view...
on
your
view,
is
the
appellate
court
engaging
in
some
kind
of
de
novo
review
or
is
the
appellate
court
supposed
to
engage
in
a
review
that
it
will
disturb
the
sentence
only
if
it
is
shown
to
be
unreasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
reasonable
is...
is
not
merely
a
sort
of
number
within
a
spectrum.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
reasonable
is
a
function
in
part
of
the
reasons
that
are
given.
and
in
the
chief
justice's
view,
two
diametrically
opposed
reasons
are
given
for
two
different
sentences.
does
the,
does
the
appellate
court
in
his
example
say,
well,
i
think
reasonable
people
could
go
either
way
on
that,
so
however
it
comes
out
it's
fine
on
appellate
review?
isn't
that
what
the
court
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
affirm
both
sentences,
other
things
being
equal?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
clear
that
it
would
have
been
the
last
choice
of
the
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
doesn't
your
presumption
argument
come
down
to
an
argument
for
a
sufficiently
comprehensive
statement
of
reasons,
with
a
more
extensive
statement
required
the
further
the
court
gets
from
the
guidelines?
isn't
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there...
may
i
interrupt
you?
because
your
time
is
getting
short.
is
there
a
difference
between
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
to
the
guidelines
on
the
one
hand
and
a
rule
that
says
the
further
you
get
from
them,
you
can
get
as
far
as
you
want
to,
but
the
further
you
get
from
them,
the
more
extensive
your
explanation
has
to
be?
is
there
a
distinction
between
those
two,
two
rules?
