justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
you
say
that,
given
that
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
that
military
record
was
brought
out,
his
physical
ailments
were
brought
out,
his
activity
in
law
enforcement,
all
that
was
brought
out?
and
indeed,
the
judge
was
assisting
the
defense
attorney
to
make
the
case
clearer
when
it
was
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
would
be,
mr.
cochran,
that
the
obligation
to
be
even-handed
would
have
to...
that
the
trial
judge
would
also
have
to
go
through...
now
this
defendant
maintained
his
innocence.
he
didn't
express
any
remorse.
he
accused
a
government
agent
of
perjury.
all
that,
he
would
have
to
take
into
account,
just
as
specifically?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
what
the
government
pressed
at
the
sentencing
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
point
that
justice
breyer
made
that
these
other
factors
have
been
taken
into
account
by
the
sentencing
commission
because
congress
told
them
to
consider
those
same
factors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
may
i
ask
you,
please,
to
address
a
point
that
mr.
cochran
raised?
i
think
you
were
very
helpful
in
saying
this
presumption
for
the
guidelines
is
how
the
court
of
appeals
evaluates
a
district
court
sentence,
that
there
is
no
presumption
that
binds
the
district
judge.
but
one
of
the
main
points
that
mr.
cochran
made
in
his
presentation
was
the
district
judge
has
to
give
reasons.
he...
this
was
just
a
summary
paragraph
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
hearing.
he
has
to
respond
to
what
defendant
presented.
he
has
to
respond
to
what
the
government
presented.
there
is
an
obligation
stemming
from
subpart
(c)
to
give
reasons,
and
that's
what
he
saw
as
the
principal
flaw
in
this
sentence,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
used.
reasons
weren't
given
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the,
the
judge
also
pointed
out
that
the
jury
made
certain
findings
and
he
thought
he
was
bound
by
them;
that
is,
the
defendant
protested
his
innocence,
and
the
jury
had
found
him
guilty
of
false
statements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
judge
was
bound
by
those.
