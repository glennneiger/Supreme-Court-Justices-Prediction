justice
anthony
m.

where...
i'm
looking
at
that.
it
says
shall
consider.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
your
page
cite?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
district
court
says
i
give
these
following...
i've
considered
these
following
specific
factors.
but
in
my
view,
the
consistency
and
nationwide
uniformity
that
the
guidelines
strive
to
achieve
is
of
great
importance;
and
for
that
reason,
i'm
following
the
guidelines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
an
inappropriate
judgment
for
the
district
court
to
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
the
end
all.
suppose
the
district
judge
said
i
think
this
is
of
great
importance.
you
don't
think
that
the
booker
opinion...
or
do
you
think
the
booker
opinion
rejected
uniformity
and
consistency
as
an
important
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
say
it
is
an
initial
benchmark?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
benchmarks
are
bad.
presumption
is
bad.
great
weight,
that's
bad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
justice
souter's
question,
but
i
have
this
concern,
and
i
thought
it
was
his
concern
as
well.
at
the
appellate
level,
is
the
presumption
something
that
can
only
be
overcome
by
a
clear
and
convincing
showing
or
is
it
just
an
initial
benchmark?
we're
playing
with
standards
and
words
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
we
talk
about
presumptions
at
the
appellate
level,
that's
actually
a
little
strange
in
any
event.
you
usually
talk
about
presumptions
as
assisting
us
in
finding
a
fact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
write
that
this
is
an
additive
thing?
