justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
know,
you
don't
get
a
summary
judgment
case
all
the
time.
i
used
to
get
them,
and
the
district
court
would
hear
all
the
arguments
and
write
down
the
word
denied.
does
that
mean
he
didn't
consider
the
arguments?
that's
a
very
common
thing.
here
we
have
a
district
judge,
he
hears
all
the
arguments.
the
attorneys
brought
it
out.
it's
in
the
file.
he
reads
the
presentence
report.
it's
all
there,
and
the
judge
says,
on
balance,
i'm
going
to
go
apply
the
guidelines.
so
how
can
you
say
he
didn't
consider
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
doesn't
in
a
summary
judgment
case
either.
i
mean,
i've
had
quite
a
few
of
them,
i
used
to,
i
think,
where
they
just
wrote
denied.
that
was
the
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
he
says
the
reasons
are
these.
i
think
that
the
guidelines
sentence
is
a
reasonable
sentence.
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
what
in
the
statute
or
the
law
or
the
constitution
says
that
a
district
judge,
although
it
might
be
good
form
in
a
difficult
case
to
write
more,
but
i've
often
written
opinions
where
i
say,
and
the
remaining
arguments
we
feel
are
not
sufficient
to
change
the
result.
that
means
i
don't
think
they're
that
great
an
argument,
and
i
don't
answer
every
single
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
in
the
law
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
isn't
sufficient,
in
your
view,
that
the
judge
just
says,
the
reason
i
imposed
this
sentence
is
that's
the
guideline
sentence,
and
i
think
in
this
circumstance
it's
reasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
these
other
factors
that
have
been
brought
out,
while
they're
serious
factors,
i
don't
think
they're
enough
to
warrant
a
different
sentence.
suppose
he
adds
those
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
worried
about
basically
is,
i
don't
think
in
the
law
there's
a
special
category
that
requires
a
judge
to
give
special
reasons
in
a
guideline
case.
i
think
it's
the
same
as
any
other
matter.
judges
do
normally
give
reasons.
and
i'd
worry
a
bit
about
creating
a
special
situation
where
district
judges
have
to
do
something
unusual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
get
where
you're
going.
can
i
say
this
in
an
opinion,
would
this
satisfy
you?
and
of
course,
like
any
other
matter,
judges
do
normally
give
reasons.
they
do
normally
reject
arguments
with
reasons,
and
it's
the
same
here.
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
question
ultimately
is,
does
it
violate
the
sixth
amendment
to
say
that
we
have
a
presumption
there,
a
sentence
is
in
the
guidelines
as
a
reasonable...
if
you're
an
appellate
court
judge.
and
you
think
it
does
violate
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
guess
the
argument
of
the
other
side,
which
i
would
like
you
to
address,
is
that,
in
which
there...
we
didn't
think
it
violated
the
of
sixth
amendment
if
the
district
judge
simple
applied
3553...
uh,
3553(a).
and
of
course,
3553(a)
includes
all
of
these
things
that
go
into
the
guidelines;
it
make
a
big
point
of
that
in
3553(a).
so
why...
why
couldn't
you
say,
you
know,
all
these
factors
are
taken
into
account
by
the
commission?
they
start
with
an
effort
to
apply
them
in
typical
cases.
this
is
their
judgment
in
typical
cases.
so
it
is
entitled
to
some
kind
of
weight;
and...
at
least
in
a
typical
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
not
consulting
them.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
how
much
weight
can
a
judge
reading
this
give
them
without
violating
the
sixth
amendment?
all
i'm
trying
to
do
here
is
not
whether
the
guidelines
are
good,
bad,
or
indifferent.
congress
wanted
to
apply
them.
we
excised
the
mandatory
to
comply
with
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
what
else
do
we
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
sixth
amendment?
because
i
would
think
unless
we
have
to
do
something
else,
we
shouldn't
do
it,
because
congress
wanted
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
separate
things
there.
the
general
aims
of
sentencing,
the
four
basic
aims
of
sentencing,
i
believe
the
commission
certainly
took
into
account.
a
separate
thing
was
the
rule
that
said
you
can
depart
only
for
a
matter
that
has
not
been
fully
considered
by
the
guidelines.
and
there
the
original
version,
i
believe,
said
that
we've
considered
nothing
thoroughly.
except
for
certain
specific
matters
that
had
been
mentioned
like
age,
race,
and
we'll
refer
to
statutorily.
now,
that
is
what
you're
thinking
of?
i
mean,
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
of,
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
to
what
your
present
point
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
because
when
they
looked
at
all
of
the
literature,
they
explained
it,
the
rehabilitative
purpose
was
not
that
it
wasn't
taken
into
account,
it
was
there
was
a
consensus
among
experts
that
there
isn't
much
you
can
do
about
it.
that's
different
from
not
taking
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
we
back
to
the
original
version,
which
i'll
read
what
it
says.
it
says:
"with
a
few
specific
exceptions...
race,
sex,
national
origin,
creed,
religion,
socioeconomic
status...
with
those
exceptions,
the
commission
does
not
intend
to
limit
the
kinds
of
factors,
whether
or
not
mentioned
anywhere
else
in
the
guidelines,
that
could
constitute
grounds
for
departure
in
an
unusual
case.
"
that's
what
it
said.
apply
the
guidelines
in
the
heartland.
if
it's
not
the
heartland,
depart.
now,
what
i
wonder
is
are
we
not
back
under
your
theory
of
it
just
to
where
we
were
when
it
started
out,
before
the
commission
started
ruling
all
these
things
out
and
began
to
make
all
its...
the
judge
could
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
said
we
took
nothing
into
account
and
therefore
any
circumstance
that
makes
the
case
unusual
would
be
in
principle
a
ground
for
an
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
more
than
that
is
necessary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
could
do
this:
he
could
set
aside
the
guideline
on
the
theory
that
the
guideline
itself
is
unreasonable,
that
is
it
doesn't
properly
take
account
of
sentencing.
but
suppose
he
doesn't
do
that.
then,
if
you
take
your
view
that
there's
a
presumption
in
its
favor
and
if
it
is
the
normal
case,
not
an
unusual
case
in
any
respect,
how
can
he
not
apply
the
guideline?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
booker
says
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
come
close
to
what
congress
wanted
but
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
what
i
think
we're
talking
about
now...
i
think...
i
mean,
you
sort
of
shed
some...
you
clarified
something
very
well
for
me,
which
is
that
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
district
judge
applies
the
guidelines
sentence,
and
then
what's
the
attitude
of
the
court
on
appeal,
and
the
attitude
is
going
to
be,
well,
the
sentencing
commission
thinks
it's
okay,
the
judge
thinks
it's
okay,
okay,
you
have
to...
you
better
show
me
a
good
reason
to
think
to
the
contrary.
fine.
but
the
interesting
problem
is
the
problem
of
the
next
case
which
you're
now
talking
about,
is,
well,
what
happens
if
the
district
judge
and
when
should
be
the
district
judge
and
how
free
should
the
district
judge
feel
he
is
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
sentence
even
if
it's
not
an
unusual
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
that
complicated.
all
that
happens
is
the
court
of
appeals
says,
look,
in
the
case
of
bank
robberies
we've
discovered
about
33
percent
of
the
defendants
in
the
typical
case
have
been
in
the
army.
and
therefore,
we
think
that
just
ordinary
armed
services
is
not
a
reason,
ordinary
armed...
services
in
the
military
is
not
a
reason
for
a
diminished
sentence.
that's
all,
period.
or
they
can
say
it
the
other
way,
the
absence
of
a
military
service
is
a
reason
for
having
the
higher
sentence,
put
it
any
way
you
want.
and
by
the
way,
district
judge,
if
you
disagree
with
that,
we're
going
to
reverse
you
because
we
think
it's
unreasonable.
okay.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
did.
but
is
there
anything
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
forbids
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
you
think?
because
i
would
think
that
if
you're
going
to
answer
that
question
yes,
you
are
saying
that
not
even
the
court
of
appeals
can
try
to
assure
a
degree
of
fairness
among
different
defendants
in
respect
to
sentencing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
sub-legal
rules.
what
it's
called
is
precedent.
what
you
do
is
you
decide
a
case
and
you
decide
this
is
unfair,
and
then
the
thing
that
as
a
similar
case
comes
along,
is
you
decide
it
the
same
way.
and
if
a
district
judge
doesn't
follow
that,
you
reverse
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
in
other
words,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prevents
the
courts
themselves
from
trying
to
assure
that
sentences
who
are...
that
individuals
who
are
in
similar
positions,
commit
similar
crimes,
will
be
treated
in
similar
ways.
that
to
me
is
possible,
but
of
course
i've
been
in
dissent
in
these
cases.
but
it
seems
to
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we're
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
our
decision
in
united
states
versus
booker,
the
federal
court
appeals
or
to
review
federal
sentences
and
set
aside
those
that
they
find
unreasonable.
that’s
basically
the
standard.
several
circuits
have
held
that
when
they
do
that
they
should
presume
that
a
sentence
that
the
district
judge
imposed
within
the
properly
calculated
the
united
states
sentencing
guideline
range,
they
should
assume
that
within
guideline
range
sentence
is
a
reasonable
sentence
so
it’s
okay.
now
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
such
a
presumption
is
legally
permissible
and
we
conclude
that
it
is.
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
reflects
the
fact
that
by
the
time
an
appeals
court
is
considering
a
within
guideline
sentence
on
review.
both
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
sentencing
commission
will
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
about
the
proper
sentence
in
that
particular
case.
that
doubled
determination
significantly
increases
the
likelihood
that
the
sentence
is
a
reasonable
one.
moreover,
the
sentencing
statute
envisions
that
both
the
sentencing
judge
and
the
commission
will
carryout
the
same
basic
statutory
objectives.
the
judge
will
do
that
by
focusing
on
the
case
at
hand.
the
commission
will
do
that
by
looking
at
large
numbers
of
sentences
in
similar
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
reasonableness
presumptions
simply
recognizes
that
real
world
circumstance
when
judges’
discretionary
decision
is
the
same
as
the
commission’s
view
of
the
appropriate
sentence
in
that
kind
of
case
it
is
probable
that
the
sentence
is
reasonable.
we
add
that
in
our
view
the
appellate
court’s
use
of
the
presumption
ordinarily
does
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
we
add
further
that
the
sentencing
judge
in
this
case
explained
his
reasons
for
his
choice
of
sentence
insufficient
detail
and
we
also
find
that
the
sentencing
judge
here
adequately
explained
to
the
defendant
that
he
might
apply
a
guideline
sentence,
he
might
depart
within
the
departure
framework
that
the
guidelines
create
or
he
could
treat
the
guidelines
as
advisory
and
decide
not
to
apply
them
at
all.
for
all
these
reasons
and
for
other
reasons
that
we
set
forth
in
our
opinion
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
which
in
turn
in
respect
to
sentencing
affirm
the
district
court.
justice
stevens
has
filed
concurring
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
joins
in
part.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
and
justice
souter
has
filed
a

opinion.
