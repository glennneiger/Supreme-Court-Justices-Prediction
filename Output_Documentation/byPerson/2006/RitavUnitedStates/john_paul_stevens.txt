mr.
cochran,
you
do
contend,
do
you
not,
that
if
the
guidelines
had
been
mandatory,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the,
the
accessory
after
the
fact
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true,
just
to
get
one
thought
out
on
the
table,
that
there
are
factors
that
the
guidelines
don't...
did
not
consider,
such
as
military
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
under
the
guideline
no
weight
is
given
to
military
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
should
a
judge
do
if
he
thought
some
weight
should
be
given
to
military
service?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
this
is
the
hypothetical:
supposing
a
judge
thinks
military
service
is
relevant,
and
he
decides
to
impose
a
sentence
a
little
below
the
guidelines.
but
then
he
says,
i
recognize
that
in
this
circuit
there
is
a
strong
interest
in
uniformity
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
adopted
a
rule
where
they
will
presume
a
within
guidelines
sentence
is
reasonable
and
will
affirm
in
those
cases.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
i
would
be
wise
to
impose
the
guidelines
sentence,
so
i
will
do
so
even
though
my
own
judgment
is
that
it
should
be
slightly
lower.
what
should
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
such
a
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
reverse
the
judge
then,
within
a...
a
within
guidelines
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
he
operates
with
total
candor.
he's
saying
exactly
what
he
feels
like
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
didn't
say
you're
obligated,
but
you
can
be
pretty
sure
you'll
be
affirmed
if
you
do
impose
within
guidelines
sentences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
district
judge
is
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
which
i
take
it
means
there's
a
presumption
he
got
it
right.
is
that
correct?
there's
a
presumption
the
district
judge
sentence
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
shouldn't
there
be
also
the
same
presumption
when
it
is
outside
the
guidelines
range?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
the
interest
in
uniformity,
in
same
sentences
across
the
board
is
stronger
than
the
interest
in
getting
the
correct
sentence
for
the
particular
defendant
who's
in
court
at
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
there
isn't.
but
if
you
say
the
district
judge
has
broad
discretion,
which
he
does,
and
the
review
is
under
abuse
of
discretion,
why
should
there
not
always
be
a
presumption
that
the
district
judge
got
it
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
sort
of
like
findings
of
fact.
they
must
take
into
consideration
all
sorts
of
aspects
of
the
case,
and
you
have
a
strong
presumption
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
accurate.
why
don't
you
have
a
strong
presumption
that
the
ultimate
judgment
on
the
sentence
is
also
accurate?
