mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
system
described
in
justice
breyer's
opinion
for
the
court
in
booker,
judges
would
no
longer
be
tied
to
the
sentencing
range
indicated
in
the
guidelines.
that,
of
course,
was
a
passage
from
this
court's
recent
decision
in
cunningham
versus
california.
mr.
rita
is
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
reiterate
in
strong
enforceable
terms
that
it
meant
what
it
said
in
booker,
that
the
guidelines
are
merely
advisory
provisions.
the
government's
assertion
that
the
guidelines
deserve
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
was
nothing
more
than
an
unfounded
claim
put
forth
to
justify
its
efforts
to
try
and
thwart
the
booker
decision.
the
ink
wasn't
given
a
chance
to
dry
on
the
booker
decision
before
the
department
of
justice
issued
a
memo
to
all
of
its
federal
prosecutors
directing
that
they
adhere
to
the
guidelines
and
that
they
seek
sentences
within
the
guidelines
in
all
but
extraordinary
cases.
the
district
court
below
in
this
case
did
not
treat
the
guidelines
as
advisory
when
it
imposed
a
33-month
within
guideline
sentence.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
mr.
rita's
military
record,
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
combat
soldier
in
two
wars.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
in
the
district
court,
mr.
rita
did
put
forward
evidence
of
his
military
records,
health
concerns,
he...
the
district
court
received
that
information.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
that
information
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
where
the
district
judge
weighed
any
of
that
information
to
determine
what...
what
effect
to
give
any
of
it.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
justice
breyer,
the
district
judge
didn't
say
that
we're
going
to
weigh
all
of
the
stuff,
and
i--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--well,
in
the
instance
of
a
summary
judgment
matter,
we
don't
have
3553(c),
that
requires
the
district
court
to
state
in
open
court
in
front
of
the
defendant
the
reasons
for
the
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
with
regard
to
the
first
question
your
honor
posed,
it's
not
sufficient
for
the
district
court
to
simply
state
conclusions,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
that--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--well,
in
3553(c),
it
requires
that
the
judge
give
the
reasons
for
the
imposition
of
the
particular
sentence.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
the
preamble
states--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
on
page
3-a
of
petitioner's
brief
in
the
appendix.
it
states,
"the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
shall
state
in
open
court
the
reasons
for
its
imposition
of
the
particular
sentence.
"
and
that's
what
we
contend
requires
the
district
court
to
explain
the
facts
that
the
court
is
relying
on
to
impose
the
particular
sentence
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
that's
correct,
your
honor.
because
the
guidelines
don't
take
into
account
all
the
myriad
facts,
and
in
this
case,
did
not
take
into
account
the
military
record,
the
employment
record,
mr.
rita's
health
concerns.
the
guidelines
specifically
did
not
take
those
into
account.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
your
honor,
i
think
the--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--i
don't
think
that
this
is
unusual,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
has
to
explain
the
rationale
for
imposing
the
sentence,
and
not
only
does
it
have
to
do
so
in
court,
in
front
of
the
defendant,
so
the
defendant
understands
the
sentence
that
he
is
receiving--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--i
think
it
would
have
to
be
specific
to
the
issues
raised
by
the
parties.
and
in
this
case,
at
a
minimum,
the
judge
would
have
to
address
the
three
issues
that
mr.
rita
put
forward
and
discuss
those:
his
military
record,
his
employment,
his
health
concerns.
it
would
have
to
address
any
issues
that
the
government
would
raise,
and
any
issues
that
the
district
judge
was
considering
that
maybe
neither
party
had
raised
to
the
court
as
well.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
i
think
foremost,
your
honor,
is
that
that
provision
came
about
prior
to
the
booker
decision
when
the
guidelines
were
mandatory.
and
what
that
addresses
and
what
it
was
meant
to
address
was
if
the
court
were
to
depart,
then
it
was...
it
needed
to
explain
that
departure
in
a
greater
reason
to
enable
the
sentencing
commission
to
take
that
information
into
account
in
revising
the
guidelines.
that
is
still
a
purpose
with
the
sentencing
commission,
to
revise
the
guidelines,
and
they
can
still
use
that
information.
but
it...
at
the
very
least,
we
need
information
from
the
sentencing
judge
about
each
of
the
matters
that
he
or
she--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--the
specific
reason
i
think,
your
honor,
is
so
that
the
sentencing
commission
can
take
that
information
into
account
in
later
revisions
of
the
guidelines.
that
was
the
purpose
at
the
point
that
statute
was
passed.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
if
it's
so
much
that
it
should
be
ignored
inasmuch
as
the
district
court
needs
to
give
as
many
reasons,
or
as
clear
a
reason
for
the
imposition
of
the
particular
sentence.
that
will
help--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--it,
it
may,
your
honor.
and,
and
because
that
provision
predated
this
court's
booker
decision,
it
still
holds
relevance
but
not
nearly
the
relevance
it
had
when
the
guidelines
were
mandatory.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
certainly
could
consider
all
of
that;
and...
and
if
pressed
by
the
government
would
need
to
consider
that.
but
certainly
at
a
minimum,
the
court
needs
to--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--it
did,
your
honor,
and
again
the
district
court
never
came
out
with
any
specifics
regarding
any
of
those
issues
other
than
the
conclusion
that
it
felt
that
the
guideline
range
was
not
inappropriate.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--i
think
it's
inappropriate,
your
honor,
because
while
there
should
be
uniformity
in
an
attempt
to
move
in
that
direction,
uniformity
is
not
the
end
all
and
be
all.
3553(a)
addresses
individualized
sentencing
of
the
defendant
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i
don't
believe
the
booker
decision
rejected
that,
your
honor.
what
i
believe
the
booker
opinion
said
was
that
for
there
to
be
advisory
guidelines,
for
there
to
be
constitutional
sentencing
practices,
then
uniformity
is
going
to
have
to
give
way
to
some
extent.
at
least
at
the
very
beginning.
once
the
district
courts
apply
the
3553(a)
factors,
and
go
through
the
statute,
and
consider
the
guidelines,
the
district
courts
will
then
explain
their
rationale;
and
then
that
rationale
will
be...
in
our
opinion,
will
show
where
the
shortcomings
of
the
guidelines
are.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
not
as
it
was
applied.
it
came
close
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
was
laboring,
in
our
opinion,
under
the
belief
that
the
guidelines
held
some
control.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
it
came...
it
may
have
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
i
don't
know
that
i
would
concede
that.
but
to
avoid
any
constitutional
issue,
if
we
analyzed
this
under
the
statute,
clearly
the
district
court
didn't
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
the
district
court
held
the
guidelines
to
a
greater
quantum
than
simply
advisory.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
under...
under
a
pure
advisory
system...
and
i
think
your
honor
is
addressing
the
cross-reference
in
this
matter...
in
a
purely
advisory
system,
the
guidelines
were
calculated
correctly
in
mr.
rita's
case,
because
under
a
purely
advisory
system,
the
district
court
could
look
at
that
cross-reference,
understand
that
it
came
about
from
uncharged
and
unproven
conduct,
and
disregard
it.
but
by
not
doing
so
in
this
case,
and
that
cross
enhancement
doubled
his
effective
guideline
range,
then
this
case
may
very
well
be
unconstitutional
because
of
the
extra
weight
that
the
court
gave
the
guidelines.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
that's
right,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
our
position
is
that
the
presumption
does
violate
the
sixth--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--your
honor,
the
guidelines
should
be
consulted.
no
question--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
court
needs
to
very
clearly
explain
that
the
guidelines
are,
are
a
reference.
they
are--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--are
a
reference.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i
don't...
when
we
start
establishing
benchmarks
and
presumptions,
i
think
that's
where
we,
we--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--that's
bad,
too.
and
i
think
it's
just
another
thing
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
and
what
that
tells
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that,
that
the
district
court
felt
that
the
guidelines
had
a
center
of
gravity,
that
the
judge
was
bound...
in
other
words,
shifted
the
burden
to
the
defendant
to
say,
well,
i...
unless
you
can
show
that
these
are
inappropriate,
that
it
is
a
setting
of
a
benchmark,
it's
a
drawing
of
a
line,
and
we
contend
that
that
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
prohibits.
if
the
guidelines
are
advisory,
if
they
are
but
one
of
many
factors
to
be
considered,
together
with
all
of
the
other
factors
in
3553(a),
the
court
can
use
that
information,
can
use
that
reference.
but
once
it
starts
putting
any
greater
weight
on
the
guidelines...
and
the
statute
doesn't
admit
to
that.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
your
honor,
the
sentencing
commission
by
its
own
admission
has
not
taken
into
account
all
of
the
factors.
in
the
very
first
guideline
manual,
1987,
the
sentencing
commission
itself
said
it
could
not
take
into
account
all
of
the
facts
that
play
into
human
conduct.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i'm
not,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
don't
know
and
would
contend
that
the
initial
sentencing
commission
did
not
take
into
account
all
of
the
four
purposes
of
sentencing.
they
centered
on
crime
control--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--the
other
point
i
think
with
regard
to
that,
your
honor,
is
in
looking
at
3553(a)
that
statute
gives
the
district
court
the
dual
commands
of
first
considering
all
of
those
factors
and
then
imposing
a
sentence
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary.
the
statute
does
not
give
to
the
sentencing
commission
that
obligation.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--in
a
purely
advisory
system,
the
district
court
is
bound
by
the
statutory
minimum
and
maximum.
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
cunningham,
if
the
court
is
bound
simply
by
that
statutory
minimum
and
maximum,
then
the
factual
finding
as
to
where
within
that
is
up
to
the
district
court.
it's
only
when
we
establish
thresholds
as
the
guidelines
do
we
run
into
the
constitutional
problem.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
i
think
so
long
as
the
district
court
can
evaluate
and
consider
and
potentially
reject
what
the
guidelines
say,
just
as
the
court
can
consider
the
effect
of...
of
the
person's
military
record,
mr.
rita
was
a
combat
veteran
in
two
wars,
which
is
separate
and
apart
from
someone
who
may
have
been
an
army
recruiter--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--it
is.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
i
think
what
the
court
would
have...
the
appellate
court
would
have
to
do
is
evaluate
all
of
that
through
the
prism
of
3553(a).
is
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
the
least
sufficient
sanction
that
the
court
below
could
have
imposed.
and
if
not,
for
whatever
reasons,
vacate
it
and
return
it
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
there
is.
and
again,
because
3553(a)
is
an
individual
weighing
of
the
defendant--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--if
the
district
court
considers
all
those
facts
and
considers
what
may
have
been
done
and
it
is
sufficient,
if
not
greater
than
necessary
given
those
facts,
then
the
court
can
do
that.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
well,
the
guidelines
didn't
take
everything
into
account,
and
the
sentencing
courts
were
coming
from
18
years
of
mandatory
guidelines,
of
being
required
to
follow
this
book
that
necessarily
didn't
incorporate
all
of
the
human
factors
in
sentencing.
and
they
have
held
to
that.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
in
theory,
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
in
practice,
no,
because
what
happened
in
the
very
cases
as
united
states
versus
foy
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
defendant
in
that
case
argued
to
the
district
court
that
he
should
have
a
departure
based
upon
lack
of
youthful
guidance,
and
it
was
a
reasoned
decision.
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
found
it
to
be
a
reasoned
decision;
and
within
the
next
amendment
process
of
the
sentencing
commission,
it
was
eliminated
as
a
departure
basis
with
no
discussion
at
all.
so
yes,
there
may
have
been
departures,
but
they
were
systematically
removed,
and
in
fact
chapters
5(h)
and
5(k)
show
that
very
clearly.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
they
weren't
considered,
your
honor,
and
in
the
history
of
those
amendments
that's
borne
out.
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
return
first
to
the
across
the
board
reasonableness
review
that
this
court
established
in
booker.
that
in
and
of
itself
shows
why
there
cannot
be
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
on
appeal.
because
you
are
holding
the
presumption
to
a
different
standard
at
that
point.
it
is
not
a
reasonableness
across
the
board.
you
are
putting
the
burden
on
one
the
parties,
most
likely
the
defendant,
to
come
forward
and
explain
why
the
presumption
should
be
rebutted.
that
flies
in
the
face
with
the
across
the
board
reasonableness
this
court
set
forth
in
booker.
the
guidelines
are
fraught
with
disparity.
that
why
is
they
are
advisory.
that's
why
they
can
only
be
advisory.
and
the
district
courts
must
be
allowed
to
look
at
them,
to
see
them,
to
consider
them,
but
ultimately
to
impose
a
sentence
outside
them
for
valid
reasons.
in
mr.
rita's
case,
the
court
didn't.
the
court
felt
the
guidelines
held
some
undue
weight.
it
is
indicated
in
the
record
in
two
places,
first
and
foremost
on
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentencing
hearing
states:
other
than
the
motion
for
downward
departure
that
you
submitted,
do
you
have
any
other
objections;
and
what
i'm
trying
to
do
now
is
determine
where
your
client
fits
within
the
sentencing
guidelines.
clearly
the
judge
was
rooted
in
the
guidelines
and
that's
why
he
gave
a
sentence
of
33
months
at
the
low
end.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
that's
correct.
that's--
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
interestingly
the
court
found
very
dubious
the
additional
information
regarding
the
cross-reference.
and
on
page
87
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
states
it
was
not
able
to
evaluate
the
seriousness
of
that
other
investigation;
and
yet
that
was
the
cross-reference
that
doubled
his
guidelines
sentence.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
rule
in
this
case
that
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
cannot
be
accorded
to
the
guidelines.
mr.
thomas

your
honor,
the
other
one
was
page
87.
mr.
thomas
n.
cochran
and
that
would
be
in
the
second
paragraph,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
the
court
found
it
was
unable
to
stray
or
found
the
guidelines
were
inappropriate;
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
a,
a
giving
of
greater
weight
and
too
much
so
in
this
case.
your
honor,
mr.
rita
asks
the
court
to
find
that
a
presumption
cannot
be
accorded
to
the
guidelines,
that
his
sentence
was
unreasonable
in
this
case,
and
that
his
case
be
returned
for
resentencing.
thank
you.
