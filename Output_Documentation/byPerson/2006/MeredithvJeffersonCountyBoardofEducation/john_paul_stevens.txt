justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
prompted
really
by
your
argument
in
the
last
case.
i
wonder
about
the
purity
of
the
motive
that's
required.
supposing
you
had
a
city
like
chicago
with
a
neighborhood
school
system
and
in
one
neighborhood
there
was
a
school
that
was
100
percent
african
american,
both
student
body
and
faculty,
and
up
on
the
north
side
there's
a
school
that's
100
percent
white,
both
students
and
faculty.
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
school
board
to
decide
that
it
would
be
healthy
for
both
schools
to
have
five
african
american
schools
in
the
north
side
school
and
five
white
teachers
in
the
south
side
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
order
that,
hire
teachers
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
purpose
is
racial
integration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
say
some.
we
want
to...
we're
going
to
make
a
decision
there
will
be
some
white
teachers
and
some
african-american
teachers
in
the
other.
and
we're
going
to
do
it
no
matter...
if
the--
constitution
permits
it.
and
that's
our
only
motive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
example
is
100
percent
motive
to
avoid
100
percent
segregation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
some,
any
without
violating
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
judge
kozinski
thought
the
real
problem
here
was
we
should
not
deify
strict
scrutiny.
that's
what's
caused
all
the
problems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
often
true
that
sometimes
doctrines
do
have
unintended
consequences
when
you
push
the
logical
extremes.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
that
we've
made
a
judgment,
the
local
school
board
has
made
a
judgment
which
has
a
lot
of
experience
under
both
systems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just.
was
there
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
there
any
votes
in
favor
of
the
en
banc
rehearing?
