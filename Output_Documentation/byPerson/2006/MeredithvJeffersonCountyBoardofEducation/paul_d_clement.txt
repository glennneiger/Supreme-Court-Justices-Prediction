mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
son
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
transfer
from
young
elementary
school
to
bloom
elementary
school
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
i'd
have
to...
i
mean,
i
think
it
would
depend--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
if
you
build
into
the
hypo
that
the
only
purpose
was
race
and
then
it
was
done
in
a
way
that
made
it
express
that
the
teachers
were
going
to
be
moved,
that
you
were
basically
going
to
have
five
and
five,
you
were
going
to
have
a
quota
at
the
two
schools
on
the
basis
of
race,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
would
think,
though,
that
there
are
many
ways
you
can
accomplish
similar
objectives
without
making
it
so
explicit.
and
i
do
think
that
in
this
context,
i
mean,
there
is
an
independent
constitutional
value
in
not
having
these
kind
of
express
racial
classifications
drawn.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
but
i
think
that's
the
point,
which
is
that
is
an
important
objective,
but
i
have
little
doubt
that
that
can
be
accomplished
without
the
kind
of
five
by
five
quotas.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
be
clear,
though,
what
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
was
really
focused
not
on
the
broader
problem,
but
specifically
with
respect
to
faculties.
and
i
think
that
one
is
a
little
easier
in
the
sense
that
i
don't
know
of
any
school
districts
that
have
tried
to
maintain
the
kind
of
express
quotas
in
teaching
that
he
was
indicating.
i'm
not
here
to
tell
you
that
this
problem
is
simple
to
solve.
i'm
here
to
tell
you,
though,
that
i
think
the
constitution
provides
an
answer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
let
me
tell
you
what
i
certainly
think
they
could
do,
which
is
to
say,
look,
you
know,
we
don't
have
any
balance
in
these
two
faculties.
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we're
going
to
mix
some
of
them
up,
we're
going
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
looks
at
a
variety
of
factors,
including
who
is
good
with
young
kids,
who
is
good
with
older
kids.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
if
what
they
end
up
doing
at
the
end
is
not
only
a
hundred
percent
motive,
but
a
racial
classification,
then
i
think
runs
afoul
of
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
just
to
be
clear,
our
answer
to
the
hypothetical
a
hundred
percent
motivation,
no
racial
classification,
is
that
it
is
still
okay.
now,
some
members
of
the
court
may
disagree
with
us
on
that.
but
what
i
would
say
is
it
probably
doesn't
have
that
great
an
import
in
practice,
because
although
it
is
easy
to
come
up
with
the
hypothetical
that
race
is
the
absolute
and
sole
motivating
factor,
i
think
in
this
context
in
particular,
i
mean,
nobody...
you
know,
nobody
is
trying
to
do
this
solely
for
a
race-based
motive.
in
this
context,
they
also
have
an
educational
goal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
he
would
clearly
have
been
assigned
to
one
school,
and
one
set
of
schools
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
guess
i
don't.
and
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
but
i
think
that...
you
know,
the
dual
school
system
predated
the
court
ordered
decree,
which
is
part
of
where
we
have
gotten
to
with
resides
schools
and
the
like.
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
he
was
denied
transfer
to
bloom,
even
though
there
were
empty
seats
available
at
bloom
school.
so
if
he
had
been
an
african-american,
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
transfer
to
bloom.
instead,
he
was
prevented.
and
there
was
an
empty
seat
sitting
there
in
that
school.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
case
does
prevent
a
very
stark
racial
quota.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
there
are
several
responses.
one
is
that
the
constitution
puts
a
particular
premium
on
avoiding
express
racial
classifications.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
you
may
have
developed
that
jurisprudence
in
cases
where
it
was
clear
there
was
stigma
going
on,
but
you
have
extended
it
in
croson
and
in
adarand
across
the
board.
and
i
have
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
choices
were
being
denied.
and
i
think
you
made
the
distinction
earlier
between
an
educational...
guarantee
of
some
educational
opportunity
and
a
choice.
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
may
be,
justice
souter.
but
what
i
guess
i
would
say
is
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
certainly
require
reconsideration
of
the
gratz
case.
and
this
court
in
that
context
thought
that
individualized
consideration
even
if
it
was
going
to
be
very
difficult
in
the
context
of
the
university
of
michigan's
25,000
admissions
to
the
undergraduate
program,
this
court
said
individualized
consideration
was
part
of
the
constitutional
guarantee.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
i
think,
justice
souter,
if
you
think
it
is
an
important
value
to
have
a
degree
of
integration
in
the
schools,
well,
i
think
you
can
take
race
neutral
means
that
will
get
you
a
degree
of
integration
in
the
schools.
what
i
think
is
troubling,
and
what
happens
in
cases
like
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
if
you
decide
that
candor
is
an
affirmative
good
in
the
use...
in
the
race
area,
i
think
what
you
get
is
necessarily
what
you
have
here,
which
is
strict
racial
bands.
50,
15
percent.
that's
not
a
degree
of
integration.
it
is
a
clear
effort
to
try
to
get
the
individual
schools
to
mimic
the
overall
demographics--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
understand
that,
justice
breyer.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
lesson
of
history
in
this
area
is
that
racial
classifications
are
not
ones
where
we
should
just
let
local
school
board
officials
do
what
they
think
is
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
everybody
concedes
that
strict
scrutiny
is
going
to
apply
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
we
would...
you
know,
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
details
of
the
plan.
that's
what
narrow
tailoring
meant.
and
i
think
that's
what...
you
know,
justice
kennedy
made
the
point
in
his
opinion
in
grutter
that
the
problem
with
approving
the
first
blunderbuss
opportunity
that
you
see
to
use
race
in
a
context
is
that
then
you
deprive
the
courts
of
any
role
trying
to
refine
matters,
and
seeing,
maybe
the
racial
situation
would
be
narrowly
tailored,
but
it
is
sure
not
these
50-15
bands.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
justice
stevens,
he
probably
could
have
cited
two
of
your
opinions
for
that
proposition.
but
you
know,
the
rest
of
us
do
have
to
work
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there's
no
doubt
about
that,
but
the
rest
of
us
do
have
to
work
with
this
court's
precedents--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
and
it
also
has
some
real
world
consequences
when
we
decides
we're
not
going
to
apply
the
normal
scrutiny
we
would
to
racial
classifications
just
because
we've
made
some...
i
don't
know
based
on
what
judgment
that
in
this
case,
it
is
benign,
so
we
can
trust
the
local
school
officials.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
a
lot
of
experience
in
brown,
too,
and
those
were
local
school
boards,
too.
and
i
think
the
lesson
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
missed
that
in
the
joint
stipulation,
justice
scalia.
i
would
like
to
say
one...
if
i
could
make
one
point
here,
which
is,
i
really
do
think
that
it's
worth
looking
at
how
this
operates
in
practice.
and
the
fact
that
it
leaves
seats
effectively
fallow
in
schools.
because
that
really
marks
it
as
a
quota.
and
it's
interesting,
when
that
same
district
court
judge--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
was,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
think
there's
a
difference
when
you
move
past
unitary
status.
it's
interesting.
in
the
very
case
where
the
court,
hampton
ii,
where
the
same
district
court
found
unitary
status,
he
then
because
the
equal
protection
clause
was
not
shielded
by
the
decree,
had
to
apply
it
to
the
use
of
these
same
racial
bands
in
the
context
of
magnet
schools.
and
what
did
this
same
district
court
judge
find
there?
he
found
they
operated,
quote,
as
a
hard
racial
quota.
because
the
effect
of
these
50-15
bands
was
to
keep
hundreds
of
seats
at
central
high
school,
a
popular
magnet
school
empty,
and
away
from
african-american
students
because
the
district
wanted
to
maintain
its
predetermined
racial
balance.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
mean
the
united
states
government?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
or
the
school
board?
they
actually
both
opposed,
which
is
something...
shows
you
something
of
the
anomalies
that
you
can
get
from
this
situation,
which
is
the
school
board
wanting
to
continue
its
practice
of
using
these
racial
guidelines
actually
opposed
the
finding
of
unitary
status.
i
would
say,
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yeah,
we
had
some
specific
objections
in
which
we
thought
that
two
of
the
green
factors
were
not
satisfied.
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
judge's
finding
about
the
magnet
schools,
what
is
so
interesting
is
the
same
judge
finds
the
same
guidelines
to
be
a
hard
racial
quota
as
to
the
magnet
schools,
but
not
as
to
the
neighborhood
schools.
why
does
he
make
that
distinction?
because
he
finds
that
the
neighborhood
schools
are
basically
equal,
and
therefore,
denying
a
student
an
opportunity
to
attend
to
one
rather
than
another
was
not
an
injury
of
constitutional
magnitude.
but
i
would
have
thought
it
is
far
too
late
in
the
day,
and
the
chief
justice
suggested
this
as
well,
to
say
that
just
because
two
schools
are
basically
equal,
you
can
deny
a
student
the
right
to
attend
one,
and
assigns
one
and
only
one
based
on
his
race.
thank
you.
