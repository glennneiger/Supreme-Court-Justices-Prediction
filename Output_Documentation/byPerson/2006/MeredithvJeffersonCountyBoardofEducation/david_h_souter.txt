mr.
gordon,
in
responding
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
don't
you
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
this
court
said
in
the
second
swann
case
that
the...
that
a
school
district,
particularly
a
school
district
like
swann
which
had
been
in
violation,
had
been
found
in
violation,
had
the
same
interest
after
unitary
status
had
been
attained
in
maintaining
the
unitary
status
as
it
had
in
reaching
unitary
status
beforehand;
that
if
those
interests
are
identical
why
doesn't
it
follow
that
the
means
to
achieve
those
two
interests,
unitary
status
from
segregation
in
one
case,
preservation
of
unitary
status
in
the
other,
are
reasonable
if
they
are
identical?
justice
david
h.
souter
race-neutral
alternatives
for
what?
to
accomplish
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
unitary
status
and
unitary
condition?
unitary
condition
is
a
descriptive
situation.
it
describes
a
district
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
enough
of
a
racial
mix
so
that
there
is
no
credible
claim
either
that
there
is
de
facto
or
de
jure
segregation;
isn't
that
correct?
there
is
such
a
thing
as
unitary,
a
unitary
condition?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
the
preservation
of
a
unitary
condition
a
legitimate
or
indeed
a
compelling
governmental
objective?
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-huh.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
mean,
it
doesn't
work?
i
don't
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
what
it
is
that
hasn't
worked.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
what
your
friends
on
the
other
side
are
arguing.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
this,
and
i
think
this
applies
to
the
case
we
have
got,
as
well
as
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
you
said
in
justice
stevens'...
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
that
they
could
achieve
a
result,
legitimately
achieve
a
result
of
racial
mixture
within
the
respective
faculties
of
these
schools
if
they
took
other
things
in
addition
to
race
into
consideration.
you
mentioned
ability
as
teachers
and
so
on.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
object
of
doing
this,
which
justice
stevens'
hypo
assumed,
and
i
think
the
object
of
doing
it
which
your
answer
assumed,
was
the
achievement
of
racial
mixture
in
the
faculties.
my
question
is:
why
do
thy
have
to
hide
the
ball
by
saying,
oh,
we're
going
to
consider
these
other
things,
ability
to
teach,
educational
credits,
whatever
you
could
come
up
with
when
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end,
the
objective
is
to
achieve
a
racial
mix?
why
can't
they
do
that
candidly
and
employ
a
criterion
that
candidly
addresses
that
objective?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
has
developed
that
concern
in
cases
in
which
the
obvious
use
of
race
was
to
hurt
or
to
stigmatize.
here,
there
is
stigmatization
going
on
as
between
black
and
white,
when
we
say
there
is
a
value
in
mixing
them
up.
therefore,
why
should
that
same
concern
about
referring
to
race
at
all
be
applied
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
extended
it
in
cases
in
which
benefits
were
being
denied.
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
and
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
kindergarten
system
in
these
cases,
no
educational
benefit
was
being
denied.
justice
david
h.
souter
nothing
was
being
rationed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
simply
another
way...
when
you
say
it
is
the
choice
that's
being
denied,
and
that
has
to
be
the
focus
of
the
analysis,
that
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
you
may
never
use
the
means
of
race-conscious
distribution
to
achieve
the
educational
objective.
you're
saying
the
same
thing
in
a
different
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
gratz,
the
characteristics
of
individuals
that
could
be
considered
were
arguably
relevant
to
a
distribution
decision.
here,
the
sole
point
is
not
to
achieve
a
quota
by
relaxing
other
standards.
the
whole
point
is
to
achieve
a
value
which
comes
from
mixing
the
races,
from
distribution.
and,
therefore,
why
is
it
appropriate
to
look
to
other
things
as
opposed
to
looking
at
that
candidly,
if
that
is
a
legitimate
objective?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
may
use
those
race
neutral
means
only
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
that
mixture.
i
take
it
that's
the
assumption
of
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
objective
is
fine.
the
important
thing
is
simply
to
hide
the
ball.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
mellen,
here
is
a
question
i
should
have
asked
friends
on
the
other
side.
but
i
think
it
is
raised
by
justice
kennedy's
question,
so
let
me
put
it
out.
are
there
circumstances
under
which
there
is
reason
to
suspect
the
motivation
of
school
districts
when
they
come
up
with
a
plan
in
effect
to
require
a
mixing
of
the
races
in
the
schools
that
is
more
or
less
tailored
to
the
relative
percentages
in
the
communities?
is...
are
there
circumstances
in
which
that
would
be
done
for
malign
as
opposed
to
benign
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what...
give
me
some,
or
give
me
or
an
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
the
school
board
in
that
case
would
use
the
clumsy
means
of
racial
integrational
mixing
as
opposed
simply
to
devoting
more
money
to
the
black
schools?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would
think
so,
too.
