mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
crystal
meredith
wanted
to
do
what
most
moms
and
dads
do
all
across
this
country.
she
wanted
to
put
her
son's
hand
in
hers
and
walk
around
the
corner
and
enroll
her
son
in
school.
but
the
enrollment,
there
was
a
barrier,
and
the
pickaxe,
that
barrier
was
person
satisfied
as
a
quota.
there
were
seats
within
the
school.
it
wasn't
at
capacity.
it
wasn't
near
any
one
of
the
percentages
or
tipping
percentages
that
the
quota
system
in
jefferson
county
public
schools
applied.
but
she
was
not
allowed
in.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
well,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg,
she
moved
into
the
system
in
august.
when
she
moved
into
the
system,
she
was
assigned
to
a
school
called
breckenridge-franklin,
which
was
an
all
year
round
school.
then
she
was...
her
choice
was
managed
and
she
was
sent
an
hour
away
from
where
her
other
school
is.
she
applied
by
transfer,
which
is
the
system
that
you
use.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
i
think
she
was
living
in
florida,
and
she
moved
into
kentucky.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
yes.
so
that's
across
the
board.
anyone
that
moves
in,
they
are...
there
is
a
cluster
school
or
an
attempt
school,
and
if
you
are
not...
a
majority
of
the
time
you
are
not
allowed
there
because
of
your
race.
in
other
words,
they
want
to
assign
children
to
schools
that
don't
have
the
greater
percentages
of
either
african-american
or
caucasian.
so
in
bloom
elementary,
although
it
was
67-33...
and
keep
in
mind
in
kindergarten,
according
to
their
own
rules
and
regulations,
didn't
even
apply.
the
plan
was
so
inflexible--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--but
the
deadline
applies
to
that
school
which
presumably
is
closest
to
one's
residence.
now,
whether
or
not
you
get
into
that
school
or
don't
get
into
the
school
still
depends
on
the
quota.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
sure.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
she
filed
a
transfer.
the
transfer
was
denied.
and
at
that
time,
litigation
had
commenced
and
because
litigation
had
commenced...
and
routinely
these
appeals
are
denied.
all
of
her
efforts
were
futile.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
my
understanding
is
that
she
did.
that
was
denied,
because
the
only
time
joshua
got
into--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it
is.
in
either
event,
if
she
didn't
it
would
have
been
futile
because
we
had
already
made
her
the
third
amended
complaint
on
behalf
of
all
the
parties,
and
we
had
asked
for
injunctive
relief
within
the
litigation.
but
joshua
did
not
get
into
the
school
because
of...
until
they
moved.
they
had
to
move
a
block
away.
so
if
you
live
in
one
block
and
you
can't
get
into
that
school,
your
choice
is
managed.
the
plan
was
clearly
inflexibility
and
it
didn't
apply
to
kindergarten
anyhow,
but
it
still
caused
our
joshua
to
go
an
hour
away
from
his
home.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
the
third
amended
complaint,
the
may
2nd
complaint,
and
there
was
a
request
for
$25,000
damages.
and
within
these
schools,
in
other
words,
this
honorable
court
has
never
applied,
other
than
in
remedial,
has
never
applied
compelling
interest
in
a
k
through
12
setting.
in
fact,
those
rights
are
not
co-extensive.
the
school...
this
honorable
court
has
previously
stated
in,
for
example,
the
hazelwood
case,
which
was
a
first
amendment
right
case,
that
that
didn't
apply
to
k
through
12,
or
should
it
be
1
through
12
setting.
and
in
the
hazelwood
case,
that
was
a
basic
first
amendment
right
and
of
course
the
first
amendment
right
was
exactly
what
justice
powell
championed
as
academic
freedom
within
the
bakke
case.
so
clearly
bakke
and
grutter
are
distinguishable.
this
falls
into
gratz,
where
you
clearly
have
a
quota,
not
less
than
15
or
greater
than
50
percent,
is
totally
inflexible
as
applied
to
our--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--i'm
sorry.
it's
the
same
remedial
program
that...
this
court
has
found
even
in
dowd
that
when
the
remedial
program
has
achieved
its
result
we
should
no
longer
carve
out
that
exemption
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
well,
i
take
issue
that
it
worked
very
well.
in
other
words,
did
the
jefferson
county--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--well,
of
course
brown
versus
topeka
board
of
education
was
time
applicable.
if
you
use
time
applicable
now
for
the
jefferson
county
public
schools--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--and
in
the
hampton
case,
which
i
won,
all
right,
they
didn't
go
to
any
race-neutral
alternatives
at
all.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
well,
justice
souter,
this
court
over
and
over
again
has
said
once
a
remedial
plan
is
accepted
there
should
be
race-neutral
alternatives
under
the
narrow
and
tailored
requirement.
what
this
school
board
did
after
i
won--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
to
accomplish
the
same
means.
in
other
words,
what
they
could
have
done,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
was
put
more
magnet
schools,
more
traditional
schools,
have
more
open
enrollment.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
certainly.
that's
the
dow
case,
that
says
you
no
longer--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--certainly.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
in
hampton,
this...
our
court
found
that
it
was
unitary
status
as
opposed
to
unitary
condition.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
if
you
want
to
go
with
unitary
condition,
then
i
still
think
you
go
back
to
brown
and
you
say
has
it
worked.
in
other
words,
let's
make
it
time
applicable.
does
this
honorable
court--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--it
hasn't
worked.
it
just
absolutely
hasn't
worked.
so
we've
decided--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--why
do
we
have
to
choose
between
diversity
and
educational
outcome?
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
both.
why
can't
we
have
diverse...
why
can't
we
have
them
both.
it's
not
diversity
or
educational
outcome.
it's
diversity
and
educational
outcome.
for
30
years
in
this
country--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--no.
the
friends
on
the
other
side
are
arguing
that
there's
some
type
of
improvement
in
educational
outcome
solely
because
you
sit
black
children
next
to
white
children.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
my
response
is
that
you
have
those
series
of
cases
that
say
once
you've
achieved
the
unitary
status,
you
know
longer
get
to
carve
out
that
exemption
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
if
we're
going
to
carve
out
these
exemptions
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
we're
going
to
say
we're
going
to
not
apply
gratz
where
it's
a
quota
system
and
we
are
solely,
without
any
type
of
individual
holistic
review
applied
to
these
kids,
then
there
should
be
some
improvement
in--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--well,
of
course
this
system
didn't
apply
to
kindergarten
anyhow.
but
the
answer
is
it's
not.
you
have
to
decide.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
that
it
would
violate
your
ruling
in
gratz--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--out
of
hampton,
there
was
no
race-neutral...
race
alternative
means
used.
for
me,
i
would
use
all
these
millions
of
dollars.
i
would
reduce
teacher-student
ratio.
i
would...
i
would
give
incentive
pay
to
the
better
teachers.
i
would
more
magnet
schools,
more
traditional
schools.
we
presuppose
that
we're
going
to
have
bad
schools
and
good
schools
in
this
country.
i
don't
think
we
can
no
longer,
longer
accept
that.
we
can
no
longer
accept
an
achievement
gap
of
25
to
30
points
by
the
majority
of
african
american
kids
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
and
throughout
this
country
by
the
fourth
grade.
educational
outcome
is
the
only
key,
the
only
key
to
unlock
the
chains
of
poverty.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
then
let's
make
sure
they
go
to
the
better
schools.
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
racial
politics
is
involved
when
we
had
so
much
white
flight.
african
americans
in
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
the
largest
percent
go
to
the
worst
performing
schools.
the
lowest
percent
go
to
the
better
performing
schools.
that
can't
be
constitutional.
that
can't
be
discriminatory,
and
that
can't
be
an
exemption
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
equal
protection.
i'd
like
to
save
a
little
bit,
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
to
respond
to
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked,
it's
very
important
that
it
is
equally
consistent
in
the
1992
plan
to
effectuate
or
to
prevent
white
flight
that
the
plan
itself
was
changed
to
subjugate
african
american
kids
to
the
worse
performing
schools.
if
you
find
that
equally
consistent,
then
you
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
illegitimate
notions
of
racial
inferiority
applied
or
racial
politics
applied--
mr.
teddy
b.
gordon
--well,
in
the
'92
plan
and
from
that
point
on,
which
i
showed,
which
was
held
in
the
hampton
plan,
in
the
hampton
case...
in
other
words,
in
the
hampton
case
i
proved,
or
the
facts
proved
or
the
plaintiff
proved,
that
african
american
kids
were
denied
entrance
into
the
better
schools
solely
because
of
race.
within
the
vacuum
of
that
case,
there
was
also
proof
that
showed
the
largest
percent
of
african
american
kids
were
sent
or
denigrated
or
subjugated
to
the
worse
performing
schools
rather
than
the
best
performing
schools.
that
becomes
the
question
of
racial
politics
and
racial
animus,
and
that's
what
the
'92
plan
did.
and
what
it
did
to
attract...
or
prevent
white
flight,
was
have
less
african
american
kids
go
to
the
better
performing
schools
on
the
entire
k
through
12
setting.
that
can't
be
what
this
court
wants
to
carve
out
as
an
exemption
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
equal
protection
clause,
that's
on
neutral
parchment
with
black
ink.
there's
no
percents.
there's
no
box
to
check.
we
can't
have
this
in
our
school
system,
to
have
another
25
or
30
years
in
our
school
system,
which
will
perpetuate
racial
isolationism
because
it
does
nothing
to
stop
the
achievement
gap.
there
were
race-neutral
alternative
tracks.
all
i
can
say
is
that,
may
this
day
be
the
embryonic
beginning
of
dr.
king's
dream,
as
paraphrased,
that
all
children
are
now
judged
by
the
content
of
their
character
and
their
education,
not
by
the
color
of
their
skin.
