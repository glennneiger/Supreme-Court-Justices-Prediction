justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
because
she
applied
4
months
late?
if
she
had
applied
before
the
deadline
in
march,
would
you
be
here?
would
there
be
any
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
she
living
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
she...
that
was...
august
was
the
first
opportunity
she
had
to
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she,
she
could
have...
if
she
had
been
there
at
the
deadline,
the
child
would
have
been
admitted
to...
if
she
had
been
there
in
march
instead
of
august?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
past
that.
when
she
didn't
get
the
assignment
that
she
requested
for
her
son--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
she
appeal
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
for
first
grade?
did
she
make
an
application
for
first
grade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
in
the
record,
that
she
made
an
application
for
the
first
grade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
compare
with
the
system
that
was
in
effect
from,
what
was
it,
1975
until
2000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
there's
something
of
an
anomaly
there,
that
you
have
a
system
that
is
forced
on
the
school,
that
it
doesn't
want
it,
works
for
25
years,
and
then
the
school
board
doesn't
have
to
keep
it
any
more,
but
it
decides
it's
worked
rather
well,
so
we'll
keep
it.
what's
constitutionally
required
one
day
gets
constitutionally
prohibited
the
next
day.
that's
very
odd.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
board
decided
it
liked
the
way
things
were
going,
so
it
kept
it
or
something
close
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
the
plan
that
they've
had
for
25
years,
and
they
decided
to
keep
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
apply
a
holistic
review
to
a
kindergartner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
understand
an
approach
to
an
applicant
for
an
elite
school
and
so
you
judge
it
on
all
these
merit
factors
and
other
factors.
but
for
a
child
entering
the
first
grade,
i
don't
understand
this
individualized
holistic
approach.
what
else
is
there
other
than
that
the
child
is
of
a
certain
age
and
therefore
will
enter
a
certain
grade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
want
to
know...
you
said
that
there
are
alternate,
alternative
means,
so
i'm
asking
what
they
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
not
that
white
children
and
black
children
are
no
longer
sitting
together
on
the
same
school
benches?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
how
it
worked
under
the
plan
that
was
forced
on
the
school
district?
i
thought
it
was
roughly
the
same
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
government
in
2000
opposed
terminating
this...
the
compulsory
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
starting
place
was
the
plan
that
was
compulsory,
that
was
forced
on
the
school
district
in
1975?
that
is
basically
the
same
kind
of
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
happen
if
you
couldn't
use
this
system?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
attitude
is
the
one
that
this
board
has
taken,
then
the
same
reasons
would
exist
for
the
plan
as
long
as
there
is
segregation
in
housing.
