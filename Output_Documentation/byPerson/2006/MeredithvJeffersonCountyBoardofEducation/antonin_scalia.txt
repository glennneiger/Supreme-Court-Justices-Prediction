mr.
gordon,
isn't
it
the
case
that
once
you've
achieved
unitary
status,
which
means
that
the
effects
of
past
intentional
discrimination
have
been
eliminated,
the
only
way
you
can
lose
unitary
status
is
to
discriminate
intentionally?
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
the
race
of
the
school
board
here?
i
mean,
that
was
not...
how
do
we
know
these
are
benign
school
boards?
is
it
stipulated
that
they
are
benign
school
boards?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
doesn't?
i
mean,
this
which
is
somehow
based
on
the
notion
that
a
school
that
is
predominantly
black
or
overwhelmingly
black
cannot
be
as
good
as
a
school
that
is
predominantly
white
or
overwhelmingly
white?
that
doesn't
send
any
message?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
white
flight,
you're
not
talking
about
black
flight.
and
what's
going
on
here
is
makes
sure
that
there
are
a
certain
number
of
white
students
or
as
high
a
proportion
as
you
can
get.
in
schools
that
would
be
otherwise
be
overwhelmingly
black.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you
are
appealing
to
stigmatization,
that...
that
is
based
on
an
assumption
that
it
seems
to
me
is
stigmatizing.
justice
antonin
scalia
easy.
take
a
school
district
that
is
overwhelmingly
minority.
and...
overwhelmingly
black,
if
you
will.
and
a
school
board
that
reflects
that.
and
in
which
by
reason
of
residential
patterns,
the
white
schools,
despite
the
same
expenditure
of
money,
same
level
of
teaching
and
everything
else,
the
white
schools
are
better
schools.
and
the
school
board
could
decide
we
would
like
our
race
to
get
into
those
better
white
schools.
not
because
we
want
mixing.
we
just
want,
want
them
to
get
into
those
schools.
wouldn't
that
be
a
situation
in
which
the
board
could
then
come
up
with
a...
you
know,
these
good
schools
ought
to
have
80
percent
blacks
in
them?
i
would
not
consider
that
a
benign
objective.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there's
a
compelling
interest
in
doing
it
at
all.
they're
doing
it
for
a
racially
selfish
reason.
they
want
their
constituency,
they
want
the
80
percent
of
black
students,
to
be
in
the
better
schools.
you
consider
that
a
valid
interest,
and
a
non-racial
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
your
plan
has
the
overwhelming
support
of
the
community,
does
"community"
mean
those
parent
who
have
children
in
the
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
ought
to
be
the
really...
the
people
who
are
the
objects
of
this
experiment.
do
they
think
it's
doing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
did
the
parents'
satisfaction
with
it
break
out
along
racial
lines?
or
was
it
evenly
divided?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he's
talking
about
the
parents
of
students
in
the
school?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mellen,
i've
been
looking
at
dr.
kiefer's
testimony.
is
this
what
you're
referring
to:
"there
was
remarkable
agreement
among
every
group
in
jefferson
county
public
schools
about
how
desirable
having
diversity
in
the
schools
was?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
double
about
that.
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
ask
anybody,
you
know,
do
you
prefer
integrated
schools
or
would
you
prefer
lily-white
schools,
nobody
is
going
to
say
give
me
a
lily-white
school.
of
course
nobody's
going
to
say
that.
i
was
asking
whether
the
parents
whose
kids
can't
go
to
the
schools
they
want
to
go
to,
including
the
neighborhood
schools,
do
they
like
this
particular
system
of
achieving
the
racial
diversity?
is
there
any
testimony
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
black
and
white
alike?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
in
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
in
your
joint
appendix
here?
