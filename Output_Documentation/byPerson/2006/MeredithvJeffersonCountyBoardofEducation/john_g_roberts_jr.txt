meredith
v.
jefferson

of
education.
the
parents
involved
case
comes
to
us
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
concerns
the
adoption
and
implementation
by
the
seattle
school
district
where
a
student
assignment
plan
that
requires
all
students
to
identify
themselves
as
either
white
or
non-white.
seattle
then
uses
the
racial
classifications
to
help
insure
that
the
racial
balance
at
certain
schools
falls
within
a
predetermined
range
based
on
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
district
as
a
whole.
seattle
assignment
plan
allows
incoming
ninth
graders
to
choose
from
among
any
of
the
district’s
high
schools,
ranking
the
schools
in
order
of
preference.
if
too
many
students
list
the
same
school
as
their
first
choice
the
district
employees
a
series
of
tiebreakers
to
determine
who
will
fill
the
open
slots
at
the
oversubscribed
school.
the
first
tiebreaker
selects
students
who
have
a
sibling
at
the
school.
the
second
tiebreaker
is
based
on
race
if
the
school
is
racially
imbalanced
under
seattle’s
plan
and
that
it
has
too
many
non-white
students
than
white
students
will
be
selected
for
admission.
if
the
school
has
too
many
white
students
then
non-white
students
will
be
selected
to
move
the
school
closer
to
the
desired
racial
balance.
petitioner
parents
involved
the
group
of
parents
whose
children
have
been
or
maybe
dined
assignment
to
their
chosen
school
in
seattle
solely
because
of
their
race
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
seattle’s
assignment
plan
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
seattle’s
use
of
racial
classifications
was
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
a
compelling
government
interest
and
upheld
the
plan.
the
meredith
case
comes
to
us
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
concerns
the
jefferson
county
kentucky
student
assignment
plan.
jefferson
county
is
basically
metropolitan
louisville;
jefferson
county
classifies
its
students
as
either
black
or
other
and
makes
a
school
assignment
based
on
among
other
factors
the
district’s
racial
guidelines
which
require
all
schools
to
maintain
black
enrolment
of
between
15
and
50%.
petitioner
crystal
meredith
enrolled
her
son
joshua
a
kindergartner
in
jefferson
county’s
schools
upon
moving
to
the
district
and
after
he
was
assigned
to
a
school
far
from
home,
she
thought
to
transfer
joshua
to
a
nearby
elementary
school.
jefferson
county
denied
joshua’s
transfer
application
even
though
the
school
he
wish
to
attend
had
available
space
because
his
transfer
would
have
had
an
adverse
effect
on
his
current
school’s
compliance
with
the
racial
guidelines.
meredith
challenged
jefferson
county’s
use
of
the
racial
guidelines
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
school
districts
assignment
policy.
we
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases
and
now
reverse
in
both.
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
find
that
this
racial
classification
violates
the
constitution
for
the
following
reasons,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
government
classification
on
the
basis
of
race
only
where
the
classification
satisfy
the
familiar
“strict
scrutiny”
test
that
is
were
the
racial
classifications
are
shown
by
the
government
to
be
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
compelling
government
interest.
our
prior
cases
evaluating
the
use
of
racial
classifications
in
the
school
context
have
recognizes
two
such
compelling
interest.
the
first
is
the
compelling
interest
of
remedying
the
effects
of
past
intentional
discrimination
such
as
prior
segregation
by
law.
the
seattle
public
schools
have
not
argued
that
they
may
use
these
racial
classifications
because
they
were
previously
segregated
by
law
and
they
have
never
been
subject
to
court
ordered
desegregation.
the
jefferson
county
public
schools
were
previously
segregated
by
law
and
were
subject
to
a
desegregation
decree
entered
in
1975
but
this
decree
was
dissolved
in
2000
upon
a
finding
that
the
district
had
“eliminated
the
vestiges
associated
with
the
former
policy
of
segregation”
and
does
had
achieved
what
is
known
as
unitary
status.
neither
school
district
argues
that
this
remedial
justification
provides
a
compelling
interest
for
their
racial
classifications.
the
second
government
interest
we
have
recognized
as
compelling
for
purposes
of
strict
scrutiny
is
the
interest
in
diversity
in
higher
education
upheld
in
grutter
v.
bollinger.
the
diversity
interest
found
compelling
in
that
case
was
however
not
racial
diversity
alone,
the
use
of
race
in
grutter
was
upheld
only
as
part
of
a
“highly
individualized
holistic
review.”
we
emphasize
that
the
use
of
race
was
constitutional
because
it
was
part
of
a
broader
assessment
of
diversity
and
not
simply
an
effort
to
achieve
racial
balance
that
the
court
said
in
grutter
would
be
“patently
unconstitutional.”
in
these
cases
in
contrast
to
grutter
race
is
not
considered
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
achieve
“exposure
to
widely
diverse
people,
cultures,
ideas
and
viewpoints.”
race
for
some
students
is
determinative
standing
alone.
the
court
in
grutter
defined
a
specific
type
of
broad-based
diversity
and
emphasized
the
unique
context
of
higher
education
in
upholding
the
racial
classifications.
neither
of
these
characteristics
exists
in
these
cases
and
the
compelling
interest
in
student
body
diversity
in
higher
education
recognized
in
grutter
cannot
support
the
districts
use
of
race.
when
it
comes
to
the
narrow
tailoring
requirement
we
conclude
that
the
districts
have
not
met
their
burden
of
showing
that
these
racial
classifications
are
necessary
to
achieve
their
stated
ends.
every
student
is
seattle
is
labeled
white
or
non-white;
every
student
in
jefferson
county
is
labeled
black
or
other.
if
the
minimal
effect
these
classifications
actually
have
on
student’s
assignments
suggest
that
other
regimes
would
be
as
effective
in
achieving
the
district’s
stated
goals.
seattle’s
racial
tiebreaker
results
in
the
end
only
in
shifting
a
few
students
between
the
schools.
seattle
can
identify
only
a
small
number
of
students
who
were
ultimately
affected
adversely
by
the
racial
tiebreaker.
similarly,
jefferson
county
estimates
that
the
racial
guidelines
account
for
only
3%
of
assignments
and
states
the
guidelines
have
minimal
impact
on
the
assignment
process.
the
minimal
impact
of
the
districts
racial
classifications
has
doubt
on
the
necessity
of
using
racial
classifications
in
the
first
place.
classifying
and
assigning
school
children
according
to
a
binary
conception
of
race
is
an
extreme
approach
in
light
of
our
precedence
in
history,
and
requires
a
greater
showing
of
necessity
to
justify
it.
in
a
portion
of
my
opinion
joined
by
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
alito
we
further
conclude
that
these
assignment
plans
do
not
further
a
compelling
interest
in
racial
diversity
that
the
district’s
claim
to
see.
both
school
districts
assert
interest
in
reducing
racial
isolations
in
schools
and
educating
students
in
a
racially
diverse
learning
environment.
the
racial
classifications
employed
by
the
districts
however
are
not
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
these
articulated
goals.
instead
the
plans
are
directed
only
to
racial
balance,
an
objective
this
court
has
repeatedly
condemned
as
to
illegitimate.
the
plans
are
tied
to
each
district’s
specific
racial
demographics,
rather
than
to
any
pedagogic
concept
of
the
level
of
diversity
needed
to
obtain
the
asserted
educational
benefits.
the
districts
offer
no
evidence
that
the
level
of
racial
diversity
necessary
to
achieve
the
asserted
educational
benefits
coincides
with
the
particular
concept
or
proportionality
they
have
decided
to
advance.
seattle
classifies
its
students
as
simply
white
or
non-white
and
seeks
enrolments
that
reflect
racial
proportionality
only
in
white,
non-white
terms.
but
seattle’s
non-white
population
is
composed
of
numerous
different
racial
and
ethnic
groups
24%
asian-american,
23%
african-american,
10%
latino,
3%
native-american.
under
seattle’s
definition
a
school
that
is
50%
white
and
50%
asian-american
would
qualify
as
racially
diverse
but
a
school
that
is
30%
asian-american,
25%
african-american,
25%
latino
and
20%
white
would
be
considered
racially
imbalanced.
such
a
plan
cannot
be
considered
narrowly
tailored
to
be
asserted
compelling
interest
in
racial
diversity.
we
have
many
times
over
reaffirmed
including
in
grutter
that
racial
balance
is
not
to
be
achieved
for
its
own
sake.
accepting
racial
balancing
is
a
compelling
state
interest
would
justify
the
indefinite
imposition
of
racial
proportionality
throughout
our
society.
the
principle
that
racial
balancing
is
not
permitted
is
one
of
substance
not
semantics.
racial
balancing
is
not
transformed
from
patently
unconstitutional
as
we
put
it
in
grutter
to
a
compelling
state
interest
simply
by
re-labeling
it
“racial
diversity”.
well
the
school
districts
use
various
verbal
formulations
to
describe
the
interest
they
seek
to
promote;
they
offer
no
definition
of
the
interest
that
suggests
that
in
these
cases
it
differs
from
racial
balance.
we
disagree
with
the
dissent’s
reliance
on
the
compelling
interest
in
remedying
prior
segregation
to
uphold
the
use
of
race
in
these
plans.
no
one
questioned
that
race
conscious
remedies
maybe
use
to
redress
prior
illegal
segregation.
but
neither
district
has
argued
that
its
use
of
race
can
be
sustained
on
that
basis
and
these
cases
are
before
us
because
seattle
was
not
segregated
by
law
and
jefferson
county
has
been
found
who
have
eliminated
the
vestiges
of
its
prior
segregation.
the
justification
for
race
conscious
remedies
from
our
desegregation
cases
is
not
applicable
here.
the
dissenting
opinions
also
argue
that
a
standard
overview
less
stringent
than
strict
scrutiny
should
be
applied
to
consider
the
districts
use
of
racial
classifications
because
the
districts
seek
to
use
race
for
inclusive
purposes
and
not
to
exclude.
this
argument
has
been
frequently
made
and
frequently
rejected.
our
precedence
may
clear
that
all
racial
classifications
must
be
evaluated
under
strict
scrutiny.
in
an
area
as
sensitive
as
the
government’s
use
of
express
racial
classifications
we
will
not
put
our
faith
in
the
good
intentions
of
the
government
alone.
it
is
also
inaccurate
to
describe
these
plans
as
inclusive
rather
than
exclusive.
they
do
not
exclude
all
members
of
a
particular
racial
group
from
school
but
they
do
exclude
individuals
solely
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
our
cases
have
repeatedly
explained
that
the
right
to
equal
protection
is
an
individual
right
not
a
group
right.
the
dissent’s
position
comes
down
to
this,
the
end
justifies
the
means
but
no
matter
how
desirable
the
district’s
goals
maybe
in
these
cases
they
have
not
shown
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
to
achieve
them.
now
the
parties
vigorously
debate
which
side
is
more
faithful
to
the
heritage
of
our
decision
in
brown
v.
board
of
education
this
is
a
“from
the
argument
of
the
plaintiff’s
school
children
in
brown.”
we
have
one
fundamental
contention
which
we
will
seek
to
develop
in
the
course
of
this
argument
and
that
contention
is
that
no
state
has
any
authority
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
use
race
as
a
factor
in
affording
educational
opportunities
among
its
citizens.
it
was
that
position
that
prevailed
in
this
court
which
emphasize
in
its
remedial
opinion
in
brown
that
what
was
required
was
“to
achieve
a
system
of
determining
admission
to
the
public
schools
on
a
non-racial
basis.”
how
can
plans
such
as
these
that
look
at
individual
children
and
say
“you
cannot
come
to
this
school
if
you
are
black
or
you
can
not
come
to
this
school
if
you
are
white”,
you
said
to
be
determining
admission
on
a
nonracial
basis.
for
schools
that
did
not
segregate
on
the
basis
of
race
such
as
seattle
or
they
have
removed
the
vestiges
of
past
segregation
such
as
jefferson
county.
the
way
“to
achieve
a
system
of
determining
admission
in
public
schools
on
a
nonracial
basis
is
to
stop
assigning
students
on
a
racial
basis”.
we
conclude
that
these
racial
classifications
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
