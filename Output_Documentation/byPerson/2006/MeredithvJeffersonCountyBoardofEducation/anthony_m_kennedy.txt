justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand,
and
i'm
just
wondering
whether
in
your
view
that
independent
value
could
ever
be
trumped
by
the
obvious
countervailing
value
of
having
some
african
americans
see
some
white
teachers
and
vice
versa?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
also
have
unintended
consequences
when
this
court
ignores
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
case
present
the
story
where
the
meaning
of
brown
versus
board
of--
education
is
you
can
never
take
race
out
of
politics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i,
i
think
that's
probably
true.
i
think
it
is
also
probably
true
that
the
people
in
your
community
and
the
people
on
your
school
board
are
acting
in
the
utmost
good
faith.
and
that
what
they
have
done
is
going
to
help
the
education
of
many
students.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we
can
say
that
an
insincere
school
board,
people
that
want
to
play
the
race
card,
who
want
to
play
the
race
trip,
the...
the
race
chip,
that
want
a
system
in
which
they
can
use
race
for
political
advantage,
can
do
this
based
on
the
color
of
the
individual
child's
skin.
that's
what's
involved
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
conceding
that.
the
constitution
assumes
that
this
might
not
always
be
the
case.
are
we
going
to
look
at
the
sincerity
of
the
school
boards,
school
by
school
board,
school
board
member
by
school
board
member?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it,
but
it
presents
the
principle
that
this
court
is
confronted
with.
if
we
for
the
first
time
say
that
a
system
that
has
achieved
unitary
status.
so
that
the
courts
no
longer
have
the
authority
or
the
need
to
supervise
them,
can
then
turn
around
and
use
individual
skin
color
as
a
basis
for
assignment,
we've
never
said
that.
and
that
takes
us
on
a
very
perilous
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
university
cases
this
court
ran
as
far
away
as
it
could
from
using
racial
quotas.
it
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
was
an
individualized
assessment.
at,
at
issue
was
a
university
student
who
could
understand
the
reasons
for
being
rejected
on,
on
the
grounds
of
race,
race
being
one
criteria.
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
once
again,
once
again,
one
of
the
rationales
for
the
law
school
cases
was
a
first
amendment
rationale.
and
you,
and
i
think
properly
so,
say
that
this
is,
this
is
not
your
interest.
i
agree
with
you.
but
that
means
that
that
case
is
completely
inapplicable
to
help
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think...
i
think
we
were
communicating.
swann
was
a
case
where
there
was
de
jure
discrimination.
bakke
was
a
university
case.
this
is
a
different
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's,
and
it's
a
troubling
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
were
to
become
relevant,
would
this
record
show...
this
is
the
school
district...
and
this
would
be
in
the
regime
of
the
court-ordered
desegregation
plan,
because
you
are
just
recently
emerged
from
that...
that
the
school
district
has
tried
means
other
than
race
conscious,
of
race
classification
in
order
to
obtain
the
diversity
benefits
you
seek?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
were
those
magnet
schools?
and
could
you
tell
me
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
any
of
those
study
the
possibilities
of
the
system
in
which
you
elect
to
go
into
a
system
where
race
counts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
they
written
out
anywhere
we
can
see
them?
or
are
there
articles
on
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
how
is
race
used?
do
the
administrators
have
discretion
in
the
weight
they
will
give
to
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
how
to
ask
the
question:
is
it
used
fairly
evenly
across
the
board
when
it
is
the
tiebreaker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
tip
the
tipping
point,
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
means...
that
leads
to
the
question
of
why
do
they
need
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
symbolic
that
race
counts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated
i
have
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
it
seems
appropriate
to
summarize
that
opinion
very
briefly.
the
nation’s
schools
strive
to
teach
that
our
strength
comes
from
people
of
different
races,
creeds,
and
cultures
uniting
in
commitment
to
the
freedom
of
all.
in
these
cases
two
school
districts
in
different
parts
of
the
country
seek
to
teach
that
principle
by
having
classrooms
that
reflect
the
racial
makeup
of
the
surrounding
community.
that
the
school
districts
consider
these
plans
to
be
necessary
should
remind
us
our
highest
aspirations
are
yet
unfulfilled.
but
the
solutions
mandated
by
these
school
districts
must
themselves
be
lawful.
it
is
well
established
that
when
a
government
policy
is
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
that
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
racial
classifications
are
narrowly
tailored
measures
that
further
compelling
governmental
interest
that
jefferson
county
in
its
briefing
has
explained
how
and
when
it
employs
these
classifications
only
in
terms
so
broad
and
imprecise
that
they
cannot
withstand
strict
scrutiny.
it
fails
to
make
clear
for
example,
who
makes
the
decisions?
what
if
any
oversight
is
employed;
the
precise
circumstances
in
which
an
assignment
decision
will
or
will
not
made
on
the
basis
of
race
or
how
it
is
determined
which
of
two
similarly
situated
children
will
be
subjected
to
a
given
race-based
decision.
when
a
court
subjects
governmental
action
to
strict
scrutiny
it
cannot
construe
ambiguities
in
favor
of
the
government.
as
for
the
seattle
case
the
school
district
has
failed
to
explain
why
in
a
district
compose
of
a
diversity
races
with
only
a
minority
of
the
students
classified
as
“white”,
it
is
employed
the
crude
racial
categories
of
white
and
non-white
as
the
basis
for
its
assignment
decision.
far
from
being
narrowly
tailored
towards
purpose
this
system
threatens
to
defeat
its
own
ends.
the
school
district
has
provided
no
convincing
explanation
for
the
design
of
the
classifications.
for
these
reasons
i
concur
in
parts
i,
ii,
iii-a
and
iii-c
of
the
court’s
opinion.
my
further
respectful
submission
however
is
that
parts
of
the
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
imply
on
all
two
unyielding
insistence
that
race
cannot
be
a
factor
in
instances
when
in
my
view
it
may
be
taken
into
account.
the
plurality
opinion
is
too
dismissive
of
the
legitimate
interest
government
has
in
ensuring
all
people
have
equal
opportunity
regardless
of
their
race.
the
plurality
opinion
is
at
least
open
to
the
interpretation
that
the
constitution
requires
school
districts
to
ignore
the
problems
of
de
facto
desegregation
in
schooling
and
i
cannot
endorse
that
conclusion.
if
school
authorities
are
concerned
that
the
student-body
compositions
of
certain
schools
interfere
with
the
objective
of
offering
an
equal
educational
opportunity
to
all
of
their
students
they
are
free
to
devise
race-conscious
measures
to
address
the
problem
in
a
general
way
and
without
treating
each
student
in
different
fashion
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
systematic,
individual
typing
by
race.
now
the
descent
on
the
other
hand
rest
on
the
assumptions
that
these
sweeping
race
base
classifications
of
persons
are
permitted
by
existing
precedents
and
that
its
own
confident
endorsement
of
race
categories
for
each
child
in
a
large
segment
of
the
community
presents
no
danger
to
individual
freedom
in
other
prospective
realms
of
government
regulation
and
that
the
racial
classification
used
here
cause
no
hurt
or
anger
of
the
types
of
the
constitution
prevents
in
each
of
these
premises,
in
my
respectful
view,
is
incorrect.
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
a
dissent
rational
were
accepted,
congress,
assuming
an
otherwise
proper
exercise
of
its
spending
power
or
its
authority,
or
its
commerce
power
could
mandate
either
the
seattle
or
the
jefferson
county
plans
nationwide.
there
seems
to
be
no
principle
rule
moreover
to
limit
the
descent’s
rationale
even
to
the
context
of
public
schools.
the
dissent’s
argument
that
if
race
was
the
problem
then
perhaps
race
is
the
solution
ignores
the
dangers
presented
by
individual
classifications,
dangers
which
are
not
as
pressing
when
the
same
ends
are
achieved
by
more
indirect
means.
to
be
forced
to
live
under
a
state
mandated
racial
label
is
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
individuals
in
our
society
and
governmental
classification
that
command
people
to
march
in
different
directions
based
on
racial
typologies,
assigned
to
individuals
can
cause
new
divisiveness.
now
that
statement
to
be
sure
invites
this
response.
now
sense
of
stigma
may
already
become
the
fate
of
those
separated
out
by
circumstances
beyond
their
immediate
control.
but
to
this
the
further
replication
must
be:
even
so
measures
other
and
differential
treatment
based
on
racial
typing
of
individuals
first
must
be
exhausted.
the
decision
today
should
not
prevents
school
districts
from
continuing
the
important
work
of
bringing
together
students
of
different
racial,
ethnic
and
economic
backgrounds.
the
compelling
interest
exists
in
avoiding
racial
isolation,
an
interest
that
a
school
district
and
its
discretion
and
expertise
may
choose
to
pursue.
likewise
a
district
may
consider
the
compelling
interest
to
achieve
a
diverse
student
population.
race
maybe
one
component
of
that
diversity
but
other
demographic
factors,
plus
special
talents
and
needs
also
be
considered.
what
the
government
is
not
permitted
to
do
absent
a
showing
of
necessity
not
made
here
is
to
classify
every
student
on
the
basis
of
race
and
to
assign
each
of
them
the
schools
based
on
their
classification.
