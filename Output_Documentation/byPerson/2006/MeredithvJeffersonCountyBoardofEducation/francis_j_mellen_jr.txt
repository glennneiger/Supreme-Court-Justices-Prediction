mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
story
of
a
community
that
once
maintained
racially
segregated
schools,
that
desegregated
those
schools
only
when
a
court
ordered
it,
and
that
today
maintains
racially
integrated
schools
with
broad
community
support.
this
case
presents
a
story
of
a
board
of
education
that
replaced
a
desegregation
decree
with
a
student
assignment
plan
that
works,
that
stopped
the
white
flight
that
was
the
result
of
the
desegregation
decree
and
has
stabilized
enrollment
in
our
public
schools.
this
case
presents
a
success
story
and
it's
a
success
that
was
achieved
in
compliance
with
this
court's
strict
scrutiny
test.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
brown
is
very
much
distinguishable.
in
brown,
the
topeka
board
maintained
two
systems
of
schools.
and
admission
to
those
schools,
admission,
not
assignment,
was
based
solely
on
race.
that
stigmatized
the
black
children.
it
sent
the
message
that
the
white
race
was
dominant
and
superior
and
that
the
black
race
was
inferior.
that
caused
great
harm
to
those
black
students
and
this
court
properly
remediated
it.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
the
plan,
your
honor,
is
not
based
solely
on
that
supposition.
this
plan
is
based
on
the
supposition
that
a
school
that
is
racially
identifiable,
and
that
would
include
a
white
racially
identifiable
school,
does
not
provide
to
the
students
in
that
school
the
compelling
benefits
that
our
board
believes
are
presented
by
racial
integration.
the
compelling
benefits,
some
of
which
are
the
benefits
that
this
court
identified
in
grutter,
from
the
racial
diversity
that
was
a
byproduct--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--this
plan...
and
the
federal
courts
have
held
for
years
school
districts
do
have
an
interest
in
avoiding
white
flight.
and
as
i
said,
this
plan
has
prevented...
has
stopped
white
flight
and
has
stabilized
enrollment
in
our
schools.
but
this...
this
plan
was
adopted,
your
honor,
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
compelling
benefits
of
racial
integration,
some
of
which
this
court
identified
in
grutter,
some
of
which
the
district
court
found
were
not
present
in
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
case,
but
are
present
in
an
elementary
and
secondary
system
of
schools.
for
example,
the
district
court
found
that
this
plan
makes
our
public
schools
more
competitive
and
attractive
and
results
in
broader
community
support
for
those
schools.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
district
court
found
that
the
board's
motives
were
indeed
legitimate
and
that
there
was
no
basis--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
proper
for
the
courts
to
do
that,
your
honor,
but
the
other
issue
that's
presented
by
these
cases
is
whether
the
use
of
race
is
narrowly
tailored.
and
the
district--
court
found
in
this
case
that
it
was,
was
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
so
i
think
that
this
case
does
not,
your
honor,
present
the
hypothetical
that
you
suggested
and
in
other
cases
with
different
factors--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--you've
never
said
it,
your
honor
and
the
question
has
never
been
presented.
a
similar
question
was
presented
in
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
case.
and
this
court
held
the
use
of
a
racial
classification
to
satisfy
a
compelling
interest
and
in
a
narrowly
tailored
manner--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--that's
not
this
case,
your
honor,
because
our
board
asserts
a
different
compelling
interest.
the
compelling
interest
asserted
by
the
michigan
law
school
was
viewpoint
diversity.
a
different
kind
of...
it's
a
byproduct
of
that.
this
court
asserts
an
interest
in...
this
board,
i'm
sorry,
asserts
an
interest
in
racial
integration
and
we
believe
that
there
are
compelling
benefits
from
racial
integration
and
that
this
board
provides
them
to
all
students,
both
black
and
white.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
completely
inapplicable,
your
honor,
because
this
case
presents
the
same
basic
doctrinal
question
that
was
presented
in
grutter,
whether
a
government
agency
can
use
race
as
a
classification
with
a
compelling
interest
with
narrow
tailoring.
this
court
in
grutter
identified
several
benefits
of
racial
diversity.
some
of
those
benefits
are
presented
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
school
context.
and
we
have
additional
benefits
that
are
presented
by
racial
integration.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
think
it
could
be,
your
honor.
and
this
court
has
said--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
think
of
one
because
i
come
from
a
community
with
a
long
history
of,
of
not
doing
that.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
there
might
be,
your
honor,
under
those
circumstances
a
compelling
interest
in
doing
that.
the
question
would
be
whether
it
is
narrowly
tailored.
but--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--no.
no,
your
honor.
of
course
with
that
explanation,
i
do
not.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
would
certainly
think,
your
honor,
that
a
wise
school
board
would
use
other
methods
to
achieve
that
result.
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i,
i--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--well,
i
agree,
justice
breyer.
and
i
misspoke,
i
used
one
word
incorrectly.
i
said--
i
should
have
said
this
court
has
not
held.
i
agree
with
general
clement
that
swann
was
dictum,
but
a
very
strong
dictum.
and
we
do
think
it
applies
here.
dictum.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
it
is
indeed
a
different
case,
your
honor.
we
do
not--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--we
do
not
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
purpose
of
this
plan
is
to
remediate
past
discrimination
against
black
students.
this
plan
is
intended
to
provide
benefits
to
both
black
and
white
students.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
they
do
not,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
we
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
the
seattle
district,
as
a
unitary
district
this
case
needs
to
be
measured
against
whether
a
board
has
a
compelling
interest
and...
or
board
feels
quite
strongly
that
there
is
compelling
interest
for
the
racial
classification
that's
employed
in--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--we
think
it
is,
your
honor,
for
the
very
reasons
that
the
district
court
held
it
is.
the
district
court
addressed
each
of
these
points
regarding
narrow
tailoring
which
this
court
identified
in
grutter,
looked
at
them
very
carefully
and
concluded
that
it
is
narrowly
tailored.
one
of
that
issues
that's
already
been
discussed
this
morning
is
individual
consideration.
we
agree
with
the
position
that
the
circuit
court
took
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
in
a
situation
in
which
the
compelling
interest
is
racial
integration,
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
take
into
account
other
background
characteristics
of
students
other
than
their
race.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
the
school
district
has,
your
honor.
in
fact
this
plan
uses
those--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--magnet
schools,
your
honor.
and
with
respect
to
history,
your
honor,
it
is
somewhat
complex,
because
although
the
court
ruled
in
the
hampton
case
in
2000
that
the
degree
was
dissolved
then,
the
board
honestly
felt
beginning
in
1981
that
the
decree
had
been
dissolved.
and
so
the
board
in
1984,
1991,
1996
made
what
it
thought
were
voluntary
modifications
to
the
plan.
beginning
in
the
late
1980s,
the
board
began
to
introduce
more
choice
into
the
system
including
magnet
schools,
magnet
programs.
the
board
uses
race
neutral
lotteries
to
determine
enrollment
in
some
schools.
but
the
board
feels
and
it
feels
very
strongly
based
on
conversations
that
board
members
and
staff
people
have
had
with
other
school
districts
that
have
tried
race-neutral
measures
including
charlotte
mecklenburg,
wake
county
and
san
francisco...
that
race-neutral
measures
alone
will
not
do
the
job
and
the
experience
in
those
districts
indicates
that
they
will
not
do
the
job.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
starting
point
was
that
plan.
the
board
has
modified
it
considerably
since
then
to
make
assignments
more
stable
and
predictable,
to
make
the
use
of
race
more
narrowly
tailored.
it
is
in
concept
the
same
plan,
because
it
has
some
of
the
features,
but
the
board
has
added
many
features
that
that
plan
did
not
have.
the
1975
desegregation
decree
was
really
quite
a
blunt
instrument
and
that's
why
it
was
so
controversial
in
the
community.
that's
why
there
was
massive
white
flight.
this
plan,
this
board
has
very
wisely
modified
that
plan
to
make
it
much
more
acceptable
to
the
community
so
that
we
stopped
the
white
flight.
we
stabilized
our
enrollment.
we
have
a
community
now
that
very
broadly,
the
public
opinion
surveys
show,
that
supports
racial
integration
whereas
in
1975,
they
were
opposed
to
it,
sometimes
violently.
this
is
as
i
said
at
the
outset
a
success
story.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
and
that
would
depend,
your
honor,
on
what
this
court
said
we
could
not
use.
we
do
know
that
four
of
our
schools,
magnet
schools
are
now
not
subject
to
racial
guidelines
because
of
the
district
court's
decision
in
the
hampton
2
case.
one
of
those
schools,
central
high
school,
is
far
outside
the
racial
guidelines.
it
has
a
black
enrollment
of
about
83
percent.
at
two
of
those
other
magnet
schools
black
enrollment
has
declined.
it's
declined
by
about
by
about
a
third
in
two
of
those
schools.
and
that
is
only
in
the
space
of
a
few
years.
our
school
board
staff
has
conducted
some
hypothetical
scenarios
as
to
what
would
happen
without
the
racial
guidelines.
some
hypothetical
scenarios
involve
choice.
some
involve
purely
neighborhood
schools.
all
of
those
scenarios
show
substantial
resegregation,
particularly
in
elementary
schools.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
some
of
those
scenarios,
your
honor,
did
have
some
degree
of
choice.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
they
are
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor.
they
were
in
the
record
in
the
hampton
case,
so
if
you
read
the
hampton
2
opinion
you
will
see
that
the
district
court
included
a
lengthy
footnote
in
which
he
basically
summarized
those
scenarios.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
some
of
the--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--they
do
indeed,
your
honor.
those
surveys
were
surveys
by
the
university
of
kentucky
research
center
of
parents.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
it
was
fairly
evenly
divided,
your
honor.
one
of
our
expert
witnesses
said
that...
well,
both
of
them
said
that
they
were
quite
surprised
that
the
findings
were
so
positive.
one
of
the
expert
witnesses
said
that
unquestionably
this
is
a
community
that
values
diversity.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
that's
the
testimony
of
edward
kiefer,
your
honor,
from
the
university
of
kentucky.
he
was
responsible
for
the
survey--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's...
there
are
some
other
surveys,
i
believe,
that
include
the
entire
community.
but
i
think
you'll
see
in
the
record
some
that
are
parents
only.
i
would
like,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
to
respond
very
briefly
to
some
of
the
facts
concerning
joshua,
because
you
asked
about
that.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
that
ms.
meredith
moved
into
the
district
in
florida
just
when
she
showed
up
at
breckenridge-franklin.
with
respect
to
her
appeal,
in
fact
the
litigation
had
not
commenced
when
she
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
file
an
appeal.
the
stipulation
of
facts
says
that
she
did
not
apply
for
joshua
for
the
first
grade.
now,
ms.
bloom...
excuse
me.
ms.
meredith...
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
because
it
took
place
after
the
record
was
closed...
but
ms.
meredith
reapplied
for
a
transfer
after
joshua
finished
the
first
grade.
that
transfer
was
initially
denied.
she
appealed.
the
transfer
was
granted
and
joshua
does
now
attend
bloom.
i
think
that's
relevant
because
the
solicitor
general
made
an
argument
in
his
brief
that
this
plan
allows
the
student
to
be
trapped
in
a
school.
we
would
certainly
not
agree
that
an
assignment
to
any
one
of
our
fine
schools
could
be
a
trap.
but
in
any
event,
students
can
reapply
each
year
and
that
has
happened.
it
happened
here
in
the
case
of
joshua--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--i
don't
think
exactly,
your
honor.
race
is
used,
as
the
district
court
found,
really
as
the
final
factor,
a
tipping
factor.
residence
comes
into
play.
choice
comes
into
play.
lotteries
in
some
schools
come
into
play.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
we
don't
used
the
word
"tiebreaker",
your
honor.
the
record
indicates--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--the
record
indicates
that
race
would
be
the
dispositive
factor
in
no
more
than
2
to
3
percent
of
the
choice
applications.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
think
they
need
it,
your
honor,
because
it
sets
a
boundary.
it
defines
what
racial
integration
means.
if
staff
had
come
to
this
board
with
a
plan
that
said,
our
goal
is
racial
integration--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it
simply
sets
the
outer
limits
within
which
our
process
of
choice
and
other
methods
of
assignment
works.
without
that
boundary,
it
could
be
transgressed
one
student
at
a
time.
the
guidelines
i
think
are
very
much
like
the
little
boy
in
the
dutch
story
who
put
his
finger
in
the
dike
because
a
few
drops
of
water
were
coming
out.
he
knew
it
would
become
a
flood
eventually
if
he
didn't
do
that.
we
think
that
is
exactly
the
case
here,
that
without
these
guidelines
one
student
at
a
time
could
transgress
them
and
ultimately
we
would
have
a
resegregated
school
system.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
the
great
majority
do,
your
honor.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
university
of--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--black
and
white
alike,
in
large
numbers.
no
plan,
your
honor,
can
be--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--again,
your
honor,
the
university
of
kentucky
survey,
which
is
in
the
record--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--broke
it
down
by
race
among
parents.
it
asked
whether
guidelines
were
proper.
it
asked
whether
assignment
on
socioeconomic
status
would
be
preferred.
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
in
that
survey
and
i
think
you
might
find--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's
an
exhibit,
i
believe,
to
the
stipulation
of
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
no,
we're
not,
your
honor.
we're
not
challenging
standing.
we're
simply
saying
that
ms.
meredith
did
not
suffer
undue
harm
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decisions
and
that
parents
as
a
whole
and
students
as
a
whole
do
not
suffer
undue
harm.
there
have
questions
in
the
first
case
about
an
end
point.
i
might
address
that
briefly.
we
believe
that
the
use
of
race
in
this
plan
is
self-limiting
in
several
respects.
if
racially
segregated
housing
in
jefferson
county
continues
to
decline,
which
it
has
somewhat
since
the
1970s,
and
the
board
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
presence
of
racially
integrated
schools
during
that
period
contributed
to
that...
there
are
several
amicus
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case
that
set
forth
research
that
supports
that
conclusion.
if
racially
segregated
housing
continues
to
decline
and
if
this
plan
meets
its
purpose
of
diminishing
racial
stereotypes
and
promoting
better
cross-racial
understanding
throughout
the
community,
we
can
foresee
a
time
when
this
board
will
not
see
a
reason
to
use
this
plan
or
may
modify
it
further
to
make
it
even
less
restrictive.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
can't
predict
the
future,
your
honor.
i
can
say
it
could
be
shorter
for
another
reason.
that
is
that
this
plan
is
inherently
subject
to
democratic
review
by
elected
school
board
and
by
the
voters.
it
could
end
sooner
than
that
if
the
board
and
the
voters
change
their
minds.
i
can't
predict
whether
it
might
end
longer
than
that.
i
can
only
say
that
this
board
has
a
long
history
of
modifying
the
plan.
as
i
said,
they
modified
it
in
1984,
1991,
1996,
2001.
it's
in
the
very
nature
of
how
a
board
of
education
works
that
they
continue
to
tinker
with
things.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
i
wouldn't
limit
that,
limit
it
to
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
an
important
factor
are
racial
attitudes
in
the
community.
i
think
that
this
board
feels
that
the
plan
does
serve
to
ameliorate
racial
stereotypes,
promote
cross-racial
understanding.
our
community
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
in
that
respect.
we
do
have
some
racial
issues
in
jefferson
county.
but
we
believe
this
plan
helps
them.
and
in
the
future
a
board
may
look
at
our
community,
may
look
at
how
racial
relations
work
in
our
community,
and
may
well
decide
that,
even
though
housing
is
still
somewhat
segregated,
we
can
do
without
this
plan
or
again
we
can
modify
it
to
make
it
less
restrictive,
which
in
fact
the
history
of
this
plan
shows
that
this
board
has
done.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
does
not
have
fixed
temporal
limitation
of
25
years
or
10
years.
as
i
said,
that's
not
how
school
boards
operate.
but
it
is
inherently
subject
to
review
on
a
temporal
basis
because
each
time
we
have
a
school
board
election
the
plan
potentially
is
in
play,
and
it
could
be
modified
at
any
time
in
that
sense.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
up.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
--there
was,
your
honor,
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
francis
j.
mellen,
jr.
your
honor,
as
i
recall
the
sixth
circuit's
order,
it
said
that
no
judge
asked
for
a
rehearing
en
banc.
