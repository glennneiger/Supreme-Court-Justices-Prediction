justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
an
improvement
exactly,
but
maybe
from
the
constitution's
point
of
view.
that
constitution
wanted,
as
they
said
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases,
to
take
people
who
had
formerly
been
slaves
and
their
children
and
make
them
full
members
of
american
society.
and
part
of
that
was
that
the
state
couldn't
insist
that
they
go
to
separate
schools.
now,
the
question
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view
that
you're
being
asked
is
how
could
that--
constitution
which
says
that
this
is
intolerable,
that
segregated
school,
and
insist
that
the
school
boards
in
swann
and
elsewhere
take
the
black
children
and
white
children
and
integrate
them?
how
could
the
constitution
the
day
that
that
decree
is
removed
tell
the
school
board
it
cannot
make
that
effort
any
more,
it
can't
do
what
it's
been
doing,
and
we'll
send
the
children
back
to
their
black
schools
and
their
white
schools?
that
i
take
it
is
why
the
court
in
swann
said
explicitly
that
you
could
use
race
as
a
factor
in
the
public
schools
when
the
school
board
so
chooses.
now,
that's
the
general
question
that
i
think
justice
ginsburg
began
and
justice
souter
was
following
it
up.
and
i
would
appreciate
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
doubt...
you
have
little
doubt.
are
you
an
educational
expert?
i
mean,
the...
it
seems
to
me
from
what
i
read,
that
there
is
a
terrible
problem
in
the
country.
the
problem
is
that
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
school
districts
that
are
becoming
more
and
more
segregated
in
fact,
and
that
school
boards
all
over
are
struggling
with
this
problem.
and
if
they
knew
an
easy
way,
they'd
do
it.
so
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
exactly
the
only
way
to
do
it
or
not.
i
do
know
courts
are
not
very
good
at
figuring
that
out.
and
i
guess
that's
why
the
court
previously
has
said
it
is
primarily
up
to
the
school
district.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is...
i'm
trying
to
find
out...
i
understand
what
you
think
of
gratz.
we
can
agree
or
disagree
about
that.
but
the
overall
view
of
the
constitution,
that
interpretation
that
you
have
in
your
mind,
if
it
really
forbids
it,
no
use
of
race,
i
mean,
basically...
all
right?
think...
go
back
to
cooper
versus
aaron.
go
back
to
the
case
where
this--
court
with
paratroopers
had
to
use
tremendous
means
to
get
those
children
into
the
school.
that's
because
the
society
was
divided.
here
we
have
a
society,
black
and
white,
who
elect
school
board
members
who
together
have
voted
to
have
this
form
of
integration.
why,
given
that
change
in
society...
which
is
a
good
one...
what...
how
can
the
constitution
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
would
require
us,
the
judges,
to
go
in
and
make
them
take
the
black
children
out
of
the
school?
see,
my
objection
to
your
approach
to
the
constitution
is
primarily
a
practical
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
prepared
to
just
say,
all
right,
they
can
do
it
some,
just
be
careful
about
it?
how
far
will
you
go
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
we'll
do
it
some,
just
be
careful
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
you
say...
in
truth,
maybe
i
missed
it.
in
your
response
to
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you
said,
when
he
asked,
that
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
explicit
use
of
race
by
a
k
through
12
school
board
was
constitutional,
and
i
thought
the
court
had
explicitly
said
that
in
swann.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that,
that
justice
powell
explicitly
said
it.
i
that
chief
justice
rehnquist
had
explicitly
said
it.
i
thought
if
you
went
back
in
sense
to
the
slaughterhouse
cases,
you'll
find
in
1872,
this
court
thought
that
the
primary
objective,
the
primary
objective
of
that
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
take
people
who
had
been
formerly
slaves
and
to
bring
them
into
this
society,
and
that
all
of
phrases
of
that
amendment
should
be
interpreted
with
that
objective
in
mind.
i
mean,
it
didn't
say
that
explicitly
there,
but
it
seems
explicitly
and
implicitly
this
court
has
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
part?
because
i
think
the
solicitor
general...
i
hope,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth...
but
i
think
he
agrees
that
brown
held
out
the
promise
of
an
equal
education,
that
the
country
worked
for
35
or
40
years
to
try
to
get
a
degree
of
integration,
and
that
maintaining
it
is
important.
i
think
the
government
agrees
with
that.
they
think
this
case
goes
too
far.
and
in
that
i
think
he's
referring
to
narrow
tailoring.
it
isn't
narrowly
tailored
enough.
so
i
would
appreciate
knowing
why
you
think
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
john
paul
stevens,
justice
david
souter,
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
dissent.
more
than
50-years
ago
this
court
declared
racial
segregation
in
public
schools
unlawful.
since
then
school
districts
using
many
different
plans
over
many
years
have
tried
to
integrate
their
public
schools.
louisville
and
seattle
are
two
such
districts.
they
began
with
racial
segregated
schools,
they
sought
remedies,
they
try,
forced
busing,
they
fear
or
experience
white
flight,
they
faced
concerns
about
de
facto
desegregation
and
they
ended
up
with
plans
that
end
forced
busing
that
rely
heavily
upon
student
choice.
in
both
cities
all
the
students
choose.
the
majority
indeed
almost
all
of
them
received
their
first
choice
school
but
school
districts
efforts
to
keep
school
racially
mixed
for
example
in
louisville
the
school
cannot
be
more
than
85%
white
somewhat
similar
in
seattle.
those
efforts
mean
that
some
students
do
not
receive
their
first
choice
though
in
seattle
such
a
student
can
transfer
to
a
preferred
school
after
a
year.
these
plans
are
not
primitive
action
plans.
school
placement
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
student’s
merits;
the
schools
here
are
not
magnet
schools.
they
are
about
equivalent
students
preferences
over
the
years
have
varied.
the
plans
here
were
adopted
democratically
by
school
board
in
order
to
achieve
certain
ends,
ends
that
are
partly
remedial,
partly
educational,
partly
civil.
until
today
the
law
has
allow
school
districts
to
implement
these
kinds
of
plans.
the
majority
is
wrong
when
it
holds
the
counter.
in
a
long
dissent
indeed
it’s
twice
as
long
as
any
i
have
written
before.
in
that
long
dissent
we
explain
law
and
it
is
long
because
details
are
necessary
to
understand
what’s
going
on
here
and
why
the
majority
is
wrong,
we
holds
its
unlawful.
first
i
examined
history
in
detail
and
that
history
shows
the
pattern
that
typical
pattern
i
just
described,
segregation,
remedial
plans
with
forced
busing
white
flight
re-segregation
concerns
and
new
plans.
indeed
they
chose
that
original
of
these
plans
were
segregated
by
law.
these
cities
in
fact
seattle
was
sue
and
entered
into
a
consent
decree,
sued
on
the
basis
of
the
school
board
memo
in
1956
that
said
the
reason
these
schools
are
segregated
in
part
is
because
we
have
transfer
plans
that
makes
black
children
go
to
one
place
and
white
to
another.
there
was
no
court
decree
neither
was
there
a
court
decree
in
large
portion
of
the
south.
a
lot
of
them
segregated
voluntarily,
desegregated
voluntarily
there
was
no
court
decree
but
they
were
segregated
de
jure.
there
was
a
court
decree
in
seattle
anyway
compared
to
earlier
plans
the
present
plans
rely
less
upon
race
they
emphasize
student
choice,
they
seek
to
improve
the
conditions
of
all
schools
for
all
students
no
matter
the
color
of
their
skin,
no
matter
where
they
happen
to
resolve
so
that’s
the
history.
second,
if
you
look
at
the
law
in
detail,
i
think
what
you
will
find
is
it
makes
clear
that
ever
since
brown
this
court
has
consistently
approved
the
measures
like
these
before
us.
indeed
it
has
approved
measures
that
were
far
more
race-conscious
to
combat
the
harmful
separation
in
the
schools.
consider
for
example
what
this
court
has
said
in
swann
v.
charlotte
mecklenburg
written
35-years
ago.
i
am
going
to
read
it,
it
is
a
paragraph
“school
authorities
are
traditionally
charged
with
broad
policy
to
formulate
and
implement
educational
policy”
and
might
well
conclude
for
example
that
in
order
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
pluralistic
society
each
school
should
have
a
prescribed
ratio
of
negro
to
white
students
reflecting
the
proportion
for
the
district
as
a
whole.
to
do
this
as
an
educational
policy
is
within
the
broad
discretionary
powers
of
school
authorities”
and
that
case
isn’t
below
that’s
why
the
opinion
is
long,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
like
that
it
was
a
principle
of
law
upon
which
executive
branch,
legislative
branch,
judiciable
branch
built
10-20-30
years
of
approval
of
similar
kinds
of
plan.
indeed
the
case
has
and
i
think
here
everyone
of
them,
everyone
of
them
recognize
that
there
is
a
critical
equal
protection
clause
distinction,
a
difference
between
on
the
one
hand
exclusionary
racial
discrimination
that
seeks
to
divide
us
and
justice
thurgood
marshall
use
to
say,
“that
the
constitution
in
respect
of
that
kind
of
plan
is
fatal
in
fact”
there
is
difference
between
that
kind
of
plan
and
an
inclusive
race
conscious
plan
that
seeks
to
bring
the
races
together.
our
cases
whatever
the
language,
whatever
the
linguistic
test
have
always
read
the
clause
as
not
being
fatal
in
fact
to
that
kind
of
plan,
the
kind
of
plan
that
tries
to
bring
people
together,
they
all
read
the
constitution
as
granting
school
districts
significant,
practical
lead
way
to
adapt
an
inclusive
point
should
districts
decide
in
their
discretion
that
such
a
plan
if
i
can
paraphrase
justice
marshall
again
will
help
our
children
began
to
learn
together
with
the
hope
that
our
people
will
learn
to
live
together.
third,
as
long
as
we
keep
in
mind
that
the
law
is
distinction
between
that
which
excludes
and
that
which
seeks
to
include
then
whatever
linguistic
test
we
apply
the
plans
here
pass
with
flying
colors.
do
we
have
to
find
a
compelling
interest,
which
is
language
taken
from
grutter
that
was
the
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
michigan’s
affirmative
action
plan
for
admission
of
the
law
school,
do
we
have
to
find
a
compelling
interest?
here
the
school
boards
objectives
the
interest
include
efforts
to
eradicate
the
remnants
of
primary
and
secondary
school
segregation.
they
include
efforts
to
create
school
environments
that
will
provide
better
educational
opportunities
for
all
children.
they
include
efforts
to
help
create
citizens
better
prepared
to
know,
to
understand
and
to
work
with
people
of
all
races
and
backgrounds
thereby
furthering
the
kind
of
democratic
government
our
constitution
foresees.
if
an
interest
that
combines
these
three
elements
remedial,
education,
civil
if
an
interest
to
combine
those
three
is
not
compelling
what
was
it?
do
you
we
have
to
find
that
the
board’s
plans
are
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
those
interests
after
that
grutter
said
that
affirmative
action
case
will
approve
the
plan.
well
here
the
plan’s
limited
and
diminishing
use
of
race,
the
plan’s
strong
reliance
upon
other
non-race
conscious
factors,
the
history
of
their
development,
the
comparison
with
earlier
plans
and
the
lack
of
reasonable
evident
alternatives
to
gather,
show
that
these
plans
are
more
narrowly
tailored,
they
are
narrowly
tailored,
more
settled
than
were
the
plans
that
the
court
upheld
in
grutter
and
other
earlier
cases.
let
me
deviate
so
i
can
give
an
example
the
majority
says
at
one
point
that
seattle
and
louisville
have
failed
to
try
less
race
conscious
alternatives
and
justice
kennedy
gives
a
list,
i
will
read
you
the
list,
what
they
could
have
tried.
strategic
site
selection
of
new
schools,
drawing
attendant
zones
with
general
recognition
of
the
demographics
of
neighborhoods,
allocating
resources
for
special
programs,
recruiting
students
and
faculty
in
a
targeted
fashion
and
tracking
enrolments,
performance
and
other
statistics
by
race.
take
these
one-by-one,
building
new
schools
that’s
called
strategic
site
selection.
seattle
has
built
one
new
high
school
in
the
last
44-years;
their
school
population
is
diminishing,
how
is
that
going
to
work?
let’s
try
another,
drawing
new
attendant
zones
on
a
racial
basis
they
tried
that,
they
tried
that
both
in
louisville
and
in
seattle
and
it
worked,
when
it
was
accompanied
by
forced
busing,
something
i
don’t
think
anyone
wants.
what
about
allocating
resources
for
special
programs,
what
i
think
that
means
is
magnate
schools,
well,
seattle
and
louisville
have
tried
that
too
and
they
are
still
trying
them
and
they
have
worked
with
degree
but
never
alone.
what
about
recruiting
faculty,
ask
the
school
administrator
about
how
easy
it
is
to
solve
this
problem
by
recruiting
faculty?
what
about
tracking
enrolments,
performance
and
other
statistics
by
race,
oh,
i
am
sorry,
tracking
measures
a
problem,
it
doesn’t
cure
a
problem.
the
upshot
is
that
in
striking
down
the
plans
--
these
plans,
the
court
forbids
or
it
dramatically
narrows
the
leeway
open
to
the
school
districts
to
use
race
conscious
plans
for
inclusive
reasons.
some
members
of
the
majority
would
outright
forbid
that
use,
it
would
treat
the
equal
protection
clause
is
colorblind.
other
members
of
the
majority
impart
through
what
they
say,
but
more
importantly
for
what
they
do
striking
down
this
plan
would
withdraw
the
practical
leeway
that
we
have
previously
said
or
at
least
radically
narrowed,
that
leeway
that
we
previously
said
the
constitution
offers
those
who
would
institute
inclusive
plans,
regardless,
their
interpretation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
would
prove
to
either
always
or
almost
always
or
certainly
far
too
often
fatal
in
fact,
that’s
the
exclusive
variety,
fatal
in
fact
to
districts
who
seek
to
use
race
conscious
means
for
inclusive
ends.
fourth,
the
consequences,
race
related
controversy
at
school
districts
and
others
seek
to
unravel
the
meaning
of
today’s
several
opinions.
delay,
setback
in
bringing
about
racially
diverse
schools,
trying
to
deal
with
threats
of
de
facto
segregation,
trying
to
unify
education
in
communities
divided
by
poverty,
correlated
with
race,
these
consequences
are
serious.
the
conclusion
of
all
this
is
simple,
yesterday,
the
plans
under
review
were
lawful,
today,
they
are
not.
yesterday,
the
citizens
of
this
nation
could
look
for
guidance
to
this
court’s
unanimous
pronouncements
concerning
desegregation,
today,
they
cannot.
yesterday,
school
boards
had
available
to
them
a
full
range
of
means
to
combat
schools
that
are
segregated
in
fact,
today,
they
do
not,
and
there
is
more.
what
has
happened
to
starry
decisis?
the
history
of
the
plans
before
us,
their
educational
importance,
their
highly
limiting
use
of
race
all
these
and
more
makes
clear
that
the
compelling
interest
here
is
stronger
than
in
for
example
grutter
or
we
upheld
the
race
conscious
law
school
admissions
program.
they
are
more
narrowly
tailored
and
what
has
happened
to
all
those
cases
that
made
very
clear
that
in
the
context
of
a
k-12
public
schools
this
kind
of
program
is
constitutionally
permissible.
what
has
happened
to
swann
and
others
mcdaniel,
crawford,
harris,
school
committee
of
boston,
seattle

district
no.
1,
the
pluralities
logic
writes
these
cases
out
of
the
law.
it
is
not
awful
in
the
law,
it’s
so
few
of
so
quick
change
so
much.
what
of
respect
for
democratic
local
decision
making
by
states
and
school
boards,
for
several
decades
this
court
has
rested
its
public
school
decision
upon
swann’s
basic
view
that
the
constitution
grants
local
school
districts
a
significant
degree
of
leeway
where
the
inclusive
use
of
race-conscious
criteria
is
at
issue.
now
localities
will
have
to
cope
with
the
difficult
problems
they
face
including
a
de
facto
re-segregation
deprived
of
one
important
means
they
thought
would
help,
and
what
of
law’s
concern
to
diminish
and
peacefully
settle
conflict
among
the
nation’s
people?
instead
of
accommodating
different
good-faith
visions
of
our
country
and
our
constitution,
today’s
holding
upset
settled
expectations,
creates
legal
uncertainty,
and
threatens
to
produce
considerable
further
litigation,
aggravating
race
related
conflict,
difficult
problems
surround
race
relations
in
this
country.
the
people
of
this
nation
hold
in
good
faith
different
views
on
how
best
to
address
those
problems.
the
plurality
may
question
the
wisdom
of
the
district’s
approach
towards
improving
race
relations
in
the
public
schools
but
the
14
members
of
the
school
boards
in
seattle
and
louisville
hold
a
different
view
about
that,
about
how
to
include
children
of
all
races.
they
believe
that
their
way
will
work
better
to
bring
about
racial
inclusion
in
their
own
communities;
they
don’t
seek
to
impose
that
way
upon
other
communities.
the
constitution
does
not
dictate
a
single
answer
to
this
kind
of
question
rather
it
grant
citizens
considerable
freedom
to
debate
and
develop
solutions
for
themselves
and
this
court
should
leave
them
free
to
do
just
that,
and
what
about
the
long
history
and
moral
vision
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
embodies.
the
plurality
cites
in
support
those
who
argued
in
brown
against
segregation
and
some
compare
the
approach
i
have
taken
to
that
of
segregation’s
defenders,
but
historic
these
segregations
did
not
simply
tell
schoolchildren
as
the
plurality
suggest
“where
they
could
and
could
not
go
to
school
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin”
that
wasn’t
all
what
was
happening,
that
wasn’t
what
segregation
just
was.
it
was
about
a
caste
system
rooted
in
the
institutions
of
slavery
and
80-years
of
legalized
subordination.
the
history’s
lesson
is
not
that
efforts
to
continue
racial
segregation
are
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
efforts
to
achieve
racial
integration
and
it
is
a
cruel
distortion
of
that
history
to
compare
topeka,
kansas,
in
the
1950’s
louisville
and
seattle
in
the
modern
day,
to
equate
the
plight
of
linda
brown
who
was
ordered
to
attained
the
jim
crow
school
to
the
circumstances
a
petitioner
joshua
mcdonald
whose
transfer
request
to
a
school
closer
to
home
was
indeed
initially
declined,
let
alone
the
seattle
student
who
has
to
spent
a
single
year
at
a
school
he
doesn’t
prefer.
i
am
not
saying
there
is
nothing
policy
speaking
but
the
problem
of
choosing
everyone
by
race.
there
is
a
cost
in
applying
a
state-mandated
racial
label.
there
are
many
cost
listed
in
the
majority
and
pluralities
opinions,
but
i
am
saying
that
those
costs
do
not
approach
in
degree
or
in
kind,
the
terrible
harms
of
slavery,
the
resulting
caste
system
and
80-years
of
racial
segregation.
finally,
what
of
the
hope
and
promise
of
brown?
for
much
of
this
nations
history
the
races
remained
divided.
it
wasn’t
that
long
ago
that
people
of
different
races
drank
from
separate
fountains,
rode
on
separate
buses,
studied
in
separate
schools.
in
this
court’s
finest
hour,
brown
vs.
board
of
education
challenged
that
history
and
helped
to
change
it.
for
brown
held
out
a
promise,
it
was
a
promise
embodied
in
three
amendments
designed
to
make
citizens
of
former
slaves.
it
was
the
promise
of
true
racial
equality,
not
as
a
matter
of
fine
words
on
paper,
but
as
a
matter
of
everyday
life
the
nation’s
citizens
and
schools.
it
was
about
the
nature
of
democracy
that
must
work
for
all
americans.
it
sought
one
law,
one
nation,
one
people,
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
legal
principle
but
in
terms
of
how
we
actually
live
our
lives.
not
everyone
welcomed
that
decision,
three
years
after
it
governor
of
arkansas
ordered
state
militia
to
block
the
doors
of
a
white
schoolhouse
so
that
black
school
children
could
not
enter.

the
united
states
dispatched
the
101st
airborne
little
rock,
and
federal
troops
were
needed
to
enforce
that
desegregation
decree.
today,
almost
50-years
later,
attitudes
towards
race
in
this
nation
have
changed
dramatically.
no
airborne
division
many
parents
white
and
black
alike,
maybe
almost
all
alike
want
their
children
to
attained
schools
with
children
of
different
races.
indeed
the
very
school
districts
that
once
spurned
integration
now
strive
for
it.
the
long
history
of
their
efforts
reveals
the
complexity
and
difficulties
they
have
faced.
and
in
light
of
those
challenge
they
here
ask
us
not
to
take
from
their
hands
the
instruments
that
they
have
used
to
rid
their
schools
racial
segregation
instruments
that
they
believe
are
still
necessary
to
overcome
the
problems
of
cities
that
are
divided
by
race
and
poverty.
plurality
would
decline
their
modest
request.
the
plurality
is
wrong
to
do
that.
last
half-century
has
witnessed
great
strides
towards
racial
equality.
we
have
not
yet
realized
the
promise
of
brown.
to
invalidate
the
plans
under
review
here
is
to
threaten
the
promise
of
brown.
the
plurality’s
position
not
intended
that
i
fear
would
break
that
promise.
this
is
a
decision
that
the
court
and
the
nation
will
come
to
regret,
i
must
dissent.
