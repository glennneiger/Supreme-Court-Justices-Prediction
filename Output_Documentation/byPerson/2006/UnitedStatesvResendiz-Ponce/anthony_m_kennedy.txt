justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
if
this
works,
but
at
the
trial
before
a
petit
jury
there's
an
opportunity
for
counsel
to
object.
there
isn't
an
opportunity
to
object
when
the
grand
jury
indictment
comes
down.
now,
i
guess
you
could
move
to
quash.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
same
problem.
it's
such
a
difficult
requirement
to
get
a
hold
of.
i
mean,
he
drives
the
car,
he
walks,
he
breathes.
i
mean,
all
of
these
things
enable
him
to
get
into
the
country.
i
just
don't
understand
the
basis
for
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
wasn't
forced
to
go
over.
he
did
it
on
his
own.
it
seems
to
me
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
would
that
be
here?
that
he
drove
the
car
to
the
border?
that
he
got
out
of
the
car?
that
he
presented
a
document?
what...
if
you
could
do
it
over
again,
what
would
the
indictment
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
just
a
metaphysical
inquiry,
when
is
an
indictment
not
an
indictment?
it's
not
some
other
standard
of
what's
fundamentally
unfair
or,
from
the
sixth
amendment,
whether
or
not
there's
notice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
poetic,
i
said
metaphysical.
when
is
an
indictment
not
an
indictment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
not
sure
of
your
test.
it's
whether
or
not
it's
fundamentally
unfair,
whether
or
not
there's
notice,
which
sounds
like
more
sixth
amendment
than
fifth.
or
whether
it's
not
an
indictment,
a
rose
is
a
rose
type
of
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
petit
jury.
and
in
neder
we
use
the
harmless
error
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can't
you
allege
that
the
means
by
which
it
was
done
are
unknown,
but
that
it
was
by
one
or
more
of
the
following?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
come
back
and
you
tell
justice
breyer,
well,
that's
because
we
had
no
notice.
but
that's
a
different
argument
than
the
fact
that
there
was
no
indictment.
notice
can
be
cured
by
a
bill
of
particulars,
by
the
fact
that
you've
had
a
chance
to
contest
the
evidence
at
trial,
that
there
was
no
error.
that's
a
quite
different
rationale
than
saying
that
this
is
not
an
indictment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
your
argument,
not
lack
of
notice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
concede
there
was
an
error,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
us
from
saying
we
don't
accept
that
concession,
and
have
you
rebrief
and
argue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
overt
act
is
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
do
that
in
the
face
of
your
concession
without
having
reargument?
