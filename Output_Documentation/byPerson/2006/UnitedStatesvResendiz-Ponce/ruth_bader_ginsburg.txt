justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
concede
that
the
error
would
always
be
harmless
if
you
have
a
trial
before
a
petit
jury,
and
all
of
the
elements
are
instructed
to
be
found
by
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
u.s.
attorney
in
this
case
oppose
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
making
the
concession
only
for
purposes
of
this
case.
that
is,
in
another
case
you
would
be
free
to
say
the
word
"attempt"
is
good
enough;
you
don't
have
to
spell
out
in
the
indictment
a
particular
overt
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know...
do
we
have
the
grand
jury
transcripts,
so
do
we
know
that,
in
fact,
evidence
was
put
before
the
grand
jury
that
false
identifications
were
presented
at
the
border?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
distinguish
the
mail...
the
letter
carrier
case
that
justice
breyer
posed,
because
there
you
said
even
though
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
of
what
this
person
was,
if
the
petit
jury
found
it,
that
would
not
be
subject
to
review.
i
don't
think
you
answered
justice
breyer
and
he
said
if
you
concede
that,
the
failure
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
this
person
was
a
letter
carrier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
you,
were
you
surprised
at
trial
by
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
submitted
two
false
identifications?
was
the
first
time
you
heard
about
that
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
were
you,
was
there
any
element
of
surprise
in
this
trial?
did
you
not
know
beforehand
that
the
government
was
going
to
present
evidence
of
two
false
identifications?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
was
no
lack
of
notice;
there
was
no
surprise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
surely
submitting
false
identification
could
be
a
overt
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
knew
that...
you
had
the
file.
you
knew
the
government
was
going
to
prove
this.
and
you
also
knew
it
was
an
overt
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
government
have
to
pick
one
overt
act
and
say
that's
it,
when
it
introduces
evidence
of
a
whole
string
of
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
this
indictment
charged
not
an
attempt
to
enter,
but
unlawful
entry.
then
the
indictment
would
be
sufficient,
right?
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
with
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
charged,
not
an
attempt,
but
an
unlawful
entry.
anything
missing
from
the
indictment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
substantive
offense
is
one
thing.
lesser
included,
i
think
you
said
earlier
it
couldn't
be
a
lesser
included
because
it's
subject
to
the
same
punishment.
so
it
is
not
lesser?
