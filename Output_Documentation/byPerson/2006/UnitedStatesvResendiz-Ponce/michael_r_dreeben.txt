mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
neder
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
omission
of
an
offense
element
from
petit
jury
instructions
can
be
harmless
error,
even
though
that
omission
violates
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
our
submission
is
that
the
same
analysis
applies
to
the
omission
of
an
offense
element
from
a
grand
jury's
indictment.
such
an
error
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it
is
harmless
when
the
petit
jury,
having
been
properly
instructed
on
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
returns
a
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
parties
do
move
to
dismiss
indictments
for
failure
to
allege
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
that
happened
here.
the
motion
was
erroneously
denied
by
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge,
under
ninth
circuit
law,
under
the
assumption
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
properly
interpreted
the
law,
should
have
concluded
that
this
indictment
failed
to
allege
the
substantial
step
that
was
part
of
the
attempt.
and
if
the
judge
had
done
that,
then
the
government
would
have
gotten
back
to
the
grand
jury
and
obtained
a
superseding
indictment.
instead
what
the
judge
did
was
deny
the
motion,
finding
that
the
indictment
itself
was
sufficient,
and
then
instructed
the
jury
on
all
of
the
elements
that
the
ninth
circuit
requires
as
part
of
this
offense.
and
so
we
have
now
a
petit
jury
verdict
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
finding
that
the
attempt
did
involve
a
substantial
step
towards
the
completion
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
first
of
all,
justice
souter,
motions
like
this
are
typically
made
long
in
advance
of
trial,
as
this
one
was.
waiting
until
the
day
of
trial
is
far
from
the
optimum
practice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
what
it
reinforces
is
that
the
judge
has
enough
time
to
look
at
it
and
conscientiously
attempt
to
get
the
law
right
without
the
need
for
the
court
to
apply
the
heavy
hand
of
automatic
reversal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my
response,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
same
response
that
this
court
gave
in
united
states
versus
mechanik,
where
it
was
confronted
with
an
analogous
problem.
and
that
was
in
that
case,
a
violation
of
the
rule
that
allowed
two
witnesses
to
testify
at
the
same
time
before
the
grand
jury.
and
the
court
was
specifically
confronted
with
the
question:
was
this
harmless
error
because
the
petit
jury
has
now
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
and
it
answered
that
question
yes.
and
en
route
to
that
answer,
it
said,
we
could
logically
be
persuaded
that
what
we're
supposed
to
do
is
compare
the
evidence
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
to
the
error
and
see
whether
the
error
was
prejudicially
consequential
for
the
grand
jury's
decision.
but
we're
not
going
to
do
that,
the
court
explicitly
said
in
mechanik,
because
once
there
is
a
finding
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
question
of
probable
cause
is
shown
a
fortiori
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
scalia,
the
district
court
should
decide
this
question
in
advance
of
trial
when
it's
properly
raised
and,
if
the
indictment
is
defective,
dismiss
it.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
trial
judges
don't
need
incentives
of
an
automatic
reversal
rule
to
get
them
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
i
want
to
amend--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
this
case?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
and
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
that
this
indictment
was
defective
was
really...
bolt
out-of-the-blue
might
be
too
strong.
but
it
was
an
extension
of
its
prior
precedents
in
a
way
that
wasn't
directly
foreseeable.
the
united
states
attorney's
office
had
every
reason
to
believe,
based
on
language
in
prior
ninth
circuit
cases,
that
alleging
an
attempt
to
enter
was
adequate
to
allege
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
alito--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
did
not
challenge
in
our
certiorari
petition,
which
this
court
granted,
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
that
in
order
for
an
attempt
to
be
accomplished
there
needs
to
be
a
substantial
step,
and
in
an
indictment
under
section
1326,
there
needs
to
be
an
allegation
of
what
that
substantial
step
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
is
common
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that's
certainly
the
government's
position,
justice
kennedy.
but
it
is
well
settled
in
the
common
law
that
attempts
require
a
substantial
step
towards
the
completion.
there
are
variations
that
different
jurisdictions
use.
that's
the
model
penal
code
formulation.
the
ninth
circuit
i
think
has
gone
beyond
where
some
other
courts
have
gone,
as
justice
alito
was
noting,
by
saying
that
the
indictment
needs
to
spell
out
the
factual
basis
for
that
substantial
step.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
indictment
would
have
to
say
that
he
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
and
took
a
substantial
step
towards
the
completion
of
that
crime,
to
wit
he
approached
the
border
and
came
to
the
guard
and
presented
false
identifications
to
the
guard
and
lied
about
his
intended
destination.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
alito,
i'm
not
going
to
defend
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here,
but
i
will
be
clear
about
the
following:
there
is
a
generic
legal
issue
at
stake
in
this
case
that
we
face
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
other
courts
around
the
country
because
indictments
are
not
always
written
perfectly.
and
whether
it's
an
element
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
improperly
read
into
it
or
an
element
that
a
court
has
properly
read
into
a
statute,
we
do
face
the
situation
where--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
did,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
didn't
really
have
a
lot
of
choice
about
it.
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
to
read
the
statute
this
way
and
it
reversed
the
conviction.
there's
not
a
circuit
split
under
section
1326.
we
have
to
bring
thousands
of
indictments
in
the
ninth
circuit,
so
we're
not
exactly
going
to
set
up
test
cases
to
risk
our
convictions
based
on
the
ninth
circuit's
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
unusual
for
this
court
to
decide
a
case
where
the
government
does
not
challenge
the
underlying
constitutional
ruling
and
make
some
remedial
argument.
two
very
notable
examples
are
united
states
versus
leon,
where
the
government
did
not
challenge
the
underlying
fourth
amendment
claim
that
was
found
to
be
valid
by
the
lower
court,
but
instead
simply
asked
for
a
modification
of
the
exclusionary
rule;
and
another
example
is
rose
versus
clark,
which
involves
a
fairly
analogous
issue
to
this
one,
whether
it
can
be
harmless
error
to
fail
to
incorporate
into
the
jury
instructions
the
actual
element
and
instead
rely
on
a
mandatory
rebuttable
presumption.
in
that
case
the
state
did
not
challenge
whether
the
instruction
violated
the
constitution.
this
court
didn't
decide
it.
instead,
what
it
decided
was
the
remedial
question
of
harmless
error,
which
is
an
important
question
and
i
submit
doesn't
change
in
character
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
underlying
error.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
may
have
a
different
atmosphere,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
has
any
different
legal
analysis
behind
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
our
fundamental
submission
here
is
that
with
respect
to
the
probable
cause
determination,
there
is
no
prejudice
because
of
the
petit
jury's
verdict.
with
respect
to
notice,
we
would
acknowledge
that
a
defendant
could
argue
that
the
defect
in
a
grand
jury
indictment
in
a
particular
case
could
fail
to
give
him
adequate
notice
such
that
he
might
have
a
case-specific
claim
of
prejudice
and
be
able
to
overturn
the
conviction.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
would
not
be
a
very
strong
argument.
there
really
is
no
reason
to
think
that
there
was
any
notice
problem
with
this
very
discrete
transaction
which
was
alleged
in
the
indictment
as
occurring
on
a
particular
date
in
a
particular
place.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
an
empirical
perspective
might
be
helpful
here.
and
i
think
an
empirical
perspective,
if
you
look
around
the
circuits
and
you
see
the
number
of
issues,
cases,
in
which
this
issue
is
raised,
it
becomes
clear
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
situations
in
which
mistakes
get
made.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
federal
system
here
in
which
70
to
80,000
cases
are
indicted
a
year.
mistakes
will
happen,
and
they
will
happen
both
by
the
trial
judge
and
by
the
prosecutor.
and
there
will
be
situations
in
which
the
circuits
change
the
law
or
the
interpretation
of
the
law
after
the
decision
in
question.
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
that,
where
the
ninth
circuit
extended
its
prior
precedents
to
find
that
an
indictment
that
didn't
allege
the
overt
act
was
inadequate.
and
then
the
government
is
stuck,
and
the
rule
of
automatic
reversal,
which
the
court
may
appear
to
think
in
this
case
is
particularly
disproportionate
since
the
indictment
looks
fine,
functions
identically
even
if
there's
a
conceded
violation
that
every
member
of
the
court
would
say
yes,
there's
a
missing
element
here.
the
fundamental
problem
is
that
the
grand
jury
sits
to
decide
probable
cause.
it
does
not
decide
whether
the
defendant
is
actually
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
actually
do
not
agree
that
there's
any
stronger
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
grand
juries
didn't
indict
when
the
government
had
adequate
evidence
than
there
is
historical
evidence
that
petit
juries
did
not
convict
when
there's
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
both
instances,
you
can
point
to
historical
instances
in
which
grand
juries
and
petit
juries
played
a
role
of
in
effect
nullifying
when
there
was
adequate
evidence.
but
it's
clear
from
the
neder
decision
that
that
history
has
not
led
to
the
conclusion
that
this
court
cannot
evaluate
petit
jury
defects
for
harmlessness,
and
the
same
conclusion
ought
to
be
true
a
fortiori
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter,
experience
doesn't
show
that,
in
fact,
district
courts
don't
grant
these
motions.
they
grant
them,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
when
the
indictment
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
do
think
we
can
assume
that
article
iii
judges
are
a
hearty
enough
species
so
that
they
can
make
up
their
minds
and
they
can
rule.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
risk
here
that
judges
might
reserve
the
motion,
that
is
the
same
risk
that
the
court
fessed
up
to
and
acknowledged
in
the
mechanik
case,
where
in
fact
the
judge
did
reserve
the
motion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
given
that
this
issue
arises
only
when
you
have
a
petit
jury
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
seems
overwhelmingly
likely
that
any
grand
jury
would
have
found
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
grand
jury
transcript
is
not
in
this
record,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
court
adopt
a
rule
in
which
it
reviews
the
adequacy
of
the
evidentiary
showing
before
the
grand
jury.
there
are
important
values
in
grand
jury
secrecy.
they
will,
of
course,
be
compromised
at
the
trial
stage
if
witnesses
testify
and
the
testimony
is
turned
over
in
that
context.
but
more
important
than
the
practical
aspect
is
exactly
the
logic
that
the
court
used
in
mechanik.
the
point
of
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
to
determine
is
there
enough
to
take
this
person
to
trial.
once
the
person
has
been
taken
to
trial
and
been
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
we
know
that
if
the
government
went
back
to
the
grand
jury
it
would
be
able
to
get
an
indictment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far,
justice
alito.
i
would
draw
the
same
line
that
this
court
drew
in
the
midland
asphalt
case
where
it
was
looking
at
a
somewhat
analogous
problem
of
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
the
same
line
that
it
drew
in
neder
itself.
in
neder
the
court
said
if
the
judge
directs
a
verdict
of
guilty,
that's
an
impermissible
act
and
it
cannot
be
rendered
harmless
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
evidence
is.
in
the
midland
asphalt
case,
this
court
dealt
with
whether
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
created
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
and
it
does
say
"no
person
shall
be
held
to
answer
absent
an
indictment
issued
by
a
grand
jury.
"
and
the
court
said
if
you
have
a
defect
that
causes
an
indictment
not
to
be
an
indictment
or,
as
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
no
indictment
at
all,
or
if
you
have
a
defect
that
causes
the
grand
jury
not
to
be
a
grand
jury,
those
are
the
kind
of
fundamental
errors
that
would
give
rise
to
a
right
not
to
be
tried
such
that
you
could
take
an
appeal
before
trial,
an
interlocutory
appeal.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
same
kind
of
principle
would
apply
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
borrowing
the
language
from
the
midland
asphalt
opinion,
but
i
think
that
it
was
a
poetic
way
of
putting
the
point
that
if
you
don't
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--when
you
don't
have
one.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
could
push
the
logic
of
that
argument
that
far.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
just
as
in
the
neder
case,
you
could
say
that
it
would
be
harmless
error
if
a
judge
directed
a
jury
verdict
when
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
on
all
of
the
elements.
but
the
court
did
draw
a
distinction
between
those
two
situations.
and
i
think
that
it's
one
that
responds
to
a
kind
of
commonsense
view
of
how
fundamental
an
intrusion
is
there.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
chances
are
he
did
know
what
crime
he
was
accused
of.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
we
submit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
isn't
quite
like
that,
i
hope,
justice
breyer.
i
mean,
notice
defects
are
very
commonly
alleged
by
defendants
and
courts
know
how
to
look
for
prejudice.
they
know
how
to
say
whether
the
defendant
was
denied
an
opportunity
to
prepare
his
defense
or
misled
by
the
indictment
in
some
fashion
or
another.
and
that's
a
very
common
case
by
case
sort
of
prejudice
inquiry
that
fits
with
the
nature
of
the
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
what
you
get
are
cases
where
there
needs
to
be
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
it's
not
alleged
and
then
the
government
comes
up
with
proof.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
vast
pool
of
cases
in
which
defendants
would
validly
be
able
to
show
prejudice
from
lack
of
notice;
and
that's
because
we
do
have
many
other
means
in
the
criminal
justice
system
to
alert
the
defendant
to
what
he's
facing.
there's
discovery,
there's
the
opportunities
for
a
bill
of
particulars
to
be
filed.
those
are
the
kinds
of
conventional
harmless
error
inquiries
that
are
appropriate
when
you
have
a
claim
that
the
indictment
fails
to
give
adequate
notice.
but
what
is
not
appropriate
is
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
impose
a
rule
on
the
government
and
on
the
system
of
justice
that
says
we
will
automatically
reverse,
because
there
are
important
values
at
stake
here
whenever
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
is
contemplated.
and
this
was
true
in
the
mickens
versus
taylor
case
where
the
court
rejected
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
when
a
judge
didn't
ask
a
question
in
response
to
an
obvious
conflict--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
two
aspects
to
our
rule,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
claim
of
a
defective
indictment
goes
to
the
question
of
was
there
probable
cause,
that
error
and
that
constitutional
value
is
not
a
basis
for
reversal
once
a
petit
jury
has
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
same
point.
to
the
extent
that
the
defect
in
the
indictment
goes
to
inadequate
notice,
a
defendant
can
make
such
a
claim
post
trial
that
the
indictment
prejudiced
him
because
it
was
inadequately
framed.
but
that
should
be
done
on
a
case-specific
basis
rather
than
on
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
any
double
jeopardy
bar
to
reindicting
him
since
he
is
the
one
who's
challenged
his
conviction.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
a
substantive
offense.
it
is
an
attempt
offense.
i
wouldn't
necessarily
describe
it
as
lesser
included,
but
rule
31
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
does
allow
a
trial
judge
to
submit
an
attempt
offense
to
the
petit
jury
when
attempt
is
a
violation
of
the
substantive
law.
i
should
say
that
the
government's
position
is
that
there
does
not
need
to
be
a
separate
charge
of
attempt
in
the
indictment
in
order
to
permit
rule
31
to
operate,
but
there
is
a
circuit
split
over
whether
lesser
included
offenses
can
be
submitted
to
the
jury
unless
they
are
included
in
the
indictment.
so
we're
not
operating
under
a
uniform
rule
that
would
always
allow
us
to
do
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
which
way
the
ninth
circuit
goes
on
that,
although
i
could
hazard
a
guess.
[laughter]
the
problem
that
we
have
here
is
that
we
are
living
under
a
rule
of
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
at
least
one
other
circuit
that
forces
the
government
to
pay
a
tremendous
penalty
when
a
mistake
is
made
in
an
indictment,
and
it
does
happen.
justice
souter,
i
can
assure
you
that
judges
dismiss
plenty
of
indictments
for
failure
to
dismiss...
state
elements,
but
they
don't
get
them
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
government
is
often
quite
confident
that
it's
correct.
and
i
think
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
prosecutors
in
this
case,
you
can
see
why
that's
true.
but
there
are
myriad
rules
and
sub-rules
of
substantive
law
that
this
court
will
never
review,
that
require
the
government
to
conform
with
various
pleading
obligations.
they're
all
below
the
radar
screen.
but
when
you
have
a
rule
of
automatic
reversal
like
this,
they
jump
up
to
prominence.
and
the
reason
that
they
do
is
because
the
entire
criminal
justice
system,
victims,
witnesses,
the
judge,
the
prosecutors,
the
defense
bar,
jurors,
everybody
is
being
asked
to
go
through
a
trial
that
was
conducted
on
an
error-free
basis
by
hypothesis,
simply
because
there
was
a
mistake
at
the
charging
phase.
and
the
petit
jury's
verdict
we
submit
makes
it
clear
that
that
mistake
does
not
entitle
the
judicial
system
to
say
let's
throw
it
all
out
and
start
again
simply
as
a
prophylactic
mechanism.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
hope
that
if
the
court
does
not
choose
to
decide
the
question
on
which
it
granted
certiorari,
that
it
does
hold
that
the
ninth
circuit's
substantive
rule
of
law
here
is
incorrect,
and
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
indictment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oh,
i
think
this
court
can
do
anything
it
chooses,
regardless
of
the
government's
concession.
[laughter]
but
we're
not
conceding
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct.
we
simply
didn't
challenge
it
because
the
important
question
for
us
is
the
rule
of
law
on
harmless
error.
this
pleading
rule
is
something
that
we
can
comply
with.
it
may
be
wrong,
but
it's
something,
like
many
wrong
rules
of
law,
we
live
with.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
