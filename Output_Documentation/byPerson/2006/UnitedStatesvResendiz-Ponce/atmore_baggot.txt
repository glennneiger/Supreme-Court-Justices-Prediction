mr.
atmore
baggot
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
the
structure
created
by
the
constitution
of
this
country
provides
a
single
means
of
charging
a
person
with
a
federal
criminal
offense.
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
was
that
a
group
of
ordinary
citizens
would
take
time
away
from
their
families,
their
businesses,
and
their
other
concerns
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
have
been
met
by
a
government
prosecutor,
and
in,
in
a
few
words,
whether
a
trial
should
proceed.
or
not.
mr.
atmore
baggot
absolutely,
but
the
proceedings
before
a
grand
jury
are
secret.
we
never
know
what
happened
inside
a
grand
jury.
it's
a
closed
door
proceeding.
it
is
an
independent
body.
it
is
not
subject
to
any
appeals
or
reviews
by
the
trial
judge.
the
only
thing
that
we
know
what
happened
behind
those
closed
doors
was
the
document
that
emerges,
which
is
the
indictment
which
becomes
public
knowledge.
nothing
else
is
known
about
what
happened
in
that
jury
room.
now,
i'll
take
a
guess
as
to
what
happened.
the
government
told
the
grand
jury
that
the
overt
act
requirement
was
not
necessary,
or
perhaps,
i'll
take
another
guess,
they
stated
to
the
grand
jury
what
they
stated
to
the
district
judge,
that
the
indictment
does
in
fact
state
the
overt
act
when
plainly
it
doesn't.
mr.
atmore
baggot
i
believe
it
would
be
raised--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--oh,
can
you
win.
mr.
atmore
baggot
you
can
always
raise
it.
mr.
atmore
baggot
you're
assuming
somehow
the
transcript
has
been
disclosed.
mr.
atmore
baggot
the
doors
are
open,
they're
not
closed.
mr.
atmore
baggot
we
know
what
happened
and
basically
there's
zero
evidence.
mr.
atmore
baggot
your
honor,
the
history
of
this
court's
treatment
of
grand
jury
is
that
they
may
consider
any
evidence;
they
may
consider--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--i
believe
in
that
situation
the
petit
jury's
verdict
would
stand.
mr.
atmore
baggot
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
atmore
baggot
because
the
constitution
contemplates
that
the
grand
jury
be
independent,
that
its
decision--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--not
be
reviewed,
that
there's
no
appeal,
there's
no
review
process
for
what
the
grand
jury
did
behind
its
closed
doors,
whether
we--
open
the
doors
or
not.
mr.
atmore
baggot
sir?
mr.
atmore
baggot
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
clerical
error,
rule
36
gives
the
trial
judge
the
ability,
and
the
power,
and
the
authority
to
correct
an
error
which
is
purely
clerical.
i
refer
you
to
the
case
of
contreras-rojas,
which
was
this
exact
defense.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
i
believe--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--well,
rule
36
says
the
court
may
correct
clerical
errors
at
any
situation.
but
that,
your
question
presupposes
that
we
know
what
happened
in
the
grand
jury
room,
that
it
should
have
been
an
indictment,
they
intended
it
to
be
in
the
indictment--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--the
result--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--and
he's
found
guilty.
mr.
atmore
baggot
my
position
is
the
conviction
would
stand,
yes,
sir.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
the
grand
jury
is
independent.
there
is
no
review
from
the
grand
jury.
the
petit
jury
is
an
independent
institutional
body.
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
is
not
only
to
find
probable
cause,
rightly
or
wrongly,
but
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
is
also
to
select
the
charge.
and
specifically
since
your
decision
in
recuenco
versus
washington
that
sentencing
enhancements
are
to
be
treated
the
same
way
as
basic
elements
of
the
offense
to
be
charged
also,
the
grand
jury's
role
is
going
to
be
even
better.
my
position
is
simply
that
there
is
no
review
whatsoever
from
the
grand
jury.
if
you're
unhappy,
you're
a
defendant,
you're
unhappy
with
what
the
grand
jury
did,
you
say
there's
no
evidence,
you
go
to
trial,
you
get
acquitted.
that's
the
only
review
there
is
of
the
grand
jury
and
what
they
did.
if
there's
an
error
the
case
must
go
back
to
the
same
grand
jury
or
conceivably
another
grand
jury.
there's
no
jeopardy
at
that
stage.
there's
no
constitutional
complications.
and
the
government
is
free
to
go
back.
quite
frankly,
i'm
very
surprised
the
government
did
not
just
go
back
and
amend
the
indictment...
not
amend
it,
but
supersede
the
indictment
and
allege
an
overt
act.
the
basic
problem
we
have
here
is
that
there
are
so
many
acts
committed
by
everybody
which
could
be
in
furtherance
of
a
crime.
and
the
problem
is
going
to
trial
that
we
don't
know
which
act
the
government
was
talking
about.
they
told
us
in
motion
proceedings
that
the
entry
itself
was
the
overt
act.
but
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
that
cannot
be
an
overt
act.
so
possibly
mr.
resendiz
was
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
atmore
baggot
i
could
have
done
that,
yes.
mr.
atmore
baggot
but
bill
of
particulars
are
not
favored
motions.
and
what
is
to...
that
would
still
be
the
government
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
atmore
baggot
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
submit
that
the
prejudice
to
the
defendant
at
the
jury
trial,
the
petit
jury,
was
a
slight
prejudice.
the
real
problem
i
feel
was
on
appeal,
that
if
the
government
had
alleged--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--no,
i
knew
that,
your
honor.
mr.
atmore
baggot
in
our
court
we
have
complete
discovery.
they
copy
the
file
for
it
and
hand
it
to
us.
so
we
know
everything
they
know.
but
what
we
did
not
know
is
what
the
government
would
rely
on
as
their
overt
act.
they
said
it
was
the
entry
itself.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
that
cannot
be
an
overt
act,
because
it
simply--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--it
could
be.
but--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--it
could
be
an
overt
act.
it
could
be,
lying
could
be
a
overt
act,
tying
your
shoes
in
the
morning
with
intent
to
go
to--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--it
could
have
been.
but
there
are
many
acts.
mr.
atmore
baggot
he
was
entitled
to
a
grand
jury
as
an
independent
institutional
body.
and
the
problem
i
have
with
the
government's
point
of
view
is
that
it
places
a
judge
as
a
reviewing
authority
over
what
a
grand
jury
has
done,
regardless
of
the
standard
that's
applied.
and
of
course
in...
it's
a
rare
case
when
you
even
know
what
a
grand
jury
did.
mr.
atmore
baggot
there
are,
there
certainly
are
scenarios
under
which
they
would
have
indicted
him,
yes,
sir.
mr.
atmore
baggot
sure.
mr.
atmore
baggot
rule
7(c)(1)
of
the
rules
of
procedure
states
that
the
indictment
must
state
the
essential
facts.
it
need
not
be
a
memorandum
of
law
just
spelling
out
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
a
general
sense,
but
it
must
state
the
essential
facts.
in
the
court's
case
of
hamling
it
says
very
clearly,
the
language
of
the
statute
must
be
accompanied
by
such
statement
of
facts
and
circumstances
as
will
inform
the
accused
of
the
specific
offense
coming
under
the
general
description
which
is
charged.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
your
honor,
based
upon
your
hamling
decision,
i
believe
that's
what
the
court
said,
that
there
must
be
an
allegation
of
facts
under
the
decision
in
united
states
versus--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
functions
of
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
to
provide
notice
to
the
accused
of
the
exact
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
here,
clearly
we
knew
he
was
charged
with
1326,
with
attempting.
what
we
did
not
know
is
which
of
the
many,
many
acts
that
the
government
suggested
at
various
times,
which
of
the
many
acts
they
proved
at
trial,
would
be
the
overt
act.
as
i
say,
the
appeal
was
unfair.
it's
not
so
much
the
trial
was
unfair.
it
was
the
appeal
that
was
unfair.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
really
address
it
unless
they
tell
us
what
they're
talking
about.
and
i
would
point
out
as
of
today
the
government
has
still
not
identified
a
single
act
that
is
their
overt
act.
mr.
atmore
baggot
yes,
you
could.
many
times
in
conspiracy
indictments
they
will
allege
any
of
the
following
overt
acts.
mr.
atmore
baggot
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
because
that's
going
into
excessive
detail.
the
requirement
is
that
the
essential
fact--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--because
he
did
many
things
in
furtherance
of
the
attempt
according
to
the
government's
proof,
and
we
had
a
right
to
know,
to
have
notice
of
the
accusation,
what
is
the
government
talking
about?
mr.
atmore
baggot
the
essential
facts.
mr.
atmore
baggot
but
in
the
russell
case
they
said
that
you
have
to
provide
the
essential
facts,
what
was
the
nature
of
the
committee
hearing,
what
was
the
subject--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--well,
it's
not
an
indictment
because
it
did
not
allege
the
essential
facts.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
it
didn't
provide
a
notice
of
what
the
essential
facts
was.
those
are
overlapping
concepts,
certainly,
but
we
did
not
know
what
the
facts--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--that
presents
a
different
legal
issue
because
a
variance
means
they
alleged
a,
they
proved
b.
here
they
did
not
allege
a.
nothing
was
alleged.
mr.
atmore
baggot
between
a
variance--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--well,
when
you
have
a
variance
the
question
is
how
much
is
the
variance,
how
far
off
is
the
variance.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
he's
given
notice
that
he's
approaching
the
border
with
intent
to
commit
this
crime.
mr.
atmore
baggot
but
then
the
question
becomes
is
it
material,
is
the
variance
material,
is
it
far
off
from
what
alleged?
here
nothing
was
alleged.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
the
prime
variance
case
is
stirone
versus
united
states
in
the
1960s,
where
the
court
very
simply
said
that
where
nothing
is
alleged
this
cannot
be
treated
as
a
simple
variance.
mr.
atmore
baggot
right.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
the
extent
is...
it's
a
question
that
can't
be
answered
in
the
abstract.
it's
a
question
of
how
material
the
variance
was.
mr.
atmore
baggot
correct.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
your
honor,
our
case
is
simply
that
where
a
material
element
is
omitted
the
grand
jury...
something
went
wrong
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
the
only
remedy
for
that
is
to
return
it,
the
case,
to
the
grand
jury
and
let
them
have
a
second
go--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--constitutionally
deficient
and
did
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
atmore
baggot
that's
correct,
your
honor,
no
crime,
and
the
reason
for
that...
i'll
go
one
step
further...
is
because
there's
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
government--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--because
that
is...
there
must
be
facts
to
show
what
the
overt
act
was.
just
providing
a
legal
memorandum
of
what
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
doesn't
do
any
good.
what
the
constitution
contemplates
is
that
the
essential
facts
be
laid
out.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
if
it--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--no,
because
that's
a
general
intent
crime.
there's
no
specific
intent
and
no
requirement
that
he
perform
any
overt
act.
mr.
atmore
baggot
under
such
an
indictment,
under
this
case
he
could
not,
because
he
was
under
the
constant
surveillance
of
the
ins
at
the
time
and
in
law
that
is
not
a
legal
indictment,
not
a
legal
reentry,
an
illegal
reentry.
it's
one
of
those
quirks
in
the
law,
and
that's
why
they
charged
the
attempt,
to
avoid
these
questions
of
whether
he
was
under
the
constant
control
and
surveillance
of
the
immigration
authorities,
which
he
was.
he
never
got
by
secondary.
so
that's
why
the
charge
was
attempt
as
opposed
to
unlawful
entry.
mr.
atmore
baggot
no,
and--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--and
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
either
because
it's
not
a
specific
intent
crime
and
there's
no
requirement--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--attempt
is
not
a
lesser
included.
the
congress
has
intended
to
make
attempt
on
the
same
level
as
the
substantive
offense.
that
is
the
way
the
case
law
has
been
coming
out.
so
whether
he
enters,
whether
he
attempts,
or
whether
he's
found
in
the
united
states
are
all
on
an
equal
par.
it's
not
a
lesser
included.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
it
has
the
same
guideline
punishment.
it
has
the
same
treatment
as
the
unlawful
entry.
and
they're
treated...
we
have
case
law
in
our
circuit
that
says,
i
think
it
is
corrales
beltran,
that
says
the
attempt
is
a
substantive
offense,
even
though
it
sounds
contradictory.
mr.
atmore
baggot
if
he
was
charged
that
way,
they
probably
could,
yes.
there
could
be
a
two-count
indictment
or
there
could
be
alternatives.
but
that
wasn't
this
case.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
they
would
have
to
set
out
the
overt
act
and
the
essential
facts
that
constitute
the
overt
act.
mr.
atmore
baggot
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
atmore
baggot
normally,
yes,
sir.
mr.
atmore
baggot
that's
correct.
however,
in
this
case
there
is
a
peculiar
meaning
to
the
word
"attempt"
that
when
congress
used
the
word
"attempt"
they
meant
to
bring
with
that
word
its
requirements
under
the
common
law.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
they
do
and
they
don't.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
that's
why
they
had
an
en
banc
determination,
because
the
judges
were
in
disarray
over
that
question.
but
at
the
time
of
this
trial
of
the
en
banc
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
gracidas-ulibarry,
had
established
concretely
that
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
to
incorporate
the
common
law
meaning
of
the
word
"attempt".
mr.
atmore
baggot
no,
sir.
mr.
atmore
baggot
no,
but
here
under
1326
it's
quite
different.
the
intent
of
the
legislature
was
that
the
attempt
would
itself
be
a
substantive
offense.
mr.
atmore
baggot
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
atmore
baggot
well,
that's
a
good
point.
but
under
our...
all
i
can
tell
you,
justice
scalia,
is
that
under
our
case
law
the
attempt
is
considered
a
substantive
offense.
that's
been
the
law--
mr.
atmore
baggot
--under
this
statute,
under
1326,
that's
the
ruling
of
our
circuit.
your
honor,
in
conclusion,
i'd
just
like
to
emphasize
that
if
the
government's
position
is
adapted,
what
you
will
have
is
judges
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
grand
jury
whether
or
not
to
allege
certain
elements,
essential
elements
of
offenses.
that
is
challenging
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury,
which
is
part
of
the
structure
set
up
by
the
constitution,
that
the
grand
jury
is
a
separate
institution.
anything
that
the
grand
jury
does,
any
mistakes
that
are
made,
need
to
be
returned
to
the
grand
jury
and
not
be
reviewed
by
a
single
judge,
a
panel
of
judges,
or
an
en
banc
or
any
court.
are
there
any
other
questions
by
the
court?
mr.
atmore
baggot
thank
you,
sir.
