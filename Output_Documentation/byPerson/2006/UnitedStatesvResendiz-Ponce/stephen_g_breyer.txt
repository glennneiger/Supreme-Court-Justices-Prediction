justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
the
element,
i
thought
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about
was
overt
act.
they
didn't
use
the
words
"overt
act".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
i
thought
that
comes
out
of
conspiracy
law;
it
doesn't
even
out
of
attempt
law.
then
i
thought
it's
unlikely...
but
here
you
can
correct
me.
the
u.s.
code
is
filled
with
the
word
"attempt".
just
opening
it
at
random,
there
are
attempts
to
assault
and
steal
mail
matter,
there
are
attempts
to
steal
the
mail
matter,
there
are
attempts
to
rob
a
bank,
attempts
here,
attempts
there.
is
it
the
government's
practice
whenever
they
charge
a
violation
of
any
of
these
provisions
to
not
just
use
the
word
"attempt",
but
to
use
the
words
"substantial
step"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
the
answer
was
no.
and
therefore,
this
isn't
just
a
small
error
of
a
technical
sort.
the
ninth
circuit
is
completely
wrong
and
not
even
close.
and
therefore,
if
they're
not
even
close,
can
the
government
come
up
here
where
there's
an
obvious
error
and
they
decide,
the
government,
that
it
would
like
to
have
a
declaration
by
this
court
on
a
matter
that
they
think
is
quite
interesting
and
important
to
them
in
a
lot
of
other
cases
where
they
can't
win
the
cases
easily?
that's,
i'm
putting
it
a
little
pejoratively
because
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
see
what
i'm
driving
at.
it's
like
a
hoked-up
case.
why
not?
i'm
using
it
pejoratively
only
so
that
you
can
see
what
i'm
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
this
come
up
very
often?
i
think
the
case...
the
issue
you
want
to
raise,
because
i
would
think
normally
there's
a
motion
before
the
trial,
well
before
the
jury
is
empanelled.
the
defendant
says:
i
want
you
to
dismiss
this;
the
indictment's
inadequate.
and
if
that's
even
close,
i
would
think
normally
the
prosecutor
would
go
back
and
say:
fine,
i'll
get
a
superseding
indictment,
and
that
would
end
the
problem.
and
it
seems
to
me
so
likely
to
happen
that
the
chances
of
the
judge
wrongly
ruling
against
the
defendant
and
then
it
goes
through
a
whole
trial
almost
never
happens.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
an
indictment
have
as
its
purpose
in
part
to
tell
the
defendant
what
crime
he's
being
accused
of
committing?
isn't
that...
so
that's
why
i
thought
it
would
be
quite
clear,
wouldn't
it,
or
helpful
to
say
that
to
the
ninth
circuit?
and
so
an
error
is
when
it
doesn't
do
that?
and
an
error
is
when
it
leaves
out
an
element,
and
he
doesn't
know
what
crime
is
being
committed,
he's
accused
of.
so
suppose
you
had
an
indictment
that
really
did
that.
now
he
doesn't
know
what
crime
he's
accused
of.
and
then
you
go
to
the
trial
and
so
forth
and
now
we
have
to
go
into
at
what
point
did
he
work
out
what
crime
he
was
being
accused
of,
rather
hard
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
of
course
the
chances
are.
but
there's
a
possibility
he
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
he
didn't
and
therefore
the
indictment
was
faulty
in
that
respect,
then
what?
are
you
going
to
say
we
have
to
track
down...
i
mean
what
it's
reminding
me
of
is
like
trying
to
say
whether
he
got
an
adequate
lawyer,
didn't
get
an
adequate
lawyer,
who
knows,
that
kind
of
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--me
until
halfway
through
the
trial
that
it
was
robbery
i
was
being
accused
of
because
they
left
robbery
out
of
the
indictment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose...
suppose
we
found
out.
somebody
told
what
happened,
and
it
was
a
crime
of
bank
robbery
or
it's
an
assault
of
a
mailman,
a
postman.
and
you
know,
it
turns
out
they
didn't
present
one
word
of
evidence,
not
a
word
that
says
that
this
individual
who
was
assaulted
had
anything
to
do
with
the
mail.
there's
complete
absence
of
any
evidence
whatsoever
on
a
major
element
of
the
offense.
and
now,
suppose
we
get
finished
with
the
trial.
plenty
of
evidence.
conviction.
can
you
go
back
and
raise
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean
can
you
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
see,
i'm
saying
is
that
error?
is
that
correctible
error?
i'm
saying
there
is
an
absolute
error.
it
is
far
worse
than
here.
we
know
for
a
certainty
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
presented
to
the
grand
jury
on
a
major
element
of
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
assume
we
know
that.
take
that
as
a
given.
we
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
we
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
zero.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question,
yes
or
no?
i'm
saying
after
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right.
so
the
answer
is
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
can't
raise
that,
which
is
a
major
area
because
there's
a
harmless
error
is
what
it
really
amounts
to,
why
isn't
the
same
true
here
where
the
error
is
far
more
likely
to
be
simply
technical
and
make
no
difference
given
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
as
well
in
my
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can't
you
ask
for
a
bill
of
particulars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
you
would
have
had
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
separate
requirement.
i
don't
know
if
it's
constitutional
or
not
constitutional,
but
i
didn't
think
that
requirement
was
at
issue
here.
the
requirement
of
stating
the
facts
is
not
the
requirement
of
setting
out
the
elements
of
the
law.
at
least
that's
my
understanding.
now,
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
denying
that.
i
just
didn't
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
object
of
the
indictment
initially
was
to
set
forth
what
crime
the
person
was
accused
of
and
inform
him
of
that.
you
are
saying,
and
then
there
is
another
requirement,
which
seems
a
little
vague.
it's
been
hard
for
me
to
find
out,
to
pin
this
down,
and
it's
the
one
you
state,
which
is
that
it
says
in
addition
in
the
rule
you
have
to
have
facts.
i
don't
know
if
those
are
the
same.
i
thought
they
were
two
separate
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what
i...
i
tried
to
read
some
treatises
on
this,
and
the
more
i
read,
the
more
confused
i
got.
i
started
out
thinking,
well,
it's
sufficient
if
you
have
bank
robbery
you
say
on
october
14,
2004,
in
the
city
of
such
and
such,
at
the
corner
of
such
and
such,
where
there
is
a
bank,
the
defendant
walked
into
the
bank
and
he,
he
attempted
or
he
did
by
force
or
threat
of
force,
take
property
belonging
to
someone
else,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
and
that
you
don't
have
to
say,
and
in
addition
he,
you
know,
what
the
force
consisted
of,
did
it
consist
of
a
knife,
or
a
gun,
or
a
fist.
can
you
give
me
some
enlightenment,
at
least
if
you
think
that's
relevant
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
excessive
detail,
the
central
fact,
then
why
isn't
on
such
and
such
a
date
at
such
and
such
a
time
he
attempted
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
why,
if
that's
so,
why
wouldn't
that
apply
as
well
if
they
said
he
attempted
to
and
committed
an
overt
act
in...
that
is
a
substantial
step.
and
then
you're
saying
in
addition,
they
have
to
list
the
particular
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
couldn't
find
any
case
in
this
court
that
said
that.
i
mean,
i
found
in
hamling
a
case
that
went
the
other
way,
a
general
statement.
they
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
obscenity,
you
don't
have
to
say
how
obscene
or
in
what
way
it's
obscene,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
and
then
russell
seems
lost
from
sight
for
quite
a
while,
or
isn't
followed
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
it's
an
assault
and
the
indictment
says
on
such
and
such
a
day,
at
such
and
such
a
time,
he
assaulted
the
postman,
right?
you
also
have
to
say
what,
that
he
waved
his
fist
or
that
he
had
a
knife?
you
have
to
say
that
in
the
indictment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
all
right.
so
i
thought
normally
essential
facts
means
simply
the
facts...
you
can
state
the
essential
facts
by
writing
the
statute
and
normally
that
tells
you.
now,
is
that
true?
one
case
that
seems
to
go
the
other
way
is
russell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
normally,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
more
than
any
other
word
in
the
statute?
"attempt",
people
know
what
that
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
also
know
what
"assault"
means.
and
if
you
tried,
you
could
spell
out
"assault".
they
know
what
"robbery"
means,
but
you
could
spell
it
out.
so
why
does
the
ninth
circuit
think
this
one
you
have
to
spell
out,
but
all
the
other
words
you
don't
have
to?
