justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
this
touches
on
what
troubles
me
about
this.
i
wonder
whether
we
can
answer
the
generic
question
that
you
presented,
whether
the
omission
of
an
element
of
a
criminal
offense
from
the
indictment
can
constitute
harmless
error,
without
considering
the
nature
of
the
alleged
defect
here.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
answer...
if
you
look
at
whether
the
alleged
defect
here
is
susceptible
to
harmless
error
analysis,
or
whether
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
in
fact,
it
is
harmless,
how
you
can
answer
those
questions
without
reaching
a
conclusion
about
whether
there
was
any
defect
in
the
indictment
in
the
first
place.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
defect
in
this
indictment.
it
charges...
it
recites
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
uses
the
word
"attempt"
which
has
a
very
well-settled
meaning
in
the
law.
any
lawyer
would
understand
exactly
what
is
required
for
an
attempt.
it
sets
out
the
factual
basis
of
the
charge.
so
i
don't
know
how
you
would
get
to
the...
how
you
can
answer
the
second
question
without
getting
into
the
first
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
went
back
to
the...
if
you
went
back
to
the
very
demanding
nineteenth
century
criminal
pleading
laws,
criminal
pleading
laws,
they
would
say
that
where
you
use
a
legal
term
that
has
a
well-0established
meaning
such
as
attempt,
you
don't
need
to
spell
out
the
definition
of
that,
of
that
concept.
it's
enough
to
use
the
term.
so
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
is
to
resurrect,
you
know,
to
go
back
to
something
that's
more
demanding
than
would
have
been
required
in
a
nineteenth
century
indictment
and
frame
that
as
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
far
would
you
go
with
the
mechanik
logic?
suppose
that
someone
is
charged
by
information
with
a
felony
without
the
person's
consent
and
for
some
reason
the
trial
judge
refuses
to
dismiss
the
information
and
then
the
person
is
convicted.
would
you
say
that
because
the
petit
jury
returned
a
verdict
that
the
fact
that
the
person
was
charged
with
a
felony
by
information
calls
for
no
remedy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
perfectly--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
what
if
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
error
is
simply
a
clerical
error?
let's
take
a
case
where
somebody
is
charged
with
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon.
and
before
the
grand
jury,
we
look
at
the
transcript,
we
see
that
the
prosecutor
introduced
evidence
of
five
judgments
of
convictions
for
felony
offenses.
and
the
jury
is
properly
charged
that
they
have
to
find
that
this
individual
was
a
convicted
felon.
and
there's
simply...
and
then
when
the
case
is
tried
at,
when
the
case
is
tried
the
defense
even
stipulates
that
the
person
is
a
convicted
felon.
but
there's
a
clerical
mistake
in
preparing
the
indictment.
and
it
doesn't
recite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
previously
convicted
of
a
felony.
it's
your
position
that
there
must
be
a
reversal
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
it
comes
up
on
appeal?
nothing
is
done
until
it
comes
up
on
appeal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is
exactly
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
that
the...
that
the
indictment
had
to
specify
which
of
the
many
things
that
he
did,
or
the
several
things
that
he
did
when
he
approached
the
border
constituted
the
overt
act
that
the
ninth
circuit...
he
walked
up
to
the
border
and
he
did
a
number
of
things
to
try
to
get
into
the
united
states.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
think
that
the
indictment
has
to
specify
that
walking
up
wasn't
a
substantial
step,
but
presenting
the
documents
might
have
been,
whether
it
was
walking
up,
presenting
the
documents,
lying
to
the
agent?
you
have
to
go
into
that
level
of
detail
in
order
to
satisfy
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
defendant
could
be
convicted
of
an
attempt
under
such
an
indictment,
could
he
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
that
situation,
you
wouldn't
know
what
the
substantial
step
was,
would
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
indictment
wouldn't
tell
you
what
the
substantial
step
was.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
the
lesser
included
offense
of
attempt
under
an
indictment
charging
the
completed
offense?
