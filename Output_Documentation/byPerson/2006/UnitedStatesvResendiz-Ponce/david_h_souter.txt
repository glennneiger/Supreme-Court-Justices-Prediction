justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
problem
that
the
motion
to
quash
is
going
to
be
made,
if
counsel
is
on
his
toes,
is
going
to
be
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial?
and
we
want
to
induce
the
court
to
look
very
carefully
at
it
at
that
point,
because
if
the
court
is
wrong,
somebody
has
to
go
through
an
entire
trial
as
a
result
of
it.
and
the
way
to
induce
the
court
to
be
very
careful
at
the
beginning
is
to
say,
this
is
not
harmless
error,
and
you've
got
to
take
this
very
seriously
and
you
can't
take
any
chance
on
the,
in
effect,
the
evidence
saving
you
in
harmless
error
analysis
later.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sure
that's
right.
but
that
simply
reinforces
my
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
trouble
with
your
a
fortiori
argument
it
seems
to
me
is
this:
if
we
accept
your
argument,
then
whenever
a
judge
is
asked
to
rule
on
a
motion
to
quash,
if
the
judge
is
in
any
doubt,
the
judge
is
going
to
be
induced
by
your
rule
to
deny
the
motion
to
quash
and
wait
and
see
what
happens
at
trial.
and
if
in
fact
they
get
to
trial
and
they
don't
prove
the
element,
then
it
can
either
be
thrown
out
because
an
element
has
not
been
proven
or
he
can
go
back
and
revive
the
motion
to
quash.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
government
gets
its
act
together
at
that
point
and
does
put
in
evidence
on
the
element,
it's
going
to
be
harmless
error.
and
so
the
price
of,
it
seems
to
me,
of
your
rule
is
that
someone
will
always
be
put
to
trial
if
there
is
any
question
about
how
the
judge
should
rule
on
the
motion
to
quash,
whereas
if
we
go
the
other
way
the
judge
will
grant
the
motion
to
quash
and
the
government
can
go
back
to
the
grand
jury
and
get
another
indictment.
it
seems
to
me
that
something
is
seriously
lost
in
that
situation
if
we
go
your
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sure
they
do
grant
them.
but
i'm
concerned
about
the,
we'll
say,
the
doubtful
case
or
the
judge
who
can't
make
up
his
mind.
under
your
rule
the
price
of
that
uncertainty
is
always
going
to
be
to
subject
somebody
to
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prejudice
to
the
defendant
in
the
two...
as
between
the
two
situations
simply
is
not
comparable.
in
mechanik
you
had
a
situation
in
which
two
witnesses
putting
in
whatever
evidence
they
were
putting
in
were
in
the
jury
room
and,
yes,
one
could
influence
the
other,
et
cetera.
here,
we're
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
defendant
should
never
be
put
to
trial
at
all.
and
your
rule
says
if
there's
any
question
about
it,
put
him
to
trial,
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
point
is
not
that
there
was
any
prejudice
here.
your
point
is
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
grand
jury?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
isn't
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
in
the
case
in
which
there
is
no
allegation
of
an
element
at
all
there
isn't
a
sufficient
indictment
to
charge
him
for
anything,
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
variance
on
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
an
indictment
and
the
question
is
simply
whether
he
was
misled
by
the
variance
and
prejudiced?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
isn't
the
answer
is
in
one
case
there's
an
indictment,
and
in
the
other
case
there
isn't?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
isn't
your
answer
to
him
that
in
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
variance
you
have
an
indictment;
in
the
case
that
you're
talking
about
there
is
none?
and
the
reason
i
press
you
on
that
is
that
i
thought
the
essence
of
your
case
was
that
there
is
no
indictment
here,
i.e.,
the
grand
jury
function
has
not
been
performed
and
he
is
entitled
to
the
grand
jury
function
before
he
goes
to
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
is
the
nub
of
your
position,
then
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
was
what
i
suggested.
if
that's
not
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
then
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
result
of
what
went
wrong?
how
do
you
characterize
the
grand
jury
product
in
the
case
in
which,
as
you
put
it,
something
goes
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
an
insufficient...
in
other
words,
there
is
no
indictment
charging
a
crime?
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
dreeben,
isn't
the
point
that
the
tremendous
cost
that
you
refer
to
is
a
tremendous
cost
that
the
government
pays
by
its
choice
to
go
to
trial,
as
opposed
to
going
back
to
the
grand
jury
and
making
sure
that
it
has
an
adequate
indictment?
