chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
united
states
versus
resendiz-ponce.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
necessarily
make
sense.
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
the
probable
cause
and
the
eventual
evidence
that
supports
guilt
is
adduced
after
the
indictment
and
the
prosecutor
says,
you
know,
we're
going
to
find
that
evidence
once
we
get
into
it,
we
don't
have
it
now,
but
indict
anyway
without
it.
in
other
words,
what's
your
response
to
the
situation
where
there's
no
probable
cause
on
an
element
at
the
time
of
the
indictment,
but
that
evidence
is
later
adduced
and
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
convict?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
sits
to
decide
whether
people
should
be
indicted,
and
yes,
they're
supposed
to
determine
whether
there's
probable
cause,
but
historically
a
significant
role
for
the
grand
jury
has
been
not
to
indict
people
even
though
the
government
had
the
evidence
to
indict
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
baggot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
any...
you're
not
suggesting
to
us
that
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
for
intentionally
attempting
to
enter
the
united
states
at
or
near
san
luis
would
not
have
indicted
him
if
the
indictment
had
gone
further
and
said,
and
he
submitted
false
ids?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
an
element.
you
talk
about
essential
facts
and
material...
i
mean,
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
intentionally
attempt
to
enter
the
united
states
having
previously
been
deported
and
all
that.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
presenting
false
identification.
so
why
are
those
essential
facts
when
they're
not
part
of
what
the
statute
prohibits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
baggot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
05-998,
united
states
versus
resendiz-ponce,
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion.
