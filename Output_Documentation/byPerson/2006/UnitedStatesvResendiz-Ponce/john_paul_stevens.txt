justice
john
paul
stevens
we've
done
it
before,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
but
the
better
practice
usually
is
to
have
a
case
in
which
the
issue
really
presents
the
hard
question.
and
you're
asking
us
to
make
a
ruling
in
this
case
that
would
govern
failure
to
allege
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
a
death
case,
for
example,
which
has
a
different
atmosphere
to
the
whole
case
when
you're
facing
that
kind
of
an
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
judge's
reaction
to
a
case
is
often
affected
by
just
exactly
what's
involved.
and
here
it's
just
hard
to
see
how
anyone
could
claim
any
particular
prejudice
out
of
the
error
in
this
particular
case
or,
really,
it's
arguable
that
there's
no
defect
in
the
indictment
at
all
because
it
was
adequate
notice
to
the
defendant
of
what
he's
charged
with.
this
is
much
like
a
case
in
the
state
systems
where
you
have
notice
pleading.
it
doesn't
seem
very
prejudicial.
but
you
put
it
in
a
different
context,
you
might
have
a
different
reaction
to
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
should
the
test
for
the
missing
element
be
different
for
the
test
for
the
wrong
element?
in
other
words,
suppose
the
indictment
alleged
he
walked
up
to
the
border
and
the
evidence
showed
he
rode
a
bicycle.
there's
a
variance.
would
that
present
a
different
legal
issue
than
if
they
just
leave
the
overt
act
entirely
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
the
test
for
judging
the
two
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
between
a
variance
and
an
omission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
clearly
different.
he
rode
a
bicycle
instead
of
walking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
here
you've
got
notice
he
made
an
attempt,
but
you
didn't
tell
us
whether
he
rode
the
bicycle
or
he
walked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
problem
i'm
trying
to
think
through
is
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
between
those
two
situations.
it
seems
to
me
they're
equally
likely
to
produce
prejudice
or
lack
of
notice
and
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
letter
of
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
a
grand
jury
indicted
respondent
on
one
account
of
illegally
attempting
to
reenter
the
united
states
after
deportation.
the
indictment
charge
that
on
or
about
june
1,
2003,
respondent
knowingly
and
intentionally
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
of
america
at
or
near
saint
louis
in
the
district
of
arizona
after
having
been
previously
denied
admission
excluded,
deported
and
removed
from
the
united
states.
after
the
district
court
denied
respondent’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
failure
to
allege
an
overt
act
a
jury
found
him
guilty.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
concluding
that
in
indictment’s
omission
of
an
essential
element
of
an
offense
is
not
subject
to
harmless-error
analysis.
because
the
indictment
did
not
explicitly
allege
an
overt
act
the
ninth
circuit
found
it
to
be
fatally
deficient.
we
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
omission
of
an
element
of
a
criminal
offence
from
a
federal
indictment
can
constitute
harmless-error.
after
oral
argument,
however,
we
ordered
the
parties
to
file
a
supplemental
briefs
directed
to
the
question
whether
the
indictment
against
respondent
did
in
fact
omit
an
allegation
that
is
required
by
the
fifth
amendment.
we
conclude
that
it
did
not
and
therefore
reverse
without
reaching
the
harmless-error
issue.
as
it
was
true
at
common
law
that
crime
of
attempt
contains
both
an
intent
and
an
overt
act
requirement.
the
underlined
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
indictment
charging
attempted
illegal
entry
must
specifically
allege
a
particular
overt
act.
the
government
argues
that
the
indictment
implicitly
includes
a
necessary
overt
act
simply
by
alleging
that
a
defendant
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
and
we
agrees
not
only
does
the
word
“attempt”
as
used
in
common
parlance
connote
action
rather
than
mere
intent,
but,
more
importantly
the
law
has
recognized
for
centuries
that
attempt
necessarily
encompasses
both
an
overt
act
and
intent
component.
the
use
of
the
word
“attempt”
coupled
with
specification
of
the
time
and
place
the
respondents
attempted
illegal
reentry
therefore,
satisfy
the
two
requirements
for
indictments
that
we
have
announced
in
our
cases.
it
fairly
informed
the
respondent
of
the
charges
against
him
and
it
provided
him
with
protection
against
future
prosecution
for
the
same
offense.
justice
scalia
accordingly
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
remand
the
case
for
further
proceeding.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting.
