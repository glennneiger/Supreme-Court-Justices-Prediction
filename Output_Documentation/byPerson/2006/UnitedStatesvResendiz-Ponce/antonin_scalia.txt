justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
mean
you
can
never
decide
this
question
until
after
the
trial
is
completed
and
you
see
whether
the
jury
convicts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
why
would
there
be
any
difference
then?
that's
a
question
i
was
about
to
put
to
you.
what
if
there
is
no
indictment
at
all?
why
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing?
well,
you
know,
the
only
purpose
of
getting
it
is
to
see
if
there
was
probable
cause
and
you
now
have
a
conviction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
pushing
it,
i
think
it's
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
if
we
disagree
with
you
here,
could
this
defendant
be
retried?
could
he
be
reindicted?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
like
to
even
sharpen
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
let's
assume
that
the
indictment
did
set
forth
what
the
overt
act
was.
it
did.
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
overt
act
introduced
before
the
grand
jury.
what
would
the
result
of
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
trial
occurs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he's
convicted.
and
i
think
you're
going...
your
position
is
that
conviction
would
stand.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
you're
saying
it's
a
separate
offense,
but
a
lesser
included
offense
is
a
separate
offense.
it
just
happens
to
be
embraced
within
some
other
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean,
if
you're
tried
for
illegal
entry
and
the
government
doesn't
prove
the
illegal
entry
because
you're
under
supervision
when
you
get
in,
the
jury
could
not
convict
of
attempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
okay,
just
charge
with
attempt
without
setting
forth
the
overt
acts
for
the
attempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
baggot,
could
i
come
back
to
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question.
you
said
you
could
only
be
convicted
of
the
lesser
included
offense
if
the
lesser
included
offense
is
set
forth
explicitly
in
the
indictment.
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
that's
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
said
in
my
previous
question,
every
lesser
included
offense
is
itself
a
substantive
offense.
that
doesn't
distinguish
attempt
from
anything
else.
and
my
understanding
is
if
you're
charged
with
a
greater
offense,
the
lesser
can
be
a
subject
of
conviction
even
though
it's
not
explicitly
set
forth
in
the
indictment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
that
is
the
case
here,
then
it
seems
to
me
he
could
have
been
convicted
of
attempt
without
ever
having
had
set
forth
in
the
indictment
the
overt
act
that
you
demand.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
is
attempt
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
substantive
offense
of
illegal
reentry?
