mr.
scott
a.
shorr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
intended
to
require
a
knowing
violation
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
it
expressly
said
so.
it
did
not
do
so
in
connection
with
the
claims
here
under
section
1681n(a)(1)(a).
in
each
instance
where
congress
wanted
to
allow...
to
require
a
higher
mens
rea,
it
said
so
and
did
so
in
connection
with
liability
that
was
greater.
they
required
knowing
mens
rea
for
the
criminal
provision.
they
required
knowing
mens
rea
to
obtain
the
even
higher
statutory
damages
that
are
available
under
the
act.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
justice
souther,
i
think
the
only
thing
we
can
say
about
that
is
congress
reduced
the
culpability
for
the
actual
damages
from
gross
negligence
to
negligence.
i
don't
think
that
tells
us
much
about
willful
means,
what
willful
means
as
a
separate
matter.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
no,
justice
souter,
i
suggest
that
what
you
can
infer
from
that
is
that,
if
anything,
is
perhaps
congress
wanted
to
move,
make
clear
that
under
o
the
actual
damages
aren't
close
to
willful
or
reckless,
so
they
reduced
gross
negligence
to
negligence
in
that
circumstance.
but
that
still
doesn't
tell
us
separately
what
"willful"
meant,
and
of
course
"willful"
had
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
similar
cases
involving
similar
statutes
to
mean
a
knowing
or
reckless
disregard.
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--i
think
if
anything,
justice
souter,
here
the
context
should
be
the
actual
statutory
terms
used,
and
in
section
1681n(b)
they
expressly
required
the
knowing
standard
and
that's
a
knowing
violation
of
the
law,
as
justice
alito's
question
seemed
to
draw
out,
a
knowing
impermissible
purpose.
and
the
statute
directly
defines
what
a
permissible
purpose
is
under
this
law.
so
that
reference
to
knowing
could
not
refer
to
a
knowing,
knowing
the
facts.
and
of
course,
willful
in
some
sense
always
includes
some
knowledge
of
the
factual
circumstances.
in
addition,
the
logical
structure
of
the
act...
as
i
mentioned,
we
had
negligence
and
actual
damages.
we
have
a
reckless
standard,
a
knowing
or
reckless
standard
for
certain
statutory
damages,
but
then
an
even
higher
level
for
the
criminal
and
higher
statutory
penalty
provisions.
and
as
i
started
to
say,
a
willful,
knowing,
reckless
standard
is
entirely
consistent
with
how
this
court
has
interpreted
the
term
in
similar
civil
statutes
that
were
in
fact
passed
about
the
same
time
the
hazen
paper
case
and
thurston
and
mclaughlin
cases
interpreting
the
ada
and
the
flsa
and
other
similar
cases.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
mr.
chief
justice,
of
course
we
believe
and
the
statute
is
in
fact
clear,
you
do
not
need
further
interpretation
by
the
court.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
if
you
don't
agree
with
us--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--i
think
that
there
is
a
level
of
objective
component
that
the
statute
at
least
has
to
be
understood
by
a
reasonable
person
at
some
level
using
standard
statutory
construction.
but
that
isn't
to
suggest
that
the
statute
needs
to
be
interpreted
by
a
higher
court
or
even
a
district
court
for
counsel
to
get
guidance.
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
guidance
supporting
respondents...
excuse
me...
no
guidance
supporting
petitioners',
defendants',
position.
in
fact,
the
only
guidance
supported
our
position,
including
guidance
from
the
ftc.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
i
am
talking
about
the
ball
letter.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
it
was
not,
and
we
are
not
suggesting
it
is,
although
it's
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
but
if
you
get
past
the
minimal
level
of
objective
standard,
the
question
becomes
what
indicia
and
markers
were
out
there
that
would
have
guided
this
company
as
to
whether
there
was
a
high
risk
that
they
were
violating
the
act.
and
certainly
the
ball
letter,
which
was
sent
by
the
staff
specifically
to
address
this
exact
question
and
to
guide
insurance
companies,
gave
notice
and
it
said
charging
anyone
a
higher
amount
than
the
best
available
rate
based
on
their
credit
score
was
an
adverse
action.
and
in
addition,
there
was--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--yes.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
yes,
and
this
is
the
adverse
action
question.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
and
i'm
happy
to
do
so
now.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
divided
in
the
sense...
well,
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
overturned
the
district
court's
ruling
so
there's
no
current
division,
but
if
that's
what
you
mean,
yes,
your
honor.
in
a...
i
guess
i'll
address
quickly
your
question.
there's
additional
guidance
provided
by
the
ftc
that
was
subject
to
formal
rulemaking
and
that
was
16
cfr,
i
believe
it's
part
601
appendix
c,
and
in
that
instance
the
ftc,
again
subject
to
formal
notice
and
comment
of
rulemaking,
said
that
the
statute
is
defined
very
broadly
and
it
includes
any
action
that
can
even
be
considered
to
have
a
negative
impact.
and
that
plays
in
the
subjective
aspect
as
well,
but
addressing
your
question,
justice
breyer,
first
on
the
statutory
language--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--that
was--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--that
was
guidance,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
that
was
guidance.
that
was
guidance
to
provide
in
the
context
of
reading
this
statute,
it
should
be
read
broadly.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
in
addition,
the
ceo
would
have
the
guidance
provided
by
the
ball
letter.
but
again
addressing
your
question,
justice
breyer,
an
increase
based
on
credit,
if
we
had
let's
say
an
increase
based
on
race,
someone
goes
in
and
has
a
product
to
buy
and
there's
the
best
rate,
and
they
charge
someone
else
based
on
their
race
a
higher
rate,
certainly
that's
an
increase
based
on
credit.
there's
only
one
best
rate.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
and
your
honor,
i
was
only
using
that
example
to
try
and
explain
the
statutory
language.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
well,
here
we
have--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--you're
charging
someone
more
based
on
credit.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
i
think--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--applying
it
to
credit,
a
natural
definition
that
is
charging
someone
more
than
you
charge
others
is
an
increase.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
because
charging
someone
more
than
someone
else
who
qualifies
for
that
better
rate
based
on
their
credit,
is
increasing
them,
charging
them
more,
but
it's
also
evident
from
the
statutory
purpose,
which
i
think
was
a
question
you
asked--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--we
believe
that
it's
a
standard
dictionary
definition,
to
charge
someone
more
for
insurance
than
they
would
otherwise
qualify
for
is
increasing
their
charge.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
i
think
we
can
look
at
any
dictionary.
i
don't
have
a
cite,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
i
think
it
has
to
be
an
increase
based
on
some
aspect,
but
the
only
way
to
give
effect
to
that
statutory
purpose
is
an
increase
above
what
you
would
otherwise
qualify
for
had
you
had
better
credit
and
of
course--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--i
don't
think
the
notice
is
problematic
because
you're
alerting
the
consumer
to
check
that
the
information
that
the
insurance
company
expressly
relied
on
to
increase
your
charge--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--i
don't
think
you
need
a
prior
charge
to
suffer
an
increase.
if
i
walk
into
a
candy
store
and
i've
never
purchased
that
candy
before
but
the
best
price
that
day
is
5
cents
but
they
say
we're
going
to
charge
you
10
cents,
i've
certainly
suffered
an
increase.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
sure.
the...
as
an
initial
matter,
it's
not
the
perfect
credit
that
is
the
standard,
it's
whatever
would
qualify
you
for
geico's
best
rate.
and
that's
a
much
broader
standard.
we
don't
know
the
exact
amounts
but
if
you
look
at
geico
ja
6768,
they
have
fairly
broad
tiers,
maybe
five
or
six.
and
of
course
not
everyone
is
going
to
get
the
notice.
if
your
driving
record
totally
eliminates...
if
you
have
great
credit
but
your
driving
record
eliminates
the
possibility
that
you
qualify
for
the
better
rate,
you
wouldn't
get
notice
in
that
circumstance
either.
but
the
key
to
the
notice
is,
if
i
have
very
good
credit
but
the
information
that
the
insurance
company
looks
at
is
incorrect,
i
will
be
charged
more
based
on
incorrect
information
without
ever
having
the
opportunity
to
tell
the
insurance
company
or
whoever
is
collecting
that
information
for
them,
you've
charged
me
the
wrong
amount
and
i
in
fact
qualify
for
that
better
rate.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
well,
what's
significant
here,
that
has
been
added
to
the
statute
in
the
last
two
years.
but
since
1970,
congress's
concern
is
giving
notice
at
a
critical
time,
when
the
insurance
company
tells
you
we
are
relying
on
it
and
we
may
have
taken
an
adverse
action.
i
wanted
to
also
mention,
here
it's
not
just
an
increase.
there's
also
been
a
denial,
and
that
mr.
edo
applied
for
insurance
from
geico,
and
was
denied
insurance
with
the
stand-alone
company
geico
general,
so
that
is
also
an
adverse
action
under
the
act.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
because
that...
geico's
argument,
and
i
think
that's
what
they
want,
presumes
they're
looking
at
accurate
credit
information.
and
the
problem
is,
congress
has
always
told
that
there
is
significant
inadequacy
in
the
credit
information.
i
think
it's
cited
in
the
national
consumer
law
center
brief.
in
1996,
congress
was
told
that
the
error
rate
in
consumer
information
was
50
percent
and
there
was
a
20
percent
serious
error
in
the
rates.
under
geico's
interpretation--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--because
under
geico's
theory
of
the
statute
you
may
never
get
notice,
even
though
you're
being
charged
more
for
insurance
based
on
inaccurate
information,
as
long
as
you're
not
charge...
your
charge
doesn't
move
below
average.
so
a
lot
of
people
who
are
in
fact
intended
to
be
protected
under
this
act
will
not
be
protected
until
their
charge
goes
below
average,
even
though
the
insurance
company
is
continuing
to
charge
them
more
based
on
inaccurate
information.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
because
going
through
the
statute
and
the
increase
based
on
credit,
and
then
the
notice
will
give
them
the
opportunity
to
check.
since
the
consumer
here
is
the...
it's
a
system
of
checks
and
balances,
and
unless
you
give
this
consumer
the
opportunity
to
check
that
they
are
in
fact
using
the
correct
information,
it
wasn't
mistaken,
it
wasn't
driven
down
by
identity
theft,
you
can
continue
to
charge
people
more--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--based
on
inaccurate
information.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
both
based
on
the
premise
and
purpose
of
statute,
yes.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
briefly
addressing
the
application
of
the
standard
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
we
do
think
it's
appropriate
to
remand
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
some
new
developments.
geico
has
just
recently
produced
documents
to
us
that
addressly...
directly
address
the
question
of
scienter
here,
so
if
there's...
if
you
go
past
a
minimum
threshold--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--because
those
documents
directly
address
the
subject
of
standard
here,
that
geico
was
reckless
or
understood
their--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
i
want
to
be
careful,
because
i
had
presented...
i
asked
to
lodge
them
with
the
court
and
i
can
quote
them
if
necessary,
but
within
those
documents
there
is
direct
evidence
that
geico
interpreted
the
statute
exactly
how
we
do,
that
not
putting
someone
in
the
best
tier
based
on
credit--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--no,
your
honor.
in
this
instance,
this
document
involves
top
level
geico
executives.
and
with
respect
to
the
advice
of
counsel
issue,
frankly
it's
a
red
herring.
we
have
never
asked
to
compel
the
defendants
in
either
of
these
cases
or
any
of
the
cases
we're
involved
in,
to
waive
their
privilege.
they've
got
the
right,
of
course,
to
offer
advice
of
counsel
as
an
affirmative...
as
a
defense
in
this
case,
but
we
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
prove
our
case
to
even
reach
what
the
counsel
said.
we
believe
we
can
prove
our
case
based
on
the
documents
and
subjective
intent
alone.
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
if
the
statute
was
clear
and
the
guidance--
mr.
scott
a.
shorr
--and
with
respect
to
the
district
court,
we
believe
the
district
court
here
clearly
erred,
as
the
ninth
circuit
found.
and
the
guidance...
that
opinion
certainly
didn't
precede
the
conduct
that's
at
issue
here.
the
only
guidance,
again,
available
at
the
time
supported
our
reading
of
the
statute.
there
was
no
guidance
from
and
court
or
from
the
ftc,
or
from
anywhere
that
would
have
supported
defendants'
interpretation
at
that
time.
so
that's
another
aspect
of
inquiry,
the
subjective
intent
of
the
defendants.
if
there
are
no
other
questions?
