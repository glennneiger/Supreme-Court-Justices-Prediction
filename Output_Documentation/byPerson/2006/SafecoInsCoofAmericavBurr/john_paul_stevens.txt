it
is
a
subjective
standard
or
an
objective
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
the
potential
liability,
as
in
these
cases,
is
huge,
then
you
have
to
be
even
more
careful
because
there
is
liability
so
great.
so
is
it
the
greater
the
liability...
the
greater
chance
of
recklessness,
the
greater
the
potential
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner
on
the
meaning
of
adverse
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
read
your
reference
to
those
documents.
explain
why
you
think
that's
so
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
those
documents
shed
any
light
on
recklessness?
i
didn't
see
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
the
documents
that
you
describe
shed
any
light
on
the
extent
of
their
recklessness,
if
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
really
understand
this
part
of
the
case
very
much.
assume
that
a
lawyer
writes
a
letter
saying
you
read
it
two
or
three
different
ways,
read
the
statute,
it's
very
ambiguous,
and
we
think
the
government's
reading
is
the
better
reading.
and
the
executives
think
about
it
and
they
say
no,
we
don't
think
that's
right.
has
that
proved
reckless
disregard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
statute's
clear.
and
of
course,
miss
mahoney
said
the
district
judge
thought
it
was
clear,
but
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
reading
of
the
statute
in
subsection
i
about,
in
the
charges
for
insurance
advice,
seems
to
favor
your
view.
but
subsection
ii
about
denial
of
employment
really
seems
to
read
in
favor
of
the
government's
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
my
point
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
getting
a
lesser
salary,
it
just
seems
like
the
first
applicant
would
be
an
adverse
employment
action
under
subparagraph
ii,
just...
do
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
adversely
affects
any
current
or
prospective
employee.
now
the
language
in
i
isn't,
it
doesn't
read
that
way.
but
the
thing
that's
troubling
me
is
whether
you
should
interpret
i
in
the
light
of
what
ii
seems
to
say.
