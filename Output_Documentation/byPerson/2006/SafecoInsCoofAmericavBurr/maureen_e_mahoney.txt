ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
term
"willfully"
and
its
determination
that
the
case
had
to
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings
to
permit
an
opportunity
to
explore
petitioners'
communications
with
their
counsel.
we
ask
this
court
to
find
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
any
such
inquiry
for
waivers
of
attorney-client
privilege
because
summary
judgment
should
have
been
affirmed
in
this
case.
petitioners
and
their
counsel,
if
you
think
about
what
communications
you
might
find,
they
could
not
have
known
anything
more
about
these
statutory
issues
of
first
impression
than
the
district
court
did.
it's
questions
of
law.
and
if
the
district
court's
opinion
does
not
reflect
reckless
disregard
for
the
law,
for
the
reading
of
the
statute,
then
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
characterize
petitioners'
adoption
of
the
very
same
views
as
either
a
knowing
or
reckless
violation
of
the,
of
the
fcra.
the
first...
the
ninth
circuit
nevertheless
reached
a
contrary
conclusion,
and
said
it
was
time
to
go
ahead
and
look
at
privileged
communications
if
the
petitioners
wanted
to
defend
the
case,
because
they
made
self-interpretive
errors
about
the
meaning
of
willfully.
and
the
first
is
that
they
read
willfully
in
this
setting
to
mean
recklessly,
and
relied
on
several
cases
where
this
court
has
read
the
term
willfully
in
civil
statutes
to
mean
recklessly.
but
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
word
willfully
is
contextual,
that
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
sections
of
the
statute
to
see
how
it's
used
to
determine
whether
it
means
with
knowledge
that
your
conduct
violates
the
law,
or
whether
reckless
violations
are
sufficient.
and
in
this
particular
statute,
unlike
the
other
three
that
were
at
issue,
congress
has
used
the
term
willfully
in
other
sections
of
the
law
to
mean,
as
plaintiffs
concede,
that
the
defendant
knows
that
their
conduct
violates
the
act.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
it
actually
says
"willfully
and
knowingly
#"--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
this
court,
though,
has
held
that
willfully
and
knowingly,
when
that
phrase
is
used
together,
it's
been
discussed
in
a
number
of
cases
including
dixon
recently,
that
it
means...
willfully
means
knowledge
that
the
conduct
violates
the
law,
and
knowingly
means
knowledge
of
the
relevant
facts.
and
that
would
make
perfect
sense
in
this
setting,
and
so
the
term
willfully
when,
again,
used--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
in
ratzlaf,
the
phrase
was
willfully,
not
willfully
and
knowingly,
and
the
court
held
that
it
meant
that
you
knew
that
your
conduct
violated
the
law.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
most
reasonable
reading
here
because
if
you
look,
there
are
also
sections
of
section
1681n
that
refer
to
knowing
conduct,
and
that
would
require
the
conclusion
that
congress
used
willfully
in
this
section
to
mean
a...
a
less...
a
more...
a
less
culpable
mens
rea
than
knowingly.
and
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
under...
some
cases
have
suggested
that
there
could
be
a
willful
blindness
instruction
that
would
govern
whether
you
define
that
as
knowing
or
not.
certainly--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
the
best
reading
of
knowingly
is
actual
knowledge
or
something
that
is,
that
is
everything
but,
you
know,
that
really
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
conscious
disregard
is
a
recklessness
standard,
and
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
determined
that
this
should
be
interpreted
as
a
recklessness
standard,
this
court
has
defined
recklessness
to
mean
that
it
has
to
be
conscious
disregard,
actual
knowledge
of
a
high
risk
of,
of...
of
harm
or
in
this
case
illegality.
and
in
these
circumstances,
you
can't
say
that
there
was
a
high
risk
of
illegality
because
what
the
district
court
found
is
that
the
petitioners'
interpretations
of
the
statute
were
actually
not
only
reasonable,
but
correct,
and
having--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
the
way
it's
used,
it
says
knowing,
knowingly
that
they
did
not
have
a
permissible
purpose.
permissible
purpose,
that
may
not
be
knowledge
of
the
law,
it
just
may
be
knowledge
that
your
purpose
wasn't
permissible.
and
even
if
they
were
using
it--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
does,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
individual
knew
precisely
what
the
statute
said.
because
for
instance,
users
are
told
what
the
permissible
purposes
are
when
they
get
a
credit
report
from,
from
a
credit
agency.
but
more
importantly,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
use
of
the
term
knowingly
there
can
also
be
explained.
if
you
look
at
section
1681h,
it
actually
provides
that
certain
tort
actions
cannot
proceed
unless
there
is
a
willful
intent
to
injure,
except
as
provided
in
section
1681n,
and
they
are
the
same
kinds
of
actions
that
are
carved
out
in
1681n.
and
so
i
think
it
was
to
make
clear,
i
think
it
was
to
make
clear
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
a
willful
intent
to
injure.
so
even
if
they
meant
it
to
be
interchangeable
with
a
knowing
violation
of
the
law
there,
i
think
there
was
a
reason
for
it,
it
wasn't
just
surplusage.
it
was
to
clarify
that
they
didn't
have
to
have
a
willful
intent
to
violate.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
i
think
you
can
look
to
the
way
this
court
described
recklessness
in
farmer
vs.
brennan
as
well,
though,
as
well
as--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
difference
is
just,
there
is
two
forms
of
recklessness.
one
which
says
that
if
the
risk
is
sufficiently
high,
if
a
person
should
have
known,
you
could
be...
you
could
be
liable.
but
that
the
form
of
recklessness
that
congress
presumably
used
here
in
this
setting,
where
there
is
the
potential
for
very
punitive
sanctions,
was
what
is
referred
to...
farmer
versus
brennan
calls
it
"criminal",
the
criminal
recklessness
standard.
and
that
means
that
not
only
do
you
have
to
have
an
objectively
high
risk
of
illegality,
but
you
must
be
actually
conscious
of
that
risk.
but
in
this
case,
you
don't
even
need
to
get
to
the
issue
of
consciousness.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
question
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
the
issue
of
conscious...
the
risk,
though,
it
has
to
be
a
high
risk.
and
if
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute,
or
even
if
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
is
fairly
debatable,
that
you
have
a
fair
chance
of
success,
then
how
can
you
say
that
is
a
high
risk
of
illegality,
so
high
that
we
should
say
that
congress
wanted
to
sanction
you
for
taking
that
position?
and
for
saying
that,
you
know,
you
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
adopt
a
compliance
program
if
there
was
a
fair
ground
for
believing
that
it
was
lawful.
and
here
what
the
ninth
circuit
did--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
if,
in
fact,
it
was
a
fair
ground
for--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't...
yes.
but
you
couldn't
know
you
were
violating
it,
and
because
if
it
really
is
a
fair
ground
for
litigation--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
if
it's
an
area
where
the
law
is
truly
unsettled.
and
here
an
issue
of
first
impression,
a
lawyer's
assessment
that
you
may
lose
is
inherently
predictive.
these
are
not
true
or
false
answers
when
there
is
almost
nothing
to
go
on.
and
so
in
that
area,
it's
much
like
what
this
court
did
in
screws,
where
it
said
that
this
was
a
case
involving
a
willful
violation
of,
or
interference
with
rights
secured
by...
by
federal
law.
and
what
the
court
says,
well,
it's
not
just
any
bad
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind,
it
is
a
bad
purpose
to
defy
announced
rules
of
law.
they
have
to
be,
there
has
to
be
sufficient
clarity
in
the
law
to
say
that
there
was
a
high
risk
of
illegality
that
you
could
disregard.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
only--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
you
would
look
at
the
intent
until
you
found
that
there...
there
was
no
reasonable
ground
or
at
least
no,
no...
no
fair
ground
for
debate
about
the
question.
and
at
that
point,
your
honor,
if
there
was
an
objectively
high
risk
of
illegality,
then
you
do
have
to
ask,
what
were
they
consciously
aware
of;
what
did
they
do?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
think
in
screws--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
so.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
screws
says
you
can't
know
the
unknowable.
and
if
the
law,
if
it's
really,
truly
an
issue
of
first
impression,
you
may
think
you're
violating
the
law,
but
you...
you
can't
know
the
unknowable.
and
that's
why
this
setting
is
so
important,
because
you
can't,
you
know,
put...
impose
sanctions.
here
we're
talking
about
the
potential
for
an
industry
facing
billions
of
dollars
without
any
actual
harm
to...
to
individuals.
and
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
believe
that
there
are
two
certified
class
actions.
but
many...
there
are
many
cases
pending
and
it
could
be
billions
of
dollars,
your
honor.
certainly
if
the
classes
are
certified,
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i'm
sure
there
would
be
some
bases
to
resist.
but
classes
have
been
certified,
so
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
do
not
believe
any
have
gone
to
judgment,
but
i
don't,
i
don't...
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
if
you
allow
a
thousand
dollar
penalty
or
the
potential
for
a
thousand
dollar
penalty
for
every
consumer
who
didn't
get
a
notice,
simply
because
they
may
have
gotten
a
better
price
if
they
had
even
better
credit,
across
the
country,
if
you
interpret
the
statute
that
way,
and
then
you
can
say
you
can
get
this
thousand
dollar,
what
is
in
essence
a
penalty,
and
you
multiply
that
by
the
number
of
consumers,
then
you
certainly
have
the
potential
for
very,
very
substantial
liability.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
given
that
these
are
proceeding
as
class
actions,
the
answer
is
there
is
plenty
on
the
line
to
incentivize
plaintiffs'
attorneys
to
bring
these
class
actions,
and
they
have
been
brought,
and
this
is
a
class
action.
there
are
two
class
actions.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
it
has
not.
they
are
putative
class
actions,
your
honor.
but
i,
but
i
think
that
whether
it's
a
class
action
or
not,
we
have
to
look
at
what
did,
what
did
congress
presumably
have
in
mind
when
it
authorized
these
kinds
of
penalties
and
punitive
damages
based
on
a
willful
violation
in
a
technical
area
where
there
is
no
potential
for
harm?
and
certainly--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--except
screws,
your
honor,
actually
says
that
it
was
adopting
a
criminal
recklessness
standard,
not
a
knowing
standard,
but
a
reckless
standard.
and
that
is
the
same
standard
that
has
been
applied
in
the
civil
cases
that
use
willfully
in
the
punitive
damages
context.
so
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
standard
in
that
screws
does
say
that
the,
you
can't
have,
it
can't
just
be
a
bad
purpose,
that
it
has
to
have
been
a
bad
purpose
to
violate
clearly
defined
rules.
and
this
court
has
said
in
various
contexts
in
the,
in
the
qualified
immunity
area
that
picking
the
losing
side
does
not
mean
that
your
conduct
was
objectively,
you
know,
wrongful.
and
that's
really...
i
think
that
there
is
great
significance
to
the
district
court's
ruling.
i'm
not
saying
that
in
every
case,
it
would
absolutely
be
dispositive.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
the,
you
know,
the
clarity
of
the
law,
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court.
but
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
is
that
it,
in
essence,
said
that
you
can't
rely
on
creative
but
unlikely
answers
to
issues
of
first
impression.
well,
if
an
administration
official
goes
to
a
lawyer
in
the
administration
and
asks
about
a
course
of
conduct,
and
is
told,
well,
it's
completely
an
issue
of
first
impression,
there
is
probably
a
40
percent
chance
of
success,
do
you
say
it's
reckless
to
proceed
on
that
basis?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
certainly...
this
court
has
made
clear
that
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
very
plain,
then,
of
course,
that
can
be
noticed,
that
can
be
adequate
warning.
but
certainly
this
statute
doesn't
satisfy
that
standard.
congress
didn't
provide
the
benchmarks
that
you
have
to
use
for
comparison
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
an
increase
in
a
charge
or
whether
there
has
been
an
adverse
action
based
on
the
consumer
report.
you
need
benchmarks
to
answer
those
questions,
and
there
aren't
any
regulations
and
there
were
no
cases.
if
i
could
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if
i
could
start
by
just
responding
to
the
issue
of
the
new
document,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
this
document
was
created
by
people
who
weren't
lawyers.
it
was
done
before
geico
even
started
using
credit
to
price
insurance.
they
were...
said
they
were
brainstorming
about
what
the
statute
might
mean.
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
supplemental
excerpt
of
records
at
504
where
when
geico
implemented
the
policy
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the...
they
said
that
the
intent
was
that
we
would
send
to
the
people
who
were
supposed
to
get
the
adverse
action
notice.
with
the
early
systems
development
we
didn't
have
the
ability
to
identify
whether
they
were
supposed
to
receive
the
notice
or
not;
that
was
because
they
had
not
yet
developed
the
way
to
do
with
what
they
call
the
neutral,
where
they
compare
how
the
applicant
would
have
done
if
they
hadn't
taken
credit,
hadn't
taken
credit
into
account
at
all.
and
this
is
a
procedure
that's
required
actually
in
most
states
in
order
to
ensure
that
those
who
don't
want
to
allow
access
to
credit
reports
or
who
don't
have
a
sufficient
credit
history
are
not
treated
adversely
in
the
meaning
of
those
state
laws,
and
that
means
worse
than
the
average
loss
ratio.
so
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
even
if
you
take
into
account
the
documents
they're
talking
about,
to
suggest
that
there
was
somehow
a
knowing
or
deliberate
intent
to
try
to
violate
the
law.
with
respect
to
a
few
of
the
factual
or...
issues
that
came
up,
safeco
estimates
that
approximately
80
percent
of
all
consumers
that
they
are
selling
new
insurance
to
now
have
to
get
notice
under
the
standards
established
by
the
ninth
circuit.
with
respect
to
who
can
qualify
for
the
top
tier
of
credit,
it's
only,
at
least
at
geico,
approximately
10
percent.
so
90
percent
of
the
consumers
would
not
qualify
for
that.
and
the
statute
very
plainly
does
not
prohibit
differential
treatment
based
on
persons
with
better
credit,
nor
do
state
laws.
and
so
the
analogy
as
to
race
discrimination
simply
don't
hold
water,
because
there
congress
has
told
you
what
the
baseline
is,
you
can't
treat
any
person
of
a
different
race
in
a
different
way,
and
that's
not
true
under
this
statute.
and
instead,
it's
quite
reasonable,
as
geico
has
concluded,
to
simply
say
look,
if
we
wouldn't...
if
we're
treating
you
worse
than
we
would
have
treated
you
if
we
ever
looked
at
your
credit
report,
worse
than
if
you
had
an
average
loss
ratio
for
this
criteria,
we'll
send
you
the
notice.

well,
generally
there
are
about
15
factors
that
they
look
at
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
prediction
of
loss
ratio,
and
someone
who
has
a
good
credit
history
is
generally
regarded
as
responsible,
and
responsible
people
tend
to
make
less
claims.
and
so,
again,
it's
just
one
factor
of
15
though.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well
actually,
i
think
that
when
you
factor
in
employment,
it
has...
it
has
the
opposite
effect.
because
what
happens
here
is
if
you're
using
employment
verification
reports,
consumer
reports
about
employment,
there
are
all
kinds
of
consumer
reports.
how
do
you
tell
who
had
the
optimal
employment
history?
how
could
the
baseline
be
the
best
employment
history
possible?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that
if
you...
that
in
other
words,
if
you
gave
someone
a
lower
salary--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
that
if
geico
in
this
example,
if
you
actually
pay
them
less
because
you
looked
at
their
credit
report,
then
geico
would
concede
that
that
is
in
fact
an
adverse
action.
so
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent
at
all.
thank
you,
your
honor.
