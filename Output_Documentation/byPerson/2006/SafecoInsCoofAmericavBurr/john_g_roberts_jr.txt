chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
06-84,
safeco
insurance
company
versus
burr,
and
06-100,
geico
general
insurance
company
versus
edo.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
you're
the
ceo
of
your
company,
and
a
lawyer...
federal
counsel
comes
in
and
says
we've
got
a
real
issue
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
i
need
to
brief
you
on
that,
we
need
to
make
an
important
decision
about
whether
we
are
complying,
you
say
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
it,
i
don't
want
to
know
about
it.
that
would
not
be
willfully
violating
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
actual
knowledge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
because
an
issue
is
one
of
first
impression
doesn't
mean
there's
a
high
degree
of
uncertainty.
the
statute
may
be
clearly
addressed
to
that
issue.
it
hasn't
come
up
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first
impression.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
you
think
if
i
have
an
insurance
policy,
i'm
paying
a
certain
rate,
they
look
at
my
credit
report
and
they
say,
you
know,
good
news,
we're
going
to
lower
your
rates,
that's
an
adverse
action
because
they
might
have
lowered
the
rates
even
further
if
they
had
notified
me
about
the
credit
report
and
there
were
some
errors
in
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
they
lower,
if
they
lower
the
rates,
you
still
say
that
that
fits
the
meaning
of
adverse
action
because
they
might
have
lowered
them
further
if
the
information
hadn't
been
erroneous?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shorr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
even
if
you're
right
about
the
standard,
how
can
you
suggest
that
it's
willful
here
when
you
have
no
judicial
construction,
you
have
no
administrative
construction,
you
have
the
statutory
language
that
at
least
the
questions
this
morning
have
suggested
is
not
perfectly
clear?
how
can
you
suggest
that
the
action
of
the
companies
on
this
case
even
under
your
standard
was
willful?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
that,
you
would
lose
on
the
application
of
the
willfulness
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
your,
your,
your
conclusion
that
this
was
a
willful
violation
depends
upon
your
assertion
that
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
the
ball
letter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
wasn't
even
binding
on
the
commission,
so
why
would
that
be
regarded
as
authoritative?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
is
not
an
antidiscrimination
provision.
it
doesn't
say
anyone
who
discriminates
in
the
setting
of
race
has
to
send
out
letters.
it
requires
an
adverse
action.
it
requires
an
increase
in
the
charge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
you
have
that
right
independently,
though,
every
year
to
look
at
a
copy
of
your
credit
report?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
you
look
at
the
increase
with
respect
to
the
best
credit
rate,
why
is
that?
why
wouldn't
you
look
at
it
relative
to
say
the
average
insured
who
walks
in
the
door?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
what
pertinence
that
has
to
my
question
which
is,
why
do
you
get
to
pick
the
best
credit
report
as
the
baseline
from
which
you
would
measure
your
hypothetical
increase?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who's
geico?
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
particular
lawyers
at
a
particular
level,
an
ongoing
debate
about
what
this
law
means.
if
you
get
one
lawyer
who
says,
you
know,
i
think
you
could
read
it
this
way,
does
that
mean
that
geico
reads
it
that
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
mahoney.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
06-84,
safeco
insurance
company
versus
burr,
and
the
consolidated
case
06-100,
geico
general
insurance
versus
edo.
