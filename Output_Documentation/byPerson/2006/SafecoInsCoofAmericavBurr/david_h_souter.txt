justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
from
drafting
history
that
looks
at
the
history
both
of
little
n
and
little
o
and
it
points
out
that
as
originally,
in
the
original
bill,
little
o
providing
for
the
actual
damages
required
a
finding
of
gross
negligence?
little
n
used
the
word
"willful"
just
as
it
does
now,
suggesting
that
willful
would
not
include
gross
negligence
or
something
close
to
gross
negligence
like
recklessness.
then
in,
then
in
o,
they
changed
the
standard
from
gross
negligence
to
mere
negligence,
but
they
made
no
change
in
n,
which
suggests
that
n
stayed
whatever
it
always
was,
and
if
the
argument
from
contrast
was
that
n
probably
meant
knowing
rather
than
reckless,
it
stayed
knowing
even
when
the
standard
was
changed
to
negligence
in
o.
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
fact
that
they
had
originally
drafted
n
as
it
is,
in
contrast
to
the
original
o,
does
tell
us,
doesn't
it,
something
about
what
they
had
in
mind
in
n.
and
they
must
have
had
something
in
mind,
probably
had
in
mind,
something
in
n
which
was
a
standard
higher
than
gross
negligence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
there's
no
question
it
has
been
and
that
is
sort
of
the
usual
reading
in
the
civil
context.
but
we
also
keep
repeating,
you
know,
"willful"
is
a
word
of
many
meanings
and
you
always
look
to
the
context.
and
here
the
argument
is
that
if
you
look
to
the
context
of
the,
of
the
two
statutory
sections
right
up
next
to
each
other,
you
can
draw
a,
an
inference
about
what
"willful"
means.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
making
this
argument,
and
i
think
you
got
close
to
it
a
minute
ago
when
you
alluded
to
statutory
purpose.
i
think
this
is
what's
behind,
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
one
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
alert
a
consumer
that
the
consumer's
credit
report
may
contain
errors
which
are
doing
the
consumer
some
kind
of
damage.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
want
this
consumer
alerted
so
the
consumer
can
ask
to
see
the
report
and
correct
it
if
possible.
justice
david
h.
souter
reading
the
adverse
action
the
way
you
read
it,
it
would
give
the
consumer
or
consumers
a
tip-off
in
the
maximum
number
of
cases.
in
every
case
in
which
the
consumer
might
have
done
better
if
the
credit
report
had
assumed
different
facts,
on
your
reading
theoretically,
the
consumer
is
going
to
say
i
want
to
look
at
that
report
and
correct
it
if
it's
wrong.
but
isn't
the
fallacy
of
that
argument
the
fallacy
of
saying
because
that
is
one
object
of
the
statute,
every
term
within
the
statute
has
got
to
be
read
in
a
way
that
maximizes
the
effectuation
of
that
object?
and
the
trouble
that
we're
having
on
the
bench
is
that
discrimination
and
increase
are
different
terms.
increase
says
the
rate
actually
goes
up
from
a
baseline
that
the
consumer
previously
had,
whereas
discrimination
does
not.
and
your
reading
in
effect,
increase
to
mean
discrimination
in
order
to
maximize
the
likelihood
that
the
consumer
will
look
at
the
report,
isn't
that
the
basis
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
a
way
to
give
every
conceivable
effect
to
that
policy.
but
the
statute
in
drafting
adverse,
or
drafting
the
terms
of
adverse
action,
may
very
well
have
said
we
don't
want
to
give
every
conceivable
effect
to
this
purpose
because
if
we
do,
we'll
get
into
the
situation
that
justice
breyer
described.
everybody
will
be
getting
notices
and
the
notices
will
be
meaningless.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
set
the
charge.
i
mean,
that's
circular.
to
set
the
charge
that
it
gives
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we...
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
intended
to
be
protected
in
this
way
by
getting
this
notice?
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
basic
argument
is
the
statute,
the
definitions
of
adverse
action
have
got
to
be
read
in
a
way
that
maximizes
the
occasion
upon
which
a
consumer
will
get
a
notice
that
may
lead
that
consumer
to
ask
to
see
his
credit
report.
that's
your
basic
premise?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
these
cases
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
required
notice
to
any
consumer
who
suffers
from
what
the
act
calls
“adverse
action”
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
any
information
in
the
consumer
report
which
includes,
credit
reports
and
credit
scores.
this
notice
tells
the
consumer
about
the
adverse
action
and
gives
details
about
how
to
dispute
the
accuracy
of
the
report
used.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
act
defines
an
“adverse
action”
as
“an
increase
in
any
charge
for
any
insurance
existing
or
applied
for.”
under
the
act
“consumers
can
sue
businesses
that
fail
to
comply
and
if
the
business’
violation
is
willful
the
effected
the
consumer
is
entitled
to
actual
statutory
and
punitive
damages.”
geico
the
petitioner
in
number
06-100
took
respondent
edo’s
credit
score
into
account
when
it
issued
him
a
new
insurance
policy.
since
the
rate
that
edo
received
was
the
same
he
would
have
gotten
if
geico
had
not
looked
at
his
credit
score
at
all,
the
geico
did
not
send
him
an
“adverse
action”
notice.
edo
sued
geico
alleging
that
it
had
willfully
violated
the
act’s
notice
requirement
but
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
geico.
safeco
the
petitioner
in
06-84
also
took
credit
information
into
account
when
it
issued
new
insurance
policies
to
respondents
charles
burr,
and
shannon
massey.
since
safeco
did
not
think
that
the
notice
requirement
applied
to
initial
rates
of
a
new
insurance
it
did
not
give
them
notice.
burr
and
massey
joined
a
proposed
class
action
against
safeco
alleging
willful
violation
of
the
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
safeco.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
both
cases.
it
held
that
an
“adverse
action”
occurs
whenever
a
consumer
would
have
gotten
a
lower
rate
if
his
credit
score
had
been
more
favorable
and
that
the
notice
requirement
applies
to
initial
charges
for
new
insurance
policies.
it
also
held
that
an
insurer
willfully
fails
to
comply
with
the
act
if
it
acts
with
“reckless
disregard”
of
the
act’s
requirements
and
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
both
cases
for
further
proceedings.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
judgments
in
both
cases.
where
willfulness
is
a
statutory
condition
of
civil
liability,
we
have
taken
it
to
cover
not
only
knowing
violations
of
a
standard,
but
reckless
ones
as
well.
this
construction
is
consistent
with
common
law
usage.
since
congress
was
presumably
aware
of
the
background
and
didn’t
point
in
a
different
direction
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
the
willful
failure
covers
reckless
violations
of
the
act.
we
also
agree
that
an
initial
rate
charged
for
new
insurance
can
be
an
increase
in
an
insurance
charge
as
the
act
uses
that
term
in
“adverse
action”
requiring
notice.
this
reading
fits
with
the
act’s
broad
statement
of
purpose
and
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
meant
to
distinguish
newly
insured
from
renewal
applicants
in
this
context.
notice
is
not
required
however
unless
the
credit
report
is
a
necessary
condition
of
the
increase.
this
is
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
act’s
based
on
language
and
congress
probably
meant
to
prompt
consumer
challenges
only
when
the
consumer
would
gain
something,
if
the
challenge
succeeded.
this
conclusion
leads
us
to
hold
that
the
comparative
baseline
for
determining
whether
an
initial
rate
is
a
disadvantageous
increase,
is
what
the
applicant
would
have
gotten,
if
his
credit
report
had
not
been
considered,
this
we
think
best
reflects
the
concern
for
practical
consequences
that
congress
showed
in
adopting
the
causation
requirement.
therefore,
edo
was
not
entitled
to
notice
and
geico
didn’t
violate
the
act.
safeco
on
the
other
hand
may
have
violated
the
act
but
we
find
that
if
it
did
it
did
not
act
recklessly.
the
common
law
regards
“recklessness”
as
conduct
entailing
an
objectively
high
risk
of
harm,
which
here
would
be
a
risk
of
course
of
violating
the
act.
safeco
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
guidance
from
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
federal
trade
commission
and
his
reading
of
the
act
had
a
reasonable
foundation
in
the
statutory
text.
since
we
cannot
say
that
safeco’s
reading
was
even
objectively
unreasonable
it
falls
well
short
of
raising
the
high
risk
of
violating
the
act
necessary
for
reckless
liability.
