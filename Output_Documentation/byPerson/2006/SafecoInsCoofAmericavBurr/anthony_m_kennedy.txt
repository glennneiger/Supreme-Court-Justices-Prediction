i
have
just
two,
two
questions
on,
on
willful
and
then...
because
you
may
want
to
talk
about
the
other
issue
in
the
case.
first,
you
began
by
saying
that
here
a
district
judge
has
come
to
the
contrary
conclusion;
by
definition,
it
can't
be
reckless.
do
you
have
any
authority,
where
we...
for
that
proposition,
where
we
have
said
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
find
all
the
time
that
a
right
is
not
clearly
established
under
aedpa,
and
so
forth...
and
disregard
what
i
just
said.
that's
my
first
question.
and
the
second
is
willfully,
as
screws
itself
makes
very
clear,
it
is
interpreted
differently
in
the
criminal
context
than
it
is
in
the
civil
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
did
they
use
credit
reports?
is
it
just
a
hedge
against
late
premiums
and
the
cost
of
late
premiums,
or
does
it
bear
on
risk
factors
generally?
