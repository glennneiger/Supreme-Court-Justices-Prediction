justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
say
it's
all
right
to
use
the
model
penal
code
definition
of
reckless,
which
is
basically
what
you...
taking
it
here,
you
would
have
to
consciously
disregard
a
substantial
and
unjustifiable
risk
that
the
action
is
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
come
across
anything
that
would
use
that,
i
mean
"reckless"
itself
is
unclear.
the
model
penal
code
tried
to
clarify
it
based
on
this
court's
opinions
primarily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
said
there
is
no
way
they
couldn't
have
been
conscious
of
the
risk
here.
i
mean,
after
all,
that's
why
they
went
to
lawyers.
they
know
there's
risk
that
this
is
unlawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
consciousness,
i
mean,
maybe
it
should
come
in
in
the
standard,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
would
help
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
how
the
statute
defines
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
says
an
adverse
action
is
an
increase
in
a
charge
for...
in
connection
with
underwriting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
says.
and
then
it
says
an
increase
is...
and
if
you
take
an
adverse
action,
i.e.,
if
you
increase
it,
and
your
increase
is
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
information
contained
in
a
consumer
report,
you
have
to
send
the
thing.
how
did
you
get...
in
your
example,
there
was
no
increase.
i
mean,
in
a
charge.
in
your
salary,
it's
a
decrease
in
the
salary.
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
unfavorable
change
in
terms,
unfavorable
change
in
terms.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
you
don't
have,
you
don't
have
any
terms
because
you
never
did
it
before.
there's
no
change
in
terms.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
those
words
"change
in
terms"
refer
to
rates,
in
other
words?
that's
a
rather
odd
way
to
refer
to
it.
in
one
place,
you
refer
to
an
"increase";
in
the
other
place,
you'd
refer
to
it
as
a
"change
in
terms".
that's
sort
of
an
odd
way
to
write
a
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
understand
that.
but
what
we're
after
is
this.
everybody
has
a
credit
report,
just
about.
you
put
it
in
and
you
give
people
the
best
possible
rate
conceivable,
and
now,
how
do
you
know
that
maybe
there
could
have
still
been
a
better
rate?
and
it
can't
be
that
the
statute
intends
you
to
send
out
notices
in
such
circumstances
or
you'd
have
to
send
notices
whenever
you
read
a
credit
report.
now,
i
think
that's,
i've
overstated
slightly,
but
that's
basically
the
argument.
so
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
your
response
is
just
to
repeat
my
question
and
say
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
could
that
be?
i
mean
i
agree
that
the
statute
is
clear,
but
i
think
it's
clear
the
other
way.
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
language,
as
you've
just
heard,
if
you
look
at
the
purpose
it's
very
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
purpose
an
instance
where
a
person
has
continuous
accidents.
he's
a
reckless
driver.
his
insurance
company
puts
him
in
just
a
category
below
the
bottom
and
they
read
his
credit
report
and
they
discover,
despite
his
faults,
he
always
pays
his
bills
on
time.
so
they
increase
it,
not
to
the
top
category,
but
they
give
him
a
much
better
deal.
and
you're
saying
this
statute
means
that
what
i
just
described
is
an
adverse
action
based
on
a
credit
report?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
and
then
if
you're
going
to
say
yes,
i
want
to
hear
why
yes,
and
then
in
light
of
the
following:
the
little
boy
who
says
wolf.
you're
probably
puzzled
what
i
mean
by
that.
i
mean
that
if
you're
right
in
that
interpretation,
there
will
be
tens
of
millions
of
notices
going
out
and
they'll
have
the
same
effect
on
the
public
that
these
privacy
notices
have
today.
we
get
them
every
day,
dozens
of
them,
and
they
go
right
in
the
wastebasket,
because
they
will
become
meaningless
because
to
an
average
person
that
notice
will
not
mean
that
he
better
look
at
his
credit
report.
it
will
mean
throw
it
in
the
wastebasket.
all
right,
now
i've
got
the
purpose,
i've
got
the
language,
and
i
have
what
i
think
of
as
common
sense.
now,
you
explain
why
it's
obvious
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
explain
it
because
if
you
have
an
increase
in
the
charge
based
on
race,
of
course
that's
an
increase
based
on
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
refuse
to
give
a
person
the
best
rate,
and
lower
his
rate
but
not
the
best
rate,
based
on
race,
that
is
not
an
increase
based
on
race.
that
is
discrimination
based
on
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
and
it's
a
discrimination,
but
you
didn't
increase
the
rate.
you
decreased
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
still
a
discrimination,
it's
still
unlawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
look
at
the
language.
go
back
to
give
me...
because
in
ordinary
english,
which
i
hope
i
speak,
it
is
not
an
increase,
but
maybe
there
is
a
technical
term
in
the
technical
language
of
commercial
law
or
in
ftc
law
where
the
word
increase
means
decrease.
and
if
you...
is
there
anything
you
want...
no.
it's
a
serious
question,
at
least
if
you
want
to
cite
me
to
some
authority
that
uses
this
word
increase
in
the
way
you
just
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
dictionary
shall
i
look
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
that
you're
talking
linguistically,
but
i
am
interested
in
the
purpose.
so
i
looked
up
on
the
internet
approximately
what
percent
of
the
people
have
the
best
credit
score
and
that's
about
1
percent.
so
99
percent
of
the
public
doesn't
have
the
best
possible
credit
score.
now
i
take
it
that
means
that
you
could
in
fact,
if
it's
even
roughly
right,
have
99
percent
or
a
little
less
or
even
perhaps
a
little
more
when
they
look
at
that
report
that,
since
it's
not
perfect
in
99
percent
of
the
cases,
it's
quite
possible
that
they
won't
get
the
best
conceivable
rate
which
might
be
reserved
for
just
perfect
people.
and
if
that's
so,
in
99
percent
of
the
cases
they'll
send
out
notices.
and
that's
why
i
asked
my
question
about
the
boy
who
calls
wolf.
what
will
happen
if
99
percent
of
the
people
who
apply
for
insurance
or
any
other
thing
get
notices?
i
suspect
that
this
is
only
intuitive,
that
the
notices
are
more
likely
to
go
into
the
wastebasket
than
they
are
if
there
was
really
a
decrease.
now,
do
you
have
any
light
you
can
shed
on
that?
