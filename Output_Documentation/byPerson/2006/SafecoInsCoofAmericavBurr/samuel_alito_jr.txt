since
the
term
knowingly
or
knowing
appears
in
two
places
in
1681n,
can't
we
infer
from
that
that
willfully
in
that
provision
also
means
something
different?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
statute
says
what
the
permissible
purposes
are.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
more,
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
adverse
action
there
has
to
be
an
increase
or
an
unfavorable
change.
and
when
you
have
an
initial
application
you
have
to
figure
out
what
is
the
baseline
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
an
increase
or
an
adverse
action.
and
you
and
the
solicitor
general
just
assert
that
the
baseline
in
that
situation
is
the
best
possible
rate
that
you
can
get,
but
i
don't
understand
where
that
comes
from.
