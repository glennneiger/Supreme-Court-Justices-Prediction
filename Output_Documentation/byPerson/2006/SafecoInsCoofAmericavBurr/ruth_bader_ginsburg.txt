is
it
really
billions?
how
many
of
these
have
been
certified
as
class
actions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you,
would
you,
as
representative
of
the
insurers,
would
you
have
a
sound
objection
to
class
action
certification
in
these
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
gone
to,
gone
to
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
question
how
many
will
sue
for
a
thousand
dollars,
given
the
litigation
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
haven't...
neither
has
been
certified,
has
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
different
question.
we've
been
talking
about
willful
up
to
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
haven't
addressed
adverse
action
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but,
was
there
anything
further
on
willful?
you
said
that
the
statute
was
clear
enough
and
you
had
the
ftc
informal
advice,
but
now
we
know
that
courts
have
divided
on
this
question,
right?
