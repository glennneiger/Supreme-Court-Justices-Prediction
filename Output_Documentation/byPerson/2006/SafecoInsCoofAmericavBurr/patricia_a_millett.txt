ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
willfulness
in
the
civil
context,
as
is
used
here,
includes
a
reckless
disregard
component
or
a
recklessness
component.
that
is
what
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
that
have
similar
uses
of
willfulness
focused
on
a
departure
from
the
law,
have
held.
thurston,
richland
shoe
and
hazen
paper
are
the
three
that
have
been
most
discussed
in
the
case,
in
the
papers
here.
but
where
the
ninth
circuit
misstepped
here
was
in
the
application
of
that
standard.
and
in
particular,
we
agreed
with
petitioners
that
when
it
concluded
that
a
creative
but
unlikely
position
constitutes
recklessness,
it
erred.
recklessness
speaks
an
extreme
deviation
from
an
ordinary
standard
of
care.
it
requires
that
the
defendant
act
in
the
face
of
or
fail
to
act--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
has
both
in
this
context.
it
is,
i
think,
first
and
foremost,
an
objective
component,
because
there
is...
this
is
a
civil
case.
it's
not
purely
subjective.
and
that
objective
component
is
very
important
because
that
is
what
makes
the
act
or
inaction
reckless,
and
that
is
the
risk.
there
has
to
be
an
objectively
high
and
obvious
risk.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
to
the
extent
you're
talking
about
dollar
liability,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
do
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
recklessness
generally
in
the
tort
law,
the
more
serious
an
injury
that
could
result,
can...
we'll
tolerate
less
risk.
if
the
risk
is
causing
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
to
somebody,
we'll...
the
law
will
tolerate
a
lesser
degree
of
risk
than
it
will
if,
if
it's
simply
causing,
you
know,
a
delay
in
something
or
a
sort
of
paper
injury
or
maybe
even
a
dollar
injury.
and
it's
not
set.
it's
a
variable
calculation.
so
in
that
sense,
it
is.
i
don't
think
that
when
we
talk
about
a
high
and
objective
risk
in
this
context,
we
are
talking
about
the
dollars
that
a,
that
a
company
would
have
to
pay,
although
i'm
sure
they
are
interested
in
hearing
about
that
from
their
lawyers.
what
we
are
talking
about
here...
and
this
is
a
very
unusual
statute
the
way
it's
written...
the
liability
itself,
not
just
the
damages,
but
the
liability
itself
turns
upon
the
extent
of
departure
from
law.
you
have
to...
there
is
no
recovery
here
like
there
is
in
almost...
or
commonly
in
federal
statutes
for
just
a
violation.
that
isn't
it.
you
have
to
show
either
a
willful
violation
or
a
negligent
violation,
and
that
requires
a
determination
not
only
that
the
defendants
violated
the
law,
but
a
determination
as
to
how
much,
how
far,
how
many
standard
deviations
from
correct
their
position
was
and
that
is
an
objective
determination.
once
an
objectively
high
risk
has
been
found
by
a
court,
then...
then
the
case
can
shift
to
looking
into
subjective
things.
i
think
a
plaintiff
would
be
entitled,
once
an
objectively
high
and
obvious
risk
has
been
found
by
the
court,
to
rely
on
that,
and
allow
a
jury
to,
or
a
judge,
whoever
is
deciding
the
case,
to
infer
the
existence
of
willfulness
from
that.
and
that's
often
when
defendants...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
we
agree
with
respondents
on
the
meaning
of
adverse
action.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
it's
a
complicated
answer,
in
part
because
that
assumes
that
you
have
an
existing
account
and
you're
not
an
initial
account
here.
and
when
you
have
an
existing
account,
there's
a
definition
of
adverse
action
for
insurance
provisions,
but
in
iv
there
is
a
separate,
there's
another
definition,
and
this
is
on,
on
page...
sorry.
excuse
me.
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
iv
under
big
i...
i'm
sorry,
there's
a
lot
of
provisions...
talks
about
reviewing
an
existing
account,
and
it
cross-referenced
another
provision
which
talks
about
reviewing
an
account
for
purposes
of
termination.
and
that
would
include,
in
our
view,
not
only
completely
canceling
it,
but
terminating
the
existing
and
charging
you
more
for
allowing
you
now
to
pay
a
new
rate.
so
which
would
govern
in
that
particular
context
is
a
little
bit
harder.
but
it
could,
and
here's
logically
why,
because
i
think
the
understanding
of
"increase"
that's
at
issue
here
is
one
that's
very
basic
to
the
operation
of
this
statute,
and
that
is,
did
the
content
of
your
information
in
your
credit
report,
if
it
had
been
better,
could
you
have
had
a
better
rate
or
a
better
deal.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
so
have
you
been
hit
in
the
pocketbook.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
could
have,
and
here...
in
this
sense,
it
could
be:
in
the
same
way
that
i,
sort
of
the
flip
side,
but
in
my
office,
if
everybody
in
the
hallway
gets
a
5
percent
salary
increase
and
i
only
get
a
1
percent
salary
increase,
i
am
certainly
better
off,
but
if
the
reason
i
got
a
lesser
increase
is
because
of
my
gender
or
because
of
my
credit
report,
it's
an
adverse
action.
so
the
fact
that
you're
doing
somewhat
better
doesn't
mean--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--excuse
me?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
it
also--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
definition
again
on
3a
includes
not
just
increase,
but
includes
an
unfavorable
change
in
the
terms.
and
so
it's
not
settled
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--exactly.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
you're
a
new
customer...
and
again,
i
want
to
reiterate
that,
how
this
applies
to
existing
accounts
is
complicated--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
you
can
have
a
change
in
terms
that
is
not
necessarily
an
increase.
it
could
be
you
will
no
longer
be
entitled
to
a
free
rental
car
when
your
car
is
in
for
repair
for
some
reason.
that's
not
an
increase.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
justice
breyer,
my
response
is
that
if
the
content
of
the
information
in
your
credit
report
would
have
made
you...
had
it
been
better
information
you'd
have
gotten
a
better
rate,
a
better
result,
your
pocketbook
wouldn't
have
been
hit
as
hard,
you
have
a
dollars
and
cents
injury
because
of
the
content
of
the
information,
then
you
had
an
adverse
action.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
if
i
could
continue
on
that,
if
i
could
add
on,
if
i
could
add
on,
the
way
insurance
companies
work
is
they
don't
have
3
million
customers
and
3
million
rates.
they
have
ranges
and
most
of
them
will
have
a
top
tier.
they
may
have
specialized
things
for
employees,
but
putting
aside
a
specialized
category,
there's
a
top
range
and
they
will
tell
you,
as
they
say
in
the
briefs,
that
10
to
15
percent
of
people
fit
in
there.
so
they
know
what
the
best
rate
is.
they
know
what
the
next,
above
average
rate,
the
standard
rate.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
to
begin
with,
that
may
be
why
petitioners'
position
here
certainly
was
not
reckless
and
the
ninth
circuit
erred.
but
we
do
think
that
the
statutory
language
read
as
a
whole
supports
this.
it
could
be
a
denial
of
a
particular
term
in
an
insurance
contract.
but
you
have
to
look
at...
it's
important
to
understand
you
look--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--or
it
could
be
a
reduction
in
the
terms.
i
mean,
these
things
are
statutory
construction
issues
to
be
litigated,
and
the
important
issue
here...
and
they
are
presented
in
this
case.
they're
to
be
litigated
and
the
important
issue
is
that
when
there
is
fair
debate
about
these
issues
insurance
companies
will
not
be
held
to
be
willfully
violating
the
statute
if
they
got
the
answer
wrong.
but
i
think
on
the,
on
the
substantive
question,
it's
important
to
read
"adverse
action"
in
light
of,
if
i
could
just
finish
the
sentence,
in
light
of
the
definition
of
when
a
notice
is
required
to
be
issued,
which
turns
upon
the
content
of
the
information
in
the
report.
thank
you.

patricia
a.
