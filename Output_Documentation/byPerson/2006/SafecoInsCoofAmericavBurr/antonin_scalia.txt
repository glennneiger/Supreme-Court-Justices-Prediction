well,
it's
also
used
in
the
phrase
"knowing
and
willfully".
that
appears
in
several
other
parts
of
the
statute,
and
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense
if
the
only
meaning
of
willful
is
knowing.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
one
formulation
or
another,
but
it
combines
the
two
words,
knowing
and
willful.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
willfully
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
it...
where
it
means
what
you
think
it
means,
which
is
knowingly,
that
does
not
mean
knowing
the
facts?
if
you
mistake
the
facts
and
are
laboring
under
a
misimpression
of
the
facts,
you
have
nonetheless
willfully
violated
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
reckless
disregard?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
there
is
a
fair
ground
for
believing
it
was
lawful.
lawyers
are
in
disagreement,
but
in
fact,
i
believe
the
lawyers
who
say
it
is
unlawful,
and
i
nonetheless
go
ahead
and
do
it.
is
that
a
willful
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
i'm
violating.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
a
better
lawyer
than
my
advisors.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
look
to
the
subjective
intent
of
the
actor
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
would
you
just
look
to
the
outcome
and
say,
well,
you
know,
it
was
a
close
question,
so
even
if
the
actor
indeed
thought
he
was
in
violation,
it
was
a
close
question;
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
that...
that
is
not
the
normal
meaning
of
willful,
willfully
violating
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
changing
it
to
mean
willfully,
willfully
and
blatantly
violating
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
i
know
that
what
i'm
doing
is
in
violation
of
the
law,
even
if
it's
a
close
question,
it
seems
to
me
i
am
willfully
violating
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
fit,
how
do
you
fit
that
within
the
language
of
the
statute?
is
it,
i
fail...
you're
a
first-time
customer
and
i
fail
to
give
you
a,
you
know,
a
break
that
maybe
you
could
have
had.
is
it
a
denial
or
cancellation
of
insurance?
no.
is
it
an
increase
in,
an
increase
in
any
charge
for
insurance?
is
it
a
reduction
or
other
adverse
or
unfavorable
change
in
the
terms
of
coverage
or
in
the
amount
of
any
insurance?
i
find
it
hard
to
shoehorn
your
case
into
that
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
read
the
term
as,
as
one
of
the
justices
here
does,
not
referring
to
the
rate.
the
earlier
part
refers
to
the
rate.
an
increase
in
any
charge
for,
that's
the
rate.
and
then
it
speaks
of
change
in
the
terms
of
coverage.
i
mean,
that
is,
you
know,
whether
it
covers
hurricanes,
or
in
the
amount
of
the
insurance,
whether
you're
insured
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
sloppy
lawyering,
don't
you
think,
any
action
that
even
be
considered
to
have...
wow.
this
is
a
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
action
that
can
even
be
considered
to
have
a
negative
impact.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
guidance?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
i
would
tell
my
ceo
ignore
that,
that
it's
meaningless.
