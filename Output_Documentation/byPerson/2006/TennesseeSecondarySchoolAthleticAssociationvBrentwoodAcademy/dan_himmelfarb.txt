mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
deciding
brentwood's
first
amendment
claim.
this
court's
decisions
establish
that
when
the
government
offers
a
benefit
that
a
citizen
is
free
to
reject,
it
has
much
greater
leeway
in
regulating
speech
than
when
it
exercises
its
coercive
sovereign
power.
as
in
cases
where
the
government
acts
as
an
employer,
a
contractor,
a
property
owner,
a
service
provider
or
a
benefactor,
the
tssaa
offers
a
benefit,
access
to
organized
athletic
competition,
that
a
school
may
decline
by
choosing
not
to
become
a
member
of
the
association.
brentwood's
first
amendment
challenge
to
the
tssaa
recruiting
rule,
therefore,
is
subject
to
deferential
review.
deferential
first
amendment
review
is
appropriate
in
these
contexts
because
the
government
occupies
a
middle
ground
when
it
is
not
exercising
its
sovereign
authority.
on
the
one
hand
the
government
remains
the
government
no
matter
what
authority
it's
exercising...
so
it
is
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
first
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
government
acts
in
a
non-sovereign
capacity,
its
position
is
comparable
to
that
of
private
sector
entities
and
it
has
to
be
able
to
make
the
same
sorts
of
decisions
that
they
make.
it
has
to
be
able
to
decide
what
conduct
is
acceptable
in
its
workplace,
what
activities
may
take
place
on
its
property,
and
the
uses
to
which
its
grant
money
may
be
put.
so
the
first
amendment
can't
apply
with
the
same
force
as
when
the
government
acts
in
its
sovereign
capacity.
for
example,
a
government
agency
can
tell
its
employees
not
to
use
offensive
language
with
co-workers
or
customers,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
plurality
opinion
in
waters
versus
churchill,
and
that
prohibition
would
not
be
subject
to
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny.
so,
too,
an
athletic
association
can
tell
the
students
at
its
member
schools
that
they
can't
use
offensive
language
in
dealing
with
opposing
players
or
referees,
as
indeed
the
tssaa
bylaws
in
fact
do.
this
is
at
page
202
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
that
prohibition
should
not
be
subject
to
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny
either.
the
same
is
true
of
other
rules
that
govern
membership
in
and
define
the
character
of
a
voluntary
athletic
association.
as
applied
to
tssaa's
recruiting
rule,
the
deferential
standard
of
review
is
easily
satisfied.
prohibiting
the
use
of
undue
influence
in
recruiting
or
attempting
to
secure
or
retain
high
school
athletes
we
think
is
self-evidently
reasonable
in
light
of
the
purposes
underlying
the
rule,
which
include
preventing
the
exploitation
of
children
and
ensuring
that
sports
remains
subordinate
to
academics.
prohibiting
coaches
from
contacting
students
who
have
not
enrolled
at
the
coach's
school
is
likewise
reasonable.
either
because
that
prohibition
can
reasonably
be
reviewed
as
an
instance
of
undue
influence
itself,
or
because
it
is
a
reasonable
prophylactic
measure
to
prevent
the
exertion
of
undue
influence.
and
finally
defining
enrollment
in
the
context
of
the
prohibition
on
coaches
contacting
students
to
exclude
the
situation
where
a
student
has
somehow
announced
its
intention...
announced
his
intention
to
attend
its
school,
for
example,
as
in
this
case
by
signing
an
enrollment
contract,
is
reasonable
as
well
for
the
reasons
ms.
mahoney
mentioned
in
responding
to
justice
souter's
question.
somebody
who
signs
an
enrollment
contract
may
not
decide...
may
ultimately
decide
to
attend
a
different
school,
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
students
sometimes
sign
multiple
enrollment
contracts
and
sometimes
decide
to
attend
a
different
school
after
signing
one.
this
is
at
page
240
of
the
joint
appendix
and
there
are
additional
citations
to
the
record
on
page
6
of
the
reply
brief.
in
short,
while
the
first
amendment
has
a
role
to
play
in
this
case
and
cases
like
it,
it
is
a
very
limited
role.
and
the
recruiting
rule
easily
satisfies
what
we
think
is
the
appropriately
deferential
standard
of
review
that
applies
in
circumstances
of
this
type.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
that
would
be
close
to
the
line,
justice
stevens.
the...
the
prohibition
on
coach
contact
we
think
is
an
easy
case.
there
are,
in
fact,
ways
that
schools
can
communicate--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
if
it
is
a
brochure
sent
out
by
the
school
generally
and
it
doesn't
target
specific
students
and
it
went
out
to
schools
generally,
and
there
was
a
prohibition
on
that
type
of
thing,
i
think
that
might
very
well
be
a
reasonable
restriction
on
speech.
as
i
say,
i
think
this
that's
close--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--it
might
be...
well,
i
think
it's
close
enough
to
the
line
that
it
could
go
either
way.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
the...
in
that
situation,
i
think...
i
think
it
probably
would
be
unreasonable,
mr.
chief
justice.
the,
the...
the
methods
of...
the
alternative
methods
of
speech
here
are
not
all
that
different...
that
are
allowed
by
the
rule
here...
are
not
all
that
different
from
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
schools
can
communicate
with
prospective
students
and
their
families
about
athletics
at
the
school,
but
it's
usually
done
through
intermediaries.
and
i
think
as
i
say,
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
is
not--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
that
would
be
much
more
problematic.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
this
rule
prohibits
that.
and
i
don't
think
it
prohibits
justice
stevens'
example.
what
the
rule
allows
is
for
schools
to
send
out
information
about
their
athletic
programs
to
other
schools
to
distribute
to
their
students,
for
example.
it
also
allows
them
to
send
it
out
to
real
estate
brokers,
to
athletic
leagues
that
aren't
associated
with
the
school,
to
advertise.
it
allows
it
to
respond
to
direct
inquiries
from
students.
but
i
think
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
pretty
close
to
the
sorts
of
things
that
are
allowed
by
this
recruiting
rule.
and
i
do
agree
with
you
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--right.
i...
i...
i
think
that
if
the,
if
the...
if
the
recruiting
rule...
if
there
were
a
recruiting
rule
that
prohibited
those
types--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--of
course.
there
is,
we
think
there
is
a
reasonableness
or
germaneness
limitation.
the
justifications
for
the
rule
are
mainly
preventing
the
exploitation
of
students
and
ensuring
that
academics...
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--sure.
under...
under
a
reasonableness
standard,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
the
justifications
for
the
rule
and
ask
whether
if
the...
the
rule
reasonably
furthers
those
interests.
and,
and
in
making
that
determination--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
right.
i
think
you,
if
you...
if
you
offered
those
justifications
for
banning
the
type
of
speech
you
suggested,
it
might
very
well
be
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
conclude
that
the
rule
isn't
reasonably
related
to
those
justifications
because
it
burdens
too
much
speech.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
in
the
types
of
cases
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
employment
cases,
funding
cases,
property,
ownership
cases,
i
mean
there's
no
dispute
that
in
those
cases
the
government
is
a
state
actor.
when
the
government
employs
people
it
is
a
state
actor
subject
to
the
first
amendment,
but
deferential
review
is
applied
to
first
amendment
challenges
because
there
is
a
choice.
and
so
too
here
there
is
a
choice
for
the
reasons
mentioned
by
ms.
mahoney.
there
are
other
athletic
associations
that
schools
can
join.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i
think...
i'm
not
sure
that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
in
this
court's
decisions
in
various
areas
applying
deferential
first
amendment
review,
when
there's
a
voluntary
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
citizen,
that
is
precisely
the
reason
that
the
court
applies
deferential
review.
