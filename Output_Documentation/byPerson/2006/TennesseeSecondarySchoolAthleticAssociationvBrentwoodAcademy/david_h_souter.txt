justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mahoney,
on
that
point,
can
i
just
take
you
back
to
square
one
for
a
second?
i'm
with
you
in
your
explanation
that
the
speech
at
issue
here
probably
was
fairly
understood
as
being
for,
you
know,
the
communication
here
as
being
a
violation
of
the
rule.
could
you,
though,
tell
me,
would
it
have
been...
i
guess
i
have
two
questions.
would
it
have
been
a
violation
of
the
rule
if
the
coach
had
sent
the
letter
to
eighth
grade
students
in
the
school
itself,
those
who
were
already
formally
enrolled
and
who
might
be
going
out
for
football
the
next
fall?
and
number
two,
what
is
exactly
the
interest
in
preventing
recruiting,
as
you
describe
it,
when
the
letters
are
aimed
at
people
who
have
already
signed,
i
think
you
referred
to
it
as,
an
enrollment
contract?
so
there's
every
reason
to
believe
they're
going
to
be
in
that
school
next
year.
what
is
the
interest?
and
would
that
interest
have
supported
a
ban
on
letters
to
the
already
enrolled
eighth
grade
kids?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
they
had
signed
up
to
go
to
brentwood.
so
where
does
the
recruiting
come
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
boils
down
to
saying
that
when
they've
signed
the
enrollment
contract
that's
not
the
end
of
the,
in
effect,
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
is
a
sensible
practical
way
in
which
recruiting
goes
on
even
among
those
who
have
signed
up.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
blumstein,
it
seems
to
me
that
ms.
mahoney
addressed
that
in
response
to
a
question
from
me.
i
said,
in
effect,
that
once
a
student
has
signed
an
enrollment
contract,
where
is
there
any
recruiting
going
on?
and
she
said
there
is
recruiting,
and
hence
there
is
an
interest
in
regulating
recruiting,
because
not
everybody
who
signs
these
contracts,
or
on
behalf
of
whom
those
contracts
are
signed,
end
up
going
to
the
school.
so
that
in
fact,
there
is
room
for
recruiting
right
up
to
the
moment
that
the
kid
arrives
in
the
fall
and
signs
on
the
dotted
line.
what
is
your
response
to
her
response?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
many
cases
have
there
got
to
be
before
you
would
recognize
the
sufficiency
of
the
asserted
state
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
know
that.
they've
signed
the
contract.
so
that's
where
we
start.
and
you're
saying,
well,
only
about
5
percent
of
them
weasel
out
of
it
later
on
and
go
to
some
other
school.
but
why
is
5
percent
insufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
the
kid
comes
and
says,
look,
i'm
going
to
brentwood
next
fall
and
i'd
like
to
tag
along
to
a
spring
practice,
they
say
okay.
but
that's
not
recruiting.
the
school
hasn't
initiated
it.
in
this
case,
the
school
has
initiated
it
by
the
letter.
and
it
does
sound
like
recruiting
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
students
aren't
bound
to
go
to
the
school
even
though
their
parents
signed
up
and
some
of
them
don't.
so
i
come
back
to
my
question.
if
taking
your
figure...
let's
assume
that
only
5
percent,
in
fact,
change
their
minds.
why
doesn't...
why
isn't
there
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
recruiting
within
the
5
percent?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
would
you
answer
my
question?
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it
certainly
can
do
that.
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
line
that
is
being
drawn
is
a
line
between
contact
which
is
initiated
by
the
prospective
student
and
proselytizing
which
is
initiated
by
the
school.
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
what
we've
got
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we're
still
talking
about
athletic
contact.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
maybe
that
would
present
a
different
kind
of
problem,
but
that's
not
what
we've
got
here.
what
we've
got
here
is
contact
through
speech
that
was
initiated
by
the
coach.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
am
saying
that
if
the
rule
generally...
maybe
quite
imprecisely...
but
if
it
generally
distinguishes
between
that
kind
of
proselytizing
by
a
coach,
and
on
the
other
hand
contact
that
a
kid
initiates
in
the
first
place,
isn't
that
roughly
a
fair
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
activity
being
tagging
along
to
spring
practice?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
answer
to
that
is,
they're
not
trying
to
prevent
people,
at
least
under
this
rule,
they're
not
trying
to
prevent
8th
grade
kids
from
going
to
spring
practice.
they're
trying
to
prevent
coaches
from
proselytizing
kids,
and
that's
the
distinction.
why
isn't
it
a
reasonable
distinction?
