may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question,
ms.
mahoney?
and
that
is,
we
are
told
that
at
the
time
this
issue
arose,
the
practice
itself
was
all
right,
and
it
was
all
right
for
one
school
to
invite
students
from
another
school
to
join
the
invitee
school's
practice.
and
now
i
take
it
that
it's
no
longer
permissible,
that
one
school's,
one
school's
practice,
is
reserved
for
its
own
students
and
not...
others
are
not
invited.
but
if
it
was
permissible
under
the
association's
rules
to
invite
students
from
other
schools,
then
why
is
it
impermissible
to
talk
it
up?
i
mean,
you
can
do
it,
but
you
can't
talk
about
it?

ruth

but
then
that's
part
of
the
trophy,
whatever
it
is
when
you
win
at
the
end
of
the
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
fine
has
not
been
paid.
the
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blumstein,
there's
one
feature
of
this
that
i
find
puzzling.
you're
making
this
a
first
amendment
case.
but
you
joined
an
association
that
has
such,
certain
rules
and
when
one
joins,
one
agrees
to
abide
by
the
rules.
nothing
in
the
world
stops
brentwood
from
saying
this
anti-recruiting
rule
is
a
really
bad
rule,
it
is
unfair
to
us;
you
could
have
written
op
ed
pieces
about
it,
the
school
could
have
talked
about
it,
the
school
could
have
urged
the
board
of
education
to
drop
it.
nothing
stopped
you
from
attacking
this
rule
that
you
don't
like.
but
when
you
signed
on,
the
first
amendment
doesn't
give
you
license
not
to
follow
the
rules
that
you
disagree
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
part
of
what
you
agree
to
is
a
organization
that
has
a
certain
governance
structure,
the
people
in
the
organization
decide,
and
then
make
public
to
all
the
members
of
the
association
what
the
rules
are
and
how
they're
going
to
be
interpreted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blumstein,
you're
making
that
distinction.
is
there...
if
the
association
says
no
school
in
this
association
can
invite
students
enrolled
in
other
schools
to
its
practice,
that's
okay?
because
that's
conduct,
right?
if
this
is
your
statement,
there's
nothing
to
recruit
for,
because
we
don't
allow
it
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
little
odd,
isn't
it,
that
they
could
do...
they
could
take
the
stronger
measure
but
not
the
lesser
measure
of
saying
it's
available
but
we
don't
want
you
to
broadcast
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
fair
to
say
"your
coach"?
the
letter
was
signed
by
your
coach,
not
just
coach.
