justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
what
is
your
response
to
the,
one
of
your
earlier
questions.
suppose
they
sent
out
a
general
brochure
to
all
the
graduating
grammar
school
students
to...
advertising
that
they
come
up
to
brentwood
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
the
rule
prohibited
that?
would
that
rule
be
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
coach
recruiting
just
a
subcategory
of
a
broader--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not
asking
you
about
the
school
for
the
rule.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what's
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
protection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
agree
at
some
point
the
first
amendment
would
prohibit
some
kind
of
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
permissible,
in
weighing
the...
both
sides
of
the
equation
to
consider
the
advantages...
i
mean
the
justifications
for
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--justification
for
the
rule
in
this
case
and
the
justification
for
the
rule
that
would
prohibit
the
general
solicitation
i
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
same
justification,
but
the
justification
is
a
little
stronger
in
one
hypo
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blumstein,
am
i
not
correct
for
purposes
of
our
decision,
if
you're
claiming
constitutional
protection,
you're
claiming
that
you'd
be
constitutionally
protected
even
if
you
knew
in
advance
that
this
particular
communication
would
violate
the
rule
and
even
if
you
did
it
deliberately?
that's
what
your
constitutional
position
is,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
or
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
what
really,
you're...
it
is
sort
of
a
side
issue
as
to
whether
they
really
had
adequate
notice
and
so
forth,
insofar
as
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
claim
was
that
you
had
a
witness
available
to
testify,
but
you
didn't
put
him
on
because
you
didn't
think
they
were
going
into
this
issue.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
one
of
the
decisionmakers
testify
that
they
relied
on
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
one
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
not
the
district
court
find
that
his
testimony
was
credible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association
which
i
will
refer
to
us
tssaa
is
an
association
of
high
schools
that
regulates
interscholastic
sports
among
its
members
including
brentwood
academy,
a
private
school.
tssaa
prohibits
its
members
from
using
undo
influence
in
recruiting
middle
school
students
for
their
athletic
programs.
in
april
1997,
brentwood’s
football
coach
sent
a
letter
to
several
eighth-grade
boys
inviting
them
to
attend
spring
practice
sessions.
the
letter
explained
that
football
equipment
would
be
distributed
and
they
getting
involved
as
soon
as
possible
would
definitely
be
to
your
advantage.
it
was
signed
“your
coach”.
even
though,
none
of
the
boys
had
yet
enrolled
within
the
meaning
of
the
tssaa
rules.
as
the
case
comes
to
us
it
is
settled
that
the
coach’s
pre-enrolment
solicitation
violated
the
tssaa
anti-recruiting
rule
and
that
he
had
ample
notice
that
his
conduct
was
prohibited.
tssaa
accordingly,
sanctioned
brentwood.
after
proceeding
through
two
layers
of
internal
tssaa
review
brentwood
brought
this
action
against
tssaa
and
its
executive
director
in
federal
court
under
42
u.s.c.
§1983.
as
relevant
here
brentwood
made
two
claims.
first,
that
the
enforcement
of
the
rule
was
state
action
that
violated
the
first
amendment
and
second
that
the
adjudication
by
the
association
violated
fair
procedural
rules.
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
found
for
brentwood
on
both
accounts,
we
reverse.
in
part
i,
of
our
opinion
we
described
the
history
of
the
case.
in
part
ii,
we
discussed
the
first
amendment
issue.
in
part
ii-a
which
is
joined
only
by
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer,
i
explain
that
the
anti-recruiting
rule
governs
person-to-person
solicitation
rather
than
speech
to
the
public
at
large.
in
part
ii-b,
speaking
for
the
court,
i
explained
that
brentwood
made
a
voluntary
decision
to
join
tssaa
and
to
abide
by
its
anti-recruiting
rule.
just
as
the
government’s
interest
in
running
an
effective
workplace
can
in
circumstances
outweigh
employee
speech
rights
so
too
in
an
athletic
league’s
interest
in
enforcing
its
rules
sometimes
warrants
curtailing
the
speech
of
its
voluntary
participants.
while
tssaa
may
not
have
unlimited
authority
to
condition
membership
on
the
relinquishment
of
any
and
all
constitutional
rights,
it
surely
may
impose
conditions
on
speech
that
are
necessary
to
regulate
an
efficient
and
effective
state-sponsored
high
school
athletic
league.
we
agree
with
tssaa
submission
that
hard-sell
tactics
directed
at
middle
school
students
could
distort
competition
between
high
school
teams,
and
foster
an
environment
in
which
athletics
are
prized
more
highly
than
academics.
the
first
amendment
does
not
excuse
brentwood
from
abiding
by
the
same
anti-recruiting
rules
that
govern
the
conduct
of
its
competitors.
part
iii
of
the
opinion
discuses
brentwood’s
claim
that
was
deprived
of
a
fair
hearing
because
the
tssaa
board
considered
certain
evidence
that
had
not
been
introduced
in
the
formal
hearing.
they
did
not
however
consider
anything
not
already
known
to
brentwood
or
prevent
or
deny
brentwood
a
full
opportunity
to
explain
the
relevant
facts.
if
there
was
a
due
process
violation
it
was
clearly
harmless.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
alito
have
joined.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
