mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
brentwood
academy
in
this
civil
rights
case.
it's
about
the
regulatory
overreaching
of
the
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association,
what
we
call
the
tssaa.
the
case
involves
the
first
amendment's
interest
of
the
school,
its
students,
its
parents,
and
the
procedural
due
process
interests.
brentwood
was
severely
punished,
and
the
punishment
is
listed
in
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
for
communicating
with
its
own
incoming
male
students,
informing
them
of
an
opportunity,
spring
football
practice,
that
the
students
were
authorized
to
attend
under
the
tssaa
rules.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
first
year
it
did
take
effect--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--and
the
second
year
did
not
take
effect,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
not
yet.
but
we've
recognized
that
if
this
turns
out
to
be...
if
the
tssaa
position
turns
out
to
be
vindicated,
the
school
will
be
obliged
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
say
that
there's
a
finding,
a
stipulation
that
the
school
thought
it
was
abiding
by
the
rule.
it
has
no
intent
to
violate
the
rule.
intent
is
not
a
requirement.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
your
honor,
let
me
first
address,
in...
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
a
two
page...
a
two-sentence
letter
from
joe
marley
to
brentwood
academy.
this
was
in
the
same
year
in
which
this
alleged
violation
occurred;
and
in
the
two-sentence
letter,
ray
marley,
the
student's
father,
said
it
is
our
attention
for
ray
to
attend
brentwood
academy
in
1997-98,
ray
has
my
consent
to
participate
in
the
speed
and
strength
program
at
brentwood
academy.
the
association
then
informed
the
school
that
it
was
able
to
allow
this
young
man
to
come
and
lift
weights
at
the
school
based
upon
that
letter.
so
when
the
school
wrote
a
letter
and
had
contact
with
the
student,
based
upon
an
enrollment
contract,
they
thought
it
was
an
a
fortiori
circumstance
that
if
they
could
have
ray
marley
lift
weights
and
be
there
and
contact
the
coach,
that
a
much
more
elaborate
contractual
enrollment
form
with
signing
of
a
contract
and
paying
a
$300
deposit
would
allow
them
to,
in
fact,
have
contact
with
the
coach.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
our...
your
honor,
the
significance
of
the
voluntariness--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor.
the
relevance
of
the
signing
up
and
the
voluntary
involvement
is
ultimately
whether
there's
a
waiver;
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
requirements
of
waiver
have
either
been
pled,
which
is
an
obligation,
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
has
not
been
pled.
this
has
never
been
treated
as
a
waiver
case.
it
was
not
in
the
very
beginning.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
and
both
are
governmental?
both
are
governmental,
justice
alito?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think
if
a
private
party
subjects
itself
voluntary,
voluntarily
to
a
regulatory
program
run
by
the
government
or
which
is
attributable
to
the
government,
then
under
cases
like
ibanez,
which
we
emphasize
in
our
brief,
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
apply
the
rules
fairly,
unless
there
is
a
waiver
of
some
kind,
the
waiver
standard
is
the
one
that
makes
a
difference.
but
i
believe
in
terms
of
voluntariness,
the
only
difference
is
whether
there
is
some
kind
of
a
waiver.
in
ibanez
where
the
lawyer,
who
was
also
an
accountant,
submitted
herself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
accounting
board,
there
was
nothing
requiring
her
to
submit
herself
to
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
unconstitutionally.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
but
i
think
perhaps--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes,
your
honor.
if
the
government
has
a
regulatory
program
providing
an
imprimatur,
certification,
accreditation,
and
you
as
an
individual
or
an
entity,
private
entity,
seek
that
governmental
imprimatur,
it's
available
and
you
seek
that,
then
the
government
must
respect
your
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that
would
be
conduct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that,
again,
the
problem
that
we
have
here
is
that
the
tssaa
has
not--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--between
money
as
an
inducing,
an
inducement,
we
would
view
an
inducement
or
an
incentive
as
conduct,
as
opposed
to
speech,
communication.
here
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
inducement
or
emolument
or
promise
of
future
activity
was
elicited
from
the
school.
the
only
thing
that
was
done
was
sending
them
a
letter
informing
them
about
an
activity
that
was
an
approved
activity.
and
i
think
that
for
our
purposes
in
drafting
and
implementing
the
undue
influence
rule,
the
association
has
never
recognized
the
difference
between
its
authority
to
regulate
speech
and
its
authority
to
regulate
conduct.
and
as
a
result,
they've
never
gone
through
a
process
of
figuring
out
how
can
they
accommodate
their
legitimate
interest.
we...
our
school
strongly
supports
a
recruiting
rule
that's
aimed
at
barring
these
kinds
of
conducts,
chief
justice,
as
you've
just
described.
the
problem
is
that
the
association,
by
not
recognizing
that
the
first
amendment
enters
into
the
analysis,
that
they
have
not...
never
gone
through
a
process
of
calculating
the
cost
on
speech,
as
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
the
lorillard
case
or
the
fox
case
require
that
they
do,
that
they
consider
the
impact
on
speech.
if
you
don't
agree
that
there's
any
difference
between
speech
and
conduct,
you
don't
have
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
a
process.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that's
correct.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
revised
rules
that
the
association
has
adopted
that
does
not
permit
spring
practice...
non-matriculated
students
to
participate
in
spring
practice.
that's
a
regulation
of
conduct
and
it
doesn't
fall
within
speech.
we
think
that
was
the
right
solution,
not
punishing
the
school
in
what--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
under
the
first
amendment,
it
is
a
core
principle
that
speech
about
lawful
or
permitted
conduct
cannot
be
punished
just
because
of
the
speech.
we
have
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
speech
was
actually
beneficial,
it
was
welcomed
by
the
families
and
by
the
children
who
received
the
information.
and
in
fact,
it
was
effective.
the
very
thing
the
tssaa--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--i
believe
that
under
the
lorillard
case
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
fox
case,
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
engage
in
what
is
called
the
careful
calculation
of
cause
and
benefits.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
your
honor,
there
was
in
the
lorillard
case,
the
tobacco
regulation
case,
the
court
was
specifically
critical
that
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
did
not
consider
the
cost
of
speech,
particularly
with
respect
to--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--but
justice
scalia,
in
your
opinion
in
the
fox
case,
one
of
the
safeguards
that
was
articulated
for
speech
protection
was
the
need
to
have
a
procedural
safeguard.
and
one
of
those
safeguards
was
the
development
of
a
careful
calculation
of
benefits
and
costs
with
respect
to
freedom
of
speech.
that
was
the...
that
was
the
case
involving
the
tupperware
parties
on
the
state
university
campus
of
new
york.
and
one
of
the
protections
that
was
built
into
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
in
addition,
there
is
an
obligation
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
thompson
case
for
the
government
to
consider
non-speech
alternatives,
where
to
restrict...
and
to
achieve
its
objectives
by
not
regulating
speech
at
all.
in
the
thompson
case--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
the
district
court
found
that
the
constitutional
balance
tipped
at
that
point
because
the
evidence
suggested
that
while
that
does
happen,
it's
not
a
normal
occurrence,
fewer
than
5
percent
of
cases.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think
that
once
a
family
has...
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
established
that
all
these
families
had
made
their
educational
choice.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
in
this
case,
the
association
allows
the
underlying
practice
itself.
it
permits
the
underlying
practice.
and
so
if
there's
a
concern
about
recruiting--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--but
there's
the
whole
cited
question
3,
justice
souter.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think,
again,
as
long
as
the
association
permits
this
activity
and
says
there
is
a
risk
of
recruiting
at
that
activity
if
the
students
are
not
firmly
committed,
irrevocably
committed
to
a
place,
and
that
they
allow
that
conduct,
then
to
allow
the...
to
bar
the...
the
school
from
talking
about
or
at
least
mentioning
the...
the
activity
as
an
opportunity,
then
at
that
point
the
association
if
it
wants
to
protect
its
interests
must
act
to
prohibit
the
conduct,
not
the
speech.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
because...
ms.
mahoney
cited
an
example
that
does
not
require
initiated
school
contact.
question
3
prohibits
all
contact,
whether
it's
initiated
by
the
school
or
initiated
by
the
student.
in
joint
appendix
181--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes,
we
do.
she
cited
question
3,
and
what
it
says
is,
no
coach...
no.
"a
coach
may
not
contact
a
student
or
his
or
her
parents
prior
to--
"
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
but
not
necessarily
initiated
by
the
coach.
it
would
be,
in
fact,
impermissible.
under
their
interpretation
of
their
own
rules,
it
would
be
impermissible
for
the
coach
to
speak
to
people
at
this
practice.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
once
the
association
determines
that
this
activity
is
legitimate,
and
authorizes
this
with
respect
to
the
feeder
pattern,
so
that
all
public
schools
can
be--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--participating
in
spring
practice.
and
all
the
kind
of
activity
that
the
association
objects
to
would
be
permitted
if
there
were
a
feeder
pattern.
and
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
activity
that
they
say
they
want
to
isolate
the
students
from,
what
you
were
describing
as
coach-initiated
contact,
all
of
that
is
permitted
in
the
feeder
pattern.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
the
proselytization
here
was
found
to
be
a
harmless
letter
sent
just
informing
the
kids
that
they
had
an
opportunity.
so
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
one
characterizes
what
the
communication
is.
we
would
characterize--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--but
the
letter,
justice
scalia,
went
to
all
students,
not
just
the
athletes.
it
was
not
targeted
to
any
particular
person.
all
12
students
who...
male
students
who
were
admitted,
were
incoming
students,
all
of
those
students
got
the
letter.
it
wasn't
targeted
in
any
type
of
recruiting
mode.
every
student
who
was
admitted
and
signed
the
contract
received
the
letter.
and
a
13th
student
who
was
admitted
but
who
did
not
sign
the
enrollment
contract
did
not
receive
the
letter.
so
that
the
school
was
very
careful,
so
that
they--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
these
were
incoming
students,
justice
ginsburg,
and--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--again
we
think
if
the
practice
itself
was
problematic,
was
educationally
unsound,
if
there
was
a
risk
of
any
of
the
interests
that
were
involved,
then
the
association
could
and
did
prohibit
participation
in
that
activity.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
information
that
was
before
the
factfinder
had
to
do
with,
on
the
due
process
point,
had
to
do
with
a
person
who
was
not
related
to
the
school
but
who
had
been,
it
turns
out
falsely,
accused
of
offering
inducements
to
students
to
attend
the
school.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
there
was
a
procedure
in
which
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
the
association
and
the
school,
in
which
the
association
had
some
investigation
and
then
the
school
had
an
opportunity
to
respond.
yes,
judge
kennedy.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
problem
was
that
the
district
court
made
two
findings
in
this
regard
that
were
very
important:
that
the
association
misled
the
school
as
to
what
issues
were
still
open
and
available;
and
that
ultimately
a
matter
involving
this
bart
king
was
discussed
at
the
closed
after-hearing
session,
executive
session,
and
the
school
had
been
told
that
the
bart
king
allegations
were
no
longer
on
the
table.
now,
the
school
did
put
forward
evidence
about
one
youngster
named
jacques
curry
who
was
alleged
to
have
been
recruited
by
bart
king.
again,
bart
king
had
no
status
with
the
school
at
all.
and
they
put
jacques
curry
before
the
hearing
panel
and
the
hearing
panel
wound
up
restoring
his
eligibility.
but
it
turns
out
that
they,
at
the
trial,
that
the
association
members,
or
the
board
of
control,
admitted
that
they
considered
the
bart
king
allegations
to
enhance
the
penalty.
so
it
must
have
been
something
beyond
jacques
curry
and
that
the
school
was
never
informed
that
the
bart
king's
involvement
beyond
jacques
curry
had
anything
to
did
with
the
proceedings.
so
the
district
court
found
there
was
misleading
of
the
school
and
that
they...
the
school
never
had
a
chance
to
respond
to
the
evidence
that
was
presented
by
these
investigators
for
the
association.
and
so
therefore
they
did
not
have
evidence,
they
were
not
aware
of
evidence,
and
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
respond
or
to
reply
to
that
evidence.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
we
don't
know
what
the
evidence
was.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
the
evidence
suggested
that--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--and--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
evidence
was
the
notes
that
was
presented
were
the
notes
taken
by
the
investigators.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
we
hadn't
seen,
we
hadn't
seen
them
before
the
hearing.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
again
i
think
that
what
was...
what
was
available
to
the
association
was...
excuse
me--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
we
did
not
know
that
those
issues
were
even
on
the
table.
the
executive
director
testified
at
trial
that
the
issue
of
bart
king
was
no
longer
on
the
table,
and
the
notes
were
not
presented
to
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
we
learned
that
the
investigators
had
not
spoken
to
mr.
king.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
what
we
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
say,
your
honor,
was
that
we
want
to
understand
what
your
perception,
your,
the
investigators'
perception,
is
of
what
bart
king's
relationship
to
brentwood
academy
is
and
how...
and
what
he
is
alleged
to
have
done.
we
have
no
control,
we
had
no
knowledge,
of
anything
that
mr.
king
did,
and
if
any
of
those
allegations
were
true
the
school
wanted
an
opportunity
to
disassociate
itself.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--i
don't
believe
that
they've
taken
that--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--this
was
mr.
king
himself
was
availability.
and
he...
and
we
put
him
up,
offered
him
for--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--but
the
association,
the
association
association
witnesses
testified
at
trial,
justice
breyer,
that
in
fact
they...
that
they
considered
the
king
allegations.
we
don't
know
exactly
what
that
meant
at
the
trial.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
that
the
board
of
control,
the
tssaa
board.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
and
the
answer
that
was
given
at
trial,
and
the
trial
judge
found
this,
was
that
he
played
a
role,
not
in
the
liable
but
in
the
penalty.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
and
specifically
to
mention
the
terms,
the
length
of
the
probation,
is
what
they
said,
the
probation.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
believe
one
year
has
been
served
at
this
point.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
the
concern
was
that
the
association
had
told
us,
and
the
district
court
found
this,
that
the
king
allegations
were
not
on
the
table.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
but
that
we...
that
the
disclosure
of
evidence
as
a
basis
of
decision
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
evidence
in
a
disciplinary
hearing
this
court
has
held
as
recently
as
the
hamdi
case
and
certainly
in
laudermill
that
that
is
an
important
procedural
protection
of
due
process,
and
that's
what
we're
seeking
in
this
case
as
well,
your--
honor.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
again,
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
framework
that
exists
for
regulatory
cases
fits
this
case
well.
the
only
difference
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
waiver.
we
think
there's
not
a
waiver.
the
government
has
claimed
that
they
can
define
away
first
amendment
rights.
in
our
brief
we
address
that
claim.
we
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
define
away
first
amendment
rights,
and
there
is
not
a
case
that
they
have
cited
really
that
supports
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
should
apply
differently
in
this
context,
where
the
government
is
regulating
just
because
it
is,
the
source
of
authority
is
a
different
source
of
authority,
a
non-sovereign
source
of
authority.
the
southeastern
promotions
case,
the
ibanez
case,
those
cases,
the
barnett
case,
and
the
fox
case,
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
the
fox
case,
make
it
clear
that
the
source
of
authority,
in
that
case
universities,
is
not
determinative.
the
fox
case
discussed
the
elements
of
commercial
speech
and
that
arose
in
a
university
context,
but
it's
been
applied
across
the
board
in
all
commercial
speech
cases,
regulatory
cases,
whether
there
was
sovereign
power
or,
as
in
the
case
of
fox,
it
was
not
sovereign
power
at
all.
so
we
think
that
the
first
amendment
doctrine,
the
rubric
that
we've
described
in
our
brief,
is
the
proper
one
that
should
be
applied
in
this
circumstance
and
that
there's
not
a
need
to
carve
out
a
special
exception,
which
is
what
the
government
is
asking
for
and
what
the
tssaa
is
asking
for,
to
generally
applicable
first
amendment
doctrine.
this
is
a
case
of
content-based
regulation.
the
time,
place,
and
manner
defense
therefore
cannot
work
as
a
defense,
and
we
think
therefore,
the
tssaa
case
collapses
under
first
amendment.
thank
you
very
much.
