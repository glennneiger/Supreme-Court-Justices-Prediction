ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
this
court
adheres
to
its
state
action
ruling,
it
should
now
hold
that
the
tssaa
has
broad
discretion
to
adopt
and
to
enforcement
contractual
restrictions
on
athletic
recruiting
as
a
condition
of
membership.
under
this
court's
cases,
brentwood
cannot
escape
the
contractual
bargain
it's
made
under
the
first
amendment,
because
the
association
offered
it
a
reasonable
choice
as
measured
by
the
three
criteria
that
this
court
has
used
to
identify
unconstitutional
conditions.
first,
participation
in
the
state
tournaments
is
entirely
voluntary.
second,
the
restrictions
at
issue
here
are
germane
to
the
legitimate
goals
of
the
association.
and
third,
enforcement
of
the
rule
here
imposed
only
a
minimal
burden
on
speech
of
private
concerns.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
because
that's
a
core
issue
in
every
case
involving
allegedly
unconstitutional
conditions.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
actually
the
record
indicates
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
give
the
information
about
the
date
for
the
spring
practice
to
the
students
who
had
signed
an
enrollment
contract.
and
that's
at
caja-705.
it
could
have
been
sent
in
an
enrollment
packet,
for
instance.
it
could
have
been
sent
just
as
a
schedule.
but
instead
the
problem
here
was
that
it
was
sent
from
the
coach
in
a
personal
solicitation
to
the
students
that
really
subtly
pressured
them
to
come
to
practice.
this
was
a
form
of
recruiting.
under
question
3,
which
is
the
interpretive
guidance
for
the
recruiting
rule,
it
very
expressly
says
that
coach-initiated
contact
with
students
who
are
enrolled
at
another
school
is
not
supposed
to
occur.
and
so
this
fell
within
the
terms
of
the
rule.
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
it
would
strain
credulity
to
say
that
brentwood
didn't
know
that
it
shouldn't
have
sent
this
letter.
and
their
own
headmaster
acknowledged
that
it
certainly
should
have
been
t
kind
of
thing
that
they
would
have
called
about
before
doing
it,
and
he
was
surprised
that
coach
flatt
had
not
done
so.
so
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
first
point
is
that,
yes,
this
information
could
have
been
communicated
to
the
students,
but
not
in
this
way.
and
certainly
the
association
could
recognize
that
this
was
still
a
form
of
recruiting.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely.
this
was
speech
of
private
concern.
it
was
about
the
time
for
football
practice.
and
there
were
other
ways
that
that
information
could
be
communicated.
but
the
association
has
an
interest
in
having
prophylactic
rules
that
prevent
coaches
from
initiating
communications
with
students
before
they
started
school,
because
even
though
they--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
pickering
is
really
an
example
of
an
unconstitutional
conditions
analysis
just
in
the
employment
context.
what
the
court
really
says
in
a
broad
group
of
cases
where
the
government
or
the
state
actor
is
not
exercising
sovereign
power,
if
it's
offering
a
benefit,
if
it's
using
funding
to
encourage
activity,
if
it
is
engaging
in
a
contractual
relationship
as
it
does
in
umbehr,
that
what
this
court
has
said
in
umbehr
very
explicitly
is
that
when
the
government
uses
contractual
power
the
constitutional
concerns
are
not
as
great.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
and
in
fact
this
court
said
in
umbehr
that,
even
though
the
interests
were
what
different,
the
standards
that
had
been
applied
in
connick
and
pickering
could
easily
accommodate
the
circumstances
of
dealing
with--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
i
think
that
the
key
from
all
the
cases,
whether
we
look
at
cornelius,
which
involves
your
access
to
the
charitable
campaign,
or
if
we
look
at
or
if
we
look
at
lusk
and
american
library,
which
involved
access
to
funding,
or
grove,
access
to
funding,
that
the
strain
across
these
cases
is
that
you're
really
looking
at
is
the
restriction
germane.
what
kind
of
a
burden--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
then
it
would
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
would
probably
be
viewed
as
speech
of
public
concern,
and
at
that
point
under
connick
balancing
you'd
have--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
in
connick
this
court
said
that
in
assessing
whether
something
is
a
issue
of
public
concern
you
look
at
not
just
the
topic,
but
also
the
way
in
which
that
topic
is
discussed.
and
if
what
happened
was
the
association
decided
that
it
was
going
to
penalize
a
member
or
have
a
broad
rule
that
says
it
would
tolerate
no
criticism
and
even
if
brentwood
had
taken
an
ad
out
in
the
paper
to
talk
about
how
terrible
the
association's
policies
were,
i
think
this
court
could
readily
find
that
that
was
not
a
reasonable
choice
because
it
would
impact--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--on
the
field,
your
honor?
i
think
that
the
interests
in
essentially
controlling
that
kind
of
speech
would
always
outweigh
the
interests
of
an
athlete
or
a
coach
in
engaging
in
any
kind
of
speech
on
the
field.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that
would
probably
be
treated
as
speech
of
public
concern,
which
would
then
give
rise
to
connick
balancing.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
what
connick
says
is
you
look
at
how
core
is
the
speech,
what's
it
about?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
probably
find
that
that
not
be
a
reasonable
restriction,
that
it's
probably
not
germane
to
the
important
educational
goals
of
the
association.
but
it
could...
i
mean,
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
recruiting
rule
has
been
applied
to
speech
that's
a
private
concern
that
can
be
delivered
in
another
way;
and
the
choice
to
join
is
entirely
voluntary.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
first,
i
think
that
this
letter,
which
was
not
sent
to
brentwood's
own
eighth
grade
middle
school
students,
probably
could
have
been,
because
under
the
rule
those
students
were
not
enrolled
at
another
school.
and
what
is
really
restricted
is
coach-initiated
contact
with
students
enrolled
at
another
school.
this
letter
was
instead
sent
to
student
whose
were
still
enrolled
at
another
school.
and
the
interest
i
would--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
contracts
weren't
binding.
we
have
the
contracts
in
the
record
at
caja-1889.
but
more
importantly,
whether
it
was
or
not,
the
record
demonstrates
that
some
student
do
sign
multiple
contracts.
some
students
do
not
come.
and
so
efforts
to
get,
of
the
coach,
to
get
them
to
come
to
practice,
to
be
with
him,
to
entice
them,
to
give
them
his
personal
home
phone
number,
that's
still
a
form
of
recruiting.
in
fact,
one
of
the
top
basketball
athletes
in
the
eighth
grade
in
the
city
of
nashville
in
the
1997
was
named
jack
west
curry.
he
signed
one
of
these
contracts.
he
did
not
ultimately
come
to
brentwood.
and
yet
he
was
exactly
the
kind
of
person
that
still
could
have
been
subject
to
recruiting
if
during
that
period--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
certainly
could,
and
so
there's
an
interest
in
stopping
that.
this
court
certainly
has
said
that
even
in
the
commercial
speech
area,
in
ohralik
instance,
that
it's
fineto
have
prophylactic
rules
as
long
as
the
rule
continues
to
advance
the
interest.
the
fact
that
the
interest
may
be
less
strong
at
the
point
when
they
sign
an
enrollment
contract
doesn't
mean
there
is
still
no
legitimate
interest.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
several,
your
honor.
this
is
a
group
of
individuals
involved
in
an
educational
activity
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
they
have
determined
that
athletic
recruiting
is
harmful
to
young
adults,
that
it
puts
too
much
emphasis
on
athletics,
that
it
also--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
in
1997
there
were
five
violations,
five
penalties
for
violations
of
the
recruiting
rule,
and
four
of
them
were
against
public
schools,
one
against
a
private
school.
that's
at
the
transcript
at
2705.
public
schools
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
these
rules
because
they
do
try
to
recruit.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
about
anything?
i
think
again--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
that
is
germane,
and
it
would
also
put
a
very
large
burden
on
speech
if
they
imposed
a
flat
contact.
they've
done
nothing
of
the
kind.
there
have
been--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
they
haven't
done
it.
it
would
certainly
be
far
less
reasonable.
i
don't...
i
think
that
that
would
be
much
more
of
a
burden
on
speech.
here
it's
undisputed...
i
shouldn't
say
it's
undisputed,
but
the
record
certainly
establishes,
that
academic
targeting
is
not
prohibited...
that's
in
the
transcript
at
2202...
that
if
brentwood
academy
or
any
other
school
wants
to
initiate
contact
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
persuade
them
to
come
for
academics,
it's
entirely
free
to
do
so.
this
rule
is
not
designed
to
in
any
way
stifle
those
kinds
of
communications.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
if
i
could
just...
one
thing
i
do
want
to
make
clear
about
the
voluntariness
of
the
choice
and
then
i'll
turn
to
due
process,
is
that,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
one
of
the
things
that
brentwood
and
some
of
its
amici
have
tried
to
say
is
that
there
simply
is
no
ability
to
play
scholastic
sports
in
tennessee
if
you're
not
a
member
of
this
association.
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
for
regular
season
play,
for
instance,
members
of
tssaa
are
free
to
play
any
non-member
schools
they
want.
it
used
to
be
that
the
association
required
approval,
which
was
routinely
granted.
but
in
2005
they
actually
changed
the
rule.
it's
in
the
handbook
at
page
23
on
their
website.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
right,
your
honor.
you
could
have...
all
that
tssaa
does
is
give
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
its
state
tournaments,
post-season
competition.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
christian
athletic
league
that
has
26
private
schools,
that
also
conducts
state
tournaments.
there
are
also
state
tournaments
in
other
sports,
including
lacrosse,
swimming,
that
are
not
run
by
tssaa.
and
there's
nothing
to
stop
brentwood,
for
instance,
from
trying
form
its
own
league,
which
is
what
independent
schools
have
done
in
many
other
states.
they
also
could
have
regular
season
play
with
tssaa
member
schools
and
have
invitationals.
there's
no
bar
on
schools
attending
those.
if
i
could
quickly
turn
to
justice
kennedy's
question
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
due
process.
i
think
that
the
analysis
is
really
quite
similar.
what
occurred
here
is
a
contractual
agreement
to
provide
certain
kinds
of
process
which
actually
satisfy
the
standards
in
laudermill,
but
in
addition
brentwood
would
have
been
able
to
bring
a
beach
of
contract
action
under
state
law
if
it
wanted
to
allege
that
it
didn't
get
the
notice
that
the
contract
required.
and
this
court
held
in
lujan
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
availability
of
a
state
breach
of
contract
action
before
jumping
to
the
conclusion
that
due
process
rights
have
been
violated.
yet
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
take
that
into
account.
if
i
could
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
if
i
could
respond
to
the
due
process
issues,
this
is
still
a
very
important
claim
because
if
in
fact
the
association
has
violated
civil
rights
by
failing
to
give
due
process
brentwood
would
still
be
entitled
to
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.
and
i
think
it's
critical
that
when
an
association
enters
into
a
contract
and
agrees
upon
procedures,
that
if
those
procedures
can...
are
not
followed,
a
member
of
the
association
can
bring
a
breach
of
contract
action
in
state
court.
but
brentwood
did
not
do
that.
instead
it
tried
to
constitutionalize
this
contract
dispute
and
assert
rights
under
section
1983.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
only
state
claim
they
had
as
a
pendant
claim
was
arbitrary
action
under
state
law,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
that
because
it
found
that
the
questions
were
sufficiently
novel
that
he
didn't
feel
that
he
should
entertain
jurisdiction
over
it.
but
they
did
not
assert
a
breach
of
contract
claim.
and
it's
important
to
note
that
the
bylaws
actually
provide
that
a
member
must
be
given,
quote,
"notice
of
the
charges
and
an
opportunity
to
present
its
case
at
a
hearing.
"
so
if
they
actually
did
not
get
notice
of
the
charges
involving
bart
king,
it
would
have
been
a
breach
of
contract.
so
that's
the
first
problem,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
look
at
the
fact
that
they
had
a
contract
remedy,
just
like
the
contractor
had
in
lujan,
and
they
simply
weren't
taking
advantage
of
it.
second,
the
suggestion
that
they
were
not
actually
given
notice
is
contradicted
by
the
record.
and
it's
not
issues
of
credibility.
this
is
just
an
ultimate
conclusion
about
whether
they
had
sufficient
notice.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record,
the
exchange
of
letters,
at
ja-205
is
the
letter
that
starts
by
disclosing
the
charges,
and
it
specifically
discloses
that
the
association
investigators
have
talked
to
a
number
of
middle
school
students,
have
talked
to
a
number
of
middle
school
coaches,
and
details
precisely
what
those
witnesses
have
said
about
bart
king.
now
they
say,
well,
we
didn't
know
that
bart
king
was
still
involved
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
last
hearing.
but
look
in
fact
what
they
did.
they
came
to
the
hearing.
they
submitted
the
affidavit
of
bart
king.
one
of
their
live
witnesses
was
jacques
curry
and
the
only
thing
he
testified
about
was
his
relationship
with
bart
king.
and
then
they
ran
out
of
time.
they
ran
out
of
time.
they
had
bart
king
there.
they
were
thinking
about
putting
him
on
live.
they
had
had
an
allotted
period
of
time.
they
used
it
all
up
without
putting--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
they've
said
that
they
didn't
know
about.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
most
of
them
actually
testified
that
they
did
not.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
there
was
one
who
had
testified--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--he
did,
your
honor,
and...
but
even
if
that's
true,
even
if
the
board
did
rely
on
evidence
about
bart
king
in
deciding
what
penalty
ought
to
be,
how
much
probation,
whatever,
that
still
does
not
establish
that
there
was
a
due
process
violation
because
they
had
notice
that
the
bart
king
issues
could
be
considered
at
this
trial.
they
actually
submitted
evidence.
they
submitted
bart
king's
affidavit
and
the
record
shows
that
the
board
said
they
considered
all
the
evidence
that
had
been
submitted.
and
when
they...
and
the
reason
they
didn't
put
him
on,
they
say:
"it
was
our
intention
to
put
him
on,
but
i
don't
know
if
you
are
all
interested
in
extending
for
five
minutes
to
hear
from
bart
king
or
not.
"
"he's
here
if
you
want
him.
"
carter
responds
"no".
he
doesn't
say:
the
king
issues
aren't
on
the
table.
thank
you,
your
honor.
