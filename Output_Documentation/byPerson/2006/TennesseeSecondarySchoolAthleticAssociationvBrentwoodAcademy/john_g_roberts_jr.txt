chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
06-427,
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association
versus
brentwood
academy.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
if,
what
if
the
association
had
a
rule
that
members,
school
officials,
shall
not
criticize
the
decisions
of
the
association?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
germane.
in
other
words,
you
can
criticize
other
things,
but
if
you're
going
to
join
this
group
we
think
it's
important
for
their
public
stature
not
to
be
criticized
by
members.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
more
public
concern
about
when
spring
practice
is.
if
you
think
there
should
be,
you
know,
two
playoff
tiers
rather
than
three
and
you
criticize
the
association
for
that
and
they
say
well,
you're
suspended
for
a
year
and
all
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
criticizing
officials?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
mean
three
days
later,
you
know,
the
school...
the
coach
writes
an
editorial
saying
there
were
lousy
calls
in
the
game
last
week.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
is
the
interest
behind
the
anti-recruiting
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
could
have
determined
that
it's
particularly
harmful
to
the
public
schools
who
don't
have
the
option
of
recruiting
while
the
private
schools
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
other?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
himmelfarb?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
you
think
it
might
be
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
close
call
whether
a
school
can
send
a
brochure
to
8th
graders
that
is
not
limited
to
athletics
telling
them
about
their
school?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
mailing
was
limited
to
people
who
had
signed
contracts
with...
students,
not
just
football
players
but
everyone
who
else
had
signed
enrollment
contracts
with
the
school?
general
brochure
listing
all
the
things
you
can
do
at
the
school
including
athletics,
including...
you
know,
other
extracurricular
activities?
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
would
it
be
unreasonable
for
the
tssaa
to
prohibit
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
blumstein?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
you
decided
to
offer
bonuses
to
8th
graders,
a
thousand
dollars...
and
of
course
that's,
i
assume
that's
against
the
rules
in
tennessee...
would
you
have...
would
that
be
covered
by
your
first
amendment
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
line
that
we
draw
elsewhere
in
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we're
not
going
to
extend
for
five
minutes.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-427,
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association
versus
brentwood
academy.
