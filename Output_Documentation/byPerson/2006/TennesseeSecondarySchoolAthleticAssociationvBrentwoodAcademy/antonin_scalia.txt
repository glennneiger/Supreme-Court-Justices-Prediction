justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
claim
here
is
not
that
they
didn't
apply
the
rules
fairly,
your
claim
is--
that
they
applied
the
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
fairly.
fairly
as
they
were
written.
but
you
say
even
if
they
did
apply
them
fairly,
that's
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
beneficial
to
the
system.
that's
why
the
organization
didn't
like
it.
and
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
something
you
said
just
a
minute
ago,
that
there's
an
obligation
under
the
first
amendment
to
weigh
the
effects
of
speech.
is
there?
i
mean,
suppose
a
government
organization
simply
comes
out
with
a
rule
that
is
perfectly
fair,
and
that
happens
to
give
due
weight
to
the
fact
that
it's
restricting
speech,
but
the
government
organization
has
frankly
never
considered
it.
they
didn't
sit
down
around
a
table
and
say
now,
look,
this
is
going
affect
speech,
let's
be
careful
here.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
just
promulgated
a
perfectly
reasonable
rule.
wouldn't
we
uphold
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
consider
the
matter,
do
they?
they
just
have
to
get
it
right,
whether
they
considered
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly.
we
have
to
do
that.
certainly
we
have
to
do
it
in
assessing
whether,
what
the
government
has
done
is
okay.
but
you're
saying
it's
invalid
unless
the
government
gathers
together
a
group
of
people
just
to
shoot
the
breeze
about...
i
don't
know
of
any
of
our
cases
that
require
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
may
criticize
them
when
they
get
it...
when
it
comes
out
wrong.
then
you
can
say,
when
the
result
is
wrong,
they
should
have
considered
it.
but
when
it
comes
out
right?
do
you
have
any
case
where
it
comes
out
right
and
it's
perfectly
reasonable,
we
say
tsk,
tsk,
oh,
but
even
though
it
came
out
right,
they
didn't
consider
speech?
we've
never
said
anything
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
where
you
had
an
approval
system
where
one
party
would
be
approved
and
another
one
wouldn't.
of
course,
in
that
situation,
you
have
to
engage
case
by
case
in
making
the
weighing.
but
this
is
not
an
approval
situation.
it's
the
issuance
of
a
rule
that
applies
to
everybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
letter
from
coach.
i
mean,
that
to
a
young
kid,
that
is
recruiting.
that
is
showing
an
interest
on
the
part
of
the
person
who's
going
to
decide
who
plays,
an
interest
in
you.
i
think
it's
entirely
reasonable
to
consider
that
recruiting.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
it
say,
by
the
way,
everybody
got
this
letter?
did
it
say
that
at
the
bottom?
