what
was
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
at
this
late
date,
you've
had
trials.
you're
saying...
did
you
ask?
with
all
these
people
under
oath,
haven't
you
had
trials
and
everything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
ever
ask
the
people
who
were
at
the
meeting,
what
was
the
evidence
you
considered
that
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to
see?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
and
what
did
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
there
were
some
notes
taken
by
investigators,
which
did
they
have
anything
new
in
them
you
hadn't
seen
before?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
in
there
that
you
had
not
seen
before
in
the
notes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you:
what
was
in
the
notes
that
were
presented
to
the
decisionmaker
that
you
had
not
previously
seen
and
therefore
had
no
opportunity
to
rebut?
what
particularly
and
specifically?
and
it's
surprising
to
me
that
you
hesitate
at
this
very
late
date
if
this
is
a
serious
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
it
say
in
the
notes
that
you,
a
factual
matter
or
some
other,
that
you
did
not
have
a
chance
to
reply
to
specifically?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
learned
was
the
investigators
had
not
spoken
to
mr.
king,
and
you
previously
did
not
know
that,
and
if
you
had
known
that
you
would
have
said
to
the
decisionmaker:
the
investigators
did
not
speak
to
mr.
king.
and
if
you
had
said
that,
how
would
this
case
be
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other
side
says,
mr.
bart
king
was
part
of
the
school
and
had
something
to
do
with
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
i
don't
understand
what
the
relevance
of
this
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
understand
what
mr.
king
has
to
do
with
this
if
the
other
side
is
not
claiming
that
mr.
king
is
part
of
your
operation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
considered
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
ask
the
people
on
the
board
of
control,
what
role
did
mr.
king
play
in
your
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
they
might
have
reduced
it
ed
it
from
$3,000
to
less
had
they
not
been
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
mr.
king
had
something
to
do
with
you
when
he
did
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
probation
was...
and
the
probation,
which
was
for
four
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
have
you
served
the
four
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
three
more
years?
so
if
in
fact
you
are
correct
that
they
were
under
a
misapprehension
on
this
matter,
then
the
thing
to
do
would
to
be
find
out
if
that
extra
three
years
had
something
to
do
with
this
erroneous
thing
of
mr.
king?
it's
surprising
to
me
all
of
this
is
coming
up
now,
but
there
we
are.
so
but
that's
your
specific
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
a
different
claim.
i
thought
you
were
claiming
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
because
an
investigator
spoke
without
you
present
to
the
board.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
i
would
think
was
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution
since
it
happens
every
day
of
the
week
in
administrative
agencies.
but
if
you
want
to
claim
it
is,
i'll
be
happy
to
listen.
and
i
think
in
that
you're
saying
the
administrative
procedures
act
is
unconstitutional,
which
would
be
a
surprising
claim
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anything
at
the
trial
that
came
out
that
the
investigator
when
they
were
in
the
private
session
said
a
fact
about
bart
king
of
supreme
importance
that
they
didn't
know
about?
