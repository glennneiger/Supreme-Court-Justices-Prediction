so
in
speech
terms,
there
were
alternative
means
to
get
the
message
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
briefs
are...
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
the
respondent's
brief
this
way,
or
fair
to
concentrate
on
pickering.
it
seems
to
me
that
pickering
is
the
key
here,
and
i
took
away
that
impression
from
your
brief.
if
we
said
that
it's
commercial
speech,
i
think
that's
a
little
far
off
the
mark.
if
we
said
it's
an
unconstitutional
condition,
i'm
not
sure
that
helps
either
side
that
much,
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
umbehr
we
said,
the
court
said,
that
in
the
independent
contractor
cases
the
interests
of
either
party,
the
government
or
the
contractor,
are
not
quite
so
intense
as
they
are
with
a
public
employee.
i
thought
that
made
sense
when
i
read
it.
i'm
not
so
sure
it
does
any
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
we
could
construct
a
hypothetical
where
we
could
say
there's
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
contractor.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that
works
as
a
general
theorem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
would
you
balance
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
would
you
commence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
association
bar
brentwood
from
contacting
public
school
students
altogether?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
about
enrollment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
like
if
brentwood,
let's
assume...
i
think
it's
true...
is
rather
well-known
in
the
state,
and
if
they
send
you
a
solicitation
form
to
enroll,
everybody
knows
they've
got
a
great
athletic
program,
so
we
say
you
can't
solicit
any
high
school
students.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
haven't
kept
track
of
your
time,
but
if
we're
going
to
rule
for
you
we
have
to
reach
the
due
process
problem.
and
at
some
point
after
you
finish
discussing
what
you
wish
to
on
free
speech,
i
actually
find
that
a
somewhat
more
difficult
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that,
turning
to
the
state
action
for
a
moment,
one
of
the
justifications
for
finding
state
action
that
is
there
is
no
other
real
choice,
that
they
have,
other
than
to...
if
they
want
to
play
athletics
in
tennessee
other
than
to
join
this
association.
and
yet
at
the
opening
of
your
argument,
you
said
oh,
well
it's
voluntary.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
speech
argument
is
inconsistent
with
one
of
the
justifications
for
finding
state
action
to
begin
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
somewhat
inconsistent
with
one
of
the
most
forceful
arguments
for
finding
state
action
to
begin
it,
i.e.,
that
you
have
to
join
the
school
if
you
really
want
to
compete
with
most
of
the
schools.
you
have
to
join
the
association.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
serve
the
suspension
or
has
that
been
stayed?
was
it
suspended
from
competition
for
two
years?
that
was
the
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it...
did
that
take
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
year--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--weren't
all
these
things
that
are
being
discussed
before
the
factfinder,
or
was
there
some
ex
parte
contact
later
which
was
the
only
evidence
for
what
we're
talking
about
now?
i'm
getting
into
the
due
process
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
mean,
all
of
these
matters
were
discussed
and
there
was
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
all
of
these
matters
that
we've
just
been
talking
about,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
there's
a
strong
case
for
a
flawed
hearing
for
a
due
process
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
it
had
some
state
claims
as
pendant
claims.
