justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that...
i
mean,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
that
the
cause
of
action
would
have
accrued
at
the
moment
at
which
he
was
bound
over
by
the
decision
of
an
independent
magistrate.
at
that
point
the
false
arrest
and
the
incarceration
incident
to
the
false
arrest
is
over
and
if
there
is
ever
going
to
be
a
claim
for
what
happens
next,
i
gather
it'ss
going
to
be
a
common
law
action
for
false
imprisonment,
and
that,
i
guess,
would
not
accrue
until
the
imprisonment
is
over.
but
so
far
as
the
arrest
is
concerned,
whatever
whatever
wrong
is
done,
that
wrong
is
completed
at
the
point
at
which
an
independent
magistrate
takes
over.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
of
that
occurred,
as
i...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
facts,
but
i
thought
all
of
that
occurred
prior
to...
i
don't
know
what
they
call
it
in
illinois,
but
prior
to
a
bind-over
hearing
or
prior
to
the
point
at
which
the
judiciary
steps
in,
breaking
the,
as
it
were,
the
chain
of
causation
between
what
the
police
do
and
the
subsequent
incarceration.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
just
as
a
factual
matter
is
it
correct...
is
it
correct
as
a
factual
matter
that
the
confession
that
was
given
was
a
confession
that
was
given
before
there
was
any
judicial
intervention,
before
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
be
a
mess?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court,
once
it
is
filed...
something
is
filed
within
the
two
year
statute,
the
district
court
can
tell
virtually
immediately
whether
there
are
criminal
proceedings
that
are
yet
to
be
held,
and
the
district
court
can
simply,
it
can
simply
stay
further
proceedings
until
those
criminal
proceedings
are
over.
if
there's
a
possibility
of
collateral
attacks,
the
district
court
can
simply
say
hey,
are
you
going
to
file
a
collateral
attack?
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
stay
it
further.
if
the
answer
is
no,
go
ahead
with
it
then.
what's
tough
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
premise
of
my
question.
but
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
to
be
fairly
easily
administered.
justice
david
h.
souter
20,000
might
make
me
shudder.
but
we
got
one.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
explain
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
don't
you
think
that
a
civil
action
which
necessarily
has
to
be
stayed,
might
be
a
basis
for,
for
the
court
in
the
criminal
case
to
limit
that
kind
of
cross-examination?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
there
appeals
from
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
don't
you...
don't
you
think
ultimately
you
could
get
that
issue
resolved?
justice
david
h.
souter
come...
come
back
here.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
even
on
the
basis
of
innocence?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
common
law
would
give
damages
in
a
case
like
this
in
which
the
release
was
basically
governed
by
a
suppression
which
has
nothing
to
do
one
way
or
the
other
with
the
innocence
of
that
person?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
fifth
amendment
claim
were
before
us,
do
i
understand
you
to
have
said
before
that
the
fourth
amendment
claim
of
false
arrest
would
also
be
subject
to
litigation
as
part
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim
or
under
the
umbrella
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
so
that
the
statute
would
not
have
run
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
had
also
brought
a
fifth
amendment
claim,
your
view
as
i
take
it
would
be
as
follows:
number
one,
his
fourth
amendment
claim,
the
running
of
the
statute,
the
fourth
amendment
claim
would
be
unaffected
by
that,
so
that
would
have
to
have
been
brought
within
the
two-year
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
two,
i'm
assuming,
and
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
my
assumption
is
right...
i
am
assuming
that
if
a
fifth
amendment
claim
were
brought
by...
no,
strike
the
assumption.
you,
i
take
it,
would...
let
me
ask
a
different
question.
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
so
long
as
a
criminal
case
was
pending,
that
it
would
be
sensible
and
maybe
required
for
the
court
simply
to
abstain
from
any
proceedings
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
agree
that
the
court,
if
there's
a
criminal
case
going
on,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
the
court
should
not
proceed
to
trial
in
the
1983
action.
