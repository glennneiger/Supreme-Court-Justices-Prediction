justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
mr.
flaxman,
is
your
argument
limited
to
that
situation,
where
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
against
the
criminal
defendant
other
than
the
illegally
seized
evidence?
or
would
it
apply
in
some
situations
in
which
there
is
some
additional
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
any
additional
evidence,
even
if
it
would
be
insufficient
to
support
a
conviction,
takes...
makes
make
this...
would
make
this
a
different
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what,
what
does
necessarily
mean?
does
it
mean
no
additional
evidence?
does
it
mean
no
additional
evidence
that
is
insufficient
to
support
a
conviction?
does
it
mean
no
additional
evidence
that
would
be
likely
to
persuade
a
trier
of
fact?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
let
me
just
me
more
question
on
it.
in
this
case,
suppose
there
had
been
a
witness
who
said
at
about
the
time
when
this
murder
took
place,
i
saw
somebody
who
was
between,
i
would
judge
as
between
the
age
of
15
and
25,
average
height,
average
build,
running
away.
and
let's
say
that
your
client
fits
that
description.
now
would
that
be
enough
to
take
this
case
out
of
the
rule
that
you're
arguing
for?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
well...
until
the
trial--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
does
somebody
like
mr.
wallace
do
under
your
rule
if
he's
in
a
jurisdiction
where
there's
not
a
lot
of
discovery
in
criminal
cases.
he
isn't
going
to
know
until
trial
whether
his
cause
of
action
accrued
sometime
earlier
or
whether
it
waited.
