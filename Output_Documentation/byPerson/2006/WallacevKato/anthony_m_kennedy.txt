justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but
you
presume
in
your
last
answer
that
other
than
that,
there
is
an
absolutely
fair
prosecution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
why
do
we
make
that
assumption
when
we
start
out
with
the
allegation
of
a
tort
and
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
fact...
suppose
that
there
were
even
a
more
serious
battery
here,
a
broken
limb
or
something.
would
you
have
to
sue
for
the
damages
for
the
battery
right
away?
the
police
officers
injured--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
what
about
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still,
i'm
still
puzzled
about
my
question.
suppose
there's
a
battery
resulting
in
a
serious
injury
to
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
other
evidence
and
so
forth.
can
you
sue
for
the
battery
at
once?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that
the
situation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
or
is
it
just
because
of
the
assumption
that
the
conviction
might
stand
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
does,
then
you
wait?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
many
cases
in
which
the
rule
of
stone
versus
powell
is
inapplicable
for
that
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
beating
of
the
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
my
question
is
going
to
be
along
the
same
lines.
suppose...
i
assume
this
is
a
rather
frequent
case...
the
confession
is
alleged
to
be
the
product
of
a
beating.
the
two
are
merged.
if
we
have
to
wait
for
the
fifth
amendment
claim
anyway,
then
as
a
matter
of
policy,
matter
of
convenience,
why
don't
we
wait
for
the
fourth
amendment
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
making
up
the
rule
of
accrual,
ms.
solomon.
i'm
asking,
if
we
have
to
wait
for
one,
why
not
wait
for
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
when
the
district
court
wants
to
determine
if
he
should
hold
something
in
abeyance,
this
is
not
necessarily
abstention;
this
is
what
courts
always
do
when
there
are
multiple
actions.
other
action
pending
is
a
general
ground
for
a
court
to
stay
its
hand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
missed
mr.
flaxman's
point
that
this
would
an
advantage
to
the
prosecutor
to
say,
aren't
you
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money
about
this
case?
my
initial
reaction
as
the
defense
counsel,
i
would
love
that
comment.
i
would
tell
the
jury:
of
course,
it's
our
duty
as
counsel
to
point
out
that
my
client
was
beaten,
he
was
terrified,
he
was
beaten
again,
he
had
a
false
confession,
and
the
damages
we're
not
interested
in;
we'll
get
much
more
damages
if
you
convict
and
we
show
this
15
years
later
because
the
policemen
lied
as
they
always
do.
you
know,
you
hear
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
has
tried
more
of
these
cases
than
i
have
and
he
indicates
this
is
a
serious
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
this
is
the
cook
county.
this
is
the
cook
county
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
he
says
the
fact
of
the
complaint
the
prosecutor's
going
to
use
in
order
to
show
that
they're
trying
to
profit
from
a
false
claim
of
a
beating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
point
is
if
the
complaint
is
filed
then
the
prosecution
can
makes
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
ever
be
proper
for
a
district
court
to
insist
on
proceeding
to
the
merits
of
the
claim,
to
dispose
of
the
merits
of
the
claim,
while
the
prosecution
was
pending?
suppose
the
district
court
thought
that
it
was
seeing
too
many
of
these
claims
and
it
wanted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
haven't
written
about
that
other
than
in
heck
explicitly
and
implicitly,
and
in
younger?
that's
about
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
in
effect
is
saying
we
can't
have
a
statute
of
limitations
rule;
we're
just
going
to
laches,
we're
just
going
to
an
equitable
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
just
throwing
up
our
hands
and
saying
there
is
statute
of
limitations
statute
of
limitations.
