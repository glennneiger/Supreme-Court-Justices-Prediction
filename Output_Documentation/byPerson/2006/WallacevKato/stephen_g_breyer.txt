justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens...
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
the
problem
is
for
you.
on
january
1,
your
client's
arrested
unlawfully.
now
suppose
the
rule
was
you
have
two
years
to
file
it,
starting
now.
what
is
the
problem
for
you?
the
problem
is
maybe
in
a
year,
or
maybe
less,
the
police
start
to
prosecute
him.
in
the
meantime,
your
trial
is
going
forward
because
you
filed
it
on
time.
so
when
they
start
to
prosecute
him,
you
don't
yet
know
what's
going
to
happen.
and
it
could
happen
that
he's
convicted
and
you
think
it's
illegal
because
of
the
arrest
and
necessarily
so.
and
therefore
you
have
to
stop
the
trial,
i
guess,
because
of
heck.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
work,
i
guess.
they'd
stop
it
and
then
they'd
have
to
bring
it...
you'd
have
to
stop
it
and
then
you'd
have
to
go
through
these
other
remedies
and
they
you'd
have
to
go
back
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
would
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
mess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
modify
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
is
complicated.
i
want
to
suggest
a
modification
with
this
suit
here.
you
say
you
have
to
file
within
two
years.
but
wait,
you
have...
we
tolled
the
statute.
if
the
person
is
arrested
and
charged,
and
convicted,
for
all
the
time
that
is
going
on,
it
is
just
tolled,
equitably.
and
after
the
conviction,
if
he's
acquitted,
by
the
way,
or
he
isn't
arrested,
the
statute
starts
to
run
again.
now
if
he's
convicted,
as
long
as
you
have
filed,
proceeding
to
challenge
the
conviction,
it
is
tolled.
now,
would
that...
that
it
seems
to
me
would
help
every
problem
you
have,
and
it
would
be
called
equitable
tolling.
and
that's
been
suggested
by
judges
in
different
forums
and
many
states
have
it.
and
what's
the
problem?
that
just
solves
the
problem,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
well,
we
could
do
it
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
cases
require
overruling?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
seems
to
me
identical
to
the
rule
you
are
advocating
but
with
one
difference.
the
difference
with
the
rule
you
are
advocating
is
a
judge
who
is
going
to
be
judge
at
time
a
with
your
first
case,
is
going
to
have
to
guess
whether
it
is
in
this
case
or
not
in
this
case
necessarily
related
to
some
kind
of
challenge
to
conviction
you're
going
to
bring
later
if
you
happen
to
get
convicted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
way
to
guess
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
anything
that
you
are
aware
of
that
it
would
be
contrary
to?
i
know
there
are
cases
that
say
you
look
to
states
but
you
only
look
to
states
where
the
state
law
is,
in
fact,
consistent
with
the
federal
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
problem
is
solved
too
if
you
simply
say
bring
it,
day
one,
you
are
arrested,
and
if
in
fact
before
the
statute
of
limitations
expires,
your
client
is
brought
to
the
court
and
is
going
to
be
prosecuted.
tolled.
they
don't
need
two
actions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
position
with
regard
to
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
where
the
defendant
is
arrested
and
excessive
force
is
used
by
the
police,
they
beat
him
up
or
something
like
that.
when
does
that
cause
of
action
accrue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
problem.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
easy.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
your
point
of
view,
now,
on
january
1,
some,
let's
call
it
an
unconstitutional
action
allegedly.
so,
i
don't
want
to
distinguish
for
the
moment
between
fourth
and
fifth.
on
january
1
the
event
occurs.
then
you
say
you
have
two
years
to
file
your
claim
in
the
federal
court
of
a
violation
of
1983,
for
example.
then
that
happens.
let's
say
two
months
later
they
file
it.
the
defendant
files
it.
a
month
after
that,
there
is
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
now,
you're
the
federal
judge.
what's
supposed
to
happen?
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
judge
sitting
there,
under
your
theory,
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
decision.
he's
going
to
have
to
say
now,
is
the
kind
of
claim
that's
being
argued
in
my
court
that
the
policemen
did
something
unconstitutional,
if
i
say
that's
correct,
that
the
plaintiff
wins,
i
have
to
go
on
to
say
does
the
correctness
of
that,
there
was
a
violation,
mean
that
the
conviction
if
there
is
a
conviction
in
the
state
court
later,
will
necessarily
be
vitiated.
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
he
shouldn't
go
ahead;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct,
we're
getting
to
exactly
the
same
problem,
whether
we
do
it
through
a
set
of
abstention
rules,
which
we
have
to
have
federal
abstention
rules
or
it
won't
be
worked
out
properly,
or
we
have
to
have
federal
tolling
rules.
i
don't
see
any
way
to
get
to
a
sensible
result
here
without
either
having
clear
abstention
rules,
just
as
you
say,
having
clear
tolling
rules,
as
i
suggested
before.
am
i
right?
if
i'm
wrong,
let
me
know
why;
and
if
i'm
right,
which
do
you
prefer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
do
it
with
a
stay,
i
mean,
i
see
that
disadvantage.
if
you
do
it
with
a
stay,
the
federal
judge
is
going
to
have
to
sit
there
with
the
papers
in
front
of
him,
look
at
that
evidence,
think
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
trial
at
the
criminal
case
which
i'm
not
quite
certain
yet,
and
then
make
a
determination.
it
sounds
like
a
very
difficult
decision
and
it
sounds
like
sometimes
they'll
get
it
wrong,
sometimes
they'll
get
it
right.
the
defendant
might
be
arguing
two
different
things,
you
know,
one
in
the
state
court
to
try
to
get
them
to
go
ahead,
and
the
other
to
try
to
get
them
to
go
ahead
in
the
federal
court.
what
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
delay
accrual
by
tolling,
you
do
have
the
disadvantage
that
in
some
instances
the
policemen
won't
know
for
quite
a
while
whether
the
case
is
being
brought.
that's
true;
and
in
the
other
instance,
he
won't
know
for
quite
a
while
how
the
case
is
going
to
come
out,
which
may
be
worse.
but
you
don't
have
any
uncertainty.
you
have
no
uncertainty.
you
would
know
once
the
man
is
released.
it's
no
tolling.
once
he's
convicted,
it's
tolled.
then
the
conviction
comes
in.
not
tolled
until
they
bring
a
proceeding.
