but
only
if,
only
if
the
challenged
evidence,
the
challenge
to
the
evidence,
if
sustained,
would
necessarily...
and
this
is
the
crucial
language...
invalidate
the
criminal
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
necessarily
have?
you
could
have
said
that
ex
ante?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
what
other
evidence
there
might
have
been
in
the
criminal
case.
ex
ante
you
can't
tell.
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
you
didn't,
you
didn't
know
that
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made,
or
at
the
time
the
confession
was
extorted,
or
at
the
time
he
was
bound
over.
you
really
didn't
know
that
until
the
trial.
for
all
you
knew,
they
might
have
found
in
addition
to
the
confession,
they
might
have
found
eyewitnesss
who
would
have
identified
your
client.
you
couldn't
tell
that
until
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
the
trial,
until
the
process
of
trial
began.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
conviction
in
heck
existed
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
tort.
and
what
heck
said
is
where
you
have
an
outstanding
conviction,
and
you
have
a
constitutional
tort,
you
can't
sue
on
that
constitutional...
and
where...
you
cannot
sue
on
that
constitutional
tort
if
the
decision
on
the
tort
would
effectively
contradict
your
conviction.
until
the
conviction
has
been
set
aside.
well,
this
is
not
that
situation.
there
was
no
outstanding
conviction
involved.
so
why
did
you
have
to
wait?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
he
have
to
sue
on
the
first
one
right
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
flaxman,
before
you
save
your
time,
i
didn't
understand
why
you're
content
with
justice
breyer's
tolling
situation,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
way
he
put
it
is,
so
long
as
the...
as
the
criminal
case
is
commenced
within
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations,
how
does
that
help
you
when
the
statute
of
limitations
has
passed?
then
there's
no
tolling.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
two
years
doesn't
seem
to
be
unheard
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
willing
to
let
those
people
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
the
only
defendants
you
are
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is
the
defendant
in
a
fifth
amendment
claim?
is
it
the
policemen
who
extracted
the
confession
or
is
it
the
prosecutor
who
introduced
it
at
trial,
since
that
is
the
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
on
january
17,
1994
john
handy
was
shot
and
killed
in
the
city
of
chicago.
two
days
later
chicago
police
officers,
the
respondents
here,
arrested
petitioner
who
was
then
15
years
of
age.
after
several
hours
of
interrogation
petitioner
confess
to
the
murder.
he
was
tried
and
convicted
but
in
2001
a
state
court
vacated
his
conviction
after
concluding
that
his
confession
was
inadmissible
as
the
product
of
an
arrest
that
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
state
did
not
thereafter
retry
petitioner
and
instead
dropped
the
charges
in
april
of
2002.
in
april
of
2003,
petitioner
filed
this
civil
rights
suit
under
42
u.s.c.
§
1983
seeking
damages
arising
from
his
unlawful
arrest
which
had
taken
placed
nearly
ten
years
earlier.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
respondents,
the
police
officers
who
had
made
the
arrest
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
according
to
the
seventh
circuit
petitioner’s
1983
suit
was
time-barred
because
of
the
clock
on
his
statute
of
limitations
began
to
run
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
not
many
years
later
when
his
conviction
was
eventually
set
aside.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirmed.
section
1983
is
a
federal
clause
of
action.
but
it
occasionally
borrows
from
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
cause
of
action
arose.
that
is
so
for
the
length
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
we
have
held
is
the
limitations
period
that
the
state
provides
for
personal
injury
suits,
here
under
illinois
law
two
years.
the
accrual
date
of
1983
clause
of
action
that
is
when
the
clock
begins
to
run
is
a
question
of
federal
law
resolved
not
by
reference
to
state
law
but
by
federal
rules
conforming
in
general
to
common
law
toward
principles.
under
those
principles
a
claim
accrues
when
the
plaintiff
has
a
complete
and
present
clause
of
action
entitling
him
to
file
suit
and
obtain
relief.
in
this
case
petitioner
suffered
an
injury
immediately
upon
his
unlawful
arrest
and
could
have
filed
suit
at
that
time.
the
statute
of
limitations
would
thus
normally
commence
to
run
from
that
day.
but
we
have
to
refine
this
analysis
because
of
a
common
law’s
distinctive
treatment
of
it
towards
a
false
imprisonment
and
its
subspecies
false
arrest.
the
causes
of
action
that
provide
the
closest
analogy
to
claims
of
the
type
considered
here.
false
imprisonment
is
the
proper
analogy
because
it
remedies
detention
without
legal
process
and
the
allegations
before
us
arise
from
respondent’s
detention
of
petitioner
without
warrant
in
january
of
1994.
they
didn’t
have
a
warrant
or
any
other
valid
cause
according
to
the
decisions
below
to
detain
him.
under
common
law
the
running
of
the
statue
limitations
on
false
imprisonment
is
subject
to
a
distinctive
rule.
the
limitation
begins
to
run
against
an
action
for
false
imprisonment
when
the
alleged
false
imprisonment
ends.
the
reason
for
that
role
is
obvious
you
can
hardly
file
a
suit
while
you’re
still
being
imprisoned.
when
then
did
petitioner’s
false
imprisonment
end?
reflecting
the
fact
that
false
imprisonment
consists
of
detention
without
legal
process.
a
false
imprisonment
ends
once
the
victim
becomes
held
pursuant
to
such
process,
when
for
example
he
is
bound
over
by
a
magistrate
or
arraigned
on
charges.
thus
petitioner’s
false
imprisonment
did
not
end
when
as
he
says
the
state
dropped
its
charges
but
rather
when
petitioner
appeared
before
the
examining
magistrate
and
was
bound
over
for
trial.
since
more
than
two
years
elapsed
between
that
date
and
the
filing
of
this
suit
even
leaving
out
of
the
count
the
period
when
petitioner
was
still
a
minor
his
action
was
time-barred.
we
reject
petitioner’s
contention
that
our
decision
in
heck
versus
humphrey
compels
the
conclusion
that
his
suit
could
not
accrue
until
the
state
dropped
its
charges
against
him.
in
heck
we
held
that
“in
order
to
recover
damages
for
allegedly
unconstitutional
conviction
or
imprisonment
or
for
other
harm
caused
by
actions
whose
unlawfulness
would
render
a
conviction
or
sentence
invalid
in
the
case
here.
a
section
1983
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
conviction
or
sentence
has
been
set
aside.
a
claim
for
damages
bearing
that
relationship
to
a
conviction
that
has
not
been
so
invalidated
is
not
cognizable
under
section
1983”.
heck’s
deferred
accrual
rule
is
called
into
play
however
only
when
there
exists
an
outstanding
criminal
judgment.
it
cannot
apply
here
because
when
petitioner
was
arrested
and
then
detained
pursuant
to
legal
process
there
was
an
existence
no
criminal
conviction
that
a
1983
suit
could
impute.
petitioner
seeks
the
adoption
of
a
principle
going
well
beyond
heck
mainly
that
an
action
which
would
impugn
an
anticipated
future
conviction
cannot
be
brought
until
that
conviction
occurs
and
is
set
aside.
the
impracticality
of
such
a
rule
is
obvious
as
it
would
require
a
speculation
into
whether
a
prosecution
will
be
brought
what
evidence
will
be
introduced
and
whether
a
conviction
would
result.
the
fact
that
1983
action
sometimes
accrue
before
the
setting
aside
of
indeed
even
before
the
existence
of
the
related
criminal
conviction
raises
some
question
whether
assuming
the
heck
bar
takes
effect
when
the
later
conviction
is
obtained
the
statue
of
limitations
on
the
once
valid
clause
of
action
is
told
is
suspended
as
long
as
the
heck
bar
subsists.
section
1983
generally
borrows
state
tolling
rules
and
we
are
aware
of
no
illinois
cases
providing
for
tolling
in
even
remotely
comparable
circumstances
nor
are
we
inclined
to
adopt
a
federal
tolling
rule
to
this
effect.
such
a
rule
would
create
a
jurisprudential
limbo
in
which
it
would
not
be
known
whether
tolling
is
appropriate
by
reason
of
the
heck
bar
until
it
is
established
that
the
newly
entered
conviction
would
be
impugned
by
the
not
yet
filed
and
utterly
indeterminate
it
section
1983
suit.
such
a
tolling
rule
would
fail
to
provide
law
enforcement
officers
adequate
notice
to
preserve
beyond
the
normal
limitations
period
evidence
that
will
be
needed
for
their
defense.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
