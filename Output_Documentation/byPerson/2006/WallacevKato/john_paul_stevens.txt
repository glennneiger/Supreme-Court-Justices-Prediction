justice
john
paul

suppose
that
they
had
beat
him
up
two
or
three
times.
the
first
time
it
didn't
relate
to
it,
but
then
they
took
him
into
the
interrogation
room
and
they
beat
him
up
again.
what
about
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
be
two
causes
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
get
it
straight
at
the
beginning,
what
if
the
claim
includes
a
fifth
amendment
claim
for
extorting
a
conviction
and
it's
mixed
up
with
a
fourth
amendment
claim?
what
about
that
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
this
practical
problem?
i
think
what
you
say
fits
together
beautifully
with
regard
to
the
law,
but
isn't
it
true
that
this
will
give
an
incentive
in
every
criminal
case
for
the
defendant
to
file
a
1983
action.
so
we
may
multiply
the
number
of
federal
cases
that
are
filed
and
then
sit
there
while
a
criminal
case
proceeds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
your
opponent's
rule
is
adopted,
they
wouldn't
file
unless...
if
they
get
convicted
and
the
conviction
stands
up,
the
case
would
never
be
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
i
just
want
you
to
comment
on
is,
my
thought
is
every
person
arrested
has
a
potential,
and
something
follows
and
so
forth,
has
a
potential
fourth
amendment
claim,
even
though
he
may
not
have
one
on
the
merits.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
potential
here
of
an
awful
lot
of
what
may
turn
out
to
be
frivolous
claims
filed,
but
it
would
seem
to
be
routine
procedure
for
defense
lawyers
who
want
to
make
a
suppression
motion
to
say,
well,
i
better
file
my
1983
case
at
the
same
time.
so
you
might
get
literally
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases.
