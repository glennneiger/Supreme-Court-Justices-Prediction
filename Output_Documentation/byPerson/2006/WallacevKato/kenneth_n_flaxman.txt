mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
court
with
the
question
it
addressed
in
heck
versus
humphrey
raised
in
a
slightly
different
context.
the
context
in
heck
was
of
a
prisoner
whose
conviction
had
been
affirmed
who
was
in
prison,
who
had
filed
a
civil
rights
case
that
would
have
had
the
practical
effect
of
collaterally
challenging
his
criminal
conviction.
the
context
in
this
case
is
of
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
who
has
prevailed
in
his
criminal
case,
who
was
imprisoned
for
8-1/2
years
fighting
the
criminal
case
and
comes
to
federal
court
with
a
section
1983
action
saying,
i
now
seek
a
remedy
for
my
unconstitutional
incarceration,
and
files
his
lawsuit.
the
court
in
heck
held
that
this
action,
an
action
to
recover
damages
for
unconstitutional
conviction
or
imprisonment,
accrues
when
the
conviction
is
set
aside.
that's
the
principle
that
we
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
and
the
court
of
appeals
said:
we're
not
going
to
apply
that
because
we
will
adopt
a
categorical
rule
without
any
implied
exceptions
whatsoever
that
says
when
you're
arrested
you
have
2
years,
which
is
the
statute
of
limitations
in
1983
cases
in
illinois,
to
file
your
claim
for
damages.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
that
was
one
view
of
the
core
problem.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
in
heck
the
court
solves
the
core
problem
by
concluding...
by
denying
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
until
the
criminal
case
had
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
civil
rights
claimant,
which
is
the
rule,
the
common
law
rule
for
malicious
prosecution.
that's
the
solution
that
the
court
came
up
with
in
heck,
which
is
the
solution
that
the
petitioner
believes
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case,
as
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
petition
for
rehearing--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--absolutely.
in
criminal
cases
there's
discovery
and
the
criminal
defendant
knows
what
the
prosecution--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--you
do
know
because
it's
disclosed
in
discovery.
we
don't
do
trial
by
ambush
any
more
in
criminal
cases.
the
defendant
knew
that
all
the
evidence
against
him
was
the
alleged--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
for
murder
in
illinois.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
he's
incarcerated
that
whole
time
awaiting
the
filing
of
charges,
then
his
cause
of
action
would
not
have
accrued.
but
the
more
likely
scenario
is
that
he
would
be
arrested--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--if
the
claim
was
solely
directed
at
the
arrest,
then
your
honor
would
be
absolutely
correct.
the
claim
in
this
case,
the
cause
of
action,
is
not
that
he
was
taken
off
the
street
without
probable
cause.
the
core
of
the
cause
of
action
is
that
the
respondent
police
officers
exploited
that
arrest
to
get
this
untruthful
confession
that
was
used
to
hold
mr.
wallace
in
custody
for
8-1/2
years,
to
seize
him
for
8-1/2
years.
it's
not
just
the
arrest.
it's
the
arrest
plus
exploiting
it.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
under
malley
versus
briggs,
it
doesn't
break
the
chain
of
causation
if
we
adhere--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
there
was
no
other
evidence
presented
to
the
magistrate
or
that
could
have
been
presented
to
the
magistrate
other
than
the
confession
to
show--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--if
there's
some
additional
evidence,
we
could
not
say
was
necessarily...
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
and
would
be...
that's
not
our
situation.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
would
not
say...
well,
it
would
make
it
a
different
case.
but
if
i
was
arguing
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
little
bit
of
evidence,
but
not
enough
to
say
there's
probable
cause
to
accuse
him
of
a
crime,
i
would
say
that
suppressing
or
eliminating
the
confession
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
any
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
what
i
think
it
means
is
that
there's
no
conviction...
what
i
think
it
should
mean...
and
i'm
not
trying
to
debate
the
dictionary,
what
i
think
it
should
mean
is
that
if
there
is
no
evidence
other
than
after...
that
is
excluded,
to
base
a
prosecution
on,
as
in
this
case
where
the
man
is
let
go,
because
there
is
no
evidence
to
prosecute
him,
that
that
does
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
unless
that
witness
could
say
and
the
man
who
i
saw
then
is
the
defendant
in
this...
is
the
criminal
defendant,
mr.
wallace.
there
was
an
eyewitness
in
this
case.
and
he
could
not
make
an
in-court
identification
of
mr.
wallace.
and
the
prosecutor
realized
that
that
wasn't
enough
evidence
on
which
to
base
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
gave
up.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
that
would
have
been
very
unfair
if
they
withheld...
they
ambushed
the
defendant
with--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
we
didn't
know
that
because
there
weren't
any,
because
this
man
didn't
commit
that
crime.
we
are
talking...
in
the
hypothetical,
i
think
we
should
set,
start
with
mr.
wallace
being
an
innocent
man,
who
was
arrested
unlawfully,
who
gives
an
involuntarily...
an
involuntary
false
confession.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
is
held
for
eight
and
a
half
years,
finally
wins
the
case,
is
set
free,
and
then
sues
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--other
than
the
fact--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
tort
is
against
the
police
officers
who
made
an
unlawful
arrest
and
exploited
it
to
get
the
evidence
that
was
used
to
hold
mr.
wallace.
the,
the
problem
with
saying
that
mr.
wallace
has
to
sue,
as
soon
as
he
files
his
motion
to
suppress,
he
should
have
filed
his
section
1983
action,
would
produce
a
multitude
of
1983
actions.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
if
excessive
force
was
used
against
somebody
when
they're
being
arrested,
that's
a
claim
that
everyone
agrees
accrues
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
this
case
would
necessarily
impair
the
validity
of
the
conviction.
if--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
you
had
to
wait
because
it
would...
it
would
be
a
fruitless
act
to
file
the
case
while
the
case...
file
a
federal
case
while
the
state
criminal
case
was
pending.
but--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that
claim
would--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--you
can
sue
and
you
have
to
sue
for
the
battery
immediately.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
why
is
that
different?
because
this--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well
the
conviction
generally
does
stand
with...
the
battery
generally
has
nothing
to
with
the
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
you
wait.
or
if
it
is
an
element
of
what
could
be
the
defense
in
a
criminal
case.
but
getting
back
to
the
heck
question,
in
heck
the
court
looked
to
the
common
law
for
the
appropriate
rule
to
apply
to
the
cause
of
action
that
mr.
heck
was
applying.
if
we
look
to
the
common
law
for
the
appropriate
rule
for
mr.
wallace,
we
don't
come
up
with
the
seventh
circuit's
rule
of
immediate
accrual.
we
come
up
with
the
rule--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
we
don't
know
before
the
criminal
case
starts
whether
mr.
wallace
will
receive
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
his
fourth
amendment
claim.
and
until
we
know
that
we
don't
say
stone
versus
powell
would
bar
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
we
don't
know
that
the
state
will
give
mr.
wallace
an
attorney
who
can
stay
awake,
who
can
file
a
motion,
who
knows
that
there
is
a
fourth
amendment,
and
mr.
wallace
might
end
up
not
getting
a
full
and
fair
hearing
and
might
have
a
valid
claim
cognizable
with
federal
habeas
corpus
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no.
but
there
are
some.
it
is
not
a
non-existent
occurrence
in.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
civil
trial
will
be
stayed
pending
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
would
be
on
the
district
court's
docket
for
ten
years
waiting
the
final--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
would,
well,
it
would
be
a
horrible--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--a
horrible
mess
for
the
district
court.
it
would
not
work
because--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
district
judge
will
not
allow
a
civil
case
to
go
forward
because
it
would
allow
the
criminal
defendant--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
mean,
i,
i
shudder
to
think
of
20,000
cases
on
district
court
dockets
being
stayed
while
criminal
cases
are
being
resolved.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
we
have
one.
the
criminal
defendant
will
be
disinclined
to
file
his
civil
rights
case
on
time
because
it
will
be
used
against
him
in
his
criminal
case
to
impeach
his
bias.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it
will
impeach
his
bias.
if
he,
when
he
testifies
in
the
criminal
case,
he
will
be
cross-examined,
aren't
you
seeking
money
damage
from
the
police
officers?
don't
you
want
to
make
money
from
this
case?
and
the
jury
will
consider
that
when
they
weigh
the
truthfulness
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--not
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
that
cross-examination
will
occur
every
time
a
civil--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--there
are
appeals
and.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
i
am
absolutely
confident
the
illinois
courts
at
the
highest
level
will
say
that
is
proper
cross-examination.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
have
four
answers.
i
hope
i
can
get
them
out.
if
heck
instead
of
adopting
a
rule
of
accrual
and
denying
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
had
established
the
federal
tolling
rule,
saying
that
these
causes
of
action
are
tolled
while
you're
in
custody,
that
would
have
solved
the
problem.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i,
i...
the
court
certainly
can
do
it.
it
would
require
carving
a
hole
into,
into
tomiano
with
this--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--unless
state
law
is
inconsistent
with
federal
board
of
regents
versus
tomiano,
i
think
the
court
could
say
that.
the
other
thing
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
is
that
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
think
four
other
circuits
follow
the
common
law
rule
that
you
can't
have
a
1983
action
about
a
false
arrest
if
you
have
been
convicted
of
the
charge
on
which
you
were
arrested.
so
these
cases
would
not
be
brought
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
tolling,
a
federal
tolling
rule
for
this
cause
of
action,
while
someone
in
custody
although
a
criminal
conviction
is,
has
not
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
criminal
defendant,
would
be
an
excellent
solution.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
i
think
the
court
could
say
without
overruling
anything
that
there,
in
this
the
state
law
does
not
fully
reflect
or
protect
the
federal
rights
at
stake
here.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
but
the
officers
will
also
get
the
benefit
of
not
being
sued
if
there
is
a
conviction
based
on
the
charge
for
which
the
person
was
arrested.
that
case
would
not
be
brought,
especially
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
there
is
no
cause
of
action...
and
it
wouldn't
be
brought
anywhere
because
there's
no
damages
if
you
are
arrested
and
properly
convicted
and
serving
sentence.
those
cases
just
are
not
going
to
exist;
the
officers
would
have
that
benefit.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
the
seventh
circuit's
view
about
what
the
cause
of
action
is,
which
goes
back
to
what
is
the
cause
of
action
and
when
does
it
accrue?
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
cause
of
action
starts
when
you're
arrested
and...
either
at
the
time
of
arraignment
of,
as
they
said
in
a
subsequent
case,
when
there's
a
gerstein
probable
cause
hearing.
in
i
think
every
other
circuit,
the
cause
of
action
doesn't
end
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
it
continues
until
the
time
that
you're
released
from
being
in
custody.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
asked
you
to
consider
damages
but
i
think...
as
a
question
of
damages,
and
there
are
many
issues
related
to
damages
that
would
have
been
presented
in
question
to--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
common
law
false
arrest
claim
would
allow
damages
up
until
the
time
you
were
released
from
the
imprisonment,
which
is
not
at
the
time
of--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--not
for
a
false
arrest.
as
long
as
you're
not
convicted.
so
malicious
prosecution,
you
would--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct.
the
common
law
element...
malicious
prosecution
requires
that
the
innocence
or
grounds
not
consistent
with
guilt,
but
there's
no
such
element
in
the
common
law
false
imprisonment,
which
would
accrue
when
you
are
released
from
being
in
prison,
which
would
benefit
mr.
wallace
in
this
case.
when
the
seventh
circuit
talked
about
there
are
three
alternatives
that
we
have
to
choose
from,
the
proof
immediately,
the
case
by
case
of
when
it
accrues,
or
it
only
accrues
at
the
end
of
the
case,
they
didn't
consider
the
fourth
possibility
of
the
common
law
rule
that
it
occurs
when
the
imprisonment
ends.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
but
he's
not
going
to
file
his
civil
rights
claim
until
his
criminal
case
is
over,
because
he
knows
and
his
lawyer
will
tell
him,
that's
going
to
hurt
you
in
winning
the
criminal
case,
and
you
should
be
concerned
about
that.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
mr.
wallace
had
been
arrested
and
released,
he
would
have
had
two
years
from
when
he
was
released
to
bring
a
civil
rights
action,
that
being
false
imprisonment--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
the
same
as
when
someone
is
convicted
of
battery,
and
then
10
years
later,
the
victim
of
the
battery
dies
from
the
injury
caused
by
the
battery.
there
would
be
a
second
prosecution
for
murder
that
would
not
be
barred
from
double
jeopardy.
i
think
that's
diaz
versus
united
states.
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
i
think
he
would
have
two
actions.
he'd
have
the
action
for
being
arrested
and
then
he'd
have
the
action
later
when
the...
when
he
was
seized
because
of
the
unlawful...
the
fruits
of
the
unlawful
arrest.
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
those
cases
are
going
to
arise
even
less
frequently
than
the
stone
versus
powell
cases
that
are
brought
properly
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
a
federal
tolling
rule
would
solve
these
problems.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
at
the
time
they
beat
him
up,
unless
the
beating
up
relates
to
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
the
beating
up
is...
if
the
beating
up
is
related
to,
used
to
extort
a
confession
and
the
confession
is
used
against
him,
then
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
when
the
confession
is
used.
mr.
kenneth

multiple
causes,
yes.
there
could
be
at
least
two.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
you
want
to
get
damages
for
being
beaten
up,
i
would
tell
my
client
to
sue
right
away.
i
would
also
tell
my
client
if
he's
being
charged
with
a
serious
criminal
crime
offense,
to
wait
until
the
criminal
case
is
over,
because
it
will
hurt
you.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
but
criminal
cases
are
not
commenced
many,
many
years
after
the
unlawful
arrest,
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
we're
talking
about
complicated
financial
crimes,
that's
not
unusual.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
we're
talking
about
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
are
involved
with
this
kind
of,
with
street
crime,
with
murder,
armed
robbery,
rape,
the
defendant
is
not
allowed
to
let
them
run
over
two
years.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
those
are
the
defendants
who
get
unlawfully
arrested
and
are
forced
to
give
confessions.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time?
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
issue
that
has
been
sitting
in
this
case
like
the
elephant
in
the
room
is
what
is
mr.
wallace's
cause
of
action?
is
it
a
cause
of
action
for
being
seized
until
he
was
arraigned?
or
is
it
a
cause
of
action
for
being
seized
for
the
eight
and
a
half
years
that
he
was
locked
up
until
he
was,
the
criminal
case
was
resolved
in
his
favor?
my
sister
argues
that
it
was
just,
the
federal
remedy
is
only
until
you're
being
arraigned,
and
that
the
state
remedy
for
malicious
prosecution
doesn't
exist
if
the
seventh
circuit
has
construed
illinois
law
to
say
that
there
is
no
malicious
prosecution
when
you
win
the
federal
case,
when
you
win
the
criminal
case,
because
the
evidence
has
been
suppressed.
the
false
imprisonment,
state
false
imprisonment
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court,
under
his
reading
of
illinois
law
that
the
cause
of
action
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
not
at
the
time
he
was
released.
and
the
seventh
circuit
when
that
issue
was
raised
on
appeal
to
them
in
a
brief
by
both
sides
chose
to
reject
it
without
discussion.
what,
the
cause
of
action
that
respondent
proposes
is
none,
for
the
eight
and
a
half
year
seizure.
there
is
no
state
cause
of
action
in
illinois.
and
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action.
it
is
just
tough.
you
are
seized
for
eight
and
a
half
years,
and
you
can't
go
to
state
court,
you
can't
go
to
federal
court.
you
should
have
sued
immediately
after
you
were
arrested
to
get
a
little
bit
of
damages,
but
that's
all
you
can
get.
and
have
a
nice
day;
we're
sorry.
that,
i
don't
think
is
consistent
with
heck.
i
don't
think
it
is
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
about
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
i
don't
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
should
not
be
the
rule
that
the
court
adopts.
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
isn't
really
a
problem
because
all
of
the
evidence
that's
material
to
the
legality
of
the
arrest,
to
the
legality
and
the...
whether
the
confession
was
the
proximate...
was
proximately
caused
by
the
arrest
or
proximately
caused
by
the
incarceration,
has
been
developed
in
the
criminal
case.
when
there's
very
strong
interest
in
seeing
that
the
facts
are
fully
determined
and
fairly
determined
for
both
sides.
it
is
not
that
the
police
officer
who
sued
eight...
eight
and
a
half
years
later
is
much
less
is
much
less
prejudiced
than
mr.
wallace
is,
who
comes
out
of
prison
after
eight
and
a
half
years
with
no
remedy.
the
questions
about
the
multiple
causes
of
action
that
can
arise:
if
you're
beaten,
you
have
to
sue
immediately
after
you're
beaten;
if
you're
beaten
but
a
confession
is
extorted
from
you,
your
right
to
sue
starts
with
the
confession
is
used
against
you
at
trial...
and
if
there's
some
constitutional
violation
which
necessarily
impairs
the
conviction,
then
you
can
sue
after
you
successfully
defended
a
criminal
case...
is
really
an
administrative
nightmare
that
really
could
be
solved
by
a
federal
tolling
rule
that
all
section
1983
cases
are
tolled;
the
statute
does
not
start
to
run
until
the
criminal
case
has
been
resolved.
in
most
cases,
then,
instead
of
being
filed
in
district
court--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
starts
to
run
when
the
criminal
case
is
over.
that
will
weed
out
all
of
the
really
nonsensical
cases
that
would
otherwise
be
filed
under
respondent's
rule,
when
you
file
the
1983
action
the
same
day
you
file
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
district
judge
says
well,
this
goes
on
my
state
calendar
of
5,000
cases
and
the
clerk's
office
is
troubled
with
collecting
the
$350
filing
fee
in
installments,
and
the
jails
are
troubled
by
paying
those
installments
every
time
there's
$10
in
the
prisoner's
account.
it's...
it
would...
there
are
more
important
things
for
the
courts,
the
prisons
to
do.
thank
you.
