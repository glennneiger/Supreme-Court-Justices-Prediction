chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument--
next
in
wallace
versus
kato
and
roy.
mr.
flaxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
he
did
not
know
that
for
years
later.
i
mean,
they
don't
have
to
bring
a
prosecution
immediately.
they
can
wait
until
the
day
before
the
statute
of
limitations
runs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
they
can
wait
a
long
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
point,
the
whole
point
of
heck
was
to
avoid
1983
becoming
an
end
run
around
habeas.
but
here
you
don't
have
that
problem
because
you
don't
have
any
available
relief
under
habeas
under
stone
versus
powell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
it
would
require
overruling
our
cases
that
say
for
tolling,
your
borrow
state
law--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
then
you
deny
the
officers
the
purpose
you
have
for
the
reason
you
have
statutes
of
limitation,
which
is
repose.
they
are
going
to
wait
ten
years
instead
of
the
two
years
to
find
out
if
they
are
going
to
have
to
answer
any
claim
for
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he's
never
going
to
know,
in
the
case
where
there's
no
statute
of
limitations,
he's
never
going
to
know
when
his
criminal
case
is
going
to
be
over
because
he
may
never
know
when
it's
going
to
start.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
happens
if
he
files
a
suit
after
one
year
and
then
after
one
year
and
350
days
he's
prosecuted?
his
action
accrued
but
then
it
didn't
accrue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
his
action
accrued
and
maybe
it's
even
over,
but
then
it
turns
out
when
they
bring
the
prosecution,
it
should
have
never
have
been
brought
because
it
never
accrued.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
flaxman.
ms.
solomon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it
would
make
a
difference
to
the
officers,
a
principle
of
equitable
tolling.
they
don't
know
if
they're
going
to
be
sued
for
10
years,
12
years,
however
long.
under
an
accrual
rule
with
a
stay,
they
know
whether
they're
going
to
be
facing
a
civil
action
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
not
going
to
waste
a
lot
of
time
figuring
out
whether
to
grant
a
stay
or
not
when
you
have
a
criminal
prosecution
pending
in
state
court.
i
think
in
most
cases...
i
mean,
it's
not
like
they're
looking
for
cases.
they're
going
to
say
in
most
cases:
stay
granted,
come
back
when
this
is
over.
they
don't
have
to
be...
unlike
perhaps
the
situation
with
an
equitable
tolling
rule,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they're
precisely
right
or
wrong.
i
mean,
if
it's
close
enough
just
stay
it,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
there's
much
prejudice
from
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
solomon.
mr.
flaxman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
no.
05-1240,
wallace
versus
kato.
