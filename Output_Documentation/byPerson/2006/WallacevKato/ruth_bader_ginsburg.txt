mr.
flaxman,
one
starting
point.
you
say
that
this
case
should
be
just
like
heck,
but
in
heck
the
core
problem
was
the
line
between
1983
and
habeas,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
least
this
case
involves
no
such
concern
about
habeas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
said
in...
quickly
in
passing
that
the
damages
would
run
only
from
the
time
of
the
allegedly
unlawful
arrest
until
the
time
of
arraignment.
that
would,
that
would
be
the...
be
all
of
your
damages.
if
there
wasn't
an
arraignment,
whatever
happens
is
not
attributed
to
the
seizure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
asked
us
to
take
that
case
and
we
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
that's
the
boundaries
of
the
false
arrest
claim,
then
why
does
one
happen
later
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
miss
solomon,
do
i
gather
from
your
response
to
justice
stevens
about
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
that
under
chavez
it
wouldn't
accrue
until
it
is
used
at
trial,
is
this
case
therefore
a
pleading
slip
on
petitioner's
part?
that
is,
if
he
had
alleged
a
fifth
amendment
claim
based
on
the
coerced
confession,
then
he
wouldn't
have
a
statute
of
limitations
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
puzzling
feature
of
it,
too,
because
i
thought
at
the
end
the
second
time
around,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
confession
was
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
your
position
in
this
case
leave
any
reason
at
all
for
equitable
tolling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
remedy
that
illinois
law
provides
for
a
case
like
this
where
a
person
spends,
what
was
it,
eight
years
in
prison
and
is
ultimately
released
because
the
state
never
had
enough
evidence
to
try
him
in
the
first
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with
judge
wood
that
the
limitation
on
damages
would
be
from
the
period,
from
the
time
of
the
arrest
until
the
arraignment?
that
would
be
the
measure
and
nothing
after?
