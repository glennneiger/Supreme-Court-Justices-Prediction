ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
submission
this
morning
rests
on
the
proposition
that
the
victim
of
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
has
the
right
to
sue
as
soon
as
that
fourth
amendment
violation
occurs.
for
purposes
of
accrual
of
that
claim,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
victim
is
subsequently
prosecuted
or
whether
he
is
subsequently
convicted.
accordingly,
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
claim
accrued
for
purposes
of
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
as
soon
as
his
unlawful
arrest
and
detention
occurred,
and
his
lawsuit
filed
some
nine
years
later
is
time
barred.
the
claim
accrued--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
believe
that
the
rule
for
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
i
believe
the
court's
view
in
chavez
is
that
a
coerced
confession
claim
has
as
an
element
of
the
claim,
the
use
of
that
claim
at
trial.
so
it
would
be
our
view
if
that
is
an
element
of
the
claim,
that
that
claim
would
not
accrue
until
trial.
a
claim--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--exactly.
a
claim
for
conscience
shocking
techniques
to
obtain
the
confession
or
the
excessive
force
to
obtain
the
confession,
both
of
those
claims,
and
use
of
the
confession
at
trial
is
not
an
element
of
those
claims,
and
those
claims
would
accrue
at
the
time
of
those
acts,
just
like
the
fourth
amendment
rule
that
we
urge
in
this
case.
only
where
there
is
a
trial
right
and
use
of
some
evidence
at
trial,
suppression
of
evidence
at
trial,
something
of
that
order,
if
the
trial
right
is
implicated,
that
claim
would
not
accrue
until
at
trial.
that
is
different
from
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
of
course,
because--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--he
brought
two
claims
in
his
criminal
case.
he
lost
them
both
in
the
illinois
circuit
court
at
the
time
of
his
suppression
motion.
he
pursued
only
one
of
those
on
appeal
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
and
the
circuit
court
made
findings
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
so
at
the
outset,
there
were
problems
with
that
claim
going
into
federal
court.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
the
illinois
appellate
court
overturned
the
conviction
on
the
basis
that
it
was
obtained
through
use
of
a
confession
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
only.
the
only
findings
that
have
ever
been
made
regarding
mr.
wallace's
confession,
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
were
made
in
the
illinois
circuit
court,
and
the
finding
was
that
the
confession
was
voluntary,
that
it
was
not
coerced.
that
finding
has
never
been
reviewed.
petitioner
did
file
both
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
claims
in
this
civil
case,
but
we
did
not
assert
statute
of
limitations
to
the
fifth
amendment
claim
for
precisely
the
reasons
that
i
indicated
to
justice
stevens.
and
for
that
reason,
although
the
question
was
presented
in
the
petition,
we
did
not
acquiesce
in
the
fifth
amendment
portion
of
question
1
of
the
petition,
and
the
court
did
not
grant
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
so
i
do
not
believe...
a
short
answer,
sorry...
i
do
not
believe
it
was
a
pleading
error.
it
is
simply
that
that
claim
as
the
litigation
developed
is
not
before
this
court
now,
but
not
through
a
simple
pleading
error.
it
is
a
far
more
weighty
problem
than
that.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i'm
sorry.
if
i
indicated
that,
i
definitely
misspoke.
in
our
view,
all
fourth
amendment
claims
except
for
those
that
do
negate
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
those
are
described
in
footnote
6
of
heck,
with
that
exception,
all
fourth
amendment
claims
should
be
regarded
as
accruing
at
the
time
that
the
act
that
actually
violates
the
fourth
amendment
occurs.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
because
the
rule
of
accrual
is
that
the
act...
the
claim
accrues
when
the
plaintiff
experiences
an
injury.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
well,
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
the
court
is
making
up
a
rule
of
accrual.
i
think
those
rules
are
quite
well
settled.
cases
like
ricks
and
chardon
make
clear,
and
the
fourth
amendment
cases
make
clear
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
unlike
the
fifth,
where
evidence
is
used
at
trial,
the
fourth
amendment
claim
violation
is
fully
accomplished
at
the
time
of
the
illegal
search
or
seizure.
anything--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--well,
the
prosecutor
would
be
absolutely
immune,
of
course.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
and
some
of
those
cases
are
brought
against
the
police
officers.
but,
the
reasons
that
would
suggest
a
certain
accrual
date
for
the
fifth
amendment
claim
are
very
different
from
the
reasons
that
dictate
the
accrual
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
at
the
time...
the
only
action
the
petitioner
alleges
violated
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
case
was
when
his
detention
at
the
police
station,
which
was
consensual
at
the
outset,
became
unconsensual,
became
involuntary
at
some
point
before
he
confessed.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
that's
correct.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
we
do...
our
position
is
that
they
do
occur
when
they
happen
and
they
must
be
filed
within
the
limitations,
yes.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
if
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
claim
being
raised
in
the
criminal
case,
and
of
course,
it
might
not
be,
but
that
is
a
very
easy--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--justice
breyer,
that
is
correct.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
think
those
are
essentially
the
two
choices,
with
one
caveat.
we
would
call
it
an
accrual
rule
as
opposed
to
a
tolling
rule,
for
the
reason
that
this
court
has
always
respected
the
tolling
rules
that
states
have
whereas
accrual
is
a
federal
question.
but
with
that
slight
caveat,
i
do
believe
that
those
are
the
two
main
options.
but
i
don't
believe
the
court
should
be
indifferent
as
between
them.
there
are
very
serious
practical
reasons
weighing
down
on
our
rule,
which
is
a
rule
of
immediate
accrual
and
filing
not
immediately,
of
course...
the
case
need
only
be
filed
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
thereafter
it
might
well
be
that
some
cases,
maybe
many
cases,
maybe
nearly
all
cases,
would
need
a
stay
of
some
sort
while
the
federal...
excuse
me...
while
the
criminal
case
is
ongoing.
but
that
question,
figuring
out
whether
a
stay
is
warranted
in
order
to
avoid
interference
with
a
ongoing
state
prosecution,
is
far
easier
to
figure
out
than
whether
the
evidence
is
the
only
evidence,
whether
it's
critical
evidence,
whether
there
was
other
evidence.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
also--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--that
is
the
second
major
advantage
that
we
see
to
our
rule,
chief
justice
roberts.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
accepting
your
earlier
construct
where
there
really
are
essentially
two
rules,
we
either
delay
accrual
or
we--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
rule
that
we
propose,
which
is
immediate
accrual
coupled
with
a
stay
of
some
sort
if
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
being
actively
litigated
in
the
state
court
at
that
time,
has
two
advantages.
the
first
is
that
it
does
serve
the
purposes
that
all
statutes
of
limitations
serve,
which
is
it
puts
the
defendant
on
notice
you
are
now
the
defendant
in
a
lawsuit,
you
should
be
marshalling
your
evidence,
you
should
be
preserving
your
records,
and
you
are
not
in
repose.
this
court
has
respected
those
as
very
important
interests.
they
are
absolutely
not
served
by
a
rule
of
delayed
accrual.
at
the
same
time,
the
rule
to
allow
a
stay
where
necessary...
as
i
indicated,
it's
not
going
to
be
all
of
the
cases,
and
it's
far
easier
to
figure
it
out.
the
federal
district
court
figures
it
out
by
having
the
defendant,
the
criminal
defendant,
who
is
a
plaintiff
in
his
court,
come
in
and
is
asked
a
question:
are
you
currently--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
wouldn't
have
any
objection
to
a
rule
that--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
think
the
assumption,
your
honor,
should
be
that
the
number
of
cases
is
going
to
be
the
same
either
way.
it's
just
a
question
of
when
are
they
filed
and,
moreover--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--well,
it's
curious
that
they
make
that
argument,
because
of
course
every
victim
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
has
the
right
to
damages
for
at
least
the
invasion
of
their
privacy,
for
the
antecedent
conduct
between
the
time
of
arrest
and
charging.
at
a
minimum,
mr.
wallace
had
that
coming
to
him
because
he
was,
according
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
illegally
seized.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
with
respect,
your
honor,
we'll
take
that
chance
for
the
benefits
that
the
statute
of
limitations
does
bring
to
the
officer.
and
as
far
as
the
burden
on
the
court,
whether
all
cases
are
stayed
or
some
cases
are
stayed,
of
course,
we're
content
to
have
this
court
or
the
district
court
handling
the
case
figure
that
out.
but
the
main
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
a
rule
of
delayed
accrual
wholly
undermines
the
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
where
the
plaintiff's
interest,
the
claimant's
interests,
can
be
served,
as
i
indicated,
at
a
minimum
every
victim
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
has
the
right
to
some
damages.
that
is
actually
precisely
why
we
say
that
fourth
amendment
claims
do
not
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
it
may
be
not
in
a--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--he
has
tried
way
more
of
them
than
i
have
as
well,
and
i
can't
speak
to
that
specifically.
it's
not
an
argument
that
was
ever
made
in
the
briefs.
but
again,
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
federal
district
court
can't
take
account
of
whatever
it
needs
to
take
account
of
in
order
to
avoid--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--yes.
yes,
i
understand.
but
all
that
has
to
happen,
of
course,
is
that
the
complaint
be
put
on
file
in
the
federal
court.
it's
notice
pleading.
it
can
be
a
very,
very
long
complaint.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
well,
but
as
i
indicated,
every
victim
of
a
fourth
amendment
rights,
even
those
who
are
guilty,
even
those
who
are
convicted...
that's
the
herring
case.
herring
exactly
shows--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
would
imagine
that
it
would
cut
both
ways
in
many
cases,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
speak
to
it
more
specifically
than
that.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
it
does,
your
honor,
absolutely.
equitable
tolling
is
always
available
in
an
extraordinary
case
when
the
plaintiff
could
not
put
a
complaint
on
file
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
unlike
the
accrual
question,
as
indicated
a
moment
ago,
the
tolling
is
governed
by
the
states.
in
this
case,
for
example,
because
mr.
wallace
was
only
15
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
his
claim
was
tolled.
he
actually
had
nearly
four
years
beyond
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
to
put
a
complaint
on
file
and
it
still
would
have
been
toll...
would
have
been
timely.
he
filed
outside
even
that
time.
illinois
does
not
toll
for
prisoners,
but
many
states
do,
as
the
court
indicated
in
the
hardin
case.
so
there's
all
sorts
of
tolling
available,
or
could
be
under
state
law.
mr.
wallace
has
actually
never
urged
tolling
in
this
case
and
i
assume
that
that's
because
there
is
no
basis
for
that
under
state
law.
he
did
get
the
advantage
already
of
the
time
when
he
was
a
minor
and
there
is
no
other
basis
under
illinois
law
that
would
allow
him
any
basis
for
tolling.
but
of
course,
tolling
is
proper
when
the
plaintiff
does
not
know
and
could
not
know
that
his
rights
were
violated.
if
mr.
wallace
was
illegally
seized,
he
was
right
there
when
it
happened.
he
might
not
have
known
that
a
court
would
ultimately
accept
his
argument
on
that,
but
of
course
the
plaintiff
never
has
a
right
to
be
told
that
he
has
a
successful
claim
before
he
brings
that
claim.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
in
many
cases,
the
state
law
of
malicious
prosecution
will
provide
a
remedy.
of
course,
in
illinois
and
in
all
states,
it
requires
favorable
termination.
in
this
case,
of
course,
petitioner
conceded
long
ago
that
he
cannot
show
favorable
termination
because
the
circumstances
under
which
the
criminal
case
ended
did
not...
were
not
consistent
with
a
favorable
termination.
but,
of
course,
he
would
have
had
a
fourth
amendment
claim
if
he
had
filed
it
timely.
he
would
have
had
a
state
law
malicious
prosecution
claim
if
he
had
been
able
to
show
favorable
termination.
in
states
that
don't
have
malicious
prosecution,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
due
process
claim
as
well.
the
result
that
there
are
no
damages
available
to
somebody
when
the
conviction
is
overturned
solely
by
operation
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
however,
should
not
be
troubling
because
the
conviction
itself,
of
course,
was
not
an
independent
violation
of
the
constitution.
petitioner
did
receive
the
benefit
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
his
conviction
was
overturned.
we're
not
aware
of
any
case
indicating
that
deterrence
purposes
would
require
both
the
exclusion
of
evidence
and
a
damages
claim.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
well,
in
our
experience
the
district
courts
don't
tend
to
want
to
go
ahead.
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
the...
if
the
court
did,
rules
of
comity
are
sufficient
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
have
the
first
crack
at
issues
that
are
arising
in
the
criminal
cases,
to
be
the
ones
that--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--in
heck
and
in
younger.
there's
the
concurrence
in
deacons
against
monahan
indicates
that
a
claim
for
damages
should
be
stayed
and
not
dismissed
or
gone
forward
with.
justice
white's
concurrence
specifically
addressed
the
difference
between
dismissing
and
going
forward
with
the
claim.
of
course,
the
footnotes
8
and
9
in
the
heck
opinion
are
very
powerful
indications
of
the
weighty
reasons.
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
district
court
would
want
to
charge
ahead
with
a
claim
that
would...
with
a
case
that
will
only
get
simpler
if
it
waits
for
the
state
court
proceedings
to
conclude,
as
well
as
of
course
the
comity
and
respect
for
the
state
courts.
in
this
case,
of
course,
as
i
mentioned,
the...
mr.
wallace
always
had
a
claim
available
to
him
for
his
initial
seizure
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
his
criminal
prosecution.
if
he
wanted
to
seek
damages
for
that
prosecution
and
our
primary
submission,
part
one
of
our
brief
is
even
assuming
those
damage
might
be
available
on
a
fourth
amendment
claim,
he
was
nevertheless
obligated
to
bring
that
claim
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
because
otherwise
it
would
be
time
barred.
in
our
view,
petitioner
does
not
have
one
claim
for
that
arrest
and
another
claim
for
his
trial
and
prosecution.
he
has
one
claim
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation
with
two
elements
of
damages.
but
mounting
future
or
delayed
damages
do
not
delay
accrual.
even
where
the
plaintiff
does
not
know
the
full
extent
of
his
injuries,
he
still
must
sue
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
in
fact,
petitioner
does
not
cite
a
single
case
including
the
ones
newly
arrived
in
the
reply
brief
that
uses
either
his
accrual
rule
or
his
damages
rule
to
award
damages
for
the
entire
time
of
a
lengthy
period

termination.

his

but
our
primary
submission
in
this
court
is
that
regardless
of
the
damages
that
are
available
on
a
fourth
amendment
claim,
that
the
mounting
of
damages
did
not
delay
accrual,
and
without
a
timely
claim,
it
doesn't
matter
what
damages
the
plaintiff
is
seeking.
the
reference
in
heck
to
a
claim
for
damages
for
unconstitutional
conviction,
we
take
to
be
a
shorthand
for
a
claim
of
some
sort
of
constitutional
violation
that
can
be
brought
through
the
vehicle
of
section
1983
that
would
enable
the
plaintiff
to
recover
damages
for
the
incarceration.
1983
of
course
itself
does
not
create
any
substantive
rights.
the
plaintiff
needs
an
underlying
claim
and
in
this
case
of
course
the
plaintiff
only
has
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
we
do
have,
in
our
brief
and
argument
why
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
be
regarded
as
allowing
those
damages,
but
our
primary
submission
and
we
do
think
the
court
can
decide
the
case
without...
without
reaching
that
issue.
the
only
date
to
delay
an
accrual
in
this
case
was
the
date
that
the
charges
were
nol
prossed.
but
that
date
is
meaningless
for
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
is
therefore
meaningless
for
accrual.
we
would
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
