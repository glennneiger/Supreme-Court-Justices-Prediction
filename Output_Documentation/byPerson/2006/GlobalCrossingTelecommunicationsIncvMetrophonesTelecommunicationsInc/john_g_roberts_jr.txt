we'll

mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
your
answer
for
why
they
can't,
justice
souter's
comment
is
a
classic,
this
is
what
administrative
agencies
do
all
the
time
in
typical
rate
regulations.
they
make
a
determination
that
utility
shareholders
have
to
bear
this
cost.
the
rate
payers
can
bear
this
cost.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
is
a
determination
that
a
rate
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
just
what
is
involved
here.
i
don't
know
why
their
determination
about
how
to
allocate
who
has
to
collect
the
rates,
and
whether
they
can
pass
them
on
or
not
makes
it
an
impermissible
interpretation
of
what's
unjust
or
unreasonable
under
201.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
it
was
always
thought
of
as
being
triggered
by
276,
did
the
fcc
reference
201
in
issuing
its
determination
that
a
failure
to
follow
these
regulations
was
unjust
and
unreasonable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
cover
certain
practices
in
connection.
it
covers
all
practices
in
connection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that,
putting
aside
276,
it
would
clearly
be
impermissible
for
the
fcc
to
say
one
way
that
long
distance
carriers
provide
service
to
their
customers
is
when
those
customers
use
pay
phones;
and,
therefore,
we're
setting
up
this
rate
regime
in
connection
with
that
service.
you
would
say
that
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
201(a)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
englert?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
reasonably
criticized
for
it.
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
would
be
unjust
or
unreasonable
has,
for
generations,
been
given
a
very
expansive
reading.
and
you
don't
need
to
say
that
the
fcc
has
to
do
what
typically
i
would
have
thought
was
a
job
for
a
court,
which
is
to
determine
whether
there's
a
private
right
of
action
to
bring
its
action
within
a
boilerplate
term
like
unjust
or
unreasonable.
i
would
have
thought
the
contact
point
was
what
i
was
talking
about
with
mr.
fisher
earlier,
which
is
whether
or
not
this
is
such
communication
service
under
201(a),
which
is...
which
is,
again,
i
suppose,
something
that
the
agency
gets
deference
on.
but
it
would
seem
to
me,
that's
where
the
limitation
would
come.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
that's
also
why
i
guess
i
don't
regard
it
as
particularly
helpful
that
the
fcc
opines
on
what
the
consequences
of
its
determination
that
something
is
unjust
or
unreasonable
under
the
statute
are,
with
respect
to
a
private
right
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
saw
that
argument.
i
have
to
say
i
don't
understand
it.
why
is
it
so
difficult?
i
get
a
bill
every
month
that
easily
sorts
out
which
are
interstate
and
which
are
intrastate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
feldman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
a
position
on
whether
or
not
chevron
deference
is
owed
to
the
commission's
determination
of
whether
or
not
their
action
creates
or
gives
rise
to
a
right
of
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
two
different,
it
seems
to
me,
two
different
chevron
questions.
the
one
is
the
deference
on
its
interpretation
of
what's
unjust
and
unreasonable.
the
other
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
have
anything
to
say
about
whether
that
means
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
in
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
never
gotten
deference,
at
least
i
guess
from
this
court,
on
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
right...
whether
there
is
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
its
regulations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
have
a
different
position
here
if
276
said
something
like,
we
think
there
ought
to
be
more
pay
phones;
in
order
to
promote
investment
in
pay
phones,
we're
going
to
have
this
scheme.
in
other
words,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
fair
or
not,
it's
a
subsidy.
then
you'd
say
that
could
be
something
that's
not
covered
by
the
"just
and
reasonable"
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
true.
you
can
say
that
this
is
a
way
you
make
a
lot
of
money
from
your
customers
that
you
wouldn't
otherwise
make,
because
if
there
wasn't
a
pay
phone
there,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
your
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
cell
phone
example?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
know,
the
cell
phone
holder
may
be
right
next
to
the
pay
phone
or
he
may
be
across
the
country.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
