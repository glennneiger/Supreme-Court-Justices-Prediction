mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
under
sections
206
through
208
of
the
communications
act,
a
party
damaged
by
any
violation
of
the
communications
act
may
bring
an
action
either
in
federal
court
or
before
the
commission
to
obtain
damages.
the
scope
of
the
remedies
before
the
commission
under
the
kind
of
standard
primary
provision
of
the
act
that
deals
with
damages,
208,
and
207
mentions
it
as
well,
the
scope
of
the
action
before
the
commission
and
before
the
court
is
exactly
the
same.
now,
because
petitioner's...
therefore,
if...
well,
because
petitioner's
failure
to
pay
fair
compensation
to
respondent
was
an
unjust
or
unreasonable
practice--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
the
act
in
207...
i
believe
it's
207...
specifically
says
that
you
may,
the
court
may
award
attorneys'
fees
in
an
action
in
court.
it
doesn't
provide
that...
there's
no
similar
provision
for
actions
before
the
commission.
but
the
scope
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
decided
that
a
complainant
could
bring
either
to
the
commission
or
to
court
is
exactly
the
same.
there's
no
way
to
drive
a
wedge
between
them.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
act,
as
mr.
fisher
said,
where
congress
specifically
authorized
the
commission...
an
action
before
the
commission
for
damages.
but
those
are...
those
provisions
which
mr.
fisher
cited
are
in
section
226,
which
do
not
have
to
do
with
common
carriers.
they
have
to
do
with
automatic
dialing,
with
do-not-call
lists,
with
things
like
that,
where
the
person
who's
violating
it
is
definitely
not
the...
never
going
to
be
a
common
carrier.
in
those
provisions,
congress
found
it
necessary
to
say,
okay,
we
have
to
now
give
you
the
authority
to
create
a
damage
action.
but
in
other
provisions,
where
you
are
dealing
with
common
carrier,
206
through
208
provides
congress's
determination
of
what
the
scope
of
a
damage
action
should
be
either
before
the
commission
or
before
a
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that...
i
guess
we
don't
have
a
position
on
whether
276,
independent
of
201,
would
be
sufficient
to
have
a
prior
right
of
action
under
206
through
208.
but
as
for
201(b),
once...
the
fcc
does
certainly
gets
deference,
has
gotten
deference
for
a
hundred
years
for
its
determination
of
what
is
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
practice.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
and
i
don't
think
the
fcc
here
is
claiming
that
there's
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
its
regulations.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
under--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
but
208,
like
206...
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
the
question.
both
provisions
address
only
violations
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
so
in
order
for
the
fcc
to
decide
that
there's
an
action
either
before
the
agency
or
the
court,
it
has
to
identify
a
violation
of
the
statute.
here
it's
identified
201(b)
as
being
the
provision
that's
violated.
it's
absolutely
standard
for
a
hundred
years
that...
i
mean,
mr.
fisher
says,
well,
you
can't
look
at
201(b)
and
decide
who
is
supposed
to
pay
and
how
much
they're
supposed
to
pay.
that
is
absolutely
standard
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
you
can't
look
at
the
words
"just
and
reasonable"
and
decide
whether
a
rate
was
just
and
reasonable
or
the
practices
that
a
carrier
is
using
are
just
and
reasonable.
in
fact,
the
whole--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
i
would
add
also,
with
respect
to
the
commission's
determination
about
what
is
just
and
reasonable,
it
was
not
just
a
question
of
saying
that
a
violation
of
the
regulations
is
just
and
reasonable.
the
commission
was
charged
here
with
the
responsibility
for
adopting
a
compensation
scheme
that
would
provide
for
fair
compensation
for
each
pay
phone
operator
for
each
and
every
call.
and
it
spent
a
number
of
years
and
a
number
of
different
attempts
working
out
what
is
a
fair
compensation.
i
would
submit
that
all
of
that
reasoning
about
what
is
a
fair
compensation
scheme
is
also
reasoning
why
it's
unjust
and
unreasonable
for
a
carrier
not
to
pay
the
compensation.
it's
not
just
simply
a
question
of
an
ipse
dixit,
it's
a
question
of
years
of
rulemaking
and
working
out
what
the
scheme
should
be,
so
it's
fair.
once
it
did
that,
it
didn't
require
a
lot
of
explanation
for
why
a
failure
to
pay
fair
compensation
that
had
been
worked
out
over
this
period
of
time,
a
failure
to
pay
that
was
unjust
and
unreasonable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i'm
really
expanding
on
that
point,
that
it
didn't...
the
fcc
has
always
gotten
deference
for
what...
determining
what
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
under
the
act.
and
it
didn't
require
a
great
deal
of
explanation.
the
fcc's
explanation
here
was
more
than
adequate
in
light
of
its
years
of
explanation
about
why
this...
this
scheme
with
these
rates
and
these
carriers
and
the
primary
economic
beneficiary
being
the
one
who
pays.
all
of
that
were
reasons
why
this
was
fair
compensation.
once
it
decided
all
of
that,
it
didn't
take
much
to
say
that
a
failure
to
pay
fair
compensation
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
that
was
adequately
explained
and
didn't
require
a
huge
additional
amount
of
explanation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
in
that
case
also,
i
would
probably
be
here
arguing
that
maybe
if
the
fcc
had
determined
that
it's
necessary,
for
whatever
regulations
they
came
up
with
under
that
scheme,
in
order
for
the
act
to
function
correctly,
that
they
have
to
be
complied
with.
i
think
i
would
also
argue
that
that
was
unjust
and
unreasonable.
but
this
case,
if
the
question
is,
did
the
fcc
adequately
explain
what
it
did
here,
i
think
that
all
of
the
years
of
explanation
of
why
something
is
fair
are
also
reasons
why
it
was
unjust
and
unreasonable
not
to
pay
the
compensation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
there
probably
are.
mr.
englert
mentioned
a
couple.
i
mean,
there's
probably
numerous
ones
that
wouldn't
be.
and
in
fact,
the
question
about
most
fcc
action,
or
at
least
a
lot
of
fcc
action,
regulations,
adjudications,
and
so
on,
most
of
them
have
to
do
with
carriers'
obligations,
and
most
of
them
are
things
that
have
to
do
with
what's
unjust
and
unreasonable
under
the
act.
and
they've
been
enforced
for
years,
in
the...
you
know,
from
the
very
early
cases
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
fisher
also
suggested
that
there's
a
difficulty
with
numerous
district
courts
deciding
these
issues
as
opposed
to
the
fcc.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
congress
decided
that
these
kinds
of
actions
can
go
either
to
district
court
or
to
the
fcc.
and
in
fact,
by
making
damages
actions,
the
scope
of
damages
actions,
as
opposed
to
other
remedies,
co-extensive,
did
anticipate
that
there
would
be
that
result.
the
primary
jurisdiction--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that
that's
correct.
it
means
that
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
gives
the
agency
authority...
that
prohibits
unjust
and
unreasonable
action,
which
was
not
the
case
in
sandoval--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
think
it
is
possible
that
the
fcc
could
determine
that
any
violation
of
a
regulation
is
unjust,
and
the
fcc
is
entitled
to
deference
for
its
determinations
about
what
is
unjust
and
unreasonable,
that's
been--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
think
the
fcc's
determination
has
to
be
reasonable
under
the
ordinary
types
of
chevron
standards.
but,
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
questions
of
what's
just
and
unreasonable
over
the
years,
it
is...
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
the
agency
entrusted
with
determining
that
and
getting
the
communications
system
working
or
getting
common
carrier
systems...
common
carriers
to
fulfill
their
obligations,
does
have
a
lot
of
leeway
in
determining
what
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
that
context.
thank
you.
