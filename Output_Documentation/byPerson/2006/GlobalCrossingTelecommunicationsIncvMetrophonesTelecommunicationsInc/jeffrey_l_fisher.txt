mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
complaints
alleging
violations
of
the
fcc's
pay
phone
compensation
regulations
allege
just
that,
violations
of
regulations.
the
regulatory
violations
do
not
give
rise
to
private
cause
of
action
under
section
206
and
207
of
the
communications
act.
the
proper
point
of
departure
in
this
case
begins
at
section
276.
there
congress
directed
the
fcc
to
create
a
system
guaranteeing
pay
phone
providers
compensation
for
the
services
that
they
provide
to
callers
who
make
dial
around
calls.
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
fcc
has
ample
authority
to
enforce
the
system
it
created
administratively.
but
nothing
in
section
276
or
anywhere
else
in
the
act
contemplates
that
violations
of
the
fcc's
implementing
regulations
should
give
rise
to
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages
in
federal
court.
accordingly,
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
allowing
pay
phone
operators
to
bring
through
the
back
door
the
kinds
of
cases
that
congress
declined
to
allow
through
the
front.
there's
nothing
upsetting
about
reaching
that
result
here.
the
communications
act
quite
sensibly
limits
private
damages
actions
in
federal
court
to
those
alleging
violations
of
the
act
itself.
and
claims
that
long
distance
providers...
i'm
sorry...
claims
that
long
distance
providers
have
violated
the
pay
phone
compensation
regulations
require
the
parsing
and
the
application
of
the
extraordinarily
complex
and
ever-changing
fcc
rules
and
regulations
and
orders.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
our
position
is
that
can
be
fully
enforced
in
the
fcc.
and
in
fact,
the
fcc
is
hearing
complaints
like
this
all
the
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
by
means
of
an
administrative
action
before
the
fcc.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
if
you
look
at
the
sprint
amicus
brief
at
page
23,
the
brief
cites
several
cases
just
like
this
one
that
the
fcc
has
fully
adjudicated
and
in
some
cases
awarded
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
we
believe...
of
course,
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
this
court
holds
there
is
no
private
cause
of
action
in
federal
court,
then
it
is
not
enforceable
in
state
court
either.
our
position
is
that
there
is
only
an
administrative
remedy
that's
available.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
terms
of
damages,
we're
talking
about
exactly
the
same
thing,
justice
ginsburg.
the
only
difference
between
being
in
federal
court
as
opposed
to
the
agency
is
that
if
you're
in
federal
court,
the
communications
act
has
a
fee
shifting
provision.
and
we
think
that
further
underscores
the
congress's
scheme
here,
which
is
to
reserve
federal
court
actions
for
serious
violations
of
the
communications
act,
and
that's
where
fee
shifting
kicks
in.
ordinary--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
very
much
what
the
commission
is
contending
here
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
a
later
order,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
the
result
would
be
the
same.
and
i
think
you're
asking
me
to
put
aside
for
the
moment
whether
the
fcc
was
correct
in
saying
it
was
a
covered
practice.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
in
terms
of
the
fcc
calling
this
unjust
and
unreasonable,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
only
reason
the
fcc
has
ever
given
that
this
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
is
because
it
violates
its
regulations.
and
if
there's
one
thing
we
know
from
the
structure
of
the
communications
act,
it's
that
for
something
to
be
remedial
in
federal
court,
in
other
words...
and
if
we
know
something
violates
201,
it
is
remediable.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
has
to
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
because
the
reasoning
the
fcc
would
give
simply
would
not
be
a
permissible
construction
of
the
terms
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
201(b).
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
of
course,
in
the
vast
majority.
let
me
give
you
some
examples,
and
then
i'll
distinguish
it
from
this
case.
the
easiest
example
is
rate
of
return
regulations
that
the
fcc
can
pronounce.
so
the
fcc
can
say
how
much
long
distance
companies
are
able
to
charge
for
certain
services.
fleshing
out
the
amount
that
they
can
charge
so
that
they're
not
in
effect
gouging
consumers
is
a
regulation
that
this
court
could
look
to,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case,
justice
souter,
in
the
kind
of
regulations
that
we
have.
what
we
have
here
is
not
the
fcc
telling
long
distance
providers
to
give
pay
phone
operators
money
that
long
distance
operators
ought
to
owe
pay
phone
operators.
the
money
that's
at
issue
here,
the
24
cents
per
call
is
the
money
that
callers
owe
the
pay
phone
operators.
if
you
look
back
at
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
are
right,
justice
souter,
insofar
as
we're
trying
to
capture
the
money
here
for
essentially
the
equipment
rental
or
the
access
fee
that
the
caller
is
availing
himself
of.
but
congress
has
not
said
that
money
cannot
rest
on
the
caller's
shoulders.
all
congress
says
in
section
226
is
that
the
caller
cannot
be
required
to
pay
in
advance.
the
fcc
during
its
rulemaking
proceedings
actually
considered
two
alternatives
where
the
caller
would
have
paid
in
full
compliance
with
section
226.
one
would
be
the
caller
paying
with
a
later
billing
device
like
a
credit
card,
billing
it
to
their
home
phone
number.
another
option
the
fcc
considered
would
have
been
where
the
long
distance
providers
would
have
billed
customers
on
behalf
of
the
pay
phone
operators.
either
way,
the
customer
would
have
paid.
even
the
respondent
in
his
brief
openly--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
economic
result
may
be
the
same,
but
with
all
due
respect,
congress
has
not
decreed
that
the
administrative
system
work
this
way.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
hasn't
decreed
otherwise.
congress
essentially--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--congress
gave
the
fcc
power
in
276
to
come
up
with
a
plan.
but
this
case,
as
the
ninth
circuit
decided
it
is
not
under
276,
it
is
under
201,
so
the
question
is
whether
failing
to
comply
with
the
administrative
plan--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
i'm
sorry.
it
brings
us
back
to
the
question
that
you
asked:
whether
the
ninth
circuit,
or
the
fcc
for
that
matter,
can
shoehorn
this
into
201
as
an
unjust
and
unreasonable
practice.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
chief
justice
roberts,
the
fcc
was
unquestionably
acting
under
276
when
it
did
this.
so
the
question
is
whether
you
can
go
back
to
201.
and
as
i
said,
you
need
to
start
with
section
206
and
207
because
we're
in
federal
court.
and
that
says
that
violations
of
the
act
are
remediable
but
not
of
regulations,
in
contrast
to
numerous
other
sections.
so
the
question
in
asking
whether
it
violates
201,
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
simply
the
fcc's
regulation
wasn't
followed.
and
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
what
kind
of
regulation
is
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
that's
what
i
conceded
to
justice
souter
earlier.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
largely
they
are.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
this
court
can
look
several
places,
but
it
can
first
look
to
these...
this
regulatory
regime
that
was
created,
which
was
always
thought
of
as
being
triggered
by
section
276.
and
then
asking--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--in
its
order,
it
references
276
and--
201.
in
the
regulations...
i
thought
i
was
being
asked
about
the
regulations...
it
leads
with
276.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
it
wouldn't
be.
and
i
think
i
want
to
flesh
out
and
make
sure
i've
gotten
across
the
distinction
between
the
rate
making--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there
are
two
things
that
are
wrong
with
that,
justice
breyer.
the
first
thing
is
that
in
contrast
to
ordinary
rate
making
regulations,
here,
in
the
absence
of
regulations,
long
distance
providers
would
owe
pay
phone
operators
zero.
there's
no
reason
why
long
distance
providers
would
give
money
to
pay
phone
operators.
the
24
cents
here
is
to
capture
what
callers
owe
the
pay
phone
operators.
and
so
the
fcc
has
come
up
with
an
administrative
system.
but
there's
nothing
unjust
or
unreasonable
about
long
distance
providers
not
giving
money
to
pay
phone
operators
before
the
regulatory
regime
drops
into
place,
whereas
there
is
plenty
that
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
about
overcharging,
for
example--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
what
you
should
do
is
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
it
wouldn't.
justice
scalia,
i
think,
has
captained
that
position.
and
what
we're
saying
is
the
fcc
can
pick
a
fair
rate
once
it
is
something
that
long
distance
providers
or
any
common
carrier
ought
to
be
compensating
somebody
for.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is,
this
is
a
purely
administrative
creature.
and
then
it
gets
to
the
second
reason
why--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
you
would
have
been
right,
justice
breyer.
we're
not
asking...
even
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
is
another
example
of
something.
and
that
brings
me...
i
think
i
should
go
back
to
what--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--they
might.
the
question
that
we
would
ask
is
whether
it
affects
carriers'
relationships
to
their
customers.
now,
under
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
and
this
is
the
louisiana
public
service
commission--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
we're
disagreeing.
what
i
want
to
do
is
distinguish
those
from
the
case
we
have
here,
and
go
back
to
justice
souter's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is...
i
just
want
to
be
clear,
we
are
not
challenging
the
fcc's
authority
to
have
created
the
regulatory
regime
it
did
under
276.
so
the
fcc
could
well
have
picked,
as
it
did,
long
distance
providers
to
be
on
the
ultimate
hook
here.
but
the
reason...
but
the
problem
with
saying
that...
i'm
sorry.
i
lost
the
train
of
thought
in
your
question.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
than
the
one
we
have
here,
justice
souter.
the
24
cents
that
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
recoup
here,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
regulatory
system...
and
that's
what
they
are
asking
for,
is
the
24
cents
that
the
fcc
regulations
entitle
us
to...
was
calculated...
in
fact,
the
d.c.
circuit
made
the
fcc
go
through
this
exercise
three
times
to
get
it
right.
so
to
calculate
that
24
cents,
it
is
purely
a
function
of
the
amount
of
money
that
the
caller
owes
the
pay
phone
operator.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
another
way
to
perhaps
characterize
your
position
is,
why
is
this
like
a
commission
that
they
are
seeking.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
that
number
may
be
very
different
than
24
cents.
if
there
was
such
a
commission
that
could
exist,
it
would
be
far
less.
and
the
respondents
are
not
seeking
that
amount
of
money.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
so.
all
i'm
saying
is
if
you
started
with
trying
to
compensate
pay
phone
operators
for
the
service
they
provide...
that
you're
characterizing
as
the
service
they
provide
to
long
distance
carriers,
you
end
up
with
a
far
different
number.
who
knows
what
you
would
end
up
with.
probably
end
up
with
zero.
because
take
an
example
of
somebody
who
rents
a
cell
phone
for
the
weekend.
they
might
make
lots
of
long
distance
calls
on
the
cell
phone,
but
nobody
has
ever
thought
that
a
long
distance
carrier
ought
to
be
kicking
back
money,
for
example,
to
the
store
that
rented
the
cell
phone
to
the
customer
over
the
weekend.
and
i
want
to
return,
i
think
in
justice
breyer's
question--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right,
but
then
we're
back
to
the
rental
income
question,
and
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
unjust
or
unreasonable
for
long
distance
providers,
absent
the
regulations,
to
be
the
ones
paying
that
rental
income.
and
the
answer,
we
submit,
is
no.
and
the
problem
that
i
think
we've
gotten
off
on
a
couple
times
brings
us
back,
i
think,
to
the
assumption
you
asked
me
to
make
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
that
something
is
a
covered
practice
under
the
act.
and
so
another
way
to
understand
the
distinction
between
the
accounting
rules,
the
rate
making
exercises
and
all
the
rest
in
this
case
is
that
section
201(b)
of
the
act
doesn't
cover
everything
in
connection
with
a
communications
service.
it
only
covers
certain
practices
in
connection.
and
the
history,
as
well
as
the
text
and
structure,
shows
that
it
regulates
common
carriers
acting
as
such.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
we
agree
with
respondent,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
looking
at
201(b),
you
have
the
word
such
communication
practices.
and
to
understand
what
that
is
referring
to,
you
look
back
up
at
201(a)
and
see
the
universe.
now,
the
beginning
of
201(a)
is
what
we
colloquially
call
the
carrier
customer
section
of
the
act.
and
that's
the
core
of
201(b),
which
says
that
when
a
common
carrier
is
providing
service,
it
needs
to
act
justly
and
reasonably.
here...
and
with
accounting
and
rate
making
and
all
the
rest,
those
are
things
that
affect
rates
and
service
to
customers.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
something
very
different.
this
is
a
carrier-carrier
relationship.
so
you
need
to
look
somewhere
else.
and
what
respondent
says
is
you
look
to
the
end
of
201(a),
which
talks
about
physical
interconnections
between
carriers.
but
the
problem
with
that
argument,
and
the
reason
why
this
falls
outside
201(b),
even
if
it
is
somehow
unjust
and
unreasonable,
is
that
the
carrier-carrier
relationships
are
governed
only
when
the
fcc
has
ordered
physical
interconnection.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
as
we're
still
talking
generically,
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
be.
because
it
could
regulate
the
relationship
between
long
distance
providers
and
their
customers.
i
mean,
that's
the
core
of
what
201
is
about.
it's
about
how
much
they
can
charge,
what
kind
of
practices
they
can
have
in
relationship
to
their
customers.
but
here
we're
not
talking
about
a
long
distance
provider
that
is
a
common
carrier
in
relationship
to
its
customers
or
in
relation
to
its
rates
and
practices.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we
submit
it
is
a
not
a
"so
what",
justice
breyer.
because
section
201(b)
is
broad,
but
it's
not
all-encompassing.
and
congress
plenty
of
times
in
section
276,
and
in
lots
of
other
sections
of
the
communications
act,
has
responded
to
modern
necessity
by
giving
the
fcc
expanded
jurisdiction,
just
as
it
did,
as
i
said
here,
in
section
276.
but
our
core
position
here
is
that
when
congress
expands
the
fcc's
authority,
and
it
doesn't
create
a
concomitant
federal
right
of
action
along
with
it,
it
is
telling
the
fcc
to
handle
these
things
administratively,
use
its
expertise,
craft
regulations
and
enforce
them
accordingly.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
fcc
might
have
that
authority.
section
154(i),
as
well
as
other
sections
in
the
act,
give
the
commission
broad
authority
in
crafting
its
administrative
enforcement
regimes.
i
haven't
focused
on
that
exact
question,
but
it
might
well
be
able
to
say
that
in
order
to
have
this
properly
enforced,
we
need
to
have
fee
shifting.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
it
could,
and
the
fcc
could
double
fine...
the
fcc
could
do
lots
of
things.
that's
our
very
purpose,
is
that
the
fcc
ought
to
be
the
single
forum
deciding
what
kind
of
an
enforcement
mechanism
is
best,
not
leaving
it
to
federal
courts
across
the
country.
and
as
ninth
circuit
invites,
state
court
rulings
across
the
country
with
varying
rules.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
let
me
begin,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
your
question
about
whether
the
fcc
can
opine
on
remedies.
all
you
need
to
do
is
look
to
what
the
fcc
was
telling
everybody
it
was
deciding
in
these
order
proceedings.
it
was
deciding,
and
asked
for
notice
and
comment,
on
whether
psps
have
a
remedy
for
violations
of
the
pay
phone
regulations.
that
is
cited
everywhere
in
the
briefs.
it
never
asked
for
notice
and
comments,
or
considered
whether
failure
to
pay
under
the
regulations
is
a
violation
of
201(b).
so
the
question
this
court
needs
to
ask
itself
is
when
the
fcc,
by
its
own
acknowledgment,
until
now,
is
simply
opining
on
the
presence
of
a
federal
court
remedy,
whether
it
gets
deference
simply
because
it
hangs
the
hook
on
a
substantive
provision
of
the
statute.
now,
there
are
three
problems
with
what
the
fcc
has
done
in
construing
section
201.
the
first
is
that
this
is
not
a
covered
practice,
because
i
want
to
make
clear
our
position,
it's
that
the
fcc
has
plenty
of
authority
with
respect
to
carrier-customer
relationships,
but
not
with
respect
to
carrier-supplier
relationships.
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
on
unjust
and
unreasonable,
i
think
we
need
to
unpack
two
separate
questions.
one
is
whether
the
rate
the
fcc
chose
is
reasonable,
whether
the
amount
of
money
that
it
said
needs
to
be
put
into
pay
phone
operators'
pockets
is
a
fair
and
reasonable
choice.
we
have
no
dispute
about
that.
and
we
think
that
in
and
of
itself
could
generate
deference.
but
the
fcc's
determination
to
put
the
payment
obligation
on
long
distance
carriers
simply
can't
be
shoehorned
into
the
unjust
and
unreasonable
phrase
in
201(b),
because
if
that's...
the
only
reason
why
anything,
us
failing
to
pay
the
money,
would
be
because
of
the
regulations.
and
you
hear
it
again
and
again
in
their
argument,
the
fcc
having
concluded
that
long
distance
companies
are
the
ones
that
pay,
the
failure
to
pay
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
there's
no
way
to
get
there
without
the
regulations,
and
that's
what
distinguishes--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
fcc
might
have
said
that,
but
as
i
said
to
justice
souter,
that
would
be
a
very
different
proceeding
and
a
very
different
scheme
than
we
have
here,
and
a
very
different
dollar
figure
or
cent
figure
that
the
fcc
might
have
come
up
with
when
it
was
trying
to
encapsulate
that
figure,
which
we
think
is
zero,
but
under
your
reasoning
may
be
something
very
small.
but
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
two
more
things.
one
is,
on
the
jurisdictional
mismatch
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
exactly
right.
it
is
not
hard...
there
are
plenty
of
hard
things
in
this
case,
but
figuring
out
whether
a
call
is
interstate
or
intrastate
is
not
one
of
them.
all
you
need
to
know
is
where
the
call
originated
from,
and
the
number
that
was
dialed,
and
pay
phone
operators
have
that
information.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
this
is
a
pay
phone
case.
so
all
you
need
to
know
is
the
cell
phone
number
and
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
it
still
constitutes
a
long
distance
call,
depending
on
where
the
cell
phone
owner
lives.
and
that's
still
an
easy
thing
to
figure
out,
where
the
area
code
is.
finally,
justice
stevens,
you
asked
a
question
about
the
co-extensive
nature
of
the
remedies
under
206
and
208.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
statute
itself
is
co-extensive.
what
we're
saying
is
that
276
gives
the
fcc
more
than
ample
authority
to
do
what
it's
doing.
nobody
has
denied
that,
and
so
we
think
that
that's
the
place
to
look
for
the
fcc
to
craft
the
arrangement
under
southwestern
cable.
combined
with
section
154(i),
the
fcc
would
have
ample
authority
to
do
that.
