justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
administrative
remedy
that
you
just
conceded
is
a
counterpart
to
a
private
right
of
action,
or
isn't
it?
would
you
get
the
same
thing?
i
complained
to
the
agency,
and
say,
i
didn't
get...
the
pay
phone
provider
wasn't
paid,
and
x
under
the
commission's
regulations
was
supposed
to
pay
it.
so
i
complained
against
x.
could
i
get
before
the
fcc
exactly
what
i
could
get
in
court,
so
that
we're
only
talking
about
which
form
is
proper,
or
is
there
a
difference
in
the
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
before
the
agency,
you
don't
get
counsel
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
making
the
point
that
chief
judge
ginsburg
made
in
the
d.c.
circuit
that
it
is
necessarily
unjust
and
unreasonable
to
refuse
to
pay
a
charge
that
is
fair
and
reasonable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
regulations,
fcc
regulations,
the
violation
of
which
would
not
be
unfair
and
unreasonable?
