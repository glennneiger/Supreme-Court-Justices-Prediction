mr.
fisher,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
in
your
view,
did
the
regulations
create
a
legally
enforceable
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
may
that
obligation
be
enforced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
means
of
a
private
action
before
the
fcc?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
the
carrier...
where
they
would
file
a
complaint
saying
you
owe
us
x
dollars,
and
the
agency
could
order
them
to
pay
x
dollars.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
the
obligation
enforceable
in
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
view
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fisher,
can
i
go
back
to
the
first
question
i
asked
you?
would
the
fcc
have
had
authority
to
create
an
administrative
remedy
that
had
a
fee
shifting
provision
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
certainly
impose
penalties
of
some
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
on
208.
you're
saying
that
208,
like
the
earlier
provision
of
the
statute,
requires
a
violation
of
the
statute,
not
just
regulations,
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
administrative
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
same
statutory
requirement
for
the
remedy
that
your
opponent
challenges
is
the
one
he
acknowledges
is
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this.
is
it
the
same
with
respect
to
fee-shifting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
position...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
your
position
on
the
two
different
questions
that
the
chief
asked
you
is,
they
get
deference
on
question
one.
and
with
respect
to
question
two,
it
follows
from
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
sorry,
go
ahead.
