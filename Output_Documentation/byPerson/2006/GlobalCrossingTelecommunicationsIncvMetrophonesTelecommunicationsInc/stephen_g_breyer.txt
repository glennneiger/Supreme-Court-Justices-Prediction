justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
haven't.
maybe...
if
this
doesn't
clarify
it.
i
think
everyone
has
about
the
same
question.
you
have
a
bunch
of
pay
phone
operators.
and
if
the
at&t
were
charging
them
too
much,
i
think
everybody
would
say
that
the
fcc
can
say,
hey,
that's
too
much.
you
owe
them
2
cents
a
call
refund,
and
everybody
would
agree
that
the
people
who
are
hurt
could
go
into
court
and
bring
a
lawsuit
and
get
the
2
cents.
right
under
47
u.s.c.
201(b).
now,
the
only
difference
here
seems
to
be
that
it
wasn't
at&t
that
was
charging,
in
my
example,
too
much.
they
weren't
paying
what
they
owed.
they
should
have
paid
what
they
owed.
and
that,
says
the
fcc,
is,
under
201(b),
an
unreasonable
practice.
and,
therefore,
go
in
and
collect
it
in
court.
now,
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
so
far
i
have
heard
nothing
that
suggests
that
this
couldn't
be
an
unreasonable
practice
under
201(b),
which
is
just
what
the
fcc
said
it
was.
now,
what's
wrong
with
what
i
said?
i'm
simply
trying
to
focus
you
upon
what
i
think
is
the
question
that's
bothering
some
of
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
my
answer...
not
answer,
but
my
characterization
of
what
you
have
just
said
is
that
the
fcc
did
say
it
was
an
unreasonable
practice.
but
in
your
view,
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
practice
not
to
pay.
and
you
want
us
to
go
back
and
second-guess,
which
we
could,
if
their
view
of
unreasonable
practice
is
unreasonable
itself.
and
i
guess
you
would
have
to
overturn
it.
i
didn't
know
that
was
what
the
case
was
about,
but
are
you
saying
now
that
that's
the
issue?
they
said
it
was
an
unreasonable
practice
not
to
pay
this
money,
you
think
it
is
a
reasonable
practice
not
to
pay
the
money.
there
is
a
dispute.
that's
what
we
should
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
what
should
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
like
at&t
when,
in
fact...
or
any
other
utility
that,
in
fact,
runs
into
situations
every
day
of
the
week,
where
but
for
an
fcc
regulation,
they
would
not
be
overcharging,
because
they
have
a
way
of
doing
it
that
isn't
on
its
face
unjust.
but
the
fcc
writes
some
regulations
and
now
it
is
unjust.
so
i
guess
to
take
that
argument
would
overturn,
i
guess,
about
a
hundred
years
of
rate
making
law.
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
you
are
saying...
i
think
it
is
common
that
the
fcc
might
write
some
accounting
rules,
for
example.
and
they
might
say,
before
these
accounting
rules,
mr.
bell's
system
in
san
francisco,
you
could
charge
people
8
cents
a
call.
but
given
the
way
we
set
up
the
accounting
rules,
we
think
this
month
you
have
to
do
7
cents
in
the
first
six
months,
7
cents,
in
the
next
six
months,
9
cents.
and
any
deviation
from
that
is
unreasonable.
and
the
company
does
deviate.
i
would
have
always
thought
when
they
do
deviate,
they
are
behaving
unreasonably,
and
someone
who
pays
too
much
could
go
into
court
and
get
money
back.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
actually...
that's,
i
think,
your
strong...
to
me
that
was
the
strongest
argument.
when
i
finished
reading
it,
i
thought,
well,
so
what.
you
know,
i
mean,
can
you
see
why
i
thought
that?
i
mean,
today's
world
is
different.
it
is
true
that
you
don't
have
simply
a
single
telephone
company
providing
service
ultimately
directly
to
the
customer.
you
have
everything
mixed
up.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
inter-carrier
things.
language
covers
it.
purpose
covers
it.
facts
and
circumstances
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
possible...
i
was
worried
somewhat
about,
i
think,
the
problem
justice
scalia
raised,
that
old
regulations
become
unjust
and
unreasonable.
and
then
i
thought,
no,
but
tell
me
if
this
is
right.
that
they're
going
to
fall
within
201(b)
only
if
a
violation
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
now,
we
could
say,
and
moreover,
the
fcc
has
to
find
that
a
violation
of
these
regs
is
unjust
and
unreasonable,
that
is,
it
has
to
focus
on
it,
make
that
determination.
and
then,
of
course,
that
determination
has
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation.
in
other
words,
it
can't
just
call
anything
unjust
and
unreasonable--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
has
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
their
doing
so
will
create
this
private
remedy
in
the
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
that...
if
you
have
that
tough...
which
i
haven't
seen
anywhere,
but
i
mean,
if
you
had
that
tough
a
requirement,
so
they
actually
have
to
focus
on
it,
it
would
tend
to
minimize
the
problem
of
a
thousand
different
actions
in
ten
thousand
different
courts
and
a
big
mess.
but
i
mean,
how
much
is
written
into
those
words
unjust
and
unreasonable?
i'm
certain
you
can't
squeeze
any
rate...
it
is
not
the
case
that
any
and
every
regulation
can
be...
fall
within.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
is
called
global
crossing
v.
metrophones,
and
it
begins
with
telephone
deregulation
which
allowed
callers
a
choice
of
what
long
distance
carrier
they
want.
but
sometimes
they
go
a
pay-phone,
and
the
pay-phone
company
would
connect
them
not
with
the
long
distance
carrier
that
the
caller
wanted
but
with
the
company
that
the
pay-phone
operator
wanted.
well
congress
thought
that
was
a
bad
idea.
so,
they
passed
a
law
and
they
said
that
the
pay-phone
company
has
to
connect
to
however
the
caller
wants
connected
to,
whatever
carrier,
and
moreover
has
to
be
for
free,
you
don’t
have
to
put
$0.25
in
the
box.
at
that
point
the
pay-phone
company
said,
well
who
is
going
to
pay
us
for
the
call.
so
congress
passes
another
law
and
says
let
the
fcc
work
that
out,
and
the
fcc
tried
to
work
it
out
over
a
couple
of
years,
and
finally
what
they
said
was,
well
here
is
who
pays,
the
caller
connects
to
a
particular
carrier
through
the
pay-phone,
then
the
carrier
pays,
$0.24
a
call,
or
whatever
they
agree
upon
and
the
carrier
can
charge
the
ultimate
customer
with
his
long
distance
bill.
now
apparently
after
that
some
carriers
still
wouldn’t
turnover
the
$0.24
to
the
pay-phone
operator,
atleast
that’s
what
the
pay-phone
operator
will
say.
so,
the
pay-phone
operators,
some
of
them,
or
one
of
them
anyway
went
to
the
fcc,
and
the
fcc
issued
an
order
saying
that
you
have
to
pay,
and
if
you
don’t
it
is
unreasonable
practice
under
section
201(b).
later
the
pay-phone
operators
said
they
are
still
not
paying
us,
so
they
brought
a
suit
in
federal
court,
under
a
different
section
207
which
seems
linked
to
§201(b)
and
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
they
can
bring
that
suit
in
federal
court.
well
ultimately
what
we
say
it
is
ultimately
because
it
takes
a
while
to
explain
this
case,
ultimately
what
we
say
is,
well
§207
if
you
read
the
words
is
linked
to
violations
of
§201(b),
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
regulation
under
§201(b)
which
says,
when
you
don’t
pay
for
that
call,
you
don’t
pay
the
pay-phone
operator,
you
have
committed
an
unreasonable
practice
that
seems
to
us
like
a
violation
of
§201(b),
it
says
you
can
bring
the
suit
for
a
violation
of
§201(b)
its
reasonable
for
them
to
say
that,
bring
the
suit.
now,
that’s
the
opinion
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
similar
determination.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
