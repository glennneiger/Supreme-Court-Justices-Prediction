justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
made
it
that,
haven't
they,
in
a
later
regulation?
haven't
they
said
just
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
later
order,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
rate
making
regulations
issued
under
201,
do
they
purport
to
be
the
fcc's
definition
of
what
is
just
and
reasonable
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
issued
under
201.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
are
an
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
in
201.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
this
one
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
would
be
a
reasonable
practice
not
to
pay
the
money,
but
for
the
existence
of
the
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
back,
let's
hear
about
the
accounting
rules.
what
would
they
be
issued
under?
would
they
be
issued
under
201?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
accounting
rules...
in
order
to
decide
what
is
just
and
reasonable,
you
have
to
have
accounting
rules.
so
the
accounting
rules
fit
very
comfortably
under
201.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
can't...
what
can't
be--
sucked
in
under
section
201?
i
mean,
once
the
fcc
issues
a
regulation,
it's
easy
to
say
that
any
violation
of
that
regulation
is
unjust.
and
that's
what's
happened
here.
and
this
just
makes
a
farce
of
the
provision
that
says
the
only
private
causes
of
action
are
for
violations
of
the
statute
and
not
for
violations
of
the
regulation.
it
seems
to
me
if
this
thing,
276,
can
get
sucked
into
201
simply
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
failing
to
obey
an
fcc
regulation
is
unjust,
that
provision
is
a
nullity.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
you'd
have
to
argue
that
if
the
theory
you're
propounding
for
this
case
is
correct.
violation
of
an
fcc
regulation
is
unjust.
failing
to
comply
with
an
fcc
regulation
is
unjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
can...
every
fcc
regulation
can
be
enforceable
by
private
action?
all
the
fcc
has
to
say
is
that
violation
of
this
regulation
is
unjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least...
at
least
any
fcc
regulations
relating
to
charges,
practices...
and
you
want
to
interpret
practices
very
broadly...
classifications,
and
regulations
for
and
in
connection
with
communication
service,
all
of
those
regulations
can
be
sued
upon
in
federal
court
with
all
the
diverse
and
contradictory
rulings
that
that
will
produce,
so
long
as
the
fcc
says
that
the
failure
to
obey
this
regulation
is,
in
our
view,
unjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
he's
saying
that.
i
don't
think
he's
saying
that
if
it
is
covered
under
regulation,
it
can't
be
unjust.
some
regulations
do
relate
to
justness
and
reasonableness,
but
not
276.
i
think
what
he's
saying
is
276
established
a
scheme.
it
didn't
have
to
be
this
scheme.
it
could
have
been
some
other
scheme.
nothing
in
the
nature
of
things
says
that
the
long
distance
carrier
has
to
be
the
one
liable
for
this.
it
rather
was
simply
imposed
by
the
fcc.
that's
fine.
but
to
say
that
it
would
be
unjust
for
them
not
to
do
that
is
just
unreal,
unless
you're
going
to
allow
any
violation
of
any
fcc
regulation
to
be
unjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
rate
regulation
is...
is
established
in
order
to
determine
what
reasonableness
and
justness
requires.
and
276
is
something
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
wait.
wait.
it
says
to
furnish
such
communications
service,
is
what
(a)
says.
and
they
don't
furnish
such
communications
service
to
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
such
communications
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
think
that
would
mean
such
communications
service
that
was
furnished.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
that
it
is
none
of
their
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
should
be
arguing,
then,
that
we
should
give
chevron
deference
to
the
commission's
interpretation
of
section
208.
and
once
we
do
that,
if
208
governs
this
thing,
then
so
does
206.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
should
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they're
certainly
entitled
to
deference
as
to
whether
an
administrative
action
can
be
brought
under
208.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
say
that
it
can,
then
a
court
action
can
be
brought
under
206.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
we
don't
owe
them
deference
for
206,
but
we
do
for
208.
and
if
you
give
deference
for
208,
206
automatically
decides
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
depending
upon
how
broadly
you
think
congress
intends
regulations
to
be
sucked
into
the
terms
of
this
statute.
i
mean,
your
interpretation
means
sandoval
really
didn't
say
a
heck
of
a
lot.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you
could
say
any
violation
of
a
regulation
is
unjust.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
sandoval
doesn't
mean
a
heck
of
a
lot.
all
the
fcc
has
to
say
is,
we
think
violation
of
this
regulation
is
unjust.
