mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
not
particularly
unusual
for
the
grants
of
authority
in
the
fcc...
to
the
fcc
throughout
the
communications
act
to
be
enforceable
through
the
provisions
of
section
201(b)
barring
unjust
or
unreasonable
charges,
classifications,
rates,
or
practices.
justice
scalia
asked
a
question
during
mr.
fisher's
argument
about,
what
about
the
accounting
rules?
would
they
be
prescribed
under
section
201?
they
would
be
prescribed
under
section
220,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
that
governs
accounting.
and
they
would
also
be
prescribed
under
the
last
sentence
of
section
201,
which
is
the
general
authority
given
to
the
fcc
to
promulgate
all
of
its
rules.
but
nothing
in
those
facts
would
keep
a
violation
of
those
rules
from
being
enforced
as
an
unjust
or
unreasonable
practice
under
section
201(b).
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
fcc
has
never
argued,
and
we
have
never
argued
that
all
fcc
regulations
are
enforceable
through
a
private
right
of
action.
i
mean,
to
give
an
example,
as--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
no,
your
honor.
the
phrase
unjust
or
unreasonable
is
a
classic
phrase
delegating
to
the
administrative
agency
the
authority
to
make
the
determinations
in
the
first
instance
of
what's
just
and
reasonable.
if,
for
example,
there
were
a
violation
of
the
regulation
forbidding
giving
credits
to
political
candidates,
the
fcc
could
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
the
violation
of
that
regulation
rises
to
the
order
of
unjust
or
unreasonable.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
are
also
examples
of
things
that
fall
outside
of
charges,
classification,
rates
or
practices.
there
are
examples
in
the
case
law.
there
are
old
icc
cases
in
which
providing
a
particular
type
of
boxcar
was
deemed
not
to
be
a
charge,
classification,
rate...
held
not
to
be
a
charge,
classification,
rate
or
practice.
there
is
a
recent
d.c.
circuit
case
involving
an
attempt
to
dictate,
in
the
ferc
context,
to
an
energy
company
who
can
be
on
its
board
of
directors.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
let's
start
with
statutory
text.
section
206
says
that
there
is
a
damages
action
for
anything
in
this
act
declared
to
be
unlawful.
section
201(b)
says
unjust
or
unreasonable
classifications,
practices,
et
cetera,
are
declared
to
be
unlawful.
so
we
have
a
very
precise
match
in
statutory
text
between
201(b)
and
206.
now,
what
mr.
fisher's
argument
amounts
to
is
to
say
that
if
it
is
covered
in
a
regulation,
it
is
exempted
from
being
called
an
unjust
or
unreasonable
charge,
classification,
practice,
et
cetera,
because
that
would
allow
the
fcc
to
enforce
too
much.
but
if
we
start
with
the
text
congress
enacted,
there
is
a
precise
match
between
201(b)
and
206.
and
to
say
that
that
which
the
fcc
hasn't
regulated
is
more
subject
to
judicial
review--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
our
position
doesn't
require
us
to
argue
that
it
would
have
been
unjust
for
the
fcc
to
adopt
some
other
scheme.
our
position
is
that
once
the
scheme
is
in
place,
it
is
unjust
to
depart
from
that
scheme
in
the
way
global
crossing
did,
just
as
once
a
scheme
of
rate
regulation
is
in
place,
even
though
there
could
be
many
different
schemes
of
rate
regulation,
it
may
be
unjust
or
unreasonable
to
charge
a
higher
rate
than
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
276
is,
asks...
was
a
delegation
by
congress
to
the
agency
to
fill
in
the
details
of
a
plan
to
make
sure
that
pay
phone
service
providers
were
fairly
compensated,
a
phrase
not
very
different
from
just
and
reasonable,
for
each
and
every
completed
interstate
and
intrastate
pay
phone
call.
they
really
fit
quite
nicely
together
as
opposed
to
being
in
tension
with
one
another.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
right.
the
usual--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
that's
right.
the
usual
chevron
limitations
apply.
and
in
your
question,
justice
breyer,
you
added
to
the
usual
chevron
limitations
that
the
fcc
has
to
focus
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
that's
fine.
here
the
fcc
did
focus
on
it
and
is
criticized
for
having
focused
on
the
consequences
for
judicial
action.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
address
the
interplay
between
201(b)
and
201(a),
because
mr.
fisher
has
simply
misunderstood
our
position.
we
cited
the
second
half
of
section
201(a)
not
to
say
it
applies
of
its
own
force
here,
but
to
say
that
it
disproves
the
contention
that
the
communications
services
referred
to
in
the
phrase
such
communications
service
in
201(b)
have
to
be
limited
to
carrier-customer
relations,
because
201(a)
isn't
limited
to
carrier-customer
relations.
yes,
all
201(a)
does
of
its
own
force
is
allow
the
prescribing
of
through
routes
and
interconnections.
but
there
is
no
possible
way
to
read
201(b)
as
limited
to
carrier-carrier
communications
in
light
of
the
full
breadth
of
practices
covered
by
201(b).
so
that's
the
reason
to
cite
201(a)
is
simply
to
disprove
mr.
fisher's
contention
about
the
limits
on
201(b).
the
phrase
such
communications
service
is
actually
used
in
201(a)
and
in
201(b),
and
the
antecedent
in
the
first
few
words
of
201(a),
the
such
communications
service,
is
interstate
or
foreign
communication
by
wire
or
radio.
so
201(b)
isn't
necessarily
restricted
to
either
carrier-carrier
or
carrier-customer
relations,
but
such
communication
service
relates
back
to
all
communication
by
wire
or
radio,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
but...
well,
that's
debatable,
but
what
201(b)
refers
to,
in
any
event,
is
in
connection
with--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--right.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
they
have
furnished
a
communications
service
to
a
customer,
not
to
us,
but
to
a
customer.
so
again,
this
is
connected
with
that
communications
service.
and
as
the
colloquy
with
justice
souter
earlier
touched
on,
the
caller
pays
sooner
or
later.
under
the
fcc's
regulatory
scheme,
and
in
part
because
of
the
prohibition
on
advanced
caller
payment
in
226(e)(2),
what
happens
is
the
long
distance
carrier
gets
the
money,
and
they're
saying
there's
no
private
right
of
action
to
make
them
give
it
back.
in
other
words,
the
world
would
look
quite
different
without
a
regulatory
scheme,
but
it
would
not
be
a
regulatory
scheme
in
which
they
get
all
the
money
they
are
currently
purporting
to
keep.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
also
asked
a
question
about
the
flash
point
on
whether
the
fcc
was
improperly
or
suspiciously
commenting
on
the
scope
of
the
private
right
of
action
as
opposed
to
interpreting
a
substantive
provision.
the
private
right
of
action
provisions
are
206
through
208,
the
provisions
that
let
the
complainant
go
to
either
court
or
the
commission.
the
fcc
said
nothing
controversial
about
the
scope
of
206
through
208.
the
controversy
is
over
the
scope
of
201(b),
which
is
a
substantive
provision.
but
once
you
have
something
brought
within
the
scope
of
201(b),
after
the
application
of
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction
with
chevron
deference,
the
private
right
of
action
follows
automatically
under
206
and
207.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
fcc
reaching
out
to
say,
we
are
going
to
create
a
private
right
of
action.
it
is
a
matter
of
the
fcc
construing
a
substantive
term
with
consequences
for
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
it
may
not
be
particularly
helpful,
but
it
is
surely
not
particularly
harmful.
and
they
did
have
a
reason--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--if
they
were
trying
to
construe--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--206
through
208,
your
honor,
i
might
agree.
but
they
construed
201(b)
and
commented
on
the
consequence.
and
this
is
quite
important,
that
it
is
their
business,
because
208
is
the
provision
under
which
each
and
every
one
of
those
commission
proceedings
cited
in
the
sprint
brief,
which
mr.
fisher
alluded
to,
has
proceeded
before
the
agency.
208,
just
like
206,
requires
a
violation
of
the
act,
so
it
is
very
much
their
business
to
decide
whether
these
pay
phone
controversies
state
violations
of
the
act.
if
they
don't,
the
commission
has
absolutely
no
power
to
proceed
under
208,
which
is
the
only
provision
under
which
any
administrative
proceeding
has
ever
gone
forward.
there
are
some
arguments
made
here
that
they
clearly
have
the
authority
to
proceed
administratively
even
if
you
can't
go
to
court,
but
mr.
fisher
hasn't
identified
the
source
of
that
authority.
and
the
sources
identified
in
the
brief
are
section
4(i),
which
has
been
problematic,
and
others...
and
other
sections
on
which
the
fcc
has
never
relied
on
in
this
setting,
and
some
kind
of
divination
of
an
action
within
section
276
itself.
the
question
was
put
at
one
point
to
mr.
fisher,
could
the
fcc
mandate
fee-shifting
as
part
of
this
administrative
remedy
it's
going
to
create.
well,
if
you
read
276
broadly,
it's
giving
the
commission
great
powers
to
create
administrative
remedies,
notwithstanding
208,
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
administrative
provision,
then
maybe
anything
goes.
but
we're
getting
awfully
far
from
the
statute
that
congress
wrote
and
giving
the
fcc
awfully
expansive
powers
to
construe
276,
while
also
denying
the
fcc
rather
mundane
powers
to
construe
rather
ordinary
phrases
of
administrative
law,
201(b).
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
a
practice
in
connection
with
a
communications
service,
mr.
fisher
argues
strenuously
that
it
is
not.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
section
207
expressly
gives
the
complainant
a
choice
of
forums.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
in
fact,
global
crossing...
global
crossing
went
so
far
as
to
argue
before
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
is
no
administrative
remedy,
that
there's
simply
nothing
to
do
except
get
fines
under
sections
502
and
503,
and
has
reversed
its
position
before
this
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
happy
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
question
whether
practices
are
limited
to
carrier-customer
relations,
i've
already
touched
on
that
by
talking
about
the
interplay
between
201(a)
and
201(b).
but
there's
another
angle
of
approach
for
that
issue,
which
is
that
in
the
louisiana
service...
louisiana
public
service
commission
case,
this
court
was
asked
to
draw
the
inference,
just
as
it
has
been
in
this
court,
from
other
provisions
in
the
communications
act,
that
those
phrases
always
refer
to
carrier-customer
relations.
and
the
court
said,
no,
that
phrase
can
also
refer
to
depreciation
rules,
so
it's
not
limited
to
carrier-customer
relations,
the
inference
from
other
provisions
of
the
act
doesn't
flow.
and
the
reason
is
there
are
words
of
limitation
when
those
words,
"charges,
classifications,
rates
or
practices.
"
are
used
in
those
other
sections
that
make
it
clear
that
they
apply
only
to
tariffed
services.
you
find
no
such
words
of
limitation
in
201(a)
and
201(b)...
or
in
201(b),
excuse
me.
now,
there
remains
the
argument
that
there's
a
mismatch
between
section
201
and
the
relevant
regulations
because
the
regulations
apply
to
intrastate
as
well
as
interstate
calls,
and
section
201
applies
to
interstate
or
foreign
communications.
that
argument
appears
for
the
very
first
time
in
merits
briefing
in
this
court.
it
wasn't
made
below.
it
wasn't
made
in
the
cert
petition.
it
wasn't
made
to
the
agency.
and
that's
a
problem,
because
the
limits
of
the
fcc's
ability
to
regulate
jurisdictionally
mixed
communications
depend
on
factual
determinations,
factual
determinations
neither
the
agency
nor
even
the
lower
courts
have
ever
been
given
a
chance
to
make.
but
had
this
issue
been
raised
in
a
timely
fashion,
i
suggest
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
the
fcc
to
reach
intrastate
as
well
as
interstate
communications
because
long
distance...
dial-around
calls
are
overwhelmingly
long
distance,
overwhelmingly
interstate,
and
it
is
difficult
to
sort
out
which
calls
are
which.
in
fact,
the
seven
years
of
rulemaking
the
fcc
underwent
in
this
case
largely
were
because
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
track
of
particular
pay
phone
calls.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sorting
one
call
from
one
carrier
that
has
a
relationship
with
you
is
not
difficult,
or
sorting
100
calls
from
a
carrier
that
has
a
relationship
with
you
is
not
difficult.
but
when
you
go
from
a
psp
to
an
inter-exchange
carrier
to
a
switch-based
reseller,
matching
up
the
information
of
all
three
is...
has
proven,
in
practice,
to
be
quite
difficult.
and
it's
especially
difficult
in
an
era
in
which
you
can't
just
tell
by
area
codes,
for
example,
whether
something
is
interstate.
if
i
dial
202
to
202,
i
may
be
dialing
someone's
cell
phone
out
of
state.
now,
the
judgment
below
could
be
explained
on
the
alternative
ground
that
a
violation
of
the
regulations
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
276.
before
i
even
get
to
the
substantive
discussion,
let
me
respond
to
the
absolutely
groundless
claim
that
that
argument
has
been
abandoned.
global
crossing
cites
a
bunch
of
cases
involving
section
1291
appeals
in
which
people
didn't
appeal
a
particular
order
after
final
judgment,
and
says
that's
an
abandonment
of
the
claim.
that's
both
correct
and
irrelevant.
this
is
a
1292(b)
appeal
and
there
is
no
final
judgment
on
any
claim
in
this
case,
certainly
not
on
the
276
claim,
so
my
client
certainly
hasn't
abandoned
it.
my
client
was
also
a
party
to
greene
and
lost
greene
and
has
argued
the
merits
of
the
section
276
position
all
along.
on
the
merits,
section
276
contains
rights-creating
language
that
creates
a
concrete
monetary
entitlement,
focuses
on
the
party
benefitted,
and
does
not
have
an
aggregate
focus.
global
closing
doesn't
even
try
to
defend
the
ninth
and
d.c.
circuits'
reasoning
that
the
statute
does
not
contain
rights-creating
language.
that
leaves
the
tricky
question
whether
a
violation
of
the
regs
can
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
act
itself
when
congress
specified
only
the
right,
but
didn't
specify
what
fair
compensation
was,
and
didn't
specify
who
had
to
pay
the
compensation.
in
that
respect,
i
think
alexander
v.
sandoval,
though
it's
been
cited
against
us
repeatedly,
is
actually
helpful
to
our
position.
that
case
says
it's
meaningless
talk
about
a
violation
of
the
regs
separate
from
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
that
a
congress
that
intends
an
act
to
be
enforced
intends
the
regulations
filling
out
the
act
to
be
enforced.
i
think
the
theory
of
chevron
itself
is
also
helpful
to
our
position
in
this
regard,
because
the
point
of
chevron
is
that
the
use
of
broad
language
constitutes
an
administrative...
a
delegation
of
authority
to
the
administrative
agency,
not
just
to
fill
in
details,
but
to
give
definitive
content
to
a
statute
whose
direct
content
is
less
than
definitive.
so
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
talk
about
this
statute,
section
276,
and
its
rights-creating
language
as
ordering
the
fcc
not
just
to
create
a
plan,
but
ordering
the
fcc
to
create
a
plan
that
has
a
particular
goal
such
that
violation
of
that
goal
can
be
deemed
a
violation
of
section
276
itself.
thank
you.
