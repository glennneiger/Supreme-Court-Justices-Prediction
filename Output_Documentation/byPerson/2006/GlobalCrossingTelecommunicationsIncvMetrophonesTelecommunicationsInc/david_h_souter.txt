justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
fisher,
i
realize
you
don't
concede,
in
fact,
quite
to
the
contrary,
you
deny
that
the
failure
to
pay
the
full
rate
is...
could
be
considered
a
practice
here.
but
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
is
a
practice
within
the
meaning
of
the
text.
if
the...
if
the
agency
had
explicitly
said,
what
we
are
doing
here
in
defining
this
practice
as
unlawful
or
unjust,
is
to
define
it
as
such
within
the
meaning
of,
what
is
it,
201(b),
so
they
make
explicit
reference
to
the
statute
and
they
say,
we
are
fleshing
out
the
statute,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wasn't
textually
as
nice
as
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
in
the
reg
itself,
they
were
that
precise.
would
your
position
be
exactly
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
invite
me
to
change
the
hypothetical,
then,
by
jacking
it
up
in
this
respect.
the
fcc
gives
the
reason.
and
it
says,
the
reason
it's
unjust
and
unreasonable
is
that
the
carriers
are
getting
a
free
ride
on
the
pay
phones,
et
cetera.
so
they
fill
in
the
gap
that
you
claim.
they
have
a
reason.
would
your
answer
or
your
position
still
be
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
there
any
times
under
any
circumstances
that
you
can
think
of
in
which
the
fcc
can
adequately
and
validly
define
a
practice
as
unjust
and
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
so
that,
in
fact,
in
applying
the
statute,
we
would
follow...
be
bound
to
follow
the
regs?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
why
can't
they
pass
a
regulation
that
says
don't
gouge
pay
phone
operators?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
they?
i
mean,
the
statute
of
the
united
states
says
that...
i
think
i'm
correct...
the
statute
of
the
united
states
says
they
can't
be
required,
the
caller
cannot
be
required
to
put
in
the
quarter
in
order
to
get
the
800
number
and
so
on.
so
as
a
matter
of
law,
don't
we
have
to
say
that
the,
in
practical
terms,
the
caller
doesn't
owe?
somebody
owes.
somebody
ought
to
pay
for
the
use
of
this
facility.
but
congress
has
said
it
is
not
the
end
user.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
customer
is
going
to
pay
if,
in
fact,
the
long
distance
carrier
is
the
one
who
has
to
make
the
immediate
payment,
because
that
payment
is
going
to
be
figured
in
the
long
distance
rate.
so
that
ultimately,
the
end
user
is
going
to
pay
for
the
service
he
gets,
and
congress
is
simply
saying,
the
way
to
make
this
thing
work
in
a
sensible
and
simple
way
is
to
require
the
long
distance
carrier
to
make
the
reimbursement.
the
economic
end
result
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
if
they
had
said,
well,
you
can
send
a
bill
for
25
cents
to
the
end
user.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
hasn't
decreed
otherwise.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
classic
situation
in
which
agencies
are
supposed
to
figure
out
what
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand
it,
it
came
to
the
conclusion
not
that
they
were
not
acting
under
276,
but
that,
in
fact,
the
cause
of
action
has
to
refer
back
to
201.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
focus
your
return
to
me?
because
i
want
to
take
up
with
where
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
left
off.
as
i
understand
it,
you
were
saying
that
the
rate
in
this
case
is
unreasonable
because
the
party
or
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
use
of
the
pay
phone
facilities
is
the
person
who's
making
the
call,
not
the
long
distance
carrier.
my
question
to
you
is,
isn't
that
simply
a
choice
of
characterization?
because
another
way
of
looking
at
it
would
be
that
the
person
who
makes
the
call
wants
to
use
long
distance
facilities
to
get
to
the
person
he
wants
to
talk
to.
and,
therefore,
the
long
distance
facility
in
every
pay
phone
case
is
using
the
pay
phone
in
order
to
get
the
customer
to
what
the
long
distance
facility
provides.
why
then
isn't
it
just
as
fair
to
characterize
the
use
of
the
pay
phone
here
as
for
the
benefit
of
the
carrier
as
for
the
benefit
of
the
customer?
and
if
that
is
just
as
fair,
doesn't
that
end
the
distinction
that
you
drew
with
justice
scalia
saying
that
it
is
not
fair
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
is
simply,
you
can
say...
one
way
of
looking
at
this
transaction
is,
it
is
the
guy
making
the
call
who's
using
it.
another
way
is
to
say
the
long
distance
facilities
carrier
is
using
it
to
get
the
call
to
the
long
distance
facility.
if
you
look
at
it
in
way
b,
doesn't
your
argument
for
unreasonableness
disappear?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
difference
does
that
make?
the
use
of
the
phone
is
of
a
value
of
24
cents.
but
the
value
of
using
the
phone
is
a
value
not
only
to
the
caller,
but
to
the
long
distance
provider
who
couldn't
provide
anything
to
the
caller
without
the
pay
phone?
why
isn't
the
alternative
characterization
just
as
easy,
regardless
of
how
they
get
to
24
cents?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
but
aren't
you
arguing
with
the
24
cents,
as
opposed
to
creating
an
argument
about
what
is
the
proper
characterization
of
the
transaction?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason
is
that
the
store
that
rents
the
cell
phone
is
getting
rental
income
from
the
cell
phone.
and
in
the
case
of
the
pay
phone,
the
pay
phone
operator
is
going
to
get
zero,
unless
there
is
some
such
scheme
as
this.
