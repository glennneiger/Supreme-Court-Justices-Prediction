mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
drug-trafficking
crime
is
defined
in
18
u.s.
code
section
924(c)
as
any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
or
two
other
federal
statutes.
"punishable"
is
a
key
term.
if
that
word
is
omitted,
the
remaining
phrase,
"any
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
clearly
refers
to
felony
violations
of
the
controlled
substances
act.
the
parties
agree
that
"punishable"
means
"subject
to
criminal
sanctions".
so,
a
924(c),
is
conduct
that
is
subject
to
being
punished
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
state
felonies
are
not,
themselves,
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
it
is
not
a
federal
crime
to
violate
state
law.
the
defendant's
conduct
may
be
punishable
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
but
a
state
felony
is
not
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
our
position
is,
if
the
conduct
would
violate
a
felony
provision
of
the
controlled
substances
act
or
one
of
the
other
two
federal
statutes,
it
then
is
a
drug-trafficking
crime
under
18
u.s.
code
section
924(c),
and,
therefore,
it
is
an
aggravated
felony.
but
there
are
three
additional
textual
indications,
in
addition
to
simply
the
924(c).
the
first
one
is,
there
are
other
provisions
of
section
924...
(e),
(g),
and
(k)...
where
congress
actually
used
very
similar
language.
it
referred
to
conduct
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
or
the
two
other
statutes,
or
offenses
under
the
controlled
substances
act
or
the
two
other
federal
statutes.
but
then,
it
added
an
express
reference
to
state
offenses,
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
implication
is
that
when
congress
meant
to
include
state
offenses,
it
said
so.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the...
you
can
find
them;
they're
in
the
appendix
to
lopez's
blue
brief,
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
the
provisions
on
(e),
(g),
and
(k)...
924
begins
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix,
and
(e)
begins
on
5a,
and
you
can
pick
up...
(g)
is
on
6a,
(k)
is
on
7a.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
they're
subsections
(e),
(g),
and
(k).
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it
is
a
bit
broader,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
if
you
look
at
all
of
these
provisions,
the
implication
is
clearly
that
congress
was
referring
to
state
law
when
it
meant
to
include
state
law.
i
mean,
the...
if
you
looked
at
(e),
for
example,
there
it's
a
parallel
construction;
it's
not
broader.
i
think
perhaps
the
government
would
say,
"well,
we're
talking
about
offenses.
"
that's
a
little
different
from
a
felony,
but
"offenses"
is
actually
a
broader
term.
i'll
mention
an
additional
statute,
which
was
not
in
the
appendix...
18
u.s.
code
section
3559(c)(2)(h).
this
provision...
it's
a
similar
provision;
it
defines
a
csa.
an
additional
textual
indication
is,
it's
agreed...
and
this
court
has
already
said,
in
gonzales
against
the
united
states,
that
a
drug-trafficking
crime
under
924(c),
under
the
criminal
statute,
must
be
a
federal
crime.
924(c)(1)(a)
refers
to
a
crime
that
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states,
and
that
clearly
refers
to
a
federal
crime.
the
definition
of
drug-trafficking
crime,
by
its
term,
says
it
is
for
purposes
of
924(c),
so
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
include
state
felonies
in
a
definition
that
applies
to
a
federal
criminal
provision
that
all
concede
applies
only
to
federal
predicate
offenses.
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
government's
interpretation
would
significantly
broaden
section
924(c)
to
include
federal
misdemeanors.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
justice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--justice
alito,
in
our
view,
"illicit
trafficking"
means
any
offense
that
has
a
trafficking
element...
that
is,
distribution,
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
manufacture--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
they're...
most
offenses
under
the
controlled
substances
act
are
trafficking
offenses.
there
are
a
few
that
are
simple
possession.
there
is
a
date-rape
drug
that
i
will
not
try
to
pronounce,
but
it's
listed
in
21
u.s.c.
section--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--844.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
believe
the
government
has
a
footnote
in
their
brief
where
they
suggest
there
are
some
state
trafficking
offenses
that
actually
do
not
have
a
parallel
in
federal
law.
soliciting,
i
think,
may
be
one
of
them.
so,
i
think
there
are,
in
fact,
some.
and
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
by
adding
illicit
trafficking...
any
trafficking
offense,
state
or
federal,
whether
or
not
it
is
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
is
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the...
justice
alito,
there
is
an
argument...
it's
developed
in
the
brief
of
the
american
bar
association...
that,
because
illicit
trafficking
is
the
general
category,
that
all
the
aggravated
felonies
in
this
category
should
have
a
trafficking
component;
and,
therefore,
the
felonies
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
that
are
"simple
possession"
offenses
should
not,
in
fact,
be
included.
that
is
not
an
argument
that
we
have
pressed
in
our
brief.
we
read
the
phrase
to
say
"illicit
trafficking,
including
any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
so,
i
would
agree
with
you,
to
the
extent
that
if
it
is
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
congress
has
said,
by
definition,
that
it
is
included
in
the
category
of
illicit
trafficking.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
justice
breyer,
it
is
a
misdemeanor
under--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
controlled--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but,
you
know--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
you
could
look
to
the
case
of
jerome
against
united
states,
which
is...
which
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court...
in
which
the
court
held
that
the...
just
the
phrase
"any
felony"--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--in
the
federal
bankruptcy
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
any
federal
felony,
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but,
i
mean,
the
government--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--accuses
us--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
government
accuses
us
of
making
that
concession--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
we--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--really
don't.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
really
don't.
i
mean,
we
concede
that
if
the...
i
mean,
8--
924(c),
the
criminal
statute,
says
nothing
about
state
law.
it
says
nothing
about
any
conviction
under
federal
or
state
law.
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
conduct
is
punishable,
capable
of
being
punished,
under
the
controlled
substances
act--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
i...
but
i
just
want
to
be
careful
about
the
language
in
which
we
make--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--this
concession--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
if
it's
ambiguous,
and
you
look
to
the
legislative
history,
i
think
we
get
considerable
mileage
from
barrett.
the
congress
was
pretty
clear
that
what
it
was
doing
was
codifying
barrett.
the
barrett
approach,
which
was
then
followed
by
the
bia
for
more
than
a
decade,
was
that
they
would
count
state
drug
crimes,
but
only
if
they
were
felonies
under
the
federal
statutes,
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
so,
i
think
we
get
considerable
mileage
out
of
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
don't
see
any
tension.
gonzales
was
just
about
consecutive
versus
concurrent
sentences
under
state
versus
federal
law.
i
mean,
the
court
has
applied
that
principle--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--for
example,
in
taylor--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but...
i
mean,
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
see
how
it
limits
it.
and
there
have
been
other
cases...
taylor
is
an
example...
where
the
court
adopted
a
single
definition
of
924(e).
that
applies
the
jerome
principle.
i
mean,
it's
a
principle
that
has
been
applied
in
a
number
of
this
court's
cases.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--when
we
get
to
that
language,
mr.
chief
justice...
and
i
do
think
it
helps
the
analysis
to
first
decide,
what
is
the
definition
of
a
924(c),
the
criminal
statute?
once
you've
decided
that...
now,
when
you
move
back
to
the
ina,
there
is
this
language.
the
term
101(a)(43),
whether
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
law,
or
the
law
of
a
foreign
country.
now,
we
think
that's
pretty
straightforward.
it
has
to
be
an
offense
described.
so,
the
simple
example
is
money
laundering.
it...
the
offense
described
in
18
u.s.
code
section
1956,
"money
laundering",
is
an
aggravated
felony.
so,
a
violation
of
state
law
or
of
foreign
law
can
be
an
aggravated
felony,
but
only
if
it
is
the
offense
described
in
1956.
if
states
or
a
foreign
government
has
a
broader
definition
of
"money
laundering",
that
can't
count,
because
it's
not
the
offense
described.
and
when
you
turn
to
a
drug-trafficking
crime,
the
way
that
offense
is
described
in
101(a)(43)
is...
congress
picked
up,
in
its
entirety
and
without
any
modification,
the
definition
of
924(c),
a
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
so,
if
you
agree
that,
in
the
criminal
statute,
that
means
a
felony
violation
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
the
offense
described
is
the
felonies
in
the
controlled
substances
act,
not
the
felonies
in
the
misdemeanors.
and
state...
if
state
law
wants
to
call
a...
something
that's
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law
a
felony,
they
can
do
that,
but
they
can't
expand
the
offense
described.
the
offense
described,
the
way
congress
did
that,
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
i'm
focusing
on
the
definition
of
"drug-trafficking
crime".
it...
also,
there's
the
illicit
trafficking
piece
of
this.
and,
i
should
add,
any
state
offense
that
is
illicit
trafficking
is
going
to
be
an
aggravated
felony.
we
recognize
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
mr.
kneedler
said
that
a
federal
misdemeanor
is
a
drug...
trafficking
crime
under
section
924(c)
if
a
state
punishes
it
as
a
felony.
he
said,
"well,
the
federal
government
never
prosecutes
federal
misdemeanors
under
section
924(c).
"
"the
reason
is
because
of
924(c)(1)(a).
"
and
the
language
there
is,
it
has
to
be
an
offense
for
which
the
person
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states.
but
that
language...
a
person
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
for
a
misdemeanor.
so,
the
government
is
making
an
argument
that,
to
my
knowledge,
has
never
been
accepted
by
any
court,
has
not
ever
been
advanced
by
the
government
in
a
criminal
context,
and
that
would
significantly
expand
section
924(c)
and
numerous
other
criminal
statutes
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
used
the
same
definition
of
"drug-trafficking
crime".
the...
mr.
kneedler
also
said
that
the
aggravated
felony
provisions
in
section
101(a)(43)
refer
to
state
law,
but
i
read
them
just
the
opposite.
there
are
two
kinds.
there
are
21
of
them.
many
of
them
say,
"an
offense
described
in
18
u.s.
code
section
x..
"
i
mean,
that's
really
what...
we're
dealing
with
one
of
those
here.
so,
it
clearly
goes
to
federal
law
to
define
the
offense.
now,
if
state
law
or
foreign
law
also
punishes
that
offense,
then
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
but,
clearly,
federal
law
is
defining
the
offense.
there
are
other
categories,
such
as
murder
and
theft,
that
are
defined,
in
general
terms;
but
the
government's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
again,
you
use
a
generic
uniform
definition.
you
don't
pick
any
definition
that
the
states
may
have.
the
court
just
granted--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
yes--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
again,
to
be
clear...
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
the
government's
position
in
other
cases...
ultimately,
there
will
be
some
uniform
federal
definition
of
what
constitutes
illicit
trafficking.
it
would
be...
some
commercial
element
would
probably
be
the
definition
the
court
hasn't
decided.
states
can
define
it
more
broadly.
but
the
actual
definition...
just
as
the
definition
of
"burglary"
or
"theft"--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it's...
i
mean,
as...
this...
in
the
taylor
case,
in
burglary,
the
court
has
a
methodology
for
this.
you
pick
a
sort
of
generic
definition.
it
may
not...
it
may
not
come
from
a
federal
statute;
it
could--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it's...
again,
this
is...
the
provision
we're
dealing
with
is...
looks
to
federal
law,
the
controlled
substances
act
and
two
other
statutes.
my
understanding
of
the
government's
position...
and
it's
consistent
with
this
court's
cases,
in
taylor...
is
that,
even
when
it's
a
generic
offense,
you
would...
you
would
still
have
a
uniform
definition.
and
that
is
certainly
consistent
with
the
principle
of
uniformity
that
applies
both
in
criminal
law
and
in
immigration
law.
i
mean,
if
there's
any
ambiguity,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
ambiguities
are
supposed
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
uniformity,
uniform
federal
law...
uniform
federal
criminal
law,
and
uniform
immigration
law.
effectively,
what
the
government
is
arguing
that...
is
that
states
can
banish
noncitizens,
and
can
do
so
by
enacting
drug
laws,
deciding
to
make
a
simple
possession
offense
a
felony.
that's
a
decision
that
a
state
would
make,
almost
certainly,
for
reasons
that
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
immigration,
and
it's
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
left
that
determination
to
states.
on
uniformity,
aggravated
felonies
is
a
condition
for
citizenship.
if
you're
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony,
you
may
not
become
a
u.s.
citizen.
you
are
foreclosed
from
establishing
good
moral
character.
so,
in
fact,
citizenship
is
at
stake
here,
and
the
uniformity
clause
is
in
play.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
