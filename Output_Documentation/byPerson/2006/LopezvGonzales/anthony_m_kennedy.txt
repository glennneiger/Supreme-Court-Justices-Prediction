well,
do
you
agree
that
if
there
were
a
state
conviction
for
an
offense
that
would
have
been
punishable
under
the
federal
law,
their
both
being
felonies,
that
enhancement
can
apply,
in
that
instance,
and
that
that
does
meet
the
definition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
the
concession
you
made
in
response
to
my--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you've--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--answered
justice
breyer
by
citing
the
jerome
case.
after
jerome,
we
decided
united
states
vs.
gonzales,
having
to
do
with
the
consecutive
or
concurrent
sentencing
terms.
and
it...
are
those
two
cases
in
some
tension?
gonzales
didn't
mention
jerome.
and
i
noticed
that
none
of
the
briefs
mentioned
it
either.
is
there
some
tension
in
the
cases?
and,
if
so,
is
this
a
case
where,
when
we
write
an
opinion,
whatever
the
outcome,
we
should
talk
about
that?
and,
if
that's
so,
what
should
we
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
does
seem
to
limit
the
broad
statement
in
jerome,
without
mentioning
jerome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
you
say
"it
just
happens"?
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
there
in
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why
you're
here.
