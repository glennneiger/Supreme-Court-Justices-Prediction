stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
ambiguous.
that's
perfectly
ambiguous.
because,
the
case
of
your
client,
it
is
a
felony,
and
it
is
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
but
it
is
a
felony
under
south
dakota
law.
and
what
the
statute
says...
and
that's
the
government's
argument...
they
say
"any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
they
don't
mean,
necessarily,
any
felony
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
mean
anything
that
is
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--felony,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
is
also
punishable;
in
which
case,
you
lose.
but,
in
the
first
case,
you
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
am
i
supposed
to
look
to,
to
decide
which
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
you
don't
mean
that,
because
you're
prepared
to
concede...
at
least
i
thought
you
were,
until
your
last
argument...
you're
prepared
to
concede
that
if
a
person
engages
in
a
crime
that
is
punishable
as
a
felony
under
south
dakota
law,
and
it
is
also
punishable
as
a
felony
under
federal
law,
under
801,
et
seq,
well,
that
counts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
concede
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
say
your
answer
is,
you
don't
make
the
concession?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
work
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
area?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
southern--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the...
have
you
ever
heard
of,
or
had,
a
client...
or
heard
of
a
person
from
mexico
who
had
been
deported
because
he
has
been
involved
in
drugs,
and
the
government
wants
to
bring
him
back
because
he
may
be
a
witness...
maybe
something
develops,
some
other
members
of
the
gang
are
there,
they'd
like
his
information?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
pick
up
some
friends
of
his
who
are
engaged
in
drugs,
the
government
might
decide
to
try
to
get
him
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
conceivable,
i
guess,
that
people
will
break
their
parole.
often
it
doesn't
happen;
sometimes
it
does.
sometimes
they
want
to
get
him
back;
sometimes
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
prepared
to
accept
perfect
ambiguity
here,
linguistically.
and
i
thought
of
an
empirical
question,
that
you
may
know
the
answer
to,
that
might
shed
some
light.
now,
going
along
the
way...
maybe
i'm
making
a
mistake
to
point
it
out,
if
i
am...
but
i
go
to
the
key
thing
here,
which
is
the
words
in
924(c),
what
is
a
"drug-trafficking
crime"?
a
"drug-trafficking
crime"
is
a
crime...
"any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
that
could
mean
an
act,
physically,
that
is
a
felony
under
some
law,
and
is
also
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
as
a
misdemeanor.
okay?
felony
under...
it
could
pick
that
up.
and
it
also
could
mean
any
conduct
which
is
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
and
i
could
look
at
those
words
a
thousand
times
and
not
have
a
clue
which
it
means.
so,
i
thought
of
an
empirical
test.
this
statute,
924(c),
happens
to
be
a
statute
that,
if
you
engage
in
a
drug-trafficking
crime,
as
defined,
and
you
have
a
gun
with
you,
you
get
mandatory
5
years.
that's
the
point
of
it.
and
the
government
does
all
the
prosecuting.
so,
in
how
many
cases
where
a
person
committed
a
misdemeanor
offense,
simple
possession,
and
had
a
gun,
did
the
government
insist
that
they
get
the
5
years
minimum?
now,
if
you're
prepared
to
tell
me
"a
lot
of
'em",
i'm
prepared
to
tell
you,
the
government
has
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
the
way
you
are
now.
but
if
you're
prepared
to
tell
me
"zero",
i
would
say
i
would
be
suspicious
of
an
interpretation
that
comes
along
now
for
the
first
time.
and
my
mind
is
open
on
it.
i'm
quite
interested
in
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no.
we
both
agree.
all...
everybody
agrees
here.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
federal
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--correct,
it
doesn't
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
be.
it
could
be
conduct
that
violates
the
state
law,
but...
and
punish
it
under
the
state
law...
but
the
conduct
involved
would
have
to
constitute
what
is
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
i
say
it's
suspicious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
924(c)(1)
says
that
if
you
have
a
gun,
and
you
have
a
drug-trafficking
crime,
book,
5
years.
okay,
now
we
go
to
two,
what's
a
"drugtrafficking
crime"?
it
means
any
felony
punishable
under
the...
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
now,
in
your
definition,
we
first
look
to
see
whether
simple
possession
is
punishable
under
the...
in
controlled
substances
act.
it
sure
is.
it's
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor.
so,
it
meets
that.
under
your
definition,
is
it
a
felony?
yup,
it's
a
felony
in
south
dakota.
okay.
so,
now
we've
got
a
prosecution,
in
federal
court
in
south
dakota.
and,
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
that
guy
should
get
a
bump-up
of
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
still
have
to
know
whether
that
word,
(2)
means
"any
felony
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
controlled--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"substances
act".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
you
have
to
know
the
answer
to
that.
