justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
is
different,
in
the
respect
that
he
would
first
have
to
violate
the
law
by
entering
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
mr.
kneedler,
assuming
that...
as
i
understand
it,
the
answer
you
just
gave,
your
second
point,
as
well
as
the
point
that
you
and
justice
stevens
were
debating,
turns,
in
your
view,
on
a
definition,
or
a
reading,
of
the
statute
that
would
work
this
way:
that
if,
under
state
law,
the
act
were
a
felony,
but,
under
federal
law,
the
action
was
merely
a
misdemeanor,
it
would
still,
for
purposes
of
this
definition,
be
an
aggravated
felony.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
isn't
that
very
strange,
that
congress
would
have
wanted
a
reading
of
the
statute
that
would
turn
its
definition
of
a
"misdemeanor
crime"
into
an
aggravated
felony
for
purposes
of
the
immigration
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--saying,
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
know
it
says
that,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
take
you
any
further
than
saying
that
if
the
words
of
the
statute
refer
to
something
that
could
be
a
state
law
felony,
under
the...
under
the
penultimate
sentence,
it
will
count.
it
does
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
that
we
have,
and
that
is
whether
a
particular
reference
in
the
statute
is
a
reference
to
a
federal
felony
or
a
state
felony.
so,
it
has
a...
the
penultimate
sentence
has
work
to
do.
and,
in
fact,
we
can
see
the
work
being
done
in
the...
in
the
very
definition
of
"drug
trafficking"...
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
you
draw
from
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
when--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
consequence,
in
effect,
is
to
turn
for...
turn
the
gravity
of
the
federal
misdemeanor
into
the
gravity
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
felony
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
happens
to
be
a
state
felony.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
but,
if
we're
asking,
"what
is
important
in
the
mind
of
congress,
for
purposes
of
the
immigration
law?
"
one
would
suppose
that
the
most
obvious
touchstone
of
importance
is
the
way
federal
law
deals
with
it...
i.e.,
in
the
case
of
a
crime,
whether
federal
law
calls
it
a
felony
or
federal
law
calls
it
a
misdemeanor.
you
know,
in
your
reading,
when
federal
law
calls
it
a
misdemeanor,
if
state
law
calls
it
a
felony,
it
becomes
a
federal
felony
for
the
immigration
law.
and
that's
what
seems
to
me
odd.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
just
ask
one--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
one
thing
to
turn
to
state
law
to
get
an
answer
where
there
is
no
other
answer.
the
problem
here
is
that
state
law
and
federal
law
are
at
odds
in
determining
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
the
federal
law,
on
my
hypothesis,
would
say,
"it
is
minor;
it's
just
a
misdemeanor.
"
the
state
says,
"no,
it
is
a
felony.
"
it
seems
to
me
very
odd,
given
the
tension
between
the
state
and
federal
classifications,
to
say
that,
for
federal
purposes,
the
state
classification
is
going
to
trump
the
federal
classification;
and
that's
a
different
situation
from
the
one
you
posit.
