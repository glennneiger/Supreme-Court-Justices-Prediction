mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
for
a
state
drug
offense
to
be
an
aggravated
felony
under
section
1101(a)(43)(b)
of
the
ina,
two...
there
are
two
requirements.
the
underlying
conduct
must
be
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act
or
one
of
the
other
specified
federal
statutes,
and
it
must
be
a
felony.
because
petitioner's
underlying
conduct
here
was
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
and
was
a
felony
under
state
law,
they
are...
they
were
properly
found
to
have
committed
aggravated
felonies.
that
conclusion
follows,
not
just
from
section
924(c),
but,
more
importantly,
by
the
fact
that
what
is
relevant
here
is,
what
is
the
meaning
of
1101(a)(43),
which
is
the
operative
provision,
which
just
happens
to
incorporate
the
definition
of
924(c)?
and
there
are
three
features
of
1101(a)(43)
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no.
but...
no,
but...
yes.
no,
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
expressly
incorporates
it,
yes.
yes.
but
the...
but
the
operative
provision
is
section
1101(a)(43)
of
the
ina,
and
there
are
three
features
of
that
that
we
think
reinforce
this
conclusion.
the
first
is
that
the
consequences
of
aggravated
felony
status
under
the
ina
turn
on
whether
one
is
convicted,
not
whether
they
have
committed
the
crime,
and
that's
true
both
with
respect
to
the
enhancement
of
sentences
under
1326
and
the...
and
the
immigration
consequences.
and
we
think
it
makes
particular
sense
when
you're
talking
about
a
conviction
to
look
about
how
the...
to
look
at
how
the
crime
is
treated
under
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
do--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
need
a
conviction
under
section
924
if
you're
bringing
a
prosecution
under
section
924(c).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
do
not...
you
do
not
need
a
conviction.
but,
in
order...
the
immigration
consequences--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--have
been--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
our
point
is
not
that
924(c)
requires
a
conviction
when
it's
in
the
immigration
act,
it's
that
the
immigration
consequences
of
that
incorporation
turn
on
whether
someone
was
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
ground
of
deportation
that
refers
to
"aggravated
felony"
refers
to
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony.
the
ineligibility
for
cancellation
of
removal
turns
on
whether
someone
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony,
and
the
enhanced
penalties
under
section
1326
for
someone
whose
illegal
reentry,
following
aggravated
felony,
is
for
a
conviction
for
an
aggravated
felony.
so,
my
point
is
that,
under
the
ina,
the
consequences
turn
on
conviction,
and
it
makes
sense
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction...
here,
state
law...
to
see
whether
it...
to
look
at
the...
to
determine
the
status
of
the
crime.
and
since
state
law
determines
it
to
be
a
felony,
that's
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--proper
place
to
look.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
it
does,
for
several
reasons.
first,
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
requirement,
the
uniformity
provision
applies
to
uniform
rules
of
naturalization;
that
is,
citizenship.
this...
we're
not
talking
about
citizenship
here,
we're
talking...
we're
talking
about
the
eligibility
of
aliens
to
remain
in
the
country.
beyond
that,
even
where
the
uniformity
clause
applies...
and
there's,
for
example,
a
parallel
uniformity
clause
for
bankruptcy...
that's
never
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
consequences
of
certain
conduct
under
state
law
can
have
no
impact
on
bankruptcy
law,
and
that
there
can't
be
a
variation.
the
state-law
homestead
exemption
under
the...
under
the
bankruptcy
laws
is
a
good
example
of
that.
but,
going
beyond
that,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
uniformity
generally,
congress
has
established
uniform
standards
in
section
1101,
either
in
terms
of
identifying
the
conduct
in
certain
instances;
in
other
instances,
by
identifying
the
minimum
sentence
that
was
actually
imposed.
in
this
case,
we
think,
with
respect
to
drug-trafficking
crimes,
it...
it's
imposed
a
uniform
standard,
in
terms
of
the
length
of
the
sentence;
it
has
to
be
a
felony.
that's...
that
is
uniformity.
but
the...
to
answer
your
point
more
directly,
it
is
a
principle
throughout
1101(a)(43)
that
one
looks
to
state
law,
not
to...
not
to
a...
some
supposed
uniform
standard
of
federal
law.
and,
for
example,
if
you...
several
subparagraphs...
and
if
you'll...
1101(a)(43)
is
set
out
at
page
12(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief...
three
subparagraphs...
(j),
(q),
and
(t)...
refer
to
the
sentence
that
may
be
imposed
for
a
violation.
well,
when
you're
talking
about
a
state
conviction,
that's
clearly
referring
to
the
sentence
that
may
be
imposed
under
state
law
for
a
conviction.
four
other
subparagraphs...
(f),
(g),
(r),
and
(s)...
turn
on
the
sentence
that
was
actually
imposed.
that
means
that...
in
the
case
of
a
state
crime,
as
we
have
here,
that
state
law
has
to
authorize
the
sentence,
and
that
the
state
court,
applying
state
sentencing
principles,
has
actually
imposed
a
crime
of...
for...
of
at
least
1
year.
so,
it
is...
it
is
infused
in
section
1101(a)(43)
that,
in
fact,
you
do
look
to
the
consequences
of
an
offense
under
state
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
to
my
knowledge,
we
have
not
brought
crime...
prosecutions
under
924(c)(1),
based
on
the
circumstances
you
posit,
but
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
very
far
with
respect
to
answering
this
question.
for
one
thing,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
gonzales
decision,
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
federal
crime,
and,
therefore,
a
federal
felony
under
924(c)(2),
comes
from
the
language
in
924(c)(1)
that
says
that
the
crime
must
be
subject
to
prosecution
in
a
court
of
the
united
states.
and
this
court,
in
gonzales,
said
it's
that
language
that
renders
the...
renders
it
a
requirement
that
it
be
a
federal
crime.
the
definition
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
doesn't
have
to
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
1101--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
would
have
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
our
view,
it
would
have
to
constitute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
have
to
be
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
important
point
here
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
question
is
not
what
924(c)(2)
means,
standing
alone
or
in
the
abstract;
it's
what
it
means,
as
incorporated
into
1101(a)(43).
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
petitioner
has
conceded,
as
i
understand
it...
i
heard
mr.
long,
i
think,
concede...
that
possession
offenses
can
constitute
aggravated
felonies
under
this
provision,
that
there
is
the
recidivist
possession,
there
is
the
possession
of
the
date-rape
drug,
there
is
possession
of
5
grams
or
more
of
cocaine.
all
of
those
are
specified
as
being...
of
being
felonies
under
the...
under
940...
or
844.
but,
beyond
that,
it's
important
to
take
into
account
that
a
lot
of
state
statutes
dealing
with
drugs
do
not...
are
not
patterned
directly
after
the
federal
statute,
and
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
insisted
that
they
do
so
in
order
for
this
statute
to
operate
sensibly.
and
one
notable
example,
for
instance,
is,
when
it
comes
to
possession
of
a
substantial
amount
of
drugs,
that
that
certainly
would
create
a
strong
implication
that
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
trafficking
activities,
or
intended
to.
the
federal
statute
deals
with
that
by
making
it
a
felony
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
the
drug.
a
number
of
states
don't
do
that.
they,
instead,
have
graduated
possession
offenses,
based
on
the
quantity
of
drugs
that
the
defendant
is
possessing;
that
above
a
certain
quantity
of
drugs,
it
would
be
a
felony.
they're
getting
at
the
same
problem,
but
they've
come
at
it
in
a
different
way.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
always
be
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
that.
now,
in
mr.
lopez's
case,
he
was...
he
was
initially
charged
with
a
series
of
offenses
that
went
beyond
the
aiding
and
abetting
of
possession
that
he
ultimately
pleaded
guilty
to,
but,
as
he
testified
in
his...
in
his
immigration
hearing,
his
aiding
and
abetting
of
possession
was
assisting
someone
in
purchasing
drugs,
which
was,
itself,
a
trafficking
element.
and
so,
this
shows
that
the
way
the
state
crimes
are
defined
or
applied
are
often
getting
at
what
federal
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
probably
would,
but
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
version
of
924(c)
that
was
in
effect
prior
to
1988
said
exactly
that.
it
said
"felony
violation
of
federal
law".
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was...
it
was
explicit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress
did
change
it,
in
the
1988
act,
but
it
did
it...
and
this
is
significant...
it
did
it
in
connection
with
two
changes
in
the
immigration
law.
one
is
the
enactment
of
the
definition
of
"aggravated
felony",
which,
as
i
have
explained,
the
definition
of
"aggravated
felony"
looks
to
state
law,
in
a
number
of
respects,
in
terms
of
the
severity
of
the
offense
or
the
punishment
actually
imposed.
that
was
one
change.
the
other
change
that
was
made
in
the
1988
act
was
to
amend
section
1326
with
respect
to
illegal
reentries,
and
it
did
that
by
enhancing
the
penalty
for
conviction
of
any
felony
other
than
an
aggravated
felony,
and
an
aggravated
felony.
and
certainly
the
conviction
of
any
felony
includes
state
law
offenses
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
says...
yes,
it
says
"any
felony".
and
that
is
our...
doing
it...
and
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
conduct
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--punishable.
the
conduct
is
punishable,
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not...
i
think
not
used
in
that
sense,
but
i
think
it's
important...
it's
important
to
look
at
the
language,
as
a
whole.
it
does
not
say
"punishable
as
a
felony
under"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--"under
the
controlled"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
no,
i
agree
that
the...
i...
in
my
view,
the
key
to
the
case
is
in
1101(a)(43),
because,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
1101(a)(43)...
and
this
gets
to
the
question
you...
you
said...
you
mentioned
that
i
had
three
reasons.
one
is
that
under
the...
under
the
ina,
the
conviction
consequences
turn
on
the
conviction
of
an
aggravated
felony,
and
it
only
makes
sense
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
crime,
whether
it's
a
felony.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
under
924(c),
you
don't.
but
under
the...
under
the...
if
you're
bringing
a
federal
prosecution
under
924(c),
the
term
"aggravated
felony"
has
no
role
in
that
determination.
it
is
a...
it
is
a
separate
federal
crime.
we're
talking
about,
here,
the
consequences
of...
the
consequences
of
being
an
aggravated
felon
under
1101(a)(43)
are,
where
does
the
definition
of
"aggravated
felony"
apply?
it
only
applies
under
the
ina
if
someone
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony.
you're
only...
you're
only
subject
to
deportation
for
aggravated
felony
if
you've
been
convicted,
you're
ineligible
for
cancellation
or
removal,
you're
subject
to
sentence
enhancement.
all
those
things
follow
on
conviction.
and
we
think
it
only
makes
sense
to
look
to
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction.
that
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
and
for
one...
for
one
thing...
as
i've
mentioned,
the
structure
of
the
act,
as
a
whole,
of
1101(a)(43)...
and
there
are
numerous
subsections...
look
to
how
the
crime...
what
the
authorized
punishment
was,
or
look
to
how
the
person
was
actually
sentenced
under
state
law,
not
under
federal
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
also
haven't
mentioned
the
explicit
provision,
that
one
of
the
other
justices
mentioned
earlier...
i
think,
the
chief
justice...
that
the
penultimate
sentence
of
1101(a)(43)
says
that
something...
a...
an
offense
constitutes
an
aggravated
felony,
whether
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
think...
we
think
it
is
quite
a...
we
think
it's
a
strong
confirmation
of
the
pattern
in
1101(a)(43),
that
the
statute
looks
to
what
happened
in
state
court,
and
the
state
punishment
that
was
authorized
there,
and
the
express
mention
of
that...
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
federal
controlled--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
federal
controlled
substances
act
does
not
occupy
the
field
of
drug
control
in
the
country,
any
more
than
any
other
federal
crime
occupies
that
field.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and
this
is
not
the
only
place
where
that
consequence
can
arise.
there
are...
there
are
cases
involving
"what's
a
crime
of
violence"?
which
is...
which,
under
subparagraph
(g),
is
another
aggravated
felony.
the
crime
of
violence
is
defined
in
18
u.s.c.
section
16,
subsection
(b)
of
that...
this
court
considered
that
statute
in
leocal...
requires
that
the
offense
be
a
felony
which
creates
a
serious
risk
of
physical
harm.
the
courts
have
looked
to
the
state
law
of
conviction
to
determine
whether
something
is
a
felony--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
that
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
and...
if
i
could
just
mention
one
other...
on
other
example,
under
the
theft...
offense
category
in
subsection...
i
think
it's
(f)...
where
a
theft
offense
is
deemed
to
be
an
aggravated
felony
if
a
sentence
of
at
least
1
year
was
imposed.
there
are
misdemeanor
offenses
there
that...
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
can
be
a
misdemeanor
for
certain
types
of
theft
offenses;
and
yet,
they
are
covered
as
aggravated
felonies.
and,
again,
that
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
our
position,
yes.
because
the
requirement...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and
we...
yes.
we
think
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
the
immigration
law.
and,
again,
we
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--924(c)?
no,
you
don't,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
aggravated-felony
question
has
no...
has
no...
the
924--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
924--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
924(c)(1),
this
court...
this
court,
in
the
gonzales
case,
said
that
it...
that
it
has
to
be
a
federal
crime,
but
not
because
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--definition
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--924(c)(2)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
think
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
under
924(c),
the
cases
that
have
been
brought
have
all
been
situations
where
it
is
a
federal
offense.
but,
because...
not
because
of
the
language
in
924(c)(2)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
because
of
the...
of
the
language--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
924(c)(1).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
my
understanding
of
the
way
924(c)(1)
has
operated
is
that
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law,
but
maybe
it
would
be
a
federal
felony,
it
would
not
be...
it
would
not
give
rise
to
the
enhancement,
because
it
is
not
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
not
under...
not
under
924(c)(2)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
definitional--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that
is
not
our
reading
of
the
statute.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
only
thing
that
is
incorporated
into
1101(a)(43)
is
the
definition
in
(c)(2)...
not
(c)(1),
the
definition
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
(c)(2),
which
says--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--"felony
punishable
under
the
controlled"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--"substances
act".
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
what
gets
plugged
into--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--1101(a)--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--(43).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
along
with
all
of
the
other
provisions
in
1101(a)(43),
you
look
to
state
law,
in
the
case
of
a
state
offense...
the
state
of
conviction,
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
conviction...
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
crime.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
number--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
that
have
looked
at
this
in
the
sentencing
context
over
the
years
have
concluded
that
it...
that
the
absence
of
that
language
is
very
significant,
and
the
presence
of
the
language
that
says
"any
felony"
is
also
significant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
that...
and
that...
that's
not
true--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
it's...
that's
not...
only
true
under
this
provision
of
1101(a)(43).
the
other...
the
other
provisions...
(f)
and
(g)
and
(j)
and
(q)
and
(t)
that
i
mentioned,
that
looked
to
the
sentence
that
may
be
imposed
under
state
law,
or
that
was
actually
imposed...
would,
likewise,
render
someone
in
that
situation
who
was
convicted
of
only
a
misdemeanor
in
state
court...
even
though
it
might
be
a
felony
under
federal
law,
they
would
not
be...
they
would
not
be
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
the
way
congress
chose
to
write
1101(a)(43).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
is.
i
mean,
they're--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think...
as
i
say,
i
think
it's
on
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that...
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendment
in
1990
does
not
discuss
the
aspect
of
barrett
that
went
to
the
comparison
to
decide
what...
in
what
circumstances
there
would
be
an
analogous
federal
crime.
it
was
clear
that
it
wanted
to
ratify
the
result
that
state
crimes
are
covered.
but
we
think
that
that
was
evident
from
the
1988
amendments
to...
that
both
enacted
the
definition
of
1988...
and
enhanced
sentences--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
1326,
clearly
on
the...
on...
by
reference
to
whether
someone
was
convicted
of
a
state
felony,
without
any...
without
any
general
federal
minimum.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
toledo-flores.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we
think
it
is
wrong,
be...
under
this
court's
decision
in
spencer
versus
kemna
and
other
cases,
that,
if
the
possible
consequence
turns
on
a
discretionary
judgment
that
may
be
made
by
someone
else,
that
is
too
speculative
to
constitute
a
real
live
case
or
controversy.
and
that's
what
i
understand
toledo-flores
to
be
arguing,
is
that
if
he
applied
for
discretionary
relief
in
the
future,
that
it
might...
it
might
matter,
because
his
sentence
might
be
reduced
slightly.
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
district
court
toledo-flores
conceded
that
if
he
didn't
get
an
eight...
level
sentence
enhancement,
he
would
get
a
four-level
sentence
enhancement,
because
this
is
at
least
a
felony,
within
the
meaning
of
the
adjacent
provision
of
the
guidelines.
that
would
result
in
a
guideline
range
of
24
to
30
months.
he
would
then
have
gotten
24
months,
under
that
guideline
range,
the
very
same
thing
that
he
got
here.
and,
under
the
guidelines
at
the
time,
a
term
of
supervised
release
was
mandatory.
and
a
1-year
term
of
supervised
release
was
mandatory
in
those
circumstances.
he
would
have
gotten
exactly
the
same
term
of
supervised
release
if
he
had
been...
if
he
had
gotten
only
the
four...
level
enhancement,
rather
than
the
eight-level
enhancement.
i
also
think
that
it
is
somewhat
farfetched
to
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
toledo-flores
had
more
than
12
illegal
entries
into
the
united
states,
and
various
state
offenses,
that
the
determination
of
whether
the
attorney
general
would
actually
grant
discretionary
relief
would
turn
on
a
marginal
difference
in
the
sentence
on
that
particular
offense.
