chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
lopez
versus
gonzales
and
toledo-flores
versus
united
states.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
carry
too
much
weight,
though,
because
the
provision
that...
i'm
looking
at
(g)(3),
"violates
any
state
law
relating
to
any
controlled
substance.
"
can
be
broader
than
what's
punishable
under
the
federal
controlled
substances--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
has
it
ever
been
applied
in
a...
to
a
statute
that
specifically
says
that
the
term
"aggravated
felony"
applies
to
an
offense
described
in
this
paragraph,
whether
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
express
legislative
repudiation
of
the
jerome--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--principle.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
crooks,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
no
supervised
release
of
people
outside
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
like
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
going
to
happen
to
him
if
he
does
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
has
anything
like
that
ever
happened
before
with
people
subject
to
supervised
release
who
are
then
deported?
it
would
be
the
first
time,
if
the
district
court
did
that,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
that...
in
that
instance,
action
can
be
taken
against
him
if
he
does
further
violate
the
law
under
the
terms
of
probation.
the
point
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
probation
office
or
the
district
court
doesn't
extend
to
mexico.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't
want
to
say
that
your
case
is
not
moot
because
your
client
is
going
to
violate
the
law
again
in
the
future.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--course,
that's...
when
you
get
to
that,
it
must
give
you
pause
that
your
analysis
is
of
a
term,
"drug-trafficking
crime"
or
"illicit
trafficking",
and
your
theory
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
simple
possession
equates
with
drug
trafficking.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
long,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
you
conceded
that
a
state
offense
could
constitute
illicit
trafficking--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
a
controlled
substance--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
long.
the
case
is
submitted.
