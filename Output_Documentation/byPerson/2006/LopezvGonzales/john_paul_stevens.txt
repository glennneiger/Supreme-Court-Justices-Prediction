justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--make
the
concession,
as
i
understand
it,
because
it's
a
federal
felony,
not
because
it's
a
state
felony--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
that
right?
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
saying
it
would
also
include
state
trafficking
offense,
because
it's
described
in
the
word
"trafficking"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ask
this
question?
it's...
presuming...
supposing
we
say
it's
not
moot,
and
you
prevail.
could
he
be
resentenced
without
being
present
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
we
have
a
case
in
which
we're
assuming,
for
our
purposes,
we
just
have
possession.
i
mean,
i
understand
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
wanted
to
ask...
i
have
two
questions,
mr.
kneedler.
one
of
them...
the
second
one,
i'd
ask
that...
you
were
going
to
mention
three
different
points,
one
about
conviction;
you
had
two
other
points
you
didn't
get
to.
i
want
to
learn
what
those
were.
but,
before
that,
it
seems
to
me
that,
when
you
put
the
whole
statute...
all
the...
all
the
different
statutory
provisions
together,
you
really
boil
down
and
focus
on
924(c)(2)
and
the
words
"for
purpose
of
this
subsection,
the
term
"drug-trafficking
crime"
means
any
felony
punishable
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
"
and
if
the
word
"federal"
had
been
inserted
before
the
word
"felony"
in
the
statute,
would
that
not
make
the
statute
perfectly
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
a
question
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
the
change
was
intended
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--substantive--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
merely--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--stylistic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
again,
mr.
kneedler...
focusing
again
on
that
specific
language,
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
that
phrase
means
any
state
or
federal
felony
punishable
under
the
federal
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
ever
true
that
a
state
felony
is
punishable
under
a
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
we've
said
a
state
felony
is
punishable
under
a
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
the
key
to
the
case
is
how
we
read
that
one
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
a
reasonable...
let's
say
the
statute's
ambiguous,
and
you've
convinced
us
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
of
uniformity.
but
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
would
want
the
different
consequences
to
depend
on
the
state
of
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
suggesting
that?
