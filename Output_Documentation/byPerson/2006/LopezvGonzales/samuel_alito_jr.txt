justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
8
u.s.c.
1101(a)(43)(b),
what,
in
your
view,
does
the
first
phrase,
"illicit
trafficking
in
a
controlled
substance.
"
add
to
the
reference
to
a
drug-trafficking
crime--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--as
defined
by
924(c)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
are
there
any
trafficking
offenses
that
would
not
fall
within
924(c)
if
you
define
a
"trafficking
offense"
that
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
no,
there--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--are
possessory...
there
are
924(c),
but
is
it
not
the
case
that
any...
if
you
interpret
"trafficking"
to
mean
trafficking
in
the
way
the
word
would
be
used
in
ordinary
speech...
that
any
state
trafficking
offense
you
can
think
of
would
have
a
corresponding
felony
violation
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
so
that
if
you
read
the
statute
that
way,
the
initial
phrase
is
superfluous?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
ask
the
same
question
a
different
way.
if...
since
924(c)
includes
some
924(c),
doesn't
that
show
that
the
way
congress
used
"illicit
trafficking
in
a
controlled
substance.
"
is
not
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
is
used
in
ordinary
speech,
but's
much
broader,
so
that
it
can
include
"mere
possession"
offenses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
there's
a
uniform
federal
definition
of
a
theft
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's...
they'll...
there's
no
variation
in
state
offenses
that
would
fall
within
that,
a
theft
offense?
