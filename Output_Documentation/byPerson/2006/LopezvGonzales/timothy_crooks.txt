mr.
timothy
crooks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
government's
contention
that
mr.
toledo-flores's
appeal
is
moot.
his
appeal
of
his
sentence
is
not
moot,
primarily
because
he
is
still
subject
to
the
sentence
that
is
the
subject
of
that
appeal.
even
though
mr.
toledo-flores
was
released
from
prison
on
april
21st
of
this
year,
and
deported
to
mexico,
he's
still
subject
to
the
supervised-release
portion
of
his
sentence,
because
supervised
release
is
not
automatically
extinguished
by
deportation.
mr.
timothy
crooks
there's
no
supervision
of
people
outside
the
united
states,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
he
is
still
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
and
still
subject
to
the
conditions
of
supervised
release
that
are
not
dependent
upon
supervision.
mr.
timothy
crooks
well,
for
example,
he
shall
not
excessively
use
alcohol,
he
shall
not
associate
with
persons
who--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--if
the
district
court
learns
about
it
he
could
be
violated...
he
could
be
extradited
back
from
mexico,
and
he
could
face
up
to
a
year
more
in
prison.
mr.
timothy
crooks
there
have
been
instances
in
the
case
law
where
people
on
supervised
release
have
been
extradited
back
from
foreign
countries
based
on
violations
of
their
supervised
release.
but
the
point
is,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
mr.
toledo-flores
is
still
subject
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
modify
his
supervised
release,
to
change
the
conditions,
or
to
cut
the
supervised
release.
if
the
district
court
learns
of
a
violation
and
a
violation
warrant
is
filed
within
the
supervised-release
period
then
the
supervised-release
period
is
effectively
tolled
and
the
district
court--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--retains--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--until
april
20th
of
next
year,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
after
april
20th,
of
course,
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decisions
in
spencer
v.
kemna
and
lane
v.
williams,
the
court
needs
to
look
for
a
collateral
consequence
of
the
then-expired
sentence.
and,
in
this
case,
we
point
to
the
possibility
that
a
retrospective
reduction
in
the
term
of
imprisonment...
which,
of
course,
will
not
give
excess
prison
time
back
to
mr.
toledo-flores...
but
even
to
reduce
the
number
of
the
sentence,
on
paper,
could
be
a
favorable
factor
for
him
to
get
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility,
should
he
ever
want
to
get
a
nonimmigrant
visa
in
the
future
to
come
visit
his
u.s.
citizen
children.
mr.
timothy
crooks
well,
my
answer
to
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
this
court
has
never
said
that
an
appeal
of
a
sentence
may
become
moot
before
that
sentence
is
expired.
and
in
cases
like
lane
v.
williams
and
spencer
v.
kemna,
the
sentences
were
completely
expired,
and,
therefore,
the
court
had
to
look
for
collateral
consequences
of
the
now-expired
sentence.
here,
in
consequence...
in
contrast,
mr.
toledo-flores
is
still
under
the
sentence,
which
is
a
direct
consequence--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--but
that
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to
a
person
who
is
in
the
united
states,
who
is
subject
to
a
term
of
probation
where
the
only
condition
is
that
he
not
further
violate
the
law.
in
that--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--instance--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--well,
that's
true.
but
if
we're
talking
about
future
violations
of
the
law,
it
is
very
often
the
case
that
persons
who
are
deported
to
mexico
do
come
back,
and
do
have
their
supervised
release--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--revoked.
mr.
timothy
crooks
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor,
but
i'm
saying
that,
in
the
respect
that
you
just
talked
about
for
the
u.s.
citizen,
it's
not
any
different,
that
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
violate
the
supervised
release,
and
to
revoke
it,
and
then
to
send
him
back
to
prison.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
is
true.
but
in
most
cases,
that
is
the
only
violation
of
supervised
release
for
which
they
are
later
revoked.
and,
in
that
respect,
it
would
be
no
different
from
a
person
who
violates
his
probation
by
driving
while
intoxicated
or
committing
some
other
legal
violation.
mr.
timothy
crooks
we
cited,
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
4,
your
honor,
the
hamdi
case,
united
states
v.
hamdi,
from
the
second
circuit,
where
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
possibility
of
reducing
the
term
of
imprisonment,
even
retrospectively,
could
have
an
impact
on
the
ability
to
get
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
in--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--the
future.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
hamdi,
they
pointed
out
that
the
length
of
the
sentence
goes
to
two
of
the
three
factors
that
are
evaluated
by
immigration
officials...
under
a
decision
called
matter
of
heronka...
that
are
used
in
evaluating
whether
a
person
should
be
granted
a
waiver
of
inadmissibility
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
he's--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--got
u.s.
citizen--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
he...
he
could
qualify
for
a
nonimmigrant
visa
at
some
point--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--he
has
not,
your
honor,
but
he
does
have
u.s.
citizen--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--children--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--but
this
court
has
never
held
that
a...
it
would
be
unfair
to
hold
that
an
appeal
of
a
sentence
can
be
moot
while
that
sentence
is
still
in
effect,
and
when
it
can
still
have
consequences
for
mr.
toledo-flores.
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
all
the
other
cases
decided
by
this
court,
is
that
the
sentence
itself
is
the
concrete
and
continuing
injury
that
defeats--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--mootness
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
crooks
yes,
he
could,
your
honor.
we
do
resentencing
in
absentia
all
the
time
in
the
southern
district
of
texas--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--in
circumstances
that
are
similar.
mr.
timothy
crooks
that
does
happen
occasionally.
people
are
paroled,
then,
to
testify
in
court
proceedings
or
to
cooperate
with
federal--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--or
state--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
crooks
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--that
that
is
in
the
work.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--that's
all
very
true,
justice
breyer.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that,
in
campo
serrano,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
held
that
a
deported
alien's
probation
term
was
a
continuing
criminal
sentence
that
saved
the
case
from
mootness.
and
the
court
pointed
to
the
fact
that
he...
that
the
deported
alien
in
campo
serrano
could,
just
like
mr.
toledo-flores,
have
his
conditional
release
revoked,
and
he
could
be
reimprisoned,
upon
a
finding
that
he
had
violated
his
conditions.
and
we
believe
that
campo
serrano
points
very
strongly
in
the
direction
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
on
the
merits,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
interpretation
that
is
advanced
by
the
petitioners
here
promotes
the
very
sort
of
uniformity
that
this
court
has
found
desirable
in
cases
like
jerome
v.
united
states
and
its
progeny,
including
taylor
v.
united
states,
in
that
the
same
conduct
of
conviction
will
have
the
same
immigration
and
same
federal
sentencing
consequences,
irrespective
of
the
labels
or
maximum
prison
terms
affixed
by
the
particular
states
that
set
out
that
conduct.
and--
mr.
timothy
crooks
--thank
you.
