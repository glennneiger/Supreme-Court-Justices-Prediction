where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
are
those
sections?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
sections...
(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
case
involving
standing
which
says
that...
you
know,
the
doctrine
of
standing
is
more
than
a...
an
exercise
in
the...
in
the
conceivable.
and
this
seems
to
me
an
exercise
in
the
conceivable.
nobody
thinks
your
client
is
really,
you
know,
abstaining
from
tequila
down
in
mexico
because
he's
on
supervised
release
in
the
united
states,
or
is
going...
is
going
to
apply...
having
been
deported
from
the
country
for
criminal
offenses,
is
going
to
apply
to
come
back
in
the...
these
are
ingenious
exercises
in
the
conceivable.
this
is
just
not
the
real
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
depends
on
whether
you
consider
the
sentence
to
be
effectively
expired
once
he
leaves
the
country,
if
the
sentence
is
one
of
supervised
release,
which
is
impossible
once
he
leaves
the
country.
supervision
being
impossible,
supervised
release
is
not
a
realistic
consequence
of
the
prior
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
there's
a
realistic
possibility
that
this
person
is
going
to
be
readmitted?
a
realistic
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
there's
a
realistic
possibility
he's
going
to
try
to
get
readmitted,
so
that
he
can
be
subjected
to
really
enforced
supervised
release?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
he
applied
for
such
a
visa?
has
he
expressed
any
intention
to
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
it's
an
exercise
in
the
conceivable,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
indication
that
that's
in
the
works,
or
is
this
just
another
conceivable
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
government
has
taken
the
position...
and
as
far
as
i
know,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
bought
the
government's
argument...
that
there...
you
do
not
need
a
conviction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
924(c)
is
incorporated
in
1101(a)(43).
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--incorporated.
so,
you
want
us
to
interpret
924(c)
one
way
for
criminal
convictions...
a
criminal
sentence...
that
is,
you
don't
need
a
conviction
in
order
to
get
the
enhancement...
but
another
way
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
ina?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
don't...
you
don't
look
to
the
jurisdiction
of
conviction.
are
you
telling
me
you
require
a
conviction?
you...
i
thought
you
told
me
you
don't
require
a
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
could
i
ask
you
about
your
assertion
that
you
"look
to
the
state
of
conviction?
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
for
purposes
of
1101.
does
that
mean,
if
you're
convicted,
in
state
court,
of
a
misdemeanor...
and
even
though
that
action
would
be
a
federal
felony,
it's
not
an
aggravated
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
sort
of
a
double
inconsistency.
not
only
do
you
treat
state...
state
actions
that
are...
that
are
minimal...
i'm
sorry,
where
the
state
treats
it
more
seriously
than
the
federal
government,
not
only
do
you
follow
the
state,
but,
where
the
state
treats
it
less
leniently
than
the
federal
government,
you
also
follow
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
look
to
the
state
of
conviction.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
for
purposes
of
the
immigration
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
do
you
do
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
felony
enhancement
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--very
strange.
you
would
look
to
the...
you
would
look
to
the
state
law
for
purposes
of
the
immigration
section;
but,
for
purposes
of
924(c),
what
would
you
look
to?
either
one.
whichever--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whichever...
for
924...
whichever
one
would
make
it
a
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
a
felony
under
either
one,
for
purposes
of
924(c),
you
lose,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
act
is
either
a
state
felony
or
a
federal
felony,
you
lose.
i
mean,
the
defendant
gets
the
enhanced
sentence,
right,
under
924(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--listen.
justice
antonin
scalia
listen.
my
question
is
a
simple
one.
if
it's...
it
seems
to
me,
if
it's...
what
you're
saying
is,
if
it
is
either
a
felony
under
federal
law
or
a
felony
under
state
law,
you
get
the
enhanced
sentence
under
924(c),
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
the
whole
argument
is
about,
whether
it
has
to
be
a
felony
under
federal
law.
you're
telling
me,
if
it's
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law,
that
you
don't
get--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
enhanced
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
thoroughly
confused
me
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
sentencing,
let's
get
back
to
the
immigration.
if
i
understand
what
you're
now
saying,
if
you're
convicted
in
state
court
of
action
that
is
a
federal
felony,
but
it's
just
a
state
misdemeanor...
right
+/?
you
look
to
the
state
of
conviction,
and
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor,
and
the
immigration
provisions
would
not...
would
not
take
effect.
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
