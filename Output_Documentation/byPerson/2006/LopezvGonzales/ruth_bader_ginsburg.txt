justice
ruth

--is
it...
if
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute,
do
you...
what
mileage
do
you
get
from
barrett?
there
is
certainly
an
argument
that
what
was...
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
codify
that
practice
of
saying,
"if
there
is
analogous
felony...
if
there
is
analogous
crime
under
state
law,
that
should
be
included.
"
and
that
made
good
sense.

what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
period
has
how
many
months
to
run?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
you
said
you
rely
primarily
on
that
argument...
do
you
have
another
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
collateral
consequences,
do
you
have...
what
is
your
best
authority
to
say
that
in...
it
would
keep
this
case
from
being
moot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
the
length
of
the
sentence
counts
heavily
in
the
attorney
general's
assessment,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
there
is
room
for
more
than
one
construction
of
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
unseemly,
in
the
immigration
context,
to
say
that
two
people
who
have
committed
the
identical
acts,
one
of
them
is
barred
from
ever
coming
back,
doesn't
have
any
of
the
dispensations,
and
the
other
does,
because
of
the
happenstance
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
convicted.
that
kind
of
disuniformity
in
an
area
where
the
constitution
expressly
charges
congress
with
authority
to
make
uniform
laws,
it's...
doesn't
that
uniform-law
specification
in
the
constitution
tug
in
the
direction
of
the
interpretation
that
mr.
long
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--presenting
to
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
in
those
cases,
you
can
say
the
conduct
would
constitute
a
felony
under
the
federal
statute;
but
here,
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
amount
involved
would
not
have
qualified
for
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
under
federal
law.

mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--barrett
suggests
otherwise.
if
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
codify
that
practice
of
looking
for
an
analogous
crime
under
state
law,
that's...
that
seems
to
me
the...
at
least
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.

you--

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
just
switch
gears
for
a
moment,
because
your
time
is
almost
up,
and
we...
you
haven't
addressed
the
mootness
problem
in
toledo-flores.
justice

is
the
second
circuit
wrong
in
u.s.
v.
hamdi?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
u.s.
v.
hamdi
is
on
all
fours
with
respect
to
mootness.
