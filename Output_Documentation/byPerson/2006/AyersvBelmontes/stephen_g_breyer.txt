i
don't
see,
anywhere
in
mr.
schick's
statement,
at
least
from
165
to
170,
where
he
says
what
you
said
he
said.
now,
maybe
he
says
it
some
other
place,
but...
i'd
like
the
reference
to
it...
but
i...
what
i
have
him
as
saying
is
that...
he
says,
for
example,
several
times,
"the
presence...
i
don't
suggest
that
the...
that
the
presence
of
religion,
in
itself,
is
totally
mitigating.
"
well,
it
certainly
wasn't,
in
this
instance.
i
gather
i'm
right.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
all
this
religious
conversion
took
place
before
he
murdered
the
girl?
so,
this
is
not
a
case
of
your
trying
to
get
some
evidence
that
took
place
after
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right,
then
maybe
it
does
more
easily
fit
within
factor
(k).
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
they
should
consider
it,
or
they
could.
the
judge
told
the
jury
they
could
consider
it...
it
sounded
as...
says,
"you
take
it...
this
is
an
example.
"
--he
says,
"it's
an
example
in
factor
(k).
"
maybe
he's
wrong,
but
they
certainly
likely
think
they
can
consider
it.
and
mr.
schick
doesn't
say
it's
not
in
factor
(k).
at
least,
i
don't
see
it.
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
know
the
point
of
factor
(k).
i'm
trying
to
be
absolutely
certain,
before
thinking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
didn't
say
it,
that
i've
made
every
effort
to
get
from
you
the
place
where...
that
this...
where
the
defense
counsel
says,
"jury,
i
agree,
you
cannot
put
this
into
factor
(k).
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
were
his
words
"it
doesn't
constitute
an
excuse"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"in
any
way".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
