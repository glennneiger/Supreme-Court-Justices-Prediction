mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
here
is
respondent's
60-second
nutshell
summary
of
our
core
position.
this
case
does
not
turn
on
the
constitutional
factor
(k)
standing
alone.
rather,
it
turns
on
a
straightforward
application
of
the
boyde
test,
to
the
unusual,
unique
circumstances
that
occurred
during
the
arguments,
instructions
to
deliberations
at
the
penalty
trial
of
this
case.
here
are
the
two
key
components
of
our
claim.
during
arguments
to
the
jury,
both
counsel
conveyed
to
the
jury
that
belmontes'
evidence
of
youth
authority
religious
experience
was
not
covered
by
factor
(k).
however,
both
counsel
suggested
to
the
jury
that
it
should
be
considered
anyway.
now,
this
is
unusual,
because,
of
all...
of
all
the
things
that
the
district
attorney
and
the
defense
counsel
disagreed
on,
this
was
one
that
they
did
agree
on,
and
it's
likely
that
the
jury
would
have
taken
note
of
that.
the
case
then
proceeded
to
instructions
and
deliberations.
the
jury
came
back
to
court,
announced
that
they
were
deeply
divided,
perhaps
with
a
majority
favoring
life.
the
turning
point
occurred
when
one
juror,
juror
hern,
requested
judicial
confirmation
that
the
specific
list
of
factors
previously
given
was
the
only
base...
was
the
only
framework
within
which
the
penalty
decision
could
be
made.
at
that
point,
the
trial
court
had
a
constitutional
obligation
to
disabuse
juror
hern
and
the
rest
of
the
assembled
jurors
of
that
misapprehension
and,
at
the
very
least,
to
reinstruct
the
jurors
that
the
enumerated
factors
were
merely
illustrative
and
not
exhaustive,
and
instruct
the
jurors
that
the
jury
had
to
consider
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence.
the
trial
court
did
neither,
with
the
result
that
the
jury
all
too
likely
returned
to
its
deliberations
with
the
belief
that
the
only
factors...
the
only
matters
they
considered...
could
consider
were
those
encompassed
within
the
enumerated
factors,
and
believing...
based
on
counsel's
prior
arguments...
that
factor
(k)
did
not
include
the
youth
authority
religious-experience
evidence.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
it
occurred
in
argument.
and
my
counsel...
esteemed
co-counsel
will
give
me
the
exact
page...
but
it
occurred
in
the
context...
the
context...
during
the
prosecutor's
argument,
the
prosecutor
said
to
the
jury
that,
"i
suspect"...
and
then
he,
for
emphasis,
said,
"i
can't
imagine
that
you
won't
be
told
that
the
religious-conversion
evidence
doesn't
fit
within
factor
(k).
"
and,
at
that
point,
he
expressed
reservations,
doubts,
as
to
whether
it
did
fit
in
factor
(k)
or--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--any
other
factor.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
i'm
more
than--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
it
has...
if
it...
oh,
your
honor,
the...
calling
your...
or
you've
called
my
attention
to
the
instruction
that
said
that
the
set...
in
the
prior
set
of...
or
in
the
general
set
of
instructions,
that
the
enumerated
factors
were
merely
illustrative.
now,
that
instruction
had
a
cloud
of
confusion
surrounding
it,
because
the
way
it
was
phrased
was,
the
court
said,
"the
mitigating
factors
that
i
have
expressed
to
you
are
illustrative.
"
there
was
no
list
of
mitigating
factors.
there
was
only
a
single
list,
unitary
list,
of
factors
that
could
be
either
aggravating
or
mitigating,
depending
on
a
jury's
decision.
the
instruction
that
you're
referring
to,
your
honor,
was
a...
was
the
result
of
the
trial
court
denying
some,
and
granting
some,
parts
of
the
special
instructions
requested
by
the
defense.
and
so,
when
the
trial
court
said
to
the
jury,
"the
list
of
mitigating
factors
is
illustrative
only.
"
i...
we,
who
know
the
background
of
this,
understand
what...
the
point
he
was
trying
to
make,
but
the
jury,
hearing
it,
they
would
think,
very
reasonably,
"there's
no
list
of
mitigating
factors.
"
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
okay.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
that's
one
of
the
passages
that
i
am
referring
to,
and
it
came
as
a
direct
response
to
the
district
attorney,
in
effect,
calling
out
the
defense
attorney,
"i
can't
imagine
that
you
won't
be
told
that
this
fits
within
factor
(k).
"
so,
at
that
point,
the
defense
counsel
had
to
make
a
decision,
"okay,
either
i
have
to
argue
that
my
skipper
evidence
is...
my
square
peg
of
skipper
evidence
has
to
fit
in
the
round
hole
of--
"
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--(k)>
["]--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--your
honor,
this
court
has
used
the
terms
"extenuate"
and
"excuse"
as
synonyms
in
boyde
and--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--in
payton
with--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--no.
no.
the--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--that's
right.
and--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--then--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--your
honor,
the
whole
point
of
factor
(k)
is
that...
evidence
that's
an
excuse
for
the
crime.
and
if
we're--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--right.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
okay.
and,
your
honor,
looking
at
it
in
context,
given
the
district
attorney's
argument,
the
district
attorney
says,
"i
can't
imagine
you
won't
be
told
that
it
doesn't...
that
it...
that
it
doesn't
fit
within
factor
(k).
"
so,
the
defense
attorney
gets
up
and
says,
"i'm...
i
am
going
to
tell
you
that
it
doesn't
within...
fit
within
factor
(k).
"
"it
doesn't--
"
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--"constitute"--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--when
he...
when
he
says,
your
honor,
"it
doesn't
constitute
an
excuse
in
any
way.
"
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
"it
doesn't
excuse,
in
any
way.
"
your
honor.
and
we...
as
a
matter--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--of
semantics--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--okay.
your
honor,
this
is
a
point
of,
perhaps,
semantics.
but
the...
by
the
time
you
get
to
penalty
phase,
there's
nothing
to
excuse
the
crime,
in
the
sense
of
self-defense
or
"not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
"
the
only
thing--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--it
does
say
"in
any
way".
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
thank
you.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
thank
you.
and
if
the...
if
trial
counsel
was
trying
to
make
the
point
that,
"well,
it
doesn't
constitute
a
legal
excuse,
but
it
does
constitute
a
partial
excuse
or
some
kind
of
mitigating
evidence
under
this
factor.
"
he
would
have
put
that
in
there.
the
clear
import,
from
the
context
here,
is
that
defense
counsel
was
not
trying
to
sell
the
jury
a
position
that
was,
on
its
face,
untenable,
but,
rather,
to
acknowledge
that
it
did
not
fit
within
the
"excuse
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
"
factor,
which--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
your
honor,
there's
two...
i'd
like
to
make
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
used
those
terms
interchangeably,
in
boyde
and
payton,
with
respect
to
mitigating
evidence.
second
of
all,
let's...
as
a...
as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
a
defense
attorney
arguing
a
case
to
a
jury
in
a
central
valley
california
county.
and
if
the
defense
attorney
has
a
choice
between
two
synonyms,
one
which
is
used
in
common
parlance,
"excuse",
and
one
which
is
not
used
in
common
parlance,
"extenuate",
it
hardly
constitutes
an...
a
defect
or
concession
on
his
part
if
he
were
to
say,
"this
does
not
excuse
the
crime
in
any
way.
"
that's
plain
speaking
to
a
jury,
that...
and
what
he...
what
he...
counsel--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--your
honor,
not...
that's
not
exactly
what
happened
at
penalty
phase
here.
this
is
not
a
case
like
boyde,
where
all
the
evidence
was
background
and
character
evidence,
and
it's
not
a
case
like
payton,
where
the
only
evidence
was
a
post-crime
conversion.
this
case
involved
a
mixture
of
evidence,
where
first
there
was
the
grandfather
who
testified
to
what
a
bad
upbringing
he
had,
traditional
background
and
character
evidence.
the
mother
testified
to
her
undying
love
for
her
son,
traditional
evidence.
friends
testified
to
his
good
characteristics.
and
then,
at
the
end,
there
was
a
clear
segment
that
related
to
his
good
performance
in
youth
authority
and
his
religious
conversion.
so,
it
was
only
a...
it
was
a
partial
part
of...
partial
part
of
the
penalty-phase
presentation,
but
it
certainly
wasn't
the
entire
presentation,
as
it
was
in
boyde
and--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--payton.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
that's
a
very
logical,
sensible
thing
for
the
jury
to
have
thought.
and
now
i'd
like
to
drop
the
second
shoe
of
the
key
components
of
our
claim.
the
first
shoe
was
the
arguments
of
counsel
that
we've
discussed
the
various
permutations
on.
the
most
likely...
so,
the
jury
began
deliberating
based
on
the
instructions
and
the
arguments
that
they
had...
that
they
had
had.
and
it's
entirely
likely
that
when
the
jury
was
favoring
a
life
verdict
during
the
first
part
of
their
deliberations,
belmontes'
prospects
for
good
behavior
in
prison
and
contributions
were
part
of
the
debate.
when
juror
hern
asked
for
judicial
clarification...
not
clarification,
confirmation...
of
a
very
specific
view
that
only
the
enumerated
factors
could
be
considered
in
the
penalty-phase
deliberations,
the
jury...
and
the
trial
court
assented
without
qualification
to
that...
at
that
point,
the
jury
would
have
very
likely
thought,
"the
trial
court
who
holds
a
position
of
great
deference
to
us,
much
more
than
most
other
authority
figures
we
have
in
our
life,
just
told
us
what
the
marching
orders
are
here.
"
"this
is
the
framework
for
decision.
"
now,
what
happened
during
the...
during
the
trial
is
the
defense...
and
i'm
suggesting
what
the
jury
might
have
thought,
in
relation
to
your
question...
that,
"the
defense
attorney
was
taking
his
best
shot
for
his
client,
pushing
the
envelope,
maybe
went
over
the
top
a
little
bit.
"
"but
defense
attorneys
do
that.
"
"the
prosecutor
was
being
a
very
decent
stand-up
kind
of
person,
and...
but,
right
now,
when
we
get
down
to
the
business
of
making
the
decision,
we
have
to
follow
the
rules.
"
"and
the
rules
are
what
the...
are
what
the...
are
what
judge
gisson
just
confirmed
to
us,
that
we
are
limited
to
the
enumerated
factors,
and
factor
(k)
does
not
include
the
skipper
evidence,
because
that
was
explained
to
us
by
counsel.
"
i
would
like
to--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--your
honor,
i
don't
see...
as
to
the
first
part
of
your
honor's
question,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
new
rule
whatsoever
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
it's
a
straightforward
application
of
boyde
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
occurred.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
began
with
boyde,
and
it
went
through
all
of
the
proceedings
at
trial,
and
concluded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
didn't
consider
skipper
evidence.
and
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do,
the
exact
same...
applying
the
boyde
test
to
the
rule...
the
rule
of
decision
that
was
clearly
established
by
this
court
as
of
1986,
and
reiterated
and
expanded
by
this
court
in
1987,
with
skipper.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
certainly,
your
honor.
and
applying...
because
when
we...
when
we
take
a
look
at
penry
i,
this
court
said...
in
response
to
a
teague
argument
by
the
attorney
general,
this
court
held
that
penry
got
past
the
threshold
teague
issue
because
of...
at
the
time
of
the
finality
of
his
direct
appeal,
in
1986,
the
rule
was
well-established
that
the
sentencer
may
not
be
precluded
from
considering
relevant
evidence
in
mitigation,
by
lockett,
eddings,
and
others.
so
if
that
was
a
firmly
established
rule
as
of
1986--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--graham
v.
collins
was
an
aedpa
case,
as
was
payton.
so,
we
have
a
very,
very
different
standard
of
review.
and,
if
i
may,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--ah.
well,
the...
our
position
in
relation
to
that
is,
the
direct
quote
from...
direct
quote
from
payton
itself,
in
which
the
court
said
that,
assuming
the
california
supreme
court
was
incorrect,
payton,
nonetheless,
loses.
here
we're
arguing
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
incorrect,
and,
therefore,
belmontes--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--should
win.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
the
unusual
facts
of
this
case
are
much
stronger
in
favor
of
relief
under
the
boyde
test
than
were
those
in
payton.
therefore,
applying
the
longstanding
rule
of
lockett
and
eddings
to
the
different,
and
more
compelling,
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
no
reason...
there
is
every
reason
to
provide
belmontes
relief,
where
it
was
denied
to
payton.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
being
incorrect,
but
reasonable,
in...
to
presume,
or
find,
based
on
payton,
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
being
incorrect,
but
reasonable,
in
this
case.
penry
could
not
have
won
his
case
under
the...
under
the...
that
particular
analysis,
because
the
texas--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--supreme
court--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--and
payton
didn't
win
either,
but
we're
operating
under
the
prior
regime.
so...
i
understand
the...
the
court
is
suggesting,
i
believe,
that
somehow
payton
is
a
sword,
in
some
sense,
to
deny
relief
as
to
all
california
defendants
under
penalty-phase
instructional
claims
cited
by
the
california
supreme
court,
even
under
different
facts
and
under
more
egregious
circumstances.
and
i...
i
may
have...
be
misinterpreting
the
court's
argument,
but
i
would
argue
that
there
are
any
number
of
scenarios,
notwithstanding
payton,
that
would
require
relief
under
the
pre-aedpa
standards
when
you
apply
the
test
of
boyde
to
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
here
to
refight
the
battle
of
boyde.
you
know,
i
spilled
tons
of
hours
of
time
and
printer's
ink
in
an
amicus
brief
in
1989,
and
i
understand
the
concept
of
"you
lose".
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
boyde
test
should
be
applied
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
that
factor
(k),
standing
alone,
in
a...
in
a
case
where
defendant
relies
on
skipper
evidence,
does
not
warrant
relief
by
that
fact
alone.
here
we
have
much
more
than
that
fact
which,
under
boyde,
does
call
for
relief.
i
would
like
to
give--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--respondent's--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--the
"much
more"
includes
the
arguments
by
counsel,
which,
notwithstanding
different...
reasonably
differing
views
of
it,
does
put
a
context
on
the...
put
into
context
what
defense
counsel
was
arguing.
we
have
the
confusion
inherent
in
the
instruction
that
the
court
gave
the...
the
putatively
proper
instruction
about
them
being
illustrative
rather
than
exhaustive.
we
have
the
colloquy
during
the
penalty
deliberations.
we
have
juror
hailstone's
follow-up
question
regarding
the
possibility
of
considering
the
availability
of
psychiatric
treatment,
which
was
explicitly
rejected,
and
very
likely
confirming
the
message
that
had
just
been
given
to...
via
the
answer
to
juror
hern's
case,
that
only
the
enumerated
factors
can
be
considered.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
your
honor,
you
know
that,
because
you're
the
chief
justice,
but
the
people
of
san
joaquin
county
had
no
idea
that
that
was
the
reason,
and
if
not
explained--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
for
the
trial
court
to
say,
"you
can't
consider
that,
because.
"
--appended
exactly
the...
the
explanation
that
you
gave.
and
the
jurors
would
have
understood
that
they
had
to
consider
the
evidence
presented,
but
they
couldn't
speculate
about
other
things.
if,
at
the
crucial
point
in
the
proceedings,
the
trial
court
had
said,
"juror
hern,
you
do
have
to
pay
attention
to
those
factors,
but
they're
illustrative
rather
than
exhaustive,
and
you
must
consider
all
of
belmontes'
evidence.
"
"please
go
back
and
deliberate.
"
that
would
have
cured
the
errors
here.
however,
the
error
occurred
when
the...
when
the
court
didn't
do
that.
and
juror
hailstone's
question...
the
trial
court's
answer
could
only
have
reaffirmed
the
misimpression
that
the
court
returned
to
the...
to
deliberate
with.
i
have
a...
just
a
few
minutes,
and
i
would
like
to
give
respondent's
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
to
petitioner,
paraphrasing
somewhat,
how
does
skipper
evidence
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
and
the
answer
is,
it
doesn't
at
all,
logically,
ethically,
or
morally.
as
defense
counsel
conveyed
to
the
jury,
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
are
what
they
are,
and
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done
about
that.
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
are
immutable
and
irreparable.
the
only
thing
that
can
be
extenuated
in
a
penalty
presentation
is
petitioner's
culpability
for
the
crime.
and
counsel
argued
that
petitioner's
culpability
was
some...
to
some
extent,
extenuated
and
mitigated
because
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
no
plan
to
kill
the
decedent
when
they
went
to
her
house.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
well,
of--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--course--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--and,
your
honor,
this
pre
and
post-distinction,
i
don't
believe
has...
is
a
relevant
distinction.
it's
whether
it's
functionally
related
to
the
culpability
for
the
crime,
because
when
a
defendant
expresses
remorse--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--no,
your
honor.
it's
that
skipper
evidence
is
a
specific
and
different
kind
of
mitigating
character
evidence
that
doesn't
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
but
it
provides
a
different
kind
of
reason
for
sparing
the
defendant's
life.
there
is--
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
--well,
all
of
the
skipper
evidence
in
this
case
occurred
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact
before
the
capital
crime
and...
which,
in
fact,
gives
it's
much...
gives
it
much
more
weight,
because
it
can't
be
suggested
that
he
contrived
his
good
conduct
after
being
arrested
for
a
capital
crime.
but,
i'm
going
to
make
a
broad
statement
here.
there
is
no
reported
case
in
california
where
either
a
defense
attorney
or
the
california
supreme
court
makes
a
text-based
argument
that
skipper
evidence
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
because
it's
illogical
and
doesn't
work.
look
what
the
defense
attorney
did
in
payton.
he
argued
that,
"well,
of
course
you
have
to
consider
that
evidence
under
factor
(k),
because
it's
a
catchall.
"
"it's
supposed
to
be
inclusive.
"
that's
not
a
text-based
argument,
that's
a
circumstantial-evidence
kind
of...
kind
of
argument.
when
we
look
at
that...
when
we
look
at
that
phrasing
of
"extenuating
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
"
with
its
plain
meaning
in
english,
and
the
distinction
made,
in
skipper
itself,
that
skipper
evidence
does
not
relate
to
petitioner's
culpability
for
the
crime,
the
jury
is
going
to
appreciate
what
the...
what
the
attorney
said
to
them,
that
the...
that
the
youth
authority
religious
evidence
does
not
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
but
has
independent
mitigating
effect
outside
those
enumerated
factors.
there's
nothing...
that's
a
perfectly
appropriate
position
to
take,
no
constitutional
problem
there
until,
during
deliberations,
the
trial
court
confirmed
that
they
could
only
consider
the
enumerated
factors
and
could
not
consider
nonstatutory
mitigation,
the...
any
other
kind
of
mitigation,
because
that,
in
effect,
closed
out
consideration
of
the...
of
the
skipper
evidence.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
your
honor,
it's
like
being...
stepping
off
a
curb
and
being
hit
by
a
bicycle
that
you
didn't
see
coming.
this
occurs
in
the
middle
of
jury
deliberations.
nobody
expected
a
juror
to
ask
a
question
of
this
type.
and,
of
course,
i'm
speculating
here,
but
the
trial
court
fielded
the
questions,
responded
off-thecuff,
and
the
juror...
jury
went
back.
mr.
eric
s.
multhaup
one
could
also
have
expected
the
trial
court
to
say,
"let's
take
a
minute
to
think
about
that.
"
"we're
going
into
recess,
and
i'd
like
counsel's
opinion
about
this,
because
this
is
a
difficult
question.
"
"it's
not
a
simple
yes-or-no
answer.
"
