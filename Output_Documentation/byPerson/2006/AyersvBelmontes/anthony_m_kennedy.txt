justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
it
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
was
addressing
itself
to
the
fact...
to
the
words
of
the
factor
(k)
instruction.
how
does
post-crime
prison
conduct
reduce
the
seriousness
of
a
previous
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
it
has
to
relate
to
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
under
the
words
of
factor
(k),
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now,
do
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
have
an
instruction
that
supports
what
you've
just
told
us,
that
the
jury
is
told
they
have
to
make
a
single
moral
determination?
is
that
what
the
court
instructed
the
jury?
or
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--instructed
in
items
of
factor
(k)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
you
have
to
rest
on
your
argument,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
gravity
of
his
crime
"for
purposes
of
sentencing".
i
understand
that
argument.
but
then,
when
you
go
on
to
make
the
argument
you
just
made,
the
jury
understands
it
is
a
single
moral
judgment,
what...
is
there
some
specific
instruction
you
can
point
to,
other
than
the
factor
(k)
instruction
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
page--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--where
he
says
that
is
where?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but,
in
a
sense,
that's
right,
just
like
remorse.
remorse
doesn't
excuse
the
crime.
it's
a
consideration
that
you
take
into
account
in
assessing
the
gravity
of
the
crime
for
purposes
of
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--don't
you...
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
have
said
that
remorse
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
for
punishment
purposes,
under
factor
(k).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that...
and
that...
that's
post...
that's
post-crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
you
think
pre
and
crime...
pre
and
post-distinction
has
no
bearing
on
this
case?
i
thought
that
was
really
the
linchpin
of
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
third
time
the
court
has
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
particular
jury
instruction
formally
used,
is
no
longer
used
and
the
instruction
formerly
used
by
california
in
capital
cases.
the
case
concerns
the
jury
instruction
known
as
“factor
(k)”.
now,
the
previous
cases
in
this
court
addressing
factor
(k)
were
boyde
v.
california
and
brown
v.
payton.
in
payton
the
limiting
provisions
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
(aedpa)
applied
and
when
the
court
reviewed
the
“factor
(k)”
instruction
in
payton
and
referred
to
the
limitations
that
aedpa
imposes
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
the
court
in
payton
rejected
the
challenge
to
the
“factor
(k)”
instruction;
in
this
case
aedpa
does
not
apply.
hence,
it
was
argued
that
there
should
be
a
more
rigorous
review
here
and
the
factor
(k)
challenge
should
be
upheld
in
this
case.
it
is
true
that
aedpa
is
not
relevant
for
today’s
case;
still
however
we
find
much
of
the
reasoning
in
payton
and
in
the
earlier
case
boyde
v.
california
to
be
applicable
here.
we
find
no
constitutional
error
in
giving
the
instruction.
in
preparation
for
a
burglary
belmontes
armed
himself
with
a
steel
dumbbell
bar,
when
the
victim
saw
him
he
crushed
his
skull
with
it
killing
her
after
multiple
blows.
in
the
sentencing
phase
he
is
sought
to
convince
the
jury
that
his
religious
conversion
before
the
crime
tended
to
show
he
would
lead
a
productive
life
in
prison.
he
now
contains
that
this
and
other
arguments
about
his
chances
for
contributing
to
prison
life
could
not
be
given
full
effect
in
light
of
the
factor
(k)
instruction.
the
instruction
told
the
jury
to
consider,
“any
other
circumstance
which
extends
the
gravity
of
the
crime
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.”
that
was
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
for
evaluating
whether
belmontes
should
receive
the
death
penalty.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
applied
the
instruction
to
prevent
consideration
of
belmontes
mitigating
evidence.
as
in
the
two
previous
cases
we
hold
that
the
jury
was
not
prevented
from
considering
the
argument
that
future
good
conduct
would
tend
to
make
belmontes
less
deserving
of
the
death
penalty.
our
interpretation
of
factor
(k)
is
the
one
most
consistent
with
the
evidence
presented
to
the
jury;
the
party’s
closing
arguments
and
the
other
instruction
provided
by
the
trial
court.
we
concluded
its
improbably
with
the
juror’s
believe
that
the
parties
were
engaging
in
an
exercise
and
futility
when
respondent
presented
and
both
counsel
later
discussed
this
mitigating
evidence
in
open
court.
arguments
by
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
as
well
as
the
respondents
own
statement
assume
that
the
evidence
was
relevant.
other
instruction
from
the
trial
court
also
made
it
quite
impossible
that
the
jury
would
deem
itself
foreclosed
from
considering
the
respondent’s
full
case
in
mitigation.
the
judge
told
the
jury
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
evidence
of
course
included
respondent’s
forward
looking
mitigation
case.
the
short
contrast
between
the
courts
instruction
on
aggravation
that
only
enumerated
factors
could
be
considered
and
its
instruction
on
mitigation,
that
the
listed
factors
were
merely
examples
further
made
it
clear
that
the
jury
was
to
take
a
broad
view
of
the
mitigating
evidence.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
