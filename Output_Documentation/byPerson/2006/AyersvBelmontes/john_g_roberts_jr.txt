chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
ayers
versus
belmontes.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
what
they
were
told,
right?
they're
instructed
that
the
mitigating
circumstances,
including
factor
(k),
are
merely
examples,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
court,
in
payton,
said
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
evidence
of
remorse
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
so,
why
wouldn't
an
instruction
to
the
jury
along
the
lines
of
justice
stevens's
hypothetical
have
been
perfectly
constitutional
as
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime
that's
interpreted
in
brown
versus
payton?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
prosecutor
didn't
object
to
any
of
this
mitigating...
mitigation
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
defendant,
did
he?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
multhaup.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
does
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
does
that
matter?
because
the
jury
was
told
that
the
factors
were
merely--
examples
of
the
mitigating
evidence
they
could
consider.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
probably
didn't
fit
into
factor
(h),
either,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
move
on,
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--don't
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--don't
you
have
to
address
the
teague
question
a
little
bit?
you...
you're
entitled
to
this
new
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
only
if
it
was
dictated
by
precedent
at
the
time
the
judgment
became
final.
isn't
that
kind
of
a
hard
argument
to
make
in
light
of
our
subsequent
decision
in
brown
v.
payton?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
boyde?
it's
straightforward
application
of
boyde?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
penry
was
considerably
tightened
by
the
subsequent
decision
in
graham
versus
collins,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
payton
was
an
aedpa
case,
but
it,
nonetheless,
concluded
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
read
instruction
(k)
in
a
way
that
allowed
this
evidence
to
be
considered.
and
i
would
have
thought,
if
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
have
that
reading,
that
the
contrary
reading
that
you're
proposing,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
below,
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
dictated
by
existing
precedent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
if
it
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because,
even
if
incorrect,
it
was,
nonetheless,
reasonable.
and
i'm
just
having
trouble
understanding
how,
if
a
contrary
position
is
dictated
by
precedent
under
teague,
a
reading
180
degrees
the
opposite
of
that
could
be
regarded
by
this
court
as
reasonable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--graham
didn't
win
his
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
question
presented,
right?
the
reason
that
the
possibility
of
psychiatric
treatment
couldn't
be
considered
is
because
neither
party
had
put
evidence
on
that
question
before
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
it's
a
question
of
what
mitigating
evidence
was
put
before
the
jury.
the
jurors
couldn't
consider
that,
because
it
was
the...
quite
proper
for
the
trial
judge
to
say,
"you
can't
consider
that,
because
there
was
no
evidence
on
it.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
johnson,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
john
g.
roberts,

justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
05-493,
ayers
v.
belmontes.
