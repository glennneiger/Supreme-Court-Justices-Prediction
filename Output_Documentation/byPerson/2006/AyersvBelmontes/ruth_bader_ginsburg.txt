do
you
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
jury
in
this
very
case
understood
that,
given
the
questions
that
were
asked?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the...
what
actually
went
on?
i
mean,
the
jury
first
came
in
and
said,
"what
if
we
can't
decide?
"
"can
we
decide
by
majority?
"
and
then
the
question
was
asked,
that
seemed
to
indicate
the
jurors'
understanding,
that
we
take
all
those
factors
that
you
told
us
about,
and
we
just
take
those
factors
into
account.
and
there
were
clarifying
instructions
asked
by
the
defense
that
were
not
given.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--california
itself
recognized
that
there
was
a
problem
here
of
jury
confusion.
and
now
they
have
amended
the
provision
so
that
it
would
be
clear
to
any
juror.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
this
factor
(k)
come
from?
what
was
the
source
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
prosecutor's
closing
was
schizophrenic,
because
he
said,
"but
really
this
shouldn't
matter".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnson,
when
i
asked
you
about
the
derivation
of
factor
(k),
you
gave
me
a
california
statutory
cite,
but
is
there...
does
it
come
from
any
model
code?
does
any
other
state
have
such
a
provision?
how
widespread
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
states
have
an
instruction
that
talks
about
extenuating
the
circumstances
of
the
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which...
california
hasn't
had
it
since
1983,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
california
hasn't
used
this
instruction
since
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
is
this
a
one-of-a-kind
case?
i
mean,
you
said,
in
your
brief,
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
threatens
many
other
valid
california
death
judgments.
but
these
would
all
have
to
be
rather
ancient
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
wouldn't
wash
out,
on
the
other
grounds?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
a
jury
think
all
this
evidence
must
have
some
purpose?
the
only
purpose
it
could
have
is
to...
is
to
propel
us
toward
life
rather
than
death.
i
mean,
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
at
the
sentencing
phase...
wasn't
it
+/?
was
how
he
behaved
when
he
was
a
prisoner
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
so,
there
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
extensive
testimony
about
his
prospects
for
doing
good
in
a
prison
setting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
jury
must
have
thought
there's
some
reason
why
the
judge
allowed
that
evidence
in.
and
what
reason
could
it
be,
other
than
to
show
that,
if
he
is
given
life,
he
will
be
a
good
prisoner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
multhaup,
one
aspect
of
your
argument
i
wish
you
would
clarify,
and
that's
in
your
brief
at
page
20,
footnote
3.
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying...
you
are
not
challenging
factor...
the
factor
(k)
instruction
as
excluding
skipper
evidence.
your
challenge
is
limited
to
this
particular
case.
is
that
what
you're
saying
in
that
footnote?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
"much
more"
is
the
questions
that
the
jury
asked?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yours
is
both
pre
and
post...
that
is,
you're
referring
to
conduct
that
took
place
before
this
crime
was
committed...
that
is,
his
prior
incarceration...
and
asking
the
jury
to
project
that
forward
to
say,
"that's
how
he
behaved
in
prison,
before
he
committed
this
most
recent
crime,
and
that's
how
he's
likely
to
behave
again.
"
