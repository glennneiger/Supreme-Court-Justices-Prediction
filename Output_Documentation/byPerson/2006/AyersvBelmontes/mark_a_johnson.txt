mr.
mark
a.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutional
sufficiency
of
california's
catchall
factor
(k)
instruction,
which
was
given
in
the
penalty-phase
portion
of
california
capital
cases,
and
which
directed
the
jurors
to
consider
any
other
circumstance
that
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
instruction
violates
the
eighth
amendment
because
it
allegedly
misled
the
jurors
to
believe
they
could
not
consider
so-called
forward-looking
evidence
that
did
not
relate
directly
to
the
defendant's
actual
culpability
for
the
crime
itself.
in
the
state's
view,
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
is
fundamentally
flawed,
because
it
rests
on
an
illusory
distinction
between
different
forms
of
character
evidence
in
a
way
that
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
california...
or
boyde
versus
california
and
brown
versus
payton.
in
boyde,
this
court
addressed,
and
rejected,
a
virtually
identical
challenge
to
the
factor
(k),
and
concluded
that
this
instruction
did,
in
fact,
allow
jurors
to
consider
non-crime-related
evidence;
specifically,
it
allowed
the
jurors
to
consider
evidence
of
the
defendant's
background
and
character.
there
was
nothing
in
the
boyde
decision
to
support
the
ninth
circuit's
distinction
between
different
forms
of
character
evidence.
in
fact,
boyde
implicitly
acknowledged
that
the
factor
(k)
would,
in
fact,
be
understood
to
encompass
belmontes'
good
character
evidence,
in
this
case,
because,
for
all
practical
purposes,
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
nature
of
the
background
and
character
offered
in
boyde
and
the
nature
of
the
background--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
in
footnote
5,
this
court
addressed
a
contention,
raised
for
the
first
time
in
argument,
that
boyde's
evidence
might
be
admissible
under
skipper
versus
south
carolina,
and
this
court
distinguished
boyde
from
skipper,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
as
the...
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
the
evidence
in
this
case
related
to
good-character
evidence,
events
that
occurred
before
the
crime
itself,
unlike
in
skipper,
which
dealt
with
post-crime
events.
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
the
evidence
in
boyde...
his
dancing
achievement,
his
good
character
evidence
in
that
case...
was
not
offered
for
the
specific
inference
that
the
evidence
in
skipper
was
offered.
the
court,
in
footnote
5...
and
in
the
opinion,
in
general,
in
boyde...
nonetheless
found
that
this
evidence
did,
in
fact,
constitute
good...
character
evidence
of
the...
of
the
defendant's
present
good
character,
because
it
showed
that
his
crime
was
an
aberration
from
otherwise
good
character.
or,
as
justice
marshall
put
it
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
that
boyde
had
redeeming
qualities,
which
is
a
decidedly
forward-looking
consideration.
and,
as
i
was
saying,
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
in
boyde--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--yes
your
honor.
the...
and,
in
fact,
the
court
has,
in
franklin
versus
linite,
said
that
they
have
not
distinguished
between
different
forms
of
character
evidence.
and
i
understand
that,
in
the
past,
we've
always
discussed
background
and
character
evidence
as
sort
of
the
same
thing.
in
this
case,
however,
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
does,
in
fact,
rest
on
a
distinction
between
different
forms
of
backward-looking
and
forward-looking
character--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--evidence.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
it
does
not...
it
does
not
relate
to
the
seriousness
of
the...
of
the
crime
at
all.
the...
boyde's
dancing--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--it
would
relate
to
the
gravity...
to
circumstances
that
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
for
purposes
of
a
jury's
sentencing
determination.
and
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
that
point
is
this,
your
honor.
in
california,
jurors
are
well
aware
what
their
task
is
at
a
sentencing
determination.
in
california,
the
guilt
and
the
death
eligibility
determinations
are
made
during
the
guilt-phase
trial
and
the
jurors
are
expressly
told,
during
the
penalty-phase
trial,
that
their
lone
determination,
their
one
concern,
is
to
decide
between
a
sentence
of
death
or
a
sentence
of
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
and,
in
that
light,
the
jurors
are
very
well
aware
that
their
only
determination
in
a
california
case
is
to
make
a
moral,
normative
determination,
a
single
normal...
moral
normative
determination,
as
to
whether
this
man,
this
defendant
standing
before
them
in
this
court
today,
deserves
death
or
life
without
possibility--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--of
parole.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
no,
that's--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--the--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--no,
they
are...
and
i
may
have
been
misleading.
the
jurors
are
expressly
instructed
that
is...
that
it
is
their
duty
to
determine,
and
their
only
duty
to
determine,
whether
the
defendant
should
receive
life
or
death
and
parole,
and...
or
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole...
and
in--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--light
of
that
determination,
jurors,
naturally,
would
understand
that
they
could
take
into
account
anything
that
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
yes.
in
this...
yes.
in--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--it
would
have
been
constitutional,
to
the
extent
that
it
would
have
allowed
the
jurors
to
give
some
use
whatsoever
to
belmontes'
proffered
evidence
in
mitigation,
and
that's
what
this
court's
prior
cases
has...
and,
particularly,
the
various
texas
cases
have
said
that
jurors
must
be
given
an
avenue
to
make
use
of
the
evidence.
in
california--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--it
would
appear
to...
no.
it
would
appear
not
to
be,
because--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--it
would
have...
well,
it
would
foreclose
consideration
of
all
present
good-character
evidence,
i
believe.
it
would...
it
would
have
foreclosed
the
consideration
of
boyde's
evidence,
of
payton's
evidence.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
well,
the...
yes,
the
question
is
whether
the
jurors
would
reasonably
understand
the
instruction
to
preclude
the
consideration
of
constitutionally...
of
relevant
evidence.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
well,
to
the...
to
the
extent...
the
jurors
would
have
likely
understood
that,
it...
that
instruction
in
belmontes
and
in
payton,
to
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime
for
purposes
of
their
sentencing
determination--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--yes--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--that's
precisely
my
argument.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
well,
if...
and
i
apologize
if
i
was
misunderstood.
my--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--question--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
in
this...
in
this
case,
i...
there
is
certainly
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jurors
felt
precluded,
because,
as
was
previously
discussed,
first
there
was
this
additional
instruction
that
supplemented
the
other
instructions
in
this
case
that
made
it
very
clear
that
the
aggravating
factors,
the
various
factors
listed
in
the
standard
instruction
a
through
g,
that
those
were
the...
they
could
only
rely
on
those
two
for
aggravating
factors,
but
their
understanding
of
mitigating
factors
was
not
limited.
in
fact,
they
were
expressly
told
that
the
previous
factors
were
merely
examples.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
well,
there...
to
answer
your
questions,
your
honor,
first,
there
was
no
indication
at
this
conference
that
the
jurors
were,
in
fact,
confused
about
whether
they
could
consider
any
particular
evidence
as
being
mitigating.
the
conference
itself
was
called
to
address,
as
you
mentioned,
the
jurors'
concern...
or
the
jurors'
inquiry
about
the
result...
what
would
happen
if
they
couldn't
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
respectfully,
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
is--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--i'll
be
respectful
anyhow,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
yes.
the
point
is,
with
this
instruction
conference,
there...
the...
an
argument
that
this
reference
to
(k);
and
there
is
nothing
in
there...
in
any
of
these
questions
to
put
anybody
on
notice
that
that...
that
they
had
any
such
concerns.
and
first--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
stretch
at
all,
because
any
evidence
relating
to
the
defendant's
background
and
character,
his
present
character
in
court,
could
be
seen
as
extenuating
the
gravity
of
the
crime
for
sentencing
purposes.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
and
the
jurors--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
in
people
v.
easley
the
california--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--well,
they...
what
they
were
doing
was
certainly
a
prophylactic
measure
here,
to...
they
recognized
that
perhaps
there
might
be
some
concern
of
confusion,
and
so
they
wanted
to
forestall
any
chance
of
that
happening.
but
notably,
this
case
and...
this
case,
and
no
other
california
supreme
court
case,
has
found
that
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
the
pre-easley
version
of
it,
by
itself,
did
mislead
the
jurors.
in
fact,
the
supreme
court,
in
this
case,
came
down
7-0
in
support
of
the
conclusion
that
the
jurors
were
properly
told
about
the--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--the
factor
(k),
as
the
entire
standard
instruction
given
in
these
cases,
recites
verbatim
the
language
of
the
california
statute,
which
is
california
penal
code
section
190.3.
and,
interestingly
enough,
the...
not
only
the
california
supreme
court,
but
this
court,
implicitly
has...
have
both
said
that
not
only
the
california
statute,
but
the
instruction...
this
standard
instruction,
upon...
which
is
based
on
the
statute,
do
allow
consideration
of
all
relevant
mitigating
factors.
in
fact,
as
far
back
as
1983,
in
this
court's
california
v.
ramos
decision,
this
court
stated,
albeit
in
dicta,
that
the
factor
(k)...
or
that
the
standard
instruction
would
allow
consideration
of
background
and
character
evidence;
and,
in
fact,
the
court
stated,
in
footnote
20--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--okay.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
jurors
would...
even
if
that
instruction
were
given,
the
jurors
would
understand
that
an
instruction
that
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime
would
encompass
any
relevant
character
evidence.
and
this
court
has
made
these
determinations
all
the
time.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
that--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--no,
your
honor.
what
the...
what
the
counsel
actually
said
was
that
the
defendant's
religious
conversion
did
not
provide
an
excuse
for
the
crime
itself.
and,
in
fact,
that
argument
was,
itself,
echoing
the
language
of
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
which
of
course--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--directs
the
jurors
to
consider
any
other
circumstance
that
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
even
though
it's
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
and
so,
counsel
was
dovetailing
his
very
effective
argument
with
the...
with
the
instruction
itself.
and
what's
significant
here
is
that,
like
in
payton,
like
in
boyde,
this
case
involved
virtually
all
of
belmontes'
penalty-phase
evidence.
and
the
entire
main
thrust
of
his
argument
to
the
jury
was
that
he
could
not
make
it
on
the
outside,
but
he
could
fit
in
the
system
and
contribute
to
society
in
the
future,
if
given
a
chance
on
the
inside.
and
again,
as
was
true
in
boyde
and
payton--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--yes,
for
purposes
of
jurors...
at
jury's
sentencing
determination,
absolutely,
because
it
would
be
viewed
as
good-character
evidence,
precisely--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--yes,
your
honor,
because,
in
light
of
everything
that's
been
said
and
done
in
this
trial,
as
the
boyde
court
noted,
jurors
do
not
parse
instructions
for
subtle
shades
of
meaning;
they
understand
instructions
in
a
commonsense
manner,
and
in--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--the
prosecutor
objected
to
none
of
this
evidence.
and,
in
fact,
the
prosecutor,
in
closing
statement,
argued
that
the...
not
only
could
the
jurors
consider
belmontes'
forward-looking
prospects,
but
the
jurors
should
consider
those
prospects.
so,
in
this
case
what
we
have--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--he
acknowledged
it
was
something
that...
this
argument
was
something
that
was
proper
for
consideration,
but...
however,
he
argued
that
the
evidence
of
belmontes'
religious
conversion,
which
happens...
you
know,
and
then
lapsed
immediately
before
he
committed
the
murder,
in
this
case...
was
very
weak
evidence.
but
he
did,
nonetheless,
tell
the
jurors
that
they
could
consider
belmontes'
prior
character
as
bearing
on
his
present
character
now.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
he's...
yes,
the
prosecutor
first
stated
that
the
factor
(k)
was
a
catchall,
a
true
catchall.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
no,
your
honor,
because
in
the...
in
the
previous
page,
the
prosecutor
did
state
that
it
was
a
catchall,
you
know,
which,
by
implication,
incorporates
everything,
but...
and
the
prosecutor's
argument,
that,
"i'm
not
sure
if
it
fits
in
there.
"
signifies
that
there...
not
that
the
evidence...
that
such
evidence
could
not
be
considered
as
mitigating
as
a...
in
a
general
matter,
but
that...
just
that
the
religious
evidence
in
this
case
was
extremely
weak,
to
the
point
of
having,
as
a
practical
purpose,
no
mitigating
value.
the
prosecutor
followed
that
comment.
i'm
not
sure
it
fits
in
there,
in
next
breath,
with,
"it's"...
something
to
the
effect
of,
"it's
no
secret
that
belmontes'
religious
evidence
is
pretty
shaky
here.
"
and
went
on
to
conclude
that.
but
then,
in
the
next
breath,
he
said,
"but,
nonetheless,
this
is
something
that's
proper
for
you
to
consider.
"
and,
again,
reasonable
jurors,
hearing
this...
having
been
given
the
instruction
here...
would
reasonably
interpret
this...
all
of
this
evidence
as
something
they
could
use
to
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
and
particularly
in
this
context,
because,
like
in
boyde,
in
addition
to
this
factor
(k),
the
standard
instruction
directed
the
jurors
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
the
first
factor
of
the
enumerated
factors...
(a)
through
(g),
in
this
case...
told
the
jurors
that
they
should...
that
they
should
focus
on...
that
the
first
thing
to
consider
was
the...
or
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
itself.
the
final
factor,
therefore,
that
any
other
circumstance
that
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime
would
clearly
be
understood
to
relate
to
matters
outside
the
crime
itself.
and,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
ambiguity
about
the
meaning
of
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
argument
by
counsel,
the
additional
instruction
here,
clarified
that
to
the
point
that
there
is
certainly
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jurors
felt
that
they
were
constrained
in
considering
any
mitigating
evidence
in
any
way
they
thought
fit.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
of
the...
the
actual
wording
of
this
instruction?
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
i
know
that
this...
that
this
instruction
itself
came
from
the
statute,
which,
in
turn,
was
adopted
from
the
california
briggs
initiative
in
the
1978
statute.
i'm
not
aware
of
any...
of
any
other
states...
there
may
or
may
not
be...
who
have
adopted
the
same
statutory
model
that
california
has.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
after
people
v.
easely,
the
california
supreme
court
augmented
the
instruction.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
yes.
and,
unfortunately,
there's...
there
are
several
of
them
that
are
still
being
litigated.
i've
done
research
on
this
issue,
and,
as
of
this
date,
i
can't
give
you
an
actual...
an
absolute
number,
but
i
believe
there
is
approximately
15
cases
pending,
like
this
one,
that

this
factor
(k)
instruction...
that
involve
evidence
of...
somehow,
future-looking
evidence,
which...
all
character
evidence,
frankly,
is
future-looking--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--whereas--
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
--right,
that...
and...
that
are
still
pending,
and
that
are...
unlike
payton,
are
not
governed
by
the
aedpa.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
unfortunately,
there's...
they're...
i
believe
all
of
them
are
being
litigated
now
in
the
federal
court
system
in
california.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i
guess
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
a.
johnson
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
a
minute,
i'd
like
to
briefly
touch
on
the
teague
issue.
at
the
time
belmontes'
judgment
was
pending,
there
was
no
precedent
that
would
have
dictated
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
here
regarding
the
sufficiency
of
the
factor
(k)
instruction.
and,
indeed,
this
court's
subsequent
holdings,
in
boyde
and
payton,
bear
out
the
fact
that
it
was
at
least...
that
that
decision
certainly
was
not
dictated
by
precedent.
in
boyde,
this
court
dealt
with
evidence
of
good
character
that
was
precisely
the
same
as
the
evidence
of
good
character
here.
the...
belmontes'
evidence
of
having
succeeded
during
a
prior
commitment
and
religious
conversion,
that
he
might
be
able
to
help
others
in
the
future,
was
good-character
evidence
in
the
same
way
that
boyde's
evidence
of
having
won
a
dancing
prize,
of
having
helped
children,
of
having
helped
artistic...
having
artistic
abilities,
was
all
good
character.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
boyde
to
suggest
that
there
is
any
distinction.
but,
even
if
there
was,
it
would
not
be
one
that
would
compel
all
rational
jurists
to
distinguish
the
two
cases.
and
that's
further
buttressed,
of
course,
by
this
court's
more
recent
opinion
in
payton,
which
found
that
it
was
at
least
reasonable
for
the
state
court
to
conclude
that
payton's
post-crime
forward-looking
evidence
would
be
understood
to
fall
within
the
factor
(k)
instruction
if
it
was
at
least
reasonable
for
california
to
find
that
such
forward...
post-crime
forward-looking
evidence
would
fit
within
the
factor
(k).
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion,
to
the
contrary,
regarding
pre-crime
good-character
evidence,
certainly
was
not
dictated
by
precedent.
i'd
also
like
to
address,
quickly
in
my
remaining
time,
mr.
multhaup's
arguments
regarding
the
jury...
or
the
argument
of
counsel
and
the
jury
questions.
again,
boyde
counsels
that
the
relevant
consideration
is
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jurors
view
the
instructions
in
a
way
as
to
foreclose
consideration
of
constitutionally
relevant
evidence.
in
this
case,
both...
the
jurors
were
instructed
with
the
factor
(k).
as
i've
said,
they
were
given
the
supplemental
instruction
that
said
that
the...
that
the
previous
listing...
factors
were
only
examples
of
some.
and
then,
both
counsel
clearly
said
that
the
jurors
could,
and
should,
consider
this
evidence.
is
there
some
possibility
out
there
that
some
juror
might
have
misinterpreted
this
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
different
manner?
i
suppose
so,
but
there
is
certainly
no
reasonable
likelihood,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
belmontes'
evidence,
virtually
all
of
it,
was
directed
at
this
main
thrust
of
the
argument.
and,
just
like
in
payton
and
boyde,
for
the
jurors
to
have
believed
that
they
could
nonetheless
not
consider
that
evidence
would
have
turned
the
whole
proceedings
in
a
virtual
charade
or
a
pointless
exercise.
so
far
as
the
questions
during
juror
deliberations,
it's,
first,
important
to
recognize,
none
of
these
jurors
said
anything
to
suggest
that
they
were
actually
confused
about
whether
they
could
consider
any
evidence
offered.
their
question...
juror
hern's
question
merely
related
to
her...
she
wanted
to
confirm
her
understanding
about
the
role
of
balancing
mitigating
versus
aggravating
factors
under
california
law.
and
certainly
the
parties
there
if...
would
have
been
in
a
better
position
to
realize
it
if
these
questions
somehow
suggested
some
ambiguity.
there
was
no
objection
there.
moreover,
in
the
same
conference,
the
judge
advised
the
jurors
to
review
the
instructions
again,
which,
of
course,
again
included
the
factor
(k),
and
which,
of
course,
included
the
supplemental
instruction
that
said
that
their
consideration
of
mitigating
factors
was
not
limited
to
those
that
had
been
listed,
but
those
that
had
been
listed
were
merely
examples.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
submit
the
case.
