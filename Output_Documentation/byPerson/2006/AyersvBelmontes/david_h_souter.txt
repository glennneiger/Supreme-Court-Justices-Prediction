justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
why
they
had
the
conference,
but
they
got
into
the
colloquy
that
justice
ginsburg
described.
and
the
last...
as
i
recall,
the
last
reference
to
"factors",
whether
aggravating
or
mitigating,
was
simply
in
terms
of
the
list,
or
"the
listing",
i
guess
the
term
was,
so
that
the...
it
seems
to
me
at
least,
there's
a
fair
argument
on
the
other
side
of
this
case,
that
the
last
reference
that
the...
that
the
judge
made
to
the
jurors
with
respect
to
aggravation
or
mitigation
was
to
refer
to
a
listing.
the
listing
itself
didn't
have
anything
to
do,
as
i
understand
it,
with
the
instruction
that
you
are
not
limited
to
the
listed
mitigating
factors.
so,
the
concern
is
that,
because
the
last
reference
was
to
the
list,
that
the
list
included
factor
(k),
without
embellishment,
and
that
jurors
tend
to
give...
we
have
held
that
the
jurors
tend
to
give
the
greatest
emphasis
to
clarifying
instructions
or
later
instructions
in
response
to
questions.
isn't
it
a
pretty
good
argument
that,
in
this
case,
there
is...
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jurors
went
back
to
their
task
thinking
that
they
were
limited
to
the
list?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i'm
not
necessarily
saying
that's
my
position,
so
you
don't
have
to
be
respectful
to
me
about
it.
just--
justice
david
h.
souter
--knock
it
down
if
you
can.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
for
the
language
of
factor
(k)
itself.
and
if...
without
some
embellishment,
isn't
it
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
think
that
factor
(k)
goes
as
far
as
skipper
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
didn't
he
go
beyond
saying
it
was
weak?
he
did
say
that,
but
didn't
he
say
that
he
doubted
that
it
fit
within
(k)?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
prosecutor,
i
take
it,
would
have
answered
justice
stevens's
question
the
other
way.
the
prosecutor
would
have
said,
"well,
no,
this
probably
would
not
be
understood
by
the
jurors
to
refer
to
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
