it
doesn't
have
to
be
forward...
looking,
does
it?
i
mean,
i
thought
we've
said
"so
long
as
it
can
be
taken
into
account
in
any
manner.
"
whether
backward-looking
or
forward-looking.
haven't
we
said
that,
explicitly?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you
back
off
of
it,
and
you
say,
"extenuate
the
gravity"
of
the
crime
doesn't
relate
to
anything
that's
after
the
crime.
i
would
have...
i
would
have
interpreted
the
phrase
to
mean
"anything
that
justifies
you
in
giving
a
lesser
punishment
for
the
crime.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
should
have
been
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
be
respectful
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
they
thought
that
was
a
problem
of
ninth
circuit
confusion
rather
than
jury
confusion.
[laughter]
i
mean,
having
that
opinion
in
front
of
them,
you
would
think
they
would
amend
it,
of
course,
to
prevent
that
kind
of
decision
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
those
convictions
are
more
than...
more
than
23
years
old?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
on
page
9
of
your...
of
your
brief.
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--italicized
portion.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you
think
that
excusing
the
crime
and
extenuating
its
gravity
are
one
and
the
same
thing,
which
i
don't
really
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
has
to
be
clear
under
teague
is
not
just
the
rule,
but
the
rule's
application
in
circumstances
like
this.
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
that
are
clear,
but
if
teague
means
anything
at
all
it
has
to
mean
that
you
should
have
known
that,
in
this
case,
the
rule
would
produce
this
result.
so
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
there
was
a
rule.
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
out
there,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
outcome
should
have
been
clear
at
the
time.
isn't
that
what
teague
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
judge's
response
to
juror
hern
was
so
misleading,
why
didn't
counsel
object
to
it,
if
it
was
as
obviously
misleading
as
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
you
have
counsel
there,
to
help
the
court
when
the
court
makes
a
real
boo-boo,
and
if
this
was
as
obviously
error
as
you
say,
one
would
have
expected
some
objection
from
defense
counsel.
