when
did
the
defense
counsel
say
that
this
evidence
did
not
fit
within
factor
(k)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
said
this
case
is
different
because
both
counsel
told
the
jury
that
the
evidence
that
you're
relying
on
did
not
fit
within
factor
(k).
and
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
referring
to.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
as
to
defense
counsel,
are
you
referring
to
what
you
quoted
on
page
9
of
your
brief,
where
he
says,
"i'm
not
going
to
insult
you.
"
--what
you
highlighted
on
page
9...
"i'm
not
going
to
insult
you
by
telling
you
i
think
it
excuses,
in
any
way,
what
happened
here?
"
that's
what
you...
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
he--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--saying
something
very
different
there?
he
isn't...
he's
not
saying,
"this
doesn't
fit
within
factor
(k).
"
and
he
makes
no
reference
to
factor
(k).
he
says
nothing
about
"extenuating".
he
says
"excuses".
isn't
that
something
very
different,
"excusing"
the
crime?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
had
been--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
you
were
arguing
this
to
the
jury,
would
you
have
said,
"you
know,
my
client
earned
a
position
of
responsibility
on
the
fire
crew
that
patrolled
the
sierra
foothills,
and,
therefore,
that
excuses
the
crime
that
you've
found
that
he
committed
here?
"
