mr.
johnson,
would
you
comment
on
the
footnote
on
the...
on
the...
drawing
the
distinction
with
regard
to
the
dance
contest
that
the
defendant
won
in
that
case,
between...
it's
over
here;
i'm
asking
the
question...
between
facts
that
occurred
before
the
crime
and
facts
that
might
have
occurred
after.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
that?
this
case
is
unusual,
because
it
has
that
separate
instruction
that,
"the
mitigating
circumstances
are
merely
examples,
and
you
should
pay
careful
attention
to
those,
but
you
may...
but
you
may
rely
on
other
mitigating
circumstances.
"
may
i
ask
you,
would
it
have
been
constitutional
if
the
judge
had
added
a
sentence
at
the
end
of
that
instruction
which
said,
"however,
you
may
not
consider
anything
mitigating
unless
it
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
question.
would
it
have
been
a
constitutional
addition
to
that
instruction
to
say,
"but
i
want
to...
you
to
clearly
understand
that
it
is
not
to
be
considered
mitigating
unless
it
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
"
would
that
have
been
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
would
have
foreclosed
consideration
of
the
skipper-type
evidence,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
jury
might
have
understood
factor
(k)
to
limit
them
to
the
consideration
of
factors
that
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
johnson,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
you
answered
your...
you
stick
to
your
answer
on...
to
my
question,
earlier,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
you...
i
think
you
changed
your
answer
after
justice...
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
suggested
you
might
have
made
a
mistake.
are
you...
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
constitutional
to
instruct
the
jury
that,
"you
may
not
consider
any
evidence
mitigating,
unless
it
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
answer
consistent
with
the
position
of
defense
counsel,
who
said
he
would
not
insult
the
intelligence
of
the
jury
by
suggesting
to
them
that
the
religious
conversion
of
the
defendant
did
not
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
were
true
would
that
have
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
if
he
could
get
along
in
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
juries
would
clearly
understand
that
what
he
did
in
the
future
in
prison
would
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
on
166
of
the
joint
appendix.
