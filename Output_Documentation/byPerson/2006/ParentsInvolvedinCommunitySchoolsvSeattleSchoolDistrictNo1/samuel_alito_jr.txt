do
you
think
your,
do
you
think
your
schools
as
they
are
operated
now
are
segregated?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

how
do,
how
do
you
square
your
objective
of
achieving
racial
balance
with
your
disinterest
in
the
situation
at
cleveland
and
rainier
beach?
those
are
the
most
unbalanced
schools
under
your
definition,
and
yet
those
are
not
affected
at
all
by
this
plan.
why,
why
are
you
not
concerned
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
the
students
who
are
attending
those
schools
getting
the
benefits
of
attending
a
school
that's
racially
balanced?
and
if
they're
not,
why
are
you
not
concerned
about
that,
if
that's
an
important
objective
of
your
program?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
a
problem?
suppose
you
have
a
school
in
which
60
percent
of
the
students
are
either
of
asian
ancestry
or
latino
ancestry,
and
40
percent
are
white
as
you
classify
people.
and
there
are
no
african
american
students
at
all.
you
would
consider
that
to
be
a
racially
balanced
school,
would
you
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
the
theory
behind
that?
is,
the
theory
is
it
that
the
white
students
there
or
the
asian
students
or
the
latino
students
would
not
benefit
from
having
african
american
classmates?
it
is
enough
if
they
have
either
asian
classmates
or
latino
classmates
or
white
classmates?
how
do
you...
how
do
square
that
with
your,
your
objective
of
providing
benefits
that
flow
from
racial
balance?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
look
at
the
things
that
parents
are
concerned
about
when
they're
considering
where
their
children
are
going
to
high
school,
we
look
at
things
like
sat
scores,
for
example,
or
performance
on
statewide
tests,
would
we
see
that,
the
oversubscribed
schools
and
the
undersubscribed
schools
have
similar
test
scores?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
looked
at
garfield
and
cleveland,
what
would
we
find?
