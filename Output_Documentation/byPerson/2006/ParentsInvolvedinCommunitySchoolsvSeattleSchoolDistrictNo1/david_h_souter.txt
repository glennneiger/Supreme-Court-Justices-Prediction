justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
have
said
it
repeatedly
in
contexts
different
from
this.
i
mean,
the
paradigm
context
in
which
we
made
remarks
to
that
effect,
stated
that,
are
in
affirmative
action
cases.
the
point
of
the
affirmative
action
case
is
that
some
criterion
which
otherwise
would
be
the
appropriate
criterion
of
selection
is
being
displaced
by
a
racial
mix
criterion.
that
is
not
what
is
happening
here.
this
is
not
an
affirmative
action
case.
so
why
should
the
statements
that
have
been
made
in
these
entirely
different
contexts
necessarily
decide
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
help
you
out
by
taking
you
back
to
my
question.
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
affirmative
action
cases
was
the
displacement
of
some
other
otherwise
generally
acknowledged
relevant
criterion
such
as
ability
as
shown
in
test
scores,
grade
point
averages,
things
like
that;
and
that
was
a
characteristic
of
those
cases.
it
is
not
a
characteristic
of
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
state
justice
scalia
is
right,
you
are
assuming,
i
think
as
your
brief
assumes,
that
the
definition
of
the
benefit
to
be
received
here
is
the
active
choice,
not
the
provision
of
an
education.
now
the
active
choice
may
be
of
value.
i
do
not
suggest
that
it
is
not.
clearly
the
school
district
thinks
it
does
or
it
wouldn't
provide
choice.
but
it
is
not
the
entire
benefit
that
is
being
provided,
and
the
principal
benefit
is
the
education,
not
the
choice
of
schools.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
question
is
really
judge
boudin's
question.
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
by
siting
the
school
they
can
achieve
exactly
the
objective
they
are
seeking
here.
it's
a
question
of
do
the...
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
they
can
do
it
candidly
or
do
it
by
clumsier
means.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
an
unacceptable
basis
to
draw
a
constitutional
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
isn't
what
they
said
here.
i
mean,
they
were
dealing
with
a
zone
within
which
they
operated,
and
it
was
only
when
the
numbers
got
to
the
outer
limits
that
they
said,
okay,
we're
going
to
use
a
racial
criterion
to
prevent
anything
more,
any
more
extreme
disparity.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
they
do
when
they
site
the
school.
they
said,
you
know,
we'll
get
a
rough
whatever
it
is,
40-60
mix.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
