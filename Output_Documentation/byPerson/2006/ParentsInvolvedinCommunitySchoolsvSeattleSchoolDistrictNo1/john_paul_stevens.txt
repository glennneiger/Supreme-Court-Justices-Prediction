justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
brief
question
if
i
could.
does
the
record
tell
us,
the
300
people
who
have
failed
to
get
into
the
schools
they
wanted,
the
racial
composition
of
that
group?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
there
was
no
consideration
of
overall
educational
benefits
in
this
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
cleveland
school
that
justice
alito
mentioned?
an
i
correct
that
there
were
16
percent
whites
under
the
plan?
and
i'm
just
wondering
what
happened
to
it
during
the
last
couple
of
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was...
about
half
as
many
whites
as
there
were
under
the
plan.
