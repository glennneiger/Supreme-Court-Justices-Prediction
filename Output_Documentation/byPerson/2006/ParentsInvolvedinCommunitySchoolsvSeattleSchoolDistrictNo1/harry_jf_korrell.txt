mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
an
effort
to
achieve
its
desired
racial
balance
in
its
popular
high
schools,
the
seattle
school
district
denied
over
300
children,
both
white
and
minority
children,
admission
to
their
chosen
schools
solely
because
of
their
race
and
without
any
individualized
consideration.
this
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
equal
protection
clause
which
commands
that
government
treat
people
as
individuals,
not
simply
as
members
of
a
racial
class.
this
fundamental
equal
protection
principle
was
reiterated
in
grutter
and
in
gratz.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
not,
as
the
school
district
and
many
of
its
allies
suggest,
whether
integration
is
important
or
whether
desegregation
is
compelling.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
outside
of
the
remedial
context,
diversity
defined
as
the
school
district
does,
as
a
white/nonwhite
racial
balance,
can
be
a
compelling
interest
that
justifies
the
use
of
race
discrimination
in
high
school
admissions.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
kennedy,
we...
we
agree
mostly
with
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
might
take
a
different
position
on
whether
race
neutral
mechanisms
can
be
used
to
accomplish
race
specific
purposes.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
but
that's
not
an
issue
the
court
needs
to
reach
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
answer
turns
on
the
reason
that
the
schools
have
the
racial
compositions
that
they
do.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
if,
if
the
resulting...
if
the
racial
composition
of
those
schools
is
not
the
result
of
past
de
jure
segregation--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--in
that
case,
your
honor,
parents'
position
is
that
the
government
can't
be
in
the
position
of
deciding
what
the
right
racial
mix
is.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
obviously
it
is
not
the
facts
of
the
seattle
case.
in
the
hypothetical
your
honor
posits,
perhaps
the
right
analogy
is
something
similar
to
the,
a
redistricting
cases.
where
a
court
could
look
at
see
whether
the
racial
motive
was
a
predominant
factor
as
opposed
to--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--your
honor,
school
districts
can
do
many,
many
things
through
race
neutral
means
that
they
could
not
do
with
race
discrimination.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
ginsburg,
our
position
is
that
that
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
absent
past
discrimination.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
scalia,
our
objection
to
the
seattle
program
is
that
it
is
not
a
race
neutral
means.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
we
object
to
the...
if
that's
the
sole
goal
of
a
school
district
absent
past
discrimination,
we
object.
but
that
kind
of
hypothetical
situation
isn't
even
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
difficult
if
race...
if
racial
balance
can
be
a
goal
of
government,
then
it
is
more
difficult
to
defend
a
racial
balancing
plan
as
unconstitutional,
or
to
attack
one
as
constitutional.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
and
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
racial
balancing
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
souter,
we
disagree
that
the
analysis
in
the
grutter
and
gratz
cases
is
entirely
different
from
the
analysis
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
i
agree
that
this
court
has
not
had
a
case
like
this
before.
i
disagree,
however,
that
it's
not
like
the
grutter
or
the
gratz
decision.
the
plaintiff
in
gratz,
as
the
court
undoubtedly
is
aware,
attended
the
university
of
michigan
at
dearborn.
he
got
into
a
school.
he
didn't
get
into
the
school
that
he
wanted
to
go
to.
similarly,
in
our
case,
with
the
plaintiffs,
they
wanted
to
go
to
their
preferred
schools,
schools
that
the
school
district
acknowledges
provided
different
educational
opportunities,
produced
different
educational
outcomes,
and
they
were
preferable
to
the
parents
and
children
who
wanted
to
go.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
if
that's
what
affirmative
action
is,
your
honor,
then--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--your
honor,
perhaps
i
misspoke.
i
didn't
mean
to
accept
the
characterization
that
this
case
is
not
at
all--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--i'm
not
sure
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
school
district
admitted
in
the
response
to
request
for
admissions
that
had
the
identified
children
been
of
a
different
race,
they
would
have
been
admitted
into
the
schools.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
justice
scalia,
you're
right.
and
there's
another
criterion
which
i
think
is
getting
to
justice--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--your
honor,
they
are
both
benefits.
i
would
point
your
honor
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
gratz,
where
the
same
analysis
would
apply.
and
if
your
honor's
analysis
is
correct,
that
would
mean,
i
think,
that
the
gratz
case
would
have
been
decided
differently.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
we
have
several
responses.
the
first
is
that
the
premise
of
your
honor's
question
is
that
the
schools
are
in
essence
fungible
for
purposes
of
providing
a
high
school
education.
and
i
would
direct
your
honor
to
the
district
court
judge's
decision,
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
decision
in
which
she
acknowledged
that
the
schools
were
not
of
equal
quality,
that
they
provided
different
levels
of
education.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
there's
not
a
merit
selection
system
in--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
fundamental
command
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
that
government
treats
citizens
as
individuals,
not
as
members
of
a
racial
group.
and
that
command
i
don't
think
is
suspended
because
of
the
nature
of
a
school's
admissions
process.
that
right
is
still
possessed
by
the
individual
students,
and
if
a
student
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
an
individual
as
opposed
to
a
member
of
a
racial
group
at
a
university
level,
it's
parents'
position
they
are
entitled
to
that
same
protection
at
the
high
school
level.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
that
is
mostly
correct.
there
is
also
a
family
that
joined
the
parents
association
back
in
2000
that
has
a
child
in
seventh
grade,
that
will
be
approaching
high
school
by
the
time
this
court
decides
the
case.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
on
associational
standing
is
as
long
as
a
member
of
the
association
has
standing,
then
the
association
has
it.
we
submit
that
that
has
been
established
by
the
complaint,
the
interrogatory
responses,
and--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
cited
to
the
court
the
pannell
case,
the
associated
general
contractors
case,
and
roe
versus
wade,
all
of
which
look
at
postfiling
factors
to--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--you're
right,
your
honor,
none
of
those
were
class
action
cases.
pannell
and
associated
general
contractors
were
association
cases
much
like
this
one.
roe,
of
course,
was
individual
plaintiffs.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
it
does,
justice
stevens.
the
record
shows
that
100,
roughly
100
students
who
were
denied
admission
to
their
preferred
schools
were
nonwhite
and
roughly
200
who
were
denied
admission
were
white
students.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
were
some
questions
of
my
friend
mr.
madden
about
the
record
and
the
statistics
about
enrollment,
and
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention,
particularly
justice
breyer
and
justice
stevens'
questions
about
what
the
schools
look
like
now.
if
the
court
looks
at
pages
6
and
7
of
our
reply
brief,
we
provided
the
enrollment
data.
the
information
on
page
7
comes
from
the
school
district
website
that
provides
enrollment
data
at
the
individual
schools.
in
2005
and
2006,
enrollment
at
the
oversubscribed
schools
is
now
54
percent
non
white,
which
is
greater
than
it
was
under
the
district's--
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
--they
are,
your
honor,
but
they're
about
the
whole
school
after
four
years
of
operating
without
the
race
preference.
so
each
of
the
four
years
they're
represented
in
the
aggregate
shows
the
effect
that
i
think
your
honor
was
asking
about.
so,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
the
seattle
schools
are
richly
diverse.
it's
very
important
in
our
view
that
the
court
not
lose
site
of
that.
we've
talked
about
integration
and
segregation,
but
i
urge
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
data
the
petitioners
submit
regarding
the
actual
enrollment
in
those
schools.
a
couple
of
other
record
citations
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
justice
kennedy,
i
think,
asked
about
considering
race
as
a
last
resort.
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
the
school
district
looked
at
race
as
a
last
resort.
and
i
would
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
superintendent's
testimony
at
joint
appendix
224
and
25,
where
he
said
in
essence,
the
reason
we
didn't
consider
race
neutral
plans
is
because
we
were
interested
in
racial
diversity.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
i
think
the
numbers
that
you're
reading
are
from
the
difference
between
the
2000
and...
'99
and
the
2000
enrollments.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
the
numbers
i
was
trying
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
were
the
difference
between
the
enrollment
under
the
race
based
plan
and
the
enrollment
in
2005
and
2006,
which
shows
significant
and
continued
racial
diversity
in
seattle's
high
schools.
counsel
suggested
also
that
there
is
no
material
difference
among
the
five
oversubscribed
schools.
and
i
would
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
of
the
board
president
at
joint
appendix
261
to
274,
where
she
discusses
in
detail
the
programmatic
differences.
it
is
true
that
those
five
schools
were
oversubscribed
and
they
were
popular,
but
they
all
provide
unique
programs,
some
of
which
as
we
indicated
in
our
briefs,
required
children
to
meet
certain
prerequisites
to
be
able
to
attend.
mr.
harry
j.f.
korrell
your
honor,
i'm
perhaps
not
the
best
person
to
answer
that.
i
believe
the
board
has
been
trying
to
introduce
programs
at
all
of
its
schools
that
would
make
each
school
unique,
and
i
think
that
includes
the
undersubscribed
schools
as
well.
justice
breyer
asked
a
question
about
the...
about
the
process
of
this
litigation,
and
my
understanding
is
there
was
never
a
lawsuit
against
seattle
to
compel
desegregation,
that
they
were
always
following
a
plan.
