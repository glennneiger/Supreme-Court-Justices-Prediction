justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
that
the
point
that
justice
souter
is
trying
to
make,
as
i
understand
it,
is
of
course
there
is
a
similarity
with
gratz,
people
choose,
but
there's
a
big
difference.
the
similarity
in
grutter,
or
the
difference
in
grutter
and
gratz
is
that
you
had
a
prize,
a
school
that
was
supposed
to
be
better
than
others,
that
the
members
of
that
school,
the
faculty
and
the
administration
tried
to
make
it
better
than
others.
it
was
an
elite
merit
selection
academy.
and
if
you
put
the
black
person
in,
the
white
person
can't
get
the
benefit
of
that.
here
we
have
no
merit
selection
system.
merit
is
not
an
issue.
the
object
of
the
people
who
run
this
place
is
not
to
create
a
school
better
than
others,
it
is
to
equalize
the
schools.
that's
in
principle
and
in
practice,
if
you
look
at
the
numbers,
you
see
that
the
six
schools
that
were
at
the
top,
their
position
would
shift
radically
from
year
to
year,
preferences
was
about
equal
among
them.
they
have
the
same
curriculum,
they
have
similar
faculties,
and
i
don't
think
anyone
can
say
either
in
theory
or
in
practice,
that
one
of
these
schools
happened
to
be
like
that
prize
of
university
of
michigan,
a
merit
selection
system.
that,
i
think,
was
a
major
difference
that
he
was
getting
at,
why
is
this
not
the
same
kind
of
thing?
that
was
at
issue
in
grutter
and
gratz.
now
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
that
they
were.
what
i
said
was
that
the
object
of
the
school
board
and
the
administering
authority
was
to
make
them
roughly
equal.
i
said
that
in
terms
of
curriculum
and
faculty,
they're
about
roughly
equal.
and
in
terms
of
choice,
what
you
see
is
a
wide
variation
in
choice
by
those
who
want
to
go
as
to
which
is
their
preference
among
six
schools
over
a
period
of
five
years.
and
that
suggests
a
rough
effort
to
create
the
equality,
not
an
effort
as
in
michigan,
to
run
a
merit
selection
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now
the
question
is,
why
doesn't
that
fact
that
this
is
not
a
merit
selection
system
but
a
different
kind
of
thing,
a
sorting
system
or
a
system
designed
to
maintain
a
degree
of
integration,
why
doesn't
that
difference
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
while
you're
talking
about
the
way,
let
me
ask
a
practical
question.
35
years
ago
in
swann,
this
court
said
that
a
school
board,
particularly
an
elected
one...
it
didn't
say
that...
"could
well
conclude
that
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society
each
school
should
have
a
prescribed
ratio
of
negro
to
white
students
reflecting
the
proportion
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
"
far
more
radical
than
anything
that's
at
issue
here.
then
it
adds
"to
do
this
as
an
educational
policy
is
within
the
broad
discretionary
powers
of
school
authorities.
"
that's
what
this
court
said
35
years
ago.
thousands
of
school
districts
across
the
country,
we're
told,
have
relied
on
that
statement
in
an
opinion
to
try
to
bring
about
a
degree
of
integration.
you
can
answer
this
in
the
next
case
if
you
want.
so
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question,
of
course,
is
simply
this.
when
you
have
thousands
of
school
districts
relying
on
this
to
get
a
degree
of
integration
in
the
united
states
of
america,
what
are
you
telling
this
court
is
going
to
happen
when
we
start
suddenly
making...
departing
from
the
case?
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
it?
why?
why
practically?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
think,
was
is
this
basically
a
kind
of
last
resort?
or
how
close
to
a
last
resort
is
it?
what's
the
history
of
this?
i
thought
the
history
involved
a
lawsuit
to
desegregate
the
schools,
a
much
more
rigid
system
of
racial...
abuse
of
race.
ultimately
you
come
to
this.
now
you
stop
this.
and
what
happened
after
you
stopped
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
history
basically?
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
not
what
i'm
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
i'm
thinking
that,
i
thought
as
i
read
this,
and
you
have
to
correct
me
because
you
have
a
better
knowledge,
originally
the
schools
were
highly
segregated
in
fact.
people
brought
a
lawsuit.
then
to
stop
that
seattle
engaged
in
a
plan
that
really
bused
people
around
on
the
basis
of
race.
that
led
to
white
flight.
that
was
bad
for
the
schools.
they
then
tried
a
voluntary
choice
plan.
this
is
part
of
that
plan.
then
when
they
abandon
this
plan,
they
discover
more
segregation.
is
that
basically
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the...
as
i
gather,
the
plan
where
race
is
used,
has
to
do
only
with
the
ninth
grade.
and
therefore,
what
you
would
like
to
note
is
when
you
look
at
the
ninth
grade
after
they
stopped
using
any
racial
criteria
at
all,
what
happened
to
those
ninth
grade
classes.
did
they
become
more
heavily
separated
or
did
they
retain
their
diversity?
are
the
numbers
that
you
are
about
to
read
us,
which
i
have
in
front
of
me,
going
to
do
that?
tell
us
that?
i
think
they're
about
the
whole
school.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
numbers
i
have
here,
franklin
went
from
25
percent
white
to
12.7
percent.
roosevelt,
which
was
basically
a
white
school,
jumped
up
from
about
51
to
59.
ballard
jumped
up
from
about
56
to--
62.
then
garfield
went
down
some,
more
mixed.
but
those
were
the
worst
ones;
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
john
paul
stevens,
justice
david
souter,
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
dissent.
more
than
50-years
ago
this
court
declared
racial
segregation
in
public
schools
unlawful.
since
then
school
districts
using
many
different
plans
over
many
years
have
tried
to
integrate
their
public
schools.
louisville
and
seattle
are
two
such
districts.
they
began
with
racial
segregated
schools,
they
sought
remedies,
they
try,
forced
busing,
they
fear
or
experience
white
flight,
they
faced
concerns
about
de
facto
desegregation
and
they
ended
up
with
plans
that
end
forced
busing
that
rely
heavily
upon
student
choice.
in
both
cities
all
the
students
choose.
the
majority
indeed
almost
all
of
them
received
their
first
choice
school
but
school
districts
efforts
to
keep
school
racially
mixed
for
example
in
louisville
the
school
cannot
be
more
than
85%
white
somewhat
similar
in
seattle.
those
efforts
mean
that
some
students
do
not
receive
their
first
choice
though
in
seattle
such
a
student
can
transfer
to
a
preferred
school
after
a
year.
these
plans
are
not
primitive
action
plans.
school
placement
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
student’s
merits;
the
schools
here
are
not
magnet
schools.
they
are
about
equivalent
students
preferences
over
the
years
have
varied.
the
plans
here
were
adopted
democratically
by
school
board
in
order
to
achieve
certain
ends,
ends
that
are
partly
remedial,
partly
educational,
partly
civil.
until
today
the
law
has
allow
school
districts
to
implement
these
kinds
of
plans.
the
majority
is
wrong
when
it
holds
the
counter.
in
a
long
dissent
indeed
it’s
twice
as
long
as
any
i
have
written
before.
in
that
long
dissent
we
explain
law
and
it
is
long
because
details
are
necessary
to
understand
what’s
going
on
here
and
why
the
majority
is
wrong,
we
holds
its
unlawful.
first
i
examined
history
in
detail
and
that
history
shows
the
pattern
that
typical
pattern
i
just
described,
segregation,
remedial
plans
with
forced
busing
white
flight
re-segregation
concerns
and
new
plans.
indeed
they
chose
that
original
of
these
plans
were
segregated
by
law.
these
cities
in
fact
seattle
was
sue
and
entered
into
a
consent
decree,
sued
on
the
basis
of
the
school
board
memo
in
1956
that
said
the
reason
these
schools
are
segregated
in
part
is
because
we
have
transfer
plans
that
makes
black
children
go
to
one
place
and
white
to
another.
there
was
no
court
decree
neither
was
there
a
court
decree
in
large
portion
of
the
south.
a
lot
of
them
segregated
voluntarily,
desegregated
voluntarily
there
was
no
court
decree
but
they
were
segregated
de
jure.
there
was
a
court
decree
in
seattle
anyway
compared
to
earlier
plans
the
present
plans
rely
less
upon
race
they
emphasize
student
choice,
they
seek
to
improve
the
conditions
of
all
schools
for
all
students
no
matter
the
color
of
their
skin,
no
matter
where
they
happen
to
resolve
so
that’s
the
history.
second,
if
you
look
at
the
law
in
detail,
i
think
what
you
will
find
is
it
makes
clear
that
ever
since
brown
this
court
has
consistently
approved
the
measures
like
these
before
us.
indeed
it
has
approved
measures
that
were
far
more
race-conscious
to
combat
the
harmful
separation
in
the
schools.
consider
for
example
what
this
court
has
said
in
swann
v.
charlotte
mecklenburg
written
35-years
ago.
i
am
going
to
read
it,
it
is
a
paragraph
“school
authorities
are
traditionally
charged
with
broad
policy
to
formulate
and
implement
educational
policy”
and
might
well
conclude
for
example
that
in
order
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
pluralistic
society
each
school
should
have
a
prescribed
ratio
of
negro
to
white
students
reflecting
the
proportion
for
the
district
as
a
whole.
to
do
this
as
an
educational
policy
is
within
the
broad
discretionary
powers
of
school
authorities”
and
that
case
isn’t
below
that’s
why
the
opinion
is
long,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
like
that
it
was
a
principle
of
law
upon
which
executive
branch,
legislative
branch,
judiciable
branch
built
10-20-30
years
of
approval
of
similar
kinds
of
plan.
indeed
the
case
has
and
i
think
here
everyone
of
them,
everyone
of
them
recognize
that
there
is
a
critical
equal
protection
clause
distinction,
a
difference
between
on
the
one
hand
exclusionary
racial
discrimination
that
seeks
to
divide
us
and
justice
thurgood
marshall
use
to
say,
“that
the
constitution
in
respect
of
that
kind
of
plan
is
fatal
in
fact”
there
is
difference
between
that
kind
of
plan
and
an
inclusive
race
conscious
plan
that
seeks
to
bring
the
races
together.
our
cases
whatever
the
language,
whatever
the
linguistic
test
have
always
read
the
clause
as
not
being
fatal
in
fact
to
that
kind
of
plan,
the
kind
of
plan
that
tries
to
bring
people
together,
they
all
read
the
constitution
as
granting
school
districts
significant,
practical
lead
way
to
adapt
an
inclusive
point
should
districts
decide
in
their
discretion
that
such
a
plan
if
i
can
paraphrase
justice
marshall
again
will
help
our
children
began
to
learn
together
with
the
hope
that
our
people
will
learn
to
live
together.
third,
as
long
as
we
keep
in
mind
that
the
law
is
distinction
between
that
which
excludes
and
that
which
seeks
to
include
then
whatever
linguistic
test
we
apply
the
plans
here
pass
with
flying
colors.
do
we
have
to
find
a
compelling
interest,
which
is
language
taken
from
grutter
that
was
the
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
michigan’s
affirmative
action
plan
for
admission
of
the
law
school,
do
we
have
to
find
a
compelling
interest?
here
the
school
boards
objectives
the
interest
include
efforts
to
eradicate
the
remnants
of
primary
and
secondary
school
segregation.
they
include
efforts
to
create
school
environments
that
will
provide
better
educational
opportunities
for
all
children.
they
include
efforts
to
help
create
citizens
better
prepared
to
know,
to
understand
and
to
work
with
people
of
all
races
and
backgrounds
thereby
furthering
the
kind
of
democratic
government
our
constitution
foresees.
if
an
interest
that
combines
these
three
elements
remedial,
education,
civil
if
an
interest
to
combine
those
three
is
not
compelling
what
was
it?
do
you
we
have
to
find
that
the
board’s
plans
are
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
those
interests
after
that
grutter
said
that
affirmative
action
case
will
approve
the
plan.
well
here
the
plan’s
limited
and
diminishing
use
of
race,
the
plan’s
strong
reliance
upon
other
non-race
conscious
factors,
the
history
of
their
development,
the
comparison
with
earlier
plans
and
the
lack
of
reasonable
evident
alternatives
to
gather,
show
that
these
plans
are
more
narrowly
tailored,
they
are
narrowly
tailored,
more
settled
than
were
the
plans
that
the
court
upheld
in
grutter
and
other
earlier
cases.
let
me
deviate
so
i
can
give
an
example
the
majority
says
at
one
point
that
seattle
and
louisville
have
failed
to
try
less
race
conscious
alternatives
and
justice
kennedy
gives
a
list,
i
will
read
you
the
list,
what
they
could
have
tried.
strategic
site
selection
of
new
schools,
drawing
attendant
zones
with
general
recognition
of
the
demographics
of
neighborhoods,
allocating
resources
for
special
programs,
recruiting
students
and
faculty
in
a
targeted
fashion
and
tracking
enrolments,
performance
and
other
statistics
by
race.
take
these
one-by-one,
building
new
schools
that’s
called
strategic
site
selection.
seattle
has
built
one
new
high
school
in
the
last
44-years;
their
school
population
is
diminishing,
how
is
that
going
to
work?
let’s
try
another,
drawing
new
attendant
zones
on
a
racial
basis
they
tried
that,
they
tried
that
both
in
louisville
and
in
seattle
and
it
worked,
when
it
was
accompanied
by
forced
busing,
something
i
don’t
think
anyone
wants.
what
about
allocating
resources
for
special
programs,
what
i
think
that
means
is
magnate
schools,
well,
seattle
and
louisville
have
tried
that
too
and
they
are
still
trying
them
and
they
have
worked
with
degree
but
never
alone.
what
about
recruiting
faculty,
ask
the
school
administrator
about
how
easy
it
is
to
solve
this
problem
by
recruiting
faculty?
what
about
tracking
enrolments,
performance
and
other
statistics
by
race,
oh,
i
am
sorry,
tracking
measures
a
problem,
it
doesn’t
cure
a
problem.
the
upshot
is
that
in
striking
down
the
plans
--
these
plans,
the
court
forbids
or
it
dramatically
narrows
the
leeway
open
to
the
school
districts
to
use
race
conscious
plans
for
inclusive
reasons.
some
members
of
the
majority
would
outright
forbid
that
use,
it
would
treat
the
equal
protection
clause
is
colorblind.
other
members
of
the
majority
impart
through
what
they
say,
but
more
importantly
for
what
they
do
striking
down
this
plan
would
withdraw
the
practical
leeway
that
we
have
previously
said
or
at
least
radically
narrowed,
that
leeway
that
we
previously
said
the
constitution
offers
those
who
would
institute
inclusive
plans,
regardless,
their
interpretation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
would
prove
to
either
always
or
almost
always
or
certainly
far
too
often
fatal
in
fact,
that’s
the
exclusive
variety,
fatal
in
fact
to
districts
who
seek
to
use
race
conscious
means
for
inclusive
ends.
fourth,
the
consequences,
race
related
controversy
at
school
districts
and
others
seek
to
unravel
the
meaning
of
today’s
several
opinions.
delay,
setback
in
bringing
about
racially
diverse
schools,
trying
to
deal
with
threats
of
de
facto
segregation,
trying
to
unify
education
in
communities
divided
by
poverty,
correlated
with
race,
these
consequences
are
serious.
the
conclusion
of
all
this
is
simple,
yesterday,
the
plans
under
review
were
lawful,
today,
they
are
not.
yesterday,
the
citizens
of
this
nation
could
look
for
guidance
to
this
court’s
unanimous
pronouncements
concerning
desegregation,
today,
they
cannot.
yesterday,
school
boards
had
available
to
them
a
full
range
of
means
to
combat

they
do

and
there
is
more.
what
has
happened
to
starry
decisis?
the
history
of
the
plans
before
us,
their
educational
importance,
their
highly
limiting
use
of
race
all
these
and
more
makes
clear
that
the
compelling
interest
here
is
stronger
than
in
for
example
grutter
or
we
upheld
the
race
conscious

school
admissions
program.
they
are
more
narrowly
tailored
and
what
has
happened
to
all
those
cases
that
made
very
clear
that
in
the
context
of
a
k-12
public

this
kind
of
program
is
constitutionally
permissible.

1,
the
pluralities
logic
writes
these
cases
out
of
the
law.
it
is
not
awful
in
the
law,
it’s
so
few
of
so
quick
change
so
much.
what
of
respect
for
democratic
local
decision
making
by
states
and
school
boards,
for
several
decades
this
court
has
rested
its
public
school
decision
upon
swann’s
basic
view
that
the
constitution
grants
local
school
districts
a
significant
degree
of
leeway
where
the
inclusive
use
of
race-conscious
criteria
is
at
issue.
now
localities
will
have
to
cope
with
the
difficult
problems
they
face
including
a
de
facto
re-segregation
deprived
of
one
important
means
they
thought
would
help,
and
what
of
law’s
concern
to
diminish
and
peacefully
settle
conflict
among
the
nation’s
people?
instead
of
accommodating
different
good-faith
visions
of
our
country
and
our
constitution,
today’s
holding
upset
settled
expectations,
creates
legal
uncertainty,
and
threatens
to
produce
considerable
further
litigation,
aggravating
race
related
conflict,
difficult
problems
surround
race
relations
in
this
country.
the
people
of
this
nation
hold
in
good
faith
different
views
on
how
best
to
address
those
problems.
the
plurality
may
question
the
wisdom
of
the
district’s
approach
towards
improving
race
relations
in
the
public
schools
but
the
14
members
of
the
school
boards
in
seattle
and
louisville
hold
a
different
view
about
that,
about
how
to
include
children
of
all
races.
they
believe
that
their
way
will
work
better
to
bring
about
racial
inclusion
in
their
own
communities;
they
don’t
seek
to
impose
that
way
upon
other
communities.
the
constitution
does
not
dictate
a
single
answer
to
this
kind
of
question
rather
it
grant
citizens
considerable
freedom
to
debate
and
develop
solutions
for
themselves
and
this
court
should
leave
them
free
to
do
just
that,
and
what
about
the
long
history
and
moral
vision
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
embodies.
the
plurality
cites
in
support
those
who
argued
in
brown
against
segregation
and
some
compare
the
approach
i
have
taken
to
that
of
segregation’s
defenders,
but
historic
these
segregations
did
not
simply
tell
schoolchildren
as
the
plurality
suggest
“where
they
could
and
could
not
go
to
school
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin”
that
wasn’t
all
what
was
happening,
that
wasn’t
what
segregation
just
was.
it
was
about
a
caste
system
rooted
in
the
institutions
of
slavery
and
80-years
of
legalized
subordination.
the
history’s
lesson
is
not
that
efforts
to
continue
racial
segregation
are
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
efforts
to
achieve
racial
integration
and
it
is
a
cruel
distortion
of
that
history
to
compare
topeka,
kansas,
in
the
1950’s
louisville
and
seattle
in
the
modern
day,
to
equate
the
plight
of
linda
brown
who
was
ordered
to
attained
the
jim
crow
school
to
the
circumstances
a
petitioner
joshua
mcdonald
whose
transfer
request
to
a
school
closer
to
home
was
indeed
initially
declined,
let
alone
the
seattle
student
who
has
to
spent
a
single
year
at
a
school
he
doesn’t
prefer.
i
am
not
saying
there
is
nothing
policy
speaking
but
the
problem
of
choosing
everyone
by
race.
there
is
a
cost
in
applying
a
state-mandated
racial
label.
there
are
many
cost
listed
in
the
majority
and
pluralities
opinions,
but
i
am
saying
that
those
costs
do
not
approach
in
degree
or
in
kind,
the
terrible
harms
of
slavery,
the
resulting
caste
system
and
80-years
of
racial
segregation.
finally,
what
of
the
hope
and
promise
of
brown?
for
much
of
this
nations
history
the
races
remained
divided.
it
wasn’t
that
long
ago
that
people
of
different
races
drank
from
separate
fountains,
rode
on
separate
buses,
studied
in
separate
schools.
in
this
court’s
finest
hour,
brown
vs.
board
of
education
challenged
that
history
and
helped
to
change
it.
for
brown
held
out
a
promise,
it
was
a
promise
embodied
in
three
amendments
designed
to
make
citizens
of
former
slaves.
it
was
the
promise
of
true
racial
equality,
not
as
a
matter
of
fine
words
on
paper,
but
as
a
matter
of
everyday
life
the
nation’s
citizens
and
schools.
it
was
about
the
nature
of
democracy
that
must
work
for
all
americans.
it
sought
one
law,
one
nation,
one
people,
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
legal
principle
but
in
terms
of
how
we
actually
live
our
lives.
not
everyone
welcomed
that
decision,
three
years
after
it
governor
of
arkansas
ordered
state
militia
to
block
the
doors
of
a
white

so
that
black
school
children
could
not
enter.

the
united
states
dispatched
the

and
federal
troops
were
needed
to
enforce
that
desegregation
decree.
today,
almost
50-years
later,
attitudes
towards
race
in
this
nation
have
changed
dramatically.
no
airborne

many
parents
white
and
black
alike,
maybe
almost
all
alike
want
their
children
to
attained
schools
with
children
of
different
races.
indeed
the
very
school
districts
that
once
spurned
integration
now
strive
for
it.
the
long
history
of
their
efforts
reveals
the
complexity
and
difficulties
they
have
faced.
and
in
light
of
those
challenge
they
here
ask
us
not
to
take
from
their
hands
the
instruments
that
they
have
used
to
rid
their
schools
racial
segregation
instruments
that
they
believe
are
still
necessary
to
overcome
the
problems
of
cities
that
are
divided
by
race
and
poverty.
plurality
would
decline
their
modest
request.
the
plurality
is
wrong
to
do
that.
last
half-century
has
witnessed
great
strides
towards
racial
equality.
we
have
not
yet
realized
the
promise
of
brown.
to
invalidate
the
plans
under
review
here
is
to
threaten
the
promise
of
brown.
the
plurality’s
position
not
intended
that
i
fear
would
break
that
promise.
this
is
a
decision
that
the
court
and
the
nation
will
come
to
regret,
i
must
dissent.
