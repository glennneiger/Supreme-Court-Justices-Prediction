mr.
korrell--
justice
ruth
bader

--but
can
they
have
a
race
conscious
objective?
i
think
that
that's
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
is
asking
you,
and
i
don't
get
a
clear
answer.
you
say
you
can't
use
a
racial
means.
but
can
you
have
a
racial
objective?
that
is,
you
want
to
achieve
balance
in
the
schools.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
to
agree
that
those
cases
left
someone
out
of
the
picture
entirely
so
we
were
talking
about
a
selection
of
one
person
or
another?
the
word
"sorting"
has
been
used
in
this
context
because
everybody
gets
to
go
to
school.
indeed,
they
are
required
to
go
to
school.
so
no
one
gets
left
out
of
the
system,
and
i
think
there
have
been
court
of
appeals
judges
who
have
noted.
we
have
never
had
that
case
before,
it's
not
like
the
affirmative
action
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
korrell,
before
your
time
runs
out,
i
did
want
to
clarify
something
about
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
here.
do
i
understand
correctly
that
none
of
the
parents
who
originally
brought
this
lawsuit
have
children
who
are
now
preninth
grade,
but
that
newcomers,
people
who
recently
joined,
do
have
children
of
preninth
grade
age?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
dispute
that
membership,
for
standing
purposes,
the
membership
is
what
counts,
not
the
association
but
the
members?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
is
a
member,
jurisdictional
questions
generally,
don't
we
go
by
what
the
membership
was
when
the
complaint
was
filed
and
not
what
it
has
become
in
the
course
of
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
transaction
case
situation
is
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
was
faculty,
and
the
school
district
makes
a
deliberate
effort
to
have
members
of
the
white
race
and
members
of
other
races
represented
in...
on
the
faculty
of
every
school,
so
you
won't
have
one
school
with
all
white
teachers,
so
that
you'll
have
a
mix,
and
that's
quite
explicit.
that's
their
objective
and
they're
using
a
racial
criterion
to
get
there.
would
that
be
impermissible,
to
have
a
mix
of
teachers
in
all
the
schools?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would
be
okay?
how
would
you
get
there
other
than
having...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
has
been
made
by
others.
let
me
read
from
judge
boudin's
decision.
he
says
"the
choice
is
between
openly
using
race
as
a
criterion
or
concealing
it
through
some
clumsy
or
proxy
device.
"
if
you
want
to
have
an
integrated
school
and
you
site
the
schools
deliberately
to
achieve
that
objective,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
see
how
you
can
have
a
racial
objective
but
a
nonracial
means
to
get
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
madden,
there
was
a
question
raised
about
your
categories,
that
is,
you
have
white
and
then
everything
else.
and
it
was
suggested
that
if
you
are
looking
for
diversity,
what
was...
the
schools
that
you
just
mentioned
had
a
large
percentage
of
asian
americans,
but
they
don't
count.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
that
individual
treatment
makes
no
sense
in
terms
of
the
objective
here.
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
question
of
integration,
whether
there
was
any
use
of
a
racial
criterion,
whether
integration,
using
racial
integration
is
the
same
as
segregation,
it
seems
to
me
is
pretty
far
from
the
kind
of
headlines
that
attended
the
brown
decision.
they
were,
at
last,
white
and
black
children
together
on
the
same
school
bench.
that
seems
to
be
worlds
apart
from
saying
we'll
separate
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
the
board
simultaneously
trying
to
introduce
similar
programs
or
attractive
programs
in
the
undersubscribed
schools?
