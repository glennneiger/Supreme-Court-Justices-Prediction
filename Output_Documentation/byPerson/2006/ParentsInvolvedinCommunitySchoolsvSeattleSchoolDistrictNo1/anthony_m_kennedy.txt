do
you

do
you
agree
in
general
with
the
brief
submitted
by
the
government
or
do
you
have
differences
with
it
in
its
approach?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it,
it
is
a
point
that
i,
i'd
like
both
him
and
you
to
discuss
at
some
point
during
your
argument.
if...
can
you
use
race
for
site
selection?
when
you
have,
you
need
to
build
a
new
school.
there
are
three
sites.
one
of
them
would
be
all
one
race.
site
two
would
be
all
the
other
race.
site
three
would
be
a
diversity
of
races.
can
the
school
board
with,
with
the
intent
to
have
diversity
pick
site
number
3?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
there's...
well,
we
can
have
all
kinds
of
different
hypotheticals,
but
there's
residential
housing
segregation,
and
it
wants,
it
wants,
the
board
wants
to
have
diversity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it
is
a
new
school.
it's
a
new
school.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it'd
have
to
take
the
three
sites,
all
of
them
in
the
hypothetical,
all
of
them
equal,
and
just
flip
a
coin,
because
otherwise
it
would
be
using
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no.
the
school
board
says
we
want,
right
up
front,
we
want
racial
diversity
in
our
new
schools.
illicit
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
you
but
it
might
be
necessary
for
us
when
we
write
the
case.
we're
not
writing
just
on
a
very
fact
specific
issue.
of
course,
the
followup
question,
and
the
solicitor
general
can
address
it
too,
is
this,
assuming
some
race
conscious
measures
are
permissible
to
have
diversity,
isn't
it
odd
to
say
you
can't
use
race
as
a
means?
i
mean,
that's
the
next
question.
that
may,
in
fact,
be
why
you
give
the...
seem
to
give
the
answer
that
you
do.
you
just
don't
want
to
embrace
that
contradiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
you
do
with
strategic
site
selection
in
order
to
create
racial
diversity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
the
expressed
and
principal
purpose.
you
know
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
page
7
of
your
brief
you
say
"school
districts
have
an
unquestioned
interest
in
reducing
minority
isolation.
"
if
i
put
a
period
in
there,
then
i
would
get
to
my
strategic
site
selection,
and
i
still
haven't
got
your
answer
on
that.
you
don't
put
a
period
there.
you
say
"have
an
unquestioned
interest
in
reducing
minority
isolation
through
race
neutral
means.
"
and
this
brings
up
this
same
question
justice
ginsburg
had.
isn't
it
odd
jurisprudence
where
we
have
an
objective
that
we
state
in
one
set
of
terms
but
a
means
for
achieving
it
in
another
set
of
terms,
unless
your
answer
is
that
individual
classification
by
race
is,
is
impermissible,
but
other,
more
broad
measures
based
on,
with
a
racial
purpose
are
all
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
answer
to
my
strategic
site
selection
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
let
me
change
justice--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
my
slight
modification
of
justice
scalia's
hypothetical...
and
it
proceeds
on
the
same
theory...
is
suppose
there's
a
huge
demand
for
housing.
a
developer
has
a
plan
to
build
500
units.
can
the
city
say,
we'll
grant
you
the
permit
on
the
ground,
on
the
condition
that
30
percent
of
all
the
houses
go
to
minorities?
that
means
people
will
live
together.
then
we
can
have
a
school,
a
school
that
can
be
diverse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
system
is
the
one
that
gives
a
choice
to
the
individuals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
grutter
we
said,
to
shorten
it
just
a
little
bit,
at
page
329-330
of
the--
u.s.
reports,
539,
"the
law
school's
interest
is
not
simply
to
assure
within
its
student
body
some
specified
percentage
of
a
particular
group
because
of
race.
"
"that
would
amount
to
outright
racial
balancing
which
is
patently
unconstitutional.
"
and
that
seems
to
be
what
you
have
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
problem
is
that
unlike
strategic
siting,
magnet
schools,
special
resources,
special
programs
in
some
schools,
you're
characterizing
each
student
by
reason
of
the
color
of
his
or
her
skin.
that
is
quite
a
different
means.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
should
only
be,
if
ever
allowed,
allowed
as
a
last
resort.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
alito
and
justice
breyer
and
i
myself
am
interested
can
you
tell
us
what
has
happened
since
the
plan's
been
enjoined?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
have
you
gone
back
to
square
one?
and
it's
just,
there's
no
diversity
at
all?
or
is
there
substantially
more
diversity?
can
you
tell
us
about
that?
because
it's
important.
it
may
mean
that
you
don't
need
to
identify
students
by
the
color
of
their
skin
in
assignment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
everybody
gets
into
a
school,
it
seems
to
me
is
misplaced,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
can
get
into
the
school
that
you
really
prefer.
and
that
in
some
cases
depends
solely
on
skin
color.
you
know,
it's
like
saying
everybody
can
have
a
meal
but
only
people
with
separate
skin
can
get
the
dessert.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated
i
have
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
it
seems
appropriate
to
summarize
that
opinion
very
briefly.
the
nation’s
schools
strive
to
teach
that
our
strength
comes
from
people
of
different
races,
creeds,
and
cultures
uniting
in
commitment
to
the
freedom
of
all.
in
these
cases
two
school
districts
in
different
parts
of
the
country
seek
to
teach
that
principle
by
having
classrooms
that
reflect
the
racial
makeup
of
the
surrounding
community.
that
the
school
districts
consider
these
plans
to
be
necessary
should
remind
us
our
highest
aspirations
are
yet
unfulfilled.
but
the
solutions
mandated
by
these
school
districts
must
themselves
be
lawful.
it
is
well
established
that
when
a
government
policy
is
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
that
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
racial
classifications
are
narrowly
tailored
measures
that
further
compelling
governmental
interest
that
jefferson
county
in
its
briefing
has
explained
how
and
when
it
employs
these
classifications
only
in
terms
so
broad
and
imprecise
that
they
cannot
withstand
strict
scrutiny.
it
fails
to
make
clear
for
example,
who
makes
the
decisions?
what
if
any
oversight
is
employed;
the
precise
circumstances
in
which
an
assignment
decision
will
or
will
not
made
on
the
basis
of
race
or
how
it
is
determined
which
of
two
similarly
situated
children
will
be
subjected
to
a
given
race-based
decision.
when
a
court
subjects
governmental
action
to
strict
scrutiny
it
cannot
construe
ambiguities
in
favor
of
the
government.
as
for
the
seattle
case
the
school
district
has
failed
to
explain
why
in
a
district
compose
of
a
diversity
races
with
only
a
minority
of
the
students
classified
as
“white”,
it
is
employed
the
crude
racial
categories
of
white
and
non-white
as
the
basis
for
its
assignment
decision.
far
from
being
narrowly
tailored
towards
purpose
this
system
threatens
to
defeat
its
own
ends.
the
school
district
has
provided
no
convincing
explanation
for
the
design
of
the
classifications.
for
these
reasons
i
concur
in
parts
i,
ii,
iii-a
and
iii-c
of
the
court’s
opinion.
my
further
respectful
submission
however
is
that
parts
of
the
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
imply
on
all
two
unyielding
insistence
that
race
cannot
be
a
factor
in
instances
when
in
my
view
it
may
be
taken
into
account.
the
plurality
opinion
is
too
dismissive
of
the
legitimate
interest
government
has
in
ensuring
all
people
have
equal
opportunity
regardless
of
their
race.
the
plurality
opinion
is
at
least
open
to
the
interpretation
that
the
constitution
requires
school
districts
to
ignore
the
problems
of
de
facto
desegregation
in
schooling
and
i
cannot
endorse
that
conclusion.
if
school
authorities
are
concerned
that
the
student-body
compositions
of
certain
schools
interfere
with
the
objective
of
offering
an
equal
educational
opportunity
to
all
of
their
students
they
are
free
to
devise
race-conscious
measures
to
address
the
problem
in
a
general
way
and
without
treating
each
student
in
different
fashion
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
systematic,
individual
typing
by
race.
now
the
descent
on
the
other
hand
rest
on
the
assumptions
that
these
sweeping
race
base
classifications
of
persons
are
permitted
by
existing
precedents
and
that
its
own
confident
endorsement
of
race
categories
for
each
child
in
a
large
segment
of
the
community
presents
no
danger
to
individual
freedom
in
other
prospective
realms
of
government
regulation
and
that
the
racial
classification
used
here
cause
no
hurt
or
anger
of
the
types
of
the
constitution
prevents
in
each
of
these
premises,
in
my
respectful
view,
is
incorrect.
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
a
dissent
rational
were
accepted,
congress,
assuming
an
otherwise
proper
exercise
of
its
spending
power
or
its
authority,
or
its
commerce
power
could
mandate
either
the
seattle
or
the
jefferson
county
plans
nationwide.
there
seems
to
be
no
principle
rule
moreover
to
limit
the
descent’s
rationale
even
to
the
context
of
public
schools.
the
dissent’s
argument
that
if
race
was
the
problem
then
perhaps
race
is
the
solution
ignores
the
dangers
presented
by
individual
classifications,
dangers
which
are
not
as
pressing
when
the
same
ends
are
achieved
by
more
indirect
means.
to
be
forced
to
live
under
a
state
mandated
racial
label
is
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
individuals
in
our
society
and
governmental
classification
that
command
people
to
march
in
different
directions
based
on
racial
typologies,
assigned
to
individuals
can
cause
new
divisiveness.
now
that
statement
to
be
sure
invites
this
response.
now
sense
of
stigma
may
already
become
the
fate
of
those
separated
out
by
circumstances
beyond
their
immediate
control.
but
to
this
the
further
replication
must
be:
even
so
measures
other
and
differential
treatment
based
on
racial
typing
of
individuals
first
must
be
exhausted.
the
decision
today
should
not
prevents
school
districts
from
continuing
the
important
work
of
bringing
together
students
of
different
racial,
ethnic
and
economic
backgrounds.
the
compelling
interest
exists
in
avoiding
racial
isolation,
an
interest
that
a
school
district
and
its
discretion
and
expertise
may
choose
to
pursue.
likewise
a
district
may
consider
the
compelling
interest
to
achieve
a
diverse
student
population.
race
maybe
one
component
of
that
diversity
but
other
demographic
factors,
plus
special
talents
and
needs
also
be
considered.
what
the
government
is
not
permitted
to
do
absent
a
showing
of
necessity
not
made
here
is
to
classify
every
student
on
the
basis
of
race
and
to
assign
each
of
them
the
schools
based
on
their
classification.
