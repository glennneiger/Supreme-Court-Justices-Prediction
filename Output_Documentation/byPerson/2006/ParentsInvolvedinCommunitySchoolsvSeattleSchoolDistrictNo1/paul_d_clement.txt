mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondents
assert
an
interest
in
addressing
the
most
racially
isolated
schools
in
the
district,
yet
their
plan
does
not
address
the
two
most
racially
concentrated
high
schools
in
their
district.
they
likewise
have
certain
interests
in
diversity,
yet
their
plan
does
not
directly
address
diversity
other
than
pure
racial
diversity,
and
they
do
nothing
to
assemble
the
kind
of
critical
mass
that
was
at
issue
in
the
grutter
case.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
program
and
how
it
operates
in
practice,
the
triggering
critical
mass
for
the
use
of
the
racial
tie
breaker
is
when
a
student...
when
a
school
has
less
than
25
percent
white
students
or
when
it
has
less
than
45
percent
nonwhite
students.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
or
in
social
science
that
suggests
that
there's
a
radical
difference
in
the
critical
mass
based
on
the
race
of
the
students.
of
course
what
explains
that
difference
in
the
triggering
critical
mass
of
white
students
versus
nonwhite
students,
the
answer
to
that
does
not
lie
in
educational
theory,
the
answer
lies
in
the
demographics
of
the
district.
the
district
happens
to
have
20
percent
more
nonwhite
students
than
white
students,
so
they
trigger
the
race
tie
breaker
at
a
different
point
under
those
circumstances.
with
all
respect
to
respondents,
the
answer
to
how
this
program
works
lies
not
in
diversity
but
in
demographics.
they
are
clearly
working
backwards
from
the
overall
demographics
of
the
school
district
rather
than
working
forward
to
any
clearly
articulated
pedagogical
goal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
those
decisions
are
different
primarily
because
the
resulting
decision
is
not
a
racial
classification.
and
if
you
think
about
it,
when
you
had
an
overt
racial
classification,
like
you
clearly
do
in
these
cases,
then
you
naturally
ask
the
strict
scrutiny
questions
and
look
for
a
compelling
interest.
if
instead
you
start
with
a
race
neutral
government
action
that
doesn't
classify
people
directly
based
on
race,
then
i
suppose
you
could
try
to
do
some
kind
of
arlington
heights
washington
davis
type
analysis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
and
justice
kennedy,
i
will
answer
the
hypo,
but
let
me
just
say
it's
easy
for
purposes
of
the
hypo
to
say
the
sole
reason
was
for
race.
in
the
real
world,
in
fact
i
can't
imagine
that
a
site
decision
won't
be
based
at
least
in
part
on
concerns
about
the
overall
educational
benefits.
and
i
think
that's
important.
the
reason
i
start
with
that
preface
is
because
when
you
have
mixed
motives
and
a
variety
of
factors
i
think
you'd
be
unlikely
to
strike
down
that
kind
of
motive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
stevens.
i'm
saying
that
you
basically
start
at
a
different
departure
point
when
you
have
an
express
racial
classification.
i
think
i'm
trying
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
about
what
if
you
have
a
sort
of
a
race
conscious
goal
at
some
level
and
that's
why
you
select
a
particular
site
or
you
decide
that
you're
going
to
invest
in
magnet
schools
and
want
to
put
a
magnet
school
in
a
particular
school
district.
my
humble
point
is
simply
that
in
the
real
world
i
think
you're
unlikely
to
have
the
pure
racial
motive
type
objective.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
if
what
they
wanted
to
do
is
have
an
mix
of
teachers
that
might
be
okay.
if
they're
going
to
start
assigning
teachers
to
particular
schools
and
have
sort
of
racial
quotas
for
the
faculty
at
various
schools,
i
think
that
crosses
a
line.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
how
the
same
intent
with
two
programs,
there's
a
fundamental
difference
if
one
of
them
necessarily
classifies
people
on
the
basis
of
their
skin
color
and
the
other
does
not.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
we
would
take
the
position
that
there's
not
and
that
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
whether
or
not
the
policy
manages
to
avoid
classifying
people
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
ultimately
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
classifying
people
and
having
the
real
world
effect.
i
mean,
in
this
case
don't
forget
that
there
were
89
minority
students
that
wanted
to
attend
franklin
high
school.
they
could
not
solely
because
of
their
race.
at
the
same
time,
every
white
student
who
applied
to
franklin
high
school
was
allowed
in
solely
based
on
their
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
would
say
that's
fine.
we
would
say
that
that
is
permissible,
for
the
school
to
pursue
that.
just
to
get
back,
though,
again,
we
say
that
that
avoiding
racial
isolation
is...
i
just
want
to
make
the
point,
we
say
that
racial
isolation
is
an
important
government
interest.
i
think
if
you
put
this
plan
up
against
that
objective,
it
sorely
fails,
because
there
are
two
high
schools
that
i
think
you
would
look
at
as
being
racially
isolated.
they're
cleveland
and
rainier
beach,
and
this
plan
does
nothing
to
directly
address
those
high
schools.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
first
of
all
i
think
the
kind
of
interests
we're
talking
about,
avoiding
racial
isolation
and
the
like,
do
not
lend
themselves
to
absolutely
targeted,
it
has
to
be
15
percent,
it
has
to
be
50,
it
has
to
be
25,
it
has
to
be
45.
i
would
actually
suggest
that
the
danger
is
in
the
opposite
direction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean,
in
the
second
stage--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
in
the
second
case
you'll
see
that,
you
know,
the
same
logic
that
leads
to
this
leads
itself
to
stricter
bands.
but
let
me
say,
i
would
have
thought
the
analysis
would
run
the
exact
opposite
way,
and
i
would
think
that
if
you
got
to
the
point,
which
the
ninth
circuit
did
on
page
58-a
of
its
opinion,
where
it
says,
you
know,
with
this
objective
that
we've
allowed,
the
most
narrowly
tailored
way
to
get
there
is
to
expressly
use
race.
i
would
have
thought
that
might
have
suggested
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
compelling
interest,
if
that's
the
way--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
i
could
answer
the
question,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
point
to
the
specific
language
of
swann
is
helpful,
because
the
court
there
in
dictum...
i
think
everybody
would
agree
that
was
dictum...
said
that
you
could
achieve
a
prescribed
ratio.
and
that's
exactly
where
the
logic
of
the
other
side,
of
the
ninth
circuit,
of
judge
boudin,
with
all
respect,
that's
where
it
takes
you.
and
i
think
anybody
that
relied
on
that
language
in
the
wake
of
cases
like
crosson,
in
the
wake
of
freeman
against
pitts,
that
said
achieving
a
racial
balance
for
its
own
sake
is
not
constitutional,
and
bakke
and
grutter
against
gratz,
that
all
said
that
racial
balancing
is
verboten,
i
think
those
school
districts
would
have
been
misguided
in
relying
on
that
language.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
they
are
affected
by
the
plan
in
this
in
this
way,
that
in
the
past
the
district
had
used
mandatory
measures,
busing
students
across
town,
to
try
to
integrate
those
schools.
and
the
board
decided
after
many
years
of
effort
that
it
would
no
longer
do
that,
but
it
was
also
of
the
firm
conviction
that
it
would
allow
students
who
wanted
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
of
those
schools
to
do
so.
at
the
same
time,
it
implemented
magnet
schools
at
rainier
beach,
there's
a
new
building
under
construction
at
cleveland.
and
so--
