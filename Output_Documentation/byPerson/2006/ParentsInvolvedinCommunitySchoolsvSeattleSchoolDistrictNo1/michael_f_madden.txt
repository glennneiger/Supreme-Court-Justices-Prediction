mr.
michael
f.
madden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
when
seattle
was
last
before
this
court
you
struck
down
a
state
law
that
prevented
bussing
for
integration
purposes
because
that
law
prevented
the
school
board
from
seeking
to
provide
the
educational
benefits
of
integrated
schools.
at
that
time
you
said
it
was
clear
enough
that
all
children
benefit
from
exposure
to
ethnic
and
racial
diversity
in
the
classroom
by
preparing
them
for
citizenship
in
our
pluralistic
society
and
teaching
them
to
live
in
harmony
and
mutual
respect.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
providing
funding
for
street
festivals?
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
think
that
in
the
context
that
you've
described
it
that
would
be
constitutionally
very
problematic.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
because
i
can
conceive
that
it's
not...
unlike
education,
where
the
goal
is
to
educate
the
entire
community
and
to
help
to
prepare
the
community,
the
students
to
live
in
that
community,
it's
not
a
traditional
role
of
government--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
would
submit
that
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
circumstances
you've
described
and
a
school
system
which
takes
all
comers
and
is
tasked
to
educate
them
by
preparing
them
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
would
say
not,
because
housing
decisions
are
inherently
private,
unlike
public
education.
and
there's
no
way
to
know
how
those
benefits
are
being
distributed,
if
they're
going
to
be
comparable.
i
would
say
no,
it
is
not
comparable
to
the
schools.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
it
does,
and
when
there
are
more
choices
than
there
are
seats
available.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
i
think
in
each
circumstance
it
depends
on
the
status
of
the
school
system.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
think
that
is
roughly
the
circumstance
that
existed
in
the
first
seattle
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
additionally,
i
think
that
you
then
have
to
move
into
the
realm
of
what's
constitutionally
permissible
and
can
in
a
constitutionally
permissible
use
of
race
a
school
system
accommodate
other
values
like
choice
and
neighborhood
ties
and
family
connections
to
the
school
system.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i...
i
would
want
to
know
more
about
the
system
because
i
think
strictly
if
there's
nothing
else
and
there's
no
flexibility,
i
think
it
presents
narrow
tailoring
problems.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
we
have
accommodated
choice
to
the
extent
there
are
seats
available.
and
then
we
go
to
family
connections.
and
then
we...
in
operation,
admit
everyone
who
lives
close
to
the
school.
and
then
as
to
those
that
live
further
away,
we
look
to
see
what's
the
school's
racial
demographic.
is
it
significantly
different
than
the
community's?
these
schools
we
have
talked
about
have
been
the
objects
of
significantly
more
aggressive
integration
efforts,
and
the
board
wanted
to
preserve
those.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
the
board
actually
at
every
turn
reflected
in
the
record
discussed
whether
it
was
necessary
to
continue
the
use
of
race,
whether
to
narrow
it,
and
eventually
to
end
it.
and
i
think
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
408,
the
superintendent's
testimony
of
the,
simultaneously
the
measures
that
the
board
was
implementing
in
terms
of
resource
allocation,
implementation
of
new
programs,
because
they
realized
that
by
diversifying
choice,
they
could
hopefully
achieve
some
of
these
same
ends,
not
as
quickly,
not
as
efficiently,
but
that
they
could
achieve
them.
that's
been
indeed
the
entire
trajectory
of
seattle's
integration
efforts
since
the
first
seattle
plan.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
think
that
the
term
racial
balancing
has
two
significant
meanings.
one
is
a
plan
that
does
not
foster
a
compelling
interest.
and
second,
a
plan
that
is
too
rigid,
a
quota,
for
instance,
that
might
not
pass
narrow
tailoring
given
the
context.
in
this
case
we're
not
after
a
rigid
set
of
numbers,
and
certainly
not
after
a
rigid
set
of
numbers
for
their
own
sake.
the
purpose
was
to
have
schools
that
had
become
diverse
through
integration
efforts
not
stray
too
far
from
the
community's
demographic
because
we're
trying
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
those
communities.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
the
board
here
was
trying
to
distribute,
sort
out
seats
that
were
available
at
these
popular
schools;
and
so
it
devised
a
system
whereby
every
student
had
the
opportunity
to
be
assigned
to
at
least
one
of
those
popular
schools;
and
as
far
as
the
record
shows
in
plaintiffs'
briefing,
there's
no
material
differences
between
those...
those
popular
schools.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
no.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
don't
think
the
board
has
ever
found
that
necessary
to,
to
achieve
diversity
in
the
faculty.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
what
happened
is
that,
that
it--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--the
history
is
that
the
board
had
both
narrowed
the
use
of
the
integration
tie
breaker
in
'99
and
2000
and
then
continued
it
for
the
2001
school
year.
we
were...
in
2000-2001
school
year,
we
were
enjoined
in
2001
to
use
it
in
that
year,
which
was
considerably
disruptive.
but
the
board
was
also,
the
measures
that
it
had
implemented,
implementing
magnet
schools
at
rainier
beach
and
chief
south
high
schools
in
the
south
end,
implementing
it
in--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
when,
when
this
plan
has...
this...
the
description
is
yes,
basically
right.
when
this
plan
was
suspended
in,
after
the
court
of
appeals
enjoined
it,
the
board
had,
as
i
said,
experienced
some
considerable
disruption
in
the
assignments
because
of
the
timing
of
the
injunction.
but
the
board
was
also
looking
at
the
effect
of
the
race
neutral,
if
you
will,
program
measures
that
it
had
implemented.
such
that
now,
ingram
high
school
in
the
north
end
of
seattle
is
much
more
popular.
nathan
hale
is
no
longer
over
subscribed.
there's
less
demand
for
ballard,
but
there
have
been--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--we
have
some
change
of
conditions,
but
the
basic
conditions
remain,
the
trend
has
not
been
positive.
for
example,
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
picked--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--not,
not
in
the
sense--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--we
are
not
complaining
about
segregation
resulting
from
purposeful
discrimination.
that's--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--i--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--talking
about
schools
that
are
on
the
one
end
racially
isolated.
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
two
of
those.
and
talking
on
the
other
end
about
preserving
the
diversity
that
we
had
achieved
through
these
years
of
effort
in
these
north
end
schools.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
yes.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
it,
it
may
mean
the
board
confronted
with
the
circumstances
might
well
make
that
decision
independent
of
this
litigation.
but
let
me
answer
the
specific.
let's
take
franklin
high
school
to
begin
with.
in,
in
2000,
that
school
was...
had
25
percent
white
enrollment.
in
2005,
it
had
10
percent
white
enrollment.
in
the
ninth
grade,
which
is
really
the,
the
level
at
which
we
see
the
effect
of
the
integration
tie
breaker,
in
2000,
the
white
enrollment
was
21
percent;
it
was
8
percent
in
2005.
go
to
ballard
high
school
on
the
other
end.
ballard
was
56
percent
white
students
in
2000;
it's
62
percent
in
2005.
the
ninth
grade
class
has
moved
from
46
percent
white
students
to
58
percent
white
students.
keeping
in
mind
that
that
school
is
now
significantly
less
popular
than
it
was,
i
think
those
effects
would
probably
be,
be
more
extreme.
but
the
plan...
i
want
to
emphasize,
the
plan
was
to
try
to
disperse
demand
and
to
foster
choices
that
would
result
in
diversity,
not
to
compel
it.
we
do
not--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--we,
we
are
concerned
about
improving
the
quality
of
education
in
all
the
schools.
we
do
not
mandate
that
a
student
attend
a
school
for
integration
purposes
as
we
once
did.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
because
it,
it's
important
to
the
credibility
and
functionality
of
the
school
system
to
have
a
system
that
is
accepted
by
the
public,
by
our
constituents.
and
so
people
like
choice;
they
also
like
neighborhood
schools;
they
also
like
diverse
schools.
and
the
board
recognized
when
it
set
about
to
develop
this
plan
that
accommodating
all
of
those
values
would
require
some
trade
offs.
and
the
board,
familiar
with
the
local
conditions,
familiar
with
the
history,
did
just
that
in
what
i
submit
was
a
narrowly
tailored
and
appropriate
way.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
cleveland
is
now
about
8
percent.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
don't
remember
the
precise
number
in
2000,
but
that
sounds
about
right.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
the...
the
problem
that
the
board
was
addressing
was
principally
a,
a
problem
of
the
distribution
of
white
and
nonwhite
students.
the...
as
a
generality,
75
percent
of
all
nonwhite
students
in
the
district
lived
in
south
seattle.
and
that
was
true
for
all
the
ethnic
groups
except
native
americans,
who
are
a
very
small--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--i
would
say
if
that
circumstance
occurred,
that
that
would
be
something
that
the
board
would
have
to
pay
attention
to
and
consider.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--no,
because
the
numbers
in
terms
of
the
distribution
of
ethnic
groups,
separate
ethnic
groups
and
the
benefits
or
impacts
of
the
plan
were
spread
proportionately--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--i
may,
i
may
have
confused
the
answer
to
the
hypothetical
with
the,
with
rationale
on
the
ground,
which
was
that
we
did
not
have
that
kind
of
single
minority
ethnic
group
disparity
existing
in
any
school.
i
was
saying,
however,
that
if
that
existed,
i
think
that
would
be
something
the
board
would
have
to
be
mindful
of.
as
a
practical
matter,
because
our
nonwhite
ethnic
neighborhoods
in
south
seattle
are
themselves
quite
integrated,
that
the
movement
under
this
plan
did
not
produce
disparities
for
or
against
any
particular
ethnic
group.
and
so
i
think
in
the
end
it
might
have
been
more
divisive
to
have
individual
tiebreakers
for
the
separate
minority
ethnic
groups.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
would
say...
well,
the
answer
is--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--the
district
has
no
criteria
itself.
the
district
uses
classifications
that
are
developed
by
the
federal
government
but
allows
parents
to
self
identify
children.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
that
allows
the
parents
to
self
identify,
and
the
record
in
this
case
through
the
testimony
of
petitioner's
president
is
they
were
aware
of
no
abuse
of
that.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
it
seems
like
one
but
according
to
the
record,
it's
not
an
issue.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--oh,
yes.
yes.
they
offer...
the
popular
schools
to
which
everyone
had
access
under
this
plan
who
wanted
access,
i
think
it's...
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
because
the
schools
are
not
racially
separate.
the
goal
is
to
maintain
the
diversity
that
existed
within
a
broad
range
in
order
to
try
to
obtain
the
benefits
that
the
educational
research
show
flow
from
an
integrated
education.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
they're
not
being
denied
admission.
they're
being...
seats
are
being
distributed
to
them.
this
is
not
like--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--yes.
but
this
is
not
like
being
denied
admission
to
a
state's
flagship
university.
i
think
for
that
proposition,
i
would
cite
justice
powell's
opinion
in
the
bakke
case
where
he
was
at
some
pains
to
point
out
that
a
school
integration
plan
is
wholly
dissimilar
to
a
selective
university
admissions
plan.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
it
depends
on
what
school
you're
talking
about,
justice
alito.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
most
important
point
to
start
with
is
that
there
was
no
contention
that
there
was
any
material
difference
in
quality
between
the
five
popular
high
schools.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
you
would
find
a
reasonable
basis
to
perceive
a
quality
difference
between
those
two
schools,
but
this
plan
didn't
assign
any
students
to
cleveland.
i
want
to
take
a
moment,
if
i
can,
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
individualized
consideration,
because
so
much
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
it
in
the
earlier
discussion.
it
seems
to
us,
first
of
all,
that
this
court
in
grutter
said
that
not
all
uses
of
race
trigger
the
same
objections
and
that
the
court
must
be
mindful
of
the
context.
this
is
not,
as
i've
said,
a
selective
or
merit
based
system
where
we
adjudge
one
student
to
be
better
than
the
other.
we
do
consider
individual
factors
before
we
get
to
race,
starting
with
choice
and
family
connection,
and
how
close
you
live
to
the
school.
but
ultimately,
this
is
a
distributive
system
which,
as
justice
powell...
as
i
noted,
justice
powell
said
in
the
bakke
case,
is
quite
wholly
dissimilar
to
a
selective
or
merit
based
system.
what
it
seems
to
us
is
being
suggested
by
the
united
states
and
by
the
petitioner
is
a
system
that
would
force
an
individualized
merit
based
review
on
any
kind
of
race
conscious
program,
specifically
an
assignment
to
public
schools.
that
rule
allows
the
means
to
define
the
ends;
and
it
ends
up,
i
think,
defeating
the
purpose
that
the
court
had
of
not
stigmatizing--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--mr.
chief
justice,
in
grutter
you
said
specifically
that
individualized
review
was
required
in
the
context
of
university
admissions.
in
this
context,
the
kind
of
review,
the
specific
kind
of
review
that
i
understand
the
united
states
to
urge
and
the
petitioner
to
urge,
serves
no
purpose,
and
it
may
itself
be
stigmatizing
in
the
context
of
public
schools
where
everyone
gets
a
seat.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
i
am
saying,
however,
that
this
plan,
consistent
with
narrow
tailoring,
provided
consideration
of
individual
circumstances,
including
an
appeal
on
hardship
grounds
for
someone
who
felt
that
they
had
been
denied
a
school
that
they
needed
to
be
in.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
well,
like
the
michigan
cases,
sometimes
students
in
the
end
of
the
day
have
an
assignment
determined
by
race.
just
like
in
the
university
cases,
at
some
point
race
will
be
a
tipping
factor.
it's
different,
though,
when
we
put
someone
in
a
basically
comparable
school.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
because
segregation
is
harmful.
integration,
this
court
has
recognized
in
swann,
in
the
first
seattle
case,
has
benefits.
the
district
was--
mr.
michael
f.
madden
--there
are
many
areas
of
the
law,
certainly
in
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment,
that
have
considerable
flexibility.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
i
think
that
in
grutter
and
gratz,
this
court
rejected
the
absolute
and
instead
described
strict
scrutiny,
which
we
feel
we
need,
and
which
is
why
we
are
not
urging
an
absolute
position.
we
say
that
we
indeed
comply
with
the
requirements
of
narrow
tailoring,
and
that
the
plan
therefore
should
be
upheld.
mr.
michael
f.
madden
we
certainly
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
we'd
go
one
step
further
and
note
that
in
brown,
this
court
said
that
the
effects
of
segregated
schools
are
worse.
