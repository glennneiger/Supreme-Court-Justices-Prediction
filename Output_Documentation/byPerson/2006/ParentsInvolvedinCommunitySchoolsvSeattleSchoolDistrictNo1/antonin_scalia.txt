you
would
object,
then,
to
magnet
schools?
you
would
object
to
any
system
that
is
designed
to
try
to
cause
people
voluntarily
to
go
into
a
system
that
is
more
racially
mixed?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
but
i'm
trying
to
find
what,
you
know,
the
outer
limits
of
your
contentions
are.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
your
briefs
indicated
that
you
would
object
to
something
like
magnet
schools.
the...
even
if
one
of
the
purposes
of
those
schools
is
to
try
to
cause
more
white
students
to
go
to
schools
that
are
predominantly
nonwhite.
it's
just
voluntary,
i
mean,
but
the
object
is
to
achieve
a
greater
racial
mix.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
agree
that
this
is
not
an
affirmative
action
case?
is
it
not?
wherein
does
it
differ?
i
thought
that
the
school
district
was
selecting
some
people
because
they
wanted
a
certain
racial
mix
in
the
schools,
and
were
taking
the
affirmative
action
of
giving
a
preference
to
students
of
a
certain
race.
why
isn't...
why
doesn't
that
qualify
as
affirmative
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
else
it
is.
what
do
you
think
it
is
that
causes
you
to
seemingly
accept
the
characterization
that
this
is
not
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there
was
a
criterion
here,
and
that
is,
you
can
go
to
whatever
school
you
want.
you
are
allowed
to
go
to
a
certain
choice
of
school.
the
criterion
was
your
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
they're
not.
that's
why
some
of
them
were
oversubscribed.
that's
why
others
were
undersubscribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
clement,
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
desiring
a
mingling
of
the
races
and
establishing
policies
which
achieve
that
result
but
which
do
not
single
out
individuals
and
disqualify
them
for
certain
things
because
of
their
race?
is
there
anything
wrong
with
a
policy
of
wanting
to
have
racial
mix?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
madden,
that's
certainly
an
admirable
goal.
could
a
local
unit,
a
municipality,
or
even
a
state
have
another
goal?
let's
say
what
used
to
be
great
about
the
united
states
was
the
presence
of
various
ethnic
groups.
i
mean,
there
were
the
pennsylvania
dutch,
there
were
the
amish,
there
were
little
italys,
there
were
chinatowns,
and
these
things
are
beginning
to
disappear.
and
we
think
that
we
should
encourage
the
continuation
of
that
diversity,
as
the
federal
government
has
done
with
respect
to
american
indian
tribes.
and
therefore,
we're
going
to
use
public
funds
for
such
things
as
street
festivals,
a
chinatown
street
festival,
an
italian
street
festival.
we're
going
to
encourage
those
organizations
that
maintain
that
separateness.
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
that
objective?
justice
antonin
scalia
about
the
objective?
i
mean,
think
we
should
foster
separateness?
is
there
anything
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--fine...
it
would
be
problematic?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
please
let
me
finish
the
line
of
questioning.
assume
with
me
that
it
is
not
an
unconstitutional
objective,
which
i
am
sure
it's
not.
could
the...
could
the
government
achieve
that
objective
by
barring
people
from
moving
into
little
italy
or
giving
a
preference
to
some
people
to
buy
real
estate
in
little
italy
if
they
are
of
italian
ancestry?
could
it
do
that?
absolutely
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
appear
that
even
if
the
objective
is
okay,
you
cannot
achieve
it
by
any
means
whatever.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
objective
of
achieving
a
diverse
balanced
society
is
perfectly
all
right,
although
certainly
not
the
only
objective
in
the
world.
the
mere
fact
that
it's
okay
doesn't
mean
you
can
achieve
it
by
any
means
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
quotas
for,
for
racial
hiring
of
your
faculty
in
these
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
segregated,
segregated...
you
refer
to
some
of
the
schools
as
segregated.
and
i,
that's
not
what
i
understand
by
segregated.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
if
you
belong
to
a
country
club
that,
that...
that
has
15
percent
black
members,
i
would
not
consider
that
a
segregated
country
club.
so
what
you
are
complaining
about
is,
is
not
segregation
in
any,
in
any
reasonable
sense
of
the
word.
you're
complaining
about
a
lack
of
racial
balance.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
meaning
of
segregation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
racial
balance.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you're
also--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
criteria
of
race
does
the
school,
just
out
of
curiosity,
does
the
school
district
use?
i
mean,
what
if
a
particular
child's
grandfather
was
white?
would
he
qualify
as
a
white
or
nonwhite.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
must
be
some
criterion.
there
are
many
people
of
mixed
blood.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
allows
parents
to
say--
i'm
white,
no
matter
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
seems
like
a
big
loophole.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
you
can't
make
an
omelet
without
breaking
eggs.
can
you
think
of
any
area
of
the
law
in
which
we
say
whatever
it
takes,
so
long
as
there's
a
real
need,
whatever
it
takes...
i
mean,
if
we
have
a
lot
of
crime
out
there
and
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
it
is
to
use
warrantless
searches,
you
know,
fudge
on
some
of
the
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights,
whatever
it
takes,
we've
got
to
do
it?
is
there
any
area
of
the
law
that
doesn't
have
some
absolute
restrictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about
the
fourteenth?
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
absolute
restrictions,
that
you
cannot
judge
and
classify
people
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
you
can
pursue
the
objectives
that
your
school
board
is
pursuing,
but
at
some
point
you
come
up
against
an
absolute,
and
aren't
you
just
denying
that?
