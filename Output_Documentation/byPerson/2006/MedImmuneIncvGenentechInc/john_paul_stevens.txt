mr.
kester,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
it
your
view
that
gen-probe
represented
a
change
in
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
there...
before
gen-probe
was
decided,
were
there
any
cases,
like
this
case,
that
were
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
the...
where
the
licensee
brought
suit
challenging
validity
while
the
license
was
still
in
full--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
can
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
at
the
time
they
negotiate
the
license
agreement
there's
some
uncertainty
about
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
not.
so,
at
the
end
of
the
license
agreement...
they
agree
on
the
royalties,
the
term,
and
the...
everything
it
covers,
but
they
put
in
a
provision
and
say,
"we're
not
entirely
sure
the
patent
is
valid,
so
we
reserve
the
right
to
bring
an
action
challenging
the
validity
of
the
patent.
"
"we
will
pay
royalties
in
the
meantime,
and
the...
you
will
accept
these
royalties
as
sufficient
for
the
use
of
the
patent,
that,
if
we
win,
you
don't
have
to
pay
royals,
if
we
lose,
you
do.
"
would
that
be
a
valid
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
be
precisely
the
same
issue
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
as
to
whether
there's
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
not
being
coerced,
but
he's
bargaining
a
little
better
royalty
rate
than
he'll...
otherwise
would
have
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
really
asking--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
the
parties
could
agree
to
create
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
your
light
goes
off?
i
know
it's
not...
goes
to
the
"case
or
controversy"
issue,
but,
in
your
view,
was
the
bringing
of
this
action
a
material
breach
of
an
implied
condition
of
the
contract
that
would
justify
a
termination
of
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
think
there
was.
