justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we,
at
some
point,
either
in
this
case
or
some
later
case,
may
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
such
a
provision
is
enforceable.
if
it
is,
we
may
be...
not
be
talking
about
much.
it's
just
going
to
be
boilerplate
in
every
license
agreement,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it...
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
there
are
reasons
not
to
enforce
this,
so
that
we
don't
have
courts
flooded
with
lawsuits,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
didn't
have
all
the
information.
suppose
you
enter
into
a
license
agreement...
you're
convinced,
as
the
one
that's
going
to
pay
the
license
fee,
that
it's
a
good
patent...
after
the
agreement's
signed,
the
technological
advances,
other
disclosures,
indicate
that
the
patent
is
deficient.
could
you
sue
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then...
so
then,
the
argument
that
you've
made
is
just
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--relevant
for
us,
the
fact
that
they
knew
everything--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it
also
means
that
this
isn't
really
a
settlement,
in
any
respect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
poe
versus
ullman
was
a
case
in
which,
even
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
law,
there
was
going
to
be
no
prosecution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he...
but,
in
this...
in
this
case,
if
there's
a
failure
to...
of...
conform
to
the
terms
of
the
license
agreement,
there's
going
to
be
a
lawsuit.
so,
i
think
poe
versus
ullman
is
just
not
relevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but,
in
poe
versus
ullman,
the
ultimate
action
was
basically
like
violating
the
contract
here,
and
that's
why
it's
not
an
applicable
precedent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
so,
and
it's
a
super-violation
of
an
implied
covenant,
and
i
guess
you
could
get
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
that
your
theory
is
that
it's
a
super-violation
of
an
implied
covenant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
"not
only
did
we
agree
to
it,
but
we
you
can't
even
do
it
if
you
agree
to
it.
