mr.
john
g.
kester
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
of
this
morning,
it
is
exactly
70
years
ago
to
the
day,
minus
4
months,
that
this
court
heard
argument
challenging
the
new
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
of
1934,
in
an
action
to
construe
an
insurance
contract.
and
exactly
25
years...
25
days
later,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
hughes,
joined
by
justices
stone,
brandeis,
and
others,
the
act
was
held
fully
consistent
with
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
this
morning,
you
are
here
because
an
action
was
brought
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
a
biomedical
manufacturer
need
not
play...
pay
large
sums,
under
a
license
as
patent
royalties,
under
a
patent
it
contends
is
invalid,
unenforceable,
and
not
infringed,
but
is
paying
royalties
under
protest
in
the
meantime.
that
complaint
was
ordered
dismissed
by
the
federal
circuit
as
outside
the
article
iii
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
in
detail,
the
petitioner,
medimmune,
is
a
biotech
company,
formed
in
1988.
during
the
1990s--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--yes?
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
doubt
it
would
be
enforceable.
it
would
be
a
matter...
under
the
lear
case,
lear
against
adkins,
it
would
be
an...
it
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
if
such...
if
such
a
claim
were
raised.
this
case
is
here
at
the
level
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
kester
under
12--
under
12(b)(6)--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--perhaps.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it's
not
jurisdictional,
exactly,
justice
souter.
this
is
a
jurisdictional
ruling.
and
that's
all
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
on.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
so--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and
those
reasons,
i
would
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
were
taken
care
of
in
lear,
for
the
most
part,
in
1969.
provisions
in
license
contracts
that
prevent
challenges
to
the
contracts
are
not
enforceable
under
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
then,
i...
as
i
was
saying,
that
is
a
matter
of
patent
law.
that's
not
a
matter
of
jurisdictional
law.
we're
here--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it
has...
it
has
happened,
on
various
occasions,
that
patentees
have
brought
suit
to
establish
the
validity
of--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--against
licensees
and
others.
and
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
controversy
could
arise
in
any
number
of
ways.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
patentee
could
be
paying
his
royalties.
the
patentee
could
also
be
putting
ads
in
the
paper
saying,
"this
is
not
a
valid
patent.
"
it
could...
it
could
have
acquired
a
lot
of
publicity.
and,
in
the
end,
there
could
be
reasons,
and
there
have
been
such
cases...
which
we
cited,
47
of,
our
brief...
where
such
suits
have
been
brought.
but--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--if
the
licensee
said,
"i
am
not
contesting
that
patent.
"
that
could
be.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that...
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
practicality
is
that
a
patentee
starts
out
with,
essentially,
a
judgment
that
the
patent
is
valid.
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity.
and
to
challenge
that
patent...
that
presumption
of
validity,
is
a
very
difficult
undertaking.
most
of
them
don't
bother.
why
would
they?
if
they
are
receiving...
if
they're
receiving--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--a
settlement
does
not
deprive
a
federal
court
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
that's
the
narrow
point
that
is
before
this...
before
this
court.
mr.
john
g.
kester
but
not
the
same
underlying
question,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect,
because
then
you
are
in
a
situation
like
the
business
forms
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
came
out
shortly
after
the
lear.
there
was
a
settle...
settlement,
and
the...
and
it
was
argued
that
the
settlement
was
not
effective
because
of
the
lear
decision,
and
parties
can't
settle
themselves
out
of
the
lear
decision.
but
that
is
all
under
12(b)(6),
and
not
12(b)(1).
this
case
involves
a
12(b)(1)
motion,
not
a
12(b)(6)--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--motion.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
would
be
effectively
overruling
lear,
which
is
what,
i
think,
is
what
many
of
the
parties
in
this
case
actually
seek
to
do.
lear
does
not
allow
inhibitions
of
challenges
to
patent
licenses.
a
licensee
can
challenge
the
validity,
the
enforceability
of
the
patent.
that's
because
there's
a
public
interest
in
this,
as
well.
parties
cannot
simply
contract
with
each
other
and
prevent
a
challenge
to
a...
to
a
patent--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--license.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that...
those
were
the
facts
of
lear.
but...
it
happened
that
way
in
lear,
but
that
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
lear.
lear
would
not
totally
cover
that
situation,
but
we
would
submit
to
this
court,
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference.
the
reasoning
of
lear
is
the
same.
the
licensee
cannot,
by
contract,
be
estopped,
licensee
estoppel,
from
challenging
a
patent.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
suspect
there
are
many
ways,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
not
by
throwing
them
out
on
a
jurisdictional
basis
at
the
very
first
moment
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
john
g.
kester
there
may
be
ways
this
could
be
arranged
at
the
second
level,
through--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
is
a
question
that
would
arise
under
lear
against
adkins.
and
the
question
before
this
court
in
that
situation,
if
it
got
to
this
court,
would
be,
is
that
kind
of
a
provision
compatible
with
the
policy
that
was
so
firmly
expressed
by
justice
harlan
in
lear,
and
has
been
reiterated
in
so
many
subsequent
cases
of
this
court?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
don't
think
that
i
have
rejected
both
the
government's
suggestions.
i've
said
that
they
raise
problems
on...
as
to
the
scope
of
lear.
mr.
john
g.
kester
not
quite,
justice
souter.
i
would
say
the
nub
of
your
position
is
the
altvater
case,
the
aetna
case,
the
maryland--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that...
but
that...
but
was--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--well,
i
would
say
what
it...
what
it
raises
is
simply
an
extra
fact,
but
it
wasn't
a
necessary
fact.
because
this
court,
in
altvater,
specifically
pointed
out
that
even
if
there
weren't
an
injunction
there,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
the
danger
forced
on
the
licensee,
of
an
infringement
suit;
and
an
infringement
suit
means,
possibly,
an
injunction
of
the
patent,
treble
damages,
any
number
of
sanctions.
an
injunction
suit
can
put
a
company
out
of
business,
especially
like
a
company
like
my
client
here.
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
it--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it's
more...
it's
more
than
public
policy,
it's
article
iii.
article
iii
says
that
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
in
this
situation.
and
that
was
settled--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--in
aetna.
mr.
john
g.
kester
what
we
are
presenting
in
this
case
is
a
dispute
about
money.
it's
not
abstract.
it's
not
hypothetical.
it's
not
conjectural.
it
is
concrete,
immediate.
all
the
facts
are
in.
it's
definitely
adversarial.
it's
legal.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it
is
the...
it
is
that,
"i
am
having
to
pay
the
royalties...
that
i
say
i
did
not
agree
to
pay,
because
this
is
an
invalid
patent.
"
money
is
being
paid
by
my
client
every
quarter,
large
amounts
of
money.
that
is
a
major
injury.
mr.
john
g.
kester
and
if--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--and
if--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--it
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
we're
saying
that
that
isn't
what
we
agreed
to.
we're
saying
this
is
a
contract
dispute.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--because
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
threat--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--of
this--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but,
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
can
also
amend
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
if
it
wants.
and
congress
was
proud
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
when
it
was
passed
in
1934.
and
the
legislative
history
of
it...
and
nothing
in
the
text
is
contrary,
says
the
purpose
of
this
is
so
that
contracts
can
be
resolved
without
breach,
and
judicial
determinations
can
be
had.
it's
like
a
noninvasive,
a
less
invasive
kind
of
surgery.
mr.
john
g.
kester
absolutely.
mr.
john
g.
kester
there
were
many,
your
honor,
and
they
were
decided--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--we--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--we
had
suits
in
the
third
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
and
even
in
the
federal
circuit,
in
its
early
days,
where
it
quoted
those
cases
which
said,
"it
is
not
necessary
for
the
licensee
to
stop
paying
payments
in
order
for
article
iii
to
be
satisfied.
"
this
case
came
as
a
shock
in
2004.
and,
in
fact,
the
judges
below,
in
this
series
of
cases,
all
said,
"we
thought
it
was
settled
law
the
other
way.
"
all
this
case
represents,
from
our
point
of
view,
is,
"let's
go
back
to
the
way
it
has
always
been.
"
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
several
quick
items.
i
think...
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
were,
a
while
ago,
putting
the
horse
in
front
of
the
cart,
which
was
right
where
it
belongs.
the
contract
claim
is
clear
in
the
record.
it's
at
page
136
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
don't
think
more
needs
to
be
said
about
it.
harvey
steel,
on
which
respondents
rely,
was,
of
course,
overruled--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
we
don't.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
it...
it's
raised
in
the...
in
the
first
remanded
complaint.
it's
been
a...
it's
been
here
throughout.
if
it...
if
it
even
matters.
i
mean,
we
wouldn't
concede
that
that...
that
that
would
even
matter.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes.
the
whole
record
was...
you
mean
was
it
argued--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
believe
it
was.
i'd
have
to
go
back
and...
you
mean
in
terms
of
the
oral
argument.
it
was
certainly
in
the
briefs.
it
was
certainly
not
waived.
there
was
never,
of
course,
any...
anything
in
the
license,
or
anyplace
else,
where
petitioner
gave
up
the
right
to
sue.
petitioner
doesn't
need
permission
in
the
license
to
sue.
and
as
for
the
shock
in
the
lower
courts
when
this
case
was
decided,
i
would
call
to
your
attention
what
the
federal
circuit,
in
1983,
itself,
said,
and
it
quoted
the
warner-jenkinson
case,
which
was
the
second
circuit
case
that
my
friend
dismissed
somewhat.
the
c.r.
bard
case...
this
is
federal
circuit,
early...
starts
out,
the
opening
line...
it
says,
and
i
quote...
this
is
716
f.
2d
875...
"we
hold
that
a
patent
license
need
not
be
terminated
before
a
patent
licensee
may
bring
a
federal
declaratory
judgment
action.
"
close
quote.
and
the
last
words
of
the
same
opinion,
at
882
of
716
f.
2d,
are,
"we
hold
that
a
patent
licensee
may
bring
a
federal
declaratory
judgment
action
to
declare
the
federal...
to
declare
the
patent
subject
to
the
license
invalid
without
prior
termination
of
the...
of
the
license.
"
that
was
1983.
gen-probe
was
2004.
something
happened
in
the
interval.
finally,
the
discussion
of
settlements
here
strikes
me
as,
indeed,
strange,
because
if
this...
if
a
license
were
to
be
redesignated
as
a
settlement,
we
would
have
the
situation
here
where...
a
license
was
signed
in
1977;
the
only
patent
at
issue
in
this
case
was
not
even
issued
until
2001.
mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you,
mr.--
