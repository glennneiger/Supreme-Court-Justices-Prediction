justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
point
is,
it's
not
jurisdictional.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to...
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
jurisdictional
defense
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
an
affirmative
defense,
assuming
jurisdiction,
is
there
any...
is
there
any
reason
for
us
to
accept
your
position,
other
than
the
reason
that
you
have
mentioned
a
number
of
times,
and
that
is
the
adoption
and
encouragement
of
a
public
policy
that
allows
patent
challenges
freely?
is
that
the
nub
of
our
reasoning,
if
we
were
to
support
your
position,
either
jurisdictionally,
in
this
case,
or
in
recognizing...
or
the...
in
dealing
with
the
affirmative
defense
in
another
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
altvater
is
difficult
for
you,
isn't
it?
because
there
was
an
injunction
in
altvater,
wasn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
raises
an
entirely
different
policy
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is...
that
is
a
good
reason.
and,
i
take
it,
it's
your
logic
that
that
is
a
good
reason
to
recognize
a
fairly
broad
right
on
the
part
of
the
licensee
to
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
nub
of
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
public
policy
that
favors
relative--
justice
david
h.
souter
--freedom
to
challenge--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
realize
that.
but,
i
mean,
what
we've
got
in
this
case,
and
in
any
of
these
cases,
is
a
question
of
line-drawing
under
article
iii.
and
your
argument
is,
you
want
to
draw
the
line
where
you
want
it
drawn
primarily
because
there
are
practical
reasons
to
favor
a
public
policy
of
free
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
we
accept
the
characterization
that
it's
a
compromise?
as
i...
and
maybe
i'm
just
factually
wrong
here?
i
thought,
at
the
time
they
entered
into
the
license
agreement,
they
had
some
disagreements
about
the
scope
of
the
then-patent,
the
scope
of
the
anticipated
patent,
and
so
on,
and
they
couldn't
very
well
be
resolved.
but
they
were...
they
were
not
settling,
in
the...
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
word,
a...
let
us
say,
a
focus
claim,
one
against
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
had
they
gotten
to
the
point,
prior
to
the
execution
of
the
contract,
in
which
one
party
was
saying,
"you
may
not
do
this",
and
the
other
party
was
saying,
"oh,
yes
i
can",
so
that
there...
there
was
a
focus
controversy
that
would
have
been
the
subject
matter
of
a
conventional
lawsuit,
then
and
there,
had
there
not
been
this
license
agreement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question
is,
how
far
ahead
of
the
pass
can
they
get
and
still
call
it
a
settlement?
"in
the
sense
that
you're
using
that
term.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
but
you
were
saying
that
the
status
of
that
agreement,
for
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
question
here,
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
status
of
an
agreement
that
they
might
have
entered
into
after
one
party
had
brought
suit
against
the
other.
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
they...
they
had
settled.
and
then,
later
on,
somebody
wanted
to
repudiate
the
settlement.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
event--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
equivalent
to
a
settlement
after
a
formal
demand
has
been
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
further...
on
further
wrinkle.
what
if
the
contract
goes
the
further
step
and
says,
"even
if
the
patent
were
determined,
in
any
action,
to
be
invalid,
there
will
still
be
a
royalty
payable,
because
that's
what...
that's...
that
is
consideration
for
the
fact
that
we
are
not
going
to
start
any
controversy
now.
"
let's
assume
they
assume,
precisely,
the
invalidity.
would
you
say
the
contract
is
unenforceable
then,
and
the...
and
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and,
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
there
would
be
no
case
or
controversy
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--take
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
add
the
following.
there
is
a
provision
in
there
to
the
effect
that
if,
during
the
term
of
this
contract,
the
license
is
determined
to
be
invalid,
royalties
will
still
be
payable
under
this
contract--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
that
is
one
of
the
contingencies,
which
is
a
consideration
for
our
bargain.
would
you
say,
in
those
circumstances,
that
your
answer
would
be
the
same,
that
there's
no...
there's
no
case
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
i'm
talking
about
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
see--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
if...
do
you
see
a
difference
between...
i
guess
you're
saying
there's
no
difference
between
my
added
wrinkle
on
the
hypo
and
the
chief
justice's
hypo,
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
