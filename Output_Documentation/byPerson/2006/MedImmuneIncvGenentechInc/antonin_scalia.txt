justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
you
mean,
it
would
be
enforceable;
that
if
such
a
suit
were
brought,
the
licensor
could
raise
that
contractual
provision
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
the
suit.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
then
it
is
enforceable.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
well,
you
can
have
such
a
dispute
on
a
theoretical
question
between,
i
don't
know,
the
aclu
and
the
national
rifle
association,
but
that
doesn't
create
a
case
or
controversy.
what
is
the
injury,
the
imminent
injury
to
your...
to
your
client
that
is
the
basis
for
the
case
or
controversy?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
anything
other
than,
"i
have
to
pay
the
royalties
that
i
agreed
to
pay?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
unlawful
to
agree
to
pay
somebody
money
who
does
not
have
a
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
speaking
as
though
somehow
that...
such
a
contract
is
contrary
to
public
policy,
and
void.
justice
antonin
scalia
contractually?
they
say
that
that's
their
contractual
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
appear
in
the
licensing
agreement?
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
i
took
them
as
just
asserting
a
general
proposition
of
law...
that,
where
they've
agreed
to
pay
royalties
because
of
a
patent,
if
the
patent
is
invalid,
they
don't
have
to
pay
royalties...
not
because
there's
some
special
provision
in
this
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there's
really
not
much
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
that's
clearly
a
case
of
controversy,
isn't
it?
there
is
a
dispute
over
the
meaning
of
that
provision
of
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
there's
less
here
than
meets
the
eye.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
would
their...
what
would
their
concrete
injury
be?
what
is
the
threatened
imminent
injury
that
they
would
assert
in
that...
in
that
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
licensee
who's
paying
the
license
fees.
what
is
their
concrete
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long
as
they're
still
paying
the
royalties,
isn't
that
sort
of
an
abstract
disagreement?
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
like
the
aclu
saying
that
the
patent's
invalid.
you
know,
it's
a
nice
theoretical
question
that
we
can
argue
about,
but
as
long
as
they're
paying
the
royalties,
where's
the
concrete
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--very
difficult--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
see
how
there
would
be
a
proper
declaratory
judgment
action
brought
by
the
patentee
here.
it's
just
not
the
kind
of
a
situation
where
you
can
have
a
mirror-image
suit.
i
don't
see
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--patentee--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
that
work
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
i
have
a
review
of
the
bidding?
what--
[laughter]
go
back...
what
is
the
hypothetical--
justice
antonin
scalia
--continue
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
the
patent
bar
is
sort
of
specialized...
more
than
"sort
of"...
it's
a
specialized
bar,
and
i've
never...
i've
never
been
a
part
of
it.
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
petitioner's
counsel
that
gen-probe
came
as
a...
as
a
shock
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait.
before
you
leave
that,
do
you
agree
that
it
was
not
raised
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
can
you
tell
us
where
it
was
raised
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
the
petitioner,
medimmune,
inc
and
respondents,
genentech,
inc
and
city
of
hope,
entered
into
a
patent
license
agreement
covering
among
other
things
the
respondent’s
then-pending
patent
application.
after
the
patent
application
matured
into
the
cabilly
ii
patent,
respondent
genentech
delivered
petitioner
a
letter
expressing
its
belief
that
petitioner’s
product,
synagis,
was
covered
by
the
patent
and
its
expectation
that
the
petitioner
would
pay
royalties.
petitioner
did
not
think
royalties
were
owing
believing
that
the
cabilly
ii
patent
was
invalid
and
that
its
claims
were
in
any
event
not
infringed
by
synagis.
nevertheless,
petitioner
considered
the
letter
to
be
of
clear
threat
to
enforce
the
cabilly
ii
patent,
terminate
the
license
agreement
and
sue
for
patent
infringement
if
petitioner
did
not
make
the
requested
royalty
payments.
if
respondents
were
to
prevail
in
a
patent
infringement
action,
petitioner
could
be
ordered
to
pay
trouble
damages
and
attorney’s
fees
and
could
be
enjoined
from
selling
synagis,
a
product
that
had
accounted
for
more
than
80%
of
its
sales
revenue.
unwilling
to
risk
such
serious
consequences,
petitioner
paid
the
demanded
royalties
under
protest.
petitioner
subsequently
filed
this
lawsuit
seeking
among
other
things
a
declaratory
judgment
that
no
royalties
are
owing
under
its
license
agreement
and
that
the
cabilly
ii
patent
is
invalid,
unenforceable
and
not
infringed
by
petitioner’s
product.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
declaratory
judgment
claims
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
under
federal
circuit
president,
a
patent
licensee
in
good
standing
cannot
establish
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy
with
regard
to
validity,
enforceability
or
scope
of
the
patent.
the
federal
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
declaratory
judgment
act
authorizes
a
district
court
to
issue
declaratory
relief
“in
a
case
of
actual
controversy
within
its
jurisdiction.”
the
phrase
case
of
actual
controversy
in
the
act
refers
to
the
type
of
cases
and
controversies
that
are
justiciable
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
article
iii
requirement
would
have
been
there,
if
petitioner
had
taken
the
final
step
of
refusing
to
make
royalty
payments
under
its
licensing
agreement.
but
the
continuation
of
royalty
payments
makes
what
would
otherwise
be
an
imminent
threat
at
least
remote,
if
not
indeed
non-existent.
as
long
as
those
payments
are
made
there
is
no
risk
that
respondent’s
will
seek
to
enjoin
petitioner’s
sales.
petitioner’s
own
acts
in
other
words
eliminate
the
eminent
threat
of
harm.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
this
clause
is
the
dispute
no
longer
to
be
a
case
or
controversy
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii.
where
threatened
action
by
government
is
concerned,
it
has
long
been
clear
that
a
plaintiff
need
not
expose
himself
to
liability
before
bringing
suit
to
challenge
of
the
basis
for
the
threat,
for
example,
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
that
is
threatened
to
be
enforced
against
him.
the
plaintiff’s
own
action
or
inaction
in
failing
to
violate
the
law
eliminates
the
imminent
threat
of
prosecution
but
nonetheless
does
not
eliminate
article
iii
jurisdiction
because
the
threat
eliminating
behavior
was
effectively
coerced.
supreme
court
jurisprudence
is
more
rare
concerning
application
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
situations
in
which
the
plaintiff’s
self-avoidance
of
imminent
injury
is
coerced
by
threatened
enforcement
action
of
a
private
party
rather
than
of
the
government.
lower
courts
however
have
long
accepted
the
jurisdiction
in
such
cases.
the
only
supreme
court
decision
in
point
is
fortuitously
close
on
its
facts
to
the
case
before
us.
in
a
case
called
altvater
v.
freeman,
we
held
that
a
licensee’s
failure
to
seize
its
payment
of
royalties
did
not
render
non-justiciable,
a
dispute
over
the
validity
of
the
patent.
we
concluded
that
“the
requirements
of
a
case
or
controversy
are
met
where
payment
of
a
claim
is
demanded
as
of
right
and
where
payment
is
made
but
where
the
involuntary
or
coercive
nature
of
the
exaction
preserves
the
right
to
recover
the
sums
paid
or
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
claim.”
the
coercion
we
referred
to
was
similar
to
the
coercion
at
issue
here,
namely
the
risk
of
“not
only
actual
but
trouble
damages
in
infringement
suits.”
respondents
assert
that
this
case
hinged
upon
the
fact
that
the
licensee
was
also
subject
to
an
injunction
but
we
do
not
think
that
to
be
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
opinion.
respondents
assert
that
the
parties
in
effect
settle
this
dispute
when
they
entered
into
the
license
agreement.
when
a
licensee
enters
such
an
agreement,
they
content,
it
essentially
purchases
an
insurance
policy
immunizing
it
from
suits
for
infringement
so
long
as
it
continues
to
pay
royalties
and
does
not
challenge
the
covered
patents.
permitting
it
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patent
without
terminating
or
breaking
the
agreement,
alters
the
deal,
allowing
the
licensee
to
continue
to
enjoy
its
immunity
while
bringing
the
suit,
the
elimination
of
which
was
part
of
the
patentee’s
quid
pro
quo.
of
course,
even
if
this
argument
were
valid,
it
would
have
no
force
with
regard
to
petitioner’s
claim
that
the
agreement
does
not
call
for
royalties
because
their
product
does
not
infringe
the
patent.
but
even
as
to
the
invalidity
claim
the
points
seems
to
have
mistaken,
promising
to
pay
royalties
on
patents
that
have
not
been
held
invalid
does
not
amount
to
a
promise,
not
to
seek
a
holding
of
their
invalidity.
respondents
appeal
to
the
common
law
rule
that
a
party
to
a
contract
cannot
at
one
and
the
same
time
challenge
its
validity
and
continue
to
reap
its
benefits.
sort
of
a
dog
in
a
manger
role,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
that
rule
has
any
application
here.
petitioner
is
not
repudiating
or
impugning
the
contract
while
continuing
to
reap
its
benefits,
rather
it
is
asserting
that
the
contract
properly
interpreted
does
not
prevent
it
from
challenging
the
patents
and
does
not
require
the
payment
of
royalties
because
the
patents
do
not
cover
its
products.
of
course,
even
if
respondents
were
correct
that
the
licensing
agreement
or
the
common
law
rule
precludes
this
suit,
the
consequence
would
be
that
respondents
win
this
case
on
the
merits
not
that
article
iii
jurisdiction
is
somehow
defeated.
lastly,
respondents
urge
us
to
affirm
the
dismissal
of
the
declaratory
judgment
claims
on
discretionary
grounds;
declaratory
judgment
is
equitable
relief
and
in
the
exercise
of
sound
discretion
declined
to
provide
it
because
the
lower
courts
gave
no
consideration
to
discretionary
dismissal,
we
do
not
decide
the
issue.
that
question
and
any
merits
based
arguments
for
denial
of
declaratory
relief
are
available
for
consideration
on
remand.
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
