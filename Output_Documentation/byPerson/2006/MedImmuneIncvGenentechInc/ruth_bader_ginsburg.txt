against
licensees
who
are
not
claiming
that
the
patent
is
invalid?
and
where
is
the
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
i
can
see,
if
the...
if
licensee
says
the
patent
is
invalid,
that
the
patentee
says
paying
its
royalties...
how
does
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
it...
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
licensee
came
into
court
and
said,
"i'm
not
contesting
this
patent",
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
aren't
you...
you
said,
"the
only
question
before
the
court
is
jurisdictional.
"
if
that's
so,
why
isn't
your
position
that
the
federal
circuit
put
the
wrong
label
on
this,
that
license
is
listed
in
8(c)
as
an
affirmative
defense;
so,
whatever
the
outcome
should
be,
the
wrong
label
should...
is...
was
used.
it
shouldn't
be
a
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
shouldn't
be
12(b)(1);
it
should
be
an
8(c)
affirmative
defense.
and
then
the...
you're
out
of
the
jurisdiction
box,
but
you're
left
with
the
same
underlying
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--good
would
it
do?
suppose
we
said,
"federal
circuit,
you
put
the
wrong
label
on
it.
"
"it
should
be
12(b)(6),
not
12(b)(1),
or
perhaps
even
8(c),
affirmative
defense?
"
then
you
go
back
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
they'll
come
up
with
the
same
decision,
that,
as
long
as
you
are
licensed
and
are
paying
your
royalties,
you
have...
and
they
just
put
a
different
label
on
it...
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
no...
you
have
not
stated
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
federal
circuit
distinguished
lear,
and
said
what...
in
lear,
the
licensee
had
stopped
paying
royalties.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
are
those
ways...
i
mean,
the
ones
that
have
been
mentioned
as
possibilities
in
the
government
brief...
one,
you
rejected,
and
the
other
that
was
mentioned
was:
if
you
sue...
if
the
licensee
sues,
then
the
royalty
fees
will
be
upped.
would
that
be
effective?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
have
rejected
both
of
the
government's
suggestions
on
what
the
patent
holder
might
do
to
protect
itself.
do
you
have
anything
concrete
that
you
would
concede
the
patent
holder
could
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
case
about
article
iii
case
or
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question
that
is
presented
to
us...
whatever
they
suggested
at
this
oral
argument
that
wasn't
in
iii,
the
question
it
presented
to
us
is,
was
the
federal
circuit
right
when
they
said,
"you
have
no
access
to
a
declaratory
judgment
unless
there
is
a
reasonable
apprehension
that
you
will
be
sued?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--patent
holder
take
the
position
that,
"i...
sooner
or
later,
i'm
going
to
have
to
fight
out
validity
with
someone,
and
might
as
well
do
it
sooner
rather
than
later,
so
i
am
not
going
to
raise
the
license
as
a
defense?
"
would
that
be
a
"case
or
controversy"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
it's...
no,
the
patent...
the
licensee
is
coming
into
court
and
wants
a
declaration
of
invalidity
so
it
can
manufacture
without
the
fear
of
an
infringement
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
patent
holder
chooses
not
to
plead
the
license...
chooses
not
to
plead
the
license.
wouldn't
the
patent
holder
have
that
option?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
their
view.
i
mean,
they
start
a
lawsuit.
they
say,
"we're...
we
want"--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"#
we
want
a
declaration
of
infringement.
"
and
the
patent
holder
doesn't
take
the
position
that
you're
taking;
instead
says,
"i'm
prepared
to
fight
this
out
now.
"
"i
know
that
i
have
the
license,
which
could
be
an
affirmative
defense,
but
i'm
not
going
to
raise
it.
"
"i'm
going
to
go
head
to
head
on
the
validity
of
this
patent.
"
would
that
be
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
if
the
patent
holder
chooses
not
to
raise
the
license,
the
court
would
have
to,
on
its
own
motion,
say,
"sorry,
you
didn't...
you're
not
the
master
of
your
defense.
"
"we
decide
that
you
have
to
effectively
plead
the
license.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
remember
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
wasn't...
the
district
court,
in
this
very
case,
seemed
to
say,
"i
think
this
suit
should
go
forward,
but
there's
gen-probe,
and
i
must
follow
gen-probe.
"
the
district
court,
at
least
as
i
read
it,
seemed
to
think
that
gen-probe
moved
in
a
different
direction
from
where
the
federal
circuit
was
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what...
but
jurisdiction
is
a
question
of
power,
does
the
court
have
the
power
to
do
this?
a
discretion
question
is
different.
it's,
"we
have
the
power
to
entertain
this
case,
but,
as
a
matter
of
equity,
we're
not
going
to
do
so.
"
the
power
question,
i
think,
is
a...
one
that's...
it's
either
yes
or
no,
either
the
court
has
the
power,
or
doesn't.
