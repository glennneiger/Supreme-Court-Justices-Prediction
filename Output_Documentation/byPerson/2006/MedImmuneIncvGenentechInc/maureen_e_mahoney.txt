ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
fact
that
there
are
four
counts
in
the
complaint
for
declaratory
relief.
the
first
one
is
styled
as
a...
contractual
relations
claims.
the
other
three
are
styled
as
patent
law
claims.
and
it's
important
to
emphasize,
at
the
outset,
that
this
court,
in
skelly
oil,
in
calderone,
and
in,
really,
all
of
the
cases,
has
said
it's
very
important
to
look
behind
the
labels
that
a
declaratory
judgment
act
plaintiff
puts
on
their
claims.
we
need
to
actually
see
what
is
the
cause
of
action
they're
trying
to
adjudicate
so
we
can
do
an
accurate
assessment
of
justiciability...
standing,
ripeness,
federal-question
jurisdiction.
i
want
to
start
by
explaining
why
there
is
no
contract
claim
at
issue
here.
you
heard
today,
they're
trying
to
salvage
this,
say
that
there's
a
contract
dispute,
a
dispute
about
the
terms
of
the
contract.
they
didn't
argue
that
below,
and
with
good
reason.
and
i'd
just
point
you
to
the
briefs
in
the
federal
circuit.
roman
numeral
i,
which
is
all
about
the
improper
dismissal
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
claims,
refers
to
the
fact
these
are,
quote,
27.
nowhere
do
they
say
that
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
contract
terms.
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
contract
terms,
which
were
just
read
to
you,
is
section
110
of...
1.10
at
ja-399
of
the
license...
says
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
pay
royalties
for
synagis
on
any
claim...
not
any
valid
claim,
any
claim...
that
has
not
been
held
invalid
by
a
court
or
other
competent
jurisdiction
from
which
no
appeal
has,
or
may,
be
taken.
now,
they
never
said,
below,
"that
clause
means
that
we
can
come
to
court
and
have
the
court
decide
whether
this
patent
is
valid,
and,
depending
on
whether
we
win
or
not,
then
we
can
stop
paying.
"
and
the
reason
they
didn't
make
that
argument
is,
it
was
rejected
by
this
court
a
hundred
years
ago,
in
united
states
versus
harvey
steel.
very
similar
clause.
the
united
states
says,
"this
means
that
we
don't
have
to
pay
if
the
patent
is
invalid.
"
and,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
holmes,
this
court
rejected
it
out
of
hand
by...
and
said,
"this
was
a
conventional
proviso.
"
"we
don't
even
need
to
look
to
evidence
of
the
party's
intent,
because
this
is
the
standard
proviso.
"
"it
does
not
mean.
"
--and
they
said
it
was
a
"twisted
interpretation"
that
the
government
was
offering...
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
licensee,
quote,
"thought
the
patent
bad
and
would
like
to
have
the
court
say
so
now.
"
end
quote.
yet
that
is
exactly--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
is,
in
the
following
sense,
your
honor.
they
can't
just
show
up
here
today
and
say,
"well,
there
really
is
a
dispute
about
the
contract.
"
but
they
never
argued,
below,
and
is
foreclosed--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
this
issue,
whether
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
a
real
live
contract
dispute,
they
never
argued
it,
your
honor.
it's
not
part
of
this
case.
the
federal
circuit
didn't
address
it,
because
they
didn't
argue
it,
because
it's
foreclosed
by--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--a
precedent
a
hundred--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
that
is
the
right...
that
is
the
right
starting
point
for
a
test,
depending
on
the
cause
of
action
they're
seeking
to
adjudicate.
in
here,
what
the
federal
circuit
properly
understood
is
that
they
are
seeking
to
adjudicate
affirmative
defenses
to
an
infringement
action
under
the
patent
laws.
and,
just
like
in
steffel,
if
you're
trying
to
adjudicate,
on
an
anticipatory
basis,
an
enforcement
action,
you
have
to
show
that
you
would
reasonably
fear
that
enforcement
action.
and,
in
fact,
steffel
uses
that
language,
and
poe
versus
ullman
dismisses
a
case
for
failure
to
establish
a
genuine
fear
of
prosecution.
but
then,
you
have
to
go
one
step
beyond,
and
that
is
to
say,
are
they...
is
the
cause
of
action
not
ripening
because
the
declaratory
judgment
plaintiff
is
forfeiting
their
legal
rights
in
order
to
avoid
some
very
severe
harm
that
would
be
cognizable
coercion?
that's
the
test
that's
used
in
steffel
for...
in
essence,
being
able
to
test
a...
defenses
to
a
cause
of
action
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--an
enforcement
action.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
doesn't
work
here,
for
several
reasons.
most
fundamentally,
this
is
a
settlement.
i
mean,
mr.
steffel
did
not
enter
into
a
settlement
or
a
compromise
with
the
prosecutor.
he
wasn't
complying
because
he
was
under
an
agreement
to
do
so.
here,
it
has
been
settled
for...
forever,
that
if
a...
an
agreement...
if
you're
making
payments
pursuant
to
an
agreement,
in
the
nature
of
a
compromise,
you
can't
come
and
say
that
it's
been
coerced
or
it's
a
form
of
duress.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
answer,
your
honor,
is,
they
weren't
settling,
for
all
time,
in
the
sense
that
they
could
never
get
out
of
the
deal.
certainly,
they
could
repudiate
and
then
go
ahead
and
sue.
but
yet,
at
page
3
of
their
petition,
they
expressly
say,
the
reason
they
entered
into
this
agreement
was
in
order
to
avoid
the
costs
and
risks
of
litigation.
it
is
the
reason--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--not
exactly,
but
what
they
did
was
they
headed
it
off
at
the
pass.
they
understood
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it's
a
compromise.
it's
a
compromise
of
the
very
claims
they're
trying
to
adjudicate
here.
what
they
want
to
adjudicate
are
affirmative
defenses
to
a
patent
infringement
action.
that
is
not
a
ripe
claim,
and
there
is
not
sufficient
immediacy,
because
they
are
preventing
that
claim
from
ripening
by
continuing
to
make
voluntary
payments--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--under
their--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--agreement.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
know
if
it's
exactly
the
status.
for
instance,
in
a
settlement
after
litigation
has
been
filed,
i
think
that
lear
would
say
that
you
can't
even
repudiate
that.
but
certainly...
so,
there
might
be
some
differences...
but
from--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
standpoint
of
coercion--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
is
equivalent
to
that,
in
the
following
sense.
they
understood
that
if
they...
if
they
didn't
get
a
license,
that
they
would
be
exposed
to
genentech's
claims
under
the...
under
the
infringement
laws.
and
in
order
to
avoid
that
exposure,
even
though
they
had
all
the
information
they
needed
to
assess
the
validity
of
this
patent
at
the
time--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
unless--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they
did.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it's
a
compromise
of
claims
that
could
be
brought.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
but
that
would
certainly
be
a
closer
case
if
there--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
real
issue,
in
terms
of
steffel,
is
whether
you
can
say
that
the
party
is
being
coerced.
and,
at
least
in
your
hypothetical,
you
could
say
that
they
have--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
in
terms
of
whether
they're...
if
the
parties
expressly
agreed
that
that
was
part
of
their
deal,
then
you
at
least
wouldn't
say
that
there
was
an
issue
of
coercion.
but
here,
that
isn't
what
happened.
instead,
they
used--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--a
standard
proviso--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
probably
not,
your
honor.
i
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that
that's
one
of
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--one
of
the
problems--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--uh-huh.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
uh-huh.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
what
they're
really
asking
for
is
advice
about
a
business
deal
under
those
circumstances.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but...
you
know,
but
now...
but
now,
can
they
come
even
before
they
sign
the
deal?
in
other
words,
what's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
line?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
in
other
words--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i...
no.
oh,
no,
i'm
just
saying--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
the
problem...
i
think
the
problem
is,
it...
is,
it
leads
notion
that
parties
can
simply,
sort
of,
set
up
a...
even
if
there's
not
true
adversity,
and
come
to
court
for
answers
to
legal
questions.
and
that
has--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--is
something--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
license
agreement
itself
is
invalid.
it
simply--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--means--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--not
on
that
patent.
right.
the
license--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--made.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if
the
patent
has
been...
under
lear
and
other
cases,
if
a
patent
has
been
held
to
be
invalid
by
a
final
decision
of
a
court,
then
i
think
it
is
improper
for
a
licensee
to
seek
to
obtain--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--royalties--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--for
that.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
under
the...
under
the
current
state
of
the
law.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that
if,
under
the...
i'm
sorry,
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--uh-huh.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
dispute
would
be
about,
your
honor,
because
it
sounds
like
the
contract
terms
would
be
clear.
and
if
the
contract
terms
are
clear,
they
would
simply
go
in
accordance,
unless
they
have
an
argument
that
the
contract
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--unenforceable.
if
the...
if
the
point
is
that
it
is
actually
invalid,
illegal,
that...
that
may
be
a
different
case,
although
i
think
there
would
still
be
an
estoppel
argument,
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
bring
that
action
without
giving
up
the
benefits
of
the
bargain,
which
is
the
immunity
from
suit.
i
mean,
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
with
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
difference,
from
a
jurisdictional
perspective--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
i
think,
here,
that
the
major
problem,
from
a
jurisdictional
perspective,
is
that
there
is
not
anything
in
the
language
of
the
contract
that
gives
them
a
right
to
come
to
court
to
dispute
validity.
instead,
we're--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that
makes
no
difference,
your
honor.
the
fact
is
that
they
are
making
the
payments
pursuant
to
an
agreement.
they're
not
under
compulsion
of
an
injunction.
they're
doing
it
because
they
voluntarily
entered
into
it.
altvater
is
completely
different.
there,
there
was
no
license
agreement
in
force.
the
courts
found
that
it...
that
the
reissue
patents
were
never
part
of
the
agreement,
to
begin
with.
in
other
words,
altvater
never
agreed
to
pay
royalties.
altvater
had
been
sued,
so
there
wasn't
a
counterclaim
for
invalidity.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
that
the
patent
holder
is
allowed
to
come
to
court
and
seek
a
declaration
of
validity.
i
don't
think
any
court
has
ever
allowed
that.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
and
they're
under
a
license?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
the
patent...
well,
no.
i
mean,
not
necessarily.
their
view
is
that,
because
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
that
the
patent
holder
has
no
choice
but
to...
because
they're
receiving
the
royalties,
to
simply--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
that
is...
that's
what
happened
here.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
the
parties
are
allowed
to
just
decide,
"well,
we'd
like
to
do
this
now.
"
when
they're--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they've
treated--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
they
are
here
pursuant
to...
that
they
have
a
legal
right
that
permits
them
to
adjudicate
the
issue
of
validity.
what
the...
what
the
patent
owner
does,
or
not,
i
don't
think
turns
this
into
a
case
or
controversy;
that,
instead,
we
have
to
start
with
the
fundamental
question,
"what
is
the
cause
of
action
that
they
are
attempting
to
adjudicate?
"
"is
it
a
contract
action
or
is
it
a...
an
action
under
the
patent
laws?
"
"is
it
an
infringement
action?
"
here,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
it
is...
they're
trying
to
adjudicate
an
action
for
an
infringement
that
can't
arise,
because
they're
immune
from
suit,
because
they
continue
to
make
their
payments.
and,
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
not
sufficiently
immediate
to
establish
jurisdiction
in--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--this
court.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
poe
versus
ullman,
this
court
actually
dismissed
a
declaratory
judgment--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--we--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well...
but
in
poe
versus
ullman,
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
they
were
seeking
to
have
a
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
and
this
court
did
dismiss,
because
they
didn't
have
a
reasonable
fear
that
they
would
actually
be
prosecuted.
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
even--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
you
could...
you
could...
i'm
not...
it
is
possible
that
that
framework
could
be
extended.
i...
it
has
not
been
done
to
date,
and
it
would
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
does.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
there
is
always
a
reasonable
apprehension,
and
there
was
always
a
finding
of
coercion.
poe
versus
ullman
says
you
can't
do
it
unless
there
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
why
they
didn't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that...
it
goes
to
the
next
point,
which
is
that
there
still
has
to
be
a
coercive
choice.
you
have
to
choose...
there,
they're
choosing
to
give
up
constitutional
rights
in
order
to
avoid
jail
and
imprisonment,
arrest
and
prosecution.
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--what's
at
issue--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
like
violating
the
contract
here,
though,
your
honor,
because,
what
are
the
consequences
here?
what
is
the
choice?
first
of
all,
they
actually
owe
the
royalties
under
the
agreement,
so
they're
trying
to
escape
their
bargain,
not
enforce
it.
that's
number
one.
so,
they're
not
forfeiting
any
rights
under
the
contract,
they're
simply
trying
to
get
out
of
the
contract.
number
two,
the
consequences
here,
the
choice
they're
talking
about,
isn't
in
the
nature
of
coercion.
again,
they're
not
being
arrested
or
prosecuted.
all
they're
going
to
do
if
they
walk
out
of
this
agreement,
if
they
stop
paying
royalties...
yes,
they
may
well
be
sued
for
infringement...
but,
if
they
do,
all
they
face
is
the
loss
of
their
discount.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it's
not
based
on
them
giving
up
their
right
to
sue,
in
the
sense
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
stop
paying
royalties,
and
they
can
sue.
they
have
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
compromise,
your
honor,
and
there's
nothing
in
this
agreement
that
gives
them
a
right
to
sue.
they
have
to
find
some
legal
right.
what
they're
really
saying...
what
their
argument
has
always
been
is
that
lear
actually
creates
an
implied
right
of
action
for
a
licensee
to
sue
at
any
time
of
their
choosing.
that's
been
their
argument
from
the
beginning.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
true.
but
that's
getting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
what
this
court
said
in--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--u.s.
v.
harvey
steel
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
every
single
contract
case
in
the
lower
courts
where
they
have
allowed
a
suit
to
be
brought
on
a
contract
prior
to
breach,
there
was
a
genuine
dispute
about
the
interpretation
of
the
terms.
here,
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
adjudicate
a
cause
of
action
outside
of
the
contract.
they're
trying
to
adjudicate
an
infringement
action
and
then
say,
"aha,
see
what
i
have?
"
"i
have
a
judgment
that
the
patent's
invalid.
"
"and
so,
now
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
don't
have
to
pay
royalties
under
my
contract.
"
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
as
a...
i
do
not
agree
that
it
came
as
a
shock.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
that
warner
jenkinson,
which
is
a
second
circuit
case
that
allowed
this
kind
of
action
back
in
the
'70s,
was
one
of
the
only
cases
ever
that
allowed
it.
and
other
reasons
were
found
to
dismiss
similar
kinds
of
claims.
in
gen-probe,
it
was
a
surprise
that
a
licensee
could
do
this.
it...
the
law...
by
the
time
that
this
license
was
executed
in
the
federal
circuit,
there
was
a
case,
called
shell
oil,
where
the
court
specifically
held
that
a
licensee
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
protections
of
lear
until
it
has
repudiated
the
license,
stopped
paying,
and
said
that
it
wants
to
challenge
validity.
so
that
was
the
background
rule
that
was
in
force
at
the
time
of
this
license.
and
then,
when
you
couple
that
with
the
fact
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--in
all
of
the
prior
federal
circuit
cases,
the
licensee
had
stopped
paying
royalties.
and
what
the
court
explained
in
gen-probe
is
that
that
is
the
sine
qua
non,
that
a
licensee
can't
establish
jurisdiction,
and
it
can't
establish
a
right
to
challenge
validity,
if
it's
still
paying
royalties.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
you
can,
because
i
think
that
you
can
do
it
as
an
alternative
threshold
prudential
jurisdictional
dismissal
in
the
nature--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
a
prudential
dismissal
under
article
iii
would
also
be
fine,
and
that
steel
co.
would
allow
for
that
kind
of
dismissal,
because
wilton
said
that
you
can
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
at
the
front
end,
on
prudential
grounds
if
you
know
that
there
would
not
be
relief
allowed
at
the
back
end.
and
i
think
that
there's
no
need
for
a
remand
to
do
this.
we
are
really
talking
about
an
equitable
rule
that
has
governed
equitable
actions
for
300
years.
it
is
a--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
answer
that
question
in
order
to
dismiss
on
a
prudential
ground,
a
prudential
jurisdictional
ground,
and
nor
is
there
a
need
for
a
remand
in
samuels
versus
mackell,
and
in
cardinal,
for
instance.
those
are
cases
where
the
court
adopted
prudential
rules
and
went
ahead
and
applied
them
without
remand.
i...
and
no
remand's
necessary.
the
federal
circuit
has
already
looked
at
this.
they--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
would
depend
on
whether
there
is
an
implied
covenant,
your
honor.
it
wasn't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--argued
below.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
it...
it
may
well
be,
but
i
don't
think
the
answer
in
this
case
turns
on
it,
because
i
think
they
have
to
have
their
own
right
to
bring
the
action,
whether
it's
a
breach
or
not,
and
that
they
don't.
because
they
don't
have
an
implied
right
of
action
under
lear,
they
don't
have
a
right
to
bring
this
action.
and
that
is
an
essential
component
of
their
ability
to
challenge
the
issue
of
validity.
so,
i
think
that's
the
first
and
fundamental--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
their
theory,
your
honor,
is
that
a
licensee
can
do
this
at
any
time,
and
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
don't
think...
whether
it's
an
implied
covenant
or
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
an
additional
factor
that
bears
on
this
analysis
is
also
the
fact
that
congress
has
never
created
an
implied
right
of...
has
never
created
a
right
of
action--
thank
you,
your
honor.
