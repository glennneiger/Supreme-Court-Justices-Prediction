justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is...
if...
i
guess
there
are
three
possible
positions
on
the
question
of
whether
a
licensee
can
attack
a
contract,
a
patent
where
he
has
a
license
and
wants
to
keep
the
contract.
one,
he
can
never
do
it.
two,
he
can
always
do
it.
three,
it
depends
on
what
the
contract
says.
now,
do
any
of
those
questions
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
before
us,
which
is
whether
it
is
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
we
were
to
reach
the
question,
which
is
very
interesting,
"what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
which
of
those
three
positions
is
the
right
position?
"
--were
we
to
reach
it...
i
agree
with
you,
i
don't
see
it
in
front
of
us;
but
maybe
it
is...
if
it
were,
what
would
be
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
basically,
though,
you're
not
certain.
the
government's
view
would
be,
it
is
a
matter
as
to
whether
you
can
sue
claiming
the
patent
is
invalid,
whether
the
licensee
can
do
it,
that
probably...
but
you're
not
certain,
and
you
haven't
made
up
your
mind
definitely,
because
it
is
not
in
this
case...
but
you
think
it's
going
to
be
something
they
could
regulate
themselves
by
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
shouldn't
we
send
that
back?
i
mean,
i
thought
we
were
here
to
decide
one
question,
that
the
federal
circuit
has
said
that,
"unless
there
is
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
a
lawsuit,
you
can't
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
because
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
"
now,
i
have
to
admit,
i've
looked
up,
or
i've
had
my
law
clerk
look
up,
probably
now
hundreds
of
cases,
and
we
can't
find,
in
any
case,
such
a
requirement.
indeed,
the
very
purpose...
as
i...
we've
just
heard
the
sg
say,
of
this
act,
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
seems
to
be
to
allow
people
who...
a
contract...
who
are
in
a
real
concrete
disagreement,
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
without
getting
rid
of
the
contract.
but
i
might
be
wrong
about
that.
but
you've
now
argued
a
different
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
isn't
the
right
thing
for
us
to
do,
to
decide
the
issue
in
front
of
us
and
then
send
it
back?
if
you're
right
that
they
have
to
pay,
whether
they
win
or
lose;
if
they're
right
that
they
promise
not
to
sue;
if
you're
right
on
14
other
grounds,
you
might
win.
but
should
we
decide
those
grounds
today?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--will
you
assume
justice
stevens'
hypothetical?
assume
it,
take
it
as
given.
they
did
put
that
in.
i
know
you
think
they
didn't,
but
i
want
to
assume
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'd
like
to
also
assume--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
hypothetical
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
they
write
into
the
contract...
the
party
who's
the
licensee
says,
"and
we
stipulate
that
the
licensee
thinks
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
"
nonetheless,
the
licensee
wants
a
license,
for
business
reasons.
therefore,
the
licensee
and
the
licensor
agrees
that,
after
they
sign
the
contract
and
he's
paying
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
in
royalties,
he
can
go
into
court
and
challenge
the
patent.
"so,
we
assume
that's
written
into
the
contract.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
let
us
also
assume
a
state
of
the
law.
the
state
of
the
law
is
that
there
is
no
public
policy
or
any
other
policy
that
forbids
such
a
condition
in
a
contract.
all
right?
now,
on
those
two
assumptions,
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
that
the
licensee
asks
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
on
those
assumptions,
is
there
a
case
or
controversy
under
the
federal
constitution?
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
says,
by
the
way,
"if
i
win,
i
will,
in
fact,
save
$42
billion
a
year
in
licenses.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
i
would
other
have
to
pay.
"
and
the
other
side
will...
or...
i
was
a
thousand
dollars,
i
meant
42
billion,
okay?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
now,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
is,
under
other
fields
of
the
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
i
imagine
that
the
very...
we
see,
all
the
time,
declaratory
judgments
where
a
state
passes
a
law
and
the
individual
says,
"well,
i
think
this
is
unconstitutional,
but
my
preferences
are
not
to
go
to
jail;
my
preferences
are
not
to
be
penalized.
"
"so,
my
first
choice
is
unconstitutional
and
my
second
is
to
obey
it.
"
there's
no
possibility
in
the
world
that
he
will
violate
that
law.
and
yet,
we've
often
held
that,
with
regulations,
you
have
to
have
the
other
requirements.
you
have
to
have
the
requirements
that
it's
concrete,
it's
not
just
ideological,
there's
real
harm.
but,
if
those
other
requirements
that
are
fulfilled,
i've
never
seen
any
where
it
said
that
there
also
has
to
be
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
a
lawsuit
in
the
absence
of
the
declaratory
judgment.
i've
just
never
found
that
phrase,
and
i
can't
imagine
why
it
would
be
part
of
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
there
are
many
dismissed,
for
the
reasons
that
they
aren't
concrete,
definite...
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
to
dismiss
it.
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
is
an
additional
reason
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
a
lawsuit
in
the
absence
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
it's
that
phrase
that
i've
never
found
anywhere--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
can't
think
of
any
reason
why
that
would
be
an
additional
constitutional
requirement.
and
i'm
putting
that
directly
to
you,
because
i
want
to
hear
you
give
me
the
counterexamples.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
there
has
never
been
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
except
in
the
instance
where,
in
the
absence
of
the
action,
the
person
would
have
violated
the
law,
if
it's
a
government
law.
in
other
words,
if
they're...
so,
it's
really
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
think
as
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--both
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
government
area,
it
happens--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
