chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
medimmune,
incorporated,
versus
genentech.
mr.
kester.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kester,
would
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--would
it...
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
contract
contained
a
specific...
the
license...
a
specific
provision
specifying
that
the
licensee
may
not
sue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you...
do
you
think
such
a
provision
would
be
enforceable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
look
at
what
might
be
a
matter
of
jurisdictional
law.
i
take
it,
from
your
position,
there's
nothing
preventing
genentech
from
suing,
either,
is
there?
in
other
words,
to
establish
the
validity
of
their
patent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
against
licensees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
the
patentee
would
just
say,
"look,
we
have
a
license.
"
"i
think
the
patent's
valid,
and
you
owe
me
a
dollar
a
unit.
"
the
licensee
said,
"well,
i
don't
think
they're...
it's
valid,
so
i
owe
you
nothing.
"
and
they
settle
on
a
license
for
50
cents.
why
can't
the
patentee
say,
"you
know,
if
i
get
a
judicial
decision
establishing
that
the
patent
is
valid,
i
can
charge
a
higher
license,
either
when
this
agreement
expires
or
for
other
licenses?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
see
how
far
you
want...
are
willing
to
push
your
argument
that
just
because
there's
been
an
agreement,
or
perhaps
even
a
settlement,
that
that
somehow
or
another
doesn't
moot
the
controversy,
the
underlying
legal
dispute.
and
it...
i
gather
your
answer
to
me
is
that
genentech,
or
a
patentee,
can
sue,
even
though
they
have
an
existing...
they're
getting
royalties
from
the
licensee,
they
can
still
sue
the
licensee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
there's
no
way,
i...
under
your
view,
that
a
patent
holder
can
protect
itself
from
suit
through
any
license
arrangement
or
any
agreement
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
don't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
don't
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
why
are
you
paying
it,
if
you...
if
you
don't
think
you
owe
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
of
the
threat
of
treble
damages--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we're
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
public
policy
is
here,
why
don't
we
give
some
weight
to
those
congressional
enactments
that
obviously
fortify
the
strength
of
the
patent?
in
other
words,
congress
passed
these
provisions
providing
for
treble
damages
for
attorneys'
fees.
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
to
respond
that
there's
got
to
be
a
public
policy
to
counterbalance
that,
congress
can
always
do
that,
if
it
wants;
but
it
didn't...
it
thinks
that
you
need
these
provisions
to
protect
the
patent
holders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kester.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
ever
end
these
things?
let's
say
they
have
this
dispute,
they
bring
the
litigation,
and
they
settle
it.
they're
saying,
"okay,
we're
going
to
settle
it.
"
"instead
of
paying
a
license
fee
of
50
cents,
it's
going
to
be
40
cents,
and
we'll
go
on.
"
then
they
can
sue
again,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
they
settle
that,
by
the
way?
is
it
all
right
to
settle
it,
or
is...
that
interfere
with
the
policy
that
patents
have
to
be
open
to
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
either
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
overread
pope.
all
pope
said
was
that
they're
not
going
to
grant
specific
performance.
in
fact,
they've
said,
"whatever
you
may
think
of
the
policy
here,
we
don't...
specific
performance
calls
on
the
equitable
discretion,
and
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
"
but,
i
don't
read
pope
as
holding
that
the
clauses
are
otherwise
unenforceable.
in--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--other
words
you're
maybe
entitled
to
damages.
and
that
may
be
measured
by
the
license
fee
that
you
agreed
to
pay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
think
that
matters,
though,
do
you?
i
mean,
even
if
they
all
agree
there's
no
dispute
about
what
the
license
agreement
means,
your
position
is
still
the
same,
right?
there
is
an
article
iii
controversy
because
they
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
always
the
case?
i
mean,
could...
can
you
enforce
a
license
agreement
based
on
an
invalid
patent?
you
thought
it
was
valid...
parties
had
a
dispute
about
it...
whether
it
is
valid.
you
entered
into
agreement,
say,
"well,
let's
split
the
difference.
"
"we'll...
you
know,
50
cents
rather
than
a
dollar
or
nothing.
"
it's
determined
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
can
the
patentee
then
still
say,
"well,
you
still
owe
me
the
money.
"
"we've,
kind
of,
cut...
split
the
difference.
"
"that
was
part
of
the
agreement?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that...
it's
been
pointed
out
that
was
pursuant
to
an
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
think
there
would
be
a
case
or
controversy
if
genentech
were
suing
to
establish
the
validity
of
its
patent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--true
adversity?
i
thought
the
assumption
underlying
the...
everybody's
hypothetical
is
that,
if
the
patent
is
determined
to
be
invalid,
that
the
license...
then
the
license
agreement
is
also
invalid.
is
that...
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you...
can
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
you
collect...
can
a
patentee
collect
license
fees
based
on
an...
patent
that
has
been
determined
to
be
invalid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
be
pursuant
to
the
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
collective--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
royalty
agreement
says,
you
know,
"we
have
a
dispute
about
the
validity
of
this
patent.
"
"we
don't
know.
"
"we
disagree.
"
"and
so,
we've
entered
into
a
compromise
royalty
rate
that
reflects
the
uncertainty.
"
but
once
it's
determined
to
be
invalid,
the
license
fees
are
not
collectible.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
argument...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
fact
that
it's
under
protest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
their
concrete
right
is,
as
i
thought
you
conceded
earlier,
that
if
the
patent
is
declared
invalid,
they
will
not
owe
license
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
declaratory
judgment
action
does,
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
mahoney,
you
argue,
in
the
alternative,
that
we
should
dismiss
it
on
the
basis
of
equitable
considerations
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
we
can't
reach
that
argument
unless
we
rule
against
you
on
the
article
iii
question.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
would
have
to
be
assuming
that
we
had
jurisdiction,
wouldn't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
article
iii?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
kester,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
was
it
raised
before
the
federal
circuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kester.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
