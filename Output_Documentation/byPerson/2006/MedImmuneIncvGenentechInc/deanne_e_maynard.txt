ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
concrete
dispute
between
the
parties
about
their
legal
rights
and
obligations.
if
that
dispute
is
resolved,
money
will
change
hands.
that
is
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
:
in
that
situation.
recognizing
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--may
i...
if
i
can
answer
the
first
question
first.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
there
were
to
be
a
settlement,
in
the
second
case,
the...
it
would
not
be
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy
problem
with
the
second
case.
and
that
suit
should
not
be
dismissed
under
12(b)(1).
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the...
in
that
case,
the
patent
holder
might
have
a
valid
12(b)(6)
defense,
and
the
suit,
laying
aside
enforceability
issues
that
you
raised,
may
be
easily
resolved,
on
that
ground.
but,
in
terms
of
the
question
before
the
court
today,
that
wouldn't
be
an
article
iii
matter.
i
think,
as
a
policy
matter...
so,
moving
off
the
question
before
the
court
right
now...
as
a
policy
matter,
the...
it's
not
clear
from
this
court's
cases
exactly
what
types
of
agreements
would
be
enforceable.
i
think
there's
a
spectrum
of
cases
one
can
imagine,
ranging
from
pope...
the
type
of
promise
that
was
extracted
in
pope,
which
this
court
held
was
unenforceable--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
there
certainly
would
be
a
question,
though,
the
way
that
lear
read
pope,
and
under
lear,
about
whether
a
bare
agreement
not
to
challenge
licenses,
especially
ones
like
in
pope,
where
they
agreed
not
to
challenge
the
license,
even
beyond
the
term,
would
be
enforceable.
and
the
government
thinks
there's
a
spectrum.
one...
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
would
be
licenses
like
those
in
pope,
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
would
be
a
consent
decree
entered
after
settlement
of
a
bona
fide
patent
infringement
suit
where
the...
which
included
an
agreement
not
to
settle.
now,
that's
clearly
not
what
we
have
here.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
government's
view
is
that
there's
a
spectrum
along
the
spectrum,
and
it
would
have...
you
would
have
to
consider
each
case
on
its
terms.
and
it's
not
clear,
from
this
court's
cases,
where
the
policies
in
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it's
certainly
not
foreclosed
by
this
court's
precedent,
and
it's
an
open
question
where
the
policies...
how
they
would
weigh
out.
there's
no
language
in
this
license,
however,
suggesting
any
type
of
settlement.
and,
moreover,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
parties
here
actually
have
a
concrete
dispute
about
what
the
licensing
agreement
means.
count
one
in
the
complaint
is
asking
for
a
declaration--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
the
parties
have
a
concrete
dispute
about
the
validity
of
the
patent,
and
it
would
affect
their
rights
and
obligations
in
the
way
that
it
would
here...
in
other
words,
that
money
will
no
longer
be
due
to
the
respondents
if
the
patent's
invalid--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
might
depend
on
whether
there
was
consideration
beyond
the
patent
itself.
in
the...
in
this...
in
this
case,
though,
the
petitioner
claims
that
if
the...
if
the
patent
is
invalid,
they
no
longer
owe
licensing
fees,
and,
under
lear,
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
licensing
fees,
that
they've
paid
since
they
began
challenging,
back.
so,
it's
clear
that
under
either
the
contract
or
a
question
of--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--they
claim
that,
under
the
licensing
agreement,
they
only
owe
royalties
on
valid
claims.
that's
count
one
of
the
complaint,
in
the
(j)--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--where
does
it
appear
in
the
licensing
agreement?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
parties
actually
have
a
concrete
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
licensing
agreement
in
that
regard,
justice
scalia.
on
page
399
of
the
joint
appendix
is
the
provision
about
which
they
have
a
dispute.
and
the
language
in
there
provides
that
they
will
pay
on
substances
which
would,
if
not
licensed
under
this
agreement,
infringe
one
or
more
claims
of
either
or
both
of
the
shamir
patents,
or
coexpression
patents,
which
have
neither
expired
nor
been
held
invalid
by
a
court
or
other
body
of
competent
jurisdiction.
there
was
similar
language
in--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
what
the
government
believes,
your
honor.
it's
also...
the
licensee
also
does
not
need
to
breach
the
licensing
agreement
in
order
to
create
a
case
or
controversy.
the
licensee
is
currently
paying
royalties
that
it
does
not
believe
it
owes
and
that
it
believes
it
would
be
entitled
to
have
back
if
it
should
prevail
on
its
interpretation
of
the...
of
the
patent
and
the
licensing
agreement.
it
doesn't
have
to
make
that
injury
more
severe
by
breaching.
that's
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
altvater.
in
altvater,
royalties
were
being
demanded
and
royalties
were
being
paid,
but,
nevertheless,
this
court
held--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
it
was
pursuant
to
injunction,
but
that
was
not
important
to
the
court's
reasoning.
what
the
court
said
is,
"you
need
not
suffer
patent
damages
in
order
to
bring
the
suit.
"
not
a
contempt.
"you
need
not
breach
the
injunction
and
put
yourself
at
risk
of
treble
damages
for
infringement.
"
it
was
the
patent
damages
that
put
the
licensee
at
risk,
and
that's
the
same
risk
that
the
petitioner
faces
here
and
should
not
have
to
bear
in
order
to
bring
suit.
the
case
or
controversy
is
whether
or
not
the...
they
owe
the
royalties.
the
whole
point
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
was
to
allow
contracting
parties
not
to
have
to
sever
their
ongoing
contractual
relations
in
order
to
get
disputes
resolved
between--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--themselves.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
your
honor?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
i
do.
where
the
petitioner
claims
that
the
patent
is
invalid,
that
they
could...
that
the
petitioner's
claims
unsettles
their
right,
damages
their
property
value,
potentially,
and
that
they
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
of
validity.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
right
now--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it...
from
the
moment...
the
petitioner
has
an
argument
that
from
the
moment
it
ceased...
it
starts
claiming
that
the
patent
is
invalid
and
pays
under
protest,
that
it
is
entitled
to
those
royalties
back.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
think,
technically,
justice
scalia,
they
probably
have
a
claim
for
patent
infringement,
to
which
the
defense,
as
justice
ginsburg--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--points
out--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--would
be
an
easy
defense.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
so,
there's
not
an
article
iii
lack
of
case
or
controversy,
which
is--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--what's
the
question
before--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
court.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
you
need--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--you...
may
i
answer
that
question?
you
need
not
have
a
mirror-image
suit,
in
that
sense,
justice
scalia.
and
altvater
makes
that
clear.
in
altvater,
the
patentee's
claim
was--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--much
narrower
than
the
counterclaim;
and,
nevertheless,
the
court
allowed
that
counterclaim
to
proceed.
