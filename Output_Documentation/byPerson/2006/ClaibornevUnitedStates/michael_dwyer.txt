mr.
michael
dwyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court's
15-month
sentence
combined
with
3
years
of
supervised
release
conditioned
on
drug
treatments
and
the
acquisition
of
a
ged
was
a
reasonable
sentence.
in
the
uniform
and
constant
tradition
of
federal
criminal
sentencing,
the
district
judge
in
this
case
treated
mario
claiborne
as
an
individual.
she
considered
the
guidelines
and
after
doing
so
turned
to
the
judgment
that
3553(a)
demands
in
every
case.
she
issued
a
sentence
to
avoid
unwarranted
disparity,
to
impose
just
punishment,
and
to
ensure
that
deterrence
did
not
throw
away
mario
claiborne's
chances
to
resume
his
responsibilities
to
himself,
to
his
family,
and
to
his
community.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
contrast
to
the
district
court's
careful
attention
to
the
3553(a)
factors,
focused
solely
on
the
guidelines.
the
court
of
appeals
applied
its
extraordinary
circumstances
rule.
that
rule
re-tethers
sentencing
to
the
guideline.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
a
sentence
would
be
reasonable
if
a
reasonable
judge
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
that
case
would
find
that
the
sentence
imposed
was
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary
to
satisfy
3553(a)
standards.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
that
the
statute
speaks
of
unwarranted
disparity
and
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
uniformity.
and
there
is
necessarily
a
tension
between
the
individualized
sentencing
that
3553(a)
requires
and
concerns
about
nationwide
uniformity.
but
i
think
that
what
distinguishes
sentencing
under
the
advisory
guidelines
system
from
the
presentencing
reform
act
system
are
several.
one
is
now
we
explicitly
have
purposes
of
sentencing
and
factors
the
judge
must
consider.
3553
didn't
exist
before
that
time.
secondly,
in
every
case,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
guidelines
are
going
to
exert
a
gravitational
weight
because
they
are
there.
they
must
be
considered
as
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
don't...
my
position
would
be
that
3553(a)(4)
is
the
correct
place
for
consideration
of
the
guidelines.
it's
just
one
of
seven
factors.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
it's
going
to
get--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--as
a
legal
matter
weak.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
unfortunately
it's
going
to
be
very
strong.
and
i
think
one
of
the
real
dangers
of
an
advisory
guideline--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
think
that
the
strength
should
be
no
more
than
one
of
the
3553(a)
factors,
because
i
think
the
danger,
particularly
after
20
years
of
guideline
sentencing,
is
that
courts
will
routinely
and
mechanistically
apply
the
guidelines
instead
of
exercising
their
discretion,
which
now
runs
to
the
full
limit
of
3553(a).
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
the
appellate
courts
are...
i
think
booker
considered
a
very
deferential
standard
of
review.
the
cases
that
the
booker
court
cited
to
illustrate
the
standard
of
review
of
reasonableness
were
all
highly
deferential
decisions
regarding
revocations
following
supervised
release,
affirming
sentences
that
were
many
times
what
the
chapter
7
policy
guidelines
would
require.
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
must
be
deferential
or
i
think
it
pushes
the
system
back
into
a
mandatory--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
think
there
would,
justice
alito,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
role
of
the
appellate
court
is
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
application
and
weight
applied
to
the
3553(a)
factors
for
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
dwyer
well,
i
think
it
derives
in
part
from
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
contemplated
individualized
sentencing.
mr.
michael
dwyer
certainly
extremely
broad
discretion.
mr.
michael
dwyer
even
under
a
mandatory
guidelines
system
that
this
court
considered
in
koon,
it
recognized
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
also
had
an
important
goal
of
individualized
sentencing.
and
the
court
in
koon
recognized
that
district
courts
in
their
institutional
position
have
a
special
competence
to
determine
what's
ordinary
in
a
case,
what's
unusual
in
a
case.
the
court
of
appeals
lacks
that
special
competence.
it
sees
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
number
of
guideline
cases.
it
doesn't
have--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
think
that
what
guides
the
court
of
appeals
on
reasonableness
review
is
to
look
to
the
particular
case
and
determine
if
the
reasons
on
the
record
in
that
case,
the
district
court's--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
job
is
to
ensure
that
the
district
judge
provides
reasoned
elaboration
of
its
judgment
on
the
facts
of
that
case
that
establish
that
the
district
court
had
complied
with
3553(a),
and
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
selected
a
sentence
which
is
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
the
court
of
appeals'
job,
as
was
remarked
earlier,
to
become
a
sentencing
commission
and
begin
to
reexamine
and
reweigh
district
courts'
decisions.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
it
is
not
lawless
in
the
sense
that
courts
of
appeals
need
to
determine
whether
in
a
particular
case,
the
differences
it
finds
are
warranted
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
that
case,
whether
the
district
judge
has
consulted
the
guidelines,
has
looked
at
the
history
and
characteristics
of
that
defendant,
has
looked
at
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
crime.
and
if
those
reasons
satisfy
the
court
that
a
reasonable
judge
looking
at
those
facts--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
think
the
same
process
of
review
applies
to
each.
and
it
may
result...
and
that
process
of
review
is
on
the
record
in
that
case,
would
a
reasonable
judge
have
arrived
at
that
sentence?
and
that
review
may
result
in
both
cases
being
reversed,
one,
or
the
other,
or
neither
being
reversed.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
problem
with
that.
and
it
is
that
if...
it
reinstitutes
the
mandatory
guidelines
system.
and
i
think
if
there
is
to
be
an
effectively
advisory
system,
sentencing
cannot
center
on
the
guidelines.
the
district
judge
needs
to
be
free
to
accept
or
reject
that
advice
and
3553(a),
instead
of
the
guidelines,
becomes
the
focal
point
for
sentencing.
mr.
michael
dwyer
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
adhere
to
your
hypothetical
in
this
case.
in--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
simply
said
it
is
not
a
guidelines
sentence,
it
is
an
extraordinary
variance
and
we
are
reversing.
the
district
court
has
to
consider
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
generally
that
must
be
part
of
the
reason...
elaboration
of
judgment,
so
they
will
necessarily
be
considered
on
appeal.
but
the
notion
somehow
that
simply
because
a
sentence
is
in
the
guidelines,
all
disparity
problems
have
been
resolved,
is
clearly
not
true.
as
the
amici
briefs,
and
our
brief
have
pointed
out,
even
under
a
mandatory
guidelines
system,
racial
disparity
increased,
regional
disparity
increased.
it's
disparity
that
individualized
sentencing,
the
judicial
discretion
necessary
to
do
that
kind
of
individualized
sentencing,
can
counteract.
and
that
is
genuine
uniformity.
as...
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
koon
decision,
or
the
koon
pointed
out
borrowing
your
language
from
rivera,
the
district
court's
special
competence
to
determine
what
is
ordinary
and
unusual
is
exactly
the
kind
of
information
the
sentencing
commission
needs
to
determine
whether
a
guideline
works
or
doesn't
work.
mr.
michael
dwyer
yeah.
and
i
think
3553(a),
in
fact...
i
expect
mr.
dreeben
to
say
this...
talks
about
uniformity,
twice,
in
the
sense
that
both
3553(a)(4),
which
requires
consideration
of
the
guidelines,
and
3553(a)(6)
talks
about
unwarranted--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--but
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
consideration...
and
i'm
not
talking
about
a
check
list.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
just
use
a
list
and
that's
enough.
there
has
to...
i
think
sentencing
under
an
advisory
system
requires
reason
and
judgment.
we
tried
to
stress
in
our
brief
that
judgment
is
somehow
different.
it
may
involve
fact-finding
but
is
not
the
determinant,
the
automatic
jury
kind
of
finding
that
the
guidelines
require.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
don't
believe
that,
that
the
results
are
going
to
be
considerable
disparity.
certainly
no
more
disparity
than
existed
under
the
mandatory
guidelines
which
wasn't
being
addressed
particularly.
i
think
indeed
there
may
be
more
non-guideline
sentences,
but
less
true
disparity,
because
it
really
is
kind
of
idle
to
talk
about
disparity
unless
you
are
measuring
it
against
something.
and
3553(a)
provides
those
purposes,
and
true
disparity
is
measured--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
do
remember
those
days.
and
i
think
there
are
two
significant
points
about
that.
one,
judges
sentenced
in
the
pre-sentencing
reform
act,
knowing
that
their
sentence
wasn't
the
real
time
served.
so
that
a
judge
may
say
20
year
sentence
knowing
the
defendant
was
immediately
eligible
for
parole
and
was
going
to
get
out
soon.
the
real
number
was
parole
eligibility
sentencing.
so
that
looking
at
just
the
actual
sentence
imposed
did
not
tell
you
very
much
about
disparity.
and
none...
in
the
study
that
the
sentencing
commission
in
its
amicus
cited...
that
study
explicitly
said
that
none
of
the
studies
looking
at
pre-sentencing
reform
act
interjudge
disparity
considered
actual
sentences
served
as
opposed
to
actual
sentences
imposed.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
don't
believe
that
sentencing
under
an
effectively
advisory
system
under
the
standards
of
appellate
review
that
i've
described,
which
i
think
is
the
standard
booker
described,
is
in
a
sense
an
empty
exercise
on
appeal,
and
leading
simply--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--yes.
mr.
michael
dwyer
that
would...
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
first
look
to
ensure
that
there
was
reasoned
elaboration
of
a
judgment
complying
with
3553(a),
that
the
district
court
considered
all
of
the
factors
and
arrived
at
a
judgment
that
this
sentence
was
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary.
secondly,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
that
deferential
standard
of
review
that
booker
described
would
look
to
see
if
this
is
a
sentence
that
a
reasonable
judge
would
find
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary
on
those
facts.
mr.
michael
dwyer
yes.
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
is
what
will
result
under
an
effectively
advisory
system.
but
here
we're
talking--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
dwyer
well,
i...
i
also
appreciate
the
dialogue.
and--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--and...
and
one
of
the
serious
problems
in
the
solution
that
booker
chose
is
that
while
judicial
discretion,
which
i
think
3553(a)
requires
and
mandates,
and
an
advisory
system
requires,
that,
too,
doesn't
deal
with
the
necessary
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
which
has
an
enormous
thumb
on
the
scale,
and
which
the
district
court,
in
the
day
to
day
work
of
the
criminal
system
in
the
courts,
in
the
district
courts,
has
a
far
greater
appreciation
for,
than
a
court
of
appeals
would.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
think
that
the
judge
in
the
obligation
of
imposing
an
individual
sentence
must
consider
the
advice
of
the
guidelines
but
must
also
be
free
to
shape
and
tailor
that
advice
as
the
circumstances
of
that
case
require.
mr.
michael
dwyer
yes.
mr.
michael
dwyer
yes,
because
i
think
if
the
judge
can
elaborate
reasons
to
justify
that
judgment
in
that
case--
mr.
michael
dwyer
--well,
i
beg
to
differ,
chief
justice
roberts,
because
the
differences
were
predicated
on
assumptions
about
the
type
of
individuals
who
would
engage
in
that.
and
the
court
in
her
experience
could
look
at
it
and
say
you
aren't
the
typical
crack
defendant,
you
are
more
like
the
people
who
come
before
me
who
are
involved
in
powdered
cocaine,
or
you
don't
possess
the
violence,
the
weaponry
and
the
other
things
that
justified
congress's
decision
to
create
disparate
sentences
for
these
two
kinds
of
cocaine.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
don't
think
that
the
district
judge's
role
is
to
make
categorical
pronouncements.
mr.
michael
dwyer
well,
i
would
resolve
the
problem
by
saying
that
the
district
judge
must
consider
the
guidelines.
the
district
judge
doesn't
sit
in
review
of
the
policy.
it
has
to
apply
it
to
a
specific
person.
in
a
particular
case,
as
in
mario
claiborne's,
that
policy
produced
a
sentence
that
would
have
been
too
great.
and
the
application
had
some
numbers
to
it,
so
she
said
it
was
more
serious
because
it
was
a
crack
cocaine
case,
you're
going
to
get
more
than
somebody
who
was
involved
with
powder
would
get,
but
you
don't
need
to
get
as
much
as
the
guidelines
call
for,
for
the
reasons
that
she
expressed
on
the
record
at
the
sentencing.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
unless
there
are
other
questions?
mr.
michael
dwyer
i
believe
that
justice
breyer
put
his
finger
on
one
of
the
central
problems
with
the
government's
proposed
rule.
and
that
is
what
does
it
mean?
the
government
talks
about
substantial
variances
in
petitioner's
case.
the
court
of
appeals
spoke
of
it
as
extraordinary
variances.
and
the
government
doesn't
suggest
to
us
that
substantial
means
the
same
thing
or
means
something
different
from
extraordinary.
and
we've
already
demonstrated
in
our
brief
why
relying
on
percentages
as
the
court
of
appeals
also
did,
is
pointless,
because,
one,
if...
the
arithmetic
gets
very
complicated
at
the
low
end
and
the
percentages
just
don't
make
any
sense
from
a
proper
application
of
a
rule
of
law.
the
government's
proposal,
apart
from
having
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
no
basis
in
booker,
is
just
not
susceptible
of
any
kind
of
application
because
nobody
really
knows
what
it
means.
mr.
michael
dwyer
i'm
certainly
going
to
argue
that
under
the
facts
and
the
record
before
the
court,
that
was
not
a
sentence
that
was
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary.
and
i
think
the
absence
of
a
prior
record,
the
young
man's
work
history,
all
of
those
factors,
the
low
amount
of
crack
cocaine
involved,
his
age,
all
of
the
things
which
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
that
judge
relied
on
in
her
sentencing
decision,
could
not
possibly
support
a
10-year
sentence.
and
you
know,
it
is
easy
to
do
this
in
a,
in
a
hypothetical
sort
of
way.
but
the
district
judge...
and
this
was
a
very
experienced
district
judge...
looking
at
the
person
in
the
eye,
made
a
call
based
on
judgment.
and
that
call
was
not
treated
with
any
respect
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
sloganeered
away
as
an
extraordinary
variance.
and...
because
the
court
of
appeals
focused
only
on
the
guidelines.
the...
this
court
in
crafting
the
appellate
standard
can't
just
look
to
determine
what
congress
might
have
intended
because
of
the
constitutional
problem
that
lurks
behind
it.
and
that
constitutional
problem
is
a
resumption
of
mandatory
guidelines.
thank
you
very
much.
