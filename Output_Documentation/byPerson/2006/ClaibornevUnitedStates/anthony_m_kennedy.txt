justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
gives
very
little
weight
to
the
goal,
which
i
think
is
a
congressional
goal,
of
nationwide
consistency
in
eliminating
the
disparities
in
the
sentencing
system
which
cause
great
disrespect
to
the
justice
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i
substitute
"substantial"
for
"gravitational"
without
offending
your
position
or
affecting
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
kind
of
a
weak
law
of
gravity
like
the
moon.
it's
only
at
one-seventh.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
the
question
is
how
strong
should
we
say
or
can
we
say,
or
can
congress
say
it
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it
seems
to
me
that
to
accomplish
the
goal
that
you
want
to
accomplish
in
this
case,
you
almost
remove
the
appellate
courts
from
the
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
one
of
the
themes
that
you
advance,
you
indicate
that
if
your
approach
is
followed
that
the
guidelines
will
then
be
adjusted
over
time.
i
assume
they
would
be
adjusted
to
be
more
precise,
but
then
we
are
right
back
where
we
started
because
you
want
to
give
the
guidelines
very
little
effect.
it
seems
to
me,
in
a
way,
you're
arguing
against
yourself.
if
your
view
is
accepted
and
the
result
is
considerable
disparity,
i
suppose
all
that
congress
can
do
is
have
mandatory
minimums.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it
is
idle
to
talk
about
disparity
before
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
adopted?
you
remember
those
days.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you
ran
away
from
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
just
a
little
bit.
let's
assume
that
congress
wants
to
keep
this
distinction
and
let's
assume
that
there's
no
constitutional
problem
with
the
distinction.
there
might
be,
but
let's
assume.
can
the
judge
simply
say,
i
ignore
that
congressional...
congressional
judgment
is
wrong.
i'm
not
going
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
judge
permitted--
