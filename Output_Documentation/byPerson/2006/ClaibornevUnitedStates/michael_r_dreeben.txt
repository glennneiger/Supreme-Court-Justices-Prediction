mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
booker
concluded
that
the
remedial
severing
of
the
statute's
provision
for
mandatory
application
of
the
guidelines
and
a
provision
governing
the
standards
of
review
on
appeal
rendered
the
statute
constitutional.
it
further
implied
a
standard
of
review
of
reasonableness
of
guideline
sentences
on
appeal,
and
it
did
not
elaborate
what
that
reasonableness
requirement
means.
the
government
submits
that
the
best
interpretation
of
a
reasonableness
form
of
review
would
be
one
that
conforms
as
closely
as
it
can
to
congress's
original
intent
of
minimizing
and
eliminating
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
between
similarly
situated
defendants.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
as
i
think
we
talked
about
in
the
last
argument,
in
theory
it
could
be
if
this
court
concludes
that
judicial
determinations
on
appeal
are
equivalent
to
guidelines
promulgated
by
a
commission
or
statute,
and
if
what
the
court
of
appeals
does
is
essentially
function
as
a
sentencing
commission,
literally
prescribing
particular
levels
of
punishment
for
recurring
sets
of
facts.
the
government's
submission
here
is
not
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
do
that
in
order
to
apply
a
proportionality
principle.
a
proportionality
principle
will
look
to
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
will
try
to
get
a
handle
on,
is
this
a
reasonable
sentence
in
response
to
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
the
judge
articulated
within--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
he
doesn't,
justice
scalia,
because
the
second
defendant
may
not
encounter
a
judge
who
concludes
that
that
quantity
warrants
the
same
level
of
leniency
or
any
leniency
at
all.
that
judge
will
retain
the
judge's
classic
discretion
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
facts
and
conclude
whether
a
sentence
that
would
be
below
the
range
is
a
reasonable
sentence.
and
unlike
a
situation
that
some
of
us
might
prefer
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
would
ensure
that
like
cases
are
treated
with
reasonable
consistency,
the
system
of
reasonableness
review
on
top
of
advisory
guidelines
will
not
produce
perfect
levels
of
consistency.
and
what
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
under
the
sixth
amendment
rulings
of
this
court
is
knowing
that
if
the
law
says
if
i
commit
this
crime
and
these
are
the
facts
that
support
it,
my
level
of
sentence
is
this
and
no
higher,
that
any
higher
sentence
that's
produced
by
a
fact
finding
gives
him
a
jury
trial
entitlement.
that's
what
the
sixth
amendment
entitles
you.
but
no
defendant
who
commits
a
crack
offense
can
say
that
even
after
a
series
of
court
of
appeals
rulings
that
mark
out
various
points
of
reasonableness.
that
defendant
will
not
know
whether
the
judge
that
he
or
she
appears
in
front
of
will
give
the
same
kind
of
weight
to
those
facts
as
some
other
judge
did
who
was
affirmed
or
reversed.
nor
will
that
judge
be
able
to
say
what
is
the
constellation
of
policy
and
factual
reasons
that
this
particular
judge
will
find
in
announcing
the
judge's
sentence.
so
i
don't
think
that
a
proportionality
principle
runs
afoul
of
the
sixth
amendment.
and
i
don't
think
that
it
runs
afoul
of
anything
in
3553(a)
or
any
other
part
of
the
statute.
what
the
court
is
left
with
is
the
task
of
interpreting
reasonableness,
and
i
submit
it
should
ask
the
same
question
that
it
asked
in
booker
itself:
which
alternative,
the
petitioner's
alternative
in
this
case
or
the
government's,
conforms
more
closely
to
congress's
original
claim
in
the
sentencing
reform
act?
the
petitioner's
version
of
appellate
review
as
i
understand
it
is
very
light
review,
if
at
all,
of
the
substance
of
what
the
district
judge
does.
it
may
reach
a
truly
extreme
case
such
as
if
a
judge
said
a
second
degree
murderer,
i
think
probation
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
perhaps
the
petitioner
would
concede
that
that
would
be
arbitrary
and
irrational;
but
beyond
such
an
extreme
case
that
it
is
so
unlikely
to
arise
that
petitioner
can
feel
free
to
give
it
away,
petitioner
gives
the
court
nothing,
and
gives
the
courts
of
appeals
nothing
to
apply
standards
to
determine
whether
a
particular
sentence
is
reasonable.
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
have
been
reaching
for
when
eight
of
them
have
adopted
this
proportionality
principle.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
at
a
high
level
of
generality,
that
is
true.
because
what
the
sentencing
commission
is
good
at
is
taking
paradigmatic
circumstances
and
assigning
them
a
numerical
weight
that
will
translate
into
a
sentence.
and
what
the
strength
of
the
district
judge
is
is
looking
at
the
defendant
in
front
of
that
particular
judge
and
seeing
how
that
person's
characteristics
may
map
onto
the
policies
of
sentencing.
but
i
don't
agree
that
that
distinction
would
support
a
two-track
form
of
appellate
review
that
would
give
the
district
judge
greater
deference
to
take
personal
characteristics
into
account
and
to
impose
widely
varying
sentences.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
we
had
in
the
pre
sentencing
reform
act
era
when
any
district
judge
could
choose
whatever
policies
of
sentencing
appeal
to
that
judge,
find
the
facts,
and
impose
a
widely
disparate
sentence.
and
as
the
court
well
knows,
there
was
no
appellate
review
of
that
exercise
of
discretion
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
the
judge
didn't
exercise
discretion
at
all.
now
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
discretion
if
a
judge
simply
says
for
this
crime,
i
always
give
the
same
sentence.
that
would
not
take
into
account
the
full
range
of
facts
and
factors
that
are
present
in
the
sentencing
court
and
as
a
result,
that
wouldn't
be
an
exercise
of
discretion.
but
in
the
pre
sentencing
reform
act
era,
the
judge
had
pretty
much
plenary
reign
to
decide
what
facts
mattered.
if
we
continue
with
that
same
sort
of
deference
on
appeal
in
the
booker
remedial
opinion,
then
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
appellate
review
can
serve
any
valid
purpose
of
channeling
and
ensuring
some
consistency
and
uniformity
in
the
way
district
judges
impose
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
if
the
system
that
you're
describing
is
a
replica
of
the
system
that
existed
under
koon
versus
united
states--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--then
it
runs
into
the
same
problem
that
led
to
the
constitutional
problem
in
booker.
where
i
think
i
would
amend
your
honor's
proposal
is
that
if
the
judge
concludes
that
this
is
a
typical
case
but
the
guideline
really
doesn't
prescribe
what
i
think
is
a
reasonable
sentence
and
here
are
the
reasons
why,
in
the
pre-sentencing...
in
the
pre-booker
system,
that
could
have
been
problematic
legally.
today,
it
is
not
forbidden.
but
what
it
should
be
subject
to
is
a
reasonableness
review
check
on
appeal
that
take
a
look
at
what
are
the
reasons
that
the
district
judge
articulated
for
that
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do
think,
though,
that
the
court
should
be
concerned
about
each
district
judge
formulating
his
or
her
own
set
of
personal
sentencing
guidelines
and
then
applying
them
in
the
court
to
the
cases
that
appear
on
that
judge's
docket
without
any
check
on
appellate
review
to
ensure
that,
although
the
sentence
might
be
in
some
possible
world
reasonable,
it's
out
of
whack
with
what
the
sentencing
commission
has
prescribed
and
what
other
district
judges
are
doing.
if
there
is
no
check
on
appeal,
then
i
do
think
that
the
clock
has
been
turned
back
to
the
1983
era
before
the
sentencing
reform
act;
and
that
does
not
seem
to
me
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
booker
remedial
opinion
thought
it
was
accomplishing.
what
the
booker
remedial
opinion
said
that
it
was
accomplishing
was
providing
an
important
mechanism
that
congress
itself
had
intended,
namely
appellate
review,
in
order
to
iron
out
sentencing
differences.
and
our
submission
is
that
inherently
means
some
form
of
substantive
proportionality
review.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
what
is
proportional
is
a
matter
of
common
sense,
and
the
eight
circuits
that
have
been
using
this
rule
have
not
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
noting
that
you
look
at
the
extent
to
which
the
sentence
varies
from
the
guidelines
range,
you
look
at
the
absolute
amount
of
time
that's
involved,
and
have
a
sense
of
is
this
a
significant
deviation
away
from
what
the
guidelines
would
actually
describe.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
sentencing
court
articulates
a
bad
reason,
namely
a
reason
that's
irrational
or
one
that
does
not
respond
to
facts
of
the
case,
then
that
really
shouldn't
justify
the
sentence
at
all
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
do
is
vacate
it,
send
it
back
for
resentencing,
and
allow
the
district
court
to
articulate
the
reasons
why
the
sentence
that
the
court
now
chooses
to
impose
is
an
appropriate
sentence
under
3553(a).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
you've
done
a
better
job
of
articulating
a
justification
for
the
sentence
than
the
judge's
own
articulation,
which
did
not
focus
on
family
separation
and
employment
to
the
degree
that
you
have
now
articulated
it.
what
the
judge
did
was
focus
on
the
quantity
of
drugs
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
have
any
criminal
history
and
that
he
qualified
for
the
safety
valve.
she
also
said,
without
specifying
any
other
cases,
that
other
cases
that
have
come
before
my
court
have
had...
you
know...
perhaps
larger
quantity
of
drugs
and
very
different
sentences.
when
a
court
of
appeals
is
asked
to
review
that
line
of
reasoning
and
try
to
decide
whether
the
outside
the
guidelines
sentence
is
reasonable,
it
makes
sense
for
the
court
to
ask,
do
we
know
anything,
for
example,
about
what
this
judge
is
saying
about
other
cases
with
other
drug
quantities?
there's
no
specifics
in
the
record
that
enable
the
court
of
appeals
to
measure
the
accuracy
or
the
validity
of
that
observation.
it's
also
relevant
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
the
guidelines
range
itself
has
taken
into
account
all
of
the
factors
that
this
judge
has
previously
noted
and
what
has
happened
in
the
sentence
is
that
the
judge
has
varied
widely
from
the
sentence
for
reasons
that
the
commission
already
took
into
account.
now,
that
doesn't
prohibit
the
judge
from
relying
on
those
facts,
but
it
does
mean
that
the
farther
the
sentence
goes
from
the
guidelines
range
the
more
likely
there
is
to
be
unwarranted
disparity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
brings
me
to
my
last
point
about
this
particular
sentencing,
which
is
that
in
this
very
case
judge
jackson
looked
at
the
defendant.
she
said,
candidly
i
don't
know
really
very
much
about
you
other
than
what
i've
learned
about
in
the
presentence
report
and
i
can't
tell
whether
you're
unlucky
or
you're
stupid,
and
then
effectively
gave
him
a
sentence
that
reflected,
you
know,
a
tremendous
indulgence
of
a
presumption
that
maybe
this
kid
needs
a
wakeup
call
and
nothing
more.
what
she
ignored
is
his
own
proffer
in
the
safety
valve
that
he
had
been
on
a
street
corner
for
2-1/2
months
selling
crack
cocaine,
that
he
was
arrested
and
placed
into
the
state
system,
put
into
a
pretrial
diversion
program
through
a
drug
court,
in
essence
being
said,
here's
your
chance,
you
know,
straighten
up,
we
are
going
to
be
lenient
on
you,
we're
going
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
reintegrate
with
your
family,
and
what
did
the
defendant
do
but
get
caught
within
6
months
with
5
grams
of
crack.
and
on
that
record...
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said...
there's
a
disconnect
between
the
judge's
conclusion
that,
with
little
information
more
than
what
she
had
in
the
psr,
the
kid
deserved
leniency
versus
the
fact
that
he
had
already
had
that
chance
and
he
had
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
stevens,
we're
not
relying
on
the
inference
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
supported
by
the
record
is
something
of
a
judgment
call.
you'd
have
to
assume
that
mr.
claiborne
was
found
by
the
police,
6
months
after
he
had
previously
been
arrested
for
crack
offenses,
holding
a
5-gram
bag
of
crack
and
that
was
the
very
first
time
after
his
arrest
that
he
had
been
in
possession
of
drugs,
that
just
he
got
extremely
unlucky,
the
police
caught
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
i
would
say
that
a
reasonable
fact-finder
could
draw
that
conclusion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
in
my
view.
and
i
think
on
this
record
that's
not
a
fact
that
we're
relying
on.
it's
not
a
fact
that
the
government--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
aspect
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
my
view
is
not
essential
to
the
judgment
that
it
reached,
which
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
may
have,
but
what
they
did
not
mention
is
an
equally
valid
reason
for
concluding
that
this
is
a
defendant
who
is
in
effect
a
recidivist
even
though
he
had
no
criminal
history.
he
had
been
previously
arrested
for
crack
distribution
crimes.
he
had
admitted
that
this
was
not...
the
occasion
of
his
arrest
wasn't
the
first
opportunity
that
he
had
to
deal
crack.
he'd
been
doing
it
for
2-1/2
months.
and
the
judge
essentially
turned
all
of
those
facts
off.
she
did
not
really
factor
that
into
her
sentence
at
all.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
although
it
may
have
fastened
on
the
wrong
time
frame
in
concluding
that
this
defendant
was
in
effect
a
recidivist
and
not
the
sort
of
blameless
ingenue
that
the
trial
judge
had
treated
him
as,
the
record
does
indeed
support
the
court
of
appeals'
central
conclusion,
which
is
this
defendant,
despite
his
criminal
history,
really
looks
more
like
a
recidivist.
and
when
you're
talking
about
a
defendant
whose
mandatory
minimum
sentence
would
have
been
5
years,
but
who
gets
out
of
that
sentence
because
he
satisfies
the
safety
valve
which
allows
defendant
who
is
a
first-time
offender
and
meets
certain
other
requirements
to
get
a
sentence
under
the
mandatory
minimum,
that
defendant's
culpability
had
already
been
substantially
reduced
under
the
guidelines
because
of
the
safety
valve
and
because
of
his
criminal
history.
and
the
judge
basically
said:
i'm
going
to
take
a
chance
with
him
and
give
him
a
much
lower
sentence
than
what
the
guidelines
described.
our
view
is
the
judge
can
look
at
the
facts
she
looked
at,
but
she
went
down
to
a
level
that
is
productive
of
unwarranted
disparity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
we're
not
arguing
for
a
presumption
of
unreasonableness
on
appeal.
we're
arguing
for
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
for
a
guidelines
sentence.
for
an
out
of
guidelines
sentence
there
is
no
presumption
that
it
is
unreasonable,
but
the
court
of
appeals
under
a
proportionality
analysis
would
look
and
require
increasingly
strong
reasons
with
the
increasing
degree
of
variance
from--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
you
want
a
better
reason
for
a
sentence
that
is
farther
away
from
some
mean.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
perhaps
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
to
give
a
example.
suppose
that
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot.
suppose
that
judge
jackson
had
looked
at
this
defendant
and
said,
you
know,
this
defendant
did
not
learn
from
his
experience.
he
was
given
leniency
in
the
state
court.
he
didn't
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity.
his
statutory
maximum
is
20
years
and
i'm
going
to
give
him,
maybe
not
the
statutory
maximum,
i'm
going
to
give
him
an
18-year
sentence,
or
suppose
she
said
a
15-year
sentence
or
a
10-year
sentence.
i
submit
that
in
that
circumstances
the
petitioner
would
be
here
saying,
well,
the
guidelines
recommended
a
sentence
of
between
37
and
46
months
and
this
is
a
dramatic
increase
from
that
and
the
reason
is
not
something
that's
particularly
unusual,
it's
a
very
usual
reason,
and
as
a
result,
the
magnitude
of
this
deviation
is
unreasonable.
and
i
have
no
problem
with
a
petitioner
making
that
argument
if
that's
what
happens
to
his
or
her
client.
my
problem
is
that
without
that
kind
of
anchoring
effect
of
the
guidelines
in
a
proportionality
review,
a
court
of
appeals
has
almost
nothing
to
work
with.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are,
at
least
absent
very
unusual
circumstances,
to
act
as
sentencers
to
specify
a
sentence.
there
have
been
a
couple
of
instances
where
courts
of
appeals
have
said
this
is
really
the
bottom
sentence
that
we
can
see
that
would
be
reasonable
on
this
particular
constellation
of
facts.
i
think
that
reflect
as
sense
of
potential
impatience
with
a
ping-pong
game
that
would
occur
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
your
sentence
is
unreasonable,
mr.
district
judge,
and
the
district
judge
imposes
a
sentence
that's
one
day
lower.
another
solution
to
that
problem
would
be
reassignment
to
a
different
judge
who
would
start
with
a
clean
slate
and
could
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
apply
the
section
3553
factors.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
assume
the
sentencing
role
here.
all
we're
suggesting
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
needs
to
have
some
intelligible
legal
principles
that
allow
it
to
identify
and
select
unreasonable
sentences
versus
reasonable
sentences;
and
when
you
have
wide
statutory
ranges
as
you
do
in
the
federal
system,
if
you
don't
have
the
guidelines
describing
at
least
a
benchmark,
it's
not
more,
then
i
don't
think
courts
of
appeals
have
a
good,
coherent,
consistent
way
of
fulfilling
their
tasks.
and
if
the
courts
of
appeals
can
do
that,
can
look
more
with
greater
scrutiny
at
a
sentence
the
farther
that
it
goes
outside
the
guidelines
range,
without
violating
the
statute
and
without
violating
the
constitution,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
for
the
court
to
ask
at
that
point
is
which
approach,
that
approach
of
proportionality,
or
and
approach
that
basically
says
appellate
review
is
procedural
only,
absent
the
most
glaringly
aberrant
sentences,
conforms
to
congress's
intent
of
producing
a
greater
degree
of
uniformity
and
consistency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
that
is
true.
but
i
submit
that...
i
would
like
to
hear
what
petitioner
has
to
say.
if
petitioner's
client
had
been
given
10
years
in
this
case,
i
have
no
doubt
that
petitioner
would
be
arguing
that's
an
unreasonable
sentence.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
reach
that
judgment
assuming
that
the
court
has
articulated
a
rationale
that's
consistent
with
section
3553
and
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
facts,
unless
you
have
the
guidelines
as
an
anchor
for
the
analysis.
thank
you.
