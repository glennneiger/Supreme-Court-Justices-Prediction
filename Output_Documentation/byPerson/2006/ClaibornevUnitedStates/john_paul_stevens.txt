justice
john
paul
stevens
to
what
extent
is
the
congress's
purpose
later
than
the
congress
that
enacted
the
statute
we're
construing?
the
statute
we're
construing
was
enacted
by
one
congress
and
these
expressions
came
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
it
seems
to
me
that
in
sentencing
there
are
two
different
broad
categories
of
decision
that
the
judge
has
to
make,
one
involving
the
severity
of
the
crime,
and
the
other
the
characteristics
of
the
particular
offender.
and
might
it
not
be
the
case
that
you
give
a
greater
presumption
of
following
the
guidelines
when
you're
talking
about
the
severity
of
the
offense,
and
a
greater
deference
to
the
trial
judge
when
you're
evaluating
the
factors
of
the
individual
that
might
affect
the
sentence?
there
might
be
a
difference
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
draw
the
inference
that
he
had
been
distributing
drugs
during
that
6-month
period
and
that
was
not
supported
by
the
record?
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
been
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
find
a
fact
like
that
that
was
not
supported
by
the
record
and
didn't
it
do
it
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
willing
to
draw
a
factual
conclusion
that
he
had
in
fact
distributed
during
that
6-month
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
should
the
court
of
appeals
act
as
a
fact-finder
in
that
posture
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
possibly
a
fact
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
they
committed
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
not
have
been
essential,
but
it
may
have
contributed
to
their
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
i
do
not
understand
you
to
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
apply
a
presumption
of
unreasonableness
just
because
there's
a
departure.
