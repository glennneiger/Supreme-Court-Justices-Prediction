justice
antonin
scalia
in
any
case,
you...
you,
you
are
not
driven
to
the
alternative
that
justice
breyer
suggests,
that
there
is
no
way
to
achieve
absolute
uniformity.
it's
very
easy.
it
was
what
the
dissenters
in
the
booker
remedial
phase
urged,
which
is
use
facts
found
by
the
jury
and
you
can
have
the
sentences
as
rigid
as
you
like.
it
is
really
only,
only
when
you
want
to
let
the
facts
be
found
by
the
judge
that
you
come
into
the
difficulty
that,
that
we're
arguing
about.
but
it's
certainly
not
decreed
by
logic
or
by
heaven
that
there
is
no
way
to
achieve
determinate
sentencing.
there
certainly
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
engage
in
our
dispute
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
as
closely
as
it
can,
and
the
"as
it
can"
depends
upon
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
by
entitling
defendants
to
sentences
determined
by
facts
found
by
a
judge
instead
of
a
jury.
suppose
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
disallowing
the
lower
sentence,
approved
it?
and
then
in
the
next
case
that
comes
up
involving
what
was
the
small
amount
of
equivalent,
5.26
grams
of
cocaine
powder
rather
than
crack,
okay?
suppose
in
the
next
case
it
would
have
been
30
grams
of
powder.
and
the
district
court
judge
once
again
departs
just
the
way
the
departure
was
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
no,
that
departure
is
unreasonable.
you
now
have
circuit
law
which
says
30
grams,
you
get
the
guidelines
sentence;
5.26
grams,
you're
entitled
to
a
lesser
sentence.
okay?
why
isn't...
why
haven't
we
fallen
back
into
the
same
problem
that
produced
booker/fanfan?
you
have
fact
findings
being
made
by
the
judge.
it's
a
judge
who
decides
whether
it's
30
grams
or
5.26
grams.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
that
factual
difference
produces
an
entitlement
to
a
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
guidelines
or
on
the
basis
of
an
opinion
by
or
a
series
of
opinion
by
a
court
of
appeals?
isn't
the
sixth
amendment
equally
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
have
two
cases
that
are
in
other
respects
similar,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
5.26
is
too
little
to
apply
the
guidelines,
it's
okay
to
depart
downward
the
way
this
judge
did,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
next
case
that
comes
up,
the
defendant
has
an
entitlement
to
that
lower
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
why
do
we
assume
that
the
district
judge
cannot
depart
from
the
guideline
recommendation
unless
he
thinks
the
guideline
recommendation
is
unreasonable?
he
doesn't...
does
he
have
to
find
it's
unreasonable?
there
can
certainly
be
two
reasonable
sentences;
and
he's
under
no
obligation
to
select
the
guidelines
sentence,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
doesn't
have
to
determine
that
it's
unreasonable.
i
don't
think
we
should
approach
the
discussion
as
though
that's,
that's
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
happens
when
that
case...
it
goes
back
down
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
says
well,
okay,
not
10
years.
nine
years.
okay?
it
goes
back
up.
i
mean,
you
know,
when
do
we
end
this
game?
or
does
the
court
of
appeals
take
over
the
sentencing
function
and
specify...
you
know,
five
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wouldn't
be,
just
be
procedural
only.
you...
you
could
say
procedural
plus,
you
know,
certainly
review
of
the
facts
on,
on
which
the
district
court
was...
was
proceeding.
so
you,
if
you
could
find
that
the
determination
that
this
was
just
a
good
kid
who
made
a
mistake
is,
is
an
unreasonable
finding,
you
could
reverse
for
that
reason.
