what
would
be
your
test
of
reasonableness
for
appellate
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
describe
it
again?
because
i'm
not
clear
what
your
answer
was
to
what
the
appellate
court
stance
is.
i
take
it
the
appellate
court
would
owe
deference
to
the
district
court's
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
no
particular
deference
to
the
guidelines?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is
it
other
than...
is
this
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
one
problem
is
that
two
judges,
both
reasonable,
might
approach
the
facts
in
this
very
case
differently.
that
is,
one
as
in
this
case
might
think
as
she
expressed
it,
to
sentence
him
to
more
than
15
months
would
throw
away
his
life.
another
might
say
it's...
it's
unreal
to
assume
that
he
just
sold
23
grams
of
crack
when
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
out
on
that
same
street
every
night
for
two
and
a
half
weeks.
so
the
quantity
is
much
larger.
and
he
was
in
that
sense
a
repeater,
so
i'm
going
to
sentence
him
to
at
least
the
bottom
of
the
guidelines,
nothing
less.
those
could
be
reasonable
determinations,
two
different
reactions
that
judges
would
have
to
the
same
set
of
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dwyer,
before
we
get
to
the
prosecutor,
you
were
candid
in
saying
a
district
court...
different
district
judges
could
act
reasonably,
one
of
them
giving
whatever
it
was,
33
months,
and
the
other
giving
15
months,
both
of
those
would
be
reasonable
and
could
be
affirmed
on
appeal.
but
one
of,
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
by
defense
counsel
here
was
just
there
was...
there
is
an
irrational
disparity
between
the
penalty
for
crack
and
the
penalty
for
powdered
cocaine.
your
predecessor
thought
that
was
so
wrong,
he
thought
it
was
unconstitutional.
i
think
at
the
very
least
you
ought
to
take
into
account
that
if
this
man
were
distributing
or
possessed
for
distribution
powdered
cocaine
instead
of
crack,
the
sentence
range,
the
guideline
sentence
range
would
have
been
six
months
to
a
year.
now
we
know
that
congress
wanted
to
retain
that
disparity.
is
a
district
judge
free
to
say
under
advisory
guidelines,
i
am
going
to
ignore
the
difference,
i'm
going
to
treat
this
defendant
as
though
he
possessed
powdered
cocaine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
specifically,
can
you
take
into
account,
can
he
say
i'm
going
to
treat
him
as
though
he
possessed
powdered
cocaine?
can
he
do
that?
yes
or
no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
we
know
that
congress
didn't
want
that
to
happen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
if
we
could
focus
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
what
the
district
court
appeared
to
do,
she
made
a
kind
of
proportionality
judgment,
too.
she
said
this
is
a
young
man.
it's
his
first
offense.
he
has
a
good
family
relationship,
a
good
work
record.
i
am
making
a
determination
that
will
put
him
away
for
a
significant
amount
of
time.
but
i'm
trying
to
figure
the
point
at
which
he
will
lose
touch
with
his
family,
with
his
work,
he
will
be
thrown
away.
that
was
the
judgment
that
she
made.
she
tried
to
make
a
sentence
that
would
be
significant,
15
months,
but
that
would
not
be
so
long
that
it
would
put
him
out
of
touch
with
his
children
and
his
wife
and
his
work.
now,
in...
by
some
measures
that
would
be
entirely
reasonable.
but
on
your
measure,
it
isn't
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
leave
out
what...
she
didn't
elaborate
on
it,
but
she
said,
i
would
be
throwing
him
away.
and
i
take
it
what
she
was
saying
by
that
is
it
would
be...
he
would
be
incarcerated
beyond
the
point
where
he
could
reintegrate
into
the
community.
