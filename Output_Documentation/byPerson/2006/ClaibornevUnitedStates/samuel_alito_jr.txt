alito,

well,
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
exactly
what
it
did
in
this
case,
but
it
said,
we're
not
giving
any
special
weight
whatsoever
to
the
guidelines,
we're
basing
this
just
on
our
own
evaluation
of
the
sentencing
factors
that
are
set
out
in
the
sentencing
reform
act.
would
there
be
a
problem
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
a
principle
that
you
derive
from
what?
from
the
sixth
amendment?
from
the
sentencing
reform
act?
from
where?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
sentencing
reform
act
required,
as
enacted
by
congress,
required
trial
judges
to
apply
the
guidelines,
to
follow
the
guidelines.
and
you're
saying
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
now
precludes
appellate
review
of...
it
gives
the
trial
judges
unlimited
discretion
or
extremely
broad
discretion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute
that
was
enacted
to
narrow
their
discretion?
