justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
that
come
from
as
a
matter
of
law?
that
is,
suppose...
now
you
can
say
i...
if
you
want,
say
my
hypothesis
is
wrong,
but
if
i
start
with
an
assumption
that
congress
did
want
the
court
of
appeals
to
try
to
create
greater
uniformity
in
sentencing,
and
it
wanted
cooperation
between
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
sentencing
commission,
indeed
the
sentencing
commission
itself
is
an
effort
to
copy
a
system
that
exists
in
britain
where
courts
of
appeals
create
a
degree
of
uniformity.
suppose
i
start
with
that
assumption
and
say
that's
what
the
guidelines
were
about
and
the
reason
that
number
4
is
in
3553,
it's
not
just
one
factor
among
many.
after
all,
it
was
attached
to
a
bill
that
was
the
guideline
bill.
and
indeed,
the
part
we
excised
was
a
floor
amendment
that
came
along
later
to
make
it
even
tougher.
so
if
i
start
with
the
assumption
that's
what
congress
wanted,
not
what
i
wanted,
congress
wanted
it,
now
is
there
something
in
the
constitution
that
forbids
it?
that's
where
i
start...
i
am
starting
personally
with
that
question
in
mind,
always,
if
this
is
what
congress
wanted,
we
should
try
to
do
it
unless
there's
something
in
the
constitution
that
forbids
it.
and
is
there
something
in
the
constitution
that
would
forbid
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
what
on
page
91
they
did
here,
leaving
the
word
extraordinary
out
of
it?
now,
just
going
through
the
different
elements
of
this
case
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
what
the
district
judge
did
was
unreasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
mandatory.
it
says
the
district,
the
court
of
appeals
judge
says,
now,
let's
think
here.
we
have
8...
7
people
on
the
sentencing
commission
that
have
really
looked
into
that.
and
they
think
that
in
an
ordinary
course
with
this
small
amount
of
drugs,
the
person
ought
to
get
so
many
months.
that
reflects
a
lot
of
thought.
seems
reasonable
to
us.
and
here
the
district
judge
is
giving
him
half
that
or
40
percent
of
that
without
a
good
reason
that
we
can
find.
the
judge
said
he
did
it
because
it
was
just
one
little
episode
and
we
think
there
were
many
episodes.
and
that's
basically
their
reason.
now,
now...
what...
the
sixth
amendment
forbids
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
yeah.
but
there...
you
know,
we
can
go
back
into
that,
but
there
was
a
whole
history
that
people
testified,
tremendously,
no
opposition,
virtually
none,
that
you
needed
a
judge
wheel.
why
do
you
need
a
judge
wheel
in
new
york
if,
in
fact,
the
sentence
didn't
depend
on
the
personality
of
the
judge?
and
why
did
you
get
different
sentences
across
the
country
which
i
don't...
i've
never
heard
a
possibility
of
explaining
that
the
judges
didn't
understand
what
the
parole
commission
was
like.
that's
a
different
issue.
so
what...
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
if
we
followed
your
position
literally,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prevents
any
effort
to
create
uniform
sentences
throughout
the
country
for
people
who
different
judges...
god
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
right
sentence
is.
we
don't
know.
there
are
reasonable
sentences
within
a
vast,
vast
range
of
possible
sentences.
and
you're
saying
we
have
to
go
back
to
that.
and
that
wasn't...
i'm
looking,
in
other
words,
for
you
to
tell
me
something
that
says
we
don't
have
to
be
back
to
that,
but
we
don't
have
to
make
it
that
rigid
either.
and
that's
what
i'm
looking
for,
to
be
honest
with
you,
and
i
haven't...
i'm
not
certain
i
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
agree?
because
i
think
that
system
would,
in
fact,
give
total
sentencing
power
to
the
prosecutor,
who
would
determine
the
sentence
by
the
kind
and
degree
of
evidence
that
he
introduced
and
what
he
charged.
so
i
agree
that
that
might
produce
some
kind
of
judicial
uniformity,
but
only
because
the
prosecutor
would
have
total
power
to
decide
what
the
sentence
will
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
pointing
out
there
are
problems
to
every
solution.
and
that's
why
i'm
still
looking
for
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
taking
some
of
the
rivera
ideas...
i'm
slightly
hypothesizing
this...
and
following
up
with
what
justice
stevens
said.
you'd
say
look,
one
thing
a
district
judge
can't
say,
he
can't
say
that
i
believe
the
guideline
is
right
for
a
typical
case.
and
i
think
this
is
a
typical
case.
and
i
won't
follow
the
guideline.
you
couldn't
think
those
three
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
one
big
power
a
judge
has
that
they
didn't
have
before,
after
booker,
is
to
say
the
guideline
itself
is
unreasonable.
so
we're...
let's
just
say...
and
there
if
they
say
that,
the
district
judge
could
decide
whether
or
not,
the
court
of
appeals
could
decide
is
the
guideline
reasonable
or
not
reasonable.
but
leave
those
cases
aside.
i
imagine
they'll
be
few
and
far
between.
now
we
take
one
they
assume
is
reasonable.
and
now
unlike
the
past,
the
judge
has
to
do
three
things.
one,
to
give
the
kind
of
thing
that...
the
reason
he's
not
following
the
guideline,
which
he
admits
is
reasonable
for
a
typical
case.
so
what's
the
kind
of
thing
that
leads
you
to
think
yours
is
not
typical?
and
he
says
it.
and
then
he
has
the
evidence
as
to
the
related
facts.
and
then
he
has
the
degree
of
departure.
as
to
the
first
thing,
the
court
of
appeals
could
review
it
and
decide
whether
it
is
or
is
not
the
kind
of
thing.
as
to
the
second
and
third,
they
also
could
review
it
but
only
after
giving
considerable
weight
to
what
the
district
judge
thinks
about
the
case
in
front
of
him.
now
maybe
that's...
i
mean,
you
might
not
have
a
reaction
to
that.
i'd
have
to
sort
of
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
quite--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
other
thing
i'm
not
certain
about,
the
proportionality,
and
the
reason
i'm
not
certain
of
it
is
i'm
not
certain
what
it
means.
that
is,
it
sounds
nice,
as
if
you're
saying
something,
but
proportional
to
what?
i
mean,
i
can
think
of
two
problems.
one
problem,
of
course,
is
that
the
chart
in
the
guidelines
is
written
on
a
logarithmic
scale
and
that
means
that
if
you
move
from
one
level,
from
9
to
10,
it's
3
months
or
2
months;
if
you
move
from
29
to
30,
it's
2
years.
now,
whether
you're
at
29-30
or
whether
you're
at
9
and
10
might
depend
upon
things
that
just
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
reason
for
departure.
you
might
have
added
on
something
for
having
a
gun
and
your
reason
for
being
lenient
might
have
to
do
with
the
person's
having
a
gun.
so
you're
going
to
say
it
make
a
difference
whether
you
were
high
up
or
whether
you
were
low
down,
when
your
reason
for
departing
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you're
high
up
or
whether
you
were
low
down?
you
see?
it
doesn't
actually
work,
i
don't
think,
proportionality
review,
because
it's
so
hard
to
say
what's
proportional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
use
the
word
"proportional",
because
the
other
thing
is
what
the
chief
justice
brought
out,
is
that
why
is
it
that
if
a
person
has
a
bad
reason,
i
mean,
why
should
a
bad
reason
justify
a
little
departure
rather
than
a
lot?
and
if
he
has
a
good
reason,
well,
why
doesn't
it
justify
a
lot
just
as
much
as
it
might
justify
a
little?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part,
they
said
that.
an
extraordinary
reduction
must
be
supported
by
extraordinary
circumstances.
what
worries
me
about
that
it
sounds
like
a
slogan.
i
would
think
an
extraordinary
reduction
must
be
supported
by
whatever
reasons
that
justify
the
extraordinary
reduction,
period.
and
it
also
sounds
like
you're
going
to
start
getting
a
mechanical
set
of
charts
and
things,
which
is
going
to
be
a
true
nightmare,
and
if
we
really
were
to
repeat
that
it
would
take
on
a
tremendous
force
of
generative
law
which
would
worry
me
quite
a
lot
because
i
just
think
it's
too
complex
to
reduce
to
a
formula.
what
you
want
is
a
reason
that
supports
the
sentence.
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--better
than
what?
better
than
justifies
it?
