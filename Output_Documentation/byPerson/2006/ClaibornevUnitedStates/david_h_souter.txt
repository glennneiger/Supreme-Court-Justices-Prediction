aren't
you
really
saying
that
the
most
weight
that
the
guidelines
can
be
given,
or
guidelines
can
be...
is
that...
i
apologize
for
my
voice...
the
most
weight
the
guidelines
can
be
given
is,
is
the
weight
of
necessary
advertence?
the
guidelines,
in
effect,
are
at
odds
with
the
rest
of
3553(a).
the
rest
of
them
say
individualized
sentencing.
the
guidelines,
in
effect,
says,
no,
sentencing
by
the
guidelines.
therefore,
in
order
to...
to
break
this,
in
effect,
logical
incommensurateness,
on
your
view,
i
think
the
most
that
you
can
concede
is
that
before
a
district
judge
sentences
finally,
he
must
show
that
he
has
considered
the
value
of
uniformity
as
something
different
from
individualized
sentencing,
but
that's
as
much
as
he
can
be
required
to
do.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i...
i
stand
corrected
here.
i'm
sorry.
