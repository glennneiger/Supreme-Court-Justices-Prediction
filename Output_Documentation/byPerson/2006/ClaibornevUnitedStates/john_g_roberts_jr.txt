chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
06-5618,
claiborne
versus
united
states.
mr.
dwyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
one
of
the
guides
for
reasonableness
review
is
what's
ordinary
in
a
particular
type
of
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
impossible
to
do
in
the
abstract.
if
you're
just
looking
at
a
particular
case,
you
have
no
idea
whether
5
years
is
reasonable
or
not.
there
has
to
be
a
background
to
it
so
that
you
know
that
in
this
type
of
case,
people
usually
get
a
sentence
of
3
years
or
they
usually
get
a
sentence
of
10
years.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
ordinary
is
going
to
be
a
judge...
a
driving
fact
in
determining
what's
reasonable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
you're
looking
at
not
just
the
number,
but
the
reasons.
in
other
words,
the
question
i
asked
earlier,
you've
got
nine
district
judges,
they
all
say
we
do
not
depart
downward
for
military
service,
and
you've
got
one
district
judge
that
says
we
do.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
can't
review
that
to
bring
about
some
uniformity
in
the
factors
that
are
appropriate
to
consider,
then
it's
essentially
a
lawless
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
my
particular
case,
what's
the
right
answer
for
the
court
of
appeals?
they've
got
two
cases
before
them.
one,
the
judge
departs
three
years
because
of
military
service.
the
prosecutor
appeals.
the
other,
the
judge
refuses
to
depart
because
of
military
service
and
the
defendant
appeals.
should
those...
what
should
happen
with
those
two
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
case.
that's
got
something
to
do
with
a
judgment
apart
from
the
particulars
of
the
case
about
whether
crack
should
be
treated
the
same
as
powdered
cocaine.
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
individual
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dwyer.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
dwyer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
mr.
dreeben's
parting
challenge?
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
your
client
gets
10
years?
you're
going
to
argue
that's
an
extraordinary
departure
from
the
guidelines,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
no.
06-5618,
claiborne
v.
united
states,
the
court
today
has
issued
a
per
curiam
statement
vacating
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
has
moved
in
light
of
petitionerâ€™s
death.
