mr.
christopher
lovell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decisions
in
nasd
and
national
gerimedical
determined
that
implied
immunity
is
not
favored,
is
justified
only
by
a,
quote,
"convincing
showing
of
clear
repugnancy",
and
then,
quote,
"only
to
the
minimum
extent
necessary.
"
close
quote.
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
the
securities
laws
work
to
permit
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
conduct
that
the
securities
laws
have
been
trying
to
stop
since
their
inception.
mr.
christopher
lovell
i
totally
disagree,
with
great
respect.
our
complaint
is
that
the
conspiracy
was
to
require
laddering
in
order
to
develop
pools
of
orders
right
after
the
stock
began
trading.
mr.
christopher
lovell
right.
mr.
christopher
lovell
that's
not
this
case,
your
honor.
that's
not
this
case.
we
say
that
the
underwriters
made
a
horizontal
conspiracy
to
inflate
the
prices
and
to
inflate
their
charges
as
a
result
by
requiring
these
laddering
orders
and
jointly
negotiating
together
the
amounts
of
the
laddering.
mr.
christopher
lovell
your
honor,
sorry
for
interrupting.
mr.
christopher
lovell
okay.
it's
like
a
lawyer
knows
what
to
say
and
knows
what
not
to
say.
this
has
been
established
for
years.
you
cannot
say
in
the
securities
business,
your
honor...
and
we
don't
know
this;
we
know
what
to
do
as
lawyers.
you
cannot
say
it's
a
quid
pro
quo,
i'm
going
to
negotiate
with
you
how
much
you
have
to
purchase.
that
type
of
conduct
created
pools
during
the
1920s
and
the
early
30s
which
manipulated
prices
to
unsustainable
levels
that
led
to
the
great
stock
market
crash
and
maybe
the
depression.
the
legislative
history
said:
we
want
to
stop
pools.
in
section
982
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
it
says,
quote,
"one
person
or
more
cannot
work
together
to
raise
prices.
"
we
allege
that
the
first
part
of
this
horizontal
conspiracy,
across
underwriters
and
across
ipos,
was
to
require
the
laddering
in
order
to
raise
prices.
mr.
christopher
lovell
well,
i'll
do
primary
jurisdiction
last,
your
honor.
my
view
is
that
to
bring
in
the
other
case
is,
in
effect,
to
exculpate
antitrust
violations.
on
this
narrow
case
that
we've
alleged,
under
connelly
versus
gibson
there
is
no
other
case.
anybody
who's
charged
with
murder
or
any
serious
conduct
could
say:
well,
you
can't
really
apply
that
because
this
is
the
other
case.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes,
yes.
mr.
christopher
lovell
we
totally
depend
on
the
horizontal
agreement,
your
honor.
the
case
rises
or
falls
on
the
horizontal
agreement
among
underwriters
to
require
that
which
the
securities
law--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--if
there's
no
market
power,
we're
not
alleging
that,
and
we
wouldn't
try
to
bring
that
case,
your
honor.
where
the
antitrust
laws,
as
general
clement
says,
have
their
reach
is
that
they
get
the
whole
elephant.
if
we
prove
that
the
underwriters
conspired
as
we
alleged,
and
there's
five
administrative
complaints
here...
it's
not
something
where
it's
is
a
strike
suit.
there's
five
administrative
complaints
finding
this
parallel
unlawful
conduct,
which
would
work
best
through
a
conspiracy.
and
we
have
our
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
they
worked
jointly
together
to
do
in
this
case
what's
always
been
prohibited
under
the
securities
laws.
mr.
christopher
lovell
it's
a
hypothetical.
we're
not
trying
to
do
an
individual
case.
i
don't
have
a
strong
position
on
it.
there
is
a
case
called
roth
berg
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york...
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
a
district
court
case,
that
recognized
an
antitrust
violation
in
a
single
stock
manipulation.
there
are
other
cases
called
shumway
and...
and
i
forget
the
other
case...
that
said,
no,
you
can't
have
it.
they've
gone
both
ways.
it
wouldn't
matter
to
our
case
at
all.
we're
trying
to
get
at...
the
securities
laws
are
transactional.
they
can't
get
at
a
big
wrong
like
this.
they
only
get
their
own
part
of
the
elephant.
the
antitrust
laws,
this
is
business
as
usual,
step
into
my
office.
as
general
clement
says,
the
antitrust
laws
come
if
we
prove
that
there
was
a
horizontal
agreement.
then
all
of
these
individual
efforts--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--no.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no,
your
honor.
it's
across
ipos
and
across
underwriters.
they
changed
their
business.
they
all
changed
the
business
at
about
the
same
time:
this
is
the
way
we're
going
to
operate.
we're
going
to
require
the
laddering
orders.
that
moves
the
price
up.
and
we're
going
to
require
another
type
of
tie-in
agreement
that
allows
the
underwriters
to
participate
in
the
customer's
profits
from
the
difference
between
the
ipo
price
and
the
inflated
prices
at
which
transaction
sales
were
made
right
after
the
ipo.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no
problem.
mr.
christopher
lovell
never.
mr.
christopher
lovell
we
wouldn't
bring
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes.
yes,
but--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--i
don't
think
it
fits
into
the
way
of
this
narrow
case
and
the
facts
that
are
presented
for
immunity
here,
which
the
congress
has
been
trying
to
stop
forever,
and
the
conduct's
spread
between
1997
and
2001
and
was
a
massive
violation
that
the
securities
laws
really
aren't
cut
out
to
address.
i
know
i'm
getting
off
your
question
a
little
bit,
but
in
the
nasdaq
antitrust
litigation
these
defendants
and
their
predecessors
agreed
to
keep
the
spreads
wide
in
the
over-the-counter
market.
there
were
rules
about
maximum
spreads.
there
were
many
rules,
many
regulations.
however,
it
was
never
permitted
in
the
securities
markets
for
all
the
underwriters
across
5,000
stocks...
we
only
proved
it
out
to
1600...
to
widen
their
spreads,
to
keep
their
bids
and
offers
wide.
billions
of
dollars...
the
justice
department
after
we
brought
the
case,
the
justice
department
brought
a
case.
the
entire
industry
was
changed.
you
can
now
trade
a
million
dollars
worth
of
stock
for
less
than
it
costs
to
change
your
tire
or
something.
and
it's
all
due
to
the
antitrust...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no
problem.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no.
the
basis
for
my
answer
is
two
levels
of
no
problem.
there's
not
a
problem
as
to
the
single
deal
and
there's
not
a
problem
as
to
saying
you
have
to
hold
the
stock.
that's
not
at
issue.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
what's
always
been
prohibited
is
to
create
pools
of
orders
to
drive
up
the
price
of
the
stock.
if
you
work
to
raise
the
price
of
the
stock,
which
this
was
all
geared
to
do,
after
it
came
public,
it
drives
prices
to
unsustainable
levels.
it
creates
a
lot
of
action
in
the
stock.
people
come
in
and
buy.
our
clients
buy
directly
from
the
defendants
who
are
driving
the
stock
up.
and
yes,
there
was
no
disclosure.
as
with
any
antitrust
conspiracy,
if
there
was
disclosure
there
could
have
been--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--the
sec
refers
the
customers
to
the
private
lawyers
if
you
complain.
the
securities
laws
are
totally
different
from
the
icc,
from
the
common
carrier
case.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes.
where?
the
specific
intent
of
congress
in
creating
the
securities
laws
was
to
create
private
remedies
which
are
available,
and
to
preserve
all
other
remedies,
including--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--no.
theoretically,
there
are
other
remedies
as
to
each
individual
client
for
what
each
individual
client
did.
no
one
can
address
in
a
securities
case
the
wrong
that
happens
here.
the
agreement.
that
can
only
be
addressed
as
general
clement
says
at
page
22
of
the
brief,
through
an
antitrust
case.
mr.
christopher
lovell
well,
the
sec
could
make
a
rule
to
prohibit...
to
further
supplement
the
protections.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes,
your
honor.
they
could
supplement
the
prohibitions--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--well,
it...
it...
i
think
it's
more
institutional
that
the
focus
has
always
been
transactional,
your
honor.
and
the
congress
clearly
in
982
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
clearly
prohibits
individual
or
joint
efforts
to
raise
prices,
empowers
private
investors
to
sue,
empowers
the
sec
to
sue--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--there
could
have
been
a
suit
by
now
but
it
has
never
happened.
mr.
christopher
lovell
in
the...
there's
huge
qualitative
differences
between
certain
types
of
conduct
which
has
always
been
accepted
and
was
not
prohibited
in
the
securities
laws
and
laddering
or
pools
of
orders
to
raise
prices
and
tie-in
agreements.
the
only
metaphor
i
can
throw
out,
your
honor,
is
that
we
know
how
far
we
can
say
and
what
we
can't
say,
the
brokers
always
know
this,
until
1997
to
2001
when
they...
they
changed
their
underwriting
businesses
to
go...
and
we,
we
allege
that
they
required,
induced,
solicited...
not
that
they
did
things
on
the
way...
close
to
the
line
or...
in
the,
what
had
always
been
the
accepted
area,
the
world
changed.
and
that
change
moved
into
the
territory
that
had...
sorry
for
hurrying...
that
had
always
been
prohibited.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes,
your
honor,
across
ipos
and
across
underwriters,
so
that--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--so
that
a
customer
couldn't
go
to
another
underwriter
for
a
different
deal.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no,
no.
the
public
customers
who
have
accounts
with
the
underwriters;
they're
also
brokerage
firms.
if
they
wanted
to
get
an
ipo
in
what
we
call
class
security,
the
technologies
securities,
they
had
to
pay--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--yeah.
they
had
to
pay
these
unlawful
charges
under
securities
laws,
no
matter
where
they
went.
and
in
terms
of
the
inextricably
intertwined,
it
is
the
qualitative
difference
that
stops
that.
i
think
behind
the
solicitor
general
and
the
sec's
proposal
is
a
fear
that
the
syndicates,
the
underwriters
are
vulnerable
to
an
antitrust
case
because
they
operate
together.
that's
not
true.
there's
never
been
a
case
precisely
like
this;
and
the
underwriters
as
brokers,
as
market
makers,
they
operate
together
and
cooperatively
all
the
time.
five
years
goes
by.
seven
years
goes
by.
there's
no
antitrust
case--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--they
agreed
to
inflate
prices
in
precisely
the
way
the
securities
laws
have
always
prohibited.
they
agreed
to
inflate
prices
and
they
agreed
to
make
tie-in
agreements
that
have
always
been
prohibited
under
the
securities
laws,
to
participate
in
the
profits
from
the
inflated
prices,
which
they
were
not
permitted
to
participate
in.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no.
but
in
this
narrow
case,
it
happens
to
be
that
the
method
that
they
went
to,
which
was
always
a
guaranteed
method
to
drive
up
prices
and
to
participate,
was...
had
always
been
prohibited
by
the
securities
laws.
it
is
not
the
test.
the
test
for
the
antitrust
claim
is
merely
this:
they
wanted
to
make
an
agreement
to
inflate
prices
and
they
wanted
to
make
an
agreement
to
inflate
their
charges.
and
if
a
customer
came
to
this
underwriting
trust
at
the
time
to
deal
with
them,
they
had
to
do
this
type
of
transaction
to
inflate
the
price,
and
they
had
to
pay
the
underwriting
extra--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--that
the
actual
facts
show
that
congress
wanted
this
claim
to
be
brought.
certain...
congress
is
well
aware
of
the
nasdaq
antitrust
litigation
and
of
the
salomon
brothers
antitrust
litigation,
both
antitrust
claims
in
the
securities
markets.
both
situations
where
the
diligent
professionals
at
the
sec
were
criticized
by
the
congressional
oversight
people
for
not
finding
out
what
was
going
on,
perhaps,
and
that
the
antitrust
bar
did
and
brought
the
case,
and
then
the
doj
brought
it
and
then
there
was
questions.
mr.
christopher
lovell
bingo.
that...
we
live
with
all
that,
your
honor.
to
quote...
sorry,
sorry.
[laughter]
mr.
christopher
lovell
no,
no...
but
we
agree
on
every
one.
but
to
go
back--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
there's
five
administrative
proceedings
that
have,
that
have
come
forth
since
we...
we
filed
first,
and
there
was
nothing.
and...
but
since
then
there
have
been
a
lot
of
administrative
proceedings.
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
parallel
unusual...
unlawful
conduct
is
occurring
in
a
way
that
the
horizontal
people
who
are
doing
it
inflate
their
prices
at
the
expense
of
the
public,
would
satisfy
any
test.
mr.
christopher
lovell
your
honor,
i
think
you
have...
for
the
good
of
the
country,
i
think
you
have
to
follow
the
facts
and
find
out
if
these
people
conspired
as
alleged.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes.
sure.
mr.
christopher
lovell
again
it
is
the
qualitative
difference.
everybody
knows...
and
the
sec
does
want
ipo
prices
to
be
fixed,
just
like
in
the
nasd
case,
they
only
wanted
one
price
for
the
mutual
fund
shares
because
people
could
be
disadvantaged.
however,
everybody
also
knows
under
section
982
and
section
17
of
the
securities
act,
that
you
don't
go
over
and
rig
the
after
market,
not
even
in
one
stock,
let
alone
what
we
allege,
across
stocks.
and
with
regard
to
the
question
earlier,
your
honor,
about
how
congress--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
lovell
well--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--you
look,
you
compare
the
cases
to
the
language
in
the
complaint.
in
paragraphs
4
and
5
of
the
complaint
we
say
that
they
agreed
to
require
laddering,
they
agreed
to
require
this.
we
don't
say
that
they
made
any...
any
hints
or
legitimate
activity.
we're
held
to
that
burden
of
proof.
you
look
at
the
cases,
required
has
always
been
unlawful.
to
require
a
pool
of
orders
to
drive
up
the
prices...
always
unlawful.
and
congress
during
the
1990s
did
narrow
the
securities
laws;
and
they
took
away
treble
damages
as
to
rico,
and
they
stopped
resorting
to
state
court,
where
the
standards
weren't
as
stringent
as
under
the
ps
law...
for
class
action.
however,
they
knew
about
these
antitrust
cases
that
had
saved
billions
of
dollars
for
consumers.
they
applauded
them.
and
they
reenacted
the
savings
clause
that
says
all
rights
and
remedies
are--
preserved.
mr.
christopher
lovell
well,
they
just
said
that
they...
congress...
that's
too
strong
a
statement.
the
specific
congress
people
involved
were
glad
that
the...
the
wrongdoing
was
uncovered
and
said
as
much
and
wrote
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
sec,
and
said
why...
why
wasn't
it
found
sooner?
but
they
did
not
touch
these
antitrust
actions.
number
one,
they
come
very
infrequently.
number
two,
they've
done
great
benefit
for
the
securities
markets
and
for
the
participants
in
the
securities
markets,
and
even
for
the
defendants
themselves.
they
forced
the
defendants
to
operate
by
talent
and
bring
out
their
best,
and
not
resort
to
what
the
problems
for
the
public
always
is--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--no...
no.
mr.
christopher
lovell
the
sec...
and
this
is
the
first
immunity
case
before
the
court
where
the
sec
and
the
doj
both
are
in
favor
of
not
having
substantive
immunity.
they
both
oppose
immunity.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no.
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--i...
i...
that's
the
only
way
i
can
see
it.
but
if
your
honor
looks
at
the
questions
that
the
sec
answered
to
second
circuit,
the
sec
said
they
couldn't
say
how
the
current
laws
couldn't
work
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
future
cases
might
present
a
closer
case,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
protected
conduct.
and
we
could
live
with--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--we
could
live
with
that.
on
the
other
hand,
applied
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
it
was
held
in
cantor
versus
detroit
edison,
428
us
579,
which
didn't
make
it
into
our
brief,
that
applied
antitrust
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
as
we
brief,
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
from
your
honors
that
say
that
you
don't
have
to
plead
in
the
complaint
to
negate
an
affirmative
defense.
i
don't
think
that
unlawful
conduct
under
the
securities
laws
is
entitled
to
more
protection
than
free
speech
or
some
of
the
conduct
in
these
other
cases;
and
i...
and
we've
opposed
the
inextricably
intertwined
standard
as
particularly
inappropriate
where
an
affirmative
defense
is
involved.
nonetheless,
we
could
live
with
that,
if
it
came
down.
and
we
think
the
complaint
already
lives
with
it.
the
complaint
has,
from
paragraph
53
through
paragraph
63,
a
number
of
allegations
of
joint
conduct
to
do
things
which
are
clearly
unlawful
under
the
securities
laws.
it
does
have
one
allegation
about
holding
road
shows.
on
its
own,
that's
permissible.
we
don't
have
a
footnote
that
says
this
is
permissible
on
its
own.
that
may
have
caused
somewhat
of
the
problem
for...
for
people.
but
reading
the
complaint
as
a
whole,
paragraph
5
says
that
these
later
paragraphs
i
just
referred
to
show
how
the
time
in
the
syndicates
was
abused.
and
i'm
going
back
to
this
vulnerability
point.
the
defendants
are
vulnerable
to
an
antitrust
class
action
plaintiffs
saying,
you
conspired.
yes.
but
it
only
happens...
it
only
happens
once
in
a
while.
and
think
about
it.
if
they
abuse
their
time
in
the
syndicates
to
create
a
conspiracy
of
this
nature,
to
do
something
that's
always
been
prohibited
under
the
securities
laws,
and
it's
clearly
prohibited
under
the
antitrust
laws,
why
should
we
bend
over
backwards
to
protect
that
every
five
years
or
seven
years?
the
normal--
mr.
christopher
lovell
--the
public
carrier
cases,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
sea
carriers
and
the
air
carriers
have
had
primary
jurisdiction
as
an
approach.
in
order
to
keep
it
uniform,
they
kept
the
rate
and
then
there
would
be
questions
on
the
rate.
so
both
for
administrative
discretion
and
factfinding,
the
court
said
that's
their
baby,
we're
going
to
stay
out.
the
securities
laws
have
always
been
totally
different.
the
antitrust
laws...
it
was
a
little
bit
patterned
after
the
antitrust
laws.
section
9(e)
is
like
the
antitrust
laws,
15
u.s.c.
15.
the
antitrust
laws
said
we
want
private
attorney
generals
to
go
out
and
sue.
the
securities
laws
said
we
want
to
give
the
remedies
under
this
act,
new
remedies.
we
want
to
preserve...
preserve
all
other
remedies,
any
and
all
other
remedies.
the
single
damages
point
raised
by
the
defendants
in
the
same
section
is
only
a
limit
on
recovery.
it's
not
a
limit
on
the
rights
and
remedies.
so
the
answer
to
primary
jurisdiction
is
that
it's
always
worked
this
way,
that
the
private
plaintiff
is
supposed
to
sue
in
court.
he's
expressly
empowered
under
securities
laws
to
sue
in
court,
as
he's
expressly
empowered
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
the
courts
have
always
resolved
the
issue.
mr.
christopher
lovell
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
times
that
it's
come
up
before
in
the
nasdaq
case,
united
states
versus
morgan,
the
courts
have
said
business
as
usual.
they
used
the
usual
implied
immunity
standard
and
they
resolve
it,
as
usually
happens.
in
richey,
the
richey
case
and
a
few
other
cases
we've
either
said...
not
implied
immunity,
but
we've
either
said
we're
not
going
to
get
involved,
it's
the
agency's,
it's
the
icc's
responsibility,
or
it
was
referred
one
time
in
the
richey
case
to
the
old
commodity
exchange
commission,
which
then
declined
to
take
the
referral
because...
that
was
an
appropriate
referral
because
it
had
to
do
with
the
exchange
rules.
mr.
christopher
lovell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
lovell
never
happened
before,
and
it's
contrary
to
the...
what
congress
wants.
in
a
different
statutory
context,
it
was
what
congress
wanted
for
uniformity.
mr.
christopher
lovell
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
presence
here
of
the
sec
complaints,
the
sec's
fact-finding,
saying
that
things
got
out
of
hand
during
this
time
and
the
law
was
broken
on
a
widespread
basis,
indicate
that
we
are
not
coming
forth
with
weak
facts.
and
i
also
agree
that
in
the
securities
context,
primary
jurisdiction
has
not
had
the
basis
it's
had
in
other
legislative
contexts
where
uniformity
was
desired.
thank
you.
