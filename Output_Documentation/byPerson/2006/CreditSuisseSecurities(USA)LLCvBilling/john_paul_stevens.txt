justice

paul

mr.
shapiro,
to
what
extent
has
the
sec
regulated
the
specific
vertical
restraints
that
are
alleged
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
laddering,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
we
to
assume
that
if
the
allegations
are
true,
which
they
of
course
may
not
be,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the...
of
the
securities
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
allegations
in
this
are
quite
different
from
gordon.
there
you
have
got
a
horizontal...
allegedly
horizontal
agreement.
here
you
have
got
a
vertical
agreement
which
it
seems
to
me
depends
on
non-disclosure
for
it
work
at
all.
if
there
been
full
disclosure
of
all
these
laddering
and
flippings
i
don't
see
how
in
the
world
you
would
ever
get
a...
an
antitrust
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
between
this
case
and
gordon
is
that
this
case,
the
heart
of
their
allegations
are
failure
to
disclose
which
is
quintessentially
the
sec's
business,
making
sure
disclosures
are
right.
i
don't
think
if
there
were
disclosure,
they
would
have
a
problem
in
this
case.
am
i
missing
something
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
is
there
was
no
disclosure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
allegation
is
the
agreement...
the
agreement
not
to
disclose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
more
question,
mr.
shapiro.
supposing
there
had
been
full
disclosure
here.
do
you
think
there
would
be
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
agreeing
on
what
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
preliminary
before
the
ipo.
but
what
they
did
after
the
ipo,
would
that
violate
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
laddering
and
so
forth?
if
it
were
fully
disclosed,
would
it
be
unlawful
under
either
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can
see
how
they
would
affect
the
market
if
they
were
disclosed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
your
conspiracy
allegation
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
only
one
underwriter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
critical
to
your
case
that
there
are
multiple
underwriters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
thought
that
the
activities
of
the
multiple
underwriters
were
comparable
to
a
single
joint
venture?
in
many
respects
they're
like
a
joint
venture.
would
that
mean
your
whole
case
could
collapse?
in
other
words,
i'm
really
wondering
to
what
extent
you're
depending
on
your
horizontal
agreement
as
opposed
to
the
vertical
arrangements
like
laddering
and
flipping
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
had
just
been
the
vertical
agreements
and
if
they
had
been
fully
disclosed,
there
would
no
antitrust
violation,
would
there?
if
there
had
just
been
publicly
disclosed
agreement
by
one
underwriter
with
the
purchasers
to
engage
in
these
activities,
there
would
be
no
violation,
would
there?
