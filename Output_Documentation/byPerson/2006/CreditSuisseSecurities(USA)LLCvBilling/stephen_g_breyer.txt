justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happened
in
respect
to
the
sec?
what
about
primary
jurisdiction?
that's
what
i
wondered
as
i
read
this.
nobody
mentions
it.
but
there's
certainly
a
lot
of
precedent
in
the
area
in
this
kind
of
thing.
you
ask
the
agency,
have
to
go
to
the
agency,
see
what
they
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
wonder
about
primary
jurisdiction.
you
put
a
burden
on
the,
on
the
plaintiffs
to
go
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
could
take
a
range
of
positions.
it
might
say
this
is
absolutely
unlawful,
but
it's
close
enough
we
think
an
antitrust
court
has
no
business
mucking
around
in
this.
or
it's
unlawful
and
we
don't
care.
or,
it's
not...
in
which
case
they
could
bring
their
suit.
or
it's...
it's
not
unlawful
but
we
don't
care,
or
it's
not
unlawful
and
we
do
care.
i
mean,
there
is
a
range
of
positions
they
could
take
which
was
the
purpose
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine,
to
see
in
the
context
of
the
particular
conduct,
not
general
but
in
the
context
of
the
particular
conduct,
what
the
agency
thought
about
this
in
terms
of
its
regulatory
mission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
in
respect
to
the
particular
conduct
at
issue
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
the
petitioners
have
not
had
an
opportunity,
i
would
think...
they
filed
a
complaint.
but
they've
not
had
an
opportunity
to
argue
this
out
in
front
of
the
sec
with
particular
evidence,
with
particular
witnesses,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
even
then,
why
do
you
take
the
other
position?
it
is
pretty
easy
to
imagine
the
sec,
under
some
circumstances,
deciding
that's
a
proper
way
to
market
securities,
to
have
some
kinds
of
agreements
between
ipos
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
see
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
possible.
i'm
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
i
mean,
if
you're
worried
about
taking
authority
from
the
department
to
prosecute
territorial
restrictions
as
some
kind
of
blatant
price
fix,
that's
not
in
front
of
us.
so
this
doesn't
have
to
be
precedent
for
that.
you're
talking
about
this
case.
and
there,
i
think
the
respondent...
the
petitioners
here
say
that
my
goodness,
we
don't
see
any
way
that
a
district
court
is
going
to
be
able
to
start
talking
about
whether
this
evidence
is
protected.
what
does
that
mean,
protected?
maybe
protected
here,
because
they
have
thought
about
it,
but
there
will
be
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
sec
hasn't
thought
about
the
particular
conduct.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
prove.
i'm
back
to
justice
alito.
how
is
anybody
going
to
administer
the
standard
that
you
are
asking
the
court
to
enunciate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
might
well
be,
because
the
reasoning
would
be,
which
i
find
very
strong,
is
that
as
soon
as
you
make
an,
bring
an
antitrust
court
in,
you're
talking
about
juries
and
treble
damages.
and
as
soon
as
that
happens,
the
people
who
are
subject
to
it
stay
miles
away
from
the
conduct
that,
in
fact,
would
subject
them
to
liability.
and
yet
staying
miles
away,
they
will
not
engage
in
conduct
that,
a,
the
sec
might
believe
is
permissible,
or,
b,
actually
favor.
where
you
get
a
complex
complaint
like
yours,
that
begins
to
ring
true,
that
argument.
and
that's
what's
concerning
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
say
in
respect
to
that
is
the
other
side
says
it's
common
to
try
to
what's
called
make
a
book
or
something.
i
don't
know
these
terms.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
they
do,
what
happens
is
that
the
marketer
goes
out
and
he
asks
people:
what's
your
plan?
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
next
month?
what's
your
plan
for
this
stock?
hold
it?
not?
it
doesn't
require
much
imagination
to
see
how
certain
answers
to
that
kind
of
question
could
be
brought
by
a
plaintiff
in
perfectly
good
faith
as
evidence
that
there's
an
agreement
that
next
month
they
will
pay
more
for
the
stock
and
next
month
they'll
pay
a
lot
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem...
i'd
be
repeating
it.
we're
not
talking
about,
say,
your
case.
i
don't
know
what
your
evidence
is.
but
let's
imagine
a
case
where
the
evidence
of
just
what
you
said
consists
of
some
rather
ambiguous
discussions
which
might
be
characterized
in
a
variety
of
ways,
including
the
way
the
way
the
plaintiff
wants
to
characterize
it,
who
would
repeat
the
very
words
you
just
said.
now,
the
issue,
it
seems
to
me
here,
is
in
light
of
that
possibility,
do
we
want
an
antitrust
judge
to
say
whether
that's
so?
i
know
you
do.
or
do
you
want
the
sec
to
say
whether
that's
so
in
the
particular
case?
or
that's
why
i
thought
of
primary
jurisdiction:
maybe
first
send
it
to
the
sec.
what's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
an
agreement
among
underwriters,
among
underwriters,
which
says
the
following:
we
agree
that
we
go...
when
we
go
on
our
tour,
we
will
be
certain
to
ask
the
potential
purchasers
whether
they
plan
to
hold
this
stock
for
at
least
a
month.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
know
that
isn't
a
disguise
when
they
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--ah,
ah.
what
they've
said
was...
you
see,
they
have
the
same
allegations.
i
don't
know
how
to...
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
get
damages
for
that
from
the
sec?
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
bad
conduct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
lose,
your
client...
suppose
all
these
bad
things
happen
and
you
don't
have
an
antitrust
claim.
is
there
somewhere
in
the
law
that
you
can
get
damages?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
at
issue
here
is
not
whether
you
get
a
remedy.
it's
whether
you
get
treble
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
are
the
words
you
use
in
the
opinion,
that
would
separate
your
case,
where
it
is
like
price
fixing
and
so
forth,
to
charge
them,
from
the
case
that
they're
worried
about,
which
is
where
the
evidence
is,
to
prove
the
allegation
is,
really
involves
activity
that
could
be
quite
legitimate?
now,
now...
what
words
would
i
write
in
the
opinion
that
in
your
opinion
would
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
what
about...
listen
to
what
i'm
about
to
say.
i'm
thinking
of
the
standard.
the
standard
would
be
where
the
allegations
are
such,
where
the
case
is
such
that...
to
go
further...
that,
one,
it
is
an
allegation
of
a
claim
of
illegality;
is
price
fixing,
in
price
fixing;
and
it
is
of
longstandingly
prohibited
under
the
securities
law;
and
there
is
evidence
to
support
that,
of...
strong
evidence
to
support
it,
or
the
evidence
in
support
thereof
is
not
primarily
evidence
simply
of
asking
the
jury
to
draw
inferences
from
conduct
that
is
protected.
under
those
circumstances
there
is
no
immunity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
it's...
i
mean,
you
know--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
always...
i
think
the
standard
i
was
more
or
less
talking
about
is
pretty
close
to
what
the
sg
says.
and
i
think
he
says
that...
that...
that
justice
alito's
point,
which
is
certainly
a
good
point,
is
that
you
would
have
to
allege
facts
such
that
it
was
clear
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
you
weren't
resting
your
case
on
the
conduct
that
was...
that's
what
he
means
by
protected...
and
there's
an
ongoing
obligation,
it
says,
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge
to
be
sure
that
the
case
isn't
really
growing
out
of
this
conduct
that
is
arguably
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you,
you
could
live
with
the
sg--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
all
agree,
say
a
group
of
underwriters,
that
for
the
next
we
will
insist
that
every
customer,
whatever
price
we
charge,
will
pay
30
percent
more
for
50
percent
more
shares
next
month.
absolutely
illegal,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
write
it
down,
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
securities
world
an
initial
public
offering
(ipo)
normally
involves
a
new
company
that
wishes
to
offer
shares
to
potential
investors
who
may
or
may
not
buy
their
shares
and
middleman
groups
of
underwriters
and
they
form
syndicates
that
help
the
new
company
market
their
shares
to
the
investors.
now,
typically
the
syndicates
estimate
a
rough
price
and
then
together
with
the
firm’s
representatives
they
go
on
what’s
called
the
“road
show”.
where
they
meet
with
potential
investors
and
they
get
an
idea
how
the
investors
are
feeling
about
the
shares,
they
test
the
demand
for
the
shares
at
different
prices
and
they
try
to
work
out
a
best
initial
price
for
shares
which
is
called
“book
building”.
now,
in
this
case
investors
have
brought
an
antitrust
action
against
various
underwriters
that
work
in
syndicates
and
in
that
antitrust
action
they
claim
that
the
underwriters
during
the
road
shows
unlawfully
agreed
to
engage
in
several
improper
practices.
the
practices
involves,
selling
the
shares
initially
at
a
low
price
and
that
makes
them
very
valuable
to
the
investors,
and
then
in
return
insisting
that
the
investors
agree
either
to
buy
more
shares
later
in
the
after
market
when
the
stock
gets
going
and
continuously
escalating
prices
and
thereby
making
it
appear
that
the
price
of
the
share
is
great
just
rising
all
the
time,
that’s
called
“laddering”
or
you
have
to
buy
other
shares
from
me
that
nobody
would
want
they
are
unpopular
shares,
or
you
have
to
pay
me,
the
underwriter,
a
higher
commission
later
when
you
finally
do
business
with
me
in
some
other
matter
that’s
called
“pay
less
now,
pay
more
later”
and
all
of
these
are
undesirable
and
unlawful.
but
the
legal
question
is
whether
in
respect
of
this
kind
of
antitrust
claim
the
securities
laws
implicitly
supplant
the
antitrust
laws
whether
they
preclude
that
antitrust
claim,
do
they
wipe
it
up
basically
or
can
the
two
sets
of
laws
coexist
together.
now,
the
law
assumes
that
they
can’t
coexist
unless
one
is
plainly
repugnant
to
the
other
that’s
a
phrase
meaning
“really
plainly
incompatible”
are
they
incompatible
or
not
incompatible?
we
think
they
are
clearly
incompatible.
now
in
deciding
whether
these
two
sets
of
laws
are
incompatible
four
criteria
are
laid
down
in
our
cases,
three
of
them
are
clearly
met
here.
first,
do
the
securities
laws
give
full
authority
to
regulatory
agencies
to
supervise
this
kind
of
thing?\
the
answer
is
absolutely
yes.
second,
have
the
regulators
actively
exercise
that
authority,
have
they
police
the
markets
in
respect
to
this
kind
of
activity?
third,
does
the
conflict
or
the
risk
of
conflict
effect
securities
practices
that
lie
squarely
within
the
area
offinancial
activity
that
the
securities
law
seeks
to
regulate?
absolutely
yes,
but
the
central
difficulty
in
the
case
concerns
a
fourth
criteria
and
that’s
this,
is
there
a
significant
risk
that
if
you
have
both
sets
of
laws
applying
they
will
produce
conflicting
guidance
or
requirements,
duties,
privileges,
standards
there
will
be
a
conflict,
the
investors
here
say
no
there
wont
be
a
conflict.
after
all
the
activities
and
practices
were
attacking
are
unlawful
under
both
sets
of
laws,
securities
laws
and
they
antitrust
laws
so
how
could
there
be
a
conflict?
well
we
will
assume
that,
that’s
right
that
they
are
unlawful
under
both
sets
of
laws
but
we
still
find
a
very
serious
conflict.
now
the
conflict
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
drawing
a
line
between
what
is
lawful
and
unlawful
in
this
area
is
a
very
difficult
task
its
requires
a
fine
line
which
changes
a
lot
from
time-to-time
and
it
requires
considerable
expertise
to
know
what
that
line
is
and
whether
it
would
change.
for
example,
how
do
you
separate
laddering
which
involves
getting
an
investor
to
promise
that
he
will
buy
later
at
a
higher
price
and
that’s
unlawful.
from
similar
activity
which
is
absolutely
lawful
during
the
road
show
determining
whether
an
investor
will
later
want
to
buy
the
stock
at
a
higher
price
or
a
lower
price,
or
the
same
price
and
it
can
be
very,
very
difficult
to
decide
whether
particular
evidence
say
of
a
conversation
between
about
later
purchases,
possible
later
purchases
does
that
show
lawful
activity
or
unlawful
activity.
now
that’s
hard
for
experts
to
know
sometimes
but
here
the
antitrust
laws
leave
those
questions
up
to
non-expert
juries
which
are
likely
to
reach
different
decisions
about
very
similar
matters,
and
the
only
way
for
the
underwriters
to
be
save
from
that
antitrust
attack
would
be
for
them
to
stay
far
away
from
anything
that
counts
as
borderline.
but
the
securities
laws
permit
the
firms
indeed
they
encourage
the
firms
to
go
right
up
to
the
border.
well
the
law
cannot
and
should
not
at
one
and
the
same
time
both
tell
the
underwriters
you
should
engage
in
activities
near
but
not
quite
over
the
border
and
you
can’t
or
shouldn’t
engage
in
activity
near
the
border,
that
add
in
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
or
people
like
the
plaintiffs
have
an
adequate
remedy
under
the
securities
law.
well
put
those
things
together
and
we
think
that
there
isn’t
a
great
need
for
the
antitrust
remedy
and
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
great
risk
of
conflict.
given,
the
great
risk
of
conflict
in
practice
we
think
the
two
sets
of
laws
given
that
the
other
three
criteria
are
satisfied
are
incompatible
and
therefore
securities
law
precludes
this
kind
of
antitrust
action.
for
these
and
other
reasons
that
we
set
forth
in
our
opinion
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
determination
which
was
to
the
contrary.
justice
stevens
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
justice
thomas
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion,
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
