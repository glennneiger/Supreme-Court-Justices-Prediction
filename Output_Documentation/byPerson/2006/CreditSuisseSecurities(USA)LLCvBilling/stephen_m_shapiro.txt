mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pivotal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
court's
decisions
in
gordon
and
nasd
require
implied
antitrust
immunity
as
the
district
court
believed.
and
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
yes.
the
'33
and
'34
acts
were
of
course
passed
for
the
very
purpose
of
regulating
ipos
and
alleged
market
manipulation.
and
this
court
has
referred
to
these
laws
as
the
anchor
of
federal
economic
policy
in
the
securities
field.
and
under
these
laws
the
sec
has
laid
down
detailed
regulations
applicable
to
the
very
practices
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
with
active
supervision
by
the
sec
and
the
nasd.
and
it
has
done
this
with
full
understanding
that
syndicated
underwriting
is
inherently
concerted
action.
an
underwriting
requires
joint
action
in
accumulating
information
and
setting
the
price
of
the
offering
along
with
allotting
shares
to
customers.
now
the
gordon
and
nasd
cases
apply
directly
here
because
of
the
danger
of
inconsistency
and
conflict
which
the
sec
cited.
as
in
cases
of
this
court
in
the
past,
like
nasd
and
gordon
and
later
trinko,
congress
required
this
expert
administrative
agency
to
take
competition
into
account
when
issuing
its
standards.
and
review
in
antitrust
courts
across
the
country
would
once
again
raise
the
danger
of
false
positives
and
conflicts
and
wasteful
redundancy.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
no,
your
honor,
it
is
very
express
in
75
and
then
again
in
the
96.
capital
formation,
investor
protection
and
competition
have
to
be
weighed
against
each
other
by
the
sec,
and
in
gordon
this
court
attached
great
importance
to
that
standard,
which
differs
from
the
competition
first
standard
of,
the
antitrust
laws
impose.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
sec
regulates
the...
the
alleged
tie-ins
and
it
regulates
the
alleged
excessive
compensation
claims.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
laddering,
tying,
and
excessive
compensation.
and
it's
had
a
number
of
enforcement
actions.
its
regulation
m
is
focused
exactly
on
those
practices.
it's
issued
very
detailed
guidance
in
a
document
that
we
attach
to
our
petition
appendix
on
what
constitutes--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well
the
sec
has
said
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
and
they
draw
very
fine
lines
in
this
area,
your
honor.
and
if,
in
fact,
the
sec
concludes
it
is
a
tie-in
under
its
finely
calibrated
standards,
then
yes.
but
that's
the
critical
issue
here.
it
is
very
easy
to
term
these
things
excessive
compensation
or
tie-ins,
but
when
the
nasd
looked
at
a
real
complaint
of
this
sort
in
the
invemed
case
it
found
that
there
was
no
excessive
compensation
and
no
commercial
bribery.
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
this
case
it
took
no
position
on
the
merit
of
the
underlying
claims,
but
it
said
that
there
would
be
serious
problems
if
antitrust
law
were
applied
to
these
allegations.
it
would
interfere
with
the
agency's
ability
to
define
what
is
manipulation
and
to
amend
its
definitions.
it
has
ongoing
rulemaking
proceedings
right
now
addressed
to
this
issue;
and
it
said
further
that
it
would
discourage
underwriters
from
going
up
to
the
line
of
prohibition,
which
is
very
important
in
this
area.
because
if
they
don't
step
over
the
line
and
they
engage
in
book
building
conversations,
that's
critical
to
setting
the
right
price
for
the
ipo.
and
so--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
think
part
of
the
repugnance
analysis
here
should
focus
on
the
fact
that
these
securities
claims
have
simply
been
repleaded
as
antitrust
claims.
congress
wasn't
aware
of
any
problem
of
this
sort;
nobody
had
attempted
to
replead
securities
violations
like
tie-ins
and
excessive
compensation
as
antitrust
claims.
and
congress
of
course
relied--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
doesn't
refer
to
antitrust
cases.
those
were
references
to
state
law
remedies
that
congress
later
contracted
with
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no.
they
referred
to
other
claims,
your
honor,
but
they
don't
refer
to
antitrust.
so
we
don't
believe--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
don't
believe--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
think...
we
think
they
don't
apply
to
antitrust,
and
in
gordon
and
nasd
those
same
provisions
were
in
place
but
that
didn't
deter
the
court
from
finding
them--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
the
court
did.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they...
well,
they...
they
don't
pertain
to
antitrust.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
those
provisions
they
are
talking
about
state
causes
of
action
and
there's
no
reference
to
antitrust
as
such
in
them.
that's
quite
different
from
trinko
where
there
was
an
antitrust
savings
clause
that
went
on
in
detail
about
saving
the
antitrust
cause
of
action.
the
danger
of
conflict
that
the
sec
is
talking
about
here
is
an
acute
danger
to
its
ability
to--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
the
reason
it
doesn't
get
mentioned
is
in
that
gordon
the
court
held
primary
jurisdiction
was
not
a
fix
for
this
kind
of
conflict.
and
here
the
sec
has
expressed
its
opinion
in
its
amicus
briefs
already.
the
court
is
aware
of
those
positions
laid
out
in
our
cert
petition--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
the
conflict
is
different,
but
it's
really
quite
a
more
serious
conflict
than
it
was
in
gordon.
in
gordon
the
only
concern
was
the
sec
might
reinstitute
fixed
rates
in
the
future,
and
it
never
did
that
in
30
years.
here
the
sec
says
the
conflict
goes
to
our
ability
to
define
manipulation
and
to
amend
our
rules
which
we're
in
the
process
of
doing
and
we
can't
have
conduct
deterred.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
sec
in
the
lower
courts
advocated
dismissal
of
the
complaints;
and
in
the
supreme
court,
of
course,
they've...
they've
urged
for
a
vacator
of
the
lower
court
decision.
and
the
brief
of
the
sg
echoes
many
of
the
concerns
that
the
sec
expressed
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think
gordon
is
very
informative
on
that
point.
it
rejected
primary
jurisdiction
because
the
agency's
views
were
already
known
to
the
court.
here
the
sec
has
filed
a
40-page
submission
in
the
district
court
explaining
that
the
suit
has
to
be
dismissed
because
of
conflict
with
the
administrative
scheme.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
the
particular
conduct
at
issue--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
what
this
court
said
in
gordon
was
that
it's
a
legal
question
whether
there
is
potential
interference
with
the
administrative
scheme
for
us
to
decide
the
sec's
views
are
entitled
to
considerable
deference,
the
court
said.
but
if
they've
been
submitted
in
the
form
of
amicus
briefs,
that
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
the
repugnance.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
absolutely
right.
in
that
case,
where
the
court
did
refer
an
antitrust
issue,
the
agency
declined
to
take
the
reference.
and
here
there
there
was
a
factual
issue
the
agency
was
supposed
to
opine
on.
here
we
have
a
pure
legal
question,
the
court
has
held,
of
potential
repugnance
with
the
sec
scheme.
that's
for
the
court
to
decide.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
what
the
sec
says
is
that
if
the
conduct
is
ordinary
book
building,
communications
about
future
transactions,
at
future
prices,
there's
no
misconduct
to
be
disclosed.
it
is
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
complaint
alleges
an
antitrust
violation.
just
that
there
was
agreement
to
engage
in
tie-ins,
and
an
agreement
not
to--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
certainly
highlights
why
this
is
an
sec
case
and
not
an
antitrust
case,
it
seems
to
me,
because
that...
disclosure
is
for
this
administrative
agency
to
wrestle
with,
and
it
has
made
clear
that
investor
welfare
will
be
harmed
and
issuer
welfare
will
be
harmed
if
these
sensitive
questions
are
taken
from
it
and
are
frozen
by
antitrust
judgments.
that
was
the
problem
the
court
faced
in
nasd
and
it
was
the
problem
the
court
faced
in
gordon.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
part,
i
would
say
yes,
there
was
an
agreement
in
restraint
of
trade--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yeah,
that's
their
theory.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
really
what
they
are
alleging
is
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
securities
laws
here,
that
had
some...
what
they
claim,
a
market
effect.
and
it
is
the
agreement
that
they
contend
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
or
they
refer
to
the
compensation
payments
as
excessive
commercial
bribes.
they
say
that
violates
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
trouble
is
no
matter
how
you
phrase
this,
no
matter
how
they
could
amend
their
pleading,
inherent
in
the
case
are
challenges
to
tie-ins
and
alleged
excessive
compensation
payments
that
under
the
securities
laws
have
to
be
regulated
by
the
sec.
the
government
has
to
speak
with
one
voice
on
this
issue
under
one
set
of
standards,
or
administrative
law
gets
frozen.
and
there's
a
huge
deterrent
effect
on
underwriters.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
under
these
two
decisions
of
the
court,
nasd
and
gordon,
there
has
to
be
active
supervision
or
pervasive
regulation
by
the
agency,
and
then
a
direct
conflict
with
what
the
sec
is
trying
to
accomplish.
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
can
be
regulated
even
under
the
antitrust
laws
under
those
standards.
nasd
and
gordon
didn't
stop
all
antitrust
litigation
in
its
tracks.
only
things
that
were
within
the
agency's
supervisory
jurisdiction
to
present--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
'33
act,
if
you
look
at
the
act,
every
provision
in
it
is
focused
on
ipos.
it
is
state
of
the
art
comprehensive
legislation.
the
'34
act
in
three
separate
provisions
gives
the
sec
power
to
define
manipulation.
then
it
has
rulemaking
power
and
then
it
has
exemption
power.
this
is
comprehensive.
it
is
far
more
pervasive
than
the
kind
of
regulation
that
was
before
the
court
in
nasd.
in
that
case,
there
was
just
unexercised
rulemaking
power.
here
we
have
got
voluminous
regulations,
we
have
interpretations,
we
have
many
enforcement
actions
aimed
at
this
very
same
conduct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
government
says--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
think
immunity
extends
beyond
what
is
expressly
permitted
by
the
sec.
the
way
the
court
phrased
it
in
nasd
was
things
that
are
connected
to
the
agency's
regulatory
responsibility
have
to
be
immunized
to
allow
the
agency
to
do
its
task.
and
that
extends
a
little
bit
further
than
the
permission
standard
that
the
government
has
given.
and
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
would
think
it
does.
i
would
think
the
nasd
case
would
come
out
the
other
way
under
the
standard
the
sg
is
using
today.
but
we
think
we
win
under
the
inextricably
intertwined
standard,
because
all
of
this
conduct
is
closely
connected
to
what
is
permissible.
there's
a
very
fine
line
between
what
is
forbidden
and
what
is
permitted.
they
can
ask
about
future
market
prices.
they
can
give
the
ipos
to
their
best
customers,
but
they
can't
solicit
a
transaction
in
the
immediate
aftermarket
while
the
ipo
is
still--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
would
win
under
either
of
these
standards.
but
what
we
advocate
is
dismissal
with
prejudice,
which
is
the
relief
the
court
gave
in
the
nasd
case,
and
not
a
shapeless
remand
of
the
case
for
further
pleading.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
interference
would
overhang
the
market.
the
interference
would
affect
the
sec's
ability
to
lay
down
the
standards
and
encourage
conduct
going
up
to
the
line
of
prohibition.
and
the
remedy
that
the
court
approved
in
nasd
is
exactly
appropriate
here,
dismissal
with
prejudice.
these
plaintiffs
did
not
even
seek
to
amend
their
complaints
in
the
lower
courts.
under
second
circuit
law,
they've
waived
their
right
to
seek
an
amendment.
so
we,
in
sum,
urge
the
court
to
stick
with
its
own
standards
in
nasd
and
gordon.
the
standards
are
not
broken.
they
don't
need
to
be
fixed.
nobody
has
pointed
to
any
changed
circumstances
that
would
warrant
a
change
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
those
decisions
require
dismissal
with
prejudice.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
key
question
in
this
litigation
is
who's
going
to
design
what
a
tie-in
is
and
who's
going
to
decide
what
constitutes
unreasonable
compensation.
the
plaintiffs
say
quite
overtly
in
their
briefs
these
issues
can't
be
left
in
the
hands
of
the
sec.
well,
congress
put
these
issues
in
the
hands
of
the
sec.
there
are
three
separate
provisions
that
give
the
sec
power
to
define
what
is
forbidden
manipulation,
what
is
a
forbidden
tie-in,
and
what
is
excessive
compensation.
the
sec
this
court
has
said
is
an
agency
that
congress
had
considerable
confidence
in
in
the
gordon
case
and
that
confidence
is
well
justified
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
our
test
is
the
one
the
court
laid
down
in
those
two
cases:
is
there
active
supervision
or
is
there
pervasive
regulation?
if
the
answer
is
yes
to
either
of
those,
you
ask,
is
there
a
potential
conflict,
and
if
so
immunity
applies
and
the
complaint
has
to
be
dismissed.
and
this
is
true
whether
you're
talking
about
one
ipo
or
an
agreement
that
cuts
across
several
ipos,
because
even
in
the
multiple
ipo
situation
the
jury
would
still
have
to
decide,
was
that
a
tie-in
or
was
it
something
innocent;
was
it
unreasonable
compensation
or
was
it
something
that
was
proper?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
same
circumstances
were
presented
very
similar
to
the
nasd
in
the
invemed
case.
they
had
a
three-week
trial,
17
experts,
and
they
concluded
that
those
charges
were
quite
permissible
considering
the
whole
range
of
services
that
were
given.
now,
if
this
occurred
with
concerted
action
the
sec
has
power
to
deal
with
concerted
action.
congress
said
that
they
could
deal
with
multiple
party
manipulations.
they
have
many
cases
where
they
proceeded
against
multiple
parties.
in
the
nasd
case
the
claim
was
that
there
was
a
horizontal
conspiracy
involving
many
brokers
and
many
underwriters,
it
was
industrywide,
it
went
on
for
years
and
years.
and
the
government
argued
there
it
was
improper,
it
was
contrary
to
the
sec's
policies
this.
this
court
held
squarely
that
that
is
within
the
sec's
power
to
regulate
and
if
something
of
that
sort
is
occurring
the
sec
can
deal
with
it.
the
test
there
wasn't
whether
it
was
connected
to
something
that
was
permissible.
the
test
was
whether
it
was
connected
to
the
sec's
regulatory
responsibilities
and
the
sec
could
deal
with
that
sort
of
concerted
action
on
an
industrywide
basis.
now,
mr.
lovell
has
argued
that
the
conduct
has
always
been
forbidden.
he
labels
it
that
way.
there
are
many
case
from
this
court
that
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
holding
that
that
labeling
does
not
defeat
immunity
because
it's
always
possible
to
characterize
conduct
in
that
fashion.
but
the
agency
has
to
apply
its
expertise
to
decide
what
is
forbidden
and
to
change
its
rules
over
time,
which
the
sec
is
now
doing.
and
it
has
to
be
able
to
prevent,
deterring
conduct
that
comes
up
to
the
line
of
prohibition.
here
that
conduct
is
essential
to
protect
investors
and
to
protect
issuers.
the
markets
couldn't
function
efficiently
if
underwriters
could
not
engage
freely
in
the
kinds
of
conversations
that
get
twisted
in
this
litigation
into
something
characterized
as
tie-ins.
now,
there
are
310
private
suits
now
pending
under
the
securities
laws
brought
by
many
of
these
same
lawyers,
making
the
same
claims
of
concerted
action
to
manipulate
the
stock
market.
those
suits
are
subject
to
a
panoply
of
safeguards
that
congress
has
prescribed,
including
single
damages,
restrictions
on
class
action
abuse,
serious
loss
causation
requirements.
the
only
purpose
for
stretching
the
antitrust
laws
here
is
to
evade
all
of
the
safeguards
that
congress
has
passed,
each
and
every
one
of
them.
we
think
nasd
and
gordon
are
very
important
in
preventing
that
kind
of
a
pleading
tactic.
and
of
course,
when
counsel
talks
about
concerted
action
and
manipulating
the
stock
market,
what
did
congress
pass
the
'34
act
for
if
it
wasn't
that?
there
were
extensive
hearings
about
concerted
manipulation
involving
pools
and
groups
that
were
manipulating
the
market.
that's
why
there
are
several
anti-manipulation
provisions
in
the
'34
act
that
give
power
to
define
the
misconduct
and
to
deal
with
it
effectively.
and
this
is
the
toughest
cop
in
washington,
the
sec.
they're
perfectly
capable
of
dealing
with
this.

stephen

shapiro
we
thank

court.
