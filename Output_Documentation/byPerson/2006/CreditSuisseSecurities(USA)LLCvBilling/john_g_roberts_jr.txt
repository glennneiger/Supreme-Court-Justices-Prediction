chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
05-1157,
credit
suisse
securities
versus
billing,
et
al.--
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
shapiro,
you're
doing
a
good
job
of
defending
the
sec's
interests
but
your
position
goes
considerably
beyond
their
position
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
might,
but
they
haven't
yet.
a
couple
of
times
you've
used
this
phrase
cutting
across
ipos.
are
you
saying
there
should
be
an
absolute
immunity
from
antitrust
prosecution
within
a
single
ipo?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
lovell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
about
extending
antitrust
immunity
to
a
single
ipo?
in
other
words,
what's
wrong
with
that?
that's
where
the
sec's
regulation
seems
to
be
most
pervasive,
and
what
you
can
do
in
the
context
of
an
ipo
if
your
allegations
cut
across
ipos
that
might
be
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
you
talking
about
when
you
say
a
horizontal
agreement?
are
you
talking
about
a
group
of
underwriters
in
the
context
of
a
single
ipo?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
grasp
the
difference
between
the
single
ipo
and
multiple.
so
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
they
all
agree
in
the
context
of
a
single
ipo,
let's
make
sure
everyone's
going
to
hold
the
stock
for
a
month,
and
you
say
no
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
same
underwriters
get
together
the
next
month,
they've
got
a
different
ipo
and
they
say,
you
know,
let's
do
the
same
thing
we
did
last
time
because
seemed
to
work
well
in
terms
of
the
issuance
and
the
capital
formation.
all
of
a
sudden
that's
an
antitrust
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
test
is
it
has
to
be
prohibited
by
the
securities
laws?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
say
to
the...
sort
of
stepping
back
from
the
trees
to
the
forest,
to
the
general
suggestion
that
congress
has
been
tightening
up
the
requirements
for
private
securities
litigation
over
the
past
few
years;
and
you're
bringing
this
now
as
antitrust
claims
as
a
way
to
circumvent
congress's
regulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
problem...
the
problem
is
that,
of
course,
these
people
are
to
some
extent
under
the
securities
laws
in
the
business
of
fixing
prices.
they
get
together
as
a
syndicate,
a
syndicate,
and
say
well,
you
have
to
figure
out
what
price
we're
going
to
charge
for
this
initial
public
offering.
it
looks,
if
you
didn't
understand
the
context,
it
would
look
an
awful
lot
like
an
antitrust
violation.
and
the
problem
is,
i
guess,
that...
that
when
you
take
that
type
of
evidence,
the
type
of
evidence
you're
going
to
be
relying
on
to
show
that
there's
price
fixing,
it
is
exactly
what
the
sec
wants
the
people
to
do.
they
want
them
to
get
together.
they
want
them
to
agree
on
an
appropriate
ipo
price
that's
going
to
contribute
to
capital
formation
and
everything
else.
and
how
do
you
at,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage,
how
is
a
district
court
supposed
to
say
well,
this
is
the
bad
price
fixing,
this
isn't
the
good
price
fixing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
did
they
applaud
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sec
which
is
the
agency
charged
with
supervising
those
markets,
thinks
otherwise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
don't
think
these,
the
antitrust
actions
are
good
for
the
securities
markets.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lovell.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
