doesn't,
doesn't
the
statute
specifically
provide
for...
for
exactly
this
possibility?
doesn't
both
the
'33
and
the
'34
act
have
a
saving
other
remedies
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it...
were
those
two
clauses
expressly
limited
to
state
law
remedies?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
they
have
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
none
of
the
claims
includes
an
antitrust
claim
on
its
face.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
particular
difference
between
supporting
the
price
and
rigging
the
aftermarket?
i
mean,
how
do
we
tell
that
at
the
12(b)(6)?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
haven't
had
this
problem
focus
before,
and
isn't
primary
jurisdiction
the
most
efficient
answer
to
the
problem
that
we've
got?
in
other
words,
isn't
it
time
to
do
something
different?
