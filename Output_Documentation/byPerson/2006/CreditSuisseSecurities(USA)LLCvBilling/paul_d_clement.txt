mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
has
responsibility
for
enforcing
both
the
securities
laws
through
the
sec
and
the
antitrust
laws
through
the
justice
department
and
the
ftc.
it
thus
has
a
critical
interest
in
ensuring
that
these
laws
can
be
reconciled
in
a
manner
that
gives
effect
to
both,
and
completely
ousts
neither.
any
effort
to
try
to
reconcile
those
laws
in
the
specific
context
of
the
underwriting
of
ipos
has
to
begin
with
an
understanding
of
the
particular
regulatory
context
and
scheme.
the
sec
obviously
carefully
regulates
both
the
registration
and
the
underwriting
process
for
individual
ipos.
there
are
two
aspects
of
that
regulatory
regime
that
are
particularly
important:
first,
the
approval
for
all
sorts
of
collaborative
conduct
that
is
the
hallmark
of
the
underwriting
syndicate.
and
second,
the
very
fine
nature
of
the
distinctions
that
the
sec
draws
between
permissible
book
building
activity
and
impermissible
market
manipulation.
and
in
that
regulatory
context,
the
kind
of
collaborative
conduct
that
would
in
many
other
contexts
raise
yellow
or
red
flags
of
an
antitrust
violation
is
innocuous,
because
it's
a
hallmark
of
the
underwriting
process.
equally
important,
the
sec
does
make
certain
conduct
like
tie-ins
and
laddering
unlawful,
but
very
closely
related
conduct
is
not
only
permissible,
but
is
considered
beneficial
to
the
capital
formation
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
might,
justice
stevens.
the
prohibitions
on
laddering
and
tie-ins
are
not
just
disclosure
provisions.
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
if
these
kind
of
things
were
disclosed,
they
probably
wouldn't
happen.
so
it's
a
little
hard
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
may
be
true,
but
the
way
the
regulation
approaches
that
conduct
is
a
little
bit
more
of
a
prophylactic
approach.
it's
not
just
a
disclosure
approach,
and
it
does
say
that
there's
conduct
that
is
forbidden.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
just
how
fine
the
lines
that
are
drawn
here
become,
because,
to
give
you
a
real
world
example,
the
guidance
document
that's
at
page
216a
of
the
petition
appendix
makes
clear
that
it
is
permissible
for
the
lead
underwriter,
when
talking
to
customers,
to
gauge
their
interest
at
various
price
points
in
the
initial
offering.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
if
you
were
looking
at
a
challenge
that
took
place
solely
within
the
context
of
a
single
ipo,
it
would
probably
be
so
difficult
that
i
think
we
would
concede
that
you
can't
practically
separate
the
two.
what
i
think
is
important
from
the
standpoint
of
the
justice
department
and
its
antitrust
responsibilities
is
you
don't
want
to
sweep
an
immunity
so
broad
that
it
would,
say,
give
cover
to
a
conspiracy
that
cut
across
ipos,
and
was
an
effort
to
fix
commission
rates,
or
to
make
territorial
agreements,
or
exclude
a
rival
investment
bank
from
the
underwriting
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
you
could
certainly
perform
this
test
and
make
the
test
protect
conduct
sufficient
to
protect
against
that
threat.
we
are
certainly
sensitive
to
the
threat
that
a
regulatory
agency
is
trying
to
draw
a
fine
line
between
two
closely
related
areas
of
conduct.
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
enforce
that
line
as
a
practical
matter
if
the
regulated
community
knows
that
the
consequence
of
having
a
foot
fault
in
crossing
that
line
will
be
treble
damages
in
a
class
action
suit.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
caution
against
adopting
some
sort
of
broad
immunity
that
would
preclude,
say,
the
justice
department
from
investigating
and
prosecuting
an
antitrust
conspiracy
that
cut
across--
ipos.
and
of
course,
the
congress
has
addressed
the
problem
of
treble
damages
directly
in
a
number
of
areas.
and
i
suppose,
if
they
were
to
address
the
area
in
the
antitrust
context,
they
might
draw
a
distinction
between
private
treble
damages
suits
and
government
enforcement
efforts.
now,
that's
a
little
hard
to
do--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean,
i
would
warn
you
off
of
sort
of
saying
absolutely
no.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
it
is
going
to
be...
i
mean,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
ready
example
of
where
an
allegation
that
is
specific
to
an
internal
single
ipo
would
really
be
practically
inseparable.
so
i
think
the
role
of
the
antitrust
laws
will
largely
be
in
allegations
that
cut
across
ipos.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
suppose
it's
possible,
justice
breyer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
if
you
draw
a
distinction
between
intraipo
allegations
and
interipo
allegations,
you
go
a
long
way
towards
doing
it.
and
i
should
note,
that's
basically
the
line
this
court
drew
in
nasd.
if
you
look
particularly
at
the
part
of
the
decision
that
deals
with
count
1
of
the
government's
complaint,
that
was
a
horizontal
allegation.
and
it
was
all
in
the
context
of
vertical
agreements
that
were
specific
to
a
particular
mutual
fund.
and
in
that
context,
this
court
said
that
with
respect
to
the
horizontal
agreement,
there's
nothing
in
the
sec
regulations
that
specifically
addresses
that,
but
the
sec
specifically
blesses
the
vertical
agreements,
so
we're
going
to
give
additional
immunity
to
that
horizontal
agreement.
that
same
page,
page
733
of
the
opinion,
they
say,
what
we
don't
have
before
us
is
an
allegation
by
the
government
that
there
is
a
scheme
here
to
reduce
competition
between
mutual
funds.
there
is
no
allegation
that
they
were
trying
to
cut
down,
there
was
an
agreement
that
would
cut
down
competition
between
fidelity
and
wellington,
for
example.
it
was
all
in
the
context
of
individual
funds
and
retarding
the
secondary
market
for
individual
funds.
the
language
the
court
used
on
page
733
of
that
opinion
seems
to
us
a
perfectly
reasonable
test.
the
court
said,
quote:
sec
had
prohibited
in
the
vertical
context
and
what
was
sought
to
be
gone
after
in
the
context
of
the
horizontal
restraints,
those
are
too
closely
related.
i
don't
think
that
test
has
caused
the
undue
confusion.
and
i
think
what
it
does
it
makes
a
reasonable
balance
between
a
ruling
that
on
the
one
hand
preserves
a
great
deal
of
immunity,
but
on
the
other
hand
doesn't
give
a
kind
of
blanket
immunity
that
would
basically
completely
oust
the
antitrust
laws.
and
i
think
that's
the
balance
we
hope
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
this
court
could
do
one
of
two
things.
i
mean,
the
petitioners
for
their
part
have
pointed
to
in
footnote
6
of
the
blue
briefs,
to
a
variety
of
second
circuit
precedents
about
the
standards
for
repleading.
perhaps
the
easiest
course
for
this
court
would
be
to
just
vacate
and
let
the
second
circuit
apply
its
own
law
of
repleading.
that
would
be
one
option.
the
other
option
would
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
would
have
no
objection
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
would
say,
you
know,
you
might
say
that,
particularly
based
on
the
guidance
this
court
gives
in
this
case
and
the
guidance
this
court
gives
perhaps
in
the
twombley
case,
that
it
might
be
fair
to
let
the
plaintiffs
have
a
crack
at
making
a
new
complaint
in
this
area.
oh
the
other
hand,
as
i
say,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
just
allowing
the
second
circuit
to
sort
it
out
based
on
second
circuit
pleading
law.
i
think
the
important
thing
from
our
perspective--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
frame
that
complaint.
i
think
if
it
focused
on
inter-ipo
allegations
and,
contrary
to
this
complaint,
paragraph
42
of
this
complaint,
actually
alleges
that
there
were
a
variety
of
different
mechanisms
that
were
used,
that
doesn't
sound
like
what
you
would
expect
from
a
disagreement
that
cut
across
ipos.
you'd
expect
uniform
conduct
to
be
alleged.
and
if
there
was
that
sort
of
conduct
and
it
was
alleged
to
violate
both
regulatory
regimes
in
a
clear
way,
then
maybe
it
could
go
forward.
thank
you.
