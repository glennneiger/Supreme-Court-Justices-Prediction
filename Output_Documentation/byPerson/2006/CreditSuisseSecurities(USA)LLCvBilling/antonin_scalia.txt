justice
antonin
scalia
did
it,
did
it
specifically
state
that,
or
is
it
that
or
just
the
principle
that
all
federal
agencies
have
an
obligation
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
even
think
we
mentioned
them.
did
we
mention
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
mention
them
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
we
just
forgot.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
primary
jurisdiction
were
a
cure-all,
there
would
never
be
any
cases
in
which
the
regulatory
scheme
did
not
displace
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
epa
is
not
a
hands-on
regulatory
agency
the
way
the
sec
is.
it
has
not
been
given
an
entire
industry
to
regulate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
government
says
that's
fine
where
the
regulations
have
been
issued,
and
where
they...
where
they
render
the
action
here
lawful.
there's
no...
no
problemo.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government's
willing,
in
other
words,
to
give
the
sec
carte
blanche.
whatever
you
say
is
lawful
is
lawful
that
won't
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
extends
a
lot
further,
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
could
decide
that
way.
we
could
say,
we
don't
have
to
decide
what
the
standard
is,
even
if
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
as
the
government
does,
you
would
win,
you
would
be
happy--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
problem
you
address
has
been
a
problem
of
strike
suits.
and
it
is
the
problem
that
congress
addressed
in
its
legislation.
shake
downs.
it
just
is
less
expensive
to
pay
off
the
suitor
than
it
is
to
litigate
it
to
a
final
conclusion,
where
that
conclusion
is
highly
uncertain.
and
i
don't
see
how
your...
your
solution
of
inextricably
intertwined,
where
there's
a
penalty
of
treble
damages
if
you
guess
wrong
about
that
line,
i
don't
see
how
that's
going
to
stop
the
strike
suits
any
more
than
the
current
situation
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
want
to
roll
the
dice
on
whether
something
is
inextricably
intertwined,
with
treble
damages
at
the
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
saying
that
that's
this
case.
he's
just
saying
that
it's
so
easy
to
make
allegations
that
action
which
was
perfectly
legitimate
amounted
to
action
that
was
illegitimate.
and
that
question
ultimately
gets
thrown
into
the
laps
of
the
jury;
and
if
the
jury
comes
out
the
wrong
way,
you
get
hit
with
treble
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
don't
understand
why
the
sec
could
not...
they
can
make
rules
for
a
single
ipo;
it
seems
to
me
they
can
make
rules
for
coordination
of
ipo.
why
can't
they
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
chosen
not
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you...
you
could
regard
the
activity
of
laddering
and
of
making
a
book
on
a
stock
when
the...
in
the
case
of
a
single
offering.
you
could...
you
could
look
upon
that
as,
as
an
attempt
to
raise
the
price.
that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
an
attempt
to
make
sure
there's
going
to
be
a
high
enough
price
for
the
stock
so
that
it
won't
flop
once
it's
out
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
and
you're
saying
they
did
this
just...
not
in
the
context
of
just
single
ipos,
but
that
they
agreed
across
ipos
that
they
would
all
do
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
the
customer
being
the
issuer?
justice
antonin
scalia
they'd
have
to
pay
the
premium.
justice
antonin
scalia
look,
the
question
isn't
whether
it
satisfies
it.
the
question
is
whether
you
can
get
rid
of
this
suit
at
the
outset
or
do
you
have
to
go
through
enormously
expensive
discovery,
which...
which
isn't
worth
the
candle.
justice
antonin
scalia
--discovery?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you've
answered
his
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
you've
said
that
the
two
were
different.
his
question
was
how
can
you
tell
at
the
outset,
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage,
the
difference
between
those
two
things
that
you've
mentioned?
sure
they're
different
but...
but
the
evidence
that
is
only
evidence
of
the
one
also
looks
like
evidence
of
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wasn't
the
sec's
position
below,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
justice
department
was
on
one
side,
the
sec
was
on
the
other.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
looks
to
me
like
they
split
the
baby
up
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
happens
with
this
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
context
of
an
antitrust
suit.
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
antitrust
suit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
primary
jurisdiction,
would
we
refer
it
to
the
sec
and
accept
the
sec's
fact
determinations
and
then
instruct
the
jury
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
is
really
the
factual
determination
that
is
the
hang-up,
that
you
don't
want
things
that
are
innocent
and
that
the
sec
would
know
are
innocent
to
be
taken
as
evidence
of
guilty
by
the
jury.
so
you
really
haven't
accomplished
a
whole
lot
if
you
just
send
it
over
to
the
sec
for
rulings
on
the
law
as
opposed
to
rulings
on
whether
this
particular
conduct
violated
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
test,
mr.
shapiro?
