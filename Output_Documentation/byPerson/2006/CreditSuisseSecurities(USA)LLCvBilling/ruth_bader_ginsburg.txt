how
about
in
this
case
did
the
sec
examine
that
question
at
all
in
this
case?
and
did
it
take
any
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
should
we,
we
weigh...
congress
is
asking
with
respect
to
securities,
private
securities
litigation,
congress
looked
at
that
and
thought
some
restraint
had
to
be
placed
on
private
actions,
but
it
didn't
do
anything
with
respect
to
antitrust
private
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
many
situations
in
which
a
particular
industry
is
subject
to
regulators
and
they
sometimes
conflict?
like
epa
and
osha?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
on
remand
in
this
very
case
based
on
your
theory?
you
are
not
adopting
the
district
judge's
position
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
outright.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
when
it
goes
back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why,
if
this
is
a
sprawling
complaint
and
if
the
problem
is
that
it
says
too
much
or
too
vaguely?
a
district
court
doesn't
have
to
leave
the
pleader
to
its
own
devices.
it
can
have
a
pretrial
conference
and
say,
now
let's
get
this
whole
thing
in
order,
and
it's
not
that
the
pleader
is
left
alone
to
do
what
he
or
she
will.
but
in
complex
cases
like
this,
the
district
judge
will
often
assert
control
from
the
beginning
and
not
leave
the
parties
to
do
what
they
want.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would,
what
would
a
satisfactory
complaint
for
this
party
look
like?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
have
a
chance
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
about
primary
jurisdiction.
let's
get
the
sec's
views
first
of
whether
there
is
any
interference
with
securities
law
enforcement.
