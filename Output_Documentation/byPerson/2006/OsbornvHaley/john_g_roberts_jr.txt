chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
osborn
v.
haley.
mr.
grant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
actual
statutory
language
refers
to
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
at
the
time
of
the
incident,
and
so
a
certification
based
on
the
view
that
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
incident,
he
was
acting
entirely
within
his
scope
would
seem
to
be
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
how
is
it...
i
mean,
that
line
is
awfully
difficult
to
draw.
you
assert
he
didn't
do
it
versus
something
else.
but
it's
easy,
let's
say
it's
an
assault
case
and
the
person
says,
you
hit
me,
and
the
person
says,
well,
it
was
entirely
an
accident;
i
was
gesticulating
with
my
hand
so
it
wasn't,
wouldn't
have
met
the
requirements
for
the
tort.
now,
are
they
denying
the
incident
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not
just
a
characterization.
if
it's
something
that
has,
for
example,
a
mental
element,
the
plaintiff
can
assert,
you
did
that
with
malice
aforethought
and
the
defendant
can
say,
no,
i
didn't.
now,
is
that
a
characterization
or
is
that
a
denial
of
the
incident?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
for
deciding
whether
removal...
i
thought
the
statute
says
that
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive
with
respect
to
removal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
the
certification
is
conclusive
with
respect
to
scope
of
employment
for
purposes
of
removal
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
conclusive,
if
you're
going
to
have
judicial
review
that
is
going
to
address
the
question
of
removal
as
opposed
to
the
validity
of
the
certification
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
it's
only
conclusive
if
it's
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
at
least
considerable
tension
with
1447(d),
though,
and
2679(d)(2),
in
that
that
specifically
says
that
for
purposes
of
removal,
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive.
and
it
doesn't,
if
you
look
at
2679,
it
suggests,
you'd
think
that
case
would
proceed
in
federal
court
rather
than
be
immediately
remanded
without
the
availability
of
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
different
type
of
jurisdictional
statute
in
that
there
is
concern
on
congress's
part
here
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
the
adjudication
of
whether
something
is
within
the
scope
of
a
federal
employee's
duty.
it's
not
inconceivable,
but
it
would
seem
illogical
to
specifically
provide
for
review
of
that
determination
but
then
have
that
review
take
place
in
state
court
rather
than
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
grant.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
the
attorney
general
certifies
and
removes
a
case
in
a
criminal
case,
a
case
clearly
not
within
the
statute?
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
on
the
procedure,
he
follows
the
procedure
meticulously;
it's
just
wrong.
it's
a
criminal
case.
the
statute
says
he
can
do
it
in
a
civil
case.
on
the
other
hand
the
statute
also
says
that
his
certification
is
conclusive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
this
one
is
a
civil
one
and
that's
a
criminal,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
how
broad
your
argument
that
this
is
not
subject
to
further
review
goes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
i
thought
your
analogy
to
willingham
was
a
strong
one
until
you
go
back
and
read
the
statute.
willingham
is
a
very
different
statutory
predicate.
it's
acting
under
color
of
law.
this
is
much
more
specific.
at
the
time
of
the
incident,
he
was
acting
within
his
scope,
so
i'm
not
sure
the
analogy
holds
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
yet
that
would
be
a
good
argument
if
the
statute
said
the
attorney
general
can
certify
that
the
employee
did
not
do
anything
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
it's
phrased
in
the
affirmative.
he
has
to
certify
that
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
happens
in
a
case
where
the
certification
is
clearly
wrong?
i
mean,
you
get
into
a
fight
with
your
neighbor.
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
employment
at
all
but
the
attorney
general
certifies
that
it
does.
you
know:
"they
are
always
thinking
about
your
cases.
"
"you
must
have
been
thinking
about
it
at
the
time.
"
that
certification
goes
into
the
district
court.
the
district
court
looks
at
it
and
says
this
is
ridiculous,
throws
it
out,
then
that
state
law
assault
case
proceeds
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
wouldn't
have
discretion
in
that
case,
though,
because
the
statute
says
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
maybe
your
answer,
one
alternative
answer,
would
have
been
that
you
can't
remand
the
case
but
you
can
still
dismiss
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
still
be
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it's
conclusive
for
purposes
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
jurisdiction
wouldn't
depend
on
that.
justice
ginsburg's
point
that
there's
more
than
pendent
jurisdiction
here
i
take
it
is
because
these
are
not
separate
state
claims
appended
to
what
you
thought
was
a
federal
claim.
this
is
the
same
claim
that
you
initially
thought
was
a
federal
claim
and
then
it
turned
into
a
purely
state
law
claim,
and
that
may
be
analyzed
quite
differently
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
grant,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
was
nothing
expressed
about
thermtron,
and
yet
we
recognized
an
exception
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
grant.
the
case
is
submitted.
