mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
westfall
act
congress
provided
an
absolute
immunity
for
federal
employees
for
acts
taken
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
and
it
went
further
and
provided
that
when
the
attorney
general
certifies
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
at
the
time
of
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arose,
that
that
issue
of
federal
immunity
is
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
court.
it
is
the
attorney
general's
assertion
of
this
federal
defense
of
immunity
that
satisfies
article
iii
just
as
the
employee's
own
assertion
of
immunity
satisfies
article
iii
under
the
federal
officer
removal
statute
and
just
as
a,
in
other
circumstances
a
plaintiff's
assertion
of
a
claim
under
federal
law
satisfies
article
iii.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
that
the,
the...
that
would
probably
be
a
defect
in
removal
procedure
rather
than
a
jurisdictional
defect
but
even
if
it
is--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor
even
if
that
is
a
case
that
would
be
removed
without
jurisdiction,
that
case
is
quite
different
from
this
case
because
this
case--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
issue
that
is
not
subject
to
further
review
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
is
the
attorney
general's
certification
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
scope.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
that
the
attorney
general's
certification
that
it
is
a
civil
action
is
conclusive
but
only
the
attorney
general's
certification
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
scope
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
that's
the
essential
element
of
the
federal
defense
and
that's
what
satisfies
article
iii
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact,
this
court
in
the
willingham
case
recognized
that
an
employee
could
assert
a
claim
of
federal
immunity
even
though
he
was
also
at
the
same
time
denying
that
he
caused
any
harm
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well
if
anything
the
language
of
the
westfall
act
is
broader
because
as
your
honor
emphasized
earlier,
the
statute,
the
westfall
act
provides
that
the
attorney
general
is
to
certify
that
at
the
time
of
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arose
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope.
so
arguably
the
necessary
question
is
what
was
the
employee
doing
at
the
time.
the
federal
officer
removal
statute
is
somewhat
narrower
because
it
requires
that
the
claim
arise
out
of
the,
the
acts
taken
under
color
of
office.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
and
that's
what
the
attorney
general
did
here,
certified
that
mr.
haley
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
at
the
time
of
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arose.
and
as
several--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--you
are
correct
that
our
view
is
that
yes,
the
attorney
general
can
certify
in
that
case.
the
issue
is
really
one
along
a
continuum
as
i
think
your
honor
has
recognized.
of
on,
on
the
one
extreme,
one
might
say
that
the
attorney
general
must
accept
all
of
the
plaintiff's
allegations
as
true.
and,
and
i
don't
think
that
anybody
here
is
arguing
that.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
was
the
position
of
the
district
court,
although
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
is
now
advocating
that
view.
and
that
view
would
certainly
be
inconsistent;
it
would
create
the
anomaly
that
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
certify
scope
and
to
assert
the
immunity
on
behalf
of
the
employee
would
be
narrower
than
the
employee's
own
authority
to
assert
the
immunity,
because
again
going
back
to
the
willingham
case,
the
court
never
asked
whether
it
would
be
within
the
scope
of
employment
for
the
prison
officials
to
have
maliciously
tortured
the
prisoner;
rather
the
defense
was
we
didn't
harm
the
prisoner
but
anything
that
happened
between
us
and
the
prisoner
happened
within
the
scope
of
our
employment.
and
so
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
certify
has
to
be
at
least
as
broad
as
that
in
our
view.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the...
i
think
i
do.
in
our
view--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--in
our
view,
it
would
be
anomalous
that
the,
that
the
more
innocent
employee
would
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
westfall
act,
and
if
i
could
use
a
more
simple--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
could
be
the
end
of
it.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
reality
is
much
murkier
than
the
black
or
white
and
even
in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
poses,
it
is
quite
possible
that
as
the
case
progresses,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
attempt
to
introduce
evidence
that
is
much
more
ambiguous
as
to
whether
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
or
not.
if
i
could
use
a
simple
example
of
assault.
if
the,
if
a
supervisor
is
dressing
down
her
employee
for,
for
inadequate
work,
the
employee
then
sues
the
supervisor
alleging
that
she
assaulted
her,
shaking
her
fist
right
under
her
nose,
threatening
harm
to
her.
even
if
that
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
employment,
the
employee
might
say...
the
supervisor
rather
might
say,
i
never
raised
my
hand
at
all.
i
raised
my
voice
certainly
but
i
never
raised
my
hand.
a
third
party
witness
may
say
well
i
saw
the
supervisor
wag
her
finger
at
the
employee
but
not
in
a
threatening
fashion.
now--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
if
the
employee--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--if
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
employment
when
she
wagged
a
finger,
then
a
fortiori
she
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
her
employment
when
she
didn't
raise
her
hand
at
all.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
but
congress
made,
established
an
absolute
immunity
where
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment,
and
petitioner
agrees
that
scope
of
employment
is
the
essential
question
for
immunity.
so
if
in
my
hypothetical
the
supervisor
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
her
employment
when
she
dressed
down,
raising
her
voice
but
not
raising
her
fist,
her,
her
subordinate,
then
she
is
protected
by
the
westfall
act
from
a
claim
arising
out
of
the
context
of
that
employment.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
your
honor,
the
congress
enacted
the
westfall
act
against
the
presumption
of
regularity
of
federal
officials
and
that
is
of
course
what
this
court
has
often
said
as
well,
and
so
i
don't
think
we
should
construe
the
statute
on
the
presumption
that
the
attorney
general
would,
would
certify
ridiculous
cases.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
that
would
mean
that
the
district
court
did
not
on
the
merits
ultimately
uphold
the
defense
of
immunity,
but
as
the
court
said
in
mesa,
the
merits
of
the
immunity
defense
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
lamagno
was
about
whether
the
certification
was
reviewable.
your
honor
is
also
correct
about
the
facts
of
that
case.
one
of
the
points
of
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs
there
was
whether
mr.
lamagno
was
drunk
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
and,
and
the
attorney
general
certified
on
his
understanding
that
mr.
lamagno
was
not
drunk.
and
that
was
upheld
by
the
district
court
on
remand
after
some
discovery
and
summary
judgment
type
litigation.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
it
can
be
reviewed
and
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
not
conclusive
for
purposes
of
the
substitution.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
the
court's
removal
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
happened.
but,
and
in
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
procedure
for
what
happens
upon
the
district
court's
review
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
westfall
act,
neither
is
the
review
itself
in
particular.
but
the,
the
employee--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
uniform
view
of
the
lower
courts
is
that
when
the
certification
is
overturned,
the
effect
is
to
resubstitute
the
employee
as
the
defendant
and
it
proceeds
in
federal
court
as
a
pendent
claim.
the
attorney
general's
assertion
of
the
defense
of
immunity
which
we
presume
to
be
colorable
because
we
presume
regularity
by
the
attorney
general,
confers
article
iii
jurisdiction
on
the
courts,
even
though
it
may
ultimately
on
the
merits
be
rejected.
this
court
held
in
the
carnegie-mellon
case
that
the
district
courts
have
discretion
whether
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
pendent
claims
once
the
federal
question
has
been
resolved.
if
the
courts
have
discretion
to
exercise
that
pendent
jurisdiction,
then
certainly
congress
can
instruct
them
to
exercise
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
congress
has
removed
the
discretion
in
this
class
of
cases
and
says
that
the
courts
must
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
the,
perhaps,
perhaps
that's
so.
certainly
carnegie-mellon--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--by
its
text,
the
statute
speaks
to
removal
and
that
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
but
i
think--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but
the...
as
the
court
held
in
carnegie-mellon,
a
remand
of
pendent
claims
after
the
federal
issue
has
been
resolved
is
not
a
remand
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
1447(c).
rather,
it
is
a
discretionary
remand
under
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction,
and
so--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--and
it
would
be
reviewable.
that's
why...
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
district
court's
order
here
is
reviewable,
because
it
is
not
an
order
of
remand
authorized
by
1447(c)
because,
first
of
all,
congress
has
instructed
the
courts
that
they
are
not
to
remand.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
district
court--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
your
honor,
because
here
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
the
face
of
the
district
court's
order
to
understand
what
it
was
doing.
the
court
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
question
that
was
properly
brought
before
it
by
the
attorney
general's
certification
and
this
court's
decision
in
lamagno.
after
resolving
that,
the
district
court
said,
having
concluded
that
the
united
states
is
not
a
proper
party
to
this
case,
the
court
must
now
determine
whether
or
not
it
has
jurisdiction,
and
it
also
said
that
the
absence
of
the
u.s.
as
a
party
to
the
case
destroys
the
court's
jurisdiction.
so
it's
evident
that
the
court
understood
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
that
it
was
a
subsequent
event
that
deprived
it.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
congress's
intent.
the...
in
all
of
the
government--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that
is
true.
but
i
think
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
the
same
as
this
court,
all
the
members
of
this
court,
recognized
in
lamagno.
in
lamagno,
even
the
dissenters,
the
plurality,
all
acknowledged
what
congress
intended
by
the
"conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal"
language
was
to
prevent
the
shuttling
back
and
forth
of
the
case.
once
it
was
removed,
it
was
to
stay
in
federal
court.
that
was
what
congress
intended.
and
one
reason--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
by
pendent
jurisdiction
what,
what
i
meant
to
convey
was
that
it
is
within
the
court's
article
iii
jurisdiction
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
state
law
claims
that
were
pendent
to
a
federal
claim.
under
this
court's
judicially
developed
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction,
that
is
discretionary
with
the
court.
but
if
it
is
discretionary
with
the
court,
then
certainly
congress
can
mandate
that
the
court
exercise
that
jurisdiction
and
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
article
iii.
but
another
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
the
case
to
remain
in
federal
court
even
if
the
certification
is
overturned
is,
as
we've
alluded
to
before,
the
development
of
the
case
subsequent
to
the
certification
substitution
decision
may,
may
illustrate
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
does
indeed
assert
facts
that
were
within
the
scope
of
employment.
the
court
would
at
the
very--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no.
the
case
is
i
think
not
distinguishable
from
removals
under
the
federal
officer
removal
statute,
where
congress
has
indicated
that
it
is
the
federal
defense
that
confers
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
federal
claim.
then,
the
ultimate
merits
of
the
federal
defense
are
irrelevant
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
and
the
court--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
(d)(3).
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
that
your
honor's
point
illustrates
that
this
issue
of
federal
law
is
one
that
congress
has
mandated
be
resolved
at
the
outset
by
the
judge,
and
if
the
employee
petitions
for
certification
over
the
attorney
general's
objection
the
statute
allows
the
attorney
general
to
remove
the
petition
to
federal
court
and
the
statute
states
that
the
district
court
shall
find
and
certify
whether
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
he
can,
you
are
correct.
it
is
at
the
option
of
the
attorney
general
under
(d)(3)
to
remove
the
case
at
that
point
so
that
the
review
of
his
noncertification
happens
in
federal
court.
(d)(3),
in
stark
contrast
to
(d)(2),
provides
that
if
the
district
court
holds
that
the
attorney
general
was
correct
that
the
employee
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
the
case
is
to
be
remanded
to
state
court.
so
the
presence
of
the
remand--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the...
i
think
what
that
illustrates
is
that
congress
wanted
the
issue
of
immunity
resolved
at
the
outset
of
the
case
by
the
court.
and
one
reason
that
that
is
so
essential
under
the
westfall
act
ftca
scheme
is
that
if
the
immunity...
if
the
scope
of
employment
issue
is
resolved
in
favor
of
the
employee,
that
has
many,
many
consequences,
including
that
the
united
states
is
the
proper
defendant,
exclusive
jurisdiction
lies
in
the
federal
court,
the
case
must
be
dismissed
until
an
administrative
claim
is
filed
and
that
avenue
is
exhausted.
all
of
these
procedural
and
substantive
defenses
come
into
play
depending
on
how
the
scope
of
employment
issue
is
resolved.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
justice
breyer's
question,
though,
had
to
do
with
the
procedure
at
the
certification
review
stage.
that
is
to
be
done
by
the
district
court
sitting
without
jury
and
that's
because
under
the
statute
the
attorney
general's
certification
has
the
legal
effect
of
making
the
united
states
the
defendant.
the
united
states...
the
action
shall
be
deemed
an
action
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
shall
be
substituted,
and
that
is
true
unless
and
until
the
certification
is
overturned.
and
there
is
of
course
no
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
against
the
united
states.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i'll
respond
to
anything,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
the
remand
was
not
one
of
the
remands
authorized
by
1447(c)--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--not
just
that
it
was
erroneous.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
and
we
have
two
arguments
that
both
the
issues,
substitution
and
remand,
are
appealable.
one
is
a
very
specific
one
and
that
is
that
congress
has
categorically
taken
this
kind
of
remand
outside
the
court's
authority
under
1447(c)
by
specifically
prohibiting
remand
at
all
in
2679(d)(2),
and
that
argument
of
course
would
not
have
relevance,
i
don't
think,
much
beyond
this
case.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
congress
can
exempt
a
certain
class
of
orders
from
the
scope
of
47(c)
and
(d)
without
cross-referencing
those
provisions.
in
the
rice
case,
the
court
said
that
that
specific
removal
provision
did
not
purport
to
impair
or
restrict
the
application
of
the
then
equivalents
of
747(c)
and
(d).
but
clearly
2679(d)(2)
does
purport
to
impair
the
authority
to
remand
by
making
the
certification
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal.
so
with
that
as
our
narrowest
argument--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but
when
congress
specifically
prohibited
the
courts
from
remanding
a
case
under
2679(d)(2)
it
certainly
did
not
mean
to
protect
a
court
that
ignored
that
mandate
from
review.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
if
i
may,
your
honor?
i
think,
two
things:
one,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
congress
categorically
prohibiting
a
certain
kind
of
remand,
and
saying
that
a
remand
was
simply
erroneous.
and
secondly,
that
that
argument
would
not
go
to
our
argument
that
under
waco,
at
the
very
least,
the
order
on
substitution
is
appealable,
because
it
is
separate
and
independent
from
remand.
