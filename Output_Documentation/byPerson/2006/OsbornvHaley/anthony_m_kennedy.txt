justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
point,
and
it
concerns
me
as
well,
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
say
that
during
the
time
the
event
occurred,
i.e.,
the
firing,
he
was
on
duty
and
he
refrained
from
committing
any
unlawful
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
question
is
what
the
district
court
should
examine,
and
the
statute
talks
about
the
incident
out
of
which
the
claim
arose.
so
that
necessarily
requires
the
government
to
look
at
the
complaint,
see
the
incident
out
of
which
this
claim
arises,
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
true,
and
to
certify
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
"out
of
which
the
claim
arose.
"
it
seems
to
me
is
of
some
importance.
but
the
dissenting
judges
in
the
first
circuit
case,
wood,
didn't
think
it
was
important.
i'm
not
sure
they
were
right
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
the
attorney
general
doesn't
certify
and
it
goes
to
state
court?
i
take
it
one
of
the
concerns
we
have
here
is
that
there
will
be
a
deprivation
of
jury
trial
if
the
certification
is
wrong
and
if
it's
in
federal
court.
suppose
that
there
is
a
denial
of
certification.
then
under
(d)(3)--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
employee
can
ask
for
a
certification
decision.
i
take
it
that's
a
federal
law
defense
that
the,
or
a
federal
law
point,
that
the
state
court
must
hear
and
so
now
we're
back
in
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
still
don't
have
a
jury
trial
and
if
that's
so
i'm
not
sure
if
that
helps
you
or
helps
the
petitioner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
my
case
i
guess
i
don't
think
it
ever
gets
to
district
court
because
there's
no
certification,
but
then
the
employee
can
ask
the
state
court
to
have
a
bench
trial
on
the
scope
of
employment.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
point
is
i
suppose
the
government
can
just
say,
we're
not
going
to
make
the
certification
and
we're
not
going
to
remove.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
state
court
still
has
to
have
the
bench
trial
on
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
if
that
helps.
it
seems
to
me
that
might
be
an
argument
for
limiting
the
inquiry
just
so
that
we
can
avoid
having
bench
trials
in
almost
every
case.
