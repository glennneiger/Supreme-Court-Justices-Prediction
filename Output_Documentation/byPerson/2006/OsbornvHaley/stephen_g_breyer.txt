justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
your
answer,
can
i
go
back
to
the
other
main
issue
for
a
second?
i
would
have
thought
that
your
case,
unfortunately
for
you
in
my
mind,
is
the
classic
case
where
there
should
be
jurisdiction
because
the
ag
is
supposed
to
say
look,
i
don't
think
anything
happened,
okay?
so
he
was
doing
his
job
all
day.
but
if
something
did
happen,
i'll
tell
you
what,
it
was
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
and
apparently,
that's
just
what
they
did
say
here.
and
then
it
got
mixed
up
in
the
courts
below.
in
other
words,
if
he
made
some
phone
calls
and
even
if
he
mentioned
the
employee,
even
if
he
said
something
improper,
it
was
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
which
is
just
what
they
said.
so
because
of
that,
it
seems
to
me
this
makes
a
lot
of
complexity
out
of
nothing.
now
you
explain
what
your
answer
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
district
court
he
didn't
say,
if
something
happened
here,
it
was
in
the
scope
of
his
employment?
i
thought
he
had.
maybe
he
hadn't.
i
thought
he
had,
but
i'll
ask
him
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
district
court
i
thought
he
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
was
there
first,
but
you
can
argue
in
the
defense
alternative,
i
think
nothing
happened.
but
if
the
plaintiff
can
convince
a
jury
otherwise,
fine,
but
then
what
they
can
convince
him
of
is
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
now
did
that
happen
in
the
district
court,
that
they
said
something
like
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
can't
they
do
that,
which
is
just
what
wood
says
they
can
do,
if
anybody,
you
know,
thinks
that's
valid?
but
the...
what's
the
problem
then?
because
i
would
have
thought
that
the
reason
this
case
appears
difficult
is
because
yours
is
a
case
where
the
ag
should
be
able
to
come
in
and
remove
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
wrong
in
that,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
wood
issue
was
the
issue
of
where
if
anything
happened,
of
course
it's
outside
the
scope.
it's
like
one
employee
shoots
another,
you
know.
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
scope
of
employment
there,
it's
plainly
outside.
and
of
course,
this
act,
in
my
view
then,
then,
was
that
this
is
not
an
act
that
allows
the
ag
to
defend
that
kind
of
thing.
but
if
it's
arguable
at
least
that
something
happened,
if
it
happened
at
all
it
was
within
the
scope
of
employment,
the
ag
can
defend
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem
with...
there
should
be
a
problem
with
what
i
say
from
your
point
of
view,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
you're
saying
they
have
abandoned
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the
issue
then.
and
what
i...
is
my,
my
question
for
you
is
this,
let's
imagine
not
this
case,
which
as
i
said
i
think
is
too
complicated
and
probably
is
one
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
defend,
but
suppose
it's
an
assault
like
wood's,
a
sexual
assault
and
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
that
if
it
happened
it
was
outside
the
scope
of
employment,
everybody
concedes
it
but
government.
and
the
government's
position
is,
nothing
happened.
all
right?
nothing
happened.
you
say
government,
would
you
like
to
argue
that
if
something
happened,
and
they
may
be
able
to
prove
something,
something
like
a
movement?
no,
we
agree
there
was
nothing
like
that,
we
agree
nothing
like
that
happened;
we
are
not
going
to
defend
on
any
scope
of
employment
ground.
all
we
are
arguing
is
that
ordinary
work
went
on
and
that
was
within
the
scope
of
employment.
now,
does
this
act
cover
it
or
not?
your
view
is
yes
and
you
read,
you
know
i
thought
it
was
a
close
question
but
you
read
what
i
thought
the
other
way
in
wood,
though
it
was
obviously
a
close
question.
so
what
is
your
basic
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
basic
point
i
think
in
wood
is
this.
i'm
the
district
judge.
and
the
government,
you
come
in
and
argue
in
the
alternative.
nothing
happened,
but
if
it
did
happen
it
was
within
the
scope
of
employment
and
they
say
there
is
no
possibility.
you'd
say,
plaintiff,
i
want
to
know
here
if
there
is
a
reasonable
chance,
maybe
any
chance,
that
a
jury
could
find
that
something
went
on
here
that
was
within
the
scope
of
employment
that
shouldn't
have.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
the
defendant
wins
either
because
of
summary
judgment
or
because...
no,
sorry.
i've
gotten
lost
in
what
i
said.
do
you
follow
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
good,
i'm
glad
that
someone
did.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
talking
really
about
practicality
of
it.
i
don't
think
you
can
give
me
a
case
that
is
going
to
be
hard
for
me
as
a
district
judge
to
decide
because
i'm
going
to
ask
you,
the
government,
to
tell
me
if
anything
went
on
here
that
might
have
been
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
i
look
at
what
you're
saying;
if
you
say
no,
if
you
say
no
you
can't
defend
it.
if
you
say
yes,
you
can
defend
it
and
that's
going
to
be
the
end
of
it
as
long
as
your
view
is
based
on
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
long
as
a
jury
could
find
that
there
is
a
view
of
the
record
such
that
the
plaintiff
might
prove
something
wrong
that
it
was
within
the
scope
of
employment,
such
as
finger
wagging
that
hits
her
forehead,
for
example,
you
can
defend
it.
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
problem
is
if
you
admit
that
you
can't
prove
anything
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
a
fortiori,
for
the
reason
that
congress
wrote
this
statute
not
to
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
call
in
the
government
to
defend
him
no
matter
what
he
did.
the
reason
that
congress
wrote
the
statute
was
to
repeal
the
westfall
case,
which
was
a
question
of
the
scope
of
immunity,
which
was
the
question
of
the
scope
of
government
responsibility
to
take
away
that
limited
determination
in
westfall.
that
was
the
only
point.
congress
could
have
written
a
statute
the
way.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
that's
the
strongest
argument
i
thought
the
other
way
initially,
that
suppose
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
on
a
frolic
of
his
own.
that
you
resolve
in
a
bench
trial.
if
the
answer
he
was,
okay,
it
stays
in
the
federal
court
anyway.
i
understand
that.
but
if
you're
going
to
take
your
position
whether,
say,
it's
a
sexual
assault
as
it
was
in
wood
and
the
question
is
well,
was
there
a
sexual
assault
or
not,
and
if
there
was
it's
clearly
outside
of
the
scope
of
employment,
well,
then
you're
going
to
have
all
these
things
resolved
in
a
bench
trial
and
actually
it's
supposed
to
normally
be
before
a
jury,
for
example.
