justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
come
out
the
way
you
urge
us
to
come
out.
why
would
it
make
any
sense
to
give
a
federal
employee
the
benefit
of
trial
in
federal
court
when
he
committed
the
act,
and
then
you
debate
about
whether
it
was,
whether
there
was
liability
or
not,
and
yet
deprive
him
of
the
benefit
of
a
federal
court
when
he
denies
that
he
did
anything
at
all?
why
would
you
want
one
set
of
cases
to
remain
in
the
state
court
and
the
other
set
of
cases
to
go
to
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
what
we're
debating,
whether
the
line
is
there
or
not,
and
as
you've
seen
from
the
discussion,
there
is
at
least
some
ambiguity
in
it.
there
being
ambiguity,
why
should
we
find
a
line
that
doesn't
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
can
happen
when
in
fact
the
certification
of
the
attorney
general
turns
out
to
be
wrong
and
there
isn't
any
immunity.
still,
the
whole
thing
is
going
to
be
tried
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grant,
these
items
we've
been
discussing
are
perhaps
the
more
important
features
of
the
case.
but
your
argument
in
your
brief
didn't
begin
with
those.
it
began
with
the
assertion
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court's
remand
order
at
all.
i
take
it
you're
not
abandoning
that,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
was
it
first
in
your
brief
and
not
first
in
your
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
would
have
been
even
if,
even
if
the
remand
was
improper,
even
if
it
is
the
case
that,
what
is
it,
(d)(2)
envisions
that
the
suit
remain
in
the
federal
court.
nonetheless,
if
there
is
an
erroneous
remand,
it
is
still
a
remand
that
is
covered
by
the
prohibition
of
review.
i
mean,
we
said
in
other
cases
that
even
when
the
remand
is
wrong,
the
remand
is
not
reviewable.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
if
the
district
court
finds
that
in
fact
the
defendant
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
the
united
states
is
eliminated
as
the
defendant
and
the
individual
employee
is
resubstituted?
justice
antonin
scalia
where,
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
united
states
should
remain
the
party
defendant
and
the
united
states
should
pay
which
would
be
the,
you
know,
the
price
of
the
attorney
general's
certification.
he
should
be
careful
what
he
certifies.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's,
that's
what
the
district
court
said
it
was,
though,
isn't
it?
didn't
it...
wasn't
the
district
court
remanding
for
lack
of
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
want
us
to
review
the,
the
assertion
of
the
district
court
that
it
was
remanding
for,
i
mean
that
would
mean
every
case
would,
would
be
reviewable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grant,
could
i
come
back
for...
i'm
sorry.
i
have
the
wrong
counsel.
mr.
hallward-driemeier--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
your
response
to
the
application
of
1447(d)?
you
say
that
it
does
not
apply
where
it's
apparent
on
the
face
that
the
remand
is
improper?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
somebody
always
be
able
to
bring
an
appeal
asserting
that
to
be
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
wouldn't
that
destroy
the
whole
purpose
of
1447(d),
which
is
to
stop
this
ping-pong?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
response
to
that
is
that
our
opinions
show
that
even
an
erroneous
remand
is
nonetheless
governed
by
1447(d).
there
are
a
lot
of
erroneous
remands
and
this
would
just
be,
just
be
another
one.
