justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
the
denial
of
an
element
of
the
claim?
there's
no
recovery
for
assault
if
the
mental
element
is
what
the
chief
justice
just
described
in
his
hypo,
and
if
in
fact
that
is
an
element
of
the
claim
how
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
that
and
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
any
act
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
asking
about
certain
cases.
i
just
want
to
know
analytically
how
you
do
it
or
how
you
think
we're
supposed
to
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
this
case
the
immunity
defense
is,
number
one,
as
you
said,
the
government
forthrightly
said
at
the
beginning
right
in
terms
of
the
statute
that
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
secondarily,
as
you
said,
the
government
in
effect
elaborated
on
that
and
said
the
reason
he
was
not
acting
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment
is
that
these
acts
which
would
have
been
outside
scope
didn't
happen.
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
claim
in
the
chief
justice's
hypo
that
there
was
no
intent
to
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
claim
upon
which
the
immunity
depends.
the
immunity
is
claimed...
the
immunity
claimed
here
is
that
at
the
time
in
question
he
was
not
acting
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment.
the
reason
he
was
not
acting
outside
the
scope
was
that
he
didn't
do
what
they
say
he
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
it
be
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal
jurisdiction,
but
still
leave
the
district
court
with
discretion
to
remand
on
the
grounds
that,
although
it
had
removal
jurisdiction,
in
fact
the
premise
of
that
removal
jurisdiction
was
wrong,
and
it
would
therefore
remand,
in
effect,
because
the
only
claim
it
had
before
it
was
the
equivalent
of
a
pendent
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that
case
it
would
be
reviewable.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
there
are
two
claims,
one
claim
is
raised
by
the
defense,
and
if
you
look
at
that
claim
which
is
by
definition
federal,
then
it's
fair
to
look
at
the
original
state
claim
by
analogy
as
a
pendent
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
problem,
and
maybe
i'm
missing,
and
i
may
be
missing
something
here,
but
isn't
the
problem
with
your
argument
is
that
the
statute
didn't
come
out
and
say
you
can't
remand.
the
statute
said,
for
purposes
of
removal,
the
certification
is
conclusive,
and
that
allows
for
the
kind
of
dichotomy
that
you
and
i
were
talking
with
before.
a
court
can
say
look,
i
know
that
i
have
article
iii
jurisdiction
here,
but
in
point
of
fact
i
am,
i
am
remanding
because
what
you
and
i
are
calling
here
the
pendent
claim
does
not
support
any
of
the
government's
theory.
if
that's
the
case,
then
under
1447(d),
there
could
be
a
review
of
it
because
it
was
not
a
jurisdictional
ruling.
but
if
on
the
contrary,
the
judge
said,
as
i
think
the
judge
said
here,
i
am
remanding
because
based
on
this
analysis,
i
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
i.e.,
the
judge
went
against
the
statute
saying
that
jurisdiction
is
conclusive.
that
is
an
erroneous
jurisdictional
ruling,
and
as
justice
scalia
said,
we
have
said
over
and
over
again,
however
erroneous
it
may
be,
it
is
not
reviewable.
