justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
grant,
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
why
is
the
discovery
in
the
federal
system
any
less
valuable
in
the
state
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
only
summary
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
the
removal
was
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
hypo
a
little
earlier.
could
the
district
judge
at
that
point
dismiss
the
case
without
prejudice
to
refiling
in
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
court
having
jurisdiction
to
dispose
of
the
case.
