justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
this
case,
if
mr.
haley
had
said,
i
had
some
conversations
with
the
private
employer
and
the
plaintiff's
name
was
mentioned
during
the
conversations,
but
i
never
told
them
to
discharge
her,
would
this,
would
that
be
something...
would
your
argument
apply
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
position
is
that
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive...
is
not
conclusive
in
those
situations
in
which
the
attorney
general
doesn't
draw
the
line
properly
between
an
event
denying
answer
and
an
event
characterizing
answer?
whenever
the
attorney
general
is
wrong
on
that
very
nuanced
decision
in
some
instances,
then
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
not
conclusive?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
here
not
only,
not
only
does
it
say
that
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
conclusive
for
purposes
of
removal,
but
there
is
no
mention
about
remand
in
relation
to
a
case
that
is
removed
after
the
attorney
general's
certification.
whereas
by
contrast,
where
the
attorney
general
doesn't
certify
and
the
case
is
removed,
the
statute
does
address
the
issue
of
remand.
so
if
you
put
those
two
things
together,
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
these
cases
that
are
removed
on
the
attorney
general's
certification
to
be
remanded?
