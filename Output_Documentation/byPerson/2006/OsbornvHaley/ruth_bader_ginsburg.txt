justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
a
wholly
state
law
claim
if
the
principal
matter
is
whether
this
federal
employee
is
immune
from
suit?
that's
the
threshold
question
that
has
to
be
answered.
it's
determined
wholly
by
federal
law,
so
you
must
get
through
that
federal
law
gateway
before
you
can
go
any
place
else
in
the
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
it's
not
it
never
happened
as
though
the
federal
employee
was
off
in
hong
kong.
he
was
there
on
the
premises.
he
is
claiming
that
whatever
he
did
was
within
the
scope
of
his
authority.
it
seems
like
it's
a
question
of
phraseology
that
you're
dealing
with.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it?
i
mean,
that's...
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
argument,
mr.
grant,
is
that
in
life
things
are
often
not,
it
happened
or
it
didn't
happen.
there
is
a
middle
ground,
which
is
this
officer
is
saying,
i
was
there
at
the
relevant
time
or
place
and
when
i
was
there
everything
that
i
did
was
within
the
scope
of
my
employment,
i
didn't
do
anything
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
my
employment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose,
mr.
grant,
that
the
district
court
had
said,
i'm
going
to
deny
the
substitution
of
the
united
states
as
the
defendant,
but
i
realize
that
this
is
a
debatable
question,
so
i'm
not
going
to
order
a
remand
until
the
defendant
and
the
united
states
have
had
a
chance
to
challenge
my
initial
ruling
that
i
deny
the
substitution
of
the
united
states.
suppose
that
it
had
happened
that
way?
would
you
have
any
right
to
get
back
in
the
state
court?
wouldn't
that
properly
go
to
a
court
of
appeals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
that
happened,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
united
states
should
have
been
substituted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
position
of
the
district
court,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
what
about
the,
lamagno,
where
the
question
was,
was
the
employee
working
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
or
was
he
off
on
a
frolic
of
his
own?
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
question
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you.
the
certification,
if
it
were
wrong,
the
attorney
general
said
what
he
was
doing
was
within
the
scope
of
employment
and
turned
out
he
was
on
a
drunken
binge
with
his
friends
and
they
got
in
his
car
and
killed
someone.
if
that
certification
within
the
scope
was
wrong
and
instead
he
is
on
a
frolic
of
his
own,
then
the
united
states
isn't
substituted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
that
case
was
about,
was
the
certification
reviewable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
said
that
that
could
be
reviewed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it's
more
than
pendent
jurisdiction,
because
pendent
jurisdiction
leaves
it
up
to
the
federal
court
to
either
retain
the
state
claim
or
send
it
back.
so
this
is...
what
you're
suggesting
is
something
other
than
pendent
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
so?
if
the
employee
is
resubstituted,
it's
going
on
now,
the
united
states
is
not
a
party,
just
the
federal
employee,
but
it's
staying
in
federal
court
under
this
pendent
jurisdiction-like
theory,
wouldn't
either
party
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
defense
of,
i
was
on
the
job
and
everything
i
did
on
the
job
was
within
the
scope
of
my
employment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
left
with
this
question
justice
scalia
raised.
if
it's
ambiguous,
an
employee
says
i
did
everything
within
the
scope
of
my
employment,
i
did
nothing
improper.
they
allege
i
did
something
improper.
i
didn't.
i
was
a
faithful
servant.
the
negligent
employee
will
be
allowed
the
federal
forum,
but
the
one
who
was
a
loyal,
careful
employee
has
to
be
in
the
state
court.
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
an
employee
who
said
i
never
did
one
thing
that
was
inconsistent
with
my
federal
employment.

ruth
bader
ginsburg

have
to
announce

we

procedural

questions
regarding

pat
osborn
sued
federal
employee
barry
haley
in
the
state
court.
osborn
alleged
that
haley
tortiously
interfered
with
her
employment
with
a
private
contractor
that
he
conspired
to
cause
how
wrongful
discharge
and
that

about

were

the

the

thereupon
remove
the

has
divided
on
the
question
whether

is

when
the
federal
employee
asserts
and
the
attorney

concludes
that
the

the

in

and
the
attorney

deny
the
occurrence
of

on

the

accordingly,
the

entered
an
order
that
rejected

denied
the

motion
to
substitute
the
united

the
court
of

for
the
sixth

determine
that
westfall

certification
was
proper
so
the
government
denied
the
alleged
wrongdoing
and
therefore
vacated
the
district

order.
we
affirm

we
considered
first
whether
