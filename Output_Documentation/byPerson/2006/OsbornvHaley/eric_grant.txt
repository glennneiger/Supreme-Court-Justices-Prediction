mr.
eric
grant
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
the
westfall
act
in
a
way
that
unfairly
deprives
tort
plaintiffs
of
the
most
basic
procedural
protections
routinely
afforded
in
both
federal
and
state
courts.
that
misinterpretation
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
text
and
history
of
the
statute,
the
nature
and
operation
of
official
immunity
or
the
jurisdictional
limitations
of
article
iii.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
this
state
law
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts
where
it
rightfully
belongs.
in
the
alternative,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
vacated
for
lack
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
prior
to
the
westfall
act,
courts
considered
whether,
assuming
the
alleged
acts
occurred,
the
federal
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
in
westfall
v.
erwin,
this
court
added
the
additional
requirement
that
the
acts
be
undertaken
with
a
discretionary
function,
but
invited
congress
to
address
the
issue.
in
responding
with
the
westfall
act,
congress
did
not
change
the
basic
rule
that
scope
of
employment
sets
the
line
for
immunity.
indeed,
congress
confirmed
that
rule.
in
particular,
congress
gave
no
hint
that
it
was
radically
rewriting
the
rules
to
direct
federal
district
courts
to
determine
the
merits
of
wholly
state
law
claims
in
some
sort
of
unprecedented
summary
proceeding.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
that
is
true
in
perhaps
a
majority
of
westfall
act
cases,
but
in
cases
like
this
and
a
significant
and
recurring
subset
of
cases
there
is
no
federal
law
question
because
scope
of
employment
simply
is
not
at
issue.
what
the
government
does
in
those
subset
of
cases
is
merely
to
assert
the
defense
of
he
didn't
do
it
or
it
never
happened.
mr.
eric
grant
with
respect,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
case,
certainly
in
this
case
and
in
others.
the
government
has
conceded
that
if
respondent
barry
haley
acted
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
he
was
acting
outside
the
course
and
scope
of
his
federal
employment.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
there
may
be
cases
where
even
if
the
acts
occurred,
they
were
within
the
course
and
scope
of
the
federal
employment.
but
in
the
case
like
this,
as
in
wood
versus
united
states,
as
in
melo
v.
hafer
in
the
third
circuit,
the
government
concedes,
because
the
law
and
the
facts
require
the
government
and
the
employee
to
concede,
that
if
the
alleged
acts
took
place
they
were
necessarily
outside
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
on
its
face
the
certification
in
this
case,
as
in
others,
tracks
the
statutory
language.
but
when
the
government's
position
was
examined
in
the
district
court,
it
became
apparent
that
the
government's
essential
defense,
in
fact
supported
by
two
declarations,
including
the
declaration
of
respondent
haley,
was
that
he
simply
did
not
do
the
acts
alleged.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor--
mr.
eric
grant
--your
honor,
this
court
has
consistently
made
a
distinction
between
immunity
and
the
merits.
starting
in
cases
like
mitchell
versus
forsyth
in
1985
and
continuing
through
cases
like
richardson
versus
mcknight
in
1997,
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
immunity
is
different
from
a
defense
on
the
merits.
it's
different
from
a
defense
of
he
didn't
do
it
or
it
never
happened.
and
i
would
say
that,
although
the
time
of
the
incident
is
important,
that
is
only
one
of
several
factors
certainly
under
kentucky
law
in
determining
whether
something
happened
within
the
course
and
scope
of
employment.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
the
court
in
wood
v.
united
states
took
account
of
the
possibilities
of
artful
pleading
and
would
allow
the
government
to
challenge
the
characterization
of
the
incident.
mr.
eric
grant
i
believe
that's
a
characterization,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
grant
there
are,
your
honor,
certain
cases
in
which--
mr.
eric
grant
--there
are
cases
in
which
the
merits
and
the
immunity
defense
overlap
and
in
those
cases
the
district
courts
are
fully
empowered
to
make
factual
findings.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
because
a
claim
of,
that
the
alleged
act
did
not
occur,
that
he
didn't
do
it,
is
not
a
claim
of
immunity.
again,
this--
mr.
eric
grant
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry
if
i
have
the
same
answer
to
the
question,
but
again,
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
consistently
distinguished
between
defenses,
so
to
speak,
on
the
merits,
a
claim
that
the
alleged
act
did
not
occur,
that
one
of
the
elements
of
the
state
law
claim
is
not
met.
mr.
eric
grant
it
would
apply,
your
honor,
if,
if
that
factual
determination
were
relevant
to
scope
of
employment
under
the
applicable
law,
namely
the
agency
law
of
kentucky.
mr.
eric
grant
there
are
cases
in
which
there
is
a
middle
ground,
your
honor.
but
this
case
is
not
one
of
them,
and
there
is
certainly
a
distinct
and
recurring
subset
of
cases,
like
wood
and
melo
and
kimbro,
where
it
is
conceded
on
the
facts
and
the
law
that
if
the
actions
occurred,
they
occurred
outside
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
it's
congress
that
set
the
line
at
scope
of
employment.
mr.
eric
grant
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
line
does
make
sense
because
if
the
government's
view
is
adopted
and
the
view
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
merits
of
the
wholly
state
law
claim
will
be
resolved
in
federal
court
and
resolved
in
a
procedural
context
that
denies
a
tort
plaintiff
the
right
to
discovery,
that
denies
the
tort
plaintiff
a
right
to
the
normal
evidentiary
presumptions
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
denies
that
tort
plaintiff
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
in
that
situation,
the
merits
will
at
least
be
tried
under
the
normal
provisions
for
discovery
and
evidentiary
presumptions,
even
if
it
does
ultimately
proceed
against
the
united
states.
mr.
eric
grant
because
what
the
government
advocates
here,
as
i
think
most
starkly
illustrated
by
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
melo
v.
hafer
is
some
sort
of
summary
proceeding
that
takes
place
before
the
normal
processes
of
federal
litigation.
after
all,
it's
the
government's
position
that
this
employee
is
immune.
mr.
eric
grant
it's
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
scope
of
employment,
but
the
government's
interpretation
of
that
phrase
encompasses
essentially
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
eric
grant
it
is
conclusive,
your
honor,
in
those
cases
that
truly
do
implicate
scope
of
employment.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
the
certification
was
essentially
to
raise
the
he
didn't
do
it
or
it
never
happened
defense.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
it's
conclusive
where
it
satisfies
the
definition
in
the
statute.
what
is
conclusive
in
the
final
sentence
of
paragraph
(d)(2)
of
section
2679
is
this
certification,
and
this
certification
of
course
is
the
one
referred
to
earlier
in
that
paragraph.
mr.
eric
grant
no,
your
honor.
it's
only,
it
can
be
conclusive
right
or
wrong,
but
it's
only
conclusive
if
it
satisfies
the
statutory
definition,
being
about
scope
of
employment,
not
about
the
merits.
in
this
case,
for
example,
there
never
will
be,
never
could
be
a
true
scope
of
employment
determination,
the
government
having
conceded
it.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
that,
that
could
certainly
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
discretionary
appeal
procedure
in
section
1292(b),
or
perhaps
by
mandamus.
mr.
eric
grant
that
would...
that
would
on
its
merits
restrict
the
district
court
from
remanding,
but
of
course
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
enter
an
order
of
remand
based
on
its
interpretation
of
section
2679.
mr.
eric
grant
the
short
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general's
certification
is
not
conclusive
where
it
does
not
satisfy
the
statutory
definition,
where
it
is
not
a
certification
that
truly
implicates
scope
of
employment.
we
have
tried
to
draw
the
distinction
between
an
unauthorized
or
improper
certification,
one
that
doesn't
meet
the
statutory
definition,
and
a
certification
as,
as
the
court
in
aliota
versus
graham
said
was
wrong
or
erroneous
on
its
merits,
so
to
speak,
on
the
facts,
on
the
law,
of
state
agency
law.
mr.
eric
grant
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
grant
it
was
first
in
my
brief
because
this
court
ordered
me
to
brief
and
address
it,
and
i
was
happy
to
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
did
lack
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
this
court
has
made
clear
as
recently
as
the
kircher
opinion
last
term
that
section
1447(d)
means
what
it
says.
and
in
this
case,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
remanding
the
case
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed,
and
1447(d),
of
course,
bars
review
of
that
order
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
on
the
merits
of
the
interpretation
of
2679(d)(2),
we
tried
to
explain
why
conclusive
does
not
operate
in
a
case
like
this,
but
i
think
the
important
point
for
jurisdiction
is
that
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
even
if
a
district
court
misinterprets
a
jurisdictional
statute,
that
review
is
nonetheless
barred
by
section
1447(d).
mr.
eric
grant
well,
your
honor,
congress
obviously
knows
how
to
make
exceptions
to
section
1447(d).
i
believe
it
was
footnote
eight
of
this
court's
opinion
in
kircher
that
cited
a
number
of
examples.
the
government
in
its
brief
relied
on
12
u.s.c.
section
1441(a),
and
that
statute
which
involved
the
resolution
trust
corporation
specifically
refers
to
appeal
and
remand.
and
so
what
this
court
has
said
is,
the
bar
of
section
1447(d),
which
has
been
around
for
more
than
a
century,
is
not
to
be
ignored
unless
there
is
a
clear
statutory
command
that
makes
an
exception.
mr.
eric
grant
no,
your
honor.
the
authority
to
remand
in
this
case
proceeds
from
subsection
c
of
section
1447.
as
this
court
has
said
in
various
cases,
including
the
international
primate
protection
league
case
in
1991,
when
a
federal
district
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
a
case,
a
party
attempting
to
remove
has
done
so
without
authority
to
do
so,
section
1447(c)
obliges
a
remand.
mr.
eric
grant
that
is
my
answer,
your
honor.
section
(d)(2)
goes,
gives
direction
to
district
courts,
but
section
1447(d)
gives
direction
to
appellate
courts.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
believe
the
attorney
general
said
just
the
opposite,
that--
mr.
eric
grant
--your
honor--
mr.
eric
grant
--the
attorney
general's
submission,
the
government's
submission
in
the
district
court
was
that
nothing
happened.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
the
government
did
make
what
it
called
an
alternative
argument.
mr.
eric
grant
the
district
court,
the
very
same
district
court
that
the
government
so,
so
desperately
wants
to
review
the
facts
of
this
case,
said
that
given
mr.
haley's
declaration
under
penalty
of
perjury,
it
would
not
accept
that
alternative.
mr.
eric
grant
well,
the
government
did
not
appeal
that
point
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
fact--
mr.
eric
grant
--your
honor,
the
government--
mr.
eric
grant
--i
think
the
problem
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
the
government's
brief
at
the,
at
the
petition
stage
on
page
14
in
note
five
quotes
its
own
appellate
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
brief
says
the
memorandum
of
understanding
between
the
forest
service
and
the
private
respondent
showed
that
if
haley
did
cause
the
contractor
to
fire
osborn,
he
acted
outside
the
scope
of
his
employment.
and
the
court
of
appeals
quite
logically
took
that--
mr.
eric
grant
--they
have
your
honor
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
on
page
3a
of
the
petition
appendix.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
grant
thank
you.
as
to
jurisdiction,
congress
knows
how
to
make
an
exception
to
section
1447(d).
all
of
the
examples
cited
by
the
court
in
kircher,
and
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
specifically
referred,
used
the
terms
appeal
and
remand.
the
statute
here
contains
neither
of
those
terms.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
thermtron
was
a
case
where
the
district
court
did
not
even
purport
to
be
relying
on
one
of
the
grounds
enumerated
in
section
1447(c),
namely
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
district
court
explicitly
cited
both
that
statute
and
used
the
term
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
the
government
itself
is,
is
not
willing
to
go
behind
that.
on
the
merits,
the
government
has
argued
this
morning
that
the
westfall
act
provides
a
federal
forum
to
assert
a
federal
defense
of
immunity.
the
government
has
analogized
this
statute
to
section
1442(a),
which
allows
the
assertion
of
a
colorable
federal
defense,
but
the
defense
of,
he
didn't
do
it,
it
never
happened,
is
not
a
federal
defense.
it
is
not
a
defense
of
immunity.
mr.
eric
grant
in
certain
cases,
your
honor,
that
could
be
a
defense
of
immunity,
but
in
a
class
of
cases
identified
by
justice
breyer,
there
will
be
an
admission.
there
has
to
be
an
admission
under
the
facts
and
the
law,
that
even
if
the
alleged
acts
occurred,
it
was
outside
the
scope
of
employment.
in
that
case,
the
defense
is
purely
a
merits
defense.
and
i
think
for
this
court
to
say
otherwise
in
this
case
would
require
overruling,
or
being
contradictory
to
over
20
years
of
official
immunity
jurisprudence,
where
the
court
has
consistently
distinguished
between
immunity
defenses
and
defenses
on
the
merits,
where
certainly
the
lower
courts
have
taken
that
conceptual
distinction
and
said
a
defense
that
the
alleged
acts
did
not
occur
do
not
raise
an
immunity
defense.
and
so,
the
assertion
of
a
defense
in
that
case
on
the
merits
is
not
the
assertion
of
a
federal
defense.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
confer
federal
jurisdiction
under
article
iii.
it
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
a
statute,
of
the
statute,
which
uses
the
phrase
"scope
of
employment"
no
fewer
than
seven
times.
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
in
the
westfall
act
intended
to
change
the
normal
rules
that
purely
state
law
defenses
such
as
he
didn't
do
it
were
to
be
decided
in
a
federal
forum.
mr.
eric
grant
your
honor,
i
think
that's,
with
respect,
a
misunderstanding
of
how
the
statute
works.
the
employee
who
acts
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
whether
or
not
he
did
the
acts
alleged,
gets
immunity.
the
employee
who
acts
outside
of
the
scope
of
employment--
mr.
eric
grant
--that's
an
employee
who
should
win
on
the
merits
and
will
win
on
the
merits.
as
justice
kennedy
recognized,
there
are
certain
applications
that
allow
the
state
court
to
resolve
even
a
federal
defense.
we
should
trust
that
state
courts
will
resolve
state
law
defenses
in
a
manner
fair
to
their
own
citizens
as
well.
