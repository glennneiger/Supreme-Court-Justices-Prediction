justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
national
bank
set
up
its
mortgage
operations
as
a
division
or
as
a
department,
then
the
sole
regulator
would
be
occ,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's...
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
regulations.
i
think
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about
regulations
of
a
chartering
state.
this
subsidiary
was
set
up
under
the
law
of
a
state.
it
wasn't
michigan.
is
there...
is
anyone
contesting
that...
was
it
north
carolina?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they
have
to
meet
all
the
requirements
for
setting
up
a
corporation
and
having
meetings
and
all
that
that
north
carolina
requires
of
corporations
that
are
incorporated
in
that
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blanchard,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
perhaps
preliminary
to
what
you
are
launching
into?
my
understanding
was
that
you
did
not
question
the
occ's
regulatory
authority
over
a
unit
that
it
says
can
do
what
the
national
bank
itself
could
do
in
the
real
estate
business,
no
more,
no
less.
occ
regulation,
visitation,
all
the
rest,
occ's
regulations
validly
applied
to
this
subsidiary
that
has
been
set
up
in
north
carolina
and
is
operating
in
michigan;
is
that
right?
it
is
one
thing
for
you
to
say
we
have
the
authority
to
regulate.
are
you
saying
at
the
same
time
that
occ
is
out
of
the
picture
because
its
dual
regulation
conflicts
with
the
inevitable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah,
you're
saying,
you
started
to
say
they
can't
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too,
but
you're
saying
they
can
have
the
worst
of
all
possible
regulatory
worlds,
so
that
they've
got
two
equally
competent
regulators,
and
they
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
have...
one
thing
that
seems
concrete
and
clear
to
me...
correct
me
if
i
get
this
wrong...
michigan
is
kind
of
deferring
to
occ
in
its
primary
jurisdiction
sense.
it
says
customers,
if
you've
got
complaints
about
what
this
operating
subsidiary
is
doing,
you
go
first
to
the
occ;
and
then
if
we
think...
we,
michigan...
thinks
occ
has
not
given
you
an
adequate
response
to
your
complaint,
we
take
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
kind
of
a
reverse
supremacy.
where
it's
usually
the
feds
that
have
the
last
word,
but
here
you're
saying
michigan
has
decided
that
it
will
let
occ
go
first
and
michigan
will
be
kind
of
a
supervisor
for
the
adequacy
of
the
occ's
handling
of
the
consumer's
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
another
arrangement
where
the
federal
agency
goes
first
but
then
the
state
agency
has
authority
to
say
federal
agency,
you
didn't
deal
with
this
consumer
adequately,
so
we
will
take
over?
i
know
schemes
that
work
the
other
way
where
the
state
goes
first,
and
then
the
federal
authority,
but
do
you
know
another
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
the
primary
adjudicator,
decision-maker
would
be
the
federal
authority,
but
then
the
state
can
override
that
if
it
thinks
the
federal
authority
hasn't
done
an
adequate
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
action
an
inadequate
action?
michigan
is
saying
yeah,
the
federal
authority
can
do
with
respect
to
this
unit
just
what
it
would
do
to
a
national
bank
itself,
but
if
we
think
that
is
inadequate,
that
is
a
question
of
just
one
act
or
the
other,
but
if
the...
it
is
the
state
judging
the--
adequacy
of
a
particular
federal
response.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
practically,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
way
they
operated
when
they
were
just
a
corporation
as
before,
and
now
a
parent
and
sub?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
business
activities
of
national
banks
are
controlled
by
the
national
bank
act,
the
nba
and
regulations
adopted
there
under
by
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
occ.
the
nba
authorizes
national
banks
to
engage
in
real
estate
lending
subject
to
occ
regulation
under
the
act
only
occ
not
state
regulators
may
oversee
the
bank’s
conduct
of
its
business
and
inspect
the
bank’s
books
and
records.
the
question
in
dispute
does
a
national
bank’s
in
mortgage
lending
remain
outside
the
governance
of
state
licensing
and
auditing
agencies
when
the
lending
business
is
conducted
not
by
the
bank
itself
but
by
the
bank’s
operating
subsidiary.
operating
subsidiary
is
a
term
used
by
occ
to
describe
“an
entity
authorized
to
do
only
business
that
the
bank
itself
could
do.”
in
accord
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
have
considered
this
issue
we
hold
that
a
national
bank’s
mortgage
business
whether
conducted
by
the
bank
itself
or
through
the
bank’s
operating
subsidiary
is
subject
to
occ’s
superintendence
and
not
to
the
licensing,
reporting
and
visitorial
regimes
of
the
several
states
in
which
the
subsidiary
operate.
the
case
before
us
was
initiated
by
wachovia
bank
an
occ
chartered
national
bank
and
it’s
wholly
owned
north
carolina
chartered
subsidiary,
wachovia
mortgage.
a
company
engaged
in
real
estate
lending
in
michigan
and
elsewhere.
under
michigan
law
banks,
both
national
and
state
are
exempt
from
state
mortgage
lending
registration
prescriptions
but
the
exemption
does
not
extend
to
the
bank’s
subsidiaries.
michigan’s
office
of
insurance
and
financial
services
notified
wachovia
mortgage
that
it
could
not
engage
in
mortgage
lending
in
the
state
unless
it
complied
with
michigan’s
registration
requirements.
wachovia
mortgage
and
its
parent
responded
that
their
subsidiary
is
a
subject
exclusively
to
occ’s
licensing,
ordering
and
surveillance
regime.
to
settle
the
dispute
the
wachovia
company
sued
michigan’s
commissioner
linda
watters
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
prohibiting
watters
from
enforcing
michigan’s
registration
prescriptions
against
wachovia
mortgage
and
from
interfering
with
occ’s
exclusive
visitorial
authority.
the
federal
district
court
ruled
for
the
wachovia
plaintiff,
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
and
today
we
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment.
federally
chartered
banks
are
subject
to
state
laws
of
general
application
in
their
daily
business.
for
example,
state
contract
and
property
laws
but
when
state
prescriptions
significantly
impair
the
exercise
of
a
national
bank’s
federally
convert
authority
the
state's
regulations
must
give
way.
michigan’s
commission
acknowledges
that
the
state
could
not
subject
a
national
bank
to
visitorial
controls
but
argues
that
this
state’s
regulatory
regime
is
not
displaced
with
respect
to
national
bank’s
operating
subsidiaries,
we
disagree.
since
1966,
occ
has
recognized
that
national
banks
have
incidental
authority
under
the
nba
to
do
their
business
through
operating
subsidiaries.
just
as
duplicative
state
inspection
and
supervision
would
significantly
burden
mortgage
lending
by
a
national
bank
so
to
those
same
state
controls
would
interfere
with
that
same
activity
when
conducted
by
a
national
bank’s
operating
subsidiary.
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
nba’s
preemptive
reach
extends
only
to
the
national
bank
itself
rather
in
determining
whether
state
law
hampers
the
federally
permitted
activities
of
a
national
bank
the
court
has
focused
on
the
national
bank’s
powers
not
on
whether
those
powers
are
exercised
by
the
national
bank
itself
or
an
operating
subsidiary.
in
some
way
the
national
bank
engages
in
real
estate
lending
through
an
operating
subsidiary.
the
subsidiary
is
subject
only
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
as
those
that
would
govern
the
bank
itself.
the
state
law
in
this
case,
north
carolina
law,
governs
matter
pertaining
to
an
operating
subsidiaries
incorporation
state
regulators
cannot
interfere
with
the
business
of
banking
by
subjecting
national
banks
or
their
occ
licensed
operating
subsidiaries
to
rival
oversight
regimes.
we
reject
commissioner
watters’s
alternative
argument
based
on
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
because
regulation
of
national
bank
operations
is
congress’s
prerogative
under
the
commerce
and
necessary
and
proper
clauses.
the
tenth
amendment
holds
no
sway
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
has
field
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
joined.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
