well,
i
guess
we
can
ask
the
respondents.
but
is
it
your
understanding
that
respondents
take
the
position
that
the
state
has
no
control
at
all
over
whether
or
not
the
shares
have
been
properly
issued,
whether
or
not
certain
accounting
requirements
applicable
to
all
corporations
have
been
complied
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
say
that
there's
no
area
of
state
law
that
is
applicable
to
the
subsidiary
corporation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
could
understand
that
with
reference
to
just
the
amount
of
consumer
loans,
as
justice
scalia
was
talking
about.
but
just
to
see
if
the
corporation
has
a...
had...
had
a
meeting
that
year,
has
duly
elected
its
officers
under
state
law,
do
the
respondents
take
the
position
you
have
no
authority
to
visit
the
corporation
to
determine
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
seems
to
be
a
standard
preemption
case.
it's
not
as
broad
as
just
visitorial
powers
generally.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
do
some
subsidiaries
of
the...
of
a
national
bank
do
things
other
than
banking,
say
title
insurance
or
something
like
that?
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
record
where
the
occ
wants
to
displace
the
state
as
to
that.
this
is
just
a
standard
preemption
case.
when
the
occ
has
regulations
that
control,
then
the
state
has
no
authority
to
add
to
those
regulations
or
to
have,
or
to
have
contrary
regulations.
but
if
it's
something
that
doesn't
have
to
do
with
banking
at
all,
then
i
suppose
they
would
say...
i
can
ask
them...
i
suppose
they
say
the
state
has
authority
to
regulate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
for
the
proposition
that
an
agency
and
not
the
congress
defines
the
extent
of
field
preemption?
