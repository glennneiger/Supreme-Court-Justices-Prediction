justice

h.

let
me
ask
the
question...
the
regulatory
question.
you
do
not
dispute
michigan
does
not
dispute
that
the
operating...
well,
strike
that.
michigan
does
not
dispute
that
national
banks
can
go
into
business
of
real
estate
loans?
and
michigan
does
not
dispute
that
congress
has
authorized
national
banks
to
operate
through
subsidiaries
for
specific
purposes
like
this.
my
question
is
can
you
give
me
any
plausible
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
contemplated
this
system
of
potentially
more
restrictive
state
legislation
when
its
national
bank
in
a
given
instance
decides
to
do...
to
exercise
its
federal
banking
power
through
a
subsidiary
rather
than
directly?
can
you
think
of
any
reason
that
congress
would
have
contemplated
the
scheme
that
you're,
that
you're
defending?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if,
if...
if
the
banks
have
got,
let's
say,
a
subsidiary
has
to
go
through
two
rounds
of
bank
inspection
every
year
instead
of
one
round,
it
is
going
to
cost
them
something.
regulation
costs
the
regulated
entity
something.
it
is
a
burden
on
them.
and
we
also
have
to
assume
that
there
may
be
instances...
you
brought
it
up...
in,
in
which
the,
the...
the
state
burden
is
heavier.
so
with
those
possibilities
in
mind,
can
you
think
of
any
reason
why
congress
in
authorizing
the
exercise
of
the
federal
banking
power
through
a
subsidiary
would
have
contemplated
michigan
or
any
state
would
have
this
authority?
it
seems
counterintuitive
to
me.
they're
saying
you
can...
you
can...
you
banks
can
exercise
the
federal
banking
power
through
a
subsidiary.
it
would
seem
strange
to
me
that
congress
would
silently
say,
"and,
of
course,
we
acquiesce
to
a...
a
dual
system
of
regulation
that
would
not
apply
to
the
bank
itself.
"
what
reason
would
congress
have
had
for
assuming
that
might
be
the
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
is
state
sovereign
immunity
in
effect,
is
the
answer...
state
sovereignty
is
rather
the
answer?
