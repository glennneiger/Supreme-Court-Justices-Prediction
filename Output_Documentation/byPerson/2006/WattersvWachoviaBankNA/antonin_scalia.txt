justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
that
the
federal
regulating
authorities
require
a
certain
ratio
of
loans
to
real
estate
value,
things
of
that
sort.
and
i
assume
that
the
states
may
have
different
rules
with
regard
to
that;
right?
in
other
words,
the
oversight
might
be
different.
the
states
may
be
more
permissive
as
to
certain
loans
or
as
to,
you
know,
what
the
balance
sheet
of
the
bank
has
to
look
like
than
the
federal
government
is.
and
if
you
have
a
state
subsidiary
that
is
overseen
by
state
authorities,
you
might
have
a
different
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
not
i
don't
see
any
advantage
in
this
great
federal
banking
system
you're
talking
about,
if
it's
tweedledum
and
tweedledee.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
statute
defines
national
bank,
but
also
defines
affiliates,
and
refers
to
them
as
two
separate
entities.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
effect
of
this
regulation
is
to
simply
eliminate
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that
you
made
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
blanchard,
if
i
could
go
back
to
what
you
were
saying
before
this
last
line
of
questioning,
i
didn't
understand
your
position
to
be
that
the
occ
can
come
in
and
regulate
this
non-federal
bank
up
to
the
point
where
its...
well,
can
do
it
apparently
without
limitation.
and
where
its
regulation
conflicts
with
the
state
regulation,
the
federal
prevails.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
or
the
more
restrictive.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
government
says
you
can
have
outstanding
loans
of
$10
billion
and
the
state
says
no,
you
can
have
outstanding
loans
of
8
billion.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
what
happens
in
that
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
invent
some
other
hypothetical
then.
i'm
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
the
federal
law
is
more
permissive
than
the
state
law.
which
law
prevails?
the
federal
law
allows
this
bank
to
do
things
which
the
state
law
would
not
allow
it
to
do.
as
i
understood
your
prior
answer,
you
say
oh,
of
course,
if
the
federal
law
allows
to
it
do
things
the
state
law
doesn't
allow
to
it
do,
the
federal
law
prevails.
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
position.
and
if
it
is
your
position,
i
don't
know
what
all
this
fuss
is
about.
that's
the
end
of
the
game,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
exempt
from
state
examination?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
question.
justice
ginsburg
is
trying
to
find
out
if
you
know
any
other
situation
where
when
the
federal
agency
doesn't
do
an
adequate
job,
the
state
agency
comes
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
civil
rights
actions
where
there's
a
federal
agency
that
has
some
remedial
powers
and
if
the
federal
agency
doesn't
act,
the
citizen
is
free
to
bring
litigation
in
state
court?
i
guess
that
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
this
go
through
your...
can
i
just
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
still
goes
to
the
same
thing.
does
michigan
do
this
by
grace?
if
michigan
wanted
to,
could
it
just
tell
the
feds
to
butt
out
and
say,
you
know,
all
these
years
we've
been
letting
you
come
in
first,
and
we
only
step
in
when
we
think
you
haven't
done
a
good
job,
but
we've
had
it.
[laughter]
especially
after
this
lawsuit,
get
out,
we're
going
to
regulate
our
state
banks?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
in
michigan.
i'm
saying,
could
michigan
change
its
statutory
scheme
to
kick
the
feds
out?
or
would
that
be
prevented
by
this
federal
statute
we're
discussing
here?
i'm
trying
to
see
what
you
think
this
federal
statute
does.
or
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think,
the
question
is
not
whether
it
can
preempt
state
laws
but
whether
the
rulemaking
authority
can,
can
eliminate
a,
a
basic
division
of
the
statute
into
a
national
bank
and
affiliates
of
the
national
bank.
the
statute
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
the
two.
and
the
effect
of
what,
of
what
the
agency
has
to
done
here
is
simply
to
eliminate
that
distinction,
and
to
say
really
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
an
affiliate
of
a
national
bank,
you
have
the
same
immunity
that
the
national
bank
has.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
an
operating
subsidiary
is
an
affiliate,
right?
what
kind
of
affiliates
did
they
have
before
they
had
operating
subsidiaries?
did
they
rent
pool
halls,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
that
any
affiliate
of
a
national
bank
would,
would
be
engaged
in
essentially
banking
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
a
functionally
regulated
subsidiary
of
a
depository
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
a
functionally
regulated
subsidiary?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
just
engaging
in
banking
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
comes
next?
can
the--
occ
say,
well,
the
corporate
law
of
this
state
doesn't
really
allow
subsidiaries
to
do
as
much
as
we
think
a
subsidiary
of
a
national
bank
ought
to
be
able
to
do,
so
we're
going
to
attribute
additional
corporate
powers
to
this
subsidiary?
can
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
troubles
me,
and
maybe
you
can
answer
to
it
more
specifically
than
you
have,
is
that
the
core
function
of
a
banking
regulatory
agency
is
the
visitation
power,
and
the
banking
act
makes
it
very
clear
that
there
is
visitation
power
to
national
banks
and
makes
it
very
clear
that
there
is
not
for
subsidiaries.
and
here
is
a
regulation
which
under
the
guise,
it
seems
to
me,
of
defining
the
powers
of
the
national
bank
simply
eliminates
that
distinction.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
goes
beyond
what
an
agency
regulation
is
allowed
to
do.
