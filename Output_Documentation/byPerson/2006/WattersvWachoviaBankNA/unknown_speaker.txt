i'm
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
it.
as
i
understood
the
case
that
came,
i
don't
think
there's
disagreement
on
either
side
about
how
conflict
preemption
works.
but
i
thought
your
position
was
that
more
is
involved
here
and
that
the
state
can't
regulate
it
at
all,
and
you're
not
getting
into
a
conflict
preemption
question.
it's
just
if
it's
a
state
regulation
it
can't--
