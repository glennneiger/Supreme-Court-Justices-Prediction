justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
finish,
please?
you
argued,
as
i
understand
it,
correctly,
that
the
state
does,
exercises
certain
regulatory
controls
that
will
not
be
exercised...
will
not
be
replaced
by
federal
controls;
is
that
right?
in
other
words,
you...
that
they
will
be
unregulated
to
a
certain
extent?
there
will
be
less
regulation
under
the
federal
sovereign
than
there
is
under
the
state;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
some
specific
examples
of
what
michigan
would
require
that
the
occ
does
not
require?
you
mentioned
licensing,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
have
any
impact
on
the
way
they
run
their
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
does
it
make
any
difference
as
a
matter
of
what
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
comply
with
the
law
that
they
are
now
exempt
from
michigan
rules
and
subject
to
federal
rules
instead?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blanchard,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
i
just
want
to
understand.
wachovia
has
branch
banks
all
over
the
country.
are
they
generally
subsidiaries
or
are
they
divisions
of
the
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
i'm
asking
a
factual
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
actually
divisions,
in
effect,
of
the
national
bank
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
they
are
not
separate
corporate
subsidiaries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that,
that
the
best
bank
decided
to
use
the
subsidiary
approach
for
this
business,
rather
than
the
more
traditional
banking
approach.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
protects
from
liability,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
take
a
field
preemption
position,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it's
truly
broader
than
just
conflict
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
literally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
wachovia
have
any
branch
banks
in
michigan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
states
in
which
wachovia
has
both
branch
banks
and
subsidiaries
comparable
to
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
as
long
as
this
mortgage
company
was
a
subsidiary
of
a
holding
company
rather
than
the
bank
itself,
the
state
would
have
done
the
visiting,
the
visitorial
power,
whereas
once
they
changed
the
federal
government
assumed
that
responsibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
your
co-counsel
pointed
out,
previously
this
very
company
was
a
subsidiary
of
a
holding
company
that
also
owned
the
bank,
and
at
that
time
it
was
exclusively
regulated
by
michigan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
change
in
the
corporate
structure
is
the
sole
basis
for
saying
now
it's
exclusively
regulated
by
the
occ?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
results
in
field
preemption
to
the
extent
that
the
exercise
of
visitorial
power
is
a
regulatory
function?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
now
only
the
federal
agency
that
does
the
visiting,
whereas
it
used
to
be
only
the
state
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
that
led
me
to
is
how
many
additional
personnel
did
ooc
employ
when
it
took
over
this
area
for
48
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
certainly
quite
a
few
people,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
authority
under
the
old
regime
was
just
to
make
sure
that
the
operation
did
not
affect
the
financial
stability
of
the
parent
bank.
