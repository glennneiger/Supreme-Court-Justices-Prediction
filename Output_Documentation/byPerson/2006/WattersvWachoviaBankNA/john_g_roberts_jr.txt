chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-1342,
watters
v.
wachovia
bank.
mr.
blanchard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
they
do
that?
what's
the
advantage
to
them
having
that
subsidiary
rather
than
doing
this
directly?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
mortgage
subsidiary
could
possibly
get
into
some
trouble
that
the
bank
wants
to
protect
itself
from
and
not
have...
they
have
a
certain
number
of
assets
that
are
subject
to
liability
in
the
subsidiary,
but
they
would...
otherwise
they'd
expose
the
whole
bank
to
those
liabilities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
seeking
visit...
"visitorial",
is
that
the
word?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
seeking
visitorial
rights
with
respect
to
the
parent
bank.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
arguing
that
because
you
need
to
see
more
about
the
mortgage--
subsidiary
you
need
to
see
what
the
parent
is
up
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
their
argument,
they
haven't
argued...
i
realize
this
was
a
hypothetical,
but
they
haven't
argued
that
the
subsidiary
should
be
treated
as
a
national
bank.
they're
arguing
that
they're
entitled
to
say
that
the
same
preemption
that
applies
to
the
national
bank
applies
to
the
subsidiaries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
presumably,
if
they
said
it's
treated
as
a
national
bank
they
would
lose
the
benefit
of
the
separate
corporate
existence
when
it
came
to
issues
of
liability.
if
they
said
this
subsidiary
is
a
national
bank,
then
presumably
the
separate
corporate
existence
they're
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
would
be
obliterated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
they
don't
want
to,
they
don't
have
to
set
up
a
separate
subsidiary,
right?
they
can
do
this
business
directly
as
a
national
bank
and
they're
not
going
to
be
subject
to
any
visitation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
yes,
that
they
get
to
regulate
to
the
extent
they
want
to,
and
the
state
does,
and
if
there's
a
conflict,
the
federal
regulation
will
prevail,
but
what's
the
problem
here
is
that
they're
issuing
a
categorical
regulation
saying
the
state
can't
regulate
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
their
position
is
not
that
it
only
preempts
in
cases
of
conflict.
under
12c
apart,
7.4006,
it
says,
state
laws
apply
to
national
bank
operated
subsidiaries,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
to
the
same
extent
that
those
laws
apply
to
the
parent
national
bank,
which
is
to
say
not
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
not
a
case
of
conflict
preemption.
they're
trying
to
preempt
state
law
whether
it
conflicts
or
not,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
environmental
regulation
where
just
because
the
federal
epa
doesn't
take
a
particular
action
against
a
polluter,
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can't
take
action
against
the
polluter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
federal--
u.s.
attorney
prosecutes,
decides
to
prosecute
someone
for
manslaughter,
the
state
can
decide
that's
not
an
adequate
enough
response
and
prosecute
them
for
murder,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
better
hurry
then.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
a
subsidiary
that's
in
the
mortgage
lending
business
that
presumably
competes
with
other
companies
in
the
mortgage
lending
business
that
are
not
associated
with
national
banks,
and
you're
claiming
an
immunity
from
the
regulation
that
their
competitors
are
subject
to.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
fine,
and
they
have
an
express
provision
in
48...
484(a)
that
says
they're,
they're
exempt
from
regulation.
the
question
is
whether
a
separate
subsidiary
that
is
not
a
national
bank
that
competes
with
other
mortgage
lending
companies
is
immune
from
the
regulation
that
those
other
companies--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--justice
breyer's
questions
were
pointing
out,
to
the
extent
your
regulation...
the
federal
regulation
of
your
subsidiary
conflicts
with
the
state
law,
that
regulation
is
going
to
prevail.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
are
immune
from
state
regulation
across
the
board--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--one
of
those
laws
might
be,
i
mean,
let's
say
they
have
a
law,
when
you're
issuing
a
mortgage
to
a
consumer,
you
have
to
give
them
a
disclosure
about
how
much
they're
going
to
end
up
paying
over
the
life
of
the
loan
and
all
that.
and
they
require
that
of
anybody
who
issues
a
mortgage
in
michigan.
could
that
law
be
applied
to
your
subsidiary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't...
isn't
your
friend
correct
then?
you
are
really
trying
to
have
your
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
you're
saying
if
we
did
this
without
a
subsidiary,
we
wouldn't
be
subject
to
that.
but
you
want
to
be
able
to
operate
through
a
subsidiary
and
yet
not
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
that
apply
to
other
people.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
when
then
federal
law
says
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
that
they're
referring
to
state
regulation
as
opposed
to
the
same
federal
regulation
that
applies
to
the
national
banks?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
7.4006
issued
pursuant
to...
what
did
you
call
it,
glba?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
or
did
it
predate
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
it
conflict
with
federal
banking
authority
for
the
state
to
audit
the
books
of
the
mortgage
subsidiary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
take
my
earlier
case
about
the
consumer
disclosure.
michigan
has
a
law,
i
assume,
that
any
mortgage
lender
has
to
tell
the
consumer
all
this
information.
would
that
conflict
with
the
authority
of
a
national
bank?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
any
regulation
would
conflict
with
the
national
bank
status?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
field
preemption
when
it
comes
to
regulation.
yes,
if
the
bank
is
sued
the
normal
rules
of
contract
are
going
to
apply
for
enforcing
a
contract.
but
you're
claiming
field
preemption
with
respect
to
regulation,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
state
laws
generally...
state
agencies
generally
don't
regulate
national
banks
at
all,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
an
effort
of
the
state
to
prohibit
the
national
bank
from
engaging
in
the
activity,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
obvious
case
of
conflict
preemption.
here
we
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
can
regular
the
operating
subsidiary
to
any
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
should
we
assume
that
they
wanted
to
preempt
state
laws
to
that
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
aspect
of
state
law,
including
liability
limitation,
that
they
want
to
take
advantage
of
by
establishing
a
subsidiary
chartered
under
state
law,
michigan
or
another
state,
and
yet
they're
claiming
immunity
from
all
other
state
regulations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
blanchard,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
blanchard.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
no.
05-1342,
watters
versus
wachovia
bank.
