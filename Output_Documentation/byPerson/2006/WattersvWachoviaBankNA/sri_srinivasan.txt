mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
addressing
this
question
of
whether
what's
going
on
here
is
conflict
preemption
or
field
preemption.
now,
it
depends
on
how
one
defines
those
terms.
but
as
we
understand
it
it's
conflict
preemption,
not
field
preemption,
in
the
following
sense.
our
position
is
not
that
state
laws
have
no
application
to
operating
subsidiaries
or
to
national
banks
for
that
matter.
it's
that
state
laws
apply
to
the
same
extent
to
operating
subsidiaries
as
they
would
to
national
banks.
and
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
the
atherton
case
and
in
the
barnett
bank
case,
state
laws
do
apply
to
national
banks
and
operating
subsidiaries
in
a
variety
of
respects,
and
state
contract
law
would
be
an
example.
but
with
operating
subsidiaries
in
particular,
state
laws
dealing
with
corporate
governance
questions,
for
example
the
process
of
incorporation,
dissolution,
shareholder
voting,
and
things
of
that
sort,
would
be
controlling
and
so
federal
law
doesn't
control
those
sorts
of
aspects.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
degree
to
which
the
regulations
apply
to
the
national
banks.
that's
my
only
point,
is
that
state
laws
apply
to
the
same
extent
to
the
operating
subsidiary
as
to
the
national
bank.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
state
agencies
don't
generally
do
that
because
there's
a
specific
statutory
prohibition
on
that.
and
justice
scalia,
this
goes
to
your
questions
about
the
scope
of
these
provisions
at
12--
u.s.c.
484(a)
and
481.
it's
true
that
those
provisions
say
by
their
terms
that
visitorial
authority
resides
exclusively
with
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
with
respect
to
national
banks,
and
there's
another
provision
that
deals
with
affiliates.
and
so
that's
the
point
with
visitorial
authority.
but
visitorial
authority
by
its
very
nature
is
asserted
in
service
of
and
enforcement
of
some
underlying
substantive
requirement,
and
the
underlying
substantive
requirement
at
issue
here
is
the
requirement
that
operating
subsidiaries
register
with
the
state.
and
so
there's
a
question
of
conflict
preemption
that
applies
both
to
the
national
bank
and
the
operating
subsidiary
of
whether
that
underlying
substantive
registration
requirement
could
be
applied
to
the
national
bank
or
could
be
applied
to
the
operating
subsidiary.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"holding
company",
justice
stevens.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right,
because
it
wasn't
an
operating
subsidiary
of
a
federally
chartered
national
bank.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
is,
but
it's
changing
the
corporate
structure
in
a
fundamentally
important
way.
that's
that
it's
no
owned
and
controlled
by
a
federally
chartered
national
bank.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
again
it
depends
on
how
one
defines
those
terms.
and
i
don't
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
this
became
a
subsidiary--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
have
an
empirical
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
but
justice
stevens,
in
the
regulatory
materials
that
attended
the
promulgation
of
these
rules
occ
specifically
addressed
the
question
whether
it
had
sufficient
resources
to
exercise
oversight
authority
over
operating
subsidiaries
of
national
banks.
and
let's
be
clear.
it's
not
that
the
occ
previously
had
no
authority
over
operating
subsidiaries.
the
question
is
whether
the
occ
has
exclusive
authority
over
operating
subsidiaries.
and
the
occ
determined
in
the
regulatory
materials
that
it
had
sufficient
resources
to
exercise
oversight
authority
over
operating
subsidiaries--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
that's
because
it
wasn't
an
operating
subsidiary
of
a
federally
chartered
national
bank,
and
that
changes
things
in
a
fundamental
way
for
the
following
reason:
that
under
the
barnett
bank
case
the
rule
of
preemption,
the
special
rule
of
preemption
that
applies
in
the
context
of
national
banking,
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
enumerated
or
incidental
powers
of
national
banks...
and
one
incidental
power
of
a
national
bank
is
undisputed
to
be
the
power
to
conduct
affairs
through
an
operating
subsidiary...
that
the
grants
of
those
powers
are
normally
preemptive
of
rather
than
preempted
by
state
law.
and
so
once
the
operating--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that
was.
but
the
court--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
the
court's
decisions
aren't
limited
to
prohibitions
of
that
sort.
i'd
make
two
points
in
that
regard.
first
of
all,
in
one
sense
this
is
a
prohibition,
because
the
operating
subsidiary
can't
engage
in
federally
authorized
activities
unless
and
until
it
gets
the
state's
permission.
so
at
least
there
is
a
prohibition
at
the
outset.
but
more
importantly,
the
court's
cases
aren't
limited
to
situations
involving
prohibitions
of
the
sort
that
your
honor
posits,
because
in
the
franklin
national
bank
case
that
was
a
situation
in
which
the
national
bank
had
the
power
to
accept
savings
deposits
and
the
state
law
that
was
deemed
to
be
preempted
there
didn't
prohibit
the
national
bank
from
accepting
savings
deposits.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
not
if
you're
talking
about
corporate
powers,
because
those
are
governed
by
state
law.
what
it
could
do,
though,
is
regulate
the
subsidiary's
conduct
of
the
business
of
banking,
because,
after
all,
an
operating
subsidiary
has
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
and
that's
to
carry
out
functions
that
the
national
bank
itself
could
perform.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
the
statutes
say
that
at
all.
there
is
a
statute,
484(a),
that
says
that
the
occ's
visitorial
authority
is
exclusive
with
respect
to
national
banks.
but
there
is
no
statute
that
says
that
the
occ's
visitorial
authority
is
not
exclusive
with
respect
to
subsidiaries.
there's
another
statute
that
deals
with
affiliates.
now
one
point
is
that
affiliates
are
not
limited
to
subsidiaries,
but
they
could
include
for
example,
i
guess
brother
and
sister
corporations
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
that
are
controlled
by
a
common
parent.
but
another
point
is
that
at
the
time
these
statutes
were
enacted,
congress
simply
didn't
have
within
its
field
of
vision
the
notion
that
a
national
bank
would
have
the
power
to
exercise
its
functions
through
a
subsidiary
corporation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
the
occ
had
exclusive
visitorial
authority
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
national
bank
function.
it's
just
at
the
time
that
these
statutes
were
enacted,
the
only
play
that
national
bank
functions
were
being
conducted
was
by
a
national
bank
itself.
now
later
on,
when
the
laws
of
all
50
states,
the
ots,
the
federal
reserve
with
respect
to
state
member
banks,
and
the
comptroller
gives
banks
the
authority
to
conduct
national...
to
conduct
bank
functions
through
its
subsidiaries,
then
this
issue
arises
about
who
exercises
visitorial
authority
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
those
functions
for
a
subsidiary.
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
the
baseline
rule
is
that
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
national
bank
functions
through
a
national
bank
itself,
the
occ
visitorial
authority
is
exclusive,
then
when
a
national
bank
exercises
its
federal
entitlement
to
conduct
those
very
same
functions
through
an
operating
subsidiary,
the
occ's
visitorial
authority,
likewise,
would
be
exclusive.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
entirely
reasonable
regulatory
determination
by
the
comptroller,
and
there's
nothing
in
those
statutory
provisions
that
speaks
directly
to
that
issue
and
that
in
any
way
precludes
the
comptroller
from
reaching
that
determination.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
there
could
be.
i
don't
know
about
this
particular
case
but
there
absolutely
could
be,
justice
ginsburg,
because
when
they
become
subsidiaries
they
are
controlled
by
the
national
bank
and
not
by
some
other
entity.
and
the
reason
that
a
national
bank
would
choose
to
engage
in
this
sort
of
structure
rather
than
folding
the
enterprise
into
the
bank
itself
are
many
fold.
and
in
part
it's
for
efficiency
purposes
because
you
can
have
focused
management,
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
the
sort
of
specialized
things
that
operating
subsidiaries
typically
do.
but
there's
also
other
reasons.
for
example,
there's
a
modularity
component
to
this
in
the
sense
that
the
best
specialized
functions
such
as
mortgage
lending,
very
often
a
national
bank
will
purchase
an
entity
that
conducts
that
activity,
and
may
be
interested
in
selling
the
entity
later,
and
it's
much
more
straightforward
to
do
that
if
those
functions
are
maintained
in
a
separate
subsidiary
corporation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
with
respect
to
liability
limitation
in
particular,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
clarify
that
veil
piercing
principles
and
things
of
that
sort
would
be
governed
by
state
law
with
respect
to
the
operating
subsidiary.
so
if
the
question
is
whether
the
corporate
veil
is
pierced,
state
law
would
dictate
an
answer
to
that
question.
but,
may
i
just
finish
one
thought?
states
won't
have
an
incentive
to
liberally
construe
veil
piercing
principles
with
respect
to
national
banks
precisely
because
state
member
banks
in
all
50
states
also
have
operating
subsidiaries
through
which
they
charter
banks
to
conduct
banking
functions.
thank
you.
