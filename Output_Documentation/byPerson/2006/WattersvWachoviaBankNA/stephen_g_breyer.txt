justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
it
was
a
national
bank.
forget
the
subsidiary.
and
your
state
says:
well,
we
want
to
have
a
law
here
that
says
we
want
to
send
our
own
bank
examiners
in.
and
moreover,
we
don't
want
them
to
make
any
loans
in
excess
of
12
percent
interest.
fine.
would
that
be
constitutional?
i
mean,
wouldn't
be
preempted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course,
because
it
conflicts
and
they
don't
want
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
do
they
have
the
authority
to
say
a
subsidiary
is
a
national
bank?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
can't?
where
is
it
in
the
law
that
says
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
say
that
a
subsidiary
of
a
national
bank
owned
by
a
national
bank
is
a
national
bank?
is
there
something
specifically
that
stops
them
from
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it?
what
is
it...
i
mean,
what
statute
or
what
is
it
that
prevents
them
from
saying
it?
i
don't
know
the
gold
foods
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
it
have
exactly
the
same
power
that
any
other
agency
or
congress
has?
that
it
has
the
power,
if
its
regulation
is
authorized,
it
has
the
power
to
what
they
say,
preempt
a
state
law
that
obstructs,
impairs,
or
conditions
a
bank's
ability
fully
to
exercise
its
federally
authorized
real
estate
lending
powers?
that's
what
they
say,
and
then
they
list
some
examples.
suppose
they
said
nothing.
wouldn't
we
be
in
the
same
boat?
after
all,
a
state
cannot
under
the
federal
constitution
normally
enact
a
law
that
interferes
or
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
achievement
of
the
objective
of
the
federal
law.
so
if
that's
right,
or
if
it's
wrong,
explain
why
it's
wrong,
but
if
it's
right,
why
don't
you
tell
me
whether
the
two
laws
that
you
are
worried
about
do
or
do
not
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
achievement
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
as
implemented
by
their
regulation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that,
that
i
think
conflict
preemption
does
not
require
clear
language.
assume
that,
even
though
you
disagree
with
it.
now
on
my
assumption
that
you
can
have
the
law
if
it
doesn't
conflict,
but
you
can't
have
the
law
if
it
does
conflict,
so
now
you
explain
to
me
why
the
two
laws
at
issue
here
don't
conflict.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
not
looking
for
that.
we're
looking
for
the
opposite.
as
i
read
this,
the
banking
agency
has
not
said,
we
wipe
out
all
of
your
laws.
they've
said,
we
wipe
out
a
subset
of
laws,
which
are
defined
as
those
laws
that
obstruct,
impair,
or
limit
the
ability
of
this
bank
to
fulfill
its
federally
mandated
powers.
okay?
so
they're
just
saying,
we
only
get
the
ones
that
are
in
conflict.
now,
they
then
have
a
list
of
which
ones
they
preempt
and
which
ones
they
don't.
so
my
question
to
you
is,
give
me
a
list
here
of
which
ones
they
think
conflict
that
you
think
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question
i
had.
i
got
somewhat
thrown
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
i
thought
first,
when
i
read
the
reg,
34.4.ab,
that
those
things
that
are
preempted
are
those
things
that
obstruct,
impair
or
condition,
or
in
other
words
limit,
the
federal
powers
of
a
national
bank.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
thought
we
were
basically
dealing
with
conflict--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
fielding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
the
last
part
of
the
reg
says
that
what
applies,
no
state
law
applies
to
a
national
bank
operating
subsidiary
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
parent
bank.
and
i
began
to
think
it
fields
preemption.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
it
is
conflict
preemption,
not
field,
because
it
is
conflict
in
the
case
of
a
national
bank?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
conflict
preemption
basically
strikes
down
a
state
law
that
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
enforcement
of
the
federal
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
suppose
that
you
didn't
have
either
7.4006
or
34.4(a)(b).
neither
existed.
but
we
listened
to
what
the
agency
said
as
a
court
and
they
explained
how
the
regulation
worked.
would
you
expect
to
come
to
precisely
the
same
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
would
you...
would
you
expect
to
come
to
the
same
result
or
not?
