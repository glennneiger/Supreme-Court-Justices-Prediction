mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
question
that
justice
souter
asked
because
there
are
some
important
principles
that
are
really
not
disputed
in
this
case,
and
i
think
they
help
to
focus
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute,
as
we
understand
it,
that
mortgage
lending
by
national
banks
is
supervised
exclusively
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
and
there
is
also
no
dispute
that
national
banks'
incidental
powers
under
section
247
include
the
power
to
make
mortgage
loans
through
a
operating
subsidiary.
and
an
additional
point
is
that
both
federal
statutes
and
federal
regulations
state
that
when
national
banks
make
mortgage
loans
or
exercise
their
banking
powers
through
subsidiaries
they
do
so
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
that
apply
to
the
exercise
of
the
power
by
the
national--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
a
branch
of
a
national
bank
has
a
particular
status
under
section
36
of
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
would
not
be
separately
incorporated.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
they
are
generally
referred
to
as
branches
but
i
think
its
would
be
more
a
division.
that
would
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that...
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
anything
that
a
bank
does
through
an
operating
subsidiary
it
could
do
through
the
bank.
it
can
always
do
it
through
the
bank.
but
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
bank
may
choose
an
operating
subsidiary.
they
can
be
managerial
reasons;
it's...
just
sometimes
works
better
as
matter
of
business
management.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
although--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
will
say,
justice
stevens,
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
examples
of
national
bank
operating
subsidiaries
that
have
become
insolvent.
they
are
regulated
very
heavily
by
the
comptroller
and
so
they
don't.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
but
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
national
banks
compete.
and
its
undisputed--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
thrifts,
s&ls,
state-chartered
banks
in
all
50
states
are
permitted
to
have
operating
subsidiaries.
it's
recognized
not
just
for
national
banks,
but
really
for
all
types
of
banking
institutions,
that
are
operating
subsidiaries
are
a
useful
tool
of
banking.
this
is
not
a
sort
of
special
privilege
that's
given--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
and
you
asked
that
question.
i
mean,
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
think
first
about
national
banks
and
then
about
the
operating
subsidiaries.
it
is
not
true
that
there
are
no
state
laws
that
apply
to
national
banks.
this
court's
unanimous
barnett
bank
decision
is
the
clearest
statement
of
the
principle.
any
state
laws
that
prevent
or
significantly
impair
or
impede
the
exercise
of
national
banking
powers
are
preempted.
but
many
state
laws
having
to
do
with
contracts--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
beginning
is,
it
is
a
complete
separate
set
of
regulation.
you
have
to
register
or
obtain
a
license.
you
have
to
submit
to
examination
by
the
regulator.
investigation.
enforcement.
there
are
substantive
laws;
michigan
has
some
that
are
not
directly
at
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
is
it
preempted
as
to
the
national
bank?
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
would
say
yes.
but
the
issue
in
this
case
is
if
it
is
preempted
as
to
the
national
bank,
then
it
is
also
preempted
when
the
national
bank
chooses
to
exercise
this
power
that
it
has
under
section
24--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
it,
it
with
respect,
it
is
not
really
a
case
of
having
our
cake
and
eating
it,
too.
we
are
in
the
area
of
powers
of
national
banks.
and
the
court
has
recognized
for
a
century
that
in
that
area,
when
national
banks
have
powers,
including
incidental
powers
recognized
by
the
comptroller,
they
generally
preempt
any
state
law
that
prevents
or
significantly
interferes--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's...
that's
one
level--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well...
it's,
it's
a
very
important
point.
and
our
position
is
there
are
actually
several
ways
in
which
you
could
analyze
this
case
and
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
comptroller's
regulations
are
valid.
one
is
looking
simply
at
statutory
language
and
saying
we
would,
we
the
court
would
reach
this
result
as
we
did
in
the
franklin
national
bank
case
even
without
any
regulation.
and
second
of
all
is
to
say
the
regulations
are
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
a
third
is
to
say
that
the
comptroller
has
broad
rulemaking
authority.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
de
la
cuesta
and
many
other
cases,
an
agency
exercising
its
rulemaking
authority
can
preempt
state
laws
even
though
the
statute
itself
would
not--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no.
it...
i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
have
a
two-part
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia.
one
is
that
section
484
of
the
section
you're
referring
to
does
limit
the
visitorial
authority
as
to
national
banks,
but
it
is
silent
as
to
operating
subsidiaries
or
any
other
type
of
affiliate.
states
do
exercise
visitorial
authority
over
some
affiliates
of
national
banks.
that's
established.
operating
subsidiaries
are
a
special
type
of
affiliate;
484,
which
was
enacted
during
the
civil
war,
a
hundred
years
before
operating
subsidiaries
were
authorized,
really
doesn't
address
the
question
of
visitorial
authority.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's
a
type
of
affiliate--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but,
but
this
really
became
clear,
in
answer
to
your
question,
in
part
two
of
my
answer.
in
1999
when
congress
enacted
the
gramm-leach-bliley
act,
it
directly
addressed
this
question
of
affiliates
of
national
banks.
and
this
is
on
page
2a
of
our
appendix.
it
refers
to,
it
created
a
new
type
of
affiliate,
for
the
first
time,
financial
subsidiaries
which
can
do
anything
financial
in
nature.
so
they
can
actually
engage
in
activities
that
the
parent
national
bank
could
not.
but
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
2a
of
our
appendix,
this
is
section
24a
now
of
the
act,
it
said
that
financial
subsidiaries
can
also
engage
in
activities
that
are
permitted
for
national
banks
to
engage
in
directly,
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
that
govern
the
conduct
of
the
activities
by
a
national
bank.
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
3a
and
going
over
to
4a
where
they
actually
define
financial
subsidiaries,
they
do
so
by
distinguishing
them
from
the
operating
subsidiaries
which
had
existed
for
decades.
and
at
the
top
of
4a
you
see
that
the
operating
subsidiary
again
engages
only
in
activities
that
the
national
banks
may
engage
in
directly
and
are
conducted
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions.
then
if
you'll
bear
with
me
a
moment
longer,
on
page
12a
of
our
appendix
some
additional
provisions
of
glba...
actually,
that's
the
gramm-leach-bliley
act,
glba
people
call
it...
said...
this
is
on
12a...
that
securities
activities
and
insurance
activities,
activities
that
have
been
traditionally
subject
to
state
regulation,
if
they're
engaged
in
by
a
functionally
regulated
subsidiary,
operating
subsidiary
or
a
financial
subsidiary,
then
they
may
be
regulated
by
relevant
state
securities
authorities
or
state
insurance
authorities.
so
congress
was
actually
quite
specific.
i
mean,
your
question
is
about
statutory
language.
you
don't
find
this
in
484,
which
is,
since
it's
a
century
old,
doesn't
really
get
into
this.
but
in
this
1999
statute,
it's
all
about
subsidiaries
of
national
banks.
congress
was
pretty
clear
if
it's
securities,
if
it's
insurance,
it
can
be
regulated
by
states.
they
were
specific
about
that.
if
it's
a
banking
activity
that
the
bank
itself
can
undertake,
it's
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions.
and
so,
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
have
this
question
of
would
it
be
a
preempted
state
preempted
state
law
if
it
were
applied
to
the
national
bank
when
the
national
bank
is
making
a
mortgage
loan.
not
every
state
law
is
preempted
because
not
every
state
law
conflicts.
but
if
it
does--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
mean,
we
have
section
7.4006,
which
is
the
0cc's
regulation
interpreting
that
language
in
the
statute
and
in
its
own
opsub
regulations,
section
5.34.
and
we
also
relied
simply
on
the
ordinary
meaning
of
"terms
and
conditions".
it
means
prerequisites,
limitations.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
glba?
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
7.4006
was
issued
pursuant
to
24-7,
which
is
this
incidental
powers
provision,
and
24(a),
which
i've
just
been
walking
you
through,
which
is
a
provision
of
glba.
so
it
is
based
partly
upon
glba,
and
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
same
terms
and
conditions
language.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
of
course--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
do
have
them
and
we
think
that
makes
the
case
easier,
of
course.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
we
would
say
that
if
you
start
with
24-7
and
the
incidental
powers
of
national
banks
and
the
undisputed
point
that
one
of
those
incidental
powers
is
for
the
national
bank--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it
has
been
established
since
the
beginning
of
the
national
banking
system
that...
and
this
goes
back
to
the
history
of
the
first
and
second
bank
of
the
united
states
in
mccullough
against
maryland...
that
the
national
banking
system
is
protected
from
possibly
unfriendly
state
legislation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
comptroller's
view
as
i
understand
it
is
that
it
would.
but
again
let
me
emphasize--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
may
go
too
far.
but
i
think
what
comptroller
has
done,
it
has...
has
been
to
look
at
a
series
of
these
state
regulations
and
determine
whether
in
fact
they
do
impair
or
impede
the
exercise--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
our
position
is
there
are
multiple
roots
that
we
can
win
this
case.
one
is
based
on
conflict
preemption.
another--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
of
course.
and
another
route
is
simply
that
the
agency
has--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
and
the
agency
has
broad
rulemaking
power.
it's
exercised
it
here.
there's
really
no
dispute
about
what
the
occ's
rules
mean.
the
only
question
is
whether
they're
valid
and
then
what
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
an
agency
and
not
the...
certainly
the
delaquesta
line
of
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
an
agency
has
preempted
state
law
by
regulation,
the
questions
are
simply
whether
the
agency
has
acted
within
the
scope
of
its
delegated
authority
and
whether
it
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
of
the
conflicting
principles
and
whether
there's
any
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
disagreed
with
it.
are
there...
i
mean,
there
are
examples.
for
example,
in
the
world
of
federal
thrifts
ots
has
a
sort
of
field
preemption
as
i
understand
it.
it's
evolved
differently
in
the
world
of
national
banks.
that's
conflict
preemption.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
that
that
again
goes
to
this
scheme
of
glba
that
i
was
trying
to
describe.
the
notion
that
congress
had
is
that
you're
going
to
regulate
by
function.
so
if
it's
insurance,
the
state
can
regulate
it
whether
it's
in
the
subsidiary
or
in
the
bank.
if
it's
securities,
the
sec
and
in
some
circumstances
the
states
can
regulate
it.
but
if
it's
core
banking
functions
like
mortgage
lending,
that's
going
to
be
regulated
subject
to
the
same
terms
and
conditions
that
apply
when
the
bank
itself
conducts
those
activities.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
the
concept
as
i
understand
it.
it's
going
by
function
and
we
think
that
shows
actually
congress
did--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--wachovia
does
not,
although...
i
mean,
an
interesting
feature
of
the
michigan
law
is
if
they
did
michigan's
law
would
not
apply,
which
we
think
is
not
consistent
with
their
view
that
the
occ
is
an
inadequate
regulator,
because
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
whether
or
not
there's
a
branch.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
yes.
north
carolina
and
others.
i
will
add,
there
was
a
point
at
the
beginning
that
this
wachovia
mortgage
company
actually
was
regulated
by
michigan
for
6
years
and
there
were
no
problems.
during
that
period
it
was
a
subsidiary
of
a
bank
holding
company,
and
that's
a
completely
different
situation.
those
are
not
regulated
at
all
by
the
occ.
so
of
course
they
were
regulated
by
michigan.
that's
the
way
subsidiaries
of
bank
holding
companies
are
regulated.
that's
simply
a
different
situation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will--
