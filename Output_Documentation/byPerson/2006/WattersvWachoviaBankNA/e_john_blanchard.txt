mr.
e.
john
blanchard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dual
banking
system
of
state
and
federal
regulation
in
our
nation
which
we've
enjoyed
for
over
140
years
is
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
cooperative
federalism
in
our
history.
for
35
years,
the
states,
not
the
occ,
have
prudently
exercised
their
authority
over
non-bank
state-chartered
operating
local
subsidiaries
of
national
banks.
indeed,
respondent
wachovia
mortgage
complied
with
michigan
law
for
6
years
until
in
2003
there
was
a
corporate
reshuffling
and
now
it
claims
it's
exempt
from
the
same
michigan
laws
it
complied
with.
the
occ
through
its
regulation
7.40006
has
disrupted
the
careful
balance
and
seeks
to
deprive
the
states
of
the
regulatory
authority
that
they
have
historically
exercised.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
wachovia
bank
and
wachovia
mortgage
made
a
choice.
they
made
a
business
judgment
to
create
a
state-chartered
operating
subsidiary.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
your
honor,
the
advantage
is
that
wachovia
bank
insulates
itself
from
liability,
because
it's
a
bedrock
principle
of
state
corporate
law
that
the
parent
corporation
is
not
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
subsidiary
corporation.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
absolutely,
your
honor.
from...
the
conception
behind
operating
subsidiaries
was
to
separate
a
certain
part
of
the
business
and
the
attendant
risks
of
that
business
also
to
separate.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
possibly,
but--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--well,
the
states
do
not...
exclusive
visitorial
powers
over
national
banks
rest
with
the
occ.
but
wachovia
bank
and
wachovia
mortgage
are
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
correct.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
absolutely
not.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no,
we're
not.
michigan
and
the
states
want
to
be
able
to
help
their
citizens
with
abusive
and
predatory
lending
complaints.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
as
to
the
national
bank?
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
the
gold
foods
case,
the--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--well,
the
point
is
that
the
corporate
law
recognizes
the
two
as
separate
and
distinct
corporate
entities.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
you're
right.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
exactly.
that's
what
they--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--well,
but
that's
the...
they
are
trying
to
contend
that
they
are
one
and
the
same.
but
they
can't
have
their
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes,
that
is
my
understanding
of
their
position.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
they
are
saying
that
visitorial
powers
over
the
state-chartered
operating
subs
is
exclusively--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--they
take
the
authority...
the
position
that
michigan
has
no
authority
to
impose
on
the
state-chartered
operating
sub
the
two
michigan
laws--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--yes,
you're
correct.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no,
i've
not
heard
them
say
that
as
to
north
carolina
law.
but
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
michigan
mortgage
broker,
lenders
and
servicers
licensing
act
and
the
michigan
secondary
mortgage
act
do
not
apply
to
them.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
the
important
point,
though,
your
honor,
is
that
the
occ
has
no
independent
power
to
preempt
the
validly
enacted
legislation
of
a
sovereign
state.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
they
do
not.
first
of
all,
if
the
occ...
if
congress
intends
to
alter
the
balance
that
i
spoke
of
earlier,
it
must
do
so
with
clear
and
manifest
language.
there
must
be
unmistakably
clear
language
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
occ
to
preempt
the
state
law.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
your
honor,
in
the
barnett
case
and
in
the
atherton
case,
in
order
to
have
the
kind
of
problem
you're
talking
about,
there
must
be
a
significant
interference
with
the
business
of
banking
or
an
incapacitation
of
the
business
of
banking.
our
michigan
law
doesn't
incapacitate
what--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
occ
does
not
have
the
exclusive
right.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--you
are
absolutely
correct.
as
i
started
to
say
earlier,
they
made
that
choice
and
they
came
to
michigan,
and
they
obtained
a
certificate
of
authority
from
the
michigan
corporations
division
as
a
foreign
for-profit
corporation
doing
business
in
the
state.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
they
are
claiming
exclusive
preemptive
authority.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
in
that
wachovia
mortgage
as
a
subsidiary
of
a
national
bank
is
a
registrant
under
michigan
law.
and
as
a
registrant,
it
is
not
subject
to
an
annual--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--michigan
would
require
wachovia
mortgage
to
register.
there's
a
difference
between
registration
and
licensure.
as
a
subsidiary
of
wachovia
bank,
they
are
a
registrant
like
they've
been
for
the
last--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--no.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no.
michigan
just
wants
to
be
able
to...
and
the
other
states...
to
deal
with
fraud
and
deceit
and
material
misrepresentation
in
mortgage
transactions,
and
to
have
a
say
over
the
corporations
that
come
to
their
state
and
do
business.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
or
the
more
restrictive.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
that's
the
difference.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--well,
it
doesn't
happen
in
michigan
because--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--no,
your
honor.
you
see,
in...
we
do
not
conduct...
they
are
exempt
from
an
examination
where
we
go
in
and
look
yearly
at
such
things
as
capital
assets
management,
earnings,
liquidity.
those
aren't
the
kinds
of
things
that
we're
talking
about.
they,
as
a
registrant,
they
are
exempt
from
that,
from
an
annual
examination.
they're
not
incapacitated,
nor
are--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--yes.
the
state
chartered
corporation,
wachovia
mortgage,
is
exempt
under
michigan
law
from
an
annual
examination.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
they...
their
position
is
that
both
laws
that
we
append
to
our
brief,
both
laws
in
their
entirety,
are
preempted.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
correct.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
you
are
exactly
correct.
that's
the
michigan
regulatory--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--yes,
you
are
exactly
correct.
our
regulatory
framework
in
michigan
says
that
the
complaint
is
referred
to
the
appropriate
federal
agency,
and
only
if
that
complaint
is
not
being
adequately
pursued
does
the
commissioner
have
that
window
of
investigative
authority
for
her
to
pursue
it.
it
is
a
cooperative
type
of
statute.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
another
one
that--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--well,
in
a
sense,
in
our
statute,
the
commissioner
of
the
state
agency
is
able
to
investigate
if
the
complaint
referred
to
the
comptroller
has
not
been
adequately--
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
--no
situations
come
directly
to
mind.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
express
statutory
scheme
in
michigan.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
the
federal
rule
provides
that
the
operating...
the
state
chartered
operating
subs
are
to
be
treated
just
like
the
law
pertaining
to
the
parent
national
bank.
and
there
is
no
authority
from
congress
given
to
the
occ
that
kind
of
rule.
the
occ
only
has
the
authority
that
congress
gives
it,
either
through
a
preemptive
statute
or
through
the
dell
designation
of
preemptive
authority;
and
congress
has
not
given
them
that
kind
of
power.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i'm
not
defending
that
michigan
has
a
more
restrictive
scheme
or
that
michigan
law
in
any
way
incapacitates
or
significantly
interferes
with
the
business
of
banking.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
a
recognition
that
the
states
have
a
sovereign,
compelling
and
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
those
corporations
that
it
charters
and
that
do
business
within
its
borders.
and...
and
that
that
balance
should
be
respected.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
but
the...
but
the
key
point,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
may
have.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
the
key,
the
key
point
is
that
congress
has
distinguished
clearly
and
unequivocally
between
affiliates
and
national
banks;
but
it
has
not
included
affiliates
in
either
section
481
or
484
of
the
national
bank
act.
national
banks
are
not
synonymous
or
equivalent
to
the
state-chartered
operating
subsidiaries.
mr.
e.
john
blanchard
two
key
points.
first,
section
484
and
481
have
been
amended
subsequent
to
the
time
operating
subsidiaries
came
into
play.
congress
knew
of
operating
subsidiaries
when
it
amended
484
twice
in
the
1980s,
and
481
was
amended
four
times.
yet,
never
did
congress
insert
the
word
occ
in
488.
secondly,
the
gramm-leach-bliley
act
is
being
greatly
distorted.
the
same
terms
and
conditions
language
that
my
opponent
referred
to
was
meant
to
return
op
subs
only
to
the
authority
that
the
parent
bank
could
engage
in.
it
wasn't
preemptive
or
meant
to
preempt
the
states.
the
comptroller
had
issued
a
ruling,
34.f,
(f),
and
they
had
allowed
operating
subsidiaries
to
do
things
differently
from
the
parent
bank.
