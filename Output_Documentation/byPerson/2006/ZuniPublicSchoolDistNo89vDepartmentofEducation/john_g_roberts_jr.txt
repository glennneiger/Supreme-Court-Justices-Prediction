chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
05-1508,
zuni
public
school
district,
et
al.
vs.
department
of
education.
mr.
van
amberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
certain
about
the
hypothetical
but
you're
certain
about
the
statute,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't,
doesn't
subsection
b(ii)
address
outliers?
i
was
surprised
there
wasn't
more
discussion
of
that
in
the
briefing
and
maybe
it's,
it's
because
of
some
reason
i'm
unaware
of.
that
says
that
the
secretary
in
making
this
determination
can
take
into
account
particular
types
of
leas
where
there
is
extra,
additional
costs.
i
would
have
thought
for
example
if
you
had
a
very
small
lea
with
only
20
students
and
the
cost
is
particularly
high
because
you
don't
have
economies
of
scale,
that
you
haven't...
that
would,
could
be
knocked
out
for
that
reason.
is
that
not
how
that
works?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
case
that
says
"unambiguously
foreclosed"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
begin
with
an
argument
that
directly
cuts
against
your
position.
they
knew
how
to
do
it
under
the...
i
assume
you're
referring
to
the
education
finance
and
incentive
grant
program?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
did
it
there,
they
didn't
do
it
here.
to
me
that
suggests
the
opposite
of
the
inference
you're
trying
to
draw.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
they
did
not
say
in
this
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
for
different
purposes.
in
the
one
case,
in
this
act
we're
worried
about
an
extensive
federal
presence
that
has
an
effect
on
the
tax
base
available
for
schools
and
under
the
efig
program
it's
an
entirely
different
question
of
equalization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
let
me
ask
it
directly.
if
they
could
so
easily
just
say
we
incorporate
the
secretary's
regulation
in
efig,
why
didn't
they
do
it
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
instead
went
to
the
trouble
of
mimicking
part
of
the
regulation,
but
not
mimicking
the
appendix,
which
is
where
your
calculation
methodology
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask,
is
there
a
difference
legally
between
a
regulation
and
an
appendix
to
the
regulation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
say
"incorporated",
though.
what
it
did
was
it
took
the
language
and
it
did
not
take--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
efig
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
this
statute
the
regulation
says
look
to
the,
look
at
the
appendix.
congress
as
i
understood
when
it
enacted
our
statute,
it
took
language
from
the
regulation;
it
didn't
take
the
part
that
said
look
to
the
appendix.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
didn't
do
that
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
a
conceptual
difficulty,
and
it
may
be
my
limitations
with
the
way
you
do
it.
you
take
students
and
you
assign
a
per-pupil
number
to
each
individual
student.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
would
have
thought
the
per-pupil
concept
only
makes
sense
if
you're
dealing
with
leas.
they
have
a
per-pupil
number
because
they've
got
a
bunch
of
pupils.
you
take
individual
students,
and
you
know
for
example
in
that
school
district
you
don't
spend
the
same
amount
of
money
on
the
kindergartner
that
you
spend
on
the
eighth
grader.
and
yet,
you
give
the
kindergartner
a
per-pupil
number
and
the
eighth
grader
a
per-pupil
number
that
is
the
same.
it's
an
artificial
association.
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
per-pupil
numbers
when
you're
referring
to
the
leas
because
they
have
so
many
pupils,
they
get
so
much
money,
you
can
do
the
calculation.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say,
you
know,
john
smith
the
kindergartner
has
a
per-pupil
expenditure
of
a
thousand
dollars.
he
may
have
$200
and
the
eighth
grader
2,000,
so
why
are
you
creating
this
artificial
association
and
then
using,
using
that
methodology?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it's
only...
the
reason
is
to
rank
them
if
you
have
an
entity
that
has
a
swath
of
students,
the
district,
that's
the
way
it
should
be
ranked.
when
you're
ranking
it
by
pupils,
maybe
if
you
ranked
them
by
pupils
and
you
have
the
actual
numbers
of
course,
which
nobody
does,
your
methodology
would
make
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
because
it's
an
absurd
hypothetical.
what
is
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
is
the
smallest
number
of
districts,
what
is
the
smallest
number
of
school
districts
in
a
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
state
has
one
school
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the,
in
the
hypothetical
you
posed
why
couldn't
the
secretary
address
that
disparity
under
(b)(ii)?
in
other
words,
the
school
district
which
has
only
57
students,
it
seems
to
me
could
be
taken
out
of
the
calculation
under
(b)(ii),
and
then
you
would
be
dealing
only
with
more
representative
school
districts,
not
the
special
case
of
the
particularly
isolated
school
district
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
have
to
do
that?
why
do
you
have
to
do
it
first?
it
says
you
can
take
into
account
this...
extent
to
which
the
program
reflects
additional
costs
in
particular
districts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
the
statute
have
told
you,
though,
to,
to
disregard
pupils
according
to
the
ranking?
it
does
tell
you
to
disregard
leas,
which
suggests
the
ranking...
at
least
to
me,
that
the
ranking
ought
to
be
of
leas
and
not
pupils.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
your
office
had
answered
that
question
in
countless
briefs
where
it
tells
us
to
be
guided
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
not
some
unexpressed
intent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
manasevit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
it...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
see,
that's
my
conceptual
difficulty.
it
is
only
per
pupil
when
you're
dealing
with
an
aggregation
of
the
pupils.
if
you're
going
to
break
it
down
pupil
by
pupil,
which
is
what
you
do,
you
don't
have
a
per-pupil
number
associated
with
each
pupil.
you
have
a
number.
nobody
knows
what
it
is
because
nobody
knows
how
much
you
spend
on
each
individual.
we
know
how
much
you
give
to
this
district,
and
therefore,
the
district
has
a
per-pupil
number,
and
therefore,
i
would
have
thought
a
reference
to
per-pupil
numbers
suggests
you're
grouping
according
to
district.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
must
not
be
right,
because
otherwise
we
wouldn't
have
any
disparity
to
worry
about
equalization
in
the
first
place.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
you
think
congress,
if
congress
is
concerned
about
the,
in
this
provision,
about
the
impact
of
the
federal
presence,
and
your
reading
prevents
the
money
that
congress
meant
to
go
to
those
particular
districts
from
actually
reaching
the
districts,
i
mean,
wouldn't
we
be
inclined
to
read
it
the
way
that,
let
the
money
get
where
congress
meant
it
to
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
but
then
the
question
is
whether
the
state
can
consider
it
when
they're
figuring
out
how
much
money
to
give
it.
so
in
effect
it's
diverted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
van
amberg,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
