justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
at
the
end
of
the
line
here,
if
you
win
the
federal
money
will
go
to
your
two
districts,
whereas
if
the
other
side
wins
the
federal
money
will
go
to
the
state?
is
that
what
the
bottom
line
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
another
general
question.
if
it
were
true,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
case,
that
the
biggest
district
was
the
one
that
got
the
most
per
pupil
money...
the
two
biggest
districts
that
were
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum,
they
would
all
be
taken
out,
wouldn't
they,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
rather
basic
question?
what
if
i'm
convinced
that
your
opponent's
reading
is
really
only
the
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
but
i'm
also
convinced
by
you
that
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
what
should
i
do?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
no.
accept,
accept
my
premises.
what
do
you
think
i
should
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
absurd,
it's
just,
i
would
measure
it
by
what
congress
actually
intended.
assume
there
two
permissible
readings,
and
two...
both
of
them
make
sense.
and
i'm
convinced,
assume
i'm
convinced
by
you,
that
they
really
intended
to
perpetuate
the
prior
method
of
procedure.
may
i
take
that,
may
i
come
to
that
result
even
though
i
think
the
language
really
says
exactly
what
your
opponent
says
it
says?
