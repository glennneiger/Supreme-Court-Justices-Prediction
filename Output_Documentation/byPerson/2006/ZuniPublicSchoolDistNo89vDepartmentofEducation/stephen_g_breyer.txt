justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
do
you
distribute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
distribute?
i
mean,
i
agree
you
have
a,
some
kind
of,
let's
put
something
on
cards,
so
you
have
thousands
of
cards
and
each
one
has
a
number
on
it.
what
are
you
distributing...
the
cards?
are
you,
are
you...
what's
distribute...
a
5th
percentile
refers
to
some
kind
of
distribution.
what's
it
a
distribution
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
a...
like
a
set
of
things
that
you're
distributing,
what
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
take
all
the...
there
is
a
set
of
numbers,
each
number
is
a
different
number
and
the
characteristic
of
each
number
is
there
some
school
district
that
spends
per,
or
takes
in
per
pupil,
revenue
equal
to
that
number.
so
we
write
each
one
on
a
card.
is
that
what
we're,
is
that
our
distribution?
we
have
like,
let's
say
we
have
a,
a
thousand
cards.
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
not,
i'm
saying
what
do
you
think
it
has
to
be?
what
do
you
think
it
should
be?
what
are,
what
is
it
we
are
distributing?
a
simple
question,
i
guess,
for
a
statistician.
i
unfortunately
am
not
one
and
can't
find
one,
so
i
have
no
idea
what
this
statute
means.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
value.
i
want
to
know
what
i'm
distributing.
and
if
you
don't
know
i
would
say
that
this
is,
i
have
never
seen
a
case
so
much
better
fitted
for
relying
on
the
views
of
an
agency.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
how--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
so
in
other
words
we
are
distributing
those
cards,
it's
a
set
of
numbers?
if
you're
certain,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
this
statute
is
not
clear
as
to
what
it
is
you're
distributing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
i
thought
not.
is
there
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah...
that...
right.
but
i
unfortunately
don't
know
enough
about
this
subject,
so
i
thought,
not
being
an
expert
on
it,
that
when
you
referred
to
a
percentile,
you
have
some
group
of
things,
a
set
of
things
that's
being
distributed
in
a
certain
order
and
there
is
a
top
of
that
and
a
bottom
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that's
what
percentile
refers
to,
i
just
want
to
know
what
those
things
are
that
are
being
distributed.
and...
and
that's
where
i
find
the
ambiguity.
and
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
i
guess
we
are
going
to
take
the
view
of
the
agency
at
least
as
i
understand
it.
so...
so
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
the
statute
say
you
have
to
do
it
that
way?
it
has
to
be
the
group
that's
distributed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
could
do
it
that
way
and
the
reason
the
government,
i
think,
says
that
you
shouldn't
do
it
that
way
is
that
it
would
produce
an
absurd
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
the
object
of
the
statute
is
to
catch
the
outliers.
and
if
you,
for
example,
had
one
giant
school
district
like
new
york
city
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
list
and
another
giant
school
district
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
you
would
cut
those
two
out,
and
you
might
have
cut
out
half
the
pupils
in
the
whole
state,
and
those
wouldn't
be
outliers
would
they?
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it,
it
eliminates
26
school
districts
but
those
26
school
districts
account
for
5
percent
or
10
percent
of
the
pupils.
and
i
guess
what
we
are
interested
in
here
is
not
school
districts;
they
are
not
a
thing...
they
are
a
thing
of
a
kind,
but
we
are
interested
in
students,
real
people
who
get
money.
and
so
that
it,
that
it...
it
eliminates
26
percent
of
the
school
districts
would
see,
to
be
a
good
thing,
not
a
bad
thing,
because
what
we
are
really
interested
in
are
the
pupils
and
it
keeps
in
90
percent
of
the
pupils.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
right.
i
wouldn't
think
that
was
a
problem.
but
what
about
justice
stevens'
question.
there
are
20
districts
in
our
state...
it's
exaggerated,
let
me
exaggerate
it...
and
the
rich
district
has
20,
has
a
quarter
of
the
students,
and
the
poor
district
has
another
quarter.
so
our
outliers
in
that
situation
which
we're
eliminating
from
our
calculation
are
the
rich
district
and
the
poor
district.
one's
at
the
top,
one's
at
the
bottom.
and
now
we're
left
with
18
districts
to
figure
out
whether
they're
equalized.
but
those
18
districts
account
for
less
than
half
or
about
half
of
all
the
students.
that's
the
problem.
it
seems
that
isn't
very
representative
and
we're
trying
to
get
representativeness.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
if
the
language
doesn't
permit
it
you
can't
do
it,
they
can't,
and
you
win.
but
if
the
language
does
permit
it,
the
reason...
you
have
to
stretch
the
language,
i
suspect,
in
my
view
to
get
to
the
government's
result.
it
might
just
barely
permit
it.
but
one
of
the
things
on
their
side
is
that
if
we
take
your
view
it
produces
an
absurd
result,
because
of
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
because
there
is
such
variation
in
the
number
of
pupils
among
school
districts
in
different
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
it...
why
doesn't
absolutely
compel
it?
where
is
the
ambiguity,
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
5th
percentile
of
such
per-pupil
expenditure.
and
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now
how
are
you
going
to
get
that
so
it
doesn't
just
say
just
list
cards
with
per-pupil
expenditure
on
it,
different
ones
and
take
the
top
five?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
a
lot
of
cards
that
have
the
same
cards
that
have
the
same
number?
you
have
a
lot--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why,
why
don't
you
take
the
top
five
where
we
have
10
percent
of
the
students,
let's
take
the
second
five
and
they
happens
to
have
the
same
number
on
the
card
as
the
first
five,
and
why
don't
they
fall
in
the
first
5
percent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
forget
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
include
the
words
per-pupil
revenue
for
each
pupil,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
want
to
say
it,
per-pupil
revenue
attached
to
each
pupil?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
how
do
you
want
to
say
it
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
attached
to
each
pupil?
you
say
the
word
such
is
broad
enough
to
include
per-pupil
revenue
as
attached
to
each
pupil?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
know
where
to
look
to
discover
if
you're
right
or
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
statistical
text
that
you
could
look
at
to
see
it
that's
the
way
people
use
the
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
second
case,
i
hope
you
thought
that
one
was
technical.
this
one
is
called
zuni
school
district
versus
the
department
of
education.
now,
there
is
a
federal
statute
again
and
what
this
federal
statute
says
is,
it
says
that
“if
in
fact
there
are
a
lot
of
costs
that
the
federal
government
is
making
a
local
school
district
incur.”
for
example
maybe
there
is
a
lot
of
federal
land
nearby
or
maybe
there
is
an
army-base
and
they
have
to
educate
the
children.
so,
the
federal
government
has
made
it
harder
for
the
local
school
district
to
raise
money
for
its
expenses
or
to
pay
money
for
the
education.
will
then
the
federal
government
will
give
them
some
money
they
will
write
them
a
check,
say,
it
was
for
a
million
dollars.
well,
the
federal
government
says
in
this
statute
now
if
we
give
you
the
million
dollars
to
the
school
district
for
this,
the
state
cannot
just
take
the
million
away
by
reducing
their
own
aid
to
the
school
district
by
a
million;
they
can’t
do
that.
but,
then
someone
worked
out
that
suppose
they
have
what’s
called
an
equalization
program
in
the
state
where
they
try
to
keep
per-pupil
expenditure
about
the
same
in
all
the
school
districts,
suddenly,
there’ll
be
a
school
district
with
an
extra
million
dollars
and
that
might
make
them
the
riches.
so,
they
should
be
able
to
offset
in
that
situation
and
so
they
wrote
the
statute
to
say
but,
in
that
situation
they
can
offset
provided
there
is
an
equalization
program.
well,
what’s
an
equalization
program?
so,
the
statute
sets
up
a
method
for
measuring
that
and
it
says
basically
the
method
consists
of
list
all
the
school
districts
in
order
of
per-pupil
expenditure,
look
at
the
top
one,
look
at
the
bottom
one
and
if
it’s
less
than
25%
difference
in
what
they’re
spending
per-pupil
then
you’ve
got
an
equalization
program.
so
far
so
good
but
then
they
add
an
instruction,
the
added
instruction
is
to
say
when
you
make
that
list
don’t
put
in
the
outliers,
well,
what’s
an
outlier?
an
outlier
and
this
is
what’s
called
the
disregard
instruction,
says
that,
when
comparing
the
highest
and
lowest
per-pupil
expenditures
the
“secretary
shall
disregard
school
districts
with
per-pupil
expenditures
above
the
95th
percentile
or
below
the
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures.”
now,
we
get
to
the
question
in
the
case.
when
the
secretary
of
education
was
administering
this
statute
he
would
lineup
all
the
school
districts
and
then
when
you
try
to
see
what
to
disregard,
he
looked
to
the
top
5%
of
pupils
by
number
and
pupils
by
bottom,
that’s
the
top
and
the
bottom.
now,
some
school
districts
have
worked
out
they’re
going
to
get
more
money
if
they
say,
you
shouldn’t
have
done
that,
what
you’re
supposed
to
do
is
disregard
5%
of
the
school
districts,
not
5%
of
the
pupils.
well,
which
should
it
be?
the
secretary
says,
i
want
to
tell
you
two
things,
first,
we’ve
done
it
my
way,
pupils
for
35
years
now,
i
wrote
this
statute
in
draft
and
sent
it
to
congress
and
there
are
no
exceptions
and
i
have
excellent
reasons.
my
reason
of
course
is
imagine
that
you
had
a
school
district,
a
state
would
say
20
school
districts
and
suppose
that
of
the
20.
for
example,
two
of
them
accounted
for
half
of
the
pupils
in
the
state,
the
rest
were
rural,
and
suppose
that
two
one
was
at
the
top
and
one
was
at
the
bottom,
well,
5%
of
school
districts,
you’ll
be
disregarding
half
of
the
pupils,
those
who
are
not
outliers.
so,
i
want
to
do
it
my
way
by
pupils,
it
makes
sense
historically,
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
purpose
but
what
about
the
language.
at
this
point,
all
of
us
i
think,
all
nine
of
us
worked
out
that
that
language
is
a
little
difficult.
so,
we’ve
gone
into
the
language
in
depth
in
the
opinion
for
those
who
are
interested
you
can
read
about
that
language
and
five
of
us,
a
majority
in
the
opinion
i
am
announcing
conclude
that
the
language
permits
the
secretary’s
interpretation.
four
of
us
conclude
that
it
doesn’t
and
they
dissent.
well,
by
this
greater
than
before
so
we
favor
the
secretary
in
our
holding
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
stevens
has
written
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
written
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
alito
has
joined.
justice
scalia
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined
and
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined
as
to
part
i.
justice
souter
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion.
