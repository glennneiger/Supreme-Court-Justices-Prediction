justice

before
you
get
into
the
substance
let's...
let's
finish
with
this,
this
problem,
whether
it
was
indeed
the
other
secretary's
own
bill.
was
the
secretary
who
proposed
the...
the
'94
legislation,
the
same
secretary
who
had
promulgated
the
prior
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
prior
regulations
were
promulgated
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness,
that's
a
long
time
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
a
different
secretary
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
same
secretary...
that
the
secretary
continued
to
have
the
same
view
of
what
was
proper,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed
he
could
have
copied
the
regulations
that
were
on
the
book
and
just
put
them
in
the
statute,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
the
same
secretary,
by
the
way,
as
the
secretary
who
issued
the
new
regulation,
the
same
secretary
that
was
in
office
when
the
new
legislation
had
been
proposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
why
would
the--
secretary,
if
indeed
it
was
his
bill,
why
would
he
deprive
himself
of
the
power
to
decide
what
the
formula
should
be?
which
is
the
power
he
had
before.
i
mean,
one
must
think
that
there
must
have
been
some
pressures
from
elsewhere
when
the
secretary
goes
in
and
says
take
some
power
away
from
me,
please.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
thought
you
said
that
you
did
know
what
it
was.
i
thought
you
simply
quoted
the
statute,
the
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state.
that's
what's
being
distributed.
justice
antonin
scalia
such
revenues
or
expenditures
in
the
state
consist
of,
the
word
"such"
obviously
refers
you
back
to
some
prior
reference
to
revenues
in
the
state,
and
that
prior
reference
in
subsection
a
is
a
reference
to
district
by
district,
not
pupil
by
pupil.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
problem
was
disparity
in
school
districts.
since
much
of
the
funding
for
education
is
local
funding,
in
some
places
there
are
very
rich
school
districts
and
very,
very
poor,
poor
school
districts.
and
i
thought
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
make
sure
that
there
is
not
an
enormous
disparity,
not
pupil
to
pupil
but
district
to
district.
it
makes
perfect
sense,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
srinivasan,
you
don't
want
us
to
stretch
the
language,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
wouldn't
urge
us
to
do
either,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
different
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
for
different
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still
think
it
cuts
against
you
rather
than
for
you,
the
fact
that
they
could
have
done
the
same
thing
here
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
srinivasan,
if
we
could
come
to
the,
to
the
text
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
don't
understand
about
the
government's
position
is
why
you
use
this,
this
per
pupil
theory
for
purposes
of
(b),
but
don't
use
it
for
purposes
of
(a).
you,
you
don't...
in
the
major
computation
portions,
namely
for
purposes
of
paragraph
1,
a
program
of
state
aid
equalizes
expenditures
among
local
expenditures,
if
in
the
second
fiscal
year
is
made
the
amount
of
per
pupil
expenditures
made
by
or
per
pupil
revenue
available
to,
you
do
it
agency
by
agency,
don't
you?
you
don't
apply
this,
you
know,
it
depends
on
how
many
pupils
in
each
agency.
why
don't
you
do
for
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
comes
to
the
same,
but
the
fact
remains
you
don't
use
that
methodology
in
a,
because
you
don't
think
the
language
requires
that
methodology.
and
it
is
the
same
language
in
b.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
purpose
would
be
to
follow
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
if
you
think
that
the
language
in
b
requires
this
kind
of
an
approach
you
should
take
the
same
approach
in
a,
especially
if
it
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
such
be...
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues.
that
refers
back
to
local
educational
agencies
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues.
it's
referring
you
back
not
to
the
totality
of
students
but
to,
to
agencies
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
still
have
a
church
of
the
holy
trinity
team
over
there
somewhere,
don't
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
really
don't
care
what
the
secretary
thought
he
was
doing.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
ask
the
question,
what
would
a
member
of
congress
who
voted
on
this
thing
have
thought
he
was
voting
for,
who
had,
you
know,
didn't
have
this
history
you're
giving
us.
and
more
importantly,
what
would
a
citizen
to
whom
this
language
is
promulgated
think
the
language
means?
i
don't
care
what
the
secretary
had
in
the
back
of
his
mind.
why
should
that
make
any
difference
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you've
got
to
find
out
what
"such"
refers
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked...
i
asked
the
government.
why
don't
you,
if
this
is
a
natural
reading,
why
don't
you
apply
it
to,
to
2.a?
you
don't
even
think
of
doing
that
in--
2.a.
in
2.a
you
just
look
at
the
individual
agency,
but
it's
the
same
language
in
2.a.
