mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
stretch
the
language,
justice
scalia.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
depends
on
what--
you
mean
by
stretch.
[laughter]
the
question,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
secretary's
formula
is
unambiguously
foreclosed
by
the
statutory
test,
not
whether
it's
the
better
reading,
but
whether
it's
unambiguously
foreclosed.
and
we
happen
to
think
it's
the
better
reading,
but
we
certainly
think
it's
not
unambiguously
foreclosed.
and
maybe
the
clearest
indication
that
congress
did
not
unambiguously
foreclose
the
secretary's
methodology--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
brand
x
says
that,
but
it's
a
characterization
of
the
step
one
inquiry
under
chevron.
and
we
can
use
"foreclosed"
if
you
like,
your
honor.
but
the
clearest
indication
that
the
statute
does
not
foreclose
the
secretary's
methodology
is
a
provision
that
i
think
hasn't
been
addressed
thus
far
in
the
argument
and
that's
that
in
the
very
same
act
in
congress
in
which
congress
enacted
section
7709,
the
provision
at
issue
here,
congress
also
explicitly
endorsed
and
incorporated
the
secretary's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
am.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect.
there
are
two
education
finance
incentive
grant
program,
or
efig,
provisions
that
we
identified
in
the
briefs
and
one
of
them
i
would
acknowledge
is
susceptible
to
that
line
of
argument,
although
i
don't
think
it's
persuasive.
but
it's
the
other
one
that
i'm
focusing
on,
and
what
the
other
one
does
is
to
explicitly
incorporate
the
secretary's
regulations
and
so
what
congress
said
in
1994
is
that
for
purposes--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--they
didn't,
but
i
think
it
would
be
very
odd
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intention
on
one
hand
to
say,
we
like
your
regulation,
so
much
so
that
we
want
to
use
it
and
we
want
you
to
continue
to
use
it
for
purposes
of
the
efig
program--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--they're
not--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--they're
not
different
purposes
at
all,
justice
scalia,
with
respect.
they're
the
exact
same
purpose.
in
both
programs
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
an
assessment
of
the
extent
to
which
education
expenditures
were
equalized
in
a
state
among
school
districts.
they're
the
very
same
purpose.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
at
that
level
of
generality
you
might
be
right,
but
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
equalization
provisions
of
both
of
those
acts
the
purpose
is
exactly
the
same.
in
impact
aid,
just
like
in
efig,
the
question
is
to
what
extent
has
the
state
equalized
expenditures
across
school
districts.
it's
the
very
same
question.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
they
didn't
mimic
it.
they
incorporated
it.
and
so
far
as
the
argument
is
that
they
incorporated
just
the
regulation
qua
regulation
and
not
the
appendix
to
the
regulation,
i
don't
think
that
that
argument
can
be
squared
with
the
statutory
text
or
the
regulatory
text.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
at
least
not
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
where
the
regulation
by
its
own
terms
incorporates
the
appendix.
and
so
when
congress
incorporated
the
regulation
it
necessarily
incorporated
the
appendix.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
text
of
the
statute
in
1994
is
set
forth
at
the
top
of
page
30
of
the
government's
brief,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
second
line
of
page
30
and
what
congress
said
in
the
efig
statute
in
1994,
again
in
the
very
same
act
that
enacted
this
language--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--in
the
efig
statute.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
didn't
take
the
part
that
said
look
to
the
appendix
because
i
don't
know
that
that
would
have
been
a
sensible
thing
to
do
when
you're
enacting
a
statute.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
when
congress
in
the
efig
statute
incorporated
the
regulation
it
specifically
referred
to
the
regulation
that
the
secretary
had
in
place
at
that
time.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
didn't
do
that
here,
but
it
didn't
have
to.
it
makes
sense--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
let
me
just
make
one
more
point
on
this,
your
honor,
and
then
i'll
move
to
the
text
of
section
7709,
because
i
do
think
that
this
point
has
a
great
deal
of
force.
the
reason
that
congress
would
have
incorporated
the
regulation
specifically
in
efig
but
not
in
impact
aid
is
because
we're
dealing
with
an
impact
aid
regulation.
so
the
secretary
ordinarily
wouldn't
have
thought
that
he
should
apply
the
impact
aid
regulation
for
purposes
of
efig
unless
congress
told
him
to
do
that
and
that's
what
congress
did.
but
with
respect
to
impact
aid,
there's
no
reason
to
incorporate
the
regulation.
the
regulation
already
existed,
and
the
question
is
did
congress
in
this
act
foreclose
the
secretary
from
continuing
to
apply
that
longstanding
regulatory
methodology.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
congress
really
wanted
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
if
you
look
at
2(a),
your
honor
what
that
says
is
that
the
disparity,
the
disparity
standard
at
its
broadest
level
deals
with
whether
the
per-pupil
revenues
for
the
highest
ranked
local
educational
agency
exceeds
the
per
pupil
revenues
for
the
lowest
one
by
25
percent.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
make
no
difference
if
you
take
into
account
pupils
for
that
part
of
the
analysis,
and
here's
the
reason
why.
when
you
take
into
account
pupils
with
respect
to
a
local
educational
agency
and
you
weight
the
local,
the
figure
by
the
number
of
pupils
served
by
the
local
educational
agency,
the
per
pupil
figure
that
you're
going
to
attach
to
each
of
those
individual
pupils
is
the
same.
it's
the
same
per
pupil
figure
for
each
one.
it's
just
that
you
multiply
it
by
the
number
of
pupils.
so
for
purposes
of
this
part
of
the
statute,
where
you're
comparing
the
highest
to
the
lowest,
whether
you
took
into
account
the
number
of
pupils
or
not
you'd
still
be
dealing
with
the
same
two
figures.
you'd
be
dealing
with
a
figure
that
applies
to
the
highest
ranked
local
educational
agency
and
you'd
be
dealing
with
a
figure
that
applies
to
the
lowest
ranked
local
educational
agency.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
there
would
be...
i
don't
know
that
we
use
one
or
the
other.
it's
just
that
there
would
be
absolutely
no
purpose
served
by
using
pupils
with
respect
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
no;
especially
because
it
makes
no
difference,
because
with
respect
to
the
b
part
of
it,
the
95th
and
5th
percentile
exclusions,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
you
take
into
account--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--effectively.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it's
an
approximation
to
be
sure,
and
per-pupil
revenues
by
definition
deal
with
approximations
across
the
swath
of
students
that
are
covered
by
local
educational
agencies.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
what
we're
really
doing,
your
honor,
is
weighting
each
figure
by
the
amount
of
pupils
in
the
school
district,
and
the
reason
we're
doing
that
is
to
get
a
more
accurate
picture
of
the
extent
to
which
any
one
school
district's
per-pupil
revenue
figure
contributes
to
the
overall
revenue
pictures
in
the
state.
and
if
i
could
use
one
example
which
i
think
might
help
to
crystallize
why
it's
necessary
to
do
this
sort
of
weighting
and
why
education
finance
practitioners
routinely
prescribe
that
you
have
to
do
this
sort
of
weighting
in
order
to
avoid
distorted
results,
if
you
consider
the
example
of
a
state
that
has
two
school
districts,
and
i'll
use
real
examples
from
new
mexico.
one
would
be
the
district
that
has
the
highest
per-pupil
revenues
in
the
state,
the
mosquero
district,
in
which
there's
57
pupils.
and
the
other
would
be
the
albuquerque
school
district,
the
largest
school
district
in
the
state,
which
serves
84,000
pupils.
now
the
per-pupil
revenues
for
albuquerque
are
roughly
$3,000
and
the
per-pupil
revenues
for
mosquero,
the
smaller
school
district,
are
roughly
$7,000.
and
if
you
imagine
a
state
that
consists
of
just
those
two
districts,
and
you
ask
the
question
to
pair
with
the
statutory
language,
what
is
the
50th
percentile,
and
i'll
use
50th
just
for
ease
of
analysis,
what
is
the
50th
percentile
of
such
per-pupil
revenues
in
the
state?
one
answer
would
be
that
you
take
the
number
for
mosquero,
the
7,000
and
you
take
the
number
for
albuquerque,
the
3,000,
you
split
the
difference
and
you
say
the
50th
percentile
of
per-pupil
revenues
in
the
state
is
$5,000.
but
i
think
that
would
present
a
very
misleading
picture
of
what's
actually
going
on
in
the
state.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't...
i...
it
is
not--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--one.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
hawaii.
hawaii
has
one
which
is
a
special
case
but
there
are
states
that
have
a
relatively
small
number
of
school
districts.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
two
points
on
(b)(ii),
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that
by...
by
the
statutory
text,
(b)(ii)
is
over
and
above
what
you
do
in
(b)(i,
).
the
95th
and
5th
percentiles
exclusions.
so
you
first
have
to
do
that.
but
the
more
relevant
point--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
my
point
is
simply
that
under
(b)(i)
the
statute
says
the
secretary
shall
disregard
local
education
agencies
that
are
above
the
95th
and
below
the
5th
percentile.
so
i
think
the
secretary
has
to
do
that.
now
(b)(ii)
in
some
sense
could
be
seen
as
an
additional
option
for
the
secretary
over
and
above
the
exclusion,
but
there
is
a
more
fundamental
point
which
is
that
with
(b)(ii),
it
says
take
into
account
the
extent
to
which
a
program
of
state
aid
reflects
the
additional
costs.
and
so
what
that
does
is
a
piggyback
on
the
way
that
the
state
approaches
the
situation.
so
this,
as...
this
provision
as
the
secretary
understands
it
allows
it
to
give
effect
to
a
state
that
gives
effect
to
those
sorts
of
considerations,
but
it's
not
an
independent
grant
of
authority
for
the
secretary
himself
to
take
those
considerations
into
account.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
absolutely
not.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure,
i
will.
it's
at
page
4a
of
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief,
b...
(b)(i).
and
what
the
text
says
is
disregard
local
educational
agencies
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues
above
the
59th
percentile
or
below
the
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
now
one
point
i
make--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
you
identify
the
agencies
to
be
disregarded
by
first
identifying
the
59th
and
5th
percentiles
of
per-pupil
revenues
in
the
state.
and
then
you
disregard--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes,
but...
and...
but
the
critical
test
is
the
95th
percentile
and
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
is.
i
mean
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
per-pupil
revenues
or
expenditure
figures
that
lie
on
the
spectrum
are
associated
with
the
local
educational
agencies.
that's
how--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
think
so.
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's
true
that
each
local
education
agency
has
a
per-pupil
expenditure
or
revenue.
but
the
critical
part
of
the
statute
which
has
59th
percentile
or
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
doesn't
foreclose
weighting.
and
i
think
the
point
that
justice
alito
made
bears,
which
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
we...
two
parts
to
the
answer,
justice
souter.
first
the
secretary's
formulation,
no
less
than
petitioner's
formulation,
does
disregard
local
educational
agencies
with
per-pupil
revenues
above
the
95th
and
5th
percentiles.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
where
we
disagree
is
in
identifying
the
95th
exactly.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
exactly.
and
i'd...
exactly.
and
i'd
reiterate
the
point
that
justice
alito
made
earlier,
which
is
that
congress
could
have
compelled
the
approach
that
petitioners
compelled...
contend,
if
it
would
have
said--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
there
are
two
different
ways
of
ranking
the
leas.
one
is
to
take
the
per-pupil
revenues
associated
with
each
lea
and
simply
take
that
list
into
account.
another
is
to
take
the
same
list
but
then
weight
it
by
the
number
of
pupils
in
each
lea.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
nothing
in
the
statute
forecloses
that
approach.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
the
text
refers
to
the
95th
and
5th
percentiles
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state,
and
the
list
that
includes
the
weighting
does
represent
a
list
of
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
and
i
don't,
i
don't
dispute
that
the
per-pupil
revenue
figures
belong
to
a
local
educational
agency.
but
again
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
take
into
account
the
relative
extent
to
which
a
particular
school
district
contributes
to
the
overall
state
picture,
and
the
way
you
do
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it
is,
it
is
a
ranking
of
leas
in
the
first
instance
and
then
it's,
each
of
those
lea
figures
is
weighted
by
the
number
of
pupils
the
way
we
do
it,
and
we
do
end
up
disregarding
leas.
but
as
justice
souter
pointed
out
the
first
step
is
identifying
the
5th
and
95th
percentiles,
and
on
that
step
we
take
into
account
the
number
of
pupils.
it's
only
at
that
step
that
we
take
into
account
the
number
of
pupils.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
nothing
in
the
statute
forecloses
that.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
one
way
or
another
i
think
your
should
rule
in
our
favor.
[laughter]
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
in
that
situation
you
sort
of
have
the
sliding
scale
that
we
often
confront
with
textual
analysis.
and
if
you
really
think
that
congress
would
have
compelled
an
absurd
result,
and
i
think
it
does
verge
on
that,
then
you
would--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
if
the
language
absolutely
unambiguously
compels
that
reading,
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
difficult
position.
but
i
don't
think
it
goes,
goes
to
that
degree.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
that's
why
i
said,
if
you
think
that
the
statute
unambiguously
actually
compels
that
reading,
then
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
a
position.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
says--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
well
it's
just
the
number
of
cards,
ultimately,
under
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
have
the
same
cards,
we
just
have...
they
have
the
numbers,
exactly.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's
the
same
cards
with
the
same
numbers.
we
just
add
more
cards
in
order
to
reflect
the
extent
to
which
each
lea
contributes
to
the
overall
picture.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sorry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
as
we
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
there
was
some
education
finance
experts
that
suggested
there
would
be
no
reason
to
retain
the
exclusion
at
the
bottom
of
the
range,
and
i
think
that's
because
when
you
have
low
per-pupil
revenues
there
is
a
reason
not
to
exclude
those
figures.
but
the
important
point
is
the
material
important
part
of
the
language,
which
is
95th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state,
is
exactly
what
the
secretary
proposed
and
the
secretary
of
course
wouldn't
have
curtailed
his
own
discretion
to
continue
the
same
methodology
that
he
had
long
had
in
place.
thank
you.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
in
2.a,
2.a
calls
for
a
different
type
of
comparison.
and
i
also
note
that
in--
2.a
it
refers
to
percent
instead
of
percentile,
which
refers
to
two
numbers
being
compared.
percentile
refers
to
an
entire
ranking
of
value,
so
the
processes
are
somewhat
different.
now
we're
not,
i'm
not
contending
that
this
statute
is
absolutely
clear
and
a
model
of
draftsmanship,
but
certainly
the
meaning
of
95th
percentile
or
5th
percentile
of
such
expenditures
or
revenues
is
a
broad
enough
term.
