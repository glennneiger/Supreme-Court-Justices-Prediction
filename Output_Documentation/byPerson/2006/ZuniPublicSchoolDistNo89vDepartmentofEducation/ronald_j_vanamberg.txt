mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1994,
congress
enacted
the
equalization
formula
under
the
impact
aid
act.
it
did
so
clearly
and
decisively,
and
described
a
methodology
which
was
unambiguous,
was
self
contained,
reflected
a
recognized
statistical
standard,
and
assisted
in
actually
promulgating...
and...
the
intent
of
the
impact
aid
act,
which
is
to
benefit
impacted
local
educational
agencies
or
school
districts
and
not
fund
the
general
educational
program
of
the
states.
in
so
doing,
congress
removed
from
the
secretary
the
previously
delegated
authority
to
establish
by
regulation
the
equalization
formula.
the
secretary
in
turn
in
1996,
in
enacting
his
regulations
in
response
to
the
1994
legislation,
disavowed
that
he
was
engaging
in
any
rulemaking
or
in
fact
in
any
interpretations
of
statutes.
instead,
the
secretary
sought
and
announced
that
he
was
proceeding
under
an
exception
to
the
public
notice
and
comment
laws,
5
u.s.c.
553(b),
by
stating
that
his
regulations
merely
reflected
changes
in
legislation,
refining
regulatory
language.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
yes.
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg...
ginsburg.
those
were
essentially,
except
for
a
few
words
here
and
there,
those
were
the
same
regulations.
but
they
were
in
response
to
a
congressional
directive
back
in
1974
that
the
secretary
is
to
create
the
equalization
formula.
in
1994,
congress
came
in
with
legislation
and
established
that
formula.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
the
contention
is
made
that
this
545-page
omnibus
education
bill--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--i
don't
think
we
know
exactly
who
it
was
drafted
by.
i
think
there
is...
there
is
some
references
in
the
congressional...
congressional
record
that
this
is
an
administration
bill.
but
i
would,
i
would
like
to
respond,
justice
ginsburg,
based
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
the
secretary's
bill.
under
the
statutory
formula,
the
language
is
clear
that
what
is
disregarded
in...
in
ranking
leas
and
eliminating
percentiles
of
leas
is
those
leas
which
fall
above
the
95th
percentile--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--no.
this--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--the
former
regulations
were
promulgated
in
1976.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
that's
a
long
time.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
and
a
different
agency.
there
wasn't
even--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--we
view
that
it
did
not
and,
and
also,
justice
scalia
and
justice
ginsburg,
we
also
view
that
if
this
was
the
chief
educational
officer
of
the
federal
government,
he
was
more
than
capable
of
developing
a
statute
which
reflected
his
methodology
of--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--well,
even
in
the
same
act,
your
honor,
under
when
they
had
the
efig
statute,
there
congress
was
able
to
reference
the
regulations
of
the
secretary.
they
didn't
do
so
when
they
were,
when
they
enacted
the
impact
aid
part
of
it.
so--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--he
didn't...
if
i
could,
your
honor,
he
did
not
retain
the
second
regulation.
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
new
regulation
which
was
promulgated
by
the
secretary
because
the
impact
aid
act
had
been
repealed--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--and
re-enacted.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
no.
but
it--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--the
new
legislation
was
'94.
secretary
enacted
it
in
'96.
i
think
it
probably
was.
i...
i...
it
was
the
same
administration.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
that,
and
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
not
a,
a
usual
event
where
an
administration
intentionally
disgorges
from
itself
its
own
authority.
and,
and
i
would
also
point
out
the
fact
that
again,
there
is
a
dramatic
difference
between
what,
what
the
statute
proposed
and,
and
the
methodology
described
in
the
regulation.
and
what's,
what's
very
significant
is
if
you
go
back
to
1976
when
the
original
regulation
was
promulgated,
there
was
a
debate
that
went
on
in
the
public
notice
and
comment
portion
of
these
proceedings
where
they
discussed
whether
you
eliminate
percentile
of
leas
directly
or
whether
you
add
this
extra
step
of
eliminating
percentage,
percentages
of
pupils
and
then
eliminating
leas
as
these
pupils
are
eliminated.
i
mean,
it's
a
totally
different
process,
totally
different
philosophy
behind
them
and
as
we
can
see
in
this
particular
case,
in
new
mexico
and
in
alaska,
totally
different
results.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
justice
alito,
i,
i
think
what
you,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
and
the
reason
is
that
if
you,
in
order
to
run
a
percentile
calculation
you
need
units
against
which
to
run
that,
and
then
you
need
these,
an
identified
set
of
variable
standards
such
as
they
provided
here,
the
average
per
pupil
expenditures
of
each
set
of
these
leas
or
districts.
so
you
rank
the,
the
leas.
you've
got
the
variable
values
and
then
it,
it's,
the
statute
provides
that
you
find
that
you
eliminate
those
leas
which
are
above
the
95th
percentile.
and
then
if
you
go
back
to
what
95th
percentile
of
the
revenues
and
expenditures
of
the
leas
in
the
state.
it's
a
very
similar
process
for--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--pardon?
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
it's
the
distribution
of
the
percent
of
the,
what
is--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--like
a
thing.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
the
thing
that
you're
running
the
percentile
against
is
the
total
number
of,
of
expenditures
and
revenues
in
the
state.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
you
know,
in
new
mexico's
case
you
have--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--well,
the,
the...
the
value
against
which--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--yes,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--that,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
i'm
sorry,
justice...
i'm...
breyer;
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
understanding--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--the
question.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
i'm
certain
about
the
statute.
you're
provided
the
variable
values
that
are
attributed
to
each
of
the
leas;
you
rank
them;
and
you
provide
a
percentile.
it's
a
methodology
which
was
described
in
1976.
it's
a
methodology
employed
every
day
in
ranking
students
and
schools.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
all
right.
and,
and
i
think
i
understand
the
question
now,
justice
breyer.
thank
you.
the
units
that
are
ranked
or
distributed
are
the
leas
or
the
school
districts.
and
they
are
ranked
in
order
of
their
per
pupil
expenditures
and
revenues.
those
are
the
units
and
the
component
parts
of
this
calculation
that
are
provided
for
us
by
congress.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
it's
my
understanding
under...
under
brown
and
williamson
is
if
congress
speaks
to
an
issue,
congress
is
to
be
obeyed.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
this
type
of
a
methodology.
and
this
is
the
one
that
congress
chose.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
all
right.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
and
you
have
a
similar
infirmity
associated
with
the
other
methodology.
that
is,
if
you
have
a
number
of
leas
which
are
small
in
numbers,
as
in
new
mexico,
particularly
if
you
had
a
number
of
small
leas
at
the
bottom,
which
is
i
think
a
huge
problem
policy
wise,
you
were
to
cut
them
out
and
let
them
to
float
off
in
their
poverty.
i
think,
i
can
understand
where
there
is--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--yes.
and
this
is
the,
the
whole
problem,
that
we
can
argue
philosophically
how
whether
congress's
methodology
or
the
secretary's
methodology
is
better,
but
the
backdrop
of
this
is
that
the,
the
statute
and
also
the
regulation
allows
for
school,
for
the
states
to
back
out
all
these
disequalizing
expenditures
so
that
you,
you
make
an
adjustment
to
more
or
less
end
up
with
a
baseline
per
pupil
expenditure.
and
there
is
really
no
reason
after
you
do
that
for
having
a
wide
disparity,
even
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
lea.
the
secretary's
formula,
and
i
don't
think
we
should
be
arguing
whose
formula
is
better,
because
if
they
are
different,
congress
wins,
but
nevertheless,
the
secretary's
formula,
it
eliminates
26
percent
of
the
school
districts.
and
under
new
mexico,
if
you,
if
you
look
at
the
top
and
the
bottom
school
district
even
after
the
eliminating
of
these
funding
differentials,
you've
got
a
244
percent
disparity.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
and
justice
breyer,
i
think
congress
and
in
its
methodology
has
disagreed
with
that
view,
because
it
does
not
rely
strictly
upon
pupils,
and
pupils
are
not
necessarily
the
driving
force
in
how
we
work
this
formula.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
and
that
is
correct.
because
these
districts
particularly
in
new
mexico
serve
a
unique
purpose.
new
mexico
has
pockets
of,
of
urban
and
populations,
and
then
they
have
got
small
traditional
villages;
they
have
got
farming
communities;
they
have
got
indian
lands;
they
have
got
military
bases.
and
a
school
district
whether
it
educates
100
children
or
1,000
children
or
5,000
children
has
a
special
value
in
the
state
and
in
our
educational
process.
and
simply
because
a
child
in
new
mexico
attends
the
school
district
that
does
not
have
particularly
many
students
in
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
to
suffer
a
poorer
education
than
his
brethren
and
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
metropolitan
area.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
justice
ginsburg,
the
secretary
recognized
in
1976
that
both
methodologies
have
their
problems,
depending
on
how
your
districts,
the
number
of
districts
that
you
have
in
a
state,
their
relative
populations,
how
they
line
up.
and--
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
--that's
the
bottom
line.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
and
i
would
point
out,
justice
stevens,
that
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
the
impact
aid
is
supposed
to
go
to
the
impacted
districts.
it
is
not
supposed
to
fund
the
general
educational
program
of
a
state.
the
money
that
the
state,
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
seeks
to
retain
is
under
a
limited
exception
that
has
been
created
and
it
is,
it
is
not
that
we
are
trying
to
take
the
state's
money
as
the
bottom
line.
it
is
that
the
state
has
taken
the
impact
aid
dollars
and
doesn't
have
an
equalized
system.
new
mexico
could
equalize
if
it
wants
to.
it
established
its
equalization
formula.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
it
actually
depends...
you
get
into
statistical
approaches,
but
if,
let's
say,
there
were
less
than
20
districts,
you
just
had
let's
say
18
districts
or
19
districts,
then
if
you
do
the
percentile
against,
if
you
work
the
percentile
in
that
particular
setting,
nobody
gets
eliminated.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
correct,
because
you
would
run...
because
if
you
had
districts,
big
districts
at
both
ends,
you
run
your
5
percent
on
both
ends
with
the
students,
you
end
up
not
eliminating
anybody.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
well,
justice
breyer,
i,
i
would
respectfully
like
to
go
back,
not
to
what
we
are
trying
to
accomplish
through
judicial
decision,
but
what
congress
accomplished
through
its
decision.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
right.
if
i
could
address
that,
your
honor.
the
only
argument
i
see
the
state
has
is
the
argument
about
absurdity.
this
debate
that
we're
having
now
is
the
debate
that
took
place
in
1976
in
front
of
the
secretary.
he
recognized
that
there
were
two
methodologies
that
he
was
considering.
he
recognized
that
they
both
had
their
problems.
but
in
1994,
congress
had
before
it
at
least
or
had
available
to
it
information
as
to
the,
whether,
what,
how
this
particular
formula
would
work.
there
were
only
three
and
perhaps...
three
states,
kansas,
alaska,
new
mexico,
and
perhaps
arizona...
that
had...
that
were
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the,
of
this
narrow
exception.
so
they
knew
the
configuration
and
the
composition
of
these
school
districts.
and
so
they
could
look
if
they
wanted
to...
and
there's
no
legislative
history
to
this,
but
they
could
have
looked
if
they
had
wanted
to,
to
exactly
what
the
practical
effect
would
be
of
these
two
formulas.
and
the
practical
effect
is
that
in
new
mexico
the
formula
which
the
respondents
contend
is
absurd
reduced
only
11
percent
of
the
leas.
and
with
the
backdrop
that
this,
that
these
leas
should
have
been
more
or
less
equalized
anyhow
because
of
removing
the
disparate
funding,
that's,
that's
much
more
reasonable
and
certainly
doesn't
reflect
an
absurdity,
and
when
you
compare
that
to
the
secretary's
approach
which
eliminates
26
percent
and
cuts
loose
23
school
districts
out
of
89
from
any
consideration
and
you
end
up
with
kind
of
a
core
block
in
their
14
or
15
percent
disparity,
i
think
there
may
be
those
who
could
argue
forcefully
that
that's
an
absurdity.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
kansas
equalizes
under
any
formula,
as
new
mexico
did,
could
do.
alaska,
you
eliminate
22
percent
in
order
for
them
to
just
kind
of
squeak
by.
if
they
applied
congress's
formula
they
would
just
equalize.
this
is
an
option
i
contend
that's
available
to
every
state
that
wants
to
take
advantage.
if
you
give
them
a
25
percent
disparity
allowance,
you
allow
them
to
back
out
disequalizing
expenditures.
there's
really
no
explanation
that's
been
offered
why
there's
any
disequalization
at
all.
with
that,
if
there
is
any
time...
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
mr.
chief
justice
had
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the,
an
appendix
is
something
different
from
a
regulation
or
carries
a
different
weight,
and
i
haven't
found
anything
determinative.
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
young
versus
community
nutrition
institute
where
it
identifies
something
similar
to
an
appendix
as
an
example,
and
the
court
says
an
example
is
just
that,
an
example.
and
i
don't
think
we
need
the
argument
to
prevail,
but
we
would
submit
that
it
is
at
best
confusion,
it's
confusing
that
the
secretary
would
take
the
body
of
the
methodology
proposed
by
congress,
put
it
in
his,
in
the
body
of
his
regulation,
and
then
refer
the
public
to
an
appendix
in
order
to,
how
to
work
the
methodology.
and
in
this
appendix,
he
then
flips
what
congress
intended
and
what
he
had
in
the
body
of
his
own
regulation.
i
would
also
suggest
that
congress
cannot
be
presumed
even
in
this
instance
to
not
be,
at
least
have
some
input
as
to
what
was
happening.
in
the
senate
bill,
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
a
suggestion
that
the
disparity
figure
would
only
be
10
percent
and
not
25
percent.
that
didn't
make
it
through
but
the
statute
as
it
was
written,
and
i
think
lasted
for
about
a
year
or
so,
had
the
disparity
amount
going
from
25
percent
to
20
percent.
that
was
subsequently
amended
and
kept
back
up
at
the
25
percent
level.
so
the
idea
that
this
was
not
a
bill
where
congress
paid
attention,
i
think,
is
not
a
warranted
assumption.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
there
is
a
provision,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
impact
aid
act,
and
i
think
it's
7113,
in
which
it
basically
says
that
if
the
secretary
of
the
education
perceives
that
a
state
is
manipulating
its
leas
in
a
way
in
which
to
take
advantage
of
the,
of
this
limited
exception,
it
can
disregard
that
action.
so
i
think
there
is
built...
i
think
congress
was
one
step
ahead
of
us
and
recognized
that
possibility
and
addressed
it.
mr.
ronald
j.
vanamberg
thank
you.
with
that,
thank
you
very
much.
