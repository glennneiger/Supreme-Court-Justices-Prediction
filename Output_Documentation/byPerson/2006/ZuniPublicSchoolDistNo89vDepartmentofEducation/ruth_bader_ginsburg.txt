justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
van
amberg,
they
were
essentially
the
same
as
the
prior
regulations,
were
they
not?
and
those
regulations
had
gone
through
the
notice
and
comment
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
formula
was
proposed
to
congress
by
the
department
of
education,
which
is
not
something
that
congress
did
in
other
words,
to
stop
the
secretary
from
whatever
he
was
doing.
but
it
was
indeed...
wasn't
it
the
secretary's
own
language
that
congress
enacted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
just
as
to
that,
the
provision
that
we're
talking
about,
do
you
say,
you
say
it
wasn't
drafted
by
the
department
of
education?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
as...
as
far
as
the
difference
in
time,
it
was
the
secretary's
decision,
the
later
secretary's
decision
to
retain,
as
you
acknowledged,
the,
almost
the
identical
regulation.
you
said
it
didn't
go
through
notice
and
comment
the
second
time,
but
the
text
was
basically
the
same
in
'76
and
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i
appreciate
that.
but
the
text
of
it,
what
the
regulation
said
was
not
significantly
different
from
what
the
earlier
regulation
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
van
amberg,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
one
relevant
consideration
might
be
how
would
this
work
across
states,
and
i
think
it's
true,
is
it
not,
that
your
reading
would
lead
to
wildly
different,
wildly
different
results
from
state
to
state
depending
on
whether
they
have
large
districts
or
small
districts
at
the
top
and
the
bottom,
whereas
the
other
way,
counting
pupils
rather
than
school
districts
regardless
of
size,
you
would
get
uniformity
going
from
state
to
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
enlighten
us
a
little
bit
about
how
this
statute
developed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
the
same
secretary
of
education
when
the
statute
came
on
the
books
and
when
the
regulation
was
kind
of
readopted,
i
think
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
was
a
peculiar
proposal
to
drop,
it
was
the
secretary's
proposal
to
drop
the
bottom
five.
so
it
was
a
different
proposal,
and
what
was
the
reason
for
that?
why
keep,
keep
the
95th
percentile
but
not
the
5th?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
van
amberg,
could
a
state
get
to
the
same
result?
let's
say
your
reading
of
the
statute
is
the
only
permissible
one.
by
combining
school
districts,
it's
no
longer
going
to
be
the
x
school
district
and
the
y
school
district,
it
will
be
the
xy
school
district,
and
then
the
population
would
increase.
still
only
one
lea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
