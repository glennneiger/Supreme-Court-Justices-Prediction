mr.
srinivasan,
you...
you
may
have
convinced
me.
i'll
stipulate
that
you
have
convinced
me
that
the
argument
that
you're
arguing
for
would
probably
be
a
better
method,
but
you
haven't
touched
the
text
of
(b)(2)(b)(i)
yet,
and
that's
where
some
of
us
at
least
are,
are
having
our...
our
problems.
do
you
agree
that
in
the
absence
of
the
other
program,
i
forget
the,
the
acronym
for
it...
that
you
really
would
not
have
any
argument
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
text
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
would
you
address
the
text?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
is
supposed
to
be
disregarded
are
educational
agencies?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
the
agencies
are
identified
how?
how
do
we
identify
the
agencies
that
would
be
disregarded?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
identify
their
per-pupil
revenues,
too,
don't
we?
agencies
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues
above
or
below,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
critical
test
is
being
applied
to
an
agency
which
is
being
identified
by
reference
to
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues,
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
merely
that
they
are
associated
with.
the
very
definition,
the
very
identification
of
lea
here
is
exclusively
in
terms
of
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues.
it's
not
merely
in
association.
it
is
a
definition,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
then,
then
what
does
the
phrase
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues
above
95
or
below
5
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
doesn't
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
identification
of
an
entity
or
person,
if
you
want,
to
be
disregarded
is
the
identification
of
an
lea,
and
the
lea
is
described
in
terms
exclusively
of
its
expenditures
or
revenues.
so
why
doesn't
that
foreclose
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
obviously--
justice
david
h.
souter
--after
identifying
them
in
terms
of
the
expenditures
or
revenues.
that's
what
you're
supposed
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
lots
of
things
that
congress
could
have
done
differently
from
what
it
did
do,
but
it,
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
inject
an
ambiguity
in
the
identification
in,
in
this
subsection
of
the
lea
that
we
are
talking
about.
and
it
doesn't
create
an
ambiguity
in,
in
the
clear
provision
that
what
is
to
be
disregarded
is
an
lea
as
so
defined.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
that's
another
way
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
it,
but
tell
me
why
that
is
consistent
with
the
text.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says
disregard
leas;
it
then
identifies
certain
leas
which
are
to
be
disregarded.
nowhere
does
it
say
disregard
pupils.
