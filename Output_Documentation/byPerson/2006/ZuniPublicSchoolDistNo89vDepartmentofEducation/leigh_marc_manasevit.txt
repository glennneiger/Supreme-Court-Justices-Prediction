mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
justice
ginsburg's
question,
because
i
think
that
that
is
very
illuminating
to
where
we
are
today.
this
statute
began
against
a
history,
an
18-year
history
where
the
agency
had
been
delegated
by
congress
virtually
carte
blanche
authority
to
devise
equalization
tests.
that
was
the
earlier
statute.
the
agency
had
three
tests
at
the
time.
one
was
the
25
percent
disparity
test
that
we
see
today
and
there
were
two
other
tests.
in
1994,
what
happened
was
the
secretary
proposed
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
following
the
secretary's
lead
eliminated
the
two
other
tests.
that's,
that's
what
was
happening.
and
justice
scalia
asked
well,
why
would
the
secretary
tie
his
hands?
what
happened
was
the
secretary
no
longer
was
satisfied
or
liked
the
other
two
tests
and
eliminated
those
and
proposed
the
test
that
he
had
been
using
for
18
years
to
the
congress.
congress
adopted
that
test
and
that's
the
test
that
we
have
today,
the
25
percent
disparity
test.
the
difference
is
that
whereas
the
secretary
had
the
free
rein
to
develop
that
disparity
test,
however
he
wanted,
previously,
the
secretary...
the
congress
now
told
the
secretary
in
disparity,
do
the
following
things.
first
of
all
25
percent
is
the
maximum
disparity
that
we
are
going
to
allow
you,
number
one.
and
number
two,
take
out
the
outliers
in
a
range
of
5
to--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--fair
question,
justice
scalia,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
where
of
course
we
begin,
and
we
have
to
look
precisely
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute,
what
petitioners
mistake
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
here
has
a
two-part
process.
we
don't
look
at
leas
first.
it
doesn't
say
5th
percentile
of
leas.
we
have
to
first
rank
expenditures
or
revenues
in
the
state.
it's
above
95th
percentile
or
below
5th
percentile
of
the
expenditures.
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
of
such.
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
and
"such"
would
refer
just--
to
the
previous
usage
of
that
precise
term,
which
is
disregard
local
education
agencies
with
per-pupil
expenditures
or
revenues.
so
it's
that
"with
per-pupil
revenues"
that
the
"such"
would
refer
back
to,
the
most
immediate
prior
reference,
so
we're
still
looking
at
per-pupil
revenues
or
expenditures
in
the
state
which
we
have
to
rank
first.
we
don't
identify
leas
first.
it
doesn't
say
95th
percentile
of
leas.
it
tells
us
rank
per-pupil
revenue.
the
only
difference--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--no.
it
says...
it
says...
we
are
disregarding
the
leas.
that's
the
end
of
the
process.
but
we
have
to
identify
the
range
of
value
that
5
percent
and
95
percent
applies
to.
the
range...
the
percentiles
apply
to
a
range
of
values.
we
have
in
new
mexico,
we
have
89
amounts
of
per-pupil
revenue
per
district,
we
have
89
of
those.
but
we
also
have
377,000
per-pupil
revenues,
because
a
per-pupil
revenue
repeats
for
every
time
that
there's
a
student,
and--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
not
saying
that
it
can't.
we're...
all
we're
saying
is
that
it
equally
carries
both
meanings.
school
finance
is
an
extraordinarily
technical
area,
which
is
precisely
why
congress
left
this
issue
to
the
agency
to
work
this
out.
when
congress...
when
congress
used
the
terms
5
percent
and
10
percent,
and
again
i'm
not,
i'm
not
reading
congress's
mind
to
say
that
when
congress
used
those
terms,
those
percentiles,
congress
must
have
intended
some
national
uniformity.
this
is
a
national
program
and
congress
expects
these
programs
to
be
applied
somewhat
uniformly
across...
across
the
country.
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
well,
to--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--well,
i
believe--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--i
believe
simply
that
the
word
per-pupil
revenue
can
mean
the
dollar
amount
per
each
agency
89
times,
or
it
can
mean
repeated
each
time
a
student
generates--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--yes.
correct.
remember--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--well,
bear
in
mind...
bear
in
mind
the
nature
of
many
education--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--that
answer
i
couldn't
answer,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
typically
in
an
education
statute,
funding
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
numbers
of
pupils.
so
if
the
statute
says
$3,000
per
pupil
shall
go
somewhere,
the...
the
statute
means
you
take
that
dollar
amount
and
you--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--well,
we
always...
we
always
will
have
disparity
in
the
real
world
and
that...
and
that's
because
lots
of
things
cause
disparity.
in
this
case
actually,
local
tax
revenues
are
not
the
cause
of
disparity
because
there
are
no
significant
local
tax
revenues
at
issue
here.
but
disparity
happens...
in
the
top
three
or
four
districts
in
new
mexico
you
have
under
100
students,
or
slightly
over
100
students.
in
a
district
that
small,
minor
things,
an
insurance
recovery
for
example,
a
couple
hundred
thousand
dollar
insurance
recovery
in
a
district
of
87
students
will
generate
$3,000
of
revenue
per
member
for
that
year.
it's
a
distorting
figure.
that's
precisely
what
congress
is
trying
to
get
rid
of.
but
when
congress
says
5
percent,
presumably
congress
intends
that
5
percent
to
have
some
uniform
applicability
across
the
country
and
not
vary
with
a
state
like
new
mexico
where
it
would
just
eliminate
five
districts.
or
in
our...
in
our
neighboring
state
of
maryland,
montgomery
county
has
the
highest
per-pupil
revenues
in
the
state.
it
has
16
percent
of
the
population.
under
petitioners'
view,
that...
and
it
has
24
districts,
so
that
district
would
be
eliminated
under
petitioners'
view.
it
would
completely
be
eliminated.
yet
under
our
view,
the
10
percent
would
fall
within
that
and
we
would
keep
it
in.
so--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
that
was
on
the
list
of
things
that
i
wanted
to
cover,
and
i'm
sure
that
petitioners
'counsel
inadvertently
misspoke.
impact
aid
never
ever
gets
diverted
from
the
district.
impact
aid
goes
from
the
federal
government
pursuant
to
a
formula--
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
--well,
remember,
the
state
figures
a
total
cost
of
program
for
every
district
starting
from
zero,
number
of
students
and
dollars
needed
to
manage
those
number
of
students,
and
the
state
supplies
that
amount
of
money.
so
where
the
district
gets
some
of
that
necessary
money
from
another
source,
the
state
under
equalization
is
allowed
to
just
consider
that
that
amount
of
money,
in
addition
to
what
the
state
is
going
to
provide,
will
provide
the
entire
amount.
ms.
leigh
marc
manasevit
thank
you
very
much.
