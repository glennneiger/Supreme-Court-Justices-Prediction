mr.
fisher,
there's
another
potential
impediment
in
this
case
and
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
that
is
the
petition
from
the
sentence,
it
was
second
in
time.
there
was
a
prior
petition
that
challenged
just
the
conviction,
and
under
the
governing
statute,
to
have
a
second
petition,
you've
got
to
get
permission
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
to
meet
stringent
criteria.
how
do
you
get
past
that?
you
went
out
concentrating
on
the
petition
addressed
to
the
sentence
which
is
a
second
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
did...
then
you
are
bifurcating
the
judgment
in
a
criminal
case,
which
is
not
the
sentence.
you
are
saying
there's
an
earlier
judgment,
and
looking
at
it
as
we
would
as
if
it
were
a
civil
case,
if
you
have
a
determination
of
liability,
that
doesn't
give
you
a
final
judgment.
the
judgment
will
come
at
the
end
of
the
case
when
damages
are
determined.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
decisions
going
the
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
law
was
that
the
sentence
shall
be
concurrent
unless,
and
the
unless
is
that
the
judge
makes
an
additional
finding,
the
very
same
kind
of
finding
that
he
would
make
in
determining
aggravating
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
overturned
in
ring?
