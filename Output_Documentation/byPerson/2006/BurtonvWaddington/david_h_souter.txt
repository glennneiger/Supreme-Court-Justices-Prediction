h.

mr.
fisher,
you
know,
assuming
we
read
it
the
way
you
read
it,
i've
got
a
basic
problem
that
doesn't
really
surface
until
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
briefs
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
comment
on
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
that
is...
or
i'll
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
question.
is
the
decision
which
the
judge
makes
here
to
sentence
consecutively
rather
than
concurrently,
a
decision
that
requires
the
finding
of
any
fact
about
the
commission
of
the
crimes
themselves
or
the
circumstances
of
those
crimes
or
about
the
defendant's
character?
does
the
judge
have
to
make
or
does
the
fact...
some
fact
finder
have
to
make
a
finding
on
any
of
those
subjects...
crimes,
circumstances,
character
of
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
that
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
only
fact
that
had
to
be
found
was
that,
given
the
classification
sentencing
scheme
washington
had,
there
would
be,
in
effect,
a
free
crime,
no
incremental
punishment,
unless
there
were
consecutive
sentencing.
that's
not
a
fact
that
falls
within
any
of
those
categories
of
crime,
character,
or
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
misnomer
to
say
it's
a
mere
free
crime
criterion?
it's
free
crime
plus
some
further
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
extra
fact
then
is
a
lot
like
the
sort
of
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
aggravator?
i
mean,
it's
comparable
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
could
the
nature
of
the
additional
crimes
themselves
satisfy
it?
in
other
words,
could
the
judge
say,
well,
all
three...
it
might
be
one
thing
if
one
were
serious
and
the
other
two
were
trivial,
but
all
of
these
three
are
very
serious.
now,
that's
in
effect
a
value
judgment,
not
a
finding
of
discrete
fact.
could
that
value
judgment
satisfy
the
extraordinary
criterion
that
washington
says
there
must
be
in
addition
to
free
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
first
proceeding
was
not
in
fact
jurisdictionally
barred,
then
you
would
lose
under
the
second
and
successive
objection
in
this
case,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
those
cases
in
which
the
first
judgment
is
complete,
he
simply
does
not
attack
everything
that
was
a
predicate
for
the
first
judgment;
and
then
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
new
trial,
and
a
new
judgment,
of
course,
the
habeas
possibility
arises
again,
whereas
in
this
case,
the
first
judgment
was
not
complete.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
is
the
only
judgment
that
could
be
attacked
on
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
collins,
isn't
it
your
position
that,
number
one,
the
only
judgment
that
he
can
attack
on
habeas
is
the
judgment
that
is
extant
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
proceeding,
and
that
is
the
'92
judgment
that
follows
the
resentencing?
but
he
may
in
attacking
that
judgment
attack
the
premise
of
conviction
which
occurred
earlier?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
he
chooses
to
attack
only
the
earlier
conviction
which
is
the
premise
of
the
later
judgment,
he
has
simply
in
effect
waived
any
other
issue.
and
when
he
comes
in
later
and
tries
to
raise
the
issue
that
he
could
have
attacked
under
the
'92
judgment,
he's
in
effect
trying
to
split
up
his
habeas,
it's
second
and
successive,
and
that's
why
he
can't
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
the
statute
governing
our
review
had
an
exhaustion
requirement
and
a
second
and
successive
requirement
comparable
to
the
aedpa
requirement,
the
case
that
justice
scalia
put
would
be
exactly
like
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
i
keep
doing
this.
i'm
sorry.
is
that
sufficient,
as
you
understand
it,
under
the
washington
case
that
your
brother
cited
to
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
to
say
that
that
would
have
been
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
fact
that
is
not
what
the
trial
court
premised
its
decision
on,
because,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
it
went
on
in
findings
19,
20,
and
21
about
deliberate
cruelty,
sophistication
and
planning,
and
so
on.
having
been
through
those
findings,
the
court
says,
from
the
foregoing
facts
the
court
now
makes
the
following
conclusions
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
as
though
the
trial
court
was
basing
its
decision
on
those
foregoing
facts
as
well
as
upon
finding
18,
which
was
the
free
crime
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
the
fact
that
he
might
have...
i'm
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
trial
court
might
on
the
basis
simply
of
the
free
crime
conclusion
have
sentenced
consecutively,
is
simply
not
the
case
that
we've
got,
because
he
sentenced
consecutively
on
that
basis
and
on
cruelty,
sophistication,
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it
logical
for
them
to
conclude
it
or
were
they...
were
they
expressing
the
hope
that
the
court
would
draw
a
distinction
which
it
had
not
drawn
in
the
formulation
that
it
gave
in
apprendi?
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
if
you
draw
no
further
distinctions,
apprendi
requires
a
certain
result.
it's
another
thing
to
say
but
maybe
they
will
draw
a
distinction
and
we're
going
to
predict
that
they
will,
and
hence
not
apply
apprendi.
weren't
the
other
appellate
courts
to
which
you
refer
engaged
in
the
latter
exercise,
which
i
call
the
exercise
of
hope?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
doesn't
that
require
drawing
a
distinction
that
apprendi
did
not
speak
to?
and
isn't
it
still
the
case
that,
i
think
mr.
fisher
points
out
that
three
times
we
repeated
in
apprendi
the
formula
about
fact,
beyond
fact
found
by
a
jury
on
the
basis
of
which,
et
cetera,
the
range
increases.
isn't
the
distinction
which...
and
i
trust
your
recollection
here...
that
justice
o'connor
had
in
mind
and
that
they
had
in
mind
a
distinction
which
simply
was
not
addressed
in
apprendi
and
would
have
been
something
new
as
opposed
to
merely
an
application
of
what
was
implicit
in
apprendi?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
true
in
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
mean,
i'm
sure
you're
reading
correctly,
but
is
that
in
fact
true?
because,
having
talked,
as
i
just
read
out
a
moment
ago,
having
spoken
about
free
crimes,
aggravating
factors,
it
says,
on
the
basis
of
the
foregoing
facts
i
now
draw
the
following
conclusions
of
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
can
treat
it
in
effect...
and
this
may
be
the
way
to
do
it...
we
can
treat
it
as
the
ultimate
sentencer
was
the
washington
appellate
court
and
that's
what
they
said?
