so
you
think
there
can
always
be
two
petitions,
one...
of
sentences
on
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
bit
is
that
also
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
you...
are
you
asking
us
to
say
that
while
the
sentence
is
still
under
review,
there
can
be
no
habeas
petition
filing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
that
up
to
the
option
of
the
petitioner?
he
can
take
his
chances
or
he
can
wait.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
if
it
is
your
position
whether
or
not
he
properly
can
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
that
doesn't
make
the
dissenters
in
blakely
feel
very
good.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
you
have
to
show
that
the
result
was
dictated
by
the
prior
precedent.
that's
a
strong
phrase.
we
said
it
in
stringer...
stringer
versus
black.
but
if
it
has
a
new
application,
that's...
that's
new.
even
though
the
principle
is
the
same.
