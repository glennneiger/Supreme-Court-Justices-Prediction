mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
sharp
versus
pain,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
first
decided
the
question
that's
before
you
today,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
and
i'm
quoting:
"the
rule
of
blakely
that
the
statutory
maximum
is
the
maximum
sentence
a
judge
may
impose
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict,
was
not
clear
until
the
blakely
decision
itself.
"
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
wrong.
in
this
court's
apprendi
decision
it
laid
down
precisely
that
rule.
at
page
483
of
that
decision
this
court
described
the
statutory
maximum
concept
as,
quote,
"the
maximum
a
defendant
would
receive
if
punished
according
to
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict
alone.
"
--virtually
the
identical
language.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
he
does,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
precisely
the
same
kind
of
fact
that
the
judge
had
to
find
in
blakely
itself.
under
the
washington,
revised
code
of
washington,
the
statute,
the
statute
for
running
sentences
consecutively
in
the
fashion
that
mr.
burton's
were
run
consecutively,
refers
the
judge
back
to
the
very
same
provision
that
was
at
issue
in
blakely
itself,
which
is
the
aggravating
factors
provision
of
washington,
which
was
formerly
codified
at
section
390
and
is
now
codified
at
section--
400.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that
would
be
a
fact,
justice
souter,
but
that
is
not
the
way
the
washington
law
works.
it
is
colloquially
known
as
the
free
crime
aggravator.
but
in
the
washington
supreme
court
decision
in
hughes
which
is
cited
at
the
end
of
our
reply
brief
the
washington
supreme
court
made
clear
that
to
invoke
that
aggravator
a
court
has
to
find
that
there
was
extraordinarily
serious
culpability
or
extraordinarily
serious
harm
that
accompanies
the
multiple
offenses.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
and
this
court's
decision...
i'm
sorry.
the
washington
supreme
court
decision
in
hughes
clearly
lays
that
out.
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
the
way
the
consecutive
sentences
work
in
washington,
i
want
to
give
you
one
other
citation,
to
a
new
washington
court
of
appeals
decision
that
considers
a
consecutive
sentences
imposed
exactly
the
same
way
that
mr.
burton's
was.
that
is
to
say,
they
are
run
consecutively
based
on
the
clearly
too
lenient
factor.
that
case
is
called
state
versus
washington
and
it
was
just
reported
at
143
p.
3d
606,
143
p.
3d
606.
the
washington
court
of
appeals
in
that
case,
considering
a
sentence
just
like
mr.
burton's,
says
that
it
does
trigger
and
violate
blakely.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
exactly,
it's
part
of
the
same
list.
and
as
this
court
said
in
apprendi
itself,
that
extra
culpability,
which
is
one
of
the
ways
this
aggravator
can
be
met,
is
the
quintessential
type
of
element
that
needs
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
in
section...
the
current
section
is
section
589
of
the
washington
code
and
it
says
that
sentences
shall
run
concurrently
unless
the
judge
makes
an
extra
finding
of
exactly
the
same
type
the
judge
is
required
to
find
in
blakely.
and
if
you
look
at
blakely
itself,
remember
blakely
involved
concurrent
sentences.
and
so
what
washington
is
doing
is
saying
all
sentences
should
run
concurrently
unless
there's
an
extra
fact,
something
about
the
additional
crimes
that
would
otherwise
be
running
concurrently,
that
simply
requires
the
judge
to
go
above
and
beyond
the
ordinary
concurrent
sentences
and
punish
those
crimes
separately.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
it
couldn't,
and
the
washington
decision
that
i've
cited
to
you
will
help
you
with
this,
because
it
makes
it
clear
that
to
trigger
an
aggravator
to
run
sentences
concurrently,
just
as
under
blakely
itself,
there
has
to
be
something
above
and
beyond
the
elements
of
the
crime
or
the
crimes
themselves.
it
can't
simply
be...
i'm
sorry.
it
can't
simply
be
that
there
were
three
crimes
committed
and
all
three
of
them
are
very
serious.
it
has
to
be
something
about
the
crime,
the
additional
crimes,
that
takes
it
above
and
beyond
the
ordinary
commission
of
that
crime.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
not
sure
i
follow,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
you're
certainly
right
that
in
this
case
you
needed
to
have
an
extra
finding
of
fact.
there
are
some
situations
under
the
washington
code
and
i
believe
in
the
majority
of
other
states
where
it
is
up
to
the
judge's
discretion
whether
to
run
sentences
concurrently,
and
he
could
do
it
for
the
reason
that
justice
souter
described.
so
what
washington
does
in
its
respondent's
brief
is
it
cites
these
other
state
decisions,
from
other
states
that
simply
have
different
sentencing
systems
than
we
have
in
washington.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
under
some
state
systems
that
might
be
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
in
washington
the
way
that
the
code
works
is
that
judges
are
directed
that
for
multiple
crimes
the
sentences
shall
run
consecutively.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
unless
they
make
the
exact
kind
of
extra
finding,
and
it
refers
them
to
the
precise
same
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
blakely
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
the
judge
needs
to
make
an
extra
finding
beyond
the
elements
of
either
of
those
two
crimes
to
run
them
consecutively,
then
it
would
violate
blakely.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
you
haven't
had
a
case
in
the
apprendi-blakely
line
of
cases
dealing
with
consecutive
sentences.
but
what
you've
done
is
laid
down
a
rule
from
the
very
state
that
we're
dealing
with
here
that
says
that
if
the
judge
needs
to
make
an
extra
finding
beyond
the
elements
of
the
crimes
of
conviction
and
beyond
the
facts
encompassed
in
the
jury's
finding
of
guilt
for
those
crimes,
then
those
findings
need
to
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that's
why
in
this
case
that
line,
that
rule,
is
triggered.
the
ninth
circuit
of
course
didn't
talk
about
any
of
this.
what
it
said,
as
i
mentioned,
is
that
it
simply
took
apprendi
to
be
a
purely
formalistic
rule
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts
according
to
the
jury
verdict,
but
it
just
had
to
do
with
whatever
the
state
happened
to
label
as
the
statutory
maximum.
in
apprendi
this
court
said,
not
once
but
three
times,
that
the
statutory
maximum
concept
was
triggered
according
to
the
facts
encompassed
in
the
jury
verdict.
and
like
the
washington
courts,
the
ninth
circuit
simply
ignored
that
language
in
this
court's
opinion.
lest
there
be
any
doubt
about
the
way
that
concept
mapped
onto
this
case,
this
court
said
in
apprendi
itself
that
the
relevant
inquiry
was
not
one
of
form
but
one
of
effect:
does
the
required
finding
take
a
defendant
to
a
higher
sentence
level
than
would
otherwise
be
permissible
based
on
the
facts
encompassed
in
the
jury
verdict?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
this
is
the
very
first
petition
that
mr.
burton
has
filed
against
the
1998
judgment.
he
did
file
earlier
a
petition
against
the
original
judgment
of
1994.
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
34,
that
is
where
that
petition
is
reprinted.
he
says
quite
clearly
that
he
is
challenging
the
1994
judgment
in
that
petition,
whereas
here
this
is
his
first
petition
against
the
1998
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
if
what
the
state
is
saying
is
correct,
which
is
to
say
that
we
don't
have
any
judgment
at
all
until
the
sentence
is
final,
then
all
you
get
from
that
is
that
mr.
burton's
first
petition
should
have
been
dismissed
and
the
court
could
have
gotten
it
dismissed.
but
we
submit
what
you
can't
do
from
that
is
retroactively
change
the
first
petition
that
he
explicitly
told
the
court
was
against
the
1994
judgment,
and
that
he
told
the
court
in
that
same
filing
on
ja
35
and
ja
40,
that
his
sentence
was
still
on
direct
review.
you
can't
retroactively
change
that
challenge
to
the
1994
judgment
into
one
against
the
1998
judgment,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
if
the
state
is
right,
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
had
jurisdiction
under
that
1998...
challenge
against
the
1998
judgment
either,
because
as
mr.
burton
forthrightly
told
the
court,
that
sentence
was
still
on
direct
review.
but
even
if
you
get
past
that,
we
submit
that
this
court's
castro
decision
simply
doesn't
allow
a
court,
especially
retroactively,
to
recharacterize
a
habeas
petition
that
the
petitioner
himself
said
was
against
one
judgment
as
against
another.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
there
can't,
justice
kennedy.
and
so
what
should
have
happened
according
to
the
state's
theory,
is
that
the
first
petition
should,
should
simply
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's...
this
court
hasn't
laid
down
a
solid
decision.
but
i
think
that's
a
better
reading.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
am
i
asking--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization,
justice
kennedy.
but
what
mr.
burton
did
is
he
want
to
the
district
court
saying
i'm
challenging
the
1994
judgment.
and
as
i
was
saying,
under
castro
before
that
gets
recharacterized--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
so.
but
i'm
just
recognizing
that
that's
a
jurisdictional
question
that
this
court
would
decide
for
itself.
but
assuming
that
he
can't
do
that,
what
the
district
court
would
have
had
to
say
is,
mr.
burton,
you're
not
allowed
to
challenge
the
1994
judgment.
and
let's
assume
for
the
moment
he
could
have
challenged
the
1998
judgment.
the
district
judge
would
have
said,
"now
mr.
burton,
you're
only
challenging
your
conviction
for
the
1994
judgment.
"
"you
need
to
wait
until
you're
ready
to
challenge
your
sentence,
and
then
you
can
challenge
the
1998
judgment.
"
presumably...
and
this
is
i
think
a
fair
inference
especially
from
the
petition
itself
as
it
is
reprinted,
since
he
told
the
district
court
that
he
was
challenging
his
sentence,
if
he
was
told
he
couldn't
bring
it
at
that
time
he
would
have
said
okay,
i
will
withdraw
it
and
wait
until
i
can
challenge
my
sentence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
know
that
we
would,
justice
souter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
because
it
is
a
common
rule
that...
this
court
hasn't
had
a
case
exactly
like
this,
but
the
lower
courts
do
all
the
time;
and
the
fourth
circuit
case
in
taylor
which
i've
cited
in
the
reply
brief
is
one
of
them.
where,
it
is
a
common
practice
for
a
petitioner
to
bring
one
petition
against
a
judgment
and
then
be
partially
successful,
and
then
bring
a
new
petition
against
something
in
the
new
judgment.
and
that's
essentially
what
happened
here.
and
it
may--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
you
put
your
finger
on
it
exactly.
and
so,
but
we
still
think
that,
that,
either
the
court
had
jurisdiction
or
it
didn't.
and
if
it
had
jurisdiction,
then
it
must
be...
fall
in
somehow
into
the
category
that
you're
talking
about.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
could
a
district
judge
have
done
that?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
what
would
have
needed
to
have
happened
here,
since
mr.
burton
at
pages
35
and
40
of
the
joint
appendix,
told
the
district
judge,
i'm
still
challenging
my
sentence
on
direct
appeal,
under
aedpa
and
customary
comity
principles,
the
judge
would
have
needed
to
say,
you
need
either
to
renounce
that
appeal
from
the
state
court
or
renounce
this
one.
you
couldn't
do
both
at
the
same
time.
mr.
burton,
if
he
had
wanted
to,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
could
have
gone
into
district
court
and
said,
i
now
have
a
new
judgment
and
i'm
going
to
challenge
my
conviction
and
sentence
because
i
have
no
intention
of
challenging
my
sentence
through
state
court
proceedings.
and
perhaps
he
could
have
done
that.
but
that
would
be
a
very
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here.
if
i
can
turn
back
to
the,
not
a
new
rule
question,
another
angle
at
this
is
not
simply
to
look
at
the
text
of
this
court's
opinion
in
apprendi
which
we
submit
told
a
state
court
in
this
situation
all
it
would
have
needed
to
know,
but
also
perhaps
it
is
helpful
to
look
behind
that
and
look
at
the
statutes
that
were
in
play
in
new
jersey
and
in
washington.
and
even
if
you
did
that
it
becomes,
we
submit,
very
clear
that
a
district
judge,
any
reasonable
trial
judge,
that
is,
would
have
known
that
apprendi
applied
here.
what
you
had
in
new
jersey
was
essentially
two
statutes.
one
that
said
an
ordinary
commission
of
a
crime
is
punishable
up
to
10
years.
and
a
second
statute
that
said
if
you
commit
that
crime
with
some
kind
of
extra...
extra
bad
circumstance,
there
a
hate
crime,
then
you
get...
you
can
get
a
higher
sentence.
exactly
the
same
thing
was
true
in
washington.
we
had
one
statute
that
said
this
is
what
the,
this
is
what
the
punishment
is
for
the
ordinary
commission
of
this
crime.
and
we
had
an
extra
statute
that
said,
but
if
you
commit
that
crime
with
extra
bad
circumstances...
and
here
the
only
difference
was,
there
was
a
list
of
circumstances,
not
just
a
single
one...
but
if
you
commit
the
crime
with
extra
circumstances,
then
you
can
get
extra
punishment.
and
the
analogy
that
the
respondents
want
to
draw
between
the
washington
sentencing
system
and
the
federal
guidelines
just
simply
doesn't
hold
up.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
fair
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
because
in
blakely
all
you
needed
to
do
was
apply
apprendi
which
said
that
if
you
have
two
different
statutory
thresholds,
the
pertinent
threshold
for
sixth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
is
the
one
that
cabins
the
judge's
discretion
based
on
the
facts
in
the
jury
verdict.
to
decide
booker
this
court
had
to
take
the
term
statutory
maximum
and
apply
that
to
a
different
type
of
threshold,
which
was
as
this
court
put
it
a
court
rule
or
a
quasi
legislative
enactment.
so
under...
under
the
system
that
this
court
reviewed
in
booker,
you
had
only
a
single
true
statutory
maximum.
and
then
you
had
to
decide
whether
the
apprendi
principle
ought
to
be
in
play
for
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
and
if
there
is
any
confusion
on
that,
a
trial
judge
could
have
looked
at
apprendi
itself
where
this
court
and
justice
thomas's
concurrence
made
clear
that
there
was
unique
status
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
that
made
it
a
more
difficult
question.
however,
here
where
you
didn't
have
anything
like
that,
we
had
just
a
simple
situation
where
there
were
two
statutes,
one
maximum
for
the
ordinary
crime,
and
then
an
additional
maximum
for
the
crime
being
committed
with
aggravating
circumstances.
and
so
it
was
a
very
clear
map
line.
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in
blakely,
of
course.
it
said,
it
didn't
break
any
new
ground
in
the
decision
in
blakely.
it
simply
said
that,
took
the
state's
argument
and
rejected
it
by
saying
our
precedents
on
this
point
are
clear.
and
it
just
simply
quoted
the
apprendi
language,
that
the
statutory
maximum
for
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
is
the
maximum
that
a
defendant
may
receive
based
on
the
facts
and
the
jury
verdict
alone.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
were
lower
court
decisions?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
there
were.
and
i
think,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
these,
it
is
important
first
to
be
clear
about
what
we
are
talking
about.
there
were,
there
was
a
supreme
court
of
kansas
that
had
looked
to
the
relevant
language
in
apprendi
and
decided
that
its
sentencing
guidelines
system
could
not
stand.
and
then
you
had,
on
the
other
side
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
and
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
and
a
couple
of
other
state
intermediate
courts,
i
think
some
in
unpublished
decisions,
that
had
gone
the
other
way.
but
i
think
it
is
very
telling,
justice
ginsburg,
if
you
want
to
look
at
those
state
supreme...
i'm
sorry,
those
state
supreme
court
and
lower
court
decisions,
because
none
of
them...
not
a
single
one...
quotes
apprendi
or
even
acknowledges
the
passages
in
apprendi
that
said
the
test
is
not
one
of
form
but
of
effect.
and
there's
several
passages
in
apprendi
that
said
that
the
statutory
maximum
was
the
maximum
allowed
based
on
the
facts
in
the
jury
verdict.
so
once
you
take
those
into
account,
we
submit,
as
the
kansas
supreme
court
realized,
there
is
only
one
conclusion
that
you
can
reach.
the
only
way
those
lower
courts
were
able
to
come
to
a
contrary
decision
was
simply
to
pluck
out...
pluck
out
other
sentences
of
apprendi
and
not
acknowledge
the
rest
of
the
opinion.
and
of
course,
the
rest
of
the
opinion
where
this
court
has
these
passages,
pages
483,
482,
are
the
absolute
guts,
the
building
blocks
of
the
opinion
itself.
it
is
where
the
court
canvasses
the
historical
rule
that
was
incorporated
into
our
constitutional
system.
and
so
it
is
not
as
though
that
is
some
sort
of
dicta
that
or
loose
language
that
this
court
had
in
its
opinion.
it
was
the
very
guts
of
the
holding
of
apprendi.
and
we
submit
that,
in
a
teague
analysis
where
you
are
indeed
supposed
to
look
to
whether
a
reasonable
jurist
would
have
found
something,
not
just
the
fact
that
they
exist,
but
whether
a
reasonable
jurist
would
have
reached
a
given
conclusion,
once
you
take
the
whole
of
apprendi
into
account,
there
was
only
one
conclusion
that
a
reasonable
jurist
could
have
come
to.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think,
as
i
understand
the
dissents
in,
in
blakely,
the
dissents
in
blakely
primarily
were
saying
that
apprendi
itself
was
a
bad
idea.
and
that
apprendi
really
wasn't
dictated
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
i
see
almost
nothing,
in
fact
really
nothing
in
the
dissents
of
blakely
itself
that
says
taking
apprendi
as
the
law,
we
can
distinguish
it
from
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
was
nothing
of
that
in
the
dissents.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
stringer
test
is
helpful
because
there,
of
course,
this
court
said
that
one
of
its
prior
decisions
was
not
a
new
rule,
because
even
though
there
was
a
different
state
sentencing
system
that
slightly
different
before
the
court
in
the
subsequent
case,
the
principle
from
the
prior
case
dictated
only
one
result.
and
i
think
once
you
go
back
to
the
dissents
in
blakely
and
compare
them
let's
say,
with
the
dissents
in
booker,
on
the
merits
that
is,
in
booker,
i
think
again
it
is
telling,
because
the
dissenters
in
blakely
had
nothing
to
say
in
terms
of
a
possible
way
to
distinguish
one
case
from
the
other;
whereas
in
booker,
the
dissents
did
point
out
we
don't
have
to
extend
it
this
far.
we
can
limit
to
it
to
true
statutes
and
not
go
this
far.
so
there
is
a
difference.
really
what
this
case,
i
think
one
way
to
phrase
it
in
terms
of
what
it
comes
down
to,
is
whether
when
this
court
lays
a
decision
down
like
apprendi,
that
has
a
clear
rule
and
lots
of
historical,
robust
reasoning
behind
it,
saying
why
we
are
adopting
a
certain
rule,
whether
it
is
up
to
the
lower
courts,
in
this
case
the
state
courts,
to
second-guess
this
court
and
say
i
don't
know
if
the
court
really
means
what
it
says,
as
justice
breyer
later
put
it
in
the
blakely
dissent.
we
think
that,
we
submit
what
this
court
should
say
is
that
when
we
say
something
is
the
law,
that
lower
courts
ought
to
assume
that's
the
law,
at
least
until
we
tell
them
somehow
that
the
law
is
different.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
on
the
new
rule,
i
will
quickly
address
the
watershed
argument.
because
if
for
some
reason
this
court
adopted
the
state's
view
that
really
all
apprendi
was
was
a
highly
formalistic
rule
about
what
is
a
statutory
maximum,
and
that...
and
that
just
simply
labeling,
courts
could
have
evaded
it,
we
think
that
blakely
itself
then
has
to
be
considered
a
watershed
exception...
a
watershed
rule.
and
the
reason
why
is
because,
is
because
of
an
error
that
runs
throughout
the
state's
brief.
and
the
state's
position
is
basically
that
this
can't
be
watershed
because
apprendi
and
blakely
deal
with
circumstances
where
a
defendant
has
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
all
we're
considering
is
what
sentence
ought
to
be
imposed.
but,
of
course,
that...
that
contravenes
the
very
holding
of
apprendi
and
blakely
which
is
to
remedy
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
being
sentenced
for
a
greater
crime
than
the
jury
actually
found
him
guilty
of.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
the
watershed
realm?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
this
court
concluded
in
the
whorton
case
that
watershed
did
not
survive
aedpa,
then
of
course
you're
right,
watershed
doesn't...
can't
get
us
home
here.
but
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
as
i
understand
it,
this
court
is
considering
this
case
in
a
posture
that
it
really
dealt
with
in
horn
versus
banks
where
it
said
that
even
post
aedpa,
what
a
court
is
supposed
to
do
is
conduct
what
this
court
termed
a
threshold
teague
inquiry
as
to
whether
teague
is
satisfied.
and
of
course
in
horn,
this
court
mentioned
the
watershed
exception
itself.
so
we
think
that
what
this
court
should
really
do
is
address
that
threshold
question
to
the
extent
it
needs
to
holistically.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
say
one
word
on
jurisdiction
and
then
turn
to
two
comments
on
the
merits.
on
jurisdiction,
i
think
mr.
roberts
is
right
that
this
rarely
happens
in
the
federal
system.
it
rarely
happens
in
the
state
system.
we
can't
find
any
other
case
where
a
petitioner
has
gone
in
naming,
as
the
state
would
say,
in
effect
the
wrong
judgment
and
saying:
"i'm
challenging
this
judgment".
but
what
happened
here
was
just
that.
mr.
burton
went
in
and
said
he
was
challenging
the
1994
judgment.
and
under
this
court's
castro
decision,
when
a
pro
se
petitioner
comes
in
and
says
i'm
doing
one
thing,
in
that
case
making
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
it
can't
be
converted
into
something
else
which
is
a
first
habeas
petition
without
advising
the
petitioner.
and
here,
not
only
was
he
not
advised
by
the
trial
court
but
the
state
in
its
own
answer,
which
we
attached
to
our
reply
brief,
agreed
that
he
could
challenge
the
1994
conviction,
and
said
that
conviction
is
final,
and
he
can
challenge
that
judgment,
the
1994
judgment.
so
it's
way
too
late
in
the
day
for
the
state
to
stand
up
to
you
now
and
say
this
pro
se
petitioner
should
bear
the
burden
of
bringing
an
improper
petition.
on
the
merits,
i
don't
want
to
elaborate
beyond
simply
just
telling
this
court
that
if
you
look
at
the
hughes
decision
and
you
look
at
the
washington
decision
from
the
washington
state
courts,
it
is
clear
that
an
extra
finding
was
necessary
here,
even
if
the
only
aggravator
in
play
is
the
free
crimes
are
clearly
too
lenient
factor.
hughes
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
a
judge
needs
to
find,
and
i'm
quoting,
"extraordinarily
serious
harm
or
culpability
arising
from
the
multiple
offenses.
"
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
stands
before
you
now
and
quotes
from
parts
of
mr.
burton's
case
where
the
trial
judge
did
not
explicitly
make
that
finding,
that
only
reinforces
the
strength
of
his
habeas
petition
now,
that
under
washington
state
law,
the
judge
needed
to
make
that
kind
of
an
extra
finding
and
the
judge
didn't
do
so.
let
me
finally
turn
to
a
discussion
about
whether
this
court's
treatment
of
walton
and
apprendi
could
have
given
a
state
judge
a
reasonable
basis
to
distinguish
the
system
at
issue
in
blakely.
we
don't
think
it
could
because
this
court
didn't
simply
say
in
apprendi
that
walton
stands.
it
explicitly
said
the
reason
why
the
arizona
capital
system
as
we
understand
it
is
okay
is
because
it's
nothing
more
than
a
system
that
is
permissible
under
williams
against
new
york.
it's
one
where
on
the
basis
of
the
jury's
finding
of
guilt
that
the
death
penalty
is
permissible
without
anything
else.
and
so
the
only
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
justice
o'connor's
dissent
was
as
to
the
way
arizona's
system
worked,
but
any
judge
that
would
have
looked
at
apprendi
would
have
seen,
the
majority
is
telling
us
that
a
system
is
okay
so
long
as
the
jury
verdict
itself
allows
the
ultimate
sentence.
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
system
that
was
not
in
place
in
washington,
so
a
judge
should
have
full
well
realized.
and
of
course
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
once
it
became
clear
to
this
court
the
way
that
arizona's
capital
sentencing
system
functioned,
this
court
had
little
difficulty
simply
applying
the
apprendi
rule
and
agreeing
that
that
system
had
to
be
invalid
too.
and
just
like
the
blakely
decision
itself,
not
even
the
dissenters
suggested
that
apprendi
dictated
otherwise.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
case.
