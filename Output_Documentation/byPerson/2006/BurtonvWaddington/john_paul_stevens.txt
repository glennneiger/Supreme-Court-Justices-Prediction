justice

paul
stevens
but,
mr.
fisher,
even
if
it's
true
that
there
are
other
examples
out
there
that
might
qualify
for
that
example,
it's
not
true
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
particular
case,
there
was...
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
additional
finding
of
fact,
even
though
there
may
be
cases
out
there
in
which
you
could
get
consecutive
sentences
without
an
additional
finding
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
necessarily
true.
isn't
it
also
possible
if,
at
the
time
of
the
first
judgment
the
judge
could
have
said,
well
you
really
haven't
exhausted
your
remedies
because
it
is
not
final
until
the
whole
thing
is
over.
but
nevertheless,
because
exhaustion
is
not
a
jurisdictional
matter,
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing
about
that?
so
you're
saying
at
the
time
he
filed
the
petition
on
december
28,
1998,
he
had
already
had,
the
second
judgment
had
already
been
entered
by
the
washington
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pursuant
to
the
reversal
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
second
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
you
can
give
me
just
a
little
more
help
on
this.
the
finding
number
18
that
you
referred
to
says
in
substance,
if
by
just
sentencing
him
on
the
basis
of
the
jury
verdict
he
won't
get...
he'll
get
a
free
pass.
but
it
doesn't
say
the
judge
can...
could
therefore
increase
the
sentence.
it
seems
to
me
there
had
to
be
additional
findings
that
justify
a
result
that
he
thought
would
have
been
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
just
having
pointed
out
that
he
would
get
a
pass
would
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
consecutive
sentences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
he
did
make
additional
findings.
it
goes
on.
in
fact,
19
and
20
are
additional
findings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
nowhere
says
they're
unnecessary
either.
