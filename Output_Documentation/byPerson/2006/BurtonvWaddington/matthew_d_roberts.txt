mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
begin
by
addressing
the
issues
that
you
were
just
talking
about,
there
was
a
distinction
that
the
court
could
have
drawn
between
apprendi
and
blakely
and
that
reasonable
jurists
could
have
drawn
and
did
draw.
one
was
the
formal
distinction
that
you
were
discussing
before
with
the
state,
which
was
supported
by
justice
o'connor's
proposing
that
as
an
interpretation
in
her
dissent
and
the
majority
not
responding
to
that,
that
that
distinction
was
contrary
to
the
rule
but
implausible,
but
in
fact
accepting
the...
accepting
that
it
was
a
plausible
distinction
and
saying
that
it
still
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference,
that
the
apprendi
rule
still
was
important.
the
second...
and
in
addition
to
that,
that
distinction
that
justice
o'connor
drew
there
was
consistent
with
the
apprendi
court's
distinction
of
walton.
and
you
have
to
look
at
what
reasonable
jurists
could
have
interpreted
looking
at
that
decision
at
the
time
with
those
distinctions
and
what
the
court
said
in
apprendi.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
more
than
a
formal
distinction
that
could
have
been
drawn
between
the
system
in
apprendi
and
the
washington
guidelines
system.
that's
the
distinction
that
we
proposed
in
our
amicus
brief
in
blakely
and
it
rested
on
the
fact
that
sentencing
guideline
systems
like
washington
try
to
channel
but
not
to
eliminate
the
discretion
that
sentencing
judges
have
to
sentence
within
the
otherwise
applicable
limits.
and
in
the
washington
system
the
sentencing
judge
retained
a
significant
degree
of
discretion
that
reasonable
jurists
could
have
analogized
to
traditional
sentencing
systems
that
aren't
constrained
by
apprendi.
the
facts,
the
facts
on
which
the
judge
could
rely
to
go
above
the
guidelines,
were
not
specified
as
in
apprendi
and
as
in
ring
by
the
legislature,
but
it
was
a
wide
open
set
that
enabled
the
judge
himself
or
herself
to
determine
what
facts
the
judge
thought
could
justify
a
higher
sentence;
and
in
addition,
the
facts
alone
didn't
trigger
the
higher
sentence.
the
judge
had
to
look
at
those
facts
and
make
the
additional
determination
that
those
facts
rose
to
the
level
of
substantial
and
compelling
reasons
that
justified
the
higher
sentence.
in
that
respect,
the
judge
had
a
degree
of
sentencing
discretion
to
decide
what
facts
justified
it
and
whether
it
was
in
fact
justified.
now,
of
course,
this
court
rejected
those
distinctions
in
blakely.
but
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
jurist
could
have
accepted
those
distinctions
and
drawn
a
difference,
and
we
submit
that
they
could
have.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
don't
have
a
position
on
that
precise,
on
that
particular
issue
here,
because
it
can't
arise
for
federal
prisoners.
but
let
me
explain
why
it
can't
arise
for
federal
prisoners
because
perhaps
that
will
give
the
court
some
guidance
in
resolving
the
issue.
in
the
federal
system,
it's
well
established
that
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
are
part
of
a
unitary
judgment
and
that
that
unitary
judgment
doesn't
become
final
until
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
have
both
been
fully
adjudicated.
that
understanding
is
reflected
in
the
language
of
28
u.s.c.
2255,
which
is
the
statute
that
authorizes
collateral
attacks
by
federal
prisoners.
that
statute
authorizes
attacks...
what
it
authorizes
is
motions
to
vacate,
set
aside,
or
correct
a
sentence.
so
it's
clear
from
that
that
it's
not
authorizing
collateral
attacks
on
a
conviction
independent
of
the
attendant
sentence.
and
i
think
that
could
shed
some
guidance
here,
because
2255
was
intended
to
be
a
parallel
and
substitute
remedy
to
traditional
habeas
for
federal
prisoners.
i
would
also
make
a
point
on
the
other
sort
of
preliminary
issues
that
were
being
discussed
on
the
consecutive
sentence
issue,
that
it's
not
only
the
fact
that
the
judge
said
that
the
multiple
offense
policy
standing
alone
could
justify
the
consecutive
sentence
here
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
that
in
upholding
that.
but
the
court
of
appeals
went
further,
because
petitioner
had
made
a
separate
challenge
to...
and
this
is
on
page
52
and
53
of
the
joint
appendix.
petitioner
made
a
separate
challenge
to
the
other
two
aggravating
factors.
petitioner
argued
that
the
district
court
wasn't
allowed
to
rely
on...
excuse
me,
the
trial
court
couldn't
rely
on
those
two
other
aggravating
factors
because
he
had
not
relied
on
them
in
the
original
sentencing
and
this
was
a
resentencing.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
challenge
and
it
rejected
that
challenge
because
it
said
the
sentencing
court
concluded
that
the
multiple
offense
policy
alone
justified
the
exceptional
sentence,
and
then
on
page
53
it
said:
"the
sentencing
court
did
not
rely
on
the
additional
aggravating
factors
for
imposing
an
exceptional
sentence.
"
so
i
think
these--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
that
is
how--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
trial
court
said
each
of
the
three
standing
alone
was
sufficient.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
these
other
two
have
been
challenged,
but
these
other
two
are...
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
this
challenge
to
these
other
two
factors
because
they're
out
of
the
case.
so
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
take
the
case
as
coming
from...
coming
from
the
washington
courts
as
if
what
the
courts
essentially
said
is
those
other
two
are
not
in
the
case
any
more.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
what
the
washington
appellate
court
essentially,
they
could
have
said
petitioner
is
right,
those
other
two
aggravating
factors
couldn't
be
relied
on,
and
so
we're
relying
on
this
the
standing
alone.
what
they
chose
to
do
is,
we're
going
to
interpret
what
the
trial
court
did
as
relying
only
on
the
one.
and
that
was
the
basis
for
responding
to
that
claim
of
error,
and
i
do
think
that
the
court
has
to
take
this
case
as
coming
on
that
basis.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
issue
of
blakely
retroactivity
for
a
few
minutes.
in
addition
to
the
points
that
i
made
before
about
why
blakely
was
a
new
rule,
i
would
also
submit
that
blakely
is
not
a
watershed
rule
because
it's
not
a
bedrock
rule
that's
essential
to
a
fair
trial,
and
rules
are
only
bedrock
if
they
approach
the
fundamental
and
sweeping
importance
of
gideon,
and
blakely
doesn't
have
that
kind
of
importance
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
right
to
counsel
pervasively
affects
every
aspect
of
the
trial,
but
blakely
affects
only
the
procedure
for
determining
the
punishment
of
defendants
who
have
already
been
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
all
the
elements
of
a
crime.
second,
a
felony
trial
in
which
the
defendant
is
denied
counsel
is
inherently
unfair,
but
it's
not
inherently
unfair
to
use
the
preponderance
standard
to
find
facts
that
determine
the
extent
of
punishment,
and
in
fact
the
constitution
permits
the
use
of
a
preponderance
standard
to
find
many
facts
that
have
as
much
or
more
impact
on
punishment
as
facts
covered
by
blakely.
those
include
facts
that
trigger
mandatory
minimums,
facts
on
which
a
judge
relies
to
sentence
within
a
broad
statutory
range,
and
even
facts
on
which
a
judge
relies
to
sentence
above
the
standard
range
in
advisory
guideline
systems.
third,
counsel
is
so
essential
to
a
fair
trial
that
deprivation
of
the
right
can
never
be
discounted
as
harmless
error.
but
this
court
held
in
recuenco
that
blakely
errors
can
be
harmless,
and
in
reaching
that
holding
the
court
expressly
concluded
that
blakely
errors
do
not
necessarily
render
a
criminal
trial
fundamentally
unfair
or
an
unreliable
vehicle
for
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
that
conclusion
seems
to
strongly
suggest
that
blakely
is
not
a
bedrock
rule
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
