justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
extra
culpability,
do
you
mean
the
nature
of
the
crime?
suppose
there
are
three
crimes
all
committed
at
the
same
time...
murder,
rape,
and
kidnapping.
they're
all
very
serious
crimes.
and
if
you
sentence
them
consecutively,
you
will
take
into
account
that
there
were
three.
if
you
sentence
them
concurrently,
it
doesn't
matter.
the
washington
court
says,
we're
not
just
looking
to
the
fact
that
murder
or
rape
or
kidnapping
are
serious;
we're
looking
to
sentence
consecutively
if
do
you
more
than
that.
you
have
to
look
to
see
that
the
kidnapping
was
a
special
kind
of
kidnapping.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fact
is,
we're
looking
at
page
34,
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
is
the
first
petition
that
was
filed;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
look
at
it
and
it
says,
filed
december
28,
and
maybe
this
is
what
you
said.
then
it
says
date
of
judgment
of
conviction,
december
16,
1994.
so
looking
at
that,
you'd
think
that
is
what
he
was
attacking.
where
does
it
say
he's
attacking
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
imagine
there
are
tens
of
thousands
off
petitions
filed
in
the
federal
system.
and
i
would
think
that
judges
when
they're
trying
to
look
at
those
petitions,
or
the
magistrate
looks
at
them
and
says
what
judgment
are
you
attacking,
he
has
to
figure
that
out
often
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes,
or
some
other
purpose.
he'd
look
over
there,
go
down
and
read
that
line
two,
and
he'd
think
yeah,
that's
the
judgment
that's
being
attacked,
unless
of
course
there's
some
indication
that
it's
something
else.
i've
never
heard
of
this
before.
is
there
any
precedent
on
that
where
even
though
the
petition
refers
to
date
a,
and
there's
nothing
in
to
suggest
anything
other
than
date
a,
because
it
turns
out
that
there's
a
different
judgment
that
in
fact,
he's
being
held,
which
is
date
b,
that
the
court
says
oh,
you're
attacking
date
b.
is
there
any
precedent
that
says
that's
how
it's
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
this
might
be
the
first
time.
i
don't
see
a
reason
why
you
wouldn't
read
the
petition
that's
filed
in
an
ordinary
way
and
say
the
judgment
that's
being
attacked
is
the
judgment
that
it
refers
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
implication
this
is
going
to
have
for
a
lot
of
these
petitions.
i
don't
know
one
way
or
the
other,
but
it
might
be
there
are
thousands
right
now
in
the
federal
court
which
have
date
a,
and
somebody
is
going
to
go
back
and
say
no,
it
is
really
date
b
or
something.
i'm
a
little
nervous
about
it.
if
you're
not
nervous,
you're
the
ones
in
charge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
take
you
up.
let
me
just
have
one
on
the
merits,
one.
i
mean,
the
reason
i
want
you
to
get
to
the
merits,
and
i
put
in
my
dissent.
i
was
trying
as
hard
as
i
could
to
show
why
i
thought
this
case
was
wrong.
i
start
the
dissent
by
saying
that...
what
it
says,
and
then
i
quote
the
two
sentences
that
any
fact,
et
cetera,
any
fact
that
increases
beyond
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum
must
be
submitted
to
a
jury
and
prescribed
statutory
maximum,
again
quote,
means
"solely
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict.
"
okay.
then
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
i
say:
"until
now
i
would
have
thought
the
court
might
have
limited
apprendi
so
its
underlying
principle
wouldn't
cause
so
much
harm.
"
now,
the
next
sentence
of
course
i
explain
how
they
might
have
limited
apprendi,
but
somehow
that
disappeared
from
the
opinion
because
i
guess
i
couldn't
think
of
it.
so
you're
going
to
tell
me
now...
i
mean,
i
didn't
say
how
they
might
have
limited
apprendi
and
i
couldn't
think
of
how
they
might
have
limited
apprendi,
and
they
read
apprendi
to
mean
what
it
said.
now,
you
tell
me
the
phrase
i
might
have
put
in
but
couldn't
think
of
that
would
have
limited
apprendi?
