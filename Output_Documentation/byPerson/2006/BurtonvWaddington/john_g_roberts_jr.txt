chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
burton
versus
stewart.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that.
i
mean,
we
have
not
held,
for
example,
that
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
is
something
that
has
to
be
submitted
to
a
jury
under
blakely.
why,
if
you're
determining
that
sentences
run
consecutively,
isn't
that
just
the
same
as
looking
at
a
simultaneous
conviction
and
saying
they're
going
to
run
consecutively?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you'd
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
you're
saying
that
that
extra
finding
can't
simply
be
that
this
is
a
conviction
for
a
particular
serious
crime
that's
going
to
go
unpunished
otherwise?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
under
this
system
if
you
had
a
regime
where
if
you're
convicted
of
murder
and
you've
been
convicted
of
rape
before
that,
you
get
an
enhanced
sentence
beyond
the
normal
murder
sentence,
that
would
not
contravene
blakely.
but
if
you're
convicted
at
the
same
time
for
rape
and
murder
and
those
two
sentences
run
consecutively,
you
say
that
that
does
violate
blakely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
blakely
was
not
a
new
rule
but
booker
was?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
argument,
this
argument
assumes
that
we
rule
against
you
on
whether
or
not
it
is
a
new
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
you
have...
don't
you
have
to
address
aedpa
before
we
get
to
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
matter
it
it's
a
watershed,
i
guess
it
is
a
point
of
argument,
but
it
is
not
clear
that
it
matters
whether
it
is
a
watershed
rule
if
you
read
aedpa
2254(d)(1)
by
its
terms.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter...
i'm
looking
at
joint
appendix
page
34,
date
of
judgment
of
conviction,
he
puts
in
december
16,
1994.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
it
say
a
new
judgment
was
issued
in
march
of
'98?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
thought
you
meant
it
was
in
his
petition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
further,
i
thought
you
told
me
that
the
petition
goes
on
to
indicate
that
the
conviction
while
affirmed,
that
the
sentence
was
reversed,
looking
at
9(b)
on
joint
appendix--
35.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
in
other--
words,
he
details
in
the
petition
the
subsequent
history--
that
would
have
resulted
in
a
new
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
roberts,
do
you
have
a
position
on
whether
we
have
a
successive
petition
problem
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
today
we
also
decide
case
no.
05-9222
burton
v.
stuart
in
a
per
curiam
opinion.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
our
decision
in
2004
in
blakely
v.
washington
announced
a
new
rule
and
if
so,
whether
it
applies
retroactively
to
prisoners
seeking
federal
habeas
relief.
we
do
not
answer
these
questions
however
because
we
conclude
that
the
petition
in
this
case
is
a
second
or
successive
petition
under
the
federal
habeas
statute.
the
petition
challenges
the
same
custody
imposed
by
the
same
judgment
as
an
earlier
petition.
the
federal
habeas
statute
requires
a
prisoner
who
wishes
to
file
such
a
second
or
successive
petition
in
district
court
to
first
authorization
from
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
here
did
not
seek,
much
less
obtained
this
authorization.
accordingly
under
the
federal
habeas
statute
the
district
court
could
not
entertain
the
petition.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
with
instructions
to
direct
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
habeas
petition
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
our
per
curiam
opinion
is
unanimous.
