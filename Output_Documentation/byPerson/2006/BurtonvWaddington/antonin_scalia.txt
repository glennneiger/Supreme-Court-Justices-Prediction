why
does
it
make
any
less
sense
to
allow
separate
habeas
challenges
to,
first,
the
conviction,
and
then
the
sentence,
than
it
does
to
allow
separate
appeals
to
this
court
from
each
of
those?
and
once
again
under
the
statute,
we
entertain
appeals
only
from
final
judgment,
but
you
can
bring
here
on
certiorari
the
judgment
of
conviction,
even
though
proceedings
for
the
sentence
are
still
in
progress.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
fortiori,
we
have
a
lot
more
control
over
habeas
corpus,
which
is
an
equitable
remedy,
than
we
do
over,
what
is
it,
1257,
our
jurisdictional
statute
under
certiorari.
why
does
it
make
any
more
sense
for
habeas
purposes
to
insist
that
he
await
the
final
sentence
before
he
gets
review
of
the
premise
for
that
sentence,
namely
the
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
he
can't
later
bring
any
claim
about
the
sentence?
