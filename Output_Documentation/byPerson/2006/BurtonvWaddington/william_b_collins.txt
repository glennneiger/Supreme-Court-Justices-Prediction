mr.
william
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
where
justice
ginsburg
began,
with
the
issue
of
successive
petitions.
we
believe
that
the
petition
before
this
court
is
a
successive
petition
barred
under
aedpa.
now
my
brother,
mr.
fisher
says
that
it's
not
a
successive
petition
because
the
first
petition
challenged
the
1994
judgment.
but
that
is
simply
not
correct
as
a
matter
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
a
new
judgment
was
entered
in
march
of
1998.
that
judgment
was
entered
as
a
result
of
mr.
burton's
conviction
being
affirmed
and
his
sentence
being
reversed.
so
when
he
was
in
custody,
when
he
filed
his
first
petition,
he
was
in
custody
pursuant
to
that
amended
judgment.
mr.
william
b.
collins
exactly,
your
honor.
so
he
has
an
amended
judgment
filed
in
march
of
1998.
he
files
his
first
petition
challenging
his
conviction
under
that
petition.
later,
in
2002,
he
files
a
second
petition
challenging
his
sentence.
mr.
william
b.
collins
he
does
put
that
in,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that's
determinative.
if
you
take
a
look
at
page
35,
on
question
8,
they
say,
did
you
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
conviction?
answer,
yes.
if
you
did
appeal,
answer
the
following.
and
it
lays
out
the
facts
that
he
appealed,
that
his
conviction
was
affirmed,
that
his
sentence
was
reversed,
and
then
a
new
judgment
is
entered
in
march
of
1998.
he
is
not
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
1994
judgment.
he
is
in
custody--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
3,
which
shows
that--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--no,
no,
it
wasn't
in
his
petition,
your
honor,
but
it
doesn't
seem...
the
fact
that
he
was
looking
back
at
his
conviction,
original
conviction
being
1994,
and
that's
what
he
wrote
down,
doesn't
mean
that
that
was
the
conviction
and
that
was
the
judgment
under
which
he
was
in
custody,
because
it
simply
wasn't.
the
original
1994
judgment
no
longer
existed
because
a
new
judgment
had
been
entered.
so
because...
and
i
don't
think...
i
think
what
we
disagree
about
in
this
is
which
judgment,
if
the
first
petition
went
to
the
first...
to
the
1994
judgment,
and
the
second
petition
went
to
the
1998
judgment,
then
we
would
agree
with
mr.
fisher
that
it
is
not
successive.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
i
heard
him
say
that
if
you
agree
with
us,
that
the
only
judgment
in
existence
at
the
time
he
filed
his
petition
was
the
1998
judgment.
then
he's
filed
a
successive
petition
with
regard
to
that
judgment,
one
in
december
of
1998
dealing
with
the
conviction;
a
second
in
2002,
dealing
with
the
sentence.
so
since
it's
a
successive
petition
and
mr.
burton
did
not
go
through
the
gatekeeping
function
that
aedpa
requires,
there
is
no...
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
subsequently,
we
believe
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
say
he's
attacking
anything
else,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
when
he
filed
this
petition,
he
was
not
being
confined--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
precedent.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
say
the
judgment
that's
being
attacked
is
the
judgment
by
which
he's
being
confined.
i
mean,
he--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
right,
your
honor.
next
i
would
like
to
go
briefly
to
the
question
that
justice
souter
asked
about--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--it
had
been
entered
by
the
trial
court,
your
honor,
so
he--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--exactly,
your
honor.
that
sentence
is
on
page...
if
you
look
at
page
3
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
is
the
second
amended
judgment
filed
in
the
superior
court
in
washington
on
march
16,
1998,
and
he
was
confined
under
the
authority
of
this
judgment.
mr.
william
b.
collins
of
the
second
judgment.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
there
the
court--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
a
couple
things
are
being
confused
here.
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
first
thing
is
when...
is
this
a
successive...
is
this
a
successive
petition,
and
we
would
say
it
is,
because
he
filed
the
first
one
and
then
the
second
one.
now
the
question
of
whether
he
can
get
relief
under
the
first...
under
his
first
habeas
petition
does
not
depend
on
the
entry
of
a
final
judgment.
in
fact,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
judgment
was
entered
in
march
of
1998.
in
december
of
1998,
he
filed
his
first
petition.
and
in
fact,
the
first
petition
was
denied
in
april
of
2000
on
the
merits,
because
it
had
been
exhausted,
he
didn't
have
to
wait
for
that,
because
those
claims
were
exhausted
and
because
they
were
ripe,
because
they...
the
factual
predicates
had
occurred
in
the
trial
court,
then
that
was
all
that
was
required
for
him
to
bring
those
claims.
he
didn't
have
to
wait
for
a
final
judgment.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
because
congress
in
aedpa
has
declared
that
you
have
to
bring
all
of
your
claims
in
your...
at
one
time,
and
if
you
don't,
then
your
petition
should
be
dismissed
as
successive,
unless
you
go
through
the
gatekeeping
solution.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
so
i
just
briefly
want
to
go,
justice
souter,
to
where
you
started
about
the
consecutive
sentence
issue.
we
believe
that
consecutive
sentence
is
quite
different
than,
from
what
exists
in
blakely
and
that,
in
fact,
there
aren't
really
additional
findings
of
fact.
i
think
you
referred
to
about
the
crime,
about
the
circumstances,
about
the
character.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
finding
of
fact
entered
by
the
trial
court
in
order
to
justify
the
exceptional
sentence...
this
is
on
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix,
finding
of
fact
18...
if
the
court
were
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
a
standard
range
sentence
on
each
count
run
concurrently,
he
would
receive
the
same
punishment
as
if
he
had
committed
only
the
rape
in
the
first
degree.
this
would
effectively
result
in
the
free
crimes
of
robbery
in
the
first
degree
and
burglary
in
the
first
degree
because
he
would
receive
no
additional
penalty
for
those
crimes.
now--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
your
honor,
the
sentence
could
have
been
run
consecutively
because
of
an
aggravating
factor.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
trial
court
judge,
in
fact,
had
three
independent
and
separate
reasons
for
running
the
sentence
consecutively.
two
of
those
would
be,
i
think
we
would
say
aggravating
factors
that
the
blakely
reasoning
would
apply
to.
but
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
considered
this
case
only
looked
at
the
free
crimes
element
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
think
it
would,
and
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
this
decision.
mr.
william
b.
collins
your
honor,
i
think...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
he
did
make
additional
findings.
but--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
at
page
52
and
53
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
the
court
of
appeals
looks
at
the
sentence,
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
is,
"nonetheless,
the
sentencing
court
concluded
that
the
multiple
offender
policy
alone
justified
the
exceptional
sentence.
"
"the
fact
that
the
defendant
offender
score
for
rape
in
the
first
degree
is
16,
thus
invoking
the
multiple
offense
policy
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
standing
alone,
is
a
substantial
and
compelling
reason
and
justification
for
imposing
the
exceptional
sentence
here.
"
mr.
william
b.
collins
exactly.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
that
consecutive
sentence
on
the
free
crimes
was...
standing
alone
would
have
been
sufficient.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
could
have
said
that
the
definition
of
"statutory
maximum"
is
the
traditional
statutory
maximum
that
was
at
issue
in
apprendi.
and
in
fact
in
the
apprendi
decision
the
court
specifically,
i
think
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
dissent,
explained
that
walton
versus
arizona
was
still
good
law.
and
as
you
know,
in
walton
the
jury
would
find
somebody
guilty
of
aggravated
first
degree
murder,
but
they
could
not
receive
the
death
penalty
unless
the
judge
made
additional
findings
in
a
hearing.
and
it
seemed
to
say
that
the
statutory
maximum
was
death
and
that
in
fact
the
judge's
findings
would
not
take
you
above
that
statutory
maximum.
i
think
that--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--it
was
overturned
in
ring,
your
honor.
but
when
you
had
lower
court
appellate
judges
looking
at
your
decision
in
apprendi
and
seeing
the
fact
that
walton
and
apprendi
were
consistent,
it
was
logical
for
them
to
conclude,
as
virtually
every
single
court
did
except
for
kansas,
that
the
definition
of
"statutory
maximum"
was
the
traditional
statutory
maximum
that
was
in
apprendi.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
souter,
only
because
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
explained
in
her
dissent,
there
are
two
ways
to
read
apprendi,
and
one
of
those
ways
would
result
in
upholding
guideline
systems
which
are
now
invalid
because
of
blakely
and
booker,
but
really
quite
different
from
apprendi
because
those
systems
involve
what
you
would
call
guided
discretion.
that
is,
in
apprendi
if
you
wanted
the
aggravating
factor
if
the
judge
found
it
by
a
preponderance
then
the
sentence
was
enhanced.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
believe
it
definitely
would
have
been
something
new,
your
honor.
