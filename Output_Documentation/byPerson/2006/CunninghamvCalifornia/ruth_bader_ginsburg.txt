justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that,
why
is
that
so?
why
isn't
the
middle
sentence,
just
like
what
the
guideline...
what
the
guideline
would
indicate?
and
if
a
federal
court
would
say,
if
i
sentence
within
the
guideline,
that
will
be
presumptively
valid,
as
many
courts
have
held.
not
this
court
yet.
that
would
be
presumptively
valid.
and
if
i
go
outside,
i
have
to
give
a
reason
that
will
survive
appellate
review.
well,
why
isn't
the
middle
sentence
identical
in
function
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
advice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
you
think
would
be
necessary,
what
would
be
the
least
change
california
would
have
to
make
to
bring
its
system
into
compliance
with
our
decisions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
can't
be
a
fact...
in
california,
it
can't
be
a
fact
found
by
the
jury,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out.
that's
a
significant
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
cunningham
against
california,
no.
05-6551.
john
cunningham
was
tried
in
the
california
state
court
and
convicted
by
a
jury
of
a
grade
b
felony.
under
california’s
determinate
sentencing
law
(dsl)
cunningham’s
crime
was
punishable
by
one
of
three
precise
terms
of
imprisonment,
a
lower-term
sentence
of
6
years,
a
middle-term
of
12
years,
or
an
upper-term
of
16
years.
the
dsl
required
the
trial
judge
to
sentence
cunningham
to
the
12
year
middle-term
and
nothing
more
unless
the
judge
found
at
least
one
additional
fact
in
aggravation
of
the
event.
the
judge
found
by
preponderance
of
evidence
several
aggravating
facts
but
only
one
mitigating
fact
concluding
that
the
aggravator
outweighed
the
sole
mitigator,
the
judge
sentenced
cunningham
to
the
upper
term
of
16
years.
the
california
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
harsher
sentence.
we
reverse
that
disposition
because
the
four
year
sentence
alleviation
based
solely
on
a
judge’s
fact
finding
denied
cunningham
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
trial
by
jury.
in
apprendi
v.
new
jersey,
we
held
that
under
the
sixth
amendment
any
fact
other
than
a
prior
conviction
that
exposes
a
defendant
to
a
sentence
above
the
otherwise
applicable
statutory
maximum
must
be
found
by
a
jury
,not
a
judge,
for
other
this
sentence
elevating
facts
must
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
by
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
four
years
later
in
blakely
v.
washington
we
applied
the
rule
stated
in
apprendi
to
the
washington
sentencing
reform
act
under
that
act
the
maximum
penalty
for
blakely’s
offense,
was
10
years
imprisonment
but
if
the
trial
judge
found
no
facts
beyond
those
reflected
in
the
jury’s
verdict
blakely
could
not
receive
a
sentence
above
a
standard
range
of
49
to
53
months.
blakely
was
sentenced
to
90
months
imprison
based
on
the
judge’s
finding
of
deliberate
cruelty.
applying
the
rule
recognized
in
apprendi
we
held
like
these
sentence
unconstitutional.
last
term
in
united
states
v.
booker
we
held
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
unconstitutional
as
a
mandatory
system.
there
was
no
meaningful
distinction
we
observe
between
the
federal
guidelines
and
the
washington
system
invalidated
in
blakely.
both
systems
exposed
defendants
to
greater
punishment
based
solely
on
facts
found
by
judges
not
juries.
as
a
remedy
for
the
sixth
amendment
violation
we
determine
that
the
federal
guideline
should
remain
operative
but
as
advisory
only
informing
but
not
finding
the
trial
judge.
we
also
held
that
sentences
imposed
under
an
advisory
guidelines
regime
could
be
subject
to
appellate
review
or
reasonableness.
in
all
material
respect,
california’s
dsl
resembles
the
sentencing
systems
invalidated
in
blakely
and
booker
because
aggravating
facts
that
authorize
the
upper-term
are
found
by
the
judge
under
california
system
and
maybe
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
assessment
less
confining
then
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
we
hold
that
the
dsl
violates
the
rules
stated
in
apprendi.
in
people
v.
black,
the
california
supreme
court
attempted
to
rescue
the
dsl’s
judicial
factfinding
authorization
by
describing
the
system
as
imposing
only
a
reasonableness
constraint
equivalent
to
the
constraint
operative
in
the
federal
system
for
booker.
the
reasonableness
check
the
booker
court
anticipated
however
would
operates
within
constitutional
constraints
delineated
in
this
court’s
precedent
and
not
as
a
substitute
for
those
constraints.
because
the
dsl
allocates
to
judges
sole
authority
to
find
facts
on
which
the
imposition
of
an
upper
term
sentence
turns
the
system
violates
the
sixth
amendment.
the
remedy
prescribed
in
booker,
in
short,
is
not
properly
regarded
as
a
recipe
for
rendering
this
court’s
sixth
amendment
case
law
toothless.
as
to
the
adjustment
of
california
sentencing
system
in
light
of
our
ruling
the
ball
lies
in
california’s
court.
several
states
have
modified
their
systems
in
the
wake
of
apprendi
and
blakely
to
retain
determinate
sentencing,
by
calling
upon
the
jury
to
find
any
fact
necessary
to
the
imposition
of
an
elevated
sentence.
other
states
have
chosen
to
permit
judges
genuinely
“to
exercise
broad
discretion
within
a
statutory
range”,
for
example
a
range
running
from
6-16
years
without
a
mandatory
middle.
california
may
follow
the
path
taken
by
its
sister
states
or
otherwise
alter
its
system,
so
long
as
it
observes
sixth
amendment
limitations
declared
in
this
court’s
decisions.
