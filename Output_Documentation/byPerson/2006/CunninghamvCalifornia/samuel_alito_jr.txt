justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
the
distinction
between
the
california
system
and
a
system
of
advisory
guidelines
with
reasonableness
appellate
review.
let's
take
a
hypothetical
case
where
the
statutory
range
after
convictions
on
multiple
counts
is
zero
to
a
hundred
years.
and
let's
say
you
have
two
judges
who
have
these
cases.
and
one
sentences
the
defendant
to
zero,
probation.
the
other
one
sentences
the
defendant
to
a
hundred
years.
without
saying
a
word
of
explanation
for
either
sentence,
isn't
the
appellate
court
in
that
situation
going
to
say,
you
have
to
tell
us
why
you
have
chosen
zero
or
why
you
have
chosen
100?
and
if
the
trial
judge
provides
an
explanation,
isn't
the
trial
judge
necessarily
going
to
be
reciting
certain
facts
that
the
judge
believes
to
be
true
about
the
offense
and
the
offender?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
it
reviewed
for
reasonableness...
isn't
the
reasonableness
review
necessarily
going
to
require
what
is,
in
essence,
fact-finding
by
the
trial
judge,
and
a
review
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
sentence
in
light
of
those
facts
by
an
appellate
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
any
guideline
system,
whether
it's
mandatory
or
advisory,
once...
if
you
have
a
mandatory
system
or
an
advisory
system
with
appellate
review,
once
the
appellate
review
function
has
been
performed,
will
it
not
be
the
case
that
trial
judges
will
not
have
unfettered
discretion,
will
have
very
limited
discretion
in
choosing,
making
these
sentencing
policy
determinations?
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
a
guidelines
system.
that
the
individual
trial
judges
don't
get
to
decide,
you
know,
how
much
deterrence
they
think
is
necessary,
or
how
severe
they
think
an
individual
crime
is,
that
there's
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
uniformity.
