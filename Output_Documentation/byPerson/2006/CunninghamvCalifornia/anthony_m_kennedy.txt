justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
position
was
that
aggravation
must
be
reasonable.
what
the
court
in
black
indicates
is
that
it
is
not
going
to
consider
anything
reasonable
unless
there's
a
fact
to
support
it,
unless
there's
a
finding
of
fact
to
support
it.
is
that
the
position
you
take?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
that
there's
the
further
indication
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
deemed
reasonable
unless
it
is
supported
by
a
finding
of
fact,
as
indicated
in
order
to
support
one
of
the
specific
guideline
aggravators.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
way
the
black
court
interpreted
it.
the
black
court
talked
about
a
requirement
that
the
upper-term
sentence
be
imposed
only
if
an
aggravating
factor
exists.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
whole
problem
with
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
there's...
and
incidentally,
under
the
rules,
under
4.410,
those
are
general
objectives
of
sentencing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
a
term
of
art
that's
different
from
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
only
the
circumstances
that
have
to
be
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
general
objectives
can
still
be
considered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
we
are
involved
with
in
this
case
and
with
this
criminal,
whose
conviction
and
sentence
we're
reviewing
here,
are
circumstances
that
aggravate,
and
these
do
require
findings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
those
findings
aren't
there,
it's
not
reasonable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
is
the
same
old
record
we've
been
playing.
but
the
reasonableness
requirement
has
to
be
explained
further.
and
when
you
explain
it
further,
you
find
that
there
must
be
findings
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
for
any
of
the
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances
that
are
set
out.
that's
different
from
the
objectives
of
sentencing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
objectives
of
sentencing
are
not
what's
involved
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
excluding
capital
cases,
in
your
view...
anecdotally,
if
it
has
to
be
that...
what
percentage
of
cases
that
go
to
juries,
that
go
to
jury
trial,
result
in
bifurcated
proceedings
for
sentencing
purposes?
10
percent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
you
had
200,000
incarcerated
when
i
last
looked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
a
reading
of
the
rule
indicates
under
(b),
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
that
the
judge
could
take
into
account
these
policy
objectives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it
is
true
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we're
under
4.420.
