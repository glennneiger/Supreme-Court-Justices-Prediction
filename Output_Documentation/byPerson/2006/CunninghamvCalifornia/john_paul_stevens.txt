mr.
gold,
i
know
you
take
that
position
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
could
be
cases
in
which
the
verdict
of
the
jury
would
establish
certain
facts
that
would
justify
going
beyond
the
middle
term?
for
example,
the
black
case
itself,
as
the
justice
who
dissented
in
this
case
thought
the
sentence
was
permissible
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
clarify
one
thing?
you
mean
that
a
rash
of
crimes
committed
by
people
other
than
the
defendant
could
be
an
aggravating
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
nothing
in
california
law
suggesting
that
that
would
be
upheld,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
unless
the
california
legislature
does
what
most
states
have
done
in
response
to
booker,
which
is
not
that
route
at
all.
they
did
maintain
their
determinate
sentencing,
but
they
just
required
the
jury
finding.
that's
what
i
think
seven
out
of
nine
states
have
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is,
in
the
federal
system,
the
judge
can
go
above
and
it
can
be
reasonable
based
on
facts
that
were
found
by
the
jury.
but
in
california,
to
go
beyond
the
middle
range
up
to
the
upper
range,
it
must
be
a
fact
not
found
by
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
but
whatever
the
reason,
it
is
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
one
hand,
in
one
case,
the
unreasonableness
depends
on
a
finding
of
fact
not
made
by
the
jury.
but
in
the
federal
system,
it
does
not
require
that
finding
by
a
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
question,
may
i
ask...
on
that
subject,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
have
you
read
the
brief
filed
by
the
national
association...
the
amicus
brief
by
the
national
association
of
defense
lawyers,
which
has
a
long
discussion
of
the
practical
consequences
in
other
states
and
in
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
i
find,
to
be
honest
to
you,
rather
persuasive
on
the
fact
it's
not
such
a
big
deal
as
we
thought
it
might
be.
and
i'd
like
you
to
have
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
whether
there's
something
in
that
brief
that
is
not
accurate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
that
if
the
impact
in
a
four
day
trial
would
normally
be
an
extra
hour
for
the
jury,
that
that's
about
the
burden
on
the
system.
and
of
course,
90
some
percent
of
your
cases
are
pleaded
out
by
guilty,
so
it's
not
the
major
thing
that
we
originally
thought
it
might
be.
do
you
think,
just
across
the
board,
are
they
fairly
accurate
in
their
description
of
what
happens
in
other
states
as
far
as
you're
advised?
