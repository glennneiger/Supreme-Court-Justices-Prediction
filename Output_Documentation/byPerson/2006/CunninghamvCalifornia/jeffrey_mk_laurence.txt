mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
lesson
from
booker,
from
the
real
portion
of
booker,
is
that
not
every
constraint
that's
placed
on
a
trial
court's
discretion
in
selecting
a
term
within
a
range
that
requires
fact-finding
invokes
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
of
a
jury
trial.
a
reasonableness
constraint
that
requires
the
court
to
consider
all
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant
and
select
a
reasonable
sentence
in
relation
to
those
facts
and
those
factors
does
not
invoke
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right.
california
has
consistently
construed
its
system
as
placing
nothing
more
than
a
reasonableness
constraint
on
the
trial
court's
discretion
in
selecting
among
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--yes,
your
honor,
but
that's
the
same
constraint
that
this
court
found
not
above
the
constitution
in
booker.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
that
because
we're
not
talking
about
a
middle
range.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
an
end
point.
if
i
can
use
the
booker
example,
where
you
have
a
term
of
10
years
to
life,
the
court
can
certainly
make
a
selection
within
a
reasonable
range.
at
some
point,
as
the
court
increases
its
sentence
beyond
a
certain
point,
it
will
become
unreasonable.
we
don't
need
to
identify
specifically
what
that
point
is,
the
guideline
range
or
something
close
to
it.
but
when
you
get
to
the
end
point,
if
there's
no
justification
offered
whatsoever
for
a
life
term--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--that's
only
correct
because
california
has
a
discrete
three-term
sentence.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
it
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
central
point
of
both
booker
and
california
is
that
that
upper
term
is
being
reversed
not
because
it's
unauthorized,
but
because
it's
unreasonable.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
your
honor,
if
a
federal
judge
wished
to
impose
a
life
term,
there
would
have
to
be
something
to
justify
it,
or
it
would
be
reversed
on
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
i
would
say
you
are
wrong,
your
honor,
simply
because
california
has
construed
its
sentencing
law
in
1170(b)
as
imposing
nothing
more
than
a
reasonableness--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree,
because
the
upper
term,
the
statutory
maximum
in
booker
would
also
be
necessarily
unreasonable
if
there
was
no
justification
offered
by
the
trial
court--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--i
have
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
what
the
ruling
in
booker
was,
the
court's
discretion
has
to
be
exercised
in
relation
to
the
policy
considerations
set
out
in
3553(a),
which
are
the
same
policy
considerations
that
the
court
must
look
at,
very
similar
in
california,
that
there
are...
the
court
doesn't
have
unbridled
discretion,
select
any
term
based
on
whim,
based
on
whatever
it
feels
would
be...
whatever
he
decides
to
do
on
tuesday.
the
court
has
to
do
it
with
regard
to
the
policy
considerations
that
are
inherent
in
what
the
guidelines
decisions
were,
and
what
the
legislature
established
should
be
appropriate
sentencing
considerations.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
the
systems
converge
at
the
end
point.
and
that
is,
under
the
federal
system,
going
to
that
right
end
point
would
be
unreasonable
in
every
circumstance
if
there's
no
justification
offered,
other
than
he
committed
the
offense.
in
california,
because
we
have
three
discrete
terms
rather
than
a
spectrum,
you
have
the
same
effect
when
you
get
to
the
end
point.
it
would
be
unjustified...
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
sentence
if
there's
no
justification
offered.
but
the
fact
that
california
has
three
points
rather
than
a
range
shouldn't
be
constitutionally
determinative.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
it
can't
be
an
element.
and
that...
obviously,
there
could
be
a
circumstance
where
some
special
findings
were
made,
in
which
case
that
might
be
beyond
the
elements.
but
it
can't
be
an
element
simply
because
you
shouldn't
be
double
counting
what's
already
established.
the
range
is
set
by
the
elements
of
the
offense,
that
all
three
terms
are
available
from
the
jury
verdict
based
on
those
elements.
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
selection
within
that
range,
it
would
have
to
be
more
than
simply
the
defendant
committed
the
offense.
and
that's
the
same
with
the
federal
guidelines.
simply
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
and
i
would
refer
you
to
rule
4.410
in
our
appendix,
page
2
and
3,
that
the
general
policy
considerations
that
over...
that
overlay
our
sentencing
guidelines
or
our
sentencing
system,
include
deterrence
for
this
defendant
and
deterring
others
from
committing
the
same
crime,
that
you
can
just
look
to
the...
what
is
happening
in
this
particular
neighborhood,
as
the
examples
brought
out.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor,
deterrence
is
a
basis
for
going
to
the
third
tier.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
that's
part
of
the
rules
of
court
under
4.410.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
that
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--page
2
and
3.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
considered
an
aggravating
factor,
to
use
deterrence
for
this
particular
case--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--it's
in
our
appendix,
page...
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
i'm
sorry,
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
2
and
3.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
your
honor,
that's
to
exceed
the
base
range,
to
go
beyond
the
three
terms.
if
you
want
to
impose
an
enhancement
for
gun
use,
or
for
an
enhancement
such
as
in
apprendi,
not
for
selecting
a
term
within
the
base
range.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
rules
of
court
are
viewed
as
a
whole
with
4.408,
which
talks
about
anything
in
addition
to...
that
the
rules
of...
the
examples
set
out
are
not
exclusive
and
not
determinant,
that
anything
can
be
a
consideration.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
example
that
was
given
was
in
relation
to
the
community
that
was
experiencing
some
uptick
in
crime.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
the
importance
of
our
position,
the
central
thrust
of
our
position
is
that
the
reasonableness
constraint,
the
constraint
imposed
under
1170(b)
has
been
interpreted
as
a
reasonableness
constraint.
it
doesn't
matter
if
factors
are
required--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
let
me
explain
it
this
way,
your
honor,
that
it
doesn't
matter
from
our
perspective
whether
or
not
there
is
a
factor
required
in
order
to
say
that
something
is...
that
the
end
point
is
reasonable,
or
if
you
are
taking
deterrence
into
account,
that
that's
not...
it's
not
necessary
for
our
argument
because
our
position
is
that
even
if
a
factor
is
required--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
would
refer
back
to
black
at
1255,
which
is
the
important
part.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
no,
your
honor,
but
california
has
construed
1170(b)
as
not
requiring
a
fact-finding
to
move
from
the
middle
term
to
the
upper
term.
it's
simply
saying
that
when
the
court
selects
between
the
three,
the
decision
must
be
reasonable.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
my
answer
would
have
to
be
that
in
relation
to
the
hypothetical
given,
i
was
answering
it
because...
with
regards
to
the
circumstances
of
the
community
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
in.
if
we
take
that
away--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--yes,
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
uh-huh.
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
have
not
been
suggesting
that
that
single
factor
is
what
makes
california's
law
constitutional.
what
makes
california's
law
constitutional
is
the
fact
that
the
constraint
imposed
on
the
court's
discretion
in
selecting
terms
is
a
reasonableness
requirement,
just
like
booker.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
your
honor,
let
me
take
a
step
back
then
and
say
that,
even
with
the
requirement
that
there
be
some
factor,
putting
aside
deterrence
as
a
possibility,
california's
system
as
structured,
which
only
requires
a
reasonableness
constraint,
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
and
the
reason
being
because
all
it's
saying
is
that
if
you're
going
to
the
absolute
maximum,
the
farthest
point
on
the
spectrum
available,
if
there's
no
justification
offered,
it
will
be
reversed
as
unreasonable,
not
as
unavailable.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
let's
just
take
it
a
step
back
and
say
that
what
we're
talking
about
is...
even
if
there
are
circumstances
that
are
required,
even
if
there
are
some
justifications
that
the
court
must
find
aggravating
factors,
still
the
only
constraint
is
reasonableness.
and
let
me
quote
from
what
black
said
about
1170(b),
how
it's
been
construed,
not
from
the
facial
language,
but
how
it's
been
construed.
and
what
black
says
is
on
page
1255
that:
"although
subdivision
(b)
is
worded
in
mandatory
language,
the
requirement
that
an
aggravating
factor
exist
is
merely
a
requirement
that
the
decision
to
impose
the
upper
term
be
reasonable.
"
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
one
thing
that
seems
to
be
giving
you
some
difficulty
is
the
fact
that
california
didn't
explicitly
say
in
black,
we
are
now
officially
bookerizing
our
system.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
california
had
already
implicitly
construed
the
system
as
making
all
three
terms
legally
available
based
on
the
jury
verdict
alone,
and
had
simply
used
a
reasonableness
requirement.
and
that
goes
back
to
hernandez,
back
in
1988,
when
california
essentially
anticipated
apprendi,
and
distinguished
between
making
enhancements
available
based
on
the
jury
verdict
on
the
elements
alone,
versus
the
three,
the
three
components
of
the
triad
scheme.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
and
i...
whether
or
not
the
objectives
of
sentencing
are
involved
is
not
the
critical
point
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
system.
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
what
is
important
is
that,
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
requirement
is
essentially
the
same
as
what's
involved
in
making
discretionary
findings
within
a
range
in
the
federal
system.
and
we're
talking
about
the
findings
within
a
range.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes.
reasonableness
is
the
touchstone
of
the
constraint
imposed
upon
the
trial
courts
in
selecting
among
the
three
terms,
and
that
would
be
a
perfectly--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
reasonableness
has
to
be
tied
to--
the
policy
considerations
that
underlie
the--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
the
california--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--i
would
say
probably
a
rough
guess
would
be
around
10
percent.
that's...
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
well,
your
honor,
it
would
certainly
be
a
big
deal
to
california.
but
more
importantly,
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
a
reasonableness
constraint
reinvokes
the
sixth
amendment,
you
would
be
basically
throwing
into
doubt
the
way
booker
has
reformed
the
federal
system
as
well,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
--as
far
as
the
other
states
go,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
the
impact
on
california
would
be
a
requirement
of
a
secondary
trial
after
the
main
trial.
but
it
would
also
impose
a
burden
of
trying
to
identify
whatever
aggravating
circumstances
or
whatever
relevant
considerations
have
to
take
place
in
this
particular
case,
which
can
be
a
multitude
of
things.
in
california
law,
essentially
anything
can...
anything
can
justify
an
upper
term
sentence.
it's
only
when
there's
absolutely
nothing,
not
a
scintilla
of
justification,
that
an
upper
term
becomes
unreasonable
and
therefore
reversed.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
it's
my
understanding
that
under...
currently
in
california
about
20
percent
of
the
prison
population
has
an
upper
term.
so
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
there
are
on
a
year-by-year
basis,
or
since
blakely
or
since
apprendi,
but
probably
in
the
thousands,
possibly.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
yes,
your
honor.
and
the...
once
again,
the
important
aspect,
what's...
the
key
aspect
is
whether
or
not
a
term
is
legally
available,
and
whether
or
not
there's
a
constraint
that's
imposed
that
takes
away
that
legal
availability
as
a
threshold
matter,
rather
than
a
reasonableness
review
requirement.
california
has
consistently
construed
1170(b)
as
imposing
a
reasonableness
requirement.
this
court
in
booker
said
that
a
reasonableness
requirement
does
not
limit
the
availability
of
those
upper
terms.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
jeffrey
m.k.
laurence
once
again,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
critical
component
of
why
this
system
is
constitutional.
and
that's
not
what
we
are
advancing
in
our
briefs.
it's
not
the
position
that
i'm
arguing
here,
that
that
is
what
would
save
california's
system.
what
saves
california's
system
is
that
the
only
constraint
imposed
is
a
reasonableness
constraint,
and
that
reasonableness
constraint,
1170(b),
has
been
interpreted
over
time
as
simply
imposing
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
on
the
court,
and
that
has
been
applied
to
all
three
terms.
the
middle
term
is
also
reviewed
for
an
abuse
of
discretion,
as
is
the
lower
term.
and
what
is
important
to
note
is,
even
though
the
middle
term...
the
only
reason
the
middle
term
has
been
given
the
label
"presumptive"
is
because
the
court
doesn't
have
to
expressly
articulate
its
reasons
for
selecting
it.
but
it
still
has
to
do
a
balancing
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what's
reasonable,
including
the
middle
term.
