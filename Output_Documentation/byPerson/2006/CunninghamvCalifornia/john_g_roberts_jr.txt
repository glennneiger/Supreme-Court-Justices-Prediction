chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first--
in
05-6551,
cunningham
versus
california.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
thing
that
concerns
me
about
your
case
is
that
california's
system
looks
a
lot
like
the
federal
system
after
booker.
we
haven't
addressed
the
issue
or
had
a
case
involving
review
of
reasonableness
for
upward
departure.
but
at
least
as
the
circuits
have
said
it,
in
a
federal
case,
the
district
judge
imposes
a
maximum,
doesn't
give
any
reason
for
departing
from
what
the
guidelines
might
suggest
is
a
reasonable
middle
ground,
he
may
be...
i
think
in
most
circuits,
that
would
be
reversed.
same
here.
if
a
california
judge
imposes
the
upper
tier
but
doesn't
make
any
findings,
that's
going
to
be
reversed.
but
if
a
federal
judge
gives
a
statement
of
his
reasons,
you
know,
a
vulnerable
victim,
or
an
offender
likely
to
offend
again,
whatever,
under
most
circuit
law,
that's
going
to
be
upheld.
here,
if
the
california
judge
does
that,
that's
going
to
be
still
struck
down
under
your
view.
you
talked
about
blakely
and
apprendi.
but
how
does
this
system
look
to
you
under
booker?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
california,
they're
advisory
anyway.
i
mean,
even
if
the
judge
makes
the
necessary
finding
to
get
up
into
the
higher
tier,
he
doesn't
have
to
impose
the
higher
sentence,
he
can
impose
the
lower
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
if
he
makes
a
finding
that
justifies
going
up
to
the
higher
term,
16
years
in
this
case,
he
doesn't
have
to
impose
that
higher
term,
he
can
go
back
to
the
middle
term.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
only
part
of
the
california
system
that
creates
a
problem
is
this...
the
one
sentence
in
the
statute
that
says
the
judge
shall
impose
the
middle
term
unless
he
makes
a
finding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
the
great
benefit
for
criminal
defendants
in
california
will
be
that
judges
can
now
depart
without
making
a
particular
finding,
they
can
increase
the
sentence
even
though
they
do
not
find
an
aggravator
within
the
limits
of
the
california
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
the
decision
in
black
suggest
the
supreme
court
thinks
that
would
be
the
result?
the
california
supreme
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that...
it
looked
to
me
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
in
black.
i
mean,
in
a
way,
it
is
kind
of
the...
the
black
opinion,
the
day
after,
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
you,
and
the
california
supreme
court
issued
a
decision
looking
a
lot
like
its
decision
in
black,
that
would
be
perfectly
valid.
in
other
words,
saying
that
judges
can
depart
within
this
whole...
just
like
booker,
they
can
depart
within
this
whole
range,
and
we're
going
to
review
their
determinations
for
reasonableness.
they
don't
have
to
impose
the
middle
sentence,
they
can
impose
a
higher
sentence,
and
we
will
review
it
for
reasonableness.
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
they
said
was
judges
can
impose
a
sentence
in
either
of
the
three...
any
one
of
the
three
tiers,
and
we
are
going
to
review
it
for
reasonableness.
and
if
they
don't
make
findings,
it
is
going
to
be
unreasonable,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
protection
that
criminal
defendants
now
have,
that
they
cannot
be
sentenced
to
a
higher
term
unless
the
judge
makes
particular
findings,
will
then
be
no
longer
applicable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
now
the
defendant
will
have
the
protection
of
his
jury
determining
his
guilt,
will
not
only
have
to
know
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
of
the
crime,
but
also
know
why
he's
likely
to
re-offend
in
the
future,
things
like
he
used
a
firearm,
all
the
bad
things
that
will
increase
his
sentence
and
might
affect
how
the
jury
views
the
issue
of
guilt
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
are
there
a
half
a
dozen
jury
trials
in
each...
for
each
of
those
various
aggravating
factors
that
now
have
to
be
tried
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
laurence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
before
you...
could
you
tell
me
where
the
court
rule
you're
talking
about
is
set
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
cases
would
have
to
be
resentenced
if
we
were
to
reverse
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
laurence.
mr.
gold,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
rule
4.410(b)
says
that
the
sentencing
judge
should
be
guided
by
the
criteria
in
these
rules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
misread
california
law
to
agree
with
you,
don't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
i
see
1170(b).
and
i
understand
your
argument,
but
when
i
read
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
in
black,
it
says,
well,
this
is
what
it
means.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
what
it
means,
but
they
get
to
interpret
it,
don't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
