justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
say
that
the
only
basis
for
a
judge
reasonably
imposing
the
higher
term
is
that
the
judge
has
found
a
fact
that
the
jury
didn't
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
say
that?
as
i
read
the
california
opinion,
they
can
go
up
above
the
lower,
the
middle
term
for
any
reason,
but
it
has
to
be
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
that's
hard
to
justify
in
terms
of
california's
statute,
but
we
take
the
california
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
that
statute
as
the
law
of
california.
so
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question
as
you
read
black?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think...
let
me
give
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that
is
your
answer,
my
example
will
be...
i'll
give
you
a
specific
example.
one
example
is
the
question
of
consecutive
versus
concurrent
sentences,
which
may
have
very
little
to
do
with
facts.
a
second
example
might
be
that
a
judge
in
a
particular
community
says
there's
been
an
unbelievable
rash
of
breaking
and
entering.
i
see
how
the
writers
of
this
guideline,
of
the
statute
that
embodies
it,
thought
that
breaking
and
entering
was
x,
occurred
with
x
frequency,
but
we
have
in
this
community
a
sudden
rash
of
crime,
such
that
i
think
the
reasonable
thing
to
do
is
to
increase
the
sentence
as
a
deterrent.
now,
suppose
that's
what
he
writes.
and
is
there
anything
in
california
law,
as
you
understand
black,
that
makes
that
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
statements
make
that
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
when
they
say
mandatory
factor,
they
mean
aggravating
factor,
they
mean
to
exclude
the
kind
of
aggravating
factor
i
just
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
could
he?
could
the
judge
consider
the
fact
that
i
just
mentioned,
that
there's
been
an
extraordinary
rash
of
breaking
and
entering
in
the
vicinity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unenumerated
factors.
so
mine
would
be
an
unenumerated
factor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
he
can
consider
unenumerated
factors...
now,
i
purposely
picked
mine
because
i
take
it
it
is
an
example
of
a
factor
that
apprendi
would
not
require
a
jury
to
find.
it
is
a
factor
about
the
community.
it
is
not
a
factor
about
this
defendant.
it
is
not
a
factor
about
the
manner
in
which
this
defendant
committed
the
crime.
it
is
not
a
fact
of
that
kind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
were
reasonable,
it
would
be
upheld,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
to
be
quite...
to
expose
my
thinking
on
it,
i
found
it
rather
ambiguous,
pages
1260
and
1261.
is
that
what...
the
first
part
of
that
is...
it
says
what
you
said.
i
have
no
doubt.
it
says
just
what
you
said.
but
then
you
get
over
to
the
part,
the
discussion
of
booker,
and
when
they
start
talking
about
booker,
they
seem
to
say,
seem
to
say,
that
they're
adopting
what
booker
says.
now,
if
they
are
adopting
what
booker
says,
that
means,
and
that's
why
i
used
my
example,
that
i
guess
a
judge
would
have
the
power,
if
it
is
reasonable,
to
just
say
the
guideline,
though
it
says
thus
and
so,
isn't
right
for
my
circumstance.
and
therefore,
i
don't
adopt
it.
and
that
would
be
reviewed
for
reasonableness,
his
decision
not
to
follow
it.
and
similarly,
we
have
cases,
for
example,
where
they're
trying
to
construct
a
sentence
and
they
can't
get
it
right
because
of
the
consecutive/concurrent
nature,
so
he
adds
a
few
things
on,
you
see,
to
the
sentence,
in
order...
and
then
makes
them
concurrent.
or
you
could
have
things
where
it
is
a
very
sophisticated
conspiracy,
and
the
jury
found
the
conspiracy.
it
is
a
characterization
of
a
conspiracy,
it
is
very
sophisticated.
and
i
thought,
well,
maybe
all
three
of
those
are
reasons
for
going
up
in
california.
and
i
read
those
pages,
1260,
1261,
and
my
honest
opinion
is
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
an
aggravating
factor
means
aggravating
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
interesting.
are
there,
in
fact...
what's
your
estimate,
guess,
as
to
how
many
criminal
jury-tried
cases
in
california,
what
percent
have
two
juries?
have
more
than
one
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
what
percentage
would
you
say
they
have
bifurcated
or
several
jury
trials?
i
mean,
more
than
just
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
how
many,
how
many
times
do
they...
let
me
call
it
impaneling
the
jury
twice,
or
two
juries,
or
it
could
be
the
same
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
what
percentage
would
you
guess?
just
make
a
rough...
roughest
conceivable
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
fact.
it
could
be
a
fact.
what
it
says
in
here
is
that
if
the...
they
speak
of
a
circumstance
related
to
the
crime,
or
the
offender.
and
in
a
case
in
which
no
such
aggravating
factor
can
be
found,
the
judge
cannot
impose
the
upper
term.
now,
i
grant
you
there's
some
language
that
i...
it
seems
to
me
on
the
next
few
paragraphs,
seems
to
say
something
a
little
different.
but
that
language,
if
you
just
take
that,
seems
to
say,
unless,
judge,
you
find
a
fact
about
the
situation
that
would
make
it
reasonable
to
go
above
the
middle
range,
you
can't,
under
the
law.
now,
if
that's
what
it
says,
i
have
to
admit,
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
distinguish
from
blakely
and
other
cases
where
i
dissented,
but
the
court's
law
is
what
the
majority
says.
so
that
seems
to
me
almost
like
it,
unless
you
can
tell
me
that
i'm
wrong
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
critical,
and
that's
what
i
didn't
understand
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
appendix
page
3
in
the
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
i
do
here?
because
the
sentence
i
read
to
you
seems
to
say
the
opposite.
but
then,
two
sentences
on,
they
list,
the
federal
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
guidelines,
he
must
consult
the
guidelines.
and
after
they
say,
an
aggravating
california...
it
says
the
discretion
available...
the...
in
california
law,
that
may
include
any
fact
that
the
judge
reasonably
determines
to
be
relevant.
the
determinate
sentencing
law,
about
an
upper
term,
is
comparable
to
booker's
requirement
that
a
federal
judge's
sentencing
decision
not
be
unreasonable.
well,
i
assumed
until
this
minute
that
the
first
statement
trumped
the
second.
but
now
when
i
see
the
court
rule,
certainly
that
court
rule
is
possible,
given
that
to
be
read
as
permitting
them,
particularly
with
the
second
statement,
you
could
read
the
second
statement
as
saying,
yes,
they
can
say
a
particular
instance
or
a
kind
of
sentence
seemingly
mandated
at
the
middle
level
is,
in
this
community,
so
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
punishment
that
i'm
giving
a
higher
one.
to
be
honest,
i
don't
know
what
black
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
we
have...
now,
this
has
clarified
it,
but
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
i
think
if
i
read
the
opinion
the
way
you're
saying,
i
would
say
the
california
court,
which
is
a
good
court,
conscientious,
managing
a
huge
system
of
criminal
law
in
the
state,
probably
bigger
than
the
federal
system,
reads
blakely
and
they
see
that
those
guidelines
in
california
as
previously
understood
were
violated.
and
they're
thinking,
how
do
we
maintain
this
system
as
constitutional.
and
therefore,
they
write
1261,
which
can
be
read
as
saying
we're
bookerizing
it,
and
we
come
as
close
to
booker
as
necessary
to
make
it
constitutional.
now,
that
would
be
an
understandable
judicial
reaction,
and
i
can
read
the
opinion
as
saying
that,
at
which
point
i'm
not
certain
what
we're
supposed
to
say,
because
i
have
no
doubt
that
your
unease
reflects
the
fact
that
prior
to
black,
in
california,
it
would
have
been
pretty
unheard
of
for
a
judge
to
depart
upward
on
grounds
other
than
factual
grounds
related
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
or
offender.
but
i
also
have
no
doubt
that
this
opinion
is
written
to
try
to
save
the
california
system.
all
right,
so
now
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
is
comparable
to
booker.
and
then
in
the
preceding
four
paragraphs,
they
correctly
describe
booker?
