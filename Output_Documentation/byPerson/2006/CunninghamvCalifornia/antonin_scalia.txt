justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
an
erroneous
instruction,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
either
have
to
have
an
erroneous
instruction
or
a
special
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
answer
would
be
that
how
could
it
possibly
be
reasonable
except
for
the
consideration
of
some
additional
fact?
what
makes
it
reasonable
other
than
facts?
atmosphere?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
understand
it.
if
he
does...
tell
me
again,
would
you?
i
thought
your
response
was
going
to
be
what
justice...
who
suggested
it?
[laughter]
somebody
on
that
side
suggested
it.
that
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
there's
a
lot
of
crime
in
the
community
as
an
aggravating
factor
doesn't
make
any
sense.
aggravating
factor
means
something
that
makes
the
crime
that
this
person
committed
worse,
not
the
need
for
punishment
greater,
but
makes
the
crime
worse.
now,
if
that
is
not
your
answer,
what
is
the
answer
that
you
gathered,
from
the
left
of
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that
a
sentence
within
the
guideline
range
is
reasonable
is
not
to
say
that
a
sentence
outside
the
guideline
range
is
unreasonable.
so
under
the
federal
system,
it
is
perfectly
possible...
unless,
unless
we
hold
otherwise...
for
a
judge
to
give
a
sentence
beyond
the
guideline
range,
and
nonetheless
to
be
affirmed,
because
although
the
guideline
range
is
reasonable,
there
are
other
systems
that
would
be
reasonable,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
they
could
say
the
middle
term
will
always
be
reasonable.
couldn't
they
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so
at
all.
california
says
if
you
go
over
the
middle
range,
it
is
unreasonable,
period,
unless
you
prove
or
you
find
one
of
the
aggravating
factors.
that's
a
constraint.
you
cannot
go
above
the
middle
range.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
not
what
we
found
in
booker.
we
found
in
booker,
or
at
least
the
way
the
lower
federal
courts
have
been
interpreting
booker,
if
you
use
the
guideline
range,
and
you're
within
the
guideline
range,
that
is
automatically
reasonable,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
but
we
haven't
held,
and
i
don't
believe
most
of
the
federal
courts
have
held,
that
if
you
go
beyond
the
guideline
range,
it
is
automatically
unreasonable.
and
that
is
the
case
with
the
california
system,
if
you
go
beyond
the
middle
range,
it
is
automatically
unreasonable
unless
you...
unless
you
find
one
of
the
aggravating
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
justification
under
the
federal
system
could
be,
you
know,
this
is
what
the
sentencing
commission
thought
was
a
reasonable
sentence
for
this
crime.
i
disagree
with
that.
now,
there
are
other
authorities
who
think
that
that's
a
little
too,
you
know,
below
what
it
ought
to
be.
he
can
simply
disagree
with
the
sentencing
guidelines.
or
he
could
point
out
what
justice
breyer
suggests,
well,
the
sentencing
guidelines
may
be
okay
for
some
jurisdictions,
but
in
this
jurisdiction,
we
have
a
special
problem
with
regard
to
this
kind
of
a
crime.
he
can
do
that
and
doesn't
have
to
find
any
special
fact.
he
cannot
do
that
in
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
the
same
in
the
federal
guidelines.
under
the
federal
guidelines,
the
judge
could
say,
you
know,
i
think
this
offense
is
more
serious
than
what
the
sentencing
commission
thought,
and
these
are
my
reasons
for
it.
there
was
a
dissent,
you
know...
the
sentencing
commission's
determinations
are
reasonable,
but
they
are
surely
not
the
only
reasonable
disposition.
and
it
is
open
to
a
federal
district
judge
to
say,
well,
that's
what
they
thought,
and
i
took
it
into
account,
and
i
seriously
considered
it,
and
i
think
they
are
wrong
on
this,
i
think
this
is
more
serious.
and
that
could
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
determination.
that
couldn't
be
done
in
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
true.
you
certainly
didn't
argue
that
way
in
your
papers
up
to
now.
i
thought
that
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
some
aggravating
factor,
not
simply,
i
think
deterrence
is
more
than
what
the
statute
says,
or
deterrence
requires
more
than
what
the
statute
says.
is
that
really
your
position,
that
if
a
judge
thinks
deterrence
requires
more
than
the
middle
range,
for
that
reason
alone,
he
can
say
i
ignore
the
middle
range?
justice
antonin
scalia
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
in
your
brief,
which
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
comport
with
what
you
are
saying
here,
for
a
judge
to
exceed
the
base
range,
for
example,
by
applying
enhancement
or
an
alternative
sentencing
scheme,
the
predicate
fact
for
the
enhancement
or
alternative
scheme
must
be
pleaded
and
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there's
no
indication
there
that
the
judge
could
just
say,
i
think
more
deterrence
is
necessary
and
therefore,
i'm
going
to
exceed
the
base
range.
that's
just
totally
incompatible
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
have
to
be
an
aggravating
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
talk
about
the
need
for
more
deterrence
as
an
aggravating
factor,
that's
not
an
aggravating
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
an
aggravating
factor.
it's
a
basis
for
imposing
a
harsher
sentence,
but
it
doesn't
aggravate
this
crime
as
opposed
to
the
same
crime
committed
by
other
individuals.
it's
not
an
aggravating
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
legislature
would
be
astounded
to
think
that
this
is
what
they
have
wrought.
they
obviously
intended
to
establish
a
scheme
in
which
the
judge
would
apply
the
middle
range,
not
using
his
own
perception
as
to
whether
more
punishment
is
justified
or
not,
unless
there's
some
circumstances
about
this
crime
that
make
this
person
more
guilty,
and
that's
what
you
usually
mean
by
aggravating
circumstances,
not
the
fact
that
you
believe
the
crime
should
bear...
in
general,
should
bear,
a
higher
penalty.
i
think
they
would
be
astounded
to
find
that
this
is
what
they
have
created.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
want
us
to
hold
that,
you
know,
that
we
uphold
the
system
here
in
an
opinion
that
says
what
california's
sentencing
judges
may
do
under
california
law,
as
you've
described
it
to
us,
is
that
they...
they
may
exceed
the
middle
range
whenever
they
think
that
that
is
a
better
result,
whenever
they
think
that
that's
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
california
would
be
happy
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
including
reasonable
disagreement
with
the
level
of
severity
that
the
legislature
has
provided
in
the
middle
term.
i
mean,
other
legislatures
may
have
provided
higher
severity
and
the
judge
says,
i
simply
disagree
with
the
california
legislature.
and
it's
a
reasonable
disagreement,
because
some
other
legislature
might
have
done
what
i
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
reasonable?
why
isn't
it
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
ties
it
to
that.
he
says,
i
just
disagree
with
the
california
legislature
as
to
whether
this
is
enough
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
committing
this
kind
of
a
crime.
and
look...
and
he
cites
another
state
which
provides
a
much
higher
sentence
for
the
same
crime.
can
that
possibly
be
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
don't
mean
reasonableness.
you
mean
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
california
trial
judge
has
gone
beyond
the
middle
range
not
on
the
basis
of
a
fact
that
that
judge
has
found,
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
some
general
policy
he
thinks
that
the
punishment
should
be
greater,
something
along
the
lines
of
what
justice
breyer
suggested?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
either,
and
i
would
be
astounded
if
any
trial
judge
would
read
these
statutes
and
court
rules
that
way.
