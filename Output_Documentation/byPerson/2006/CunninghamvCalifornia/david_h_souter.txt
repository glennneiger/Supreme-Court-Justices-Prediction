david
h.
souter
would
it
always,
then,
be
surplusage
in
the
indictment
when
a
fact
is
charged
and
subsequently
found
by
a
jury,
is
it
always
a
surplus
fact?
because
otherwise...
i
mean,
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
otherwise,
one
assumes
it
would
be
a
way
of
stating
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
as
i
understand
it,
under
california
law,
the
element
of
the
offense
couldn't
satisfy
the
additional
fact
necessary
to
jump
up
to
the
higher
range.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
in
this
case,
the
indictment
had
charged...
had
claimed
that
the
defendant
was
the
father
of
the
victim,
would
that
have
satisfied
at
least
the
fact-finding
for
the
aggravator
of
being
in
a
position
of
trust?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
depends
on
the
instructions.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
instructions
said,
you
know,
you've
got
to
find
all
of
the
things
that
are
set
out
in
the
information,
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict,
then
we
would
have
found...
and
that
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
an
additional
fact
on
an
element.
justice
david
h.
souter
only
in
the
sense
that
it
would
require
the
state
to
prove
more
than
it
had
to
prove
for
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
draw...
as
i
understand
it,
your
basic
answer
to
justice
breyer
is,
it
may
well
be
that
the
situation
in
the
community
may
justify
a
judge
in
going
to
the...
to
the
high
end
of
the
range
that
is
possible,
but
that
is
not
a
factor
that
determines
what
range
is
possible.
and
the
fact
that
determines
what
range
is
possible
is
an
aggravating
fact,
and
in
that
respect,
it
is
different
from
the
federal
system.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--even
though
there
is
the
possibility
that
something
above
the
middle
term
would
also
be
reasonable
without
necessarily
finding
a
discrete
fact
beyond
the
indictment
to
justify
it.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if...
as
i
understand
it,
it
has
construed
it
by
saying
that
if
you
go
above
the
middle
term
without
a
discrete
finding
of
fact
beyond
what
has
to
be
proven
to
the
jury,
it
is
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
that
unreasonableness
as
a
matter
of
law
feature
is
what
distinguishes
it
from
the
federal
system
post
booker.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
must
make
a
discrete
finding
of
fact
in
order
to
do
it.
we
come
back
to
justice
scalia's
hypo
a
moment
ago.
he
can
go,
you
know,
in
theory,
under
booker,
he
can
go
above
the
guideline
range
consistent
with
policy
positions
that
may
not
be
precise,
without
necessarily
making
discrete
findings
of
fact.
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
judge
it
in
each
individual
case,
but
the
possibility
is
there.
and
under
the
california
system,
the
possibility
is
not
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
to
us
that
under
the
california
system,
if
a
california
judge
went
through
exactly
the
thought
process
that
justice
scalia
just
outlined
and
put
that
down
on
paper,
without
finding
any
discrete
fact
beyond
the
elements
the
jury
found,
that
he
could
go
to
the
third
tier?
i
really
think
deterrence
requires
the
third
tier,
not
the
middle
tier?
can
a
california
judge
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
even
for
selecting
a
term
within
the
base
range,
i'm
going
to
read
now
from
rule
4.20.
part
(b)
says,
"circumstances
in
aggravation
and
mitigation
shall
be
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
"
that's
not
the
way
we
refer
to
judges'
reasoning
about
policy.
that's
the
way
we
refer
to
proof
of
fact.
and
i
don't
see
how
under
subsection
(b)
your
answer
to
me
can
be
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
can
be
a
reasonableness
constraint
and
also
be
a
reasonableness
restraint
that
requires
a
finding
of
discrete
facts
for
reasonableness.
the
two
are
not
exclusive.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
rule
seems
to
conflate...
seems
very
clearly
to
conflate
the
finding
of
a
discrete
fact.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
to
consider
the
rule
in
responding
to
the
ambiguity
that
justice
breyer
referred
to
a
moment
ago.
the
ambiguity
has
got
to
be
read
in
light
of
subsection
(b),
and
subsection
(b)
seems
to
answer
the
ambiguity
by
saying
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
means
a
fact
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
do
you
think
under
subsection
(b)
of
rule
4.420,
if
a
judge
said,
i
just
think
the
policy
of
deterrence
requires
something
heavier,
you
think
that
statement
by
the
judge
would
satisfy
the
requirement
that
circumstances
in
aggravation
shall
be
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
hold
your
position
consistently
with
the
state
rule
of
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
black
repealing
the
rule
of
court?
i
mean,
black...
if
we
refer
back
to
black,
we
get
the
ambiguity
that
justice
breyer
has
raised.
in
order
to
solve
the
ambiguity,
we
look
to
the
court
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
the
court
rule,
you
admit
that
a
judge's
policy
consideration,
however
sincerely
held,
could
not
satisfy
the
requirement
to
prove
aggravation
by
a
preponderance.
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
issue?
i
mean,
if
california
wants
to
amend
its
rules
or
its
statute,
that's
california's
business.
but
we
can't
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
you
give
a
different
answer
to
my
question?
why
didn't
you
say,
if
it
is
reasonable
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
deterrence
really
requires
something
tougher
than
the
middle
term,
that's
enough?
why
didn't
you
say
that
is
enough
and
(b)
wouldn't
preclude
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's...
the
judge,
the
judge
is
on
the
bench.
he
says,
there's
too
much
crime
in
our
community,
look
at
these
statistics,
i
believe
that
deterrence
requires
something
heavier
than
the
middle
tier.
nothing
unusual
about
this
particular
crime.
i'm
making
a
policy
decision
about
what
the
law
should
require
in
general.
would
that
satisfy
part
(b)
of
4.420?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of,
as
it
puts
it,
establishing
by
a--
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
not
what
i
understood
california
law
to
be
or
your
position
to
be
until
this
moment.
justice
david
h.
souter
reasonably...
that
does
not
answer
the
problem.
