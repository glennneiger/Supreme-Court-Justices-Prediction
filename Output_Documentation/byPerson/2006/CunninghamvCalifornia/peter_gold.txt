mr.
peter
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
procedure
for
imposing
aggravated
sentences
under
california's
determinate
sentencing
law
implicates
the
bright
line
rule
this
court
set
forth
in
blakely
and
apprendi.
any
fact
other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
which
increases
the
penalty
for
a
crime
beyond
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum
must
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
primary
point
of
contention
in
this
case
is
what
constitutes
the
statutory
maximum
under
california's
determinate
sentencing
law.
petitioner
believes
that
it's
the
middle
term,
whereas
respondent
maintains
that
it's
the
upper
term.
in
fact,
this
case
really
boils
down
to
just
one
question.
can
a
judge
in
california
legally
impose
an
upper
term
sentence
based
solely
on
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury's
verdict
or
the
defendant's
admissions.
the
answer
to
this
question
is
no.
california's
determinate
sentencing
law
specifies
three
possible
prison
terms
for
each...
for
each
felony
conviction,
a
lower
term,
a
middle
term,
and
an
upper
term,
although
it
mandates
that
judges
shall
impose
the
middle
term
unless
there
are
factors
of
aggravation
or
mitigation.
california
case
law
confirms
that
judges
must
impose
the
middle
term
where
there
are
no
aggravating
factors,
and
even
the
state
appears
to
concede
the
point.
because
the
middle
term
is
the
greatest
punishment
a
judge
can
impose
based
solely
on
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury's
verdict,
it,
and
not
the
upper
term,
constitutes
the
statutory
maximum
for--
mr.
peter
gold
--your
honor,
justice
stevens,
to
the
extent
that
a
fact
is
found
by
the
jury
which
can
be
used
as
an
aggravating
factor,
but
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
or
found
by
the
jury
as
an
enhancement,
that
could
be
used
to
impose
an
upper
term
sentence.
yes.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
typically
under
california
law,
in
the
information,
they
allege
the
crime,
and
on
occasion,
some
of
the
elements.
but
typically
not
all
of
the
elements.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
information
would
have
alleged
that
does
not
mean
that
the
jury
would
have
found
that
fact,
because
just
because...
what
is
alleged
in
the
indictment
or
in
the
information--
mr.
peter
gold
--yes.
mr.
peter
gold
i
believe
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
peter
gold
yes.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
justice
souter,
and
i
agree
that
it
would
be
no
different
than
submitting
aggravating
factors
as
a
separate
allegation
to
the
jury
as
a
separate
instruction.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
your
honor,
this
system
really
is...
this
is
just
like...
this
case
is
just
like
blakely.
what
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
against
black
found,
they
used
references
to
reasonableness
as
a
label
and
a
characterization
to
avoid
the
bright
line
rule
of
blakely
and
apprendi.
instead
they
tried
to
fit
the
determinate
sentencing
law
within
the
federal
system
this
court
found
constitutional
in
booker.
but
the
california
supreme
court
seriously
misread
booker.
in
booker,
in
the
remedial
portion
of
that
decision,
this
court
found
the
federal
system
to
be
constitutional
by
rendering
the
guidelines...
the
mandatory
guidelines
to
be
advisory.
now--
mr.
peter
gold
--mr.
chief
justice,
no.
he
has
to
impose
the
middle
term.
he
can't
deviate--
mr.
peter
gold
--no,
no,
you
are
absolutely
right.
he
has
discretion
not
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
gold
yes.
mr.
peter
gold
your
honor,
what
this...
what
the
california
supreme
court
did,
in
this--
mr.
peter
gold
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
black
has
made
no
change
whatsoever
to
the
mandatory
nature
of
california's
determinate
sentencing
law,
and
it
has
always
operated
in
a
mandatory
way.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gold
i
believe
that
the
statements
in
black--
mr.
peter
gold
--your
honor,
in
black,
the
california
supreme
court
repeatedly
stated
that
the
way
the
system
works
in
california
is
that
it
is
a
mandatory
system.
so
as
an
example,
at
35
cal.
4th
1254,
the
court
stated,
"the
court
cannot
impose
the
upper
term
unless
there
is
at
least
one
aggravating
factor.
"
at
1260,
the
court
said,
"in
a
case
in
which
no
aggravating
factor
can
be
found,
the
judge
cannot
impose
the
upper
term.
"
there
are
a
number
of
statements
throughout
the
black
opinion
that
indicate
the
system
has
never
changed
from
a
mandatory
one
to
an
advisory
one,
so
that
reasonableness
is
not
the
issue.
whether
the
system
is
mandatory
or
advisory--
mr.
peter
gold
--well,
a
judge
can
consider
those
aggravating
factors.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
gold
--well,
under
california's
law,
they
have...
in
addition
to
factors
relating
to
the
crime
and
factors
relating
to
the
defendant,
the
judge
can
consider
unenumerated
factors.
mr.
peter
gold
yes.
mr.
peter
gold
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
sort
of
factor
would
be
upheld
as
a--
mr.
peter
gold
--if
it
was
found
to
be
a
decision
that
was
reasonably
related
to
the
crime...
i'm
sorry,
to
the
decision
being
made
by
the
judge,
then
yes,
it
would
be
upheld
as
a
valid
aggravating
factor.
but
i
believe
that
it
would
still
need
to
be
then,
if
it
would
be
considered
a
valid
aggravating
factor,
then
it
would
need
to
be
tried
by
the
jury.
mr.
peter
gold
your
honor,
under
california
law,
i'm
not
saying
that
that
would
be
upheld
as
a
valid
reason.
i'm
just--
mr.
peter
gold
--no,
justice
stevens,
there
is
not.
mr.
peter
gold
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
souter.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
with
all
due
respect
to
justice
breyer,
i
believe
that
that
probably
would
not
be
an
aggravating
factor
that
would
be
upheld
under
california
law.
i
was
just
trying
to
make
the
distinction
between
whether
an
aggravating
factor,
no
matter
what
it
is,
whether
it
is
considered
reasonable,
whether
that's
enough
to
get
the
judge
to
go
beyond
the
statutory
maximum.
but--
mr.
peter
gold
--the
position
as
far
as
what
black
is
saying?
mr.
peter
gold
yes.
i
think
black...
what
black
is
saying
is
that
an
aggravating
factor
needs
to
be
reasonable,
but
i
was
trying
to
make
the
distinction--
mr.
peter
gold
--certainly
if
the
aggravating
factor
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
then
it
won't
be
considered
reasonable
and
the
imposition
of
a
upper
term
won't
be
considered
reasonable.
but--
mr.
peter
gold
--your
honor,
if
you're
describing
the
federal
system
or
just
a
hypothetical
system,
my
understanding
in
a
indeterminate
type
of
system,
a
judge
can
impose
whatever
sentence
he
wants.
and
whether
or
not
in
a
particular
system,
that
will
be
reviewed
for
reasonableness
is
a
separate
question
as
to
what
he--
mr.
peter
gold
--yes,
your
honor.
but
what...
in
booker,
what
made
the
federal
system
constitutional
was
not
the
engraftment
of
the
reasonableness
review.
it
was
rendering
the
mandatory
guidelines
advisory.
and
that's
the
aspect
of
california's
supreme
court
black
decision
that
they've
misread
the
booker
decision.
mr.
peter
gold
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
it's
the
mandatory
nature
in
california
of
the
middle
term.
the
judge
cannot
exceed
the
middle
term
unless
he
finds
at
least
one
aggravating
factor.
and
my
understanding
in
the
federal
system
is
that
the
judge
can
exceed
the...
can
exceed
these
guideline
ranges
and
that
they're
just
advisory.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
your...
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
we
are
going
to
say
that
any
sentence
outside
this
guideline
range
is
going
to
be
unreasonable
and
necessarily
require
reversal
is
going
to
be
no
different
than
the
mandatory
guideline
system
this
court
struck
down
in
booker
itself.
mr.
peter
gold
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
peter
gold
but
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
not
clear
that
that
would
be
the
result
in
california.
the
legislature
could
very
well--
mr.
peter
gold
--i'm
not
sure
that
they
think
that
that
would
be
the
result.
they
certainly
did
not
make
an
attempt
to
reform
or
rewrite
the
statute
so
that
it
was
now
an
advisory
system.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
and
that
may
very
well
be
the
case,
but
that's
not
what
the
california
supreme
court
did
in
black.
they
made
no
attempt.
what
they
did
was
described
the
determinate
sentencing
law
as
it
has
always
operated.
and
at
no
time
did
they
purport
to
change
the
law
in
california,
including
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
determinate
sentencing
law.
mr.
peter
gold
yes,
but
once
again,
the
reasonableness
aspect
is
not
what
makes
the
system
constitutional.
it
is
the
mandatory
versus
advisory
aspect.
and
again,
that's
what
made
the
federal
system
constitutional
based
on
this
court's
booker
decision.
it
wasn't
this
engraftment
of
reason...
reviewing
these
sentences
for
reasonableness.
mr.
peter
gold
well,
your
honor,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
california
supreme
court
was
trying
to
fit
the
determinate
sentencing
law
within
the
constitutionality
of
this
court's
booker
system.
but
as
far
as
1261,
i'm
looking...
every
single
time
they
talk
about
booker
or
reasonableness,
they
also
make
sure
to
give
the...
to
make
sure
that
they
make
clear
that
the
way
the
sentence...
the
system
works
is
that
there's
still
this
requirement
of
finding
an
aggravating
factor.
mr.
peter
gold
aggravating
fact,
uh...
yes.
mr.
peter
gold
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
could...
the
court
or
the
legislature
could
change
section
1170(b)
to
read
something
like:
"a
judge
may
impose"
instead
of
"shall
impose"
the
middle
term.
and
that
would
be
valid
to
the
extent
that
what
they
mean
by
"may"
is
they
can
now
impose
the
middle
term
based
just
on
the
facts
found
by
the
jury.
mr.
peter
gold
they
could,
and
in
effect,
they
do
say
that--
mr.
peter
gold
--yes.
there
are--
mr.
peter
gold
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
and
i--
mr.
peter
gold
--yes,
justice
stevens.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
make,
that
that
is
a
very
likely
outcome,
given
what
the
majority
of
other
states
have
done.
and
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
a--
mr.
peter
gold
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
because
for
those
type
of
prejudicial
factors,
california
is
well-positioned
to
handle
those,
because
they
do
so
anyway
in
bifurcated
proceedings.
there
are
often
enhancement
allegations
that
relate
to
recidivism
or
even
gang
allegations,
anything
that's
prejudicial
are
handled
at
a
separate
proceeding
after
trial.
mr.
peter
gold
no,
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
basically
california
does
that
anyway
now.
most
of
the
factors
that
relate
to
the
defendant
have
to
do
with
recidivism.
and
those
are
the
same
kind
of
factors
that
are
alleged
in
the
information,
and
are
tried
in
a
bifurcated
proceeding
to
the
jury,
or
are
waived
and
then
the
trial
court
will
consider
them.
mr.
peter
gold
they
don't
have
more
than
one
jury.
they
are
tried
to
the
same
jury,
but
they
are
tried
after
the--
mr.
peter
gold
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
there
are
lots
of
cases
where
they're
tried
to
a
court.
the
defendant
will
waive
them
if
they're
based
on
recidivism.
mr.
peter
gold
the
same--
mr.
peter
gold
--completely
anecdotally,
i
would
say
20
percent.
i...
if...
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
respond
to
three
items.
the
first
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
were
asking
about
what
would
be
the
effect
in
california
on
those
that
have
already
been
sentenced.
the
only
information
i
have
was
what
was
contained
in
black,
that
only
13
to
17
percent
of
cases
are
sentenced
in
the
upper
range.
but
what
the
court
should
also
consider
is
that
most...
in
most
cases,
the
difference
between
the
middle
term
and
upper
term
is
really
only
a
year.
in
this
case,
it
is
four
years,
which
is
somewhat
unusual.
so
in
those
cases,
a
lot
of
the
people
will
have
already
served
their
prison
sentences
by
the
time
that
they
would
be
able
to
benefit
from
any
result
in
this
case.
i
also
wanted
to
echo
what
justice
kennedy,
i
believe,
was
saying.
california
rules
of
court,
rule--
4.410
is
just
general
objectives
of
sentencing.
these
are
not
aggravating
factors.
you
can't
take
into
account
achieving
uniformity
of
sentencing,
securing
restitution
for
the
victims,
these
aren't
aggravating
factors
that
the
judge
considers.
mr.
peter
gold
in
sentencing,
but
i
don't
believe
as
far
as
finding
them
as
aggravating
factors,
these
are
not
facts
that
judges
in
california
use
to
impose
upper-term
sentences.
mr.
peter
gold
your
honor,
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i've
never
seen
a
judge
take
these
into
account
as
an
aggravating
factor.
and
i
would
be
surprised,
under
the
case
law,
if
these
have
been
ever
upheld
as
valid
aggravating
factors.
mr.
peter
gold
certainly,
yes.
certainly,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
gold
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
gold
they
do
get
to
interpret
how
their
statutes
operate,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
they
are
consistent
in
saying
that
this
is
a
mandatory
system.
in
every
one
of
their
quotes,
they
talk
about
either
a
judge
must
impose
the
middle
term
unless
there
are
aggravating
factors,
or
they
talk
about
the
requirement...
i
was
going
to
mention
justice
breyer's
quote
from
black.
and
even
in
that
one,
they
say
because
an
aggravating
factor
under
california
law
may
include
any
factor
that
the
judge
reasonably
deems
to
be
relevant,
and
then
say
the
determinate
sentencing
law's
requirement
that
an
upper-term
sentence
be
imposed
only
if
an
aggravating
factor
exists.
they
always
talk
about
the
requirement
that
this
aggravating
factor
must
exist.
mr.
peter
gold
yes.
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
they
are
trying
to
fit
the
determinate
sentence
law
within
booker,
but
booker
is
about
making...
the
magic
word,
as
it
were,
is
advisory
versus
mandatory,
not
reasonableness.
so
yes,
the
california
system
is
reasonable.
and
that's
what
the
california
supreme
court
is
talking
about--
mr.
peter
gold
--well,
justice
alito,
there
is
discretion
in
our
system.
but
it
is
the
discretion
to
impose
an
upper-term
after
finding
aggravating
factors.
and
i
think
that
in
an
indeterminate
system,
as
you
were
discussing
earlier,
i
think
that
that...
i'm
not
sure.
it
depends
what
the
system
is,
as
far
as
what
the
reasonableness
constraints
are.
