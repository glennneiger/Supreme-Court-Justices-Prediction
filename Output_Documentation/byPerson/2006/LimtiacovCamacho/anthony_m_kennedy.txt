justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
suggesting
that
the
test
is
whether
under
colorable
jurisdiction...
a
hypothetical
case,
suppose
the
statute,
federal
statute
is
very
clear
that
it
applies
in
any
case.
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
we
accept
that
in
the
opinion,
what
was
the
phrase
you
used,
colorable
jurisdiction,
or...
it's
something
i
made
up,
i
suppose...
is
there
some
concept
that
we
can
refer
to
or
some
phrase
that
works
to...
in
order
to
incorporate
your
test
that
you
seem
to
be
suggesting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
waxman,
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
i
don't
understand
what
the
import
of
this
order
on
page
51
is.
i
have
it
in
front
of
me.
what
did
that
do?
is
it
anything
different
immediately
after
the
order
entered
than--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
am
i
wrong?
i
thought
that
the
attorney
general
of
guam
did
file
cert
in
some
cases
that
are
pending,
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
waxman,
can
i
ask
you
this,
just
about
guam,
not
about
the
other
territories.
is
there
anything
in
the
organic
act
that
would
prevent
guam
from
changing
the
assessed
percentage
from
35
percent
to
100
or
150?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there's
no,
no
limit
in
the
organic
act
of
any
real
meaning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they're
valuing
it
for
tax
purposes,
so
that
sounds
like
tax
valuation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
just
before
you
go
there,
if
i
were
a
bond
investor,
i
would
much
prefer
issuing
bonds
if
it's
the
lower
value,
if
it's
the
assessed
value.
i'm
just
more
secure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
do
have
a
concrete
appraisal,
but
it's
just
reduced
to
35
percent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
case,
you
should
want
us
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
still
have
the
option,
and
i'm
just
dying
to
ask
the
question
not
having
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
why
did
they
do
this?
why
did
they
have...
was
it
just
to
make
everybody
feel
good
and
they
think
they're
ripping
off
the
government
because
they're
getting
only
a
35
percent
value,
even
though
everybody
knows
they'll
just
raise
the
rate
if
it
changes?
