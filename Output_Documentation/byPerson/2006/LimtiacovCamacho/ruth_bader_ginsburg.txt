mr.
waxman,
going
back
to
what
you
just
said,
isn't
a
third
possibility,
the
most
likely
possibility,
that
this
court
would
simply
hold
the
petition
if
there
were...
if
the
attorney
general
filed
a
cert
petition
here
while
the
ninth
circuit
had
not
yet
disposed
of
the
case,
this
court
could
have
just
held
it
because
the
ninth
circuit
was
likely
soon
to
dispose
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
just
the
case...
you've
made
several
arguments,
but
you
have
a
case
that's
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
not
simply
a
petition
there.
they
have
accepted
it
for
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
the
normal
course
when
you
have
a
district
court
decision,
a
trial
court
decision,
then
you're
on
appeal
and
the
case
is
fully
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
like
the
judgment
is
suspended
until
the
appellate
court
is
done.
so
you
have
no
final
judgment
that
is
properly
taken
anyplace
else
until
that
judgment
is
entered.
i
think
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
you
should
go
on
to
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
that
i
have
a
preliminary
question,
because
we
have
a
new
attorney
general
and
the
question
is
whether
the
new
attorney
general
continues
to
oppose
the
legislature
and
the
governor
on
this
bond
issue.
do...
in
other
words,
do
we
still
have
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
congress
sometimes
withdraws
jurisdictions
from
courts,
but
while
the
case
is
spending
it
isn't
until
the
court
issues
the
order...
there's
no
automatic
dismissal
of
the
case
when
congress
passes
an
act.
there
is
a
case
lodged
in
the
court,
and
that
court
will
follow
congress's
directions
and
dismiss
it.
but
until
it
does,
its
hold
final
judgment.
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court
is
suspended
while
it's
sub
judicata
before
the
ninth
circuit,
and
then
when
the
ninth
circuit
acts,
then
there
is
a
trigger.
but
until
there
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
been
without
authority
to
issue
the
orders
in
santos
under
your
reasoning.
the
ninth
circuit
is
powerless
because
the
authority
had
been
transferred
by
virtue
of
the
statute
to
this
court,
so
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
any
orders
it
issued.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
when
they
decide
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
then
it's
retroactive?
that's
what
your
position
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
has
jurisdiction
this
whole
time.
but
the
day
that
it
issues
its
decision
dismissing
this
case,
then
it
is
retroactive
back
to
the
date
that
congress
passed
the
statute?
that's
what
you
seem
to
be
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
cases
really
are
not
on
point.
because
there
was
a
vast
confusion
in
the
days
when
there
was
a
three-judge
court,
do
i
file
a
jurisdictional
statement,
do
i
file
a
cert
petition?
sometimes
this
court
said
we'll
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
cert
petition.
but
those
existed
from
the
beginning.
here
there's
a
case
lodged
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
had
every
basis
of
jurisdiction.
this
was
no
big
shakes
about
it.
it
wasn't,
did
they
file
the
right
paper?
and
then
congress
does
something.
and
the
court
would
follow
suit.
it
just
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
say
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
it
has
jurisdiction,
but
if
it
decides
it
doesn't,
then
the
date
of
that
order
is
not
the
critical
date,
but
you
go
back
to
the
date
that
congress
passed
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they
tax
on
the
basis
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
is
a
fractional,
this
35
percent.
in
the
other
places,
do
they
use
as--
the...
the
value
taxed
100
percent
of
the
property--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
just
have
a
lower
tax
rate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
this
value
issue...
i
mean,
was
the
borrowing
effective
given
the
controversy
between,
the
attorney
general
refused
to
sign,
did
that
have
any
consequences
for
whether
this
bond
issue
went
through?
