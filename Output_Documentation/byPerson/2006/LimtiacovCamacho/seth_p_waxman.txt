mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
properly
before
this
court,
which
should
reverse
under
the
plain
language
and
purpose
of
the
organic
act
of
guam.
as
to
jurisdiction,
at
the
time
congress
amended
the
organic
act
to
replace
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
the
ninth
circuit
with
direct
review
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
had
already
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
that
had
been
timely
filed
and
the
case
had
been
briefed,
argued
and
submitted.
the
amendment
said
nothing
about
its
application
to
pending
appeals,
and
someone
had
to
decide
whether
and
how
it
applied
to
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
proper
body
to
do
that,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
and
until
it
did,
this
case
was
before
that
court
within
the
meaning
of
gibbs
versus
wynn.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
did
decide
it
in
santos,
justice
scalia.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
for
reasons
that
we
articulate,
your
honor,
in
a...
i
forget
the
footnote
number,
but
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
there
are
some
important
distinctions,
although
they
turned
out
not
to
be
dispositive,
between
the
nature
and
position
of
this
case
and
santos.
but
in
any
event,
we
know
from
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
did
not
consider
it
otherwise,
because
if
the
court
will
refer
to
i
believe
it's
page
50a
or
51a
of
the
joint
appendix,
after
the
court
decided
santos,
it
sua
sponte
issued
an
order
in
this
case...
it
is
on
page
51a...
resubmitting
this
case
effective
february
1
to
the
ninth
circuit's
active
consideration.
and
shortly
thereafter,
it
filed
the
order
in
this
case
from
that...
in
our
view,
triggered
the
2101(c)
90-day
period.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
wouldn't
have
the
most,
the
strongest
argument
that
i
have
in
this
case.
i
think...
now,
the
court's
cases
are
not
clear
here
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
in
the
instance
as
here,
where
it
isn't
just
that
a
party
has
made
some
application
or
filed
a
cert
petition
with
a
court,
but
the
court
has
actually
reached
out
and
asserted
jurisdiction,
surely
anything
other
than
an
amendment
withdrawing...
that
an
active
withdrawing...
withdrawing
jurisdiction
that
requires
anything
other
than
merely
a
ministerial
act,
where
there
can
be
no
possible
confusion
about
what
congress
intended
to
do,
certainly
anything
short
of
that,
it
lies
with
the
court
to
ascertain
it.
and
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
actually
would
not
embrace
that
test.
i
think
that
in
an
instance,
your
honor,
where
a
court
in
which,
properly
had
jurisdiction
and
affirmatively
asserted
it
and
issued...
and
i
can
take
the
court
through
this...
a
series
of
orders
of
the
court,
following
this
19,
the
october
19,
2004
enactment
leading
up
to
the
decision
in
santos
and
thereafter,
which
the
court
continued
to
rule,
continued
to
issue
orders
in
this
case,
i
think
a
good
argument
can
be
made
that
on
a
theory
of
constitutional
avoidance
the
court
ought
to
construe
any
enactment
of
congress,
no
matter
how
pellucid
it
is,
as
not
constituting
a
self-effecting
reversal
of
a
preexisting
order
of
the
court
in
which
the
case
had
been
pending
per
order
of
the
court.
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
even
embrace
a
ministerial
test
concept
in
the
context
in
which
a
case
is
properly
pending
in
front
of
a
court
which
has
affirmatively
asserted
jurisdiction
over
it.
and
indeed
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
you
should...
well,
i
suppose
you
could
start
anywhere.
but
let's,
maybe
it
would
be
as
well
to
start
on
49a
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
december
15...
remember,
the
guam
organic
act
was
amended
i
believe
october
30,
19...
or
2004,
and
it
was
silent
as
to
its
effect
on
cases
that
had
already
been
filed
and
were
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit.
sua
sponte,
the
court...
well,
actually
it
was
not
sua
sponte.
almost
two
months
after
congress
enacted
the
organic
act,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
governor
camacho
filed
a
motion
on
december
8
with
the
court
renewing
a
previous
motion
for
the
court
to
expedite
its
resolution
in
this
case.
and
governor
camacho's
affidavit
in
support
of
that
motion
is
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
in
response
to
the
motion,
not
telling
the
court
hey,
by
the
way,
it's
been
nice
doing
business
with
you
but
we
have
no
further
truck
with
your
court
because
congress
passed
the
statute
and
you
are
ipso
facto
by
operation
of
law
no
longer
in
business,
the
ninth
circuit
issued
the
order
on
page
49a
that
says
no
opinion
in
this
case
can
issue
until
the
case
of
santos
is
decided
clarifying
our
continuing
certiorari
jurisdiction
over
decisions
from
the
guam
supreme
court.
then
turn
to
page
50a
of
the
joint
appendix.
a
week
later,
on
december
22,
the
court
sua
sponte
issues
an
order
withdrawing
and
deferring
a
ruling
in
this
case
pending
the
decision
in
santos.
santos
is
then
decided
in
january.
and
on
february
1,
the
court
issues
an
order
in
this
pending
case
saying
okay,
it's
resubmitted
to
the
panel.
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
panel
issued
the
order
dismissing
this
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
and
from
that
date
we
filed
a
timely
petition
for
certiorari.
now
the
contention
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
attorney
general
should
immediately
upon
enactment
of
the
organic
act
amendment
have
also
filed
a
petition
with
this
court
would
do
one
of
two
things.
it
either
would
have
put
this
court
in
the
position
of
determining
the
effect
of
the
amendment
at
the
very
same
time
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
doing
so,
which
is
a
state
of
affairs
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected,
most
notably
in
andrews
versus
virginia
railway,
or
it
would
have
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
what
this
court
has
called,
quote,
"the
filing
of
a
redundant
slip
of
paper.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
attorney...
there
were
two
cases
in
which
the
guam
supreme
court
issued
a
final...
its
own
final
ruling
after
the
october
30,
2004
amendment
of
the
organic
act.
and
in
that
instance,
the
organic
act
was
in
effect.
he
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
there
were
two
cases
that
were
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
over
which
the
ninth
circuit
had
granted
the
writ,
this
case
and
santos.
in
santos,
but
not
in
this
case,
the
court
asked
the
parties
to
file
supplemental
briefs
with
respect
to
the
court's
continued
jurisdiction,
and
the
attorney
general
did
so
in
this
case,
and
it's
discussed
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
attorney
general
could
have
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
before
judgment
in
this
court,
you
know,
at
any
time
prior
to
the
time
that
the
ninth
circuit
issued
its
order
dismissing
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
said
uniformly
outside
the
special
context
of
three-judge
courts
that
it
will
not
require
the
mere
filing
of
a
redundant
piece
of
paper,
to
quote
the
colville
indian
reservation
case,
and
it
has
declined
to
extend
this
well,
why
don't
you
just
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
but
that
is
actually
what
this
court
was
referring
to
in
the
colville
indian
reservation
case
and
other
cases
in
calling
it
redundant
in
the
sense
that
it
was
identical
or
effectively
identical
to
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
another
court
at
the
same
time.
in
the
three-judge
court
context,
justice
ginsburg,
although
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
direct
appeals
in
three-judge
courts
has
been
greatly
reduced
since
the
1950s
and
sixties
and
early
seventies,
there
are
certain
instances
that
this
court
has
realized
where
it
is
unclear
whether
an
appeal
lies
to
a
regional
court
of
appeals
or
to
this
court
and
it
is
unavoidable
there
that
you
would
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
both
instances;
but
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
there
was
any
uncertainty
about
where
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
guam
supreme
court's
decision
had
to
be
filed.
the
organic
act
said
the
ninth
circuit
had
certiorari
jurisdiction.
the
ninth
circuit
granted
the
petition
in
this
case
and
had
assumed
authority
over
it,
and
so--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
in
fact...
i
mean,
it's...
i
don't
think
that
anything
actually
turns
on
this
in
the
context
of
this
case,
but
it
is
quite
significant
that
at
the
time...
there
has
yet
never
been
any
appellate
determination
of
the
substantive
question
in
this
case.
the
guam
supreme
court
considered
this
as
a
court
of
first
instance
that
original
petition
was
filed
in
the
guam
supreme
court.
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
that
the
attorney
general
filed
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
the
only
place
the
attorney
general
of
guam
could
go
to
get
review
of
this
construction
by
a
territorial
court
sitting
as
a
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
of
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
we
just
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
this
is
an
instance
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
issued
both
before...
both
before
the
amendment
and
after
the
amendment
and
both
before
santos
and
after
santos
orders
reflecting
the
fact
that
it
believed
it
continued
to
have
authority
over
this
case,
the
appropriate
outcome
in
this
case
is
more
straightforward
than
it
might
be
in
some
other
closer
instances.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we
do.
i
have
spoken
personally
and
repeatedly
with
the
attorney
general,
who
is
with
me
at
counsel
table,
who
has
instructed
me
unequivocally
to
continue
vigorously
to
advocate
the
construction
of
the
organic
act
that
reflected
in
our
petition
and
in
our
merits
and
reply
brief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
actually
an
a
fortiori.
if
you
don't
agree
with
me
and
you
think
that
there
really
wasn't
a
case
or
controversy,
then
we
would
respectfully
submit
the
appropriate
resolution
would
be
to
dismiss
and
vacate
the
guam
supreme
court's
decision
so
that
the
attorney
general--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed.
but
here's
the
situation
here,
and
this
is
why
i
think
it's
an
a
fortiori
case.
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor
of
guam
are
each
separately
elected.
they
each
have
non-discretionary
obligations
under
guam
law
in
addition
to
their
obligation
to
interpret
and
enforce
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
attorney
general
cannot
be
removed
by,
by
the
governor,
by
guam
law,
unlike
the
case
in
many
of
these
federal
executive
branch
intramural
disputes;
and
she
is
required
by
guam
law
in
any
instance
in
which
the
governor
and
the
legislature
attempt
to
borrow
money
subject
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
territory
to
certify
that
such
borrowing
is
lawful.
and
in
this
instance,
therefore,
she
is,
as
the
unremovable
elected
chief
law
enforcement
of
the
territory,
she
is
required
both
to
properly
apply
the
federal
law
that,
the
organic
act
that
constitutes
guam's
constitution
and
guam
territorial
law
which
requires
her
affirmatively
to
certify
the
legality
of
the
proposed
buy-in.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
may
very...
it
may
very
well
occur.
in
fact,
there
either
is
or
imminently
will
be
a
proposed
additional
borrowing
of
$123
million
proposed
by
the
governor
to
the
legislature,
and
that
is
going
to
require
this
attorney
general
to
ascertain,
presumably
prior
to
the
time
this
court...
well,
i
won't
presume,
but
perhaps
before
this
court
renders
a
decision
in
this
case
were
it
to,
whether
she
can
or
cannot
certify
that.
now,
the
answer
to
that
question
will
turn
in
the
first
instance...
and
she's
not
going
to
be
reelected
before
then.
she
can't
be
removed
by
the
governor
before
then.
her
position
is
that
if
she
ascertains
that
in
the
form
in
which
it's
enacted
that
proposed
borrowing
implicates,
you
know,
constitutes
debt
within
the
meaning
of
section
11,
she
will
not
sign
that
legislation.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
during
the
campaign...
of
course,
none
of
this
is
in
the
record...
her
position
was
that
she
would
continue
to
pursue
this
litigation
in
the
supreme
court,
which
is
why
she's
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
her
position
that
if
she
were
presented
tomorrow
with
a
borrowing
that
would
exceed
the
debt
caps
under
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
case,
she
will
not
sign
it
because
that
constitutes
her
interpretation
of
the
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
you
should
reach
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
i
have
four
reasons
why
i
think
we
are
correct--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
they...
what's
happening
in
all
those
jurisdictions
will
certainly
consume
at
least
the
rest
of
the
balance
of
my
time.
the
simple
answer
is
that...
is
the
following.
there
are...
looking
first
at
the
states,
there
are
states
that
use
the
term
"the
valuation".
there
are
states
that
use
"the
assessed
valuation",
"aggregate
assessed
valuation",
and
there
are
a
few
states
that
use
"tax
valuation".
it
is
uniformly
the
case
in
the
states
and
elsewhere
that
the
word
"assessed"
in
this
context
is
understood
to
refer
to
the
valuation
against
which
the
property
tax
is
based,
whether
that
happens
to
be
a
place
where
it
is
full
value
or
a
fractional
value;
but
it
is
also
the
case
that
at
the
time
that
the
guam
supreme...
that
the
guam
organic
act
was
enacted
fractional
valuation
was
a
commonplace
for
purposes
of--
assessing
property
tax.
now,
in
the
territories--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
were
three
states
that
we
discussed,
passy
is
one,
halsey
is
the
other
and
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
the
other
one,
where
they
used...
where
the
state
constitution
just
said
"aggregate
valuation"
or
"the
valuation"
and
the
state
supreme
court
said:
there's
no
modifier
for
valuation;
that
must
mean
full
value.
there
are,
conversely,
the
state
supreme
court
in
fishburn
in
the
illinois
context
and
in
the
indiana
context
where
even
that
formulation,
"the
valuation",
the
state
supreme
court
said:
come
on,
it
is...
the
debt
limitation
is
always
calculated--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely
nothing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's...
the
limit
in
the
organic
act,
and
it
makes
it
entirely
consistent
with
all
of
the
other
territories
that
i...
are
not
that
many
and
i
will
explicate...
which
is
the
uniform
rule
has
been
that
the
basis
for
valuation
of
property
against
which
the
debt
limitation
percentage
is
multiplied
is
the
same
as
the
valuation
of
property
against
which
the
property
taxes
apply.
and
in
the
territories
the
congress
has
used
essentially
two
formulations:
in
the
springer
act
it
was
"assessed
value
of
taxable
property".
in
alaska,
it
was
"aggregate
taxable
value".
in
guam
it's
"aggregate
tax
valuation".
in
hawaii,
it
was
"assessed
value";
in
the
northern
marianas,
"aggregate
assessed
valuation".
the
philippines,
which
you
mentioned,
is
a
particularly
instructive
example
because
in
1902
and
1905
it
was
1916
and
1922,
it
was
altered
to
be
"aggregate
tax
valuation".
and
then
the
virgin...
puerto
rico
is
"aggregate
tax
valuation"
and
the
virgin
islands,
which
we've
discussed,
is
"aggregate
assessed
valuation".
now,
the
legislative
histories
of
these
provisions,
including
the
guam
provision,
are
lengthy,
obscure
and
frankly
have
been
very
difficult
to
obtain
because
in
many
instances
the
hearings
are
unreported.
and
we
have
been
receiving
the
legislative
history,
particularly
the
unpublished
legislative
histories,
of
these
provisions
up
to
and
including
saturday
because
in
the
11
days
over
the
christmas
holiday
in
which
we
did
our
reply
brief
we
simply
could
not
get
hearing,
transcripts
of
hearings
that
were
conducted
in
1949
in
that
agana,
guam.
but
we
are
prepared
to
lodge
the
relevant
provisions
with
the
court
for
the
court,
and
i
don't
want
to,
therefore
don't
want
to
make
any
argument
about
it,
but
i
don't
want
to
say
that
these
words--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
would
be
hard
to
find
out,
and
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
there
is
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
word
"assessed"
and
tax
in
this
context
both
in
puerto
rico
and
in
the
philippines.
i
don't
know
about
alaska.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not...
our
argument
is
that
the
word
"tax
valuation"
has
to
have
meaning;
and
the
plainest
meaning
is
the
meaning,
we
respectfully
submit,
the
most
natural
meaning
of
"tax
valuation"
is
the
valuation
that
is
used
by
guam
for
the
calculation
of
tax.
and
that's
true
not
only
as
a
matter
of
plain
language,
but
for
three
other
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
i
indicated,
it
puts
guam
in
harmony
with
the
regime
that
has
existed
in
every
other
u.s.
territory
in
which
the
value
of
property
against
which
the
debt
limitation
rate
is
assessed
is
the
same
as
the
value
of
property
against
which
the
tax
rate
is
assessed.
and
secondly,
or
thirdly,
that
fully
accords
with
the
statutory
and
legislative
history
both
with
respect
to
the
territories
and
the
states
that
reflects
that
it
has
always
been
understood
that
tax
valuation
and
assessed
valuation
are
equivalent
in
this
context,
and
understanding
that
furthers
congress's
consistent
goal
of
restraining
borrowing
by
territories.
and
finally,
interpreting
tax
to
mean
full
renders
the
word
tax
all
but
meaningless.
i
grant
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
is
possible
to
come
up
with
a
meaning.
it
is
not
a
meaning
that
the
guam
supreme
court
adopted
but
it
is
a
possible
meaning;
but
the
guam
supreme
court
interprets...
actually
said
in
its
opinion,
tax
has
to
mean
something.
it
interpreted
tax
not
to
modify
valuation,
the
word
that
follows
it,
but
to
modify
the
word
"property",
and
to
read
it
as
taxable
property,
which
is
with
all
respect
plainly
wrong.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
i
don't
have
any
such
opinion
letters.
and
i
would
therefore,
much
like
to
reserve
at
least
a
minute
for
rebuttal.
but
with
respect--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you.
with
respect
to
puerto
rico,
puerto
rico
happens
to
be
a
situation
which
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain,
the
law
actually
requires
that
for
purposes
of
determining
valuation
for
application
of
the
tax
rate,
the
assessed
rate
is
required
to
be
the
actual
value,
as
is
the
case
in
the
virgin
islands.
so
that
distinction
wouldn't
exist.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
philippines,
it
is
clear
from
1902
on
that
a
system
of
fractional
valuation
was
in
place.
now,
getting...
figuring
out
what
actually
happened
in
the
philippines
way
back
when,
when
it
was
a
territory
of
the
united
states,
has
been
challenging
and
its
may
very
well
be
that
there
is
information;
but
simply,
simply
obtaining
for
example,
the...
the
three
unpublished
hearings
with
respect
to
the
virgin
islands
legislation
in
1949
has
been
actually
surprisingly...
surprisingly
challenging.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
direct
the
court...
in
response
to
two
questions
that
were
asked
of
ms.
brinkmann,
i
want
to
direct
the
court
to
two
pages
of
the
guam
supreme
court's
opinion,
and
i'm
going
to
summarize
them
for
you
now,
but
for
purposes
of
what's
the
difference
between
in
terms
of
bond
holders,
the
fact
that
certain
property
isn't
taxed
at
all
and
certain
property
is
only
taxed
at
35
percent,
what's
important
to
note
here,
and
that
is
reflected
at
page
26a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
tax
roll
on
guam
includes
a
valuation
of
all
nontaxable
property.
the
guam
supreme
court
then
has
to
go
back
and
say,
well,
of
this
approximately
183
million
is
exempt.
so
in
guam,
the
tax
assessor
and
the
guam
courts
are
treating
property
that
is
wholly
exempt
from
taxation
the
same
way
that
it
treats
the
two-thirds
of
fair
market
value
that
is
exempt
from
application
of
the
tax
rate.
secondly,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
questions
about
why
are
we
focusing...
why
wouldn't
bond
holders
focus
on
assessed
valuation
rather
than
the
rest
and
what
difference
does
all
of
this
make,
page
18a
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
footnote
8
of
the
guam
supreme
court's
opinion,
which
comes
in
the...
the
portion
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
says,
look,
"tax"
has
to
mean
something;
we
think
it
means
taxable
property,
not
tax
valuation.
the
guam
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
in
footnote
8,
quoting
from
some
language
from
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
says
as
follows,
and
i'm
quoting
from
footnote
8:
"it
has
been
argued
that
the
use
of
a
percentage
of
assessed
value
as
a
measure
of
the
state
debt
limit
is
without
significance.
"
now
skipping
the
rest
of
the
sentence.
"the
people
that
buy
the
bonds
are
interested
in
the
ratio
of
your
debt
to
your
assessed
value
because,
while
all
of
the
tax
revenues
of
the
state
or
the
counties
naturally
are
available
for
the
payment
of
the
debt,
it's
been
customary
for
bond
holders
to
look
to
the
real
property
tax
as
their
collateral.
"
that
is
the
authority
on
which
the
guam
supreme
court
relied
and
it
applies
to
this
case
and
it
explain
why
the
word
ms.
brinkmann
addressed,
but
even
where
it's
full
value,
it
is
only
pursuant
to
a
determination
that
for
assessment
purposes
full
value
should
be
used.
