mr.
waxman,
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
did
decide
that
question
in
another
case
that
was
pending,
santos.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wasn't
that
the
time
at
which
it
was
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
no
longer
had
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
she
is
removable
by
election,
and
that
is
indeed
what
has
happened.
and
i
understand
that
one
of
the
issues
in
the
election
was
precisely
whether
this
borrowing
authority
existed
or
not.
and
if
that's
the
case,
you
have
a
new
attorney
general
that
presumably
as
an
original
matter
would
not
do
what
the
prior
attorney
general
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
an
intrabranch
dispute
that
can
be
resolved
by
the
electorate
essentially.
justice
antonin
scalia
please
don't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if,
what
if
you
have
an
ambiguous
statute
where
it
really
is
not
clear
whether
it
applies
to
pending
cases
or
not?
what,
what...
you
say
if
it
turns
out
after
the
fact
that
it
does
apply
to
pending
cases,
you
are
out
of
time,
if
you
haven't
immediately
filed
here
while
the
case
is
still...
is
still
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
say
santos,
then,
is...
is...
is
the
rubicon?
not
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
but
santos?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
your
last
argument,
then,
is
irrelevant.
i
mean
if
it's
clear,
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
did
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
100
percent.
they
could
change
what
you
call
the
tax
valuation
from
100
percent
of
the
fair
value
to
150
percent.
there's
really
much
less
to
this
case
than
meets
the
eye.
i
mean,
guam
is
going
to
be
able
to
fiddle
with
this
thing
no
matter
how
you
come
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whether
it
was
their
intent
or
not,
is
it
not
the
case
that
guam
could
say
all
property
will
be
valued
at
150
percent
of
its
fair
market
value
and
we
will
then
impose
a
1
percent
real
estate
tax
instead
of
the
2
percent,
or
instead
of
the--
1.5
percent
we
had
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
cannot
imagine
that
if
a
territory
of
the
united
states
goes
belly
up,
that
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
foot
the
bill.
i
just
can't
imagine
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
tell
me
whether
the
rate
of
tax
is
uniform
throughout
guam?
the
rate
of
real
estate
tax.
is
it
an
island-wide
tax
or
is
it
local,
county?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
just
didn't
raise
your
assessed
value
from
30
percent
to
100
percent
and
reduce
the
rate
of
tax
accordingly.
