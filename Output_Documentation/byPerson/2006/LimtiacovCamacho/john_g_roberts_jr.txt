chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-116,
limtiaco
versus
camacho.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
sense
in
which
it's
redundant,
though.
it
would
have
been
the
first
piece
of
paper
that
this
court
would
have
seen
in
the
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
a
more
basic
question,
whether
we
had
a
case
or
controversy
to
start
with.
this
is
kind
of
an
intramural
dispute
between
two
guamanian
officials
about
what
guam's
position
should
be
with
respect
to
the
organic
act
and
i'm
wondering
why
that's
a
justiciable
controversy
under
article
iii.
the
cases
you
cited
in
your
petition
all
involved
on
its...
only
facially
intra...
interbranch
disputes
within
the
federal
government;
but
the
agencies
in
those
cases
always...
were
representing
a
real
party
in
interest.
united
states
versus
icc,
the
icc
was
actually
the
railroad
in
whose
favor
the
had
commission
ruled.
why
shouldn't
we
just
let
guam
figure
out
its
position
on
its
own
and
then
when
a
private
party
with
standing
challenges
something
then
we'll
have
a
case
or
controversy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
guam...
presumably,
some
state
courts
issue
advisory
opinions.
we
don't...
that's
their
business.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
to
address
the
question
in
that
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
mr.
waxman,
we've
taken
a
fair
amount
of
your
time
before
you
got
to
the
merits.
so
we'll
give
you
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
why
don't
you
answer
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
ms.
brinkmann?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
subject
to
gamesmanship?
parties
that
are
out
of
time
in
this
court
going
to
a
lower
court
and
saying
well,
just
vacate
and
re-enter,
and
then
i
can
start
all
over
again?
we've
discouraged
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
don't
you
know
that
your
interpretation
reads
the
word
tax
out
of
this
statute?
i
mean
your
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
it
just
said
10
percent
of
the
value
of
the
property
in
guam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect
to
much
of
the
tax
exempt
property,
that
could
be
changed
by
the
legislature
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
was
the
appraisal
practice?
i
mean,
in
a
lot
of
these
jurisdictions
you
have
appraised
value
that
turns
out
to
be
30
percent
of
the
actual
market
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
doesn't
it...
who
is
this
provision
designed
to
protect,
just
the
guamanian
taxpayers
or
federal
taxpayers
more
generally?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
guamanian
government
runs
a
deficit,
where
is
the
difference
made
up
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
that
any
taxes
from
guam
are
returned
to
guam.
are
additional
tax
revenues
given
to
guam
other
than
those
that
are
derived
from
guam?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
the
guamanian
treasury
runs
into
difficulty,
it's
made
up
not
just
by
guamanian
taxpayers,
but
by
all
federal
taxpayers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
you
talked
about
this
as
the
deference
we
owe
to
the
guam
supreme
court.
this
is
a
federal
statute,
right?
this
was
passed
by
congress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
apply
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
organic
act?
i
mean,
there
are
provisions
there
addressing
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
we
are
considering
here
as
well.
do
we
defer
to
the
guam
supreme
court's
view
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
fine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
give
you
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
case
06-116,
limtiaco
versus
camacho.
