i
have
a
question,
if
i
can,
if
we
should
reach
the
merits
of
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
that.
that
isn't
it.
i
have
a
question
about...
i
have
a
question
about
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
have
a
question
i'd
like
you
to
go
into.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
looked
up,
my
law
clerk
has,
and
found
eight
states
that
seem
roughly
comparable.
those
that
go
to
assessed
value,
every
single
one
of
them...
and
most
of
them
do...
they
have
the
word
like
"assessment".
the
only
comparable
places
we
found
are
puerto
rico,
philippines
in
1916,
and
guam
here
which
don't
use
the
word
"assessment",
but
use
the
words
"aggregate
taxable
value".
all
right.
now,
what's
happened
in
those
places?
we
know
what's
happening
in
guam.
i
can't...
with
the
philippines
in
1916
and
puerto
rico,
there
ought
to
be
some
experience
there
even
if
we
couldn't
find
a
case
how
they
treated
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
try
utah,
try
iowa.
try--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question
is
the
following.
in
puerto
rico
and
in
the
philippines
after
1916,
and
in
alaska,
were
there
any
instances
in
which
they
issued
bonds
that
exceeded
the
10
percent
of
the
assessed
value
as
opposed
to
the
aggregate
market
value?
they
either
did
or
didn't
and
that
shouldn't
be
hard
to
find
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
big
lenders
in
the
united
states
and
those
people
don't
fool
around.
they
get
opinions.
and
they
lend
money
to
puerto
rico
or
they
lend
money
to
some
of
these
places.
they're
going
to
have
opinion
letters.
and
those
opinion
letters
are
going
to
say
whether
they
think
in
their
opinion
this
is
over
reaching
to
many
bonds
or
not.
and
of
course,
i
would
think
those
opinion
letters
would
say
for
puerto
rico,
what
the
words
aggregate
tax
valuation
mean.
they
might
or
might
not.
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
find
ways
of
getting
the
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble
on
your
side.
i
can't
get
very
far
with
a
history
of
other
places.
apparently
i
can't
get
there.
tax
doesn't
seem
to
help
me
very
much.
so
i
thought,
well,
one
thing
is
clear.
what
they're
trying
to
do
here
is
they
take
out
of
the
box,
if
you
look
at
it,
take
all
of
the
list
of
property
that
they
don't
tax.
i
guess
a
school,
maybe
some
tax
exempt
business
or
something.
now
their
reason
for
doing
that
must
be
that
those
people
who
they've
exempted
entirely
by
statute
are
not
going
to
be
much
help
in
paying
guam.
well,
if
that's
true,
isn't
precisely
the
same
thing
true
of
the
two-thirds
of
the
property
that--
they
don't
take
into
account
when
they
set
their
taxes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
doesn't
secure
it
one
bit
if,
in
fact,
the
tax
statute
says
you
can't
take
it
into
account
when
you
set
your
taxes.
just
as
is
true
of,
let's
say,
a
tax
free
business
of
some
kind.
now
guam
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
it
could
change
its
statute,
but
so
could
it
change
its
statute
in
respect
to
a
school,
a
university,
or
whatever
the
other
things
are
that
are
off
those
tax
rolls.
you
know
that,
you
know,
your
answer
was
circular.
that
assumes
that
the
whole
property
is,
but
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one?
you
say
they've
all
used
market
values?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
which
of
the
ones
that
use
it
have
in
fact
an
assessed
value
that
is
a
percentage
of
market
value?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
that
doesn't
help
us
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
could
look
at
hawaii.
in
hawaii
they
use
the
word
assessed
value.
they
couldn't
possibly
have
wanted
it
to
be
market
value,
i
wouldn't
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
the
district
of
columbia...
where
are
we
on
this?
it's
something
else
in
d.c.
they
use
assessed
value
in
the
virgin
islands.
