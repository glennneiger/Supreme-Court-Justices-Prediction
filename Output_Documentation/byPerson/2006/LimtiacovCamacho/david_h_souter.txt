justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
that
means.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
say
i
will
pursue
the
litigation
because
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
a
definitive
answer
from
someone
other
than
the
governor
or
me.
is
it
her
position
at
the
present
time
that
the
position
of
her
predecessor
is
correct
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
she
adopts
the
interpretation
of
her
predecessor?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
this
case
if
it
was
not
a
false
exercise
in
santos,
why
was
it
a
false
exercise
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it,
it,
it
was
still
an
exercise...
it
was
an
exercise
in
this
case
of
the
same
authority
that
it
was
purporting
to
exercise
in
santos,
which
you
conceded.
and
that
is
the
authority
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction.
i
presume
that
jurisdiction
is
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
when
a
case
has
already
been
accepted
by
the
court,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
said
is
sub
judice.
so
if
there
was,
if
there
was
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction
in
santos,
i
don't
see
why
there
wasn't
likewise
jurisdiction
to
determine
it
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
once
the...
once
the
ninth
circuit
determined
that
it
had
no
longer
a
continuing
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
more
than
it
did,
in
the
order
that
finally
dismissed
this,
the
other
side
wasn't
bound
to
litigate
that
here.
all
the
other
side
is
saying
is
that
up
to
that
point,
the
court
was
determining
its
own
jurisdiction.
and
therefore
it
is
only
when
it
determined
that
its
jurisdiction
no
longer
existed,
that
the
filing
period
began
to
run.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
crucial
question
is
if
it
could
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
in
santos
which
you
concede,
why
can't
it
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
it
was
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those...
those...
are
they...
and
you
have
got
me
here.
the
argument
here
is
that
the,
that
the
ninth
circuit
already
had
taken
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
whether
to
accept
it
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
guess
i'm
still
at
a
loss
on
the
point
that
for
one
purpose,
the
purpose
of
the
90-day
filing
period,
you're
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction;
but
for
another
purpose,
the
determination
of
whether
it
had
jurisdiction,
you're
saying
it
does
have
jurisdiction.
am
i
misunderstanding
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
should
say
i
don't
know
why
this
court
can
have
it
both
ways.
[laughter]
don't,
don't
we
have
to
choose
one
analytical
path
or
the
other
analytical
path?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
why
does
it
do
any
more
than
the
35
percent
value?
that
sets
a
definite
limit.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
without
any
responsibility
to
the
voters.
i
mean,
the
voters
are
going
to
know
that
if
the
valuation
is
changed
and
the
tax
rate
isn't,
their
taxes
are
going
up.
so
i
assume
the
voters
are
going
to
be
vigilant
to
what
is
going
on
and
i
assume
they
have
telephones
and
they'll
call
their
representatives.
why
is
this...
why
do
you
posit
this
sort
of
failure
of
representative
democracy?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
tax
rate
is
changed,
they're
going
to
call
twice.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they're
going
to
know
this.
i
mean,
they're
going
to
be,
if
they
are
concerned
at
all
about
it,
they'll
be
in
touch
with
their
representatives.
