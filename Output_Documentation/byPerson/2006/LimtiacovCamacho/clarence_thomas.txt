justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam.
the
guam
legislature
authorized
respondent,
the
governor
of
guam
to
issue
bonds
to
fund
the
territory’s
continuing
obligations.
petitioner
guam’s
attorney
general
refused
to
sign
the
contracts
necessary
to
issue
the
bonds
because
he
believed
the
bonds
would
violate
the
debt-limitation
provision
in
guam’s
organic
act.
respondent
sought
a
declaration
in
the
guam
supreme
court
that
the
bond
issue
would
not
violate
the
organic
facts
debt-limitation
and
the
guam
supreme
court
agreed
reasoning
that
guam’s
debt
limit
had
to
be
calculated
by
using
the
appraised
value
of
property
in
guam.
petitioner
initially
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
but
after
congress
removed
the
ninth
circuit’s
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
the
courts
of
guam,
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
petitioner’s
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
petitioner
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court.
we
hold
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
was
timely
filed.
certiorari
petitions
must
be
filed
within
90
days
of
the
entry
of
judgment
in
the
lower
court.
although
petitioner
filed
the
petition
more
than
90
days
after
the
guam’s
supreme
court’s
judgment
dependency
of
theappeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
suspended
the
finality
of
that
judgment.
by
agreeing
to
hear
petitioner’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
possibility
that
it
might
modify
the
judgment
or
alter
the
party’s
rights.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court
did
not
become
final
for
purposes
of
this
court’s
review
until
the
court
of
appeals
dismiss
the
appeal.
as
to
the
merits,
guam’s
organic
act
limits
the
territories
allow
debt
to
10%
of
the
aggregate
tax
valuation
of
property
in
the
guam.
the
guam
supreme
court
held
that
the
term
“tax
valuation”
in
the
organic
act
refers
to
“appraised
valuation”
not
assessed
valuation.
the
tax
valuation
most
naturally
means
the
“value
to
which
the
tax
rate
is
applied”
tax
valuation
must
therefore
mean
“assess
valuation”
which
is
then
defined
as
the
“valuation
of
property
for
purposes
of
taxation.”
one
would
not
normally
refer
to
a
property’s
appraised
valuation
as
its
tax
valuation.
appraised
valuation
is
simply
market
value
which
may
or
may
not
relate
to
taxation.
it
is
true
that
congress
could
have
made
its
intent
clear
or
even
clearer
by
using
the
term
assess
valuation
as
it
did
in
the
debt-limitation
provisions
for
the
virgin
islands.
but
if
congress
had
intended
to
refer
to
actual
market
or
appraised
value
it
could
have
used
any
of
those
terms
as
well.
we
therefore
hold
that
guam’s
debt
limit
must
be
calculated
using
assess
valuation
not
appraised
valuation.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg,
and
alito
join.
