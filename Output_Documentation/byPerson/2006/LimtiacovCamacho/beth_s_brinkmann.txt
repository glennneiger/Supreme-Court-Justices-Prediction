ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction
because
the
certiorari
petition
filed
in
this
court
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court
was
untimely.
if
the
court
were
nonetheless
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
opinion
of
the
case,
the
opinion
of
the
guam
supreme
court
interpreting
section
11
of
the
organic
act
should
be
affirmed.
there
are
three
principal
reasons
supporting
both
of
these
positions.
first,
on
the
dismissal:
dismissal
is
required,
one,
because
when
the
ninth
circuit
was
divested
of
authority
to
adjudicate
the
merits
of
the
case,
on
october
30th,
2004,
this
court
was
then
the
only
court
that
could
review
that
judgment.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
respectfully
disagree.
we
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
suspension
of
the
time
for
filing
once
the
ninth
circuit
was
divested
of
jurisdiction.
this
court
as
long
ago
as
the
eisenberg
case
has
recognized
that
the
time
for
filing
certiorari
is
suspended
so
long
as
a
lower
court
has
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
court
reinforced
that
more
recently--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
the
situation
that
the
court
confronts
in
the
three-judge
district
court
cases
within
in
the
instances
in
which
there
was
a
mistake
made
as
to
where
the
appeal
should
be
taken.
and
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide,
the
jurisdiction
in
those
instances
has
vacated
and
remanded
the
order.
i
want
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
in
the
santos
case,
petitioner
requested
that
the
ninth
circuit
remand
the
order
to
the
guam
supreme
court,
and
in
the
language
of
this
court,
what
that
does
is
it
refreshes
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court
so
that
it
can
timely
brought
here.
if
petitioner--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
we
believe
under
the
authority
of
this
court
in
those
three-judge
courts,
that
is
the
solution
that
this
court
has
established--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
petitioner
agreed
that,
he
asked
for
that
relief
in
the
santos
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
not,
your
honor.
in
the
donovan
ricky
richland
case,
the
court
made
clear
you
would
not
vacate
it
when
it
was
simply
a
failure
to
obey
the
rules.
the
court
refused
to
vacate
and
remand
in
that
case,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
this
is
a
case
such
as
justice
scalia
was
positing
where
there
is
an
actual
issue
of,
colorable
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
proper
course
would
to
be
to
challenge,
and
here
petitioner
did
not
even
try
to
litigate
the
question,
did
not
file
any
brief
after
santos
came
down,
never
tried
to
distinguish
this
case
from
santos.
he
merely
waited
and
did
not
timely
pursue
the
writ
of
the
guam
supreme
court,
the
judgment
that
was
final
at
that
point
in
time.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no
we
believe
in
this
particular
instance,
particularly
on,
with
the
clarity
under
brunner,
of
the
divestiture
of
the
ninth
circuit
jurisdiction
here.
this
is
not
a
rule
of
force.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
i'm
suggesting
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
that
in
those
other
situations
where
there
may
be
a
question,
that
does
not
put
the
petitioner
in
a
situation
of
not
being
able
to
seek
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
maintained
jurisdiction
to
decide
jurisdiction.
and
indeed
if
petitioner
had
litigated
the
question
of
jurisdiction
they
could
have
brought
a
writ
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
come
to
this
court
and
litigated
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
had
found
there
was
jurisdiction
it
could
have
reached
the
merits.
if
the
court
had
found
it
was
not,
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
it
would
have...
in
the
three-judge
courts
and
said
no,
you
need
to
come
directly
up
from
the
guam
supreme
court
with
vacate
and
remand
for
a
fresh
judgment,
and
then
you
come
to
the
guam
supreme
court.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
90
days
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
timely
petition
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
grant
of
certiorari
would
have
suspended
the
finality
of
the
guam
supreme
court
judgment.
once
congress
in
its
authority
to
demarcate
the
jurisdictions
of
the
lower
federal
courts
had
passed
that
the
statute,
it
was
no...
for
no
court
to
question
that,
was
divested
jurisdiction
at
that
time.
the
guam
supreme
court
judgment
was
again
final
and
it
had
90
days
to
petition.
i
should
say
there
are
other
cases.
eisenberg
makes
clear
that
time
was
not
suspended
when
the
court
below
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
market
street
railways
case
makes
clear
when
as
a
matter
of
law
the
lower
court
no
longer
can
act
on
the
case,
the
time
is
no
longer
suspended.
and
the
jesse
oil
case
makes
clear
that
the
party
can
not
rely
on
a
false
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
lower
court.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
was
not
a
false
exercise,
your
honor,
until
october
30
of
2004.
at
that
time
congress
spoke.
and
what
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--there
was
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
our
position
is
the
same
in
both
of
those
cases.
and
indeed
if
that
issue
of
jurisdiction
had
been
litigated
in
this
case,
petitioner
could
have
brought
a
writ
to
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
and
litigated
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
but
if
the
courts
ultimately
determined
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction,
it
had--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
can,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
but
if
it
is
found
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
then
the
party
cannot
have
relied
on
that
to
suspend--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
this
court's
cases
make
clear,
the
wynn,
eisenberg
case--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
the
courts
also...
appellate
courts
were
undoubtedly
exercising
jurisdiction
in
those
cases.
and
in
eisenberg,
for
example,
it
was
a
request
to
recall
the
remittitur.
it
took
months
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
decide
that
case.
and
they
said
yes,
there's
a
standard
where
you
can
do
that
there...
the
court.
we
find
you
don't
make
it,
so
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
they
came
to
this
court
and
said
out
of
time.
you
had
to
have
sought
our
review
timely,
from
the
final
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court,
you
could
not
wait
for
that
period
of
time
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
decided
to
not
have
jurisdiction.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
is
a
well
established
federal
jurisdiction
principle.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that's
very
common--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well
this
court
has
made
clear,
for
example,
in
the
three-judge
district
court
cases,
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
when
an
appeal
comes
before
it,
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
has
jurisdiction
over
that
appeal.
when
parties
have
made--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
rests
in
this
whole
idea
that
courts
have
to
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
jurisdiction.
but
when
you're--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
divestiture
of
the
jurisdiction
occurred
on
the
date
that
congress's
statute
went
into
effect.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
that
would
have
been
the
scenario
i
discussed
before,
the
parties
could
have
litigated
that.
if
it
came
to
this
court,
and
the
court
found
there
was
jurisdiction,
so
be
it.
we
think
it
would
have
been
a
wrong
ruling.
and
if
it
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
reversed,
that
is
the
scenario
we
discussed,
where
in
the
three-judge
district
court
when
that
turns
out,
the
court
says
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
you
needed
to
come
up
through
the
other
route,
we
will
dismiss,
vacate
and
send
back
and
come
up.
now
i
have
to
urge
on
the
court
there's
a
purpose
for
that.
in
those
cases
the
party
is
actively
believing
and
pursuing
the
view
that
jurisdiction
exists.
in
this
case
that
was
not
the
scenario.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
addressed
this
scenario,
and
one
of
two
things
could
have
happened.
as
you
pointed
out
during
petitioner's
argument,
it
would
have
been
an
easy
thing
to
file
a
protective
cert
position.
this
court
is
well
familiar,
has
recognized
the
appropriate
of
protective
filings...
certainly
in
the
federal
habeas
situation
where
there
are
mixed
petitions
and
we
go
back
in
thought,
protective
filing
within
the
90-day
period
would
have
been
appropriate.
and
i
urge,
particularly
because
petitioner
filed
a
brief
within
that
period
in
the
santos
case,
recognizing
that
brunner
required
that
there
was
a
divestiture
of
ninth
circuit
jurisdiction
as
of
the
day
of
the
statute
enactment.
even
if
there
had
not
been
that
protective
filing,
if
petitioner
had
a
colorable
jurisdiction
argument
and
litigated
it,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
once
that
has
been
determined
adversely,
there
can
be
a
vacation
and
remand
back
to
the
guam
supreme
court
so
that
judgment
can
be
brought
up.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
if
i
could,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
well-reasoned
opinion
of
the
guam
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
interpretation
takes
full
account
of
the
text
of
the
statute.
as
justice
kennedy
was
mentioning
before,
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
have
a
debt
limitation
that
is
based
on
the
property
in
guam
and
the
tax
valuation
of
that
property
in
guam.
the
tax
valuation
is
the
valuation
of
the
property
that
is
subject
to
tax.
this
is
not
an
original
interpretation
of
this
provision.
in
the
superior
court
opinion
from
1989
that
we
attached
to
our
brief
in
opposition,
the
guam
supreme
court
came
to
the
same
conclusion
and
interpretation
of
this
language.
we
think
it
is
an
eminently
reasonable
and
correct
interpretation,
particularly
in
light
of
the
absence
of
the
word
as
set.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
that
would
include
the
tax-exempt
property.
that
would
be
a
much
larger
number.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
that
property
in
guam
is
still
securing
this
debt
to
a
certain
degree.
it
is
property
that
must
be
valued
for
tax
purposes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
textual
interpretation
as
to
the
tax
valuation
of
property
in
guam,
you
look
at
the
property
in
guam
and
then
you
have
to
take
the
tax
valuation.
you're
taking
the
property
that
is
subject
to
tax.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
intent
of
congress
also
for
two
reasons,
justice
breyer,
that
addressed
your
issues
before
about
one
suggestion
that
guam
could
change
this.
the
purpose
of
congress
here
was
to
set
a
meaningful
debt
limit.
that
is
what
real
value
appraisal
value
does.
it
is
an
economic
determination
of
currency
fact.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
that
could
be
changed
at
the
whim
of
the
legislature,
your
honor,
and
the
legislature
could
change
that
assessment
to
increase
the
debt
limit
and...
while
lowering
taxes
and
altering
any
tax
liability.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
when
you're
looking
to
a
bond
debt
limitation,
you're
looking
at
the
bond
market,
you're
looking
at
investors,
the
certainty
of
an
appraisal
value,
actual
real
value,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
don't
believe
that
was
the
intent
of
congress.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
they
certainly
could
do
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
we
don't
believe
that
should
alter
the
debt
limitation
congress
enacted,
and
that's
precisely
why
we
believe
that
the
guam
supreme
court
opinion
gives
a
meaningful
interpretation
of
the
purpose
of
congress
and
gives
a
real
debt
limitation
that
exactly
should
be
affirmed
as
exactly
the
purpose
that
congress
intended.
and
that's
why
the
assessed
value
can
be
so
easily
manipulated,
and
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
also
would
like
to
address
justice
breyer's
question
about
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
uncertainty,
however,
that
the
debt
limitation
is
a
real
limitation
that
serves
the
purpose
of
congress
in
order
to
have
some
kind
of
fiscal
responsibility
to
the
territory
is
what
is
furthered
by
the
real
limitation
of
having
a
concrete
appraisal
full
value
as
a
basis
for
the
calculations.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
that
can
be
changed
at
the
whim
of
the
legislature
without
any
accountability
to
the
voters
because
at
the
same
time
that
they
change
the
tax
rate
and
not
alter
any
tax
liability.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
i
assume
the
tax
rate
will
be
changed,
so
it's
not
just...
there's
no--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
the
tax
rate
will
be
changed
to
be
lower
to
maintain
the
same
level,
so
there
would
be
no...
because
the
legislature
isn't
acting
to
address
any
tax
liability.
they're
simply
asking
to
manipulate
the
debt
limitation,
which
is
very
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
any
meaningful
message
that
debt
limitation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
of
course
the
bond
issuance
here
also
goes
to
the
guam
legislature
and
they
are
held
accountable
for
that
in
the
political
arena.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
the
question
about...
i
agree
with
petitioner's
counsel
about
the
certainty
of
determining
some
of
this
historical
material
is
difficult
and
not
precise.
but
we
have
gone
back
and
looked
at
the
contemporaneous
statutes
in
each
of
these
territorial
jurisdictions,
and
as
mr.
waxman
pointed
out,
puerto
rico
it
turns
out
actually
uses
the
actual
value,
all
of
them
use
the
actual
value.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yeah.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yeah.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
here,
in
the
virgin
islands
and
alaska,
federal
law
requires
that
the
taxes
be
imposed
on
the
actual
value.
in
the
virgin
islands
it
said
your
assessment
will
be
actual
value.
that's
why
the
term
assessment
was
used
in
the
virgin
islands
debt
limitation,
because
that
was
in
a
preexisting
federal
statute
that
required
assessment
be
an
actual
value.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
none.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
i
think
it
does
further
the
purpose
of
what
congress
was
looking
to
in
both
the
virgin
islands
and
alaska.
the
requirement
for
various
reasons
that
they
impose
their
tax
on
the
actual
value
certainly
supports
the
reasonableness
of
the
interpretation
here,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
the
actual--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
preexisting
law
in
hawaii
before
it
became
a
territory
had
tax
imposed
on
the
actual
value,
and
subsequent
to
the
debt
limitation,
the
territorial
law
also
put
it
on
actual
value.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
certainly
if
there
is
any
debate
that
there's
more
than
one
interpretation
of
the
organic
act,
that
deference
should
be
afforded
to
the
guam
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
that.
that
is
well
established
under
this
court.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
the
guamanians,
your
honor.
it
is
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--most
of
the
income
and
revenue
on
guam
comes
from
the
federal
income
tax,
because
unlike
on
the
mainland,
the
federal
income
tax
goes
to
the
guam
treasury
rather
than
the
united
states
treasury.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yeah,
other
financial
relationships
with
the
u.s.
government,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
practice.
the
encouragement
of
congress
setting
up
the
independent
judiciary
and
government
of
guam
has
also
included
fiscal
responsibility,
and
part
of
that
are
the
bond
issuance
and
the
issues
that
are
here
before
the
court.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
here
that
the
debt
limitation
is
a
matter
of
local
concern.
it
is
the
constitution
of
guam.
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
court
affirm
an
erroneous
interpretation
at
all.
this
is
a
more
than
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
theory,
well
reasoned
opinion
by
the
guam
supreme
court.
the
guam
supreme
court
has
support,
it's
17-year
old
superior
court
opinion
that
had
reached
the
same
conclusion.
that
was
the
only
law
out
there
that
guamanians
had
looked
to
for
the
interpretation
of
those
provisions
of
the
organic
act.
it
predated
the
1993
appraisal.
and
it
took
that
opinion
and
did
not
simply
adopt
it,
but
went
through
and
did
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
the
test
of
the
statute
of
the
organic
act,
the
fact
that
it
did
not
include
the
word
assessed,
which
was
used
10
months
later
by
congress
in
the
virgin
islands.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
absolutely,
your
honor.
because
of
petitioner's
delay
for
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
in
a
court
that
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
these
bonds
still
have
not
been
able
to
issue.
and
petitioner
responded
no.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
bond
market
will
not
support
issuance
of
these
bonds
until
attempts
to
undermine
their
validity
have
been
brought
to
an
end.
and
so
the
guam
government
has
been
doing
different
means
of
financing
in
a
positive
manner.
the
economy
of
guam
has
returned
because
of
many
of
the
devastating
world
events
have
taken,
have
passed
in
time,
and
the
economy
is
recovering.
the
u.s.
military
is
returning
with
a
very
large
presence
there.
but
they
are
still,
my
understanding,
approximately
two
years
behind
in
getting
back
tax
returns.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
the
guam
supreme
court
opinion
stands,
and
we
prevail
under
that
ruling,
the
guam
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
section
11
of
the
organic
act.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
is
an
island-wide
tax,
your
honor.
land
is
taxed
at
one-quarter
of
1
percent
and
improvements
are
taxed
at
1
percent.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
that
congress
intended
to
inject
itself
into
the
workings
of
this
local
territorial
tax
mechanism.
the
various
policies--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
policy
decision
that
the
local
governing
authority
makes
about
taxes.
actually
the
petitioner
has
a
footnote
explaining
the
origin
of
fractional
tax
valuation.
indeed,
it
seems
to
be
consistent
with
some
of
the
history
also
that
we've
seen
that
there
would
be
informal
adjustments
of
valuations
to
take
into
account
perhaps
poverty,
or
to
take
into
account
less
meritorious
justifications.
and
the...
because
of
the
perception
or,
i
believe
petitioner
calls
it
the
political
psychology
perhaps,
of
having
such
a
high
rate,
that
is
a
policy
decision
that
different
taxing
authorities
make.
it
should
not
mean
that
guam
surrenders
two-thirds
of
its
debt
limitation.
congress
did
not
use
the
word
assessed
and
it's
a
very
difficult
argument
to
adopt
that
by
failing
to
use
assessed,
they
limited
it
to
an
assessed
value
that
surrendered
two-thirds
of
the
guam
territorial
debt
limitation
contrary
to
all--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
and
in
the
santa
fe
case
versus
friday,
with
all
due
respect,
petitioner
is
incorrect
that
that
addressed
territorial
laws.
that
was
a
provision
in
the
new
mexico
organic
act
that
fed
up
the
jurisdiction
of
district
courts
that
congress
created
in
new
mexico.
there
was
a
provision
in
that
organic
act
provision
of
new
mexico
that
said
the
jurisdiction
of
those
courts
was
as
limited
as
law.
that
passage
was
interepreted
in
this
court
in
friday
looking
at
another
federal
statute
and
some
territorial
laws.
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
briefs
in
the
case,
that
opinion
itself
was
quite
brief,
and
when
you
look
at
the
explications
of
the
party,
it
simply
reinforces
that
the
court
there
was
construing
an
organic
act,
a
federal
statue,
and
local
territorial
statutes,
and
there
directly
said
that
they
should
defer
to
the
local
understanding
of
the
courts
unless
it
is
clearly
wrong.
so
we
urge
that
that,
too,
should
be--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
but
if
you'd
like
me
to
respond?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that
you
could
look
to
your
area
of
administrative
deference,
for
example,
under
chevron,
where
you
do
also
defer
to
the
authority
of
an
agency,
the
interpretation
of
an
agency.
the
determination
of
its
own
authority
the
court
has
upheld.
thank
you,
your
honor.
