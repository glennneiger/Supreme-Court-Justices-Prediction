just
on
the
merits,
the
first
thing
that
the
tax
authorities
have
to
do
is
they--
have
to
value
the
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
would
the
ninth
circuit
have
had
jurisdiction
after
october
30,
2004
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
guam
supreme
court
and
send
the
case
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
did
that.
"we
don't
have
jurisdiction
but
we
are
nevertheless
going
to
enter
the
following
order,
which
presumably
depends
on
our
having
jurisdiction,
that
the
judgment
is
vacated.
"
assuming
it's
bad.
you
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit
could
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
how
much
time
did
the
petitioners
have
after
the
statute
passed?
90
days?
or
the
interval
of
90
days
minus
whatever
had
been
run?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
be
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
miss
brinkmann,
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
is
there
any
history
of
the
federal
government
having
to
bail
out
the
guam
government
for
bankruptcy
or
anything
close
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
what
kind
of
a
credit
rating
guam
has?
