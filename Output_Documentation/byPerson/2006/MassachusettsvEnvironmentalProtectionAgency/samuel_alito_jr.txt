alito,

if
you
look
ahead,
i
don't
know
how
far
imminence
allows
you
to
look
ahead,
but
let's
say
we're
looking
at
5
years
or
10
years,
what
particularized
harm
does
the
record
show
that
massachusetts
will,
or
faces
an
imminent
threat
of
suffering,
that
can
be
traceable
to
the
reductions
that
you
want
to
produce
through
these
regulations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
6
percent
is
the
total
emissions,
the
total
contribution
from
motor
vehicles
in
the
united
states,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
the
global.
and
so,
the
reduction
that
you
could
achieve
under
the
best
of
circumstances
with
these
regulations
would
be
a
small
portion
of
that,
would
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
epa
concludes
that
regulating
an
air
pollutant
would
endanger
public
health
and
welfare,
can
it
decline
to
regulate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
has
to
regulate
even
if
it
concludes
that
regulation
would
make
things
worse?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
can't
they...
what
is
wrong
with
their
view
that
for
the
united
states
to
proceed
unilaterally
would
make
things
worse
and
therefore
they're
going
to
decline
to
regular
for
that
reason?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
definition
of
public
welfare
extremely
broad?
