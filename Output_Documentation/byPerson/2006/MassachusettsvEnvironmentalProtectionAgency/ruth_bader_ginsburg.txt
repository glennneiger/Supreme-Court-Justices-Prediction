but
whatever
position
holds
for
motor
vehicles
would
similarly
hold
for
power
plants,
and
has
there
been
any
application
to
epa
with
respect
to
carbon
dioxide
in
power
plants?
justice

bader

mr.
milkey,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
you're
not
representing
a
group
of
law
students,
but
a
number
of
states
who
are
claiming
that
they
are
disarmed
from
regulating
and
that
the
regulatory
responsibility
has
been
given
to
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
isn't
exercising
it?
i
thought
you
had
a
discrete
claim
based
on
the
sovereignty
of
states
and
their
inability
to
regulate
dependent
on
the
law
congress
passed
that
gives
that
authority
to
the
epa.
i
thought
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you
are
right
and
then
it
went
back
and
the
epa
then
said,
well,
an
obvious
reason
also
is
constraint
on
our
own
resources,
we
have
the
authority
to
say
what
comes
first,
congress...
we
couldn't
possibly
do
everything
that
congress
has
authorized
us
to
do;
so
it's
our
decision,
even
though
we
have
the
authority
to
do
this,
we
think
that
we
should
spend
our
resources
on
other
things.
suppose
they
said
that?
you
said
they
didn't
say
it
this
time
around,
but
how
far
will
you
get
if
all
that's
going
to
happen
is
it
goes
back
and
then
epa
says
our
resources
are
constrained
and
we're
not
going
to
spend
the
money?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
garre,
doesn't
the
epa's
decision
on
the
first,
"we
don't
have
any
authority",
doesn't
that
infect
its
subsequent
decision,
"well,
even
if
we
did,
we
wouldn't
exercise
it.
"
but
they've
already
decided
they
don't
have
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
take
it
that
on
that
question,
is
there
authority,
the
epa
has
come
out
one
way,
but
at
least
it
is
debatable
because
as
you
just
said,
the
predecessors
of
the
current
people
said
we
do
have
the
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
why
there's
a
significant
difference
between
the
agency
saying
that
for
60
years,
and
i
think
this
court
stressed
that
in
its
opinion,
and
congress
reacting
to
that,
what
the
agency's
position
was.
and
here
where
it's
a
newly
minted
position,
because
the
agency's
position
not
too
long
ago
was
that
they
did
have
the
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
different
question.
i'm
just
focusing
on,
did
it
have
authority
to
deal
with
this
issue?
