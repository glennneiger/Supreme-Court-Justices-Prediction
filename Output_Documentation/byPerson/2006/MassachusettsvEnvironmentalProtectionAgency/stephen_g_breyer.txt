justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
this
particular
issue,
the
opinion
as
i
read
it,
of
the
epa,
consists
of
32
pages.
twenty
of
those
pages,
22
in
fact,
deal
with
whether
they
have
statutory
authority.
and
of
the
10
that
deal
with
the
issue
we're
talking
about
now,
five
of
them
give
as
their
reason
that
they
think
that
the
president
has
a
different
policy.
of
the
remaining
five,
two
more
consider
international
aspects
of
the
problem
and
how
you
have
to
get
other
countries
to
cooperate;
and
then
the
conclusion
of
that
part
says
in
light
of
these
considerations,
we
decide
not
to
exercise
our
power.
now
their
claim
with
respect
to
that,
is
that
at
least
three
of
the
four
considerations
are
not
proper
things
for
the
agency
to
take
into
account:
namely
whether
the
president
wants
to
do
something
different,
whether
we're
running
foreign
policy
properly,
whether
cooperation
with
other
countries
are
relevant
to
this
particular
issue.
so
what
they've
asked
us
to
do
is
send
it
back
so
they
can
get
the
right
reasons.
now...
if
they
want
not
to
do
it.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
it
depended
on
that
is
whether
or
not
these
other,
improper
considerations
might
have
influenced
the
ultimate
decision
not
to
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
i
write
an
opinion...
when
i
write
an
opinion,
sometimes
i
write
the
words:
"we
decide
this
matter
in
light
of
the
following
three
factors
taken
together.
"
and
i
guess
a
lawyer
who
said,
"one
of
those
factors
alone
the
court
has
held
justified
the
result
all
by
itself.
"
--in
saying
the
court
has
held
that,
i
guess
that
wouldn't
be
so.
that
would
be
a
bad
lawyer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
write
that
all
of
these
considerations
justify
our
result,
again,
one
of
them
by
themselves,
it
sounds,
they
think
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
is
not
greenhouse
gas.
suppose
it
was
agent
orange.
suppose
there
a
car
is
coming
down
the
street
and
it
sprays
out
agent
orange.
and
i
come
into
the
court
and
i
say,
you
know,
i
think
that
agent
orange
is
going
to
kill
me
with
cancer.
and
the
reply
is,
well,
we
have
some
scientists
here
who
say
your
chance
of
dying
of
cancer
from
agent
orange
is
only
1
in
30.
maybe
1
in
50.
maybe
1
in
a
thousand.
maybe
1
in
10,000.
and
therefore,
you
have
no
standing
to
require
the
epa
to
regulate
this
pollutant,
agent
orange,
which
is
in
a
green
cloud
all
over
the
city.
now,
would
you
say
that
the
person
who's
made
that
claim
has
no
standing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
only
addressing,
using
that
to...
to
address
your
problem
that
the
chances
are
too
small
that,
in
fact,
any
one
individual
will
be
affected
by
the
7
percent
or
6
percent
of
the
material
that
comes
out
of
the
truck...
the
co2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
others
cooperate?
suppose,
for
example,
they
regulate
this
and
before
you
know
it,
they
start
to
sequester
carbon
with
the
power
plants,
and
before
you
know
it,
they
decide
ethanol
might
be
a
good
idea,
and
before
you
know
it,
they
decide
any
one
of
15
things,
each
of
which
has
an
impact,
and
lo
and
behold,
cape
cod
is
saved.
now
why
is
it
unreasonable?
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
go
to
an
agency
and
say
now
you
do
your
part,
which
is
6
percent,
and
now
we're
going
to
go
to
a
different
agency
like
nhtsa
and
we're
going
to
ask
them
too,
and
we're
going
to
go
to
your
electricity
regulation
program,
and
coal.
and
there
are
like
not
a
million
things
that
have
to
be
done,
maybe
there
are
only
seven.
but
by
the
time
we
get
those
seven
things
done,
we'll
make
a
big
difference.
now
what
is
it
in
the
law
that
says
that
somehow
a
person
cannot
go
to
an
agency
and
say
we
want
you
to
do
your
part?
would
you
be
up
here
saying
the
same
thing
if
we're
trying
to
regulate
child
pornography,
and
it
turns
out
that
anyone
with
a
computer
can
get
pornography
elsewhere?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
couldn't
have
gone
in
and
asked
for
ozone
regulations,
because
that
requires
other
countries?
or
what
about
dumping
heavy
metals
in
the
sea,
and
as
the
sea
gets
polluted
because
of
what
other
countries
do,
but
epa
tried
to
regulate
that.
acid
rain
they
tried
to
regulate.
you're
saying
there
is
no
standing
to
ask
for
any
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
are
saying
if
congress
passes
a
statute
and
they
put
the
words
co2
right
in
this
statute
under
ambient
air,
and
they
say
anybody
can
go
and
sue
if
the
epa
doesn't
do
it,
you're
saying
congress
lacks
the
constitutional
authority
to
do
that,
because
it's
article
iii
we're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
you
to
address
that.
you
said
there
was
a
lot
of
legislation
in
congress
that
would
have
been
pretty
inconsistent
with
serious
regulation
by
the
fda.
and
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
congress
is
opposing
the
notion.
i
don't
know
anybody
there
who's
in
favor
of
global
warming.
and
it
seems
to
me
they
haven't
passed
laws
that
is
actually,
that
would
be
significantly
interfered
with
by
the
epa
trying
to
do
its
best
to
deal
with
this
problem.
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
articles
would
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
prevents
them
from
consulting
with
other
nations
or
prevents
the
government
from
doing
that
when
they
determine
how
best
to
work
out
whatever
standards
or
other
forms
of
regulation
they
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
they
have
a
good
reason,
yes
or
no?
because
i'm
not
an
expert
in
foreign
affairs.
the
epa
probably
is
more
than
i
am.
but
do
you
think
that
if
they
do
rest
their
decision
on
their
analysis
of
foreign
affairs,
that
that
is
a
proper
basis
for
an
agency
like
the
epa
to
refuse
to
regulate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
scalia?
because
i
thought
you
said
before
that
you
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
us
to
send
this
case
back
so
that
they
could
redetermine
in
light
of
proper
considerations
whether
they
wanted
to
exercise
their
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
wrong
about
that?
