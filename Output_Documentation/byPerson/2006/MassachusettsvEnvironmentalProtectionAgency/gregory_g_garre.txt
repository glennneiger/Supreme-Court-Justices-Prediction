mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
after
carefully
considering
the
issue
the
nation's
expert
agency
in
environmental
matters
concluded
that
congress
has
not
authorized
it
to
embark
on
the
regulation
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
address
global
climate
change.
and
that
even
if
it
has,
now
is
not
the
time
to
exercise
such
authority,
in
light
of
the
substantial
scientific
uncertainty
surrounding
global
climate
change
and
the
ongoing
studies
designed
to
address
those
uncertainties.
plaintiffs
have
provide
no
reason
to
override
that
quintessential
administrative
judgment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
in
the
sense,
i
think
epa
made
clear
in
its
decisional
document
that
it
considered
as
an
alternative
matter,
that
if
it,
even
assuming
it
did
have
the
authority,
that
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
to
exercise
it
at
this
time.
and
importantly,
too,
i
mean,
just
to
be
clear
on
this,
epa
has
never
made
an
endangerment
finding
with
respect
to
global
climate
change.
that
was
true
in
1998
and
1999
when
the
agency
had
a
different
position
on
authority
to
regulate.
even
then
the
agency's
position
was
clear.
even
assuming
we
have
the
authority,
now
is
not
the
time
to
exercise
it.
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
to
that
degree,
your
honor,
this
court
has
made
clear,
for
example,
in
the
brand
x
case
that
even
where
agencies
change
positions,
where
they've
provided
reasonable
grounds
for
a
new
interpretation,
that
interpretation
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
we
think
that
that
is
true
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
that
it
depends
on
how
many
pages
that
the
agency
devoted
to
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it
depends
on
the
reasons
that
the
agency
gave.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
agency
gave
was
the
substantial
scientific
uncertainty
surrounding
the
issue
of
global
climate
change.
petitioners
acknowledge
that
that
was
an
appropriate
consideration
for
the
agency.
so
even
if
you
think
the
other
considerations
were
inappropriate,
and
we
certainly
do
not,
but
even
if
you
think
they
are,
the
agency
gave
an
appropriate
reason.
and
that
reasons--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i...
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
epa
decisional
document,
your
honor.
certainly,
the
agency
didn't
go
out
of
its
way
to
say,
"and
reading
these
considerations
together
and
not
any
of
them
individually.
"
and
with
respect
to
the
scientific
uncertainty,
your
honor,
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
that
the
epa
had
before
it
and
pointed
to
the
report
of
the
national
research
council
on
global
climate
change.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
if
you
are
referring
to
the
amicus
brief,
your
honor,
there
are...
assuming
there
are
amicus
briefs
on
the
other
side.
the
ballunas
amicus
brief...
i
think
it
is
fair
for
the
court
to
look
at,
to
look
at
the
document
that
the
agency
had
before
it.
that...
that
document
produced
by
the
national
research...
research
council,
that's
the
research
arm
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences.
and
it's
one
of
the
gold
standards
of
research.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
i
think
one
thing
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
agree
on
is
there
is
that
there
is
uncertainty
surrounding
the
phenomenon
of
global
climate
change.
i
think
the
debate
is
on
which
areas
are
more
uncertain
than
the
others.
but
certainly
i
think
the
agency
was
entitled
to
conclude,
particularly
if
you
take
into
account
the
deference
this
court
should
give
to
that
kind
of
determination,
that
the
scientific
uncertainty
surrounding
the
issue
of
global
climate
change,
surrounding
issues
of
the
extent
of
natural
variability
in
climate,
surrounding
the
issues
of
impact
of
climate
feedbacks
like
ocean
circulation,
and
low
cloud
cover,
are
permissible
considerations
for
the
agency
to
take
into--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
the
report
says
that
it
is
likely
that
there
is
a...
a
connection,
but
that
it
cannot
unequivocally
be
established.
i
think
that...
if
i
could
use
that
to
go
back
to
the
standing
question,
your
honor,
which
is
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
they've
showed
not
just
a
connection
between
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
toto
and
the
phenomenon
of
global
climate
change,
but
the
particular
class
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
at
issue
in
this
case.
six
percent
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
at
most.
that
assumes
you
put
all
u.s.
vehicles
off
the
road
or
that
they
are
all
zero
emission
cars.
so
you're
talking
about
emissions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
what
petitioners
here
to
show,
they
bear
the
burden
in
order
to
establish
standing
under
this
case,
is
that
regulation
of
the
class
of
greenhouse
gases
at
issue
in
this
case
will
make
a
difference
to
them.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
a
fundamentally
different
case,
for
the
simple
reason
that
global
climate
change
is
a
global
phenomenon.
i
mean
one--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the...
the
individual
in
that
case,
your
honor,
like
the
plaintiffs
here,
would
have
to
show
specific
facts
demonstrating
injury,
redressibility
and
traceability.
now
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
this
court's
standing
cases
make
clear
that
you
have
to
show
that
granting
the
relief
requested
is
likely
to
redress
the
alleged
harms.
and
again,
looking
at
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't...
we're
not
saying
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we're
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
they
have,
they
certainly
have
to
do
more
than
they
have
done
here.
and
they're
granted
their
standing--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
will
be
more
specific.
and
if
i
could
also
just
point
to
what
they
grounded
their
case
on
here.
they
grounded
their
case
on
here,
in
the
declarations,
on
the
notion
if
the
united
states
regulates
greenhouse
gas
emissions
of
vehicles,
then
other
countries
will
follow
suit
with
respect
to
the
emissions
of
vehicles
and
other
greenhouse
gas
emissions.
that's
clear
from
the
mccracken
declaration
on
page
239,
paragraph
32
of
the
ja,
as
well
as
the
walsh
declaration.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
still
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
basis
that
they've
relied
upon
on
standing.
and
they
haven't
shown
specific
facts
which
should
provide
any
comfort
to
this
court
that
regulation
of
less
than
6
percent
or
fewer
greenhouse
emissions
worldwide
will
have
any
effect
on
their
alleged
injuries.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
souter,
one
fundamental
reason
is
that
we
don't
know
what
the
rest
of
the
world
is
going
to
do,
whether
or
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
souter,
their
burden
is
to
show
that
if
the
court
grants
their
requested
relief
it
will
redress
their
injuries.
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that's
fine,
justice
souter,
i
grant
you
that.
but
they
still
have
to
show
that
there
is
reason
that
it
is
likely
to
believe,
that
the
reduction
in
that
tiny
fraction
of
united
states
emissions,
putting
aside
the
99
percent
or
the
95
percent
in
the
rest
of
the
world
and
what
they
do,
and
the
evidence
that
shows
that
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
those
countries
are
increasing,
they
have
to
show
the
regulation
of
that
tiny
fraction
would
have
an
affect
on
their
alleged
injuries,
not
to
completely
redress
them,
your
honor.
we
don't
say
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
have
to
show
that
it
is
likely,
your
honor.
and
they
haven't
even
tried
to
make
that
showing.
the
one
thing
that
they've--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
that
it
is
fair,
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
pretend
to
be
an
expert
on
global
climate
change.
but
the
one
thing
i
can
say
is
from
the
materials
i
looked
at
is
that
this
an
extraordinarily
complex
area
of
science.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
studies
available
that
would
suggest
that
the
regulation
of
that
minuscule
fraction
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
would
have
any
effect
whatsoever
on
the
global--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
what
i
would
point
you
to
is
your
decision
in
lujan
versus
defenders
of
wildlife,
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
asarco
versus
kadish,
where
the
court
made
clear
that
you
cannot
establish
standing
based
on
predictions
of
the
actions
of
independent
actors
not
before
it.
that's
true
about
other
agencies
that
aren't
here
today.
that's
true
about
other
countries
whom
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
congress
has
specifically
addressed
two
of
the
areas
that
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
and
we're
not
saying
that
categorically--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
we're
saying
two
things.
first,
every
plaintiff
has
the
obligation
to
establish
that
he
has
article
iii
standing
under
this
constitution.
and
secondly,
there
are
members
of
this
court,
for
example,
justice
kennedy
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
defenders
of
wildlife,
who
did
suggest
that
perhaps
if
congress
specifically
addresses
an
issue,
that
could
inform
the
standing
analysis.
for
example--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
cannot,
your
honor.
congress
could
make
findings
with
respect
to
causation
or
other
issues
that
this
court
would
have
to
give
deference
to
and
seriously
consider,
but
you're
right.
it
would
not
override
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
and
there
may
be
some
global
phenomenon
that
create
more
difficult
challenges
to
establish
standing
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
true,
your
honor,
moving
to
the
merits,
that's
true.
and
with
respect
to
that,
the
agency
engaged
in
the
same
type
of
analysis
that
this
court
laid
out
in
the
brown
and
williamson
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
agencies
have
inherent
discretion
to
determine
when
to
make
that
judgment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
gets
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is,
what
judicial
review
is
available.
we
have
assumed
in
this
case
that
there's
some
measure
of
judicial
review.
so
i
think
at
some
point
you
got
to
the
point
where
the
agency
either
has
provided
no
reasons
whatsoever,
or
there
is
no
sound
basis
for
the
agency
not
to
take
that
step.
then
assuming
that
there
is
a
role
for
the
courts
here,
a
court
could
come
in
and
say
that
that
was
inappropriate.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
again,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
question...
we
think
the
statute
does
not
put
a
deadline
on
when
the
agency
has
to
have,
and
that
therefore--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
not
the
agency's
interpretation.
in
fact
in
its
decisional
document
under
the
section
no
mandatory
duty,
the
agency
explains
why
that's
not
its
interpretation
and
we
think
that
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation.
congress
knows
how
to
constrain
the
exercise
of
discretion.
we
point
in
footnotes
18
and
19
of
our
brief
of
many
examples
where
congress
has
laid
out
deadlines
or
other
constraints
on
the
exercise
of
discretion,
and
those
aren't
present
in
section
203.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
and
then
i
think
it's
a
point
the
d.c.
circuit
made
in
the
ethyl
corporation
case
at
footnote
37,
that
precisely
because
the
statute
imposes
a
duty
to
act
once
that
endangerment
finding
is
made,
the
agency
has
discretion
to
determine
when
to
make
the
endangerment
finding.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
a
separate
sort
of
action,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
where
people
have
said
that
this
is
unreasonable
delay.
that's
not
the
claim
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
brought.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
under
the
statute--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
was
assuming...
in
answering
justice
stevens'
questions,
that
we
were
down
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
part.
but
you're
right,
your
honor,
the
threshold
position
of
the
agency
on
this
is
that
it
lacks
the
authority
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
the
way
that
the
agency
looked
at
this
is
to
look
at
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
it
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
address
global
climate
change,
and
it
looked
to
the
factors
that
this
court
laid
out
in
brown
and
williamson.
the
statute
as
a
whole
is
specific
legislation
addressing
global
climate
change,
and
it
concluded
that
the
agency
had
not
authorized
it
to
embark
on
that
regulatory--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
the
agency...
what
the
agency
found,
your
honor,
was
that
because
global
climate
change
is
not
air
pollution
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute...
which
is
to
say
that
congress
did
not
authorize
it
to
regulate
it
as
air
pollution.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
key
to
the
agency
was
that
congress
did
not
give
it
regulatory
authority
over
this.
and
i
think
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
greenhouse
gas
emissions
qualify--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
agency
pointed
to
the
term
"air
pollution
agent"
in
the
statute,
and
concluded
that
because
global
climate
change
was
not
air
pollution
that
congress
intended
to
address--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
with
respect
to
acid
rain,
it's
a
good
example
insofar
as
congress
has
enacted
a
whole
separate
title
of
the
clean
air
act
to
address
acid
rain.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
mention
on
the
interpretive
question
is,
in
the
brown
and
williamson
case,
this
court
assumed
at
the
outset
of
its
analysis
that
nicotine
would
be
within
the
general
terms
of
the
definition
of
drug
in
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
and
that
cigarettes
would
fall
within
the
general
term
of
drug--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it's
largely
the
position
that
the
agency
took,
your
honor,
insofar
as
it
reasoned
that,
look,
we've
looked
at
everything.
we
conclude
that
congress
doesn't
intend
us
to
regulate
global
climate
change
as
air
pollution.
and
so
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
say
that
greenhouse
gases
are
air
pollution
agents.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
30
years
before
the
agency
reached
the
conclusion
in
1998
that
carbon
dioxide
was
an
air
pollutant.
and
again,
even
when
it
reached
that
conclusion,
it
made
clear
that
it
didn't
think
that
the
agency
would
exercise
its
authority
to
regulate
it.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
i
think...
i
mean,
i
grant
you
that
there
are
differences
between
brown
and
williamson
and
this
case,
but
the
fundamental
conclusion
that
the
agency
reached
is
the
same.
which
was,
to
borrow
the
phrase
from
the
whitman
case,
congress
did
not
intend
to
hide
elephants
in
mouse
holes.
here
we
are
talking
about
an
issue
of
the
magnitude
of
regulating
global
climate
change
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
which
are
fundamentally
an
important
part
of
the
nation's
economy.
nearly
85
percent
of
the
economy
is
a
direct
or
indirect
source
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions.
and
when
we
look
at
when
congress
did
mention
carbon
dioxide
in
the
statute,
which
is
in
the
1990
amendments,
section
103(g),
that
was
the
first
time
that
congress
mentioned
co2.
and
when
it
did
that,
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
it
was
giving
non-regulatory
authority
to
the
agency,
and
moreover,
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
provide
any
basis
for
any
air
pollution
control
requirements.
that's
a
strange
thing
for
congress
to
say
if
it
believed
that
the
agency
already
had
this
far-reaching
authority
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions.
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
statute
that
we
think
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
in
brown
&
williamson.
there's
a
fundamental
inconsistency,
the
agency
concluded,
between
attempting
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
under
the
national
air
ambient
quality
system,
and
that
inconsistency
is
similar
to
the
inconsistency
that
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
brown
and
williamson
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
you're
wrong
in
the
following
respect,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
congress
has
passed
at
least
six
separate
statutes
to
specifically
address
the
issue
of
global
warming,
and
all
of
them
share
two
common
features.
one,
we
want
you
to
research
this
issue
and
learn
more
about
it.
and
two,
we
want
you
to
work
on
an
international
framework
for
addressing
global
climate
change.
the
agency
reasonably
concluded
that
unilateral--
u.s.
regulation
of
greenhouse
gases--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there's
nothing
in
the
clean
air
act,
if
that's
the
stature
you're
referring
to,
but
i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
right,
your
honor.
we've
got
a
unique
collective
action
problem,
and
yet,
the
reaction
experience
of
the
agency
in
dealing
with
the
issue
of
stratospheric
ozone
depletion
rate
had
precisely
that
situation,
where
the
u.s.
initially
took
steps.
the
stratospheric
ozone
depletion
worsened,
and
it
was
only
after
international
agreement
was
reached
in
the
montreal
protocol
that
a
global
solution
to
the
problem
was
reached.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
it's
a
proper
basis
within
its
inherent
discretion,
your
honor,
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one,
the
agency
is
a
part
of
the
executive
branch
and
it
had
unique
experience
with
the
issue
of
stratospheric
ozone
depletion.
and
two,
congress
has
made
clear,
for
example
in
the
global
climate
protection
act
of
1987,
that
the
epa
has
a
role
in
at
least
reporting
to
congress
on
international
cooperation
and
efforts
in
that
realm.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
in
looking
at
all
the
sources
the
agency
looked
to,
the
conclusion
is,
that
the
agency
responsibly
and
prudently
reached,
is
that
congress
has
not
authorized
it
to
embark
on
this
regulatory
endeavor.
and
i
think
the
closest
statute
that
comes
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--may
i
answer
the
question?
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
agency's
conclusion
was
congress
had
not
authorized
it
to
undertake
the
regulation
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
address
global
climate
change
and
that,
even
if
it
had,
that
authority
should
not
be
exercised.
thank
you
very
much.
