mr.
james
r.
milkey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
frame
the
merits
very
quickly
and
then
turn
immediately
to
standing.
although
the
case
before
you
arises
in
an
important
policy
area,
it
turns
on
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
and
administrative
law.
epa
made
a
decision
based
on
two
grounds,
both
of
which
constitute
plain
errors
of
law
reviewable
under
any
standard.
epa's
principle
grounds
was
that
it
lacked
authority
over
the
emissions
of
the
four
substances
at
issue,
even
if
they,
in
fact,
endanger
public
health
and
welfare.
that
legal
conclusion
fails
as
a
matter
of
law.
as
a
fallback
position,
epa
declined
to
consider
if
these
substances
are
endangering
public
health
and
welfare,
claiming
its
policy
approach
made
more
sense
than
the
regulatory
scheme
encompassed
in
section
1202
of
the
clean
air
act.
although
epa
possesses
a
good
deal
of
discretion
in
applying
the
statutory
endangerment
test,
it
cannot
rest
its
ruling
on
impermissible
grounds
as
it
did
here.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
pass
judgment
on
the
science
of
climate
change
or
to
order
epa
to
set
emission
standards.
we
simply
want
epa
to
visit
the
rulemaking
petition
based
upon
permissible
considerations.
and
now,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
standing.
petitioner
showed
a
wide
variety
of
injury
in
fact,
all
of
which
are
the
kinds
of
harms
the
statute
was
aimed
at
preventing.
for
example,
our
uncontested
affidavits
establish
that
as
a
matter
of
physics,
the
more
greenhouse
gases
accumulate
in
the
air,
the
more
temperatures
are
going
to
rise,
ocean
waters
expand,
and
the
seas
rise.
and
of
course
as
the
seas
expand,
they
rise
everywhere
around
the
world.
some
areas
such
as
massachusetts
will
be
hit
particularly
hard
because
we're
also
subject
to
a
land
subsidence,
but
that--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--it
is,
your
honor.
we
have
shown
that
the
sea
levels
are
already
occurring
from
the
current
amounts
of
greenhouse
gases
in
the
air,
and
that
means
it
is
only
going
to
get
worse
as
the--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
it's
not
so
much
a
cataclysm
as
ongoing
harm.
the
harm
does
not
suddenly
spring
up
in
the
year
2100,
it
plays
out
continuously
over
time.
and
even
to
the
extent
you
focus
on
harms
that
occur
in
the
future,
there's
nothing
conjectural
about
that.
once
these
gases
are
emitted
into
the
area,
and
they
stay
a
long
time,
the
laws
of
physics
take
over.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
it's
actually
about
6
percent,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
but
it's
important
to
point
out
as
well,
though,
that
in
the
ruling
we
challenge,
epa
has
disavowed
authority
over
all
u.s.
sources
of
emissions,
which
constitute
about
20
percent
of
global--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--agreed,
your
honor.
but
my
point
was
that
they
disclaimed
authority
over
all
sources
of
carbon--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--it
would
take
a
few
years,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
basic
premise
of
the
clean
air
act
that
vehicle
fleets
regularly
turn
over--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
we
have
shown
in
the
record
that
a
40
percent
reduction
in
carbon
dioxide
from
cars
is
currently
feasible.
and
since
those
emissions
account
for--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--no,
no.
we
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
there
has,
your
honor.
in
fact,
epa
has
turned
down
a
rulemaking
petition
to
regulate
them
under
the
new
source
performance
standard
section
of
the
clean
air
act,
and
that
is
currently
on
appeal
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
but
it
is
currently
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
it
just--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
actually
more
direct
in
the
sense
that
in
the
decision
we
challenge
here,
they
said
greenhouse
gases
are
not
air
pollutants
under
any
regulatory
provision
of
the
act.
so
at
least
on--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--i
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
because
we
cannot
win
that
other
case
unless
we
win
this
case
here
in
terms
of
the
authority
question.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
because
of
the
scale
of
the
problem,
relatively
small
percentage
deductions
in
global
emissions
can
lead
to
real
world
results.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
especially
in
this
case
where
none
of
our
affidavits
were
challenged,
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
there
ultimately
on
the
merits
because
we
showed
through
our
uncontested
affidavits
that
these
harms
will
occur.
there
was
no
evidence
put
in
to
the
contrary,
and
i
would
add
that
the
reports
on
which
epa
itself
relies
conclude
that
climate
change
is
occurring
in--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
although
we
believe
we
have
shown
other
governments
will
follow
suit,
we
are
not
in
any
sense
relying
on
that.
we
can
easily
show
our
standing
without
relying
on
that.
and
that's
because--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--it
would
be
the
same
argument.
and
i
would
add
that
epa
in
other
contexts
has
determined
on
several
occasions
that
a
1
percent
contribution
is
significant
under
the
clean
air
act.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
it
is
different
because
here
there
is
particularized
injury
that
we
have
shown.
the
injury
doesn't
get
any
more
particular
than
states
losing
200
miles
of
coastline,
both
sovereign
territory
and
property
we
actually
own,
to
rising
seas.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
well,
your
honor,
if
i
can
deal
with
the
traceability
part
of
that
question
first,
traceability
is
easy
to
show
here
because
the
extent
of
our
harm
is
caused
by
the
overall
amount
of
the
gases
in
the
air.
and
being
focused
on
the
20
percent
of
all--
u.s.
sources,
or
the
6
percent
of
the
cars,
that's
still
a
sizeable
portion
of
the
problem,
so
we
know
that
6
or
20
percent
is
there.
in
terms
of
the
particular
harms,
similarly
we
have
shown--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--to
the
global
carbon
dioxide
emission.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
it
would
be,
we
have
shown
in
the
record
it
would
be
about
a
two-and-a-half
percent
over
the
time
it
takes
to
turn
the
fleet
over.
but
it's
important
that
given
the
nature
of
the
harms,
even
small
reductions
can
be
significant.
for
example,
if
we're
able
to
save
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
that
massachusetts
parks
agencies
are
projected
to
lose,
that
reduction
is
itself
significant.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
yes,
your
honor.
but
reducing
domestic
emissions
will
reduce
our
harm,
the
harm
we
would
otherwise
face
regardless
of
what--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
we
would
still
lose
coastline
but
we
would
not
lose
as
much
because
these
harms
are
cumulative,
and
while
reducing
u.s.
emissions
will
not
eliminate
all
the
harm
we
face,
it
can
reduce
the
harm
that
these
emissions
are
causing.
so
it
will
necessarily
reduce
our
harm
and
satisfy
redressibility.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
established
it's
necessarily
a
straight
line.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
small
vertical
rises
cause
a
large
loss
of
horizontal
land.
for
example,
where
the
slope
is
less
than
2
percent,
which
is
true
of
much
of
the
massachusetts
coastline,
every
foot
rise
will
create
a
loss
of
more
than
50
feet
of
horizontal
land.
and
for
example,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
oppenheimer
affidavit
projects
that
new
york
could
well
lose
thousands
of
acres
of
its
sovereign
territory
by
the
year
2020.
so
the
harm
is
already
occurring.
it
is
ongoing
and
it
will
happen
well
into
the
future.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
to
that
is
our
standing
here
is
so
much
more
direct
and
particularized
than,
for
example,
the
harm
this
court
found
sufficient
in
laidlaw,
which
was--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
here
i
think
the
fact
that
the
states
are
showing
harm
not
only
to
them
in
a
property
sense,
but
in
their
sovereign
capacity--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
we
agree
that
a
large
landowner
would
himself
or
herself
have--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--yes--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
do
think
we
have
special
standing.
for
example,
here
it's
uncontested
that
greenhouse
gases
are
going
to
make
ozone
problems
worse,
which
makes
it
harder
for
us
to
comply
with
our
existing
clean
air
act
responsibilities.
and
the...
in
the
west
virginia
case,
which
is
a
d.c.
circuit
case,
the
court
found
that
that
itself
provided
an
independent
source
of
standing.
in
terms
of
supreme
court
cases,
the...
it's
been...
for
200
years,
this
court
has
recognized
loss
of
state
sovereign
property
as
a
traditional--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
i
think
if
someone
is
losing
property
because
of
this
problem,
then
that
person
would
have
standing,
but
we're
nowhere
near
a
de
minimis
threshold
here.
we
have
shown
we
own
property,
200
miles
of
coastline
which
we're
losing,
and
we
think
the
standing
is
straightforward.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
once
these
are
emitted
the
laws
of
physics
take
over,
so
our
harm
is
imminent
in
the
sense
that
lighting
a
fuse
on
a
bomb
is
imminent
harm.
it
may
take--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
you
are
correct
that
we
are
saying
that
provides
us
also
an
independent
source
of
our
standing.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
in
short,
your
honor--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
i
would
cite
you
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
arizona
et
al.,
which
cites
several
cases,
albeit
not
in
this
court,
that
stand
for
that
principle.
your
honor,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits
quickly,
section
202(a)(1)
provides
epa
jurisdiction
over
any
air
pollutant
that
motor
vehicles
emit.
it's
not
restricted
to
certain
types
of
air
pollutants
or
to
air
pollutants
that
cause
certain
kinds
of
harm.
and
not
only
does
the
act
define
air
pollutant
with
comprehensive
breadth,
but
we
know
these
four
substances
are
air
pollutants
from
other
evidence.
for
example,
congress
itself
expressly
referred
to
carbon
dioxide
as
an
air
pollutant
in
section
103(g).
and
since
by
definition
all
air
pollutants
are
air
pollution
agents,
we
know
that
congress
understood
carbon
dioxide
to
be
an
agent
of
air
pollution.
and
if
air
pollution--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--that
is
correct,
your
honor;
but
they
have
said
that
they
have
put
off
making
a
judgment
based
on
impermissible
grounds.
while
epa's
explanation
is
difficult
even
to
follow,
one
overarching
point
shines
through
and
that
is
the
agency
does
not
agree
with
taking
a
regulatory
approach
regardless
of
how
it
might
otherwise
come
out.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
no,
your
honor.
epa
has
a
lot
of
room
to
move
based
both
on
the
endangerment
standard
itself
and
on
background
principles
of
administrative
law.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
when
they
do
not
rely
on
any
of
those
grounds,
they
do
not
rely
on
lack
of
information,
they
did
not
rely
on
background
principles
of
administrative
law.
what
though
said
here
is...
and...
that
they
did
not,
in
fact,
contest
the
seriousness
of
the
problem.
but
note,
in
two
back
to
back
sentences
on
page
a-82
of
the
third
petition
they
say:
we
must
address
the,
issue
but
we
disagree
with
the
regulatory
approach.
the
very
section
in
which
they
explained
why
they
weren't
going
to
regulate
is
entitled
"different
policy
approach".
rejecting
mandatory
motor
vehicle
regulation
as
a
bad
idea
is
simply
not
a
policy
choice
that
congress
left
to
epa.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
while
background
administrative
law
principles
provide
epa
at
least
some
room
to
move,
we
think
it's
important
that
epa
say
that.
if
they...
it's
a
very
different
opinion
if
they
say,
we
are
not
going
to
regular
here
because
we
just
don't
want
to
spend
the
resources
on
this
problem
and
we
want
to
look
elsewhere.
if
they
want
to
say
that,
they
can
say
that
and
then,
if
at
all,
there'd
be
a
narrow
arbitrary
and
capricious
challenge
on
that.
but
the
point
is
here
they
relied
on
the
impermissible
consideration
that
they
simply
disagreed
with
the
policy
behind
the
statute.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
it
is
and
it
isn't,
your
honor,
because
that
statement
will
alleges
be
true.
there
will
always
be
scientific
uncertainty.
agencies
will
always
have
an
understandable
interest
in
seeing
more
information.
they
never--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
when
epa
regulated
lead
back
in
the
ethyl
days,
as
the
court
court
itself
took
note,
there
were
huge
amounts
of
uncertainty
at
that
time.
and
epa
has
a
lot
of
discretion
in
evaluating
that,
that
uncertainty.
and
if
the
epa
determined
that
the
level
of
uncertainty
was
such
that
it
was
not
reasonable
to
anticipate
endangerment,
that
is
perfectly
appropriate.
it
would
also
be
appropriate
if
the
agency
determined
that
there
was
so
much
uncertainty
that
they
couldn't
even
form
a
judgment
on
that.
that
would
be
applying
the
endangerment
statute
at
the
same
time
it
put
off.
but
the
point
is
they
did
not
say
any
of
that.
they
instead
relied
on
impermissible
grounds.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
respectfully,
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
stratosphere.
it's
the
troposphere.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
under
the
express
words
of
the
statute...
and
this
is
302(g)...
for
something
to
be
an
air
pollutant
it
has
to
be
emitted
into
the
ambient
air
or
otherwise
entered
there.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
disagree,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
actually
requires
the
harm
to
occur
in
the
ambient
air.
in
fact,
some
of
the
harm
here
does
occur
there.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
we
are
not
saying,
first
of
all
that
global
warming
is
air
pollution,
any
more
than
we're
saying
that
asthma
is
air
pollution.
they're
both
effects.
i
would
point
you
to
the
example
of
acid
rain,
where
the
pollutant
there,
sulfur
dioxide,
the
problem
is
it
causes
its
harm
after
it
leaves
the
air,
after
it
gets
washed
out.
air
pollutants
do
not
need
to
cause
harm
in
the
ambient
air.
your
honor,
i
would
add
that
our
interpretation
satisfies
common
sense
because,
while
epa
has
plenary
authority
over
substances
that
motor
vehicles
emit,
those
substances
are
regulated
only
if
epa
determines
that
they
cause
endangerment.
by
defining
the
term
"air
pollutant"
comprehensively,
congress
has
not
prejudged
what
may
cause
endangerment,
but
it
has
allowed
other
pollutants
to
be
regulated
as
their
harms
become
appreciated.
it
is
epa's
interpretation
that
fails
the
common
sense
test.
they
have
suggested
that
the
term
"air
pollutant
agent"
creates
an
independent
test
so
important
that
it
may
prevent
some
harmful
compounds
from
being
regulated
without
providing
any
hint
of
what
the
term
means
or
how
it
applies
in
this
case.
and
they
cannot
explain
any
number
of
anomalies
such
as
the
fact
that
methane
is
already
a
regulated
air
pollutant,
yet
they
claim
they
can't
look
at
its
climate
effects.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
more
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
it
would
not
make
us
happy,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
if
i
can
address
the
global
aspect
of
the
problem,
the
fact
that
the
solution
to
the
whole
problem--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--that
is
exactly--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
we
want.
i
understood
justice
scalia
to
be
saying--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--respectfully,
your
honor,
i
think
epa
will
have
a
hard
time
saying
that
there
is
insufficient...
i
mean,
too
much
scientific
uncertainty.
the
very
sentence--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
respectfully,
your
honor,
they
did
not
say
that.
they
did
not
anywhere
say
why
the
existing
uncertainty
mattered.
to
the
contrary,
they
emphasized
the
need
to
act
in
the
face
of
current
uncertainty,
but
never
explained
why
that
principle
applies
to
a
nonregulatory
approach
but
not
to
a
regulatory
one.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
they
did
not
say
there
is
too
much
uncertainty
for
them
to
form
a
judgment,
which
is
the
key
issue.
they
said
they
preferred
more
certainty,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
endangerment
standard,
which
emphasizes
the
important
of
regulating
in
the
face
of
uncertainty,
they
have
to
at
least
explain
why
the
uncertainty
matters.
and
that
is...
what
they
did
here
is
particularly
troubling
in
the
fact
that
they
ignored
all
of
the
indications
pointing
toward
endangerment.
they
looked
at
what
we
don't
know
without
ever
looking
at
what
we
do
know.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
not
under
section
202,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
would
make
things
worse?
mr.
james
r.
milkey
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
that.
no.
no,
your
honor.
if
they
thought
there
would
be
more
endangerment
that
way
they
would
not
have
to
regulate.
mr.
james
r.
milkey
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
they
actually
said
that,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
even
hints
that
they
can
take
foreign
policy
considerations
into
account.
to
the
contrary,
the
statute
is
very
specific
in
other
sections
about
when
they're
supposed
to
look
at
foreign
emissions--
mr.
james
r.
milkey
--your
honor,
it
is
certainly
extremely
broad,
and
it
does
include
climate.
thank
you,
your
honor.
