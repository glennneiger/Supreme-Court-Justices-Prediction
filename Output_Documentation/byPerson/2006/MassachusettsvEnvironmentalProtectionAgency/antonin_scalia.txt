justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
standing
requires
imminent
harm.
if
you
haven't
been
harmed
already,
you
have
to
show
the
harm
is
imminent.
is
this
harm
imminent?
justice
antonin
scalia
when?
i
mean,
when
is
the
predicted
cataclysm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
a
lot
of
conjecture
about
whether...
i
gather
that
there's
something
of
a
consensus
on
warming,
but
not
a
consensus
on
how
much
of
that
is
attributable
to
human
activity.
and
i
gather
that...
what
is
it?
something
like
seven
percent
of
the
total
carbon
dioxide
emissions
are
attributable
to
automobiles
in
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
6
percent?
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
harm
that
you're
claiming.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
the,
you
know,
the
standing
issue
right
now.
and
if
you've
been
harmed,
you've
claimed
harm
because
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
have
standing.
that
has
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
but
on
the
standing
point,
only
new
cars
would
be
affected,
right?
so
even
the
reduction
of
the
6
percent
would
take
a
few
years,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
it
goes
to
how
imminent
the
harm
is
and
how
remediable
the
imminent
harm
is.
if,
in
fact,
the
6
percent
will
only
be
reduced
to
maybe
five
and
a
half
in
the
next
few
years,
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
in
the
first
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
ultimately,
when
all
the
cars
currently
on
the
roads
are
off
and
the
new
cars
with,
you
know,
whatever
measures
you
think
will
reduce
the
carbon
dioxide
are
on
the
road,
then
40
percent
would
be
the
figure.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
do
we
know
that
that's
a
straight
line
ratio,
that
a
reduction
of
two-and-a-half
percent
of
carbon
dioxide...
well,
two
and
a
half
overall
would
save
two-and-a-half
percent
of
your
coastline?
is
that
how
it
works?
i'm
not
a
scientist,
but
i'd
be
surprised
if
it
was
so
rigid.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
of
a
small
landowner?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
sure...
i
think
our
opinions
have
even
said
it,
but
certainly
commentators
have
often
said
it,
that
really
the
far
margin
of
our
standing
cases
has
been,
you
know,
the
famous
scrap
case,
in
which
the
allegation
was
that
the
added
pollution
from
municipal
incineration
of
municipal
waste
which
would...
which
couldn't
be
transported
by
rail
for
burial
because
the
icc
rates
were
too
high,
that
added
pollution
interfered
with
the
students'...
they
were
georgetown
law
students...
their
hiking
in
the
george
washington
forest
along
the
blue
ridge.
that
seems
to
me
a
much
more
immediate
kind
of
damage;
yet
that's
been
referred
to
as
really
the
far
margin
of
our
standing
cases.
you're
talking
not
about
their
being
affected
by
ambient
air
but
being
affected
by
a
stratospheric
effect
which
then
has
another
consequence
that
you
allege.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
you
have
standing
whenever
a
federal
law
preempts
state
action?
you
can
complain
about
the
implementation
of
that
law
because
it
has
preempted
your
state
action?
is
that
the
basis
of
standing
you're
alleging?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
case
that
has
ever
held
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
milkey,
i
had...
my
problem
is
precisely
on
the
impermissible
grounds.
to
be
sure,
carbon
dioxide
is
a
pollutant,
and
it
can
be
an
air
pollutant.
if
we
fill
this
room
with
carbon
dioxide,
it
could
be
an
air
pollutant
that
endangers
health.
but
i
always
thought
an
air
pollutant
was
something
different
from
a
stratospheric
pollutant,
and
your
claim
here
is
not
that
the
pollution
of
what
we
normally
call
"air"
is
endangering
health.
that
isn't,
that
isn't...
your
assertion
is
that
after
the
pollutant
leaves
the
air
and
goes
up
into
the
stratosphere
it
is
contributing
to
global
warming.
justice
antonin
scalia
troposphere,
whatever.
i
told
you
before
i'm
not
a
scientist.
[laughter]
that's
why
i
don't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
global
warming,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
i
agree
with
that.
it
is
when
it
comes
out
an
air
pollutant.
but
is
it
an
air
pollutant
that
endangers
health?
i
think
it
has
to
endanger
health
by
reason
of
polluting
the
air,
and
this
does
not
endanger
health
by
reason
of
polluting
the
air
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
talks
about
air
pollution
all
the
time.
that's
what
the,
that's
what
the
thing
is
about,
air
pollution.
it's
not
about
global
warming
and
it's
not
about
the
troposphere.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
hasn't
argued
that
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
said
that
6
percent
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
about
that?
i
found
persuasive
solicitor
general
garre's
point
that
in
the
acid
rain
context,
it
isn't
air
pollution
that
harms
health,
but
rather
it
is
the
effect
of
the
pollutant
after
it
leaves
the
air
and
produces
the
acid
rain.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
response?
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
concede
that
it's
an
air
pollutant
that
affects
health?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
isn't
it
air
pollution
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
although
whatever
it
is
that
causes
acid
rain
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
give
me
any
text
in
this
statute
itself.
it
isn't
the
phrase
"air
pollution"
or
any
other
phrase?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
gets
us
back
to
acid
rain.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
the
position
you're
taking,
that
it
is
within
the
general
term?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
the
problem
that
they
have
in
mind
is
that
we
have
nothing
to
give
in
international
negotiations.
if
we
have
done
everything
we
can
to
reduce
co2,
you
know,
what
deal
do
we
make
with
foreign
nations?
what
incentive
do
they
have
to
go
along
with
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
milkey,
do
you
want
us
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
epa
to
ask
them
whether
if
only
the
last
two
pages
of
their
opinion
were
given
as
a
reason
that
would
suffice?
would
that
make
you
happy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
was
asking,
yes.
and
you
think
it
will
go
back
to
them
and
they
will
say,
oh
my
goodness,
the
scientific
uncertainty
is
not
enough
by
itself?
you
really
expect
that
to
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
it
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
question
is
whether
that
alone
is
enough.
