chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
05-1120,
massachusetts
versus
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
milkey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
get
the
benefit
of
that
broader
allegation
in
establishing
your
standard?
in
other
words,
if
you've
challenged
epa's
refusal
to
apply
a
particular
level
of
greenhouse
regulation
to
a
particular
model
of
car,
can
you
say,
well,
they're
following
the
same
approach
to
a
coal
powered...
coal
fueled
power
plant,
and
so
we
get
to
establish
a
broader
injury?
or,
aren't
you
limited
to
the
specific
legal
challenge
you're
raising
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
you
have
to
show
injury
from
their
decision
here?
the
fact
that
other
people,
or
you
presumably
as
well
might
be
injured
by
their
decisions
that
you
are
not
challenging
here,
that
doesn't
help
your
standing
here,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
affidavits
talked
about
the
fact
that
if
the
government
starts
to
regulate,
the
technology
is
going
to
change,
if
the
technology
changes,
other
governments
will
adopt
it,
and
all
that,
and
that
strikes
me
as
sort
of
spitting
out
conjecture
on
conjecture,
the
sort
that
we
disapproved
of.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same
argument
if
the
automobile
emissions
were
1
percent
contributors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
consistent
with
our
taxpayer
standing
cases
where
the
argument
is
that
a
taxpayer
doesn't
have
standing
to
challenge
an
illegal
expenditure
as
a
general
matter
simply
because
his
contribution,
the
benefit
that
he's
claiming
is
so
small
and
so
widely
dispersed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
assumes
everything
else
is
going
to
remain
constant,
though,
right?
it
assumes
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
greater
contribution
of
greenhouse
gases
from
economic
development
in
china
and
other
places
that's
going
to
displace
whatever
marginal
benefit
you
get
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
if
your
harm
is
the
alleged
loss
of
coastline.
not
necessarily.
it
depends
upon
what
happens
across
the
globe
with
respect
to
greenhouse
emissions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
your
strongest
case
from
this
court
to
support
your
standing
allegation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
laidlaw
was
a
specific
citizen
suit
provision,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
doesn't
that
make
it
somewhat
analytically
distinct
from
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
moving
from
your
authority
argument
to
the
exercise
of
authority,
the
clause
202(a)(1)
requires
epa
to
prescribe
standards
which
in
their
judgment
cause
or
contribute
to
air
pollution
reasonably
anticipated
to
endanger
public
health.
and
they
say
they
haven't
made
that
judgment
yet,
so
they're
not
in
violation
of
that
statutory
command.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
the
first
day
this
law
is
passed,
there
are
a
lot
of
air
pollutants
that
come
out
of
motor
vehicles.
i
mean,
is
epa
immediately
in
violation
of
this
statute
if
they
don't
issue
emissions
regulations
for
every
one
those
air
pollutants
on
day
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
the
principle
that
they
want
to
deal
with
what
they
regard
as
the
more
serious
threats
sooner.
they
want
to
deal
with
lead
first
and
then
they
want
to
deal
with
other
stuff.
i
mean,
what
is
the...
when
did
they...
i
guess...
move
into
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
not
exercising
a
judgment
with
respect
to
a
particular
pollutant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
all
they
said.
i'm
looking
at
a-85
and
they
said
establishing
emissions
now
would
require
epa
to
make
scientific
and
technical
judgments
without
the
benefit
of
studies
that
are
being
developed
to
reduce
the
uncertainty
in
the
area.
that's
different
than
saying
they
disagree
with
the
regulatory
approach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
a
difference
between
the
scientific
status
of
the
harm
from
lead
emissions
from
vehicles
that...
when
you
have
lead
in
the
gasoline,
to
the
status,
the
status
of
scientific
knowledge
with
respect
to
the
impact
on
global
warming
today?
those
are
two
very
different
levels
of
uncertainty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
milkey.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
not
a
mathematical
question,
right?
i
mean,
you
would...
it's
that
you
would...
what
is
the
number?
what's
enough?
10
percent?
15
percent?
presumably,
there's
more
to
it
than
the
percentage
of
emissions
attributable
to
be
this
particular--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--just
because
there's
no
standing
to
challenge
an
agency's
decision
doesn't
mean
the
agency
can't
regulate
that
particular
area,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
can't
compromise
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
if
epa
made
the
judgment
under
the
statute,
you
think
they
would
have
had
the
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
had
a
brown
and
williamson
argument
that
epa
was
precluded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
milkey,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
they
said
was
until
more
is
understood
about
causes,
extent
and
significance
of
climate
change
and
the
potential
options
for
addressing
it,
we
believe
it's
inappropriate
to
regulate
these
emissions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
strikes
me
as
saying
they
think
there
is
too
much
uncertainty
for
them
to
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
05-1120,
massachusetts
v.
environmental
protection
agency,
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
which
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
