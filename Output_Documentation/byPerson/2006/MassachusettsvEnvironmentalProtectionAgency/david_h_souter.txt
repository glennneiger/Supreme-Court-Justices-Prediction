they
are
saying
it
is
likely
to
do
so,
even
though
we
cannot
give
you
a
point
for
point
percentage
correlation
between
reduction
of
gas
and
coastline
loss.
you're
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
have
somehow
got
to
pinpoint
this
mathematically--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before,
before
there
is
redressibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
me
what
it
is
that
they
need,
be
more
specific
about
what
they
need
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
there...
why
is
there
reason
to
assume
that
it
will
have
no
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
seems
to
be
the
assumption
you're
making.
you
are
saying
unless
they
can
pinpoint
the
correlation
between
reduction
of
gas
and
effect,
let's
say
in
coastline
loss,
they
have
not
shown
either
causation
or
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
redressibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
do
they
have
to
show
a
precise
correlation
as
opposed
simply
to
establishing
what
i
think
is
not
really
contested,
that
there
is
a
correlation
between
greenhouse
gases
and
the
kind
of
loss
that
they're
talking
about;
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
some
reduction
in
the
gases
will
result
in
some
reduction
in
future
loss.
why
is
that
insufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
rest...
let's
assume
that
the
rest
of
the
world
does
nothing.
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
reasonable
assumption,
but
let's
make
that
assumption.
so
that
the
only
thing
we're
talking
is
the
6
percent.
if
the
6
percent
can
be
reduced...
i
think
the
suggestion
was
over
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
by
two
and
a
half
percent
of
the
6,
there
is,
i
suppose,
reason
to
expect
that
there
will
be,
maybe
not
two
and
a
half
percent
less
coastline
lost,
but
some
degree
of
less
coastline
lost
because
there
is
a
correlation
between
the
gas
and
the
loss
of
the
coastline.
why
is
that
an
unreasonable
assumption
to
make
in
order
to
show
causation
and
redressibility,
bearing
in
mind
that
redressibility
is
a
question
of
more
or
less,
not
a
question
of
either/or.
they
don't
have
to
show
that
it
will
stop
global
warming.
their
point
is
that
will
reduce
the
degree
of
global
warming
and
likely
reduce
the
degree
of
loss,
if
it
is
only
by
two
and
a
half
percent.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
redress
their
injury
in
the
sense
that
it
will
prevent
any
global
warming
or
stop
global
warming
and
stop
coastal
erosion;
their
argument
is
a
different
one.
it
will
reduce
the
degree
of
global
warming
and
reduce
the
degree
of
coastal
loss.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
their
argument.
not
all
or
nothing.
but
a
part.
that's
what
they're
trying
to
show.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
they
have
to
show
that
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
it
will
have
an
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
showing...
and
i
agree
with,
by
the
way,
with
the
chief's
suggestion
a
moment
ago,
life
is
not,
or
physics
are
not
so
simple
as
to
assume
that
there's
going
to
be
a
be
a
direct
two
and
a
half
percent
reduction
of
coastline
for
a
two
and
a
half
percent
reduction
from
the
6
percent.
but
isn't
it
intuitively
reasonable
to
suppose
that
with
some
reduction
of
the
greenhouse
gases,
there
will
be
some
reduction
of
the
ensuing
damage
or
the
ensuing
climate
change
which
causes
the
damage?
isn't
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
have
any--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
congress
has
not
directed,
don't
regulate
domestically
for
purposes
of
global
warming.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
reference
to
this
very...
these
various
pieces
of
legislation
that
suggest
that
congress
has
a
different
modus
operandi
in
mind
is
that
congress
certainly
is
aware
that
epa
has
authority
over
pollutants,
and
it
has
never
interfered
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
a
misstatement?
isn't
the
conclusion
that
they're
trying
to
draw
that
congress
doesn't
want
them
to
exercise
the
authority
they
have
for
this
purpose?
and
isn't
that
something
quite
different?
and
doesn't
that
raise
the
question
whether
that
is
a
legitimate
concern
for
them
under
the
statute
that
does
give
them
the
authority?
