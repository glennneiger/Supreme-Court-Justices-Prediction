justice
john
paul
stevens
i
find
it
interesting
that
the
scientists
whose
worked
on
that
report
said
there
were
a
good
many
omissions
that
would
have
indicated
that
there
wasn't
nearly
the
uncertainty
that
the
agency
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
their
selective
quotations,
they
left
out
parts
that
indicated
there
was
far
less
uncertainty
than
the
agency
purported
to
find.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
uncertainty
on
the
basic
proposition
that
these
greenhouse
gases
contribute
to
global
warming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
you're
not
merely
questioning
standing
but
you
also
take
the
position
you
do
not
have
the
authority
to
do
what
the
plaintiff
asks
you
to
do;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
question,
if
we
turn
to
the
statute,
to
section
201,
there's
reference
to
"shall
regulate"
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
administrator
there
is
a
for
real
danger
and
so
forth.
in
your
view,
is
there
a
duty
to
make
a
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
have
a
discretion
never
to
make
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
didn't
really
confront
the
question,
s
i
understand
it,
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
duty
to
make
a
judgment
at
all.
and
i'm
interested
in
what
your
position
on
that
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
me,
just
reading
the
text
of
the
statute
is
a
little
ambiguous.
i'm
not
entirely
clear,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
just
reading
that
statute,
i
got
the
impression
that
congress
thought
that
the
administrator
had
a
duty
to
make
a
judgment
when
there
was
enough
evidence
out
there
that
people
were
concerned
about
it
and
so
forth,
that
there
would
be
a
duty
there,
but
you
think
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
that
if
they
did
make
a
judgment,
then
you
would
have
authority
to
regulate?
