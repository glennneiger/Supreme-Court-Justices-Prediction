but
at
the
outset,
you
made
this,
some
of
this
perhaps
reassuring
statement
that
we
need
not
decide
about
global
warming
in
this
case.
but
don't
we
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
decide
the
standing
argument,
because
there's
no
injury
if
there's
not
global
warming?
or,
can
you
show
standing
simply
because
there
is
a
likelihood
that
the
perceived
would
show
that
there's
an
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
authority
for
that?
i
have
the
same
question
as
the
chief
justice.
i
was
looking
at
your
brief
for
the
strongest
case.
suppose
there
were
a
big
landowner
that
owned
lots
of
coastline.
would
he
have
the
same
standing
that
you
do
or
do
you
have
some
special
standing
as
a
state,
and
if
so
what
is
the
case
which
would
demonstrate
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
asking
whether
you
have
some
special
standing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
a
state
and,
if
so,
what's
the
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know.
1907
was
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper,
and
that
was
pre-massachusetts
versus
mellon.
that
seems
to
me
your
best
case.
what
about
a
small
landowner?
i
asked
the
question
about
a
big
landowner.
suppose
you
have
a
small
landowner
and
he
owned
a
lot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
problem,
i
think,
you
take
the
position,
the
proposition
that
the
greater
the
harm
the
greater
the
risk,
the
smaller
the
probability
has
to
be
before
it
is
reasonable
to
act,
and
necessary
to
act.

in
norton
versus
utah
wilderness
alliance,
having
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
off-road
vehicles,
we
indicated
that
one
measure
was
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
unreasonably
delayed
its
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated
this
is
the
summary
of
an
opinion
for
the
court
by
justice
stevens.
a
group
of
states,
local
governments
and
private
organizations
petitioned
the
environmental
protection
agency,
the
epa,
to
regulate
emissions
of
four
greenhouse
gases
including
carbon
dioxide.
they
call
global
warming
the
most
pressing
environmental
challenge
of
our
time.
the
epa
administrator
concluded
that
he
lacked
authority
to
regulate
those
emissions
and
that
if
he
had
authorities
to
regulate,
he
would
not
exercise
it.
those
who
sought
regulation,
petitioned
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
concluded
the
epa
administrator
properly
exercise
his
discretion
under
section
202(a)
(1)
of
the
clean
air
act
in
denying
the
petition
for
rulemaking.
in
seeking
certiorari
here,
the
petitioners
alleged
epa
had
abdicated
its
responsibility
under
the
clean
air
act
to
regulate
the
emissions
of
four
greenhouse
gases
including
carbon
dioxide.
specifically,
the
petitioners
asked
us
to
answer
two
questions
concerning
the
meaning
of
section
202(a)(1);
first,
whether
the
epa
has
the
statutory
authority
to
regulate
green
house
gas
emissions
from
new
motor-vehicles
and
second,
if
so,
whether
it’s
stated
reasons
for
refusing
to
regulate
are
consistent
with
the
statute.
in
response,
epa,
supported
by
ten
intervening
states
and
six
trade
associations,
correctly
argued
that
we
may
not
address
those
two
questions
unless
at
least
one
petitioner
has
standing
to
invoke
our
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
denying
the
petitioners
for
a
review
and
refer
to
address
petitioners
standing.
to
insure
the
proper
adversarial
presentation,
a
litigant
must
demonstrate
that
it
has
suffered
a
concrete
and
particularized
injury
that
is
either
actual
or
imminent
that
the
injury
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
defendant
and
that
it
is
likely
that
a
favorable
decision
will
redress
that
injury.
only
one
of
the
petitioners
needs
to
have
standing
to
permit
us
to
consider
the
petition
for
review.
we
hold
today
that
petitioner’s
submission
pertaining
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
have
satisfied
the
most
demanding
standards
of
the
adversarial
process.
here
the
party’s
dispute
turns
on
the
proper
construction
of
the
congressional
statute;
a
question
eminently
suitable
to
resolution
of
federal
court.
congress
moreover
has
authorized
this
type
of
procedural
challenge
to
epa
action
or
rather
in
this
case
inaction
but
this
was
a
petition
you
recall
by
these
petitioners
to
the
epa
to
promulgate
rule.
further,
due
to
their
unique
status
in
our
federal
system,
states
are
not
normal
litigants
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
federal
jurisdiction.
as
to
massachusetts’
injury,
according
to
petitioners’
unchallenged
affidavits
global
sea
level
rouse
somewhere
10
and
20
centimeters
over
the
20th
century
as
a
result
of
global
warming.
that
rise
in
sea
levels
have
already
begun
to
swallow
massachusetts’s
coastal
land
resulting
in
an
injury
to
both
massachusetts
sovereign
interest
and
its
interest
as
landowner.
contributing
to
that
injury
is
epa’s
failure
to
regulate
greenhouse
gases
from
new
motor-vehicles.
even
leaving
aside
the
other
greenhouse
gases,
the
united
states
transportation
sector
emits
an
enormous
quantity
of
carbon
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere,
according
to
petitioners
more
than
1.7
billion
metric
tons
in
1999
alone.
that
accounts
for
more
than
6%
of
worldwide
carbon
dioxide
emissions.
judge
by
any
standard,
us
motor-vehicle
emissions
make
a
meaningful
contribution
to
greenhouse
gas
concentrations
enhance
according
to
petitioners
to
global
warming.
the
epa
regulation
to
motor-vehicle
emissions
moreover
stands
a
reasonable
probability
of
redressing
massachusetts’s
injury,
while
it
maybe
true
that
regulating
motor-vehicle
emissions
will
not
by
itself
reverse
global
warming,
if
by
no
means
follows
that
we
lack
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
epa
has
a
jury
to
take
steps
to
slow
or
to
reduce
it.
on
the
merits
of
contrary
to
epa’s
position,
we
hold
that
the
clean
air
act’s
sweeping
definition
of
air
pollutant
unambiguously
covers
greenhouse
gases.
the
definition
states
that
an
air
pollutant
is,
“any
air
pollution
agent
or
combination
of
such
agents
including
any
physical,
chemical
substance
or
matter
which
is
emitted
into
or
otherwise
enters
the
ambient
air.”
so,
on
its
face
the
definition
embraces
all
airborne
compounds
of
whatever
stripe
and
underscores
that
intents
through
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
“any”.
carbon
dioxide,
methane,
nitrous
oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons
are
without
a
doubt,
physical
and
chemical
substances
which
are
emitted
into
the
ambient
air
so
the
statute
is
clear.
we
also
reject
epa’s
alternative
basis
for
declining
petitioners
request
to
regulate
greenhouse
gases
namely
that
even
if
it
does
have
statutory
authority
to
regulate
greenhouse
gases,
it
would
be
unwise
to
exercise
that
authority
at
this
time.
that
conclusion
rest
on
reasoning
divorced
from
the
clean
air
act.
the
act
requires
epa
to
regulate
whenever
it
forms
a
judgment
than
an
air
pollutant
causes
or
contributes
to
air
pollution
which
may
reasonably
be
anticipated
to
endanger
public
health
and/or
welfare.
epa
has
offered
no
explanation
grounded
in
the
statute
as
to
why
it
cannot
or
will
not
exercise
its
discretion
to
make
such
a
judgment.
instead,
it
has
offered
a
longer
list
of
reasons
not
to
regulate.
for
example,
epa
said
that
a
number
of
voluntary
executive
branch
programs
already
provide
an
effective
response
to
the
threat
of
global
warming
regulating
greenhouse
gases
might
hamper
the
president’s
ability
to
negotiate
with
key
developing
nations
to
reduce
emissions
or
that
curtailing
motor-vehicle
emissions
would
reflect
an
inefficient
piecemeal
approach
to
address
the
climate
change
issue.
although
we
have
neither
the
expertise
nor
the
authority
to
evaluate
these
policy
judgments,
it
is
evidence
that
they
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
whether
greenhouse
gas
emissions
contribute
to
climate
change.
we
need
not
and
do
not
reach
the
question
whether
on
remand,
epa
must
make
an
endangerment
finding,
or
whether
policy
concerns
can
inform
epa’s
actions
in
the
event
that
it
make
such
a
finding.
we
hold
only
that
epa
must
ground
its
reasons
for
action
or
inaction
in
the
statute.
