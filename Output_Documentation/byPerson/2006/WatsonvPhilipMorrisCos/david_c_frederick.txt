mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
philip
morris
is
subject
to
such
specific
and
detailed
regulations
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
it
is
entitled
to
remove
this
purely
state
law
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court
under
the
federal
officer
removal
statute.
that
holding
is
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
court
articulated
the
wrong
test
for
determining
when
a
person
is
acting
under
a
federal
officer.
second,
the
court
misunderstood
the
federal
trade
commission's
regulatory
regime
with
respect
to
the
marketing
of
so-called
light
cigarettes.
and
third,
the
court's
approach
ignores
the
long
history
and
purposes
of
the
federal
officer
removal
provision
to
protect
the
federal
government
operations
from
interference
by
state
court
proceedings.
in
this
case,
and
in
this
court,
philip
morris
largely
abandons
the
eighth
circuit's
rationale
and
offers
an
alternate
ground
of
affirmance.
it
should
be
rejected.
the
ftc
has
not
delegated
authority
to
conduct
testing
to
philip
morris,
and
the
complaint
in
any
event
challenges
only
the
company's
marketing
and
not
its
testing
of
so-called
light
cigarettes.
now
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
eighth
circuit
applied
and
articulated
the
wrong
test
for
determining
when
a
person
is
acting
under
a
federal
officer.
the
proper
test,
as
this
court's
case
in
the
city
of
greenwood
versus
peacock
casey
elucidates,
is
when
the
person
is
aiding
or
acting
on
behalf
of
the
federal
officer
in
a
subordinate
role
in
the
officer's
discharge
of
official
functions.
that
is
not
what
is
happening
here.
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
federal
trade
commission
for
a
time
conducted
testing
on
the
tar
and
nicotine
levels
of
cigarettes
and
stopped
doing
so.
philip
morris
asserts
that
that
sequence
of
events
caused,
in
effect,
a
delegation
of
this
authority.
but
what
is
really
happening
is
that
philip
morris--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
there
is
nothing,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no
regulation,
this
is
no
order,
there
is
no
policy
statement,
there
is
no
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
ftc
before
congress.
there
is
nothing.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
and
the
reason
is
that
what
the
ftc
did
at
the
time
was,
it
determined
that
this
particular
cambridge
filter
method
was
the
preferred
method
for
ascertaining
the
level
of
tar
and
nicotine
in
cigarettes.
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit
opinion
of
federal--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
correct.
but
what
was
clear
in
the
brown
&
williamson
case
decided
by
the--
d.c.
circuit,
a
panel
of
judges
bork,
scalia
and
edwards--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
most
assuredly
did
get--
it
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
they
held
was
that
that
method,
the
cambridge
filter
method,
had
not
been
done
according
to
rulemaking,
a
trade
regulation
rule;
and
that,
therefore,
there
might
be
a
testing
mechanism
that
would
be
different
and
better,
but
that
with
respect
to
undertaking
the
deception
analysis,
which
is
what
the
ftc
is
charged
by...
with
doing
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission...
federal
trade
act,
it
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
would
be
some
method
that
the
cigarette
makers
were
attempting
to
use
that
would
be
deceptive;
and
what
the
court
in
the
d.c.
circuit
held
was
that
there
was
no
other
method
that
had
been
determined
at
that
time.
there
had
been
no
statement
or
proposed
rule
made
by
the
ftc,
and
so
for
purposes
of
determining
deception,
that
was
the
best
that
could
be
done,
while
leaving
open
the
possibility
that
the
ftc
would
promulgate
the
appropriate--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
because
that's
merely
compliance
with
rule
and
not
aiding
or
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
officer
in
a
subordinate
relationship
in
the
discharge
of
function.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
reporting
of
results
doesn't
change
the
hypothetical.
that's
also
compliance
with
the
law,
and
that
happens
all
the
time
in
the
government.
the
department
of
labor,
the
department
of
commerce,
the
federal
reserve,
all
of
those
agencies
routinely
require
reporting
on
the
part
of
industry.
but
the
reporting
of
information
does
not
transform
a
regulated
entity
into
a
federal
officer
for
purposes
of
these
cases.
and
the
court's
cases
are
highly
instructive
in
this
regard.
beginning
with
the
act
of
1815
that
began
the
federal
officer
removal,
the
court's
cases
have
held
that
when
a
person
is
deemed
to
be
acting
under,
the
person
is
acting
in
a
subordinate
relationship
to
the
federal
officer,
merely
complying
with
the
law
does
not
transform
a
regulated
entity
into
someone
subordinate
to
the
officer.
and
that
subordinate
relationship
is
what
is
critical
to
understanding
when
in
other
contexts
someone
might
have
a
better
claim
to
being
a
person
acting
under
a
federal
officer
than
philip
morris
can
assert
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
government
contractor
cases
present
a
quite
distinct
set
of
issues
that,
of
course,
is
not
present
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
contract
between
the
federal
trade
commission
and
philip
morris.
but
i
think
that
the
proper
way
of
looking
at
government
contractors
is
to
look
at
contextually
what
is
the
nature
of
the
contract?
does
the
contract
provide
for
ongoing
supervision
by
the
federal
officer
and
give
the
federal
officer
the
power
to
change
or
alter
the
conduct
of
the
contracting
party?
otherwise,
mere
specifications,
detailed
as
they
might
be,
constitute
simply
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
contract
rather
than
a
subordinate
relationship.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
a
couple--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
i
think
and
that's
why
it
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
mistake
for
the
court
to
either
categorically
say
all
government
contractors
are
in
or
all
government
contractors
are
out.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
my
theory
is
that
the
person
acting
under
has
to
be
aiding
or
acting
on
behalf
of
a
federal
officer
in
a
subordinate
relationship
in
the
performance
of
the
officer's
official
functions.
and
in
the
case
of
some
government
contractors,
like
the
chauffeur
in
maryland
versus
soper,
for
instance,
who
was
an
employee
of
the
reliable
transfer
company,
he
was
hired
by
the
maryland
director
of
prohibition
to
serve
with
the
agents
when
they
went
out
doing
their
investigations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
a
different
question,
justice
scalia.
the
question
of
under
color
of
office
as
the
statute
defines
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
acts
and
whether
there
is
a
causal
relationship
between
the
acts
that
are
charged
by
the
state
in
the
state
case
and
the
actions
of
the
people
involved.
in
the
soper
case,
the
problem
wasn't
the
color
of
office,
because
the
chauffeur
was
out
with
the
four
agents,
and
when
there
was
a
death
that
they
stumbled
upon,
the
question
arose
what
were
the
nature
of
the
facts,
not
whether
the
chauffeur
was
acting
under
color
of
office.
that
would
be
a
distinct
inquiry
not
related
specifically
to
whether
a
person
is
acting
under,
but
that's
the
third
part
of
this
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
in
the
medicare
context
this
happens.
blue
cross-blue
shield,
hired
out
by
the
government
to
pursuant
to
a
very
detailed
contract
to
engage
in
intermediary
payments,
and
audits,
forming
government
functions.
i
think
that
is
a
paradigmatic
instance
where
the
government
consists...
and
has
ongoing
supervisory
relationship
and
a
control
over
the
conduct
as
it
is
implementing
the
government's
function.
the
government
employment
example,
like
soper,
where
the
chauffeur
is
hired
and
brought
into
work
with
the
agents,
they're
having
a
ongoing
supervisory
relationship,
telling
him
where
to
drive,
what
to
do,
where
to
go.
they
are
able
to
alter
his
conduct
in
the
same
way.
in
many
procurement
instances,
that
is
not
true.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
compliance
with
the
regulation.
there
are
all
sorts
of
instances,
justice
kennedy,
where
industry
is
required
to
do
certain
things
before
they
can
bring
their
product
to
market.
that's
not
acting--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
are
performing
a
function
at
the
government's
direction
for
the
government.
the
government
used
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
compliance
doesn't
constitute
a
delegation,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
reason
is
quite
clear
from
the
fact
that
the
code
of
federal
regulations
is
full
of
all
sorts
of
very
specific
instructions
to
industry
actors.
but
when
they
comply
with
those
rules
they
are
not
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government.
they
are
simply
fulfilling
a
legal
obligation
that
all
americans
have
to
fulfill
when
confronted
with
a
question
of
federal
law.
the
situation
for
acting
under
is
different,
and
in
the
medicaid
context,
there's
a
very
special
bureaucracy
that
has
been
created
under
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
perform
government
functions
that
used
to
be
performed
that
are
now
contracted
out
to
blue
cross-blue
shield,
and
i
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
situation.
but
the
government,
of
course,
in
a
multi-trillion-dollar
budget
purchases
all
sorts
of
items
all
the
time.
many
of
them
are
off
the
shelf.
and
others
are
subject
to
very
specific
and
detailed
specifications.
but
the
compliance
by
a
contractor
with
specific
and
detailed
instructions
would
not
itself
transform
that
entity
into
a
person
acting
under
a
federal
officer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
it
would
be
transforming
a
preemption
defense
into
an
opportunity
to
use
a
federal
officer
removal
to
have
a
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
preemption
is
an
issue
that
can
be
decided
by
state
courts,
and
the
mere
fact
that
someone
is
complying
with
detailed
federal
regulations,
and
therefore
is
able
to
claim
the
cause
of
action
is
preempted
as
a
result
of
those
federal
regulations,
does
not
transform
the
person
into
a
person
acting
under
a
federal
officer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
contract,
justice
scalia.
the
things
that
the
court
would
look
at
would
depend--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
court
would
look
at
is
whether
there
is
a
ongoing
supervisory
relationship
and
whether
the
federal
officer
has
the
power
to
transform
or
alter
the
conduct.
if
those
circumstances
are
met,
then
there
would
be
a
very
strong
argument
that
the
person
is
acting
under
the
federal
officer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
of
course,
this
court
has
held
that
in
that
context
there
is
not
state
action
in
that
particular
circumstance.
in
fact,
in
the
third
circuit,
philip
morris
defended
its
actions
against
a
very
similar
claim
regarding
its
marketing,
that
it
was
not
a
state
actor
for
purposes
of
a
bivens
action
or
a
section
1983
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there...
that
would
certainly
be
a
simple
way
to
determine
whether
a
person
is
acting
under
a
federal
officer,
if
it
meets
the
entwinement
test
articulated
by
this
court
in
that
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
it
doesn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i
think
that
the
proper
standard,
justice
scalia,
as
i've
said,
is
whether
there
is
a
ongoing
supervisory
relationship
and
the
government
has
the
power
to
alter
the
actor's
conduct.
if
those
two
conditions
are
met
then
a
person
can
be
said
to
be
acting
under
the
federal
officer
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
not
on
a
basis
that
is
i
think
appropriate
to
understand
a
subordinate
relationship.
the
fact
that
there
is
alteration
through
government
regulation
is
simply
compliance
with
law.
but
to
be
acting
under
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
cases...
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
greenwood
case,
which
the
other
side
basically
ignores...
in
that
case,
in
footnotes
17
and
20,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
phrase
"acting
under"
is
acting
in
that
kind
of
subordinate
relationship
in
the
execution
of
laws.
compliance
is
insufficient.
otherwise,
it
would
blow
the
whole
statute
apart.
everybody
in
a
regulated
industry
would
able
to
remove
under
the
federal
officer
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
in
our
cert
papers,
and
we
didn't
repeat
them
in
our
merits
papers,
we
give
examples
where
a
window
blinds
manufacturer,
a
medical
device
manufacturer,
a
whole
series
of
others,
a
bank,
a
credit
union,
have
attempted...
after
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
have
removed
cases
to
federal
court
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
federal
officers
because
they
are
subjected
to
far
more
extensive
regulations
than
philip
morris.
in
fact,
if
you
turn
to
volume
16
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
and
turn
to
part
408,
there's
a
heading,
and
it
says
deceptive
unfair
advertising
of
cigarettes
for
health
benefits.
then
underneath
it
it
says
"intentionally
left
blank".
and
the
argument
that
these
other
entities
have
made
is
there
are
no
federal
regulations
concerning
the
marketing
of
"light"
cigarettes
but
there
are
regulations
concerning
our
products.
so
therefore,
we
must
be
a
federal
officer
because
the
regime
governing
us
is
far
more
specific
and
detailed
than
it
is
for
cigarettes.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
this
is
a
perfect
case
for
federal
officer
removal,
there
are
easily
40,000
others
in
the
state
courts
waiting
to
he
removed.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
in
lots
and
lots
of
areas,
the
federal
government
wants
safer,
cleaner
cars,
safer
refrigerators--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
do--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
does
not
make
a
difference.
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
is
if
you
look
on
your
refrigerator,
if
you
look
on
your
lawn
mower,
if
you
look
on
your
automobile,
there
are
government
standard
tests
that
have
to
be
complied
with
for
an
industry
to
be
able
to
sell
its
products.
and
if
philip
morris
is
correct
here,
you
are
going
to
be
announcing
a
dramatic
transformation
of
the
role
of
federal
and
state
courts,
because
every
time
there
is
even
a
colorable
argument
for
preemption,
the
industry
will
take
the
case
to
federal
court
saying
we're
acting
under
the
federal
officer,
and
therefore,
don't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
description
shouldn't
make
a
difference,
particularly
where
it
is
in
a
voluntary
agreement
that
was
not
put
out
for
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
and
it
was
done
for
precisely
this
reason,
justice
scalia.
for
decades,
the
cigarette
companies
were
rightly
perceived
as
deceiving
the
public
about
the
health
content
of
their
products.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
also
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
expected
the
companies
to
police
each
other,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
when
the
barclay
cigarette
came
up.
philip
morris
was
the
one
that
complained
and
said
that
cigarette
doesn't
comply,
it's
been
manipulating
the
ftc
cambridge
filter
method.
so
the
ftc
found
a
cheaper
way
to
do
regulation.
compliance
with
rules
does
not
transform
an
entity
into
a
federal
officer.
thank
you.
