chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
05-1284,
watson
versus
philip
morris
companies.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
them
to
adopt
a
new
method
of
testing
tar
and
nicotine
that
yields
numbers
that
are
far
lower
than
the
government's
method,
and
to
publish
an
ad
saying
these
are
our
tar
and
nicotine
figures,
and
the
ftc
would
have
no
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
just
the
preferred
method,
but
presumably
the
only
one
they
would
allow.
if
you
used
another
one,
they
would
bring
a
deceptive
trade
practices
action
very
quickly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
still
might--
have
gotten
it
right.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understand
you
have
a
dispute
about
whether
that
is
this
case,
but
there
are
many
areas
where
the
government
requires
testing
of
products.
you
know,
the
strength
of
seat
belts
and
stuff,
and
they
specify
very
precise
means
to
which
those
tests
have
to
be
conducted.
and
if
someone,
a
manufacturer
is
complying
with
those
requirements,
and
a
challenge
is
brought,
saying
something
to
the
effect
that
that
test
doesn't
give
you
a
good
measure
or
something,
in
that
situation
would
this
removal
provision
apply?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
government
says
you've
got
to
test
your
cars,
you
know,
every
three
months
or
something,
and
you've
got
to
send
us
the
results
of
a
random...
random
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
distinction.
the
drug
companies...
the
government
wants
to
make
sure
that
drugs
are
safe
and
effective
and
so
they
issue
regulations
saying
here's
how
you
have
to
test
it.
they're
just,
you
could
say,
delegating
the
testing
to
the
companies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
a
difference
between
you
are
providing
products
and
complying
with
testing.
in
other
words,
and
if,
in
fact,
the
government
specifies
precisely
how
the
testing
is
supposed
to
be
done
to
determine
whether
it,
the
government,
will
approve
the
marketing
of
a
particular
drug,
and
the
challenge,
the
litigation
is
to
the
testing.
somebody
sues
as
drugs
company
and
says
you
know,
you
tested
this
drug
wrong,
we
think
you
should
have
tested
it
some
other
way,
and
the
drug
company
says
the
government
told
us
how
to
test
it...
why
in
that
situation
aren't
they
acting
under
a
government
official?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's...
what's
your
conclusion?
that
those
are
not
people
acting
under
federal
officers--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
policing
sounds
like--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about...
what
about
usda
food
inspection?
isn't
a
lot
of
that
delegated
to
the
producers
rather
than
the
government
officials?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
still
get
a
government
stamp.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
are
a
federally
certified
inspector
you
are
acting
under--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
private
transportation
of
mail?
is
the
private
contractor
who's
carrying
u.s.
mail,
is
that
person...
could
he
remove
a
case
under
this
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
care
what
kind
of
testing
they
do?
they
can
change
the
method
and
change
the
way
to
resolve--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
you've
been
talking
a
lot
about
testing.
but
when
you
look
at
the
complaint
in
this
case,
testing
is
a
small
part
of
it.
they're
complaining
about
the
modification
of
the
tobacco
blend,
the
weight,
rod
length,
the
circumference,
use
of
reconstituted
tobacco
sheets.
in
other
words
there's
a
lot
going
on
here
in
the
complaint
here
besides
the
testing.
and
if
the
government
is
in
no
way
specifying
the
tobacco
blend,
the
weight,
the
length,
all
these
other
things
that
are
allegedly
part
of
the
manipulation
to
affect
the
figures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
justice
kennedy.
if
we
determine
that
you're
acting
under
the
direction
of
a
federal
officer,
that
would
seem
to
me
highly
pertinent
on
the
merits
of
a
preemption
argument.
so
it
would
not
be
just
the
forum,
but
kind
of
getting
into
the
preemption
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
frederick,
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
the
ftc
told
us
why
they
did
it.
they
did
it
because
they
could
save
the
money
by
having
the
industry
do
it
rather
than
them
doing
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
