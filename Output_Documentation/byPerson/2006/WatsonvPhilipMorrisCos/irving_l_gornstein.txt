mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
manufacturers
of
cars,
drugs,
medical
devices,
pesticides,
home
appliances
and
numerous
other
consumer
good
market
their
products
in
accordance
with
detailed
and
specific
federal
government
regulation.
if
that
in
a
colorable
preemption
defense
were
sufficient
to
trigger
removal,
then
it
would
create
the
potential
for
a
very
major
shift
of
traditional
state
law
litigation
from
state
to
federal
court.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
let
me
talk
about...
there
are,
there
are
numerous
testing
requirements.
the
automobile
industry
has
to
test
for
fuel
efficiency;
it
has
to
test
for
crash
testing
under
very
specific
requirements.
the
home
appliances
have
to
be
tested
for
energy
efficiency
under
federal
requirements--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--is...
the
government
often
says
exactly
what
the
test
has
to
be.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i...
i...
i
can't
say
in
every
case
that
somebody
is
there
to
make
sure--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but...
the
government
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--policing
and
enforcing
the
testing
requirements,
and
there's
testing
in
all
these
areas.
the
other
thing
to
say
is
that
there's
no--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--they
are
not
people
acting,
because
if
they--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
government's
policing
is
enforcing
the
law.
people
who
are,
who
are
regulating
their
products
in
accordance
with
detailed
and
specific
federal
government
regulation
are
acting
on
their
own
behalf
in
marketing
the
products
in...
on...
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
they
are
not
acting
under
federal
officers...
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal...
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
government--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
can
have
different
situations.
and
i'm
not
sure
about
the
precise
one
you're
talking
about.
but
you
can
have
situations
and
the
faa
is
one,
where
the
faa
has
a
statute
which
says
you
can
delegate
to
third
parties
inspecting
aircrafts,
and
the
agency
certifies
through
regulation
that
this
person
is
inspecting
as
a
representative
of
the
faa.
now
that's
a
varied
situation.
in
that
kind
of
situation
the
person
would
acting
under.
but
if
the
person
is
simply
complying
with
federal
requirements
about
how
to
test,
that
is
private
behavior,
acting
on
their
own
behalf,
in
order
to
further
the
marketing
of
their
products.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
certified
as
a
representative
of
the
faa,
yes,
you
are.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
standard
for
contracts
is
some
contracts
are
in
and
some
contracts
are
out
in
our
minds,
depending
on
whether
the...
they
are
subject
to
the
guidance,
supervision,
or
control
of
federal
officers.
and
so
if
they
are
performing
a
service
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
and
they
are
subject
to
control
or
supervision,
then
they
could
be
acting
under
federal
officers.
now
the
situation
here,
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
used,
simply
acting
in
conformity
with
detailed
and
specific
federal
regulation,
is
one
that
would
lead,
as
i
said,
to
a
very
substantial
change
in
where
state
court
claims
have
been
litigated
up
until
now.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
the
problem
with
that,
what
you're
saying,
is
the
1948
statute
expanded
it
all
federal
officers.
so
if
federal
officers
were
running
that
cafeteria,
those
federal
officers
could
remove
because
they
are
performing
a
duty
under
federal
law
to
provide
that
service
to
federal
employees.
now,
once
the
statute
expanded
out
in
1948
to
cover
federal
officers
who
perform
any
function,
not
just
enforcement
functions,
it
carried
with
it
persons
who
act
under
federal
officers
in
performing
those
very
same
functions.
so
if
the
federal
government
hired
an
employee
to
serve
food
who
was
acting
under
a
federal
officer
who
was
responsible
for
the
delivery
of
food,
that
person
would
be
acting
under
a
federal
officer
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
assuming
that
the
person
was
subject
to
the
control,
guidance,
and
oversight
in
the
delivery
of
that
food.
now,
this
case
is
very
far
from
the
historical
examples
of
citizens
being
called
upon
by
customs
officers
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws
or
the
chauffeur
who
was,
under
a
federal
employment
contract,
who
then...
assisted
revenue
officers
in
carrying
out
a
raid
on
a
distillery,
or
the
military
corporal
who
was
involved
in
assisting
federal
officers
in
making
an
arrest.
those
are
the
historical
examples.
they
point
to
the
principle
that
you
are
talking
about
people
who
are
in
a
subordinate
position
and
who
are
acting
on
behalf
of
or
otherwise
assisting
federal
officers
in
carrying
out
their
duties.
as
for
the
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
here,
that
is
that
there
has
been
a
delegation,
testing
delegation
of
authority,
there
has
been
no
delegation
of
authority.
it
is
unusual
for
the
government
to
delegate
out
its
own
regulatory
responsibilities
to
the
very
industry
it
is
regulating
and
it
didn't
do
that
here.
what
the
government
did
is
that
it
had
at
one
time
its
own
testing
program.
it
eliminated
that
testing
program
altogether,
which
had
not
been
required
by
statute
but
was
simply
the
result
of
a
commission
vote.
and
after
that,
the
industry
continued
to
carry
on
the
very
testing
that
it
had
been
doing
all
along
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
among
industry
participants.
now,
even
if--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--actually,
the
federal
trade
commission
cannot
require
the
particular
testing
method.
but
even
if
you
assume
it
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
simply
be
a
regulatory
condition
on
the
marketing
of
a
product.
and
acting
in
accordance
with
a
regulatory
condition
on
the
marketing
of
a
product
is
not
acting
under
a
federal
officer,
for
the
reasons
i've
discussed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
has
been
government
litigation
against
the
cigarette
companies
for
allegations
that
are
very
similar
to
the
complaint
in
this
case
except
that
it
is
being
brought
under
the
rico
statute.
that
litigation
is
pending
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
basic
allegation,
one
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
is
that
the
cigarette
companies
have
falsely
marketed
their
products
as
being
lest
dangerous
than
other
products
when,
in
fact,
they
are
not.
now,
the
final
point
to
be
made
is,
even
if
there
was
a
delegation
of
authority
here,
it
would
not
affect
the
disposition
of
this
case
because
this
complaint
does
not
challenge
the
testing
itself.
what
this
complaint
says
is
that
these...
that
the
respondent
here
engaged
in
deceptive
advertising
by
essentially
designing
cigarettes
that
would
cheat
the
test
and
then
marketing
the
cigarettes
as
light
when
in
fact
they
are
not.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
