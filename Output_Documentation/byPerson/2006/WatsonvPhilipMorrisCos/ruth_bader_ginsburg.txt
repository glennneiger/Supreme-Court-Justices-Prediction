justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is...
this
is
certainly
not
your
revenue
officer
needing
help
from
a
citizen
or
the
federal
agent
going
to
close
down
a
still
during
prohibition.
but
what
about
the
government
contractor
cases
that
are
cited,
the
agent
orange
was
one
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
prison
case,
there's
not
any
if
about
it.
a
state,
municipality,
has
a
contract
with
a
private
entrepreneur
to
run
a
prison.
one
question
that
i
think
must
have
come
up
in
that
context
comes
under
the
1983
action
in...
against
a,
a
prison
guard,
a
privately
hired
prison
guard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that.
the
government
is
always
altering
people's
conduct
when
it
regulates
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
been
done?
i
mean,
this
is...
i
don't
recall
any
case
like
this.
are
there
other
product
liability
cases
that
are
removed
from
state
court
to
federal
court
on
a
similar
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
was
there
any
government
litigation
against
the
cigarette
companies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
again,
you're
talking
about
an
agency
that
has
set
certain
standards
that
the
entity
its
regulating
must
meet.
they
must
meet
all
kinds
of
requirements
for
certain
kinds
of
tests
by
osha,
say,
for
example.
think
of
pesticides,
think
of
hazardous
substance...
quite
precise
tests
that
the
government
says
you
must
make
this
test
before
you
market
that
dangerous
product.
i
don't
see
how
cigarettes
are
any
different
from
hazardous
wastes,
pesticides,
just
the
vast
number
of
potentially
dangerous
to
health
products
that
are
marketed
and
the
government
says:
we're
not
going
to
let
you
put
those
things
out
on
the
market
unless
you
go
through
a
certain
testing
regimen.
that
doesn't
make
the
party
an
agent
of
the
government
for
the
testing
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
must
be
many
times
when
an
agency
prescribes
a
test
that
a
regulated
party
must
comply
with.
it's
still
a
relationship
of
a
regulator,
the
ftc,
sets
standards
that
the
regulated
party
has
to
meet.
i
just
don't
see...
it
could
be
called
ftc
test>
["],
but
it's
a
test
for
what?
are
you
complying
with
the
law
when
you're
manufacturing
and
marketing
this
product?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that,
mr.
olson,
that
the
cigarette
companies
wanted
to
make
a
light
brand
so
that
they
could
keep
customers
who
might
be
tempted
to
quit
if
there
was
only
the
heavy
kind.
but
to
say
that,
the
light
cigarettes
were
forced
on
the
cigarette
companies
by
the
ftc
certainly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
any
product
that
the
government
supervises,
certainly
the
government
would
want
to
promote
a
safer...
i
mean,
think
of
a
jet
ski.
think
of...
products
are
marketed
because
people
want
them,
and
off
course
the
government
as
supervisor
will
want
to
encourage
a
safer
product.
but
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
mr.
olson.
the
removal
area
has
been
really
closely
guarded
by
congress.
you
know
it's
not
easy
to
get
a
case
out
of
state
court
and
move
it
to
the
federal
court.
in
fact,
congress
has
said
if
the
federal
court
shifts
it
back,
no
matter
how
wrong
a
that
decision
was,
it
stays
in
the
state
court.
one
can't
remove...
you
may
have
a
wonderful
federal
defense,
a
preemption
defense.
you
can't
remove
on
that
basis.
you
may
have
a
counterclaim,
so
you're
really
the
same
as
a
plaintiff.
you
can't
remove
on
the
basis
of
a
counterclaim.
well,
congress
has
been
so
careful
to
let
the
state
courts
do
state
tort
litigation.
then
we
are
supposed
to
read
into
a
federal
officer
removal
statute,
that
kind
of,
the
removal
of
a
state
tort
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court?
because
that's
quite
the
fashion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
there's
one
different.
if
you're
doing
it
for
the
government,
the
government
says
we
want
agent
orange;
we
know
it's
a
very
dangerous
substance.
so
they
give
you
an
order;
we're
going
to
make
very
precise
specifications.
but
you're
doing
it
for
us.
we,
the
government,
want
that,
and
so
we
are
going
to
put
tight
controls
on
your
manufacturing
it
for
us.
a
little
was
different
from
a
commercial
company
going
out
to
sell
market
goods
to
the
public
at
large?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
company
is
doing
it
so
it
can
stay
in
business
and
market
this
product,
not
as
a
service
to
the
u.s.
government.
