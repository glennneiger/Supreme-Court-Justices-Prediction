justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
right?
if
i
have
it...
i'm
using
sort
of
a
silly
example
to
explain
it
to
myself.
but
i'm
thinking
the
fda...
or
no,
the
agriculture
department
decides
they're
really
interested
in
red
apples
not
being
red.
so
they
say
we
hire
thousands
of
apple
lookers,
and
the
apple
lookers
look
at
all
the
apples
and
they
devise
a
redness
test
which
is
really
fabulous,
you
know,
very
precise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
fda.
the
fda
has
the
apple
looking
redness
test,
and
the
apple
lookers
apply
the
test.
and
if
you
pass
the
test,
you
can
say
red
apple,
and
if
you
don't
pass
the
test
you
don't.
now
i'll
give
you
two
different
things
that
happen.
one
day
because
of
budget
cuts
the
fda
hires
a
lipstick
company
to
look,
because
they're
experts
on
redness;
they
know
how
to
perform
a
test.
[laughter]
the
other
possibility
is
they
say
to
the
apple
companies,
you
do
your
own
looking.
now
i
think
there'd
be
the
difference
that
you're
trying
to
argue,
and
i
don't
think
it
cuts
or
you.
because
in
the
first
case,
what
they've
done
is
hire
somebody
to
perform
a
governmental
function.
in
the
second
case,
what
they've
done
is
to
the
people
who
are
regulated
and
have
the
interest,
in
announcing
they
have
red
apples,
they've
said,
you
do
it
yourself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
wouldn't
be
relevant,
because
the...
the
problem
with
the,
with
the
approach
that
you're
taking,
as
i
see
it,
would
be
that,
that
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
instances
where
a
regulated
firm,
the
regulation
meaning
yes/no,
market/not
market;
yes/no,
advertise/not
advertise,
performs
all
kinds
of
tests
to
see
if
it
is
yes
or
no.
and
if
you're
going
to
start
taking
that
kind
of
firm
and
breaking
it
apart
to
say
whether
it's
doing
the
testing
part
or
some
other
part,
you're
really
opening
the
gates.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
function
is
so
separable
and
it
is
so
much
a
ftc
function
and
it
is
so
much
like
delegating
it
to
the
third
party
that
did
nothing
of
the
testing,
that
even
if
you
delegate
it
to
the
second
party
which
does
testing
and
then
benefits
from
the
testing,
that's
still
not
enough
to
take
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
have
i
got
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
i...
so,
so
to
use
my
silly
example,
i
mean,
it
is
like
the
lipstick
company.
you're
saying,
well
if
they
did
it
to
the
lipstick
company
it
would
be
clearly
that
they're
the
government
agent.
and
it
is
so
technical,
so
governmental,
so
heavily
involved
with
the
government
for
testing,
that
even
though
you
give
it
to
the
apple
growers
themselves,
they
are
still
government
agents
when
they
perform
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i,
i
see
the
argument
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
is
there
any,
any
authority
ever,
that
you
found
for
that?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
quick
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
complaint
that
alleges
you
didn't
perform
the
tests
properly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
apple
institute
who's
doing
the
testing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
said
apple
institute.
you
know,
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
case
where
it
was
the
apple
institute
or
whatever
it
was
that
was
the
delegate,
and
then
they
applied
the
test,
and
the
people
they
were
applying
the
test
to
weren't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
watson
versus
philip
morris
and
about
philip
morris
is
marketing
of
two
brands
of
cigarette
marlboro
and
cambridge
lights
and
when
it
markets
them
it
says
that
they
are
light
cigarettes
that
means
they
contain
less
tar
and
nicotine
than
other
cigarettes.
the
petitioners
loretta
lawson,
lisa
watson,
they
had
filed
a
state
court
law
suit
claiming
that
when
philip
morris
markets
the
cigarettes
in
that
way
they
violate
a
state
unfair
business
practice
law.
philip
morris
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
under
a
statute
that
permits
removal
by
“any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof”
but
there
is
a
parenthetical
in
there
which
says
or
any
person
acting
under
that
officer.
now,
the
lower
courts
held
the
removal
even
though
it
seems
to
talk
about
federal
officers
was
permissible
here
because
when
philip
morris
tested
and
labeled
the
cigarettes
it
was
acting
under
officers
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
is
the
agency
of
the
federal
government
so
they
could
remove
it.
but
we
disagree
with
that.
the
basic
question
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
term
‘acting
under’
acting
under
a
federal
officer
and
we
decide
and
we
set
forth
the
reasons
that
created
length
in
our
opinion
that
that
term
encompasses
a
private
person.
when
that
person
is
subject
to
the
guidance
and
control
of
the
federal
official
that
only
affect
private
person
also
assists
or
helps
to
carry
out
the
duties
of
tasks
of
the
federal
officer
and
what
does
that
mean.
a
case
law
provides
some
examples,
as
a
case
for
example
when
the
statute
used
to
discover
federal
revenue
officer
and
there
was
a
person
who
wasn’t
a
federal
revenue
officer,
he
was
in
the
army
and
he
helped
the
revenue
officer
break
up
in
illegal
risky
steal
and
in
the
process
he
chopped
the
suspect
who
was
trying
to
escape
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
tennessee
indicted
him
for
murder
and
he
removed
the
case.
the
court
said,
that
was
proper,
you
were
aiding
the
federal
official
and
there
was
another
case
where
a
group
of
federal
prohibition
agents
were
trying
to
do
their
work
and
they
had
a
driver
but
the
driver
wasn’t
working
for
the
federal
government
but
still
the
court
said
that
driver
even
though
is
a
private
person
was
helping
and
assisting
the
federal
officers
so
you’re
within
the
statute
but
is
so
if
you
look
at
those
cases
just
complying
with
the
law
is
not
the
kind
of
help
or
assistance
they’re
talking
about.
even
though
in
english
sometime
you
could
say
a
tax
payer
who
fills
out
a
complex
form
for
a
well-behaved
federal
prisoner
you
could
say
they
are
helping
law
enforcement
but
that
isn’t
the
sense
of
help
that
is
involved
here.
so,
history
language
president
purpose
all
make
clear
that
a
company
that’s
regulated
and
just
complies
with
a
regulatory
order
even
if
it’s
a
very
complicated
one
cannot
remove
under
this
probation.
now,
philip
morris
says
that
well,
we
are
actually
the
delegatee
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
doing
testing
of
cigarettes.
well,
we’ve
looked
to
that
and
we
don’t
see
that
they
were
employees
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
there
is
no
agency
principle
relationship;
there
is
no
federal
contract
or
government
relationship.
the
ftc
does
not
pay
philip
morris
to
do
this
and
we
can’t
find
any
formal
order
of
delegation.
so
we
think
it
just
a
regulated
company
and
a
regulated
isn’t
really
helping
the
federal
government
in
the
sense
that
this
statute
means.
so
we
reverse
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
our
decision
is
unanimous.
