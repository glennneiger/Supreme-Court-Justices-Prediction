mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit
is
that
official
ftc
tar
and
nicotine
ratings
generated
by
testing
performed
by
respondents
under
the
ftc's
supervision
and
transmitted
to
the
public
in
respondent's
advertising
at
the
ftc's
insistence
is
misleading;
therefore,
the
creation
and
transmission
of
the
allegedly
misleading
data
for
which
respondents
are
being
sued
were
acts
performed
by
respondents
to
assist
the
ftc
in
performing
its
official
responsibilities.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
the
ftc
did
not
do
it
through
a
regulation.
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
pages
93
to
110
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
would
see
testimony
by
the
chairman
of
the
ftc
and
the
head
of
the
consumer
protection
part
of
the
ftc
saying:
we
chose
not
to
do
it
by
regulation
because
we
found
that
it
was
much
more
efficient,
much
more
fast,
and
much
for
effective
to
force
the
tobacco
companies
into
what
is
called
a
voluntary
agreement
requiring
precisely
that
information.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
would.
in
a
1978
advisory
opinion,
which
is
found
on
pages
202
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
ftc
stated
categorically...
and
the
joint
appendix,
by
the
way,
justice
souter,
is
full
of
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about.
the
ftc
said
tar
values
in
cigarette
advertising
must
be
consistent
with
the
latest
ftc
number
and
stated
that
it
would
be
deceptive
to
advertise
higher
numbers
or
lower
numbers
or
different
numbers.
in
other
words,
the
enforcement
wouldn't
be
through
the
enactment
of
a
regulation.
the
ftc...
again,
i
refer
to
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
ftc:
the
ftc
does
things
this
way
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
source
of
the
ftc
number
is
the
ftc
test,
alternatively
called
the
cambridge
filter
test.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
the
ftc
calls
it
the
ftc
test.
it
was
devised
by
the
ftc.
it
has
a
specific
set
of
requirements.
the
ftc
itself
performed
that
test
for
a
number
of
years.
then
in
1987
the
test
was
transmitted...
the
ftc
stopped
doing
it
and
allowed
the
industry
to
do
it
itself
because
the...
again,
in
that
same
testimony
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
he
said
that:
it
will
be
more
effective
and
easier
for
us,
and
we
can
use
our
funds
for
other
purposes
if
the
industry
does
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
fairly...
what
happened,
it's
fairly
clear
from
what
the
ftc
has
said,
they
would
bring
an
action
for
deceptive
advertising
if
there
was
anything
involved
in
the
marketing
of
those
cigarettes
that
had
to
do
with
tar
and
nicotine
levels.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
they
wouldn't.
but
that
is
not
of
course
this
case.
this
case
involves--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
history
of
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
and
it's
clear.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
the
answer
is
that
the
ftc
announced
a
proposed
rule.
it
then
sent
a
letter
to
the
tobacco
companies
saying,
it
would
be
much
easier
for
us
and
much
easier
for
you
to
enter
into
a
voluntary
agreement.
it
gave
them
30
days
to
come
up
with
a
voluntary
agreement.
they
produced
an
agreement
which
the
ftc
rejected
because
it
allowed
certain
flexibility
with
respect
to
the
testing
and
didn't
adhere
specifically
to
the
ftc
test
that
you're
referring
to.
it
rejected
that
first
agreement.
the
tobacco
companies
came
back
with
another
agreement.
the
ftc
accepted
that
agreement
and
said
that
it
would
enforce
the
voluntary
agreement
against
the
tobacco
companies
and
if
they
deviated
from
it
they'd
return
to
the
rulemaking
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
that
question,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
not
merely
compliance
with
the
rule.
this
is
not
merely
testing
of
products.
the
ftc
created
the
standard.
it
created
the
testing
mechanism.
it
performed
the
tests
according
to
very
detailed
criteria.
those
tests
are
now
performed
by
the
industry
for
the
ftc.
those
test
results
must
be
reported
to
the
ftc.
the
ftc
then
reports
those
results
to
congress
and
publishes
them
in
the
federal
register
as
the
official
ftc
tobacco
ratings,
and
then
the
ftc
requires--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
yes,
justice
scalia.
and
in
the
case
that
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
not
careless.
they
are
pronouncing
the
facts.
and
in
a
case
that
you
participated
in
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
brief
in
that
case,
the
brown
and
williamson
case
that
was
mentioned
before
justice
bork
wrote
the
opinion,
in
that
brief
i
counted...
i
stopped
counting
about
10
or
12
times
after
the
words
ftc
test
methodology>
["],
the
ftc
official
ratings>
["],
the
ftc
this,
the
ftc
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
let
me
try
again,
justice
ginsburg.
if
the
ftc
had
said
to
four
local
hospitals,
please
perform
this
test
according
to
this
specification
for
us,
the
ftc,
and
then
give
us
these
results,
which
we
will
then
publish
as
the
ftc
official
ratings
of
cigarettes,
and
then
if
those
hospitals
were
sued
because
the
testing
and
the
results
were
alleged
to
be
misleading,
i
think
even
the
government
would
admit
that
that
case
could
be
removed
under
the
federal
officer
removal
statute.
there
is
nothing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
it
would
be
a
vastly
different
situation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
difference,
the
difference
is,
is
that,
a,
the
test
is,
is...
the
ftc
and
the
record
is
full
of
this,
too;
the
ftc
set
a
goal
for
itself
very
early
in
the
regulatory
process.
it
wanted
consumers
to
purchase
lower
tar
and
nicotine
cigarettes.
now
how
was
it
going
to
accomplish
that,
the
ftc
goal?
it
devised
this
test.
it
made
it
official
ftc
test.
official
ftc
ratings.
what
this
is
doing
is
conscripting
in
a
way
or
accepting
here's
what
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in,
in
29...
this
is
in
the
record.
the
ftc
set
forth
goals,
it's
29
federal
register
530,
in...
on
january
22,
1964,
that
the
ftc
described
its
goal
as
to
encourage
the
development
of
less
hazardous
cigarettes.
that
was
done
in
conjunction
with
a
earlier
or
a
contemporaneous...
nearly
contemporaneous
surgeon
general
report
which
is
reported
at
joint
appendix
pages
57
to
60,
that
the
government
had
as
its
goal
the
responsible
promotion
of
cigarettes
low
in
tar
and
nicotine.
now
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
government
says
that
the
test
is...
is,
that
if
an
individual,
private
actor,
is
assisting
the
federal
government
in
performing
the
official
government
function,
the
case
is
appropriate
to
be
removed.
that
is
what
the
government
says
section
1441(a)(1)
means.
this
court
has
said
that
section
shall
be
liberally
construed,
not
narrow
or
limited
in
its
construction,
and
not
frustrated
by
a
narrow,
grudging
interpretation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
apple
lookers'
device?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
ah,
but
justice
breyer,
what
happens
here
is
they
say
you
do
it
yourself,
and
the
chairman
of
the...
chairman
of
the
ftc
said
why.
here's
why;
he
said
it's
better
undertaken
by
private
researchers.
it's
a
mechanism
that
we
can
rely
on
to
ensure
accurate
reporting.
then,
what
the
ftc
did
is
to
supervise
the
performance
of
the
test.
it
goes
into
the
laboratories.
it
makes
sure
it
has
done
it
its
way.
and
then
it
accepts
those
results--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
we're...
we're
not.
we're
suggesting...
you're...
what
you're
doing
in
your
question
and
your
statement
is
to
disaggregate
the
pieces
of
the
process
here.
here
it
is
the
ftc's
goal,
it's
ftc's
method;
it's
the
ftc's
test
which
is
supervised
but
done
by
the
companies.
and
then
it
becomes
the
ftc
official
ratings
which
they
then
must
transmit
to
the
company
in
their
advertising.
and
now
they're
sued
because
those
ratings
that
they've
done
according,
for
the
ftc,
according
to
the
ftc
standards,
are
alleged
to
be
misleading.
so
it's...
it's
not
possible
to
disaggregate
it.
it
is
a
whole
spectrum;
the
testing
itself
and
the
reporting...
is
done
by
the
industry
because
the
ftc
wants
it
as
its
official
numbers,
and
it
wants
its
official
numbers
given
to
the
consumers.
and
it
is
setting
an
advisory
opinion,
even
if
you
tell
them
that
your
cigarettes
have
higher
tar
or
lower
tar,
if
you
don't
report
our
numbers,
you
will
be
sued
for
deceptive
advertising.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
i
was
saying
in
answer--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
so.
let
me
restate
it,
because
i
think
i
understand
what
you've
said.
and
i
think
what
i
was
trying
to
say
with
respect
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
if
the...
all
those
private
hospitals
did
it,
i
think
the
government
would
admit,
the
federal...
and
then
is
there
an
exception
in
the
statute?
if
the
regulated
entity,
in
this
case
the
tobacco
company,
does
it
rather
than
the
hospital?
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
agency
decided
they
are
any--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yeah.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is,
as
the
eighth
circuit
said,
a
very
unusual
situation.
but
the
closest
analogies
are,
are
to
the
government
contractor
cases.
and
by
the
way,
it
doesn't
require
a
contract
to
be
acting
under
the
supervision.
i
heard
the
government
say
that
what
you
had
to
have
is
someone
supervised
by
the
government
with
the
government's
power
to
alter
the
actor's
conduct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice,
i
understand
there's
a
distinction.
because
the
government
is
the
actual
consumer
of
that
product.
but
here
the
government
announced
that
its
goals
were
to
accomplish
a
market
in
lower
tar
cigarettes.
and
it
said
with
respect
to
the
testing,
it's
better
undertaken
by
private
researchers.
so
it
was
fulfilling
the
government's
desire
to
have
something
they
could
save
the
money,
if
they
close
down
the
laboratory,
they
said
in
this
testimony,
we'll
use
the
money
for
enforcement
pumps
against
the
cigarette
company.
we
can
regulate
and
determine,
fulfill
the
official
functions
of
the
government
more
effectively,
more
efficiently
if
we
do
it
this
way.
so
it
is
the
government's
objective.
it
is
the
government's
results
they
are
seeking
to
obtain.
and
they've
conscripted
voluntarily
the
industry
to
do
the
thing
for
it
and
then
it
calls
it
its
official
results.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
think
that
what,
what
the
ftc
was
able
to
accomplish
at
that
time
was
to
get
every...
the
major
players
in
the
marketplace
with
respect
to
participation
in
this.
i
don't
know--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
the
private
hospital
example
that
we
were
talking
about.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
stronger.
why
would
it
be
weaker--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
happens
to
be...
there
happens
to
be
a
coincidence
of
what
the
government
wants
to
accomplish
and
what
the
industry
is
willing
to
and
wants
to
accomplish.
i'll
accept
that.
so
does
that
mean
there's
an
exception
to
the
federal
officer
removal
statute,
if
the
person
who
is
asked
to
help
the
government,
does
help
the
government,
is
sued
because
his
actions
in
helping
the
government
occasioned
someone
to
bring
a
law
suit?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place
if
there's
anything
in
the
complaint
that
allows
a
removal
then
the
case
can
be
removed.
that's
the
exxon
versus
allapattah
case
that
the
court
decided
just
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
but
secondly,
let
me
address
directly
what
you
are
saying.
throughout
the
complaint,
in
the
complaint
itself,
i
found
references
to
the
testing
machine
or
method
eight
times
in
the
complaint.
they
say...
they
complain
about
representations
that
cigarettes
contain
less
tar
and
nicotine
than
regular
cigarettes.
they
base
that
on
the
test
results.
they
then
say
as
measured
by
the
industry
standard
testing
apparatus.
and
let
me
refer
to
what
the
petitioners
said
in
their
motion
to
remand
to
the
state
court.
they
complained...
they
said
the
basis
of
this
complaint
is
misleading
low
tar
and
nicotine
ratings
as
measured
by
the
company's
testing
procedures.
that's
in
the
petitioners'
motion
to
remand.
furthermore,
the
district
court
interpreted
the
complaint
precisely
the
way
we
are
explaining
this
to
the
court
today.
the
district
court
said
that
over
and
over
again,
words
of
the
district
court
at
page
42a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court
concludes
that
the
ftc's
regulation
of
the
cigarette
companies'
testing
and
advertising
cuts
to
the
heart
of
the
plaintiff's
lawsuit.
well,
the
heart
of
the
plaintiff's
lawsuit
is
testing
and
advertising.
the
testing
is
required
by
the
ftc.
the
results
of
the
testings
are
the
ftc's
numbers.
and
the
advertising
contains
the
ftc's
numbers
because
the
ftc
requires
it.
the
circuit
court
interpreted--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
deny
that
the...
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
engaged
in
industry.
a
regulated
industry
by
the
ftc.
and
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
there's
an
exception.
and
the
government
hasn't
suggested
there's
an
exception
in
the
federal
officer
removal
statute
because
someone
happens
to
be
in
the
industry
which
is
asked
to
help
the
government
perform
a
particular
function.
there
is
no
logic
to
that,
and
it
certainly
would
be
not
a
liberal
interpretation
of
the
federal
officer
removal
statute.
the
circuit
court
also
said
the
very...
and
i
think
this
is
worth
noting,
at
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
the
very
combination
the
plaintiff
challenges
as
deceptive
is
the
same
combination
the
ftc
requires
not
to
be...
to
put
in
your
advertising
in
order
not
to
be
deceptive.
so
what
is
required
by
the
ftc
of
the
plaintiffs,
the
advertising
of
these
test...
official
test
results...
is
precisely
what
the
petitioners
say,
and
the
petitioners
say
is
deceptive.
that's
the
basis
for
their
lawsuit.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
is
a
good
preemption
argument,
justice
scalia.
that
will
be
played
out
either
in
the
state
court,
depending
upon
how
you
rule,
or
the
federal
court.
but
it's...
that's
the
nexus
and
the
color
of
federal
authority
that
you
talked
about
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
that
acker
case.
the
court
in
the
acker
case,
jefferson
county
versus
acker,
said
that
the
allegations
in
the
petition
and
in
the
removal
petition
must
be...
and
especially
since
they
weren't
challenged
in
this
case,
the
factual
allegations
and
the
characterization
of
the
complaint
were
not
challenged
in
this
case...
must
be
accepted
as
true
by
this
court.
and
chief
justice
roberts,
it's
not
only
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
the
characterization
in
the
removal
petition,
but
it's
what
the
district
court
decided
the
complaint
said.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
is.
and
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
evaluation
of
the
conduct
of
the
person
acting--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
yes.
there
is.
but
as
i
said,
that
is
not...
i
mean,
the
part
of
the
complaint,
as
the
district
court
saw
it
and
the
circuit
court
saw
it,
is
much
more
than
that.
it's
the
testing
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
because
even
if
there's
an
allegation,
which
there
is
in
the
complaint,
that
the
test
was
manipulated
or
gained
or
circumvented,
it
goes
back
to
whether
it's
a
good
test
or
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
may
perhaps
be.
but
what,
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that
anyway,
chief
justice
roberts,
because
it's
clear
that
what
was
being
done
here
is
something
that
the
ftc
wanted
done
in
the
way
the
ftc
wanted
it
done.
i
don't
know
how
the...
i
believe
that
the
preemption
argument
is
very,
very
strong,
because
the
lawsuit,
the
substance,
the
guts,
the
core,
the
heart
of
the
lawsuit,
as
the
district
court
said
and
the
eighth
circuit
said
is,
you're
doing
what
the
ftc
required
you
to
do,
and
the
plaintiffs
say
that
it's
deceptive.
and
by
the
way,
it's
very
clear
from
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix
and
in
the
district
court
decision
and
in
the
remand
in
the
motion...
the
motion
to...
the
petition
to
remove,
that
the
ftc
knew
exactly
the
deficiencies
that
are
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
ftc
has
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
people
smoke
differently,
that
cigarette...
the
design
of
a
cigarette
may
affect
the
outcome
of
the
test.
but
what
the
ftc,
knowing
that
full
well,
said,
well,
people
might
smoke
things
differently
and
you
might
get
more
tar
and
nicotine
than
the
ftc
ratings
produce.
and
the
ftc
with
full
awareness
said,
we
understand
all
that,
but
what
we
want
is
for
the
consumers
to
have
an
ability
to
compare
this
cigarette
with
this
cigarette,
and
we
have
devised
a
test
that
will
allow
you
to
compare
an
apple
to
an
apple.
now
there
are
other
things
that
will--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
the
case.
i
don't
know
if
you've
charactered
it
the
same
way
i
did,
but
the
apples
to
apples
thing
is
tied
in
with
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
about
the
apple
inspectors.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
the
tobacco
institute
testing
facility--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
a
facility
of
the
tobacco
industry.
the
ftc
perceives
it
as...
these
industries...
and
these
companies,
and
as
i
said,
even
the
petitioners
in
their
remand
petition
are
challenging
the
low
tar
and
nicotine
rate
measured
by
the
company's
testing
procedures.
so
yes,
i'd
like
to
have
it
be
something
different
but
it
isn't
something
different.
it
is
what
the
companies
have
done,
and
through
this
mechanism.
this
case
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
the
ftc
wanted
certain
things
done.
it
decided
how
certain
things
would
be
done.
it
calls
the
results
of
those
the
official
ftc
ratings.
it
wants
those
ratings
delivered
to
the
people.
and
the
tobacco
companies
have
done
that
and
they're
being
sued
because
they
say...
because
that
information
which
they're
delivering,
that
they're
creating
and
delivering
at
the
request
of
the
government,
is
alleged
to
be
deceptive.
this
is
the
perfect
case
for
a
removal
under
the
federal
officer
removal
statute.
