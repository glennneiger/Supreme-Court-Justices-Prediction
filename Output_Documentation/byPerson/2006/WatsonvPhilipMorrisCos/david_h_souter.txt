did
the
ftc
ever
adopt
a
regulation
saying
you've
got
publish
these
measurements?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
one
of
the
companies
had
said,
we're
sick
of
doing
this,
we
don't
like
the
numbers
we're
getting,
whatever,
we're
just
not
going
to
do
it,
presumably
if
we,
you
know,
accept
that
testimony
at
face
value,
the
ftc
would
have
moved
and
said,
okay,
i
guess
we're
going
to
have
to
have
a
reg
or
a
statute
or
what-not.
during
that
period
of
time,
the
company
wouldn't
be
committing
any
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
this...
i'm
just
not
following
it.
what
is
the
source
of
the
so-called
ftc
number>
["]
to
which
advertising
must
conform?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
cambridge
test,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
that.
but
if
the...
if
a
given
cigarette
manufacturer
simply
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
any
numbers,
we're
simply
going
to
say
ftc
wanted
numbers
and
they
wanted
the
numbers
in
accordance
with
the
cambridge
testing
method,
they
would
then
have
had
to
regulate,
adopt
a
regulation,
or
get
congress
to
pass
a
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
in
my
hypo
they
just
say:
look,
we're
just
going
to
say
"smoke
marlboros".
we're
not
going
to
say
the
nicotine
is
low
or
anything.
the
ftc
would
not
at
that
point
have
any
basis
to
charge
a
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
i'm
getting
at
is
the
ftc
had
no
basis
other
than
a
voluntary
agreement
to
require
them
to
publish
any
numbers
or
to
publish
any
numbers
in
accordance
with
the
cambridge--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
in
your
hypo
the
government
came
along
and
said,
in
order
to
run
your
hospital,
you've
got
to
disclose
certain
facts.
otherwise
we're
going
to
shut
it
down.
and
those
facts
from
that
point
on
are
like
your
hypo.
would
your
conclusion
then
follow,
that
they
were
acting
under?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
that
the
situation
that
we've
got
here?
