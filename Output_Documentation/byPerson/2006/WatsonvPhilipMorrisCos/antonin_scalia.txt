justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
cite
any
particular
document
or
statement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
constitutes
the
delegation?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
all
these
contracting
cases
involve
the
contractor
imposing
law
upon
somebody,
executing
law?
on
behalf
of
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
your
test.
i
mean,
and
if
that
is
the
proper
test,
it
ought
to
apply
in
the
government
contractor
situation,
too.
so,
for
example,
the
government
can
hire
a
private
company
run
prisons;
but
that
would
be
the
government
hiring
somebody
to
perform
government...
government
functions.
now,
do
all
of
those...
a
function
that
remain
as
government
function,
keeping
the
incarcerated
incarcerated.
now
do,
do
all
of
the
contract
cases
involve
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
puts
a
whole
new
theory
on
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
was
acting
under
color
of
law
as
you've
described
that
in
your
petitions?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i,
i
it
seems
to
me
color
of
office,
you
say
color
of
office,
it
means
that
its
appearance
to
somebody
else
is
that...
that
he
is
being
an
official.
and
i
would
think
that
that
requires
the
fact
that
he's
assisting
a
government
agent
in
enforcing
the
law
against
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
out
of
curiosity,
what,
what
happens
to
the,
the
employees
of
the
private
companies
that
run
prisons?
could
they
removed
under
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
either
run
the
prison
for
a
state,
or
for
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
test
here?
if
it
is
state
action,
it
is
covered
by
this
statute.
if
it
isn't,
it
is
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suppose
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
should
i
conclude
it
therefore
is
not
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
test
their
products
before
they're
marketed
under
rigid
federal
testing
regulations
which
are
supervised
by
the
federal
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
government
supervising
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
is
there
some
government
official
who's
there
to
make
sure
that
the
testing
is
being
done
the
way,
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be,
which
is
what,
what
is
argued
is
the
case
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
be
there
every
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
policing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
have
a
contract
to
provides
food
to
the
senate
cafeteria,
okay.
and
the
senate
or
maybe
the
executive
branch,
for
that
matter,
closely
supervises
my
preparation
and
service
of
that
food.
am
i
acting
under,
even
though
i'm
not
assisting
the
government
in
any
governmental
function
at
all?
don't
you
have
to
be
assisting
in
the
performance
of
a
governmental
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
called
ftc
ratings?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
are
called...
in
the
regulations
it's
called
the
ftc
test,
even
after
it
has
been
done
by
the
companies?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
careless,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
have,
have
they
imposed
its
official...
has
it
imposed,
the
ftc,
its
official
results
on
any
company
that
was
not
a
participant
in
this...
in
this
testing
lab?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
case
would
be
stronger
if
they
weren't
doing
it
just
for
themselves.
if
in
fact
that
they
were
doing
it
for
the
ftc
who
imposed
it
even
on
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
here
you're
doing
it
for
yourself.
you
want
to
advertise
low...
low...
low
tar
cases.
and
the
ftc
says
the
only
way
we'll
let
you
do
it,
the
only
way
we'll
let
do
you
that
advertising
is
if
you
test
them
pursuant
to
this,
this
system
that
we
established.
and
you
say
okay.
we'll
test
them
pursuant
to
the
system
you've
established
and...
and
everybody
goes
happily
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that's
a
good,
that's
a
good
preemption
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it
has
much
bearing
upon
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
all
comes
back
to
me
now,
that
case
you
mentioned.
lip
drape,
that
was
the
lip
drape
case,
wasn't
it,
where
people
smoke
differently
because
some
of
them
cover
up
the
holes
in
the
filter
when
their
lips...
the
lip
drape.
the
naked
lip
drape.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
many
others
involve
the
agency
calling
the
result
of
the
private
action
the
ftc
figures
and
the
ftc
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't...
they
don't
put
it
out
to
the
public
as
the
federal
government's
figures.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
don't
call
it
the
government's
test.
don't
call
it
the
government's
figures.
call
it
the
industry's
figures.
