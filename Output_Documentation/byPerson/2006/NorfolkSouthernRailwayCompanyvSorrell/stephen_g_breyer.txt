justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
we're
supposed
to
decide
the
case,
in
your
view,
there
was
instruction
13.
instruction
13
used
the
word
direct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
object
to
13.
you
said
it
should
use
the
word
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
then
argued
to
the
lower
courts,
13
should
use
the
word
in
whole
or
in
part.
and
then
you
say
you've
argued
that
here.
so
what
you're
saying
is
now
we're
supposed
to
decide,
should
instruction
13
use
the
word
in
whole
or
in
part.
that's
what
it
is.
i
have
to
admit,
i
didn't
quite
get
that
out
of
the
blue
brief.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
something
else
about
railroad
negligence.
but
you're
not
now,
you
say,
arguing
about
railroad
negligence.
you're
arguing
about
plaintiff
negligence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
i
reread
the
blue
brief,
what
i'll
discover
on
closer
examination,
that
your
real
objection,
not
responding
to
the
other
side,
has
simply
been
about
the
standard
to
use
in
respect
to
plaintiff's
contributory
negligence.
and
what
you
want
this
court
to
say
is,
you're
right
about
that,
we
want
the
more
relaxed
standard
used
for
contributory
negligence.
end
of
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
that
in
the
blue
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
it
sure
is
before
the
court,
because
what
we
are
considering
before
the
court
is
your
objection
to
instruction
13.
and
you
said
it
should
use
the
words
in
whole
or
in
part.
and
i
have
to
admit,
i
don't
know
why
it
shouldn't.
but
i'll
have
to
ask
them
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
to
say
yes.
so
all
this
other
stuff
is
quite
extraneous
about
whether...
the
railroad
standard
of
negligence,
the
railroad
should
be
in
a
relaxed
standard
of
negligence,
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
causation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
i'm
seeing
now,
i
think
the
structure
of
your
brief
is...
perhaps
a
gloss
put
on
it,
but
saying
this:
look,
we
objected
to
the
contributory
negligence
instruction
on
the
ground
that
it
couldn't
be
different
from
the
direct
instruction...
from
the
railroad
instruction.
and
we
said
they
should
be
the
same
and
they
should
both
be
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
now
want
you
to
say
that
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
do
that
was
wrong,
because
it
violated
the
equivalence.
but
as
soon
as
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
have
to
think
about
what
the
right
standard
should
be
for
a
new
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
stop
there,
probably,
they
will
put
the
in
whole
or
in
part,
but
that's
not
the
right
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
really
think
about
it,
you
will
see
that
the
one
we
didn't
ask
for,
but
the
one
that
the
court
gave,
is
the
right
standard
and
should
have
been
given
in
the
other
case,
too.
now,
we
wouldn't
have
to
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
saying
unless
you
say
that,
you're
not
going
to
give
proper
instruction
to
what
happens
in
the
future.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now
let's
think
back
for
a
minute
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
it
be
wrong?
how
could
it
be
wrong
to
have
instructed
the
jury
with
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
for
the
railroad,
since
that's
the
language
of
the
statute
itself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
possible...
you
have
two
sides.
one,
you
write
a
proximate
cause
instruction
in
whatever
language
you
like.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
side
submits
a
proposed
instruction
with
in
whole
or
in
part.
i'm
a
trial
judge.
i've
never
heard
of
this
case,
kind
of
case
before.
i
just
was
appointed.
i
read
the
statute.
and
i
say,
well,
here,
theirs
says
what
the
statute
says,
and
yours
doesn't.
i'll
play
it
safe.
i'll
go
with
the
statute.
all
right?
now,
how
could
that
be
an
error?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
what
the
statute
said
it
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
they
want
to
make
the
argument
now,
whether
they
did
or
not,
that
if
we
look
at
section
53,
which
i
think
is
the
part
dealing
with
contributory
negligence.
i
don't
see
anything
else.
it
doesn't
speak
of
causation
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
just
says
if
there's
some
contributory
negligence,
the
damages
will
be
diminished
according
to
the
negligence
attributable
to
the
employee.
so
i
take
it
their
argument
was,
maybe
with
hindsight,
judge,
don't
give
this
direct
language,
because
nothing
requires
it.
and
since,
other
things
being
equal,
nothing
requires
it,
you
ought
to
give
the
same
language
you
gave
for
the
other
side.
and
they
said
the
judge
rejected
that
argument,
so
now
they
tell
us,
well,
that
was
wrong,
he
should
have
accepted
it.
and
all
the
rest
of
what
he's
saying
is
just
in
case
the
court
wants
to
reach
it,
or
something
like
that.
but
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
should
we
answer
the
question
he
now...
perhaps
in
his
minimalist
position...
might
want
to
raise,
or
maybe
did,
that
section
53
doesn't
speak
of
causation,
the
judge
gave
a
causation
instruction.
the
judge's
causation
instruction
in
their
view
was
wrong,
and
the
law
requires
the
judge's
causation
instruction
on
contributory
negligence,
if
there
is
one,
to
be
the
same
as
it
was
on
direct,
the
defendant's
negligence.
and
he
says
that
isn't
what
happened,
we
objected
to
it,
we
produced
arguments,
one
of
them
was
this
equivalence
thing.
so
he's
saying
to
us:
decide
it,
say
that
they
were
wrong.
what's
your
view
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
surprised.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that's
just
an
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
not,
but
they
say,
nonetheless,
we
did
object
that
this
instruction
was
wrong.
one
reason
it
was
wrong
is
because
it
speaks
of
causation
differently
than
when
they
spoke
of
causation
in
respect
to
the
railroad.
we
thought
that
was
a
reason
why
it
was
wrong
then.
we
think
that's
a
reason
why
it
is
wrong
now,
and
we
would
like
the
missouri
court,
but
they
wouldn't
do
it,
so
we
want
you
to
say
it
was
wrong
for
that
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
we
say,
well,
we'll
abandon
all
that,
that's
just
a
series
of
different
arguments
that
we'd
like
the
court
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
read
it
carefully,
you'll
see
it,
basically.
[laughter]
