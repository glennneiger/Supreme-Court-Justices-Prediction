chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
norfolk
southern
railway
versus
sorrell.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips,
i
may
be
lost
a
bit
here.
but
i
mean,
which...
i'm
looking
at
the
instructions
that
were
given.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
is
hard
to
take
issue
with
the
instruction
on
the
railroad's
part
because
it
tracks
the
statutory
language.
the
statute
says
in
whole
or
in
part,
and
the
instruction
says
in
whole
or
in
part.
so
if
you're
pushing
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
your
objection
seems
to
be
to
the
directly
contributed
language
with
respect
to
the
employee,
the
plaintiff.
now,
but
doesn't
directly
contributed,
isn't
that
a
typical
proximate
cause
instruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
on
the
other
hand,
you're
also
arguing
in
favor
of
proximate
cause.
you
are
saying
rogers
didn't
change
proximate
cause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
have
us
announce
a
decision
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
without
saying
which
way
it
should
be
made
equivalent?
raising
the
railroad's
standard
or
lowering
the
employee's?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
perry?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
doctrine
of
equivalence
when
you're
running
a
comparative
negligence
regime?
because,
you
know,
you
talk
about
the
plaintiff's
negligence
causing
the
harm
to
a
certain
degree
and
the
defendant's
negligence
causing
it
to
a
certain
degree.
and
if
you're
not
dealing
with
apples
and
apples,
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
conduct
the
comparison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
we're
talking
about
comparative
negligence
here,
where
there's
negligence
on
both
sides.
and
i
just
don't
know
how
you
say
one
party's
20
percent...
contributed
20
percent
to
the
harm
and
the
other
80
percent,
if
you're
using
different
causation
standards.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
any
conceptual
difficulty
with
adding
in
whole
or
in
part
to
instruction
13,
which
is
the
employee's
instruction,
because
it's
comparative
negligence.
it
seems
to
me
that
necessarily
implies
in
whole
or
in
part.
if
you
can
reduce
his
recovery
because
he's
in
part
negligent,
what
would
be
wrong
with
saying
in
whole
or
in
part
in
instruction
13?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
thought
justice
souter's
point
was
that
taking
it
out
of
the
railroad's
instruction
might
cause
confusion
because
of
it.
but
i
don't
see
how
adding
it
to
both
of
them
when
you're
dealing
with
comparative
negligence,
and
it's
necessarily
the
case
that
partial
negligence
on
either
of
their
parts
can
enter
into
the
verdict,
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
confusing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
answer
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
that
scenario,
then,
what
objection
could
there
be
to
a
recognition
that
the
negligence
of
the
plaintiff
can
contribute
in
part
to
the
accident?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
what
justice
souter
has
identified,
right?
that's
not
because
they're
adopting
different
standards.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
just
told
me,
a
good
reason
for
not
putting
in
whole
or
in
part
in
instruction
13
is
because
it
doesn't
make
sense,
the
whole
part
doesn't
make
sense
with
contributory
negligence.
that's
a
good
reason
not
to
put
it
in
section
53
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
say
that.
i
mean,
you
know,
when
in
doubt,
we
ought
to
follow
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
so
whole
or
in
part
makes
sense
with
the
railroad,
but
directly
doesn't
appear
in
section
53.
why
don't
we
just...
why
shouldn't
the
instruction
just
say,
"such
negligence
of
the
plaintiff
contributed
to
cause
his
injury.
"
it's
not
going
to
be
a
complete
bar
because
we
know
the
immediate...
the
next
instruction
talks
about
reducing
the
award
by
the
amount
of
the
negligence.
why
wouldn't
that
be
preferable
to
introducing
extraneous
terms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
but
he
requested
that
the
instructions
be
the
same,
and
the
directly
is
what
causes
the
problem,
and
directly
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
they
raised
an
objection
based
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
rogers
might
have
said,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
slight
cause.
it
only
says
in
whole
or
in
part.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
"in
whole
or
in
part"
simply
the
logical
corollary
of
introducing
comparative
negligence?
why
do
you
have
to
read
that
as
departing
from
proximate
cause,
instead
of
simply
recognizing
that
under
53,
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employee
can
reduce
recovery
which...
without
barring
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
why
you
don't
have
53,
not
because
they
wanted
to
depart
from
proximate
cause
there,
but
because,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
you
wouldn't
have
it
in
whole
or
in
part.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
perry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

mr.
phillips,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
case
number
05-746,
norfolk
southern
railway
company
versus
sorrell.
timothy
sorrell
was
injured
while
working
for
norfolk
southern
a
railroad
and
he
sued
norfolk
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
(fela)
makes
railroads
liable
to
their
employees
for
injuries
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
norfolk
claimed
that
sorrell’s
own
negligence
was
the
cause
of
his
injuries.
fela
does
not
bar
relief
if
the
employee
is
also
negligent
but
instead
reduces
damages
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
negligence
attributable
to
the
employee.
sorrell
was
awarded
$1.5
million
in
damages
by
a
jury
but
norfolk
objected
to
the
instructions
given
to
the
jury
on
the
ground
that
they
contain
different
causation
standards
for
railroad
negligence
and
employee
contributory
negligence.
missouri
is
apparently
the
only
state
to
employ
different
causations
standards
under
fela
and
norfolk
argued
that
the
standard
should
be
the
same
under
the
act
regardless
of
whether
you
are
considering
railroad
or
employee
negligence.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
agree
that
common-law
the
same
standard
of
causation
was
used
for
both
negligence
and
contributory
negligence.
nowhere
in
the
statute
is
there
any
suggestion
that
fela
meant
to
depart
from
this
common-law
practice
and
it
would
be
strange
to
apply
different
standards
of
causation
to
each
party’s
negligence
when
under
the
act
the
negligence
of
the
parties
must
be
compared
by
the
jury
to
determine
damages.
we
conclude
that
the
act
does
not
abrogate
the
common-law
approach
and
that
the
same
standard
of
causation
applies
to
railroad
negligence
as
the
plaintiff’s
contributory
negligence.
in
briefing
ended
argument
norfolk
asked
us
to
decide
what
that
causation
standard
should
be
but
when
it
petition
for
certiorari,
when
it
asked
us
to
review
the
case
it
only
raised
the
issue
of
whether
the
standard
should
be
the
same.
that’s
the
only
issue
on
which
we
granted
review
and
it’s
the
only
one
we
are
going
to
decide.
sorrell
maintains
that
even
if
the
jury
instructions
were
improper
any
error
was
harmless
because
the
evidence
of
his
negligence
presented
a
trial
could
not
lead
to
a
different
result
even
with
corrected
instructions.
we
leave
that
issue
to
the
state
court
on
remand
to
consider.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justices
scalia
and
alito
have
joined.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
