mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
common
law
doctrine
of
equivalence
between
defendant
negligence
and
plaintiff
negligence
applies
under
the
fela.
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is,
i
think,
most
clearly
stated
in
the
restatement
(second)
of
torts,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
19
of
our
blue
brief
in
the
middle
paragraph.
and
i
think
it
is
worth
taking
a
second
to
read
it.
the
rules
which
determine
the
causal
relation
between
a
plaintiff's
negligent
conduct
and
the
harm
resulting
to
him
are
the
same
as
those
determining
the
causal
relation
between
the
defendant's
negligent
conduct
and
resulting
harm
to
others.
that
is
a
principle
of
law
that
has
been
in
effect
long
before
the
federal
employers
liability
act
was
enacted.
it
is
obviously
a
restatement
of
the
law
in
1965,
and
it
is
an
absolutely
clear
statement
of
the
law
as
it
applies
today.
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
employers
liability
act
that
remotely
modifies
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
the
two
provisions,
section
51
talks
about
negligence
resulting
from...
or
negligence
in
whole
or
in
part.
and
section
53,
which
describes
the
contributory
negligence
portion
or
comparative
negligence
talks
about
negligence
attributable
to.
none
of
that
deviates
at
all
from
any
kind
of
common
law
doctrines.
negligence
inherently
calls
for
an
analysis
of
proximate
causation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
even
if
that
were
true,
we
would
still,
of
course,
be
entitled
to...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
change
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
it
doesn't
say
that
we're
not
entitled
to
the
same
rule
with
respect
to
the...
our
clients--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
plaintiff
would
be.
that
doctrine
is
unaffected
by
that
holding.
now,
i'd
like
to
take
issue
with
the
interpretation
of
rogers,
if
you
want,
at
this
point.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
doctrine
of
proximate
causation.
and
therefore,
you
can
change
one
without
affecting
the
other
one
whatsoever.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
not
our
attack,
justice
ginsburg.
our
objection,
which
is
reproduced
in
28a
of
the
cert...
of
the
petition's
appendix,
that
says...
and
i
think
the
current
mai
instruction
has
a
different
causation
standard
for
comparative
fault,
meaning
that
under
missouri's
rules,
we
must
prove
that
such
negligence
of
plaintiff
directly
contributed
to
the
cause...
to
cause
the
injury.
and
that
misstates
the
law,
because
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
that's
our
initial
argument,
is
that
no
matter
how
you
analyze
this,
whether
you
do
it
from
a
proximate
cause
or
a
slightest
cause
standard
as
the
appropriate
way
to
evaluate
our
negligence,
that
same
standard
has
to
be
applied
in
evaluating
the
plaintiff's
negligence.
that's
the
core
doctrine.
that's
what
we
sought
certiorari
on.
the
argument
with
respect
to
rogers
was
not
an
argument
we
put
into
this
case,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
an
argument
that
the
respondent
put
into
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
would
regard
that
as
certainly
at
least
half
a
loaf,
maybe
more
than
half
a
loaf.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
think
the
right
answer
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
ought
to
go
ahead
and
decide
whether
or
not
rogers
really
did
work
a
sea
change
in
the
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
wouldn't
have
to
address
that
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely
don't
have
to
address
that
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
is
squarely
presented.
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
clearly
did
that,
justice
kennedy.
and
we
didn't
raise...
we
are
not
here
complaining
about
rogers
as
an
argument
for
why
we
shouldn't
be
liable.
that's
not
our...
we're
not
criticizing
that.
what
we're
saying
is,
in
response
to
the
respondent's
argument
which
seeks
to
undermine
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
based
on
an
overreading,
i
would
argue,
of
rogers,
that
that
interpretation
is
incorrect.
and
if
we're
right
that
that
interpretation
is
incorrect,
we
would
win
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
for
two
different
reasons.
the
first
one
that
justice
souter
described.
and
the
second
one
would
be
that
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
equivalence,
there's
no
problem
here
because
proximate
cause
is
required
in
every
case.
and
we
think
that
that's
an
issue
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide,
but
certainly
could.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
what
we're
saying,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
same...
if
they
were
going
to
use
slight
negligence
with
respect
to
our
negligence,
then
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff's
negligence,
we
were
entitled
to
slight
negligence
as
well.
that's
our
fundamental
argument.
that's
the
issue
we
have
put
on
the
table.
and
candidly,
i
don't
think
there's
an
answer
to
that
that's
been
offered
in
this
case,
other
than
a
harmless
error
argument,
which
i
think
is
candidly
without
substance.
the
issue,
then,
is
whether
in
evaluating
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
do
you
want
to
then
entertain
the
plaintiff's
or
the
respondent's
counter
argument,
which
is
that
somehow
rogers
requires
this
fundamental
change,
and
indeed
overrules
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
as
it
applies
to
fela.
and
i
would
say,
one,
rogers
doesn't
speak
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
at
all.
and,
two,
to
the
extent
it
does
speak
to
it,
it
was
never
meant
to
change
the
fundamental
rule
with
respect
to
proximate
causation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
at
least
one
circuit
clearly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the...
well,
the
answer
is
yes,
of
course,
i
expect
to
get
five
votes
for
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
you
know,
the
basic...
the
point
here
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
that
have
analyzed
this
court's
opinion
in
rogers,
i
don't
think
any
of
them
has
analyzed
it
with
much
care.
and
the
reality
is
the
third
circuit
has
analyzed
this
case
with
care,
and
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
we
think
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits.
and
at
some
point,
if
not
through
this
vehicle
to
address
that
issue,
then
through
another
vehicle
to
address
that
issue.
but,
yes,
it
seems
reasonably
clear
that,
first
of
all,
there
were
at
least
20
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
not
only
with
the
sufficiency
evidence,
but
also
with
the
adequacy
of
the
jury
instructions
prior
to
rogers
that
refer
specifically
to
proximate
causation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
remotely
meant
to
change
that.
there
is
nothing
that's
been
identified
in
that
context.
it
is
at
least
clear
to
me,
and
i
hope
clear
to
five
of
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
what
rogers
saying
in
whole
or
in
part
eliminated
was
the
specific
proximate
causation
standard
existing
in
missouri.
and
missouri's
proximate
cause
standard
talked
about
sole
causation.
and
this
court
said,
no,
in
whole
or
in
part
means
sole
causation
can
not
be
the
right
standard
for
proximate
cause.
the
court
was
not
asked
to
decide,
and
i
don't
think
it
did
decide,
that
proximate
causation,
as
it
is
traditionally
understood,
was
also
thrown
out
the
door,
or
more
fundamentally,
that
you
can
never
ask
for
a
jury
instruction
that
calls
for
proximate
causation
to
be
given
to
both
parties...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that
is
a
typical
proximate
cause
instruction,
and
that
meant
that
our
burden
was
heavier
than
the
plaintiff's
burden,
which
is
why
we're
saying
that
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
we're
entitled
to
the
equivalent
instructions.
whatever
they
are.
if
it
is
slight
cause
or
proximate
cause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
we
are
only
doing
that
in
response
to
the
respondent's
argument.
i'm
not...
we
didn't
bring
to
this
court
an
affirmative
argument
that
said
we
are
entitled
to
no
liability
because
of
proximate
cause.
that's
not
the
argument
we
made.
the
argument--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
if
you
look
at
the
opposition
to
the
cert
petition,
which
took
us
to
task
for
not
discussing
rogers
in
our
petition,
it
says
on
page
6,
"inexplicably,
petitioner
does
not
cite,
let
alone
discuss
rogers,
an
omission
that
enfeebles
its
entire
discussion
of
fela's
causation
standards.
"
against
that
kind
of
an
attack,
we
felt
it
incumbent
on
us
to
deal
with
rogers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
we're
arguing
both.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it
does
say
that
in
the
blue
brief.
because
what
we
say
is
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is
the
principle
that
should
apply.
and
you
know,
it
is
not
specifically
before
the
court
whether
that
means
slight
cause
or
proximate
cause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
fair.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
that
it's
extraneous.
it
clearly
is
not
something
that
the
court
needs
to
decide.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
something
that
the
respondents,
to
my
mind
at
least,
put
into
the
case.
and
then
we
responded,
to
be
sure,
somewhat
aggressively
in
urging
the
court
to
rethink
whether
rogers
was
right...
whether
rogers
really
decided
this
issue
as
some
courts
of
appeals
have.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
no
question
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
point
is
that
we
made
both
arguments.
and
they
are
in
some
ways
intertwined,
in
part
because
so
much
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
itself
is
based
on
proximate
cause
as
the
standard.
and
so
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
the
common
law
analyses
here,
which
are
the
predicate--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--except
to
the
extent
that
the
respondents
are
asking
you
to
interpret
rogers
as
a
mechanism
for
getting
at
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
now,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
answer
that
in
one
of
two
ways.
you
can
say
simply,
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia,
rogers
doesn't
speak
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
entertain
that,
you
should
just
reaffirm
a
doctrine
that
every
court
except
the
courts
in
missouri
have
recognized
for
a
very
long
time.
or
alternatively,
you
can
say,
well,
look,
they
say
that
in
order
to
properly
analyze
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
you
should
examine
whether
or
not
rogers
worked
a
sea
change
in
the
law.
and
we
took
them
up
on
that
argument,
and
said,
we
don't
think
it
did.
and
that
if
it
didn't
work
a
sea
change
in
the
law,
then
there
is
no
basis
at
all
for
doubting
that
you
would
grant
equivalent
instructions
in
these
two
cases.
and
that's
the
guidance
you
would
give
to
the
lower
courts
on
remand.
because
this
case
would
have
to
go
back
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
you
know,
justice
kennedy,
i
understand
that.
but
the
reality
is
we
raised
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
as
our
question
presented.
the
other
side
raises
and
uses
a
substantial
amount
of
its
pages
for
the
issue
of
the
meaning
of
rogers.
we
answer
that
in
the
reply
brief.
the
court
grants
certiorari.
we
decided
under
those
circumstances
that
the
sensible
way
to
proceed
was
to
address
the
rogers
issue.
now,
to
be
sure,
i
suppose
we
could
have
said,
here's...
section
one
is
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
that's
a
10
page
brief.
maybe
the
better
way
to
do
it
is
just
write
a
15
page
brief,
wait
for
their
47
page
brief
on
rogers,
and
then
20
pages
on
rogers.
but
we
anticipated
that
they
were
going
to
do
precisely
what
they
did,
which
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
because...
courts
of
appeals
have
been
doing
that
for
years.
there
have
been
a
lot...
you
know,
a
lot
of
them
assume
that
there's
a
lower
standard,
and
they
say
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
requires
that
if
the
plaintiff
gets
to
go
with
slight
cause,
then
the
defendant
gets
slight
cause.
so
that's
a
ruling
that's
been
rendered
for
years
and
years.
is
that
the
most
sensible
way?
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
would
make
sense
for
this
court
to
address
the
more
fundamental
issue
of
rogers.
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
issue
that
needs
to
be
decided.
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
decide
it.
i
do
think
it
has
been
thoroughly
vetted
for
the
court
on
both
sides,
and
it
would
certainly
provide
significant
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
let
me
take
the
first
question
first,
and
then
i'll
address
the
second
one.
there
were
three
theories
that
the
plaintiff
put
forward
of
the
negligence
of
the
railroad.
not
just
that
the
one
driver
drove
the
other
driver
off
the
side
of
the
road.
there
was
also
a
claim
that
the
road
wasn't
constructed
properly,
and
there
was
a
claim
that
he
wasn't
given
adequate
safety
instructions.
and
there's
no
way,
given
that
this
was
a
general
verdict,
to
remotely
figure
out
which
of
those
theories
was
the
one
the
jury
thought
was
correct,
and
how
that
theory
might
line
up
with
a
causation
theory,
based
on
the
plaintiff's
own
particular
view
and
the
defendant's
arguments
in
this
particular
case.
so
it
is
not
as
cut
and
dried
as
he
said,
he
said,
and
that's
it.
they
were
more
theories
in
it.
and
you
know,
if
you
accept
the
idea
that
jury
instructions
count,
and
there's
clearly
a
very
different
burden
that's
imposed
on
one
as
opposed
to
the
other,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
there's
no
way
for
the
court
to
make
a
harmless
error
determination.
it
is
also
a
question
of
state
law.
it
ought
to
be
decided
by
the
missouri
courts
in
the
first
instance
in
any
event,
i
would
think,
rather
than
this
court
trying
to
sort
through
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
argument
at
the
close
of
the
case,
i
don't
remember
any
specific
arguments
that
either
side
made
with
respect
to
the
burdens,
because
the
jury
instructions
were
what
they
were.
and
i
think
each
side
was
saying,
you
know,
we
really
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
and
so
that's
basically
the
way
that
it
was
presented.
but
i
think
given
the
way
the
jury
instructions
played
out,
that
there's
no
way
at
this
time
to
unscramble
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
know,
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
if
we
were
entitled
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
and
if
the
issue
was
what's
the
proper
instruction,
we
would
have
asked
for
and
we
should
have
properly
received
a
proximate
cause
instruction.
and
that's
what...
that's
the
question
that
will
be
at
issue
on
the
remand.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
is
the
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
it
doesn't
adequately
explain
to
the
jury
what
decisionmaking
it
has
to
go
through
in
order
to
evaluate
this
case.
i
mean,
it
is
true,
it
is
not
an
incorrect
statement
in
the
sense
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
but
it
is
not
an
adequate
statement
because
it
doesn't
deal,
it
is
not
sufficient,
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
proximate
cause
issue.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
it
is
wrong
on
two
levels.
one
is,
i
don't
know
why
you
would
need
to
have
proximate
cause
as
your
fallback,
the
last
comment
you
just
made,
because
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
saying
slight
cause,
which
is
what
missouri
thinks
the
in
whole
or
in
part
means,
then
you
can
just
say
slight
cause
when
you're
describing
the
contributory
negligence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
we
asked
for
was
an
equivalence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
the
judge
rejected
it.
he
didn't
reject
it
on
the
basis--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
point
here
that
remains
is
we
said
we
are
entitled
to
an
equivalent
instruction.
now,
if
there's
some
variant
of
that,
we
could
certainly
argue
about
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
is
the
specific
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
that's
our
argument.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well...
i
think...
i
think
the
argument
would
be
that
that
cuts
it
too
fine,
candidly.
i
think
you
can
make
an
argument
that
what,
you
know,
what
we
were
entitled
to
was
some
variant.
and
that...
our
objection
here
is
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
slightest
cause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
our
basic
argument.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
we
didn't
get
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
may
be
that
the
in
whole
part
of
this
may
have
been
slightly
misleading,
although
i
think
you
can
make
an
argument
that
you
can
end
up
with
in
whole
on
both
sides
as
a
conceptual
matter.
but
that's
not
the...
that
wasn't
the
complaint
at
trial.
it
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
trial
judge's
decision,
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
if
the
court
wants
to
send
it
back
and
say,
is
there
another
objection
to
this
instruction,
that's
fine.
but
it
seems
to
me,
this
court
ought
to
address
this
issue
in
the
way
it
has
been
presented.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
that's
proximate
causation.
and
that's
higher
than
we
were
required
to
prove
under
a
doctrine
of
equivalence,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address
just
sort
of
two
issues.
one
is
the
minimalist
issue
that
justice
breyer
asked
about.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
minimalist
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
we
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
missouri
standard
which
says
that
you
cannot
deviate
from
our
designated
instructions
creates
a
disparity
in
the
way
you
approach
negligence
and
contributory
negligence,
that
disparity
is
inconsistent
with
the
common
law
doctrines,
and
nothing
in
fela
modifies
it,
and
it's
wrong.
and
that
by
itself
warrants
the
case
being
set
aside
and
a
new
jury
being...
and
a
new
trial.
that's
the
simplest
way
to
resolve
the
issue.
if
the
court
wishes
to
go
forward
and
deal
with
the
issue
that
justice
souter
addressed,
then
the
question
is,
what
does
rogers
mean
and
what
do
you
do
with
this
"in
whole
or
in
part"
language.
and
if
you
go
back...
you
asked
the
question,
justice
souter,
you
know,
what
does
the
common
law
say.
we
cite
this
on
page
38.
if
its
negligence
contributes
proximately
to
the
injury,
no
matter
how
slightly...
there
must
be
a
dozen
cases
that
we
cite
in
those
briefs
that
talk
about
no
matter
how
slightly.
and
they
refer
to
"in
whole
or
in
part"
as
language
that
still
recognizes
that
you
still
require
proximate
causation.
the
reality
is
nothing
in
rogers
remotely
casts
doubt
on
cases
like
brady
that
say
but-for
causation
is
not
enough,
you
have
to
have
proximate
causation,
or
earnest,
where
this
court
said
that
proximate
causation
is
the
correct
jury
instruction
that
has
to
be
given.
this
court
said
nothing
about
that
in
rogers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg.
we
didn't
ask
for
that.
all
i'm
saying
to
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
that
the
guidance
of
the
court
on
remand,
you
could,
and
we
would
ask
you
to
address
that
issue
and
to
resolve
it.
it
is
fairly
in
front
of
you.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
that
would
be
my
preferred
instruction
on
remand,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that
would
certainly
go
a
long
way.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
strictly
you
want
to
do
it,
but
sure.
i
mean,
that's
the
pivotal
problem
with
the
way
that
instruction
reads
today,
justice
stevens.
