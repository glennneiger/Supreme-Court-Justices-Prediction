justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
argued
the
rogers
standard
was
a
correct
standard
in
the
missouri
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
the
blue
brief
in
response
to
respondent's
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would
add
to
that
that
we
don't
usually
look
at
a
bio
to
see
the
issues
that
the
petitioner
is
presenting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
two
things
you
might
comment
on.
first,
the
in
whole
or
in
part,
you
might
take
account
of
the
fact
that
there
are
other
negligent
actors,
third
parties,
who
have
contributed
to
the
injury
to
the
employee.
secondly,
section
53
does
not
contain
the
language
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
employee
associations,
workman
compensation
schemes
and
congress
have
all
relied
on
it.
