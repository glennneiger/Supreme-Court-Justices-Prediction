justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
the
question
whether
instruction
13
is
flawed
viewed
in
isolation,
or
whether
it
is
flawed
when
it's
viewed
together
with
the
instruction
on
employer
negligence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
agree
that
they
set
out
different
causation
standards,
12
and
13?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
causation
standards
are
in
fact
the
same,
then
instruction
13
is
defective;
isn't
that
right?
