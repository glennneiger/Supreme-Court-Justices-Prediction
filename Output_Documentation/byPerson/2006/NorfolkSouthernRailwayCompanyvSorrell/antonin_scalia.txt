justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the...
what
was
it,
the
rogers
case,
which
said
that
the...
well,
you
debate
whether
it
said
that,
but
let's
assume
that
it
said
that
the
rule
of
proximate
causality
doesn't
apply
to
the
negligence
of
the
defendant.
the
basis
for
that
holding
was
that
in
whole
or
in
part
language
which
is
used
for
the
negligence
of
the
defendant,
but
not
used
for
the
contributory
negligence.
so
if
you
believe
that
that
case
was
at
least
decided
for
the
right
reason,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
good
argument
that
it
changed
it
for
the
one,
but
not
for
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nobody
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
we've
rejected
petitions
for
certiorari
on
that
issue
at
least
a
couple
of
times.
eleven
circuits
are
in
agreement
as
to
what
rogers
required.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
really
expect
to
get
five
votes
for
the
railroad
on
this,
what
would
be
a
massive
change
of
what
is
assumed
to
be
the
law
for,
what,
50
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
were
wise
enough
not
to
ask
for
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
rogers
said,
in
whole
or
in
part.
now,
i
agree
with
you,
that
i
don't
see
how
that
does
it.
but
rogers
said
that
it
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
your
example
of
other
instances
including
having
to
compare
a
defendant
who
did
the
tort
intentionally
with
negligent...
contributory
negligence,
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
here
a
difference
in
the
causation.
intentional
or
non-intentional
has
nothing
to
do
with
causation.
but
once
you
say
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
causation,
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
compare
the
two.
you
cannot
compare
the
two
sensibly,
unless
you
are
using
the
same
kind
of
a
standard.
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
you
find
that
the
railroad
did
not
directly,
but
nonetheless
caused
the
injury
to
some
extent,
but
the
defendant
was
directly
contributory
to
it.
what
do
i
do?
do
i
add
another
40
percent
to
his
culpability
because
it
was...
his
causation
was
more
direct
than
the
plaintiff's
causation?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
it
certainly
bears
considerably
upon
the
culpability
of
the
two,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
answer
the
question,
justice
souter.
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
have
more
than
one
proximate
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
so
then
how
can
"in
whole
or
in
part"
possibly
eliminate
the
proximate
cause
requirement,
because
it
could
be
in
part
and
still
be
a
proximate
cause.
how
can
that
language
possibly
be
interpreted
to
eliminate
the
proximate
cause
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
say
no
when
you
acknowledge
that
the
prior
law
when
there
was
contributory
negligence
used
to
require
proximate
cause
for
both
the
negligence
of
the
defendant
and
for
the
contributory
negligence
of
the
defendant?
such
a
situation
could
not
exist
unless
proximate
cause
doesn't
have
to
be
the
sole
cause.
it
can
be
just
the
cause
in
part,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that
we
had
contributory
negligence
statutes
that
were
applying
proximate
cause
requirements
demonstrates
that
a
proximate
cause
can
be
a
cause
in
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
slight
is
the
opposite
of
proximate.
it
could
be
a
slight
proximate
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
the
kind
of
change
anybody
would
have
relied
on,
is
it?
i
mean,
i
find
it
hard
to
see
reliance
interest
on
this
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
hard
to
see
any
reliance
interest
on
this
50
year
old
interpretation.
is
there
anybody
doing
something
differently
because
they
believe
that
the
railroad
does
not
have
to
be
accused
of
proximate
causality?
does
anybody
act
differently
because
of
that
rule?
i
don't
think
so.
