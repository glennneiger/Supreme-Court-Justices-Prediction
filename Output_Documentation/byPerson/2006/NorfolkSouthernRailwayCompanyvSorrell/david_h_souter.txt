justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
would
be
satisfied...
not
wholly
satisfied,
but
substantially
satisfied
if
we
said,
yeah,
we
accept
the
doctrine
of
equivalence,
and
we
think
the
instruction
on
contributory
negligence
was
correct.
because
that
would
mean
in
the
next
case,
you
would
get
a
proximate
cause
instruction
on
defendant's
negligence.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
came
out
the
way
i
just
described--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
wouldn't
have
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
phillips,
may
i
interrupt
on
exactly
the
point
that
i
think
you're
addressing
with
justice
breyer?
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
one
view
of
rogers
is
that
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
eliminates
the
proximate
cause
instruction.
we
all
agree
that
that
is
one
view
of
rogers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
also
does
something
else.
and
i
don't
think
we
disagree
about
that
either.
it
specifically
instructs
the
jury
that
multiple
causation
may
be
present.
and
if
it
is,
if
the
defendant
is
at
least
one,
the
source
of
one
of
those
causes
under
rogers
even
slightly--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
that
will
suffice.
the
problem
i
have
with...
in
a
way
with
your
response
to
justice
breyer,
and
the
problem
that
i
have
with
the
instruction
that
your
side
requested
on
contributory
negligence
is
this:
it
seems
to
me
that
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
would
be
wrong
on
contributory
negligence,
or
at
least
it
would
be
very
misleading,
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
never
get
to
contributory
negligence
unless
you
found
the
defendant
was
negligent
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore,
if
the
plaintiff
is
also
negligent,
it
will
necessarily
be
in
part.
it
couldn't
be
wholly
or
in
part.
if
it
were
wholly
negligent,
you
would
never
have
found
the
defendant
was
negligent
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
to
the
extent
the
instruction
addresses
multiple
causation,
it
would
be
misleading
to
the
jury,
and
it
would
assume
a
possibility
that
couldn't
happen.
therefore,
if
you
are
not
going
to
mislead
the
jury
on
multiple
causation
when
you
instruct
on
contributory
negligence,
you've
got
to
have
some
other
way
of
addressing
the
proximate
cause
language.
is
that
analysis
right
or
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
the
instruction
that
your
side
asked
for,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
a
slight
cause
instruction,
it
was
an
in
whole
or
in
part
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
that...
all
right.
but
if
you're
asking
for
the
in
whole
or
in
part
instruction
on
contributory
negligence,
it
seems
to
me
the
judge
has
got
to
have
been
correct
in
saying
no
to
that,
because
to
the
extent
that
it
addresses
multiple
causation,
it
would
be
addressing
a
problem
that
couldn't
even
occur
in
contributory
negligence
which
will
always
be
in
part.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
he
rejected
it,
but
if...
we've
got
to
consider
it
in
deciding
whether
to
reverse
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
he
said.
he
said
equivalence
instruction
was
not
on
multiple
causation.
it
was
the
equivalence
instruction
on
either
proximate
cause
or
not
proximate
cause.
it
was
the
causation
issue,
it
was
the
proximate
causation
issue,
not
the
multiple
causation
issue
that
concerned
you,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
have
to
have
proximate,
we
don't
have
to
have
proximate.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
because
the
instruction
addresses
both,
in
one
view,
proximate
cause
and
multiple
cause,
it
would
have
been
misleading
so
far
as
the
multiple
cause
issue
was
concerned,
and
a
request
for
an
instruction
in
whole
or
in
part
on
contributory
negligence
really
should
have
been
denied.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
were
entitled...
your
argument
is
you
were
entitled
to
an
equivalent--
instruction
on
the
issue
of
the
need
to
prove--
justice
david
h.
souter
--proximate
cause
or
no
need
to
prove
proximate
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
basic
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
think
you
could
have
gotten
where
you
want
to
go
with
the
instruction
that
your
side
requested,
which
was
an
in
whole
or
in
part
instruction.
that's
my
only
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
direct
language?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
about
it
being
misleading
is
that
if
you
use
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language
for
a
contributory
negligence
instruction,
you
are
misleading
the
jury
into
thinking
that
at
least
there
might
be
whole
contributory
negligence.
there
never
will
be.
you
don't
get
the
contributory
negligence
unless
you've
already
found
the
defendant
was
negligent,
at
least
to
some
degree.
therefore,
if
the
plaintiff
is
negligent,
it
can
only
be
in
part.
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
no.
may
i
pick
you
up
on
that?
because
there's
a
point
at
which
you
and
i
are
disagreeing
about
rogers.
and
in
all
candor,
i
think
it's
because
you
are
ignoring
one
part
of
rogers,
and
if
i'm
wrong,
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
you
quote
the
slightest
bit
language
from
rogers
on
both
page
26
and
33
of
your
brief.
and
you
take
that
as
being
language
that
eliminates
the
proximate
cause
requirement.
what
you
don't
include
in
your
quotation
is
the
footnote
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
following
that
slightest
cause
language.
and
the
footnote
was
to
a
citation,
the
citation
was
to
the
coray
case.
the
opinion
in
coray
was
written
by
justice
douglas
and...
i'm
sorry,
justice
black.
and
in
the
very
language
that
justice
black
used,
he
said
expressly
that
if
proximate
cause
is
shown,
there
can
be
recovery.
now,
given
the
fact
that
in
rogers,
the
very
citation
to
the
language
which
you
say
eliminated
the
proximate
cause
requirement
cited
a
case
in
which
proximate
cause
was
part
of
the
very
sentence
relied
on,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
rogers...
maybe
later
cases,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
rogers
as
eliminating
the
proximate
cause
requirement.
and
therefore,
i
think
you
have
to
read
rogers
as
addressing
the
issue
of
multiple
causation,
not
proximate
causation.
now,
am
i
going
wrong
there
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
did,
but
he
was
also
pointing
out,
just
to
make
it
simpler,
he
was
pointing
out
in
crane
that
the
liability
arose
in
crane
out
of...
i
forget
the
full
name
of
it...
the
appliance
act.
and
the
appliance
act
had
its
own
set
of
standards.
and
therefore,
you
cannot,
from
an
appliance
act
case,
you
cannot
infer
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
general
standard
in
fela.
and
to
make
it
even
more
complicated,
as
i
recall,
rogers
was
an
appliance
case,
too,
but
he
didn't
get
into
that
there.
but
my
only
point
is,
you
are
right
about
the
two
brennan
opinions,
rogers
and
the...
crane.
but
given
the
fact
that
it
was
an
appliance
case,
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
one
thing
or
another
about
an
ultimate
fela
standard
in
the
absence
of
an
appliance
action.
what
remains
is
that
the
citation
in
rogers
was
to
coray,
and
coray
spoke
about
there
still
being
proximate
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
understood
by
everybody,
isn't
it,
that
at
least
it
has
the
conception
which
is
captured
by
using
the
word
13,
and
at
least
it
has
that
core
of
meaning
whenever
it
is
used,
doesn't
it?
in
other
words,
it
may
not
have
a
lot
of
bells
and
whistles
associated
with
it
in
the
prior
law,
but
at
least
it
requires
some
direct
causation
as
opposed
to
indirect,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
that's...
i
don't
know
that
justice
brennan's
citation
to
coray,
or
coray's
use
of
the
language
carries
you
any
further
than
that.
but
that's
as
far
as
mr.
phillips
wants
to
go.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
different
argument
from
saying
rogers
requires
it,
because
i
don't
think
you
can
get
that
out
of
rogers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
could
be
the
slightest
direct
cause,
which
is
justice
scalia's
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
it
may
mislead
the
jury
if
that's
all
you
say.
but
as
a
matter
of
analyzing
the
statute
or
even
of
analyzing
what
the
court
meant
in
rogers,
you
can
have
a
slight
but
direct
cause,
and
that
would
be
proximate
cause
in
the
traditional
analysis;
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
under
the
old
rule
that
plaintiff's
negligence
in
whatever
degree
was
an
absolute
bar
to
recovery,
wasn't
the
rule
customarily
stated
that
plaintiff's
negligence,
however
slight,
was
a
total
bar
to
recovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
it
was.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
yes,
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
harsh
rule.
