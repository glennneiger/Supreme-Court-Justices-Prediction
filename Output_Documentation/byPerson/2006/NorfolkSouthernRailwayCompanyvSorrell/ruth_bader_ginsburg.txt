mr.
phillips,
the
fundamental
problem,
at
least
for
me,
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
objection
at
all
at
trial
to
the
instruction
that
the
judge
gave
on
negligence.
there
was
an
instruction
requested
by
the
defendant
on
contributory
negligence,
which
read,
"such
negligence
of
plaintiff
contributed
in
whole
or
in
part
to
cause
his
injury.
"
that
was
the
only
instruction
objected
to,
because
the
refusal
to
give
that
instruction.
but
you
seem
to
be
using
that
as
a
lever
to
attack
the
instruction
on
negligence
to
which
no
objection
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
the
defendant
requested
a
charge
on
contributory
negligence
that
read,
"such
negligence
of
plaintiff
contributed
in
whole
or
in
part
to
cause
his
injuries.
"
you
didn't
want
the
direct
relationship,
you
didn't
ask
for
that.
you
asked
for
one
that
said,
"such
negligence
of
plaintiff
contributed
in
whole
or
in
part
to
his
injury.
"
now
you
are
saying
that
that
was...
what
you
asked
for
was
an
incorrect
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
my
memory
is
faulty,
but
as
i
recall
your
opening
brief,
many
pages
were
devoted
to
what
instruction
should
have
been
given
on
railroad
negligence.
you
were
dealing
not
simply
with
what
seems
to
be
the
question
presented,
that
is,
was
the
instruction
on
contributory
negligence
wrong,
because
it
said...
it
didn't
use
the
in
whole
or
in
part
language.
instead
it
said
directly
caused.
so
that's
the
limit
of
what
we
can
deal
with,
whether
the
in
whole
or
in
part
should
have
been
in
the
contributory
negligence.
but
it
was
your
brief
that
spent
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
proper
standard
for
the
railroad's
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
object
to
the
charge
that
was
given
on
negligence.
you
didn't
object
to
the
in
whole
or
in
part.
so
that
should
be
out
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
taking
them
up
on
any
argument
when
you
spent
half
your
brief
arguing
about
what
the
proper
standard
was
for
the
railroad's
negligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
wrong
with
the
instruction,
in
your
view
of
the
case,
that
was
given,
instruction
number
13,
negligence
of
plaintiff
directly
contributed
to
cause
his
injuries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
have
in
your
ideal
instruction
the
words
proximate
cause
given
to
the
jury,
that
defendant's
negligence
must
be
the
proximate
cause
of
plaintiff's
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
your
model
instruction,
in
your
correct
instruction,
would
the
jury
be
told,
in
order
to
hold
the
defendant
liable,
you
must
find
the
defendant's
negligence
is
the
proximate
cause
of
plaintiff's
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
almost
universally,
the
term
proximate
cause
has
been
criticized
as
totally
incomprehensible
to
juries?
