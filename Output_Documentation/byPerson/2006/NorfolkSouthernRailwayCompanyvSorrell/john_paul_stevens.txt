justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
assuming
you're
right
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
and
you're
wrong
on
proximate
cause,
for
the
moment.
now,
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument,
it
is
perfectly
clear
there
was
no
harmless
error
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
possible
interpretation
of
the
record...
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
of
the
record...
is
that
the
jury
either
believed
the
one...
one
truck
driver
or
the
other.
and
that
the
direct
causation
thing
really
didn't
have
an
impact
on
the
calculation
of
damages.
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
comment
on
that
and
to
tell
me
whether
during
the
argument
of
the
case
before
the
jury,
did
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
argue,
in
effect,
that
he
had...
the
railroad
has
a
much
heavier
burden
of
proving
a
causation
than
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may.
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
mr.
phillips.
is
there
such
an
animal
as
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
i
understand
the
restatement
describes
what
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
on
proving
causation,
and
then
it
says
the
same
rules
apply
to
defendant's
contributory
negligence.
but
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
any
overriding
doctrine
of
equivalence.
it
just
says
when
they
wrote
the
restatement,
the
rules
were
the
same.
is
there
such
a
thing
as
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
beyond
that,
if
the
plaintiff's
negligence
was
in
whole
the
cause
of
the
action,
then
the...
there
was
no
reason
to
get
to
comparative
negligence
or
contributory
negligence,
because
by
hypothesis,
there
would
have
been
no
negligence
by
the
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
employees
have
been
under
the
rule
for
a
long
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
one
very
brief
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
your
view,
would
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
be
satisfied
if
we
simply
directed
that
the
word
directly
be
omitted
from
the
instruction
13?
