ms.
mary
l.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
controlling
question
raised
here
is
whether
instruction
13
accurately
states
federal
law.
that's
exactly
what
petitioner
said
in
their
reply
brief
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
they
could
not
have
been
any
clearer
that
their
challenge
was
to
instruction
13.
in
john
versus
poulin,
this
court
said
that
state
courts
have
the
authority
to
prescribe
the
rules
of
procedure
in
their
courts
even
when
federal
issues
are
at
stake.
the
requirements
in
the
missouri
courts
were
not
complied
with
here.
no
abstract
question
was
presented.
the
sole
question
presented
and
preserved
was
with
respect
to
instruction
13.
and
that
can
again
be
seen
in
their
opening
brief
in
the
missouri
court
of
appeals,
which
specifically
says
the
trial
court
erred
in
giving
instruction
13
based
on
mai
32.07(b).
ms.
mary
l.
perry
it
is
viewed
in
conjunction
with
the
instruction
on
employer
negligence,
but
a
fixed
concept
of
what
it
was,
they
did
not
challenge
the
language
of
instruction
12.
they
accepted
that.
holding
that
language
constant,
what
should
we
do
to
instruction
13?
they
could
have
objected
to
instruction
12
and
13,
and
they
could
have
said,
here
are
a
pair
of
instructions
both
in
proximate
cause,
and
here
are
a
pair
of
instructions
both
in...
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part,
and
then
they
could
have
preserved
this
issue.
but
they
did
not
do
that.
they
accepted
instruction
12
as
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
and
said,
now
let's
look
at
instruction
13.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes,
they
do.
rogers
concluded
that
50
years
ago
and
the
courts
in
the
federal
and
state
system
have
nearly
uniformly
interpreted
rogers
as
reaching
that
decision.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes,
if
you
can
reach
that
decision
without
interpreting
instruction
12,
or
the
propriety
of
instruction
12,
particularly
since
instruction
12
contained
the
exact
language
of
the
statute.
whatever
judicial
gloss
has
been
put
on
that
language
was
not
told
to
the
jury.
justice
stevens,
the
question
you
asked,
whether
there
was
any
argument
about
the
different
standards,
the
answer
is
no.
there
was
no
argument.
the
only
way
in
which
the
jury
learned
of
this
difference
was
in
the
language
of
the
instruction.
and
instruction
12--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--there
wasn't
in
the
early
1900s
for
certain,
your
honor,
because
at
that
time,
even
petitioners
recognized
the
doctrine
was
emerging.
and
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
53,
it
talks
about
the
type
of
contributory
negligence
that
used
to
be
a
bar.
and
that
certainly
was
a
type
of
contributory
negligence
that
only
arose
with
the
traditional
proximate
cause.
it
certainly
wasn't
on
the
slightest
cause
standard.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
no,
your
honor.
you
can
conduct
the
comparison,
and
it
happens
all
the
time
in
cases
where
one
party
has
committed
intentional
misconduct
and
another
party
has
had
negligent
misconduct.
the
causation
standards
are
different
in
that
instance.
there's
a--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--well,
the
causation
standard
is
used
to
decide
what
negligence
you
use
in
the
balance
and
in
the
comparison.
for
example,
if
a
party
is
negligent,
but
the
negligence
had
no
causative
effect,
that
negligence
falls
out
of
the
analysis.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
no.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
it
just
affects
which
negligence
was
in
the
balance.
and--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--well,
in
responding...
going
back
to
your
question
about
intentional
conduct,
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
in
fact,
states
that
a
broader
range
of
harms
are
considered
proximately
caused
by
intentional
torts.
so
there
is
a
different
conception
of
proximate
cause
in
that
context.
but
in
any
event,
their
merits
brief
consistently
argues
for
a
proximate
cause
standard.
in
fact,
it
closes
with
that.
and
its
criticism
of
instruction
13
in
this
case
was
precisely
that
it
was
a
proximate
cause
standard.
so
if
they
are
now
before
this
court
asking
for
a
proximate
cause
standard,
they
conceded
that
instruction
13
was
a
proximate
cause
standard,
they
in
fact
complained
about
it
precisely
because
it
was
a
proximate
cause
standard,
that
issue
really
isn't
before
this
court
anymore.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
well,
i
think
justice
souter
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
on
that
one,
in
that
it
does
create
confusion
and
it
can
mislead
the
jury
that
the
railroad
worker
is
responsible
for
other
parties'
culpability
as
well.
moreover--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--well,
in--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--i
don't
want
to
interrupt
anybody.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
if
petitioner
had
asked
for
an
instruction
that
said
directly
contributed
in
part,
the
inclusion
of
the
phrase
in
part
there
might
not
have
any
impact.
it
could
still
potentially
mislead
the
jury,
but
they
were
seeking
not
just
to
add
the
words
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
but
remove
the
word
"directly"
because
it
connoted
proximate
cause,
and
that
they
felt
proximate
cause
was
not
the
appropriate
standard
for
contributory
negligence,
even
though
now
that
is
the
standard
that
they
solely
are
seeking.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
in
section--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
because
they
are
adopting
different
standards.
the
contributory
negligence--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--that's
one
reason.
but
another
reason
is
that
it's
a
different
standard.
in
section
53,
they're
talking
about
contributory
negligence
that
was
a
bar
to
liability.
that
type
of
contributory
negligence
was
the
kind
that
was
more
than...
it
wasn't
caused
by
slight
causation.
it
required
proximate
cause.
that
was
a
pretty
harsh
result.
and
it
certainly
didn't
arise
in
instances
where
the
plaintiff
had
just
had
the
slightest
causal
connection.
and
that
certainly
was
the
conclusion
in
rogers.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i
have
two
responses,
your
honor.
first,
justice
brennan
wrote
crane
twelve
years
later.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
and
he,
you
know,
definitely
clearly
said
that
a
railroad
worker
does
not
have
to
prove
common
law
proximate
causation
relying
on
rogers.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes.
but
if
we
look
at
those
earlier
cases,
particularly
coray,
we
can
see
that
rogers
articulated
what
was
meant
by
that
proximate
cause
language.
proximate
cause
is,
in
a
sense,
a
label
for
scope
of
liability
or
legal
cause,
as
the
restatement
says.
it
doesn't
have
any
singular
conception.
and
in
coray,
the
court
found--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
we
don't
accept
that,
but
even
if
that's
the
case,
the
rogers...
the
parties
to
rogers
immediately
interpreted
that
decision
as
affecting
proximate
cause.
twelve
years
later,
this
court
did
say
that
in
crane.
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly,
nearly
uniformly
interpreted
rogers
in
a
certain
way.
and
at
this
point,
stare
decisis
suggests
that
this
court
should
not
overrule.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
well,
and
i
also
think,
though,
that
by
lightening...
by
saying
the
slightest
cause
possible
or,
you
know,
a
slight
cause
would
create
liability,
that
does
affect
proximate
cause.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
because
section
53
refers
to
contributory
negligence
that
created
a
bar.
and
that
was
the
type
of
negligence
that
required
proximate
cause.
moreover,
the
type
of
instruction
you
are
positing
is
not
at
all
what
petitioner
requested
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
but
under
missouri
procedures,
you
have
to
be
clear
in
the
nature
of
your
objection,
and
the
objection
was
that
we
want
the
same
language,
we
want
the
language
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
and
out
of
respect
for
the
state
courts
and
their
right
to
create
the
rules
that
govern
in
those
courts,
that
was
not
satisfactory
under
missouri
rules.
missouri
rules
also
have
specific
requirements
for
what
you
have
to
do
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there's
a
84.04.
and
it
sets
forth
a
very
specific
format,
and
it's
supposed
to
start
with
"the
trial
court
erred
in",
and
then
you
give
your
reasons.
and
it
says
that
negligence...
it
erred
in
instructing
the
jury
to
find
plaintiff
negligent
only
if
it
concluded
that
his
negligence
directly
contributed
to
cause
his
injury,
rather
than
cause
his
injury
in
whole
or
in
part.
you
know,
there
is
no
issue
that
was
preserved
in
the
missouri
courts
other
than
that
challenge.
cook
versus
caldwell
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
in
missouri,
not
only
do
you
have
to
object,
but
you
have
to
keep
consistent
with
the
basis
of
the
objection.
you
can't
just
object
to
instruction
13
on
one
ground,
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
raise
a
completely
different
challenge
to
instruction
13.
you
have
to
stay
consistent.
and
out
of
respect--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--that
was
a
justification
for
rewriting
instruction
13
to
include
the
words
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
i
do
not
think
they
raised
an
abstract
argument
about
equivalency;
that
in
order
to
do
that,
they
would
have
had
to
object
to
instruction
12
and
instruction
13,
because
equivalency
in
the
abstract
would
require
modification
of
both
instructions,
and
they
clearly
chose
to
accept
the
language
of
instruction
12
and
only
object
to
instruction
13.
so
no,
not
in
the
abstract,
it
hasn't
been
raised.
it
was
a
justification
for
one
particular
result,
and
that
was
a
result
that
would
have
modified
instruction--
13.
and
in
a
particular
way,
too,
modified
it
in
a
way
of
including
the
words
ms.
mary
l.
perry
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
could
you--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--we
disagree
with
petitioner.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
the
abstract
question
of
equivalency--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--right.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
well,
i
think
we're
in
a
difficult
position
right
now,
because
they're
asking
for
proximate
cause
in
their
blue
brief--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--okay.
if
we're
putting
aside
the
blue
brief
then--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--but
if
the
question
goes
to
the
fact
that
section
53
doesn't
have
an
express
causation
standard
in
it,
what
you
fall
back
on
is
traditional
proximate
cause,
that
congress
departed
from
the
traditional
proximate
cause
standard
by
using
the
words
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
in
section
51.
it
didn't
create
the
same
departure
in
section
53.
in
fact,
by
referring
to
the
kind
of
contributory
negligence
that
creates
a
bar,
it
was
pretty
much
pointing
right
back
to
proximate
cause.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i
believe
the
treatises
that
say
yes.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
because
when
a
cause
that...
when
a
slightest
cause
can
give
rise
to
liability,
that
has
effectively
reduced
or
relaxed
that
causation
standard.
there
is
still
a
legal
cause
requirement,
yes.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
well,
but
if
we
look
at
like
the
first--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--well,
no.
the
restatement,
for
example,
at
the
time
of
rogers
talked
about
substantial
factors,
and
talked,
in
other
words--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--right.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes,
your
honor,
but
what
rogers
and
the
statute
recognizes
that
it
can
be
a
very,
very
slight
cause.
and
what
it
was
understood,
for
example,
in
the--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--and
neither
did
the
instruction.
it
just
used
the
words
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
also.
but
rogers
did
interpret
the
language
as
meaning
playing
any
part,
even
the
slightest.
and
that
has
been
the
law
for
50
years.
and
it
would
be
a
massive
change
in
the
law,
as
justice
scalia
said
earlier,
for
this
court
to
depart
from
that
at
this
point
in
time.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
the
restatement
at
the
time
of
rogers
talked
about
substantial
factors,
and
in
the
comment
to
that,
it
explains
that
sometimes
the
other
causes
can
be
so
predominant
that
one
causation
is
just
not
sufficiently
significant
or
of
sufficient
quantum
to
constitute
a
legal
cause.
so
there
is
a
component
of
quantity
within
the
concepts
of
proximate
cause.
i
believe
their
reply
brief
talks
about
substantial
factor,
and
to
talk
about
something
as
being
a
substantial
factor
does
have
a
quantum
component
to
it,
just
as
slight
has
a
quantum
component
to
it.
a
slight
cause
could
not
be
a
substantial
factor,
or
oftentimes
would
not
be
a
substantial
factor.
so
the
two
really
do
go
hand
in
glove.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
it
may
be.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
so
that
would
be
a
pretty
harsh
remedy
if
that
were
the
case.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
and
clearly,
congress
in
this
statute
was
trying
to
move
away
from
the
common
law
in
many
respects
to
protect
the
railroad
worker.
and
the
interpretation
of
section
51
as
lightening
the
causation
standard
for
the
defendant's
negligence,
but
leaving
intact
the
traditional
proximate
cause
standard
for
plaintiff's
contributory
negligence
completely
comports
with
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
i
reach
that
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
rogers.
and
in
the
petitioner's
brief--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
even
the
petitioner's
brief
describes
the
language
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
as
an
elaboration
of
proximate
cause.
they
recognize
that
it
has
bearing
on
proximate
cause.
and
so
if
it
has
bearing
on
proximate
cause
in
section
51,
it
certainly
would
have
bearing
on
proximate
cause
if
it
was
incorporated
into
the
language
of
the
instruction
on
contributory
negligence.
so
that
may
be
one
reason
for
not
including
the
language,
but
another
reason
is
that
it
does
affect
the
causation
standard
and
congress
did
not
incorporate
it
in
section
53,
whereas
it
did
have
it
in
section
51.
and
when
it
modified
the
statute
in
1939
for
assumption
of
the
risk,
to
abolish
assumption
of
the
risk,
it
did
not
equate
proximate
cause
and
necessarily
as
the
same
thing
because
one
version
had
proximate
cause
and
it
was
not
adopted.
the
phrase
was
used
in
its
place.
so
suggesting
that
congress
may,
in
fact,
have
seen
a
difference,
just
as
rogers
concluded,
and
i
think
rightly
so.
moreover,
as
i
said,
that
has
been
the
law
for
50
years,
and
it's
pretty
settled
in
this
country
and
it
would
create
a
massive
change
if
this
court
were
to
depart
from
that.
moreover,
this
is
not
the
right
case
to
decide
that
because
the
language
in
instruction
12
said,
and
petitioner
has
never--
ms.
mary
l.
perry
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
mary
l.
perry
well,
for
mr.
sorrell
in
particular,
i
mean,
he
acted,
that
he
allowed
that
instruction
to
be
used,
and
now
they're
attempting
to
disrupt
this
judgment.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
yes,
you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
and
there
is
employees'
compensation
for
railroad
workers,
and
that
may
be
very
well
be
because
of
this
interpretation
of
rogers
that
was
adopted
50
years
ago.
ms.
mary
l.
perry
thank
you.
