justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
an
arizona
jury
found
respondent
jeffery
landrigan
guilty
of
felony
murder
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
following
an
unsuccessful
direct
appeal
and
state
post-conviction
proceedings,
landrigan
filed
this
federal
habeas
application
alleging
that
his
counsel
was
ineffective
for
failing
to
explore
additional
grounds
for
mitigation
of
death
sentence.
the
district
court
concluded
that
landrigan
could
not
make
out
even
a
colorable
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
it
therefore
refuse
to
grant
landrigan
and
evidentiary
hearing
and
denied
his
application.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
landrigan
an
evidentiary
hearing.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
a
federal
district
court
does
not
abuse
its
discretion
by
refusing
to
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing
when
the
record
from
the
state
court
proceedings
clearly
demonstrates
that
an
applicant
cannot
prove
facts
that
would
allow
the
district
court
to
grant
habeas
relief.
in
this
case,
landrigan’s
actions
during
sentencing
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
he
would
have
undermined
the
presentation
of
any
mitigating
evidence
that
his
attorney
might
have
uncovered.
at
sentencing
landrigan
refused
to
allow
witnesses
to
testify
on
his
behalf
when
the
trial
judge
enquired
about
landrigan’s
refusal,
landrigan
stated
that
he
did
not
want
any
mitigating
evidence
presented
when
his
attorney
attempt
to
tell
the
judge
what
mitigating
evidence
have
you
planned
to
present,
landrigan
interrupted
several
times
in
a
disruptive
manner.
finally,
landrigan
told
the
judge,
“if
you
want
to
give
me
the
death
penalty
just
bring
it
on,
i
am
ready
for
it.”
because
he
would
have
prevented
the
introduction
of
any
mitigating
evidence,
landrigan
cannot
now
show
that
his
counsel’s
failure
to
uncover
further
mitigating
evidence
caused
him
any
prejudice.
on
this
record
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
this
discretion
by
refusing
to
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing.
in
addition,
to
state
courts’
determination
that
landrigan’s
substantive
claims
were
frivolous
and
meritless,
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court’s
precedent
in
wiggins
versus
smith.
neither
wiggins
nor
any
other
case
from
this
court
has
addressed
the
situation
in
which
a
defendant
actively
interferes
with
counsel’s
efforts
to
present
mitigating
evidence
to
a
sentencing
court.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
landrigan’s
decision
not
to
present
mitigating
evidence
was
not
informed
and
knowing.
but
as
landrigan’s
counsel
conceded,
we
have
never
imposed
an
informed
and
knowing
requirement
up
on
the
defendant’s
decision
not
to
introduce
mitigating
evidence.
even
if
such
an
requirement
existed
landrigan
has
not
pointed
to
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
his
decision
was
not
informed
and
knowing.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
