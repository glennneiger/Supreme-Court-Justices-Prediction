mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
clearing
up
what
exactly
we
did
and
didn't
argue
with
respect
to
waiver
and
what
exactly
is
and
isn't
before
this
court
on
that
set
of
issues
in
our
judgment.
i
then
would
like
to
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
on
what
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
did
and
what
effect
that
would
have
on
this
court's
disposition
of
the
case.
and
if
there's
any
time
remaining.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
we
have
asserted
colorable
claims
that
warrant
an
evidentiary
hearing
here,
which
is
all
that
we're
asking
for.
now,
with
respect
to
this
question
of
whether
we
pursued
or
didn't
pursue
waiver,
i'm
afraid
counsel
for
the
state
is
just
wrong
about
this.
it's
important
to
understand
how
this
comes
up.
we
asserted
a
claim
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
deficient
performance
and
prejudice.
the
state
asserted
as
a
defense
to
that
claim:
no,
no,
he's
waived.
and
the
trial
judge,
the
state
habeas
judge
in
the
state
court
conviction
ruling,
agreed
with
that
and
said,
well,
yes,
he's
waived.
we
then
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
which
we
said,
no,
you
can't
rely
on
that
defense
because
it's
got
to
be
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
under
johnson
against
zerbst.
that's
at
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
motion
for
rehearing
was
denied
without
any
further
comment.
we
then
took
a
petition
to
review
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
that's
also
in
the
joint
appendix
and
i
believe
the
page
cite
is
101
and
102,
in
which
we
specifically
argued
that
you
can't
look
to
this
so-called
waiver
as
a
defense
to
our
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
because
it
wasn't
knowingly
and
intent.
now,
in
the
state's
response
to
our
petition,
which
unfortunately
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix
but
is
in
the
record,
the
state
says:
no,
this
waiver
is
binding
and,
furthermore,
you're
procedurally
defaulted
because
this
procedure
was
decided
on
direct
review.
but
the
one
thing
the
state
does
not
say
is
that
you
raised
this
johnson
against
zerbst
issue
too
late,
it
can't
be
considered.
we
then
went
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
may
have
the
wrong
page.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
will
find
it
for
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
for
the
delay
here.
the
motion
for
rehearing
is,
i'm
sorry,
99,
and
on
102
is
where
we
raise
it,
and
then
subsequently...
then
subsequently
we
raise
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
it
doesn't
have
to,
but,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
there's
no...
but
the
point
is
that's
not...
when
we
took
this
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
that's
not
an
argument
that
the
state
made
in
opposition
to
our
raising
johnson
against
zerbst.
then
when
we
got
to
the
federal
district
court
we
raised
this
again,
this
exact
argument
in
federal
district
court,
and
the
state
in
federal
district
court
didn't
object
that
we
had
failed
to
raise
this
appropriately
in
the
state
proceedings.
we
took
it
to
the
ninth
circuit.
they
didn't
raise
the
objection
that
we
failed
to
raise
it
appropriately
in
the
state
proceedings.
the
first
time
that
question
has
even
been
raised
here
is
in
the
reply
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
and
i
think
that's
tied
to
the
next
point
i
want
to
make,
which
is
significant,
which
is
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
the
ninth
circuit
has
ruled
that
we
have
met
the
requirements
of
2254(e)(2)
and
are
therefore
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
what
the
state
is
essentially
saying
is,
well,
no,
you
really
aren't
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
this
set
of
issues
because
you
didn't
raise
them
adequately
in
the
state
court.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
on
both,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
let
me
move
to
that
if
i
could,
because
i
do
think
that's
significant.
i
think
the
court
has
elucidated
the
two
potential
readings
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
it
seemed
to
us
as
we
prepared
this
case
on
the
merits
that
the
reality
is
that
the
two,
the
issue
of
performance
and
the
issue
of
waiver,
are
tied
together,
because
if
it
comes
out
after
a
hearing
that
counsel
did
perform
an
effective
job,
a
diligent
job
of
performing
the
investigation,
and
did
instruct
the
client
as
to
what
the
mitigation
evidence
was,
then
you
view
the
waiver
in
a
different
light
than
of
course
you
would
if
the
counsel
hadn't.
so
we
acknowledge
here
that
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
ought
to
be
a
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we're
trying
to
establish
there,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
want
to
respond
directly
to
your
honor's
question,
if
you'll
just
permit
me
one
more
thought
about
the
ninth
circuit
and
i'll
turn
right
back
to
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so
in
other
words,
we
are
making
a
more
modest
request
for
relief
here
which,
is
affirmance
of
the
judgment
sending
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
but
with
a
recognition
that
the
evidentiary
hearing
ought
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
waiver,
which
should
be
understood
to
be
left
open.
i
think
we're
conceding
something
here,
that
waiver
ought
to
be
left
open
and
not
definitively
resolved.
it's
premature
to
definitively
resolve
that
against
the
state
without
an
inquiry.
now,
turning
to
your
honor's
point,
the...
with
respect
to
whether
there
was
a
waiver
here
or
not
and
what
the
state
judge
did
or
didn't
do,
something
very
significant
here
that
i
think
the
state's
argument
just
overlooks.
there's
an
assumption
in
the
state's
argument
that
landrigan's
conduct
at
the
sentencing
hearing
itself
was
a
waiver
and
considered
to
be
a
waiver.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
transcript
of
that
hearing,
and
this
is
d
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition
and
beginning
at
page
d-4...
d-3
is
where
the
colloquy
occurs
where
this
alleged
waiver
happened.
the
very
next
thing
that
occurs,
the
very
next
thing
that
occurs,
is
the
trial
judge
says:
okay,
i
want
to
hear
from
the
mitigation
witnesses.
then
the
mitigation
witnesses
say:
well,
we're
not
going
to
testify.
then
the
very
next
thing
that
occurs
is
the
trial
judge
says:
well,
i
want
a
proffer
of
what
they
would
have
said.
then
when...
then
when
all
that's
said
and
done,
the
trial
judge
says
to
the
lawyer...
and
this
is
at
d-15...
you
got
anything
else,
and
the
lawyer
says,
no,
your
honor,
that's
all
i've
got,
all
i've
got
is
what's
in
the
sentencing
memo
and
these
two
witnesses.
then
the
judge
proceeds
to
pass
sentence.
that's
the...
the
particularly
important
pages
are
d-20
and
21,
and
on
those
pages
you
will
see
that
what
the
judge
does
is
not
treat
mr.
landrigan's
statements
as
a
waiver,
because
if
she
had
treated
those
statements
as
a
waiver
what
she
would
have
said
is,
well,
here's
the
aggravation
case,
mr.
landrigan
has
waived
mitigation,
he
has
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
respectfully--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--let
me
address
your
second
question
first
and
then
your
first
question.
i
think
that
that
in
two
senses
does
not
accurately
represent
what
this
mitigation
case
presented
to
the
state
court
and
presented
to
the
federal
court
is
all
about.
with
respect
even
to
his
affidavit,
which
i
don't
think
fairly
under
arizona
procedure
can
define
the
full
scope
of
his
claim,
but
with
respect
to
that
affidavit
alone,
what
it
says
is
not
genetic
predisposition.
it
says
the
"biological
component
of
violence".
that's
the
language
that
mr.
landrigan's
affidavit
uses.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
one
other
thing
it
does
that's
very
significant,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
it
also
says
that
these
witnesses
can
attest
to
the
use
of
alcohol
and
drugs
by
the
biological
mother
when
landrigan
was
in
utero.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
what
he's
saying
that
he
would
have
agreed
to,
it
seems
to
me
the
only
fair
reading
in
this
affidavit,
which
again
i
don't
think
fairly
defines
the
full
scope
of
what
he's
allowed
to
proceed
with
under
arizona
procedure,
but
with
respect
to
this
affidavit
he's
saying,
well,
if
you
had
had
an
expert
who
could
have
come
in
and
given
testimony
about
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
and
the
organic
brain
damage
and
other
impairments
that
it
causes,
i
would
have
cooperated
with
that.
and
that's
really
significant
because
if
you
look
at
page
d-21
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--because
all
the
biological
mother
would
have
had
to
do
was
to
give
that
information
to
the
expert.
that's
a
routine
matter,
for
experts
to
gather
factual
information
and
assimilate
it
into
an
expert
opinion
and
then
provide
it
to
the
court.
that
could
have
happened
easily
here.
and
i
think
it's
very
significant
because
on
page
21
you'll
see
that
the
trial
judge
makes
a
fundamental
error
about
this
exact
issue.
she
says:
well,
i'll
grant
this,
i'll
take
the
mother's
testimony
as
a
proffer.
i'll
consider
the
possibility
of
fetal
alcohol
syndrome,
but
all
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
establishes
is
that
the
kid
will
also
have
a
predisposition
to
addiction.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
sure,
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unreasonable
about
that.
those
are
very
different
experiences,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
i...
whatever
else
happened,
the
trial
judge
here
considered
this
evidence
of
mitigation
and
did
a
weighing.
and
the
key
point
i
want
to
make
sure
i
make
here
is
that
therefore
any
evidence
that
this
lawyer
had
prepared,
an
expert
on
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
most
prominently
and
any
other
evidence,
the
trial
lawyer
could
have
proffered
at
the
time
and
had
considered
at
the
time
and
had
weighed
at
the
time
by
this
trial
judge.
and
that's
a
claim
of
prejudice,
it
seems
to
me,
that
even
if
one
grants,
even
if
one
assumes...
and
we
dispute
it
and
i'd
like
too
talk
about
that...
but
even
if
one
assumes
that
there
is
a
finding
and
we
can't
do
anything
about
it
that
landrigan
would
not
have
cooperated
in
the
presentation
of
any--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there's
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that
question.
it's
something--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
it's
possible.
it's
certainly
possible.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
think
i
don't...
i
want
to
make
sure
i
don't
leave
any
implication
that
the
rule
we're
asking
for
here
is
going
to
open
the
door
to
lots
of
claims,
because
i
don't
think
it
does
for
two
sets
of
reasons.
one
is
a
procedural
set
of
reasons
and
that's
the...
that,
we
refer
the
court
to
the
blackledge
against
allison
decision...
that
if...
that
it's
not
going
to
be
enough
in
every
case
for
you
to
plead
an
adequate
claim
and
then
jump
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
as
the
court
said
in
allison,
the
district
court
has
available
to
it
a
number
of
tools
that
it
can
use
to
test
the
claim
before
granting
an
evidentiary
hearing.
so
there's
a
limitation
there.
now--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that's
important,
and
hopefully
it
will
help
explain
why
we
think
that
this
is
a
narrow...
that
the
rule
we're
asking
for
here
is
a
narrow
one,
and
it's
not
going
to
open
the
door
to
lots
of
claims.
it's
clear
that
just
like
the
waiver
of
any
other
fundamental
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
defendant's
got
to
understand
what
mitigation
means.
he's
got
to
understand
its
significance
in
the
proceedings--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
he
needs
to
be
assisted
by
competent
counsel.
that's
a
consistent
theme
of
this
court's
decisions
on
the
johnson
inquiry.
and
so
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
you
have
documented
that
the
client
understands
what
mitigation
is...
and
frankly
i
don't
think,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
the
kind
of
documentation
that
ought
to
suffice.
but
even
if
you
had
that,
even
if
you
documented
that
the
defendant
understood
it,
even
if
you
documented
that
the
defendant
clearly
waived
it
and
documented
that
was
done
with
counsel's
assistance,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
is
going
to
be
very
hard
for
a
habeas
petitioner
to
plead
something
that's
going
to
get
past--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
because
i
think
there
isn't
clarity
at
all
that
he
understands
what
mitigating
evidence
is,
what
the
full
scope
of
it
is
and
how
it
could--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
time
the
trial
judge
didn't
treat
that
as
a
waiver.
and
so
i
don't
think
you
can
cut
off
his
ability
to
litigate
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
years
later
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
ineffective
waiver.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think,
justice
alito,
we're
making
a
couple
of
different
claims,
not
that
claim,
but
a
couple
of
different
claims.
one
is,
and
it
pertains
particularly
to
a
mental
health
expert,
that
even
if
landrigan
behaved
exactly
the
way...
at
13...
he
in
fact
behaved
in
the
counterfactual
world
in
which
he
had
received
adequate
representation,
that
the
mental
health
expert
testimony
could
have
been
proffered
to
the
court,
had
it
been
prepared
and
developed,
would
have
been
considered,
and
could
have
made
a
critically
important
difference
and
for
precisely
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg's
question
suggested,
which
is
that
he's
obviously
behaving
badly
in
this
situation.
what
the
trial
court
ruled
out
of
that
is,
well,
he's
an
amoral
person.
what
the
mental
health
testimony
would
give
you
is
an
alternative
frame
of
reference
for
making
a
reasoned
moral
judgment
about
this
guy,
and
could
be
critically
important
in
explaining
that
behavior.
so
even
within
the
confines
of
accepting
that
the
world
would
have
unfolded
exactly
the
way
it
did,
it
was
ineffective
to
have
dropped
the
ball
on
preparing
that
kind
of
evidence.
then
it's
also
ineffective
in--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
to
the
basic
weighing
the
mitigation
which
the
judge
undertook
based
on
all
proffered
evidence.
then
beyond
that,
we're
making
an
argument
that
the
waiver
that,
even
if
you
are
going
to
consider
that
a
waiver,
you
can't
consider
it
a
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver,
knowing
intelligent
waiver
supported
adequately
by
the
efforts
of
counsel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue.
with
all
due
respect,
justice
alito,
i
think
the
test
under
strickland
is
whether
there
was
sufficient
performance,
which
we
think
we
have
a
very
powerful
record
of
here,
and
then
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different.
and
i
think
the
inquiry
here
that
the
state
habeas
judge
is
undertaking
is
the
reasonable
probability
inquiry.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
mixed
question
that
requires--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
taking
our
first
argument
to
the
side,
our
first
argument
which
i've
been
discussing
about
what
happened
at
the
hearing,
i
think
with
respect
to
that
argument
the
answer's
no,
that
argument
stands
without
any
need
to
disprove
the
factual
finding,
if
you
assume
it
is
a
factual
finding,
and
we
don't
concede
that.
but
if
it
is
a
factual
finding,
then
yes,
we
would
have
to
disprove
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
we
think
we
can
do
that,
and
all
we're
asking
for
is
a
hearing
to
enable
us
the
opportunity.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor,
for
bringing
us
back
to
that
question.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
with
one
addition,
which
is
this
one,
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
expert
testimony
is
very
important.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
would
you
permit
me
to
answer
that
question,
and
i'll
come
back
to
your
honor's?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
the...
with
respect
to
the
standard,
there
are
two
things
that
we
have
to
show
and
if
we
do,
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing.
one
is
that
we're
not
disentitled
under
the
analysis
under
section
2254(e)(2)
as
explicated
in
the
court's
michael
williams
decision,
to
show
that
the
court
below
found
it,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
cert
petition.
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
opposition
that
it
wasn't
raised,
it
had
nothing
about
it.
that's
established
and
the
case
comes
to
the
court.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
(e)(2)
does
not
apply
to
us
proceeding
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
because
the...
there
is
no
lack
of
diligence
here
that
would
trigger
us
meeting
the
heightened
requirements
of
(e)(2),
and
therefore
it
doesn't
apply
to
bar
us.
that's
the
theory.
now,
with...
the
other
thing
we
have
to
show--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor.
that's...
as
we
understand
the
michael
williams
decision
interpreting
that
provision,
your
honor,
those
requirements
only
kick
in
in
a
situation
where
you
haven't
shown
diligence
and
therefore
you're
at
fault,
and
you
can
overcome
your
fault
by
meeting
those
heightened
standards.
they
don't
apply
in
a
situation
where
you
have
been
diligent
and
therefore
you're
not...
they
don't
apply
to
you
at
all.
with
respect
to
the...
what
else...
with
respect
to
what
else
we'd
have
to
show,
we'd
have
to
show
that...
and
this
is
the
townsend
standard,
which
nothing
has
changed...
that
we've
alleged
facts
which,
if
proven,
entitle
us
to
relief.
those
are
the
two
things
we
have
to
show
and
we've
done
both
of
those
things.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
the
ninth
circuit...
and
it
seems
to
us
actually,
your
honor,
under
townsend
in
that
situation
the
hearing's
mandatory.
the
district
court
would
have
discretion
under
habeas,
under
habeas
practice,
to
hold
a
hearing
as
a
discretionary
matter
even
in
a
situation
where
we
haven't
shown
a
mandatory
entitlement
to
it.
so
there
is
discretion
there.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
but
i
think...
what
i
think
is
important
there
is
that
that
issue
ought
to
be
decided
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
when
you
know
what
it's
going
to
be.
it's
premature
to
decide
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
they
could,
but
it
seems
to
me
not
until
you
actually
hear
the
expert
testimony,
and
then
we
have
all
of
the
other
testimony
that
justice
breyer
detailed
that
you'd
want
to
consider.
i
do
want
to
try
to
come
back,
justice
scalia,
to
your
point.
yes,
we
acknowledge
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far
in
the
way
your
honor
described.
but
you
don't
get
from
that
conclusion
to
the
conclusion
that
you
ought
to
grant
the
relief
that
the
state
is
requesting
here,
which
is
a
reversal
and
directing
dismissal
of
the
petition,
because
to
get
to
that
you
have
to
show
that
there's
no
set
of
circumstances
under
which
we
could
prevail.
we're...
our
position
is
an
intermediate
one,
which
is
that
the
right
answer
here
is
that
the
judgment
to
send
it
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
that
is
an
inappropriately
truncated
assessment
of
the
mitigation
case
and
a
wrongly
focused
assessment
of
the
mitigation
case,
which
ought
to
focus
on
the
troubled
history
and
the
fetal
alcohol
syndrome,
which
provide
a
medical
mental
health
explanation
for
his
conduct
which
is
quite
different
and
that...
and
so
that's
what
ought
to
be
balanced.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
fact
that
she
used
abusive...
that
she
abused
alcohol,
but
not
the
medical
expert
testimony
explaining
what
effects
that
would
have.
that's
precisely
the
thing
that
wasn't
there
and
that
was
the
big
problem.
so
i
do
think
that
that...
that's
why
we
need
an
evidentiary
hearing,
to
develop
that.
this
weighing,
by
the
way--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
you
look
at
page
d-21,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
you'll
see
is
actually
proof
in
the
transcript
that
she
had
no
familiarity,
because
she
said
on
page
d-21
all
it
does
is
predispose
you
to
being
an
addict
yourself.
but
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
is
a
much,
much
broader
set
of
impairments
that
can
bear
directly
on
one's,
one's
moral
culpability.
if
i
could
just
say--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--sure.
what
there
was
that
the
ninth
circuit,
upon
receiving
this
letter,
contacted
counsel
for
mr.
landrigan,
asked
him...
asked
them
to
go
visit
him
in
prison
and
find
out
what's
going
on.
they
did
so.
they
reported
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
mr.
landrigan
did
in
fact
want
to
proceed
with
the
appeals.
he
has
continued
to
want
to
proceed
with
the
appeals,
signing
the
ifp
papers,
et
cetera,
and
it
turns
out
there
were
neurological
problems
that
were
afflicting
him,
very
serious,
at
the
time.
so
that's
what
happened.
if
i
could
say
in
conclusion,
just
remind
the
court
what
it
said
in
the
first
norrell
decision,
that
even
in
the
world
of
habeas
there's
a
difference
between
deference
and
abdication.
and
in
a
situation
like
this
one,
in
which
the
state
court
has
not
afforded
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
has
not
allowed
the
development
of
the
evidence
that
bears
directly
on
mr.
landrigan's
claims,
it
would
be
a
form
of
abdication
to
hold
that
he
can
be
conclusively
barred
from
proceeding
further,
even
to
an
evidentiary
hearing,
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record.
thank
you.
