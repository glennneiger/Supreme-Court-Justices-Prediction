well,
how
could
the
district
court
on
remand
find
that
there
was
a
valid
waiver
when
the
ninth
circuit
says
on
a-17,
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
for
all
the
foregoing
reasons,
landrigan
has
not
waived
the
right
to
assert
a
claim
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
are
you
claiming
that...
are
you
claiming
that
his
attorney
did
not
adequately
represent
him
at
the
sentencing
hearing
with
respect
to
the
question
of
waiver?
in
other
words,
when...
that
the
attorney
should
have
insisted
that
the
judge
go
through
some
kind
of
more
comprehensive
colloquy
with
him
about
waiver
and
inform
him
of
certain
things
about
what
he
was
giving
up?
are
you
making
that
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
a
separate
question,
whether
it's
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver?
isn't
the
question
here
whether
he
was
prejudiced,
which
is
a
question
of
fact,
which
is
a
question
of
whether
had
he
been
informed
of
the
possibility
of
mitigation
evidence
relating
to
a
history
of
family
violence,
he
would
have
persisted
in
blocking
the
admission
of
any
mitigation
evidence?
isn't
that
the
issue?
not
whether
it
was
knowing
and
intelligent.
that
would
be
a
separate
legal
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
it's
a
mixed
question.
but
if
the
post-conviction
relief
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
even
had
he
known
about
the
possibility
of
this
type
of
mitigation
evidence,
he
would
have
persisted
in
refusing
to
cooperate...
if
there
was
such
a
finding,
and
know
you
dispute
it...
and
if
you
were
granted
a
hearing,
is
it
not
true
you
would
have
to
disprove
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
