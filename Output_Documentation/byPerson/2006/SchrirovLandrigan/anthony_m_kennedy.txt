justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
got
to
the
third
point
you
were
going
to
make.
you
were
outlining
three
different
points.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
from
the
very
start,
what
happens
is
that
you
and
your
brother
for
the
respondent
are
talking
past
each
other.
you
want
to
talk
to
us
about
the
adequacy
of
the
state
court's
finding.
the
respondent
says
what
we...
all
we
want
is
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
and
those
are
two
different
issues.
we
want
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
i.e.,
so
that
we
can
show
the
findings
are
insubstantial
or
incorrect.
those,
it
seems
to
me,
are
two
different
issues,
and
i
sense
the
briefs
are
talking
past
each
other
on
this
point.
did
you
see
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
what
is
the
standard
for
when
the
district
court
may
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing?
i
know
there's
an
element
of
discretion
in
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
only
time
the
district
court
can
hold
a
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it
seems
that
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
then
that's
a
bar.
but
if
he
has
done
that,
when
can
he
ask
for
a
further
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
the
waiver
point,
let's
assume
that
this
case
had
not
come
in...
come
here,
and
you
had
gone
back
to
the
district
court
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
ninth
circuit.
surely
you
would
have
taken
the
position,
or
you
could
have
taken
the
position
if
the
evidence
developed
that
way,
that
he
really
knew
or
should
have
known
about
all
this
mitigating
evidence
and
he
waived.
you
certainly
could
continue
to
take
that
position
in
the
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
district
court
would
say
i
now
have
a
more
full,
factual
record,
and
i
make
the
finding
that
there
was
knowing
waiver,
or
there
wasn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
doesn't
that
assume
that
the
defendant
know
what
mitigating
evidence
is?
i
mean,
this
defendant,
i
suppose
wants
to
show,
"i
thought
mitigating
evidence
was
just
going
to
be
what
the,
these
two
relatives
were
going
to
testify
to.
"
"there
was
really
much
more,
if
my
counsel
had
investigated.
"
and
that's
not
a
knowing
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
district
court
has
substantial
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
grant
that
hearing
on
that
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
part
of
that
discretion
is,
and
you've
been
careful
to
say
this,
that
there's
a
likelihood
of
a
different
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
difficult
part
of
your
case
based
on
this
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
know
what
the
fetal
alcohol
testimony
is
going
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
could
make
a
determination
or
the
court
of
appeals
could
make
a
determination
or
the
district
court
could
make
a
determination
how
likely
that
would
to
be
affect
the
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
just
one
other
question
on
a
different
matter.
in
judge
bias's
dissent,
judge
bay's
dissent,
he
quotes
a
letter
from
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
does
not
want
to
proceed
with
this
appeal
and
wants
the
execution
scheduled.
can
you
comment
on
that?
