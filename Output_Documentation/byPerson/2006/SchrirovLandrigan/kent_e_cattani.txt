mr.
kent
e.
cattani
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit's
rejection
of
a
reasoned
state
court
factual
determination
and
decision
is
improper
under
any
deferential
standard
of
review,
and
it
is
particularly
improper
under
the
highly
deferential
standard
of
review
required
under
the
aedpa.
this
morning
i'd
like
to
try
to
develop
three...
three
points.
first,
the
state
court's
factual
finding
that
landrigan
instructed
his
attorney
not
to
present
any
mitigating
evidence
was
not
an
unreasonable
finding
and,
in
fact,
is
the
most
logical
interpretation
of
the
record.
although
landrigan
now
argues
that
the
record
does
not
show
whether
his
decision
not
to
present
mitigation
evidence
was
knowing
or
voluntary,
that
is
not
a
claim
that
was
ever
developed
in
state
court.
he
never
alleged
in
his
state
post-conviction
proceedings
that
that,
his
decision
to
do
that
was
not
knowing
or
voluntary.
secondly,
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
unwarranted
in
this
case--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--it
would
require
that
it
would
be
knowing
and
voluntary,
yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
there's
no
colloquy
requirement
for
a
defendant
to
waive
presentation
of
mitigation.
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
enough
if
the
defendant
or
defense
counsel
had
simply
said
my...
if
the
attorney
had
said
my
client
has
instructed
me
not
to
present
any
mitigating
evidence,
and
that
would
be
adequate.
if
a
defendant
chooses
to
make
a
claim
that
his
waiver
was
not
knowing
or
voluntary,
the
burden
would
shift
to
him
to
do
that
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding,
and
he
did
not
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
agree,
your
honor.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
him
to
make
that
argument
and
i
suspect
that's
why
the
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes,
i
did,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is,
in
our
view
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
not
necessary
because
the
factual
finding
by
the
state
court
obviates
the
need
for
one.
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
developing
evidence
that
would
never
have
been
presented.
given
this
factual
finding,
the
state
court
is
in
effect
saying
no
matter
what
counsel
might
or
might
not
have
developed,
it
would
not
have
been
presented
at
sentencing
because
this
defendant
specifically
instructed
his
attorney
not
to
present
any
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
a
district...
the
district
court
can
order
an
evidentiary
hearing
if
the
defendant
has
been
denied
an
opportunity
to
develop
relevant
facts
necessary
to
resolve
a
colorable
claim
in
state
court.
and
i
think
here
the
defendant
fails
on
two
different
points.
first--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
it
has
to
be
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
if
the
facts
were
not
developed
in
state
court.
certainly
it's
the
petitioner's
obligation,
a
defendant's
obligation
to
present
these
claims
in
state
court
and
the
only...
the
reason--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
but
that's
the
point
here.
he
has
not
done
that.
he
did
not
attempt
to
develop
facts
or
he
was
not
precluded
from
developing
facts
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
resolution
of
his
ineffective
assistance
claim.
if
i
could,
your
honor,
there
are
two
different
parts
of
that
question.
first,
the
facts
are
not
relevant.
the
facts
that
he's
seeking
to
develop
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
this
additional,
this
mitigation
that
should
have
been
developed.
if,
in
fact,
his
avowal
that
he
did
not
want
any
mitigation
to
be
presented
is
accurate,
then
these
other
facts
are
not
relevant.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
simply
the
aedpa
2254(e).
i
don't
have
a
specific
case
that
also
would
go
directly
to
that
point.
your
honor,
i
would
also--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--it
seems
to
me
the
hearing
is
directed
at
presenting
all
of
the
mitigation
evidence
that
he
now
wants
to
present.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
your
honor--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
know
that
it's
completely
clear
as
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
can
be
developed
and
how
that
evidence
can
be
used.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--the
ninth
circuit
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
allow
him
to
develop
whatever
mitigation
he's
proffered
in
federal
court.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
held
that
the
state
court's
determination
of
the
facts
was
unreasonable.
and
that's
the
problem
with
its
decision
because
if
the
determination
of
facts
was
reasonable,
it
obviates
the
need
for
any
further
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes,
but
the
point
we've
tried
to
make
is
that
he
was
allowed
an
opportunity
to
develop
his
claim
about
whether
his...
whether
he
made
that
statement
and
whether
he
intended
to
instruct
his
attorney
not
to
present
any
mitigating
evidence.
he
submitted
an
affidavit
where
he
said,
if
my
counsel
had
told
me
there
was
this
evidence
of
a
genetic
predisposition
to
violence,
i
would
have
allowed
that
to
be
presented.
the
court...
there
was
no
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
the
court
simply
accepted...
accepted
as
true
that
landrigan
would
have
provided
that
testimony.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
think
you're
correct.
the
ninth
circuit
has
specifically
found
that
the
determination
of
facts
was
unreasonable
and
found
that
landrigan
has
established
a
colorable
claim
of
ineffective
assistance.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
think
it's
clearly
enough
simply
to
say
that,
as
i
indicated,
even
if
it
had
just
been
an
avowal
by
the
attorney
that
this
defendant
has
instructed
me
not
to
present
mitigating
evidence,
that
that
would
be
enough.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
defendant
wants
to
raise
that,
he
can
raise
that
in
a
state
post-conviction
proceeding.
he
should
make
that
type
of
argument
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding.
and
that's
not
what
he
did
here.
an
analogous
situation
is
that...
came
up
in
a
case
that
the
defense,
that
landrigan
has
cited,
iowa
versus
tovar.
and
this
court
expressly
noted
that
the
time
to
raise
a
claim...
that
case
involved
whether
it
was
a
counsel...
it
was
a
decision
to
waive
counsel
at
a
plea
proceeding.
and
this
court
noted
that
the
time
to
raise
that
is
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding,
and
that
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
raise
that
issue.
and
here
if
you
look
at
the,
the
petition
for
post-conviction
relief,
if
you
look
at
the
affidavit
that
mr.
landrigan
submitted,
there,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
suggests
that
"i
did
not
understand
what
i
was
doing
when
i
instructed
my
counsel
not
to
present
mitigation.
"
"i,
i
did
not
understand
the
concept
of
mitigation.
"
there's
nothing
in
there
to
suggest
that.
so
i
would--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--it's
clear
he
is
saying
that
i
would
have
permitted
one
type
of
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
he,
he's
raised
to
it
that
extent
as
to
that
particular
piece
of
mitigation.
and
the
trial
court
is
expressly
saying
i
disbelieve
you
when
you
say
you
would
have
allowed
presentation
of
that
mitigation.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
he
is,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
further
evidence
that
was
presented
that
he
was
attempting
to
present
in
state
court
regarding
whether
his
waiver
was
knowing
or
voluntary.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
how
do
we
know
we
know
that?
because
of
the,
the
affidavit
he
submitted.
and
he,
he's
required
to
submit
an
affidavit
to
establish
a
colorable
claim.
and,
and
he's
required
to
allege
in
his
post-conviction
petition
that
his
waiver
is
not
knowing
or
voluntary.
but
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
he
just
omitted
them.
i
think
he
was
not
raising
that
claim.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
he
raised
that
as
to
that
one
aspect
of
mitigation.
but
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
him,
a
simple
matter
for
him
to
argue
i
didn't
understand
the
whole
concept
of
mitigation.
i
didn't
understand
what
i
was
doing.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
think
the
issue
was
resolved
by
the
state
court's
factual
determination
that
landrigan
was
not
credible
even
in
making
that
assertion
that
i
would
have
allowed
presentation
of
genetic
predisposition
of
violence.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
would
just
suggest
that
there
is
no
further
evidence
other
than
putting
landrigan
on
the
stand
to
say--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
need
for
an,
for
the
trial
court
to
put
landrigan
on
the
stand
having
already
presided
over
landrigan's
trial
and
sentencing.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that's
right.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that's
right.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
why
this
case
should
be
relatively
straightforward.
because
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit's
finding,
that
the
state
court
unreasonably
found
that,
that
landrigan
expressly
instructed
that
his
attorney
not
present
any
mitigation,
given
that...
that's
the
problem
with
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
everything
else
builds
on
top
of
that.
if
that's
an
incorrect
holding,
then
the
rest
of
the
ruling
is,
is
incorrect.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
the
problem
with,
that
your
honor,
is
that
he
didn't
ask
for,
for
a
hearing
to
present
testimony
from,
for
example,
his
biological
mother
and
his
ex-wife,
who
would
have
presented
the
very
evidence--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--in
state
court
in
the--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
there
is
a
requirement
in
state
court
that
you
plead
with
specificity
what
type
of
claims
you're
raising
in
a
post-conviction--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--ineffective
assistance--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
his
argument
at
state
court
was
not
that
he
didn't
investigate
that;
his
argument
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
was
he
could
have
presented
that
through
some
other
witnesses.
the...
his
argument
at
the
trial...
at
the
post-conviction--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--certainly.
and
that
is,
that
is
the
main
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
that
was
the
only
thing
he
was
asserting
in
his
post-conviction
proceeding,
was
that
"i
would
have
liked
have
raised
this
argument
that
i'm
generically
predisposed
to
violence.
"
the
rest
of
the
argument
i
think
would
have
been
frivolous
because
it
was
so
obvious
that
he
had
restricted,
he
had
limited
his
counsel's,
restricted
his
counsel
from
presenting
the
very
type
of
evidence
that
we're
talking
about
now,
this
other
type
of
evidence.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes,
your
honor
and
the
trial
court
knew
about
it
when
it
made
its
ruling.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
but,
but
the
focus
here
is
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court's
factual
finding.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
necessarily
disagree
except
that
we're...
the
focus
has
to
be
on
what
the
claim
was
that
was
raised
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding;
and--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--except
in
this
case
we
certainly
had
the
trial
court
that
presided
over
the
sentencing
and
had
seen
landrigan
in
person
and
was
uniquely
qualified
to
make
a
credibility
assessment
regarding
the
points
that
landrigan
made
in
his
affidavit,
that
"i
would
have
allowed
presentation
of
genetic
predisposition.
"
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
there,
there's
not
a
specific
colloquy
that
goes
through--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
first,
there's
no
authority
that
i'm
aware
of
that
would
require
any
type
of
a
specific
colloquy.
i
think
this
record--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--and
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
think
the
reason
there's
no
need
for
one
is
because
a
defendant
can
come
in
and
if
he
really
believes
that
his
waiver
was
not
knowing
and
voluntary,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
pursue
that
type
of
claim
in
a
post-conviction
proceeding.
and
he
can
come
in
and
proffer
whatever
evidence
he
wants
to
proffer
if,
in
fact,
that's
his
claim,
that
he
didn't
understand--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
think
that
type
of
argument
was
belied
by
what,
what
happened
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
agree,
your
honor.
and
it's
because
the
nature
of
mitigation
is
so
open
ended,
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
precisely
and
have
a
waiver
of
every
conceivable
item
of
mitigation.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
think
a
defendant
needs
to
understand
the
nature...
the
basic
nature
and
concept
of
mitigation.
but
this
case
provides
a
good
example--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--it
does
have
to...
it
does
not
have
to
be
knowing
as
to
every
conceivable
aspect
of
mitigation.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
he
is
bound
by
that,
your
honor.
and
if
i
could--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
and
your
honor,
l
think
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
defendant
is
now
trying
to
proffer
evidence
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
counsel
was
trying
to
present
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
yes.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
think
that
is
sufficient,
your
honor.
and
again,
here
he's
now
raising
this
claim
of
genetic
predisposition.
the
sentencing
memorandum
that
counsel
submitted
attempted
to
pore
landrigan
as
someone
who
is
basically
a
good
person
who
committed
this
crime
because
he
was
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
drugs.
this
new
type
of
evidence...
and
the
sentencing
memorandum...
and
you'll
see
that
landrigan
had
been
evaluated
by
an
expert,
who
had
said
he
didn't
have
any
mental
deficiencies.
