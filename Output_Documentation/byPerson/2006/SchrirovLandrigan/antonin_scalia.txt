justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
he
make
such
a
claim
in
this
case
where
in
open
court
he
was
asked
by
the
judge,
right,
with
nobody
twisting
his
arm,
whether
it
was
the
case
that
he
did
not
want
any
mitigating
evidence
introduced?
and
he
said,
right,
yes,
that's
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
agree
with
it.
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
been
very
clear
that
it
did
not
agree
with
the
district
court's
determination
that
he
had
waived
mitigating
evidence.
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
simply
disagreed
with
that
finding
and
remanded
for
a
hearing
on
the
mitigating
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
so?
i
mean,
that's
what
that...
one
of
the
reasons
the
case
was
here,
that
the
ninth
circuit
simply
smacked
down
a
district
court
factual
finding
that
he
had
waived
any
mitigating
evidence.
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
wasn't
remanding
for
a
hearing
on
whether
he
had
waived
mitigating
evidence.
it
made
the
determination
that
he
had
not
waived
it,
and
then
remanded
for
investigation
into
what
that
mitigating
evidence
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
clear
at
least
that
they
disagreed
with
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
there
had
been
a
waiver,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
has
not
waived.
not
that
the
district
court
was...
didn't
have
enough
evidence
before
it.
it
says
the
foregoing,
landrigan
has
not
waived
the
right
to
assert
a
claim
for
effective
assistance.
so
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
that
question
is
still
open?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
court
has
to
accept
that
he
hasn't
waived.
and
what
it's
sent
back
for
is
for
all
of
the
facts
that
show...
that
show
he
had
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
criminal
gene
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
all
that
evidence
was
basically
before
the
district
court
anyway.
didn't
the
district
court
know
about
all
of
that
when
it
made
its
ruling?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
new
to
me
also.
i
never
heard
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
kind
of
waivers,
like
waiver
to
the
right
to
counsel,
we
do
indeed
require
a
colloquy,
because
a
defendant
is
not
likely
to
know
what
consequences
of
foregoing
counsel
are.
so
the
judge
discusses
with
him
and,
you
know,
points
out
what
a...
what
a
significant
decision
that
is.
but
it
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
smarts
to
answer
yes
or
no
to
the
question,
you
know,
"do
you
agree
that
your
counsel
should
not
introduce
any
mitigating
evidence?
"
i
mean,
it's
clear
on,
on
its
face.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
the
argument
is,
and
maybe
this
is
what
the
other
side
its
going
to
argue,
that...
that
when
you
make
waiver
of
all
mitigating
evidence,
knowing
as
any
person
knows
who's
reached
that
far
in
the
criminal
process
what
mitigating
evidence
is,
you
must
know,
in
fact,
all
of
the
elements
of
mitigation
that
could
have
been
introduced.
which
will
almost
never
be
the
case.
so
that
it's
always
possible
after
waiving
the
right
to
introduce
mitigating
evidence
to
come
into
the
court
a
year
later
and
say,
"oh,
my
goodness,
here's
the
sort
of
mitigating
evidence
i
didn't
know
about
at
the
time.
"
"my
grandfather
was
a
criminal.
"
"i
didn't
realize
that
at
the
time.
"
"and
now
i
want.
"
--you
know...
"therefore
my
waiver
was
uninformed"
and,
you
know,
we
go
back
to
square
one
and
try
the
case
again.
that
would
always
be
possible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i'm
looking
at
page
92
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
don't,
i
don't
see
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
rather
important,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
effective?
does
the
court
have
to
entertain
a
motion
for
rehearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
your
obligation
to
raise
it
in
your
original
motion
rather
than
in
a
motion
for
rehearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wasn't
your
assertion
even
in
this
motion
for
a
hearing.
it
wasn't
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
giving
up.
it
was
rather
the
sentencing
transcript,
you
say,
"does
not
establish
that
petitioner
knowingly,
voluntarily,
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
present
mitigating
evidence.
"
"rather,
it
shows
that
petitioner
gave
up
that
right
without
thought,
in
the
heat
of
anger,
and
in
frustration
with
his
attorney
during
that
particular
proceeding.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
was
a
factual
matter
best,
best
disposed
of
by
the
judge
who
was
present
at
the
time.
and
he
didn't
think
it
was
in
the
heat
of
anger.
he
did
think
that
it
was
a
valid
waiver.
now,
you're
raising
a
totally
different
issue.
you're
saying,
oh,
he
can't
waive
validly
without
knowing
all
the
elements
of
mitigation
that
the
waiver
might
embrace.
that
wasn't
the
argument
you
were
making
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
belt
and
suspenders,
that's
all.
the...
i
don't
think
any
judge
likes
to
decide
a
case
just
on
the
basis
of
waiver.
this
judge
is
saying
he
waived
it
and
even
if
he
hadn't
waived
it
there's
nothing
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
he
wasn't
bringing
in
at
this
point
the
biological...
by
the
way,
biological
proclivity
to
violence
is
a
mitigating
factor
rather
than
an
aggravating
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
unreasonable
to
me.
he
was
trying
to
spare
his
mother,
what,
the
nervousness
of
testifying
in
court?
that's
what
he
had
in
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i'm
not
following
you.
you
mean
the
mental
health
expert's
testimony
could
have
gone
to
whether
the
judge
should
have
accepted
the
waiver?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying,
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
you
quoting
from?
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
i
thought
you
already
conceded
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
ask
for
a
hearing
on
this
question
of
whether
he
had
waived,
effectively
waived
mitigating
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
found
that
he
had
not
waived
mitigating
evidence.
so
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever.
