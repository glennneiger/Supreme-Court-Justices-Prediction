justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are...
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
was
sufficient
when
he
said,
i
don't
want
my
lawyer
to
introduce
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
trial
court
said,
do
you
know
what
that
means,
and
he
said
yes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
doesn't
have
to
be
fleshed
out
at
all,
unlike
a
rule
11
colloquy.
to
see
if
he
really
understands?
do
you
know
what
that
means,
and
he
yes
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
do
it
concretely,
mr.
verrilli,
for
this
case.
the
defendant
is
being
rather
obstreperous
and
says:
i
don't
want
any
mitigating
evidence;
i'm
a
really
bad
guy.
and
that's
how
he's
trying
to
portray
himself.
what...
you
said,
and
you
allow
for
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
a
knowing
waiver
of
mitigation.
what
would
have
had
to
transpire
in
this
case
to
make
it
a
knowing
waiver?
