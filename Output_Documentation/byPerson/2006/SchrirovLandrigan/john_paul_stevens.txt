justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
first
one?
does
the
constitution
require
there
be
no
involuntary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
the
record
showed
that
he
didn't
get,
there
wasn't
a
procedure
followed
to
voluntarily
waive
those
constitutional
rights,
wouldn't
the
district
court
be
able
to
reexamine
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
separate
parts
to
the
waiver
issue.
one,
did
he
intend
to
say
i
don't
want
to
put
on
any
mitigating
evidence?
but
then
the
second
part
of
the
question
is,
was
that
statement
made
knowingly
and
voluntarily,
just
as
a
guilty
plea
or
something
like
that
has
to
be.
so
is
it
enough
for
you
to
say
it's
clear
what
he
intended,
or
is
it
also
part
of
your
burden
to
say
that
that
intent
was
expressed
in
a
way
that
was
knowing
and
voluntary,
compliant
with
the
rule
that
applies
to
waivers
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
sufficient
waiver
without
inquiring
as
to
whether
it
was
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver,
that
he
knew
what
he
could
put
in,
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
what
might
be
an
awfully
elementary
and
stupid
question?
but...
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
question
about
the
facts
of
what
he
said.
and
you
can
interpret
him
saying
i
don't
want
any
mitigating
evidence
put
it.
but
isn't
it
clear
that
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
put
in
any
mitigating
evidence
at
a
capital
sentencing
hearing
is
a
constitutional
right
of
very
important
dimensions?
and
can
that
right
be
waived
if
the
record
does
not
show
whether
or
not
he
knew
the
full
right
of...
that
is
available
to
every
defendant
in
a
capital
case?
namely,
he
had
been
advised
by
his
counsel
he
could
put
in
all
sorts
of
stuff.
is
there
anything
to
show
that
there
was
that
kind
of
waiver
here,
on
the
face
of
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
an
ineffective
waiver.
isn't
the
ninth
circuit
dead
right,
not
factually,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
you
cannot
waive
this
right
unless
the
record
shows
that
he's
fully
advised
of
the
scope
of
the
right
that
he's
waiving.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
should
it
be,
why
should
there
be
a
less
complete
colloquy
for
this
kind
of
waiver
than
a
guilty
plea
itself?
now
i
admit
there's
no
authority
on
the
point.
but
isn't
it
absolutely
obvious?
