justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
that
the
problem
in
your
argument?
because
your
argument
assumes,
and
i
think
you
said
this
quite
candidly
a
moment
ago,
that
once
there
has
been
a
finding
that
he
informed
the
court
that
he
did
not
want
mitigation
evidence
presented,
that
in
effect
is
a
matter
of...
binds
him
as
a
matter
of
law
for
all
time.
and
what
he
is
saying
here
is
look,
if
i
had
known
that
there
was
this
kind
of
mitigating
evidence,
as
opposed
to
what
was
proffered
to
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
trial
in
fact,
i
would
not
have
made
that
waiver,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
i
would
not
have
made
that
representation
to
the
court.
and
what
i
want
is
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
show
that,
to
show
that
in
fact,
when
i
said
to
the
court
no
mitigating
evidence,
i
didn't
mean
this.
and
he
wants
a
hearing
for
that.
the
only
way
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
properly
win
on
the
issue
that
he
thus
raises
is
exactly
the
way
that
i
think
you
said
a
moment
ago.
that
once
there
is
a
finding
that
he
made
a
statement,
whatever
its
predicate,
a
statement
that
i
don't
want
any
mitigating
evidence
presented,
that
is
the
end
of
the
issue
as
a
matter
of
law.
my
question
is,
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
it
have
to
go
to
both?
because
i
mean,
he's
saying
look,
first
i
want
to
show
that
there's
a
certain
kind
of
mitigation
evidence
that
was
not
proffered,
that
i
didn't
have
in
mind,
that
i
wouldn't
have
objected
to.
and
he
then
wants
to
proceed
with
respect
to
his
inadequacy
of
counsel
claim
based
also
on
the
existence
of
this
kind
of
evidence
that
counsel
didn't
look
to.
there's
a
dual
purpose,
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
clear
that
they
disagreed
that
the
finding
was
necessarily
dispositive.
is
anything
clear
beyond
that?
i
mean,
i
guess
i'm
hesitant
to
say
i'm
raising
the
same
question
that
the
chief
justice
did,
about
the
ambiguity
of
what
the
court
did.
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
they
found
that
the...
the
state
trial
court's
finding
with
respect
to
waiver
or
whatever
we
want
to
call
it
was
not
necessarily
dispositive.
i
don't
think
it's
clear
that
they
found
anything
beyond
that,
but
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
that
could
have,
as
we
said
a
moment
ago,
that
could
have
a
dual
purpose.
one
to
show
the,
in
effect,
the
inadequacy
or
the
nondispositive
character
of
the
state
court's
finding;
and
two,
to
show
relief
for
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel.
and
the
question
here
is
that,
the
immediate
question
is
what
exactly
did
the
state
court
find
with
respect
to...
oh,
sorry...
what
exactly
did
the
ninth
circuit
find
with
respect
to
the
state
court
finding?
and
there's
no
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
that
the
state
court
finding
was
not
necessarily
dispositive,
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
clear
it
went
beyond
that,
and
that's
where
perhaps
you
could
help
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
something
that,
isn't
he
saying
implicitly
justice
souter
implicitly
"i
didn't
have
this
kind
of
evidence
in
mind;
if
i
had
been
aware
of
this
kind
of
evidence,
i
wouldn't
have
given
that
instruction?
"
so
he
is,
it
seems
to
me,
implicitly
saying
well,
my
waiver
was
not
knowing,
in
the
sense
that
i
understood
there
was
this
kind
of
evidence
and
intended
to
preclude
its
introduction?
isn't
that
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the
same
thing,
isn't
that
the
same,
a
way
of
saying
that
to
that
extent
my
waiver
was
not
knowing?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he's
saying
if
you
will
give
me
a
hearing,
district
court,
i
will
try
to
demonstrate
to
you
why,
why
the
state
court's
finding
on
that
point
was
unreasonable.
the
state
court
made
that
finding
based
on
its
observation
of
me
at
trial
and,
and
at
the
sentencing
phase;
but
it
didn't
give
me
a,
a
further
chance
to
develop
my
evidence
on,
on
post-conviction.
and
i
want
a
hearing
to
develop
that
evidence
in
front
of
you,
federal
district
court,
in
order
to
prove
that
the
state
court's
finding
in
light
of
that
evidence
was
unreasonable.
isn't,
isn't
it
correct
that
that's
what
he's
asking
for
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
would...
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you,
i
don't
think
you
mean
this,
but
you're
not
arguing
that
he
just
omitted
the
magic
words
not
knowing
and
voluntary?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but,
i
thought
a
second
ago
you...
you
admitted
that
to
a
degree
he
was,
because
he
is
saying
implicitly
if
i
had
known
about
this
kind
of
mitigating
evidence,
i
wouldn't
have
waived.
therefore,
my
waiver
was,
as
to
this,
not
a
knowing
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
it
would
have
been
a
better
affidavit,
it
would
have
been
better
pleading.
we
can
stipulate
to
that.
but
is
there,
i
don't
see
there
is
any
serious
question
that
he
is
arguing
right
now
that
as
to
this
kind
of
evidence,
had
i
known
about
it
i
wouldn't
have
waived
and
therefore,
i
shouldn't
be
precluded
from,
from
getting
it
in
now.
and,
and
if
there's
no
question
about
that,
then...
then
i
think
we're
just
fighting
about
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
says
in
the
district,
he
says
in
the
district
court:
i
want
a
hearing
to
show
that
i
was
credible.
so
credible
that
the
state
court
finding
should
be
seen
as
an
unreasonable
resolution
of
a
factual
issue.
i
want
a
hearing.
that's
all
he's
asking
for,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
pretty
good
evidence,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
he
may
be
a
believable
witness
on
this
point.
i
don't
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
district
court
had
a
proffer,
but
the
district
court
but
had
not
heard
witnesses,
it
had
not
heard
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
the
reasonableness
of
factual
findings
depends
on
what
the
evidence
is
that
can
go
in
on
the
issue
of
reasonableness.
and
there's
a
universe
of
difference
between
a
proffer
of
evidence
which
the
district
court
says
"well,
i'll
assume
that",
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
actual
presentation
of
witnesses
perhaps
including
landrigan
himself,
which
the
court
actually
hears.
you
know,
you,
sometimes
you
get
a
lot
more
impressed
by
real
evidence
than
by
assumptions
you
make
for
the
sake
of
argument.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
world
of
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
thing,
but
the...
the...
i
guess
on
that
point,
my
only,
my
only
reason
for
raising
this
with
you
is
on
that
point,
it's
not
enough
to
say
well,
the
district
court
assumed
this.
or
for
that
matter,
the
state
trial
court
assumed
this.
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
putting
in
the
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
are
you,
are
you
in
effect
then
saying
that
the
waiver
does
not
need
to
be
a
knowing
waiver
in
the
sense
that
it
needs
to
be
based
upon
an
appreciation
of
all
the
possible
mitigation
evidence
that
in
this
case
might
come
in?
are
you
saying
it
need
not
be
knowing
in
that
sense?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
not
answering
my
question.
i...
we
all
agree
that
he
needs
to
understand
the
basic
concept
of
mitigation.
does
his
waiver
have
to
be
a
knowing
one
in
the
sense
that
i
just
described?
or
doesn't
it?
what's
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
will
nonetheless
kind
him
if
he
comes
in
later
and
says
look,
i
accept
the
fact
that
it's
my
burden
to
show
at
this
point
that
my
waiver
was
not
a
knowing
one,
and
that
there
us
mitigating
evidence
that
i
would
have
let
in?
are
you
saying
that
he
simply
as
a
matter
of
law
cannot
say
that?
or
cannot
be
heard
to
say
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
cannot
do
what
he
is
trying
to
do
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
