unknown
speaker
he's
present
in
the
court
while
they're
making
a
proffer
of
this
sort
of
mitigating
evidence.
the
judge
is
quite
careful,
saying
okay,
if
he
doesn't
want
the
evidence,
i
want
to
know
what
it
is.
and
he
called
the
two
witnesses.
and
all
that
this
defendant
does
is
undermine
his
lawyer's
effort
to
present
the
mitigation.
