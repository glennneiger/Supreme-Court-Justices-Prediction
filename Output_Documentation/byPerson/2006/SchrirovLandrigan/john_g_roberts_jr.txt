chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument--
next
in
05-1575,
schriro
versus
landrigan.
mr.
cattani.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter's
question
highlights
an
ambiguity
in
this
ninth
circuit
opinion,
for
me
anyway.
do
you
understand
the
hearing
that
they
directed
to
be
on
the
waiver
question,
or
is
the
hearing
that
they
directed
on
the
alleged
mitigation
evidence
that
he
now
wants
to
present?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
he
wants,
if
he
wants
a
hearing
on
that,
we'd
have
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
because
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
he
didn't
waive--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
justice
alito
quoted
on
page
a-17.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
what
i
understood
his
argument
that
he
wants
to
raise
to
be.
in
his
affidavit,
it
is
a
different
argument.
it
is
the
biological
component
of
violence.
"look,
my
grandfather
was
convicted,
my
father
was
convicted.
"
and
so
the
mitigating
evidence
he
wants
to
present
at
sentencing
that
is
i'm
biologically
predetermined
to
commit
crimes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that...
which
is
certainly
an
ambiguous
argument
to
present
in
mitigation
at
a
sentencing
hearing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
is
it
just
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
his
biological
pre
determination
to
commit
violent
crime
or
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
waiver
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
did...
the
court
on
page
a-17
ruled
that
there
was
no
waiver.
so
why
would
they
then
send
it
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
waiver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
prior
paragraph
says
it's
because
of
the
history
of
his
biological
grandfather,
biological
brother,
and
biological
child.
that
suggests
to
me
it's
a
genetic
claim
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
he
knew
about
that.
he
knew
about
that
mitigating
evidence
at
the
trial
because
his
biological
mother
was
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
could
that
be
helpful
to
him
if
he
doesn't
allow
his
biological
mother
to
testify
about
drug
and
alcohol
abuse?
what
use
would
the
expert
be
if
the
potential
predicate--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
defendant
would
have
been
happy
to
have
his
biological
mother
talk
with
the
expert,
but
was
unwilling
to
have
his
biological
mother
say
the
same
thing
in
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
think
it's
possible
to
have
a
valid
waiver
of
the
presentation
of
mitigating
evidence
or
is
it
always
possible
that
some
additional
evidence
would
come
up
and
you
say,
what
if
i
had
known
that,
i
wouldn't
have
waived
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can't
give
a
yes
answer
to
whether
it's
ever
possible.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
certainly
understood
that.
he
said
if
you
want
to
give
me
the
death
penalty,
bring
it
on,
i'm
ready
for
it.
the
purpose
of
mitigating
evidence
is
to
prevent
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
he
says
bring
it
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
the
type
of
documentation
that
would
be
sufficient?
he
understands
what
the
consequence
of
not
putting
mitigating
evidence
on
is
going
to
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
established?
that
you've
satisfied
(e)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why,
because
you
satisfy
it
or
because
it
doesn't
apply?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
you'll
just
have
to
bear
with
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
you
satisfy
(e)(2)(a)(ii),
because
there's
no
lack
of
diligence.
don't
you
also
have
to
satisfy
(e)(2)(b),
which
is
to
show
that
no
reasonable
factfinder
would
have
found
him
guilty,
in
other
words
words
subject
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
do
you
do
with...
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
dissent
took
the
position
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
mitigating
value
of
any
proven,
quoting
a-24,
"genetic
predisposition
to
violence
would
not
have
outweighed
its
aggravating
tendency
to
suggest
that
landrigan
was
undeterable
and
even
from
prison
would
present
a
future
danger?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
presented
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
biological
mother's
abuse
of
alcohol
and
drugs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
the
state
trial
court
had
no
familiarity
with
fetal
alcohol
syndrome?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
05-1575,
schriro
versus
landrigan.
