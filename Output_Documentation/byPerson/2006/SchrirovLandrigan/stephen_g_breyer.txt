justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
it
is
incorrect,
if
we...
we
don't
know
precisely
what
he
meant
by
the
words
he
said,
why
doesn't
that
argue
even
more
strongly
for
a
hearing?
at
the
hearing
he
wants
to
introduce,
doesn't
he,
his
stepparents,
or
foster
parents,
a
school
teacher,
the
various
others?
and
he'll
say
anyone
who
listens
to
those
people
will
see
that
i
have
the
most
horrendous
upbringing
anyone
could
have.
the
worst
you've
ever
heard.
and
my
argument
is
that
if
only
my
lawyer
had
looked
into
this
at
that
moment
in
the
trial,
he
would
have
said
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
look
what
i
can
present
for
you.
and
if
he
had
done
it
and
told
me
that,
anyone
would
have
said,
"of
course,
present
it".
and
i
want
a
chance
to
show
that
that's
true
of
my
case.
now,
why
shouldn't
he
have
a
hearing
on
that?
no
hearing
was
given
him
in
the
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
state
court
he
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
is
the
requirement
such
that
when
you
ask
for
a
hearing
in
a
state
court
on
a
general
matter,
"i
would
like
to
show
through
a
hearing.
"
then
he
gives
a
whole
lot
of
affidavits
of
the
kind
of
thing
he's
going
to
produce,
that
then
the
state
says
"no",
you
go
into
federal
court
and
say
"i'm
roughly
going
to
do
the
same
thing,
i
have
a
few
extra
witnesses,
some
of
the
people
say
some
extra
things.
"
no,
you
can't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
he
say
my
claim
is
ineffective
assistance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
because
he
didn't
investigate
to
discover
the
horrendous
circumstances
in
which
i
was
raised,
and
had
he
done
it,
he
would
have
found
roughly
this
kind
of
thing,
and
i
would
like
to
show
that
he
should
have
done
that
because
it
would
have
changed
the
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
standard?
i
ask
that
because
i'm
not
certain
from
what
i
heard
previously...
i
think
the
state
was
saying
that
the
only
issue
that
was
raised
before
the
state
proceeding,
collateral,
the
state
collateral
post-sentencing
proceeding,
was
that
you
wanted
to
present
evidence
that
he
had
a
biological
gene,
it's
a
faulty
gene,
something
like
that.
when
i've
looked
at
this,
it's
on
page
88,
the
motion
filed
says
we
have
two
claims.
one
claim
is
the
claim
that
was
just
mentioned,
it
says
that...
about
it's
from
the
biological
mother,
and
use
of
drugs
and
alcohol.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
joint
appendix
a.
and
then
there's
a
second
one
on
page
88
that
says
in
addition
to
failing
to
investigate
these
alternative
sources,
we
also
want
to
say
that
counsel
failed
to
explore
additional
grounds,
and
that
was
the
sister.
and
the
sister
was
going
to
testify
that
the
mother...
the
foster
mother,
mrs.
landrigan,
abused
alcohol,
and
she
has
a
whole
list
of
things
in
her
affidavit.
so
is
that
still
before
us?
i
mean,
isn't
that
something
you
want
to
argue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
claim
would
be
this:
you
want
a
hearing
in
which
you're
going
to
present
the
sister,
the
landrigans,
what
they
did,
what
the
school
says,
what
happened
to
him
at
school,
all
things
that
are
there
in
affidavit
5
which
was
in
the
state
court,
and
that
the
biological
gene.
and
you
want
to
say,
am
i
right,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
and
you
want
to
say
that
given
all
this,
had
this
been
looked
into
and
presented
to
the
defendant,
the
defendant
would
not
have
said
don't
present
any
of
that,
it
would
have
been
presented,
and
it
would
have
made
a
difference.
what...
is
that
what
you
want
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
with
that
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
is,
we'll
give
you
a
hearing.
we
don't
know
if
you're
right
or
wrong.
what's
the
standard
for
giving
you
the
hearing?
i...
a
lot
of
things
in
the
law
aren't
always
written
down
exactly,
and
i
was
under
the
impression
that
trial
judges
often
give
hearings
on
what
you
might
call
seat
of
the
pants.
i'd
like
to
hear
more
about
it.
i've
been
on
appellate
courts
where
rightly
or
wrongly
we've
said,
i
just
think
i'd
like
to
know
more
about
this.
i
can't
quite
understand
it.
let's
have
a
hearing.
and
we're
going
to
tell
the
trial
judge
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
actually
talking
about
waiver.
my
question
was
just
generally
what
i
asked.
what
is
the
standard
there
on
whether
you
get
a
hearing?
