justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
it
was
authorized
by
the
district
court
in
the
sense
the
district
court
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper.
it
wasn't
authorized
because
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
extend
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
it
is
an
equitable
rule
conditioned
upon
compliance
with
time
limits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that...
that
may,
that
may
be
true
of
this
stage;
but
justice
scalia's
question
points
up
the
problem
of
what
do
we
do
if
we
write
this
case?
how
do
we
formulate
this
rule?
and
if
we
say
that
it's
not
jurisdictional,
not
binding,
then
going
forward,
it
seems
to
me
to
allow
the
hypothetical
that
he
puts
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why
we're
wondering
how
to
write
the
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
looked
at
this.
there's
a
time
stamp.
and
i
think
it
might
be
the
time
stamp
when
this
document
was
entered
on
the
ultimate
appeal.
but...
but
something
you
said
at
the
outset
prompts
this
question,
that...
did
you
think
that...
the
time
runs
from
14
days
after
the
date
when
the
district
court's
order
is
entered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
was
there
a
submission
or
an
implication
in
your
remarks
that
you
thought
that
the
order
was
not
entered
until
three
days
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
an
entry...
is
there
a
time
entry
on
the
dock...
on
court's
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that
it's
a
handwritten
one.
but
that
that...
that
shows
how
long
he
has
to
appeal.
is
there
a
date
when
the
order
was
put
on
the
docket?
does
that
show
on
this
sheet?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
asked
this
once
before:
did
the
document
you
received
show
the
dates
that
it
was
entered
on
the
docket,
so
you
knew
when
the
14
days
was
running
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
says
when
it
was
signed
by
the
judge.
it
doesn't
say
when
it
was
entered
on
the
docket,
when
it
was
entered
by
the
clerk.
