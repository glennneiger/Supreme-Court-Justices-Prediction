mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
is
before
this
court
because
he
followed
an
order
of
the
district
court.
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
within
the
time
authorized
by
the
district
court.
it
was
only
when
the
matter
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
it
raised
that
the
district
court
apparently
had
no
authority
to
grant
a
17-day
extension,
although
it
specified
a
specific
date
rather
than
the
14
days
in
connection
with
the
case.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
the
district
court
put
it
on
there.
when
you
look
at
the
actual
entry
itself,
it's
a
handwritten
entry.
there's
no
way
of
telling
from
the
handwritten
entry
whether
that
entry
was
even
entered
on
the
docket
on
the
same
date
because
all
you
have
is
the
handwritten
entry,
february
10,
file
your
appeal
by
february
27,
which
is
unusual
in
a
civil
case
because
normally
in
a
civil
case
you
get
a
judgment;
you
don't
get
a
directive
from
the
court
that
you
have
30
days
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
or
anything
in
connection
with
this.
so
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
to
rely
upon
a
directive
from
a
court.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
that...
we
did
cite
from
the
rule.
that
is
correct.
when
the
order
came
out...
well,
first
of
all,
we
were
glad
to
get
the
order
to
allow
time
to
appeal;
but
looking
at
the
order,
or
just
looking
at
the
date,
something
had
to
be
done.
and
of
course,
we
filed
on
one
day
before
the
end
date--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
then
you
get
into
certain
time
limits,
whether
it's
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
would
a
reasonable
attorney
or
litigant
rely
upon
a,
you
know,
expansive
period
of
time
that
the
court
gave
to
it.
but
here
certainly
this
order
is
not
unreasonable.
it's
certainly
within
the
confines.
and
you
have
a
specific
end
date,
do
your
notice
of
appeal
by
this
date.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
looking
back,
that
is
probably
correct.
but
looking
at
the
order,
and
the
way
it
came
out,
and
the
fact
that
you
know,
the...
the
rule
allowed
for
a
reopening
of
the
appeal,
just
looking
at
the
end
date
of
the
order,
make
sure
the
notice
of
appeal
is
filed
by
that
date,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
party
who
is
adversely
affected
by
it
may
object
on
that
basis,
saying
judge,
you
have
no
authority
to
do
this,
what
are
you
doing
in
connection
with--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
the
only
reason
for
delaying
it
is
obviously
workload.
and
you
don't
want
to
get
all
briefs
due
within
a
short
period
of
time,
once
you
get
your
notice
of
appeal
filed
in
a
particular
case,
because
you
have
time
limits
for
getting
the
record,
your
briefing,
and
you
know,
there's
a
number
of
appeals
going
out...
not
in
this
court,
but
you
know
there
were
a
number
of
appeals
going
on.
and
my
normal
practice
is
you
know,
file
your
notice
of
appeal
near
the
end
of
the
applicable
appeals
time.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
i
suppose
at
some
point,
someone
may
say
well,
if
the
court
gave
you
180
days
to
do
the
act,
someone
may
say
well,
that
appears
to
be
unreasonable
in
connection
with
that.
i
think
the
safer
thing
is
just
to
put
the
order
down,
say
application,
reopen
the
appeal
time,
granted.
and
then
it
would
cause
someone
to
go
you
know,
go
back,
look
at
the
rule,
see
how
much
time
is
allotted
under
the
rule
in
connection
with
the
case.
but
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable;
in
these
circumstances
we're
only
talking
about
three
days
to
do
an
act.
the
act
was
done
in
two
days.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
this
is
an
equitable
rule
in
itself.
because
it
allows
something
where
an
appeal
time
has
expired,
can
you
come
in
and
show
the
circumstances,
one,
you
were
not
notified,
which
obviously
the
court
did.
the
other
side's
prejudiced--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
that's...
that's
once
it's
granted.
it's
not,
the
time
limit
is
180
days
or
the
seven
day
after
you
received
or
became
aware
actual
notice--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
i
think
in
past
cases
the
court
has
always
recognized
there
are
deadlines
but
there
are
exceptions
to
deadlines.
and
the
most
compelling
exemption
is
where
a
court
says
do
the
act
at
this
particular
time.
and
you
know,
it's
coming
from
a
judicial
officer,
it's
not
coming
from
someone
miscalculating
on
the
calendar,
calculating
the
time
when
it's
30
days
run,
when
is
14
days
run,
when
it's
10
days
run
in
connection
with
the
case.
because
in
civil
litigation
you
are
not
given
any
specific
time
to
do
an
act.
criminal
cases
are
a
little
bit
different.
you
are
told
about
an
appeal,
when
an
appeal
has
to
be
filed
in
connection
with
a
case.
you
do
not
have
in
civil,
when
you
get
your
final
order...
you
know
you
have
30
days
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
i
believe--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
i
think
when
the
court
of
appeals
does
that,
i
think
in
all
fairness,
they
should
advise
the
parties
in
advance
that
they
we're
considering
this
on
our
own,
that
the
appeal
was
out
of
time,
and
would
you
like
to--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--correct.
because
i
think
they've
waived
any...
the
other
side
obviously
has
waived
or
forfeited
any
right
to
object
to
the...
you
know,
to
the--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
yes.
the
objection
in
this
case
came...
you
know,
in
the--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
i...
i
believe
it
does
call
for
a
timely
objection
by
somebody
to
say
something,
rather
than
to
just
sit
back
and
let
it
expire,
knowing
that
someone
did
something
that
they
should
not
do
in
connection
with--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well
i--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
there
you
have
somewhat
advance
knowledge
that
you're
doing
something
possibly
contrary
to
a
rule.
but
then
you
have
the
issue
of
once
you
do
it,
are
you
forfeiting
your
right
to
object
and
claim
a
deficiency
in
the
process.
here
you're
only...
what
you're
doing--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
i
believe
you
can
come
up
with
all
sorts
of
scenarios.
what
i
think
is
the
thing--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--and
where
did
the
litigant
reasonably
rely
upon
an
order
of
the
court,
which
apparently
the
court
had
authority
to
issue,
regardless
of
the
court
making
a
mistake
or
doing
something
intentionally--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
yes.
i
filed
the
habeas
petition.
i
did
anything
in
connection
with
the
case.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
the
first...
well,
we
received
notice
of
the
judgment
on
the
merits.
then
we
filed
a
motion
to
alter
judgment
or
for
a
new
trial.
it
was
not,
the
order
overruling
the
motion
to
alter
or
amend
judgment
or
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
date
was
not
received.
and
the
clerk's
docket
showed
it
wasn't
mailed
out.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
but
in
the,
in
that
court,
there
was
a
transitioning
to
this
electronic
filing,
which
not
everybody
was
set
up
at
that
particular
time;
so
apparently
the
order
may
have
only
gone
to...
on
the
electronic
filing
system
to
those
who
were
set
up,
and
we
were
not
set
up
on
that
thing.
but
the
court
still
had
the
obligation
to
send
it
out.
the
court
found
that
the
clerk
did
not
send
it
out.
the
clerk
found
that,
or
the
court
found
that
we
did
not
have
notification.
and
the
court
found
that
the
other
side
is
not
prejudiced
by
any
application.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well
i
would
believe
you
could
then
argue
that
the
rule
says
that,
the
judge
was
wrong
in...
you
know...
in
truncating
your
appeal
time
to
file
the
appeal.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
because
the
exceptions
to
all
of
these
time
deadlines,
you
have
cases
from
this
court
where
people
untimely
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
a
new
trial
motion
by
rule
has
to
be
timely
filed
in
order
to
toll
your
time.
and
there
have
been
cases
where
the
motion
for
new
trial
has
been
untimely
filed.
the
other
side
didn't
say
anything.
and
then
when
the
ruling
is
made,
the
appeal
is
filed
within
the
appropriate
time.
and
this
court
has
sanctioned
that
procedure
in
connection.
i
see
no
difference
here,
where
a
litigant
before
a
court,
the
court
issues
an
order,
you
look
at
the
order.
and
you
abide
by
the
order
in
connection
with
the
case.
they
do
have
a
reasonable
reliance
in
the
case.
and
in
looking
back
later
on,
in
connection
with
the...
the
issue,
in
connection
with
the
case.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
that's
a
whole...
i
believe
that's
a
whole
different
scenario
than
presented
here.
that
goes
to
the
subject
matter--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--right.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
the
rule
i
always
remember
from
law
school
is
that
parties
cannot
voluntarily
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
court
that
does
not
have
it.
and
the
court,
at
any
point,
if
they
do
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
is
free
to
dismiss
the
case
whether
it's
at
trial
level,
the
appeal
level,
or
whatever.
this
is
not
that
situation.
obviously,
the
court
by
the
rule
could
look
into
this
matter.
the
court
by
the
rule
could
grant
relief
in
connection
with
this
matter.
it's
a
question
whether
the
three
days--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--i
believe--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--i
believe
it
was
not...
i
don't
believe
it
was
a
weekend,
no.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
when
it's
entered.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
no.
it's
a
handwritten
one
that
doesn't
say
anything--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--no.
there's
nothing
from
the
clerk
indicating...
on
the
docket
there
is,
but
nothing
on
the
document
that
was
sent,
because
the
document
only
was
sent...
it
was
just
handwritten
over
the...
on
top
of
the
motion,
so
there
was
no
way
of
telling
when
it
was
entered.
because
you
look
back
at
the
history
of
this
case,
when
the
court
dismissed
the
original
petition,
the
court
had
a
date
on
it.
it
was
only
18
days
later
that
it
was
actually
entered
by
the
clerk,
and
of
course
that
triggered
the
time
for
asking
for
reconsideration.
so...
but--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--that
i
cannot
answer.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
what
i
think
was
done--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--what
i
believe
is
that
this
was
sent
out
by
mail.
so
they
had,
you
know,
the
three-day
mail
rule,
and
that's
how
you
came
to
the
14
days
in
connection
with
the...
put
in
the
17-day
limit
on--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
normally
if
you
are
allowed
to
do
an
act
by
mail,
you
have
three
days,
you
can
serve
a
party
and
then
you
have
three
days
to
file
with
the
court
as
part
of
the
civil
rules.
i
sort
of
think
that's
what
the
judge...
because
this
was
going
out
by
mail...
he
probably
didn't
get...
i
wish
i
would
have
saved
the
envelope,
but
i
don't
have
the
envelope,
but
it
probably
didn't
get
to
my
office
for
three
days
anyway.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
there's
really
no...
looking
at
the
document,
there's
no
way
of
telling
that.
that
is
correct.
there's
no
way
of
telling
that,
and
i
believe
that
was
probably
the
reasoning
of
the
court
that,
you
know,
it
took
three
days
to
get
mail
because
you
didn't
get...
it
wasn't
sent
out
last
time,
obviously
you
did
not
get
the
mail
the
last
time,
so
he
added
the
three
days,
and
then
you
have
the
14
days
to,
you
know,
perfect
or
file
your
notice
of
appeal
to
get
it
to
the
court
in
this
case.
so--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--no,
i
do
not.
we're
relying
to
the
exceptions,
and
there's
a
number
exceptions
on
deadlines
that
have
come
out.
we
have
the
equitable
tolling,
we
have
the
waiver,
forfeiture
issue.
and,
you
know,
in
this
case,
specific
assurance
by
a
court
which
in
a
past
opinion
seemed
to
control
the
date,
where
a
judge
gave
you
a
specific
assurance
that
you
could
do
something
in
connection
with
the
case.
the
old
harris
truck
case
is
where
the
lawyer
was
on
vacation.
the
judge
said
well,
i'll
give
you
some
extra
time.
even
though
they
knew
of
the
judgment,
they
knew
the
time
would
run,
he
said
i'll
give
you
extra
time
to
file
the
appeal
because
you
want
to
contact
the
lawyer
who
was
on
vacation.
the
court
of
appeals
then
said
well,
the
rule
didn't
apply
because
you
knew
of
the
order,
so...
but
that
was
overlooked
even
though
by
time
calculation,
everybody
was
out
of
time.
the
eberhart
case,
they
were
out
of
time
because
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
filed
untimely,
which
under
the
rule
required
a
timely
filing
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
order
to
toll
your
appeal
time.
so
this,
obviously
the
motion
to
reopen
was
timely
filed,
was
filed
within
the
180
days
required
by
the
rule.
the
other
side
was
served.
the
other
side
had
no
objection
to
it
and
didn't
oppose
it.
the
real
issue
when
you
look
at
an
equitable...
sort
of
an
equitable
rule
like
this,
is
the
other
side
prejudiced,
and
obviously
they
are
not
prejudiced.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
unless
the
court
specifically
granted
to
the
litigant
a
specific
period
of
time,
and
you
know,
normally
litigants
and
lawyers
do
not
ignore
what
the
court
says.
at
least
i
think
as,
you
know,
anyone...
if
this
court
said
that,
you
have
a
right
to
reasonably
rely
on
what
the
court
said.
and
it
certainly
wasn't
an
unreasonable
period
of
time
that
the
court
was
giving
in
the
case.
it
wasn't--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
if
you
go
back
to
the
rules,
you're
going
into
the
six
months,
180
days,
and
then,
you
know,
you
would
say
something.
or
if
the
court,
you
know,
gave
you
a
year
or
something
by
mistake,
you
know,
it
would...
you
know,
that
something
does
not
sound
right
here.
and
then
you
would
look
at
it.
at
least
if
that
were
the
case,
you
could
probably
go
in
and
get
the
court
to
reconsider,
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
your
honor,
we
did
not
have
all
of
this
time.
did
you
make
a
mistake?
you
can
always
correct
mistakes.
but
that
was
not
done
here,
it
was
not
done
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
because
they
didn't...
the
respondent
did
not
object
to
the
application
to
reopen
the
appeal,
did
not
say
anything--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well
then,
the
judge
may
have
said
well,
i
don't...
look
at
the
rule.
i
don't
have
it.
i'm
going
to
redraft
the
order,
vacate
my
order
and
put
a
proper
order
on
in
connection
with
the
case.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
some
point
in
the
appellate
process,
because
when
you
look
at
the
history
that
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case...
at
least
when
the
court
then
granted
a
certificate
of
appealability,
you
would
think
the
respondent
would...
what
are...
why
are
you
granting
a
certificate
of
appealability
when
you
told
us
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
or
at
least
from
the
two
orders
anyway,
they
said
they
had
jurisdiction
over
the
february
10th
order
that...
on
the
appeal.
and
the...
then
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
denied,
and
normally
that
would
end
the
case.
the
court
granted
the...
my
motion
for
reconsideration,
and
then
granted
certain
issues
that
could
be
briefed
on
the
merits.
but
once
the
court
granted
the
certificate
of
appealability,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
other
side,
well,
what
is
happening
here?
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
right.
sort
of,
you
know,
reasonably
reliant,
is
it
fair.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
that's
the
prior
case,
because
they
made
that.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
that
is
what's
handwritten
on
the
original
documents.
that's
it.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
no.
but
presumably
you
would
assume
that
those
findings
are
subsumed
within
the
rule
because
the
judge
found
in
our
favor.
the
judge
denied
the
motion
to
vacate
part
of
it
but
granted
the
reopening
to
vacate,
and
of
course
on
the--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--motion
to
vacate,
you
have
30
days
to
appeal.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
he
did
not
make
it,
but
you
assume
that
the
judge
did
by
granting
the
motion,
and
nobody
else
said
anything
about
it
anyway.
i
reserve
the
time.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
if
this
were
a
case
where
someone
just
missed
the
30-day
deadline,
i
don't
think
we
would
be
talking.
we
are
talking
about
a
case
where
a
judge
properly
found,
properly
ruled
that
notice
was
not
given
and
had
the
authority
to
reopen
the
case.
and
we
talk
about
mandatory
and
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
all
that
were
involved
in
this
case
is
how
is
the
case
moved
from
one
court
to
another.
and
the...
was
it
moved
properly
in
this
case?
the
unique
circumstances,
i
think
you
cannot
find
a
more
compelling
case
for
unique
circumstances.
did
the
party
rely
upon
the
court?
here
you
have
a
handwritten
notation
from
the
court,
signed
by
the
judge--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--no,
it
doesn't.
but
i
mean,
i
did
get
notice
of
it.
it
came
in
the
mail,
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--in
the
mail,
correct.
and
that's
why
i
believe
the
three
days
was
added,
thinking
of
the
mail
rule
that
we
have
three
additional
days
to
do
it
in
connection
with
the
case.
and
that's
how
i
believe
the,
how
the
17
days
came
up.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
no,
the
only
information
it
had
was
the
printed...
the
printed
date
by
the
judge.
did
not
show
it
was
entered
that
same
day.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
yeah,
that's
correct.
the
docket
does
show
that.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
well,
i
just
went
off
what
the
date
on
the...
the
handwritten
date
on
the
pleading
we
received
from
the
court.
it
said
february
10,
so
we
just
put
it
in
there.
didn't
go
to
the
actual
docket
to
see
if,
in
fact,
it
was
entered.
as
you
can
see,
orders
were
not...
in
this
case
were
not
entered
on
date
that
the
judge
signified
anyway.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
that
is
the...
well,
it
is
printed
on
that.
but
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
original
document--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--it's
a
handwritten...
handwritten
by
the
judge
in,
in
the
case.
so--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--no.
it
says
when
the
judge
signed
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
yeah,
that's
correct.
but
that's
from
the
docket--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--but
the
document
we
received
from
the
court
just
has...
you
know...
the
handwritten
notation
on
it,
file
your
appeal
by--
mr.
paul
mancino
jr.
--well,
probably
i
could
not
have...
at
that
time,
i
mean
i
could
do
it
now,
but
at
that
time
you'd
have
to
go
over
to
the
courthouse,
just
like
we
walked
on
orders
of
appeal
over
to
the
courthouse,
had
it
stamped
by
the
clerk
there,
and
figured
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
cincinnati.
thanks.
