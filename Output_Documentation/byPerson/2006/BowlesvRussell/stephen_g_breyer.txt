justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
weekends?
i
mean,
maybe
the
judge...
i...
it
looks
from
my
calendar...
i
wondered
what
day
of
the
week
it
was.
you
don't
remember.
2/10,
february
10,
2004,
what
day
of
the
week
was
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
looks
like
it
was
the
middle
of
the
week.
so
maybe
there
were
one
or
two
weekends.
so
maybe
what
the
judge's
mistake
was,
he
didn't
know
how
to
count
the
weekend
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
may
not
be
jurisdictional,
the
weekend
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not.
a
numeral
is
not
jurisdictional.
what's...
what's...
what's
the
three-day
mail
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
speaking
of
the
three-day
mail
rule,
maybe
the
judge's
intent
when
he
signed
this
was
that
it
actually
was
entered,
took
effect
as
of
three
days
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
something
here
i
hadn't
run
across,
called
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine.
this
court
in
osterneck
said
this:
where
a
party
has
performed
a
act
which
if
properly
done
would
postpone
the
deadline
for
filing
his
appeal...
and
indeed
that's
what
happened
here;
he
postponed
the
deadline
for
filing
his
appeal...
and
has
received
specific
assurance
by
a
judicial
officer
that
this
act
has
been
properly
done...
and
here
he
did
receive
specific
assurance
by
a
judicial
officer
that
the
act
was
properly
done...
in
those
circumstances,
you
can
make
a
little
exception
in
the
interests
of
justice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
the
act
was
that
he
filed
a
motion
to
reopen,
which
motion
to
reopen
postponed
the
time
of
appeal.
and
two
things
have
to
happen
with
that
act.
one
is
you
have
to
get
the
district
judge
to
agree;
and
second,
you
have
to
file
the
paper.
so
that's
the
act
which
if
properly
done
would,
in
fact,
have
led
to
the
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
there
were
two
parts
to
it
or
two
acts,
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
that
matter?
i
mean,
also
osterneck
i
happened
to
guess
involved
a
case
that
took
place
on
tuesday.
this
case
took
place
on
thursday.
i
mean,
i
grant
you
the
language
literally
you
could
say
doesn't
quite
fit
it,
but
so
what?
the
purpose
of
this
osterneck
i
take
it
is
to
have
a
very
narrow
exception
where
a
judge
tells
you
basically
what
to
do,
and
you
follow
what
the
judge
said,
and
then,
lo
and
behold,
they
hit
you
with
this
jurisdictional
thing
and
you
didn't
get
it
right.
now,
that
seems
to
be
its
purpose,
and
the
language
is
very
close,
so
why
not
follow
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
notice
the
court
applied
it
twice,
so
it
couldn't
quite
be
the
unique
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
in
criminal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in...
though
of
course,
you'd
have
to
confine
it
very
narrowly,
i
take
that
doctrine,
if
there
weren't
a
statute,
you
read
it
into
the
rule.
so
there
is
a
statute
and
you
read
the
statute
as
saying
well
there
could
be
very
some
very
narrow
circumstances
that
congress
would
have
been
willing
to
make
an
exception.
for
example
it
is
a
couple
of
days
and
the
judge
tells
you,
"do
it"
or
lets
you
do
it.
it's
roughly
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think,
if
we
did
go
to
thompson
and
looked
at
that,
this
would
be
a
fortiori
from
thompson,
as
described
in
osterneck,
was
a
case
in
which
the
judge
simply
said
from
the
bench
look,
your...
your...
the
new
trial
motion
is
timely,
though
it
wasn't;
it
was
out
of
by
two
days.
while
here,
we
have
a
formal
court
order,
it
is
a
formal
order
entered
with
a...
you
know,
stamp
of
the
judge,
and
it
says
you
have
till
the
27th
to
file.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
in
the...
in
this
thing,
it
says
entered
on
february
10.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
says
it
in
the
index,
it
says...
it
says
docket
entries.
2-10,
it
says
entered
2-10,
on
page
11.
on
page
11.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
received.
