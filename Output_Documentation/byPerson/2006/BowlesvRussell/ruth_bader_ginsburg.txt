justice

bader

but
wouldn't
a
reasonable
lawyer
have
said
see,
i
referred
to
the
rule,
when
i
made
this
motion
for
extension
of
time.
the
rule
said
14
days;
this
judge
obviously
made
a
slip.
he
miscalculated.
wouldn't
a
lawyer
faced
with
what
the
rule
clearly
says
and
an
inconsistency
scribbled
on
an
order,
say
the
judge
probably
made
a
mistake?
so
i
better,
if
i
want
to
protect
my
client,
do
what
the
rule
says?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
means
that
a
rule...
that...
14
days
is
really
a
rule
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
if
the
district
judge
feels
like
giving
a
little
more,
this
would
be
no
control,
unless
the
opposing
side
objects;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
respondent
said
he
had
no
reason
at
that
time
to
believe
that
you
wouldn't
follow
the
rule
and
file
within
the
14
days.
so
if
they
made
an
objection,
the
moment
the
judge
put
down
a
date
that's
17
days
later,
the
judge
might
say
that's
premature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
type
of
jurisdiction
are
you
speaking
of?
it's
certainly
not
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
like
a
specific
case
arising
under
federal
law.
what
kind
of
jurisdiction
do
you
have
in
mind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
provision
of,
is
it
2107?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
that
appear
in
the
judicial
code?
does
it
appear
under
the
provisions
concerning
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
under
the
heading
procedure,
court
procedure,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
under
a
chapter
that
deals
with
procedures,
as
opposed
to
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
know
there
have
been
a
spate
of
cases
that
said
the
word
"jurisdiction"
has
been
vastly
overused,
it's
a
word
of
many
meanings.
and
you
are
telling
me
that
the
meaning
of
these
statutes
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
just
like
it's
diversity,
is
there
a
federal
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
amount
in
controversy
is
in
1332.
congress
putting
it
right
there
together.
it
says
diversity
of
citizenship
plus
amount
in
controversy,
all
in
1332.
here
the
limit
appears
in
a
statute
that
deals
with
procedure,
not
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
far
do
you
take
it?
suppose
this
slip
is
not
noticed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
there's
a
petition
for
cert,
and
some
clever
law
clerk
notices
that
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
in
16
days
instead
of
in
14
days.
would
the
court
then
have
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
what
we
were
talking
about
was
that
if
the
order
had
said
14
days
instead
of
17,
then
the
act
would
have
been
properly
done.
that
is,
the
only
reason
that...
the
16
days,
according
to
mr.
mancino
the
only
reason
he
took
16
days
was
the
judge
authorized
that.
if
the
judge
hadn't
authorized
that,
the
rule
wouldn't
have
been
discarded
and
he
would
have
filed
in
14
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
breyer
quoted
from
the
osterneck
case.
there
was
another
statement
of
the
rule
which
goes
like
this:
there
is
a
sharply
honed
exception
covering
cases
in
which
the
trial
judge
has
misled
a
party
who
could
have
and
probably
would
have
taken
timely
action
as
a
trial
judge
conveyed
correct
rather
than
incorrect
information.
this
case
fits
right
into
that
description,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
case
that
i'm
reading
from
is
the
concurring
opinion
in
carlisle
against
united
states.
it
does
cite
thompson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
would
have
filed
that
notice
of
appeal
earlier
if
the
judge
had
said,
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
untimely.
it
seems
to
me
the
same
as
in
this
case.
the
judge
said:
your
motion
is
timely,
so
you're
going
to
have
the
trigger
so
much
later.
fine.
if
the
judge
had
said,
your
motion
is
untimely
and
you
know
you've
got
to
get
your
notice
of
appeal
in
sooner
rather
than
later.
similarly,
here
the
judge
said,
well,
you've
got
until
17
days
later.
if
the
judge
had
done
right
and
said
the
14-day
period,
then
surely
mr.
mancino
would
have
filed
within
that
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
nothing
in
thompson
that
prevented
filing
the
notice
of
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
do
you
think
this
is
subject...
that
question
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is,
this
is
all
at
the
top
of
page
151
of
the
joint
appendix,
right?
that's
the
that
entire
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
was
handwritten--
