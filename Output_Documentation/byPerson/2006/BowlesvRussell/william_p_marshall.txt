mr.
william
p.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner's
failure
to
meet
the
14-day
statutory
deadline
for
filing
his
notice
of
appeal
is
fatal
to
his
case
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
14-day
period
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional,
and
federal
district
courts
do
not
have
the
power
to
enlarge
this
time
period.
second,
the
14-day
rule
was
not
forfeited
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
may
be
raised
by
the
court
sua
sponte
in
any
event.
third,
even
if
there
could
be
some
sort
of
limited
equitable
exception
to
the
14-day
time
requirement,
the
petitioner
here
falls
far
short
of
demonstrating
why
he
is
entitled
to
such
extraordinary
relief.
let
me
explain
why.
the
petitioner's
claim
that
notice
of
appeal
time
requirements
are
not
jurisdictional
contradicts
150
years
of
practice,
countless
lower
court
decisions,
settled
congressional
understanding
as
to
the
meaning
of
its
governing--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--your
honor,
i
think
it
is
its
own
form
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
same
way
that
final
judgments
on
appeals
are
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
the
reason
why
is
that
notice
of
appeals
are
classically
jurisdictional
in
that
sense,
in
that
they
transfer
the
locus
of
the
case
from
one
court
to
another.
in
the
appellate
system,
there's
actually
a
changing
of
the
jurisdiction,
and
the
notice
of
appeal
is
that
triggering
mechanism.
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
classically
jurisdictional
and
different
from
the
other
kinds
of
time
limits
that
this
court
addressed
in
kontrick,
in
versus
eberhart
because
those
took
place
within
a
particular
court
system,
the
district
court
system,
where
here
there
was
a
transfer
of
jurisdiction
triggered
by
the
notice
of
appeal
from
one
court
to
the
other.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
same
way
that
final
judgments
are.
i
mean,
final
judgments
are
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
transfer
from
one
case
to
another.
the
second
reason,
your
honor,
by
the
way,
is
congressional,
is
the
congressional
reenactment
of
the
notice
of
appeal
time
deadlines,
which
also
indicates
that
congress
treats
these--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--no,
your
honor,
but
when
there
is
a
background,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
of
150
years
of
practice
where
congress
has
enacted
against
that
background,
it
is
presumed
to
be
jurisdictional.
and
i'd
also
point
out
that
with
respect
to
this
court's
jurisdiction,
the
court
has
treated
petitions
for
certiorari
as
jurisdictional
in
civil
cases
because
there
is
a
statutory
underpinning,
but
has
not
treated
them
as
jurisdictional
in
criminal
cases
in
part
because
there
is
not
a
statutory
underpinning.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
i
think
the
latter
recognizes
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be.
that
is
correct.
however,
that
congress
and
this
court
can
treat
such
a
thing
because
it
is
in
a...
because
it
is
a...
because
it
does
transfer
the
case
from
one
to
another.
i
think
that
the
criminal...
that
in
the
certiorari
case,
with
respect
to
criminal,
it
might
be
an
indication
there
that
there
might
be
some
relation.
but
i
would
also
suggest
that
with
respect
to
certiorari
practice,
you've
already...
you're
already
in
the
appellate
mode
and
you're
not
dividing
the
jurisdiction
between
trial
courts
and
appellate
courts.
but
the
quick
answer
is
yes,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
jurisdictional,
but
certainly
it
can
be
jurisdictional.
and
for
150
years,
this
court
and
congress
has
treated
this
particular
division
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
it's
more
than
just
history,
because
i
think
congress
reenacting
2107
against
this
background
for
150
years,
that
this
issue
has
been
treated
as
jurisdictional,
puts
congress
behind
this
as
well.
but
here
it's
also,
150
years
is
not
a
matter
of--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
no,
your
honor.
2107
does
not
itself
mention
jurisdiction.
however,
that
is
also
true
with
2101
in
respect
to
this
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction
in
civil
cases.
the
word
jurisdiction
is
not
mentioned
specifically
but
it--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--it's
time
for
appeal
to
court
to
proceed.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
court
in
barnhart
suggested
that
in
determining
whether
something
is
jurisdictional
or
not,
one
looks
at
the
context
of
the
particular
location.
here
this
rule
21...
excuse
me.
here
this
statute,
2107,
has
been
enacted
and
reenacted
against
the
background
of
this
court
consistently
saying
it's
jurisdictional
and
treating
this
rule
as
jurisdictional,
and
that's
since
cases
as
far
along
as
edmondson.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
same
way
that
amount
in
controversies
are
also
subject
matter.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
statute
has
been
enacted
against,
as
i
keep
reemphasizing,
150
years
of
practice,
including
the
edmondson
case
in
1869,
where
the
court
on
its
own
motion
raised
the
matter
as
being
jurisdictional
and
because
the
time
period
had
not
been
complied
with
dismissed
the
appeal.
the
question
essentially
isn't
whether
we're
going
to
call
it
jurisdictional
or
not.
the
question
is
the
effect
of
the
particular
rule.
some
of
the
lower
courts
call
its
indications
of
jurisdiction
or
a
prerequisite
to
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
what
the
treatment
of
this
particular
requirement
is
and
the
treatment
of
this
particular
requirement
consistently
for
over
150
years
has
been
that
it
is
mandatory,
jurisdictional,
non-forfeitable,
it
can
be
raised
by
the
court
sua
sponte.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
the--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
it's
non-forfeitable.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
equitable
exception
to
it.
there
is
no
equitable
exception
to
it
as
well
if
it's
jurisdictional.
so
all
of
those
three
attach
to
the
term
"jurisdictional".
but
i
also
think
they
could
equally
attach
to
the
notion
that,
even
if
we
don't
want
to
call
it
jurisdictional,
if
we
don't
view
it
as
fitting
easily
within
this
category
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
in
day
versus
mcdonough
in
dealing
with
a
habeas,
with
a
habeas
statute
of
limitations,
this
court
approved
the
court
of
appeals
raising
that
issue
sua
sponte,
although
they...
although
in
that
case
the
court--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--it
may.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
however,
if
the
lower
courts
wanted
to
play
with
the
language
a
little
bit
and
call
it
necessary
for
the
invocation
of
jurisdiction
or
a
prerequisite--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--no,
your
honor.
as
shakespeare
might
say,
it's
not
the
name.
we
are
interested
in
the
effect,
and
the
effect
here
has
been
traditionally
enforced
over
150
years
of
court
practice.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
applies
in
the
same
way
that
lack
of
diversity
would
apply
or
lack
of
a
federal
question
could
apply,
as
in
the
mottley
case.
even
if
it
was
in
front
of
this
court,
if
it
was
recognized
in
front
of
this
court,
at
that
time
it
would...
it
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
collateral
attacks
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
are
not
normally
sustained,
if
that's
what
the...
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
so
that,
for
example,
in
a
diversity
case,
if
two
years
or
three
years
after
it
proceeds
to
final
judgment
somebody
realizes
that
both
parties
were
from
the
same
state,
the
collateral
attack
would
normally
not
allow
to
change
that,
to
change
that
result.
and
i
would
think
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
here.
if
the
case
had
proceeded
to
final
judgment,
if
there
were
an
error
of
this
type,
as
with
other
types
of
errors
in
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
there
would
not
be
an
opening
for
collateral
attack.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
doesn't
apply
here
because
there
wasn't
an
act
which
if
requested
could
have
been
properly
done.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--but,
justice
breyer,
in
this
case
i
think
that
what
would
have
had
to
happen
is
that
the
petitioner
would
have
had
to
move
for
17
days
in
order
for
the
act
to
be
properly
done.
he
moved
for
14
days.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
the
judge...
our
argument
is
in
part
that
the
judge
had
no
power
to
authorize
it.
if
i
understand
your
question,
with
respect
to
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine,
this
doesn't
fit
in
because
in
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
the
litigant
actually
has
to
seek
a
particular
type
of
relief
and
get
granted
that
relief.
the
petitioner
here
did
not
seek
leave
to
file
his
motion
of
appeal
within
17
days.
the
petitioner
here
sought,
which
is
the
only
thing
he
could
do
under
the
rules,
is
seek
to
reopen
for
14
days.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
the
purpose
of
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
is
not
to
give
a
license
to
litigants
to
rely
on
district
court
errors.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
the
question
is
when
the
clerk
of
court
would
have
entered
for
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
i
think
the
key
question,
your
honor,
i
think
is
when
the...
when
the
order
is
entered
into
the
docket,
which
is
done
by
the
clerk
of
court.
i
think
that
is
the
triggering
time.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
your
honor,
that's
a
different
case.
the
beginning
time
period
is
a
beginning
case,
if
there
was
some
ambiguity
there.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
again,
the
factual
dispute
is
when
the--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--your
honor,
i
think
the
question
at
that
point
is
what
is
the
time
period
entered
into
the
formal
docket,
and
what
is
the
actual
judgment.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
if
for
some
reason
the
court
records
are
jumbled
for
some
reason
or
another
and
nobody
can
determine
when
that
entry
of
order
is,
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
again,
your
honor,
the
critical
thing
with
the
rule
period
is
the
time
period
from
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
i
think
that
the
question
that
would
be
required
then
was
for
whoever
was
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
to
determine
when
the
entry
of
the
docket
is.
if
that's
ambiguous,
i
think
it's
obligatory
on
the
litigant
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
i
would
certainly
suggest
that
a
litigant
argue
on...
err
on
the
side
of
caution
if
at
all.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
no,
your
honor.
the
case
that
they're
citing
to
is
thompson,
and
in
thompson
what
occurred
in
that
case
is
that
the
litigant
in
that
case--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
thompson
is
the
case,
thompson...
this
court
has
not
relied
on
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
in
40
years.
buy
in
thompson
what
occurred
was
the
petitioner
requested
a
new
trial
untimely,
but
was
told
by
the
court
that
they
had
timely
requested
a
new
trial.
because
they
were
informed
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
new
trial,
they
did
not
do
something
else,
which
was
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
so
the
court
basically
sent
them
down
the
wrong
avenue.
here
there
was
no
wrong
avenue
that
the
court...
that
the
litigant
was
being
sent
down.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
but,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
that
the
court
did
that
prevented
the
litigant
here
from
filing
on
time.
there
was
nothing
that
would
have
prevented
the
litigation
here
from
filing
within
the
14-day
period.
and
when--
mr.
william
p.
marshall
--except
in
thompson,
your
honor,
he
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
proceed
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
if
he
had...
your
honor,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
in
thompson,
your
honor,
the
difference
is
that...
that
the
litigant
was
sent
down
a
different
road
which
was
inconsistent
with
his
filing
a
notice
of
appeal.
here
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
about
filing
a
notice
within
14
days
as
opposed
to
17
days.
mr.
william
p.
marshall
thank
you,
your
honor.
