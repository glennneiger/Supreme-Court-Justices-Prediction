scalia
mr.
mancino,
your
position
here
is
that
this
rule
is
not
jurisdictional.
now,
what...
what
are
the
consequences
of
that?
i
take
it
that
that
would
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
obligation
to
inquire
on
its
own
whether
the
matter
has
been
filed
too
late?
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
if
the
parties
don't
make
anything
of
it,
the
court
of
appeals
can...
can
take
a
late,
a
late
filing?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
but
i'm
asking
whether
a
court
of
appeals
has
to
even
worry
about
that?
if
the
parties
don't
make
anything
of
it,
the
court
of
appeals
can
just
assume
it's
okay
and
go
ahead,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
need
an
objection
or
else
it's,
it
will
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
need
an
objection
or
else
it
will
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have
problems
at
home.
i
don't
know,
you
have
an
illness
at
home.
and
you
ask
counsel
for
the
other
side,
you
know,
i
know
it's
a
14-day
limit,
but
would
you
give
me
20
days?
right?
and
opposing
counsel
being
as
friendly
as
they
are
nowadays--
[laughter]
--the
other,
the
other
side
would
say
sure,
take
20
days.
okay?
so
you
prepare
a
paper
for
signature
by
the
judge
and
he
signs
off
on
it,
gives
you
20
days.
that's
okay
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
other
side's
agreed.
he
won't
object
on
the
court
of
appeals.
and
suddenly,
suddenly,
you've
got
20
days
even
though
the
rule
says
14.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
sometimes,
sometimes
district
courts
take
jurisdiction
over
a
case
that
they...
that
they
shouldn't
have
jurisdiction
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
in
reliance
on
that,
you
go
through
a
whole
trial
and
it
comes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
say
huh,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
here;
too
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
court
said
it
and
you
went
through
a
whole
trial
in
reliance
on
the
district
judge.
district
judges
make
mistakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
even
worse,
it
seems
to
me.
i
mean,
you've
wasted
weeks,
you
know,
in
trial
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it's
jurisdictional,
we
have
to
say,
you
know,
too
bad.
yes,
you
were
misled
by
the
judge.
in
reliance
on
the
district
judge,
you
expended
a
lot
of
time
and
money,
but
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
arabic
numerals
aren't
jurisdictional
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
characteristics
are
you
asserting
follow
from
calling
it
jurisdictional
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
number
one,
it
can't
be
waived,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
number
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
court
of
appeals
has
to
inquire
on
its
own,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
at
least
as
to
the
second,
at
least
as
to
the
second,
i
don't
know
of
any
matter
that
a
court
has
to
inquire
into
sua
sponte
which
is
not
jurisdictional.
that's
the
one
of
the
three
characteristics
that
i
think
we
have
always
attached
the
word
"jurisdictional"
to,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
must.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
must.
and
truly
with
things
we
have
called
jurisdictional,
you
must,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
call
it
"quasi-jurisdictional".
you
wouldn't
object
to
that?
