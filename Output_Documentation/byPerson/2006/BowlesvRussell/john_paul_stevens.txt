justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
person
who
did
the
reliance
was
you,
i
guess?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
correct
that...
who...
was
this
litigant
represented
by
counsel
during
the
period
when
he
didn't
get
the
notice
of
the
september
9
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
neither
the,
neither
the
prisoner
nor
you
received
any
notice
of
the
first
goof
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
i
could
find
this
out
by
looking
at
a
calendar.
do
you
remember
what
day
of
the
week
february
24th
was,
or
26th?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
have
a
weekend
problem,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question:
is
the
order
on
page
151
of
the
joint
appendix,
just
those
three
lines,
that's
the
entire
order
that
the
judge
entered?
it
just
says
granted,
and
motion--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
did
not
make
the
findings
that
the
rule
requires?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
motion
requires--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
rule
requires
that
he
make
three
specific
findings
which
he
did
not
make.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
supposing
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
order
had
been
entered
on
february
10
or
february
12.
say
his
handwriting
was
illegible.
would
that
be
a
dispute
that
would
remain
open
throughout
the
appellate
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he'd
entered
this
order
on
february
12
or
13...
i
forget
which
day
it
was...
the
appeal
would
have
been
timely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just...
and
the
order
was
defective
because
it
didn't
make
findings
required
by
the
rule.
and
i'm
just
wondering,
supposing
it
was
ambiguous
as
to
the
date
it
was
actually
entered.
would
the
party
then
be
entitled
to
rely
on
the
date,
february
27th,
set
in
the
order,
or
would
he
have
a
duty
to
investigate
and
find
out
exactly
when
the
judge
signed
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
what
if
that's
somewhat
ambiguous?
a
busy
court,
he
handed
it
to
the
clerk
and
the
clerk
didn't
enter
it
into
the
docket.
you're
not
sure,
there's
a
fact
dispute
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
view
is,
how
should
courts
resolve
that
kind
of
dispute?
should
that
be
a
dispute
that
remains
open
throughout
the
appellate
process/there's
a
factual
dispute
as
to
when
the
judge
signed
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
had
written
here,
instead
of
2-10>
["],
he
had
written
down
2-12>
["],
then
the
prosecutor
3
days
later
realized
he
had
written
down
the
wrong
date,
would
that
have
made
the
appeal
untimely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
ambiguous,
i'm
saying.
that's
ambiguous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case,
you
then
rely
on
the
february
27
date
in
the
order?
then
it
must
be
permissible
to
rely
on
appeal
to
be
filed
by
2-27?
in
such
a
case
it
would
be
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
and
i
say
it's
hard
to
figure
out
when
the
order
was
actually
written
down
in
the
docket.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
rely
on
the
2-27
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
that's
one
those
interesting
examples.
we
lack
jurisdiction
of
the
case
but
we
have
power
to
order
it
refiled,
to
vacate
the
order
and
have
it
refiled,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
begins
with
the
exception
as
provided
in
subparagraph
(c).
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mancino,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
you
got
notice
of
that
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you,
you
got
that
order
in
the
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
did
you
find
out
it
had
been
entered
on
february
10?
because
you
did
know
that
at
the
time
you
filed
your
notice
of
appeal.
