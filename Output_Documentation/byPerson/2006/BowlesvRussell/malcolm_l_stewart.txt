mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
four
basic
reasons
the
deadline
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
in
a
civil
case
should
be
treated
as
jurisdictional
and
therefore
as
nonwaivable.
first,
the
time
limit
sent
forth
in
section
2107
directly
implicates
the
concerns
that
underlie
the
special
treatment
of
jurisdictional
issues.
it's
a
fundamental
precept
of
our
legal
system
that
federal
courts
should
take
special
care
to
avoid
adjudicating
cases
where
congress
has
not
authorized
them
to
do
so.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
our
legal
system
has
presupposed
that
the
unauthorized
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
an
error
different
in
kind
from
the
misapplication
of
law
in
cases
that
a
court
is
authorized
to
adjudicate.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would...
we
would
characterize
it
as
a
species
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
that
is,
this
court
has
often
said
that
it's
the
fundamental
duty
of
this
court
when
doubt
is...
when
doubt
is
apparent,
to
inquire
into
its
own
jurisdiction
and
that
of
the
court
from
which
the
record
comes.
and
that
division
presupposes
that
there
are
cases
over
which
the
lower
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
over
which
this
court
would
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction.
for
example,
situations
sometimes
arise,
particularly
in
cases
that
are
adjudicated
by
three-judge
district
courts,
in
which
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
a
particular
district
court
order
is
directly
appealable
to
this
court
or
should
go
instead
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
somebody
comes
to
this
court
and
this
court
determines
that
the
appeal
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
instead,
the
error
is
characterized
as
one
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
review
the
ruling
even
though
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
case
as
a
whole
fell
outside
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
is
an
anomaly.
the
court
has
said
on
occasion
that
because
it
lacks
appellate
jurisdiction
it
has
no
power
to
do
anything
with
the
case
except
to
vacate
the
order.
and
i
think
that's
a
court
that
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
explain.
[laughter]
but
i
think
mr.
marshall
has
identified
the
second
example,
namely
the
final
decision
requirement
of
28
u.s.c.
1291.
that
is,
that's
universally
conceded
to
be
a
jurisdictional
rule,
even
though
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
district
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
it
is
simply
whether
this
particular
decision
over...
for
which
review
is
sought
falls
within
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
our
point--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
you
need
to...
i
think
you
should
repudiate
any
conception
that
federal
courts
have
freewheeling
authority
to
excuse
noncompliance
with
statutory
time
limits
for
taking
appeals.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i...
i
think
actually
both
harris
and
thompson
are
explicable
on
other
grounds.
and
may
even
be
correct
in
more
limited
ways.
for
example,
harris--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
with
respect
to
civil
cases
for
which
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal
is
specified
by
statute,
it's
our
view
to
the
extent
that
harris
and
thompson
would
otherwise
support
the
proposition
that
district
courts
may
excuse
noncompliance
with
the
time
limits,
those
cases
should
be
repudiated.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
in
criminal
cases
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal
is
not
specified
by
statute.
it's
imposed
by
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(b).
but
there's
no
statutory
basis
for
it.
there
was
up
until
1988
a
provision
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code,
section
3772,
that
specifically
authorized
this
court
to
promulgate
rules
that
would
establish
the
time
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well
i
think
it
makes
a
fundamental
difference
that
there
is
a
statute
in
place.
and
certainly
with
respect
to
circuit
certiorari
petitions
coming
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court,
this
court
has
recognized
that
distinction
to
be
fundamental.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
there's
no...
no
dispute
about
that.
and
indeed
if
the...
if
this
case
were
classified
as
civil
for
purposes
of...
i
mean,
as
criminal
for
purposes
of
the
time
limit
for
taking
an
appeal,
it
would
have
been
far
out
of
time
under
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(b).
indeed
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
have
granted
the
reopening
period
180
days
later
wouldn't
have
been
present
in
the
criminal
context.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
required
that
they
be
written
on
the
record
but
have
required
that
there
be
a
basis
appearing
in
the
record
for
those
findings.
so,
for
instance,
if
petitioner's
counsel
had
filed
a
document
asking
to
reopen
in
the
time,
but
had
not
represented
that
he
had
not
been
informed
of
the
judgment,
then
i
think
that
if
the
court
had
granted
the
reopening,
that
could
be
set
aside
on
appeal
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
support
in
the
record
for
such
a
finding.
but
i
don't
believe
the
courts
of
appeals
have
required
there
be
explicit
findings
as
opposed
to
findings
that
are
implicit
in
the
grant
of
the
reopening.
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
certiorari
petitions
is
that
this
court's
rule
13.1
imposes
a
90-day
limit
for
filing
a
cert
petition
in
all
cases.
it
is
not
divided
between
civil
and
criminal.
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
90-day
limit
has
a
very
different
status
is
criminal
cases
than
in
civil
cases.
that
is
rule
13.2
of
the
rules
of
this
court
states
that
when
a
cert
petition
is
jurisdictionally
out
of
time,
the
clerk
is
directed
not
to
file
it.
and
rule
13.2
cites
28
u.s.c.
21.01(c).
so
the
clear
implication
is
that
the
court
recognizes
the
time
limit
imposed
by
statute
in
civil
cases
to
be
a
jurisdictional
limit.
and
the
crucial
point
of
rule
13.2
is
not
simply
that
it
uses
the
word
jurisdictionally.
it's
that
it
gives
an
instruction
to
the
clerk
not
to
file
the
petition
regardless
of
whether
any
other
party
objects.
it's
the
very
type
of
thing
that
a
court
will
do
as
to
matters
of
its
jurisdiction,
as
to
matters
over
which
it
has
an
obligation
to
take
cognizance,
regardless
of
the
other
party's
objection.
in
criminal
cases
by
contrast
the
90-day
rule
applies
under
the
rules,
but
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
retains
the
authority
to
grant
petitions
that
are
untimely
filed
even
in
cases
where
the
other
party
objects.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
2107(a)
and
it's...
part
of
it
is
reprinted
at
page
16
of
the
government's
brief.
in
the
last
full
paragraph
of
page
16,
it
says,
the
basic
time
limit
for
appeals
in
civil
cases
is
set
by
28
u.s.c.
2107(a),
which
states
that...
and
then
the
part
we
haven't
reproduced
says
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
no
appeal
shall
bring
any
judgment
order
or
decree
in
an
action,
suit
or
proceeding
of
a
civil
nature
before
a
court
of
appeals
for
review
unless
notice
of
appeal
is
filed
within
30
days.
and
the
significance
of
this
provision,
this
language,
is
it
doesn't
simply
say
a
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
within
30
days.
language
like
that
would
conceivably
leave
open
the
question
of
what
happens
if
the
notice
of
appeal
is
untimely
filed.
this
language
actually
says
if
a
notice
of
appeal
is
not
filed
within
30
days,
the
appeal
will
not
bring
the
judgment--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
so
we're
not
saying
that
the
30-day
limit
is
absolute--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
we're
saying
that
the
rule
specifies
that
if
the
various
time
restrictions
are
not
complied
with,
the
appeal
will
not
bring...
i'm
sorry,
the
appeal
shall
not
bring
the
judgment,
order,
or
decree
before
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
specifically
framed
as
a
limitation
on
the
authority
of
the
reviewing
court.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
are
two
things
we
would
say
about
thompson.
the
first
is
that
as
this
court
explained
in
its
recent
decision
in
hibbs
versus
winn,
it's
long
been
recognized
that
a
timely
motion
for
reconsideration
will
suspend
the
finality
of
the
judgment
and
toll
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal.
and
the
court
in
hibbs
versus
winn
further
explained
that
under
certain
circumstances,
even
an
untimely
motion
for
reconsideration
will
have
that
effect,
if
the
judge
appropriately
considers
it
on
the
merits.
and
thompson
can
be
explained
as
holding
simply
that
where
the
government
does
not
object
and
the
district
court
evinces
an
intent
to
treat
the
motion
as
timely
and
consider
it
on
the
merits,
it
will
suspend
the
finality
of
the
judgment
i
don't
think
thompson
has
to
read...
has
to
be
read
to
stand
for
a
broader
equitable
principle.
the
other
thing
i'd
say
about
thompson
is
that
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
in
thompson,
and
the
case
was
decided
on
the
cert
papers,
didn't
cite
28
u.s.c.
2107;
it
relied
exclusively
on
the
time
limit
that
was
stated
in
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure.
therefore
the
court
in
thompson
was
not
required
to
grapple
with
congressionally
imposed
limits.
