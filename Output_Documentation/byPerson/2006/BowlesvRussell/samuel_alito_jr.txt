isn't
that
just
a
word
game?
it's
jurisdictional
because
it
transfers
jurisdiction
from
one
court
to
the
other.
why
should
that
be...
why
does
that
make
it
jurisdictional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

that
it's

congress
and
it's
not
sufficient
that
it
transfers
the
case
from
one
court
to
another.
so
we're
back
just
to
history,
right?

what
would
you,
what
would
you
have
had
to
have
done
to
find
out
when
it
was
entered
on
the
docket?
could
you
have
accessed
that
electronically?
or
would
you
have
to
go
to
the
court,
