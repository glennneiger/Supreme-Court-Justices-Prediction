chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-5306,
bowles
versus
russell.
mr.
mancino.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
knew
that
14
days
was
the
maximum
because
the
motion
asking
for
it
cited
and
quoted
from
the
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if,
what
if
the
district
court
gave
you
an
extra
month?
would
your
argument
still
be
the
same,
that
that...
because
the
court
set
it,
that
trumps
the
limitation
in
the
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't...
this
is
just
a
notice
of
appeal.
why
would
you...
why
not
file
it
the
same
day?
in
terms
of
looking
at
it
from
some
equitable
sense,
i
don't
understand
why
you
wait
toward
the
end
of
the
period
assuming
you
hadn't
focused
on
the
difference
between
the
14
days
and
the
days
allowed.
what...
why,
why
would
you
delay
filing
the
notice
of
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make...
does
it
a
difference
that
we're
dealing
with
the
safety
valve
provision?
in
other
words,
you've
got
the
30
days
to
file;
and
then
this
rule
allows
you
to...
it's
a
safety
valve,
if
you
didn't
get
the
notice
or
whatever,
you've
got
a
certain
procedure
that
can
give
you
the
extra
14
days.
and
now
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
asking
for
a
safety
valve
on
top
of
a
safety
valve.
and
i
wonder
if
there's
some
point
where
you
cut
off
the...
allowing
an
out
for
missing
the
deadline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
as
soon
as
you
start
talking
about
an
exception
from
the
provision
in
the
rules,
then
you're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
applications
and
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
different
reasons
for
why
it
wasn't
filed
on
the
last
day.
once
that...
it
seems
to
me,
you
open
it
up
for
an
indeterminate
ruling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
justice
kennedy's
point
i
think
is
critical.
in
other
words,
the
drafters
of
the
rule
obviously
wanted
to
provide
a
safety
valve.
but
they
also
appreciated
that
you
can't
have
it
open-ended.
so
they
did
impose
limits
on
the...
if
you
want
to
call
it
equitable
exception
to
the
30-day
rule.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
sort
of
restrike
the
balance
the
drafters
of
the
rule
struck
if
you
allow
further
equitable
departures
from
their,
their
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
your...
would
your
proposed
exception,
does
it
work
the
other
way?
i
mean,
let's
say
the
district
court
entered
this
order
and
set
a
date
certain
for
you
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
only
gave
you
seven
days
on
his
count
rather
than
14,
and
you
filed
it
on
the
ninth
day,
in
other
words
within
the
14
days
given
under
the
rule.
would
you
be
out
of
luck
because
of
what
the
district
court
set
out
in
its
order
as
what's
binding,
as
opposed
to
what
the
rule
says?
or
could
you
rely
on
the
fact
the
rule
says
you
get
14
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
wouldn't
the
same
approach
work
the
other
way?
the
rule
says
14
and
the
judge
was
wrong
to
give
you
more?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
of
that
might
have...
all
those
things
might
have
been
going
on
in
the
judge's
mind,
but
you
don't
contest
that
the
14-day
period
was
not
complied
with?
you
don't
have
an
argument
that
you
complied
with
the
14-day
period?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
of
the
things
i
think
the
drafters
of
the
rule
wanted
to
assure
is
that
there
would
be
a
point
at
which
the
prevailing
party
in
the
district
court
could
know
with
certainty
there
wasn't
going
to
be
further
proceedings
in
the
case,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
180-day
period
and
all
that.
it's
not
open-ended.
under
your
rule
where
the
actual
time
for
filing
could
be
at
some
indefinite
point,
they'd
never
really
quite
have
that
assurance,
would
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
would
be
an
unreasonable
period
of
time
if
the
two
or
three
days
is
not?
would
another
10
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
we
should
have
a
rule
of
reason
rather
than
a
per
se
rule.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
marshall?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
hasn't
received,
just
quoting
from
osterneck,
he
hasn't
received
assurance
that
the
act
has
been
properly
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
he
came
back
and
said,
was
my
notice
of
appeal
timely
or
something,
and
the
judge
at
that
point
ruled,
then
it
might
come
under
that
provision.
but
this
is
just...
prospectively,
he
could
have
filed
this
timely
even
after
the
judge
issued
the
order.
in
other
words,
he
could
have
filed
it
on
the
14th
day.
he
didn't
have
to
wait
until
the
17th
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
the
very
narrow
circumstances
doctrine,
not
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
from
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
sure
habeas
cases
are
classified
for
this
purpose
as
civil
rather
than
criminal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
looking
at
the
rule,
it
does
require
these
findings.
has
that
been
interpreted
to
require
that
they
be
written
on
the
record
or
is
that
simply
something
that's
supposed
to
guide
the
district
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
mancino,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mancino.
the
case
is
submitted.
