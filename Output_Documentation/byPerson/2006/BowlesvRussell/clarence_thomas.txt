justice
clarence
thomas
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
bowles
v.
russell,
number
06-5306.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
1999,
an
ohio
jury
convicted
petitioner
keith
bowles
of
murder.
bowles
ultimately
filed
a
federal
habeas
corpus
application
which
the
district
court
denied.
bowles
failed
however
to
timely
follow
the
notice
of
appeal
from
that
denial.
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(a)(6),
bowles
moved
to
district
court
to
reopen,
the
period
during
which
he
could
file
his
notice
of
appeal.
rule
4(a)(6)
which
derives
from
28
u.s.c.
section
2107,
allows
district
court’s
to
extend
the
filing
period
for
14
days
from
the
day
the
district
court
enters
an
order
to
reopen.
the
district
court
granted
bowles’
motion
but
rather
than
extending
the
time
period
by
14
days
as
rule
4(a)(6)
allows,
the
district
court
inexplicably
gave
bowles
17
days.
bowles
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
16
days
later
within
the
17
days
allowed
by
the
district
court’s
order
but
after
the
14
day
period
permitted
by
rule
4(a)(6),
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
bowles’
appeal.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
where
the
time
limit
for
filing
in
notice
of
appeals
is
set
forth
in
a
statute,
the
failure
to
timely
file
such
a
notice
deprives
the
appellate
court
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
them
that.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
taking
of
an
appeal
within
the
prescribed
time
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
although,
our
recent
decisions
have
undertaken
to
clarify
the
distinction
between
claims-processing
rules
and
jurisdictional
rules,
none
of
them
calls
into
question
our
longstanding
treatment
of
statutory
limits
for
taking
an
appeal
as
jurisdictional.
indeed,
our
recent
decisions
have
specifically
recognized
the
jurisdictional
significance
of
the
fact
that
a
time
limit
is
set
forth
in
a
statute.
our
resolution
of
this
case
follows
from
this
understanding
of
the
statutory
time
limits
for
filing
appeals.
like
the
initial
30-day
period
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
limit
on
how
long
a
district
court
may
reopen
that
period
is
set
forth
in
a
statute.
it
is
therefore
jurisdictional
and
bowles
failure
to
file
his
appeal
in
a
timely
fashion
deprived
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction.
because
of
his
failure
to
timely
file
his
appeal
is
based
at
least
in
prior
on
the
district
court’s
erroneous
order,
bowles
contempt’s
that
we
should
excuse
his
untimely
filing
pursuant
to
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
which
was
first
set
forth
in
harris
truck
lines
v.
cherry
meat
packers,
but
as
we
have
held
today
bowles’
error
was
of
jurisdictional
significance
and
this
court
has
no
authority
to
create
equitable
exceptions
to
jurisdictional
requirements.
accordingly,
we
reject
bowles’
reliance
on
the
“unusual
circumstances”
doctrine
and
we
overrule
harris
truck
lines
to
the
extent
they
purport
to
authorize
an
exception
to
a
jurisdictional
rule.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
