justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
mancino,
i
take
it
that
what
you
are
really
proposing
is
sort
of
a
rule
that
if...
if
counsel
could
reasonably
be
misled
to
overlook
the
mistake
by
the
court,
that
your
reliance
upon
the
court's
mistake
should...
should,
in
fact,
be
respected.
it's
kind
of
a
rule
of
reasonably
misleading;
is
that
about
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that's
how
we
distinguish
your
case
on
your
view
from
the
case
in
which
you
get
180
days
instead
of
14?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
think
is
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
take
it
a
step
further.
let's
assume
it
isn't
recognized.
assume
he
gets
his
habeas
relief,
and
three
years
later
some
eager
beaver
is
culling
through
the
records
and
says,
this
guy
never
should
have
been
in
court.
do
they
rearrest
him
and
put
him
into
prison?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
should
we
repudiate
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
unique
circumstances
doctrine
is
one
circumstance
in
which
courts,
say
yeah,
you
can
excuse
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
the
grounds
for
which
they
have
been
taken
as
authority,
is
it
your
view
that
we
should
repudiate
those
grounds?
