mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
a
claim
of
intentional
discrimination
is
timely
and
actionable
only
if
it
concerns
intentionally
discriminatory
acts
taken
during
title
vii's
charge
filing
period.
and
the
question
presented
in
this
case
asks
the
court
to
hold
that
a
disparity
in
pay
states
a
timely
actionable
claim
for
intentional
discrimination
if
it
is
merely
the
result
of
allegedly
discriminatory
actions
taken
outside
of
the
charge
filing
period.
the
question
presented
is
inconsistent
with
holding
after
holding
of
this
court.
when
goodyear
issued
paychecks
during
the
charge
filing
period,
it
did
not
commit
intentionally
discriminatory
acts.
no
one
at
goodyear
took
miss
ledbetter's
sex
into
account
during
the
charge
filing
period
in
deciding
what
to
pay
her.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
is
no,
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
if
the
employer
was
not
intending
to
classify
on
the
basis
of
gender.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
the
answer
is
it
clearly
would
be
untimely
insofar
as
the
allegation
is
that
there
is
discrimination
today
merely
because
there
was
discrimination
yesterday.
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination
going
on
during
the
charge
filing
period,
whether
or
not
women
are
intentionally
being
treated
differently
than
men,
i
think
the
answer,
based
upon
your
hypothetical,
is
no,
given
what
you've
said.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
alito,
that's
why
i
qualified
my
answer
to
justice
stevens,
because
i
think
that
the
question
his
hypothetical
raises,
like
your
question,
goes
to
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
necessary
to
prove
intent
during
the
charge
filing
period.
and
i
don't
want
in
any
way
to
be
heard
that
there
is
anything
in
our
position
in
this
case
that
tries
to
answer
that
question.
the
reason
i'm
not
trying
to
answer
that
question
in
this
case
is
because
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
except
with
one
small
respect.
if
the
only
thing
that
the
plaintiff
is
relying
upon
is
discrimination
outside
of
the
charge
filing
period,
that
is
legally
insufficient
under
this
court's
cases
in
evans,
ricks,
lorance
and
machinists
before
it.
what
bazemore
dealt
with
was
a
case
very
much
like
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
of
an
allegation
of
an
ongoing
racial
classification
during
the
actionable
time
period.
and
it
was
because
of
that
allegation
of
ongoing
actionable
racial
classification
and
pay
that
there
was
both
a
timely
claim,
and
according
to
justice
brennan's
opinion
for
all
nine
members
of
the
court
of
that...
in
that
case,
a
very
serious
potential
error
by
the
district
court
in
that
case
as
to
whether
or
not
it
had
been
clearly
erroneous
in
holding
that
the
united
states
had
failed
its
proof
of
proving
an
ongoing
intentional
race
discrimination
case--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--because
they
are
two
different
statutes
and
the
elements
of
the
plaintiff's
claims
are
fundamentally
different.
that's
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
petitioner's
claim
in
this
case.
let
me
explain,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia.
in
a
title
vii
case,
in
an
intentional
discrimination
case,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
act
that
is
motivated
by
gender
during
the
charge
filing
period.
that
is
not
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
in
an
equal
pay
act
case.
in
an
equal
pay
act
case,
all
the
plaintiff
has
to
do
is
allege
they
are
performing
equal
work
to
a
male,
and
that
they
are
paid
differently.
and
it's
that
cause
of
action
that
triggers
the
statute
of
limitations
in
an
equal
pay
act
case.
that's
fundamentally
different.
as
chief
justice
roberts
said--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
knowledge
is
a
necessary
condition,
but
it's
not
a
sufficient
condition,
justice
ginsburg.
in
evans,
the
employer
knew
it
previously
had
a
sexual...
a
gender-based
discriminatory
policy
about
whether
or
not
female
flight
attendants
could
work
after
they
got
married.
but
that
prior
knowledge
of
prior
discrimination
by
the
employer
wasn't
sufficient
to
make
the
neutral
action
taken--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--justice
ginsburg,
title
vii
allows
proof
of
dissimilar
treatment
as
evidence
of
present
intentional
discrimination,
but
it's
not
the
elements
of
the
claim.
as
chief
justice
roberts
was
pointing
out,
title
vii
would
prohibit
paying
a
woman
the
same
amount
as
a
male
if
the
employer
would
have
paid
the
female
more
because
she
had
a...
more
degrees
or
other
criteria
that
the
employer
ordinarily
took
into
account.
the
elements
of
those
two
claims
are
fundamentally
different.
what
makes
this
case
untimely
and
unactionable
is
that
there
is
no
claim
and
there
can
be
no
claim
because
it's
the
law
of
the
case
that
goodyear
took
miss
ledbetter's
sex
into
account
during
the
charge
filing
period.
what
goodyear
did
was
the
same
kind
of
neutral
rule
as
in
evans.
what
goodyear
did
was
it
said,
we
are
looking
at
the
pay
rate
contained
in
our
payroll
system,
and
applying
those
rates
as
they
are
mandated
for
all
of
our
employees,
male
or
female.
and
what
goodyear
did
at
the
beginning
of
each
evaluation
period
was
say,
we
are
starting
this
payroll
period
with
the
pay
rates
that
were
paid
in
the
last
period
for
all
of
our
employees,
male
or
female,
no
matter
what
their
prior
causes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
two-year
rule
is
only
a
damages
rule
that
applies
only
in
title
vii
cases.
and
it's
triggered
in
cases
such
as
where
there
has
been
equitable
tolling
or
equitable
estoppel,
because
the
employer...
it
was
a
promotion
case
or
a
pay
case--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no.
what
the
180
days
is
for
is
determining
the
time
period
during
which
the
allegedly
illegal
act
must
occur.
that
period
can
be
tolled
using
a
tolling
rule.
it
can
tolled
for
three
years
possibly.
the
back
pay
rule
says,
even
if
you
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations
for
more
than
the
two-year
back
pay
period,
you
can
only
get
back
pay
for
two
years.
what
is
going
on,
of
course,
in
this
case,
is
they
are
trying
to
use
allegedly
discriminatory
acts
that
occurred
10,
15,
20
years
ago,
both
to
make
neutral
acts
actionable,
and
to
get
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
he
did.
and
he
said
he
raised
her
pay
up
the
maximum
amount
he
was
entitled
to
that
year.
and
she
didn't
file
a
charge
of
discrimination
in
1995.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
what
the
purpose
of
the
charge
filing
requirement
under
title
vii,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
is
to
require
that
employee
to
come
forward
promptly
within
180
days
of
the
date
that
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
action
is
communicated
to
her,
and
bring
that
claim
or
lose
it,
that
the
purpose
of
section
706
was
to
create
repose.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
ginsburg,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
agreed
with
us
that
this
is
the
kind
of
discrete
employment
action
that
triggers
the
180-day
period.
it
is
not
like
a
sexual
harassment
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it's
in
their
brief.
they
repeatedly
quote
the
portion
of
morgan
which
described
pay
claims
as
discrete
acts
subject
to
the
discrete
trigger
rule
in
the
morgan
opinion.
and
that,
of
course,
is
an
obvious
concession
that
they
had
to
make
in
this
case,
because
mr.
russell
would
not
concede
when
justice
scalia
asked
that
that
first
pay
rate
decision
was
not
an
identifiable
act,
that
it
wasn't
an
actionable...
immediately
actionable
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
that's
in
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that's
dealing
with
discrete
employment
action.
it's
not
in
the
portion
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
sexual
harassment
claims.
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question
about
which
portion
of
morgan
pay
claims
fall
into.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
because
justice
thomas'
opinion
was
accurately
describing
the
holding
in
bazemore
on
the
facts
of
bazemore,
because
in
bazemore
there
was
a
claim,
in
contrast
to
this
case,
of
ongoing
intentional
race
discrimination
in
classifying
employees
on
the
basis
of
their
race
and
paying
the
black
employees
less
than
the
whites.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
remand
order
in
the
bazemore
case,
they'll
see
that
the
court
did
not
remand
with
instructions
that
judgment
be
entered
for
the
united
states
merely
because
there
was
a
disparity
in
salaries.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
actually,
the
united
states'
allegations
in
the
case
were
trying--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--that's
part
one.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
it
was
a
compound
question,
but
i'll
try
to
answer
each
of
its
parts.
the
first
point
i
would
make
is
that
bazemore
came
after
evans
and
hazelwood
and
ricks,
and
it
did
not
distinguish
evans
or
hazelwood
or
ricks
on
the
grounds
that
bazemore
is
a
pay
case
and
hazelwood
and
evans
were
not
pay
cases.
it
distinguished
them
on
the
grounds
of
whether
or
not
the
alleged
discrimination
was
taking
place
in
the
charge
filing
period.
so
this
notion
that
bazemore
stands
as
a
proposition
that
evans
and
lorance
and
that
line
of
cases
doesn't
apply
because
they
don't
apply
to
pay
cases
was
not
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
bazemore.
secondly,
we
are
not
asking
you,
and
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
difficulty
to
apply
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing
in
this
case.
we
are
proposing
the
same
rule
that's
set
forth
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
the
court
in
evans,
the
same
rule
that's
set
forth
in
justice
powell's
opinion
in
ricks,
the
same
rule
that's
set
forward
in
justice
scalia's
opinion
for
the
court
in
lorance.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
not
if
he
had
knowledge
of--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
what
i
said
to
justice
alito
was,
if
the
employer
knew
that
it
previously
had
a
policy
and
if
it
knew
and
intended
that
its
present
pay
would
be
done
for
gender-related
reasons
or
racially-related
reasons,
it
would
constitute--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
present
policy.
that's
the
point
the
solicitor
general
makes
in
its
brief
and
the
point
we
make
in
our
brief.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
and
if
the
employer
is
presently
applying,
and
knowingly
and
intentionally
doing
so,
a
20
percent
differential
for
male
and
female
employees
for
no
reason
other
than
the
gender
of
the
employees,
that's
a
present
violation.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
if
what
he's
saying
is,
the
way
we
have
always
done
it
is
engage
in
gender
discrimination,
then
doing
it
in
the
present
time
period
would
state
a
present
claim.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
think
if
i
understood
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
no
present
claim,
because
the
only
thing
you
said
that
he
knew
is
that
they
previously
engaged
in
discriminatory
actions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
sufficient.
that's
the
point
that,
the
seniority
system
in
lorance
was
necessarily
based
upon
an
earlier
decision
that
the
employer--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
duty
was
to
eradicate
the
alleged
ongoing
facially
discriminatory
pay
practices
that
preceded
the
enactment
of
title--
vii
and
were
alleged
to
have
been
maintained
for
racially
purposeful
reasons
after
title
vii
became
effective
to
a
public
employer.
there
is
no
contemplation
in
that
case
that
that
duty
would
require
an
employer
to
investigate
discrete
employment
decisions
made
in
years
gone
by
that
weren't
made
the
subject
of
a
timely
charge.
what
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
is
when
the
charge
filing
period
passes
and
no
charge
is
brought,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
treat
that
past
act
as
if
it
was
a
lawful
act.
that's
what
justice
thomas'
opinion
in
morgan
says.
that's
what,
the
opinion
that
justice
stevens
wrote
for
the
court
in
evans.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
correct.
because
the
purpose
of
section
706(e)
is
to
give
repose
for
those
past
decisions.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
plan
was
facially
discriminatory.
it
included
on
the
face
of
the
plan
gender-based
mortality
tables.
and
as
justice
scalia's
opinion
for
the
court
in
lorance
and
the
footnote
that
justice
souter
pointed
out
to,
a
facially
discriminatory
policy
necessarily
evidences
present
intent
each
time
it
is
applied,
and
that
is
the
important
distinction.
on
the
one
hand
you
have
cases
that
are
both
timely
and
as
a
matter
of
law
show
present
intent
because
they
are
facially
discriminatory.
on
the
other
end
of
the
continuum
you
have
cases
that
are
only
about
past
discrimination
and
do
not
involve
any
present
actionable
claim
of
intentional
discrimination,
and
they
are
both
untimely
and
legally
insufficient.
and
then
you
have
the
cases
in
the
middle
which
concern
present
allegations
of
discriminatory
practices
so
obnoxious,
as
alleged
in
bazemore,
that
the
court
held
that
district
court
may
have
been
clearly
erroneous
in
its
conclusion
that
there
was
no
present
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
title
vii
gives
employees
like
petitioner
180
days
to
challenge
an
individual
pay
decision
such
as
a
denial
of
a
pay
raise.
employees
who
allow
the
180-day
period
to
pass
may
not
years
later
and
even
at
the
end
of
their
careers
challenge
their
current
paychecks
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
the
result
of
a
number
of
discrete
individually
discriminatory
pay
decisions
that
occurred
long
ago.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
if
it
met
the
requirements
of
the
equal
pay
act,
which
is
that
it
has
to
be
the
same
knowledge,
skills
and
responsibilities
and
effort
for
the
job,
then
every
time
that
you
have
a
failure
to
deliver
equal
pay
for
equal
work
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
title
vii
is
not
an
equal
pay
for
equal
work
statute,
it
is
a
nondiscrimination
statute,
and
so
that
you
have
to
show
intentional
discrimination
in
pay,
not
just
the
absence
of
equal
pay.
