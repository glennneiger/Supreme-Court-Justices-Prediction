do
you
have
to
show
that
at
the
time
when
a
particular
paycheck
in
question
is
issued,
there
was
an
intent
to
discriminate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
situation
is
that
when
the
particular
paycheck
is
cut,
the
company,
the
employer,
whoever
it
is,
has
no
intent
whatsoever
to
discriminate?
they
think
that
they
are
issuing
this
pay
on
a
totally
nondiscriminatory
basis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
your
position
that
an
employer
violates
title
vii
unless
the
employer
periodically
reviews
the
entire
pay
record
of
every
employee
to
make
sure
that
there
has
never
been
an
uncomplained
of
act
of
discrimination
at
any
point
in
the
past
that
would
have
a
continuing
present
effect
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
employee
is
paid?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
employer
had
a
policy
of
paying
women,
all
women,
20
percent
less
than
men,
and
it
continued
that
policy,
surely
it
would
know
in
the
present
day
when
it
issued
those
paychecks
that
it
was
paying
women
less
than
men.
so
it
would
be
intentionally
discriminating
at
this
time,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
could
cost
justify
a
dual
pay
scale?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you'd
have
to
have
another
factor
in
the
decision,
which
was
that
you
didn't
want
to
change
pay.
but
cost
alone
couldn't
justify
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
you'd
have
to
say,
we
don't
want
to
spend
any
more
and
we
also
don't
want
to
equalize
pay.
you
have
to
say
the
second
too.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
say
you're
not
going
to
equalize
pay,
you're
saying
you're
going
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you'd
certainly
have
a
very
happy
work
force
if
you
equalized
one
way.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
lilly
ledbetter
sued
her
employer,
goodyear
alleging
that
it
had
discriminated
against
her
on
the
basis
of
sex
by
paying
her
significantly
less
than
her
male
colleagues.
she
originally
asserted
claims
under
both
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
equal
pay
acts
but
she
abandoned
her
equal
pay
act
claim
before
the
case
came
to
us.
a
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
her
favor
on
the
title
vii
claim
but
the
eleventh
circuit
applying
our
precedence
held
that
ledbetter
had
filed
her
eeoc
charge
too
late.
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex
with
respect
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
including
pay.
ledbetter
asserted
a
disparate-treatment
claim
which
requires
proof
of
intentional
discrimination.
title
vii
provides
that
before
an
aggrieved
employee
may
file
suit
in
federal
court,
the
employee
must
first
file
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
so
that
eeoc
may
attempt
to
resolve
the
case
without
litigation.
in
this
case
title
vii
required
that
the
eeoc
charge
to
be
filed
within
180
days
of
the
alleged
discrimination.
in
applying
this
time
limit,
we
have
stressed
the
need
to
identify
with
specificity
the
allegedly
discriminatory
employment
practice
on
which
a
claim
is
based.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
time
to
file
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
runs
from
the
date,
in
a
disparate-treatment
case
the
date
when
the
unlawfully
motivated
decision
is
made
and
communicated
to
the
employee.
in
this
case,
ledbetter
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
in
march
1998
but
she
does
not
argue
that
goodyear
committed
any
act
of
intentional
discrimination
during
the
180
day
period
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
charge.
instead
she
relies,
on
pay
decisions
made
many
years
earlier
and
her
primary
argument
is
that
her
charge
was
timely
because
she
continued
to
feel
the
effects
of
those
earlier
decisions
throughout
her
employment.
our
established
precedence
however
squarely
reject
this
theory,
our
case
has
make
it
clear
that
an
eeoc
charge
must
be
filed
within
180
days
of
the
unlawful
employment
decision
itself
even
if
its
effects
are
not
felt
until
later.
the
one
case
on
which
ledbetter
relies
most
heavily
our
decision
in
bazemore
does
not
support
the
argument
that
she
makes
here.
she
misconstrues
that
decision
and
reads
it
in
a
way
that
would
make
it
inconsistent
with
our
other
cases
in
this
area.
ledbetter
asks
us
to
depart
from
our
precedence
and
endorse
a
special
rule
for
cases
involving
pay
discrimination.
but
title
vii
does
not
focus
solely
on
pay;
title
vii
applies
to
unlawful
employment
practices
generally.
it
does
not
distinguish
pay
claims
from
other
sorts
of
claims
because
ledbetter
did
not
file
an
eeoc
charge
until
long
after
the
acts
of
intentional
discrimination
on
which
she
relies
her
charge
was
untimely.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
