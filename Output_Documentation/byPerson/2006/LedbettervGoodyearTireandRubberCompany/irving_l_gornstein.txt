mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
ginsburg,
if
an
employee
brought
a
claim
within
180
days
of
the
decision
made
then,
that
is
to
not,
to
not
equalize
the
pay
further--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
because
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
is
they
didn't
give
her
a
big
enough
raise,
because
there
was
still
intentional
discrimination
from
prior
years
that
were
not,
that
were
unchallenged.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
if
it
doesn't
happen
that
next
year,
then
that
employee
has
180
days
to
challenge
that
pay
decision
on
the
ground
that
it's
intentionally
discriminatory.
if
she
does
not
do
that,
she
cannot
come
back
15
years
later
and
say
that
a
decision
that
was
made
15
years
ago
and
14
years
ago
were
based
on
my
gender,
and
they--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
in
some,
in
some
cases
that,
pay
cases,
it
will
build
up
over
time.
in
some
cases
it
will
happen
immediately.
but
in
either
case,
what
title
vii
says
is
that
you
have
180
days
to
challenge
a
discrete
pay
decision.
if
you
do
not
do
that,
you
cannot
come
back
later,
years
later,
four
years
later,
six
years
later,
or
here
at
the
end
of
her
career,
and
challenge
every
pay
decision
that's
been
made
up
until
then
on
the
grounds
that
intent,
it
was
intentionally
discriminatory
and
continues
to
have
ongoing
effects.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
knowledge
of
prior
unlawful
acts
is
relevant
evidence
in
deciding
whether
it's
present
day
intentional
discrimination.
but
just
as
in
a
case
where
there's
a
promotion
and
i'm
aware
that
there
was
a
prior
discrimination
in
a
promotion
and
that
was
not
timely
challenged,
and
the
person
comes
to
me
today
and
says
i
want
my
promotion
now.
if
i'm
aware
that
she
was
denied
that
promotion
for
discriminatory
reason
but
she
did
not
timely
challenge
it,
my
decision
not
to
give
her
that
promotion
is
not
automatically
discriminatory.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
understand
that,
and
i'm
saying
the
same
rule
applies
in
a
pay
case
that
applies
in
a
promotion
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
what
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
a
policy
is
if
you
have
an
ongoing
policy
that
is
still
being
applied
in
the
limitations
period,
and
that
your
current
policy
is
to
pay
less
to
women
than
to
men,
then
of
course
you
can
sue.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
a
neutral
discrete
act
that
was
made
at
the
time.
it
was
not
challenged.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
even
when
the
employer...
you
can
have
an
inference
from
knowledge
of
past
illegal
conduct
that
your
present
intent
is
to
carry
forward
that
differential
based
on
the
person's
sex,
but
it
is
not
an
automatic
inference.
you
can
also,
the
employer
could
say
look,
that
was
a
decision
that
occurred
a
while
ago.
a
lot
of
people
did
this.
there
were
decisions
made
that
affected
a
lot
of
other
people--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
i
didn't
correct
those
either,
and
that's
a
neutral
policy.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
under
title
vii,
poor
performance
isn't
a
defense.
it
is
negating
intentional
discrimination.
it's
the
employer's
employee's
burden--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
eeoc
has
taken
a
different
position
but
that
decision
that
the
eeoc
has
taken
has
been
based
on
its
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
bazemore,
and
this
court
does
not
give
deference
to
the
eeoc
under
skidmore
or
under
any
other
standard.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
has
occasionally
happened
in
the
past.
it
has
not
happened
as
a
regular
matter,
or
to
my
knowledge
it
does
not
ordinarily
occur.
the
eeoc--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm
sorry,
justice
souter?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
the
court
rules
in
the
government's
favor
in
this
case,
then
that
case
would
have
to
be
vacated
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
today.
the
eeoc's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
souter,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
today
but
of
course
if
the
court
doesn't
resolve
the
question
today
that's
been
decided
today,
but
issues
a
new
decision,
anything
we
would
have
to
do
would
have
to
look
at
that
new
decision
and
make
a
judgment
about
what
the
law
is
at
that
time.
and
so
my...
my
point
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--to
go
on,
there
are
three
decisions
of
this
court
that
control
the
result
here,
evans,
ricks
and
lorance,
each
of
which
says
that
the
employee
cannot
circumvent
the
limitations
period
by
challenging
conduct
within
the
limitations
period
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
the
result
of
a
prior
act
of
intentional
discrimination
that
was
not
timely
challenged.
a
second
reason
to
reject
petitioner's
rule
is
that
petitioner's
rule,
as
petitioner
admits,
creates
a
special
rule
for
pay
cases
when
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
title
vii
that
would
justify
a
special
rule.
title
vii
has
the
same
mandate
of
nondiscrimination
for
pay
as
for
any
other
practice.
it
has
the
same
180-day
period
for
pay
claims
as
any
other
claim.
and
the
third
reason
to
reject
petitioner's
view
is
that
it
would
undo
the
statute
of
limitations
in
pay
cases,
because
the
result
would
be,
what
you
have
here
is
that
an
employee
could
wait
until
the
end
of
their
career,
or
at
least
a
very
substantial
number
of
years,
and
then
challenge
current
pay
on
the
basis
of
past
acts
that
took
place
a
long
time
ago.
and
justice
breyer,
you
talked
about
it
being
limited
to
just
back
pay
during
the
two-year
period.
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
have
not
decided
whether
it's
the
180-day
period
or
the
two-year
period
if
you
buy
petitioner's
theory,
i
don't
think
he
has
either.
but
the
important
additional
point
of
order
is
you're
still
hinging
liability
on
past
acts
long
ago
and
you're
adding
the
possibility
of
compensatory
relief
and
punitive
damages,
so
it's
not
the
limited
damage
award
that
you're
contemplating
necessarily.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well
in
some...
if
she's
denied
a
pay
raise
and
she's
aware
that
other
people
are
getting
substantial
pay
raises...
i
don't
think
it's
that
much
different
than
somebody
else
getting
the
promotion
and
me
not
getting
that
promotion.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
to
the
extent
that
you
want
to
address
equitable
tolling.
that's
the
question,
should
there
be
equitable
tolling
until
such
time
as
she's
aware
of
the
disparity.
but
what
petitioner's
theory
does
is
says
even
after
the
employee
is
aware
of
the
disparity
she
can
wait
15
more
years
and
then
sue.
