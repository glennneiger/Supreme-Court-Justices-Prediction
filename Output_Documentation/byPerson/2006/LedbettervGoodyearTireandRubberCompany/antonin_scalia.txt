i
don't
really
see
a
vast
difference
between
a
promotion
and
being
elevated
to
a
higher
pay
grade.
i
mean,
there
may
be
no
different
responsibilities
but
it's
a
single
act
of
discrimination:
"no,
you're
not
going
to
move
up
to
the
next
pay
level.
"
i
don't
see
why
that's
different
from
"no,
you're
not
going
to
move
up
to
the
next
job.
"
justice

how
does,
how
does
time
solve
that
difficulty?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that,
but
that
would
not
be
the
result
if
the
reason
for
the
disparity
between
4
percent
and
5
percent
was
not
a,
a
denial
of
a
pay
increase
to
a
higher
pay
level,
but
rather
denial
of
a
promotion
to
another
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
were
the
case,
then
it
washes
out
and
you
have
to
challenge
it
right
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
call
it
a
secondary
effect
but
the
only
reason
you
want
to
get
promoted
to
another
job
is
to
get
more
money.
i
think
it's
a
primary
effect.

so
you
too
then
have
to
go,
unless
you
can
find
a
present
policy
to
discriminate
on
sex,
you
too
in
your
proof
have
to
go
back
whatever
it
may
be,
you
know,
the
15
or
20
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nager,
why
did
it
make
any
sense
to
treat
this
area
any
different
from
the
equal
pay
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
why
should
we
listen
to
the
solicitor
general
rather
than
the
eeoc?
i
mean,
they
have
taken
a
different
position
from
the
one
that
you're
urging
upon
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
touche.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
their
action
is
just
based
on
bazemore
or
their
reading
of
bazemore?
