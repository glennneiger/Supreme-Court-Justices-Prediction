justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
understand
one
of
your
answers.
supposing
that
today
the
management
does
not
know
of
the
prior
discrimination.
just,
records
that
have
been
lost,
it
happened
a
long
time
ago.
but
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
a
firm
policy
that
women
get
20
percent
less
than
men
forever
and
it's
still...
that
policy
has
continued
up
to
date,
but
that
these
people
making
the
decision
today
did
not
know
that.
would
there
be
liability
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
the
other.
that's
why
i
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
this
question.
supposing
in
the
annual
review
before
a
promotion
is
concerned
the
officer
making
the
recommendation
was
instructed
not
only
to
decide
what
increase
would
be
appropriate
but
also
to
review
past
history
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
employee
was
being
paid
fairly
in
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
and
that
was
part
of
the
assignment.
would
you
have
a
case
if
that
were
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
couldn't
rely
on
the
past
history
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
think
that's
sort
of
what
justice...
judge
jofla
thought
was
going
on
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
can
i
test
your
theory
with
a
hypothetical
question?
supposing
20
years
ago,
there
was
an
actual
written
policy
statement,
we
pay
women
20
percent
less
than
men.
and
that
was
written
up
and
everybody
knew
it.
and
then
nothing
changed
for
the
next
20
years,
and
the
person
then
sued
today.
would
she
be...
and
there
was
no
intent
to
do
anything,
this
is
just
the
way
it's
always
been.
would
she
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
present
intent
was
merely
to
do
what
we
have
always
done,
you
have
to
go
back
20
years
to
find
out
that
what
we
have
always
done
is
the
result
of
a
policy
decision
made
20
years
ago
that
we
can
hire
women
at
a
less
expense
than
men
so
we
will
continue
to
pay
the
same
rate.
would
the
per
paycheck
rule
apply
to
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
slight
difference
in
that
you're
focused
on
whether
discrimination
occurred
within
the
180-day
period.
and
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
discrimination
would
have
occurred
during
the
180-day
period
if
the
employer
knew
of
the
policy
that
i
described,
because
then
he
would
be
knowingly
paying
less.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
alito
made
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
of
whether
just
knowing
that
that's
a
source
of
the
policy
would
be
a
gender-related
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
my
hypothetical
there
was
a
policy
established
20
years
ago,
a
20
percent
differential,
never
been
changed.
and
the
only
question
that
would
differ,
in
some
cases
the
employer
knows
about
it
and
in
some
others
he
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
his
reason
is,
this
is
always
the
way
we
did
it.
that's
his
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
could
if
the
person
making
the
decision
was
aware
of
the
discriminatory
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
changing
the
hypothetical.
my
hypothetical
was
simply
a
pay
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying,
i
think
contrary
to
your
colleague
if
i
remember
correctly,
that
even
if
the
employer
knew
of
the
20
percent
differential
policy
established
20
years
ago,
it
could
still
carry
it
into
effect
today.
