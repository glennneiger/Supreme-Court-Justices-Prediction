mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
jury
found
that
at
the
time
petitioner
filed
for
charge
of
discrimination
with
the
eeoc,
respondent
was
paying
her
less
for
each
week's
work
than
it
paid
similarly
situated
male
employees
and
that
it
did
so
because
of
her
sex.
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
that
present
act
of
disparate
treatment
because
of
sex
constituted
a
present
violation
of
title
vii.
this
court
has
already
answered
that
question.
consistent
with
the
law's
traditional
treatment
of
pay
as
arising
from
recurring
transactions
and
giving
rise
to
recurring
causes
of
action,
and
consistent
with
the
paycheck
accrual
rule
everyone
agrees
congress
adopted
for
the
equal
pay
act,
this
court
in
bazemore
versus
friday
held
under
title
vii,
each
week's
paycheck
that
offers
less
to
an
employee
because
of
her
race
or
sex--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it...
it
is.
for
example,
the
respondents
give
the
example
of
promotion
decisions
but
we
think
that
there
are
analytical
and
well
as
practical
and
historical
distinctions
that
congress,
that
led
congress
to
treat
pay
differently.
as
a
practical
matter,
while
it's
always
the
case
or
almost
always
the
case
that
somebody
knows
they
have
been
subject
to
disparate
treatment
in
a
promotion
case...
they
know
that
they
didn't
get
the
promotion
and
somebody
else
did...
it
is
frequently
possible
for
an
employee
to
be
subject
to
disparate
pay
without
ever
knowing
that
she
has
been
treated
differently
than
anybody
else.
and
certainly--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes.
yes.
a
promotion...
discrimination
in
promotion
is
different
analytically
than
with
discrimination
with
respect
to
pay
decisions
themselves.
because
in
a
promotion
decision
the
employee
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
take
on
added
responsibilities
and
therefore
earn
more
pay,
but
in,
but
the
pay
itself
is
not
discriminatory
in
the
sense
of
treating
people
doing
the
same
work
differently.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
because,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
when
somebody
is
denied
a
promotion
for
discriminatory
reasons
the
paychecks
themselves
are
not
discriminatory.
they
treat
similarly
situated
workers
differently.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes,
and
that
practical
distinction
i
think
does
support
congress's
decision
under
the
equal
pay
act
as
well
as
under
title
vii
to
choose
a
paycheck
accrual
rule
because
it's
frequently
that
even
if
an
employee
knows
she
has
been
subject
to
disparate
pay,
it's
frequently
very
difficult
for
her
to
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
that
pay
is
intentionally
discriminatory
without
more
information.
so
for
example,
if
you
look
at
that
chart
on
page
174
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
summarizes
the
pay
decisions
for
one
of
the
years
at
issue
here,
if
petitioner
knew
only
the
pay
raise
that
she
got
that
year,
she
would
know
that
she
got
a
5.28
percent
raise
which
is
not...
which
is
not
suspicious.
if
she
knew
what
mr.
conte
had
gotten,
she
would
know
that
in
fact
that
pay
raise
decision
decreased
the
disparity
between
her
pay
and
mr.
conte's
pay.
if
she
knew
what
also
happened
with
respect
to
mr.
bice
she
would
see
he
got
a
higher
absolute
raise
than
he
did,
but
she
got
a
bigger
one
than
todd.
it's
only
if
petitioner
had
all
of
the
information
in
this
chart,
that
she
would
know
that
that
pay
raise
decision
increased
the
overall
disparity
between
her
wages
and
the
average
wages
of
men
doing
the
same
job.
and
even
then
the
amount
of
that
disparity,
standing
alone
wouldn't
provide
a
sufficient
reason
to
go
claim
intentional
discrimination
to
the
eeoc.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it's
only
after...
one
would
expect
in
a
merit
system
that
there
would
be
some
level
of
variation
in
the
area
and
that
would
work
out
over
time.
it's
only
when
it
doesn't,
when
the
disparity
persists,
when
the
different
treatment
accrues
again
and
again
and
the
overall
disparity
in
the
wages
increases,
that
the
employee
has
some
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
it's
not
natural
variation
in
the
pay
decisions
but
actually
intentional
discrimination.
in
the
paycheck
accrual
rule
that's
been
applied
by
the
lower
courts
for
more
than
20
years
without
incident,
adequately
balances
the
interest
of
employees
and
being
able
to
come
forward
once
they
find
out
that
there
is
a
reason
to
suspect
discrimination,
with
an
employer's
reasonable
interest
in
avoiding
having
to
defend
stale
claims.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
equal
pay
act,
which
everybody
agrees
has
a
paycheck
accrual
rule,
imposes
all
of
the
same
burdens
on
employers
that
respondents
allege
would
have
led
congress
to
never
impose
a
paycheck
accrual
under
title
vii.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
did.
the
magistrate
judge
initially
recommended
dismissing
both
the
title
vii
and
equal
pay
claims
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
disparity.
the
district
courts
held
that
there
were
fact
disputes
that
precluded
that
conclusion,
but
for
some
reason
only
reinstated
the
title
vii
claim.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
we
should
have
objected
to
the
failure
to
reinstate
the
equal
pay
act
claim.
we
didn't;
we
didn't
think
it
was
that
important
and
the
time
because
we
still
had
the
title
vii
claim.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
it's
essentially
the
same
case
kind
of
case
in
each
instance.
although
the
jury
has
to
find
intentional
discrimination
in
the
title
vii
case;
under
the
equal
pay
act
the
jury
has
to
determine
whether
the
employer
has
shown
that
the
present
disparity
is
the
result
of
some
factor
other
than
sex.
and
so
in
both
cases,
the
jury
always
has
to
consider
the
basis
of
prior
decisions
that
are
the
cause
of
the
present
disparity.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
the
execution
of
a
prior
discriminatory
decision
constitutes
a
present
violation
of
title
vii.
it's
frequently--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
still
constitutes
a
violation
because
they
are
executing
a
present
disparity
that
is
because
of
sex
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
that
kind
of
claim
would
be
timely
under
section
706.
the
employer
would
have
an
awfully
good
laches
defense.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
would
depend
on
the
general
rules
for
attributing
a
liability
from
a
successful--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
would
think
that
they
are
still
responsible
in
the
same
way
that
they
are
responsible
for
other
actions
that
the
prior
company
took.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
correct.
and
we
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
that
it
does
for
the
reason
that
i
said
before,
that
that
kind
of
consequence
is
a
secondary
effect
of
the
prior
unlawful
employment
practice,
but
under
evans,
which
that
kind
of
problem
goes
to--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well
even
if
the
court
didn't
think
that
this
is
a
completely
satisfactory
analytical
line
to
draw,
as
i
said
before
there
are
good
practical
reasons
for
drawing
it,
and
every
reason
to
think
that
congress
did
draw
it,
because
congress
enacted
this
statute
against
the
background
legal
principle
that
pay,
that
the
pay
aspects
of
the
employment
relationship
arise
out
of
recurring
transactions
and
give
rise
to
recurring
causes
of
action.
and
that's
the
rule
that
everybody
acknowledges
congress
adopted
under
the
equal
pay
act.
and
to
hold
that
there
is
a
different
rule
under
title
vii
would
for
example
lead
to
the
anomalous
proposition
that
congress
intended
to
permit
women,
a
white
woman
in
1967
to
challenge
the
present
disparity
in
her
pay,
but
not
a
black
man
under
title
vii
because
the
discrimination
there
was
racial.
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
the
two
acts
to
perform
in
such
dramatically
different
ways.
in
fact--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
it
didn't
have
the
same
elements,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
difference
in
the
elements--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that's
right.
and
as
a
result
the
claims
and
the
process
of
adjudicating
both
kinds
of
claims
are
not
significantly
different.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there
is
a
provision
of
title
vii
that
limits
back
pay
to
at
most
2
years.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
absolutely
right,
and
in
fact
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
such
claims
are
particularly
common.
this
has
been
the
rule
in
effect
for
20
years
in
the
lower
courts
and
respondent
is
unable
to
show
any
actual
evidence
that
these
kinds
of
claims
are
common.
but
much
more
common
are
instances
in
which
an
employee
has
no
reasonable
basis
for
filing
a
charge
of
discrimination
within
180
days
of
the
disparity.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
they
can
certainly
make
that
allegation,
but
the
employer
is
left
open
to
avail
itself
of
the
equitable
defenses
and
they'll
have
a
very
easy
time
of
showing
that
there's
been
undue
delay.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
in
that
case--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
do
acknowledge
that
a
traditional
laches
defense
would
be
more
difficult
than
those--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes,
and
it's
only
after
that
same
kind
of
decision
has
been
repeated
over
a
number
of
years
that
you
actually
have
a
case
that
you
can
bring
to
the
eeoc.
but
under
respondent's
view
by
that
time
it's
too
late.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true,
but
the
practical--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that's
true,
but
the
paycheck
accrual
rule
also
serves
the
function
of
the
much
more
common
case
in
which
somebody
doesn't
derive
notice
of
the
potential
discrimination
until
the
discrimination
has
been
repeated
over
time.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
they
certainly
have
an
incentive
to
do
that
under
both
the
equal
pay
act,
which
everybody
acknowledges
puts
the
employer
subject
to
liability
for
any
present
disparity
based
on
any
prior
decision
that
can't
be
justified
as
based
on
some
factor
other
than
sex,
and
that
incentive
has
been
around
for
a
very
long
time
and
respondents
aren't
able
to
show
that
that's
been
an
unmanageable
burden.
but
employers
as
a
matter
of
basic
agency
law
know
from
the
very
beginning
whether
or
not
they've
been
paying
the
plaintiff
less
because
of
her
sex.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
because
this
court
made
clear
as
recently
faragher
that
when
an
employer
delegates
pay-setting
authority
to
a
supervisor
the
discrimination
undertaken
by
that
supervisor
is
imputed
to
the
employer
as
a
matter
of
agency
law
principles.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
proof
that
the
act
is
discriminatory
is
any
more
difficult
or
any
more
difficult
in
concept
when
it
happened
several
years
ago
than
when
it
happened
180
days
ago.
it's
still
the
employer...
the
employee
still
has
to
show
that
the
present
disparity
is
because
of
sex.
and
the
fact
that
it
may
be
more
difficult
as
a
practical
matter
is
something
that
the
court
can
take
into
account
under
a
laches
defense.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
it's
enough
that
the
employer
knows
as
a
matter
of
basic
agency
law
that
the
petitioner
is
being
paid
less
because
of
her
sex,
because
of
prior
discriminatory
decisions.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true.
she
did
get
a
higher
raise
that
year
and
that
was
his
testimony.
he
also
testified
that
he
had
told
her
differently,
that
she
had
done
a
very
good
job
that
year
and
that's
why
she
had
gotten
it,
and
the
jury
was
entitled
to
believe
that.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there
would.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
apologize
if
i
was
unclear
about
that.
there
would
be
liability,
and
basic
agency
law
principles
impute
to
the
employer
those
prior
decisions.
so
it's
not
possible
for
goodyear
as
a
matter
of
law
to
claim
that
it
did
not
know
about
those
decisions
when
they
occurred,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
principle
of
agency
law--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
may
be
a
defense.
i'm
not
quite
certain
how
agency
law
principles
apply
in
that
circumstance
when
there's
been
a
change
of
ownership.
but
certainly
when
there
hasn't
been
it's
not
unfair
to
the
employer
to
say
that
so
long
as
you
base
present
pay
on
long
past
decisions
it's
your
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
that
present
pay
is
not
discriminatory.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true,
that
they
have
an
incentive
to
do
so.
they
also
have
that
incentive
concededly
under
the
equal
pay
act
and
nothing
in
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
going
to
remove
that
incentive
or
that
burden.
and
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
find
that
burden
inappropriate
under
the
equal
pay
act
is
good
reason
to
think
that
congress
wouldn't
have
thought
it
was
inappropriate
here.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
that's
not
our
position.
we
have
to
prove
in
addition
that
that
disparity
is
because
of
sex,
which
necessarily--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes,
and
the
longer
that
an
employee
waits
the
longer
it
is
for
her
to
sustain
her
burden
of
proof
on
that
score.
and
in
fact--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--but
if
the
employer
can
show
in
fact
that
there
is
a
disadvantage,
that
there
is
prejudice,
it
can
ask
the
court
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
claim
or
eliminate
it
entirely
under
an
equitable
defense
such
as
laches.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
struggled
with
this
question
when
does
the
unlawful
employment
practice
occur
in
a
disparate
pay
case.
this
court
confronted
precisely
that
question
in
bazemore
and
held
that...
and
rejected
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
in
that
case
that
the
present
payment
of
a
disparate
wage
was
simply
a
consequence
and
not
in
itself
a
present
violation
of
title
vii?
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent.
there
was
present
discrimination.
there
was,
people
were
being
paid
less
and
it
was
because
of
their
race.
it
just
so
happened
that
the
because
of
their
race
was
based
on
a
decision
that
was
made
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
i
don't
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
was
going
on
in
bazemore.
recall,
for
example,
that
there
were
plaintiffs
in
bazemore--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
i
thought...
i'd
take
the
footnote
in
lorance,
if
that's
what
you're
referring
to,
to
simply
say
that,
like
a
facially
discriminatory
pay
policy
which
discriminates
every
time
it's
implemented,
a
facially
discriminatory
seniority
policy
that
discriminates
every
time
it's
implemented,
the
court
was...
considered
in
bazemore
a
similar
kind
of
recurring
violation
because,
just
like
a
facially
discriminatory
policy,
a
discriminatory
pay
structure
or
pay
decision
treats
differently...
similarly
situated
people
differently
every
time
it's
implemented.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
think
that
it
is.
for
example,
remember
that
in
bazemore
there
were
plaintiffs,
workers
who
were
hired
after
the
merger,
after
1965,
and
when
they
were
hired
they
were
paid
the
same
rate
as
the
white
employees,
and
the
disparity
in
their
wages
in
1972
arose
solely
because
of
the
discriminatory
application
of
a
merit-based
pay
raise
decision,
system,
which
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
claim
that
we're
making
in
this
case.
but
this
court
nonetheless
held
that
continuing
to
pay
workers,
those
workers,
less
than
similarly
situated
whites
because
of
that
discrimination
that
occurred
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
was
still
a
present
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
show
that
that
de
novo
decision
was
intentionally
discriminatory.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
think
that
he...
he
couldn't
have
thought
that
because
the
facts
are
absolutely
clear
and
goodyear
acknowledges
in
this
court
that
the
pay
system
that
they
had
in
place
simply
made
an
annual
decision
whether
to
make
a
marginal
increase
into
the
raise
and
took
the
prior
salary
as
given.
if
i
could,
before
i
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
make
the
point
that
to
the
extent
the
court
doesn't
think
bazemore
decides
this
case,
and
doesn't
think
that
the
statute
is
clear
on
this
question,
it
should
defer
to
the
expert
opinion
of
the
eeoc
on
this
question
in
which
they
have
particular
expertise
because
they
see
thousands
of
these
claims
every
year.
they
know
better
than
anybody
else
whether
the
paycheck
accrual
rule
is
unworkable
in
practice,
or
that
the
pay
decision
accrual
rule
will
lead
to
the
elimination
of
many
claims
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
preserve.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
there
are...
there
is
an
additional
layer
of
defense,
but
still
the
employee
has
to
prove
an
additional
element
in
a
title
vii
claim,
not
just
the
absence
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work,
it
has
to--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
the
fundamental
disagreement
in
this
case
comes
down
to
what
is
the
unlawful
employment
practice
congress
was
referring
to
when
it
prohibited
discrimination
with
respect
to
compensation.
if
it
is
under
our
view,
in
our
view,
the
payment
of
an
intentionally
disparate
wage,
then
there's
no
question
that
under
bazemore
the
violation
occurred
during
the
limitations
period.
the
fact
that
the
intent
was
formed
outside
the
limitations
period
doesn't
make
the
present
payment
of
a
disparate
wage
because
of
sex
any
less
intentionally
discriminatory.
but
the
difference
in
the
conceptions,
which
frankly
isn't
answered
by
the
plain
text
of
this
statute
itself,
should
be
resolved
in
light
of
the
practical
consequences
of
the
differences
in
the
rules.
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
that
a
paycheck
accrual
rule
applies
at
least
in
a
case
of
a
policy
of
discrimination,
but
that's
a
very
difficult
rule
to
administer
for
the
eeoc,
which
must
make
a
determination
of
timeliness
before
it
even
has
authority
to
investigate
a
claim.
it
shouldn't
be
left
to
the
eeoc
to
figure
out
whether
there's
an
unwritten
practice
or
an
unwritten
policy
which
would
require
an
extensive
investigation
not
only
of
the
petitioner's
pay
but
of
everybody
else's.
you
recall
that
in
bazemore
they
had
to
conduct
a
multiple
regression
analysis
to
establish
a
pattern
of
discrimination
there.
our
rule
is
simple
to
administer
and
has
been
administered
for
decades
in
the
lower
courts
and
it's
the
rule
that
the
eeoc
itself
has
chosen
in
construing
this
ambiguous
aspect
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
that's
incorrect.
i
mean,
the
eeoc
has
taken
this
position
that
you
can
challenge
present
pay
disparities
even
before
the
court's
decision
in
bazemore
and
it
continued
to
adhere
to
it
afterward.
the
fact
that
they
cited
to
bazemore
shouldn't
disentitle
them
to
the
kind
of
deference
that
they're
ordinarily
entitled
to
when
they
construe
a
statute
that's
given
to
them,
and
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
question
congress
would
have
entitled
them
to
exercise
their
expertise
on.
finally,
i
would
like
to
raise
the
point
that
under
respondent's
rule
the
extension
service
would
have
been
permitted
to
pay
blacks
less
than
white
in
perpetuity
in
bazemore
so
long
as
it
did
so
because
of
cost
and
not
because
it
wanted
to
continue
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
similarly,
under
the
solicitor
general's
view
an
employer
who
had
intentionally
discriminated
through
discrete
decisions
against
some
of
its
employees
prior
to
the
act
would
be
allowed
to
continue
to
do
so
after
the
act
because
the
decision
would
have
been
the
potentially
unlawful
act
in
that
case
and
that
wouldn't
have
been
actionable.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
congress
intended
nothing
than
a
complete--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
could...
the
extension
service--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
would
be
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
they
would...
they
would
say
that,
the
reason
we
didn't
immediately
equalize
salaries
is
because
it
cost
too
much,
it
would
have
required...
we'd
be
required
to
cut
down
on
our
programs.
and
under
respondent's
view
that
is
not
intentionally
pay-maintaining
discrimination.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
they
would
say,
we
don't
want
to
equalize
pay
because
it
costs
too
much,
and
that's
not
a
discriminatory
reason
for
maintaining
the
prior
disparity.
but
ultimately--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--which
is
what
happened
here.
goodyear
continued
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex,
knowing
as
a
matter
of
agency
law
that
it
had
done,
it
had
set
her
pay
for
discriminatory
reasons
in
the
past.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
would,
but
if
they
chose
not
to
equalize
at
all
because
they
don't
want
to
spend
the
money
the
money
that
would
be
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
thank
you.
