justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
they
know
that?
10
years
ago
the
employee
got
a
particular,
got
a
particular
job
evaluation
and
that
dictated
the
amount
of
pay
that
that
employee
was
going
to
get
for
that
period
and
all,
all
subsequent
pay
built
on
that
base,
and
then
it
turns
out
many
years
later
that
there
was
discrimination
in
the
way
the
employee
was
evaluated
way
back
when,
even
though
there
was
no
complaint
about
it;
then
under
your
theory
that
would
be
a
present
title
vii
violation,
to
cut
a
paycheck
that
built,
that
was
based
on
pay
that
was
built
on
this
act
of
discrimination
that
occurred
long
ago?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
yeah,
but
that
assumed
a
present
discrimination,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
that
we've
got
is
the
problem
of
connecting
a
past
discrimination
with
what
may
in
fact
be
an
apparently
neutral
act
15
or
20
years
later.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
your
burden
to
prove?
you've
talked
about
their
burden
to
go
back
when...
do
i
understand
it
that
your
view
is
that
the
only
thing
you
have
to
prove
is
that
in
this
case
a
woman
was
being
paid
at
a
rate
which
is
different
from
the
rate
of
a
man
doing
a
comparable
job?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
of
the
explanation
that
was
given
in
bazemore?
i
forget
the
subsequent
case.
it
was
in
footnote
6.
you
know
what
i
mean.
which
referred
to
bazemore
as
a
case
that
involved
a
present
discrimination
which,
which
is
inconsistent
with
your
theory.
what
do
you
say
about
footnote
6?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
policy...
i
thought
the
assumption
was
that
the
policy
was
in
fact
a
policy
which,
which
was
sort
of
currently
honored
and
intended
to
be
honored
by
the
company,
whereas
the
case
that
we're
concerned
about
is
the
case
in
which
there
was
a
discriminatory
act,
you
know,
5,
10,
15
years
ago.
nobody
remembers
the
discrimination
now.
it's
just
that
it
continues
to
have
these
ripple
effect
consequences.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
subsequent
explanation
in
bazemore
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
your
position
with
respect
to
the
current
ripple
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
take...
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
the
case.
you
know
the
case
that
i'm
talking
about
with
the
footnote?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess.
do
you
think
that
the
court
in
the
footnote
misstated
bazemore
and
that
therefore
we
should
trust
to
bazemore
and
not
the
subsequent
explanation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
assumes
that
the
company
in
effect
says,
we
have
a
pay
structure
and
our
pay
structure
as
it
is
now
treats
people
differently
depending
on
sex,
race,
or
whatever.
and
that's
not
the
kind...
that's
something
very
different
from
the
ripple
effect
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
so
even
if
they
know
it
was
in
fact
originally
an
unlawful
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
draw
a
line
between
present
purposeful
discrimination
and
present
knowledge
of
past
discrimination
which
is
knowingly
carried
forward.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
eeoc
is
upheld
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
review
is
sought
here,
will
the
government
confess
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
eeoc
decision
is
upheld
by
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
there
is
an
attempt
to
bring
the
case
here
on
cert,
will
the
government
confess
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
asking
a
simpler
question.
let's
assume
that
somehow
we
fudge
it.
if...
if
there
is
a
clear
cut
case
in
which
the
eeoc
takes
a
position
different
from
the
one
the
government
is
now
espousing,
and
a
court
of
appeals
upholds
it,
and
cert
is
sought
here,
will
the
solicitor
general
say
please
remand,
or
simply
confess
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
i
got
your
point.
