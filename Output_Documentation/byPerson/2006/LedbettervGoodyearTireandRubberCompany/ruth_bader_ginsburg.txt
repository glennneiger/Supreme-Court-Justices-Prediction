justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
russell,
i
thought
that
your
argument
was
that
yes,
you
know
that
you
haven't
got
the
promotion,
you
know
you
haven't
got
the
transfer,
but
the
spread
in
the
pay
is
an
incremental
thing.
you
may
think
the
first
year
you
didn't
get
a
raise,
"well,
so
be
it".
but
you
have,
you
have
no
reason
to
think
that
there
is
going
to
be
this
inequality.
i
mean
she
started
out
getting
the
same
pay,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
to
the
equal
pay
act
claim?
you
started
out
with
a
title
vii
claim
and
an
equal
pay
claim
and
somewhere
along
the
way
the
equal
pay
claim
dropped
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
you
ask
for
the
equal
pay
claim?
as
i
understand
the
magistrate
judge
he
said,
yes,
you
had
made
it
across
the
first
hurdle,
you
had
a
prima
facie
case.
you
showed
that
you're
a
woman,
and
you're
getting
this
and
all
the
men
are
getting
much
higher.
but
the
employer
has
come
forward
with
any
other
factor
other
than
sex
and
the
other
factor
is
that,
your
inadequate
performance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
in
the
title
vii
case
assuming
you're
right,
that
you
get
across
the
same
threshold,
you're
faced
with
the
same
defense.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
have
the
same
defenses
because
the
bennett
amendment
makes
the
defenses
under
the
equal
pay
act
applicable
under
title
vii,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
your
answer
before
was
that
this
is
not...
if
she's
going
to
bring
a
case
i
got
a
2
percent
raise,
he
got
a
3
percent
raise,
her
chances
are
very
slim,
but
if
this
builds
up
year
by
year
to
the
point
where
see
is
saying,
i'm
being
denied
equal
pay,
it's
a
requirement
of
the
anti-discrimination
law
that
i
get
equal
pay,
so
today
i'm
not
getting
equal
pay,
i
thought...
i
mean,
the
chance
that
she
could
win
when
she
gets
a
salary
review
and
she
gets
a
little
less
than
the
other
person
are
nil.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
as
i
remember
the
facts
of
this
case,
wasn't
it
in
1995
that
she
got
a
substantial
raise
and
the
reason,
according
to
her
supervisor,
was
that
he
noticed
that
her
pay
was
below
the
minimum
of
the
appropriate
range
for
her
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
different
if
the
one
further
statement
was
made.
and
the
employer
knew
that
every
woman
is
being
paid
less
than
every
man.
why
isn't
that
sufficient
under
title
vii,
and
if
you
want
evidence,
your
own
supervisor
said,
oh,
we
saw
one
year
that
she
was
outside
the
range
appropriate
for
this
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
evans
involved
a
factor
that
simply
is
not
present
here.
i
mean,
evans
involved
a
seniority
system.
and
if
this
person
who
had
been
off
the
job
were
to
come
back
two
years
later,
and
bump
people
who
had
been
there
every
day,
well,
certainly
that's
a
different
case
than
this
one,
where
she
is
saying,
i
should
have
been
paid
equally.
i
wasn't.
and
i
know
i
can
go
back
only
two
years.
that's
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
evans
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
only
the
180
day
period
counts,
and
she
can
complain
only
about
discrimination
in
that
period,
then
how
do
you
account
for
her
being
able
to
go
back
not
180
days,
but
two
years
for
her
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
the
lid
on
the
amount
of
compensation
you
could
get
in
title
vii
cases.
you
can't
go
back
more
than
two
years
for
damages.
but
it
would
seem
that
doesn't
fit
at
all
whether
you
can
go
back
only
180
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
she
claiming
that
in
1995,
a
supervisor
recognized
that
my
pay
was
way
out
of
line.
isn't
that
what
the
supervisor
testified?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
she
thought
that,
well,
they
are
on
the
right
track.
next
year,
they
are
going
to
raise
me
up
to
the
equal
pay
level.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
nager
that
i
think
is
really
important,
and
that
is,
where
do
you
put
these
pay
cases?
do
you
put
it
in
the
box
with
the
hostile
environment
that
builds
up
over
time,
and
as
long
as
the
environment
is
hostile
at
the
time
you
bring
your
complaint,
then
it
doesn't
matter
that
it
started
20
years
ago.
this
notion
of
one
year,
it's
2
percent,
and
the
other
person
got
3
percent,
you
really
don't
have
an
effective
claim
unless
it
builds
up
to
the
point
where
there
is
a
noticeable
disparity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
morgan
decision
quotes
bazemore
for
saying,
under
title
vii,
each
week's
paycheck
that
delivered
less
to
a
black
than
to
a
similarly
situated
white
is
a
wrong,
actionable
under
title
vii.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
portion
it's
in,
it
says
each
week's
paycheck
that
delivered
less
to
a
black
than
to
a
similarly
situated
white
is
a
wrong,
actionable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
you
describe
dealing
with
a
case
like
manhart
where
they
were
complaining
about
a
pension
plan
that
had
been
instituted,
oh,
way
longer
than
180
days,
years
and
years
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
would
be
a
good
equal
pay
act
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
doesn't
it
become
intentional,
at
least
after
1995,
when
the
supervisor
recognizes
that
he's
got
an
employee
that
is
out
of
the
appropriate
range
for
her
job,
whether
she
does
it
badly
or
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
she
bring
it
then?
they
gave
her
a
big
raise
that
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
she
have
every
reason
to
expect,
well,
they
finally
noticed
it,
so
next
year
i'm
going
to
get
that
same
size
raise,
but
that
it
doesn't
happen
the
next
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
is
not
talking
about
a
decision
made
15
or
14
in
this
case.
she
starts
out
even,
and
it
builds
up
over
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
talking
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's
a
defense.
and
you're
talking
about,
yes,
you
might
draw
that
inference
but
that
inference
would
be
wrong
because
i
have
a
defense.
the
defense
is
poor
performance
explains
it,
not
sex
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
at
least
in
this
area,
the
defenses
were
the
same
as
under
the
equal
pay
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
don't
we
at
least
hear
from
the
eeoc?
that
has
happened
in
other
cases
where
the
department
of
justice
and
the
eeoc
take
different
positions,
at
least
the
eeoc
filed
a
brief
even
though
it
wasn't
the
government's
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
under
the
equal
pay
act.
you
can
only
equalize
up,
not
down.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
justice
alito
announced
four
members
of
this
court,
justices
stevens,
souter,
breyer
and
i
dissent
from
today’s
decision.
in
our
view,
the
court
does
not
comprehend
or
is
indifferent
to
the
insidious
way
in
which
women
can
be
victims
of
pay
discriminations.
today’s
decision
counsels
sue
early
on
when
it
is
uncertain
whether
discrimination
accounts
for
the
pay
disparity
you
are
beginning
to
experience.
indeed,
initially
you
may
not
know
that
men
are
receiving
more
for
substantially
similar
work.
of
course,
you
are
likely
to
lose
less-than-fully
baked
case.
if
you
sue
only
when
the
pay
disparity
becomes
steady
and
large
enough
to
enable
you
to
amount
a
winnable
case,
you
will
be
cutoff
at
the
court’s
threshold
for
suing
too
late
and
that
situation
cannot
be
what
congress
intended
when
title
vii
it
outlawed
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin
in
our
nation’s
workplaces.
lilly
ledbetter,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
engaged
as
an
area
manager
at
a
goodyear
tire
and
rubber
plant
in
alabama
in
1979.
her
starting
salary
was
inline
with
the
salary
of
men
performing
similar
work
but
overtime
her
pay
slipped
in
comparison
to
the
pay
of
male
employees
with
equal
or
less
seniority.
by
the
end
of
1997,
ledbetter
was
the
only
woman
left
working
as
an
area
manager
and
the
pay
discrepancy
between
ledbetter
and
her
15
male
counterparts
was
stark.
ledbetter’s
pay
was
15%
to
40%
less
than
every
other
area
manager.
ledbetter
complained
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
march
1998,
she
charged
that
in
violations
of
title
vii,
goodyear
paid
her
a
discriminatorily
low
salary
because
of
her
sex.
the
charge
was
eventually
were
to
court
and
tried
to
a
jury.
the
jury
found
it
more
likely
than
not
that
goodyear
paid
ledbetter
an
unequal
salary
because
of
her
sex.
the
court
today
nullifies
that
verdict
holding
that
ledbetter’s
claim
is
time
barred.
title
vii
provides
that
a
charge
of
discrimination
shall
be
filed
within
180
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.
ledbetter
charged
and
proved
at
trial
that
the
pay
checks
she
received
within
the
180
day
filing
period
were
substantially
lower
than
the
pay
checks
received
by
men
doing
the
same
work.
further,
she
introduced
substantial
evidence
showing
that
discrimination
accounted
for
the
pay
differential
indeed
that
discrimination
against
women
as
supervisors
was
pervasive
at
goodyear’s
plant.
that
evidence
was
unavailing,
the
court
holds
because
it
was
incumbent
on
ledbetter
to
file
charges
of
discrimination
year
by
year.
each
time
goodyear
failed
to
increase
her
salary,
commensurate
with
the
salaries
of
her
male
peers.
any
annual
pay
decision
not
contested
properly
within
the
180
days.
the
court
affirm,
becomes
grandfathered
beyond
the
province
of
title
vii
ever
to
repair.
title
vii
was
meant
to
govern
real
world
employment
practices
and
that
world
is
what
the
court
ignores
today.
pay
disparities
often
occur
as
they
did
in
ledbetter’s
case
in
small
increments
only
overtime
is
their
strong
cause
to
suspect
that
discrimination
is
at
work.

moral
initial
discrepancies,
even
if
the
employee
knows
they
exist
may
not
be
seen
as
ground
for
a
federal
case.
an
employee
like
ledbetter
trying
to
succeed
in
a
male
dominated
workplace
in
a
job
filled
only
by
men
before
she
was
hired,
understandably
maybe

to
avoid
making
leaves.

from

and
easy
to
identify
at

events
in
that
category
include
firing,
denial
of
a
promotion
or
refusal
to
hire.
in
contrast
to
those
unambiguous
actions
until
a
pay
disparity
becomes
apparent
and
sizeable,
an
employee
is
unlikely
to
comprehend
her
plight
and
therefore
to
complain
about
it.
ledbetter’s
initial
readiness
to
give
her
employer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,

her
from
later
seeking
redress

of
her

as
the
court
reads
title
vii,
each
and
every
pay
decision
ledbetter
did
not
properly
challenge,
wiped
the
slate
clean.
never
mind
the
cumulative
effect
of
a
series
of
decisions
that
together,
set
her
pay
well
below
that
of
every
male
area
manager.

carrying
past
pay

must
be
treated
as

ledbetter
may
not
be
compensated
under
title
vii
for
the
lower
pay
she
was
in
fact
receiving
when
she
complained
to
the
eeoc.
notably,
the
same
denial
of
release
would
occur
at
ledbetter
encountered
pay
discrimination
based
on
race,
religion,
age,
national
origin
or
disability.
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
court
has
ordered
a
cramped
interpretation
of
title
vii,
incompatible
with
the
statutes

purpose.
in
1991,
congress
passed
a
civil
rights
act
that
effectively
overruled
several
of
this
courts
similarly
restrictive
decisions
including
one
on
which
the
court
relies
today.
today,
the
ball
again
lies
in
congress’
court
as
in
1991
the
legislature
has
caused
to
note
and
to
correct
this
court’s
parsimonious
reading
of
title
vii.
