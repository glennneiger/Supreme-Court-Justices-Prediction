but
are
you
saying
that
the
rule
for
paycheck
decisions
is
different
than
the
rule
for
other
sorts
of
decisions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
to
work
the
other
way
around,
just
like
the
case
we've
just
heard
argued
in
the
last
hour.
it's
a
question
of
specificity
here.
if
the,
if
the
employee,
he
alleges
that
promotions
were
based
on
experience
and
the
employee
didn't
have
the
experience
because
of
past
discrimination,
why
is
that
different
than
the
paycheck
rule?
i
take
it
indicates
that
you
would
not
allow
the,
a
cause
of
action
unless
the
discrimination
was
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
true
if
there
were
a
change
in
ownership
of
the
company,
so
the
discrimination
originally
occurred
under
owner
a,
then
the
company
is
purchased
by
owner
b,
completely
unrelated,
and
the,
the
disparity
is
used
for
bonuses,
etcetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the,
under
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice
and
the
rule
you
propose,
what
of
the
case
of
differing
ownership?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
he
have
to
know
that
the
present
decision
to
continue
the
pay
structure
is
discriminatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
discriminatory
act
and
if
the
employer,
let's
say
it's
an
employer
that
has
just
purchased
a
business,
thinks
that
it's
a
neutral
criterion
to
base
wages
or
bonuses
or
increase
on
a
prior
pay
scale
and
he
doesn't
know
about
the
prior
discrimination,
why
isn't
that
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
he
has
no
intent
to
discriminate
as
a
present
matter,
but
he
also
knows
that
his
decision
is
necessarily
based
on
a
policy
that
was
discriminatory
some
years
ago.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
knows
it,
but
his
present
decision
is
necessarily
based
on
some
prior
decision
that
was
discriminatory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that...
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
statement
in
bazemore
that
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
eradicate
past
discrimination?
