chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
ledbetter
versus
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
15
years
earlier
a
discriminatory
decision
was
made
to
give
a
pay
raise
of
4
percent
rather
than
5
percent,
and
that
over
the
15
years
became
the
basis
with
other
raises,
you
think
you
can
challenge
the
discrimination
15
years
later
and
say
well,
this
was
discriminatory
because
15
years
ago
i
didn't
get
a
raise
and
that,
carried
forward,
had
a
ripple
effect
into
the
current
180-day
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
congress
could
have
specifically
provided
for
the
equal
pay
act
rule
under
title
vii,
but
it
didn't
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
all
they'd
have
to
do
is
allege
that
sometime
over
the
past...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
15
years.
it
could
be
40
years,
right...
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
act,
in
one
of
the
semi-annual
pay
reviews
i
was
denied
this,
a
raise
that
i
should
have
gotten.
it
may
have
been
20
years
ago.
it
may
have
been
40
years
ago.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
if
they
just
discovered
it?
i
just
learned
about
what
happened
30
years
ago
at
this
company
and
it's...
i
filed
right
away.
there's
no
laches.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
they
have
to
go
back
and
litigate
what
happened
30
years
ago.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
your
theory.
i
mean,
if
it
happened
once
20
years
ago
you
have
a
case
that
you
can
bring,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
got
a
memo
that
says
we're
going
to
pay,
20
years
ago,
we're
going
to
pay
males
this
much
and
we're
going
to
pay
females
this
much,
and
she
says
that
obviously
affected
my
pay
over
the
ensuing
15,
20
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it's
not
enough
presumably
for
somebody
to
come
in
and
even
up
everybody?
i
mean,
if
you
see
that
the
women
are
making
20
percent
less
than
the
men
you
don't
escape
liability
by
paying
everybody
the
same
going
forward,
because
perhaps
if
nondiscriminatory
decisions
had
been
made
the
women
would
have
making
20
percent
more
than
the
men.
you
have
to
go
back
and
revisit
every
pay
decision
or
you're
exposed
to
liability
for
current
pay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
true?
i
mean,
it
depends.
i
suppose
it
may
be
harder
for
the
company
to
mount
a
defense
over
time,
so
it
may
be
to
her
advantage
to
wait.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
lorance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
mr.
nager,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
mr.
gornstein?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
it's
the
same
person
who
made
the
decision.
you
know,
five
years
ago
he
said
i'm
giving
a
6
percent
raise
to
men,
i'm
giving
a
3
percent
raise
to
women,
and
then
he
decides
that's
illegal,
and
so
from
now
on
everybody
is
going
to
get
a
4
percent
raise
every
year
if
you
meet
certain
standards.
is
that
ongoing
discrimination
or
is
that
a
neutral
thing,
that
he
doesn't
have
to
take
into
account
the
past
discrimination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
he
knows
that
it
carries
forward
the
illegal
discrimination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
russell,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
equalize
pay
by
lowering
others.
you
don't...
raising
the
discriminated-against
class
is
not
the
only
way
to
equalize
pay.
so
i
don't
see
how
cost
is
a
justification
for
continuing
the
disparity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
title
vii
you
can
equalize
either
way,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
05-1074;
ledbetter
v
goodyear
tire
and
rubber
company.
