suppose
you
go
back
to
the
15
year
old
action
which
led
to
disparity
that
continues
up
to
today,
and
suppose
at
the
beginning
or
in
july
of
2006
the
woman
discovers
it
and
brings
her
claim
and
suppose
she
wins.
now,
is
it
the
case...
and
here
i'm
uncertain.
i
thought
there
was
some
rule
in
respect
to
getting
damages
that
you
could
only
go
back
2
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
that
case
would
it
mean
that
in
this
case
where
it
happened
15
years
ago
and
she
won,
but
she
didn't
bring
her
act
until
august
of
2006,
that
she
could
only
then
collect
the
extra
money
for
the
preceding
2
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
isn't
going
to
open
up
tremendous
liability
for
15
or
20
years
ago.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
brennan's
opinion
sounds
to
me,
part
one,
as
if
he
is
saying
what
the
mistake
was
that
the
company
made
here
is
that
they
didn't
really
eradicate
the
effects
of
the
past
bad
act,
and
they
were
trying
to
eradicate
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
another
part
of
the
case
that's
part
two
and
part
three
about
the
evidence
that
came
in.
in
fact,
there
are
about
six
other
parts.
i'm
just
talking
about
part
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
all
right.
so
i
read
that.
now,
this
is
my
this
is
my
cost/benefit
analysis
here.
if
we
follow
the
other
side's
rule,
it's
very
simple,
we
just
said
bazemore
applies,
whether
there's
a
practice
or
whether
it
was
a
discrete
thing,
or
whatever,
so
it's
simple.
but
we
do
have
to
distinguish
pay
from
the
other
kinds
of
things.
and
we
have
heard
them
explain
why
there
is
a
distinction.
i'd
rather
get
to
your
side
and
then
you
can
attack
both,
or
whatever.
your
side
of
it,
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
agree
to
you,
i
now
have
to
create
in
the
law
some
kind
of
thing
that
sounds
very
complicated
about
whether
that
old
bad
thing
was
somehow
a
pattern
or
a
practice
that,
as
a
pattern
or
a
practice,
didn't
get
eradicated
within
the
last
few
years,
or
was
a
totally
discrete
act,
and
therefore,
had
no
implication
as
a
pattern
or
practice
that
didn't
get
eradicated.
that
sounds
hard.
and
the
second
thing
i
guess
i'd
have
to
do
is
to
create
a
lot
of
tolling
law
because
there
will
be
probably
a
significant
number
of
circumstances
where
a
woman
is
being
paid
less,
and
all
she
does
is
for
the
last
six
months
get
her
paychecks
and
she
doesn't
really
know
it
because
pay
is
a
complicated
thing,
and
through
no
fault
of
her
own,
it
takes
about
eight
or
nine
months
or
even
a
year
for
her
to
find
out.
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
toll,
aren't
we?
so
i
have,
legally
speaking,
a
complicated
tolling
system
that
i
have
to
graft
on
to
this,
your
case.
i
also
have
to
start
distinguishing
bazemore
which
is
pretty
hard
to
do.
but
on
the
other
side,
they
are
just
saying,
go
with
the
flow.
nobody
is
really
hurt,
because
the
employer
has
to
worry
about
all
this
stuff
anyway
under
the
equal
pay
act.
i'm
giving
you
that
summary
so
you
can
just
shoot
it
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
do
on
the
other
side
of
this?
it
if
you
win
on
this,
then
don't
you
have
to
have
a
fairly
relaxed
standard
of
allowing
the
woman,
tolling
or
something,
when
she
just
gets
some
paychecks
that
would
take
her
a
while
to
figure
out
that
these
are
really
reflecting
some
old
discrimination
and
she
doesn't
know.
it's
different
in
that
respect
from
the
promotion
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
she
knows
this.
she
knows
that,
all
these
boxes
on
her
paychecks
and
she's
not
quite
sure
what
they
mean.
all
right,
your
answer
is
not
much
different.
