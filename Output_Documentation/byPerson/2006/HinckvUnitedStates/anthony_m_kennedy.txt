anthony

kennedy
is
that
the
one
that
says
interest
abated
with
respect
to
erroneous
refund
check?
or
am
i
reading
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say
that
congress
acted
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
no
right
to
the
abatement
with,
and
to
the
payment
unless
it
enacted
the
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if,
if
the
history
of
this
issue
had
been
such
that
before
the
enactment
of
this
section
the
courts
of
appeals
were
divided
or
the
courts
were
divided
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
and
in
the
district
court,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's,
so
it's
only
(h)
that
gives
any
court
any
jurisdiction
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
in
our
hypothetical
world
some
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
thought
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
an
abuse...
isn't
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
secretary
to
fail
to
do
what
the
statute
tells
him
he
absolutely
must?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
poor
do
not
have
the--
incentive
or
even
the
ability
to
defer
paying
a
tax,
where
the
people
that
have
large
bank
accounts
may,
and
investments,
may
well
profit
by
just
paying
the
interest
to
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
exactly
alike
but
for
their
ability
to
earn
interest
in
different
ways.
