mr.
thomas
e.
redding
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
is
simply
wrong.
enactment
of
section
6404(h)
did
not
repeal
district
court
and
court
of
federal
claims
refund
jurisdiction
over
interest
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
both
circuits
have
found
that
there
was
pre-existing
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
6406(h).
nothing
in
section
6404(h)
expressly
repeals
that
jurisdiction,
and
there
are
many
instances
in
the
code
where
congress
when
it
does
intend
to
expressly
limit
jurisdiction,
will
state
that
in
the
enabling
statute.
reference
to
the
tax
court,
specific
reference
to
the
tax
court
in
6404(h)
was
mandated
unnecessary
by
section
7442
and
the
nature
of
the
tax
court.
the
tax
court
is
only
given
jurisdiction
over
those
matters
where
it
is
specifically
set
out
in
the
tax
code.
and
the
established
framework
of
pay
and
sue
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts
and
prepayment
jurisdiction
in
the
tax
court
is
a
well
established
framework
for
tax
litigation.
that
has
been
accepted
and
enunciated
by
this
court
as
far
back
as
the
flora
opinions.
it's
a
well
established
pattern
of
duality
of
jurisdiction
in
the
two
forums.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
not
with
respect
to
abatement
of
interest,
your
honor,
but
as
a
general
basis.
the
availability
of
a
prepayment
forum
that
was
originally
enacted
to
be
complementary
to
the
ability
to
pay
and
sue
in
order
to
protect
smaller
taxpayers,
and
avoid
the
hardships
faced
by
having
to
pay
in
full
before
having
access
to
refund
jurisdiction,
and
in
fact
perhaps
to
avoid
bankruptcy.
that
is
completely
consistent
with
the
way
this
section
is
enacted.
section
6404(h)
even
includes
the
limitation
that
only
taxpayers
with
a
net
worth
below
$2
million
or
corporations
below
$7
million
have
prepayment
access
to
the
tax
court.
and
abatement
by
itself
is
generally
a
prepayment
remedy.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
do
believe
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
formation
of
the
tax
court
to
provide
a
prepayment
forum
to
especially
avoid
hardship
and
the
potential
even
of
bankruptcy.
it's
very
consistent
with
that
pattern
to
say
that
the
larger
taxpayer
can
afford
to
pay
the
tax
and
sue,
whereas
the
smaller
taxpayer
may
be
in
greater
need
of
a
prepayment
forum.
it's
also
consistent
with
imposing
the
very
short
limitation
period
for
bringing
an
action
in
the
tax
court,
because
there
the
government
has
a
very
vested
interest
in
being
able
to
proceed
with
collection
of
the
tax.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
to
congress's
reasoning
behind
that
but
i
can
understand
the
logic
behind
saying
we're
going
to
create
a
special
prepayment
remedy
that
allows
the
smaller
taxpayer
an
expedited
means
of
resolving
these
issues
without
having
to
first
pay
it
and
sue,
whereas
the
larger
taxpayer
is
not
put
into
a
hardship
position,
is
not
inconvenienced
as
bad
by
having
to
follow
the
old
well
established
procedures
of
pay
and
sue.
and
i
will
note
that
6404(h)
does
not
apply
only
to
6404(e)(1),
which
is
the
subsection
we're
coming
under.
6404(h)
applies
to
all
of
the
abatement
grounds
under
section
6404.
and
if
we
were
to
repeal
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
federal
claims
over
all
of
those
provisions,
then
we
would
be
completely
taking
away
a
remedy
that
has
been
there
all
along
to
the
larger
taxpayers.
but
to
create
a
new
remedy
that
is
consistent
with
the
pattern
that
allows
a
small
taxpayer
access
to
a
prepayment
forum,
i
think
is
completely
consistent
with
the
entire
history
of
this
court.
this
court
meaning
the
tax
court.
and
its
purpose.
in
evaluating
two
statutes
that
appear
to
either
conflict
or
overlap,
i
think
it
is,
in
reviewing
whatever
doctrine
you
call
it,
whatever
canon
you
call
it
of
interpretation,
it
appears
to
me
that
what
this
court
has
always
done
is
to
look
to
see
if
the
two
statutes
can
be
harmonized
rather
than
seeing
if
one
supersedes
the
other.
and
here
considering
the
extension
of
prepayment
jurisdiction
to
the
tax
court
merely
an
additional
form
of
prepayment
jurisdiction
being
granted
to
the
tax
court
is
completely
consistent
with
the
long-standing
pattern
of
pay
and
sue
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts,
prepayment
jurisdiction
in
the
tax
court--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--abatement
as
a
prepayment
remedy,
yes,
your
honor.
once
the
irs
has
failed
to
abate
the
interest
and
you
make
payment
then
you
have
the
normal
refund,
refund
provisions
available.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
actually
your
honor
i
don't
believe
that's
what
the
cases
said.
they
said
you
had
no
cause
of
action
that
could
be
pursued
under
6404(e)(1)
but
even
the
seminal
cases,
horton...
or
selman
and
horton
homes
compared
a
section
6404(e)(1)
action
to
a
section
6404(e)(2)
action
and
basically
said
you
could
have
brought
a
refund
claim.
if
you
qualified
under
(e)(2)
there
would
have
been
no
impediment
to
bringing
that
as
a
refund
action
because
there
was
a
clearly
established
standard.
the
(e)(2)
provision
is
a
must
standard.
now,
under
6404(h)
if
it
is
exclusive
over
abatement
jurisdiction,
then
any
taxpayer
who
would
have
had
access
to
the
courts,
for
example
for
an
(e)(2)
abatement
case,
unless
they
are
a
small
taxpayer
they
will
be
completely
denied
any
remedy
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
i
believe
all
of
6404
was
in
the
appendix
but
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
yeah.
it's...
it's
immediate,
in
the
code
section--
it's
immediately
below
(e)(1).
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
but
i
mean...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
doesn't
help
you--
[laughter]
--where
it
is
in
the
materials.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
i
apologize,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
have
that.
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
entire
code
section
is
set
out.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
well,
your
honor,
i
have
the
code
section
in
front
of
me
now
but
i
still
do
not
have
the
reference
in
the
appendix.
i
apologize
but
i
simply
don't
have
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--well
no,
your
honor,
everyone
cannot
go
there.
you
can
only
go
there
if
you're
a
taxpayer,
an
individual
taxpayer
with
a
net
worth
of
less
than
$2
million.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
your
honor,
again,
my,
my
view
of
that
is
the
congress
intended
to
limit
the
special
relief
of
prepayment
jurisdiction
to
the
smaller
taxpayers.
but
the
availability
of
a
pay
and
sue
remedy
was
already
in
existence
and
continues
in
existence
and
those
wealthier
taxpayers
generally
can
afford
to
pay
the
liability
in
full
and
sue.
a
prepayment
forum
which
delays
the
collection
of
the
tax
to
the
government,
you
know,
the
government
has
a
special
interest
there
in
restricting
access
to
that
relief
so
that
it
can
proceed
with
collection.
and
again,
it
just
makes
logical
sense
that
as
to
a
larger
taxpayer
the
ability
to
pay
and
sue
should
be
a
sufficient
remedy.
generally
speaking--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--your
honor,
that
comes
largely
from
the
legislative
history,
the
house
committee
report
addressing
interestingly,
subsection
(h).
and
subsection
(h)
since
it
applies
only
to
prepayment
abatement
claims
specifically,
i
think
then
you,
then
that
legislative
history
makes
sense.
because
in
that
same
page
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--i
don't
believe
there
is
a
specific
case
out
there
that
i
can
cite
to
you
where
it
has
happened.
it
is,
it
is
reflected
in
both
horton
homes
and
selman
that
that
availability
existed
with
respect
to
(e)(2)
to--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
again,
because
that
legislative
history
that's
referred
to
is
restricted,
the
house
committee
report
is
restricted
only
to
the
subsection
creating
the
tax
court
prepayment
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
rest
of
the
amendments
to
section
6404.
and
i
note
that
in
doing
so
congress
also
did
not
make
the
restriction
on
the
$2
million/$7
million
net
worth
relative
to
the
rights
being
granted
under
the
other
provisions
of
6404.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
well...
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
because
6404(h)
applies
to
(e)(2)
as
much
as
it
does
to
(e)(1).
and
any
taxpayer
that
would
have
met
the
net
worth
requirements
or
whether
or
not
they
met
the
net
worth
requirements
that
are
now
in
h,
could
have
brought
a
refund
suit
under
(e)(2)
previously.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
no
it
does
not,
your
honor.
what
i'm
trying
to
address
is
the
intent
to
repeal
the
pre-existing
jurisdiction,
again
because
6404(h)
does
not
apply
just
to
(e)(1),
where
the
might
be
a
question
about
whether
or
not
they
could
have
brought
the
case
previously,
although
jurisdiction
existed.
clearly
they
could
have
brought
their
case
under
(e)(2).
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
of
(e)(2)--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--that's
correct.
and
additionally
limit
it
solely
to
the
small
taxpayer.
the
larger
taxpayer
who
had
a
prior
remedy
would
have
none.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
creates
the
standard
under
which
the
tax
court
may
review
any
interest
abatement
claim
under
section--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
standard
it
applies
to.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
well
i
think
it's
the
standard
on
which
they
are
to
review
the
government's
action.
and
i
believe
i
cannot
cite
the
case
but
there
are
cases
that
hold
that
a
violation
of
law
is
a
per
se
abuse
of
discretion.
there
are
also
other
subsections...
subsections
under
6404
which
are
made
provisions
in
other
6404
subsections,
which
are
must
provisions.
there
are
about
five
different
subsections
under
6404
that
provide
for
interest
abatement.
again,
i
come
back
to
the
long-established
pattern
of
having
prepayment
jurisdiction
in
the
tax
court
and
postpayment
refund
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts
and
court
of
federal
claims.
it's
a
well
established
system,
and
adding
a
new
prepayment
form
of
relief
into
the
tax
court
in
no
way
should
be
implied
to
be
a
repeal
of
the
long
established
refund...
pay
and
sue
refund
jurisdiction
that
normally
exists.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
if
the
failure
to
abate
interest
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
under
(e)(1)
you
would
rely
on
(e)(1)
for
the
cause
of
action.
the
right
is
created
by
the
other
subsections
of
(h)
of
6404.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
what
they
actually
said
is
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
hear
it
but
there
was
not
a
justiciable
standard
that
could
be
applied
with
regard
to
(e)(1).
however,
once
congress
came
in
and
says
to
the
tax
court
you're
going
to
apply
this
standard,
there
is
a
standard
of
review.
that
now
indicates
congress
did
not
intend
it
to
be
solely
discretionary,
and
that
the
district
court
or
court
of
federal
claims
would
look
to
the
general
common
law;
it
would
look
to
precedents,
such
as
the
apaa
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
consistently
used
throughout
the
court
systems
in--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
a
common
law
standard
which
has
been
carried
over
into...
into
this
statute.
but
to
create
a--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--i
understand
and
that's
basically
the
fifth
circuit's
view,
your
honor.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
view.
i
think
that
the
congress
was
merely
expanding
the
existing
structure
of
prepayment
jurisdiction
for
the
tax
court--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--pardon?
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
it
did,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
the
federal
circuit
analyzed
it
as
you
have.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
correct
analysis.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
has
this
one
right.
what
you
have
is
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
united
states
tax
court
for
a
prepayment
forum
of
relief
which
is
consistent
with
the
existing
pattern,
and
in
no
other
instance
where
that
has
been
done
has
there
been
an
implied
repeal.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
i
understand
that
argument,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--i
agree,
your
honor.
i
would
note
to
the
court,
though,
that
6404(d)
is
also
a
may-abate
provision
which
is
in
the
code.
6404(a)
is
also
a
permissive
abatement
provision,
and
those
provisions
would
clearly
be
covered
by
it.
i,
when
it
says
it
may,
may
review
a
failure
to
abate
interest
under
6404,
i
read
that
as
encompassing
all
of
6404
and
creating
their
standard
for
review.
i
do
not
review
that
as
a
new
standard
that
applies.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
your
honor,
i've
been
able
to
find
no
case--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
yes,
your
honor.
there's
no
clearly
history
of
cases.
i
would
also
submit,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
established
pattern
of
pay
and
sue
versus
prepayment
jurisdiction
and
the
necessity
to
make
a
specific
reference
to
the
tax
court
in
any
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tax
code
in
order
to
enable
the
tax
court
to
have
jurisdiction,
that
if
this
is
the
ruling
of
this
court
with
regard
to
6404(h),
it
is
going
to
raise
a
question
every
time
prepayment
jurisdiction
is
extended
to
the
tax
court
over
any
matter
as
to
whether
that
somehow
now
becomes
exclusive
of
the
conventional
pay
and
sue
remedy.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
prepay.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
your
honor,
may
i
reflect
it
back
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
time
period
with
respect
to
which
abatement
is
requested
occurs
many
years
before
the
irs
ever
sent
the
taxpayer
a
bill.
the
errors
and
delays
complained
of
in
this
case
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
partnership
level
examination
and
proceedings.
the
taxpayer
at
that
time
doesn't
even
have
a
notice
of
what
the
adjustments
are
going
to
be,
let
alone
what
his
tax
liability
is.
in
a
partnership
case,
the
partnership
level
determinations
are
made
at
the
partnership
level.
the
government
then,
without
any
further
notice
to
the
taxpayer,
is
free
to
make
the
computation
of
the
taxpayer's
liability
and
send
him
a
bill.
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
at
the
partnership
level,
there
is
virtually
no
way
to
tell,
except
as
to
what
the
outside
maximum
liability
might
be
if
the
government
prevails,
what
your
liability
is
going
to
be.
and
if--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--absolutely,
your
honor,
that's
being
asked
to
be
relieved
of
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
well,
yes.
it's
accruing
during
the
course
of
the
tax
court
proceeding.
and
again,
even
there
for
an
individual
if
the
time
period
involved
was
prior
to
the
assessment
the
pay,
the
being
able
to
pay
it
and
cut
off
the
interest
really
wouldn't
make
sense.
basically,
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
i
believe
that
this
case
really
rests
on
what
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
summarized
quite
well
when
it
says
that
it
makes
more
sense
in
this
case
to
simply
believe
the
congress,
quote,
"simply
intended"...
"simply
chose
to
extend
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
tax
court
over
a
certain
class
of
claims.
"
and
that's
all
it
really
has
done
here.
it
has
implemented
and
expanded
the
conventional
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
as
a
prepayment
forum
before
you
do
have
to
pay
the
liability
to
resolve
a
dispute
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
there
is
no
reason,
i
don't
believe,
to
see
this
as
a
major
departure
from
the
existing
structure
of
pay
and
sue
jurisdiction
versus
prepayment
jurisdiction.
this
is
just
a
well
established
plan
that's
been
in
the
code
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions
i
would
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
if
i
may,
there
are
a
couple
of
brief
points
i
would
like
to
make.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
6404(h)
it
concludes
with
the
statement
that
no
inference
should
be
made
from
that
legislation
as
to
other
courts'
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
should
be
taken
very
seriously.
as
to
the
claims
court--
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
--that's
in
a
house
committee
report,
your
honor.
as
to
claim
splitting,
it
is
actually
a
horrendous
problem
when
you're
talking
especially
about
partnership-related
cases.
i
will
note
that
there
are
several
hundred
cases
below
waiting
the
outcome
of
this
case.
as
in
the
cramer
and
weiner
opinions
that
came
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
can
note
that
there
are
claims
for
interest
abatement,
abatement
not
under
6404,
but
that
interest
was
overcharged
by
applying
the
penalty
rate
of
interest.
there
is
a
refund
claim
for
the
penalty
portion
of
the
interest.
there
is
also
a
refund
claim
that
the
tax
was
assessed
outside
the
statute
of
limitations;
that's
clearly
a
refund
claim.
none
of
those
claims
would
be
encompassed
under
6404(h).
these
taxpayers
would
have
had
to
have
completely
split
their
claims,
asked
for
an
interest
abatement
in
the
tax
court
for
abuse
of
discretion
on
6404(e)(1).
mr.
thomas
e.
redding
that's
only
relatively
true
to
6404(e)(1),
your
honor.
but
i
will
note
that
under
6404(a),
where
cases
are
now
coming
out
of
the
tax
court
for
the
first
time,
because
it
now
has
jurisdiction
under
(h),
it
provides
authority
for
the
commissioner
to
abate
interest
where
the
irs
has
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
the
tax
liability
after
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
or
whether
it's
simply
an
erroneous
assessment.
those
claims
have
nothing
to
do
with
discretion,
and
they
are
not
really
just
ancillary
to
the
tax
liability;
they
arise
out
of
the
substantive
challenge
to
the
liability
itself.
the
woodrall
case
that
has
come
out,
which
is
the,
i
think
is
the
first
of
the
6404(a)
cases,
was
an
assertion
that
the
interest
had
been
charged
after
the
tax
had
been
paid.
now
that's
not
a
discretionary
abatement;
that's
an
illegal
assessment
of
interest
and
that's
a
6404(h)
claim
now.
previously
it
would
have
been
strictly
a
refund
claim
under
16...
under
1346.
i
would
also
note
that
in
terms
of
the
being
able
to
pay
it
to
cut
off
the
interest
accrual,
that
in
these
cases,
these
cases
that
are
before
the
court,
the
f
quality...
the
document
the
government
first
sent
out
proposing
adjustments
to
the
partnership
level,
if
you
had
computed
the
liability
based
on
what
the
government's
position
was,
the
ultimate
tax
liability
including
interest
to
any
point
in
time
would
have
been
at
least
three
times
the
amount
that
results
from
the
tax
court
decision.
it's
just
ludicrous
to
say
that
the
taxpayer
should
be
expected
to
take
whatever
the
government's
proposed
adjustments
are,
compute
what
his
maximum
liability
may
be,
and
pay
it
in
advance
or
post
a
bond
in
advance
in
order
to
cut
off
the
interest
accrual.
that
argument
just
doesn't...
in
my
mind
does
not
fly,
your
honor.
this,
this
court
in
bob
jones
university
did
address
the
pay
and
sue
versus
prepayment
jurisdiction
issue
in
terms
of
constitutionality
and
due
process.
and,
and
basically
said
that
as
long
as
there
is
a
pay
and
sue
remedy
available,
the
taxpayer
has
no
due
process
rights
to
a
prepayment
remedy,
but
that
the
court
might
have
come
down
differently
had
there
been
no
remedy
available
in
terms
of
pay
and
sue.
i
would
also
note
that
both
the
tax
court,
the
district
courts,
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
appellate
courts
have
long
reviewed
other
discretionary
acts
within
the
tax
code
by
the
commissioner
where
no
standard
is
set
forth
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
such
as
the
authorization
of
the
commissioner
to
abate
certain
penalties
where
the
taxpayer
has
sought
an
independent
appraisal
on
the
overvaluation
penalty
under
6659.
those
cases
have
been
reviewed
for
years
by
the
tax
court
and
by
the
district
courts
in
refund
cases
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
it
is
the
federal
common
law
standard
for
reviewing
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
determinations
in
horton
and
selman
holmes
are
unique
in
holding
that
it's
totally
discretionary.
thank
you,
your
honor.
