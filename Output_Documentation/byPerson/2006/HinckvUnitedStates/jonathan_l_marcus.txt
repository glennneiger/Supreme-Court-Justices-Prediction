mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
tax
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
actions
challenging
interest
abatement
determinations
under
section
6404(e)(1).
the
language,
structure
and
history
of
the
interest
abatement
review
statute
supports
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
to
principles
of
sovereign
immunity.
under
petitioner's
theory
the
specific
restrictions
on
the
remedy
that
congress
created
may
be
avoided
by
the
simple
expedient
of
filing
a
challenge
in
another
forum.
nothing
in
the
interest
abatement
review
statute
or
this
court's
precedent
permits
that
result.
the
place
to
start
is
the
language
of
the
interest
abatement
review
statute.
section
6404(h)
provides
the
tax
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
an
interest
abatement
action
brought
by
taxpayers
who
meet
the
net
worth
limitations
set
out
in
another
part
of
the
code
and
who
file
their
claim
within
180
days
of
the
secretary's
mailing
of
a
final
determination
not
to
abate
interest.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no,
our
position
would
be
the
same.
we
would
first
look
to
the
statutory
language
of
section
6404(e)(1)
and
that
provision
provides
that
the
secretary
may
abate
interest
when
there
is
an
error
or
delay
committed
by
an
irs
employee
in
the
performance
of
a
ministerial
act,
and
that
"may"
language
contrasts
with
other
provisions
that
have
mandatory
language
that
requires
the
secretary
to
abate.
in
addition,
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
up
until
1986
the
irs
didn't
even
have
ability
to
abate
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no,
it's
our
position
it
applies
only
to
discretionary
abatement
determinations
by
the
secretary.
the
language...
typically
when
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
imposed,
it
presupposes
that
the
decision
being
reviewed
involves
an
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes,
you
could
use
it,
although
it
typically
comes
up
when
the
government
has
filed
an
action
to
recover
an
erroneous
refund.
it's
usually
raised
as
a
defense.
but
you
could
bring
it
that
way.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
think
as
a
technical
matter,
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
natural
way
to
read
the
statute,
and
when
the
congress
imposed
that
abuse
of
discretion
standard
it
assumed
that
the
decisions
that
were
being...
that
were
subject
to
review
involved
the
exercise
of
a
discretion.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well
i
think
some
cases...
there
is
some
case
law
that
has
said
that
when
there
is
an
error
of
law
committed
by
a
lower
court
that
can
constitute
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
in
our
view
again
it's
not
the
natural
reading
of
the
standard
that
congress
put
in.
and
also,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
justice
kennedy,
you'll
see
that
congress
was
focused
on
the
absence
of
a
judicial
remedy
with
respect
to
determinations
by
the
secretary
that
involved
an
exercise
in
discretion.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
think
that's...
with
respect,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit's
reasoning
is
too
clever
by
half.
the
fifth
circuit
basically
extracted
one
piece
of
section
6404(h)'s
integrated
whole
and
held
that
there
now
is
a
refund
cause
of
action
that's
not
subject
to
the
specific
restrictions.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
when
congress
enacted
this
provision
and
think
about
what
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do.
if
congress
would
have
wanted
to
reverse
those
decisions
that
had
said
there's
no
cause,
no
refund
cause
of
action
for
interest
abatement,
they
could
have
easily
referenced
the
refund
statute
and
said
there
is
a
refund
action
available.
they
also
could
have
specified
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
or
the
district
courts
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
interest
abatement
issues.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
it's
anomalous.
i
think
if
you
consider
the
concept
of
interest
under
the
tax
code,
the
way
it
works
under
the
tax
code
is
interest
accrues
on
an
unpaid
tax
liability
from
the
time
the
tax
is
due
until
the
time
the
tax
is
paid.
so
the
amount
of
underpayment
is
the
amount
of
taxpayer
is
borrowing
from
the
government.
the
interest
that
accrues
on
that
underpayment
is
not
a
penalty;
it's
just
a
charge
basically
for
the
time
value
of
money.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right.
but
i
think,
i
think
the
idea
was
that
congress
was
concerned
that
some
taxpayers,
taxpayers
that
fall
within
the
net
worth
limitations,
might
be
in
positions
where
they
are
less
positioned
to
pay
the
full
tax
liability
up
front.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
way
this
is...
the
interest
that's
abatable
is,
a
taxpayer
is
in
full
control
of
whether
that
interest
runs
or
not.
if
the
taxpayer
pays
his
full
tax
liability
on
time,
interest
doesn't
accrue,
so
there's
no
interest
to
abate.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
the
taxpayer--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
the
taxpayer
is
in
the
best
position
to
know
what
the
tax
liability
is.
if
a
taxpayer
is
going
to
make
certain
investments,
they
should
understand
what
the
tax
consequences
are.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right.
but
he
could
have
prevented
that,
the
abatable
interest,
from
accruing.
this
abatable
interest
doesn't
accrue
until
the
taxpayer
receives
notice
from
the
irs
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
return.
so
the...
in
other
words,
that
first
period
from
the
time
the
underpayment
is
made
until
the
irs
notifies
the
taxpayer,
that,
that
interest
is
not
subject
to
abatement.
that
automatically
accrues
and
there
is
no
remedy.
congress
has
created
no
remedy
for
that
period,
and
there's
just
a
period,
there's
a
provision
in
section--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--until
you're
notified,
until
the
irs
notifies
you
that
they
are
looking
further
at
your
return.
they
might
not
at
that
point
tell
you
precisely
how
much
you
owe,
but
you're
on
notice
that
the
irs
is
looking
into
your
return
further
and
that
you
can
at
that
point
make
a
payment
or
put
down
a
deposit
that
doesn't
compromise
your
ability
as
a
taxpayer
to
go
into
the
tax
court,
but
it
does
stop
the
accrual
of
abatable
interest.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
again,
they
don't
necessarily
tell
you
exactly
how
much
you
owe,
but
it's
the
taxpayers'--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--they
sometimes
do.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
they
sometimes
do,
and
then
at
18
months,
at
18
months
under
subsection
(g),
under
18
months
under
a
provision
that
was
acted
in
1998,
the
irs
has
to
at
18
months
tell
you
how
much
you
owe;
otherwise,
the
interest
cannot
continue
to
accrue
after
that
18-month
period.
but
you
should...
but
it
is
the
taxpayer's
responsibility
to
know
what
their
tax
liability
is.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right,
but
that's
the
idea.
until
18...
until
1986
there
was
no
authority
at
all
for
the
secretary
to
abate,
and
then
congress
gave
the
secretary
that
authority
as
a
matter
of
grace
in
1986,
to
extend
this
relief
to
forgive
the
accrual
of
interest.
i
mean,
after
this
is
money--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--the
short
answer
is
because
congress
has
said
that,
said
that,
and
the
congress
decided
to
impose
the
net
worth
limitation.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right.
and
typically
when
congress
imposes
restrictions
on
a
remedy
this
court
reads
that,
reads
that
as
an
intentional--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
rational
basis
for--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--keep
in
mind,
this
is...
what
you're
talking
about
is,
this
is
interest
that's
running
on
money
that
the
taxpayer
is
borrowing
from
the
government.
this
is
money
that
the
government
is
legally
entitled
to
as
of
the
date
it
was
originally
due.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
and
so
this
is
money
that
the
taxpayer
is
borrowing.
a
large
net,
high
net
worth
taxpayer
can
invest
that
money
elsewhere
and
may
well
even
make
out
even
better.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
and
the
rational
basis
is
that
congress
believed
that
taxpayers
of
a
high
net
worth,
there
would
be
no
hardship,
but...
in
them
not
having
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
because
they
can
use
the
money,
invest
the
money.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
but
they're
not
as
well
positioned
as
the
wealthy
taxpayer,
so--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
first
of
all,
there
are
other
examples.
there's--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--this
is
derived
from,
ultimately
derived
from
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
there
are
attorneys'
fees
provisions,
but
also
assistance
to
taxpayers,
and
those
net
worth
limitations
apply
to--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
correct.
there
is
an--
administrative
claim
that--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
exactly
right.
and
justice
breyer,
if
you
want,
if
you--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--no.
he
does
have
the
authority.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yeah,
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
waive
interest.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
with
respect
to
taxpayers
who
meet
the
net
worth
limitations.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
and
there's
another--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
right.
it's
a
matter
of
administrative
grace
for
the
federal
taxpayers
who
are--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--they
have
an
enforceable
right.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
right.
there's
a
judicial
remedy
in
one
case
and
only
an
administrative
remedy
in
the
other.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
and
there's
another
provision
in
the
tax...
i'm
sorry,
justice
alito.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
it's
treating
exceedingly
high
net
worth
individuals
and
corporations
differently
from
everyone
else.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
they
could.
congress
chose
to
draw
the
line
where
it
used
this
provision
that
was
already
in
place
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
it
referred
to
that
provision--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right,
the
provision
that
applies
to
attorneys'
fees.
congress
has
also
imposed
this
provision
in
a
burden
shifting
provision
in
the
tax
code,
section
7491.
if
the
court
wants
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
congress's
concern
for
what
it
called
the
average
taxpayer,
or
the
smaller
taxpayers,
it
can
look
at
the
legislative
history.
there
was
a
hearing
in
march
of
1995
that's
cited
on
page
98
of
the
supplemental
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
and
that
was
the
court
of
federal
claims
decision.
it's
footnote
19.
it
refers
to
a
hearing
in
march
1995.
and
if
you
read
through
that,
you
can
see
where
that
concern
for
the...
for
average
taxpayers
and
lower
net
worth
taxpayers
came
from.
nothing
in
section
6404(h)
gives
rise
to
an
inference
that
congress
intended
to
establish
additional
remedies
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
federal
claims.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
has
consistently
applied
the
rule
that
when
congress
creates
a
specific
remedy,
it
intends
that
remedy
to
be
exclusive.
that
rule
is
fully
applicable
here.
otherwise,
the
specific
restrictions
congress
imposed
on
the
remedy
could
be
defeated
by
bringing
the
claim
in
a
different
forum.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that
might
have
made
it
simpler,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it
accomplished
the
same
result
by
imposing
the
specific
restrictions
that
it
did.
and
again,
it
would
have...
there's
another...
there
are
two
other
provisions
in
the
tax
code
where
congress...
where
the
tax
court
effectively
has...
one
of
the
provisions
where
the
tax
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
section
6330(d),
where
also
it
doesn't
specify
that...
the
congress
didn't
specify
the
tax
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
but
it
does.
and
there's
another
case
where
there's
an
administrative
determination,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
underlying
substantive
tax
liability.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
was
just
a
matter
of
not
being
a
standard
of
review.
i
think
it
was
a
matter
of
just
being,
of
intent
by
congress
to
have
this
just
be
a
matter
of
administrative
grace.
and
again,
if
you
contrast
the
language
of
the
different--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
think
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
government
cited,
but
i
think
there
was
others
as
well.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
if
you
have
a
legal
entitlement
to
it,
and
the
point
is
you
didn't
have
a
legal
entitlement
to
it
before.
that's
what
the
courts
held,
and
congress
responded
to
that,
not
by
saying
you
do
have
a
legally
entitlement
to
this
through
a
refund
action,
which
they
easily
could
have
said
if
they
wanted
to
reject
those
prior
decisions,
but
instead
they
created
a
limited
remedy
in
the
tax
court.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
that
limited
remedy
in
the
tax
court
to
give
rise
to
a
broader
remedy
that
doesn't
have
those
restrictions
that
congress
imposed
on
the
tax
court
remedy.
so
it
should
be...
i
think
6404(h)
should
be
read
as
an
integrated
whole
and
you
can't
just
extract
one
piece
and
then
bring
that
over,
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
to
apply
to
a
refund
action.
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
way
to
interpret
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer?
that
congress--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--right.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
characterize
it
as
the
closing
of
the
courthouse
door.
congress
opened
the
courthouse
door
in
a
limited
fashioning
in
1996.
that's
what
happened.
there
was
no
courthouse
door
opened
in--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
give
you
a
better
one
than
i
gave
before.
but
it's
that
high
net
worth
taxpayers
are
better
positioned
to
pay
their
full
tax
liability
up
front
and
to
handle
the
accumulation
of
interest
in
the
event
that
there
is
some
delay
in
the
processing
of
their
return.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
a
fine
way
of
looking
at
it,
justice
scalia.
the
other,
the
other
anomaly
the
fifth
circuit
identified
was
the
taxpayer,
the
taxpayer
seeking
a
refund
having
to
split
off
his
claims.
this
too
is
not
a
significant
anomaly.
the
vast
majority
of
taxpayers
seek
redetermination
of
their
tax
liability
in
the
tax
court
and
those
taxpayers
must
split
their
claims
because
the
interest
abatement
claim
doesn't
ripen
until
the
taxpayer's
underlying
liability
has
been
assessed.
moreover,
the
interest
abatement
question
is
distinct
from
the
taxpayer's
underlying
liability.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's...
if
they,
if
they,
if
they
got
relief
on
their
refund
claim,
if
they
prevail
on
their
refund
claim
there
would
be
no
need
to
do
that.
the
interest
would
automatically
abate.
but
if
they
were
unsuccessful
they
could
still
pursue
an
interest
abatement
on
the
grounds
that
the
irs
committed
an
error
in
delay
in
performing
a
material
act.
mr.

marcus
well,
it
would
be,
it
would
be
a
proceeding
that
would
follow
the
proceeding
on
the
underlying
liability.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
it's
not
as
inconvenient...
well,
it,
it
may
be
inconvenient
but
it's
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
exclusive
review
scheme
the
congress
set
up.
and
there
is
no
reason...
to
take
that
policy
concern
and
have
that
trump
the
statutory
language
and
the
regime
that
congress
clearly
established.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it
involves
questions
about
administrative
problems
that
might
arise
during
the
processing
of
the
taxpayer's
case.
a
ministerial
act,
the
failure
to
transfer
a
file
when
a
taxpayer
moves
from
one
jurisdiction
to
another,
or
after,
or
notice
of
deficiency
if
the
agent
just
delays
in
issuing
the
notice
because
he
forgot
about
it
and
it
just
sat
on
his
desk
for
a
couple
of
days.
those
are
the
kinds
of
issues
that,
that
come
up
in
interest
abatement
actions.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
