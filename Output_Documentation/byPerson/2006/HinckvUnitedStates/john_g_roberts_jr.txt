chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-376,
hinck
vs.
united
states.
mr.
redding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
with
respect
to
abatement
of
interest
in
particular.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why
would
you
not
want
some...
a
larger
taxpayer
to
be
able
to
proceed
in
the
tax
court
if
you
can
also
proceed
in
the
claims
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
no
basis
for
an
abatement
of
interest
action
apart
from
6404(h),
correct?
that
is
the
only
place
you
get
the
actual
cause
of
action
to
sue
for
abatement
of
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
would
you
cite
to,
in
response
to
the
prior
cases
that
said
you
had
no
cause
of
action
for
abasement
of
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
one
i'm
looking
at
just
has
(e)(1).
did
you
have
a
page
number?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure.
but...
but
that's
just
saying,
if...
you
used
to
have
the
entitlement
under
(e)(2)
and
you're
saying
well,
you
could
bring
cases
under
(e)(2).
but
6404(h)
allows
you
to
bring
cases
under
(e)(1).
it
would
follow
a
fortiori
that
you
could
bring
them
for
(e)(2)
as
well,
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
you
could
prove
them
under
(e)(1)
in
the
claims
court
or
the
district
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
went
into
the
district
court
and
claimed
that
the
failure
to
abate
interest
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
what
would
you
rely
on
for
the...
for
the
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
prior
cases
consistently,
consistently
said
that
there
was
no
judicial
review
because
it
was
6404(h)(1)
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
abuse
of
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
want
to
look
at
6404(h)(1)
saying
now
we
have
a
standard,
but
you
don't
want
the
other
stuff
that
goes
along
with
6404(h)(1),
which
is
it's
in
the
tax
court;
you
got
to
have
less
than
ten
million,
blah,
blah,
blah?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
there's
a
fundamental
difference
on
this
particular
question
between
pay
and
sue
and
sue--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--prepay,
because
if
you...
in
the
district
court
if
you're
paying
and
suing
you're
not
really
subject
to
the
accrual
of
interest,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
owe
the
irs,
1,000
dollars
and
they
send
me
a
bill
and
i
paid
the
1,000
dollars,
they've
got
the
money,
i
don't.
so
i
don't
owe
interest
on
that,
do
i?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
initial
bill
includes
the
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
still,
in
the
tax
court
situation
it's
still
accruing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
redding.
mr.
marcus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
the
cases
said
prior
to
6404(h)
when
they
asked
for
interest
abatement
was
not
that
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
that
claim.
they
would
just
say
there's
no
standard
to
apply,
so
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
then
all
of
a
sudden
6404(h)
comes
along
and
gives
you
a
standard,
so
that
removes
that
objection.
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
of
the
way
that
congress
enacted
the
language.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
tax
court
and
only
the
tax
court
shall
have
jurisdiction.
it
says
the
tax
court
shall
have
jurisdiction.
that
is
a,
in
many
respects
a
preferred
forum
and
they're
saying
you
can
bring
it
there
as
well,
but
it
doesn't
take
away
the
jurisdiction
that
the
prior
courts
had
recognized.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
you
think
it's
kind
of
strange,
though,
if
you
have
the
interest
abatement
is
available
only
for
a
particular
category
of
taxpayer
and
not
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
have
a
net
worth
of
two
million
and
one
dollar
you
can't
get
any
interest
abatement,
but
if
it's
$2
million
you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
you
abate
it
in
some
cases,
but
you
don't
abate
it
in
the
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought,
too.
but
then
your
friend
explained
that
in
the
initial
bill
is
where
the
interest
is
contained
in
a
lot
of
these
cases
and
in
this
case
in
particular.
so
it's
not
as
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
pay
it
in
advance
to
stop
the
accrual
of
interest.
just
you
get
the
bill
and
you
find
out,
you
know,
you
owe
a
1,000
dollars
and
300
of
it
is
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
difference...
the
difference
is
that
the
district
court,
the
claims
court
already
has
jurisdiction
for
pay
and
sue
claims,
if
you
pay
the
irs
you
can
sue
to
get
a
refund.
and
so
this
isn't
as
if
we're
looking
at
something
that
says
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
and
trying
to
use
that
as
a
wedge
to
get
other
jurisdiction.
there's
already
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
the
problem
was,
there
was
no
standard
of
review
for
these
may
abate
claims,
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
find
in
this
provision
there
is
a
standard
of
review,
it's
abuse
of
discretion,
and
that
fills
the
void.
why
can't
they
just
use
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
what
you
had
argued
before
when
people
would
try
to
seek
this
release
was
that
there's
no
standard
of
review
to
hold
the
secretary's
exercise
of
discretion
up
against.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
one
thing
you
never
said
was
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
because
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
if
you've
paid
money
to
the
irs
and
you
want
it
back,
you
can
bring
a
refund
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
they
bring
it
as
additional
claim
after
they
get
the
final
determination?
they
start
a
whole
separate
action
for
interest
abatement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
part
of
the
same
proceeding
or
is
it
a
separate
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
making
the
claim
that
it's
no
big
deal
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
district
court
to
get
your
refund
and
then
go
to
the
tax
court
to
get
the
interest
abatement,
which
does
seem
like
a
big
deal
to
me.
and
you
say,
well,
in
the
tax
court
you
have
to
do
it
separately,
too,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
is
the
same
proceeding
it
is
not
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
marcus.
mr.
redding,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-376
hinck
v.
united
states.
if
you
fail
to
pay
your
federal
taxes
when
they
are
due,
you
will
end
up
being
liable
not
only
for
the
taxes
but
for
interest
as
well.
occasionally
though,
you
donâ€™t
find
out
that
you
should
have
paid
taxes
until
some
time
has
passed
because
of
error
or
delays
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
in
such
cases
the
tax
court
says
you
can
ask
the
irs
to
abate
the
interest
to
forgive
it
in
whole
or
in
part.
now,
allowing
tax
payers
to
appeal
to
the
kindness
of
the
irs
worked
out
as
you
might
expect.
in
1996
congress
passed
the
provision
at
issuing
this
case,
section
6404(h)
of
the
tax
code,
which
allows
the
tax
payer
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
an
irs
decision
not
to
abate
interest.
section
6404(h)
provides
that
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
over
such
actions.
the
fifth
circuit
reasoned
that
district
courts
and
the
court
of
federal
claims
have
jurisdiction
as
well
because
they
have
general
jurisdiction
over
tax
refund
claims
and
section
6404(h)
makes
it
clear
that
this
type
of
claim
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
disagreed
ruling
that
interest
abatement
claims
could
be
brought
only
in
the
tax
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
agree
with
the
federal
circuit.
we
have
held
that
a
precisely
drawn
detailed
statute
preempts
more
general
remedies
and
section
6404(h)
does
not
simply
say
that
interest
abatement
claims
are
subject
to
judicial
review.
it
specified
where
such
claims
shall
be
brought
and
adds
other
features
to
the
new
remedy,
such
as
a
180
days
statute
of
limitations
and
the
net
worth
sealing
for
eligible
plaintiffs.
you
cannot
isolate
one
element
of
the
statute
the
provision
allowing
review
and
use
it
to
circumvent
the
other
limitations
included
in
the
same
statute.
congress
plainly
envisions
section
6404(h)
as
a
package
deal
and
one
part
of
that
package
was
the
provision
specifying
that
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
over
these
actions.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
