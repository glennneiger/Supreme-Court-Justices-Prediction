that's
a...
on
that
point,
mr.
redding,
it
seems
odd
that
given
this
tripartite
system,
congress
would
want
only
the
tax
court
to
be
restricted
in
the
people
who
could
claim
the
abatement,
the
net
worth
test
applicable
in
the
tax
court
on
your
theory,
if
there
is
authority
in
the
claims
court
and
in
the
district
courts,
they're
not
limited
to
the
net
worth
restrictions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
go
back
to
something
you
just
said,
that
i
thought
you
said
that
the
people
would
have
no
remedy
if
the
tax
court...
were
the
only
forum
for
abatement
claims?
and
it
would
be
the
exclusive
forum
but
nobody...
it
wouldn't
deny
access
to
anyone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
abatement
claim,
if
you
read
this
as
the
government
does,
is
one
place
where
you
go,
and
the
tax
court
but
everyone
who
has
an
abatement
claim
could
go
there.
so
who's
being
cut
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
yes.
but...
yes.
and
i
had
asked
you
before
well
doesn't
it
seem,
it
seems
strange
that
congress
would
want
to
limit
the
authority
of
the,
of
the
court
where
most
people
go
and
have
no
limit
for
the
wealthier
taxpayers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
congress
was
operating
on
the
assumption
that
no
court
could
hear
an
abatement
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
give
me
a
decision
of
the
claims
court
or
a
district
court
that
said
courts
have
authority
to
abate
the
interest
before
congress
enacted
this
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
didn't
exist
before
this
statute?
i
mean,
the
lower
courts
as
i
understand
it
said,
routinely,
yes,
you
can
have
jurisdiction,
but
have
you
no
claim
for
relief
because
there
is
no,
no
law
to
apply.
this
is
a
totally
discretionary
matter
of
the
commissioner's
grace.
so
congress
perhaps
didn't
grasp
the
subtle
distinction
between
no
jurisdiction,
and
you
can
walk
in
the
door
but
you
go
out
the
next
door,
because
there
is
no
justiciable
claim.
and
it
provided
peculiarly
in
the
tax
court
for
relief
that
was
not
available
anyplace
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
fifth
circuit...
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
went
your
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
went
your
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
was
for
purposes
of
attorneys'
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
have
been
simpler
if
congress
just
said
the
tax
court
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction,
instead
of
just
saying
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
is
no
linkage
between
the
two,
with,
it's
one
thing
to
split
a
claim
when
they
have
common
elements,
but
the
interest
abatement
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantive
underlying...
substantive
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
that
mr.
marcus
just
made,
that
the
issue
is
discrete
on
interest
abatement,
and
it
involves
mishandling
within
the
internal
revenue
processing,
and
it's
not
like
other
questions
that
have
to
do
with
the...
with
the
intricacies
of
the
internal
revenue
code--
