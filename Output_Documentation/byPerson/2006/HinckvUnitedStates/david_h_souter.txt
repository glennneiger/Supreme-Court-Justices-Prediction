of
the
appendix,
all...
all
there
is
is
a
subsection
1.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
know
how
much
to
pay,
do
you?
i
mean,
when
they
send
you
the
notice
they
don't
send
a
notice
that
says,
we're
looking
into
this
and
we
think
you're
going
to
end
up
owing
$5,000,
do
they?
they
don't
give
you
a
figure.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
name
a
figure
at
all--
justice
david
h.
souter
--when
they
give
you
the
initial
notice?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true.
but
you
can
make
that
argument.
that
argument,
if
you
accepted
it,
would
be
an
argument
for
having
no
amendment
to
subsection
(h)
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
question
is,
why
is
the
grace
confined
to
some
taxpayers
and
not
to
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
they've
said
it
if
we
accept
your
view
of
the
exclusivity
of
the
amendment
to
(h).
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
worthless.
okay.
now
i
guess,
if
you
can't
keep
the
poor
person
out
for
such
a
reason
then
you
can't
keep
the
rich
person
out
for
that
reason.
so
you
tell
me
what
the
rationale
is
in
keeping
the
rich
person
out
any
more
than
the
poor
person.
they
have
the
same
claim,
same
amount,
same
cause.
the
cause,
by
the
way,
was
that
some
bureaucrat
in
the
irs
forgot
to
send
a
notice
so
nobody
knew
what
was
happening.
that
was
the
cause.
and
the
reason
it
didn't
get
abated
is
because
a
different
bureaucrat
got
mixed
up,
okay?
same
claims.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the
standard
of
discretion
is
the
same
for
the
poor
and
the
rich,
isn't
it?
the
only
difference
is
that
the
poor
can
get
into
court
and
the
rich
cannot.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
question
of
remedy,
not
standing.
