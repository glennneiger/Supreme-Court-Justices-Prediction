justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
(e)(2)?
is
it
produced
in
these
materials.
i
got
(e)(1);
i
don't
have
(e)(2).
i
don't
really
like
talking
about
a
section
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
one
thing
about
this
case
i'm
sure
about.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
easy
to
see
why
the
only
cases
you
have
relate
to
(e)(2)
rather
than
(e)(1).
(e)(2)
which
we
don't
have
in
the
materials,
but
i
have
gotten
a
copy
of
it.
and
(e)(1)
says
that
the
secretary
"may"
abate
the
assessment
of
all
or
any
part.
and
those
cases
that
denied
it
said
this
is
discretionary;
he
doesn't
have
to.
(e)(2)
on
the
other
hand,
interest
abated
with
respect
to
erroneous
refund
check,
says
the
secretary
"shall"
abate
the
assessment.
so
really,
(e)(2)
doesn't...
doesn't
do
you
any
good
at
all
with
respect
to
whether
there
was
a
cause
of
action
before--
(h)
was
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
what
you're
say
is
that
cases
that
used
to
be
bringable
under
(e)(2)
would
now
be
bringable
only
under
(h)
which
would
in
effect
be
an
implicit
repeal
of
(e)(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
as
far
as
suits
elsewhere
than
in
the
tax
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
redding,
let
me
come
back
to
the
phantom
(e)(2)
which
we
have
finally
traced
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
sure
that
(h)
would
impliedly
repeal
(e)(2),
because
(e)(2)
is
mandatory.
there
isn't
any
question
under
(e)(2)
whether
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
there
is
no
discretion.
it
is
mandatory
to
the
extent
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
govern
(e)(2),
it
would
be
for
a
violation
of
law
not
for
abuse
of
discretion.
so
when
(h)
says
the
tax
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
secretary's
failure
to
abate
interest
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
i
would
take
that
to
apply
only
to
(e)(1),
which
says
the
secretary
may
abate
and
not
to
(e)(2)
which
says
the
secretary
shall
abate.
there
is
no
question
of...
of
discretion
in
(e)(2)
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
pretty
good
argument,
i
thought.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
those
other
sections,
(c)
and
(d),
which
say
the
secretary
is
authorized?
have
there
been
cases
which,
which
said
that
you
could
sue
for,
for
his
failure
to
make
use
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
as
with
(e)?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
with
(e)(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
did
(h)
apply
to
(e)(2)
as
well
as
to
(e)(1)?
does
it
apply
only
to
discretionary
abatement
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
happens
with
(e)(2)?
you
use
the
pay
and
sue
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't,
i
don't
even
think
it's
technically
correct.
how
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion?
he
has
no
discretion.
he
must
do
it.
how
could
you
say
he
has
abused
his
discretion?
what
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
doesn't
even
know
what
his
tax
liability
is,
especially
in
a
partnership
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
makes
the
partnership
calculation,
it
goes
to
the
irs,
and
then
they
figure
out
what
the
tax
is.
and
meanwhile,
you
know,
the
interest
is
running.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
quite
a
different
argument.
you're
saying,
you
know,
he
should
have
paid
the
full
tax
in
the
first
place,
not
he
could
have
paid
the
interest
that
he
knew
was
accruing.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
didn't
understand
that.
say
that
again?
there's
no
abatement
for
the
interest
that
accrues
until
you're
notified
of
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
next
thing
you
know,
they
will
enact
a
progressive
income
tax.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
you
cannot
enter
the
courthouse
provision
here,
or
is
it...
as
i
understand
your
case,
it
is
that
it
remains
discretionary
with
the
secretary
with
respect
to
people
who
have
more
money,
but
it
is
not
discretionary
with
respect
to
people
who
have
less
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
one
has
a
cause
of--
action
and
the
other
doesn't
have
a
cause
of
action.
and
the
difference
you're
making
between
the
two
is
you're
permitting
the
secretary
to
waive
the
interest
with
respect
to
the
rich.
you're
requiring
him
to
do
it
with
respect
to
the
poor.
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
permissive,
not
mandatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
doesn't
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wait
a
minute.
they
are
not
really
saying
that.
they're
saying
it's
totally
within
your
discretion.
you
can't
possibly
abuse
your
discretion
when
you
have
total
discretion.
they're
just
saying,
you
know,
do
it
if
you
want
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
not
concede,
as
you
seem
to
have,
that
the
consequence
of
(h)
is
simply
to
open
the
door.
i
think
the
category
of
decisions
that
are
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
apa
are
agency
decisions
as
to
which
the
term
"abuse
of
discretion"
makes
no
sense.
there's
no
such
thing.
it
is
totally
committed
to
agency
discretion.
it's
only
other
decisions
that
are
not
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
where
you...
where
the
discretion
can
be
abused.
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
closing
the
door
to
one
category
and
opening
it
to
another;
it's
a
matter
of
different
substantive
laws
applying
to
the
two,
to
the
two
classes.
anyway,
i
choose
to
look
at
it
that
way.
you
can
talk--
justice
antonin
scalia
who
said
that?
