justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
apply
just
to
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
:
doesn't
the
new
statute
just
apply
to
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
you
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
it's
an
abusive
discretion.
maybe
i'm
reading
the
wrong
place.
6404--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
well
that
standard
doesn't
apply
to
the
(e)(2).
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it;
(e)(2)
says
if
it's
a
refund,
abate,
if
not,
not.
it's
not
a
question
of
abuse
of
discretion
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
is
there
any
other
instance
in
the
law?
i
suppose
there
probably
is,
but
what
surprised
me
about
that
is
this:
imagine
we
have
two
citizens
and
they
are
identical
in
every
respect
in
terms
of
their
claim,
they
each
believe
the
government
owes
them
$50,000.
they
each
have
identically
strong
claims.
and
congress
passes
a
law
and
says
one
of
you
can
come
into
court
and
the
other
can't.
now
suppose
it
said
the
poor
person
can't
come
into
court.
do
you
think
there
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional
problem
there?
remember,
they
have
the
same
claim
for
the
same
amount,
with
the
same
precise
strength
of
their
argument.
but
we
say
rich
people
can
go
in,
and
we'd
say
why
did
you
do
that?
we
say
poor
people
don't
have
as
much
stake
in
society.
they
don't
have...
now
suppose
you
heard
such
an
argument.
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
feel
there's
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
rational
basis
is
that
the
poor
person
doesn't
have
the
stake
in
society
that
a
rich
one
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
claim
happens
to
be
interest
worth
$5,000.
the
irs
abused
its
discretion
under
the
statute
in
failing
to
write
a
check
for
$5,000
to
both.
what
we
do
is
we
allow
one
of
them
to
bring
a
lawsuit
to
get
the
5,000,
and
we
say
to
the
other
one,
you
can't
bring
the
lawsuit
to
get
the
5,000.
now
my
question
is,
what's
the
basis
for
that
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
there
be
no
hardship?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
can
a
poor
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
progressive
income
tax.
what
i
have
not
seen
anywhere
is
the
use
of
wealth,
totally
different
from
the
dollar
value
of
a
claim,
to
shut
the
courthouse
door.
i'm
just
saying,
is
there
such
a
case
anywhere,
and
if
there
is
no
such
case,
then
i'd
say
i
wonder
about
this
assumption.
the
assumption
that
the
reason
that
you
cannot
keep
the
courthouse
door
open
to
everyone
is
because
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
know,
attorneys'
fees
you
give
to
poor
people
more
than
to
rich
people.
that
makes
sense.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
having
a
formal
rule
saying
you
cannot
enter
the
courthouse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
that
might
be
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
there
are
two
separate
things.
i
want
to
understand
this.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
does
not
have
the
power
to
abate
the
interest
in
respect
to
the
rich
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can
do
it...
in
the
first
case
with
the
rich
person,
he
can
abuse
his
discretion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
in
the
one
case
congress
has
passed
a
law
saying
with
a
poor
person
you
cannot
abuse
your
discretion,
but
with
a
rich
person
you
can
abuse
your
discretion.
that's
what
the--
underlying
substantive
statute
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
now
think
maybe
i
don't
agree
on
this
point
that
there
are
different
standards,
because
it
does
say
in
this
abuse
of
discretion.
and
indeed
that's
a
normal
administrative
standard,
and
so
as
you
read
this
you
would
think
that
the
irs
does
not
have
any
legal
power
substantively
to
abuse
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
bring
an
abasement
in
refusing
to
bring
an
abatement...
excuse
me,
to
abate
the
interest.
so
far
do
you
agree?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
once
they
make
clear
that
the
standard
is
abuse
of
discretion,
it
only
makes
clear
what's
there
in
the
law
anyway,
that
administrative
authorities
do
not
have
the
authority
to
abuse
their
discretion.
now,
sometimes
we
don't
review
that
in
the
courts.
that
doesn't
make
it
legal.
it
just
means
you
can't
catch
them
out
in
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
a
standard
that
applies
to
everybody.
then
all
that
this
does,
to
go
back
to
it
is
it
closes
the
courthouse
door.
now
i
want
to
know
what
your
rationale
was
for
doing
that?
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
standards
that
applied.
it
has
to
have
something
to
do
with
why
one
class
of
people
by
wealth
are
kept
out
of
court.
i
think
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
it
wouldn't
last
for
three
seconds,
and
the
only
reason
maybe
i
don't
think
about
it
as
hard
this
way
because
i
think,
well,
privilege
is
involved,
etcetera.
but
when
you
force
me
to
think
about
it,
i
want
to
know
what
the
reason
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
accept
that
characterization.
now
you
give
me
the
reason
why
we've
opened
the
courthouse
door
to
individuals
who
are
alike
in
every
respect
but
for
their
net
worth?
now
give
me
that,
the
same
reason?
i
always
want
to
know
what
the
specific
reason
is,
the
specific
rationale
and.
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't
one.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is.
