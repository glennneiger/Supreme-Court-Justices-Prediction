we'll
hear
argument
in
bp
america
production
company
against
the
secretary.
mr.
lamken.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
also,
i
assume,
true
that
the
demand
letter
would
not
toll
a
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lamken--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
we
go
back
to
section
(i)
for
a
second
more?
is
it
also
possible
to
say
that
there
was
this
disagreement
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
comptroller
general,
and
congress
decided
that
the
comptroller
general
was
right?
and,
if
that's
true,
should
we
not
accept
the
comptroller
general's
reading
of
the
entire
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--legislative
history
tell
us
how
detailed
the
congressional
examination
of
the
particular
issue
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
about
all--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
joseffer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
time
lapse--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
we
know,
in
this
case,
what
time
lapse
there
was
between
the
issue
letter
and
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
that...
if
you
took
the
issue
letter
as
the
day,
wouldn't
all
of
the...
all
of
the
government's
claims
be
timely?
because
we're
only
talking
about
part
of
the
claim,
anyway,
as
i
understand
it.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
be
some
in
dispute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
a
case
involving
the
oneida
indians,
that
went
back
quite
a
ways--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--200
years--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
joseffer.
mr.
lamken,
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
about
11
minutes
left.
you
don't
have
to
use
them
all.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lamken,
have
you
had
any
second
thoughts
about
your
position
that
it's
the
order,
rather
than
the
issue
letter,
that
we
should
look
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
suggest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this,
mr.
lamken,
that
when
the...
when
the
filing
is
made
giving
us
the
olc
opinion,
you
include
a...
an
example
of
such
a
letter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
we'll
get
a
notion
of
what
it
looks
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
the
case
is
taken...
is...
as
submitted.
