mr.
daryl
joseffer
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
presumption
is
that
the
government
is
not
bound
by
a
statute
of
limitations.
and,
when
read
as
a
whole,
section
2415(a)
does
not
overcome
that
presumption,
but
instead
makes
clear
that
it
applies
only
to
suits
in
court.
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first,
the
ordinary
meanings
of
all
of
the
key
statutory
terms
refer
to
suits
in
court.
second,
the
statute
expressly
distinguishes
between
administrative
proceedings
and
actions.
third
the
statute's
located
in
the
judicial
code.
fourth,
the
committee
reports,
for
those
who
are
inclined
to
consider
them,
strongly
support
the
statute's
ordinary
meaning.
and,
fifth,
even
if
some
administrative
proceedings
were
governed
by
section
2415(a),
these
would
not,
because
they
do
not
involve
a
complaint.
now,
on
the
first
of
those
points,
the
term
7
years
ago,
in
west
v.
gibson,
every
member
of
this
court
agreed
that
the
term
"action"
often
refers
only
to
suits
in
court,
and
not
to
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
the
structure
of
the
law
here
is
that
in
those
instances
where
congress
does
authorize
administrative
recovery,
it
ordinarily
provides
a
context-specific
administrative
limitations
period,
such
as
in
the
contract
disputes
act,
which
governs
almost
all
of
the
contract
claims
the
government
can
pursue
administratively.
congress
specifically
enacted
a
6-year
limitations
period
for
the
submission
of
a
claim
to
a
contracting
officer.
in
this
unique
context,
however,
congress
had
very
good
reasons
for
not
applying
a
limitations
period
until
it
prospectively
enacted
a
partial
one
in
1996.
the
reason
is
that
what
congress
found
here,
in
context
of
mineral
leasing,
based
on
the
findings
of
an
independent
commission,
was
that
the
companies
were
historically
on
an
honors
system
and
had
abused
that
by
underpaying
royalties
of
up
to
half
a
billion
dollars
annually.
so,
what
congress
directed
the
agency
to
do
is
to
audit
all
current
and
past
lease
accounts.
one
of
the
committee
reports
said
to
focus
on
old
accounts,
because
this
was
a
congress
that
was
not
concerned
with
repose,
but
with
getting
some
of
those
vast
underpayments
back
from
the
companies.
now,
when
we
fast-forward
to
1996--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--at
that
point--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
i...
agreed.
what
i'm
referring
to
now
is
the
congress
that
enacted
the
mineral
leasing
provisions.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--which
is
not
a
good--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
but...
well,
we
are,
because
the
structure
of
the
law
here
is
that
section
2415(a),
as
we
see
it,
governs
court
suits.
and
that
works,
because,
when
congress
authorizes
administrative
recovery,
it
almost
always
provides
a
specific...
context-specific
administrative
limitations
period.
also,
when
congress
was
telling
the
agency
to
focus
on
old
accounts,
it
certainly
wasn't
thinking
that
a
statute
of
limitations
applied
to
that,
and
the
agency,
in
that
contemporary
context,
did
not
understand
that
there
was
a
limitations
period,
either,
because
the
orders
that
issued
in
the
aftermath
of
the
1982
act
went
back
7,
8,
9,
sometimes
more,
years
than
that.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no,
the
justice
department--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
the
olc
opinion
was
limited,
by
both
its
terms
and
its
reasoning,
to
administrative
offsets,
not
to
administrative
adjudications.
and
if
i
could
explain
that,
an
administrative
offset
occurs
in
the
situation...
this
is
what
olc
was
looking
at...
where
the
government,
by
statute,
owed
retirement
benefits
to
a
person,
and,
because
it
thought
that
person
owed
it
money,
what
the
government
did
was
to
unilaterally
reduce
the
retirement
benefits.
what
olc
opined
is
that
that
is
a...
nothing
more
than
a
prejudgment
attachment.
and
olc
thought
that
if
the
government
is
time-barred
from
obtaining
a
judgment,
it
should
be
time-barred
from
obtaining
a
prejudgment
attachment.
an
administrative
adjudication
is
significantly
different,
because
it
does
provide
an
actual
judgment.
so,
there
are
a
couple
of
important
points
from
that.
first
is
that
the
dispute
between
olc
and
the
comptroller
general
was
limited
by
its
terms
to
administrative
offsets,
although,
justice
stevens,
the
comptroller
general
did
opine
beyond
that,
that
the
statute
specifically
applies
only
to
suits
in
court.
but
the
actual
dispute
was
as
to
administrative
offsets.
so,
when
congress
addressed
that
specific
dispute,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
it
resolved
only
that
specific
dispute.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no,
the
position
of
olc
was
limited
to
administrative
offsets,
and
it
did
not...
the
important
thing
is,
olc
opinion
did
not
interpret
the
statutory
term
"action",
or,
frankly,
any
other
statutory
term.
instead,
it
had
a
theory,
which
was
probably
wrong,
that
administrative
offsets
are
unique
because
they
are
prejudgment
attachment
devices.
that's
the
dispute
that
went
to
congress,
and
that's
the
dispute
that
congress
actually
resolved.
and,
in
any
event,
going
forward--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
the
olc's
view
is
that
if
the
government
was
time-barred
from
obtaining
a
judgment
under
section
2415(a),
then
it
would
be
time-barred
from
obtaining
a
prejudgment
attachment.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
think
what's
wrong
with
the
logic
is
what
was
wrong
with
the
logic
of
the
olc
opinion.
we
don't
mean
to
defend
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--reasoning
of
the
olc
opinion--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--but
what
olc
really
did
say...
and
comptroller
general
and
congress
promptly
disagreed...
was
that...
it
didn't
see
a
problem...
olc
didn't
see
a
problem
with
procedurally
imposing
an
administrative
offset.
what
it
saw
a
problem
with
was,
it
thought
if
an...
a
judgment
would
be
time-barred,
then
a
prejudgment
attachment
should
be
time-barred,
as
well.
i
mean,
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--olc
opinion,
which--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
agree
was--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
the...
i
guess
it
was
another
point.
the
olc
opinion
was...
arose
in
the
context
where
a
judgment
could
be
obtained
at
all
only
in
court.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
in
the
context
of--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it
was
unpublished,
and--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--petitioners
offered
to
lodge
it
with
the
court--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i'll...
we'll
do
it
this
afternoon.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
point's
just...
the
olc
reasoning
was
admittedly
somewhat
odd,
but
that
was
the
context
in
which
congress
was
responding
to.
and,
going
forward,
it
is
not
surplusage,
because
the
issue
still
arises.
if
the
government
could
pursue
its
suit
only
in
court,
it
would
be
time-barred
from
pursuing
a
suit
in
court.
the
question
would
then
still
arise,
under
the
olc
opinion,
unless
it
had
been
overruled,
whether
the
government
could,
nonetheless,
obtain
a
prejudgment
attachment,
even
though
it
cannot
obtain
judgment.
that's
all
that
congress
was
looking
at
there.
and,
as
this
court's
recognized
in
cases
like
o'gilvie
and
vonn,
when
congress
amends
a
statue
to
resolve
a
specific
dispute,
oftentimes
its
amendments
should
be
read
as
doing
no
more
than
that.
we...
i
agree,
though,
that
terms...
to
get
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
discussion...
terms
do
not
always
have
their
ordinary
meanings,
but
they
presumptively
do,
especially
when
a
statute
must
be
strictly
construed.
and
here,
the
context
confirms
that
"action"
does
have
its
ordinary
meaning,
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
ordinary
meanings
of
the
other
key
statutory
terms,
such
as
"right
of
action",
"complaint",
and
"defendant",
as
justice
ginsberg
pointed
out,
all
ordinarily
refer
to
aspects
of
suits
in
court.
a
"right
of
action"
is
the
right
to
bring
a
suit
in
court;
a
"defendant"
is
the
person
defending
in
court
ordinarily;
and
a
"complaint"
is
the
document
that
initiates
proceedings
by
stating
a
claim
that's
seeking
relief
in
a
civil
action,
which
is
a
suit
in
court.
especially
when
those
terms
are
used
together,
this
court
recognized,
in
unexcelled
chemical,
that
a
reference
to
commencing
a
action
by
filing
a
complaint
ordinarily
refers
to
filing
a
suit
in
court,
not
a
pleading
before
an
administrative
agency.
the
statute
then
goes
on
to
expressly
juxtapose
an
action
against
an
administrative
proceeding
by
saying
that
the
time
to
file
an
action
does
not
run
until
after
the
administrative
proceedings
have
concluded,
which
certainly
gives
weight
to
the
point
that
the
action
is...
an
administrative
proceeding
is
not
an
action.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it's
2415.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
ones
that
we
have
found
were...
i'm
not
100-percent
sure,
but
the
ones
that
we...
that
we
have
found
and
cited
in
our
brief
do
appear
to
be
enacted
after
that
time.
i
think
the
reason
is
that...
i
mean,
historically,
administrative...
obviously,
court
suits
have
been
around
a
lot
longer
than
administrative
adjudications.
and,
as
congress
has
authorized
administrative
adjudications,
it's
dealt
with
them
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
every
time
that
it
enacted
a
context-specific
administrative
adjudications
period
since
1966...
in
theory,
it
could
have
just
done
an
across-the-board
one
for
all
agency
adjudications,
but,
instead,
it's
chosen
to
deal
with
the
context-specific;
in
part,
because
of
the
great
variety
of
administrative
procedure.
i
mean,
as
this
case
illustrates,
a
statute
of
limitations
that
governs
a
complaint
in
an
action
is
just
not
going
to
work
in
a
lot
of
administrative
contexts.
here,
there's
no
complaint.
an
"order"
is
a
legally
binding
order.
it
doesn't
seek
relief,
it
imposes
it.
and
unless
it
is
both
appealed
and
stayed
pending
appeal--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
there's...
there
are
basically
three
steps
here.
first,
there's
an
audit.
then,
if
the
audit
reveals
an
apparent
discrepancy,
the
agency
or
a
state
with
delegate
authority
would
send
an
issue
letter
requesting
an
explanation.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
it's
called
an
"issue
letter".
and
then
would
basically
request
an
explanation
of
the
apparent
discrepancy.
and
then,
if
the
agency
then
decides,
after
consideration
of
the
audit
and
the
issue
letter,
that
it's
appropriate
to
issue
an
order
to
pay
it,
will
do
so.
it--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--an
issue
letter?
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
don't
know
whether
you
mean
the
audit--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--or
the
issue
letter,
but
either
way--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
well,
there
are
a
few
things.
first,
on
the...
with
respect
to
the
issue
letter...
i
mean,
a
complaint,
functionally,
is
a
document
that
initiates
proceedings,
stating
it...
by
stating
the
claim
for
relief,
is
seeking
relief
in
a
civil
action.
with
respect
to
the
second
of
those,
an
issue
letter
does
not...
is
not
an
allegation
of
wrongdoing,
and
it
does
not
seek
relief;
it
seeks
information
so
that
the
agency
can
determine
whether
or
not
an
apparent
discrepancy
raised
by
an
audit
is,
in
fact,
a
discrepancy.
but
there's--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no
claim.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
what
it...
what
it
asserts
is
that,
"we've
done
an
audit,
and
the
audit
has
raised
the
following
issues.
"
--that's
why
it's
called
an
"issue
letter"...
"please
provide
an
explanation".
and
it...
so,
at
that
point,
the
agency
has
not
decided
yet
whether
it
is,
in
fact,
asserting
a
claim.
it's
not...
and
it's
not
requesting
relief,
which
a
complaint
definitely
does.
all
it's
requesting
is
information
to
help
the
agency
assess
the
issue.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
no,
in
fact,
it's
not
even...
in
fact,
it's
not
even
in
the
administrative
record--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--which
is
one
of
the
reasons
it's
not
in
the
issue--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--record
of
the
case--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--which
also
reflects
that
it's
not
a
formal
complaint,
or
it
would
be
in
the
record.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
don't
think
it
was
more
than
a
year
or
two.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
and
there
was--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--here,
i
think
if
you
ran--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes,
if
it
ran
from
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--if
it
ran
from
the
issue
letter--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
think
there
would
still
be
about
a
year
in
dispute
here.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
but--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes,
and
the
reason
is
that
that's
what
congress
chose
to
do.
i
mean,
in
the
prospective
1996
act,
it--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--enacted
the
limitations--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
there's
no
explanation.
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
the
prospective
1996
legislation
governs
a
wide
variety
of
aspects
of
the...
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
lessees.
and,
on
balance,
that
package
was
pretty
favorable
to
the
oil
companies,
and
i
think
congress
probably
just
decided
not
to...
to
apply
that
to
itself,
but
not
to
the
indians.
getting
back
to
the
order,
though,
it's
not
only
that--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
as
a--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
first
off,
until--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
well,
there
are
a
few
points,
both
legal
and
practical.
on
the
legal,
until
1966
that
absolutely
was
the
law,
because
historically
no
limitations
period
ever
applies
against
the
government.
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
strict
construction
canon,
that
the
statute
applies
here
only
if
it
clearly
applies,
and
thereby
bars
the
government
from
forcing
the
law
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
not
contract.
i
mean,
the
historic
rule
is
that
the
government
is
not
bound
by
statutes
of
limitations,
because
what
it's
doing
is
enforcing
the
law
in
the
public
interest.
now,
in
1966,
congress
enacted
section
2415(a)
so
that
there
would
prospectively
be
a
contract
limitations
period.
but
it's
strictly
construed,
because
of
the
historical
backdrop
and
the
importance
of
enforcing
the
law
in
the
public
interest.
so
that's
why
we
do
have
a
strict
construction
canon
here.
as
a--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--for
the
same
reason
laches
is
never
applied
against
the
government.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
as
an
abstract
theoretical
matter,
the
government
could
reach
back
many,
many
decades.
as
a
practical
matter,
though,
that's
never
happened
that
we've
gone
back,
say,
50
or
100
years
and
there
are
practical
reasons
for
that.
first
is
that
the
agency
does
not
have
enough
resources
to
audit--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--that's
true.
it's...
i
meant
in
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--leasing
context
here.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
didn't
mean
in
the
leasing
context
here.
but
in
the
leasing
context,
one...
there
are
a
couple
of
important
points.
one
is
that
the
government
does
not
have
enough
resources
to
audit
all
of
the
current
accounts
in
all
of
the
years,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
need
to
be
able
to
go
back
farther
when
we
catch
the
violation.
as
a...
but
as
a
result,
the
notion
that
we're
going
to
pull
auditing
resources
off
of
today
to
do
a
frolicking
detour
into
50
years
ago,
there's
a
reason
that's
never
happened.
in
addition,
the
farther
we
try
to
go
back,
the
greater
the
proof
problems,
because
oftentimes
only
the
companies
have
the
information
that
shows
what
royalties
they
would
owe,
and
if
they
lawfully
destroy
those
records
after
6
years,
it
makes
it
even
harder
for
us
to
try
to
go
back,
because
of
proof
problems.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
no,
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
first,
it's
optional,
not
mandatory.
if
they
want
to
keep
them,
they--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--certainly
can.
but
there's
no...
and,
as
a
practical
matter...
i
mean,
because
the
government
bears
the
initial
burden
of
going
forward,
if
the
company
destroys
the
sources
of
proof,
that's,
on
balance,
going
to
be
in
its
favor.
but,
in
addition,
there's
not
a
strict
congruence
between
the
6-year
periods,
because,
first,
the
companies
only
have
to
keep
records
for
6
years,
but,
in
some
circumstances,
the
secretary
can
require
they
be
kept
for
longer.
in
addition,
sometimes
the
statute
of
limitations,
because
of
tolling,
is
much
longer
than
6
years;
and
so,
the
lawful
destruction
of
records
would
still
leave
absence-of-proof
issues
in
situations
where
the
statute
might,
because
of
tolling,
be
much
longer.
so,
there's
not
a
strict
congruence.
there
is
also
no
indication
that
congress
enacted
the
6-year
records-retention
policy
because
it
was
thinking
about
a
6-year
limitations
period.
there's
never
been
any
linkage
between
the
two.
if
i
could
briefly
cover,
then,
also...
i
mean,
in
addition
to
all
the
textual
points,
this
is
also
located
in
the
judicial
code.
and,
although
it's
true
that
a
couple
stray
provisions
in
the
judicial
code
apply
to
administrative
proceedings,
they
say
that
expressly.
every
time
the
word
"action"
is
used
in
the
judicial
code...
and
petitioners
identified
no
examples...
every
time
the
word
"action"
is
used
in
the
judicial
code,
it
refers
to
a
suit
in
court,
and
only
a
suit
in
court.
when
a
provision
of
the
judicial
code
applies
to
something
else,
it
will
say
so.
for
example,
28
u.s.
code
2462,
which
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
penalty
proceedings,
refers
to
an
"action,
suit,
or
proceeding.
"
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
very
clear
that
what
it's
talking
about
is
submitting
something
to
an
agency.
so,
if
congress
was
going
to
legislate
against
the
backdrop
of
a
strict
construction
canon
with
terms
that
ordinarily
refer
to
suits
in
court,
and
put
the
provision
in
the
judicial
code,
i
mean,
that
just
is
a
totally
irrational
way
of
expressing
intent,
especially
clear...
especially
a
clear
intent,
when
it's
trying
to
govern
administrative
proceedings.
the
committee
reports
also
strongly
confirm
that,
because
they
not
only
say
that
the
statute
defines
the
time
limitation
for
bringing
an
action
in
the
u.s.
courts,
and
not
only
use
court
terminology
from
front
to
back,
they
also
say,
like
the
statute,
that
they're
aware
of
the
administrative
proceedings,
but
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
time
to
bring
an
action
in
the
courts
does
not
expire
until
after
the
conclusion
of
those
proceedings.
the
committee
has
explained
that
the
reason
for
that
provision
was
the
great
number
and
variety
of
administrative
proceedings.
so,
in
other
words,
congress
was
saying,
"there's
a
great
variety
of
administrative
procedure.
"
"we're
just
not
going
to
deal
with
that
here.
"
"we're
taking
it
off
the
table
by
saying
this
limitations
period
does
not
expire
until
a
year
after
those
administrative
proceedings,
whatever
they
might
be,
have
expired.
"
there's
also
some
relevance
in
the
fact
that
this
legislation
was
proposed
by
the
justice
department
as
part
of
an
overall
package
of
reforms
that
would
govern
the
civil
litigation
that
the
department
was
handling
in
the
courts.
it
was
then
referred
to
the
judiciary
committees,
not
to
the
house
government
reform
committees
that
might
consider
administrative
procedure
matters,
and,
as
i
mentioned
before,
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
judicial
code.
from
start
to
finish,
this
legislation
has
never
had
anything
to
do
with
anything
other
than
court
suits,
which
is
why
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
context-specific
administrative
systems...
limitations
periods...
which
make
sense
in
the
context
of
the
relevant
administrative
procedures.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it's
(i).
it
is
(i).
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
the
reason
is
that--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
mean,
it's...
there's
no
doubt
the
statute
should
be
read
as
a
whole.
but,
as
this
court
has
explained
in
cases
like
the
o'gilvie
and
vonn
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
when
a
court's
trying
to
make
sense
of
a
statute
read
as
a
whole,
oftentimes
it
will
find
that
when
congress
faces
a
specific
dispute
and
amends
a
statute
to
resolve
that
specific
dispute,
that's
all
it
resolves,
and
there's
no
reason
to
draw
further
negative
inference,
especially
here,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
where
a
strict
construction
canon
applies.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
because...
i
mean,
and
it
is
an
important
point,
that
the
statute
applies
only
if
it
clearly
applies
by
its
terms.
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
best
that
petitioners
can
do
is
to
say
that
some
of
the
statutory
terms,
in
isolation,
are
ambiguous.
but
that...
all
that
means,
as
i
said,
is
that,
under
the
strict
construction
canon,
we
would
prevail.
and
even
if
the
statute
governs
some
administrative
proceedings,
but
not
others,
it
would
not
govern
these,
for
the
reason
i
gave
earlier,
which
is
that
there's
no
complaint
here.
we
talked,
before,
about
the
ways
in
which
an
order
is
not
a
complaint.
it's
another
important
point,
though,
that
in
order
not
only...
it
is...
not
only
does
it
not
begin
the
proceedings,
it
normally
ends
them,
because
appeals
are
only
taken
about
a
quarter
of
the
time.
and
in
some
limited
circumstances
there's
not
even
a
right
of
appeal,
if
the
assistant
secretary
issued
the
order.
so--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--correct.
it's...
the
only
argument
they've
ever
made--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--is
that
an
"order"
is
a
complaint.
so,
they
haven't
preserved
the
point.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
but--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--correct.
there's
no...
in
an
issue
letter,
there's
no
claim
for
relief,
just
a
claim
for
the
request
for
information,
and
there's
no
allegation
of
wrongdoing.
so,
it's
just
not
a
complaint
in
those
ways.
also,
it
doesn't...
it's
not
really
fair
to
say
that
it
begins
proceedings,
because
it
comes
between
an
audit
and
an
order
to
pay.
so
it
doesn't...
and
plus,
it's,
of
course,
not
filed
in
a
civil
action.
and,
in
that
respect,
it
doesn't
satisfy
any
of
the...
any
of
the
elements
of
the...
of
the
ordinary
definition
of
"complaints".
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we...
well,
our
primary
submission
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
any
administrative
proceedings,
for
the
reason...
reasons
i've
given,
that
the
ordinary
meanings
of
all
of
the
key
statutory
terms
are
for
suits
in
court.
a
"complaint"
itself
is
ordinarily
defined
to
be--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--there
are...
there
are
some
contexts
in
administrative
procedure
in
which
the
word
"complaint"
is
used.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
because
it's
not
filed
in
an
"action",
which
refers
to
a
suit
in
court,
following
occurral
of
a
right
of
action,
which
refers
to
the
right
to
bring
suit
in
court,
in
a
statute
which
then
juxtaposes
the
terms
"action"
against
"administrative
proceedings"--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
and
it's
a
much
more--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--fundamental
point
than
that,
too,
is
that
what
congress
was
doing
here
was,
when
using
these
terms
in
their
ordinary
sense,
to
lay
out
an
across...
the-board
rule
that
applies
to
suits
in
court.
and,
finally,
one
thing
i
should
also
emphasize
is
that
what
we
have
in
this
context
is
a
comprehensive
administrative
scheme.
petitioners
like
to
say
that,
"well,
we
could
just
as
easily
be
in
court.
"
there's
a
reason
that
no
administrative
royalty
proceeding
has
ever
been
brought
by
the
government
in
a
court.
and
that's,
first,
that
congress
directed
the
agency
to
establish
a
comprehensive
auditing
and
collection
system,
and
then
gave
the
agency
administrative
authority
to
enforce
its
administrative
orders.
the
only
way
the
agency
could
administer
thousands
of
leases
with
something
like
$9
billion
in
royalties
every
year
is
to
do
this
in
an
efficient
administrative
manner.
congress
has
not
only
authorized
that,
and
ratified
it,
it
has
strengthened
that
scheme
and
told
the
agency,
as
i
said,
in
1982,
to
go
back
and
look
at
old
leases,
precisely
because
congress
knew
that
is
a
standalone
administrative
scheme,
and
it's
never
provided
the
administrative
limitations
period
for
the
standalone
administrative
scheme.
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
