mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
2415(a)
established
a
limitations
period
for
every
action
for
money
damages
by
the
government
which
is
founded
on
any
contract.
that
provision,
by
its
terms,
applies
to
every
contract
action,
every
adversary
adjudication
seeking
monetary
compensation
for
breach,
whether
pursued
before
a
court
or
an
agency.
the
contention
that
every
action
encompasses
only
civil
actions
or
judicial
actions
is
incorrect
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
broad
language
that
congress
used.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
structure,
in
that
it
renders
another
provision,
the
exception
for
administrative
offset,
totally
superfluous.
it
also
creates
an
irrationality
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
government's
claims.
finally,
it
robs
section
2415(a)
of
its
intended
effect.
turning
to
the
text,
congress
and
agencies
regularly
use
the
term
"action"
to
refer
to
adversary
adjudications
before
administrative
agencies
and
before
the
judiciary.
the
term--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--denotes--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
in
fact,
the...
it
refers
to
"administrative
proceedings
required
by
contract
or
law.
"
and
that
clause
applies
in
the
particular
circumstance
where
a
law
or
a
contract
requires
some
sort
of
administrative
proceeding
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
action
for
money
damages.
so,
if
you
can
bring
your
money-damages
action
without
any
prior
administrative
proceeding,
regardless
of
where
you
bring--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
nonadversarial
administrative
proceedings
would,
themselves,
not
be
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
they
also
wouldn't
be
money...
damages
actions.
so,
the
distinction
the
statute
draws
is
not
between
money-damages
actions
in
court
and
money...
damages
actions
before
agencies;
it's
before
money-damages
actions,
wherever
brought,
and
the
administrative
proceedings
that
have
to
be
brought
as
a
condition
precedent.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
correct.
that
is
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--for
historical
reasons,
the
denominations
are
quite
strange,
but
for
grisa,
quoted...
on
subsections
1702
and
1724,
quoted
on
pages
5
and
6
of
our
reply
brief,
specifically
state
that
the
order
to
pay
commences
the
proceedings.
and
so,
since
that
is
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
on
page
5-6
of
our
brief.
it's
section
1702
of
our--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--5
and
6
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
and
it's
13
u.s.c.
1724,
and
it
talks...
or
it
defines
the
"demand"
as
the
order
to
pay.
and
then,
the
definitional
provisions,
in
turn...
when
they're
talking
about
what
commences
the
action,
it
says
that
the
order
to
pay
"commences"
the
action.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--page
6
of
the
reply,
your
honor,
very
top.
the
citation
says
"13
u.s.c.
1724(b),
emphasis
added.
"
it
defines
"demand"
to
include
an
order
to
pay
issued
by
the
secretary.
and,
in
the
next
line
down,
we
say,
"for
grisa
thus
recognizes
that
the
so-call
order
to
pay,
far
from
concluding
the
action,
in
fact,
commences
it.
"
because
the
statute
of
limitations
prepared...
uses
the
word
"commenced"
to
describe
what
the
action...
the
order
to
pay
does.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
fact,
that
process,
which
isn't
even
mentioned
in
the
regulations,
doesn't
have
any
legal
operative
effect.
it's
more
like
a
demand
letter.
if
the
lessee
doesn't
respond
to
the
letter,
he
doesn't
waive
any
of
his
rights.
if
the
government
fails
to
include
a
claim
in
its
demand
letter,
in
the...
well,
in
the
audit
letter...
it
doesn't
waive
any
of
its
rights.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--first
document--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
in
fact,
there's
nothing
in
the
regulations...
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
would
concede...
that
actually
requires
this
informal
process.
it
happens
to
be
typically
done.
and
the
sg
uses
the
word
"typically"
in
the
brief.
but
there's
nothing
that
requires
it.
and
if
you
don't
respond,
there
are
no
consequences
to
failure
to
respond.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the...
anything
that
requires
the
secretary
to
proceed
by
order?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
the
secretary's
traditional
way
of
doing
things--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--oh,
but
it...
but
there
is
no
liability
if
the
order
fails
to
issue.
the
order,
if
it
were
the
first
salvo,
you
still
would
be
required
to
respond.
and
so,
your
failure
to
respond
is
very
much
a
default.
the
failure
to
respond
to
the
letter,
the
audit
letter,
has
no
legal
operative
effect--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct.
you
file
a--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
justice
scalia,
it
is
the
first
document,
which
is
recognized
in
the
regulations,
which
provides
the
lessor
of
the
notice
of
claims
against
it,
the
first
one
that's
required
by
the
regulations
in
order
to
commence
the
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
recognized--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
they
don't...
the
regulations
don't
require
this
informal
process.
it's
typically
done--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
that's
correct.
that
is
the
way
that
it
could
be
done.
there's
an
informal
process
that's
typically
followed;
but
you
could
ignore
it,
and
there's
no
legal
operative
effect.
so,
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--informal
process--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--can't
be
a
complaint.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
that
is
perhaps
why
the
agency
tries
this...
to
do
the
informal
process.
but,
in
fact,
it
does
not
have
legal
operative
effect.
there...
you
could
completely
ignore
that
initial
demand
letter,
and
say,
"sorry,
agency,
i'm
not
responding.
"
the
agency
then
files
its
order.
and
that's
the
first
time
you
must
register
your
defenses,
upon
failure
or
forfeiture--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
legal
consequences.
it's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
if
you
don't
respond
to
the
demand
letter,
there
are
no
legal
consequences.
if
you
don't
respond
to
the
letter
by
filing
what's
called
an
"appeal",
you
lose.
and
so,
it's
just
like
a
complaint;
you
default
if
you
fail
to
raise
your
defenses
at
that
point.
in
addition,
section
2415--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
we
don't
believe
a
demand
letter
would
toll
a
statute,
because
it's
not
required
by--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--by
law.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
i
certainly
hope--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--hope
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but,
in
fact,
section
2415(f),
which
is
on
page
4
and
5
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
makes
it
clear
that
whether
something
is
denominated
a
complaint
or
not
does
not
determine
whether
or
not
it's
covered
by
the
limitations
period.
2415(f)
is
an
exception
for
counterclaims
and
offsets
by
the
government
where
a
private
party
brings
an
action
against
the
government.
but
counterclaims
and
offsets
typically
aren't
brought
by
complaint;
they're
brought
in
the
answer,
they're
submitted
in
the
answer.
therefore,
whether
it's
denominated
an
2415
applies.
2415
applies
to
any
action
for
money
damages
founded
on
a
contract,
however
you
might
denominate
the
initial
filing
which
commences
the
proceedings.
in--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
starting
at
28
u.s.c.,
why
it's
there,
it,
in
fact,
applies
both
to
administrative
agency
actions
and
actions
in
courts.
and
sometimes
in
28
u.s.c.
there
are
provisions
that
apply
to
both.
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
for
example,
is
in
28
u.s.c.,
and
it
has
a
provision
for
administrative
adjustment
of
claims.
people
must
file
their
claims
before
an
agency
first,
and
then
the
agency
can
do
administrative
adjustment.
that's
entirely
separate
from
the
attorney
general's
ability
to
compromise
the
claim
once
it's
filed
in
court.
section...
title
5
also
contains
things
that
apply
to
courts
and
agencies...
the
right
to
judicial
review
of
agency
actions,
the
waiver
of
immunity
that's
necessary
for
those...
in
addition
to
standards
that
govern
judicial
review
of
agency
actions.
those
were
all
in
title
5,
but
they
actually
apply
to
courts.
these--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--oh,
no.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--actually
completely--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--superfluous.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
that's
in...
yes,
that's
in
title
28,
as
well.
and
with
respect
to
the
term
"defendants",
justice
ginsburg,
congress
has
often
used
the
term
"defendants"
even
in
the
context
of
administrative
actions.
the
stockyard
and
packers
act
of
1921...
it's
in
7
u.s.c.
210...
actually
talks
about
a
complaint
against
a
defendant
for
damages,
all
adjudicated
before
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
and
that
was
85
years
ago.
it
seems
a
little
late
in
the
day
now
to
debate
whether
one
can
be
a
defendant,
the
person
who
defends
before
an
agency,
as
well
as
the
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
you
can
talk
about
the
85
years
ago...
to
discuss
the
person
who
might
be
liable
for
damages
in--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--an
adversary--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
certainly
right.
these
are
all
things
that
would
apply,
we
would
expect,
both
to
a
civil
action
in
court
and
an
administrative-agency
action,
as
well.
they
may
work
better
for
one
or
the
other
in
different
particular
circumstances,
but
they
are
all
sufficiently
broad
that
they
can
be
used
in
both
circumstances.
and
the
one
the
government,
in
the
administrative
context,
would
be
most
interested
in
would
be
subsection
c.
when
the
government
just
doesn't
know
the
facts,
or
the
government
reasonably
couldn't
know
the
facts,
it
gets
an
exception,
just
tolling,
until
it
reasonably
could
have
known
of
the
fact.
and
that's
just
as
applicable
in
an
action
before
an
agency
as
it
would
be
in
an
action
before
a
court.
in
addition,
the
government's
contrary
construction
renders
an
entire
provision
superfluous.
and
that
is
the
one
that
justice
scalia
mentioned,
section
2415(i),
which
is
an
exception
for
administrative
offsets.
that
exception
for
administrative
offsets
would
do
no
work
at
all
if--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
that
was
added
about
16
years
later,
your
honor.
and
it
was
added,
but
it
clarifies
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and,
as
this
court
admitted
in...
pointed
out
in
cases
like
fausto
and
lafranca,
the
later
amendment
to
a
statute
can
clarify
its
meaning;
and,
indeed,
statutes
are
ordinarily
read,
once
amended,
as
if
they
existed
in
their
amended
form
from
the
offset.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
comptroller,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
exactly
right.
and
congress
resolved
that
debate
by
providing
an
exception
for
administrative
offsets,
and
no
other
exception
for
any--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--sort
of
administrative
proceeding.
and
that
raises
the
strong
inference
that,
in
fact,
this
applies
to
administrative
proceedings,
and
it
simply
doesn't
apply
to
administrative
offsets,
because
they're
an
exception.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
it
would
have--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
could
not
have
said
it
better,
and
i
will
not
attempt
to.
in
fact,
in
addition,
it
raises
another
anomaly
in
the
statute,
the
government's
contrary
construction.
and
that
is,
it
creates
sort
of
an
irrationality
in
the
hierarchy
of
claims
for
the
government.
offensive
judicial
actions
to
extract
money
from
private
individuals
must
be
brought
within
6
years.
administrative
offsets
for
the
government
to
try
and
avoid
paying
money,
those
must
be
brought
within
10
years,
under
the
administrative
offset
provision
that
was
enacted
together
with
the
exception
in
(i).
however,
offensive
administrative
actions
to
extract
money
may
be
brought
in
perpetuity,
forever.
it
simply
strains
credulity
to
believe
that
congress,
at
the
same
time
it
was
saying
the
government
has
only
10
years
to
assert
administrative
offsets
to
avoid
paying
money,
instead
intended
administrative
agencies
to
be
able
to
extract
money
on
that
very
same
claim--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
perpetuity.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
and
that's,
again,
going
back
to
fausto,
where
there
is
a
sensible
hierarchy
of
claims,
or
a
sensible
hierarchy
of
preferences.
the
court
doesn't
ordinarily
presume
that
congress
put
in
a
structure
that
doesn't
respect
that
ordinary
hierarchy.
and
the
government's
construction
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
ordinary
hierarchy
which
allows
the
government
to
avoid
making
payment
on
more
favorable
terms;
then
the
government
gets
to
go
in
and
forcibly
extract
money
from
private
individuals.
finally,
the
government's
construction
also
undermines
the
intended
effect
of
the
statute.
the
effect
of
statute...
the
purpose
of
statutes
of
limitations...
and
this
one,
in
particular...
is
to
provide
repose...
to
allow
the
individual
to
know
that
he
will
no
longer
confront
government
claims,
to
dispose
of
his
documents,
and
also
to
encourage
the
government
to
be
diligent
in
pursuing
its
claims.
none
of
those
purposes
are
achieved,
all
of
those
purposes
are
defeated,
if...
once
the
statute
of
limitations
period
expires--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
if
congress
had
decided
the
comptroller
general
is
right,
and
had
done
that
in
subsection
(i),
it
would
have
written
subsection
(i)
the
way
justice
scalia
proposed,
which
is
to
say
this
doesn't
apply
to
administrative
claims
at
all.
what
it
did
is,
it
said,
"ooh,
this
appears
to
apply
to
administrative
claims
and
the
comptroller
thinks
these
administrative
offsets
are
important,
so
we
will
give
a
special
statute
of
limitations
period
in
31
u.s.c.
for
those,
and
exempt
them
from
the
more
general
statute
of
limitations
period
in
section
28
u.s.c.
2415.
"
so,
i
don't
believe
that
it
should
be
read
that
way.
is
it
frivolous
to
suggest
that
that's
the
reading?
no,
the
government--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--got
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
indeed,
the
legislative
history
mentions...
and
there
is
a
battle
of
letters
between--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
office
of
legal
counsel
and
the
comptroller
on
this
issue.
and
congress
actually
stepped
into
the
fray
and
created
an
exception.
but
it
created
a
limited
exception--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--an
exception
that
applies
only
to
one
context,
and
that's
administrative
offsets.
and
that
certainly
raises
a
very
strong
inference
that,
where
there
isn't
such
an
exception,
the
statute
applies
to
administrative
proceedings,
more
generally.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
i
have
a
hard
time
psychoanalyzing
congress,
because
it's
sort
of
a
corporate
body,
and
i
can't
tell
what
member
of
congress
is
saying
what.
but
when
the
court
of
these
statutes,
it
generally
reads
them...
and
it,
in
fact,
avoids,
whenever
possible,
superfluity.
and
if
this
provision
applies
to
administrative
proceedings
from
the
outset,
subsection
(i)
is
superfluous,
it's...
does
no
work
whatsoever.
and
so,
the...
when
congress
amended
this
statute,
it
certainly
clarified
that,
where
there
is
no
exception,
this
statute
applies
to
actions
filed
in
administrative
proceedings.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
will
endeavor
not
to.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
wanted
to
start
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
"action".
i
was
somewhat
bemused
by
the
government's
insistence
that
had...
the
term
"action"
in
west
versus
gibson
was
construed...
it
must
mean
an
action
before
a
court,
and
has
that
as
its
ordinary
meaning.
the
solicitor
general's
own
position
in
west
versus
gibson,
on
page
25
and
6
of
its
brief
was,
"section
1981(a)
does
not,
however,
define
the
term
"action"
as
being
limited
to
judicial
proceedings.
"
"the
statutory
language,
read
in
context,
suggests
that
no
such
limitation
was
intended.
"
page
6
of
the
government's
reply,
"the
term
1981,
can
reasonably
be
construed
as
encompassing
both
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings.
"
the
term
"action"
is
a
term
that's
used
for
adversary
adjudicative
proceedings,
whether
those
are
in
court
or
before
an
agency.
it
is
not
limited
to
administrative
agency
proceedings,
as
the
government
itself
recognized
in
west
versus
gibson.
there
are
more
general
terms
here.
there's
also
"complaint",
there's
also
"defendant".
there's
a
number
of
those.
but
those
general
terms
are
also
the
terms
of
adversary
adjudication.
and
congress
uses
them,
as
far
back
as
1921,
for
adversary
adjudications
before
agencies.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
fact...
no.
but
the...
the
answer
is
that
we
didn't...
no
issue
was
engaged
as
to
what
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
complaint
below.
that
raised...
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
solicitor
general
in
its
merits
brief,
saying,
"no,
no,
no,
there's
actually
some
stuff
that
comes
before
the
order.
"
but
if...
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
look
at
the
definitions
in
fogrsfa,
1724
and
1702(a),
which
tell
you
what,
under...
in
congress's
view,
commences
the
proceedings
here.
and,
in
congress's
view,
what
commences
the
proceedings,
what
triggers
the
new
statute
of
limitations
and
stops
it
from
running,
is
the
order
to
pay,
which
congress
defines
as
a
"demand".
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--actually,
justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
certainly
has
a
hybrid
quality,
justice
scalia.
and
it's
not
a
hybrid
quality
that
the
industry
particularly
likes.
but
it
is
the
first
time
that
the
government
asserts
its
state...
its
claims
as
to
what's
wrong,
in
a
binding
legally
operative
document,
where
the
failure
to
respond
results
in
default.
it
has
that
function
as
complaint.
it
is
the
first
salvo
in
official,
formal
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
language
that
has
been
used,
and...
as
a
result
of
very
odd
historical
anomalies
and
attempts
to
introduce
a
sense
of
due
process
to
these
proceedings
over
time...
is
odd,
and
it
is
awkward.
but
it's
clear
that
when
congress
wrote
the
scope
of
this
statute,
it
said
it
applies
to
"every
action
for
money
damages
by
the
government
which
is
founded
in
contract.
"
it
doesn't
say
"actions
that
are
begun
by
complaint.
"
now,
the
complaint
is
what
congress
assumes
will
stop
the
provision
from
running.
and
there
is
always,
in
an
adversary
adjudication,
some
document
that
functions
like
a
complaint,
that
provides
the
defendant
the
notice
of
what
the
claims
are
against
it,
and
to
which
failure
to
respond
will
result
in
default.
we
believe
that
the
most
likely
thing
to
be
the
complaint
here
is,
the
thing
that
provided
us
with
notice,
is
that...
"boys,
you've
got
to
respond;
otherwise,
you're
in
trouble.
"
--was
the
order
to
pay.
and
congress
came
to
that
same
conclusion
when
it
enacted...
when
it
enacted
fogrsfa
and
established
a
7-year
statute
of
limitations
provision.
but
if
we
lose
2
years
of
the
claim,
and
only
get
1
because
it
is
the
agency
letter,
in
the
court's
view,
well,
that's
fine,
but
there's
some
document
here
that
started
these
agency
proceedings,
and
it
is
that
document
which
is
a
complaint.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
i...
that's
true.
and
in
terms
of
the
olc
letter,
we
offered
to
lodge
it
in
our
brief.
unfortunately,
by
the
court's
rules,
we're
not
allowed
to
lodge
it,
unless
the
court
specifically
requests
it.
and
so,
that's
why
it's
not
there.
but
we
will
get
that
to
you,
or
the
government
will
get
it
to
you,
as
soon
as
possible.
the
actual
agency
letter,
in
this
case,
isn't
in
the
administrative
record.
and
it
turns
out
that
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
it,
and
the
government
hasn't
been
able
to
find
it.
and
so,
it's
a
letter.
it's
a
demand
letter,
but
it
is
a
letter,
and
that...
the
order
to
pay
is
actually
the
opening
salvo
in
these
proceedings.
and
again,
what
opens
the
proceedings
in...
the
justice
department
regulations
and
other
regulations--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
try
to
define--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
yes.
of
course.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
it
may
have
to
be
from
some
other
proceeding;
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
from
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
it
would
be
all
leases
on
indian
lands.
it
would
be
all
leases
which
involve
minerals
other
than
oil
and
gas,
whether
it
be
coal,
gold,
silver,
anything
like
that.
it
would
also
be
all
claims
before
september...
all
production
before
september
of
1996.
that
introduces
something
of
an
oddity,
if
one
accepts
the
government's
position.
it
would
be
that,
for
all
claims
going
forward
from
september
of
1996,
the
government
has
7
years,
but,
for
the
prior
200
years,
those
claims
persist
in
perpetuity.
when
section
2415(a)
itself
was
enacted,
congress
avoided
precisely
that
result
by
deeming
all
prior
claims
to
have
accrued
on
the
date
the
statute
of
limitations
was
enacted.
and
the
very
fact
that
congress
didn't
do
that
here
is
evidence
that
congress...
to
the
extent
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all...
is
evidence
that
congress,
in
fact,
understood
that
there
already
was
a
statute
of
limitations
applicable.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
also--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
there
are...
there
are
some
contexts
in
which
there
already
is
a
separate
administrative
regime
which
would
have
its
own
statute
of
limitations.
the
contract
disputes
act,
as
the
government
points
out,
is
one
of
those.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
because
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--contract
disputes--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--act
has
an
exception
at
the
front
and
says
2415>
["].
it's
its
own
animal
to
itself.
and
there
is
a
clause
at
the
front
of
2415
that
says
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
congress.
"
and
so,
congress
often
takes
exceptions.
and
when
it
modified
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1996,
that
was
an
exception
to
the
2415
regime.
so,
congress
knows
how
to
conduct
specialized
situations
and
take
things
outside
of
2415
when
it
needs
to.
but
it
enacted
section
2415
as
a
catchall
for
all
of
those
situations
where
congress
hadn't
managed
to
anticipate
the
circumstances.
and
the
government's
premise
of
the
whole
provision
is
that
congress
botched
it.
congress
provided
a
catchall
that
catches
judicial
actions,
but
leaves
the
government
free,
in
perpetuity,
to
persist...
to
proceed
on
precisely
the
same
claims
for
precisely
the
same
relief,
plus
interest.
and,
because
interest
is
calculated
at
a
relatively
high
rate,
that
makes
those
old
claims
much,
much
more
valuable
than
the
relatively
more
recent
claims.
and
it
seems
implausible
to
think
that
congress
enacted
a
catchall
limitations
period
with
a
loophole
so
large
that
it
deprives
the
statute
of
limitations
period
of
effect
almost
entirely.
finally,
i'd
like
to
say,
one
moment
about
the
statute...
the
canon
of
strict
construction.
and
that
is
that
it
doesn't
always
require
the
court
to
narrow
otherwise
broad
statutory
language,
particularly
where
doing
so
would
have
the
effect
of
rendering
another
provision...
here,
subsection
(i)
is
superfluous...
introducing
anomalies
into
the
statutory
structure
and
depriving
the
statute
of
its
intended
effect,
as
the
bowers
case
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
16
makes
clear.
and
bowers
case
was
virtually
on
point.
it
was
the
case
where
the...
it
was
a
statute
of
limitations
that
could
have
applied
to
administrative
agency
actions,
or
it
could
not
have.
and
the
court
declined
to
accept
a
narrowing
construction
proffered
by
the
government
under
statute
of
strict
construction
because
it
would
have
rendered
one
of
the
provisions...
one
for
consent
proceedings...
superfluous,
because
it
would
have
resulted
in
anomaly,
and
because
it
would
have
undermined
the
premise
of
repose
which
undergirded
the
statute
of
limitations
in
that
case.
precisely
the
same
things
are
true
here.
and,
for
those
reasons,
the
court
should
reach
precisely
the
same
result.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
