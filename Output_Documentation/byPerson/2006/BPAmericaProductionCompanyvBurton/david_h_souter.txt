what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
you,
on
that
point...
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
and
i've
looked
at
your
authority,
but,
right
in
the
provision
itself,
there
is
a
verbal
distinction
made
between
actions
for
money
damages,
and
what,
at
the
end
of
the
provision,
they
refer
to
as
1-year
supplementary
rule.
doesn't
the
statute,
in
effect,
say,
"we
don't
mean,
by
"action",
what
we
would
possibly...
what
possibly
might
be
included
as
an
administrative
proceeding?
"
if
they
had
wanted
an
administrative
proceeding
to
be
a
subset
of
the
actions
for
money
damages,
wouldn't
it
have
been
sensible
for
congress
to
say
in...
to
refer,
instead
of
to
"administrative
proceedings",
to
"administrative
actions"?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
regulations
don't
refer
to
the
initial
letter?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
they
literally
could
start,
absolutely
out
of
the
blue,
by
issuing
the
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
on
that
theory,
then,
there
was...
there
was
no
time
issue
with
respect
to
the
right
to
offset,
then,
in
the
olc's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your...
in
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
said
what
was
essential
to
the...
to
olc's
position
was
that
the
offset
is
like
a
prejudgment
attachment,
and,
in
effect,
it's
an
attachment
without
process.
if
that's
the
case,
then
timing
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
conversely,
as
justice
scalia
said,
if
timing
does
have
something
to
do
with
it,
timing
presumably
derives
from
this
provision;
this
provision,
therefore,
must
have
been
assumed
to
apply
to
administrative
proceedings.
so,
either
there's
no
time
question
with
respect
to
the
offsets,
or,
if
there
is
a
time
question
with
respect
to
the
offsets,
it
implies
an
olc
position
that
this
provision
applies
to
administrative
proceedings.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
wrong
with
that
logic?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
put
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
good
company,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
if
it
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
prejudgment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
was
a
prejudgment
attachment
in
aid
of
what
could
be
accomplished
administratively
by,
ultimately,
an
administrative
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
the...
at
the
time
that
4515...
is
that
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--20--
i'm
sorry.
at
the
time
that
was
enacted,
were
there
any
limitations
in
other
statutes
on
the
commencement
of
administrative
proceedings?
