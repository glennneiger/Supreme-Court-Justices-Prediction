justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
point
has
to
be
that
there
are
administrative
proceedings
that
are
not
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
contend
that
what
commenced
the
action
here
was
the
order
demanding
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
weird
commencement
of
an
action,
where
what
then
follows
is
what
is
referred
to
as
an
"appeal",
within
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page
of
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
reply.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
finding
it.
where
is
it,
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is...
why
doesn't
it
make
much
more
sense...
as
i
understand
the
proceeding,
this
order
doesn't
come
out
of
the
blue.
as
required,
there
has
to
be
a
letter
to
the...
to
the
payee
saying,
"we
think...
we
think
you
owe
so
much
money.
"
he
is
allowed
to
respond,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then,
after
considering
the
response,
the
order
issues.
now,
i
would
consider
that
a...
you
know,
an...
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
complaint
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
it.
and
then,
finally,
the
first
decision
of
the
agency,
which
is
then
appealed...
and
cfr
provides
for
an...
what
he
calls
an
appeal.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
final
opinion
of
the
agency
is
the
opinion
on
the
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--waive
it,
but
it
can't
issue
the
order
without
having
issued
the
letter
first,
giving--
justice
antonin
scalia
--giving
the
party
an
opportunity
to
say
why
this
amount
isn't
owed.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
that
requires
the
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you
could
say
the
same
for
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
you
don't...
but
you
don't
respond
to
the
order;
you
take
an
appeal
from
the
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
crazy
to
call
that
order
a
complaint.
i...
even
if
i
grant
your
other
argument,
that
an
administrative
proceeding
can
be
commenced
by
a
complaint...
or
that
the
term
"complaint"
can
apply
to
administrative
proceedings,
i
don't
think
that
what
you've
hung
your
hat
on
here...
namely,
the
order...
seems
to
me
to
fit
that
description.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
doubt
whether
that
would
conform
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
mean,
either...
even
at
the
first
level
of
agency
decision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
give
the
individual
an
opportunity
to
reply.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
can
ignore
it.
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
you
could
ignore
an
agency
complaint,
too--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
a
formal
complaint,
in
which
case
you'll
be
found
liable.
what
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fact
that
you
don't
have
to
respond
have
to
do
with
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
win
in
this
case
even
if
it
did.
i
don't
think
that
the
difference
between
the
initial
letter
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
reply,
and
the...
what
you
call
the
"complaint",
the
order...
that
time
period
doesn't
put
you
out
of...
out
of
the
permissible
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
2415(a),
(i),
we...
you,
you
cannot
possibly
say
that
that
only
applies
to
judicial
actions,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
in
title
28.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
could
have
said...
if
the
other
interpretation
of
2415(a),
as
not
applying
to
administrative
proceedings,
were
correct,
they
could
have
said
the
provisions
of
this
section
do
not
apply
to
administrative
proceedings--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
would
have...
which
would
have
handled
the
offset--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
would
have
been
well
beyond
the
offset.
and
the
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they
only
focus
on
the
offset
certainly
suggests
that
when
you're
not
talking
about
offset,
it
does
apply
to
administrative
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
believe
that
they
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can...
i
can
believe
that
they
do
that.
[laughter]
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
mistake.
but
i
would
not
assume
a
mistake
unless
it's
very
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
often
does.
but
it
does
not,
universally.
and
there
are
a
number
of
instances
cited
by
the
petitioner
that...
where
this
court
and...
and
statutes
use
the
term
in
context
where
it
clearly
applies
to
administrative
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
question
is,
how...
you
know,
how
absurd
is
it
not
to
read
it
to
apply
to
administrative
proceedings
in
this
case?
and
i
find
it
pretty
absurd,
because
you
assume,
if
you
read
that
it
way,
that
there
is
effectively
no
statute
of
limitations
whatever
for
the
government
in
these
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
and
this
was
the
congress
that
enacted
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
late
as
1978,
the
justice
department
didn't
think
that
way,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
opinion
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel,
in
'78,
was
exactly
what
the
petitioner
here
would
urge.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
excuse
me...
how
could
olc
possibly
think
that
it
applied
to
administrative
offsets
if
it
didn't
apply
to
administrative
proceedings?
i
mean,
it
was
a
contradiction
of
the
proposition,
which
you're
urging
here,
which
is
that
this
statute
applies
only
to
judicial
proceedings.
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
whether
they
spoke
just
to
offsets
or
not,
the
position
taken
by
the
justice
department
was
that
this
statute
relates
to
administrative
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
opinion,
by
the
way?
both
sides
cited
it.
the...
is
it...
it
was
unpublished.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
anybody
give
it
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
know
they
did
offer,
but
nobody
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
i
would
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
the
initial
letter
that,
in
the
agency
practice,
precedes
the
order?
i
gather
there's
a
letter
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
an
issue
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
--sounds
to
me
like
a
complaint,
a
response--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
an
adjudication.
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"we
think
you
owe
this".
justice
antonin
scalia
the
response
comes
back,
"i
don't
think
we
owe
it,
and
here's
why.
"
and
then
there's
a
ruling,
"you
do
owe
it".
and
that's
the
order.
and
then
you
can
appeal
it.
and
the
cfr
refers
to
it
as
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assert
that
there's
a
discrepancy?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
an
example
of
issue
letters
anywhere?
that's
not
in
the
materials
either,
is
it?
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
i
tried
to
figure
that
out.
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
defend
against
a
claim
for,
you
know,
stuff
that
went
on
a
hundred
years
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i'm
really
very
reluctant
to...
unless
there
is
no
possible
other
reading
of
the
statute,
to
think
that
that's...
that
that's
what
the
law
provides,
that
the
government
can
show
up
a
hundred
years
later,
and
say,
"oh,
by
the
way,
you
owe
all
this
money.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
the
company
says
"gee,
i...
you
know,
i
don't
have
records
from
a
hundred
years
ago.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
say
that
again.
until
1966,
there
were
no
statute
of
limitations
against
any
government
suits?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
apply
against
the
government
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
another
indication.
why
would
you
allow
them
to
destroy
those
records
after
6
years
if
you...
if
you
thought...
if
you
thought
that
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
to
claims
for
these
things?
i
mean,
that's
just
another
inconsistency
that...
in
the
statutory
scheme
that's
created.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
"you
can
destroy
your
records
after
6
years.
"
well,
why?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
when
you...
when
you
say
2415(a)
and
you
leave
out
(i),
which...
or
i
guess
it's
"one".
is
it?
little...
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
(i).
i
mean,
that
clearly
does
apply
to
administrative
proceedings.
and
i
could
understand
the
argument
that
congress
was
just
making
things
doubly
clear...
okay
+/?
that
(a)
does
not
apply
to
administrative
proceedings.
i
could
understand
that
argument
if
the
way
(i)
was
written
is,
"the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
administrative
proceedings.
"
and
then
i
would
say,
"you
know,
oh,
well,
that
was
always
the
case,
and
this
is
just
making
it
clear.
"
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that...
the
only
administrative
proceeding
that
they
cut
out
of
it
is
these
offsets.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
you
know,
the
normal
rule
is
inclusio
unius,
exclusio
alterius.
i
would...
it
means,
to
me,
when
i
read
the
statute
as
a
whole...
and
that's
the
way
i
read
statutes,
i
don't
ask
whether
this
section
was
adopted
this
year,
and
the
other
section
was
adopted
next
year...
i
don't
do
it
bite
by
bite;
you
look
at
the
whole
text...
and,
when
you
read
all
this
stuff
together,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
import
of
(i)
is
that
administrative
proceedings,
despite
the
fact
that
"action"
is
not
a
very
common
word
to
use
for
them,
are
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
best
thing
you
have
going
for
you,
really,
the
strict
construction
canon.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
didn't
think
the
order
was
a
complaint,
but
i
thought
the
initial
letter
was
a
complaint?
would
the
petitioner
lose?
because
they
never
made
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
have
an
administrative
proceeding
which
is
called
a
"complaint"?
you
know,
i
mean...
and
some
are,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
not
be
covered
by
2415(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
and
let's
assume
all
those
terms
are
used
in
the
agency
procedure.
they're
talking
about
"action",
"right
of
action".
all
those
terms
are
used
in
the
agency's
procedural
rules.
would
they
then
come
under
this
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
have
to
say
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because,
otherwise,
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency,
just
by
renaming
their
things,
to--
come
in
or
out,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true.
that's
true.
but
the
provision
you're
arguing
that
you
come
under
does
talk
about
a
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what...
you
know,
that's
what
starts
the
6
years
running.
and
it's...
seems
to
me
odd
to
call
something
a
"complaint"
which
is,
in
fact,
an
order.
they're
not
complaining
about
anything;
they're
saying,
"pay
the
money".
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
usually
a
complaint,
you're...
you
make
your
point,
and
say,
"what
do
you
say?
"
"what's
your
answer?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
an
order.
you're...
boom,
"pay".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
only
true
if
you
consider
an
appeal
to
be
the
response.
and
that's
rather
weird,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
response
to
a
complaint
is
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
get
us...
we're
going
to
have
supplemental
material
filed,
the
olc
opinion.
could
you...
could
you
get
us
a...
you
know,
a
sample
of
an
agency
letter?
or,
if
you
can't,
maybe
the
government
can?
justice
antonin
scalia
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
other
areas
would
we
be
messing
up
by
finding
for
you?
i
mean,
here,
you
know,
if
we
don't
find
that
this
administrative
action
is
covered
by
this
statute
of
limitations,
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
but
there
may...
there
are
other...
may
be
other
areas
covered
by
this
text...
namely,
a
suit
by
the
united
states...
founded
upon
any
contract
expressly
or
implied
in
law
or
in
fact,
where
there
is
some
kind
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
prevail
over
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it's
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--specific.
