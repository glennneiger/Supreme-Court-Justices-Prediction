mr.
lamken,
the
point
has
been
made
that
there
are
many
indications
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
ordinary
civil
action
in
a
court.
in
addition
to
finding
this
provision
solely
in
title
28,
the
judiciary
code,
and
not
in
title
5,
there's
also,
if
you
read
the
following
provision,
2416,
time
for
commencing
actions
brought
by
the
united
states.
and
then
it
tells
us
the
tolling
periods.
and,
in
doing
that,
it
refers
twice
to
the
"defendant",
which
is
a
term
that's
used
in
civil
proceedings,
not
administrative
proceedings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
the
typical
term
used
in
agency
proceedings
to
designate
the
responding
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
content--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
content
of
the
tolling
provision,
as
well,
seems
geared...
seems
geared
to
a
civil
lawsuit.
it
talks
about
a
person
being
outside
the
united
states;
therefore,
they
wouldn't
be
amenable
to
service
of
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
part
of
the
original
statute,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
(i)
was
added
because
it's...
for
a
very
specific
reason,
that
there
was
a
debate
between
the
department
of
justice
and...
i
forgot
the
other
agency--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes...
about
whether
an
offset
would
be
subject
to
the
time
limit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
there's
no
limit
at
all,
and
you
concede
that
that's
the
case.
so,
the
government
could
go
back
on
these
royalties
as
long
as
it
likes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
made
the
point
that
the
issue
letter
is
just
raising
the
issues,
and
it's
not
charging,
as
a
complaint
would
allege,
"you
owe
us",
but
this
is,
"maybe
you
owe
us".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
position
is,
this
would
apply
to
the
universe
of
administrative
proceedings.
now,
this
particular
lease
arrangement
is
taken
care
of
by
an
express
statute
of
limitations.
so,
what
we're
talking
about,
for
the
future...
what
would
change
under
your
interpretation?
not
gas
leases,
because...
there's
a
7-year
limitation
for
both
administrative
orders
to
pay
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--court
actions.
