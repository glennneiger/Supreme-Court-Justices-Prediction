justice

isn't
the
most
likely
answer
that
they
just...
they
saw
a
small
problem,
and
they
rendered
a
decision
on
the
small
problem,
and
they
didn't
think
about
it
any
further
than
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
going
forward,
if
we--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
we
agree
with
your
position,
the
result
will
be
that
there
will
be
a
7-year
limitations
period
for
oil
and
gas
leases,
but,
for
indian
claims
and
for
minerals,
there'll
be
no
statute
of
limitations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
they--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--when
they
enacted
the
7-year
limitation
period,
did
they
explain
why
they
would
treat
those
two
situations
so
differently?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
this
doesn't
apply
to
any
administrative
proceeding,
or
just
those
that
are
structured
like
this
one,
where
you
don't
have
anything
that's
labeled
a
"complaint"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
for
the
district
of
columbia’s
circuit.
contract
actions
brought
by
the
united
state’s
government
are
generally
subject
to
the
six
years
statute
of
limitations
setout
in
28
u.s.c
section
2415(a).
the
question
in
today’s
case
is
whether
administrative
payment
orders
issued
by
the
department
of
the
interiors,
minerals
management
service
assessing
royalty
underpayment
on
oil
and
gas
leases
followed
in
that
statute,
we
hold
that
section
2415(a)
does
not
apply
to
these
administrative
payment
orders,
and
we
therefore
affirm.
section
2415(a)
provides
that
“every
action
for
money
damages
brought
by
the
united
states
shall
be
barred
unless
the
complaint
is
filed
within
six
years.”
as
ordinarily
understood
the
key
terms
in
the
statute
action
and
complaint
principally
concerned
judicial
not
administrative
proceedings.
section
2415(a)
in
fact
expressly
distinguished
between
judicial
and
administrative
proceedings
providing
that
an
action
must
commence
“within
one
year
after
final
decisions
have
been
rendered
in
applicable
administrative
proceedings.”
to
the
extent
that
any
doubt
exists
as
to
the
appropriate
understanding
of
the
scope
of
section
2415(a)
it
is
erased
by
the
rule
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
construed
narrowly
against
the
government.
petitioners
argue
the
reading
of
section
2415(a)
so
as
not
to
apply
to
administrative
payments
orders
renders
subsection
‘i’
of
the
same
statute
superfluous.
section
2415(i)
provides
that
nothing
in
section
2415
shall
prevent
united
states
from
collecting
any
claim
by
means
of
an
administrative
offset,
under
the
reading
the
court
adopts
today
this
provision
is
not
redundant
before
section
2415(a)
was
enacted
administrative
offsets
have
been
understood
by
the
department
of
justice
as
a
form
of
prejudgment
attachment
device
attendant
to
a
judicial
action.
section
2415(i)
makes
clear
that
even
when
viewed
in
this
manner,
administrative
offsets
remain
available
to
agencies.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
affirmed,
this
opinion
is
unanimous.
chief
justice
roberts
and
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
disposition
of
this
case.
