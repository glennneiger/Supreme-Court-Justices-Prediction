mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
public
school
officials
to
stand
aside
and
permit
students
who
are
entrusted
to
their
supervision
and
care
to
promote
or
encourage
the
use
of
illegal
drugs.
as
this
court
observed
in
earls,
the
nationwide
drug...
drug
epidemic
makes
the
war
against
drugs
a
pressing
concern
in
every
school.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
need
not
decide
anything
more
broadly
than
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
this
is
a
manifestation
of
the
principle
articulated
in
earls
and
repeated
in
hazelwood
that
a,
school
does
not
have
to
tolerate
a
message
that
is
inconsistent
with
its
basic
educational--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
why
i
think
there
would,
there
would
be,
it
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
for
the
court
to
articulate
a
rule
that
had
to
do
with
encouraging
illegal
conduct
and
particularly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well...
i
think,
i
think
a
school
could
certainly
prohibit
the
display
of
banners
on
a
school
trip
or
in
a
school
assembly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
that
may
well...
that
may
well
be
different.
and
that's
why
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
do
not.
i
think...
i
think
the
point
that
you
make
that
a
principal
sees
the
banner
across
the
street
and
sees
the
word
bong
hits,
and...
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
olympic
torch
was
about
to
arrive,
i
think
it
was.
she
made
a
quick
judgment
and
an
entirely
reasonable
one
that
the
display
of
the
slang
words
bong
hits--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no.
and...
and,
and
just
to
finish,
in
tinker
even
with
a
viewpoint
concern,
the
court
said
if
you
could
show
material
disruption,
and...
and
the
court
made
that
clear
in
tinker,
by,
by
its
comparison
to
several
lower
court
decisions
where
wearing
buttons
had
been
prohibited
because
they
had
caused
disruption.
and
the
third
category
in
tinker
itself
was
where
there
would
be
an
intrusion
upon
the
rights
of
other
students
to
be
secure
and
be
let
alone.
that's
tinker
dealing
with
political
speech.
but
in
frazier
and
hazelwood
the
court
identified
additional
categories
of
speech
that
could
be
governed
by
the
school,
and
this
is
in
footnote
4
of
hazelwood.
the
court
made
clear
that
the
ability
to
regulate
those
categories
of
speech
goes
beyond
the
question
of
whether
there
would
be
disruption
or
whether
there
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think...
i
think
if,
if
the
button
is
legalize
marijuana
during
a
referendum
in
the
state,
then
that,
that
might
be
the
category
of
political
speech
that
could
not
be
regulated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but...
but
the,
what
was
happening
was
a
sign
that
was
reasonably
construed
to
encourage
the
use
of
illegal
drugs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i...
i
think
in,
in
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
public
schools,
this
court
has,
has
a
consistent
theme
as
to
give
deference
to
the
judgments
by
the
educators.
public
schools--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
the
question
is
what
mr.
frederick
intended.
the
question
is
what
a
reasonable
observer
would
think.
and
the
words
"bong
hits"
are
slang
that
would
be
particularly,
have
a
particular
characteristic
of
getting
across
to
other
student,
and
they
suggest
a
casual
tolerance
and
encouragement
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i,
i
think
that
would
be
a
judgment
call.
i
think
the,
i
think
the
casual
use--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
judgment
and
this
is,
this
is
reflected
in
frazier.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
ultimately
it's
a
question
of
law,
whether
it's
a
reasonable
judgment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i...
i
mean,
i
think
for
this
reason.
this
was
essentially
an
outdoor
assembly,
where
the...
whether
the
students
were
assembled
to
watch
a
particular
different,
just
as
in
an
indoor
assembly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
again,
that's
why
i
don't
think
there's
any
one
single
rule
that
governs
all
cases.
this,
this
i
think
falls
under
the
frazier
standard,
where
the
court
said
that,
that
schools
have
a
duty
to
inculcate
matters
of
civility
and
to
prepare
students
for
citizenship,
and
not
violating
the
law
is
an
important
part
of
that
and
teachers'
act
in
loco
parentis.
they
act
as
guardians
and
they
should
be
able
to
do,
as
this
court
says
in
earls,
what
a
reasonable
guardian
would
do.
that
would
mean
don't
allow
people
to
encourage
lawbreaking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
students'
present
at
the
event,
presence
as
the
event,
was
like
an
assembly.
students
may
go
into
an
assembly
hall
and
not
have
to
sit
with
their
class.
they
were
released
from
class,
but
they
were
not
released
from
school
or
school
supervision.
there
were
teachers
around
there
and
the
school
could
define
what
is
the
nature
of
our
assembly
at
this
public
event
and,
just
as
in,
in
the
auditorium
a
school
could
say
there
will
be
no
political
banners
or,
frankly,
no
banners
about
anything
other
than
what
the
event
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
were
not
allowed
to
go
home.
they
were
required,
they
were
required--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
were
required
to
be
there
if
the
classroom
teacher
decided
to
let
them
go
out
there,
but
they
were
under
school
supervision
at
that
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
may,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
he
knew
in
advance
that
this
was
about
the
olympics.
that's
why
he
made
the
sign.
and
they
were
released
to
go
out
and
watch
the
torch
go
by.
he
hasn't
raised
any
question
of
notice
or
due
process
concerns.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
