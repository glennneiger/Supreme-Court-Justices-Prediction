the
court
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-278,
morse
vs.
frederick.
mr.
starr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
problem...
the
problem,
mr.
starr,
is
that
school
boards
these
days
take
it
upon
themselves
to
broaden
their
mission
well
beyond
education
or
protection
from
illegal
substances,
and
several
of
the
briefs
have
pointed
out
school
boards
have
adopted
policies
taking
on
the
whole
range
of
political
issues.
now,
do
they
get
to
dictate
the
content
of
speech
on
all
of
those
issues
simply
because
they
have
adopted
that
as
the
part
of
their
educational
mission?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
you're
right
about
that,
and
i
guess
my
question
goes
to
how
broadly
we
should
read
tinker.
i
mean,
why
is
it
that
the
classroom
ought
to
be
a
forum
for
political
debate
simply
because
the
students
want
to
put
that
on
their
agenda?
presumably
the
teacher's
agenda
is
a
little
bit
different
and
includes
things
like
teaching
shakespeare
or
the
pythagorean
theorem,
and
just
because
political
speech
is
on
the
student's
agenda,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
sense
to
read
tinker
so
broadly
as
to
include
protection
of
those,
that
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
you
think
that
the,
not
a
15
foot
banner
but
a
very
discrete
button
that
says
"legalize
marijuana",
although
it
might
be
covered
as
not
being
disruptive
under
tinker,
it
could
be
inconsistent
with
the
school's
mission
and
prohibited
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mertz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
case
about
money.
your
client
wants
money
from
the
principal
personally
for
her
actions
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
a
broader
issue
of
whether
principals
and
teachers
around
the
country
have
to
fear
that
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
out
of
their
personal
pocket
whenever
they
take
actions
pursuant
to
established
board
policies
that
they
think
are
necessary
to
promote
the
school's
educational
mission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
think
it
was
clearly
established
that
she
had
to
allow
a
student
at
a
school-supervised
function
to
hold
a
15-foot
banner
saying
4
jesus>
["]?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
can't
the
school
decide
that
it's
part
of
its
mission
to
try
to
prevent
its
student
from
engaging
in
drug
use
and
so
that
it's
going
to
have
a
viewpoint
on
drug
use
and
that
viewpoint
is
going
to
be
that
it's
opposed
to
it
and
so
that
it
takes
a
particular
view
with
respect
to
signs
that
in
their
view
seem
to
encourage
drug
use?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
would
be
different
if
this
were
in
the
student
gym
and
they
were
having
a
discussion.
there
was
a
program
to
discourage
drug
use
and
he
held
up
his
sign;
you
would
say
it
would
be
all
right
to
take
down
the
sign
inside
the
school
gym?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
matter
that
this
is
outside.
it
matters
on
the
content
of
the
sign,
not
the
location?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
a
political...
even
assuming
it's
a
political
issue,
the
question
is
whether
the
school
has
to
say
our
classrooms,
our
field
trips,
our
sponsored
and
supervised
activities
are
a
forum
for
that
debate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
disruption
does
not
include
undermining
the
message
they
want
to
send?
it
has
to
be
some
type
of
physical
disruption.
but
undermining
the
message
they
want
to
send,
they
can't
make
the
judgment
that
that's
not
allowed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
school
have
to
be
completely
neutral
in
that
respect?
does
it
have
to
punish
who
says
that
was
a
good
program,
i'm
not
going
to
use
drugs,
and
you
shouldn't
either,
because
he's
taking
position
on
a
public
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
that
notion
that
our
schools
have
to
be
content
neutral...
i
thought
we
wanted
our
schools
to
teach
something,
including
something
besides
just
basic
elements,
including
the
character
formation
and
not
to
use
drugs.
they
have
to
be
neutral
on
whether
you
should
use
drugs
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
he
go
where
he
went?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
he
choose
that
location
to
unfurl
his
banner?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
we
get
back...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
we
get
back
to
what
the
case
is
about.
you
think
the
law
was
so
clearly
established
when
this
happened
that
the
principal,
that
the
instant
that
the
banner
was
unfurled,
snowballs
are
flying
around,
the
torch
is
coming,
should
have
said
oh,
i
remember
under
tinker
i
can
only
take
the
sign
down
if
it's
disruptive.
but
then
under
frazier
i
can
do
something
if
it
interferes
with
the
basic
mission,
and
under
kuhlmeier
i've
got
this
other
thing.
so
she
should
have
known
at
that
point
that
she
could
not
take
the
banner
down,
and
it
was
so
clear
that
she
should
have
to
pay
out
of
her
own
pocket
because
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
it
should
be
perfectly
clear
to
her
exactly
what
she
could
and
couldn't
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
gets
back
to
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier.
he
came
here
because
it
was
the
school
event,
the
school
sponsored
activity.
he
could
have
gone
anywhere
along
the
route.
he
knew
that
it
was
coming
by
the
school,
he
knew
that
they
were
going
to
be,
the
students
were
going
to
be
released
to
see
it.
he
went
to
join
up
with
the
school
even
if
he
were
truant
that
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mertz.
mr.
starr,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
06-278,
morse
versus
fredrick.
on
january
24,
2002
the
olympic
torch
relay
was
scheduled
pass
through
juneau,
alaska.
the
torchbearers
were
to
proceed
along
the
street
in
front
of
juneau
douglas
high
school
while
school
was
in
session.
the
principle
decided
to
allow
students
to
leave
class
to
observe
the
relay
as
an
official
school
event.
teachers
and
school
administrators
were
on
hand
monitor
the
event.
respondent
joseph
fredrick
the
senior
was
late
to
school
that
day
when
he
arrived
he
joined
his
friends
across
the
street
from
the
school
to
watch
the
event.
as
the
torchbearers
and
camera
crews
passed
by
fredrick
and
his
friends
unfurl
a
14
foot
banner
bearing
the
phrase
“bong
hits
4
jesus.”
their
goal,
they
later
said,
was
to
get
on
television.
the
large
banner
was
easily
readable
by
the
students
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
deborah
morse
the
high
school
principal
saw
the
sign
and
immediately
crossed
the
street
and
demanded
that
it
be
taken
down.
everyone
but
fredrick
complied,
morse
confiscated
the
banner
and
told
fredrick
to
report
to
her
office
where
she
suspended
him
for
10
days.
fredrick
sued
the
principal
and
the
school
board
claiming
a
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
the
district
court
found
no
first
amendment
violation
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
the
principal’s
actions
violated
the
first
amendment
and
that
fredrick
could
sue
the
principal
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
we
began
with
two
preliminary
matters.
first,
we
conclude
that
the
viewing
of
the
relay
by
the
students
was
a
school
event
and
that
our
school-speech
precedents
therefore
applied.
the
relay
occurred
during
normal
school
hours,
it
was
sanctioned
by
morse
as
an
approved
event
and
the
district’s
student
conduct
rules
expressly
applied.
teachers
and
administrators
were
among
the
students
and
were
charged
with
supervising
them.
under
these
circumstances
fredrick
cannot
claim
that
he
was
not
at
school.
second,
we
agree
with
morse
that
those
who
view
the
banner
would
understand
it
to
be
advocating
and
promoting
illegal
drug
use.
the
words
on
the
banner
could
be
taken
as
an
invitation
to
smoke
marijuana
or
as
a
celebration
of
drug
use.
the
words
bear
no
political
or
religious
meaning
and
fredrick
does
not
claim
that
they
do.
but
to
some
of
the
words
might
mean
nothing
at
all,
principal
morse
was
not
required
to
ignore
the
banners
undeniable
reference
to
illegal
drugs.
the
question
before
us
then
is
whether
a
principal
can
restrict
student’s
speech
at
a
school
event
when
that
speech
is
reasonably
viewed
as
promoting
illegal
drug
use.
we
hold
that
she
may.
over
the
past
four
decades
we
have
decided
three
leading
student-speech
cases.
in
the
first,
the
tinker
case
we
held
that
the
students
had
the
right
to
wear
black
arm
bans
to
school
in
non-disruptive
protest
of
the
vietnam
war.
in
the
other
two
cases
fraser
and
kuhlmeier,
we
ruled
against
the
students.
but
each
of
these
cases
recognized
two
things.
first,
students
do
not
shed
their
first
amendments
rights
at
the
school-house
gate.
second,
the
nature
of
those
rights
has
to
be
accessed
in
light
of
the
special
characteristics
of
the
school
environment.
the
rights
of
students
at
school
are
not
the
same
as
the
rights
of
adults
in
the
community
at
large.
in
another
line
of
cases
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
deterring
drug
use
by
school
children
is
an
extremely
important
interest
one
recognize
by
all
branches
of
government
not
to
mention
thousands
of
school
boards
across
the
country.
in
this
case
the
juneau
school
district
had
an
express
policy
prohibiting
expression
advocating
the
use
of
substances
illegal
for
minors.
based
on
the
special
characteristics
of
the
school
environment
and
the
government
interest
in
stopping
student
drug
abuse
we
conclude
that
schools
may
restrict
student’s
expression
promoting
such
abuse.
school
principals
have
a
difficult
job
and
a
widely
important
one.
when
fredrick
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
unfurled
his
banner
morse
had
to
decide
to
act
or
not
act
on
the
spot.
it
was
reasonable
for
her
to
conclude
that
the
banner
promoted
illegal
drug
use
in
violation
of
the
establish
school
policy
and
that
failing
to
act
would
send
a
powerful
message
to
the
students
entrusted
to
her
care
including
fredrick
about
how
serious
the
school
really
was
about
the
dangers
of
illegal
drug
use.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require
schools
to
tolerate
at
school
events
student
expression
that
contributes
those
dangers.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
souter
and
ginsburg.
