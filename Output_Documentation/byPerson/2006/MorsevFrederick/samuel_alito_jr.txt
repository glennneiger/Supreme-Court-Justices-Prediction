are
you
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
sui
generis
rule
for
speech
that
advocates
illegal
drug
use,
or
this
broader
argument
that
the
school
can
suppress
any
speech
that
is
inconsistent
with
its
educational
mission
as
the
school--

--defines
it?

well,
that's
a
very...
i
find
that
a
very,
a
very
disturbing
argument,
because
schools
have
and
they
can
defined
their
educational
mission
so
broadly
that
they
can
suppress
all
sorts
of
political
speech
and
speech
expressing
fundamental
values
of
the
students,
under
the
banner
of,
of...
of
getting
rid
of
speech
that's
inconsistent
with
educational
missions.

but
that's
a
viewpoint-neutral
regulation.
this
isn't,
the
principal
didn't
say
this
was
a
viewpoint-neutral
regulation,
did
she?
