justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can
understand
if
they
unfurled
the
banner
in
a
classroom
that
it
would
be
disruptive,
but
what
did
it
disrupt
on
the
sidewalk?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
that's
at
a
level
of
generality
that
doesn't
get
us
very
far.
i
mean,
what
specifically
did
it
disrupt?
did
it
disrupt
the
parade,
did
it
disrupt
teaching,
what
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
if
that's
the
rule,
the
school
can
make
any
rule
that
it
wants
on
any
subject
restrictive
of
speech,
and
if
anyone
violates
it,
the
result
is,
on
your
reasoning,
it's
disruptive
under
tinker.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i'm
missing
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
be
disorderly?
i
don't
understand
this
disorder.
if
somebody
holds
up
a
sign
and
says
change
the
marijuana
laws,
why
is
it
disruptive
of
anything,
simply
because
the
school
quite
naturally
has
said
we
support
the
enforcement
of
the
law,
and
the
law
right
now
does
forbid
the
use
of
marijuana.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
political
speech,
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
see
what
it
disrupts,
unless
disruption
simply
means
any
statement
of
disagreement
with
a
position
officially
adopted
by
the
school.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
disruption?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it's
calling...
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
call
for
a
change
in
the
law,
i
would
have
supposed,
was
political
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
that's
not
the
hypo.
the...
the
hypothetical
is,
what
if
there
is
a
sign
or
a
statement
in
the
school
calling
for
a
change
in,
you
know,
the
prohibition
against
marijuana
use?
as
a
call
for
change
in
the
law,
i
would
suppose
it
was
political
speech.
but
as
i
understood
the
argument
you
were
making,
it
would
still
be
regarded
as
an
exception,
as
it
were,
to
tinker,
because
it
was
disruptive.
and
it
was
disruptive
in
the
sense
that
it
disagreed
with
official
school
policy,
which
was
to
enforce
the
law
or
support
the
law
as
it
was.
is
that
your
position
on
what
disruption
means
under
tinker?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
we
have
to
be
more
specific
about
the
context
in
determining
whether
there's
disruption?
if
it's
a
school
trip
to
an
art
museum,
unfurling
a
15
foot
banner
in
front
of
the
pictures
is
clearly
going
to
be
disruptive
of
the
object
of
the
trip.
unfurling
a
banner
in
a
classroom
is
going
to
be
disruptive
to
the
teaching
of
shakespeare
or
whatever
is
supposed
to
be
going
on
in
there.
what
we
have
here
is
the
unfurling
of
a
banner
on
a
sidewalk
in
a
crowd
with
kids
throwing
snowballs
waiting
for
some...
somebody
to
run
by
with
a
tv
camera
nearby.
and
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
whether,
it
seems
to
me,
as
to
whether
it
is
in
a
kind
of
practical,
real
world
sense,
disruptive
of
anything.
and
if
there
is
such
a
question,
shouldn't
the
answer
favor
the
right
to,
to
make
the
speech
as
opposed
to
favor
the
right
to
suppress
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me,
let
me
follow,
actually
ask
you
the
same
question
on...
on
that.
because
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
you
said
certainly
that
the
school
has
got
the
right
to
have
a
policy
that
forbids
violating
the
law
and
calling
for
violations
of
the
law.
accepting
that
as
a
premise,
don't
we
need,
before
the
school
may
suppress
the
speech,
don't
we
need
at
least
a
statement
which
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
that
policy?
and
if
that
is
so,
is
bong
hits
4
jesus
inconsistent
with
it?
it
sounds
like
just
a
kid's
provocative
statement
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
given
the
fact
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
isn't
a
court
forced
into
the
position
if
it's
going
to
be
consistent
with
what
else
we
have
said,
even
at
the
final
appellate
level,
of
giving
pretty
careful
scrutiny
to
the
statement
itself
in
determining
whether
it
may
be
suppressed
or
punished?
and
if
we
do
that,
is
it
such
a
reasonable
construction
that
this
is
an...
an
incitement
to
illegal
drug
use?
i
mean
it's
a
statement
which
makes,
makes
the
drug
law
look
a
little
ridiculous,
i
think,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
very
distinguishable
from
a
statement
saying
"you
ought
to
change
the
drug
law.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
to
give...
let
me
ask
you
this.
and
maybe
this
is
the,
as
far
as
we
can
go
with
it
here.
is
that
the
answer
to
the
question
here
about
what
the
statement
means?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
we
give
deference
your
argument
wins.
but
if
we
don't
give
deference,
then
does
anybody
really
know
what
the
statement
means?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
they
ever
told
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
in
the
sense
did
the
school
ever
say,
we
are
letting
you
out
on
the
street
to
celebrate
the
olympics
and
to
do
only
that?
was,
was
there
an
object
to
this
release
from
the
school
building
that
was
ever
conveyed?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that,
does
that
general
statement
that
you
just
made
apply
to
all
circumstances
in
which
a
student-teacher
relationship
might
be
involved?
for
example,
in
the
course
of
teaching
a
class
in
shakespeare
would
your
rule
prevail?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
the
general
rule
which
the
teacher
is
supposed
clearly
to
have
known
here.
for
example,
in
the
shakespeare
class,
kid
doesn't,
doesn't
say
anything.
he
doesn't
yell
or
scream
or
even
raise
his
hand.
he
just
holds
a
little
sign
in
the
shakespeare
class
that
says
4
jesus>
["].
as
i
understood
the
general
rule
that
you
said
the
teacher
was
bound
to
know
here,
the
teacher
i
suppose
would
be
required
or
the
school
would
be
required
to
tolerate
that
sign
in
the
shakespeare
class;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
there
be
a
substantial
disruption?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
kids
look
around
and
they
say,
well,
so
and
so
has
got
his
bong
sign
again--
[laughter]
--they
then
return,
they
then
return
to
macbeth.
does
the...
does
the,
does
the
teacher
have
to,
does
the
school
have
to
tolerate
that
sign
in
the
shakespeare
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we
have
had
a
debate
here
for
going
on
50
minutes
about
what
tinker
means,
about
the
proper
characterization
of
the
behavior,
the
nonspeech
behavior.
the
school's
terms
in
dealing
with
the
kids
that
morning.
the
meaning
of
the,
of
the
statement.
we've
been
debating
this
in
this
courtroom
for
going
on
an
hour,
and
it
seems
to
me
however
you
come
out,
there
is
reasonable
debate.
should
the
teacher
have
known,
even
in
the,
in
the
calm
deliberative
atmosphere
of
the
school
later,
what
the
correct
answer
is?
