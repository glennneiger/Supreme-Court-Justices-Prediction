mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
free
speech.
it
is
not
a
case
about
drugs.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
he
does
have
a
damages
claim
against
the
school
district
and
the
principal,
but
that's
by
no
means
his
chief
object
here.
the
overwhelming
object
is
to
assert
his
free
speech--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--we
are
certainly
willing
to
negotiate
a
minimum
settlement
of
damages.
that
is
not
the
object
here.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
that
is
indeed
a
legitimate
fear,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
the
existing
law
takes
care
of
it
by
requiring
before
qualified
immunity
can
be
breached
that
there
be
a
demonstration
that
under
the
existing
law
at
the
time
available
to
her--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
think
it
was
clearly
established
at
the
time,
your
honor,
that
a
principal
could
not
engage
in
viewpoint
censorship
of
a
nondisruptive
expression,
under
both
ninth
circuit
law
and
this
court's
law.
the
case
had--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--the
rule
on
qualified
immunity?
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
believe
the
analysis
would
be
the
tinker
analysis
in
terms
of
substantial
disruption
of
the
lesson.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
it
would
all
depend
on
the
circumstances.
my
guess
is
that
if
it
were
simply
passively--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
believe
that
in
circumstances
where
it
is
a
substantial
distraction--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
if
they
had
a
content-neutral
rule
prohibiting
signs
in
school.
i
believe
that
would
be--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--certainly
it
is
within
the
school's
mission
to
discourage
drug
use.
certainly
it
has
many
tools
to
allow
it
to
get
its
own
viewpoint...
certainly
it
can...
it
does
not
need
to
provide
a
forum
in
the
school
itself
for
students
with
a
contrary
viewpoint.
but
when
a
student
is
basically
on
his
own
time,
whether
it's
outside
of
school--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--no,
i'm
not
so
sure.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
well,
what
matters
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
disruption
of
what
the
school
is
trying
to
achieve
legitimately,
whether
it's
a
classroom
lesson
or
a
lesson
on
drug
use.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
believe,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
nondisruptive
pin,
badge,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
would
have
to
be
tolerated.
however,
they
would
not
have
to
tolerate
a
student
who
interrupts
a
anti-drug
presentation.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
think
that--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
think
they
cannot
prevent
presentation
of
a
contrary
viewpoint
as
long
as
it
is
done
in
such
a
way
that
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
school's
own
presentation
of
its
viewpoint.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
no,
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--there
is
a
distinction
there.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
because
when
you're
talking
about
hate
speech,
speech
that
advocates
violence,
then
you're
in
another
category
of
speech.
there
has
been
general
recognition--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
think
there
is
a--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--well--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--no,
i'm
not
saying
only
violent
unlawful
acts.
but
this
is
a
case
where
if
you
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
state
at
the
time,
where
there
was
an
active
public
debate
on
marijuana
policy,
on
marijuana
for
medical
use,
marijuana
for
personal
use,
so
it's--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
believe
it
does
not
have
to
if
being
a
forum
would
disrupt
the
school's
own
educational
program
and--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--preventing
a
contrary
viewpoint
from
being
expressed,
that
we--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--my
response,
your
honor,
is
that,
first
of
all,
a
14-foot
banner.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
that
was
just
a
preliminary.
in
fact,
what
it
was
was
a
person
displaying
this
banner
in
a
quiet,
passive
manner
that
didn't
interfere
with
anybody's
observation.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
believe
the
answer
is
that
the
tinker
case
as
we
understand
it
struck
a
very
wise
compromise
between
allowing
school
officials
to
have
complete
discretion
to
suppress
student
speech
in
order
to
maintain
what
they
conceive
of
as
their
individual
mission
and
the
student's
right
to
speak
in
a
nondisruptive
manner.
the
speaker...
the
tinker
case
has
stood
the
test
of
time
for
40,
almost
30
years
and,
although--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--there
have
been
some
narrow
exceptions
to
it
in
subsequent
cases,
of
course,
the
frazier
and
the
kuhlmeier
cases.
but
the
basic,
the
heart
of
it,
the
requirement
that
the
school
demonstrate
that
substantial
disruption
before
it
can
engage
in
suppression
of--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
the
second
of
them
might
better
be
called
allowing
competing
viewpoints.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
think
undermining
in
the
sense
of
preventing
impeding
the
school
from
delivering
its--
own
message--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--would
be
substantial
disruption.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
believe
that
is
the
kind
of
speech--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--that
we
must
tolerate
no
matter
how
unwise
it
is.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
right.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i
think
a
content
neutral,
content
neutrality
is
critical
here,
and
if
the
school
wants
to
allow
anti-drug
comments,
messages,
then
it
has
an
outside
of
the
official
forum--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--content
neutrality
goes
to
what
speech
is
suppressed
or
punished.
as
far
as
the
school
delivering
its
own
message,
there
is
no
requirement
of
equal
time
or
that
it
be
neutral.
it's
got
its
own
viewpoint
in
the
case
of
drugs,
a
viewpoint
that
almost
all
of
us
agree
with,
and
it
should
be
able
to
espouse--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
don't
believe
that's
the
case
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
in
the
classroom
delivering
the
prescribed
messages,
in
the
school
assemblies,
when
the
school
wishes
to
present
a
particular
message,
that's
one
case.
however,
in
the
lunchroom,
outside
in
recess,
across
the
street,
that
is
a
quintessentially
open
forum
where
it
would
not
be
proper,
i
think,
to
tell
students
you
may
not
mention
this
subject,
you
may
not
take
this
position.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
no.
actually
our
primary
position
on
that
is
that
he
was
in
a
public
place
at
a
public
event
among
public
people--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--oh,
i
think
if
they
were
engaging
in
an
act
of
hooliganism--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--there
is
a
distinction
here.
this
young
man
had
not
been
in
school
today,
had
not
been
an
campus,
was
not
in
any
class
that
was
released
to--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--pardon?
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
he
explained
because
it
was
the
only
place
where
he
actually
knew
the
route
of
the
relay.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
there
is
a
major
dispute
on
that
point,
your
honor.
we
presented
several
affidavits
that
showed
individual
teachers--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--it
would
be
on
pages
32,
34,
36.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
okay.
can
i
finish
the
description
of
what
actually
happened?
according
to
the
students,
for
those
who
were
released
from
class,
there
was
no
requirement
for
staying
on
campus,
and
many
of
them
did
not
stay
on
campus.
no
requirement
for--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--some
of
them
did.
some
went
down--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--they
could,
and
many
of
them
did.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
stay
together,
no
requirement
that
they
do
anything
in
particular.
they--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--that
was
the
intent,
obviously,
for
those
released.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
but--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--actually
it
was
not.
according
to
these
student
affidavits,
they
were
simply
released
and
said,
you
can
go
watch--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--no.
it
was
decided
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
and
there
were
no
findings,
actually
no
factual
findings
at
all,
and
certainly
nothing
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
yes.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
correct.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
the...
whether
it
remains
on
the
record,
anything
that
remains
on
his
record
is
obviously
much
more--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--in
that
case,
i
missed
the
point
of
your--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--if
the
only
thing
left
were
discipline
because
he
was
tardy
that
day,
was...
didn't
divulge
the
names
of
the
other
people
holding
the
banner,
that
sort
of
thing,
we
couldn't--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--of
answering
the
question.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
those
things
wouldn't
manner
anymore.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
correct.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
two
different
time
points
we
have
to
talk
about.
there's
the
heat
of
the
moment
out
there
on
the
street,
but
then
later
back
in
the
office
when
she
actually
decided
to
levy
the
punishment
after
she
had
talked
to
him,
after
she
heard
why
he
did
it
and
why
he
didn't
do
it,
after
she
had
had
a
chance
to
consult
with
the
school
district's
counsel.
at
that
point
in
the
calmness
of
her
office,
then
she
should
indeed
have
known
it.
and
she
did
testify
that
she
had
taken
a
master's
degree
course
in
school
law
in
which
she
studied
kuhlmeier
and
frazier
and
tinker.
so--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--yes.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
we
believe
at
the
very
least
she
should
have
known
that
one
cannot
punish
a
nondisruptive
holding
of
a
sign
because
it
said
something
you
disagreed
with.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
well,
they
weren't
sponsoring
the
olympics,
they
weren't
even
sponsoring
this
event
actually.
they
simply
let
the
students
out
to
watch
it.
that
was--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--a
few
of
the
student...
a
few
of
the
relay
runners
were
from
the
school
and
had
been
allowed
to
skip
school
because
of
that,
and
the
pep
band
played
as
it
went
by.
i
do
not
believe
that
made
the
torch
relay
a
school
event.
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
them
is
that
they
let
the
students
watch
it
with
the
concurrence
of
individual
teachers,
and
that
that
attendance
was
a
school
sanctioned
attendance.
now
whether
that
allows
them
to
then
engage
in
this
kind
of
punishment
for
speech
by
a
student
who
was
not
even
among
those
released,
who
is
standing--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--we
believe
it
would
be
a
closer
question,
but
the
fact
that
he
was
not
there
in
school
today,
and
intentionally
was
not
there
today,
turns
this
into
a
pure
free
speech
case
where
you
have
a
citizen
in
a
public
place
in
a
public
event
who
was
not
acting
as
a
student.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
because
he
was
playing
hooky
because
he
chose
not
to
be
there,
because
he
was
not
part
of
the
class.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
he
joined--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--he
joined
a
public
crowd
on
a
private
side...
public
sidewalk
in
front
of
private
homes.
the
crowd
happened
to
have
some
other
students
in
that
school
there.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
yes.
the
principal
instructed
him
to
do
so
and
he
did.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
no,
i
don't
think
she
needs
to
do
that
in
the
heat
of
the
moment.
but
later
on
once
she's
discovered
the
true
facts,
then
at
that
point
i
think
she
loses
a
basis
for
punishing
him
as
a
student
if
he
was
not
there
as
a
student.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
well,
it
may
well
be
that
he
could
have
been
punished
for
being
truant,
but
of
course
that's
not
why
we're
here.
he
was
punished
for
displaying,
for
the
content
of
the
sign
he
was
displaying
in
a
public
place
as
a
private
citizen.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
most
of
them
were
classmates;
at
least
one
was
not
a
student.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
i'm
sure
he
did
know.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
a
better
analogy
might
be
if
he
had
gone
on
his
own
time
to
the
zoo
and
was
engaging
in
some
expressive
act,
and
there
happened
to
be
a
school
group
there
at
the
same
time,
could
the
teacher
with
that
group
then
have
disciplined
him
for
what
he
was
doing?
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
incorrect.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
even
suggests
that
he
went
there
in
order
to
join
up
with
schoolmates
or
in
order
to
be
near
the
school.
he
says,
in
fact,
he
intentionally
tried
to
avoid
the
school
because
he
thought
that
that
way
he
could
avoid
the
school
jurisdiction
for
his--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
think
it
would
all
depend
on
whether
he--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
fact
of
whether
he
was
a
truant
that
afternoon.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
in
the
morning
he
wasn't
in
school.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
in
the
afternoon
he
was.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
as
a
hypothetical,
if
he
were
intentionally
joining
a
school
group,
i
would
have
to
say
that
puts
him
within
whatever
jurisdiction
the
school
has.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
as
far
as
qualified
immunity,
i
think
that's
correct,
if
she
had
a
reasonable
belief.
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
on
the
merits
i
don't
think
so,
because
if
he
was
not
in
fact
there
as
part
of
a
school
group--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--i
do
not
believe
there's
anything
in
the
law
that
allows
a
principal
to
convert
a
pure
free
speech
exercise
into
a
school
exercise
because
it's--
mr.
douglas
k.
mertz
--that
is
correct.
we
have
two
independent
bases
for
defending
him
here.
one
is
the
pure
free
speech
in
a
public
place
argument.
that's
the
one
that
hinges
on
the
fact
that
he
was
not
among
the
released
students.
the
other
argument,
which
we
believe
in
equally,
is
that
even
if
it
were
a
on-campus
or
on
an
extension
of
campus
like
a
field
trip,
then
under
tinker
because
it
was
not
disruptive
they
cannot
punish
it.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
the
court.
