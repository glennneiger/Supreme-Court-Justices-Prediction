justice

so
you
want
to
get
away
from
a
hypothetical
then.
i
don't
know
why
you
try
to
defend
a
hypothetical
that
involves
a
banner
that
says
amend
the
marijuana
laws.
that's
not
this
case
as
you
see
it,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
banner
was
interpreted
as
meaning
smoke
pot,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
the
question
of
what
the
school
board's
policy
is
and
what
things
they
can
make
its
policy?
surely
it
can
be
the...
it
must
be
the
policy
of
any
school
to
discourage
breaking
of
the
law.
i
mean,
suppose
this
banner
had
said
kill
somebody,
and
there
was
no
explicit
regulation
of
the
school
that
said
you
should
not,
you
should
not
foster
murder.
wouldn't
that
be
suppressible?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
would,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
can't
we
decide
this
case
on
that
narrow
enough
ground,
that
any
school
whether
it
has
expressed
the
policy
or
not,
can
suppress
speech
that
advocates
violation
of
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
starr,
you...
you
responded
to
justice
breyer
that
you
think
the
school
could
just
prohibit
the
unfurling
of
15
foot
banners
on
a
trip.
could
it
prohibit
the
wearing
of
black
armbands
on
a
trip?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
not...
if
not,
what's
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
they
required
to
go
to
this
event
and
could
they
have
skipped
off
and
gone
home
without
violating--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
were
required
to
attend.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
school
has...
the
school
has
a
program,
an
anti-drug
program
that
shows
movies,
it
brings
in
policemen
and
social
workers
to
preach
against
drug
use
and
you're
saying
that...
never
mind
unfurling
a
banner.
you're
saying
that
it
has
to
let
students
contradict
this
message
it's
trying
to
teach,
to
walk
around,
you
know,
with
a
button
that
says
"smoke
pot,
it's
fun".
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
school
have
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
school,
even
though
it
is
trying
to
teach
one
point
of
view,
can
allow
students
to
come
in
and
undermine
that
point
of
view,
assuming
that
it's
legitimate
to
teach
that
point
of
view?
it
can
allow
students
to
come
in
and
undermine
what
it's
trying
to
teach?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
not
disruption
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
nonviolent
crimes
are
okay,
it's
only
violent
crimes
that
you
can't,
you
can
not
promote,
right?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
"extortion
is
profitable",
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
very,
very,
with
all
respect,
ridiculous
line.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
you're
saying
you
cannot
promote
things
that
are
unlawful,
but
to
say,
oh,
it's
only
violent,
where
do
you
get
that
line
from,
only
violent
unlawful
acts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that,
but
the
subsequent
cases
seem
to
me
to
try
to
cut
back
on
it.
i
mean,
it
stood
the
test
of
time
in
the
sense
that
it
hasn't
been
overruled,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
we're
using
disruption
in
two
different
senses
here
and
we
should
probably
separate
the
two.
one
sense
is
disrupting
the
class
so
that
whatever
is
being
taught
can't
be
taught.
but
you're
also
using
it
in
the
sense
of
undermining
a
general
message
that
the
school
is
trying
to
get
across:
obey
the
law,
don't
use
drugs,
whatever.
maybe
we
should
have
a
different
word
for...
the
first
is
disruption.
disruption
is
a,
is
a
funny
word
for
the
second.
let's
called
it
undermining
instead.
now,
you
think
both
of
them,
however,
are
bad
and
both
of
them
can
be
a
basis
for
suppressing
the
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
undermining
is
perfectly
okay?
you
would
never
consider
undermining
to
be
disruption
and
therefore
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
only
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
right
after
a
class
on
drugs,
he
can
be
standing
there
in
the
hall
and
say:
this
class
was
ridiculous,
drugs
are
good
for
you,
i
use
them
all
the
time,
i
urge
all
of
you.
that's
perfectly
okay?
that's
not
undermining?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
disruption?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
school
isn't
an
open
forum.
a
school
isn't
there
for
everybody
to
teach
the
students
whatever
he
wants.
it's
there
for
the
teachers
to
instruct.
and
you're
turning
it
into
an
open
forum.
if
the
school
says,
addresses
one
issue,
everybody
else
has
to
be
able
to
address
that
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
vision
of
what
a
school
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
to
watch...
not
even
watch
the
parade,
no
requirement
they
watch
the
parade?
they
were
released
in
order
to
watch
the
parade.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
intent,
it
was
the
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
only
the
intent,
it
was
the
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
is
to
us,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wasn't
playing
hooky.
he
showed
up
late,
that's
all,
right?
i
mean,
he
actually
came
and
joined
his
classmates
at
an
event
that
he
knew
was
an
event
that
the
school
told
the
classes
to
go
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
he
just
showed
up
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you're
both
a
truant
and
disrupter,
you
get
off.
[laughter]
had
you
been
just
a
disrupter,
tough
luck.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
were
the
people
that
helped
him
hold
up
his
flag?
were
they
not
classmates
of
his?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
not
know
that
these
classmates
were
there
at
a
public
event
that
was
sponsored,
not
sponsored,
but
to
which
the
school
had--
directed
the
students
to
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
like
joining
a
school
trip
at
the
zoo,
you
know.
you...
you
don't
make
it
to
the...
to
the
school,
but
you
drive
there
yourself
and
then
join
the
class
as
it's
going
through
the
zoo.
it
seems
to
me
he's
in
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
he
could
have
been
marked
absent
for
the
whole
day
because
he
didn't
intend
to
be
part
of
the
school
group
afterwards?
i
mean,
suppose
there's
a
suspension
of
so
much
for
half
a
day
truancy,
and
so
much
more
for
a
whole
day's
truancy.
and
he
shows
up
and
he
says,
oh,
you
can't...
you
have
to
hold
me
for
a
whole
day's
truancy
because
i
didn't
intend
to
be
in
school.
i
was
in
school
but
i
didn't
intend
to
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
does
it
depend
on
his
intent,
whether
or
not
he
intended
to
be
a
truant
that
afternoon?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
either
in
school
or
he
wasn't
in
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
afternoon
he
either
was
or
he
wasn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
question
is
whether
joining
the
school
group,
intentionally
joining
the
school
group,
going
there
because
the
school
group
was
there,
whether
that
places
him
in
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
appeal
to
the
calm
of
her
office
the
next
day.
i
thought
that
was
going
to
be
your
answer
to
my
question.
whatever
she
thought
at
the
time,
she
didn't
think
it
later.
