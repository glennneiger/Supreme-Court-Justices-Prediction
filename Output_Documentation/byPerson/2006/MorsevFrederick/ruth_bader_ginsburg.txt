so
if
the
sign
had
been
"bong
stinks
for
jesus",
that
would
be,
and
morse
had
the
same
reaction,
that
this
was
demeaning
to
the
olympics
and
it
was
unruly
conduct,
that
there
would
be
a
protected
right
under
tinker
because
the
message
was
not
promoting
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
may
have
made
a
difference
in
tinker.
if
the
school
had
a
policy,
defend
our
troops
in
vietnam,
would
that
have
brought
this
into
the
category
that
you
are
now
carving
out?
you
said
that
tinker
had
no
policy,
but
suppose
the
school
did
have
a
policy,
patriotism,
we
support
our
troops,
no
bad
speech
about
the
war
in
vietnam.
should
tinker
have
come
out
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
were
saturday
instead
of
a
weekday.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
were
saturday,
not
a
school
day.
and
the
school
children
were
not
required
to
show
up
at
the
olympic
event
but
were
encouraged
to
and
the
same
thing
happened.
would
it
make
a
difference
that
it
wasn't
in
the
course
of
a
regular
school
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
were
the
words
and
characterizing
them
as
offensive/but
here
one
could
look
at
these
words
and
say
it's
just
nonsense.
or
one
could
say
it's
like
mares-eat-oats.
it
isn't
clear
that
this
is
"smoke
pot".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
at...
at
this
very
rally,
i
mean
i
thought
your
brief
said
that
it's
okay
to
work
for
change
in
existing
law
which
such
a
sign
would
be,
but
it
is
not
okay
to
violate
the
law.
and
no
one
was
smoking
pot
in
that
crowd.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't,
it
wasn't
like
an
assembly,
was
it?
as
i
understand
it,
the
children
were
released
from
school,
but
they
were
not
required
to
attend
this
event
and
they
were
not
required
to
stand
in
front
of
the
school
on
the
opposite
side.
they
weren't
monitored
by
their
teachers,
so
they...
and
there
were
nonstudents
in
the
crowd.
so
it's
not
like
a
school
assembly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can't
it
just
say
no
signs
when
you're
supposed
to
be
learning?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
the
school,
couldn't
the
school
board
have
a
time,
place,
or
manner
regulation
that
says
you're
not
going
to
use
the
halls
to
proselytizer
for
your
cause,
whatever
it
may
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
reasonable
rules
of
decorum
for
what
goes
on
inside
the
school
building.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
fact
finding
on
that?
you
referred
to
affidavits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
and
i
couldn't
understand
that
somehow
you
got
mileage
out
of
his
being
truant
that
morning.
would
the
case
have
come
out
differently,
would
you
be
making
any
different
argument
if
he
got
to
school
on
time
and
was
released
with
the
rest
of
them?
does
the
case
turn
on
the
fact
that
he
was
late
to
school
that
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he's
not
a
school
child,
he
would
be
playing
hooky?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
law
required
him
to
be
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
he
go
immediately
after?
he
went
to
the
school
building
for
whatever
it
was,
the
third
period
of
the
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
to
you
clarify
one
thing.
i
initiated
this
line
of
questioning
when
i
said
i
was
surprised
that
your
brief
made
such
a
big
deal
that
he
was
late
to
school.
you
would
still
be
making
the
argument
about
the
free
speech
right
if
he
had
diligently
showed
up
for
his
math
class
first
period
in
the
morning,
gone
out
with
the
others,
and
had
his
banner
to
unfurl
when
the
torch
came
by?
