mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
illegal
drugs
and
the
glorification
of
the
drug
culture
are
profoundly
serious
problems
for
our
nation.
congress
has
so
recognized,
as
has
this
court,
time
and
again.
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
captured
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
court
has
a
number
of
amicus
briefs
before
it,
but
the
amicus
brief
of
general
mccaffrey,
secretary
bennett,
and
a
number
of
organizations.
and
particularly,
pages
5
to
9
of
that
brief,
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
the
problem
are
well-captured.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
rule
the
court...
that
it
articulated
in
tinker.
the
rule
of
the
court
as
articulated
in
tinker
is
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
right
to
political
speech
subject
to
disruption,
requirements
that
the
speech
not
be
disruptive.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
including
but
not
limited
to.
this
was
a
school
authorized
event,
this
was
education
outside
of
the
classroom.
it
was
essentially
a
school
simply
out
of
doors.
it
was
essentially--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
educational
mission
of
the
school.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
5520,
a
school
policy
of
the
board
that
says
emphatically
that
political
speech
is
protected,
embracing
tinker.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
all.
i
think
that
in
form--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
argument
is
that
this
court
in
tinker
articulated
a
rule
that
allows
the
school
boards
considerable
discretion
both
in
identifying
the
educational
mission
and
to
prevent
disruption
of
that
mission,
and
this
is
disruptive
of
the
mission--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--absolutely
not,
because
under
tinker
that
is
political
expression.
let
me
be
very
specific.
this
case
is
ultimately
about
drugs
and
other
illegal
substances.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
she
stated
in
her
answers
to
interrogatories
that
she
may
very
well
not
have
interfered
with
the
banner
had
it
in
fact
said
legalize
marijuana.
under
our
theory,
we
think
she
could
have
interfered
with
that
because
it
was
disruptive
to
the
event,
it
was
disorderly
to
the
event
itself,
but
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
your
honor,
first
of
all,
this
is,
i
think,
an
unusual
characterization,
namely
for
this
to
be
called
political
speech.
we
would--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
think
it's
a
first...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
wasn't
the
interpretation.
your
honor,
let's
back
up,
if
i
may.
someone
has
to
interpret
the
message
and
the
front
line
message
interpreter
is
the
school
official.
the
school
official--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
our...
the
answer
is
no.
because
what
we
are
also
urging
the
court
to
consider
is
its
gloss
on
tinker
and
frazier,
and
also
what
this
court
said
in
kuhlmeier.
and
in
frazier,
the
court
was
very
clear,
the
first
three
paragraphs
in
part
three
of
the
opinion,
in
talking
about
the
habits
and
manners
of
civility,
and
inculcating
the
values
of
citizenship.
that,
in
fact,
is
what
is
happening
here.
there
is
an
effort
of
the...
to
prevent
a
message
that
is
inconsistent
with
a
fundamental
message
of
the
schools,
which
is
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
is
simply
verboten,
and
we
believe
that
is
permitted
under
tinker--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
it's
certainly
not
this
case,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
was
interpreted...
exactly,
yes.
it
was
interpreted
as
an
encouragement
of
the
drug
culture
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
apologize.
the
court
can
certainly
decide
this
on
very
narrow
grounds,
that
there
are
certain
substances,
illegal
drugs,
we
would
include
alcohol
and
tobacco,
that's
part
of
the
school's
policy,
because
those
are
illegal
substances
which
are
very
injurious
to
health.
and
this
court
has
noted
that
in
bernonia
and
in
earls,
time
and
again,
it
is
that
these
are
very
dangerous
substances
and
we
have
a
clear
policy
sanctioned
by
congress,
and
also
noted
by
courts
across
the
country,
that
illegal
drugs
are
so
dangerous
that
schools
are
entitled
to
have
a
message
going--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
because
that
may
very
well
be
inconsistent
with
tinker.
tinker
articulates
a
baseline
of
political
speech
is,
in
fact,
protected,
subject
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--this
court
has
not
read
tinker
quite
so
broadly
in
both
frazier
and
in
kuhlmeier,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
aspects
of
tinker
that
i
think
are
worthy
of
note.
one,
that
there
was
no
written
policy
there,
so
there
was
an
issue
of
standardless
discretion
being
exercised.
and
also--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
it
should
not,
because
there...
i
think
there
are
concerns
with
respect
to
what
this
court
has
identified
it
is
trying
to,
even
in
the
public
school
setting,
quite
apart
from
the
university
setting,
to
cast
a
pall
of
orthodoxy
to
prevent
the
discussion
of
ideas.
what
is
happening
here
of
course
in
this
case,
it
can
be
decided
very
narrowly,
that
drugs,
alcohol
and
tobacco
just
have
no
place
in
the
schools.
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--and
that's
what
this
court
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
kennedy,
the
words
that
you
articulated
are
essentially
quotes
of
frazier
and
kuhlmeier,
so
there
is
a
broadening
of
the
lens
and
a
restoration,
frankly,
of
greater
school
discretion
in
those
two
cases
than
one
might
see
in
tinker.
they
of
course
drew,
as
you
well
know,
from
justice
black's
warning
in
dissent
of
tinker
that
the
federal
courts,
federal
judiciary
should
not
be
extending
itself
unduly
into
the
work
of
the
school
boards'--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
course.
that
is
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
can,
but
it
raises
some
interesting
potential
hypothetical
questions,
what
about
listening
to
the
voice
of
martin
luther
king
junior,
conscientious
objection
and
so
forth.
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
stray
into
those
areas
because
here
we
have
a
written
policy
which
does
in
fact
respond
to
concerns
about
the
exercise
of
standardless
discretion.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
inherently
disruptive,
but
in
fact...
the
answer
is
yes.
we're
not
saying
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
why
this
case
is
here
because
of
the
message.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
may
very
well
be.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
does
not.
but
the
juneau
school
board
and
5520,
justice
breyer,
allows...
in
fact
it
has
a
tinker
statement
in
the
first
paragraph
of
5520,
which
is
also,
you
will
not
be
advocating
drugs.
and
so
there
is
essentially
a
culture
of
liberty
in
juneau.
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
my
opinion
it
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
but
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
the
message
here
is
in
fact
critical
because
what
we
know
about
this
case
is
that,
and
you're
here
of
course
to
respond
to
this
case,
which
has
to
do
with
a
message
that
the
message
interpreter,
deborah
morse,
who
by
the
way--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
mr.
frederick
had
seen
fit
to
go
down
glacier
avenue
to
j
and
j's,
a
popular
hangout,
there
would
have
been
no
high
school
jurisdiction.
there
may
have
been
elementary
school...
but
yes.
he
could
have
gone,
justice
stevens,
to
the
state
capital
or
anywhere
along
the
ten
mile
route.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
i
think
it
still,
under
your
hypothetical
would
be
school
sponsored.
but
there
might
be
a
more
difficult
showing
of
disruption
or
inconsistency
with
the
educational
mission.
that
is
what
this
court
articulated
in
frazier
and
again
in
kuhlmeier
that
the
school
is
able
under
our
policies
of
federalism
and
value
of
federalism
and
democratic
theory
to
fashion
its
educational
mission
subject
to
constitutional
safeguards.
and
that
mission
of
preventing
the
schools
from
being
infected
with
pro-drug
messages
continues
wherever
there
is
school
jurisdiction,
and
that
would
include
on
a
saturday
field
trip
or
other
kind
of
activity
and
i
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
of
the
potential
for
disruption,
disorderliness
in
the
event
and
the
judgment
that
is
entrusted
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
the
answer
is
no.
we
do
think
that
if
the
test
that
this
court
has
articulated
which
we
embrace,
looks
not
simply
to
"disruption"
but
inconsistency
with
what
this
court
has
focused...
this
court's
language,
the
basic
educational
mission,
then
surely--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
the
key
is
to
allow
the
school
official
to
interpret
the
message
as
long
as
that
interpretation
is
reasonable.
you
might
disagree
with
that
just
as
justice
brennan
disagreed
with
whether
matt
frazier's
speech
was
all
that
terrible.
but
he
said
even
though
it
wasn't
all
that
terrible
i
nonetheless
defer
to
the
interpretation
of
school
officials.
that's
what
our
educational
system
is
about.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
your
honor,
again,
deborah
morse,
a
conscientious
principal,
interpreted
the
message
in
light
of
the
subculture
of
the
school
where
drug
use
is
a
serious
problem.
and
it
was
on
the
spot
judgment.
we
believe
that
judgment
was
reasonable
as
opposed
to
a
judgment
reached
in
judicial
chambers,
but
we
know
that
that
was
also
the
judgment
of
the
superintendent
and
district
judge--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
i
believe
you
do.
and...
well,
that's
of
course
a
question
for
the
district
judge.
and
here
the
judge
analyzed
the
facts
in
terms
of
what
the
individual
was
trying
to
say
and
determined
that
that
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
that
is
all
that
is
required
under
this
court's
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
there
are
several
gradations
that
the
court
could
take:
advocacy
of
illegal
conduct
generally;
more
specifically
advocacy
of
illegal
drugs.
but
i
believe...
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
court's
precedents
recognize...
recognize
several
different
justifications
for
restricting
student
speech.
in
tinker
itself
which
dealt
with
political
speech,
the
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
even
then,
if
the
speech
could
be
shown
to
present
a
threat
of
a
material
disruption
to
the
class
work,
and
i
think
this
would
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
teacher
wants
to
teach
shakespeare,
the
teacher
doesn't
have
to
turn
over
the
class
to
political
speech.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
discussed,
under
no
circumstances
should
deborah
morse,
a
conscientious
principal,
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages
or
compensatory
damages.
a
very
brief
factual
point.
in
light
of
the
richness
of
the
discussion
with
respect
to
the
facts,
i
would
guide
the
court
to
page
109
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
deborah
morse's
interrogatory
answer
and
there
she
sets
forth
the
facts,
and
that
bleeds
into
the
law.
to
promote
drugs...
and
this
is
our
fundamental
suggestion
and
submission.
to
promote
drugs
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
basic
educational
mission
of
the
school,
and
for
this
court
to
suggest
to
the
contrary
would
really
be
quite
inconsistent
with
much
of
its
drug
jurisprudence,
bernonia
and
earls.
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
earls
2002
is
especially
powerful
with
respect
to
the
scourge
of
drugs
and
their
dangers.
more
broadly,
the
court
does
not
need
to
go
more
broadly,
but
the
court
has
spoken
more
broadly
with
respect
to
the
need
to
defer
to
school
officials
in
identifying
the
educational
mission.
but
we
know
that
there
are
in
fact
constitutional
limits.
those
limits
are
captured
in
tinker.
a
passive
pure
political
speech
that
reflects
on
the
part
of
the
school
board
a
standardless
discretionary
effort
to
squelch
any
kind
of
controversial
discussion,
that
casts
a
pall
of
orthodoxy
over
the
classroom.
we
are
light
years
away
from
that.
i
thank
the
court.
