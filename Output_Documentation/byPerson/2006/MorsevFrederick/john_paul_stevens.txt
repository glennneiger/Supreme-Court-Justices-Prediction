john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
clear
up
one
thing
to
be
100
percent
sure
i
understand
your
position.
it
does...
the
message
is
the
critical
part
of
this
case.
if
it
was
a
totally
neutral
message
on
a
15-foot
sign,
that
would
be
okay.
you're
not
saying
15-foot
signs
are
disruptive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
we're
focusing
on
the
message
and
that's
the
whole
crux
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
also
critical
here
to
your
case
that
it
was
a
school
event.
if
it,
if
this
had
have
been
two
blocks
down
the
street
there
would
have
been
no
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
judgment
clear
enough
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
is
there
possible
debate
as
to
whether
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
message?
let's
assume
it
was
an
ambiguous
message.
would
we
have
to
accept
her
interpretation
on
summary
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
sign
said
"bong
hits
should
be
legal"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view
wouldn't
the
principal's
judgment
always
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
whether
it's
a
reasonable
judgment--
