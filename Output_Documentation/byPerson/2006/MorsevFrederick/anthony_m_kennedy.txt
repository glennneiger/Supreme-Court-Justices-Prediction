justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
this
case
limited
to
signs
about
drugs?
what
is
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
for
deciding
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
disruptive
of
what?
disruptive
of
the
classroom
order?
there
was
no
classroom
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
have...
suppose
you
have
a
mission
to
have
a
global
school.
can
they
ban
american
flags
on
lapel
pins?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
rule
you
proposed,
i
thought,
in
response
to
my
question
is
that
the
school
has
wide
discretion
to
define
its
educational
mission
and
it
can
restrict
speech
that's
inconsistent
with
that
mission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
much
broader
than
tinker.
now
you
said,
well,
there
is
an
exception
for
political
speech.
well,
but
then
you're
right
with
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
let's
suppose
that
they
have
a
particular
view
on
a
political
issue,
no
child
left
behind,
or
foreign
intervention
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
the
rationale
on
which
you
wish
us
to
decide
this
case,
nothing
more
broad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
what
your
recommendation
is
to
what
our
rule
should
be
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
not
arguing
for
the
broad
educational
mission,
which
is
what
you
said
at
the
first.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this,
this...
this
parade
had
a
theme
to
celebrate
the
olympics,
with...
the
high
school
kids
are
carrying
the
torch,
the
band
is
in
it.
and
suppose
the
banner
said
vote
for,
vote
republican,
vote
democrat.
and
he
wants
to
be
on
the
tv
with
that.
could
this,
the
principal
make
him
take
that
sign
out
of
the
ground
in
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
theme
of,
of,
of
the
parade?
something
like
our
kurle
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
different
from
the
rationale
you've
put.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
waive
damages
against
this
principal
who
has
devoted
her
life
to
the
school,
and
you're
seeking
damages
for
her
for
this
sophomoric
sign
that
was
held
up?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
student
be
allowed
to
wear
a
button
that
says
"rape
is
fun"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
concede
that
there
was
some
right
of
school
control
for
what
was
going
on
across
the
street?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
kids
were
throwing
bottles
and
injuring
passers
by,
the
principal
had
no
right
or
duty
to
go
over
there
and
stop
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
the
school
has
a
right
of
control.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
i
disagree
with
the
characterization
on
disruptive.
it
was
completely
disruptive
of
the
message,
of
the
theme
that
the
school
wanted
to
promote.
completely
disruptive
of
the
reason
for
letting
the
students
out
to
begin
with.
completely
disruptive
of
the
school's
image
that
they
wanted
to
portray
in
sponsoring
the
olympics.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
of
the
students
were
carrying
the
torch
and
the
band
was
playing
in
the
parade.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
view,
if
the
principal
sees
something
wrong
in
the
crowd
across
the
street,
had
to
come
up
and
say
now,
how
many
here
are
truants
and
how
many
here
are...
i
can't
discipline
you
because
you're
a
truant,
you
can
go
ahead
and
throw
the--
bottle.
[laughter]
