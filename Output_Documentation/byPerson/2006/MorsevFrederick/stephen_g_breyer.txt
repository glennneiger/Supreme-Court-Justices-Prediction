justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
that?
why?
i
mean
suppose
you
go
on
a
school
trip,
and
the
teacher
says
on
the
school
trip,
i
don't
want
people
unfurling
15
foot
banners.
i
don't
care
what
they
are
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
going
to
visit
the
state
capital
and
we
are
not
marching
down
the
street
with
15
foot
banners.
i
mean,
does
the
first
amendment
say
the
teacher
can't
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
said
suppose...
why
should
i
not
say
that?
i
mean
i'm
not
going
to
do
it,
necessarily.
but
why
could
i
not
say,
would
it
be
wrong
in
an
opinion
to
say
a
school
board
can
on
a
school
trip
tell
the
students
they
can't
unfurl
15
foot
banners?
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
or
not?
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
go
into
this?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
actually,
seriously
don't
understand.
suppose
the
rule
has
the
following
rule:
by
the
way,
on
our
field
trips
you
can
carry
around
15
foot
banners.
they
can
say
anything.
except
they
can't
talk
about
drugs
and
they
can't
talk
about
sex
and
they
can't
talk
about...
i
don't
know.
or
i'd
say
three
things.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
this
particular
person
had
whispered
to
his
next
door
neighbor,
"bong
hits
4
jesus,
heh
heh
heh.
"
you
know.
supposed
that's
what
had
happened?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
would
be
different...
that's
what
i...
what
a
principal
that
has
to
act
quickly
sees
across
the
street
at
a
school
meeting,
a
big
banner
go
up
making
a
joke
out
of
drug
use.
so
the
principal
acts.
now,
are
we
supposed
to
divide
that
into
little
bitsy
parts?
because
as
soon
as
we
do
we
are
going
to
get
a
rather
interesting,
complicated
and
very
difficult
set
of
constitutional
rules.
but
you
want
us
to
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you
rephrased
it
that
way,
but
what
actually
happened
is
the
principal
looks
across
the
street,
a
15-foot
banner
goes
up
at
what's
supposed
to
be
a
school
event
with
everybody
together
in
a
single
place,
and
it
says
a
joke,
it
makes
a
joke
out
of
drug
use.
the
principal
thinks
of
course
adolescents
and
post-adolescents
sometimes
like
to
test
limits,
and
if
the
kids
go
around
having
15-foot
banners
making
a
joke
out
of
drug
use
that
really
does
make
it
a
little
tougher
for
me
to
convince
the
students
at
this
school
not
to
use
drugs,
and
particularly
putting
up
15-foot
banners.
i
don't
know
why
everybody
wants
to
get
away
from
that
because
i
think
you
would
have
had
a
very
different
case
if
in
fact
it
had
been
a
whisper
or
if
it
had
been
a
serious
effort
to
contest
the
drug
laws.
it
wasn't
either.
it
was
a
joke.
it
was
a
15-foot
banner.
we
have
the
message
plus
the
means
plus
the
school
event.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
an
excellent
response,
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
conceive
that
interference
consists
of
it's
pretty
hard
to
run
a
school
where
kids
go
around
at
public
events
publicly
making
a
joke
out
of
drugs.
that's
what
his
thought
is.
now,
i
don't
think
he
has
to
be
able
to
read
content
discrimination,
viewpoint
discrimination,
time-place.
he
doesn't
know
the
law,
the
principal.
his
job
is
to
run
the
school.
and
so
i
guess
what
i'm
worried
about
is
a
rule
that
would...
is
on
your
side,
a
rule
that
takes
your
side;
we'll
suddenly
see
people
testing
limits
all
over
the
place
in
the
high
schools.
but
a
rule
that
against
your
side
may
really
limit
people's
rights
on
free
speech.
that's
what
i'm
struggling
with.
now,
i
want
some
help
there
and
i'm
worried
about
the
principal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
that's...
i
have,
i
guess
his
note,
you
accept
this
with
what
the
teacher
said.
the
entire
class
went
to
view
the
relay.
individual
students...
this
is
at
9:30
in
the
morning.
they
were
not
given
the
option
of
remaining
in
class,
nor
were
they
released
to
do
as
they
pleased.
they
were
to
watch
the
relay
with
the
rest
of
the
student
body,
either
just
in
front
of
the
school
or
just
across
the
street...
that's
me,
not
them...
and
then
return
directly
to
their
classrooms,
which
i
guess
the
school
did.
so
it
sounds
like
you're
going
to
one
place,
stand
together,
behave
yourselves,
watch
the
relay,
and
the
teachers
will
be
there
and
take
you
back
to
class.
now
is
there
something
else
in
the
record
that
suggests
something
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
tell
me
where
to
look.
where
are
the
conflicting
affidavits?
i'm
just
reading
from
page
51
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
didn't
know
there
was
a
dispute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i'll
look
at
those.
another
somewhat
minor
point.
can
i
ask
you
another
point
about
the
record?
i'll
read
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
went
across
the
street.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
any...
there
was
no
requirement,
they
didn't
have
to
go
across
the
street
or
stay
on
campus,
they
could
wander
off
distantly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
another
record
point,
just
so
i
know
where
to
look?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
also
asked
for
an
injunction
that
would
require
expunging
his
5-day
suspension
from
his
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
10
days.
well,
10
or
5,
unclear.
i
noticed
the
superintendent
of
schools
on
page
66a
when
he's
reviewing
this,
what
he
says
is,
"joseph
contends
that
all
his
behavior
is
excusable
because
he
was
exercising
his
free
of
speech
right.
"
"even
if
i
were
to
concede
his
speech
across
from
the
high
school
is
protected,
which
i
do
not,
the
rest
of
his
behavior
warranted
the
suspension.
"
and
then
he
says,
"and
i'm
cutting
it
from
10
days
to
5.
"
"so
given
that,
if
you
win,
suppose
you
were
to
win,
and
you...
that
it
is
protected
and
so
forth...
then
would
you
concede
or
not
concede
the
suspension,
the
5
days,
it's
over,
it
still
stands,
i
don't
care
about
the
expungement
or
not?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm
asking
that
you
think
about
it.
i'm
putting
you
on
the
spot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
the
superintendent
said.
as
i
read
it
is,
he
says,
look,
i
don't
care
if
this
was
protected
or
not.
i'll
give
you
that.
it's
protected.
but
the
rest
of
his
behavior,
the
way
he
treated
the
principal,
what
he
did,
the
reluctance,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
that
warrants
a
suspension
too,
and
i'm
cutting
it
from
10
days
to
5.
so
it
sounds
to
me
as
i
read
it
that
the
teacher
is
saying
even
if
you're
right,
he's
still
suspended
for
5
days.
that's
what
the
superintendent
says.
now
suppose
you
win
your
point
that
you're
interested
in
winning,
which
you
may
not
or
you
may.
are
you
still
then
going
to
pursue
this
case
on
the
5
days,
that
that
should
be
erased?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't
what?
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of
what
you
said.
you
just
got
to
the
point
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
would
not
pursue
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
it
matter?
that
is,
why
doesn't
the...
you're
suing
the
teacher
or
the
principal
and
why
wouldn't
the
issue
be
what
that
principal
really
reasonably
thought
the
situation
was?
i
mean,
if
a
principal
reasonably
thought
he
was
part
of
the
school
group,
if
the
principal
reasonably
thought
that
this
was
a
school
outing,
if
the
principal
reasonably
thought
that
students
are
staying
together,
why
wouldn't
that
just
be
the
ground
on
which
you'd
take
the
case,
we
should
take
it
that
way,
because
the
principal
reasonably
thinks?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
on
the
merits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
the
principal
couldn't
tell
him
to
take
down
the
manner
even
if
she
thought
he
was
part
of
the
school
group
reasonably,
if
he
really
wasn't?
