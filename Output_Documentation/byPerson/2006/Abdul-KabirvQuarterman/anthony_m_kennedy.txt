justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
can't
we
just
read
nelson
and
then
say
in
these
cases
whether
or
not
it's
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
see,
in
johnson
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
special
issues
and
it
makes
the
assumption
based
on
the
state's
representation
there,
that
the
special
issues
had
enough
latitude
for
a
jury
to
fully
consider
this.
what
has
happened
in
these
cases
is
that
the
prosecutors
tell
the
jury,
they
keep
reminding
the
jury
you
just
must
answer
special
issues
one
and
two
as
given.
and
in
the
cole
case
they
say,
even
though
you
felt
maybe
he
had
had
a
rough
time
as
a
kid,
you
still
must
put
that
out
of
the
mind,
of
your
mind,
and
just
go
by
the
special
issues.
and
that's
the
concern
in
these
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
because
the
issues
confined
him
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
these
decisions
post-johnson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
the
texas
case
that
says
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
we
say
that
in
the
case
of
all
childhood,
in
cases,
in
every
case
of
childhood
abuse
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
was
it
really
applied
just
in
the
context
of
the
graham
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
but
the
answer
to
justice
breyer
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
that
you
can
only
consider
it
in
the,
in
the
context
of
deliberateness
or
future
dangerousness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
if
you
know,
how
many
cases
in
the
texas
system,
capital
cases,
are
pending
that
were
decided
before
the
legislature
amended
the
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
your
answer
was
that
all
these
were
tried
before
texas
amended
the
statute.
was
it
1991
when
it
amended
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
all
the
cases
you
mentioned
were
tried
before
1991.
