justice
ruth
bader

why,
when
we
are
told
that,
that
the
state
will
surely
challenge
nelson
in
this
court,
and
we
already
have
the
issue
before
us,
so
all
that
you
would
achieve
is
delay,
just
substituting
the
nelson
case
for
this
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that,
if
the
evidence,
suppose
we
think
the
evidence
is
weaker,
it's
still
evidence
of
childhood
abuse
and
mental
disorder
of
some
kind,
and
those
are
relevant
mitigating
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
if
your
case
is
less
strong
than
maybe
the
jury
will
decide
it
the
other
way.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
those
factors
are
not
mitigating
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
same
kind
of
evidence.
it
may
be
weaker.
in
other
words,
it's
not
evidence
of
good
deeds
in
the
community.
it's
two
specific
kinds
of
evidence,
the
very
kinds
of
evidence
that
were
involved
in
penry.
you
can
argue
about
whether
this
was
weaker,
but
it's
certainly
different
from
youth
and
reputation
for
good
character.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
evidence
was
that
he
didn't
react
hostilely,
he
didn't
do
bad
deeds.
on
the
contrary,
he
was
gentle,
kind,
god
fearing,
and
that's
why
the
jury
should
regard
the
murder
as
aberrational.
that
was
the
graham
picture,
whereas
here
we're
dealing
with
people
who
are
dangerous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
other
choice
does
defense
counsel
have,
given
that
the
jury
is
going
to
get
a
question,
is
this
man
likely
to
be
a
danger
in
the
future?
what
else
could
counsel
argue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
maybe
sending
counsel
into
those
two
questions,
what
violates
the
eighth
amendment
instead
of
doing
what
texas
now
does
and
say
jury
mitigating
evidence
is
for
you
to
judge.
we're
not
going
to
bottle
it
up
inside
of
two
special
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
realistically,
a
defense
counsel
who
knows
that
the
jury
is
going
to
have
those
two
questions,
he's
got
to
fit
his
argument
to
the
jury
into
those
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
looking
at
what
texas
law
forced
him
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
jurek
was
a
facial
challenge,
and
the
court
said
no,
on
its
face
we
can
see
that
there
are
things
that
would
fit
into
it.
good
character
would
fit
into
it.
but
jurek
said
as
applied,
we're
not
certainly
not
ruling
on
that.
all
we're
saying
is
it
doesn't
fall
on
its
face,
and
then
as
cases
come
up
the
law
is
filled
out.
but
jurek
doesn't
say...
jurek
didn't
say
across
the
board,
it's
enough
that
there
are
these
two
special
factors,
that
everything
can
be
squeezed
into
them,
all
mitigating
evidence
one
way
or
another
can
be
squeezed
into
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
johnson
the
only
question
presented
was
age.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how
this
fits
in
the
graham
package.
the
graham
is,
this
child
came
from
a
deprived
background
but
managed
to
survive
it,
and
he
fits
right
into
the
category,
he's
not
dangerous.
look
at
all
the
bad
things
that
were
done
to
him.
he
turns
out
not
to
be
dangerous.
apart
from
this
one
murder,
he's
been
a
good
boy.
that's
not
the
picture
in
either
of
these
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
the
penry
court
was
talking
about,
something
like
what
you
just
read?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
30
years
old,
and
the
testimony
is
40,
50.
it
says,
jury,
for
10
years
this
man
is
going
to
be
walking
in
prison
corridors
and
he's
going
to
be
a
danger
for
at
least
10
years.
and
that's
an
effective--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
marshall,
i
heard
what
you
read
from
this
charge,
and
i
don't
have
the
exact
words
of
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
penry,
but
it
did
say
a
special
instruction
that
would
enable
the
jury
who
believed
penry
committed
the
crime
deliberately,
that
he
committed
it
deliberately,
not
slowly,
whatever
you
just
read,
but
also
believed
that
his
background
and
diminished
mental
capacity
diminished
his
moral
culpability,
making
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
unwarranted.
so
what
penry
said
very
clearly
is
yes,
it's
deliberate,
but
you
give
them
a
charge
that
tells
them
even
though
it
was
deliberate,
because
of
his
abuse,
because
of
his
retardation,
he
is
not
morally
culpable
to
the
same
extent
as
someone
who
doesn't
have
those
impairments.
that's
the
instruction
that
penry
said
could
be
given
and
that
would
be
okay
under
the
deliberateness.
quite
different
from
the
instruction
you
read.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
something
about
moral
culpability
in
what
you
read?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
penry
makes
clear,
makes
the
distinction,
between
these
are
factors
that
don't
say
he
is
that
dangerous,
don't
say
he
didn't
act
deliberately,
but
they
reduce
or
the
jury
may
decide
that
they
reduce
his
moral
culpability.
and
that's
not
what
this
charge
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
some
kind
of
a
psychological
expert
would
say
that
abuse
as
an
adolescent
is
not
as
damaging
as
abuse
as
a
young
child?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unless
you
take
the
view
that
penry
took,
which
is
you
have
to
let
the
jury
distinguish
between
dangerousness
and
deliberate
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
mitigation
for
mercy
purposes
that
don't
tie
in
at
all
to
dangerousness.
