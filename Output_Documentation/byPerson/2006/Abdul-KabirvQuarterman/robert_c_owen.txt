mr.
robert
c.
owen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
this
court
granted
review
in
mid
october
in
these
consolidated
cases,
the
cases
exemplified
the
fifth
circuit's
settled
approach
to
reviewing
claims
of
error
under
this
court's
1989
decision
in
penry
v.
lynaugh.
in
both
cases
the
court
below
failed
to
take
seriously
the
requirement
that
capital
jurors
have
a
meaningful
basis
for
giving
effect
to
the
relevant
mitigating
qualities
of
a
defendant's
evidence,
and
in
both
cases
the
court
below
found
as
a
factual
matter,
both
against
common
sense
and
this
court's
holdings,
that
reasonable
jurors
would
regard
evidence
that
a
defendant
had
experienced
significant
mistreatment
or
abuse
as
a
child
or
had
mental
impairments
as
an
adult
as
reasons
to
find
him
less
dangerous
rather
than
more
dangerous.
but
those
opinions,
however
incorrect,
no
longer
represent
the
fifth
circuit's
view
of
penry.
in
mid
december
the
fifth
circuit
decided
in
its
en
banc
decision
in
nelson
vs.
quarterman
to
take
a
sharp
turn
away
from
its
prior
treatment
of
penry
claims
and
to
follow
instead
this
court's
guidance
in
tennard
and
smith.
under
such
circumstances,
where
the
assumption
that
we
imagine
underlay
this
court's
decision
to
grant
review
in
this
case
has
been
so
profoundly
changed
by
an
intervening
decision
of
the
court
below,
we
respectfully
suggested
by
motion
that
the
court
return
these
cases,
vacate
the
judgments,
return
them
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
the
new
opinion
in
nelson.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that,
that
all
that
would
be
accomplished
by
that
would
be
certainly
not
just
delay.
i
think
that
if
the
court
chooses
to
wait
for
the
state's
cert
petition
in
nelson,
the
court
could
certainly
put
our
cases
aside
and
hold
them
awaiting
nelson...
nelson's
cert
petition
should
be
filed
by
mid
march...
and
then
could
make
its
judgment
about
whether
to
grant
cert
in
nelson
or
not.
if
it
granted
cert
in
nelson
it
could
decide
the
three
cases
together;
if
it
found
nelson
raised
no
questions
that
were
worthy
of
review,
it
could
either
proceed
to
decide
these
cases
or
send
them
back
to
the
fifth
circuit.
i
think
that
the
state's
decision,
though,
your
honor,
is
based
on
a,
a
misreading
of
nelson.
i
think
that
the
state
has
suggested
to
the
court
that
nelson
is
in
the
state's
phrase
a
narrow
fact-based
decision
and
i
think
that's
not,
i
think
that's
not
a
fair
characterization
of
the
nelson--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
the
main
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
these
cases
aren't
nelson,
and
that
nelson
if
it
presents
issues
that
are
worthy
of
the
court's
consideration,
that
would
be
the
better
vehicle,
rather
than
trying
to
use
in
effect
these
cases
to
decide
issues
that
are
presented
by
a
different
set
of
facts.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
well,
your
honor,
i
am,
i
am
confident
that
if
the
court
chooses
to
proceed
on
the
merits
of
this
case
that
we
will
prevail
on
the
merits,
until
it
finds--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--then
let
me
turn,
let
me
turn
to
our,
our
merits,
your
honor.
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
as
we
said
is
whether
the
jury
instructions
gave
the
jurors
a
meaningful
basis
for
considering
the
relevant
mitigating
qualities
of
these
two
defendants'
mitigating
evidence.
in
mr.
brewer's
case
that
included
the
fact
that
he
was
hospitalized
for
treatment
for
a
major
episode
of
depression
about
three
months
before
the
murder,
and
the
fact
that
the
evidence
indicated
he
had
suffered
serious
abuse,
serious
physical
and
emotional
abuse
from
his
father
as
a
teenager.
in
mr.
cole's
case
the
evidence
indicated
that
as
a
result
of
neglect
and
deprivation
that
he
suffered
as
a
child,
he
had
himself
emotional
problems,
fragmented
personality,
chronic
depression,
enormous
need
for
nurturance,
a
lot
of
emotional
turmoil
and
problems
that
continued
into
adulthood.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
expert
who
testified
at
mr.
cole's
trial
indicated
that
he
had
been
given
a
set
of
generally
accepted
neuropsychological
tests
and
that
on
those
tests
he
had
scored
below
normal
and
on
some
of
them
very
far
below
normal,
under
the
fifth
percentile.
and
as
a
result
that
he
probably
suffers
from
some
sort
of
central
nervous
dysfunction
which
limits
his
impulse
control.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
penry,
those
are
all
the
kinds
of
facts
about
these
two
defendants
that
could
reasonably
support
a
juror
in
concluding
that
a
life
sentence
rather
than
the
death
penalty
was
an
appropriate
sentence.
but
because
the
jurors
were
never
asked
whether
the
mitigating
evidence
reduced
the
defendant's
culpability
in
such
a
way
as
to
call
for
a
life
sentence,
the
resulting
death
sentences
are
unreliable.
the
jurors
are
asked
only
two
questions
as
the
court
well
knows.
but
just
to
review,
under
the
pre-1991
texas
statute
jurors
were
only
asked
two
questions:
was
the
crime
committed
deliberately
and
is
the
defendant
likely
to
pose
a
continuing
threat
to
society?
and
those
instructions
alone
as
has
been
mentioned
earlier
this
morning,
don't
mention
mitigating
evidence;
the
verdict
form
doesn't
mention
mitigating
evidence;
and
so
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
whether
that
two
question
format
satisfies
the
eighth
amendment's
individualized
sentencing
requirement
is
a
matter
of
the
evidence
that's
presented
in
a
particular
case,
how
it's
argued
to
the
jury,
and
what
are
the
jurors
told
about
the
meaning
of
their
instruction.
and
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
throughout
the
trial...
in
both
of
these
cases,
excuse
me...
throughout
the
trials
the
jurors
were
emphatically
told
that
they
were
not
entitled
in
deciding
the
future
dangers
test
question
to
engage
in
any
sort
of
broad
inquiry
into
these
defendants'
moral
culpability.
instead,
the
prosecutors
in
both
cases
made
very
clear
to
the
jurors
during
jury
selection
that
in
answering
the
future
dangerousness
question
you
must
put
to
one
side
your
opinion
about
whether
the
defendant's
background,
for
example,
calls
for
a
particular
sentence
and
answer
the
question
solely
on,
as
the
prosecutor
put
it,
the
basis
of
the
facts.
and
we
feel
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
very
strongly
would
have
supported
the
inference
that
these,
both
of
these
defendants
were
likely
to
be
dangerous--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
they
are
different
cases,
your
honor,
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that
they
are
closer
cases.
i
think
that
in,
in
the
juror's
mind,
the
only
conclusion
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
in
these
cases
is
that
the
defendants
are
likely
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
that
is
exactly
the
same
conclusion
that
would
have
been
compelled
by
the
evidence
in
penry.
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--absolutely.
absolutely,
your
honor,.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
couldn't
agree
more,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
clearly
settled
by
tennard
and
other
cases
going
back
to
1976
that
facts
like
a
deprived
or
abused
background
or
mental
impairment
are
certainly
mitigating.
and
with
further
response
to
your--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--this
court's
decision
in
tennard
postdates
the
state
court
decisions
in
both
of
these
cases.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
the
court
has
been
consistent--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i,
i...
i
don't
agree.
and
here's
why,
your
honor.
tennard
was
itself
both
a
habeas
case
and
a
case
governed
by
the
antiterrorism
act,
like
these
two
cases.
and
so
in
tennard
the
court
was
called
on
to
decide
not
squarely
the
question
of
whether
the
state
court
decision
in
that
case
had
been
objectively
unreasonable,
but
whether
a
reasonable
jurist
could
have
found
it
to
be
objectively
unreasonable
such
that
a
certificate
of
appealability
was
warranted.
mr.
tennard's
case
was
decided
by
the
state
court
in
1997,
so
i
think
it
is
immanent
in
this
court's
ruling
in
tennard
that
at
least
as
of
1997,
it
was
apparent
that
a,
a
low
iq
score
alone
implicated
the
concerns
of
penry.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i,
i
see
where
your
honor
is--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes.
and
i,
and
i...
no,
it
didn't
purport
to
overrule
johnson.
and
the
reason
why
is
this:
i
think
the
concept
that
ties
this
court's
cases
together
on
penry
is
this
concept
of
meaningful
consideration.
because
your
honor
focused
on
one
bit
of
language
from
johnson:
the
jury
has
to
be
able
to
give
some
effect.
elsewhere
in
the
johnson
opinion
the
court
said
there
has
to
be
a
meaningful
basis
for
giving
effect
to
the
relevant
mitigating
qualities
of
the
evidence.
and
i
think
neither
of
those
two
phrases
can
be
read
out
of
the
context
of
the
other.
in
other
words,
it
can't
just
be
some
imaginable,
conceivable,
strained
effect.
it
has
to
be
some
effect
which
speaks
sensibly
to
the
way
that
a
juror
would...
would
understand
the
evidence
to
relate
to
future
dangerousness.
in
the
johnson
case,
the
defendant's
evidence
was
his
chronological
youth,
and
i
believe
that
it
was,
it
is
sensible
for
the
court
to
find
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
conclude
that,
that
its
relevance
to
culpability
and
its
relevance
to
future
dangerousness
are
essentially
coextensive.
this
case
is
not
like
that.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
very
little
such
evidence,
your
honor,
in
mr.
johnson's
case.
and
in
that
case
moreover
this
court's
question
presented,
the
question
on
which
it
granted
review,
was
limited
to
the
question
of
age,
so
this
court
didn't
reach
or
decide
in
johnson
the
question
of
whether
the
other
facts
about
johnson's
background
that
found
their
way
before
the
jury
might
have
been
within
the
jurors'
effective
reach.
and
i
do
think
that
the
specific
evidence
in
johnson
again
was
argued
as
a
basis
for
a
finding
of
nondangerousness,
of
rehabilitatability.
that's
utterly
untrue
of
evidence
in
mr.
brewer's
case
and
mr.
cole's
case,
where
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
evidence
is
being
offered
to
provide
some
kind
of
explanation
for
the
jurors
about
what
caused
these
men
to
commit
these
terrible
crimes,
not
that--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
don't
think,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
don't
think
that
you
can
separate
the
diagnosis
of
depression,
that,
even
that
one
single
episode
of
hospitalization
for
depression,
from
what
the
jury
knew
about
mr.
brewer's
upbringing,
from
the
fact
that
they
knew
he
had
been
hit
by
his
father
in
the
terms
of,
his
mother
said,
numerous
times.
he
was
struck
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol,
he
was
hit
with
a
flashlight,
he
was
hit
with
a
stick
of
firewood.
his
father
told
him
if
you
ever
raise
your
hand
to
me
you
better
kill
me,
because
i'll
kill
you.
he
saw
his
father
bloody
his
mother,
and
bruise
her
eyes,
throw
chairs
at
her.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
that
it's
not
simply
speculation,
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
tennard
as
it
did
in
penry,
that
when
there
is
evidence
of
mental
impairment
before
the
jury,
there
is
at
least
the
probable
inference
of
dangerousness.
the
amici
before
the
court,
both
the
american
academy
of
child
and
adolescent
psychiatry,
on
the
one
hand,
the
child
welfare
league
of
america,
on
the
other,
their
amicus
briefs
i
think
really...
really
detailed
the
fact
that
this
is
a
commonplace
understanding
in
our
society.
and
the
reason
that
we
know
that,
your
honor,
is
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
his
closing
argument,
where
he
said
to
the
jury
if
you
take
a
puppy
and
you
beat
that
puppy,
then
he
is
going
to
bite
and
he
is
going
to
bite
as
long
as
he
lives.
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
to
change
that.
i
think
that
where
you
have--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
there
was
no
similar--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
court's
case
in...
decision
in
tennard,
when
it's
talking
about
the
inference
of
probable
future
dangerousness,
this
court
says:
the
jurors
might
well
have
believed
that
mr.
tennard
would
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
both
as
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
and
because
the
prosecutor
expressly
told
them
that's
how
they
ought
to
regard
the
evidence.
and
in
this
case
we
have
the
prosecutor,
in
mr.
brewer's
case
we
have
the
prosecutor
expressly
telling
the
jury,
just
as
the
prosecutor
did
in
mr.
tennard's
case,
what
is
mitigating
about
the
guy's
background--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--it
simply
doesn't
cut
as
far
in
favor
of
us,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
in
tennard
this
court
said
that
from
mental
impairment,
a
probable
inference
of
dangerousness
may
be
drawn,
cuts
squarely
in
our
favor.
and
you
don't
even
have
to
go
to
the
level
of
inference.
in
mr.
cole's
case
his
expert
witnesses
said
that
the
background
experiences
that
this
young
man
had
make
him
dangerous.
and
they,
they
could
not
forecast
exactly
how
long
it
might
be
before
he
would
conceivably
age
out
of
that.
but
they
said
is
it
10
years?
it
could
be
15
years,
it
could
be
20
years.
i
mean,
there
is
just...
that
doesn't
give
a
reasonable
juror,
as...
if
all
you
ask
the
juror
is,
after
they
have
heard
that
evidence
is,
is
there
a
probability
that
this
guy
is
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future?
i
think
they
would
be
compelled
to
say
yes,
even
though
they
might
say,
if
they
were
broadly
instructed--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
that
it's
not
unconceivable
that
a
juror
could
have
reasoned
in
that
fashion.
but
i
think
it's
not
reasonably
possible.
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
penry
and
tennard
suggest
that
a
juror's
commonsensical
response
to
evidence
that
a
defendant
has,
presently
poses
a
grave
danger
as
a
result
of
his
life
experiences
and
the
enduring
impacts
that
they
have
left
upon
him,
the
reasonable
response
of
a
juror
shown
such
evidence
is
to
find
future
dangerousness,
and
that
that
is
precisely
the
problem
with
the
pre-1991
texas
sentencing
statute.
if
we
had
a
broad
mitigating
evidence
issue
like
the
one
that's
presently
given
to
texas
juries
then
we
could
all
be
confident
that
the
jury
had
engaged
in
precisely
the
reasoning
that
the
court...
that
the
court
is
hypothesizing.
that
they
looked
at
the
evidence
and
said
yes,
he's
dangerous,
but
he's
also
deserving
of
something
less
than
death
so
we
will
accomplish
that
by
answering
this
issue
in
a
certain
way.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
don't...
no,
your
honor,
and
don't
let
me,
please
don't
let
me
be
misunderstood.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
per
se
rule.
i
think
johnson
stands
with
our
case.
i
think
that
graham
stands
with
our
case.
i
think
there's
no...
there's
no
need
for
the
court
to...
to
change
anything
other
than
to...
and
it
doesn't
have
to
change
anything
about
its
existing
approach
to
penry
for
our
clients
to
prevail.
because
i
think
that
if
the
court
looks
at
this
evidence
and
concludes
that
a
reasonable
juror
approaching
this,
there's
no
reasonable
probability
that
they
would
have
felt
constrained
to
find
him
to
be
a
future
danger,
then
we
lose.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
this
record
and
see
that.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think,
your
honor,
that
again,
removing
that
language
from
smith,
from
the
language
in...
if
you're
talking
about
johnson,
i
know
you're
referring
to
johnson,
that
the
language
in
johnson
about
some
effect
can't
be
separated
from
the
language
about
meaningful
effect.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
correct.
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
it
is
unreasonable.
i
think
the
state
court
in
this
case
had
essentially
two
lines
of
authority,
that
it
was
trying
to
decide
which
one
controlled
this
case.
it
had
penry
which
involved
evidence
of
mental
impairment
and
child
abuse,
and
it
had
johnson
and
graham
which
involved
evidence
of
youth
and
other
background.
and
i
think
that
the
facts
of
these
cases,
given
the
facts
of
these
two
cases,
it
is
objectively
unreasonable
to
say
they
fit
over
here
with
johnson
and
graham
rather
than
they
fit
over
here
with
penry.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
decisions
by
the
state
courts
are
not
just
wrong,
but
objectively
unreasonable.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
about
graham
since
it's
been
a
subject
of
some
discussion.
first
is
to
remind
the
court
that
graham
was
a
teague
case.
graham
was
a
case
about
whether
the
law
in
1984,
prior
to
penry...
mr.
graham's
case
became
final
on
direct
appeal...
dictated
the
result
that
he
was
asking
for,
which
i
think
doesn't
mean
it
has
no
persuasive
impact
on
these
cases,
but
i
certainly
think
it
limits
its
precedential
value
outside
the
scope
of
the
question
of
youth
that
johnson
later
settled
squarely.
the
second
thing
i
want
to
say
about
graham
is
this
is
the
state's
brief
in
graham,
91-7580,
and
i
want
to
just
note
that
at
page
26,
squarely.
this
is
the
state's
brief
in
graham
917580
and
i
want
to
note
at
page
26,
footnote
8
the
state
says
the
insubstantiality
of
graham's
evidence
of
a
troubled
childhood
is
readily
apparent,
which
certainly
suggests
that
there
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
evidence
in
graham
of
this
background
evidence
as
not
being
substantial,
not
being
evidence
about
abuse
or
mistreatment.
the
fact
that
he
was
moved
from
one
relative
to
another
because
of
the
circumstances
in
his
family,
in
that
case
was
not
shown
to
have
any
negative
impact
on
him.
whereas
i
think
in
mr.
cole's
case
certainly
there
is
expert
testimony
that
it
had
a
very
devastating
negative
impact
on
him.
so
graham
really
does
not
even
give
the
court
much
guidance
on
the
question
of
troubled
background
because
there
is
no
indication
that
graham
actually
had
a,
a
background
of
mistreatment.
by
the
same
token
with
respect
to
the
state's
comment
or
my
brother's
comment
that
the,
the
record
doesn't
bear
out
that
mr.
brewer
was
struck
by
his
father
with
a
stick
of
firewood,
that
is
correct.
what
the
record
actually
says
is,
if
i
may
quote
from
the
brewer
ja
at
page
90...
95...
65,
excuse
me:
"he
tried
to
hit
him
with
a
stick
of
firewood.
"
"when
he
went
outside
to
grab
the
firewood
i--
"
--that's
mr.
brewer's
mother...
"slammed
the
front
door
and
locked
it,
and
he
smashed
the
glass
out
of
the
front
door
with
the
firewood.
"
"that
was
the
night
i
had
him
arrested.
"
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
believe
he
was
15,
your
honor.
but
i
also
want
to,
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
i
think
there,
the
fact
is,
the
testimony
is
that
mr.
brewer
was
hit
numerous
times.
that's
his
mom's
word.
hit
with
objects
only
twice,
but
hit
numerous
times.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
also
underestimate
the
significance
of
the
evidence
that
mr.
brewer
saw
his
father
brutalize
his
mother
on
many
occasions,
because
that
evidence
too
contributes.
it's
not
just
the
difference
between
being
hit
and
watching
someone
else
being
hit.
i
think
everyone
understands
that
there
are
enduring
feelings
of
shame
and
guilt,
and
that
the
teenage
son
feels--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i,
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
not
our
argument,
first,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
the
court's
question
was,
as
i
understand
it,
don't
we
have
to
show
there
is
no
way
the
jury
could
have
understood
this
evidence
except
as
aggravating?
i
don't
think
that's,
i
don't
think
that's
the
test.
in
tennard
this
court
said
if
the
jury
might
well
have
considered
the
evidence
as
aggravating,
then--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--in
some
manner
that
is
reasonable
and
that
gives
effect
to
the
relevant
mitigating
qualities
of
the
evidence.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
do
think
that
the,
that
the
fact
of
mr.
brewer's...
the
fact
that
the
jury
knew
that
he
had
endured
this
mistreatment
as
a
teenager
could
only
have
been
given
aggravating
effect.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
to
reason
from
the
premise
that
he
was
mistreated
physically
and
emotionally
by
his
father
when
he
was
a
teenager,
to
the
conclusion
that
therefore
he
will
be
less
dangerous
in
the
future.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
connection.
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
calling
for
in
johnson
was
that
there
be
some
sensible
link
between
the
proffered
mitigating
evidence
and
these
narrow
questions,
which
as
has
been
pointed
out
already
were
the
only
options
for
the
jury
in
this
case.
there
was
no,
there
was
no
mercy
option.
there
was
no
mitigation
instruction.
the
jury
was
told
solely
these
two...
these
two
special
issues.
with
respect
to
the
brewer
argument
that
there
was
a
deliberateness
instruction,
i
think
justice
ginsburg
has
it
exactly
right
in
observing
that
in
penry,
what
the
court
said
was
that
to
satisfy
the,
you
know,
to
fix
the
deficit
in
the
former
texas
special
issues,
a
definition
of
deliberateness
would
have
to
direct
the
jury's
attention
to
the
defendant's
personal
culpability.
and
i
don't
think
this
instruction
does
that.
this
instruction
directs
them
to
the
sort
of
quantity
of
forethought,
how
much
did
he
think
about
it,
how
long
did
he
think
about
it,
did
he
mull
it
over?
but
i
don't
think
that
that
captures
the
moral
culpability
aspect
that
penry
says
is
required
under
the
eighth
amendment.
if
the
court
has
further
questions
i'm
happy
to
entertain
them.
otherwise
we
would
ask
that
the
court
grant
our
motions.
in
the
alternative
we
would
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgments
in
both
cases
with
directions
to
reinstate
the
district
court's
favorable
judgment
in
mr.
brewer's
case
and
to
grant
habeas
relief
in
mr.
cole's
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
