justice
antonin
scalia
tennard,
tennard
was
decided
after
the
state
decision
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
where
is...
this
is
an
aedpa
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're,
we're
asking
whether
this
state
court
made
an
unreasonable
decision
at
the
time,
and
at
the
time
regardless
of
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
now
said,
at
the
time
under
johnson,
and...
and
there
is
another
earlier
case,
we
said
that
you
didn't
have
to
give
full
mitigating
effects;
as
long
as
there
was
some
manner
in
which
mitigating
effect
could
be
given
that
was
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
think
tennard
is
utterly
irrelevant
even
if
it
is
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
tennard
purport
to
overrule
smith,
even
when
it
came
down?
it
simply,
it
simply
quoted
language
of
the
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
an
earlier
case.
it
certainly
didn't
purport
to
overrule
smith?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
johnson,
not
smith.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
absolutely
one
step
removed
from
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say
the
actual
question
is
even
one
step
removed.
it's
whether
it
is
unreasonable
to
conclude
otherwise
than
what
you
conclude,
which
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
striking
a
big--
person
is
not
quite
as
bad
as
striking
a
little
person.
