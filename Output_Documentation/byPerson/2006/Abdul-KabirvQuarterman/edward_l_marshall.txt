mr.
edward
l.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
state
court
considered
these
penry
claims
in
1994,
1999
and
january
2001,
this
court's
decisions
in
graham
and
johnson
made
it
clear
that
the
eighth
amendment
requires
only
that
a
jury
be
only
able
to
consider
mitigating
evidence
in
some
manner,
not
in
every
conceivable
manner.
this
is
because
virtually
any
mitigating
evidence
may
be
viewed
as
relevant
to
moral
culpability
apart
from
its
relevance
to
these
texas
special
issues.
cole
and
brewer
with
sizzling
bright
iq
scores
of
121
and
115,
dysfunctional
childhoods
and
depression,
are
much
more
like
the
troubled
childhood
and
youth
evidence
in
graham
and
johnson
than
the
mental
retardation,
brain
damage
and
severe
child
abuse
evidence
in
penry.
equating
these
facts
to
penry--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
in
graham
in
particular,
the
court
was
not
just
considering
youth,
the
court
was
considering
a
troubled
childhood,
a
difficult
childhood
in
which
graham's
mother
had
been
hospitalized
with
a
mental
illness,
his
custody
shifted
from
relative
to
relative.
that's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
evidence
we
have
in
cole.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
way
counsel
argued
it
to
the
jury
in
either
case.
in
both
of
these
cases
defense
counsel
presented
his
case
to
the
jury
during...
through
his
evidence
and
his
argument,
that
this
was
youthful
indiscretion
or
it
was
an
aberration,
and
it
wouldn't
happen
again,
which
is
exactly
what
graham--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
eighth
amendment
was
violated
and
whether
the
jury
had
a
reasonable
opportunity,
and
in--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court,
though.
we're
trying
to
determine
in
this
case
whether
the
state
courts
unreasonably
determined
that
these
juries
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
consider
that
evidence.
and
i
think
looking
at
argument,
when
we're
determining
the
reasonableness
of
that
decision,
looking
at
counsel's
argument
is
all
we
have
to
go
on
in
determining
whether
the
jury
had
a
fair
shot.
now
i
think
if
you
look
back
at
the
'90s--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
that
was
a
strategic
choice,
though.
this
is
not
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
we're
looking
at
the
eighth
amendment
now.
and
so
what
counsel
chose
to
do
is
not
the
question.
we're
looking
at
what
he
did,
and
we've
got
this
record
to
work
with.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue
before
the
court,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we're
looking
at
is
whether
he...
the
jury
had
a
fair
opportunity
here,
regardless
of
what
counsel
chose
not
to
do
or
what
the
statute
forced
him
to
do.
the
fact
is
when
the
state
courts
looked
at
these
claims
in
1994
and
1999,
this
evidence
was
much
more
like
graham
than
it
was
like
penry,
and
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
decide
that
there
was
no
penry
error
in
these
cases
because
of
that
fact.
and
i
think
it's
worth
mentioning
that
if
that's
not
the
case,
then
i
think
we've
arrived
at
the
point
where
penry
has
swallowed
the
rule
announced
in
jurek
31
years
ago
and
it...
to
which
it
was
only
supposed
to
be
an
exception.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
jurek
was
a
facial
challenge.
but
in
johnson
and
graham
the
court
made
it
pretty
clear,
i
think,
that
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
relevant
in
some
way
within
those
special
issues,
some
mitigating
way--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--in
johnson,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
youth
was
the
central
point
of
johnson,
but
graham
involved
youth
and
a
distinctly
troubled
childhood,
much
like
we
have
in
these
cases.
and
so
if
that
evidence
was
relevant
within
future
dangerousness
and
did
not
amount
to
eighth
amendment
error,
then
this
evidence
has
to
be
just
as
relevant.
and
in
fact
we
have
another
layer
of
analysis
on
top
of
this
because
we
are
looking
at
the
state
court's
decision
under
aedpa.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
essentially
the
picture,
justice
ginsburg,
in
brewer.
that's
exactly
the
way
counsel
presented
it
to
the
jury.
but
not
only
did
counsel
argue
that
he
wasn't
going
to
be
dangerous
despite
his
childhood
shortcomings,
there
was
a
deliberateness
definition
submitted
in
the
brewer
case,
which
is
what
this
court
suggested
in
penry
in
1989
might
remedy
this
problem.
and
so
the
court
submitted
a
definition
of
deliberateness
and
counsel
argued
it
to
the
jury,
that...
the
definition
was
read
to
the
jury,
counsel
argued--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--it
appears
at
page
90
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
brewer
joint
appendix.
now
counsel
read
that
definition
to
the
jury,
and
the
definition
reads
as
follows:
"a
manner
of
doing
an
act
characterized
by
or
resulting
from
careful
and
thorough
consideration
characterized
by
awareness
of
the
consequences,
willful,
slow,
unhurried
and
steady,
as
though
allowing
time
for
a
decision.
"
now
counsel
read
that
definition
to
the
jury
during
his
closing
argument.
he
argued
that
brewer's
crime
reflected
poor
planning
and
execution,
that
he
was
led
into
it
by
other
actors,
by
his
girlfriend
christy
nystrom,
and
that
his
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital
and
his
mental
illness,
depression
in
this
case,
were
argued
specifically
as
cause
for
those
faults.
and
so
counsel
related
the
evidence
within
that
deliberateness
instruction
to
the
jury,
and
that
provided
them
with
a
significant
vehicle
to
give
effect
to
this
evidence.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
think
so,
your
honor,
and
the
penry
court
was
not
specific
about
what
that
definition
should
say,
but
this
is
certainly
helpful
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
in
taking
account
some
of
this
evidence
that
was
before
it.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that
may
be
a
concern,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
cole
case
provides
a
particular
example
of
how
defense
counsel
countered
that
argument.
75
percent
of
his
argument,
which
is
between
pages
141
and
144
of
the
cole
joint
appendix,
75
percent
of
that
argument
is
that
cole
will
burn
out
as
he
grows
older,
and
that's
based
on
the
testimony
of
his
experts.
and
he
says
that
burnout,
that
likeliness
that
he
will
not
be
dangerous
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that's
a
legitimate
argument
on
the
evidence
here,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be,
it's
difficult
in
my
mind
anyway
to
determine
that
the
state
court
in
reading
graham
and
johnson
could
unreasonably
determine
that
that
wasn't
a
good
vehicle
for
the
jury
when
he
said,
you
have
a
reasonable
doubt
about
this
man's
dangerousness
because
of
the
testimony
that
we
presented
to
you
from
his
experts
that
said
he
wouldn't
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
ginsburg,
that's
easily
as
effective
as
the...
as
youth
was
in
graham
and
johnson.
youth
is
evidence
that...
i
mean,
we
don't
know
how
long
it
takes
people
to
grow
out
of
youth,
but
certainly
10
years
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances
in
that
case.
and
so
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
youth
and
burnout
in
this
context.
we
are
talking
about
a
finite
amount
of
time,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
that
amount
of
time
is,
but
it's
certainly
reasonable
for
a
jury
to
give
mitigating
effect
to
it
under
that
question.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
it's
different,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it's
that
much
different,
and
the
reason
is
that
this
makes
the
crime
a
function
of
awareness
of
the
consequences
of
slow
unhurried
consideration
of
those
consequences.
and
then
counsel
argues
to
the
jury
that
brewer
is
uncapable
of
engaging
in
that
sort
of
premeditation
because
of
his
mental
problems,
and
so
that's
what
reduces
his
culpability
under
the
circumstances.
and
i
think
if
you
combine
the
argument
and
the
definition,
which
we
were
bound
to
do
under
boyde
versus
california,
we're
supposed
to
look
at
the
entire
context
of
the
trial
here,
that
that
meets
that
suggestion
in
penry
for
it.
it's
not
exactly
what
the
court
suggested.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
mentioned
in
this
definition.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
this
charge
is
different
and
you're
correct
in
that,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
future
dangerousness
also
provides
that
vehicle
in
this
case,
just
the
same
as
it
did
in
graham,
and
so...
and
in
johnson.
the
court
said
that
this
kind
of
evidence,
the
evidence
of
a
troubled
childhood,
could
find
effect
within
future
dangerousness
in
some
manner.
and
granted
we
can
conceive
of
other
ways
it
might
be
relevant
to
culpability,
but
the
court
explained...
and
this
was
what
the
state
court
was
working
with
at
the
time
it
considered
this
claim...
this
court
explained
that
just
because
we
can
imagine
other
ways
in
which
it
might
be
relevant
doesn't
mean
that
we
have
got
eighth
amendment
error.
it's
just
important
that
the
jury
had
some
way
of
getting
to
it.
and
i
don't
see
how
this
is
markedly
different
than
the
evidence
that
the
court
said
fit
within
future
dangerousness
in
graham.
now,
in...
i
think
another
thing
that
i
need
to
mention
about
cole
is,
is
that
my
colleague
noted
the
expert
testimony
that
cole
lacked
impulse
control.
now,
i
think
the,
the
mitigating
nature
of
that
testimony
in
this
case
becomes
especially
apparent
when
you
realize
that,
that
cole
planned
this
crime
2
days
in
advance.
he
planned
to
strangle
this
66-year-old
blind
man
2
days
before
he
did
it.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
an
impulse
control
problem
mitigates
his
culpability
for
this
crime
in
any
way
and
i
don't
think
any
reasonable
juror
would
ever
see
that.
so
i
think
that
the
mitigating
significance
of
that
evidence
in
this
case
is
severely
diminished
as
opposed
to
the
testimony
that
the
jury
heard
in
penry,
for
example,
which
is
that
he'll
never
learn
from
his
mistakes,
he
had
previously
committed
a
rape,
he
didn't
learn
from
it;
this
time
he
committed
a
murder
and
a
rape.
and
so
the
mitigating
relevance
of
that
evidence
was
only
aggravating
within
future
dangerousness.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
there
is
no
harmless
error
question,
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
think
when
we're
looking
at
the
boyde
standard,
which
is...
and
in
johnson...
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
precluded
from
giving
effect
to
the
evidence,
the
reasonableness
of
that
likelihood,
the
reasonableness
of
that
possibility,
depends
upon
the
way
the
juror,
the
jury,
heard
the
evidence
and
the
relative
strength
of
that
evidence.
and
so
evidence
of
intoxication,
for
example,
while
it
does
mitigate
culpability
in
some
manner,
would
not
create
the
reasonable
possibility
of
eighth
amendment
error
in
that
sense.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
addition
to
all
of
that,
the
state
court
was
looking
at
penry
and
graham
when
they
decided
this
case
and
there
was
no
penry
ii
yet.
there
was
no
tennard
or
smith.
and
so
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
compare
the
evidence,
the
weight
of
that
evidence,
the
strength
of
that
evidence,
to
those
cases
and
decide
that
it
fell
on
the
graham
and
johnson
side
of
the
line
rather
than
the
penry
side
of
the
line.
that's
the
only
thing
they
could
do
at
the
time.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
justice
stevens,
if
we
take
into
account
the
full
effect
language
that
gets
quoted
in
penry
ii,
we
might
well
have
a
different
result.
but
that
wasn't
the
standard
at
the
time
and
under
aedpa--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
under
teague
they
did
not
purport
to
change
the
law.
but
i
think
aedpa
is
a
different
inquiry
here.
we're
looking
at
what
clearly
established
law
was
at
the
time
the
state
courts
made
their
decisions
and
not
necessarily
what,
you
know,
what
the
teague
inquiry
would
be.
and
so
at
that
point
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
under
graham
and
johnson
we're
looking
at
some
effect.
whatever
"full
effect"
means
now,
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
cases.
and
i
think
that
gets
to
the
main
point
here.
we're
looking
at
an
exceedingly
ordinary
fact
pattern
in
a
capital
murder
case
in
both
of
these
cases:
dysfunctional
childhoods,
a
small
amount
of
abuse
in
brewer,
undescribed--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
brewer
case
was
decided
the
year
after
johnson
and
the,
the
cole
case
was
decided
in
1999.
so
the
court
had
not
held
forth
on
what
penry
meant
in
a
long
time
at
that
point.
graham
and
johnson
were
the
last
clear
statements
the
court
had
made.
now,
i
want
to
correct
one
misstatement
by
my
opposing
counsel
in
brewer.
brewer
was...
there
are
three
distinct
episodes
of
abuse
that
appear
in
the
record
in
that
case:
that
he
was
struck
with
a
pistol
by
his
father,
he
was
struck
with
his
fist,
and
struck
with
a
flashlight.
he
was
never
struck
with
a
stick
of
firewood,
and
that's
on
page
65
of
the
joint
appendix.
that's
pretty
clear.
this
isolated
abuse
that
occurred
late
in
life...
we
don't
know
the
exact
time
frame,
but
it
could
be
as
late
as
age
18
or
19...
surely
has
different
characteristics
in
a
jury's
eyes
than
the
evidence
in
penry
which,
in
which
the
defendant
was
beat
and
beat
severely
from
a
very
young
age,
from
his
infancy,
and
that
beating,
that
abuse,
caused
brain
damage
or
mental
retardation.
the
ordinary
nature
of
this
evidence
in
comparison
to
the
exceptional--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--i'm
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
this
is
a
smaller
amount
of
abuse
than
what
was
in
penry.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
there
is,
there
is
that--
reasonable
likelihood
standard
built
in
under
boyde.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
of
constitutional
error.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
is
the
reasonable
likelihood--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--reasonable
likelihood
that
the
juror
was
precluded
from
considering
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
reading
of
graham
and
johnson,
though,
your
honor,
that
weak
evidence
does
fit
within
these
special
issues.
that's
what
those
cases
held.
they
said
the
jury
could
consider
the
evidence
in
some
manner
and
therefore
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
were
precluded
from
doing
so.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
your
honor,
the
state
court
considering
this
case
was
looking
at
graham,
in
which
the
court
stated
that
that
evidence
fit
within
future
dangerousness.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
justice
breyer,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
the
answer
is
yes
because
this
court
said
it
was
yes.
this
court
said
that
in
graham
the
jury
was
free
to
accept
counsel's
suggestion
that
graham's
conduct
was
merely
an
aberration
and
that,
and
that
he
wouldn't
do
it
again.
that's
exactly
the
way
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury
by
these
two
defense
lawyers.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
your
honor,
it's
not
a
texas
case.
it's
this
court
in
graham
and
johnson.
this
court
said
that
evidence
of
a
troubled
childhood,
of
the
particular
dysfunction
that
comes
with
youth,
can
be
taken
as
an
aberration,
that
the
person
will
not
repeat--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--the
question
is--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
your
honor,
in
these
cases
it's
relevant
for
the
same
reasons
it
was
in
graham.
this
evidence
is
not
enough
like
penry
to
warrant
relief.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
way
to
do
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
has
continually
engaged
in
a
case-specific
analysis
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
these
types,
when
granting
these
types
of
claims.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--that's
because,
justice
ginsburg,
the
penry's
evidence
was
relevant
only
in
an
aggravating
way
to
those
issues.
it
suggested
nothing
other
than
the
fact
that
he
would
be
a
future
danger,
and
when
the
evidence
is
not
so
aggravating,
when
the
evidence
suggests,
suggests
that
there
is
a
mitigating
answer
to
the
future
dangerousness
question,
that
the
person
won't
be
a
future
danger
because
they're
going
to
burn
out
or
because
this
is
an
isolated
incident,
we
have
a
different
situation.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
kennedy,
there
are
47
inmates
on
texas
death
row
that
were
sentenced
under
this
statute
that
remain
there.
there
are
nine
cases
which
have
litigated
penry
claims
all
the
way
to
conclusion
in
federal
court.
there
are
25
more
that
are
somewhere
in
the
pipeline
either
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
i've
actually
looked
at
the
cases
and
17
of
those
cases,
17
of
the
34
that
are
still
in
the
system,
have
evidence
that's
almost
identical
to
these
cases.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes.
47.
47
cases
were
sentenced
under
this
pre-1991
statute.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
ask
that
they
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
