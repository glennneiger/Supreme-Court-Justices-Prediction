if
the
question
is
one
of--
the
evidence
was
weak,
why
isn't
that
a
harmless
error
question
rather
than
a
question
of
whether
the
jury
can
give
it
effect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
likelihood
of?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
constitutional
error--
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
the
evidence
is
very
weak
and
if
the
instructions
prevent
you
from
considering
it,
then
it's
precluded.
but
if
the
evidence
is
very
weak
it
didn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
imagine
you're
a
juror
and
you
think
to
yourself,
i
see
all
this
stuff
about
the
childhood,
frankly
it
doesn't
move
me
so
far
as
his
dangerousness,
i
think
he's
dangerous,
and
i
also
think
he
did
it
deliberately.
and
then
you
think
to
yourself,
well,
could
i
consider
it
because
it
shows
a
bad
childhood
and
that
is
deserving
of
a
life
term?
i'm
not
sure
it
shows
me
that,
but
can
i
consider
it
for
that
purpose
at
all?
what's
my
answer
under
texas
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
have
gotten...
i've
finished
considering
it
for
future
dangerousness.
no,
it
doesn't
move
me;
he's
dangerous.
now
i
say
to
myself,
can
i
consider
it
for
the
purpose
of
showing
a
bad
childhood
deserving
of
mercy,
if
you
like?
can
i
consider
it
for
that
purpose?
what's
the
answer
under
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
future
dangerousness.
i'm
talking
about...
i
would
be
repeating
myself.
you've
taken
that,
i'm
not
talking
about
future
dangerousness.
the
jury's
decided
that
matter
in
your
favor.
i'm
saying
does
texas
law
allow...
you
understood
what
i
said,
didn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
you
can
take
it
in
to
show
mercy?
