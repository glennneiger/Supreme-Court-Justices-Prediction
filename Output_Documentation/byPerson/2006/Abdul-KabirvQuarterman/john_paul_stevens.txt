your

is
that,

it
may

be
true
that

justice

these
cases
come
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
both
cases
petitioner’s
claim
that
the
former
texas
capital
sentencing
statute
in
impermissibly
prevented
the
sentencing
jury
from
giving
meaningful
consideration
to
institutionally
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
we
agree,
and
accordingly
we
reverse
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
cases.
both
petitioners
were
convicted
of
capital
murder,
death
sentencing
one
of
them
presented
mitigating
evidence
of
childhood
neglect
and
abandonment
and
possible
neurological
damage.
the
other
presented
mitigating
evidence
of
mentally
illness,
substance
abuse
and
a
troubled
childhood.
in
both
cases
the
texas
state
court
denied
petitioners
relief
on
direct
appeal
and
post
conviction
review
and
the
fifth
circuit
denied
federal
habeas
relief.
the
cases
implicate
the
same
concerns
raised
repeatedly
in
this
court
regarding
a
jury’s
ability
to
give
adequate
consideration
to
capital
defendant’s
proffered
mitigating
evidence.
our
first
important
opinion
confining
this
issue
was
written
by
chief
justice
berger
in
lockett
v.
ohio
in
1978.
his
opinion
which
has
been
repeatedly
followed
concluded
that
sentencing
juries
must
not
be
precluded
from
considering,
as
a
mitigating
factor
any
aspect
of
a
defendant’s
character
or
record
and
any
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offence
that
may
provide
a
base
for
imposing
a
sentence
less
than
death.
a
little
over
a
decade
later
in
penry
v.
lynaugh,
we
reaffirmed
that
basic
rule
in
the
more
specific
context
of
texas
capital
sentencing
jury
instructions.
under
the
version
of
the
texas
statutes
applicable
to
both
of
these
petitioners
at
the
time
of
their
sentencing,
the
jury
answers
to
two
special
issues
determine
whether
the
defendant
would
be
sentenced
to
death.
first,
was
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
to
cause
the
death
of
the
deceased
committed
deliberately
and
with
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
death
would
incur
and
second
is
there
are
probability
that
the
defendant
would
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
who
would
constitute
a
continue
threat
to
society.
in
affirmative
answer
to
those
questions
required
the
jury
to
impose
the
death
sentence,
no
matter
how
persuasive
the
defendant’s
mitigating
evidence
might
be.
in
penry
we
held
that
neither
of
these
two
instructions
known
as
“the
deliberateness
and
future
dangerousness
special
issues”
provided
the
jury
with
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
give
the
fact
to
the
defendant’s
mitigating
evidence
of
mental
retardation
and
childhood
abuse.
as
we
explained
in
that
opinion
the
defendant
may
present
evidence
about
his
background
or
character
or
about
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
that
is
either
irrelevant
to
the
special
issues
or
that
has
relevance
to
defendant’s
moral
culpability
for
the
crime,
beyond
the
scope
of
the
special
issues.
in
either
of
them
the
texas
special
issues
do
not
provide
the
jury
with
a
mean
through
expressing
this
reason
to
moral
response
to
that
evidence
in
determining,
whether
the
defendant
is
deserving
the
death.
in
the
case
of
mitigating
evidence
like
penry’s
where
that
presented
by
these
petitioners,
the
evidence
may
function
as
a
two
edged
sword
because
it
may
diminish
the
defendant’s
blame
worthiness
for
the
crime
even
as
it
also
supports
an
affirmative
answer
to
one
or
both
of
the
special
issues.
limited
only
to
“the
deliberateness
in
future
dangerousness
special
issues”
the
jury
may
find
itself
faced
with
mitigating
evidence
such
as
childhood
abuse
or
neglect
or
mental
illness
which
simultaneously
suggests
that
a
defendant
will
be
dangerous
in
the
future
but
that
is
moral
culpability
for
the
crime
does
not
warrant
a
death
sentence.
rather
than
correctly
applying
the
reasoning
and
the
rules
set
fourth
in
penry,
the
texas
state
court
in
both
of
these
cases
held
that
the
texas
special
issues
did
provide
for
adequate
consideration
of
each
defendant’s
mitigating
evidence.
in
both
cases
this
conclusion
was
both
contrary
to
an
involved
and
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law
as
determine
by
this
court.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
each
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.

justice
