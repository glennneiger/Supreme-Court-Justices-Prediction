chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-11284,
abdul-kabir
vs.
quarterman,
and
05-11287,
brewer
versus
quarterman.
mr.
owen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
you
compare
that
evidence
with
the
evidence
in
penry
itself?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
these
are
closer
cases
than
penry,
i
think.
you'd
have
to
concede
that,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
brewer--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in,
in
brewer's
case,
it's,
quoting
the
record,
evidence
of
one
hospitalization
for
a
single
episode
of
nonpsychotic
major
depression.
so
it
was
certainly
opened
for
a
jury
to
determine
that
as
mitigating
and
not
aggravating
in
assessing
the
likelihood
that
there
was
going
to
be
further
violent
behavior.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
quite
a
bit
different
than
penry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
submission...
your
submission
is
that
every
juror
is,
or
a
reasonable
juror
is
going
to
look
at
that,
and
the
only
conclusion
that
they
are
going
to
draw
is
that
he
is
more
likely
to
be
violent
in
the
future?
as
opposed
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
mitigating
evidence
because
of
this,
that
he
should...
mercy
should
be
shown
to
him
in
light
of
all
of
this?
and
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
speculate
which
way
the
jury
is
going
to
go.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
was
in,
in
brewer.
now--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
was
no
reliance
or
no
similar
statement
by
the
prosecutor
in
abdul-kabir
or
mr.
cole's
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
do
we
have
different
results
in
these
two
consolidated
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the,
so
the...
but
my
point
is
the
absence
of
a
similar
prosecutorial
statement
in
the
cole
case
cuts
against
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
evidence
of
abatement
in
that
case
that
was
before
the
jury?
so
that
if
you
ask
them,
was
it
this
person's
fault
in
some
moral
sense,
that
might
affect
whether
they
wish
to
show
mercy?
and
if
you
ask
them
whether
he
is
going
to
grow
out
of
it,
they
may
well
say,
it
was
not
his
fault
because
of
this
brain
disorder
and
he
is
going
to
grow
out
of
it
and
that
was
the
evidence,
and
so
we
are
not
going
to
sentence
him
to
death.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
penry
we
didn't
establish
a
per
se
rule.
we
said
it
depends
upon
the
evidence.
it
depends
upon
the
instructions.
it
depends
upon
what
the
prosecutors
say.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
for
an
absolute
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not
no
reasonable
probability,
that's
not
the
standard.
the
standard
under
smith
is
whether
the
juries
can
consider
this
mitigating
evidence
in
some
manner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
owen.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we,
how
does
that
factor
in
on
the
issues
that
are
before
us,
the
weakness
of
the
mitigating
evidence?
in
what
way
are
we
supposed
to
assess
it?
we
don't
have
a
harmless
error
question
in
these
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
is
that
the
mitigating
evidence
was
not
precluded
by,
reasonable
consideration
was
not
precluded
by
the
instruction;
it
was
precluded
by
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
much
mitigating
evidence
to
begin
with?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
evidence,
i
take
it?
i
mean,
if
the
evidence
we
were
talking
about
was
biological
predisposition
to
violence,
that's
only
going
to
point
in
one
direction,
right?
i
mean,
if
the
evidence
is
isolated
incident,
incidents
of
depression,
the
idea
is
that,
well,
a
juror
might
look
at
that
and
say,
well,
that's
why
he
did
it,
and
that
since
it
was
isolated
it's
not
likely
to
come
up
again
and
therefore
it
can
be
regarded
as
mitigating
as
well
as
aggravating.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
when
you
get
into
this
evidence
of
child
abuse,
i
mean,
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
if
the
evidence
is
sufficient
so
that
anyone
looking
at
it
is
going
to
say,
he's
only
going
to
do
it
again,
or
if
someone
who's
looking
at
it
is
going
to
say,
well,
there's
an
excuse
for
it
and
he's
going
to
outgrow
it?
do
we
make
that
determination
in
every
case
based
on
the
particular
evidence
and
the
particular
arguments
that
counsel
made?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marshall.
you
mr.
owen,
have
you
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
old
was
brewer
at
that
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
argument
is
that
the
jury
hearing
this
evidence
in
light
of
all
the
instructions
will
only
conclude
that
the
evidence
shows
that
he
will
be
violent
again.
they
will
not
feel
that
they
can
take
it
into
account
in
any
way
to
determine
that
it's
a
situation
in
which
they
should
extend
mercy,
or
that,
i
guess
it
was,
i
get
the
cole
and
the
brewer
records
confused
here,
but
that
this,
the
cause
for
the
violence
will
abate
with,
with
age.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
that
in,
i
guess
in
brewer's
case
in
particular,
that
since
the
violence
was
caused
by
a
particular
bout
of
depression,
that
would
not
necessarily
recur.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
was
after...
i
guess
the
question
would
be
under
johnson,
whether
or
not
it
could
be
considered
in
some
manner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
owen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
05-11284,
abdul-kabir
v.
quarterman
in
the
consolidated
case
05-11287,
brewer
v.
quarterman.
