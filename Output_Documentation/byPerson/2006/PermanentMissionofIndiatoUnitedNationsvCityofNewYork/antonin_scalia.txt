justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
could
say
the
same
thing
if
the
mission
here
sold
its
property
to
someone
and
someone
was
claiming
the
right
to
possess
the
property
by
reason
of
the
sale.
and
you
could
come
up
and
say
this
is
simply,
simply
a
case
deciding
the,
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
the
sale
occurred
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
clearly
come
within
the
property
right
exception,
wouldn't
it?
you...
you
don't
go
one
step
back
to
look
at
the
transaction
that
created
the,
the
right
in
real
property
assuming
the
right
in
real
property
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that,
let's
assume
that
exception
didn't
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
had
nothing
but
the
real
estate
exception.
you
would
come
in
and
say
this
ultimately
relates
to
not
who
owns
the
real
estate
but
whether
there
was
a
proper
contract
or
not.
and
i...
frankly
we
wouldn't
accept
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
he
force
a
sale
of
the
property
to
collect
the
lien?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
this
action
does
not
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity.
but...
but
we
are
talking
about
what
the
nature
of
a
lien
is.
in
an
ordinary
case
cannot
a
lien
holder
force
a
sale
of
the
property
so
that
he
can
get
out
the
money
represented
by
his
lien?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
he
commence
an
action
to
foreclose
on
the
property
unless
he
in
any
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
has
an
interest
in
the
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
distinguishing
between
rights
in
property
and
interests
in
property?
i
would
think
that
every
right
in
property
is
an
interest
in
property
and
vice
versa.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
didn't
really
say
it.
i
mean
the
committee
said
it
to
be
precise.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
beyond
the
realm
of
the
conceivable,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
buying
land
that
you're
not
using
for
your
embassy
itself,
or
for
the
residence
of
the
ambassador,
but
buying
and
occupying
that
land
which
subjects
yourself
to
real
estate
taxes
on
that
land,
why
isn't
that
a
commercial
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
indian
embassy
could
own
real
estate
throughout
new
york
city,
which
it
wouldn't
have
to
pay
taxes
on?
or
if
it
didn't,
nothing
could
be
done
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
no.
you're
saying,
you're
saying
it's
not
a
commercial
activity.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
depends
upon
the
use,
and
the
use
in
this
case
is
not...
is
not
the
embassy
itself
or
the
residence
of
the
ambassador.
i
mean,
they
could
use
a
piece
of
property
for
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
buying
and
occupying
of
it
is
commercial
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
this
isn't
a
suit
for
the
taxes.
i
mean,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
suit
for
the
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
talking
about
a
declaration
as
to
the
interest
in
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
always
brought
up
to
answer
the
problem,
well,
you
know...
let
me
give
you
a
case
in
which
it
obviously
is
not
a
commercial
activity,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the
lien
interest
has
to
be
honored.
let's
suppose
that
there
is
an
american
who
is
very
friendly
to
and
sympathetic
with
the
indian
government,
and
gives
them
real
estate,
not
a
commercial
activity,
he
gives
them
real
estate
in
which
to
house
the
employees
in...
in
their
mission.
however,
he
retains
an
interest
in
that
real
estate.
he
retains
a
lien
on
the
real
estate,
to
have
money
paid
to
him
at
some
point.
he
is
not
willing
to
give
the
full
amount
of
the
property,
but
most
of
it.
and
he
retains
a
lien.
now,
under
your
theory,
that
lien
would
not
be
enforceable,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
enforceable
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
property
is
it
a
right
in
if
not
the
immovable
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
follows
that
immovable
property
and
when
the
immovable
property
disappears
the
lien
disappears.
you
know,
if
it's
blown
away
or
flooded,
it's
now
in
the
atlantic;
the
lien
is--
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
right
in
the
property.
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
owner's
point
of
view,
it
is
a
cloud
on
the
owner's
title
in
the
property.
it
affects
the
owner's
title.
even
if
you
assert
that
it
doesn't
give
any
title
to
the
lien
holder,
it
impairs
the
title
of
the
property
owner.
and
that's
all
that's
required,
as
i
read
the
title,
in
which
rights
in
immovable
property
are
an
issue,
and
here
the
question
is
whether
the,
the
mission's
right
to
the
property
is,
is
impaired
by
this
lien.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
affects
the
right
to
convey
the
property
free
and
clear,
which
is
an
enormous
right
that
goes
along
with
the
real
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
an
easement?
that
doesn't
involve
any
of
those
things.
you
can't
exclude
people
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cardozo,
before
you
go
any
further,
i
had
been
under
the
impression
from
your
brief
that
you're
not
trying
to
enforce
anything
against,
against
india
or
against
the
mission.
you
just
said
you
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
lien
is
a
valid
lien.
but,
but
here
it
is
in
your
complaint
you're
asking
for
foreclosure.
which,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
asked
for
it
to
scare
them?
was
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they'll
say
as
was
their
response
to
a
lot
of
hypotheticals,
the
commercial
act
exception
covers
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
just
say...
you
know,
if
you're
worried
about
the
malevolence
of
countries
to
make
all
sorts
of
stuff
liens,
i
guess
if
they're
malevolent
enough
they
can
make
all
sorts
of
stuff
easements,
which,
which
the
other
side
says
is
undoubtedly
a
property
interest.
so
they
could
say
that,
you
know,
if
you're
held
liable
the
court
can
give
you
an
easement
over
the
property
of,
of
the
defendant
worth
so
much
money.
and
that
would
undoubtedly
be
enforceable.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
states
that
don't?
isn't
it
fairly
standard?
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the...
the
european,
the
european
treaty
looks
at
it
from
the
other
side,
you're
saying.
it
looks
at
it
from
the
foreign
sovereign
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
obligations
arising
out
of
the
property
in
the
european
convention
include
the
obligation
to
pay
taxes,
property
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
says
what
explicitly?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
what,
what
do
you
get
out
of
this
case?
you've
withdrawn
your
claim
for
judgment
of
foreclosure.
what
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
it?
declaratory
judgment
that
they
owe
the
taxes?
i'm
not
sure
they
have
ever
contested
that
they
don't
owe
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
he
is
wrong
about
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
[laughter]
why
do
you
believe
him
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait
a
minute.
but
the...
the
embassy
has
rights
in
it
when
the
case
is
brought,
even
before
the
final
judgment.
so
you
know,
let's
give
the
devil
his
due.
it
would
be
a
case
in
which
rights
in
immovable
property
are
in
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
the
embassy
side
too
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
your
big
defense.
to
do
that
they
would
have
to
do
it
for
everybody'
they
would
have
to
do
it
for
joe
sixpack
as
well
as
for
the
embassy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
traffic
tickets?
they've
built
up.
you
know,
there's
$100,000
owing
in
traffic
tickets
by
some
embassy.
how
do
you
get
a
judgment
that
that
is
owing?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
use
even
the
foreign
aid
gimmick
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
we'll
have
to
start
paying
our
taxes
around
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
real
problem
for
us?
i
don't
think
so.
