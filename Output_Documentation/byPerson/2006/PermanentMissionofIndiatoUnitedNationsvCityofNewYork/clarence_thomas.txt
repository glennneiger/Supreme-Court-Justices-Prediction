first
case
i
have
is
the
permanent
mission
of
india,
et
al.
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
06-0134.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
for
several
years
new
york
city
has
levied
property
taxes
against
the
permanent
mission
of
india
to
the
united
states
and
the
mongolian
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
for
the
portions
of
their
new
york
buildings
used
to
house
lower
level
employees.
petitioners
have
refused
to
pay
those
taxes
by
operation
of
the
new
york
law
the
unpaid
taxes
converted
into
tax
liens
and
the
city
sought
a
declaration
in
state
court
that
the
tax
liens
were
valid.
petitioners
remove
to
federal
court
and
argued
that
they
were
immune
from
the
suits
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
the
district
court
disagreed
relying
on
the
acts
exception
to
immunity
for
“immovable
property”
which
provides
that
a
foreign
state
shall
not
be
immune
from
jurisdiction
in
any
case
in
which
“rights
and
immovable
property
situated
in
the
united
states
are
in
the
issue.”
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
an
action
seeking
a
declaration
of
the
validity
of
a
tax
lien
places
rights
and
immovable
property
in
the
issue.
contrary
to
petitioners’
position,
the
immovable
property
exception
does
not
expressly
limit
itself
to
cases
in
which
the
specific
right
at
issue
is
titled
ownership
or
possession.
rather
the
exception
focuses
more
broadly
on
rights
in
property.
at
the
time,
of
the
acts
adoption
in
1976,
black’s
law
dictionary
defined
a
lien
as
a
charge
or
security
or
incumbrance
upon
property.
incumbrance
in
turn
was
defined
as
“any
right
or
interest
in
land
which
may
subsist
in
another
to
the
diminution
of
its
value.”
the
most
recent
edition
of
black’s
similarly
defines
lien
as
a
“legal
right
or
interest
that
a
creditor
has
in
another’s
property.”
the
practical
effects
of
a
lien
are
consistent
with
these
definitions.
a
lien
on
real
property
runs
with
the
land
and
is
enforceable
against
subsequent
purchasers.
as
such
a
lien
has
an
immediate
adverse
effect
upon
the
amount
to
which
property
could
be
sold.
this
constitutes
a
direct
interference
with
the
property
and
inhibits
one
of
the
quintessential
rights
property
ownership
the
right
to
convey.
it
is
therefore
plain
that
a
suit
to
establish
the
validity
of
a
lien
implicates
rights
and
immovable
property.
two
well
recognized
and
related
purposes
of
the
act
adoption
of
the
restrictive
view
of
sovereign
immunity
and
codification
of
international
law
at
the
time
of
the
acts
enactment
support
our
reading
of
the
text.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
