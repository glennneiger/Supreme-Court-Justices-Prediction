justice
david
h.
souter
had
the
state
department
taken
a
position
at
that
point,
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
thing
they
would
have
to
do
i
suppose...
you've
mentioned
the
due
process
point...
would
be
to
perhaps
give
a
hearing
before
the
lien
was
declared
and
that
would
be
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
provided
that,
provided
notice
of
hearing
was
offered,
the
parking
ticket
lien
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
this
lien,
right...
the
hearing.
justice
david
h.
souter
may,
may
i
just
ask,
for
a
kind
of
a
footnote
kind
of
question?
i
mean
you
referred
again
to
the
text.
and
if
we
are
going
to
go
on
a
very
strict
reading
of
the
text
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
have
to
claim
a
right
in
property,
you
have
to
have
a
claim
in...
in
which
someone's
rights
in
immovable
property
are
in
issue.
so
whether
the,
the...
and
so
long
as
you
create
a
cloud
on
the
title,
however
that
cloud
is
classified,
it
puts
in
issue
the
title
of
the
named
title
holder,
so
that
the
debates
about
the
distinction
between
a
lien
and
easement
and
so
forth
is
essentially
irrelevant
as
long
as
it's
a
cloud
on
the
title.
if
we
are
going
to
be
that,
if
we
are
going
to
be
literal,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
only
the
case
that
the,
that
the
only
instances
in
which,
consistent
with
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
the
state
could
say
you
get
the
house,
would
be
instances
of
litigation
arising
out
of
commercial
activity?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
your
remaining
time.
with
respect
to
the
statute
that
authorizes
the,
the
charge
against
foreign
aid,
would
that
statute
have
any
application
except
either
in
a
commercial
case
or
a
case
like
yours?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
you
can
go
directly.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
practical
terms,
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
counterclaim,
the
foreign
aid
setoff
would
simply
apply
to
a
case
like
this,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say,
if
you
deny
all
the
statutes
you've
got
to--
