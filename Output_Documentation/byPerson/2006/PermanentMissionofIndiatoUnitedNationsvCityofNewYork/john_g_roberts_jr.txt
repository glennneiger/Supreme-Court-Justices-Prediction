chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-134,
the
permanent
mission
of
india
to
the
united
nations
et
al.
vs.
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
howley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
brings
up
the
basic
question
i
have,
is
this
a
question
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
even
if
you
have
different
rules
in
different
states,
there
is
going
to
be
one
rule
under
federal
law
under
1605(a)(4)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
just
may
be
more
sympathetic
to
india
and
mongolia
than
they
were
to
libya.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
howley.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
the
department
submitted
a
good
brief
on
this
issue,
but
in
1985.
what
do
you
do
with
all
the
arguments...
i'm
looking
at
page
12
of
your
brief
in
the
englewood
case,
which
you
argued
that
these
liens
were
interests
in
property.
are
those
arguments
no
longer
valid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
other
reasons
you
gave,
the
holder
of
a
lien
can
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
waste,
holders
of
liens
are
entitled
to
compensation
if
eminent
domain
is
exercised.
all
of
those
reasons
are
still
as
valid
as
they
were
in
1985.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
can
the,
how
can
the
lien
holder
then
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
waste
of
the
immovable
property?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cardozo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
over
tax
liens
or
claims?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
don't
go
that
far.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the...
the
convention
used
language
quite
different
than
that
was
used
by
congress.
so
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
that
international
practice
reflected
in
or
arising
out
of
the
convention
is
terribly
pertinent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
some
cases
they
used
language
directly
from
the
convention
and
in
this
case
they
didn't
so
it
seems
to
me
a
particularly
ill-advised
source
for
looking
for
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unless
new
york
law
is
changed
and
you
pass
something
saying
you
get
a
lien
on
property
if
you
have
delinquent
property,
parking
tickets.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
howley,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
two
cases.
