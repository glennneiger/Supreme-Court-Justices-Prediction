may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
another
jurisdiction
had
a
tax
system
which
was
just
a
little
different
from
new
york's
and
didn't
provide
for
a
lien
until
after
a
suit
had
been
brought
and
there
had
been
a
failure
to
pay
or
had
to
get
a
judgment
first.
on
that
case,
that
jurisdiction
could
not
enforce
this
tax
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
don't
you
think
it's
sort
of
a
strange
way
to
define
a
tax
immunity,
by...
by,
by
describing
the...
the
interest
in
immovable
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
but
the
basic
issue
in
final
analysis
is
whether
they
have
to
pay
their
taxes,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
they
have
to
pay
their
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
their
practice
draw
a
distinction
between
occupied
by
the
ambassador
himself
and
property
occupied
by
employees
of
the
embassy?
