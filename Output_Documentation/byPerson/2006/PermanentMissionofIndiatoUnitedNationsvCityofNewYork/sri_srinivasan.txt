mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
action
to
determine
whether
property
taxes
are
owed
is
not
a
case
in
which
rights
of
immovable
property
are
an
issue,
and
it's
not
transformed
into
such
a
case
by
attaching
a
lien,
and
recharacterizing
the
case
as
one
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
lien.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
picking
up,
justice
ginsburg,
on
the
question
you
just
asked,
because
i
think
it's
very
important
to
emphasize
that
under
respondent's
lien-based
theory,
that
theory
has
the
potential
largely
to
eviscerate
the
other
exceptions
in
the
fsia
in
the
following
sense:
respondent's
theory
doesn't
turn
in
any
way
on
the
nature
or
source
of
the
debt
that's
secured
by
the
lien.
so
under
respondent's
view,
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
a
debt
that
arises
out
of
property
taxes
is
largely
beside
the
point.
the
load
bearing
weight
of
that
theory
rests
entirely
on
the
supposed
effects
of
the
lien
on
the
property.
and
so
for
example,
you
could
have
a
case
in
which
a
commercial
activity
is
brought
into
play,
where
the
plaintiff
sues
a
foreign
sovereign
for
commercial
activity
that
occurs--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
the
lien
wouldn't
constitute
a
right
in
the
property,
and
that's
consistent
with
what...
the
way
this
court
has
always
described
liens.
as
we
point
out
in
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
the
court
has
said--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
lien
would
not
be
enforceable
against
a
foreign
sovereign,
because...
at
least
with
respect
to
the
immovable
property.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
are
only
talking
about--
the
immovable
property
exception.
and
with
respect
to
that
exception,
this
court
has
expounded
that
a
lien
on
land
constitutes
no
property
or
right
in
the
land
itself.
and
it
said
that
on
more
than
one
occasion.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
we,
of
course,
reviewed
our
position
in
that
case,
and
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
incorrect.
and
in
the
englewood
case,
that
argument
was
the
third
argument
in
the
brief.
the
first
two
arguments
in
the
brief
were
more
along
the
lines
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
let
me
try
to
take
up
some
of
those
in
order.
first
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
holders
of
a
lien
are
entitled
to
compensation
in
eminent
domain,
we
don't
take
issue
with
the
proposition
that
a
lien
is
property.
a
lien
is
property,
but
the
question
under
the
statute
is
whether
a
lien
confers
a
right
in
the
underlying
immovable
property.
and
so
in
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
it
may
just
be
that
just
compensation
is
owed
to
a
lien
holder
because
to
the
extent
that
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
takes
that
lien
there's
compensation
owed
for
that
property.
but
that
doesn't--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think--
justice
scalia:
but
otherwise
wherever
the
property
goes
the
lien
follows
it.
how
can
you
say
that
that's
not
an
interest
in
the
property?
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
right
in
property,
justice
scalia.
the
lien
is
a
species
of
property,
of
intangible
personal
property,
in
the
same
sense
that
a
cause
of
action
would
be,
because
after
all
what
a
lien
is
is
essentially
at
bottom
a
claim.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
a
lien
holder
can
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
waste,
but
it's
important
to
understand
what
interest
the
lien
holder
is
protecting
in
that
situation.
an
action
for
waste
by
a
lien
holder
is
to
protect
the
security
interest.
it's
different
from
an
action
for
waste
by
someone
who
holds
a
right
in
the
property.
and
new
york
law
appears
to
recognize
this
because
new
york
i
think
has
two
species
of
waste
actions,
one
brought
by
a
security
interest
holder
and
one
brought
by
the
holder
of
property
rights.
there's
a
case,
travelers
insurance,
in
which
the
second
circuit
reviewed
new
york
law
in
this
matter...
it's
at
14
f.
3d
114...
and
describes
how
there's
two
species
of
waste
actions
depending
on
which
sort
of
plaintiff
you
have
in
issue.
and
that
recognizes
that
the
interest,
if
you
will,
that
a
lien
holder
has
in
the
property,
is
different
from
a
right
in
the
property.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't...
you'd
have
to
ask
respondent's
counsel
exactly
what
they
mean
by--
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
respondents
have--
repeatedly
indicated
in
this
case
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
that
they
can't
foreclose
on
the
property
and
so
they've
abandoned
any
claim
for
foreclosure.
and
a
foreclosure
action
wouldn't
result
in
the
property
being
deeded
to
respondent.
it
would
be
put
up
for
sale
and
a
third
party
would
purchase
it.
so
i'm
not...
i
can't
tell
you
exactly
what
that
paragraph
means.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
liens
generally
constitute
clouds
on
title,
but
the
fact
that
something's
a
cloud
on
title
doesn't
make
it
a
right
in
the
property.
and
i
could
give
you
one
other
example.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
our
arguments
apply
equally
both
to
the
lien
holder
and
to
the
property
owner,
justice
scalia,
in
the
following
sense,
that
with
respect
to
both
of
them
a
lien...
the
lien
doesn't
affect
rights
of
possession,
it
doesn't
affect
the
right
to
exclude
others,
which
this
court
has
characterized
as
the
most
fundamental
of
property
rights.
it
doesn't
affect
the
right
to
receive
income
from
the
property.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
has
a
practical
consequence
on
conveyance
because
it,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
amounts
to
a
cloud
on
title.
but
there
are
other
instruments
that
result
in
a
cloud
on
title
but
that
wouldn't
be
considered
rights
in
property.
one
example
would
be
a
contract,
a
purchase
option
contract
to
purchase
property.
the
holder
of
a
purchase
option
wouldn't
be
considered
to
have
a
right
in
the
property
unless
and
until
the
option
was
exercised.
at
least
that's
the
general
rule,
even
though
the
purchase
contract
in
a
sense
constitutes
a
cloud
on
the
title
in
the
same
way
that
a
lien
might
constitute
a
lien
on
the
title.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i'm
not
aware
that
we
took
the
position
before
the
englewood
brief,
so
i
think
that
would
be
1985.
and
i
don't
think
we've
had
occasion
to
revisit
that
position
until
this
case.
and
let
me
point
out
with
respect
to
the
englewood
brief,
the
first
two
points
made
in
that
brief
were
along
the
lines
of
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning
in
this
case,
which
was
to
the
effect
that
a
statute
that
refers
to
a
right
in
immovable
property
encompasses
obligations
arising
out
of
immovable
property.
and
respondent
doesn't
attempt
to
defend
that
position,
but
that's
the
predicate
on
which
our
englewood
brief
rested.
and
so
we
think
there's
good
cause
for
us
to
revisit
our
position
from
that
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
a
lien
establishes
rights
in
property,
which
is
now
the
focus
of
respondent's
argument,
i
would
point
out
that
in
other
areas
of
the
law
the
court
has
looked
to
questions
concerning
whether
there
is
a
right
to
exclude
others,
whether
there
is
a
right
to
obtain
income
from
the
property,
whether
there
is
a
right
to
assert
possession
of
the
property.
that's,
for
example,
the
types
of
considerations
this
court
takes
into
account
in
the
tax
area
in
assessing
whether
a
federal
tax
lien
can
attach
to
a
property
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
right
to
property
at
stake.
and
we
think
the
same
sorts
of
consideration
should
inform
the
court's
assessment
of
the
immovable
property
exception
in
this
case.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
an
easement
i
think
would
qualify
as
a
right
in
property
because
at
least
your
standard
easement
would
provide
a
right
of
access
to
the
property
by
a
thoroughfare.
and
so
both
sides
would
be
affected
in
their
use
of
the
property
in
that
sense.
