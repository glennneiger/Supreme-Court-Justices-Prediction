g.

what
was
your
distinction
between
a
mortgage
and
a
tax
lien?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
think
they
can't
enforce
mortgage
under
this?
that
is
to
say
the
bank
can't;
it's
not
an
interest
of
property
in
mortgage?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's,
that's
where
it's
hard
for
me
because
a
purchase
money
mortgage,
you
sell
the
real
estate.
ordinary
secured
interest
in
mortgage
is
secured
interest
by
a
lender
is
normally
viewed
as
an
interest
in
property,
i
think.
i
mean
is
there,
is
there
any
law
anywhere
that
says
that
isn't
an
interest
in
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
take
it
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
the
history
of
the
world
you'll
tell
me
where
a
lender
or
bank
or
anybody
who
loaned
money
to
build
an
embassy
has
ever
brought
a
case
against
the
owner
of
the
embassy,
the
sovereign,
and
won
under
anything
like
this
exception,
because
they
can't
sue
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ever.
and
there
is
none
the
other
way,
where
they
said
you
couldn't
sue
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
do
people
lend
money
to
build
embassies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
did
it
work
before
1605
was
passed,
how
did
they
used
to
build,
in
the
19th
century,
embassies,
if
you
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
paragraph
3
just
after
paragraph
2
in
the
complaint?
paragraph
3
asks
the
court
to
bar
and
forever
foreclose
the
defendants
from
all
right,
interest,
claim,
etcetera
in
the
parcel.
well,
what
about
that?
what
they're
asking,
i
just
heard
it.
so
what's
the
answer
to
that?
they
seem
to
be
saying,
we
have
the
right
to
the
parcel,
you
the
defendant
have
no
right
to
the
parcel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
did
in
part,
so
he
can
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
that
actually
is
bothering
me
with
your
side
of
the
case
which
i
find
difficult
is,
suppose
i
accept
this
principle
that
you
have.
all
right,
it
seems
to
me
anything
at
all
can
be
reduced
to
a
lien,
any
judgment,
at
least
certainly
slip
and
fall
cases
and
you
didn't
keep
the
ice
up
in
front
and
i
want
$4
million
damages
plus
300
million
in
punitives
and
where
it
is
i
have
a
lien
against
the
embassy
here.
and
i
can't
think
of
a
distinction
once
i
go
down
your
road.
i
mean,
he
at
least
has
an
absolute
distinction
which
i
can
see,
but
once
i
go
down
your
road
where
is
the
stopping
place?
what's
the
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
imagining
a
city
or
belarus
or
someplace
where
what
they
do
is
they
say
slip
and
fall
on
ice...
you
know,
you
get
a
lien
against
the
property
prior
to...
okay.
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
imagine
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
a
range
of
subject
matters.
so
i'm
looking
to
what
the
stopping
place
is
once
i
start
down
your
road.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
have
my
question
because
i'm
not
world
about
malevolence,
is
that
i
don't
carry
around
in
my
head
all
of
the
possible
things
that
might
be
liens
against
property.
and
so
maybe
my
imagination
is
wrong,
but
i
want
to
know
are
you
are
arguing
that
every
lien
against
the
property
is
in
fact
a
right
in
property
which
allows
a
lawsuit,
or
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
some
distinction
between
some
and
the
other.
and
i
noticed
that
the
restatements
and
others
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
whether
the
lien
in
question
grows
out
of
the
property
or
it
doesn't
grow
out
of
the
property,
which
i
find
possibly
hard
to
work
with
and
so
i
want
to
know
how
you
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i...
can
i
can
ask
you
to
go
back
for
a
second
to
where
i'm
getting
myself
into
a
muddle
here.
i'm
still
now
being
very,
very
literal.
i
think
you're
very
literal
and
you
say
it
says,
a
case
in
which
is
involved
rights
to
property.
and
you
say,
but
this
is
a
right
to
property
in
this
case;
if
i
win
this
case
then
i
have
a
right
to
sell
that
house.
therefore,
i
have
a
right
in
property.
now,
if
that's
the
reasoning
why
doesn't
that
apply
to
every
case
where
a
state
might
say
if
you
win
this
case
you
can
sell
his
house?
i
mean,
i
can
easily
imagine
a
tort
case,
a
contract
case
where
a
state
would
say,
you
win,
you
can
sell
their
house
to
collect
the
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
still
back
in
a
different
route
at
where
i'm
having
the
problem,
which
is
a
problem
of
distinguishing
in
principle
between
either
your
absolute
principle,
"do
it",
his
absolute
principle,
"don't
do
it",
or
something
in
the
middle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
hypothetical
was
doing
away
with
the
prejudgment
lien.
i
would
say
the
exact
same
words
apply
with
just
as
much
force
if
there
is
no
prejudgment
lien
because
a
suit
without
a
lien
the
state
were
to
say,
you
win
this
tort
claim,
you
can
go
sell
this
property
to
collect
the
judgment,
is
a
suit
in
which
there
is
at
issue
your
right
to
sell
his
property,
just
as
there
is
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you?
