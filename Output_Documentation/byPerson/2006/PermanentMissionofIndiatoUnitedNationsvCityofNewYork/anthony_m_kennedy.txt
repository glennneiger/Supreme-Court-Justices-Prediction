justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
point
in
some
jurisdictions
and
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
about
new
york,
i
had
thought
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
tax
liens
have
a
superior
status
to
other
liens
in
that
they
are
an,
an
interest
or
an
estate
in
the
property
as
opposed
to
an
attachment.
is
it
not
true?
and
i
don't,
and
i'm
not
talking
just
about
order
of
priority
for
creditors.
i'm
talking
about
the
superiority
insofar
as
being
or
not
being
an
interest
in
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
new
york
law
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
had...
i
had
thought
that
it
is
an
estate
in
land
in
at
least
some
jurisdictions.
and
justice
breyer
was
asking
about
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
there
are
liens...
there
are
liens
and
liens.
there
are
different
kinds
of
liens.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
commercial
activity
for
new
york
to
say,
we
provide
garbage
services,
electric
services,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
pay
fees
and
new
york
taxes.
suppose
new
york
doesn't
have
fees.
suppose
they
say,
we'll
just
do
this
out
of
our
property
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
argument
that
it
was
an
interest
in
property.
the
brief
was
very
clear
that
it
is
an
interest
in
property,
and
that
a
tax
lien
is
almost
sui
generis,
in
that
it
is
an
estate
in
the
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
survives
bona
fide...
it
survives
bona
fide
purchaser
without
notice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
under
new
york
law
does
property,
do
property
tax
liens
have
some
superior
status?
are
they
distinct
under
new
york
law
from
other
liens?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
reference
to
priority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
had
thought
they
had
a
greater
priority
and
that
they
even
survived
purchase
from
bona
fide
sellers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
the
vienna
convention?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
european
convention.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now...
now
i
take
it
you
under
new
york
law
and
the
law
of
most
jurisdictions,
the
tax
lien
becomes
a
lien
against
the
property
before
any
judicial
proceedings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
because
they
are
unpaid.
and
this
is
probably
a
question
more
for
them
than
for
you,
but
as
you
understand
their
position,
if
you
put
a
lien
on
the
property
for
unpaid
taxes,
are
they
entitled
to
demand
its
removal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
of
course
they
can
under
their
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
can
they
demand
that
that
lien
be
released--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no.
--because
it
violates
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act?
is
it
their
position
that
you
have
no
right
at
all
even
to
notice
a
lien
against
the
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
to
follow
from
what
they're
saying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
hypothetical
is
can
they
demand
that
the
lien
be
removed
solely
because
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
with
reference
to
the
offset
of
foreign
aid,
could
that
offset
be
made
under
the
controlling
statutes
just
based
on
your
lien,
or
do
you
have
to
have
a
judgment
first?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
it's
improper
even
to
notice
the
property
with
the
lien?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
you
owe
the
taxes.
