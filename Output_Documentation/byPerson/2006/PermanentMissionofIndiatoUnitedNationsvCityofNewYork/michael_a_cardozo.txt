mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
reasons
this
case
puts
in
issue
rights
in
immovable
property:
first,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute;
second,
the
statute's
purpose
and
legislative
history;
and
third,
international
practice
as
it
existed
in
1976.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
justice
scalia,
we
know
that
section
1610
would
preclude
us
from
actually
foreclosing.
we're
not
allowed
to
do
that.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
no.
we
do
want,
as
the
discussion
preceding
me
highlighted,
we
do
want
to
get
in
and
take
what
we
think
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
our
property.
but
we
can't.
we
understand
that.
so
what
we're,
what
we're
saying
in
our
complaint
in
paragraph
3,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
is
we
would
like
to
bar
them
from
holding
title.
but
as
we
quickly
conceded
as
soon
as
we
filed
the
action,
we
can't
foreclose
because
of
the
provisions
of
section
1610.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
fact
that
we
can't
foreclose
doesn't
mean
that
we
don't
have
a
right
in
property.
let
me
give
you
a
very
good
illustration.
if
there
is
a
possessory
dispute,
someone,
an
embassy,
rented
premises
and
agreed
that
if
they
didn't
pay
the
rent
they
would
lose
their
ability
to
continue
to
occupy
the
premises
and
they
failed
to
pay
rent,
that's
a
title
dispute.
the
person
who
rented
the
property
would
bring
a
suit
saying:
i
have
a
right
to
get
back
into
my
property
and
there
is
clearly
a
right
in
property
in
section
1605.
i
can't
believe
that
congress
said,
that
congress
intended
to
say,
well,
you
can
bring
an
action
for
nonpayment
of
rent
and
seek
possession
except
for
1610,
that's
okay.
there's
jurisdiction
in
an
action
for
rent,
but
if
you
want
possession
of
property
because
you
haven't
paid
your
taxes,
and
of
course
you
still
can't
foreclose,
there's
no
jurisdiction.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
your
honor,
it
may
or
may
not
cover
the
commercial
act
exception.
and
going
back
to
a
question
that
justice
breyer
asked,
there
are,
there
are
cases,
not
in
the
united
states,
but...
and
we're
citing
some
of
them
in
footnote
24
in
the
red
brief...
that
when
someone,
not
the
commercial
property
exception,
someone
lent
money
to,
to
build
an
embassy
and
they
defaulted
on
the
mortgage,
the
german
court
said
jurisdiction.
it's
not
a
question
of
enforcement,
but
jurisdiction.
the
reason
for
this
is
if
you
first
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
only
certain
kinds
of
rights.
it
says
all
rights
in
property
if
they're
in
issue.
we
believe
that
we
have
a
right
in
the
indian
and
mongolia
premises.
we--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--let
me
try,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
if
there
was
a
judgment
on
that
hypothetical
tort
action
that
you
just
mentioned,
if
there
were
a
judgment
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
judgment
in
the
first
place
unless
you
had
originally
come
within--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
and
the
stopping
place
i
think
is
a
federalism
concept
and
a
due
process
concept,
because
as
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases,
there's
a
real
due
process
question
if
liens
are
created
with
no
concern
about
the
effect
on
the
defendant.
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
interest
of
the
so-called
plaintiff
and
you
have
to
find
whether
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
lien
and
the
underlying
claim.
now--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--justice
scalia,
they
did
say
that
and
certainly
if
an
easement
is
a
right
in
property,
either
because
of
the
hypothetical
you
just
gave
or
a
traditional
easement,
there
is
nothing
different
with
a
tax
lien.
in
fact,
a
tax
lien
is
a
much
greater
interest.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
and
what
i
see,
justice
breyer,
is
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
cases
in
this
court
such
as
connecticut
against
doehr
and
the
other
cases
which
put
limits,
the
constitutional
limits
on
liens,
of
course
if
a
state
passed
a
statute
that
runs
afoul
of
the
various
due
process
concerns
that
this
court
has
articulated
that
is
certainly
one
check
that
we
have.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
would
be
a
hard
question,
but
if
it
does
not
run
afoul
of
the
constitutional
concerns
that
i
just
articulated
and
it
was
a
lien
applicable
not
just
of
course
to
foreign
sovereigns,
but
to
any
unpaid
parking
ticket--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--i
think
that
then
that
would
come
within
the
immovable
property
exception.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i
think,
i
think
it
certainly
would,
justice
souter,
if
in
fact
there
was
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i
think
that's
right.
and
so--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--well,
they're...
as
tax
liens
you
may
get
into
a
priority
fight
in
a
bankruptcy
context.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
have
any
different
lien,
any
different
status,
although
my
colleague
corrects
me
and
says
that
yes,
tax
liens...
tax
liens
do
have
in
certain
circumstances
a
greater
priority.
it's
hard
to
think
through
exactly
where
that
issue
would
be.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that
certainly,
that
is
certainly
true
and
a
property...
excuse
me
for
interrupting...
a
tax
lien
would
run
forever
with
no
time
limit,
for
example,
whereas
a
mechanics
lien
has
a
statutory
time
on
it.
if
you
got
into
a
dispute
about
those
two
liens
obviously
the
tax
lien
would
have...
would
have
priority.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
well,
we
start
off
with
the
statutory
language
and
the
statutory
language
says
right
in
property.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
abstract
right
to
tax.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
the
ultimate
substance...
underlying
substantive
issue
is
that
but...
and
of
course,
the
state
department
even
today
says
these
taxes
should
be
paid.
but
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
right
in
property.
and
so
if
you
just...
if
you
don't
create
a
lien,
if
a
particular
state
did
not
create
a
lien,
that
would
not
give
you
the
right,
which
is
what
the
statute,
statutory
language
says.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i
believe...
i
believe
it
is
fairly
standard,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
i...
there
may
be
one
out
of
50
states
that,
that
don't
say
this.
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--i,
i
agree
with
that.
and
here
today
the
right
that
india
and
mongolia
claim
in
their
property
is
in
issue,
because
we
say
you
do
not
have
the
full
right
to
your
property
and
if
this
lien
runs
long
enough,
it's
going
to
wipe
out
the
value
of
their
property
completely.
and
all
the
statute,
the
statute
doesn't
say
as
the
european
convention
says
the
foreign
sovereign's
right
in
property.
the
statute
says
either...
in
effect,
either
side's
right
in
property.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
and
i
think
we
can
also
get
a
great
deal
of
help
by
looking--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--the
european
convention
phrased
differently
looks
at
it
from
both
sides,
justice
scalia,
which
is
why
they
needed
the
words
obligation.
if
you
look
at
article
9
of
the
european
convention
it
first
talks
about
the
foreign
sovereign's
right
or
interest
in
property,
and
then
it
says
"or
the
foreign
sovereign's
obligations
arising
out
of
that
property.
"
that's
a
different
phrase
than
the
fsia
which
doesn't
use
the
word
foreign
sovereign;
it
says
"its"
rights
in
property
have
to
be
an
issue.
so
you
didn't
need
to
encompass
all
the
language
of
the
european
convention.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
it
would
include
a
controversy
over
that
absolutely.
and
let,
let
me
talk
about
the
international
practice
because
we
should
take
a
look
at
international
practice
to...
to
guide
us.
what
was
the
practice
in
1976?
well,
first
of
all
we
know
that
the
restatement
second
and
comment
in
paragraph
68
says
disputes
over
rights
or
interest
in
property.
and
the
restatement
third,
which
was
concededly
a
few
years
after
the
1976
adoption
of
the
statute,
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
it
says
it
explicitly.
but
where
did
the
restatement--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--says
that
there
is
jurisdiction
over
tax
claim.
section
455
of...
of
restatement
third.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
over
tax
claims.
excuse
me,
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that...
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
because
we
believe
we,
as
a...
we
have
a
right
in
property
arising
from
the
lien.
now
let's
look
at
the
foreign
cases
before
we
get
to
the
european
convention
and
we
cite
a
number
of
them
in
footnote
24.
there
is
for
example
the
case
i
referred
to
in
response
to
justice
breyer,
a
suit
over
a
mortgage.
a
suit
over
a
mortgage.
it's
not
the
commercial
exception;
a
suit
over
a
mortgage.
there
is
a
case
in
england
in
1975
which
analyzes
broadly
what's
the
meaning
of
this
real
property
exception.
and
that
case
in
england
which
we
cite
says
a
security
interest,
a
suit
over
security
interest
for
a
mortgage,
there
is
jurisdiction
within
the
immovable
property
exception.
there
is
a
large
number
of
cases.
you
look
at
the
harvard
review
of
1932,
the
status
of
the
law
at
that
time,
extensive
review
of
all
the
relevant
cases,
says
the
same
thing.
then
that
brings
us
to
the
european
convention
which
was
adopted
shortly
before
the
fsia
and
which
the
state
department
told
congress
was
consistent
with
the
fsia.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
pardon
me?
no,
the
european
convention.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
right.
and
the
european
convention
in
article
9
as
i
say
has
a
very
broad
immovable
property
exception.
i'm
not
looking
just
at
the
language.
i'm
looking
at
what
does
this
convention
reflect
as
far
as
international
practice
was
at
the
time?
and
that
practice
at
the
time
as
reflected
by
the
convention,
as
reflected
by
these
cases,
all
say
that
there
is
a
very
broad
immovable
property
exception
that
should
cover
this
kind
of
dispute.
now
let
me
make
one,
one
or
two
final
points.
if
this--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--i'm
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
talking
just
about
the
language.
i'm
talking
about
the
european,
the
international
practice
as
reflected
by
that
convention
because
the
1976
legislative
history
of
the
fsia
says
we
are
trying
to
conform
united
states
practice
into
the,
the
practice
that
is
followed
internationally.
and
i--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--then
i
would
say
where
did
they
get
that
source
from?
and
that's
where
i
cite
the,
first
the
international
cases
themselves
which
reflect
as
of
1976
the
same
philosophy
reflected
by
the
european
convention.
there
is
no
question
that
the
wording
is
different.
i'm
not,
i'm
not
disputing
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
wording
conveys
an
intent
from
the
international
point
of
view
to
have
the
broad
parameters
of
an
international,
of
an
immovable
property
exception
and
that
was
consistent
with
the
international
cases
that
have
been
decided
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
as
a
substantive
matter,
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
of
course
yes.
because
the
vienna
convention
in
article
20...
23
says
that
the
premises
of...
of
the
mission
may
not
be,
may
not
be
taxed.
and
then
you
look
at
article
1
to
look
at
what
is
the
meaning
of
premises
of
the
mission
and
they
talk
about
where
the
business
of
the
mission
is
conducted,
or
where
the
ambassador
resides.
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
rest
of
the
employees.
and
since
1952,
the
state
department
even
before
the
vienna
convention
and
subsequent
has
been
advising
missions
in
new
york,
it's
on
their
web
site
today
that
they
must
pay
taxes
on
staff
housing.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
oh
yes
i
think
if
you
look,
if
you
look
at
the
petitioners'
brief
i
think
they
do
contest
that
they,
that
they
have
to
pay
the
tax.
but
what
we'll
get
out
of
this
is
the
following.
first
of
all,
start
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
says
you
can
bring
an
action
in
this
jurisdiction
even
if
you
can't
execute.
we
have
the
state
department
telling
us,
the
solicitor
general
telling
us
in
their
briefs,
footnote
17,
that
countries
pay
lawful
taxes.
so
if
we
can
get,
if
we
can
proceed
to
judgment
and
get
that,
and
get
that
declaration,
we
believe
based
upon
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
they
will
pay
their
taxes.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
in
addition--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--and
the...
the
reason
i
believe
him
about
that
is
that
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
says
if
you
don't
pay
your
taxes
reflected
by
a
judgment,
whatever
the
amount
of
that
tax
is,
you're
going
to
lose
1110
percent
of
your
foreign
aid.
and
so
i
believe
we
are
going
to
get
a
lot
out
of
that.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
and--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--and
i
think
the
something
in
the
middle,
justice
breyer,
is
if
you're
talking
about
a
prejudgment
lien
which
i
think
is
your
hypothetical.
it's--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--but
justice,
justice
breyer,
in
that
hypothetical,
you
don't
have
a
right
in
property
until
you
win
the
case.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
we
have,
we
have
a,
there
is
an
in
issue
today
our
right
to
property
and
i
believe
that
that
is
a
distinction
and
i
believe
also...
and
of
critical
importance.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
and
if--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--yes.
and
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
the
embassy
side
under
my
theory,
their
right...
under
my
lien
their
rights
are
an
issue
today.
and
under
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
if
it
meets
the
other
due
process
concerns
which
i
think
under
that
hypothetical
would
raise
a
number
of
interesting
ones--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
yes.
that
is...
that
is...
that
is
correct.
because
it's
only
in
the
commercial
activities
exception
can
you
execute
and
then
only
in
certain
limited
circumstances--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--and
you
can
execute
unless
the
premises
are
not
being
used
for
the
purposes
of
the
mission.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
of
course
they
can.
and
in
fact
the
republic
of
argentina
case--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--no.
they
can
bring
an
action
to
quiet
title.
they
can
bring
an
action--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
they
can
demand
it.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
well,
i
haven't
heard
their
articulation
of
that
position,
but
they
certainly
could
write--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--i
think
it
may.
i
think
they
certainly
have
a
right
to
ask
us
to
reconsider
and
make
the
various
arguments
on
the
merits
to
us.
there
are
cases
preceding
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
where
a
country
felt
the
lien
was
invalid
and
brought
a
lawsuit.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
they
could
demand
that,
but
i
don't
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
answers
the
underlying
substantive
question.
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
vienna
convention
as
well
as
new
york
law
to
answer
that
question,
because
all
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
talking
about
is
the
jurisdictional
issue,
not
the
substantive
issue.
and
let
me
just
point
out
that
if
we,
if
we
can't
bring
this
lawsuit
to
have,
to
try
to
foreclose
or
at
least
to
have
a
declaration
of
our
rights,
this
lawsuit
can't
be
brought
anywhere.
no
place
in
the
world
can
new
york
city
have
a
conclusion
as
to
who
owns
this
property.
that
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
underlying
immovable
property
exception
and
the
local
action
rule,
which
says
that
land...
that
a
sovereign
has
a
prim
evil
interest
in
its
land,
it
has
the
right
to
adjudicate
its
property.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
no.
the
statute
talks
about
a
judgment.
it
can't
just
be
that.
so
finally,
even
though
we
cannot
execute
on
our
property...
on
the
judgment,
it
has
a
major
impact,
this
case
has
a
major
impact
on
what
we
can
do.
if
we
can't
do
it
there's
no
other
place
for
our
problems
to
be
resolved.
i
urge
that
the
decision
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
theoretically
it
would
have
an
application
in
a
counterclaim
situation
as
well--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--justice
souter.
i
think
those
are
the
three
things.
of
course,
you
don't
need
that
statute
for
the
commercial
exception
because
you
can
execute.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
right.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that's
right.
and
justice
souter,
while
certainly
the
congress
that
passed
those
statutes
was
not
the
congress
that
passed
the
fsia,
there
is,
certainly
should
be
an
effort
to
harmonize
what
the
congress
has
done.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that
is
obviously
the
way
to
reconcile
these
statutes.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
you
can't
get
a
judgment
that
that
is
owing.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
not
unless,
unless
the
statute
is
changed,
justice
scalia,
which
we
have
from
time
to
time
tried
to
persuade
congress
to
do.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
that
is
right,
and
that
would
get
us
right
back
into
the--
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
cardozo
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
does.
it
relates
to
unpaid
property,
unpaid
property
taxes.
it
doesn't
apply
to
unpaid
parking
tickets.
thank
you
very
much.
