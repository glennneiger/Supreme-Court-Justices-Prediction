but
what
new
york
is
seeking
is
an
interest
in
land
and
a
lien
is
an
interest
in
the
land.
it
runs
with
the
land,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
counterclaim
sounds
to
me
very
much
like
it
comes
straight
out
of
the
federal
rules,
not
out
of
any
convention.
it's
the
same
transaction
and
occurrence,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
exactly
what
it
says
in
the
federal
rules
about
compulsory--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
nothing
vague
about
the
state
department's
brief
in
the
englewood
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
anyway,
at
a
time
closer
to
the
passage
of
the
act,
the
state
department
was
taking
the
position
that
a
lien
was
an
interest
in
land.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
reality,
you
will
never
get
there,
because
the
vienna
convention
deals
with
the
substantive
liability...
you're
talking
about
jurisdiction.
on
your
theory,
you
would
never
get
to
the
fee
for
picking
up
the
garbage,
because
you
wouldn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
commercial
activity,
it's
applied
to
that
same
building
that
you
say
can't
be...
it
can't
be
any
suit
for
taxes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even...
even
if
this,
the
building
were
only
the
mission
and
the
representative,
the
minister
to
the
u.n.,
even
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
water
of
a
municipal
service,
garbage
collection,
could
be
charged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
the
city.
not
a
private
company,
the
city
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
easily
say
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
to
the
property
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
a
very
practical
way,
you're
expressing
that
right
means
ownership
means
ownership.
but
the
title
is
certainly
impaired
by
this
lien.
india
could
not
turn
around
and
sell
it
to
anyone
without
doing
something
to
discharge
the,
lien
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
title
is
certainly
clouded
by
this
lien.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
did
the
united
states
take
the
opposite
position
and
when
did
it
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
did
the
united
states
adhere
to
the
position
that's
reflect
in
the
englewood
brief
and
when
did
it
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
parking
ticket
that
your
colleague
raised,
that
new
york
would
make
a
parking
ticket
a
lien,
unpaid
parking
ticket
a
lien
on
all,
all
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
foreign
aid--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
the
federal,
the
100
percent
withholding,
relates
to
taxes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
taxes,
not
for
parking
tickets
or
anything
else.
