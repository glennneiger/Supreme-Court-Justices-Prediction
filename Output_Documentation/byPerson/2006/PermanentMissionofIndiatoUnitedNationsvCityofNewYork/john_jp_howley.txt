mr.
john
j.p.
howley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
tax
enforcement
lawsuits.
if
jurisdiction
existed,
the
only
issue
a
court
would
decide
is
whether
a
tax
is
owed.
this
type
of
case
did
not
fall
within
any
real
property
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
before
congress
passed
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
section
1605(a)(4)
of
that
act
did
not
create
a
new
exception
where
none
had
otherwise
existed.
congress
chose--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--uh--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--actually,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
if
you
had
a
dispute
over
what
happened
with
the
sale
of
property
that
it
would
fall
within
the
based
upon
commercial
activities
exception
in
1605(a)(2).
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
okay.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
no.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case
from
what
we
have
here
because
in
that
case
the
issue
for
the
court
to
decide
is
which
of
the
parties
has
the
right,
has
the
title
in
the
real
property.
that
is
not
in
issue
here.
the
city
of
new
york
does
not
seek
title
in
this
property.
their
action
is
to
declare
the
validity
of
a
tax
lien
and
the
issue
in
an
action
to
declare
the
validity
of
a
tax
lien
is
whether
the
tax
is
owed
and
whether
it
has
been
paid.
that
is
the
issue
that's
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i...
i...
yes.
i
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
similarities
between
a
lien
and
a
right
in
property.
for
example,
that
it
runs
with
the
land.
but
there
are
dissimilarities
that
are
far
more
numerous
and
far
more
significant.
unlike
rights
and
property
a
lien
does
not
give
the
lien
holder
any
right
to
own,
access,
possess,
cross
over,
collect
rents
from,
exclude
or
any
other
right
in
the
property.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
this
action
does
not.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
yes.
if
the
lien
holder
commences
an
action
to
foreclose
on
the
property,
then
a
consequence
of
that
could
be
the
sale
of
the
property.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i
do
not
dispute
that
a
lien
holder
has
an
interest,
a
security
interest
in
the
property.
but
congress
did
not
write
in
section
1605(a)(4)
all
interests
that
are
in
issue
in
property.
congress
in
fact
had
the
european
convention
in
front
of
it
which
said
rights,
interests
and
obligations
in
property.
congress
chose
language
from
the
european
convention
elsewhere
but
did
not
choose
that
language
here.
congress
said
only
rights
in
property.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
no.
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
there...
there...
there
has
to
be
a
reason
why
congress
chose
language
verbatim
from
the
european
convention
in
other
sections
of
the
statute
such
as
the
counterclaim
exception,
but
in
this
exception
said
we
are
not
taking
interest
and
obligations
from
the
european
convention,
we
are
only
saying
rights.
and
this
court--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes.
yes.
the,
the
counterclaim
exception--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes,
but
congress
said,
in
the
house
report
congress
refers
to
the
european
convention
as
the
source
for
the
counterclaim
exception
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
so
congress
said
we
are
taking
this
from
the
european
convention.
this...
this
language
also--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes,
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i
don't
think
there
is
a
distinguished,
a
distinction
between
a
mortgage
and
a
tax
lien.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
no.
but
congress,
congress
passed
another
exception
here,
1605(a)(2)
that
said
actions
based
upon
commercial
activity
provide
an
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
and
these
exceptions
have
to
be
read
together.
they
have
to
be
read--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--well,
actually
there
is.
in
the,
in...
when
the
united
states
waived
immunity
from
suit
concerning
real
property
it
limited
its
waivers
to
liens
and
mortgages
and
not
rights
in
property.
and
so
there
has
been
distinctions
made
between
mortgage
liens
and
liens
on
the
one
hand
and
rights
in
property
on
the
other.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
yes.
it
is
superior
to
other
types
of
liens.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
it
is
an
interest,
a
security
interest
in
the
property,
but
it
is
not
a
right
in
the
estate
of
the
property,
and
it
doesn't
give
any
type
of
the
possession
and
ownership
rights
that
every
other
right
in
property
gives.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
yes,
there
is.
and
we
have
cited
it
in
our
brief.
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
distinguish
it,
because
a
court
of
claims
jurisdictional
act
was
passed
that
deemed
a
lien
an
interest
in
property
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
in
the
new
york
court
of
claims
but
the
essential
nature
of
a
lien
is
not,
under
new
york
law,
a
right
in
the
estate.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
there
appears
to
be
in
different
jurisdictions,
different
treatments
of
liens.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
this
court
has
held--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes,
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
this
court
held
in
saudi
arabia
against
nelson
and
argentina
against
weltover
that
the
exception
language...
they
are
dealing
with
the
commercial
activities
exception...
must
have
the
meaning
that
congress
understood
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
to
require
at
the
time
it
passed
the
statute.
and
so
when
defining
what
a
right
in
immovable
property
in
issue
means,
we
have
to
give
that
the
meaning
that
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
required
at
the
time
in
1976.
and
in
1976,
no
court
here
in
the
united
states
or
anywhere
in
the
world
had
held
that
sovereign
immunity
was
abrogated
merely
by
having
a
statutory
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
there
is...
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
is
vague
language
in
the
testimony
in
the
house
report,
general
language
about
1605(a)(4)
relating
to
real
property
disputes,
but
there
is
not
precise
language
about
whether
liens
are
or
liens
are
not--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--no,
there
is
not,
justice
ginsburg.
but
they
lost
in
englewood.
they
lost
and
the
englewood
court
relied
on
a
d.c.
circuit
decision.
and
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
will
say
that
they
have
reconsidered
their
position,
they
have
reconsidered
article
29
of
the
european
convention,
which
they
relied
on
heavily
in
the
englewood
brief.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
they
have
since
decided
that
that
position
was
wrong.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
it's
not
beyond
the
realm
of
the
conceivable.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
not
that
we're
aware
of,
and
not
that
we've
seen--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
because
once
you
lend
money
and
you
engage
in
commercial
activity,
if
the
claim
is
based
upon
the
commercial
activity,
congress
had
provided
a
separate
section,
1605(a)(2)
that
protects
the
american
citizen
who
has
lent
money
to
an
embassy.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i
don't
know
about
19th
century
embassies.
i
do
know
that
since
the
tate
letter,
which
predates
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
there
has
been
a
commercial
activity
exception
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
this
court
held
in
saudi
arabia
against
nelson
that
it's
not
just
engaged
in,
related
to
commercial
activity,
but
the
cause
of
action,
the
claim
has
to
be
based
upon
commercial
activity.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
it
depends
on
the
use
they
put
that
property
to.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
the
mere
ownership
of
the
land
is
not--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--as
long
as
it's
not
commercial
activity,
it
would
not
be
taxed
and--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--well,
the
buying
of
it,
if
the
claim
is
based
upon
the
buying
of
the
property,
under
saudi
arabia
against
nelson,
then
the
commercial
activities
exception
would
apply.
but
the
mere
ownership
of
the
property
is
not
commercial
activity.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
separate
and
apart
from
the
jurisdictional
issue,
the
vienna
conventions
do
say
that
if
there
are
fees
for
services
provided,
such
as
garbage
collection,
water,
those
types
of
services,
then
there
is
no
immunity
from
the
fees
for
those
services.
and
those
fees
should
be
paid.
the
separate
issue
of
whether
that's
commercial
activity,
it
may
be.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
city
provides
a
service
such
as
water,
or
a
private
entity
provides
a
service
such
as
water.
that
may
be
commercial
activity.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
no,
that
does
not...
on
the
substantive
issue
of
whether
it's
immune
under
the
foreign...
under
the
vienna
conventions,
a
tax
is
immune.
they
are
immune
from
a
tax,
but
they're
not
immune
for
a
fee
for
service.
that
is
how
the
vienna
conventions--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
not
at
all.
that's
not
my
position.
let
me
make
my
position
clear.
if
there
is
a
fee
for
service
provided,
such
as
garbage
collection,
or
provision
of
water,
that
would
fall
under
the
commercial
activities
exception.
but
if
there
is
a
tax,
unless
the
activity
at
issue
and
the
cause
of
action
at
issue
is
based
upon
the
commercial
activity,
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
this
does
not
mean--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes.
there
cannot
be
a
suit
for
taxes.
there
could
be
a
suit
for
specific
fees
for
services
rendered.
but--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--yes.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
just
as
if
the
indian
mission
went
out
to
a
private
water
company
and
said,
please
supply
me
with
water,
the
private
water
company
could
sue,
based
on
commercial
activity,
to
collect
for
the
water
it
had
provided.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
the
city.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
the
nature
of
the
activity
doesn't
change
just
because
it's
the
city
providing
the
water
as
opposed
to
a
private
entity
providing
the
water.
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
activity.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
we
are
here--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--no.
no,
justice
scalia.
absolutely
not.
joint
appendix
page
78
is
the
city's
amended
complaint.
and
even
in
their
foreclosure
claim,
even
in
their
foreclosure
claim,
what
they
ask
is
for
a
judgment
of
foreclosure
directing
that
the
defendant
pay
the
amount
of
taxes,
interest
and
other
charges
due.
they
are
not
asking
for
an
interest
in
the
property.
all
this
case
is
about
is
money.
it's
not
about
rights
in
the
property.
and
there
is
a
very
big
problem
with
allowing
a
claim
for
money
to
become
a
right
in
property
merely
by
having
a
local
law
passed
that
converts
the
claim
into
a
lien.
the
city
of
new
york
tomorrow
could
pass
a
law
that
said,
if
you
don't
pay
your
parking
tickets,
that
is
automatically
converted
into
a
lien
on
the
property.
and
then
while
we
can't
sue
you
for
the
parking
tickets,
we
have
created
a
right
in
your
property.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
well,
that's
not...
that's
not
what
the
city's
position
is.
the
city's
position
is
a
lien
is
an
interest
in
property
and
falls
within
the
statute.
and
congress
didn't
write
in
the
statute
arising
out
of,
related
to.
it
said,
rights
in
the
property
are
an
issue.
so
if
under
the
city's
theory,
if
they
passed
a
lien
law
tomorrow
converting
all
parking
tickets
into
liens
on
property,
then
their
position
is
they
could
sue
us
for
parking
tickets.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
article
29
of
the
european
convention
expressly
excludes
any
intent
to
create
an
exception
for
tax
claims.
that
was
the
international
practice
at
the
time.
what
we
have
here
is
a
bootstrap
and
i
refer
to
the
court
to
its
decision
in
ministry
of
defense
of
republic
of
iran
against
elahi,
where
this
court
said
that
when
you
have
an
action
to
impose
a
lien,
it
is
analyzed
as
an
attachment
under
section
1609-1610
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
and
what
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
says
is
you
cannot
use
an
attachment
to
get
jurisdiction
where
jurisdiction
otherwise
does
not
exist.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
under
new
york
law,
yes,
and
we
have
chief
judge
fulbright
for
a
unanimous--
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
--well,
we
say
that
there's
no
right
to
impose
the
lien
because
the
vienna
convention
and
new
york
law
prohibit
the
taxation
of
the
property
and
you
cannot
impose
the
lien
to
collect
something
that
you're
not
entitled
to.
and
this
is
a
dispute
that
has
historically
been
resolved
through
diplomacy,
not
in
the
courts,
because
the
fact
is
whatever
happens
in
this
case
to
india
and
mongolia
is
likely
to
happen
to
the
united
states
around
the
world
and
that's
a
foreign
policy
question
for
the
state
department
to
decide.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i'm
afraid
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
j.p.
howley
i
am
afraid
so.
thank
you
very
much.
