justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
has
this
to
do
with
the...
aside
from
the
explanation,
when
i
read
through
the
transcript,
as
i
have,
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
transcript
he
didn't
say
a
word
that
suggested
he's
against
giving
the
death
penalty.
he
kept
saying
yeah,
in
special
circumstances,
not
always.
then
they
get
into
this
thing
where
he's
been
thinking
of
a
person
who
will
in
fact
commit
a
crime
again.
and
then
it's
put
to
him
directly:
have
you
thought
about
that
he
won't
be
committing
a
crime
again
if
he's
in
jail
the
rest
of
his
life.
he
says:
you're
right;
i
hadn't
really
thought
it
through.
i
want
to
know,
thinking
it
through,
could
you
consider
the
death
penalty?
do
you
think
under
the
conditions
where
the
man
would
never
get
out
again
you
could
impose
it?
yes,
sir.
so
you
don't
think
that
if
parole
was
an
option,
etcetera,
repeating
it.
death
penalty?
i
could
consider
it.
then
could
you
impose
it?
i
could
if
i
was
convinced
that
was
the
appropriate
measure.
and
it's
absolutely
clear
he's
not
thinking
of
the
repetition.
it
is
clear
he
is
thinking
that
it's
some
kind
of
a
mean.
and
i
compare
that
with
witt,
where
the
person
just
says
no,
i
can't,
and
i
compared
it
with
this
other
case,
gray,
and
they
say
it's
illegal
to
push
him
off
a
jury,
a
woman
who
is
confused,
and
finally
she
says:
i
think
i
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
probably
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
it
that
he
could
have
done?
was
he
shaking,
making
faces?
was
he
shaking
his
head
to
indicate
he
believed
the
opposite?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
something
like
that
happened,
isn't
a
prosecutor
of
any
sense
going
to
say,
i
want
it
noted
for
the
record
that
the
witness
while
he
said
these
words
was
chortling
inwardly
or
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
law
on
this,
and
you've
read
the
cases
more
recent
probably...
i've
skimmed
through
some
but
not
read
them
all,
as
i'm
sure
you
have.
and
the
statement
of
the
law
that
i
want
to
know,
is
it
still
valid
law,
is
in
witherspoon
on
522,
justice
stewart
in
the
footnote.
and
what
he
says
in
that
footnote
is,
"the
most
that
can
be
demanded
of
a
venire
man
in
this
regard
is
that
he
be
willing
to
consider.
"
and
those
are
his
italics,
"to
consider
all
of
the
penalties
provided
by
state
law,
and
that
he
not
be
irrevocably
committed
before
the
trial
has
begun
to
vote
against
the
penalty
of
death,
regardless
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
might
emerge.
"
"if
the
voir
dire
testimony
in
a
given
case
indicates
that
venire
men
were
excluded
on
any
broader
basis
than
this,
the
defendant's
sentence
cannot
be
carried
out.
"
is
that
still
a
valid
statement
of
the
law
or
has
it
changed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
washington
law.
no,
this
is
justice
stewart
of
the
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
doesn't
say...
that's
one
of
the
things
it
says.
but
the
other
is,
"the
most
that
can
be
demanded
of
a
venire
man
is
that
he
be
willing
to
consider.
"
--that's
the
word
that's
italicized...
now,
is
there
any...
"and
if
you
exclude
him
on
a
broader
ground
than
that,
the
death
sentence
cannot
be
carried
out.
"
now,
is
there
anything
in
any
later
case
that
suggests
a
change
in
that
respect?
