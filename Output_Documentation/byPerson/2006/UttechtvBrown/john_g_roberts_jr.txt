chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
06-413,
uttecht
versus
brown.
mr.
samson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
how
did
he
learn
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing
i
couldn't
clearly
discern
from
your
brief
is
the
significance
you
attached
to
the
defendant's,
defense
failure
to
object.
how
does
that
enter
into
our
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
justice
stevens's
articulation
of
judge
kozinski's
opinion
was
exactly
right
but
i
thought
you
would
in
response
cite
us
to
page
208a
where
the
washington
supreme
court
said
that
those
jurors'
views,
including
mr.
deal,
would
have
prevented
or
substantially
impaired
their
ability
to
follow
the
court's
instructions
and
abide
by
their
oaths
as
jurors.
it
seems
the
court
of
appeals
judge
overlooked
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
something
particular
under
washington
procedure,
this
summary
and
conclusions
section
at
the
end
of
the
opinion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
your
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
elliott.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
the
beginning
of
the
questioning,
isn't
it?
it
is
not
the
end
of
it.
it
is
surely
not
the
law
that
just,
whenever
a
juror
says
sure,
i'll
follow
the
instructions,
that
he's
automatically...
has
to
be
seated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
after
several
times
saying
the
only
time
he
would
consider
it
is
if
the
person
is
going
to
reoffend.
i
mean,
if
he
just
gets
the
right
answer
once
out
of
six
times
and
it's
the
last
time,
is
the
judge
required
to
ignore
the
prior
colloquy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
look
at
page...
look
at
page
262.
he
says,
you
know,
could...
could
you...
when
do
you
think
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate?
if
the
person
would
reviolate
if
released.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the...
what
if
the
voir
dire...
what
if
the
juror
said
just
what
he
said
on
a
few
occasions,
that
i
would
consider
it
if
the
person
would
reviolate?
and
that
was
all.
that
would
be
a
basis
for
excusing
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
go
as
far
as
judge
kozinski?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
on
the
that,
just
the
language
you
just
focused
on,
on
page
75,
if
that
was
correct,
you
disagree
with
it,
but
if
if
the
court
concluded
that
the
juror
had
not
overcome
the
idea
that
he
must
kill
again
before
imposing
the
death
penalty,
that
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
excusing
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
how
many
paraded
by?
i
mean,
do
we
know?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
your
view,
do
we
look
at
this
any
differently
through
aedpa
than
if
we
were
looking
at
this
on
direct
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
makes
a
difference
in
the
standard
of
review
that
we
apply
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
does
that
mean
we
give
a
greater
degree
of
deference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
your
view
as
to
whether
the
standard
of
review
with
respect
to
deference
to
the
state
court
is
different
in
this
respect
than
it
would
be
on
direct
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
brother
made
the
point
that
there
was
a
more
elaborate
explanation
of
the
trial
judge's
determinations
when
there
had
been
an
objection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
substantially
impaired.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is
a
lot
different
than
irrevocably
committed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
agree
that
substantially
impaired
is
not
the
same
as
irrevocably
committed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there's
a
third
choice
which
under
aedpa
is
the
washington
state
court
decision
to
which
we
should
defer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
page
208,
though,
the
washington
supreme
court
also
stated
the
standard,
as
i
understand
it
from
witt,
that
mr.
deal's
views
would
have
prevented
or
substantially
impaired
his
ability
to
follow
the
court's
instructions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
elliott.
mr.
samson,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
no.
06-413,
uttecht

brown.
