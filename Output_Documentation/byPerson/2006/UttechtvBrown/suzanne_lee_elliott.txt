ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
in
our
view
two
findings
by
the
washington
courts
here.
the
first
by
the
trial
court
is
objectively,
an
objectively
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented,
and
thus
the
writ
should
be
granted
under
50...
28...
2254(d)(2)?
and
the
supreme
court's
decision...
and
i'll
get
to
a
moment
to
where
i
think
their
decision
is,
in
the
record,
which
conflicts
with
the
state's
view
of
where
that
is...
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
controlling
precedent
in
witt
versus
witherspoon.
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to,
in
terms
of
the
state
supreme
court's
finding,
to
page
173a
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
but
i
would,
of
course,
first
like
to
start
with
the
actual
record
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
washington
state
trial
court's
decision
to
excuse
juror
deal
for
cause
was
be
objectively
unreasonable
based
upon
the
record,
because
juror
deal
said
many
times
on
the
record,
when
presented
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
could
impose
the
death
penalty
under
the
sketchy
view
he
had
of
washington
state's
statutory
capital
punishment
scheme,
that
he
could
do
so.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
no,
your
honor.
but
it
went
beyond
that.
and
at
page
73
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
very
question
was
put
to
him
by
the
prosecutor.
"now
that
you
know
that
in
washington,
if
you
find
the
defendant
guilty,
you're
only
going
to
have
two
choices,
the
death
penalty
or
life
in
prison
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
could
you
still
consider
under
the
appropriate
evidence
imposing
the
death
penalty?
"
and
mr.
deal
said,
"i
could
consider
it.
"
"yes.
"
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
no,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
he
only
said
it
once
out
of
those
times.
judge
kozinski
identified
in
his
opinion
six
times,
and
those
are
found
on
the
record
of
proceedings
at
page
62,
at
page
72,
and
again
at
page
73.
and
he
was
repeatedly
asked,
and
one
time
he
was
asked
first
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
you
could
consider
it...
this
is
on
page
72
and
then
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
you
could
impose
it?
even
if
he
would
never
get
out.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
but
that
is
one
of,
under--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--washington
law
it's
an
appropriate
consideration.
and
that's
the...
and
then
that
was
the
example
he
gave,
but
he
didn't
say
but
i'm
never
going
to
do
it,
if
he...
if
my
only
choice
is
death
or
life
in
prison.
and
i
think
that
the
state's
reading
of
the
voir
dire
here
actually
expands
both
the
objection
made
by
the
prosecutor
and
the...
the
substance
of
the
colloquy
with
juror
deal.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
make
of
those
answers
as
being
entirely
appropriate
under
the
questions
given
and
also
demonstrating
that
he's
clearly
not
a
juror
who
is
substantially
impaired
or
whose
views
would
prevent
him
from
considering
the
instructions
that
would
be
given
to
him
at
the
end
of
this
case.
if
fact
include
him
as
a--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--under
your
hypothetical,
no.
if,
however,
he
said
i
will
never
impose
the
death
penalty
if
the
only
choice
is
life
without
and
the
death
penalty,
i
think
that
would
be
problematic
under
washington
law.
but
he
never
said
that.
that's
the
reading
the
state
gives
his
voir
dire
but
it's
not
there.
because
that
would
prevent
him
from
making
the
decision
that
washington
requires.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
nobody
is
going
to
say
that,
although
in
other
cases,
in
other
records
and
other
cases
cited
by
the
state
here,
in
fact,
trial
judges
have
made
records
of
those
kinds
of
situations,
which
are
not
present
here.
and
in
fact,
for
example,
i
believe
it
was
gray
versus
mississippi,
the
judge
got
the
feeling
that
jurors
were
giving
answers
that
would
get
them
off
the
panel.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
it
is
not
required
under
washington
law.
and,
in
fact--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--that
is
corrected.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
that's
correct.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well
the
question--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--that's
what
he
said.
i--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--on
two
points
i
don't
go
as
far
as
judge
kozinski.
one,
i
believe
that
actually
there
has
to
be
some
deference
to
implicit
findings;
let
me
clarify
that,
and
i
know
the
state
has
pointed
that
out.
i
think
judge
kozinski's
language
was
a
little
loose
there.
i
think
he
probably
agrees
with
me.
as
to
the...
the
failure
to
object,
first
of
all,
if
the
court
says,
first
of
all,
are
there
any
objections;
now
again
we
have
admitted
that
what
he
said
was
i
have
no
objection.
but
the...
under
washington
law,
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
and
the
defense
attorney
all
knew
that
this
issue
could
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
the
prosecutor...
and
i'm
not
saying
on
habeas
review,
but
in
the
trial
court,
a
challenge
for
cause,
the
burden
falls
on
the
prosecutor
to
articulate
a
basis.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well
i
think
he
made
a
mistake,
then.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
your
honor,
the
only
basis
we
have
for
the
trial
judge's
ruling
is
the
objection
made
by
the
prosecutor.
and
the...
assuming
he
incorporated
that
as
the
basis
for
his
ruling.
what
prosecutor
said
was
that...
he
had
two
rulings.
first,
he
said
i
think
he's
overcome
his
problem
with
the
explanation
about
reasonable
doubt.
and
so
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
and
he
said,
and
i
don't
think
he
has
said
anything
that
overcame
this
idea
that,
of
he
must
kill
again
before
he
imposed
the
death
penalty
or
be
in
a
position
to
kill
again.
that,
it's
our
position
is
incorrect,
under...
an
incorrect
summation
of
what
happened
in
the
voir
dire
and,
in
fact--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--i'm
quoting
from
page
675.
which
is
mr.
matthews--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--of
the
joint
appendix.
which
is
mr.
matthews'
objection.
and
the
court
makes
basically
an
unadorned
grant
of
objection
that
for
cause.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
court
says...
uh...
the
bailiff
will
excuse
you.
counsel,
any
challenge
to
this
particular
juror?
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
64.
and
then
what
mr.
mulligan
says
is
we
have
no
objection.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i'm
sorry.
so--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--under
washington
law,
i
think
there
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
excusing
juror
deal
if
he
said
i
now
know
what
the
statutory
scheme
is,
and
only
if
there's
some
possibility
for
release
of
mr.
brown
and
the
opportunity
for
him
to
kill
again,
would
i
impose
the
death
penalty.
we
know
that
would
prevent
him
from
imposing
washington's
statutory
scheme
because
once
finding
him
guilty,
the
juror
will
never
be
released
again.
so
the
possibility
of
release
would
not
be
there.
and
so
he
would
reject
the
notion
that
you
must
consider
mitigating
factors
if
there's
no
possibility
of
release.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
that's
not
what
he
said.
and
in
fact,
juror
deal
was
a
thinking
juror,
a
juror
who
could,
in
fact,
consider
all
of
the
options.
we
disagree,
of
course,
with
the
prosecutor's
summary
that
this
concern
about
recidivism
was
somehow
central
or
pivotal
to
juror
deal.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
yes.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
the
harm?
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
my
answer
is
because
it's
a--
constitutional
issue
and
this
juror
could
also
have
considered
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
would
have
been
proposed
by
the...
at
that
stage
that
were
clearly
on
the
table
for
argument
in
front
of
the
jury
at
the
penalty
phase.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
under
gray
versus
mississippi,
i
don't
have
to...
mr.
brown
does
not
have
to
prove
that
it's
harmless.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
can't
say
in
the
vast
universe
of
capital
cases
in
washington
whether
that's
extraordinary
or
not.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
17,
i
believe.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
didn't
count
on
a
daily
basis,
your
honor.
in
a
quality
case
in
washington,
17
days
is
probably
pretty
average,
maybe
a
little
short.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
think
seven.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
no.
he
objected
to
12,
and
seven
of
those
were
granted,
that's
my
understanding.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
so
yeah,
i
don't
disagree
that
this
court
should
look
at
the
entire
record
of
voir
dire,
and
i
don't
disagree
that
judge
martinez
is
a
conscientious
trial
judge.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
when
he
granted
the
challenge
for
cause
to
this
juror,
he
did
not
and
he
could
not
find
that
this
juror
was
substantially
impaired.
he
could
not...
he
was
not
prevented
from
following
washington
law.
the--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--well,
yes.
i
mean,
you
have
to
view
it
through
the
lens
of
the
statute.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
there
is...
prior
to
the
enactment
of
aedpa,
there
was...
this
court
said
you
give
deference
to
the
trial
court's
findings.
aedpa
has,
of
course,
codified
that
deference
by
saying
that
the
trial
judge
has
to
be
objectively
unreasonable
based
upon
the
facts
developed
at
the
trial
court
level.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
don't
think
this
court
has
said
what,
on
balance,
what
the
difference
between
the
kind
of
deference
that
was
required
under
witherspoon
is,
as
laid
against
the
kind
of
deference
now.
it's
clear
congress
wanted
to
provide
a
substantial
amount
of
deference
to
the
trial
court
and
limited
habeas
review
of
state
court
decisions.
but
as
judge
kozinski
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
this
case,
that
didn't
mean
that
they
were
going
to
completely
eliminate
federal
habeas
review.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
yes.
i
think
under
habeas
review,
it's
a
more
substantial
review,
because
we
have
to
show
not
only
that
the
findings
were
unreasonable
but
they
were
objectively
unreasonable,
which
i
think
is
a
different
standard
than
saying
you
give
deference
to
the
trial
court.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
one
of
those
peculiarities
of
washington
law
that
you
should
give
respect
to,
but
it
is
essentially
meaningless
in
the
context
of
this
case,
because
all
the
parties
knew
this
case
was
going
to
be
reviewed
and
reviewed.
i
mean,
there's
automatic
appellate
review.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
i
respect
his
concerns
about
bushwhacking
or
mouse
trapping,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that's
washington
law
and
the
judge
was
well
aware
of
it,
as
were
the
parties.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
yes.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
that
the
reason
that
the
judge
didn't
mention
the
demeanor,
or
the
prosecutor
who
made
the
objection
didn't
mention
demeanor.
certainly,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
demeanor
had
been
a
concern
based
upon
the
answers
given
by
the
juror
here,
and
because
the
prosecutor
had
the
laboring
oar
at
the
trial
court
to
provide
a
basis
for
the
challenge
for
cause,
he
would
mention
it.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
do
believe
that
he
had
a
more
lengthy
explanation
where
there
were
objections.
but
whether
or
not
that
would
have...
there
was
something
in
the
demeanor
of
this
particular
judge
here
that
he
simply
didn't
mention,
it
can't
be
found
here.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
presumably
then,
he
would
have
said
that
in
response
to
the
prosecutor's
objections,
which
was
not
that
we
don't
believe
that
juror
deal
could
be
credible.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
that's
correct,
and
here
he
didn't.
so
i
think
the
assumption
was,
he
was
granting
the
objection
on
the
basis
provided
by
mr.
matthews,
which
was
incorrect
both
under
washington
law
and
under
the
facts
developed
in
the
voir
dire.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
that
is
still
a
valid
statement
of
the
law.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
this
court,
which
has
been
shortened
into
a--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--substantially
impaired
test.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
it's
substantially
impaired
to
prevent
or
substantially
impaired,
the
ability.
and
this
juror
never--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--yes,
i
would
agree,
because
you
could
say
i
favor
the
death
penalty,
as
this
juror
did,
and
still
sit
on
the
jury.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
cases
affirm
that.
and
in
fact,
this
juror
was
precisely
the
kind
of
juror
that
i
think
was
appropriate
to
sit.
what
he
said
was,
i
can
consider.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
but
none
of
those
statements
indicated
he
would
be
prevented
from
voting
for
the
death
penalty,
or
that
he
was
substantially
impaired
from
doing
that.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
if
it
means
only
that
he
would
consider
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness,
it
wouldn't
prevent
him
under
washington
law.
because
under
washington
law,
first
of
all,
the
presumption
is
for
life.
and
second
of
all,
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
a
person
would
recidivate
is
both
an
aggravating
and
a
mitigating
factor.
so
the
fact
that
he's
concerned
about
reoffense
is
perfectly
appropriate.
where
i
think
he
could
be
prevented
is
if
he
said,
if
this...
unless
this
guy
is
going
to
be
released
in
the
future,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
said
here,
your
honor.
what
he
said
was,
recidivism
is
important.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
think
he's
a
hanging
juror?
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
i
think
that--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--well,
if
the
juror
said...
it
would
make
a
difference
under
morgan
if
the
juror
said
i'm
not
going
to
consider
any
mitigating
factor.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
oh.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
under
washington
law
because
it
could
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
yes,
if
that
wasn't
what
the
record
demonstrated.
did
i
understand
your
question?
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
that,
but
for
lack
of
his
objection.
because
there's
no
harmless
error
analysis,
i
don't
think
it
can
make
a
difference
to
this
court,
and
because
in
washington
we
have
this
peculiar
rule
which
says
you
don't
have
to
object.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
absolutely.
and
if
there
had
been
a
mention
of
demeanor
on
this
record,
i
think
this
court's
decision
would
be
easy.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
well,
what
judge
kozinski
says
about
that
is
if
on
the
record...
you
have
a
cold
record
here
which
demonstrates
in
our
view
that
the
juror
is
completely
qualified
to
serve,
and
nothing
about
him
would
prevent
him
from
serving.
and
you
have
no
mention
of
demeanor
by
the
trial
judge,
but
speculation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution,
then
all
substantive
evidence
review
of
juror
challenges
in
capital
cases
is
dead
and--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--you
should
defer
to
the
supreme
court's
observation
in
witt,
but
only
i
think
if
there's
some
indication
on
the
record
that
there
is
demeanor.
and--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--the
washington
state
supreme
court
decision?
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
the
washington
state
supreme
court
decision
suffers
a
different
problem,
i
think,
your
honor,
which
is
that
what
the
washington
state
supreme
court
said
on
page
173
was
that
on
voir
dire
he
indicated
he
would
impose
the
death
penalty
where
the
defendant,
quote,
"would
reviolate
if
released",
which
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
and
in
fact,
that
is...
the
considerations
about
whether
or
not
mr.
brown
would
reviolate
whether
in
prison
or
not
are
considerations
under
washington
law
in
a
death
penalty
case.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
but...
i
agree
that
there
is
a
summary
that
says
that.
but
the
substantive
basis
for
the
trial
court'
decision
i
think
is
back
at
page,
as
i
said,
173a,
where
he--
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
--well,
if
you're...
you
mean
in
terms
of
the...
in
the
trial
court?
or
in
the
state
supreme
court
decision?
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
yes,
and
so
if
you
then
turn
to
the
end
of
the
opinion,
if
that's
what
you're
asking,
at
208,
there's
kind
of
a
summary
of
their
basis
for
all
of
the
challenges
made
by
mr.
brown
to
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
case.
there
were
also
challenges
to
other
jurors
as
well.
and
there
are
separate
paragraphs
where
the
court...
those
jurors
that
are
mentioned
in
the
summary
paragraph,
where
the
court
then
explains
the
various
reasons
why
it's
upholding
the
trial
judge
as
to
those
jurors
as
well.
ms.
suzanne
lee
elliott
that
is
true.
it
appears
as
though
what
they
did
was
to,
because
this
is
not
what
the
trial
judge
said,
this
is
the
basis
for
the
objection
by
the
prosecutor,
that
they
assumed
the
trial
judge
adopted
the
prosecutor's
objection.
in
sum,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
a
conclusion
here
that
juror
deal
could
not
subordinate
his
personal
views
about
the
death
penalty
or
that
he
would
frustrate
the
state's
legitimate
purpose
in
carrying
out
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
a
constitutional
capital
death
penalty
scheme.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
opinion
of
judge
kozinski
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case.
thank
you.
