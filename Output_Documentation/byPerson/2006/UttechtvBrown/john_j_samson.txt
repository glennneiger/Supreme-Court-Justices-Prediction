mr.
john
j.
samson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
that
mr.
brown
is
entitled
to
habeas
corpus
relief
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons.
first,
under
section
2254(3)(16)
of
the
anti-terrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
the
trial
judge's
dismissal
of
mr.
deal
from
the
jury
is
a
finding
of
fact
of
substantial
impairment
that
is
presumed
correct
unless
it
is
rebutted
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
brown
has
not
presented
such
evidence
because
the
record
before
the
state
court
supports
the
decision
to
remove
mr.
deal,
especially
since
the
trial
judge
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
mr.
deal
and
the
defense
had
no
objection
to
his
removal.
second,
under
2254(d)(2)
the
state
court
decision
was
based
on
a
reasonable
determination
of
the
facts.
since
the
finding
of
fact
was
correct
it
is
necessarily
reasonable.
and
third,
under
2254(d)(2),
the
state
court
decision
was
not
contrary
to
supreme
court
precedent.
since
the
trial
court
applied
the
correct
standard
under
witt
and
found
as
fact
that
mr.
deal
was
substantially
impaired
and
this
case
is
immaterially
indistinguishable
from
witt,
the
state
court's
decision
was
a
reasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
mr.
deal
did
indicate
in
the
voir
dire
that
he
could
impose
the
death
penalty
and
consider
it,
but
his
other
statements
created
an
ambiguity
which
the
trial
judge
was
in
the
best
position
to
resolve.
mr.
john
j.
samson
not
exactly,
your
honor.
prior
to
the
individual
voir
dire,
they
were...
there
was
instructions
given
to
the
jurors.
prior
to
the
filling
out
of
the
questionnaire.
mr.
john
j.
samson
no,
your
honor,
it
was
more
a
general
instruction
regarding
how
the
system
operates.
mr.
john
j.
samson
in
the
individual
voir
dire
of
mr.
deal--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
he
learned
an
hour
before
his
questioning
that
that
was
the
law.
he
was
not
informed
of
that...
of
tht
law
when
he
filled
out
his
questionnaire.
but
approximately
an
hour
before
the
individual
questioning,
he
was
informed
of
that,
and
he
indicated
that
in
his
questioning
that
he
had
just
learned
an
hour
ago.
mr.
john
j.
samson
he
learned
that
from
the
instructions
given
by
the
trial
judge
as
well
as
through
the
statements
by
defense
counsel
and
by
the
prosecutor.
and
the
defense
counsel
reminded
mr.
deal
of
the
fact
that
there
was
life
without
parole.
she
asked
him
if
he
can
consider
both
options,
death
and
life
without
parole.
he
said
he
could.
and
then
defense
counsel
asked
why
do
you
think
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate?
and
he
stated
again,
as
he
stated
in
his
questionnaire,
it
would
be
a
case
where
the
person
was
incorrigible
and
would
reviolate
if
rereleased.
mr.
john
j.
samson
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
prosecutor
in
viewing
mr.
deal's
responses
through
the
course
of
the
voir
dire,
the
prosecutor
viewed
mr.
deal
as
saying
the
only
time,
or
i
would
have
great
difficulty
in
imposing
the
death
penalty,
unless
the
person
would
be
released
and
would
be
in
a
position
to...
to
reoffend
or
kill
again.
mr.
john
j.
samson
that
is,
that
is
correct.
both...
both
are
correct,
your
honors.
at
joint
appendix
62,
he
was
asked
for
an
example
of
why
he
believed
the
death
penalty
was
appropriate,
and
he
says,
"i
think
if
a
person
is
or
would
be
incorrigible
and
would
reviolate
if
released,
then
it
would
be
appropriate.
"
and,
in
fact,
the
only
two
examples
he
ever
gave
of
when
he
believed
it
would
be
appropriate
is
when
a
defendant
wants
to
die
or
a
defendant
would
be
released
on
parole
and
could
kill
again.
and
the
prosecutor
specifically
asked
mr.
deal,
can
you
think
of
an
example,
or
a
situation
of
when
you
would
be
able
to
impose
a
death
penalty
now
knowing
there
is
life
without
parole,
and
mr.
deal
at
joint
appendix
71
to
72
said
i
would
have
to
give
that
some
thought.
like
i
said
up
until
an
hour
ago
i
did
not
realize
that
life
without
parole
was--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
the
statements
given
by
the
jurors
in
witt
and
darden
were
not
exactly
what
mr.
deal
said.
but
i
think
the
general
rule
that
the
deference
given
to
the
trial
judge
would
be
the
same
rule.
and
we
are
only
asking
this
court
to
apply
the
rule.
mr.
john
j.
samson
they
were,
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
statement
as
in
witt
and
darden
where
the
jurors
said
that
they
had
an
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
and
would
have
difficulty
applying
it.
that
is
correct.
the
statements
were...
were
different.
and
certainly
if
the
judge
viewing
a
juror
of
this
type
determined
that
the
juror
was
not
impaired,
then
that
decision
would
also
be
entitled
to
deference.
in
fact,
an
example
occurred
in
this
case,
juror
obeso,
the
judge...
there
was
a
challenge
by
the
prosecutor.
there
was
actually
an
objection
by
the
defense.
and
the
judge
said
mr.
obeso
says
that
he
can
follow
the
law
and
impose
the
death
penalty
and
i
think
he
can.
mr.
john
j.
samson
your
honor,
there's
two
points
made
from
the
failure
to
object.
the
first
is
it
explains
why
there's
no
evidence,
expressed
evidence
regarding
demeanor
or
credibility
or
even
an
express
statement
regarding
demeanor
or
credibility
or
even
an
express
statement
as
to
substantial
impairment.
the
second
is
that
as
the
court
stated
in
witt,
it
is
a
significant
factor
the
court
may
consider
in
its
evidence
that
show
the
judge
acted
appropriately.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
had
two.
mr.
john
j.
samson
he
was
one
of
the...
the
early
jurors.
he
was
on
november
3,
which
was
about
five
to
six
days
into
the
individual
voir
dire
on
the
death
qualification.
mr.
john
j.
samson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--well
the
peremptories
were
not
exercised
until
the
death
qualification
and
the
other
for-cause
checks
are
were
done.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
so
they,
they
completed
all
the
death
qualification.
and
then
those
jurors
that
that
remained
they
had
further
individual
voir
dire,
and
the
defense
and
the
prosecutor
then
used
their
peremptories
interchangeably
to
remove
jurors.
mr.
john
j.
samson
i
would...
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
the...
the
state
supreme
court
on
page
171a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
specifically
was
citing
to
witt
and
the
rules
from
witt.
and
that
includes
the
rule
that
the
trial
judge's
exclusion
of
a
juror
constitutes
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
john
j.
samson
they
did,
your
honor.
they
did.
and
that
is
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
john
j.
samson
it
is
from
all
the
facts
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
before
it.
it's
one-paragraph
analysis
of
mr.
deal
did
not
lay
out
all
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court.
and
the
statement
208-a,
although
it's
listed
as
a
conclusion,
essentially
constitute
a
finding
of
fact.
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
is
not
a
finding
of
fact,
it
contains
with
it
the
implicit
finding
of
fact.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
samson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
state
courts
made
no
finding
of
fact
and,
as
mr.
brown
has
essentially
admitted
in
his
response
brief,
there
are
two
state
court
findings
of
fact,
one
by
the
washington
supreme
court
and
one
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
john
j.
samson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
more
just
the
style
of
the
justice
who
wrote
the
opinion
and
how
he
writes
his
opinions.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
the
aedpa--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
there
will
never
be
a
case
where
the
deference
given
to
a
trial
judge
and
the
deference
given
to
a
state
court
in
factual
determinations
can
be
overcome.
certainly,
it's
hard
to
think
of
one,
but
there
can
be
a
case
where
that
deference
could
be
overcome.
mr.
john
j.
samson
it
is
correct
the
state
supreme
court--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
but
the
appellate
court
finding
also
was
based
on
the
trial
court
finding
of
fact,
and
the
state
supreme
court
recognized,
as
this
court
did
in
witt,
that
deference
must
be
given
to
the
trial
judge,
who
did
have
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
juror.
mr.
john
j.
samson
no,
your
honor,
and
neither
did
the--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
on
demeanor
because
the
defense
counsel
did
not
object.
mr.
john
j.
samson
your
honor--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
as
this
court
explained
in
witt,
when
there
is
no
objection
or
no
dispute
as
to
the
factual
issue
in
the
trial
court,
the
judge
has
to
reason
to
elaborate
on
his
finding
and
therefore
he
has
no
obligation
to
do
so.
mr.
john
j.
samson
your
honor,
if
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
in
the
record--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--yes,
your
honor.
in
marshall
versus
lonberger
the
court
said
there
is
no
requirement
for
explicit
finding
as
to
credibility.
mr.
john
j.
samson
not
on
demeanor,
but
there
can
be
judicial
review
on
the
other
facts
that
are
presented
in
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
samson
it
is
the
burden
on
him
to
present
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
john
j.
samson
yes,
your
honor.
that's
as
to
a
different
juror
when
there
was
an
objection,
and
because
there
was
no
objection
there
was
no
obligation.
if
i
may--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--your
honor,
he
could
attempt
to
bring
evidence
in
a
state
court
collateral...
he
actually
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
as
to
another
juror.
he
did
not
do
that
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
samson
the
trial
judge
made
no
such
express
finding
because
there
was
no
objection
raised.
and
if
i
may
reserve--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
samson
he
would
have
made
a
finding
if
there
was
an
objection.
if
i
may
reserve--
mr.
john
j.
samson
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
samson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
the
questions
regarding
the
witherspoon
language
and
whether
it's
still
good
law,
the
court
in
witt
essentially
said
that
is
no
longer
the
standard.
the
standard
instead
is
the
substantial
impairment
standard,
and
it
is
not
required
to
show
that
the
juror
would
never
impose
the
death
penalty
or
automatically
vote
against
it
by
unmistakable
clarity.
and
the
fact
that
there
were...
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
fact
that
there
were
so
many
claims
presented
to
the
state
supreme
court
may
explain
in
part
the
summary
opinion
regarding
this
particular
issue.
aedpa
does
not
require
a
perfect
opinion
by
the
state
court
to
survive
review.
it
only
requires
reasonableness
and
an
objective
standard.
in
addition,
the
arguments
presented
by
mr.
brown
are
essentially:
we
disagree
and
the
federal
courts
should
disagree
with
the
factfinding
process
done
by
the
state
courts.
but
the
fact
that
a
reviewing
court
reviewing
the
same
transcript
may
reach
a
different
factual
determination
is
not
sufficient.
if
the
view
reached
by
the
state
court
is
supported
by
evidence
and
is...
thank
you,
your
honor.
