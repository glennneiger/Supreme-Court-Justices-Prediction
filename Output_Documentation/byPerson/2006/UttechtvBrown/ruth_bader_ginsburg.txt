but
one
piece
of
evidence
that...
one
piece
of
information
that
wasn't
given
apparently
to
those
jurors,
they
didn't
know
about
it,
was
that
life
meant
life
without
parole.
because
when
he
was
questioned,
he
was
surprised,
he
didn't
know
that
that
was
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
gave
that
as
an
example.
he
didn't
say
and
that's
the
only
circumstance
in
which
i
be
willing
to
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
asked
to
give
an
example.
he
didn't
say
for
example.
but
he
didn't
say
this
would
be
the
only
situation
in
which
i
would
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
a
finding?
it's
listed
under
"summary
and
conclusions".
under
"findings",
i
thought
under
"findings"
the...
the
findings
were
that
he
misunderstood
the
standard.
he
said
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt,
rather
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
what
other
finding
of
fact
was
there?
because
this
one
is
listed
under
conclusions.
"from
the
facts,
i
conclude
that
he
would
be
impaired.
"
but
the
impairment
is
the
conclusion
from
what
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
at
this
point,
this
juror,
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
aggravating
circumstances.
he
doesn't
know
about
mitigating
circumstances.
he
hasn't
been
told
what
the
standards
of...
that
it
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
to
say
that
he
should
be
criticized
because
when
he
was
asked
to
give
an
example
he
said
one
thing
and
not
another,
it
seems
if
you
just
read
the
transcript,
that
there's
nothing
disqualifying.
so
as
you
said,
everything
is
the
weight
falls
on
the
demeanor,
which
an
appellate
court
can't
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
kozinski
thought
the
reason
there
was
no
objection
was
that
this
juror
came
across
as
being
pro-death
penalty.
isn't
that
what
he
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you,
according
to
this
structural
error,
so
you
have
a
death
case,
and
so
you
have
this
kind
of
error
you
don't
have
to
prove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you're
zeroing
in
on
this
particular
juror
and
the
colloquy,
but
shouldn't
we
look
at
the
entire
proceeding
of
the
jurors,
including
that
there
were...
what
was
it...
seven
attempts
by
the
prosecutor
to
have
a
for
cause
excusal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
seem
that
this
trial
judge
was
doing
a
conscientious
job.
he
granted
five
of
the...
rejected
five
of
the
prosecutor's,
and
how
many
of
those
had
been
where
defense
counsel
had
objected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
objected
in
seven
and
in
five
of
those--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
i'm
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
the
number
of
the
page
that
you
gave
telling
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
capital
sentence,
and
there
are
umpteen
challenges
made.
so
the
judge
is
dealing
with
richard
deal
in
one
paragraph.
the
defendant
raised
a
host
of
challenges,
and
so
there's
not
perfect
consistency
with
what
these
two
passages
in
the
opinion.
but
mustn't
we
take
into
account
what
this
was?
it
was
the
defense
brought
out
every
objection
they
probably
could
conceive
of
and
they
didn't
put
particular
emphasis
on
this,
so
it
comes
out
this
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
supreme
court.
now
we're
talking
about
the
washington
supreme
court.
you
said
they
got
it
wrong
because
they
said
in
this
paragraph
that
he
got
the
law
you
wrong,
he
made
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law
because
he
said
he
would
impose
the
death
penalty
where
the
defendant
would
reviolate
if
released,
which
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
we
don't
know
exactly
what
that
court
meant
by
that
paragraph,
but
we
do
know
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
basing...
i
don't
know
how
many
objections
they
were
dealing
with
in
this
opinion,
but
a
great
many.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
point
is
simply
that
where
the
court
is
faced
with
so
many
challenges,
this
particular
one,
there
had
been
no
objection
at
the
trial.
so
an
appellate
court
might
think
we
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
that
one.
