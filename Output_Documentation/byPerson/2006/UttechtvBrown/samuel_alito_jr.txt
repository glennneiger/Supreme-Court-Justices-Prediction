justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
twice
just
before
his
final
statement
he's
given
exactly
the
question
whether
he
could...
whether
he
impose
the
death
penalty
in
any
situation
other
than
when
the
person
might
get
out
and
kill
again,
and
he...
his
answers
are
at
best
equivocal.
the
first
time
he
says
i
would
have
to
give
that
some
thought.
that's
on--
72.
and
then
he
says
i
do
feel
that
way
if
parole
is
an
option.
without
parole
as
an
option
i
believe
in
the
death
penalty.
which
is
totally
ambiguous.
what
do
you
make
of
those
answers?
