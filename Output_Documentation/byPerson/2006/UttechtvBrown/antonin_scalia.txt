justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
say,
"for
example",
with
regard
to
the
quotation
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned?
i
didn't
recall
that
he
said
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
aren't
we
obliged
under
aedpa
to
give
deference
to
any
reasonable
conclusion
from
the
facts?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
it
is
just
a
conclusion,
aedpa
still
applies
to
it
unless
it's
a
totally
unreasonable
conclusion,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
there
is
on
demeanor.
i
mean,
i
suppose,
to
begin
with,
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
burden
is
on
the
habeas
applicant
to
show
that
demeanor
did
not
make
the
difference?
it's
the
burden
on
him
to
show
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
secondly,
he
could
present
such
evidence
if
he
showed
that
there
was
absolutely
no
ambiguity
in
what
the
person's
statements
said,
so
that
demeanor
could
not
have
made
a
difference.
but
in
a
case
where
the
statements
are
seemingly
contradictory
or
arguably
contradictory,
demeanor
is
very
relevant
and
it's
the
burden,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
petitioner
to
show
that
demeanor
wasn't
what
made
the
difference.
and
besides
which,
wasn't
there
some
part
of
the
record
that
you
referred
to
where
he
said
"and
i
believe
him"?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you...
you
insist
that
he
come
out
and
say
in
so
many
words,
i
am
going
to
be
an
unreliable
juror.
that's...
that's
not
the
way
it
happens.
and
somebody
has
to
evaluate
whether
indeed
he's
shading
the
truth
a
little
bit
and
whether,
in
fact,
he
will
be
impaired
in
his
service.
and
some
of
these...
some
of
these
answers
suggest
that.
and
it,
it
is
not
an
easy
call
to
simply
say
well,
you
know,
unless
he
comes
out
and
admits
yes,
i'm
going
to
be
a
lousy
juror,
nobody
is
going
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
was
there
no
objection
if
this
was
so
clear?
if
this
fellow
had
answered
all
the
questions
the
way
you
expect
a,
a
good
juror
to
answer,
why
was
there
no
objection
when
the
state
moved
to
dismiss
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
but,
but
competent
counsel
knows
that
getting
something
overturned
on
appeal
is
a
lot
harder
than
getting
it
done
right
the
first
time.
and
he
also
knows
that
if
you
raise
an
objection,
you're
more
likely
get
it
done
right.
i
can't
imagine
why
if
he
thought
this
person
was
not
properly
strikeable
he
would
have
sat...
indeed
not
just
sat
silent
but
said
i
have
no
objection.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
made
the
same
mistake
the
judge
did.
i
wonder
who
else
was
there
that
made
the
same
mistake.
i
mean,
you
know,
it
makes
you
think
maybe,
maybe
the
judge
was
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
75
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
many
days
did
this
take?
justice
antonin
scalia
17
days?
less
than
one
a
day.
that's
pretty
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
he
said
for
one
of
the
other
witnesses,
i
just
don't...
i
don't
believe
him.
and
if
that
had
been
his
problem
here,
he
presumably
would
have
said
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
there's
no
opposing
objection
by
defense
counsel.
when
there
was,
and
when
part
of
his
reason
for
granting
the
motion
to
strike
the
juror
was
demeanor,
he
mentioned
demeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
what
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
said
that,
but
elsewhere
he
sort
of
indicated
that
he
couldn't
consider
it
unless
it
were
a
situation
in
which
this
person
would
be
able
to
commit
the
crime
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
indicate
that
unless
that
was
the
situation,
he
wouldn't
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty.
i
think
that's
precisely
what
they
indicated.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
recidivate
by
the
way.
i'm
going
to
use
it
in
the
opinion.
it's
a
very
useful
verb.
