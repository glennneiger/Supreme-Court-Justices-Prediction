mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
this
is
a
record
in
which
the
trial
judge
showed
that
he
was
meticulously
careful
in
applying
the
standard
from
wainwright
versus
witt.
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
at
pages
7
through
9,
there's
an
extensive
discussion
of
how
the
judge
is
going
to
apply
the
witt
standard
evenhandedly.
he's
going
to
eliminate
those
jurors
who
are
like-biased.
he's
going
to
eliminate
those
jurors
who--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
it's
very
clear
that
he
told
the
parties,
if
you
have
any
question,
if
you
have
any
problem
with
any
of
the
objections
that
are
made,
speak
up
and
i
will
intervene
and
question
the
juror
myself
and
clarify
it.
and
this
is
a
judge
who,
against
the
background
of
the
entire
voir
dire,
clearly
was
making
a
good
faith
effort
to
apply
the
witt
standard.
there
were
12
objections
by
the
prosecution
to
various
jurors
that
they
should
be
excused
for
cause
because
of
inability
to
apply
the
law
as
washington
gives
it.
the
defense
objected,
i
believe,
to
seven
of
those;
and
the
prosecution
lost
on
five
of
those
occasions.
so
the
judge
basically
went
with
the
defense
when
the
defense
spoke
up
and
objected.
there
were
two
jurors
that
were
excused
over
the
defense
objection.
the
transcript
is
also
in
the
voir
dire
on
those
and
it
shows
that
the
defense
objected
and
said
these
jurors
can
apply
the
standard
under
the
law,
and
the
judge
found
that
they
could
not
and
excused
them.
in
the
case
of
juror
deal
there
is
no
absolutely
reason
to
believe
that
the
judge
wouldn't
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing
if
the
defense
had
objected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
said
"we
have
no
objection".
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
three
significant
legal
errors
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
in
disposing
of
this
challenge.
this
court
made
clear
in
wainwright
versus
witt
that
the
absence
of
a
defense
objection
is
very
critical
in
assessing
whether
a
judge's
implied
finding
of
bias
is
to
be
upheld
on
appeal.
and
it's
for
the
reason
that
my
colleague
mentioned
in
part:
if
the
judge
is
not
asked
to
give
a
fuller
explanation,
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
think
your
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
reason
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case,
justice
breyer,
is
that
you
and
i
and
every
other
appellate
lawyer
and
judge
who
have
looked
at
this
is
dealing
with
a
cold
record,
but
the
only
person
who
actually
saw
and
heard
this
juror
give
the
responses
was
the
trial
judge.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
there
were
five
separate
occasions
during
juror
deal's
voir
dire
in
which
he
expressed
either
uncertainty
or
a
misconception
about
what
the
death
penalty
should
be
exposed
for
when
measured
against
washington
law.
and
the
overarching
point
that
i
make
before
i
talk
about
those
five
instances
is
that
this
is
a
record
in
which
there
is
confusion
and
uncertainty
about
whether
juror
deal
really
can
adhere
to
the
law.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
only
judge
who
can
truly
resolve
that
and
determine
whether
he
should
be
credited
is
the
trial
judge.
and
this
court
has
made
that
point
over
and
over
again
in
describing
its
voir
dire.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
confusion
alone
is
not.
if
it's
confusion
it
must
rise
to
a
level
of
preventing
or
impairing
the
juror's
ability
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
at
all,
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
and
i
think
the
concern
underlying
your
own.
there
has
to
be
fair
support
in
the
record
for
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
judge
could
have
resolved
the
question
of
a
juror's
competence
to
sit
in
the
way
that
he
did.
and
if
you
had
a
record
in
which
everything
that
juror
said
was
consistent
with
complying
with
state
law,
which
i
don't
think
this
record
is,
and
the
prosecutor
objected,
and
the
judge
says
granted,
and
there's
no
explanation,
i
think
that
would
be
difficult
to
uphold,
even
if
it
is
possible
that
everyone
in
the
courtroom
knew
that
the
judge
was
relying
on
demeanor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
is...
no.
there's
nothing
explicit.
but
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
there
does
not
have
to
be
because
in
this
case,
in
particular,
since
there
was
no
objection,
the
judge
did
not
elaborate
on
his
reasons
at
all.
but
the
court
has
gone
further
in
witt
and
in
darden
and
building
on
cases
like
patton
versus
yount,
and
made
clear
that
it
is
implicit
in
a
judge's
action
in
response
to
an
objection
that
he
has
relied
on
the
totality
of
the
law
and
his
observations.
and
here
there
were
two
instances
during
the
defense
colloquy
in
which
the
juror
specifically
said
that
his
example
of
when
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate
is
a
circumstance
when
somebody
is
incorrigible
and
will
reoffend
if
released.
and
then
three
times
during
the
prosecution's
voir
dire,
he
volunteered,
first
of
all,
that
it
would
have
to
be
in
my
mind
very
obvious
that
the
person
would
reoffend.
and
this
was
a
particularly
significant
answer
because
it
wasn't
given
in
response
to
a
death
penalty
question,
it
was
given
in
response
to
whether
he
could
apply
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
to
the
crime.
he
again
comes
back
to
the
reoffend
notion
after
having
state
law
explained
to
him
again,
and
said,
could
you
consider
imposing
the
death
penalty,
he
said
i
have
to
give
that
some
thought.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
i
think
the
important
point,
justice
souter,
is
that
under
washington
law
there
were
really
two
alternatives,
life
without
parole
or
death.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
concern
that
i
think
the
prosecutor
had
and
that
the
judge
accepted
is
that
this
juror's
vision
of
when
capital
punishment
is
appropriate
is
when
somebody
will
get
out
and
kill
again.
and
under
that
analysis,
you
would
never
impose
capital
punishment
under
washington
law,
because
the
defendant
is
never
going
to
get--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not...
not
automatically,
justice
stevens.
i
mean,
this
is
an
juror--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
what
has
to
be
the
case,
and
this
court
in
witt
made
clear
it
is
not
going
to
apply
an
unmistakable
certainty
requirement,
is
that
the
judge
has
to
conclude
that
juror's
views
would
prevent
or
substantially
impair
juror
in
applying
the
law.
and
the
judge
had
to
make
a
call
based
on
what
he
saw
and
what
none
of
us
did,
of
whether
this
juror's
views--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yeah.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
they
there
are.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well
the
judge
found
one.
by
excusing
him
after
having--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well
he
made
clear,
if
i
may
conclude,
he
made
clear
at
the
outset
as
i
think
i
did
when
i
started
my
presentation,
that
this
record
shows
a
judge
who
was
conscientiously
applying
the
witt
standard.
