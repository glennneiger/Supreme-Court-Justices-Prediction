justice
david
h.
souter
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
one
thing,
which
i
have
assumed,
and
i
think
it
is
correct,
but
i'd
like
to
be
sure
of
it.
is
it
the
case,
is
it
correct,
that
prior
to
the
voir
dire
questions,
no
one
had
given
a
statement
to
the
venire
people
of
what
the
law
was
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
they
told
what
the...
i
forget
how
many
factors
are
enumerated
under
the
washington
law?
were
they
told
what
they
were?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
the
state
courts
had
made
or
had
expressed
no
conclusion
other
than
the
final
conclusion
that
he
is
impaired,
that
that
conclusion
itself
would
be
entitled
to
aedpa
deference
if
the
record
could
be
read
to
support
it;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
case,
then
aedpa
deference
is
more
than
deference,
isn't
it?
aedpa
deference
has
reached
on
your
view
the
conclusion
that
if
there
is
any
factual
support
in
a
record,
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
court
will
be
upheld,
whereas
i
thought
aedpa
deference
went
to
factfinding
and
to
express
conclusions
that
the
court
drew.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
trial
judge
made
no
conclusion
about
demeanor.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
demeanor,
did
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we're
going
to
get...
that
takes...
it
seems
to
me
it
takes
deference
yet
one
further
step.
we're
saying
that
even
if
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
about
demeanor,
we
are
supposed
to
assume
that
a
trial
judge
drew
a
conclusion
based
on
demeanor.
i
mean,
that
is
not
deference.
i
mean,
that's
simply
imputing
fiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
the
defense
counsel's
obligation
to
object?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
is
objecting,
saying
i
want
this
juror
removed,
and
the
trial
judge
is
saying,
okay,
i
will
remove
him,
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
make
a
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
there
be?
i
guess
my
point
is
if
there
isn't,
then
in
effect
you
are
making
the
defendant
responsible
for
creating
a
record
to
support
what
the
other
side
asks
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
means
that
the,
that
the
argument
for
sustaining
the
trial
judge's
action
on
the
ground
that
the
trial
judge
could
observe
demeanor
in
effect
is
the
elimination
of
judicial
review
on
that
subject,
because
we
know
that
if
the
venire
person
was
present
in
the
courtroom
and
the
judge
was
present
in
the
courtroom,
the
judge
probably
looked
at
him,
and
if
that
is
enough
to
sustain
judicial
action
on
the
grounds
that
we
defer
to
demeanor
then
there's
no
judicial
review
at
all.
i
think
that's
what
judge
kozinski
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
talking
about
demeanor.
and
there's
nothing
as
i
understand
it
on
the
record
about
demeanor.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
be
anything
on
the
record
about
demeanor,
then
there
is
no
judicial
review
on
that
point
at
all,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
there
any
way
that
he
can
show
that
demeanor
didn't
make
a
difference
when
the
record
is
absolutely
silent
on
demeanor?
is
there
any
way
he
can
show
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
judge
did
rely
on
demeanor?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
had
not
been
given,
as
i
understand
it,
the
explanation
of
what
the...
i
keep
saying
nine
factors.
whatever
the
enumerated
state
factors
were.
he
had
not
been
told
that
at
any
point,
had
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the...
the
questioning
was
what
grounds
are
you
going
to
look
to
make
that
decision;
and
he
had
not
been
instructed
on
washington
law
on
that
at
all.
