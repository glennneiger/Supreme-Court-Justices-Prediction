justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
if
we
grant
your
position
and
grant
you
relief,
that
it
would
be
something
of
an
extension
over
witt
and
darden,
in
that
the
jurors
in
witt
and
darden
had
fixed
views,
that
they
were
as
a
matter
of
conscience
opposed
to
the
penalty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
but
i
do
think
that
the
views
of
this
juror,
deal,
were
somewhat
more
equivocal
than
in
the
cases
i've
mentioned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
on
that
point
that
the
state
is
somewhat
surprised
and
whipsawed.
and
i
understand
that
the
washington
court
reached
the
issue.
it
is
not
independent
state
ground.
i
take
it
the
prosecutor
had
some
peremptories
left?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
late
in
the
process
was...
was
deal
considered?
was
he
one
of
the
early
jurors
or
one
of
the
late
jurors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
was
about
a
17
day
voir
dire?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
cuts
a
little
bit
against
the
peremptory.
i
mean,
if
it
was
early
in
the
game
the
prosecutor
might
not
have
exercised
the
peremptory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
see.
so
the
whole
jury
is...
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
stands
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
incorrect
in,
in,
in
not
noting
what's
there
too
late.
it's
just
not
a
fair
summary
of
what
the
washington
supreme
court
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is...
i
know,
justice
breyer;
just
on
this
point.
the
defense
actually
volunteered
"no
objection".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
confusion,
is
that
grounds
for
excluding
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
may
well
be
objected,
there
were
12
instances--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
which
the
prosecutor
wanted
to
excuse;
in
seven
of
those,
there
was
an
objection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
he
certainly
knew
how
to
object.
and
you
absolutely
trap
the
trial
judge
here
by
not
indicating
to
him
that
he
should
make
some
further
finding.
in
fact,
the...
the...
the
lawyer
doesn't
just
remain
silent.
he's
standing
and
says
i
have
no
objection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally
the
court
did
not
say
are
there
any
objections?
the
court
did
not
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
court
didn't
say
is
there
an
objection?
so
you're
incorrect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
he
could
have
imposed
the
death
penalty
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
harm
then
in
replacing
him,
from
your
standpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
complaining
about
the
excusal
of
a
juror
who
by
your
own
submission
would
impose
the
death
penalty.
so
why
am
i
here?
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
were
actually
12,
i
think.
weren't
there
12
objections
by
the
prosecution?
i
was
going
to
ask,
we've
already
destroyed
the
rebuttal
time
of
your
colleagues,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
large
number
of
challenges
by
the
prosecutor.
can
you
comment
on
that?
12?
i
mean,
the
defense
objected
to
seven,
and
five
objections
were
sustained.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
think
the
prosecution
challenged
12
times.
there
were
seven
objections.
five
were
sustained.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way:
there's
no
demeanor
finding
here.
suppose
the
judge
had
made
a
demeanor
finding.
that
would
be
different,
the
case
would
be
a
different
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
the
objection
is
what
prevents
the
demeanor
finding,
then
maybe
we
should
be
able
to
consider
the
fact
there
was
no
objection,
even
though
washington
law
doesn't
require
it
before
we
consider
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
fact
that
this
is
structural
error,
that
there's
no
harmless
error
analysis,
mean
that
we
should
be
very
careful
to
give
substance
to
the
rule
that
there's
deference
to
the
trial
judge?
and
in
fact,
in
the
witt
case,
we
said
that
the
determination
to
excuse
a
juror
is
based
on
determinations
of
demeanor
and
credibility
that
are
within
the
trial
judge's
province.
we
said
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
presumes
that
there
is
that
judgment
made
by
the
district
judge,
whether
or
not
it's
mentioned?
it
was
not
mentioned
in
witt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
defer
to
judge
kozinski's
observation
or
to
the
supreme
court
in
witt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
respondent
cal
coburn
brown
was
convicted
in
washington
state
court
of
committing
aggravated
first-degree
murder
after
kidnapping,
robbing,
raping,
and
torturing
the
victim
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
the
question
now
is
whether
brown
was
sentenced
in
violation
of
his
right
to
a
jury
has
not
been
tilted
in
favor
of
capital
punishment.
the
voir
dire
for
brown’s
trial
had
a
separate
phase
for
determining
this
issue
that
is
to
say
whether
the
jurors
were
death
qualified.
this
was
to
determine
whether
each
perspective
juror
could
be
impartial
and
deciding
between
the
sentences
of
death
on
one
hand
or
life
in
prison
without
possibility
of
parole
on
the
other.
in
this
death
qualification
voir
dire
phase
lasted
11
days.
during
that
phase
brown,
the
accused,
challenged
18
jurors
as
been
too
disposed
toward
the
death
penalty.
the
state
objected
to
excusing
some
of
these
potential
jurors
that
had
argued
they
should
be
permitted
to
serve
because
they
said
they
would
consider
both
sentences
and
follow
the
law.
defense
counsel
however,
argued
that
even
when
a
juror
promises
to
follow
the
law
that
is
insufficient
to
show
that
he
or
she
is
impartial.
11
potential
jurors
were
excused
on
brown’s
motion,
on
the
defense
motion.
the
state
for
its
part
challenged
12
jurors
as
too
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
brown
objected
seven
times
and
two
jurors
were
excused
over
brown’s
objections.
and
the
voir
dire
was
going
slowly
the
trial
court
informed
counsel
that
if
a
juror
seems
so
confused
as
to
be
unacceptable
to
both
counsel
the
process
would
go
better
if
both
sides
came
forward
and
told
the
judge
the
juror
could
be
excused.
now,
the
excusal
of
just
one
juror
is
in
question
here
and
the
opinion
referred
to
that
juror
is,
juror
z.
before
being
examined
juror
z
was
twice
informed
that
if
brown
were
convicted
of
aggravated
murder,
the
alternative
sentences
would
be
life
in
prison
without
parole
or
death.
when
he
filled
out
a
questioner
about
his
belief
in
the
death
penalty
he
indicated
the
penalty
was
only
acceptable
when
the
defendant
could
be
released
and
would
offend
again.
during
questioning
by
counsel
z
several
times
reiterated
the
importance
of
release
and
reviolation.
this
was
despite
having
been
told
by
both
counsel
and
the
judge
that
brown
would
not
be
released
if
he
were
convicted.
at
the
same
time,
z
promised
to
follow
the
law
and
said
he
will
consider
the
death
penalty
and
we
have
attached
the
full
transcript
of
the
voir
dire
examination
of
juror
z
to
the
opinion
of
the
court.
at
the
end
of
the
questioning
the
prosecution
move
to
excuse
that
z
is
unable
to
impose
the
death
penalty
because
there
was
no
possibility
brown
would
be
released.
defense
counsel
immediately
volunteered
no
objection.
juror
z
was
excused;
brown
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
that
noted
brown’s
lack
of
an
objection
to
z’s
removal.
it
then
held
that
under
the
controlling
constitutional
cases
excusing
z
was
not
a
violation
of
brown’s
right
to
fair
trial.
brown
sought
federal
habeas
relief
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
it
held
that
the
lack
of
an
objection
was
irrelevant
that
no
deference
to
the
trial
court’s
decision
was
necessary
because
the
transcript
of
z’s
questioning
unambiguously
showed
he
would
be
an
acceptable
juror
and
that
brown
was
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
trial.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
our
precedents
establish
that
because
of
the
state’s
interest
in
administering
at
system
of
capital
punishment.
the
juror
maybe
excused
for
cause
of
the
juror’s
use
will
prevent
or
substantially
impaired
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
a
juror
in
accordance
with
his
obstructions
and
his
oath.
the
trial
court
can
perceive
the
demeanor
of
the
potential
juror
for
that
reason
the
trial
court
is
entitled
to
deference
in
determining
whether
there
is
substantial
impairment.
as
this
court
is
held
in
two
previous
cases
the
trial
court’s
judgment
must
stand
when
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
transcript.
deference
is
due
even
when
the
trial
court
does
not
give
its
reason
for
excusing
the
juror.
we
have
also
held
that
failure
to
object
by
a
defendant
is
relevant
to
the
enquiry.
even
if
as
here
it
was
not
treated
as
an
absolute
bar
to
relief
under
state
law.
even
on
a
face
of
the
transcript
juror
z’s
comments
that
suggest
us
that
he
would
have
been
substantially
impaired
in
a
case
like
this
where
a
life
in
prisons
or
without
parole
was
possible.
moreover,
z’s
demeanor
during
voir
dire
may
have
supported
this
impression.
the
trial
judge
was
careful
and
conscientious
in
conducting
this
voir
dire.
brown’s
counsel
was
thorough
and
aggressive
in
objecting
the
state’s
challenges.
nevertheless,
neither
the
trial
court
nor
the
defense
saw
any
problem
with
the
state’s
motion
to
excuse
juror
z.
in
our
view
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
statement
by
defense
counsel
no
objection
must
be
taken
that
mean
the
defense
had
no
objection
to
the
excusal
of
juror
z
and
washington
supreme
court’s
decision
can
be
read
to
reach
the
same
conclusion.
particularly
in
light
of
the
deference
owed
to
the
state
court
determination
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act.
the
record
does
not
support
brown’s
effort
more
than
a
decade
after
the
voir
dire
to
second-guess
the
trial’s
court’s
judgment.
the
trial
court’s
decision
was
reasonable.
brown
was
not
denied
a
fair
trial
and
for
these
reasons
now
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
breyer
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
millions
of
americans
oppose
the
death
penalty.
most
of
them
are
nevertheless
able
to
follow
the
trial
judge’s
instructions
in
capital
cases
and
therefore
are
qualified
to
serve
as
jurors.
as
then
justice
rehnquist
explained
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
1986,
“it
is
important
to
remember
that
not
all
who
oppose
the
death
penalty
are
subject
to
removal
for
cause
in
capital
cases;
those
who
firmly
believe
that
the
death
penalty
is
unjust
may
nevertheless
serve
as
jurors
in
capital
cases
so
long
as
they
state
clearly
that
they
are
willing
to
temporarily
set
aside
their
own
beliefs
in
deference
to
the
rule
of
law.”
today
the
court
pushes
aside
decades
of
well-established
law
emphasizing
that
only
a
juror
whose
views
would
“substantially”
impair
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
a
juror
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
and
his
oath
may
be
struck
for
cause.
the
court
created
that
rule
to
prevent
against
unnecessarily
narrowing
the
cross-section
of
potential
jurors
and
selecting
the
jury
predisposed
toward
imposing
the
death
sentence.
in
broadly
redefining
this
standard
today
the
court
has
rendered
yet
meaningless
and
jeopardized
the
very
rationale
that
lead
to
its
creation.
the
juror’s
struck
for
cause
in
the
case
before
us
today
was
not
even
an
opponent
of
the
death
penalty.
he
repeatedly
and
unambiguously
asserted
his
capability
to
follow
the
law
stating
that
he
believed
in
the
death
penalty
in
severe
situations
that
there
are
times
when
the
death
penalty
would
be
appropriate
and
that
he
could
consider
and
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty
even
when
he
knew
the
only
other
available
sentence
would
be
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
yet
the
court
reads
those
statements
as
ambiguous
and
without
any
support
from
the
record
suggested
there
was
something
about
the
juror’s
demeanor
that
must
have
caused
the
trial
judge
to
correctly
conclude
that
he
could
not
perform
his
duties
as
instructed.
this
juror
is
only
arguable
favoring
was
his
desire
to
take
his
responsibilities
as
a
juror
with
special
seriousness
and
to
acknowledge
that
in
some
situations
the
severe
sanction
of
a
death
serenity
may
not
be
appropriate.
in
the
past
we
have
protected
against
such
jurors
being
struck
for
cause
in
order
to
prevent
the
jury
from
being
unfairly
biased
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
today
the
court
has
done
away
with
that
protection
rendering
countless
americans
ineligible
to
serve
as
capital
jurors
and
more
importantly,
preventing
countless
defendants
from
being
tried
to
a
fair
an
impartial
jury.
because
the
court’s
decision
is
in
my
view
wholly
unsupported
by
the
record
or
our
prior
precedence
i
respectfully
dissent.
