justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
chief's
question
about
the
failure
to
object?
i
think
i
got
the
impression
from
judge
kozinski's
opinion
that
he
thought
that
the
washington
supreme
court
found
that
with
respect
to
two
out
of
the
three
jurors
at
issue
that
there
had
been
a
finding
that
they
were
substantially
impaired,
but
with
respect
to
this
juror,
that
the
washington
supreme
court
seemed
to
rely
on
the
failure
to
object
as
the
principal
explanation
for
their
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
this
perhaps
just
such
a
case?
because
this
finding
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
is
based
only
on
the
written
record,
so
it
does
not
get
any
benefit
of
observing
the
demeanor
of
the
witness...
i
mean,
the
demeanor
of
the
prospective
juror;
isn't
that
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
we
disagreed
and
thought
there
was
not
evidence
in
the
written
record
that
would
support
that
conclusion,
we
should
not
give
deference
to
that
appellate
court
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
record,
because
i
did
miss
something
before.
did
the
trial
judge
say
in
so
many
words
that
deal's
views
would
have
prevented
or
substantially
impaired
his
ability
to
follow
the
court's
instructions
and
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
jurors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
the
point
of
the
absence
of
objection.
that's
why
he
didn't
make
the
critical
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
judge
didn't
make
the
critical
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
please
finish
up
the
thought
because
you're
equally
well
prepared.
how
do
we
know
the
trial
judge
would
have
made
that
a
finding
if
there
had
been
an
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
respond
to
the
possible
suggestion
that
judge
kozinski
made
that
what
he
really
did
was
act
on
the
basis
of
no
objection,
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
he
failed
to
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it
follow
that
his
limited
cases,
the
views
about
when
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate
would
translate
into
views
of
whether
he
could
or
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty
if
instructed
properly
by
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
have
to
be
automatic
in
order
to
justify
the
result
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
world
of
difference,
at
least
it
has
been
my
experience
in
trials
like
this
of
what
a
juror
will
do
on
his
own
and
what
he
thinks
the
law
might
be,
and
what
is
fair,
and
so
forth,
as
opposed
to
what
a,
the
juror
will
do
in
response
to
proper
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jurors
mostly
are
pretty
conscientious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
this
guy
wasn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
without...
because
there
was
no
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
one
of
the
most
troubling
parts
about
this
case
is
the
failure
to
object.
as
i
understand,
under
washington
law,
that
doesn't
making
any
difference,
the
review
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
an
objection.
but
under
our
review
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
should
it
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
response
to
justice
kennedy's
concern
that
this
really
allows
for
a
mouse
trapping
of
the
trial
judge
who
very
likely
would
have
paid
less
attention
to
the
issue
as
long
as
any
counsel
doesn't
object,
just
as
a
realistic
way
that
this
kind
of
thing
is
handled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
can
get
back
to
my
concern
about
the
failure
to
object
again.
supposing
this
defense
counsel
instead
of
just
saying
no
objection,
said
no
objection,
i
think
he's
a
hanging
juror?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
he
thought
contrary
to
the
prosecutor,
his
appraisal
of
this
man
was
that
he's
going
to
be
pro-death
penalty,
and
he
let
that
be
known.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
would
under
washington
law.
i
don't
suppose
it
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
the
juror
just
did
what
he
did,
but
everybody
was
evaluating
his
demeanor
in
the
courtroom,
and
defense
counsel's
evaluation
was
to
mean
i
don't
want
that
juror,
he's
going
to
hang
my
client,
and
that's
what
he
thought
and
he
let
it
come
out
when
he
told
the
judge
no
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did.
do
you
think
it
should
make
a
difference
to
us
if
we
think
that
he
didn't
really
want
this
guy
on
the
jury?
