justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
quick
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
public
disclosure
of
the
claim
that
ultimately
prevailed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
public
disclosure
was
made
in
the
newspapers
rather
than
in
an
official
government
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
a
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
statute,
you
his
the
first
prong.
it
has
to
be
an
action
based
on
public
disclosure
of
information,
which
you
agree
it
was;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
that
it's
within
4(a),
that
it
was
an
action
based
on
a
public
disclosure
of
information
disclosed
in
newspapers;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
asking
you,
really
what
i'm
seeking
to
find
out
is
what
is
the
scope
of
the
public
disclosure
that
everyone
agrees
was
made?
was
it
all
newspapers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
publicly
disclosed
in
the
newspapers,
does
that
fit
into
one
of
the
categories
of
public
disclosure
mentioned
in
4(a)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
everybody
agrees
on
what
those
news
reports
contained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
the
original
source
of
the
information
was
published?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
supposing
he
is
the
only
source
of
the
information
that's
publicly
disclosed
on
which
precipitated
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
and
after
the
complaint
is
filed
discovery
reveals
other
violations
of
law
on
which
the
government
prevails,
but
they
do
not
prevail
on
the
theory
of
the
original
complaint.
would
he
be...
come
within
the
statute
or
without?
the
statute
focuses
on
the
information
that
gave
rise
to
the
suit,
not
on
what's
found
by
way
of
discovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
we
only
look
at
the
public
information
at
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed.
