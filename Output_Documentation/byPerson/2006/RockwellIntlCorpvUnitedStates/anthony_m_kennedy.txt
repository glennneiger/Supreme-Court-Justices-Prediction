well,
suppose
a
company
has
a
plan
to
defraud
the
government
and
it
use
a
certain
chemical
mix
to
save
money
and
that's
what
the
real
fraud
is.
and
it
puts
it
in
place
and
it
puts
it
in
place
in
1988.
and
the...
and
it
has
just
two
containers
full
of
this.
and
the
relator
knows
about
it.
the
relator
then
quits.
then
for
10
years
the
company
does
the
same
thing,
following
the
same
patterns,
same
method,
same
improper
formula.
and
he
then
rings...
he
then
brings
this
to
the
attention
of
the
government
in
the
proper
way
and
files
a
suit.
he
cannot
recover
for
the
later
action
which
was
the
same
pattern,
practice?
