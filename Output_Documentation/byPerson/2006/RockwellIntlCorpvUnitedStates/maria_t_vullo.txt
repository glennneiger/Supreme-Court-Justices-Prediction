ms.
maria
t.
vullo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
as
the
government
recognizes,
mr.
stone
is
an
original
source.
and
it
is
important
to
the
look
at
the
statute
and
its
purpose.
the
original
source
provision
is
intended
to
determine
who
may
bring
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government.
and
the
recovery
provision,
3730(d)(1),
determines
how
much
if
anything
a
relator
may
share
in
the
government's
recovery.
in
this
case,
whether
where
the
government
fully
supports
the
relator,
i
would
submit
that
the
interests
of
the
statute
and
the
interests
of
the
united
states
are
fully
satisfied.
and
that
is
because
mr.
stone
is
the
paradigm
not
parasitic
relator.
he
had
knowledge
firsthand
from
his
six
years
at
rockwell
of
a
pattern,
justice
kennedy,
a
pattern
of
criminal
conduct
and
a
pattern
of
rockwell
concealing
that
information.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
justice
scalia,
i
would
beg
to
differ
on
that.
mr.
stone
in
his
affidavit
at
179
in
the
joint
appendix
and
also
in
his
disclosure
statement,
which
is
at
29...
i'm
sorry,
174
and
175
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
disclosure
statement
at
290,
what
he
described
was
a
defective
design
of
the
system
for
taking
the
sludge
out
of
the
pond.
and
what
he
specifically
said...
and
this
is
very
important...
what
he
specifically
said
was
when
you
took
the
sludge
out
of
the
ponds
in
that
manner,
it
was
going
to
have
too
much
liquid,
and
it
was
going
to
lead
to
deterioration
of
the
environment.
he
said
that
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
case.
and
at
trial,
what
the
testimony
was...
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
mr.
freibach's
testimony
at
joint
appendix
522,
as
well
as
at
the
trial
transcript
at
987,
the
issue
there
was
the
variability
of
the
sludge
which
may
have
caused
greater
inspections
and
may
have
required
additional
cement.
and
what
is
very
important
is
even
mr.
freibach
who
is
the
first
foreman,
on
whom
petitioners
rely,
he
testified
that
during
his
tenure,
the
variation
of
the
sludge
required
between
200
and
350
pounds
of
cement.
that's
at
the
trial
transcript
at
987
and
the
joint
appendix
at
522.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
that's--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--justice
scalia,
two
important
points.
first
is
that
neither
the
criminal
conviction
nor
the
jury's
verdict
determined
the
cause
of
insolidity.
the
issue
in
the
criminal
case
and
the
issue
in
the
false
claims
act
case
as
to
pondcrete
was
that
the
pondcrete
was
insolid
and
they
were
lying
to
the...
the
government
about
that.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
your
honor,
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence...
and
i
would...
out
of
55
witnesses
and
500
documents,
was
that
there
were
certain
people
who
were
using
too
little
cement.
there
was
also
evidence--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--that's
not
correct,
justice
souter.
the
reason
for
the
variation
and
the
need
for
additional
cement
was
because
the
sludge
had
variations
and
there
was
too
much
liquid
in
it,
which
was
precisely
what
mr.
stone
said.
and
every
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
to
huge
variation
of
the
liquid
content
in
the
sludge
which
required
more
cement,
and
even
the
amount
of
cement
that
was
required
was
very
variable.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
no.
that's
not
correct,
justice
souter.
in
fact,
there
was
no
particular
ratio
that
had
to
be
followed
of
cement
to
sludge.
there
was
testimony
that
different
individuals
who
worked
on
the
pondcrete
used
different
amounts
of
cement.
and
as
i
said--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--mr.
stone
did
not
testify
at
trial.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
the
jury...
mr.
freibach
described
the
process.
we
did
not
get
into
the
engineering
detail,
your
honor,
of
it.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you,
justice
scalia,
that
that
wasn't
required.
what
we
needed
to
prove--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
voluntarily
provides
prong
requires
the
relator
to
be
honest
and
truthful
and
submit
all
the
information
he
has.
and
mr.
stone
did
that
and
the
government
has
never
said
otherwise.
in
fact,
he
met
with
the
fbi
agent--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
mr.
stone
did
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
his
allegations.
and
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
discussion
with
petitioner's
counsel
as
to
the
jurisdictional
petition
in
this
statute.
there
is
no
question
that--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
that,
the
tenth
circuit
did
rely
on
that
document
and
did
not
consider
any
other
information
as
a
result
of
its
ruling
with
respect
to
that
document.
the
tenth
circuit
also
had
before
it
the
awards
fee
documents
which
mr.
stone
provided
to
the
government,
and
those
are
at
joint
appendix
247
to
249.
it
also
had
mr.
stone's
affidavit
when
he
testified
in
his
affidavit
as
to
his
meetings
with
the
government,
and
also
had
additional
affidavits--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
his
affidavit
describes
his
meetings
with
the
fbi
and
epa
beginning
in
1986,
and
that's
at
joint
appendix
180
through
181.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
justice
stevens,
we
in
the
courts
below
agreed
for
purposes
of
the
original
source
provision
that
there
was
a
public
disclosure.
i
think
what's
important
following
up
on
the
question--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--in
newspapers
and
also
the
criminal
investigation,
but
i
think
what's
important
is
that
the
standard
that
rockwell
seeks
to
have
this
court
adopt
would
actually
require
such
a
great
level
of
specificity
that
is
not
in
the
public
disclosure
at
all.
and
i
think,
justice
stevens,
you
asked
that
precise
question.
the
public
disclosure
was
very
general.
and
the
tenth
circuit--
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
--it
was
newspapers,
and
the
fbi
agents'
search
warrant
affidavit
was
also
publicly
disclosed
prior
to
mr.
stone's
filing
of
the
action.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
yes.
it
says
news
reports
in
that
provision
of
the
statute.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
rockwell
agrees,
but
i
could
tell
your
honor
what
i
believe
those
news
reports
said,
and
they
said
that
there
were
environmental
violations.
there
were
some
news
reports
in
june
of
1988
about
a
spill
on
the
pondcrete
pads.
not
a
single
one
of
the
news
reports
about
the
spill
on
the
pondcrete
pads
described
at
all
any
false
claim
or
false
statement,
and
neither
did
the
agents'
search
warrant
affidavit.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
appropriate
test.
it's
not
before
this
court,
but
i
believe
that
the
direct
and
independent
knowledge
requirement
is
information
on
which
the
allegations
are
based,
and
the
allegations
refer
to
mr.
stone's
allegations
at
the
commencement
of
the
action.
after
all,
it's
a
jurisdictional
provision,
and
it
should
be
determined
at
the
outset
of
the
action.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
that
issue.
the
issue
was
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
i
understand
even
rockwell's
position,
that
is
not
rockwell's
position,
that
rockwell's
position
is
like
our
position,
that
it's
information
in
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
but
i
would
submit
that
that
would
make
no
difference
in
this
case
because
mr.
stone's
knowledge
is
direct
and
independent
of
the
information
in
his
complaint
as
well
as
the
information
in
the
public
disclosure.
and
what
is
important
is
that
rockwell
is
asking
this
court
to
adopt
the
quick
trigger
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
because
that
was
the
tenth
circuit's
law
on
public
disclosure.
yet
in
this
case,
say
that
mr.
stone's
direct
and
independent
knowledge
has
to
be
very,
very
specific.
it
has
to
be
of
the
particular
false
statements,
and
that
would
eviscerate
the
entire
original
source
rule.
and
if
i
could
just
get
to
the
point
of
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
why
rockwell's
position
as
to
the
trial
evidence
is
wrong,
it's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
allegations.
it
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
evidence.
in
fact,
in
the
provision
e.
2,
which
is
a
provision
regarding
bringing
claims
against
members
of
the
judiciary
and
members
of
congress,
congress
said
information
or
evidence,
but
in
this
provision
e.
4,
congress
only
said
information.
so
looking
at
the
trial
evidence
would
be
wrong
by
virtue
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
it
also
would
be
wrong
as,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
pointed
out.
since
1824,
i
believe
this
court
has
held
that
jurisdiction
is
determined
at
the
time
of
commencement
as
of
the
state
of
things
at
that
time.
and
as,
justice
ginsburg,
you
pointed
out,
it
would
be
an
inappropriate
rule
to
say
that
if
the
government
decides
to
refine
the
allegation,
after
all,
it
is
still
a
concrete
allegation.
ms.
maria
t.
vullo
justice
scalia,
i
think
this
is
a
jurisdictional
provision
that
congress
created.
we're
not
talking
about
the
federal
question
jurisdictional
statute.
but
in
this
provision,
just
like
in
the
clean
water
act
in
the
walton
case,
the
statute
uses
the
word
allegations.
as
in
that
case,
the
statute
used
the
word
alleged.
and
the
court
held
very
clearly
that
you
look
at
it
as
of
commencement.
now
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
we
had
a
federal
question
case
and
the
relator
or
the
plaintiff
withdrew
the
federal
claim.
then
there
would
be
a
loss
of
jurisdiction.
here
of
course,
the
amended
complaint
satisfied
jurisdiction
when
the
government
adopted
the
relator's
claim.
thank
you.
