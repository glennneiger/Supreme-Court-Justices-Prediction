mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
freibach,
who
was
the
earlier
foreman,
testified
that
under
his
watch,
he
needed
between
250
and
300
pounds
of
cement,
and
that
there
was
a
constant
inconsistency
in
the
sludge
content
coming
out
of
the
ponds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
features
of
this
case
that
may
appear
anomalous
is
the
fact
that
the
government
is
aligned
with
stone.
that
is,
it's
rockwell's
position
that
the
entire
recovery
in
this
case
should
go
to
the
united
states.
it
is
stone's
position
that
the
recovery
should
be
shared
with
the
relator,
and
the
government
agrees
with
stone.
it
might
be
natural
for
the
court
to
wonder,
why
would
it
be
in
the
government's
interest
to
advocate
that
a
share
of
the
money
damages
in
this
case
should
be
given
to
a
private
party.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
government
believes
that
there
are
three
systemic
government
interests
that
are
implicated
by
this
case
and
that
would
be
endangered
if
rockwell's
position
prevailed.
first,
in
our
view,
stone
is
precisely
the
type
of
relator
that
congress
intended
to
encourage.
stone
was
somebody
who
had
substantial
firsthand
knowledge
of
rockwell's
environmental
practices
and
of
its
billing
practices,
and
moreover,
stone
was
somebody
who
didn't
conceal
his
information
from
the
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
agree.
and
as
to
stone's
original
complaint,
the
statute
frames
the
inquiry
as
whether
stone
has
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
the
allegations
were
based.
and
we
agree
with
rockwell
and
with
stone
that
that
refers
to
the
allegations
in
his
complaint.
now
the
allegations
were
fairly
generalized.
they
didn't
refer
specifically
to
pondcrete,
and
they
covered
a
wide
range
of
time,
from
1980
through
to
the
present,
which
was
1989
as
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
stone
subsequently
submitted
a
lengthy
affidavit
in
which
he
explained
what
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
rockwell
was
engaged
in
a
systematic
practice
of
violating
the
environmental
laws
and
misrepresenting
the
nature
of
its
compliance
to
the
government.
that
information--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
there
certainly
could
be
a
situation
in
which
the
government
intervenes
in
a
suit
but
files
what
can
be
regarded
as
a
substantially
different
claim.
for
instance,
if
the
government
had
intervened
in
this
suit
and
had
claimed
that
rockwell's
requests
for
payment
were
fraudulent
because
rockwell
had
misrepresented
its
compliance
with
the
anti-discrimination
laws,
that
would
be
an
example
of
a
fundamentally
different
fraudulent
scheme
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
didn't
introduce
the
engineering
report.
and
i
do
want
to
focus
on--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he
had
provided
substantial
information
about
a
pattern
of
concealment
of
environmental
violations
generally.
that
at
least
to
some
extent
was
responsible
for
an
fbi
investigation
which
uncovered
further--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
proved
essentially
the
state
of
affairs
that
he
predicted
would
occur.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
nevertheless,
the
relator
had
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
his
allegations
were
based.
and
i'd
like
to
focus
on
this
question
of
the
cause
of
the
insolidity
of
the
pondcrete
because
i
think
to
regard
that
as
the
theory
of
the
government's
liability
really
reflects
a
misunderstanding
of
the
false
claims
act.
for
purposes
of
the
false
claims
act
counts
in
this
case,
it
was
sufficient
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
pondcrete
in
fact
failed,
leaked
hazardous
substances
into
the
environment,
that
rockwell
was
aware
that
the
pondcrete
was
failing,
and
that
rockwell
nevertheless
continued
to
represent
that
it
was
in
compliance
with
the
environmental
laws.
for
purposes
of
proving
those
allegations,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
offer
any
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
pondcrete
failed.
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
pondcrete
failed
and
that
rockwell
knew
about
it.
in
fact,
i
wouldn't
encourage
the
court
to
read
the
whole
trial
transcript,
but
i
think
if
the
court
reads
the
plaintiff's
statement
of
claims,
which
is
about
30
pages
of
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
ja-463,
that
summarizes
the
events
that
rockwell...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
that
stone
and
the
united
states
intended
to
prove
at
trial,
and
by
far
the
predominant
focus
is
on
the
fact
of
pondcrete
failures
and
rockwell's
awareness
that
they
had...
that
pondcrete
had
failed.
there
were
a
couple
of
paragraphs
in
those
30
pages
that
alluded
to
the
supposition
that
the
cause
of
the
failure
was
inadequate
cement
content.
there
were
also
isolated
references
to
that
theory
at
trial.
but
to
characterize
that
as
the
theory
of
liability
i
think
would
be
a
misconception.
the
government
didn't
have
to
persuade
the
jury
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
why
the
pondcrete
failed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
again--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--again,
the
statute
doesn't
require
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
fraud.
it
requires
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
the
allegations
were
based.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
his
basis
for
making
that
prediction
was
that
he
believed
that
the
process
would
malfunction.
he
was
also
aware--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
independent
of
whether
there
had
every
been
a
public
disclosure,
it
would
have
been
open
to
rockwell
to
argue
in
response
to
the
original
complaint
that
stone
couldn't
consistent
with
rule
11
make
allegations
as
to
what
had
happened
at
the
plant
after
he
left
because
he
no
longer
had
an
evidentiary
basis
for
doing
so.
rockwell
could
have
made
that
argument,
again
regardless
of
whether
a
public
disclosure
had
occurred,
and
the
question
whether
it
is
a
permissible
inference
for
a
plaintiff
to
say,
i
saw
them
committing
systematic
environmental
violations
while
i
was
there
and
i
inferred
that
the
same
thing
would
go
on
after
i
left...
the
question
that's
a
permissible
inference
for
a
plaintiff
in
a
federal
civil
action
to
make
is
a
question
to
be
decided
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
public
disclosure
provision
serves
a
different
purpose
entirely.
it's
designed
for
those
cases
in
which
the
relator
has
sufficient
information
to
file
a
complaint
that
complies
with
the
federal
rules
of
similar
procedure,
but
that
information
overlaps
substantially
with
information
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
knowledge,
but
i
think
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
the
original
complaint
was
not
focused
on
pondcrete
specifically.
the
original
complaint
alleged
more
generally
that
rockwell
was
engaged
in
widespread
environmental
safety
and
health
violations
and
was
consistently
misrepresenting
to
the
government
that
it
was
in
compliance
and...
even
though
it
knew
that
it
was
not
doing
so.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
i
would...
i
would
disagree
with
the
premise
that
his
reasons
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
why
the
government
is
getting
money.
again
to
return
to
the
hypothetical
i
suggested
earlier,
if
the
government
then
filed--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
has
to
be
connected
with
his
allegations.
and
certainly,
if
you
look
at
the
theory
of
liability
that
prevailed
at
trial,
namely
that
pondcrete
blocks
were
leaking
hazardous
substances
into
the
environment
and
rockwell
was
nevertheless
asking
for
government
funds
based
on
misrepresentations
that
it
was
in
compliance,
if
you
look
at
that
theory
of
liability
and
then
examine
stone's
original
complaint,
clearly
that
theory
is
logically
encompassed
within
the
more
generalized--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
and
i
think
i
would
put
that
with
the
hypothetical
that
i
offered
about
the
government
adding
a
claim
that
rockwell
had
misrepresented
its
compliance
with
the
antidiscrimination
laws.
and
i
think
there
won't
be
a
clear
dividing
line,
but
i
think
this
is
a
line
that
courts
have
to
draw
for
other
purposes
as
well.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we
would...
i
think
there
could
still
be
a
sufficient
connection
even
if
his
reason
for
thinking
the
pondcrete
failed,
they
all
turned
out
to
be
correct.
and
again,
we
would
emphasize
that
that's
particularly
so
here
because
the
reason
for
the
pondcrete
failure
was
not
an
element
of
the
claim.
i
mean,
imagine
if
this
case
had
been
tried
to
the
jury
and
there
had
been
an
established
rule
in
place
that
if
the
pondcrete
was
shown
to
have
failed
because
of
a
defect
in
the
machinery,
stone
would
get
a
share,
but
if
it
was
shown
to
have
failed
because
the
human
operator
added
too
little
cement
stone
wouldn't
get
a
share.
if
that
had
been
the
rule
there
would
have
been
a
clear
potential
for
disharmony
between
the
government
and
the
relator.
it
would
have
raised
exactly
the
specter
that
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to,
where
the
government
prefers
to
emphasize
one
view
of
the
facts
rather
than
another
and
the
defendant
is
getting
in
the
way
by
suggesting
that
the
relator
will
be
deprived
of
a
share.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
need
to
know
more
about
the
hypothetical,
but
my
initial
reaction
is
that
that's
a
complaint
that's
easily
dismissed
based
on
rule
11,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
any
public
disclosure.
and
i
can
imagine
extreme
hypotheticals--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
if
the
complaint
just
gets
over
the
line,
that
is
if
the
evidence
in
the
relator's
possession
is
just
barely
good
enough
to
sustain
the
allegation
of
fraud
or
at
least
to
allow
the
suit
to
go
forward,
there's
no
reason
to
read
the
public
disclosure--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would
still
want
to
compare
the
nature
of
the
fraud
that
the
government
alleged
with
the
nature
of
the
fraud
that
the
relator
alleged.
and
obviously
this
is
a
question
in
which
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
balance
competing
interests.
it's
possible
to
come
up
with
hypotheticals
in
which
it
seems
as
though
the
relator
has
no
equitable
entitlement
to
a
share.
the
two
things
we
want
to
emphasize
are,
first,
in
terms
of
the
way
that
the
lawsuit
progresses
even
when
the
government
doesn't
intervene,
relators
once
they
file
suit,
if
they
are
allowed
to
proceed
on
their
own,
they
presumably
can
take
advantage
of
all
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
those
include
the
discovery
provisions
of
the
federal
rules.
and
it
would
obviously
be
self-defeating
to
tell
the
relator:
you
can
invoke
discovery
and
you
can
learn
relevant
information
from
the
defendant,
but
if
you
didn't
know
it
already
you
can't
use
it
at
trial,
because
if
you
use
something
that
you
didn't
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
before
the
complaint
was
filed
and
it
turns
out
to
be
persuasive
to
the
jury
you
can
be
kicked
for
not
being
an
original
source.
i
don't
think
congress
can
be
said
to
have
had
that
intention.
second,
in
cases
where
the
government
and
the
relator
intervenes...
where
the
government
intervenes
in
the
a
relator's
suit
and
the
two
prosecute
the
suit
together,
we
would
want
the
court
to
avoid
a
rule
that
would
create
artificial
disincentives
to
cooperation
between
the
two
plaintiffs.
and
the
idea
that
relatively
minor
variations
in
factual
assertions
that
are
ultimately
not
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
false
claims
act
liability,
if
those
carried
the
day
then
relators
in
future
circumstances
would
have
a
strong
disincentive
to
accede
to
the
government's
request
that
one
view
of
the
evidence
be
emphasized
rather
than
another.
if
the
court
has
nothing,
no
further
questions--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
a
minor
variation
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
relevant
to
the
defendant's
ultimate
liability.
that
is,
if
we
had
proved
that
the
pondcrete
leaked
hazardous
substances
into
the
environment
and
that
rockwell
knew
that
it
was
having
that
effect
and
that
it
nevertheless
represented
to
the
government
it
was
in
compliance,
that
would
be
enough
to
establish
the
knowing
submission
of
a
false
claim
even
if
we
had
no
idea
what
was
the
reason
for
the
pondcrete
failure.
and
even
if
rockwell
had
taken
the
most
herculean
measures
to
produce
good
pondcrete
and
had
not
departed
from
standards
of
care
in
any
respect,
if
nevertheless
they
knew
that
the
pondcrete
was
in
fact
failing
despite
their
best
efforts
and
they
represented
that
it
was
succeeding,
they
would
be
liable
under
the
false
claims
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
my
instinct
would
be
that
probably
he
could
still
recover.
i
think
the
question
then
would
boil
down
to
whether
the
discovery
responses
are
themselves
public
disclosures
such
that
they
would
trigger
a
new
original
source.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
probably
that
question
would
raise
no
public
disclosure
issue
to
begin
with,
because
if
there
had
been
no...
at
least
if
there
had
been
no
public
disclosure
of
the
fraudulent
conduct
that
was
revealed
through
discovery,
there
would
be
no
need
for
him
to
satisfy
the
original
source
test
with
respect
to
those
new
allegations.
