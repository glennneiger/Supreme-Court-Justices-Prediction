chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
05-1272,
rockwell
international
corporation
versus
united
states.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
wouldn't
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
pondcrete
at
all.
the
statute
just
says
the
information
on
which
his
allegations
are
based.
they
don't
say
the
allegations
that
eventually
give
rise
to
a
recovery.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
one
way
to
look
at
it.
another
way
would
be
you
would
allow
a
relator
in
a
situation
who
alleges
a
particular
fraud
that
causes
the
government
to
examine
the
books
and
uncovers
a
different
fraud
to
recover
on
that
basis.
it's
an
unusual
situation
to
have
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
determined
only
after
the
case
is
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
only
show
that
it's
wrong
at
the
end,
you
still
say
that
they
should
be
thrown
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
his
allegation
was
that
this,
the
design
is
not
going
to
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
an
allegation
that's...
i
mean,
it
is
either
true
or
it's
not
true.
the
fact
that
you
find
out
after
he's
left,
after
he's
been
terminated,
that
it
doesn't
work,
i
don't
see
how
that
should
affect
the
validity
of
his
allegations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
were
certifying
their
compliance
with
the
applicable
laws--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--based
upon
their
pondcrete
design.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
whole
purpose,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
ferret
out
fraud
on
the
government.
i
mean,
if
he
makes
an
allegation
that
this
design
is
not
going
to
work,
the
pondcrete
is
not
going
to
work,
and
the
government,
prompted
by
his
lawsuit,
investigates
it
and
finds
out
that
because
of
human
error
they're
not
making
it
the
right
way,
even
if
the
design
does
work,
he
get
no
credit
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
hypothetical?
are
you
suggesting
that
in
a
situation
like
that...
we'll
talk
about
whether
the
facts
comport
with
it
later...
but
in
a
situation
like
that,
he's
not
entitled
to
share
in
the
recovery
that
the
government
eventually
receives?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would,
you
would
change
that
to
say
direct
knowledge
of
the
information
not
on
which
the
allegations
are
based,
but
on
which
recovery
is
eventually...
eventually
ordered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
identified
them
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they've
identified
them
all
already?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
ms.
vullo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
is
worse
than
that,
though.
this
information
was
not
even
provided
to
the
government,
which
the
statute
requires.
he
not
only
has
to
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge,
he
has
to
voluntarily
provide
that
to
the
government.
and
i
understand
that
the
tenth
circuit,
to
have
relied
solely
on
the
document
at
joint
appendix
page
605,
that's
the
only
thing
he
provided
to
the
government.
and
all
it
says
is
that
this
design
will
not
work.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
don't
work,
but
that
doesn't
mean
there's
fraud
on
the
government.
you
don't
know
if
they're
going
to
fix
it,
they're
going
to
change
it,
use
a
different
design,
not
make
a
claim
based
on
that
design.
why
is
that
enough
to
satisfy
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
has
to...
if
the
information
that
he
provides
isn't
direct
and
independent
information
of
the
allegations,
it
would
seem
that
the
statute
is
not
satisfied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
get
off
my
question
here
but
did
you...
do
you
agree
that
this
page
ja
605
was
the
only
information
that
he
provided
to
the
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
i'd
better
phrase
it
differently.
do
you
agree
that
that
is
the
only
information
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
relied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
this...
he
has
to
provide
this
information
before
filing
an
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
the
allegations
referred
to
the
public
disclosure.
it
talks
about
public
disclosure
of
allegations,
and
then
says
he
has
to
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
allegations.
so
i
would
assume
that's
the
important
linkage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
vullo.
mr.
stewart?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
connected?
is
it...
i
got...
i'm
getting
the
sense
that
you
think
it's
enough
that
he
says,
look,
rockwell
is
just
lying
to
the
government
in
this
area,
and
you
say
well...
what
if
what
if
you
added
a
count
in
your
complaint
when
you
intervene
on
tax
fraud?
you
found
out
also
that
they
didn't
pay
taxes.
would
he
be
able
to
recover
for
that,
because,
you
know,
if
they're
going
to
lie
about
pondcrete
they're
going
to
lie
about
taxes.
is
that
sufficiently
connected?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
doesn't
matter
to
you
if
he
just,
if
he's
completely
wrong?
let's
say
he
says...
you
have
special
interrogatories
to
the
jury
and
his
allegation
has
always
been
the
pondcrete's
going
to
fail
because
you're
putting
in
the
wrong
kind
of
cement.
and
it
turns
out
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
at
all.
the
jury
says,
no,
that's
not
the
reason
it
failed,
it
failed
for
another
reason.
is
that
a
sufficient
connection?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

you
ms.
mahoney.

case

justice

g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia

opinion
in

rockwell
international
versus
united
states.
