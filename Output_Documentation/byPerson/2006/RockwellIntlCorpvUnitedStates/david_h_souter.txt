no,
but
was
the
reason
they
were
using
too
little
cement,
the
reason
that
there
was
a
variation
in
the
amount
of
liquid
being
taken
out
with
the
sludge
as
you've
described
to
us
that
he
had
claimed,
or
was
the
reason
simply
that
there
was
a
kind
of
standard
ratio
of
cement
to
sludge
and
that
standard
ratio
was
not
followed
in
the
later
cases?
in
other
words,
is
it
because
there
was
such
a
tremendous
variation
in
the
liquid
in
the
sludge
or
simply
because
there
was
a
standard
formula
having
no
particular
relationship
to
the
liquid
in
the
sludge,
and
they
simply
didn't
follow
the
standard
formula?
i
thought
the
government's
theory
was
the
latter,
and
if
it
was
the
latter,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
claim
that
he
was
making
that
there
was
too
much
variation
in
the
amount
of
liquid
in
the
sludge.

but
if
they
had
followed
the
formula
that
they
followed
at
the
beginning,
isn't
it
true
that
there's
no
evidence
that
even
these
variations
in
the
liquid
in
the
sludge
would
have
resulted
in
instable
or
insolid
pondcrete?
justice
david

this
was
truly
even
before
the
troubles
started,
even
before
the
insolid
pondcrete?
