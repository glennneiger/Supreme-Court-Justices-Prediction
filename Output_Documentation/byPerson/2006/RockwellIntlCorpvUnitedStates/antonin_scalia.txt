justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
am
i
wrong
about
this?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
was
not
an
original
source,
not
only
shouldn't
he
get
any
money,
but
neither
should
the
government.
isn't
that
the
way
the
statute
reads?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
there
any
other
possible
one?
it
says
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
this
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
brought
by
the
united
states
as
long
as
he's
still
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
it
really
depends
on
whether
you
think
the
language
"if
the
government
proceeds
with
an
action.
"
is
equivalent
to
the
government's
bringing
the
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
it
says
under
3,
what
is
it,
(c)(3)
i
guess,
if
the
elects
not
to
proceed
with
the
action,
the
person
who
initiated
the
action
shall
have
the
right
to
conduct
the
action.
now,
that
suggests
that
if
the
government
intervenes
the
government
is
proceeding
with
the
action,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
different
from
the
government
bringing
the
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
being
very
picky-picky
with
this
text,
considering
that
you're
willing
to
swallow
whole
the
notion
that
so
long
as
the...
so
long
as
the
original
party,
so
long
as
the
non-government
plaintiff
drops
out,
all
of
a
sudden
it
become
as
action
brought
by
the
united
states.
that's
a
very,
very
expansive
notion
of
what
"brought
by
the
united
states"
means.
what
i'm
saying
is
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
if
you
take
your
picky-picky
notion
of
being
brought
by
the
united
states,
to
be
logical
about
it
you
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
if
you
defeat
the
private
plaintiff
under...
under
he's
not
original
source,
the
whole
thing
is
thrown
out,
not
just
his
recovery
but
the
government's
recovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
but
it
would
be
so
extreme
that
we're
not
likely
to
buy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
give
them
any
money,
though.
the
court
doesn't
have
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you'd
then
have
to
pay
his
attorneys'
fees.
that's
what
really
this
is
about,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
factual
theory
of
falsity,
that
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
am,
am
i
correct
that
they
were,
in
fact,
using
that
same
pipe
or
that
same
pipe
system
during
a
period
when
perfectly
fine
cement
blocks
were
being
produced?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
true,
is
that
conceded?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
find
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
unfortunately,
it
was
not
the
criminal
conduct
that
was
ultimately...
it
was
not
the
manner
of
criminal
conduct
that
was
ultimately
the
basis
on
which
the
government
proceeded?
he
knew
about
this
bad
pipe,
right?
or
he
said
that
this
was
a
bad
pipe
system?
he
didn't
say
anything
as
i
understand
it
about
their
not
adding
enough
cement
which
is
the
theory
that
went
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
let
me...
let
me
look
at
what...
let
me
look
at
175.
this
is,
this
what
he
says.
"after
careful
study,
i
concluded
that
the
suggested
process.
"
--this
means
of
piping
the
sludge
out...
"would
result
in
an
unstable
mixture
that
would
later
deteriorate
and
cause
unwanted
release
of
toxic
wastes
to
the
environment.
"
"i
also
noted
based
on
my
analysis
of
chemical
processes
at
rocky
flats
that
that
the
sludge
and
liquid
present
in
the...
present
in
the
evaporation
ponds
contained
some
of
the
most
toxic
and
radioactive
substances
at
rocky
flats.
"
i
mean,
that's
all
very
good,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
this
company
was
convicted
of,
which
is
not...
cutting
down
on
the
amount
of
cement
it
was
adding.
justice
antonin
scalia
during
a
certain
period
after
this
it
was
creating
perfectly
good
blocks
by
adding
more
cement.
then
they
got
a
new
manager
who
said
let's
use
less
cement.
and
that's
when
they
started
producing
the
defective
blocks.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
allegations.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
did
the
government
claim
it
was
insolid?
what
was
the
claim
made
for...
as
to
the
reason
for
the
insolidity?
justice
antonin
scalia
was...
here's
an
easy
question.
was
this
evidence
that
we
read,
his
testimony
from
175
of
the
joint
appendix,
was
that
introduced
at
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
evidence
introduced
from
some
other
source?
was
the
jury
told
there
was
this
piping
that
was
taking
out
too
much
liquid
with
the
sludge?
was
the
jury
told
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
his
central
allegation
was
not
even
placed
before
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
also
said
that
jurisdiction
must
be
maintained
throughout
the
case.
something
like
standing.
we
say
standing
is
examined
throughout
the
trial.
there's
an
easier
standard
at
the
beginning,
and
then
for
the
complaint;
and
then
for
a
motion
to
dismiss,
a
somewhat
higher
standard;
and
finally,
if
the
facts
of...
involving
standing
are
tried,
there's
the
highest
standard
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
jurisdiction
has
to
be
assured
throughout.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
all
very
nice,
but
congress
didn't
leave
it
up
to
you
to
decide
who
ought
to
get
rewarded
or
not.
it
laid
down
some
textual
conditions
in
the
statute.
and
unless
they
are
complied
with,
the
fact
that
you
think
this
is
the
kind
of
person
you
think
ought
to
get
the
money
is
really
totally
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
take
this
case.
did
the
government
use
any
of
the
evidence
that
stone
produced?
did
it
introduce
that
affidavit
which
said
the
pipe
wasn't
working
right?
was
that
part
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
else
had
he
provided
beyond...
did
you
use
anything
that
came
from
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
you
use
at
trial
anything
that
he
provided
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
use
anything
he
provided
you
in
order
to
prove
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
neither
am
i.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
it
possible
to
say
that
he
had
direct
knowledge
of
events
that
occurred
after
he
had
left
rockwell?
i
mean,
all
of
this
failure
occurred
after
he
was
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
only
not
because
of
this
pipe
thing
that
he
predicted
would
cause
a
failure,
not
only
it
was
not
because
of
that.
but
he
was
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and
how
would
he
know
except
from
published
report
that
these
blocks
were
failing?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
prediction
is
not
knowledge.
prediction
is
not
direct
knowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
his
sufficient
information
you
assert
is
his
prediction
that
these
blocks
would
fail
for
a
reason
that
turned
out
not
to
be
the
reason
for
their
failure.
that
is
what
you
say
is
his
direct
knowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
relators
can
get
part
of
the
government's
recovery
even
where
their
initial
allegations
before
the
government
intervenes
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
reason
the
government
is
ultimately
giving
money?
you
think
they
are
still
entitled
to
a
piece
of
the
pie?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
believe
that,
then.
you
think
that
indeed
the
reason
the
government
was
given
the
money
has
to
be
connected
with,
with
his
allegations?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
try
this
hypothetical.
the
relator
says:
i
know
that
they've
been
cheating
the
government
because
i,
i
observed
the
president
of
the
company
going
into
a
meeting
with
the
chief
engineer
and
another
person,
and
at
that
meeting
i
suspect
they
were
devising
this
scheme
to
defraud
the
government.
it
turns
out
there
was
indeed
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
government,
but
that
meeting
never
occurred.
it
wasn't
the
president
of
the
company
who
went
into
the
meeting.
it
was
charlie
chaplin.
and
the
facts
are
totally,
totally
wrong.
does
he
get
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
get
money
just
because
he
came
out
with
the
same
charge
that
the
government
ultimately
proves?
simply
because
he
said
the
company
is
guilty
of
cheating
the
government,
even
though
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
it
are
entirely
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
assume
one
that
just
gets
over
the
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
turns
out
to
be
entirely
wrong.
turns
out
to
be
entirely
wrong,
so
that
the
only
reason
he
believed
this
company
was
defrauding
the
government
was
absolutely
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
response
to
the
government's
assertion,
which
seems
to
me
quite
true,
that
in
order
to...
in
order
to
prevail
it
did
not
have
to
show
why
these
blocks
were
not
solidified?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
had
to
show
that
they
weren't.
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
were
using
his
theory
or
too
little
cement.
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
unites
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
from
1975
through
1989
petitioner
rockwell
international
corporation
was
under
a
management
and
operating
contract
with
the
department
of
energy
to
run
the
rocky
flats
nuclear
weapon’s
plant
in
colorado.
in
the
operation
of
that
plant
there
was
a
toxic
pond
sludge
that
accumulated
in
solar
evaporation
ponds
at
the
facility.
in
the
early
1980s
rockwell
explored
the
possibility
of
disposing
of
this
sludge
by
mixing
it
with
cement.
the
idea
was
to
pour
the
mixture
into
large
rectangular
boxes
where
it
would
solidify
into
what
they
call
“pondcrete”
that
could
be
stored
outside
or
transported
to
other
sites
for
disposal.
respondent’s
stone
who
was
then
employed
as
an
engineer
at
the
plant
predicted
when
this
scheme
was
first
hatched
that
the
proposed
system
for
creating
“pondcrete”
would
not
work
because
of
the
problem
in
the
piping
system.
however,
rockwell
successfully
made
concrete
blocks
and
discovered
what
the
parties
referred
to
as
“insolid
blocks”
only
after
stone
was
laid
off
in
1986.
in
july
1989
stone
filed
a
qui
tam
suit
under
the
false
claims
act.
the
false
claims
act
prohibits
false
or
fraudulent
claims
for
payment
to
the
united
states
and
authorizes
civil
actions
to
remedy
such
fraud
to
be
brought
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
private
individuals
in
the
government’s
name
and
hence
the
name
qui
tam
suits
the
latin
for
who
brings
the
suit
in
his
own
right
as
well
as
in
the
name
of
the
king.
the
act
however
eliminates
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
actions
“based
upon
the
public
disclosure
of
allegations
or
transactions
unless
the
action
is
brought
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
person
bringing
the
action
is
an
original
source
of
the
information.”
an
original
source
is
defined
as
someone
who
“has
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
the
allegations
are
based
and
has
voluntarily
provided
the
information
to
the
government
before
filing
an
action
based
on
the
information.”
stone’s
complaint
alleged
that
in
order
to
induce
the
government
to
make
payments
under
rockwell’s
contract,
rockwell
knowingly
misrepresented
its
compliance
with
numerous
federal
and
state
environmental
laws.
in
1996,
the
government
intervened
in
stone’s
suit
and
along
with
stone
filed
an
amended
complaint.
the
amended
complaint
did
not
alleged
that
stone’s
predicted
piping-system
defect
cause
the
insolid
pondcrete
nor
was
such
defect
mentioned
in
a
statement
of
claims
included
in
the
final
pretrial
order
which
instead
alleged
that
that
“pondcrete”
failed
because
a
new
foreman
used
in
insufficient
cement-to-sludge
ratio.
the
jury
found
for
respondents
with
respect
to
claim’s
covering
the
“pondcrete”
allegations
but
found
for
rockwell
with
respect
to
all
other
claims.
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
stone
is
an
original
source.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
hold
that
respondent
stone
is
not
an
original
source
under
§3730(e)(4)(b)
because
he
does
not
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
his
allegations
are
based.
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court
it
is
conceded
that
the
claims
on
which
stone
prevailed
were
based
upon
publicly
disclosed
allegations
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
question
is
whether
stone
qualifies
under
the
original
source
exception
to
the
public
disclosure
bar.
stone
asserts
that
rockwell
conceded
his
original
source
status.
we
do
not
resolve
that
dispute
because
even
if
rockwell
had
done
so
the
concession
would
have
been
irrelevant
because
section
3730(e)(4)
is
jurisdictional.
turing
to
the
first
requirement
of
original
source
status
that
the
relator
have
“direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
the
allegations
are
based.”
we
conclude
that
the
later
phrase
information
on
which
the
allegations
are
based
refers
to
the
information
on
which
the
reator’s
allegations
are
based
rather
than
the
information
on
which
the
publicly
disclosed
allegations
that
triggered
the
public
disclosure
bar
are
based
if
you
follow.
we
next
conclude
that
the
term
allegations
is
not
limited
to
the
allegation
of
the
original
complaint,
it
includes
at
a
minimum
the
allegations
in
the
original
complaint
as
amended.
here
we
have
not
only
an
amended
complaint
but
a
final
pretrial
order
that
superseded
all
prior
pleadings
and
control
the
subsequent
course
of
the
action.
in
these
circumstances
we
look
to
the
allegations
in
the
final
pretrial
order
to
determine
original
source
status.
judged
according
to
these
principles
stone’s
knowledge
fall
short,
the
only
false
claims
found
by
the
jury
involved
insolid
pondcrete
discovered
after
stone
left
his
employment.
stone
did
know
that
the
pondcrete
failed,
he
predicted
it.
even
if
a
prediction
can
qualify
as
direct
and
independent
knowledge
in
some
cases,
a
point
we
do
not
reach.
it
is
surely
does
not
do
so
when
it
premise
of
course
an
affect
is
wrong.
stone’s
prediction
was
a
failed
prediction
disproved
by
stone’s
own
allegations.
stone
believed
the
piping-system
was
defective
when
in
fact
the
pondcrete
problem
would
be
caused
by
a
foreman’s
action
after
stone
have
left
the
plant.
we
reject
the
argument
that
even
if
stone
fails
the
original
source
test
as
to
his
concrete
allegations,
the
government
intervention
in
his
case
provides
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
the
statute
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
actions
brought
by
a
private
person
under
3730(b)
and
actions
brought
by
the
attorney
general
under
3730(a).
an
action
originally
brought
by
a
private
person,
which
the
attorney
general
has
joined
becomes
an
action
brought
by
the
attorney
general
only
after
the
private
person
has
been
ousted.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
