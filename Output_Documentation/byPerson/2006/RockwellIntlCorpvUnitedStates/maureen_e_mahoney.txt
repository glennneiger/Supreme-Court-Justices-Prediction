ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
correctly
held
that
stone
could
not
share
in
the
award
given
by
the
jury
unless
he
was
an
original
source
of
pondcrete
allegations.
but
it
then
went
on
to
find
that
he
was
an
original
source
based
upon
a
misinterpretation
of
the
core
requirements
of
the
statutory
definition.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
that
is
one
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
the
way
that
the
courts
have
handled
it
below
is
that
it
says
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
unless
it
is
a
claim
brought
by
a
relator
who
is
an
original
source
or
if
it's
brought
by
the
united
states.
and
if
the
relator
drops
out,
i
think
courts
deem
it
to
at
that
point
be
viewed
as
a
claim
brought
by
the
united
states.
it's
sort
of
a
retroactive
amendment
of
the
pleadings.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
it
can't
be,
your
honor,
because
under
the
statutory
terms,
under
section
3720(a)
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
bring
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
authority
for
the
united
states
to
bring
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
relator.
instead
there
is
a
second
type
of
claim
under
section
3730,
and
that's
a
section
(b),
which
authorizes
a
relator
to
bring
a
claim
on
behalf
of
himself
and
the
united
states.
similarly,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
provisions
in
section
(d),
which
authorize
an
award
to
a
relator,
it
requires
that
the
action
be
one
brought
under
section
(b),
that
is
in
other
words
it
be
an
action
brought
by
the
relator
which
the
united
states
then
proceeds
on
for
(d)(1).
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
don't
think
it
can
be,
your
honor,
because
if
you
look
at
the
language
throughout
these
sections,
it
differentiates
between
two
kinds
of
actions,
actions
brought
by
the
united
states
or
the
attorney
general
and
actions
brought
by
the
relator.
and
it
is
only
an
action
brought
by
the
relator
under
section
(b)
that
authorizes
an
award
under
section
(d).
and
it
consistently
talks
about
that.
what
they're
really
arguing,
your
honor,
is
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely.
if
you
look
at,
if
you
look
at
the
language
in
section
(d),
for
instance,
it
says
if
the
government
proceeds
with
an
action
brought
by
a
person
under
section,
subsection
(b).
in
other
words,
it
has
to
be
an
action
under
subsection
(b)
in
order
to
authorize
an
award
at
all.
the
government
has...
has
authority
under
subsection
(a)
to
bring
an
action,
but
it
has
no
authority
to
bring
it
on
behalf
of
the
relator.
the
statute
consistently
uses
these
same
terms,
and
this
court
in
graham
county,
which
was
a
decision
dealing
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
actually
described
this
section
in
the
same
way,
saying
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
actions,
those
that
are
brought
by
the
attorney
general
under
subsection
(a)
and
those
that
are
brought
by
a
relator
under
subsection
(b),
which
the
united
states
can
then
proceed
with.
what
the
relator
is
really
arguing
here
is
that
if
you
look
at
the...
at
subsection
(e)(4),
they're
adding
a
phrase
that's
not
there.
they're
saying
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
over
an
action
under
this
section
if
it
is
brought
by
the
attorney
general
or
brought
by
a
relator
who
is
an
original
source
or
the
united
states
intervenes
and
proceeds
with
the
action.
and
that's
not
in
here.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
of
course
that
would
be
great
for
rockwell,
and
so--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
we
don't
argue
for
that
because
i
think
that
the
court
has
said
that
the
government's
intervention
does
not
cure
defects
with
respect
to
the
relator,
and
therefore,
if
the
relator
didn't
have...
that...
doesn't
have
standing...
you
know,
part
of
this
goes
to
the
issue
of
the
stevens
assignment.
if
they
don't
have
an
assignment,
then
they
don't
even
have
standing
to
be
in
the
action,
they
have
no
right
to
recover.
and
so
if
you're
correct
that
it
can't
be
cured,
in
effect,
through
a
procedure
like,
say,
28--
u.s.c.
section
1553,
which
allows
amendments
to
defective
jurisdictional
allegations
where
i
think
that,
while
the
courts
don't
technically
require
it,
they
could
say
that
really
this,
while
it
was
pled
as
a
section
(b)
action,
when
the
relator
drops
out
we
could
treat
it
as
a
section
(a)
action,
because--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
pragmatic
rule.
but
again,
if
the
rule
is
that
they
lose
as
well,
then
so
be
it.
the
fact
is
this
statute
uses
the
term
that
is
used
in
section
(a),
which
is
"brought
by
the
united
states".
and
it
makes
perfect
sense
because
otherwise
think
of
what
the
consequences
are
if
the
relator
can
simply
copy
an
indictment,
file
a
complaint,
and
say...
and
the
government
intervenes
because
it's
a
major
action,
and
then
they
say,
aha,
you're
stuck
with
me
because
you've
intervened
and
now
there's
jurisdiction
and
there's
no
problem,
i
don't
have
to
be
an
original
source.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
could
say
that
they
don't
have
to
give
them
money.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
it
is
about
that,
but
we
don't
have
to
pay
his
attorneys'
fees,
your
honor,
if
he
doesn't
get
a
share,
because
the
way
that
section
(d)
is
written
is
it
says
that
a
relator
who
is
paid
a
share
of
the
proceeds
shall
also
be
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
so
this
is
not
just
an
issue
between
the
united
states
and
stone.
the
statute
controls
the
award
of
fees
based
upon
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
share.
so
even
if
this
weren't
an
issue
of
jurisdiction,
if
he's
not
entitled
to
a
share
under
a
section
(d)(1),
then
he's
also
not
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
and
therefore,
we
would
win.
he
would
still
need
to...
whether
it's
a
jurisdictional
rule
or
a
substantive
rule,
if
he's
not
an
original
source
he's
out.
but
the
share
is
not
the
only
issue
that
makes
the
government's...
or
that
makes
stone's
argument
implausible
here.
that
is
that
once
the
relator
is
in
the
action,
the
united
states
can't
get
them
out
of
the
action.
even
if
they
don't
have
to
pay
them
money,
under
subsection
(c)
they
have
a
whole
range
of
rights
to
participate
in
the
action.
they
can't
dismiss
the
relator.
so
it
makes
no
sense
to
read
this
statute
to
say
that
someone
who
copies
an
indictment,
files
a
complaint,
the
government
intervenes,
they're
in
there
forever.
it
instead
makes
much
more
sense
to
read
the
terms
the
way
they're
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
to
mean
that
there
is
only
jurisdiction
if
it
is
a
section--
(a)
claim
brought
by
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
itself
or
if
it
is
a
section
b)
claim
by
a
relator
that
is
an
original
source.
that's
what
makes
sense
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
tenth
circuit
correctly
held
that
stone
had
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
his
allegations
were
based.
it
bears
emphasis
that
every
act
that
he
had
to
prove
in
order
to
recover
on
the
pondcrete
allegations...
whether
they're
measured
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
or
the
end
of
the
case
doesn't
matter...
every
single
act
occurred
after
he
left
the
plaintiff,
after
he
had
left
his
job.
and
we
can
see
that
from
the
outset
of
the
case.
if
you
look
at
his
responses
to
interrogatories
at
ja-189
to
190,
he
identifies
the
factual
basis
for
the
pondcrete
allegations
that
he
is
asserting.
and
that
factual
basis
is
described
he
is
asserting
and
that
factual
basis
is
described
as
rockwell's
knowing
storage
of
pondcrete
on
outdoor
pads
at
the
plant
in
violation
of
rcra
with
false
certification
from
1987
to
1989.
now,
he
left
his
job
in
march
of
1986.
how
could
he
possibly
have
direct
and
independent
knowledge
of
those
predicate
acts?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
perhaps,
your
honor,
in
certain
circumstances.
i
think
the
key
question
is
what's
the
standard,
and
he
has
to
have
substantial
knowledge
about
core
fraudulent
acts.
and
it
may
be
reasonable
in
your
hypothetical
or
some
others
to
infer
that
he
knew
plenty
about
this
fraudulent
conduct
and
had
plenty
of
reason
to
conclude
that
it
was
continuing
on.
but
here,
your
honor,
nothing
of
the
kind
happened.
he
didn't
know
about
any
fraudulent
conduct
pertaining
to
pondcrete
before
he
left.
and
in
fact,
his
allegations
start
in
1987.
he
does
not
say
that
there
were
pondcrete
violations
before
then
and
indeed
there
were
not.
the
reason
there
weren't
is
because
when
he
was
at
the
plant
rockwell
was
producing
hard
pondcrete,
hard
pondcrete,
and
it
wasn't
storing
it
on
site,
it
was
shipping
it
to
nevada.
so
he
couldn't...
and
it
wasn't
even
clear
that
it
was
subject
to
rcra
because
doe
didn't
enter
into
a
rcra
compliance
agreement
until
after
he
left.
he
also
concedes
in
his
deposition
that
he
was
not,
except
with
one
exception...
he
was
not
aware
of
any
time
when
rockwell
affirmatively
represented
that
it
was
in
compliance
with
environmental
safety
and
health
provisions
when
it
was
not.
that's
ja-106.
so
he
didn't...
unlike
your
hypothetical,
he
didn't
know
anything
about
there
being
a
pondcrete
fraud
prior
to
the
time
of
his
departure
and
doesn't
even
allege
one.
instead,
what
the
tenth
circuit
rested
upon
was
the
fact
that
he
had
reviewed
a
design
for
making
pondcrete
5
years...
in
fact,
not
for
making
pondcrete;
it
was
actually
a
design
for
removing
sludge
from
the
ponds...
5
years
before
any
of
the
events
at
issue
here,
and
he
said
he
predicted
there
would
be
a
design
problem.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
every
court
that
has
considered
that
question
has
said
that
it
has
to
be
analyzed
on
what
they
call
a
claim
by
claim
basis.
let
me
explain
the
reason.
first
of
all,
let
me
explain
what
they
mean
by
claim
by
claim.
they
really
mean
a
factual
theory
of
falsity,
and
that
it
has
to
be
done
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
and
here's
why--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--a
theory
of
falsity.
in
other
words,
a
claim,
what
is
called
a
claim
in
these
cases
in
the
claim
by
claim
analysis
is
a
theory
of
falsity.
in
other
words,
it's
why
were...
why
was
the
fraudulent
claim
false?
because
there
may
be
a
certification,
for
instance,
of
compliance
with
let's
say
all
laws
and
there
could
be
five
different,
completely
different
fact
patterns
as
to
why
that
was
false,
and
the
damages
might
be
completely
differ
as
well.
so
all
of
the
courts
have
said
that's
really
the
way
that
fca
cases
are
litigated,
that's
really
what
we
call
a
claim.
and
then,
moving
back,
if
you
didn't
do
it
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
you
would
allow
a
relator
to
copy
an
indictment
that
he
knows
nothing
about,
come
to
court,
file
it,
add
one
theory
that
he
does
know
about,
an
overcharge
for
five
dollars
on
a
hammer,
say
that,
i'm
now
entitled
to
proceed
on
the
whole
thing
and
if
the
government
doesn't
intervene
i
get
a
minimum
of
25
percent
of
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
determined
after
the
case
is
over.
these
inquiries
should...
it
should
have
been
determined
here
as
well
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case.
and
it
was.
it
was
just
determined
wrong.
we
do
not
have
to
show
that
it
was
wrong
at
the
end
of
the
trial
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case.
it
was
wrong
at
the
beginning.
the
interrogatories--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor
but
it
is
not
by
any
means
necessary
to
the
outcome
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
why
i
think
that
you
do
have
to
at
least
allow
for
the
possibility
of
looking
at
the
end
of
the
case,
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
or
not,
is
because
of
the
nature
of
this
particular
jurisdictional
bar.
this
is
a
jurisdictional
bar
that
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
allegations
at
issue
in
the
case.
much
like...
i
think
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
a
perfect
example
because
it
too
talks
about
jurisdiction
being
predicated
on,
for
instance,
commercial...
claims
that
are
based
upon
commercial
activity.
suppose
that
the
plaintiff
at
the
outset
of
the
case
when
the
12(b)(1)
motion
is
filed
posits
one
theory
of
the
case
that
involves
a
predicate
commercial
act.
but
when
it
gets
to
trial
he's
abandoned
that
theory
and
now
he
doesn't
have
any
commercial
act.
surely
the
court
would
say
you
have
to
satisfy
jurisdiction
over
the
theory
that
has
actually
gone
to
trial.
this
statute
is
very
much
the
same.
and
it
should
not
be
read
in
a
way
that
allows
relators
to
simply
disguise
the
true
basis
of
their
claims,
hide
the
relevance
of
the
public
information,
and
then
just
shift
gears
when
you
get
to
trial.
but
here
again,
if
we
just
look
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case,
he
does
identify
in
those
interrogatory
responses,
for
instance,
what
the
factual
basis
for
the
pondcrete
allegations
are.
all
that
factual
basis
is
all
identified
as...
as
core
acts
that
occurred
after
he
left
the
plant.
so
we
can
look
back
in
this
case
and
say
that
the
trial
court
erred
at
the
outset
by
not
dismissing
this
portion
of
his
claim
as
well
as,
in
fact,
should
have
dismissed
the
whole
thing,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because,
your
honor,
this,
this
is
a
statute
about
fraud.
it's
not
a
statute
that's
violated
because
rockwell
may
have
had
a
suboptimal
pipe.
that's
not,
that's
not
even
the
rcra
violation.
that's
not...
and
it
is
certainly
not
a
false
claims
act
violation.
they
weren't
selling
pondcrete
to
the
united
states.
he
didn't
know
about
a
plan
to
defraud
the
united
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
at
that,
at
the
time--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--at
the
time
that
he
was
there
that
was
not
actually...
he
didn't
even
allege
that
he
knew
they
were
doing
that
with
respect
to
pondcrete.
he
didn't
allege
that
there
were
any
problems
with
respect
to
the
pondcrete
production
or,
or
certifications
during
his
tenure.
from...
they
began
producing
pondcrete
in
1985,
your
honor.
and
there
were
no
problems
that
were
alleged
with
respect
to
that
pondcrete.
his
claim
by
his
own
admission
starts
in
1987,
after
he
was
gone.
and
again,
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
defective
pipe
wouldn't
establish
the
rcra
violation,
because
what
they
had
to
show
by
their
owning
pleading
here
was
that
they
were
storing
it
on
site,
that
it
was
actually
leaking,
and,
of
course,
the
mere
fact
there
may
have
been
a
problem
with
the
pipe
doesn't
mean
it
is
actually
going
to
leak,
because
they
can
fix
it
in
a
variety
of
ways.
they
can
add
more
cement,
they
can
put
it
in
metal
containers,
they
can
do
a
myriad
of
things.
he
didn't
even
say
he
knew
know
that
there
was
a
plan
to
not
remedy
and
problems
in
the
design
that
he
had
identified
if
and
when
there
became
a
problem
with
it.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
we
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
think
that
it's
conceded
that...
well,
their
own
counsels
told
the
jury
that
they
were
making
it
wrong,
they
weren't
adding
enough
cement,
that
that
was
the
reason
that
it
was
failing;
and
the
government
told
the
jury
that
they
were
making
it
fine
until
they
reduced
the
ratio
of
cement.
so
yes,
i
think
it
is
correct
that
it
has
been
conceded
at
trial
that
the
system
was
working
fine
as
long
as
they
were
adding
enough
cement.
but
instead
what
happens
after
he
left--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
the
statute
isn't
written
in
that
way.
but
let
me
also
call
your
attention
to
some
facts.
and
that
is
that
a
year
before
he
brought
this
claim--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if...
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
a
trigger
for
the
government
discovery
of
a
different
problem,
no,
that
is
not
a
basis
for
recovery.
the
statute
says
that
if
there
has
been
a
public
disclosure,
if...
let's
assume
there
was
a
public
disclosure.
if
there's
no
public
disclosure
it
is
no
problem.
he
can
bring
whatever
claim
he
wants.
he
doesn't
have
to
have
direct
knowledge
of
it.
bit
if
there
has
been
a
public
disclosures
at
that
point
he
has
to
have
direct
knowledge
of
the
information
on
which
the
allegations
are
based.
and
that
has
to
be
a
substantial
standard.
direct
knowledge
is
one
of
the
key
things
that
the
tenth
circuit
just
did
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--on
which
the
allegations
of
the
claim
is
based.
in
other
words,
it,
it's
not...
it
has
to
be...
and
the
government
says
this
as
well...
they
say
under
that
section
d(1),
the
relator
isn't
entitled
to
share
in
the
proceeds
of
anything
that
the
jury
gives.
the
relator
is
only
entitled
to
share
in
the
proceeds
of
a
claim
for
which
they
were
an
original
source
or
for
which
they
brought
the...
brought
the
action
under,
under
section
b.
sometimes
the
government
intervenes
and
adds
its
own
claims
not
on
behalf
of
the
relator,
because
it
doesn't
have
authority
on
behalf
of
the
relator,
and
it
takes
the
position,
i
think
correctly,
that
the
relator
isn't
entitled
to
a
share
in
those
circumstances.
and
your
honor,
this...
the
courts
have
identified
all
the
ways
in
which
this
statute
doesn't
make
any
sense
if
it
is
looked
at
on--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--on
a
global
basis.
excuse
me?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
i
don't
think
they
have
identified
them
all.
but
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i,
i
would
also...
again,
it
would
allow
the
relator
to
get,
you
know,
a
share
of,
when
the
government
doesn't
intervene,
a
minimum
of
25
percent
of
a
billion
dollar
recovery
after
a
public
disclosure
that
he
knew
nothing
about,
if
he
just
knew
one
little
piece
after
separate
theory
of
fraud.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well
it
there,
if
there's
a
minor
variation,
you
know,
something
like
that,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
disqualifies
the
relator
from,
from
being
an
original
source.
and
again,
here
he
wasn't
an
original
source
even
under
his
own
theory
at
the
outset
of
the
case.
what
happened
at
trial
is
the
one
little
thing
that
he
knew
or
claimed
to
know,
his
prediction
that
a
pipe
would
have
a
problem
five
years
before,
was
dropped
completely
from
the
case.
so
he
went
from
being
a
relator
who
knew
something
very
small
about
the
case
or
about
the
theories
to
nothing
at
all.
it
was
never
good
enough,
but
certainly
once,
once
that
theory
was...
once
that
piece
of
information
dropped
out,
it
just
demonstrated,
it
just
highlights
that
he's
not
an
original
source.
and
your
honor,
here
it
wasn't
just
that
they
didn't
want
to
use
that
bit
of
evidence.
it
was
actually
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
they,
that
they
pressed
with
the
jury.
they
said
the
equipment
was
fine.
rockwell
was
making
pondcrete
just
fine
from
1985
forward
until
it
stopped
adding
the
cement.
and
that's
what
they...
that's
the
theory
they
went
with.
but
again,
measure
it
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
and
he
still
wasn't
an
original
source.
if
i
could
save
the
remainder
of
my
time?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
public...
there...
the
public
disclosure
was
in
19...
it
can
be
from
several
pieces.
but
in
1988,
there
were
widely
covered
stories
of
the
fact
that
pondcrete
was
being
stored
at
rocky
flats
on
outdoor
pads,
that
it
was
leaking
and
that
the
reason
it
was
occurring
was
because
the
employees
had
reduced
the
ratio
of
cement.
and
then
you
couple
that
with
the
disclosure--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct.
it
was
in
the
newspapers.
but
it
was
definitely
covered,
your
honor.
and
that
was
more
than
a
year
before
he
brought
his
action.
and
then
in
addition,
there
were
disclosures
of
allegations
of
performance
bonuses
being
paid
based
upon
falsified
evaluations.
that's
ja
143.
thank
you.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
would
like
to
first
just
address,
the
government's
suggested
that
he
could
be
an
original
source
because
he
had
knowledge
of
false
representations
and
concealments
derived
throughout
his
employment.
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
rely
on
that
theory,
said
that
he
did
not
have
to
have
knowledge
of
any
fraudulent
acts.
it
was
just
enough
that
he
knew
something
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
proof
of
an
environmental
violation.
and
the
reason
that
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
was
because
stone
had
conceded
in
his
deposition
at
pages
ja-106
and
112
that
he
did
not
know
about
any
false
representations
and
he
did
not
know
whether
doe
was
aware
of
any
of
the
environmental
problems.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
what--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
point
is
that
mr.
stone
wasn't
there
when
the
manufacturing
problems
occurred,
so
he
didn't
actually
have
direct
knowledge
that
pondcrete
was
leaking.
that's
the
real
point.
what
they're
really
saying
is
that
his
theory
about
why
it
might
leak
some
day
didn't
turn
out
to
be
important
to
the
gravamen
of
the
claim.
this
is
a
fraud
claim.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
fraud
and
he
couldn't
have
known
they
were
leaking
at
the
time,
5
years
later
because
he
wasn't
there.
and
the
statute
requires
direct
knowledge.
the
government's
suggestion
that
somehow
rule
11
will
be
the
basis
on
which
we
can
sort
out
who's
an
original
source
and
who's
not
strikes
me
as
rather
odd.
first
of
all,
nothing
hardly
ever
gets
dismissed
on
rule
11
grounds.
and
this
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
that
requires
direct
knowledge.
a
relator
could
read
an
indictment
and
satisfy
rule
10
just
by
copying
the
allegations.
does
that
count?
i
think
that
direct
knowledge
means
there
can't
be
undue
conjecture.
the
only
thing
that
he
said
he
knew,
even
though
it
wasn't
the
gravamen
of
the
claim,
was
clearly
based
upon
conjecture,
a
belief
that
in
his
opinion
this
pipe
would
not
work.
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
trial,
there
were
55
witnesses.
stone
had
not
identified
a
single
one
of
them
as
a
person
with
relevant
knowledge
at
the
outset
of
the
case
when
he
answered
his
interrogatory
responses.
in
addition,
every
person...
no
person
he
identified
testified
at
the
case.
he
identified
four
documents
that
he
said
were
key.
none
of
them
were
introduced.
he
knew
nothing
about
what
went
to
trial.
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
"voluntarily
provide".
that
is
a
separate
ground
for
reversal
in
this
case,
and
would
emphasize
that
the
tenth
circuit
said
the
engineering
order
that
refers
to
removal
of
sludge
and
says
in
my
opinion
this
won't
work,
that's
all
it
says...
the
tenth
circuit
says
that's
fine.
the
district
court
made
a
factual
finding
that
stone
had
not
communicated
his
concerns
to
the
government
about
pondcrete,
saltcrete,
or
spray
irrigation,
the
three
theories
issues
at
issue
at
trial
here.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
what
they're
referring
to
is
the
affidavit,
i
think.
he
filed
an
affidavit
at
the
outset
of
the
case
when
rockwell
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
tried
to
do
a
new
one
10
years
later
that
was
rejected.
thank
you
very
much.
