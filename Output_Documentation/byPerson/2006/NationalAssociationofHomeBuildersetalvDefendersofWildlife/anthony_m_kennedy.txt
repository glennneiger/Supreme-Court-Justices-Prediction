justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
take
the
case
and...
i'll
ask
the
same
question
to
your
colleagues
from
the
other
side...
on
the
assumption
that
if
the
nine...
the
factors
in
the
statutes
are
met,
that
epa
has
no
discretion
to
withhold
the
transfer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
the
consultation
does
beyond
the
nine
factors
that
are
listed
in
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
beyond
the
nine
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
understand
that.
but
when
they
sit
down
and
they
have
the
consultation,
is
it
proper
for
the
epa
to
say
now,
we're
consulting
with
you,
but
only
with
respect
to
the
nine
factors,
as
to
permits
that
are
issued
by
the
states
afterwards,
but
then
that's
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
epa's
saying
what
i've
said
in
my
hypothetical
instance?
if
they...
they
say
we're
going
to
consult
with
you
but
we
want
to
make
it
clear
we're
only
talking
about
the
nine
factors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you
are
at
issue
with
the
government
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
epa
can
protect
the
plants
when
the
permit
is
under
its
own
jurisdiction,
why
can't
it
use
that
same
basis
for
objecting
when
it's
under
the
state's
jurisdiction?
