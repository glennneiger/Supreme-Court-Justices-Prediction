chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
06-340,
national
association
of
home
builders
versus
defenders
of
wildlife,
and
06-549,
environmental
protection
agency
versus
defenders
of
wildlife.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
the
consultation
is
a
waste
of
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
glitzenstein?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
quite
right.
they
would
look
at
that
in
the
context
of
reviewing
the
permits
that
are
issued
by
the
state
agencies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
what
he's
suggesting
is
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
impact
on
any
endangered
species
until
a
particular
permit
is
issued
by
the
state
agency,
and
that
those
permits
are
submitted
to
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
their
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
point...
the
point
is
that
it's
the
issuance
of
a
permit
under
the
program,
whether
administered
by
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
that
has
the
potential
for
jeopardizing
endangered
species.
it
is
not
the
administration
of
the
program.
and
epa
has
in
place
the
procedures
to
allow
them
to
review
the
particular
permits,
which
what
is
what
might
jeopardize
an
endangered
species.
and
they
don't
need
to
leverage
their
limited
authority,
their
non-discretionary
authority
to
approve
a
transfer,
to
have
that
authority
to
review
the
actual
act
that
might
jeopardize
an
endangered
species.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
is...
is
there
any
limitation?
let's
say
that
epa
says
we're
all
set
to
approve
this
transfer,
except
osha
sent
us
a
letter
and
they
don't
like
the
occupational
safety
rules
you
have
at
the
state
environmental
agency;
so
until
you
change
those
rules,
or
enter
a
memorandum
of
agreement
that
you're
going
to
change
those
rules,
we're
not
going
to
approve
the
transfer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
like
the
osha
act.
it
says,
you
know,
the
states
should
do
this,
and
they're
not
doing
it.
so
epa
can
leverage
their
approval
into
any
area
of
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
sometimes
states
say
no.
so
if
they
say
no,
presumably
they're
going
to
have
to
impose
the
obligation
as
a
condition
of
approval.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
jeopardy
from
the
issuance
of
a
prospective
future
issuance
of
a
permit
by
arizona
if
they
get
the
delegated
authority.
and
that
issuance
of
the
permit
would
be
subject
to
objection
and
review
by
epa
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
position
that
epa
has
taken.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
their
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
does
it
matter
whether
they
have
it
or
if
it's
transferred
to
arizona?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
opinions
in
two
of
our
cases
this
morning.
