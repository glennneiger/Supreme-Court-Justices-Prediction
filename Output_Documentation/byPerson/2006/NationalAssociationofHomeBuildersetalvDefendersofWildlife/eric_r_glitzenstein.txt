mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
particularly
start
off
with
the
memorandum
of
agreement
that
was
just
being
discussed,
and
to,
i
think,
at
least
try
to
clarify
an
answer,
i
think,
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
compliance
with
that
memorandum
of
agreement.
if
you
look
at
page
260
of
the
nahb
appendix
that
was
filed
along
with
the
petition,
one
of
the
elements
of
that
memorandum
of
agreement
is
that
there
would
be
compliance
with
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act
when
there
were
transfer
decisions
being
made
by
the
epa.
and--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--this
is
page
260.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
of
the
nahb
appendix,
which
is...
there
are
two
volumes
of
that
appendix,
justice
scalia.
volume
one
was
pages
1
to
317,
which
is
the
white
cover
volume,
and
i
can
quote
from
the
paragraph
that
i
was
referring
to.
and
it's
the
first
full
paragraph
and
it
reads--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--260,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
260,
around.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
and
it's
the
first
full
paragraph
and
it
says:
"epa's
current
practice
is
to
consult
with
the
services
where
epa
determines
that
approval
of
a
state's
or
a
tribe's
application
to
administer
the
npdes
program
may
affect
federally
listed
species.
"
and
they
actually
complied
with
that
memorandum
of
agreement
in
this
case
when
they
consulted
in
response
to
the
arizona
application.
now,
this
memorandum
of
agreement
which
mr.
kneedler
just
represented
to
the
court
is
continuing
to
be
complied
with,
specifically
provides
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
clean
water
act
and
the
endangered
species
act
will
be
reconciled
and
will
be
harmonized.
this
language
was
adopted
after
notice
and
comment
proceedings.
it
is
reflected
not
only
in
the
application
and
the
final
decision
made
in
this
case,
where
once
again
the
epa
said
point
blank,
we
are
required
to
comply
with
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act;
but
essentially
the
same
understanding
of
the
agency's
legal
duties
and
how
they
would
be
reconciled
was
set
forth
in
all
these
past
consultation
decisions
that
are
described
in
the
decisions
below
and
our
brief.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
there's
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
memorandum
of
agreement
that
says
that.
but
can
i
just
add
a
critical
point
on
that,
justice
scalia?
the
government's
position
now
is
that
it
doesn't
matter.
their
new
position
in
response
to
justice
stevens's
question
about
the
change
in
position,
before
the
government
came
to
this
court,
they
never
previously
suggested
what
they're
now
saying,
which
is
that
section
7(a)(2)
consultation
obligations
and
the
no-jeopardy
prohibition
don't
apply
at
all
to
these
transfer
decisions.
so
this
distinction
between
aquatic
species
and
upland
species,
which
may
be
an
interesting
one
to
explore,
we
would
submit
on
remand,
is
not
the
current
reflection
of
their
position.
their
position
now
is
we
could
have
something
causing
the
extinction
of
aquatic
species
as
a
result
of
a
pollution
impact
but
we
are
under
no
obligation
to
even
take
a
look
at
that
under
the
seemingly
mandatory
requirement
of
section
7.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
where
we
seem
to
have
a
little
bit
of
a
disconnect.
the
assumption
that
mr.
kneedler
seems
to
be
making
is
the
end
of
the
consultation
process
that
section
7
requires,
not
the
beginning
of
it.
the
purpose
of
the
consultation
process
is
to
avoid
conflicts
with
other
statutory
obligations,
note
to
create
them,
and
indeed
as
that
memorandum
of
agreement
language
suggests,
the
consultation
process
has
been
used
precisely--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
to
go
back
to
the
suggestion
that
i
think
justice
souter
made,
what
the
agencies
have
done
in
the
past,
and
this
is
a
situation
where
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
whether
the
agencies
can
comply
with
those
statutes.
they
have
done
it.
they've
worked
these
problems
out.
and
what
they
have
done
when
they've
consulted,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
underlying
consultation
documents,
they've
spelled
out
exactly
what
your
honor
just
suggested
should
be
the
approach.
they've
said,
all
right,
when
we
issue
these
permits
under
section
402...
under
402(b)
and
do
we
exercise
our
oversight
responsibilities
under
402(d),
here
are
the
species
we
are
going
to
pay
special
attention
to.
for
example,
in
the
maine
delegation,
one
of
the
principal
species
of
concern
was
the
atlantic
salmon,
which
they
were
concerned
about
because
of
impacts
from
the
aquaculture
industry.
what
they
did
in
the
biological
opinion
prepared
as
a
consequence
of
that
consultation
was
not
say,
we're
not
going
to
let
this
transfer
go
through.
they
said
we
have
this
oversight
ability.
we're
going
to
work
out
with
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
the
mechanism
by
when
those
permits
come
to
our
attention,
as
they
must
under
section
402(d),
we
will
discuss
the
circumstances
and
criteria
for
objecting
to
those,
we
will
go
to
the
state
under
the
following
circumstances,
and
say
we
think
this
permit
is
going
to
cause
the
jeopardy
of
the
species--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
and
again--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--and
i
guess
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court's
fundamental
obligation
when
it
has
two
statutes
that
have
shall
provisions,
is
to
see
if
there's
a
way
they
can
be
reconciled
and
worked
out.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
consultation
process
has
been
and
should
be
precisely
the
process
where
those
kinds
of
issues
will
be
reconciled
and
that's
exactly
how
this
process
is
working.
so
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
say
let's
not
use
the
process
that
7(a)(2)
calls
for,
in
order
to
try
to
avoid
the
problems,
is
to
really
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
in
the
most,
i
think,
obvious
way
imaginable.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
right.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
i
think,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
critical.
i
think
we're
making
some
assumptions
here
that,
at
least
on
our
side,
we're
not
making.
we're
not
assuming
that
the
outcome
of
the
consultation
process
has
to
be
to
impose
new
conditions
on
the
state.
one
of
the
outcomes
of
the
prior
consultation
process
with
maine,
with
texas,
for
example,
was
to
spell
out
how
the
service
and
epa
would
address
their
post-transfer
concerns.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
with
all
deference,
your
honor,
it
says:
"the
current
practice
to
consult
with
the
services
where
epa
determines
that
approval
of
a
state's
or
tribe's
application
to
administer
the
program.
"
"and
i
think
there
is
concession
by
the
other
side
that
that
in
fact
was
a
reflection
of
what
the
practice
was.
"
"they
were
consulting
on
the
actual
transfer
of
the
programs,
and
the
reason
they
were
doing
that,
chief
justice
roberts,
was
to
do
exactly
what
your
honor
is
suggesting,
that
is
to
work
out
a
mechanism
beforehand,
so
that
when
the
state
permits
are
being
issued,
the
agencies
would
know
how
to
address
their
concerns.
"
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
again
i
think
what
the
court
may
be
doing
is
assuming
that
this
consultation
process
is
somewhat
more
draconian
than
it
frequently
turns
out
to
be.
if
the
only
outcome
of
the
consultation
process
under
section
7(a)(2)
is
for
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
to
reach
some
understanding
with
epa,
it
says
when
these
permits
are
issued
by
the
states,
here
are
the
circumstances
under
which
you're
going
to
lodge
objections,
because
we're
the
expert
agency
on
species.
and
i
think
this
record
shows
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
consultation
goes
to
the
separate
obligation
under
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
to
address
the
impacts
on
a
listed
species.
and
if
i
could--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--i
don't
think...
i
think
what
it
is
is
an
effort,
as
there's
been
discussion
here,
to
reconcile
two
obligations,
both
of
which
congress
felt
were
important.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
agency
has
done
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
well,
and
your
honor,
just
on
that
point,
i
found
the
government's
reply
brief
a
little
bit
odd,
because
i
think
consistent
with
the
questioning
from
justice
breyer,
it
acknowledges
for
the
first
time
that
these
factors
do
encompass
some
consideration
of
wildlife
impacts.
but
putting
that
to
one
side,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
compare
what
they're
arguing
now
with
how
they
dealt
with
other
cross-cutting
legal
obligations.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
how
they
dealt
with
the
indian
trust
responsibility...
i'm
only
bringing
this
up
by
way
of
analogy,
because
i
think
the
government's
position
is,
oh,
we're
trying
to
elevate
the
endangered
species
act
to
some
exalted
status,
and
in
fact
all
we're
saying
on
this
administrative
record
is
that's
the
same
status
that
they
accorded
to
other
cross-cutting
legal
obligations.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
i
think
that
my
argument
is
that
the
endangered
species
act
on
its
face
says
that
it
prohibits
jeopardy
or
the
result
of
habitat
destruction,
critical
habitat
destruction,
for
any
agency
action
that
is
authorized,
funded
or
carried
out.
our
view
is
that
they
should
first
look
to
the
clean
water
act
criteria
and
factors.
we
think--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--we
are,
your
honor.
what
i
will
say
to
you,
with
all
respect,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
reason
i
bring
up
their
other
legal
obligations,
and
i
think
it
also
reinforces
the
value
of
a
remand
in
this
case,
so
some
of
the
issues
raised
by
the
government's
new
position
would
be
flushed
out
in
the
administrative
process.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix,
page
203,
when
native
american
tribes
wrote
to
the
agency
and
said
we
are
concerned
about
the
impact
of
this
transfer
on
native
american
historic
properties
and
cultural
and
religious
attributes,
the
epa
did
not
write
back
and
say
well,
we're
sorry,
native
american
tribes,
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
nine
criteria.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
i
think
the
line,
your
honor,
is
whether
you've
got
another
crosscutting
obligation--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--again,
your
honor,
i
think
the
first
problem
is,
with
that
question
is
that,
i
don't
mean
to
be
evasive,
but
i
think
the
problem
is
you're
assuming
the
outcome
of
the
analysis,
which
is
that
they'll
have
to
impose
some
new
condition
on
the
state.
with
the
native
american
tribes,
they
didn't
do
that.
they
didn't
impose
any
condition
on
the
state.
they
said
we'll
have
an
agreement
with
the
native
american
tribes
that
when
we
exercise
our
oversight
authority,
we
will
look
at
the
impact
upon--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--yeah.
and
what
i
will
say,
your
honor,
is
we
think
that
in
the
past
they
have
been
able
to
work
these
problems
out.
but
if
they
can't,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
congress
created
a
mechanism
precisely
for
the
very
rare
situation
where
there
is--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
well,
i
think
you
can.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
i
think
that's
a
good
summary
of
what
has
happened
with
these
consultations,
and
on
the
cactus--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--well,
i
think
the
concern
i
would
have
is
that
i
think
it
goes
beyond
what's
necessary
here
because
we're
not
dealing,
everybody
agrees,
with
some
purely
ministerial
situation
like
that
one.
i
think
the
other
critical
factor
here,
your
honor,
that
we
haven't
talked
about,
is
the
funding
of
this
program.
and
it's
very
interesting
when
the
government
points
out,
if
i
can
just
get
across
to
the
court
i
think
a
critical
citation,
because
the
government
says
funding
is
not
before
us.
and
the
reason
they
say
that
is
because
it
didn't
need
to
be
before
us
when
they
took
the
position
that
authorization
of
the
program
was
sufficient
to
trigger
their
consultation
duties.
and
in
a
footnote
in
their
reply
brief,
they
say
pay
no
attention
to
funding,
which
is
of
course
a
discretionary
activity,
because
that's
completely
separate
from
the
decision
to
authorize.
if
you
look
at
40
c.f.r.
section
123.23(3),
and
i
apologize...
this
is
a
response
to
their
reply
brief
point
so
there's
not
any
appendix
before
the
court...
but
it
specifically
provides
that
funding
opportunities
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
decision
to
authorize
the
program.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
funding
of
the
npdes
program
carried
out
by
arizona
that
had
to
be
approved
in
order
to
allow--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--they
have
to...
there's
a...
section
106
of
the
clean
water
act
provides
the
epa
with
an
opportunity,
and
it's
certainly
not
mandatory,
to
provide
funding
to
a
state.
and
this
is
40
percent
federal...
we're
not
talking
about
de
minimis
funding.
so
it's
one
thing
for
the
state
to
say
well,
it
should
get
the
program.
it's
another
thing
to
say
funding.
and
just
to
be
clear
about
this,
this
is
an
argument
we're
making
to
reinforce
the
propriety
of
remand
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
well,
we
suggest,
your
honor...
and
i
think
this
goes
back
to
justice
stevens's
question
about
the
change
in
position.
i
think
we're
in
an
odd
position
in
this
court
quite
frankly
because
we
have
an
administrative
record
where
the
administrator
conceded
a
duty
to
comply
with
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act.
we
have
a
new
position
here
saying
they
don't.
and
we
think
funding
and
the
other
example
you
came
up
with
is
a
good
reason
why
a
common
sense
result
in
this
case
is
to
say
we
have
a
change
in
position,
there
are
new
issues
brought
to
the
fore.
as
a
consequence
of
that--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--we
have--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
let
me
be
clear
about
that.
we
never
conceded
that.
what
happened--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--i
think
that
there
are
actually
arguments
that,
especially
with
regard
to
the
wildlife
related
parts
of
the
criteria,
that
are
not
satisfied.
let
me...
let
me
try
to
explain
why
we
didn't
feel
it
necessary
to
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
if
i
can
give
your
honor
some
citations
to
the
record,
i
think
it
will
help
answer
that.
on
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
biologists,
the
expert
agency
employees,
said
that
there
would
be
significant
effects
to
survival
and
recovery
of
listed
species
through
a
destruction,
degradation
and
fragmentation
of
habitats.
they
specifically
pinpointed
the
flycatcher,
the
southwestern
willow
flycatcher
is
a
species
that
could
be
devastated.
that's
at
page--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
the
concern
that
they
had
was
that
the
mechanism
that
had
been
used
to
protect
these
wildlife
species,
and
particularly
plant
species,
which
i
want
to
get
to
in
a
moment,
because
i
think
actually
the
concern
is
even
greater
with
plants,
was
that
the
consultation
on
federally
issued
permits
had
in
effect
been
used,
and
this
was
not
conjectural,
they
had
been
used
to
safeguard
considerable
habitat
for
these
species.
and
if
i
could
turn
actually
to
the
water
level,
which
is
i
think
actually
our
best
example,
and--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
it
is
not
a
question
of
trusting
them.
i
think
part
of
the
outcome
of
the
consultation--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--yes,
your
honor.
the
burden
is
on
the
agency
in
the
consultation
process.
and
it's
at,
as
tva
versus
hill
makes
clear,
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
is
accorded
to
the
species.
but,
could
i
try
to
answer
that
question?
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
we're
not
saying
we
don't
trust
the
state.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
outcomes
of
one
these
prior
consultation
processes
has
been
where
it's
appropriate,
the
service
works
had
an
agreement
with
the
state
where
it
says
here
are
our
concerns
where
the
expert
federal
agency,
we
listed
these
species,
you
didn't.
part
of
it's
expertise,
not
trust.
and
in
fact,
if
the
state
comes
back
and
says
we
understand,
we'll
deal
with
that
problem,
that
is
one
aspect
of
a
consultation
process
that
the
government
is
now
saying
we
should
never
have
to
go
through.
on
the
plants
however,
your
honor,
there
is
a
very
serious
concern.
in
this
respect
the
service
biologists
said
we
have
protected
these
plants'
habitats
through
the
section
7
mechanism.
the
state
of
arizona
acknowledges
that
it
has
no
law
or
regulation
which
forbids
the
destruction
of
federally
listed
plant
species.
section
9
of
the
endangered
species
act,
which
mr.
kneedler
brought
up
and
said
it
was
the
most
important
provision,
and
i
would
beg
to
differ.
i
think
sweet
home,
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
agree
that
section
7...
and
hill...
that
section
7
is
the
most
important
provision.
but
plant
species
are
not
protected
generally
by
section
9
of
the
endangered
species
act,
the
take
provision,
except
when
they're
on
federal
lands.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
service
biologists
were
saying,
and
this
is
how
i
read
the
record,
and
if
i
can
give
a
couple
more
citations,
page
128
and
139
of
the
joint
appendix.
on
one
plant
species,
joint
appendix
page
436.
on
the
water
on
both,
they
were
essentially
predicting
jeopardy,
unless
additional
protections
could
be
worked
out
in
this
process.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
with
regard
to
the
plant,
your
honor,
epa's
position
to
date
has
been
that
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
protect
that
plant
species
under
their
clean
water
act
authorities.
now
we
may
disagree
with
that,
but
that
is
the
position
they've
taken
so
far.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
under
their
clean
water
act
authority,
which
is
what
informs
their
oversight
activities.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
because
again,
what
the
consultation
process
is
designed
to
accomplish,
either
through
the
funding,
discretionary
decision
that
was
made,
other
mechanisms
that
can
come
into
play,
the
idea
behind
the
consultation
on
the
transfer...
and
i
think
this
is
critical
to
our
position...
is
to
say
if
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
protect
the
species
through
the
state
issuance
of
the
permits
and
the
other
authorities
we
have,
what
understanding
can
we
come
to,
consistent
with
our--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--other
obligations
to
protect
the
plant
species.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
what
the--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--well,
i
should
just
first
say
that
we
disagree
with
the
premise
of
that
question.
in
terms
of
epa's
position,
we
happen
to
think
that
epa
can
protect
those
kind
of
plant
species,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
additional
bases
s
for
a
remand.
but
i
think
the
more
important
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
biologist
said
in
this
administrative
record
that
the
loss
of
those
protections
was
an
indirect
effect
of
the
transfer,
that
because
we
have
used
these
protections
when
we've
issued
federal
permits
to
prevent
species
like
these
plant
species
from
going
extinction...
and
this
was
not
speculative--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
that's
an
awfully
good
question.
and
in
fact
we
believe
that
should
have
been
one
of
the
outcomes
of
the
consultations.
on
the
transfer.
if
one
of
the
results
of
the
transfer...
and
i
think
this
was...
i
think
what's
happening
is
that
the
government
has
basically
assumed
the
answer
to
the
consultation
before
we've
gotten
to
that
point.
they've
assumed--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--i
believe
that--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--it's
not
the
state's
obligation
to
consult,
your
honor.
just
to
be
clear,
section
67
imposes
no
obligation
on
the
state.
we
completely
agree
with
that.
it
imposes
an
obligation
on
a
federal
agency.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
we
don't
disagree
with
that
either,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
are
mechanisms
that
have
been
used
in
past
consultations,
especially
after
the
louisiana
decision
that
came
down,
which
involve
the
state
not
at
all,
which
involve
only
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
the
epa
recognizing
how
they
would
exercise
their--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that...
particularly
with
regard
to
texas,
florida,
oklahoma,
louisiana
and
other
states
that
have
gone
through
the
consultation
process,
we're
not
saying
that
anything
different
should
happen.
we're
saying
go
through
a
full
consultation
process,
agree
on
mechanisms
that
can
protect
these
species.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
again,
with
regard
to
consultation
with
arizona,
all
we're
asking
for
and
all
we've
ever
asked
for
in
this
case,
and
this
was
what
the
service
biologist
said,
was
use
the
consultation
process
to
agree
on
measures
that
can
be
put
in
place
post-transfer
that
will
prevent
the
species
from
going
extinct.
that's
what
happened--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--well,
the
narrowest
thing
we
need
is
simply
a
decision
that
the
government
changed
its
position
and
the
case
should
be
remanded.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
your
honor,
what
we
would
like
is
a
ruling
that
says
that
7(a)(2)
imposes
obligations
on
federal
agencies
just
like
the
clean
water
act
does,
that
the
agency
should
make
a
good
faith...
and
this
is
the
words
of
congress...
"a
good
faith
effort
to
use
the
consultation
process
provided
by
7(a)(2)
to
devise
mechanisms
to
protect
species.
"
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
they
would
put
those
mechanisms
in
legal
form
either
through
memorandum
of
agreement,
which
is
what's
been
used
in
the
past,
separate
agreements
between
epa
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--your
honor,
i
think
part
of
this,
these
agreements,
wouldn't
have
to
be
signed
by
the
state
at
all.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
think
it
is.
and
there
is
an
endangered
species
committee.
once
again--
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
--what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was...
i
think
if
in
the
end
of
the
day
you
look
at
all
of
these
opportunities
to
protect
species
and
you
say
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
and
the
state
refuses
to
cooperate,
you
have
what's
called
jeopardy
or
destruction
of
critical
habitat,
and
congress
said
that
the
mechanism
for
working
out
the
conflict
with
another
law
is
the
endangered
species
committee,
which
we
have
not
talked
about
very
much.
that
was
congress's
answer.
but
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was,
long
before
you
get
to
that
point
and
without
imposing
a
single
obligation
on
the
state,
simply
using
the
authority
under
402(d)
of
the
clean
water
act,
which
provides
for
this
oversight
opportunity,
the
service
and
the
epa
can
come
to
their
own
understanding
as
to
how
epa
will
in
fact
carry
out
its
post-transfer
review
of
these.
and
we
think
that
is,
that
is
an
acceptable
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
eric
r.
glitzenstein
thank
you.
