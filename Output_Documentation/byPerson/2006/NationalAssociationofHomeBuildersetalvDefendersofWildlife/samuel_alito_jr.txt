these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
under
the
federal
clean
water
act
(cwa)
the
state
may
apply
to
assume
responsibility
from
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency
for
the
issuant
of
permits
under
the
act’s
national
pollution
discharge
elimination
system
(npdes).
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act
provides
that
the
epa
“shall
approve”
a
state’s
application
for
the
transfer
of
permitting
authority
if
the
state
meets
nine
specified
statutory
criteria
relating
to
its
authority
under
state
law
to
administer
the
permit
program.
in
2002,
the
state
of
arizona
applied
for
a
transfer
permitting
authority
under
this
section.
the
epa
found
and
the
parties
to
this
case
do
not
dispute
that
arizona
met
each
of
the
nine
criteria
setout
in
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act
and
the
agency
approved
the
transfer
application.
respondent
defenders
of
wildlife
filed
the
petition
for
judicial
review
of
this
administrative
action
arguing
that
the
epa
failed
to
take
into
account
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
which
provides
the
federal
agencies
shall
in
consultation
with
the
secretary
of
commerce
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ensure
that
any
action
authorized,
funded
or
carried
out
by
such
agency
is
not
likely
to
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
any
endangered
species
or
threatened
species.
the
ninth
circuit
granted
petition
and
vacated
the
epa’s
transfer
decision
concluding
first
that
the
agency’s
action
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
it
was
based
on
legally
contradictory
positions
regarding
its
duties
under
the
endangered
species
act.
and
second
that
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
required
the
epa
to
consult
about
and
if
necessary
take
actions
to
prevent
any
harm
to
endangered
species
or
their
habitats
arising
from
the
transfer
of
permitting
authority
to
the
state.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision
and
we
now
reverse.
as
in
initial
matter
we
do
not
believe
that
epa’s
decision
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
the
ninth
circuits
holding
on
this
point
was
based
on
its
perceived
inconsistency
between
on
the
one
hand
the
epa’s
position
in
this
litigation
that
it
was
not
required
to
consult
under
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
and
on
the
other
hand
a
statement
in
the
agency’s
final
notice
of
action
suggesting
that
consultation
was
required.
but
this
statement
was
issued
after
the
agency
had
in
fact
conducted
consultations
about
the
impact
of
its
transfer
decisions
on
endangered
species
and
by
the
time
it
issued
its
final
notice
the
question
of
whether
these
consultations
were
required
or
simply
voluntary
was
moved.
even
if
there
was
a
error
in
the
epa
statement
that’s
error
was
harmless
because
at
the
time
it
was
made
it
could
not
possibly
have
effected
the
transfer
decision.
we
turn
now
to
the
substantive
statutory
question
presented
by
these
petitions.
does
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
which
contains
the
consultation
requirement
effectively
operate
as
tenth
criteria
that
the
state
must
satisfy
even
if
it
has
met
the
nine
statutory
criteria
for
transfer
setout
in
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act,
we
conclude
that
it
does
not.
section
402(b)
provides
that
the
epa
shall
approve
the
transfer
once
its
nine
specified
criteria
are
met.
this
language
is
mandatory
and
categorical.
but
section
7(a)(2)’s
language
is
similarly
categorical
that
provides
that
an
agency
“shall
consult”
in
an
effort
to
prevent
harm
to
identified
species.
as
respondents
read
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
it
would
operate
as
an
implied
repeal
of
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act
by
engrafting
a
tenth
condition
onto
section
402(b)’s
otherwise
exclusive
and
exhaustive
list
of
requirements.
our
case
law
is
clear
that
we
disfavor
implied
repeals
and
nothing
in
the
endangered
species
act
expresses
any
expressed
and
specific
intent
to
repeal
the
otherwise
mandatory
language
of
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act.
we
are
therefore
faced
with
two
mandatory
and
contradictory
statutory
commands
and
the
statutory
text
is
at
least
ambiguous
as
to
which
must
prevail.
given
this
ambiguity
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
how
the
expert
agencies
charge
with
administrating
the
statute
had
interpreted
them.
the
departments
of
commerce
and
the
interior
which
are
charged
with
administering
the
endangered
species
act
and
whose
interpretations
are
deference
have
reconcile
this
conflict
by
promulgating
the
regulation
providing
that
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
“applies
to
all
actions
in
which
there
is
discretionary
federal
involvement
or
control.”
as
interpreted
by
those
agencies
section
7(a)(2)
does
not
applied
agency
actions
that
are
not
discretionary
but
rather
are
mandated
by
some
other
statute.
this
interpretation
which
harmonizes
the
conflicting
commands
of
the
endangered
species
act
and
other
statutes
is
reasonable
and
entitled
to
deference.
given
in
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act
commends
a
mandatory
not
a
discretionary
agency
action
we
conclude
that
the
consultation
requirements
of
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
do
not
apply
to
it.
of
course
even
after
the
transfer
of
permitting
authority
to
arizona
the
epa
will
maintain
continuing
oversight
of
the
state
permitting
process.
respondents
argued
that
some
of
these
continuing
duties
for
example
the
epa’s
review
will
oversight
of
state
issue
permits
and
federal
funding
of
state
permitting
activities
are
themselves
discretionary
and
does
subject
to
the
endangered
species
acts
requirements
of
consultation
and
avoiding
of
harm
endangered
species.
this
maybe
so
but
the
question
is
not
presented
by
the
petitioner
before
us.
such
decisions
are
separate
from
the
transfer
of
permitting
authority
at
issue
today
and
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
the
viability
of
any
future
sue
challenging
such
decisions
under
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.

stevens
