justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
point
is
why
can't
it
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
the
esa
require
something
more
than
voluntary
cooperation?
i
mean,
you
quite
rightly
emphasize
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
approval
under
the
clean
water
act.
but
the
endangered
species
act
mandate
seems
equally
unconditional.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that
that's
your
point.
but
doesn't
that
sort
of
beg
the
question?
because
it's
not
that
anyone
is
suggesting
here,
i
think,
that
under
the
endangered
species
act
the
federal
government
can
keep
control
or
that
the
federal
government
can
in
effect
provide
guarantees
of
what
may
happen
in
response
to
some
future
development
proposal.
what
i
think
they're
arguing
is
that
when,
when,
when
the
agency
gives
the
approval,
it
should
require
that
there
be
some
kind
of
procedure
in
place
on
the
part
of
the
state
so
that
when
problems
arise
the
states
will
probably
respond
to
them
with
the
same
values
in
mind
that
the
feds
would.
and
the
question
is
why
cannot
the
endangered
species
act
be
enforced
in
that
way,
to
require,
in
effect,
an
advanced
mechanism
before,
in
effect,
the
whole
business
is
turned
over
to
the
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
you
say
you
don't
think
they
can
do
it.
but
the
problem
is
we've
got
two
statutes
each
of
which
is
mandatory.
and
your
response
seems
to
be,
well,
we'll
give
full
effect
to
one
and
we
will
ignore
the
other.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
is
a
tie
breaker.
and
why
do
you
not
have
an
obligation
to
do
what
you
can
with
respect
to
the
endangered
species
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
which
point
epa
doesn't
have
any
authority
left
under
the
clean
water
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
begs
the
question
because
the
concern
is
the
enforcement
of
the
endangered
species
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
they
get
that
in
the
memorandum
of
agreement
up
front?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
doesn't,
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
it's
in
the
agreement
up
front
the
odds
are
better
that
the
state
will
address
it,
as
opposed
to
the
state
ignoring
the
problem,
requiring
epa
then
to
take
affirmative
action
to
object?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
would
you
answer
my
question
first?
isn't
it
likely
that
the
states
are
going
to
respond
or
deal
with
the
problem
if
they
have
an
obligation
in
the
memorandum
of
agreement
right
up
front?
i
suppose.
but
let
me,
let
me,
let
me
explain
what
is
in
place.
epa's
regulations
require
that
a
state
furnish
its
draft
permits
to
the
public,
but
also
specifically
to
the
federal
wildlife
agencies.
that
gives
fish
and
wildlife
service
an
opportunity
to
comment
about
endangered
species
concerns
that
may
be
raised
by
the
draft
permit.
the
regulations
also
require
the
state
agency
to
take
into
account
the
comments
that
are
submitted
by
anyone,
including
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
noaa.
those
provisions
built
in
allow
the
federal
agencies
to
bring
their
concerns
to
the
state
agency,
and
i
think
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
state
agencies
will--
--is
there
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
agency
to
take
reasonable
action
in
response
to
them,
or
can
the
state
agency
simply
sit
there,
listen
with
a
tin
ear
and
then
do
whatever
it
wants
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the,
that
the,
that
the
enforcement
of
water
quality
standards
is,
in
effect,
the
indirect
answer
to
the
problem
that
the
other
side
raises?
that's
the
way--
it's
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
the...
the
later
act
is
the
endangered
species
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
that
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
can
just
as
well
say
that
if
it
does
not
control
then
there
is
an
exception
by
implication,
the
exception
being
based
on
the
prior
act.
neither
of
them
is
particularly
satisfactory,
but
neither
answer
gives
you
a
reason
to
ignore
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
by
that
very
reasoning
you
could
say
that
if
assurance
are
required
that
the
endangered
species
act
is
going
to
be
honored,
that
does
not
in
and
of
itself
prevent
any
development
program.
each,
in
effect,
is
a
kind
of
mechanism
for
dealing
with
something
that
may
happen
in
the
future.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
as
a
technical
matter,
don't
they
have
to
show
there's
no
jeopardy?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
to
follow
up
on
that?
a
few
minutes...
i
guess
your
time
is
getting
short
and
i'd
like
to
get
away
from
some
of
the
specifics
and
back
to
the
general.
a
minute
ago,
justice
breyer
in
effect
offered
you
an
opinion
and
he
spelled
it
out
and
he
said,
if
i
put
that
in
writing
is
that
what
you
want?
you
said,
well,
it's
really
more
than
we
need.
would
you
please
at
this
point
summarize
as
succinctly
as
you
can
what
you
need
to
win
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
tell
me
substantively,
what
do
you
want?
what
substantively
do
you
want
at
the
end
of
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
will
they
put
those
mechanisms
in
legal
form?
justice
david
h.
souter
justice
scalia's
got
a
fair
point.
what
if
the
states
say,
we
don't
want
a
memorandum
of
agreement?
what
does
the
federal
government
do
at
that
point?
doesn't
the
federal
government
at
that
point
say,
okay,
we're
not
going
to
issue
the
transfer
under
clean
water
because
we
have
an
independent
obligation
under
endangered
species
and
there's
got
to
be
both
or
there
will
be
neither?
isn't
that
the
federal
government's
position?
