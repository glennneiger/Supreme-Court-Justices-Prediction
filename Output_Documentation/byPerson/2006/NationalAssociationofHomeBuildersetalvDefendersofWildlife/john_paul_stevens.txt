how
long
has
that
been
the
government's...
the
epa
position?
how
long
has
that
been
the
epa's
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
that
always
been
the
epa's
position?
because
there's
an
allegation
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
you
changed
your
position
in
this
court,
to
change
the
position
you
took
even
in
the
lower
courts
at
issue.
is
that--
justice
john
paul

--but
your
position
was
they
didn't
have
to?
justice
john
paul

mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
memorandum
of
agreement?
that's
kind
of
a
new
concept
that
i
have
a
little
difficulty
following.
is
there...
is
that,
is
one
of
the
nine
conditions
of
approval
that
the
state
enter
into
a
memorandum
of
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
not
a
regulation
that
issues,
that
requires
the
states--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what's
the
statutory
authority
for
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if...
what
if
the
state
just
refused
to
enter
into
a
memorandum
of
agreement?
would
that,
could
that
be
a
ground
for
refusing
to
transfer
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
says
don't
want...
it
just
says
we
don't
want
to
enter
into
a
memorandum
of
agreement,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
require
the
making
of
a
memorandum
of
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
can
that
be
consistent
with
your
shall
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
changing
position?
have
you
agreed
and
conceded
that
the
nine
statutory
criteria
are
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
shift
back
and
forth
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
now?
are
they
or
are
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
in
your
discretion...
your
distinction
to
the
snail
darter
case
is
that
the
decision
to
built
the
dam
is
discretionary,
not
mandatory?
