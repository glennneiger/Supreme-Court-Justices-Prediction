justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
very
well
your
argument
that
if
the
epa
is
going
to
transfer
this,
they
transfer
it
to
arizona
and
the
first
thing
they
say
is,
we
look
at
arizona's
laws
and
they
protect
everything.
and
now
we
look
at
our
own
authority
and
if
they
get...
start
mucking
around
with
this,
we
can
refuse
the
permit.
and
besides
that,
we
have
a
memorandum
of
understanding
and
the
memorandum
of
understanding
or
whatever
it
is,
agreement
or
something,
is
going
to
be
they're
going
to
pay
as
much
attention
as
we
are.
so
they'll
pay
attention
to
this,
too,
and
if
they
don't
we
have
an
enforcement
mechanism.
so
no
problem;
we
are
not
putting
any
species
in
jeopardy.
we
satisfy
the
standard.
i've
got
that
part
of
the
argument.
i
think
i
paraphrased
it
pretty
well.
the
part
i
don't
get
is
then
you
say,
anyway,
we
don't
have
to
do
any
of
this
because
it
says
"shall
transfer",
therefore,
it's
not
discretionary,
it's
mandatory.
that
part
i
don't
get
because
there
are
nine
standards
there
and
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
is
rather
like
saying,
well,
the
icc
used
to
say
you
shall
let
the
railroad
build
a
spur,
provided
it's
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
i
mean,
are
you
suddenly
saying
every
statute
that
uses
the
word
esa?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my
problem
with
saying
it's
clear
is
that
they
have
nine
criteria.
one
of
the
criteria
is
you
look
to
five
other
statutes,
which
they
have
their
own
criteria
and
one
of
those
criteria
is
you
have
to
be
certain
that
the
state
will
assure
the
protection
and
propagation
of
a
balanced
population
of
shellfish,
fish,
and
wildlife.
and
by
the
time
you
get
through
those
nine
criteria,
i
don't
think
you'd
have
to
be
too
imaginative
a
lawyer
to
figure
out
ways
that
they
involve
everything
the
esa
involves.
so
if
there
ever
was
an
act
prefaced
by
the
word
esa
would
apply,
you
would
think
it
would
this
be
this
one,
which
has
to
do
with
water,
environmental
protection,
nine
criteria,
many
vague,
and
they
use
words
like
"wildlife",
"shellfish",
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
the...
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
with
justice
kennedy's
questions
and
your
answers
is,
is
there
really
an
issue
here?
and
i'm
beginning
to
see
maybe
there
is
an
issue
when
you
said
what
are
they
talking
about.
can
you...
it's
a
cactus.
they're
kidnapping
cactus,
as
apparently
happens.
and
if
in
fact
this
cactus,
if
the
thing
is
transferred
to
the
state,
that
cactus
is
going
to
disappear.
now
that
isn't
fish.
it
isn't
wildlife.
it
isn't
water.
it's
a
cactus.
so
can
you
take
that
into
account?
is
that
theoretical?
i
think
they're
trying
to
raise
this
question
of,
suppose
you
know
the
irs,
that
if
you
mail
a
refund
check
at
the
time,
the
person
who
gets
it
is
going
to
use
the
$500
to
destroy
the
last
salamander
in
the
world.
okay?
now
there
we
are,
endangered
species.
does
the
act
apply
to
the
irs?
i
would
have
thought
the
answer's
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
i
would
have
thought
the
same
reasoning
is
true
here,
but
what
the
act
tells
you
to
do
is
read
your
existing
authority,
but
read
it
in
light
of
informed
by
the
endangered
species
objectives
language,
et
cetera.
and
now
i
wonder
if
with
that
approach,
is
it
possible
that
even
the
cactus
could
fall
within
the
nine
criteria?
you're
not
going
to
depart
from
them
but
you're
going
to
read
them
generously
in
light
of
the
objective
of
the
endangered
species
act,
which
is
itself
an
environmental
objective.
now
how
does
that
work?
can
you
do
that?
you're
an
imaginative
lawyer.
can
you
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
answer
is
you
can.
then
are
you
satisfied
with
this
result
in
this
court?
one,
it
can
be
read
that
way.
they're
not
going
to
agree
with
that.
it
can
be
read
that
way,
and
therefore,
it
applies.
the
esa,
the
endangered--
two,
that
means
they
consult.
but
three,
the
result
of
the
consultation
here
which
has
been
done
means
there's
no
real
objection
to
the
transfer,
because
it's
virtually
inconceivable
given
the
weapon
that
the
epa
has,
withdrawing
permits,
given
a
memorandum
of
agreement,
given
the
possibility
of
supervision,
given
the
fact
that
the
wildlife
service
will
object,
writing
them
a
letter
or
a
phone
call
immediately,
given
all
that
stuff,
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
arizona
will
fail
to
protect
endangered
species.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
your
view
of
an
opinion
that
roughly
wrote
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
say
why
you
didn't
argue
it,
it's
exactly
that
point
i
sort
of
expected
you
might
agree
when
i
though
maybe
you
have
hooks
to
hang
the
nsa,
the
endangered
species
act
on.
but
it
was
the
other
half,
which
i
think
is
what
justice
stevens
is
saying
now.
i
read
through
this
record,
not
completely
but
pretty
well,
and
i
couldn't
find
a
single
thing
that
would
suggest
that
arizona
presents
any
risk
to
you.
and
so,
what
is
the
risk
to
an
endangered
species
that
you're
actually
worried
about
there?
and
you
rather...
i
didn't
think
you'd
like
to
agree
with
that,
but
i
want
to
press
you
to
find
out
what
actually
is
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
would
that
happen?
how
would
it
happen
that
they
would
get
rid
of
the
flycatcher
in
arizona,
considering
the
fact
that
they
have
laws
themselves
that
protect
endangered
species,
and
that's
a
bird,
and
a
bird
is
wildlife;
and
so
if
they
decide
they
want
to
kill
all
their
flycatchers,
which
i
would
doubt,
you
could
intervene
at
epa
and
stop
them.
so
how
is
that
actually
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
a
mandatory
decision?
no,
what's
a
discretionary
decision?
i
mean,
in
the
sense
you're
using
it.
i've
never
heard
of
an
agency
that
could
just
give
out
money
to
whoever
they
want,
like
you
or
me.
there
are
always
criteria.
write
a
"shall";
there
are
always
criteria.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
is
it
the
word
"unless",
because
here
we
have
nine
and
they're
broad.
probably
with
funding
we
have
32.
maybe
with
some
others
we
have
14.
but
i
can't
get
my
mind
around--
