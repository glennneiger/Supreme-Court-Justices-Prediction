isn't
there
a
difference
between
denying
the
application
because
the
endangered
species
act
hasn't
been
attended
to
adequately,
and
saying
you
meet
the
nine
criteria,
you're
going
to
get
your
application.
but
then,
so
it's
not
just
automatic
that
the
thing
becomes
the
state's
domain
rather
than
the
federal.
but
isn't
there
something
rather
detailed
called
a
memorandum
of
agreement
that's
worked
out,
and
couldn't
the
endangered
species
act
concerns
be
accommodated
that
way
instead
of
saying
one
statute
is
out
the
window,
even
though
epa
in
a
number
of
states
has
made
an
accommodation.
why
couldn't
the
endangered
species
act
concerns
be
reflected
in
that
memorandum
of
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
referring
to,
in
what
you
just
described
about
the
cooperation
among
the
federal
agencies,
to
what
has
been
called
in
their
brief,
it's
referred
to
as
a
coordination
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
agreement,
i
take
it
from
what
you
just
said,
is
in
full
force?
epa
hasn't
retreated
from
that
agreement
and
it
will
continue
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
mentioned
a
whole
string
of
states,
i
think,
texas,
florida,
maine
were
mentioned
as
states
that...
in
connection
with
the
transfer
of
the
permitting
authority
had
conditions
that
made
the
endangered
species
act
applicable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
was
done
in
texas,
florida
and
maine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that,
would
that
apply
in
this
case?
would
that
apply
to
arizona?
