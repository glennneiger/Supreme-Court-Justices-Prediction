except
to
the
extent
that
a
project
may
be
endangering
a
species,
not
by
reason
of
change
in
water
quality
but,
for
example,
by
destroying
habitat,
constructing
a
dam
or
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
would
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--270
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
260.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
that
be
read
just
to
apply
to
any,
any
state
permits
that...
that
violate
clean
water
requirements?
as
opposed
to
upland
habitat
which...
which
might
be
affected?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
you
feel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that
those
are
in
place.
as
i
understood
mr.
kneedler
to
say
that
that's
exactly
what
they,
what
they
continue
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
has
nothing
to
do,
as
the
chief
was
about
to
say
before
i
interrupted
him,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with,
with
whether
they
have
to
issue
the
npdes
authorization.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
get
back
to
the
memorandum
of
agreement
that
you've
called
our
attention
to
on
page
260?
i
read
that
paragraph,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
it
that
imposes
any
obligation
whatever
on
the
state.
it
is
just
a
description
of
what...
what
epa
is,
is
going
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
kind
of
consultation
with
fish
and
wildlife
that,
that
mr.
kneedler
described
to
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
talking
about
consultation
when
the
permit
is...
the
permit
application
is
issued.
not
consultation
at
the,
at
the
stage
of
approving
the
state
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
funding
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
the
government
fund
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
have
other...
let's
assume
that
i
disagree
with
you
on
whether
they
could
withhold
approval
of
the
npdes
transfer.
even
so,
i
think
you...
the
point
you're
making
now
is
that
apart
from
that
approval,
there
were
other
discretionary
actions
taken
here,
one
of
which
is
this
funding;
and
another
one
of
which,
i
believe,
is
whether...
never
mind
the
moas,
but...
i
have
it
written
down
here,
one
of
the
other
ones.
oh,
whether
existing
permits
would
be
transferred
to
state
authority
or
not.
and
that
is
apparently
discretionary
and
can
be...
what
do
we
do
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
not
enough.
why
wouldn't...
what
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
it
wouldn't...
that
the
same
would
not
happen
when
the
state
issued
the
permits?
i
mean,
you
have
to
show
some
reason
why
we
don't
trust
arizona
to
do
what
the
federal
government's
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
you
have
to
establish
jeopardy.
you
have
to
establish
jeopardy.
and
the
mere
fact
that
you're
giving
it
to
a
state
which
congress
has
been
willing
to
trust
with
implementing
this
law
is
not
enough
to
show
that
there's
jeopardy.
prima
facie,
we
would
expect
arizona
to
do
the
right
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that
answer.
the
chief
justice
is
asking,
if
epa
cannot
do
it
itself,
how
is
it
creating
any
jeopardy
in
transferring
the
authority
to
somebody
else
who
can't
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
assume
that
epa
can't
protect
these
plant
species
under
its
legislation,
what
harm
is
there
in
transferring
the
authority
to
somebody
else
who
can't
protect
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
coercing,
by
coercing
the
states
to
sign
those
agreements
on
pain
of
not
getting
npdes
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
they
do
then?
they
just
whistle
and
this
comes
forth?
states
don't
sign
stuff
just,
just
for
the
sake
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
your
position,
not
the
federal
government's
position.
it's
your
position
of
what
the
federal
government's
position
ought
to
be,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
hate
to
eat
up
any
of
your
rebuttal
time,
but
would
you
state
briefly
what...
how
you
would
treat
these
other
matters
that
were
resolved
by
the
agency
and
that
were
not
mandatory,
its
decision
to
transfer
prior
certificate
authority
to
the
states,
for
example,
and
the
other
instance
raised
by
opposing
counsel?
what
if
i
agree
with
you
on
whether
you
can
deny
the
npdes
permit,
but
i'm
concerned
about
these
other
actions
by
the
agency
that
were
discretionary?
justice
antonin
scalia
should
we
remand?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
mean
the
executive
can
ignore
earmarks?
