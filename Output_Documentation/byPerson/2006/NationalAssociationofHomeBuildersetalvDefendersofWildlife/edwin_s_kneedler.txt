mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
402(b)
of
the
clean
water
act
provides
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
shall
approve
an
application
by
a
state
to
administer
its
own
npdes
program
unless
epa
finds
that
the
state's
program
does
not
satisfy
nine
criteria
that
are
addressed
to
whether
the
state
has
the
legal
authority
under
state
law
to
carry
forward
with
the
program.
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
arizona's
program
satisfies
those
criteria.
the
ninth
circuit
nonetheless
set
aside
epa's
approval
of
arizona's
program.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
epa
could
not
approve
arizona's
application
unless
it
first
insured
that
there
would
be
in
place
under
arizona's
administration
protections
equivalent
to
those
that
would
be
applicable
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act
when
epa
itself
issues
permits.
that
holding
is
inconsistent
not
only
with
section
402(b)'s
mandatory
directive,
it's
also
inconsistent
with
section
7
of
the
esa
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that
is
our
position,
and
that
i
think
is
clear
from
section
402(b).
it
says
that
the
administrator
shall
approve
unless
he
finds
that
the
state
legal
authority
criteria
are
not
satisfied.
i
should
also
point
out
that
that's
reinforced
by
33
u.s.c.
1251(b),
which
expresses
a
strong
preference
for
state
protection
of
waters
and
in
particular
states
that
it's
the
policy
of
congress
that
the
states
administer
the
npdes
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
until
1993
when
the
vast
majority...
by
the
time...
by
that
time
the
vast
majority
of
transfers
or
approvals
had
already
taken
place.
there
had
never
been
consultation,
at
least
that
we're
aware
of
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act.
epa
did
consult
with
the
wildlife
agencies
on
six
programs
but
after
the
fifth
circuit...
from
then
until...
until
this
one,
but
after
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
the
american
forestry
case,
epa
never
tried
to
impose
any
obligations
on
a
state
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act.
what
it
did
is,
epa
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
worked
out
between
themselves
certain
arrangements
by
which
epa
would
look
at
endangered
species
considerations,
but
it
never
conditioned
the
approval
of
a
state
program
after
the
louisiana
program
struck
down
in
the
american
forestry
decision
in
1998,
on
the
states
having
in
place
certain
protections.
and
in
fact,
i
think
epa
would
not
characterize
what
it
did
even
in
the
louisiana
programs
as
the
sort
of
condition
that
the
fifth
circuit
understood.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i'm...
there
may
be
two
different
things
that,
referring
to
it.
section
7
imposes
an
obligation
on
federal
agencies
in
their
own
actions
not
to
jeopardize...
or
to
ensure
that
their
actions
are
not
likely
to
jeopardize
a
species.
ancillary
to
that,
there
is
an
obligation
on
federal
agencies
to
consult
with
the
fish
and
wildlife
agencies.
as
to
the
consultation
obligation,
as
i
mentioned,
epa
has
engaged
in
consultation
from
1993
until--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--our
position
now
is
that
it
did
not
have
to,
but...
and
more
fundamentally
our
position
is
that
because
the
transfer
or
the
approval
of
the
state
application
is
mandatory
if
these
nine
legal
authority
criteria
are
satisfied,
epa
could
not
withhold
approval
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--basically,
yes.
if
in
the
end
epa
could
not
disapprove
the
state's
application,
and
since
consultation
is
ancillary
to
the
substantive
obligation
not
to
jeopardize--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
memorandum,
the
memorandum
of
agreement,
is
called
for
under
epa's
regulations
as
really
a
procedural
mechanism
for
the
epa
and
the
state
agency
to
work
out
the
practicalities
of
the
state's
administering
the
program.
they
typically
address
such
things
as
how
the
state
agency
will
furnish
epa
draft
permits
and
that
sort
of
thing,
time
limitations
for
epa
to
look
at,
who
to
contact
at
the
state
agency.
it's
essentially
procedural
in
order
to
facilitate
epa's
continuing
oversight
role.
it's
not
a
vehicle
for
epa
to
impose
substantive
obligations
coming
from
other
statutes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
we
think
that
would
been
consistent
with
section
402(b),
which
requires,
which
requires
the
epa
to
approve
the
transfer.
now,
if
a
state
agency
chooses
to
cooperate
with
fish
and
wildlife
service
or
noaa
in
the
department
of
commerce
with
respect
to
species
under
its
jurisdiction,
that
is
all
fine.
and
i
should
point
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
unconditional
with
respect
in
our
view
to
actions
that
are
within
the
agency's
discretion
or
consequences
that
the
agency
will
cause.
but
more
fundamentally
in
response
to
your
question,
section
7
imposes
obligations
only
on
federal
agencies,
not
on
state
agencies.
like
402(b),
it
is
a
federalism-sensitive--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
to
the
latter,
we
don't
believe
that
epa
can
condition
the
transfer.
but
let
me
point
out
that
in
2001--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
endangered
species
act,
the
memorandum
of
agreement
that
was
entered
into
in
2001
between
epa
and
the
two
federal
wildlife
services
does
furnish
a
way
in
which
after
the
transfer
epa
can
take
into
account
endangered
species
considerations
within
the
scope
of
its--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that's
not
correct.
under
section
402(d)
epa
has
the
authority
to
object
to
a
state
permit.
and
if
the...
but
to
do
so
on,
based
on
a
determination
that
the
state
permit
would
not
satisfy
the
guidelines
and
requirements
of
the
clean
water
act.
so
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect
to
water
quality
issues
that
might
affect
an
endangered
species,
epa
takes
the
position...
and
i
think
it's
correct...
that
epa
can
object
to
a
state
permit
where
that
permit
would
not
comply
with
state
water
quality
standards
that
are
necessary
to
protect
the
endangered
species.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
epa
doesn't
need
the
state's
agreement
to
object
to
a
state
permit.
that
is
authority--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
further
mechanisms
that
are
in
place
under
epa
regulations
and
the
memorandum
of
agreement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
those
regulations
do
not
because
they
are
procedural.
then
what
happens
if
the
state
agency
does
not
respond
to
the
concerns
raised
or
does
not
remedy
the
concerns
raised
by
fish
and
wildlife
service
or
noaa,
epa
is
notified
and
epa
can
then
try
to
work
it
out
with
the
state
agency,
or,
failing
that,
epa
can
object
to
the
state
permit
if
it
does
not
satisfy
the
clean
water
act
standards.
and
again
with
respect
to
water
quality,
those
standards
are
set
at
a
level
that
is
necessary
to
protect
endangered
species.
so
as
far
as
water
quality
impacts
are
concerned,
epa
retains
complete
control
under
its
ability
to
object
to
the
permit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is.
epa--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--upland
habitat,
if
it's
water
habitat,
water
quality
standards.
epa
has
to
approve
state
water
quality
standards.
it
consults
with
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
noaa
in
doing
so
to
make
sure
endangered
species
would
be
protected
by
the
water
quality
standards.
and
then
each
individual
state
permit
is
measured
against
those
water
quality
standards
to
make
sure
they
comply.
so
therefore,
with
respect
to
water
quality,
fish
and
wildlife
service
agreed
that
the
mechanisms
i
have
just
described
would
take
care
of
any
endangered
species
act
concerns.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
the
2001,
february
22,
2001,
agreement
between
epa
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
correct.
and
some
of
the
things
i
described
were
embodied
in
epa
regulations
aside
from
the
agreement,
including
an
agreement
that
state
agencies
furnish
draft
permits
to
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
take
into
account
comments
that
are
received
in
return.
justice
scalia
is
correct
that,
that
the
impacts
that
would
not
be
covered
by
this
would
be
non-water
quality-related
impacts
on
upland
habitat.
but
in
our
view
that
simply
reflects
the
nature
of
the
clean
water
act
and
under
402(b)
it
is
a
clean
water
act.
it
deals
with
water
quality,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
epa
is
authorized
to
withhold
the
approval
or
condition
the
approval
of
a
transfer
of
permitting
authority
to
a
state
on
the
basis
of
what
the
state
will
do
with
respect
to
upland,
upland
habitat.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
essentially,
the
endangered
species...
there
was
a
subsequent
amendment
to
402(b),
but
for
these
purposes...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
it
is...
we
do
not
think
it
repeals...
it's
essentially
a
repeal
by
implication
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
beyond
that,
section
7
of
the
esa
is
a
generally
applicable
statute,
whereas
section
402(b)
speaks
specifically
and
comprehensively
to
the
question
of
federal
approval
of
state
programs.
we
also
think
this
would
be
a
particularly
unlikely
candidate
for
an
exception
to
that
because
epa's
approval
of
the
state
program
does
not
result
in
any
immediate
on-the-ground
consequences.
that
would
only
happen...
or
in-the-water
consequences.
that
would
only
happen
if
after
the
transfer
the
state
agency
actually
issued,
issued
a
permit.
so
what
we're
talking
about
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
point
i
was
making
earlier,
that
we
think
that
the
central
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
respondent's
position
here
is
that
epa
could
not
transfer
the
authority
unless
it
and
the
state
together
replicated
the
sort
of
protections
that
were
in
place
when
epa
itself
administered
the
endangered
species
act.
and
as
i
said,
that's
inconsistent
not
only
with
402(b),
but
with
congress's
federalism-sensitive
judgment,
to
impose
the
sort
of
substantive
and
procedural
administrative
requirements
in
section
7
of
the
esa
only
on
federal
agencies,
not
on
state
agencies.
and
let
me
also
stress
that
this
does
not
mean
that
the
rest
of
the
esa
is
inapplicable
once
a
permitting
program
of
the
state
is
approved.
the
central
provision
of
the
esa,
the
prohibition
against
taking
endangered
species
act
and
other
provisions
against
trading
in
them
and
importing,
exporting,
all
those
remain
applicable.
those
are
the
generally
applicable
provisions
that
prohibit
the
taking
of
endangered
species.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it
would
require
a
statute
by
statute
evaluation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
we
think
this
one
is
particularly
clear.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several,
several
responses
to
that.
those
cross-references...
first
of
all,
402(b)
looks
only
to
whether
the
state
has
the
legal
report
under
state
it
law.
among
other
things,
it
requires
a
certification
or
determination
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
to
establish
that
the
state
actually
has
the
authority
to
administer.
and
the
references
to,
cross-references
to
fish
and
wildlife
that
come
from
incorporating
other
provisions
have
to
do
with
the
setting
of
the
standards
or
setting...
under
section
302,
which
epa
has
never
invoked,
setting
certain
supplementary
effluent
standards
to
protect
fish
and
wildlife.
those
are
the
standards.
epa
does
not
evaluate
the
state's
water
quality
standards
in
deciding
whether
the
state
has
the
legal
authority
under
402(b)
to
administer
the
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was,
there
was
in
the
louisiana
memorandum
of
agreement
that
was
involved
in
the
fifth
circuit's
american
forestry
decision,
and
it
was
that
provision
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
was
unlawful
on
two
grounds.
that,
that
memorandum
of
agreement
basically
said
we're
trying
to
do
something
analogous
to
section
7
of
the
esa
when
the
state
is
administering
the
program;
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
went
beyond
epa's
authority
by
conditioning
the
approval
on
the
state
putting
in
place
a
compensation
arrangement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
not
correct,
justice...
justice
ginsburg.
what,
after
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
epa
never
tried
to
impose
on
a
state
an
obligation
to
go
forward
in
the
same
way
that
epa,
or
even
in
a
similar
way
that
epa
would
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
all
provided
what
i've
described
to
justice
souter,
that...
that
the
pre-existing
esa,
epa
regulations
require
that
draft
permits
be
furnished
to
the,
to
fish
and
wildlife
and
to
noaa,
and
that
they
take
into
account
the
comments
by
fish
and
wildlife
and
noaa.
that
doesn't
come
from
the
memorandum
of
agreement
or...
or...
or
epa's
memorandum
of
agreement
with
the
states.
that's
something
that
comes
from
the
regulations.
everything
else--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and,
and
the
biological,
the
memorandum
of
agreement
in
this
case
applies
to
all
state-administered
programs
including
those
that
were
approved
by
epa
before
1993.
this
is
a
nationwide
memorandum
of
agreement.
and
the
basis--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
is...
no
it
is
not.
the
memorandum
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
there,
there's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--33
u.s.c.
1314(i)
allows...
provides...
excuse
me...
for
epa
to
establish
guidelines,
basic
guidelines,
minimum
standards
for
state
programs
and...
part
of
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if,
if
the,
if
its
refusal
was
based
on
an
objection
to
things
that
are
within
the,
within
the
legitimate
scope
of
a
memorandum
of
agreement.
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yeah.
i...
i
think...
i
don't
think
epa
has
ever
confronted
that.
but
i
think
it
probably,
it
probably
could
be
denied,
but
the
regulations
do
not...
as
i
recall...
specifically
condition
the
approval
of
the
program
on
the
memorandum
of
agreement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
would,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that
epa
could
not...
could
not
insist
on
that,
but
it's
important
again
to
come
back
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
there's
a
separate
authority
for
the,
for
the,
for
epa
to
issue
guidelines
for
minimum,
minimum
standards
for
state
programs,
but
those
have
to
do
with...
with
communications
with
epa
and
sort
of
running
a
program.
and
it's
not
a
vehicle
as
i
said
before
for
epa
to
impose
new
substantive
requirements
outside
the
clean
water
act
on
the
state.
and
that's
why
if...
that's
why
if
epa
insisted
that
a
state
enter
into
a
memorandum
of
understanding
that
basically
said
we
will,
we
will
act
like
epa
does
under
section
7
of
the
endangered
species
act
under
the
administration
of
the
program,
i
think
the,
i
think
the
state
agency
would
be
entitled
to
decline
to
enter
into
that
agreement.
and
again
that's
essentially
what
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
the
american
forestry
case,
and
to
what
extent
we
agree
with
the
american
forestry
decision.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice:
first,
with
respect,
stepping
back
and
looking
at
the
legal
theory,
we
think
that
this
case
is
really
on
all
fours
with
the
public
citizen
case.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
operative
regulation
here,
the
definition
of
"indirect
effect",
meaning
something
caused
by
the
agency,
is
just
like
the
one
in
public
citizen.
in
public
citizen
this
court
held
that
where
an
agency
has
a
mandatory
duty
and
does
not
have
the
ability
to
control
subsequent
events,
that
the
agency
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
legal
cause
of
whatever
effects
happen.
that
is
exactly
the
case
here.
section
402(b)
mandates
that
epa
approve
the
state's
application.
epa
therefore,
epa's
decision
therefore
is
not
the
legal
cause
of
any
effects
that
might
happen
with
respect
to
endangered
species.
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
court's
decision
in
sweet
home
this
court
in
footnotes
9
and
13
read
the
other
principal
provision
of
the
esa,
the
take
provision,
to
incorporation
a
proximate
cause
limitation.
we
think
it
follows
that
the
jeopardize
prohibition
in
section
7
also
incorporates
a
proximate
cause
or
here
legal
cause
restriction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
that,
so
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
give
a
definitive
answer.
but
i
believe
to
the
extent
it
would
be
discretionary
that
section
7
may
well
kick
in.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because
there
was
no
challenge
to
that.
there
was
no
challenge
to
that
aspect
of
it.
this
was
a
challenge
to
the
transfer
of
authority,
not
ancillary
matters
addressed
under
the
agreement.
also,
footnote
18
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
makes
clear
that
respondents
did
not
challenge
anything
to
do
with
funding,
which
is
an
entirely
separate
administrative
determination
that
there's
a
regulatory
set
of
criteria
for
how
funding
gets
distributed,
it
is
not
dependent
on
whether
the
state
has
npdes
authority.
section
106
of
the
clean
water
act
has
a
separate
funding
mechanism
for
clean
water
act
authority
generally.
so
funding
is
simply
not,
it's
simply
not
in
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
in
fact
this
court's
decision
in
hill
can't
be
understood
in
any
other
day
because
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that,
while
congress
committee
reports
indicated,
for
the
appropriations
bills,
indicated
an
expectation
that
the
dam
would
be
built,
the
court
emphasized
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mandate
in
the
appropriations
statute
itself.
that
would
have
been--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
that
part
of
the
court's
decision
would
have
been
unnecessary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
there
are
few
statutes
like
this,
that
say
the
agency
shall
unless
certain
things
happen.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
may
be
particular
applications
of
the
standard,
but
that
did
not
deter
this
court
in
public
citizen,
where
the
court
applied
the
same
principle
and
said
where
the
agency
has
a
mandatory
duty
and
no
discretion
it
is
not
the
legal
cause.
that's
the
general
principle.
if
there
are
other
cases
where
that
general
principle
has
to
be
applied,
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
consideration
to
arise.
another
important
aspect
of
hill
is
this
court
quoted
representative
dingell,
the
sponsor
of
it,
saying
that
agencies
are
to
take
actions
within
their
power,
which
suggest
that...
and
we
think
it's
clear
through
the
history,
as
we
recite
in
our
brief
at
pages
27
and
28,
from
the
text
of
the
act
and
from
the
evolution
of
section
7,
it
was
always
understood
to
apply
to
situations
where
the
agencies
had
the
existing
authority
to
take
action,
not
to
require
them
to
countermand
statutory
directives
the
way
the
department
of
transportation
could
not
countermand
statutory
directives
in
public
citizen.
thank
you.
