ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
this
court
has
laid
out
a
framework
for
reviewing
prosecutors'
closing
arguments,
the
fairness
standard
established
in
donnelly
and
darden
is
by
its
nature
a
very
general
standard.
under
this
court's
interpretation
of
aedpa,
the
state
court
should
therefore
be
provided
more
leeway
in
reaching
outcomes.
nevertheless,
the
eighth
circuit
afforded
no
deference
to
the
missouri
supreme
court's
decision.
instead,
its
improperly
substituted
its
own
evaluation
for
the
comments,
looking
at
each
of
them
in
isolation
and
without
considering
the
totality
of
the
proceedings.
that
decision
was
wrong
not
only
because
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
properly
afford
deference
to
the
state
court,
but
because
when
viewed
within
the
entire
proceedings
the
prosecutor's
closing
arguments
did
not
deprive
the
respondent
of
a
fair
trial.
applying
aedpa
correctly,
the
missouri
supreme
court
decision
was
well
within
reason
given,
one,
the
nonspecific
standard
of
fundamental
fairness
and
the
fact
that
this
court
has
never
applied
that
standard
to
a
penalty
phase
closing
argument;
and,
two,
because,
considering
the
record
in
the
entire
proceedings
of
this
case,
the
respondent
was
not
deprived
of
fundamental
fairness.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it's
certainly
is
not
our
argument
that
it
would
not
apply
to
the
penalty
phase.
however,
there
simply
may
be
other
considerations,
because
the
fundamental
fairness
standard
essentially
answers
the
question,
did
the
jury
base
their
verdict
on
the
evidence
or
did
they
base
it
improperly
on
the
prosecutor's
comments.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
think
it
certainly
could
be.
in
brown
versus
payton
there
was
certainly
a
concern
about
the--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
to
help
answer
the
question,
though,
in
that
context,
donnelly
and
darden
set
down
some
general
considerations
that,
while
not
exclusive,
help
provide
the
post
and
beams
of
the
fundamental
fairness
standard.
so
even
assuming
that
all
of
the
statements
were
improper,
those
considerations
when
applied
to
this
case
show
that
the
trial
was
not
rendered
unfair
because
of
the
prosecutor's
argument.
first,
none
of
the
comments
misstated
the
evidence
nor
did
they
misstate
the
law.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
the
assumption
is
that
under
the
first
tier
in
donnelly
and
darden
that
the
statements
were
improper
in
the
sense
that
within
the
context
of
the
multi-factor
kind
of
considerations,
whether
or
not
they
were
improper,
because
obviously--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--it
could
be
improper
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
misstatement
of
evidence.
i
don't
know
that
impropriety
would
include
necessarily
emotional
appeal.
i
mean,
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
trial
devoid
of
emotion.
however,
impropriety
under
donnelly
and
darden
was
the
first
tier
of
the
multi-tier
kind
of
fundamental
fairness
test.
so
even
assuming
that
that
first
tier,
that
the
statements
were
improper,
they
still
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
fundamental
unfairness.
secondly,
none
of
the
individual
comments
implicated
the
defendant's
rights
under
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment,
nor
were
they
of
the
very
specific
kind
of
comments
that
this
court
has
found
to
violate
the
eighth
amendment
under
caldwell.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor.
i
would
disagree.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
would
not...
it
was
not
particularly
relevant.
it
was
probably
an
inartful
attempt
to
imply
or
tell
the
jury
that
it
was
a
difficult
decision
that
they
had
ahead
of
them,
one
that
they
might--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--yes,
a
duty
to
return
the
death
penalty,
which
certainly
is
a
misstatement
of
the
law.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
those
statements
could
be
that
the
duty
was
to
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
it's
certainly
not
improper
to
make
statements
based
on
inferences
from
the
evidence.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor.
it
certainly
was
not
a
statement
on
the
evidence
in
sense
of
was
it
a
discussion
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
however,
based
on
the
totality
of
the
entire
proceedings,
it's
clear
that
that
statement
did
not
render
the
entire
trial
unfair
because--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--and
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
i
would
certainly
agree
that
those
arguments
based
on
the
strength
of
the
case
were
not
necessarily--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--well,
in
the
sense
that
viereck
was
not
directly--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
think
the
concession
is
important
to
get
beyond
the
statements
in
isolation,
because--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--yes.
however,
the
jury
was
also
told
that
it
was
their
discretion
to
spare
his
life
at
appendix
275.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
in
newlon,
your
honor,
it
was
a
due
process
case
which
the
same
prosecutor
tried,
and
it
was
an
eighth
circuit
case.
and
in
that--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
to
the
extent
that
newlon
sets
out
those
arguments,
no,
that's
not
incorrect.
those
arguments
were
made
in
newlon.
however,
for
two
reasons
newlon
is
distinguishable.
in
this
case
there
were
curative
instructions
given
to
the
jury.
in
newlon
there
were
no
objections
made.
so
in
this
case,
when
the
prosecutor
made
the
statement,
for
example,
that,
i'm
the
top
law
enforcement
officer,
there
was
an
objection
and
there
was
a
curative
instruction.
so
it
was
not--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--there
was
not
an
objection...
there
was
an
objection
to
the
patton,
but
it
was
overruled.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
there
was
not.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
there
is
none,
your
honor.
and
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
comment
is
that
he
was
imparting
to
the
jury
the
duty
to
make
the
decision,
not
necessarily
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
well,
i
would
distinguish
viereck
on
two
grounds.
one,
it
was
not
directly
a
due
process
case
as
this
case
is
raised,
because
it
was
raised
under
this
court's
supervisory
powers.
secondly,
in
this
case
there
was...
out
of
the
eight
separate
comments
that
the
eighth
circuit
found
improper,
only
three
of
them
were
actually
objected
to,
two
of
which
were
sustained
and
curative
instructions
were
given.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
in
newlon
the
jury
was
never
told
to
disregard
the
statements.
in
our
case
the
jury
was
told
to
disregard
the
statements.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
correct.
there
were
12
objections
made
total.
interestingly,
though,
the
defense
attorney
did
not
raise
objections
to
the
majority
of
the
comments
that
the
eighth
circuit
found
improper.
now,
while
that's
not
dispositive,
i
think
that
the
defense
attorney
is
certainly
in
the
best
position
to
judge
whether
or
not
a
comment
prejudices
his
client.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no
objections
at
all.
there
were
no
objections
at
all.
in
our
case
there
were
12
objections,
so
clearly
the
defense
attorney
was
on
the
mark
and
was
listening
for
prejudicial
comments
from
the
prosecutor.
of
the
eight
comments
that
the
eighth
circuit
found
objectionable
in
this
case,
only
three
of
them
were
objected
to.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
so
assuming
that
the
defense
attorney
was...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
correct.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
would
actually...
if
you
compare
the
three
arguments
side
by
side,
the
prosecutor's
statements
were
tempered
in
this
case.
the
decision...
when
he
tried
this
case,
it
was
approximately
five
weeks
after
the
district
court
in
newlon
had
come
down
with
the
decision.
and
there
are
statements
that
he
made
in
newlon
and
shurn
that
were
not
in
this
case.
for
example,
in
newlon
he
said
this
is
the
worst
case
ever
and
in
shurn
he
said
the
same
thing.
he
did
he
not
say
that
in
this
case.
so
i
think
from...
if
you
do
a
side
by
side
comparison,
his
statements
were
actually
tempered.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
agree.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
clearly,
it's
not
established
law
by
this
court,
and
this
court
has
not
specifically
outlined
the
kind
of
post
and
beam
that
would
result
in
a
reversal
in
a
penalty
phase
closing
argument.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
correct,
yes.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
is
it
the
same,
the
same
arguments
in
the--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that.
but
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
there
may
be
other
considerations
that
apply
in
the
penalty
phase
that
don't
necessarily
apply
in
the
guilt
phase.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no.
and
this
is
why.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
no.
because
of
the
very
specific
nature
of
the
supervisory
powers
in
those
cases,
i
don't
believe
that
in
the
larger
context,
the
final
standards,
that
we
can
say
that
those
directly
apply.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
certainly,
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
also
no
mechanism
in
this
case
for
the
jury
to
apply
any
of
the
improper
remarks
to
their
deliberations
because
they
were
properly
instructed.
instructions
which
we
presume
that
they
followed.
in
this
case,
the
court
read
the
instructions
to
the
jury
before
closing
arguments,
and
a
copy
was
also
given
to
the
jury
to
deliberate
with.
four
of
those
instructions,
numbers
21,
28,
26,
and
27,
told
the
jury
in
various
forms
that
it
was
their
duty,
and
theirs
alone,
to
render
a
verdict.
the
jury
was
also
told
in
instructions
23,
24,
and
26
that
it
was...
that
their
decision
must
be
within
the
confines
of
the
evidence.
and
thirdly,
within
the
specific
process
laid
out
for
finding
ways...
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstances.
and
finally,
the
last
instruction
that
the
jury
heard
before
closing
arguments
was
that
closing
arguments
were
not
evidence.
it
is
counterintuitive
to
assume
that
the
jury
disregarded
those
instructions
as
a
whole
and
instead
improperly
relied
on
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
when
they
declined
to
find
the
one
aggravating
circumstance
that
the
prosecutor
spoke
most
about.
at
appendix
285
is
the
part
of
the
closing
argument
where
the
prosecutor
discussed
the
aggravating
circumstances.
he
argued
to
the
jury
that
all
four
applied,
but
spent
most
time
speaking
about
number
one,
which
was
that
he
had
killed
for
money.
however,
the
jury
did
not
find
aggravator
number
1.
so
the
very
aggravator
that
the
prosecutor
argued
most
about
to
the
jury,
they
did
not
find.
it's
more
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
jury
made
its
decision
based
on
the
strength
of
the
evidence
and
the
strong
evidence
in
support
of
the
death
penalty.
having
rejected
the
misidentification
defense,
the
jury
necessarily
found
that
the
respondent
was
the
passenger
who
had
returned
to
the
woods
to
shoot
the
victim
several
more
times.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
there
was
a
habeas
petition
filed
prior
to
aedpa,
but
it
was
dismissed
and
he
did
not
appeal
from
that.
this
was
filed
after
aedpa.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
however,
your
honor,
he
did
not
appeal
from
that.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
yes,
he
did.
however,
he
did
not
appeal--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--however,
the
parties
have...
the
respondent
has
not
asserted
that
argument,
that
aedpa
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
and
for
good
reason,
because--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
finally,
given
the
overwhelming
evidence...
it
supported
a
finding
that
the
respondent
had
carried
out
an
execution
style
murder
for
the
purpose
of
silencing
a
witness.
i'll
preserve--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--not
directly,
your
honor.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
i
think
certainly
this
court
can
use--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--certainly
not
ignored,
your
honor.
but
in
the
context
of
fundamental
fairness,
as
to
whether
or
not
that
case
applies,
i
would
argue
that
it
does
not
directly
apply.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
not
necessarily
not
applicable
to
state
prosecutors.
however,
in
the
context
of
fundamental
fairness,
does
it
establish
a
clear...
a
rule
in
the
sense
of
those
kinds
of
statements
will
render
a
trial
fundamentally--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--certainly,
it
is
something
that
state
prosecutors
should
follow
in
the
sense
of
what
they
should
say
and
what
they
should
not
say.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
under
the...
it
is
not
the
law
in
the
sense
of
fundamental
fairness.
it
is
certainly
an
indication
of
what--
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
well,
i
would
argue
that
in
those
cases,
it
is
a
supervisory
power
case.
and
so
to
that
extent,
it's
not
applicable
to
this
particular--
case.
i'll
reserve.
ms.
andrea
k.
spillars
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
address
two
points.
first,
it
is
not
clearly
established
that
deterrence
arguments
in
closing
arguments
are
improper,
and
for
good
reason,
particularly
because
of
the
strength
of
this...
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
killed
a
federal
witness
execution-style.
to
that
extent,
as
i
understand
the
respondent's
argument,
the
deterrence
rises
or
falls
on
however
the
prosecutor
has
prefaced
his
deterrence
argument,
if
he
says
certain
words
to
mitigate
the
deterrence
argument.
however,
trials
don't
operate
in
terms
of
specific
words
that
must
be
pre-spoken
before
an
argument
can
be
valid.
secondly,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
previously,
i
would
advise
that
prosecutors
should
not
use
some
arguments,
not
necessarily
the
deterrence
argument,
but
not
that
in
every
instance
they
must
not
use
those
arguments.
this
court's
supervisory
role
in
those
kinds
of
cases
allows
this
court
to
turn
should's
into
must's
for
federal
prosecutors,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
second...
thirdly,
the
viereck
case
is
in
a
historical
context
which
we
don't
have
here,
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
consider
the
penalty
phase
arguments.
at
page
237
of
the
appendix
the
court
specifically
said:
"we
have
reviewed
the
penalty
phase
arguments.
"
and
then
at
page
235,
the
missouri
supreme
court
distinguishes
newlon
and
says
that
they
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
statements
made
in
newlon.
so
to
that
extent
the
missouri
state
court
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
precedents
and
deference
should
afforded
to
that
state
court
decision.
for
that
reason
we
would
ask
that
this
case
be
reversed.
thank
you.
