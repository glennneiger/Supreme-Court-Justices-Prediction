justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
overstated
the
significance
of
viereck.
isn't
viereck...
does
viereck
stand,
do
you
think,
for
a
per
se
rule
that
a
prosecutor
in
a
closing
argument
may
never
mention
the
word
soldier?
isn't
that
a
much
more
limited...
much
more
limited
holding?
this
was
a
prosecution
during
world
war
ii
of
individuals
for
failing
to
register
as
agents
of
nazi
germany,
and
the
prosecutor
said
in
the
guilt
phase...
and
it
wasn't
a
capital
case
obviously,
in
the
guilt
phase
of
closing
argument,
that
just
as
our
soldiers
who
are
fighting
the
japanese
on
the
bataan
peninsula
are
doing
their
duty
for
the
country,
you
have
a
duty
to
return
a
guilty
verdict
against
these
individuals.
now,
isn't
that
very
different
from
saying
that
in
a
capital...
at
the
capital
phase
of
the
trial,
you
have
a
duty
to
consider
something
that's
very
unpleasant,
and
it's
unpleasant
in
the
same
way
that
what
soldiers
have
to
do
in
war
time
is
different?
isn't
that
very
different?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
that
improper?
is
it
improper
at
the
penalty
phase
for
a
prosecutor
to
refer
to
the
concept
of
deterrence,
which
by
definition
is
bigger
than
the
individual
whose
sentence
is
being
considered?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
moral
culpability
is
the
only
factor
that
can
be
mentioned?
i
thought
you
said
earlier
it
was
okay
for
the
prosecutor
to
refer
to
deterrence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
a
prosecutor
say
that
killing
a
witness
is
something
that
needs
to
be
deterred
and
therefore
it's
important,
it's
appropriate
to
impose
the
death
penalty
here
in
order
to
send
a
message
of
deterrence?
is
that
improper?
