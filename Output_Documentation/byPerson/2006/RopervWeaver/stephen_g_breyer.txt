justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is...
i
agree
with
you,
i
agree
with
you
that
we
should
look
at
the
whole
picture.
when
i
look
at
the
whole
picture...
i've
actually
got
a
little
chart
that
my
law
clerk
prepared.
and
what
he
did,
he
went
through
this
and
looked
at
a
case
called
newlon
and
it
was
the
same
prosecutor.
and
the
prosecutor
was
told
in
that
case
just
what
he
shouldn't
do.
and
now
if
we
look
what
he
did
in
this
case
and
look
what
he
did
in
that
case
and
look
at
the
law,
the
whole
thing,
not
just
little
bits,
it
looks
like
he
did
an
awful
lot
of
what
he
wasn't
supposed
to
do.
you're
not
supposed
to
give
an
argument
that
vouches
as
the
u.s.
attorney
that
i
think
that
this
is
what
you
should
do.
so
in
newlon
he
says:
i'm
talking
to
you
as
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
county,
the
top
law
enforcement
officer.
and
here
he
says:
i'm
the
top
law
enforcement
officer
and
i
decide
in
which
cases
we
have
the
death
penalty
and
not.
worse
than
newlon,
i
would
say.
then
what
you're
not
supposed
to
do
is
you're
not
supposed
to
tell
them
they're
like
soldiers.
i
mean,
there's
supreme
court
cases
that
say,
don't
tell
them
you're
like
a
soldier
doing
duty.
at
least
that's
what
all
these
prosecutors...
a
case
called
byron
versus
the
united
states.
so
in
newlon
what
he
says
is:
i
want
to
impress
on
you,
this
is
a
war
and
it's
justifiable
to
kill
in
war.
here
he
says:
as
in
the
movie
"patton"
and
in
the
movie
george
patton
is
talking
to
his
troops
because
they're
going
out
in
battle
like
the
soldiers.
and
then
he
says:
and
when
you're
a
soldier,
you
know
what
to
do
when
you
put
your
hand
in
a
pile
of
goo
that
a
moment
before
was
your
best
friend's
face;
you'll
know
what
to
do;
and
last
july
this
defendant's
face
was
a
pile
of
goo.
okay,
there
we
are.
i
mean,
that
sounds
pretty
emotional.
it
sounds
like
a
soldier
does
his
duty
and
you're
doing
it.
and
then
another
thing
you're
not
supposed
to
do
is
you're
not
supposed
to
tell
them
it's
their
duty
to
the
community.
and
this
is
just
filled
with
instances
where
you
hardly
even
know
that
there's
a
person
called
weaver
because
he
says:
what
you
have
to
do
here
is
send
a
message
to
the
drug
lords,
send
a
message--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
there's
a
brief--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not?
why
did
they
file...
is
this
brief
wrong,
then,
the
brief
of
the
former
prosecutors
giving
the
propositions
that
i
just
stated
and
have
the
supreme
court
case
next
to
each
one?
are
they
wrong,
those
prosecutors?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
with
the
patton
and
the
goo?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
a
curative
instruction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
viereck
the
words
were:
"this
is
war,
harsh,
cruel,
murderous
war.
"
and
the
prosecutor
went
on
to
analogize
the
jury's
duties
to
the
duties
of
soldiers
and
he
said:
do
your
duty.
do
you
think
that's
a
lot
different
than
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
those
things
that
are
improper
for
a
prosecutor
to
make
in
summing
up
in
the
guilt
phase,
are
they
then
proper
to
say,
exactly
those
things,
in
a
sentencing
phase
with
capital...
with...
you
know,
capital
sentencing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
number
of
cases--
in
this
court
that
say
what
a
prosecutor
can't
say,
guilt
phase.
all
of
them
happen
to
be
guilt
phase,
i
guess.
you
can't,
you
know,
vouch.
you
can't
use
too
much
emotion.
you
have
to
focus
on
what
the
defendant
did,
not
on
what
somebody
else
did.
i
mean,
there
are
a
number
of
things.
now,
do
those...
is
it
fair
or
not
fair
to
say
that
those
precedents
apply
in
the
capital
sentencing
phase,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you,
where...
one
of
the
passages
that
i
thought
went
a
little
far
where
is
he
says
to
the
jury,
the
one
thing
you've
have
got
to
into
your
head;
this
is
far
more
important
than
william
weaver.
this
case
goes
far
beyond
william
weaver.
this
touches
all
the
dope
peddlers
and
the
murderers
in
the
world.
that's
the
message
you
have
to
send.
it
just
doesn't
pertain
to
william
weaver.
it
pertains
to
all
of
us,
the
community.
the
message...
there
are
street,
et
cetera.
okay.
now.
that
struck
me,
as
you
argue
this
is
rather
extreme.
its
seems
to
be
removing
the
attention
of
the
jury
from
william
weaver
and
saying
you
have
a
duty
to
send
this
man
for
other
reasons.
now...
to
execute
him.
but
where
do
i
find
in
the
u.s.
reports
the
case
or
statement
that
then
says
this
is
the
kind
of
argument
the
prosecutor
cannot
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
talking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
that
you
said
explicitly,
the
prosecutor...
which
he
didn't
say...
but
you're
arguing
basically,
it
is
a
fair,
sort
of
an
implication,
suppose
he
said
there
are
a
lot
of
drug
dealers
around,
and
he's
one
of
them.
and
this
sentencing
phase
isn't
about
just...
just
isn't
about
william
weaver.
it
is
about
sending
a
message
to
the
others.
and
if
you
execute
him,
even
if
you
think
he
shouldn't
be
executed,
you
don't
think
he
ever
should
be,
but,
you
see,
others
will
think
that
this
is
a
message.
so
do
it
just
to
give
a
message.
even
if
you
think
he
never
did
it.
no
matter
what
you
think
of
him,
you
think
he's
the
best
person
in
the
world.
still
execute
him
just
to
send
a
message.
now
would
that
violate
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
of
course.
what
case
in
the
supreme
court
would
you
look
to
to
show
it
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
find
any
one
where
anybody
ever
had
an
argument
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
so
you
are
saying
we
should
look
not
just
to...
if
we
try
to
look
for
exact,
identical
arguments
maybe
we'll
get
into
that
problem?
of
having
to
uphold
things
we
all
know...
or
is
that
right?
or
what?
