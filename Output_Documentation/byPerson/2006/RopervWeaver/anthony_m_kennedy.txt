justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
on
your
assumption,
to
make
your
hypothetical
clear,
you,
you
want
us
to
assume
that
three
or
four
times
at
least
he
violated
a
constitutional
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
know
what
arguendo
assumption
you
are
making.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
they'd
be
improper
because
they...
they
were
based
on
an
emotional
appeal
that's
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
passage
was
in
the
context
of
other
statements
in
which
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
analogized
the
role
of
the
juror
to
the
role
of
a
soldier
who
has
to
have
the
courage
and
the
duty
to
kill.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
us...
as
you
know,
aedpa
has
the
decisions
of
settled
precedents
of
the
supreme
court
and
there's
the
supreme
court
standard,
a
very
general
standard
that
we
can
get
from
darden
and
donnelly,
although
we
didn't
reverse
there.
i
take
it
that
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
is
going
to
say:
well,
this
is
a
federal
standard,
but
the
eighth
circuit
is
entitled
to
apply
the
specificity
and
the
application
that
it's
given
to
this,
so
the
eighth
circuit's
entitled
to
rely
on
its
cases
in
reversing.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
that's
what
they're
going
to
tell
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
didn't
he
seek
a
coa?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
pro
se
prisoner.
he
gets
his...
all
the
claims
are
exhausted,
it's
dismissed.
and
he
seeks
a
coa
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
it
be
applicable
to
state
prosecutors
if
it
is
not
a
rule.
i
don't
understand
that.
is
it
applicable
to
a
state
prosecutor
or
not?
if
a
state
prosecutor
asked
you
for
your
advice,
is
this
opinion
applicable.
and
you
tell
him
yes
or
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
must
follow
because
it's
the
law,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
where
did
chief
justice
stone
get
it
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
did
chief
justice
stone
get
it
from?
just
because
of
our
supervisory
power?
i
mean,
if
it's
just
federal
supervisory
power,
then
i
think
you
could
tell
the
counsel,
he
doesn't
have
to
follow
it,
it's
due
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
a
prosecutor
say,
one
of
the
factors
you
must
take
into
account
when
you
begin
to
deliberate
is
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
death
penalty?
deterrence
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
have
the
death
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
teach
us.
can
he
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
now
we
have
the
principle
that
you
can
talk
about
deterrence.
now
it
is
just
the
way
in
which
he
talked
about
deterrence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
think,
go
on
and
on...
suppose
he'd
mentioned
deterrence
six
times?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
this
only
in
a
footnote
in
your
reply
brief.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
bio.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
the
prosecution
had
not
opened
the
door,
that
would
have
been
improper?
you
overrule...
the
judge
said
counsel,
you
can't
argue
about
sending
a
message
for
life?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
think
the
trial
court
could
tell
the
defense
counsel
that
the
defense
counsel
cannot
argue
to
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
is
nothing
more
precious
than
life
and
that's
what
we're
asking
you
to
decide
here
and
we
want
you
to
assert
the
values
of
this
community
that
we
value
life?
you
can't
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
moral
culpability
that
you
take
moral
instruction
from
thieves
murderers
on
the
street,
as
opposed
to
those
higher
standards
for
which
society
seeks
to
aspire?
is
that
moral
culpability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
moral
culpability
for
you
to
take
as
an
example
for
your
behavior
the
criminal
population?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
talking
about
moral
culpability.
is
it
part
of
your
moral
culpability
that
you
take
your
values,
your
instructions,
your
behavior
from
criminals,
as
opposed
to
people
who
uphold
the
law
in
society?
is
that
part
of
moral
culpability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
isn't
it
relevant
what's
happening
on
the
streets,
etcetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
eighth
circuit
had
had
lawrence
in
front
it,
it
would
have
ruled
differently?
or
should
it
have
ruled
differently,
in
respect
to
lawrence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
lawrence
the
eighth
circuit
would
have
been
wrong?
