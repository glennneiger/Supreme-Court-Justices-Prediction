justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
why
is
it
improper
for,
for
the
prosecution
to
argue
that,
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
given
the
aggravating
factors
and
the
lack
of
mitigating
factors,
the
brutality
of
the
crime,
the
only
sensible
decision
for
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
is
the
death
penalty?
that's
an
improper
argument?
doesn't
that
amount
to
saying
you
have
a
duty
to
come
back
with
the
death
penalty?
why
can't
the
prosecution
argue
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
concession.
surely,
the
prosecutor
was
not
telling
this
jury
that
in
all
capital
cases
you
have
to
come
in
with
a
death
verdict.
surely,
although
he
didn't
explicitly
mention
the
evidence,
the
underlying
premise
of
his
argument
was
sometimes
when
you
have
a
case
this
bad,
you
have
to
do
your
duty.
nobody
likes
to
kill,
but
just
as
soldiers
sometimes
have
to
do
that
if
that's
their
duty,
so
also
jurors,
if
you
really
believe
that
the
evidence
is
so
one-sided
in
favor
of
the
penalty
that
the
state
is
asking
for,
it's
your
duty
to
bring
the
death
verdict.
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
said
he
was
not
supposed
to
do
these
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
the
law
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
that
in
the
text,
doesn't
it,
"clearly
established
by
the
supreme
court?
"
is
that
not
in
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
didn't
say
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
and
we
might
not
well
have
taken
the
case
had
that
point
been
raised
in
the
bil.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
much
more
limited
point,
as
i
understand
it.
your
more
limited
point
is
simply
that
this
is
not
clearly
established
law
pronounced
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
area
of
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
it
both--
ways,
counsel.
i
mean,
you're
really
losing
me
here.
either
it
is
our
supervisory
power
and
therefore
the
states
don't
have
to
follow
it,
or
it
is
more
than
our
supervisory
power
and
the
states
do
have
to
follow
it.
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
way
to
straddle
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
curative
instruction
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
how
do
you
it
failed
to
consider?
i
mean,
is
there
an
obligation
to
respond
to
every
single
point
that's
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
refuse
to
accept
argument
on
those
points?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
did
consider
it,
you
mean
they
did
not
respond
to
that
argument
in
their
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
for
sure
that
they
didn't
consider
it.
i
mean,
it
may
be
argument
to
them.
how
could
they
not
have
considered
it?
they
must
have
not
considered
it
important,
but
that's
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
i
recall,
he
didn't
just
say
it
is
bigger
than
weaver.
he
went
on
to
discuss,
you
know,
the
drug
gangs.
and
he
says,
they're
not
going
to
be
affected
by
the
threat
of
going
to
prison.
they
will
be
affected
by
the
threat
of
dying.
it
seemed
to
me
he
tied
it
very,
very
closely
into
deterrence.
and
if
you
say
that
deterrence
is
okay
for
him
to
refer
to,
i
don't
know
how
there's
anything
left
to
your
argument
about
his
saying
it's
bigger
than
weaver.
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
never
mind
the
facts?
let's,
let's
give
this
guy
the
death
penalty
as
a
napoleon
said,
"por
encourage
les
autres".
you
know,
he
said
it
didn't
matter
which,
whether
the
general
was
guilty
of,
of
cowardice
or
not;
it
would
help
to
encourage
the
others
to
execute
him.
where
is
there
anything
like
that
argument
here?
i
don't
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
let
a
person
who
is
as
guilty
as
william
weaver
go,
you're
affecting
not
just
william
weaver,
you're
affecting
the
whole
war
on
drugs,
you're
affecting
the...
what's
wrong
with
that?
i...
i
fail
to
see
any
indication
here
that
he's
telling
the
jury
never
mind
the
facts.
never
mind
how...
you
know...
how
horrible
you
think
the
crime
was.
never
mind
all
of
the
instructions
that
the
judge
gives
you
about
aggravating
factors
and
mitigating
factors.
forget
all
of
that.
kill
william
weaver
because
it's
bigger
than
him.
i...
i
just
don't...
i
just
don't
see
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
the
supreme
court
cases
going
to
the
other
points,
they
didn't...
did
any
of
them
involve
a
separate
penalty
phase?
they
were
all
just
in
the
guilt,
guilt
phase
of
a
non-capital
case,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that,
so
that
when
the
prosecutor
was
urging
particular
action,
he
was
urging
the
jury
to
find
a
person
guilty.
he
was
not
just
urging
them
what
penalty
is
better
or
worse.
he
was
saying
for
these
reasons
you
should
find
the
individual
guilty.
that's
quite
different
it
seems
to
me
from
the
situation
in
which
guilt
has
already
been
established.
the
trial's
done.
this
person
is
guilty,
and
the
only
thing
they're
arguing
about
is
what
the
penalty
ought
to
be.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
analogize,
you
know,
from
the
one
situation
to
the
other
in
determining
what
kind
of
argument
is
proper.
because
in
the
former
situation
when
the...
if
the
prosecutor
says
this
is
not
just
about
this
defendant,
it's
about
the
whole
society,
he's
urging
the
jury
to
find
the
person
guilty.
i
mean...
and
that's
crazy.
you
don't
find
the
person
guilty
in
order
to
stop
drug
trafficking.
but
you
do
impose
a
heavier
penalty
in
order
to
do
that.
so
i
just
don't,
don't
see
the
analogy
from
the
supreme
court
cases
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
different.
look...
it
could...
could...
would
defense
counsel
be
able
to
argue
during
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial,
in
an
ordinary
trial
where
there's
no
separate
phase,
"ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
person
has
a
large
family
that's
dependent
on
him;
he's
a
miserable
wretch.
"
"you
shouldn't
find
him
guilt.
"
"is
there
no
mercy
in
your
heart?
"
would
he
be
allowed
to
argue
that?
of
course
not.
can
he
argue
it
in
a
guilt
phase?
of
course
he
can.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
determining
what
arguments
the
prosecution
can
make
you
have
to
be
guided
by
what
arguments
the
defense
can
make.
the
defense
can
surely
come
in
and
say
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you're
being
called
upon
to
kill
somebody.
do
you
realize
what
a...
what
a
difficult,
overwhelming
thing
that
is?
and
then
you
say
the
prosecution
can't
come
in
and
say
ladies
and
gentlemen,
sometimes
if
you
do
your
duty,
you
have
to
kill.
this
is
the
law
here.
if
you
find
the
facts
this
way,
that's
your
duty.
i...
i...
i
think
you're,
you're
taking
hard
cases
very
much
out
of
context
by
applying
cases
that
relate
to
the
guilt
phase,
to
a
very
special
procedure
that
we've
set
up
in
capital
cases
which
is
called
the
guilt...
uh,
the
penalty
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
has
been
switched
here,
counsel.
the
question
before
us
is
not
whether
it
was
wrong,
even
if
you
answer
there's
plenty
of
supreme
court
precedent,
even
though
none
on
these
particular
facts,
to
convince
me
that
he
shouldn't
have
said
it.
that's
not
the
question
before
us.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
it
violates
fundamental
unfairness,
whether
it's
wrong
to
such
an
extent
that
it
invalidates
the
whole
prosecution
and...
and
sentence.
that's
quite
a
different
question.
i
can
acknowledge,
yeah,
the
prosecutor,
you
know,
shouldn't
do
it.
but
that
doesn't
lead
me
to
the,
automatically
to
the
conclusion
that
the
supreme
court
jurisprudence
shows
that
this
so
violates
fundamental
unfairness
that
the,
that
the
verdict
has
to
be
set
aside.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
serve
him
right?
i
mean,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
answer
the
argument,
fight
for
life,
always
fight
for
life?
how
do
you
answer
that
argument,
except
by
saying:
ladies
and
gentlemen,
sometimes,
sometimes
it's
your
duty
to
vote
for
death?
how
else
would
you
answer
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
was
that
this
habeas?
then
he
filed
a
subsequent
habeas
or
what?
