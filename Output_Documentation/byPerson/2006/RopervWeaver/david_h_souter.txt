h.
souter
well,
do
you
think
the
patton
argument
has
anything
to
do
with
the
evidence?
i
mean,
the
patton
argument...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
the
argument
that
referred
to
general
patton
was
an
argument
that,
number
one,
talked
about
his
addressing
the
troops
before
battle.
and
he
was
telling
the
troops
that
unfortunately
it
is
sometimes
their
duty
to
kill.
and
he
said:
go
out
there
and
do
your
duty,
which
i
assume
any
reasonable
listener
would
say,
go
out
there
and
kill.
if
a
prosecutor,
as
in
this
case,
tells
that
story
and
uses
that
analogy,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
is
not
an
argument
based
on
evidence,
but
an
argument
based
upon
the
situation,
the
situation
of
the
jurors
vis
a
vis
a
capital
defendant.
and
i
would
suppose
that
the
reasonable
inference
from
the
argument
is
that
they
have
a
duty
to
go
out
there
to
kill,
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
that
does
not
sound
to
me
like
an
argument
based
upon
the
evidence
specific
to
this
defendant
and
specific
to
this
case.
now,
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're...
you're
saying
look,
he
can
make
a
general
statement
that
we
have
a
death
penalty
in
part
for
its
deterrent
function,
but
he
cannot
make
the
argument
that
you
ought
to
apply
the
death
penalty
in
this
case
solely
for
deterrent
reasons,
i.e.,
reasons
unanchored
in
the
culpability
of
this
particular
defendant.
