mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
former
prosecutor's
brief
makes--
clear,
george
mr.
weaver's
case
contained
a
number
of
improper
and
mutually
reinforcing
statements
which
exploited
the
authority
of
his
office,
analogized
the
jury's
duties
to
that
of
soldiers
in
war
time,
injected
extraneous
matters
into
the
proceedings,
and
appealed
to
the
jurors'
passions
and
prejudice.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
the
historical
context
is
different,
but
this
was
set
up
in
this
case
by
informing
the
jurors
that
we
were
involved
in
a
war,
in
a
war
on
drugs
in
society.
and
then
he
uses
the
same
story,
analogizing
jurors'
responsibilities
to
that
of
soldiers
in
a
war.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
put
that
comment
in
the
context
in
which
it
occurred.
not
only
in
the
broader
context
and
the
repeated...
the
prosecutor
repeatedly
leveraging
the
power
of
his
office
behind
this,
but
this
came
right
on
the
heels
of
him
saying,
i'm
the
top
law
enforcement
officer
in
this
county.
i
decide
in
which
cases
we
seek
the
death
penalty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
was
objected
to,
and
the
objection
was
sustained.
that
doesn't
mean
that
comment--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
agree
with
that.
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
irrelevant
for
the
due
process
totality
of
circumstances
analysis.
and
then
he
proceeds
from
there
directly
in
to
the
patton
analogy,
and
i
think
if
you
read
that
analogy
in
context,
he
is
telling
them
you're
soldiers
in
a
war,
you
have
a
duty
to
kill,
i'm
like
patton,
i'm
telling
you
it's
your
duty
to
kill,
go
kill.
if
you
read
that
logically--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--the
decision
that
was
violated
was
the
rule
of
darden,
donnelly,
and
romano,
which
is
that--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
think
darden
established
the
rule.
this
court
applied
it
to
the
penalty
phase
in
romano,
and
thus
the
darden
rule
that
if
a
prosecutor's
comments,
the
totality--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
but
logically,
if
you
have
established
a
rule
for
closing
arguments,
you
established
it,
you
then
say
it
is
applicable
to
the
penalty
phase
for
the
admission
of
evidence,
it
would
be
completely
illogical
to
say
it
didn't
govern
penalty
phase
closing
arguments.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that
is
what
this
court's
decisions
say,
chief
justice
roberts.
i
think
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
have
two
different
positions
on
that.
the
first
is
that
any
state
court
decision
finding
this
argument
in
its
totality
based
on
what
happened
and
based
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
said
that
didn't
render
the
proceedings
fundamentally
unfair
would
be
an
unreasonable
application
of
darden
and
donnelly.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
this
case
said
the
decision
was
unreasonable
because
it
failed
to
consider
significant
portions
of
mr.
weaver's
challenge
to
this
argument.
it
did
the
analysis
under
a
state
law
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
it
refused
to
consider
or
failed
to
consider
several
components
of
his
claim.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no.
but
they...
on
the
first
point,
did
they
refuse
to...
did
they
fail
to
consider
a
number
of
the
challenges
like
the
patton
analogy,
that's
clear.
he
raised
that
in
his
brief.
he
said
this
was
something
i'm
complaining
about.
they
did
not
consider
it.
he
raised
the
point
about--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--they
did
not
refer
to
it
in
their
opinion.
mr.
john
h.
blume
he
also
raised
the
point
about
this
is
bigger
than
william
weaver.
and
that
was
improper.
and
when
the
state
court
cited
what
he
said,
they
chose
to
ellipses
that
out,
and
didn't
even
put
in--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
don't
think
this
can
properly
be
considered
a
deterrence
argument.
when
you
say
over
and
over,
this
is
far
more
important
than
william
weaver,
this
goes
way
beyond
william
weaver,
this
is
bigger
than
william
weaver,
this
doesn't
just
pertain
to
william
weaver,
then
you
add
that
in
with
the
number
of
comments
about
you
need
to
give
this
person
the
death
penalty--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--uh-huh.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
he
could
say
that.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
my
point
is
i
don't
believe
this
is
really
a
deterrence
argument.
deterrence
is
not
a
substitute
for
moral
culpability.
we
allow
the
deterrent
function
of
the
death
penalty
as
a
justification
for
it,
but
you
couldn't
give
the
death
penalty
to
somebody
who
didn't
deserve
it
under
the
state's
scheme,
in
order
to
further
deterrence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
the
import
of
this
argument
is
you
should
give
the
person
the
death
penalty
even
if
you're
not
sure
he
deserves
it
in
order
to
further
the
deterrent
function
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
correct.
not
because,
what
this
statement
did.
especially--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
that
us
the
logical
inference
from
the
six
or
seven
times
he
says...
in
variety
of...
he
says
this
is
bigger
than
william
weaver.
the
one
thing
you've
got
to
understand
is
this
is
far
more
important
than
william
weaver;
this
is,
goes
way
beyond
william
weaver;
this
does
not
pertain
just
to
william
weaver.
he
says
that
on
six
or
eight
occasions.
and
i
think
you
could
interpret
that...
the
logical
interpretation--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--of
course,
he
does
actually
say
kill
him
now
at
another
point
in
there.
but
i
think
if
you
take
those
comments,
you
also
look
at
those
in
the
context
of
where
he
goes
on
and
on
about
the
consequences;
you
need
to
send
a
message
to
the
drug
dealers,
that's
a
huge
theme--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
as
long
as
it
is
a
blanket
sort
of
statement,
that
one
purpose
of
the
death
penalty
is
deterrence,
that
would
probably
be
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
not
what
is
happening
here,
justice
kennedy,
especially
when
it
is
tied
in
to
that,
to
send
a
message
and
then
he
also
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
consequences.
if
you
don't
sentence
this
person
to
death,
then
the
animals
will
reign
in
the
jungle
and
we
can't
have
that
in
a
civilized
society
and
there's
no
point
in
having
jurors,
the
dope
peddlers
prevail.
you
put
all
that
together,
he
is
telling
these
people
as
the
prosecutor
in
this
county.
if
you
don't
give
this
person
the
death
penalty
there
will
be
all
these
adverse
social
consequences.
and
you
wrap
all
this
up;
there
is
no
conscientious
prosecute
who
could
possibly
believe
that
these
statements
were
proper.
no.
this
argument
is
an
outlier;
it
is
beyond
the
bounds;
it
contains
essentially
improper
comments
in
virtually
every
category
that
this
court--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--judge
bowman--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--judge
bowman
did
say
that.
but
i
believe
the
essence
of
his
dissent
was
that,
i
think
that
he
made
the
mistake
which
the
petitioners
made
in
the
cert
petition,
and
he
thought
that
there
was
no
clearly
established
federal
law.
a
point
which
is
essentially
conceded
at
this
point
in
the
proceedings.
i
wanted
to--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
if
i'm...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i'm
wrong.
but
even...
i
don't
think
it
is
also
under
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
williams
versus
taylor,
you
don't
have
to,
this
doesn't
works
at
the
level
of
saying
well,
any
one
judge
is
unreasonable.
the
point
is,
it's
an
objective
standard,
not
is
this
judge,
you
know,
somehow
out
of
touch
here?
and
i
think...
so...
i
wanted
to
make
one
point
before
i
forge
about
it,
to
correct
one
thing
that
petitioner
said.
mr.
weaver
filed
this
prior
to
the
act.
it
was
dismissed.
he
did
request
counsel
and
a
coa.
he
did
appeal
this
in
the
eighth
circuit
in
his
first
appeal.
he
appealed
the
improper
dismissal
of
his
petition.
the
district
court
initially
granted
the
writ
on
batson
grounds.
he
appealed
the
fact
that
it
should
be...
his
case
should
not
be
subject
to
the
act--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
was
not
raised
in
the
bio.
i
did
not
represent
mr.
weaver
at
that
time.
but
i
thought
it
was
my
obligation
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
raise
this
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity.
mr.
john
h.
blume
okay.
let
me...
i
want
to
back
up,
and
i
want
to
take
on
the
premise
of
the
question.
which
may
be
a
mistake,
but
i
think
in
determining,
the
first
part
of
the
donnelly/darden
standard
is
you
look
at
what
the
prosecutor
argued
and
whether
it
was
improper.
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
have
a
united
states
supreme
court
case
directly
on
point
for
everything
the
prosecutor
said
on
that.
there
are
decisions
from
this
court
on
a
number
of
things
he
said.
there
are
also
other
touchstones,
for
example,
the
standards
on
criminal
justice
which
regulate
what
prosecutors
can
say.
then
the
way
i
understand
this
clearly
established
federal
law
to
work,
is
you
take
what
the
prosecutor
said,
you
examine
that
in
light
of
what
happened,
what
defense
counsel
did,
what
the
trial
judge
did,
and
the
weight
of
the
overall
evidence.
and
if
you
believe
that
the
prosecutor's
arguments
rendered
the
proceedings
fundamentally
unfair,
then
there's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
i
don't
think
i
have...
you
have
to
show
that
there's
some
supreme
court
case
directly
on
point
going
to
each
particular
comment.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
think
that,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
a
principle
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
reaffirmed
that
a
prosecutor
is
not
supposed
to
leverage
his
opinion
and
the
prestige
of
his
office
behind
a
particular
outcome,
would
apply
any
less
at
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial
than
at
the
guilt
phase
of
a
capital
trial.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
disagree
with
that,
and
to
this
extent.
can
a
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
argue
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
capital
trial
you
should
not
sentence
this
person
to
death
because
they've
had
a
hard
life?
yes.
of
course
you
can.
and
why
can
you
do
that?
because
according
to
this
court's
cases,
that
goes
directly
to
the
individual's
moral
culpability
and
whether
they
deserve
the
death
penalty.
the
problem
with
many
of
the
arguments
which
were
made
in
this
case
is
they
are
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
individual's
moral
blameworthiness
and
they
can
the
jury
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
order
to
stop
larger
issues,
to
stop
crime,
to
protect
society.
mr.
john
h.
blume
to
send
a
message.
and
if
you
don't
send
a
message,
chaos
will
prevail
and
the
animals
will
reign
in
the
jungle.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no.
i
think
the
important...
by
the
time
defense
counsel
said
that,
the
prosecutor
in
his
opening
statement
had
already
made
the
send
a
message
statement
about
five
times.
she
was
trying
in
that
one
limited
instance
to
tackle
that
and
say
well,
okay,
if
you
give
him
life
that's
a
message,
too.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
that
would
have
been
completely
within
the
trial
court's
discretion.
mr.
john
h.
blume
maybe.
but
i
think
that
what
she...
but
what
she's
saying
here,
though,
is
directly
responsive.
and
that
is
also
a
factor
which
this
court
has
noted
in
its
decisions.
mr.
john
h.
blume
of
course.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
would...
there
you
would
easily
just
look
to
this
court's
eighth
amendment
decisions
which
say--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--right.
it
wouldn't
be
an...
but
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
principles--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
think,
you
know,
at
some
point,
right,
you
can
say
well,
you
don't
have
a
case
on
point
because
no
one
has
said
anything
so
outrageous.
if
a
prosecutor
went
up
and
said
look,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
judge
is
going
to
tell
you
about
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances;
forget
all
that
baloney,
go
in
there,
you
know,
put
all
that
out
of
your
brain,
and
give
him
death.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
question--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
let
me
tackle
that
head-on.
there
were
a
number
of
improper
comments
made
in
this
case.
most,
many
of
them...
a
number
of
them
were
objected
to
and
the
objection
was
overruled.
some
of
them
were
not
objected
to.
the
only
instructions
they
got
were
two
curative
instructions
on
two
points
and
a
general
evidence,
not
arguments,
instruction.
so
nothing
was
really
done
in
the
context
to
ameliorate
the
presence
of
these
comments.
and
despite
what
the
petitioner
says,
this
was
not
a
strong
case
for
death.
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
circumstantial
and
hotly
contested.
even
the
prosecutor
in
his
penalty
phase
acknowledged,
look,
he
might
be
innocent,
but
kill
him
anyway.
the
state
presented
no
additional
evidence
in
aggravation
of
punishment.
mr.
weaver
had
no
prior
record
other
than
a
misdemeanor
conviction.
there
was
substantial
mitigating
evidence
presented
regarding
his
character,
his
good
deeds,
and
other
things
he
had
done
in
the
community
and
his
adaptability
to
confinement.
this
was
not
a
strong
case
for
death.
so
you
take
these
comments,
which
were...
they're
trying
to
contrast...
this
argument
is
worse
than
newlon
in
most
respects.
it
was
made
five
weeks
after
he
was
told
that
this
argument
rendered
another
trial
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
believe
there
were
six.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
agree.
but
to
say
that...
and
they
found...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that's
not
part
of
the
totality
of
the
proceedings.
but
there's
one
significant
point
there
that
also
i
think
needs
to
be
taken
into
account.
he
was
a
witness,
but
he
was
also
a
drug
dealer
and
involved
in
the
drug
trade
and
was
a
straw
purchaser
for
these
shurn
families.
and
in
many
instances--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i'm
not
suggesting
it
serves
him
right.
i'm
suggesting
that
whether
juries
impose
death
often
depends
in
part
as
well
on
the
moral
blameworthiness
or
how
they
perceived
the
victim.
this
was
not
like
witness,
an
innocent
witness.
this
was
somebody
who
was
involved
in
that.
and
that
normally
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
prosecution
to
obtain
a
death
sentence.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
in
general
they
stick
to
the
evidence.
they
can
argue
that
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
crime
itself
warrants
the
ultimate
punishment
and
focus
on...
the
focus
of
the
penalty
phase
is
supposed
to
be
on
the
individual's
moral
culpability
and
whether
they
deserve
the
death
penalty
based
on
what
they
did.
this
argument,
most
of
this
argument
i
believe,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
it
went
on
for
pages
and
there
was
no
mention
really
in
any
substance
of
william
weaver
and
what
he
had
done.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
don't
think
it's
the
only
factor,
but
i
was
responding
to
the
question
of
what
should
a
prosecutor
do
and
in
fact
what
most
prosecutors
do
in
most
cases.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
something
probably
like
that
would
be.
but
this...
again,
this
went
way
beyond
that.
the
other
thing
that
you
have
to
look
at
here
is
that
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
and
if
you
don't
give
him
death
chaos
will
reign,
society
will
fall
apart,
there's
no
point
in
having
a
death
penalty,
and
the
animals
will
reign
in
the
jungle
and
you
can't
that
have
that
in
a
civilized
society.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
still...
i'm
not
trying
to
be
thick.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
might
be
part
of
the
picture
of
what
this
person
is
like.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
don't
think
it's
proper
to
say
if
you
don't
give
this
person
death
then
all
these
other
things
which
are
bad
for
society
are
going
to
happen.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
there's
beyond
and
there's
way
beyond
and
there's
beyond
the
pale.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
these
things
that
were
said
in
this
case...
i
have
read
hundreds
of
these
arguments...
no
conscientious
prosecutor
could
have
thought
that
this
was
appropriate.
mr.
john
h.
blume
you
could
answer
it
that,
look
at
what
this
person
did.
you
look
at
his
crime.
we
have
the
death
penalty
in
this
state.
in
some
cases
it's
appropriate.
it's
appropriate
in
this
case.
it's
not
appropriate
to
say:
i'm
the
prosecutor,
i
decide
in
which
cases
we
seek
death.
mr.
john
h.
blume
you're
talking
about
on
the
basis
that
he
filed
before
the
act?
mr.
john
h.
blume
he
filed
before
the
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
and
said,
believing
erroneously--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
was
argued
in
his
initial
habeas.
it
was
appealed
to
the
eighth
circuit,
because
the
eighth
circuit
initially
granted
the
writ
on
batson
grounds.
so
he
appealed
it
at
that
point
and
the
eighth
circuit
said,
basically
with
very
little
analysis,
determined
that
aedpa
applied
because
he
had
to
refile
after
the
act
and
aedpa
applied
to
petitions
filed
after
the
act.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
was
the
same
habeas
proceeding.
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
same.
it
was
then
remanded
back
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
on
this
ground
and
then
it
went
up
on
appeal.
i
don't
think
he
would
have
been
under
any
obligation
to
appeal
it
again,
having
sort
of
gotten
a
ruling
on
that
in
the
same
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
believe
that...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
i
believe
lawrence
makes
clear
that
the
district
court
made
a
fundamental
mistake
in
law
in
dismissing
his
petition
and
should
not
be--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
lawrence
made
clear
what
i
think
should
have
probably
been
clear
beforehand,
that
you
didn't
have
to
seek
cert
to
this
court
in
order
to
exhaust
a
petition,
but
that
was
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
ruling.
thank
you.
