it's
not
just
in
isolation.
didn't
this
prosecutor
constantly
say
this
case
is
not
about
weaver,
this
case
is
larger
than
weaver.
i
think
several
times
in
the
closing
the
jurors
were
told:
think
big,
think
the
large
picture,
don't
think
about
this
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just...
that's
a
bit
inconsistent
with
your
point
that
newlon
is
distinguishable
because
there
were
no
objections
at
all
and
that
was
the
reason
for
the
court
saying
this
goes
too
far
to
the
prosecutor.
but
now
you
say
when
there
are
objections--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--certain
statements.
there
are
were
many
objections
made
here
that
were
overruled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
that
extent
the
two
cases
were
the
same
because
in
newlon
there
were
no
objections
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
were
two
cases
cited
as
involving
the
same
prosecutor?
was
it
shurn
also?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
there
was
a
significant
overlap
in
the
three
charges
in
the
three
cases.
the
prosecutor
had
been
told
in
two
of
them,
you
went
too
far.
in
this
one,
just
in
terms
of
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
the
closing
argument,
is
this
less
offensive
or
would
you
say
they're
all
on
a
par?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
slip
on
the
district
court's
part,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
that
original
petition
that
was
dismissed
because
he
had
filed
a
cert
petition
to
this
court
should
not
have
been
dismissed,
it
should
have
been
held,
in
which
case
the
petition
would
have
been
timely
and
would
not
have
been
trumped
by
an
aedpa
variant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
judge
bowman
said
were
it
not
for
aedpa
this
case
might
come
out...
in
his
view
this
case
might
have
come
out
differently.
