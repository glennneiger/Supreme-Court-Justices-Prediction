justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
sort
of
preliminary
question.
supposing
the
prosecutor
misstated
the
law
in
his
closing
argument.
would
that
be
reviewable
in
this
court
under
aedpa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
his
argument
here
contained
any
misstatements
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
the
argument
based
on
the
general
patton
analogy
told
the
jurors
they
had
a
duty
to
do
what
he
suggested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
argument
otherwise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
if
he
said
in
so
many
words,
you
have
a
duty
to
return
the
death
penalty,
that
would
have
been
a
misstatement
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
think
this
could
be
so
interpreted?
you
don't
think
you
could
interpret
that,
that
passage,
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
your
concession
about
the
duty
is
based
on
chief
justice
stone's
opinion
in
viereck,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
did
involve
the
very
word
"duty".
justice
john
paul
stevens
chief
justice
stone's
opinion
in
viereck
talked
about
telling
the
jury
that
they
have
a
duty
and
condemned
that.
that's
probably
why
you
made
the
concession,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
your
position:
we
are
trying
to
find
cases
that
clearly
establish
law
by
decisions
of
this
court.
do
you
include
in
that
group
of
cases,
cases
such
as
berger
against
the
united
states,
and
viereck
against
the
united
states,
which
were
direct
review
of
federal
cases
in
which
they
say
there
was
a
denial
of
the
fair
trial,
but
they're
not
setting
aside
state
cases?
would
it
be
proper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
rely
on
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
those
cases
say
in
so
many
words
it
deprives
you
of
a
fair
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
my
question?
because
there's
a
legal
question
here
about
what
law
we
can
look
to
under
aedpa.
and
actually,
of
course,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
aedpa
applies,
i
suppose.
because
actually,
wasn't
this
habeas
petition
filed
two
days
before
aedpa
was...
there's
a
footnote
in
the
red
brief
that
says...
raises
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
sit
down?
in
the
viereck
opinion,
chief
justice
stone
reversed
in
that
case.
and
one
of
the
reasons
was
the
prosecutor
indulged
in
an
appeal
wholly
irrelevant
to
any
facts
or
issues
in
the
case,
the
purpose
and
effect
of
which
could
only
have
been
to
arouse
passion
and
prejudice.
that's
part
of
our
federal
law.
is
that
law
applicable
in
this
case,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
either
directly...
it's
either
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
rule
can
be
ignored
by
state
prosecutors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the
question,
i
suppose,
is
whether
that
is
a
constitutional
rule.
it
is
established
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
an
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
stone
a
good
many
years
ago.
but
you're
argument
is
it
is
not
applicable
to
state
prosecutors,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
blume,
before
your
time
is
up,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
question.
i'm
still
troubled
about
whether
aedpa
applies.
and
was
it
argued
in
any
court
below?
was
the
question
actually
ruled
on
after
an
adversarial
presentation
as
to
whether
aedpa
applies
or
does
not
apply?
as
i
understand
it,
it
either
does
or
it
doesn't
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
argued.
but
was
it
discussed
in
any
of
the
lower
court
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
days
before
the
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
mean
in
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
lawrence
had
gone
the
other
way,
then
it
also...
then
it
would
be
right.
in
other
words,
whether
aedpa
applies
really
is
a
function
of
our
decision
in
lawrence?
