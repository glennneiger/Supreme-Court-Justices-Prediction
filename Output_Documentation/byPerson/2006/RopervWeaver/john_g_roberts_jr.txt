chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument--
today
in
case
06-313,
roper
versus
weaver.
ms.
spillars.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
didn't...
haven't
applied
it
to
a
penalty
phase
closing
argument,
but
we've
certainly
applied
the
general
standard
to
the
penalty
phase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
counsel.
maybe,
counsel,
if
you
could
answer
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'm
looking
at
the
quote,
the
statement,
the
reference
to
patton,
and
i
have
to
say
i
don't
read
it
as
imposing
a
duty.
it
says
what
the
prosecutor
says
is
that
sometimes
you've
got
to
kill
and
sometimes
you've
got
to
risk
death
because
it's
right.
his
point
is
that
at
some
point,
at
some
times,
you
have
to
impose
death
because
it's
right,
not
because
it's
your
duty
as
a
soldier.
now,
where
is
the
reference
to
you
have
this
duty
as
a
soldier
in
the
prosecutor's
statements?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
those
direct
federal
cases
were
interpreting
the
constitutional
provisions
directly,
they
would
count
as
established
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
blume?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
objected
to
and
the
objection
was
sustained,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
in
that
case,--
aedpa
says
we
look
to
clearly
established
law
by
our--
u.s.
supreme
court
decisions.
which
is
the
clearest
u.s.
supreme
court
decision
that
was
violated
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
pick
which
one
do
you
think
is
the
most
directly
applicable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
romano.
romano
was
an
introduction
of
evidence
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
simply
the
level
of
generality
at
which
the
guiding
principles
were
articulated,
which
helps
when
you're
applying
it,
but
in
determining...
it
is
the
point
judge
bowman
in
dissent
that
when
you
don't
have
a
case
that's
close,
that
you
have
more
leeway
in
terms
of
the
deference
to
the
court,
because
it's
not
a
clearly
established
precedent
of
the
supreme
court.
yes,
there
are
the
jenner
cases
that
establish
the
general
principles,
but
the
question
is
how
clearly
those
were
contravened
before
you
can
say
it
violated
clearly
established
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
judge...
judge
bowman
would
be
an
unreasonable
prosecutor?
he
dissented;
he
thought
these
were
not
unreasonable
on
the
basis
of
on
clearly
established
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
standard
is
unreasonable
in
light
of
clearly
established
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
no,
he
specifically
recognized
there
was
nothing
on
all
fours
and
that
there
these
other
generally
applicable
decisions
and
he
thought
the
state
courts
had
broad...
a
broader
range
when
there
was
no
decision
on
all
fours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
reading
at
the
bottom
of
page
820
in
the
petition
appendix.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to...
to
send
a
message?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the
defense
lawyer
said
to
the
jury
in
his
closing
was
if
you
vote
for
life,
you
are
sending
a
message.
he
said
if
you
vote
for
life,
you
are
still
doing
your
duty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
was
that
message...
a
different
message,
i
guess,
but
he
can
say
send
a
message,
but
the
prosecutor
can't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
recital
was
not
a
complete
picture
of
the
case.
this
was
an
assassination
of
a
witness
in
a
federal
drug
prosecution,
with
how
many
shots
to
the
head?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
six.
and
the
jury
determined
unanimously
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
was
the
guy
who
did
it.
so
you
do
have
to
look
at
the
penalty
phase
in
the
context
of
those
facts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you...
what
should
a
prosecutor's
closing...
penalty
phase
argument
look
like?
what
are
the
sorts
of
things
that
he
should
be
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
defense
argument
was
not
focused
on
weaver
either.
the
defense
counsel
said
it
was
a
vote
for
life,
fight
for
it.
always
fight
for
life,
always,
always.
the
argument
by
the
defense
wasn't...
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine
in
a
penalty
phase
how
the
arguments
wouldn't
extend
beyond
the
particular
individuals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
blume.
ms.
spillars,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
06-313,
roper
versus
weaver
the
court
has
dismissed
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
improvidently
granted.
i
have
concurred
separately
in
that
result.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissent
joined
by
justices
thomas
and
alito.
