justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
guess
if
you
had
just
alleged
the
last
part
of
paragraph
51,
plaintiffs
have
alleged,
plaintiffs
allege
upon
information
and
belief,
et
cetera,
without
the
detail
that
you
provided,
would
that
have
been
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
omit
all
the
allegations
about
parallel
conduct
and
the
other
allegations
that
you
think
provide
a
basis
for
inferring
a
conspiracy
from
the
parallel
conduct,
if
you
omit
all
that
but
you
just
include
the
last
part
of
51,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
pled
more
than
you
had
to,
and
it's
clear
from
what
you
pled
that
you
were
drawing
an
implausible
inference?
can't
the
complaint
then
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
take
the
form
9
where
you
take
the
form
complaint
for
an
automobile
accident,
and
suppose
what
it
says
is,
i
was
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
at
a
particular
place
in
time.
i
was
hit
by
a
compact
car
with
massachusetts
plates.
the
defendant
owns
the
compact
car
with
massachusetts
plates.
that's
the
complaint.
the
court
can't
dismiss
that
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
when
it's
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
claim
that
you're,
that
the
basis
for
suing
the
defendant
is
a
totally
implausible
inference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
it
reveals
that
the
only
basis
for
identifying
this
person
as
the
defendant
is
the
fact
that
the
person
has
a
massachusetts
license
plate
and
a
compact
car?
