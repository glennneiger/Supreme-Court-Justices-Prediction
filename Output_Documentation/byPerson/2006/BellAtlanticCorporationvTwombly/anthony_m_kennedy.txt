but
of
course,
there
the
legal
standard
was
not
clear.
and
the
dura
case,
i
looked
at,
and
perhaps
you
disagree
based
on
what
you...
what
i
have
just
heard,
and
i
thought
dura
was
a
lack
of
proximate
cause.
they
just
didn't
show
any
relation
between
the
injury
they
alleged
to
have
suffered,
and
their
own.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
the
way
i
read
dura.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
the
negligently
drove
case,
the
plaintiff
negligently
drove
over...
the
defendant
negligently
drove
over
the
plaintiff,
if
it's
not
specific
as
to
time
and
place
it
must
be
dismissed?
if
it's
specific
as
to
time
and
place
it's,
it
withstands
the
motion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
it
does
say
within
the
last
10
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
a
case,
do
you
have
a
case
i
can
look
to
that
tells
me
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
reading
from
the
swierkiewicz
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
his
hypothetical
is
all
you've
done
is
to
allege
the
final
sentence
without
the
preceding
clause,
the
five
or
six
lines
before
there's
a
comma.
that's
out.
all
there
is
is
the
allegation
of
the
conspiracy.
is
that
enough
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
hypothetical
is
without
the
preceding
clause.
is
that
enough--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
enough
in
this
case
for
what
justice
alito
asked,
and
i
think
we
are
interested
in
the
answer
that
you
make
given
this
complaint
in
this
case
that
we
are
faced
with.
