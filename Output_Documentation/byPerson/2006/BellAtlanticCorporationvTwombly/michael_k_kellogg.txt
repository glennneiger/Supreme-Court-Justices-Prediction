mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
most
important
point
that
i
can
make
today
is
that
this
is
a
case
about
the
substantive
requirements
of
antitrust
law,
and
just
as
in
dura
and
in
blue
chip
stamps,
the
court
articulated
the
substantive
requirements
for
pleading
a
claim
under
the
securities
law,
and
just
as
in
anza,
it
did
so
under
rico,
so
too
in
associated
general
contractors,
in
trinko.
and
in
the
instant
case,
the
court
is
faced
with
the
question
of
what
a
plaintiff
needs
to
plead
in
order
to
state
a
claim
and
show
an
entitlement
to
relief
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
that
regard,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
paragraph
51
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
in
this
case,
which
is
at
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
which
summarizes
the
grounds
for
plaintiffs'
allegation
that
there
is
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
the
complaint
states,
and
i
quote,
"in
the
absence
of
any
meaningful
competition
among
the
defendants.
"
and,
quote,
in
light
of
the
parallel
course
of
conduct
that
each
engaged
in
to
prevent
competition,
the
plaintiffs...
the
defendants
conspired.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
does
not
state
a
claim.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
sentence
recites
the
language
of
the
sherman
act,
that
is
correct.
but
what
this
court's
cases
indicate
and
what
rule
8
requires--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
is
true
that
they
have
described
the
alleged
conspiracy,
but
what
dura,
associated
general
contractors,
and
other
cases
of
this
court
require
is
a
statement
of
facts
that
warrants
the
legal
conclusion
that
the
plaintiffs
wish
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--your
honor,
every
case
of
this
court
dealing
with
pleading
standards
has
indicated
that
it
is
not
sufficient
merely
to
recite
a
legal
conclusion,
and
claim
an
entitlement
to
relief
therefore.
in
dura,
for
example,
the
plaintiffs
claimed
proximate
cause
and
loss
causation,
and
the
court
said--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--your
honor,
in
the
context
in
which
this
claim
is
made,
the
allegation
of
agreement
or
conspiracy
is
not
a
statement
of
fact.
it
is
an
inference
that
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
draw
from
the
facts
that
they
allege
in
the
complaint.
context
here
is
everything.
in
form
9,
for
example,
justice
ginsburg,
or
in
the
case
of
sherkovitz,
you
had
a
specific
context.
you
had
a
time,
a
place,
individual
participants
named,
a
clear
injury
in
form
9,
a
broken
leg
as
a
report--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
but
you
have
a
direct
context...
justice
ginsburg,
you
had
a
direct
context
in
which
an
eyewitness
participant
in
the
event
is
claiming
negligence
on
behalf
of
the
driver
of
the
car.
in
the
instant
case,
we
have
no
injury
that's
separate
from
the
alleged
conspiracy,
and
we
have
no
time,
place
or
participants
for
the
alleged
conspirators.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
do
not
think
so,
because
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
would
cite,
for
example,
the
court's
decision
in
the
papasan
case,
where
the
plaintiffs
claimed
that
they
were
not
getting
a
minimally
adequate
education.
that
sounds
like
a
factual
statement.
but
what
the
court
expressly
said
in
that
case
is
that
we
do
not
have
to
accept
legal
conclusions
in
the
guise
of
factual
allegations.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
dura
is--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
think
dura
is
an
exact
analogy.
in
dura,
they
allege
proximate
cause,
they
allege
loss
causation.
and
the
court
said,
well,
let's
look
at
their
statement
of
facts,
which
only
showed
that
they
had
bought
at
an
inflated
price.
and
the
court
said
there
was
a
fatal
gap
between
that
factual
allegation
and
the
legal
conclusion
that
they
wished
to
draw.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
would
not
provide--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
grounds
upon
which
the
claim
is
based.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
some
facts
indicative
that
the
defendant
is
responsible
for
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--absolutely.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
our
position
would
not
be
different.
it's
the
uniform
view
of
the
cases
that
i
cited,
the
courts
of
appeals
and
a
requirement
of
rule...
rule
8
that
you
do
more
than
simply
parrot
the
words
of
the
cause
of
action
or
announce
legal
conclusions.
but
as
you
point
out,
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
is
certainly
true
that
all
they
have
alleged
is
conduct
from
which
they
seek
to
draw
an
inference
of
conspiracy.
and
they
have
made
that
quite
clear,
that
they
have
made
no
direct
allegation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
as
a
matter
of
substantive
antitrust
law,
what
this
court
said
in
matsushita
is
that
antitrust
law
limits
the
range
of
permissible
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
parallel
conduct.
and
if
all
you
have
is
parallel
conduct
that's
consistent,
on
the
one
hand,
with
conspiracy,
or
on
the
other
hand,
with
ordinary
business
judgment,
you
cannot
draw
an
inference
of
the
sort
that
the
plaintiffs
depend
upon
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
am.
i
would
say
that
that's
a...
that's
a
conclusion--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--if
there
were
a
specific
context
and
they
said--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
because
you
require--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--because
the
plaintiffs
here
were
very
careful,
in
light
of
rule
11,
not
to
make
any
direct
allegations
of
conspiracy,
not
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
time
and
place--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
they
make
it
clear
in
that
paragraph
that
it's
an
inference.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i'm
saying
that
it's
not
sufficient
to
state
a
claim.
just
as
the
allegation
that
there
was
lost
causation
in
dura,
or
that
there
was
harm
to
the
union
in
associated
general
contractors
or
there,
that
there
was
harm--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
ordinarily
in
a
complaint
like
that,
you
could
file
a
12(e)
motion
and
ask
for
more
specificity.
our
problem--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--our
problem
with
the
current
complaint
is
not
a
lack
of
specificity,
it's
quite
specific.
it
provides
color
maps
and
such.
the
problem
is
that
the
facts
specifically
alleged
simply
don't
amount
to
an
antitrust
violation
because
they
don't
support
the
inference
that
the
plaintiffs
ask
the
court
to
draw.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
what
they
are
saying
and
what
matsushita
and
the
other
courses,
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
parallel
conduct
indicate,
is
that
that's
not
a
fair
inference
from
parallel
conduct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
correct.
but
the
court
announced
that
as
a
principle
of
substantive
law.
they
said
substantive
antitrust
law
limits
the
range
of
permissible
inferences.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
plaintiffs
need
the
sort
of
specificity
or
certainly
any
evidence
at
the
pleadings
stage.
for
example--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i...
i
should
not
agree
to
that.
that's
simply
adding
the
word
orally.
it's
certainly
fair
when
you
are
talking
about
a
nationwide
class
over
a
period
of
10
years
attacking
an
entire
industry
to
suggest
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
give
some
indication
of
what
it
is
that
the
defendants
have
done
that
is
wrong.
some
concrete
basis
for
the
court
to
believe
there
is
a
reason
to
go
forward
to
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well
certainly,
form
9
is
very
specific.
it
gives
a
specific
corner,
it
gives
a
time,
it
gives
the
names
of
the
participants.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
don't
think
that's
sufficient,
your
honor.
but
with
a...
with
a--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--with
a
negligence
case
a
12(e)
motion
could
then
specify
the
actual
time
and
place,
but
the
plaintiffs
here
have
had
ample
opportunity
to
amend
their
complaint
to
supplement.
if
they
had
any
specifics
indicating
that
there
was
such
an
agreement
as
opposed
to
lawyer
speculation
and
a
desire
to
engage
in
expensive
discovery
they
would
have
produced
that.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well
again
the
whole
way
this
was
litigated
below
by
the
plaintiffs
was
that
they,
they
acknowledged
they
had
no
specifics.
they
simply
asked
that
an
inference
be
drawn
from
the
parallel
conduct
they
alleged.
and
that
is
our
central
point
that
you
simply
cannot
infer
an
agreement
from
this
conduct.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you.
your
honor.
i
have
three
quick
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
point,
the
private
plaintiffs
do
not
have
an
authority
to
issue
purely
investigative
complaints.
the
department
of
justice
of
course
can
issue
civil
investigative
demands,
but
for
private
plaintiffs
the
price
of
admission
even
to
discovery,
particularly
to
the
sort
of
massive
discovery
at
issue
here,
is
to
establish
some
basis
for
thinking
the
plaintiff...
the
defendants
have
done
something
wrong.
in
that
regard,
in
the
trinko
case,
the
plaintiffs
there
specifically
alleged
that
the
defendants
were
engaged
in
actions
against
self
interest
by
not
cooperating
with
new
entrants.
and
what
the
court
did
is
it
went
behind
that
mere
allegation,
looked
at
the
complaint,
looked
at
facts
concerning
the
industry,
looked
at
the
statute,
regulatory
rulings
and
said
that's
ridiculous.
of
course
it
is
in
the
self
interest
of
the
incumbents
to
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
cooperate
with
new
entrants
to
allow
them
to
take
business
away.
now
the
flip
side,
the
second
half
of
the
conspiracy
that
the
plaintiffs
alleged
here
is
our
failure
to
enter
new
markets.
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
they
are
suggesting
we
should
have
relied
upon
a
regulatory
regime
that
we
were
successfully
challenging
in
the
courts.
we
got
it
struck
down
three
separate
times,
and
it
was
simply
not
a
viable
business
opportunity
in
light
of
those
facts
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suggest
that
it
was
anything
but
in
the
self
interest
of
the
defendants
to
decline
to
enter
these
markets.
even
conscious
parallelism
is
not
sufficient
to
state
a
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws.
and
at
best,
that
is
what
we
have
here,
and
as
a
consequence
they
failed
to
state
a
claim.
if
the
court
has
further
questions?
i
have
nothing
further.
