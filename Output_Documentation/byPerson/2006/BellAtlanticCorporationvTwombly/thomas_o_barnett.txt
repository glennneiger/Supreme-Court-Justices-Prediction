mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
concern
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
can
be
read
to
hold
that
a
section
1
sherman
act
complaint
will
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
merely
by
alleging
parallel
action
or
inaction
in
attaching
the
bare
assertion
of
an
agreement.
such
a
result
fails
to
appreciate
that
parallel
action
or
inaction
is
ubiquitous
in
our
economy
and
often
reflects
beneficial
competitive
forces.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
well
there
are
certain
portions
of
the
decision
that
talk
about
a
plausibility
requirement
but
when
it
turns
to
the
specific
area
of
a
section
1
complaint
and
a
complaint
alleged
on
parallel
conduct,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
that's
the
only
interpretation
i
can
draw
from
that
passage.
the
court
held
that
if
you
allege
parallel
action
unless
there
are
no
set
of
facts
that
can
be
proved,
and
it's
always
possible
to
hypothesize
an
agreement,
you
cannot
dismiss
that
complaint.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
well,
justice
souter,
i
read
that
passage
of
the
second
circuit
decision
as
not
expressly
referencing
the
plausibility
requirement.
there
is
language
saying
that
the
allegation
needs
to
be
plausible
but
when
you
get
to
this
specific
passage
it
says
that
if
you
allege
parallel
conduct
a
court
cannot
dismiss
the
claim
unless
there
could
be
no
set
of
facts
that
could
be
proved.
but
regardless,
even
if
i
am,
your
interpretation
is
potentially
permissible
interpretation,
the
fundamental
concern
of
the
united
states
is
that
this
court,
having
the
case
now,
clarify
that
a
section
1
sherman
act
complaint
should
not
be
able
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
unless
it
alleges
some
facts
beyond
mere
generic
parallel
action.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
well,
we
prefer
the
formulation
that,
from
the
court's
opinion
in
dura
that
says
that
the
facts
need
to
demonstrate
some
reasonably
founded
expectation
that
there
is
an
unlawful
agreement
within
the
meaning
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
that
is
correct.
if
all
you
know
is
that
there
is
parallel
action
or
inaction,
that
in
and
of
itself
tells
you
nothing.
once
you
start
to
add
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
it,
particular
parallel
action
can
be
suspicious
enough,
and
the
example
you
give
is
a
good
one,
that
demonstrates
a
reasonably
founded
expectation
for
believing
that
discovery
may
yield
evidence
showing
that
that
parallel
price
increase
at
the
same
time
by
nine
different
companies
was
the
result
of
an
unlawful
conspiracy.
if
i
can
turn
to,
in...
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
reasonably
founded
expectation,
you
do
need
to
look
to
the
substantive
law.
here
the
issue
is
the
law
on
agreement
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
some
of
the
questions
i
think
i've
heard
go
to
this
issue.
section
1
law
specifically
limits
the
kinds
of
facts
that
can
be
used
to
establish
an
agreement
that
is
cognizable
under
the
sherman
act.
in
particular,
the
court's
rulings
made
clear
that
conscious
parallelism
which
some
economists
might
argue
is
a
form
of
an
agreement,
is
not
an
agreement
within
the
meaning
of
section
1.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
it
may
be
admissible
evidence
but
depending
on
the
facts
and
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--no.
it
should
fail
if
it
fail...
if
it
does
not
allege
facts
that
indicate
reasonable
found--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--it
is
a
combined
question
of
law
and
fact
in
our
view,
because
as
i
said
the
section
1
law
limits
the
kinds
of
facts
that
can
be
used
to
establish
an
agreement.
if
all
they
have
alleged
is
parallel
action
without
more--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--but
as
paragraph
51
of
the
complaint
is,
as
you
were
discussing,
in
some
ways
even
worse.
because
it
specifically
relies
upon
parallel
action
and
alleged
parallel
inaction.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
and
that
is
not
sufficient
because
in
our
view
the
complaint
needs
to
allege
some
facts
that
demonstrate
a
basis
for
believing
there
was
an
unlawful
agreement
within--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--no.
every
business,
every
day
fails
to
enter
some
new
line
of
business
or
take
some
potential
competitive
action.
the
mere--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--no.
i
would,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
there
still
needs
in
our
view
to
be
some
allegation
that
indicates...
a
factual
allegation
that
indicates
a
reason
for
believing
there
may
have
been
unlawful
agreement.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
that
may
be
sufficient
because
it
is
providing
enough
facts
to
give
you
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
basis
for--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--well,
and
it...
you...
you--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--it
needs
to
allege
enough
specifics--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--i
want
to
be
clear--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--the
facts
allege
need
to
be
specific
enough
to
suggest--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
in
my
view
that's
probably
insufficient--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--i
believe
that
this
court's
decision
in
dura
pharmaceutical--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--you
did--
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
--i
thought
our
brief
lists
cases
that
go
to
that
point.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
well,
it
does
provide
notice
that...
this
is
a
fairly
low
threshold.
it
provides
some
indication.
it
can
be
an
indication
of
direct
evidence.
it
can
be
an
indication
of
circumstantial
evidence.
it
does
focus
the
litigation,
however,
by
providing
a,
a
reason
why
the
court
and
the
defendant
should
be
defending
themselves
against
a
section
1
claim.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
thomas
o.
barnett
surely
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
facts
under
which
they
would
not
have
not
conspired
and
they
would
have
had
a
different
motive,
but
that's
not
the
legal
standard
under
conley
versus
gibson.
