mr.
kellogg,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
assiduously
avoid
using
the
word
fact
throughout.
and
from
1938
on,
it
has
been
repeated
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
plead
facts.
the
index
of
forms,
the
appendix
of
forms
shows
how
simple
the
plain
statement
of
a
claim
is,
and
you're
not
required
to
plead
facts.
and
yet
that's
the
central...
seems
to
be
the
central
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
negligently
drove.
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
went
through
a
stop
light.
doesn't
say
whether
it
was
speeding.
it
doesn't
say
any
one
of
the
umpteen
ways
one
could
be
negligent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
a
summary
judgment
case
and
hadn't
there
been
discovery
before?
the
matsushita
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
acting
in
self
interest.
i
mean,
they
might
just
decide
apart
from,
you
know,
if
they
go
into
their
territory
they'll
come
into
mine,
that
investing
in
this
wired
business
isn't
the
best,
the
best
bet
for
them.
maybe
they
want
to
get
into
the
wireless
business
and
think
that's
a
better
way
to
spend
their
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
questioning
you.
you
say
you
meet
the
plus
factor
because
they
were
acting
against
their
self-interest,
that
a
self-interested
player
in
this
league
would
have
gone
into
the
other's
territory,
and
i'm
questioning
that
by
saying
that
they
might
have
seen
this
whole
area
as
not
the
best
place
to
invest
their
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
richards,
didn't
the
second
circuit
say
you
don't
need
a
plus
factor?
they
said
if
you
did,
we
think
that
the
plaintiffs
could
show
it,
but
the
second
sentence
is
you
don't
need
a
plus
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
can
be
wrong
or
right,
but
the
second
circuit
was
very
clear
that
rule
8
wants
a
plain
statement
of
the
claim
and
no
plus
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
contains
a
time
and
a
place.
it's
quite
specific
that
there
was
an
accident
and
that
defendant,
defendant
of
a
certain
name
at
a
certain
time
and
place
negligently
drove.
what
it
doesn't
tell
you
is
the
details
of
the,
of
what
was
negligent,
but
it
certainly
is
specific
in
time
and
place
and
person,
which
is
one
of
the...
one
of
the
concerns,
i
mean,
if
you
strip
away
everything,
it
seems
that
you
have
a
suspicion
that
there
may
have
been
a
conspiracy
and
you
want
to
use
a
discovery
process
to
find
out
whether
or
not
that's
true.
isn't
that
essentially
what
this
complaint
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
does
it
get
characterized
as
a
class
action,
before
this
discovery
or
after?
