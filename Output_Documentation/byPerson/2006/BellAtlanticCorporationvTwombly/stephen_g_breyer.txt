justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
do
have
a
case...
anywhere,
forget
antitrust.
suppose
it's
a
tort
case,
and
the
following
complaint
is
filed.
my
foot
hurts.
i've
gone
to
dr.
smith
for
15
years.
i
claim
he
is
negligent.
is
that
valid?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
you
think
that's
valid,
i
understand
that
you
think
this
complaint
does
just
what
i
said
in
the
field
of
antitrust.
but
is
there
any
case
that
you've
come
across
which
would
say
a
complaint
just
as
i
have
described
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--either
is
valid
or
is
not
valid.
you'd
like
to
find
one
that
says
it's
not
valid,
so
what's
your
best
effort
in
any
field
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
get
into
trouble
by
alleging
too
much,
i
guess,
because
if
you
allege
a
lot,
you
might
leave
something
out.
and
you
say,
well,
what
about
that
one.
but
suppose
we
keep
it
very,
very
minimal.
and
a
person
just
says,
i'm
hurt
and
the
defendant,
i
claim,
negligently
injured
me.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
only
thing
that's
missing
there
are
some
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
you're
saying
a
complaint
has
to
have
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you're,
that's
the
part
precisely
which
you're
following
that
i
don't,
that
i
actually
don't
know,
is
the
extent
to
which
you
have
to
put
in
a
complaint,
in
whatever
field
of
law,
you
can
allege
a
fact.
you
say
the
person
ran
over
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
you
say,
they
treated
me
negligently.
that's
a
fact.
that
means
something
happened
there.
but
suppose
you
write
the
complaint
and
there
is
just
no
notion
that
you
have
a
what
and
when,
how,
under
what
circumstances.
it's
just
totally
out
of
thin
air,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
know
what,
what
period
of
time
he
is
supposed
to
be
thinking
about,
what,
what
happens
to
such
a
complaint?
there
must
be
some
law
on
it
in
torts
or
someplace?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
couldn't
you
do
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
they're...
they're
using
the
fact
that
there
was
parallel
behavior
as
a
basis
for
thinking
there
was
more
than
parallel
behavior.
they
are
using
it
as
a
basis
for
thinking
that
once,
on
some
occasion
that's
relevant,
there
were
people
meeting
in
a
room
and
saying
things
to
each
other.
so
they
are
not
just
saying
that
it's
sufficient.
they
are
saying
it's
evidence
that
something
else
occurred.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
say
on
the
14th
of
january,
2004,
we
believe
that
in
the
city
of
new
york,
they
agreed
upon
this
course
of
action?
that
would
surely
be
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
saying,
all
i've
done
is
limited
it
in
time
and
space.
just
as
you
might
say
on
october
the
24th,
2004
at
the
corner
of
14th
and
third
avenue,
defendant
drove
negligently
and
injured
me.
that's
certainly
a
complaint,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
look,
the
one
i
just
alleged
in
the
tort
law
is
a
complaint.
i've
just
copied
it
out
of
the
model
complaints.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
understand
the
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
how
to
apply
the
standard
and
now
i
take
my
tort
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
okay,
and
now
i
say
sometime
during
the
last
10
years
he
drove
negligently
and
injured
me.
is
that
no
good?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
you're
saying
that
this
case
is
like
that,
when
because
they
don't
say
when
they
met,
they
don't
say
what
happened,
they
don't
give
a
time
or
place.
if
that's,
leaving
your
side
parallelism
out
of
it,
i'm
past
you
on
that,
all
right?
i'll
accept
for
argument's
sake
all
your
point
about
that.
now
if
you're
saying
this
is
too
vague,
leaving
that
out
of
it,
because
it
doesn't
say
time
and
place
of
the
meetings
or
give
any
other
clue
for
meetings
etcetera,
what's
your
best
authority?
this
is
an
area
of
law
i'm
not
familiar
with.
i'm
looking
for
cases
that
will
tell
me
how
specific
a
complaint
has
to
be
to
tie
the
events
down
to
specific
ones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
dura
is
still
the
best.
i
think
i,
did
i
write
that
case?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
drawing
total
comfort
from
it.
[laughter]
in
fact
i'd
like
something
in
tort
law
or
something
that,
you
know,
that
i
get
a
general
idea
of
what
the
law
is
because
i
don't
know
that
antitrust
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
my
case,
the
gasoline,
oil
prices
fell,
but
i
happen
to
know
there
were
four
gasoline
shops
near
each
other,
gasoline
stations,
and
they
didn't
cut
their
prices.
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
that's
the
economy,
and
you
can
go
sue
half
the
firms
in
this
economy.
every
firm
in
a
concentrated
industry
engages
in...
i
mean,
normally
conscious
parallelism,
and
i
know
there
are
economists
who
think
that
that
should
be
the
case,
but
i
thought
the
law
to
date
was
that
the
department
of
justice
is
not
given
by
the
sherman
act
the
authority
to
remake
the
entire
american
economy.
but
if
we
accept
your
view
i
guess
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ordinarily,
if
you
take
that
sentence
and
read
it
for
how
you're
reading,
a
consciously
parallel
action
is
a
violation
of
sherman
act
section
2,
then
we
have
that
radical
change
that
many
have
advocated
for
the
last
40
or
50
years,
that
half
the
economy
is
in
violation,
because
in
any
concentrated
industry,
after
all,
it
is
in
the
interest
of
a
firm
to
cut
prices
and
to
make
a
large
market
unless
he
knows
his
three
competitors
will
also
keep
prices
up.
now,
you
have
to
know
that
or
you'd
cut
them.
and
that's
called
conscious
parallelism.
and
i
had
always
thought
that
this
court
had
not
said
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
if
in
fact
all
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
bring
a
price-fixing
case
and
get
into
discovery
is
to
allege
conscious
parallelism
and
then
add
without
further
foundation,
and
we
think
there
was
a
real
agreement
too,
but
there's
nothing
other
than
the
conscious
parallelism
to
back
it
up,
now
we've
got
just
what
i
said,
with
the
exception
you
might
not
win
at
the
end
of
the
day.
what
have
you
is
a
ticket
to
conduct
discovery.
now,
that's
what's
bothering
the
department
of
justice
and
so
i'd
like
to
know
the
answer
to
that
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
also
like
a
clear
answer,
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
because
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
thinking
there.
we
have
three
steel
sheet
companies
in
the
united
states,
no
more.
they
sell
at
$10
a
sheet.
one
day
we
have
action
in
the
case,
a
memo
to
the
president
of
the
company.
he
says
mr.
president,
if
you
cut
your
prices
to
$7
you
will
make
even
more
money
unless
the
others
go
along.
and
if
they
get
there
first,
you
will
lose
money.
so
whether
they
cut
or
not,
you'd
better
cut
your
prices.
reply
from
the
president:
but
if
i
don't
cut
my
prices,
they
won't
cut
theirs,
and
we
are
all
better
off.
that's
your
evidence.
do
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
depend.
that's
the
evidence.
do
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
you
cite
matsushita
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
right,
then
i
guess
we
could
engage
in
this
major
restructuring
of
the
economy,
and
if
that's
the
law,
i'm
surprised
they
haven't
done
it,
but
maybe
they
have
just
been
recalcitrant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
because
we
have
concentrated
industries
throughout
the
economy,
i
guess,
or
at
least
we
used
to,
and
i
suppose
that
that's
a
perfectly
valid
way
of
reasoning
for
an
executive
in
such
a
company,
at
least
they
teach
that
at
the
schools
of
government,
and
people
who
aren't
really
experienced
in
these
things,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay,
fine.
now,
let's
forget
my
immediate
disagreement
or
not.
let's
say
i
agree
with
you
on
this.
now
we
have
our
example
right
in
mind.
what
other
than
the
parallel
to
my
example
could
one
reading
this
complaint
think
you
intend
to
prove?
