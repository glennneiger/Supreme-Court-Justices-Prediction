justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
you
were
also
making
a
different
argument.
i
thought
you
were
making
the
argument
that
they
have,
by
their
pleadings,
in
effect,
affirmatively
indicated
that
they
don't
have
enough
facts
to
support
a
general
allegation.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
because
of
the
preface
that
you
began
reading,
that
in
view
simply
of
the
fact
that
they
are
not
competing,
and
in
view
of
parallel
conduct,
they
have
violated
the
act.
so
i
guess
my
question
is,
would
your
position
be
different
if
there
were
no
allegation
simply
of
an
absence
of
competition
and
parallel
action
if...
would
your
position
be
different
if
they
had
simply
alleged,
as
justice
stevens
emphasized,
that
here
were
these
parties
and
they
had...
they
had
taken
some
action,
not
specified,
which
resulted
in
violation
of
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
would
not
be
good
enough,
but
are
you
saying
that
this
is
worse
because,
in
effect,
they
have
gone
some
steps
towards
specification.
and
the
specifications
that
they
have
made
affirmatively
show
that
they
don't
have
enough
for
the
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
inference
cannot
be
drawn
from
the
particular
facts
that
they
have
alleged.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
really
what
they...
i
thought,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
the,
that
the
court
spoke
of
no
set
of
facts,
only
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
a
pleading
which
did
raise
a
plausible,
possible
inference
of
forbidden
conduct,
and
i
thought
the
court
was
saying
if
the,
if
the
plausibility
criterion
has
been
satisfied,
then
the
only
way
that
the
defendant
can
get
a
dismissal
is
by
showing
that
there
is
no
set
of
facts
which
would
actually
support
the
action.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
can
be
done
at
the,
at
the,
at
the
stage
of
simply
pleading
a
dismissal
as
opposed
to
summary
judgment
or
something
like
that.
but
i
thought
the
court
did
not
get
to
its
no
set
of
facts
point
until
it
had
first
assumed
that
there
had
been
a,
a
pleading
on
the
basis
of
which
a
plausible
inference
of
forbidden
conduct
could
be
drawn.
am
i
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
so
that
if
plausibility
is
the
standard
this
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
plausibility,
that's
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does
not
help
you
with
respect
to
the
other
claim,
the
claim
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
prevent
upstart
competitors
from
coming
in.
there's
no
plus
factor
as
i
understand
it
alleged
there,
and
i
also
understand
that
it
would
have
been
entirely
in
the
interest
of
each
of
your
defendants
to
keep
the
upstarts
out
and
that
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
agree
to
do
that.
it
would
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
do
it.
what
do
you
say
about
that
part
of
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
a
common,
isn't
the
common
motive
consistent,
just
as
consistent
with
no
agreement
as
with
agreement?
in
other
words,
they
didn't
have
to
agree;
their
common
motive
was
operative
agreement
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
what
the
other
side
is
saying
is
that
simply
by
alleging
parallelism
when
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
each
of
the
alleged
conspirators
to
do
just
as
you
claim
they
are
doing
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement,
you
have
not
alleged
something
that
gets
to
the
threshold
of
plausibility.
that's
their
argument
and
i,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
may
reply
to
us
jointly
or
severally,
however
you
may
want.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
is
that
the
allegation
with
respect
to
the
agreement
to
procure
the
getaway
cars
gets
to
a
kind
of
specificity
that
is
not
present
here.
here
the
allegation
simply
is
parallel
conduct
to
make
it
hard
for
the
upstarts
to
get
in.
and
at
that
general
level
the
answer
is,
of
course
anyone
in
his
right
mind
would
want
to
make
it
difficult
to
let
the
upstarts
in.
there's
no
need
to
assume
that
they
might
have
agreed
on
some
matter
of
detail
which
is
not
essential
to
the
scheme.
this
is
a
general
characteristic
of
competition
and
resistance
of
competition.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
don't
do
that,
is
it
your
argument
that
simply
by
behaving
differently
from
the
way
congress
assumed
when
it
passed
the
statute,
that
raises
the
plausible
inference
of
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
is
part
of
the
plausibility
of
that
inference
the
fact,
in
your
argument,
the
fact
that
congress
assumed
that
would
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
the
congressional
assumption
is
part
of
your
case,
in
other
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
1984
divestiture
of
at&t’s
local
telephone
business
produced
a
system
of
regional
service
monopolies
called
incumbent
local
exchange
carries
or
ilecs.
a
decade
later
congress
passed
the
telecommunications
act
1996
which
sought
to
promote
competition
within
the
telecommunications
industry
by
requiring
each
ilec
to
share
its
network
elements
at
wholesale
prices
with
its
competitors,
so
called
“competitive
local
exchange
carriers”
or
clecs.
respondent
william
twombly
and
lawrence
marcus,
whom
i
will
call
plaintiffs,
represent
a
class
of
subscribers
to
local
telephone
and
high
speed
internet
services
in
this
action
against
the
petitioner
ilecs
for
claim
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
which
prohibits
every
contract,
combination
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
or
commerce.
the
compliant
alleges
that
the
ilecs
conspired
to
restrain
in
trade
as
shown
by
two
sets
of
facts,
first,
by
engaging
in
parallel
conduct
in
their
respective
service
areas
to
inhibit
the
growth
of
upstart
clecs
and
second
by
the
parallel
action
of
refraining
from
pursuing
business
opportunity,
in
competition
against
each
other.
the
district
court
dismissed
plaintiff’s
complaint
under
rule
12(b)(6)
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
complaint
adequately
stated
claim
because
the
ilecs
failed
to
show
that
there
is
no
set
of
facts
under
which
plaintiffs
could
demonstrate
that
the
parallel
conduct
asserted
was
the
product
of
collision.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse.
in
the
sherman
act
section
1
context
we
upheld
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
survive
summary
judgment
without
showing
something
more
than
mere
parallel
business
conduct
to
distinguish
conspiracy
from
perfectly
legitimate
business
activity
and
the
plaintiff
must
offer
some
proof
tending
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
each
of
the
defendants
was
simply
acting
unilaterally
in
response
to
common
market
perceptions.
in
this
case
we
consider
the
antecedent
question
of
what
a
plaintiff
must
plead
in
order
to
state
the
section
1
claim.
in
light
of
the
plaintiff’s
obligation
to
provide
the
grounds
of
his
entitlement
to
relief
in
the
pleadings,
we
hold
that
stating
a
section
1
claim
requires
a
complaint
with
enough
factual
matter
to
suggest
that
an
agreement
was
made.
the
need
at
the
pleading
stage
for
allegation
suggesting
not
merely
consistent
with
conspiracy,
not
only
fall
us
from
the
language
of
rule
882
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
but
also
serves
the
practical
purpose
of
avoiding
the
unnecessary
expense
of
discovery
in
cases
where
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
that
discovery
will
reveal
evidence
of
any
legal
agreement.
in
some,
when
allegations
of
parallel
conduct
are
setout
in
order
to
make
out
a
section
1
claim
they
must
be
placed
in
a
context
that
suggests
a
preceding
agreement
as
distinct
from
identical
independent
action.
applying
the
standard
to
the
plaintiff’s
compliant
here;
we
conclude
that
the
section
1
claim
comes
up
short.
as
to
the
ilecs
supposed
agreement
to
disobey
the
1996
act
and
thwart
the
clecs
attempt
to
compete,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
nothing
in
the
complaint
suggest
that
the
resistance
to
clecs
was
anything
more
than
the
natural
unilateral
reaction
of
each
ilec
intend
on
keeping
its
regional
dominance.
likewise,
the
complaint
provides
no
indication
that
the
lack
of
competition
among
the
ilecs
is
the
product
of
any
illegal
agreement
rather
than
the
aftereffect
of
a
market
historically
characterized
by
monopoly
in
geographic
segmentation.
not
withstanding
congress’
high
hopes
for
greater
competition,
there
remain
many
disincentives
to
entering
new
markets
in
telecommunications
and
ilecs
inaction
in
this
respect
fails
to
suggest
conspiracy.
because
the
plaintiffs
here
have
not
nudged
their
conspiracy
claim
across
the
line
from
conceivable
to
plausible
we
hold
that
their
complaint
must
be
dismissed
and
we
remand
it
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
