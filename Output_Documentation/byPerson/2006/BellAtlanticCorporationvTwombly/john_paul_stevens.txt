justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
isn't
the
next
sentence,
the
substance
of
the
sentence
is
"plaintiffs
allege
upon
information
and
belief
that
defendants
have
entered
into
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
to
prevent
competitive
entry
in
their
respective
telephone
and/or
high
speed
interstate
markets,
and
agreed
not
to
compete
with
one
another
and
otherwise
allocated
customers
and
markets
to
one
another.
"
now,
does
that
state
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you
could
leave
out
everything
before
plaintiff,
the
part
you
quoted,
that's
not
part
of
the
declaration
in
the
sentence.
but
the
sentence
itself
alleges
a
garden
variety
of
the
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
got
the
language
of
the
sherman
act,
a
conspiracy
to
prevent
competitive
entry
in
their
respective
telephone
and/or
high
speed
markets.
that's
not
in
the
sherman
act,
that's
a
description
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
kellogg,
that's
not
a
legal
conclusion,
it's
an
allegation
of
fact
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
prevent
competitive
entry
into
respective
markets.
there
are
dozens
of
antitrust
complaints
that
are
no
more
specific
than
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
may
be
true
on
summary
judgment,
you
may
be
dead
right
on
the
merits,
but
are
you
telling
me
that
an
allegation
that
the
defendants
have
agreed
not
to
compete
with
one
another
is
not
a
statement
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
they
said
they
agreed
in
writing
not
to
compete
with
one
another,
would
that
be
sufficient?
or
if
they
have
agreed
orally
not
to
compete
with
one
another,
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
said
they
have
agreed
orally
not
to
compete
with
one
another,
would
that
be
a
statement
of
fact,
an
allegation
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
did
you
leave
the
words
orally
out?
why
is
it
not
a
statement,
allegation
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
direct
allegation
of
conspiracy,
that
very
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
make
it
fairly
clear
that
they
may
only
have
the
evidence
of
parallel
conduct
that
you
describe,
and
that
may
not
be
sufficient,
and
maybe
for
that
reason,
you
get
a
summary
judgment.
but
how
you
can
say
this
is
not
an
allegation
of
fact,
i
find
mind-boggling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
clear
it's
not
sufficient
to
prove
it,
but
is
it
admissible
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
a
plaintiffs's
complaint
fail
because
it
includes
unnecessary,
verbose,
admissible
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
not
it
an
allegation
that
they've
agreed
not
to
compete
with
one
another
an
allegation
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
alleged
more.
they
have
alleged
an
actual
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
complaint
in
addition
to
that
alleged
that
up
to
a
certain
date,
it
was
unlawful
for
the
companies
to
compete
with
one
another
but
the
law
was
changed
and
after
that
change
took
place
they
were
advised
by
their
lawyers
they
could
compete,
but
they
agreed
not
to.
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
richards,
can
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
that
you
were
allowed
to
have
discovery
and
each
chief
executive
of
the
defendant
companies
got
on
the
stand
and
said:
i
never
talked
to
my,
my
competitors
at
all,
i
never
seriously
considered
competing
in
the
other,
other
company's
territory
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the,
in
your
opponent's
brief
on
the
merits
here.
we
never
did
agree.
and
you're
able
to
prove
the
things
you've
alleged
in
the
agreement.
would
the,
would
it
be
appropriate
to
enter
summary
judgment
against
you
on
that
testimony
if
you
had
no
evidence
of
a
specific
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
question
is
you
can
prove
what
you've
now
alleged
factually,
but
they
deny
the
existence
of
any
agreement
and
they
explained
the
reasons
for
it
exactly
as
the
lawyers
did
in
this
brief.
would
you
not
lose
on
summary
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
prove
what
you
have
alleged,
in
effect,
except
for
the
key
allegation
of
agreement
among
the
competitors.
if
you
had
no
other
evidence
of
that
agreement,
would
you
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
alleged
something
is
against
their
self-interest
is
enough
to
make
an
issue
of
fact
on
whether
it's
against
their
self-interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
have
gone
on
the
stand,
they
gave
all
the
reasons
in
the
red
briefs...
or
the
blue
briefs
in
this
case,
that
say
it's
not
against
their
self-interest;
you'd
say
that
would
be
a
jury
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
you
don't
have
to
prove
an
actual
agreement?
you
can
merely
prove
conduct
contrary
to
self-interest
is
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
you
must...
do
you
agree
that
you
must
prove
an
actual
agreement
among
the
defendants?
