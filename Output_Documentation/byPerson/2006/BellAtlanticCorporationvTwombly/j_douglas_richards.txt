mr.
j.
douglas
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
essential
dimensions
to
the
problem
that's
before
the
court
and
on
every
one
of
those
dimensions
the
guidance
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
in
its
amicus
brief
in
the
swierkiewicz
case
is
180
degrees
opposite
the
guidance
that
the
solicitor
general
is
providing
in
its
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
the
first
of
those
dimensions
i'll
begin
with
because
it's
where
petitioners
began.
in
their
brief,
the
solicitor
general
in
the
swierkiewicz
case
very
clearly
said
that
evidentiary
standards
cannot
be
made
into
pleading
standards.
what
they
said
on
page
5
was
that
by
requiring
pleading
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
prima
facie
case
from
employment
law
the
second
circuit
had
erroneously
conflated
the
fair
notice
owed
the
defendant
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
with
the
standards
governing
the
plaintiff's
present
of
proof
in
court.
later
at
page
11,
they
said
the
court's
test
confuses
pleading--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--from
the
swierkiewicz
solicitor
general
brief.
they
said
that
the
court
test
in
the
second
circuit
that
was
reversed--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--there's
a
big
difference
between...
the
answer
is
i
don't
know,
perhaps.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
perhaps.
but
that's
very
different
from
this
case
and
it's
different
in
that
an
automobile
accident
is
something
that
happens
all
in
one
moment
in
time.
an
antitrust
conspiracy
like
the
conspiracy
alleged--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--oh,
it
could
happen
in
many
moments.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
but
what
the
second
circuit
said
on
this
point,
and
i
submit
that
the
second
circuit
was
correct,
was
that
the
complaint
does
set
forth
the
temporal
and
geographic
parameters
of
the
alleged
illegal
activity
and
the
identities
of
the
alleged
key
participants,
and
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
it
alleges--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--it
alleges
that
there
was
an
agreement,
but
it
doesn't
prove
that
there
was
an
agreement
because
proving
the
facts
alleged
is
not
a
plaintiff's
burden
in
the
complaint.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
yes.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
the
leading
plus
factor
that's
generally
used
in,
in
the
matsushita
context,
in
the
monsanto
context,
is
action
that
would
have
been
against
the
self-interest
of
the
conspirators
in
the
absence
of
a
conspiracy,
and
this
complaint
alleges
very
clearly
that
the
conduct
of
not
entering
into
one
another's
territories
and
competing
among
the
ilecs
as
a
clec
was
contrary
to
what
would
have
been--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
that
conspiracy
were
implausible,
if
it
made
no
sense.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
right,
but
the
second
circuit
standard
and
the
standard
we
defend
is
that
if
someone
alleges
a
conspiracy
i
that
just
makes
no
sense
because
it's
obvious
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
the
alleged
conspirators
aren't
in
the
same
product
market,
not
in
the
same
geographic
market
or
something
of
that
kind,
there
is
no
conceivable
motive
for
them
to
enter
into
the
kind
of
conspiracy
at
hand,
the
complaint
can
be
dismissed.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
yes.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
justice
breyer,
in
the
nhl
case,
the
national
hockey
league
case,
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
the
petitioners
relied
upon
for
a
circuit
conflict
to
get
here,
what
the
court
said
is
that
allegations
that
defendant's
action
taken
independently
would
be
contrary
to
their
economic
self-interest
will
ordinarily
tend
to
exclude
the
likelihood--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--well,
justice
breyer,
we
don't
just
allege
conscious
parallelism.
we
allege--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
difference
between
that,
a
critical
difference
between
that
scenario
and
what
we
have
alleged
in
this
complaint
is
that
we
do
allege
in
great
detail
that
not
entering
into
one
another's
territories
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
interests
of--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case,
paragraph
50
does
allege
two
plus
factors,
but
they
are
essentially
allegations
of
common
motive,
which
is
a
less
strong,
i'll
grant
you--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--the
important
thing
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
is
the
continental
case
in
this
court,
which
said
that
you're
not
supposed
to
dismember...
it's
an
inappropriate
way
to
approach
a
conspiracy
to
dismember
it,
look
at
one
piece
of
it
in
isolation,
evaluate
it
as
though
it's
by
itself
and
then
wipe
the
slate
clean
at
the
end
of
that
analysis,
and
that's
essentially
what
the
other
side
is
trying
to
do
repeatedly.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
if
i
may,
i'll
try
to
pose
a
hypothetical
that
i
think
addresses
justice
souter's
question
and
then,
justice
scalia,
i'll
try
to
address
your
question.
justice
souter,
a
good
example
would
be
suppose
one
alleges
a
conspiracy
to
rob
a
bank
and
to
steal
a
number
of
getaway
cars
at
the
same
time
and
one
comes...
in
order
to
get
away,
so
that
the
conspirators
couldn't
be
found
at
the
site
of
robbing
the
bank.
one
could
say,
well,
there's
a
reason
to
rob
the
getaway
cars
totally
independent
of
the
bank
and
without
a
conspiracy.
why
do
they
need
a
conspiracy
to
steal
a
car?
why
isn't
that
something
that
they
wouldn't
individually
do?
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
i
understand,
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
with
the
hypothetical
is
that
what
one
does
if
one
is
just
looking
at
the
conspiracy
to
keep
clecs
out
by
itself
first,
taking
the
secondary
aspect
of
the
conspiracy,
putting
it
first
and
analyzing
it
in
isolation,
is
like
taking
the
getaway
car
theft,
analyzing
it
in
isolation,
saying,
well,
they
have
a
reason
individually
to
steal
the
cars,
so
i
guess
that
couldn't--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--in
the
context
of
summary
judgment
or
at
trial,
we
would
be
required
to
prove
what
we
have
now
alleged.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
if
we
don't
have
proof
at
that
point
of
what
we've
alleged
here,
we'd
lose--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
we
had
proof
that
they
actually
acted
against
what
would
have
been
their
self-interest
in
the
absence
of
a
conspiracy,
we
would
satisfy
then
the
matsushita
standard
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
i
understand
that.
but
we
have
alleged
that
as
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
fact
and
that
allegation
has
to
be
treated
as
true
under
conventional
pleading
standards
for
purposes
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
we
are
unable
to
prove
that
fact
when
we
get
to
summary
judgment--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--yes,
yes.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
no,
not
at
summary
judgment.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
at
the
pleading
stage
to
allege
that,
which
is
an
allegation
of
fact,
satisfies
pleading
standards.
just
to
allege
it
with
testimony
on
the
other
side
and
no
evidence
to
prove
that
allegation
on
summary
judgment--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--conduct
contrary
to
self-interest
is
a
way
of
inferring
actual
agreement
in
the
absence
of
direct
evidence.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
there
must
be
an
inference
of
actual
agreement,
but
the
inference
can
be
drawn
from
circumstantial
evidence,
and
that's
what
matsushita
is
all
about.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
counsel
presented
it
as
though
it's
a
complete
summary
of
everything,
but
what
it
says
is,
and
the
other
facts
and
market
circumstances
alleged
above,
and
it's
preceded
by--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--correct.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
it's
also
an
independent
statement
and
allegation
on
information
and
belief,
which
is
permitted
under
rule
8,
that
there
is
agreement.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
if
you
gave
no
context
of
what
kind
of
a
conspiracy
you
were
alleging
and
what
kind
of
scope
it
had,
so
that
a
court
could
balance--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
there
isn't
enough
in
the
way
of
facts
alleged
to
permit
a
court
to
understand
what
it
is
you're
claiming
in
general
terms
happening,
then
you
haven't
satisfied
rule
8.
i
mean--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--well,
in
this
case
we
have
provided,
as
the
second
circuit--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--in
this
case
with
the
allegations
of
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
that
precede
that
sentence,
it's
enough.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
that
sentence
by
itself--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--i
think
that
that
would
satisfy
conventional
pleading
standards
under
rule
8(a).
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
it
would
satisfy
the
second
circuit's
standard
below,
because
the
second
circuit
required
enough
facts
to
enable
a
court
to
wrap
its
mind
around
a
complainant,
understanding
what
it
is
you
claimed
happened.
you
don't
have
to
prove
your
case
as
a
complainant,
you
just
have
to--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--that
would
depend
on
the
vehicle--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
that's
the
evidence,
i
think
i
win.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
no.
for
that
i
would
cite
judge
posner's
decision.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
there's
no
major
restructuring
of
the--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--well,
the
way
judge
posner
explains
it
in
high
fructose
is
to
say
that
it
is
possible
to
have
an
agreement
without
a
moment
where
there's
a
statement
of
agreement.
the
participants
in
a
conspiracy
can
possibly
treat
what
one
of
them
does
as
an
offer,
which
another
one
can
accept
by
following
it,
to
satisfy
that
way
of
showing
a
conspiracy.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
your
honor,
the
strongest...
plus
factors
that,
in
the
absence
of
direct
evidence
of
conspiracy
at
the
outset
of
a
case,
which
private
plaintiffs
will
almost
never
have
because
people
don't
conspire
in
public
parks.
all
a
plaintiff
can
have
is
what
are
called
plus
factors
under
matsushita,
and
the
strongest
of
those
plus
factors
is
what
has
been
alleged
in
great
detail
in
this
complaint
of
action
against
self
interest.
the
case
law
recognizes
that--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--this
is
different
from
that
because
this
is
a
situation
where
when
the
telecommunications
act
was
passed
in
1996,
congress
expected
that
the
ilecs
would
compete
in
one
another's
territories
as
clecs.
the
defendants
pledged
that
they
would
compete
in
one
another's
territories
at
ilecs.
they
then
for
years
in
congress
complained
that
the
clecs
who
were
trying
to
compete
with
them
were
given
an
unfair
advantage
in
the
terms
and
conditions
on
which
they
were
permitted
to--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
they
can
prove
that
that's
the
reason
why
they
didn't
jump
in
and
compete,
then
they
have
a
nonconspiratorial
reason
for
what
they
did.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
within
the
other
facts
that
i
was
identifying,
there
is
a
strong
suggestion
here
that
competition
as
a
clec
would
have
been,
in
the
absence
of
the
pattern
of
conduct
that
we
allege
here,
would
have
been
a
profitable
endeavor.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
that's
one
factor
that
i
point
to
among
several
to--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--it
is.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
i
believe
that
along
with
other
factors
such
as
the
constant
complaints
to
congress
about
how
clecs
had
the
better
side
of
the
deal
than
the
ilecs,
along
with
the
pledges
of
the
defendants
that
they
would
do,
and
that
they
didn't
do.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
your
honor,
that...
i
certainly
don't
expect
that
that
is
the
evidence
that
we
would
be
relying
on
at
trial
or
at
summary
judgment
to
support
our
case,
but
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
we
don't
have
to
have
the
evidence
to
support
our
case.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
i
don't
think
that
the
court,
if
the
court
comes
to
a
conclusion
on
its
own
that
the
facts
that
we
have
alleged,
which
is
that
it
would
have
been
in
their
interest
to
do
this
in
the
absence
of
conspiracy,
is
wrong,
then
the
court
is
not
following
conventional
pleading
standards.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
you
have
to
say
what
it
is.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
if
it's
implausible,
that
might
be
a
different
consideration.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
my
contention
as
to
what
the
law
is
is
that
we
are
not
required
to
plead
plus
factors.
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
have,
and
that
our
factual
pleading
of
plus
factors
has
to
be
treated
as
true
for
purposes
of
a--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
can
be
if...
because
the
court
is
not,
the
correct
function
of
the
court
under
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
is
not
to
be
decided
by
whether
it
believes
or
is
persuaded
by
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
if
the
allegation
is
also
made
that
the
defendant
was
negligent,
then
i
think
it
clearly
satisfies
the
pleading
standard
under
form
9.
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
detailed
complaint
than
the
sample
that
comprises
form
9
of
the
rules.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
yes,
because
that's
more
than
nothing,
and
the
rule
in
form
9
contains
nothing.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
that
is
the
situation
that
any
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
in
in
a
horizontal
conspiracy
case
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
know
for
certain
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
we
have
observed
market
facts
which
are
suggestive
of
a
conspiracy
and
we
allege
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
now
under
conventional
standards,
all
we
would
have
to
do
is
allege
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
say
what
it
was.
we
wouldn't
have
to
plead
a
basis
to
infer
that
we
are
correct
or
incorrect
because
that's
not
the
analysis
that
rule
12(b)(6)--
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
--if
the
court...
if
we
were
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
finder
of
fact
that
the
conduct
we
have
pointed
to
here
was
or
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
defendants
in
the
absence
of
a
conspiracy,
we
were
to
prove
that
as
distinguished
from
pleading,
we
would
satisfy
matsushita.
now
at
that
stage
in
the
case,
it's
inconceivable
that
there
won't
be
all
kinds
of
other
memos
and,
you
know,
real
world
things
that
will
shed
light
on
why
the
defendants
internally
think
they
did
this.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
well,
to
address
that
concern,
which
we
share,
because
we
don't
gain
anything
with
matsushita.
at
the
end
of
the
road
in
the
case,
we
don't
gain
anything
by
pursuing
a
case
for
years
in
an
unnecessarily
burdensome
way
if
we
are
not
sure
that
it's
going
to
prevail.
so
we
proposed
in
this
case
a
phased
discovery
process,
pursuant
to
which
you
would
first
have
discovery
into
conspiracy,
and
then
the
court
would
have
an
early
opportunity
for
a
matsushita
motion
and
we
either
carry
the
day
at
that
point
or
we
don't.
that's
discovery.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
it's
at
the
court's
discretion
when
to
entertain
the
motion
for
class
certification.
in
this
particular
case
the
defendants,
a
couple
of
the
defendants
proposed
that
we
include
in
that
phased
discovery
proposal
class
certification
as
an
additional
subject
of
that
first
phase
of
discovery,
and
we
would
be
amenable
to
that
as
a
compromise.
but
the
point,
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
that
discovery
as
to
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
in
this
case
in
order
to
satisfy
that
first
phased
analysis,
would
not
need
to
be
terribly
burdensome
and
wouldn't
necessarily
be
more
burdensome
than
all
kinds
of
other
cases.
it's
really
a
very
targeted
issue.
i
think
it's
actually
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
cases
of
this
kind
and
it's
actually
a
way
that
the
court
has
proposed
dealing
with
similar
issues
in
the
past
in
the
anderson
versus
creighton
case.
mr.
j.
douglas
richards
we'd...
we
would
ask
for
production
of
documents
reflecting
their
thinking
process
about
entering
into
one
another's
territories.
and
that
would
be
very
enlightening.
and
after
we
get
those
documents
we
would
have
a
much
clearer
idea
and
be
able
to
share
with
the
court
a
much
clearer
idea
of
the
entire
picture
of
a
kind
that
we
can't
have
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage.
thank
you.
