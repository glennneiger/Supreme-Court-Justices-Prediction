justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
have
to
say
orally,
i
wish
you
would
reconsider
that?
because
if
that's,
if
that's
all
you're
arguing,
i
don't
see
anything
to
be
gained
by...
by
such
a
holding.
it
doesn't
tell
you...
you
know,
this
is
a
suit
against
a
number
of
large
corporations,
nationwide
businesses,
thousands
of
employees.
and
on
this
complaint
you
have
no
idea
who
agreed
with
whom,
where,
when,
any
of
that.
i
can
understand
that
you're
saying
that
does
not
give
us
enough
notice
to
prepare
a
defense.
but
if
you
say
oh,
but
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
so
long
as
they
said
orally.
i
mean...
forget
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
seek
a
more
specific
statement?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
why
didn't
you
ask
when
and
where
was
this
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
can
be
held,
can
be
thought
to
hold
that?
is
there
any
interpretation
of
what
they
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
parallel
action
would
indicate
that
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
for
example
they,
you
have
nine
companies
that
change
their
price
at
the
same
hour
of
the
same
day,
10
months
in
a
row.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're,
you're
not
saying
that
parallel
action
can
never
create
this,
this
kind
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
if
it
didn't?
i
mean,
i
mean
face
the
question
that
justice
stevens
puts.
suppose
you
have
a
complaint
that
says
nothing
else
except
that
these
defendants
entered
into
an
agreement
in...
in
restraint
of
trade.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
barnett,
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
barnett
i
thought
you
had,
you
had
said
that
you
don't
need
to
indicate
the
particular
day
of
the
agreement.
that
it
would
be
enough
if
it
was
the
kind
of
parallel
action
that
suggested
an
agreement
that
over
nine
years
they
all
raised
the
price
at
the
same
time.
now
that
doesn't
really
give
the
defendant
notice
of,
you
know,
what
individuals
were
responsible
for
this,
when
it
occurred.
but
you
say
that
would
still
be
adequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
shame
on
them.
but
we're
trying
to
get
this
case
right
and,
you
know,
i
don't
care
what
position
they
took
before.
i
care
about
what
the
right
answer
is,
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
you
can
simply
allege
in
a
complaint,
i
was
injured
by
the
negligence
of
the
defendant
in
driving
an
automobile,
period.
does
that
satisfy
the,
the
federal
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
agreement
happens
at
one
moment
in
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
meetings
of
the
minds,
meeting
of
the
minds.
i
used
to
each
contracts.
meeting
of
the
minds
at
one
moment
in
time,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think,
by
the
way,
that
that
argument
applies
not
just
to
the
keeping
out
the
upstart
claim,
but
also
to
the
not
entering
the
other
alleged
conspirator
s'
fields
of
monopoly,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
because
if
i,
if
i
enter
your
field
i
know
that
you're
going
to
enter
mine.
it
just
doesn't
pay
for
me
to
do
it.
yeah,
i
can
make
money,
but
i'll
lose
money.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
natural
for
companies
that
have
a
certain
geographic
area
in
which
they
are
the,
the
principal,
the
selected
instrument
and
although
they
technically
can
enter
somebody
else's
geographic
area,
they
know
that
if
they
do
it
they
will
be
subjected
to
the
same
thing.
that
is
nothing
more
than
conscious
parallelism.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
several
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
used
to
work
in
the
field
of
telecommunications
and
if
the
criterion
is
that
happens
which
congress
expected
to
happen
when
it
passed
its
law,
your
case
is
very
weak.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
need
what
is
called
the
plus
factor,
and
i
gather
that
you
acknowledge
that
if
i
disagree
with
you
that
this,
this
parallel
action
seemed
to
be
against
the
self
interest
of
the
companies,
you
no
longer
have
a
plus
factor
and
you
would
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
you
have
to
do
to
prove,
to
establish
a
plus
factor
is
to
say
in
your
pleading,
and
there
is
a
plus
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
say
what
it
is,
that's
all,
and
even
if
it's
implausible?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
money
do
you
think
it
would
have
cost
the
defendants
by
then
to
assemble
all
of
the
documents
that
you're
going
to
be
interested
in
looking
at?
how
many
buildings
will
have
to
be
rented
to
store
those
documents
and
how
many
years
will
be
expended
in,
in
gathering
all
the
materials?
