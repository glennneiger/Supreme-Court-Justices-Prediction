chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
bell
atlantic
corporation
vs.
twombly.
mr.
kellogg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
justice
stevens's
question
was
that
the
allegation
was
that
after
that
date
they
agreed
not
to
compete.
that
states...
that
states
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
barnett.
mr.
richards,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
where
does
it
set
forth
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
temporal,
geographic,
the
identities,
but
where
does
it
set
forth
anything
evincing
an
agreement
other
than
the
allegation
of
parallel
conduct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any,
is
there
an
allegation
of
an
agreement
apart
from
the
parallel
conduct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
does
that
consist
of?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
states...
would
it
state
an
antitrust
violation
if
had
you
a
grocery
store
on
one
corner
of
the
block
and
a
pet
store
on
the
other
corner
of
the
block
and
you
say,
well,
the
grocery
store
is
not
selling
pet
supplies
and
they
could
make
money
if
they
did,
therefore
that's
an
antitrust
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
all
the
facts
that
are
alleged.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
when
we
get
back
to
the
paragraph
51,
let
me
start
with
your
statement
at
the
bottom
half
of
that
paragraph,
that
plaintiffs
allege
upon
information
and
belief
that
they
have
entered
into
a
contract,
is
a
conclusion
based
upon
your
prior
allegations,
it's
not
an
independent
allegation
of
an
agreement.
it's
saying
because
of
this
parallel
conduct,
because
we
think
it's
contrary
to
their
self
interest,
therefore,
they
have
agreed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
a
statement
of
a
conclusion
based
upon
your
allegations
that
precede
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
a
statement
that
independently
there
apart
from
all
of
this,
there's
an
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
how
do
you
tell?
i
mean,
companies
get
proposals
all
the
time.
here's
a
way
you
could
make
more
money.
you
could
all
enter
the
market
in
some
foreign
country.
the
people
decide,
i
mean,
life
is
short
and
they've
got
certain
objectives,
and
they
don't
have
to
do
everything
that
an
economist
might
think
is
in
their
economic
self
interest.
i
mean,
what
is
the
limiting
self
interest
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
an
adequate
response
for
the
executive
to
say,
i'm
a
little
risk
averse,
i
want
to
see
how
things
work
out
over
the
next
five
years.
they
keep
changing
the
laws,
the
regulatory
environment.
that's
why
i
didn't
jump
in
and
compete?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
think
you
have
to
prove
that
either?
i
mean,
you
don't
think
you
have
to
prove
anything
more
than
what
you've
alleged
in
the
complaint
about
the
background
context,
the
parallel
conduct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
would
it
be
focused
if
you're
talking
about
whether
it's
in
their
economic
interest?
you
would
have
to
say
why,
why
didn't
you
enter
into
this
particular
realm
of
competition
and
they
would
say,
well
because
we
were
doing
other
things.
we
had
other
areas
that
we
were
focusing
on.
and
they
would
have
to
document
all
that
to
your
satisfaction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
richard,
mr.
kellogg,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
05-1126,
bell
atlantic
corporation
v.
twombly.
