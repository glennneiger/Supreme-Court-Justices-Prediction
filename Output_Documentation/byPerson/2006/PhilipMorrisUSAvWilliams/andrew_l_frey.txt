mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
following
this
court's
remand
to
the
oregon
courts
to
reconsider
their
decision
in
light
of
state
farm,
a
task
at
which
we
submit
the
oregon
courts
completely
failed.
it
presents
two
independent
but
thematically
interrelated
issues,
both
of
which
implicate
what
the
court
said
in
state
farm,
which
is
that,
and
i
quote,
"courts
must
ensure
that
the
measure
of
punishment
is
both
reasonable
and
proportionate
to
the
amount
of
harm
to
the
plaintiff
and
to
the
general
damages
recovered.
"
now
significantly,
respondent
defends
neither...
oh,
i
should
stop
for
a
minute
and
describe
the
issues.
so
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
oregon
supreme
court
properly
held
that
philip
morris
was
correctly
denied
an
instruction
which
would
have
told
the
jury
that
it
was
not
to
punish
for
harm
to
nonparties.
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
that
that
instruction
was
legally
incorrect,
it
was
proper
for
the
jury
to
punish
for
harm
to
nonparties,
and
therefore
the
instruction
was
correctly
denied.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
the
key
paragraph
from
number
34
which
is
set
forth
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
as
well
as
numerous
other
places
in
the
materials.
it
says,
the
size
of
any
punishment
should
bear
reasonable
relationship
to
the
harm
caused
to
jesse
williams
by
the
defendant's
punishable
misconduct.
although
you
may
consider
the
extent
of
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
what
that
reasonable
relationship
is,
you're
not
to
punish
the
defendant
for
the
impact
of
its
alleged
misconduct
of
other
persons
who
may
bring
lawsuits
of
their
own,
etc.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that's
what
it
says,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
confuse
the
jury,
and
i'm
confident
that
with
that
instruction,
counsel
could
explain
it.
but
let
me
stop
here,
because
i
know
this
was
something
that
justice
scalia
expressed
some
uncertainty
about
in
the
state
farm
argument,
and
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
said
they
didn't
clearly
understand.
to
consider
the
conduct
means
to
evaluate
it
in
connection
with
assessing
the
blameworthiness
of
the
conduct
being
punished.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
second
part
of
it
is,
what
punishment
means
is
what
would
be
done
in
a
class
action,
for
instance,
to
impose
punishment
for
all
the
harm
suffered
by
oregon
smokers.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
this
aspect.
it
held
that
it
was
proper
to
punish
for
harm
to
nonparties.
now
this,
in
our
view,
this
instruction,
and
there's
always
a
danger
when
you
add
words
to
an
instruction
that
you
will
add
something
that
a
court
will
find
was
incorrect
and
therefore
deny
the
instruction,
even
though
the
essence
of
it
was
correct.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
20(a)
to
21(a)
of
the
appendix,
where
the
court
discusses,
comes
to
its
conclusion
on
this
point.
and
it
says,
the
instruction
would
have
prohibited
the
jury
from
punishing
the
defendant
for
the
impact
of
its
alleged
conduct
on
other
persons
even
if
those
persons
were
oregonians
who
were
harmed.
but
on
28(a)
it
says,
because
the
proposed
jury
did
not
accurately
reflect
the
law,
this
is
not
a
statement
about
philip
morris's
position,
the
trial
court
did
not
commit
reversible
error
when
it
refused
to
give
it.
so
i
think
the
court
was
quite
clear
in
saying...
let
me
complete
my
answer,
because
i
think
considering
it
moves
the
needle
along
the
scale
of
allowable
punishment
for
the
harm
to
jesse
williams,
but
it
does
not
abandon
the
principle
of
proportionality
to
that
harm,
whereas
punishing
for
it
is
what
you
would
do
in
a
class
action.
you
would
punish
for
all
the
harms
to
all
the
oregonians.
this
is
a
one-way
class
action
in
which
philip
morris
was
exposed
to
global
punishment
by
the
jury
without
any
of
the
protections
of
a
class
action.
so--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
what
you
do
is
decide
the
federal
issue,
which
i
think
is
whether
they
were
correct
in
the
legal
proposition
that
they
asserted.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
i
do
want
to
question
the
premise.
first
of
all,
the
instruction
says
basically
what
this
court
said
in
bmw,
which
is
where
it
drew
precisely
that
distinction.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
there
is...
the
concept
may
be
abstract,
the
difference
between
considering
and
punishing,
but
it's
quite
clear
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
i
think
it
can
be
made
quite
clear
to
the
jury
with
the
benefit
of
the
proper
instruction,
and
i
don't...
i
don't
have
any--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
we
had
this
instruction,
if
we
had
this
instruction
which
i
believe
is
correct,
there
is
nothing
incorrect
about
this
instruction.
it
is
correct
that
the
jury
may
consider.
we
are
not
challenging
that
the
jury
may
consider
the
conduct
and
may
determine
that
the
conduct--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
the
instruction
said--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
the
instruction
says
that
you
are
to
consider
it
in
connection
with
determining
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
do,
because
conduct
that
is
more
blameworthy,
in
terms
of
determining,
as
this
court
has
said
in
all
its
cases,
and
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
the
whole
inquiry--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
as
this
court
has
made
quite
clear,
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct
is
an
important
factor
in
determining
where
along
the
scale
of
reasonable
relationships
in
a
particular
case
you
might,
the
relationship
might
be
reasonable.
so,
more
conduct
that
is
calculated
to
harm
large
numbers
of
people
can
be
found
more
blameworthy
as
to
warrant
a
higher
proportion,
a
higher
relationship
between
the
punitive
and
compensatory
damages.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
you
are--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
that
the
semantical
quibbling
is
not
something
that
the
jury
would
have
difficulty
with,
in
my
opinion.
but
let
me
try
to
explain
the
difference
this
way.
if
you're
considering
the
conduct
in
relation
in
determining
what
is
the
proper
punishment
for
the
harm
to
jesse
williams,
you
should
come
up
with
a
number
that
can
be
properly
replicated
in
case
after
case
if
other
juries
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
about
the
conduct.
if
you
are
punishing
for
the
conduct,
you
should
come
up
with
a
number
that
precludes
further
punishment
for
the
same,
punishing
for
the
harm,
further
punishment
for
the
same
harm,
for
the
same
causes
of
action
for
punitive
damages
that
various
oregonians
had.
so
there's
a
fundamental
difference
in
that
respect
between
considering
and
punishing
for
it,
and
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
contest
this,
that
the
character
of
the
conduct
can
be
considered
in
determining
the
proper
level
or
allowable
level
of
punitive
damages,
that
included
the
character
of
the
conduct
is
the
intended
scope
of
the
harm,
if
it's
an
isolated
incident,
if
it's
a
consistent
pattern
of
misconduct.
so,
i
don't
think
we
could
properly
have
told
the
jury
that
they
may
not
consider
the
conduct
without
getting
ourselves
in
serious
trouble.
so...
and
i
don't,
i
don't
think,
and
the
difference
is
potentially
enormous.
if
you
think
about
a
jury
that
was
deciding
a
punitive
damages
class
action
and
a
jury
that
was
told
that
they
had
to
punish
for
the
harm
to
the
particular
plaintiff
in
the,
in
the
particular
case,
it's,
it's
obvious
that
the
results
would
be
vastly
different
in
those
cases.
and
the
problem
we
were
worried
about
was
that
the
jury
would
think
of
itself
as
the
punishment
agency
to
impose
statewide
punishment
for
the
harms
to
all
oregon
smokers
who
were
deceived
by
philip
morris--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
similar,
but
what
he
can't
do
is
punish
for
crimes
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
suppose
we
had
a
mail
fraud
prosecution--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
true.
that's
certainly
true.
that's
why
our
point
is
that
it's
one
thing
to
produce
a
punishment
that
can
properly
be
replicated
in
case
after
case
without
producing
an
excessive
total
punishment.
it's
another
thing
to
punish
in
case
after
case
for
the
same
harms.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
this
was
a
mail
fraud
prosecution
for
defrauding
jesse
williams
into
buying
cigarettes
and
the
punishment
was
five
years
for
that,
the
judge
could
consider
in
setting
the
punishment
between
zero
and
five
the
fact
that
this
was
part
of
a
scheme
that
was
intended
to
or
may
have
deceived
large
numbers
of
other
people
in
setting
the
punishment
between
zero
and
five.
what
the
judge
cannot
do
and
what
we
were
worried
the
jury
would
do
here
and
what
we
think
the
size
of
its
verdict
may
suggest
it
actually
did
here
is
to
think
that
they
could
punish
it
that
time
not
just
5
years,
but
10
or
15
or
20
for
all
of
the
other
punishments,
for
all
the
other
wrongs
that
they
find
to
have
been
done.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
but
i
think
the
disgorgement
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
other
side
suffers
from
exactly
the
same
problem
as
the
global
punishment
problem.
that
is,
you
can't...
if
you
disgorged
in
every
case
all
the
profits
that
were
earned
from
selling
cigarettes
to
oregonians
and
to
oregonians
became
who
sick--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't,
i
don't
think
that...
our
complaint
is
not
that
the
plaintiff
is
getting
the
money.
our
complaint
is
with
how
much
we're
being
punished
and
what
the
procedural
regime
is
that
has
led
to
punishing
us.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
first
of
all,
that's
not
the
law
in
oregon.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
have
no...
well,
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
this,
on
this
statute,
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
harm
to
others,
harm
to
nonparties
problem.
the
statute
does
not
require
giving
credit,
only
consideration.
even
if
it,
even
if
it
did,
it
operates
as
a
one-way
ratchet.
that
is,
you
keep
making
awards
until
you've
reached
the
maximum
that
would
be
allowable
for
all
the
conduct
even
though
juries,
properly
instructed,
might
have
awarded
substantially
less
and
even
though
many
juries
might
exonerate
the
defendant
totally,
as
many
juries
have
in
tobacco
cases.
so
the
oregon
regime
is,
is
a
formula
for
having
what
amounts
to
excessive
punishment
or
at
least
unfair
punishment.
and
finally,
the,
the
30.925,
which
was
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals,
requires
submitting
this
evidence
to
the
jury
and,
as
the
trial
court
said
in
this
case
at
page
195a
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
no
telling
whether
submitting
the
prior
awards
to
the
jury
would
produce
higher
or
lower
awards
in
this
case.
so
i
think
it's
an
entirely
illusory
protection
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
was
going
to
say
that
because
our
concern
is
structural
with
the
design
of
the
oregon
system
as
it's
been
approved
by
the
oregon
supreme
court,
i
don't
think
this
inadequate
remedy
can
save
that
system.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
the
first
part
of
your
premise
is
clearly
correct
and
totally
consistent
with
the
position
we
are
taking.
whether
it
happened
here
or
not
is
an
interesting
question.
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
limiting
instruction,
which
was
basically
what
this
was.
you
can
use
the
evidence
for
one
purpose,
legitimate
purpose,
but
don't
use
it
for
an
illegitimate
purpose.
but
we
can't
tell
ordinarily,
because
jury
deliberations
are
secret
and
we
can't
probe
what
they
have
decided,
we
can't
probe
whether
they
have
imposed
global
punishment
or
not.
but
we
anticipate
the
problem.
we
proposed
an
instruction
which
would
as
best
we
could
at
the
time
address
the
problem.
maybe
it
could
be
edited
up
to
be
a
little
sharper.
but
i
think
it
contains
the
essential
point
that
we're
driving
at
here
today.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you're
raising
a
question
whether
that
would
be
an
adequate--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
fundamental
principle.
i
believe
the
instruction
fairly
captured
it.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
for
refusing
the
instruction.
keep
in
mind
that
in
state
farm
the
court
said
the
defendant
upon
request
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
subject
of
extraterritorial
punishment.
now,
this
is
conceptually
not
really
different
from
extraterritorial
punishment.
we
wouldn't--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--certainly.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
still
apply
because
different
factfinders,
different
juries,
might
reach
different
conclusions
on
the
same
evidence,
assuming
that
a
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
is
not
proper.
what
you're
doing
is
preempting,
you're
allowing
a
potentially
aberrational
verdict,
which
there
could
be
in
many
cases,
to
preempt
the
work
of
other
juries.
the
whole
essence
of
the
idea
that
we
were
trying
to
convey
here
and
the
legal
principle
that
we
are
arguing
today
is
to
confine
the
jury
to
its
proper
domain
and
its
domain
is
the
case
before
it.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
accepting
the
premise,
accepting
the
premise,
we
don't
disagree
with
your
conclusion.
that
is,
if
the
jury
could
find
that
they
could
punish
this
more
severely.
what
they
cannot
do
is
punish
it
globally.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
can
certainly
consider
the
scope
of
the
intended
scheme.
the
fact
that
it
didn't
have
evidence
didn't
stop
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
from
finding
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
from
endorsing
the
finding
that
many
oregonians
were
deceived,
even
though--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--right.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is.
i
think
in
txo
the
court--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if
there
were
more,
if
there
were
other
people
who
had
causes
of
action,
then
i
think
there
is
a
problem.
in
your
hypothesis
if
only
one
person
is
injured--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that's
what
the
court
said
in
bmw
in
effect,
that
the
jury
could
consider
even
out
of
state
conduct
insofar
as
it
revealed
something
about
the
blameworthiness
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
the
defendant's
state
of
mind,
the
defendant's
intentions.
we're
not
saying
that
these
things
can't
be
considered
for
that
purpose.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
other
people
can
bring
their
own
lawsuits
and
punishment
in
those
lawsuits...
if
$79.5
million
is
right
for
jesse
williams--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
because
the
problem
is
a
problem
with
the
design.
if
you
punish
in
the
beginning...
if
you
have
a,
b,
c,
and
d
who
are
potentially
injured
and
you
punish
in
a's
case
for
the
harm
to
b,
c,
and
d
and
then
the
defendant--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if
you're
punishing
for
the
risk
of
harm
then
the
same
punishment
would
be
appropriate
in
b's
case
and
c's
case
and
d's
case.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
hasn't
been
paid
yet.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
be
subject
to
that
statute.
now,
there's
a
question
whether
under
the
master
settlement
agreement
it
would
have
to
be
paid
back
to
the
companies.
but
that's
a
separate
question
that's
not
before
the
court.
but
our
position--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
we
have
no
protection
for
that.
we
have
no
protection.
first
of
all,
this
verdict--
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--and
if
we
win
the
next
case
and
we
win
the
case
after
that
and
we
win
the
case
after
that,
when
do
we
get
credit?
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right,
but
the
regime
is
flawed
in
its
structure
because
it's
a
ratchet
to
get
up
to
the
highest
possible
level
even
though
juries
who
understood
the
underlying
constitutional
principle
might
award
less.
so
i'd
like
to
save,
if
i
may,
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me,
let
me
start
with,
let
me
start
with
the
observation
that
mr.
peck
has
argued
as
though
this
was
a
class
action,
as
though
total
deterrence,
disgorgement,
and
all
these
things
were
all
to
be
achieved
in
this
case,
which
is
the
heart
of
our
problem
here
with
the
denial
of
the
instruction.
he
referred
to
this
other
case
in
oregon,
which
is
the
schwarz
case,
as
finding
liability
also,
but
what
he
didn't
mention
was
that
on
the
issue
of
the
fraud
relating,
involving
the
relationship
between
cancer,
between
smoking
and
health,
the
jury
found
for
the
defendant.
they
found
liability
on
a
different
issue,
but
not
on
this
issue.
so
it
hardly
proves
that
we
would
lose
all
cases.
it's
also
true
that
in
that
case,
where
the
jury
did
not
receive...
we
asked
for
but
we
didn't
get
an
instruction
like
this...
the
jury
actually
came
back
and
said:
does
our
award
have
to
be
reasonably
related
to
the
injury
to
mrs.
schwarz?
and
the
judge
refused
to
tell
them
the
answer
to
that.
so
juries
do
understand
this
problem
and
they
do
think
about
this
problem.
the
suggestion
was
made
that
you
can
present
prior
awards
to
the
trial
judge.
now,
i,
i
hope
during
my
opening
argument
i
covered
the
reasons
why
there's
a
structural
deficiency
in
the
system
if
the
system
even
called
for
getting
credit,
which
the
statutes
don't
require.
but
you
should
know
that
the
oregon
plaintiffs'
lawyers
have
argued
that
under
the
oregon
constitution
it
must
be
presented
to
the
jury
or
is
it
may
not
be
considered
by
the
court.
so
while
here
he
wants
to
assure
you
that
it
can
be
presented
to
the
court,
that's
not
the
position
they
are
taking
below.
on
the
question
by
justice
souter
about
whether
you
should
send
it
back
and
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
meant
by
its
discussion,
if
it
didn't
mean
what
we
say
it
meant
they
should
have
reversed
and
said
were
entitled
to
the
instruction
or
identified
some
other
reason
why
we're
not
entitled
to
the
instruction.
now,
there
may
be
some
independent
state
ground
that
you're
not
aware
of,
but
you
ought
to
say
at
a
minimum
that
they
were
wrong
and
that
a
defendant
in
a
punitive
damages
case
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
of
this
general
nature,
and
then
we
can
let
the
oregon
courts
on
remand
address
whether
there
is
some
other
problem
which
we
frankly
don't
see,
but
that
would
be
for
them.
now,
if
mr.
peck
is
right
about
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
there
should
be
plenty
of
lawsuits
and
plenty
of
liability.
if
there
isn't,
the
court
can't
speculate
that
we
ought
to
punish
philip
morris
more
in
this
case
because
other
people
are
not
sufficiently
aggrieved
to
sue.
that
seems
to
me
totally
impermissible
speculation.
on
the
question
of
harm
versus
conduct,
the
unit
of
prosecution
is
the
cause
of
action,
so
that
it's
not,
it's
not,
you
can
repeatedly...
in
our,
in
our
submission
you
can
repeatedly
punish
a
defendant
for
the
same
conduct,
for
the
impact
of
the
same
conduct
causing
injury
to
different
people.
what
we
are
basically
saying
is
that
there
are,
there
are
potentially
many
causes
of
action
out
there
for
this
conduct
and
the
punishment
in
this
case
should
be
limited
to
the
cause
of
action
that
is
being
tried
before
the
jury
in
this
case.
let's
see
if
i...
if
i
have
anything
else.
justice
stevens
talked
about
the
ambiguity
of
the
closing
argument
and
i
agree
it's
not
clear
what
plaintiff's
counsel
was
exactly
saying.
it
could
be
interpreted
in
different
ways.
but
that
is
a
reason
to
have
a
cautionary
instruction,
not
a
reason
to
forgo
one,
to
make
sure
the
jury
understands
the
applicable
principles.
thank
you.
