justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
we
could
leave
it
up
to
them
whether
they
want
to
disallow
the
instruction
for
a
different
reason,
but
the
fact
is
they
disallowed
it
for
the
reason
that
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
can
say
that
is
error
and
remand
it
to
them.
that
might
not
make
you
very
happy,
but
it
would
be
up
to
them
whether
or
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
if
it
had
said
that,
i
would
have
no
trouble
with
it.
what
it
says
is,
you
may
consider
it
in
determining
what
the
reasonable
relationship
is
between
the
harm
caused
to
jesse
williams
and
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
assessed.
i
don't
see
how
injury
to
others
can
have
any
bearing
upon
whether
the
punitive
damages
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
jesse
williams'
harm.
that's
my
problem
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
can't
really
find
that
other
people
were
harmed.
the
jury
doesn't
have
evidence
before
it
except
as
to
this
person.
the
most
the
jury
can
find,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the,
the
activity
engaged
in
bore
a
very
serious
risk
of
harming
other
people.
i
think
a
jury
could
find
that.
and
therefore,
the
activity
is
more
heinous
and
should
be
punished
more
severely.
but
i...
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
i'm
quibbling,
but
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that
this
jury
can
decide
that
other
people
have
been
harmed
and
take
into
account
the
harm
that
it
found
other
people
suffered
in
deciding
the
penalty.
and
i
don't
think
this
jury
has
any
basis
for
finding
that
other
people
were
harmed.
it
could
say
there
was
a
serious
risk
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
losing
me,
counsel.
what,
what
specifically
is
wrong
with
the
instruction
proposed
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
briefly
as
possible,
one,
two,
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
have
been
a
proper
instruction
if
the
second
sentence
had
read,
although
you
may
consider
the
extent
of
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
what
the...
what
that
reasonable
relationship
is,
although
you
may
consider
the
extent
of
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
how
heinous
the
crime,
the
action
of
the
defendant
was,
and
hence...
what,
what
that
reasonable
relationship
is?
if
you
had
just
added
in
that
additional
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
that's
left
out
of
it.
now
does
leaving
that
out
of
it
make
it
erroneous?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
but
reprehensibility
analysis
is
part
of
the
reasonable
relationship.
the
more
reprehensible
it
is
the
higher
the
ratio
can
be,
according
to
our
cases
as
i
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
this
instruction
was
too
favorable
to
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it
allowed
them
to
consider
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
think
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
consider
harm,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
the
point
you're
making
is
not
the
basis
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
the
instruction
was
properly
disallowed.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said
it
was
properly
disallowed
because
you
can
take
into
account
directly
the
harm
to
other
people,
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
only
objection
is
that
they
left
out
the
reason
why
it
is
relevant
to
determining
what
the
ratio
should
be?
they
just
didn't
say
you
can
consider
it
in
connection
with
reprehensibility.
why
is
that
crucial?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
was
it
critical?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
favorable
to
you.
too
favorable
to
you
again,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
if...
your
friend
says,
what
if
we
never
get
assessed
for
any
other
case?
where
do
we
make
up
this
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
win
every
other
case
in
oregon.
