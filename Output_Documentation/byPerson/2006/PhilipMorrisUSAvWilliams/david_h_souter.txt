david
h.

isn't
that
the
problem?
if
the
instruction
had
said
that,
you
would
have
a
very
different
instruction,
and
i'm
bothered
by
the
instruction
too
for
just
that
reason.
it
says
you
may
consider,
and
if
i
were
a
juror
parsing
the
instruction,
i
would
say,
"why?
"
"you've
just
told
me
i'm
not
supposed
to
punish
them.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
this
is
an
argument
you're
making
to
us,
but
i
don't
know
how
a
juror
is
supposed
to
figure
this
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me...
let
me
focus
the
problem
that
i
have
right
now
this
way.
if
i
look
at
the
oregon
supreme
court
opinion,
and
particularly
at
the
point
that
you
mention
in
20
and
21,
i
have
to
say
i,
i
read
the
opinion
the
way
you
read
the
opinion.
i
read
them
the
same,
just
what
you
claimed
they
were
saying.
the
difficulty
that
i
have
is
because
i
think
the
instruction
that
was
proposed
on
behalf
of
your
client
was
not
a
clear
instruction,
i
have
great
difficulty
in
seeing
how
i
could
find
that
it
was
error
to
refuse
to
give
the
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
my
problem
is,
if
i
think
they
really
did
have
the
wrong
view
of
the
law
but
the
issue
was
focused
at
the
trial
court
by
a
request
for
an
instruction
which
i
think
was
properly
denied,
what
do
i
do?
do
i
concentrate
on
what
they
said
in
the
opinion
or
do
i
concentrate
on
what
i
think
was
the
deficiency
of
the
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
they
would
respond,
when
they
made
that,
when
they
gave
that
explanation
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
they
were
responding
to
a
claim
of
error
which
was
focused
and
raised
at
the
trial
level
by
the
request
for
an
instruction,
which
strikes
me
as
probably
an
unsound
instruction,
an
unsound
request.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect,
it
would
give
you
another
chance
in
oregon.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
a
good
thing
we
weren't
instructing
a
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
do
too.
i
don't
have
any
trouble
with
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
question,
if
the
juror
were
to
speak
up.
it
doesn't
answer
the
question.
consider
for
what?
how?
why
am
i
supposed
to
be
considering
it
when
you've
just
told
me
not
to
punish?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
not
punish
for
other--
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say,
i
mean
justice
alito
asked
you
a
question
about
the
footnote.
and
i,
in
all
candor
i
think
you
told
us
more
about
the,
your
case
than
about
the
footnote,
but
let
me
ask
you
basically
the
same
question
about
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
meant
in
the
passage
that
runs
from
the
bottom
of
20(a)
up
to
21.
it
says
"philip
morris's
proposed
jury
instructions
would
have
prohibited
the
jury
from
punishing
the
defendant
for
the
impact
of
its
alleged
misconduct
on
other
persons
even
if
those
other
persons
were
oregonians
who
were
harmed
by
the
same
conduct
that
had
harmed
williams,
and
in
the
same
way.
"
"as
we
noted
that
is
not
correct
as
an
independent
matter
of
oregon
law.
"
and
so
on.
that
is
not
a
totally
unambiguous
statement.
i
will
concede
that,
but
isn't
the
most
obvious
reasoning,
reading
of
that
a
reading
that
says
you
can
punish
for
harm
to
others,
so
long
as
those
others
are
oregonians
and
not
people
in
other
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
was
it
critical?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
scalia
said,
you
know,
they
left
out
this
one
little
bit.
why
was
that
critical?
what's
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying,
i
think
you're
saying
the
jury
couldn't
have
figured
that
out
without
somebody
telling
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
