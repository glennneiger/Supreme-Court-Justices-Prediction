justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you...
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
think
about
a
suggestion
that
i
got
from
something
that
justice
scalia
said.
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
making
it
or
not,
but
i'll
make
the
suggestion
and
see
what
you
think.
suppose
that
this
case...
suppose
we
were
to
say,
there
are
many
issues
in
this
case,
some
of
them
very
difficult,
but
one
thing
we're
certain
about:
you
cannot
in
a
trial
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
in
a
trial
of
plaintiff
versus
defendant
take
money
from
the
defendant
and
give
it
to
the
plaintiff
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
the
defendant
for
something
he
did
to
a
different
person
who
wasn't
there.
now...
so
he
couldn't
defend
against
him.
that
person
didn't
present
a
claim.
so
we
are
certain
of
that.
now,
we're
not
certain
whether
that's
what
happened
here.
it
may
have
done.
there
is
certainly
a
lot
of
language
to
suggest
it,
and
there
is
some
language
the
other
way.
so
we
remand
it
to
the
court
with
that
instruction
that
they
cannot
permit
this
to
have
happened
if
it
happened.
whether
it
happened
and
what
happened
is
a
matter
of
oregon
law
in
large
part
and
things
about
instructions,
etc.
now,
what's
your
view
of
that
kind
of
disposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe,
but
it's
possible
the
oregon
court
would
say:
well,
no
instructions
are
perfect,
but...
and
no
set
of
jury
instructions
is
perfect.
but
if
we
look
at
the
jury
instructions
without
the
suggested
one
that
was
rejected
and
then
we
look
at
the
suggested
one,
we
find
the
suggested
one
had
many
things
wrong
with
it,
not
just,
you
know,
problems,
confusion,
et
cetera.
we
find
the
instructions
weren't
perfect
but,
given
oregon
evidentiary
law,
we
think
the
trial
judge
made
reasonable
decisions,
therefore
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
that's
what
worrying
me,
what's
worrying
me
about
this
is
i
see
as
we
try
to
determine
what
this
instruction
said,
whether
it
was
good
enough,
whether
the
instructions
without
it
are
good
enough,
that
we're
going
to
be
in
a
kind
of
bog
of
mixtures
of
constitutional
law,
unclear
oregon
state
law,
not
certain
exactly
what
was
meant
by
whom
in
the
context
of
the
trial,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
why...
why
though?
i'm
having
the
same
problem.
as
i
read
the
sentence
that
we
have
just
been
quoted
it
seems
to
me
at
first
blush
that
it's
completely
right.
you
may
consider
the
harm,
the
extent
of
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
what
the
reasonable
relationship
is.
now
you
have
to
be
sophisticated
in
this.
don't
ask
me
how
the
jury
is,
but
assuming
that
they
are,
that
means
that
the
more
severely
awful
the
conduct,
the
higher
the
ratio
between
the
damage
award
and
the
injury
suffered
by
this
victim
in
court.
and
if
it's
really
bad,
you're
going
to
maybe
have
a
hundred
times
this
compensation
instead
of
only
ten
times
or
five
times.
so...
we
take
it
into
account,
the
extent
of
the
harm
that
could
be
suffered,
in
deciding
what
that
ratio
should
be.
that
means
it
goes
to
the
evilness
of
the
conduct.
but
you
are
not
to
punish
the
defendant
for
the
impact
of
its
alleged
misconduct
on
other
persons
who
aren't
here
in
court.
in
other
words,
what
you
aren't
to
do
is
to
look
at
good
old
mrs.
smith
who
has
really
suffered
terribly,
she
happens
not
to
be
in
court,
think
about
her
suffering,
which
is
real
and
serious,
and
then
say
i'm
going
to
punish
this
defendant
because
of
what
he
did
to
her.
which
would
be
a
natural
human
reaction,
and
perhaps
admirable,
but
regardless,
the
law
is
that
that's
what
you're
not
supposed
to
do.
so
reading
it
as
i
just
read
it
naturally,
it
seems
to
describe
what
our
cases
have
said
is
the
law.
why
isn't
that
right?
i'm
looking
for
a
real
answer
to
the
question.
i'm
posing
it
in
a
hostile
way
and
hope
i'll
get
an
answer.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
read
it's
about
harm.
you
say
look
here
is
the
person
doing
something
absolutely
awful,
i
mean
really
awful.
and
look
at
how
awful
it
is.
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
have
hurt
x
number
of
people
badly,
maybe
kill
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
think
we
all
agree
that
that's
an
appropriate
thing
to
say.
and
as
long
as
you
can
say
that
why
can't
you
create
serious
damages
for
that
type
of
conduct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trouble
with
the
more
basic
question,
i
don't
know
if
you
can
answer
it,
but
it
is
a
problem,
that
when
i...
most
states
have
factors
like
that,
or
many
do.
alabama
did.
you
know,
not
quite
as
good
as
that,
and
we
saw
the
patent
fraud,
you
know.
and
there
are
other
cases
that
would
bring
up
products
liability.
and
it's
pretty
hard
to
think
of
a
products
liability
case
where
the
jury
found
negligence,
where
they
might
not
also
find
these
factors.
because
in
a
typical
case,
you'll
get
competing
memos
within
the
company.
somebody
will
have
been
hurt
and
likely
seriously,
and
when
you
start
thinking
about
the
victim
in
front
of
you,
it
all
looks
pretty
bad,
and
it
often
is,
at
least
in
this
instance.
and
now
you
read
these
five
factors,
and
the
difficulty
for
me
has
always
been,
well,
you
read
the
jury
factors
like
that
and
they
can
do
almost
anything.
and
it's
that,
it's
that
fact
that
anything
goes
that
i
found
disturbing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
focuses
upon
punitive
damages
that
were
awarded
to
the
state
of
a
heavy
smoker
jesse
williams
who
died
of
a
smoking
related
disease.
an
oregon
jury
found
that
the
cigarette
company
phillip
morris
had
engaged
in
deceit
that
led
to
williams’s
death.
it
awarded
the
state
about
$800,000
in
compensatory
damages
and
it
then
assessed
punitive
damages
of
$80
million
which
is
about
a
100
times
of
compensatory
damages
reward.
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
damages
award
punitive
part
was
excessive
and
he
reduced
that
amount
from
$80
million
to
$32
million.
but
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
overturned
the
trial
court
on
this
point
and
it
restored
the
full
$80
million,
the
oregon
supreme
court
then
affirmed
that
and
we
agree
that
we
would
review
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
determination.
now
philip
morris
makes
two
arguments
in
front
of
us,
the
first
focuses
upon
statements
that
williams’
lawyer
made
when
he
asked
the
jury
to
consider
harmed
cause
other
smokers
in
oregon
people
other
than
williams
and
in
particular
he
was
talking
about
individuals
in
oregon
whom
philip
morris’
cigarettes
might
have
killed.
philip
morris
asked
the
trial
judge
in
light
of
these
statements
to
tell
the
jury
in
an
instruction
that
although
the
jury
could
take
account
of
the
harm
that
these
cigarettes
caused
other
smokers
when
it
considered
the
reasonableness
of
the
relationship
between
philip
morris’
conduct
and
the
williams’
harm.
it
could
not
the
jury
could
not
consider
the
harm
caused
to
other
smokers’
in
order
to
using
philip
morris
or
in
order
to
punish
the
defendant
for
the
impact
of
its
alleged
misconduct
on
other
persons
who
may
bring
lawsuits
of
their
own
in
which
other
juries
can
resolve
their
claims.
the
trial
judge
did
not
give
this
proposed
instruction,
the
oregon
supreme
court
ultimately
upheld
the
trial
judge.
the
oregon
supreme
court
said
“well
if
a
jury
cannot
punish
then
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
it
could
consider
the
harm
caused
to
other
people
at
all”
and
philip
morris
argues
that
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
view
of
the
matter
was
constitutionally
mistaken.
philip
morris
says
first
that
the
due
process
clause
forbids
punishing
a
defendant
in
a
particular
case
for
harm
caused
other
people
that
are
not
before
the
court
in
that
case
and
then
philip
morris
point
second
to
other
cases
of
this
court
where
we
have
suggested
and
i
quote
from
one
of
them,
a
single
digit
multipliers
are
more
likely
to
comport
with
due
process
and
philip
morris
claims
that
the
award
a
100
times
the
amount
of
compensatory
damages
is
grossly
excessive
and
consequently
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
we
agree
with
philip
morris
in
respect
to
it’s
first
argument,
an
argument
that
in
our
view
focuses
upon
the
constitution’s
procedural
limitations.
we
note
that
the
due
process
clause
prohibits
a
state
from
punishing
an
individual
without
for
first
providing
that
individual
with
what
we
have
described,
these
are
our
words
in
other
cases.
an
opportunity
to
present
every
available
defense
to
the
charge,
a
defendant
threatened
with
punishment
for
injuring
a
person
who
is
not
before
the
court
has
no
opportunity
at
all
to
defend
against
that
charge.
moreover,
where
such
punishment
allowed
the
jury
would
inevitably
be
left
speculate
in
respect
to
a
host
of
details
highly
relevant
to
punishment
and
such
speculation
would
further
and
significantly
decrease
a
court’s
ability
to
control
the
size
of
punitive
damages
awards
through
the
use
of
specific
legal
standards.
we
agree
with
the
respondent
that
a
jury
can
consider
harm
to
others
when
it
considers
the
reprehensibility
of
the
defendant’s
conduct
but
we
think
there
is
an
important
difference
between
a
jury’s
considering
how
bad
that
conduct
is
i.e.
reprehensibility
and
the
jury’s
punishing
for
harm
to
others,
given
the
serious
risks
of
unfairness
that
can
arise
it
is
constitutionally
important
that
the
jury
when
deliberating
ask
the
right
question,
not
the
wrong
one.
we
therefore
hold
that
where
there
is
a
significant
risk
that
the
jury
when
awarding
punitive
damages
could
misunderstand
in
this
way,
how
it
may
take
account
of
harm
to
nonparties’
accord
upon
request
must
protect
against
that
risk.
for
these
and
for
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion
we
conclude
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
constitutional
standard
when
it
permitted
the
use
of
punitive
damages
to
punish
a
defendant
for
harm
caused
to
others
not
before
the
court.
we
consequently
vacate
the
oregon
supreme
court’s
judgment
and
we
remand
the
case
because
the
application
of
the
proper
standard
may
lead
to
a
change
in
the
level
of
the
punitive
damages
award
or
to
a
new
trial
we
shall
not
now
consider
philip
morris’
second
argument
namely
that
the
award
is
grossly
excessive.
