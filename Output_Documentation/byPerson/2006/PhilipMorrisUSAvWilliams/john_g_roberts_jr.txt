chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
philip
morris
v.
williams.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
when
you
do
that,
counsel,
aren't
you
punishing
the
defendant
for
the
harm
to
others?
you're
going
to
award
a
higher
multiple
with
respect
to
the
damages--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--based
on
the
conduct
to
others.
why
wouldn't
a
normal
juror
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--excuse
me.
why
wouldn't
a
normal
jury
view
that
as
punishing
the
defendant
for
the
harm
to
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frey,
i
suppose
your
theory
here
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
underlying
tort,
i
suppose,
in
that
there
are,
you
argue,
defenses
that
might
be
available
with
respect
to
other,
other
individuals
who
are
harmed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
argument
wouldn't
apply
in
a
case
if
the
underlying
tort
weren't
susceptible
to
those
sorts
of
defenses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
mr.
peck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
object
to
in
this
instruction.
i
mean,
and
i
thought
our
cases
clearly
established
that
you
can
consider
the
harm
to
others
in
assessing
the
reprehensible
nature
of
the
conduct.
you
don't
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
you
cannot...
on
the
other
hand
you
cannot
punish
the
defendant
for
those
harms
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
might
have
defenses
available
with
respect
to
those
others.
so
i
understood
what
the
instruction
sought
to
do
is
simply
try
to
draw,
it's
a
fine
line
but
the
reason
it's
a
fine
line
is
because
of
our
prior
cases,
and
it
tried
to
draw
that
distinction
between
assessing
reprehensibility
and
punishing
for
harm
to
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
because
the
instructions
indicate
and
juries
often
do
this
that
punitive
damages
are
certain
multiple
of
the
compensatory
damages,
and
therefore
that's
what
they
are
saying.
in
determining
what
that
multiple
should
be
you
consider
whether
they
have
harmed
others.
and
this
instruction
would
make
all
the
difference
to
the
world
in
terms
of
what
lawyers
are
going
to
be
arguing
about.
if
you're
allowed
to
punish
for
harm
to
others,
you
say,
well,
there
is
however
many,
a
thousand
other
people
in
the
plaintiff's
position,
so
a
thousand
times
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
conduct
is
a
thousand
times
more
reprehensible.
there
is
a
more,
there
is
a
more
natural
limit
on
the
multiple
when
you
get
this
kind
of
instruction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
way
to
look
at
what
it
meant
is
what
you
argued
below,
i'm
looking
at
the
joint
appendix
page
199(a),
the
plaintiff's
counsel
in
oregon
to
the
jury:
"how
many
people
do
you
see
outside
driving
home
smoking
cigarettes?
"
now,
that
type
of
argument
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
assess
reprehensibility.
on
the
other
hand,
with
the
instruction
that
was
offered
the
defense
counsel
could
have
warned
the
jury
keep
in
mind
you
can't
punish
for
those
other
people.
we
only
have
one
plaintiff
before
us
and
we
are
assessing
the
reprehensibility
with
respect
to
that
plaintiff.
but
without
the
instruction
you're
allowed
to
argue
how
many
people
do
you
see
in
oregon
smoking
cigarettes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
has
no--
relevance
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
the
defendant
is
being
punished,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
they
can
understand
that
distinction,
why
wasn't
the
defense
counsel
entitled
to
argue
to
the
jury
just
as
you
argued,
you
can
consider
the
harm
to
others
in
assessing
reprehensibility,
why
couldn't
the
defense
counsel
say,
but,
you
can't
punish
for
the
harm
to
others,
if
as
you
answered
to
justice
alito,
a
jury
can
understand
that
distinction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it
would
have
been,
putting
aside
what
they
proposed,
if
they
had
proposed
an
instruction
that
said,
you
may
consider
the
harm
to
others
in
assessing
how
reprehensible
the
conduct
is
but
you
may
not
punish
philip
morris
for
the
harm
to
others,
you
would
have
had
no
objection
to
that
instruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
make,
just
to
get
the
ground
rules
here,
you're
not
asking
us
to
reconsider
either
state
farm,
bmw,
any
of
our
punitive
damages
precedents?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
peck.
mr.
frey,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
in
05-1256,
philip
morris
versus
williams.
