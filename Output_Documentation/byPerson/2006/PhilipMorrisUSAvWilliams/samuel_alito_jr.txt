cannot

for
the

you
think
juries
can,
oregon
juries
or
juries
anywhere
can
understand
what
they
are
told

can
take
into
account
conduct
directed
at
other
people
for
the
purpose

assessing
how
reprehensible
the
conduct
is,

you
can't
punish
for
the
harm
that
is
caused
other
people?

them
apply
that
principle
in
this
case?
