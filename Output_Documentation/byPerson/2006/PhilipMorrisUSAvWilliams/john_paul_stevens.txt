justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
frey,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
this
was
a
criminal
case
and
the
defendant
was
being
punished
for
crime
a
and
the
judge
in
working
out
the
sentence
realizes
he
also
committed
crimes
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
he
could
take
those
into
account
in
determining
the
extent
of
the
sentence
given
for
crime
a.
why
isn't
that
similar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
was
a
second...
the
same
defendant
got
convicted
again
for
crime
x.
at
that
sentencing
the
judge
could
again
take
into
account
the
harm
to
defendants
b,
c,
and
d.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
same
harm
if
it's
a
different
defendant
or
a
different
plaintiff
in
the
second
case.
you're
punishing
him
for
the
harm
to
be
this
time,
and
you
can...
just
as
in
a
criminal
case,
why
can't
you
in
both
cases
take
into
account
that,
the
harm
to
the
class,
to
the
public
at
large?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
actual
harm
to
others
and
the
risk
of
harm?
supposing
a
defendant
fired
a
machine
gun
into
a
crowd
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
killed
one,
at
least
one.
and
that
one
sued
and
said:
i
want
extra
punitive
damages
because
all
these
other
people
were
subjected
to
the
same
risk.
wouldn't
that
be
a
proper
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
proper
consideration
even
if
a
second
person
brought
the
same
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
not
asking
to
recover
for
the
actual
harm
to
the
others.
you're
saying
there
was
a
general
risk
of
harm
to
many,
many
people,
which
is
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
we
don't
know
whether
they're
harmed
or
not,
but
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
fixing
the
ultimate
verdict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
time
to
determine
what
to
do
with
the
second
lawsuit
is
when
the
second
lawsuit
is
brought?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can't
i
punish
for
the
risk
of
harm
to
b,
c,
and
d?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
assuming
there's
a
distinction,
and
the
instruction
does,
between
taking
into
account
the
extent
of
harm
to
others
on
the
one
hand
and
punishing
for
the
extent
of
harm
on
the
other.
as
i
understand
what
you
recited
about
the
five
parts
of
the
instructions,
none
of
them
really
authorized
punishment
for
harm
to
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
also
true
that
the
part
the
chief
justice
quoted
from
199(a),
it
seems
to
me
that
could
be
an
argument
that
you
should
take
into
account
the
extent
of
harm
to
others,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
an
argument
that
you
can
punish
on.
and
the
question
i
want
to
ask,
are
there
other
parts
of
the
closing
argument
in
which
plaintiff's
counsel
argued
that
you
should
take
into
account,
that
you
should
punish
for
harm
to
others?
