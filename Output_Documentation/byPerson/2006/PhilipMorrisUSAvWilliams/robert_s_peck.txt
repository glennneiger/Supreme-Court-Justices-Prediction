mr.
robert
s.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
start
with
the
proposed
instruction
because
that
is
where
philip
morris
began
and
the
oregon
courts
properly
treated
that
as
an
enigma.
it
told
the
jury,
it
would
have
told
the
jury,
both
that
they
could
consider
the
extent
of
harm
and
not
consider
the
extent
of
harm
with
respect
to
a
reasonable
relationship.
that's
the
disparity
guide
post.
clearly,
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
said.
and
what,
it's
not
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
did.
it's
also
significant
if
you
look
at
the
actual
proposed
instruction,
which
is,
starts
on
page
240,
279(a)
of
the
joint
appendix,
the,
the
proposed
instruction
says
you
may
consider
whether
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
is
necessary
to
punish
and
deter
similar
misconduct
by
defendant
and
others
in
the
future.
now,
that's
part
of
a
calculation
that
considers
harm
to
others
in
the
future
as
a
potential
harm.
so
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
discussed
when
it
said
that
this
does
not
reflect
our
law.
it's
also
significant
that
they
said
that
you
could
consider
financial
condition
and
you
cannot
consider
financial
condition
which
is
part
of
the
oregon
statute.
now
philip
morris
in
their
reply
brief
says
that
we
have
conflated
an
alternative
instruction
with
one
that
they
offered
but
if
you
look
at
page
280(a)--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
instruction--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
instruction
basically
advises
the
jury
to
do
precisely
what
philip
morris
argues
before
this
court
it
cannot
do
and
that
is
to
take
into
account
the
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
this
disparity.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
we
don't
disagree
with
that
and
that's
precisely
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
did.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
we
submit
that
it
was
unsuccessful
in
conveying
properly
what
this
court
has
held
and
that
is
sufficient
grounds
for
the
oregon
supreme
court
to
uphold
the
trial
court's
decision.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
justice
scalia,
if
that--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--leaving
that
out
made
it
erroneous
because
it
said,
not
with
respect
to
reprehensibility
analysis
but
with
respect
to
reasonable
relationship.
that
was
erroneous.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
let
me
take
a
step
back
because
i
think
there
is
a
confusion
here
over
also
the
word
punishment.
punitive
damages
do
not
punish
for
harm,
they
punish
misconduct.
and
this
is
an
important
distinction
because
harm
is
a
compensatory
concept.
you
compensate
others
for
harm
and
of
course
you
cannot
compensate
others
for
harm
in
the
course
of
this
case.
but
you
can
consider
the
potential
risks,
the
potential
harm
and
the
future
harm
if
this
course
of
misconduct
is
not
deterred.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
no,
i'm
saying--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
instruction--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
instruction
as
the
oregon
supreme
court
said,
you
know,
doesn't
provide
the
clarity
that
philip
morris
hoped
to
provide
to
the
jury.
and
it
says
and
they
can't
see
how
this
summarizes
philip
morris'
interpretation
of
campbell.
that's
in
footnote
3
of
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
justice
breyer,
if
the
instruction
had
been
given
the
way
you
have
just
stated
it
we
would
have--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--had
no
problems.
but
it's
not
how
it
reads.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
and
it's
not
what
it
does.
it
starts
out
saying
that
reasonable
relationship
is
about
the
harm
to
jesse
williams
and
then
it
says
you
may
consider
the
harm
suffered
by
others
in
determining
that
reasonable
relationship.
well,
how
does
harm
to
others
help
you
figure
out
what
the
relationship
to
jesse
williams
is?
it
doesn't
compute.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
but,
but
juries
don't
look
at
punitive
damages
in
terms
of
a
multiple.
they
are
not
asked
to
multiply
anything
and
they
shouldn't
be.
they
are
looking
at
the
misconduct.
they
are
looking
at
how
you
deter
others
from
similar
misconduct.
they
are
looking
at
profitability
here
which
is
a
statutory
requirement
to
them.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
earlier,
the
citations
that
they
have
used
in
their
brief
are
to
the
characterization
of
philip
morris'
argument.
but
if
you
look
at
30(a)
in
the
petition...
and
that
second
paragraph
there
starts
out
with
"using
harm
to
others
as
part
of
the
ratio
may
have
been
correct
under
the
plurality
opinion
in
txo.
"
--and
then
you
jump
down
to,
"however,
it
no
longer
appears
to
be
permissible
if
it
ever
was.
"
mr.
robert
s.
peck
and
that's
because
of
the
nature
of
this
conduct.
this
is
not
conduct
that
was
directed
at
jesse
williams
and
he
was
the
sole
recipient
of
what
philip
morris
did
here.
this
was
a
massive
market
directed
fraud
driven
by
their
rational
and
deliberate
decisions
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
company
to
deceive
customers
and
knowingly
endanger
their
health.
they
knew
that
this
would
have
a
special
impact
on
those
who
are
highly
addicted,
as
jesse
williams
was.
and
so
this
is
the
misconduct
that
oregon
is
seeking
to
deter.
and
how
is
a
state,
given
the
considerable
flexibility
that
this
court
has
recognized,
going
to
deter
that
kind
of
misconduct
if
instead
society's
interest
has
to
be
fractionalized
on
an
individual
case-by-case
basis
knowing
that
the
majority
of
those
cases
will
never
take
place
and
in
fact
in
oregon
will
not?
mr.
robert
s.
peck
right.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
that
is
precisely
what
we
believe
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
here.
when
it
talked
about
how
highly
reprehensible
this
was,
extraordinary
by
any
measure,
it
said
those
concerns
override
ratio
by
which
they
meant
single
digit
ratios.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
believe,
justice
souter
that
what
the
court
was
doing
there
which
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
analysis
below
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
was
to
talk
about
the
prospective
future
victims
of
this
fraud,
that
if
it
were
not
deterred
which
is
a
consideration
that
the
oregon
statute
makes
clear,
if
it
was
not
deterred
then
this
kind
of
consideration
for
the
same
acts
having
the
same
effect
on
others
then
doesn't
allow
you
to
make
sure
that
on
that
scale
that
this
is
at
the
high
end
of
what
we
are--
justice
souter:
that's
a,
that's
a,
i
will
assume
that's
a
legitimate
reading
in
your
favor.
but
the
answer,
i
mean,
i
think
the
response
has
to
be
after
listening
to
you,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
what
they
really
had
in
mind
here.
and
if,
if
i
really
can't
figure
out
what
they
had
in
mind,
and
if
i
go
back
to
the
footnote
that
justice
alito
mentioned
before,
isn't
perhaps
the
better,
the
better
course
to
send
this
back
to
them
and
say,
"we
don't
know
what
you
mean.
"
"were
you
saying
you
can
punish
for
these
others
as
distinct
from
considering
risk
to
others
for,
on
reprehensibility?
"
and
let
them
tell
us
clearly.
isn't
that
the
better
course?
well,
you
know,
perhaps
that's
one
way
to
determine
what
the
court
meant.
but
i
would
suggest--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--let
me
suggest
that
both
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
the
instructions
that
were
actually
given
to
the
jury
helped
answer
this
by
looking
at
the
statutory
criteria.
oregon
has
taken
extraordinary
steps
since
this
court's
decision
in
oberg
to
enact
a
statute
that
guides
the
courts
on
the,
guides
the
juries
and
the
courts
in
the
assessment
of
punitive
damages.
you
know,
first
there
is
a
threshold.
before
you
can
even
plead
punitive
damages
you
must
meet
that
threshold
and
you
must
demonstrate
to
the
court
by
admissible
evidence
that
there
was
a
reckless
and
outrageous
indifference
to
a
highly
unreasonable
risk
of
harm,
that
they've
acted
with
a
conscious
indifference
to
the
health
and
safety
and
welfare
of
others.
now,
this
is
part
of
what
infuses
it
with
public
purpose.
then--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--60
percent
of
an
award
by
statute
goes
to
a
crime
victims
fund
of
the
state
of
oregon
and
as
soon
as
the
judgment
is
rendered
then
the
state
becomes
a
judgment
creditor.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
no,
but
the
statutory
criteria
which
requires
that
the
jury
find
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
the
following
factors,
which
was
given
to
this
jury
in
the
fashion
that
i'm
about
to
tell
you,
constrains
this
award
and
i
think
properly
makes
it
reasonable.
first,
you
have
to
consider
whether
there
is
a
likelihood
that
serious
harm
would
arise
from
the
defendant's
misconduct.
second,
the
degree
of
the
defendant's
awareness
of
that
likelihood.
three,
profitability
in
the
state
of
oregon.
four,
duration
of
the
misconduct
and
concealment
of
it.
five,
the
attitude
and
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
upon
discovery
of
the
misconduct.
and
then
finally,
financial
condition
of
the
defendant,
which
cuts
both
ways.
it
protects
a
defendant
from
being
bankrupted
by
punitive
damages
while
at
the
same
time
assures
that
punitive
damages
are
enough
to
have
that
deterrent
effect.
now
even
after
that,
the
defendant
could
opt
to
have
the
jury
address
whether
they
had
been
previously
punished
for
this
misconduct
or
choose
not
to,
which
you
would
expect
most
defendants
to
choose,
and
instead
post
verdict,
present
that
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
but
this
last
factor
that
i
was
about
to
get
to,
which
i
think
provides
a
constraint
that's
unlike
the
ones
that
you've
seen
in
other
cases,
and
that
is
the
total
deterrent
effect
of
other
punishment
imposed
in
any
remedial
measures
the
defendant
has
taken.
now
this
can
be
presented
first
to
the
trial
judge,
saying
okay,
we
have
this
huge
award,
but,
you
know,
we
have
been
fined
by
the
government,
we
have
had
punitive
damages
assessed
against
us
in
other
cases,
and
as
a
result
we
have
taken
the
following
measures
which
assure
that
we
will
not
engage
in
this
kind
of
misconduct
again,
and
as
a
result
also,
this
award
should
be
cut.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
the
jury
does
not.
you
have
the
option
of
presenting
it
to
the
jury
but
you
do
not
have
to
present
it
to
the
jury.
you
can
present
it
first
to
the
trial
judge
and
you
can
also
present
it
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
would
suggest
it's
not
irrational
because
what
you
do
is,
you've
given
the
defendant
the
option
as
a
strategic
matter
either
to
present
it
to
the
jury
or
if
they
think
that
will
guarantee
an
award
of
punitive
damages
against
them,
they
can
withhold
it
and
present
it
only
to
the
trial
judge.
this
is
a
protection
to
the
defendant
rather
than,
you
know,
an
oddity,
i
think.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--there
is
not.
the
only
argument
that
was
made
in
closing
was
that
you
can
think
about
the
others,
which
was
clearly
intended
to
go
towards
that
reprehensibility
analysis.
you
know,
certainly
in
the
criminal
law
context,
an
attempted
crime
is
punished
as
badly
as
an
actual
crime
when
all
the
elements
that
are
required
to,
to
accomplish
that
crime
have
occurred.
and
in
the
context
of
this
very
unusual
long
in
duration
misconduct,
what
you
had
to
do
was
you
had
to
look
at
that
broad
attempt
to
effect
oregon--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
believe
they
can.
this...
this
jury
did
a
very
good
job.
first
of
all,
if
they--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
believe
they
can.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
they
understood
contributory
or
comparative
negligence,
and
gave
no
award
on
the
basis
of
negligence.
they
made
a
distinction
in,
in
the
fraud
claim
by
only
awarding
a
little
bit
more
than
$21,000,
even
though
the
request
was
much
higher.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
believe
the
defense
counsel
would
have
been
entitled
to
make
such
an
argument.
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
need
for
corrective
instruction.
but
what
they
proposed,
which
was
conflicting
in
two
different
respects,
just
did
not
meet
the
muster.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
would
have
had
no
objection.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
think
it
was
critical
and
of
course,
you
know,
oregon
is
entitled
to
run
its
court--
system
as
it
has
for
more
than
30
years.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
why
was
it
corrected?
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
the
answer
is
because,
again,
it
was
not
directed
for
the
specific
purpose
for
which
harm
to
others
may
be
considered,
and
that's
in
the
reprehensibility
analysis.
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
parties
on
that.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
but
what
this
instruction
told
him--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
what
the
instruction
told
them
is
to
consider
it
with
respect
to
the
reasonable
relationship.
that
means
the
ratio.
that
means
proportionality.
and
that
would
suggest,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
that
they
might
multiply
it
by
how
many
people
are
out
there,
because
i
think
this
instruction
was
an
enigma
and
was
confusing.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
you
know,
perhaps
so.
but
you
know,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
you
know,
we
did
not
advocate
that
the
jury
punish
for
harm
to
others.
we
do
not
believe
the
oregon
court
upheld
this
judgment
for
that
reason.
if
i
can
go
on
to
the,
some
of
the
other
points
that
are
made
by
philip
morris.
they
talk
about
this
court's
decision
in
state
farm
as
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
a
ratio,
so
they
reduce
the
decision
to
ratio.
they
transform
the
most
important
indicium,
reprehensibility,
into
a
subsidiary
role
in
the
ratio
analysis.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
no,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
do
that.
we
think
that
this,
this
judgment
is
valid
under
those
precedents.
they
denigrate
the
state's
interest
which
this
court
has
said
is
the
first
consideration,
the
state's
interest
in
deterrence
to
this
fractionalized
sort
of
passenger
on
each
individual
lawsuit,
even
though
the
state's
interest
here
when
we
get
to
the
punitive
damages
phase,
it's
infused
with
public
purpose,
that
state
interest
is
in
deterring
misconduct,
not
in
figuring
out
how
many
dollars
might
be
additionally
awarded
to
the
plaintiff
or
even
into
its
crime
victims
fund.
it
removes
the
state's
flexibility
and
ability
to
experiment
with
different
ways
to
address
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
stated
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
this
total
deterrent
effect
requirement
is
the
key
here,
that
this
is
a
part
of
a
state
statute
that
says
that
to
the
extent
that
there
had
been
prior
punitive
damage
awards
that
have
operated
to
affect
that
deterrence
that
the
state
is
interested
in,
to
the
effect
that
there
have
been
other
punishments,
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
remedial
measures
taken
to
prevent
such
misconduct
again
in
the
future,
then
the
judge
is
to
reduce
this
award.
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
said
that
this
fully
addresses
the
concern
with
multiple
awards,
duplicative
awards,
and
that
authoritative
construction
by
that
court
should,
should
weigh
heavily
with
this
court.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
mr.
robert

--well,
you
know--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
have
been,
they
have
lost
both,
the
only
two
cases
that
have
gone
to
a
trial
in
oregon.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
statute
of
ultimate
repose
practically
prevents
any
future
oregon
plaintiff
from
bringing
such
a
lawsuit.
they
would
have
to
show
that
they
contracted
cancer
or
a
disease
from
smoking
within
the
repose
period,
which
is
eight
years,
if
one
were
filed
tomorrow,
eight
years
ago,
and
that
indeed
that
the
fraud
was
a
substantial
factor
in
contracting
that
disease.
that
is
what
we
were
put
to
prove
in
this
case,
the
relevant
date
being
1988.
now
imagine,
that
window
is
rapidly
closing
on
eight
years,
because
it
was
after
this
case
that
philip
morris
decided
that
they
were
no
longer
going
to
deny
that
smoking
causes
cancer
and
they
were
no
longer
going
to
deny
that
nicotine
was
addictive.
so
that
window
is
rapidly
closing,
and
it's
highly
unlikely
that
a
smoker
can
point
to
eight
years
ago
as
the
point
at
which
their
cancer
basically
became
active.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
going
to
be
no
awards,
future
awards
in
oregon.
and
as
a
legal
matter,
doctrinal
matter,
i
believe
that
oregon
has
taken
the
step
necessary
to
prevent
multiple
awards.
you
know,
six
states
do
not
permit
punitive
damages
in
most
instances.
another
20
or
so
cap
punitive
damages.
and
then
12,
of
which
oregon
is
one,
has
chosen
a
method
like
this
to
address
that
duplicative
award
approach.
i
think
that
kind
of
experimentation
which
is
done
in
good
faith,
which
has
been
authoritatively
construed
by
the
courts
to
address
this
question,
is
sufficient
to
address
any
concerns
with
due
process.
but
let's,
let's
remember
also,
that
while
the
constitution
contains
many
places
where
numbers
are
important,
the
president
must
be
35
years
of
age,
it
has
implied
in
other
places
numbers,
like
in
one
person,
one
vote.
but
the
due
process
clause
in
its
spaciousness
and
majesty
doesn't
talk
about
numbers,
and
that
is
where
the
concern
is
only
about
reasonableness.
it's
about
fairness.
and
here
the
oregon
legislature,
supplemented
by
the
oregon
courts,
have
taken
those
steps
to
properly
constrain
awards.
since
the
decision
in
oberg,
there
have
been
only
14
punitive
damage
decisions
in
oregon.
four
of
them
have
been
overturned
entirely
by
the
oregon
supreme
court,
so
no
punitive
damages
awarded.
there
are
only
two
out
of
all
those
awards
that
exceed
single
digits,
and
this
is
one
of
them.
so
i
think
that
the
courts
have
done
a
good
job
there
of
trying
to
address
these
concerns.
and
one
of
the
areas
of
agreement
between
our
opponents
and
us
is
that
the
statement
in
their
brief
that,
reprehensibility
ensures
that
the
greater
wrong
receives
the
greater
punishment.
but
the
regime
that
they
are
suggesting,
one
that
has
a
categorical
ratio
limit
and
atomizes
this
kind
of
consideration
so
you
don't
look
at
the
broader
societal
and
public
purpose,
that
one
guarantees
a
regime
of
underdeterrence.
and
oregon
has,
as
it
is
their
right,
opted
for
optimal
deterrent
effect.
thank
you.
