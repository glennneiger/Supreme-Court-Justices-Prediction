in
that
respect,
how
does
the...
there
may
not
be
a
definitive
authority
by
this.
oregon
says
that
if
a
corporation
commits
manslaughter
it's
required
to
pay
up
to
twice
the
amount
the
corporation
gained
by
committing
the
offense--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
my
understanding.
suppose
a
corporation
in
a
hypothetical
case
commits
five
manslaughters.
would
they
be
liable...
and
gained
for
$1
million.
would
they
be
liable
for
twice
a
million
dollars
in
every
manslaughter
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
say
this
after
the
fact?
the
jury
doesn't
hear
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
very
odd
that
a
major
argument
for
constraint
is
something
that
the
jury
can't
hear.
it
just
goes
to
show,
really,
the
irrational
nature
of
the
exercise.
