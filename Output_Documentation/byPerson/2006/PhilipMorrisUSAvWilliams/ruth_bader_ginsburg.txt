mr.
frey,
are
you
talking
about
what
is
numbered,
is
it
number
34?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
don't
think
that
would
confuse
the
jury
if
they
are
first
told
that
they
may
consider
the
extent
of
harm
suffered
by
others,
and
then
the
next
instruction
seems
to
say
they
can't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
oregon
supreme
court
say
it
was
proper
to
punish
for
harm
to
nonparties?
your
brief
quotes
something
to
that
effect,
but...
the
sentence
on
page
18(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
it
says,
what
the
oregon
court
said
is,
philip
morris
asserts
that
campbell
prohibits
the
state
acting
through
a
civil
jury
from
using
punitive
damages
to
punish
a
defendant
for
harm
to
nonparties.
the
oregon
supreme
court
on
its
own,
i
think,
didn't
put
it
in
terms
of
harming
particular
nonparties,
but
to
exposing
oregon
residents
to
the
risk
of
a
deadly
disease.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
frey,
we
don't
know
what
oregon
law
is
on
that
point.
they
do
have
a
law
that
the
oregon
court
thought
meant
that
they
must
adjust
in
the
next
case.
and
how
would
you
deal...
would
it
be
different
if
oregon,
as
many
states,
said
part
of
that
punitive
award
goes
not
to
the
plaintiff,
but
to
some
state
fund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
law
in
oregon
were,
plaintiff
number
two,
you
don't
get
punitive
damages
or
you
can
get
only
the
difference
between
what
the
jury
awarded
you
and
what
philip
morris
has
already
paid
out
in
punitive
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
know
what
it
is.
we
haven't
had
the
second
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
part
of
this
award,
at
least
according
to
the
trial...
there's
a
footnote
referring
to
an
oregon
statute
that
provides
for
the
distribution
of
punitive
damages
between
prevailing
parties
and
the
state
of
oregon.
is...
was
this
award
shared?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
state
law
provides
that
part
of
the
recovery
goes
to
the
state,
then
at
least
as
to
the
part
that
goes
to
the
state
you
can
say,
well
the
state
has
recovered
and
you
can't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then
you
can
object
in
the
next
case
if
you're
subjected
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no,
i
mean
when
you
lose
the
case
on
the
merits
and
there's
a
determination
of
damages,
oregon
says,
we
adjust
for
having
a
prior
award.
we
don't
know
what
that
adjustment
will
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
you
what
is
the
division?
how
much
of
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
depends
when
you
say
something
about
duplicative
recoveries,
because
that
seems
to
be
a
major
concern.
