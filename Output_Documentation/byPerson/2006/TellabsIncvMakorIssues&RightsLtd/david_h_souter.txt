justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
difference
between
matsushita
and
this
particular
case
at
least
as
you
are
presenting
this
case,
the...
the...
focused
on
the
strength
of
this
exclusion
of
innocent
conduct?
as,
as
i
recall
matsushita,
there...
there
had
to
be
at
that
stage,
there
had
to
be
evidence
from
which
one
could
infer
that
the...
that
the
conduct
was
not
innocent;
but
you're
arguing
for
something
stronger
than
that.
you're
arguing
for,
in
effect,
an...
an
ultimate
conclusion
that
excludes
innocent
conduct.
and
aren't
you
asking
for
more
than
just
what
matsushita
did
at...
at
that
later
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
matsushita
as
i
recall
did
not
require
it
to
rise
beyond
the
level
of
a
plausible
inference.
and
i
think
you're
arguing
for
something
stronger
than
that.
and
i
think
the
language
of
congress
forces
you
to
do
it
but
i...
i'm
just
finding
it
difficult
to
conclude...
to
equate
the
plausibility
standard
in,
in
matsushita
with
the
strong
inference
standard
here.
if
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
we
simply
assume
that
the
read
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
rule
is
still
in
place,
but
that
reading
it
most
favorably
to
the
plaintiff,
it
must
rise
to
the
level
of
supporting
the
strong
inference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
was
using
the
word
inference
to...
to
refer
to
some
reasoning
process
based
upon
what
is
stated.
not
on
assumptions
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
and
if
inference
is
to
tie...
is,
is
a
term
that
is
tied
to
what
is
alleged,
then
i
don't
see
any...
any
contradiction
between
reading
those
allegations
most
favorably,
but
saying
the
statute
in
each
statute
requires
that
the...
that
the
total
force
of
the
inference
rise
to
the
level
of
strength
that
you
speak
of.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
entitled
to
consider
the
brush
strokes
that
are
not
there
as
well
as
the
subsidiary
brush
strokes
that
are?
in
justice
alito's
example,
if
the
pleadings
don't
point
out
that
the
library
of
congress
and
the
capitol
are
also
up
on
this
hill,
is
the
judge
at
the
motions
stage
entitled
to
consider
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
that
is
engaging
in
something
more
than
construing
the
pleadings
most
favorably
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
are
at
least
some
circumstances,
then,
in
which
there
this
is
kind
of
critical
assessment
function
that
you
concede
must
go
on,
rather
than
simply
a
piling
favorable
inference
onto
favorable
inference
to
see
if
it
gets
to
the
strong
points.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is...
that
is
an
argument
for
the
weight
of
considering
motive
rather
than
the
relevance
of
the
motive
consideration
per
se.
