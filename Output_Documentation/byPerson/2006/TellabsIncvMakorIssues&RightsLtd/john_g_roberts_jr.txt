g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-484,
tellabs,
inc.
versus
makor
issues
&
rights.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
phillips.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
a
position
on
justice
alito's
earlier
question
about
whether
the
standard
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
is
the
same
as
the
standard
at
the
pleading
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
shanmugam.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
arguing
the
facts
and
the
inferences.
you
said
the
seventh
circuit
got
it
right.
as
i
read
their
articulation
of
the
standard
on
page
20a
of
the
petition
appendix,
it's
the
normal
standard
that
would
have
been
applied
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
pslra.
could
a
reasonable
person
infer...
congress
passes
a
law
saying
they've
got
to
give
rise
to
a
strong
inference.
shouldn't
that
have
changed
the
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
seventh
amendment
argument
here.
congress
can
surely
articulate
the
standard
that's
going
to
be
applied
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
if
congress
says,
you
have
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
doesn't
interfere
with
the
seventh
amendment
because
a
jury
would
be
instructed
pursuant
to
that
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
that
congress
could
set
a
high
level
of
burden
on
factual
issues,
and
that
that
wouldn't
intrude
upon
the
seventh
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
congress
can
not
set
a
fact
burden
on
the
merits
that
is
different
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i'm
with
you
so
far,
why
would
you
suppose
that
congress
would
create
a
different
standard
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
than
they
meant
to
apply
at
the
merits
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
what
was
congress
trying
to
do
when
they
said
strong
inference?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
think
the
standards
have
to
be
the
same
at
pleading
and
at
proof,
and
congress
says
strong
inference
at
pleading,
it
means
you
have
to
show
a
strong
inference
at
proof,
and
that's
why
there's
no
seventh
amendment
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
all
of
those
cases
were
before
the
pslra
where
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
established
a
very
different
standard.
they
said
they
have
to
support
a
strong
inference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
strong
inference
was
not
the
test
that
was
being
applied
in
anderson,
liberty
lobby,
in
any
of
those
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
change
how
we
should
read
strong
inference
in
the
statute?
are
you
saying
don't
worry
whether
it's
a
strong
inference
or
not
because
labor
unions
are
bringing
the
cases
and
they're
not
going
to
bring
a
frivolous
case?
no.
congress
said
there
has
to
be
a
strong
inference.
and
what
concerns
me
is
that
the
very
standard
that
the
seventh
circuit
articulated
said
simply
could
a
reasonable
person
infer.
the
notion
of
strong
inference
isn't
in
that
standard
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
you
two
are
even
now.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
trial
worthy
under
preponderance
standard
or
trial
worthy
under
the
strong
inference
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens,
say
it
again.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
06-484,
tellabs
incorporated
versus
makor
issues
and
rights,
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion.
