justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
it
says,
which
i
think
it
did
say,
that
mr.
notebaert
typically
stayed
on
top
of
the
company's
financial
health
by
having
weekly
conversations
with
other
executives.
he
had
his
hands
on
the
pulse
of
the
company.
he
saw
weekly
sales
reports
and
product...
projection...
production
projections.
now
it
seems
like
an
allegation
that's
very
specific.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
they
alleged
at
least
that
for
about
a
year
previously
in
respect
to
the
506500
that
it
was
wrong
known
throughout
the
company
that
the
6500
had
been
delayed.
don't
they
make
an
allegation
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
6500
has
long
been
delayed.
everyone
knows
that
in
the
company.
so
he
knows
it's
long
been
delayed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
he
says
is
it
is
being
shipped
and
delivered.
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
april
'01,
he
says
everything
we
can
build
we
are
building,
and
shipping.
the
demand
is
very
strong.
and
then
what
they
say
is
of
course
nobody
wanted
any
of
it,
it
was
long
delayed,
and
they've
known
that
since
1998
and
he
has
his
finger
on
the
pulse
of
the
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
in
writing
this
opinion?
there
are
a
couple
of
ways.
one,
you
can
find
strong
inference
in
terms
of
some
other
words.
two,
you
could
look
to
history.
or
three,
you
could
just
try
an
example.
say
strong
inference
means
strong
inference.
here's
an
example.
this
is
a
complaint.
it
meets
it,
or
it
doesn't
meet
it.
which
way,
in
your
opinion,
will
work
best
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
had
something
else
to
say
in
answer
to
my
question,
which
i
would
like
to
hear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
most
suspicious
thing
in
the
complaint
that
i
could
find
was
where
you
say
there's
an
internal
market
report,
and
it
revealed
demand
for
the
5500
was
drying
up,
and
revenue
would
decline
by
400,000,000.
then
you
date
that
with
in
or
about
early
'01.
now,
i
think
if
you
knew
or
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
prior
to
march
or
april
of
'01,
you
would
have
said
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
and
therefore,
there's
quite
a
good
chance
here
that
this
report
was
written
after
he
made
the
statements.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
that?
i
mean,
i
know
what
you
said.
and
you
said
your
best.
and
that's
your
best.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference
between
what
justice
scalia
was
just
saying?
you
can't
come
into
federal
court
unless
you
have
at
least
$200,000
damages.
now,
you
might
have
been
just
as
much
hurt
if
you
had
less,
but
that
would
be
constitutional.
so
here
you
can't
get
into
federal
court
unless
you
have
a
really
strong
claim,
an
overwhelming
claim
that
you
have
to
demonstrate
at
the
beginning.
now,
you
might
have
a
good
claim,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
you
come
into
federal
court.
we
only
want
those
people
who
are
really
strong,
just
as
we
only
want
those
people
who
are
really
suffering.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
no,
not
the
burden
of...
it's
the
entry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
imagine
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
with
tremendous
candor
sets
forth
every
bit
of
testimony
that's
going
to
be
heard
on
both
sides.
and
then
you
read
that
document
and
you
conclude
this
is
the
weakest
case
i've
ever
heard,
but
i
do
think
a
reasonable
juror
could
find
for
the
plaintiff.
and
that
would
be
the
weak
evidence
standard.
and
lo
and
behold,
that
could
be...
you
know,
what
do
we
do
about
that?
because
using
your
do
you
send
it
to
a
jury
test,
we
could
easily
imagine
cases
where
that
meets
the
weak
evidence
standard,
the
weak
inference
and
not
the
strong
inference.
and
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
i
don't
see
a
way
of
avoiding
this
seventh
amendment
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
they
certainly
didn't
intend
the
weak
inference
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
the
approach...
because
i
have
had
some
of
these
cases.
and
i
see...
i
think
words,
words,
words.
and
what
congress
said
was
strong
inference,
and
we're
not
going
to
get
any
further
by
looking
for
some
other
words.
so
therefore,
take
strong
inference.
the
most
helpful
thing
is
take
it,
look
at
the
complaint,
read
it,
and
then
say
okay,
this
is
a
strong
inference.
or
maybe
we'd
say
it
isn't.
we
read
it,
and
avoid
all
the
other
issues.
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
and
so
i
think
we
have
to
reach
it,
because
it
can't
possibly
be
you
would
instruct
the
jury
you
need
a
strong
inference,
and
it
couldn't
possibly
be
that
a
predominance
standard
if
imported
into
the
pleading
would
always
mean
a
strong
inference.
you
see,
that's...
that's
the
dilemma.
and
i
don't
see
how
to
remain
true
to
the
words
of
the
statute
which
are
strong
inference,
without
actually
producing
a
dichotomy.
and
so
either
congress
can
do
it
or
it
can't,
and...
and...
and
that's...
and
we
could
fudge
it
by
just,
you
know,
avoiding
it
at
this
moment.
but
i
don't--
