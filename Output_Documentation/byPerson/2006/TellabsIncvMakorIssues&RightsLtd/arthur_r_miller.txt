mr.
arthur
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court?
we
believe
the
seventh
circuit
had
it
right.
we
believe
that
what
the
seventh
circuit,
and
this
is
in
partial
response
to
you,
justice
breyer,
is
take
more
or
less
a
holistic
view
of
the
entirety
of
the
complaint.
the
business
about
the
5500,
the
business
about
the
6500
not
being
available
when
on
december
11,
2000,
notebaert
says
it's
available,
the
fact
that
they
weren't
shipping
it,
they
weren't
selling
it,
it
didn't
work,
and
the
extensive
information
from
confidential
sources
that
there
were,
as
one
judge
once
referred
to
it,
accounting
shenanigans
going
on,
designed
to
shift
income
into
the
fourth
quarter
of
2000.
we
think
that
when
the
court
looked
at
that,
it
said,
looks
to
us
as
if
there's--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--again,
you
have
confidential
sources
in
this
case,
and
in
the
case,
notebaert
is
hands
on,
he's
talking
to
people,
he's
on
the
phone
all
the
time.
we're
talking
about
the
5500--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
would
think
you
should
be
able
to
infer
it
with
the
ceo.
i
think
the
confidential
sources
demonstrate
in
this
case,
he
must
have
had
it,
given
his
nature,
the
status
of
these
products,
his
day-to-day--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--if
we
knew.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes.
this
notion
of
strategic
ambiguity
is
in
a
sense
humorous,
given
the
obstacles
that
a
plaintiff
has
to
get
the
goods,
so
to
speak.
just
think
about
the
investigation
efforts
that
went
into
this
case.
what
you
do,
justice
breyer,
is...
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
did...
look
at
everything,
look
at
the
fact
that
you
have
got
confidential
sources
saying
5500
demand
is
drying
up,
perhaps
as
early
as
middle
2000.
parts
are
not
being
ordered.
people
are
going
home
early.
verizon
dropped
25
percent,
fourth
quarter.
verizon
dropped
50
percent
in
january.
you're
the
ceo.
you
don't
know
that
your
flagship
product
is
drying
up?
that
there's
inventory,
that
people
are
going
home?
that
your
best
customer
doesn't
know
you
anymore?
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
believe
two
propositions.
number
one,
you
can't
exceed
the
seventh
amendment,
and
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
correct,
chief
justice.
but
that
is
not
what
congress
did.
congress
did
not
elevate
the
burden
of
proof.
that
is
why
mr.
phillips
has
asked
you
to,
in
effect,
to
overrule
huddleston.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
indeed
rule
9(b)
has
been
an
entry
qualification
since
1938.
but
there
are
entry
qualifications,
and
there
are
entry
qualifications.
in
this
case,
in
effect,
the
motion
to
dismiss
operates
as
a
dispositive
motion.
it
cuts
off
the
ability
to
proceed
at
all,
and
it
does
it,
if
you
listen
to
the
standards
being
proposed
by
petitioner,
and
by
the
united
states--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--and
did
congress
raise
the
burden--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
entry
points
you
referred
to,
the
so-called
pleas
in
abatement,
to
put
on
my
common
law
hat,
a
jurisdiction
venue,
et
cetera,
they
may
raise
issues
of
fact
and
congress,
in
control
of
the
federal
courts,
can
calibrate
it
any
way
they
want.
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
core
function
of
the
jury...
and
matters
of
abatement
were
never
considered
to
be
core
functions
of
the
jury...
i
think
a
whole
range
of
cases
starting
with
slocum
versus
new
york
life--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i'm
distinguishing,
mr.
chief
justice,
between
the
merits
and
the
entry
point.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
if
congress
wants
to
change
preponderance
to
clear
and
convincing,
it
can.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
that
is
something
i
disagree
with.
if
the
substance
of
the
law--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i'm
not
sure
it's
the
rule.
it's
what
i
would
advocate.
if
the
substance
says
predominance,
then
to
raise
the
pleading
bar
on
what
in
effect
is
a
dispositive
motion...
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
a
jnov,
a
directed
verdict,
a
summary
judgment,
motion
for
judgment
on
the
opening
statement...
and
you
decided
all
of
those
cases.
and
you
protected
what
justice
souter
referred
to
in
markman
as
the
core
function
of
the
jury.
you
have
always
said
these
procedures
are
okay,
as
long
as
it
does
not
call
for
the
resolution
of
fact
issues,
because
that's
the
core
function
of
the
jury.
now
this
court
is
faced
with,
in
effect,
coming
back
down
that
time
line
to
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
don't
think
congress
would.
i
do
not
believe
congress
ever
intended...
it's
not
in
the
statute,
it
is
not
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
not
in
any
case,
matsushita,
monsanto
are
unique
antitrust
cases,
and
in
both
cases,
the
court,
if
you
read
the
opinions
fully,
protected
the
jury
function.
they
said
there
was
simply
nothing
beyond
the
assertions
standing
alone
when
you
have
competitive
and
anticompetitive
conduct
to
protect
substantive
antitrust
law.
that
doesn't
do
it.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
what
you
have
to
show
at
proof
is
preponderance.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
our
standard,
as
proposed,
and
we
think--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--is
reasonable
jurors,
who
are
finders
of
fact,
could
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendants
acted
with
scienter.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
you
can
have
lots
of
reasonable
inferences
that
don't
meet
a
preponderance
notion.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
if--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--if
you
follow
petitioners
in
their
attempt
to
deconstruct
not
simply
rule
8's
construction,
but
hundreds
of
years
of
what
this
court
in
jones
versus
bock
referred
to
as
usual
procedural
practices
which
are
not
to
be
lightly
departed
from,
the
historic
notion
is
you
look
at
the
complaint
and
in
a
curious
way,
you
have
blinders
on.
you
look
at
the
complaint.
you
read
it
in
the
light
favorable
to
the
pleader.
you
do
not
weigh.
that
is
a
jury
function.
you
do
not
look
for
exculpatory
explanations.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
as
the
seventh
circuit
did,
we
agree,
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
complaint.
that's
a
given.
but
there
are
contrary
inferences
that
undermine
the
strength
of
the
plaintiff's
inferences.
they
weaken
it.
and
they're...
they
emanate
from
the
complaint.
there
are
other
kinds
of
inferences,
let's
call
it
nonculpability,
that
don't
denigrate
the
strong
inference
which
let's
assume
hypothetically
has
been
established.
they're
just
side-bar
possibilities.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
seventh
circuit
reached
that
conclusion,
i
think,
by
looking
at
some
of
the
confidential
sources
which
sort
of
indicated
that
there
was
channel
stuffing
in
the
sense
of
pushing
product
out
which
was
coming
back.
the
head
of
verizon
complained
about
the
channel
stuffing,
so
there's
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
some
of
it
is
bad.
just
enough.
now,
is
that
in
and
of
itself
determinative?
no.
again,
i
come
back
to
the
notion
that
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
is
look
at
the
5500,
look
at
the
6500,
look
at
the
earnings
projections
which
proved
false,
looked
at
back-dating,
channel
stuffing.
looked
at
all
of
that
and
said
okay,
even
if
i
treat
channel
stuffing
as
weak,
i
have
these
other
things.
and
as
judge
lynch
of
the
first
circuit
said,
each
fact
of
scienter
is
like
a
brush
stroke.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
obviously,
if
it's
something
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of,
then
yes.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
but
it's
within
the
realm
of
what
courts
have
done
for
the
longest
of
the
time.
they
look
at
documents
attached.
they
look
at
judicial
notice.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
repeat
what
i
said
a
couple
of
minutes
ago,
justice
souter.
if
the
negative
depletes
the
affirmative,
if
there's
a
correlation
between
them,
i
can
understand
that.
maybe
it
eliminates
that
fact.
maybe
it
reduces
that
fact.
but
when
we
hear
about
motive,
what
does
motive
and
guidance
reduction
months
after
the
false
statements
have
to
do
with
whether
the
statements
were
false,
whether
the
5500
was--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
it
is
a
tough
line.
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
line
district
judges
have
to
draw.
i
think
if
you
look
at
your
own
precedents
like
anderson
versus
liberty
lobby
and
all
of
those
jury
trial
cases,
you
see
the
repetition
of
the
notion
that
judges
do
not
balance
inference
chains
on
a
matter
going
to
the
core
function
of
a
jury.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
a
strong
inference.
not
a
conclusive
inference.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
but
can't...
but
strong
inference,
as
justice
ginsburg
said
much
earlier,
was
the
standard
not
only
in
the
second
circuit
but
in
the
first
circuit
and
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
live
to
fight
another
day?
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
excuse
me.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
look
at
the
statute
in
its
entirety.
this
isn't
a
statute
that
just
deals
with
pleading
scienter.
look
at
the
provisions
dealing
with
the
selection
of
lead
representative,
which
has
produced
this
incredible
shift
from
'95
to
public
institutions,
pensions
and
labor
unions.
they
don't
bring
frivolous
cases.
look
at
the
control
that
statute
gives
over
selection
of
them
with
notice
provisions
to
make
sure
you've
got
the--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
notion
of
strong
inference
starting
with
the
second
circuit
doctrine,
as
used
in
many
other
circuits,
was
actually
a
much
lower
standard
than
what
we
are
recommending.
if
i
believe...
if
i
think
back
at
greenstone,
it
was
reason
to
believe,
or
tends
to
believe,
or
circumstantial
evidence
in
greenstone
and
in
burlington
coat.
under
our
standard
of
preponderance,
the
ability
to
find
preponderance,
you
are
elevated.
you
are
also
elevated
by
the
preceding
subdivision
which
requires
a
level
of
particularization,
never
known
in
federal
rule--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
have...
forgive
me.
i
haven't
seen
a
judicial
opinion
that
says
at
the
33
and
one-third
percentage
of
probability,
i've
got
to
give
it
to
the
jury,
because
that
jury
might
file
for
my--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--is
that
because
you
never
met
a
plaintiff
you
really
liked?
[laughter]
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
took
a
liberty
there
with
the
justice.
i
don't
think
you
can
ascribe
a
percentage
to
it.
i
think--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
think--
i
think
strong
inference...
if
we're
doing
the
numbers
game...
may
actually
be
40
percent.
if
a
district
judge
is
looking,
again,
i
say
at
the
entirety
of
discounts--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--oh,
i
would
hope
it's
stronger.
i
would
hope
it's
higher
than
probable
cause.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
and--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--no,
i
think
they
mean
what
a
district
judge
honoring
his
article
iii
commission
concludes
after
an
intensive
evaluation
of
the
entirety
of
the
complaint,
looking
for
that
strong
inference,
putting
on
his
sort
of
motion
to
dismiss
12(b)(6)
hat,
says
okay--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--no,
i
did
not
mean
that.
don't
take
me
literally
on
that.
for
heavens
sakes,
i'm
from
brooklyn.
i'm
very
colloquial.
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
understand,
you
keep
asking,
quite
properly
obviously,
how
does
strong
inference
change
anything?
the
test
we
have
proposed
and
the
test
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
applied
is
not
the
classic
12(b)(6)
have
you
stated
a
claim,
because
we
all
know
at
least
traditionally,
under
notice
pleading,
you
can
march
through
that.
this
test,
if
you
follow
that
time
line
backward,
is
in
effect
asking
that
district
judge
to
make
a
decision
on
looking
at
the
totality
of
this
complaint,
is
this
case
trial
worthy?
it's
a
curious
thing.
i
don't
envy
district
judges
who
have
to
do
this.
is
it
trial
worthy?
why
would
congress
say,
if
a
district
judge
is
willing
to
say
under
the
classic
test,
i
think
it's
trial
worthy,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
cut
that
case
off.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
oh,
i
think
he
is
becoming
slightly
schizoid,
he
is
saying,
i'm
looking
at
strong
inference.
i'm
looking
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
structure
as
it's
been,
the
usual
procedure,
200
years,
and
i
have
to
make
a
judgment
because
congress
was
pushing
here.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
i
have
to
make
a
decision
on
the
basis
of
what
i've
got,
which
is
virtually
nothing...
let's
face
that...
i
think...
i
think
if
these
allegations
are
proven,
it
is
certainly
trial
worthy.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
well,
the
realities
out
there
are
they
built
a
wall.
they
put
in
all
of
these
procedural
protections
and
they
said
no
discovery
until
you
climb
the
wall.
now
what
kind
of
a
wall
was
it?
was
it
a
dutch
dike
or
the
berlin
wall?
if
you
look
at
that
statute,
contrary
to
what
mr.
phillips
urges,
there
are
multiple
policies
expressed
in
that
statute,
one
of
which
is,
private
cases
are
good.
let's
just
get
the
right
people
to
run
those
private
cases.
let's
control
them.
let's,
let's
have
a
greater
threshold,
but
let's
not
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water.
because
everybody
seems
to
agree
private
cases
help.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
way
you
state
it,
justice,
is
something
very
hard
for
me
to
respond
to.
congress
did
not
change
the
persuasiveness,
the
proof
burden.
if
you
go
through
the
statute,
you
will
see
spots
where
they
did.
congress
knew
how
to
change
proof
standards.
congress
knew
how
to
change
federal
rules.
congress
did
not
change
the
proof
in
private
actions.
congress
did
not
change
all
of
the
background
procedure
like
the
background
procedure
in
jones
and...
it
is
just
not
there
yet.
congress
did
change
a
couple
of
federal
rules
explicitly.
so
i,
i
cannot
comprehend
how,
if
the
case
reached
the
jury,
you
would
have
to
charge
above
predominance.
and
i,
i
think
we've
got
a
stone
rolling
downhill
to
the
dismissal
point,
which
is
why
we
have
urged
in
the
brief
and
why
the
seventh
circuit
was
concerned
as
was
the
sixth
about
this
jury
trial
implication--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--why
do
i
feel
wind
whipping
past
my
ears
as
i
go
through
a
trap
door?
[laughter]
ironically,
ironically,
i
think
i
have
to
say
if
congress,
leaving
to
one
side
justiciability
problems
with
the
discovery
cause
of
action,
if
congress
created
a
discovery
cause
of
action
it
could
ascribe
to
it
whatever
incidents
it
wanted
to--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that
is
correct.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
seriously
argues
that
discovery
is
a
constitutional
right.
the
jury
trial
implications
of
this
new
cause
of
action
are
interesting.
this
court
has
protected
post-1791
statutory
claims
and
their
right
to
jury
trial,
but
you're
positing
one
that
wasn't
known
in
1791,
and
maybe
it
could
be
