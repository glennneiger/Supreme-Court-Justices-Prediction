mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
meritorious
private
actions
are
an
essential
supplement
to
government
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws,
abusive
action
impose
substantial
costs
on
companies
and
their
shareholders.
as
a
cornerstone
of
its
effort
in
the
reform
act
to
address
the
problem
of
abusive
actions,
congress
adopted
uniform
and
more
stringent
pleading
requirements
including
the
strong
inference
requirement
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
holding
that
a
plaintiff
can
satisfy
that
requirement
simply
by
alleging
facts
which
an
inference
of
state
of
mind
could
be
drawn.
the
court
of
appeals
thereby
misinterpreted
the
reform
act.
and--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--first
of
all
to
be
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
address
that
question
in
this
case,
because
we
don't
believe
that
that
sort
of
disparity
would
present
any
seventh
amendment
concerns.
however,
if
the
court
does
believe
that
any
disparity
in
the
degree
of
probability
required
does
present
seventh
amendment
concerns,
we
believe
that
it
is
more
consistent
with
congress's
intent
to
apply
the
strong
inference
requirement
at
the
proof
stage
as
well
as
the
pleading
stage
rather
than
to
water
down
the
strong
inference
requirement
that
congress
adopted
at
the
pleading
stage.
and
we
believe
that
that
requirement
does
impose
a
very
high
burden.
in
our
view,
it
requires
a
plaintiff
to
allege
facts
that
give
rise
to
a
high
likelihood
that
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
acted
with
the
necessary
state
of
mind
follows
from
those
allegations.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
that
that
is
right,
justice
kennedy.
i
suppose
that
if
the
perceived
constitutional
concern
is
solely
regarding
the
degree
of
likelihood
that
is
required,
it
could
be
applied
simply
at
the
summary
judgment
stage;
but
to
the
extent
that
the
court
believes
that
it
is
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
a
given
set
of
facts
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
the
requisite
strength
then
yes,
the
jury
would
need
to
be
instructed
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
strong--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
again,
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
address
that
question.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
the
statute
by
its
terms
only--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
yes
if
the
court
feels
it
needs
to
address
that
question.
and
to
be
sure,
the
strong
inference
standard
that
congress
adopted
was
framed
only
in
terms
of
the
pleading
stage.
and
our
view--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
that
it
is,
justice
ginsburg,
to
this
limited
extent.
in
an
ordinary
civil
case,
the
case
is
governed
of
course
by
rule
8.
and
in
some
sense
the
rule
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
must
be
construed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
is
really
derived
from
rule
8
and
its
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
need
only
provide
a
shortened
claim
statement
of
the
relevant
underlying
facts
in
order
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss.
what
congress
did
in
the
reform
act
was
to
require
first
of
all
some
degree
of
particularity
in
allegation;
but
congress
went
further
than
that;
and
to
the
extent
that
congress
spoke
in
terms
of
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
allegations,
we
do
believe
that
congress
abrogated
the
background
rule
that
the
allegations
must
be
read
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
or
as
some
courts
have
put
it,
that
all
reasonable
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
complaint
should
be
drawn
in
the
plaintiff's
favor.
that
clearly
is
a
change
on
the
preexisting
law;
and
it
is
a
change
with
regard
to
the
law
that
circuits
were
applying
before
the
enactment
of
the
reform
act.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
guess,
justice
souter,
that
i
would
wonder
what
it
would
mean
to
say
that
you
read
the
allegations
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
if
what
it
means
is
that
a
plaintiff
can
simply
accumulate
reasonable
subsidiary
inferences
in
order
to
create
the
strong
inference
of
state
of
mind
that
is
ultimately
required,
then
i
think
i
would
disagree
that
that
rule
remains
in
effect.
precisely
because
our
view
is
that
in
applying
the
strong
inference
standard,
a
court
should
consider
other
possible
explanations
for
the
defendant's
conduct
that
are
not
foreclosed
by
the
allegations--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
our
only
concern,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
where
a
plaintiff
includes
ambiguous
allegations
in
the
complaint,
a
court
should
consider
the
possibility
that
those
ambiguities
work
to
the
defendant's
favor
as
well
as
working
to
the
plaintiff's
favor.
and
one
concrete
example
of
that
in
this
case
are
the
allegations
that
concern
the
titan
5500.
there
are
allegations
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
study
and
there
were
various
internal
reports
that
indicated
that
demand
for
that
product
was
declining.
but
the
complaint
does
not
specifically
allege
that
that
study
and
those
internal
reports
were
even
available
at
the
time
the
ceo
made
the
alleged--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that
is
certainly
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
in
our
view,
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
here.
and
the
reason
that
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
here
is
in
making
the
probabilistic
determination
that
is
required
by
the
reform
act,
a
court
is
taking
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true.
it
is
not
engaging
in
any
weighing
of
the
evidence.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
views
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
as
sufficiently
substantial
to
trigger
the
canon
of
constitutional
avoidance,
then
we
do
believe
that
the
better
view,
the
view
that
is
more
consistent
with
congress's
intent,
is
that
if
the
court
is
choosing
between
raising
the
standard
at
the
pre
stage
and
watering
down
the
standard
at
the
pleadings
stage,
we
believe
that
the
former
is
more
consistent
with
congress's--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
congress
was
concerned,
justice
alito,
with
the
problem
of
abusive
pleading.
that
much
is
crystal
clear.
and
as
part
of
that
concern,
congress
was
concerned
that
plaintiffs
could
readily
allege
fraud
by
hindsight,
and
congress
may
have
been
concerned
that
the
plaintiff
could
do
so
not
only
by
making
a
conclusory
allegation
of
state
of
mind,
but
also
making
a
slightly
less
conclusory
allegation
of
state
of
mind
by
alleging
facts
that
merely
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
inference
of
state
of
mind.
if
congress
hadn't
had
that
concern,
it
obviously
could
have
codified
the
reasonable
inference
standard
that
was
then
in
use
by
a
number
of
other
courts.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
breyer,
our
primary
concern
in
this
case
is
with
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
articulated
the
applicable
standard,
which
we
believe
may
have
pernicious
effects
in
future
cases.
and
so
we
certainly
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
vacate
and
remand
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
the
correct
standard.
but
just
to
be
clear--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--in
our
view,
justice
ginsburg,
applying
the
correct
standard,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
reversed.
and
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
application
of
the
standard,
we
certainly
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
come
out
the
other
way.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
it
was
just
that
point,
justice
breyer,
namely,
that
if
the
court
believes
that
it
would
be
useful
to
provide
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
by
applying
the
standard
itself
in
this
case,
we
do
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
rather
than
vacated.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
requisite
scienter
is
either
intent
or
recklessness,
with
regard
to
the
underlying
conduct
at
issue,
in
effect--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes,
that's
right.
and
in
fact,
in
misstatement
cases,
that
is
knowledge
of
falsity.
