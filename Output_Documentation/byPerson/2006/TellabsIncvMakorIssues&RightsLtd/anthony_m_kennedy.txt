justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
some
point
during
your
argument...
and
i
know
you
only
have
20
minutes...
will
you
tell
me
whether
or
not
in
your
view
the
pleading
standard
that
the
judge
must
follow
is
equivalent,
is
the
same
as
the
instruction
that's
given
to
the
jury?
because
if
it
isn't,
then
the
seventh
amendment
argument
may
have
some
more
force.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
writing...
i
take
it,
so
far
as
the
jury,
it's
just
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not,
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
submission
is,
maybe
not
in
this
case,
but
insofar
as
your
theory
of
the
case,
that
the
trial
judge
can,
and
in
fact
must
basically
apply
a
standard
of
fact...
standard
of
proof
that's
higher
than
that
what
the
jury
would.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
burden
of
over
50
percent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
have
to
make
it
clear.
is
the
high
likelihood,
or
strong
inference,
is
greater
than
more
likely
than
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
of
how...
how
this
should
work
in
your
view?
assume
the
ceo
makes
misstatements
as
to
the
earnings
report
and
the
acceptance
of
one
of
its
new
products.
just
assume
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
make
a
strong
inference
that
a
ceo
knows
what
his
own
earnings
reports
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
make
a
strong
inference
that
a
ceo
knows
the
status
of
current
earnings--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
he
makes,
when
he
makes
a
statement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
by
the
proof
stage
you
mean
both
summary
judgment
and
submission
to
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
think
about
the
following--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
requisite
standard,
knowledge
of
falsity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
intent
to
make
a
false
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
take
judicial
notice
that
a
ceo
knows
these
things
and
that's
the
strong
inference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
agree
you
have
to
have
that?
you
have
to
have
some
specific
allegation
to
show
of
his
knowledge?
we
can't
just
infer
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
say
that
you
could
have
a
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard
that
must
be
met
at
the
pleading
level,
but
more
likely
than
not
at
the
jury
level?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
want
to
know
what
the
rule
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
hope
we're
going
to
recognize
that
congress
thought
it
was
doing
something.
your
argument
so
far,
professor,
doesn't
indicate
that
congress--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
indicated
that
the...
you
know,
the
plaintiff
had
to
do
all
this
investigation.
the
whole
point
of
this
was
that
the
defendants
were
being
disadvantaged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
more
likely
than
not,
most
people
think
of
49,
50
percent.
can
you
tell
us
whether
strong
inference
is
stronger
than
more
likely
than
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
sounds
to
me
like--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
want,
i
want
to
be
fair.
i
interpreted
your
argument...
and
please
tell
me
if
this
is
incorrect...
as
indicating
that
if
i
think
strong
inference
is
greater,
more
onerous
than
more
likely
than
not,
at
the
pleading
stage,
i
then
also
have
to
say
this
is
the
instruction
that
must
be
given
to
the
jury?
in
order
to
avoid
the,
the
discontinuity
between
the
pleading
stage
and
what--
