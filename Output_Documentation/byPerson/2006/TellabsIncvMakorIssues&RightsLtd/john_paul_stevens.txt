mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
talks
in
terms
of
the
percentages,
how
likely
the
inference,
the
word
strong
inference
means
50
percent,
30
percent,
60
percent.
do
you
think
the
inference
has
to
be
stronger
or
less
strong
than
the
inference
of
probable
cause
in
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
to
get
access
to
the
privacy
of
a
home
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
civil
case
would
impose
a
higher
standard
for
getting
discovery
in
a
civil
case
than
they
would
for
getting
access
to
a
citizen's
private
papers
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just...
may
i
just,
very
briefly.
putting
aside
the
constitutional
problem,
do
you
think
the
standards
are
the
same
or
different
between
the
pleading
stage
and
the
constitutional
stage...
and
the
summary
judgment
stage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
that's
not
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
either
a
yes
or
no
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
the
meaning
of
strong
inference
and
reasonable
inference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
want
to
answer
yes
or
no
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
those
words,
strong
inference,
mean
essentially
the
same
thing
as
reasonable
inference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
going
back
just
to
the
word
strong,
forgetting
the
particularization
from
it,
do
you
think
you
can
categorize
the
strength
in
percentage
terms?
they
have
to
be
more
than
50
percent?
more
than
probable
cause?
we're
talking
all
abstractly
here
and
i
find
it
easier
to
think
when
i
think
about
numbers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
we
know
that
in
the
probable
world--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
reclaim
the
question.
is
it
stronger
or
weaker
than
probable
cause
in
a
criminal
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
trial
worthy,
but
rather
discovery
worthy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
question
is
not
whether
it's
trial
worthy,
it's
whether
it's
worthy
for
discovery.
that's
really
what's
at
issue
in
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely
it
could
prohibit
discovery
altogether
which
it
did
before
they
adopt
in
1938.
