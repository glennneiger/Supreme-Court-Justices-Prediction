justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
criminal
case,
the
person
seeking
that
action
is
a
government
officer
who
presumptively
is
not
acting
out
of
selfish
motives,
whereas
we're
talking
about
private
suits
and
some
private
litigants
are
selfish.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
well,
i
don't
think
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
an
alteration
in
the
ultimate
standard,
either,
in
the
jury
standard.
what
it
was
concerned
with
is
the
enormous
expense
of...
of
discovery.
and,
and
tried
to
set
a
high
wall
to
get
to
the
discovery
stage.
i
don't
know
why
that
should
have
to
affect
or
should
logically
affect
the
standard
that
the
jury
is
told
to
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
just
saying
that
he
knew
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
saying
that
he
knew
it.
without
saying
why
they
knew
that
he
knew
it?
you're
saying
they
have
to
give
a
reason
why
they
knew
that
he
knew
it,
namely
he
routinely
read
these
reports?
suppose
they
didn't
say
that.
they
just
said
knowing
that
the...
that
the
figures
were
otherwise,
he...
he
set
them
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
could...
could
i
get
you
back
to...
to
your,
your
assertion
of
we
don't
have
to
reach
in
this
case
the
question
of
whether
the
same
standard
applies
at
trial
as,
as
at
the
pleading
stage?
it
seems
to
me
a
seventh
amendment
claim
has
been
raised.
it's
our
usual
policy
to
avoid
unnecessary
constitutional
adjudication.
if
indeed
the
two
standards
are
the
same,
there's
certainly
no
seventh
amendment
problem.
so
why
don't
we
have
to
first
of
all
decide,
in
resolving
the
seventh
amendment
claim,
whether
the
two
standards
are
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
getting
to
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
problem.
and
we
usually
run
away
from
constitutional
problems.
we
don't
even
want
to
consider
the
merits
of
it.
and
we
don't
have
to,
if
indeed
the
two
standards
are
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
congress
just
established
an
entry
qualification
for
getting
into
court.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
entry
qualifications.
in
diversity
cases,
you...
if
you
allege
diversity,
and
it
existed
at
the
outset,
that's
fine.
that
doesn't
have
to
be
proved
at
the
end
of
the
case.
indeed
even
if
you
prove
the
contrary,
the
case
is
still
validly
there.
congress
can
establish
entry
requirements
even
when
they
differ
from,
or
have
indeed
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
that
the
jury
is
supposed
to
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
then
on
appeal,
we
would
say,
no,
it's
not
a
strong
inference,
or
yes,
it
is
a
strong
inference.
i
mean,
i
hope
we're
going
to
establish
some
standards
for
how
you
go
about
determining
whether
there's
a
strong
inference
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
66
and
two-thirds.
i
think
that
is--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
clear
and
convincing?
is
it
below
clear...
i
mean,
they
are
the
only
two
standards
i
actually
understand.
without
picking
a
number
out
of
air,
is
preponderance,
i
think
i
can
figure
that
out.
and
i
guess
i
can
figure
out
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
other
than
those,
when
you
talking
about
strong,
when
you
talk
about
clear
and
convincing,
i
have
no
idea
what
those
things
mean.
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
they
mean
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
write
that
down.
we
should
not
take
you
literally.
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
miller,
suppose
congress
set
up
a
entirely
separate
cause
of
action.
it's
caused...
it's
called
a
discovery
cause
of
action,
okay?
and
it
sets
forth
as
the
condition
for
pursuing
that
cause
of
action
a
standard
that
your,
your
allegation
has
to
be
indeed
clear
and
convincing.
okay?
and
then
if
you
win
that,
you
can
take
whatever
you
get
out
of
the
discovery
and
bring
a
lawsuit.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
