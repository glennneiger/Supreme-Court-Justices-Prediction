mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1995
congress
acted
decisively
to
curb
abusive
private
securities
litigation.
it
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
rejecting
categorically
the
traditional
rule
of
notice
pleading
in
complaints
that
are
filed
under
the
securities
laws.
instead
it
declared
that,
and
this
is
at
page
2
of
our
petition,
"the
complaint
shall
state
with
particularity
facts
giving
rise
to
a
strong
inference
that
the
defendant
acted
with
the
required
state
of
mind.
"
the
fundamental
error
in
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
in
this
case
was
in
writing
out
of
the
statute
the
strong
inference
language
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
be
not
only
in
those
statutes,
but
obviously
applied
rigorously.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
the
same.
i
think
congress
actually
has
greater
authority
in
dealing
with
pleadings
that
is
distinct
from
the
seventh
amendment
right,
but
the
court
doesn't
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
particular
case
because
i
think
the
inferences
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
draw
from
the
record
in
this
case
would
avoid
any--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
what
the
court
held...
held
in
huddleston,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
important
as
a
standard
of
allegation,
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
analysis
of
the
allegations
of
the
lawyers,
and
not
any
kind
of
an
evidentiary
showing
by
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
so
i
do
think
it's
removed.
i
mean,
this
court
has
really
never
addressed
the
issue
of
the
extent
to
which
the
seventh
amendment
extends
to
pleadings.
and
i
don't
think
this
is
the
case
in
which
to
take
up
that
issue
because
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
at
least
we're
asking
for
as
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
reform
act
is
that
you
need
to
apply...
that
you
simply
follow
matushita
and
monsanto,
and
that
is
to
force
the
plaintiffs
to
demonstrate
that
innocent
explanations
can
be
set
aside.
and
if
you
take
that
particular
approach,
which
clearly
is
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment,
then
it
seems
to
me
you...
the
seventh
that
you
followed
under
the
constitution,
is
eliminated.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
other
instances
in
which
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
constitutional
problem.
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
question
is,
does
congress
have
the
power
to
enforce
its
view
of
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed
as
a
matter
of
policy
at
the
pleadings
stage,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
but
again,
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
100
percent
true.
i
think
the
real
problem
with
the
second
circuit
is
there's
no
monolithic
second
circuit
rule
that's
out
there.
the
second
circuit
applied
a
number
of
cases
under
its
particularity
standards
under
9(b)
prior
to
the
time
congress
adopted
the
strong
inference
standard.
some
of
them...
i
think
we
would
be
very
comfortable
with
the
analysis
in
shields
versus
citytrust
bank,
for
instance.
the
way
judge
jacobs
analyzed
the
complaint
in
that
case
is
precisely
the
way
we're
trying
to
analyze
the
complaint
in
this
case.
so
if
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
stronger
than
that,
although
i
don't
know
how
to
translate
that
into
percentages,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
use
of
the
language
"strong
inference"
carries
with
it
a
very
significant
burden
that
has
to
be
demonstrated
by
the
buyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
and
if
you
read
the
securities
industries
amicus
brief,
it
ticks
off
all
of
the
instances
of
harm
that
are
caused
by
allowing...
too
much
of
the
private
litigation
is
precisely
that,
which
congress
was
responding
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
believe
congress
would
have
intended
it
to
be
more--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
would
make
that
argument.
i
don't
have
to
make
that
argument
here
because
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
same
standards
of
matsushita
and
monsanto
that
say
you
have
to
exclude
innocent
explanations
would
apply
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
as
we're
trying
to
apply
at
the
pleading
stage,
so
there
is
no
disconnect.
but
if
i
were
actually
forced
into
that
position,
i
think
i
would
take
that
view,
although
i
probably
would
argue
first
that
the
standard
of
huddleston
ought
to
be
reconsidered,
rather
than
rejecting
clearly
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1995
when
it
acted
to
curb
the
abuses
of
private
securities
litigation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
there
may
be
a
slight
semantic
difference
there,
but
the
truth
is
at
end
of
the
day
all
we're
asking
for
the
court
to
do
is
to
evaluate
the
complaint,
taking
both
the
positive
and
the
negative
inferences
from
it,
excluding
ambiguities,
interpreting
them
not
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
as
you
traditionally
do,
take
into
account
whether
there
is
an
allegation
of
motive,
and
say
at
the
end
of
the
day
whether
or
not
that
reaches
a...
rises
to
the
level
of
a
strong
inference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
i'm
going
to
err
on
either
side,
i
obviously
prefer
that
the
court
carries
out
congress's
intent.
we
think
you
needn't
go
any
further
than
matsushita
did
in
order
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case.
obviously
there
is
probably
some
potential
distance
between
the
two,
where
you
could
certainly
interpret
the
strong
inference
standard
more
in
the
line
the
way
the
united
states
interprets
it,
as
creating
a
high
likelihood
of
scienter.
and
we
don't...
we're
certainly
not
objecting
to
that.
we're
just
saying
to
the
court
that
you
needn't
go
that
far
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
although
obviously
we
would
welcome
a
ruling
along
those
lines
if
the
court's
inclined
to
go
that
far.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
again,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
puts
an
issue...
and
we
raised
this
in
our
reply
brief,
whether
or
not
huddleston
should
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
this
sort
of
basic
change
in
the
way
congress
is
approaching
private
securities
litigation.
but,
so
my--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
go
at
it.
but
if
it
turned
out
to
be
a
disconnect,
that
would
not
offend
at
least
my
sense
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
the
court
were
concerned
that
somehow
there
is
a
disconnect
between
the
pleading
standard
and
the
ultimate
standard
of
proof,
the
way
to
resolve
that
incongruity...
if
it
is
one...
would
to
be
reconsider
the
ultimate
standard
of
proof,
not
to
throw
out
the
clearly
congressionally
approved
baby
as
part
of
that
bath
water.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
with
a
specific
earnings
report
rather
than
just
simply
sort
of
sales
projections
and
demand?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
my
guess
is
they--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
they
would
have
to
make
an
allegation
that
the...
that
the
ceo
routinely
is
provided
with
that
information
rather
than
simply
assume
it.
i
think
it's
the
same
problem
you
have
with
their...
with
their
allegation
that
it's
common
sense
that
ceos
will
act
to
protect
their
own
personal
self
interest
and
the
overall
welfare
of
the
company
by
misrepresenting
the
status
of
events.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
that's
sufficient,
because
it
requires
for
the
facts
that
particularly
show--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the...
but
the
problem
with
that
allegation,
and
we're
talking
about
the
6500,
the
titan
6500
product
specifically,
in
that
context,
the
report
is,
there's
nothing
in
there
that
says
what
those
reports
say
about
the
6500.
and
remember,
this
is
a
case
where
the
plaintiffs
have
27
whistleblowers
inside
the
company
who
could
provide
you
with
all
of
the
detail
in
the
world;
and
yet
when
it
comes
time
to
tell
you
what
was
in
the
6500
report
that
would...
that
would
suggest
that
it's
not
available,
there's
not
word
one
in
the
allegation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right
but
that's...
that
being
delayed
for
a
year
is
not
the
basis
for
the
claim.
the
question
was
is
the,
is
the
6500
being
sold;
and
that
was
the
allegation.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
he...
i...
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that,
based
on
what
they've
claimed
because
they've
not
produced
a
report
or
said
that
there's
anything
inside
the
report
that
says
to
the
contrary
about
that.
again,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
justice
breyer,
that...
that
long
been
delayed
period
runs
all
the
way
back
to
1998.
and
we're
talking
about
events
in
2000
and
2001.
so
the
notion
that
it's
been
long
delayed
says
nothing
about
what
mr.
notebaert
was...
was
revealing
in
march
and
april
and
june
of
2001.
it,
it
could
potentially,
but
it
equally,
it
couldn't.
it's
the
same
problem
you
get
with
the
5500,
where
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
it
is
quite
plausible
that
mr.
notebaert
never
saw
those
reports.
now
how
you
can
make
that
concession
and
nevertheless
say
there
is
a
strong
inference
that
he
acted
to
deceive,
strikes
me
as
absolutely
implausible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
you...
you...
justice
breyer,
you
make
a
leap
there.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
is
that
they
all
knew
that.
the
point
is
they
knew
that
it
was
delayed
back
in
1999.
what
they
don't
do
is
tie
that
in
to
what
he
knew
in
2001;
and
that,
to
me,
that's
the
central
point
in
this
case,
is
do
you
require
that
kind
of
specificity?
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
other
way
to
read
what
congress
says
in
this
statute
than
to
do
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
to
confess
i'm...
i'm
slightly
perplexed
by
exactly
what
the
respondent's
position
is
in
this
case
so
i'm
inclined
to
kind
of
go
back
to
the
core
points
that
have
been
raised
by
the
questions
from...
from
the
court.
and
in
the
first
instance,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
apply
the
strong
inference
standard.
if...
you
can
compare
the
language
from
the
first
circuit
circuit
that
specifically
says
it
has
to
be
reasonable
and
strong,
strong
has
completely
fallen
out
here.
i
don't
see
any
way
to
read
it
the
other
way.
i
think
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is
how
do,
how
should
you
write
the
opinion,
i
think
the
meaningful
way
to
write
the
opinion
is
to
be
respectful
of
justice
scalia's
desire
to
provide
guidance.
so
i
do
think
you
should
say,
you
have
to,
as
justice
alito
said,
review
the
entirety
of
the
document
and...
and
infer
both
positively
and
negatively
as
you
go
forward.
we
know
that
has
to
be
true.
almost
every
court
that's
dealt
with
these
issues--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
there's
no
question
that
that's...
that
that's
what
congress
had
to
have
meant
under
these
circumstances.
and
the
best
example
of
that
is
the
ceo
who
sells
securities
during
the
time
period
of
the
class
action.
there
are
dozens
of
cases
in
which
that
happens.
does
it
create
an
inference
of
scienter?
it
might,
because
it's
quite
possible
that
he
sold
and...
he
lied
about
the
stock
in
order
to
keep
the
price
up
to
sell.
it
is
also
possible
that
he
sells
only
about
1
percent
of
the
stock--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
ginsburg,
i
couldn't
disagree
with
you
more
about
that.
that
is
precisely
what
congress
says
when...
when
it
says
with
particularity.
and
when
congress
says
you
have
to
look
at
each
defendant.
you
cannot
do--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
strong
inference
of
scienter
is
not
pled
on
a
group
basis.
it
has
to
be
pled
with
respect
to
each
individual
defendant.
so
it's
quite
convenient--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
were
a
lot
more
than
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
i...
i
mean,
i
was
commenting
primarily
on
professor
miller's
decision
to
just
sort
of
sweep
everything
in
and
say
look,
back
in
1999
and
2000
when
the
seventh
circuit
itself
specifically
said
that
the
knowledge,
for
instance,
of
the
5500
decline
didn't
happen
until
march
of
2001.
so
i
was
just
saying
you
can't
start
sweeping
everything
in.
but...
and
it
is
true,
the
court
distinguished
between
those
two
individuals;
but
the
bottom
line
remains
the
same.
you
have
to
analyze
them,
each.
and
you
have
to
take
into
account
contending
inferences.
you
have
to
construe
ambiguity
contrary
to
the
plaintiff
sometimes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
you
better
make
an
allegation
with
particularity
that
that
date
was
at
a
time
when
the
individual
would
know
that
the...
that
the
information
that
he
was
conveying
was...
was
wrong.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
infer
strongly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--scienter
otherwise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
plaintiff
can
ask
the
confidential
informant
as
much
as,
as
he
wants
about
the
information;
and
if
he
can't
come
up
with
it,
that's
the
price
you
pay.
that
was
exactly
what
congress
said,
is
if
you
cannot
make
those
particular
allegations,
then
you're
out
of
luck.
and
it's
not
as
though
they
give
you
one
shot
for
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
could
be
flip
to
say
it's
the
right
way.
but
i
think
the...
i
mean
the
answer
to
the,
the
answer
to
why
to
choose
our
approach
is
because
it
is
consistent
with
matsushita
and
monsanto
and
it
will
allow,
justice
breyer,
to
apply
it
in
an
individualized
way,
in
a
fashion
that
will
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
thank
you.
