justice
ruth
bader

mr.
phillips,
the
seventh
amendment
or
not,
the
question
in
12(b)(6)
is
has
the
plaintiff
stated
a
claim,
and
at
the
end
of
the
line
it's
has
the
plaintiff
proved
a
claim.
but
you're
stating
two
different
claims.
the
claim
that
must
be
stated
is
a
stronger
claim
than
the
claim
that
must
be
proved,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
other
instance
where
that
is
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
asking
it
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
but
i'm
thinking,
how
do
you
construe
these
words,
what
is
it,
"strong
inference"?
and
the
words
come
out
of,
as
i
understand
it,
a
second
circuit
decision.
so
i
would
think
the
most
logical
thing
is
that
you'd
look
at
the
second
circuit
decision
and
say
ah,
congress
picked
up
those
words
from
the
second
circuit
decision,
then
we
should
pick
up
the
standards
that
the
second
circuit
applied.
but
your
definition
of
strong
inference
is
quite
different
from
what
the
second
circuit's
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
fair
to
say
at
the
pleading
stage
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
whereas
at
the
end
of
the
road
it
would
only
be
more
probable
than
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
a
pleading
stage,
i
would
like
your
clear
view
on
how
much
that
changes.
it
has
been
the
understanding
that
when
there
is
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
you
look
only
to
the
face
of
the
complaint
and
you
construe
the
allegations
in
that
complaint
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
is
that
rule
not
applied
under
the
interpretation
you
are
giving
us
of
strong
inference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
it.
could
the
court
of
appeals
applying
the
standard
that
you
say
is
correct
come
to
the
same
decision
that
it
came
to
using
a
different
verbal
formula.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
one
specific
example
that
the
petitioners
did,
and
that
is
this
matter
of
the
channel
stuffing.
they
say
here's
a
notion,
channel
stuffing.
it
could
mean
goods
were
shipped
that
nobody
ever
ordered,
or
it
could
mean
something
different.
it
could
mean
discounting
and
other
incentives
to
get
people
to
buy.
so
there's
good
channel
stuffing
and
bad
channel
stuffing,
and
it
sounds
like
good
cholesterol,
bad
cholesterol;
you
can't
tell
from
the
allegations
that
it's
the
bad
stuffing
that's
at
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
doing
away
with
reading
the
allegations
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
phillips,
you
don't
look
at
these
things
one
at
a
time.
you
look
at
them
altogether.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
statute
all
you
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
you
must
plead
the
facts
with
particularity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
one
judges
the
adequacy
of
the
complaint,
one
looks
at
all
the
facts
pleaded
with
particularity,
not
just
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
that
this
case
was
a
good
example.
there
were
two
defendants
and
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
to
take
the
two
that
were
at
issue
in
this
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
ceo,
yeah,
there's
enough
there
to
get
over
that
threshold.
the
other
guy,
no,
there
wasn't.
so
it's
not
that
she's
saying
what
you
find
for
one,
you
find
for
all.
she
is
going
at
it
defendant
by
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
a
report
that
you
know
exists
because
you
had
one
of
these
26
confidential
people
tell
you?
but
you
haven't
seen
the
report,
so
you
don't
have
the
date
on
it?
and
you
won't
know
that
date
unless
you
have
access
to
discovery.
do
you
have
to
assume
the
date
is
later
rather
than
sooner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
if
the
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
plaintiff
can't
know
for
sure
without
seeing
the
document
with
a
date
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress...
congress
used
words,
"strong
inference".
those
words
are
not
self-defining.
one
can
think
of
several
ways,
in
fact
the
courts
of
appeals
did
think
of
several
ways.
why
should
we
pick
your
way
as
opposed
to
the
other
ways
one
might
define
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
curtail
abusive
securities
for
litigation,
congress
in
1995
enacted
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act
(pslra).
exacting,
pleading
requirements
are
among
the
pslra’s
control
measures.
the
act
requires
plaintiffs
to
state
with
particularity
both
the
facts
constituting
the
alleged
violation
and
the
facts
evidencing
scienter
or
state
of
mind
i.e.,
the
defendant’s
intention
“to
deceive,
manipulate,
or
defraud.”
the
courts
below
agreed
that
plaintiff
stated
the
facts
constituting
the
violation
with
sufficient
particularity.
this
whole
question
reconfirms
concerns
the
scienter
requirement,
in
the
words
of
section
21d
(b)(2)
of
the
act
“did
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
give
rise
to
a
strong
inference
that
the
defendant
acted
with
an
intent
to
defraud.”
congress
let
the
key
term
“strong
inference”
undefined,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
over
its
meaning.
the
petitioner’s
here
are
tellabs,
a
manufacturer
of
specialized
equipment
for
fiber
optic
networks
and
richard
notebaert,
tellabs’
chief
executive
officer
and
president
during
the
relevant
time
period.
respondents
are
shareholders
who
purchase
tellabs’
stock
between
december
11,
2000
and
june
19,
2001.
the
shareholders
accuse
notebaert
and
by
imputation
tellabs’
of
deceiving
the
investing
public
about
the
true
value
of
tellabs’
stock.
according
to
the
shareholders,
notebaert
made
a
series
of
false
representation
to
investor
in
which
he
portrait
tellabs
as
continuing
to
enjoy
a
large
demand
for
its
products
and
as
earning
record
revenues
when
in
fact
that
companies
prospects
were
glooming.
when
tellabs
eventually
disclosed
the
truth
about
its
shrinking
sales
and
earnings
in
june
2001
the
price
of
tellabs
stock
plummeted.
the
shareholders
then
sued
to
recoup
their
losses.
tellabs
and
notebaert
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaints
on
the
ground
that
they
didn’t
plead
intent
to
deceive
with
sufficient
particularity.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
a
holding
that
the
facts
alleged
by
the
shareholders
were
to
thin
to
generate
a
strong
inference
of
scienter.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
plaintiff’s
measured
up
that
to
the
pslra’s
strong
inference
specification
and
the
appeals
court
said
by
alleging
facts
from
which
a
reasonable
person
could
infer
that
the
defendant
acted
with
fraudulent
intent.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
federal
courts
over
the
meaning
of
strong
inference.
taking
account
of
the
pslra’s
twin
goals
curbing
frivolous
litigation
while
preserving
investor’s
ability
to
recover
unmeritorious
claims,
we
establish
the
following
prescriptions.
first,
faced
with
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss
a
securities
fraud
action
for
failure
to
plead
intent
to
defraud
with
sufficient
particularity.
the
district
court
must
as
it
generally
does
under
that
rule
assume
all
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
be
true.
second,
courts
must
consider
the
complaint
in
its
entirety
they
should
determine
whether
all
of
the
facts
alleged
taking
collectively
give
rise
to
a
strong
inference
of
scienter
not
whether
each
and
every
allegation
considered
individually
meets
that
standard.
third,
in
making
this
determination
courts
must
engage
in
a
comparative
examination,
they
must
take
into
account
plausible
inferences
from
the
alleged
facts
opposing
those
urged
by
the
plaintiff.
the
seventh
circuit
fells
short
in
this
third
regard,
the
appeals
court
drew
inferences
favoring
plaintiffs
but
decline
to
consider
opposing
inferences
that
one-sided
approach
we
hold
was
erroneous.
the
strong
inference
requirement
will
be
met
we
rule
only
if
a
reasonable
person
would
find
the
inference
of
scienter
cogent
and
at
least
as
compelling
as
any
opposing
inference
of
non-fraudulent
intent
one
could
draw
from
the
facts
alleged.
the
seventh
circuit
limited
in
its
inquiry
because
of
an
undue
concern
that
comparative
assessment
of
plausible
inferences
at
the
pleading
stage
would
impinge
upon
the
plaintiff’s
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
it
is
congress’
prerogative
that
created
federal
statutory
claims
to
prescribe
both
what
must
be
pleaded
to
stay
the
claim
and
what
must
be
proved
to
prevail
on
the
merits.
under
our
reading
of
the
pslra’s
“strong
inference”
language,
a
plaintiff
alleging
securities
code
is
not
forced
to
plead
more
than
she
would
be
required
to
prove
at
trial.
to
survive
a
threshold
motion
to
dismiss,
she
must
plead
backs
rendering
an
inference
of
scienter
at
least
as
likely
as
any
plausible
opposing
inference.
then
to
prevail
a
trial
she
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
is
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
defendant
acted
with
a
culpable
state
of
mind.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
plaintiff’s
complaint
in
light
of
the
prescriptions
we
announced
today.
we
therefore
vacate
the
seventh
circuit’s
judgment
and
remand
so
that
the
case
may
be
reexamined
in
accord
with
our
construction
of
congress’
strong
interest
specification.
separate
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment
have
been
filed
by
the
justices
scalia
and
alito.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
