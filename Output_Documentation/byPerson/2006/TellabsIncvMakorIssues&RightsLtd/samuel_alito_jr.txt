justice

alito,

doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
standard
at
the
pleading
stage
have
to
be
the
same
as
the
standard
at
the
summary
judgment
stage?
if...
suppose
that
a
certain
set
of
facts
is
sufficient
to
defeat
summary
judgment.
if
the
plaintiff
alleges
all
of
those
facts
in
the
complaint,
are
you
saying
that
that
complaint
could
be
dismissed
even
though
supporting
those
facts
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
would
be
enough
to
defeat
a
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
there
is
no
seventh
amendment
problem,
what
sense
would
it
make
to
have
a
regime
that
says
plaintiff
has
to
plead
more
than
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
at
summary
judgment
or
prove
at
trial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
you
assess
the
strength
of
the
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
without
considering
all
the
inferences
that
could
be
drawn
from
those
facts?
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
you
see
somebody...
let's
say
you
saw
somebody
today
walking
east
on
pennsylvania
avenue
in
the
direction
of
capitol
hill.
now
you...
there's...
you
could
draw
an
inference
that
the
person
is
coming
to
the
supreme
court.
and
if
there
were
no
other
building
in
washington,
that
would
be
a
very
strong
inference.
but
don't
you
also
have
to
consider
the
inference
that
the
person
is
going
to
the
capitol,
the
person
is
going
to
the
library
of
congress,
the
person
is
going
to
some
other
location
up
here?
you
have
to
consider
all
the
inferences
that
you
can
draw
from
the
facts.
