justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
thought
it
was
and
when
we
did,
the
district
court
said
i
have
no
authority
in...
under...
over
any
of
these
people.
so
back
it
goes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--talking
that...
where
are
these
statements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
thermtron
was
such
a
far
cry
from
this
case.
in
thermtron
the
district
judge
said
yes,
i
have
jurisdiction
but
i'm
just
too
busy,
so
i'm
going
to
toss
this
case
back
to
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
the
court
said
in
thermtron,
so
therefore,
i
have
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
why
was
it
wrong
when
with
respect
to
the
sovereign
parties,
the
district
court
said
i
have...
these
people
are
totally
immune
from
suit;
therefore,
i
have
no
jurisdiction
over
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
request...
when
the
question
of
powerex...
authority
over
powerex
was
before
the
district
court,
did
you
request
that
the
district
court
give
you
a
1292(b)
order
before
the
court
remanded
the
case,
so
that
you
could
have
gotten
the
case...
the
question
up
on
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that
would
have
taken
care
of
it
if
the
district
judge
agreed
to
delay
the
remand
to
allow
this
question
of
law
to
be
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
anybody
in
this
case...
did
any
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
request
a
trial
by
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
have
they
asked
for
it?
has
any
party
asked
for
a
jury
trial?
if
not,
that
part
of
the
case
seems
academic.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
case
is
settled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
different
than
it
is
in
the
federal
courts.
you
have
to...
can't
wait
to
the
eve
of
trial
to
demand
a
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
osborn
made
it
very
clear
that
was
an
extraordinary
case
where
congress
had
explicitly
ordered
two
conflicting
things.
one,
it
said
no
remand
of
a
case
of
this
type,
and
then
it
said
no
review
of
remands.
so
the
court
was
as
clear
as
it
could
be
that
only
when
you
have
those
conflicting
signals
does
that
court...
does
that
case
have
any
application.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
the...
under
the
district
court's
view,
would
there
have
been
original
jurisdiction
against
powerex?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
immunity
question,
the
immunity
question
is
the
same
in
state
or
federal
court,
because
the
statute
as
it's
written,
any
foreign
sovereign,
china,
whatever,
is
as
immune
from
state
court
jurisdiction
as
it
is
from
federal
court
jurisdiction
because
congress
said
so.
but
with
respect
to
the
commercial
enterprise,
congress
said,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
federal
court
and
we're
going
to
give
you
a
judge
trial.
that
doesn't
apply
to
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
sovereign
party
who
said:
i'm
out
of
this;
i
have
suit
immunity.
and
that
was
the
b.c.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
happened
to
b.c.
hydro?
because
as
i
understand
the
district
court
sent
that
party
back,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
it
couldn't...
if
you
are
right,
then
the
ninth
circuit
never
should
have
touched
this
case.
so
what
happens
to
the
three
parties,
two
u.s.
parties,
one
british
columbia,
who
are
entitled
to
suit
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
immunity,
suit
immunity,
is
you
can't
be
sued
anyplace,
not
in
state
court,
not
in
federal
court;
you
can't
be
sued,
period.
but
now
it
is
admitted
that
you
can
be
sued.
that's
not
in
dispute
in
this
case,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
question
is
where.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
is
still
the
question
of
federal
forum
over
state
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
congress
said,
those
entities
don't
get
any
immunity,
they
get
two
things:
they
get
a
federal
forum
and
they
get
a
judge
trial.
that's
all
that's
at
stake.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
those...
have
they
been
sued
by
the
plaintiffs
in
any
of
these
cases
or
have
they
always
been
brought
in
by
defendants?
