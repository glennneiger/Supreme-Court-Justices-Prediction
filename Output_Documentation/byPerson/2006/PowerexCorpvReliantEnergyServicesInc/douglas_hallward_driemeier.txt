mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
that
the
bar
on
appellate
review
in
1447(d)
applies
only
to
remands
under
1447(c).
this
court
has
held
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
authority
to
decide
whether
a
remand
order
was,
in
fact,
one
within
the
authority
of
1447(c).
in
fact,
just
this
term
in
osborn,
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
on
the
basis
of
1447(c)
for
purported
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct.
osborn
concerned
a
particular
kind
of
categorical
exception
from
1447(c).
our
argument
is
that
as
a
categorical
matter,
the
basis
of
remand
in
this
case
was
not
one
within
the
scope
of
1447(c).
that
although
the
district
court
termed
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
defendant's
jurisdictional,
it
was
not
jurisdictional
in
the
relevant
sense.
and
this
court
held
precisely
that
in
the
oliver
american
trading
case.
there,
a
case
removed
by
mexico
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
its
immunity
and
the
district
court
certified
that
holding
as
a
jurisdictional
decision
immediately
appealable
to
this
court.
yet
this
court
looked
beyond
that
label
attached
by
the
district
court
and
held
that
sovereign
immunity
is
not
jurisdictional
in
the
relevant
sense
because
it
does
not
limit
the
authority
of
the
federal
courts
qua
federal
courts
but
rather
is
a
general
rule
that
would
preclude
suit
in
state
court
as
well.
likewise,
under
1447(c)
it
is
not
a
basis
to
remand
that
the
defendant
is
immune.
when
congress
authorized
sovereign
defendants
to
remove
cases
to
federal
court
to
vindicate
their
immunity,
it
did
not
intend
that
when
the
district
court
upheld
that
immunity,
it
would
be
remanded
to
state
court
which
would
be
free
to
disregard
the
federal
court's
decision.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the
missouri
pacific
railway
case
holds
that
even
this
court,
on
review
of
a
state
court
judgment
following
remand
cannot
review
the
remand
order
itself.
it
can
review
issues
of
federal
law
that
were
decided
by
the
state
courts
on
remand
but--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--missouri
pacific
railway
case.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
what,
what's
notable
is
that
congress
enacted
1447(e)
at
the
same
time
that
it
amended
1447(c).
it
provided
in
1447(e)
for
an
authority
to
remand
in
a
particular
instance
where
the
court
lost
subject
matter
jurisdiction
post-removal.
it
had
of
course
been
the
rule
since
this
court's
decision
in
st.
paul
mercury
indemnity,
that
post-removal
events
did
not
defeat
the
removal
court's
jurisdiction;
and
in
the
statute
it
was
made
explicit
that
1447(c)
authorized
remand
only
when
the
case
was
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction.
and
when
congress
amended
the
language
in
1998
to
make
clear
that
non-jurisdictional
defects
in
removal
had
to
be
raised
immediately
or
were
forfeited,
it
at
the
same
time...
and
added
the
language,
or
changed
the
language
in
the
second
sentence
that
raises
problems
for
our
argument;
at
the
same
time,
it
added
1447(e)
to
provide,
as
i
said,
a
particular
authority
to
remand
based
on
post-removal
events
that
would
have
been
unnecessary
if,
as
respondents
urge,
1447(c)
was
intended
to
confer
general
authority
to
remand
on
the
basis
of
post-removal
events.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no.
and
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
that
question
likewise
hold
that
a
remand
under
1447(e)
is
right
in
pari
materia
with
(d)
although
the
courts
seem
to
be
split
on
whether
the
decision
to
allow
the
joinder
is
a
separable
decision
appealable
under
waco
or
not.
but...
but
that
issue
is
not
presented.
but
what
is
significant
is
that
had
congress
intended
by
the
amendment
of
1447(c)
to
authorize
for
the
first
time
remand
on
the
basis
of
post-removal
events,
1447(e)
would
have
been
unnecessary;
and
yet,
the
legislative
history,
the
1447(e),
makes
clear
that
congress
believed
that
in
the
absence
of
that
provision,
the
court
would
have
been
limited
to
two
alternatives.
authorize
the
joinder...
or
deny
the
joinder,
or
dismiss
the
case.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the
post-removal
event
here
is
the
recognition
of
the
defendant's
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
according...
well,
apparently
the
district
court
viewed
it
as
a
post-removal
event
that
deprived
it,
or
defeated,
divested--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i...
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but...
but
the
district
court's
order
is
clear.
and
it
is
absolutely
correct
in
this
regard
that
removal
jurisdiction
existed
at
the
outset.
so
the
court
does
not
lack
removal
jurisdiction.
the
reference
in
1447(c),
second
sentence
to
"lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction",
refers
to
lacks
removal
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact,
this
court
used
that
shorthand
repeatedly
in
the
kircher
decision
to
describe
1447(c),
lacks
removal
jurisdiction.
this
court--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
court
has
to
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
statute,
how
it's
evolved.
clearly
pre-1998,
authority
to
remand
was
only
if
it
was
removed
without
jurisdiction.
and
so
the
question
is
when
congress
changed
the
language
to
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
did
it
mean
lacks
removal
jurisdiction?
which
it--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
it
would
not
have.
but
that's
because
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
difference
between
original
jurisdiction
under
the
fsia,
section
1330(a),
and
removal
jurisdiction
under
the
fsia.
whereas
original
jurisdiction
depends
upon
a
conclusion
that
the
defendant
is
not
immune,
congress
conferred
removal
jurisdiction
whenever
a
foreign
sovereign
is
defended.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
likewise
in
1442(a),
which
was
about
the
federal--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
immunity
argument
could
be
raised
in
state
court.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
kircher.
but
the
defendant
would
be
forever
denied
its
right
to
a
bench
trial
under
federal
law.
that
right
is
limited
to
suits
in
the
federal
courts
by
its
term;
1441(d)--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
state--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
state
court
could
reconsider
powerex's
status
as
a
foreign
sovereign,
but
it
wouldn't
have
many,
if
any,
implications
in
the
state
court
because
powerex
isn't
claiming
immunity
in
this
case.
it's
only
invoking
the
procedural
benefits
of
the
fsia
which
include
that
the
case
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court
before
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury.
and
it
would
be
forever
denied
the
benefits,
those
important
procedural
benefits
of
the
statute
if
this
court
doesn't
uphold
review
of
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
issue
of
immunity
of
powerex
was
never
raised
in
this
case.
it
can
review
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
organ
of
the
state
it
but
it
cannot
review
the
remand
determination
that
powerex
can
never
be
granted
the
procedural
benefits
of
federal
foreign
order
bench
trial.
thanks,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier

simon.
