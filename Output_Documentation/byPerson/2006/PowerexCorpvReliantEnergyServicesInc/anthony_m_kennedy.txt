then
can
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can,
can
you
tell
me,
if
the
petitioner
does
not
prevail
here,
the
case
goes
back
to
the
state
court.
can
the
immunity
argument
be
raised
in
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words
the
state
court
couldn't
say
well
you
know,
this
district
court
was
wrong;
there's
really
immunity
under
the
federal
statute.
the
state
court
can't
hold
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
then
you'd
have
constant...
eternal
shuttling
back
and
forth,
that's
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the...
the
federal
determination
bars
the
state
court
from
redetermining
that
there's
immunity?
that
the
state
court
can't
say,
"federal
court,
you're
wrong"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
having,
i'm
having
the
same
problem
as
justice
alito
and
justice
breyer.
can
you
say
in
just
a
few
sentences
the
difference
between
the
case
where
there
is
sovereign
immunity,
china,
the
china
hypothetical,
and
this
case
where
it's
organ
immunity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
telling
us
that
one
is
more
important
than
the
other,
but
there's
no
textual
basis
in
the
statute
for
us
to
make
that
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
why
is
denial
of
immunity
for
sovereign
status
different
from
denial
of
organ
status
giving
you
a
right
to
a
bench
trial,
etcetera?
