justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
saying
this
all
turns
on
our
assessment
of
the
strength
of
the
interest
in
remaining
in
federal
court?
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
could
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
argument
you
were
making
a
few
minutes
ago,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
was
that
b.c.
hydro
would
not
have
been
barred
by
1447(d)
from
taking
an
appeal
to
contest
the
remand;
is
that
correct
or
not.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
whether
it's
a
collateral
order
or
not
just
goes
to
whether
it
falls
under
1291.
it
doesn't
speak
at
all
to
the
issue
of
1447.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
difference
between
that
immunity
and
powerex's
status
is
what?
it's
simply
the
fact
that
there's
a
stronger
interest
in
allowing
immediate
appellate
review,
federal
appellate
review
of
the
determination
of
the
remand
of
a
party
that
claims
to
be
a
sovereign
as
opposed
to
powerex's
status
as
an
organ?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
think
that
powerex,
that
there's
a
strong
interest
in
having
powerex
remain
in
federal
court
if
it's
entitled
to
that
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
that
would
be
suffer
to
get
around
1447(d)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
reason
why
they
may
have
done
that
is
because
they've
seen
case
after
case
where
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely.
and
because
district
judges
know
that
remand
orders
are
not
reviewable,
on
occasion
they
will
remand
cases
for
reasons
that
are
clearly
improper.
that
may
be
the
reason.
now
on
your
first
argument,
you
say
that
what
the
district
judge
says
is
dispositive.
you
mean
if
the
district
judge
says
i
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
my
docket
is
crowded,
that's
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that's
not--
