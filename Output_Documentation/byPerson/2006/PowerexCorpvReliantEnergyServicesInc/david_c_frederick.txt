mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1988,
the
government
of
british
columbia
created
powerex
to
perform
a
variety
of
public
functions
including
the
marketing
of
surplus
hydropower
generated
by
development
of
the
province's
natural
resources
pursuant
to
bilateral
agreements
with
the
united
states.
the
ninth
circuit,
however,
denied
powerex
its
rightful
status
as
an
organ
of
a
foreign
state
entitled
to
remove
this
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
before
addressing
the
appellate
jurisdiction
issue,
i'd
like
to
highlight
briefly
the
two
key
errors
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
rejecting
powerex's
organ
status.
first,
the
court
articulated
the
wrong
test
for
determining
an
entity's
status
as
an
organ
of
a
foreign
state.
the
factors
the
ninth
circuit
found
dispositive
are
inconsistent
with
the
fsia;
and
second,
the
court
overlooked
crucial
evidence
of
powerex's
public
functions
that
are
the
best
indication
of
its
sovereign
status.
the
british
columbia
government
receives
and
distributes
the
proceeds
from
powerex's
operations,
supervises
powerex
through
bc
hydro,
subjects
powerex
to
provincial
laws
not
applicable
to
private
companies
and
grants
powerex
special
benefits
including
exemption
from
taxation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
let
me
address
that
now.
the
court's...
the
district
court's
remand
order
was
appealable
because
it
was
not
issued
under
1447(c).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
district
court
made
two
mutually
exclusive
statements,
that
remand
was
proper
and
that
it
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
because
of
that
inconsistency,
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sorry.
that
removal
was
proper
under
the
sovereign
removal
provisions
of
1441(d)
and
1442(a).
it
also
then
said
it
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
immunity
was
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
thinking
that
it
had
to
remand.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
what
this
court's
cases
say,
justice
souter,
is
that
the
remand
has
to
be
a
ground
cognizable
under
1447(c).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
certainly
do--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
thermtron
rule
has
been
reaffirmed
no
less
than
four
times
by
this
court,
notwithstanding
two
statutory
amendments.
it
has
been
reaffirmed
and
stare
decisis
on
the
basis
of
statute
is
the
strongest
form
of
stare
decisis.
so
i
do--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
thermtron
rule
was
reaffirmed
earlier
this
term
in
the
osborn
case,
has
been
reaffirmed
in
prior
cases
lead...
from
the
time
it
was
decided
even
through
statutory
amendments.
our
submission
is
that
if
congress
intended
to
change
that
rule,
it
could
have
done
so
clearly.
and
we
note
that
the
respondents
here
don't
ask
for
thermtron
to
be
overruled,
and
it
is
clear
from
the
amicus
on
their
side,
that
the
only
way
you
could
rule
in
favor
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
would
be
to
overrule
thermtron.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
here,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction
because
removal
was
properly
effectuated
once
the
entities
that
we
moved
were
identified
correctly
as
sovereigns,
either
foreign
sovereigns
in
the
case
of
bc
hydro,
or
federal
sovereigns
in
the
case
of
bpa.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
you're
not,
justice
scalia,
and
here's
why.
immunity
is
not
a
ground
for
remand
because
it
is
not
a
precondition
for
a
removal
by
a
sovereign.
it
is
a
separate
freestanding
issue.
it
is
a
status
determination
that
determines
whether
removal
is
proper
by
those
sovereigns.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
if
in
thermtron
the
court,
the
district
court
had
said
my
docket
is
too
busy,
i
therefore
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
remand
under
1447(c),
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
the
courts
would
look
beyond
the
label
given.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
speaking
hypothetically,
justice
ginsburg.
my
point
is
that
the
label
the
district
court
attached
here
was
the
wrong
label,
and
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals
to
satisfy--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
remand
orders
have
no
preclusive
effect
to
remand
a
case
on
the
ground
that
the
sovereigns
are
immune,
and
force
them
to
relitigate
their
immune
status
in
state
court.
that
is
precisely
why
congress
enacted
these
sovereign
removal
provisions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
our
backup
submission,
justice
souter.
you
do
not
need
to
reach
that
if
you
agree
with
our
principal
submission
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
justice
souter,
it
did
so.
the
case...
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
so
have
always
been
grounds...
jurisdictional
grounds
cognizable
under
1447(c).
immunity
from
suit
is
not
such
a
ground,
because
the
purpose
of
having
the
removal
provision
on
the
basis
of
status
is
to
allow
the
federal
courts
to
decide
the
immunity
status.
if
the
court
sends
the
case
back
to
state
court
on
immunity
grounds,
it
does
not
have
preclusive
effect
in
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
will
be
obliged
to
relitigate
sovereign
immunity
status
and
there
will
be
no
recourse
except
through
appeal
through
the
state
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
justice
scalia,
that's
not
our
backup
argument.
our
point
is
that
in
this
case,
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
the
successful
removals,
which
everybody
conceded
were
correct,
that
the
label
that
it
attached,
immunity
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
is
not
a
label
for
a
ground
recognized
in
1447(c).
so
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
exercise
appellate
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
remand
was
a
mandatory
remand
under
1447(c)
or
a
discretionary
one
of
the
type
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
cohill
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
believe
that
we
did,
justice
ginsburg.
this
case
was
remanded.
a
motion...
motions
for
clarification
were
subsequently
brought.
but
a
1292(b)
order
was
not
requested
by
powerex.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
in
searching
through
the
docket
entries,
you'll
discover
that
there
was
a
holding
by
the
district
court
of
the
remand,
which
is
in
itself
an
unusual
procedure.
but
the
point
that
is
important
here
is
that
even
apart
from
that,
when
the
court
had
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
removal
provisions,
it
did
not
lose
subject
matter
jurisdiction
by
finding
the
immunity
claims
upon
the
part
of
the
federal
and
foreign
sovereigns.
and
it
is
their
theory
that
the
district
court
never
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
that
has
to
be
wrong
because
it
conflicts
with
the
purposes
behind
the
removal
provision
to
give
the
sovereigns
the
opportunity
to
litigate
their
immunity
defenses
in
federal
court.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
their
submission
in
this
court,
however,
is
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
their
backup
argument
should
be
rejected
by
the
court
as
wrong.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
there's
no
provision--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--by
the
time
the
appeals
in
the
state
court
would
have
been
exhausted,
the
very
benefits--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
would
certainly
make
the
argument.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
i
would
not
want
to
foreclose
any
arguments
that
we
might
try
to
make;
but
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
years
that
it
would
take
to
march
through
the
state
court
system,
powerex,
as
a
sovereign,
would
be
denied
its
right
to
have
a
bench
trial--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
do
think
foreign
sovereigns
are
different,
and
congress
intended
to
treat--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
foreign
sovereign
is
entitled
to
a
bench
trial.
it
is
entitled
to
other
procedural
protections
with
respect
to
treatment
of
garnishment,
other--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
would
be
after...
it
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
of
having
congress
enact
these
removal
provisions
and
to
ensure
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
for
sovereigns
on
the
basis
of
their
status
is
entirely
to
vindicate
those
rights
and
interests.
if
powerex
were
sued
for
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--diversity
is
different,
justice
scalia,
and
here's
why.
when
a
case
is
removed
on
diversity
grounds,
the
court
of
appeals...
the
district
court
is
obliged
to
examine
the
bases
of
diversity.
that
is
what
the
court's
removal
duty
is.
when
a
foreign
sovereign
removes
a
case,
the
district
court's
duty
is
to
determine
is
this
a
foreign
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
fsia.
if
it
is,
i
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
we
would
win
at
all
in
that
circumstance
because
we
would
be
forced
as
a
foreign
state
to
litigate
in
state
court
contrary
to
congress's
will.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
whatever
arguments
that
may
be
preserved--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
certainly
not
impossible,
but
the
point--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
unclear
to
me,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
seen
any
of
this
court's
cases
that
would
suggest
that
the
denial
of
that
kind
of
procedural
right
would
be
grounds
for
reversing
a
state
court
judgment.
and
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
bench
trial
right,
the
immunity
defenses
of
a
foreign
sovereign,
because
the
organ
status
questioned--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
recall
whether
the
defendants
do,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the
case
has
settled,
justice
ginsburg,
prior
to
the
formal
invocation
of
trial
procedures,
and
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
explained
in
the
cert
petition
papers,
the
case
is
on
appeal
in
the
state
court
system
on
objections
to
the
settlement,
and
it
will
not
be
mooted
during
the
course
of
this
court's
action
on
the
case.
but
the
invocation
of
jury
that
would
be
done
normally
just
before
trial
has
not
been
an
issue
that's
been
presented.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
what
the
plaintiffs
here
assert
is
that
they
would
be
denied
their
right
to
jury
trial,
and
i
presume
that
that
means
they
intend
to
ask
for
one
and
to
perpetuate
that
request.
our
position,
as
we
explain
in
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief,
is
that
they
have
a
jury
trial
right
as
against
duke
and
reliant;
they
do
not
as
against
the
foreign
sovereigns
that
they
have
sued.
so
at
root,
the
case
is
about
the
kind
of
comity
and
dignity
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
will
accord
to
foreign
sovereigns.
if
powerex
were
sued
on
the
basis
of
non-commercial
acts,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
have
its
immunity
defense
vindicated
if
the
district
court
is
held
to
have
no
jurisdiction,
notwithstanding
the
proper
removal
under
1441(d).
i'd
like
to
save
the
reminder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
a
non-jury
trial
is
an
aspect
of
sovereign
immunity.
this
court's
cases
have
recognized
that.
in
footnote
6
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
cites
the
lehman
case
which
makes
this
point
clear
and
argues
that
the
point
should
be
applicable
to
sovereigns
in
the
context
in
which
we
are
faced
here.
the
question
of
whether
a
foreign
entity,
and
it's
more
complicated
often
in
the
real
world,
justice
breyer,
as
your
question's
identified
not
simply
with
questions
but
with
the
kinds
of
entities
that
foreign
governments
create
to
advance
public
purposes.
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
have
those
kinds
of
entities
tested
in
state
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
enjoyed
the
privileges
and
procedural
protections
of
the
fsia.
and
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
whether
or
not
an
elderly
judge
might
choose
to
recognize
china
or
formosa,
but
rather
the
kinds
of
instrumentalities
that
were
created
by
those
governments
to
advance
public
purposes,
to
serve
as
separate
political
entities,
and
who
would
be
performing
the
kinds
of
acts
that
might
lead
them
into
litigation,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
not
all
that's
at
stake,
justice
ginsburg.
there
are
also
rights
with
respect
to
foreign
states
to
be
free
of
punitive
damages.
there
are
rights
to
have
certain
property
of
the
sovereign
that
would
be
subject
to
different
attachment
rules.
the
fsia
has
a
whole
string
of
procedural
protections
that
are
afforded
to
foreign
states
and
their
instrumentalities.
and
this
case
ultimately
is
about
the
fact
that
powerex
is
being
subjected
to
multiple
suits
in
state
court,
but
as
a
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
have
been
directly
sued
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
whom
my
brother
here
represents.
they
have
been
sued
by
the
california
attorney
general.
they
have
been
sued
by
the
california
department
of
water
resources.
and
under
the
ninth
circuit's
precedent
in
this
case
which
i
urge
you
to
overturn,
powerex
has
been
remanded
to
state
court,
has
not
been
permitted
to
appeal
the
remand
order,
and
is
stuck
in
state
court
in
these
cases
without
any
opportunity
to
test
what
is
a
clearly
erroneous,
and
what
my
brother
doesn't
make
any
attempt
to
defend,
the
merits
of
the
decision,
that
powerex
has
performed
public
functions,
it's
serving
at
the
direction
of
the
government
of
british
columbia,
and
is
performing
these
functions
to
advance
clearly
public
purposes.
and
yet,
we
are
now
in
this
kafkaesque
work
world
between
state
and
federal
court
where
if
we
try
to
litigate
all
the
way
up
through
state
court,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
we
will
ever
have
our
organ...
our
status
as
a
foreign
organ
ever
vindicated.
thank
you.
