mr.
frederick,
may
i
just
follow
up
on
justice
breyer's
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
suggests
that
you
have
two
bites
at
the
apple
because
you...
all
the
way
along,
you
might
win.
and
if
you
won,
then
it
wouldn't
matter.
if
you
lose,
you
always
have
the
argument
that
you've
made
here,
let's
go
back
and
start
over
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
might
win
that
litigation.
it's
not
impossible,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
lose,
you
always
have
a
point
on
appeal
and
may
start
all
over
again
later
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
help
me
with--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
want
to
be
sure
your
position.
assume
that
there
is
a
remand
that
was
improper
and
cannot
be
appealed
under
your
theory
and
the
powerex
argues
all
along,
i
was
entitled
to
a
federal
forum
and
a
non-jury
trial.
and
the
state
court
says
no
all
the
way
up.
can
they
file
a
petition
for
certiorari
saying,
we
had
a
federal
right
that
was
denied
us,
not
the
remand
but
our
entitlement
to
a
bench
trial?
can
they
petition
for
certiorari
at
the
end
of
the
state
proceeding
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
position
is.
