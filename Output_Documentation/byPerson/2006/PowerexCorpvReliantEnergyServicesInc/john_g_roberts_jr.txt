chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
05-85,
powerex
corporation
versus
reliant
energy
services.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
cases
are
all...
all
based
on
thermtron.
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that
thermtron
would
come
out
the
other
way
today,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
light
of,
in
light
of
the
statutory
language
as
it
exists
now?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
stare
decisis
on
the
basis
of
statute
is
kind
of
a
weak
basis
when
the
statute's
been
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
purely...
pure
question
begging.
i
mean,
the
whole
issue
on
the
merits
is
whether
it's
a
foreign
sovereign
or
not.
and
you
can't
assume
that
you're
correct
when
the
remand
provision
or
the
provision
barring
appeal
when
it's
been
remanded
doesn't
care
whether
you're
correct.
the
idea
is,
you
can
get
a
correct
determination
in
state
court
through
up
to
review
by
this
court
eventually,
as
you
can
in
federal
court.
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
federal
court
is
the
only
place
you
would
get
a
correct
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what...
what
do
you
do
about
1447(e)
which
says
that
if
after
removal
joinder
might
defeat
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
court
can
deny
joinder
or
permit
joinder
and
remand
the
action.
in
other
words,
you
have
got
subject
matter
jurisdiction
but
the
statute
contemplates
it
may...
later...
later
you
may
lose
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
you
can
remand
it
there.
and
i
suppose
that
that
needs
to
be
interpreted
in
pari
materia
with
(c)
so
that
the
remands
would
not
be
subject
to
review.
it
seems
to
me
the
same
situation
here.
you
have
got
allegedly
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
is
later
defeated,
and
it
is
remanded.
why
shouldn't
that
be
covered
by
(c)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that
a
remand
under
1447(e)
would
be
covered
by
1447(d),
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
it's
a
good
thing
you've
got
a
lot
of
fallback
arguments
because
you
fall
back
very
quickly.
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
justice
alito
would
be,
the
statute
says
if
it's
remanded,
it's
not
reviewable
on
appeal
or
otherwise.
and
if
it's
remanded
for
a
silly
reason,
that
will
be
corrected
on
review
of
the
state
supreme
court
by
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
certainly
changes
the
argument.
so
the
notice
of
appeal
that's
filed
or
the
brief
on
appeal
says
not
only
was
the
court
wrong,
it
was
patently
wrong,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
consider
that
before
determining
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
remand
order.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
simon.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
05-85
powerex
corporation
versus
reliant
energy.
