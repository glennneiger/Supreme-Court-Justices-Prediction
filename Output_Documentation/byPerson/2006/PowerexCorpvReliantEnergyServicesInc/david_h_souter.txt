mr.
frederick,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
1447(d)
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
point
it
was
acting
it
was
remanding,
and
its
basis
for
remanding
was
not
that
it
thought
the
removal
had
been
proper;
the
basis
for
its
remanding
was
that
it
said
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
three
of
the
other
cross
defendants.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
have
been,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
it
may
have
been
wrong.
but
what
it
thought
it
was
doing
it
seems
to
me
is
fairly
clearly
remanding
for
a
jurisdictional
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
you
are
really
arguing
for
is,
in
effect,
a
separate
rule,
and
that
is
that
1447(d)
has
an
exception
when
we
are
dealing
with
foreign
sovereign
immunities.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
trouble
with
the
principal
submission,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
we
have
said
that
even
if
the
district
court
has
come
to
an
erroneous
conclusion
about
jurisdiction,
if
it
understands
that
it
is
making
a
jurisdictional
ruling,
that
is
not
appealable.
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
how
they
would
get
up
on
it,
assuming
they
could
get
up
on
the
immunity
question,
our
series
of
questions
is
why
do
we
draw
or
why
should
we
draw
a
distinction
between
immunity
and
federal
bench
trial?
and
your
answer
is,
i
take
it,
immunity
is
dispositive;
federal
bench
trial
is
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
effect
he
would
say...
i
mean,
i
assume
what
the
clever
lawyer
would
say
is,
you,
state
court,
cannot
try
me
at
all.
the
feds
can
do
what
they
want
about
remand
and
it
gets
back
here.
but
because
i'm
entitled
to
a
bench
trial,
you
cannot
try
me
at
all.
isn't
that
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
ultimately
when
the
two
clever
parties
got
to
the
state
supreme
court,
they
would
have
these
two
opposing
issues
and
ultimately
if
we
granted
cert
this
court
would
decide
it,
wouldn't
it.
