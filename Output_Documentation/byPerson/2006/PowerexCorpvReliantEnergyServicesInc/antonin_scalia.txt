removal.
removal
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
said
remand
was
proper.
that's
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we
go
into
that
question
all
the
time,
1447(d)
is
a
nullity.
i
mean,
if
in
every
case
you're
going
to
be
able
to
appeal
whether
indeed
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
appeal
every
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
fine
if
1447(d)
said
that
there
is
no
appeal
so
long
as
the
basis
for
removal
was
proper,
but
that's
not
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
into
your
backup
argument
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
backup
argument
that
you're
now
making,
that
not
your
principal
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
care
whether
it
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
not.
it's
not
an
essential
part
of
their
case.
their
case
is
even
if
it
did,
it
mistakenly
thought
it
didn't,
and
remand
it,
end
of
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
their
backup
argument,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
the
same
with
diversity
jurisdiction.
you
can
make
the
same
argument.
there's
nothing
distinctive
here.
this
statute
says
that
in
a
foreign
sovereign
immunity
case
you
have
a
right
to
be
tried
in
federal
court.
fine.
but
the
statute
also
says
that
if
you're
a
defendant
in
a
diversity
suit,
you
have
a
right
to
trial
in
federal
court.
and
i
don't
know
why
this
is
any
more
demanding
of
an
exception
to
1447(d)
than
is
ordinary
diversity
jurisdiction,
where
congress
has
said
you're
entitled
to
trial
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
that
relevant
here?
where
is
the
post-removal
event?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
an
event.
that's...
that's
an
epiphany,
it's
not
an
event.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
very
strange
meaning
of
event.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
the
sovereign
immunity
didn't
exist
from
the
outset.
nothing
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
it
say
that?
i
really
find
it
very
hard
to
accept
that
argument,
when
its
says...
you
know...
it
doesn't
use
lacks
removal
jurisdiction,
that's
what
it
means.
it
is
such
an
easy
thing
to
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i,...
i'm
not
sure
it
is
even
that
he
made
a
mistake.
it
is
even
worse
than
that.
if
he
gets
it
right
and
finds
that
you
are
a
sovereign--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
go
back
to
state
court.
i
mean,
that's
even
worse.
he
gets
it
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
his
clever
opponent
would
say--
[laughter]
--that
what
1447(d)
means
is
that
you
can
be
tried
in
state
courts.
that's
precisely
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
recommend
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
plaintiff’s
respondents
filed
a
suit
in
state
courts
alleging
that
various
companies
in
california’s
energy
market
had
conspired
to
fix
prices
in
violation
of
state
law.
some
of
the
defendants
filed
cross-claims
seeking
indemnity
from
among
other
entities
two
federal
agencies
bc
hydro
a
canadian
corporation
that
is
wholly
owned
by
british-columbia
and
thus
is
a
“foreign
state”
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
petitioner
powerex
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
bc
hydro.
these
four
cross-defendants
removed
the
entire
case
to
federal
court
with
bc
hydro
and
the
petitioner
here
powerex
relying
on
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
which
permits
removal
by
foreign
sovereigns.
the
plaintiff’s
respondents
moved
to
remand
the
case
back
to
state
court
arguing
that
petitioner
powerex
was
not
a
foreign
state
under
fsia
and
does
not
entitled
to
remove
to
federal
court,
and
that
the
claims
against
the
other
three
removing
defendants
the
two
federal
agencies
and
bc
hydro
a
foreign
state
were
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
the
district
court
agreed
and
remanded
the
entire
case.
as
relevant
here
petitioner
appealed
arguing
that
it
was
a
foreign
sovereign
under
fsia.
the
plaintiff’s
respondents
rejoin
that
the
appeal
was
jurisdictionally
barred
by
28
u.s.c
§1447(d)
which
provides
“an
order
remanding
a
case
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed,
is
not
reviewable
on
appeal,
or
otherwise.”
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
§1447(d)
did
not
precluded
from
considering
petitioner’s
appeal
but
it
then
rejected
the
appeal
on
the
merits.
affirming
the
district
court’s
determination
that
petitioner
was
not
a
“foreign
state”
within
the
meaning
of
fsia.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
petitioner
is
a
foreign
state
but
we
also
ask
the
parties
to
address
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
that
appellate
jurisdiction
existed
not
withstanding
§1447(d).
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
relevant
part
and
hold
that
§1447(d)
barred
review
of
petitioner’s
appeal.
as
i
described
earlier
§1447(d)
provides
“an
order
remanding
a
case
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed
is
not
reviewable
on
appeal
or
otherwise.”
despite
this
seeming
categorical
language
our
cases
have
interpreted
the
provision
in
a
more
limited
fashion.
we
have
read
§1447(d)
in
pari
materia
with
§1447(c),
so
that
only
remand
based
on
the
grounds
specified
in
§1447(c)
are
shielded
from
review
by
§1447(d).
what
that
means
for
this
case
given
the
language
of
§1447(c)
and
the
proceedings
below
is
that
§1447(d)
bars
review
only
if
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
based
on
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
at
the
outset,
we
reject
petitioner’s
claim
that
a
case
cannot
be
remanded
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
§1447(c)
if
the
case
was
properly
removed
in
the
first
place.
section
1447(c)
contains
no
such
limitation
in
its
text
and
its
statutory
history
conclusively
refutes
it.
we
hold
that
when
a
district
court
remands
a
properly
removed
case
because
it
nonetheless
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
the
remand
is
covered
by
§1447(c)
and
shield
it
from
review
by
§1447(d).
of
course,
that
still
requires
us
to
determine
whether
the
district
court
in
this
case
remanded
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
one
thing
leads
to
another.
as
an
initial
matter
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
court
was
purporting
to
remand
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
we
have
never
decided
whether
§1447(d)
permits
an
appellate
court
to
look
behind
the
district
court’s
characterization
of
the
ground
upon
which
it
is
remanding
that
is
in
the
context
of
the
present
case
to
determine
whether
the
district
court
was
correct,
that
if
powerex
was
not
a
foreign
sovereign
and
the
other
cross
defendants
had
sovereign
immunity
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
claims
against
powerex.
while
we
do
not
definitively
resolve
that
question
today
we
do
hold
that
such
review
if
permitted
at
all
is
limited
to
insuring
that
the
characterization
as
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
was
colorable.
because
the
ground
upon
which
the
district
court
based
its
remand
was
at
least
arguably
jurisdiction
will
naturally
hold
that
§1447(d)
bars
appellate
review.
so,
we
never
will
reach
the
point
of
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
that
powerex
was
not
a
foreign
sovereign.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
§1447(d)
does
not
preclude
reviewing
a
district
court’s
substantive
determinations
that
precede
a
remand
order
to
whit
it
substantive
determination
that
powerex
was
not
a
foreign
sovereign.
that
holding
appears
to
be
premised
on
our
decision
in
waco
versus
united
states
fidelity
&
guaranty
company
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
relying
on
waco
because
that
case
does
not
permit
an
appeal
when
as
here
there
is
no
order
separate
from
the
un-reviewable
remand
order.
finally,
we
reject
petitioner’s
contention
that
congress
did
not
intend
§1447(d)
to
govern
suits
properly
removed
under
fsia
that
argument
is
flatly
refuted
by
a
long
standing
precedent
back
to
court
from
one
of
our
cases
absent
a
clear
statutory
comment
to
the
contrary
we
assume
that
congress
is
aware
of
the
universality
of
the
practice
of
denying
appellate
review
of
remand
orders
when
congress
creates
a
new
ground
for
removal.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
accordingly
vacated
in
part
and
the
case
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss
petitioner’s
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
