mr.
leonard
b.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
reasons,
independent
and
sufficient
reasons
why
there
is
in
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
first
most
narrow
and
simple
reason
to
vacate
the
decision
below
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
is
to
follow
this
court's
precedents
which
accept
the
district
court's
remand
order
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
says
it
is,
a
remand
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
1447(c),
unremovable
under
1447(d).
that
is
a
simple
direct
route
to
that
result.
there
is
a
second
approach
suggested
by
a
lot
of
the
briefing
and
some
of
the
argument
your
honors
have
heard
this
morning.
and
i
want
to
lay
it
out
briefly
for
the
court.
and
it
is
that,
as
the
law
professor
amici
have
suggested,
there
is
some
amount
of
confusion
in
the
lower
courts,
i
might
say
with
due
respect,
evasion
of
1447(d)
in
the
lower
courts,
by
judge-made
exceptions
to
1447(d),
created
by
some
but
not
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
and
the
court
could
clear
out
some
of
this
underbrush,
mooting
many
of
the
issues
that
mr.
frederick
and
the
that
solicitor
general
have
raised.
thermtron
after
carnegie
mellon,
addressing
the
question
justice
kennedy
raised
in
his
concurring
opinion,
in
things
remembered
versus
petrarca,
thermtron
does
not
say
what
many
of
the
lower
courts
think
it
does.
thermtron
does
not
say
what
my
adversaries
say
it
does,
because
thermtron
has
been
partially
overruled
by
carnegie
mellon.
the
notion
that
the
only
proper
remand
is
a
1447(c)
remand
is
ancient
history
after
carnegie
mellon,
and
therefore
the
notion
that
the
only
remand
covered
by
1447(d)
is
a
remand
under
1447(c)
is
also
ancient
history.
congress
has
given
us
a
simple
and
strong
message,
which
is
when
we're
disputing
the
forum,
when
the
parties
in
a
case
are
legitimately
and
in
good
faith
disputing
forum,
state
court
versus
federal
court,
congress
has
said
take
one
shot
at
it,
let
an
article
iii
judge
determine
whether
the
forum
is
state
court
or
federal
court,
and
move
on
to
the
merits.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
it--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--let
me
try
to
answer
it--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--let
me
try
to
answer
both
questions.
the
problem
is
whether
he
gets
it
right
or
wrong,
we
spend
two
years
in
a
court
of
appeals.
but
your
honor,
you're
assuming
there's
an
immunity
issue
in
this
case.
with
due
respect,
my
adversaries
are
arguing
someone
else's
case.
there
is
no
immunity
claim
in
this
case
by
powerex.
there
is
one
petition,
one
petitioner.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
they
were
saying
they
were
an
organ.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
no.
they
conceded
that
they
fell
within
the
exception.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
i
would
disagree
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
a
party
who
has
total
immunity--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--would
have
removed
the
case
the
same
way--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--and
it
would
have
presented
two
arguments
to
the
district
court.
it
would
have
argued
number
one,
we
are
a
foreign
sovereign;
maybe
it
wins,
maybe
it
loses.
and
number
two.
we
are
immune.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
there
is
a
solid
line
of
cases
that
suggests
the
decision
on
immunity...
first
of
all
let
me
say,
i
think
it
is
somewhat
far-fetched
that
a
party
that
would
actually
be
immune,
say
the
king
of
saudi
arabia,
would
end
up
being
in
this
third
lowest
category
of
foreign...
purported
foreign
sovereigns
and
end
up
in
the
position
powerex
is
in.
but
if
it
did,
in
other
words
we
have
three
categories.
we
have
immunes,
we
have
non-immunes
who
got
federal
court,
and
then
we
have
would-be
foreign
sovereigns
like
powerex,
who
end
up
in
state
court.
and
i'm
suggesting
for
a
party
to
fall
from
the
first
category
to
the
third
in
front
of
an
article
iii
judge--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--makes
a
big
mistake.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
the
question
has
never
been
addressed
by
this
court.
the
lower
courts
suggest
that
that
is
a
collateral
order.
the
immunity
issue,
not
the
remand
issue.
we
actually
now
have
a
waco
type
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
the
immunity--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--in
my
view,
the
immunity
issue,
but
not
the
remand
is
reviewable
on
appeal--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--right.
and
the
difference
is--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--the
difference
is
that
the
immunity
issue
is
reviewed
on
appeal
because
there
is
a
line
of
court
of
appeal
cases...
a
majority,
not
a
unanimous
majority,
never
blessed
by
this
court...
which
suggests
that
immunity
is
so
important,
don't
need
a
lawyer,
you
don't
go
to
court,
you
don't
say
a
word,
you
don't
spend
a
dollar,
you
walk
away...
so
important
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
immediate--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
well,
i
want
to
come
back
non-jury
trial
and
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
because
i
don't
think
she
got
the
right
answer.
but
the
reason
it's
more
important
is
this
is,
as
justice
scalia
said,
like
a
diversity
decision,
this
is
a
litigation
who
sells
power
in
the
pacific
northwest
and
admits
that
it
competes
with
enron,
duke,
and
reliant,
and
it
is
disputing
whether
it
belongs
in
a
state
court
in
san
diego
or
the
federal
court
across
the
street
in
san
diego,
leaving
aside
the
jury
issue.
and
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
dispute
that
congress
suggested
in
1447(d)
and
its
predecessors,
which
have
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
100
years,
ought
to
be
done
once.
what
do
they
say,
one
and
done?
is
that
what
they
say
in
the
district
court?
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
no,
it
turns
on
the
strength
of
getting
an
immediate
decision
on
the
immunity
question.
the
immunity
question
i
think
is
a
question
of
an
entirely
different
nature
than
the
question
of
forum.
in
the--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--that's
correct.
but
congress
said,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
federal
forum
and
a
bench
tribal
if
you
convince
us
that
you
are
an
agency
or
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state.
this,
this
corporation
powerex
failed
to
make
that
convincing
showing.
having
failed
to
make
that
convincing
showing,
again,
they
are
debating
in
the
appellate
courts
and
tying
litigants
up
for
two,
five
years
over
whether
this
case
should
be
litigated
in
state
court
or
in
federal
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
b.c.
hydro.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
immune,
properly
followed
the
law,
but
determined
because
it
believed
it
had
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
it
should
then
stop
at
that
point,
that
it
should
just
walk
away
from
the
case
and
remand
it,
over
the
vehement
disagreement
of
b.c.
hydro
and
the
parallel
vehement
disagreement
of
the
bonneville
power
administration.
the
ninth
circuit
when
it
erroneously
took
the
appeal
on
the
remand
also
clarified
or
straightened
out
that
issue.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
well,
what's
happened
so
far
is
nothing,
which
might
tell
us
that
in
the
practical
world
when
a
federal
district
judge
says
that
b.c.
hydro
is
immune
and
then
remands
a
multi-plaintiff,
multi-defendant,
multi-cross
defendant
case
to
san
diego
superior
court,
it
is
exceedingly
that
the
san
diego
superior
court
will
reconsider
the
immunity.
but
if
it
did--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--i
suppose
it
could,
but
if
it
did
that
matter
is
subject
to
appeal
and
subject
to
ultimate
certiorari
review
in
this
court.
so
i
think
we're
talking
about
a
frolic.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
i
think
b.c.
hydro
could
have
taken
a
collateral
order,
a
collateral
order
appeal.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
b.c.
hydro
could
have
attempted
to
appeal
the
immunity
decision
under
a
series
of
decisions
which
suggest
that
immunity
is
so
important
that
it
ought
to
be
decided
right
then.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
among
several
other
things.
there
is
a
stronger
interest
in
that,
and
we
are
not
debating
about
the
forum.
again,
we
have
the
kircher
case
from
last
term
saying
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
resolving
this
issue.
that
is
a
quotation
actually
from
the
missouri
pacific
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
i
think
justice
scalia
was
correct
to
say
there
is
just
as
strong
an
interest
in
a
diversity
case
in
having
a
new
york
corporation
trying
to
escape--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--yes,
if
i
could--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--i
think
there
are
two
differences,
so
if
i
could.
one
is
textual
and
one
is
important.
let
me
start
with
the
textual
difference.
the
textual
difference
is
that
1447(d)
speaks
to
remands,
and
so
to
the
extent
the
district
court
remanded
the
matter
to
state
court
the
remand
is
untouchable
on
appeal
or
by
mandamus
because
of
1447(d).
and
if
the
foreign...
if
the
foreign
relations
body,
lobby,
doesn't
like
that,
if
the
state
department
doesn't
like,
that
they
can
go
to
the
capitol
and
get
that
fixed
quite
easily.
there
are
half
a
dozen
exceptions
to
1447(d)
for
class
actions,
for
native
americans,
for
civil
rights
cases,
and
they
can
get
their
own
exceptions.
so
to
the
extent
what
the
trial
court
did
was
remand,
it
is
untouchable.
that
is
my
textual
answer.
it's
a
remand,--
i.e.
waco,
in
which
the
court
says
the
remand
is
untouchable,
the
dismissal
of
the
unnecessary
or
indispensable
party
is
reviewable.
so
what
i
would
say
is,
although
the
remand
is
untouchable,
the
denial
of
immunity...
and
that's
why
i
kept
saying
collateral
order;
i
apologize
if
that
confused
you,
justice
alito.
i
meant
that
line
of
cases
about
going
straight
up
even
though
the
case
was
continuing.
while
the
case
continues
in
state
court,
where
it
belongs
under
1447(d),
it
would
appear
under
this
line
of
collateral
order
cases
that
the
denial
of
immunity
per
se
could
go
up
on
its
own--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--possibly,
possibly
this
court
would
decide
that
question
the
other
way.
but--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
but
not
the
remand.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
but
not
the
remand.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
the
first
difference
is
what
i
said
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
was
i
think
they
could
do
that
under
some
cases
from
the
courts
of
appeal.
i
know
they
can't
appeal
the
remand
because
we
have
an
act
of
congress
which--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--justice
breyer,
think
about
a
multi-party
case
and
maybe
my
answer
will
be
clearer
to
you.
in
a
multi-party
case
my
position
is
the
remand
stands,
the
case
goes
back
to
missouri
or
mississippi
or
wherever
your
hypothetical
was,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
do
believe
that
the
potentially
immune
party,
which
is
not
here
in
this
courtroom
today,
the
potentially
immune
party,
could
seek
to
review
of
what
is
a
dispositive
ruling.
remember,
that's
a
dispositive
ruling.
they
win
the
case.
that's
very
different
than
a
venue
ruling.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
immunity
is
dispositive
and
federal
bench
trial
is
not...
and
is
no
different
from
the
day
to
day
decisions
district
courts
make
all
the
time
about
the
choice
between
a
state
court
and
a
federal
court
in
the
area
of
remands
and
removals.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
and
that
is
my
core--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--excuse
me.
that
is
my
core
point,
that
congress
told
us
when
the
only
question
is
where,
we
stop
after
one
level
and
we
move
on
to
the
merits.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question
about
a
jury,
but
i
think
i
interrupted
justice
stevens.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
other
than
the
jury
question,
i
think
the
answer
would
be
no
because
of
1447(d),
because
i
think
1447(d)
would
suggest
that
that's
an
appeal
of
a
remand.
but
again,
you're
asking
questions
that
i
believe
have
not
been
addressed
by
this
court
or
even
lower
courts.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
a
clever
enough
lawyer
i
suppose
could
argue
that
at
that
point
that
we're
no
longer
challenging
the
remand,
the
remand
has
happened
and
been
completed
and
the
trial
has
taken
place;
we're
now
simply
challenging
the
results.
and
maybe
that
clever
lawyer
would
win
the
day.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
oh,
i
think
in
state
court
a
clever
litigant
could
argue
all
these
points
over
again,
because
1447(d)--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--this
court
would
ultimately
decide
it
and
they
would
ultimately
decide
questions
such
as
whether
the
jury
or,
to
put
it
the
other,
the
bench
trial
issue
has
been
preserved.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
well,
congress
has
said...
congress
has
said
the
contrary.
and
there
are
often
important
differences
between
state
and
federal
courts.
justice
breyer,
i
think
you
have
some
experience
in
california.
we
have
9
to
3
jury
verdicts.
you
will
have
a
litigant
here
next
year
saying
that
the
difference
between
a
removal
and
a
remand
is
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
or
a
9
to
3
jury
verdict,
and
that's
really
important.
now,
i
would
just
briefly
like
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
a
jury
because
i
don't
think
she
got
the
full
answer.
let
me
give
it
to
you,
justice
ginsburg.
the
jury
issue
is
virtually...
i
would
say
not
virtually.
the
jury
issue
is
out
of
this
case
based
on
my
adversary's
reply
brief.
i
will
tell
you
why.
we
did
ask
for
a
jury
trial
in
our
case
and
we
were
upset
about
the
whole
notion
of
this
case
being
removed
on
a
cross-claim
we
were
not
involved
in...
we
never
sued
powerex...
losing
our
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
this
important
case.
mr.
frederick's
reply
brief
says
at
footnote
4,
page
3...
or
footnote
3,
page
4;
i
apologize...
that
our
right
to
jury
trial
is
not
threatened
here
and
that
under
certain
lower
court
decisions,
which
he
is
correct
they
do
exist...
i'm
not
sure
they're
unanimous...
our
right
to
jury
trial
would
survive
even
though
he
would
have
a
right
to
a
bench
trial
under
his
theory.
well,
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
cross
claim
against
mr.
frederick's
client.
the
cross
claim
in
the
california
court,
which
got
this
whole
ball
of
wax
rolling,
is
a
cross
claim
for
equitable
indemnification
and
declaratory
relief,
equitable
claims
as
to
which
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
so
i
think
we
are
all
now
in
agreement
on
a
jury
trial.
we
are
arguing
someone
else's
case.
some
day
a
litigant
will
appear
in
this
court
and
present
the
issue
of
jury
trial--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--there
is,
and
that's
the
issue
that
i
think
congress
has
clearly
and
definitively
said,
the
state
courts
have
pretty
good
judges,
pretty
good
juries,
pretty
good
systems
and
certiorari
procedures
to
this
court.
in
kircher,
the
court's
opinion
says,
"the
state
courts
are
perfectly
competent
to
resolve
these
issues.
"
the
cost
of
this
case
being
frozen
for
3
or
4
years
while
we
debated
these
issues...
and
these
issues
are
very
difficult.
i
would
say,
we
don't
only
have
a
backup
position,
we
have
a
backup
backup
position.
because
we
think,
number
one,
the
court
should
be
taken
at
its
word.
we
think,
number
two,
the
court
had
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
removing
jurisdiction
is
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
if
you
look
at
the
book,
chapter
89,
section
1441,
et
cetera,
it's
titled
removal
of
cases
from
state
courts.
you
won't
find
the
word
"subject
matter
jurisdiction"
in
there
anywhere.
a
removal
petition
removes
a
case
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court,
where
if
it's
a
foreign
sovereign
immunities
case,
the
federal
court
decides
if
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
what
1330
says
in
haec
verba.
it's
what
this
court's
decision
in
verlinden
versus
central
bank
of
nigeria
says
in
haec
verba.
verlinden
says
every
court
that
gets
a
foreign
sovereign
immunities
case
must
determine
at
the
outset
whether
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
by
determining
if
the
foreign
sovereign
is
immune.
which
means
that
judge
whaley
was
correct
when
he
decided
that
by
concluding
he
had
an
immune
party
in
front
of
him,
he
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
it
was
equally
correct
for
bonneville,
when
he
determined
that
united
states
versus
myers
says
the
same
thing,
so
that
he
had
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
in
addition,
there
was
a
derivative
jurisdiction
doctrine.
this
notion
of
"removal
jurisdiction"
quote
unquote,
it's
a
term
we
all
use.
the
court
used
it
in
kircher.
i
use
it.
other
people
use
it.
but
if
you
start
getting
serious
about
your
words,
it's
meaningless
in
this
context.
we
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
it
is
conferred
in
the
area
of
1330,
1331,
1332.
it
is
not
conferred
in
1441,
1442,
or
1443.
it's
simply
not
there.
so
my
backup
argument
is,
he
was
right
on
every
point.
and
my
backup
argument
beyond
that
is
again,
please,
reread
carnegie
mellon.
put
it
next
to
thermtron
and
look
at
what
the
lower
courts
have
done.
they
have
found
excuse
after
excuse
to
take
appeals
in
cases
that
have
no
business
being
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
they
don't
have
immunity
issues.
they
don't
have
foreign
sovereign
issues.
they
don't
have
anything.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
no,
your
honor.
i
overstated.
let
me
say
it
more
clearly.
kircher,
decided
last
term,
makes
clear
the
line
between
what
can
and
can't
be
done.
it
discusses
precisely
this
point
and
it
refers
to
the
ryan
versus
contra
case
and
it
refers
to
the
principi
case.
and
it
says
that
when
the
court
is
patently
wrong
about
whether
the
issue
it
is
discussing
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
then
this
court
may
enter
into--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--that
would
be
my
first
answer,
and
the
chief
justice
said
it
much
better
than
mine,
than
i
have.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
looking
at
kircher,
to
be
fair,
looking
at
kircher,
i
believe
that
is
the
position
justice
scalia
took,
it
is
concurring
opinion.
and
i
didn't
want
to
suggest
that
justice
scalia's
concurring
opinion
was
the
opinion
of
the
court.
the
opinion
of
the
court
wrestles
with
what
i
thought
was
justice
alito's
question.
what
do
you
do
if
the
trial
judge
says
he
has
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
he
has
not
simply
made
a
garden
variety
jurisdictional
error
but
he
has
missed
what
the
issue
is?
it's
really
failure
to
state
a
claim.
it's
really
something
else.
and
we
of
course
have
the
steele
case
which
says
jurisdiction
has
many
meanings
and
we
often
get
confused
about
them.
and
the
court
answered
the
question
by
saying,
only
when
the
trial
court
is
patently
wrong,
patently
wrong
not
about
the
jurisdictional
question
but
as
to
whether
it
is
even
a
jurisdictional
question,
only
when
the
court
is
patently
wrong
do
we
second
guess
the
court.
so--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--if
the
court
wants
to
adopt
justice
scalia's
view
in
the
prior
case,
in
the
kircher
case,
my
clients
would
be
pleased
with
the
results--
mr.
leonard
b.
simon
--but
i
think,
justice
roberts...
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice...
i
apologize.
because
my
time
is
running
short,
i
would
say
the
key
point
in
this
case
came
when
we
sought
to
have
a
prompt
dismissal
in
the
ninth
circuit
of
the
appeal
prior
to
full
briefing
and
argument,
and
it
was
denied.
that
was
the
point
at
which
if
a
litigant
simply
parroted
the
phrase
"this
is
patently
wrong",
would
likely
in
most
circuits
before
most
panels
have
lost.
and
this
matter
would
have
gone
back
to
the
state
court
2-1/2
years
before
it
got
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
five
years
before
today.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
think
i've
completed
my
comments.
