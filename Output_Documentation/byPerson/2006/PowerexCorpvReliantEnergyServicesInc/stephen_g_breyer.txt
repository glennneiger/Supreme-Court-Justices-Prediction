justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
it
goes
back
to
the
state
court
and
you
litigate
it,
you
lost,
can
you
raise
as
a
point
of
appeal
that
you
did
not
receive
two
things
the
statute
guaranteed
you?
one
was
a
determination
in
the
federal
court
that
you're
an
organ
of
a
federal
state,
and
second,
a
bench
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
could
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
asking
could
you,
yes
or
no.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
okay.
now
if
you
lost
in
the
state
court,
could
you
then
use
that
as
a
basis
for
asking
this
court
to
accept
jurisdiction?
and
if
they...
if
we
did,
we
took
it
and
we
heard
the
case,
reverse,
and
send
it
back
for
the
proper
tribal
under
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
whenever
there's
an
erroneous
remand,
the
practical
problems
that
you
raise
are
present.
and
they're
awful.
i
don't
deny
them.
i
mean,
they're
right
there
in
the
statute,
it
foresees
them.
so
i
wonder,
is
there
any
difference
in
this
case
from
every
case
where
the
remand
is
erroneous?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
terms
of
the
legal
right
to
get
the
trial
to
which
the
law
entitles
you
on
your
view
of
the
law,
there
is
no
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
would
get
those
eventually,
it
would
just
have
to
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
technical
question.
the
same
one.
i
would
to
be...
imagine
it
is
a
diversity
case.
imagine
that
a
federal
court
erroneously
remands
it.
a
trial
gets
up
to
this
court.
and
we
say
it
was
diverse.
it
shouldn't
have
been
remanded.
now
what's...
is
that
like...
can
that
happen?
i
guess.
and
is
the
remedy
then
wipe
out
the
state
proceedings,
go
back
to
federal
court?
what
happens?
has
that
have
ever
been
a
case
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
is
called,
the
case,
missouri--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what,
what
reason
would
congress
have
for
wanting
a
system
that
says...
and
there
are
many,
many,
many
people
in
the
united
states
who
would
like
to
sue
pakistan.
they
would
like
to
sue
china.
they
would
like
to
sue
russia.
there
are
all
kinds
of
places
they
would
like
to
sue.
and
why
would
congress
want
to
have
a
system
that
says
to
those
countries,
you
can
come
into
federal
court
and
get
your
claim
adjudicated,
whether
it
is
really
you,
china
a;
but
by
the
way,
if
the
federal
judge
makes
a
mistake,
there
you
are
in
mississippi,
alabama,
illinois,
any
one
of
50
different
states?
in
front
of
juries,
the
very
thing
that
we
gave
you
this
statute
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
do.
now
what
would
their
theory
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
were
saying
they
were
an
organ
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
and
therefore
they
are
immune
unless...
unless
they
fall
within
an
exception.
and
it
may
be
they
do.
is
that
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
saying,
that's
how
the
statute
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
take
it
if
you
win
this,
it's
precisely
the
same,
in
respect
to
a
person
who
has
total
immunity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
judge
makes
a
big
mistake--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--china
comes
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
says
of
course
you're
china.
and
then
it
signs
a
remand
order.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
well,
after
all...
if
you're
going
to
say,
you
say
that
one
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
or
not,
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
and
now
all
they
want
here
is
the
organ
issue
reviewed
on
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
difference
between
the
one
and
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
why
is
it
in
your
opinion
that
the
immunity
thing
is
so
important
that
they
get
this
collateral
appeal,
but
the
organ
thing
is
not
so
important
since
all,
what
turns
on
that
is
whether
they're
going
to
have
their
non-jury
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
this
very
old
judge
like
me.
china
is
there.
and
he
says:
this
isn't
china;
formosa
is
china.
so
he
says
remand.
so
there
we
are,
china
is
now
in
the
western
district
state
court
for
illinois
and
they're
suing
them
for
a
lot
of
money.
now,
you
said,
i
thought,
before
that
where
that
happened,
and
they
wrongly
denied
immunity,
they
could,
china,
appeal
in
the
federal
system.
i
thought
you
said
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
they
want
is
a
definitive
appeal
that
this
is
really
china,
all
right.
now,
can
they
do
that,
yes
or
no?
you
said
yes.
so
i
thought
justice
kennedy's
question
was,
if
they
can
do
that,
why
can't
powerex
appeal
in
exactly
the
same
way
on
the
question
of
whether
they're
an
organ.
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
care.
i
don't
call
this
an
appeal
of
a
remand.
what
this
is,
it
is
an
appeal
of
the
determination
precedent
to
remand
that
powerex
is
not
an
organ.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
make
them
just
as
happy,
i
believe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
say,
depending
on
the
clever
lawyers,
or
non-clever
as
the
case
may
be,
why
not
just
say
congress
intended
that
you
do
get
an
underlying
appeal
in
the
federal
system,
for
what
is
at
stake
is
not
simply
where
the
case
will
be
tried,
but
rather
significant
and
important
rights
attach
in
the
federal
court
that
do
not
attach
in
the
state
court.
and
therefore,
it
is
like,
the
appeal
you
get
when
they...
when
what
is
at
stake
is
immune
or
not,
and
by
doing
that
we
avoid
four
more
years
of
litigation
and
the
necessity
to
hire
clever
lawyers.
