probably
the
reason
they
do
this
is
that
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
claims
by
prisoners
in
federal
courts
that
are
hard
to
decipher.
they
don't
know
what
it's
about.
they
don't
want
to
put
the
defendant
to
the
burden
of
coming
in
in
every
single
complaint
when
it's
quite
a
good
probability
it's
about
nothing.
that's
the
kind
of
reasoning
that
would
lead
to
a
rule
like
this.
so...
and
then
you
have
the
statute
and
the
statute
says
indeed
there's
a
special
power
here
to
dismiss
if
it's
frivolous
or
it
doesn't
state
a
claim
or
malicious.
so
why
isn't
this
just
an
exercise
of
the
sixth
circuit's
or
a
court's
ordinary
subsidiary
rulemaking
powers?
they're
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
manage
their
docket.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
point
would
be
that
they
can
do
this
if
we
amend
the
federal
rules.
if
it's
a
problem
take
it
to
the
rules
committee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
it
hurt
if
you
dismiss
the
whole
thing?
they
could
just
refile.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
would
happen
is
you
just
dismiss
the
complaint.
so...
i
guess
again
the
reason
they
have
these
things
is
they
get
a
certain
number
of
complaints,
they
have
no
idea
what
it
sys,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
they
don't
know
what
the
claim
is,
they
don't
understand
it,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
written
here;
the
person
wasn't
represented;
it's
hard
to
make
out.
and
for,
the
judge
thinks
i
have
to
go
through
all
these
papers;
i
have
to
figure
out
if
there
is
something
here
that
was
exhausted,
we
know
something
happened;
it
was
something
exhausted...
so
the
simplest
thing
is
just
dismiss
it.
now
the
prisoner
can
always
refile
it
with
the
parts
that
he
has
to
now
figure
out
were
exhausted.
now
is...
and
it
doesn't
hurt
because,
just
refile
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
true?
or
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
well,
the
reason
it
would
hurt
is
because
it's
difficult
for
the
judge
to
go
though
this
complaint
that
he
can't
quite
make
sense
out
of.
and
it
puts
the
burden
of
the
prisoner
to
go
through
and
figure
out
what
he
really
wants
to
say.
that's
why...
that's
why
it's
easier
for
the
judge
just
to
dismiss
it
than
to
go
through
many,
what
could
be
many
pages
with
a
fine-toothed
comb
trying
to
figure
out
if
there
is
anything
here
that
was
exhausted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically,
i
mean
you've
heard
the
question
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
that
my
questions
and
certainly
others
were
based
on
certain
empirical
premises
that
might
be
true,
might
not
be
true.
so
why
isn't
this
a
question
for
the
rules
committee?
why
not
go
to
the
rules
committee
if
this
really
is
a
burden
and
so
forth,
rather
than
doing
something
unusual,
which
is
to
make
exhaustion
something
other
than
an
affirmative
defense,
to
dismiss
the
whole
complaint,
which
appear
to
be
rules
that
reached
draconian
results
in
a
few
cases
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
be,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
could
have
run.
so
it
depends.
sometimes
it
is,
sometimes
it
isn't.
but
my
basic
question
here,
isn't
this
a
matter
for
the
rules
committees
rather
than
for
the
sixth
circuit
to
go
off
on
its
own?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
y
is
mr.
gearin.
