mr.
jean-claude
andre
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
these
three
cases,
each
of
the
three
petitioners
filed
administrative
grievances
with
the
michigan
department
of
corrections.
the
michigan
department
of
corrections
conducted
investigations
and
issued
final
decisions
on
the
merits
of
petitioner's
grievances.
nevertheless,
a
year
and
a
half
later,
each
of
the
petitioner's
complaints
was
thrown
out
of
federal
court
without
leave
to
amend
because
petitioners
failed
to
satisfy
on
of
the
sixth
circuit's
judge-made
corollaries
to
the
plra's
exhaustion
requirement.
none
of
those
three
corollaries
find
any
meaningful
support
in
the
federal
rules
of
procedure,
in
fact
they
contradict
the
federal
rules.
nor
do
they
find
any
support
in
administrative
law
or
habeas
law,
the
two
areas
of
law
to
which
this
court
looks
for
guidance
in
interpreting
administrative
litigation
and
format.
finally,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
circuits
that
have
considered
these
questions
have
rejected
them
all.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
heightened
pleading
rule
that
the
sixth
district
applied
here.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
require
a
plaintiff
to
simply
provide
a
short
claim
statement
of
the
basis
on
which
his
or
her
claim
will
lie.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
enumerate
certain
kinds
of
allegations
that
a
plaintiff
must
plead
with
specificity,
those
are
enumerated
in
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
9(c),
but
exhaustion
is
not
one
of
them.
accordingly--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
think
that
would
be
correct,
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
court's
habeas
jurisprudence.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
first
of
all,
when
congress
created
the
various
screening
provisions
in
the
plra,
it
noticeably
omitted
exhaustion.
it
clearly
had
exhaustion
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
plra.
the
term
42
u.s.c.
1997--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
what
sets
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
apart
from
i
think
the
hypothetical
you
propose,
and
also
from
this
court's
habeas
jurisprudence
is
that
in
both
of
those
scenarios
the
plaintiff,
the
prisoner,
is
given
a
chance
to
respond.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
if
they
don't
they
don't
satisfy
the
heightened
pleading
rule
at
the
minute
that
they
file
their
initial
complaint,
they
are
out.
there
is
no
leave
to
amend,
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
petitioner
jones'
case,
he
filed
the
complaint
and
he
actually
did
allege
that
he
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
he
said:
i
exhausted
my
administrative
remedies,
i
filed
my
step
one
grievance
on
this
date,
i
received
a
denial
on
that
date,
and
he
went
down
the
list
through
all
three
steps.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
with
respect
to
the
form,
i
don't
think
that
the
form
is
improper,
but
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
a
court
to
dismiss
the
prisoner's
case
if
the
prisoner
failed
to
fill
out
the
section
of
the
form
that
asks
him
about
exhaustion
because
exhaustion
is
an
affirmative
defense
in
both
administrative
law
and
habeas,
and
there's
no
indication
in
this
statute
that
congress--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
think
the
district
court
can
ask
the
plaintiff
pretty
much
whatever
the
district
court
likes.
but
whether
the
district
court
could,
could
dismiss
a
case
for
failure
to
comply,
failure
to
respond
to
that
question,
that's
another
matter.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
absolutely.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
would
certainly
concede
that
if
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
a
prisoner
has
not
exhausted
his
or
her
administrative
remedies
then
that
claim
can
be
dismissed.
i
guess
the
way
it
would
operate...
and
i
haven't
seen
a
case
like
this...
but
it
would
be
where
a
prisoner
says,
i
didn't
exhaust
my
administrative
remedies
and
i
have
no
excuse
for
failing
to
do
so,
but
please,
district
court,
please
take
mercy
on
me.
and
in
that
situation
the
district
court
could
say,
there's
absolutely
no
way
you
can
possibly
prevail
on
the
merits,
so
your
claim--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--the
problem
is
that
it
conflicts
with
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
rule
8.
and
as
this
court
this
repeatedly
said,
including
as
recently
as
last
term
in
hill
v.
mcdonough,
the
court
will
not
impose
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
absent
an
amendment
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct,
but
if
it--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--right.
or
if
the
court
were
to
add
plra
exhaustion
to
the
rule
9(c).
mr.
jean-claude
andre
it
may
be
a
reasonable
means,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
permissible,
because
congress
had
exhaustion
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
plra
and
noticeably
absent
from
all
the
plra
screening
provisions
is
the
term
"exhaustion".
mr.
jean-claude
andre
right,
i
think
i
understand.
i
think
it
goes
back
still
to
the
fact
that
there's
not
a
clear
congressional
expression
to
take
these
cases
out
of
the
federal
rules.
in
califano
v.
yamasaki
we
believe
is
instructive
on
that
point.
in
in
that
case
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
had
argued
that
section
205(g)
of
the
social
security
act,
which
used
the
term
23.
this
court
said:
no,
we
cannot
read
the
word
"individual"
as
such
a
clear
expression.
it
may
have
been
congress's
policy
to
have
individual
claims
be
addressed
one
by
one,
but
you
have
to
find
that
clear
expression
in
the
statute
and
that
clear
expression
is
not
here.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito.
we
have
exhaustively
researched
that
language,
the
reasonable
opportunity
to
prevail
on
the
merits
1997(g),
and
the
only
courts
that
construe
that
language
are
courts
construing
1997(e)
and
(g),
and
they
have
universally
found
that
that
provision
simply
summarizes
the
other
screening
provisions'
terms,
so,
frivolous,
malicious,
fails
to
state
a
claim,
or
seeks...
from
an
immune
defendant.
and
we
can't
really
think
of
what,
what
else
congress
would
have
had
in
mind
because
while
it's
like
the
preliminary
injunction
standard
it
makes
no
sense
that
congress
wanted
a
prisoner
to
satisfy
a
preliminary
injunction
standard
before
requiring
prison
officials
to
respond.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
think
if
the
circuit
were
to,
sixth
circuit
were
to
allow
amendment
it
would
certainly
mitigate
the
situation.
it's
our
position
that
the
screening
provisions
can't
overrule
federal
rule
of
procedure
15
either,
but
the
problem
we
see
with
even
doing
away
with
the
no
amendment
rule,
but
keeping
in
place
the
heightened
pleading
rule,
is
that
we
are
talking
about
prisoners.
prisoners
who
don't
have
a
lot
of
access
to
materials.
they
may
have...
legal
materials.
they
may
have
great
difficulty
holding
on
to
their,
their
formally
filed
grievances.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
yes.
that
was
in
petitioner
jones's
case,
and
that...
petitioner
jones's
case
is
a
great
example
of
how
the
heightened
pleading
rule
and
the
no
amendment
rule
work
together
to
result
in
a
prisoner
being
unable
to
cure
any
problem
with
his
or
her
initial
complaint.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
i...
we
concede
that
an
action
that
contains
unexhausted
claims
or
a
mixed
action
shouldn't
have
been
brought
in
the
first
place,
but
it's
there.
and
the
question
then
becomes
what
to
do
about
it.
and
the
language
no
action
shall
be
brought;
it's
very
common
in
administrative
exhaustion
schemes,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
uses
almost
identical
language,
the
immigration
nationality
act
uses
very
similar
language,
title
vii--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
guess
i
should
be
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
are
by
no
means
advocating
that
a
prisoner
can
shoe
horn
in
unexhausted
claims
with
exhausted
claims.
so
the
unexhausted
claims
must
go.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
it's
been
our
experience
and
from
reading
the
case
law
it
appears
that
prisoners
don't
intentionally
try
to
shoe
horn
in
unexhausted
claims
with
their
exhausted
claims.
it's
typically
based
on
innocent
mistake,
a
simple
failure
to
understand
either
the
particular
circuit
within
which
they
are
housed,
a
difficulty
in
understanding
that
circuit's
exhaustion
law,
difficulty
in
understanding
the
prison
grievance
procedures
that
they
attempted
to
comply
with,
and
perhaps
even
being
further
confused
by
the
fact
that
prison
grievance
administrators
seem
to
apply
prison
grievance
regulations,
i
don't
want
to
say
in
an
ad
hoc
manner,
but
inconsistently.
and
so
when
they
bring
these
complaints
that
are
mixed
they
actually
are
intending
to
bring
a
fully
exhausted
complaint
but
then
after
a
little
built
of
judicial
review,
it
becomes
clear
that
they
didn't
exhaust.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
it
hurts
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
well...
and...
it
hurts
under
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
because
they
did
not
allow
prisoners
to
amend.
so--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--it
doesn't
hurt
if
the--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
i
guess
there
is
two
different
versions
of
the
total
exhaustion
rule
as
it's
termed.
there
is
the
eighth
circuit's
rule
with
is
with
leave
to
amend.
so
the
complaint
is
dismissed,
and
prisoner
can
file
a
new
complaint
without
the
unexhausted
claims.
then
there
is
the
sixth
circuit's
rule,
which
is
the
most
draconian
of
all
the
versions.
and
that
says
the
entire
action
is
dismissed,
prisoner
must
institute
a
new
action.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
it's
draconian
because
by
the
time
the
prisoner
refiles
his
or
her
action
there
could
be
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
the
prisoner
may
not
be
able
to
bring
those
claims
any
more.
in
fact
the
fifth
circuit
in--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--not
in
the
sixth
circuit
anymore,
and
not
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
believe
they
all
do.
if
they
qualify--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--if
they
get
ifp
status,
all
that
means...
well,
first
of
all,
they
only
get
to
do
that
three
times.
or
to
have
three
actions
dismissed
before
they
lose
their
ip
status.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
no,
no,
no.
i
mean...
but
that's
not
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
even
if
they
qualify
for
ifp
status
they
still
have
to
pay
the
$350
filing
fee.
it's
just
taken
out
in
installments.
and
so
for
a
prisoner
who
makes
$2.50
a
day
or
$2.50
a
week
it...
it
is
costly
for
them
to--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
but
i
think
at
least,
at
least
under
that
scenario,
the
district
court
still
only
has
to
take
one
look
at
the
case
and
then
it
can
move
forward,
it
deletes
the
unexhausted
claims.
so
from
a
judicial
efficiency
standpoint
i
think
the
ortiz
v.
mcbride
rule
out
of
the
second
circuit,
which
is
the
rule
that
we
are
advocating,
is...
is
the
cleanest
approach.
it
takes
the
choice
away
from
the
prisoner;
it
puts
the
choice
with
the
district
court,
and
it
allows
the
district
court
to
delete
off
any
unexhausted
claims.
and
in
most
instances--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
think
there
is.
the
circuit...
the
four
circuits
that
we
know
were
unanimous
that
plra
exhaustion
is
not
jurisdictional,
and
in
woodford
we
know
this
court
confirmed
that.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
the
plra
exhaustion
is
an
affirmative
defense,
then
it
would
operate
like
other
exhaustion
schemes
in
administrative...
administrative
law,
and
habeas,
where
it
is
waivable
by
the
other
side.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
unfortunately
more
complicated
than
that.
if
the
first
question
in
the
jones
case,
the
id
pleading
rule
question,
is
resolved
in
favor
of
petitioner
jones,
then
total
exhaustion
is
a
live
issue.
because
the
sixth
circuit
as
an
alternative
holding
justified
the
dismissal
of
jones's
complaint
on
the
total
exhaustion
ground.
and
i
guess
on
the
other
side
if
the
court
were
to
resolve
the
identifying
the
defendant's
issue
against
petitioner--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--the
sixth
circuit...
and
it's
not
really
clear
from
this
opinion,
because
it's
an
unpublished
opinion,
but
the
sixth
circuit
appears
to
have
adopted
the
magistrate
judge's
finding
which
is
based
on
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
that
jones
substantively,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
didn't
exhaust
all
of
his
claims,
so...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
being
clear.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
yes.
but
they
also
argued
that
jones
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
on
everything
but
his
first
amendment
retaliation
claim.
or
what
they
termed
his
negative
work--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
in
order
for
the
total
exhaustion
issue
to
be
moot,
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
would
have
to
be
resolved
against
petitioner
jones,
and
the
naming
the
defendants
issue
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
williams
and
walton.
i
charted
out
on
a
matrix
and
verified
it
a
couple
of
times.
turning
to
the
naming
issue
if
i
could,
since
we
haven't
addressed
that,
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
simply
sets
a
floor
of
how
much
specificity
a
prisoner
must
provide
in
his
or
her
grievance.
it
does
not
require
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
here
which
is
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
statutory
law
a
prisoner
must
have
identified
every
individual
who
he
or
she
later
sues
in
federal
court.
this
is
a
kind
of
endemic,
or
flows
logically
from
the
court's
decision
in
woodford--
v.
ngo.
woodford
v.
ngo
says
that
prisoners
must
comply
with
grievance
procedures.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i
guess
broadly
speaking
no;
in
certain
cases
yes.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
right.
exactly.
if...
in
michigan
they
have
a--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
believe
that's
correct.
i
mean,
although
i
guess--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--no,
right.
i
think
really
the
question
is
an
x
or
not
x
question.
it's
does
the
plra
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
required
individuals
to
be
named
in
the
underlying
grievances,
and
the
plra
is
entirely
silent
on
that
question,
and
this
court's
decision
in
sims
v.
apfel
lends
further
lends
further
support
to
the
proposition
that
a
federal
court
cannot
go
beyond
what
the
particular
administrative
agency's
rules
require.
i
realize
that
was
a
plurality
decision
but
i
think
the
petitioners
win
under
either
the
plurality
opinion
or
under
justice
o'connor's
concurrence.
and
so
yes,
justice
scalia
we
agree
with
you
that
it's
simply
an
x
or
y
question
that
down
the
road
perhaps
the
court
could
address
the
scenario
where
a
prison
system
amends
its
rules
to
require
individual
defendants
to
be
named
and
then
perhaps
a
prisoner
can't
comply
with
that
based
on
the
short
previous
filing
deadlines,
and
then
there
is
a
question
of
whether
the
administrative
remedies
were
actually
ever
available
to
that
particular
prisoner.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
correct.
i
believe
you're
referring
to
either
the
williams
or
the
walker--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--right.
and
to
that
extent
the
prison
grievance
system
worked,
because
the
prisoners
provided
as
much
detail
as
they
possibly
could
and
then
the
prison
grievance
system
went
out,
conducted
its
investigation,
broadened
the
universe
of
relevant
facts,
and
then
made
a
determination.
they
happened
to
determine
that
grievances
were
not
meritorious.
obviously,
petitioners
disagree
with
that
assessment.
that's
why
they
sued
in
federal
court.
but
the
prison
grievance
system
worked.
to
borrow
from
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
spur
v.
gillis,
a
cooperative
ethos
between
inmate
and
jailer
was
achieved,
because
so
long
as
the
prisoner
provides
sufficient
information
for
the
grievance
system
to
go
out
and
answer
any
unresolved
questions
and
so
long
as
the
prison
grievance
system
avails
itself
of
that
opportunity
then
the
claim
is
exhausted.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
earlier
about
who
is
better
equipped
to
plead
and
show
exhaustion.
it's
certainly
our
position
that
the
michigan
department
of
corrections
or
prison
grievance
administrators
are
absolutely
better
equipped
to
do
so.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
the
prisoner
may
know
best
whether
or
not
he
or
she
filed
a
grievance
and
whether
or
not
he
appealed.
the
prisoner
may
not
know
precise
dates
on
which
he
or
she
did
so
or
have
copies
of
the
grievances
anymore.
this
really
kind
of
brings
the
heightened
pleading
rule,
not
just
whether
it's
just
affirmative
defense
or
a
general
pleading
rule,
to
the
fore.
prisoners
are
prisoners.
they
get
moved
around,
they
get
put
in
administrative
segregation;
they
are
subject
to
repeat
searches;
they
have
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
possession
of
their
belongings.
on
the
other
hand
the
michigan
department
of
corrections
keeps
copies
of
all
the
grievances,
denials
and
appeals.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
he
may
be
able
to
aver
generally
but
with
specificity
there
are
many
cases
in
which
he
won't
be
able
to.
but
the
michigan
department
of
corrections'
policy
directive
makes
clear
that
it
has
to
maintain
these
records
for
future
foia
requests,
and
in
many
institutions
it
has
to
track
them
in
a
computer.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
in
the
jones
case,
they
were
quite
able
to
bring
forward
the
proof
of
exhaustion
that
would
satisfy,
that
would
have
satisfied
the
court
that
jones
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
jones
gets,
just
got
thrown
out
of
court,
essentially,
in
a
game
of
"gotcha",
because
he
hadn't
attached
his
complaint
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
most
importantly,
from
a
judicial
efficiency
standpoint,
making
exhaustion
an
affirmative
defense
makes
sense.
that
means
that
the
lawyers
in
the
state
attorney's
general,
in
the
state,
in
the
office
of
the
state's
attorneys
general,
are
going
to
be
able
to
put
forward
the
best
arguments
as
to
why
a
claim
is
or
is
not
exhausted.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
but
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
point
earlier
congress
could
have
included
unexhausted
claims
among
those
types
of
claims
that
the
court
could
screen
out
and
dismiss
or
among
those
claims
for
which
a
court
could--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--or
again,
it
may
be
more
efficient
to
have
them
aver
generally,
but
as
far
as
having
a
prisoner
comply
with
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
we
don't
think
that
that
makes
sense.
we
are
talking,
again
we
are
talking
about
prisoners
here.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
either--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--oh,
not
at
all.
i
mean,
i
can't
see
how,
how
respondents
could
argue
that--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--right,
but
it
wasn't
when
these
claims
were
decided.
and
that's
where
i
think
sims
v.
apfel
comes
into
play.
under
justice
thomas'
plurality
opinion,
the
key
is
looking
at
kind
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
if
it's
informal
and
accusatorial
as
opposed
to
adversarial,
then
a
court
cannot
impose
a
requirement
beyond
that
which
the
agency
itself
required
at
the
time
that
the
claims
were
before
the
agency.
under
justice
o'connor's
concurrence,
she
was
concerned
about
fair
notice,
and
certainly
here
in
these
cases
petitioners
williams
and
walton
didn't
have
fair
notice
that
a
year
and
a
half
later
the
state
of
michigan,
after
going
through
the
entire
grievance
procedure
and
never
relying
on
their
failure
to
be
sufficiently
specific,
can
then
come
into
federal
court
and
say,
aha--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--yes,
they
would,
they
would.
and
again,
there
would
certainly
be
constraints
to
too
rigid
enforcement
of
that
particular
provision.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i'm
not
aware
of
any,
justice
ginsburg.
