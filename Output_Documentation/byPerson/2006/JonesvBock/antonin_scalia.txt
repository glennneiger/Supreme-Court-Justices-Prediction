justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
this
is
probably
not
a
question
for
you,
but
a
question
for
your
friend
on
the
other
side.
you
can
ask,
why
does
it
hurt?
you
can
also
ask
why
does
it
help?
what
good
does
it
do
to
bounce
the
whole
thing
back
when
you're
just
going
to
have
them
filed
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
no
problem,
i
assume,
if
the
state
simply
requires
that
you
name
the
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
extent
possible,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
then
there
would
not
be
exhaustion
unless
he
had
named
the
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
may
not
be,
may
not
be
litigating
about
a
whole
lot
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
miss
olivieri,
you
also
rely
on
the
"no
action
shall
be
brought"
language
to
justify
dismissal
of
the
entire
action,
all
claims,
even
though
only
some
of
them
have
not
been
exhausted.
do
you
have
any,
even
a
single
example
of
the
many
other
instances
where
that
language
is
used
in
the
federal
statutes?
and
there
are
many
of
them.
do
you
know
any
other
case
where
it's
been
interpreted
that
way,
so
that
claims
that
are
perfectly
valid
will
not
be
retained,
but
rather
the
whole
action
will
be
dismissed?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
basis
in
the
habeas
context
for
dismissing
the
entire
habeas
application
despite
the
fact
that
some
of
the
claims
have
been
exhausted?
is
there
any
statutory
basis
for
that
or
is
it
just,
just
judicial
efficiency?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
answer
was
it
shouldn't,
i
think.
i
think
she's
making
your
argument
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
she
is
saying
that
we
should
treat
this
area
the
same
way
we
treat
habeas,
so
that
the
whole
case
should
be
dismissed
rather
than
just
the
individual
claims,
which
is
what
i
think
you
want;
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
don't
fight
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
arguments
apply
in
habeas,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
you
had
your
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
making
an
argument
that
it
would
preclude
that
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
we've
got
to
go
back
and
to
the
extent
that
we
can
do
anything
about
it,
we'd
better
toughen
up
habeas
so
that
these
things
get
thrown
out
more
readily.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
sometimes
it's
impossible
to
complete
the
exhaustion.
i
assume
in
some
cases
that
the
time
limit
for
the
last
appeal
will
have
expired,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
requires,
it
requires
response
in
all
the
cases,
and
as
this
subsection
g
indicates,
part
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
eliminate
the
necessity
of
responding
to
frivolous
complaints.
why...
why,
you
know,
you
have
to
go
through
the
requesting
a
response
from
the
government,
when
in
fact
there
is
nothing
to
this
complaint
because
there
has
never
been
any
exhaustion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument.
but
i
mean,
don't
tell
me
that
it
isn't
more
efficient
to
have
the
prisoner
say
at
the
outset
whether
it's
exhausted
or
not.
it
certainly
is.
