ms.

m.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
to
deal
with
the
flood
of
prisoner
litigation
that
was
coming
into
the
federal
courts,
obscuring
the
treatment
for
meritorious
claims
brought
by
all
litigants.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
unburden
the
courts
from
dealing
with
this
flood
of
litigation
that
largely
was
without
merit.
the
purposes
for
the
act
were
to
increase
the
quality
of
the
litigation,
decrease
the
quantity
of
the
litigation,
allow
the
states
to
address
first
the
issues
that
the
prisoners
have
problems
with
and
to
develop
an
administrative
record
to
facilitate
judicial
screening.
and
all
of
this
would
result
in
increased
judicial
resources
for
all
litigation
that
has
potential
merit.
the
invigorated
exhaustion
requirement
does
require
total
exhaustion.
the
statute,
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
confirm
this.
the
statute
states:
"no
action
shall
be
brought
until--
"
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--i've
never
seen
a
transcript.
typically
it's
one
sheet
of
paper.
the
inmate
states
what
the
problem
is,
states
what
he
did
to
try
to
resolve
the
problem
before
filing
a
grievance.
and
then
there's
space
at
the
bottom
for
response.
frequently
the
response
is
right
on
that
page.
sometimes
the
response
indicates
"see
attached".
if
there's
a
lengthier
response
there
may
be
a
separate
page.
similarly,
if
the
prisoner
can't
put
all
of
his--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--for
the
most
part
they
attempt
to
address
the
issue.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
typically
they
are--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--in
the
last
12
months
there
have
been
13,000
grievances
processed
by
the
michigan
department
of
corrections
at
the
third
step,
and
that's
for
people
who
appeal
all
the
way
through
to
the
third
step.
so
there
are
many
more
than
that
before
that.
some
of
the
responses
can
be
very
detailed.
they
can
go
on
for
a
full
page
typewritten
single
spaced.
some
of
the
responses--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--i
haven't
read
all
13,000,
but
typically
the
response
would
be
about
a
half
a
dozen
lines.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
last...
in
the
last
year
that
ended
june
30th,
12
months,
we
had
approximately
200
cases.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
correct.
in
the
previous
years
we
had
somewhat
fewer,
so
it's
sort
of
going
up.
but
you
know,
it's
between
160,
180,
200.
this
year
we're
on
that
same
pace,
approximately
200.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
these
200
are
ones
that
we
were
served
with.
that
doesn't
include
the
ones
that
may
have
been
screened
out
by
the
courts
and
we
were
never
served
with
them.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
this
only
includes
ones
where
a
defendant
was
actually
served
with
process.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
when
it's
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
it's
improper
to
characterize
it
as
draconian.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
this
court
in
neitzke
versus
williams
took
a
look
at
the
previous
version
of
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
and
that
statute
allowed
sua
sponte
dismissals
for
only
two
reasons,
frivolous
and
malicious
cases.
under
that,
in
that
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
when
it's
a
sua
sponte
review
for
those
two
issues
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
adversary
process
that's
embodied
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
congress,
recognizing
that
even
in
neitzke
the
court
indicated
that
the
federal
courts
were
being
flooded
with
prison
litigation,
much
of
it
meritless,
expanded
the
categories
that
are
now
subject
to
sua
sponte
dismissal,
and
those
include
suing
someone
who
is
immune
from
liability
or
failing
to
state
a
claim.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
it
didn't
specifically
include
failure
to
exhaust.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
congress
dealt
with
that
in
1997e(g),
the
waiver
of
reply
provision,
which
confirmed
what
the
1997e(c)
dismissal
provision
provides.
this
is
all
a
screening
situation
for
the
federal
district
courts,
designed
to
move
these
cases
that
have
been
proven
largely
meritless
quickly
through
the
system
rather
than
bogging
the
courts
down--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--well,
exhaustion
is
the
very
first
provision
and
it's--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--it's
not
specifically
there,
but
the
exhaustion
provision
is
a
precursor.
it's
a
precondition.
you
can't
even
get
into
court
until
you've
exhausted
because
it
says
no
action
shall
be
brought.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
the
courts
have
interpreted
statutes
of
limitations
consistently
to
be
in
the
category
of
an
affirmative
defense.
the
problem
with
that
is
this
statute,
the
plra,
is
the
new
regime
for
prison
litigation,
not
for
all
the
litigation
across
the
board.
and
in
the
waiver
of
reply,
the
congress
specifically
took
the
defendant
out
of
the
equation,
requiring
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
case
has
been
exhausted,
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
state
a
claim
and
the
other
criteria
that
are
all
in
that--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--not
specifically,
but
failure
to
exhaust
could
be
construed
as
a--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--congress
put
the
screening
provision
as
number
one,
where
you
cannot
even
bring
a
case
to
court
unless
you
have
exhausted
administrative
remedies.
so
it's
unimaginable
that
that
would
not
be
a
ground
for
sua
sponte
dismissal
when
you
can't
even
bring
your
case
until
you've
exhausted.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
habeas
corpus
is
another
situation
where
there
is
a
provision
that
says
no
relief
shall
be
granted,
no
writ
shall
be
granted,
absent
exhaustion
of...
exhaustion
of
state
court
remedies.
there
in
the
habeas
situation,
it
is
a
little
bit
different
than
in
the
plra...
pardon
me...
because
there
is
a
stay
in
abeyance
provision
in
habeas--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--which
was
in
the
statute
before
congress
passed
the
plra,
and
congress
actually
took
out
the
stay
in
abeyance
provision.
it
all
serves
the
purpose
that
congress
intended,
which
was
to
allow
the
courts
to
quickly
screen
these
cases.
if
you
look
at
e(a)(c)(1)...
(c)(2),
they
give
the
court
many
options
for
doing
what
is
most
judicially
prudent
in
that
particular
case
to
preserve
resources.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
there
is...
i
believe
it's
under
the
exhaustion
requirement.
the
court
has
the
option
of
dismissing
the
entire
action...
actually,
i
believe
there
the
petitioner
gets
the
option,
do
they
want
to
proceed
on
the
exhausted
claims
or
do
they
want
to
drop
out
the
unexhausted
claims.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
i
think
because
congress
did
revoke
the
stay
in
abeyance
provision
in
the
plra.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
pardon
me?
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
yes,
that
is
my
argument,
yes.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
okay.
i
was
suggesting
that
in
habeas
it
is
the
prisoner's
option
to
say--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--i
don't
want
the
prisoner
to
be
allowed
to
choose
to
lop
off
the
unexhausted
claims,
that
is
true,
or
to
amend,
to
delete
them,
because
then
there
is
absolutely
no
incentive
for
the
prisoner
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
litigation
by
stopping
and
thinking,
being
careful
to
exhaust
all
his
claims,
and
being
careful
to
plead
only
claims
that
are
exhaustive.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
but
in
habeas
you
have
the
stay
and
abeyance
provision
that
was
specifically
removed--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--remove...
well--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--right.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
habeas
does
deal
with
a
person's
liberty
whereas
the
plra
is
simply
dealing
with
people
basically
for
the
most
part
trying
to
get
some
sort
of
relief,
either
injunctive
or
monetary
relief,
that
does
not
deal
with
their
basic
freedom.
so
in
that
respect--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--it
could
be...
i
mean,
it's
obviously
both.
i
mean,
there
are
claims
that
are
partially
exhausted
when
the
inmate
files
the
lawsuit.
he
may
finish
exhausting
and
get
the
relief
that
he's
looking
for
without
ever
pursuing
the
case
in
federal
court.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
that
can
also
be
the
case,
and
under
woodford
versus
ngo,
now
that
they
have
to
do
proper
exhaustion,
there
will
be
more
of
those
cases
where
it
probably,
there
wouldn't
be
anything
left
to
do
after
it's
dismissed
except
for
the
plaintiff
to
be
the
one
to
go
through
the
maybe
20
claimed
complaints
and
call
out
the
claims
that
are
not
exhausted,
rather
than
putting
that
burden
on
the
court,
which
is
contrary
to
congress's
purpose,
to
streamline
this
system.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
medical
care
is...
well,
for
one
thing,
prisoners
do
have
counselors,
and
so
if
they're
not
sure
who
is
responsible
for
something,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
they're
supposed
to
do
is
talk
to
their
counselor
to
find
out.
you
know,
i'm
having
this
problem,
i'm
not
getting
surgery,
why
am
i
not
getting
surgery,
who
do
i
talk
to,
who
do
i
complain
to.
so
that's
one
way
to
resolve
the
problem.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
if
the
prisoner
makes
inquiry
and
just
simply
can't
find
out
who
it
is,
then
he
should
state
that
in
his
grievance
and
indicate
that
somebody
in
the
medical
department
is
denying
me
the
surgery.
you
know,
i
talked
to
dr.
so
and
so,
he's
recommended
that
i
get
it,
somebody
is
saying
no,
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
out
who
that
is.
and
likely
during
the
grievance
process,
he
will
find
out
who
it
is,
because
one
of
the
responses
will
probably
say
that.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
he
has
to
make
a
good
faith
attempt
to
find
out.
and
if
he
really,
you
know,
if
he
says
i've
asked
my
counselor,
he
is
not
able
to
provide
me
with
that
information,
then
he
will
get
a
response
on
the
grievance.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
that
goes
back
to
1997e(g),
the
waiver
of
reply,
where
it
says
that
no
defendant
can
be
made
to
respond
to
the
complaint
unless
the
court
can
certify
that
the
prisoner
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prevail
on
the
merits.
it
talks
about
defendants
there.
also,
you
get
a
case
like
mr.--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--the
sixth
circuit
rule
basically
says
name
or
identify.
and
for
instance,
here
with
respect
to
mr.
jones,
he
didn't
name
the
classification
director.
he
used
the
title.
nobody
had
anything
negative
to
say
about
that.
we
know
you're
talking
about
the
classification
director.
it's
mr.
morrison.
we've
only
got
one,
not
a
problem.
the
sixth
circuit
rule
is
basically
name
or
identify,
so
if
you're
going
to
identify--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--the
sixth
circuit
rule
does
require
that.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
the
sixth
circuit
probably
would
say
that
that
he
would
be
out
of
luck
with
respect
to
y.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
that
rule
probably
in
a
case
like
the
walton
case
here,
where
mr.
walton
had
a
problem
with
his
slot
restriction
and
said,
you
know,
deputy
warden
bobo
put
this
restriction
on
me.
it
goes
through
the
grievance
process
and
they
say
bobo
didn't
put
that
on
you,
gearin
put
it
on
you.
that's
at
step
one.
they
give
that
response.
he
goes
then
into
court
after
exhausting
two
or
three
steps,
still
saying,
you
know,
they're
discriminating
against
me
based
on
race
with
the
slot
restrictions.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
i
think
i
was
probably
giving
too
much
explanation,
but
i
think
from
my
understanding
of
how
this
should
operate,
he
is
all
right
in
that
case
to
sue
mr.
gearin,
who
actually
did
put
the
slot
restriction
on
him,
and
he
had
the
wrong
name
at
step
one.
no
problem.
we
got
the
right
name
at
step
two
or,
excuse
me,
at
the
end
of
step
one.
and
he
pursues
it?
i
think
he's
got
a
good
claim
against
mr.
gearin.
the
sixth
circuit
may
not
think
that's
true.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
i
don't
think
the
sixth
circuit
had
that
type
of
case
in
front
of
them
when
they
issued--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--i'm
saying
there
is
none.
i'm
saying
he's
got
a
good
claim
against
mr.
gearin.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
pardon
me?
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
y?
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
okay.
he
named
x,
and
now--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--y
is
mr.
gearin,
yes.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
so
he's
got
a
claim
against--
y.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
i
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit
on
that,
but
i
don't
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit
in
that
when
he
actually
got
to
court,
he
sued
four
other
people
who
were
never
mentioned
in
any
grievance
by
anybody.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
i'm
agreeing
with
you
that
the
sixth
circuit,
both
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
say
that
that
won't
fly,
and
that
in
fact
it
should
fly.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
jones
properly
exhausted
against
the
doctor
who
actually
denied
the
medical
treatment,
denied
the
surgery.
yes.
but
jones
never
served,
unfortunately,
that
particular
doctor,
dr.
cranstall.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
it
will,
it
will
be
the
same
basic
philosophy
that
i've
been
stating
here.
i
mean,
it's
going
to
be
a
name
or
identify.
tell
us
who
you've
got
a
problem
with.
don't
tell
us
you
have
a
problem
with
one
person
and
then
go
into
court
and
sue
six
other
people
who
may
be
the
people
who
actually
responded
to
the
grievance,
because
mdoc
didn't
know
that
you
had
a
problem
with
this
person.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
it
does
make
a
difference
in
proper
exhaustion.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
michigan
doesn't
say
you
have
to
name
him
at
the
first
step.
it
says
when
you
file
your
grievance,
you
know,
name--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--and
if
they
say
they
can't
find
out,
and
they've
made
reasonable
inquiry,
you
know,
there's
somebody
at
the
top
of
the
chain
of
the
medical,
that's
understandable
that
they
may
not
know,
because
they
may
have
never
seen
dr.
pramstaller.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
not
on
these
three
cases,
no.
it
was
the
previous
policy
which
indicated
that
the
inmate
had
to
be
as
specific,
basically
be
as
specific
as
possible,
something
along
those
lines.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
we
would
process
the
grievance,
absolutely.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
yes.
finally,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
entire
purpose
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
is
to
relieve
the
courts
of
the
burden
and
the
screening
process
that's
set
in
place
by
this
statute
allows
the
court
many
options.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
the,
the
purpose
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
was
to
relieve--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--to
reduce
the
volume
to
provide
more--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--well,
we
do
have
an
interest.
we
respond
to
every
one
of
those
in
three
steps,
and
we
never
end
up
in
litigation
for
the
most
part
so
the
grievance
process
works
totally
outside
of
what
litigation
goes
on.
it
does
resolve
complaints.
but
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
allows
the
court
to
either--
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
--they
are
to,
to
benefit
the
courts
by
taking
resources
that
had
previously
been
spent
on
meritless
cases
and
spending
those
instead
on
cases
with
merit,
to
efficiently
screen
these
cases
so
that
the
courts
are
not
spending
a
lot
of
time
asking
us
for
responses
and
so
forth.
if
it's
a
failure
to
state
a
claim
the
case
can
be
dismissed
right,
there
all
without
prejudice.
there
is
nothing
draconian
here.
they
can
be
rebrought.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
thank
you.
ms.
linda
m.
olivieri
they
would
have
to
file
an
answer
and
motion
to
dismiss
raising
whatever
affirmative
defense
they
want
to
raise,
but
at
least
it
gives
them
a
choice
and
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
frame
this
argument
as
opposed
to
putting
it
on,
putting
that
burden
on
the
court.
moreover
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
respondents'
reading
of
the
screening
provisions,
those
screening
provisions
would
swallow
up
every
single
affirmative
defense
enumerated
in
the
federal
rules,
and
also
those
not
enumerated.
