chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
jones
versus
bock,
and
williams
versus
overton.
mr.
andre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
know
under
the
statue
they
can
dismiss
a
case
because
it's
frivolous,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
regardless
of
the
substance
of
the
claim
on
the
merits,
if
you
know
that
you've
just
ignored
the
exhaustion
requirement
isn't
that
a
frivolous
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
rule
8
and
the
normal
rules
weren't
addressed
to
the
unusual
situation
under
the
plra
where
the
district
court
has
an
affirmative
obligation
screen
on
its
own
before
the
defendant
even
gets
involved.
so
if
in
fact,
just
to
follow
on
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
80
percent
of
the
cases
have
this
exhaustion
problem,
why
isn't
this
a
reasonable
means
of
facilitating
the
screening
obligation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
just
told
me
earlier
that
if
it
was
a
case
in
which
exhaustion
is
required
and
not
done
that
would
be
a
frivolous
claim,
and
the
statute
does
refer
to
frivolous
claims.
so
the
district
court
or
the
sixth
circuit
has
just
said,
we
know
that
in
a
large
number
of
cases
they
are
going
to
be
frivolous
because
they
have
ignored
the
exhaustion
requirement,
and
we
just
want
to
try
to
find
out
which
those
cases
are
to
fulfill
the
screening
obligation,
which
takes
this
out
of
the
normal
rule
8
type
of
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
talk
about
the
lack
of
statutory
direction
on
the
first
two
points
but
there
is
a
very
explicit
statute
on
the
third
question.
it
says
no
action
shall
be
brought
until
administrative
remedies
are
exhausted.
and
yet
you
say
the
action
should
be
allowed
to
be
brought
even
if
there
are
unexhausted
claims
in
the
complaint.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
very
different
statutory
scheme.
this
is
designed
to
address
the
problem
of
an
overwhelming
number
of
frivolous
complaints
that
result
in
the
fact
that
meritorious
complaints
can
be
overlooked.
we've
got
a
haystack
in
a
needle
problem
here.
and
if
you
allow
the
action
to
continue,
that
doesn't
do
anything
to
reduce
the
number
of
filing
of
claims
that
as
you
say
should
not
have
been
brought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
right,
but
you
provide
under
your
approach
no
incentive
for
the
prisoner
to
leave
those
claims
out.
instead
what,
a
screening
function
turns
into
an
editing
function.
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
just
excise
out
the
unexhausted
ones
but
allow
the
exhausted
ones
to
continue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
prisoners
pay
the
filing
fee
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
not
entitled
to
ifp
status?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
draconian
rule,
do
you
think?
you
have
to
have
three
actions
dismissed
before
you
have
to
pay
the
filing
fee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
other
incentive
is
if
you
adopt
your
rule,
the
incentive
on
the
prisoner
is
to
put
in
every
possible
claim,
even
if
it
is
not
exhausted
because
maybe
it
will
get
through,
maybe
it
won't.
and
if
it
doesn't
get
through,
no
harm.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
pay
another
$50.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
andre.
ms.
olivieri.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
reason
to
require
total
exhaustion
is
because,
i
would
assume
the
prisoner
may
get
sufficient
relief
if
the
claims
are
exhausted,
that
he
doesn't
feel
the
need
to
go
forward
with
litigation.
but
i
guess
that's
only
true
if
the
exhausted
claims
are
still
alive,
and
how
many,
when
we're
talking
about
unexhausted
claims,
are
those
typically
claims
that
are
not
going
to
be
available
or
are
they
claims
that
may
generate
relief
once
there
is
exhaustion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you've
mentioned
in
your
brief
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
michigan
grievance
policy
with
respect
to
naming
individuals.
what
is
the
consequence
of
that
change
for
our
ability
to
address
that
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
one
of
the
objections
to
the
sixth
circuit
rule
from
your
friend
was
that
this
requirement
of
naming
the
individuals
came
out
of
thin
air.
and
now
we
have
that
requirement
articulated
in
the
grievance
policy.
does
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
the
sixth
circuit
have
the
current
michigan
policy
before
them
when
they
made
their
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
andre,
you
have
five
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that?
the
prisoner
is
the
one
who
presumably
knows
best
whether
or
not
he
filed
a
grievance
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
stretch
to
say
that
the
prison,
which
has
how
many
prisoners
under
their
jurisdiction,
is
in
a
better
position
to
know
in
individual
cases,
an
individual
prisoner,
what
this
prisoner
did
or
didn't
do
with
respect
to
the
grievance
process.
surely
the
prisoner
is
in
the
best
position.
he
knows
what
he
did
or
at
least
what
he
is
going
to
allege.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect,
with
respect
to
the
naming
of
the
individuals,
is
that
claim
moot
because
of
the
change
in
the
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
main
argument
before
was
they
invented
this
requirement
without
any
basis,
but
now
it's
an
actual
requirement
in
the
grievance
procedure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
future
prisoners
now
do
have
fair
notice
because
the
grievance
procedure
says
name
the
individuals,
dates,
names,
places,
names
of
all
those
all
involved.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
in
case
number
05-7058,
jones
v.
bock
and
the
consolidating
case
is
05-7142
williams
v.
overton
and
05-9222
walton
v.
bouchard.
these
cases
were
brought
by
three
prisoners
confined
in
the
michigan
state
prison
system.
each
file
a
grievance
complaining
about
some
aspects
of
prison
conditions
or
their
treatment
in
prison
and
after
these
grievances
were
denied,
prisoners
filed
suit
under
the
federal
civil
right
statute,
title
42
section
1983,
raising
the
same
claims.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that
last
year
nearly
10%
of
all
suits
filed
in
federal
court
were
suits
by
prisoners
complaining
about
prison
condition.
in
1995,
congress
passed
a
law
to
try
to
reduce
the
numbers
of
such
prison
suits
called
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
or
the
plra.
there
were
two
key
components
to
that
act.
first,
before
prisoners
could
file
suit,
they
have
to
exhaust
available
prison
grievance
procedures.
second,
federal
district
judges
were
given
authority
to
screen
prisoner
suits
even
before
an
answer
was
filed
by
state
authorities
and
dismiss
those
that
were
frivolous,
malicious
or
failed
to
stay
the
claim.
in
the
cases
before
us,
the
sixth
circuit
applied
three
procedural
rules
that
it
and
some
other
federal
courts
of
appeal
have
adopted
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
plra.
these
rules
require
a
prisoner
to
demonstrate
in
his
complaint
that
he
has
exhausted
available
grievance
procedures
permit
suit
only
against
the
defendants
who
were
named
by
the
prisoner
in
his
grievance
and
require
courts
to
dismiss
the
prisoner’s
law
suit,
if
he
fails
to
satisfy
the
exhausting
requirement
as
to
any
single
claim
in
his
complaint.
the
sixth
circuit
dismissed
the
prisoners
law
suit
in
the
case
is
before
us
for
failing
to
comply
with
these
rules,
other
circuits
have
declined
to
apply
such
rules
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
first,
the
sixth
circuit
rule
that
prisoners
must
plead
and
show
exhaustion
in
their
complaints,
now
the
usual
rule
is
that
exhaustion
is
an
affirmative
defense.
defendants
have
the
obligation
to
raise
failure
to
exhaust
if
they
seek
to
argue
that
and
plaintiffs
don’t
have
to
show
exhaustion
when
they
file
a
complaint
to
start
a
law
suit.
the
sixth
circuit
reasoned
that
because
the
plra
requires
exhaustion
and
provides
for
judicial
screening
prior
to
a
defendant’s
answer
the
act
would
be
more
effective
in
reducing
prisoner’s
suits
if
prisoners
were
required
to
show
exhaustion
in
their
complaints
prior
to
the
screening.
maybe
so
but
the
plra
is
silent
on
whether
exhaustion
should
be
pleaded
in
the
complaint
or
raised
as
a
defense,
and
therefore
we
think
court
should
follow
the
usual
procedural
rule.
as
noted
that
rule
is
that
exhaustion
is
an
affirmative
defense.
the
sixth
circuit
should
not
have
deviated
from
the
usual
practice
due
to
perceive
policy
concerns
when
there
was
no
basis
for
doing
so
in
the
statute.
the
sixth
circuit
also
imposed
the
rule
requiring
the
prisoners
name
in
the
one
step
of
the
prison
grievance
process,
any
individual
later
named
as
a
defendant
in
the
federal
law
suit,
otherwise
the
suit
would
be
thrown
out
on
the
ground
that
the
prisoner
did
not
satisfy
the
exhaustion
requirement.
here
again
there
is
no
basis
in
the
plra
for
this
requirement
that
act
simply
requires
prisoners
to
exhaust
“such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available”
and
the
prisons
grievance
policy
in
place
of
the
time
petitioners
filed
their
grievances
in
this
case
and
these
cases
makes
no
mention
of
identifying
particular
individual
in
the
grievance.
it
is
the
prison
grievance
requirement
that
must
be
exhausted
and
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
to
impose
an
additional
requirement
not
spelled
out
in
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
the
final
procedural
rule
imposed
by
the
sixth
circuit
requires
courts
to
dismiss
an
entire
complaint
if
any
one
claim
in
the
complaint
is
unexhausted.
now
here
the
sixth
circuit
can
point
to
language
in
the
plra,
the
act
provides
that
“no
action
shall
be
brought”
if
administrative
remedies
have
not
been
exhausted
but
this
language
referring
to
an
action
rather
than
a
particular
claim
is
boilerplate.
courts
do
not
typically
dismiss
entire
complaints
if
a
single
discrete
claim
is
flout
for
example
if
one
claim
is
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
and
another
is
not,
only
the
bad
claim
will
be
dismissed
even
though
such
statute
typically
say
“no
action
shall
be
brought”
just
like
statute
edition
here.
we
see
no
reason
for
a
different
result
under
the
plra.
we
fully
appreciate
the
challenges
faced
by
federal
court
around
the
country
and
trying
to
deal
with
the
flood
of
prisoner
complaints.
the
job
of
the
judge
however
remains
that
of
construing
the
statue
not
making
it
better
by
yielding
to
the
temptations
of
policy
making.
the
new
rules
adopted
by
the
court
below
cannot
be
found
in
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
and
should
not
have
been
imposed.
we
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
