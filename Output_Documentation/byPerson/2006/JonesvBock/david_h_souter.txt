justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
amended
the
rules
that
way,
in
effect
it
would
no
longer
be
an
affirmative
defense.
i
mean,
by
definition
an
affirmative
defense
gets
raised
by
the
defendant
and
so
on,
so
if
we
amended
the
federal
rules
in
practical
terms
it
would
be
like
adding
an
element
to
the
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
your
answer
be
different
if
amendment
were
allowed?
i
mean
isn't
the
problem
in
substance
here,
and
i
don't
mean
to
dismiss
your
arguments
from
the
rules,
but
leaving
the
argument
from
the
text
of
the
rules
aside,
it
wouldn't
be
a
real
problem
here
in
substance
if
the
circuit
bar
allowed
amendment,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
that
the
sixth
circuit
rule
requires
the
identification,
for
complete
exhaustion
requires
the
identification
to
be
made
at
the
first
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
to
make
sure
i
understand
this,
in
a
case,
let's
say
at
stage
one
he
names
dr.
x.
and
for
whatever
reason
in
the
course
of
the
response
perhaps,
he
learned
that
not
only
was
dr.
x
involved
but
dr.
y
was
involved
in
that
decision.
so
if
he
is
denied
relief
at
stage
two,
he
says
x
and
y,
and
he
identifies
x
and
why
all
the
way
through.
he
gets
nothing
satisfactory
to
him,
so
he
goes
in
to
federal
court.
is
it
correct
that
under
the
sixth
circuit
rule
they
would
say
you
have
not
completely
exhausted
because
at
stage
one
you
did
not
mention
y?
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
justification
is
there
for
that?
i
mean,
for
two
stages
through
the
prison
administrative
process,
y
has
been
identified.
the
prison
has
taken
action
on
the
merits
on
the
assumption
that
y
is
in
fact
at
least
an
allegedly
responsible
party.
what
reason
is
there
in
a
federal
court
to
say
that
the
exhaustion
is
incomplete
because
he
didn't
mention
y
back
at
stage
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
that
wasn't
my
hypo.
as
i
understand
it,
in
that
case
he
keeps
going
after
bobo,
period.
and
in
my
case
at
stage
two,
having
learned
something,
he
identifies
y.
and
i...
so
i
don't
see
the
justification,
what
is
the
justification?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
my
case,
you
said
you
understood
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
say
that
although
he
identified
x
and
y
in
stage
two
and
at
stage
three,
and
there
had
been
merit
for
adjudication
at
those
stages,
understanding
who
the
named
respondents
were,
the
sixth
circuit
would
nonetheless
say
you
had
failed
to
exhaust
because
back
at
stage
a
you
mentioned
x
but
not
y.
what
is
the
justification,
if
that
is
still
your
answer,
what
could
the
justification
for
that
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
apparently,
if
i
understand
your
answer,
is
what
the
result
would
be.
and
is
there...
and
i
don't
want
to,
you
know,
make
it
hard
for
you.
i
think
you're
having
a
hard
time
finding
a
justification
for
that
result
and
i
certainly
can't
find
one.
can
you
think
of
any?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
y
in
my
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
he
have
a
good
claim
against
y?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
federal
court
in
my
hypo--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
though
the
sixth
circuit
would
throw
it
out
for
failure
to
exhaust.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
that
back
in
my
dr.
x,
dr.
y
case,
under
the
new
policy
if
they
got
to
stage
2
and
y
was
identified,
that
michigan
would
process
the
complaint?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
grievance.
