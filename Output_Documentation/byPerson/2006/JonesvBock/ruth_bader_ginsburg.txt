justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
andre,
didn't
you
have
in
one
of
that's
cases
that
the
exhaustion
was
spelled
out
by
the
defendant,
there
was
a
complaint
that
alleged
exhaustion,
generally
but
not
in
all
detail.
then
the
answer
attached
every
piece
of
paper
that
came
up
at
all
three
levels
of
the
grievance
procedure,
and
then
the
plaintiff
said
oh,
that's
a
good
idea,
i'm
going
to
copy
all
those
documents
and
make
them
my
own.
and
nonetheless,
that
case
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
allege
exhaustion
in
sufficient
detail
although
the
record
made
it
plain
that
there
had
been
exhaustion.
the
rule
that
you
are
opposing
would
operate
that
way.
if
you
don't
allege
exhaustion
in
detail,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
deficiency
has
been
made
up
by
the
answer.
you
go
out.
wasn't
that
the
decision
in
one
of
these
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if
we
accept
your
first
two
arguments,
then
if
there
is
no
heightened
pleading
rule
and
you
don't
have
to
name
the
specific
defendants
in
the
administrative
grievance
that
you
end
up
naming
in
the
complaint,
if
you
prevail
on
both
of
those,
then
isn't
the
third
question,
have
you,
what
happens
when
you
haven't
properly
exhausted,
is
really
not
alive
anymore
in
this
case,
because
you
will
have
properly
exhausted.
so
why
should
the
court
go
on
to
answer
what
would
happen
if
you
hadn't
properly
exhausted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
sixth
circuit
obviously
would
have
been
wrong;
if
he
has
totally
exhausted;
they
have,
gave
that
as
a
no
alternative
grounds,
but
if
they
are
wrong
on
the
first
one
and
he
has
exhausted.
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
case
where
the,
where
the
defendant
estate,
wasn't
that
the
case
where
they
put
in
all
the
papers
from
the
administrative
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
they
were
wrong
about
that.
if,
if
there
was
exhaustion
in
the
case,
and
if
there
is
no
rule
that
you
must
name
everything
the
defendant
that
you
end
up
suing,
if
those
two
are
established,
again
wouldn't
we
be
dealing
with
a
moot
question?
moot
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
have
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
person
has
said:
i
didn't
know
who
was
the
person
who
said
i
couldn't
have
the
operation
until
the
prison
identified
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
so
even
if
you
had
a
rule,
a
reasonable
rule,
that
named
the
people
that
you
know,
if
you
have
it,
that
would
not
encompass
someone?
in
two
of
these
cases,
the
defendants...
the
plaintiff,
the
prisoner,
said,
i
didn't
know
who
those
guys
were
until
they
were
identified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
doesn't
include
failure
to
exhaust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
you
follow
the
normal
rule,
that
that's
an
affirmative
defense,
then,
then
the
burden
would
be
on
the
prison
to
do
just
what
it
did
in
the
jones
case.
why,
why
would
we
say,
depart
from
the
normal
rule
that
makes
exhaustion
an
affirmative
defense
when
we
know
that
the
party
best
equipped
to
provide
the
information
about
exhaustion
is
the
prison,
as
the
jones
case
showed
so
well?
they,
the
prison,
had
all
of
the
grievances.
they
had
all
of
the
responses
and
they
presented
that
to
the
court.
so
the
prisoner
is
less
well
equipped
to
attach
those
papers
than
the
prison
is,
so
why
isn't
it
not
only
traditional
to
have
exhaustion
as
an
affirmative
defense,
but
makes
the
most
sense
because
the
one
most
likely
to
have
the
information
is
the
prison?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
congress
meant
to
reverse
the
ordinary
burden
on
pleading
exhaustion,
why
didn't
it
put
that
in?
it
was
expanding
the
categories
and
it
included
failure
to
state
a
claim,
which
had
not
been
there
before,
and
it
included
if
you
sue
somebody
who
has
got
immunity.
but
it
didn't
include
exhaustion,
so
why
should
we
read
that
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
in
the
screening.
it
doesn't
say
you
screen
out
for
failure
to
exhaust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
other
provisions
than
"no
action
shall
be
brought".
take
a
statute
of
limitations
that
reads
"no
action
shall
be
brought
after
two
years.
"
or
something
like
that.
there
is
no
action
shall
be
brought.
does
that
make
it
no
longer
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
all
the
criteria
are
there,
but
failure
to
exhaust
is
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
last
time...
and
you
said
before
the
statute
was
there
were
only
frivolous
and
malicious.
and
the
court
says,
we
can
see
from
the
face
of
this
complaint
that
it
fails
to
state
a
claim,
too
bad
it's
not
a
ground
for
automatic
dismissal.
so
congress
said,
yes,
it
should
be,
and
put
that
one
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
not...
the
statute
doesn't
settle
that.
our
decisions
settle
that,
right?
so
why
should
we
deal
with
that,
the
two,
any
differently?
it's
not
as
though
congress
wrote
the
statute
differently.
we
said
you
can't
proceed
with
unexhausted
claims,
so
you
have
a
choice.
either
you
go
out
of
the
federal
court
and
exhaust
everything...
or
even
you
don't
have
to
go
out;
you
could
use
the
stay
in
abeyance...
or
you
just
lob
off
the
unexhausted
claims,
stay
in
the
federal
court
on
the
ones
that
you
have
exhausted.
that's
all
made
up
by
this
court.
so
why
should
the
court
react
differently
in
the
plra
than
it
did?
why
should
it
fill
those
gaps
differently
than
it
did
in
habeas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
suggesting
that
in
habeas
it
is
the
prisoner's
option
to
say
i
don't
want
the
whole
case
dismissed.
i
will
amend
my
petition
so
that
the
court
will
have,
will
retain
the
exhausted
claims.
you
are
saying
not
like
habeas,
i
don't
want
it
to
be
like
habeas,
because
if
it
were
like
habeas,
the
prisoner
would
have
the
option
to
stay
in
the
federal
court
as
long
as
he
lopped
off
the
unexhausted
claims.
you
don't
want
it.
you
don't
want
it
to
be
like
habeas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
requirement?
as
long
as
he
has
made
known
in
the
administrative
proceeding
what
his
problem
it,
and
they
have
had
a
chance
to
investigate
it
and
determine
whether
it
has
merit
or
not,
why
should
he
have
to
name
the
individuals
who
made
the
decision
in
order,
before
he
can
sue
them
when
he
later
finds
out
who
they
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
jones,
who
really
did
not
know
who
was
the
doctor
who
said
no
surgery?
he
didn't
know
and
then
the
prison
told
him.
and
he
comes
to
the
court,
he
says
thanks,
prison,
for
telling
me,
and
so
he
names
that
person
in
his
complaint.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that's
no
good,
he
didn't
put
it
in
his
initial
complaint.
he
had
only
15
days
to
find
out
and
he
didn't
find
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
jones
did
properly
exhaust,
then,
if
you
just
made
that
confession,
then
jones
properly
exhausted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
an
absolute
policy,
though.
it
isn't
that
if
you
haven't
named
him
in
the
first
administrative
step,
you
can't
name
him
in
the
complaint.
that's
not
michigan's
new
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
an
exception
when
you
couldn't
find
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
no
leeway
built
into
the
rule
itself,
that
if
you
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
there...
the
current
rule,
isn't
there
some
leeway
for
cases
where
the
prisoner
simply
doesn't
know
the
names?
