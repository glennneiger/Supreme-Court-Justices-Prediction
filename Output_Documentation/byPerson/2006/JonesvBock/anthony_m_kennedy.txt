suppose
the
district
court
finds
that
in
its
experience,
80
percent
of
the
claims
are
ones
that
are
unexhausted,
just
assume
that.
and
the
district
court
said,
the
only
way
i
can
figure
out
the
good
20
percent
from
the
80
percent
that
are
going
to
ultimately
be
dismissed
is
to
have
a
motion
for
a
more
definite,
an
order
for
a
more
definite
statement,
because
i'll
do
it
sua
sponte
under
12(e),
i
think.
can
the
district
court
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court
could
ask
for
a
pleading
which
set
forth
the
facts
of
exhaustion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
isn't
this...
this
is
just
the
same
if
the
court
has
said,
you
know,
in
order
to
make
our
screening
function
efficient,
we
just
have
to
know
about
exhaustion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about,
what,
if
you
concede
the
district
court
could
do
it
in
individual
cases
or
in
most
cases,
why
can't
the
sixth
circuit
do
it?
that's
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
argument
that
if
the
state
does
not
insist
on
exhaustion
or
plead
exhaustion,
that
it
just
drops
out
of
the
case?
if
the
state
resolves
the
case
on
the
merits
even
though
there
is
no
exhaustion,
can
the
federal
court
hear
it,
that
there
is
general
agreement
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no,
it's
standard
law
of
agency.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
prisoner
is
denied
his
rights.
as
justice
stevens
said,
there
may
be
three
or
four
different
people
who
concurred.
do
your
rules
say
that
if
he
can't
find
out
with
reasonable
efforts
that
he
doesn't
need
to,
or
does
the
sixth
circuit
rules
say
that
the
delegation
of
the
names
is
not
required?
