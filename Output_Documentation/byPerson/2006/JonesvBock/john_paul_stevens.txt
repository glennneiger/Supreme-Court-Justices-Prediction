justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
draconian?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
have
to
file
a
new
filing
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
what
is
a
typical
administrative
record
that
is
developed
in
these
proceedings?
there's
never
a
transcript,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
normally
a
statement
of
reasons
for
the
denial
of
relief
or
are
they
just
denied
in
many
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
opinions
a
page
or
two
or
just
a
sentence
or
two?
what
is
typical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
how,
how
much
help
that
will
give
the
judge
later
on
in
processing
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
of
the
13,000
are
of
that
variety?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
the
other
question:
of
the
13,000
grievances,
how
many
did
result
in
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
200
out
of
13,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
explain
what
the
disincentive
or
other
reasons
for
there
being
just
200
lawsuits
out
of
the
13,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about,
there's
another
question
you
haven't
really
touched
on
yet,
the
requirement
that
the
prisoner
name
every
defendant
that
he
intends
to
sue
in
the
exhausting,
in
the
internal
procedure.
i'd
just
like
a
little
help
on
just
exactly
what
happens.
the
prisoner
doesn't
get
the
kind
of
medical
care
he
thinks
he's
entitled
to,
and
he
only
knows
it
because
either
the
low
level
person
says
no,
the
doctors
said
you
can't
have
it.
and
he
brings
a
proceeding,
an
informal
administrative
proceeding,
and
they
deny
relief.
and
then
later
on
when
he
wants
to
sue,
his
lawyer
happens
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
doctor
who
was
involved,
and
there
are
several
levels
of
authority
making
the
decision.
does
he
have
to
start
all
over
again
to
name
those
people,
or
what
does
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
he
does
talk
to
the
prison
guard
and
the
guard
says
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
who's
responsible
for
that
decision,
that's
in
the
warden's
office,
or
something
like
that.
what
is
the
prisoner
supposed
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
doesn't?
one
of
his
grievances
is
nobody
told
me.
is
he
out
of
luck
there?
and
i
think
there
may
well
be
situations
in
which
prisoners
don't
have
complete
access
to
all
the
facts
that
go
into
a
decision
denying
them
medical
care,
for
example,
or
say
a
prisoner
has
a
religious
problem
and
can't
get
the
diet
he
wants,
or
something
like
that.
but
before
he
can
sue,
under
your
view
if
i
understand
it,
he
has
to
find
out
so
he
can
name
the
people
in
his
administrative
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
you
say
the
primary
purpose
is
to
relieve
the
courts
of
the
burden
rather
than
determine
whether
there
is
merits
to
the
grievances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation,
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
any
interest
in
determining
whether
the
complaints
have
merit?
i
mean,
i
think
you
must
be
interested
in
getting
rid
of
11,000
complaints
and
reducing
them
down
to
200.
i
would
think
that's
more
important
than
saving
the
court
some
time.
there
must
be,
you
must
have
some
interest
in
determining
whether
the
complaints
have
merit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
these
rules
that
are
challenged
here
are
primarily
to
benefit
the
courts,
not
the
profits...
the
process.
