justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
briefs
point
out
that
a
number
of
district
courts
have
form
complaints
that
are
often
used
in
these
cases
and
that
these
forms
call
on
the
prisoner-plaintiff
to
address
the
issue
of
exhaustion.
now,
do
you
think
there's
something
wrong
with
those
forms,
and
if
a
prisoner
fills
out
the
form
and
reveals
in
filling
it
out
that
a
claim
was
not
exhausted,
is
it
improper
for
the
district
court
at
the
screening
stage
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
then
why
is
it...
why
is
it
proper
for
a
district
court,
for
a
district
court,
to
have
a
form
that
calls
on
the
plaintiff
to
negate
the
affirmative
defense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
1997(e)
and
(g),
which
prohibits,
seems
to
prohibit
a
case
from
getting
beyond
the
complaint,
not
even
to
the
answer
unless
the
district
court
finds
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prevail
on
the
merits.
doesn't
this
clearly
take
this
out
of
the
normal
pleading
procedures?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
prisoner
is
going
to
have
to
file,
and
the
individuals
defendants
are
going
to
have
to
file
an
answer
in
every
case
and
assert
all
of
their
defenses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
respond,
even
if
there
is
nonfrivolous,
nonexhaustion
argument
that
can
be
made,
they
are
going
to
have
to
go
through
all
of
that
in
every
instance?
