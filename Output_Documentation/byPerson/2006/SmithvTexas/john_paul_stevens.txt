john
paul
stevens
may
i,
may
i
ask
this
question
about
your
position?
is
it
your
position
that
they
should
not
have
applied
any
harmless
error
review,
or
that
they
applied
the
wrong
standard?
and
if
it's
the
latter,
what
was
the
standard
they
should
have
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
be
preserving
the
chapman
standard
if
it
was
federal
collateral
review,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
difference
between
waiving
it
as
a
procedural
bar
and
waiving
it
as
an
objection
to
the
proper
standard
of
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
cruz,
is
it
not
true
that
if
he
did
fail
to
preserve
the
objection
then
there
should
have
been
a
procedural
bar
to
the
case
going
forward?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
are
saying
that
the
failure
to
object
does
not
constitute...
would
constitute
a
procedural
bar
if
we
elected
to
treat
it
that
way,
but
we've
decided
not
to,
but
we're
nevertheless
going
to
rely
on
the
failure
to
object
to
justify
a
higher
standard
of
review
on
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
precedent
for
that
ambivalent
use
of
a
potential
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cruz,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
did
the
texas
court
of
appeals
say
in
effect,
there
is
a
procedural
bar
but
we're
going
to
waive
it,
or
did
they
just
not
address
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
assuming
there's
longstanding
precedents.
it
is
also
at
least
conceivable
that
at
the
time
they
thought
the
objection
was
properly
preserved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
assuming
that
they
decided
to
be
more
lenient
rather
than
assuming
that
they
may
have
actually
decided
and
rejected
the
procedural
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
at
least
possible
on
this
record,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
cite
that
case
in
this
case,
in
this
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
both
collateral
review
and
direct
review,
or
just
collateral
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
question
is
a
little
different.
if
you
had
two
harmless
errors
in
a
given
state,
do
they
have
to
apply
them
consistently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
for
example
the
higher
standard
only
applies
to
unpreserved
error
and
the
record
clearly
establishes
and
the
several
state
judges
confirm
there
was
no
unpreserved
error,
then
would
there
not
be
a
duty
to
apply
the
lower
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
state
follows
the
rule
in
just
one
exceptional
case
before
the
federal
court,
can
the
court
said,
hey,
you're
not
following
your
regular
rule?
