mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
postulates
govern
this
case.
first,
reconciling
jurek
and
johnson
and
graham
on
the
one
hand
and
penry
ii
and
tennard
and
smith
ii
on
the
other
hand
is
not
an
easy
task
and
state
and
federal
courts
have
struggled
for
two
decades
to
draw
the
appropriate
lines
and
to
faithfully
apply
this
court's
penry
jurisprudence.
second,
the
usual
default
rule
in
both
state
and
federal
court
is
that
most
constitutional
errors
are
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
state
habeas--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is
an
issue
that
on
the
reply
brief
petitioner
has
essentially
conceded.
in
footnote
5
petitioner
states
that
he
is
not
seeking
reversal
on
the
basis
that
penry
error
is
structural
error.
but
that
is
the
issue
of
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
to
us.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
not
in
this
case
because
of
petitioner's
concession,
but
petitioner's
concession
has
serious
consequences
because
the
only
ground
upon
which
petitioner
can
prevail
in
this
court
is
that
the
state
court's
application
of
harmless
error
violated
the
united
states
constitution
and
by
giving
up
his
structural
error
argument
he
gives
up
virtually
any
basis
to
lay
out
why
that
would
violate
the
u.s.
constitution,
not
simply
why
it
was
incorrect
but
why
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
state
court
to
apply
that
doctrine.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
i
do
not
disagree
with
you.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
do
not
disagree
with
you
that
if
the
state
court
had
concluded
for
petitioner
on
a
state
ground
to
begin
with
and
after
being
reversed
revisited
that
conclusion--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
there
is
no
suggestion--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that's
not
what
happened
here
and
so
we
are
not
urging
that
ground
to
support
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did.
but
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
the
almanza
standard,
the
state
harmless
error
standard,
is
a
two-step
inquiry.
inquiry
number
one,
is
there
error;
and
under
state
law
if
you
conclude
no
the
analysis
ends.
so
the
first
time
the
state
court
considered
this
it
concluded
there
is
no
constitutional
error
and
so
it
never
addressed
harmless
error.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
not
exactly
how
the
state
court
and
state
law
does
it.
what
the
state
law
does
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
failed
to
preserve
his
objection
because
he
did
not
object
specifically
on
the
grounds--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
is
not
a
procedural
bar--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--because
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
chosen
to
forgive
failure
to
preserve
for
purposes
of
procedural
default
and
subsequent
habeas
rights.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
let
me
suggest
it's
not
an
ambivalent
use,
but
rather
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held,
in
the
black
case
it
held
that
penry
i
was
so
novel
that
the
state
courts
would
excuse
a
failure
to
preserve
for
purposes
of
procedural
bar.
so
in
this
regard
the
state
court
is
more
forgiving
to
defendant
than
the
federal
courts
are.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
you're
right
that
in
smith
i,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
majority
did
not
explain
why
there
wasn't
a
procedural
bar.
but
there
had
been
a
long
line
of
cases
where
the
cca
had
decided
penry
errors
were
not
going
to
bar
access
to
the
courthouse,
and
just
last
week
in
another
decision
that
was
decided
after
briefing
in
the
case,
in
the
in
re
hood
case,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
made
clear
that
in
its
judgment
penry
ii
was
also
so
novel
that
for
purposes
of
successive
risk
it
would
excuse
a
failure
to
preserve.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
black
they
said
exactly
what
you
say.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
this
case
they
didn't...
they
didn't
say
because
longstanding
cca
precedent
made
clear
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
is
conceivable,
but
i
would
suggest
the
more
reasonable
inference
is
they
followed
their
long
line
of
precedents
that
said
we're
not
going
to
interpose,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
a
total
bar
to
raising
these
claims.
so
for
procedural
default
and
for
successive
writs,
we're
not
going
to
penalize
petitioners
for
failing
to
make
objections.
just
because
the
state
court
decides
to
be
more
lenient
than
the
federal
courts
in
that
respect
does
not
mean
that
they
also
need
to
apply
the
lesser
standard
of--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--they
did
not
say
one
way
or
the
other
the
first
time.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
most
reasonable
explanation
for
that,
justice
souter,
i
would
suggest
is
at
the
time
of
smith
iii
the
court
had
not
decided
hood,
which
means
it
had
not
concluded
that
penry
ii
was
also
so
novel
that
it
would
forgive
failure
to
raise
it.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
would
arguably
be
the
case
if
on
remand
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
applied
procedural
default
and
refused
to
consider
the
case...
the
claim,
but
not
what
it
did.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
respectfully,
they
are
altogether
separate
concepts
that
procedural
default
is
a
total
bar
to
the
courthouse.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
black
had.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
black
had
and
almanza
had.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
black
is
what
excused
the
failure
to
raise
penry
i
for
novelty.
and
so
it
was
clearly
established
state
law
at
the
time
of
this
trial--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
the--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
the
hood...
the
hood
decision
with
respect
to
penry
ii
is
being
forgiving
to
criminal
defendant.
it's
not
a
bar.
it's
forgiving
a
bar.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
almanza
standard
which
had
been
present
for...
has
been
present
in
state
law
for
over
20
years
is
suddenly
inadequate.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
they
absolutely
cited
almanza.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
respectfully,
justice
breyer,
that
is
not
what
we
are
urging,
and
i'm
very
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
i'd
like
to
clarify
what
we
are
urging
in
our
brief.
that
is
not
why
we
think
smith
is
not
defaulted.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
don't
know
if
there
is
or
not
but
our--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--our
argument
is
not
based
on
the
timing
of
the
objection,
so
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
when
he
did
or
didn't
raise
his
objection.
and
so--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that
is
not--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
argument
is
that
he
made
a
different
objection,
a
substantively
different
objection,
because
what
he
filed
was
an
argument
that
the
texas
death
penalty
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
across
the
board
and
as
applied
to
him,
and
he
made
a
conscious
strategic
choice
which
is,
when
the
judge
presented
a
charge
to
the
counsel
and
said
do
you
have
any
objections,
do
you
have
any
suggestions,
is
there
any
way
i
can
change
it,
he
could
have
done
what
penry's
counsel
did.
penry's
counsel
twice
asked
the
judge,
please
instruct
the
jury
on
deliberateness
so
they
can
consider
my
mitigating
evidence
for
deliberateness.
penry
i
said
that
would
solve
the
penry
problem.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
he
was
categorically
wrong
about
that,
and
that
fundamentally--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--yes.
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
because
penry
i,
which
has
already
been
decided,
this
court
has
said
the
way
to
correct
a
penry
error
is
to
give
an
instruction.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
following
penry
had
already
squarely
held
the
way
to
correct
a
penry
error
is
to
give
an
instruction.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
penry
i
said,
a
deliberateness
instruction
or
a
catch-all
instruction.
so...
but
in
both
cases,
both
this
court
and
the
state
court
have
said
judges
can
give
an
instruction.
and
penry
i's
counsel
made--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
in
fact
what
the
judge
did
here.
what
the
judge
could
do
clearly
under
texas
law
is
give
any
reasonable
instruction
to
cure
the
error.
what
the
judge
couldn't
do
is
submit
a
third
special
issue.
it
couldn't
ask
the
jury,
check,
is
there
enough
mitigating
evidence
to
sentence
to
death.
so
it
couldn't
change
the
output
from
the
jury.
it
couldn't
add
a
new
special
issue
but
it
could
give
any
instruction
possible
to
correct
the
error.
that
was
texas
law,
that
you
could
give
instructions,
but
the
special
issues
are
set
by
statute.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
they
also
have
a
written
charge,
so
they
get
a
written
charge
with
the
instruction.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
this
court
said
in
both
penry
i
and
penry
ii
that
if
the
trial
judge
defined
deliberateness
appropriately,
even
under
the
old
special
issues,
that
it
could
solve
the
problem.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
what
the
attorney...
the
attorney
didn't
say
that
won't
work
because
it
puts
jurors
in
an
ethical
quandary,
it
causes
them
to
violate
the
oath.
what
the
attorney
said
is,
you
can
give
no
instructions.
and
the
reason
for
that
strategic
choice
is
that
smith's
counsel
made
the
judgment,
i
want
it
to
be
impossible
for
my
client
to
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
had
smith's
counsel
made
the
same
objection
that
penry
made,
had
he
read
penry
right
in
front
of
him
and
asked,
give
me
a
deliberateness
instruction,
it
would
have
cured
the
error.
but
the
reason
i
would
suggest
that
smith's
counsel
didn't
is
that
the
quantum
of
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case
was
so
slight
compared
to
the
pervious
cases
that
he
made
a
very
conscious
strategic
choice,
i'd
rather
go
all
or
nothing.
i
would
rather
make
an
argument
that
there
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
the
evidence
was
precisely
that
he
had
been
sweet
and
kind.
over
90
percent
of
the
evidence
that
defense
counsel
relied
on
in
closing
was
the
15
character
witnesses
to
show
that
he
was
a
big
lovable
teddy
bear
and
went
to
church,
and
was
sweet
and
kind,
and
he
had
overcome
these
obstacles,
and
this
was
a
momentary
aberration.
that
was
the
central
theme
of
defense's
arguments.
and
in
fact
when
the
court--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i'm
talking--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well...
and
it's
interesting.
the
several
hundred
pages
they
talk
about,
there
are
three
iq
tests
that
he
had
gotten.
when
he
was
7
years
old
he
tested
at
87;
when
he
was
10
years
old
he
tested
at
87;
when
he
was
13
he
tested
at
78.
they...
and
they
introduced
all
three.
these
were
the
school
records.
there
weren't
competing
experts.
it's
interesting
in
closing
arguments--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
souter,
not
only
was
it
a
very
small
part
of
the
presentation,
but
in
closing
argument
defense
counsel
explicitly
pointed
out
to
the
jury
that...
and
let
me
read
from
defense
counsel's
closing:
"i
think
it
speaks
well
for
both
sides,
the
state
and
the
defense
to
be
quite
honest,
that
we
didn't
bring
you
some
hired
gun,
some
psychiatrist
that
gets
paid
to
get
up
here
and
say
oh
well,
these
are
all
family
problems.
"
and
that
is
at
33,
volume
33
of
the
record,
page
59.
he
affirmatively...
in
penry
the
whole
argument
was
there's
iq
problems,
there's
serious
abuse.
there's
no
abuse
in
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
no
allegation
of
abuse
whatsoever.
and
he
affirmatively
said
to
the
jury,
look,
we're
not
relying
on
some
psychiatrist
saying
there
are
all
these
family
problems.
our
story
is
that
this
is
a
good
person
who
led
a
good
life
and
this
is
an
aberration.
