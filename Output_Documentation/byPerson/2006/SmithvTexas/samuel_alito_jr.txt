justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
sounds
like
you're
arguing
that
the
texas
court
misapplied
texas
law,
and
you
want
us
to
reverse
their
application
of
their
own
law
about
what
is
an
adequate
objection.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
an
adequate...
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that,
in
fact,
there
was
an
adequate
objection.
and
if
the,
if
the
state
court
held
against
you
on
that
point,
that's
an
issue
of
texas
law,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
special
federal
harmless
error
standard
that
applies
to
unpreserved
error?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
for
federal,
that's
in
the
federal
courts.
but
there
isn't
one
that's
applicable
able
to
the
state
courts,
is
there?
