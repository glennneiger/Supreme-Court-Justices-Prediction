justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
find
it
could
or
did
they
find
that
it
did?
i
thought
our
holding
was
that
given
the
instructions,
the
jury
would
not
necessarily
take
into
account
those
mitigating
factors,
and
i
thought
that
what
the
texas
court
held
is,
yes,
that
was
a
possibility,
and
we
have
to
see
whether
that
possibility
came
to
pass,
which
is
what
harmless
error
analysis
involves.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
are
not
contradicting
the
fact
that
the
jury
wasn't
required
to
take
it
into
account,
but
they
are
saying
nonetheless,
in
our
view,
the
jury
did
take
it
into
account,
and
therefore,
the
error
was
harmless.
that
doesn't
contradict
our
opinion.
i
mean,
you
might
want
to
argue
against
it
on
the
merits,
but
i
don't
think
that
will
contradict
our
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and
that
means
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
to
take
it
into
account.
and
i
think
the
texas
court
is
conceding
that.
but
it's,
it's
saying,
nonetheless,
we
don't
think
that
the
error
made
any
difference
because,
in
our
view,
the
jury
did
take
it
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
thing
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
saying
the
instruction
was
okay.
and
it's
something
else
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
saying
even
though
the
instruction
didn't
require
that,
it
was
a
fuzzy
instruction
and
a
juror
could
very
reasonably
have
understood
it
not
to
allow
nullification,
nonetheless,
we
have
satisfied
ourselves
that
the
jury
indeed
thought
it
had
the
nullification
power.
i
don't
see
how
it
contradicts
our
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
it
was
an
adequate
vehicle.
i
mean,
they
acknowledged
that
that
instruction
shouldn't
be
given
again
because
it
doesn't
require
the
jury
to
do
what,
what
you
say
the
jury
must
do,
and
i
think
they
accept
that.
they
say,
oh,
no,
i
thought
it
was
fuzzy,
and
didn't
require...
we
think
the
jury
did
indeed
think
it
had
the
power
to
nullify.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
and
this
was
unpreserved
error.
i
mean,
they
are
not
saying
this
for
everything.
they
are
saying
he
did
not
object
to
the
instructions
at
the
time
and
therefore
our
harmless
error
standard
is...
is
more
rigorous
than
it
would
otherwise
be.
what's
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that's
a
very
generalized
argument,
and
what
he
won
on
was
a
very
specific
point
that,
that
this
instruction
in
effect
required,
if
they
were
going
to
give
mitigating
effect,
required
a
jury
nullification.
that's
a
very
specific
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
did
not
object...
he
did
not
object
to
that
specific
problem.
had
he
objected,
the
court
would
have
said,
you
know,
there
is
something
to
what
you
say,
and
i'll
give
a
different
instruction.
but
he
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
make
up
our
own
procedural
rules,
too?
i
mean,
why,
why...
why
is
it
just
a
federal
judgment
as
to
whether
it
adequately
complied
with
the
texas
rule?
presumably
we
should
make
up
our
own
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
you
say
it's
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
a
little
bit
different
from
your,
from
your
response
to
justice
souter.
you
are
making
a
much
narrower
argument.
you,
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
assert
that
in
every
case
when
there
is
a
procedural
objection
in
a
capital
case
or
any
case
involving
federal
law,
federal
law
will
determine
whether
the
procedural
objection
is
adequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
just
don't...
you
say
whenever,
whenever
a
court
decides
the
case
on
the
merits
instead
of
using
an
intervening
procedural
objection,
the
procedural
objection
is
waived.
justice
antonin
scalia
especially
in
capital
cases,
courts
don't
like
to
say,
oh,
you
know,
yes,
you
may
be
innocent
but
there's
this
procedural
objection.
i
think
most
courts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
my
experience
with
a
lot
of
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
gives
the
state
court
the
power
to,
as
you
say,
waive
that
objection?
i
can
understand
when
you
say
the
prosecutor
didn't
object.
it's
the
prosecutor
that
has
the
power
to
forfeit
certain
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
people
which
he
chooses
not
to
raise.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
reason,
mr.
schaerr,
why
that
would
be
more
egregious
when
the
federal
constitutional
question
has
been
answered
by
a
federal
district
court
than
it
is
when
the
federal
constitutional
question
has
been
answered
by
the
state
supreme
court?
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
bad
when
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
the
federal
constitution
has
been
violated
and
then
the
case
goes
back
to
the
lower
state
court
and
the
lower
state
court
applies
some
standard
for
plain
error
which
is,
which
is
simply
different
from
what
is,
what
is
being
urged
here
today.
i'm
sure
that
happens
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
know
why
it's
any
worse,
any
worse
when
you
do
it
to
a
federal
district
court's
determination
of
what
the
federal
constitution
says
than
when
you
do
it
to
the
state
supreme
court's
determination
of
what
the
federal
constitution
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
haven't
had
the
issue
before
us,
have
we?
that's
why
you're
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
reason
would
apply
equally,
however,
to
determinations
of
federal
rights
by
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
everybody
understands
that
state
courts
do
this
all
the
time,
and
indeed
a
good
way
to
do
an
end
run
around
what,
what,
what
the
other
side
in
this
case
seems
to
want
is
simply
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
find
a
violation
of
federal
law
so
that
it
doesn't
get
to
a
federal
court
and
then
have
the
state
lower
court
apply
whatever
harmless
error
standard
it
wishes,
which
would
be
a
crazy
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you're
going
to
adopt
this
rule,
this
rule
would
have
to
be
adopted
not
only
for
references
back
to
the
state
court
from
a
federal
decision,
but
you
would
surely
have
to
apply
it
to
all
state
determinations
of
federal
law,
and
i
don't
really
know
what
authority
we
would
have
to
require
lower
state
courts
to
do
that.
