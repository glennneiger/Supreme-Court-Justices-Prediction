mr.
jordan
steiker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
for
the
second
time.
in
your
summary
of
reversal,
this
court
held
that
petitioner's
mitigating
evidence
could
not
be
given
adequate
consideration
through
the
texas
special
issues
or
the
nullification
instructions.
on
remand,
the
cca
found
the
error
harmless
by
concluding
the
opposite,
that
petitioner's
jury
could
give
sufficient
consideration
to
his
mitigating
evidence,
including
specifically
the
evidence
of
his
78
iq,
learning
disabilities
and
troubled
background.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think,
justice
scalia,
what
the--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
think
it
does
contradict
your
opinion,
justice
scalia.
your
opinion
said
that
petitioner's
mitigating
evidence
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
inquiries
of
the
special
issues,
and
your
opinion
also
said
that
the
nullification
instruction,
no
matter
how
clearly
conveyed
or
fully
understood
by
the
jury,
would
not
solve
that
problem.
mr.
jordan
steiker
the
matter
in
which
the
cca
posited
that
the
jury
could
take
it
into
account
was
the
fact
that
on
voir
dire,
the
jurors
said
we
can
follow
a
nullification
instruction
and
falsify
our
answers
to
the
special
issues
in
order
to
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence.
that
was
the
exact
same
proposition
that
the
cca
had
issued
in
its
first
opinion
that
this
court
summarily
reversed.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think
what's
contradictory,
your
honor,
is
that
the
notion
that
the
nullification
instruction
would
be
an
adequate
vehicle
was
what
this
court
specifically
rejected.
mr.
jordan
steiker
and
i
would
also
add
that
when
you
actually
look
at
the
voir
dire
on
which
the
cca
relied
in
which
it
said
jurors
express
no
discomfort,
no
hesitation
about
their
willingness
to
falsify
their
answers
to
the
special
issues,
the
very
first
juror
in
this
case,
a
lawyer,
expressed
exactly
the
kinds
of
discomfort
that
this
court
feared
and
anticipated
with
the
use
of
the
nullification
instruction.
mr.
jordan
steiker
justice
souter,
we
do
not
concede
that,
but
nor
do
we
rely
on
that
as
a
basis
for
relief
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
purported
harmless
error
analysis
that
the
cca
applied
was
so
interwoven
with
a
rejection
of
the
federal
constitutional--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--yes,
it
was.
it
was
raised
on
remand
from
this
court.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
would
say
ordinarily
this
court
is
not
in
as
good
a
position
as
a
state
court
to
conduct
harmless
error
analysis.
our
belief
here
is
that
the,
the
basis
for
the
state
finding
the
error
harmless
was
a
very
unusual
rejection
of
the
conclusion
that
this,
these
instructions
would
facilitate
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
application
of
harmless
error
analysis,
when
it's
predicated
on
a
misunderstanding
of
federal
constitutional
law,
is
not
an
independent
basis
for
decision.
it's
clearly
wrapped
up
in
the
federal
claim,
and
i
think
this
court's
cases
have
clearly
so
held.
mr.
jordan
steiker
it's,
it's
certainly
possible.
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
usual
practice
and
i
wouldn't
advocate
that
here.
and
this
is
not
a
usual
case
in
which
the
state
has
conducted
an
ordinary
harmless
error
analysis.
the
state
has
actually
in
no
way
disparaged
the
power
and
extent
of
petitioner's
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
jordan
steiker
generally
speaking,
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
with
some
limitations.
mr.
jordan
steiker
well,
on
direct
review,
chapman
clearly
says
it's
a
federal
question
what
the
standard
of
review
may
be.
and
on
direct
review,
it's
undoubted
that
a
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
required
by
chapman.
this
case
doesn't
present
the
issue
on
whether
on
state...
post-conviction,
a
state
can
have
the
latitude
of
requiring
greater
harm,
because
on
the
cca's
own
analysis,
the
standard
of
harm
that's
applied
on
state
habeas
is
identical
to
the
standard
of
harm
that's
applied
on
direct
review,
the
standard
of
almanza,
which
posits
chapman
error,
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
preserved
error,
and
egregious
harm
for
unpreserved
error.
mr.
jordan
steiker
and
we...
we
argue
that
there
are
three
independent
bases,
federal
bases
for
finding
that
the
application
of
egregious
harm
in
this
case
to
be
violative
of
federal
rights.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
first
of
those
arguments.
petitioner
plainly
objected
that
the
special
issues
and
verdict
form
did
not
allow
for
consideration
of
his
mitigating
evidence.
that
was
and
remains
his
core
argument
throughout
this
case.
mr.
jordan
steiker
on
that--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--everyone
at
trial
understood
that
the
special
issues
on
the
verdict
form
were
unalterable,
that
texas
law
required
the
legislature
to
specify
what
was
on
the
special
verdict
form.
what
the
trial
court
invited
counsel
to
do
was
to
offer
a
different
form
of
nullification
in
the
supplemental
instruction
that
would
then
interpret
the
special
issues.
this
court's
opinion
in
its
summary
reversal
made
plain
that
the
problem
with
nullification
instructions
is
broad
and
intractable
and
applies
to
all
nullification
instructions.
mr.
jordan
steiker
there's
nothing--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
have
special
responses,
your
honor.
the
objection
to
the
special
verdict
form
and
the
special
issues
was
made
plain
in
pretrial
motions
and
that
objection
was
clearly
recognized
by
the
trial
judge
at
trial
and
denied
at
trial
when
the
instructions
were
being
considered
for
the
purposes
of
voir
dire.
mr.
jordan
steiker
the
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
invoke
this
basis
for
saying
that
his
trial
objection
was
inadequate.
they
didn't
say
that
it
was
made
at
the
wrong
time,
or
in
the
wrong...
what
they
specifically
said--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
misspoke
if
i...
i
conveyed
the
impression
that
they
did
not
suggest
that
it
was
inadequate
objection.
i
was
merely
suggesting
that
it
wasn't
inadequate
in
the
sense
that
it
was
made
at
the
wrong
time,
pretrial
or
at
trial.
mr.
jordan
steiker
it
was
the
understanding
of
everyone.
it's
reflected
in
the
record
in
the
first
state
habeas
opinion
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
acknowledges
that
the
verdict
form
was
sacrosanct.
that
was
not
going
to
be
altered,
so
the
nature
of
the
cca's
suggested
failing
of
petitioner
was
that
he
did
not
specifically
object
to
the
nullification
instruction.
mr.
jordan
steiker
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
cca
misunderstood
the
federal
law
of
the
relationship
between
penry
i
and
penry
ii.
the
failing
in
this
case
was
a
verdict
form
that
made
no
mention
of
mitigating
evidence.
the
nullification
instruction
was
the
state's
flawed
defense
to
that
failing.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
don't
think
it
is
an
issue
of
texas
law,
your
honor,
because
the
basis
for
the
finding
that
it
was
inadequate
was
that
he
had
to
separately
object
to
the
nullification
instruction
as
opposed
to
what
everyone
agreed
he
object
to,
was
the
inadequacy
of
the
verdict
form.
that
was
his
federal
claim.
and
our
view
is
that
the
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
the
federal
claim
was
what
led
the
texas
court
to
conclude
that
his
objection
was
inadequate.
i'd
also
like
to--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jordan
steiker
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
don't
think
you
need
to
make
up--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--it's
a
federal
question
about
what
the
nature
of
the
claim
is,
and
if
the
state's
misunderstanding
of
the
federal
claim
was
what
was
intertwined
with
its
conclusion
that
it
was
an
inadequate
objection,
that
is
a
misunderstanding
of
federal
law.
we
also
believe
that
the
procedural,
that
the
application--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
believe
our,
i
believe
our
right
to
be--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
agree
with
that
fully,
your
honor.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
an
error
can
be
deemed
harmless
is
always
a
federal
question.
chapman
says
as
much.
mr.
jordan
steiker
well,
clearly
ake
vs.
oklahoma
holds
that
if
the
state
invocation
of
the
procedural
rule
is
dependent
on
a
judgment
about
federal
law,
and
that
judgment
is
incorrect,
it
is
not
an
independent
basis
for
decision
under
the
independent
adequacy
grounds.
mr.
jordan
steiker
that's
flowers.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
agree
with
that,
justice
souter.
i
think
that
to
apply
the
default
in
these
circumstances
where
everyone
was
plainly
aware
of
his
concerns
about
the
inadequacy
of
the
verdict
form
in
special...
and
the
special
issues,
would
be
imposing
too
high
and
too
excessively
burdensome
a
requirement
for
the
preservation
of
the
federal
right.
i
do
also
want
to
argue
that
there
is
a--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--well,
he
did--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--my
specific
point
is
once
he
has
made
it
plain...
and
this
is
all
that
texas
law
itself
says
is
required...
once
he
has
made
it
plain
that
he
objects
to
a
special
verdict
form
which
cannot
allow
for
the
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence,
and
this
court's
holding
is
that
that
is
precisely
the
error
in
this
case,
that
no
supplemental
nullification
instruction
could
correct,
he
has
plainly
made
clear
what
his
objection
was
and
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
do.
mr.
jordan
steiker
we
believe
it
is
the
latter.
that
we
are
assuming
that
harmless
error
analysis
could
apply
here
without
conceding
that
it's
necessarily
applied,
but
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
it
does
apply,
it
should
have
applied
the
chapman
standard,
which
is
their
standard
for
preserving--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--no.
it
would
be
under
brett.
it
would
be
a
different
standard.
but
texas
law
for
jury
instruction
claims
clearly
states
that
for
preserved
error,
the
standard
is
chapman.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think
that
the
cca's
position
and
respondent's
position
is
that
almanza
applies
dually
on
direct
review
and
post
conviction,
and
that
that's
that's
their
explanation
for
why
the
state
court
didn't
impose
a
procedural
default
on
state
habeas.
and
one
of
our
views
is
even
if
you
don't
agree
that
under
federal
law
this
objection
was
inadequate,
we
believe
that
the
state
could
not
in
effect
change
its
mind
about
the
adequacy
of
his
trial
objection
only
after
this
court
summarily
reversed
its
rule
on
the
merits.
and
we
think
there
are--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
think
it
is
changing
its
position.
when
four
judges
signal
that
this
may
be
a
procedural
impediment
in
the
case
and
the
court
declines
to
embrace
it,
i
think
that
is
a
signal
to
this
court
that--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
think
it
would
not
be
in
the
case
of
state
habeas,
for
this
reason.
the
vast
overwhelming
number
of
cases
that
proceed
into
state
habeas
are
on
their
way
when
they're
final
into
federal
habeas,
and
the
state
court
was
abandoning
this
argument
for
federal
habeas.
that
is,
it
was
removing
any
procedural
impediment
to
a
merits
review.
mr.
jordan
steiker
no,
i
do
not
make
that,
i
do
not
make
that
broad
argument,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
special
circumstances
of
state
habeas,
where,
as
this
court
knows,
99
percent
of
cases
are
on
their
way
to
federal
habeas,
and
the
state
does
not
adopt
this
procedural
impediment
which
would
from
a
judicial--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i'm
afraid
that's
not
my
experience
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
jordan
steiker
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
chief
justice
roberts,
the
courts
in
texas
take
that
approach,
which
is
if
there
is
a
procedural
impediment
to
the
case
they
flag
that
procedural
impediment,
rule
on
alternative
grounds,
and
i
think
that
is
good
evidence
that
in
this
case
when
four
justices
urged
a
procedural
element--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
mr.
jordan
steiker
we
don't
think
it's
a
difference,
your
honor,
because
we
think
the
underlying
fact,
the
adequacy
of
the
trial
objection,
was
what
obtained.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i
think
"waiver"
might
not
be
the
right
word.
mr.
jordan
steiker
but
it's
clear
that
if
the
state
court
does
not
rely
on
a
procedural
impediment
when
the
case
goes
into
federal
habeas
that
impediment
cannot
be
reintroduced
in
the
case
as
a
separate
ground
of
decision.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think
that
the
concerns
for
judicial
economy
in
this
case
would
have
dictated
that
if
the
state
court
believed
that
the
trial
objection
was
inadequate,
it
would
have
rested
its
decision
on
that
ground
to
essentially
preclude
merits
review
of
that
federal
constitutional
issue.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i
think
it's
a
special
risk
in
state
habeas
when
the--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--well,
we
would
take
the
cca
at
its
word
that
the
almanza
standard's
appropriate.
but
if
the
underlying
fact
of
the
adequacy
of
the
trial
objection
has
basically
been
accepted
by
the
state
court,
we
don't
believe
that
on
state
habeas
it
could
reintroduce
the
inadequacy
of
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
if
i
may
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jordan
steiker
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
record
in
this
case
because
i
think
once
it's
clarified
what
the
nature
of
the
evidence
was
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
this
court
could
find
that
the
error
was
harmful
under
any
standard,
including
the
egregious
harm
standard.
we
have
in
this
case
over
200
pages
of
exhibits
documenting
a
lifelong
disability.
this
evidence
was
first
introduced
in
the
guilt-innocence
phase
of
the
trial.
it
was
argued
at
the
guilt-innocence
closing
argument,
in
which
trial
counsel
said,
this
is
a
19-year-old
ninth
grader
who
has
been
charged
with
this
crime,
and
argued
that
that
was
the
basis
for
considering
him
less
culpable
than
his
college-educated
co-defendant.
during
the
punishment
phase,
it's
clear
that
the
single
most
important
witness,
the
one
whose
testimony
was
the
most
central,
the
most
time-consuming,
was
alberta
pingle,
who
brought
in
all
of
the
school
records
showing
from
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
in
school
he
had
been
diagnosed
as
a
learning
disabled,
possibly
organic
in
nature,
78
iq.
and
his
counsel
emphasized
this
as
the
central
basis
for
withholding
a
death
sentence.
he
said,
this
man
has
a
78
iq,
8
points
from
being
mentally
retarded,
lifelong
learning
disabilities,
possibly
organic
in
nature.
and
the
argument
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
abuse
in
this
case
is
belied
by
the
fact
that
the
evidence
showed
that
petitioner's
father
chased
him
with
a
butcher
knife
in
order
to
steel
the
family's
car
in
order
to
support
his
crack
habit.
if
that's
not
evidence
of
abuse
and
evidence
that
could
show
reduced
culpability
for
this
defendant,
coupled
especially
with
his
impairment
which
made
him
less
capable
of
responding
to
that
role
model
and
avoiding
dangerous
behavior--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--it
is
true
that
this
evidence
was
presented
as
only
one
page
of
his
closing
argument,
but
that
was
because
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
as
this
court
noted
in
its
summary
reversal,
the
prosecutor
got
up
right
before
defense
counsel
and
said:
you
promised
us
on
voir
dire
you
would
answer
the
special
issues
honestly
and
that
if
the
evidence
supported
a
yes
answer
to
deliberateness
and
dangerousness
you
would
give
us
yes
answers.
basically,
right
before
he
spoke
the
prosecutor
gave
an
anti-nullification
instruction
which
said
this
evidence
isn't
relevant
to
the
special
issues
of
deliberateness
and
dangerousness.
in
that
posture,
he
was
left
to
argue
that
the
evidence
showed
he
wasn't
dangerous,
that
the
evidence
showed
he
didn't
act
deliberately,
and
just
hope
that
the
jury
would
be
willing
to
lie
on
the
special
verdict
form.
mr.
jordan
steiker
his
argument--
mr.
jordan
steiker
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
mr.
jordan
steiker
no.
our
argument
is
that
when
you
take
out
the
clearly
impermissible
federal
conclusion
that
the
jury
could
give
effect
to
this
evidence,
which
was
exactly
what
this
court
said
to
the
contrary
in
its
summary
reversal...
this
court
said
this
evidence
couldn't
be
considered.
the
state
court
said
he
has
extensive
evidence,
he
has
powerful
evidence,
powerfully
presented,
dramatically
presented,
but
we
think,
unlike
the
supreme
court,
that
a
carefully
crafted
nullification
instruction
will
facilitate
the
jurors'
consideration
of
it.
so
if
you
take
away
the
impermissible
federal
conclusion,
this
court
could
clearly
conceive,
conclude,
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court's
own
characterization
of
this
evidence,
which
departs
tremendously
from
the
respondent's
view,
that
this
was
powerful
mitigating
evidence.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
error
was
to
conclude
that
this
could
be
taken
into
account
after
this
court
said
exactly
the
opposite.
thank
you,
your
honor.
