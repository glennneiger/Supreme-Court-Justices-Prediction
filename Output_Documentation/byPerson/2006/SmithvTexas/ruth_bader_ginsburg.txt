justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
judge,
the
judge,
i
thought,
told
the
lawyers
what
the
charge
would
be,
and
i
think
also
said
i
can't
give
a
separate
charge
on
mitigation
because
that's
a
job
that
only
the
texas
legislature
can
do.
i
am
bound
by
the
statute
to
give
these
two
things.
i
think
the
judge
said
that,
so
it
was
the
understanding
of
everyone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
otherwise
you
have
a
supreme
court
decision
that
the
state
court
can
say,
thanks,
thanks,
that's
very
interesting
advice,
but
we...
there
was
a
procedural
default
here.
although
we
bypassed
it
the
first
time,
we're
not
going
to
bypass
it
after
the
supreme
court
has
told
us
what
the
federal
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
cruz,
none
of
this
went
on
in
the
opinion
and
there
were
four
judges
of
that
court
who
said
there's
a
procedural
bar
here,
end
of
case.
the
majority
never
explained
why
they
weren't
going
along
with
that.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
the
majority
opinion
that
said,
well,
never
mind
that
there's
a
procedural
bar
here,
we're
going
to
deal
with
the
federal
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
instruction?
i
haven't
seen
one.
i
haven't
seen--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
your
instruction...
i
think
this
is
of
some
importance.
my
understanding
in
this
case
is
that
the
judge
as
well
as
counsel
thought
that
the
judge
couldn't
say
in
essence
what
became
the
texas
law
because
the
legislature
put
it
in,
which
is:
jury,
is
it
two
special
issues,
but
you
can
consider
all
the
mitigating
evidence
and
it's
up
to
you
if
you
think
that
mitigating
evidence
is
enough
to
have
a
life
rather
than
a
death
sentence.
that
i
thought
the
judge
couldn't
do.
i
have
not
seen
a
prelegislative
change,
charge
in
texas
that
says
what
the
legislature
provided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
jury,
what
they
take
into
the
jury
room
is
something
that
says
these
are
the
two
questions
that
you
must
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
tells
them
that
the
only
way
that
they
can
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence
is
if
they
answer
one
of
those
questions
falsely.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
cruz,
how
can
you
make
that
assumption
when
the
kind
of
mitigating
evidence
that
has
been
considered
possible
within
these
special
questions,
the...
the...
in
the
graham
case
where
the
reputation
of
this
young
man,
he
was
sweet,
gentle,
kind,
god
fearing,
and
so
the
murder
that
he
committed
was
an
aberration.
and
youth.
those
are
the
two
things
that
i
know
that
we
have
recognized
fall
within
that.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
surely
not
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
sweet
and
kind
person.
we
are
dealing
with
somebody
who
has
been
abused
as
a
child
and
who
has
a
mental
disorder.
