justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
steiker,
may
i
interrupt
you
or
interrupt
the
course
of
your
argument
to
get
to
a
more
preliminary
point
before
you
get
down
to
details?
do
you
concede
that
harmless
error
analysis
is
ever
appropriate,
is
ever
open
as
an
option
following
an,
in
effect,
a
finding
of
this
kind
of
instructional
error,
penry
i
instructional
error?
do
you
concede
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
quite
agree.
i
understand
that.
was
the,
was
the
issue
of
the
availability
of
harmless
error
raised
on
your
side
of
the
case
in
the
proceedings
back
in
texas?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i,
may
i
again
interrupt
you
to
just
get
the
context
of
your
argument?
you
said
earlier
that
under
chapman,
assuming
there
is
a
harmless
error
issue,
that
essentially
is...
is
necessarily
a
federal
issue.
and
therefore,
i
take
it,
the
basis
of
your
point
here
is,
if
that
is
a
federal
issue,
then
the
adequacy
of
actions
of
counsel
to
raise
it
is
also
a
federal
issue.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
my
understanding--
justice
david
h.
souter
--thank
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
do,
but
you
do
take
that
position
with
respect
to
a
harmless
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
we
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
there
is
disagreement
on
that
point,
are
there
any
cases
of
this
court
on
the
matter
of
adequacy
of
state
procedural
bars
that
would
support
you,
even
on
the
assumption
that
it's
a
state,
not
a
federal
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
case,
the
name
of
which
i
cannot
think
of,
to
the
effect
that
requiring
procedural
action
by
the
defendant
which
would
simply
be
a
useless
formality
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
flowers.
all
right.
wouldn't,
wouldn't
that
be
authority
that
you
would
invoke,
in
the,
in
the
sense,
as
i
understood
your
earlier
argument,
that
the,
that
the
pretrial
motion
and
the
adjudication
of
that
made
it
plain
to
everybody
what
the,
what
the
issue
was,
and
therefore
requiring
anything
more
would...
would
in
effect
violate
the
flowers
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
preserved
error
on
direct
review,
isn't
it?
on
page
23
of
their
brief
there's
a
footnote
that,
the
red
brief,
that
at
least
claims
to
describe
the
sort
of
the
structure
of
texas
law,
and
i
thought
under
texas
law
you
got
a
chapman
analysis
only
if
you
were
on
direct
review
and
had
preserved
error.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
be
a
special
risk
if
you,
if
you,
if
you
allowed
them
to
raise
the
bar,
allowed
a
state
to
raise
a
bar
to
consideration
of
the
issue.
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
you,
you
say
you
draw
no
distinction
between
the,
the
procedural
failing
as
a
bar
to
raising
the
issue
and
as
a
basis
for
determining
a
standard
of
harmless
error
review
later.
i
don't
understand
why
you,
you
can
maintain
there
is
no
distinction
because
if
they
may
not
consider
it
as
the
basis
for
their,
their
standard
of
harmless
error
review,
assuming
we
have
such
a
thing,
then
what
are
they
supposed
to
use
as
their
standard?
your
answer
i
take
it
is
chapman,
but
chapman
as
i
understand
the
statement
of
federal
law
would
not
apply...
state
law...
chapman
would
not
apply
in
these
circumstances.
and
if
you
were
in
a
federal
court
and
this
were
a
federal
conviction
chapman
wouldn't
apply
on
collateral
review.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
either
got
to
accept
the
distinction
between
procedural
error
as
bar
to
issue,
procedural
error
as
basis
for
standard
of
review,
or
you
have
no
way
to
figure
out
what
the,
what
the
standard
of
review
should
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
that
is
not
an
issue
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
penry
error,
even
if
not
structural,
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
review
and
you
could
say
that
that
distinction
is
possible
because
penry
has
a
built-in
harmless
error
or
a
harmful
error
component.
but
as
i
understand
it
that's
not...
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
isn't
the
implausibility
of
the
argument
that
you
are
making
something
like
this:
you
say
the
texas
rule
is
not
that
failure
to
object
is
a
procedural
bar
but
that
failure
to
object
determines
the
standard
of
harmless
error
review
if
in
fact
there
is
a
later
appeal.
the
implausibility,
though,
i
guess
of
the
position
is
that
as
i
understand
it,
four
members
of
the
texas
criminal
court
of
appeals
did
not
understand
that
to
be
the
case
at
all.
four
of
them
said
it
is
a
procedural
bar.
the
four
did
not
understand
that
there
was
this
rule
that
you
invoke,
and
when
the
four
said
there
is
a
procedural
bar,
the
majority
of
the
court
never
came
out
and
said
no,
there
isn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
consequence
of
that,
though,
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
there
was
no
clear
state
bar
at
the
time
in
question
and
therefore,
they
cannot
apply
it
now?
maybe
they
can
apply
it
in
cases
down
the
road.
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
can.
but
not
in
your
case,
because
the
bar
was
not
established
at
the
relevant
time
in
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
what
it
is
doing
is
in
effect
saying
there
was
a
kind
of
default
which
is
subsumed
in
what
the
four
dissenting
justices
said
the
first
time
around.
and
so
we're
going
to,
we're
going
to
sort
of
call
it
a
half-loaf
procedural
default,
but
we
never
said
so
the
first
time
around.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
understand
that
they
would
be
separate
concepts
if
there
were
a
rule
or
if
there
had
been
a
rule
in
place
at
the
time
he
was
going
through
his
state
habeas
that
so
said.
but
we
don't
seem
to
have
such
a
rule
because
as
you
said,
there
was
disagreement
within
the
court,
and
hood
had
not
been
decided,
and
therefore--
justice
david
h.
souter
--pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
black
being...
help
me
out,
black?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
goes
to
penry
i,
and
this
is
then
an
objection
both
to
penry
i
and
based
on
penry
ii.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
90
percent,
you're
talking
about
argument
time,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
answer
to
that
is,
there
were
several
hundred
pages
of
records
from
school
and
the
testing
that
went
on
in
school
that
indicated
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
with
this
guy.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
maybe...
but
the
fact
is
that
we're
talking
right
now
about
sort
of
quantum
of
evidence.
was
there
something
serious
there
for
the
jury
to
consider
which
in
effect
is
the
basis
for
all
of
this
argument?
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
fairly
characterized
by
saying,
well,
percent
of
the
mitigation
case
was
that
he
was
sweet
and
loving
there.
whether
you
find
it...
whether
you
find
it
persuasive
or
not,
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
of...
going
to
his
mental
capacity
and
to
his
abuse.
