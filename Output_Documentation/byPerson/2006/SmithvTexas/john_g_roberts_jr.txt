chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
05-11304,
smith
versus
texas.
mr.
steiker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
that
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
analysis
is
a
question
of
state
law,
though,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
applied,
they
applied
a
legal
standard,
the
egregious
harm
standard,
that
depends
on
failure
of
an
objection.
so
i
would
have
thought
they,
they
certainly
thought
that
there
was
an
inadequate
objection,
or
they
wouldn't
have
applied
that
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that...
just,
why
is
that
too
burdensome?
what's
so
burdensome
about
saying
i
object
to
that
instruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
saying,
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
it
would
have
been
futile
and
saying
it's
high
and
burdensome,
and
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
specific
point
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
didn't
have
to
reach
the
harmless
error
question
after
it
made
an
erroneous
determination
that
there
was
no
error
at
all.
when
the
case
came
up
here
and
the
court
determined
there
was
error,
then
it
was
necessary
to
reach
it.
i
don't
see
that
it's
changing
its
position
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
it
be
normal
exercise
of
judicial
restraint
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
reach
out
and
decide
whether
this
error
was
harmless
if
we've
already
decided
there's
no
error
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it's
a
very
bad...
i
think
in
the
long
term
in
the
broad
category
of
cases,
it
would
be
a
very
bad
solution
for
defendants,
because
what's
going
to
happen,
once
a
court's
determined
there's
no
error
at
all,
it's
much
easier
for
them
to
say,
oh
and
by
the
way
if
there
was
it's
harmless.
and
if
they
did
that
and
then
it
turns
out
there
was
an
error,
you're
going
to
be
back
here
saying,
well,
don't
be
bound
by
their
harmless
error
decision
because
they
thought
there
was
no
error
at
all,
so
they
didn't
focus
on
it
carefully.
i
would
say
the
way
they
approached
it
in
this
case
is
the
more
desirable
way.
if
you
don't
think
there's
an
error
don't
go
on
and
decide
whether
it's
harmless
or
not
in
the
abstract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
even
if
it
is,
logically
anterior
to
consideration
of
that
procedural
impediment
is
a
particular
ruling
on
the
merits
and
the
state
court
didn't
make
that
merits.
they
thought
there
was
no
error.
it
is
logically
not
necessary
for
them
to
decide
whether
an
error
is
harmless
if
they
don't
think
there's
an
error,
and
to
say
that
they
waive
that,
that
later
ground
i
would
have
thought
would
be
very
surprising.
why
do
we
remand
these
cases
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion
if
there's
nothing
further
to
be
considered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cruz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
simple
question
is
the
procedural
objection,
as
the
four
judges
suggested,
could
have
precluded
consideration--
of
the
federal
claim
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
court
said
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
consider
it,
and
then
when
it
turns
out
that
they
got
it
wrong
and
there
was
error
they
had
to
apply
harmless
error
review.
in
texas
law,
harmless
error
review
turns
on
the
standard
whether
there
was
an
objection
or
not,
and
they
went
back
and
said
there
was
no
objection.
the
contrary
assertions
assumes
that
when
they
let
the
claim
go
forward,
that
they
were
waiving
any
reliance
on
objection
for
any
purposes,
not
consideration
on
the
merits,
but
also
for
any
eventual
later
consideration
on
harmless
error
pursuant
to
the
established
state
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
schaerr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
plain
error,
as
applied
in
the
federal
cases
under
alano.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
steiker,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
general,
mr.
cruz's
comments
that
this
was
a
minor
point
in
counsel's
summation
before
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
argument
an
assertion
that
the
texas
state
court
was
wrong
in
its
determination
of
this
question
of
texas
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
argument
right
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
argument
an
argument
that
the
texas
state
court
was
wrong
on
its
ruling
under
texas
state
law
harmless
error.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
05-11304
smith
versus
texas.
