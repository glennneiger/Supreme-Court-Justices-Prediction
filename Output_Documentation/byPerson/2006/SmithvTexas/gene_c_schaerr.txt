mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
california
and
20
other
states
who
are
concerned
about
the
implications
of
petitioner's
arguments
for
their
ability
to
apply
their
own
varied
harmless
error
standards
in
their
own
state
habeas
proceedings,
and
thereby
to
strike
what
they
believe
to
be
the
right
balance
between
the
two
competing
concerns
that
this
court
identified
in
calderon.
one
being
the
significant
social
costs
of
retrial
or
resentencing,
and
the
other
the
desire
to
ensure
that
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
is
available
to
those
whom
society
has
grievously
wronged.
and
with
those
concerns
in
mind,
i'd
like
to
address
three
specific
points.
the
first
is
the
whole
question
of
whether
states
have
the
ability
under
our
federal
constitution
to
choose
their
own
harmless
error
standards
even
when
they
are
addressing
federal
error.
petitioner
appears
to
concede
as
a
general
matter
that
states
do
have
that
authority,
but
let
me
just
briefly
indicate
why
that
concession
is
well
founded.
first
of
all,
as
this
court
has
held
in
pennsylvania
versus
finley--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i'm
just
talking
about
collateral
review
right
now.
as
this
court
has
held
in
pennsylvania
versus
finley,
the
states
are
under
no
obligation
to
provide
collateral
review
at
all,
and
so
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
they
take
the
step
of
deciding
that
they
will
provide
such
review,
for
this
court
to
say,
well,
if
you're
going
to
do
that
you
have
to
apply
a
federal
standard
on
state
habeas
review
rather
than
the
standard
that
you
choose.
secondly,
to
the
extent
the
states
decide
to
provide
habeas
review
or
any
other
kind
of
post-conviction
review,
the
authority
by
which
they
do
that
derives
from
state
law,
not
from
the
federal
constitution
or
any
other
federal
law,
and
this
court
obviously
does
not
have
general
supervisory
authority
over,
over
state
courts
as
it
does
federal
courts.
and
third,
unlike
the
situation
with
direct
review,
this
court
could
not
as
a
practical
matter
impose
a
federal
standard
on
state
habeas
proceedings
without
being
highly
intrusive.
i
mean--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i'm
not
aware
that
the
court
has
expressly
addressed
that
precise
question,
which
i
think
is--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--yes.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
our
amicus
brief,
your
honor,
cites,
cites
dozens
of
cases
in
which,
in
which
states
have
addressed
federal--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i'm
sure
it
does.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
state
is
free
in
that
circumstance
to
apply
a
state
harmless
error
standard
or
if
it
has
to
be
required
to
apply
a
federal
harmless
error
standard.
and
our...
and
the
fact
is
that
on
the
ground
the
states
are
routinely
applying
state
harmless
error
standards
in
those
situations.
and
so
it
would
be
a
sea
change
if
this
court
were
to
now
hold
that,
no,
when
a
state
court
is
reviewing
the
effect
of
a
federal
error
that
the
state
court
has
to
apply
a
federal
standard
rather
than
the
state.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
think
it's
the
alano
standard,
at
least
in
the
federal--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--no,
no.
there
isn't.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
why
i'm
here,
that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
then
the
question
would
be
is
there
some
federal
law
reason
why
they
have
to.
i
mean,
they
may
under
state
law
have
to
apply
them--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--there
may
be
under
state
law,
it's
not
clear
why
that
would
raise
a
federal
issue.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
there
may
be
a
due
process
objection
to
that,
but
here
the
only
objection--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
that
may
be
one
reason
why
we
have
federal
habeas
proceedings.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
correct.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
that's,
that's
exactly
right
and
especially
in
the
habeas
context
it
would
be,
it
would
be
extremely
intrusive
and
invasive
for
this
court
to
attempt
to
do
that.
it's
one
thing
on
direct
review
of
a
state
criminal
conviction
to
say
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
we
think
there
was
an
error
here
and
we're
going
to
nullify
the
conviction,
which
is
what
the
constitution
gives
this
court
the
power
to
do.
but
it's
quite
another,
after
the
conviction
is
final
and
the
defendant
is
already
incarcerated,
then
on
a
state
habeas
proceeding
for
the
issue
to
come,
to
come
back
to
this
court,
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
this
court
to
say,
well,
you
have
to
apply
federal
standards
or
federally
dictated
procedures
in
that
circumstance.
thank
you.
