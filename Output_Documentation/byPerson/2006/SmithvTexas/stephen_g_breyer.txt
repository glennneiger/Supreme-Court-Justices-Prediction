justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
going
to
hear
in
a
second,
i'm
sure,
because
i
read
it
in
the
briefs,
my
understanding
of
the
texas
point
is
slightly
different.
it
is
this.
that
under
texas
law,
when
you
file
before
the,
before
the
trial,
a
general
objection,
unless
you
make
the
objection
again
when
the
specific,
when
a
specific
instruction
is
given,
you've
forfeited
your
rights
to
appeal.
under
texas
law.
and
they
say
that's
true
of
evidence
and
that's
true
here,
too.
and
they
say
that's
just
texas
law,
ordinary
texas
law.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
you
did,
you
didn't
make
the
right
objection.
now
you
come
up
here
and
well,
you
are
out.
you
can't
make
any
argument.
but...
we
are
very
generous,
and
we
will
let
even
people
who
make
every
wrong
procedural
thing
still
have
a
shot,
if
what
they
have,
if
what
they
are
pointing
to
absolutely
egregious.
but
your
isn't
absolutely
egregious
so
you're
in
the
same
boat
as
if
you
just
didn't
have
any
argument
because
you
didn't
follow
the
texas
law.
now,
i
take
it,
that's
their
point.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
you're
there
in
a
texas
court.
we're
not.
we
are
following
texas
law,
they
say,
and
you're
wrong.
now,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
why,
why
do
you
say
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
it
doesn't
matter?
i
would
have
thought
every
case
it
mattered.
look,
isn't
it
an
absolute
rule
that
there's
a
federal
issue
in
a
case
and
there's
a
state
ground,
the
state
ground
typically
is
a
failure
to
raise
an
objection,
and
a
state
court
says
the
federal
ground
is
what
we're
talking
about.
they
say
nothing
about
the
state
ground
and
they
decide
the
federal
ground.
the
defendant
goes
to
a
federal
court
and
he
says,
i'm
entitled
to
be
released
because
they
got
the
federal
ground
wrong.
i
thought
it's
a
hundred
percent
the
case,
and
this
is
where
you'll
correct
me,
that
it's
now
too
late
for
the
state
to
raise
the
state
ground
but
the
state's
waived
their
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
and
that
if
they
try
to
raise
it
again
the
answer
is
always,
not
some
of
the
time:
i'm
very
sorry,
state;
you're
out
of
luck;
you
should
have
decided
it
on
the
state
ground
and
not
reached
the
federal
ground.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
case?
suppose
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
the
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
question
of
waiver,
part
of
it.
i
mean,
that's...
it's
well
established
that,
i
guess,
i
mean,
if
a
state
waives
an
adequate
state
ground
by
considering
the
federal
issue,
the
federal
courts
will
go
into
the
federal
ground
and
they
can't
later,
can
they...
is
there
any
case
you
found
anywhere...
i
haven't
found
one...
where
say
any
federal
court
considered
a
state
case
where
the
state
went
into
the
federal
issue,
the
state
had
said
nothing
about
a
state
ground,
and
then
after
the
federal
court's
decided
it
somehow
the
state
got
a
hold
of
it
again
and
they
this
time
said,
oh
dear,
we
forgot,
we
forgot;
in
fact,
there
is
the
state
ground
here.
and
is
there
any
case
that
you
found
like
that
which
says
that
was
permissible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
there's
no
such
case
and
therefore
this
would
be
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
i'm
saying
the
state
typically
decides
against
the
defendant.
they
decide
against
the
defendant
on
a
federal
issue.
there's
a
perfectly
adequate
state
issue.
it's
called
failure
to
object,
and
they
don't
mention
it.
i'd
be
repeating
myself.
are
you
following
what
my,
my...
and
i'm
saying
is
there
any
case
you
found
anywhere
which
says
after
that
occurred
that
the
state
when
it
gets
a
hold
of
the
case
again
can
say,
oh
dear,
we
forgot,
there's
also
this
adequate
state
ground,
bad
luck?
i've
never
seen
such
a
thing.
i
doubt
that
you
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
say
this
would
be
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
making
a
mistake
here.
i
thought
that
the
reason
they
bring
in
the
almanza
standard
is,
as
i
put
it
before,
a
kind
of
act
of
charity.
that
is,
since
there
was
no
contemporaneous
objection
or
proper
one,
you
don't
get
any
appeal
normally.
but
we'll
let
you
do
it
if
you
can
show
egregious
harm.
i'm
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
speaking
of
that
case,
can
you
give
me
any
citation?
and
just
give
me
a
citation,
and
here
there
may
not
be
one,
but
you
give
me
a
citation
where
texas
previously
said
that
a
defendant
who
raised
an
objection
before
trial
to
the
application
of
the
statute
to
his
client,
he
said
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
my
client,
give
me
one
example
in
texas
law
where
that
was
raised
and
the
state
appeals
court
of
any...
at
any
level
said,
i'm
very
sorry,
you
can't
really
appeal
that
because
you
should
have
said
it
again
during
the
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
there's
no
case,
there's
no
case
in
texas
law
which
says
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
because
he
didn't
raise
it
again
in
the
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in,
in
this
case
suppose
the
following
circumstance.
suppose
a
federal
court
has
decided
in
the
case
of
this
defendant--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
was
an
error
of
federal
constitutional
law,
search
and
seizure
or
confessions
or
something,
and
now
we
send
it
back.
and
let's
suppose
further
the
state
has
no
independent
state
ground,
they
are
not
trying
to
make
the
argument,
whether
or
not
they're
trying
to
make
it
here.
there's
no
independent
state
ground,
no
objection
to
problem,
nothing.
now,
i
read
that
one
standard
that
could
be
applied
is
the
structural
error
standard.
a
second
is
a
harmless
error
standard.
but
i've
never
seen
a
case,
but
that's
perhaps
my
ignorance...
that's
whey
want
you
to
show
me...
where
it's
definitively
established
by
a
federal
court
anyway
that
there
was
a
serious
federal
error,
i've
never
seen
a
case
where
this
court
said,
or
i
can't
recall
one,
that
the
state
applied
yet
some
third
kind
of
standard,
such
as,
well,
i
know
there
was
a
very
important
error,
i
know
it
was
federal
and
constitutional,
but
nonetheless
we're
not
going
to
give
them
any
remedy
unless
it's
absolutely
egregious
harm.
i've
never
seen
that
in
the
law.
now,
can
you
point
to
me
in
the
law
where,
which
will
correct
my
lacuna?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
seen
it
in
a
state?
have
you
ever
seen
a
state
which
gets
a
case
back
from--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where?
where
should
i
look
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
that
because
obviously
they
can
do
what
they
want,
i
think,
in
the
state
courts,
but
they
might
violate
federal
law
if
they
do
it.
and
now
so
what's
happened
is
somebody
has
gone
into
federal
court
or
this
court
and
federal
court
or
this
court
has
said:
here's
a
federal
error,
of
course
you're
free
to
apply
harmless
error
or
whatever,
you
don't
have
to
let
the
person
have
a
new
trial
or
let
him
out.
but
i've
never
seen
an
instance
i
can
think
of
where,
that
having
happened,
the
state
then
applied
yet
some
third
standard
like
absolutely
egregious
horrible
harm
or
not
totally
wonderful
harm
or
something
like
that.
i've
never
seen.
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
is
there
such
an
instance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
the
reason
would
be
that
there
is
a
problem
with
enforcing
federal
constitutional
standards.
i
have
not
heard
of
a
state
that
says,
suppose
the
jury
was
chosen
in
a
racially
discriminatory
way,
suppose
there
are
all
kinds
of
things,
the
state
says,
well,
we
admit,
we
admit
that
there
is
this
violation,
but
we're
just
not
going
to
apply
a
harmless
error
standard.
we're
going
to
apply
a
tough
one.
i
guess
that
would
be
the
reason.
that's
why
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
it.
