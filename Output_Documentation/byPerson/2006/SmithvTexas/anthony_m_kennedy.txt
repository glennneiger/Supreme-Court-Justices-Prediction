anthony
m.
kennedy
also
on
the
same
preliminary
line
of
inquiry,
are
we
in
as
good
a
position
as
the
state
court
to
conduct
harmless
error
analysis,
or
can
we
or
must
we
defer
to
the
state
court's
harmless
error
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
there
is
an
instruction
given
to
the
jury
and
it
violates
the
constitution,
then
we,
as
a
de
novo
matter,
can
determine
the
harmless
error,
harmless
error
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
level
of
harmless
error
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
or
state
law
when
there
is
a
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really.
you
mean
that
they
could
have
something
that
it
has
to
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
we'd
be
bound
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
but
in
this
case
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
did
one
other
thing,
and
it
said
to
the
judge,
you
don't
have
authority
under
state
law
to
add
to
these
supplemental
instructions.
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
he
was
right
about
that,
wasn't
he?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
the
nullification
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
this
case
the
judge
said
i'm
going
to
give
the
nullification
instruction,
and
the
attorney
said,
and
i
think
quite
properly,
he
said
that
won't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
no
federal
interest
in
ensuring
that
there
is
a
full
and
fair
implementation
of
a
federal
right?
and
if
the
state
higher
standard
is
erroneously
applied,
doesn't
that
prejudice
the
federal
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
petitioner
here
is
under
a
death
sentence.
his
case
came
to
us
for
a
second
time
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
because
of
the
multiple
proceedings
it's
necessary
to
explain
the
procedural
history
of
the
case.
the
question
before
us
here
the
first
time
was
the
constitutionality
of
his
death
sentence
now
we
are
asked
whether
the
disposition
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
remand
was
consistent
with
our
first
decision,
we
hold
it
was
not
and
therefore
we
reversed
the
state
court
once
again.
in
1991,
laroyce
smith
committed
a
brutal
murder
and
for
which
he
was
convicted.
his
trial
and
sentencing
took
place
in
the
interim
between
this
court’s
decisions
in
penry
versus
lynaugh
which
is
called
penry
i
for
convenience
and
penry
versus
johnson
which
is
called
penry
ii.
in
penry
i,
the
court
considered
the
so
called
special
issue
question
texas
gave
to
the
jury
to
guide
it's
discretion
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
the
first
special
issue
ask
whether
the
conduct
was
deliberate,
the
second
ask
whether
the
defendant
pose
a
threat
of
future
danger.
if
the
jury
answered
yes
to
both
questions,
the
death
penalty
would
be
imposed.
this
court
decided
the
special
issues
did
not
let
jurors
give
meaningful
effect
to
some
forms
of
mitigating
evidence
that
defendant
might
offer.
after
that
decision,
texas
court
attempted
to
cure
the
problem
which
we
will
call
the
penry
error
by
giving
the
juries
a
nullification
charge.
the
nullification
charge
told
the
jury
that
even
if
they
felt
the
special
issues
were
true,
if
they
nevertheless
felt
that
the
death
penalty
in
appropriate,
they
should
falsely
answer
no
to
one
of
the
two
questions,
and
that
would
prevent
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
before
trial
smith
filed
motions
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
special
issues
that’s
in
his
trial,
he
argued
that
the
special
issues
would
not
give
the
jury
an
adequate
means
of
considering
some
of
his
mitigating
evidence.
the
trial
court
rejected
these
motions
but
it
told
smith
that
would
issue
a
nullification
charge.
smith
did
not
object
to
the
nullification
charge,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
after
his
trial
he
continued
to
challenge
the
special
issues
on
appeal,
he
did
not
succeed.
after
that
dismissal
this
court
decided
penry
ii,
in
penry
ii
the
court
held
that
a
nullification
charge
is
not
cure
to
penry
error
because
asking
jurors
to
fill
out
the
verdict
form
in
a
false
way,
places
them
in
a
moral,
ethical
and
legal
bind.
because
penry
ii
provided
smith
new
legal
support
for
his
position,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
agreed
to
decide
habeas
petition
on
the
merits
but
the
state
court
then
denied
it.
in
the
first
case
here,
first
time
he
came
here,
smith
i,
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
by
summary
disposition.
this
court
first
held
that
smith
had
proffered
relevant
mitigating
evidence
unrelated
to
the
special
issues
and
then
concluded
that
the
nullification
charge
like
the
charge
in
penry
ii,
did
not
cure
the
penry
error.
on
remand
from
our
first
decision,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
for
the
first
time
the
smith
had
failed
to
preserve
the
claim
in
which
he
sought
relief.
namely
error
regarding
the
nullification
charge,
therefore
under
the
state
courts
holding
following
as
texas
state
case
called
almanza.
smith
would
need
to
show
egregious
error,
not
just
some
harm
due
to
the
alleged
and
preserved
error,
he
had
not
done
so
the
state
court
said
and
so
he
was
not
entitled
to
relief.
now
that’s
the
state
court
decision
that’s
now
on
review
again
in
this
case.
absent
some
important
exceptions,
this
court
will
not
overturn
a
state
court
judgment
that
rests
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
procedural
rule.
even
if
the
rules
prevents
the
vindication
of
the
federal
right,
it
is
well
established
however,
that
it
is
wholly
appropriate
to
correct
a
misunderstanding
of
federal
law
that
serves
as
the
predicate
for
erroneous
application
of
a
state
bar
and
in
this
case
there
was
an
error
of
that
sort.
the
grounds
for
relief
in
smith
i
as
in
penry
ii
was
that
the
special
issues
did
not
let
the
jury
do
what
was
obligated
to
do,
give
meaningful
consideration
to
all
of
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence
offered
by
the
defendant.
that
is
the
claim
smith
made
before
trial
which
he
pursued
on
appeal
and
it
stayed
habeas
course
and
which
he
presented
to
this
court
in
smith
i
the
first
time
we
heard
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
heightened
almanza
standard
not
because
the
challenge
to
the
special
issues
was
unpreserved
but
because
of
they
thought
smith
was
bringing
a
different
a
sort
of
claim
directed
specifically
to
the
nullification
charge
that
was
not
the
claim
on
which
we
granted
relief
in
smith
i.
under
the
state’s
rule
in
almanza
a
state
habeas
petitioner
need
only
show
some
harm
if
he
has
preserved
his
claim.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
elsewhere
that
some
harm
is
showing
when
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
the
jury
interpreted
the
instructions
in
a
way
that
precluded
consideration
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
because
the
finding
of
penry
error
is
a
finding
of
that
reasonable
likelihood
and
because
the
texas
court
must
defer
to
our
interpretation
of
federal
law
it
appears
smith
would
be
able
to
satisfy
the
lower
standard
on
his
challenge
to
the
special
issues,
so
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
