stephen
g.
breyer
don't
you
agree
with
justice
scalia...
justice
alito?
don't
you
agree
with
justice
alito?
i
thought
he's
saying
it's
a
ruling
on
constitutionality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
he
do?
i
mean
i
looked
at
what
he
does
in
74,
75,
76a.
he
seems
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
moving
furniture.
he
lists
that
twice.
he
runs
the
office.
and
he
represents,
he
is
out
in
the
local
office
somewhere
and
he
talks
to
constituents.
i
mean,
he
doesn't
even
appear
in
the
senate
office
except
very
rarely
in
which
case
he
is
doing
casework.
so
i
guess
if
he
is
included
in
that,
i
mean
so
is
a
full-time
furniture
mover.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
the
whole
list
here.
what
here
suggests,
he
ever...
he
doesn't
even
write
a
statement
for
the
floor.
there
is
nothing
here
that
suggests
one
word
of
anything
he
did
ever
went
to
a
committee
meeting,
to
a
floor
of
the
senate,
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
that
one.
i
just
said
he
doesn't
do
anything
that
gets
to
the
floor
of
the
senate,
that
gets
to
a
committee
report,
that
gets
to
a
committee
hearing.
now
what
in
there...
and
you
said
it
was
not
contested,
so
i
guess
the
best
source
if
it's
not
contested
is
his
affidavit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
where
does
it
say
that?
he
drafted
legislation
that
was
then
introduced?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
wrong
with
this?
i
found
what
you're
talking
about
here.
it
says
in
paragraph
13,
contrary
to
what
he
says
in
his
own
evaluation,
that
senator
dayton's
staff,
including
mr.
hanson...
that's
a
little
uncertain,
what
they
mean
by
that...
introduced
a
bill
and
drafted
it.
okay?
and
then
on
paragraph
14
they
say
on
november
15th,
2001,
mr.
hanson...
just
as
you
said...
planned
a
senate
government
affairs
committee
meeting,
selected
hearing
witnesses
and
prepared
questions.
now
suppose
that
we
did
as
the
court,
lower
court
wanted
to
do,
say
let's
just
see
if
that
becomes
relevant.
because
it's
possible,
given
his
other
tasks
that
those
two
incidents,
one
on
november
15th
and
the
other,
whenever
help
he
gave
to
the
drafting,
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
being
fired
and
nobody
claims
that.
so
what
they
said
is
let's
wait
and
see
if
that
becomes
relevant.
now
what's
wrong
with
that
solution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
make
an
absurd
case
out
of
it
which
i'm
trying
to
do
a
little
bit
to
get
you
to
focus
on
it.
let's
suppose
he
got
fired
because
he
didn't
move
the
furniture
properly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
could
or
couldn't
be.
i
mean,
i
mean
if
the
legislator,
the
senator,
says,
i
think
relevant
to
my
dismissal
of
this
individual
is
the
individual's
performance
that
revealed
itself
in
a
speech
or
debate
that
i
gave
in
the
house,
and
if
that's
relevant,
then
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case,
they
can't
bring
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
he'd
have
to
say
is
it's
relevant
to
my
decision
to
fire
the
person.
now,
surely
a
jury
or
whoever...
it's
probably
a
jury
matter,
i
guess,
on
this...
is
entitled
to
take
that
into
account.
if
it's
something
the
jury
is
entitled
to
take
into
account,
you
are
questioning
what
that
senator
did
in
the
speech
or
debate
and
you
are
questioning
it
in
another
place,
namely,
a
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
go
back
a
step.
i
just...
you
said
this
is
appealable
and
your
reason
for
it
being
appealable
was
because
the
statute
itself...
you
said
it
was
not
appealable
and
the
reason
not
is
because
the
statute
itself
said
that
this
has
to
be
applied
consistent
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
reason.
so
i
take
it,
what
about
the
reason
that's
been
given,
that
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge
instead
of
on
its
face?
what
about
that
as
a
reason
for
it
not
being
appealable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
i'm
not
asking
about
the
argument
you
are
making.
i
want
to
ask
about
an
argument
you
aren't
making,
that
the
reason...
i'll
ask
about
the
one
you
are
making
in
a
second.
the
reason
i
want
to
know
about...
i
want
to
know
about
the
other
possible
reason
for
not
being
appealed,
namely
that
this
is
as
applied
and
not
on
its
face.
they
don't
strike
down
any
provision.
what's
your
view
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
correct.
and
what
you
do
about
this
case,
what
is
it,
eichman?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
a
holding
of
a
district
court
in
your
opinion,
the
holdings
say,
imaginary,
is
that
no
one
who
actually
works
in
an
office
of
a
senator
and
who
ever
worked
on
any
matter
having
to
do
with
legislation
falls
within
this
act
because
that
would
violate
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
that
would
be
quite
major
in
its
implication.
but
you're
saying
there
is
no
appeal
on
that
because
it's
as
applied.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
if
i
go
to
your
argument...
i
mean,
the
problem
with
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
is
that
that
leaves
no
room
for
this
appellate
provision
at
law,
because
the
only
reason
that
anything
is
likely
to
be
unconstitutional
in
this
area,
at
least
99
percent
of
it,
would
be
speech
or
debate
clause
violation.
so
in
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
there
is
no
direct
appeal,
or
hardly
ever.
