justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
the
statute
says,
and
so
how
could
the
statute
possibly
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
constitution...
i
mean,
the
statute
has
within
itself
a
speech
or
debate
clause
exception.
now,
i
guess
you
can
argue
that
a
lower
court
might
not
accurately
provide
the
speech
or
debate
clause
protection
that
is
due,
but
that,
that
doesn't
meet,
it
seems
to
me,
the,
the
jurisdictional
requirement
that,
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
be
called
into
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
comply
with
section
412,
which
says
that
an
appeal
may
be
taken
directly
to
the
supreme
court
from
"any
interlocutory
or
final
judgment
decree
of
order
of
court
upon
the
constitutionality
of
any
provision
of
the
act.
"
now,
and
as-applied
challenge
is
not
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
problem
is,
it's
extraordinary.
we
have
very
few
direct
appeal
cases
any
more
and
i,
i
am
loathe
to
read
section
412
as
embracing
a
decision
by
a
court
that
a
particular
use
of
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
you
say
it
was,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
applied.
that's
sloppy
language.
it
really
means
that
this
application
of
the
statute
or
the
use
of
the
statute
for
this
purpose
was
unconstitutional.
i
think
that's
something
different
from
saying
that
it
was
an
order
of
the
court
upon
the
constitutionality
of
any
provision.
which
provision
of
this
act
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
which...
but
it
hasn't
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
it's
perfectly
constitutional.
you're
just
saying
it
can't
be
used
in
this
particular
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
read
the
language.
it
says
"the
constitutionality
of
any
provision
of
this
act.
"
not
"the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
any
provision
of
this
act.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
had
the
lower
court
held?
it
isn't
a
question
of
what
we
held;
it's
a
question
of
what
the
lower
court
had
held.
had
the
lower
court
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
but
that
can
mean...
you
can
always
dispose
of
a,
of
a
facial
challenge
by
just
saying
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
facial
question;
we
can
decide
it
on
an
as
applied
question.
but
in
order
to
get
here
in
the
first
place,
it
has
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
didn't
do
exclusively
that
stuff
anyway.
we
can
certainly
all
agree
on
that.
and
why
isn't
it
sufficient
that
when
any
of
those
issues
are,
his
activities
in
any
of
those
capacities
are
sought
to
be
introduced
into
evidence,
anyone
tries
to
contradict
them,
then
you
can
bring
in
your
speech
or
debate
clause
objection?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
whole
suit
precluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
he
was
the
23rd
self.
[laughter]
i
think
you
have
to
figure
out
when
he
was
hired.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
never
an
office.
i
mean,
i
think
the
office
is
just
a
fictional
construct
anyway.
so
what
you
say
now
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether,
whether
this
current
senator
has,
has
departed
from
the
scene.
even
if
he
were
still
on
the
scene,
there
still
wouldn't
be
any
such
thing
as
that
office.
it's
just
a
fiction,
and
it
would
always
be
a
suit
against
congress,
and
so
you
say
none
of
these
suits
can
ever
be
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
when
you
set
up
a
system
that
envisions
a
suit
which
will
be
paid
off
by
the
senate?
why
isn't
that
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
physical,
a
physical
office,
yes.
i
mean,
they
didn't
work
in
the
hallway.
but
their
staff
salary
was
not
paid
out
of
their,
quote,
"office".
it
was
paid
out
of
the
senate.
justice
antonin
scalia
setting
it
is
quite
different
from
paying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
senator
sets
it
and
the
senate
pays
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
the
senate
puts
a
limit
on
how
much
money
it
will
spend
for
a
particular
senator.
that's
all
that
amounts
to.
it
doesn't
hand
him
the
money.
it's
still
the
senate's
money,
isn't
it?
and
what
the
senate
says
is
each
office
will
have
so
much
of
a
call
upon
our
fund
and
no
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side's
contention
is
that
the
firing
is
itself
a
legislative
act
and
so
when
you
challenge
the
firing
you
are
challenging
the
legislative
act.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
matter
anyway,
because
our
prior
decisions
that
do
not
explicitly
refer
to
jurisdictional
questions
are
not
authority
on
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
that
firm
rule:
when
we
take
a
case
and
don't
get
into
the
jurisdictional
question,
it
is
not
precedent
for
the
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
that,
that
may
make
sense.
i,
i
wondered
why...
why
they
would
provide
for
an
appeal
on
constitutionality
if
they
had
in
mind
the
speech
or
debate
clause
stuff,
when
the
legislation
itself
says
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
deemed
a
violation
of
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
