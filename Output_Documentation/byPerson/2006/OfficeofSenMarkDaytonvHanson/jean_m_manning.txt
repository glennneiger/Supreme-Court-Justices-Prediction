ms.
jean
m.
manning
justice
stevens
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
quickly
frame
the
merits
of
the
case
and
then
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
in
united
states
vs.
gravel
this
court
recognized
that
members
of
congress
have
to
delegate
some
of
their
legislative
authority
to
employees
and
these
employees
are
a
second
self
to
the
member.
they
are
performing
some
of
the
legislative
duties
the
member
himself
would
otherwise
perform.
therefore,
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
legislative
process
of
the
member's
office.
for
that
reason,
the
member
must
have
absolute
trust
and
confidence
that
these
employees
are
in
fact
performing
as
his
second
self,
and
to
do
that
the
member
has
to
have
complete
discretion
in
selecting
who
these
employees
are
and
in
managing
them.
if
a
court
oversees
a
member's
selection
of
these
employees
and
his
management
of
these
employees,
then
the
court
and
not
the
member
is
managing
part
of
his
legislative
process
and
that
is
a
violation
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
because
the
purpose
of
the
clause
is
to
ensure
that
the
legislative
process
will
be
performed
independently.
now--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--i
do
not,
justice
ginsburg.
this
court
has
never
deferred
to
congress
with
respect
to
its
interpretation
and
in
fact
has
disagreed
with
congress,
for
example,
in
the
gravel
case.
but
the
other
reason
is
that
the
congress
of
course
is
a
political
body
and
because
of
that
it
will
make
decisions
that
are
politically
expedient
at
times,
which
means
that
over
time
their
decisions
can
change,
while
the
court
is
uniquely
designed
and
intended
to
decide
cases
on
something
other
than
what
is
politically
expedient.
this
is
especially
important
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
constitution
and
interpreting
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
it
did,
justice
ginsburg,
subject
itself,
but
it
also
in
section
413
recognized
that
there
may
be
speech
or
debate
clause
issues
and
maybe
not
all
of
these
cases
can
be
adjudicated
in
a
court.
not
that
they
can't
be
adjudicated,
but
maybe
not
in
a
court.
so
while
subjecting
itself
to
the
law
and
doing
the
best
it
could
to
do
that,
it
also
cannot
trump
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
we
are
not--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--well,
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
rather,
it's
an
as-applied
argument.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
issue
that
was
before
the
circuit
court
was
whether
the
application
of
section
408
to
this
particular
case...
and
of
course
408
is
what
gives
the
court
jurisdiction...
whether
applying
that
to
this
case
violates
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
justice
scalia,
in
the
united
states
versus
eichman,
that
statute
at
issue
there
had
statutory
direct
appeal
language
that
was
exactly
the
language
of
412.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i
believe
that
you
can
take
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
case
because,
as
i
was
saying,
in
united--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--oh,
section
412
provides
direct
appeal
from
either
court,
unlike
the
flag
protection
act
direct
appeal
language,
which
must
be
from
the
district
court.
section
412
doesn't
limit
it
to
an
appeal
from
the
district
court.
it
can
be
either
one.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry.
with
respect
to...
it's
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
65a.
and
the
direct
appellate
language
that
was
at
issue
in
the
flag
protection
act
did
limit
the
appeal
to
appeals
from
the
district
court.
but
section
412
is
different
from
that.
it
doesn't--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--well,
justice
alito,
the
argument
we
made
was
that
to
reach
that
decision
there
were
a
couple
of
sub-arguments
the
court
had
to
reach.
we
had
argued
that,
number
one,
is
there
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
if
not,
then
is
an
employee
who
meets
the
i'll
call
the
duties
test
that
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
is
that
employee's
claim
jurisdictionally
barred
from
court
review,
and
if
so
does
mr.
hanson
meet
that
duties
test?
now,
the
court
could
have
decided
that
mr.
hanson
doesn't
meet
the
duties
test,
therefore
we
never
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
and
that
would
have
been
a
decision
on
his
duties,
not
on
the
constitution.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
he
did
not
dispute
his
duties.
what
he
disputed
was...
what
he
said
was
that
of
the
duties
we
set
forth
in
the
affidavit...
and
that
was
mr.
kimball's
declaration,
which
is
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
66a...
he
said
that
they
represent
only
5
percent
of
his
legislative
duties
over
the
course
of
his
employment.
well,
of
course,
we're
not
setting
forth
every
jurisdictional
duty
he
had
over
the
course
of
his
employment.
so
he--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--no,
justice
alito,
the
court
didn't
rule
that.
the
court
just
gave
us
a
minute
order,
and
there's
a
possibility
that
it
ruled
that,
but
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
just
said
it
doesn't
matter
what
test
you're
telling
me,
counsel,
because
this
particular
employee
doesn't
meet
your
test
to
begin
with.
so
i'm
saying,
the
court
could
have
said,
i'm
saying
he
doesn't
meet--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--it
is
a...
not
the
district
court
ruling.
not
the
district
court.
the
appellate
court,
yes.
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
the
appellate
court,
yes;
the
district
court,
no,
because
the
district
court
was
merely
a
minute
order.
and
it's
a
possibility
that
it
could
have
been
unconstitutional
and
a
possibility
it
could
not.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
section
408
as
applied
to
this
case
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
well,
when
congress--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--yes,
and
in
united
states
versus
eichman,
justice
scalia,
the
very
same
language
was
at
issue.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
yes,
united
states
versus
eichman
is
cited
at
the
appellant's
reply
brief
at
page
1.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
and
the
statutory
section
is
18
u.s.c.
section
700(d),
and
the
direct
appeal
language
is
exactly
the
same,
"upon
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
this
act.
"
and
this
court
accepted
direct
appeal
when
the
issue
was
whether
the
application
of
the
flag
protection
act
was
unconstitutional.
in
any
event,
even
if
this
court
were
not
to
take
jurisdiction--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--counsel
argued
both,
but
this
court
did
not
deal
with
both.
this
court
actually
took
direct
appeal
just
on
the
as-applied
argument.
counsel
argued
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
the
second
argument
was--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--what
the
court
held
was--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--it
was
the
application
in
that
particular
situation.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
well,
the--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--well,
there
were
two
questions
that
the
parties
raised.
one
was,
is
the
statute
unconstitutional
altogether.
and
the
court
didn't
even
touch
that.
instead
the
second
argument
they
raised
was
well,
is
it
constitutional...
unconstitutional,
rather,
as
applied
on
these
facts?
and
that
is
what
the
court
took
the
case
on,
that
was
what
allowed
direct
jurisdiction.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
remember
what
the
lower
court
held
in
that
case--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--right.
unconstitutional
as
applied
so
it
was
an
as
applied
argument.
and
now
when
the
court
wants
a
statute
to
mean
that
it's
only
an
unconstitutional
interpretation
as
opposed
to
a
constitutional
interpretation,
the
court...
i'm
sorry,
congress
makes
that
distinction.
so
for
example
in
28
u.s.c.
section
1257,
which
was
a
direct
appeals
statute,
and
has
since
been
repealed,
in
that
statute
congress
did
say
that
there
is
direct
appeal
when
the
statute
is
found
to
be
constitutional,
or
when
the
statute
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
but
it
used...
congress,
that
is,
used
the
vague
language,
more
vague
and
general
language
in
section
412,
which
is
just
upon
the
constitutionality.
in
any
event--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--not
that
i
recall
in
the
eichman
case.
not
that
i
recall.
okay.
in
any
case,
this
court
should
accept
the
petition,
take
this
case
on
a
petition
for
writ
because
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
upon
a
question
of
federal
law
that
is
an
important
question.
moving
to
my
speech
or
debate
clause
argument,
with
respect
to
speech
or
debate
clause,
this
court
has
held
that
all
acts
that
are
within
the
legitimate
legislative
sphere
are
protected
by
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity.
and
the
court
has
defined
what
is
inside
that
sphere
as
anything
that
is
part
of
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process.
and
when
an
employee
is
an
alter
ego,
that
is,
a
second
self
of
a
member,
that
employee
by
definition
is
actually
performing
part
of
the
member's
job.
he
is
performing
legislative
acts
so
he
is
in
this
sphere.
he
is
doing
something
that
is
part
of
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process.
he
is
in
that
sphere.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
justice
breyer,
he
did
significantly
more
than
that.
first--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--oh,
justice--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--justice
breyer--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--actually
in
the
kimball
declaration,
which
is
at
jurisdictional
statement
66a,
and
the
self
evaluation
of
mr.
hanson
which
is
attached
thereto
as
a
jurisdictional
statement
at
78a,
and
this
is
his
self
evaluation
and
mr.
kimball,
his
supervisor
at
the
time
telling
what
he
had
done,
he
being
mr.
hanson.
some
of
the
things
mr.
hanson
did
was
he
did
talk
to
constituents,
but
remember
of
course
the
member
is
in
d.c.;
he
is
supposed
to
be
representing
people
in
the
state.
the
very
people
who
have
contact
with--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--justice
breyer
actually
he
did
both
of
those.
he
for
example,
when
talking
to
the
constituents
realized
that
there
was
a
problem
with
respect
to
ambulance
reimbursement
for
health
care.
he
went
to
the
senator
and
said
we've
got
a
problem
here
in
the
state,
and
the
constituents
have
identified
it.
he
then
said
to
the
senator,
i
think
you
should
draft
legislation
on
this
and
i
think
you
should
have
a
committee
hearing
on
this.
both
of
which
the
senator
did.
mr.
hanson
drafted
that
legislation.
he--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--yes,
he
did.
he
drafted--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--that
is
in
the
kimball
declaration
which
is
jurisdictional
statements
at
page
66a.
and
he
also
prepared
the
witnesses
for
the
hearings.
justice...
i'm
sorry,
senator
dayton
had
the
hearing
on
the
health
care
issue,
and
mr.
hanson
identified
the
witnesses
for
that,
prepared
them,
wrote
the
questions
for
the
hearing
and--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--because
it
is--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--the
whole
suit
is
precluded
because
when
you
have
as
we
do
an
employee
who
is
in
this
legislative
sphere,
that
the
court
has
identified,
he
is
in
that
sphere
because
he
is
performing
legislative
acts.
so
a
member
who
decides,
you
know,
i
don't
want
him
in
my
legislative
duties
anymore,
my
sphere,
i'm
pulling
him
out.
taking
him
out,
when
the
member
takes
him
out
of
that
process,
he
has
done
something...
he
being
the
member...
that
is
also
part
of
the
functioning
of
the
legislative
process,
which
is
the
test.
so
the
termination
itself
is
part
of
the
functioning
of
the
legislative
process
which
is
the
test
for
a
legislative
act.
and
therefore
this
case
is
predicated
on
a
legislative
act.
that
is,
the
termination.
and
in
doe
v.
mcmillan
this
court
stated
that
a
case
that
is
predicated
on
a
legislative
cannot
be
adjudicated.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
firing
not
anyone
is
a
legislative
act,
but
firing
your
second
self
is
a
legislative
act.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
are
doing
something
that
is
part
of
your
legislative
process.
you
created
a
hole
in
your
legislative
process;
you
have
taken
out
an
employee
who
is
your
second
self.
this
is
your
second
self.
and
you've
decided,
you
know,
i
think
my
legislative
process
is
going
to
work
better
with
him
gone.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry.
i
still
didn't
hear.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
well,
in
gravel,
in
united
states
vs.
gravel,
this
court
stated
not
only
do
you
have
second
selves,
but
you
must...
members
must
delegate
and
redelegate
and
redelegate
authority.
that
implies
there
are
a
lot
of
second
selves.
it's
not
one
person.
so
there
can
be--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--what's
wrong
with
that
solution
is
that
when
a
member,
as
i
was
explaining
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
questions,
when
a
member
has
a
second
self
who
is
in
the
legislative
process
and
the
member
says
you
know,
i'm
pulling
him
out
of
the
process
because
he
doesn't
perform
well,
he...
i
don't
think
he
is
my
second
self,
that
termination
for
whatever
reason
is
part
of
the
process
because
the
member
has
changed
the
process.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
the...
it
is
a
whole
employee.
when
he
is
removed
from
the
process
for
whatever
reason,
he
is
gone
from
the
process
so
that
is
part
of
the
functioning
of
the
process.
if
i
may
give
an
example,
let's
say
that
the
senator
is
at
union
station
and
he
is
buying
a
gift
for
someone
and
he
hears
someone
making
very
derogatory
statements
to
the
cashier,
and
he
turns
around
and
lo
and
behold,
this
is
his
legislative
director.
and
he
says
i
can't
have
this
person
as
my
second
self;
i
don't
talk
to
individuals
that
way;
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
legislative
process
but
this
is
a
second
self
and
he
is
not
my
second
self
and
i
pull
him
out
of
the
process.
that
has
affected
his
legislative
process.
he
now
has
a
hole
in
this
sphere,
this
legislative
sphere.
the
person
is
gone.
that
is
a
part
of
his
legislative
process.
it
doesn't
matter
why
he
is
gone.
he
is
gone.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
i'm
sorry?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
where
you
cannot
invoke
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
was
that
the
question,
or
can?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
if
i
may
answer
the
second
question
first,
approximately
75
percent
of
the
people
who
are
covered
by
this
act,
the
employees
who
are
covered
by
this
act
are
not
employed
by
members
of
congress
or
committees.
now
those
employees
for
the
most
part...
and
not
all
of
them,
because
some
of
those
employees
do
work
on
the
floor,
but
for
the
most
part--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--and
those
employees--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--no,
justice
kennedy,
those
employees...
first
of
all
some
of
those
employees
can
sue.
for
example
the
court
has
said
that
writing
news
releases
or
newsletters
to
constituents,
this
is
in
the
brewster
case,
are
not,
that
is
not
a
legislative
act.
so
if
we
have
an
employee
in
a
member's
office
like
the
deputy
press
secretary
who
does
those
kind
of
things,
that
person
is
not
performing
legislative
acts.
but
in
addition
to
that
these
employees
still
have
a...
a
forum;
their
forum
is
the
office
of
compliance,
which
is
unique
to
the
congressional
accountability
act.
and
the
office
of
compliance
has
cases
heard
before
retired
judges;
the
employees
get
the
same
remedies
as
they
would
in
court.
it
is
the
same
procedure
except
that
it
is
an
expedited
procedure
and
it
is
a
confidential
procedure.
so
these
employees
are,
it's
not
that
they
can't
sue;
it's
that
they
cannot
sue
in
federal
court.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
with
respect
to
the
abatement
issue,
i
would...
this
is
with
respect
to
the
abatement
issue...
i
would
say
that
the
case
would
not
be
abated,
because
the
defendant
would
still
exist.
but
with
respect
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause
issue
i
would
say
it
could
not
still
go
forward,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
immunity
is,
as
this
court
stated
in
gravel,
is
not
like
a
badge
that
attaches
to
different
people
and
different
entities.
it's
an
expression
of
a
policy,
which
means
that
whenever
a
case
is
going
to
infringe
into
this
legislative
sphere,
irrespective
of
who
the
defendant
is,
then
the
case
could
not
be
adjudicated
in
a
federal
court.
and
so
for
example
in
eastland
versus
servicemen's
fund
this
court
stated
that
a
committee
of
the
senate
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
and
in
tenney
although
that
was
a
state
case,
the
court
did
apply
the
speech
or
debate
clause
jurisprudence.
the
court
there
said
that
a
committee
of
the
state
is
covered
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
and
the
case
would
be
dismissed.
and
then
in
doe
vs.
mcmillan,
in
that
case
there
was
a
consultant
to
congress
and
he
was
sued.
there
was
functionaries
of
congress
that
did
not
work
for
a
member,
did
not
work
for
a
committee
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
if
those,
if
the
consultant
and
the
functionaries
were
performing
duties
that
were
within
this
legislative
sphere,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
clause
applies
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
in
the
scenario
where
the
congress
is
the
defendant?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
well,
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
termination
itself,
the
termination
itself
is
a
legislative
act
because
the
termination
itself
is
part
of
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process.
and
in
doe
v.
mcmillan
the
court
stated
that
when
a
case
is
predicated
on
a
legislative
act,
court
jurisdiction
is
barred.
now
also
in
answer
to
your
question
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
defendant
is.
the
member,
let's
say
congress
was--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--no
justice
ginsburg,
there
has
been
no
waiver--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--i'm
sorry.
justice
souter,
sorry.
justice
souter--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--sorry.
justice
souter,
sorry,
justice
souter.
there
has
been
no
waiver
for
the
senate
as
a
defendant.
section
1408
of
the
caa
which
of
course
gives
the
court
jurisdiction--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--that
is
correct,
because--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
souter.
there
is
no
defendant
that
exists
any
more.
the
only
defendant
in
the
caa,
and
the
language
is
very
express,
is
the
employing
office
and
the
employing
office
is
defined
in
section
1301(9)
as,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
"the
personal
office
of
a
member
of
congress.
"
and
there
is
no
member
of
congress--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
no
defendant
any
more.
this
defendant
has
ceased
to
exist
and
this
case
has
abated.
there
is
no
successor
and
when
there
is
no
successor
there
are
not
two
adversarial
parties
in
the
case.
there's
no
case
or
controversy,
case
is
moot,
and
the
case
should
be
dismissed
on
that
basis
alone.
why...
the
court
does
not
even
have
to
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
with
respect
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause
because
this
case
became
moot
in
january
when
the
function
of
the
office,
which
was
solely
to
support
senator
dayton...
when
there
was
no
senator
dayton
there
was
no
office
of
senator
dayton.
there
is
no
defendant
that
is
extant
in
this
case
and
therefore
the
case--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--justice
scalia,
it
is
not
just
a
fiction.
the
office--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--it
is,
justice
scalia,
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
has
a
condition
on
it.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
it
is
unequivocal--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--well,
first,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
in
that
i
don't
think
it
is
a
fiction
that
this
office
never
existed.
the
office,
the
personal
office
of
a
member
of
congress...
members
of
congress
didn't
work
out
in
the
hallway
before
the
caa
was
passed.
there
was
always
a
personal
office
of
a
member
of
congress.
so
in
that
sense
it
is
not
a
fiction.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
well,
actually
the
structure
doesn't
support
that.
the
senate,
within
the
senate,
each
member
does
pay
the
salary,
sets
the
salary.
we
can
have
legislative
directors
and
do
have
legislative
directors
in
two
different
offices,
different
salaries,
different
numbers
of
paid
days,
different
number
of
annual
leave
days.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
it
is
paid
for--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
justice
scalia,
actually
the
senate
is
given
an
appropriation
and
all
of
his
salaries
must
be
paid
from
the
appropriation.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
it
is
the
appropriated
fund
for
the
senator
and
the
senator
is
the
one
who
pays
the
fund.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
there
are
four
instances
in
which
the
court
has
found
that
jurisdiction
is
barred
in
speech
or
debate
clause
cases.
the
first
is
when
the
case
is
predicated
on
a
legislative
act.
the
second
is
when
the
case
cannot,
that
is
cannot
be
adjudicated
without
questioning
a
legislative
act
or
the
motive
for
the
act.
and
the
third
is
when
the
member
will
be
made
to
answer
in
terms
of
his
defense
for
a
legislative
act.
this
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
stevens
asked.
in
gravel
the
court
made
it
clear
that
if
the
member
is
made
to
answer
in
his
defense
for
a
legislative
act,
that
violates
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
under
the,
these
types
of
cases
the
member
does,
would
have
to
come
forward
and
explain
a
legislative
act:
that
is,
why
did
i
terminate
this
employee?
that
is
the
explanation,
because
the
termination
itself
is
a
legislative
act,
he
is
being
questioned
about
a
legislative
act.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
direct
me...
i'm
sorry.
me
personally?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
to
pay
the
judgment?
ms.
jean
m.
manning
they
cannot
direct
us
to
pay.
it
of
course
comes
out
of
the
treasury
fund
and
the
senate
has
had
absolutely
no
control
or
involvement
at
all
for
12
years
in
any
of
these
cases.
they
do
not
know--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--well,
i
believe
that
it
cannot
because
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
employing
office.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
so
for
that
reason
the
senate
has
never,
doesn't
even
know
the
cases
exist.
doesn't
know
that
we
are
negotiating
settlement.
doesn't
review
settlement
agreements.
is
not
involved
in
strategy.
in
fact
the
caa
in
section
403
states
that
the,
that
the
mediation
and
then
the
counseling
in
the
case
is
strictly
confidential.
the
senate
cannot
even
know
that
they
are
happening.
only
the
employing
office
can
know.
in
no
sense
has
the
senate
been
the
defendant.
if
the
senate
has
been
defendant--
ms.
jean
m.
manning
--where
this
they
been
for
twelve
years?
they
have
not
been
in
these
cases
for
twelve
years.
ms.
jean
m.
manning
thank
you.
