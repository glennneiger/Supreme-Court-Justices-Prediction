justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
wasn't
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
a
ruling
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied?
as
i
understand
it,
you
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that
an
individual
performing
the
duties
that
mr.
dayton
performed
cannot
sue
a
member
of
congress
for
employment
discrimination
and
the
district
court
denied
that.
why
isn't
that
a
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
the,
of
the
statute
as
applied?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
a
dispute
about
the
nature
of
his
duties?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
how
you
characterize
his
duties,
but
what
his
duties
actually
were.
was
there
a
dispute
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
didn't
the
district
court
rule
that
somebody
performing
those
duties
can
constitutionally
be
tried...
bring
suit,
and
it
doesn't,
and
it
doesn't
violate
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
so
i
don't
see
how
that's
not
a
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
statute--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
this
statute
was
set
up
so
that
the
defendant
here
was
the
senate,
as
opposed
to
the
office
of
a
senator,
would
you
still
say
that
this
suit
couldn't
go
forward?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
what
sense
would
the
member
be
called
to
answer
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
member
isn't
a
defendant
and
has
no
financial
liability
and
is
able
to
invoke
the
clause
as
an
evidentiary
privilege?
in
what
sense
would
the
speech
or
debate
clause
be
applicable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
were
told
that
75
percent
of
the
employees
who
were
covered
by
the
act
do
not
work
for
an
individual
member.
so
how
could,
how
could
a
provision
held
to
be
facially
unconstitutional
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
could
it
possibly
be?
and
if
it
couldn't
possibly
be
then
what
did
congress
have
in
mind
when
it
provided
it
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
