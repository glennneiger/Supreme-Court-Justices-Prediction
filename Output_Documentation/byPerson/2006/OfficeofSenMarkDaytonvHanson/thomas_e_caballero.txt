mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
justice
stevens
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court
under
section
412.
but
i
first
would
like
to
correct
one
of
the
answers
regarding
cases
under
this
congressional
accountability
act.
two
cases
have
been
finally
adjudicated
by
the
district
courts.
one
was
two
cases
against
offices
of
members
or
committees
where
an
employee
worked
for
a
member.
one
of
those
involved
a
finding
that
it
was
outside
the
limitations
in
the
statute.
the
other
case
was
a
summary
judgment
finding
of
an
employee
who
was
a
legislative
employee
of
the
committee
on
ways
and
means
and
the
court
found
that
the
dismissal
there
was
on
an
allowable
ground
under
the
statute
and
there
was
no
violation
of
the
employee's
rights.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
because,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
decision
on
the
scope
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
that
clause
is
preserved
in
section
413
of
the
act
and
therefore
there
would
be
no
appeal
under
section
412.
if
the
court
does
go
to
the
merits
in
this
matter,
i
think
it's
important
to
effectuate
congress'
intent
in
enacting
the
statute
along
with
its
concerns
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
speech
or
debate
clause
provides
senators
and
representatives
with
a
constitutional
privilege
that
is
critical
to
securing
the
independence
of
the
legislative
branch
in
our
system
of
government.
certainly,
congress
is
the
institution
that
has
the
greatest
interest
in
and
is
most
sensitive
to
maintaining
a
robust
speech
or
debate
privilege
under
this
court's
precedence.
in
enacting
the
congressional
accountability
act,
however,
congress
concluded
that
it
could
provide
its
own
employees
with
the
same
employment
law
protections
that
it
had
already
provided
executive
branch
employees
and
private
sector
employees,
including
the
critical
right
of
action
for
victims
of
illegal
discrimination
to
bring
suit
in
the
federal
court;
and
that
a
suit
under
the
act
would
not
infringe
upon
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
congress
relied
on
this
court's
own
precedent
in
making
that
determination.
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
clause
is
robust,
protects
activities
outside
of
just
speech
and
debate
on
the
floor
of
either
house,
but
that
it
shouldn't
be
extended
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
legislative
process.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
well,
that
is
an
application
of
section
413,
the
preservation
of
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
our
view
is
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
the
eichman
case
they
cited.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
for
a
finding
of
jurisdiction
later,
that's
correct.
i
would
say--
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
--right.
based
on
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
would
say
the
two
arguments
as
applied
in
the
preservation
of
section
413
aren't
wholly
separate.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
well,
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
about
the
separation
of
powers
generally.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
well,
i
think
the
provision
wasn't
held
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
again,
there
was
major
debate
in
the
congress
over
whether
or
not
the
provision
of
judicial
hearing
of
suits
over
congressional
employment
decisions,
separate
from
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
just
a
separation
of
powers
concern
of
having
the
judiciary
oversee
the
workings
of
congress,
and
there
was
a
concern
about
that
separation
of
powers
issue,
which
would
be
a
facial
issue.
can
you
hear
any
suits
by
employees
of
congress
who
are
employed
in
a
separate
branch?
and
that
was
where
this
provision
has
life,
and
is
meant
to
protect
the
ability
for
a
litigant
to
bring
it
before
this
court
immediately;
it
would
be
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
right.
it
preserves
a
member's...
exactly.
it
preserves
a
member's
speech
or
debate.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
and
when
congress
did
provide
these
rights
under
the
statute,
it
was
very
important
for
the
congress
under
the
previous
regime
affecting
the
senate,
employees
had
employment
protections
and
they
had
administrative
processes
that
they
could
go
to.
but
they
lacked
a
judicial
right.
and
congress
made
a
specific
decision
that
providing
that
right
of
action
was
an
important
employment
law
protection
employees
needed.
and
again
it
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
both
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
as
to
the
scope
of
the
clause
and
under
forrester
where
this
court
held
that
a
judge's
employment
decision
as
to
an
employee
who
did
judicial
duties
was
not
a
judicial
act,
did...
achieve
absolute
immunity.
it
was
a...
it
was
an
administrative
act,
an
employment
act.
and
similarly
here
what
is
brought
before
the
courts
is
an
employment
act.
again
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there
has
been
no
discovery.
there
has
been
no
litigation
over
the
claims
involved.
there
is
just
a
question
presented
does
the
speech
or
debate
clause
bar
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
when
a
legislative,
an
employee
with
any
legislative
duties
brings
a
suit
under
the
act?
and
i
think
the
question,
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
no.
indeed
in
the
case
here,
you
could
have
litigation
over
whether
the
senator
knew
of
the
alleged
disability.
that's
one
of
the
disputes
that's
been
laid
out
in
the
pleadings,
whether
that
was
the
basis
for
the,
for
the
decision
to
terminate
the
employee.
these
are
all
the
types
of
issues
that
play
out
in
district
courts.
district
courts
receive
evidence.
they
make
these
judgments;
they
see
the
specific
context
and
they
make
specific
rulings.
to
try
to
decide
in
the
abstract
how
you
would
apply
an
employment
law
case
with
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
an
evidentiary
sense
is
very
difficult.
and
that's
why
a
more
full
record
would
be
necessary.
but
to
decide
the
question
on
appeal,
i
think
the
court
can
easily
decide
if
these
cases
go
forward.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
to
address
the
issue
of
the
existence
of
the
office.
it's
not
a
mere
creation
of
the
act.
senators
have
personal
offices.
those
offices
incur
liabilities
or
obligations.
they
buy
paper;
they
make
contracts
and
the
like.
when
a
senator
leaves
office,
the
employing
office
still
has
to
pay
the
bills
that
were
incurred
when
the
senator
was
in
office.
and
the
senate
allows
employing
offices
under
the
approval
of
the
former
member
to
submit
the
vouchers
and
receive
payment.
the
employing
office
has
life
afterwards.
similarly
here,
if
it
incurs
an
employment
liability
it
has
life
sufficient
to
litigate
whether
or
not
that
liability
exists
and
a
judgment
will
be
paid
under
government
funds
under
the
act.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
yes.
the
money
is
an
appropriation
of
senate...
and
under
the
fund,
the
money
is
an
appropriation
for
the
specific
fund
under
the
act
for
paying
judgements
in
these
cases.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
under
the
act
there
is.
congress
decided
to
not
have
any
personal
liability
for
a
member
to
shield
them
from
that,
and
also
not
to
require
the
member's
office
in
cases
such
as
illegal
discrimination
cases,
to
pay
the
awards
or
judgments.
mr.
thomas
e.
caballero
perhaps
it's
a
party
in
interest,
but
i
would
say
again
that
the
named
party
is
not
a
party
without
any
life
except
under
the
act.
i
thank
the
court.
