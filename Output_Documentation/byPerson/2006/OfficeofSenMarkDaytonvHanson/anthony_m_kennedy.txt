justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
that
citation?
i
was
looking
for
that.
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
we
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
on
its
face?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
look
at
eichman,
but
it's
not
my
recollection
of
the
case,
that
the
whole,
the
essence
of
the
duty
imposed
by,
under
the
statute
was
held
void.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there's
always
an
application
or
there's
no
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
absent
some
declaratory
judgment
provision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
eichman
we
recite
that
the
district
court
held
the
act
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellees
and
dismissed
the
charges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
a...
can
you
give
me
examples
of
cases
where
that
act
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
instances
in
which
employees
of
an
the
office
of
a
senator
are
covered
by
these
obligations
and
cannot
invoke
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
what's
the
classic
example
where
you
can't
invoke
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
just
completely
eviscerates
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
passing
this
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
the
act
itself
has
a
provision
for
office
of
senators.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
it
seems
to
me
you're
giving
no
effect
to
that.
you
say
there
is
a
hole
in
the
process
the
minute
the
furniture
mover
is
gone?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
test
for
intruding?
if
it
would
chill
his
exercise
of
the
function
in
future
cases,
or
if
it
requires
him
to
talk
about
legislative
decisions,
or
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
it
required
him
to
say
how
he
allocated
his
resources,
that
he
allocate
his
resources
10
percent
to
foreign
affairs
issues,
50
percent
to
health
care
issues?
would
that
involve
is...
is
that
a
speech
or
debate
clause
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question.
the
appellants
here
were
the
ones
that
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals?
did
they
appeal
from
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
1291,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
jurisdiction
where
direct
review
may
be
had
in
the
supreme
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
their
position
contradicts
their
own
basis
for
jurisdiction
here.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
my
point
is
that
the
appellants
are
telling
us
that
this
is
appealable
here
directly,
but
if
that's
so
they
shouldn't
have
gone
to
court
of
appeals,
they
shouldn't
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals;
they're
untimely
when
they
come
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
eichman,
i
was
able
to
get
out
the
district
court
and
the
last
part
of
the
district
court,
the
last
line
of
the
district
court,
it
says
the
law
under
which
these
three...
let
me
begin
again...
the
law
under
which
these
three
defendants
have
been
prosecuted
is
unconstitutional,
which
seems
to
me
to
contradict
what
appellant's
counsel
told
us
about
what
happened
in
the
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
i
have
one...
one
question.
could
the
senate
direct
you
to
pay
this
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
direct
your
office
to...
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it...
suppose
they
thought
there
was
liability
and
if
you
say
yes,
then
i
need
to
know
why
you
and
counsel
who
just
addressed
this
are
on
different
sides
of
the
case,
if
you're
both
representing
the
senate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
it,
if
it
chose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
