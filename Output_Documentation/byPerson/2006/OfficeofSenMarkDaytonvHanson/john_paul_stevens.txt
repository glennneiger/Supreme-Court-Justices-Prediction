justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
hear
argument
in
no.
06-618,
the
office
of
senator
mark
dayton
against
brad
hanson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
flag
case
the
whole
statute
was
either
valid
or
not.
there
weren't
different
applications,
were
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
simply
didn't
rule
hold
was
a
right
to
burn
flags
in
some
cases
and
not
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
puzzled.
firing
somebody
is
a
legislative
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
firing
someone
is
a
legislative
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salzman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
his
dissent...
or
defense,
rather,
to
the
charge
is
that
he
was
very
inefficient
in
giving
me
help
in
legislative
hearings
and
so
forth,
or
words
of
that
kind
which
might
be
arguably
a
legislative
act,
and
that
speech
or
debate
clause
forbids
inquiry
into
the
quality
of
his
performing
those
duties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
the
senator
might
argue
that
this
is
all
privileged:
it's
the
reason
i
fired
him,
but
i
can't
go
into
it
because
i
don't
want
to
invade
my
own
privilege
not
to
discuss
matters
that
are
covered
by
the
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
quite
capture
the
problem
that
i'm
having.
it's
not
that
the
plaintiff
can't
inquire.
usually
they
can't.
but
my
thought
is
that
the
defendant
cannot
put
in
his
own
defense
without
waiving
the
privilege
that
would
otherwise
be
applicable.
so
he's
sort
of
in
a
dilemma.
either
i
give
up
my
constitutional
right
not
to
talk
about
this
stuff
or
i've
got
to
waive
that
right
in
order
to
give
a
full
explanation
of
why
i
discharged
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
he
just
wrote
a
lousy
memo.
in
order
to
demonstrate
it's
lousy,
i've
got
to
talk
about
legislative
matters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
senator
did
not
have
a
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
salzman.
mr.
caballero.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
manning,
you
have
about
a
minute
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
manning--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you,
ms.
manning.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
congressional
accountability
act
of
1995
provides
employees
of
members
of
congress
for
the
remedy
of
certain
adverse
employment
actions.
invoking
the
district
court
jurisdiction
under
that
act
appellee
brad
hanson
brought
this
damages
action
against
the
appellant
the
office
of
former
senator
mark
dayton.
he
alleged
that
he
had
been
terminating
in
violation
of
three
federal
statutes.
the
senator’s
office
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
based
on
a
claim
of
immunity
under
the
constitution’s
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
office
then
invoked
our
jurisdiction
under
§412
of
the
statute
and
we
proposed
consideration
of
jurisdiction
tending
hearing
the
case
on
the
merits.
for
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
conclude
that
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
under
§412
of
the
act.
we
therefore
dismissed
the
appeal.
moreover,
treating
the
appellant’s
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
we
deny
the
petition
because
the
decision
of
the
d.
c.
circuit
is
not
in
obvious
conflict
with
any
of
its
sister
circuits
on
the
application
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
to
suits
challenging
personnel
decision
of
members
of
congress.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
deliberation
of
the
case.
