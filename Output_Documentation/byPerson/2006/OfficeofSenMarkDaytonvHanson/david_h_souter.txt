justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
a
further
problem
here,
though,
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
gave
no
explanation?
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
why
the
court
ruled
the
way
it
did,
and
for
that
reason
the
appeal,
the
review,
was
that
the
original
appeal
was
taken
properly
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
that
we
are
here
not
on
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
cert
jurisdiction,
if
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
direct
appeal.
we
have
appellate
jurisdiction
only
if
there's
a
direct
appeal
and
there's
no
direct
appeal.
this
is
coming
from
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
pages
are
the
text
of
412
set
out
on?
you're
going
to
have
to
help
me
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize,
before
you
leave
that
i
realize
that
on
a
jurisdictional
issue
like
that
we
have
an
obligation
to
raise
it
ourselves.
but
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
curious,
was...
was
jurisdiction
contested
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
they
get
into...
no,
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
why
doesn't
it
matter
who
the
defendant
is?
because
i
don't,
this
so-called
office
of
senator
mark
dayton
is
a
construct
that
i
understand,
and
there
is
no
immunity
problem
there.
but
if,
if
that
office
is
gone
now
and
getting
to
your
hypothesis,
if
the,
if...
if
the
true
party
is
the
senate
of
the
united
states,
has
there
been
any
unequivocal
waiver
of
immunity
with
respect
to
the
entire
senator
or
the
senate
of
the
united
states
as
an
institution?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
justice
souter.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
very
flattering.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
was
just
going
to
say
if
this
case
continues
we've
got
to
accept
the
proposition
that
the
office
of
senator
mark
dayton
is
still
a,
some
kind
of
an
entity
that
has
got
to
be
accorded
reality
by
the
judiciary,
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
we
do
it?
i
mean,
you've
said...
i
don't
want
to
go
too
far
with
a
metaphor,
but
you
spoke
a
moment
ago
of
there
being
sort
of
a,
what
did
you
say,
a
hole
or
a
space
in
the
legislative
sphere
when
somebody
is
fired.
in
the
sphere
at
the
moment
is
totally
empty.
the
senator's
gone.
everybody
knows
that
this,
this
office
of
senator
mark
dayton
is
a
totally
fictional
construct.
and
in
reality,
as
you
point
out,
the
money
is
going
to
come
out
of
the
senate
or
some
senate
fund.
if
we
allow
this
to
go
forward,
we've
got
to
face
the
reality
that
it's
the
senate
which
is
the
defendant
and
there
hasn't
been
a
waiver
of
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
at
this
point
that's
silly.
there's
no
senator.
there's
no
office
in
any
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
unequivocal?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
when
it's
done
on
the
basis
of
this
fiction,
is
that
what
we
should
accept
as
an
unequivocal
waiver?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what
if
the
senator
doesn't
want
to
put
it
in?
i
mean,
what
if
he
does
not
want
to
waive
the
privilege?
is
his
only
choice
in
effect
to
sit
moot
and
lose
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
"mute"
i
guess
i
should
have
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
don't,
why
doesn't
that...
why
doesn't
being
placed
in
that
dilemma
in
effect
implicate
the
clause,
and
why
can't
he
invoke
the
clause
as
a
basis
for
dismissal?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
so
far
as
the
member's
immediate
financial
concern,
they
took
care
of
it.
but
i'm
not
sure
about
the
careful
way.
they
in
effect
said,
you
know,
if
this
gets
into
speech
or
debate
clause
issues
they
prevail.
and
that
kind
of
just
leaves
us
with
no
solution
for
the
problem
that
justice
stevens
raised
and
that
i'm
concerning
with,
unless
there's,
there's
going
to
be
an
automatic
dismissal
when
the
member
says,
look,
i
cannot
respond
to
this
without
getting
into,
into
acts
within
the
legislative
process
which
are
privileged.
unless
you
want
to
recognize
that
as
kind
of
an
absolute
defense
upon
its
invocation,
i
don't
see
how
we
get
out
of
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there's
no
jurisdiction
under
412
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
will...
the
money
is
simply
senate
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
none
of
those
funds
are,
as
i
understand
it,
are
somehow
subtracted
from
or
contributed
by
the
funds
of
individual
senatorial
offices
while
a
senator
is
in
office.
i
am
assuming
that
those,
that
there
is
a
separate
appropriation
for
the
payment
of...
of
any
such
judgment,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
the
real
world
then
at
this
point
isn't
the
senate
the...
the
party?
