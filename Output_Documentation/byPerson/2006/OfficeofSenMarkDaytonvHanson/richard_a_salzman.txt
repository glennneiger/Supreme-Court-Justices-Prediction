mr.
richard
a.
salzman
justice
stevens
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
raised
a
single
issue,
the
issue
of
absolute
immunity;
more
specifically,
whether
the
employing
office
created
by
congress
as
the
defendant
in
these
kinds
of
cases
can
be
sued
by
a
member
of
a
senator
or
a
house
of
representatives
staff.
the
dayton
office
argues
that
a
senator's
personnel
decisions
are
always
a
legislative
act
that
are
always
absolutely
immunized
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
that
argument
is
untenable
and
it
was
rejected
by
every
one
of
the
eight
judges
of
the
d.c.
circuit
en
banc.
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
legislative
acts.
mr.
hanson
didn't
work
on
capitol
hill.
he
was
in
the
minnesota
office.
his,
the
nature
of
his
claim
is
that
he
was
a
valued
employee
until
he
became
ill
and
disclosed
his
illness
and
need
for
surgery,
at
which
point
he
was
fired.
senator
dayton's
office
first
says
that
they
were
not
even
aware,
that
senator
dayton
was
unaware
of
the
need
for
surgery
at
the
time
he
made
the
decision
to
fire
mr.
hanson,
and
then
says
that
the
reason
for
the
firing
was
mr.
hanson's
work
on
a
classic
constituent
service.
this
case
presents
exactly
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
about.
although
mr.
hanson
had
a
very
small,
he
says
5
percent
of
his
duties,
that
were
in
some
way
related
to
the
legislative
process,
no
one
contends,
not
mr.
kimball,
not
senator
dayton's
office,
that
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
reason
for
his
firing.
in
fact,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
in
this
record
so
far,
is
that
on
that
small
amount
of
work
that
mr.
hanson
did
with
respect
to
ambulance
legislation,
he
did
a,
quote
unquote,
"great
job".
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
we
say
that's
absolutely
wrong
justice
scalia,
that
is
absolutely
wrong.
the
reason
is
that
this
court
has
said
that
conduct
that
is
related
to
the
legislative
process,
that
may
in
fact
be
important
to
the
legislative
process,
is
not
itself
a
part
of
the
legislative
process.
that
is
the
fundamental
holding
of
brewster.
and
this
court
has
found
that
some
actions
that
affect
an
employee,
for
example
in
the
bogan
case,
where
a
decision
that
resulted
in
the
termination
of
a
person
was
clearly
legislative
in
nature
because
it
was
made
in
a
legislative
proceeding,
it
was
voted
upon
by
the
legislators,
and
it
was
based
upon
either
budgetary
or
policy
determinations.
that
is
a
legislative
act.
but
this
court
in
bogan
specifically
distinguished
that
circumstance
from
a
classic
personnel
action
firing
such
as
happened
to
mr.
hanson
here.
there
was
no
legislative
act
involved
in
mr.
hanson's
firing.
he
was
just
fired.
the
reason
for
the
firing
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
a
jury
can
sort
out
issues
like
whether
or
not
senator
dayton
had
notice
of
the
need
for
surgery,
whether
or
not
mr.
hanson's
performance
of
classic
constituent
services
was
bad
or
good,
as
we
contend.
but
none
of
that
involves
legislative
activity
as
this
court
has
described
it
under
the
speech
or
debate
act.
so
our
contention
is
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
absolute
immunity
and
there
is
no
absolute
immunity
in
this
case.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
legislative
act,
as
judge
randolph
below
and
all
of
the
judges
below
recognized.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
justice
stevens,
certainly
the
speech
or
debate
clause
does
incorporate...
i'm
sorry.
the
congressional
accountability
act
does
incorporate
the
speech
or
debate
clause
with
respect
to
the
evidentiary
privilege
and
that
is
clear
from
section
413.
in
that
instance,
district
courts
will
have
to
deal
with
the
proffered
evidence
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
obviously,
the
context
matters
with
respect
to
any
evidentiary
privilege.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
well,
justice
stevens,
again
if
the
reason
for
the
firing
would
shed
light
if
the
district
court
would
show
that
the
allowing
the
evidence
that
is
proffered
in
would
so
intrude
upon
a
real
legislative
act,
then
the
district
court
can
excise
that
evidence
from
the
case.
it
either
can
be
taken
out,
as
in
the
helstoski
case.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
i
think,
as
this
court
has
described
it,
justice
kennedy,
if
it
would
compel
the
senator
to
testify
about
his
motives
for
legislation
or
for
a
legislative
act,
then
a
district
court
could
decide
that
that
evidence
would
not
come
in.
the
firing
itself,
however,
is
not
a
legislative
act
and
the
motivation
behind
the
firing
is
not
precluded
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
i
don't
believe
that
it
would,
be
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
intrude
so
much
on
his
goals
with
respect
to
a
particular
piece
of
legislation
or
with
respect
to
a
general
legislative
agenda.
i'm
not
sure
i
would
see
that
his
testifying
about
how
he
has
allocated
money
in
the
office,
for
example,
would
be
anything
other
than
testimony
about
an
administrative
decision.
if
he
were...
for
example,
if
a
plaintiff
certainly
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
in
a
case
about
a
speech
that
the
senator
gave
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
which
he
was
accused
of
making
maybe
a
bigoted
or
a
sexist
remark,
section
413
would
clearly
preclude
that.
and
there
may
be
circumstance,
for
example,
where
if
a
plaintiff
wanted
to
introduce
a
draft
of
the
speech
or
a
draft
of
legislation,
that
a
court,
district
court,
could
in
those
circumstances
say
that
that
intrudes
so
much
on
a
true
legislative
act
that
the
court
could
preclude
that
testimony
from
going
in.
we
don't
believe
that
in
the,
in
the
run
of
these
cases,
that
will
be
difficult
for
the
district
courts
to
handle.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
understood,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
in
most
cases
that
will
not
present
a
dilemma.
even
if
the
senator's
explanation
is,
i
assigned
a
real
legislative
aide
to
research
a
piece
of
legislation
and
i
was
dissatisfied
for
whatever
reason,
suppose
the
reason
is
that
the
aide
simply
didn't
turn
in
the
memo
that
that
he
was
assigned
to
do.
the
senator
testifying
about,
i
gave
an
assignment
to
this
person,
the
due
date
was
september
1st,
i
never
got
it
or
he
was
late
or
it
was
riddled
with
errors--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--if
that
is
truly
the
situation
and
if
a
district
court
assessing,
once
all
of
the
information
is
presented
to
the
district
court,
that
requiring
the
senator
in
that
circumstance
to
discuss
really
his
legislative
goals,
we
think
that
maybe
that
evidence
would
not
be
permitted.
now,
the,
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--well,
in
brewster,
your
honor,
this
court
recognized
that
there
may
be
situations
where
the
court
permits
an
indictment
to
go
forward,
in
which
the
indictment
itself
and
the
proof
that
the
prosecutor
will
be
presenting
does
not
so
intrude
on
the
legislative
process
that
it
would
be
precluded
but
that
the
defendant
may
decide
that
in
order
to
explain
the
accusation
he
needs
to
rely
on
legislative
acts.
and
the
court
recognized
that
that
may
be
the
situation
that
the
senator
is
in.
i
believe
the
third
circuit
in
a
decision
written
by
justice
alito,
the
mcdade
case,
talks
about
that
circumstance,
where
the
senator
at
that
point
can
choose
to
put
in
his
explanation
and
be
subject
to
cross-examination
simply
with
respect
to
that
explanation,
but
that
the
prosecution
is
not
precluded
in
its
entirety.
and
certainly
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
well,
if
he
chooses
to
sit
moot
and
if
the
evidence--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--mute,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
if
he
chooses
to
stay
silent,
then
perhaps
the
case
just
goes
forward
without
an
explanation.
the
defendant--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--well,
judge
randolph
below
thought
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
evidence
is
so,
all
of
the
evidence
is
so
bound
up
in
a
legislative
act
that
the
case
might
not
go
forward.
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
that
will
rarely
be
the
circumstance.
but
this
is
the
system
that
congress
set
up
and
congress
created
the
system
in
a,
in
a
careful
way.
the
defendant
is
not
the
member.
the
member
faces
no
financial
liability
whatsoever
from
a
finding
of
discrimination
or
unlawful
behavior.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
well,
justice
souter,
our
argument
is
that
the
decision
itself
is
certainly
not
a
legislative
act,
and
the
most...
and
that
is
in
accordance
with
this
court's
view
of
the
judicial
privilege
in
forrester
that
the
decision
itself
is
not
a
judicial
act.
the
reasons
behind
the
decision
in
the
legislative
context
could
be
shielded
by
the
evidentiary
privilege,
but
we
think
there's
a
clear
difference
between
the
employees
performing
a
duty
that
is
related
to
the
legislative
process
being
different
than
a
legislative
act
itself.
it
may
be
that
in
some
rare
circumstances
the
senator
in
order
to
fully
defend
himself
feels
the
need
to
actually
testify
about
real
legislative
acts,
such
as
votes
on
something
or
his
conduct
in
a
committee
proceeding.
but
his
assessment
of
an
employee's
performance,
just
as
judge
white's
assessment
in
the
forrester
case
of
miss
forrester's
performance,
is
not
legislative
activity.
it
may
be
activity
that
is
important
to
the
legislative
process.
it
may
provide
for
a
sound
legislative
arena,
just
as
in
the
judicial
sphere.
but
when
this
court
found
unanimous,
unanimously
that
when
judge
white
was
assessing
the
performance
of
miss
forrester
in
the
judicial
context
and
deciding,
i
don't
think
she
did
a
good
job
on
delegated
judicial
functions,
that's
not
a
judicial
act.
and
we
would
say
the
same
with
respect
to
a
legislative
act,
so--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
the
browning
case,
that
the
d.c.
circuit
originally
had
found
would
be
considered
a
legislative
act.
and
we
do
believe
that,
yes,
the
assessment
by
the,
whoever
supervised
miss
browning
that
her
performance
was
inadequate
is
not
itself
a
legislative
activity.
miss
browning's
performance
obviously
was
involved,
was
closely
tied
to
the
legislative
process
because
she
was
a
stenographer
at
hearings.
if
the
committee,
if
the
committee
decided
in
a
committee
proceeding
and
took
a
vote
that
they
were
not
going
to
use
stenographers
any
more
and
miss
browning
had
brought
a
challenge
with
respect
to
that,
alleging
that
it
was
focused
personally
on
her
and
racially
motivated,
then
we
think
a
legislative
immunity
might
apply
as
it
did
in
the
bogan
case.
but
absent
that,
it's
our
belief
that
an
assessment
of
an
employee's
performance,
even
if
the
employee
is
performing
duties
that
are
related
to
the
legislative
process,
is
not
itself
a
legislative
act.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
rare
circumstances
where
the,
the
senator's
assessment
of
the
performance
is
very
tied
up
with
a
legislative
act.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
you
are,
justice
breyer.
the
employee's
performance,
we
believe,
of
the
speech
writing
would
not
be
considered
a
legislative
act.
this
court
said
in
gravel
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
legislative
act
which
goes
on
in
a
committee
proceeding
and
preparation
for
that
proceeding,
and
the
employee's
performance
getting
the
senator
ready
to
give
his
speech
would
not
itself
be
considered
a
legislative
act,
but
in
that
circumstance
the
district
court
might
say
that
because
the
senator's
explanation
is
so
clearly
tied
to
a
real
legislative
act,
a
speech
that
he
actually
gave
on
the
floor
of
the
congress,
perhaps
that
might
be
a
circumstance
where
judge
randolph's
view
that
that
case
could
not
go
forward
might
apply.
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
deals
with
threshold
immunity
issues,
where
the
senator's
office
is
saying
that
any
personnel
decision
that
it
engages
in
is
by
definition
a
legislative
act
if
it
relates
to
anybody
who
works
in
their
office.
and
congress
clearly
was
not
of
that
view.
it
defined
every
employee
of
the
senate,
including
those
who
worked
in
a
senator's
office,
to
be
a
covered
employee
and
all
covered
employees
under
section
408
have
the
right
to
go
to
court.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
no,
justice
ginsburg.
the
closest...
my
understanding
is
the
closest
we
have
gotten
is
the
companion
case
in
this
case,
the
fields
case,
is
scheduled
for
trial
in
october
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
have
gone
through
some
discovery
in
that
case.
i
don't
believe
that
there
have
been
any,
any
cases
under
the
congressional
accountability
act
in
court,
that
have
made
it
past
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--yes.
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
not
entirely,
justice
kennedy.
we
do...
we
had
thought
that
initially
and
then
upon
reflection
it
seemed
to
us
that
because
the
minute
order
of
the
district...
because
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
a
minute
order
that
did
not
explain
its
reasoning,
perhaps
there
was
some
ambiguity
about
whether
he
was
simply
finding
that
mr.
hanson
had
so
little
contact
with
the
legislative
process
that,
that
the
case
should
go
forward
or
whether
he
was
in
essence--
mr.
richard
a.
salzman
--that
is
our
understanding
of
the
way
it
generally
works.
we
believe
that
the
gyra
statute,
which
was
the
predecessor
to
the
congressional
accountability
act,
may
have
permitted
appeals
directly
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court.
so
there
appears
to
be
some
ambiguity.
when
we
first
responded
with
respect
to
the
appeal,
we
did
argue
that
if
senator
dayton's
office
wanted
to
appeal
directly
they
needed
to
do
that
two
years
ago
when
the
district
court
had
ruled.
upon
further
research,
we
were
not
sure
that
that
was
correct,
your
honor.
