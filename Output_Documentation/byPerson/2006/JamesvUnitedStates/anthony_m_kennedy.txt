you
mean
no
facts
in
the
indictment
or
charging
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
in
the
presentence
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
tell
us
what
your
position
is
if
we
choose
to
use
the
noncategorical
or
the
modified
categorical
approach?
is
there
a
nexus
between
what's
in
the
presentence
report
and
some
other
charging
documents,
or
is
it
just
in
the
presentencing
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
this
presentence
report
cannot
be
consulted
under
the
reasoning
of
shepard,
we
need
more?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
the
psr
has
some
kind
of
significance
that
the
police
report
did
not?
