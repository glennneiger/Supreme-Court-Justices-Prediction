justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
could
do
it
in
a
noncurtilage
burglary
state
simply
by
putting
the
ladder
up
to
the
window
and
getting
on
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder.
i
mean,
you
would
have...
you
would
have
taken
a
substantial
step.
you
would
have
made
an
attempt.
now
why
would
that
not
qualify
under
the
words
of
the
statute
that
referred
to
a
potential
risk?
haven't
you
created
the
potential
for
the
risk
of
harm
that
the
statute
is
getting
at
when
you
take
the
substantial
step?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
my
question
first?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
haven't
you
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
created
the
potential
for
the
risk
when
you
take
that
substantial
step
by
starting
up
the
ladder?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
that
analysis
would
not
lead
to
the
result
unfavorable
to
your
client
because
the
nature
of
starting
up
the
ladder
did
not
create
or
could
not
reasonably
be
seen
as
creating
this
kind
of
risk.
in
other
words,
i
thought
you
were
saying...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument...
that
the
reason
the
taylor
analysis
favors
you
is
that
merely
taking
a
substantial
step...
which
is
what
the
indictment
would
charge...
could
not
be
seen
as
creating
the
potential
risk
that
the
statute
talks
about.
now
if
i'm
not
understanding
your
argument
correctly,
you
know,
straighten
me
out
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
why
simply
charging
attempted
burglary
will
never
satisfy
the
statute
under
a
taylor
analysis
as
you
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
one
way
of
looking
at
it...
i
mean,
i,
when
i
read
it,
you
know,
i
thought
it's
just
redundant.
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
word
potential
is
in
there
in
order
to
accommodate
attempts.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
crawford,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
relationship
between
generic
burglary
and
what
florida
takes
as
sufficient
to
show
an
attempt?
and
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
issue
that
at
least
was
alluded
to
in
the
jones
case.
do
you
understand
florida
law
on
attempted
burglary
to
be
as
follows:
that
there
must
be
an
overt
act
taken
toward
entering
either
a
dwelling
or
a
structure,
as
distinct
from
an
overt
act
taken
to
get
within
the
curtilage?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no
such
thing
as
attempted
entry
of
the
curtilage
as
an
attempt
offense
under
burglary
under
florida
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
when
you
say
dwelling
you
mean
dwelling
as
defined
to
include
curtilage.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
marcus,
do
you
agree
with
your
brother's
answer
to
my
last
question
that
there
would
be
an
attempt...
could
be
an
attempt
under
florida
law
simply
to
take
an
overt...
to
commit
an
overt
act
toward
entering
the
curtilage
as
distinct
from
entering
a
physical
dwelling
or
a
physical
structure?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
know
basically
what
florida
law
is?
i
mean,
is
that
the
best
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
literally,
i
take
it
then
if
someone
did
have
a
fence
around
the
house,
and
i,
i...
i
walked
from
the
sidewalk
onto
the
lawn
toward
the
fence,
with
the
intent
of
getting
over
the
fence,
that
would
qualify
then,
as
you
understand
it,
as
an
attempted
burglary
under
florida
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
be
true
if
i
simply
wanted
to
get
into
the...
if
my
intent
was
to
get
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
but
not
into
the
dwelling?
for
example,
you
know,
i
wanted
to
steal
the
apples
on
the
tree?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
qualify
as
attempted
burglary?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
give
you
a
pretty
tough
row
to
hoe,
in
saying
that
there
is
a
sufficient
potential
risk
of
the
sort
of
harm
that
qualifies
under
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
we...
didn't
we
also
go
further
and
say
one
reason
to
construe
it
that
way
is
we
don't
want
courts
to
have
to
be,
in
effect,
having
sort
of
subsidiary
collateral
trials
after
the
fact,
to
establish...
you
know...
the
facts
of
old
trials.
there
was
an
administrability
analysis
involved.
i
think
there
was.
yeah,
i
wrote
shepard.
and
i
think
that's
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe,
the
same
point,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
risk
of
harm
in
these
attempt
cases
is
characteristically
going
to
be
pretty
close
to
zero?
i
mean,
they're
not
in
the
house.
they're
just
on
the
ladder,
in
the
kind
of
examples
we've
been
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
say
the
potential
risk
is
the
potential
for
the
risk
of
the
harm
that
comes
from
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself.
i
mean,
there
is...
i
don't
want
to
overdo
it,
but
the
risk
of
harm
to
others
from
the...
from
the
step
on
the
ladder
is
zero,
if
you
consider
simply
the
act
itself
of
putting
the
ladder
up
against
the
building
and
taking
the
step.
it's
only
because
that
creates
the
potential
for
getting
inside
where
the
risk,
in
fact,
is
measurable.
i
mean,
we
know
there
are
cases
in
which
victims
get
shot
when
they
appear
in
the
course
of
burglaries,
but
the
risk
associated
with
the
mere
attempt
in
isolation
is
going
to
be
minuscule.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
agree
with
you.
but
the
act
that
involved...
the
act
that
constitutes
the...
that
qualifies
for
the
attempt
doesn't
involve
it.
i'm--
trying
to
help
you
here.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
do
you
say
about
your
brother's
argument
that
the
statistics
show
there's
a
3
percent
chance,
i
think
it
was
a
3
percent
chance
of
violence
in
the
course
of
committing
the
burglary?
i
take
it
there
isn't
any
statistic
available,
if
we
want
to
take
justice
breyer's
approach,
about
the
potential...
the
actual
proven
potential
for
violence
at
the
near
attempt
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't
think
you
do
either,
but
i
mean,
i
think
your
whole
argument
has
got
to
rest
really
on
the
potential
for
harm
in
the
commission
of
the
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
marcus,
assuming
we
accept
your
view
about
the
way
the
statute
should
be
read,
i
take
it
you
agree
that
because
of
the
curtilage
possibility
under
florida
law,
that
florida
law,
that
burglary
in
florida
is
not
a
generic
burglary?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
my...
so
that
leads
me
to
this
question,
because...
i
mean,
i,
my
understanding
is
it's
not
a
generic
burglary.
therefore,
even
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
an
attempted
burglary
in
florida
doesn't
necessarily
satisfy
the
prong,
and
it's
got
to
come
in
under
the
residuary
clause,
of
course.
and
because
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
only
burglary
charged
was
a
burglary
of
the
curtilage,
we've
got
to...
don't
we
have
to
send
the
thing
back
to
find
out
either
from
court
records
whether
something
more
than
a
mere
penetration
of
curtilage
was
involved
here?
and
if
so,
whether...
whether
that
penetration
carried
with
it
the
potential
for
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
only
thing
we
know
under
the
otherwise
clause,
is
that
this
was
an
attempt
at
burglary.
if
the
burglary
were
a
generic
burglary,
your
analysis,
if
we
accept
it,
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
this
is
not
a
generic
burglary.
therefore,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
attempt
in
this
case
could
have
been
nothing
more
than
stepping
across
the
grass,
moving
toward
the
fence,
to
lean
over
to
take
the
apple.
and
therefore,
don't
we
have
to
go
to
court
records?
in
other
words,
don't
we
have
to
take
advantage
of
the
qualification
in
shepard
and
taylor
before
this
case
can
finally
be
decided?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
don't
have
any
transcript
of
colloquies
with
the
court
or
anything
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
following
sort
of
summary
fair:
because
florida
is
not
a
generic
burglary
state,
the
mere
conviction
of
burglary
would
not
satisfy
the
burglary
prong
in
subsection
2?
but
on
your
argument,
even
though
florida
is
not
a
generic
burglary
state,
an
attempted
burglary
will
always
satisfy
the
"otherwise"
prong;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
argument?
