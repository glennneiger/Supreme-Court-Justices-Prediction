mr.
craig
l.
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
confront
today
the
eleventh
circuit's
troubling
interpretation
of
the
otherwise
clause
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
under
the
text
and
structure
of
the
act,
as
well
as
the
categorical
approach
that
this
court
recognized
in
shepard
and
taylor,
florida
attempted
burglary
convictions
should
not
qualify
as
they...
these
types
of
convictions
do
not
involve
explicitly,
implicitly
or
even
inherently,
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
the
respondent
in
their
brief
has
enunciated
a
test
to
determine
whether
a
conviction
should
qualify,
and
that
test
that
they
enunciate
is
basically
a
district
court
judge
or
a
sentencing
judge
uses
their
common
sense
and
experience
to
determine
whether
an
offense
should
qualify.
that
type
of
test
is
not
the
kind
of
test
that
this
court
enunciated
in
taylor
and
shepard
when
it
looked
at
the
very
elemental
approach
at
determining
whether
convictions
should
qualify.
the
categorical
approach
that
this
court
enunciated
refers
to
predicate
offenses
in
terms
not
of
prior
conduct
but
of
prior
convictions
and
the
elements
of
those
crimes.
as
such,
the
government's
argument
would
open
up
a...
is
a
broad
mandate
that
courts
could
use
to
bring
in
almost
any
type
of
crime,
any
kind
of
felony
to
be
included
within
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
for
instance,
simple
possession
of
cocaine
is
a
third-degree
felony
in
florida.
it's
a
five-year
statutory
maximum.
under
the
serious
drug
offense
that
congress
enumerated,
it
would
only
qualify
if
it
had
a
10-year
statutory
maximum
and
it
involved
the
distribution
of
drugs.
yet,
if
the
government's
approach
to
the
interpretation
of
the
otherwise
clause
is
to
be
used,
that
simple
possession
of
cocaine
could
qualify
if
a
judge
using
their
common
sense
and
everyday
experience
determines
it
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
obviously--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--your
honor,
in
taylor,
this
court
was
clear
that
under
enumerated
burglary
or
generic
burglary,
the
offense
becomes
a...
has
that
serious
potential
risk
when
the
person
actually
enters
the
dwelling
or
enters
the
structure;
and
under
an
attempted
burglary,
at
least
in
florida
and
in
most
other
states,
that
act
has
not
occurred.
you
haven't
entered,
the
defendant
has
not
entered
the
property.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
if
the
conduct...
again,
we're
looking
at,
then,
a
fact-based
inquiry.
obviously,
some
attempted
burglaries
could
get
that
far.
other
attempted
burglaries
are
caught
well
before
that
actually
occurs.
but
if
you
were
to
say
that
the
attempted
burglary
was
climbing
up
a
ladder
trying
to
get
into
the
place
and
the
person
actually
didn't
get
in,
again,
under
taylor,
it
says
the
risk
is
when
the
person
enters.
the
risk
is
much
less
outside
the
dwelling
than
inside
the
dwelling.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
the
curtilage
is
a
unique
concept,
i
guess
in
florida,
in
that
the
curtilage
is
the
enclosed
space
around
the
house
that
has
some
kind
of
enclosure,
whether
by
fence
or
whether
by
bushes.
so
if
the
place
was
enclosed
and
you
had
a
ladder
going
up
to
the
residence,
that
would
actually
be
a
burglary
within
the
state
of
florida.
in
other
states,
it
may
not.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
well,
it
would
be
a
burglary
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
under
the
test
enunciated
in
taylor,
it
wouldn't
qualify
because
taylor
was
very
specific.
it
is
the
entering
a
dwelling
or
structure.
and
in
florida,
you
could
be
guilty
of
a
burglary
without
entering
a
structure
or
dwelling,
just
like
in
a
curtilage
burglary.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
well,
trying
to
use
the
court's
words
in
taylor,
taylor
talked
about
that--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--okay.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
if
you
started
up
the
ladder
and
that's
the
way
the
attempted
burglary
conviction
came
down,
it
would
be
a
lot
closer
call
to
say
that
would
be
a
potential
risk.
whether
it's
a
serious
potential
risk
under
taylor,
it
is
not
as
clear.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
that's
the
way
that
we
submit
it
has
to
be
done,
and
you
wouldn't
be
getting
to
those
facts.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
i
think
i
understand.
that
substantial
step
in
even
taking
a
step
up
the
ladder,
mr.
james
would
submit
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
would
not
qualify
and
would
not
create
that
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
of
those
four,
extortion
does
seem
to
potentially
have
the
least
risk
of
all
those
crimes
enumerated.
but--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--a
potential
risk--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--in
the
government's...
in
the
respondent's
brief,
they
talked
about
how
risk
and
potential
and
serious,
some
of
those
worlds
potentially
knock
each
other
out,
and
i
apologize
for
using
that
very
word,
but--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--i
think
it
is
a
risk.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
if
that
were
true,
i
mean,
congress
when
they
wrote
the
statute,
and
in
924(e)(2)(b)(ii),
or
(e)(2)(b)(ii)(1),
they
specifically
enumerated
attempted
crimes
to
qualify
under
that
violence.
so
it
has
an
element,
use
of
or
attempted
use
of,
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
but
under
prong
two,
they
specifically
deleted
that
word
"attempt".
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
they
did
not
include
it,
and
under--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--in
1984
actually,
there
was
a
proposal
where
burglary
would
qualify
and
attempted
burglary
would
qualify.
that
was
passed
by
the
senate,
never
passed
by
the
house,
never
enacted.
so
later
on
when
burglary
was
actually
defined,
burglary
was
defined
as
the
type
of
burglary
that
taylor
came
close
to
defining
the
same
way.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
if
that
were
the
only
way
to
prove
an
attempted
burglary
within
a
state,
if
that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
requirement,
the
legal
requirement
that
you
have
to
put
the
ladder
against
the
house
and
that's
an
element
of
the
offense,
that
to
me
would
be
a
much
closer
call;
but
still,
under
the
analysis
that
we
have
provided
the
court
with
the
russello
presumption,
it
should
not
qualify.
but
it
is
a
closer
case.
whereas
categorically
when
you
look
at
attempted
burglaries,
the
putting
the
ladder
against
the
side
of
the
house
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
correct.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
it
is
an
overt
act
that
is
beyond
mere
thinking
about
it.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
well,
it's
not
really
a
step
analysis,
a
substantial
step
analysis.
it
is
an
overt
act.
it's
some
overt
act
manifesting
your
intent
to
actually--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--if
you
had
a
diagram
of
the
person's
house
and
you
had
burglary
tools
in
your
car
and
you
had
maybe
even
called
to
make
sure
the
business
was
closed
and
you
were
driving
there
and
as
you're
driving
there
you're
telling
the
person
sitting
beside
you:
i'm
going
to
break
into
that,
you
know,
business
at
254
main
street.
that
would
be
enough
under
florida
law
to
convict
someone
for
attempted
burglary
of
a
structure.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
that
may
be...
that
may
be
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer,
and
maybe
the
respondent
had
that
obligation
in
the
district
court,
because
they
have
the
obligation
to
prove
that
this
enhancement
has
that
substantial
or
that
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another
and
of
course
they
didn't
do
that.
but
if
you
look
back
in
this
court's
decision
in
1985
in
tennessee
versus
garner,
this
court
was
talking
about
completed
burglaries
and
it
talked
about
physical
violence
to
a
person
would
only
occur
in
a
rare
case,
and
it
gave
the
percentage
i
think
of
3.6
or
3.8
percent
of
the
time.
but
that's
in
a
completed
burglary.
that's
not
even
talking
about
an
attempted
burglary,
what's
the
risk--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--i
think
it
can
be
read
either
way,
although
i
think
even
the
government's
brief
in...
or
the
respondent's
brief
in
taylor
talks
about
extortion
and
burglary
being
crimes
that
can
be
committed
with
no
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another
person
and
yet
congress
still
specifically
enumerated
those--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--using
that
analysis,
it's
hard
to
figure
out,
but
again
the
government
had
this
obligation
or
we
submit
the
government
had
this
obligation,
and
they've
not
shown
an
attempted
burglary
to
be
any
more
dangerous.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
in
florida,
or
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
they
have
determined
that
conspiracy
to
commit
enumerated
offenses
do
present
that
serious
potential
risk.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
so
in
the
eleventh
circuit
they
have
determined
that.
but
again,
we
submit
under
that
russello
presumption
or
even
the
statute
itself,
congress
enumerated
those
four
property
crimes,
primarily
property
crimes.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
they
both
present
very
little
potential
risk.
they
don't
even
really...
under
a
serious
potential
risk,
they
don't
present
that.
a
conspiracy
shouldn't
either.
a
conspiracy
and
attempt
are
not
different
things
because
a
conspiracy
doesn't
qualify--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--i
believe
the
eleventh
circuit
is
wrong
with
conspiracy
as
well.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
well,
the
sentencing
commission
when
they
were
interpreting
the
career
offender
statute,
or
guidelines,
they
were
looking
at
a
guideline
that
is
worded
different
than
the--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--well,
they
came
to
that
conclusion
dealing
with
whether
a
career
offender
provision
should
include
attempted
burglary
not
under
the
armed
career
criminal
statute
and
they
specifically
recognized
that.
moreover,
when
they
dealt
with
whether
they
wanted
to
include
attempted
burglary,
they
were
dealing
with
career
offender,
which
has,
although
it
increases
the
guideline
range
a
person
can
be
sentenced
to,
it
certainly
doesn't
increase
the
statutory
maximum
in
zero
to
10
year
offense
to
a
15
years
to
life
offense.
so
for
those
reasons,
even
if
the
sentencing
commission
feels
that
the
career
offender
statute
or
guideline
should
include
attempted
burglary,
that
doesn't
mean
this
court
should
use
that
for
the
armed
career
criminal
statute.
moreover,
the
career
offender
statute
says
it's
only
a
burglary
of
a
dwelling,
although
the
armed
career
criminal
statute
says
a
burglary
qualifies
if
it's
a
dwelling
or
a
structure.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
well,
taylor
and
shepard
both
talk
about
that
predicate
offenses
under
924(e)
should
be
looked
at
in
a...
using
a
categorical
approach,
and
the
court
has
talked
about
that
being
an
approach
looking
to
the
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
it
didn't
specifically
refer
to
the
residual
category.
but
even
in
shepard--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--if
the
court
were
to
step
back
and
say
that
the
mr.
james'
case
there
are
no
facts,
so
it
may
not
make
any
difference
for
him
because
there's
no
facts
to
indicate
what
kind
of
burglary
really
occurred
here.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
correct.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
that
is
correct.
there
were
facts
that
were
presented
in
the
presentence
report
that
came
from
police
reports.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
actually,
no.
those
crimes,
attempted
crimes,
also
should
not
come
in
unless
there's
something
about
an
attempted
arson
statute
that
has
as
an
element
or
something
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another,
which
at
least
in
florida
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
getting
back
to
your
question,
maybe
this
answers
part
of
it:
although
the
court...
you
asked,
justice
scalia,
you
asked
a
question
about
why
can't
we
make
this
basically
maybe
a
fact-based
inquiry.
and
if
you
were
to
do
so,
the
whole
categorical
approach
that
we're
dealing
with
in
all
the
other
sections
would
almost
become
irrelevant
because
if
something
doesn't
apply
categorically,
then
we'll
go
to
a
fact-based
inquiry
and
that
kind
of
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
the
categorical
approach.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
the
plea
colloquy
was
not
ever
presented
or
produced,
and
it
does
show
that
they
came
from
police
reports.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
i
believe
that
is
stated
in
the
psr
regarding
the
facts
that
they
alleged
under
the
attempted
burglary,
which
again
were
objected
to.
specifically,
the
facts
weren't
necessarily
objected
to,
but
the
use
of
the
attempted
burglary
was
objected
to,
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
took
that
as
being
an
objection
to
using
anything
regarding
the
attempted
burglary.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
the
evidence...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
little
me
briefly
answer
this
question.
or...
i
want
to
remain,
or
let
some
remain
for
my
rebuttal.
very
quickly,
the
overt
act
has
to
refer
to
the
attempting
to
enter
the
dwelling.
and
so--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--under
florida
law
attempting
to
enter
the
curtilage
is
an
attempted
burglary;
it
is
the
same
thing.
dwelling
is
defined
as
the
building
or
the
curtilage.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
correct.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
thank
you.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
it
seems
to
me
that
respondent's
position
is
taking
the
"otherwise"
clause
to
trump
the
entire
rest
of
the
statute.
any
crime,
any
felony,
has
a
potential
of
violence.
in
fact,
in
footnote
9
of
the
reply
brief
we
cited
the
golden
opinion
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
in
that
particular
opinion
the
court
found
that
serious
potential
risk
for
someone
who
failed
to
report
to
a
jail
because
they
speculate,
you
know,
law
enforcement
might
have
to
go
and
arrest
them
and
there
could
be
violence
in
that
situation.
well,
that
happens
in
all
crimes,
the
potential
for
law
enforcement
to
arrest
somebody.
there's
always
a
potential
for
violence.
so
the
government's
position--
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
--but
there's
still
the
same
potential
for
violence
in
either
one
of
those.
mr.
craig
l.
crawford
for
someone
who's
escaped.
golden
wasn't
dealing
with
that.
golden
was
dealing
with
someone
who
failed
to
report
to
a
facility
after
being
sentenced
to
do
so.
the
same
could
be
said
for
someone
failing
to
report
to
a
court
for
a
hearing.
a
bench
warrant
is
issued.
the
same
type
of
risk
would
be
inherent
in
that
type
of...
for
that
person
as
for
someone
who
fails
to
report
to
a
jail
upon
being
sentenced.
all
of
those
potential
crimes,
basically
that
would
leave
open
any
potential
felony
to
qualify
under
the
"otherwise"
prong.
congress
obviously
couldn't
have
intended
that.
moreover,
there's
still
an
issue
that
was
brought
up
in
shepard
on
the
constitutional
avoidance.
how
do
we
actually
make
these
determinations
and
are
these
necessarily
determinations
that
were
found
by
the
florida
court
or
by
the
florida
system
for
a
florida
attempted
burglary
conviction?
we
submit
it's
not.
and
you're
going
beyond
the
mere
fact
of
the
prior
conviction.
you're
looking
at
many
other
components,
the
risk
of
the
conviction,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
mere
fact
of
the
prior
conviction.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
