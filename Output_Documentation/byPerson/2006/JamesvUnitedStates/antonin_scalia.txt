justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
analyze
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
this
defendant
started
up
the
ladder.
as
i
understand,
you
would...
you
have
to
analyze
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
generically
attempted
burglary
as
a
whole
presents
a
serious
enough
risk;
isn't
that
the
way
it
has
to
be
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if
it
would,
that's
only
one
manner
of
attempt.
and
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
going
to
do
it
generically,
you
have
to
look
over
the
whole
scope
of
possible
attempts
and
say
does
the
whole
scope
of
possible
attempts
bear,
i
would
say,
a
similar
risk
of
the
use
of
physical
force
as
do
the
specifically
mentioned
crimes
of
burglary,
arson
or
extortion?
indeed,
i
guess
you
have
to
use
the
least
dangerous.
wouldn't
you
say
extortion
is
probably,
of
those
mentioned
crimes,
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
or
the
use
of
explosives,
or
otherwise
involves
conduct.
now
that
"otherwise",
that
refers
me
back
to
the
crimes
already
mentioned,
and
i
would
say
that
means
that
the
unnamed
crime
has
to
have
a
similar
risk,
at
least
a
risk
as
high
as
the
least
dangerous
of
the
crimes
mentioned,
which
i
would
take
to
be
extortion.
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
a
potential
risk,
by
the
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
potential
potential?
i
mean,
every
risk
is
potential,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
potential
risk
is
just
risk
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
also
keep
the
professors
from
other
mischief.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we
have
to
decide
how
many
attempts
involve
that
kind
of
initial
action,
which
doesn't
seem
very
physical
threatening,
and
how
many
of
them
involve
putting
a
ladder
up
against
the
side
of
the
house.
how
do
we
possibly
figure
that
out,
to
decide
whether
as
a
whole
the
degree
of
risk
from
attempted
burglary
is
as
high
as
at
least
the
degree
of
risk
from
extortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
crawford,
if
you
had
that
meaning
in
mind,
you
would
not
have
used
the
word
"otherwise".
you
would
have
simply
said
is
burglary,
arson
or
extortion,
involves
the
use
of
explosives,
or
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk.
the
other
purpose
of
the
"otherwise",
which
means
in
some
other
manner,
some
other
manner...
other
from
what?
other
from
the
preceding
ones.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
sensible
way
to
read
it
except,
you
know,
in
some
other
manner
than
these
previously
named
crimes
involves
a
physical
risk;
and
that
is
what
causes
me
to
say,
well,
what's
the
least
dangerous
of
the
previously
mentioned
crimes,
and
any
crime
you
want
to
get
into
this
residual
category
has
to
be
at
least
as
dangerous
as
that.
as
i've
said,
i
think
that's
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
crawford,
we've
held
that
the
named
crimes
have
to
be
considered
generically
according
to
their
elements,
right?
burglary,
arson.
have
we
ever
held
that
the
residual
category
or
"otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
"
that
that
has
to
be
decided
generically?
i
mean,
if
we
could
apply
that
residual
category,
not
generically
but
according
to
the
crime
that
was
actually
tried
and
of
which
the
defendant
has
been
convicted,
such
as
laying
a
ladder
up
against
the
house,
that
particular
sort
of
burglary,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
much
easier,
much
easier
case,
wouldn't
it?
we'd
be
able
to
tell
whether
there
was
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury.
is
there
any
obstacle
to
doing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
referring
to
the
residual
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it's
not
too
late
to
save
ourselves
from
sending
out
legions
of
law
professors
to
do
studies.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
attempted
use
of
explosives
is
at
least
as
dangerous
as
extortion?
i
mean
as
far
as
the
risk
of
physical
injury
is
concerned,
i
would
think
attempted
use
of
explosives
is
much
more
dangerous
to
physical
health
than
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
marcus,
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
do
that
with
respect
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
crime
than
it
is
to
do
it
generically...
you
know...
picking
out
attempted
burglary.
it
is
very
hard
to
do
that.
why
shouldn't
we
read
this,
this
residual
category
to
refer
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
crime
of
which
the
defendant
has
been
convicted?
the
language
enables
you
to
do
that.
the
term
violent
felony
means
any
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year
that
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury,
physical
injury
to
another.
why
can't
we
not,
not
interpret
that
to
mean
generic
crime,
but
rather
the
particular
crime
of
which
this
defendant
stands
convicted?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
fine
if
burglary
were
the
only
thing
that
congress
said
there,
but
it
also
said
extortion.
and
i
think
it
absolutely
fanciful
to
believe
that
extortion
characteristically...
characteristically...
involves
a
risk
of
physical
harm.
i
just
don't
think
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
is
the
criterion
"characteristically",
or
is
the
criterion
whatever
minimal
risk
of
harm
there
is
in
extortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
level
of
potential
risk
the
level
that
exists
in
extortion?
right?
that's
what
the
otherwise
refers
you
to.
