justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
were
looking
at
attempted
generic
burglary
of
a
residence,
wouldn't
that
involve
conduct
that
presents
the
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
would-be
burglar
is
climbing
through
the
window
or
on
a
ladder
with
the
intent
to
climb
through
the
window,
wouldn't
that
involve
almost
the
same
risk
or
maybe
the
same
risk?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
crawford,
does
the
record
show
that
the
facts
in
the
psr
came
from
police
reports
rather
than
from
a
plea
colloquy
or
someplace
in
the
court
records?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
a
number
of
florida
cases
that
involve
open
carports.
how
would
you
apply
it
there?
somebody,
if
you
had
a
carport
that's
not
fenced
off
at
all,
just
20
feet
let's
say
from
the
street,
somebody
walks
into
the
carport
and
steals
a
garden
rake?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
in
measuring
the
risk,
you
should
consider
not
just
what
this
particular
defendant
succeeded
in
accomplishing,
but
what
the
defendant
was
attempting
to
accomplish?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner
alphonso
james
pleaded
guilty
in
federal
court
to
possessing
a
firearm
after
being
convicted
of
the
felony.
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
or
acca,
james
was
subject
to
a
mandatory
sentence
of
15
years
if
he
had
three
prior
convictions
for
a
violent
felony
or
a
serious
drug
offense.
because
james
had
two
prior
drug
convictions
whether
he
received
the
mandatory
minimum
turned
on
whether
the
third
prior
conviction
for
attempted
burglary
under
florida
law
qualified
as
a
violent
felony.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
did
and
we
affirm.
the
provision
of
acca
at
issue
18
u.
s.
c.
section
924
(e)(2)(b)(ii)
defines
a
violent
felony
to
include
burglary,
arson
or
extortion,
crimes
that
involve
the
use
of
explosives
or
offenses
that
“otherwise
involve
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
in
taylor
v.
united
states
we
held
that
in
evaluating
an
offense
under
acca
we
look
not
to
the
actual
conduct
of
the
defendant
in
the
case
at
hand
but
rather
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
convicted.
under
this
categorical
approach
we
turned
to
florida
law
to
determine
whether
it
defines
attempted
burglary
in
such
a
way
that
it
provides
the
requisite
serious
threat
of
physical
injury.
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
attempted
burglary
under
florida
law
defendant
must
commit
an
overt
act
directed
toward
entering
or
remaining
in
a
structure.
mere
preparation
like
casing
a
neighborhood
or
obtaining
burglars’
tools
is
not
enough
in
determining
whether
attempted
burglary
as
defined
by
florida
law
poses
the
requisite
risk
under
acca.
we
can
look
to
whether
it
presents
risks
comparable
posed
by
the
most
analogues
of
the
enumerated
offenses
here
actual
burglary.
both
attempted
burglary
and
completed
burglary
pose
the
same
sort
of
risk
which
arises
not
from
the
completion
of
the
braking
but
rather
from
the
chance
that
some
third
party
whether
a
homeowner
police
officer
or
pacifier
might
witness
the
crime
in
progress
and
attempt
to
intervene
resulting
in
a
physical
confrontation
with
would
be
burglar.
this
risk
is
present
when
the
defendant
is
at
the
doorstep
as
well
as
after
the
defendant
has
gained
entry.
indeed
the
risk
posed
by
attempted
burglary
may
even
be
greater
than
that
posed
by
completed
burglary.
all
burglaries
begin
as
attempts
and
when
the
attempt
fails
to
ripe
in
into
completion
it
is
often
because
some
outside
party
intervened.
of
course,
one
can
imagine
some
attempted
burglaries
that
would
not
pose
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury
for
example,an
unarmed
burglar
entering
a
remote
an
unoccupied
house
that
acca
does
not
require
certainty
only
a
potential
risk
of
serious
physical
injury.
the
proper
question
is
whether
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
element
of
the
offense
in
the
ordinary
case
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
another,
attempted
burglary
meets
the
standard.
we
therefore
conclude
that
attempted
burglary
as
defined
by
florida
law
qualifies
as
a
violent
felony
under
acca
and
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
