justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
anybody...
you
know,
count.
it
sounds
to
me
if
you're
wondering
about
whether
there's
a
specific
serious
risk
of
harm,
you
could
find
out.
look
at
the
conviction
that
in
florida
for
attempted
burglary,
look
at
the
convictions
for
burglary,
and
see
if
the
harm
involved,
the
number
of
cases
in
which
people
are
harmed
is
roughly
similar.
we
have
all
these
law
professors
who
like
statistics.
now
they
like
law
in
economics
and
everything.
so
why
don't
they
go
out
there
and
count,
and
then
we'd
actually
know,
instead
of
sitting
here
and
trying
to
figure
out
something
i
know
nothing
about.
i've
never
been
involved
in
a
lot
of
burglaries.
i
don't
know
how
the
burglaries
operate.
i
suspect
some
people
are
hurt,
but
rather
than
my
suspicion
why
don't
we
find
out
what
the
facts
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
wouldn't
it
be,
as
a
method
of
approaching--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
don't
know
and
if
i
can't
get
too
far
with
the
language
and
i
frankly
could
sit
in
my
office
looking
at
the
computer
screen
i
think
for
hours
and
i
wouldn't
be
closer
to
knowing
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
lot
of
injury
that
accompanies
attempted
burglary,
but
that
is
something
that
is
possible
to
know.
all
we
have
to
do,
as
i
said
before,
is
count
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
can
do
that.
in
fact,
there
are
people
who
at
least
have
a
mandate
to
do
it
and
that
is
the
sentencing
commission.
so
they
have
the
tools.
they
have
the
ability.
and
so
in
the
absence
on
a
question
like
this
of
my
being
able
to
get
anywhere
by
cogitating
about
the
language
and
in
a
borderline
case
where
it
isn't
obvious,
why
don't
we
as
a
court
simply
follow
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
in
the
absence
of
better
information
from
some
other
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
trying
to
find
out
the
same
answer
to
the
same
kind
of
question:
how
many
of
these
attempted
burglaries,
how
many
burglaries,
how
many
other
crimes
are
accompanied
by
an
individual
being
hurt?
and
as
i
say,
i
cannot
imagine
how
to
answer
that
question
in
a
borderline
case
without
trying
to
find
the
numbers,
which
i
don't
have
here,
and
therefore
since
i
don't
have
them,
why
don't
i
look
to
the
best,
second
best
alternative,
which
is
at
least
they
could
get
them,
and
i
hope
they
did
get
them
before
coming
to
the
conclusion
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
an
ordinary
city
street
in
miami
walking
along
the
street,
there
are
a
lot
of
houses,
and
there's
a
little
bit
of
lawn
or
bushes
in
front,
and
there's
not
a
fence,
because
there
isn't,
or
there
aren't
fences
in
many
city
blocks,
a
person
goes
up
to
the
house
and
starts
to
monkey
around
with
the
window
to
raise
it
or
whatever,
that's
attempted
burglary,
not
burglary,
in
florida?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
i
doubt...
then
again
i'm
left
at
sea.
i
don't
know
how
often
that
happens
or
is
dangerous.
so
if
i
think
that
this
is
really
a
statistical
question,
and
i
think
maybe
it
is...
and
the
government
is
in
the
best
position,
they
have
all
the
statistics,
they
have
whole
bureaus
over
there.
so
what
about
a
presumption
against
the
government?
in
a
case
where
it
seems
to
be
a
close
case
and
it
is
a
statistical
question,
and
the
government
doesn't
have
any
statistics?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
you
supposed
to
decide
it
if
there's
a
question
as
there
is
this
instance
i
think?
i
just
don't
know
how
dangerous
attempted
burglaries
are.
i
mean,
maybe
i'm
not
supposed
to
admit
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
don't
know
but
there
are.
and
this
is
one
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
the
text
several
times.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
and
here
i
think
it
might
be
less
than
burglary.
and
extortion,
though
one
thinks
of
somebody
writing
a
poison
pen
letter
or
something
and
revealing
a
secret
from
the
past...
many
such
crimes
are
threats
of
violence.
i
mean,
and
that
just
read
through
the
statutes,
and
that's
what
they
are
aiming
at.
so
i
would
say
extortion
is
something
that
quite
often
could
involve
violence.
but
again
that's
cogitating.
so
i
get
to
attempted
burglary.
i
don't
know.
now
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
attempted
assault?
i
bet
nobody
has
ever
been
hurt
in
an
attempted
assault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
it
wouldn't
fit
within
your...
i
mean,
i
just
wonder
what
happens
when
you
try
to
get
away
from
numbers.
maybe
there
are
a
certain
number
of
people
injured
during
mail
fraud
or
embezzlement,
you
know,
some
people
get
annoyed
during
an
embezzlement
and
start
hitting
each
other.
i
can't
get
away
from
the
numbers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
test?
the
test
is
either
a
high
statistical
number
of
injuries
or
if
not,
a
nexus
to
a
crime
that
does
have
a
high
statistical
number
of
injuries?
i
like
the
word
nexus
because
whenever
i
see
it
in
an
opinion,
i
have
no
idea
what
it
means.
[laughter]
