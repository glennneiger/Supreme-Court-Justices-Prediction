we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
in
time
to
decide
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader

but
what
do
we
know
about
the
dimensions
of
the
florida
attempt
crime?
for
example,
you
have
said
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
possess
burglary
tools.
does
it
mean
or
does
it
exclude
casing
the
house,
walking
up
and
down
the
street,
around
the
block?
when
is
a
step
substantial
enough
to
constitute
an
attempt
under
florida
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
that
concretely?
it's
not
possessing
burglar's
tools,
it's
not
casing
the
place.
what
qualifies
as
an
overt
act
that
would
make
one
guilty
of
the
crime
of
attempted
burglary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
you
agree,
mr.
marcus,
that
this
court's
decision
in
shepard
excludes
that
interpretation?
if
you
look
at
the
particular
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
there's
some
cases
in
this
large
category
that
clearly
wouldn't
involve
any
risk
to
anybody.
say
the
enterprising
but
careful
burglar
who
keeps
watch
for
several
days
to
see
when
no
one
is
in
the
house,
that
that's
when
he
chooses
to
make
his
entry.
