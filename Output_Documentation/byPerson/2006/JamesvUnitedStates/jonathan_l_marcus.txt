mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner's
conviction
for
attempted
burglary
of
a
dwelling
under
florida
law
is
a
violent
felony
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
because
like
the
crime
of
burglary
petitioner's
crime
categorically
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes,
while
i
would
disagree
with
that,
but
while
there
are...
with
your
characterization.
but
there
are
no...
the
number
of
reported
cases
involving
an
attempted
burglary
that
involved
an
attempt
to
get
on
to
the
curtilage,
if...
i
think...
based
on--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
i
don't,
i
don't
think
you
could
conclude,
they
have...
there
is
no
decision
telling
you
whether
that
would
suffice.
but
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
it
could
not
involve
an
attempted
entry
into
the
curtilage.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes...
it
could.
it
could--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
think
it
could.
i
think...
but
i
think
you--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
mean
florida,
in
the
state
versus
hamilton
case,
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
florida
has
defined
curtilage
narrowly,
strictly
construed
the
word
curtilage
narrowly,
to
limit
that
concept
to
an
enclosed
area
that
immediately
surrounds
the
dwelling.
and
the
case
discusses
a
couple
of
cases
from
various
florida
courts
of
appeals
where
the
courts
construed
the
concept
of
curtilage
and
held
that
in
one
case
it
was
marijuana
that
was
quite
a
distance
away
from
the,
from
a
dwelling
house,
in
another
case
a
whiskey
still
that
was
a
distance
about
50
yards
away
from
the
dwelling
house,
that
those
were
too
far
out
to
be
considered
part
of
the
curtilage,
part
of
that
area
that
immediately
surrounds
the
dwelling
that's
associated
with
the
intimate
activities
of
the
dwelling.
so
florida...
and
florida...
and
i
think
the
court
should
take
the
florida
supreme
court
at
its
word
when
it
said
it's
going
to
strictly
construe
that
concept,
and
when
it
said
it's
not
going
to
construe
it
to
produce
absurd,
harsh
or
unreasonable
results,
keeping
in
mind
how
serious
the
offense
of
burglary
is.
so
i
think
the...
so
the
first
step,
i
think,
if
you
don't...
if
you
don't
believe
that
the
way
florida
defines
burglary
is
generic
in
the
way
congress
had
in
mind,
i
don't
think
you
could
conclude
that
it
presents
a
categorically
different
set
of
risks
such
that
it
would
even
fall
outside
the
otherwise
clause.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
under
the
current,
i
think
under
the
current
statute,
it
has
been
amended
since,
since
1993
and
'94,
and...
which
is
relevant,
the
statute
is
relevant
to
this
case.
i
think
now
carports
are
considered
part
of
the
dwelling
itself,
the
structure
itself
but
under...
but
if
it...
but
under
the
florida's
concept
of
curtilage
if
the
area
was
not
enclosed,
it
was
not
enclosed
by
a
fence
or
other
structure
it
would
not
be
considered
part
of
the
curtilage.
and
in
fact,
the
state
versus
hamilton
case,
it
cited
a
case
that
cast
a
doubt
on
a
prior
case
that
had
found
a
burglary
that
took
place
on
a
driveway,
and
noted
that
the
court
in
that
case
hadn't
determined
whether
the
area,
whether
the
driveway
was
enclosed.
so
it
does...
the
statute
does...
the
concept
does
require
an
enclosure
and
the
area
immediately
surrounding
the
dwelling
and
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
that,
that
defined
in
that
way,
in
that
limited
way,
that
someone
who's
intending
to
get
on
to
a
residence
into
the
area
either
in
or
right
around
the
dwelling,
that
that
person
is
not
sort
of
categorically
dangerous
kind
of
person
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
set
out
burglary
as
one
of
the
paradigmatic
offenses
in
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that...
yes.
that
is
my
understanding.
if
it
was
not
enclosed.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think...
i
don't
think
when
congress
enacted
this
law
that
it
expected
the
courts
would
have
statistics
available
to--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
there
are
several
things
you
can
do.
first
you
can
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
congress
provided
some
guidance
by
setting
out
four
examples
of
crimes
that
do
present
the
type
of
risk
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think...
i
think
you
have
to
consider
what
congress's
purpose...
in
enacting
the
statute,
congress
directed
your
attention
to
the
serious
potential
risk
that
an
offense
presents.
i
think
that
just...
and
criminal
law
requires
courts
and
juries
all
the
time
to
take
into
account
and
to
use
their
common
sense
and
experience
to
judge
the
risks
that
are
presented
by
a
particular
crime.
i
mean,
the
very
concept
of
recklessness
itself
refers
to
a
substantial
disregard
of--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
all
that...
this
law
has
been
interpreted
for
many
years.
no
courts
of
appeals
have,
have
construed
that
it
way.
they
have
construed
it
to
require
a
categorical
approach.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
provision,
congress
clearly
with
respect
to
the
listed
offenses
had
in
mind
a
sort
of
a
categorical
approach
that,
while
these
courts
had,
sort
of
looking
at
one
of
these
crimes
on
an
ex
post
basis,
it
might
not
present
any
risk,
the
idea
that
these
crimes
categorically
present
a
potential...
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
the
court
referred
both
in
taylor
and
shepard
to
the...
to
congress's
approach.
and
under
the
statute,
that
sort
of
that
it
wants
you
to
take
a
categorical
approach
to
crimes
that
are
inherently
presented--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--there
was
that
as
well.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
beyond
the
ability
of
courts
to
take
a
crime,
look
at
the
elements
of
the
crime,
figure
out
what
conduct
is
necessary
to
satisfy
those
elements
and
then
use
common
sense
and
experience
to
make
a
judgment
about
how
that...
the
risks
that
are
posed
by
that
conduct.
looking
at
the
situation--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--and
either--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--no.
i
think
it's
not...
no
i
think
it
has
to,
characteristically
taken
at
a
general
level,
the
conduct
required
to
commit
a
burglary,
of
getting--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i
think
it
would.
first
of
all,
congress--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--the
statistics
he
is
referring
to
came
out
before
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1986
and
expanded
it
and
specifically
enumerated
burglary
as
one
of
the
crimes
that
it
thought
paradigmatically
presented
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
that
way
in
taylor...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
on
page...
on
page
597
of
taylor.
i
mean
this
court
said
that
congress's
choice
of
language
indicates
that
congress
thought
ordinary
burglaries
as
well
as
burglaries
involving
some
aspect
making
them
especially
dangerous,
presented
a
sufficiently
serious
potential
risk
to
count
toward
enhancement.
i
mean,
that's
right
in
the
taylor
decision,
and
i
think
that
has
got
to
be
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
because
why
did
congress
identify...
they
created
two
categories
of
violent
felonies.
the
first
is
with
respect
to
an
element
of
the
offense
that
goes
to
targeting
a
person
for
physical
harm.
the
second
category
are
those
crimes
that
don't
necessarily
target
a
person
for
physical
harm
but
necessarily
present,
inherently
present
a
risk
of
physical
injury
to
a
person.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
congress
identified
it
as
a
violent
felony
presumably
because
it
believed
it
had...
it
had
the
criteria.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
that
it
carries
the
potential
risk,
because
when
any...
when
someone
commits
extortion
there
might
be
a
tendency
to...
if
there--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
to
the
level
of
risk
that's
presented
by
any
of
the
preceding
examples.
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
the
statute
directs
you
to
consider
the
serious
potential
risk.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
when
you're
assessing
the
risk
presented
by
particular
conduct,
i
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
intent
that
goes
along
with
that
conduct.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
congress
doesn't
look
to
attempt
as
a
lesser
offense.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
vast
majority
of
provisions
in
the
u.s.
criminal
code
punish
the
attempt
the
same
as
for
the
completed
offense.
and
if
you
think
about
the
purpose
of
the
acca,
and
the
acca
is
not
focused
on
the
results
of
the
prior
crimes
of
the
armed
felon
committed,
it
is
focused
on
the
risk,
the
propensity
that
somebody
has,
has
demonstrated
by
engaging
in
at
least
three
prior
violent
felonies
or
serious
drug
offenses
to
engage
in
behavior
that
is
dangerous,
that
presents
dangers
to
public
safety.
so
if
you
think
about
the
attempt
and
the
whole
concept
of
attempt,
i
mean,
someone
who
has
committed
attempt
by
definition
has
intended
to
commit
the
offense
and
as
you
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
only
failed
by
reason
of
an
unforeseen
event.
why
would
congress
in
this
statute
want
to
differentiate
between
the
frustrated
burglar
whose
only...
who
hasn't
succeeded
only
by
virtue
of
an
unforeseen
event,
and
the
successful
burglar?
i
think
the
serious
potential
risk
language
allows
you
to
sort
of
look
at
the
attempt
as
you
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
virtually
the
equivalent--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--arguably.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
case
law,
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
furthest
out,
the
furthest
case
the
petitioner
can
find,
the
most
extreme
case
that
he's
found
involves
someone
who's
in
the
backyard
of
a
dwelling
reconnoitering
or
casing
the
dwelling,
and
that
was
the
most
extreme
example.
so
even
with
attempts,
you
find
in
all
the
case
law,
you
do
find
the
physical
proximity
to
the
premises.
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
it
wouldn't
succeed
is
because
somebody,
there's
the
presence
of
someone
who
frustrates
the
entry.
so
that
even
on
that
level,
at
that
level,
it
is
hard
to
say
that
there's
any
lower
risk
presented
by
the
attempt.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but
again,
i
think...
i
don't
think
you
need
to
have
those
statistics.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
the
very
reason
that
attempts
are
prohibited,
because
they
present
the
serious
potential
to
produce
the
harms
that
the
completed
offense
presents.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
for
attempts?
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes,
i
think
congress
wanted
to
treat
a
frustrated
burglar
the
same--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
they've
shown
the
same
propensity
to
engage
in
the
conduct
that
congress
was
concerned
about
that
falls
at
the
heart
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but
that's
not
what
we're
asking
the
court
here.
we're
asking
the
court
to
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
to
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense
to
see
whether
that
creates
a
situation
in
which
violence
is
likely
to
arise.
here
you're
talking
about,
this
is
attempted
burglary
of
a
dwelling
where
you
have--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--but
in
considering
the
conduct
involved
in
the
offense,
the
attempting
to
get,
the
attempt
to
enter
a
dwelling,
enter
someone's
home,
someone's
residence,
that
creates
a
dynamic
situation
in
which
violence
could
occur--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that
doesn't--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
but
again,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
statistics
would
show
that.
i
don't
think
logically
they
would
show
that
in
light
of
the
numbers
that
are
shown
for
completed
burglary.
but
again,
i
don't
see...
with
respect
to
the
offenses
that
are
covered
that
are
at
the
core
of
the
statute,
i
don't
see
why
you
would
distinguish
between
the
person
who
tried
to
get
in
but
was
frustrated
by
some
unforeseen
event.
they
have
created
the
same
set
of
risks,
they've
triggered
the
same
set
of
risks
that
the
successful
burglar
has.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
correct.
i
think
the
statute
permits
you
to
do
that
with
its
plain
language
of
focusing
on
the
potential
risk
of
the
conduct,
the
serious
potential
risk.
and
that...
and
also
in
looking
at
the
rationale
for
attempts
and
why
we
punish
attempts,
in
terms
of
the
person
is,
you
get
punished
for
attempts
because
you
sufficiently
manifested
your
dangerousness
in
the
same
way
as
someone
who's
completed
the
offense.
again,
the
state
codes,
the
vast
majority
of
state
codes
demonstrate
the
riskiness
of
attempt
behavior.
they
predicate
felony
murder
convictions
on
attempted
burglary
as
well
as
burglary.
and
as
i
said--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
i
think,
my
understanding
would
be
that
would
be
covered
under
the
first
subsection
for
the
use...
attempted
use
or
threat,
threatened
use
of
force.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
but
there
in
those
type
offenses,
if
you
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense,
there's
no
nexus
between
those
elements
and
the...
a
reaction
that
someone
might
have
just
to
being
prosecuted.
i
mean,
that's
not--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
in
this
statute
you're
talking
about
career
criminals,
people
who
have
committed
a
number
of
crimes
and
have
recently
just
been
convicted
of
being
an
armed
felon.
and
i
think
that's...
when
you
look
at...
that
can
be
your
starting
point,
and
take...
so
this
case
doesn't
present
questions
about
other
cases
that
might
present...
arguably
present,
or
present
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury,
but
don't
necessarily
seem
to
fit
with
the
crimes
that
are
listed
and
what
the
crimes
that
congress
had
in
mind.
i
think
that's
another
case.
this
case
falls
at
the
core
of
the
statute;
we're
talking
about
someone
who
intends
to
commit
the
core
crime
congress
was
talking
about.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
we
haven't
argued
that
it
is
generic
burglary.
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i
mean,
no.
that's
why
you
have
the
otherwise
clause,
to
cover
offenses
just
as
this
court
said
in
taylor,
that
they
weren't--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no.
i
mean,
you've
identified
an
additional
step
that
the
court
has
to
consider
in
deciding
the
question
in
this
case,
but
that
step
doesn't
necessarily
require
you
to
go
to
court
records.
i
mean,
it's
our
position
that
even
including
the
curtilage,
the
area,
enclosed
area
immediately
surrounding
the
dwelling
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
the
charging
documents
are
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
record
right
now
is
solely
comprised
of
the
presentence
report.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
no.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
he
didn't
object
to
the
facts
in
the
presentence
report.
he
also
did
not
object--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
that
would
resolve
justice
souter's
question
about
whether
it
would
involve
the
curtilage
at
all,
which
would
show
that
there
was
an
attempted
physical
entry
into
the
residence.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
we
don't...
yes,
certainly
we
think
that
any
attempted
burglary
of
a
dwelling
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
categorically.
but
if
you
didn't
agree
with
that,
then,
and
you
thought
that
only
a
subset
of
attempted
burglaries
of
dwellings
would
present
serious
potential
risk,
then
clearly
this
offense
here
that
would
certainly
satisfy
any
conception
of
that.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
because
there
was
an
attempted
physical
entry
into
the
residence.
the
person
was
right
on
the
threshold
of
the
dwelling.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
again,
we
don't
think
you
have
to
attribute
any
particular
significance
to
that.
i
mean,
it's
our
position
that
categorically
this
crime
is
covered.
and
again,
the
case
law
shows
that
there's...
that
with
attempted
burglary
cases,
there
is
a
physical
proximity
to
the
dwelling,
but
even
if
there
was--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--that's
correct.
you
can
always
posit,
under
the
categorical
risk,
you
could
always
posit
a
specific
nonthreatening
hypothetical
that
equally
applies
to
burglary
as
it
does
to
attempted
burglary.
and
so
while
you
could
posit
a
hypothetical
where
someone
trying
to
get
onto
the
curtilage
might
seem
like
it
wouldn't
present
any
injuries,
if
you
think
categorically
about
people
who
are
trying
to
surmount,
get
over
fences
and
walls
to
commit
offenses
in
the
dwelling
or
immediately
around
the
dwelling,
they're
presenting
the
same
sort
of
risk,
and
therefore
the
court
can
conclude
that
it
also...
within
the
otherwise
clause,
the
burglary
under
florida
law
is
not
so
different
from
the
kind
of
burglary
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
it
would
just
drop
out
of
the
picture
entirely.
armed
felons
who
have
the
propensity
to
go
into
the
curtilage
of
someone's
home,
to
either
go
in
the
house
or
right
around
the
house,
present
the
very
kind
of
risk
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
under
shepard,
the
defendant
in
shepard
had
objected
to
the
use
of
police
reports.
my
understanding
is
he
also
submitted
an
affidavit
saying
he
didn't
acknowledge
the
truth
of
anything
in
the
police
report.
so
i
think
this
case
is
distinguishable
in
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
facts
in
the
psr
and
there
was
no
objection
specifically
to
using
the
police
report
as
the
source
for
those
facts.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
it
wouldn't,
no.
i
don't
think
it
would.
but...
no.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
argument--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
if
the
completed
offense
is
a
violent
felony,
the
attempt
to
commit
that
offense
is
also
a
violent
felony.
that's
a
fair
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
thank
you.
