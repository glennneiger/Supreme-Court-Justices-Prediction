justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
ways
to
read
the
burglary,
arson
or
extortion
examples:
that
they
are
clear
examples
of
crimes
that
would
involve
harm
to
individuals,
physical
injury
to
another;
or
they
are
put
in
the
statute
to
say,
even
though
they
don't
involve
serious
risk,
these
specific
crimes
will
be
covered,
because
your
statistic
of
3
percent
suggests
that
burglary
itself
probably
would
not
qualify
as
a
crime
that
presents
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury,
but
the
statute
nevertheless
defines
it.
so
do
you
read
those
terms
as
giving
examples
of
crimes
that
would
not
involve
that
risk
of
injury
or
as
examples
of
crimes
that
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
marcus,
isn't
there
this...
this
linguistic
problem
with
the
statute
anyway?
because
this
language
if
it
said...
that
sometimes
presents
a
serious
risk,
then
the
answer
would
be
obvious.
if
otherwise
it
said
that
characteristically
presents
a
serious
risk,
then
it
might
be
closer.
and
which
do
you
think
is
the
more
normal
reading
of
it?
i
think
either
is...
certainly
fits
the
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
means
sometimes
presents
a
potential
risk
of
physical
injury,
then
obviously
they're
all
covered.
or
if
it
says
characteristically
presents
the
risk,
potential
risk,
then
do
you
have
to
decide
whether
that,
it
is
a
characteristic
of
potential
burglary
that
it...
that
it
does
present
this
risk
or
that
just
once
in
a
while
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
were
true,
and
if
as
your
opponent
said,
that
in
actual
burglaries
there's
only
three
percent
of
them
actually
involve
risk
to...
of
physical
injury
to
another,
then
attempted
burglary
must
necessarily
be
somewhat
less
than
three
percent.
i
would
think
that.
would
that
satisfy
the
characteristic
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
two
or
three
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
that's
perfectly
clear.
the
"otherwise"
language
does
suggest
that
you
are
right.
but
if
the
statute
instead
of
saying
"otherwise"
had
said,
"or
involves
other
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
risk.
"
which
i
think
is
a
permissible
reading,
perhaps
not
the
best
reading,
but
if
it
said
that,
then
it
is
not...
you
are
not
taking
as
a
given
the
fact
that
the
others
satisfy
the
violent
requirement
but
rather
that
they
are
eligible,
whether
or
not
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand,
we
don't
need
the
statistics,
i
guess
they're
not
available,
but
in
your
view
if
we
did
have
statistics
and
they
showed
that
in
1/10
of
1
percent
of
the
category
of
crimes
across
the
nation,
there
was
this
risk,
that
would
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
well,
for
attempts
or
complete...
i
mean,
just
say
the
standard
of
what
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury,
if
1/10
of
1
percent
of
the
crimes...
whatever
the
category,
did
present
such
a
risk,
that
would
be
sufficient
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it's
a
really
easy
case,
because
really
there
is
some
risk
in
every
case.
there's
some
risk
that
somebody
will,
you
know,
bump
into
somebody
or
give
them
a
punch
in
the
nose
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
none
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
satisfy
the
risk
of
physical
injury
in
the
burglary
case.
you
can
have
unarmed
burglars.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
as
i
understand
your
view--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
in
1/10
of
1
percent
of
the
cases,
there
is
in
fact
a
physical
confrontation,
that's
enough,
which
makes
it
a
pretty
easy
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about...
do
you
think
the
facts
in
the
presentence
report
are
admitted
by
your
opponent
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
can
we
consider
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
therefore,
then
the
question
is
whether
throwing
the
hammer
through
the
window
is
sufficient;
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
think
that
the
hammer
through
the
window
is
a
decisive
fact
if
we
do
look
at
the
individual
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
hammer
is
thrown
through
the
window,
is
that...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
view
of
the
importance
of
the
hammer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
unclear
as
to
how
much
significance
we
pay
to
that
hammer.
