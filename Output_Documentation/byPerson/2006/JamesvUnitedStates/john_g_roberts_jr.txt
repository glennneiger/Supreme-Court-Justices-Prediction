chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
james
versus
united
states.
mr.
crawford?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
florida,
that
would
be
burglary
itself,
right,
because
it
covers
the
curtilage
around
the
house?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
we
don't
even
have
to
ask
whether
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
under
the
statute,
right?
because,
if
burglary
is
identified
as...
a
predicate
offense
without
the
need
to
resort
to
the
definition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
specifically
deleted
or
didn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
quite
different
than
specifically
deleting
it.
in
other
words,
it
was
never
there
in
the
proposal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
do
i
understand
your
submission
to
be
that
putting
a
ladder
against
the
side
of
a
house
to
attempt
burglary,
starting
up
the
ladder,
that
that
generically
does
not
pose
a
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
understand
from
your
friend
on
the
other
side
that
an
overt
act
toward
fulfilling
the
attempt
is
required
under
florida
law.
in
other
words,
it's
not
just
enough
to
have
burglary
tools
in
your
house.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
got
to
take
an
affirmative
step
toward
accomplishing
the
burglary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that,
is
conspiracy
to
commit
burglary
a
crime
that
poses
a
serious
potential
risk
as
burglary
does?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
that
seem
like
a
fine
line?
i
mean,
if
you're
sitting
around
with
your
coconspirator
planning
it
you
can
be
covered
under
this
provision,
planning
a
burglary.
but
if
you
actually
get
out
there
with
the
burglary
tools,
you
put
the
ladder
against
the
door
and
you
start
up
the
ladder,
that
somehow
involves
less
of
a
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
the
eleventh
circuit
is
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
two
of
the
other
named
crimes,
attempts
would
present
a
serious
potential
risk?
in
other
words,
attempted
arson
or
attempted
use
of
explosives?
you
concede
those
would
be
covered,
don't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
crawford.
mr.
marcus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
believe
it
for
a
minute.
[laughter]
why
do
you
look
at--
the
risk
of
burglary
and
then
view
attempt
as
a
sort
of
lesser
included
offense?
i
mean,
attempts
themselves
have
their
own
independent
risk
of
physical
injury.
obviously,
if
you've
got
a
ladder
up
against
the
side
of
my
house
and
you're
halfway
up
and
i
come
home,
there's
a
risk
of
injury
there,
even
though
there's
no...
regardless
of
whether
the
person
gets
into
the
house
or
not.
and
i
think
perhaps
there's
even
a
greater
risk
of
potential...
greater
potential
risk
of
injury
with
respect
to
attempts
because
they
don't
succeed.
why
don't
they
succeed?
because
something
interrupts
them.
and
what
interrupts
them,
it
may
well
be
the
home
owner.
so
i
don't
know
that
you
have
to
look
to
sort
of
attempt
as
a
lesser
risk
than
the
burglary
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
suppose
the
unsuccessful
burglar
poses
a
greater
risk
of
physical
injury
than
the
successful
burglar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marcus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
crawford,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
different
when
you're
dealing
with
an
escapee
or
someone
who
has
visitation
right
and
then
doesn't
report
back
and
qualifies
as
a
escaped
felon
from
prison.
that's
quite
a
bit
different
from
an
arrest
in
a
normal
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
there's
a
greater...
i
had
this
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
there's
a
greater
degree
of
potential
when
you're
dealing
with
someone
who's
escaped
from
prison
than
with
someone
else
who's
being
arrested.
of
course
there's
always
the
potential,
but
the
judgment
was
that
there's
a
greater
degree
of
potential
when
you're
trying
to
apprehend
someone
who's
escaped.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
crawford.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
05-9264,
james
v.
united
states.
