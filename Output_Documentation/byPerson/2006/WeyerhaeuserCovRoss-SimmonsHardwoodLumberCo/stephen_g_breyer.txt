g.
breyer
but
even
it
does
hurt
the
suppliers
and
the
antitrust
laws
are
just
as,
i
don't
know
just
as,
but
they
are
just
as
concerned
about
a
group
of
small
farmers
or
a
group
of
small
growers
or
a
group
of
small
fishermen
faced
with
a
monopsony
buyer
as
they
are
with
a
group
of
consumers
having
to
fight
off
a
monopoly
seller.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
that's
pretty
well
established,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
congress
has
actually
passed
special
legislation
that
the
mandeville
farms
is
consistent
with
the
farmers
cooperative
and
so...
you
want
me
to
write
the
proposition
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
concerned--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
the
monopoly
buyer
who
would
in
fact
exploit
a
group
of
small
suppliers,
farmers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
can't
possibly
be
right,
can
it?
i
mean
if
in
fact
the
object
here
is
to
strike,
is...
suppose
their
object
is
what
you
say.
their
object
is
in
fact
to
try
to
get
a
monopoly
on
the
buying
side
over
a
group
of
small
woodsmen.
and
they
might
do
that
if
they
drove
out
all
the
buying
competitors,
and
now
what
are
they
going
to
try
to
do?
what
they
will
try
to
do
if
they
get
that
terrible
monopoly,
which
would
be
bad--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
drive
prices
way
down,
below
what
the
woodsmen
could
get
for
them.
and
if
that's
going
to
have
any
effect
aside
from
an
income
effect,
it
will
leave
some
of
them
to
go
to
the
bread
line
or
go
to
other
places
where
they
have
other
jobs
at
lesser
revenue
than
they
would
get
by
staying
in
the
woods
business
and
selling
at
a
reasonable
price.
that
would
be
an
antitrust
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
where
we
are
is
at
the
problem.
the
problem
is
the
same
as
at
the
buying
side.
what
we
have
is
possibly
a
very
bad
motive
and
very
bad
effects.
on
the
other
hand,
low
prices
are
good
for
the
consumer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
we
have
bad
effects,
bad
possibilities.
on
the
other
hand,
higher
prices
are
good
for
the
woodsmen.
so
we
need
rules
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats.
and
the
other
side
is
proposing
a
rule,
and
the
rule
simply
is
don't
count
this
as
bad
conduct,
unless
the
person
who
pays
the
money
for
the
goods
is
in
fact
buying
so
many
goods
that
later
on
when
he
tries
to
sell
them
he
will
incur
a
loss.
now
i
would
have
thought
for
40
years
that
was
a
traditional
idea.
if
you're
trying
to
decide
whether
people
are
hogging
goods
unnecessarily
for
bad
purposes,
or
rather
storing
up
nuts
for
winter
for
good
purposes,
then
a
very
good
key
to
that
is
do
these
people
expect
in
the
long
run
to
make
money
out
of
this
without
driving
those
victims
out?
if
the
answer
is
yes;
they
can
make
money
on
the
market,
they
are
storing
up
nuts
for
winter.
it's
good.
and
if
the
answer
is
no
it's
bad.
that's
called
the
recoupment
test.
i
don't
think
that's
new.
i
think
it's
old.
and
i'm
not
sure
what
your
view
of
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
agree
with
you.
but
i
don't
still
think
you
can
defend
this
retail
versus
maximum
price
restraint.
that's
a
whole
another
kettle
of
fish.
and
what
i'm
interested...
i
guess
my
question
particularly
is,
i
propose
one
test
not
two,
but
it
might
be
that
my
test
encompasses
the
dollar
test
and
incremental
costs
and
so
forth.
what
do
you
think
of
my
one
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
test
is
if
they
are
not
going
to
make
money
legitimately
out
of
this
in
the
long
run,
it's
bad,
unless
they
can
explain
it
away.
but
if
they
are,
it's
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
they
say
they
needed
it?
i
mean,
why
do
you
need
all
this
ph.d.
guy
up
there?
why
don't
you
just
prove
what
you
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
why
do
you
need
all
these
other
instructions
about
pricing?
i
suppose
the
only
reason
you'd
need
them
is
if
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
in
their
economic
interest
in
the
absence
of
any
intent
to
monopolize
these
people
to
buy
all
these
logs
or
not.
and
so
it
would
be
very
interesting
if
you
have
a
way
of
proving
that
they
did
not
need
these
for
any
legitimate
purpose,
a
matter
which
is
likely
to
be
disputed.
so,
i
think
the
hard
thing
in
these
cases
is
to
prove
that.
and
if
you
can
tell
me
how
you
prove
that
without
giving
the
jury
an
instruction
something
like,
look
to
see
whether
they
can
sell
them
reasonably
at
a
profit.
or,
look
to
see
even
if
they
can't
sell
them
at
a
profit,
whether
they
could
recoup
whatever
they
are
losing
later.
or,
or,
and
you
fill
in
some
blanks,
and
now
i'll
have
some
candidates
for
testing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
but
of
course,
i
want
to
injure
competition
always
when
i
in
fact
sell
at
a
lower
price
that
i
very
much
hope
my
competitor
can't
possibly
meet,
indeed
would
go
out
of
business.
i
cheer.
i
would
love
to
get
a
monopoly.
i
would
love
to
make
a
better
product,
lower
prices,
et
cetera.
do
you
see
the
problem?
and
so
what
you've
told
the
jury
there
on
that
instruction--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
they
can
find
this
person
guilty
even
if
all
he
wants
to
do
is
so
second-guess
that
market
that
he
gets
the
logs
and
will
sell
them
at
a
huge
profit
later
on
in
a
competitive
selling
market.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
it
were
the
highest
cost
producer?
suppose
still,
they
think
that
by
buying
these
logs
we
later
can
make
a
profit
when
we
resell
them
on
the
competitive
market.
you
see,
the
reason
they're
coming
up
with
this
test
is
they
don't
think
you
can
give,
the
reasoning
of
it
is
that
they
don't
think
that
you
can
produce
a
better
one.
so
i'm
listening.
