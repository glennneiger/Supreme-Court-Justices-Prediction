justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pincus,
how
do
you
determine
the
price
of
the
logs?
because
we,
the
charges
that
some
logs
were
purchased
at
an
excessive
price,
and
if
we
were
dealing
with
only
those
logs
to
determine
cost,
that's
one
thing.
but
we
are,
also
in
this
picture
is
that
some
of
the
logs
came
from
weyerhaeuser's
own
land
and
some
came
from
long-term
contracts
that
it
had,
and
those,
the
price
was
not
inflated
on
those.
so
if
you
take
those
into
account
you
may
get
one
figure,
but
if
you
take
only
the
high
bid
logs
you
might
get
a
different
picture.
so
how,
what
is
it?
how
do
you
determine
costs?
do
you
look
at
all
the
logs
that
were
purchased
or
only
the
ones
that
were
allegedly
bid
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
proposed
the
instruction
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
requested
charge
on
this
point
by
the
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
why
is
it
easy
to
figure
out?
as
justice
breyer
brought
up
the
stockpiling,
how
do
you
know
whether
they
are
storing
it,
or
a
time
when
the
supply
is
short,
or
they
are
just
letting
it
go
to
rack
and
moon
in
order
to
put
this
company
out
of
business?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
you
couldn't
have
made
it
on
brooke
group
because
they
were
selling
these
logs
at
a
profit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
you
could
not
have
prevailed
under
the
brooke
group
test
because
weyerhaeuser
was,
was
making
a
profit
on
these
sales
even
though
it
had
bid
up
the
price
of
the
logs?
