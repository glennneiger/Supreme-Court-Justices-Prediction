justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
argument
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
briefs
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
how
to
calculate
cost?
you
basically
have
two
markets.
you
don't
usually
think
of
cost
when
you
buy
something.
but
was
there
any
argument
as
to
how
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
below
cost
in
the
brooke
group
sense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
the
end
of
it
at
the
trial
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
we
have
to
get
into
this
but
if
we
do,
i'm
not
sure
about
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
if
you
have
your
own
logs
that
you
own
already
and
if
you
have
logs
on
a
long-term
contract,
the
only
relevant
logs
are
the
logs
that
both
people
are
competing
for.
that's
the
only
relevant
market
that
we
are
talking
about
insofar
as
the
purchaser
is
concerned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
weyerhaeuser
wanted
to
drive
somebody
out
of
the
market,
then
they
go
after
the
logs
which
are
open
to
both
parties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
so
hard
if
you
take
justice
stevens'
premise
that
there's
an
agreement
and
we
take
that
as
a
given,
as
a
given
premise?
