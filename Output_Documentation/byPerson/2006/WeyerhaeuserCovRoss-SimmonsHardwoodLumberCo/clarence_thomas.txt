thomas
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
weyerhaeuser
versus
ross-simmons
hardwood
lumber
company
no.
05-381.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
two
sawmills
that
competed
to
produce
finished
hardwood
lumber
in
the
pacific
northwest.
respondent
ross-simmons
blamed
petitioner
weyerhaeuser
for
driving
it
out
of
business
by
bidding
up
the
price
of
red
alder
saw
logs
which
both
mills
processed
into
finished
lumber.
ross-simmons
filed
an
antitrust
suit
against
weyerhaeuser
alleging
monopolization,
an
attempted
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court
refused
to
issue
a
jury
instruction
that
incorporated
elements
of
the
test
we
set
forth
for
analyzing
predatory-pricing
claims
in
brooke
group
versus
brown
&
williamson.
a
jury
found
weyerhaeuser
liable,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
brooke
group
did
not
provide
the
appropriate
standard
for
predatory-bidding
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
in
a
predatory-bidding
scheme
the
purchaser
bids
up
the
market
price
of
an
input
so
high
that
rival
buyers
cannot
afford
to
purchase
the
input.
once
the
predatory
bidder
has
caused
competing
buyers
to
exit
the
market,
it
then
attempts
to
drive
down
the
prices
of
inputs.
by
lowering
input
prices
the
predatory
bidder
stands
to
make
supracompetitive
profits
that
will
at
least
offset
the
losses
it
incurred
while
bidding
up
input
prices.
the
close
connection
between
predatory-bidding
and
predatory-pricing
suggest
that
similar
legal
standards
should
apply
to
both.
predatory-bidding
mirrors
aspects
of
predatory-pricing
that
we
considered
important
in
brooke
group.
we
concluded
in
brooke
group
that
predatory-pricing
schemes
are
rarely
tired
and
even
more
rarely
successful.
that
conclusion
applies
with
equal
force
to
predatory-bidding
because
rational
businesses
will
rarely
suffer
certain
short-term
losses
on
the
unlikely
chance
that
they
might
later
make
supracompetitive
profits.
predatory-bidding
schemes
are
unlikely
to
occur
frequently.
also,
like
predatory-pricing,
the
actions
that
serve
as
a
basis
for
liability,
bidding
up
prices
for
inputs
are
often
the
very
essence
of
competition.
there
are
a
number
of
procompetitive
reasons
why
an
input
purchaser
might
take
actions
that
raise
the
price
of
inputs.
given
these
and
other
similarities
we
are
convinced
that
the
test
we
applied
to
predatory-pricing
in
brooke
group
should
also
apply
to
predatory-bidding
claims.
a
predatory-bidding
plaintiff
must
therefore
make
two
showings
to
succeed
on
its
claim.
first,
it
must
prove
that
the
defendant’s
high
bidding
caused
the
cost
of
the
relevant
output
to
rise
above
the
revenues
generated
by
the
sale
of
those
outputs.
second,
a
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
defendant
has
a
dangerous
probability
of
recouping
the
losses
incurred
in
bidding
up
input
prices.
ross-simmons
has
conceded
that
it
has
not
satisfied
the
brooke
group
test
therefore
its
predatory-bidding
theory
of
liability
cannot
support
the
jury’s
verdict.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
