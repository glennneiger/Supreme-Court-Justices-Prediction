would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
you
added
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
very
high
barriers
of
entry
that
would
prevent
other
competitors
from
entering
the
market
after
the
target
was
driven
out?
justice

if
we
don't
take
the
brooke
group
approach,
is
the
alternative
to
ask
the
jury
to
do
what
the
instructions
in
this
case
ask
them
to
do.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

to
decide
whether
weyerhaeuser
bought
more
logs
than
it
needed
in
order
to
prevent
its
rivals
from
obtaining
the
logs
that
they
needed
at
a
fair
price?
how
is
a
jury
to,
a
lay
jury,
to
decide
whether
a
company
like
weyerhaeuser
bought
more
logs
than
it
needed,
or
what
is
the
fair
price?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
think
it
was
sufficient.

you
think

was

enough.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

what
does
that
mean?
what
does
a
fair
price
in
this,
in
this
context
mean?
does
it
mean
the
price
that's
necessary
in
order
to
keep
an
inefficient
competitor
in
business?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
about
the
recoupment
prong,
given
that
weyerhaeuser
doesn't
have
market
power
in
the
selling
market
and
that
mills
were
entering,
new
mills
were
coming
on
line
during
this
period.
how
would
you
satisfy
the
recoupment?
