mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standards
this
court
adopted
in
brooke
group
to
determine
whether
a
seller's
prices
violate
the
antitrust
laws
because
they
are
too
low
also
should
apply
in
assessing
the
claim
that
the
buyer's
purchase
prices
are
illegally
high.
we
submit
that
the
brooke
group
test
applies
because
the
four
key
underpinnings
of
the
court's
ruling
apply
fully
here.
first,
there's
a
high
risk
of
mistaking
aggressive
competition
for
anticompetitive
behavior.
increasing
the
prices
that
are
paid
for
inputs
like
lowering
sales
prices
is
a
mechanism
by
which
a
firm
competes.
it's
the
result
that
we
would
expect
from
a
buyer's
ordinary
competitive
instincts.
so
the
conduct
targeted
here
is
on
its
face
identical
to
core
procompetitive
conduct.
it's
also
very
hard
to
distinguish
losses
suffered
by
a
more
inefficient
competitor
from
hard...
to
anticompetitive
behavior,
but
the
antitrust
laws--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
our
position
is
that
that
is
what
the
jury
was
instructed,
because
the
predatory
pricing
instruction
said
one
of
plaintiff's
contentions
is
that
defendant
purchased
more
logs
than
needed
or
paid
a
higher
price
for
logs
than
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
plaintiffs
from
obtaining
the
logs
they
needed
at
a
fair
price.
i'm
reading
from
page
14(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
then
it
concluded,
if
you
find
this
to
be
true,
you
may
regard
it
as
an
anticompetitive
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
there
is
no,
there
is
no
contention
here
about
monopoly
power.
the
focus
here
is
on
the
conduct
element
of
section
2.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
are
not
disputing
it
before
this
court.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
our
view
is
what
the
court
has
said
in
cases
like
trinko,
is
that
the
test
is
monopoly
power
and
anticompetitive
conduct.
those
are
the
two
elements.
we
are
not
contesting
the
monopoly
power
element.
we
are
looking
at
whether
there
was
anticompetitive
conduct
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
because
this
is
a
claim
under
section
2,
there
would
have
to
be
either
monopoly
power
or
a
danger
of
probability
to
the
monopoly
power.
it's
single
firm
conduct
so
there
would
have
to
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing
both
things.
i
think,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
much
space
between
the
two,
but
to
the
extent
there
is,
we
are
arguing
both.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
guess
the
way
i
think
the
court
has
approached
determining
anticompetitive
act,
anticompetitive
conduct,
is
it's
the
kind
of
conduct
when
engaged
in
by
a
monopolist
or
an
entity
that
has
a
dangerous
probability
of
cheating
it,
it
is
a
violation
of
this
statute.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
because
brooke
involved
a
claim
under
the
patent
act.
but
this
court
in
the
trinko
case
has
certainly
interpreted
the
brooke
standard
as
also
applying
to
claims
under
section
2.
and
in
fact
the
court
explicitly
said
that
in
brooke
group.
as
i
said,
the
first
critical
underpinning
is
the
risk
of
mistaking
aggressive
competition
for
anticompetitive
behavior.
second,
this
case
involves--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
we
don't,
we
don't
think
that
that
difference
is
a
distinction
that
warrants
a
different
test,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
here
with
single
firm
pricing
conduct
and
it's
recognized
that
that's
key
to
the
proper
functioning
of
the
markets.
as
the
court
said
in
professional
engineers,
fixed
pricing
is
the
central
nervous
system
of
the
economy.
it
allocates
goods
and
ensures
that,
that
they
are
allocated
to
the
most
efficient
use.
here,
although
there's
no
immediate
benefit
to
consumers,
there
is
an
immediate
benefit
to
the
sellers
of
the
logs,
who
certainly
benefit
when
competition
drives
up
the
prices
that
they
achieve.
and
we
think
that
the
sherman
act
protects
them
and
gives
them
the
benefit
of
full
competition
just
as
much
as
it
does
consumers.
over
the
course--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
in
mandeville
farms,
which
was
a
section
1
case,
the
court
did
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
antitrust
laws
protect
sellers
as
well
as
buyers,
and
that
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
allegedly
a
section
1
conspiracy
to
price
too
low,
and
the
court
said
that's
per
se
unlawful.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
the
benefit
that
i
think
the
court
is
looking
at
in
both
cases
is
not
the
particular
price
levels,
but
in
achieving
and
ensuring
free
price
competition
because
of
the
central
role
that
price
plays
in
the
economy.
that's
what
the
court
is
trying
to
protect
in
professional
real
estate...
in
professional
engineers--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
is
our
second
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
the
claim
is
that
the
supply
was
relatively
inelastic,
not
that
it's
perfectly
inelastic,
and
as
long
as
the
supply
market
is
not
perfectly
inelastic,
an
increase
in
price
may
lead
to
more
supplies,
maybe
not
as
much
as
if
there
were
higher
elasticity,
but
more.
but
there's
another
benefit
to
consumers
here,
which
is
that
if
one
would
expect
that
a
buyer
bidding
more
can
make
a
more
efficient
use
of
the
product
and
therefore
generate
more
output,
and
that
output
expansion
which
doesn't
depend
on
supply
expansion
is
also
beneficial
to
consumers
because
that
means
there
will
be
more
output
in
the
downstream
market
and
a
corresponding
decrease
in
price.
so
we
have
those
two
benefits
to
consumers
and
we
also
have
the
fact
that
as
the
court
said
in
professional
engineers,
the
sherman
act
reflects
a
judgment
that
price
competition
generally,
a
free
and
open
price
competition
will
produce
lower
prices
and
better
goods
and
services,
and
the
court
has
not
required
that
that
be
traced
to
consumer
welfare
in
every
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
what
the
record
reflects
here,
that
weyerhaeuser
invested
in
its
lumber
mills
and
created
a
process
that
got
more
value
out
of
a
log.
the
record
reflects
that
plaintiffs,
for
example,
did
not
do
that.
and
there
is
testimony
that
plaintiff's
mill
was
quite,
relatively
inefficient
compared
to
weyerhaeuser.
weyerhaeuser
invested
new
processes
that
had
less
waste,
produced
more
output
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
and
therefore
it
was
able
to
sell,
sell
that
output
at
a
lower
price
and
still
make
a
profit,
because
it
was
getting
more
output
for
log
and
therefore
could
pay
more
for
the
log.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
our
view,
justice
kennedy,
there
really
wasn't,
because
the
district
judge
had
made
clear
his
view
in
the
pretrial
motions
that
there
wasn't
a
need
to
prove
prices,
and
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
our
position
is,
and
there
has
certainly
been
some
writing
on
this
in
the
literature,
is
that
what
one
does
is
take
the
cost
of
producing
the
output
which
includes
the
allegedly
predatory
price
of
the
log,
and
here
logs
are
75
percent
of
the
cost
so
it's
a
very
big
cost.
compare
those
costs
to
the
revenues
that
are
received
in
the
downstream
market
and
if
those
revenues
exceed
costs,
then
you're
in
a
position
where
the
defendant
is
behaving
perfectly
economically
rationally.
if
they're
less,
then
you
go
on
to
recoup
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
you
would
look,
you
would
look,
your
honor,
at
all
of
the,
at
all
of
the
logs,
just
as
in
the
downstream
market
if
you
have
a
sell
side
case,
you
look
at,
you
look
at
prices
of
all
sales.
here
it's
interesting
that
the
record
reflects
that
plaintiff
received
more
than,
between
30
and
50
percent
of
its
logs
from
the
same
kind
of
long-term
sources
that
it
argues
that
weyerhaeuser
received
it
from.
so
in
this
case
there
really
isn't
the
kind
of
disparity,
but
our
position
would
be
that
you
add
all
of
those
up
and
compare
them
to
revenues.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
it
might
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--and
your
honor,
as
the
court
observed
in
brooke
group,
there
really
wasn't
a
need
there
to
get
into
how
the
test
works
and
we
think
there
isn't
here.
we
think
the
issue
is
symmetrical
and
it
might
be
that
the
focus
is
on
the
incremental
costs
that
are
associated
with
the
alleged
predatory
volume,
and
therefore
that
might
focus
on
those
incremental
costs.
but
in
this
case
there's
no
dispute
that,
whatever
the
measure
of
costs,
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
the
position
that
weyerhaeuser's
prices
were
above
those
costs.
let
me
just
turn
back
to,
to
the
other
two
reasons
why
we
think
brooke
group
applies
because
i
think
they're
important.
the
third
is
it's
much
more
likely
that
the
high
bids
here
were
going
to,
were
a
result
of
legitimate
competition
than
of
anticompetitive
effort.
as
this
court
has
observed
both
in
brooke
group
and
matsushita,
predatory
conduct
is
self-deterring.
to
engage
in
it,
the
defendant
has
to
be
willing
to
incur
a
near-term
loss
against
the
hope
of
higher
returns
later.
and
as
the
court
explained
in
those
cases,
the
loss
is
definite
but
the
gain
depends
on
a
number
of
imponderables.
so
there
is
some
self-deterring.
and
finally,
a
test
that
provides
no
guidance
threatens
false
positives
that
will
deter
the
very
competition
that
our
economy
requires
and
that
helps
our
economy
reach
its
most
efficient
state.
as
justice
breyer
put
it
for
the
first
circuit
in
town
of
concord,
antitrust
rules
must
be
clear
enough
for
lawyers
to
explain
them
to
their
clients,
especially
in
a
sensitive
area
like
pricing.
and
certainly
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
here
has
none
of
that
clarity
and
we
think
that
the
court's
brooke
group
decision
and
that
test
does.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
the
only
anticompetitive
conduct
alleged
was
pricing
conduct,
your
honor?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
even
if
that
was
the
whole
purpose.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
stevens,
is
it's
very
hard
to
distinguish,
especially
for
the
judicial
system
to
distinguish,
between
hard-fought
competition
and
anticompetitive
intent
if
all
we're
looking
at
is
what's
in
people's
mind
set.
as
judge
easterbrook
wrote
in
his
aa
poultry
decision--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
because
there
won't
be
a
given
premise
in
every
case,
your
honor,
and
the
problem
is
the
court
has
to
write
rules
that
will,
that
will
govern
conduct,
primary
conduct
of
business
people
in
the
market,
and
a
rule
that
says
if
you
can
prove
intent
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
prices
and
costs
is
a
rule
that
opens
the
door
to
second-guess,
judicial
second-guessing
of
prices--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
section
2
context,
the
problem
of
deterring
procompetitive
conduct
is
even
more
serious
because
you
don't
have
the
threshold
requirement
of
proof
of
conspiracy,
as
one
does
in
section
1.
we're
dealing
with
unilateral
conduct,
and
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
market
definition
is
a
complicated
issue
and
it
may
be
hard
for
businesses--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
would
not
establish
a
violation,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
brooke
group
court
dealt
with
that
very
case
because
the
dissent
in
brooke
group
pointed
out
that
the
district
court
in
that
case
had
held
that
the
intent
evidence
was
amongst
the
most
powerful
that
had
ever
been,
been
presented
in
any
case,
and
it
still
said,
even
though
there
was
a
clear
evidence
of
intent--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
it
involved
the
test
for
predatory
pricing,
your
honor,
under
robinson-patman.
but
the
court
said
its
test
was
perfectly
applicable
to
section
2.
and
the
lower
courts
have
certainly
applied
that
test
in
just
that
way
in
section
2
cases.
and
if
the
rule
would
be
that
even
in
the
predatory
selling
situation
intent
can
override
the
price-cost
and
the
recoupment
requirements,
then
you're
in
a
situation
where
there's
no
ability
for
business
people
to
know
in
advance
when
low
prices
are
justified.
all
we
think
is
that
there
should
be
symmetry.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
points.
with
respect
to
the
story
of
how
this
instruction
came
to
be,
in
fact
it
closely
resembles
some
language
that
was
requested
by
respondent
that
appears
on
page
93a
of
the
joint
appendix
which
refers
to
a
test
that
paying
a
price
for
logs
with
higher
than
market
value
unnecessarily
to
drive
out
or
injure
competition.
so
i
do
think
that
this
is
an
instruction
that
comes
from
respondent.
it's
true
that
we
did
not
request
a
brooke
group
instruction
because
the
district
court
had
ruled
that
brooke
group
didn't
apply
at
the
summary
judgment
phase.
we
did
object
to
the
instruction
proposed
by
the
district
judge
on
the
grounds
that
it
did
not
conform
with
brooke
group
in
order
to
preserve
our
argument
here
and
we
believe
that
that
objection
gives
the
court
the
power
to
adopt
an
intermediate
rule,
but
it
isn't
exactly
what
we
requested
and
there
are
decisions
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
to
that
effect.
with
respect
to
the
question
about
purchasing
more
logs
than
they
needed,
as
we
say
in
our
briefs
we
think
that
that
claim
can't
really
be
separated
from
the
predatory
pricing
claim
here
because
the
argument
is
that
by
purchasing
more
logs
the
price
was
driven
up
and
it's
the
increased
price,
that's
the
impact
that
respondent
complains
of.
so
creating
a
separate
overbuying
claim
that
relies
on
price
for
impact
would
be
the
same
thing
as
saying
on
the
sell
side
you
can
have
an
overselling
claim
regardless
of
whether
you
flunk
the
brooke
group
standard
with
respect
to
prices,
and
that's
just
going
to
undercut
the
certainty
that
this
court
has
prescribed.
with
respect
to
the
document
that
mr.
haglund
cited,
901a
about
the
inputs,
that
document
is
described
in
testimony
in
the
joint
appendix
at
571a
to
573a,
and
that's
a
hypothetical
look
at
what
the
market
might
would
look
like
if
current,
past
purchasing
patterns
had
continued.
it's
not
a
document
that
in
any
way
says
that
the
various
sources
of
log
supply
were
locked
up
and
it
doesn't
indicate
that,
and
in
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
percentage
of
logs
were
that
were
available
to
weyerhaeuser
by
long-term
contract,
in
contrast,
as
i
said,
to
the
testimony
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
respondent
got
between
30
and
50
percent
of
its
logs
through
those
long-term
sources.
with
respect
to
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case,
in
the
boyle
case
this
court
made
clear
that
where
there's
no,
not
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record...
i'm
sorry,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
andrew
j.
