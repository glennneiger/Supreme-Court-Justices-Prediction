justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
before
you
get
too
far
into
your
argument?
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
instructions
to
the
jury
were
that
finding
that
predatory
price
cutting
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
establish
a
section
2
violation?
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
reads
that
way
but
is
it,
do
you
think
the
jury
was
so
instructed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
consider
it
as
an
anticompetitive
act,
but
it
does
not
say
you
may
regard
it
as
a
violation
of
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
read
the
instructions,
it
did
require
there
be
three
elements
of
the
violation
of
section
2
which,
two
of
which
were
not
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
there
is
monopoly
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
relevant
to
the
question
whether,
if
there
is
monopoly
power
plus
an
attempt
to
preserve
that
power
or
require
that
power,
plus
an
anticompetitive
act,
is
that
a
violation
of
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
the
conduct
in
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
a
violation,
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
plus
the
monopoly
power--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
so
you're
arguing
not
only
that
the
pricing
conduct
was
not
itself
sufficient
to
prove
a
violation,
but
it
also
was
not
even
an
anticompetitive
act
that
may
give
rise
to
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
obviously,
if
there's
just
an
anticompetitive
act
without
a
violation
of
the
statute,
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
in
the
brooke
case,
it
may
not
have
even
been
a
monopolist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
the
evidence
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
company
did
engage
in
a
plan
to
get
a
total
monopoly
and
there
were
minutes
of
the
board
of
directors
says
that
in
order
to
do
this
we've
got
to
drive
company
x
out
of
business
and
so
you,
we
want
you
to
compete
in
every
transaction
with
company
x
that
you
can
and
buy
the
logs
at
a
higher
price.
would
that
be
an
anticompetitive
act
even
if
it
did
not
result
in
loss
to
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
the
anticompetitive...
the
plan
is
to
drive
the
company
out
of
business.
and
the
only
anticompetitive
conduct
other
than
proving
the
whole
objective
is
that
you
pick
on
this
one
competitor
and
outbid
him
every
time
you
can.
could
that
possibly
give
rise
to
a
damage
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
whole
purpose
was
to
drive
it
out
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pursuant
to
a
plan
to
acquire
a
monopoly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
only
intent
plus
monopoly
power.
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
monopoly
power,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
aren't
too
many
cases
that
fit
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
unilateral
conduct
where
you
have
monopoly
power.
there
aren't
too
many
of
these
cases,
as
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
an
issue
that
was
resolved
by
the
jury
in
this
case
and
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
disputing
the
resolution
of
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
did
not
involve
a
monopoly.
that
did
not
involve
monopoly
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you
have
to
have
the
monopoly
power
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
if
as
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case
there
was
proof
of
monopoly
power
and
intent
to
maintain
or
preserve
that
power,
plus
anticompetitive
acts,
does
the
anticompetitive
act
have
to
be
in
and
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
do
have
all
three,
is
that
enough
to
prove
a
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
how
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
it
was
not
instructed
it
would
be
sufficient
to
find
a
violation
of
section
2
by
those,
by
that
accounting,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
back
to
my
hypothetical.
supposing
you
have
the
first
two
elements
and
you
say
in
order
to
drive
this
company
out
of
business
we
want
you
to
compete
with
them
and
get
the
logs
at
whatever
cost
it
takes.
would
that
be
an
anticompetitive
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
of
driving
the
company
out
of
business
in
order
to
accomplish
the
goal
of
getting
a
monopoly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
this
is
not
evidence
of
intent.
there's
independent
evidence
of
both
intent
and
monopoly
power.
with
those
two
elements
established,
would
this,
the
kind
of
evidence
i
described,
be
evidence
of
an
injury
to
the
plaintiff
that
could
be
actual
in
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you
need
to
meet
the
prongs
of
the
brooker
test
even
if
you
otherwise
prove
a
violation
of
section
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
prove
monopoly
power
plus
an
intent
to
maintain
or
acquire
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
insufficient
to
prove
a
violation
of
section
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
monopoly
power
and
it
isn't
even
remotely
at
issue
in
that
case.
