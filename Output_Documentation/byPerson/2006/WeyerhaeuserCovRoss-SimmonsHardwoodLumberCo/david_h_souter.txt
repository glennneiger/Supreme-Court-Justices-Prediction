justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
have
that
in
this
case,
do
you,
because
i
thought
the,
i
thought
one
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
was
the
inelasticity
of
the
supplies,
so
that
no
matter
what
they
were
paying,
basically
the
same
amount
of
wood
was
ultimately
going
to
get
processed;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
also,
i
take
it,
have
to
have
an
equally
limited
approach
on
the
recoupment
analysis,
then.
i
mean,
your
recoupment
analysis
would
have
to
be
symmetrical
with
your
cost
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
the
standard
of
fairness?
i
mean
that,
you
know,
that
may
be
fine.
but
how
does,
how
does
a
jury,
a,
what's
the
authority
for
saying
that
is
the
standard
of
fairness
and
b,
how
does
a
jury
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
you
didn't,
but
that
basically
left
the
jury
on
a,
on
a
free
float,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
assume
i
accept
your
sort
of
delmonte's
analysis
here.
if
we
were
to
approve
of
that
instruction
in
effect,
as
you
want
us
to
do,
and
we
also
believe
that
on
its
face
something
more
has
got
to
be
said
than
merely
the
word
fair,
what
proposition
would
we
say
must
be
included
in
that
instruction
to
make
the
so-called
fairness
instruction
a
sensible
one
that
can
be
consistently
applied?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
saying
if
we
follow
your
lead,
we're
going
to
try
to
take
that
and
make
it
a
closer
to
perfect
instruction,
and
what
should
we
say
must
be
added
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
something
that
we've
got
to
consider
because
if,
if
we
disagree
with
them
on
brooke
group,
we've
got
to
do
it
in
the
course
of
making
a
choice
between
a
brooke
group
instruction
and
something
else,
and
the
only
something
else
we've
got
right
now
is
what
we
have
in
this
case
and
we
ought
to,
we
ought
to
decide
whether
in
fact
that
is
good
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
i
mean,
i
think,
they
may
not
have
made
that
an
independent
basis
of
reversal
but
we've
got
to
consider
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll
stipulate
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
assuming
they
don't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
complaint,
we
have
still
got
to
face
what
the
alternative
to
a
brooke
group
kind
of
instruction
is.
and...
and
however
they
may
have
tried
their
case,
we've
still
got
the
same
problem.
