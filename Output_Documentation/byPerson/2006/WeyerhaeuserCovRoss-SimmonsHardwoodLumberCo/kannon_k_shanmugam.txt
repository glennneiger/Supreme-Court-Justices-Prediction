mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
aggressive
bidding
by
the
buyer
of
an
input,
no
less
than
aggressive
pricecutting
by
the
seller
of
a
finished
product,
is
usually
procompetitive.
because
a
claim
of
predatory
bidding
is
simply
the
flip
side
of
a
claim
of
predatory
pricing,
the
brooke
group
standard
for
predatory
pricing
claims
should
apply
to
predatory
bidding
claims
as
well.
and
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
this
case
by
sanctioning
a
broader
and
more
subjective
standard
of
liability.
in
brooke
group,
this
court
adopted
its
now
familiar
two-pronged
standard
for
predatory
pricing
claims
despite
recognizing
that
each
prong
of
that
standard
might
permit
some
anticompetitive
pricecutting.
the
court
was
willing
to
tolerate
that
modest
degree
of
underinclusion
because,
in
the
court's
own
words,
"the
mechanism
by
which
a
firm
engages
in
predatory
pricing
is
the
same
mechanism
by
which
a
firm
stimulates
competition,
namely
by
lowering
its
prices.
"
"and
the
court
explained
that
a
broader
or
a
less
precise
standard
of
liability
would
run
the
risk
of
prohibiting
or
chilling
some
procompetitive
price
cutting.
"
"in
our
view
the
same
analysis
can
apply
to
a
claim
of
predatory
bidding.
"
"because
aggressive
bidding
is
usually
procompetitive,
application
of
the
brooke
group
standard
is
warranted
in
order
to
avoid
prohibiting
or
chilling
procompetitive
conduct
with
regard
to
price
in
that
context
as
well.
"
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
brooke
group
was
inapplicable
to
respondent's
claim
of
predatory
bidding
by--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understood
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
and
he
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
to
posit
a
case
in
which
there
was
dynamite
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
a
monopolistic
or
exclusionary
intent.
but
in
our
view
that
is
insufficient
to
state
a
section
2
claim.
one
has
to
have
exclusionary
conduct
as
well.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
that
is
also
true,
and
with
regard
to
a
claim
of
attempted--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
you
need
to
have
all
three
of
those
elements
in
order
to
state
a
claim
of
attempted
monopolization--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
would
be
enough
to
state
a
claim
for
attempted
monopolization
under
this
court's
decision
in
separate
forks.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
in
our
view
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
an
anticompetitive
act
to
find
that
petitioner
priced
its
logs--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
the
jury
was
also
instructed
and
in
our
view
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
with
regard
to
the
other
two
elements,
namely
a
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization
and
a
specific
intent
to
monopolize.
the
sole
question
before
this
court
is
what
constitutes
exclusionary
conduct
for
purposes
of
section
2,
what
constitutes
it
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
claim
of
attempted
monopolization
or
actual
monopolization.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
no,
justice
stevens.
that
would
solely
be--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
would
be
evidence,
and
it
may
be
powerful
evidence,
of
a
monopolistic
intent,
though
courts
have
noted
that
even
with
regard
to
that
requirement
it's
famously
difficult
to
distinguish
between
a
legitimate
competitive
attempt
on
the
one
hand
and
an
illegitimate
monopolistic
intent.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
no,
justice
stevens.
you
would
need
to
have
objective
evidence
that
the
defendant
met
both
of
the
prongs
of
the
brooke
group
requirement.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
it
means
to
say
that
you
otherwise
prove
a
violation
in
that
example.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that
is
insufficient.
you
have
to
have
some
action--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it
is
insufficient
to
prove
a
violation
of
section
2
because
you
have
to
have
some
conduct
that
is
classed
as
exclusionary,
and
in
our
view
that
is
the
content
that
the
brooke
group
standard
supplies.
it
specifies
the
conduct
that
you
need
to
have
and
that
conduct
is
the
defendant
suffering
a
loss
in
the
short
term
and
having
a
dangerous
probability
of
recouping
that
loss
in
the
long
term.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
scalia--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--you
could
have
an
incompetent
monopolist
more
generally
or
an
incompetent
predator
in
this
specific
context.
and
i
think
that
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say
with
regard
to
this
colloquy
is
that
the
court
really
did
confront
this
issue
in
brooke
group.
there
was
fairly
strong
evidence
of
monopolistic
intent
and
the
majority
opinion--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
right,
and
it
wasn't
an
issue
simply
because
it
was
a
robinson-patman
act
case
and
all
that
is
required
under
the
robinson-patman
act
is
the
possibility
of
harm
to
competition
and
there
was
some
disagreement
about
whether
a
showing
had
been
made
of
that
requisite
possibility
between
the
majority
opinion
and
your
dissenting
opinion.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
disagreement
in
brooke
group
with
regard
to
the
relevant
standard
for
exclusionary
conduct.
even
the
dissenting
opinion
recognized
that
recoupment
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
state
the
predatory
pricing
claim
in
the
robinson-patman
act
context.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
high
barriers
to
entry,
justice
alito,
would
be
very
relevant
to
the
inquiry
under
the
second
prong
of
the
brooke
group
standard,
namely
whether
the
defendant
had
a
dangerous
probability
of
recoupment
in
the
long
term.
and
indeed
in
many
predation
cases,
many
predatory
pricing
cases
in
the
13
years
since
brooke
group,
barriers
to
entry
have
been
absolutely
vital
in
resolving
predatory
pricing
claims
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
because
typically
defendants
will
make
the
argument
that
the
absence
of
barriers
to
entry
make
the
possibility
of
recoupment
unlikely.
but
that
is
a
consideration
that
is
built
into
the
brooke
group
standard
and
it
certainly
would
be
part
of
the
brooke
group
analysis
in
the
predatory
bidding
context
as
well.
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
kennedy's
questions
to
my
friend
mr.
pincus
about
the
question
of
the
appropriate
measure
of
cost
if
brooke
group
were
to
apply
to
predatory
bidding
claims.
as
in
brooke
group
itself,
we
believe
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
specify
the
exact
method
of
calculating
costs
in
this
case.
but
the
position
of
the
united
states
more
generally
both
in
the
predatory
pricing
context
and
in
the
predatory
bidding
context
is
that
a
court
should
look
to
a
defendant's
incremental
costs,
and
in
this
context
that
would
mean
looking
to
the
amount
of
the
input
that
was
the
subject
of
the
alleged
predation.
so
in
this
case
the
amount
of
logs
that
petitioner
allegedly
predatorily
purchased
on
the
open
market.
and
such
an
incremental
approach
to
be
sure
is
not
within
its
difficulties
in
application
and
for
that
reason
a
number
of
lower
courts
in
the
predatory
pricing
context
have
instead
looked
to
average
variable
costs
or
other
measures
as
a
proxy
for
incremental
costs.
but
we
believe
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
looking
to
incremental
costs
may
be
useful
because
it
effectively
excludes
from
the
analysis
any
potential
cross-subsidization,
whether
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
for
example,
petitioner
may
have
harvested
logs
from
its
own
lands.
there
are
claims
in
this
case
that
petitioner
entered
into
various
exclusive
dealing
arrangements
as
well,
obtained
logs
at
a
lower
price
on
that
basis.
and
an
incremental
approach
has
the
virtue
of
focusing
only
on
that
portion
of
the
market
that
is
the
subject
of
the
alleged
predation
claims.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
that's
absolutely
true,
justice
souter,
and
again
this
is
an
issue
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
grappling
with
in
the
predatory
pricing
context,
and
i
by
no
means
want
to
suggest
that
it
is
always
an
easy
analysis
in
the
predatory
pricing
context.
professor
arita's
treatise
has
hundreds
of
pages
on
the
appropriate
calculation
of
cost,
but
i
think
that
the
important
thing
to
remember
with
regard
to
the
below
cost
pricing
prong
of
the
brooke
group
analysis
is
that
it
does
provide
an
objective
yardstick
by
which
a
defendant's
loss
can
be
measured.
thank
you.
