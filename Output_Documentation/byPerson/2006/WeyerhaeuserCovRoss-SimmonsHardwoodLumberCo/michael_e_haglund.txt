mr.
michael
e.
haglund
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
court's
antitrust
jurisprudence
over
the
last
25
years,
market
realities
have
consistently
trumped
per
se
rules.
the
same
approach
should
apply
here.
brooke
group's
per
se
rule
which
carved
out
a
special
exception
to
the
standard
rule
of
reason
balancing
test
in
section
2
cases
should
not
be
extended
to
the
buy
side.
no
safe
harbor
per
se
rule
is
justified
here
because
raising
input
prices,
unlike
cutting
output
prices,
is
moving
prices
in
the
wrong
direction
for
consumers.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--well
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
mandeville
farms
case
that
mr.
pincus
cited
does
not
stand
for
the
same--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--oh,
absolutely--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
but
in
this
particular
context
which
the
ninth
circuit
repeatedly
emphasized,
in
an
inelastic
market
like
this
one
raising
input
prices
is
not
going
to
increase
supply
and--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--drive
prices
down.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
absolutely,
and
that
is
exactly
what
weyerhaeuser's
plan
was
here,
as
shown
by
their
own
materials,
that
their
plan
was
and
in
fact
they
did
foresee
and
project
that
log
prices
would
go
down
in
2001--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--but
you're
not--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--well,
as
to
brooke
group
and
what
the
court's
being
asked
to
do
here,
justice
breyer,
is
to
go
down
the
same
path
that
it
did
in
albrecht
versus
harold
company
in
'68
when
it
agreed
to
treat
completely
symmetrically
minimum
and
maximum
vertical
resale
price
restraints.
later
on,
in
state
oil
company
vs.
kahn
the
court
abandoned
and
accepted
justice
harlan's
dissent
that
it
was
wrong
to
equate
those
two.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--the
problem
with
granting
a
safe
harbor
for
above
cost
input
purchases
is
that
it
does
not
work
well
in
this
context,
especially
in
an
inelastic
market.
the
suggestion
that
you
can
simply
use
incremental
cost
is
not
a
workable
approach
here
if
you
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well
not,
that's
not
quite
correct,
because
the
signals
that
the
higher
input
prices
show,
yes,
they
do
generally
incent
more
production
in
a,
in
a
typical
market.
here,
however,
where
you
have
a
product
that
takes
30
to
50
years
time
and
production,
the
price,
higher
price
signals
when
they
are
sent
by
a
monopsonist,
like
weyerhaeuser
in
this
case,
actually
send
a
very
powerful
message
to
tree
farmers
not
to
replant
alder,
despite
those
high
prices.
and
there
was
evidence
in
the
follow-on
cases
that
reference
that.
it
was
alleged
in
our
complaint
in
this
case
but
not
actually
backed
up
by
any
testimony
at
trial,
that
tree
farmers
in
oregon
and
washington
were
actually
electing
not
to
replant
alder
and
as
professor
noel
notes
in
his
law
review
article
in
the
issue
of
the
antitrust
law
journal,
which
by
the
way
is
the
only
area...
half
of
this
issue
is
devoted
to
this
subject.
it's
the
sum
total
of
literature
devoted
to
predatory
overbidding
in
this
area.
and
what
professor
noel
notes
is
that
where
you
have
localized
monopsony,
the
result
is
when
the
monopsony
is
in
full
flower
a
misallocation
of
resources
between
regions.
the
highly
productive
forest
lands
of
the
pacific
northwest
won't
have
as
much
alder
in
the
future
because
of
the
significant
signals
sent
by
a
monopsonist,
even
when
they
are
engaged
in
that
scheme.
the
seller
is
happy
if
he
has
mature
alder
to
sell
at
that
time
to
get
the
good
price,
but
he
is
not
going
to
replant,
because
he
sees
that
30
years
down
the
road
he
will
not
have
a
competitive
marketplace
within
which
to
sell
his
timber,
and
that
was
the
reality
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well
we
did
actually
have
some
record
evidence
in
this
case
that
at
least
a
few
people
were
doing
that.
one
of
the
major
suppliers
of
the
respondent
here,
ross-simmons,
was
a
company
called
longview
fiber
which
made
it...
a
very
sophisticated
publicly
held
company...
made
it
a
practice
to
sell
most
of
its
volume
to
ross-simmons
on
a
market
basis
because
it
did
not
want
the
eventuality
of
not
having
ross-simmons
in
that
competitive
circle
with
weyerhaeuser.
most
small
woodland
owners,
however,
who
may
only
be
in
the
market
once
every
five
years
because
that's
the
nature
of
their
rotation,
of
the
age
classes
of
the
timber
that
they
have
got,
are
not
in
that
kind
of
sophisticated
position
because
they
are
in
the
market
so
infrequently
to
make
that
kind
of
a
judgment.
it's
been--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
we
don't
contend
that
the
instruction
was
perfect
here,
but
if
one
looks
at
the
instruction
as
a
whole
and--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
in
this
case
it
was
legally
sufficient
and
i
point
out
that
this
court
very
recently
has
issued
a
decision
in
the
first
case
of
the
term,
ayers
vs.
belmontes,
where
you
looked
at
the
question
of
the
catch-all
mitigation
factor
in
california
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
murder
case.
and
you
looked
at
the
instruction
and
interpreted
it
in
terms
of
the
closing
arguments,
the
evidence
and
the
other
instructions
as
a
whole.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
the
instruction,
the
paragraph
that
is
subject
to
the
great
criticism
on
the
other
side,
was
a
paragraph
that
was
drafted
by
the
district
judge
and
handed
out
near
the
end
of
the
trial
and
then
commented
on
by
the
lawyers
in,
prior
to--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--that's...
as
to
the
issue
of
predatory
pricing,
plaintiffs,
as
we
make
clear
in
our
brief,
actually
submitted
a
predatory
pricing
instruction
three
weeks
before
the
trial.
you
tend
to
be
overinclusive
pretrial.
defendant
on
the
other
hand
surprisingly
submitted
no
such
instruction
on
predatory
pricing.
the
judge
submitted
a
paragraph
that
had
something
more
than
what
the
current,
or
the
ultimate
paragraph
contained.
there
was
a
debate
over
whether
it
needed
to
be,
whether
it
was
consistent
with
brooke
group.
i
agreed
with
the
other
side
that
it
did
not
have
both
components
of
the
brooke
group
test.
judge
panner
and
i
had
a
colloquy
where
ultimately
he
was
going
to
turn
one
paragraph
into
two,
include
a
brooke
group
test.
we
then
withdrew
our
request
for
that
instruction,
weyerhaeuser
objected
to
the,
the
thinned
down
version
of
the
ultimate
paragraph.
but
the
interesting
thing
about
weyerhaeuser's
relationship
to
this
instruction
is
that
they
really
invited
the
linguistic
framework
of
this,
"bought
more
than
they
needed"
or--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--well,
what
it
meant
in
this
case,
justice
alito,
is
that
it
meant
what,
how
much
did
weyerhaeuser
artificially
increase
the
log
market
above
where
it
otherwise
would
have
been?
we
had
several
experts
and
a
number
of
both
industry
and
forest
economists
testify
that
for
20-plus
years
log
prices
had
been
following
lumber.
there
was
an
equilibrium
in
the
market.
then
you
get
to--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--the...
if
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
made
it
clear
that
the
instructions
as
a
whole
provided
sufficient
guidance.
nowhere
in
the
case
as
we
tried
it
did
we
attempt
to
exploit
the
instruction
in
the
way
that
weyerhaeuser
suggests
happened.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well,
i
don't
think
so
if
you
look
at
the
evidence.
the
evidence
that
we
presented
included
a
forest
economist
who
presented
three
different
scenarios
where
he
identified
how
much
weyerhaeuser
had
artificially
increased
log
prices
above
where
they
would
have
been
but
for
their
anticompetitive
behavior.
we
in
no
way
went
to
the
jury
in
closing,
saying
award
what
you
think
is
fair.
we
relied
completely
on
that
evidence,
and
in
fact
the
jury,
which
included
a
ph.d.
in
physics
in
a
high-tech
industry,
an
accountant,
the
head
of
a
chain
store,
and
a
banker
and
a
retired
farmer,
they
looked
at
the
evidence
and
they
actually
to
the
dollar
picked
one
of
those
market-based
scenarios
for
how
much
was
the
market
elevated.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
and
we
don't
contend
that
it
was
a
perfect
instruction.
we
think
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
if--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--okay.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
it's
quite
simple.
if
you
look
at
that
paragraph,
there
are
two
pieces
of
it.
one
of
them,
one
portion
says
that
you
can
regard
it
as
an
anticompetitive
act
if
defendant
purchased
more
logs
than
it
needed.
we
don't
think
that
needs
to
be
improved
because
that's
easy
to
figure
out,
and
here
we
had
evidence
that
they
continued--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--justice
ginsburg,
you
will
know
because
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
if
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
is
able
to
show
that
they
were
storing
up
this
extra
input
against
a
prospect
of
a
price
hike
in
the
future
or
because
they
were
out
trying
to
get
enough
volume
for
some
promotion
for
a
customer
that
was
going
to
significantly
increase
their
purchases,
then
you'd
have
a
different
kind
of
case.
we
have
a
situation
where
they
warehoused
large,
unprecedentedly
high
volumes
of
lumber
because
they--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--we
did.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well,
as
to
the
paid
a
higher
price
than
necessary,
the
language
we
would
suggest
could
be
used
in
another
case
and
passed
on
by
this
court,
is
the
following:
paid
a
higher
price
than
necessary
to
move
the
log
market
to
higher
levels
than
otherwise
would
have
prevailed
in
order
to
injure
competition.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
but
here--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--we
don't
have
a
situation
here,
justice
breyer,
where
weyerhaeuser
presented
evidence
that
they
were
the
most
efficient
and
able
to
pay
higher
prices.
weyerhaeuser
presented
no
quantitative
evidence
that
it
was
the
lowest
cost
producer
in
terms
of
costs--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--well,
one
of
the
reasons
that
one
can't
go
in
this
direction
here,
brooke
group
was
a
pricing
only
case.
as
the
briefs
make
clear
and
the
decision
made
clear,
if
that
had
been
a
standard
monopolization
case
it
would
have
been
out
the
door
on
summary
judgment
because
the
defendant
was
a
12
percent
player.
they
had
no
prospect
of,
of
attempted
or
monopolization,
a
viable
monopolization
claim.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
weyerhaeuser's
pricing
conduct,
deliberately
and
artificially
pushing
the
market
up
through
a
variety
of
mechanisms,
was
also
interconnected
and
linked
to
complementary
other
conduct
that
we
think
set
the
table
for
the
effectiveness
of
their
strategy
in
elevating
the
log
market
that
our
client
was
participating
in.
bear
in
mind
that,
that
at
ja
901
we
have
a
weyerhaeuser
document
showing
that
very
significant
foreclosure
from
their
exclusive
contracts
in
the,
in
oregon
for
example,
this
is
a
document
that
shows
that
62
percent
of
the
market
was
covered
through
either
exclusive
purchase
arrangements
between
weyerhaeuser
and
large
landowners,
or
non-efficiency-based
trades
were
the,
were
linked
to
the
exchange
of
the
alder
sawlogs
from
that
landowner.
only
33
percent
according
to
ja
901
show,
in
oregon,
was
projected
to
be
open
market
bidding.
weyerhaeuser
acquired,
when
it
was
then
at
a
65
percent
market
share,
acquired
the
dominant
seller,
a
built-in
monopsony
in
british
columbia
and
it's
five,
15
to
20-year
exclusive
forest
licenses.
that
kind
of
foreclosure,
linked
with
the
anticompetitive
behavior
they
engaged
in
that
was
a
variety
of
bidding
practices,
some
of
it
was
overbuying,
some
of
it
was
manipulating
bidding
back
and
forth,
and
then
putting
the
last
bid
in
terms
of
that
cost
on
the
other
side.
i
think
it's
important,
i'd
like
to
shift
to
the
instruction
again,
and
make
the
point
that
weyerhaeuser
never
gave
either
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
or
the
district
judge
the
opportunity
to
consider
a
different
instruction
than
was
given
here.
and
the
fact
that's
demonstratively
shown
if
one
looks
at
page
43
of
their
opening
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
ninth
circuit
they
only
took
the
position
in
the
bulk
of
their
brief
that
they
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
brooke
group.
as
to
the
ground
or
the
contention--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--i
didn't
quite
hear
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
we
do
not
agree
as
to
the
evidence
in
this
case.
we
have
evidence
in
this
case
that
we
cited
to
in
our
brief
that
when
you
adjust,
as
against
the
longview
mill
which
our
client
was
literally
right
next
door
to,
when
you
adjust
for
the
fact
that
weyerhaeuser
supplied
half
of
the
raw
material
needs
of
the
longview
mill
at
way
below
market
transfer
prices,
when
you
adjust
those
to
the
average
price
they
paid
other
third
parties
for
logs,
the
longview
mill
ran
at
a
loss
for
a
significant
part
of
the,
of
the
predation
period.
we
do
have
the
evidence
in
this
case
to
contend--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--if
brooke
group
is
applied--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--that's
correct.
we
withdrew
the
request
for
a
brooke
group
instruction.
but
to
finish
my
point
about
the
fact
that
this--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--if
the
court
concludes
the
brooke
group
applies
to
this
case,
then
the
instruction
was
incomplete,
it
was
not
correct,
and
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
remand
and
a
chance
to
retry
the
case.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
well,
the
recoupment
is
not
in
the
output
end
of
things.
the
recoupment
is
the
opportunity
to
drive
log
costs
down
to
recoup
the
extra
costs
you
pay
during
the
predatory
period.
and
we
had
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
former
executive
from
weyerhaeuser
testified
that
they
had
used
this
strategy
multiple
times,
that
when
it
was
questioned
by
some
in
top
management
that
the
head
of
a
division
would
always
say
once
we
either
acquire
or
get
rid
of
a
competitor,
we
will
recoup
those
costs
many
fold.
that's
at
ja
260,
cliff
chulos.
we
also
had
at
ja
903
a
planning
document
in
2001
where
weyerhaeuser
was
showing
in
that
powerpoint
chart
the
expectation
that
log
prices
would
be
going
down
in
'01,
'02,
'03,
and
for
every
2
percent
change
downward
it
was
an
extra
$2
million
in
profits
to
the
bottom
line.
there
was
no
plan
to
pass
on
the
benefits
of
those
lower
input
prices
to
consumers.
obvious
consumer
lack
of
benefit
in
that
situation.
also
as
to
recoupment,
if
you
look
at
ja
831
to
95,
which
are
the
year-end
financials
for
the
weyerhaeuser
alder
mills
in
oregon,
washington
and
bc
during
a
roughly
four-year
period,
you
see
a
monu...
a
huge
price
differential
between
the
prices
in
british
columbia
and
those
prevailing
in
oregon
and
washington.
we
think
there
was
every
expectation
on
management's
part
to
drive
the
prices
down
to
the
levels
that
prevailed
in
british
columbia,
which
works
out
to
about
$40
million
a
year,
way
way
above
the
amount
they
were
spending
in
this
predatory
scheme
predominantly
in
oregon
and
washington,
because
there
is
no
competition
in
british
columbia.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
they
never
preserved
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
dictum
stated
was
as
a
whole
sufficient
to
guide
the
jury
as
to
a
definition
of
anticompetitive
conduct.
at
page
43
of
their
brief
after
quoting
this
paragraph
they
so
criticize,
they
note,
although
that
statement
of
the
law...
this
is
43
of
the
ninth
circuit
brief,
not
the
blue
brief
that
you
have...
although
that
statement
of
the
law
may
have
been
acceptable
when
reed
brothers
was
decided,
it
is
not
in
the
wake
of
brooke
group
for
reasons
explained
above.
the
point
here
is
that
they
never
made
any
charge
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
instruction
was
flawed
independent
of
brooke
group.
now
we
concede,
if
brooke
group
applies,
the
instruction
was...
was...
is
wrong,
and
the
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded.
but
the
second
point
that
they
try
to
make
in
their
briefing
is
not
properly
preserved.
and
in
fact,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
they
contributed
to
the
linguistic
framework
of
this
instruction
in
a
very
significant
way.
first--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--well,
they
have
also
asserted
in
their
briefing
that
as
an
independent
ground
for
reversal,
the
instruction
was
so
standardless
that
the
verdict
cannot
stand.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
these
facts
in
terms
of
the
way
they
contributed
to
it.
they
submitted
jury
instructions
just
like
us
based
upon
the
aba
model
instructions,
theirs
are
at
ja
97
to
122,
that
used
the
words
outside
of
this
paragraph
that
we
are
talking
about,
fair,
reasonable
or
necessary
18
times.
they
showed
up
19
times
in
those
instructions.
in
their
opening
and
closing--
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
--right.
mr.
michael
e.
haglund
that's
correct.
and
i
suggest
that
you
look
to
the
type
of
formulation
i
gave
a
little
earlier
where
you're
looking
at
how
much
did
the
defendant
push
the
market
to
levels
that
are
above
where
it
otherwise
would
have
been.
it's
not
too
far
from
the
test
that
is
proposed
by
the
state
at
page
29
of
their
brief
where
they
suggest
it's,
that
the
conduct
be
measured
by
whether
it
raised
the
price
that
the
buyer's
rivals
had
to
pay
for
the
input
beyond
a
level
that
could
be
justified
or
explained
by
other
market
or
exogenous
factors
and
substantially
affected
the
ability
of
the
buyer's
rivals
to
compete
for
the
input.
the
eight
states,
all
of
which
have
concerns
both
as
sellers
into
these
vulnerable
resource
markets
and
for
citizens
and
companies
in
their
own
resource
state,
laden
states,
whether
it's
mineral,
whether
it's
agriculture,
they
have
that
concern
and
they've
offered
that
test
that's
not
too
far
from
what
i
posited
as
a
way
to
improve
the
instruction
that
weyerhaeuser
invited.
i'd
like
to
make
one
further
point
on
that
subject
and
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
opening
statement
of
their
counsel,
the
closing,
he
used
that
very
language.
they
were
going
to
put
on
witnesses
who
would
all
state
that
they
never
bought
more
than
they
needed,
they
never
paid
more
than
necessary.
that
same
litany
was
put
to
13
different
witnesses.
thank
you.
