justice

i
assume
it's
a
benefit
to
consumers
if
the
supply
of
the
needed
goods
is
increased
because
of
higher
prices
being
paid
for
those
needed
goods,
and
i
assume
when
a
higher
price
is
paid,
more
of
those
goods
will
be
forthcoming,
which
will
benefit
consumers
who
want
those
goods.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
it
could
lead
to
lower
consumer
prices
too.
if
you
have
a
firm
that
has
developed
a
new,
a
new
technique
for
processing
the
logs,
and
it
can
process
them
cheaper
and
faster,
and
sell
them
for
a
lower
price
but
in
greater
volume,
and
thereby
make
even
more
profit,
that
firm
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
for
those
logs,
even
though
it
would
sell
them
for
less
than
competitors
might
sell
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
we
do
in
the
correlative
situation
where
there
is
an
allegation
of
predatory
selling
rather
than
predatory
buying
if
you
had
the
same
situation
posed
by
justice
stevens?
namely
evidence
that
you're
trying
to
drive
the
competitor
out
of
business,
wouldn't
that
establish
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
could
have
a
company
that
has
a
dynamite
evidence
of
seeking
to
monopolize
and
the
means
that
they
choose
is
just
idiotic.
for
example,
they
say,
we're
going
to
try
to
get
a
monopoly
by
buying
these
logs
at
a
lower
price
as,
at
as
low
a
price
as
possible.
you
would
have
the
two
elements,
monopoly
power,
intent
to
monopolize,
but
you
wouldn't
have
an
act
that
constitutes
anticompetitive
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
you're
asserting
is
the
case
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
ultimately
a
jury
question,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
question
was
not
put
to
the
jury,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
losing
you.
what's
the
second
point
that
they're
trying
to
make
besides
the
fact
that
this
didn't
conform
to
brooke
group?
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
brooke
group.
