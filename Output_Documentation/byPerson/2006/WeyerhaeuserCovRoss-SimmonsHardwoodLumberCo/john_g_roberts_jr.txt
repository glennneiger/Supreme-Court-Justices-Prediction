chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
in
case
05-381
weyerhaeuser
company
versus
ross-simmons
hardwood
lumber
company.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
a
little
different
here
in
that
in
the
brooke
group
cases,
of
course,
the
alleged
anticompetitive
conduct
was
pricing
too
low,
which
has
at
least
a
direct
benefit
to
consumers
either
in
the
short
term,
certainly
in
the
short
term,
and
arguably
in
the
long-term
as
well,
while
here
that
is
not
the
form
in
which
the
anticompetitive
conduct,
that's
not
the
form
the
anticompetitive
conduct
takes.
so
isn't
that
a
reason
not
to
think
that
we
should
apply
the
brooke
group
test
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
we
ever
identified
that
as
a
benefit
that
the
antitrust
laws
try
to
achieve,
people
get
higher
prices
for
what
they
sell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
brooke
group,
we
said
it's
a
benefit
when
prices
are
low
to
consumers,
and
in
this
other
case
we
said
it's
a
benefit
when
prices
are
high
to
suppliers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
describe
the
hypothetical
justice
stevens
posed
to
your,
your
brother,
would
you
describe
that
as
just
aggressive
bidding?
aggressive
is,
you
know,
it's
kind
of
a
good
term
when
you're
talking
about
competition.
but
what
if
it's
purposely
bidding
higher
than
you
know
your
rival
can
afford?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shanmugam.
mr.
haglund.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
fact
that
the
woodsmen
in
justice
breyer's
story
are
rational
actors
as
well,
and
they
don't
have
to
be
geniuses
to
realize
that
they
are
in
a
better
shape
having
two
buyers
rather
than
just
one.
so
maybe
they
forego
the
extra
50
cents
a
log,
or
whatever...
tree,
it
is
in
the
short
term
and
sell
enough
to
keep
the
other
company
in
business?
i
mean
they
can
make
that
decision
themselves.
or
they
can
make
the
decision
as
rational
actors
that
they
are
better
off
having
more
money
that
they
can
then
use
to
buy
more
alder
saplings
that
they
can
plant
for
the
future.
and
either
way
it
benefits
the
consumers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
if
he
is,
if
he
is
that
rational
and
foresighted,
why
isn't
he
rational
and
foresighted
enough
to
know
that
he
ought
to
be
selling
some
to
the
other,
the
other
processor
even
if
that
processor
is
not
bidding
as
much?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then,
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
remand
on
that
or
not,
given
that
you
withdrew
that
instruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
haglund.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
two
cases
this
morning.
