justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
little
of
an
exaggeration,
though,
to
say
that
epa
has
since
the
issuance
of
the
regulations
always
interpreted
them
the
way
that
you
prefer.
in
fact,
the
director
of
the
psd
program
gave
two
opinions
in
which
he
took
precisely
the
interpretation
that
opposing
counsel
took.
justice
antonin
scalia
rightly
so,
i
think.
i
mean,
it
was
the
earliest,
application
of
the
regulation
by
the
officer
of
the
agency
specifically
in
charge
of
the
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever
the
reason
he
gave,
was
it...
these
opinions
were
out
there
when
the
challenge
to
the
regulations,
in
which
duke
did
not
participate,
when
that
challenge
was
brought,
were
these...
were
those
opinions
already
out
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
and
i
think
you
may
have
the
better
of
the
argument
on
me
on
the
interpretation
of
the
psd
regulations.
but
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
that
companies
can
get
whipsawed.
they
don't
challenge
the
regulations
when
they
come
out
because
as
far
as
they
know,
the
agency
is
interpreting
them
in
a
way
that
they
favor.
and
then
some
years
later,
when
it
turns
out
the
agency
is
using
a
different
interpretation,
you
have
the
jurisdictional
bar.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
wrestled
with
these
things
for
several
days.
it's
disappointing
to
hear
you
tell
us
they're
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
in
deciding
whether
the
regulations
are
reasonable,
however,
is
it
proper
for
a
court
to
take
into
account
that
the
regulations
must
follow
the
prescription
of
the
statute
that
the
psd
definition
be
the
same
as
the
nsps...
what
is
it...
nsps
definition?
i
mean,
that's
a
usual
tool
of
statutory...
or
regulatory
construction.
cannot
a
court
give
great
weight
to
that
in
interpreting
these
ambiguous
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
the
same
argument
has
necessarily
to
be
made,
but
the
question
still
before
us
is
how
you
interpret
the
regulations.
let's
assume
that's
just
a
regulatory
interpretation
question,
it's
not
a
statutory
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
deciding
that,
whatever
was
argued
in
prior
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
necessity
that
the
regulations
comply
with
the
statute.
and
if
they
are
ambiguous,
we
should
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
the
direction
that
it
seems
to
us
would
provide
consistency
with
the
statute.
now
does
that
violate
the
jurisdictional
bar?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
that
rejection
wrong?
because
this
issue
is
still
important
to
me
for
purposes
of
statutory
construction.
is
it
conceivable
that
when
congress
says
the
word
widget
in
this
statute
has
to
mean
the
same
as
the
word
widget
in
the
other
statute,
that
the
agency
can
effectively
frustrate
the
apparent
congressional
intent
by
saying,
oh,
yes,
i
mean,
yes,
that
has
to
mean
the
same
thing,
but
we
can
adopt
regulations
under
one
statute
which
regulations
say
it
means
one
thing,
and
we
can
adopt
regulations
under
another
statute
that
says
it
means
something
else.
i
mean,
to
say
that
they
have
to
mean
the
same
thing
it
seems
to
me
means
that
the
regulations
have
to
say
they
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
does,
but
when
congress
says
the
definition
in
the
two
statutes
has
to
be
the
same,
whatever
choice
the
agency
makes
among
those
options
has
to
be
applied
to
both,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it's
meaningless
to
say
the
definition
has
to
be
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
entirely
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
i'm
curious.
what
happens
if
you
have
a
new
company
that
wasn't
around
when
the
regulation
was
issued?
can
it...
can
it
bring
a
challenge
to
the
conformity
of
the
regulation
to
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
nice
question.
i
mean,
all
you
have
to
do
is
find
a
stalking
horse.
just
have
some
new
company
carry
your
water
for
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was
saying
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
nsps
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
that
that
provision
only
applies
when
there
is
no
sip.
and
that's
not
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
it
seems
to
me
each
part
has
had
different
definitions
and
this
definition
only
applies
to
part
52
which
applies
when
there
is
no
sip.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
it
automatically
applies
when
there
is
a
sip.
justice
antonin
scalia
part
51,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
before
you
get
away
from
this
section
52,
because
i
think
that
is
the
best
section
for
your
case,
52.01(d),
is
there,
is
there
any
sensible
reason
why
you
would
want
to
have
a
different
definition
of
modification
for
non-sip
situations
than
you
would
for
sip
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
occurred
to
me
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
quoting
page
9?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
in
their
reply
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
definitely
no.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
what's
wrong
with
it
is
that
you
could
have
achieved
that
same
result
by
simply
not
saying
that
modification
in
one
program
has
to
mean
the
same
as
modification
in
the
other.
if
you
didn't
say
that,
that
would
be
the
result.
you
give
modification
whatever
meaning
you
think
is
reasonable
here.
you
give
it
whatever
reading
you
think
is
reasonable
in
the
other
place.
but
when
you
say
the
two
have
to
be
the
same,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
something
else
in
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
using
the
same
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
matter
of
a
statute
which
says
it
shall
have
the
same
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
psd?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
one
in
part
52
surely
does.
you
have
to
give
them
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
give
them
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
"rate"
defined?
i'm
still
troubled
by
52.01(b).
where
is...
you
say
"rate"
is
defined.
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
defined.
you
say
it's
just
used
that
way.
