mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
and
misconstrued
the
clean
air
act
in
holding
that
epa
was
required
to
define
the
term
nsps
and
psd
programs,
and
on
the
jurisdictional
point
i'd
like
to
address
the
whipsaw
question,
because
in
fact
it's
quite
clear
that
there's
no
whipsaw
issue
here
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it's
true
that
there
are
those
ambiguous
and
cursory
1981
statements
from
mr.
reich,
who
was
a
subordinate
official
within
epa.
in
1988,
the
administrator
of
epa,
the
head
of
the
agency,
in
the
wepco
decision,
the
applicability
determination,
made
very
clear
what
epa's
position
is
on
the
application
of
the
hours
of
operation
exclusion
and
the
fact
that
this
is
an
annual
tons
per
year
test.
that's
page
44
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
made
that
perfectly
clear
and
it
has
always
been
clear
that
that
is,
in
fact,
the
epa's
official
position
beginning
with
the
1980
preamble.
but
again--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
could
have
been
brought
at
that
time.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
a
challenge
was
brought
on
this
issue
in...
to
the
1980
regulations.
true,
duke
didn't
assert
it,
but
general
motors
and
the
steel
industry
did
assert
in
the
1981
brief
they
filed
in
that
challenge
to
the
1980
rule--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
they
might
have
that
argument,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
challenge
to
the
1980
rules
was
stayed
and
was
not
reopened
until
2003.
in
2003,
duke
and
other
parties
sought
to
reopen
and
were
granted
permission
to
reopen
that
challenge
to
the
1980
rules.
they
filed
a
statement
of
issues
in
1984
and
a
brief
in
1984
challenging
the
regulation
on
the
ground
that
if
epa's
interpretation
was
correct
and
that
it
did
not
require
an
increase
in
maximum
total
achievable
emissions,
as
the
nsps
did,
test
did,
they
argued
that
it
was
invalid.
they
raised
the
very
incorporation
theory
that
they
advance
here,
that
is
the
statutory
argument
that
congress
was
required
to
follow
for
the
psd
regulations
the
same
regulatory
approach
that
the
nsps
regulations
had
followed
in
1977
with
the
hourly
maximum
achievable
test.
they
made
that
very
argument
in
their
brief
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
2004,
the
d.c.
circuit
addressed
and
rejected
that
argument
on
the
merits.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish.
there
are
two
statutory
arguments
here.
one
is
what
i
would
call
the
incorporation
theory.
that
is
the
argument
that
congress
by
borrowing
the
definition,
the
statutory
definition,
also
necessarily
borrowed
and
mandated
adoption
of
the
regulatory
definition
from
the
nsps
program.
that
argument,
the
incorporation
argument,
was
made
by
duke
in
its
brief
in
2004
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
addressed
and
rejected
that
argument
at
pages
17
through
19
of
its
decision
in
its
2005
new
york
decision.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
administrative
law
and
deference
to
agency
decisionmaking
that
when
congress
adopts
an
ambiguous
statutory
phrase
and
charges
the
agency
with
implementing
that
phrase
the
agency
has
discretion,
has
a
delegation
of
rulemaking
authority
and
policymaking
authority
to
choose
from
among
the
various
permissible
interpretations.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
congress
has
not
mandated,
as
it
could
have
done,
that
the
choice
of
the
specific
interpretation
from
among
the
permissible
options
must
be
identical
across
both
programs.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
statutory
definition
is
ambiguous,
but
within
the
limits
of
the
ambiguity
it
imposes
constraints
on
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
the
agency
must
choose
from
among
the
options
that
are
permissible
given
the
range
of
language
that
congress
used.
but
within
that
range
the
agency
has
discretion.
think
of
it
this
way,
your
honor.
if
there
were
no
psd
program,
if
we
were
talking
only
about
the
nsps
program,
congress
gave
an
ambiguous
definition
to
the
agency
the
agency
would
have
discretion
to
adopt
different
tests
for
determining
whether
emissions
increased
for
different
types
of
equipment
even
within
that
single
program,
because
the
statutory
definition
is
ambiguous.
the
statute
therefore
does
not
mandate
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
and
the
agency
in
its
discretion
could
well
determine
that
one
emissions
test
is
appropriate
for
some
types
of
equipment,
another
emissions
test
is
appropriate
for
other
types
of
equipment,
as
long
as
both
of
those
tests
are
within
the
permissible
bounds
of
the
statutory
ambiguity.
the
agency
is
entitled
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
certain
types
of
units,
electric
generating
units
like
those
at
issue
in
this
case,
that's
correct.
they
would
not
be
identical
under
the
proposal,
but
would
be
similar.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
2005
proposal
that
you're
referring
to
is
only
a
proposal,
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking.
it
has
not
been
adopted.
so
the
rules
as
they
exist
today
are
the
same
as
the
ones
we're
talking
about,
although
there
was
a
modification
in
2002.
but
in
any
event,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
conduct
that
occurred
from
1988
through
2000
with
respect
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
is
civil
enforcement
proceedings,
your
honor.
there
are
various
remedies,
injunctive
relief
and
civil
penalties
where
appropriate,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
an
advisory
opinion.
the
court
is
simply
precluded
from
considering
a
challenge
that
would
invalidate
the
regulation
because
that
is
the
determination
congress
made
in
requiring
pre-enforcement
review
to
avoid
the
problem
of
inconsistent
determinations
and
circuit
conflicts
and
700
district
judges
potentially
construing
the
statute
in
different
ways
and
tying
epa's
hands.
the
congress
made
that
determination.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
quite
common.
it's
quite
common,
your
honor,
in
any
regime
where
review
of
an
agency
decision
is
relegated
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
one
court,
as
it
is
here,
and
enforcement
proceedings
are
brought
in
a
different
court.
hobbs
act
agencies,
their
decisions
are
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
often
enforceable
in
the
district
courts.
the
district
court
cannot
look
behind
the
determination
of
the
agency
to
challenge
its
validity
because
that
rests
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
obviously
there's
a
timing
issue
in
this
statute
as
well
because
of
the
requirement
of
pre-enforcement
review.
whatever...
whatever
concerns
might
be
raised
in
a
situation
where
a
party
could
not
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
challenge
it
at
the
time
it
was
originally
promulgated
are
addressed
by
the
after-arising
provision
in
section
307(b)(1)
which
permits
challenges
that
could
not
have
been
made
within
the
60-day
period
to
be
brought
later
in
appropriate
circumstances.
and
in
any
event,
if
there
were
some
concerns
at
the
outer
limits
of
a
provision
like
this
one,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
where
duke's
challenge,
actual
challenge
to
the
agency
decision,
the
1980
rule,
it
was
heard
in
2005.
and
so
duke
had
more
opportunity
than
you
could
possibly
ask
for
to
understand
exactly
what
epa's
position
was,
understand
exactly
what
the
regulation
meant
and
to
challenge
it
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
did
so
and
it
can't
do
it
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
think
that's
an
unresolved
question.
presumably,
the
argument--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
presumably
the
argument
would
be
that
the
creation
of
the
company
and
the
first
applicability
of
the
regulations
to
it
is
an
after-arising
ground.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
certainly
it's
not
presented
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
could
seek
a
determination
of
non-applicability,
but...
and
it
could
obtain
judicial
review
of
that
determination.
but
that
would
not
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit
and
would
not
permit
a
challenge
to
the
regulations.
but
they
could
find
a
petition,
they
clearly
could
find
a
petition
for
rulemaking
with
the
epa,
saying
your
regulation
is
invalid,
it's
been
around
for
25
years,
but
it's
still
invalid,
you
need
to
rescind
it,
and
when
the
agency
declined
to
do
that
they
could
then
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
this
completely
speculative
and
hypothetical
situation
were
ever
to
arise,
a
court
might
well
exercise
its
equitable
discretion
to
stay
proceedings
pending
review
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
there
are
several
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all
the
language
of
the
regulation
simply
does
not
support
that
interpretation.
what
the
regulation
says
is
that
hours
of...
a
change
in
hours
of
operation
is
not
a
physical
change.
fine.
but
we
have
a
physical
change
here.
it
is
undisputed
that
duke
made
physical
changes
to
its
facilities,
major
modifications,
sort
of
using
that
term
in
the
non-regulatory
sense,
but
substantial
replacements
of
physical
equipment
at
the
facilities.
so
physical
change
has
occurred.
the
hours
of
operation
exclusion,
therefore,
has
no
longer
any
relevance
because
it
applies
only
at
the
physical
change
step
of
the
analysis.
there
has
been
a
physical
change
here
regardless
of
whether
hours
of
operation
changed
or
not.
therefore,
the
hours
of
operation
exclusion
no
longer
applies.
the
next
question
is
whether
the...
if
the
physical
change
that
did
occur
resulted
in
a
significant
net
emissions
increase.
here
it
did
under
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations
and
under
the
test
that
epa
applies.
it
is
true
that
1981
they
were
arguably
mistaken
to
the
extent
one
can
discern
what
the,
mr.
reich
was
actually
saying,
they
seem
to
be
simply
a
mistake
in
interpretation.
but
in
1988,
the
administrator
of
the
agency,
the
head
of
the
agency,
made
very
clear
epa's
position,
the
very
same
position
it
is
taking
here
today
on
the
hours
of
operation
exclusion.
the
first
circuit
in
the
puerto
rican
cement
case,
as
your
honor
knows,
upheld
that
interpretation
in
1989.
the
seventh
circuit
in
footnote
11
in
the
wepco
decision
upheld
that
determination
in
1990.
it
was
restated
by
the
epa
again
and
again
and
it
is
well
established.
thank
you,
your
honor.
