justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
about
an
argument
i
think
they
did
make?
i
think
they
made
this
argument.
on
page
26
of
your
brief,
i
think
it's
explained
well.
you
set
out
the
regs
and
the
reg
says
that
a
major
modification
is
"any
physical
change
in
the
method
of
operation
that
would
lead
to
a
significant
net
emissions
increase.
"
then
you
have
little
(iii),
which
is
an
exception,
and
it
excepts
a
physical
change
which
leads
to...
is
just
an
increase
in
the
hours
of
operation
or
the
production
rate.
so
that's
out
of
it.
now,
the
question
is
what's
in
it?
if
that's
out
of
it,
what's
in
it?
i
think
what
they've
said
is,
if
you
think
about
that,
we'll
tell
you
what
must
be
out
of
it
is
a
physical
change
that
does
nothing
to
increase
the
capacity,
but
just
means
you
can
run
it
more
hours.
and
they
say
their
proof
of
that
is
that
that
was
the
epa's
interpretation
for
years
and
years
and
years.
indeed,
we
did
what
we
did
thinking
that
was
it.
and
then
after
we
did
what
we
did,
they
pulled
the
rug
out
from
under
us
and
said
no,
that
isn't
it;
now
it
means
any
physical
change,
like
you
change
a
nut,
or
a
bolt,
or
a
tube,
even
though
there's
no
increased
capacity
to
emit
more.
it's
just
you
run
it
more
hours.
now,
that
they
say
is
basically
unfair,
it's
not
what
this
reg
has
been
about.
and
they
made
that
argument,
according
to
them,
very
strongly
and
the
fourth
circuit
took
the
argument
and
changed
it
all
around
and
made
some
propositions
of
law
that
it's
hard
for
even
them
to
defend.
all
right.
now,
that's
what
i
think,
that's
what
i
think
is
lying...
maybe
that's
lying
at
the
heart
of
it.
and
if
it
is,
what
do
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
looks
like...
i
went
back
and
read
the
puerto
rico
cement
case.
and
it
certainly
looks
as
if...
though
the
issue
was
somewhat
different.
it
looks
as
if
the
interpretation
that
the
epa
is
taking
there
is
not
consistent
with
what
you
are
reading
now
and
is
consistent
with
what
they're
saying
today.
and
that
was
in
1988-89,
i
guess.
they
must
have
been
starting
on
that
in
'87.
so
it
seemed
to
me
we
have
a
mixed
bag.
some
people
were
saying
the
one
thing.
some
people
were
saying
the
other
thing.
and
the
later
in
time
seems
to
be
the
puerto
rico
cement.
and
that
was
at
least
17
years
ago.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
analysis
which
was
probably
pretty
much
based
on
what
they
said,
i
think
was
that
the
reason
there
was
increased
potential
here
to
pollute,
was
really
because
this
change
would
permit
the
plant
to
be
run
more
intensively
or
more
hours,
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
we
didn't
address
it.
i'm
not
taking
it
as
evidence
of
that.
i'm
taking
it
as
evidence
that
the
epa
then
had
a
basic
position
similar
to
what
they
have
now.
that's
what
i'm
using
it
as
a
basis
for
thinking
that
they
were
not
saying
to
have
a
change,
the
word
"change"
includes
only
a
change
in
physical
facilities
that
increases
the
amount
of
emission
per
hour.
am
i
right?
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
then
they'll
say
your
argument
here,
even
if
you
are
right,
i
think
they
think
you're
wrong...
but
even
if
you're
right,
they'll
say
well,
that's
an
argument
that
it
is
arbitrary,
capricious
abuse
of
discretion
for
them
to
change
horses
in
the
middle
of
the
stream,
i.e.,
for
them
to
take
an
interpretation
of
a
reg
that
was
longstanding
and
without
adequate
notice
and
comment
and
so
forth
radically
reverse
that
interpretation.
now
that's
not
the
issue
in
front
of
us
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say
because
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
go
really
on
that,
it
went
on
some
statutory
thing,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
obvious
reason
to
do
it
is,
i
guess
you
have
an
area
of
the
country,
let's
say,
which
is
quite
clean
in
the
air.
and
there
is
a
power
plant.
and
what
somebody
works
out,
which
is
normal,
is
demand
for
electricity
is
increasing.
and
so
what
we
will
do
is
we're
going
to
take
these
turbines
and
system,
and
we're
going
to
change
it
really
radically.
it
doesn't
produce
one
more
particle
per
hour,
but
now
we
can
run
it
24
hours
a
day
and
previously
we'd
run
it
12
hours
a
day.
so
there's
going
to
be
twice
as
much
pollution
in
the
air.
now
the
whole
idea
of
the
psd
system
is
you
don't
have
twice
as
much
pollution
in
the
air,
and
i
guess
that's
why
they
wanted
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
can
use
the
same
word,
you
can
apply
the
same
word
in
different
places
differently,
depending
on
what
your
basic
object
is
in
the
different
place.
it's
very
hard
to
say
what
kind
of
modification
might
exist
over
here,
there,
the
other
place.
and
you
put
your
finger
on
a
very
difficult
question
for
power
companies,
because
those
turbines
do
go
at
different
amounts
of
rates
and
so
forth
during
a
day,
during
a
month,
during
a
year,
so
it's
hard
for
them.
therefore,
you
have
a
complex
definition.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
the
language,
i
don't
see
anywhere
in
the
statute
where...
the
words
of
modification
are,
it's
a
physical
changing
or
change
in
a
method
of
operation
which
increases
the
amount
of
any
air
pollutant.
now
those
words,
"physical
change
which
increases
the
amount
of
any
air
pollutant.
"
could
mean
different
things
in
different
places.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
in
the
statute
that
they
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
do
have
a
brief
here.
you
have
a
brief
filed
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
is
brief
for
industry
petitioners
on
actual
emissions
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
throughout
that
brief
it
refers
again
and
again
to
the
problem,
their
proposed
reg
is
not
taking,
i.e.,
the
potential
capacity,
which
is
change
the
machine
so
it
puts
out
more
per
minute
or
whatever,
but
rather,
it's
using
actual
emissions
even
though
you
don't
change
the
capacity
of
the
machine.
there's
a
whole
brief
on
that.
so
you
already
argued
that
whole
brief,
that
what
they
were
doing
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
as
being
outside
the
statute
at
that
time,
and
you
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
was
just
thinking,
then
you're
left
with
what
you
called
the
weak
argument,
arbitrary,
capricious,
et
cetera,
because
i
don't
see
how
you
make
the
stronger
one,
what
you
think
is
stronger,
since
you
made
it
before,
or
a
version
of
it
before
the
d.c.
circuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
collateral
estoppel,
but
you
know,
i'd
be
repeating
myself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
is.
