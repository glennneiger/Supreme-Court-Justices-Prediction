mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
am
inclined
instead
of
starting
with
the
jurisdictional
issue
to
focus
initially
on
the
regulatory
history
immediately
in
the
wake
of
the
1980
rules.
because
it
seems
to
me
it
is
very
clear
that
the
understanding
of
everyone
in
the
industry,
outside
the
industry,
from
1980,
candidly
well
beyond
1988
all
the
way
up
until
1999,
was
that
these
regulations
didn't
apply
under
any
circumstances
in
the
absence
of
an
increase
in
the
capacity.
and
you
had
to
demonstrate
that
there
would
be
an
increase
in
the
hourly
rate
of
the
emissions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
confirm
precisely
that
interpretation.
that's
exactly
why
ge
went
to
mr.
reich
and
asked
for
a
determination
of
applicability,
and
was
told
categorically
psd
applicability
is
determined
by
evaluating
any
change
in
emissions
rates
caused
by
the
conversion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
heard
mr.
donahue,
he
was
talking
about
wepco.
understand
the
context
of
wepco.
wepco
was
a
situation
where
every
one
of
the
changes
was
a
modification
within
the
meaning
of
nsps.
and
then
the
question
is
were
they
also
modification...
major
modifications
within
the...
within
the
meaning
of
the
psd.
and
that's
what
they
analyzed.
so
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
argument
we've
been
making
which
is
what
is
a
modification.
the
only
statements
that
i
know
of
that
are
out
there
are
the
two
reich
statements
which
i
just
quoted
to
you,
says
exactly
our
interpretation.
but
even
more
powerful
at
least
in
my
view
is
the
quotation
from
the
amicus
brief
from
the
state
of
alabama
and
the
12
states
that
relied
on
the
region
4
statement
and
that's
on
pages
7
and
8
of
that
amicus
brief
and
the
answer,
the
question
is...
you
know...
how
do
you
determine
what
is
a
modification?
you
know
does
something
that
doesn't
increase
the
hours,
the
emissions
per
hour,
constitute
it?
it
says
no.
since
the
modification
does
not
cause
any
increase
in
the
hourly
particulate
emissions,
no
increase
in
annual
emissions
should
be
calculated.
they
could
not
have
said
that
any
more
clearly
than--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
the...
it
is
the
chief
of
the
air
and
waste
management
division,
james
wolburn,
giving
guidance
to
region
4.
region
4
is
not
only
alabama,
it
is
also
north
carolina
and
south
carolina.
and
then,
in
the
wake
of
this,
right?
1982,
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
submit
their
sips
and
in
their
sips,
certainly
the
south
carolina
sip
expressly
incorporates
the
concept
of
modification.
north
carolina
a
little
less
expressly
incorporates
the
entirety
of
the
regulatory
scheme
under
title
50...
under
part
51
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
puerto
rico
cement
is
a
somewhat
complicated
problem.
because
what
you
are
dealing
with
there
is
the
elimination
of
two
existing
units,
the
two
kilns,
and
a
replacement
with
a
brand-new
unit,
which
would
have
been
a
modification
under
any...
i
think
under
anybody's
theory,
because
there
would
have
been
an
increase
in
the
hourly
emissions
anyway.
so
it
would
have
been
a
nsps
subject
to
the
psd.
it
didn't
get
analyzed
that
way
but
the
truth
is
it
would
have
been
fully...
the
way
that
decision
came
out
would
have
been
exactly
consistent
with
the
way
that
they
analyzed
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
was
based
on
the
question
of
involving
you
know,
normal
operations
or
non-normal
operations.
the
court
really
didn't
have
to
address...
and
i
don't
think
did
address
the
question
of
how
do
you
relate--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
they
were
really
arguing
that
particular
point.
i
mean,
that's
not
the
way
i
would
have
read
the
argument
that
epa
was
making.
but,
and
the
bottom
line
is
they
didn't
address
this
issue
in
wepco.
to
the
extent
they
came
close
to
addressing
this
issue
in
wepco
they
lost
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
because
wepco
adopted
an
interpretation
that's
much
closer
to
what
we
are
asking
for.
the
answer
given
on
the
other
side
at
this
point,
that
we
should
have...
we
should
have
sought
a
determination.
well,
the
problem
with
that,
of
course,
is
every
one
of
these
projects
was
being
inspected.
the
record
is
replete
with
examples
from
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
and
epa
inspectors
on
site
looking
at
every
one
of
these
projects.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
is
the
issue
in
front
of
you,
i
believe.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
but
that's
the
opinion.
that's
not
the
judgment.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
this
enforcement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if...
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
predicate
of
the
question,
justice
stevens.
which
question
are
you
asking?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
see.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
our
position
would
be
no.
that
would
have
been
an...
inappropriate
under
the
rationale
of
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
actually
we're
making
both
arguments.
our
basic
argument
is
that
all
along,
they
have
interpreted
it
in
a
certain
way.
and
then
19
years
later,
they
reversed
course.
and
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
justice
breyer,
and
it
is
a
basis
on
which
to
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
exactly
what
they
have
to
be
arguing.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
cannot
be
what
307(b)(1)
means.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
a
great
question.
should
we
have
raised
this
in
1980,
1992,
2000?
when
were
we
supposed
to
bring
this
up?
and
the
truth
is
in
1980
we
interpreted
this
statute,
the
regulation,
exactly
the
same
way
epa
did.
it
would
have
been
silly
for
us
to
raise
that.
it
is
true
that
this
issue
comes
up
25
years
later
in
a
bizarre
proceeding.
but
that's
not
what
307(b)(2)
is
all
about.
it
says
you
are
precluded
from
making
a
challenge
in
an
enforcement
action
if
the
action
of
the
administrator
was
subject
to
challenge.
well,
the
action
of
the
administrator
was
not
subject
to
challenge
in
1980.
and
when
we
did
have
the
subsequent
rulemaking--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
well,
i
think
that,
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
saying.
but
you
know,
judge
tatel,
with
all
due
respect
to
him,
is
dead
wrong.
because
the
interpretation
of
modification
under
nsps
and
under
the
regulatory
psd
was
identical.
the
regulations
couldn't
be
any
clearer
in
that
regard
because
if
you
look
at
15a
of
our
appendix,
you
know,
the
modification,
this
is
the
nsps
definition...
i'm
sorry,
better
go
back
a
page.
17a.
60.14
modification
defines
emission
rate
and
the
emission
rate
is
expressed
as
kilogram
per
hour.
so
that
is
absolutely
clear
that
that
is
the
nsps...
dobbs
modification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
the
nsps
section.
then
you
go
two
pages
earlier
to
15a
and
you
have
the
psd
regulatory
definition,
and
it
comes
right
back
to
emission
rate,
or
the
regulatory
history
that
says
the
emission
rate
as
used
in
this
provides
is
identical--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
in
the
first
place
it
would
apply
in
at
least
south
carolina
immediately
because
there
is
a
sip
that
incorporates
exactly
the
same
language.
and
second
of
all,
the
notion
that
this
regulation
is
inoperative
on
one
side
and
fully
operative
on
the
other
side
make
no
sense.
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
recognize
that
modification
is
the
trigger
for
construction
which
is
in
part
51(2)
and
that
that
incorporates
this
entire
modification
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
way
that
would
apply--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
go
back
to
then...
you
have
to
go
back
to
12(a),
i
think
it
is
where
we
talk
about
the
interpretation
and
we
get
to
construction.
this
is
(b)(8),
construction
means
a
modification,
okay,
of
an
emissions
unit.
so
that...
and
modification,
if
it
is
undefined
in
title
51,
right?
according
to
15.100,
means
whatever
it
means
under
the
statute.
so
that
just
takes
you
back
to
the
statute.
and
this
is
the
interpretation
under
the
statute.
the
52
interpretation
is
also
an
interpretation
under
the
statute.
so
it
is
completely
circular
and
brings
you
right
back
to
the
same
definition.
i
agree
by
its
terms
it
doesn't
apply
to
51.
but
going
through
the
definitional
provision
in
part
51
through
the
definition
of
the
trigger
for
construction,
which
is
modification,
it
takes
you
right
back
to
the
same
meaning
of
the
same
provisions.
so
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two.
and
to
me,
it
is
really
critical.
and
it
seems
to
me
there
are
sort
of
two
points
to
make
here.
one
is
nobody
on
the
petitioner's
side
of
this
case
answers
the
state...
the
dozen
states
who
say
we
relied
upon
you
when
we
adopted
these
sips.
we
realized
that
you
are
asking
us
to
take
on
enormous
burdens.
and
you
should
have
told
us
that
before
we
went
down
this
path
in
the
first
place.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
absolutely
not.
i
mean,--
you
would...
you...
there
is
no
rational--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i
have
not
heard
the
other--
side
make
an
argument
that
there
is
a
rational
distinction
between
the
two.
and
the
truth
is
if
epa
wanted
to
achieve
what
it
thought
it
was
achieving,
that
is
to
eliminate
the
concept
of
modification,
what
it
should
have
done
is
two
things.
it
should
have...
it
should
have
deleted--
52.01.
and
it
should
have
adopted
the
proposed
regulation
that
it
didn't
adopt
from
the
1979
regs.
this
is
on
page
9
of
their
brief.
this
statement
is
astonishing
to
me.
"the
term
major
modification
serves
as
the
definition
of
modification
or
modified
when
used
in
the
act
in
reference
to
a
major
stationary
source.
"
if
they
had
adopted
that
regulation
in
1980,
i
wouldn't
had
to
litigate
this
issue
25
years
later.
we
would
have
litigated
this
question
in
1980
because
then
we
would
have
said
that's
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme
because
you're
not
entitled.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
page
9
of
their
reply
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
sg's
reply
brief,
i
apologize.
the
gray
brief.
where
they
seek
to
get
some
support
for
the
idea
that
modification
was
dropped
out
of
this
analysis.
but
the
truth
is,
that
was
a
proposed
rule
that
would
have
done
exactly
what
they
say
that
the
1980
rule
did
without
adopting
that
particular
regulation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
substantively
different?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think
that
would
be
impermissible--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
i
don't
understand
how
it's
possible
that
congress
says
in
the
statute
that
you
take
the
nsps
trigger...
remember,
this
is
not
just
some
random
definition
we're
talking
about.
construction
is
the
trigger
for
this
part
of
this
entire
regulatory
scheme,
and
modification
is
the
trigger,
and
say
it
is
as
defined
in,
and
they
did
it
twice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
answer
is
no.
[laughter]
i
thought
i
said
that
first.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
a
no
with
some
emphasis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
all
of
it?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
room
within
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
i
think
as
long
as
you
maintain
consistency
between
the
two,
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
discretion
for--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
premise
of
that
is,
the
real
question
is,
if
congress
had
meant
that,
why
would
congress
have
adopted
the
same
word,
modification,
as
the
construction
trigger
that
existed
in
nsps?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
by
the
time
the
statute
came
up
for
review
by
congress,
and
the
psd
program,
the
new
source
review,
there
was
already
a
very
extensive
regulatory
history
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
"modification".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
it
also
seems
to
me,
justice
breyer,
it
clearly
creates
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
epa
to
be
very
explicit
if
it's,
in
fact,
going
to
do
what
you
say
it's
going
to
do.
you
don't
go
about
saying
i
am
going
to
define
modification
in
one
statute
fundamentally
different
from
the
way
i
define
modification
in
another
statute
without
discussing
the
word
modification.
and
to
put
this
in
context,
you'll
remember,
these
regulations
were
adopted
in
the
wake
of
the
alabama
power
decision.
alabama
power
didn't
deal
with
the
issue
of
modification.
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
nobody
had
challenged
modification's
definition.
the
hourly
emissions
rate
was
a
perfectly
valid
one.
what
the
court
in
alabama
power
said
is,
you
can't
use
this
threshold
for
major
modification.
and
then
the
case...
so
then
the
matter
comes
back,
and
if
epa
immediately
adopts
a
new
set
of
regulations
that
deal
what,
with
what?
major
modification,
not
with
modification.
and
then
they
go
through
this
entire
elaborate
analysis
of
major
modification,
none
of
which,
candidly,
do
we
challenge.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
their
interpretation
of
the
concept
of
major
modification.
if
anybody
does,
my
guess
is
the
state
environmental
groups
would.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah.
and
if
the
solicitor,
and
if
epa
had
enacted
the
regulation
that
they
proposed
but
didn't
enact,
that
says
major
modification
means
modification,
then
we
might
have
an
argument
there.
but
the
concept
that
when
you
have
modification
as
a
core
baseline
construction...
i
mean
trigger
for
the
applicability
of
this
portion
of
the
scheme,
and
then
you
take
that
same...
and
you
not
only
do
it
once
but
you
do
it
twice,
and
you
do
it
in
the
context
of
an
entire
regulatory
scheme
that
was
designed
to
implement
this
statutorily...
or
implement
this
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
you
have
congress
saying
well,
you
didn't
get
that
right,
but
you
did
get
this
right,
and
they
leave
this
language
exactly
in
the
way
it
is,
the
only
fair
inference
you
can
draw
from
that,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
where
it
says
in
the
statute
is
where
it
makes
this
specific
cross-reference,
because
if
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
get
that
definition,
all
they
had
to
do
was
use
the
word
modification.
they
didn't
have
to
use
modification
as
defined--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
a
general
principle
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
but
the
general
principle
is
that
if
the
same
language
is
used
in
two
different
portions,
you
presume
they
have
the
same
meaning.
when
you
go
beyond
that...
because
otherwise,
their
interpretation
rendered
superfluous
the
specific
cross-references
to
as
defined
in
and
as
used
in;
and
while
i
know
some
don't
like
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
that
they
had
in
mind,
and
regulatory
history
as
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
depends
on
which
general
principle,
i
suppose
you're
talking
about.
i'm
not
relying
on
the
mere
presumption.
i
think
this
is
much
stronger
than
the
mere
presumption.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
you
read
it
in
context,
when
you
recognize
that
what
congress
was
doing
is
adopting
a
statutory
scheme
that
overlays
on
a
regulatory
scheme
that
was
well
established
with
very
specific
meanings,
and
where
congress
quite
clearly
picked
and
chose...
i
think
that's
the
way
to
say
it...
from
the
regulatory
scheme,
and
said
we'll
take
these
and
not
take
those,
and
has
a
provision
at
the
end...
168
says,
all
the
regulations
remain
in
effect
until
they
get
changed
at
some
point,
suggesting--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
it
would
not
be
nearly
as
strong
as
it
is.
we
would
still
have
a
presumption--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
if
i
have
to
go
quite
that
far
because
i
have
more
evidence
than
that
in
this
particular
case,
because
i
have
the
fact
that
they
say
as
used
in,
which
suggests
that
it's
more
than
just
a
definitional
point.
we
do
have
a
legislative
history
that
seems
to
have
in
mind
this
regulatory
background;
and
we've
been
told
by
epa
that
when
congress
incorporated
modification,
it
really
did
incorporate
that
luggage,
baggage
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
do
endorse
it.
the
only
question
i
have...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
has
to
be...
that
every
word
has
to
be
identical
in
the
two
provisions,
but
i
do
think
they
have
to
be
congruent.
and
so,
that's
the
strong
version
of
our
argument,
and
that's
pretty
close
to
where
the
fourth
circuit
was.
the
weaker
version
of
our
argument,
which
gets
i
think
some
mileage
on
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
part
of
the
argument,
is
at
a
minimum,
if
congress
adopts
as
the
trigger
point
the
same
word
in
two
statutes,
and
epa
then
purports
to
be
implementing
that
statute,
it
has
some
obligation
to
explain
how
it
is
that
they're
doing
a
180
with
respect
to
the
term
modification.
and
the
reason--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
they
owe
us
some
responsibility
to
explain,
how
do
you
not
follow
that
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
could
they
have
gotten
away
with
that?
i
mean,
that
would
have
been
a
much
stronger
argument.
it
seems
to
me
the
better
argument,
and...
but
see,
the
point
here
is
if
they
had
done
that,
or
if
they
had
done
what
they
proposed
in
1979,
which
is
just
to
simply
redefine
major
modification
to
be
modification,
then
we
would
have
taken
that
issue
directly
to
the
d.c.
circuit
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
other
side
has
not
argued
collateral
estoppel,
if
that's
the
argument
you're
trying
to
make,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
have
to
put
that
into
context.
we're
talking
about
a
matter
that
was
closed
for
25
years
and
then
was
reopened.
and
this
argument...
and
it
is
true,
a
variant
of
this
argument
was
made.
i
don't
think
it's
the
full
argument
that
we've
made
before
this
court.
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
but
if
you're
arguing
that
as
a
307(b)
argument,
my
answer
to
that
is
this
is
still
not
action
by
the
administrator
that
would
trigger
a
307(b)
bar.
if
you're
asking
about
collateral
estoppel,
my
argument
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
again,
if
you
are
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel,
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
if
it's
not
collateral
estoppel
and
it's
not
307(b)(2),
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--so
you
are
doing
it
as...
see,
i
don't
think
it...
i
think
if
you
read
307(b)(2)'s
language,
it
talks
about
action
of
the
administrator,
and
what
action
of
the
administrator
are
we,
in
fact,
challenging
here?
nothing.
because
in
our
view,
the
1980
regulation
quite
clearly
says
what
we
want
it
to
say.
the
only
thing
that's
changed
is
that
the
preambles
have
interpreted
the
1980.
we
challenged
that
and
the
d.c.
circuit
said
no,
we're
not
going
to
address
that
issue.
that's
an
issue
when
you
get
back
up,
when
you
get
back
on
your
enforcement
action.
then
you
can
complain
about
that
aspect
of
it.
that
issue
is
not
ripe.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
trying
to
argue
in
this
case.
and
it's
a
variant
of
what
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
long
as
they
are
consistent?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
that
is
my
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
because
there
is
no
action
of
the
administrator
that
we
would
challenge.
the
only
action
of
the
administrator
was
the
1980
regulation,
which
we
interpret
as
not
changing
modification.
if
you
read
52.01(d),
it
clearly
retains
modification.
we
have
no
quarrel,
then,
with
what
the
administrator
did
in
1980.
then
they
adopt
preambles
to
the
subsequent
regs.
we
do
challenge
those,
but
the
d.c.
circuit
said
we're
not
entitled
to
do
that,
that's
got
to
wait
for
an
enforcement
action.
the
only
thing
that's
left
out
there
is
this
sort
of
inchoate
interpretation
by
the
administrator.
but
there's
no
final
action
by
the
administrator
for
us
to
challenge.
then
the
only
question
would
be,
do
we
have
some
obligation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
how
that's
a
final
action.
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
as
this
court
held
in
harrison,
is
not
a
final
action.
so
that
doesn't
trigger
it,
and
i
don't
know
what
else
is
out
there
for
us
to
serve
as
a
hook.
i
would
think
at
a
minimum
the
court
would
want
to
be
very,
very
loathe
to
jump
on
a
expansive
interpretation
of
307(b)
where
it
operates
in
a
context
like
this
as
a
pure
gotcha.
you
adopt
regulations
that
nobody
has
a
quarrel
with,
you
change
the
regulation
afterwards
and
then
you
come
back
and
you
say
you
can't
challenge
it
at
this
point.
that
just
cannot
be
a
sensible
interpretation
of
that
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
fourth
circuit.
thank
you.
