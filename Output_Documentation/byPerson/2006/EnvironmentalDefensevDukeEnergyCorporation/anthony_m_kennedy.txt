but
could
duke
have
had
a
challenge
to
the
1992
or
2000
regulations?
could
they
have
reopened
the
issue
at
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
want
to
jump
ahead
to
the
jurisdictional
argument
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
modification
substantive
point
first,
but
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
duke
should
have
acted
in
1980,
1992
or
2000,
or
all
of
the
above.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
exactly
are
you
seeking
in
these
enforcement
proceedings?
an
injunction
to
install
the
bact
or
criminal
fines
or
civil
fine,
or
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
have
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
there
is
a
legitimate
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agency's
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
statute
with
chevron
deference
and
so
forth
and
the
court
looks
at
it
and
says,
you
know,
i
have
a
real
problem
with
the
way
the
agency
interpreted
the
basic
statute
when
it
first
issued
the
regulation,
the
court
can't
get
into
that
merely
because
the
parties
didn't
present
it
earlier?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court's
almost
issuing
an
advisory
opinion
in
a
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
other
areas
in
the
law
where
courts
have
to
take
as
binding
a
legal
proposition
that
they
think
is
dead
wrong
when
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
what
the
government
is
saying
here
is
that
suppose
the
regulation
can
be
interpreted
to
say
x
or
y.
x
would
hurt
the
company;
y
would
not.
is
the
government
saying,
if
it
is
foreseeable
that
the
agency
might
take
the
unfavorable
position,
you
then
must
challenge
it
in
the
d.c.
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
they
have
said
that
construction
means
both
modification
and
then
come
up
with
a
new
word,
alteration?
because
the
statute
says
the
term
construction
includes
modification,
so
i...
construction
can
be
broader.
could
it
be
an
alteration,
they
would
come
up
with
a
new
term
of
art,
and
add
that--
