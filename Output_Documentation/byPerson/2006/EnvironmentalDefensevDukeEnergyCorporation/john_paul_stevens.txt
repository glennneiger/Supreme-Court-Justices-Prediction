justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
mr.
phillips?
focusing
on
this
question
in
the
amicus
brief
which
the
epa
representative
answered
no.
supposing
the
epa
had
answered
yes
at
that
time.
would
that
have
been
a
permissible
answer
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know...
what's
that,
page
7
and
8
of
the...
of
a
source
to
modified
have
to
have
a
significant
increase
in
the
so2
elements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
answered
no.
you
say
they
were
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking...
want
to
know,
under
the
statute,
could
they
have
answered
yes
and
would
that
have
been
a
permissible
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
not
basically
relying
on
the
fact
that
you
were
misled,
you're
basically
relying
on
the
fact
that
they
have
interpreted
the
statute
incorrectly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
another
sort
of
basic
question?
in
your
view,
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
agency
to
interpret
the
word...
to
adopt
a
regulatory
interpretation
of
the...
in
the
psd
regulations
of
the
word
"modification"
that
was
different
from
the
definition
it
used
under
the
new
source
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
substantively
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
statute
required
the
regulation
to
be
identical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have
been
permissible
for
the
agency
to
adopt
one
definition
for
10
years
and
then
change
the
definition
to
the
other
definition
for
all
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
either
definition
could
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
make
a
kind
of
interesting
argument,
major
modification
is
not
a
subset
of
modification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
are
you
saying
the
statutory
text
in
effect
says
every
regulation
using
the
word
modification
must
employ
the
same
definition,
or
are
you
relying
on
a
general
principle
that
when
the
same
word
is
used
it
should
be
used
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
that
says
that
principle
shall
apply
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
reference
of
modification
as
defined
elsewhere
merely
defines
the
scope
of
the
statutory
meaning.
that's
not
the
same
as
saying
every
regulation
that
is
a
modification
must
be
the
same
no
matter
what
the
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
the
point.
if
instead
of
saying
as
defined
in
x,
the
second
statute
had
merely
quoted
the
same
words
that
were
in
x,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
if
you
used
the
definition
as
defined
in
another
statute,
that
implicitly
says
all
regulations
defining
this
term
must
be
identical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
very
helpful
to
me,
because
the
government
has
accused
you
of
abandoning
the
court
of
appeals
approach
to
the
case,
and
i
think
you're
endorsing
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
meaning
in
(a)
includes
the
same
meaning
as
in
(b).
is
it
not
correct
under
your
view
of
the
statute
that
that
meaning
can
include
either
of
the
two
definitions
that
the
two
regulations
identify?
so
that
either...
whether
you
start
with
(a)
or
the
second
statute,
either
statute
includes
both...
may
include
both
alternative
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
