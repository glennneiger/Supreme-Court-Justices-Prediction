chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
environmental
defense
versus
duke
energy
corporation.
mr.
donahue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
disputed
point,
i
gather,
central
to
the
case,
whether
or
not
the
regulations
measured
psd
emissions
through
that
device
rather
than
the
hourly
emissions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
audacious
statement.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
regulations
are
ambiguous,
then
the
agency
can
interpret
them
in
different
ways
and
can
change
its
interpretation
over
time.
of
course,
what
your
friend
argues
happened
here
is
that
the
agency
changed
its
interpretation
in
the
context
of
an
enforcement
program.
now
accepting
that
premise,
what
is
the...
what
should
duke
have
done
when
that
interpretation
was
changed
in
an
enforcement
program?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
donahue.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
should
a
challenge
to
that
have
been
brought
in
the
d.c.
circuit
at
that
time,
or
would
you
have
argued
that's
too
late?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
presumably
duke
could
say,
we
looked
at
the
reich
memorandum
and
we
were
following
that
and
all
of
a
sudden
this
new
1988
thing
came
up
and
they
are
surprised
by
that.
now
you're
saying
it's
already
too
late
because
somebody
else
challenged
it
in
1980?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
be
fair
to
them,
that
very
same
argument
was
more
a
product
of
the
fourth
circuit
than
of
duke.
they
had
a
somewhat
different
approach
before
the
fourth
circuit
and
then
the
fourth
circuit
came
up
with
this
insistence
on
the
parallel
construction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
midst
of
the
enforcement
action
that's
being
brought
against
them
by
epa?
what's
supposed
to
happen
in
the
enforcement
action,
if
that's
the
vehicle
through
which
epa
is
implementing
its
new
interpretation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
a
pause,
under
your
view
or
the
fourth
circuit's
view?
if
you
read
judge
tatel's
opinion
in
new
york
versus
epa,
he
suggests...
suggests,
he
says
that
epa
adopted
different
interpretations
of
modification
from
the
outset.
and
so
if
what
you
are
saying
couldn't
have
been
challenged,
was
the
fourth
circuit's
view,
that
may
not
be
accurate.
but
if
you
are
saying
what
couldn't
have
been
anticipated
was
the
argument
you
actually
made
to
the
fourth
circuit,
that
might
be
a
different
story.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
answer
is
you
are
not
relying
simply
on
the
general
principle.
it
is
not
just
that
they
used
the
word
modification
in
one
place
and
the
word
modification
in
the
other.
it's
that
in
the
latter
place,
they
said
modification
as
defined
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
explain
to
me
again
why
this
isn't
a
307(b)
problem?
you
said
this
is
an
action
by
the
administrator?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can't
challenge
in
the
d.c.
circuit
the
administrator's
interpretation
that
led
to
the
enforcement
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
donahue,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
major...
when
you
say
the
statutory
term,
you
mean
"modification"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
why
weren't
those
proposed
regulations
saying
just
that,
adopted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
tough
sell,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
idea
is
you
propose
regulations
saying
major
modification
means
modification.
those
regulations
are
not
adopted,
and
then
the
industry
is
supposed
to
be
on
notice
that
that's
still
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
donahue.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
today
in
case
05-848,
environmental
defense
versus
duke
energy
he
has
asked
me
to
read
the
announcement
for
him.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
the
1970s
congress
added
two
air
pollution
controls
schemes
to
the
clean
air
act.
new
source
performance
standards
(nsps)
and
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
(psd)
each
statutory
scheme
covers
modified
as
well
as
new
stationary
sources
of
air
pollution.
the
nsps
provisions
go
on
to
define
what
modification
means
but
the
psd
provisions
which
were
enacted
seven
years
later
simply
used
that
word
“as
defined
in”
nsps.
over
the
years
the
environmental
protection
agency
promulgated
regulations
to
implement
the
two
programs.
those
regulations
implemented
the
common
statutory
definition
of
modification,
one
way
for
nsps
and
another
way
for
psd.
now
this
case
arises
from
an
enforcement
action
brought
by
the
federal
government
against
respondent
duke
energy
corporation.
duke
runs
coal
fired
electric
generating
plants
in
north
and
south
carolina
and
the
government
alleged
the
boilers
in
those
plants
had
been
modified
without
a
psd
permit.
in
response
duke
argued
that
various
replacements
and
redesigns
in
its
plants
were
not
modifications
for
psd
purposes
because
they
did
not
qualify
as
modifications
under
the
nsps
regulations.
now,
with
nsps
there
could
not
be
a
modification
requirement
of
permit
unless
the
modification
increases
the
hourly
rate
at
which
pollution
could
be
emitted.
the
government
responded
that
psd
need
not
be
identical
to
nsps
and
that
psd
required
duke
to
obtain
a
permit
whenever
a
physical
change
enables
a
plant
to
operate
longer
hours
and
produce
more
pollutants.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
duke,
it
reasoned
that
nsps
regulations
require
an
increase
in
the
hourly
emission
rate
before
a
modification
can
occur
and
that
the
common
statutory
definition
of
modification
requires
epa
to
implement
that
term
in
the
same
way
under
both
the
nsps
and
psd
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
then
read
the
psd
regulations
as
providing
what
the
nsps
regulations
provided.
in
the
supplemental
appellate
brief
the
government
argued
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
effectively
invalidating
the
psd
regulations
as
written
a
form
of
judicial
review
that
must
generally
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
after
the
regulations
are
promulgated
prepares
noting
that
the
psd
regulations
at
issue
here
were
promulgated
by
epa
in
1980,
a
quarter
century
before
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
here
however
did
not
believe
that
the
validity
of
the
psd
regulations
was
at
issue.
it
said
it
was
simply
giving
those
regulations
a
permissible
construction
to
align
them
with
the
nsps
counterpart.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
vacate
and
remand.
as
an
initial
matter
we
do
not
view
the
common
definition
of
modification
in
statutory
nsps
and
psd
provisions
as
a
rigid
mandate
that
epa
give
that
term
an
identical
regulatory
clause
under
both
schemes
nor
do
we
think
that
the
text
of
the
1980
psd
regulations
can
be
construed
inline
with
the
nsps
counterparts.
the
psd
regulations
plainly
do
not
require
an
increase
in
the
hourly
rate
of
emissions
before
a
modification
can
occur.
for
example
the
physical
change
that
increases
the
plant’s
annual
emissions
by
permitting
the
plant
to
operate
and
thus
to
emit
over
longer
daily
hours
can
count
as
a
modification
too.
by
giving
the
psd
regulations
an
impermissible
construction
the
court
of
appeals
implicitly
invalidated
them
and
this,
the
court
could
not
do
without
first
complying
with
the
limitations
that
the
clean
air
act
places
on
judicial
review
for
validity
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
believe
that
invalidated
the
psd
regulations
it
did
not
consider
the
applicability
or
effective
of
those
statutory
limitations
and
we
have
no
occasion
at
this
point
to
consider
this
issue
ourselves
nor
do
we
consider
duke’s
claim
that
epa’s
position
in
this
enforcement
proceedings
is
inconsistent
with
the
agency’s
prior
practice.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
tackles
that
argument
and
if
it
is
not
procedural
foreclosed
duke
may
press
it
on
remand.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
