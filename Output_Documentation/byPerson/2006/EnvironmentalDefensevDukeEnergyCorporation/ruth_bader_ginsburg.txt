mr.
donahue,
were
there
earlier
enforcement
actions
in
which
epa
was
taking
the
position
that
it
took
in
this
action
against
duke?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
were
they,
in
fact,
enforcing
that
standard?
so
that...
you
said
that
duke
could
have
asked
for
a
non-applicability
ruling,
but
at
the
time
duke
started
up
its--
justice

bader
ginsburg
and
the
ambiguity
is
the
word
"increase",
which
could
mean
different
things?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
as
i
understand
it
now
has
a
proposed
regulation
that
would
align
the
standards
with
the
two
programs.
it
would
bring
the
nonproliferation...
it
would
bring
the
standard
for
the
nonproliferation
program
in
line
with
the
new
source
performance
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
since
the
government
is
now
taking
the
position
that
another
duke
could
do
just
what
was
done
here
and
there's
an
enforcement
action
pending,
would
you,
if
you
prevailed
in
that
enforcement
action,
nonetheless
enforce,
though
it's
those
against
the
current
government
policy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
bring
it
up
by
a
declaration
of
non-applicability?
could
the
new
company...
how
would
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
were
some
companies
asking
for
declarations
of
nonapplicability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
donahue
said
that
there
were
nonapplicability
applications
after
those
early
ones
that
came
out
the
other
way.
so
there
were
companies--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--who
asked
for
a
declaration
of
nonapplication
and
then
epa
took
the
position
that
it
is
currently
taking.
