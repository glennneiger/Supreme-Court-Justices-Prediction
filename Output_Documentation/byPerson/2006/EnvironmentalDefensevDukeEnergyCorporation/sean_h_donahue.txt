mr.
sean
h.
donahue
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
clean
air
act
requires
that
the
owner
of
a
major
emitting
facility
obtain
a
prevention
of
significant
deterioration
permit
before
engaging
in
a
modification,
which
is
defined
to
include
any
physical
change
that
increases
the
amount
of
any
pollutant
emitted
by
such
source.
since
1980,
epa's
psd
regulations
have
measured
such
increases
in
terms
of
actual
emissions
in
tons
per
year.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
text
of
the
regulations
refers
pervasively,
and
i'm
referring
to
the
definition
of
major
modification
which
is
in
40
cfr
51.166(b)(2)
and
subsequent
paragraphs
of
that
regulation,
refers
pervasively
to
actual
emissions
and
measures
emissions
exclusively
in
tons
per
year.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
yes,
justice
scalia.
respondent
has
relied
heavily
on
two
early
applicability
determinations.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
well,
justice
scalia,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
director
reich
does
not
adopt
duke's
theory,
in
fact
contradicts
it.
he
doesn't
say
that
a
new
source
performance
standard
modification
must
precede
a
psd
major
modification.
instead,
in
both
he
relies
on
the
express
exclusion
in
the
psd
regulations
for
increases
in
hours
of
operation
and
the
production
rate,
and
as
epa
explained
in
its
contemporaneous
preamble,
that
provision
by
its
terms
is
an
exception
from
the
definition
of
physical
change.
it
is
not
a
provision
that
says...
increase
is
attributable
to
a
physical
change,
to
increased
hours
that
are
enabled
by
physical
change,
are
not
considered.
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
actually
contradicts
this
reading.
these
determinations
themselves
are
quite
ambiguous,
and
of
course
they
are
two
of
dozens
of
such
determinations.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
those
opinions
were
out
there
but
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
and
the
preamble
which
explain
that
the
increased
hours
exclusion
was
simply
to
allow
companies
to
respond
to
demand
and
to
link
the
coverage
of
psd
to
construction
activity.
what
we
have
here
is
a
physical
change
in
the
plants,
massive
renovations
of
these
elaborate
networks
of
pipes
and
tubes
that
compose
a
central
component.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
well,
justice
scalia,
these
regulations
were
challenged
early
on
and
there
was
a...
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
was
a
settlement
agreement
in
1982
to
which
duke
was,
in
fact,
a
party,
that
proposed
to
add
the
hourly
rate
test
that
is
completely
absent
from
these
regulations.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
they
did
in
fact
precisely
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
was
resolved
in
the
new
york
proceeding
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
duke
didn't
challenge
the
very
prominent
aspect
of
the
1980
regulations,
which
was
to
move
away
from
the
potential
emissions
test
of
prior--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--well,
the
regulations
were
clear
on
their
face.
i
mean,
to
determine
the
effect
of
307--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--they're
clear
in
this
respect,
they
did
not
include
an
hourly
rate
test.
as
judge
posner
in
the
cinergy
opinion
this
summer
said,
the
argument
that
the
statute
mandates
an
hourly
rate
test
is
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
these
1980
regulations
because
they
don't
say
it,
they
don't
provide
for
it,
and
they
are
very
specific
and
detailed,
and
instead
turn
on
actual
annual
emissions.
and
the
entire
rationale
epa
offered
was
linked
to
that
effort
to
capture
real
world
changes
in
emissions.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
right.
he
misapplied,
he
didn't
adopt
this
theory,
the
theory
that
an
nsps
modification
precedes
at
all;
in
fact,
he
contradicted
it.
he
misapplied
in
quite
sort
of
anomalous
circumstances
the
increased
hours--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--we
think
that
this
court
can
resolve,
can
interpret,
can
address
the
reasonableness
of
epa's
construction
of
the
increased
hours
exclusion.
what
it
can't
do
is
certainly
what
the
fourth
circuit
did,
which
is
to
say
that
the
psd
regulations
must
be
the
same.
they
are
obviously
not
the
same.
they
are
different
in
multiple
respects.
and
certainly
that
challenge
could
have
been
raised,
and
certainly
that
challenge
was
barred,
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
called
the
regulations
irrelevant,
the
texts
and
interpretations
of
the
regulations.
that's
exactly
what
a
court
is
supposed
to
be
doing.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
well,
that...
they're
not
ambiguous
as
to
whether
they're
identical,
and
to
hold
that
they
have
to
be
is
certainly
an
invalidation.
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
of
course,
held
that
the
statute
doesn't
require
identity
as
between
the
two
sets
of
regulations.
and
we're
not
here
on
certiorari
from
the
new
york
decision,
we're
here
on
an
enforcement
action
in
which
a
court
leapt
over
the
express
limitations
imposed
on
it,
declared
the
language
of
the
regulations
irrelevant,
and
indeed
misapplied
them
rather
dramatically.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
right.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
no.
i
have
no
problem
with
any
of
that.
if
the
regulations
are
ambiguous,
take
into
account
the
statutory
text,
structure,
policies.
what
the
court
below
did,
of
course,
was
say
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
regulations
say,
these
have
to
be
the
same.
it
forgot
that
in
fact,
these
regulations
were
very
different.
the
d.c.
circuit
said
there's
no
statutory
mandate
of
identity
and
that
the...
and,
of
course,
respondent
was
there
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
was
permitted
to
assert
a
challenge
to
this
divergence,
as
the
court
called
it,
between
nsps
regulations
and
psd.
and
the
court
said--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--accepting
that
premise,
they
could
have
sought
an
applicability
determination.
duke
knew
very
well
what
epa's
interpretation
was
because
of
the
wepco
decision.
epa
had
been...
and
subsequent
actions.
in
fact,
duke's
attorneys
were
vociferously
charging
that
epa
changed
the
rules
and
was
acting
ultra
vires.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
well,
in
the
wepco
decision...
i
mean,
epa
has
always
taken
the
position
that
actual
annual
emissions
is
the
standard
under
the
1980
rules.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
certainly.
i
mean,
wepco
was
an
applicability
determination.
that
was
in
1989-90.
puerto
rican
cement
was
an
applicability
determination.
duke
instead,
knowing
that
epa
believed
that
increased
utilization
that
is
caused
by
physical
change
has
to
be
considered
under
this,
as
is
prescribed
in
these
very
detailed
regulations,
duke
decided
not
to
do
that,
to
go
forward,
and
it
didn't,
in
fact,
come
to
the
state
or
to
epa.
of
course,
the
increased
hours...
i
understand
the
court's
concern
about
the
reich
memos.
but
epa's
construction
of
the
increased
hours
exception
is
completely
correct
under
the
plain
language
of
the
regulations.
and
in
wepco
the
court
upheld.
so
that
there
was
no
question
that
not
only
was
it
consistent
with
the
plain
language,
but
whatever
reich
had
said,
the
express
language
of
the
regulations
was
as
far
as
the
exception
went.
there
was
no
further
confusion,
if
those
early
memos
caused
confusion.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
just
can't
read
the
1980
regulations
to
achieve
the
result
duke
is
seeking
here.
there
is
no
hourly
rate
in
there,
and
it's
important
to
note
that
these
provisions
that
they
now
state
misled
them
into
their
non-challenge,
they
didn't
even
cite
to
the
fourth
circuit
or
the
district
court,
and
on
their
face,
they're
not...
it's
not
plausible
that
these
provisions,
which
are
totally
nonspecific,
were
intended
to
vary
the
very
detailed
and
specific
instructions
on
how
to
measure
an
emissions
increase
laid
out.
and
the
preamble--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--no,
i
don't
give
them
that.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
because
it
says
rate,
and
the
1980
psc
regulations
say
that
the
relevant
rate
is
tons
per
year.
they
use
the
word
"rate"
pervasively.
i
would
also
say
the
preamble
to
the
rule
makes
conclusively
clear
that
epa's
definition
of
the
statutory
term.
this
idea
that
epa,
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
not
only--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--correct.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
it's
absolutely
clear.
epa
has
never
said
otherwise.
and
of
course
the
idea
that
an
nsps
modification
is
required
first,
it
would
have
been
a
big
deal.
there
is
no
sign
of
it,
and
in
fact
there
are
specific
examples.
the
example
cited
at
page
23
of
the
government's
opening
brief
in
the
preamble
is
a
psd
major
modification
that
would
not
be
an
nsps--
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
--i
think
that
there's
no
other
reading
of
what
epa
meant
from
the
regulations.
no
one
was
confused
by
this,
chief
justice
roberts.
no
one
was
confused.
this
argument,
it's
a
new
argument
in
this
court
about
how
to
read
the
rules,
the
30...
52.01(d),
51.100,
and
51.166(b)(8),
all
uncited
below.
it's
really
not
plausible.
the
court
would
have
to
abandon
a
lot
of
very
basic
principles
of
how
to
interpret
legal
texts
to
read
the
rules
this
way,
and
i
think
judge
poisner
was
right
on
that.
he
was
right
to
say
this
is
the
natural
reading
of
the
rules.
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
51.166(b)(21)
and
(b)(23).
mr.
sean
h.
donahue
it's
the
only...
it's
tons
per
year
consistently.
the
other
thing
i
would
point
out,
as
the
court
is
aware,
is
that
307(b)
applies
it
bars
courts
in
enforcement
actions,
which
includes
this
court.
this
case
is
not
up
on
cert
from
the
d.c.
circuit
in
new
york.
thank
you
very
much.
