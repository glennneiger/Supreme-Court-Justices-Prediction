but
if
they're
flatly
contradictory,
doesn't
your
argument
have
to
be
that
109(a)
has
lesser
status?
that's
what
it
boils
down
to,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
what
you
think
the
department
of
labor
was
doing
when
it
promulgated
109(a).
it
was
thinking
in
effect
the
following:
we
have
the
power
to
issue
a
regulation
here
that
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
and
we're
going
to
go
through
the
procedure
that
would
be
necessary
to
issue
such
a
regulation.
but
we're
not
invoking
that
power
here
because
we
want
this
interpretation
which
we
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
not
to
be
followed...
not
to
get
as
much
deference
from
the
courts
as
it
would
if
we
were
invoking
our
power.
does
that
make
any
sense?
that
an
agency
would
proceed
in
that
way?
