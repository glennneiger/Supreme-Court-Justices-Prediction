was
that
later?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
much
later?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
thought
that
the
provision
that
was...
what
is
the
number...
where
they
say
552.109;
that
didn't
appear
anywhere
until
many
years
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
read--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
read
3
and
3
says
what
you
said
it
says.
all
right.
how
much
later
did
they
promulgate
109?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
thought.
so
the
same
day
they
say,
3,
you
have
to
have
these
domestic
workers
employed
by
the
old
lady
who's
sick,
and
then
in
109
they
say
you
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
why
is
that
a
conflict?
let's
imagine...
it
sounds
like
a
conflict.
but
it's
easy
for
me
to
imagine
a
regulation
that
says
birds
for
purposes
of
this
are
animals
that
fly,
and
then
15
pages
later
it
says,
but
by
the
way,
penguins
don't
and
they're
still
covered.
i
mean,
why
is
that
a
conflict?
there
are
lots
of
specific
situations.
if
i
read
that,
i
would
have
thought,
well,
okay,
they
have
an
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
congress
intend
to
cover,
which
i
guess
is
a
growing
situation,
that
there
is
an
old
woman
or
man
and
they're
very
sick
and
they
live
in
their
house,
there's
only
one
way
to
keep
them
from
having
to
go
to
an
institution.
their
children
hire
a
companion
to
look
after
them.
now,
that's
a
third
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
"about,
in
or
about
a
private
home
of
the
person
by
whom
he
is
employed.
"
i
live
in
san
francisco.
my
mother
lives
in
massachusetts.
now,
if
i
hire
a
companion
to
live
in
massachusetts,
that
companion
does
not
work
about
a
private
home
of
the
person,
me,
by
whom
she
is
employed.
so
if
we're
being
literal
and
if
you
win
this
case,
i
don't
see
how...
and
i'm
worried
about
this,
obviously...
however...
and
i
think
it's
probably
very
common,
that
all
over
the
country
it's
the
family,
the
children,
the
grandchildren,
an
aunt,
an
uncle,
maybe
a
good
friend,
maybe
they're
not
even
related,
who
is
paying
for
a
companion
for
an
old,
sick
person
so
they
don't
have
to
be
brought
to
an
institution.
and
if
you
win
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
suddenly
there
will
be
millions
of
people
who
will
be
unable
to
do
it
and,
hence,
millions
of
sick
people
who
will
move
to
institutions.
now,
if
i
were
to
say
that
that
isn't
totally
a
legal
point,
it
is
of
course
a
legal
point
because
it's
a
question
of
what
people
intended,
but
a
worrisome
point,
i
would
be
telling
the
truth.
it
is
a
very
worrisome
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
perhaps
there
are
people,
lawyers
in
the
government,
who
try
to
see
through
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
are
many...
maybe
justice
scalia
has
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
we're
into
that,
we're
into
this
fascinating
subject,
i
thought
that
possibly
they
had...
they
promulgated
the
whole
thing
pursuant
to
the
rulemaking
power
under
that
particular
statute,
because
that's
what
it
says
in
552.2.
it
says
552.
and
both
regs
we
are
talking
about
are
in
the
part.
and
b
says
interpretations,
but
they
don't
mean
interpretive
rules,
because
when
you
look
at
those
interpretations,
they
have
a
whole
lot
of
numbers
in
them,
and
divide
by
32.
nobody
thinks
that
congress
meant
in
this
statute
divide
by
32,
as
opposed
by
divide
by
33.
so
as
i
read
that,
i
thought
the
whole
thing
is
promulgated
pursuant
to
their
rulemaking
authority;
part
a
has
more
general
things.
part
b
has
more
specific
things.
where
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
of
them.
all
of
them
is
what
it
says
unless
i
missed
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
got
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
second
case
long
island
care
versus
coke
that
has
to
do
with
the
federal
labor
standards
act.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
has
to
do
with
maximum
hours
and
minimum
wages
and
in
1974
congress
amended
the
act
so
the
domestic
workers
fell
within
the
act.
but
at
that
time,
it
made
an
exception
for
domestic
sub-workers
who
provide
companionship
services
for
individuals
who
because
of
age
or
infirmity
are
unable
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
then
in
the
statute
there
is
a
parenthetical
and
it
says,
“as
such
terms
are
defined
and
delimited
by
secretary
of
labor.”
now
within
a
year
i
think
in
1975,
the
secretary
promulgated
some
regulations
and
they
said
among
lots
of
other
things
that
“these
companionship
workers
who
are
looking
after
old
people
or
sick
people
and
who
are
not
covered
by
the
minimum
wage
laws
is
their
exempt”
they
include
not
only
those
who
are
employed
by
the
old
sick
person
but
also
those
who
are
employed
by
agencies
or
third
parties
that’s
called
the
“third
party
regulation”
and
more
recently
that
regulation
has
turned
out
to
be
very
controversial
and
the
department
from
time
to
time
has
considered
changing
it
or
withdrawing
it
but
it
never
has.
now,
in
this
case
the
domestic
companionship
worker
who
was
paid
by
a
third
party,
claims
that
the
regulation
which
in
fact
exempts
her
from
the
minimum
wage
law
is
unlawful.
now
she
doesn’t
have
that
easier
job
with
her
case
because
the
statute
says,
that
the
“secretary
of
labor
and
delimit
the
terms
of
the
exception.”
in
other
parts
it
gives
the
secretary
lots
of
regulation
righting
authority.
but
she
makes
them
pretty
good
arguments,
there
are
four
basic
arguments.
she
says,
“the
regulation
falls
outside
the
scope
of
the
acts
delegation.”
she
says,
“it
conflicts
with
a
different
regulation
it
can’t
prompt
at
other
regulation.”
she
says,
“this
is
listed
in
a
section
called
interpretations
so
it
must
be
an
interpretive
regulation
which
we
shouldn’t
pay
that
much
attention
to”
and
she
says,
“the
department
failed
to
follow
proper
procedures
when
it
promulgated
the
regulation
30
years
ago.”
now
the
second
circuit
accepted
some
of
these
arguments
but
we,
while
we
think
they
are
good
arguments
they
are
not
quite
good
enough
and
we
find
them
not
convincing,
and
we
setout
our
reasons
in
our
opinion.
now
since
those
reasons
are
quite
technical
in
nature
i
shall
spare
you
a
recitation
of
them
and
i
will
leave
those
with
a
keen
interest
in
administrative
law
and
labor
law
to
read
the
opinion.
so,
we
reverse
the
second
circuit
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
