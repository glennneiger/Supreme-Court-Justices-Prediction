mr.
farr,
would
you
agree
that
the
position
expressed
in
the
notice
itself
would
have...
in
the
original
notice
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
statutory
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
there
would
be
a
basis
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
third-party
employers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salmons,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
importance
of
the
whole
litigation.
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
there's
a
provision
in
the
law
that
protects
the
defendants
from
damages
liability
if
they
relied
in
good
faith
on
the
regulation,
so
that
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
whether
the
regulation
would
apply
in
the
future
rather
than
there
being
a
damage
issue
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
clearly
apply
to
this
case,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
your
view
we're
really
faced
with
a
question
of
whether
the
regulation
should
be
given
prospective
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
whether
the
government's
position
should
be
given
prospective
effect
because
the
past
liability
doesn't...
the
damage
liability
just
doesn't
exist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
it's
permissible
to
change
the
rules
because
the
industry
has
changed.
is
it
not
possible
that
the
industry
changed
at
about
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted?
that
the
prevalence
of
third-party
employers
is
something
that
really
developed
later?
