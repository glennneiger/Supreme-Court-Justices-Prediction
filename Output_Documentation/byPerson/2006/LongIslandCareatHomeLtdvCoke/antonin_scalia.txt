justice
antonin
scalia
what's
a
footman?
i
don't
even
know
what
a
footman
is.
[laughter]
what
is
a
footman?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
farr,
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
your
argument
with
regard
to
552.101(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
page
77a
as
you
said.
but
what
is
your
argument
there?
i
mean,
that
seems
to,
that
seems
to
reinforce
the
provision
that
you
say
we
should
ignore
or
at
least
should
accept
the
secretary's
reinterpretation
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
i
see.
is
that
clear
in
the...
in
the
specific
senate
report
that
is
referred
to
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
this,
the
one
that's
cited
in
the
regulation
itself.
because
i...
otherwise,
i
don't,
i
ignore
those
things.
that's
cited
in
the
regulation.
does
that
report
say
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
does
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
set
forth
the
agency's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
it
did.
they're
just
floating
an
idea.
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--run
it
up
the
flagpole,
see
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
imagination
for
justice
breyer
to
give
the
money
to
his
mother,
who
could
then
hire.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
clever
lawyer
would
think
of
that,
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
could
have
said
a
lot
of
things.
but
i
find
it...
you're
hanging
your
case
upon
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
difference
between
domestic
service
employment
and
employed
in
domestic
service
employment.
wow.
you
know,
i
just
don't
see
how
there's
any
difference
in
those
two
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
we
have
to
find
some
difference
no
matter
how
imaginative
the
difference
might
be.
if
there
were
a
difference,
i'm
not
sure
it's
the
difference
that
you're
arguing
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
what
your
proposal
is
with
regard
to
the
contradictory
regulations,
552.3
and
552.
--what
is
it,
109?
i
think
they
are
contradictory.
now,
the
agency
has
come
up
with
a
solution.
we
will
interpret
the
former
quite
unrealistically
to
mean
something
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
say
but...
you
know...
close
enough
for
government
work.
what
is
your
solution
for
solving
the
inconsistency?
are
both
of
the
regulations
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
other
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
employed
and
domestic
employment
versus--
justice
antonin
scalia
--domestic
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
getting
into
arguments
now
that
are
not
about
the
regulation
but
they're
about
the
statute.
i'm
assuming
that
we
have
regulations
that
are
entitled
to
deference.
and
you
have
two
regulations
that
are
conflicting.
now,
how
do
you
decide
which
one
prevails?
counsel
for
the
other
side
says
the
specific
governs
the
general,
certainly
an
ancient
prescription.
counsel
also
says
that
this
is
an
agency
regulation.
the
agency
is
given
great
deference
in
the
interpretation
of
it
own
regulations.
and
even
if
the
agency
had
said
well,
you
know,
they
do
conflict,
we
admit
it,
they
totally
conflict,
we
won't
even
try
to
reinterpret
552.3,
we
think
that's
the
one
that's
wrong,
why
wouldn't
we
accept
their
statement
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
statutory.
i
just
want
to
focus
on
the
regulation
arguments,
not
the
statutory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
aren't
unambiguous.
they
contradict
each
other.
the
agency
has
to
do
something
about
it,
and
here
the
agency
made
a
choice.
even
if
i
assume
the
choice
was,
we're
going
to
disregard
552.3,
we're
going
to
strike
out
those
words,
they
were
the
mistake.
one
or
the
other
had
to
be
the
mistake.
we
decided
it
was
this
one.
why
shouldn't
we
take
their
word
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
interpretive
regulations
are
in
other
areas
wholly
valid
before
the
courts
and
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
at
least
if
they're
adopted
by
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
you
know,
we
have
nothing,
what
should
i
say,
subordinate
about
interpretive
regulations.
in
fact,
probably
most
of
the
significant
regulations
of
the
most
important
agencies
are
interpretive
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
you
say
it
creates
two
types,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
it
intended
one
type
of
authority
to
be
entitled
to
less
respect
from
the
courts
than
the
other.
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
proposition
that
an
interpretive
regulation
is
somehow
not
a
full-fledged
binding
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
different
but
not
necessarily
of
different...
entitled
to
different
respect
from
the
courts.
a
defined...
what
is
it,
define
and
delimit?
these
are
regulations
that
don't
even
purport
to
be
an
interpretation
of
any
language
in
the
statute,
but
the
use
of
authority
given
to
the
agency
to
cut
out
certain
areas,
to
say
the...
this
rule
won't
apply
to
companies
over
this...
that
can't
possibly
be
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
so
congress
says
we're
going
to
give
the
agency
that
authority.
in
addition,
of
course,
we're
going
to
give
this
agency
the
authority
that
every
other
agency
has,
which
is
to
interpret...
interpret
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
skidmore
was
before
a
rather
significant
case
called
chevron.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
we're
going
to
divide
all
administrative
law
now
into
those...
those
regulations...
those
provisions
that
were
adopted
by
congress
pre-chevron
and
those
adopted
by
congress
post-chevron,
and
for
the
ones
adopted
pre-chevron
we're
going
to
treat
regulation
as
essentially
suggestions
by
the
agency
which
we
give
skidmore
deference
to,
and
the
ones
after
chevron,
we're
going
to
treat
differently.
do
you
have
any
case
of
ours
that
suggests
something
like
that,
which
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
manner
of
proceeding?
