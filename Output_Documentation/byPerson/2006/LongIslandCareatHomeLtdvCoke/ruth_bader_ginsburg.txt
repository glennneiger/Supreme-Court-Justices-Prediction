i
thought
the
words
were
home
of
the
person
who
employs,
not
who
receives
the
services
but
who
employs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by...
reading
out
the
words
"of
the
person
who
employs"
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
department
of
labor's
first
take
on
this
was
that
the
exemption
did
not
apply
to
third-party
employers.
that
was
the
original
department
of
labor
position,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
referring
to
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
in
which
you
place
great
stock.
i
thought
the
original
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
said
the
exemption
does
not
apply
to
third-party
employers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
there
was
no
further
discussion
of
it
after...
after
it
sent
out
the
notice
of
proposed
ruling
that
said
third
party
employees
will
not
be
exempt,
and
then
it
said
they
will
be
exempt,
did
it
give
reasons
for
the
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
would
be
the
ones
that
qualified
as...
what
is
the
phrase,
enterprises
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
they
covered
before,
before
there
was
any
provision
that
dealt
with
household
workers?
if
state
and
localities
were
considered
enterprises
engaged
in
commerce,
then
presumably
they
were...
they
had
no
exemption
before,
their
companion
care
people,
just
as
household
workers,
would
be
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
statute
treats
together
babysitters
and
elder
care
people,
but
i
take
it
the
babysitters
if
they
were
working
for
an
agency
rather
than
for
the
householders,
there
wouldn't
be
any
exemption?
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
odd
that
this...
the
basic
thing
about
the
'74
legislation,
it
was
going
to
add
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
people
who
were
not
covered
before.
so
it
added
household
workers.
and
yet
you
say
that,
while
congress
had
its
mind
trained
on
adding
people,
it
also
subtracted
people
who
were
covered
before,
took
them
out,
removed
them
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.

mr.

justice
ruth
bader

--mr....
mr.
becker,
if
there
is
room
for
the
agency
to
read
this
statute
either
way,
one
way
that
the
third
party
employee
would
come
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
other
that
they
would
not,
would
be
treated
the
same
way
as
the
person
employed
by
the
elderly
person
himself
or
herself,
but
if
the
concern
of
congress
in
making
this
exemption
was
for
the
householder
with
limited
funds,
if
the
agency
is
subject
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
it's
going
to
end
up
being
the
householder
paying
for
it
anyway.
so
why
isn't
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant
by
the
exemption
that
the
exemption
would
apply
across
the
board,
so
that
all
workers
in
this
category
would
be
exempt?
