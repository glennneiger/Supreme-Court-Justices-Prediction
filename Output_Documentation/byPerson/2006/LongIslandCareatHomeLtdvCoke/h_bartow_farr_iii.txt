mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
congress
made
one
thing
very
clear,
that
it
wanted
the
department
of
labor
to
define
the
boundaries
and
fill
in
the
details
of
the
companionship
services
exemption.
and
i
think
that
has
two
important
implications
for
this
case.
first
of
all,
when
the
department
has
filled
in
the
details,
after
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
its
regulations
should
receive
chevron
deference
as
long
as
they
are
permissible
implementation
of
the
statute.
second,
and
particularly
specific
to
this
case,
if
there
are
ambiguities
in
the
regulations,
or
as
we
have
here,
an
apparent
facial
inconsistency,
the
court
should
accept
the
secretary's
resolution
of
that
ambiguity
provided
that
it
is
a
reasonable
one.
and
here
we
submit
it's
not
only
a
reasonable
one,
it
is
by
far
the
most
sensible
one.
now
i'd
actually
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
second
issue
first,
because
i
think
that's
the
source
of
a
lot
of
the
concern
in
this
case.
plainly
the
two
regulations,
section
10...
552.109(a),
which
is
the
regulation
directly
at
issue
before
this
court,
and
552.3,
which
is
the
regulation
relied
on
heavily
by
the
second
circuit
to
strike
down
the
present
regulation,
have
some
inconsistency
between
them.
but
it
is
also
plain
that
the
department
could
not
have
intended
to
say
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
the
only
employers
entitled
use
the
exemption
were
homeowners
and
then
say
in
another
section
promulgated
at
the
same
time
that
also
third-party
employers
are
entitled
to
the
exemption.
so
the
question
is,
how
does
one
resolve
this
apparent
inconsistency?
and
the
secretary
says,
well,
the
only
regulation
that
we
promulgated
that,
in
fact,
deals
specifically
with
the
issue
of
third-party
employment
is
552.109(a),
which
is
in
fact
headed
third-party
employment.
and
that
section
552.3,
while
containing
some
language
that
might
be
read
to
address
that
issue,
in
fact
deals
with
several
other
topics.
specifically
it
deals
with
the
topic
of
what
kinds
of
jobs
are
involved
in
domestic
service,
maids,
chauffeurs,
footmen,
et
cetera;
where
those
have
to
be
performed,
in
a
private
home;
and
in
fact,
somewhat
more
than
that,
in
the
private
home
of
the
person
receiving
the
services.
so
it's
not
enough,
for
example,
for
somebody
to
conduct
a
service
like
laundry
or
baby
sitting
in
his
or
her
own
house,
it
has
to
be
in
the
house
of
the
person
receiving
the
services.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
literal
language
is
not
specifically
what
i
was
saying.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
secretary's
attempt
to
resolve
what
is
an
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
literal
language
in
552.3
and
the
literal
language
of
section
552.109(a).
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
essentially
reading
them
to
say
they,
they
were
not
intended
to
address
directly
the
subject
of
third
party
employment
which
is
the
subject
addressed
in
109(a).
and
i
think
if
one
is...
even
leaving
aside
the
question
of
deference
to
the
secretary
for
a
moment,
justice
ginsburg,
if
one
is
simply
talking
about
making
a
fair
resolution
of
these
conflicting
provisions
from
the
ground
up,
it
seems
to
me
the
first
thing
that
one
would
do
is
apply
the
canon
that
the
specific
provision
controls
the
general.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
two
provisions,
section
109(a)
is
a
provision
that
deals
with
one
thing
and
one
thing
only:
that
is
third
party
employment.
and
it
says
explicitly
and
straight
out
that
persons
who
are
employed
by
third-party
employers
are...
or
third-party
employers
who
employ
persons
performing
domestic
services
are
entitled
to
the
exemption.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
would
be
true.
now
that
would
be
inapplicable--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
that
may
be
beyond
my
expertise,
justice
scalia.
the...
of
course
that
doesn't
address
anything
beyond
companionship
services,
of
course,
because
there
is
not
an
exemption
beyond
that.
and
that's
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
552.3.
in
addition
to
generally
dealing
with
this
question
of
what
kind
of
jobs
are
domestic
service,
it
is,
in
fact,
going
well
beyond
anything
that
is
necessary
to
a
discussion
of
the
exemption
for
companionship
services,
because
jobs
like
chauffeurs,
and
maids,
and
all
of
that
are
not
subject
to
the
exemption.
so
it
really
looking
at
what
552.3
is
doing
despite
the
couple
of
words
that...
at
the
beginning
of
it,
is
giving
a
general
definition
of
what
constitutes
domestic
employment,
what
constitutes
domestic
services
for
purposes
not
only
of
the
exemption
but,
in
fact,
really
for
the
purposes
of
coverage
as
well.
and
the
department
has
taken
that
position.
it
says
this
is,
in
fact,
the
only
definition
of
domestic
service
that
we
have
in
the
regulations,
and
it
is
not
just
intended
to
be
limited
to
the
particular
situation
of
the
exemption.
it
applies
more
broadly
than
that
to
coverage
as
well.
so
i
think
in
all
those
senses,
justice
kennedy,
109
is
a
very
specific
provision,
552.3
deals
with
a
number
of
other
subjects.
now,
one
other
thing
on
the
statutory
interpretation
part
is
that
the
reading
of
552.3
that
respondent
offers
also
leads
to
the
problem
that
essentially
sets
up
a
tension
with
another
one
of
the
regulations
which
is
552.101(a).
552.101(a)
which
i'm
sorry...
i
don't
have
the
right
page
number
here...
it
is
on
page
77a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
has,
carries
over
the
language
from
552.3
about
in
the
home
of
the
employer
that
justice
ginsburg
referred
to.
but
then
it
also
says
that
this
includes
people
who
are
commonly
referred
to
as
private
household
workers.
and
the
one
thing
we
know
from
the
department
of
labor
submissions
to
congress
in
1974
and
also
from
what
the
department
has
said
before
this
court
is
that
that
term
at
the
time
was
defined
by
the
department
and
known
by
congress
to
constitute
more
than
just
employees
employed
by
the
homeowner.
there
was
a
special
second
category
for
people
who
worked
in
the
home
of
the
homeowner
at
the
homeowner's
request
but
were
employed
by
a
third
party
agency.
now
somewhere
underlying
all
of
this
question,
i
think,
is
statutory
interpretation
and
indeed
all
of
respondent's
arguments
against
deference
to
the
department
is
a
basic
underlying
premise,
which
is
that
congress
really
would
not
have
wanted,
even
if
it
didn't
say
so,
for
the
exemption
to
apply
to
employees
who
work
for
third
parties.
and
i
would
just
like
to
suggest
that
there
really
is
no
basis
for
thinking
that
congress
would
have
wanted
that.
first
of
all,
third
party
employers
such
as
private
agencies
provide
services
for
the
particular
group
of
people
which
congress
was
trying
to
assist
with
this
exemption.
people
who
by
reason
of
age
or
disability
are
unable
to
care
for
themselves.
agencies
acting
as
the
employers
specifically
can
do
the
hiring,
they
can
do
the
vetting
and
the
screening,
the
background
screening
for
employees.
they
can
provide
necessary
paperwork,
filing
social
security
documents
and
things
like
that.
so,
in
fact,
for
congress
to
have
some
sort
of
bias
against
covered
enterprises
seems
a
little
bit
unusual.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
uh-huh.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well
perhaps,
perhaps
i
wasn't
as
clear
as
i
intended
to
be.
it
does,
as
i
indicated,
have
the
language
about
the
private
home
of
the
employer.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
however,
the...
the
preceding
sentence
says
the
term,
referring
to
the
term
that
is
at
issue
in
552.3,
domestic
service
employment,
includes
persons
who
are
frequently
referred
to
as
private
household
workers.
the
fact
is
that
those
two
statements
are
inconsistent
with
each
other.
the
term
cannot
be
limited
to
employees
of
the
home
owner
and
also
include
persons
who
are
frequently
referred
to
as
private
household
workers,
at
least
if
one
means
all
the
persons
referred
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
the
specific
senate
report,
in
both
the
'73
and
the
'74
reports--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--what?
the
report
uses
the
term
private
households
workers
frequently
interchangeably
with
the
term
domestic
employees.
that
is
what
is
clear
from
the
report
itself.
now,
the
department
of
labor
when
it
was
reporting
to
congress,
as
congress
has
required
it
to
do,
the
department
of
labor
used
the
term
private
households
workers,
specifically
defined
in
there
by
the
department,
to
say
this
means
not
just
employees
employed
by
the
homeowner
but
also
people
who
are
employed
by
third
parties.
so
i
think
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
when
the
senate
report
was
using
that
phrase,
it
was
using
it
in
the
same
manner
that
the
department
of
labor
reports
have.
and,
in
fact,
at
one
point
in
the...
moving
further
backward
in
the
legislative
history,
senator
dominick
actually
quoted
that
language,
the
definition
from
the
department
of
labor,
on
the
senate
floor
during
the
debates.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
that's
not
correct.
there
was
a,
an
opinion
letter
from
the
department
in
november
of
1975...
this
is
an
opinion
letter
that's
cited
at
page
21
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief...
which
specifically
stated
that
the
exemption
applied
whether
the
employee
was
an
employee
of
the
homeowner
or
of
a
public
or
private--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i
misunderstood
the
time
frame
we
were
dealing
with.
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
actually
i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization
also.
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
made
a
division
among
third-party
employers.
it
said
the
exemption
would
not
be
available
to
those
third-party
employers
who
were
covered
enterprises
but
it
would
be
available
to
those
who
were
not
covered
enterprises.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
that
it
solicited
comments
on
that
proposal.
and
after
the
comments,
it
changed
its
position
to
say
no,
in
fact,
all
third-party
employers
will
be
exempt.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
if
i
can
just...
if
i
can
quibble
with
the
premise
of
the
question.
the
first
time
it
said
some
third-party
employers
would
be
exempt
and
some
wouldn't.
then
when
it
changed--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct...
those
would
be
the
ones
under
the
proposed
rulemaking
that
would
have
been
denied
the
exemption.
when
in
fact...
when,
in
fact,
the
labor
department
said
no,
in
fact,
the
exemption
should
apply
to
all
third-party
employers,
it
said
it
found
that
more
consistent
with
the
statutory
language.
and
it
also
said
it
was
more
consistent
with
what
it
had
done
under
other
regulations
which
had
been
passed
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
justice
stevens,
to
be
honest
with
you.
i
mean
one
of
the
difficulties
here
in
answering
that
is
that
i
think,
because
the
department
has
such
broad
authority
under
213(a)(15)
to
define
and
delimit
the
term,
i
think
what's
consistent
with
the
statute
has
expanded
somewhat.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
to
say
i
don't
really
see
where
there
would
be
in
the
language
of
the
statute
any
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
different
kinds
of
third-party
employers.
the
phraseology
in
the
coverage
provisions,
the
phraseology
in
the
exemption
provisions,
really
doesn't
allow
for
that
in
terms
of
any
sort
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
it's
possible,
but
as
i
say,
the...
i
mean,
among
the
difficulties
that
covered
enterprises
is
not
just
corporations
and
big
and
small
corporations.
covered
enterprises
beginning
in
1974
includes
state
and
local
governments.
so
what
congress
would
have
been
addressing
here,
if
it
had
been
squarely
facing
the
issue,
would
have
not
just
been
the
question
of
how
to
treat
large
and
small
corporations,
but
whether
it
wanted
to
deny
the
exemption
to
covered
enterprises
such
as
state
and
local
agencies
who,
in
fact,
do
provide
a
lot
of
the
direct
employees
who
provide
companionship
care.
they
have
a
lot
of
employees
who
actually
go
into
homes
and
care
for
people
who
are
employed
by
state
and
local
governments.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
bit
unusual
for
congress,
who
is
reasonably
solicitous
of
state
interests,
to
deny
them
an
exemption
that
would
have
been
of
considerable
importance
to
them.
as
the
state
of...
or
the
city
of
new
york
brief
points
out,
this
is
a
very
extensive
endeavor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
but
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
important
point
is
they
were
not
covered
prior
to
1974.
there
were
certain--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
they
were...
they
were,
if
they
worked
in
schools
or
institutions
like
hospitals.
other
than
that,
they
were
not
until
1974.
that's
exactly
correct.
this,
in
fact,
would
have
been
denying
them
an
exception
at
the
very
time
that
for
other
occupations
aside
from
companionship
services,
they
were
first
having
coverage
applied
to
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
certainly
think
it
would.
i
take
it
respondents
in
this
case
would
disagree
and
would
point
to
the
language
of
552.3.
i'm
not
sure,
for
example,
how
the
second
circuit
would
have
resolved
that
question,
given
the
way
it
viewed
the
statute
here.
but
we
do
think
that
that
would
apply
and
so
i
think
one
view
of
that
would
be
it's
largely
prospective.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
how
respondent
would
reconcile
the
regulation
552.3
and
109(a)
actually
did
not
i
believe
attempt
any
reconciliation.
if
i
understand
respondent's
position
correctly,
it's
simply
109(a)
has
to
be
invalidated
dated
and
552.3
stands
in
its
entirety.
i
think
that's
incorrect
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
basis
for
it
is
essentially
this
apparent
distinction
between
the
define
and
delimit
authority
and
the
more
general
authority
to
enact
necessary
rules
and
regulation.
but,
in
fact,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
in
his
question,
both
grants
of
authority
were
invoked
by
the
department
when
it
enacted
both
regulations
simultaneously,
not
limited
to
either
subpart
a
or
subpart
b,
and
for
the
reasons
that
justice
alito
points
out,
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
to
attribute
to
the
department
to
say
that
it
would
exercise
two
different
legislative
powers
in
different
parts
of
the...
of
the
regulations.
there's
no
reason
it
would
do
that.
the
subpart
b
regulations
clearly
are
regulations
that
delimit
the
terms
of
the
exemption
in
213(a)(15).
there's
no
question
about
that.
so
why
in
fact
if
it
was
doing
what
congress
authorized
it
to
do
under
213(a)(15),
would
it
instead
of
relying
on
the
grant
of
authority
in
that
provision,
rely
on
some
other
general
grant
of
authority?
it
makes
no
logical
sense
to
attribute
that
to
the
department.
and
it
seems
to
me,
in...
excuse
me...
in
fact,
that
that
argument
points
up
one
of
the
difficulties
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
arguments
here
are
a
way
of
simply
trying
to
push
the
department
aside
so
that
the
courts
can
ultimately
do
the
final
job
of
exposition
on
this
exemption.
not
only
contrary
to
the
basic
principle
of
chevron,
which
is
where
that
where
is
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
or
room
for
interpretation,
the
agencies
are
given
the
opportunity
to
do
that
within
reasonable
bounds;
it
is
also
contrary
to
the
statute.
it
is
clear
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument,
the
department
was
the
agency
chosen
by
congress
to
do
the
work
of
defining
and
delimiting
the
exception.
now
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
other
thing
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
particular
nature
of
the
litigation.
this
is
a
suit
for
damages.
it
is
a
suit
claiming
willful
damages.
thank
you,
your
honor.
