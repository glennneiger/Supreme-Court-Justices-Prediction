mr.
harold
c.
becker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
october
1,
1974,
just
five
months
after
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
took
effect,
the
department
of
labor
exercised
its
delegated
law-making
function
to
define
this
term
"domestic
service
employment",
which
exists
in
the
companionship
exemption
and
nowhere
else
in
the
amendments.
and
they
defined
its
clearly
and
explicitly
to
apply
only
to
companions
and
baby
sitters
employed
by
the
household.
at
the
same
time,
dol
provided
a
persuasive
explanation
for
that
definition.
the
department
found
that
such
companions
and
baby
sitters
when
employed
by
covered
enterprises
had
been
covered
prior
to
the
amendments
and
that
it
could
not
have
been
congress'
purpose,
when
amendments
were
explicitly
designed
to
extend
coverage,
to
at
the
same
time
contract
coverage.
the
very
preamble
to
the
act
states
that
the
purposes
of
the
amendments
are
to
expand
the
coverage
of
the
act.
therefore,
the
dol
itself
concluded
in
october
of
1974
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
those
amendments
to
deny
the
act's
protection
to
previously
covered
domestic
service
employees.
the
definition
in
552.3,
which
expressly
applies
only
to
the
exemption,
conflicts
directly
with
the
final
third-party
regulation.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
the
final
regulations
were
promulgated
in
february
of
2005.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
no,
no,
your
honor.
that
was
in
the
final
regulations,
which
were
promulgated
in
february...
excuse
me...
in
1975,
not
2005.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
in
the
final
regulations.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
that
was
in
the
final
regulations
in
february
of
75.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
that's
correct.
there's
a
direct
conflict.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
your
honor,
the
definitional
regulation,
552.3,
explicitly
defines
a
term
used
only
in
the
companionship
services
exemption,
"domestic
service
employment".
and
it
defines
it
clearly
and
explicitly
to
apply
only
to
employment
by
the
household.
therefore,
there
is
a
direct
conflict
with
the
so-called
third
party
employer
regulation,
which
appears
to
say
that
the
exemption
can
apply
to
employees
employed
by
third
parties.
the
importance
of
the
conflict
is
twofold.
one,
when
the
original
regulation
was
proposed
the
department
provided
a
persuasive
explanation.
congress
surely
didn't
intend
to
contract
coverage
in
amendments
designed
explicitly
to
expand
coverage.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
your
honor,
that
question
has
been
posed
by
some
of
the
amici
and
it
is
a
good
question,
but
not
the
question
before
you.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
and
i
submit
that
if
the
department
construed
section
552.3
to
say
when
our
words
say
"employed
by
the
household"
that
could
include
a
broader
notion
of
the
household,
for
example
a
son
or
daughter
living
outside
the
household,
that
might
be
a
permissible
construction
of
the
department's
own
regulation.
but
the
construction
which
simply
takes
those
words--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--it's
a
very
important
question
of
public
policy
and
therefore
let
me
answer
in
two
ways.
one,
i
think
there
is
a
proper
procedure
even
under
the
existing
regulations
to
address
that
concern.
the
elderly
individual
that
you're
concerned
about
who
is
severely
disabled
and
thus
needs
this
care,
the
child
or
family
member
who
is
employing
the
companion
to
care
for
them
could
do
so
as
their
guardian,
and
therefore
as
a
technical
legal
matter
would
be
doing
so,
the
employment
would
be
by
the
person
who
resides
in
the
home.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
exactly.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
a
clever
lawyer
could
do
this.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
but
let
me
answer
the
second--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--let
me
answer
a
second
way
to
what
is
a
serious
concern.
and
the
second
way
the
situation
could
be
dealt
with
is
by
the
department
of
labor.
they
could
look
at
their
regulations
and
say,
the
industry
has
changed
and
therefore,
in
a
way
which
could
certainly
be
consistent
with
congress's
intent
because
it
would
not
be
withdrawing
coverage
from
a
previously
covered
employee
who
was
employed
by
an
enterprise,
we
could
say
that
the
exemption
applies
to
companions
and
baby
sitters
employed
by
private
individuals,
including
the
homeowner,
the
son
or
daughter,
etcetera.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
as
an
empirical
matter,
that
is
clearly
the
case,
justice
stevens.
however,
we
know
several
things
about
congress
in
1974.
we
know
that
the
enterprise
coverage
was
relatively
new.
they
adopted
it
in
1961,
expanded
it
in
1966,
and
indeed
expanded
these
very
amendments
in
1974.
so
congress
was
aware
of
the
prior
coverage.
we
know
that
the
department
of
labor,
in
the
very
reports
which
have
been
cited
by
the
petitioner,
stated
both
in
january
of
1973
and
in
january
of
1974
in
their
reports
to
congress
on
the
act,
stated
that
there
was
prior
coverage
of
domestics
employed
by
third
parties.
we
know
there
was
enforcement
activity
by
the
department
of
labor
against
such
third-party
employers.
so
while
the
industry
has
certainly
changed,
there
were
enterprises
who
employed
domestics,
including
companions,
in
1974,
and
congress
was
aware
of
it
and
stated
over
and
over
again
in
the
preamble,
in
the
committee
reports,
which
indeed,
the
house
committee
report
said,
"our
intention
is
to
expand
the
act
to
the
extent
of
federal
power.
"
mr.
harold
c.
becker
your
honor,
we
think
it
is
the
most
plausible
interpretation
for
the
following
reasons:
number
one,
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested,
the
language
in
the
exemption
is
not
identical
to
the
language
in
the
extension
provision
extending
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
requirements.
there
is
an
important
difference,
and
that
difference
is
the
word
employment.
now
that's
important
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
of
course,
coverage
provisions
are
to
be
read
broadly
and
exemptions
narrowly.
so
there's
an
additional
word
that
can
and
would
suggest
it
should
be
read
as
a
term
of
limitation.
number
two,
that
difference
must
be
given
significance,
if
possible.
the
word
should
not
be
read
to
mean
the
same
as
the
coverage
provisions
when
it
doesn't
exist
in
the
coverage
provisions.
and
number
three,
we
should
avoid
redundancy.
there
is
a
reading
of
that
unique
language,
"domestic
service
employment",
which
makes
sense
and
in
fact,
is
exactly
the
reading
given
by
the
department.
congress
did
not
intend
to--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--the
word
domestic
service
employment
is
not
necessary
to
describe
what
you
described,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
that
is
what
the
congress
intended
to
describe,
it
could
have
said
simply
an
employee
employed
to
provide
companionship
services.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
your
honor--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--what
i'm
suggesting
is
not
that
our
case
relies
or
hangs
on
that
word.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
if
that
word,
that
phrase,
"domestic
service
employment",
is
given
the
definition
which
the
department
of
labor
itself
gave
it,
it
avoids
reading
two
phrases
which
are
different
to
mean
the
same
thing.
it
avoids
redundancy.
and
moreover,
it
is
wholly
consistent
with
every
other
piece
of
evidence
we
have
about
congress's
intent.
even
the
department
of
labor
suggested
it
surely
could
not
have
been
congress's
intent
to
retract
coverage.
the
definition
is
consistent
with
that.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
my
solution,
your
honor,
has
two
parts
but
leads
to
the
same
conclusion.
our
solution
is
that
in
applying
the
act,
which
is
the
question
here,
does
the
act
apply
to
ms.
coke's
employment,
this
court
should
apply
the
definitional
regulations
for
two
reasons,
the
definitional
regulation
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
is
the
regulation,
which
no
one
disputes,
and
was
promulgated
in
the
exercise
of
the
department's
law
making
function.
the
department
expressly
defined
and
delimited
its
term
552.3
and
expressly
said
it
was
not
doing
so
in
the
third-party
regulation.
so
it's
entitled
to
greater
deference
for
that
reason.
but
moreover--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--it
is
the
only
definition
which
makes
sense,
which
doesn't
lead
to
a
whole
series
of
problems.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
for--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--for
the
following
five
reasons,
your
honor.
one,
it
avoids
reading
a
term
in
the
statute,
not
only
a
term
in
the
regulation
but
a
term
in
the
statute,
completely
out
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
the
term
"employment".
secondly,
as
the
department
found,
it
is
consistent
with
what
was
congress's
clear
intent,
to
expand
and
not
to
contract
coverage.
thirdly,
if
one
looks
at
the
debates,
and
there
was
extensive
and
vigorous
debate
about
these
amendments,
the
exclusive
focus
in
congress
was
the
household.
the
opponents
were
exclusively
concerned
with
the
extension
of
coverage
to
the
households.
so
applying
the
exemption
to
protect
only
household
employees
is
wholly
consistent
with
what
was
congress's
exclusive--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--your
honor,
of
course
setting
aside,
as
you
do,
our
argument
that
congress
has
specific
intent
on
this
question,
looking
only
at
the
regulation--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--let
me
answer
in
several
ways.
first,
this
court
has
clearly
held
that
an
agency
does
not
have
unbounded
discretion
to
construe
its
own
regulations.
when
the
terms
of
the
regulations
are
unambiguous,
they
cannot
be
construed
away.
now
here--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--again,
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
there's
a
difference
between
conflict
and
ambiguity.
the
words
are
unambiguous,
and
it's
not
simply
the...
there's
two
sets
of
words
which
they
attempt
to
read
out
of
the
regulation,
one
of
the
unambiguous
words
that
require
employment
by
the
person
who's
living
in
the
home,
and
the
other
is
the
prefatory
language
which
says
the
regulation
only
applies
to
the
exemption.
so
in
the
guise
of
deference,
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioners
actually
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
should
take
apart
the
regulation
and
ignore
two
of
its
three
operative
provisions.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
that
is
certainly
my
primary
argument,
that
this
statute
is
relatively
unique
in
that
it
vested
two
very
different
sorts
of
authority
in
the
department
of
labor,
one
a
clear
law
making
authority
to
actually
define
and
delimit,
to
specify
what
the
terms
in
the
law
mean--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--your
honor,
it
not
only
makes
sense,
it's
been
the
department's
pattern
since
the
act
was
adopted.
that
is,
the
department
since
the
act
was
adopted
has
split
its
regulations
into
those
under
the
exemptions...
for
example
the
primary
exemption
for
professional,
executive
and
administrative
employees...
has
split
its
regulations
under
those
exemptions
into
those
which
define
and
delimit,
into
those
which
do
not
define
and
delimit,
or
other
general
statements
that
apply
to
their
interpretation.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
the
important
difference
here,
justice
scalia,
is
the
statute.
the
statute,
like
the
tax
statute
which
was
interpreted
by
this
court
in
vogel
and
rowan,
creates
two
types
of
authority.
and
not
only
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--your
honor--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--well,
let
me
qualify
the
question,
if
i
might.
the
petitioner
would
suggest
that
we're
relying
on
simply
a
label,
this
is
in
the
interpretive
section
and
the
other
is
in
the
general
regulation
section.
far
from
it.
we
are
relying
on
a
very
clear
statement
both
in
the
regulations,
552.2(c),
as
well
as
in
both
the
proposed
regulations
and
the
final
regulations,
which
clearly
state
that
only
those
in
part
a
define
and
delimit.
why
is
that
an
important
distinction?
it's
an
important
distinction
because
congress
clearly
meant
these
two
grants
to
be
different.
otherwise,
why
would
it
have
granted
an
express
power
to
define
and
delimit
which
would
otherwise
be
redundant
of
the
general
rulemaking
authority?
mr.
harold
c.
becker
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
in
1974
when
congress
created
these
two
types
of
authority,
it
did
so
with
knowledge
of
the
law.
and
this
court,
if
you
compare
its
decision
in
addison
to
its
decision
in
skidmore,
clearly
itself
distinguished
between
the
exercise
of
those
two
different
interpretive
or
rulemaking
authority.
clearly
in
addison,
construing
a
very
similar
term
in
a
different
exemption,
giving
the
department
of
labor
the
power
to
define
a
particular
term
in
the
exemption,
said
that
is
law
making
authority.
and
we
will
follow
what
the
department
of
labor
says
unless
it's
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
statutory...
with
congress's
intent.
in
skidmore,
where
that
type
of
expressed
delegated
law
making
authority
to
define
and
delimit
was
not
at
issue,
the
court
said
we
will
record
only
that
degree
of
deference
to
which
the
regulation--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--absolutely,
your
honor.
but
it
was
also
before
the
1974
amendment.
so
if
the
question
is,
what
was
congress
intending
in
creating
two
types
of
rulemaking
authority,
the
power
to
define
and
delimit,
and
the
general
rulemaking
authority,
i
think
we
need
to
consider
congress's
intent
at
that
time.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
let
me
answer
in
two
ways,
your
honor.
one,
it
would
not
be
any
case.
here
we
have
a
particular
statutory
scheme
that
is
contrary
to--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--here
we
have
a
case
essentially
described
by
justice
kennedy
in
haga,
where
we
have
a
different
statutory
scheme
combined
with
a
explicit
statement
by
the
agency
as
to
which
part
of
that
scheme
the
agency
is
operating
under.
but
the
case
i
would
cite,
or
the
cases
would
be
rolo
and
rove
which
have
not--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--well,
i
think
the
question,
your
honor,
is
which
of
the
regulations
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
specific
authority--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--well,
i
think
what
you
missed
is
that
a
simple
citation
to
the
exemption
does
not
translate
into
an
exercise
of
the
power
to
define
and
delimit.
because
the
department
was
very,
very
specific
as
to
when
it
was
exercising
that
power.
in
552.2(c)
it
says
the
definitions
required
by
the
legislation
are
provided
in
the
following
sections
and
it
enumerates
them
and
does
not
include
the
third-party
regulation.
now
petitioners
would
suggest
well,
that's
just
a
definition.
they
also
have
the
power
to
delimit.
however,
both
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
and
the
notice
of
final
rulemaking
said
that
we
are
exercising
our
power
to
define
and
delimit
in
subpart
a.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
but
part
b
is
different.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
and
its
certainly
not
the
way
that
the--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--that's
correct.
but
the
regulation...
552.3
defines
the
statutory
term
which
only
exists
in
the
exemption,
domestic
service
employment.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
well,
i
think
we
have
to
read
the
definitional
regulations
together.
that
is,
all
of
the
terms
in
the
exemption,
companionship
services,
babysitting
services,
casual
basis,
domestic
service
employment,
are
all
defined
in
the
set
of
regulations,
point
3,
point
4,
point
5,
point
6.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
prefatory
language
of
each
one
that
what
the
department
of
labor
intended
to
do
was
define
the
terms
in
the
statute.
and
so
when
it
said
that
that
term
refers
to--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
power
to
define
the
term
and
i
don't
think
we
can
take
that
language
"refers
to"
to
be
non-exclusive.
when
the
department
said
referred
it
was
defining
a
statutory
term
as
it
said
it
was.
if
we
have
any
doubt
about
what
the
department
intended,
it
actually
of
course
reiterated
that
definition
under
the
interpretive
classification.
and
it
again
said
that
the
term
refers
to,
is
defined
as,
employment
by
the
household.
if
we
had
any
doubt--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--i'm
referring
to
an
earlier
provision
of
the
same
regulation,
not
the
reference
to
private
household
workers,
but
where
it
states
that
the
definition
includes
those
individuals
who
are
employed
by
the
household,
that
is
in
552.101(a).
but
if
we
had
any
further
doubt,
the...
that
regulation
refers
to,
as
its
source
of
the
language,
the
regulation
adopted
under
the
social
security
act,
now
20
cfr
404.1057.
it
was
originally
numbered
differently,
but
at
the
time,
in
1974,
that
regulation
which
was
explicitly
the
source
of
the
language
the
department
of
labor
used,
said
not
once,
not
twice,
but
three
times,
that
the
individual
had
to
be
employed
by
the
household.
mr.
harold
c.
becker
your
honor,
setting
aside,
of
course,
all
the
reasons
about
congress's
intent
in
552.3
which
we've
already
explained,
we
would
not
say
that
that
there
is
any
credible
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
text
of
the
act
to
suggest
that
cost
was
a
factor.
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
department
for
the
first
time
when
it
promulgated
its
advisory
memorandum
suggested
this
was
the
basis
of
the
third
party
regulation.
it
said
nothing
of
the
sort
in
1975.
as
support
for
the
assertion
it
cited
four
isolated
comments
in
the
legislative
history.
none
of
them
except
the
last...
and
there
is
only
one
of
them
related
in
any
way
to
the
exemption.
the
one
that
related
to
the
exemption
in
fact
directly
supports
our
position,
because
it
describes
those
people
who
are
not
within
the
exemption
as
the
professional
domestics.
so
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
for
suggesting
that
cost
was
the
underlying
rationale;
and,
in
fact,
it
is
really
implausible.
because
at
the
same
time,
for
example,
congress
extended
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
covered
nursing
homes.
at
the
same
time,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
congress
only
exempted
casual
babysitters.
now
we
would
submit
that
if
congress
was
concerned
about
cost,
in
creating
this
babysitter
and
companionship
exemption,
the
primary
intended
beneficiaries
of
that
would
have
been
working
families
where
both
people
worked
and
therefore
who
require
a
full-time
baby
sitter--
mr.
harold
c.
becker
--and
a
full-time
babysitter
is
not
covered.
thank
you
very
much.
