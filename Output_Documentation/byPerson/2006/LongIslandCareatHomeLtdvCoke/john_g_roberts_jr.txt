chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-593,
long
island
care
at
home
versus
coke.
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
farr.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
department
of
labor
had
enacted
its
regulations
as
originally
proposed,
those
regulations
would
have
been
invalid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
seemingly
conflicted.
they
conflict.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
same
time
that--
552.3
was
finally
promulgated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
came
out
together,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how...
putting
aside...
putting
552.109
aside,
how
is
552.3
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
employment
would
someone
who's
hired
by
a
third
party
be
engaged
in
if
not
domestic
service
employment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ought
not
to
get
as
much
deference
from
the
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
are
you
sure
there's
a
conflict
in
the
first
place?
you
know,
552.3
says
that
the
term
domestic
service
employment
refers
to
services
performed
in
the
home
of
the
employer.
it
doesn't
say
it
only
refers
to
that.
and
then
you
go
down
and
109
says
it
also
includes
employees
who
are
employed
by
a
third
party.
i
mean,
can't
they
be
reconciled
in
that
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
the
way
the
agency
has
done
it.
but
you
don't
think
we
should
defer
to
them,
anyway.
so...--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
it
says
it
refers
to
something.
it
doesn't
say
as
many
of
these
regulations
and
statutes
do,
is,
you
know,
it
is
defined
as.
and
particularly
when
you're
confronted
with
what
would
otherwise
be
a
conflict,
maybe
refers
to
should
be
read
to
mean
includes
rather
than
is
defined
as.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
it
is
interesting
when
you
look
at...
i
mean,
they're...
it's
a
good
point.
it's
interesting
when
you
look
at
the
other
definitions,
the
babysitting,
it
says
this
provision
shall
mean.
here
it
just
says
it
refers
to.
let's
see,
the
other
ones...
casual
basis,
shall
mean.
companionship
services,
shall
mean.
this
one
doesn't
say
shall
mean.
it
says
it
refers
to
this.
i'm
just
wondering
if
that's
something
that
suggests
it's
not
intended
to
be
as
exclusive
as
the
other
definitions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
it
says...
there
it
says
includes.
and
if
you're
talking
about
552.101,
there
it
says
the
term
includes
persons
frequently
referred
to
as
private
household
workers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
farr,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
