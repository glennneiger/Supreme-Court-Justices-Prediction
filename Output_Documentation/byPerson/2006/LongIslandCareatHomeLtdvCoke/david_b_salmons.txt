mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
flsa's
companionship
services
exemption
applies
by
its
terms
to
any
employee
employed
in
domestic
service
employment
to
provide
companionship
services
for
the
aged
or
infirm.
the
act
imposes
no
limitation
based
on
the
identity
of
the
employer.
and
the
agency's
regulation
of
552.109
extending
the
exception
to
employees
of
third
parties
is
entitled
to
deference.
the
department
expressly
invoked
its
statutory
rulemaking
authority
in
adopting
section
109,--
552.109.
it
utilized
ed
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
procedures
both
in
1975
and
each
time
it
considered
amending
the
regulation.
and
states
and
care
providers
have
relied
upon
it
in
devising
systems
to
provide
appropriate
services
to
the
aged
and
the
infirm.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
if
you're
referring
to
the
initial
proposed
rulemaking
that
would
have
exempted
only
some
third
parties,
we
think
that
would
have
been
a
permissible
reading
of
the
exemption
given
the
fact
that
the
secretary
is
provided
very
broad
defined
limit
authority.
but
we
certainly
think
there's
nothing
in
that
exemption
that
precludes
the
construction
that's
been
adopted
here.
in
fact,
we
think
it
is
the
most
consistent
with
that
language.
the
language
of
552.3
upon
which
respondent
relies
does
not
change
that
conclusion.
while
if
read
in
isolation
that
language
could
require
that
domestic
service
employees
have
to
provide
their
services
in
the
home
of
the
employer,
it
should
be
not...
it
should
not
be
given
that
reading
for
the
reasons
explained
in
the
department's
2005
advisory
memorandum.
the
department's
construction
of
its
own
regulations
contained
in
that
memorandum
is
itself
entitled
to
deference
under
our
and
seminole
rock
and
its
construction
harmonizes
the
various
provisions
at
issue
here
far
better
than
respondent's
reading
of
552.3
does.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
and
that's
tied
to
a
specific
term
that
only
applies
to
the
exemption
as
to
babysitters.
the
only
thing
that's
exempt
with
regard
to
babysitters
is
babysitting
on
a
casual
basis.
congress
certainly
could
have
included
a
casual
basis
requirement
with
regard
to
the
exemption
for
companionship
services.
we
think
it's
very
notable
that
it
did
not
and
we
read
from
that
that
congress
wanted
all
domestic
service
employees
providing
companionship
services
to
be
exempt,
and
we
think
that's
most
consistent
with
the
goal
of
ensuring
that
those
individuals
who
most
need
this
type
of
care
have
the
opportunity
to
receive
them
at
a
reasonable
cost.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
we
think
that
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
companionship
services
exemption,
but
we
don't
think
that's
odd
based
on
the
department
of
labor's
view
of
what
the
purpose
of
that
exemption
is
and
based
on
the
textual
difference
between,
for
example,
the
exemption
for
baby
sitting
services
and
the
exemption
for
companionship
services.
the
exemption
here
expresses
no
limitation
based
on
the
identity
of
the
employer
and
we
think
it
was
well
within
the
agency's
discretion
to
conclude
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
here
was
a
categorical
exemption
based
on
the
type
of
services
that
are
being
provided;
and
while
that
may
mean
that
there
are
certain
workers
who
are
now
exempt
who
were
not
previously
exempt,
that's
because
congress
for
the
first
time
in
1974
focused
on
this
problem
of
companionship
services
being
provided
to
those
who
cannot
care
for
themselves;
and
we
think
that
follows
from
the
text,
and
for
the
reasons
congress
adopted
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
there
is
a
safe
harbor
provision
that
allows
for
reliance
by
employers
on
a
statement
by
the
agency.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i'm
sorry?
what
would
be
given
prospective
effect?
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
that
is
our
view.
again,
i
think
that
would
be
an
issue
that
would
be
litigated
and
i'm
sure
litigated
heavily
in
the
hundreds
of
cases
that
are
being
filed
under
this
provision.
and
i
think
it's...
one
of
the
concerns
i
think
of
the
agency
here
was
to
provide
a
clear
statement
with
regard
to
how
these
seemingly
conflicting
provisions
of
the
regulation
are
to
be
reconciled
and
applied.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
i
certainly
don't
take
issue
with
that.
i
think
that
there
are
a
variety
of
things
that
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
language
in
552.3
that
refers
to
"in
the
home
of
the
employer.
"
simply
cannot
be
read
literally.
it
was
borrowed
from
the
social
security
context
and
if
read
the
way
respondents
do
we
think
would
raise
a
serious
question
about
the
scope
of
coverage
because
the
agency
has
always
viewed
552.3,
notwithstanding
the
initial
line
that
says
"for
purposes
of
the
exemption",
to
provide
the
relevant
definition
for
coverage
as
well.
and
no
party,
or
amici
for
that
matter,
before
this
court
nor
the
department
thinks
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
identity
of
the
employer
for
purposes
of
coverage.
and
we
also
think,
given
the
language
in
101
that
refers
to
private
household
workers,
the
definition
of
which
was
provided
to
congress
in
a
report
by
the
department
of
labor
and
is
relied
upon
in
the
advisory
memorandum
in
2005,
which
clearly
applies
to
third
party
employers,
suggests
that
552.3
cannot
be
read
literally.
and
of
course
we
know
that
at
the
same
time
that
the
agency
adopted
552.3
it
felt
the
need
to
adopt
a
specific
regulation
dealing
with
the
question
of
third-party
employment
which
would
not
be
relevant...
which
would
not
be
necessary
under
respondent's
reading.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
