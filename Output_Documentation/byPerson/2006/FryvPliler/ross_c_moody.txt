mr.
ross
c.
moody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
habeas
is
limited
in
scope
and
purpose.
it
is
not
a
continuation
of
the
appellate
process.
rather,
it
is
an
extraordinary
remedy
limited
by
fundamental
concepts
of
federalism,
comity,
and
state
sovereignty.
in
brecht,
this
court
held
that
the
stringent
chapman
standard
was
inappropriate
for
use
on
collateral
review.
instead,
in
order
to
strike
a
proper
balance
between
state
and
federal
interests,
the
actual
prejudice
standard
of
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict
should
be
used
in
collateral
cases.
petitioner
is
asking
for
an
exception
to
this
rule.
he
claims
that
if
he
did
not
receive
chapman
review
in
state
court,
he
should
receive
it
on
federal
habeas.
that
was
not
the
rule
in
brecht
and
it
should
not
be
adopted
by
this
court
here.
the
brecht
decision
did
not
state
an
exception
based
on
the
state
standard
used.
the
key
in
brecht
was
that
appropriate
balance
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state.
this
court
has
never
treated
cases
where
there
was
not
a
state
chapman
finding
differently
from
other
cases.
it
applies
brecht
throughout.
in
the
penry
case
and
in
the
o'neal
case
there
was
no
chapman
finding
in
state
court,
yet
this
court
applied
brecht
and
made
no
comment
about
that.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
agree,
the
likelihood
of
the
cert
grant
in
that
circumstance
is
slim
but
it
does
not
change
the
fact
that
once
you
come
to
court
under
2254,
you
are
asking
for
collateral
review.
and
in
collateral
review,
it's
inappropriate
to
apply
the
chapman
standard.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes,
your
honor.
first
you
would
ask
if
it
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
chapman.
if
you
found
that
it
was
not,
then
the
case
is
over,
there's
no
need
to
grant
the
writ.
if
you
found
that
it
was,
you
would
proceed
and
do
a
brecht
analysis.
and
that's
what
we
learned
from--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--i
don't
disagree.
i'm
merely
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
various
decisions
in
this,
in
this
arena.
there's
some
tension
between
the
esparza
decision
and
other
decisions
of
the
court;
and
one
has
to
find
a
place
for
aedpa
standard.
so
we
would
not
object
to
simply
an
application
of
brecht
which
is
what
this
court
has
always
done.
but
as
far
as
it
seems
to
suggest
there
may
be
an
interim
step.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
think
that
the
explanation
is
as
follows.
when
you're
analyzing
the
denial
of
a
defense
type
of
evidence,
a
chambers
claim,
you
first
look
to
see
how
it
fit
into
the
defense.
and
that
is
what
they
were
doing.
you're
not
looking
at
the
entire
case.
you're
looking
only
at
the
defense.
and
so
in
the
sense
that
something
is
better
than
nothing,
adding
a
twelfth
witness
instead
of
eleven
may
improve
the
defense
case.
and
yet
nonetheless,
when
you
move
to
the
next
question,
which
is,
was
there
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict
in
the
case,
and
now
you're
not
just
looking
at
the
defense,
you're
looking
at
everything
that
was
available
to
the
jury...
it
may
be
that
there
was
still
so
much
other
evidence
that
it
could
overcome
whatever
increase
you
received
on
the
defense.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
we
would
not
object
to
that.
i'm
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to
assist
justice
breyer
in
that
perceived
imbalance
between
a
finding
of
a
substance
above
and
then
a
finding
of
harmless
error
before.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes.
we
agree.
that's
certainly
the
law
of
this
court.
and
in
this,
in...
well,
let
me
move
on.
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
other
points.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
sure.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
no,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
you've
the
sixth
court
to
hear
this
case.
the
prior
five
have
all
rejected
his
claim.
and
while--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
for
purposes
of
argument
i
do.
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
both
applied
brecht
and
found
that
this
was
not
an
error
which--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--this
is
true.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes,
she
did.
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
no.
i
would
disagree
with
that.
she's
been
characterized
that
way.
but,
and
i
want
to
point
out
that,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
stevens.
you
asked
whether
or
not
she
saw
another
man
commit
the
murder.
and
counsel
appeared
to
agree
with
you.
that
was
not
her
testimony.
her
testimony
was
that
she
overheard
someone
else
confessing
to
murders
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
these
murders.
and
the...
and
this
was
a
very
long
case.
this
case
lasted
eleven
weeks,
it
involved
a
hundred
witnesses.
you
can
look
at
the
opinions
it
produced
in
state
court
and
in
the
district
court.
they're
each
100
pages
long.
it's
not
unreasonable
to
expect
the
jury
to
take
a
long
time
to
decide
that
case.
now
there
are
25
court
days
of
deliberations--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--five
weeks,
25
court
days,
24
of
which
were
taken
up
with
read
back.
several...
several
holidays.
i
mean
if
you
want
to
go
through
and
look
at
it,
now--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--i
haven't
attempted
to
find
one.
it
is
a
long
deliberation.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
believe
that
was...
i
keep,
i've
been
switching
back
and
forth
between
calendar
days
and
court
days.
so
forgive
me.
i
believe
that
was
on
the
eighth
court
day.
and
at
that
point,
when
they
announced
they
were
hung,
they
selected
a
new
foreperson
and
then
rolled
up
their
sleeves
and
went
back
in
and
deliberated
the
case.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
and
after--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--after
they
selected
the
new
foreperson,
they
asked
for
15
read
backs,
including
the
crucial
evidence
in
the
case.
the
ballistics
experts.
they
asked
for
that.
they
asked
for
the
testimony
of
the
in-custody
witness
who
heard
the
confession
of
mr.
fry.
they
asked
for
mr.
fry's
testimony.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
well,
mrs.
maples'
testimony
was
not
admitted.
it
was
excluded.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
but
they
did
not...
significantly
they
did
not
ask
for
read
back
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
similarly
to,
to
ms.
maples.
the
third
party
culpability
case
was
basically
not
credited
by
the
jury.
they
did
not
a
read
back
of
those
witnesses.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
carefully
look
at
what
ms.
maples
was
going
to
say.
if
you
look
in
her
own
words,
and
i'm
quoting:
i
was
just
in
and
out
of
the
room.
i
just
listened
to
bits
and
pieces
of
it.
and
that's
at
joint
appendix
10.
this,
this
witness
may
have
been
mr.
hurtz's
cousin,
and
not
his
ex-girlfriend,
or
his
ex-girlfriend's
mother,
but
she
did
not
have
very
much
to
say
about
this.
she
said
she
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
the
statement.
she
could
not
tell
you
whether
it
was
a
serious
discussion.
she
was
in
and
out
of
the
room.
she
heard
only
bits
and
pieces.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
with
respect,
that's
not
what
she
heard.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
what
she
heard
was
a
statement
that
he
had
killed
a
man
and
a
woman.
and
this
was
not
immediately
after
the
offense.
this
is
18
months
after
the
offense,
this
is
not
the
next
day.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
well,
you
don't
do
it
very
often.
i
understand
that
that's
something
you
could
do
if
you
wanted
to.
i
think
that
this
is
just
a
classic
case
where
two
courts
applied
the
brecht
standard
and
reached
their
conclusions
and
there's
nothing
really
remarkable
about
it.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
hurtz.
yes.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
actually,
i'm
thinking
about
my
answer
because
i
was
thinking
about
borelli.
there
were
three
third
party
culpability,
potential
targets
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
that
hurtz,
the
testimony
of
several
of
the
witness
who
were
admitted
did
testify
of
a
link
between
cindy
bell
and
hurtz.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
in
order
to...
i
need
to
correct
the
record
on
that
as
well.
the
trial
judge
did
not
find
that
this
was
cumulative.
he
found
a
lack
of
foundation.
what
happened
was,
was
ms.
maples
was
offered
as
a
witness--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--the
alternative
prejudice
holding,
the
footnote
17,
they
said
it
would
have
been
cumulative.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
yes.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
oh,
that's
right.
yes.
there
was,
and
that's
really
my
point.
my
point
is
that
11
third
party
culpability
witnesses
were
allowed
to
testify
in
this
trial.
and
one
was
excluded.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
well--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--well,
for
one
thing,
he
was
called
to
testify
and
asked
if
he
killed
these
people.
mr.
hurtz
testified
at
this
trial.
the
jury
got
to
see
him,
they
got
to
look
him
in
the
eye,
they
got
to
hear
him
on
direct,
they
got
to
hear
him
on
cross.
and
they
did
not
ask
for
a
read
back
of
that
testimony.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
well,
he
stated
he
never
said
he
killed
these
people.
and
he,
he
stated
he'd
never
said
he
killed
a
man
and
a
woman
in
a
car.
so
it...
it
went
to
what
maples
would
have
said,
and
also--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--he
also
denied
doing
that.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
would
disagree,
simply
because
she
says
she
didn't
hear
the
conversation
well
enough
to
really
give
her
testimony
any
true
probative
value
in
the
case
because
she
was
in
and
out
of
the
room.
she
didn't
hear
the
beginning.
she
didn't
hear
the
end.
and
when
she's
asked,
was
it
a
serious
discussion,
she
says,
i
don't
know.
so
this
could
be...
this
could
be
something
very
different--
mr.
ross
c.
moody
--ordinarily
i
would
agree
with
that.
and
if
we
knew,
your
honor,
that
he
was
speaking
about
these
killings,
then
certainly
it
would
go
to
the
weight.
but
since
he
was
speaking
about
killings
that
she
said
she
didn't
know
if
they
were
in
california,
new
jersey,
she
didn't
know
when
they
occurred,
and
therefore...
in
california
we
ask
that
before
you
present
third
party
culpability
evidence
you
tie
it
to
this
crime.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
well,
it's...
he
may
have
committed
other
killings,
but
if
did
not
confess
to
committing
these
killings
then
there's
no
probative
value
to
her
testimony.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
no.
i
briefed
it
because
i
was
concerned
that
the
court
might
reach
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
fairly
presented.
the
only
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
if
one
accepts
petitioner's
rule
it
will
basically
swallow
up
the
brecht
standard
and
return
to
a
near
wholesale
application
of
chapman
on
collateral
review.
as
tyson
and
trigg
pointed
out,
many,
many
times
petitioners
come
to
court
and
they
have
a
case
where
there
was
no
finding
of
constitutional
error
in
state
court
and
therefore
no
chapman
application,
but
they're
going
to
assert
that
in
federal
court.
and
so
if
in
every
one
of
those
cases
you
apply
chapman,
then
you
really
have
reduced
application
of
brecht.
mr.
ross
c.
moody
i
don't
think
we
should
assume
that
the
state
courts
are
going
to
do
that.
i
think
that
what...
it's
sort
of
like
what
we
said
earlier
in
the
argument,
your
honor,
where
not
every
evidentiary
ruling
is
a
constitutional
violation.
i
would
say
most
of
them
are
not.
and
this
court
has
not
drawn
a
bright
line
of
exactly
where
that
is.
so
in
many
cases,
this
is
just
an
erroneous
exclusion
of
evidence
at
best.
and
so,
therefore,
the
state
court
would
not
be
going
to
a
chapman
standard
because
it
would
not
be
finding
error.
and
with
that,
i'm
prepared
to
submit.
