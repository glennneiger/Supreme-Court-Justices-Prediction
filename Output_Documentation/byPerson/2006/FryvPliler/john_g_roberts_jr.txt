chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-5247,
fry
versus
pliler.
mr.
haltom.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion
in
brecht,
the
brecht
standard
on
harmlessness
is
based
on
the
structural
consideration
that
your
under
collateral
review
at
that
point,
rather
than
under
direct
review.
you
would
apply
a
different
harmlessness
standard
that
doesn't
seem
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
it's
collateral
review
rather
than
direct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
that's
where
maybe
we...
is
the
subject
of
debate,
whether
the
central
theme
in
brecht
was,
this
is
collateral
review,
and
that
calls
for
a
different
standard,
or
whether
the
central
theme
was
chapman
review
had
been
undertaken,
and
therefore,
that
calls
for
a
different
standard.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
the
latter
is
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
page
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
in
the
question
presented?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
now
arguing
that
under
brecht
this
should
not
have
been
harmless;
is
that
the
point
you're
making?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
wouldn't
help
us
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
between
which
standard
is
applicable,
though,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
haltom.
mr.
moody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
the
state
court
had
conducted
a
chapman
review,
erroneously,
how
would
that
be
reviewed
under
federal
habeas?
you
would
ask
under
aedpa
whether
it
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
chapman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
seems
awfully
refined,
doesn't
it,
to
do
two
different
analyses?
is
this
an...
is
this
an
unreasonable
application
of
chapman?
and
then
apply
the
brecht
standard
after
determining
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
chapman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
the
question
of
the
application
of
brecht
is
included
within
the
questions
presented?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
if
we're
going
to
apply
the
brecht
standard
ourselves,
we
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
or
inference
that
it
was
close
on
the
alternative
murderer
theory,
which
is
the
only
thing
that
maples'
testimony
goes
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
haltom,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
strong
is
this
witness,
who
didn't
even
know
if
it
was
a
serious
conversation,
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
it,
and
didn't...
couldn't
tell
whether
he
was
talking
about
something
that
happened
10
years
before
or
2
days
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
