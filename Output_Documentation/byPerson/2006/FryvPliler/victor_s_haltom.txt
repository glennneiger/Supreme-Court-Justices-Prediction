mr.
victor
s.
haltom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
error
that
occurred
in
mr.
fry's
third
trial
is
the
type
of
error
that
can
result
in
a
conviction
of
an
innocent
person.
notwithstanding
the
nature
of
the
error
that
occurred
in
mr.
fry's
trial,
no
court
has
reviewed
the
effect
of
that
error
or
evaluated
the
effect
of
that
error
under
the
constitutionally
mandated
chapman
standard.
mr.
fry's
position
is
simply
that
he
is
entitled
to
one
bite
at
the
chapman
apple.
in
the
california
court
of
appeals,
that
state
appellate
court
should
have,
but
did
not,
rectify
the
constitutional
trial
error
that
occurred
in
this
case.
had
that
court
complied
with
this
court's
precedent,
that
court
would
have
first
identified
the
constitutional
error
that
occurred
at
trial,
namely
the
chambers
error,
and
second,
reviewed
the
effect
of
that
error,
assessed
the
effect
of
that
error
under
the
chapman
test.
the
failure
of
that
court
to
do
so,
the
unreasonable
decision-making
of
that
court,
relegated
mr.
fry
to
seeking
relief
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
it
scarcely
seems
reasonable--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--he
could
have,
your
honor,
however,
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
counsel
to
come
following
his
appeal
to
the
state
appellate
court,
and
then
after
the
denial
of
his
petition,
it
would
be
a
discretionary
review
in
the
california
supreme
court,
he
no
longer
had
the
right
to
counsel.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
he
had
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
following
that,
it
would
have
effectively
been
asking
at
that
stage
for
a
type
of
error
correction.
it
scarcely
seems
logical
that
the
scope
of
the
remedy
to
which
mr.
fry
is
entitled
for
the
constitutional
violation
that
he
suffered,
that
that
should
be
curtailed
based
upon
simply
the
unreasonable
decision-making
of
the
state
appellate
court
in
the--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--justice
scalia,
that's
the
point
raised
in
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
brief
here.
and
in
mr.
fry's
case,
what
happened
was
that
there
was
a
harmless
error
analysis
conducted,
albeit
truncated,
by
the
state
appellate
court.
but
it
was
not
a
chapman
analysis.
and
that
failure
of
the
state
appellate
court
to
engage
in
a
chapman
analysis
is
contrary
to
this
court's
precedent.
it
ignores
chapman,
it
also
would
be
an
attack
on--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--i
don't
know
that
necessarily
there
has
to
be
one
standard
of
review
for
the
other...
for
one
or
the
other,
your
honor.
our
position
in
this
case
is
simply
following
the
logic
of
this
court's
decision
in
mitchell
versus
esparza,
that
this
court
or
any
federal
habeas
court
needs
to
consider
what
the
state
appellate
court
did.
you
cannot
divorce...
there
is
the
underlying
constitutional
violation
that
occurred
in
mr.
fry's
trial.
then
that
error
is
compounded
when
a
state
appellate
court
fails
to
assess
the
effect
of
that
error
under
the
chapman
standard.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
well--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--that's
correct.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
that's
correct.
that's
in
pages
94
to
97
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
state
appellate
court
concluded
there
was
no
error
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
this
case.
the
court
also
concluded
that
there
was
no
constitutional
error.
then
in
a
footnote,
footnote
17
on
page
97
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
state
appellate
court
stated
in
the
alternative,
effectively,
there
was
no
prejudice
that
mr.
fry
possibly
could
have
suffered
in
this
case.
however,
in
making
that
alternative
holding,
the
state
appellate
court,
the
california
court,
was
applying
what's
known
as
the
watson
standard,
which
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
kotteakos
type
standard.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
i
am,
your
honor.
obviously,
we
are
objecting
to
the
state
court's
finding
of
no
underlying
substantive
constitutional
violation,
as
well
as
the
state
court's
determination
that
there
was
no--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--well,
first
of
all,
this
case,
since
it
has
now
been
determined
in
the
federal
courts
that
there
was
an
underlying
constitutional
violation,
does
not
present
that
question.
we
do...
and
i
understand
the
position
that
you
are
raising,
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
a
potential
split
in
the
logic
there.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
resolve
that
here.
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts
have
determined
that
now,
in
light
of
aedpa,
the
brecht
standard
has
been
completely
supplanted.
some
courts
have
construed
this
court's
decision
in
mitchell
versus
is
esparza
to
lead
to
that
conclusion.
and
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
however,
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
ultimately
address
that
proposition
in
this
case.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
collateral
review,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
brecht,
can
result
in
a
more
deferential
standard
of
harmless
error
inquiry.
the...
those
considerations
that
led
this
court
in
brecht
to
adopt
kotteakos
rather
than
chapman
apply
across-the-board
in
all
habeas
cases.
however,
a
central
theme
of
the
brecht
decision
was
that
there
have
been
chapman
analysis
conducted
by
the
state
appellate
judiciary--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--i
agree
that
it
could
be...
it
is
a
debatable
point.
but
the...
to
ignore
the
circumstance
that
this
court
stressed,
i
think
undoubtedly
stressed
in
brecht
that
there
had
been
that
state
appellate
review
is
to
basically
divorce
the
holding
in
brecht
from
the
factual
context
in
which
that
case...
or
out
of
which
that
case
arose.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
the
dissenters
thought
that
the
import
of
brecht
was
that
it
was
going
to
apply
across-the-board
in
federal
habeas--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--well,
i
suppose,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
state
appellate
court
didn't
simply
state,
we
find
no
error,
and
leave
it
at
that,
but
rather,
the
state
appellate
court
also
raised
the
point
that,
in
a
footnote,
in
a
truncated
manner,
that
there
is
no
possible--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--yes.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
it's
footnote
17.
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
it's
97
in
the
joint
appendix,--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
it's
angels
on
the
pin
of
a
needle,
i
guess
is
the
phrase
here,
and
this
case
may
be
a
case
where
the
difference
between
chapman
and
brecht
could
be
of
consequence.
if
you'd
look
at
the
district
court's
treatment
of
this
case,
at
the
district
court
level
the
court
stated:
"mr.
fry
comes
close
to
demonstrating
actionable
error.
"
and
that
court
is
applying
the
brecht
standard.
the
district
court
states:
"i
cannot
rule
out
prejudice
in
this
case.
"
so
seemingly
had
that
court
applied
chapman,
mr.
fry
would
have
prevailed
in
the
district
court.
likewise,
in
the
ninth
circuit
we
have
the
dissenting
justice
concluding
that
there
is
prejudice
even
under
the
brecht
standard,
and
then
we
have
the
panel
majority
in
ruling
against
mr.
fry
on
the
prejudice
issue
stating
that
had
pamela
maples'
testimony
been
admitted
that
would
have
substantially
bolstered
mr.
fry's
claim
of
innocence.
that
statement
seems
inconsistent
with
the
finding
that
it
is
harmless
error
under
brecht;
and
even
if
it's
not
inconsistent
it
seems
that
had
that
court
been
applying
the
chapman
standard,
that
court
would
have
ruled
in
mr.
fry's--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
well,
the
respondent
has
essentially
conceded
that
under
o'neal
that
they
bear
the
risk
of
non-persuasion.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
i
think
that
that
was
what
the
holding
in
the
majority
opinion
was,
but
i
think,
as
justice
thomas
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
the
effect
of
that
is
to
allocate
the
risk
of
non-persuasion
to
the
state.
and
so
i
think
that
that's...
i
could
be
wrong,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
semantic
point.
and
to
justice
stevens'
question,
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
concurrence
in
brecht,
the
kotteakos
standard
which
this
court
adopted
in
brecht
is
an
exacting
standard.
and
in
applying
that
standard,
if
you'd
look
at
this
case,
the
court's
decisions,
sullivan,
kotteakos,
say
that
the
focus
has
to
be
on
the
jury.
here
we
have
a
jury
in
the
third
trial
that
deliberated
for
23
court
days
after
29
court
days--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
well,
i
believe,
number
one,
does
it
matter
which
standard
applies
as
part
of
the
question
presented?
does
it
matter
which
harmless
error
standard
is
employed?
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
mr.
fry
prevails
under
either
brecht
or
chapman.
and
this
court
could
in
this
case
simply
decide
this
case
on
that
very
narrow
question,
like
many
court
do
where
this
issue
is
raised,
this
intellectually
challenging
issue
of
what
should
a
habeas
court
apply,
brecht
or
chapman,
when
there
has
been
no
chapman
analysis
in
the
state
court
or
when
there
has
been
an
objectively
unreasonable
chapman
analysis
in
the
state
court.
most
courts
confronted
with
that
issue
say,
we
don't
need
to
decide
the
question
here
because
either
the
error
was
plainly
harmless
under
both
of
those
standards
or
plainly
not
harmless
under
both
of
these
standards.
and
i
simply
recounted
the
history
of
the
litigation
below
in
the
federal
courts
to
point
out
that
this
could
be
a
case
where
that
makes
a
difference.
it
seems
like--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
i
think
that
that
is
the
import
of
that
portion
of
the
question.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
perhaps
not
if
that
was
the
only
question
in
and
of
itself,
but
perhaps
so
because,
as
i
indicated
before,
as
justice
stevens
stressed
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
brecht,
the
kotteakos
standard
is
a
demanding
standard.
and
look
at
this
case.
if
the
error
in
this
case
can
be
deemed
harmless
under
any
standard,
then
what
cannot?
what
is
prejudice
when
you're
looking
at
the
jury
and
when
you
have
a
jury
where
nine
days
into
the
deliberations
at
least
five
of
them
voted
that
mr.
fry
was
not
guilty.
they
told
the
judge
that
they
were
at
an
impasse.
this
jury
struggled
mightily
with
this
evidence.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
it
is
not,
and
it
seems
as
though,
looking
at
the
language
that
the
magistrate
judge
utilized
in
his
findings
and
recommendations,
that
he
was
looking
to
me,
to
mr.
fry,
to
meet
that
burden.
and
i
quoted
his
language
in
my
brief
and
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
had
been
improperly
allocated
to
mr.
fry.
however,
that
issue
was
simply
not
addressed
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
yes,
respondent
concedes
that
their
burden...
that
it's
their
burden--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
your
point,
as
i
understood
it,
in
o'neal
was
that
it
analytically
does
not
make
sense--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--when
the
appellate
court
is--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--i
think
that
that's
a
question,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
struggled
with.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dominguez
benitez,
that
we're
talking
about
with
these
harmless
error
standards
ineffable
gradations
of
probability
that
are
beyond
even
the
judicial
mind
to
grasp.
but
i
think
if
we
just
tie
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
that
in
the
explanation
you
just
gave
that
there
is
no
reasonable
judge
who
could
look
at
this
case
and
conclude--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--with
respect
to
a
standard
sufficiency
analysis,
no,
justice
alito.
it's
just
a
question
for
the
appellate
judge
to
discern,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
reviewing
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
i
agree.
and
i
don't
quarrel
at
all
with
the
way
that
the
court
described...
said
that
looking
at
the
prejudice
inquiry
or
a
harmless
error
inquiry
in
the
o'neal
case,
that
it
doesn't
fit
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
allocation
of
burden.
i
don't
think
that
this
case
ultimately
turns
on
that,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
magistrate
judge
when
he
wrote
his
finding
and
recommendations
that
were
adopted
by
the
district
court
judge
did
state
that
he
was
looking
to
mr.
fry
to
make
the
sufficient
showing--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--yes.
that's
exactly
what
i'm
relying
on,
your
honor.
so,
going
back
to
specifically
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
court
could,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
without
regard
to
the
thorny
chapman
versus
brecht
question,
decide
this
case
solely
in
terms
of,
under
brecht,
does
mr.
fry
prevail;
and
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
violation
that
occurred.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
no,
it
certainly
would
not,
your
honor.
and
this
court
may
very
well
deem
that
to
be
necessary.
but
i
think
also
that
this
court
fashioning
a
decision
which
is
faithful
to
the
requirement
that...
or
the
principle
that
kotteakos
is
an
exacting
standard,
would
also
be
an
important
constitutional
principle.
in
a
case
like
this,
where
there
has
been
no
chapman
review
and
where
the
chapman
court
stated
that
we
need
a
rigorous
harmless
error
standard
in
order
to
safeguard
convictions,
safeguard
against
erroneous
convictions
where
there
is
a
close
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
that
hasn't
happened
in
this
case
and
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
fashion
a
rule
or
holding
in
this
case
that
would
ensure
that
that
happens.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
as
i
understand
that
question,
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
the
introduction
of
its
amicus
brief
that
there
are
some
2255
cases
where
there's
been
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
which
could
involve
this
question
of
brecht
versus
chapman.
and
i've
cited
in
my
brief
a
district
court
case,
united
states
versus
monsanto,
where
the
court
concluded,
in
accordance
with
the
position
that
i'm
advocating,
that
it
makes
no
sense
for
a
reviewing
court
in
a
habeas
proceeding
to
apply
the
brecht
standard
blindly
without
regard
to
what
was
done
in
prior
proceedings,
but
rather
there's
no
need
for
deference,
where
the...
the
big
issue
in
brecht,
as
i
understand
it,
was
this
court
was
concerned
about
simply
repeating
a
harmless
error
analysis
that
the
state
court
had
already
done;
and
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
do
that
in
this
case.
the
same
concern,
justice
ginsburg,
holds
over
in
certain
limited
2255
cases.
if
i
may
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
thank
you.
the
trial
counsel--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--i
think
that
possibly
the
foundation
with
hurtz
there
could
be
increased.
the
jury
sought
mr.
hurtz.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
well,
i
was
just
thinking
that
his
presence
there
would
be
relevant.
the
jury
actually
saw
him.
they
heard
a
truck
driver
describing,
a
neutral
truck
driver,
describing
the
actual
killer,
who
in
no
way
fit
the
description
of
mr.
fry.
unfortunately,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
what
mr.
hurtz
looked
like,
but
the
jury
saw
it.
and
if
the
jury
saw
that
that
truck
driver
was
describing
a
man
that
looked
like
mr.
hurtz,
then
that--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--there
were
infirmities
in
his
testimony,
your
honor.
however,
he
came
from
missouri,
so
maybe
he
was
looking
at
a
missouri
clock.
we
don't
know.
but
why
would
that
man
make
up
a
story?
he
has
no
axe
to
grind
in
this
case.
and
then
his
testimony
is
corroborated
by
a
gentleman
who
sees
him
immediately
after
it
and
says:
he
looked
like
he
had
just
seen
a
ghost,
and
described
seeing
a
double
execution-style
murder.
now--
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
--that
was
all
presented
to
the
jury.
however,
ms.
maples'
testimony
was
not,
and
counsel
did
not
argue
that
heavily
focused
on
mr.
hurtz'
guilt.
she
certainly
did
argue
it,
but
the
reason
that
she
didn't
is
because,
as
the
court
of
appeals,
the
california
court
of
appeals,
said,
the
other
seven
witnesses
who
said
mr.
hurtz
said
he
had
killed
the
bells
were
all
described
as
having
been
flimsy
witness
who
gave
contradictory
unbelievable
testimony.
mr.
victor
s.
haltom
mr.
chief
justice,
she
was
extremely
strong.

in
the
joint
appendix,
respondent
concedes
she
was
the
only
unbiased
witness
concerning
mr.
hurtz's...
concerning
mr.
hurtz.
she
heard
this,
her
cousin,
saying
he
shot
a
man
and
a
woman
in
a
parked
car,
first
shooting
the
woman
in
the
head,
then
shooting
the
man,
getting
blood
all
over
himself.
that
linked
up
with
all
the
other
confessions
in
this
case.
interlinking
confessions
just
like
in
chambers
were
deemed
to
provide
adequate
assurance
of
reliability.
