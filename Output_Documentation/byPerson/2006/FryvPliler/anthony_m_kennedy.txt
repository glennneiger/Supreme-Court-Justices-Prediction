justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
he
could
have
come
here
on
direct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
that
if
the
brecht
standard
applies,
does
the
petitioner
or
the
state
bear
the
burden?
i
guess
that's
the
narrower
question,
who
has
the
burden.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
maybe,
maybe
you'd
end
up--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
third
party
perpetrator
that
maples
was
going
to
talk
about
according
to
the
prosecution's
theory,
was
hurtz
or
hearst?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there...
there
was
a
link
between
hurtz,
there
was
an
acquaintanceship
between
hurtz
and
the
victim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
established
in
other
testimony
or
would
that
all
have
come
out
just
only
through
maples?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
did
hurtz's
name
enter
into
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
did
anybody
mention
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
say
he'd
killed
peoples
otherwise,
or
at
other
times?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
at
that
point
in
time,
maples,
maples'
conviction...
maples'
testimony
becomes,
assuming
there's
a
foundation,
becomes
more
relevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
haltom,
before
you
go
drifting,
counsel,
into
the
evidentiary
questions
in
the
case,
i
have
one
question.
two
cases.
a,
hurtz
did
not
testify
at
all.
b,
he
did.
is
the
foundation
ruling
any
different
in
the
two
cases
insofar
as
maples'
testimony
or
is
it
the
same?
i.e.,
is
there
a
lesser
showing
for
foundation
if
hurtz
did
testify?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
you
mean,
oh,
you
mean
more?
you
have
to
be
more
strict
for
foundation
after
hurtz
testified?
i
was
suggesting
the
opposite.
