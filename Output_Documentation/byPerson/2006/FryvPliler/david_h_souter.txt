justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
just
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
for
a
second?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
mean,
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
a
very
good
answer
as
a,
as
sort
of
a
general
statement.
but
in...
would
you
agree
that
in
this
case,
if
we...
if
we
do
proceed,
number
one,
to
agree
with
you
that
brecht
is
the
standard,
and
we
then
do
proceed
to
apply
brecht
here
or
to
determine
whether
brecht
was
properly
applied
here,
that
in
this
particular
case,
the,
the
record
indicates
that
the
case
was
so
close
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
finding
of
harmful
error,
or
at
least
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
harmless
error.
even
applying
brecht
here.
and
you
know
what
i'm
getting
at.
i
mean,
five
weeks
of
deliberation.
the
question
after,
whatever
it
was,
two
weeks,
and
four
ballots,
and
so
on.
obviously
this...
this
case
was
just
to
tottering
on
the
edge.
so
even
if
we,
if
we
do
get
to
the
point
of
applying
brecht,
wouldn't
it
be
impossible
to
say
that
he's...
he
gets
no
relief
under
brecht?
justice
david
h.
souter
five,
five
weeks?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
in
which
the
jury
deliberated
for
five
weeks?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sure
there's
an
example
somewhere,
but
i...
i
practiced
law
for
over
40
years,
and
i
never
heard
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
otherwise,
i
mean,
they
couldn't
have
found
it
was
cumulative
if...
if
that
had
not
been
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
on
appellate
review
in
california,
they
found
it
cumulative,
didn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they...
they
couldn't
have
found
that
if
there
hadn't
been
some
evidence
on
hurtz,
apart
from
maples?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
maples'
testimony
had
come
in,
i
presume
they
could
have
cross-examined
him
on
the
basis
of
maples'
testimony?
justice
david
h.
souter
neither
am
i.
but
i
draw
a
different
conclusion
from
it
from
the
one
you're
drawing.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
cannot
accept
the
state...
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
possible
prejudice,
on
the
premises
that
justice
stevens
a
moment
ago
and
i
a
moment
before
sort
of
put
out.
i
just
do
not
find
that
a
reasonable
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
they
may
have
been
doing
that
is
that
they
may
very
well
have
thought
that
the
evidence
indicating
third
party
guilt
was
close
and
perhaps
persuasive
and
what
they
wanted
to
know
was
whether
the
evidence
going
specifically
to
this
defendant
was
strong
enough
to
overcome
it.
