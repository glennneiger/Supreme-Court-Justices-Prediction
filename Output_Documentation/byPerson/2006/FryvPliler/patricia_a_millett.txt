ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
distinction
between
collateral
review
and
direct
review
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
law,
and
what
petitioner
is
asking
is
to
have
the
standard
of
review
for
harmlessness
in
collateral
review
become
the
same
standard
as
direct
review
whenever
the
courts
on
direct
review
got
chapman
wrong
or
unreasonably
applied
it.
that
is
the
exact
same
argument
mr.
brecht
made
in
this
court.
he
got
chapman
review.
they
cited
chapman.
they
didn't
cite
it
here.
that's
the
only
difference.
mr.
brecht
came
to
this
court
and
said
they
unreasonably
applied
chapman
review
and
i
should
get
it
again
on
habeas,
and
this
court
said
that
there
is
a
deep
difference,
a
deep
distinction,
between
collateral
review
and
direct
review
and
that
distinction
turns
upon
the
fundamental
rule
of
habeas
corpus,
and
that
is
not
to
sit
here
as
the
sixth
court
on
direct
review
of
a
long
record
where
difficult
calls
were
made.
it
is
to
correct
fundamental
miscarriages
of
justice,
grievous
wrongs
that
have
caused
custody
in
violation
of
constitutional--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
i
can
adopt
justice
breyer's
language
from
o'neal
and
say
that
this
court
eschewed
couching
this
discussion
in
terms
of
burden
of
persuasion.
we
accept
o'neal's
holding
what
then
there
is
equipoise,
which
did
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
tie
goes
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
tie
would
go
to
the
prisoner,
yes.
were
it
in
equipoise,
because
the
state
would
have
the
burden
the
state
would
lose.
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
i
think
what
justice
breyer,
what
this
court
said
o'neal
said
is,
the
way
you
articulated
it,
instead
of
burden
of
proof
is
that
it's
a
level
of
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
court
and
what
the
judge
will
say
in,
what
the
court
said
in
o'neal,
is,
do
i
think
the
error
substantially
contributed
to
the
jury's
verdict?
and
that
is
essentially
what
the
court
said
here
on
181
at
the
very
bottom
when
it
said
"the
court
doesn't
find
that
there's
an
insufficient
showing.
"
--that's
the
same
way
of
saying
i
haven't
been
persuaded...
that
the
error
contributed
to
the
verdict.
so
i
don't
think
that
this
case
in
any
sense
could
turn
upon,
whether
we
call
it
the
burden
of
persuasion
or
the
proper
level
of
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
court.
this
court
was
not
persuaded
and
that
is
all
that
matters.
when
the
court
is
not
persuaded
and
not
left
in
equipoise,
the
prisoner
loses.
the
second
question
you
asked
was
whether
we
have
a
position
on
application
of
brecht,
and
we
do.
we've
laid
it
out
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
in
no
sense
does
this
record
support
the
notion,
support
the
argument,
that
there
was
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
when
the
twelfth
out
of
eleven
witnesses
was
excluded,
talking
about
third
party
culpability.
and
that
requires
not
just
looking
at
what,
in
isolation,
what
evidence
was
in
there
about
mr.
hurtz.
there
was
i
think
six
or
seven
witnesses
who
said
they
heard
him
either
say
he
did
it
or
he
was
there
or
he
was
involved.
but
it
requires
looking
at
the
whole
record.
and
there
were...
the
defense
here
was
not
a
hurtz
versus
fry.
this
was
a
case
where
the
defense
did
an
excellent
job.
it
was
a
well
defended
case,
and
threw
up
a
buffet
of
options
for
the
jury,
none
of
which
it
bought
on.
in
the
third
trial
you
had
what
you
didn't
had
in
the
prior
trials.
you
had
ballistics
evidence
that
linked
his
gun
to
the
crime.
you
have
his
own
admission,
his
own
testimony,
that
he
left
the
house
that
night
with
the
gun,
with
the
bullets,
and
went
out
in
the
truck
that
was
seen
at...
a
truck
of
the
same
type,
that
was
seen
at
the
crime
scene.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
two
answers.
if
it's
a
close
question,
if
aedpa
and
if
kotteakos
and
brecht
mean
anything,
it's
that
the
close
calls
go
to
the
state
and
are
not
overturned
by
the
sixth
court
on
review.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
is,
and
no
one
has
thought
this
was
equal.
the
two
courts...
the
three
courts,
the
california
court
of
appeals
also
said
in
any
event
there's
no
possible
prejudice.
now,
how
they
could
say
no
possible
prejudice
under
a
state
standard
and
still
say,
ah,
but
it
would
have
affected
the
verdict
under
chapman,
is
not
something
i'm
able
to
understand.
so
i
think
you
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
guess
i
misunderstand
your
point,
because
i
think
when
the
court
said
there's
no
possible
prejudice--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
again,
even
if
the
court
thinks
there
may
have
been
some
chance,
may
have
been...
you
know...
relevant
testimony...
this
court
can
well
disagree
and
can
conclude
that
this
was
abuse
of
discretion.
if
it
were
federal
rule
of
evidence
403,
you
could
decide
this
was
a
an
abuse
of
discretion.
whether
it
was
unconstitutional,
so
clearly
unconstitutional
as
to
merit
under
aedpa
and
under
brecht
reversal
of
the
conviction
12
years
after
the
fact--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--again,
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
not
conceded
constitutional
error,
and
in
their
brief
they
repeat
that.
and
i
think
there's
a
question
whether
a
court
should--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
a
respondent
is
entitled
to
defend
on
any
ground
supported
by
the
record.
but
even
assuming
that,
we'll
assume
the
error,
assumes
that
there
was
an
error
and
one
assumes
that
it
was...
which
is
hard
for
me
to
get
to,
but
one
assumes
it
was
clearly
unconstitutional
in
this
close
call,
the
type
of
call
that's
made
hundreds
of
times
in
every
trial,
balancing
this,
and
the
combination
of
lack
of
foundation
and
cumulativeness.
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
when
that
rises
to
the
level
of
unconstitutionality.
but
if
we
assume
that
it
did,
you
have
the
two
courts
that
applied
the
brecht
standard
here.
and
the
district
court
decision
here
is
nearly
100
pages
long.
it's
a
very
careful,
methodical
analysis.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there's
many
issues,
but
also
it
was
being
careful
and
it
was
being
very
methodical.
and
it
went
through
this
and
it
went
through
this
record.
that
court
went
through
true
this
record,
more
than
5,000
transcript
pages,
11
weeks
of
trial,
more
than
100
witnesses.
and
it
was
on
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
that's
what
this
court
has
said.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
get
back
to
is
the
question
about
the
length
of
jury
deliberations.
sure,
this
was
really
long.
now,
they
changed
forepersons
in
midstream
and
got
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
repeated.
who
knows
what
happened.
but
what
i
will
not
concede...
i
will
concede
it's
long,
but
i
will
not
concede
that
the
mere
fact
of
length
of
deliberations
says
anything
about
if
this
one
particular
error
in
applying
a
balancing
test
substantially
affected
the
verdict.
i
think
the
length
of
deliberations
is
so
incredibly
speculative.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
will
concede
it
was,
i
will
concede
it
was
a
difficult
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
right.
but
you
know,
the
whole
the
point
of
federal
habeas
corpus
is
that
this
is
not
filling
in
the
gaps
in
direct
review.
we're
not
going
to
give
you--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
exactly
right.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
closing
arguments,
mr.
hurtz
has
a
couple
of
references
in
a
two-day
closing
argument.
that
was
not
the
centerpiece
of
his
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
but
as
to
who
did
it
and
whether
hurtz
did
it
or
whether...
remember,
what
the
defense
is
trying
to
show
is
not
who
did
it;
it's
that
this
person
didn't
do
it,
and
whether
it
was
them
or
someone
else
is
what
we
don't
know.
again,
this
is
federal
habeas
corpus
before
this
court,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
misapplication
of
a
valid
rule
of
evidence,
which
is
not
what
this
court
has
in
chambers,
holmes,
or
any
of
the
cases
that
were
involved,
was
so...
that
simply
disallowed
the
twelfth
out
of
eleven
witnesses
on
third
party
culpability
is
so
clearly
erroneous,
it
was
so
clearly
impacting
the
verdict
in
this
case,
as
to
warrant
a
retrial
15
years
after
the
crime.
and
yes,
the
jury...
it
was
close
in
the
sense
that
they
worked
a
long
hard
time.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
they
were
unanimous.
there's
nothing
close
about
unanimous.
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
wrong
message
to
say
that
a
jury
that
works
as
hard
as
this
one
did,
did
the
readbacks,
culled
through
this
record--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--one
never
knows
that
in
habeas
corpus.
but
what
you
do
when
you
look
at
what
they
were
focusing
on,
they
were
focusing
on
the
two
ballistics
experts.
they
had
them
read
back
right
next
each
other.
they
made
that
call.
it's
their
job
to
do
it.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
may
i
answer?
one
would
have
expected
at
least
one
readback
on
third
party
culpability
instead
of
three
readbacks
of
mr.
fry's
testimony
which
put
himself
that
night
with
the
gun
in
the
truck,
and
which
he
said...
you
know...
and
beforehand
he
agreed
he
might
have
said
he
wanted
to
blow
them
away.
thank
you.
