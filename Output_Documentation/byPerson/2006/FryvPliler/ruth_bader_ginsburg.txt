i
thought
the
state
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
error.
i
thought
the
state
court
said,
this
was
cumulative,
i'm
not
going
to
let
it
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
until
we
got
into
the
federal
court
that
there
was
an
error
determined.
as
far
as
the
state
was
concerned,
there
was
no
reason
to
engage
in
any
kind
of
harmless
error
review,
chapman
or
brecht,
because
there
was
no
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
question
on
which
we
would
be
likely
to
grant
cert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
talking
about
what's
on
the
bottom
of
page
181
of
the
joint
appendix?
that
was
the
only
place
that
i
found
where
the
magistrate
expressed
a
view
on
this.
it
reads:
"the
court
does
not
find
that
there
has
been...
the
court
does
find
that
there
has
been
an
insufficient
showing.
"
so
that
"insufficient
showing"
means
"showing
by
the
petitioner".
is
that
what
you're
relying
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
put
2254
out
of
sync
with
2255,
where
i
understand
if
it's
a
federal
conviction
then
it's
always
brecht
on
post-conviction
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
remedy,
if
the
petitioner
wants
to
assure
he's
going
to
get
chapman
review
someplace,
then
he
should
have
sought
cert...
direct
review
from
the
state
court's
conviction.
did
you
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
realistically,
the
likelihood
that
such
a
petition
would
be
successful,
passing
the
problem
that
the
petitioner
is
not
likely
to
have
a
lawyer,
does
the
likelihood
that
this
court
would
grant
cert
on
such
a
question
is
very
slim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
two
to
one
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
rawlinson
i
think
said
that
using
the
brecht
standard,
that
there
was
actual
prejudice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point,
how
many
weeks
had
gone
by
when
they
said
they
were
hung?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
the
other
side,
state
courts
say,
we
don't
have,
we
don't
have
to
bother
in
any
case
with
chapman
because
when
it
goes
over
into
the
federal
court
they're
going
to
apply
brecht.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
aedpa
question
was
out
of
it
because
that
hasn't
been...
there
was
no
cross-appeal
on
that
question.
i
thought
it
was
a
given,
a
given
in
this
case,
that
the
california
courts
did
not
apply
or
unreasonably
applied
clearly
established
federal
law.
i
didn't
think
that
was
an
issue
in
the
case.
i
think
we
took
it
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
such
an
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
raised
here.
there
was
no
cross-appeal
from
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
because
there
were
many,
many
issues
raised.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
were
all
kinds
of
infirmities
in
that
truck
driver's
testimony,
including
the
time,
the
timing
of
the
murder.
