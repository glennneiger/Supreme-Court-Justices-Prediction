justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
could
come
back
to,
may
i
ask
this
question:
is
part
of
your
argument
that
even
under
the
brecht
standard
it
was
not
harmless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
case,
am
i
correct,
where
there
were
two,
two
hung
juries
and
then
a
five-week
deliberation
in
this
case?
and
there
was
a
harmless...
and
the
testimony
of
maples
was
she
had
seen
a
guy
who
didn't
fit
the
description
do
the
killing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
with
one
thing
i'm
not
terribly
clear
about,
though.
is
it
clear
which...
what
side
the
magistrate
thought
had
the
burden
of
persuasion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
opponent
now
concede
that
the
state
had
the
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
two
or
three
of
those
did
it
on
an
improper
ground,
that
you
agree
with
now,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
purposes
of
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
this
the...
i
may
have
it
wrong...
but
isn't
this
the
case
in
which
the
witness
was
unique
not
cumulative
because
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
completely
disinterested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
ask
for
a
read
back
of
mrs.
maples'
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
right.
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
a
critical
witness
was
left
out.
that
argues
the
other
way,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
classic
going
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
that
goes
to
the
weight,
not
the
admissibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
assume
that
he's
committed
a
whole
lot
of
killings,
i
don't
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
questions
and
then
you
can
proceed.
one,
do
you
take
a
position
on
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion?
that's
the
first
question.
and
do
you
have
an
opinion
on
proper
application
of
brecht
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
if
it
were
in
equipoise
the
state
would
have
the
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
same
problem
justice
souter
does,
in
all
candor.
the
jury
takes
five
weeks
to
decide
the
case
and
there's
a
fairly
interesting
bit
of
testimony
that
doesn't
get
in.
and
to
say
to
be
totally
satisfied
it
didn't
have
an
injurious
effect
on
the
deliberations
is
a
close
question,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
an
equally
divided
call
goes
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
not
just
a
close
call,
but
if
it's
equal,
it
goes
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
will
concede
it
was
a
close
case,
won't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
take
five
weeks
it's
pretty
clearly
a
close
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
close
on
an
alternative
murderer.
it
wasn't
suicide.
obviously,
if
he
didn't
do
it,
somebody
else
did.
so
if
it's
a
close
case
from
the
first,
it's
obviously
a
close
case
for
the
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we
don't
know
what
they
would
have
done
if
they
had
this
evidence
that
was
excluded.
that's
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
all
presented
to
the
jury,
right?
