justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
think
the
majority
said
the
contrary.
i
mean,
i
wrote
it.
i
mean,
i
don't
know...
what
counts
is
what
i
wrote,
not
what
i
thought.
but
if
you
read
it,
i
don't
think
it
decides
this
question.
what
i
wonder,
though,
is
why
does
the...
how
does
this
case
present
the
issue
you
want
to
argue?
i'm...
justice
ginsburg
made
me
wonder
about
that.
as
i
understand
it,
the
trial
court
said,
i'm
not
going
to
let
this
witness
testify,
it
is
cumulative.
all
right.
and
then
the
appeals
court
said,
well,
that
wasn't
a
mistake.
and
one
reason
it
wasn't
a
mistake
is
that
this
witness
added
nothing.
there
could
be
no
possible
prejudice,
says
the
trial
court,
when
he
excluded
that
person.
that
means
it
was
cumulative,
that
means
it
did
nothing,
and
that
was
the
appeals
court.
so
the
appeals
court
finds
no
error.
now,
we
get
over
to
the
federal
court.
and
they
say,
oh,
no,
this
witness
added
a
lot.
well,
they
couldn't
have
thought
this
witness
added
a
lot
to
the
point
where
the
constitution
is
violated
unless
they
disagreed
with
that
decision
of
making
no
possible
difference.
very
well.
we
disagree,
send
it
back.
end
of
case.
now,
where
does
it
raise
all
this
stuff
about
harmless
error
and...
i
mean,
when
i...
it
is
hard
for
me
to
get
my
mind
around
this
issue,
because
it's
so
complicated.
how
does
this
case
raise
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
that
as
a
reason
for
there
not
being
error?
or
was
it
in
the
context
of
saying,
well,
even
if
there
was
a
mistake,
there
was
no
possible
prejudice.
what
does
the
footnote
mean,
in
your
opinion?
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
footnote
number?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i'll
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
very
helpful.
the
other
thing
which
i
brought
up,
so
i
might
as
well
get
both
my
questions
out,
is
that
years
ago
i
read
a
decision
by
judge
leventhal
that
made
a
big
impression
on
me.
and
he
was
a
very
good
judge.
it's
in
a
different
context,
it's
the
same
problem.
he
said,
i
originally
thought
this
was
the
case
dreamed
of
by
law
professors,
a
case
where
i
could
conscientiously
say,
although
i
consider
the
findings
clearly
erroneous,
so
i'd
reverse
if
it
were
a
judge's
decision,
nonetheless,
there
is
support
and
substantial
evidence.
and
therefore,
i
affirm
it,
because
it
comes
from
an
agency.
but
when
i
think
about
it,
i
don't
think
there's
substantial
evidence
either.
okay.
in
other
words,
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
the
history
of
mankind
where
you
think
a
judge
has
actually
thought
to
himself,
after
reviewing
the
record,
oh,
i
think
that
this
is
harmless,
so
i'll
affirm.
but
i
don't
think
it's
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
i'll
reverse.
i
mean,
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
myself
in
that
state
of
mind,
where
i
think
such
a
thing
is
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
o'neal,
i
thought
o'neal
just
says
that
this
word
"burden
of
proof"
is
out
of
place
when
you
talk
about
an
appellate
judge
reading
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
they
say
that
after
i
thought
i
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court
which
said
this
concept
is
not
applicable
in...
when
you're
reviewing
a
record
for
harmless
error.
it's
not
a
question
of
presenting
evidence.
what
i
think
it
said
is
that
it's
not
a
question
of
presentation
of
evidence.
in
such
a
case,
we
think
it's
conceptually
clear
for
the
judge
to
ask
directly,
do
i
the
judge
think
that
the
error
substantially
influenced
the
judge's...
the
jury's
decision?
now,
maybe
i
was
wrong,
but
i
think
there
was
a
majority
of
the
court
that
agreed
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
talk
about
burdens
of
proof?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
that's
my
basic
question
in
this
case
and
it's
a
serious
question.
suppose
i
think,
which
i
do
think,
that
i
as
a
judge
can
conscientiously
review
a
record
and
decide
for
myself
whether
i
think
this
error
of
the
judge
was
harmless,
and
if
i
really
try
i
can
bring
myself
to
understand
this
question.
regardless
of
what
i
think,
could
another
judge,
say
a
state
judge,
reasonably
have
thought
the
opposite?
i
can
do
that
mentally.
you
try
to
get
me
to
make
more
fine
distinctions
than
that,
i
cannot
do
it.
i
can't.
i'm
sorry.
i
admit
it.
now,
if
that's
the
state
of
mind
that
i
can
get
myself
into...
and
i
believe
that's
true
of
many
judges...
how
do
i
write
words
that
are
realistic
in
this
area?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
apply
brecht.
this
is
what
i'm
having
to
little
trouble
with
but
i'd
appreciate
your
commenting
or
straightening
this
out.
the
ninth
circuit
holds
two
things
according
to
the
sg
in
the
briefs.
he
states
them
very
well.
the
first
is
let's
look
at
this
witness.
the
testimony
was
excluded.
now
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
exclusion
was
unreasonable
of...
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law,
because
that
testimony
of
the
witness
that
was
excluded
was
not
only
material,
it
would
have
substantially
bolstered
the
claim
of
innocence.
so
that's
their
finding
on
the
merits.
then
they
go
on
to
say,
but
the
exclusion
was
harmless.
how
could
both
those
things
be
true?
how
could
it
be
true
that
the
reason
that
there
was
error
in
excluding
it
was
that
the
evidence
is
so
important
that
it
substantially
bolsters
the
claim
of
innocence?
that's
one
thing
they
say.
but
the
exclusion
was
harmless.
i
just
fail
to
understand
how
anyone
could
think
both
those
things.
but
maybe
in
the
context
of
the
case
it
was
possible,
but
that's
what
i'd
appreciate
your
explaining.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
she
heard
was
that
they
were
going
to
kill,
this
other
person
was
going
to
kill
a
man
and
a
woman,
and
it
turned
out
that
that
was
the
crime
at
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
she
hear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think...
do
you
think,
do
you
think
i
should
do
this?
i'm
still
looking,
i'm
worried
about
on
the
one
hand,
as
you
are,
having
this
court
announce
too
many
six-part
tests,
and
having
a
lot
of
words
and
it
becomes
easy
to
make
a
mistake
for
a
judge
and
then
you
never
finish
a
proceeding.
i'm
worried
about
that,
as
are
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
same
time,
i
think
what
counts
is
what
the
judge
does,
the
reviewing
judge.
not
what...
quite
what
the
test
says.
so
there
has
to
be
a
conscientious
effort
to
decide,
was
there...
was
it
harmless?
could
a
reasonable
jurist
in
california
have
concluded
the
opposite?
okay.
so
maybe
we
should
do
it
in
this
case.
we
simply
try
ourselves
to
go
through
this
record,
make
that
determination
to
show
by
example,
rather
than
by
trying
to
find
a
form
of
words.
