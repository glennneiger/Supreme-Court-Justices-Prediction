justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
we're
talking
about
what...
where
is
the
logic
in
the
result
that
i
believe
you're
position
produces,
which
is
that
a
prisoner
who
loses
in
the
state
court
on
harmlessness
grounds,
because
the
state
court
finds
it's
harmless,
obtains
no
habeas
relief
in
federal
court
unless
the
error
actually
prejudiced
him.
whereas
if
the
state
court
never
reached
the
harmlessness
ground,
and
erred
on...
or
ruled
on
whether
the
violation
occurred,
whether
there
was
any
constitutional
violation,
then
he
would
obtain
relief
if
there
is
merely
a
reasonable
probability
of
harm.
now,
you
know,
why
would
there...
what
does
he
care
whether...
whether
the
error
below
consisted
in
an
erroneous
harmlessness
determination
or
an
erroneous
determination
that
there
was
no
violation?
why
should
there
be
a
different
standard
of
review
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
another
violation,
the
court
erroneously
determines...
erroneously...
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
at
all.
its
error
is
not
with
regard
to
the
harmlessness,
but
with
regard
to
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
why
should
there
be
one
standard
of
review
for
one
error
and
a
different
standard
of
review
for
the
other,
regardless
of
whether
the
state
court
conducted
chapman
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
when
the
state
court
has
erroneously
determined
that
there
was
no
violation.
in
that
case,
you
apply
the
kotteakos
standard.
i
just
don't
understand
the
rationale
of
applying
a
higher
standard
to
the
other
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
that
determination
that
you
are
objecting
to
here.
the
harmlessness
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
the
former,
you
are
perfectly
content
with
our
applying
kotteakos.
and
for
the
latter,
however,
you
say
we
have
to
apply
chapman.
i
just
don't
see
the
logic
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
dissenters
certainly
thought
that
that
was
the
consequence,
the
dissenters
in
brecht.
they
said
that
kotteakos
would
apply
even
where
the
state
court
has
found
that
"no
violation
has
occurred".
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
never
approached
the
harmlessness
thing.
that's
what
the
dissenters
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
with
reading
that
second
question
that
way
is
that,
you
know,
it
follows
from
your
first
question,
which
speaks
in
the
generality
of
cases.
it's
not
speaking
to
this
case.
your
first
question
presented
is,
if
constitutional
error
in
a
state
trial
is
not
recognized
by
the
judiciary
until
the
case
ends
up
in
federal
court,
is
the
prejudicial
impact
assessed
under
the
standard
set
forth
in
chapman
or
in
brecht?
that's
the
first
question.
very
generalized.
second
question:
does
it
matter
which
harmless-error
standard
is
employed?
i
didn't
take
that
to
mean
does
it
matter
in
this
case
which
of
the
two.
i
thought
it
meant,
you
know,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two
standards?
don't
you
think
that's
fair
reading
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
means,
does
it
matter
in
this
case
which
harmless...
you
think
that
second
sentence
means
would,
would
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
reversal
of
the
conviction
no
matter
which
harmless
error
standard
is
employed?
you
think
that's
what
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
of
all
the
questions
that
go
into
habeas
under
2254,
that
they
could
have
brought
up
directly
but
the
chances
are
their
being
taken
here
are
negligible?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case
is
not
much
more
fun.
it's
no.
06-5247,
fry
v.
pliler.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
again.
there
are
two
different
standards
that
this
court
has
required
for
determining
whether
a
procedural
error
in
a
criminal
trial
is
harmless.
one
is
the
so
called
chapman
standard,
deriving
its
name
from
our
decision
in
chapman
versus
california,
which
asks
whether
the
error
was
“harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.”
that
standard
is
applied
in
cases
that
are
on
direct
review.
the
other
standard
one
which
it
is
easier
for
the
state
to
meet
is
applied
on
habeas
corpus
review
of
convictions
that
are
already
final
called
the
brecht
standard
after
our
decision
in
brecht
versus
abrahamson.
it
asks
whether
the
error
had
“a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
jury’s
verdict.”
what
prompts
the
present
case
is
that
in
prior
applications
of
the
brecht
standard
on
habeas,
the
state
or
federal
court
has
already
applied
the
more
rigorous
chapman
standard
on
direct
review.
the
claim
by
petitioner
in
this
habeas
case
is
that
when
chapman
has
not
previously
been
applied
on
direct
review,
chapman
must
be
the
standard
on
habeas
review.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple;
the
trial
judge
presiding
over
petitioner’s
murder
trial
excluded
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
defense
witnesses.
after
being
convicted
petitioner
argued
on
appeal
that
that
exclusion
violated
due
process.
the
california
court
of
appeals,
did
not
explicitly
addressed
the
validity
of
the
due-process
claim
but
stated
without
specifying
which
standard
for
assessing
the
harmlessness
of
error
it
was
applying
that
“no
possible
prejudice”
could
have
resulted
from
exclusion
of
the
testimony
in
light
of
its
cumulative
nature.
the
state
supreme
court
denied
discretionary
review,
petitioner
then
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition,
raising
among
other
things
the
same
due-process
claim.
the
magistrate
judge
has
signed
to
the
case
founded
that
their
had
been
due-process
violation
and
disagreed
with
the
state
appellate
court’s
finding
of
no
possible
prejudice.
but
he
nevertheless
concluded
that
there
was
an
insufficient
showing
that
the
improper
exclusion
of
testimony
had
using
the
brecht
standard
a
substantial
and
injurious
affect
on
the
jury’s
verdict.
agreeing
with
the
magistrate
judge,
the
district
court
denied
relief
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
applied
brecht’s
substantial
and
injurious
affect
standard
for
assessing
harmlessness
even
though
the
state
appellate
court
had
not
recognized
the
alleged
constitutional
error
and
thus
had
not
reviewed
its
harmlessness
under
the
more
defendant
friendly
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
of
chapman.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
and
hold
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
applied
brecht,
rather
than
chapman.
brecht
applies
in
federal
habeas
cases
even
if
the
state
appellate
court
has
not
found
as
did
the
state
appellate
court
in
brecht
that
the
error
was
harmless
under
chapman.
this
conclusion
is
indicated
by
the
brecht
opinion
itself,
which
did
not
focus
on
whether
the
state
court
had
conducted
chapman
review
but
instead
cited
concerns
about
finality,
comity
and
federalism
as
the
primary
reasons
for
adopting
a
less
onerous
standard
on
collateral
review.
since
each
of
these
concerns
applies
with
equal
force
whether
or
not
the
state
court
has
reached
the
chapman
question,
it
would
be
illogical
to
make
the
standard
of
review
turn
upon
that
contingency.
we
do
not
consider
petitioner’s
argument
that
the
judgment
below
must
nevertheless
be
reversed
even
under
the
brecht
standard
because
that
issue
is
not
fairly
encompassed
by
the
question
presented
and
the
question
on
which
we
granted
review.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
joined
and
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
in
part.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
