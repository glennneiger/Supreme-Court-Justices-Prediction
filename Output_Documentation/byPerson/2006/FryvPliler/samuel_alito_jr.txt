there
are
many
situations
in
which
an
appellate
court
has
to
apply
a
legal
standard
to
facts
in
criminal
cases
and
civil
cases.
in
a
criminal
case,
an
issue
on
appeal
could
be
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict.
do
you
think
there's
a
burden
of
persuasion
on
appeal
on
all
of
those
issues?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
applying
any
harmless
error
standard?
it's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
analysis.
it's
a
different
legal
test,
but
you're
applying,
you're
applying
the
law
to
facts.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
necessary
for
us
to
try
to
reconcile
those
two
statements?
the
ninth
circuit
may
well
have
been
wrong
in
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
at
all,
but
we
have
to
assume
that,
for
purposes
of
the
question
that's
presented
to
us.
so
why
shouldn't
we
just
analyze
the
harmless
error
question
independently
of
what
they
said
about
whether
there
was
a
chambers
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
every
time
evidence
is
excluded
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
cumulative,
or
is
the
equivalent
of
a
403
balancing
in
federal
court,
there's
not
a
constitutional
error
under
chambers
and
related
cases,
is
there?
