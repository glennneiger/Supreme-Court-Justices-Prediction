justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
problem
with
this
is
that
there...
well,
some
doctors
absolutely
agree.
i
mean,
you
know,
my
list
over
here,
in
which
i
have
hundreds
of
references
from
this
thing,
is
doctor
after
doctor
who
takes
the
other
position,
and
they
say,
look,
all
that
we're
doing
here
is
trying
to
remove
the
fetus
in
a
single
pass.
the
fetus
is
going
to
die
anyway.
it's
not
viable.
we're
trying
to
remove
it
in
a
single
pass,
and
the
reason
we're
trying
to
do
that
is
if
we
don't,
there
may
be
bone
fragments
left
inside
the
womb.
there
may
be
fetal
parts
left
inside
the
womb.
every
time
you
make
another
pass,
it
turns
out
there's
an
added
risk
of
scarring
or
hurting
the
inside
of
the
womb.
if
you
try
to
induce
demise
through
a
drug
before,
there
is
serious
risks
of
introducing
drugs
into
the
system.
if
the
woman
has
uterine
cancer,
it's
a
serious
problem
of
not
trying
to
get
the
child
out
as
quickly
as
possible.
if
you
have
preeclampsia
or
eclampsia,
where
you're
in
a
situation
where
the
woman
will
be
dead
in
five
minutes
or
10
minutes,
there
could
be
such
a
situation.
the
doctor
thinks
only
one
thing--
get
it
out
as
fast
as
possible.
all
right.
now,
i
know
there
are
doctors
who
think
the
contrary.
there's
lots
of
testimony
of
the
doctors
who
think
roughly
along
the
lines
i've
taken.
that
was
true
in
stenberg
as
well.
so
i
think
the
issue
is
not
that
you
don't
have
support...
you
do...
but
that
the
support
is
contraverted,
and
therefore,
what
do
we
do
in
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
definition
in
the
law
of
significant
risk,
other
than
doctors
saying,
i've
been
trained
to
try
to
save
life
and
i
want
to
perform
the
safest
possible
way?
is
there
some
legal
definition
of
what's
a
small
risk,
a
big
risk,
a
giant
risk?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you're
wrong
about...
you're
probably
wrong
about
this.
but
just
before
you
leave,
i
mean,
this
is
why
it's
so
hard
for
me
to
get
into
the
medical
procedure.
i
heard
you
as
saying,
perhaps
wrongly,
that
well,
the
doctor
can
always
use
a
lethal
injection
to
kill
the
fetus.
all
right?
that
rang
a
bell.
so
i
look
up
and
see
what
the
lower
courts
said
about
that
and
what
they
said
is
that
nearly
everyone
agrees
it
is
not
always
possible
to
kill
the
fetus
by
injection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
says
it
is
not
always
possible...
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
then
goes;
he
tells
you
why.
he
says
there
is
a
dr.
knorr
who
says
you
can't
do
it
when
the
woman
has
a
prior
surgery,
pelvic
inflammatory
disease.
and
then
another
one
says
they
are
not
considered
appropriate
candidates
because
of
medical
illness
or
cardiovascular
disease,
etcetera.
so
there's
a
list
of
medical
situations
where
they
couldn't
use
a
fetal
injection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
bothering
me,
why
i'm
using
this
as
an
illustration
is
that
there
are
so
many
of
these
things.
of
course
there
are
special
cases.
we
are
only
talking
about
a
few,
rare
special
cases.
and
as
soon
as
you
tell
me
that
what's
supposed
to
happen
is
that
the
judges
are
supposed
to
start
deciding
whether
this
is
one
of
these
unusual
cases
or
not,
rather
than
relying
upon
significant
medical
opinion,
as
this
doctor
is
now
illustrating,
i
don't
see
how
it's
going
to
work.
at
least
i
don't
see
how
it's
going
to
work
without
some
people
suffering
serious
illness
as
a
result
of
mistakes
by
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
once
you're
making
a
point
of
that
study,
i
think
it
was
also
the
case
that
the
ones
that
had
the
intact
were
older
or
rather
further
along
in
pregnancy;
isn't
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore
the
risks
were
greater.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
since
the
risks
were
greater,
the
other
side
says
that
this
actually
shows
it
was
safer.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
to
evaluate
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
missed
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
do
that,
because
i
looked
at
that
part
of
the
statute
and,
comparing
it
with
the
statute
in
cathcart,
the
statute
in
cathcart,
the
relevant
part
forbid
a
doctor
from
doing
this
for
the
purpose
of
performing
an
abortion
that
the
doctor
knows
will
kill
the
fetus.
that's
the
language
basically,
right.
and
in
this
one
it
says
you
can't
deliver
past
the
fetal
trunk
for
the
purpose
of
performing
an
overt
act
that
the
doctor
knows
will
kill
the
fetus.
so
i
look
at
those
two
sets
of
words.
i
mean,
i've
simplified
them
slightly,
but
i
don't
see
the
difference.
so
if
the
one
in
cathcart
is
viewed
as
too
vague,
why
is
the
other
one
here
not
too
vague?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'll
grant
you
that
in
respect...
if
what
cathcart
was
worried
about
i
guess
was
you
didn't
know
what
the
words
"significant
substantial
portion
of
the
child.
"
that
tends
to
be
cured.
but
if
what
cathcart
was
worried
about
was
the
fact
that
a
doctor
who
sets
out
to
perform
a
d&e
will,
making
a
pass,
think
he'll
have
the
fetus
dismembered
and,
lo
and
behold,
it
doesn't
dismember,
so
the
bottom
portion
of
the
fetus
descends
outside
the
womb.
and
there
he
is
and
now
what
happens?
if
that's
the
concern,
then
i
guess
you'd
agree
that
that
same
concern
exists
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
such
a
doctor,
a
doctor
who
thinks
that
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
remove,
in
this
emergency
situation,
as
much
of
the
fetus
as
possible
as
quickly
as
possible,
would
such
a
doctor
often,
never,
sometimes
be
thinking
what
i
think
is
likely
to
happen
here,
i'll
make
a
pass
at
the
fetus,
try
to
draw
it
out,
and
what's
most
likely
to
happen
is
that
the
trunk,
a
lot
of
it
will
come
out
and
then
the
head
of
the
fetus
will
dismember,
after
a
lot
of
the
trunk
comes
out.
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
a
doctor
is
being
honest
about
that,
is
there
any
way
that
such
a
doctor
could
escape
the
language
of
the
statute
on
the
government's
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
from
my
going
through
this
record,
i
compare
it
with
stenberg,
with
what's
in
congress.
we
have
two
cases
here.
and
it's
a
fair
conclusion
that
there
are,
in
each
case,
before
congress
and
in
here,
there
are
some
doctors
who
think
this
is
safe
and
some
doctors
who
think
it
isn't
safe.
and
if
you
look
at
the...
sort
of
by
counting,
by
numbers,
i
guess
if
you
look
by
lines
of
testimony
or
by
different
doctors,
interestingly
enough,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
more
doctors
in
these
two
cases
and
in
front
of
congress
who
said
it
is
not
safe
than
there
were
when
we
considered
the
other
case.
and
there
are
fewer
doctors
who
say
it
is
safe
even
with
the
other
case.
so
i
don't
know
if
you're
supposed
to
count
doctors
or
what.
my
question
would
be,
if
this...
do
we
owe
more
deference
to
a
congressional
finding
or
to
congress
than
we
owe
to
a
state
legislature?
what
is...
i
mean,
i
take
it
a
state
legislature
is
democratically
elected,
and
don't
we
owe
similar
deference
to
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
we
owe
deference
to
both,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
we
did,
then
i
think
in
the
nebraska
case,
despite
the
deference
that
was
owed,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
of
nebraska
was
unconstitutional
because
it
lacked
an
exception
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
something
that
came
from
preceding
cases.
so
if
giving
deference
to
nebraska,
we
reach
that
conclusion
there,
and
if
the
deference
that
is
owed
is
the
same,
and
if
the
evidence
is
about
the
same
on
both
sides,
how
can
we
reach
a
different
conclusion
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
i
see
what
you're
driving
at
in
terms
of
the
procedure.
we
are
focusing
on
a
universe
where
the
fetus
is
not
going
to
survive
no
matter
what,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
anyone
being
born
and
living.
they
are
not
going
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
area
of
focus.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
congress
has
said
the
doctor,
you
can
achieve
that
result
through
method
a,
but
not
through
method
b,
and
you're
saying
congress
had
good
reason
for
doing
that.
i
take
it
congress
also
agrees
that
if
method
b,
which
they
don't
want,
were
to
be
necessary
for
the
safety
or
health
of
the
mother,
the
constitution
would
require
it
being
done.
i
didn't
see
anything
here
about
congress
disagreeing
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
fine.
okay.
they
make
a
finding
that
although
we
don't
disagree
with
that,
we
don't
think
it's
ever
necessary
for
the
health
or
safety
of
the
mother.
that's
where
we
are.
now
as
i
look
at
the
record,
i
see
many,
many,
many
doctors
telling
congress
and
everybody
else
that
it
is
necessary,
and
safe.
and
i
see
other
doctors
telling--
congress
primarily,
but
in
court,
too,
that
it
isn't
necessary,
ever
for
safety.
and
so
if
medical
opinion
is
divided,
and
i'm
not
advocating
what
i'm
about
to
say,
i
just
want
to
know
your
reaction.
if
medical
opinion
is
divided,
why
wouldn't
it
be
up
to
this
court
or
could
this
court
say
this
use
of
this
procedure,
we
enjoin
the
statute
to
permit
its
use
but
only
where
appropriate
medical
opinion
finds
it
necessary
for
the
safety
or
health
of
the
mother?
now,
if
congress
is
right,
there
will
be
no
such
case
so
it's
no
problem.
but
if
congress
is
wrong,
then
the
doctor
will
be
able
to
perform
the
procedure
and
congress
couldn't
object
to
that
because
the
congress
isn't
worried
about,
i
mean
congress,
then
congress
was
wrong.
they
agreed
that
we
had
a
health
or
safety
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
just
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
the
doctor's
preference.
you
would
have
to
refer
back
to
prior
cases,
and
what
the
prior
cases
talk
about
including
stenberg
is
not
that
that
the
doctor
simply
has
a
preference,
but
rather
that
there
has
to
be
a
significant
body
of
medical
opinion
that
says
that
this
a
safer
procedure
and
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
mother.
now,
where
that's
true,
the
court
has
previously
said
that
the
constitution
protects
the
right.
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
what
congress
says
that
wants
to
change
that
law.
they
simply
have
a
different
view
of
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they
have
a
different
view
of
the
facts,
why
can't
we
leave
it
up
to
whatever
facts
develop?
if
there
is
an
appropriate
body
of
medical
opinion
that
does
in
fact
believe
this
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
the
mother,
so
be
it,
and
the
abortion
could
be
performed
and
the
injunction
would
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
otherwise
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
terms
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
like
your
characterization
and
the
government's
of
the
state
of
the
record.
i
asked
my
law
clerk
basically
to
go
look
up
every
statement
that
was
made
in
four
forums.
the
first
was
the
first
stenberg
case.
second
was
congress.
third
is
this,
one
of
the
cases
here;
and
the
fourth
is
the
other
case
here.
now,
my
own
impression
of
that
is
if
you're
talking
about
the
medical
need
for
such
a
case,
that
is
for
intact
d&e,
that
there
is
a
risk
attached
if
you
don't
use
it
in
some
instances.
the
fewest
number
of
statements
for
that
proposition
was
in
the
first
stenberg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
more
statements
in
congress,
more
statements
that
you...
doctors
who
say,
i
need
this
procedure
for
safety.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
many
more
in
this
case
than
there
were...
in
these
two
cases
there
are
many
more
than
there
were
in
congress
and
in
congress
there
are
many
more
than
they
were
in
first
stenberg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
we
look
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
the
doctors
who
say,
no,
it
isn't
safe,
there
i'd
have
to
say
there
are
probably
many
more
in
congress
than
there
are...
who
say
it
isn't
safe,
there
are
probably
many
more
in
congress;
and
then
there
are
some
in
these
cases,
too;
and
there
are
hardly
any
in
stenberg,
not
too
many.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
against
you,
in
other
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
i'm
left
with
a
record
where
i
guess
you
have
a
subjective
characterization
that
there
is
at
least
as
much
evidence
in
these
cases
supporting
you
and
as
much
in
congress
supporting
you
as
there
was
in
the
first
stenberg
case.
but
congress
made
this
finding,
so
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
basically
i
think
you
might
have
been
going
after
is,
i
was
saying
that
i
agreed
with
you
in
that
there
is
more
evidence
supporting
your
side
in
these
cases
than
there
was
before
congress,
than
there
was
in
first
stenberg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
still
there
was
a
finding
in
congress
and
there
wasn't
a
finding
in
the
nebraska
legislature,
and
so
does
that
fact
of
the
finding
being
in
congress
and
not
in
the
nebraska
legislature...
what
kind
of
legal
difference
does
that
make?
