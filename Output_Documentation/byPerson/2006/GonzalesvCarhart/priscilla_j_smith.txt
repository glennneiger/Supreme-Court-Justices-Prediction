ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
government
throughout
this
case
has
quarreled
with
the
plaintiff's
statement
of
stenberg
and
congress
quarreled
clearly
with
the
district
court
findings,
but
their
real
argument
here
is
with
this
court
in
the
court's
ruling
in
stenberg,
particularly
in
light
of
the
congressional
findings
that
are,
that
are
frankly
unsupported
by
either
the
congressional
record
or
the
additional
evidence
presented
to
the
district
courts.
the
only
course
here
that
preserves
independence
of
the
judiciary,
that
exemplifies
the
importance
of
stare
decisis,
not
to
mention
the
only
course
that
will
protect
women
from
needless
risks
of
uterine
perforation,
infertility,
sepsis
and
hemorrhage,
is
to
hold
this
act
unconstitutional.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no.
in
terms
of
the
underlying
medical
conditions
there
really
aren't,
your
honor,
and
it
varies
dramatically
according
to
the
practice
of
the
physician.
if
a
physician
is
in
a
high
risk
obgyn
practice,
he
or
she
is
much
more
likely
to
encounter
patients
with
serious
underlying
medical
conditions
such
as
the
ones
that
the
doctors
have
testified
about
in
this
case,
the
liver
disease,
kidney
disease,
heart,
cardiovascular
disease,
cancer
of
the
placenta,
bleeding
placenta
previa,
all
of
these
issues
and
underlying
conditions
that
makes
the
impact
and
the
risks
that
are
reduced
by
the
intact
d&e
particularly
important.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
we
know
that
in
some
practices
it's
quite
frequent,
in
some
practices
it's
not
as
frequent
because
those
are
mostly
hospital
based
practices.
but
on
the
other
hand,
there's
extensive
evidence
in
this
case,
much
more
evidence
frankly,
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
than
there
was
in
the
stenberg
case,
of
the,
of
the--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--because
it's
what
sir?
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
hospitals,
many,
many
hospitals
throughout
the
united
states
refuse
to
provide
any
abortions
whatsoever
as
just
a
blanket
rule.
there
are
some
that
will
provide
abortions
in
certain,
in
certain
circumstances
where
the
woman
is
obtaining
the
abortion
because
of
a
certain
medical
condition.
then
there
are
women
who
are
obtaining
an
abortion
because
they
have
chosen
that
that's
the
best
course
for
them
who
also
have
underlying
medical
conditions.
so
if
you're
a
woman
who
has
chosen
to
obtain
an
abortion
and
you
have
an
underlying
cardiac
disease,
for
example...
we
had
a
case
like
this
in
louisiana.
the
hospital
refused
to
do
the
abortion
because
her
chance
of
dying
from
the
underlying
medical
condition
was
not
over
50
percent.
so
the
availability
of
hospital
services
is
somewhat
unrelated
to
this
case,
but
it
is,
it
is
quite
limited
in
some
circumstances.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
medical
opinion
in
those
cases
is
against
abortion
whatsoever
and
a
refusal
to
use
one's
facilities
to
provide
any
abortion--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--of
any
kind,
not
about
any
particular
procedure.
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
there
are
many
more
in
this--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--that's
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
there
is--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--there
are
many
letters
written
to
congress
that
are
in
the
record.
in
terms
of
live
witnesses,
your
honor--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--there
were
in
congress
eight
live
witnesses
that
testified.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
right.
well,
the
important
point,
your
honor,
is
that
even
if
the
court
applied
the
highest
level
of
deference
under
turner,
the
findings
would
be
rejected
and
must
be
rejected,
as
all
three
district
courts,
held
because
they're
simply
unreasonable
even
under
a
turner
standard.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
it
was,
as
was
the
brief
that
was
filed,
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
in
this
case
in
stenberg
was
before
congress,
and
also
testimony
from
numerous
physicians
in
the
form
of
a
letter.
in
terms
of
live
witnesses,
there
were
simply
not
that
many.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
fine,
your
honor.
i've
lost
track
of
my
train
of
thought,
though,
i
think.
what
i
was
saying
was
there
were
eight
witnesses
who
testified
live.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
and
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
in
this
case,
it
makes
none.
while
it's
an
extremely
interesting
academic
question
about
the
level
of
deference
that
should
be
applied
in
this
kind
of
circumstance,
here
it
really
is
academic
because
under,
even
under
the
turner
standard,
if
applied
in
the
way
that
turner
actually
applied
deference,
to
carefully
review
the
findings
in
light
of
the
evidence
in
congress
and
again
in
light
of
the
evidence
in
the
district
court--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--well,
i
think
there
is,
there's
been
some
confusion
about
the
word
"necessary"
and
it's
been
used
sometimes
to
talk
about
whether
there
are
other
procedures
that
could
be
used,
as
opposed
to
the
determination
that
it
is
the
safest
procedure
that
reduces
significantly
the
risk
of
very
serious
complications,
not
the
risks
of
minor
complications.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i...
the
issue
of
the
scope
and
breadth
of
the
law
is...
i
think
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
this
is
a
very
broad
law
that
applies
to
d&e
abortions
and,
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
said
about
the
intent
of
abortions,
abortion
providers
like
dr.
rabacker
and
others,
they
actually,
their
intent
is
always
to
remove
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible,
and
the
district
courts
have
recognized
that
as
an
intent
that's
covered
under
the
terms
of
the
act.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
believe
a
marginal
benefit
in
safety
is
enough
and
i
don't
believe
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
testimony
from
over,
from
at
least
11
board
certified
obgyns,
from
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists,
is
that
the
reduction
in
risk
is
significant
and
that
it
reduces
the
risk
of
serious
complications,
such
as
uterine
perforation,
which
can
lead
to
hysterectomies
and
infertility.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
we
don't
have
a
quantification
of
the
safety.
what
we
what
we
have
is
the
clinical
experience
of
major
leading
physicians
in
the
field,
who've
testified
that
they've
used
both
procedures.
in
fact,
many
of
them
have
testified
that
they
perforated
uteruses
in
nonintact
d&es
and
they've
never
perforated
a
uterus
in
an
intact
d&e.
and
that
in
fact
is
borne
out
by
the
chasen
study,
a
very
small
study
with
very
small
numbers,
but
it
shows
all
the
serious
complications
are
in
the
nonintact
group.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
blueprint
that
this
court
laid
out,
that
certainly
is
suggested
in
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
stenberg,
was
rejected
by
congress.
she
references
three
statutes,
that
if
they
had
included
a
health
exception,
she
thinks
would
have
been
constitutional.
they
all
include
the
word
intact.
i
think
there's
another
narrower
construction
of
the
act
too
that
is
possible.
adding
in
the
word
intact,
reading
in
the
word
intact,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
it
is,
but
certainly
congress
could
have
done
that
and
other
states
have
done
it,
but
congress
set
out
not
to
do
that.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
problem
with
the
law
is
that
because
it's
not
limited
to
intact,
it
would
in
fact
cover
the
procedures
that
are
performed
by
physicians
who
intend
to
perform
a
procedure
as
intact
as
possible
but
simply
don't
expect
that.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
the
doctors
perform
the
same
dilation
protocols
whether
they
are
going
to
perform
a
d&e
or
an
intact
d&e,
and
that's
true
for
dr.
chasen
and
dr.
westhoff,
who
performed
both
intact
and
nonintact
procedures.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
it
doesn't
play
out
that
way.
doctors
do
have
different
dilation
protocols,
but
they
are
often
looking
for
as
much
dilation
as
they
can
get.
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--it
varies
by
doctor.
for
example,
dr.
carhart
uses
the
same
dilation
protocol
whether
he's
going
to
do
an
intact
or
a
nonintact.
other
doctors
might
try
to
do
more
dilation.
and
the
doctors,
importantly,
can't
control
the
amount
of
dilation
they
get,
so
a
decision
happens.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
not--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--well,
they
are
always
looking
for
a
minimal
amount
of
dilation.
then
people
who
chose
to
do
another
day
of
dilation,
for
example,
that
could
add
additional
dilation.
but
for
the
first
day
of
dilation,
no,
your
honor.
they
don't
seek
more
or
less
over
one
day.
they
might
do
a
second
day
or--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--not
in
the
first
day
of
dilation,
no.
they
can't
control
how
much
dilation
is
going
to
occur.
they
need
a
minimal
amount
and
they
are
not
going
to
shoot
for
less
than
that.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
each
doctor
testifies
about
their
own
dilation
protocols,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
in
the
eighth
circuit
appendix.
those...
those...
portions
of
that
testimony,
and
are
cited
more
specifically
in
the
eighth
circuit
briefs,
which
goes
more
into
the
factual
detail,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
have
the
cites
right
now.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
not
if
this
is
not
limited
to
intact,
your
honor,
because
then
you
would
be
limiting
d&e
abortions,
which
is
95
percent
of
all
abortions,
to
circumstances
where
the
doctor
could
prove
that
it
was
in
fact
the
safest
procedure.
and
we've
had
doctors
testify
in
trial,
for
example,
that
they
refused
to
describe
even
intact
or
regular
d&es
to
their
patients
because
they
believe
induction
is
always
safer.
so
those
doctors,
i
think
would
still
be
at
risk,
and
it
would
put
95
percent
of
second
trimester
abortions
at
risk
in
that
case,
to
prosecution
for
performing
a
d&e
when
you
should
have
been
performing
an
induction
procedure.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
your
honor,
because
actually
that
same
language
is
in
the
stenberg,
the
nebraska
statute.
it
also
was
targeted
at
deliberately
intentionally.
i
do
think
that
if
there
is
a
construction
that
would
narrow
the
law
to
a
limited
amount
of
intact
d&es,
if
you
read
the
"for
the
purpose
of"
language
in
the
statute,
to
be
performing
an
overt
act
for
the
sole
purpose
of
completing
delivery,
then...
or
rather...
i'm
sorry.
for
the
purpose
of
performing
an
overt
act
that
causes
fetal
demise,
that
does
not
facilitate
delivery
of
the
statute...
of
the
fetus.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i'm
sorry.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
line
that
could
be
drawn,
your
honor,
because
anyone
who
does
a
d&e
is
intending
to
remove
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible,
and
always
can
have
the
intent
to
go
to
the
anatomical
landmark
that's
here.
i'm
suggesting
a
different
interpretation
that
uses
the
"for
the
purpose
of"
language
where
it
says
for
the
purpose
of
performing
an
overt
act
that
the
person
knows
will
kill
the
partially
delivered
living
fetus.
if
that
language
was
interpreted
to
be
for
the
sole
purpose
of
performing
fetal
demise
at
that
point,
rather
than
what
the
doctors
do,
which
is
perform
the
action
that
causes
fetal
demise
in
order
to
facilitate
delivery
of
the
fetus.
so
if
it's
not
to
facilitate
delivery
of
the
fetus--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--well,
there
are
allegations
in
the
congressional
record,
for
example,
in
reference...
in
justice
thomas'
dissent
by
nurse
schaffer,
dr.
pamela
smith,
about
circumstances
where
the
physician
actually
holds
the
fetus
in
the
woman's
body
in
order
to
cause
fetal
demise,
rather
than
causing
fetal
demise
because
it's
an
integral
part
of
removal
of
the
fetus
from
the
woman's
uterus.
and
those
circumstances
would
be
banned
under
that
interpretation.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
turner
point,
if
i
may
for
a
minute,
the
issue
of
deference
to
congressional
finding.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
it
would...
it
would
ban
certainly
a
certain
type
of
intact
procedure
that
was
discussed,
and
i
think
the
image
many
people
have
of
"partial
birth
abortion"
frankly,
that
this
is
something
that's
done
gratuitously,
not
as
an
integral
part
of
making
this
procedure
the
safest
for
the
woman,
and
avoiding
instrumentation
and
avoiding
perforation
and
hysterectomies,
which
are
serious
complications
that
though
rare,
when
they
occur,
they
are
catastrophic
and
life
changing
and
disastrous.
so
the
numbers
are
not
high
of
any
complications,
but
the
complications
when
they
occur
are,
are
devastating.
and
this
is
what
the
doctors
are
experiencing
when
they
perform
intact
d&es,
that
they
are
not
having
these
types
of
complications.
so...
if
i
can
move
to
the
deference
point,
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
deference
to
congressional
findings
because
there
is
significant
authority
from
this
court
of
course,
saying
that
where
there
are
danger
signs
of
constitutional
risks,
as
the
court
recently
said
in
randall
versus
sorrell,
that
the
court
must
independently
and
carefully
review
congressional
findings.
and
the
court
has
rejected
findings
that
attempted
to
change
either
by
findings
of
fact
or
legal
findings,
that
attempted
to
change
a
constitutional
standard.
but
in
any
case,
the
findings
in
this
case
are
simply
unreasonable
and
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
if
you
go
to
the
findings
themselves,
the
ultimate
finding
in
14o,
which
claims
that
it
is
actually
relying
on
the
preceding
findings,
it
says,
"for
these
reasons,
congress
finds
that
partial
birth
abortion
is
never
medically
indicated.
"
and
then
you
go
backwards
and
look
at
the
reasons.
the
reasons
are
the
findings
that
are
not
defended
by
the
government,
that
were
not
defended
by
the
government
witnesses
and
that
are
blatantly
false,
except
for
perhaps
one
of
them.
there
are
findings
of,
that
partial
birth
abortion
poses
serious
risks.
the
government
witnesses
agreed
that
this
was
not
true.
their
findings
that
partial
birth
abortion
is
not
taught
in
medical
schools.
of
course,
we
know
that
is
simply
not
true,
it's
an
integral
part
of
abortion
training
at
major
medical
institutions
like
cornell,
columbia,
yale,
nyu,
northwestern,
etc.
it
says
that
abortion,
partial
birth
abortion
is
a
disfavored
practice
along
abortion
providers.
that
is
absolutely
not
true.
and
it
says
that
there
are
no
comparative
studies.
we
know
now
that
is
not
true
because
the
chasen
study
has
come
out,
and
is
the
first
study
of
its
kind
to
try
to
evaluate
the
differences
between
intact
and
non
intact.
it
is
still
true
that
there
are
no
controlled
studies,
there
is
no
randomized
clinical
trial,
but
if
that
were
the
standard,
no
new
and
safer
abortion
procedures
could
ever
be
developed.
turning
back,
your
honors,
to
the
health
issue.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
not
very
common.
not
very
common,
your
honor.
it
would
occur
in
circumstances
where
there
is
a
significant
fetal
anomaly
and
some
kind
of
a,
something
called
a
sides,
or
another
type
of
fetal
anomaly
where
there
is
a
distension
of
the
abdomen,
but
it's
very
rare.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know
if
i
understand.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes,
but
these
are
circumstances
where
the
fetus
can't
be
delivered.
that's
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
fetus
is
obstructed
and
so
the
overt
act
that
takes
place
is--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--the
obstruction
would
come
from
a
distension
of
the
abdomen,
usually
from
a
fetal
anomaly
like
a
sides,
which
is,
this
is
a
serious
anomaly.
it's
lethal
anomalies
that
i
was
talking
about.
and
in
those
circumstances,
an
overt
act
would
need
to
be
performed
that
would
in
fact
cause
fetal
demise
before
the
fetus
could
be,
the
delivery
could
be
continued.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
what,
what
the
court
held
in
stenberg
in
applying
the
appropriate
medical
judgment
standard
of
casey,
was
that
there
had
to
be
a
substantial
body
of
medical
opinion,
an
objective
standard
that
in
fact
supports
the
use
of
that
procedure.
and
that
both,
that
balances
concerns
against
protecting
a
woman's
health
with
a
concern
of
unfettered
discretion,
which
the
court
has
rejected.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i'm
sorry.
i--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--yeah.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
true,
your
honor,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
pose
an
undue
burden
on
the
woman,
which
as
you
know,
certainly
the
circumstance
with
the
d&e,
which
is
95
percent
of
abortions,
under
the
stenberg
ruling.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no.
i
understood
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be,
could
the
state
prohibit
what
it
thinks
is
not
the
safest.
and
under
the
stenberg
ruling,
although
the
court
hasn't
addressed
that
question
directly,
under
stenberg
what
the
court
has
said
is,
the
court
can
ban
procedures
only
where
there
is
not
significant
medical
authority
supporting
their
use
as
the
safest
procedure
in
some
circumstances.
so
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
but
the
court
has
not
ever
addressed
the
question,
can
we
ban
a
procedure
that's
not
the
safest.
i
think
the
ruling
in
stenberg
would
say
well,
there
has
to
be
significant
medical
authority
that
in
some
circumstances
it
is
the
safest.
the
alternative
argument
would
be,
but,
if
it
is
the
procedure
that's
used
in
95
percent
of
the
cases,
or
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
and
banning
it
would
thereby
deny
women
the
right
to
get
an
abortion
and
be
a
substantial
obstacle
in
their
path
in
obtaining
a
legal
abortion,
that
would
be
the
reason
you
couldn't
ban
it.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
