mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
the
same
basic
constitutional
question
concerning
the
federal
partial
birth
abortion
act
as
the
first
case.
of
course,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
decision
under
review
here
went
much
further
in
invalidating
the
federal
act.
if
i
could
begin
by
talking
about
whether
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
medical
necessity
or
just
some
marginal
effect
on
the
risks.
i
think
in
order
to
fairly
understand
the
argument
that
respondents
are
making
in
this
case,
their
argument
has
to
be
a
matter
of
simply
marginal
risks,
because
one
illustration
of
this,
as
i
indicated
in
the
first
argument,
if
a
doctor
really
believes
that
a
d&x
procedure
is
the
way
to
go
in
a
case
then
there's
no
ban
on
the
procedure
as
such.
what
the
act
bans
is
the
infliction
of
the
d&x
procedure
on
a
living
fetus.
so
if
a
doctor
really
thinks
the
d&x
procedure
is
the
way
to
go,
he
can
induce
fetal
demise
at
the
outset
of
the
procedure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
take
as
a
point
of
departure
the
specific
risks
that
you
associated
with
the
injection
that
induces
fetal
demise,
because
if
there
isn't
a
significant
risk
to
that
injection,
then
all
the
other
benefits
that
are
associated
with
the
d&x
procedure
don't
matter
because
they
can
perform
the
d&x
procedure.
now
if
you
look
through
the
record
on
this
point,
i
think
you
will
not
find
any
testimony
that
supports
a
significant
risk
from
that
injection.
yes,
there
are
risks
because
there
are
risks
from
any
medical
procedure,
but
the
risks
are
not
significant.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
all
respect,
i
think
if
a
single
injection
that
doesn't
take
any
particular
risk
other
than
the
fact
that
it's
an
injection,
if
that
counts
as
a
significant
risk,
then
we
might
as
well
strike
the
word
"significant"
from
the
discussion
in
stenberg.
and
then
i
think
what
you
have
is
that
it's
very
clear
that
their
position
is
one
of
zero
tolerance
for
any
marginal
risk
to
maternal
health.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it's
a
very
difficult
question
to
evaluate
in
the
abstract,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
it
actually,
that
question,
though,
has
direct
bearing
on
this
case,
because
congress
after
all
found
that
there
was
some
risks
with
the
d&x
procedure.
the
most
prominent
one
that
i
would
point
to
is
the
risk
of
cervical
incompetence
because
the
d&x
procedure
does...
it
does
require
additional
dilation,
which
can
be
associated
with
risks
of
losing
future
pregnancies.
and
that
was
born
out,
although
not
at
a
level
of
statistical
significance,
in
the
chasen
study
by
a
plaintiff
practitioner,
where
2
of
the
17
women
who
had
the
d&x
procedure
and
were
available
for
follow
up
care
had
an
early
preterm
pregnancy
in
the
follow
up.
so
i
think
those
risks
are
born
out
in
the
only
study
that's
available.
and
i
think
the
question
becomes,
now,
if
d&x
were
some
life
saving
procedure
for
something
that
there
was
no
other
known
cure
for,
you
might
think,
well,
those
are
the
risks
you
run.
but
when
there
remains
available
the
d&e
procedure,
which
has
been
well
tested
and
works
every
single
time
as
a
way
to
terminate
the
pregnancy,
then
i
think
risks
that,
if
you
were
talking
about
a
life
saving
treatment
for
some
life
threatening
condition
with
no
known
cure,
those
risks
might
not
be
significant
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is
a
risk,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
that
even
in
those
limited
circumstances,
that
the
marginal
risk
between
the
d&x
procedure
and
the
d&e
procedure
are
really
as
far
as
i
can
tell
nonexistent.
even
in
that
condition,
unless
there's
some
reason
not
to
put
the
injection
in,
if
the
doctor
really
thought
the
d&x
procedure
was
the
way
to
go,
he
could
begin,
as
dr.
carhart
does
in
every
single
case
after
the
17th
week
and
start
off
with
a
digoxin
injection
or
potassium
chloride
injection,
induce
fetal
demise,
and
he
has
nothing
to
worry
about
from
this
statute.
and
i
think
the
very
fact
that
they
are
attributing
significant
risks
to
a
single
injection
shows
that
at
bottom
their
position
is
a
zero
tolerance
position.
and
that's
a
legitimate
position,
i
suppose,
but
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedence,
most
notably
the
casey
decision.
because
if
all
you
needed
to
do
is
point
to
some
marginal
risk,
then
this
court
should
have
struck
down
the
24-hour
waiting
period
in
the
casey
decision,
because
the
plaintiffs
there
said
the
24-hour
waiting
condition
has
imposed
significant
risks.
they
were
backed
in
that
point
by
an
amicus
brief
by
acog.
but
this
court
didn't
say,
well,
you
know,
you're
right,
there's
marginal
risks,
we're
going
to
apply
a
zero
tolerance
rule.
this
court
instead
upheld
the
24-hour
period,
even
though
it
required
overruling
akron
i's
contrary
decision
and
this
court
pointed,
of
course,
to--
akron
i
as
an
exemplar
of
the
pre
casey
decisions
that
put
too
little
weight
on
the
legitimate
countervailing
interest
that
the
government
has
in
this
area.
and
so
with
respect,
i
think
that
the
argument
they
are
making
is
effectively
an
argument
for
returning
to
akron
i
and
thornburgh,
where
the
rule
of
law
was
that
there
would
be
no
interference
between
a
doctor
and
the
doctor's
patient
and
the
doctor's
best
judgment
as
to
how
to
treat
the
patient.
this
court
of
course
consciously
moved
away
from
that
in
casey
and
expressly
repudiated
the
language
in
akron
i
and
thornburgh
to
that
effect.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
let
me
answer
it
this
way
and
maybe
if
you
want
me
to
take
you
specifically
to
the
text,
i
can
do
that.
but
i
think
the
bottom
line
would
be
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute,
the
most
important
thing
is
for
those
doctors,
like
dr.
cranen
or
dr.
vivicar,
who
try
to
do
the
d&e
procedure
every
time,
and
they
succeed
99
or
100
percent
of
the
time.
well,
in
the
1
percent
of
the
cases
where
they
inadvertently
deliver
the
fetus
past
the
anatomical
landmark,
we
would
say
they
are
not
covered
by
the
statute
because
they
would
not
satisfy
what
is
really
a
compound
mens
rea
requirement
in
the
statute,
which
requires
that
the
delivery
of
the
fetus
be
intentional
and
deliberate
and
for
the
purpose
of
committing
the
overt
act
of
killing
fetus.
and
in
those
cases,
of
course,
the
intent
of
the
doctor
performing
the
d&e
isn't
to
deliver
the
fetus
at
all;
it's
to
deliver
a
fetal
arm
or
a
fetal
leg
as
part
of
the
dismemberment
procedure.
so
they
would
not
be
covered
by
the
mens
rea
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
could
measure
it
from
either
time
point.
i
think
the
better
view
is
actually
that
it
would
be
measured
from
the
beginning
of
the
surgical
operation,
though
the
evidence
of
their
intent
at
the
beginning
of
the
dilation
would
be
very,
very
relevant.
the
reason
i
would
say
that
is
i
think
if
somebody
tries
to
dilate
and
then
gets
an
extreme
amount
of
dilation
at
the
point
they
start
the
procedure,
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
would
still
be
for
them
to
do
a
dismemberment
procedure
at
that
point,
rather
than
an
intact
removal.
but
if
this
court
thought
that
the
constitutional
line
mattered
on
the
answer
to
that,
then
you
could
start
from
the
beginning
of
the
dilation
because
i
think
in
fairness
the
differences
between
the
two
procedures
are
probably
most
manifest
in
the
dilation
regimen.
i
also
think,
though,
the
record
supports
the
notion
that
there
are
differences
even
once
you
begin
the
procedure
as
to
how
you
manipulate
the
fetus.
i
mean,
dr.
chasen
for
example,
who
is
trying
to
do
the
intact
removal,
says
that
after
he
has
one
leg
removed
he
effectively
tries
to
reach
back
up
and
swing
the
second
leg
across
so
he
can
remove
the
entire
fetal
body.
if
you're...
obviously
if
you're
performing
a
dismemberment
d&e
you're
not
trying
to
swing
the
second
leg
across;
you're
simply
continuing
to
pull
or
twist
on
the
first
extremity
that
presents
itself.
so
i
think
there
are
differences
even
at
the
procedural
level.
so
i
think
that
it
would
probably
be
most
consistent
with
congress's
intent
to
measure
it
from
the
beginning
of
the
surgical
part
of
the
procedure.
but
if
you,
as
i
say,
in
order
to
save
the
statute,
i
think
it's
amenable
to
the
contrary
interpretation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
but
can
i
respond
to
that
specifically?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
can
i
respond
to
that
specifically?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
respond
to
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
there
are
certain
situations
where
the
injection
is
contraindicated.
i
think
they'd
be
relatively
rare
situations.
and
i
think,
you
know,
you
could
imagine
i
suppose
that
the
statute
might
pose
a
problem
if
you
could
identify
particular
conditions
where
a
d&x
was
particularly
useful,
and
those
were
also
situations
where
an
injection
would
be
contraindicated.
i
think,
you
know,
the
universe
of
that
may
be
zero,
it
may
be
one
in
a
million;
i
don't
know,
but
it's
very
small.
another
point
that's
made
in
the
record
which
i
think
is
important
is
they
suggest
well,
you
know,
maybe,
maybe
if
you
can't
do
the
injection
into
the
heart
of
the
fetus,
then
you're
only
going
to
be
successful
something
like
92
percent
of
the
times.
i
think
though
for
purposes
of
the
mens
rea
requirement
would
certainly
take
care
of
any
concern
that
the
physician
would
have--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
breyer,
i
wish
we
were
talking
about
just
a
few
rare
cases
because
i
think
if
we
were,
there
would
be,
the
statute
would
be
amenable
to
not
being
applied
in
those
rare
cases.
but
this
is
one
thing
that
i
think
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
of
the
podium
will
agree
with
me
on,
is
that
their
doctors
don't
think
that
this
is
a
safer
procedure
in
rare
cases.
they
think
it's
a
safer
procedure
every
single
time.
and
that's
why
doctors
like
dr.
chasen
and
dr.
frederickson
try
to
do
the
d&x
procedure
every
single
time,
and
they
don't
do
it
because
they
are
indifferent
to
health,
i
suppose.
in
their
best
judgment
they
think
that's
the
better
way
to
go.
and
it's
just
a
question
ultimately
of
whether
you're
going
to
defer
to
individual
doctors'
judgments,
even
when
it's
very
much
of
a
minority
judgment;
i
mean
anything
you
want
to
say
about
this
procedure
it
is
the
heterodox
procedure,
not
the
orthodoxy.
most
ob/gyns
are
going
to
do
the
d&e
procedure,
not
the
d&x
procedure.
even
in
the
nebraska
case
three
of
the
four
plaintiffs
don't
try
to
do
the
intact
removal,
so
i
think
that
just
gives
you,
just
a,
know
you,
anecdotal
observation
that
you
are
talking
about
the
rare
procedure,
the
heterodox
procedure.
and
so
the
question
is
when
you
have
a
perfectly
safe
alternative,
and
you
have
some
doctors
who
like
to
do
is
it
a
different
way,
can
congress
countermand
the
doctors'
judgment
or
do
the
doctors
get
the
final
word?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean
that
might
be
a
situation...
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
realistic
hypothetical,
i
mean,
let
me
just
say
that.
if
that
turned
out
to
be
a
realistic
hypothetical,
that
might
be
an
example
of
where
this
question
i
talked
about
with
justice
stevens
might
matter.
which
is
in
that
case
it
might
matter
whether
or
not
the
intent
was
measured--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
born
out
in
this
record,
it's
the
other
way,
which
is
doctors
who
want
to
perform
a
d&x,
often,
in
a
majority
of
the
cases
end
up
performing
a
d&e.
but
the
doctors
that
set
out
to
perform
a
d&e,
in
dr.
vibhakar's
case
she
says
a
hundred
percent
of
the
time,
she
ends
up
with
dismemberment.
dr.
creinen
says
it's
99
%
of
the
time
that
he
ends
up
with
dismemberment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
and
you
can,
you
can,
you
can
tell
you
can
tell
from
the
fact
that
a
doctor,
like
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
nebraska
case,
dr.
fitzhugh,
says,
that,
well,
i
don't
do
the
intact
removal
because
if
i
wanted
to
do
that
i
would
have
to
do
a
second
round
of
dilation
with
a
second
round
of
laminaria.
and
of
course,
that
second
round
of
laminaria
is
also
a
medical
procedure.
like
the
injection,
every
medical
procedure
has
some
risks,
risks
of
infection.
if
you
looked
at
dr.
creinen's
testimony,
this
is
at
174
a
to
177
a
in
the
eighth
circuit
petition
appendix,
he
says
that
he
doesn't
like
to
do
a
second
round
of
laminaria
dilation
because
it's
painful
to
the
patient.
and
that's
his
testimony.
so
there
are
countervailing
indications
here.
and
as
i
say,
this
idea
of
trying
to
prohibit
a
practice
that
involves
further
dilation
is
not
an
irrelevant
concern
from
a
health
standpoint,
because
one
of
the
things
that
congress
heard
was
that
there
were
risks
to
future
pregnancies
from
cervical
incompetence.
and
that's
a
particularly
important
concern
because
first
of
all,
the
plaintiff's
experts
aren't
in
a
very
good
position
to
evaluate
that
risk
because
they
provide
abortion
services,
not
follow
up
services.
so
they're
not
in
a
good
position
to
judge
that
risk.
second
of
all,
the
only
study
we
have
here
points
out
that
there
is
a
greater
incidence
of
that
preterm
delivery
in
the
group
that
had
a
d&x
procedure.
now
again
they
say,
they
are
going
to
come
up
and
say
well
it's
not
statistically
significant.
but
the
numbers
i
think
are
striking.
they
had
17
women
in
the
group
that
had
a
d&x
and
came
back.
two
of
them
had
a
preterm
pregnancy.
the
d&e
group
was
much
larger,
45,
and
two
of
them
had
a
preterm
delivery.
now
i
think
as
a
commonsense
manner,
if
you
know
that
you
were
going
to
be
in
a
room
with
17
people
where
two
people
were
going
to
have
something
bad
happen
to
them,
or
in
a
room
with
45
and
two...
bad
things
were
going
to
happen
to
two,
i
know
which
room
i'd
like
to
be
in.
and
all
i'm
pointing
out--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
if
i
could
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it's
even
more
complicated
than
that,
justice
breyer,
because
in
fact,
you're
right
that
the
d&x
patients
were
at
a
further
gestational
age,
but
the
d&e
patients
were
actually
older.
and
so
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but
it
happens
that,
the
d&e
patients
were
on
average
two
years
older,
which
i
think
also
would
be
associated
with
greater
risk.
so
i
think
it's
a
wash.
but
i
still
think
the
chasen
study
net
is
quite
helpful
to
our
side.
for
one
thing,
this
is
a
study
put
together
by
one
of
the
plaintiff
practitioners,
a
plaintiff
in
the
southern
district
case,
based
on
a
study
of
his
own
practice.
and
of
course
one
of
the
intuitions
about
the
d&x
procedure
is
because
you
remove
it
intact
it's
going
to
be
a
faster
procedure
and
there
is
going
to
be
less
blood
loss.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
what
did
he
find
when
he
studied
that?
it
was
exactly
the
same
for
the
two
procedures.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean
i
don't
think
it
should
figure
in
this
court's
decision.
i
mean
principally
because
the
other
side
in
neither
case
makes
a
challenge
based
on
the
commerce
clause,
and
i
suppose
there
is
two
reasons
for
that.
that
legal
reason
that
they
don't
bring
the
challenge
is
because
there
is
a
jurisdictional
element
that
i
think
would
address
the
challenges
as
a
doctrinal
matter.
the
practical
reason
i
think
is
because
this
isn't
the
only
instance
in
which
the
federal
government
has
gotten
involved
to
address
issues
related
to
the
abortion
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
but
also
access
to
clinics,
in
the
the
face
act,
which
is
also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well...
it's
certainly
true
that
abortion
has
been
dealt
with
at
a
federal
level
one
way
or
another
since
1973.
so
i
think
that's
also
part
of
the
backdrop,
but
i
also
think,
i
mean,
you
know,
the
federal
government
gets
involved
in
this
issue,
you
know,
depending
on
your
perspective,
for
good
or
for
harm.
it's
there
to
protect
access
to
the
abortion
clinics--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
we
have
taken,
the
federal
government
hasn't
taken
a
definitive
position
on
that.
i
think
it
could
be
interpreted
either
way.
i
think
my
understanding
is
the
face
context,
a
free
clinic
would
be
covered.
there's
not
a
jurisdictional
element
in
the
face
statute.
so
there
may
be
differences
as,
in
application.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
by,
i
mean,
you
know,
the
court's
precedents
in
other
areas
has
suggested
it's
just
not
a
matter
of
whether
the
ultimate
service
is
provided
in
commerce
but
in
order
to
get
the
services
they
have
to
take--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
exactly.
i
don't,
i
mean,
that
hasn't
been
briefed
up
in
this
case.
if
it
had
been
we'd
probably
have
a
definitive
position
one
way
or
another.
but
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
in
this
facial
challenge
where
that
hasn't
been
a
feature
of
the
challenge
turns
on
the
answer
to
that
question
one
way
or
another.
i
think
in
regards
to
the
chasen
study
the
last
thing
i
would
say
about
it
though
is
that
it's
important
because
most
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
are
intuitive
arguments.
they
are
intuitive
arguments,
that
they
would
be
less
passive,
so
that
will
be
more
safe.
and
what
i
think
is
telling
is
that
the
same
intuition
would
lead
to
the
notion
that
it
would
be
quicker
and
there
will
be
less
blood
loss.
and
when
that
was
actually
tested
in
a
controlled
study,
it
turned
out
not
to
be
the
case.
the
last
thing
i'll
say
about
the
chasen
study
is
there
was
this
indication
that
the
two
most
serious
complications
were
associated
with
the
d&e
procedure.
but
one
thing
that
i
think
is
important
to
understand
about
the
chasen
study
is
it
is
a
retrospective
study
of
dr.
chasen
and
his
partner's
own
practice.
now
what
they
do
in
every
case
is
they
set
out
to
perform
a
d&x
procedure,
and
so
what
they
are
studying
and
what
they
call
the
d&x
procedures,
that
cohort
are
the
times
when
they
tried
to
do
a
d&x
procedure
and
they
were
successful.
the
d&e
cohort
from
this
study,
is
you
know,
are
those
circumstances
where
he
and
his
partner
tried
to
do
a
d&x
procedure,
weren't
successful
and
did
a
d&e
procedure.
now
why
is
that
significant?
because
it
shows
as
chasen
noted
in
his
article
that
in
those
situations
that
were
d&es
and
they
were
associated
with
serious
complications
there
was
nothing
he
could
have
done
about
it.
he
could
have
performed
a
d&x,
he
tried
to
perform
a
d&x
and
it
wasn't
successful,
so
he
ended
up
performing
a
d&e.
and
so
i
really
think
on
balance
the
chasen
study
ends
up
supporting
our
position,
because
the
first
time
you
have
any
kind
of
controlled
study
what
you
find
is
that
some
of
the
intuition
turns
out
not
to
be
true,
and
the
safety
benefits
from
these
are
a
wash,
and
the
one
sort
of
loose
end
from
the
study
is
the
threat
that
you
do
see
from
the
greater
dilation.
now
it's
not
statistically
robust,
but
i
think
that
it
does
bear
out
one
of
congress's
concerns.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
i...
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
and
as
i
tried
to
indicate
in
rebuttal,
that's
really
not
a
concern
because,
the
difference
is
whether
some
clinics
will
only
offer
the
d&x
and
the
d&e
and
will
say
that
basically
you've
got
to
go
to
a
hospital
to
get
the
induction
procedure.
but
that
doesn't
really,
i
don't
think
matter,
because
the
point
is
anybody
who
can
get
a
d&x
who
is
at
a
clinic
can
also
get
a
d&e.
in
every
single
case
the
doctor
that
can
perform
the
d&x
can
also
offer
the
d&e.
and
since
the
d&e
is
what
the
district
court
in
the
nebraska
case
described
as
the
gold
standard
of
saftey,
i
think
every
woman
in
every
case
is
going
to
have
that
option
of
a
safe,
of
a
safe
pregnancy
option.
and
again
one
way
to
illustrate
that
is
chasen.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
but,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
we
have
our
answer
to
that,
which
is
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
requires
the
intent
at
the
outset
of
the
procedure,
and
therefore
nobody...
in
the
99
percent
of
the
cases
that
dr.
crainer
sets
out
to
performs
a
d&e
and
succeeds,
there's
no
issue
in
the
world
because
everybody
would
look
at
that
and
say
that's
a
d&e.
in
the
one
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
it's
because
of
the
addition
of
the
anatomical
landmark
language
to
the
federal
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
only
with
the
caveat,
though,
is
that
i
think
this
court
really
didn't
have
to
confront
the
second
concern
because
it
had
the
first
concern.
and
if
you
thought
that
a
leg,
which
this
court
did,
was
a
substantial
portion,
and
that
was
the,
that
was
the
act
that
induced
fetal
demise,
either
way
it
was
covered
no
matter
what
your
purpose
was,
because
the
doctor's
purpose
in
removing
the
leg
was
to
induce
fetal
demise.
here
the
compound
mens
rea
requirement
works
with
the
anatomical
landmark
language,
so
that
what
you
need
to
satisfy
the
statute
is
the
deliberate
and
purposeful
intent
to
remove
the
fetus
past
the
navel
with
the
purpose
of
performing
an
overt
act
that
will,
will
lead
to
fetal
demise,
which
is
not
covered
when
you
don't
even
have
the
intent
to
take
it
out
of
the...
past
the
anatomical
landmark
in
the
first
place
and
you're
trying
to
do
something
that's
going
to
take
place
in
utero.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
few
final
points.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
constitutionality
of
congress's
act
depends
on
whether
the
anatomical
landmark
is
the
navel
or
up
to
the
head.
congress,
as
everyone
recognizes,
had
to
draw
a
line.
i
think
drawing
the
line
at
more
than
halfway
out
is
a
pretty
good
place
to
draw
the
line.
second,
my
learned
cocounsel
is
certainly
correct.
this
is
a
preenforcement
challenge,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
but
the
point
is,
this
is
a
preenforcement
facial
challenge,
and
if
the
court
rejects
it
and
allows
this
statute
to
go
into
operation,
it
will
not
foreclose
the
possibility
of
a
future
preenforcement
as
applied
challenge
that
focuses
on
particular
medical
conditions.
that's
not
something,
though,
that
one
can
reach
in
this
record,
because
as
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
at
147a,
there
is
no
specific
condition
here
in
which
the
d&x
procedure
is
particularly
ready
met
for
or
otherwise
is
medically
necessary.
rather,
the
claims
in
this
case
are
that
it's
always
better.
that's
what
some
doctors
say.
it's
a
heterodox
position,
it's
not
the
majority
position,
but
it's
not
focussed
on
specific
situations.
the
other
thing
it's
not
focused
on,
and
this
is
in
reference
to
something
that
justice
breyer
mentioned,
it's
not
focused
on
emergencies.
another
thing
that
the
district
court
noted
at
page
128a
of
its
opinion
is
that
the
d&e
procedure
and
the
d&x
procedure,
neither
of
them
are
particularly
good
in
dealing
with
true
medical
emergencies
where
time
is
of
the
essence,
because
both
these
procedures
require
substantial
advance
time
to
do
the
dilation.
and
since
the
d&x
procedure
requires
more
dilation,
i
actually
think
in
an
emergency,
you'd
probably
end
up
performing
the
d&e
procedure
if
you
performed
either
one,
because
you'd
need
less
time
for
the
dilation
in
an
emergency.
the
other
thing
i
should
point
out
is
that,
of
course,
there
is
this
question
about
what's
a
significant
risk.
and
one
thing
about
the
lethal
injection
at
the
beginning
of
the
process,
the
digoxin
injection
or
the
potassium
chloride
injection,
is
the
other
side
concedes
that
the
mother
gets
to
make
the
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
do
that
procedure.
well,
dr.
carhart
does
it
as
a
matter
of
course
after
17
weeks,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
anyone
would
suggest
that
dr.
carhart
is
needlessly
inflicting
significant
risks
on
his
patients
by
following
that
regimen
in
every
case
after
17
weeks.
and
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
the
legal
regime
that
respondents
would
construct
is
a
legal
regime
where
the
woman
can
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
that
shot,
dr.
carhart
can
decide
it
for
her
and
that's
okay,
but
congress
can't
make
the
same
judgment.
but
it's
important
to
draw
a
line
here,
and
say
that
fetal
demise
that
takes
place
in
utero
is
one
thing.
that
is
abortion
as
it
has
always
been
understood.
but
this
procedure,
the
banned
procedure
is
something
different.
this
is
not
about
fetal
demise
in
utero.
this
is
something
that
is
far
too
close
to
infanticide
for
society
to
tolerate.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
held
six
hearings
over
four
different
congresses
and
heard
from
dozens
of
witnesses
in
determining
that
partial
birth
abortions
are
never
medically
necessary,
pose
health
risks,
and
should
be
banned.
under
familiar
principles
of
deference
to
congressional
fact
finding,
those
determinations
should
be
upheld
as
long
as
they
represent
reasonable
inferences
based
on
substantial
evidence
in
the
congressional
record.
that
standard
is
amply
satisfied
here.
the
evidence
before
congress
was
clear
that
partial
birth
abortions
were
never
medically
necessary,
and
that
safe
alternatives
were
always
available
such
that
no
woman
would
be
prevented
from
terminating
her
pregnancy.
as
a
result,
congress
was
entitled
to
make
a
judgment
in
furthering
its
legitimate
interests
that
they
were
going
to
ban
a
particularly
gruesome
procedure
that
blurred
the
line
between
abortion
and
infanticide.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
this
court's
precedence,
in
particular
the
danforth
case,
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
that
piece
of
legislation,
because
in
danforth,
this
court
struck
down
an
effort
to
ban
what
was
then
the
majority
method
of
inducing
a
second
term
abortion.
and
i
think
in
the
same
way,
there
is
quite
a
different
situation
when
congress
comes
in
and
tries
to
deal
with
the
primary
abortion
method
in
the
second
trimester.
here,
though,
congress
didn't
go
after
the
dog,
so
to
speak,
it
went
after
the
tail.
this
very
aberrant
procedure,
atypical
procedure.
and
the
numbers
are
hard
to
come
by,
but
i
don't
think
anybody
suggests
that
the
d&x
procedure
is
anything
more
than
a
very
small
minority
of
second
trimester
abortions.
and
so
i
do
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
make
a
couple
of
points
in
response
to
that.
i
think...
taken
at
the
broader
level
first,
i
think
there
is
one
very
important
difference
between
these
two
procedures
that
led
congress
to
ban
one
and
allow
the
other
to
stand.
and
that
is
whether
fetal
demise
takes
place
in
utero,
which
is,
of
course,
the
hallmark
of
all
abortions,
or
whether
fetal
demise,
the
lethal
act,
takes
place
when
the
fetus
is
more
than
halfway
out
of
the
mother.
now,
as
to
their
suggestion,
i
think
most
particularly
by
respondents
in
the
second
case,
that
there
really
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
those
two
procedures.
and
with
respect,
i
just
don't
think
the
record
supports
that.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
it's
very
clear
in
the
district
court
opinion
that
you
have
some
doctors,
and
examples
would
be
plaintiff's
expert,
dr.
creinin,
or
one
of
the
nebraska
plaintiffs,
dr.
vibhakar.
they
go
in,
in
each
and
every
case,
and
try
to
perform
a
dismemberment,
or
d&e,
procedure.
and
because
they're
trying
to
perform
the
d&e
procedure,
they
need
to
dilate
the
cervix
only
modestly.
and
so
dr.
creinin,
for
example,
his
testimony
is
he
only
dilates
the
cervix
two
centimeters
or
two
and
a
half
centimeters.
now,
in
contrast,
you
have
other
doctors,
and
here
the
examples
i
would
point
to
are
two
of
the
plaintiff's
experts,
dr.
chasen
and
dr.
frederickson,
they,
in
every
single
case,
set
out
to
perform
the
d&x
procedure.
and
that
has
material
differences.
for
example,
the
dilation
regimen
that
they
use.
and
so
dr.
frederickson,
for
example,
uses
multiple
sets
of
laminaria
to
dilate
the
cervix,
and
she
gets
a
much
greater
degree
of
dilation,
5
to
6
centimeters
of
dilation.
and
of
course,
not
only
do
they
set
out
to
perform
different
procedures,
but
they,
in
fact,
perform
different
procedures.
so
the
evidence
here
again
reflects
that
dr.
vibhakar,
for
example,
in
100
percent
of
the
cases,
ends
up
performing
a
dismemberment
procedure,
or
a
d&e
procedure.
for
dr.
creinin,
it's
99
percent.
now,
by
contrast,
dr.
chasen
and--
dr.
frederickson,
when
they
set
out
to
perform
a
d&x
procedure,
they
are
successful
in
their
objective
less
often.
there
are
different
numbers
for
different
doctors,
but
it
seems
that,
at
most,
they
can
achieve
their
objective
about
a
third
of
the
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
did,
justice
kennedy,
and
in
particular,
dr.
creinin
is
an
expert.
i
think
his
deposition
was
taken,
or
his
testimony
was
taken
principally
in
the
california
case,
but
it
was
introduced
in
all
three
cases
as
part
of
the
evidentiary
record.
dr.
vibhakar
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
case.
and
dr.
chasen
and
dr.
frederickson
would
also...
their
testimony
was
in
the
record,
i
think,
in
all
three
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
you
certainly
owe
deference
to
both.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
obviously
i'm
at
a
certain
deficit
to
you
in
discussing
what
this
court
held
in
the
stenberg
opinion,
which
you
wrote.
but
my
reading
of
that
opinion
is
that
this
court
did
not
focus
on
what
was
before
the
nebraska
legislature.
but
this
court
focused
on
what
the
district
court
found.
and
in
particular,
in
the
critical
part
of
the
opinion,
which
would
be
section
2(a)
of
the
opinion,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
what
this
court
did
is
it
confronted
nebraska's
argument
that
the
d&x
procedure
was
not,
in
fact,
safer.
and
the
first
thing
this
court
did
is
said,
well,
that
argument
faces
quite
a
burden,
because
the
district
court
made
a
contrary
finding.
and
then
this
court
in
2(a)(1)
of
the
opinion
referenced
that
finding,
and
four
different
times
cited
the
district
court
record,
and
then
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
then
noted
the
various
eight
arguments
were
made
by
the
state
in
its
amici
to
the
contrary.
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it
basically
says
the
latter,
the
objections
don't
outweigh
the
former,
the
findings.
now,
i
think
if
you
compare
the
record
before
the
courts
and
before
congress,
compare
that
to
what
was
before
the
district
court
in
stenberg,
i
think
there
is
a
much
more
robust
factual
record
here.
if
you
look
at
the
stenberg
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
specifically
what
congress
found
in
that
finding
was
that
none
of
them
provided
it
as
part
of
a
curriculum.
and
i
think
what
the
record
here
clearly
reflects...
you
know,
i
don't
know
that
the
idea
of
a
curriculum...
i
don't
know
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
but
clearly,
it's
a
matter
of
what
you
teach
residents--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
if
it's
correct,
based
on
the
curriculum.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
if
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
were
overwhelmingly
to
the
contrary,
i
think
that
the
district
court
could
effectively
undermine
that
one
finding.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
anything
turned--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
would
answer
you
this
way.
you
might
first
want
to
isolate
those
situations
where,
if
the
district
court
was
addressing
something,
an
issue
that
just
wasn't
before
congress
at
all,
but
it's
somehow
relevant,
and
makes
factual
findings,
i
suppose
the
district
court
is
entitled
to
the
normal
kind
of
deference
on
review.
but
i
think
if
you
have
situations,
which
you
have
in
this
case,
where
the
district
court
heard
some
of
the
same
witnesses
who
testified
before
congress
and
before
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
makes
a
different
credibility
finding
than
the
congress
made,
i
don't
think
that's
a
basis
for
the
district
court
to
be
able
to
overcome
the
contrary
findings
of
congress.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure,
justice
stevens,
i
think
i
need
to
clarify
an
important
point
there,
which
is
to
say,
the
statute
didn't
focus
on
viable
versus
nonviable,
because
it
applies
to
both
sides
of
the
viability
line.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
there
is,
justice
stevens,
but
i
wouldn't
find
that
at
all
remarkable
in
a
statute
that
applies
and
bans
certain
procedures
without
regard
to
whether
the
procedure
is
applied
to
a
viable
or
nonviable
fetus
and
when
congress
does
make
specific
findings
that
the
procedure
it's
banning
would
have
the
effect
of
preventing
a
lethal
act
on
a
fetus
just
inches
from
being
born.
it's
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
issue
is
whether--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
the
issue
is
very
important,
because
it's
the
issue
as
to
whether
it's
going
to
be
performed
in
utero,
or
when
the
child
is
more
than
halfway
outside
of
the
womb,
and
that
of
course
corresponds--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
stevens,
again,
you're
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
could
use
either
terminology,
justice
scalia.
my
point
is,
nothing
turns
on
the
terminology.
i
mean,
the
terminology
that
congress
chose
to
use
is
a
living
fetus.
i
think
the
point,
though,
is
that
when
fetal
demise
is
induced
in
utero,
whatever
else
you
think
about
that
procedure
that
is
classically
an
abortion,
as
it
has
been
always
understood.
but
when
fetal
demise
is
induced
when
the,
when
the
living
fetus
is
over
halfway
outside
of
the
womb,
then
i
think
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
it
may
be
seconds,
it
may
be
hours;
it
depends
on...
because
even
a
pre--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
we
are
talking
about
previability
then
by
definition
chances
are
it
won't
survive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
again,
i
don't
think
that,
you
know,
that
anything
in
this
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
whether,
that's
a
fair,
that's
a
fair
summary.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
line
isn't
that
fetal
demise
has
to
be
done
before
any
delivery
begins,
but
the
basic
point
of
this
statute
is
to
draw
a
bright
line
between
a
procedure
that
induces
fetal
demise
in
utero
and
one
where
the
lethal
act
occurs
when
the
child
or
the
fetus,
whichever
you
want
to
call
it,
is
more
than
halfway
outside
of
the
mother's
womb.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
in
the
post
viability
context
it
would
clearly
be,
it
would
clearly
be
infanticide.
i
think
in
the
previability
context,
if
you
have
a
complete
delivery
but
the
child
isn't
going
to
survive,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
infanticide
to
necessarily
let
the
child
expire--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
do
think
by
contrast
if
somebody
tried
to,
with
the
fetus,
you
know,
perfectly
alive
and
in
the
hours
that
it
might
have
to
live,
if
somebody
came
in
and
ripped
its
head
open,
i
think
we'd
call
that
murder,
and
in
fact
congress
passed
another
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
ginsberg,
that's
right,
but
i
don't
think
that's
to
trivialize
congress's
interest
in
maintaining
a
bright
line
between
abortion
and
infanticide.
and
the
way
i
would
illustrate
it
is
that
line,
even
if
you
might
think
it
has
a
temporal
line,
in
the
sense
that
viability
versus
previability
is
relevant,
it
clearly
has
a
spatial
dimension
as
well
and
the
best
illustration
of
that
i
think
is
think
about
a
lawful
post
viability
abortion.
there
is
a
problem
with
the
mother's
health,
there
is
a
problem
with
her
life
so
it's
a
lawful
post
viability
abortion.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
thinks
that
the
law
is
or
should
be
indifferent
to
whether
in
that
case
fetal
demise
takes
place
in
utero
or
outside
the
mother's
womb.
the
one
is
abortion,
the
other
is
murder.
and
i
think
that
just
recognizes
that
even
in
the
post
viability
context
you
have
a
very
important
line
which
is
a
spatial
line,
and
that
line
is
basically
in
womb,
outside
of
womb,
and
what
congress
tried
to
do
in
this
statute
is
to
draw
that
line
and
differentiate
between
one
procedure
where
fetal
demise
takes
place
in
utero--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
probably
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
the
point
i
would
make
is
that
congress
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
spatial
line
between
infanticide
and
abortion,
even
with
respect
to
previability
fetuses
and
that's
true
for
at
least
two
reasons.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
the
caveat
that
the
statute
does
apply
both--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
i
think
this,
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--took
this
court's
stenberg's
decision
as
a
given--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
breyer,
here
is
the
problem
with
that
way
of
approaching
the
statute.
that
might
be
a
permissible
way
of
approaching
it
if
what
the
evidence
on
the
other
side
here
was,
that
well
you
know
there
are
cause
specific
reasons
why
you
need
this
procedure.
there
are
particular
conditions
where
you
need
this
procedure.
but
that's
not
the
evidence
on
the
other
side.
what
their
doctors
say,
the
doctors
who
perform
this
d&x
procedure,
the
dr.
chasens,
the
dr.
fredericksons,
what
they
will
tell
you
is
that
every
single
case
the
d&x
procedure
is
better
and
safer
and
they
want
to
do
it.
and
so
it
doesn't
make,
i
mean
congress
can't
pass
a
statute
that
bans
procedure
a,
and
that
ban
doesn't
apply
any
time
a
doctor
prefers
procedure
a.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
they
do
have
a
different
view
of
the
facts.
and
i
guess
the
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
this
court
rejects
the
facial
challenge
to
this
statute
it
is
still
going
to
be
open
for
litigants
in
the
future
to
try
to
identify
specific
conditions
where
this
procedure
is
the
safer
alternative.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kennedy,
what
i
think
i
have
in
mind
principally
would
be
a
preenforcement
challenge
that
was
an
as
applied
challenge.
and
what
i
have
in
mind,
you
know
that's
something
that
there
is
in
other
areas
of
the
law,
steffl
against
thompson
is
an
example.
but
what
you
would
have
in
mind
is
a
doctor
who
had
standing
under
this
court's
abortion
jurisprudence
would
come
in
and
say,
look,
in
my
practice
i've
seen
that
this
procedure
would
be
particularly
useful
in
dealing
with
preeclampsia
or
placental
previa
or
some
condition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there
is
an
effort
to
make
that
showing.
i
don't
think
that
it's
been
a
successful
effort
to
make
that
showing.
in
fact
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
findings
of
the
district
courts
in
these
cases,
two
of
the
three
district
courts
found
that
there
was
no
particular
condition
where
the
d&x
abortion
was
medically
necessary
or
had
marginal
safe
benefits...
safety
benefits.
in
this
case,
the
nebraska
case,
the
district
court
identified
only
two
conditions,
preeclampsia
combined
with
maternal
cancer,
and
placenta
previa.
and
as
to
those
particular
findings
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
problems
with
each
of
these
findings.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think,
i
mean,
they've
challenged
everything
including
every
application
of
the
statute
and
they've
tried
to
pick
off
some
particular
conditions.
what
i'm
imagining
is
in
the
future
you
might
have,
you
might
have
additional
evidence,
you
might
have
additional
experience
with
doctors,
and
they
might
come
in
and
target
their
challenge
to
particular
conditions
and
try
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg
my
understanding
is
that
even
when
you
talk
about
an
idiosyncratic
condition,
i
mean,
the
doctors
who
perform
these
abortions
perform,
you
know,
hundreds
of
them
a
year
and
they
can
identify
those
conditions
and
they
have
names
for
those
conditions
and
i
think
it
would
be
amenable
to
bringing
a
more
as
applied
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
certainly
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
this
statute,
unlike
the
nebraska
statute,
clearly
uses
an
anatomical
landmark
approach
that
is
based
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
clearly
distinguishes
between
the
d&e
procedure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
d&x
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
we
would
urge
you
to
take
any
one
of
them.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
in
fairness,
i
mean,
you
know,
we
have
an
obligation
to
defend
the
statute.
so
our
first,
you
know,
our
first
effort
would
be
to
say
we
distinguish
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
let
me
just...
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way,
which
is
our
way
of
looking
at
stenberg
is
stenberg
really
doesn't
address
what
you
do
when
there
are
congressional
findings.
and
there
is
some
tension
between
stenberg
and
turner
on
this,
because
stenberg
seems
to
suggest,
well,
when
there
is
a
doubt,
the
kind
of
doubt
that
would
normally
get
you
past
a
summary
judgment,
you
defer
to
the
doctors,
and
turner
seems
to
suggest
when
you
have
a
doubt,
conflicting
evidence,
the
kind
of
doubt
that
might
get
you
past
summary
judgment
normally,
you
defer
to
congress.
and
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
it
can't
go
both
ways,
can't
go
opposite
ways,
and
we
would
say
resolve
that
tension,
but
when
there
is
congressional
findings,
something
that
you
obviously
didn't
have
to
confront
in
stenberg,
defer
to
the
congressional
approach.
if
stenberg
means
something
contrary,
that
even
in
the
face
of
congressional
findings
that
you
have
to
defer
to
a
minority
opinion
of
doctors
and,
you
know,
kind
of
invert
what
would
normally
be
the
way
of
approaching
it,
we
think
then
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
casey,
among
others,
and
you
should
revisit
stenberg
to
that
effect,
to
that
extent.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
make
just
a
couple
of
points
in
rebuttal.
i'd
like
to
start
with
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
or
not
there
are
going
to
be
alternative
methods
available
to
end
the
pregnancy
as
a
practical
matter.
the
answer
to
that
is
there
will
always
be
an
alternative
available
as
a
practical
matter.
the
alternative
will
always
be
the
d&e
procedure,
which
the
district
court
in
this
case
called
the
gold
standard.
and
the
best
evidence
of
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
their
own
witnesses
like
dr.
chasen,
for
example,
when
they
set
out
to
perform
the
d&x
procedure,
they
are
only
successful
about
33
percent
of
the
time.
what
happens
in
the
other
67
percent
of
the
cases
is
they
actually,
even
though
they
tried
to
perform
a
d&x,
will
perform
a
d&e.
and
so
all
of
the
clinics
that
provide
d&x
also
necessarily
provide
d&e,
because
the
d&e
is
what
they
end
up
with
if
they
are
not
able
to
remove
the
fetus
intact.
so
in
every
single
case,
there
are
some,
you
know,
the
induction
procedure
has
to
be
done
in
a
hospital,
but
the
d&x
and
d&e
procedures
are
both
equally
available
in
clinics,
so
no
woman
as
either
a
theoretical
matter
or
a
practical
matter,
is
going
to
be
denied
a
safe
alternative
to
end
her
pregnancy.
i
wanted
to
pick
up
on
justice
souter's
question
as
well.
you
asked
for
factual
citations
in
the
record
on
this
dispute
between
us.
i
think
the
record
is
really
overwhelmingly
in
our
favor.
i
point
you
to
dr.
fitzhugh,
who's
one
of
the
plaintiffs
on
this
side.
135a,
he
says
he
doesn't
try
for
intact
delivery
in
every
case
because
it
would
necessitate
a
second
round
of
dilation,
a
second
round
of
laminarias,
so
he
doesn't
do
the
second
round,
he
gets
dismemberment.
dr.
knorr,
another
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
at
page
142a,
he
says
the
procedure
would
require
greater
dilation.
and
if
i
could
just
finish
on
the
citations,
dr.
vibhakar,
who
does
dismemberment
100
percent
of
the
time,
148a...
all
of
these
are
in
the
petition
appendix
of
the
district
court
opinion...
dr.
cranen
explains
his
procedure
at
174a
to
177a.
thank
you.
