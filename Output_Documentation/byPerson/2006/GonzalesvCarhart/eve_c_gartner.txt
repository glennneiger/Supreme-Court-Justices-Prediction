ms.
eve
c.
gartner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
casey,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
the
government
cannot
ban
previability
abortions.
despite
casey,
stenberg
suggested
that
there
is
a
narrow
category
of
previability
abortions,
intact
d&es,
as
this
court
understood
that
term
in
stenberg,
that
can
be
banned
so
long
as
the
ban
contains
a
health
exception.
but
i'd
like
to
leave
the
health
exception
question
aside
for
a
minute
and
turn
to
the
scope
of
the
law
that
congress
has
enacted
here.
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
enact
a
previability
abortion
ban
that
does
not
track
the
hallmark
of
intact
d&e
abortions
as
this
court
understood
that
term
in
stenberg
and
by
doing
so
to
ban
a
substantially
greater
array
of
abortions
than
would
be
banned
had
the
law
faithfully
tracked
the
language
in
the
stenberg
opinions
about
what
constitutes
an
intact
d&e.
and
i'm
referring
both
to
the
majority
opinion
in
stenberg
and
in
the
dissents.
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
must
reject
congress's
effort
to
exploit
the
limited
license
that
this
court
seemingly
granted
in
stenberg
because
to
allow
such
an
expansion
of
previability
abortions
that
can
be
banned
would
set
the
stage
for
continued
legislative
efforts
to
ban
other
iterations
of
the
classic
d&e
method
of
abortion
until
truly
there
would
be
nothing
left
at
all
of
casey's
holding
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
ban
previability
second
trimester
abortions.
the
government
in
this
case
has
conceded
that
the
act
bans
more
abortions
than
merely
the
intact
d&e
as
this
court
understood
it
in
stenberg.
but
i
want
to
highlight
for
the
court
how
the
language
of
this
act
departs
from
the
hallmarks
of
intact
d&e
and
how
these
departures
place
doctors
at
risk
of
prosecution
for
the
very
facet
of
d&e
abortions,
and
by
that
i
mean
all
d&e
abortions,
that
enhance
their
safety.
there
is
three
respects
in
which
the
act
departs
from
the
hallmarks
of
intact
d&e
as
understood
in
stenberg.
first,
the
act
does
not
require
breach
extraction
of
an
intact
fetus
to
the
head,
one
of
the
primary
hallmarks
that
this
court
understood
in
stenberg.
instead,
the
act
applies
once
the
fetus
is
extracted
past
the
navel,
a
far
more
frequent
occurrence
than
extraction
to
the
head.
and
in
fact
the
government
in
its
briefing
both
in
their
initial
brief
and
in
their
reply
concede
that
in
any
of
what
the
government
calls
standard
d&es
a
living
fetus
can
be
extracted
past
the
fetal
navel
before
demise
occurs.
in
addition,
the
act
does
not
require
the
fetus
to
be
delivered
intact
at
the
end
of
the
procedure,
another
component
of
what
is
considered
to
be
a
hallmark
of
intact
d&e
in
stenberg.
in
fact,
the
word
intact
appears
nowhere
in
the
statute
and
again
the
government
concedes
that
some
nonintact
d&es
would
violate
this
law
as
drafted.
in
fact,
the
government
contends
that
one
of
the
d&e.
and
finally,
the
act
does
not
require
that
the
fetus
be
extracted
in
a
breach
presentation
at
all,
even
though
in
stenberg
the
court
thought
of
the
breach
extraction
as
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
intact
d&e.
now
this--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--your
honor,
two,
two
doctors
in
particular,
dr.
chasen
and
dr.
hammond,
testified
that
they
have
used
in
their
practice
the
vertex
presentation
to
treat
women
who,
as
ms.
smith
indicated,
the
fetus
suffered
from
a
serious
lethal
anomaly
that
involved
a
greatly
distended
abdomen.
the
fetus
presented
in
a
head
first
presentation.
the
head
delivered
through
the
dilated
cervix,
but
the
only
way
to
complete
the
procedure
was
to
reduce
the
size
of
the,
of
the
abdomen
that
was,
that
was
anomalous
in
size
because
of
the
underlying
fetal
condition.
in
those
cases,
those
doctors
testified
that
that
was
absolutely
the
safest
way
to
terminate
the
pregnancy
for
the
woman.
the
only
alternative
way
would
have
been
abdominal
surgery,
which,
which
all
the,
virtually
all
of
the
doctors,
even
the
government's
doctors,
agreed
carries
far
greater
risks
for
the
woman
than
a
vaginal
surgical
abortion.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
two
answers,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
clear
line
that
this
court
drew
in
stenberg
was
essentially
the
line
at
intact
delivery
to
the
head
followed
by
an
act
that
results
in
fetal
demise.
very
clearly
what
this
court
understood
in
stenberg
could...
was,
was
an
intact
d&e
and
several
members
of
the
court
suggested
that
that
would
be
constitutional
to
ban.
in
addition,
the
government
today
seems
to
suggest--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
of
the
three
hallmarks
that
the
court
recognized
in
stenberg,
the
breach
delivery
is
probably
the
least,
the
least
central;
that
the
other
two
hallmarks,
the
extraction
to
the
head
followed
by
a
completely
intact
delivery
after
demise,
were
absolutely
the
hallmarks
that
everyone
on
this
court
understood
in
stenberg,
and
those,
those
lines,
are
nowhere
in
the
statute
that
congress
enacted.
today
general
clement
seems
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
a
different
line
that's
protected
in
this
statute,
a
different
line
than
the
court
recognized
in
stenberg,
and
the
line
is
about
where
the
fetus
is
when
demise
occurs.
but,
but
this
court
in
stenberg
understood
that
even
in
a
classical
d&e,
a
standard
d&e,
as
the
government
calls
it,
part
of
the
fetus
is
outside
the
woman's
uterus
when
fetal
demise
occurs.
the
court
recognized
that
fetal
demise
occurs
even
in
a
standard
d&e
when,
after
a
part
of
the
fetus
is
drawn
out
of
the
women's
uterus,
resistance
is
met,
disarticulation
occurs,
and
after
that
fetal
demise.
so
even
in
a
standard
d&e
the
line
that
the
government
today
is
offering
up,
the
line
of
inside
or
outside
the
uterus,
would
be
violated
in
any
d&e--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
absolutely,
your
honor,
that's
right.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
some
part
of
the
fetus,
no
matter
what,
is
outside
the
women's
uterus,
whether
it's
an
intact
d&e,
a
nonintact
d&e--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--i
think
the
important
point
is
that
the
government
acknowledges
that
in
a
standard
d&e,
what
it
calls
standard
d&es,
the
fetus
can
be
extracted
past
the
anatomical
landmark.
so
the
anatomical
landmark
isn't
a
bright
line
division
between
intact
d&es
and
nonintact
d&es.
but
in
stenberg
this
court
drew
that
line
between
intact
d&es
and
nonintact
d&es.
it
suggested--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--it
does
so--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--right.
it
does
so
in
two
places,
your
honor.
on
page
32
of
their
initial
brief
they
refer
to,
they
describe
two
circumstances
that
they
say
or
two
parts
of
the
law
that
they
say
saved
the
law
from
banning
nonintact
d&es.
the
first
is
the
anatomical
landmark
and
the
second
is
the
requirement
of
an
overt
act.
they
describe
the
overt
act
as
saving
nonintact
d&es
that
were
not
already
excluded
from
the
anatomical
landmark
requirement.
so
that
suggests
that
there
are
some
standard
d&es
that
would
not
be
saved
by
the
anatomical
landmark
requirement.
in
addition,
in
their
reply
brief
on
page
22
they
explicitly
say
that
the
fetus
is
usually
not
delivered
past
the
anatomic
landmark
in
the
standard
d&e,
but
they
don't
say
that
that
never
occurs.
so
they
do
admit
that
that
sometimes
is
the
case,
and
in
fact
the
government
witness,
doctor--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--well,
i
think
that's
not
how
i
understood
it,
your
honor.
but
in
addition,
the
government
witnesses,
witness,
dr.
sadigian,
admitted
that
in
any
standard
d&e
the
fetus
can
be
extracted
past
the
navel,
the
anatomic
landmark
of
the
navel,
of
the
naval,
even
in
a
standard.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
gets
to
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
safety
of
doing
abortions
in
a
way
that
would
be
banned
by
the
law,
and
that's
that
in
every
d&e,
regardless
of
whether
the
intent
is
to
do
an
intact
d&e
or
not
an
intact
d&e,
the
intent
is
to
minimize
the
insertion
of
instruments
into
the
uterus
and
to
extract
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible,
because
each
insertion
of
the
instruments
increases
the
risk
of
causing
harm
to
the
woman's
uterus.
and
so
in
every
d&e,
regardless
of
whether
the
physician
expects
to
have
an
intact
fetus
at
the
very
end
of
the
procedure,
they
do
want
to
minimize
the...
the
amount
of
instrumentation
and
bring
it
out
in
as
few
parts
as
possible
and
so
there
is
a
deliberate
and
intentional
delivery
of
the
fetus
as
far
as
possible
which
often
can
be
past
the
navel,
though
in
most
cases
it
won't
be
up
to
the
head.
so
that's
why
the
line
that
this
court
drew
in
stenberg
is
the
line
that
first
of
all
delineates
between
two
distinct
procedures,
intact
d&e
and
nonintact
d&e.
the
difference
between
those
two
procedures
is
whether
the
fetus
is
extracted
to
the
head
or
not
to
the
head
before
demise
occurs.
this,
this
statute
doesn't
draw
that
line.
it
draws
a
different
line
and
in
doing
that,
it
captures
far
more
abortions
than
the
other
law
would
and,
and
the
key
thing
is
that
if
this
law
stands
with
the
past
the
navel
line
the
inevitable
result
is
that
doctors
in
order
to
try
to
avoid
the
reach
of
this
statute
will
have
to
stop
trying
to
minimize
the
instrumentation
and
stop
trying
to
draw
the
fetus
out
as
intact
as
possible
because
often
when
that
happens--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--well,
your
honor,
i
guess
to
some
extent
it
comes
down
to
what
intent
means
but
if
what
it
means
that
the
doctors
would
prefer,
would
like
it
to
come
out
as
far
as
possible
before
they
have
to
take
any,
any
kind
of
action
to
clear
an
obstructing
part,
that's,
that's
what
they
intend.
the
doctor
only
uses
disarticulation
when
it's
necessary
to
clear
an
obstruction
because
the
continued
extraction--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--well,
two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
one
is
the
statute
makes
no
mention
of
dilation
protocols
even
though
some
group
like
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
when
they
attempted
to
define
an
intact
d&e
abortion
they've
defined
it
specifically
by
reference
to
dilation
protocols.
and
some
state
statutes
have
also
used
dilation
protocols
as
part
of
the
definition
of
intact
d&e
but
this
statute
makes
no
mention
of
dilation
protocols.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
i
think
it
would
be
relevant,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
not...
it
really
can't
be
dispositive
of
the
physician's
intent
be--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--some
doctors
use
a
one
day
protocol,
some
doctors
use
a
two
day
protocol
but
that
in
of
itself
isn't--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--because
some
doctors
use
a
two
day
protocol,
your
honor,
even
if
they
don't
expect
to
get
an
intact
d&e.
there
is
not
a
direct
correlation,
there's
some
correlation,
but
not
a
complete
correlation
between
the
amount
of
dilation
and
the
percentage
of
times
that
a
physician
achieves
intact
d&e.
to
some
extent
doctors
also
use
other
agents
to
dilate,
they
use
misoprostol
and
medication.
that
even
if
they're
doing
a
one
day
protocol--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--in
terms,
one
day
protocol?
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
some
doctors...
i
think
one
thing
is
that
doctors
perform
abortions
most
safely
when
they
do
them
in
a
way
that
they
are
most
accustomed
to.
they
are
doing
them
the
way
they
were
trained
to
do
them.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
there
is
nothing
specific
about
doctors
changing
protocols.
there
is
specific
evidence
about
increased
risks
if
doctors
were
to
stop
trying
to
extract
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible.
several
witnesses,
including
several
government
witnesses
have
agreed.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
no
actually
even
the
other
government
witness,
dr.
cook,
agreed
that...
and
the
other
government
witness,
dr.
lockwood,
agreed
that
removing
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible
in
any
d&e
is
the
safest
way
to
perform
a
d&e
procedure
regardless
of
whether
the
intent
was
to
do
an
intact
d&e
procedure.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
i
would
say
it
certainly
is
not
never
and
it's
not
always.
it's
somewhere
in
between
but
i
think--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--i
think
not
your
honor
because
the
intent
is
to
extract
the
fetus
as
intact
as
possible.
in
a
good
many
cases
it
will
be
extracted
past
the
navel
though
not
to
the
head.
so
the
doctor
falls
within
the
deliberately
and
intentionally
language
and
i
don't
think,
the
government
also
proffers
the
idea
of
specific
intent,
but
again
because
this
statute
doesn't
track
the
actual
differences
between
the
two
procedures,
the
having
the
specific
intent
doesn't
save
the
statute.
the
doctor
may
intend
to
perform
the
abortion
as
defined
in
this
law
but
not
intend
to
do
an
intact
d&e
and
that
was
the
testimony
in
these
cases.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
your
honor
there
is
testimony
in
our
case,
in
the
california
case,
that
a
few
doctors
that
testified
said
the
beginning
at
approximately
22
weeks
of
pregnancy,
they
offered
women
the
option
of
undergoing
a
fetal
demise
injection
before
the
procedure
began.
but
the
testimony
was
also
overwhelming,
including
from
the
government
witnesses,
that
that
injection
procedure
carries
significant
risks
for
some
women.
for
example,
women
with
either
susceptibility
to
infection,
like
women
with
hiv
or
hepatitis,
you
definitely
don't
want
to
do
an
additional
injection.
that
in
addition--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--it...
but
the
problem
is,
as
the
district
court
found,
it's
an
unnecessary
medical
procedure
that
subjects
the
woman
to
additional
risk.
now
if
the
doctors--
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
--at
22
weeks
and
later,
as
the
abortion
is
getting
closer
to
the
viability
line,
the
doctors
feel
that
some
women
would
feel
more...
it's
for
psychological
reasons
for
the
woman.
that's
why
it's
an
offer;
it's
not
a
requirement.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
if
she
would
prefer
that
the
fetus
undergo
demise
before
the
extraction
begins,
some
women
may
feel
better
about
that.
the
testimony
was
also
that
other
women
absolutely
don't
want
that.
and
you
know,
feel
that
they...
you
know,
it's
a
very
personal
question
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
it's
a
very
personal
decision
how
the
woman
who
has
made
this
very
difficult
moral/religious
decision
to
end
her
pregnancy,
often
for
very
tragic
reasons,
how
does
she
want
the
fetus
to
undergo
demise?
different
people
will
have
different
views
about
this.
but
here
congress
has
legislated
that
for
the
woman
and
done
so
previability,
when
the
state
interests
really
are
insufficient
to
require
the
woman
to
undergo
a
procedure
that
is
not
marginally
safer
but
significantly
safer
for
her.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
matter.
marginal
safety
would
not
be
enough
but
i
think
what
is
important
is
that
you
assess,
you
assess
the
question
of
marginal
versus
significant
by
looking
at
the
averted
harms.
it's
not
a
question
of
quantifying
how
many
women
would
avert
the
harms.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
can't
be
a
quantified,
quantified
inquiry.
ultimately
this
court
has
never
looked
at
the
constitutional
question
of
when
an
abortion
statute
interferes
with
a
woman's
health
to
an
extent
that
it's
unconstitutional,
in
terms
of
how
many
women
are
affected.
the
question
is,
is
how
seriously
would
a
woman
be
affected
if
she
is
affected?
and
the
evidence
here
is
overwhelming.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
that's.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
for
the
woman,
but
i
think
the
important
point,
your
honor,
is
that
this,
that
the
intact
d&e
procedure,
and
the
testimony
was
overwhelming
to
this
effect,
that...
in
some
cases
this
procedure
averts
catastrophic
health
consequences
for
the
woman.
it
averts
uterine
perforation,
it
averts
the
spread
of
sepsis
or
infection;
it
averts
the
spread
of...
potentially
the
spread
of
malignant
cancer
throughout
the
women's
body.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
because
what
congress
has
done
here
is
take
away
from
women
the
option
of
what
may
be
the
safest
procedure
for
her.
this
court
has
never
recognized
a
state
interest
that
was
sufficient
to
trump
the
woman's
interest
in
her
health.
if
the
woman
and
her
doctor
together
agree
that
proceeding
in
this
way
is
going
to
avert
significant
health
risks
to
her,
and
the
testimony
here
is
overwhelming
that
there
are
situations
where
that
occurs,
this
court
has
never
recognized
a
state
interest
that
was
sufficient
to
trump
that
woman's
paramount
interest
in
her
health.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
absolutely,
justice
souter.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
and
that's...
and
i
take
that...
and
maybe
that
was
my...
and
i
take
this
as
a
given
here.
given
the
overwhelming
testimony
from
doctors
from
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists,
and
this
court's
holding
in
stenberg,
where
the
record
was
less
robust,
that
we
have
that
substantial
medical
authority
here.
and
given
that
substantial
medical
authority,
doctors
need
to
be
able
to
use
their
appropriate
medical
judgment,
in
the
words
of
roe
and
casey,
to
provide
this
procedure
for
their
patients
when
in
their
judgment...
not
in
their
unfettered
discretion,
but
in
their
sound
clinical
experience
and
medical
judgment
it's
going
to
be
the
safest
for
her
and
avert
catastrophic
health
consequences.
so
this
is...
again,
it
may
be
that
the
number
of
women
affected
is
not
large,
but
for
the
women
who
are
affected
the
impact
of
this
ban
is
undoubtedly
significant.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
well,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
you
answered
that
question
as
well
as
i
could.
if
a
woman
had
to
wait
until
she
actually
needed
a
banned
abortion
for
her
health,
and
file
a
proceeding
and
wait
for
the
court
to
grant
relief,
undoubtedly
she
would
not
get
the
relief
she
needed
in
time.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
right.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
actually
understood
his
answers
though,
because
i
think
that
that's
what
we
have
here,
in
fact,
is
a
preenforcement
proceeding
to,
to
determine
that
this
law
blanketly
bans
intact
d&e
abortions
even
when
the
doctor
believes
it's,
it
would
have
significant
health
benefits
for
the
patient.
so
this
is
not,
i
want
to
go
back
to,
because
my
light
is
on,
stenberg
suggested
that
there
was
a
line
that
could
constitutionally
be
drawn
between
banned,
between
permissibly
banned
procedures
and,
and
procedures
that
have
constitutional
protection.
but
the
statute
didn't
draw
the
line
and
it
didn't
draw
that
line
in
two
ways.
this,
this
statute
defiantly
rejected
this
court's
view
that
because
there
is
substantial
medical
authority
for
the
proposition
that
intact
d&e
is
sometimes
safer,
a
health
exception
is
absolutely
needed
here,
and
they
also
refused
to
draw
the
line
at
what
this
court
understood
was
the
defining
difference
between
intact
d&e
and
nonintact
d&e.
in
the
solicitor
general's
reply
brief
they
talk
about
the
promise
of
stenberg.
well,
the
promise
of
stenberg
was
absolutely
betrayed
by
congress
in
this
case
in
both
respects,
both
in
terms
of
preserving
the
health
of
the
woman
and
allowing
her
to
use
what
a
substantial
medical
authority
thinks
is
the
safest
procedure
for
the
woman,
and
in
terms
of
holding
the
line
at
a
limited
ban
on
previability
abortions
given
that
casey
recognizes
that
women
have
a
constitutional
right
to
choose
to
end
their
pregnancy
previability.
i
was
going
to
address
briefly
some
of
the
concerns
that
the
solicitor
general
offered
about
some
of
the
health
risks
of
intact
d&e
and
cervical
incompetence.
just
briefly.
the,
all
of
the
government
witnesses
in
this
case
agreed
that
the
congressional
findings
completely
overstate
any
risks
of
intact
d&e
there
is
no,
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
to
conclude
that
intact
d&e
puts
a
woman
at
any
greater
risk
of
harm
than
standard
d&e,
and
in
fact
the
evidence
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
averts
catastrophic
health
consequences
in
some
circumstances.
there
is
no
strong
evidence
that
intact
d&e
has
any
impact
on
cervical
incompetence.
the
solicitor
general
talks
at
length
about
the
two
cases
in
dr.
jason's
study,
but
both
of
those
women
who
experienced
cervical
incompetence
had,
in
future
pregnancy,
had
had
cervical
incompetence
in
prior
pregnancies,
and
that's
a
condition
that
tends
to
stay
with
the
woman.
so
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
it
was
the
intact
d&e
itself
that
caused
cervical
incompetence
in
the
subsequent
pregnancies
because
of
intact
d&e.
and
finally,
yes,
it's
true
that
dr.
chasen
used
intact
d&e
or
attempted
to
use
intact
d&e
in
all
cases,
and
the
women
who
had
d&es,
three
of
them
suffered
very
serious
medical
consequences
after
having
a
d&e.
the
solicitor
general
says
well,
dr.
chasen
tried
to
do
intact
and
he
failed
so,
so
there
was
really
nothing
to
say
about
this
law.
but
the
fact
is,
if
this
law
went
into
effect,
no
woman
could
have
intact
d&e.
so
even
though,
even
in
those
cases
where
dr.
chasen
was
able
to
do
intact
d&e,
he
would
no
longer
be
able
to
do
that.
so
the
incidence
of
those
women
having
catastrophic
health
consequences,
which
in
the
chasen
study,
three
of
the
women
having
d&es
had
catastrophic
health
consequences.
inevitably
if
this
law
is
upheld,
an
intact
d&e
is
not
available
as
an
option
to
doctors
when
in
their
judgment
based
on
substantial
medical
authority,
it's
the
best
option
for
the
woman.
inevitably
there
will
be
more
and
more
women
having
d&es
and
suffering
catastrophic
health
consequences
in
situations
where
if
intact
d&e
had
been
available,
those
catastrophic
consequences
could
have
been
averted.
ms.
eve
c.
gartner
thank
you
for
your
consideration,
your
honor.
