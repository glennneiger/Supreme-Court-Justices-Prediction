justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
follow
up
on
a
question
the
chief
justice
asked
you
during
the
last
argument?
we
got
into
the
government's
construction
of
the
statute
to
narrow
it
to
intentional
situations.
would
you
explain
a
little
more
exactly
what
situations
you
would
exclude
and
what
you
would
include
in
your
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
measure
the
mens
rea
at
the
outset
of
the
procedure
when
they
begin
the
dilation
a
day
or
two
before
the
actual
operation
is
performed,
or
is
it
at
the
time
of
beginning
the
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement,
that
brings
up
a
question
i
was
intending
to
ask
you.
i
notice
the
finding
says
nothing
about
interstate
commerce
but
the
statute
says
any
physician
who
in
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
performs
the
procedures.
does
that
mean
that
the
procedure
is
performed
in
a
free
clinic,
as
opposed
to
a
profit
organization,
it
would
not
be
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
could
the
commerce
clause
justify
application
to
a
free
clinic?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
activities
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
clear
up
one
thing
for
me?
you
say
it's
always
the
doctor's
intent
to
extract
as
much
as
possible
before
causing
fetal
demise.
i
thought
there
was
significant
number
of
cases
in
which
there
was
a
deliberate
decision
to
cause
fetal
demise
before
i
start
doing
any
extraction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
doctor
it
would
be
the
safest
thing
to
avoid
criminal
responsibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
answer
to
my
question
turn
largely
on
the
age
of
the
fetus?
isn't
it
a
vast
difference
between
the
kind
of
decision
the
mother
has
to
make
if
it's
a
14
week
fetus
on
the
one
hand
and
26
week
fetus
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
one
of
the
congressional
interests
described
in
the
finding
is
avoiding
fetal
pain
to
the
fetus.
and
i
guess
they
don't
suffer
any
pain
prior
to
20
weeks
but
after
20
weeks
there
is
some
risk
of
pain.
and
that
seems
to
me,
that
could
affect
a
calculus
very
dramatically
for
the
woman
making
the
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement,
are
not
some
of
the
findings
by
congress
clearly
erroneous?
for
example,
there
is
a
statement
that
no
current
medical
schools
provide
instruction
in
the
procedure.
now
that's
clearly
wrong,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
finding
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
introduced
in
the
district
court
that
there
were
schools
like
yale
and
new
york
university
that
did
include
this
as
part
of
a
curriculum,
could
the
district
court
disregard
that
finding
and
make
a
contrary
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
other
findings,
is
there
a
different
standard
of
review
of
what
the
district
court
found
as
opposed
to
what
congress
found?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand--
congress
to
have
made
credibility
findings.
as
i
read
the...
i
read
the
whole
finding.
there
were
six
or
seven
pages
of
findings,
and
i
don't
find
a
single
reference
in
those
findings
to
the
performance
of
an
abortion
on
a
nonviable
fetus.
all
of
the
language
in
the
findings
seem
to
be
referring
to
viable
fetuses
just
inches
away
from
becoming
a
person.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
even
find
the
word
fetus
in
those
findings.
the
findings
as
opposed
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
findings.
is
there
a
single
word
in
the
findings
that
refers
to
a
viable
fetus?
it
maybe
refers
to
a
nonviable
fetus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
preventing,
it's
requiring
that
the
lethal
act
be
performed
prior
to
any
part
of
the
delivery,
because
there
is
no
doubt
there
will
be
a
lethal
act.
the
only
issue
is
when
it
may
be
performed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
the
fetus
is
more
than
halfway
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
the
fetus
is
more
than
halfway
out,
and
some
of
these
fetuses
i
understand
in
the
procedure,
are
only
four
or
five
inches
long.
they
are
very
different
from
fully
formed
babies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
the
fetus
be...
i
think
it
suffer
a
demise
in
seconds
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
not
agree
that
it
has
no
chance
of
surviving,
in
most
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
it
is
far
preferable
to
ensure
that
fetal
demise
takes
place
before
any
delivery
begins.
that's
the
big
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
what
you
think
we
should
do.
if
i
thought
the
evidence
did
support
the
conclusion
that
it's
never
medically
necessary,
it
merely...
the
evidence
merely
supports
the
proposition
that
a
doctor
has
to
be
a
lot
more
careful
if
he
goes
one
way
rather
than
the
other
because
there
are
more
risks
involved
in
one
procedure
rather
than
the
other,
would
that
be
sufficient
to
support
the...
i
can
see
the
argument
that
the
intact
delivery
may
have
less
risk
of
complications
and
so
forth
without
it
not
necessarily
being
absolutely
necessary.
