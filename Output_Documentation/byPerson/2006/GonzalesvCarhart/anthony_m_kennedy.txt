justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
question
is
the
same
as
justice
breyer's.
is
there
anything
in
the
literature,
including
medical
literature,
that
talks
about
significant
or
minor
risks?
i
mean,
you
fill
out
forms
when
you
go
to
the
dentist
about
risks.
now,
if...
if
the
chance
of
death
is
one
out
of
100,
is
that
significant?
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there
is
a
risk
if
the
uterine
wall
is
compromised
by
cancer
or
some
forms
of
preeclampsia
and
it's
very
thin,
there's
a
risk
of
being
punctured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
doctor
has
the
intent,
the
good
faith
intent
to
perform
a
standard
in
utero
d&e,
and
he
knows
because
of
what's
happened
in
the
last
three
months,
with
women
with
this
particular
shaped
fetus
and
particular
position
of
the
fetus,
that
the
chances
are
50
percent,
60
percent
that
it's
going
to
be
an
intact
delivery,
at
which
point
he
is
presented
with
the
problem.
does
he
have
the
prohibitive
intent?
because
aren't
you,
don't
you
have
an
intent
to
commit
the,
most
likely
consequences
of
your
acts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
important
to
me
because
you
seem
to
think
that
there
is
a
standard
d&e.
in
reading
the
medical
testimony
it
seemed
to
me
that
d&es
ought
to
result
in
result
in
intact
deliveries
quite
without
the
intent
of
the
doctor.
now
maybe
that's
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
address
the
question
i
asked
respondent's
counsel
in
the
last
case
about
the
availability
of
other
facilities?
because
there
are
alternate
methods
but
some
of
these
require
hospitalization,
and
my
understanding
is
the
hospitals
aren't
always
open.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
say
well,
there
is
an
alternate
procedure
if
you
can't
be
admitted
to
the
facility.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
pin
your
whole
case
on
the
availability
of
d&e
even
though
d&es
sometimes
inadvertently
turn
into
intact
d&es.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
understand
the
government's
argument
or
answer
to
that
to
be,
well,
if
the
intent
did
not
exist,
if
there
was
not
an
intent
to
do
that,
then
the
doctor
is
not
liable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
want
to
misinterpret
the
attorney
general,
the
solicitor
general's
remarks
but
he
indicated
in
those
case
there
could
be
an
as
applied
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
answer
that
the
solicitor
gave...
general
gave
to
that
was,
you
could
have
a
preenforcement
proceeding.
that
you
can
back
up
the
clock.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
didn't
those
doctors
testified
in
the
congressional
hearings
or
in
the
eighth
circuit
or
ninth
circuit
or
the
second
circuit?
there
are
so
many
doctors
here.
which
are
the
two
that
you're
referring
to
that
do
not
dilate
the
cervix
fully?
did
they
testify
in
any
of
the
district
court
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
a
hypothetical
instance
in
which
an
as
applied
challenge
could
be
brought
if
we
sustain
the
statute
on
its
face?
the
procedure
has
to
take
place
within
24,
48,
72
hours.
how
would
as
applied
challenge
take
place?
and
i
have
read
all
the
doctors'
testimony
in
this
case
in
this
case,
hundreds
of
pages,
and
i'm
familiar
with
the
area
generally.
but
it
takes
a
while
to
get
up
to
speed.
i
don't
know
if
you
could
just
go
to
a
district
judge
and
say
i
need
an
order,
the
judge
would
take...
would
have
to
take
many
hours
to
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
that
already
in
the
record,
then,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
eighth
circuit,
in
the
district
courts,
proceedings
in
those
circuits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general
clement,
i'm
just
thinking,
trying
to
imagine
how
an
as
applied
challenge
would
be
really
much
different
from
what
we
have
seen
already.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me...
i
didn't
find
it
in
the
materials.
maybe
the
statistics
aren't
available.
in
the
cases
where
intact
d&e
or
d&xs
are
performed
in
the
period
i
guess,
what,
16
through
20,
21st,
22nd
weeks,
in
how
many
of
those
instances,
do
you
have
any
idea,
in
how
many
of
those
instances
is
there
serious
health
risk
to
the
mother
that
requires
the
procedure
as
opposed
to
simply
being
an
elective
procedure?
are
there
any
statistics
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
have
just
other
question
that's
generally
related
to
the
first.
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
that
other
procedures
or
alternate
procedures
are
available,
alternate
to
d&x,
alternate
to
intact
d&e,
is
your
response
that,
although
they're
available
as
a
matter
of
science,
as
a
matter
of,
of
medical
expertise,
they
are
not
available
because
hospitals
don't
allow
the
patients
to
be
admitted?
i
was
going
to
ask
that
same
question
to
the
government,
because
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
that
certain
hospitals
just
don't
admit
patients
for
this
purpose,
which
is...
goes
back
to
my
earlier
question.
i
was
wondering
if
that's
because
it's
sheerly
elective.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it's
purely
elective
and
not
medically
necessary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
might
be
related
in
the
sense
that
the
government's
argument
that
there
are
alternate
mechanisms
is
not
a
practical
alternative.
i
was
going
to
ask
the
government
about
that.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
any
number
of
hospitals
don't
allow
the
procedure
is
also
indicated,
indication
that
there
is
a
medical
opinion
against
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
was
wondering,
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose,
this
might
help,
suppose
the
physician
testifies
that
i
wanted
to
do
a
nonintact,
an
in
utero
d&e,
that
that's,
that
was
my
intent,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
do,
that's
what
i
always
want
to
do.
in
this
case
i
had
an
intact
delivery
and
had
no
other
choice.
are
you
saying
that
we
could
interpret
the
statute
to
say
that
that
is
not
the
prohibited
criminal
intent,
he
is
immune
from
prosecution
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
give
me
one
instance
in
which
your
proposed
interpretation
would
work
in
the
real
world.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
on
that
last
point,
i
mean,
we
are
interested
of
course
in
different
interpretations,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
your
interpretation
would
have
very
little
practical
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
that
there
is
always
a
constitutional
right
to
use
what
the
physician
thinks
is
the
safest
procedure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
inferred
that
from
your
comments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then,
you
think
there
are
instances
in
which
the
state
can
require
that
a
procedure
be
used,
even
if
it's
not
the
safest
procedure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then,
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
obverse
of
the
proposition
i
put
at
first,
it
must
be
true
that
there
are
some
instances
in
which
the
state
can
prohibit
a
procedure
even
if
it
is
the
safest
procedure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
cases
just
been
announced
by
the
chief
justice
require
us
to
consider
that
the
validity
of
a
federal
statute
regulates
abortion
procedures
is
been
held
invalid
and
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits.
the
act
is
called
the
partial-birth
abortion
ban
act
of
2003.
the
principle
challenges
to
the
act
are
first
that
it
is
void
for
vagueness.
second,
that
it
poses
an
undue
burden
because
it
prohibits
the
most
common
second
trimester
abortion
methods
and
third
that
it
has
no
exception
proving
the
health
of
the
mother
is
at
risk.
we
know
from
recitations
in
the
preamble
of
the
act
enacted
by
the
congress
that
the
legislation
was
in
response
to
the
invalidation
of
a
somewhat
similar
statute
enacted
by
the
state
of
nebraska.
the
earlier
state
statute
was
invalidated
by
this
court
in
stenberg
versus
carhart.
the
federal
statute
now
the
force
is
more
specific
concerning
the
instances
to
which
it
applies
so
let
us
more
precise.
a
premise
central
to
the
joint
opinion
in
planned
parenthood
versus
casey
was
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
and
substantial
interest
in
promoting
fetal
life
that
premise
would
be
repudiated
were
we
to
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
we
reverse.
as
the
court
did
in
stenberg
it
is
necessary
in
the
opinion
to
explain
a
nature
of
abortion
procedures
used
in
the
second
trimester
or
even
in
later
term
abortions.
these
matters
are
discussed
in
the
opinion
at
some
length
and
will
not
be
rehearsed
again
here.
the
two
principle
methods
discussed
are
the
dilation
and
evacuation
of
the
so
called
d&e
method
and
a
variation
of
that
procedure.
now
the
variation
has
a
different
descriptions
attached
to
it,
we
refer
to
it
in
the
opinion
as
some
doctors
do
as
intact
d&e.
in
the
federal
statute
the
act
prohibits
intact
d&e.
we
conclude
the
act
does
not
void
for
vagueness
or
over
brought
the
act
does
not
apply
unless
the
doctor
has
the
intent
or
the
outset
both
one,
to
deliver
a
fetus
to
certain
anatomical
landmarks
and
two
to
commit
an
additional
overact
other
than
completion
of
delivery
that
kills
the
partially
delivered
fetus.
these
objectives
standards
provide
doctors
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
know
what
is
prohibited.
we
find
the
act
does
not
impose
an
undo
burden
by
reason
of
its
lack
of
an
exception
for
protecting
women’s
health.
there
is
documented
medical
disagreement
whether
the
act’s
probation
would
ever
impose
significant
health
risk
on
the
woman.
the
court
has
given
state
and
federal
legislatures
in
other
cases
wide
discretion
to
pass
legislation
in
areas
where
this
medical
and
scientific
uncertainty
exist,
physicians
are
not
entitled
to
ignore
regulations
that
direct
them
to
use
reasonable
alternative
procedures.
medical
uncertainty
does
not
foreclose
the
exercise
of
legislative
power
in
the
abortion
context
anymore
than
it
does
in
other
context.
our
decision
in
stenberg
was
interpreted
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
leave
no
margin
of
error
for
legislatures
to
act
in
the
face
of
medical
uncertainty.
but
a
zero
tolerance
policy
would
strike
down
legitimate
abortion
regulations
like
the
present
one.
if
some
part
of
the
medical
community
would
disincline
to
follow
the
prescription
and
this
is
too
exacting
a
standard.
now
it
is
objected
that
the
intact
d&e
is
little
different
from
standard
d&e
so
that
the
act
accomplishes
little.
the
act’s
purposes
demonstrate
to
us
that
the
legislature
was
justified
and
concluding
that
the
procedure
should
be
prohibited.
the
act
prescribes
a
method
of
abortion
in
which
a
fetus
is
killed
just
inches
before
completion
of
the
birth
process.
by
prohibiting
that
procedure
the
act
expresses
respect
for
the
dignity
of
human
life.
the
government
also
has
an
interest
in
regulating
the
medical
profession
and
protecting
its
integrity
and
ethics.
a
central
premise
of
the
polarity
opinion
in
casey
versus
planned
parenthood
was
that
the
court’s
precedence
in
roe
and
cases
immediately
following
roe
had
undervalued
the
states
interest
in
potential
human
life.
in
casey
the
controlling
opinion
indicated
that
a
law
which
serves
a
valid
purpose
cannot
be
declared
void
even
if
it
has
the
incidental
effect
of
making
it
more
difficult
and
more
expensive
to
procure
an
abortion.
the
premise
that
state
from
the
inception
of
pregnancy
maintains
its
own
regulatory
interest
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
fetus
that
may
become
a
child
cannot
be
set
at
naught
by
interpreting
casey’s
requirement
of
the
health
exception
so
it
becomes
tantamount
to
allowing
the
doctor
to
choose
the
abortion
method
he
or
she
might
prefer.
respect
for
human
life
finds
an
ultimate
expression
in
the
bond
of
love
the
mother
has
for
her
child.
the
act
recognizes
this
reality
as
well.
whether
to
have
an
abortion
requires
a
difficult
and
painful
moral
decision.
while
we
find
no
reliable
data
to
measure
the
phenomena
it
does
seem
unexceptional
to
conclude
that
some
women
come
to
regret
their
choice
to
abort
the
infant
life
they
once
created
and
sustained.
it
is
self
evident
that
a
mother
who
comes
to
regret
her
choice
to
abort
must
struggle
with
grief
more
anguish
than
sorrow
more
propound.
when
she
learns
only
after
the
event,
at
the
event,
what
once
she
did
not
know
that
she
allowed
a
doctor
to
pears
the
skull
and
vacuum
the
fast
developing
brain
of
her
unborn
child,
the
child
assuming
human
form.
the
states
interest
in
respect
for
life
is
advanced
by
the
dialogue
that
better
informs
the
political
and
legal
systems,
the
medical
profession,
expectant
mothers
and
society
as
a
whole
of
the
consequences
that
follow
up
from
a
decision
to
elect
a
late
term
abortion.
so
we
hold
the
act
does
not
invalid
on
his
face
the
consideration
we
have
discussed
support
our
further
determination
that
the
facial
attacks
in
these
cases
should
not
have
been
entertained
by
the
courts
in
the
first
instance.
the
proper
means
to
consider
a
exception
is
by
as
applied
challenge.
this
is
the
proper
manner
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman
if
it
can
be
shown
that
indiscreet
and
well
defined
instances
a
particular
condition
has
or
as
likely
to
occur
in
which
the
procedure
prohibited
by
the
act
must
be
used
and
as
applied
challenge
the
nature
of
the
medical
risk
can
be
better
quantified
and
balanced
that
in
the
facial
attack.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
we
also
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion

justice
scalia
has
joined.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion

have

principle
methods
discussed
are
the
dilation
and
evacuation
of
the
so
called
d&e
method
and
a
variation
of
that
procedure.
now
the
variation
has
a
different
descriptions
attached
to
it,
we
refer
to
it
in
the
opinion
as
some
doctors
do
as
intact
d&e.
in
the
federal
statute
the
act
prohibits
intact
d&e.
we
conclude
the
act
does
not
void
for
vagueness
or
over
brought
the
act
does
not
apply
unless
the
doctor
has
the
intent
or
the
outset
both
one,
to
deliver
a
fetus
to
certain
anatomical
landmarks
and
two
to
commit
an
additional
overact
other
than
completion
of
delivery
that
kills
the
partially
delivered
fetus.
these
objectives
standards
provide
doctors
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
know
what
is
prohibited.
we
find
the
act
does
not
impose
an
undo
burden
by
reason
of
its
lack
of
an
exception
for
protecting
women’s
health.
there
is
documented
medical
disagreement
whether
the
act’s
probation
would
ever
impose
significant
health
risk
on
the
woman.
the
court
has
given
state
and
federal
legislatures
in
other
cases
wide
discretion
to
pass
legislation
in
areas
where
this
medical
and
scientific
uncertainty
exist,
physicians
are
not
entitled
to
ignore
regulations
that
direct
them
to
use
reasonable
alternative
procedures.
medical
uncertainty
does
not
foreclose
the
exercise
of
legislative
power
in
the
abortion
context
anymore
than
it
does
in
other
context.
our
decision
in
stenberg
was
interpreted
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
leave
no
margin
of
error
for
legislatures
to
act
in
the
face
of
medical
uncertainty.
but
a
zero
tolerance
policy
would
strike
down
legitimate
abortion
regulations
like
the
present
one.
if
some
part
of
the
medical
community
would
disincline
to
follow
the
prescription
and
this
is
too
exacting
a
standard.
now
it
is
objected
that
the
intact
d&e
is
little
different
from
standard
d&e
so
that
the
act
accomplishes
little.
the
act’s
purposes
demonstrate
to
us
that
the
legislature
was
justified
and
concluding
that
the
procedure
should
be
prohibited.
the
act
prescribes
a
method
of
abortion
in
which
a
fetus
is
killed
just
inches
before
completion
of
the
birth
process.
by
prohibiting
that
procedure
the
act
expresses
respect
for
the
dignity
of
human
life.
the
government
also
has
an
interest
in
regulating
the
medical
profession
and
protecting
its
integrity
and
ethics.
a
central
premise
of
the
polarity
opinion
in
casey
versus
planned
parenthood
was
that
the
court’s
precedence
in
roe
and
cases
immediately
following
roe
had
undervalued
the
states
interest
in
potential
human
life.
in
casey
the
controlling
opinion
indicated
that
a
law
which
serves
a
valid
purpose
cannot
be
declared
void
even
if
it
has
the
incidental
effect
of
making
it
more
difficult
and
more
expensive
to
procure
an
abortion.
the
premise
that
state
from
the
inception
of
pregnancy
maintains
its
own
regulatory
interest
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
fetus
that
may
become
a
child
cannot
be
set
at
naught
by
interpreting
casey’s
requirement
of
the
health
exception
so
it
becomes
tantamount
to
allowing
the
doctor
to
choose
the
abortion
method
he
or
she
might
prefer.
respect
for
human
life
finds
an
ultimate
expression
in
the
bond
of
love
the
mother
has
for
her
child.
the
act
recognizes
this
reality
as
well.
whether
to
have
an
abortion
requires
a
difficult
and
painful
moral
decision.
while
we
find
no
reliable
data
to
measure
the
phenomena
it
does
seem
unexceptional
to
conclude
that
some
women
come
to
regret
their
choice
to
abort
the
infant
life
they
once
created
and
sustained.
it
is
self
evident
that
a
mother
who
comes
to
regret
her
choice
to
abort
must
struggle
with
grief
more
anguish
than
sorrow
more
propound.
when
she
learns
only
after
the
event,
at
the
event,
what
once
she
did
not
know
that
she
allowed
a
doctor
to
pears
the
skull
and
vacuum
the
fast
developing
brain
of
her
unborn
child,
the
child
assuming
human
form.
the
states
interest
in
respect
for
life
is
advanced
by
the
dialogue
that
better
informs
the
political
and
legal
systems,
the
medical
profession,
expectant
mothers
and
society
as
a
whole
of
the
consequences
that
follow
up
from
a
decision
to
elect
a
late
term
abortion.
so
we
hold
the
act
does
not
invalid
on
his
face
the
consideration
we
have
discussed
support
our
further
determination
that
the
facial
attacks
in
these
cases
should
not
have
been
entertained
by
the
courts
in
the
first
instance.
the
proper
means
to
consider
a
exception
is
by
as
applied
challenge.
this
is
the
proper
manner
to
protect
the
health
of
the
woman
if
it
can
be
shown
that
indiscreet
and
well
defined
instances
a
particular
condition
has
or
as
likely
to
occur
in
which
the
procedure
prohibited
by
the
act
must
be
used
and
as
applied
challenge
the
nature
of
the
medical
risk
can
be
better
quantified
and
balanced
that
in
the
facial
attack.
we
reverse
the
judgment
