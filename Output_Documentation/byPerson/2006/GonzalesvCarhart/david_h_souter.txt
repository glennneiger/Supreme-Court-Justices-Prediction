justice
david
h.
souter
miss
gartner,
with
respect
to
your
argument
that
the
statute
here
did
not
track
what
you
have
described
as
the
characteristics,
the
hallmarks,
i
think
the
answer
from
the
other
side
is
that
the,
the
theory
of
this
statute
is
a
theory
of
a
clear
line
between
a
legitimate
abortion
and
infanticide.
and
if
that
is
the
theory,
then
whether
it's
a
breach
delivery
or
a
nonbreach
delivery
is
irrelevant.
what
would
your
answer
be
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
said
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
line.
but
the
question
here
is
is
it
really
essential
to
an
appropriate
line
that
we
talk,
that
we
describe
it
as
a,
as
a
breach
delivery
or
a
nonbreach
delivery.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
dilation
protocol
certainly
would
be
relevant
on
the
question
of
intent
which
this
statute
does
refer
to,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
telling
us
that
some
do
this
and
some
do
that
and
the
question
is
why
wouldn't
following
one
protocol
rather
than
another
protocol
very
significant
evidence
of
what
was
intended?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
any
indication
in
the
record
in
your
case
about
the
effect
on
safety
of
any
other
aspect
of
this
procedure
if
these
doctors
would
change
their,
their
method
of
operation
and
go
to
a
one
day
protocol?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
want
to
cut
your
answer
but
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anything
specifically
in
the
record
in
your
case
that
bears
on
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
mean
stop
when
they
have
started
with
a
different
intent?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
opposed
to
adopting
a
completely
different
procedure
entirely...
a
different
protocol
entirely.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
we
have...
we
have
said
that
that
judgment
has
to
reflect
some
kind
of
substantial
medical
judgment.
it
can't
be
an
idiosyncratic
determination
by
one
doctor
alone.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
to
that
extent--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
quite
independent
of
the
anatomical
approach
that
the
health
exception
is
denied?
i
mean
that's
an...
that
does
not
depend
on
the
anatomical
approach.
the
anatomical
approach
may
be
well
be
an
answer
at
the
facial
challenge
stage,
to
problems
of
vagueness,
for
example.
but
the
health
exception
problem
is
not
affected
by
that.
and
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
your
argument
that
somehow
the
health
exception
issue
should
be
left
to
an
as
applied
challenge
is
the
statement
in
stenberg,
and
it's
on
938.
i'm
quoting
"but
where
substantial
medical
authority
supports
the
proposition
that
banning
a
particular
abortion
procedure
could
endanger
women's
health,
casey
requires
the
statute
to
include
a
health
exception
where
the
procedure
is
necessary
in
appropriate
medical
judgment
for
the
preservation....
"
--excuse
me...
"of
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother.
"
now,
your
position,
it
seems
to
me,
requires
us
to
do
one
of
three
things.
either
we,
we
overrule
stenberg
in
that
respect,
or
we,
we
find...
i
don't
know
how
but
we
might
find,
well,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
substantial
medical
authority,
and
therefore
on
the
face
of
the
statute
there
seems
to
be
no
impediment
in
the
stenberg
statement.
or
three,
we
say
well,
there
seems
to
be
a
tension
between
the
showing
of
substantial
medical
authority
which
occurred
in
the
litigation
in
these
cases
and
the
findings
made
by
congress,
and
under
those
circumstances
in
effect
we
are
required
to
ignore
the
record
in
the
cases
and
go
with
congress's
apparently
contrary
judgment.
which
of
the
three
do
we
take?
justice
david
h.
souter
take
all
three.
[laughter]
no,
but
seriously--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
the
problem,
i
guess...
focus
the
problem
this
way.
the,
the
stenberg
opinion
talks
about
substantial
medical
authority
as
triggering
this
requirement
for
a
statutory
element.
that
problem
is
not
focused
simply
by
saying
congress
made
some
findings
and
the
district
court
made
other
findings
and
congress
should
prevail.
the
fact
is
the
substantial
medical
judgment
finding
i
would
suppose
is
satisfied
by
the,
by
the
record
in
the
district
courts
in
these
cases.
this
is
not
one
doctor's
idiosyncratic
judgment
and
a
court
could
reasonably
find,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
substantial
medical
judgment.
if
we
are
going
to
defer,
as
you
say
we
should
defer
to
congress,
haven't
we
got
to
overrule
that
statement?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
to
focus
on
one
particular
problem
that
i
think
is
implicated
by
justice
ginsburg's
question.
if
i
understood
you
correctly
a
moment
ago,
and
i
think
this
is
in
your
briefs
too,
you
said
that
the
definitional
problem
is
that
doctors
always
set
out
to
do
an
intact
procedure
if
they
can,
because
it
involves
less
risk
to
the
mother
from,
from
acts
performed
inside.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
would
be,
i
guess
in
the
real
world,
very
difficult
for
congress
to
define
a
difference
between
d&e
and
d&x,
because
the
intention
is
always,
as
you
understand
it,
to
have
an
intact
result.
your
brother
on
the
other
side,
the
solicitor
general
says
there
certainly
is
testimony
to
the
effect
that
that
is
not
so.
that
doctors
who
intend
to
perform
a
d&e
simply
intend
at
the
beginning
to
have
a
lesser
degree
of
dilation
which
will
force
them
to
do
the
d&e
and
not
have
a
totally
intact
procedure.
would
you
comment
on
what
i
think
is
the
factual
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
could
you
start
simply
with
the
factual
predicate
for
your
argument
and
his
argument.
you
seem
to
be
starting
from,
if
i
understand
the
two
of
you
correctly,
you
seem
to
be
starting
from
basically
different
factual
assumptions.
could
you,
could
you
start
by
commenting
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
may
not
be
able
to
control
it
in
an
absolute
sense,
but
can't
they
go
about
it
in
a
way
that
would
tend
to
produce
less
rather
than
more
dilation?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
can't
guarantee
results,
but
couldn't
they
at
least
start
with
a,
i
don't
know
how
you
put
it,
a
procedure
that
would
be
likely
to
produce
less
rather
than
more,
and
hence
come
within
the
safe
harbor,
if
you
will,
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
they
don't,
but
my
question
is,
can
they?
and
the
record
may
not
show
this.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
answer
the
impossible,
but
do
we
have
evidence
that
would
indicate
that
they
can
or
that
they
can't?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
tell
us
where
to
look
in
the
record
for
the
evidence
on
that?
