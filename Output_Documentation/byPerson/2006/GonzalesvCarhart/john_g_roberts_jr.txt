chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
we'll
hear
argument
in
05-1382,
gonzales
versus
planned
parenthood
federation
of
america.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
gather
your
submission
is
that
we
can
tell
who
is
setting
out
to
perform
which,
by
the
dilation
protocol.
those
were
the
record
references
that
you
gave
earlier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
miss
gartner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you...
i
think
this
question
was
asked
earlier,
but
i
want
your
position.
how
often
does
the
vertex
delivery
occur
in
a
d&x
procedure?
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understood
the
statute
here
to
apply
only
when
the,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
that
the
partially
delivered
infant
is
killed
after
passing
the
anatomical
landmark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
just
say
your
hypothetical
about
extraction
of
the
leg
it
seems
to
be
would
not
be
covered
by
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
the
government
concede
that
in
a
standard
d&e
the
living
fetus
is
extracted
past
the
anatomical
landmark?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
was...
i
thought
their
position
was
that
that
was
not
the
standard
d&e.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
their
answer
on
that
was
that
sometimes
the
d&e
procedure
will
lead
to
a
d&x
procedure,
but
that
the
requirement
of
deliberately
and
intentionally
removes
those
situations
from
the
scope
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
prior
to
demise?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
concern
with
your
argument
is
it's
not
just
the
anatomical
line.
the
statute,
i
guess
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
this
as
the
multiple
mens
rea
requirement.
it's
not
simply
the
extraction
to
a
particular
anatomical
landmark
but
with
the
purpose
of
demise
at
that
point.
so,
if
in
the
typical
d&e
the
demise
is
going
to
be
accomplished
before
extraction
passed
the
anatomical
landmark.
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
this
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the--
solicitor
general's
reference
with
respect
to
the
differing
protocols
on
dilation
which
suggests
a
different
intent
going
into
the
procedure
for
the
d&e
and
d&x?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
the
doctors
in
that
case
propose
that
option
to
their
patients?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what...
what
are
the
psychological
reasons?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
is
there
a
difference
between,
in
your
view,
in
the
constitutionality,
marginally
safer
and
significantly
safer?
in
other
words,
i
take
it
we
don't,
you
obviously
were
here
for
the
discussion
in
the
prior
case.
we
don't
have
evidence
on
marginal
significant.
and
do
you
think
it
matters;
if
in
fact
it's
a
marginal
difference
in
safety,
does
that,
is
that
still
enough
to
override
congress's
interests
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
do
we
just
look
at
the
averted
harms,
or...
or
do
we,
or
congress,
also
look
at
the
incidence
of
the
averted
harms?
is
it
a
theoretical...
is
it
a
theoretical
inquiry
or
is
it
to
some
extent
a
quantified
inquiry?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if...
if
the
woman
can
take
into
account
the
impact
on
the
fetus
at
a
certain
point
in
time,
and
your
option,
as
you
said
some
physicians
give,
of
fetal
demise
prior
to
the
procedure,
why
is
that
beyond
the
scope
of
things
that
congress
can
take
into
account?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
gartner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
clement,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
05-380,
gonzales
vs.
carhart.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
do
you
understand
the
scope
of
this
statute
to
be
different
than
the
scope
of
the
statute
at
issue
in
stenberg,
focusing
in
particular
on
the
deliberate
and
intentional
language?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
miss
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
no
evidence
either
in
the
record
before
the
court
or
congress
as
to
how
often
that
situation
arises?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
give
you
an
extra
30
seconds.
proceed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
that
gets
back
to
the
point
earlier.
i
mean,
do
you
agree
with
the
discussion
earlier
that
this
act
is
not
going
to
prevent
abortions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
degree
of
marginal
impact
on
safety
do
you
think
is
necessary
to
override
the
state's
interest?
i
mean,
if
you
have
complications
under
the
d&e
procedure
in
say
10
percent
of
the
cases,
complications
under
d&x
in
9.99
percent
of
the
case
s,
is
that
marginal
benefit
in
safety
enough
to
override
the
state's
articulated
interest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
your
submission
earlier
is
that
we
don't
have
any
record
evidence
about
how
often
the
complications
arise,
so
it's
hard
to
get
a
handle
on
exactly
what
the
difference
is
in
terms
of
safety
under
your
submission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
evidence
was
that
you're
looking
for
a
different
degree
of
dilation
if
you're
intending
to
perform
d&e
than
if...
and
you're
looking
for
a
greater
degree
if
you're
intending
to
perform
a
d&x.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
submission
that
there
aren't
dilation
protocols
if
you're
intending
a
d&e
and
if
you're
intending
a
d&x,
they're
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
the,
on
the
same
issue
i
think,
that
the
addition
of
the
deliberately
and
intentionally
language
in
the
congressional
act
addresses
that
concern?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
just
one
thing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
statute,
of
course,
refers
to
both
feet
first
and
vertex
deliveries.
how
common
is
the
vertex
delivery
in
the
d&x?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
giving
your
arguments
toward
the
safety
benefits
of
the
d&x,
i
couldn't
understand
why
they
wouldn't
also
apply
to
the
total
delivery
of
the
fetus
in
a
vertex
delivery
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
the
vertex,
the
skull
and
head
are
already
outside
the
mother.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
objection
in
the
feet
first
is
that
you
want
fewer
instrument
passes
and
so
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
that
case,
it's
not
the
skull
itself
that
is
preventing
the
delivery
of
the
fetus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
arguments
about
why
the
d&x
is
safer
than
feet
first,
wouldn't
that
apply
in
the
case
of
total
delivery
of
the
fetus
as
well?
in
other
words,
if
you
want
as
much
of
the
fetus
intact
and
out
as
possible,
why
wait,
stop
it
halfway?
wouldn't
the
safety
argument
suggest
delivery
of
the
fetus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
case
of
a
vertex
delivery,
where
is
the
obstruction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
just
follow
up
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
it's
not
the
safest
procedure
does
not
itself
constitute
an
undue
burden?
in
other
words,
under
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
said
that
the
state
can
prohibit
something
even
if
it
is
the
safest
procedure,
and
your
answer
was
so
long
as
it
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--pose
an
undue
burden.
and
i
was
just
following
up
to
say
that
so,
in
some
circumstances,
prohibiting
what
you
regard
is
the
safest
procedure
does
not
itself
constitute
an
undue
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
clement,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
05-380,
gonzales
versus
carhart
and
05-1382,
gonzales
versus
planned
parenthood
federation.
