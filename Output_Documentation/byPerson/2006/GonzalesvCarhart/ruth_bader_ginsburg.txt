justice

bader

general
clement--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
your
time
is
running
out
i
did
want
to
ask
you
about
a
feature
of
this
legislation
that
hasn't
come
up
so
far,
and
that
is
perhaps
stimulated
by
stenberg.
but
up
until
now,
all
regulation
on
access
to
abortion
has
been
state
regulation
and
this
measure
is
saying
to
the
states,
like
it
or
not,
the
federal
government
is
going
to
ban
a
particular
practice
and
we
are
going
to
take
away
the
choice
from
the
states,
in
an
area
where
up
until
now
it's,
it's
been
open
to
the
states
to
make
those
decisions.
how
should
that
weigh
in
this
case?
and
it
is
something
new.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
i
know,
when
it
is
a
question
of
funding--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
clement,
couldn't
a
similar
record
be
made
with
respect
to
what
is
the
more
common
procedure,
the
d&e,
that
involves
dismemberment
of
a
fetus
inside
the
womb.
so
assuming
you're
right
that
it
is
constitutional
for
congress
to
ban
the
d&x
proceeding,
wouldn't
the
same
reasoning
apply,
couldn't
congress
make
similar
findings
with
respect
to
what
is
the
most
common
method
for
second
trimester
abortions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
we
are
told
by
some
of
the
medical
briefs
that
the
procedure
is
basically
the
same,
they
start
out
in
the
same
way
and
that
the
difference...
the
differences
are
not
large
in
particular
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
clement,
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about,
because
i
think
you
have
recognized,
quite
appropriately,
that
we're
not
talking
about
whether
any
fetus
will
be
preserved
by
this
legislation.
the
only
question
that
you
are
raising
is
whether
congress
can
ban
a
certain
method
of
performing
an
abortion.
so
anything
about
infanticide,
babies,
all
that,
is
just
beside
the
point
because
what
this
bans
is
a
method
of
abortion.
it
doesn't
preserve
any
fetus
because
you
just
do
it
inside
the
womb
instead
of
outside.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
this
case
were
limited
to
post
viability
abortions
it
would
be
a
different
matter.
but
isn't
it
so
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
abortions
are
going
to
be
performed
previability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
general...
general
clement,
conditions
don't
show
up
in
the
abstract.
wouldn't
it
often
be
the
case
that
it
depends
on
the
vulnerability
of
the
particular
patient
and
you
couldn't
bring
a
preenforcement
challenge
as
to
that.
maybe
it's
a
question
of
hemorrhaging,
that...
it's
a
combination
of
what
the
condition
is
and
the
vulnerability
of
the
particular
patient
and
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
tested
in
advance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith,
was
the
statement
of
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and--
gynecologists
before
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
first
question
that
the
chief
asked
you,
you
said
yes,
it
will
prevent
abortions
because
of
this
uncertain
line
between
the
d&x
and
the
d&e.
is
there
a
way
that
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
that
would
have
insulated
the
physician
who's
performing
a
d&e?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
were
a
health
exception--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
health
of
the
woman,
would
that
obviate
the
vagueness
and
overbreadth
problems
that
you
bring
up?
because
then
after
we
say
to
the
doctor,
you
put
the
health
of
your
patients
first
and
if
you
think
that
it's
riskier
for
her
health
to
do
it
one
way
than
another
way,
then
you
pick
the
safer
way.
if
you
had
that,
then
wouldn't
the
concerns
about
overbreadth
fade?
