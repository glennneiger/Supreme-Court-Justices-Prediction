the
best
example
where
the
federal
government
has
gotten
involved
in
overriding
what
the
states
want
to
do
is
casey.
it
seems
rather
odd
for
this
court
to
be
concerned
about
stepping
on
the
toes
of
the
states.

but
we
don't
talk
about
a
leg
dying.
we
talk
about
the
fetus
dying,
i
think,
and
i
think
that's
not
the
leg.
justice

scalia
when
it's
halfway
out,
i
guess
you
can
call
it
either
a
child
or
a
fetus.
it's
sort
of
half
and
half,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it,
would
it
be
lawful
or
would
it
be
infanticide
to
deliver
the
fetus
entirely
and
just
let
it
expire
without
any
attempt
to
keep
it
alive?
