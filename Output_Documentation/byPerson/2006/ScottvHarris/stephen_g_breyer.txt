justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
why
you
concede
that.
i
mean,
i
looked
at
the
case
and
it
seemed
to
me
it's
a
case
involving
the
whole
ball
of
wax.
and
i
suspect
my
reaction
to
that
tape
was
in
part
affected
by
the
fact
that
he
went
through
the
shopping
center,
came
out
and
crashed
into
a
police
car,
which
is
what
scott
saw.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
do
i
know
whether,
which
of
these
things
is
directly
or
not
indirectly...
well,
you
go
ahead.
but
i
mean,
are
you...
am
i
not
supposed
to
look
at
the
part
which
involves
the
shopping
center?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
are
these
absolute?
i
mean
i
looked
at
garner
and
then
i
looked
at
graham
and
graham
which
came
later
said
that
all
claims
that
officers
have
used
excessive
force,
deadly
or
not,
should
be
analyzed
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
its
reasonableness
standard.
so
i
guess...
isn't
that
right,
isn't
that
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
if
that's
the
law,
then
whether...
of
course
an
automobile
could,
could
kill
people.
of
course
it
can.
so
can
a
lot
of
things.
but
an
automobile
isn't
a
gun,
and
a
chase
on
the
highway
is
not
a
chase
through
a
back
yard,
though
both
could
end
up
with
the
person
being
chased
dead.
so
aren't
we
supposed
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances,
including
the
circumstance
of
what...
one
that
interests
me,
one,
is
that
the
right
standard?
two,
did
scott
know
that
the
reason
he
was
chasing
this
person
was
because
he
had
violated
a
speed
limit,
or
was
he
ignorant
of
the
reason
why
the
individual
was
racing
away
at
90
miles
an
hour,
which
is
as
far
as
the
record
could
show?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
reasonable
juror
could
not
conclude
to
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
why
wouldn't
it
matter?
i
mean,
other
things
being
equal,
suppose
that
he
known
that
all
that
happens,
suppose
he
was
two
miles
beyond
the
speed
limit.
and
scott
knew
the
whole
thing
or
scott
was
the
one
who
did
it,
and
he
says
maybe
he
is
a
young
kid
who
is
frightened
and
he
has
his
license
number
and
he
could
get
him
later.
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
it
be
nutty
to...
to
try
to
bump
somebody
off
the
road,
when
all,
that's
all
that's
at
stake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
scott,
know
that?
did
scott...
do
you
have
evidence
to
show
that
scott
knew
that
the
underlying
offense
was
a
speeding
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
scott
has
testified
he
didn't
know
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
you
think
you
can
get
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
he
knew
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
a
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
sound
like
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
can
you--
get
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
scott
knew--
that
the
underlying
offense
was
for
speeding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
scott
didn't
know
it,
i
mean,
my
goodness,
then
i
don't
see
the
relevance
of
whether
it
was
speeding
or
not.
and
i
was
with
you
when
i
read
the...
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
and
i
read
the
other
brief.
i
was
on
the
other
side.
then
i've
been
shifting
back
and
forth.
then
i
look
at
that
tape,
and
i
have
to
say
that
when
i
looked
at
the
tape,
my
reaction
was
somewhat
similar
to
justice
alito's.
and
so
if
it's
doubtful
and
then
you
can't
even
show
that
the
person
who
did
it
knew
that
this
was
for
speeding
rather
than
for
murder,
how
can
you
get
to
the
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
where
i
started.
and
i
wondered...
that's
what
i'm
uncertain
about
the
standard
for
this.
because
as
you
and
the
others
have
been
arguing,
if
the
question
is
one
about
rules
surrounding
the
use
of
deadly
force.
but
then
when
i
read
what
i
read
out
to
you,
in
graham,
it
seemed
to
me
that
graham,
which
comes
after
garner,
says
that's
not
the
standard.
graham
is
a
standard
of
simple
reasonableness
and
garner
is
simply
an
illustration
of
that
as
applied
to
guns
and
a
backyard
chase,
not
as
applied
to
cars
which
threaten
other
people
much
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
standard?
am
i
supposed
to
apply...
am
i
not
supposed
to
apply
graham?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
i
cannot
do
the
following
under
the
law,
which
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
common
sense,
to
say
there
is
a
big
difference
between
a
policeman
shooting
a
person
who
is
running
away
and
threatens
no
harm
to
others,
and
a
policeman
using
a
gun...
using
a
car
on
a
highway
to
try
to
get
a
person
to
stop
who
is
threatening
others.
i
have
to
treat
those
exactly
as
if
they
were
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how...
i
mean,
you
know,
given
our
prior
discussion
here,
i
don't
see
how
that's
the
issue.
because
you
say
we
have
to
assume
that
the
defendant
here
didn't
know
that,
in
fact,
all
that
was
at
issue
was
a
violation
of
the
traffic
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
conduct...
it
could
be
conduct...
you
could
say
exactly
your
same
question,
just
as
the
chief
just
said.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
to
get
around
this.
you
could
say
the
question
was,
does
a
person
who
reasonably
thinks
he
might
be
being
pursued
for
a
murder--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
am
i...
you
said
factually.
what
am
i
supposed
to
assume?
you
said
in
light
of...
i
mean,
i
looked
at
the
tape
and
that
tape
shows
he
is
weaving
on
both
sides
of
the
lane,
swerving
around
automobiles
that
are
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
with
their
lights
on,
goes
through
a
red
light
where
there
are
several
cars
that
are
right
there,
weaves
around
them,
and
there
are
cars
coming
the
other
way,
weaves
back,
goes
down
the
road.
now,
what
in
fact...
am
i
supposed
to
pretend
i
haven't
seen
that?
what
am
i
supposed
to
pretend
to
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
see
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't...
i
thought
that...
you
didn't
see
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i...
what
i
saw
is
he
is
driving
down
one
lane,
what
i
mean
by
weaving,
and
this
lane
goes
with
me
in
traffic.
and
there
is
some
cars
in
front
of
him,
so
he
goes
in
the
other
lane
where
the
cars
are
now
coming
right
directly
at
him.
and
then
before
they
hit
him,
he
goes
back
to
the
first
lane
and
he
does
this
while
going
through
a
red
light,
it
seemed
to
me.
am
i...
did
i
mis-see
that?
i'll
go
look
at
it
again
if
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
that's,
that's
what
i
wonder.
if
the
court
says
that
isn't
what
happened,
and
i
see
with
my
eyes
that
is
what
happened,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
i'll
look
again
at
the
tape.
i
certainly
will
do
that.
but
suppose
i
look
at
the
tape
and
i
end
up
with
chico
marx's
old
question
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals:
who
do
you
believe,
me
or
your
own
eyes?
