mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
suspect
disobeys
a
lawful
command
to
stop,
races
off
in
a
reckless
attempt
to
elude
the
police,
and
demonstrates
a
disregard
for
his
own
life
and
the
lives
of
others
in
his
path,
the
police
may
use
force,
including
deadly
force,
to
bring
the
suspect's
vehicle
flight
to
a
halt
and
protect
the
public
safety.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
does,
your
honor.
the
key
determination
is
whether
the
officer
on
the
scene
reasonably
determines
that
the
vehicle
poses
a
substantial
risk
to
other
motorists
or
the
police
in
his
way.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
agree
that
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
here
what
you
have
is
an
individual
who's
going
extraordinarily
high
speeds,
80
to
100
miles
an
hour.
an
individual
who
has
passed
cars,
crossed
the
double,
double
line;
there
were
numerous
motors,
motor
vehicles
on
the
night.
and
an
individual
who
has
ran
red
lights,
an
individual
who
when
three
police
cars--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
as
the
court
said
in
the
sacramento
versus
lewis
case,
we
don't
blame
police
for
the
individual's
reckless
flight
in
that
context.
we
don't
blame
police
that
respondent
made
a
decision
to
just--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
on
this
record,
justice
stevens.
in
this
particular--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
sc
alia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
agree,
justice
scalia.
as
justice
kennedy
put
it
sacramento
versus
lewis,
if
there's
a
real
danger--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
question
in
our
mind,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
deputy
scott
reasonably
believed
that
respondent
posed
a
serious
risk
of
injury
or
death
to
other
motor
vehicles,
bystanders
or
police
on
the
roadway
that
night.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
breyer,
to
answer
the
second
question
first,
scott
did
not
know
that
he
was
initially
in
a
chase.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
scott,
i
believe,
scott's
testimony
was
that
he
did
not
know.
what
scott
knew,
and
he
was
engaged
in
the
chase,
was
this
is
an
individual
who
had
crossed
cars,
crossed
the
double
yellow
line.
this
was
an
individual
who
had
ran
red
lights.
this
was
an
individual,
when
three
police
squad
cars
converged
on
him
in
the
shopping
center
parking
lot,
collided
with
them
and
ran
off
into
the
highway,
reaching
again
speeds
up
to
90
miles
an
hour.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is,
certainly,
at
a
commonsense
level.
statistic
show
that
most
vehicles
who
flee
in
this
fashion,
oftentimes
there
is
alcohol
or
drug
abuse
involved,
oftentimes
they
are
stolen
vehicles.
we
don't
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
justice
scalia...
uh,
justice
stevens.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
that's
true.
the
key,
the
key
point
about
this
case
is
the
threat
that
respondent
posed
in
the...
suspects
who
engage
in
high
speed
vehicle
chases
pose
to
the
public,
and
that
is,
that
is
fundamentally
different
from
garner
for
the
reason
that
you
mentioned.
garner
involved--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
it
doesn't
matter
why
the
chase
began.
the
point
is
that
when
scott
made
the
decision
to
use
force
against
respondent,
he
reasonably
determined
that
respondent
posed
a
grave
threat
to
other
motorists,
the
police
and
any
bystanders
who
might
come
in
his
way.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
because,
your
honor,
regardless
of
the
reason
the
chase
began,
at
the
moment
that
deputy
scott
used
the
force,
this
car
posed
a
serious
risk
to
everyone
else
on
the
road
that
night.
someone
traveling
90
miles
an
hour,
up
to
90
miles
an
hour,
on
a
two-lane
windy
road
with
numerous
cars
passing
during
this
course
of
the
chase,
it
was
that
threat
that
deputy
scott
acted
against
when
he
used
that
force,
and
that
was
a
reasonable
use
of
force.
it's
reasonable
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
court
determines--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
ginsburg,
the
holding
in
that
case
was
that
a
roadblock
amounted
to
a
seizure.
and
we
don't,
no
one
disputes
there
was
a
seizure
in
this
case
when
deputy
scott
intentionally
used
force
to
put
respondents
off
the
road.
so
it
respect,
brower
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
or
not
that
use
of
force
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
justice
kennedy
in
the
sacramento
versus
lewis
case,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
say
that
there
was
a
real
danger
of
adopting
a
constitutional
rule
that
suspects
are
free
to
disobey
lawful
commands.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the...
ultimately
to
determine
whether
this
decision
could
be
made
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
you
would
have
to
consider
whether
a
jury
could
find
it
unreasonable.
here,
on
the
relevant
undisputed
facts,
we
submit
as
a
matter
of
law,
deputy
scott
reasonably
believed
that
this
force
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
and
the
final
point
that
i
wanted
to
make,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
concurrence,
is
that
there
is
a
real
danger
in
adopting
that
kind
of
constitutional
rule,
that
it
will
encourage
more
suspects
to
flee,
and
will
only
increase
the
danger
to
the
public
and
to
police
and
to
motorists
in
these
high
speed
chases.
i
would
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
