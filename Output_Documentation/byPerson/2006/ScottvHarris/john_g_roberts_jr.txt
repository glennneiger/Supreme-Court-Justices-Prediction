chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
05-1631,
scott
versus
harris.
mr.
savrin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
was
speeding
before
the
police
knew
about
him,
right?
that's
the
whole,
where
this
all
started.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
savrin.
mr.
garre?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
matter
exactly
what
the
nature
of
the
escape
was?
are
we
supposed
to
evaluate
whether
this
was
reckless
enough?
well,
let's
say
the
driver
did
not
go
off
90
miles
an
hour.
let's
say
he
obeyed
the
speed
limit.
he
just
wasn't
going
to
stop.
does
that
make
it
a
different
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
reasonable
for
him
to
suppose
that
there
might
be
something
more
going
on
if
the
guy
is
trying
this
hard
to
get
away
from
a
speeding
ticket?
that
presents
he
presents
a
danger
to
the
community
quite
apart
from
the
driving?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
factor
that
goes
into
the
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
doubt
that
mr.
harris
was
likely
to
cause
death
or
serious
injury
to
the
other
cars
on
the
highway
that
he
was
passing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
about
driving
in
violation
of
traffic
laws.
we
talking
about
90
miles
an
hour
on
a
two-lane
highway,
swerving
past
cars
in
the
incoming
traffic--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--hitting...
after
hitting
officer
scott's
car
and
continuing
on.
that's
a
little
more
than
just
unsafe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
eleventh
circuit
gave
the
exact
opposite
answer
in
the
adams
case,
which
if
you're
looking
at
what
the...
was
clearly
established
law
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
officer
that
provides
him
guidance
that
the
garner
case
does
not
dictate
a
result
in
the
use
of
deadly
force
in
the
police
chase
case
involving
an
automobile.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
officer
scott
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
law
was,
he
should
have
relied
on
the
dissent
in
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
finish
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
i
could
just
get
back
to
an
earlier
point.
you
think
what
the
officer
should
have
done
in
this
case
was
to
let
mr.
harris
go.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
he
doesn't
know
at
that
point
that
he
will
ever
be
able
to
arrest
him
later.
he
doesn't
know
if
it's
a
stolen
car
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he
doesn't
know
why
he
is
being
pursued,
whether
it's
for
mass
murder
or
terrorism
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
once
they
have
gotten
away,
i
assume.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
aren't
you
concerned
that
that
creates
an
incentive
in
every
case
for
anyone
who,
that
sees
the
blue
lights
behind
them
to
know
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
keep
fleeing
and
the
police
are
going
to
have
to
give
up
eventually?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
garner...
garner
was
the
case
involving
shooting
the
guy
in
the
back,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
savrin,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
jones'
statement
that
none
of
mr.
harris'
conduct
rose
to
the
level
of
a
felony?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
savrin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
05-1631,
scott
versus
harris.
