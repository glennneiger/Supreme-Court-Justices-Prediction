before
do
you
that,
will
you
go
back
to
the
philadelphia
case.
do
you
contend
that
a
jury
could
find
that
he
reasonably
believed
that
he
would
not
cause,
that
he
would
not
raise
a
serious
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
by
bumping
the
car
at
90
miles
an
hour?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
that.
how
could
such
a
belief
be
reasonable?
what
am
i
missing
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
why,
why
would
it
be
reasonable
to
believe
that
a
car
could
be
bumped
at
90
miles
an
hour
plus
without
raising
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm?
how
could
such
a
belief
be
reasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
people
are
lucky.
we're
talking
about
creating
a
substantial
risk.
how
would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
one
would
not
create
a
substantial
risk?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
phrase
used
was
"take
him
out",
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
was
whether
he
was
creating
a
substantial
risk
doing
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
my,
my
question
is
how
could
a
jury
find
otherwise?
your
answer
up
to
this
point
is
that
well,
he
used
signal
lights
and
his
reflexes
were
good,
and
they
sure
were.
but
the
question
is
whether
he
was
creating
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
to
others.
and
my
question
is
leaving...
assuming
that
his
reflexes
were
good
and
he
knew
how
to
use
the
signal
lights,
how
could
the
jury
fail
to
find
that
he
was
creating
such
a
risk?
justice
david
h.
souter
garner
was
not
talking
about
someone
who
at
the
time
the
deadly
force
was
used
was
himself
creating
a
substantial
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
to
others.
that's
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
officer's
action
depends
on
whether,
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
a
jury
can
reasonably
find
that,
in
fact,
he
was
not
creating
at
that
moment,
a
substantial
risk
of
serious
bodily
harm
or
death
to
others.
and
my
question
is,
how
could
a
jury
find
anything
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
moment
scott
came
into
this
case,
what
difference
does
that
make?
why
is
that
even
relevant?
let's
assume
scott
knew
that
this
entire
situation
had
eventuated
out
of
an
18
mile
in
excess
of
speed
act
by
the
individual.
assume
that.
what
scott
also
knew
at
the
point
at
which
he
joined
the
chase
was
that
this
individual
was
driving
a
car
at
90
miles
an
hour.
he
was
crossing
yellow
lines,
going
through
red
lights,
et
cetera.
at
that
point,
wasn't
the
only
legally
relevant
data
whether
or
not
harris
was
creating
the
risk
of
death
or
bodily
harm
to
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
agree
that
whether
scott
knew
or
didn't
know,
that
this
whole
scenario
had
eventuated
out
of
a
speeding
situation
was
irrelevant?
