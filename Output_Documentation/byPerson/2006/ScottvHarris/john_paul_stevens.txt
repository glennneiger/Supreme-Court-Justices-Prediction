justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
this
question
about
the
shopping
center.
wouldn't
your
case
be
exactly
the
same
if
the
shopping
center
incident
had
not
occurred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
we
really
don't
have
to
get
distracted
by
the
shopping
center?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
the
speed
also
relevant
to
the
likelihood
that...
that
running
into
a
car
at
that
speed
would
cause
the
death
of
a
driver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
a
fair
high
probability
that
if
you
hit
someone
at
that
speed
that
there
will
be
something,
either
death
or
serious
injury
as
a
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
contend
that
an
officer
can
always
use
deadly
force
to
stop
a
high-speed
driver
who's
creating
this
kind
of
a
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
running
into
him
with
a
high
probability
that
he'll
get
killed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
that
acknowledged
in
the
district
court,
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
jury
might
find
that
it
was
deadly
force.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
conclude
that
the
jury
could
not
find
that
it
was
deadly
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
is
your...
is
it
your
view
that
a
jury
could
not
find
on
these
facts
that
there
was
deadly
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
a
police
officer
have
any
obligation
in
a
situation
like
this
to
consider
other
alternatives,
and
if
so
what
other
alternatives
might
have
been
available
to
this
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
with
letting
him
go,
isn't
it
possible
they
could
get
other
roadblocks
up
ahead
or
get
other
people
involved
in
the
attempt
to
catch
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
there's
no
traffic
on
the
road
at
that
particular
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
that
circumstance
why
wouldn't
he
just
consider
discontinuing
the
chase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
have
been
likely
if
the
officer
had
discontinued
the
chase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
that
was
while
he
was
being
chased,
right?
before
being
chased
he
hadn't
done
any
of
this.
he
was
going
72
miles
an
hour
in
a
55-mile
zone,
isn't
that
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
but
if
you're
thinking
of
the
likelihood
of
harm
if
they
discontinued
the
chase,
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
he
might
go
back
to
going
72
miles
an
hour
in
a
55-mile
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
isn't
a
question.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
it
justifies
the
use
of
deadly
force,
to
prevent
this...
this
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
knew
there
were
drugs
in
the
car
that
he
would
dispose
of
if
he
had
got
caught.
would
that
justify
this
using
deadly
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
rather
clear
it
would
not,
isn't
it?
because
that
would
be
no
more
serious
than
the
crime
in
garner,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
this
one
point?
is
it
correct
that
the
issue
is
whether
it's
reasonable
or
is
the
issue
whether
a
jury
could
find
it
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
question.
in
trying
to
assess
the
likelihood
of
harm
to
innocent
people
who
would
be
hurt
by
this
by
this
guy
driving
so
fast,
is
that,
do
we
measure
it
by
assuming
that
the
chase
will
continue?
or
do
we
measure
it
by
assuming
that
the
chase
would
be
discontinued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
as
we
did
in
garner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
were...
clear
that
a
jury
could
find
that
there
would
be
no
unreasonable
risk
to
innocent
motorists
if
they
discontinued
the
chase...
assume
that's
a
possible
finding.
if
that
were
true,
would
there
be
a
duty
to
discontinue
the
chase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
there
is
a
duty
not
to
use
deadly
force.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a,
a
risk
of
deadly
harm
to
innocent
third
parties,
there
would
be
a
duty
to
discontinue
the
chase
rather
kill
him.
but
you
don't
seem
to
buy
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
should
have
briefly
mentioned
the
four
points
that
i
made
in
my
dissent.
the
first,
while
the
video
tape
described
by
justice
scalia
has
convinced
all
eight
of
my
colleagues
that
the
police
acted
reasonably
when
they
use
deadly
force
to
terminate
the
high
speed
chase.
it
is
significant
that
after
viewing
the
same
video,
the
district
judge
and
all
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
all
of
whom
are
more
familiar
with
driving
conditions
in
georgia
than
any
of
us,
all
concluded
that
the
case
raised
a
question
that
should
be
submitted
to
a
jury
and
rather
than
to
be
decided
by
a
group
of
elderly
appellate
judges.
second,
two
significant
facts
that
maybe
overlooked
by
observers
of
the
video
explain
why
there
were
no
accidents
or
even
narrow
misses
during
the
chase.
it
occurred
in
the
late
evening
when
traffic
was
light
and
no
pedestrians
were
present,
not
a
single
one
even
in
the
shopping
center
that’s
mentioned
in
the
opinion.
moreover,
the
risk
of
an
accidental
collision
was
significantly
reduced
by
the
fact
that
the
police
sirens
gave
other
drivers
the
same
warning
that
a
siring
on
an
ambulance
or
a
fire
engine
does.
if
you
look
at
the
video
of
the
chase
on
the
internet,
you
will
note
that
several
vehicles
pulled
off
the
road
and
at
the
shoulder
before
respondent
and
the
officer
sped
by.
the
siren
is
somewhat
muted
because
the
video
camera
presumably
was
inside
the
police
vehicle
but
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
significantly
minimized
the
risk
of
an
accident
and
it
is
true,
that
multiple
that
is
two
polices’
stop
lights
would
run
during
the
chase
but
because
the
drivers
had
been
warned
of
the
on-coming
vehicles,
they
were
all
stationary
when
the
police
cars
drove
by.
so,
the
risk
was
not
as
dramatic
as
the
majority
suggests.
third,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
police
did
use
deadly
force.
their
decision
to
ram
respondent’s
car
from
behind
at
a
very
high
speed
in
order
to
terminate
the
chase
did
not
actually
result
in
the
driver’s
death.
it
did
however
render
him
in
quadriplegic
at
the
age
of
19
and
it
was
unquestionably
and
application
of
the
force
as
deadly
as
the
use
of
a
firearm
for
example.
the
fourth,
the
question
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
use
deadly
force
to
terminate
a
high
speed
chase
against
someone
who
has
committed
a
speeding
violation
and
who
has
also
ignored
a
police
command
to
stop,
is
a
matter
of
debate
among
law
enforcement
professionals.
we
now
know
that
the
police
had
respondent’s
license
number
and
could
have
arrested
him
after
he
got
home,
that
at
the
time
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
would
escape
punishment
entirely
if
they
abandoned
the
chase.
the
choice
was
between
letting
him
escape
or
using
deadly
force
to
get
him
off
the
road.
under
our
cases,
the
choice
they’ve
made
was
reasonable
yet
it
was
necessary
to
protect
third
party
from
serious
harm.
there
is
a
brief
file
on
behalf
of
the
georgia
association
which
police
points
out
when
the
danger
to
the
public
created
by
the
pursuit
is
greater
than
the
danger
in
allowing
the
suspect
to
remain
at
large
then
the
pursuit
should
be
discontinued.
just
as
reasonable
police
officers
might
well
disagree
with
the
decision
that
was
made
in
this
case,
it
is
equally
clear
to
me
that
reasonable
jurors
could
come
to
different
conclusions
about
the
reasonableness
of
what
we
now
know
was
a
tragic
mistake.
