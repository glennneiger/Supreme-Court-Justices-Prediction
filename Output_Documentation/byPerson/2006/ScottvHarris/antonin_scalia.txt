justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
if
this
fellow
driving
90
miles
an
hour
is
responsible
for
endangering
people,
you're
proposing
a
rule
that
says
if
there's
a
50
percent
chance
that
he'll
hurt
some
innocent
person
and
a
50
percent
chance
that
he'll
get
hurt
if
you
try
to
stop
him,
you
shouldn't
do
anything.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
stop
him.
i
mean,
he's
the
fellow
that's
causing
the
danger,
endangerment,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
giving
away
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
there
is
also
a
high
probability
where
you're
going
90
miles
an
hour
on
a
one-way
road,
crossing
over
the
double
yellow
line,
with
oncoming
traffic,
that
you're
going
to
hurt
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
more
you
increase
the
speed
the
more
likely
he's
going
to
be
hurt.
but
also
the
more
likely
if
you
let
him
go
somebody
else
is
going
to
be
hurt.
justice
antonin
scalia
finish
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
he
reasonably...
because
scott
reasonably
believed
that
he
could
bump
the
car
off
the
road
at
90
miles
an
hour
without
risking
the
driver's
life?
is
that
why
it's
like
the
third
circuit
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
third
circuit
case
you
just
described
didn't
talk
about
intent.
it
talked
about
reasonable
belief.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
might
also
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
anyone
who
was
chased
by
the
police
will
immediately
speed
up
to
90
miles
an
hour.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
very
good
rule
to
give
to
police
forces:
anybody
who's
going
72
miles
an
hour,
let
him
go.
or
at
least
if
he
hits
90,
let
him
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
created
the
scariest
chase
i
ever
saw
since
"the
french
connection".
[laughter]
it
is
frightening.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
frightening
amount
of
speed,
and
cars
coming
in
the
opposite
direction,
at
night,
on
a
two-lane
windy
road--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
issue
in
the
case
was
quite
simply
whether
there
had
been
a
seizure.
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
he
is
shooting
his
way
out
of
the
house
and
endangering
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
a
factor
here,
of
course.
if
he
has
taken
the
jewelry
and
he's
gone
off
into
the
night,
if
shooting
at
him
might
endanger
somebody
else,
or
even
kill
him,
you
have
to
let
him
go.
i'm
talking
about
a
burglar
who
is,
you
know,
who
is
shooting
as
he
leaves.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
can
shoot
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
factual
finding
of
the,
of
the
trial
court
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
bound
by
that
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
having
watched
the
tape,
there
is
no
way
that,
that
factual
finding
can
be
accurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
could
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
i
ask
whether
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
you
say
establishes
that
he
was
not
endangering
anybody
is
this
portion?
the
court
is
mindful
that
traffic
laws
are
designed
to...
safely...
and
harris
acted
in
an
unsafe
manner.
however,
the
record
reflects
"#
is
this
the
portion"?
justice
antonin
scalia
"#
that
he
maintained
control
over
his
vehicle.
"
well,
that
doesn't
prove
he's
not
endangering
anybody.
"used
his
turn
signals"...
wonderful.
[laughter]
"and
did
not
endanger
any
particular
motorist
on
the
road.
"
i
think
that's
true.
in
that
scary
chase
he,
he
didn't
come
close
to
hitting
any
particular
car,
but
i
don't
think
that's,
that's
a
finding
that
he
was
not
endangering
anybody.
"any
particular
motorist",
but
he
was
endangering
the
public
at
large.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
fast...
if
depends
on
how
fast
the
car
is
going,
whether
it's
a
two-lane
road
or
four-lane
divided
highway.
all
those
factors
come
into,
into
account.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we
have
to
adopt
a
rule
that
will,
that
will
discourage
police
officers.
there's,
there's
enough
disincentive
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity
in
the
fact
that
the
police
officer
may
hurt
himself.
it's
pretty
risky
to
conduct
this
kind
of
a
maneuver,
don't--
you
think?
i
wouldn't
have
done
it
if
i
was
scott.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
let
the
guy
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
driving
90
miles
an
hour
and
comes
up,
approaches
that
car,
that
car
swerved.
scott
could
have
been
killed,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
think
we
need
a
whole
lot
of
disincentive
to
stop
police
officers
in
engaging
in
frolicsome
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
this
study
show
what
future
fleeing
speeders
would
do?
i
mean,
i
will
accept
that
for,
for
the
sake
of
argument
that...
in
fact,
it's
probably
true.
i
would
have
guessed
that,
if
the
police
stopped
chasing,
you
don't
go
90
miles
an
hour
anymore.
but
did
this
study
show
what
the
effect
of
a
rule
that
says
stop
chasing
when
he
hits
85,
what
the
effect
of
that
rule
would
be
on,
on
fleeing
speeders
or
fleeing
felons,
or
fleeing
anybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
he
is
endangering
anybody
is
a
historical
fact,
no?
so
what
do
you
do
about
that
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
hope
he
would
wait
until
there
were
no
pedestrians
or
vehicles
coming
before
he,
before
he
did
the
ramming.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
he
waited
precisely
for
that
kind
of
a
gap
in
the
traffic?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
convulsively
it
is
not
another
peppy
case.
in
march
2001,
georgia
county
deputy
clocked
respondent’s
vehicle
traveling
at
73
miles
an
hour
on
a
road
with
a
55-mile
an
hour
speed
limit.
the
deputy
activated
his
blue
flashing
lights
indicating
that
respondent
should
pull
over.
instead
respondent
sped
away
initiating
a
chase
at
speeds
exceeding
85
miles
an
hour.
petitioner
deputy,
timothy
scott
joined
the
pursuit
along
with
other
officers.
six
minutes
and
nearly
10
miles
after
the
chase
had
begun,
scott
decided
to
attempt
to
terminate
the
episode
by
applying
his
push
bumper
to
the
rear
of
respondent’s
vehicle.
he
did
so
and
as
a
result
respondent
lost
control
of
the
vehicle
which
left
the
road
way,
ran
down
on
bank
and
overturn
and
crashed.
respondent
was
badly
injured
and
was
rendered
a
quadriplegic.
he
filed
suit
against
deputy
scott
alleging
a
violation
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights
mainly
the
use
of
excessive
force
resulting
in
an
unreasonable
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
response,
scott
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
an
assertion
of
qualified
immunity.
the
eleventh
circuit
denied
that
motion
holding
that
the
case
should
proceed
to
trial.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
hold
that
deputy
scott
is
entitled
to
summary
judgment
because
his
actions
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
the
first
step
in
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
scott’s
actions
is
to
determine
the
relevant
facts.
when
as
here,
the
case
is
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
this
usually
means
adopting
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
the
plaintiff’s
version
of
the
facts.
there
is
however
an
added
wrinkle
in
this
case.
the
existence
in
the
record
of
a
video
tape
from
cameras
mounted
in
the
front
of
the
pursued
vehicles,
capturing
the
events
in
question.
the
video
quite
clearly
contradicts
the
version
of
the
story,
told
by
respondent
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
video,
we
see
respondent’s
vehicle
racing
down
narrow
two-lane
roads
in
the
dead
of
night
at
speeds
that
are
shockingly
fast.
we
see
it
swerve
around
more
than
a
dozen
other
cars,
crossed
the
double
yellow
line
and
force
cars
traveling
in
both
directions
to
their
respective
shoulders
in
order
to
avoid
being
hit.
we
see
it
run
multiple
red
lights
and
traveled
for
considerable
periods
of
time
in
the
occasional
center
and
left
turn
only
lane.
far
from
being
the
cautious
and
controlled
driver
that
the
lower
court
depicts,
what
we
see
on
the
video
more
closely
resembles
a
hollywood
style
car
chase
of
the
most
frightening
sort,
placing
police
officers
and
innocent
by-standers
alike
at
great
risk
of
serious
injury.
since,
the
dissent
contradicts
this
account,
we
have
made
the
video
available
on
the
supreme
court
website
at
the
web
address
sighted
in
footnote
five
of
our
opinion.
when
opposing
parties
tell
two
different
stories,
one
of
which
is
blatantly
contradicted
by
the
record
so
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
believe
it,
a
court
should
not
adopt
that
version
of
the
facts
for
purposes
of
ruling
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
respondent’s
version
of
events
is
so
utterly
discredited
by
the
record
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
believed
him.
the
court
of
appeal
should
not
have
relied
on
such
visible
fiction,
it
should
have
view
the
facts
in
the
light
depicted
by
the
video
tape
which
shows
that
respondent
was
placing
the
innocent
public
at
severe
risk.
judging
the
matter
on
that
basis,
we
think
it
quite
clear
that
deputy
scott
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
respondent
after
all
who
intentionally
engaged
in
the
lengthy,
reckless,
high
speed
flight
that
posed
an
actual
and
imminent
threat
to
numerous
innocent
lives.
scott’s
attempt
to
eliminate
that
threat
by
bumping
respondent
off
the
road
was
reasonable.
we
reject
respondent’s
contention
that
the
police
should
have
broken
off
the
chase,
both
because
of
that
would
not
have
provided
assurance
that
respondent
would
slow
down
to
a
safe
speed,
and
because
of
constitutional
rule
requiring
the
breaking
off
of
chase
would
produce
perverse
incentives
rewarding
life
threatening
recklessness
with
impunity.
the
constitution
assuredly
does
not
require
such
rule.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent.
