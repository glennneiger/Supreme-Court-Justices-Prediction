mr.
craig
t.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
petitioner.
first
of
all,
officer
scott
himself
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
he
knew
at
the
time
that
he
was
using
deadly
force,
and
he
realized
at
the
time
that
he
was
likely
to
cause
injury
or...
death
or
serious
injury
to
mr.
harris.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
mr.
harris
was
simply
a...
an
unsafe
driver.
there
is
always
a
risk
at
driving
in
excess
of
speed
limit,
driving
in
violation
of
traffic
laws.
but
that
risk
in
and
of
itself
is
not--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
we're
talking--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
those
are
not
the
facts
before
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
are
that
he
was
driving
fast
but
he
was
under
control.
he
only
crossed
the
center
line
to
pass
and
when
he
passed,
he
used
his
turn
signal
when
he
passed.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
when
he
turned
into
the...
when
he
turned
into
the
shopping
center
he
wasn't
weaving
through
a
parking
lot.
he
was
going
through
a
private
access
road
in
a
shopping
mall
which
was
closed
at
11
o'clock
at
night.
and
the
collision,
the
impact
occurred
when
officer
scott,
who
was
going
too
fast
to
make
the
turn
into
the
shopping
center,
went
up
to
the
next
intersection,
came
around
the
other
way
to
head
my
client
off
at
the
pass.
and
then
what
happened
was
that
mr.
harris
took
evasive
action
to
a
avoid
collision
when
mr.
harris...
excuse
me
when
officer
scott...
put
himself
right
in
mr.
harris'
way.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
as
a--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
as
the
court
below
found,
and
as
the
tape
indicates,
mr.
harris
didn't
run
anybody
off
the
road.
he
didn't
ram
anybody.
he
didn't
try
to
ram
anybody.
he
was
just
driving
away.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
he
was
creating--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
the
jury
could
certainly
find
he's
creating
a
risk.
but
with
regard
to
the
other
garner
factors
that
must
be
shown
before
deadly
force
can
be
used,
he
had
not
committed
a
violent
felony,
a
crime
involving
the
infliction
or
threat
of
infliction--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
a
jury
could
find
that
the
pursuit
by
the
officer
escalated
the
risk
rather
than
diminishing
the
risk
to
others.
and
that
given
a
choice
between
using
deadly
force
to
terminate
a
pursuit
where
the
officer
himself
had
escalated
the
risk
versus
backing
off,
letting
the
offender
escape
and
then
perhaps
arresting
him
an
hour
later
at
the
house.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
we
have
evidence
that
it
was
called
out
on
the
radio.
"i'm
pursuing
somebody".
whether
scott
knew
we
don't
know.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
scott
has
testified
he--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--scott--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--the
testimony--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--i'm
not
certain
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
scott
did
not
know
that
was
it.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
there
is
certainly
a
credibility
issue
as
to
whether
scott
says
he
knew
or
didn't
know.
i
mean,
certainly
the
call
on
the
radio
he
could
have
acquired.
the
thing
is
that--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--that
assumption
would
not
be
based
upon
probability
or
based
upon
police
training.
officers
in
pursuit
situations
are
trying
to
believe--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--the
vast
majority
have
committed
minor
crimes.
and
it's
not
a
rational--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--that's
the
issue.
was
there
an
immediate
risk
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--it's
not
relevant.
it's
relevant
to
that
termination.
yeah,
the
issue
is,
is
there
an
immediate
risk.
but
one
of
the
factors
that
is
significant
is
what
is
the
severity
of
the
underlying
crime.
and
if
it
is
a
crime
of
violence,
then
certainly
the
officer
is
entitled
to
presume--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
that's
a
good
question.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
whether
you
apply
garner
or
graham,
the
result
is
the
same
in
this
case.
and
let
me
explain
why.
what
graham
did
is
it
expanded
the
garner
rule,
which
you
can't
use
deadly
force
to
stop
a
fleeing
suspect
who
is
merely
fleeing,
expanded
that
to
include
the
entire
range
of
use
of
force,
deadly
or
nondeadly.
and
with
regard
to
the
factors
that
are
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
use
of
force
is
reasonable
under
graham,
the
balance
with
respect
to
a
fleeing
suspect
who
is
subjected
to
deadly
force
was
already
drawn
by
garner.
garner
created
a
bright
light
rule.
graham
extended
that
to
an
ad
hoc
balancing
test
with
all
use
of
force
applications.
but
with
respect
to
deadly
force
and
a
fleeing
suspect,
garner
still
provides
a
bright
line
rule.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes.
and
garner,
this
court's
decision
in
garner
and
this
court's
decision
in
brower,
which
was
written
by
justice
scalia,
basically
to
quote
brower
in
both
cases.
in
the
brower
versus
county
of
inyo--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
the
holding
of
the
adams
versus
st.
lucie
county
case
was
that
in
1985,
an
incident
which
occurred
six
weeks
after
the
garner
decision
and
four
years
before
the
brower
decision,
there
is
no
way
the
officers
could
have
known
at
that
time
that
their
act
of
ramming
a
police
car
to
prevent
an
escape
of
another
fleeing
vehicle
would
have
been
considered
deadly
force
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
the,
in
the
adams
case,
though,
certainly
as
of
the
court's
decision
in
1993,
this
was
now
clearly
established.
you
had
brower
saying
that
it's
a
seizure,
and
then
you
had
this
court
saying
that
now
the
law
was
clearly
established
where
it
wasn't
before--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
another
case
came
about
later
which
held
that
as
early
as
1998
in
another
case
involving
the
same
department,
that
there
was
clearly
established
law.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
brower
versus
county
of
inyo
says--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--it
was
a
roadblock
which--
produced
a
collision,
a
physical
impact
between
vehicles.
and
that
was
the...
that
was
the
distinction
which
justice
scalia
latched
onto
in
that
case,
and
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
person
was
fleeing
by
car
in
brower
was
no
different
than
the
burglar
fleeing
by
foot
in
garner.
either
one
of
them--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--that
was
the
first
holding.
the
second
holding
was
that
the
plaintiff
had
sufficiently
claimed
a
cause
of
action
on
the
seizure.
and
then
it
went
back
to
the
lower
court
to
be
considered
under
the
garner
analysis.
and
what
i
liked
about
your
decision...
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
what
i
liked
about
your
decision
in
that
case,
justice
scalia,
was
that
you
said
that
the
officer's
culpability
for
using
excessive
force
is
not
diminished
by
the
fact
that
perpetrator
chose
to
continue
running,
whether
it
was
the
fleeing
burglar
in
garner
or
the
fleeing
driver
in
brower.
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that
was
one
option.
he
could
have
continued
the
pursuit
and
simply
decided
not
to
mow
him
off
the
road
at
90
miles
an
hour,
or
he
could
have
stopped
a
pursuit
and
let
him
go
which
often
happens
in
many
pursuits.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
that's
correct.
but
in
the
majority
of
cases...
and
this
is
the
only
testimony
in
this
record,
your
honors.
our
experts
testified
on
a
study...
based
on
a
study
which
was
commissioned
for
him
by
the
department
of
justice,
a
study
which
has
been
cited
by
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
on
both
sides
in
this
case,
dr.
albert
testified
that
70
percent
of
the
time,
when
police
back
off
pursuit,
the
perpetrator
stops
running
and
they
resume
safe
driving.
and
when
the
car
is
stolen,
most
of
the
time--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
sometimes
you
have
to
let
them
get
away.
in
garner,
it
says,
even
if
the
guy
has
just
broken
into
somebody's
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
committed
a
felony,
if
the
choice
is
letting
them
go
or
using
deadly
force
when
the
factors
authorizing
deadly
force
are
not
present,
you
have
to
let
him
go.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
you
can
shoot
him.
i'd
be
there
shooting
him,
too.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
let
me
take
that
distinction
and
apply
it
to
the
vehicle,
justice
scalia.
what
we
have
to
have
to
authorize
deadly
force
in
this
context
is
something
more
than
just
unsafe
flight.
you've
got
to
have
someone
who
is
behaving
violently,
who
is
menacing
people,
trying
to
ram
people.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
no.
all
he
had
done
was
taken
evasive
action
to
avoid
an
officer
who--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--are
you
talking
about
the
traffic
pursuit?
mr.
craig
t.
jones
no,
none
of
those
are
felonies
under
georgia
law.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
even
a
felony
in
georgia.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
if
he
had
intended
to
hit
the
police
officer,
if
that
was
shown
by
the
evidence,
so
they
could
have
charged
with
aggravated
assault.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
left
traffic
citations
in
his
hospital
room.
they
never
arrested
him.
they
never
prosecuted
him.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
hope
i
don't
have
you
on
my
jury
if
that's...
but
what
the
trial
court
found
was
that
construing
the
facts
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
as
a
nonmoving
party,
that
reasonable
jurors
can
find
that
this
was
simply
a
person
who
was
driving
fast.
this
was
not
a
person
who
was
driving
assaultively.
he
wasn't
driving
violently.
he
wasn't
a
threat
to
anyone
that
would
authorize
the
use
of
deadly
force
against
him.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
that
is
a
factual
finding.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
we
are
bound
by
that.
this
is
an
interlocutory
appeal,
this
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
mitchell
v.
forsythe,
and
the
court
is
bound
by
its
own
ruling
to
accept
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
below,
and
decide
the
narrow
issue
of
law
here
which
is,
one,
is
there
a
constitutional
violation
on
these
facts.
and
two,
was
the
law
clearly
established.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
if
you
want
to
repeal
johnson
v.
jones
and
mitchell
v.
forsythe,
then
yes.
this
is
the
supreme
court.
you
can
make
that
determination.
but
based
upon
the
prior
rulings
of
this
court,
this
court
is
bound
to
accept
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
courts
below,
and
then
to
determine
solely
the
legal
issue
on
an
interlocutory
basis.
the
bottom
line
issue
here,
your
honors,
is
whether
the
fact
that
someone
is
driving
in
violation
of
traffic
laws
in
and
of
itself
can
be
justification
for
the
use
of
deadly
force.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
underlying
violation
here.
i'm
talking
about
the
conduct
observed
by
the
officer
who
made
the
decision
to
use
deadly
force.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
this
is
the
issue.
if
what
this
person
is
doing
is
driving,
say
driving
unsafely,
but
they
are
not
driving
violently,
they
are
not
driving
aggressively,
they
are
not
menacing
anyone
on
the
road.
they
are
simply
driving
fast
trying
to
get
away,
that
in
and
of
itself,
is
that
going
to
be
justification
for
the
use
of
deadly
force
or
is
something
more
going
to
be
required?
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
under
garner
the
test
is
they
have
to
be
threatening
violence
or
inflicting
violence
against
someone.
there
have
to
be
no
other
alternatives
other
than
deadly
force
available
to
effect
the
apprehension.
and
assuming
there
is
justification
for
deadly
force,
then
there
is
a
duty
to
give
a
warning
where
feasible
before
using
deadly
force.
and
the
court
below
felt
none
of
those
three
factors--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--it's
academic
in
this
case,
because
the
first
two
factors
were
not
met.
i
mean,
it's
our
position
that
you
don't
worry
about
giving
a
warning
unless
you
have
the
right
to
use
deadly
force,
and
if
you
don't
get
to
that
point
then
it's...
it's
a
moot
question.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
there
was
certainly
warning
that
he
needed...
that
he
was
expected
to
pull
over.
there
was
no
warning
of
any
intent
to
use
deadly
force.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
i
didn't
see
that.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
i--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
the
point
is
most
people
use
the
word
weaving
to
describe
the
motion
of
mr.
harris's
car
is
when
they
are
going
through
the,
the
shopping
center--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--the...
feel
free
to
look
at
it
again.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
but
those
are
not
the
facts
that
were
found
by
the
court
below
in
this--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
i
think
you
apply
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well
in
theory
perhaps
they
could
be
if
the
officer
was
a
joint
proximate
cause
of
the
accident,
but
in
most
states--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--that's
correct.
if
the
officer
terminates
the
chase
then
he
is
never
going
to
be
liable
because
number
one
he
is
acting
prudently;
he
is
going
based
upon
department
of
justice
studies
showing
70
percent--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
if
he
terminates
the
chase
using
deadly
force,
that
that
creates
a
whole
host
of
other
problems.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
now
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
protect
other
people.
it
protects
those
who
have
been
seized.
and
that's,
that's
the
framework
we
are
dealing
with
here
today.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
the
potential
for
danger
to
others
is
certainly
part
of
the
justification
for
deadly
force,
just
as,
if
deadly
force
cannot
be
used
endangering
other
people,
then
that
certainly
goes
into
the
matrix,
too.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yeah.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
yes.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
this
is
my
point
is
that
if,
if
the
drive...
if
the
hazard
caused
by
driving
in
and
of
itself
is
the
only
threat
here,
does
that
rise
to
a
level
of
imminency
and
immediacy
that
justifies
the
use
of
deadly
force?
if
it
does,
then
any
officer
who
perceives
that
someone
is
driving
unsafely
and
that
they
may
cause
an
accident
to
someone
who
may
or
may
not
be
down
the
road
if
not
stopped,
would
be
justified
in
using
deadly
force,
to
literally
take
out
anyone
who
is
speeding.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well
that's--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--now
what
he,
if
he--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--absolutely.
or
because
he's
also--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
not
only
that,
justice
scalia.
the
officer
had
no
control
over
what
was
going
to
happen
once
he
used
deadly
force,
like
the
officer
who
fired
into
the
cab
of
a
flying
vehicle
in
barn
v
cox,
once
you
disable
the
driver
the
car
keeps
going.
and
in
this
case,
when
you...
when
you
hit
the
vehicle
and
knock
a
vehicle
that
has
been
in
control
and
make
it
out
of
control,
then
it's
now
an
unguided
missile
that
could
just
as
easily
cross
the
center
line
and
hit
an
innocent
person.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
the
officer--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--the
officer
has
both
options.
i
mean
garner
simply
commands
that
he
not
use
deadly
force
if
it's
a
choice
between
letting
him
go
and
using
deadly
force.
now
in
the
sacramento
v
lewis
case,
it
does
say
that
involves
a
different,
a
different
type
of
claim
and
a
different
standard.
but
in
the
sacramento
case
it
does
say
that
an
officer
in
a
pursuit
has
a
duty
to
always
be
weighing
the
risk
of
the
continued
pursuit
against
the
risk
to
the
public.
so
there
is
an
independent
duty
there
to
act
reasonably.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
not
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
the...
the
only
expert
testimony
in
this
record
on
that
subject
says
there
is
a
7
percent
chance--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--that's
what
garner
says,
if
you
don't
use
deadly
force.
and
that's
what
our
claim
is.
mr.
craig
t.
jones
well,
let
me
respond
by
reading
a
portion
of
garner
that
deals
with
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
these,
these
same
important
policy
reasons
were
raised
in
garner,
that
we
don't
want
to
encourage
disobedience
of
issues.
we
want
to
discourage
people
from
fleeing.
and
this
is
what
the
garner
court
said--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--yes.
he
might
easily
break
into
someone
else's
house
and
perhaps
end
up
killing
them.
this
was
a
vigorous
dissent
in
garner.
but
this
is
what
the
majority
said:
"without
in
any
way
disparaging
the
importance
of
these
goals
we
are
not
convinced
that
the
use
of
deadly
force
is
a
sufficiently
productive
means
of
accomplishing
them
to
justify
the
killing
of
nonviolent
suspects.
"
and
if
unsafe
driving--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
i
think
there
is
an
independent
duty,
it
doesn't
rise
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
there
is
an
independent
duty
to
do
that.
but
my
concern
is
that
under
garner,
given
a
choice
between--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
experience
shows
most
of
the
time
when
you
discontinue
a
chase,
the
person
who
is
running
discontinues
driving
unsafely.
that
is
the...
that
is
experience.
this
officer's
own
policy
says
that--
mr.
craig
t.
jones
--well,
the
rule
simply
says
you
don't
kill
him
just
because
he
is
driving
unsafely.
and
if,
it
simply
says
that
if
the
choice
is
between
killing
him
and
letting
him
go,
you
have
to
let
him
go
if
the
garner
factors
aren't
present.
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
law
and
no
reason
to
create
a
new
exception
in
the
law
that
says
that
garner
doesn't
apply
if
you're
fleeing
by
vehicle.
thank
you.
we
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
