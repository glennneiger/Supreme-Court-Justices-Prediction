what
test,
what
of
deadly
force
would
not
be
met
here?
justice

alito,

considering
that
it's
a
summary
judgment
issue.
justice
samuel

alito,
jr.
mr.
jones,
i
looked
at
the
videotape
on
this.
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
created
a
tremendous
risk
of
drivers
on
that
road.
is
that
an
unreasonable
way
of
looking
at
the...
at
this
tape?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
someone
is
fleeing
and
creating
a
grave
danger,
let's
just
assume
that
that's
the
case,
creating
a
very
danger
for
other
drivers
on
the
road,
when
in
your
view
is
it
reasonable
for
the
police
to
use
deadly
force
to
stop
that,
as
opposed
to
breaking
off
the
chase?
what,
what
is
the
test.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
could
you
possibly
give
a
warning
in
this
situation?
