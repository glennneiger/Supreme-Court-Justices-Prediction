mr.
philip
w.
savrin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
a
police
officer
could
be
held
personally
liable
for
using
force
to
terminate
a
dangerous
high-speed
pursuit.
the
undisputed
facts
show
that
deputy
scott
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
respondent
had
led
the
police
officers
on
a
nine-mile
pursuit
at
exceptionally
high
speeds.
as
the
videotapes
that
have
been
admitted
in
evidence
show,
respondent
was
driving
on
narrow
two-lane
roads
at
night.
he
swerved
across
the
double
line
to
pass
cars
that
were
in
his
path,
actually
traveling
in
the
wrong
lane
of
travel.
he
ran
through
a
number
of
red
lights.
he
weaved
through
a
shopping
center
and
collided
with
deputy
scott's
vehicle.
deputy
scott
at
that
point
had
tried
to
block
the
exit
from
the
shopping
center,
but
mr.
harris
was
successful
in
using
his
vehicle
to
escape.
at
that
point,
he
continued
driving
at
exceptionally
high
speeds.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
there
is
a...
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
factual
dispute
as
far
as
whether
deputy
scott's
vehicle
collided
with
mr.
harris'
vehicle
or
vice
versa,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
material
dispute.
we
believe
that
the
fact,
the
undisputed
fact,
that
mr.
harris
was
driving
at
such
exceptionally
high
rate
of
speeds...
and
to
put
in
context,
90
miles
per
hour,
which
is
the
average
speed,
and
of
course--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--but
scott...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
analysis.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
absolutely,
your
honor.
my
point
was
that,
the
point
was
that
there
was
a
collision,
not
who
caused
the
collision,
whether
the
deputy
pulled
into
mr.
harris'
line
of
travel
or
mr.
harris
pulled
towards
the
deputy.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
your
honor...
yes,
essentially.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
believe--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--greater
than
not
taking
action.
in
other
words,
that
the
harm--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
one
thing
i
did
want
to
point
out
is
that
a
speed
of
90
miles
per
hour...
and
of
course
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
vehicles
were
at
times
traveling
over
100
miles
an
hour--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--yes,
that's
probably
a
better
articulation.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i
think
that's
a
better
articulation
of
what
the
appropriate
test
would
be,
the
way--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
question
would
be
that
that's
always
going
to
be
the
case
whenever
force
is
used
to
stop
a
vehicle
at
this
high
rate
of
speed.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
and
to
put
it
in
a
more
complete
perspective,
90
miles
an
hour
is
mathematically
equivalent
to
over
130
feet
per
second.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
well,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that,
that
in
fact--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--the
initial
offense
was
speeding,
and
mr.
harris,
instead
of
pulling
over
or
slowing
down
as
would
might
be
expected
by
a
reasonable
person,
sped
up
and
continued
to
drive
recklessly.
we
would
contend
that
it
was
mr.
harris
that
was
in
control
of
the
force
that
the
officers
need
to
terminate,
the
risk
that
he
presented.
at
any
time,
any
time,
mr.
harris
could
have
either
slowed
down
his
vehicle
or
stopped,
and
he
chose
not
to
do
that.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i
think
it
depends
on
how
you
define
deadly
force.
of
course,
there
can
be
different--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--i
think
that,
that
would
be
the
case,
as
i
indicated,
whenever
an
officer
uses
force
to
stop
a
vehicle
at
this
speed.
i
think
there
is...
if
it
is
deadly
force,
and
of
course
this
court
has
not
articulated
a
test
of
that
particular
question--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--in
this
case?
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
no,
the
district
court
found
that
it
did
not
need
to
resolve
whether
or
not--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
the
jury
might
conclude
it
was
deadly
force.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i
believe,
again,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
how
broad
the
test
is.
the
model
penal
code
test,
which
most
of
the
circuit
courts--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--i
believe,
yes,
under,
under
the
test
as
articulated
in
some
of
the
circuits,
yes,
this
would
not
be
deadly
force.
of
course,
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--your
honor,
as
i
read
the
garner
opinion,
the
court
did
not
need
to
reach
a
definition
of
deadly
force
because
shooting
someone
in
the
back
of
the
head
is
clearly
going
to
be
deadly
force.
the
circuit
courts...
i
can
tell
you
that
the
circuit
courts
in
the
wake
of
garner
have
said
that
garner
did
not
create
a
test
and
have
created
different
tests
along
the
lines
of
the
model
penal
code
to
reach
that
definition.
but
the
point...
i
was
going
to
say
a
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
there
are
degrees
even
within
the
continuum
that
might
be
within
a
definition
of
deadly
force,
such
as
using
a
vehicle
to
make
contact,
blowing
out
the
tires,
using
stop
sticks,
using
a
firearm.
those
have
different
degrees
of
potential
lethality,
so
even
if
they
are
all
considered
deadly
force
there
are
decisions
that
an
officer
has
to
make.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
a
likelihood--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
third
circuit
decision
in
the
philadelphia
litigation
case,
where
the
officers
dropped
a
bomb
on
a
building
in
order
to
gain
access
and
they
ended
up
killing
11
people.
the
court
found
that
that
was
not
deadly
force
because
the
officers
were
trying
to
gain
access
to
the
building
and
they
reasonably
believe
that
they
were
able
to
do
that
without
the
loss
of
life.
i
think
that
if
that
definition
were
applied
to
this
case,
then
i
think
that
this
would
not
be
deadly
force.
but
i
think--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--i'm
sorry.
i
keep
interrupting
you.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
your
honor,
his
intent
was
to
end
the
pursuit,
not
to
cause
an
accident.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
well,
let
me
cite
another
case
then,
the
adams
case
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
i--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--let
me
cite
the
court
to
the
eleventh
circuit's
own
reasoning
in
the
adams
case.
and
that
case
involves
a
misdemeanant
where
the
officer
intentionally
made
contact
with
the
vehicle
several
times.
the
last
contact
caused
the
death
of
a
passenger.
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
garner
did
not
apply
to
that
situation
and
further
said
that
a
policeman's
use
of
his
vehicle
is
very
different
from
a
policeman's
use
of
his
gun.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
because
there
are
vehicle
collisions
every
day,
your
honor,
that
do
not
end
in
death
or
serious
bodily
harm.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
your
honor,
because
mr.
harris
could
have
regained
control
of
his
vehicle.
the
point
is
that
mister...
that
the
petitioner
had
limited
options
based
on
the
manner
in
which
mr.
harris
was
driving.
even
if
this
would
be
considered
deadly
force,
we
do
believe
it
would
be
justified
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i
believe
in
the
context
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
graham
factors
and
the
question
of
probable
cause,
that
it's
not
the
same
as
simply
a
jury
question.
but
i
do
concede
that
if
it's
not
deadly
force
it's
very
close
to
it.
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that,
whatever
force
mister...
the
petitioner
used
was
limited
by
mr.
harris'
driving.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
your
honor,
if
i
could
respond
to
that
in
two
respects.
first,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
pit
maneuver,
as
it's
commonly
called,
is
safe.
what
it
does
is
spin
the
car
out,
and
if
mr.
harris'
vehicle
had
been
spun
out
in
this
case
it
is
more
likelihood
that
he
would
have
lost
control.
in
other
words,
it
causes
the
vehicle
to
lose
control.
the
second
response
i
would
have
is
that
the
petitioner
did
ask
permission
to
do
the
pit
maneuver
and
the
permission
that
the
supervisor
gave,
which
was
mr.
faninger
that's
in
the
record
undisputed,
was
to
use
force
up
to
deadly
force.
so
mr.--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--that's
in
mark
faninger's
deposition,
and
he
is
the
supervisor
that
was--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--yes,
your
honor.
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
giving,
he
believes
he
was
giving
permission
up
to
and
including
deadly
force.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
officer
had
very
limited
options,
two
options
at
that
point:
either
use
force
or
let
mr.
harris
go.
and
i
think
it
was
a
balancing
of--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--yes,
there
always
are
other
potentials.
however,
i
would
submit
that
a
vehicle
traveling
at
130
feet
per
second
can
do
a
lot
of
damage
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
before
the
police
officers
can
figure
out
what
route
he's
going
to
take.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
deputy
scott
took
the
action
that
he
did
because
there
was
a
low
likelihood
of
injury
to
third
parties
other
than
to
mr.
harris
because
there
was
no
one
in
his
immediate
path
of
travel.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
because
there
were...
the
videotape
shows
that
mr.
harris
passed
approximately
36
cars
during
this
period
of
time.
12
seconds
before
the
contact
was
made,
a
vehicle
was
passed
by
mr.
harris.
there
was
a
high
likelihood,
in
fact
a
probability,
that
this
case
was
going
to
end
in
tragedy,
and
deputy
scott
took
the
action
that
he
could.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
whether
he
discontinued
the
chase
or
not,
mr.
harris
could
still
injure
whoever
might
be
around
the
next
corner,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
refocus
for
a
moment
that
in
order
for
the
officer
to
be
denied
qualified
immunity
in
this
context
a
jury
would
have
to
be
able
to
find
two
things.
one,
that
no...
that
there
was
no
probable
cause,
and
second,
that
that
was
clearly
established.
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
this
morning
if
nothing
else
shows
that
it's
not
clearly
established.
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
i
think
the
measure
needs
to
be
exactly
as
this
court
stated
in
graham
versus
connor,
which
is
looking
at
the
facts
from
the
standpoint
of
the
officer
on
the
scene,
because
after
all,
he
has
to
make
split-second
decisions.
he
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
taking
depositions
of
mr.
harris--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
was
provided
in
this
decision
in
ornelas
versus
united
states,
a
decision
by
this
court
in
1996
that
came
up
in
the
context
of
a
criminal,
a
direct
criminal
appeal
involving
the
question
of
probable
cause.
and
this
court
set
forth
very
clearly
that
the
historical
facts
are
given
deference.
the
question
of,
a
legal
question
about
whether
those
facts
reasonably
give
rise
to
probable
cause
is
an
independent
de
novo
review.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
i
don't
believe
that
is
historical
fact.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
the
historical
facts
here
are
whether
mr.
harris
was
driving
excessively,
whether
he
was
driving
across
the
line,
whether
he
was
driving
at
high
rates
of
speed,
whether
there
was
anybody
in
his
path,
whether
he
had
collided
with
anyone.
i
think
the
question
about
whether
or
not
those
facts
give
rise
to
probable
cause
to
believe
that
harris
was
a
threat
of
serious
physical
harm
is
a
legal
issue,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
in
this
case
when
they
applied
a
different
analysis
or
came
out
with
a
different
result
to
those
same
undisputed
facts.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
and
that
is
a
fact
that
we
accept
as
true
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
the
tape
shows
that
there
was
a
vehicle
just
12
seconds
before,
and
i
think
that
a
reasonable
officer
at
the
time
would
believe
that
that
wasn't
going
to
be
the
last
vehicle
on
that
road.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
yes,
your
honor.
exactly.
he
had
limited
options
and
i
believe
it
was
a
no-win
scenario.
and
he
took
the
best
course
that
he
reasonably
believed
he
could
at
the
time.
and--
mr.
philip
w.
savrin
--i
would
not,
your
honor.
in
our
brief
we
did
list
a
number
of
felonies
that
mr.
harris,
that
we
believe
he
committed.
but
i
would
go
back
to
garner,
and
garner
says
that
an
armed
suspect
would
have
been
a
different
case.
and
garner
also
says
that
some
misdemeanors
such
as
drunk
driving
are
more
dangerous
that
some
felonies
such
as
white
collar
crime.
so
i
think
the
question
should
not
be
whether
it's
a
technical
issue
of
crossing
the
line
from
misdemeanor
to
felony,
but
the
harm
that
is
being
caused
by
the
continued
driving
that's
exactly
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
if
i
could
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
what
to
do
in
terms
of
responding
to
mr.
marx's
question,
i
think
the
ornelas
case
says
that
you
would
review
it
for
clear
error.
and
in
this
case
you
would
not
owe
deference
of
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
lower
court.
