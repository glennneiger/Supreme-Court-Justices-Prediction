but
mr.
savrin,
there
was
an
episode
in
the
parking
lot
where
things
came
to
a
temporary
halt.
if
scott
had
stopped
pursuing
harris
at
that
point,
maybe
harris
would
not...
maybe
he
would
have
slowed
down.
if
he
was...
he
was
trying
to
flee
from
the
police,
but
if
the
police
weren't
after
him
there
is
no
indication
that
he
would
have
been
speeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
savrin,
one
technique
that
officer
scott
asked
permission
to
use
was
described
as
a
pit
technique
that
would
be
a
life
and
limb...
sparing
measure.
one
oddity
about
this
case
is
that
he
called
and
asked
permission
to
use
that
less
risky
method
and
yet
when
he
determined
that
he
couldn't
do
that,
given
the
speed
of
the
vehicles,
he
didn't
ask
permission
to
do
what
he
did
do,
which
was
life-endangering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
said
he
gave
permission
for
more
than
pit
procedure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
deal
with
the
brower
case?
that
it
was
a
193...
83
action
against
the
police
for
setting
up
a
roadblock
to
catch
a
speeder.
and
the
court
said
that
the
roadblock
was
enough
to
give
rise
to
a
1983
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
case
at
the
time
of
the
action
in
this
case,
any
decision
that
said
ramming,
ramming
a
car
to
end
a
chase
violates
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
brower
was
a
roadblock
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
certainly
committed
a
lot
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
key
point
is
that
he
is
endangering
the
lives
and
safety
of
others.
anyone
who
has
watched
that
tape
has
got
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
looking
at
the
road
and
the
way
that
this
car
was
swerving,
and
the
cars
coming
in
the
opposite
direction.
this
was
a
situation
fraught
with
danger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wasn't
there
warning?
there
were
lights,
there
were
sirens.
surely
the
defendant
knew
that
the
police
were
trying
to
stop
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the,
the
court
saying...
and
this
is
on
page
39
a
of
the
petition
appendix...
when
harris
was
driving
away
from
officers
and
when
there,
when
there
were
no
other
motorists
or
pedestrians
nearby,
thus
casting
doubt
on
defendant's
assertion
that
at
the
time
of
the
ramming,
harris
posed
an
immediate
threat
of
harm
to
others.
this
is
a
finding
that
there
were
no
other
motorists
or
pedestrians
nearby
when
the
ramming
occurred.
