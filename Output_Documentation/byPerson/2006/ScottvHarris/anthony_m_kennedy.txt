justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
rule
that
you
propose
that
the
policeman
must
balance
the
risk
of
harm
to
others
versus
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
fleeing
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
brief
says
that
the
officer
reasonably
believes
that
doing
so,
i.e.,
terminating
the
chase,
would
avoid
a
greater
risk
of
bodily
injury
or
death.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
greater
than
what?
greater
than--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--without
reference
to
the
possible
harm
to
the
driver?
i
just
want
to
know
what
you're
testing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
mean
to
put
words
in
your
mouth.
it
seems
to
me
your
test
might
be
whether
there
is
a
greater
risk
in
stopping
him
or
not
stopping
him
as
to
other
people,
without
reference
to
the
risk
to
himself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
your
brief.
i
want
you
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
we
had
a
test
for
deadly
force
in
garner
and
it's
whether
or
not
there
is...
it's
more
likely
than
not,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
serious
risk
that
death
will
ensue.
that's
the
test,
garner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a
different
issue
and
you
may
prevail
on
other
arguments
in
the
case.
but
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
likelihood
or
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
serious
injury,
it
seems
to
me
that's
clearly
a
question
for
the
jury.
i
mean,
we
might
argue
about
it
up
here,
but
that's
classic
jury
question,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
think
that
would
apply
to
all
high-speed
cases;
would
you
not
agree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
would
be
the
same
even
if
scott
knew
that
the
only
reason
they
were
trying
to
stop
him
initially
was
the
speeding
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
used
the
turning
signal.
that's
like
the
strangler
who
observes
the
no
smoking
sign.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
through
a
question
earlier,
isn't
it
reasonable
for
an
officer
to
assume
that
it
is...
he
is
trying
to
escape
because
there
is
something
more
serious
than
speeding
at
stake?
i
mean,
that's
the
assumption
i
would
draw.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
just
as
many
people
take
off
in
high
speed
chases
for
speeding
as
for
serious
crimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
as
of
the
time
he
exited
the
parking
lot,
by
that
point,
had
he
committed
any
felonies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
90
miles
an
hour
would
not
be
a
felony,
not
a
reckless
driving?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
no
point
did
he
commit
a
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
he
had
intended
to
hit
the
police
officer,
was
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
district--
[laughter]
under,
under...
under
your
rule,
what
you're
concerned
with
is
the
bumping,
the
use
of
the
force.
under
your
rule,
if
the
police
continue
the
chase
without
using
the,
without
trying
to
ram
him,
and
then
there
is
an
accident
and
innocent
people
are
killed,
or
injured,
i
assume
that
under
the
tort
laws
of
most
states,
the
police
could
be
liable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
aren't
they
the
proximate
cause
if
they
continue
the
chase
without
trying
to
terminate
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
well,
i
meant
terminate
the
chase
by...
by...
by
forcing
him
off
the
road.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
there...
but
isn't
that
one
way
to
assure
that
the
police
are
not
liable,
both
from
a
moral
standpoint
and
a
legal
standpoint,
for
causing
the
injury
of
other
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
mean
it's
irrelevant
to
our
analysis
to
consider
that
he
might
injure
other
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your,
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
it
was
the
police
not
have
the
duty
to
discontinue
the
chase?
the
obverse
of
that
is
that
the
police
may
prolong
the
chase,
i.e.,
prolong
the
injury
to
the
public.
i'm
surprised
at
your
answer.
