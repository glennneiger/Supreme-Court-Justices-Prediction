justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
at
issue
as
far
as
this
mootness
question
goes.
i
mean,
you're
seeking
to
have
the
right
to
file
under
13.
and
if,
in
fact,
there's
no
eligibility
to
file
under
13,
you're
asking
for
the
impossible.
the
case
is
simply...
you
know...
it's
just
air.
so
i
guess,
perhaps
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
case
is
still
on
appeal.
should
we
not
take
as
a
given
that
there
is
a
judgment
that
you
don't
qualify
for
13,
and
yet
you're
coming
before
us
asking
us
to
say
that
you
can
apply
under
chapter
13.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
didn't
you
make
that
argument
to
the
bankruptcy
court
that
found
that
you
were
not
eligible?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
asking.
a
chapter
7
debtor
doesn't,
but
a
chapter
13
debtor
presumably
does.
so
didn't
you
make
the
same
argument
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
rejected
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
about
the
present
case.
i
care
about
the
chapter
13
case
in
which
you
have
been
found
not
to
qualify
for
chapter
13
treatment.
didn't
you
make
before
that
court
the
same
argument
you're
making
now
that
some
of
the
debts
shouldn't
be
counted.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
rejected
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
rejected
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
said
it
was
only
a
chapter
7
debtor
who
couldn't
object.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
applying
under
chapter
13.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
you
object
to
that
and
say
you
should
look
at
these
claims
afresh?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
did
the
court
say?
did
it
say
it
had
to
or
that
it
did
so
and
still
found
them
over
the
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
bankruptcy
court
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
but
did
it
reduce
it
to
a
level
that
you
qualified
for
chapter
13
treatment?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
are.
they've
rendered
a
decision.
how
could
you
not
be
finished
with
the
claims
objection
process
if
the
bankruptcy
court
has
rendered
a
final
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
terribly
confusing.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chapter
13
bankruptcy
court
had
the
responsibility
for
determining
whether
you
qualified
under
the,
you
know,
under
the
amount
of
debt.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
objected
to
that,
i
gather?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
objected
to
that,
to
that
ruling?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
baker,
i
have...
i
have
a
question
on
a
matter
that
really
upsets
me
and
causes
me
to
wonder
how,
you
know,
how
much
we
can
rely
upon
your
description
here.
you
claimed
in
the
petition
that
the
reason
your
client
filed
under
chapter
7
rather
than
13
was
that
he
was
unemployed
at
the
time.
and
that
he
decided
to
go
to
13
after
he
became
employed.
yet,
on...
as
shown
in
the
supplemental
appendix,
when
he
filed
under
chapter
7,
under
penalty
of
perjury,
he
said
that
he
was
employed,
and
at
the
meeting
of
the
creditors,
he
confirmed
under
oath
that
he
was
employed.
what
was
it?
was
he
employed
or
not
employed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
employment,
occupation,
name
of
employer:
capital
carpet
and
flooring.
how
long
employed,
five
months.
address
of
employment:
woburn,
massachusetts.
it
also
says
the
same
thing
on
page
18
of
the
supplemental
appendix.
and
also
with
the
meeting
of
creditors.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
64a,
he
says
the
same
thing
that
he
was
employed.
was
he
employed
or
not
employed?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
go
around
swearing
he
was
when
he
wasn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
look
on
page
64a
of
the
appendix,
the
meeting
of
creditors.
trustee
says
okay,
and
you
now
work
for
another
entity,
capital
carpet
and
flooring,
sir?
and
mark
marrama
says
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
second
circuit's
decision
a
decision
that
said
the
court
didn't
have
the
power
because
it
had
not
been
moved
to
take
that
action
by
the
party
who
had
the
responsibility
for
raising
the
issue?
was
that
the
basis
for
the
second
circuit's
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
then...
then
you
haven't
contradicted
what
the
chief
justice
suggested.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brunstad,
are
you
going
to
address
the
mootness
point?
do
you
think
the
case
is
moot?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
the
jurisdictional
objection
before
the
second
bankruptcy
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case,
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
trustee
do?
he's
not
really
a
trustee
under
13,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
property
doesn't
vest
in
him,
you've
told
it.
it
remains
in
the
ownership
of
the
debtor?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
called
a
trustee,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that's
really
not
his
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
called
chapter
13
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
government
have
any
position
on
the
mootness
question
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
what
you
just
said.
you
said
until
the
plan
is
filed
and
approved
the
property
remains
in
the
possession
of
the
chapter
13
trustee.
