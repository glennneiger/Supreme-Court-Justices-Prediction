justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
district
court...
pardon
me.
could
the
bankruptcy
court
make
that
same
determination
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
chapter
7
proceeding
to
be
converted?
he
could
make
this
inquiry
in
a
chapter
7
proceeding?
he
says:
i
don't
think
you
should
be
able
to
convert
because
there's
a
fraud,
but
i'll
look
at
how
the
creditors
come
out.
could
he
do
that?
and
then
you
don't
have
the
specter
that
justice
souter
referred
to
of
this
transfer
back
and
then
the
transfer
back,
which
is
a
waste
of
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
they
just
have
an
order
to
the
bankrupt...
to
disclose
the
asset
in
the
chapter
13
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
chapter
13
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this
case
they
knew
about
it,
didn't
they?
