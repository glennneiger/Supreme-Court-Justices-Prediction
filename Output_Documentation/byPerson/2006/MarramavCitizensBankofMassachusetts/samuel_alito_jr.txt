justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
come
back
to
a
prior
question.
unless
there
is
some
different
procedure
required
when...
between
the
two
situations
of
denial
of
conversion
from
7
to
13
and
allowing
conversion
but
with
immediate
reconversion
back
to
7,
unless
there's
some
difference
between
that's
required
by
the
code
in
those
two
situations,
maybe
it
is
because
you
have
to...
in
the
reconversion
situation,
you
have
to
wait
until
the
plan
is
filed.
maybe
it's
because
the
bad
faith
doesn't
carry
over.
but
unless
there's
some
difference,
i
don't
see
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can't
provide
any
reason
why
there's
a
difference
between
those
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
deny...
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
court
could
simultaneously
convert
on
the
motion
of
the
debtor
from
7
to
13
and
during
the
20-day
period
that's
required
by
the
rule,
the
rules,
reconvert?
do
you
dispute
that,
for
bad
faith?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it
gives
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
during
the
20
day
period...
you
have
to
give
20
days
notice
before
the
conversion
takes
place;
is
that
correct,
from
7
to
13?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it
has
the
hearing
during
that
period,
you
don't
dispute
that
the
court
could
do
that,
or
do
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
isn't
the
power
to
reconvert
sufficient?
