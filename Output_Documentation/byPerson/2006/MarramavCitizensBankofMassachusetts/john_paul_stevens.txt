justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
i
may
have
missed
some
of
the
colloquy
here...
is
it
correct
that
he
would
not
be
eligible
to
file
a...
to
have
a,
institute
a
chapter
13
proceeding
if
he
had
unsecured
debts
of
over
a
certain
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
at
the
time
he
makes
the
motion
to
convert,
which
you
say
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
make,
what
if
the
record
then
disclosed
that
he
had
debts
exceeding
that
amount?
what
should
the
bankruptcy
judge
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
concludes
they're
over
the
amount?
so
it
is
clear
under
the
record.
what
should
he
do
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
should
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
in
all
cases
to
convert,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
if
the
remedy
of
not
allowing
them
to
convert
to
chapter
13
is
denied,
are
there
other
remedies
that
the
bankruptcy
court
can
impose
against
the
debtor
who
engages
in
misconduct
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
criminal
sanctions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
are
the
creditors
hurt
by
this
series
of
events?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
a
chapter
7
case
be
refiled
immediately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
creditors
aren't
going
to
let
him
just
run
away
with
the
assets,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whenever
he
denies
the
motion,
he
must
know
about
it.
he
must
have
a
reason
to
deny.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clear
up
one
detail
that's
confusing
to
me.
the...
are
there
two
judges?
does
the
same
judge
rule
on
both
the
motion
to
convert
and
the
motion
to
reconvert?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case.
the
petitioner
filed
a
voluntary
petition
to
discharge
his
debts
under
chapter
7
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
in
verified
schedules
attached
to
his
petition,
petitioner
made
several
statements
about
his
principal
asset;
a
house
in
maine
that
turned
out
to
be
misleading
or
inaccurate.
after
petitioner’s
examination
of
the
meeting
of
creditors
required
by
the
code,
the
trustee
of
the
state
indicated
his
intention
to
recover
the
maine
property
as
an
asset
of
the
state.
petitioner
then
moved
to
convert
his
case
to
a
case
under
chapter
13.
proceeding
under
chapter
13,
enables
a
debtor
with
regular
income
to
retain
possession
of
his
property
and
to
discharge
his
debts
as
he
completes
payment
of
a
plan
approved
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
petitioner’s
conversion
request
on
the
ground
that
the
motion
had
been
made
in
bad
faith.
both
the
bankruptcy
panel
for
the
first
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
a
chapter
7
debtor
has
an
absolute
right
to
convert
to
chapter
13,
not
withstanding
or
finding
by
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
conversion
motion
was
brought
in
bad
faith.
we
affirm,
section
706(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
a
debtor
may
convert
a
case
under
chapter
7
to
a
case
under
chapter
11,
12
or
13
at
any
time,
if
the
case
had
not
previously
been
converted,
relying
primarily
on
this
language
as
well
as
the
language
in
the
house
in
senate
committee
reports
on
the
provision.
petitioner
argues
that
he
has
an
unqualified
one
time
right
to
convert
to
chapter
13,
we
disagree.
under
section
706(d)
of
the
code,
a
chapter
7
debtor
may
not
convert
to
chapter
13
unless
he
is
eligible
to
be
a
chapter
13
debtor.
under
1307(c),
section
1307(c)
provides
a
non-exhaustive
list
of
reasons
that
constitute
cause
for
dismissal
of
a
chapter
13
debtor’s
case
because
bankruptcy
courts
routinely
pre-petition
bad
faith
conduct
as
one
such
cause.
it
follows
that
a
chapter
7
debtor,
who
has
been
determined
to
have
acted
in
bad
faith,
maybe
deemed
ineligible
to
convert
to
chapter
13.
in
addition,
section
105(a)
of
the
court
which
provides
that
a
bankruptcy
court
may
take
any
action
necessary
or
appropriate
to
prevent
an
abusive
process
authorizes
the
court
to
deny
a
motion
to
convert
to
chapter
13,
when
due
to
the
debtor’s
bad
faith
conduct,
the
chapter
13
case
is
destined
for
immediate
dismissal
or
re-conversion
to
chapter
7.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
