mr.
david
g.
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
706(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
a
debtor
may
convert
a
case
under
chapter
7
to
a
case
under
any
other
chapter
of
the
bankruptcy
code
at
any
time
if
the
case
has
not
been
converted
previously
from
another
chapter,
and
that
any
waiver
of
the
right
to
convert
a
case
under
the
subsection
is
unenforceable.
other
subsections
of
section
706
give
rules
for
the
court
to
decide
about
conversion
in
the
case
where
some
party
other
than
the
debtor
requests
conversion
of
the
case
and
also
provides
that
the
conversion
must
lead
to
a
chapter
to
which
that
debtor
is
qualified
to
be
a
debtor.
mr.
david
g.
baker
in
the
present
case
or
the
new
case?
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
circumstances
of
the
new
case
are
entirely
different.
in
fact,
in
that...
in
the
present...
the
new
case,
the
court
decided
that
he
was
not
eligible
because
his
debt
limit
exceeded
the
statutory
limitations
that
exist
section
109(e).
there
is
a
three-year
time
span
between
the
two,
and
we
believe
that
the
existing
case
is
not
moot
because
he
still
has
remedies
that
he
can
obtain
in
chapter
13.
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
in
the
present
case
because
the
eligibility
was
never
questioned
below,
was
never
a
factor
below.
mr.
david
g.
baker
in
the
prior
case?
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
first,
because
as
i
mentioned,
the
issue
of
eligibility
within
the
monetary
limits
was
never
raised
below.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
his
schedules
in
the
supplemental
joint
appendix,
he
is
clearly
within
the
statutory
limits
based...
just
looking
at
his
schedules.
mr.
david
g.
baker
the...
well,
the...
the
bankruptcy
court
made
a
decision
in
the
current
case,
the
new
case,
but
they
haven't
dismissed
it.
dismissal
is
in
fact
on
appeal
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
reason
is,
in
our
view
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
new
case
incorrectly
looked
back
to
the
claims
that
had
been
filed
in
the
prior
case.
now,
it
is
a
difficult
issue
in
some
respects
because
there
is
case
law
at
least
in
massachusetts
or
the
first
circuit
that
says
a
debtor
does
not
have
standing
to
object
to
claims
in
a
chapter
7
case.
so
the
fact
that
a
number
of
claims
were
filed
and
argued
doesn't
relate
to,
in
a
prior
case,
does
not
have
a
preclusive
effect
in
the
new
case.
now
we
did,
in
fact,
object
to
quite
a
number
of
claims
and
the
eligibility,
and
i
think
that
ultimately
once
the
claim
objections
are
resolved,
we
will
be
within
the
statutory
limits.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i'm...
i
don't
quite
follow
the
question.
would
you
mind
restating
it?
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes,
your
honor,
because
there's
a
three-year
difference
between
the
two
and
substantially
different
facts.
the...
we
have
to
go
back,
i
think,
to
the
case
that's
at
bar,
because
it
is
those
claims,
the
claims
that
were
filed
in
the
current
case
that
are
the
issue.
as
i
say,
we
are
in
the
process
of
doing
objections
to
those
claims
and
i
think
that
ultimately
we
will
come
within
them.
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
i
would
respectfully
say...
suggest
that
it
does,
your
honor,
because
once...
we
don't
really
get
to
the
eligibility
question
until
the
court
below
considers
it
in
the
context
of
the
case
that's
at
bar.
we
have
to,
as
i
say,
we
are
in
the
process
of
objecting
to
claims
and
resolving
them.
now
the--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--no,
your
honor,
because
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
case
law
in
the
first
circuit
up
to
this
point
has
held
that
a
chapter
7
debtor
does
not
have
standing
to
object
to
claims.
now
in
the
new
case,
in
fact,
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--in
the
old
case,
yes,
once
we
converted
the
chapter.
mr.
david
g.
baker
no.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
no,
we
did
not
address
eligibility
in
the
present
case.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
did.
mr.
david
g.
baker
pardon?
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
bankruptcy
court
did
reject
it,
yes.
but
they
rejected
it
because,
as
i
say,
up
to
that
point
the
case
law
had
held
that
we
did
not
have
standing
to
object
to
the
claims,
so
we
were
bound
by
what
was
there.
mr.
david
g.
baker
right.
mr.
david
g.
baker
right.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
in
the
previous
chapter
7
case
we
lacked
standing
to
object
to
those
claims
and
that
in
the
new
chapter
13
case
the
court
took
the
chapter
7
case
claims
and
said,
you're
bound
by
these
in
the
new
chapter
13
case.
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes.
mr.
david
g.
baker
it...
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
new
case
said...
pardon?
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
new
case
said
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
a
debtor
would
have
standing.
this
was
in
effect
a
new
rule
of
law
for
that,
for
this
district.
so
subsequent
to
that
decision
we
did,
in
fact,
object
to
quite
a
number
of
claims
and
substantially
reduced
the
total
of
those
claims,
and
i
think
that
once--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--the
bankruptcy
court
sustained
our
objections
to
those
claims
and
in
fact
reduced
the
total
substantially.
mr.
david
g.
baker
we
are
not
finished
with
the
claims
objection
process.
i
believe
that
once
we
are--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--because
the
bankruptcy
court
rendered
a
final
decision
which
is
on
appeal
in
the
new
case.
we
are
objecting
to
the
chapter
7
claims
in
the
old
case.
i
apologize
if
this
is
confusing.
mr.
david
g.
baker
and
it
did
so
by
reference
to
the
claims
that
had
been
filed
in
the
previous
chapter
7
case.
we
can't
object
to
claims
in
a
chapter
13
case
that
haven't
been
filed.
so
procedurally,
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
chapter
7
case
and
do
the
claims
objections
within
the
context
of
the
old
chapter
7
case.
now,
in
the
chapter
13
case
we
used
the...
the
bankruptcy
court
used
the
total
of
those
claims
that
had
been
filed
in
the
chapter
7
case
to
determine
eligibility
in
the
13.
in
doing
so,
the
bankruptcy
court
basically
announced
a
new
rule
of
law
that
the
claims
that
had
been
filed
would
be
essentially
i
suppose,
res
judicata
in
the
subsequent
case,
but
that
in
some
cases
a
chapter
7
debtor--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--sorry?
mr.
david
g.
baker
not
necessarily,
because
it
does
give
you
a
vehicle
to
go
back
to
the
old
chapter
7
case
and
do
the
procedural
claims
objections
in
that
case,
which
is
what
we
did,
and
we
substantially
reduced
the
total
of
the
claims.
mr.
david
g.
baker
a
determination
of
no
discharge
had
been
entered.
however,
it
was
an
asset
case,
so
it
remains
open,
it
remains
open
at
this
point,
until
the
chapter
7
trustee
makes
a
distribution
to
creditors
or
files
his
final
report
with
the
court.
it
has
not
been
dismissed.
mr.
david
g.
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i'm
sorry.
would
you
repeat
that?
mr.
david
g.
baker
not
if
there's
no
chapter
13.
mr.
david
g.
baker
if
the
debtor
dies?
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
there
is
a
rule,
i
believe
it's--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--right.
i
think
the
rule
2009
says,
the
federal
rules
of
bankruptcy--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--well,
again,
your
honor,
the
rule
says--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--the
statute
is
plain,
your
honor.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
think
that
the
statute
is
plain
and
says
that
the
debtor
may
convert.
mr.
david
g.
baker
even
if
he's
insane.
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
bankruptcy
court
could
certainly
do
that.
the
procedural
safeguards
of
due
process
require,
obviously,
notice
and
hearing
of
the
court's
reasons
for
wanting
to
say
that.
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
i
wouldn't
say
he
could
immediately
reconvert.
again,
there
is
the
due
process
requirement
that
the
debtor
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
issue.
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes.
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
perhaps,
but
it
is
the
system
that
congress
has
given
us.
congress
has
said
the
debtor
may
convert
at
any
time
so
long
as
it
has
not
been
converted
previously.
mr.
david
g.
baker
most
of
the
time,
a
plan
is...
i
don't
do
it
this
way,
but
most
practitioners
will
file
a
plan
at
the
same
time
as
they
file
the
notice,
the
motion
to
convert.
mr.
david
g.
baker
they
don't
have
to.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
suppose
arguably
it
could.
in
my
view,
the
statutory
provisions
of
section
1307
have
to
be
applied
to
the
question
of
conversion.
so
i
think--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
g.
baker
exactly.
and
i
think
it's
the
tenth
circuit
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
noted
that
sometimes
a
problem
debtor
files
a
plan
and
gets
it
confirmed,
pays
creditors,
and
everybody
winds
up
better
off.
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
again,
the
statute
says
that
the
debtor
may
convert
except
in
certain
circumstances.
i
think
that
the
requirement
of
a
motion
to
convert
a
case
gives
the
court
the
procedural
mechanism
for
looking
at
the
case,
seeing,
making
sure
that
the
debtor--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--because
ultimately
the
chapter
13
trustee
has
the
same
powers
of
the
chapter
7
trustee
with
the
exception,
as
your
honor
is
pointing
out,
of
possession
of
the
property
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
but
that's
how
congress
wrote
the
statute.
we
should
not
ignore
congress's
command
about
the
process
of
converting
and
look
for
exceptions
before
we
proceed
to
go
back
to
the
appellate
court--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--well,
ultimately
the
case
is
about
the
language
of
the
statute
and
whether
the
court
should
apply
it
as
written.
and
i
think--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
dispute
that
the
court
could
do
it
sua
sponte
and
without
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
mr.
david
g.
baker
i
believe
that's
correct.
when
you
file
a
motion,
a
20
day
notice
is
required,
yes.
mr.
david
g.
baker
well,
again
we
come
to
the
question
of
when
the
plan
gets
filed.
the
plan
isn't
filed
until
after
it's
converted,
according
to
the
rules.
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
procedure
i
would,
i
would
expect
to
see
is
that
if
the
court
saw
an
issue
of
fact
with
respect
to
whether
the
case
had
been
converted
or
whether
the
debtor
was
eligible
for
it
to
be
a
debtor
in
the
chapter
to
which
he
seeks
conversion,
then
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
required.
if...
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
particular
case
here,
i
think,
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
recognize
the
fact
that
most
issues
in
bankruptcy
court
are
decided
summarily
on
motion
practice.
and
it
is
my
feeling
that,
the
jurisprudence
of
rule
56
has
to
apply.
if
a
court
sees
that
there
are
disputed
issues
of
fact,
the
court
must
schedule
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it
cannot,
it
cannot
simply
grant
summary
judgment
without
furtherance
issue
of
fact.
so
this
is
why
i
say
that,
that
on
these
two...
the
two
particular
points...
and
obviously,
the
question
of
whether
it
has
been
previously
converted
is
very
easy
to
determine.
but
as
previously
discussed,
the
issue
of
eligibility,
whether
the
claims
and
the
debt
is
within
the
statutory
limitation,
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
ultimately
might
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
david
g.
baker
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
because
in
our
view
the
schedules...
excuse
me...
in
our
view
the
schedules
in
this
case
clearly
indicate
that
it...
that
he
was
within
the
statutory
limitations,
at
least
as
far
as
the
schedules
go.
mr.
david
g.
baker
on
the
petition
date
itself,
he
was
not.
and
if
you
look
at
schedule
i,
which
is
at
page
30
of
the
supplemental
joint
appendix,
at
the
bottom
line,
bottom
of
the...
and
it
indicates
that
he
was
in
the
process
of
having
a
second
tenant
in
his
rental
property
and
that
he
was
beginning
a
job
at
about
the
time
the
petition--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--right.
mr.
david
g.
baker
no,
he
was...
he
was
not
employed
at
the
time.
if
you
look
at
his
page
18,
as
you
point
out,
it
says
at
the
bottom
the
income
given
is
estimated
based
on
a
new
job
which
is
about
to
start.
he
had...
he
had
been
the
principal
of
a
company
called
rlm
flooring,
which
had
been
closed
by
citizens
bank.
so
he
was,
in
fact,
unemployed
because
citizens
bank
had
taken
all
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation
and
shut
it
down.
and
this
put
him
of
course
behind
on
his
mortgage
so
he
was
very
concerned
about
finding
employment
so
he
could
in
fact,
keep...
get
his
mortgage
current
and
then
retain
his
home.
mr.
david
g.
baker
right.
and
between
the...
between
the
time
of
petition
at
the
meeting
of
creditors
which
was
approximately
six...
six
weeks
later,
he
became
employed.
as
i
say,
he
had
a
mortgage.
he
had
children
to
whom
he
has
to
pay
child
support.
at
the
time
he
had
a
wife
he
owed
a
lot
of
money
to.
he
was
concerned
about
having
employment
so
he
could
in
fact
meet
those
obligations.
mr.
david
g.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
g.
baker
the
bankruptcy
judge
should
examine
the
claims
that
have
been
filed,
if
any,
do
the
arithmetic,
offer
the
debtor
an
opportunity--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--he
should
deny
conversion.
mr.
david
g.
baker
he
should
deny
conversion.
if
in--
fact--
mr.
david
g.
baker
--it's
absolute
except
in
the
two
circumstances
stated
in
the
statute.
one
of
which,
is
as
your
honor
is
pointing
out,
the
eligibility,
the
other
is
that
if
it
has
been
previously
converted
he
does
not
have
that
right.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
g.
baker
thank
you.
mr.
david
g.
baker
thank
you,
your
honor
and
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
g.
baker
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
that,
having
been
counsel
to
a
chapter
13
trustee
many
years
ago,
i
can
assure
the
court
the
chapter
13
trustees
exercise
all
of
the
powers
and
authority
that
a
chapter
7
trustee
does,
with
the
exception,
as
was
said,
of
possession
of
property
of
the
estate.
the
property
of
the
estate
remains
vested,
however,
in
the
chapter
13
trustee
throughout
the
length
of
the
case.
it
does
not
revest
in
the
debtor
until
the
case
is
either
dismissed,
a
discharge
is
issued,
and
the
case
is
closed.
so
the
concerns
about
leaving
a
debtor
to
do
anything
it
wants
to
with
property
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
simply
is
not
a
reality,
and
i
think
it
does
a
disservice
to
the
many
fine
chapter
13
trustees
that
there
are
around
the
country.
mr.
david

no,
it
does
not
remain
in
her
possession.
the
chapter
13
trustee
technically
never
has
possession.
the
title
remains
vested
in
the
chapter
13
trustee.
mr.
david
g.
baker
it's
certainly
possible.
but
then
again,
there
are
statutory
and
rule-based
remedies
for
that
sort
of
activity.
and
our
position
is
that
those
rules
and
those
statutes
are
what
should
control
in
the
case.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
