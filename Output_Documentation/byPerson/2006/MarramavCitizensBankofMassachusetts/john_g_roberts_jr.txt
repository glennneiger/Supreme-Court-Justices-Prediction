chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
marrama
versus
citizens
bank
of
massachusetts.
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
baker,
as
i
understand
it
subsequent
to
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
your
client
filed
for
relief
under
chapter
13
and
that
relief
was
denied.
you're
now
seeking
under...
your
petition
seeks
a
conversion
to
chapter
13
and
i
guess
i
wonder
what
relief
is
still
open
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
relief
is
open
to
you
in
this
case?
in
other
words,
you're
trying
to
get
a
conversion
to
chapter
13.
subsequently,
you've
tried
to
apply
for
relief
under
chapter
13
and
that's
been
denied.
why
isn't
the
case
moot
in
the
sense
that
that
relief
is
not
available
to
you
now?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
cases
are
reconverted
to
chapter
7,
is
that
typically
done
before
or
after
the
filing
of
the
chapter
13
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
creditors...
under
chapter
13
one
of
the
prerequisites
to
approval
of
the
plan
is
that
the
creditors
get
at
least
as
much
as
they
would
have
gotten
under
chapter
7,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
presumably
the
creditors
might
want
to
see
what
the
chapter
13
plan
looks
like
themselves.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under...
you
think
105
is
an
affirmative
grant
of
power?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
105(a)
is
much
more
limited
than
that.
it
is
only
if
you
take
the
second
clause
of
that
out
of
context
and
quote
it,
as
has
been
done,
that
it
looks
like
an
affirmative
grant.
it
says:
"no
provision
of
this
title
providing
for
the
raising
of
an
issue
by
a
party
in
interest
shall
be
construed
to
preclude
the
court
from
taking
sua
sponte
other
action.
"
that's
a
much
more
limited,
narrow
provision
telling
you
not
to
imply
a
negative
pregnant
from
a
requirement
that
a
particular
party
raise
an
issue.
i...
as
a
source
of
sweeping
powers
to,
to
basically
act
as
a
roving
commission
in
equity,
i
think
that's
a
mis-citation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
about
the
different
structures,
wording
between
706(a)
and
706(b)?
i
mean,
this
provision
says
debtor
may.
the
other
provisions
say
that
a
debtor
may
ask
a
court
to
order,
and
it
suggests
a
difference
in
who
has
the
primary
responsibility,
whether
it
is
a
motion
of
the
court
or
whether
it
is
an
independent
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
under
those
other
provisions
the
court
doesn't
have
this
inherent
power
or
the
implicit
power
from
105(a)
that
you're
arguing
for
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you,
if
given
that
the
court
has
express
statutory
authority
to
reconvert
from
13
back
to
7,
why
should
we
take
the
leap
of
conferring
inherent
equitable
authority
to
do
something,
when
the
statute
addresses
it
in
a
much
more
specific
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe,
maybe
not.
i
mean,
they
convert.
he
comes
up
with
a
plan
under
13
that
looks
better
to
creditors.
i
mean,
just
because
there's
fraud
that
offends
the
court
and
prompts
it
to
take
action
prior
to
conversion
doesn't
mean
that
that's
going
to
be
the
same
situation
after
conversion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
it
might
injure
the
creditors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
limitations
would
you
recognize
on
this
inherent
authority
to
take
action?
where
do
they
come
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sense
it
makes
is
that
that's
what
the
statute
provides,
and
rather
than
relying
on
this
alleged
inherent
power
that
apparently
is
not
boundless,
and
that
the
bounds
of
which
will
have
to
be
articulated
in
case
after
case
after
case,
the
statute
provides
a
very
clear
mechanism
to
address
the
issue
of
fraud
which
allows
him
to
reconvert
it
back
to
chapter
7
promptly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
still
haven't
gotten
an
answer,
i
think,
on
what
the
prejudice
is.
who
is
prejudiced
by
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute?
the
conversion
takes
place.
the
judge
then
says,
because
of
this
fraud,
i'm
going
to
reconvert
it
to
chapter
7.
who
suffers
under
that?
you
say
sit
idly
by,
but
i
don't
see
the
long
passage
of
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
from
ms.
blatt
first.
mr.
baker:
i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
are
the
odds
that
that's
going
to
happen
if
you
have
a
judge
who's
exercised
enough
by
the
fraud
to
exercise
inherent
authority
to
deny
relief?
he's
not
going
to
let
it
languish
under
chapter
13.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
wouldn't
that
trustee
recommend
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
that
he
reconvert
it
to
chapter
7?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
right
to
convert
in
bad
faith.
if
it's
a
right,
it's
a
right
to
convert
despite
the
allegation
of
bad
faith.
it's
not
a
right
to
convert
in
bad
faith.
no
one
is
arguing
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
idea
that
the
debtor
can
come
in
and
say
under
13,
look,
whether
the
facts
bear
this
out
in
this
case
or
not,
i've
got
a
job
now.
i
can
pay
off
my
debtors...
my
creditors
according
to
this
plan,
and,
as
the
statute
requires,
the
creditors
get
more
under
13
than
under
under
7.
that's
a
benefit
to
everybody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he
says,
i'm
sorry
about
that
bad
faith
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
statute
didn't
provide
that
a
chapter
13
plan
could
be
reconverted
to
a
chapter
7,
would
the
court
have
the
inherent
equitable
authority
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
difference
in
language
under
706(a)
and
the
other
provisions?
706(a)
says
the
debtor
may.
the
other
provisions
call
for
action
by
the
court,
which
suggests
at
least
that
the
authority
to
convert
is
greater
under
706(a).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i've
been
assuming...
but
the
eligibility
under
chapter
13
even
under
the
present
case
is
a
present
day
question,
right?
in
other
words,
we
don't
go
back
and
see
if
he
was
eligible
for
chapter
13
when
the
conversion
was
denied?
the
question
would
be
whether
he's
eligible
now?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
now,
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
you
have--
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
baker.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
in
05-996,
marrama
v.
citizens
bank
of
massachusetts.
