justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
your
claim
doesn't
rest
on
a
due
process
denial
of
hearing
does
it?
that's
not,
that's
not
the
question
you
brought
to
us.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
not
answered
by
saying,
well,
he'd
get
a
hearing
in
that
case.
the
fact
remains
that
in
that
case
the,
as
i
understand
it,
the
judge
in
chapter
13
could
immediately
deconvert
to
chapter
7,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
due
process
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
fact
is
the
bankruptcy
court
could
deconvert
or
reconvert
to
chapter
7,
in
effect,
following
the
election
that
the
debtor
makes.
that's
so,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
would
we
have
a
system
as
ridiculous
as
to
preclude
the
court
from
looking
at
fraud
or
bad
faith
at
the
moment
of
election,
go
through
the
paperwork
and
the
folderol
of
converting
to
13,
and
immediately
turn
around,
admittedly
having
the
power,
to
deconvert?
that
would
be
a
rather
foolish
system.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
don't
have
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
deconversion
could
be
done
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
plan?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
case
as
i
understand
it,
your
case
does
not
turn
on
the
question
whether
there
was
or
was
not,
should
or
should
not
have
been
a
hearing
in
this
case,
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case;
is
that
correct?
