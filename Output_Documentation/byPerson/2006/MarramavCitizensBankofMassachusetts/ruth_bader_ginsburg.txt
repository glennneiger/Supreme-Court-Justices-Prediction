justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
isn't
eligible...
the
new
case
determined
that
he
was
not
eligible
because
his
debts
were
too
high.
he
didn't
incur
additional
debts
between
the
time
of
the
proceeding
one
and
proceeding
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
he
didn't
reduce
the
debt.
if
we
have
a
finding
from
the
bankruptcy
court
that
he
is
ineligible,
that
is
number
one
condition
to
convert
into
chapter
13.
if
you
don't
meet
that
condition,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
there
has
been
a
finding,
and
it's
an
essential
finding,
that
there
be
eligibility.
and
wouldn't
the
bankruptcy
court's
findings
in
the
later
case
have
preclusive
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
question
you
can
argue
on
appeal
in...
from
the
recent
decisions,
but
for
the
moment
you
have
a
bankruptcy
court
making
that
determination,
which
i
think
would
be
preclusive
on
another
bankruptcy
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
decision
is
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
first
circuit,
do
you
think
you
could
still
argue
that
there's
qualification
for
chapter
13,
after
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
a
determination
that
there
isn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
now
a
judgment
that
this
debtor
is
ineligible
for
chapter
13.
if
that
judgment
is
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
can
you
nonetheless
argue
that
somehow
there
is
no
preclusive
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
status
of
the
chapter
7
case?
i
was
under
the
impression
it
had
been
dismissed
and
a
determination
of
no
discharge
had
been
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
determination
that
you're
not
entitled
to
a
discharge?
that
has
been
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baker,
couldn't
the...
let's
say
the
conversion
goes
through.
the
first
thing
that
the
bankruptcy
court
does
in
the
chapter
7
converted
to
chapter
13
is
say:
i'm
going
to
dismiss
this
suit,
the...
the
bad
faith
taint
stays
with
the
case,
it
doesn't
get...
you
can't
erase
it;
and
so
back
you
go
to
the
chapter
7.
why
couldn't
the
bankruptcy
court
now
sitting
as
a
chapter
13
court
say:
we're
not
going
to
let
a
debtor
who
has
conducted
himself
in
bad
faith
proceed
in
this
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
convert,
right?
there
was
a
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
objection
to
the
character
of
that
hearing?
there
was
no
request
for
an
evidentiary
hearing?
so
there
was
a
hearing.
now,
does
that
get
wiped
out
too,
just
the
way,
the
determination
that
you
couldn't
convert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wouldn't
be
before
the
first
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
hardly
a
summary
disposition.
the
opinion
goes
on
for
pages
and
pages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
chapter
7
trustee
be
appointed
the
trustee
in
the
chapter
13,
the
same
trustee
who
has
now
been...
he's
terminated
because
the
chapter
7
has
been
converted.
could
the
court
in
the
chapter
13
format
appoint
the
same
trustee?
