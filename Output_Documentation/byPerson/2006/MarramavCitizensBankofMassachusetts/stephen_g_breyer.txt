justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
just
could
go
to
the
merits
for
a
second
here.
you're
saying
this
word,
where
it
says,
the
word
is
you
"may
convert",
and
that
means
you
can
convert
no
matter
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
what?
okay,
suppose
they
repeal
chapter
13
before
you
convert.
then
can
you
convert?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
producing
examples
where
it's
clear
you
can't
convert.
now,
suppose
congress...
there
is
no
chapter
13.
could
you
convert
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay.
suppose
he
dies.
could
you
convert
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
no
inheritance,
no
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
there's
no
such
person
existing
any
more.
he's
gone
and
his
whole
family
is
gone,
and
there's
no
inheritors,
nothing.
then
can
he
convert?
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
produce
ridiculous
examples.
maybe...
all
right,
so
you
say
even
if
he's
dead
and
there's
no
family
he
still
could
convert.
that's
an
extreme
test
of
my
hypothetical,
but
okay.
what
about
if,
in
fact,
he
goes
insane?
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
if,
in
fact,
the
conversion
is
part
of
a
scheme
to
defraud
millions
of
people
in
a
foreign
country
because
it
will
be
viewed
as
a
signal
that
they
should
mail
their
life
savings
into
a
particular
account
in
switzerland?
can
he
convert
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
yes
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
it's
going
to
bilk
people
out
of
millions
of
dollars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
what?
even
if
he's
dead,
even
if
he's
insane?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
alright,
then
i
can't
get
anywhere
with
my
hypotheticals.
[laughter]
i
would
have
thought
the
answer
was
no,
but
there
we
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
a
difference,
and
this
is...
assume
with
me,
which
apparently
you
don't
agree,
that
everywhere
in
law
there
are
implied
exceptions
for
unusual
circumstances.
i
have
never
found
an
instance
where
you
couldn't
think
of
some
exception
that
they
didn't
see.
you
could
not
bring
a
thing
if
you
were
insane
or
dead
or
if
a
death
would
ensue
or
a
murder.
assume
that,
all
right.
then
the
question
would
be,
well,
what
about
this
instance?
and
i
think
the
strongest
instance...
the
strongest
argument
for
saying
there's
is
no
exception
here
is
the
argument
that
the
trustee
discovers
that
this
individual
is
behaving
dishonestly,
that
he's
hidden
assets.
maybe
he
has
a
safe
deposit
box
and
he
has
a
key
and
the
key...
the
key
will
allow
him
to
get
diamonds
out
of
the
safe
deposit
box
and
hide
them.
under
7,
the
trustee
has
the
key.
as
soon
as
you
convert
it
to
13
the
key
is
given
back
to
the
debtor,
who
has
been
shown
dishonest.
now,
assuming
you're
going
to
have
some
exceptions,
why
isn't
that
a
very,
very
powerful
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
true
or
not
what
i
said,
because
i
don't
know
the
area,
that
if
in
fact
you
had
a
dishonest
debtor,
the
present...
the
proceeding
is
dismissed
on
7.
he
gets
the
papers
back.
the
papers
permit
him
access
to
a
hidden
source
of
resources,
and
he
steals
them
basically.
is
that
possible
or
is
that
fanciful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
it
possible
if
it's
in
13
that
then
the
debtor,
let's
say
a
dishonest
debtor,
could
get
back
pieces
of
paper
which
would
admit
that
debtor
to
the
possession
of
certain
property
which
he
could
then
take
and
hide
in
a
way
that
that
couldn't
happen
in
7?
is
that
possible
or
not
possible?
