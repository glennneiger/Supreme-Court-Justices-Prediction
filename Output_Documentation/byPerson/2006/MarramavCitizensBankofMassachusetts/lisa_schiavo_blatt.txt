ms.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
bankruptcy
court
has
the
inherent
authority
to
sanction
a
debtor
who
has
acted
in
bad
faith
by
denying
his
request
to
convert
a
chapter
7
case
to
chapter
13.
courts
have
the
inherent
authority
to
take
appropriate
action
to
prevent
an
abuse
of
process.
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
section
706
purports
to
impair
or
limit
the
bankruptcy
court's
power
to
police
the
integrity
of
its
own
proceedings.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
power
to
reconvert
under
section
1307(c)
is
in
this
case,
where
the
court
is
already
confronted
with
an
adjudicated
bad
faith
litigator,
it's
indirect,
it's
inefficient,
and
it's
inadequate
to
protect
the
bankruptcy
process.
the
potential
for
abuse
is
very
significant
if
the
case
languishes
in
chapter
13
for
any
period
of
time
because
the
bad
faith
debtor
gets
control
over
the
very
asset
he
fraudulently
sought
to
conceal.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
he
may
or
may
not.
bankruptcy
courts
have
thousands
of
cases,
and
if
there
is
an
absolute
automatic
right
to
convert,
a
court
with
thousands
of
cases
may
put
off
that
chapter
13
reconversion
to
another
day.
moreover,
there
may
be
individual
creditors
without
a
sufficient
stake
to
raise
the
issue,
and
the
chapter
7
trustee
who
typically
will
uncover
the
fraud
cannot
oppose
conversion
if
there's
a
right
to
convert
in
bad
faith,
and
the
chapter
13
trustee
or
the
united
states--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
the
chapter
7
trustee
is,
he's
terminated
on
conversion.
it
doesn't
raise
chapter
13
issues.
the
much
more
likely
scenario
is
the
chapter
7
trustee
will
tell
the
united
states
trustee
or
the
chapter
13
trustee,
but
they
may
or
may
not
learn
about
it
until
after
the
case
converts.
in
jurisdictions
where
there
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--an
order
to
disclose
the
asset?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
we're
talking
about
a
case
the
court
may
or
may
not
know
about
the
fraud,
and
the
trustee
may
or
may
not
tell
someone
in
time.
if
there's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
and
there
was
a
basis
to
oppose
conversion.
in
jurisdictions
where
there's
an
absolute
right,
and
bad
faith
is
not
a
grounds
for
the
conversion--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--we're
by
hypothesis
talking
about
an
absolute
right
to
convert,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
in
jurisdictions
where
there
is
an
absolute
right,
the
practice
of
bankruptcy
courts
is
not
to
simultaneously
convert.
it
does
happen
on
occasion,
but
the
more
likely
scenario
is
that
a
significant
period
of
time
passes.
but
the
other
point
is
that
if
there's
a
simultaneous
conversion
it's
a
completely
pointless
and
burdensome
process,
and
here's
why:
a
conversion
and
simultaneous
conversion
causes
the
termination
and
reappointment
of
the
chapter
7
trustee,
the
appointment
and
the
immediate
termination
of
the
chapter
13
trustee,
and
to
the
extent
there's
already
pending
chapter
7
proceedings
for
dismissal
or
denial
of
discharge,
the
conversion
would
appear
to
us
to
moot
those
proceedings
and
require
their
reinstatement.
and
this
is
a
completely
unnecessary
waste
of
everyone's
time
and
energy.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
in
the
majority
of
jurisdictions.
there
are
one
or
two
jurisdictions
where
there
are
different
judges,
but
the
vast
majority
it's
before
the
same
judge.
but
a...
if
a...
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
right
to
convert
in
bad
faith,
all
you
have
is
a
notice
of
conversion
and,
assuming
the
eligibility
is
met
and
it
hasn't
previously
converted,
a
court
may
say,
well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
think
that
our
point
is
that
the
absence
of
bad
faith
is
implicit
in
the
statute
because
there
is
this
background
rule.
when
a
litigant
comes
to
a
court
that's
already
abused
the
court's
process
or
seeks
relief
of
bad
faith,
it
is
a
core
element
of
a
court's
inherent
authority
to
simply
deny
relief.
you
can
toss
out
an
entire
complaint
when
a
litigant
seeks
it
in
bad
faith.
if
there
was
an
apparent
benefit
to
this,
go
to
13
first
or
deny
it,
the
united
states
trustee
wouldn't
be
here.
we
see
no
benefit
to
the
debtor
to
require
the
court
to
convert
and
then
reconvert.
all
it
is
is
an
unnecessary
waste
of
everyone's
time,
and
this
is
a
core
element
of
an
inherit
authority.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
here's
why.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
under--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--sure.
right.
and
there's
nothing
to
stop
a
debtor
who
truly
converts
and
has
found
religion
and
wants
to
come
clean
for
arguing:
let
me
convert,
it's
in
the
interest
of
everybody
if
i
do
convert.
this
is
a
discretionary
right
to
deny
relief.
the
court
is
free
to
allow
conversion.
but
under
the
plain
terms
of
section
1370(c),
the
court
has
the
power
to
dismiss
or
reconvert
a
case
to
chapter
7
without
waiting
for
a
plan
to
be
filed.
there's
no
requirement
that
the
court
has
to
sit
there
for
15
days
and
see
if
there's
a
plan.
a
chapter
7...
excuse
me--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--to
reconvert
to
chapter
7?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy.
it
might
be
because
you
can
have
an
involuntary
chapter
7
case.
but
on
this
point
about
a
court
sitting
in
chapter
13,
if
on
day
one
a
chapter
13
debtor
files
a
plan
in
bad
faith,
the
debtor
can
say:
please
wait,
i've
got
a
plan,
i'm
working
on
it,
give
me
a
couple
extra
weeks,
and
the
court
can
say:
no,
i
have
the
authority
to
throw
it
out.
and
what's
particularly
odd
about
this
proposal
is
that
in
2005
a
court
is
categorically
prohibited
from
allowing
a
chapter
13
debtor
to
proceed
under
chapter
13
if
the
petition
is
filed
in
bad
faith.
the
court
can't
confirm
a
plan.
so
congress
had
no
interest
in
protecting
bad
faith
debtors
after
2005
and
they
didn't
before
2005.
there's
no
policy
preference
in
the
code
for
bad
faith
debtors
or
allowing
a
debtor
either
proceeding
in
chapter
13
or
moving
from
chapter
7
to
chapter
13,
and
we
think
this
is
a
modest
exercise
of
a
court's
inherent
authority
simply
to
deny
relief
when
the
court
is
already
confronted
with
a
clear
case
of
abuse
while
the
case
is
in
chapter
7
or
the
debtor
has
otherwise
abused
the
bankruptcy
process.
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
section
706(a)
is
fairly
read
as
granting
a
statutory
right
to
convert
absent
the
two
statutory
exceptions
or
the
court's
proper
exercise
of
inherent
authority.
but
the
706(b)
and
(c)
just
explain
that
the
court
may
do
something
or
the
court
may
not,
or
the
court
shall
do
something.
so
we
think
our
position...
section
706(a)
isn't
even
addressed
to
the
court
at
all.
it
just
gives
the
debtor
the
right
to
convert,
and
it
doesn't
purport
to
limit
or
speak
to
the
situation
when
the
debtor
seeks
that
relief
in
bad
faith
or
has
otherwise
abused
the
bankruptcy
process.
and
i'd
just
like
to
end
by
saying
that
a
debtor's
bad
faith
concealment
of
assets
or
misrepresentation
of
financial
affairs
is
really
the
most
serious
abuse
you
can
have
in
a
chapter
7
case.
it
threatens
the
very
structural
foundation
of
the
code
and
its
integrity.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
our
position
is
that
it's
not
moot
because
it's
on
appeal.
if
that
decision
is
affirmed,
it
would
in
a
sense
practically
be
moot
because
there
would
be
an
alternative
grounds
and
the
debtor
wouldn't
be
eligible
under
chapter
13
in
any
event.
but
we
didn't
see
that
as
necessarily
an
article
iii
mootness
problem.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we
have
not
compared
the
two,
the
two
chapters...
well,
there
was
never
a
chapter
13
petition.
we
have
not
compared
the
chapter
7
petition
with
the...
after
this
case,
this
court
granted
certiorari,
then
the
chapter
13.
but
it
is
on
appeal
to
the
district
court,
so
it's
not
presently
moot.
we
would
ask
for
those
reasons
that
the
first
circuit's
decision
be
affirmed.
