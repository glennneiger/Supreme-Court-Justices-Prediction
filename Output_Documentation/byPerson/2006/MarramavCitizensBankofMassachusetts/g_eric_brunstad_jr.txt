mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bankruptcy
court
need
not
sit
idly
by
and
grant
a
motion
which
is
part
of
an
abusive
scheme.
the
power
of
the
court
is
there
to
deny
such
a
motion.
it
is
there
by
statute
under
section
105;
it
is
there
because
the
courts
have
always
had
power.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
the
second
sentence
of
105(a)
supports
the
traditional
powers
that
courts
have
had
to
grant
relief,
to
prevent
or
to
deny
relief
to
prevent
abuse
or
to
remedy
bad
faith
conduct.
the
fact
that
the
debtor
has
the
authorization
under
section
706
to
convert
a
case
cannot
be
construed
to
prevent
the
court
from
sua
sponte
taking
action
to
prevent
abuse--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
chief
justice
roberts,
i
think
that
in
order
to
understand
106(a),
the
second
sentence,
completely,
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
it
was
added
to
105
in
1986
in
response
to
a
number
of
decisions
that
were
holding
that
the
courts
did
not
have
the...
the
bankruptcy
courts
did
not
have
the
authority
to
sua
sponte
take
action
to
prevent
abuse,
to
monitor
their
own
calendars,
to
make
sure
that
inappropriate
things
weren't
happening,
and
that
senator
hatch
when
he
introduced
this
legislation
which
was
ultimately
enacted,
the
goal
was
to
overturn
cases
like
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
grissom
to
provide
expressly
and
perhaps
not
as
clearly
as
perhaps
they
intended,
to
give
the
courts
this
power.
but
i--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
part,
yes.
the
court
also--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
i
think...
i
think
105(a),
the
second
sentence
is
worded
the
way
that
it
is.
it
doesn't
say
exactly
that
the
courts
may
take
any
action
of
sua
sponte.
it
says
shall
not
be
construed;
the
fact
that
a
party
has
the
right
to
make
an
action
shall
not
be
construed
to
deny
the
court
the
right
sua
sponte
to
take
an
action.
but
i
think
that
the
implication
of
the
statute
is
clear.
there
is
this
background
principle
which
applies
not
only
in
bankruptcy
cases
but
in
trial
court
cases
in
the
district
courts
everywhere,
that
this
court
recognized
in
chambers,
that
it
has
specific
application
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
bankruptcy
in
pepper
versus
litton
and
other
cases,
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
may
take
action
to
prevent
abuse.
and
in
fact,
they
must
do
so.
because
by
granting
a
motion,
by
sitting
back
and
allowing
the
court
to
grant
relief
that
furthers
an
abusive
scheme
in
essence
makes
the
court
complicit
in
the
fraud
or
misdealing.
we
can't
have
that.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
drafting
conventions
between
the
two
subsections
is
key.
706(a)
says
the
debtor
may
convert.
whereas
other
sections
of
the
code,
like
1307(b),
other
provisions,
provide
that
upon
request
of
the
debtor,
the
court
shall
take
some
particular
action.
here
the
use
of
the
"may"...
i
think
the
word
"may"
properly
signals
discretion
in
the
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
section
1307(b),
upon
request
of
the
debtor
the
court
shall
dismiss
the
case,
that
is
an
absolute
right.
and
for
a
clear
reason.
nobody
can
force
a
debtor
to
continue
in
chapter
13
against
the
debtor's
will
because
chapter
13
requires
the
debtor
to
work
to
pay
off
creditors.
that
would
violate
the
13th
amendment.
so
there
would
be
no
circumstance
where
someone
could
block
a
debtor
from
getting
out
from
chapter
13,
for
constitutional
reasons.
that's
a
special
case.
that
is
why
congress
drafted
1307(b)
the
way
that
it
did.
contrast
that
with
section
706
where
the
court
said
the
debtor
may
convert.
now,
there
are,
there
are
requirements
that
the
debtor
has
to
comply
in
order
to
convert,
statutory,
but
there
is
also,
a
debtor
cannot
have
an
absolute
right
to
convert
if
it
would
be
part
of
an
abusive
scheme.
i
think
the
direct
analogy
is
this
court's
decision
in
pepper
versus
litton.
there
a
fraudulent
party
wanted
the
court
to
allow
a
claim
as
part
of
a
fraudulent
scheme,
and
this
court
unanimously
said
no
we're
not
going
to
allow
that,
even
though
there
was
a
subsequent
remedy
further
on
in
the
process.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
two
primary
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
reason
is
that
it
would
be
just
pointless
wheel
spinning.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
the
debtor
could
argue
in
the
context
of
the
motion
to
convert,
well,
i
would
like
to
propose
a
chapter
13
plan,
perhaps
the
misconduct
wasn't
that
severe,
and
the
court
can
take
that
into
consideration
allowing
the
debtor
to
proceed.
but
where
as
here
you
have
a
clear
case
of
abuse,
the
court
should
be
entitled
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
at
that
particular
point
in
time.
allowing
the
court
to
senselessly
say,
"oh,
go
ahead
and
convert--
"
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
the
court
can
take
that
into
account.
the
court
is
not...
is
not
shackled
under
section
706
to
deny
conversion,
it
can
consider
various
factors.
if
all
the
creditors
were
to
come
up
and
say:
"we
know
the
debtor
has
been
abusing
the
bankruptcy
system,
but
we
think
you
should
allow
the
conversion
to
a
chapter
13
case
because
perhaps
that
will
work
for
the
particular
circumstances.
"
but
whereas
here
there
was
no
such
thing,
the
creditors
were
saying
don't
allow
conversion,
this
is
part
of
an
abusive
scheme.
the
trustee
was
saying
don't
allow
conversion,
this
is
part
of
an
abusive
scheme,
the
bankruptcy
court...
if
the
court
had
signed
the
order,
then
that
affects
the
integrity
of
the
court.
is
the
court
itself
now
not
participating
by
allowing
it
to
happen,
this
sort
of
fraudulent
scheme?
the
court
should
be
able
to
nip
it
in
the
bud.
debtors
who
are--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well
i
think
that...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
they're
the
same
sorts
of
limitations
that
require
the
district
court,
when
it
is
considering
invocation
of
its
inherent
powers,
whether
to
exercise
them
or
not,
we
have
always
sort
of
recognized
a
special
situation
for
bad
faith
conduct
and
clearly
abusive
schemes.
where
those
occur
as
in
this
case,
the
bankruptcy
court
looks
at
the
circumstances,
holds
a
hearing
as
was
held
this
case,
considers
the
views
of
the
parties
who
are
involved,
and
then
decides.
now
it
is
a
relatively
high
bar.
you
know,
bad
faith...
it
is
a
continuum.
where
you
have
the
honest
but
unfortunate
debtor,
abides
by
all
the
rules,
clearly
no
bad
faith
implication
would
apply.
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
you
have
a
debtor
who
conceals
assets,
doesn't
disclose,
it's
found
out
in
bankruptcy
and
then
as
soon
as
the
trustee
finds
out
and
is
hot
on
the
debtor's
trail,
then
seeks
to
convert
to
get
out
from
bankruptcy,
well,
there
you
have
a
clear-cut
case
of
abuse
that
can't
be
tolerated.
now
i
think
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia.
i
think
candidly,
the
case
is
not
moot.
there
is
a
good
reason
why
we
do
not
allow
in
our
system
two
separate
bankruptcy
cases
to
be
pending
at
the
same
time.
once
a
first
bankruptcy
case
has
started,
the
court
jurisdiction
attaches
its
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
the
second
bankruptcy
case
that
was
filed
while
the
first
bankruptcy
case
was
still
pending
was
filed
without
jurisdiction
and
there
was
actually
no
jurisdiction,
because
of
the
prior
existing
case.
additionally,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
were
different
debt
levels
at
different
times.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
they
were,
but
for
the
first
case
there
was
debt
level
a.
about
three
years
later,
there
was
debt
level
b,
which
may
well
have
been
higher.
on
remand
if
the
debtor
were
to
succeed,
which
i
hope
the
court
does
not
allow
the
debtor
to
proceed,
or
succeed
here,
but
on
remand
if
it
were
determined
that
with
the
first
case
the
debt
levels
were
properly
below
the
limits
under
109(e),
then
the
debtor
would
be
eligible
to
convert
as
far
as
that
criteria
is
concerned.
we
do
not
know
absolutely
that
that
would
not
be
able
to
be
satisfied
in
the
existing
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
did
not
participate
in
the
second
case
and
make
that
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
that
it
was
primarily,
it
was,
the
debtor
was
litigating
and
we
did
not
make
the
jurisdictional
argument.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
particular
issue,
i
think
the
appeal
of
the
second
case
is
pending
before
the
district
court.
i
think
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
disposed
of
the
case
pretty
summarily
and
decided
that
while
this
particular
debtor,
just
looking
at
the
schedules,
does
not
have
the
eligibility
requirements
for
the
second
case,
and
therefore
dismissed
it.
that
does
not
necessarily
preclude
a
finding
upon
the
facts
in
the
first
case
which
is
still
pending,
that
it
could
be
converted.
i
think
candidly,
i
need
to
say
that.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
this
particular
bankruptcy
judge
obviously
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
particular
debtor,
having
presided
over
the
first
case
as
well,
justice
ginsburg.
so
i
think
the
bankruptcy
court
was
very
fully
apprised
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
case,
with
the
record
and
having
written
several
opinions
already
in
the
first
bankruptcy
case
which
was
still
pending.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
current
case
today,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens,
but
they're
not
tailored
to
this
particular
problem
or
abuse.
they
are
remedies,
for
example,
the
denial
of
the
discharge
for
concealing
assets
under
section
727.
but
that
won't--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there
might
be
criminal
sanctions
for
willful...
basically,
in
essence,
it's
sort
of
an
idea
of
theft,
you
know,
by
not
disclosing
assets,
but
it's
a
relatively
high
bar
for
criminality.
but
that
won't
protect
the
creditors
in
the
chapter
7
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
the
creditors
are
hurt
because
in
the
chapter
7
case,
once
the
bankruptcy
case
is
filed,
the
trustee
takes
possession
of
all
the
debtor's
property,
which
becomes
property
of
the
estate.
the
trustee's
role
is
to
liquidate
the
property
and
distribute
the
proceeds
to
creditors.
when
the
case
is
converted
to
chapter
13,
under
1306,
the
property
revests
in
the
debtor,
including
any
concealed
property.
at
that
point,
under
section
348,
upon
conversion,
the
chapter
7
trustee
is
disenfranchised.
his
services
terminate.
what
debtors
in
bankruptcy
who
are
perpetuating
this
kind
of
concealment
scheme
want
you
to
do
is
say
oh
no,
you
can
go
ahead
and
convert,
and
then
maybe
we'll
deal
with
it
later,
because
maybe
later
on
in
the
proceedings
something
will
happen.
the
chapter
13
trustee
might
not
be
apprised
of
it.
the
case
might
go
to
a
different
bankruptcy
judge.
in
some
jurisdictions,
the
chapter
13
docket
is
heard
by
an
entirely
separate
bankruptcy
judge.
they
would
like
to
get
the
benefit
of
delay
in
conversion,
because
perhaps
they
can
get
away
with
it
in
the
subsequent
chapter
13
case.
or
alternatively
in
the
chapter
13
case,
if
the
debtor
doesn't
file
a
plan,
then
the
chapter
13
trustee,
who
may
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
chapter
13
cases
he
or
she
is
responsible
for,
on
a
check
list
might
simply
check
off
no
plan
filed,
case
dismissed,
in
which
case
the
creditors
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
liquidation,
they
don't
get
the
benefit
of
the
assets
being
recovered,
they
don't
get
equality
of
distribution
under
the
chapter
7
scheme,
and
the
debtor's
fraud
is
in
essence
gotten
away
with.
so
that
is
why,
when
a
motion
to
convert
comes
up
and
the
bankruptcy
court
sees--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
not
necessarily.
the
debtor
could
move
to
another
jurisdiction.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
in
many
many
chapter
7
cases,
in
many
many
bankruptcy
cases,
you
have
creditors,
most
of
the
creditors
may
hold
claims
of
$500,
$1,000,
$3,000.
this
case
is
unique
because
there
happened
to
be
a
creditor,
citizens
bank,
who
was
owed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
who
had
an
interest
in
pursuing
the
case.
in
many
other
cases...
that's
why...
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
a
chapter
7
trustee,
to
represent
the
interest
of
myriad
small
claimants
who
collectively
have
no
individual
incentive
to
really
incur
all
the
costs
to
monitor
the
system.
by
converting
the
case
from
7
to
13,
disenfranchising
that
representative
of
all
the
creditors,
the
debtor
who
wants
to
play
the
game
of
concealing
the
assets,
and
catch
me
if
you
can,
can
in
essence
get
away
with
it.
this
bankruptcy
judge
understood
this.
this
bankruptcy
judge
denied
the
conversion
so
we
would
keep
the
case
in
chapter
7,
the
chapter
7
trustee
could
do
his
job,
collect
the
assets--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is
a
standing
chapter
13
trustee
in
chapter
13
cases
that
handles
all
the
chapter
13
cases,
unless
for
some
reason
that
chapter
13
trustee
must
recuse
him
or
herself.
under
section
348,
once
the
case
is
converted
from
7
to
13,
the
chapter
7
trustee
services
are
terminated.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
chapter
13
trustee--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia.
the
chapter
13
trustee
is
probably
characterized
mostly
an
administrative
person,
who
supervises
to
see
that
the
chapter
13
procedures
are
complied
with,
has
the
debtor
filed
the
chapter
13
plan.
if
not--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
practical
reality,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
what
the
chapter
13
trustee
does
is,
if
a
plan
is
not
filed,
moves
to
dismiss
the
case.
if
a
plan
is
filed,
may
look
at
the
plan.
if
the
plan
is
confirmed,
acts
as
the
disbursing
agent.
the
debtor
typically
makes
payments
under
the
plan
to
the
chapter
13
trustee.
the
chapter
13
trustee
then
makes
distributions
to
creditors.
and
on
chapter
13
day
in
many
jurisdictions,
one
day
a
week
or
every
other
week,
the
chapter
13
trustee
will
come
to
court
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
files.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
many
places
it
is,
your
honor,
and
they
have
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy
judge.
often
it's
assigned
to
the
most
junior
bankruptcy
judge
sitting
in
the
particular
jurisdiction.
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases,
the
chapter
13
trustee
has
neither
the
incentive
nor
the
resources
to
do
the
things
that
a
chapter
7
trustee
does
every
single
day.
and
not
only
that,
the
chapter
13
trustee
does
not
have
the
power
to
go
after
collecting
all
of
the
property
and
liquidating
it.
it's
denied
that
power
under
the
statutory
scheme.
so
it
makes
no
sense.
it's
pointless
to
say
we
must...
the
bankruptcy
judge
must
idly
sit
by,
grant
a
motion
that's
part
of
this
abusive
scheme,
allow
the
case
to
be
converted
to
chapter
13,
hold
another
hearing,
have
a
second
set
of
papers
perhaps,
only
to
send
the
case
back
to
chapter
7.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
link
case,
the
court
rejected
that
argument
in
construing
section
41(b),
where
the
court
said,
quote,
"neither
the
permissive
language
of
the
rule,
which
merely
authorizes
a
motion
by
the
defendant,
nor
its
policy
requires
us
to
conclude
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
rule
to
be
abrogate
the
power
of
courts
acting
on
their
own
initiative
to
clear
their
calendars
of
cases
that
have
remained
dormant
because
of
the
inaction
or
dilatoriness
of
the
parties
seeking
relief.
"
likewise
in
chambers,
i
think
the
same
principle
applied.
the
court
said,
we
don't
need
to
wait
and
deal
with
these
subsequently
occurring
procedures
to
remedy
the
problem.
we
should
do
it
now.
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the
clear
import
of
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
pepper
versus
litton.
there
was
a
remedy
of
equitable
subordination
for
the
fraudulent
claim
that
could
have
been
invoked
far
later
in
the
proceeding.
and
this
court
unanimously
said
no,
you
don't
have
to
wait
for
that
proceeding
later.
where
it's
clear
that
there
has
been
fraud,
the
creditor's
scheme
has
been
fraudulent,
a
fraudulent
claim,
the
court
can
act
at
the
time
of
allowance
of
the
claim
and
simply
deny
the
claim.
the
reason
for
it,
i
think,
is
the
reason
articulated
in
chambers.
the
integrity
of
the
court
itself
is
implicated
if
it
has
to
sit
back
idly
by
and
watch
the
abusive
process
unfold.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
the
creditors
suffer,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
they
suffer
because
there
are
additional
administrative
costs
that
are
incurred
that
compete
with
their
distributions.
we're
already
talking
about
dividing
up
an
inadequate
pie
to
satisfy
all
claims
in
full.
having
a
second
set
of
procedures
prejudices
the
creditors.
it
prejudices
the
court.
bankruptcy
judges
can
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
on
their
dockets.
to
have
to
have
a
second
set
of
procedures,
a
second
hearing,
it
burdens
the
court
unnecessarily.
and
again,
it
also
implicates,
again,
and
i
think
this
is
fundamental,
the
integrity
of
the
process.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
breyer,
that
is
certainly
possible,
and
i
think
that
is
why
congress
has
said
you
don't
have
an
absolute
right
as
a
debtor
under
section
707
to
dismiss
your
chapter
7
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
thank
you.
