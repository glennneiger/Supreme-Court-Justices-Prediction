ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
plaintiffs
who
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction
are
prevailing
parties
entitled
to
fees,
even
though
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
state's
nudity
ban
does
not
violate
the
constitution,
that
plaintiffs
were
not
entitled
to
any
permanent
relief,
and
that
final
judgment
should
be
entered
against
the
plaintiffs.
this
court's
cases
have
found
plaintiffs
to
be
prevailing
parties
in
only
two
situations,
when
they
win
judgment
on
the
merits
or
enter
into
a
consent
decree.
and
this
court
has
declined
to
confer
prevailing
party
status
based
on
interim
rulings
in
ongoing
litigation.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
no,
i
don't
think
there
is.
in
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
district
court
predicted
that
it
would
find
the
nudity
ban
significantly
infringed
free
expression
and
that
the
state
had
less
restrictive
alternatives.
that's
at
page
18a
and
19a.
in
the
summary
judgment
decision,
the
court
held
that
the
nudity
plan's
effect
on
free
impression
was
de
minimis
and
it
had,
that
the
state
had
no
less
restrictive
alternative.
so
in
both
instances
the
underlying
legal
claim
was
that
as
applied
to
nude
expression
the
nudity
ban
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
there's
a
factual
answer
to
that
and
a
legal
answer,
and
i'll
start
with
the
legal
answer,
which
is
that
the
preliminary
injunction
itself
states
that
it
is
assuming
content--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--and
as
a
legal
matter--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--i
think
we,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
have
to
disregard
those
statements
because
under
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
preliminary
injunction
itself
is
the
operative
document,
and
the
bases
that
it
states
for
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
are
the
bases
that
must
govern
both
on
judicial
review
of
the
injunction
and
as
a
matter
of
notice
to
the
parties
of
the
operative
effect
and
basis
for
the
injunction.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
and
that's
the
factual
part
of
my
response,
which
is
that
this
testimony
that
was
relied
on
which
we
quote
in
full
in
our
reply
brief,
was
testimony
by
the
state,
a
state
official
who
did
not
make
the
decision
so
was
not
actually
aware
of
why
the
decision
was
made,
and
was
testimony
only
to
the
effect
that
the
demonstration
envisioned
on
february
14th
might
be
different
than
her
previous
plays,
because
more
people
might
be
expected.
now
the
court
drew
from
that
telephonic
testimony
a
possibility
that
the
reason
for
the
state's
denial
on
february
14
was
the
content;
but
in
fact,
although
the
court
didn't
recognize
it,
it
also
had
before
it
a
decision
by
the
state
in
2000
denying
her
permission
to
put
on
her
play
based
on
its
decision
to
enforce
its
nudity
ban
against
her
at
that
time.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
she
wrote
a
letter
in
2000
requesting
permission
to
perform
her
play--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--under
the
same
terms
that
she
had
under
the
stipulated
settlement
from
1998.
the
state
denied
her
request
in
a
letter
indicating
that
the
nudity
ban
would
be
enforced
against
the
play.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
and...
and
i
guess
there's
in
addition
a
legal
elaboration
on
that
factual
record,
which
was
this
was
all
occurring
in
a
preliminary
injunction
hearing
that
took
place
24
hours
before
the
demonstration,
telephonic
testimony
of
an
ill-prepared
state
witness.
it
was
never
followed
up,
even
though
that
claim
remained
live
through
summary
judgment,
because
the
plaintiffs
continued
to
have
a
claim
against
an
individual
defendant
for
damages.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
the
challenge
continued
because
there
was
a
claim
for
individual
damages
from
the
park
manager.
so
in
order
to
determine
that
individual
claim
for
damages,
of
course,
the
plaintiffs
could
have
put
in
evidence
that,
in
fact,
rather
than
just
as
a
preliminary
prediction,
the
injunction
was
issued
to
prevent
content-based
discrimination.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
that
was
not
mooted
out.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
we...
the
purpose
of
the
attorney's
fees
provision
is
to
encourage
and
reward
meritorious
litigation.
and
at
the
point
at
which
you
only
have
a
preliminary
injunction,
no
matter
how
long
that
preliminary
injunction
has
been
in
effect,
what
you
have
is
a
prediction
of
success
on
the
merits,
a
balancing
of
equitable
factors
that
determine
interim
fairness,
but
you
do
not
have
a
decision
that
the
defendant
has
violated
the
constitution
or
any
federal
law.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
there
are
significant
consequences
to
a
finding
of
liability.
and
to
conferring
preliminary...
or
fees
for
preliminary
injunction
when
you
do
not
have
a
final
determination
of
violation
by
the
state,
you're
essentially
ordering
the
state
and
local
governments
who
have
not
been
judged
violators
of
law
or
had
a
full
or
fair
opportunity
to
defend
as
a
matter
of
law--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--and
but
the...
the
situation...
that
situation
will
also
obtain
if
you
confer
attorney's
fees
and
prevailing
party
status
on
a
plaintiff
who
only
has
a
preliminary
injunction.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
the
fact
that
a
plaintiff
gets
his
or
her
way
temporarily
based
on
a
preliminary
junction
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
has
violated
that
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights
or
that
that
would
be
the
resolution
of
the--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--to
prevail
you
must
prevail
on
a
legal
claim.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
respectfully,
that's
not
a
legal
claim.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
the
underlying
legal
claim
is
that
the
state's
denial
of
the
permit
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
that
is
a
type
of
relief
you
are
seeking
but
it's
based
on
an
underlying
legal
claim.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
it
is--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--it
is
a
product
of
an
equitable
balancing
that
determines
interim
fairness--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--i
think
this
court's
cases
have
interpreted
the
word
prevail
and
prevailing
parties
to
mean
you
must
prevail
on
the
merits
of
a
legal
claim.
the
only
instance
in
which
that
is
not
true
is
in
a
consent
decree
scenario
and
in
a
consent
decree
what
you
have
is
a
defendant
assuming
legal
responsibility
for
providing
relief
on
the
merits
that
resolves
a
claim.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
a
claim
that
is
never
resolved
cannot
be
the
basis
of
prevailing
party
status.
and
that's
what
your
hypothetical
poses.
and
i
also
think
it's
not
correct
to
say
there
is
no
point
in
continuing
with
litigation
in
that
setting.
in
a
private
attorney
general
setting,
there
is
a
value
to
having
at
the
end
of
litigation
a
decision--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--well
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
state
officials
decided
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
their
nudity
ban
to
the
end.
it
was
important
to
them.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
there
are
significant
countervailing
considerations,
and
one
is
that
under
the
rule
you're
proposing,
state
and
local
governments
would
be
fearful
about
enforcing
perfectly
valid
laws
in
emergency
situations
for
fear
of
being
penalized
with
fees.
then
they
have
no
fair
chance--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--i...
i
think
that
because
of
the
rule
i
distill
from
this
court's
case
which
is
that
you
can't
prevail
on
a
claim
that's
not
decided,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
what
the
middle
ground
would
be.
we
do
of
course
have
the
alternative
ground
for
decision
in
this
case
which
is
that
a
claim,
a
preliminary
injunction
that's
issued
in
ongoing
litigation
whose
prediction
on
the
merits
is
later
essentially
proven
to
be
false
by
subsequent
litigation,
can't
be
the
basis
for
prevailing
party--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--and
if
in
fact
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
issue
law
in
that
setting.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
then
you
just
articulated
why
that
plaintiff
should
not
be
considered
a
prevailing
party
without
taking
the
position
that
that
is
capable
of
repetition,
but
evading
review
situation,
arguing
that
in
effect
the
judgment
is
based
totally
on
law
and
converting
it
essentially
to
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
or
otherwise
coming
to
a
final
judgment
on
a
claim,
so
that
the
plaintiff
would
have--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--to...
to
impose
attorney's
fees
on
a
defendant,
it's
not
simply
about
what
the
plaintiff
gets,
whether
the
plaintiff
gets
what
he
wants,
but
it
is
also
about
what
the
justification
is
for
forcing
the
state
and
local
government
to
pay
fees.
and
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
to
impose
such
fees
against
violators
of
civil
rights
and
for
the
benefit
of
victims
of
civil
rights
violation,
and
not
simply
on
those
whom
it
is
predicted
will
have
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
i
don't
believe
the
student
has
prevailed
within
the
meaning
of
section
19(a).
the
student
has
been
predicted
to
be
likely
to
prevail
and
has
received
an
interim
fairness...
an
interim
adjustment
based
on
considerations
of
fairness.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
in
that
situation,
i
think
the
benefit
is
capable
of
repetition
for
debating
review
or
of
utilizing
the
class
action--
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
--but
there
are
tools
a
plaintiff
can
use
to
prevent
this
kind
of
case
from
becoming
moot
where
there
is
an
important
need
to
have
an
issue
decided.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
65(a)(3)
which
allows
consolidation
of
a
merits
determination.
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
i
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time?
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
and
there's
no
basis
for
awarding
fees
against
the
innocent
state
and
local
government
not
determined
to
have
committed
a
violation.
may
i
reserve
the
balance?
ms.
virginia
a.
seitz
the
plaintiffs
were
awarded
costs
incurred
on
the
preliminary
injunction.
my
client
was
awarded
a
right
to
costs
on
the
remainder
of
the
litigation.
those
costs
were
reduced
to
mirror
the
precise
costs
that
the
plaintiff
was
awarded
on
preliminary
injunction,
so
in
the
end
no
one
received
any
costs.
but
costs
were
allocated
for
plaintiffs
for
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
defendants
for
the
remainder
of
the
case.
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
about
the
timing.
the
time
prior
to
the
2003
demonstration,
in
2000
she
wrote
a
letter
requesting
the
right
to
protest
nude
and
received
a
denial
letter
in
response,
similar
to
the
one
she
received
in
2003.
so
she
was
on
notice
as
of
2000
that
we
were
enforcing
the
nudity
ban
against
her
activities.
second,
i
want
to
say
that
the
district
court
itself
characterized
its
holding
on
summary
judgment,
quote,
"as
plaintiffs
are
unable
to
show
actual
success
on
the
merits.
"
page
34a
of
the
appendix.
so
there's
no
doubt
that
what
even
the
court
understood
its
own
holding
to
be
was
that
the
prediction
in
the
preliminary
injunction
had
failed
to
materialize
when
the
court
considered
the
full
case
on
the
merits.
and
finally,
i
want
to
say
that
awarding
fees,
conferring
fees
for
a
plaintiff
for
obtaining
a
preliminary
injunction
essentially
requires
the
state
treasury
to
pay
its
opponents
when,
in
fact,
the
state
has
done
nothing
but
enforce
a
valid
law.
and
we
know
that
in
this
case
because
the
case
ended
up
getting
litigated
to
conclusion.
but
simply
because
we
don't
know
that
in
other
cases
involving
preliminary
injunctions
doesn't
mean
it
isn't
true,
and
that's
why
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
impose
fees
on
state
defendants
and
local
governments
that
haven't
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
defend
their
legal
position.
thank
you.
