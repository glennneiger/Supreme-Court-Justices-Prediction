justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
seitz,
i'd
be
curious
to
get
your
reaction
to
one
of
the
points
made
by
opposing
counsel,
which
is
that
there
were
really
sort
of
two
different
pieces
of
litigation
at
issue
here,
that
it
was
an
as-applied
challenge
that
produced
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
what
was
rejected
in
the
final
decision
was
a
facial
challenge.
is
there
anything
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
a
determination,
is
it,
that
they
have
a
right
to
hold
a
demonstration?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
just
a
determination
that
we
don't
know
at
this
point
enough
to
say
that
you
don't
have
a
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
what
if...
what
if
there's
nothing
else
he
can
do?
what...
what
horrible
does
he
face?
he
faces
a
horrible
of
having
to
pay
for
his
own
litigation,
just
like
the
rest
of
us
do.
i
mean
this
is
an
extraordinary
benefit
we're
talking
about
here,
getting...
getting
your
attorney's
fees
paid.
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we're
casting
this,
this
person
into
the
underworld.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
can
that
be,
that
a
preliminary
injunction
resolves
a
dispositive
question
of
law?
does
that
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
that
resolved
it,
it
was
the
appeal
to
this
court
where
we...
we
resolved
a
question
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is
you
wouldn't
mind
putting
that
on
a
resume,
that
you
have
been
subjected
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
black
mark
on
your
name,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
violated
any
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
voluntary,
these
settlements,
aren't
they?
so
you
could
at
least
say
that
the
innocent
person
who
gets
stuck
with
attorney's
fees
for
settling
gets
what
he
asked
for,
right?
it's
voluntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
got
a
tro
instead
of
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
aren't.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
two?
i
mean,
they
prevailed.
they
have
a
tro
here,
something
of
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
just
prevails.
if
you
think
tro
wouldn't
qualify.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
you
lost
on
the
preliminary
injunction?
the
fees
that
you
reasonably
expended
in
seeking
a
preliminary
injunction,
even
though
you
lost,
you'd
be
able
to
charge
to
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
i
think
you
can
answer
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
how
much
of
it
related
to
the
preliminary...
you
mean
anything
that
related
only
to
the
preliminary
injunction
you
would
be
denied?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
if
the
decision
on
what?
on
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
repudiated
by
the
district...
how
is
it
repudiated?
what
do
you
envision?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
later
case,
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
hypothetical
was
different,
was,
the
case
proceeds
to
final
judgment
on
the
merits;
and
at
that
point...
okay...
at
that
point,
the
issue
of
whether
the
preliminary
injunction
was
valid
or
not
comes
up,
not
in
the
direct
appeal
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
you
win
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
included
a
screen.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
people
didn't
want
a
screen.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
didn't
get
what
they
asked
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
only
because,
i
guess
the
other
side
didn't
take
the
action
that
they
could
have
taken
if
they
didn't...
if
they
didn't
apply
the
screen.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
conduct
the
demonstration
with
a
screen
or
without
a
screen?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
conduct
the
demonstration
with
or
without
a
screen?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
since
they
didn't
use
the
screen,
the
state
was
not
prohibited
from
arresting
them;
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
did
not
get
what
they
asked
for.
mainly
a
prohibition
against
the
state
interfering
with
the
kind
of
demonstration
they
wanted,
which
was
one
without
a
screen.
you
say
they
didn't
get
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
had
no
problem
with
that.
in
the
past
the
state
had
let
them
do
that,
as
long
as
they
had
the
screen.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
see,
it's
so
extraordinary
for
somebody
to
make
the
other
side
pay
for
his
attorney.
we
don't
even
do
that...
we
don't
even
do
that
for
guilty
people
when
they...
when
the
other
side
wins.
so
they
have
violated
the
law.
we
still
don't
make
them
pay
the
other
side's
attorney's
fees.
now
you
want
us
to
pay
your
client's
attorney's
fees
even
though
you're
not
dealing
with
a
guilty
party,
because
ultimately
the
court
found
no,
there
really,
this
person
didn't
violate
the
law.
that
is...
you
know,
that's
double
indemnity.
i
mean,
it's
multiplying
the
extraordinary
departure
from
our
usual
practice,
which
is
that
each
side
pays
his
own.
it's
one
thing
to
say
well,
if
you're
a
bad
actor,
in
certain
circumstances,
civil
rights
cases,
we'll
make
you
pay
the
other
side.
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
if
you're...
if
you're
not
a
bad
actor
in
a
civil
rights
case
but
you're
unlucky
enough
to
get
hit
with
a
preliminary
injunction,
we'll
make
you
pay
for
the
other
side.
it
just
grates
that
that...
it
ain't
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
congress
doesn't
often
do
things
that
are
grossly
unfair.
and
if
there
are
various
interpretations,
one
of
which
is
not
grossly
unfair,
that's
the
one
we
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
surely
wouldn't
say
that
the
fact
that
the
other
side
never
shows
up
means
that
you
can't
get
your
attorney's
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
a
prevailing
party
whether
there's
an
adversary
on
the
other
side
or
not.
