justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
case
be
different
if
the
defendant
had
consented
to
the
entry
of
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
this
had
been,
if
they
had
entered
into
a
consent
decree
covering
just
the
one
event
on
the
front
burner,
that
would
have
been
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
consented
to
the
entry
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
why
wouldn't
that
be
equally
binding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
were
able
to
go
ahead
with
their
one
demonstration
that
precipitated
the
litigation,
and
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
it
the
same
way
if
they
had
a
consent
decree
instead
of
having
the
other
side
not
fight
very
vigorously
in
opposition
to
the
preliminary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
why
isn't
the
attorney...
if
there
were
a
consent
decree...
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
assume
the
district
court
thought
he
was
right
at
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
ruled
otherwise
at
the
permanent
junction.
but
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
reviews
the
fee
application,
thinks
he
was
wrong
both
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
whether
they
made
an
error
of
law
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
think
he
made
an
error
of
law,
what
should
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
there's
no
reverse.
it's
too
late.
they've
had
the
demonstration
so
it's
all
over.
but
in
reviewing
the
fee
application,
the
court
of
appeals
concludes
that
the
district
judge...
the
decision
rested
on
an
incorrect
premise
of
law
and
therefore,
he
did
make
an
error.
would
that
control
or
would
the
district
judge's
view
of
the
validity
of
his
own
decision
control?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
direct
appeal
on
the
fee
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
it
correct
that
an
underlying
principle
of
law
that
justified
your
claim
for
relief
and
your
actual
relief
was
that
there's
some
first
amendment
right
to
demonstrate
in
the
nude?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
support
in
our
cases
for
that
proposition,
if
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
just
a
question
of
what
we
require,
but
what
congress
intended
when
they
wrote
a
statute
authorizing
these
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
these
trump
the
literal
language
very
definitely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
in
this
very
case,
if
you
had
gotten
a
tro
instead
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
you'd
have
exactly
the
same
practical
situation.
