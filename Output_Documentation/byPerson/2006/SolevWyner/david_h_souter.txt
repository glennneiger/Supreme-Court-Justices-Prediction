justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
we
make
of
what
i
understand
was
the
court's
post
hoc
statement
that
what
was...
the
reason
for
issuing
the
temporary
injunction
was
the
perception
that
there
was
a
content
basis
at
work?
and
what
do
we
make
of
it
in
light
of
the
fact...
i
think
this
is
of
record;
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
what
do
we
make
of
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
i
believe
it
is
in
the
record
that
i
forget
the
appropriate
state
official
said,
well,
it's
true
we've
let
you
do
this
in
the
past,
but
this
is
political
or
this
looks
political,
which
suggests
that
there
was
a
content
basis
going
on?
what
do
we
make
of
the
court's
statement
and
the
record
statement
by
the
official
in
deciding
whether
there
really
was
in
effect
a
separate
kind
of
order
involved
in
the
preliminary
injunction
from
the
order
that
was
denied
at
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
know
that.
i
know
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that's
why
i
asked,
what
do
we
make
of
the
court's
statement
subsequently?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
so
when
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
content
basis
actually
was
the
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
now
the
2001
order
was
it...
was
it?
she
applied,
i
think
it
was
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
factual
answer
in
effect
is
there
isn't
enough
fact
to
support
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
but
when
you
got
to
the
summary
judgment
stage,
the
particular
peace
demonstration
performance
was...
was
behind
them.
so
they're,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
have
been
expected
to
be
reinjected
into
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
wasn't
moot
after
the
demonstration.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
the
argument
is
undercut,
as
you
yourself
say,
by
the
settlement
rule.
don't
we
have
the
settlement
rule
simply
because
we
want
to
promote
settlements?
we
don't
want
litigation
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
simply
because
somebody
wants
to
establish
a
right
to
attorney's
fees.
and
doesn't
that
same
reasoning
apply
here
when
there
is
a
preliminary
injunction
and
that's
all
the
person
wants.
by
the
same
reasoning
that
we
accept
a
settlement,
why
shouldn't
we
accept
a
preliminary
injunction
as
being
a
sufficient
determination
of
rights
to
justify
fees
because
we
don't
want
it
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
when
nobody
has
any
issue
of
substance
involved,
but
is
just
litigating
for
the
sake
of
establishing
a
right
to
fees
later?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
only
attorney's
fees
that
would
be
assessed
would
be
attorney's
fees
attributable
to
the
preliminary
injunction.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
have
been
found
subject
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
playing
field
is
no
longer
even.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
mean,
it
does
mean
that
somebody
with
a
burden
to
establish
an
entitlement
to
the
injunction
has
carried
the
burden.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
let's
not
have
it
in
the
settlement
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
tro
case,
characteristically
the
other
side
isn't
heard,
so
you
haven't
prevailed.
