justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who...
who...
where
does
it
say
you
have
to
have
done
that?
my
statute
here
says
in
any
action
to
enforce
a
provision
of
1983...
the
tro
or
whatever
was
such
an
action.
it
says
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
allow
the
prevailing
party
an
attorneys'
fee.
well,
did
they
prevail
or
not?
they
got
what
they
wanted.
and
it
was
such
an
action.
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
you
have
been
declared
horrible
or
wonderful
or
violator
or
not
a
violator.
it
says
did
they
get
what
they
want
in
the
action?
answer,
yes.
end
of
matter.
now
what's
wrong
with
reading
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
they
got
the
legal
claim.
the
legal
claim
is
we
want
to
have
our
demonstration
on
february
14;
we
have
a
right
to
do
it
and
therefore
issue
an
order.
you
said
no,
don't
issue
the
order,
because
they
don't.
and
therefore,
they
won.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
but
what
about
the
legal
claim
we
are
under
the
law
entitled
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
i
thought,
where
it
say
that
in
the
statute
that
you
have
to
have
that
particular
kind
of
a
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you
think,
when
this
was
enacted,
to
make
up
an
example
that
it
is
as
horrifying
as
i
can
think,
where
the
ku
klux
klan
was
riding
in
the
south,
and
a
group
of
civil
rights
demonstrators
wanted
to
make
certain
they
could
have
their
demonstration
outside
the
jail
and
they
go
to
the
judge
and
says
the
sheriff
is
involved
in
this,
the
whole
town
is;
we
want
an
injunction
tomorrow.
tomorrow.
right
now.
so...
and
we
don't
really
care
that
much
about
the
end
of
it,
but
we'll...
we'll
go
ahead
and
litigate
it
if
you
want.
now
they
get
their
injunction.
they
have
the
demonstration;
it's
over.
i
would
have
thought
if
there
was
a
situation
for
which
1983
was
written,
it's
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
there
is.
the
other
side
has
a
lot
of
arguments.
and
they
each
have
arguments.
there
are
plenty
of
issues
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
law
in
respect
to
this,
which
is
right
on
the
point
you're
arguing,
that
two
parties
have
this
kind
of
suit
and
the
government
party...
they
settle
it,
and
giving
everything
that
the
plaintiff
conceivably
wants,
but
at
the
end
they
say:
we
don't
admit
we
violated
the
law.
can
you
get
attorney's
fees
there
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
consent
decree,
but
no
admission
of
a
violation
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
it...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i
thought
that
if,
a,
he
goes
in,
he
gets
a
preliminary
injunction,
he
says
the
law
is
da,
da,
da,
the
judge
says
you're
right,
that's
what
it
is,
preliminary
injunction.
and
now
it's
continued
up
on
appeal,
the
appellate
court
says
you're
wrong
about
the
law.
you
got
it,
you
had
the
event,
but
you're
absolutely
wrong,
the
law
did
not
support
you.
i
thought
under
those
circumstances
you
were
not
prevailing
and
you
couldn't
get
it.
is
that
the
law
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
because
it
does
seem
to
me
wrong,
that
where
a
person
has
got
a
preliminary
injunction
and
it's
legally
unsupportable,
and
then
he
gets
the
fee
but
then
they
appeal
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
determines
it's
legally
unsupportable,
he
never
should
have
gotten
it,
i'd
be
surprised
if
there
is
a
case
that
awards
the
fee
in
those
circumstances,
but
maybe
there
is.
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
case
you
can
think
of
that
under
those
circumstances
let's
him
have
the
attorney's
fees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
would
be
surprised.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
thing
that
i
wonder
about
this
case
is,
are
you
the
prevailing
party?
and
the
reason
i
ask
that
is
because
when
i
look
through
the
record
it
seems
to
me
your
clients
are
very
interesting.
they
have
their
point
of
view.
and
their
point
of
view,
one
of
their
points
of
view
was
that
the
state
said
you
can
have
this
demonstration,
just
wear
a
skimpy
swimming
suit.
no.
well,
you
can
have
the
demonstration
maybe,
i'm
not
sure
of
this,
but
we're
going
to
put
up
a
cloth
so
other
people
who
don't
want
to
see
you
don't
have
to
see
you.
and
there
your
client
said,
we
won't
pay
any
attention
to
the
cloth.
at
least
we
didn't
in
the
past.
and
then
looking
at
that
i
thought,
well,
maybe
what
they
got
was,
they
got
a
preliminary
injunction
or
a
tro,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
but
it
didn't
stop
the
state
from
putting
up
the
cloth.
it
was
pretty
clear
the
state
would,
and
it
should
have
been
pretty
clear
that
they
were
going
to
ignore
it,
which
they
did.
and
why
is
this
any
different
than
having
won
an
injunction
to
say
okay,
you
can
demonstrate,
but
in
your
swimming
suit?
in
other
words,
they
didn't
want
this.
they
didn't
want
what
they
got.
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
before
you
leave
that,
i
wonder
if...
there's
one
other
thing
floating
around
in
my
mind.
i
might
as
well
bring
it
up.
the
word
is
prevailing,
and
if
i
go
with
you
on
the
ground
that
it's
flexible
and
can
apply
to
all
kinds
of
things,
at
least
you
have
to
really
be
prevailing,
is
there
a
good
faith
element
in
that?
that
is
to
say,
if
your
clients
when
they
went
in
to
get
this
order
and
they
got
it,
and
at
that
time
they
had
no
intention
of
following
what
they
had
to
do.
rather,
they
had
every
intention
of
going
out
and
tearing
down
the
curtain.
does
that
enter
into
the
determination
of
whether
they
are
really
a
prevailing
party
who
ought
to
get
their
attorney's
fees,
if
you're
bringing
the
ethical
element
into
it?
