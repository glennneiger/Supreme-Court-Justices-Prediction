justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
get
a
preliminary
injunction
and
then
at
the
permanent
injunction
stage
the
basis
for
the
preliminary
injunction
is
reversed.
let's
say
the
preliminary
injunction
here
was
based
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
was
content-based,
a
factual
decision,
and
at
the
permanent
injunction
stage
the
court
finds
that
it
was
not
content-based.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you've
got
five
hours
billed...
you
bill
for
five
hours
to
write
the
brief
that
you
submit
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
you
could
get
those
fees
later
if
you
won
at
the
permanent
injunction
stage,
could
you
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
that's
not
the
case,
but
the
plaintiff
after
getting
a
preliminary
injunction
just
voluntarily
dismisses
the
case?
do
they
still
get
costs
for
the
preliminary
injunction?
