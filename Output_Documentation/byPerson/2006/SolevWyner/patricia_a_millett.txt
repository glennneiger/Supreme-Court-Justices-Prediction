ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
liability
for
attorney's
fees
and
liability
for
violation
of
federal
law
go
hand
in
hand.
a
preliminary
injunction
does
not
determine
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
federal
law.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
won't
say
never
in
this
narrow
circumstance.
and
that
is
when,
when
a
preliminary
injunction
results
in
a
definitive
and
determinative
ruling
of
law
such
as
thornburgh
versus
obstetricians...
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists,
or
the
steel
mill
seizure
case
from
this
court.
it
came
up
on
a
preliminary
injunction
but
this
court
made
a
dispositive
and
controlling
ruling
of
constitutional
law.
and
assuming
that
that
declaration
is
then
followed
up
by
a
change
in
behavior
by
the
defendant
compelled
as
result
of
the
ruling,
that
would
be
enough.
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well
it
happened...
it
happened
in
this
court
and...
and...
and
there
were
dissenters.
but
there...
it
happened
in
this
court's
case
in
the
thornburgh
case.
it
came
up
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
this
court
determined
there
were
no
disputed
questions
of
fact
and
it
was
only
a
contest
of
law
what
the
court
said
is
that
when
they
have
done
that
we
can
make
dispositive
ruling
of
law.
but
i
think
that's
an
unusual
situation
and
what's
critical
is
that
when--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
court
resolved
a
question
of
law
on
the
merits.
the
debate
in
that
opinion
between
the
majority
and
the
dissents
was
that
the...
the
dissent
said
majority
should
only
decide
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
issue
the
preliminary
injunction.
and,
i
mean...
it,
it,
it
can
become
sort
of
the
same
thing
if
an
error
in
law
is
necessarily
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
when...
when
a
superior
court's
made
a
definitive--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
it's
a
consent
decree.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
that's
right.
this
court,
while
repeatedly
stating,
including
unanimously
just
two
years
ago,
that
the
central
justification
for
attorney's
fees
is
that
the
defendant
is
a
violator
of
federal
law,
has
found
that
it
will
also
permit
attorney's
fees
in
the
consent
decree
situation,
but
that's
because
there
you
have
a
defendant
who
is
not
fighting
and
continuing
to
resist
any
form
of
final
relief,
has
instead
agreed
to
provide
final
relief
that
runs
to
a
plaintiff,
in
favor
of
a
plaintiff,
and
that
advances
the
purpose
of
federal
law.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think,
i
think
that
in
reality
certainly
a
party
can
say,
i'm
not
entering
into
a
consent
decree
if
we're
not
going
to
resolve
attorney's
fees
now
or
if
we're
going
to
have
a
fight
over
them.
so
they
certainly
have
that
power
because
it's
largely
a
contract,
although
one
enforced
by
courts.
i'm
only
trying
to
be
candid
with
this
court's
precedent,
which
is
also
recognized
in
mayer
versus
gagne.
for
some
reason,
maybe
they
reserved
the
question
there
to
be
disputed
in
court
whether
you'd
be
responsible
for
attorney's
fees.
but
i
do
think
that's
much
more
of
a
side
show
because
that
can
all
be
dealt
with
through
the
contract
elements
of
the
consent
decree.
and
really
what
you're
talking
about
when
a
court
is
coercively
imposing
attorney's
fees
on
a
defendant
is
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
not
pay
those
unless
they
have
been
found
to
be
a
violator
of
federal
law
or
have
agreed
to
through
contract
to
deal
with
that
issue.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
have
three
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
parties
here.
the
defendant
has
a
right
not
to
be
assessed
attorney's
fees,
which
are
a
form
of
final
relief
not
interim
relief,
without
a
final
decision
that
they
violated
on
the
merits.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
right,
but
they
have
a
right
not
to
pay
anything
if
they
haven't
done
anything
wrong.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
haven't
been
found
to
be...
there
may
be
a
presumption
or
a
substantial
likelihood
they're
going
to
lose,
but
that
doesn't
always
come
out.
and
there's
not
even
always
a
substantial
likelihood--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
this
is
a
case
in
point.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
the
test
is
the
prevailing
party,
not
the
substantially
likely
to
prevail
party.
and
the
other
reason--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
again
settlements
can
be
dealt
with
through
the
settlement,
as
part
of
the
settlement
process.
but
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
that's
what
i
tried
to
explain
to
justice
breyer.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
don't
think
courts
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
want
to
tell
the
government
every
time
we
agree
not
to
oppose,
to
stay
the
removal
of
an
alien,
that
we
somehow
would
get
a
bill.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
a
consent
decree
is
a
final
resolution
of
a
claim
that
legally
obligates
the
defendant,
final
relief
that
runs
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
because
it
is
not
a
final
resolution.
preliminary
injunctions
are
important.
they're
of
value
to
the
parties.
but
there's
a
trade-off
in
getting
it.
the
reason
courts
can
give
them
is
they
aren't
committed
to
final
relief.
they
aren't
committed
to
final
obligation,
and
they
can
decide
when--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
defendant
who's
been
fully
vindicated
at
the
end
of
the
case
shouldn't
have
to
write
checks
to
two
attorneys
instead
of
just
their
own.
there's
a
fundamental
fairness
element
here.
but
also
on
the
judicial
economy--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
the
defendant's
in
the
control
of
the
fairness
issue
in
the
consent
decree
and
is
not
in
this
situation.
but
the
other
situation,
concern,
is
concern
about
judicial
economy.
and
there's
arguments
in
the
amicus
briefs
on
the
other
side
that
preliminary
injunctions
are
common.
but
remember,
this
is...
the
central
justification
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
private
attorney
general
who
doesn't
just
do
what
they
want
to
do,
but
either
resolves
the
issue
of
law
or
obtains
enduring
changes
in
defendant's
behavior
that
are
of
utility
to
the
community
at
large.
contrary
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
not
the
united
states
government's
experience
when
it's
been
involved
in
a
lot
of
voting
cases.
lots
of
them
get
fought
until
the
end,
and
this
court's
decision
in
brown
versus
choate
recognizes
these
are
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
now,
if
the
private
plaintiff
doesn't
want
to
do
the
work
of
a
private
attorney
general,
that's
their
choice.
no
one
says
you
have
to
stay.
it's
just,
if
you
want
attorney's
fees,
you
have
to
accept
a
preliminary
injunction
for
what
it
is.
it's
very
beneficial,
but
it
is
not
a
resolution
on
the
merits
that
obligates
the
defendant
to
provide
a
form
of
final
relief,
not
interim
relief,
to
you.
and
this
court
itself
has
expressed
significant
concerns
about
having
voting
cases
being
run
up
on
preliminary
injunctions
at
the
last
minute
and
the
impact
that
can
have
on
voting,
and
we
shouldn't
encourage
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
enduring
more
in...
not
in
the
transient
sense
of
preliminary
injunction.
obviously,
things
change
on
the
outside
world.
but
in
the
form
of
final
relief
and
permanent
relief,
and
that's
what
this
court's
cases
have
said
time
and
again.
not
only
must
the
defendant
be
a
violator
of
federal
law,
but
in
ferrari,
in
texas
teachers
versus
darwin,
in
hanrahan
and
hewitt,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
it
is
final,
a
resolution
of
a
dispute,
a
final
judgment,
the
settling
of
a
problem
that
makes
someone
a
prevailing
party.
and
"prevailing
party",
as
this
court
explained
in
buckhannon,
is
a
term
of
art.
as
we
say
on
pages
11
to
12
of
our
brief,
"that
term
of
art,
as
defined
in
the
relevant
dictionaries
at
the
time,
was
not
just
that
you
won
something,
but
that
you
won
at
the
end
of
the
suit.
"
and
that's
a
question
of
basic
fundamental
fairness
to
plaintiffs.
remember,
there's
going
to
be
countervailing
judicial
economy
concerns.
if
you
tell
governmental
entities
that
they're
going
to
have
to
take...
may
i
finish...
have
to
take
emergency
appeals
from
every
interlocutory
order
and
resist
stays
to
avoid
liability
for
attorney's
fees.
thank
you.
