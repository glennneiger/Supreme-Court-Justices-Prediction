chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
next
hear
case
06-531,
sole
versus
wyner.
ms.
seitz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me.
i
mean
in
many
of
these
cases
you
have
fairly
elaborate
proceedings
over
the
preliminary
injunction
and
the
event
takes
place.
i
would
not
want
to
get
to
a
situation
where
people
feel
the
need
to
artificially
keep
a
case
alive
simply
to
ensure
their
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees.
so
how
do
you
protect
against
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
of
mootness
where
there's...
you
know,
they'd
be
happy
to
pursue
the
claim
to
establish
that
they
prevail
on
a
permanent
junction
as
well
as
a
preliminary
one,
but
the
case
has
become
moot.
are
they
automatically
disentitled
to
attorneys'
fees
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
may
be
a
point
to
pursuing
it
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
one
that
the
locality
governments...
i
mean
if
you
ask
them
the
question,
would
you
rather
be
liable
for
attorney's
fees
where
you
lose
in
a
preliminary
injunction
but
then
the
case
becomes
moot,
or
would
you
rather
have
to
face
individual
officer
liability
to
prevent
the
case
from
becoming
moot?
or
would
you
rather
face
ongoing
litigation
to
prevent
the
case
from
becoming
moot
because
there's
too
much
invested
in
the
fees...
they
might
choose
the
former.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
plaintiffs
decided
to
challenge
it
to
the
end.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
if
they
know
they
might...
it
might
result
in
a
loss
of
attorneys
fees,
when
all
they
really
wanted
was
a
particular
demonstration,
others
might
pursue
it
differently.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we'll
hear
from
ms.
millett.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
on
the
all
or
nothing
team
this
morning?
[laughter]
is
it...
can
a
preliminary
injunction
never
be
the
basis
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
never
understood
why
that's
an
issue.
can't
the
parties...
it
seems
to
me
an
exception
that
isn't
consistent
with
the
theory.
why
can't
the
parties
just
agree
on
attorney's
fees
in
the
settlement
agreement
and
the
consent
decree
and
then
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
an
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett,
did
i
hear
your
legal
test
a
while
ago
is
an
enduring
change
in
the
defendant's
behavior?
is
that
your
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
now
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
galanter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
they
left
federal
court
having
lost
on
the
permanent
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
their
legal,
their
legal
claim
was
that
these
regulations
were
invalid
under
the
first
amendment.
and
they
lost
on
that
legal
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
succeeded
in
filing
their
complaint
as
well,
but
they
don't
get
attorney's
fees
for
that,
because
they
were
successful
at
the
filing
complaint
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
get
attorney's
fees
for
the
preliminary
injunction
work,
even
though
you
lost
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
the
work
you
did
to
show
irreparable
harm,
balance
of
the
equities,
not
on
the
merits,
you're
saying
that's
off
the
table?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
approach,
just
as
there
are
problems
from
the
judicial
economy
perspective
with
your
friend's
approach,
but
doesn't
your
approach
require
the
states
to
fight
tooth
and
nail
on
the
preliminary
injunction
because
they're
running
the
risk
if
they
lose
there,
they're
going
to
pay
fees
even
if
they
prevail
later?
as
opposed
to,
as
is
often
the
case,
they
might
say,
you
know,
we
consent
to
the
entry
of
the
preliminary
injunction
or
we
don't...
you
know,
we're
going
to
save
our
energy.
doesn't
it
require
them
to
fight
every
possible
stage,
including
appeal
and
so
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
he's
wrong.
what
often
happens
is
as
it
is
here,
he
say's
i've
got
24
hours,
i
don't
have
a
brief
from
the
other
side,
i
kind
of
make
the
best
guess
i
can.
and
then
later
on
after
an
adversary
presentation
and
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
issues
a
different
ruling.
as
here,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
i
was
wrong
on
my
24-hour
off-the-cuff
guess.
it's
just
that
i'm
better
informed.
is
that
repudiation
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
the
court
order
provide
for
a
screen?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
state
prevailed
to
some
extent
as
well.
they
prevailed
to
the
extent
of
getting
in
the
order
that
they
can
do
what
they
had
done,
which
is
erect
a
screen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they're
entitled
to
some...
i
mean,
if...
this
is
not
a
reciprocal
switching
thing,
but
i
mean,
it
does
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
are
the
prevailing
party
when
your
opponents
have
prevailed
to
a
significant
extent
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can't
go
into
court
with
the
objective
of
just
getting
preliminary
relief,
can
you?
i
mean,
you
have
to
have
an
underlying
claim
of
illegality
and,
that
seeks
permanent
relief,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
knowing
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--preliminary
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
february
14th,
but
your
client
sought
further
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
you
were
asked
this
question
and
your
answer
may
have
just
slipped
by
me.
why,
if
you
had
asked
for
a
tro,
why
would
you
not
be
entitled
to
fees
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
thought
you
prevailed
in
the
sense
that
you
secured
relief.
that's
how
you
articulated
it
up
to
this
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
did
make
a
point,
that
they
were
kind
of...
this
was
short
notice
and
they
were
doing
the
best
they
could
on
short
notice.
i
mean,
they
showed
up
but
only
sort
of.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
regulations
told
you
weren't
allowed
to
protest
nude.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
seitz,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-531,
sole
versus
wyner.
