justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
we
have
to
judge
all
preliminary
and
judgments
alike?
i
mean,
in
some
cases,
the
preliminary
injunction
is
the
thing.
for
example,
suppose
in
this
case,
the
demonstrators
had
said
yeah,
we
went
in
with
a...
with
a
broad
challenge
but
we
knew
all
we
wanted
was
that
peace
demonstration,
and
we
got
it;
so
we're...
that's
enough.
we're
not
going
to
fight
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
a
plaintiff
do
that
when
the
plaintiff's
position
is
we
got
precisely
what
we
wanted;
this
is
not
going
to
be...
this
is
a
one-time
only
demonstration.
we're
not
going
to
repeat
this.
why
force
litigation,
especially
when
we
can
say
in
this
case,
you
lost
on
the
merits?
the
judge
made
a
prediction.
turned
out
that...
that
that
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
get
a
case
that
involves
a
student.
and...
and
something
like
the
defunis
case.
the
student
is
admitted
to
the
law
school
event.
they
have
much
controversy
over
this
affirmative
action
program.
the
student
graduates.
and...
but
the
student
has
prevailed
up
until
that
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can't
fight
on
because
first,
the
student
had
gotten
everything
that
he
wanted
and
the
case
is
moot.
the
student
has
graduated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
if
you
had
a
class
action.
he
had
a
single
action,
and
he's
graduated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apart
from
the
class
action,
what...
what
else
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh.
yeah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
got
what
you
wanted?
you
got
to
put
on
the
show.
i
thought
that
at
the
end
of
the
line,
the
judge
said
your
first
amendment
rights
have
not
been
violated,
the
nudity
ordnance
can
be
enforced.
if
you
had
come
back
again,
say
the
next
week,
and
said,
we
want
to
do
another
peace
symbol,
after
the
court
has
ruled
on
the
permanent
injunction
and
you
lost,
you
certainly
couldn't
prevail
when
you're
coming
back
with
another
as-applied,
when
the
court
has
said
this
ordnance
is
good
and
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
this
court
said,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
you
wanted
to
put
on
a
demonstration
that
would
be
like
the
plays,
that
would
be
hidden
from
public
view
because
you
have
a
curtain
or
whatever
around
it.
and
then
the
judge
said,
oh
no,
that's
not
what
they
wanted,
they
didn't
want
it
to
be
hidden
from
you
view,
they
wanted
people
to
see
their
demonstration,
so
if
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
they
don't
have
any
first
amendment
protection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
stay
with
this
case
because
your
interest
is
in
getting
fees
in
this
case.
suppose
you
had
lost
the
preliminary
injunction
and
then
you
won
at
the
end
of
the
line.
certainly
you
would
be
prevailing
throughout,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
lost
on
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
parsing,
is
there
any
doubt
that
if
you
won
on
the
main,
in
the
main
bout,
that
you
would
get
your
fees
for
your
entire
representation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
that.
but
would
you
not
get...
would
the
judge
say
you
don't
get
a
penny
for
the
effort
you
made
to
achieve
the
preliminary
injunction
because
you
lost,
you
lost
it,
even
though
in
hindsight
i
could
see
that
that
was
the
wrong
decision,
you
should
have
had
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
obviously
related.
it's
the
same
thing.
i
need...
i
have
a
short
time
to
answer
the
preliminary
injunction.
the
judge
said:
you
haven't
shown
probability
of
success
on
the
merits,
or
denies
it.
you
win.
i
thought
that
there
wasn't
any
doubt
that
you
could
get
your
fees
for
the
successful
result
from
the
time
you
filed
the
complaint
until
the
final
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
can
you...
i
thought
what
he
said
was...
i
thought
they
wanted
a
demonstration
that
was
going
to
be
secure
from
public
view,
and
instead
i
understand
now
that's
not...
that
wasn't
what
they
wanted
from
the
start.
so
on
the
premise
on
which
i
was
operating,
i
was
right,
that
they
were
going
to
do
it
just
like
the
plays.
but
what
they
really
planned
to
do,
and
did
do,
i
was
wrong
because
those
facts
were
not
before
me.
had
those
facts
been
before
me,
they
would
have
lost
on
the
preliminary
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
also
a...
that
was
the
demonstration
or
the
show
arrangement
under
the...
was
it
the
brooklyn
bridge
or
the
williamsburg
bridge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
6
a.m.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
get
costs?
the
phrase
is
"attorney's
fees
as
part
of
costs.
"
so,
do
you
get
costs
for
up
to
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
split
the
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
defendant,
having
succeeded
in
being
the
winner
in
the
whole
case,
didn't
get
costs
for
the
whole
case;
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
were
entitled
to
costs
for
the
entire
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
attorney's
fees
under
the
statute
are
to
be
awarded
as
part
of
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you're
not
entitled
to
costs,
if
the
defendant
got
the
full
costs,
then
how
do
you
get
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
when
the
statute
puts
them
together?
because
attorney's
fees
are
part
of
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
was
one
that
the
state
got
all
of
its
costs
from
your
client?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
seitz,
would
you
clarify
that
point
about
costs?
did
your
client
have
to
pay
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
private
action
brought
under
42
u.s.c
section
1983
and
other
civil
rights
laws
congress
established
an
exception
to
the
american
rule
that
the
prevailing
litigant
is

from
the

that

federal
district
court
in
their
discretion
to
allow
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney’s
fee
as
part
of
the
cost.
this
case
presents
a
single
question.
there
is
a
plaintiff
who
gains
a
preliminary
injunction
after
an
abbreviated
hearing
but
is
denied
a
permanent
injunction
after
a
dispositive
ruling
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
the
defendant
qualify
as
a
prevailing
party
within
the
compass
of
section
1988(b).
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
she
does.
we
disagree
and
hold
that
the
party
who
ultimately
loses
on
the
merit
does
not
rank
as
a
prevailing
party
based
on
the
preliminary
ruling
that
turns
out
to
lack
staying
power.
plaintiff
respondant
wyner
notified
the
florida
department
of
environmental
protection
in
mid
january
2003
of
her
intention
to
create
on
valentine’s
day
within
macarthur
state
beach
park
an
antiwar
artwork
by
arranging
nude
individuals
to
form
a
peace
sign.
responding
on
february
6,
the
florida
department
informed
wyner
that
her
display
would
be
lawful
only
if
the
participants
complied
with
florida’s
“bathing
suit
rule”
which
requires
patrons
of
state
parks
to
wear,
at
a
minimum,
a
thong
and,
if
female,
a
bikini
top.
to
safeguard
the
peace
sign
display
and
future
nude
expressive
activities
against
police
interference,
wyner
commence
suit
two
days
before
the
planned
event.
invoking
the
first
amendments
protection
of
expressive
conduct,
wyner
requested
injunctive
relief
first
and
immediately
a
preliminary
injunction
against
interference
that
the
peace
sign
display
and
second
a
permanent
injunction
barring
interference
with
the
similar
activities
in
the
future.
she
attached
to
her
complaint
a
1995
settlement
agreement
in
which
the
florida
department
committed
wyner
to
stage
a
play
with
nude
performers
at
macarthur
beach
the
next
year
in
1996.
provided
the
area
was
screened
off
to
shield
beachgoers
from
the
nudity.
the
district
court
granted
wyner
a
preliminary
injunction
on
valentine’s
eve
saying
the
choice
was
not
either
or
a
curtain
or
a
screen
behind
which
the
peace
symbol
would
be
formed
could
satisfy
the
interest
of
both
florida
and
the
nude
protesters.
the
display
that
took
place
the
next
day
,however,
was
set
up
outside
the
barrier
and
once
disassembled
from
the
peace
symbol
formation
participants
in
the
event
went
in
to
the
water
in
the
nude.
the
preliminary
injunction
was
good
for
one
day
only
so
wyner
pursued
her
demand
for
a
permanent
injunction.
she
informed
the
court
that
she
intended
to
put
on
another
valentine’s
day
production
at
macarthur
beach
in
2004
again
involving
nudity.
after
discovery,
both
sides
moved
for
summary
judgment,
at
the
hearing
on
the
cross
motions
wyner’s
counsel
acknowledged
that
the
participants
in
the
2003,
valentine’s
day
display
had
setup
in
front
of
the
barrier.
the
court
denied
wyner’s
motion
and
entered
final
judgment
in
favor
of
the
florida
officials.
the
deliberate
failure
of
wyner
and
her
“participants”
to
stay
behind
the
screen
during
the
2003
display
the
court
concluded
demonstrated
that
the
bathing
suit
rule
was
needed
to
protect
the
beach
going
public.
while
wyner
ultimately
lost
on
the
merits
the
court
added
she
had
obtained
a
preliminary
injunction
and
was
therefore
a
prevailing
party
to
that
extent.
observing
that
the
preliminary
injunction
could
not
be
reconsidered
because
it
has
expired,
the
district
court
awarded
wyner
counsel
fees
covering
the
first
phase
of
the
litigation
and
the
award
which
upheld
on
appeal.
we
see
the
matter
differently,
a
preliminary
injunction
holds
no
sway
once
follow
consideration
yields
rejection
of
the
legal
or
factual
basis
for
the
preliminary
order.
here
at
the
end
of
the
fray,
florida
prevails
in
the
suit,
the
state
bathing
suit
rule
remained
intact,
wyner
had
gained
no
enduring
change
in
the
legal
relationship
between
herself
and
the
state
defendants,
so
she
does
not
qualify
for
appeal
award.
questionnaire
notes,
we
take
no
position
in
this
case
on
the
extent
to
which
the
first
amendment
protects
artworks
that
involve
nudity
and
we
express
no
view
on
whether
in
the
absence
of
the
final
decision
on
the
merits
for
a
claim
for
permanent
injunctive
relief.
success
in
gaining
a
preliminary
injunction
may
sometimes
warrant
an
award
of
counsel
fees.
our
decision
hones
in
on
the
sole
question
presented
we
decide
simply
and
only
that
a
plaintiff
who
receives
a
transient
victory
at
the
threshold
of
an
action
can
gain
no
award
under
1988(b)
if
at
the
end
of
the
litigation
her
initial
success
is
undone
and
she
leaves
the
court
house
empty
handed.
the
court’s
opinion
is
unanimous.
