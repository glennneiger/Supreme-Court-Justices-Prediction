mr.
seth
m.
galanter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
went
into
federal
court
because
state
officials
told
them
their
protest
would
be
illegal
and
they
left
federal
court
with
a
preliminary
injunction
that
prohibited
state
interference
with
their
protest.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
your
honor,
20-some
months
later
they
lost
on
another
component
of
their
case,
where
they
were
seeking
permanent
relief
to
enjoin
the
facial
applicability
of
the
regulations.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
at
the
end
of
the
case,
your
honor,
yes.
but
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
one...
their
claim
for
relief
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
and
there
was
evidence
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
that--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--that's
true,
your
honor.
but
what
they
obtained
on
february
13,
2003,
was
the
relief
they
sought.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
we're
not
suggesting
that
tros--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
there
are
structural
differences
between
the
two.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
there
was
not
the
adversariness
that
exists
in
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
i
think
the
distinction--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--we're
not
suggesting
that
as
the
basic
rule.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
if
you
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction,
in
part
because
congress
recognized
the
difference
between
tros
and
preliminary
injunctions
and
placed
preliminary
injunctions
and
permanent
injunctions
together
as
the
kinds
of
orders
that
had--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--then
we
would
not
be
prevailing.
but
i
have
to
point
out
the
district
court
in
this
case
expressed--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that's
correct.
but
if
there
were
an
intervening
fact,
if
they
permitted
a
performance
of
"hair"
and
then
said,
but
we'll
enforce
the
nudity
prohibition
against
your
protest,
then
we
would
be
able
to
come
back.
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
does
not
preclude
future
as-applied
challenges,
either
content-based
or
arbitrary,
and
the
district
court
recognized
that
when
it
made
very
clear
that
it
did
not
reverse
or
repudiate
its
preliminary
injunction
ruling
simply
because
we
lost
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--that
is
what
was
at
the
end.
i
would
just
point
out
that
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
you
have
to
remember
ms.
wyner
had
been
permitted
to
put
on
her
play,
not
hiding
it,
several
years
before.
there
was
testimony
suggesting
that
one
of
the
differences
in
the
result,
the
refusal
to
allow
the
anti-war
protest,
was
because
it
was
an
anti-war
protest.
and
the
district
court
makes
it
clear,
in
our
brief
in
opposition
appendix
at
page
4a.
he
says:
"the
court
did
not
revisit
or
reverse
its
earlier
decision
regarding
the
same
legal
issue.
"
but
i
think
all
this
just
goes
to
the
point
for
that
this
case
presents
some
interesting
issues,
but
that
the
per
se
rule
that
the
petitioners
press,
that
you
can
never
get--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--we
would
obviously
be
a
prevailing
party.
but
under
hensley--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes.
under
hensley
versus
eckert,
this
court
has
made
clear
you
can
win
on
some
claims,
lose
in
others.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
we
would
get
attorney's
fees
for
the
reasonable
work
that
ended
up
leading
to
the
success.
district
courts
have
for
decades
now
parsed
through
these
legal
records,
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
there
is
doubt,
your
honor.
the
court
does
look
for
whether
these
fees
are
reasonable.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
your
honor,
under
hensley
you
look
to
see
whether
they're
related
or
unrelated
claims.
this
court
has
adopted--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--we
would
hope
a
court
would
find
that
an
as-applied
challenge
and
a
facial
challenge
were
sufficiently
related
that
we'd
be
entitled
to
fees
for
both.
but
what
i
have
to
stress--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--if
i
had
won
the
final--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
but
i
would
like
to
caution
that
that
would
be
eligible
for
fees,
but
the
court
would
go
through
it
and
say
how
much
of
this
were
related
to
your
final
win,
was
it
reasonable.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
it...
no,
your
honor,
because
those
very
things
are
also
needed
at
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
probably.
and
we
certainly
would
get
the
money
we
did
for
writing
the
complaint.
and
one
of
our
counts
for
the
complaint
here
was
exactly
for
the
preliminary
injunction
that
we
obtained.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
two
things,
your
honor.
as
i
think
i
made
clear
to
justice
alito,
if
the
decision
is
reversed
or
repudiated
by
the
district
court,
there
would
now...
we
would
not
be
prevailing
parties.
we
would
simply
have
gotten
this
benefit.
but--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
in
the
hypothetical
where
the
same
facts,
the
same
law,
and
the
district
court
says
i
was
wrong,
that
would
be
the
kind
of
repudiation.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
in
the
same
case,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
and
here,
in
fact
he
said
the
opposite.
he
said
i
wasn't
wrong,
these
were
based
on
different
legal
theories.
and--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
fairest
reading
of
the
district
court's
subsequent
orders
in
this
case.
what
the
district
court
made
clear
was
that
his
as-applied
holding,
that
the
plays
and
the
war
protests
were
being
treated
differently.
remember
that
it's--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
the
person
in
the
best
position
to
understand
what
the
district
court
was
doing--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes.
and
obviously
they
review
errors
of
law,
questions
of
law--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--if
he
had
made
an
error
of
law
in
the
preliminary
injunction
ruling
that,
on
de
novo
review,
and
reversed,
then--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--we
would
suggest
the
latter,
your
honor,
in
part
to
avoid
the
fees
on
fees
litigation
problems.
i
mean,
other
than
the
per
se
rule
of--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--no,
your
honor.
it's
not
wrong.
it's
consistent
with
the
text
and
the
policies
underlying--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--it
is
the
law,
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting,
though,
is
that--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes,
your
honor.
what
my...
if
i
may,
i
agree
with
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
that
if
you're
appealing
the
merits
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
something
which
shows
that
the...
the
preliminary
injunction
should
not
have
been
issued,
we're
not
a
prevailing
party.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
if
you're
appealing
from
the
preliminary
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals
reverses,
then
you're
not
the
prevailing
party.
but
justice
stevens,
what
i
would
suggest
to
you
and
to
justice
kennedy
was,
we
shouldn't
be
adjudicating
whether
the
preliminary
injunction
was
correctly
entered
at
the
fees
stage.
if
there
is--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
i
mean,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
different
standards.
i
can't
point
to
one--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
can't
point
to
one.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
but
the--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--they
did
get
what
they
wanted.
they
wanted
to
be
nude.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
they
weren't
escorted
off
the
beach
or
arrested.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.
they
had
an
order
that
protected
that.
now,
the
screen
was
there,
and
there's
material
disputes
of
fact
about
what
they
were
told
about
the
screen
by
whom.
but
the
court's
order
did
not
say
stay
behind
the
screen.
they
were
not
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
but
i
think
this
goes
to
the
more
general
point,
how
can
you
tell
when
someone
prevails,
and
this
court
has
already
established
that.
you
obtain
some
relief
through
a
court
award
that
materially
changes
the
relationship.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
the
court
order
that...
no.
the
court
order
said
that
the
state
was
not
prohibited
from
using
the
means
it
had
in
the
past.
so
it
clarified
what
the
state
was
not
prohibited
from
doing.
it
did
not
impose
any
requirement
on
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
it
did,
your
honor,
but
it
didn't
order
the
screen.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
they
didn't
get
removed
from
the
beach
or
arrested
for
being
nude
either,
your
honor,
so
they
did
get
what
they
wanted.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
your
honor,
when
you
obtain
the
court
award,
just
as
if
you
obtain
a
court
award
to
get
on
a
ballot
or
to
hold
a
parade,
or
to
wear
a
tee
shirt,
i
mean,
you
get
that--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
they
did
not
use
the
screen.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
they
didn't
get
that,
but
they
got
something
more
than
they
had
when
they
went
in,
which
was,
they
got
the
right
to
be
naked
on
the
beach,
which
would
have
otherwise
subjected
them
to
arrest.
and,
i
mean--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--it
wouldn't
let
them
do
that
this
time
even
with
the
screen.
it
sent
them
a
letter
saying
you
may
not
appear
on
the
beach
nude.
and
i
mean,
obviously,
at
some
times
you
don't
get--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--they...
yes.
they
narrowed--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--with
respect,
even
if
we
had
sought
and
obtained
a
permanent
injunction
that
allowed
us
to
protest
but
not
behind
the
screen,
we'd
be
a
prevailing
party,
although
the
defendants
by
their
successful
advocacy
would
have
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
injunction.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
an
underlying
part
of
that.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
i
think
this
court's
cases
in
barnes,
the
nude
dancing
cases
suggest
that
expressive
activity
combined
with
nudity
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
judge
calabrese
in
the
second
circuit
wrote
an
extensive
opinion
in
a
case
called
tunic
versus
zapper,
where
he
surveys
this
court's
cases,
and
finds
that
occasionally
there
may
be
for
artistic
or
political
reasons
a
right
to
be
nude
as
part
of
more
expressive
conduct.
but
i'd
like
to
maybe--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--it
was
on
the
streets
of
new
york,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
your
honor.
but
to
take
this
back
just
one
step,
to
the
notion
that
we
either
not
need
something
that's
sort
of
enduring
or
merits
based
in
order
to
obtain
relief.
maher
versus
gagne
suggested,
a
court
doesn't
need
to
resolve
the
merits
in
order
for
a
party
to
be
prevailing.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
speaking
of
the
language,
we
have
here
when
congress
enacted
1970...
1998...
in
1976,
just
two
years
before
this
court
had
interpreted
another
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
statute.
in
that
one,
however,
congress
had
actually
required
a
final
order
before
attorney's
fees
would
be
awarded.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
think,
your
honor,
that...
well,
first
of
all,
the
preliminary
injunction
itself
was
an
equitable
remedy.
unclean
hands
could
have
gone
into
that
question,
and
yes,
in
determining
the
amount
of
fees,
again,
equity
can
be
considered.
the
good
faith
of
the
parties,
just
as
the
complete
bad
faith
of
a
plaintiff,
this
court
has
held,
permits
fees
to
be
awarded
for
the
defendants.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that's
true,
your
honor.
although
you
can
go
into
court
knowing
that--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--you're
only
going
to
be
getting--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--and
everyone
here...
excuse
me.
and
everyone
here
knew
that
absent
an
appeal,
this
was
the
final
word
on
the
february
14th--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes.
but
it
also
sought
it
as
a
discrete
claim
for
relief
in
the
complaint,
this
very
injunction.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
in
this
case
awarded
us
costs
and
also
awarded
the
other
side
costs.
and
that's
actually--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--he
found
we
were
both
prevailing
parties
in
the
case.
and
that's
also
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
hensley,
which
says
you
look
at
a
case
and
the
unrelated
claims;
you
can
find
that
the
plaintiffs
are
prevailing
parties
on
some,
the
defendants
are
prevailing
parties
on
others,
and
order
cross
awards
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
they
were
awarded...
they
sought
and
were
awarded
all
their
costs
for
the
entire
case,
or
they
sought
their
costs
for
the
entire
case.
it
was
reduced
by
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
equity.
but
they...
not
because...
not
parsing
it
out
among
various
parties
to
the
case.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that's
correct.
and
there
are
many
cases
where
both
parties
end
up
getting
awarded
costs.
hensley
was
one
that
suggested
it
was
possible.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
no.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
yes.
and
our
client
got
costs
from
the
state.
there
were
counter
awards...
cross
awards
of
cost,
which
is
not
unusual
in
civil
litigation
with
multiple
claims.
but
more
importantly,
i
think,
when
we
go
back
and
we
look
at
the
purposes,
not
only
do
we
have
the
language
here,
we
also
have
the
recognition,
i
think
as
i
was
mentioning
to
the
chief
justice,
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
situations
where
core
1983
rights,
core
constitutional
rights
are
at
stake
where
you
know
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
obtain
a
permanent
injunction.
you
may
even,
as
my
friends
on
the
other
side
say,
ask
that
the
two
be
consolidated.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
oh,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
and
i
think
that
that's
actually
something
that
should
be
encouraged.
in
this
case,
the
preliminary
injunction
was
relatively
cheap,
as
litigation
goes.
to
encourage
them
to
continue,
particularly
since
the
core
relief
they
sought
had
become
moot.
yes,
there
was
additional
relief
they
sought,
or
it
could,
in
a
hypothetical
could
seek.
but
absent
an
appeal,
that
part
of
the
case
is
over
and
there's
no
real
need
to
continue
to
litigate
it.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
we
think
that
congress's
distinction
as
far
as
putting
preliminary
injunctions
and
permanent
injunctions
in
one
category
and
tros
in
another
for
purposes
of
appealability,
reflect
kind
of
a
congressional
judgment
about
which
is...
which
mechanism
is
intended
to
alter
the
kind
of
substantial
rights.
and
absent
the
rights
to
appeal,
absent
the
adversariness,
the
heavier
focus
on
irreparable
injuries,
unlike
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
those
are
all
things
that
we
think
make
tros
generally
ineligible
to
affect
prevailing
party
status.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that
is
one
way
to
view
it,
your
honor.
without
the
adversariness
at
the
hearing,
there
really
was
no
one
to
prevail
over.
whereas
here--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
this
court
has
certainly
described
some
relief
as
the
threshold
of
prevailing.
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
there
may
be
other
kinds
of
orders,
as
this
court
suggested
in
hanrahan
versus
hampden,
that
are
just
not
sufficiently...
they
don't
have
a
sufficient
change
in
the
legal
relationship
between
the
parties
to
warrant
prevailing
party
status,
even
though
they
do
benefit
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
tro
anticipates
that,
which
is
in
part
why
we're
not
suggesting
tros
are--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes,
your
honor,
but
we
were...
we
did
have
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
state
therefore
did
have
a
right
to
appeal,
and
a
lot
of
other
consequences
flow
from
the
fact
that
there--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--with
three
attorneys,
your
honor.
and
yes...
and
we
both
have
our
stories
about
why
there
was
short
notice.
ours
is
they
only
told
us
a
week
before
they
weren't
going
to
allow
her
to
protest
nude.
and
so
we
moved
as
quickly
as
we
could.
and
this
is
what
often
happens
in
election
cases,
demonstrations,
parades,
religious
exercise.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
your
honor,
those
same
regulations
had
been
in
effect
the
four
previous
times
she
had
protested
nude.
and
it
was
consistent
with
the
stipulation
they
had
entered
into
that
her
nudity
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
so
again,
she
was
certainly
entitled
to
negotiate
as
she
tried
to
do
with
the
state.
she
was
told
one
week
before
that
she
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
this.
she
went
to
court.
she
got
the
very
relief
that
she
sought
and
she
was
able
to
protest
in
the
nude.
now
in
the
other
cases,
you're
going
to
get
someone
who
just
finds
they
were
denied
the
right
to
register
or
to
get
on
the
ballot,
and
that's
going
to
be
disposed
of
immediately.
it
won't
be
capable
of
repetition
by
evading
review
because
the
person
is
now
registered,
the
election
is
now
over.
maybe
that
candidate
won't
run
again.
so
we
have
a
whole
core
of
first
amendment
cases
that
will
be
affected
if
petitioner's
per
se
rule
that
preliminary
injunction
is
never
enough
goes
into
play,
because
then
states
have
the
unfortunate
incentive
of
pushing
the
decisions
very
close
to
the
actual
event
deadline
so
that
even
if
they
lose
in
court,
they
won't
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
and
i
would
add
that
in
terms
of
the
broader
notion,
here
we
have
a
midlevel
state
official
sending
a
letter
to
an
individual
saying
we
don't
think
you
have
any
first
amendment
rights,
and
if
you
come,
you'll
be
violating
a
law
that's
subject
to
criminal
arrest,
if
you
come
and
you're
naked,
you're
going
to
be
subject
to
criminal
arrest.
absent
section
1998,
it
would
be
incredibly
difficult
for
persons
in
ms.
wyner's
situation
to
find
attorneys.
thank
you,
your
honor.
