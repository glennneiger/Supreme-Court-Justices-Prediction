but
in,
but
in
many
cases
the
case
will
become
moot
after
a
period
of
time
and
the
chief
justice
and
i
have
the
same
concern.
the
question
is
directed
to
do
we
just
keep
this
litigation
alive
for
the...
for
the
ancillary
issue
of
attorney's
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
asking
about
what
rule
you
propose
we
adopt
and
the
submission
to
you
is
that
if
we
have
a
rule
there
can
never
be
attorneys
fees
in
this
instance,
that
will
then
create
pressure
to
continue
the
litigation
when
it's
for
all
practical
purposes
of
no
real
importance
to
the
parties,
other
than
to
just
establish
attorney's
fees.
and
that
seems
a
waste
of
resources.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
are
saying
the
chief
justice
is
proposing
a
rule.
i
think
he
was
asking
you...
you
want
to
just
give
us
all
or
nothing.
and
we're
suggesting
that
it
just
doesn't
make
systemic
good
sense
to
insist
that
every
preliminary
injunction
be
carried
through
to
a
final
adjudication
for
attorney's
fees.
and
we
are
asking
is
there
some
midway
ground.
and
you,
you've
so
far...
you
can
structure
the
argument
the
way
you
want,
but
you
so
far
are...
in
effect
telling
me
absolutely
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
when
election
season
comes
many,
many
requests
for
injunctions,
and
after
the
election
is
over
the
case
just
goes
away.
nobody
is
interested.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
position,
all
of
these
matters
must
be
contested
until
final
judgment
before
attorney's
fees
are
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
to
avoid
fees
on
fees,
we
do
something
that's
wrong?
