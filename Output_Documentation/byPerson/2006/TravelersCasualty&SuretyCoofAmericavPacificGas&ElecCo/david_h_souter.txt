justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you're
one
step
ahead
of
that
here,
because
here
there
hasn't
been
any,
in
effect,
any
exposure.
here
there
isn't
any
certain
default
on
the
note.
so
far
as
we
know,
here,
there
may
never
be
any
default
on
the
workers
comp
obligation.
so
that
your
contingency
is
a
much
more
remote
contingency.
why
should
that,
why
should
this
case
fall
into
the
same
category
as
the
promissory
note?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
far
as
we
know,
it
won't.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
has,
but
that
depends
on
a
totally
circular
argument.
the
minute
it
filed
for
bankruptcy,
although
there
had
been
no
default
on
the
comp
obligation,
your
client
started
incurring
attorneys'
fees,
and
it
was
not
incurring
attorneys'
fees
based
on
any
default
by
the,
by
the
debtor.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
call
bankruptcy
a
default,
but
that's
not
what
i
mean,
and
you
know
that's
not
what
i
mean.
i'm
talking
about
a
default
on
the
workers
comp
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
has
been
no
default
on
the
workers
comp
obligation,
and
because
they
intend
to
keep
on
running
this
business,
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
there
will
not
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
maybe
you
don't
have
a
claim
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
i
mean,
that's
what
we're
getting
at.
we
can
understand
the
claim
when
the
note...
when
you've
got
a
promissory
note
and
you're
out
of
money.
the
claim
is
inevitable.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
inevitable
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
is
defined
as
broadly
as
this,
we're
in
a
situation
exactly
like
this.
there
has
been
no
default
on
the
obligation,
and
prior
to
getting
to
this
court,
$167,000
has
been
racked
up
in
legal
fees
that
accomplishes
absolutely
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
in
this
case,
$167,000
has
been
spent
to
come
to
the
conclusion,
as
i
understand
it.
that
if
the
time
comes
to
assert
a
right
of
indemnification,
you
can
assert
a
right
of
indemnification
and
we
can
oppose
it.
if
we
are
going
to
construe
the
bankruptcy
law
to
provide
a
law
like
this,
then
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
in
the,
in
the
construction
of
the
bankruptcy
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume,
let's
assume
that
one
of
the
recipients
of
comp
payments
had
come
forward
and
said:
i
object
to
the
plan,
i
have
a
claim
for
comp
payments
and
i
object
to
the
plan
because
it
doesn't
provide
for
them.
and
the...
the
court
said,
you're,
you're
right.
the
plan
is
going
to
include
provision
for
comp
payments
and
it
had
been
so
amended,
and
it
was
then...
the
plan
was
then
amended.
would
you,
under
those
circumstances,
have
had
any...
would
travelers,
under
those
circumstances,
have
had
any
reason
to
assert
a
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
know
it.
but
would
you
have
had
any
other
claim
that
you
would
have
asserted,
had
that
been
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
any
interest
of
travelers?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
had
been
done,
would
travelers
have
asserted
a
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
of
course
the
argument
here
is
that
this
is
something
different
from
the
general
abuse
that
you're
describing,
because
the
plan
didn't
make
any
provision
here
for,
for
paying
the
workers
comp
obligation
at
all.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
