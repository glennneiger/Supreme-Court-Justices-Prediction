justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now
this
case
comes
to
us
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
a
federal
bankruptcy
law
precludes
recovery
of
attorney’s
fees
authorized
by
contract
based
solely
on
the
fact
does
fees
were
incurred
litigating
issues
of
bankruptcy
law.
we
hope
but
it
does
not
and
therefore
vacate
and
remand.
respondent
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
(pg&e)
filed
for
chapter
11
bankruptcy
in
april,
2001.
petitioner
travelers
casualty
&
surety
company
of
america
which
previously
issued
a
surety
bond
to
guarantee
pg&e’s
payment
of
state
workers’
compensation
benefits
filed
the
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
to
protect
itself
against
the
possibility
of
default
by
pg&e
with
the
bankruptcy
courts
approval
pg&e
eventually
agreed
to
insert
language
into
its
reorganization
plan
and
disclosure
statement
to
protect
travelers
in
the
event
of
such
a
default.
additional
litigation
over
the
negotiated
language
nevertheless
ensued
and
result
ultimately
resolved
by
a
court-approved
stipulation
stating
among
other
things
that
travelers
could
assert
a
general
unsecured
claim
for
attorney’s
fees
incurred
during
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
as
authorized
by
the
party’s
original
indemnity
agreements.
travelers
then
field
an
amended
claim
seeking
attorney’s
fees.
pg&e
objected
to
that
claim
based
on
the
ninth
circuit’s
rule
originally
announced
in
that
courts
decision
and
in
in
re
fobian
that
attorney’s
fees
may
not
be
awarded
in
connection
with
the
litigation
of
issues
of
federal
bankruptcy
law.
the
bankruptcy
court
rejected
travelers
claim
based
on
the
fobian
rule
and
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
same
basis.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
lower
court
on
this
issue.
today
we
conclude
that
the
fobian
rule
is
unsound.
under
the
american
rule
the
prevailing
litigant
is
normally
not
entitled
to
collect
attorney’s
fees
from
the
loser
that
rule
can
however
be
overcome
by
statute.
it
can
also
be
overcome
by
contract
even
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
so
long
as
the
contract
is
in
enforceable
under
substantive
non-bankruptcy
law.
a
claim
for
fees
based
on
an
otherwise
enforceable
contract
is
allowable
in
bankruptcy
except
for
bankruptcy
law
provides
otherwise.
section
502(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
the
bankruptcy
court
“shall
allow”
a
creditors’
claim
“except
to
the
extent
that”
the
claim
implicates
any
of
the
nine
exceptions
enumerated
in
that
section.
none
of
those
exceptions
mandates
or
even
supports
the
denial
of
the
contract
based
claim
for
attorney’s
fees
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
issues
litigated
involved
issues
of
bankruptcy
law
nor
does
any
other
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
support
such
rule.
in
concluding
otherwise
the
court
of
appeals
relied
exclusively
on
its
own
precedent
most
notably
fobian
that
precedent
however
finds
no
support
in
and
affirmatively
conflicts
with
federal
bankruptcy
law.
pg&e
raises
several
arguments
suggesting
that
travelers
claim
might
fail
even
in
the
absences
of
fobian
rule.
but
because
those
arguments
are
not
fairly
included
within
the
question
before
us
we
will
not
address
that.
the
court’s
opinion
is
unanimous.
