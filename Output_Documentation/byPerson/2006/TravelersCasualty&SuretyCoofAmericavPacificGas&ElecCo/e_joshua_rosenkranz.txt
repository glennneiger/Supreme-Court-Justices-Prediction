mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
at
the
threshold,
on
whether
this
court
should
consider
the
statutory
construction
argument
that
we've
presented.
the
issue
of
statutory--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
fobian
rule
reaches
the
correct
conclusion
in
this
case,
but
your
honor
is
correct.
the
problem
with
the
fobian
rule
is
that
it
doesn't
go
far
enough
in
presenting,
in
preventing
creditors
from
requiring
other
creditors
to
pay
for
their
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
it
is
valid
as
far
as
it
covers
this
case
but
not
on
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
did
begin
in
the
wrong
place,
which
was
not
to
read
the
statute,
section
502,
which
is
why
that
is
a
rational
predicate
to
the
issue
that
travelers
is
presenting
here.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
fobian
rule
applies
to
oversecured
creditors.
everyone
acknowledges
that
section
506(b)
applies
to
oversecured
creditors
so.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
everyone
is
absolutely
clear
that
fobian
to
the
extent
that
it
applies--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
all
the
bankruptcy
practitioners
and
courts
are
clear
that
to
the
extent
that
fobian
applies,
it
applies
only
to
unsecured
creditors.
but
again
this
is
a
rational
predicate
to
this
court's
analysis
of
fobian.
how
do
we
know?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
i
apologize
for
focusing
only
on
the
issue
that
travelers
was
focusing
on,
which
was
whether
this
was,
whether
the
fobian
rule
was
itself
cert-worthy
question.
but
it
is
a
rational
predicate
because,
as
you
can
see
from
travelers'
brief,
travelers
says
no
fewer
than
a
dozen
times,
including
in
two
point
headings:
read
the
code;
read
the
code.
it
will
tell
you
that
unsecured
creditors
have
an
allowable
claim
for
post-petition
attorneys'
fees,
and
only
if
you
begin
by
reading
the
code
can
you
figure
out
whether
the
fobian
common
law
overlay
is
correct
or
not.
so
when
we
say,
your
honors,
yes,
let's
read
the
code,
that's
not
an
ambush
and
that
is
not
smuggling
in.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
we
do
have
court
of
appeals
decisions
on
this
precise
question,
not
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
fobian
and
the
rule
that
underlay
fobian
for
20
years.
but
there
are
three
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--we
do
not,
your
honor.
the
fobian
rule
is
wrong
at
least,
especially
as
to
the
distinction
that
it
draws
between
state
law
and
federal
litigation.
there's
only
one
answer
to
the
question--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
because
this
issue
has
been
fully
ventilated
among
the
lower
courts.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
futile
to
argue
this
before
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
said
that--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes.
now,
but,
your
honor,
let
me
just
add
two
additional
reasons
why
this
court
should
consider
it
now.
the
first
is
this
has
been
fully
ventilated
in
the
lower
courts.
there
is
not
a
single
argument
in
the
briefs
on
either
side
on
which
there
is
not
a
lower
court
opinion
going
one
way
or
another
on
every
argument.
secondly,
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
affirmative
harm
that
can
come
from
this
court
simply
saying,
let
us
conclude
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
disallowing
these
claims
on
the
logic
that
the
ninth
circuit
followed,
but
we
will
reserve
for
a
later
day
an
open
question
of
law
on
what
section
502(b)
and
506(b)
means.
and
the
harm
comes
from
the
fact
that
overwhelmingly
the
lower
courts
in
the
last
10
years
have
concluded
that
502(b)
and
506(b)
mean
that
unsecured
creditors
do
not
have
these
claims.
if
this
court
declares
that
it
is
now
an
open
question--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
we
would
dispute
the
contractual
interpretation,
but
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that's
one
logic
of
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
because
congress
didn't
say
that.
congress
gave
only
one
answer
to
the
question
whether
unsecured
creditors
get
their
attorneys'
fees
allowed,
that
is
post-petition
attorneys'
fees
allowed.
it's
either
yes
or
no.
there
is
no
on-off
switch
for
solvent
or
insolvent
creditors
within
the
code,
which
is
why
travelers
never
argued
that
as
a,
an
objection
to
the
plan
of
confirmation.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
absolutely
incorrect.
if
you
look
at
the
case
that
they
cite,
that
case
relies
on
a
provision
of
the
code,
which
is
section
726.
and
section
726
is
only
about
post-petition
interest
for
solvent
debtors,
not
post-petition
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
statement
that
travelers
quotes
from
collier
is
about
a
proposition
that
we
don't
dispute,
which
is
whether
it
is
a
pre-petition
claim.
but
collier.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
my
response
is
i
urge
you,
justice
breyer,
to
look
back
at
colliers,
because
that
is
absolutely
accurate
and
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
because,
your
honor,
that
is
a
statement
about
whether
it
is
a
pre-petition
claim,
not
about
whether
the
claim
is
allowable
or
not,
which
is
what
we
are
arguing
about.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
step
one
is,
is
it
a
claim.
no
one
disputes
that
this
is
a
claim.
it
is
a
right
to
payment.
step
two,
is
this
an
allowable
claim?
the
answer
under
the
code
is
absolutely
not,
because
the
code
says
there
is
only
one
class
of
creditors
that
gets
their
attorneys'
fees
claims
allowed
and
that
is
oversecured
creditors
and
so--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
congress
put
506(b)
in
the
code
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
and
that
was
to
allow
claims
that
are
not
elsewhere
allowed,
because
if
it
doesn't
do
that
506(b)
serves
no
purpose
at
all.
506(b)
says
nothing
at
all
about
whether
the
claim
is
secured.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
answer
is
506(b)
does
not
say
anything
about
whether
the
allowed
claim
is
secured
or
not.
it
is
completely
silent
about
that.
now,
if
we
accept,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief
in
much
more
detail,
if
we
accept
travelers'
argument
that
it
was
an
allowed
claim
in
the
first
instance
and
it
is
therefore
furthermore
an
allowed
security
claim,
506(a)
tells
you
what
to
do
with
that.
506(a)
tells
us
that
an
allowed
claim
to
a
secured
creditor
is
a
secured
claim.
it
still
leaves
section
506(b)
with
nothing
left
to
do.
now,
let
me
just
back
up
and
underscore:
any
creditor
would
love
to
get
the
other
creditors
to
pay
its
attorneys'
fees.
tort
claimants
would
love
it,
trade
creditors
would
love
it,
local
tax
collectors
would
love
it.
but
congress
said
only
one
category
of
claimants
get
to
claim
their
post-petition
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
congress
said--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
congress
has
said
no
such
thing.
what
congress
says
is
that
an
allowed
claim
is
allowed
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
that
is
when
you
value
the
claim
and
you
value
the
claim
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
at
that
point,
it
is
worth
zero
because
no
post-petition
attorneys'
fees
have
been
incurred.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
may
well
have
never
occurred
to
the
drafters
of
the
code
when--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
that
is
a
claim.
it
is
a--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i'm
saying...
they
are
saying
this
is
a
contingent
claim.
if...
and
it
is
a
very
strange
sort
of
a
contingency.
it
is
travelers
saying,
we
have
a
claim,
it
is
a
contingent
claim;
the
contingency
is
whether
tomorrow
morning
we're
going
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
called
weil
gotshal
to
monitor
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
but
let's
assume
it
is
a
contingent
claim.
it
is
still
a
disallowed
claim
and
congress
provided
numerous
statutory
indications
that
it
was.
i
already
mentioned
506(b)
but
there
are
more.
congress
said
that
attorneys'
fees
are
available
only,
quote,
"to
the
extent
that
a
claim
is
oversecured.
"
now
that
would
be
a
very--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
i
was
just
going
to
get
there.
timbers
underscores
this
proposition.
timbers
focused
on
the
structure
of
506
and
it
began
with
and
it
underscored,
the
only
words
that
it
underscored
were,
"to
the
extent
that".
but
let
me
turn
to
that.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
timbers
has
the
structural
argument
that
focuses
on
what
the
purpose
of
506(b)
is.
but
there
are
more
indications.
it
would
be
odd
for
congress,
for
example,
to
draft
this
provision
506(b)
that
purports
to
put
post-petition
attorneys'
fees
on
the
same
footing
at
post-petition
interest
if
it
intended
to
put
them
on
different
footings.
it's
an
observation
this
court
made
in
ron
pair.
moreover,
congress
was
not
oblivious
to
the
existence
of
attorneys'
fees
post-petition.
there
are
15
occasions
in
the
code
where
congress
spoke
to
attorneys'
fees
and
if
congress
had
intended
attorneys'
fees
to
be
available
to
this
enormous
class
of
unsecured
creditors,
one
would
think
that
it
would
not
have
hidden
that
in
the
definition
of
"claim"--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
as
to
creditors,
four
of
them
apply
to
attorneys'
fees
as
administrative
expenses.
it's
a
very
important
point
because
the
code
says
and
it
adopts
this
age
old
rule
that
if
you
are
going
to
take
money
away
from
some
unsecured
creditors
and
give
it
to
attorneys
it
better
be
because
you're
expanding
the
pot
for
all
of
the
other
creditors.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
for
the,
for
creditors
there
are
only
six
that
apply.
four
of
them
are
the
administrative.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
one
of
them
does.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
is
the
provision
that
travelers
cites...
and
i
apologize
it's
not
in
any
of
the
appendices...
502(b)(4).
and
502(b)(4)
underscores
our
point.
502(b)(4)
says,
and
i'm
quoting
directly
from
the
code:
"a
claim
is
allowed
to
the...
is
disallowed
to
the
extent
that.
"
and
then
"(4)
if
such
claim
is
for
services
of
an
insider
or
attorney
and
such
claim
exceeds
the
reasonable
value
of
such
services.
"
that
is
focused
on
pre-petition
activities
of
the
lawyers
on
behalf
of
the
debtor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
yes.
pre-petition
claims
for
services
provided
by
an
attorney
before
for
the
petition.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
an
attorney
for
the
debtor
and,
your
honor,
the
code
is
clear
it's
noteworthy.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
fair
enough
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
fair
enough,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
congress
knew
about
attorneys'
fees
and
if
it
wanted
this
huge
class
of
unsecured
creditors
to
collect
their
attorneys'
fees
for
post-petition
activities,
it
wouldn't
have
hidden
that
in
a
general
definition
of
claim
or
in
the
general
statement
of
allowability.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
first
circuit...
there
are
three
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
the
question,
all
in
dictum
but
in
very
extensive
dictum.
so
the
first
circuit
comes
out
our
way
in
adams
versus
zimmerman.
the
second
circuit
comes
out
also
in
dictum
on
travelers'
side
in
united
merchants.
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
splits
the
baby
in
half,
or
reads
the
code
all
the
way
up
to
our
position
as
we
do,
and
then
takes
a
detour
in
another
direction.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
we
didn't
come
here
asking
this
court
to
address
this
question.
travelers
put
it
front
and
center.
they
conceded--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
us
to
argue
that
fobian
was
wrong
when
we
were
trying
to
defend
the
judgment
below.
but
i
concede,
your
honor,
this
court
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
it's
going
to
address
what
we
believe
is
an
absolute
factual
predicate,
and
what
travelers
seems...
i'm
sorry,
legal
predicate...
and
what
travelers
seems
to
believe
is
a
legal
predicate,
which
is
why
we're
saying
to
the
court
this
case,
this
issue
has
been
ventilating
for
20
years,
and
a
lot
of
mischief
can
be--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that's
exactly--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that,
and
i
apologize
for
not
having
raised
it
in
the
cert
petition,
cert
opposition,
we
were
simply
focused
on
why
it
is
that
this
little
sliver
of
the
fobian
rule
was
not
worth
this
court's
attention.
but
i
understand
that
this
court
needs
to
look
forward
and
try
and
figure
out
what
exactly
the
issues
are
that
are
presented.
i
only
add
that
the
statutory
question
that
is
presented
in
deroche
and
in
this
case
are
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
mirror
images
of
each
other.
so
whatever
this
court
decides
as
to
the
statutory
construction
question
on
502(b),
this
court
can
say
it's
not
resolving
fobian
because
this
is
a
predicate
question.
and
this
court
can
say
there
may
well
be
circumstances
in
which
a
creditor
can
say,
you
know
what,
for
state
law
litigation
we
have
this
common
law
right,
and
we
reserve
for
a
later
day
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
exception
to
the
statutory
rule
that
we
are
articulating.
now
i
want
to
underscore
that
congress
had
very
important
reasons
that
are
built
into
the
code
for
coming
out
this
way
and
disallowing
unsecured
creditors
attorneys'
fees.
bear
in
mind
that
these
sorts
of
fee
shifting
provisions
are
absolutely
ubiquitous.
they
are
in
every
credit
card
contract.
they
are
in
every
bank
loan.
they
are
in
virtually
any
written
contract,
and
when
a
contract
doesn't
provide
for
it,
quite
often
state
law
statutes
do.
allowing
all
of
these
unsecured
creditors
to
pay
their
lawyers
out
of
the
hides
of
all
of
the
other
unsecured
creditors--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
if
the
rule
had
been
otherwise,
we
don't
know
whether
pg&e
would
have
been
solvent
at
all.
but
we
are
arguing
about
a
rule
that
is
not
one
rule
for
travelers
and
one
rule
for
everyone
else.
we
are
arguing
about
a
rule
for
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
the
answer
is,
congress
dealt
with
this
issue
and
decided
that
no
one
gets
to
get
in
line
and
get
their
attorneys'
fees,
regardless
of
whether
they're
solvent
or
not.
it's
a--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
no,
your
honor.
we've
been
talking
about
why
the
only
natural
way
to
read
the
code
is
to
disallow
attorneys'
fees,
and
i'm
explaining
that
if
attorneys'
fees
are
generally
disallowed
to
everyone,
there's
no
exception
to
that
rule
in
the
code
that
says
ah,
yes,
but
if
there's
an
insolvent...
if
there's
a
solvent
debtor,
the
rule
is
otherwise.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i'm
sorry.
what
i'm
saying
is
502(b)
when
you
read
"as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
"
it
says...
that
means,
that
must
mean
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
post-petition
attorneys'
fees,
especially
when
you
look
at
502(b)
through
the
lens,
as
this
court
did
in
timbers,
of
the
rest
of
the
code.
506(b),
all
of
these
other
attorneys'
fees--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
colliers,
but
i
don't
think
colliers
comes
out
one
way
or
another
on
this
particular
question.
that
was
the
same
question
that
was
asked
earlier
about
whether
it's
a
claim,
whether
it's
a
pre-petition
claim.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
was
the
same--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
was
referring
to
another
provision
of
colliers,
not
the
one
that's
cited
in
the
reply
brief.
that
is
a
correct
statement
but
it
has
no
application
here
because
we
are
not
arguing
about
whether
it's
a
pre-petition
obligation.
of
course
it's
a
pre-petition
obligation.
just
like
pre-petition
interest...
excuse
me...
post-petition
interest
is
a
pre-petition
obligation
we
are
arguing
that
the
code
cancels
that
obligation
because
there
are
very
important
reasons,
such
as
equality
among
all
unsecured
creditors,
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
what
colliers
is
talking
about
is
a
completely
different
question.
he
doesn't
answer
that
question
one
way
or
another
in
colliers.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
this
was
a
completely
different
discussion
on
a--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--completely
different
section
referring
to
setoffs.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
one
other
point
and
that
is,
502(c)
tells
the
court
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
with
contingent
claims.
it
is
supposed
to
either
liquidate
them
or
estimate
them.
these
are...
this
is
a
very
strange
sort
of
contingency,
as
i
mentioned
earlier.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
502(c)
is,
your
honor.
it's
on
the
very
back
of
the
cert
petition
appendix
on
page,
i
believe
28.
and
so
it
says
either
estimate
or
liquidate,
but
always
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
now
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
it
would
be
impossible
to
estimate
without
a
crystal
ball.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
what
you
do
is...
that
is
a
classic
contingency.
what
you
do
is
to
estimate
the
likelihood
that
the
bathroom
will
in
fact
leak
and
the
cost
of
those
expenses,
and
you
put
something
into
the,
into
the
bankruptcy
estate
for
that
purpose.
that
would
be
something
that
congress
would
never
have
wanted
to
do
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
why
a
surety
is
different
from
any
other
contract.
all
contractual
creditors
will
want
their
fees.
the
reason
that
they
haven't
been
applying
for
them
is
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
bankruptcy
courts
will
tell
you
no,
you
can't
have
them,
because
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
have
been
saying
exactly
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
502(b)
does
not
allow
them,
and
we
can
tell
that
by
looking
at
506(b).
and
there
are
other
reasons
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
do
that.
it
would
have
burdened
the
administration
of
the
state...
of
the
estate.
the
court
would
be
spending
more
time
administering
claims
about
fees
and
what
does
this
contract
mean,
and
fees
upon
fees
upon
fees,
than
it
would
be
spending
administering
the
basic
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
my
response
is
that
is
absolutely
wrong.
the
first
draft
of
the
plan
which
you
can
see
on
page
28
of
the
appendix
says
explicitly,
and
i
quote,
"all
workers
compensation
programs
are
treated
as
executory
contract.
"
treated
as
executory
contracts
and
deemed
assumed
by
the
debtor,
and
that
means
that
the
workers
got
the
most
favorable
treatment
that
they
could
have
gotten.
these
are
not
just
unsecured
claims.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
that's
what
they
argued.
the
bankruptcy
court
explicitly
held
otherwise
and
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
said,
none
of
your
interventions
were
reasonably
necessary
to
reach...
excuse
me...
to
advance
your
interests.
therefore,
you
are
absolutely
wrong
when
you
argue
to
us
that
you
are
on
the
state
law
side
of
the
fobian
rule.
now
if
you
ask
me,
your
honor,
where
in
the
bankruptcy
court
decision
does
it
say
that,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
24a
of
the...
of
the
cert
petition
appendix,
where
you
see
asterisks
for
a
missing
paragraph
right
in
the
middle
of
the
opinion.
that,
and
just
to
orient
the
court,
we're
looking
at
the
first
paragraph
that
says
first
of
all.
then
there's
a...
there
is
an
asterisk
eliminating
a
paragraph.
look
at
page
140a,
141
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
missing
paragraph
that
travelers
eliminated
is
filled
in,
and
there
the
court
summarizes
a
15-page
colloquy
with
travelers
about
why
it
is
completely
wrong
in
claiming
that
its
steps
were
reasonably
necessary.
and
on
page
141,
just
to
orient
the
court
again,
you
see
that
it
begins,
second
paragraph,
first
of
all.
that's
the
same
paragraph.
the
next
paragraph
refers
to
mr.
brunstad's
arguments.
it
says,
"i
just
simply
don't
by
it.
"
"i
don't
think
you
can
sort
of
say,
you
know,
we
thought
there
was
a
thief
hiding
under
the
bed
so
we
had
to
clear
out
under
the
bed.
"
"i
don't
think
there
was
a
risk
there.
"
and
that
was
the
gist
of
15
pages
proceeding
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
court
methodically
demolishes
each
of
the
argument
travelers
presents
here.
thank
you,
your
honor.
