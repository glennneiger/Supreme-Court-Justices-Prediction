justice
stephen
g.
breyer
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sort
of
back
where
justice
kennedy
started
on
this.
forget...
i'd
like
to
forget
your
case,
because
your
case
seems
to
me
to
be
a
case
where
parties
argue
reasonably
about
whether
the
contract
itself
covers
this
kind
of
fee.
and
maybe
it
doesn't,
if
it's
very
unreasonable,
et
cetera.
but
let's
take
a
very
straightforward
case.
it's
an
obvious
contract
to
collect
a
debt,
or
maybe
a
mortgage,
and
in
the
debt
or
the
mortgage
agreement,
it
says,
attorneys'
fees
will
be
paid
for
collection.
it
clearly
covers
bankruptcy,
too,
by
its
language.
and
now
there
must
be
many
instances
or
some,
anyway,
where
the
security
is
inadequate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
must
be
other
instances
in
which
there
wasn't
any
security.
and
if
i
read
collier
as
you
pointed
to,
that
seems
to
say,
in
such
cases,
very
simple,
the
creditor
has
the
status
of
an
unsecured
creditor
in
respect
to
those
attorneys'
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
overage
in
the
secured
case,
and
the
whole
claim
in
the
unsecured
case.
so
get
in
the
queue
and
you
can
collect
your
pro-rata
share.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is,
i
have
19
professors
on
the
other
side
coming
to
tell
me
that
that's
never
happened.
they
can't
even
find
an
instance.
so
it
isn't
as
if,
it
isn't
as
if
you
haven't
found
an
instance,
it
is
that
they
are
prepared
to
say
it
never
happened.
and
then
there
may
be
one
exception
or
two
or
something
like
that.
and
i
can't,
that...
i'm
now
totally
puzzled.
because
if
it's
so
clear
as
you
say,
and
i
follow
your
logic,
and
i
followed
collier,
why?
after
all,
there
are
bankrupt
people
who
do
have
some
assets.
explain
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
have
thought
that
the
one
group
of
people
who
ought
to
know
this
thoroughly,
or
at
least
have
a
view
are
the
bankruptcy
bar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
and
yet
there
are
no
briefs
from
them;
there
are
not...
there
is
no
article
that
i
could
find
in
bankruptcy
journal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
you
avoid...
what
about
their
statement
from
collier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
said...
a
pre-petition
claim,
if
a
creditor
incurs
the
attorneys'
fees
post-petition,
they
incur
it
post-petition,
afterwards
they
file,
after
the
petition
they
file
a
claim
with
the
bankruptcy
court,
in
exercising
or
protecting
a
pre-petition
claim
that
included
a
right
to
recover
attorneys'
fees.
and
they
say
that's
what
we
have,
we
had
a
contract
that
gave
us
this
right
to
attorneys'
fees.
the
fees
will
be
pre-petitioned
in
nature,
constituting
a
contingent
pre-petition
obligation
that
became
fixed
post-petition
when
the
fees
were
incurred.
all
right.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
because
506
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
tell
the
bankruptcy
courts--
how
to
deal
with
secured
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
that
is
exactly
what's
puzzling
me.
but
why
haven't
they
gone
out
and
got?
so
why...
what
you're
pointing
to
so
far
is
that
congress
has
said
a
particular
class
of
people
get
the
attorneys'
fees
out
of
the
security
insofar
as
the
security
will
support
it.
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
what
happens
to
the
attorneys'
fees
after
the
security
is
exhausted,
nor
about
anybody
else's
attorneys'
fees,
where
so
provided
by
contract.
colliers
says
they
can
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
same
puzzlement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
sell
you
a
house
and
i
make
a
promise
that
i'll
fix
any
leaks
in
the
bathroom.
and
lo
and
behold,
before
there's
a
leak
the...
i'm
bankrupt.
and
while
i'm
bankrupt
it
floods,
the
bathroom.
no
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
contingent
claim.
and
you're
saying
this
is
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
are
those
15
places...
do
they
involve
attorneys'
fees
as
administrative
expenses?
do
any
of
them
involve
attorneys'
fees
simply
as
an
unsecured
claim
for
attorneys'
fees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
is
the
answer
that
11
of
them
say
you
can
collect
attorneys'
fees,
but
only
as
an
unsecured
claim
against
creditors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
six.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
six
are
administrative,
and
then
the
remaining
two
say
that
the
creditor
can
collect
it
as
an
unsecured
debt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
are
those
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
seems
to
cut
the
other
way
because
it
says
it's
disallowed
insofar
as
it's
unreasonable
of
course,
and
therefore
it
would
be
allowed
insofar
as
it's
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean
you
don't
have
exactly
what
i
was
driving
to.
i
was
quite
interested
that
you
said
there
are
11
other
provisions
that
we
could
look
at
for
support,
and
i
wouldn't
think
it
was
support
if
those
consider...
concern
administrative
expenses,
which
nobody's
asking
for
here,
they
just
want
an
unsecured
claim,
or
if
they
concern
some
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--irrelevant
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
can
we
decide?
but
i'm
wondering
about,
maybe
you
don't
want
to
answer
this,
but
i
mean,
if
we
were
to
say
fobian
is
wrong,
everybody
will
agree
with
us.
but
we
should
have
to
say
why
it's
wrong.
and
if
we
say
the
reason
that
it's
wrong
is
because
you
can't
collect
attorneys'
fees
at
all,
you'll
be
delighted.
and
if
we
say
the
reason
it's
wrong
is
because
you
can
collect
attorneys'
fees
regardless,
they'll
be
delighted.
and
our
only
other
alternative
is
to
not
say
why
it's
wrong
or...
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
this
particular
set
of
pre-petition
obligations.
collier,
i
think
in
context
must
be
saying,
you
get
paid
the
money.
i
mean,
he
goes
on
in
the
next
sentence
and
says
by
the
way,
despite
my
last
sentence,
you
don't
get
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
in
other
words
what
he
implies,
if
i
ready
the
whole
page
i'll
see,
although
he
just
said
what
we
quoted,
the
whole
page
means,
by
the
way,
i'm
not
telling
you
if
you
get
the
money
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i'll--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
your
506(b)
argument,
i
see
your
point,
i
see
your
point,
is
there...
i
mean,
and
you'd
have
to
say
well,
506(b)
simply
repeats
506(a),
as
sometimes
provisions
do,
and
then
it
becomes
somewhat
superfluous,
somewhat
not.
i
got
that
point.
i
also
have
your
point
about,
well,
there
are
other
references.
now,
is
there
any
other
point
in
the
code?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
they
do
it
with
my
leaky
bathroom?
