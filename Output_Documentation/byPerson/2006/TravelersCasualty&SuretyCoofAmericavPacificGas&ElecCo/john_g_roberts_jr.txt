chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
05-1429,
travelers
casualty
and
surety
company
versus
pacific
gas
and
electric
company.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
in
that
case,
are
you
saying
that
routinely
the
lawyer
recovers
fees
in
the
bankruptcy
case
even
if
the
debtor,
the
debtor
was
insolvent?
and
we're
assuming
insolvency
in
the
hypothetical,
although
it
may
not
fit
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
may
be
no
briefs
from
them
because
it
isn't
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree,
counsel,
that
the
fobian
rule
is
both
narrower
and
broader
than
the
question
you
try
to
present.
for
example
it
applies
to
the
claims
of
a
secured
creditor
for
attorneys
fees
on
a
secured
claim
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why...
it
doesn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you're
an
oversecured
creditor
with
a
claim
for
attorneys'
fees
arising
under
solely
issues
of
matters
of
federal
bankruptcy
law,
the
fobian
rule
doesn't
prevent
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
everyone.
i'm
not
clear
on
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
is
a
rational
predicate,
we
might
have
expected
to
hear
about
it
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
an
ambush
and
it
is
smuggling
in
the
sense
we
don't
have
a
court
of
appeals
decision
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
question,
do
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
that's
true...
and
the
reason
for
that
i
suppose
is
that
doesn't
impair
the
rights
of
the
general
creditors
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it's
quite
unlike
the
situation,
for
example
in
timbers,
where
had
you
in
502
a
disallowance
of
post-petition
interest.
there
is
not
in
502
a
disallowance
of
attorneys'
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
brother
in
his
reply
brief
said
that
no
court
of
appeals
has
endorsed
your
theory,
and
i...
earlier
you
told
me
one
had.
which
one
in
particular?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
really
want
us
to
reach
out
and
decide
a
question
that's
not
presented
when
there
has
been
no
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
thought
the
fobian
rule
was
wrong,
you
could
have
said
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
added
complication.
there's
another
case
on
which
the
ninth
circuit's
based
its
decision
in
your
case,
deroche.
your
proposed
solution
here
doesn't
address
the
issue
in
deroche
because
there
it's
the
debtor
that's
seeking
attorneys'
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
still
have
to
decide
the
fobian
issue.
and
your
failure
to
defend
it
here
means
that
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
on
that
inadequate
record.
if
you
have
mentioned
that
in
an
opposition
to
certiorari,
perhaps
we
would
have
granted
cert
in
the
deroche
case
and
had
an
argument
about
the
rule
that
we
have
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
says
it's
more
favorable
to
say
the
claims
are
unimpaired.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
brunstad,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
05-1429,
travelers
casualty
&
surety
versus
pacific
gas
&
electric
co.
