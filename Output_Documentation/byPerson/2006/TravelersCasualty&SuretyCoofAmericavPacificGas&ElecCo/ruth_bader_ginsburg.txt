justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
this
bankruptcy
court
thought
about
the
claim.
this
bankruptcy
court
said
some
rather
critical
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
don't...
there
was
never
a
time
that
the
plan
said
we
are
not
going
to
pay
our
workers'
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
a
section
of
the
code
that
preserved
subrogation
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in...
in
this
case,
i
thought
that
if
a
contingency
claim
for
indemnification
is
not
allowed,
but
if
it
becomes
fixed
at
some
time,
then
the
claim
can
be
made
and
is
not
lost.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
502(e)(1).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
case,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the,
fobian,
so-called
fobian
issue,
whether
the
ninth
circuit
drew
the
bright
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
proper
to
remand
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider
those
other
arguments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
both
their
statutory
interpretation
and
the
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
can
we
be,
take
one
step
before
that
and
tell
us
if
you
are
conceding
that
the
fobian
rule
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
is
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
we
are
not
a
court
of
first
view
and
you
know
that
very
well.
we
are
a
court
of
review.
so
no
matter
how
well
it's
been
aired,
we
wait
to
see
what
the
lower
courts
have
said
on
a
question.
we
don't
take
it
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
that
because
they
have
the
fobian
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
doesn't
it
serve
the
purpose
of
saying
that
the
fees
will
be
covered
by
the
security?
they'll
not
be
just
be
claims
for
fees
that
would
stand
together
with
the
unsecured
creditors,
but
that
the
oversecured...
the
security
will
cover
the
interest,
will
cover
the
attorneys'
fees,
and
that's
the
function
of
506
whatever--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
raising
a
provision
that
says
just
that,
it's
the
absence
of
a
provision
for
attorneys'
fees
that
you're
relying
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
the
provision
that
generally
disallows
attorneys'
fees?
