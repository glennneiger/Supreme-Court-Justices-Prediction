mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit's
fobian
rule
creates
an
unwarranted
federal
common
law
rule
that
exists
outside
the
structure
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
bankruptcy
code
has
a
distinct
structure.
for
example,
if
a
debtor
has
a
right
to
an
attorneys'
fees
valid
under
state
law,
after
the
petition
date,
the
date
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy,
that
right
passes
to
the
bankruptcy
estate.
if
a
creditor
has
a
state
law
right
to
attorneys'
fees,
after
the
petition
date,
that
right
becomes
a
claim
in
bankruptcy.
the
ninth
circuit's
fobian
rule
intercepts
those
rights
even
before
we
get
to
what
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
or
does
to
them
and
basically
says,
if
you're
litigating
federal
issues,
you
simply
cannot
have
a
right
to
attorneys'
fees
unless
the
federal
law
authorizes
that
right,
in
this
case,
contractual
rights,
or
alternatively
rights
available
under
state
statute.
that,
we
submit,
is
an
impermissible
creation
of
a
federal
common
law
rule.
there
is
no
basis
for
it
under
this
court's
preemption
precedents.
there's
no
conflict
between
federal
policy
and
state
policy
which
would
justify
the
creation
of
the
rule,
and
accordingly,
it
is
unwarranted.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
depends,
justice
kennedy.
it
depends
on
what
their
contractual
right
provides.
here
we
have
a
contractual--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--then,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
it
probably
would
be
covered.
it
probably
would
be
covered
and
the
analysis--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
do
cite
to
collier,
where
we
talk
about
exactly
that
scenario
and
it
is
described.
and
it
basically
works
like
this.
a
claim
under
the
bankruptcy
code
is
defined
under
section
1015.
the
claim
includes
any
right
to
payment
whether
it's
contingent
or
fixed,
matured,
unmatured,
et
cetera.
any
right
to
payment,
literally
any
right
to
payment,
when
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy,
that
becomes
a
claim.
if
the
right--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
key
concept...
and
this
is
explained
clearly
in
collier...
is
where
does
the
right
come
from?
if
it
arises
out
of
a
pre-petition
contract,
then
the
right
is
pre-petition
in
nature,
even
though
the
fees
are
incurred
post-petition.
think
of
a
guarantee.
think
of
if
pg&e
had
guaranteed
its
parent's
debt
for
the
$100
million,
let's
say.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
right.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
exactly,
yes,
justice
stevens,
if
in
fact,
though,
the
creditor
bothers
to
assert
the
claim
for
fees
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
in
most
cases,
creditors
don't,
because
it's
not
worth
the
effort
of
asserting
the
claim
for
fees
subsequently.
in
cases
such
as
this,
where
you
have
a
solvent
debtor
who
can
pay
all
claims
in
full,
there's
no
reason
why
they
should
be
able
to
get
out
of
their
contractual
obligations
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
because
there's
a
transaction
cost
in
actually
filing
the
additional
claim
setting
forth
the
amount
that
you've
incurred.
in
most
cases,
justice
stevens,
creditors
don't
even
hire
attorneys
to
pursue
or
file
a
claim
in
bankruptcy.
in
most
chapter
7
cases,
for
example,
they
are
no-asset
cases.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
normally,
there's
no
distribution
on
unsecured
claims
in
most
bankruptcy
cases.
so
why
bother?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
typically,
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct.
but
in
cases
such
as
this,
where
the
attorneys'
fees
are
substantial,
the
debtor
is
solvent,
and
there
are
substantial--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--for
the
work
done
in
performing,
filing
the
proof
of
claim,
that's
correct.
and
even
though,
justice
kennedy,
the
attorney's
conduct
was
after
the
debtor
filed
for
bankruptcy,
the
right
to
payment
arises
out
of
the
pre-petition
contract.
again,
think
of
the
guarantee
hypothetical.
there
you
had
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
but
just
think
about
the
pre-petition
tort
claim,
where
there
has
been
exposure
to
asbestos
products
pre-petition,
but
the
injury
arises
post-petition.
it's
still
a
pre-petition
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
souter,
it's
different
in
this
sense.
this
is
an
indemnity,
all-loss
indemnity
provision.
the
surety
is
not
supposed
to
incur
any
loss,
any
cost
whatsoever,
for
supplying
these
surety
bonds
to
pg&e.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
it
has,
because
when
pg&e
filed
for
bankruptcy--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
souter,
you
can
visualize
bankruptcy
itself
as
being
a
default.
when
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy,
you
must
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court
to
present
your
rights--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
by
analogy,
justice
souter,
in
the
ltv
case,
the
same
posture
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future.
you
must
file
your
claim
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
in
ltv--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
that's
precisely
the
point
of
why
claim
is
defined
so
broadly
to
include
contingent
claims.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
absolutely
false,
justice
souter.
in
bankruptcy,
if
you
do
not
present
your
rights,
if
the
rights
of
the
workers
themselves
are
not
properly
treated,
they
are
lost.
under
section
1141,
they
are
extinguished.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
souter,
because
if
you
look
at
what
section
1141
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does,
it
provides
that
a
plan
of
reorganization
binds
all
parties.
if
you're
not
provided
for
adequately
in
the
plan
under
section
1141(d),
your
rights
are
extinguished
forever.
you
must
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court;
you
must
be
sure
that
the
rights
are
properly
characterized.
excuse
me.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
we
need
to
distinguish
two
different
things.
there
was
the
work
that
was
performed
in
preserving
the
rights
of
the
injured
employees,
to
make
sure
they
were
properly
classified,
that
their
rights
were
rendered
unimpaired.
if
that
hadn't
been
in
the
plan,
then
their
rights
would
have
been
extinguished
under
section
1141.
then
there
was
the
claim
that
the
surety
provides
for
having
had
to
have
done
all
of
that
work.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
problem,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
plan
said
nothing
at
all.
and
when
the
plan
says
nothing
at
all,
the
default
rule
in
bankruptcy
is
that
rights
are
extinguished;
they
are
discharged
under
section
1141(d).
it
must
be
in
the
plan
in
order
to
be
invalid
after
the
confirmation
of
the
plan.
we
had
to
assure
those
rights
were
properly
treated
in
the
plan,
because
if
they
weren't,
they
would
have
been
discharged
under
the
general...
general
discharge
provision.
that
is
why
one
must
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
one
must
file
a
proof
of
claim,
one
must
enforce
your
rights
in
bankruptcy;
if
you
don't,
you
lose
them.
that's
why
the
surety
here
stepped
forward,
said
it
has
subrogation
rights;
the
workers
have
rights.
and
the
bankruptcy
court
agreed
with
travelers.
it
directed
the
debtor
to
put
that
language
in
the
plan.
travelers--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that's
section
509,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
that's
not
what
i
was
speaking
of
just
momentarily.
the
rights
of
the
injured
employees,
the
workers,
when
they
filed
for...
when
pg&e
filed
for
bankruptcy,
the
injured
workers
had
claims.
they
were
going
to
receive
periodic
benefit
payments
off
into
the
future.
if
pg&e
had
not
properly
provided
for
those
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
case
in
their
plan,
those
claims
would
have
been
extinguished.
as
a
result,
though,
travelers
would
not
have
been
off
the
hook
on
its
surety
bond,
travelers
would
have
had
to
have
stepped
forward
and
make
the
payments
if
pg&e
did
not.
but
if
travelers
hadn't
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
said,
these
are
our
rights,
these
need
to
be
preserved,
its
recourse
against
pg&e
would
have
extinguished
as
well.
if
one
does
not
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
assert
one's
rights,
one
loses
them.
and
of
course,
creditors
when
they
do
have
to
assert
their
rights,
incur
attorneys'
fees
for
doing
so.
and
here
we
had
a
pre-petition
contract
that
said,
whatever
loss
we
incur,
including
attorneys'
fees,
we
have
a
right
to
recover,
a
right
to
payment.
that
becomes
the
claim.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
would
not
have
done
that
work.
no,
justice
souter,
because
the
injured
worker
him
or
herself
would
have
done
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
the,
the
treatment
of
the
workers
under
the
plan,
no.
with
respect
to--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
would
have
said,
in
our
proof
of
claim,
as
we
did:
if
we
must
make
payment
in
the
future,
we
are
entitled
to
two
things.
one,
we
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
from
pg&e
for
any
amount
that
we
must
spend
in
the
future
whenever
that
might
occur.
two,
if
we
have
to
pay
any
of
the
employees,
we
are
subrogated.
we
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
employees
and
may
assert
those
rights.
the
subrogation
right
would
have
been
fully
protected,
though,
justice
souter,
because
of
the
treatment
of
the
workers
in
the
plan
rendering
them
unimpaired.
we
would
have
left
simply...
with
simply
saying
we
have
these
reimbursement
rights
which
we
would
have
in
case
we
have
to
make
payment.
now,
in
the
ltv
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
papers,
at
the
beginning
of
the
ltv
case,
the
surety
who
has
had
$40
million
in
surety
bonds
was
in
a
position,
very
much
the
same
as
in
this
case,
when
pg&e
filed.
pg&e
got
an
order
authorizing
it
to
continue
to
pay
but
not
requiring
it
to
pay.
that
can
only
be
done
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
ltv
started
paying
the
workers'
comp
benefits,
but
then
defaulted
and
stopped,
long
after
the
bankruptcy
case
had
commenced,
but
far
short
of
when
it
concluded.
the
surety
had
to
step
up
to
the
plate
and
make
the
payments.
if
the
surety
had
not
filed
a
proof
of
claim
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
the
surety
would
have
lost
its
recourse
against
the
debtor,
ltv,
even
though
it
subsequently,
far
later,
had
to
make
payment.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
how
bankruptcy
works.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is
a
bar
date
set
in
the
beginning
of
chapter
11
cases.
you
must
file
your
claim
by
the
bar
date
or
you'll
be
forever
barred,
even
if
your
liability
becomes
fixed
later.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
if
your
reimbursement
claim
is
contingent,
it
will
be
disallowed,
subject
to
reconsideration
under
section
502(j).
and
that's
what
the
parties
stipulated
to
in
this
case
in
our
stipulation.
we
filed
our
proof
of
claim,
then
pg&e
objected
to
our
proof
of
claim,
but
justice
ginsburg,
pg&e
did
a
lot
more
than
just
object
to
our
contingent
reimbursement
rights.
they
mischaracterized
our
subrogation
rights
as
claims;
they
sought
to
disallow
our
subrogation
claims;
and
they
sought
to
subordinate
our
claims.
plus
in
addition,
they
sought
to
disallow
the
claims
of
the
injured
workers.
so
we
had
to
respond
to
the
litigation
that
was
commenced.
we
had
to
defend
our
rights,
and
we
were
successful.
the
workers'
claims
were
ultimately
left
unimpaired
in
the
bankruptcy
as
they
should
have
been.
pg&e
was
fully
responsible
for
paying
the
workers'
claims.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
fobian
rule,
we
submit,
is
an
impermissible
creation
of
federal
common
law.
it's
not
justified
by
any
concept
of
preemption;
there
is
no
conflict
with
bankruptcy
policy--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
depends,
justice
kennedy.
if
state
law,
if
it's
an
unsecured
claim
under
section
501(b)(1)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
this
case,
that
would
be
a
determination
under
state
law.
every
state,
your
honor,
has
a
reasonableness
requirement.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
under
section
501(b)(1)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--if
state
law
provides
for
it,
and
all
states
do.
the
bankruptcy
court
adopts
the
state
reasonableness
standard
for
unsecured
claims
under
section
502(b)(1).
yes,
justice
breyer?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
security--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--and
in--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--absolutely,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
breyer
it
happens
all
the
time.
in
our
brief,
we
cite
to
many,
many
cases
in
which
attorneys'
fees
are
allowed
as
unsecured
claims.
it's
actually
been
happening
for
over
100
years,
it
happened
in
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1998.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
a
key
case
we
cited,
the
second
circuit's
decision,
united
manufacturers
and
merchants,
where
they
didn't
even
hire
an
attorney
until
after
the
bankruptcy
case
was
filed,
the
attorney
performed
services,
filing
a
proof
of
claim,
protecting
the
equitable
rights,
and
the
second
circuit
clearly
held
that
those
attorneys'
fees
were
properly
part
of
the
unsecured
claim,
but
it
couldn't
be
any
clearer.
and
the
second
circuit--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there
is,
justice
stevens,
but
those
are
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
compared
to
this
court,
certainly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
important
to
say
that
the
alternative
rule
that
pg&e
asked
for
is
one
that
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
addressed
has
rejected.
what
they
are
saying
is,
oh,
you
can't
get
your
attorneys'
fees
based
on
a
construction
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
no
court
of
appeals
has
accepted
it.
there
are
some
lower
bankruptcy
court
decisions
that
have
accepted
it,
but
that
is
routinely
overturned
on
appeal.
the
issue
of
whether
you
get
your
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
an
unsecured
claim,
cohen
versus
de
la
cruz,
in
that
case
this
court
had
to
construe
whether
the
term
debt,
which
means
under
the
bankruptcy
code
the
same
thing
as
a
claim,
is
defined
as
liability
on
a
claim,
there
the
court,
this
court
concluded
that
that
debt
included
attorneys'
fees,
the
treble
damages,
the
whole
nine
yards.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--chief
justice
roberts,
that's
correct.
and
our
view
is
that
the
court
should
deal
only
with
the
fobian
rule.
and
the
alternative
argument
which
respondent
presented
was
never
argued
below,
was
not
decided
below,
was
not
presented
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
it's
been
rejected
by
every
single
court
of
appeals--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court
should
do.
it
should
remand
their
statutory
interpretation
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider,
for
the
lower
courts
to
consider.
this
court
deserves
more
than
just
a
20-page
reply
brief
in
response
to
80
pages
of
briefing
by
the
other
side
on
an
issue
that
was
never
raised
below,
not
presented
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari.
remand
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
with
respect
to
their
claim.
i
do
believe
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
the
contract,
reasonableness,
all
of
those
issues.
the
circuit
split,
which
we
presented
to
the
court,
and
which
i
understand
certiorari
was...
well,
i'm
guessing...
certiorari
was
granted
on,
it
deals
with
the
fobian
rule.
as
this
common
law
rule,
this
sort
of
construct,
that
if
you're
litigating
federal
law
issues,
well,
as
a
matter
of
general
federal
common
law,
you
can't
get
the
attorneys'
fees
unless
it's
authorized
by
federal
law.
and
our
brief
was
entirely
devoted
to
that.
you
can't
justify
that
rule
in
our
view
under
preemption
principles;
there's
no
conflict;
there
is
no
congress
preempting
the
field
in
any
way;
you
can't
justify
this
under
atherton
as
a,
as
a...
something
that's
necessary
because
of
a
conflict
with
federal
policy.
and
also
the
fobian
rule
is
inappropriately
categorical,
in
violation
of
what
we
submit
are
these
court's
principles
in
the
nolan
case,
in
the
cf
and
i
case.
in
those
cases,
the
court
said:
it's
not
for
the
courts
to
create
these
claims
processing
rules
in
bankruptcy.
but
that
exactly
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens.
that
would
be
appropriate
on
remand.
i
reserve
the
balance--
of
my
time.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
breyer,
in
our
brief
on
pages
25
and
26,
we
cite
to
a
number
of
cases
where
the
courts
allowed
attorneys'
fees
as
an
unsecured
claim,
both
for
pre-petition
work
done
and
also
post-petition
work
done
where
the
contractual
right
was
pre-petitioned.
we
also
cite
a
bunch
of
cases
around
page
44...
43
and
44
of
our
brief,
including
an
article
in
the
middle
of
page
44,
quote:
"in
cases
decided
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
higher
courts
consistently
held
that
attorneys'
fees
were
allowable
even
as
unsecured
claims
in
bankruptcy.
"
close
quote.
i've
been
a
bankruptcy
lawyer
for
over
20
years.
i've
been
teaching
bankruptcy
law
for
17
years.
it
is
absolutely
not
true
that
courts
routinely
disallow
claims
for
attorneys'
fees
as
part
of
unsecured
claims.
it's
the
opposite
is
true
it's
routine
that
they
are
allowed
in
practical
reality
however
they
are
not
presented
because
creditors
don't
bother
to
present
them
because
distributions
are
generally
so
low
in
bankruptcy.
on
the
point
about
the
plan
completely
protected
the
rights
of
the
injured
workers,
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
the
provision
that
counsel
cites
in
the
plan
refers
to
exec,
as
executory
contracts,
workers'
compensation
benefit
programs.
those
are
the
contractual
relationships
between
pg&e
and
its
administrators,
not
the
claims
of
the
workers
themselves.
tellingly,
pg&e
never
argued
in
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
claims
of
the
workers
were
fine
under
the
plan.
in
fact,
they
said,
we
will
do
what
travelers
wants
after
the
bankruptcy
court
directed...
and
it's
in
the
transcript...
that
that
was
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
in
fact,
what
travelers
insisted
is
required
by
section
1123
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
claims
such
as
the
workers'
must
be
classified,
their
treatment
must
be
specified.
if
they
are
not
they
are
eliminated.
the
reference
to
executory
contracts
clearly
doesn't
apply.
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
the
workers'
claims
were
not
executory
contracts
under
applicable
law.
that
section
does
not
apply.
of
course,
i
think,
chief
justice
roberts,
there
is
a
lot
more
that
we
would
like
to
say
about
their
alternative
arguments
than
we
were
able
to
put
in
our
20-page
reply
brief.
the
issue
that
they
raised
has
not
been
fully
ventilated
in
the
lower
courts.
in
fact,
there
are
many
more
things
we
would
say
about
it
on
remand.
i
also
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
justice
stevens,
they
are
a
solvent
debtor,
and
under
the
concept
of
absolute
priority
shareholders
are
not
allowed
to
recover
anything
unless
creditors
are
paid
in
full.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
they're
trying
to
get
rid
of
their
contractual
obligations
in
bankruptcy
for
the
benefit
of
their
shareholders.
there's
no
implication
between
creditors,
creditors'
recoveries
in
this
case
one
versus
the
other.
in
the
dow
corning
case
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
the
sixth
circuit
expressly
held
where
you
have
a
solvent
debtor
you
have
to
pay
all
of
the
attorneys'
fees.
that
is
an
additional
argument
we
would
develop
on
remand.
but
all
of
their
arguments
about
section
506
and
their
interpretation
of
502
simply
don't
matter,
because
as
a
solvent
debtor
they're
not
entitled
to
take
advantage
of
that
theory
even
if
it
were
valid.
and
we
contend
that
it
isn't
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
have
resoundingly
rejected
it.
the
second
circuit
rejected
it
in
united
merchants
and
manufacturers.
the
sixth
circuit
rejected
it
in
dow
corning.
the
eleventh
circuit
it
en
banc
in
the
wellsville
case.
all
of
them
considered
the
506
argument
that
they're
making
and
rejected
it,
and
properly
so.
counsel
cites
to
section
502(b)(4).
that's
an
important
section
because
that
demonstrates
that
congress
understood
that
attorneys'
fees
would
be
allowable
as
an
unsecured
claim
under
section
502.
and
in
section
502(b)(4)
it
provided
the
only
exception,
the
only
one
where
attorneys'
fees
would
not
be
allowable
as
an
unsecured
claim.
it
provided
expressly
attorneys'
fees
would
not
be
allowable
for
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
to
the
extent
the
claim
for
the
fees
exceeded
the
reasonable
value
of
the
services
performed.
why
is
that
provision
there?
because
congress
saw
there
was
a
problem.
there
was
a
problem
of
debtors
sending
money
to
their
attorneys.
congress
understood
that
to
be
a
problem
and
it
remedied
it.
congress
did
not
think
there
was
a
problem
with
respect
to
this
historic
practice
of
going
on
over
100
years
of
attorneys'
fees
being
allowed
as
unsecured
claims,
and
so
in
section
502
it
allows
them.
respondents'
argument
about
section
506(b)
renders
section
502(b)(4)
superfluous.
if
attorneys'
fees
were
never
allowable
as
part
of
an
unsecured
claim
except
for
how
506(b)
allows
it,
then
there
would
not
be
a
need
for
section
502(b)(4).
in
addition,
respondent
overstates
the
office
of
section
506.
506,
as
this
court
explained
in
ron
pair,
provides,
essentially
tells
us
what
secured
creditors
get
out
of
their
collateral
and
in
what
order...
the
pre-petition
amount
and
then,
if
there's
any
value
left,
the
value
of
the
collateral.
after
you
pay
the
pre-petition
amount
of
the
claim,
you
can
add
attorneys'
fees
and
you
can
add,
post-petition
you
can
add
interest.
their
interpretation
of
section
506(b)
would
render
section
502(b)(2)
superfluous.
under
their
theory,
only
oversecured
creditors
get
post-petition
interest,
get
interest.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
already
happens,
justice
kennedy.
in
all
the
circuits
that
recognize
that
attorneys'
fees
are
allowed
as
unsecured
claims,
that
already
happens.
and
that
has
not
cause
any
disaster
or
any
problem.
it's
been
a
practice
for
100
years.
if
congress
had
wished
to
change
the
practice,
it
would
have
when
it
codified
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1979.
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
perceived
it
to
be
a
problem
demonstrates
that
congress
wanted
to
leave
the
practice
unchanged.
now,
what
happens,
though,
again,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
creditors
don't
bother
to
file
claims
for
those
amounts.
and
where
it
matters
is
in
cases
where
it
should
matter,
like
in
this
case,
in
the
pg&e
case,
where
a
solvent
debtor
is
simply
trying
to
get
out
of
its
contractual
relationships.
and
under
principles
of
absolute
priority
they
are
not
allowed
to
do
that
for
the
benefit
of
shareholders
where
creditors
are
not
being
paid
in
full.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
underscore
again,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
stevens,
what
i
take,
what
i
take
from
their
analysis
is
a
hostility
towards
attorneys'
fees
being
allowed
in
bankruptcy.
and
perhaps
maybe
as
a
matter
of
policy,
if
we
were
to
start
from
scratch,
well,
maybe
we
shouldn't
allow
attorneys'
fees
to
be
allowed
in
bankruptcy.
maybe
we
shouldn't
allow
tort
claims
to
be
allowed
in
bankruptcy.
maybe
we
shouldn't
allow
certain
kinds
of
environmental
claims
to
be
allowed
in
bankruptcy.
they
don't
like
the
rule,
apparently,
but
their
analysis
of
the
history
is
wrong.
and
we
cite
innumerable
cases
and
law
review
articles
that
demonstrate
that
the
practice
is
as
we
say
that
it
is.
and
policy
reasons
are
no
grounds
to
sort
of
create
these
federal
common
law
rules
or
these
categorical
rules
of
preclusions.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens.
the
randolph
case
was
decided
in
1903
and
the
law
changed
dramatically
since
then.
for
example,
in
1903
contingent
claims
were
not
provable
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
changed
in
1938
when
contingent
claims
became
provable
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
randolph
&
randolph
versus
scruggs
involved
the
claim
of
a
custodian,
a
custodian,
an
assignee,
who
took
control
of
all
the
debtor's
assets
before
the
bankruptcy
filing.
now
under
section
503(b)(3)(e),
the
randolph
versus
scruggs
analysis
as
it
pertains
to
the
claims
of
the
assignee,
those
are
now
treated
as
an
administrative
expense
under
section
503
dealing
with
administrative
expenses.
in
randolph,
it's
interesting,
the
fees...
justice
kennedy,
the
fees
incurred
in
preparing
the
assignment
were
allowed
as
an
unsecured
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
justice
holmes
for
the
court
said
they
are
allowed.
so
in
fact
randolph
i
think
refutes
their
analysis
rather
than
supports
it.
