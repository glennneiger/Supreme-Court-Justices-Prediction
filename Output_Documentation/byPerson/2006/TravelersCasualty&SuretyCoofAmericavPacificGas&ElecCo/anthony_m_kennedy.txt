justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me...
this
is
just
basic
bankruptcy.
i
should
know,
but
i
looked
it
up
and
couldn't
find
it.
a
standard
promissory
note
which
provides
for
attorneys'
fees,
the
holder
of
the
note
is
the
creditor,
the
maker
of
the
note
is
the
bankrupt...
the
maker
of
the
note
goes
bankrupt.
the
holder
of
the
note
gets
his
attorney
and
says:
file
a
claim
in
bankruptcy.
and
the
attorney
sends
him
a
bill.
is
the
attorneys'
fees,
the
attorney
fee
for
filing
the
bankruptcy
claim,
recoverable
as
part
of
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
the
standard,
it's
the
standard
attorneys'
fee
provision,
all
attorneys'
fees
in
connection
with
collection
of
this
note
and
enforcement
of
the
terms
of
this
note.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
something
where
i
can
look
that
up
in
collier?
are
there
millions
of
cases?
i
mean,
this
seems
to
me
fairly
rudimentary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
but
in
my
case,
it's
a
post-petition
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
in
the
hypothetical,
i
would
think
that
in
many
cases,
there's
going
to
be
some
payout
for
the
promissory
note,
and
the
holder
of
the
note
tells
his
attorneys:
make
sure
i
get
that
claim
in
bankruptcy.
the
attorney
files
a
claim.
and
every
attorney
that
files
a
claim
for
a
promissory
note
which
is
entitled
to
a
fee
from
the
bankruptcy
court
for
filing
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
just
ask
you
about
the
fobian,
and
i
know
justice
breyer
has
a
question.
let's
assume
that
you're
correct
in
that
the
fees
are
allowable.
can
the
bankruptcy
court
make
the
determination
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
if
the
bankruptcy
judge
isn't
sure
of
what
the
amount
is,
he
looks
to
state
law
to
determine
the
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
bankruptcy
court
does
determine
reasonableness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
but...
but
we
are
talking
about
attorneys'
fees
for
services
performed
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
cost
of
filing
the
claim,
the
cost
of
talking
to
the
bankruptcy
judge,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
say
it
doesn't
go
far
enough
then
i
infer
from
that
you
say
that
it's
valid
as
far
as
it
goes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
ginsburg
has
a
question
i'm
very
interested
in.
do
you
defend
the
fobian
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
doesn't...
and
then
you
have
the
negative
inference
or
the
exclusio
unius
argument,
whatever,
which
i
think
is
misplaced
in
this
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
timbers
cited,
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
the
interest
section
in--
506.
that's
all
it's
about.
i
don't...
i
think
timbers
is
misleading
on
this
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
attorney
for
the
debtor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
point
you
disagree
with
the
collier
citation
at
page
9
of
the
reply
brief
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
says
if
the
creditor
incurs
the
attorneys'
fees
post
petition
in
connection
with
protecting
a
pre-petition
claim--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
fees
will
be
pre-petition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
am
concerned
about
your
point
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
attorneys'
fees
contracts
out
there
and
if
everybody
can
get
fees
for
filing
the
claim
post-petition
act,
we
have
a
huge
amount
of
claims
to
pay.
travelers
would
tell
us,
though,
that
a
surety
is
different,
that
they
somehow
stand
in
the
shoes
of
pg&e
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail,
why
can't
every
attorney
who
represents
a
creditor
who
has
a
credit
card
or
a
promissory
note
providing
for
attorneys'
fees
file
something
in
bankruptcy
and
get
attorneys'
fees
for
the
filing
of
the
claim?
