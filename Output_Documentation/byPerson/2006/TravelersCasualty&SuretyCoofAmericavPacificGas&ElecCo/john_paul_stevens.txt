justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
back
up
just
for
a
second?
supposing
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
that
the
services
have
not
been
performed.
it's
post-petition
conduct
by
the
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
worth...
i
know
here.
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
worth
the
effort,
instead
of
getting
$90
on
the
note,
to
get
95?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
telling
me
just
based
on
your
experience
that
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
normally,
no
fees
are
recovered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assuming
in
those
cases
where
there's
some
distribution,
is
it
correct,
as
i'm
assuming
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
the
normal
practice
is
you
don't
bother
because
there
is
not
enough
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
pre-petition
contract,
but
not
out
of
pre-petition
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i
don't...
there
is
a
body
of
law
on
the
other
side
of
that
issue,
too,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
absolutely.
the
second
circuit
is
a
lower
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
right.
there
are
no
cases
from
this
court
speaking
to
this
precise
issue,
are
there?
on
which
there
is
a
disagreement
among
the
lower
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
quick
question,
if
i
may.
would
one
of
the
issues
open
on
remand
be
the
construction
of
the
contract?
is
there
an
issue
at
state
law
as
to
whether
travelers
pays
for
these
particular
services?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
then
isn't
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
to
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider
all
these
other
arguments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that.
your
argument
depends...
you
analogize...
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
if
this
was
an
oversecured,
secured
creditor
they'd
be
entitled
to
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assuming,
assuming
the
contract
provides
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
so,
why
isn't
their
argument
that,
well,
your
client
is
solvent,
the
complete
answer
to
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
argue
it
in
their
reply
brief
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
will
not
have
any
adverse,
if
i
understand
the
facts,
any
adverse
impact
whatsoever
on
any
unsecured
creditor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
just
looking
at
this
case
itself,
if
there
is
plenty
of
money
there
to
pay
a
state
law
obligation,
why
shouldn't
just
ordinary
rules
of
contract
law
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
interesting.
you're
of
course
a
teacher
too.
the
amicus
brief
by
a
bunch
of
professors
has
a
different
view
of
the
history
than
you're
describing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
a
word
about
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
the
scruggs
case.
