justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
went
a
little
bit
beyond
that.
i
mean,
the...
justice
marshall
announced
not
merely
the
possibility
of
inherent
prejudice,
but
he
spoke
in
terms
of
practices
that
raised
a
risk
that
improper
factors
would
come
into
play
in
the
jury
decision.
isn't
that
the
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
criterion.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
way
he
formulated
it.
that's
the
way
the
court
in
flynn
formulated
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
the
end
point
that
they
were
reaching,
and
then
he
elaborated
on
that
by
referring
to
the
unacceptable
risk
that
improper
considerations
would
come
into
play.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
the
criterion
of
the
test
or
the
standard,
however
you
want
to
describe
it
in
flynn,
you've
got
to
get
that
latter
point
about
unacceptable
risk
of
improper
factors.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
button
had
said...
the
three
buttons
had
said
"hang
musladin",
would
you
say
that
there
was
not...
there
was
not
sufficiently
clear
law
from
this
court
to
find
that
practice
unconstitutional
under
justice
marshall's
formulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
both
want
to
know
why
you
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
what
are
the...
getting
into
the
formulation,
what
are
the
impermissible
factors
as
to
which
a
risk
is
raised
by
wearing
the
"hang
musladin"
button?
what
are
those
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
wrong
with
that?
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
get
up
and
urge
the
jury
to
convict
him.
what
is
wrong
with
it
on
the
button?
what
risk
does
the
button
raise
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
does
not?
that's
what
we're
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
simply
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
which
i
thought
i
was
doing,
maybe
i
wasn't
clear
about
it,
but
the
button
is
different.
instead
of
putting
a
picture
of
the
victim,
it's
got
the
statement,
"hang
musladin".
it's
worn
every
day
by
three
members
of
his
family
who
sit
behind
the
prosecution
table
within
the
sight
of
the
jury.
assume
those
facts.
would
habeas
relief
be
required
under
the
general
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
way
of
saying
that
it's
required?
should...
look,
should
a
court
grant
habeas
relief
on
my
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
grieving
or
not,
but
i
certainly
know
the
sentiment
that
they
are
trying
to
convey
to
the
jury
if
they
wear
a
button
that
says
"hang
musladin".
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
may
not
want
him
hung.
they
may
not
believe
in
the
death
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
assuming
that
explicit
message,
could
habeas
relief
be
granted
in
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
reasonable
for
a
state
court
to
say
that
three
family
members
sitting
in
a
courtroom
within
sight
of
the
jury
for
whatever
number
of
days
the
trial
ran,
saying
at
the
guilt
stage,
hang
so
and
so,
is
exposing
the
jury
to
a
proper
influence,
that
it
should,
and
may
consider
in
deciding
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
don't
you
concede
that
of
course
that
would
be
exposing
the
jury
to
an
improper
influence,
in
the
"hang
musladin"
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
hypo
is
at
the
guilt
stage,
not
the
sentencing
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
guilt
stage,
is
there
any,
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
that
allowing
the
family
members
to
display
this
message
to
a
jury
throughout
the
trial
at
the
guilt
stage
is
raising
a
risk,
an
unacceptable
risk,
that
the
jury
will
consider
improper
influences
in
reaching
its
verdict?
is
there
any
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
my
hypothetical.
my
buttons,
"hang
musladin",
is
there
any
question
about
the
risk
of
improper
influence
on
my
hypothetical?
not
this
case,
my
hypothetical.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
if
it
didn't,
though,
i
suppose
you
could
draw
a
line
between
people
who
were
doing
what
they
naturally
do,
and
some
people
do
wear
mourning,
and
some
people
will
come
into
a
courtroom
and
be
reminded
of
the
person
who
died
and
sob.
but
in
this
case,
they're
going
out
of
their
way
to
do
something
that
people
in
mourning
do
not
normally
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
you've
got...
i
think
you've
got
a
stronger
argument.
the
problem
that
i
have
in
this
case
is
that,
number
one,
i
view
the
wearing
of
the
buttons,
as
i
just
described
it,
as
something
that
is
abnormal
and
something
that
is
intended
to
presumably
get
the
jury's
attention.
i
don't
know
why
otherwise
they
would
be
doing
it.
and
from
whatever
source,
we
do
know
that
the
button
was
at
least
two
inches
wide
and
maybe
larger.
so
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
jury
saw
it
and
understood
perfectly
that
these
were
people
who
were
raising,
in
effect,
an
issue
of
sympathy.
i
can
understand
that,
and
under
the
general
rule
out
of
williams
and
flynn,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
pretty
darn
good
argument
for
saying,
yes,
an
unacceptable
risk
has
been
raised
of
emotionalism
in
the
jury's
deliberations
as
opposed
to
dispassionate
consideration
of
courtroom
evidence.
what,
however,
do
i
make
of
the
fact
that
not
one
single
court
has
ever
reached
that
conclusion
and...
you
know,
as
a
constitutional
matter?
am
i
in
the
position
of
sort
of
being
jim,
and
they're
all
out
of
step
with
jim?
i'm
raising
a
question
about
my
own
judgment
in
relation
to
the
fact
that
no
other
court
seems
to
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
what
do
you
think
i
should
make
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
to
depend
on
there
being
a
message?
isn't
it
enough
if
there
is
an
influence
that
is
conveyed?
i
mean,
what
i
thought
the
problem
was,
was
that
there
was
as
a
result
of
the
obtrusive
wearing
of
the
button,
that
it
created
a
risk
simply
of
an
emotional
approach
to
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
jurors
are
more
likely
to
feel
sorry
for
the
family
members
sitting
there
a
few
feet
away
from
them.
perhaps
they
may
be
more
likely
to
feel
sorry
for
the
victim,
but
certainly
for
the
family
members.
and
it
would
be
that
improper
influence
of
emotionalism
as
opposed
to
a
particular
message
that
is
the
problem
here,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
accept
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
