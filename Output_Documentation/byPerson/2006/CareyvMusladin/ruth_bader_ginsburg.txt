justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
concerned
here
with
the
court
of...
the
role,
if
any,
that
a
circuit
court,
that
opinions
of
courts
other
than
this
court
have
in
determining
whether
law
is
clearly
established.
do
you
exclude
entirely
from
the
province
of
what
is
proper
for
the
federal
court
to
consider
any
court
of
appeals,
federal
court
of
appeals
decisions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
only
thing...
your
argument
is
the
only
thing
that
is
proper
to
look
to
are
decisions
of
this
court,
and
that
if
you
don't
have
a
case
on
all
fours,
as
we
have
no
buttons
case,
then
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
there
be
any
difference
if
this
had
been
a
post-aedpa...
if
the
circuit
precedent
had
been
post-aedpa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
language
came
from
one
of
our
opinions,
didn't
it?
the
branding
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can't
fault
the
court
for
just
saying
it
isn't
that.
mr.
ott
says
it
isn't
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
here
it...
you
agree
that
the
california
court
has
as
much
authority
to
say
what
federal
law
is
as
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
they
are
on
a
par.
ninth
circuit
decisions
in
no
way
binds
the
supreme
court
of
california.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
this
state
court
of
appeals
chose
to
be
respectful
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
consider
what
it
had
said,
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
a
very
strong
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
williams
and
flynn
and
all
of
the
cases
that
we
have
had,
whatever
way
they
went,
it
was
always
the
government
requiring
a
defendant
to
do
something,
wear
prison
clothes,
appear
in
court
with
shackles.
and
in
the
case
that
went
for
the
government,
the
extra
officers
in
the
courtroom.
we
haven't
had
a
case,
have
we,
where
it
is
spectator
conduct
as
opposed
to
government
conduct
that's
being
attacked?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
certainly
goes
beyond
where
our
precedent
leaves
off.
that
is,
we
are
dealing
with
direct
impositions
by
government
in
a
way
that
poses
an
unacceptable
risk
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
have
been...
haven't
there
been
court
decisions
that
have
held
that
buttons
didn't
compromise
a
fair
trial
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision,
how
could
we
say
federal
law
was
clearly
established
when
other
courts
considering
our
precedent
have
gone
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
time
when
the
trial
judge
said
stop.
was
there
not?
he
initially
denied
the
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
there
was
a
time
in
the
course
of
the
trial
when
he
told
the
family
members
to
stop
wearing
the
buttons.
