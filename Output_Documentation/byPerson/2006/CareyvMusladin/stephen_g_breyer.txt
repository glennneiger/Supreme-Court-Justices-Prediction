justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
there
be
here?
i
mean,
at
some
point,
at
some
point,
seeing
every
judge
in
this
case
say
this
is
a
thoroughly...
no,
let
me
not
exaggerate.
but
they
say
wearing
buttons
is
a
bad
idea.
for
obvious
reasons.
now,
at
some
point,
if
enough
judges
say
that,
each
time
they
say,
well,
it
is
a
bad
idea,
but
we
can't
say
in
this
case
that
it
was
so
prejudicial,
there's
that
inherent
risk
that
it's
unconstitutional.
but
if
some
point,
if
people
begin
enough
is
enough
to
say,
this
is
quite
a
bad
idea
to
have
buttons
being
worn
in
a
courtroom,
which
is
not
a
place
for
demonstration,
does
it
not
become
pretty
clear,
irrespective
of
exactly
what
opinions
say
what,
that
this
is
just
very
unfair
and
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely
right.
suppose
you
think
in
this
federal
court,
which
we
are,
that
banners,
posters,
and
buttons
are
a
thoroughly
bad
idea.
now,
why?
not
just
because
of
decorum.
but
because
they
introduce
an
extraneous
factor
into
the
judgment
of
the
jury.
and
suppose
i
also
think...
i'm
not
saying
i
do,
i'm
trying
this
out...
but
it
is
pretty
hard
to
draw
lines
among
buttons.
it
is
pretty
hard
to
draw
lines
among
banners.
and
the
only
way
to
guarantee
fair
trials
in
whole...
is
to
have
a
wholesale
rule
on
this.
no
buttons,
no
banners,
no
petitions,
no
posters.
how
would
you
explain...
you
just
say
the
law
just
doesn't
permit
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
that?
because
that
is
a
concern
i
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
key
sentence
in
this
is
he
says
the
simple
photograph
of
tom
studer
on
a
button
which...
i
don't
know
what
the
size
is.
nobody
has
told
them
what
the
button
is
about.
nobody
has
put
for
the
judge
a
picture
of
it.
nobody
showed
him
what
the
button
is.
so
he
says
a
simple
photograph
of
tom
studer
was
unlikely
to
have
been
taken
as
anything
other
than
the
normal
grief
occasioned
by
the
loss
of
a
family
member.
period.
now,
what
else
is
there
to
say?
that's
the
court's
conclusion.
and
it
is
pretty
hard
for
me...
i
looked
for
the
button.
i
couldn't
even
find
the
button
in
the
record.
i
didn't
even
know
what
this
looks
like.
it
is
a
button,
somebody
later
must
have
said
two
inches
to
four
inches.
i
don't
know
who
said
that.
i
don't
know
how
the
judge
could
have
known
that.
the
button
isn't
in
the
record.
so
why
isn't
it
just
a
normal
sign
of
grief
unlikely
to
influence
anybody?
that's
what
they
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
goes
on
frequently
in
an
opinion.
i
have
been
known
to
do
that
myself.
and
i
say
this
court
over
here
says
it's
a
da-da-da,
and
i
say
"sure
isn't
that".
well,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
was
the...
what
in
your
opinion...
this
is
why...
as
you
can
see,
i'm
concerned
about
buttons.
i
think
they're
probably
a
problem.
i
think
all
judges
are
concerned
about
them.
but
then
i
think
about
this
particular
case.
and
i
look
at
that
single
sentence:
"it
was
unlikely
to
be
taken
as
a
sign
of
anything
other
than
normal
grief.
"
i
mean,
suppose
this
had
been
a
different
case.
suppose
the
defense
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
smith
didn't
pull
the
trigger.
it
was
an
unknown
person
called
jones.
then
if
i
were
on
the
jury,
i
would
look
out,
see
the
buttons,
and
i'd
say,
hmmm,
the
family
thinks
it
was
smith.
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
here
with
those
buttons.
i
could
think
that.
but
this
isn't
that
case.
this
is
a
case
where
everyone
thinks
your
client
pulled
the
trigger.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
family's
son
came
at
him
with
a
machete.
so
when
i
look
at
the
buttons,
i'd
think
sure,
they
don't
think
the
son
came
at
him
with...
i
mean,
they
don't
think
that.
he's
their
son.
what
would
you
expect
them
to
think?
so
that's
why
i
thought
that
they
are
saying
that
sentence,
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
taken
as
sign
of
grief
and
nothing
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
reason...
suppose,
hypothetically,
i
would
think...
well,
the
rule
should
be
no
buttons.
no
buttons,
no
signs,
no
banners.
a
courtroom
is
a
place
of
fair
trial,
not
a
place
for
a
demonstration
of
any
kind.
now,
if
i
were
to
think
that,
and
i
also
were
to
think
it's
just
too
difficult
to
figure
out
case
by
case
whether
there
is
or
is
not
an
improper
influence,
suppose
i
thought
both
of
those
things.
now,
you've
heard,
quite
rightly,
the
other
side
says:
one,
you're
supposed
to
decide
whether
this
was
clear
in
the
law.
two,
if
you're
worried
about
the
future,
you
can't
lay
down
a
rule
that's
clear
in
the
law
either
because
of
a,
aedpa,
and
b,
the
case
that
was
cited,
which
said
it's
holdings
that
count,
not
dicta.
all
right.
you
write
for
me
the
words
i'm
supposed
to
put
on
paper
to
achieve
your
position.
