where
does
it
say
in
there
that
the
buttons
were
worn
every
day?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
says
that
the
family
members
were
there
every
day,
or
for
many
days.
it
doesn't
say
they
wore
the
buttons
every
day,
unless
i'm
missing--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
his
opinion
on
denial
of
rehearing,
judge
kleinfeld
on
the
ninth
circuit
made
the
point
that
at
criminal
trials...
and
i
suppose
at
other
trials...
it
is
an
accepted
feature
of
the
proceeding
that
there
are
going
to
be
spectators
who
identify
with
one
or
the
other
party.
and
there
may
be
relatives
of
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
there
may
be
relatives
of
the
victims.
and
it's
apparent
from
their
behavior
what
they
think
about
the
case
and
which
side
should
win.
and
that's
sort
of
a
baseline
that
has
to
be
accepted
in
judging,
not
whether
wearing
buttons
is
good
as
a...
whether
we
think
it
would
be
good
if
we
were
announcing
a
court
rule,
but
whether
there's
a
violation
of
due
process.
do
you
accept
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
is
it
about
these
particular
buttons
that's
reflected
in
the
record
that
shows
that
it
goes
significantly
beyond
what
would
be
inferred
just
from
that
rather
common
feature
of
trials?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
there
a
greater
risk?
why
do
the
buttons
convey...
involve
a
greater
risk
than
the
kind
of
behavior
that
judge
kleinfeld
was
referring
to?
