justice
antonin
scalia
to
apply
an
opinion
of
this
court
to
particular
circumstances,
and
find
that
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
produces
a
certain
result
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
that
is
clearly
established
supreme
court
law.
it
just
means
that
it
is
their
best
guess
as
to
how
it
comes
out,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they're
forced
to
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other,
the
supreme
court
opinion
either
means
this
or
that.
they're
not
applying
a
clearly
established
test
to
the
supreme
court,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
also
don't
allow
people
to
come
into
most
courtrooms
in
tank
shirts,
and
we
don't
allow
people
to,
you
know,
to
wear
beany
hats.
everything
that
is
inappropriate
for
a
courtroom
is
not
necessarily
inappropriate
because
it
would
prejudice
the--
trial;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that's
why
we
don't
allow
banners,
because
a
courtroom
is
not
the
place
for
banners.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
hadn't
said
that.
because
i
had
thought
that
one
of
the
things
that
made
this
case
leaning
in
your
direction
is
the
fact
that
merely
having
a
picture
of
their
loved
one
on
the
button
doesn't
convey
the
message,
you
know,
hang
the
defendant,
or
even
convict
the
defendant.
it
just
conveys,
at
most,
to
the
jury,
you
know,
this
is...
we
have
been
deprived
of
someone
we
love,
you
should
take
this
matter
very
seriously
and
consider
the
case
carefully.
it
is
an
important
matter
to
us.
and
therefore,
you
ought
to
deliberate
carefully.
i
don't
know
that
it
means
anything
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said,
you
know,
convict
what's...
or
hang
what's
his
name.
that's
quite...
you're
equating
that
with
the
buttons
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
the
buttons
in
this
case
say
hang
so
and
so,
or
even
convict
so
and
so.
they
just
say
we
have
been
deprived
of
a
loved
one.
this
is
a
terrible
matter.
please,
jury,
consider
this
case
carefully.
that's
all
it
necessarily
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
some
states
require
that
the
relatives
of
the
victim
be
allowed
to
make
their
case
to
the
jury
for
harsh
penalty.
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily
inappropriate
to
know
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
repeated
later
in
opinions
for
the
majority,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
later
cases,
so
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
just
put
it
in
brennan's
dissent.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem
when
you're
dealing
with
activities
of
people
other
than
the
prosecution,
people
other
than
the
state,
who
is
bringing
this
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
makes
it
a
different
case.
it
makes
it
very
hard
to
say,
well,
the
supreme
court's
already
decided
this
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
it
may
come
out
the
way...
it
may
come
out
the
way
you
want,
but
it's
hard
to
say
that
the
supreme
court,
any
supreme
court
case
bears
upon
it,
when
we
haven't
had
a
case
that
involves
weighing
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
people
in
the
courtroom
to
wear
buttons
or
cry
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
but
that
cuts
against
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume...
risk
of
what?
that's
what
i'm
puzzled
by.
let's
assume
that
the
buttons
were
big
enough
that
they
could
recognize
that
the
buttons
were
the
face
of
the
deceased
for
whose
murder
the
trial
was
about.
let's
assume
all
that.
what
risk
is
that?
you
know,
during
sentencing
i
can
understand,
oh,
he
caused
so
much
grief
to
so
many
people,
once
we
found
him
guilty,
we
should
sock
him
with
a
stiff
sentence.
but
during
the
guilt
trial?
i
mean,
i
see,
gee,
the
victim's
family
loved
him
a
lot.
this
guy
must
be
guilty.
that
doesn't
follow
at
all.
in
the
guilt
phase,
i
don't
see
how
that
can
have
any
effect
on
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
possibility.
you
tell
me
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
a
real
possibility
that
a
jury
is
going
to
say,
since
this
man's...
this
victim's
family
loved
him
so
much,
this
guy
must
be
guilty?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
because
we
haven't
had
a
first
amendment
case
yet.
i
mean,
we
just
have
parties
arguing
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
trial
for
the
defendant,
for
the
state.
let's
wait
until
the
aclu
brings
a
case
about
people
who
want
to
wear
buttons
in
court.
then
you're
going
to
have
people
arguing,
people
ought
to
be
able
to
wear
buttons,
just
as
they
can
wear
a
shirt
that
says
"blip
the
draft".
