justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
actually
saying
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
you
would
then
review
it
de
novo.
but
on
de
novo
review,
you
would
sustain
the
conviction
if
it
came
to
the
right
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not
affirm...
you
would
not
sustain
the
conviction
relying
on
aedpa.
you
would
say
aedpa
authorizes
review,
but
on
review,
we
conclude
the
conviction
was
correct.
that's
what
i
understand
the
hypothetical
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
we
all
thought
that
this
practice
in
this
particular
case
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
fair
trial,
but
we
also
agreed
with
you
that
aedpa
prevents
us
from
announcing
such
a
judgment.
what
if
we
wrote
an
opinion
saying
it
is
perfectly
clear
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
here,
but
congress
has
taken
away
our
power
to
reverse
it.
then
a
year
from
now,
the
same
case
arises.
could
we
follow...
could
the
district
court
follow
our
dicta
or
could
it...
would
it
be
constrained
to
say
we
don't
know
what
the
supreme
court
might
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
at
sentencing
after
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
i'm
not
sure
you're
right
that
nobody
was
concerned
about...
everybody
thought
the
factors
were
wrong.
i
don't
think
the
trial
judge
did.
the
trial
judge
said
he
saw
no
possibility
of
prejudice.
