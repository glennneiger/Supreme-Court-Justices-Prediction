roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
carey
versus
musladin.
mr.
ott.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
looking
under
aedpa
at
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
where
you
think
the
state
court
has
incorrectly
articulated
supreme
court
law,
but
nonetheless
reached
the
correct
result?
in
other
words,
correct
understanding
of
the
established
supreme
court
law
would
have
led
to
the
same
result
as
their
incorrect
articulation
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
my
hypothetical,
and
we'll
debate
later
whether
it
is
this
case
or
not,
is
let's
say
that
the
state
court
wrongly
articulates
supreme
court
law.
but
under
the
correct
articulation,
it
leads
to
the
same
result.
what
happens
in
that
case
under
aedpa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
misarticulated
them.
i
guess
the
question
of
application
is...
i
mean,
i
assumed
they
reached
what
we
would
regard
as
the
correct
result
under
the
correct
standard,
they
just
articulated
the
wrong
standard.
your
answer,
i
take
it,
is
that
it
would
then
be
reviewed
without
aedpa
deference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
need
to
establish
that
rule,
do
you?
you
just
need
to
establish
that
what
the
supreme
court
determined
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
different
is
it
from
the
victim's
family
sitting
in
the
second
row
behind
the
prosecution
every
day
of
the
trial?
and
i
mean,
i'm...
the
hypothetical
correctly
focuses
on
the
question,
at
least
for
me,
of
whether
or
not
you
can
have
specific
applications
of
general
rules
that
are
clearly
established.
i'm
just
not
sure
your
agreement
with
it
is
advisable
because
it
seems
to
me
that
simply
having...
how
many
people
have
to
wear
these
buttons?
one
person
shows
up
with
a
"hang
musladin"
button,
does
that
mean
it
is
a
mob-dominated
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ott.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fermino?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
your
point
about
the
state
court
focusing
on
norris.
the
question
under
aedpa
is
still
whether
or
not
it
is
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
wear
any
buttons?
it
says,
"fair
trial".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
most...
i
don't
think...
a
typical
jury
will
understand
that
the
victim
is
going
to
have
a
family,
and
they're
going
to
be
sorry
that
he's
dead,
and
they
might
be
there
at
his
trial.
and
they
may
not
like
the
person
accused
of
murdering
their
son.
that
is
not...
that
is
sort
of
like
in
every
case.
that's
not...
the
buttons
don't
seem
to
add
much
to
what
the
jury
will
derive
from
seeing
the
family
seated
behind
the
prosecution
bench.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
about...
what
if
the
issue
was
mourning?
the
trial
is
being
held
and
the
families
appear
and
they're
all
in
black
because
they're
still
in
mourning.
does
that
violate
this
clearly
established
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
my
question
is
under
aedpa,
if
the
state
court
said,
you
know,
i'm
not
going
to
keep
the
family
out
even
in
mourning,
that
would
violate
the
clearly
established
rule
that
you've
just
articulated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
want
to
put
your...
hang
your
hat
on
the
"contrary
to"
prong,
though,
do
you?
your
argument,
i
thought,
was
an
unreasonable
application
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
we've
never
even
had
a
case
involving
spectators.
so
it's
not
contrary
to
clearly
established
law.
we
have
cases
stating
the
general
principle
on
which
it
relies,
so
maybe
it's
an
unreasonable
application.
but
"contrary
to"
seems
an
awful
stretch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fermino.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
ott,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ott.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
in
05-785,
carey
v.
musladin.
