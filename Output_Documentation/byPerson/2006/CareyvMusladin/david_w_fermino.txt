mr.
david
w.
fermino
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
direct
this
court's
attention
to
the
state
court
opinion
which
appears
at
55a
to
78a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
i
want
your
honors
to
take
a
look
at
that
opinion.
it
is
25
pages
in
length,
but
the
portion
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
buttons
issue
is
two
pages
in
length.
of
those
two
pages,
all
but
a
few
sentences
deal
directly
with
the
norris
case.
i
believe
it
is
at
roughly
page
72a
in
their...
73a
of
the
appendix.
all
but
three
sentences
deal
with
the
norris
case.
the
attorney
general
has
said
in
its
briefing
that
the
court
below
teased
out
the
particular
reference
to
the
buttons,
that
it
carefully
parsed
the
opinion,
that
it
gave
a
tendentious
analysis.
this
is
the
description
of
the
attorney
general.
nothing
could
be
further
from
accuracy.
these
two
pages
discuss
norris
head
on.
it
is
the
elephant
in
the
room,
if
you
will.
the
court
below
could
not
have...
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
court
below
to
write
this
opinion
without
addressing
the
norris
case
head
on.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
court...
it
is
correct
that
the
record
before
the
state
court
of
appeals
was
inadequate
to
address...
to
answer
the
question.
but
i
think
what...
where
the
court
erred
is
in
adding
and
grafting
on
an
additional
element.
it
goes
beyond
that
sentence
that,
justice
breyer,
you
focused
on.
i
think
it
is
that
the...
it
is
the
element
of
branding.
it's
that
this
wearing
of
the
buttons
in
a
sense
branded
the
defendant
in
the
eyes
of
the
jurors.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that's
correct.
but
i
believe
that
it
is
not
part
of
the
test.
it
was
that
the
branding
language,
as
in
justice
brennan's...
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
was
not
part
of
the
text
articulated
by--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
well,
in
this
instance,
much
has
been
said
about
the
opinion
and
the
carefully
written
opinion
of
the
state
court.
but
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
focuses
on
this
issue
is,
as
i
said,
roughly
two
pages
in
length
and
deals
almost
entirely
with
norris.
norris
was
the
contrast
case
for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
that
the...
were
this
discussion
of
norris
to
be
a
much
longer
discussion...
or
excuse
me,
part
of
a
much
longer
discussion,
that
might
be
true.
but
its
entire
focus
was
norris.
it
used
norris
by
way
of
negative
explication
to
show
that
the
facts
before
it
didn't
fall
within
the
rule
as
derived
from
williams
and
flynn.
and
i
think
that
goes
beyond
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
it
took
the
case,
it
grappled
with
it,
it
decided
that
it
was
different
than
norris.
and
i
think
that
there
would
have
been
no
way
for
the
court
below
to
have
looked
at
the
facts
of
this
case
without
addressing
norris--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--well,
justice
breyer,
that
is
certainly
a
plausible
reading
of
the
state
court
opinion.
however,
i
think
you've
also
identified
one...
the
problem
with
this.
it
is
the
risk,
not
the
reality.
and
that's
why
we
have
to
look
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case
and
look
to
the
rule
as
derived
from
the
williams
and
flynn
case,
as
i
think
the
court
below
properly
did.
and
in
doing
so,
in
applying
it
to
this
case,
i
think
you
have
to
do
away
with
this
kind
of
courtroom
behavior.
it
is
simply
not
acceptable.
it
is
not
acceptable
to
wear--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--any
courtroom
practice
that
causes
an
impermissible
risk
that
the
jury's...
that
the
jury
would
come
to
a
conclusion
based
on
a
factor
not
introduced
at
trial
is
entirely
prejudicial--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--i
agree
with
mr.
chief
justice
up
unto
the
point
of
it's
not
different
wearing
the
buttons.
i
think
that
you
add
the
buttons,
and
you
are
creating...
you
are
doing
essentially
what
the
rule
derived
from
both
williams
and
flynn
teaches
us
is
wrong.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
there
isn't
a
case
that
is,
that...
where
the
state
action
element,
if
you
will,
is
not
present.
however,
i
would
posit
that
in
this
case,
where
you
have
a
judge,
a
trial
judge
who
denies
a
lawyer's
motion,
that
you
have
implicit
in
that
state
action,
that
the
court
has
endorsed
the
practice
of--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
justice--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--it...
and
it
might.
but
that
kind
of
behavior
by
a
courtroom
spectator
can
be
controlled
by
a
trial
judge
if...
when
it
occurs.
if
it
is
spontaneous,
it
can
be
controlled.
a
rule
that
spectators
aren't
allowed
to
emote
would
be
implausible,
or
would
be
impractical.
we
are
not
talking
here
today
about
controlling
the
emotions
of
spectators.
we
are
talking
about
an
impermissible
factor
like
a
message
or
the
risk
of
a
message.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
issue
here.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
well,
in
the
first
amendment
context,
though,
there's
a
balancing
test
that
needs
to
be
employed,
and
it--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--i
believe
that
mr.
cohen
in
new
hampshire
wearing
his
sign
regarding
the
draft--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--i
understand
that,
but--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
rule
derived
from
the
williams
and
flynn
cases
is
that
courtroom...
courtroom
behavior
that
creates
an
unacceptable
risk
that
impermissible
factors
have...
or
have
caused
a
jury's
verdict
to
be
based
not
solely
on
evidence
introduced
at
trial
is
inherently
prejudicial.
and
unless
it
advances
some
important
state
interest,
some
compelling
state
interest
like
the
concern
that
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
raised
about
the
forcing
a
defendant
to
appear
in
prison
garb
or
the
shackling
cases,
that
rule
i
think
allows
the
opinion
in
this
case
of
the
court
below
to
not
violate
the
prescriptions
of
the
aedpa.
i
think
that's
clear.
i
think
what
the
court
below
did
was
essentially
apply
the
rule
that
i
just
discussed.
and
i
think--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--i
think
you're
getting...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
hypothetical
gets
closer
to
it
as
well.
i
think
a
defendant's...
excuse
me,
a
victim's
family
wearing,
appearing
in
court
every
day
wearing
black
gets
closer
to
the
kind
of
message
import...
again,
the
risk,
not
the
reality...
that
this
case
is...
that
the
court
below
was
concerned
with.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
yes.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
think
it
is
a
factor
to
consider
in
the
court's
analysis.
however,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
unique
precisely
because
this
typically
doesn't...
we
don't
get
this
far
because
most
trial
judges
don't
allow
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
because
i
think
that
under...
i
think
that
this
court
looking
at
the
"contrary
to"
prong
of
the
analysis
would...
can
come
to
a
conclusion
that
the
state
court's
decision
wasn't...
i'm
getting
ahead
of
myself.
i
think
the
court
can
properly,
in
looking
at
it
from
a
"contrary
to"
analysis,
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
even
with
that
body
of
case
law,
that
the
state
court
got
it
wrong,
that
it
misapplied
the
clearly
established
law
of
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
think
it's
both,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
both.
i
think...
i
don't
need
to
hang
my
hat
on
the
"contrary
to"
because
i
think
under
either
prong--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--i
wouldn't
go...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
"an
awful
stretch",
but
i
would
think
that
we,
under
the
unreasonable
application
prong,
we
certainly
win.
i
think
that
there
is
also
an
argument
under
the
"contrary
to".
mr.
david
w.
fermino
it
is
not.
it
is
not
clear
at
all
from
the
record
how
many
days.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
it
may
have
been.
but
according
to
the
declarations
that
were
submitted
in
the
petition
for
collateral
review,
those
are
petitions...
those
are
declarations
of
the
trial
counsel
and
of
respondent's
mother...
it
is
that
they
were
worn
on
multiple
days
by
several
members
of
the
family,
and
that
the
buttons
were
anywhere
from
two
to
four
inches
in
diameter.
and
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
those
declarations
appear--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--they
were
filed
actually
as
part
of
the
state
collateral
review
proceedings.
they
were
filed
with
the
habeas.
and
it
appears
that
they
are
at
the
ja
6
and
8.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
if
i
did...
i'm
sorry,
that
question--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--no,
justice
alito,
if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke.
i
was
trying
to
say
that
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
the
frequency.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
correct.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
they
were
never
admonished
not
to
wear
them,
but
that
the
original
ruling
of
the
trial
judge
stood
as
far
as
the
wearing
of
the
buttons
was
concerned.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
justice
alito,
i
do,
as
far
as
it
goes,
accept
that
as
a
baseline.
i
think
judge
bea
in
a
separate
dissent
likened
it
to
a
family
wedding,
that
we
all
know
who
is
here
for
which
party.
that
we
have
no
quarrel
with.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
think
in
looking
at
the
rule
again
derived
from
williams
and
flynn,
we
don't
have
to
go
there.
it's
the
risk,
not
the
reality.
i
don't
know
what
could
be
inferred,
and
we
don't
know
what
was
in
the
jurors'
minds
as
they
saw
those
buttons.
but
the
point
is
that
it
could
affect
the
outcome.
it
is
an
impermissible
factor
that
causes
the
possibility
that
the
jurors'
verdict
is
based
on
something
other
than
the
evidence.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
because
you
can
imagine
as
a
juror...
jurors
are
very
attentive
during
trials...
that
they
look
out
into
the
audience
and
see
in
the
jury
box...
i
mean,
out
in
the
audience,
a
group
of
people
wearing
buttons.
what
are
those
buttons?
what's
on
there?
what's
the
point
of...
there's
a
degree
of
scrutiny
that's
naturally
going
to
occur
by
an
attentive
juror.
that's
really
the
issue.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
a
risk
of
a
factor
that
is
not
subjected
to
adversarial
testing.
it
is
the
possibility
that
it
could
have
an
impact.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
here
you
have--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--but
that's
only
one
possible
message
of
this
button.
and
again,
that's
where
i'm
contrasting
the
risk
versus
the
reality.
it's
that
it
could
be
any
message
that's
sent.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
i
do
accept
that,
and
i
don't
need
to
rely
on
a
message.
i
would
agree
with
the
argument
that
you've
advanced.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
the...
i
think
it
is
important
here
to
look
at
the
fact
that
no
party
in
this
case...
that
the
state
has
not
advanced
that
this
is
a
practice
that
should
be
endorsed
or
adopted.
it
is
clear
that
everyone
involved
has
had
a
concern
with
the
wearing
of
buttons
or
any
other
kind
of
introduction
into
the
proceeding
that
would
otherwise
not
be
subject
to
meaningful
adversarial
testing,
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
and
i
do
believe
if
you
look
closely
at
the
state
court
opinion
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
the
court
below's
opinion
was
correct,
that
they
did
not
tease
out
of
the
opinion
or
parse
or
apply
any
kind
of
tendentious
reading,
when
you
look
at
exactly
what
the
state
court
decided.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
but
this
court,
i
think,
could
craft
an
opinion
that
addresses
that
concern
without
the
need
for
simply
awaiting
that
day.
mr.
david
w.
fermino
and
i
misspoke.
you're
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
trial
judge
did
reach
that
conclusion.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would--
mr.
david
w.
fermino
--thank
you.
