justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
case
a,
and
it
said,
we
interpret
the
supreme
court
rule
to
be
as
follows,
it
could
then
later
say
in
case
b,
this
is
how
we've
interpreted
the
supreme
court
rule,
and
we're
bound
by
case
a.
this
is
the
elaboration
we've
given
to
it.
and
we
have
to
find
that
the
state
court,
of
course,
isn't
bound
by
what
we
do,
but
we're
bound
by
what
we
do
when
we
review
what
the
state
court
has
decided.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
all
of
the...
suppose
there
are
five
circuits.
they're
the
only
ones
that
looked
at
the
issue.
and
they
all
say,
we
think
the
general
rule
of
the
supreme
court
is
as
follows,
isn't
that
entitled
to
some
weight?
you're
not
supposed
to
cite
that
when
you
go
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
or
you
go
to
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us...
let's
assume
for
a
minute
that
this
case
were
on
direct
review,
that
we
don't
have
aedpa.
what
is
the
standard
that
should
control?
whether
there
is
an
impermissible...
an
unacceptable
risk
that
impermissible
factors
will
be
taken
into
account
by
the
jury?
is
that
the
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
should
make
it
more
specific
for
us.
you
say
general
due
process.
how
does
that
work
in
this
case?
i
want
to
know
whether
or
not
i
can
order
or
must
order
someone
to
remove
a
sign,
a
button,
a
piece
of
clothing.
what's
the
test
that
i
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
unless
you
want
to
go
on,
that
doesn't
help
me.
we
just
tell
all
the
judges
in
the
country
to
assess
all
the
circumstances,
we
say
no
more?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
banners?
what
would
you
do
with
banners?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
do
with
banners?
would
it
make
sense
to
say
all
banners
are
banned
from
the
courtroom?
i
thought
you
would
think
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
signs,
placards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
i
know
why.
because
it
affects
the
atmospherics
of
the
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
so
sure.
you
think
that
we
could
just
say
we're
going
to
exercise
our
best
judgment,
not
necessarily
amend
the
constitution,
just
because
it
is
a
good
idea,
banners
and
buttons
are
hereby
banned
forever?
do
we
have
the
authority
to
just
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
exploring
initially
what
the
rule
ought
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
falls
within
the
ambit
of
what?
of
a
mob-dominated
atmosphere
or...
your
answer
to
justice
souter
was
aedpa
would...
was
that
this
would
require
reversal
even
under
aedpa;
is
that
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
quoting
holbrook
and
flynn.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
and
you're
having
the
judge
say
that
you
can't
wear
certain
signs,
you
can't
make
certain
demonstrations.
if
the
family
were
there
and
they...
and
one
of
the
members
of
the
family
was
sobbing,
with
tears
coming
out
of
her
eyes,
i...
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--much,
it
has
much
more
impact
than
a
button.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
record
is
confusing,
at
least
as
i
read
it...
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
on
the
showing
of
how
many
days
these
buttons
were
worn.
a,
is
it
clear
from
the
record
how
many
days
the
buttons
were
worn?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
may
have
been
for
just
one
day
of
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
were
declarations
filed
with
the
united
states
district
court
in
habeas?
