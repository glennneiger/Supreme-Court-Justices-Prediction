justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
for
killing
a
man
outside
the
home
of
his
estranged
wife.
at
respondent’s
trial
several
members
of
the
victim’s
family
sat
on
the
front
row
of
the
spectators
gallery
wearing
buttons
with
the
photo
of
the
victim
on
them.
respondent
asked
to
have
the
family
members
remove
the
buttons
but
the
california
trial
court
denied
his
request.
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed
respondent’s
conviction.
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
granted
habeas
corpus
relief
concluding
that
the
california
appellate
court’s
denial
of
his
request
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
federal
courts
may
not
grant
habeas
corpus
unless
the
relevant
state
court
decision
is
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
this
court.
in
the
estelle
v.
williams
and
holbrook
v.
flynn
this
court
address
claims
that
state
sponsored
courtroom
practice
has
violated
defendant’s
fair-trial
rights.
but
we
have
never
addressed
a
claim
like
this
one
in
which
it
is
alleged
that
private-actor
courtroom
conduct
was
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
it
deprived
a
defendant
of
a
fair-trial.
reflecting
the
lack
of
guidance
from
this
court,
state
courts,
and
lower
federal
courts,
have
taken
widely
varying
in
considering
claims
of
inherent
prejudice
resulting
from
private-actor
courtroom
conduct.
we
go
to
great
link
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
the
case
involving
situation
in
which
the
trial
is
overwhelmed
by
mob
rule
or
mob
activity
and
court
has
dealt
with
that
in
the
past.
given
the
lack
of
holding
from
this
court
regarding
the
potentially
prejudicial
effect
of
spectator’s
courtroom
conduct
of
the
kind
involved
here
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
california
appellate
court
unreasonably
applied
clearly
established
federal
law.
justices
stevens,
kennedy
and
souter
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
