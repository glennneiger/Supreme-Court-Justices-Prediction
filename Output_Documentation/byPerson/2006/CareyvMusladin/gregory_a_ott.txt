mr.
gregory
a.
ott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
constitutionality
of
photo
buttons
worn
by
spectators
during
a
criminal
trial.
the
two
closest
decisions
of
this
court,
estelle
v.
williams
and
holbrook
v.
flynn
established
only
a
general
rule
that
some
courtroom
practices
may
be
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
they
violate
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
neither
flynn
nor
williams--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--an
unacceptable
risk,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
well,
the
test
has
been
formulated
different
ways--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--in
flynn,
it
did,
but
it
also,
just
a
paragraph
or
so
earlier
said
that
the
only
question
we
need
to
answer
is
whether
this
practice,
and
there
the
courtroom
uniformed
guards,
is
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
it
violates
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
we
don't
believe
that
those
are
material--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--that
certainly
was
a
formulation
of
the
test.
it's
been...
we
can
accept
it
as
the
formulation
of
the
test.
and
it
was
accepted
by
the
california
courts
below.
they
attempted
to
apply
that
test.
they
announced
the
proper...
the
correct
clearly
established
law
of
this
court,
and
then
proceeded
to
analyze
the
issue.
below,
however,
on
federal
habeas
review,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
used
its
own
circuit
case
to
define
clearly
established
law
under
aedpa.
instead
of
assessing
the
state
court's
application
of
the
general
rule,
the
circuit
court
narrowed
this
court's
general
rule
into
one
that
specifically
condemned
buttons.
instead
of
granting
the
state
court
wide
leeway
to
apply
this
court's
general
rule,
it...
the
circuit
court
created
a
narrow
rule
that
would
seemingly
prohibit
buttons
in
any
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
well,
your
honor
makes
a
distinction
between
a
post-aedpa
case
and
pre-aedpa
cases.
in
a
post-aedpa
setting,
it
is...
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
looking
at
its
own
post-aedpa
case...
post
a-e-d-p-a,
aedpa
case
which
has
said
that
this
set
of
facts
constitutes
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law.
we
don't
disagree
that
stare
decisis
might
come
into
play
there.
it
doesn't
mean
that
that
first
decision
was
correct,
but
we
don't...
what
happened
here
in
contrast
was
a
pre-aedpa
decision
that
was
used
to
define
the
clearly
established
law
of
this
court,
give
it
more
detail
such
that
the
circumstances
here
fell
outside
of
it.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
not
by
doing
that.
however,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
here
expressly
stated
it
was
looking
to
its
own
circuit
authority
to
define
the
law
that
is
clearly
established.
it
specifically
stated
that
this
case,
that
the
state's
decision
was
unreasonable
in
light
of
norris.
it
specifically
stated
that
the
state
court's
decision
could
not
reasonably
be
distinguished
from
norris.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
mr.
chief
justice,
at
first,
the...
the
first
thing
to
do
would
be
to
look
at
the
fair
import,
as
this
court
stated
in
wilford
v.
biscotti.
look
at
the
fair
import
of
the
decision.
now,
i
don't
know
if
you
are
referring
to
the
issue
about
the
arguable
misarticulation
of
the
text
at
the
end
of
the
state
court's
decision
here,
but
the
first
question
is
to
look
at
the
fair
import.
and
if
the
fair
import
is
that
the
correct
test
was
applied,
then
habeas
relief
does
not
lie.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
i
believe
that
the
habeas
relief
should
not
lie.
now,
i
have
seen
circuit
courts
treat
it
different
ways.
some
courts
will
decline
to
give
deference
and
review
it
de
novo,
but
i
don't
think
congress
intended,
in
enacting
aedpa,
the
a-e-d-p-a,
that
a
state
habeas...
a
state
conviction
should
be
overturned
simply
because
of
an
accident
in
a
statement
or
formulation
of
the
test,
but
the
conviction
is
otherwise
constitutionally
balanced--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--yes.
i
believe
so.
if
i
understood
you
correctly...
the
question
correctly,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
yes,
with
the
caveat
that
we're
assuming
that
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
state
court
has
misapplied,
that
the
fair
import
has...
they
have
misapplied
the
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
no,
your
honor.
then
i
misunderstood
the
question.
the
deference
would
still
apply
if
you
could
look
at
the
decision
as
a
whole
and
see
that
the
correct
standard
was
applied.
if
they
have
erroneously
stated
the
standard...
if
the
state
court
erroneously
stated
the
standard,
but
you
can
look
to
the
decision
as
a
whole,
and
see
that
the
correct
standard
was
nevertheless
applied,
deference
is
still
due.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
no,
your
honor.
we...
our
position
is
that
a
federal
habeas
court
may
not
look
at
all
to
state
or
circuit
authority
on
the
question
of
what
is
clearly
established,
only
the
holdings
of
this
court,
and
what
appears
on
their
face.
if
there's
a
general
rule,
such
as
here,
the
question
moves
to
the
reasonable
application
prong.
and
under
that
prong,
because
the
rule
is
general,
as
this
court
stated
in
yarborough
versus
alvarado,
the
more
general
the
rule,
the
more
leeway
there
is.
relief
can
still
lie
under
certain
circumstances,
but
it's...
it
moves
into
a
question
of
objective
reasonableness
of
the
state
court's
decision.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
if
your
honor
is
speaking
only
to
the
clearly
established
prong,
my
answer
would
be
no.
if
a
circuit
court
says
jackson
v.
virginia
is
clearly
established
law
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
we
have
no
dispute
with
that.
but
to
redefine
or
shape
this
court's
holdings
beyond
the
face
of
those
holdings,
our
position
is
that
cannot
be
done
with
state
or
circuit
law.
circuit
law
and
state
law
may
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
reasonable
application,
but
not
on
the
first
prong.
if
a
federal
habeas
court
looks
to
circuit
or
state
authority
on
the
first
prong
of
2254(d)(1),
the
reasonableness
becomes
a
foregone
conclusion.
the
two...
the
two
sections
of
the
statute
collapse
into
what
is
essentially
de
novo
review,
as
what
happened
here.
once,
for
instance,
the
habeas
court
here
decided
that
its
own
circuit
authority
required...
or
prohibited
buttons,
reasonableness
was
a
foregone
conclusion,
even
though
it
was
addressed
by
the
circuit.
but
in
further
response
to
your
question,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
on
the
reasonable
application
prong,
a
federal
habeas
court
may
look
to
state
and
circuit
cases.
they
are
of
varying
relevance,
but
they
should
look
to
state
and
federal
circuit
cases
equally,
but
not
all
those
cases
have
the
same
relevance.
we
have...
there
is
a
distinction
between
pre-aedpa
and
post-aedpa
cases,
and
the
distinction
between
whether
those
cases
support
or
contradict
the
state
court's
opinion.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
there
would
be
a
difference,
your
honor.
the...
depending
on
the
prong
we're
looking
at,
under...
our
argument
would
still
be
the
same
under...
on
the
clearly
established
prong
of
2254(d)(1),
that
even
if
norris
was
a
post-aedpa
case,
that
the
circuit
court
could
not
look
to
norris
to
define
this
court's
holdings.
but
norris,
if
it
were
a
post-aedpa
case
would
have
more
relevance
on
the
reasonable
application
prong.
there,
stare
decisis
might
come
into
play.
it
doesn't
mean
norris
is
correct.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
result
reached
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
would
be
correct,
but
it
would
certainly
be
more
relevant.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
that
is
a
test,
the
test,
one
of
the
formulations
of
it.
i
don't
believe
it
materially
differs
from...
our
position
is
it
doesn't
materially
differ
from
the
general
due
process,
fair
trial
standard
that
applies
in
all
cases.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
your
honor,
it
is
an
assessment
of
all
the
circumstances,
that
if
you're
a
trial
judge--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--no,
your
honor.
let's
take
the
impermissible
factor
test.
the
state
court
judge
should
look
at
the
circumstances
before
him
and
determine
whether
he
believes
that
there
is
an
unacceptable
risk
of
impermissible
factors
coming
into
play.
whether
the
practice
at
issue,
whether
it
be
buttons
or
ribbons
or
what
have
you,
is
so
likely
to
prejudice
this
defendant
or
violate
or
infringe
on
his
fundamental
rights
that
we
need
to
order
them
removed.
not
just
as
a
matter
of
supervisory
power,
but
as
a
constitutional
requirement.
so
it
is
a
spectrum
test,
your
honor.
and
it's
essentially
a
totality
test
of
the
circumstances
of
the
buttons,
let's
say,
and
there
can't
be
a
bright
line
rule.
the
circumstances--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--your
honor,
my
answer
is
no.
as
a
supervisory
matter,
a
state
court
can
do
whatever
it
wishes.
under
the
state
constitution,
state
statutes,
state
rules
of
court,
can
do
many
things
under
its
supervisory
power
or
even
state
constitutional
power.
that
is
different
altogether,
however,
from
saying
that
all
buttons
violate
the
constitution,
which
is
different
in
turn
from
saying
all
buttons
require
habeas
relief.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
banners?
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
your
honor,
i
haven't
seen
a
case
involving
banners.
i
imagine
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--and
likewise,
we
don't
see
all
the
button
cases
where
the
buttons
have
been
precluded.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
decorum
should
not
be
confused
with--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--i
understand,
your
honor.
and
this
court
obviously
has
the
power
to
enact
a
prophylactic
rule
that...
but
a
prophylactic
rule
covers
many
unconstitutional
as
well
as
constitutional
practices.
and
that
a
prophylactic
rule
requires...
the
prophylactic
rule
that
might
be
enacted
would
require
preclusion
of
buttons
does
not
mean
that
all
the
buttons
that
might
come
up
are
necessarily
prejudicial.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
this
case
has...
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
application
of
the
aedpa.
so
we
are
not
asking...
certainly
not
asking
for
that.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
it
could
not
follow
this
court's
dicta
under
this
court's
statement
in
williams
v.
taylor
that
only
the
holdings,
not
the
dicta,
of
this
court
establish
clearly...
clearly
establish
supreme
court
authority.
i
believe
that
the
rule,
if
there's
going
to
be
one,
should
be
the
rule
that
was
applied
here.
a
general
rule
of
fundamental
fairness
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
before
the
trial
court.
i
think
the
rule
works.
and
it
worked
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
asking
for
a
new
rule
applicable
to
buttons.
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
of
the
circuit
court's
method
in
addressing
this
case
and
granting
habeas
relief.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
change
the
clearly
established
prong.
we
still
have
the
general
rule,
but
i
think
that
your
instance
is
one
that
all
judges
would
agree
is
so
egregious
that
it
falls
within
the
ambit
of
that,
and
would
require
habeas
relief.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
i
can
concede
that,
yes,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--well,
the
question
is
objective
reasonableness.
and
we
don't
dispute
that
some
circumstances
may
present
such
a
situation
that
no
one,
no
judge
is
going
to
disagree
that
the
situation,
at
the
state
court,
if
it
denied
the
relief
on
the
three
buttons
you
posed
was
unreasonable.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
the
"hang
musladin"
button,
the
impermissible
factor
first
is
the
explicit
message.
"hang
musladin".
"convict
him".
it's
urging
the
jury
to
convict
him
and
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--it
is
an
outside
influence,
your
honor.
it
is
an
influence
coming
from--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--no,
your
honor.
my...
what
i...
the
point
i
meant
to
make
was
that
we're
not
urging
that
relief
can
never
lie
because
there's
a
general
rule
of
application.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
it's
a
spectrum.
and
i
would...
i'm
not
conceding
that
the
example
necessarily
requires
habeas
relief,
because
there
are
a
whole
host
of
circumstances
that
we
wouldn't
know
about
it,
for
instance,
whether
it
was
ever
seen,
in
cases
that
people
don't
see
the
button,
or
what
have
you.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
i
don't
think
it
would
be
required.
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say
that
habeas
relief
must
lie.
there
are
many...
there
are
much
fewer
inferences
that
could
be
drawn
there.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
it...
there
are--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--well,
as
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out,
three
family
members
of
the
victim
sitting
in
the
front
row,
buttons
or
not,
the
buttons
don't
add...
add
little,
if
anything,
to
the
three
victim's
family
members
sitting
there
grieving
through
a
trial.
they
add
very
little,
for
instance,
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
sentiment
is
obvious
to
the
jury.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
i
would
submit
that
that
sentiment
is
obvious
to
the
jury,
that
a
juror--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--your
honor,
i
did
not
intend
at
all
to
suggest
that
that
was
a
message
from
those
buttons.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
the
buttons
add
very
little.
because
i
think
a
juror
understands
what
a--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--that's,
if
any
message,
what
the
buttons
conveyed
in
this
case.
i
was
only
speaking
to
the
difference
between
the
buttons
that
justice
souter
posed
as
putting
forth
a
more
explicit
message.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
because
in
your
case,
i
don't
think
that
that
message
necessarily...
i
think
it
is
reasonable
for
a
state
court
to
conclude
that
those
buttons
did
not
add
much
to,
if
anything,
to
the
presence
of--
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
--your
honor,
we
could
concede
that
for
this
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
at
the
guilt
stage,
that's
right.
california
statutes
do
require
that
victims'
families
be
able
to
make
a
statement
at
sentencing.
they
also
require
that
the
victim's
family,
if
the
victim
is
not
alive,
be
present
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial,
during
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
your
honor,
your...
your
buttons
might
raise
an
impermissible
risk.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
they
do,
but
it
might
still
be
reasonable
for
a
state
court
to
conclude
otherwise.
and
it
was
certainly
reasonable
for
the
state
court
here
to
conclude
that
three
simple
buttons
bearing
only
a
photo
did
not
convey
any
message
of
blame,
guilt,
anything
other
than
grief
of
this
family.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
thank
you.
mr.
gregory
a.
ott
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
submit
this
matter.
