justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
don't
agree
with
the
argument
that
we've
heard
this
morning
that
the
transformation
of
american
retailing
since
the
1970s
and
the
rise
of
the
large-scale
low-price
retailers
has
anything
to
do
with
the
end
of
the
fair
trade
laws
and
that
overruling
dr.
miles
would
reverse
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
the
large-scale
low-price
retailers
who
were
supposedly
dependent
on
dr.
miles
are...
support
its
retention?
have
they
filed
amicus
briefs
here
or
otherwise
suggested
that
this
is
essential
to
their
continuing
operation?
