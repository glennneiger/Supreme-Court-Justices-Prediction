there
was
an
argument
made,
mr.
olson,
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
distinguish
vertical
from
horizontal
in
this
context,
that
in
fact,
the
agreement
that
the
manufacturer
made
with
the
dealers
was
more
successful
in
getting
a
horizontal
accord
among
the
dealers
than
if
the
dealers
had
attempted
it
themselves,
in
which
case
some
might
have
held
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
not
so
long
ago
that
the
department
of
justice
took
a
different
view.
and
of
all
of
the
vertical
restraints,
this
is
the
only
one
where
congress
has
been
a
player.
i
mean,
congress
allowed
the
fair
trade
laws
to
operate.
and
then
it
withdrew
that.
there's
no
other
restraint
where
they
are
has
been
congressional
action,
where
the
argument
could
be
made,
well,
congress
is
well
aware
of
this,
the
court
should
allow
them
to
make
the
change,
if
they
so
will.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
those
cases
you
didn't
have
the
counterpart
to
miller-tydings
and
mcguire.
that's
what
makes
this...
this
one
different
in
terms
of
congressional
intention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
before
you
sit
down,
there's
just
one
thing
that
wasn't
covered
in
your
argument
or
in
the
brief,
but
the
complaint
alleged
in
this
case
that
leegin
allowed
certain
favored
dealers
to
discount;
not
this
plaintiff,
but
others
were
allowed
to
discount.
and
if
that
were
true,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
then
that
would
be
a...
a
plain
violation
of
antitrust
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
complaint,.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
rule
of
reason
is
the
one
that
applies,
i
gathered,
perhaps
incorrectly,
from
mr.
olson's
remarks
that
this
would
be...
this
case
would
be
thrown
out
on
summary
judgment,
it
would
never
get
to
trial.
how
do
you
think
the
rule
of
reason
would
operate
if
it
were
the
rubric
under
which
this
case
were
to
be
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
the
formula,
but
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
and
mr.
olson
said
that
the
plaintiff
could
never
get
across
the
first
threshold?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case,
this
case
has
none
of
those
features.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
leegin
loses
under
the
rule
of
reason,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
with
the
tremendous
anomaly
that
the
employer...
that
the...
the
manufacturer
cannot
do
this
by
agreement,
but
he
can
do
it
just
unilaterally
and
terminate
any
dealers
that
won't
go
along?
those
two
sit
uncomfortably
with
each
other.
colgate
seems
to
say
you
can
achieve
the
same
end
but
we're
not
going
to
let
you
do
it
by
agreement,
you
have
to
do
it
on
your
own,
and
then
you
have
to
do
the
draconian
thing
of
terminating
the
dealer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coykendall,
the...
on
the
question...
you
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
some
discounting
allowed
by,
how
do
you
pronounce
it,
leegin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
leegin.
and
mr.
olson
says
that
that
wasn't
pursued
at
trial;
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
were
to
lose,
you
would
still
have
that
claim,
i
take
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
mr.
olson
pointed
out,
under
the
fair
trade
laws
this
was
per
se
legal.
so
that's
kind
of
a
different
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
on
the
year
by
year,
don't
spend
any
money
on,
maybe
congress
decided
that
wasn't
an
appropriate
technique,
but
congress
has
used
that
after,
hasn't
it,
in
other
cases?
