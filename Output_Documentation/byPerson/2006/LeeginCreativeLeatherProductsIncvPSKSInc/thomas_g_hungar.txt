mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
same
considerations
that
led
this
court
in
sylvania
and
state
oil
to
reject
outmoded
per
se
rules
compel
that
same
result
here.
the
dr.
miles
rule
conflicts
with
this
court's
modern
antitrust
jurisprudence
in
three
fatal--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--several
reasons,
your
honor.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
close
question
whether
this
court
under
its
modern
antitrust
jurisprudence
as
an
initial
matter
would
impose
a
per
se
rule
in
this
context.
there
is
economic...
there
is
consensus
among
the
respected
economists--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
think
you,
your
honor.
given
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--given
that
this
court's
test,
the
question
this
court's
modern
cases
ask,
in
distinguishing
between
the
rule
of
reason
and
the
per
se
rule,
is
whether
the
challenged
conduct
is
always
or
almost
always
anticompetitive.
that's
what
the
court
has
said.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
certainly
not,
your
honor.
because
that,
that
is
almost
always
anticompetitive
in
our
experience
and
in
the
experience
of
the
courts.
but
the
same
is
not
true
in
the
resale
price
maintenance
context.
dr.
miles
has
foreclosed
the
courts
from
conducting
the
kind
of
analysis
that
would
actually
look
into
this
question.
but
the
empirical
data
that
are
available
would
suggest
that
anticompetitive
explanations
for
resale
price
maintenance
do
not
have
very
much
explanatory
power.
when
you
actually
look
at
the
cases
that
have
been
litigated,
they
involve
manufacturers
without
market
power,
unconcentrated
markets,
no
evidence
in
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases
of
any
cartelization
going
on.
so
the
anticompetitive
explanations,
while
certainly
valid
in
some
cases,
do
not
appear
to
explain
most
of
the
resale
price
maintenance
that
has
been
litigated.
it's
true
that
resale
price
maintenance
can
but
does
not
always
result
in
price
increases,
but,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
price
is
not
the
only
thing
that
consumers
care
about.
and
there
is
widespread
consensus
in
the
economic
literature
and
in
this
court's
recent
cases
that
price-based
vertical
restraints,
just
like
non-price
based
vertical
restraints,
while
they
generally
reduce
intrabrand
competition,
generally
enhance
interbrand
competition.
in
monsanto
and
business
electronics,
this
court
made
clear
that
price
vertical
restraints,
like
minimum
resale
price
maintenance,
frequently,
in
fact
usually,
have
the
same
or
similar
effects
to
the
non-price
vertical
restraints
to
which
this
court
now
applies
rule
of
reason
analysis.
so
the
reason
in--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
because
horizontal...
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
incentive
of
the
manufacturer
when
the
manufacturer--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
the
reason
why
we
know
that
is
always
or
almost
always
harmful
is
that
the
incentive
at
a
horizontal
level
of
a
retailer
cartel,
just
like
the
incentives
of
the
participants
in
a
manufacturing
cartel--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
manufacturer's
incentive
is
not
to
increase
the
profits
of
the
retailers,
but
the
retailers
when
they
get
together
obviously
have
a
very
different
incentive,
which
is
not
to
benefit
the
manufacturer.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
in
state
oil
the
same
argument
was
made.
the
argument
was
made
that,
while
we
don't
have
compelling
empirical
evidence
that
albrecht
results
in
harm
to
the
economy,
we
don't
have
compelling
empirical
evidence
that
resale
price
maintenance,
maximum
resale
price
maintenance,
is
generally
pro-competitive,
and
in
the
absence
of
such
empirical
evidence
there's
no
basis
for
overturning
precedent.
this
court
unanimously--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--this
court...
i'm
sorry.
there's
no
empirical
evidence
that
i'm
aware
of
about
what
impact
eliminating
dr.
miles
would
have
on
the
wal-marts
of
the
world.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
mr.
olson
pointed
out,
the
k-marts
of
the
world
began
during
the
fair
trade
era.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
considerations
likes
the
opening
up
of
international
trade
and
the
development
of
markets
like
china
to
supply
low-cost
goods
have
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
success
of
the
wal-marts
of
the
world
than
a
rule
like
dr.
miles.
remember,
it's
perfectly
legal
under
current
law
for
manufacturers
to
impose
the
same
sort
of
constraints
as
long
as
they
do
it
by
fiat
and
unilateral
enforcement
rather
than
by
agreement.
so
the
suggestion
that
somehow
this
is
going
to
revolutionize
the
economy
if
dr.
miles
is
overruled
is
simply
unsupportable.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
as
the
ping
amicus
brief,
the
ping
golf
club
manufacturer
amicus
brief,
indicates
it's
extremely
expensive
and
inefficient
to
follow
the
colgate
regime,
that
for
those
manufacturers
for
whom
resale
price
maintenance
would
be
in
effect
a
strategy
like
leegin
it's
more
efficient
to
do
it
in
many
circumstances
by
agreement,
rather
than
the
disruption
that
is
entailed
when
you
terminate
a
dealer
without
further
discussion
for
discounting
one
item
in
order
to
keep
your
policy
in
place.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
in
1945
during
the
height
of
the
fair
trade
era
the
ftc
did
a
study
which
concluded
only
about
5
percent
of
the
economy
was
affected
by
fair
trade.
and
the
fair
trade
regime,
remember,
is
a
different
and
more
extreme
regime.
there
it
was
per
se
legality,
not
rule
of
reason.
so
it's
just...
there's
just
no
basis
for
these
assertions
that
somehow
the
economy
is
going
to
be
massively
changed.
but
it
is
also
perfectly
clear
and
undisputed
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it
is
more
efficient
for
a
manufacturer
to
adopt
resale
price
maintenance.
it
will
enhance
its
ability
to
compete
and
it
will
provide
consumers
more
of
what
they
want,
and
that
is
a
good
thing
and
the
antitrust
laws
should
not
automatically
foreclose
that
merely
because
in
a
small
percentage
of
cases
it
is
conceivable
that
there
can
be
anticompetitive
effects.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
not
aware
of
any
reason
to
believe
that,
your
honor,
based
on
the
historical
record
and
based
on
the
modern
realities.
the
wal-marts
of
the
world
have
succeeded
because
of
their
discounting
strategy.
that's
not
going
to
change,
and
manufacturers
have
an
incentive
to
have
their
goods
sold
through
those
stores
and
that's
not
going
to
change
either
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
and
with
respect--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would
operate
as
it
does
usually,
which
is
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
establish
an
anticompetitive
effect
resulting
from
the
challenged
conduct,
and
once
that
burden
is
overcome
the
defendant
would
be
required
to
come
up
with
some
legitimate
business
justification,
some
pro-competitive
results
that
outweigh
that.
and
only
if
they
could
do
that
would
they
succeed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
in
cases
where
resale
price
maintenance
is
being
used
to
facilitate
cartelization,
either
at
the
manufacturer
or
the
retail
level,
the
plaintiff
could
prevail.
also
in,
for
example,
in
an
oligopolistic
market.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
don't
know
that.
it
seems
likely
to
assume
that,
though,
and
that's
not
a
bad
thing.
leegin
is
obviously
not
dominant
in
the
market.
it's
obviously
not
going
to
succeed
unless
what
it
is
offering
at
a
higher
price
is
what
consumers
want,
and
that
is
a
good
thing
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you.
