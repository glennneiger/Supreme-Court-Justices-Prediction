mr.
olson,
suppose
just
the
dealers
in
new
york,
the
retail
dealers
agreed
among
themselves
on
the
price.
would
that
be
lawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that
it's
per
se
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
that
be
any
different
from
the
arrangement
where
those
dealers
all
got
together
in
the
convention
and
recommended
to
the
manufacturer
that
he
impose
a
vertical
restraint
of
precisely
the
same
dimensions?
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
i'm
asking
what
if
he
did,
why
should
you
draw
a
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
they
just
passed
a
resolution
asking
the
manufacturer
to
impose
this
vertical
restraint
and
ways
to
do
it.
should
that
be
different
from
one
in
which
the
manufacturer
does
it
independently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there
was
in
the
patent
case,
though,
mr.
olson.
we
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
patent
law
changed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
your
argument
also
apply
to
a
conspiracy
among
the
new
york
dealers
in
this
product
just
to
fix
prices?
because
there's
plenty
of
interbrand
competition,
i
think.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it's
absolutely
clear
that
that
would
always
be
anti-competitive
because
they
would
also
agree
to
provide
additional
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
a
case
in
which
it's
the
dealers
who
want
to
agree
to
provide
extra
services
at
higher
prices
as
their
method
of
better
serving
the
public
and
they
all
agree
that
they
have
to
be
conscious
about
the
competition
from
other
brands.
why
can
we
be
absolutely
certain
that's
always
going
to
be
harmful
to
the
consumer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
might
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
manufacturers:
we
think
we'll
make
more,
all
make
more
money
if
we
concentrate
on
service
rather
than
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
the
conspiracy
that
it
facilitated
was
just
with
intrabrand
competition.
there
wasn't
conspiracy
that
affected
interbrand
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i'm
not
sure
that
economically
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
dealers
are
the
one
who
decide
to
do
it
or
the
manufacturer
was,
or
they
all
did
it
at
the
same
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
we
say
the
rule
or
reason
should
apply
to
all
cases
that
just
affect
intrabrand
competition,
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
keep
this
outmoded
rule
about
horizontal
conspiracies
that
only
affect
intrabrand
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
on
the
congressional
point
that
there
was
a
period
when
congress
would
have
prohibited
the
solicitor
general
from
making
the
argument
he
made
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
a
legislative
expression
of
a
position
on
this
particular
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
just
giving
them
an
additional
ground
for
termination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
just
giving,
you're
just
suggesting
we
should
give
them
an
additional
ground
for
termination.
