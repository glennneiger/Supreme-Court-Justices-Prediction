chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-480,
leegin
creative
leather
products
versus
psks
incorporated.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe,
mr.
olson,
you
could
give
us
an
example
where
the
rule
of
reason
would
find
a
violation
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about...
what
about
the
reliance
interest,
though?
i
mean,
hasn't
a
whole
industry
of
discount
stores
developed
in
reliance
on
the
dr.
miles
rule?
and
don't
we
need
to
be
concerned
about
the
disruption
to
that
established
practice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
hungar?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
what's
the
great
benefit
then
in
changing
the
rule
if
it's
perfectly
legal
to
achieve
the
same
result
already?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
coykendall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
main
objection
to...
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
propose
a
rule
of
reason.
why,
why
can't
the
rule
of
reason
work
to
promote
the
objectives
you've
just
articulated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
a
small
dealer.
but
as
we've
already
heard,
the
dealers
who
engage
in
the
discount
policy
are
places
like
target
and
wal-mart.
those
aren't
small
dealers.
those
are
behemoths
in
the
retailing
industry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
the
ping
brief
that
was
referenced
earlier
made
a
point
that
it
made,
the
prices
may
be...
resale
price...
the
current
dr.
miles
rule
may
result
in
increased
prices
because
of
the
inefficiencies
for
those
retailers,
or
of
those
manufacturers
who
want
to
establish
a
regime
where
something
other
than
price
is
important,
and
they
have
to
do
that
unilaterally,
which
increases
inefficiencies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
why
can't...
eliminating
the
rule,
i
thought
the
whole
point
was
they
would
just
put
in
their
contracts,
you
have
to
sell
it
at
this
price,
and
they
could
enforce
the
contracts,
rather
than
having
to
have
these
machinations
of
making
sure
they
don't
do
anything
that
looks
like
an
agreement
with
their
retailers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
you
argue
that
those
are
more
efficient
than
resale
price
maintenance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
can
add
the
contractual
provisions
you
were
talking
about
to
a
contract
that
has
a
minimum
resale
price.
the
minimum
resale
price
is
to
take
away
the
incentive
from
the
retailer
not
to
carry
through
on
the
non-price
aspects.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
reference
to
the
will
of
congress,
they
haven't
enacted
legislation
that
supports
the
result
you
seek.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
underwood?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
also
been
settled
law
for
90
years
under
the
colgate
doctrine
that
manufacturers
can
achieve
the
same
results,
albeit
more
inefficiently.
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
allow
them
to
adopt
the
most
efficient
means
to
an
end
that
is
already
completely
legal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
of
course,
they
could
always
pass
a
law
saying
that
if
their
intent
is
so
clear.
they
didn't
do
that
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
could.
i
mean,
you
could
easily
write
the
agreement
saying
you
have
to
charge
this
much
and
because
you
have
to
charge
this
much
you
also
have
to
provide
the
training,
the
service,
whatever
the
non-price
inducements
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
the
retailer,
but
then
the
retailer
might
have
a
real
incentive
not
to
do
a
good
job
on
the
service
because
they
really
want
to
market
it
for
price,
not
for
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
you
have
the
free
rider
problem,
which
is
you
go
to
the
fancy
show
room,
you
figure
out
what
you
want,
and
then
you
buy
it
at
the
discount
store.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
no
longer
is
applicable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
olson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
