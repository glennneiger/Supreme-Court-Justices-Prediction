isn't
there
evidence
that
the,
basically
that
the
rise
of
the
wal-marts
and
the
targets
is
correlated
with
the
demise
of
fair
trade?
so...
that
there's
that
correlation.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
do
have
empirical
evidence,
though,
don't
we,
that
the
decision
of
this
case
is
going
to
be
very
significant
in
the
sort
of
battle
between
wal-mart
and
the
main
street
stores;
and
why
should
this
court
in
effect
take
a
shot
in
the
dark
at
resolving
that,
as
distinct
from
leaving
it
to
congress,
which
is
in
a
position
to
know
more
about
where
the
shot
is
going
to
land
than
we
are?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
my
point.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
body
of
some
empirical
evidence
that
the
success
of
the
wal-marts
and
the
targets
and
the
home
depots
was
a
success
which
was
correlated
with
the
elimination
of
price
maintenance
by
the
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
began,
but
they
have
flourished
in
the
post-fair
trade
era.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
that
answer
your
argument
that
there
isn't
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
going
to
be
disruption
if
dr.
miles
goes,
because
now
it's
going
to
be
easy?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
there
may
be
a
massive
reorientation
in
the
retail
economy
if
dr.
miles
goes?
and
that
gets
to
my
problem,
why
should
we
be
the
people
to
make
a
guess
as
opposed
to
the
congress
as
the
institution
to
make
the
guess?
