justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
very.
which
economists?
i
know
the
chicago
school
tends
to
want
rule
of
reason
and
so
forth.
professor
sherer
is
an
economist,
isn't
he?
worked
at
the
ftc
for
a
long
time.
a
good
expert
in
the
field.
he
points
out
the
drug
industry
after
you
got
rid
of...
after
you
got
rid
of
resale
price
maintenance,
the
margins
fell
40
percent.
the
drug
stores
it
went
down
20
percent.
he
says
with
blue
jeans,
alone,
it
saved
american
consumers
$200
million
to
get
rid
of
it.
and
his
conclusion
is,
as
in
the
uniform
enforcement
of
resale
price
maintenance,
the
restraints
can
impose
massive
anti-consumer
benefits.
massive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
that
sounds
like
is
that
if
at
least
he,
who
is
an
economist,
thinks
if
you
get
rid
of
dr.
miles,
every
american
will
pay
far
more
for
the
goods
that
they
buy
at
retail.
now
that's
one
economist,
of
course.
there
are
other
whose
think
differently.
so
how
should
we
decide
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
overturn
dr.
miles
and
run
that
risk?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
supposed
to
count
economists?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
how
we
decide
it?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
haven't
seen
a
consensus.
a
consensus?
isn't,
doesn't
sherer
and
all
these
people,
doesn't
that
point
of
view
count,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know.
we
have...
you
talked
about...
just
for
fun
i
got
out
of
the
library
a
book
by
professor
b.
s.
yamey,
called
resale
price
maintenance
where
he
has
five
economists...
now
maybe
you're
not
going
to
count
them
as
economists.
now
i
didn't
find
in
that
book
a
single
argument
that
isn't
also
in
your
briefs,
nor
did
i
find
in
your
brief
as
single
argument
that
isn't
in
the
book.
there's
one
interesting
thing
about
the
book.
it
was
written
in
1966.
so
i
guess
my
question
is
what's
changed?
now
i
know
two
things
have
changed.
one
is
there's
evidence
in
canada,
britain,
and
in
the
states
that
were
under
miller-tydings,
that
when
you
got
rid
of
resale
price
maintenance,
prices
went
down.
that's
changed.
and
the
second
thing
that's
changed
is
there's
far
more
concentration,
i
gather,
today
in
the
retail
side
of
the
market
than
there
are
used
to
be,
a
factor
which
makes
resale
price
maintenance
dangerous
because
it's
more
likely
to
take
place
at
the
request
of
the
dealers.
now,
i
see
those
two
changes.
my
question
to
you
is
looking
at
yamey's
book
which
is
called
resale
price
maintenance,
so
you
might
have
found
even
it
even
on
google,
and...
what's
changed?
what's
new?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i'll
put
my
question,
which
is
really
just
one
for
this.
i
understand
perfectly
that
the
per
se
rule
is
a
result
of
balancing
differ
things.
of
course,
resale
price
maintenance
does
raise
prices,
and
it
is
very
often
anticompetitive.
of
course,
sometimes,
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
that
might
help
consumers.
now,
in
addition,
you
need
clear
rules.
now
those
three
sets
of
things
require
a
balance.
and
we
have
a
hundred
years
of
history
where
this
court
and
congress
and
others
have
balanced
those
three
sets
of
considerations,
and
they've
come
out
one
way.
now,
the
department
of
justice
wants
to
rebalance
them
and
come
out
the
other
way.
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides.
why
should
we
overrule
a
case
that's
96
years
old,
in
the
absence
of
any...
any...
congressional
indication
that
that's
a
good
idea,
when
it's
simply
a
question
in
a
difficult
area
of
people
reaching
a
slightly
different
weight
on
some
these
three
sets
of
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
it
is
quite
a
close
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
even
so.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
price
fixing,
horizontal,
i
guess,
or
territorial
divisions,
we
should
overturn
those
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
say
is
right.
what
you
say
there
is
right.
i
feel
i'm
back
in
1966.
the
argument
against
that
is,
we
don't
know
which
way
the
push
comes.
the
large
retailers,
home
depot,
whatever
they
are,
huge
retailers,
they
want...
or
maybe
it
isn't
the
discounters,
it's
some
other
ones.
we
don't
know
which
way.
you're
throwing
it
into
court.
you're
throwing
it
before
12
people
who
may
or
may
not
work
this
thing
out.
so
the
argument
against
what
you're
saying
is
not
logic.
it's
empirical
and
administrative.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
was.
that's
what
it
is
now,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
internet...
is
it...
you
would
have
said
fourty
years
ago,
or
i
think
we
are
in
this
argument,
you
would
have
said
that
it's
the
large
discounters,
the
growing
discounters,
the
walgreen's
of
the
world
who
want
to
get
rid
of
retail
price
maintenance,
it's
there
to
help
the
mom
and
pops.
okay.
they're
in
now,
they're
big,
and
they
may
want
to
maintain
resale
prices
because
they
may
want
to
extract
the
extra
profit,
while
the
internet
little
company
comes
in
and
says
i
can
get
it
to
you
cheaper.
now
i
can
imagine
circumstances
like
you
say.
i
can
imagine
they're
not
like
you
say.
i
don't
know.
and
so
what
should
i
do
if
i
really
don't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
justice
kennedy
said,
justice
stevens,
souter,
ginsburg
and
i
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
i
just
want
to
emphasize
one
point
here
and
it
is
stare
decisis
that
the
legal
rule
that
prohibits
vertical
price
fixing
it
comes
from
the
case
called
dr.
miles
is
nearly
a
100-years-old.
it's
well
known
to
those
in
the
law
and
in
the
business.
this
court
and
lower
courts
have
followed
it
consistently
for
decades.
none
of
the
information
the
majority
relies
upon
to
overrule
it
is
it
all
new
i
doubt
it.
stare
decisis
doesn’t
apply
to
antitrust
read
the
baseball
antitrust
case.
on
monday
in
the
campaign
finance
case,
several
members
of
today’s
majority
pointed
to
stare
decisis
consideration
and
they
listed
them
and
they
said
in
that
case
they
believe
it
justified
overturning
of
recent
precedent.
if
you
read
those
factors
you
will
find
that
every
single
one
of
them
in
this
case
are
views
for
keeping
our
96-years-old
dr.
miles
alive
because
the
majority
abandoned
stare
decisis
without
justification.
i
respectfully
dissent.
