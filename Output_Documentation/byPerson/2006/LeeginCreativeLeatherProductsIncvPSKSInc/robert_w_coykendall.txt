mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
recently
as
last
month,
this
court
restated
a
guiding
principle
of
antitrust
jurisprudence:
discouraging
price
cuts
and
depriving
consumers
of
low
prices
is
bad
antitrust
policy.
rpm
prohibits
price--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--well,
we
aren't
talking
about
any
arrangement--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--i
don't
discount
all
those
things.
all
those
things
are
available
under
our
current
regime
where
we
have
a
per
se
prohibition
against
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
and
there's
no
question
that
even
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
providing
that
service.
he
was
providing
it
more
efficiently
and
he
just
wanted
to
pass
those
efficiencies
on.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
the
record
shows
that
with
this
specific
company,
most
of
the
growth
of
its
sales
occurred
before
it
established
a
resale
price
maintenance
policy.
so
there
are
no
demonstrated
benefits
from
this
company
of
imposing
and
enforcing
a
resale
price
maintenance
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
as
a
practical
matter
for
someone
in
my
position,
or
plaintiff's
position,
it's
impossible
for
a
small
dealer
to
muster
the
resources
in
order
to
put
forth--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--i
would
suggest
that
those
are
not
the
people
that
really
are
being
protected
by
this
particular
per
se
prohibition.
it
is
the
small
mom
and
pop
operation
like
my
client
that
wants
to
innovate
and
expand
and
pass
on
efficiencies
and
compete
with
the
big
discounters
who
might
have
power
of
their
own
in
order
to
secure
discounts.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
no,
i
absolutely
agree
with
that.
but
it's
resale
price
maintenance
that
enables
these
initiators,
these
small
companies,
these
small
operations,
to
grow
and
innovate,
achieve
the
efficiencies,
and
pass
those
on,
attract
customers
by
reducing
prices.
and
all
that
is
stopped
by
imposition
of
a
resale
price--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--again,
the
large-scale
dominant
players
in
the
retail
industry
have
their
own
market
power.
they
don't
need
the
protection
of
the
per
se
rule
in
order
to
enforce
them.
it's
the
next
generation
that
this
rule
really
aims
to
protect.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
again
i
would
suggest
that
under
this
current
system
the
way
it
is
we
have
both
the
full
service
providers
of
complete
service
that
offer
goods
at
a
certain
price
and
we
have
discounters
selling
those
same
goods.
there
is
currently
a
mix
of
service
and
price
that
better
serves
the
economy
than
just
having
one
cookie
cutter...
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
that
you
would
have
with
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
in
terms
of
prohibiting
price
or
in
terms
of,
yes,
prohibiting
price
fixing,
that's
true.
but
it
permits
stores
to
have
full
price
and
full
service
and
charge
high
prices
for
that
service,
and
it
permits
discounters
to
reduce
price,
reduce
service
and
cater
to
those
customers
who
want
the
goods
with
lower
service.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
there
is
no
doubt
that
resale
price
maintenance
raises
prices
to
consumers.
the
only
economic
doubt
is
whether
there
are
any
redeeming
effects
of
those
prices;
and
that's
where
the
economic
dispute
of
this
is.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that,
first
of
all,
eliminating
the
per
se
rule
would
not
decrease
the
inefficiencies
of
the
colgate
doctrine.
if
they
want
to
impose
resale
price
maintenance
in
order
to
avoid
even
a
rule
of
reasoned
approach,
they
would
have
to
go--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--i
believe
that
anomaly
really
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
which
is
aimed
at
contracts,
combinations
and
conspiracies.
unilateral
conduct
isn't
reached
by
that,
it's
the
price
of
being
in
a
fair
country.
people
can
deal
in
ways
that
they
want
to
with
this
particular
issue.
but
again,
eliminating
the
per
se
rule
will
not
help
ping
out
if
they
want
to
maintain
their
retail
price
maintenance
as
legal,
as
unilateral.
they'll
still
have
to
go
through
these
same
machinations.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
again,
then
they
would
be
subject
to
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
and
the
uncertainties
occasioned
with
that
as
to
whether
this
contract
is
lawful.
if
they
want
to
avoid
that,
then
of
course,
they
would
have
to
stick
with
the
colgate
doctrine.
your
honor,
this
particular
case,
we
have
clear
evidence
that
rpm
was
used
to
facilitate
a
horizontal
retailer
cartel.
we
have
evidence
in
the
briefs
that
leegin
would
gather
its
dealers
in
a
dealer
meeting,
discuss
the
policy,
agree
to
changes,
and
reach
a
consensus,
and
then
enforce
that
policy
against
everyone.
one
of
the
evils
of
resale
price
maintenance
is
specifically
this:
it
does
facilitate
the
formation
of
cartels.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
retail--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--horizontal
conspiracies,
even
among
a
single
brand,
has
always
been
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
you
can
look
back
at
the--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--there
you're
striking
really
at
the
heart
of
the...
the
heart
of
the
sherman
act,
et
al.,
holding
that
horizontal
conspiracies,
which
nobody
believes
promote
competition,
could
be
justified
under
the
same
thinking.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
in
this
particular
case
there
is
a
complete
alignment
of
incentives,
because
the
manufacturer
was
also
a
retailer
competing
in
this
market.
he
has
the
incentive
to
increase
retailer
profits.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
the
horizontal
conspiracy
between
leegin
as
a
retailer
and
the
other
retailers
offering
his
products
is
more
than
just
a
rule
of
reason
approach.
that
would
be
per
se
illegal
under
this
court's
precedents.
retail
price
maintenance
also
has
the
problem
we
discussed
earlier
of
perpetuating
incumbent
forms
of
distribution
at
the
expense
of
the
innovative
and
more
efficient
distribution
means.
retailers,
in
retail
competition
matters,
retailers
should
be
entitled
to
innovate,
pass
efficiencies
along
to
customers
in
the
form
of
lower
prices,
attract
new
customers,
and
grow
in
that
manner.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
leegin.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
that
particular
aspect
was
referred
to;
it
wasn't
pursued
as
a
separate
part
of
this.
prior
to
trial,
the
judge
did
rule
that
the
dr.
miles
line
of
cases
applied
and
the
conduct
would
be
judged
under
the
per
se
rule.
so
certain
aspects
with
respect
to
the
horizontal
conspiracy
and
the
differences
in
discounts...
i
mean,
developed
that
much.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
yes.
we
would
suggest
the
record
is
sufficient
that
on
remand
the
instruction
given
the
jury
as
to
the
standard
by
which
their
conduct
could
be
judged
could
be
sustained
as
a
per
se
violation
under
the
rules
related
to
horizontal
conspiracies
as
well.
and
again,
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
if
the
court
doesn't
reach
that,
it
should
remand
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
them
to
consider
whether
that
is
a
possibility.
resale
price
maintenance
can
distort
consumer
choice.
the
retailers...
so
the
person
comes
into
the
store...
the
retailers
can
exercise
pressure
to
influence
the
selection
of
higher
margin
products
over
ones
that
may
better
fit
the
consumer
needs.
that
is
an
evil
of
resale
price
maintenance,
whether
or
not
it
does
promote
efficiencies.
and
if
resale
price
maintenance
does
act
as
it
is
theorized,
to
increase
retailer
services,
some
consumers
will
be
worse
off,
they'll
be
paying
for
services
they
don't
want.
there
are
alternatives
to
rpm.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
if...
what
you're
doing
is
you're
building
in
this
high
margin
that
gives
the
retailer
an
incentive
to
do
that.
if
there
is
no
resale
price
maintenance
so
that
margin
isn't
guaranteed,
the
incentive
disappears.
what
is
clear
is
that
retail...
resale
price
maintenance
is
a
blunt
instrument
to
achieve
any
economies.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
that's
the
only
incentive,
the
only
reason
for
imposing
resale
prices--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--well,
there
are
more
efficient
ways
than
rpm
to
achieve
any
benefits
of
efficiency,
such
as
contracts
with
the
retailers
to
provide
those
additional
demand
creating
services.
he
could
pay
the
retailers
to
provide
those
services.
he
could
provide
those
services
directly,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
the
resale
price
maintenance
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
throwing
money
at
the
problem.
you're
guaranteeing
a
margin
and
you're
hoping
that
it's
going
to
be
used
somehow
for
the
consumer's
benefit,
and
you've
got
no
guarantee
that
any
dealer
is
going
to
use
the
margin
that
they're
guaranteed
in
any
way
to
service
the
consumers.
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
geographically
isolated
areas--
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
--if
you
have
a
contract
requiring
those
services,
you
don't
need
the
minimum
resale
price.
that's
just
completely
unnecessary.
and
that
would
prohibit
the
efficient
dealer
from
passing
on
those
efficiencies
to
its
consumers.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
it
could
be.
it
may
not.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
well,
under...
the
idea
is
the
manufacturer
chooses
to
deal
with
only
those
dealers
that
offer
this
particular
service.
they
sign
a
contract
to
provide
that
service.
if
they
don't
want
to
provide
that
service,
they
don't
sign
the
contract,
these
don't
get
the
goods.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
if
the
question
is
providing
a
larger
margin
to
the
dealer,
the
most
efficient
way
is
for
the
manufacturer
simply
to
lower
their
wholesale
price,
and
the
margin
the
dealer
receives
is
higher.
again,
if
there
are
other
efficiencies,
they
might
be
achieved
by
exclusive
territories
as
permitted
by
sylvania
or
by
the
colgate
doctrine.
i
would
suggest
the
experience
of
the
30
years
following
the
elimination
of
the
fair
trade
laws
have
shown
the
wisdom
of
the
dr.
miles
decision
which
places
faith
in
the
free
market
system.
this
court
should
continue
to
honor
its
precedents
and
respect
the
will
of
congress
by
adhering
to
the
dr.
miles
rule.
mr.
robert
w.
coykendall
your
honor,
as
this
court
observed
in
sylvania,
congress
by
repealing
the
miller-tydings
mcguire
act
did
indicate
its
support
for
the
per
se
rule.
i
believe
the
court
should
adhere
to
that
holding
as
well.
