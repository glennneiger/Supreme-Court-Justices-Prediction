justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if,
if
indeed
that's,
that's
what
he's
aiming
at,
low
price.
is
it
the
object
of
the...
is
the
sole
object
of
the
sherman
act
to
produce
low
prices?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
consumer
welfare.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
some
consumers
would
prefer
more
service
at
a
higher
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that
it
would
increase
prices
doesn't
prove
anything.
it
doesn't
prove
that
it's
serving
consumer
welfare.
if,
in
fact,
it's
giving
the
consumer
a
choice
of
more
service
at
a
somewhat
higher
price,
that
would
enhance
consumer
welfare,
so
long
as
there
are
competitive
products
at
a
lower
price,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
know
why,
why
we
should
have
to
focus
our
entire
attention
on
whether
it's
going
to...
going
to
produce
higher
prices
or
not.
the
market
out
there
has
different
goods
at
different
prices
which
have
different
qualities
that
attract
different
consumers.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
i
mean,
you
really
think
that
antitrust
policy
means
when...
any
arrangement
that
produces
a
higher
price
is
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
lot
of
consumers
want,
you
know,
extended
warranties.
they
want
show
rooms
where
they
can
go
and
look
at
things.
all
of
which
costs
more
money.
and
where
you
can
not
have
resale
price
maintenance
the
customers...
or
you
have
the
free
rider
problem.
the
customers
shop
at
the
place
that
has
the
big
show
room,
likes
at
all
the
product
there,
and
goes
and
buys
it
from
somebody
else
who
has
not
incurred
that
expense.
now,
i
just
don't
think
that
all
the
customers
want
is
cheap.
i
think
they
want
other
things
besides
cheap.
i
think
they
want
service.
i
think
they
want
selection.
i
think
they
want
the
ability
to
view
goods
and
so
forth.
why
do
you
discount
all
of
those
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
aren't
available.
this
company
thought
that
it
could
provide
higher
service
if
it
could
assure
its
retailers
that
they
would
not
be
undercut
by
people
who
are
not
providing
that
kind
of
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't,
i
don't
know
that
there's
no
question
about
that.
there's
certainly
no
question
that
this
company
was
successful
in
breaking
into
a
difficult
market
with
its
strategy
of
assuring
its
retailers
a
cushion
so
that
they
could
provide
the
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
if
it
was
really
the
case
that
they
were
going
to
be
losing,
losing
profits,
i
think
they
would
have
been
here.
i
mean,
we
talk
about
the
wal-marts
and
the
targets.
they're
not
here
on
amicus
briefs
because
they're...
what
they're
selling
is
cheap.
they
are
selling
price,
and
people
who
want
low
price
and
for
whom
that's
of
value
above
all
other
things
are
going
to
continue
to
go
to
those
stores.
so
they're
not
going
to
be
harmed
by
the
fact
that
some
manufacturers
want
to
provide
not
just
the
low
price...
of
course,
they'll
try
to
keep
the
price
as
low
as
possible...
but
service.
i
just
don't
see
what,
what
harm
can
possibly
come,
so
long
as
there's
no
market
dominance,
from
allowing
some
people
to
make
their
money
on
service
and...
rather
than
cheap
price.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it's
a
totally...
i
cannot
imagine
why
a
horizontal
conspiracy
among
dealers
could
ever
produce
consumer
welfare.
it
will
be
a
horizontal
conspiracy
to
get
more
money
out
of
the
consumer;
but
whereas
the
manufacturer
who
wants
to
impose
resale
price
maintenance,
his
interest
isn't
to
give
the
retailer
as
much...
more
money
than
the
retailer
is
now
making.
he's
going
to
try
to
keep
their
margin
just
as
low
as
it
ever
was,
so
that
he
can
sell
as
many
of
his
products
as
possible
consistent
with
his
desire
to
sell
his
product
by
attaching
to
it
more
service,
better
warranty,
more
showrooms,
whatever.
you
know,
horizontal
conspiracy,
the
incentives
are
entirely
different.
when
you're
dealing
with
a
manufacturer,
it
seems
to
me
his
incentive
is
still
to
keep
the
price
as
low
as
possible
consistent
with
the
additional
good
that
he
wants
to
give
consumers
to
attract
those
consumers
to
his
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
if
that
makes
a
difference,
the
rule
of
reason
would
allow
you
to
make
that
argument.
but
you...
but
you
want
to
say
it's
bad
across
the
board
for
everybody.
if
indeed
there's
something
peculiar
about
this
case,
the
rule
of
reason
would
allow
you
to
argue
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
suppose
there's
any...
i
don't
suppose
there's
any
way
to
protect
against
the
fallout
to
the
consumer,
is
there?
i
mean
if
indeed,
if
indeed
a
store
presses
on
a
consumer
a
product
that's
more
expensive
than
what
he
needs
or...
and
what
he
wants,
is
this
a
real
argument
against
this,
that
there's
some
stupid
consumers
whose
can
be
conned?
i
mean,
whatever
rule
we
adopt,
that's
going
to
be
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
assuming
that
the...
that
the
retailer
has
a
higher
margin
on
the
resale
price
good.
why
do
you
assume
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
only
going
to
be
given
the
thing
if
he
does
the
kind
of
additional
service
that
the
manufacturer
wants.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
and
the
manufacturer
is
going
to
try
to
keep
his
margin
just
as
low
as
he
can
consistent
with
the...
you
know...
consistent
with
selling
as
many
products
as
he
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it's
often
the
case.
give
me
some
other
examples
where
you
can
achieve
the
same
industry-wide
effect
unilaterally.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
they
relying
on
dr.
miles
or
were
they
relying
on
us?
that's
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
left
the
situation
where
it
was,
which
is
that
the
antitrust
law
is
as
determined
by
this
court,
and
we
had
shown
our
willingness
to
update
the
antitrust
law
when
sound
economic
doctrine
suggests
is
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
some
manufacturers
want
their
product
associated
with
excellent
service,
high
warranty,
and
all
of
that.
and
there
is
no
way
to
get
that
uniformly
for
that
product
without
this
kind
of
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
congress
changed
its
mind
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that.
[laughter]
