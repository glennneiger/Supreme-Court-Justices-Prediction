mr.
olson,
does
brand
competition
generally
help
retailers,
or
is
this
a
question
that
can't
be
answered?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
interbrand,
interbrand
competition?
do
retailers
like
interbrand
competition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we're
talking
about
inter...
we're
talking
about
retailers.
it,
it
seems
to
me
at
the
outset
of
the
argument,
you...
you
acknowledged,
and
i
think
it
is
the
general
rule...
that
if
the
retailers
themselves
have
this
resale
price
maintenance,
it
is
invalid.
well,
if
the
manufacturer
does
this
just
for
the
convenience
of
the
retailers,
and
that's...
many
of
the
examples
in
your
brief,
it
is
for
the
convenience
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
retailers,
then
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
per
se
rule?
why
should
we
allow
the
manufacturer
to
do
something
we
that
wouldn't
allow
the
retailers
to
do,
if
it's
for
the
retailers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
the
per
se
rule
was
the
cookie
cutter
approach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
presume
a
contract
in
which
the
retailer
has
a
separate
charge
for
the
service?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
not,
i
don't
see
how
that
would
work
under
your
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
06-480;
leegin
creative
leather
products,
inc.
v.
psks,
inc.
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
prohibits
every
contract,
combination
of
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
the
usual
way
to
determine
whether
a
particular
business
practice
violates
section
1
is
to
ask
whether
it
is
unreasonable
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
case.
in
this
case
the
court
considers
a
particular
type
of
restraint,
a
vertical
price
restraint
or
resale
price
maintenance
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
restraint
should
be
judged
by
the
usual
rule
or
reason,
or
should
be
always
illegal
and
that
latter
option
is
referred
to
as
a
rule
of
per
se
illegality.
in
a
case
called
dr.
miles
medical
co.
v.
john
d.
park
&
sons
co.
decided
almost
a
century
ago
in
1911.
the
court
established
the
rules
of
these
types
of
vertical
price
restraint
are
per
se
illegal
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
petitioner
now
asked
us
to
disavow
that
per
se
rule.
the
petitioner
leegin
creative
leather
products,
inc.
sells
a
variety
of
women’s
fashion
accessories
and
the
brand
name
for
those
is
brighton.
now
pursuing
to
the
pricing
policy
leegin
refused
to
sell
to
retailers
the
discounted
brighton
goods
below
the
suggested
retailer
prices.
the
respondent
is
psks,
inc.
it
operates
kay’s
closet,
women’s
apparel
store
in
louisville,
texas.
kay’s
closet
sold
the
brighton
brand
for
several
years
but
then
leegin
stopped
selling
to
the
store
after
discovered
the
kay’s
closet
had
been
marking
down
the
prices
on
brighton’s
entire
line.
psks
sued
alleging
that
leegin’s
pricing
policy
in
fact
was
in
agreement
with
its
retailers
to
set
minimum
resale
prices
and
the
jury
agreed
with
psks
and
awarded
psks
$1.2
million
which
was
then
trebled
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
based
on
the
per
se
rule
established
by
dr.
miles
it
rejected
leegin’s
argument
that
the
rule
of
the
reason
should
have
applied
to
the
resale
price
maintenance
agreements.
we
now
conclude
that
the
rule
of
reason
not
the
per
se
rule
should
be
applied
to
vertical
price
restraint
and
we
does
overrule
dr.
miles
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
now
each
side
of
the
debates
can
find
sources
to
support
its
position,
it
suffices
to
stay
here
that
economic
literature
is
replete
with
pro-competitive
justifications
for
a
manufacture’s
use
of
resale
price
maintenance.
the
few
recent
studies
documenting
the
competitive
effects
of
resale
price
maintenance
also
cast
doubt
on
the
conclusion
that
the
practice
meets
the
criteria
for
per
se
rule.
the
justifications
for
the
vertical
price
restraints
are
similar
to
those
for
other
vertical
restraints.
minimum
resale
price
maintenance
can
stimulate
inter
brand
competition
by
encouraging
retailers
to
invest
in
services
and
promotional
efforts
that
aid
the
manufacturers
position
as
against
rival
manufacturers.
resale
price
maintenance
also
has
the
potential
to
give
consumers
more
options
so
that
they
can
choose
a
low
price,
low
service
brands
or
high
price
high
service
brands
and
brands
that
fall
somewhere
in
between.
absent
vertical
price
restraints,
retail
services
that
enhance
inter
brand
competition
might
be
underprovided.
well
vertical
agreement
setting
minimum
resale
prices
can
have
pro-competitive
justification
they
may
have
anticompetitive
effects
in
other
cases.
resale
price
maintenance
for
example
may
facilitate
a
manufacturer
or
distributor
cartel.
resale
price
maintenance
can
also
be
abused
by
a
powerful
manufacturer
or
retailer.
not
withstanding
these
risk
that
can
not
always
be
stated
with
any
degree
of
confidence
that
resale
price
maintenance
always
or
almost
always
tends
to
restrict
competition
and
decrease
output
whether
court
considering
the
issue
as
an
original
matter.
now
the
rule
of
reason
not
a
per
se
rule
of
unlawfulness
would
be
the
appropriate
standard,
we
did
not
write
on
a
clean
slate
of
course.
the
decision
in
dr.
miles
as
i
indicated
is
almost
a
century
old
so
there
is
an
argument
for
it's
retention
on
the
basis
of
stare
decisis
alone.
stare
decisis
is
not
a
significant
in
this
case
however
because
the
issue
before
us
is
the
scope
of
the
sherman
act.
the
court
has
treated
this
statute
as
a
common
law
statute
and
stare
decisis
we
conclude
does
not
compel
our
continued
adherence
to
the
per
se
rule
against
vertical
price
restraints.
in
the
antitrust
context
the
fact
that
a
decision
has
been
“called
into
serious
question”
justifies
our
reevaluation
of
it
and
we
have
overruled
our
precedents
when
later
cases
have
undermined
their
doctrinal
underpinnings.
the
court’s
treatment
of
vertical
restraints
has
progressed
away
from
dr.
miles’
strict
approach
we
distanced
ourselves
from
the
opinion’s
rational
in
various
cases.
the
court
following
a
common-law
approach
has
continued
to
temper,
limit,
or
overrule
once
strict
prohibitions
on
vertical
restraints.
in
1977,
the
court
overturned
the
per
se
rule
for
vertical
non-price
restraints,
adopted
the
rule
of
reason
in
its
stead.
continuing
in
this
direction
in
two
cases
in
the
1980’s
the
court
defined
legal
rules
to
limit
the
reach
of
dr.
miles.
most
recently
in
1997,
after
examining
the
issue
of
vertical
maximum
price-fixing
agreements
in
light
of
commentary
and
real
experience
the
court
overruled
a
29-year-old
precedent
treating
those
agreements
as
per
se
illegal.
so
the
dr.
miles
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
these
cases
and
also
inconsistent
with
the
principal
framework.
it
makes
little
economic
sense
when
analyzed
with
our
other
cases
on
vertical
restraints.
it's
a
flawed
antitrust
document
which
serves
the
interest
of
lawyers
by
creating
legal
distinctions
that
operates
its
traps
for
the
unwary
more
than
the
interests
of
consumers,
by
requiring
manufacturers
to
choose
second-best
options
to
achieve
sound
business
objectives.
for
these
reasons
the
court’s
decision
in
dr.
miles,
is
now
overruled.
vertical
price
restraints
are
to
be
judged
according
to
the
rule
of
reason.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
