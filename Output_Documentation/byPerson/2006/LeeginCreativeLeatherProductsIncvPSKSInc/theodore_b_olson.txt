mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
per
se
illegality
rule
for
resale
price
maintenance
is
widely
recognized
to
be
outdated,
misguided
and
anticompetitive.
it
should
be
replaced
with
the
same
rule
of
reason
standard
that
applies
to
other
forms
of
vertically
imposed
marketing
restrictions.
the
sherman
act
bars
only
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade
and
the
court
presumptively
applies
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
to
determine
whether
a
restraint
is
unreasonable.
per
se
rules
should
be
rare
and
imposed
only
where
the
court
is
virtually
certain
based
upon
considerable
economic
experience
that
a
practice
is
nearly
invariably
anticompetitive.
vertical
minimum
retail...
resale
price
maintenance
are
plainly
not
invariably
anticompetitive.
in
fact,
a
broad
consensus
of
economists
and
decisions
of
this
court
recognize
that
vertical
restraints
promote
interbrand
competition,
which
is
the
goal
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
are
rarely,
if
ever,
anticompetitive.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
economists
who
have
looked
at
the
use
of
resale
price
maintenance
have
said
that
that
would
very
rarely,
if
ever,
be
the
case.
it
certainly
could
not
be
the
case
in
this
industry
in
connection
with
this
participant
in
the
marketplace.
there
are
something
like
5,000
dealers
that
the
brighton
products
are
sold
through.
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
other
competing
dealers,
hundreds
of
products.
what
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
is
that
programs
such
as
this
may
promote
interbrand
competition,
perhaps--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
i
think
that
that
would
be
covered
by
a
horizontal
prohibition,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it
would
be,
as
horizontal
restraint
among
competing
dealers,
it
could
be
a
per
se
violation
under
horizontal
rules
if
it
was...
if
it
was...
involved
the
manufacturer
in
some
way,
it
could
be
dealt
with
by
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
this
court
said
in
sylvania,
and
said
again
in
the
state
oil
versus
khan,
is
that
the
manufacturer
has
very,
very
little
incentive
to
increase--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
the
motivation
for
the
arrangement,
if
it
comes
from
a
manufacturer...
you're
suggesting
a
hypothetical
in
which
all
of
the
dealers
in
a
particular
area
would
get
together
to
impose
this
on
a
manufacturer.
i
think
it's
very
unrealistic
that
that
would
happen.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
if
the
manufacturer
makes
a
decision,
whether
it's
because
dealers
would
like
to
see
that
happen
or
not,
as
this
court
said
in
business
electronic
versus
sharp
electronics,
there's
of
course
relationships
between
the
dealers
and
the
manufacturers,
that
the
dealers
may
have
an
interest
in
doing
this,
because
they
may
find
for
the
same
reason
that
the
manufacturer
does
that
it
promotes
the
sales
of
products.
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
this
was
an
effective
strategy
for
the
brighton
company,
the
brighton
leegin
company
that's
manufacturing
the
brighton
products,
to
enter
a
very
difficult
and
highly
competitive
marketplace,
and
it
was
successful.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
might
be
a
situation,
the
economists
have
written
about
this,
say
that
it
would
be
very
rare,
and
would
require
retailers
with
a
strong
powerful
market
power
to
impose
a
situation
where
the
manufacturer
would
do
that
to
help
facilitate
a
horizontal
cartel.
that
certainly
was
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
would
probably
be
found
to
violate
the
rule
of
reason.
in
addition,
it
would
probably
be
unlawful
under
the
horizontal
rules
established
by
this
court.
that
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
economists
say
that
that
would
very
seldom
happen.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in,
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
economist
whose
have
looked
at
this
have
come
out
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
justice
breyer.
secondly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
no.
i
think
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
what
this
court...
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
that
under
circumstances
such
as
this
where
there's
a
consensus
among
leading
respected
economists,
that
is
one
factor.
there's
another
factor--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
is
one
factor
that
the
court
should
consider
and
the
court
has
considered
in
the
past
when
dealing
with
something
that
the
court
itself
has
said,
is
an
anachronistic
and
chronologically
schizoid
rule,
to
have
a
rule
of
reason
for
certain
vertical
restraints
and
a
fixed,
rigid,
per
se
rule
with
respect
to
other
vertical
restraints.
the
court...
the
court
itself
has
made
those
pronouncements.
the
enforcing
agencies
have
changed
their
view
with
respect...
and
they
are
here
today,
the
antitrust
division
and
the
federal
trade
commission,
all
of
whom
have
announced
that
they
believe
that
it
is
very
rare
for
a
rule
such
as
this,
for
an
arrangement
such
as
this
to
be
anticompetitive.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
essentially,
the
same
argument
was
made
in
the
sylvania...
at
the
time
of
the
sylvania
case.
the
same
argument
was
made
just
a
term
or
two
go
in
connection
with
the
illinois
tool
case
that
dealt
with
tying
arrangements.
the
same
argument
was
made
in
state
oil
versus
khan.
this
court
has
construed
the
antitrust
laws
as
an
expression
by
congress
that
the
courts
should
be
aware
of
the
dynamic
potential
in
the
marketplace--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
repeal
of
those
statutes,
justice
ginsburg,
repealed
per
se
legality
rules.
it
was
not
a
congressional
expression
against
the
rule
of
reason--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
you
did.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
that
was
a,
that
was
one
factor,
however,
justice
stevens.
i
think,
as
i
read
that
opinion,
the
court
was
also
concerned
with
the
fact
that
the,
the
per
se
rule
which...
and
the
court
said
the
same
thing
just
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case...
to
the
extent
there's
practices
that
can
be
procompetitive,
the
court
should
not
set
a
low
threshold
of
illegality,
especially
low
per
se
illegality
threshold.
there
were...
there
have
been...
it
is
worth
emphasizing
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
we
don't
want
per
se
rules
when
we
don't
have
a
substantial
body
of
economic
experience
that
shows
us
that
this
practice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
really
no
evidence
that
the
marketplace
as
it
exists
today
is
a
result
of
the
dr.
miles
rule
of
1911,
chief
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--actually
i
looked
into
that,
justice
souter.
and
me,
my
limited
historical
research
is
that
the...
those
discounters
were
coming
on
strong
before
1975
which
is
when
the,
the
consumer
price,
whatever
it
was,
act
was
passed
in
response
to
that.
there
are...
the
evidence
basically
shows
that...
and
this
court
has
said...
that
it's
interbrand
competition
that
ultimately
produces
lower
prices.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
a
number
of
things
have
changed.
the...
the
number
of
respected
individuals,
notwithstanding
that
book,
who
have
looked
at
it
and
have
focused
on
the
marketplace,
have
said
that
because
it
allows...
it
increases
the
possibility
of
interbrand
competition,
it
can
provide
incentives
for
dealers
to
provide
service,
differences
in
the
products.
and
other
things
that
have
happened
since
then,
are
this
court's
decision
in
the
sylvania
case,
which...
which
involved
an
elaborate
analysis
of
vertical
restrictions
and
found
that
they
are
largely
procompetitive
and
undermine
the
ruling...
the
reason
for
a
per
se
rule.
this
court's
decision
in
state
oil
versus
khan,
and
the
other
cases
that
this
court
is
very
well
aware
of
where
per
se
rules
have
systematically
been
dismantled
because
they
are
artificial
themselves
in
the
marketplace.
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--did
you
say
inter--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
don't
know
that...
i
don't
know
whether
people
like
competition.
but
the
antitrust
laws
like
competition
and
this
court
likes
competition.
and
this
court
has
said
that
interbrand--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
manufacturer
is
very
unlikely
to
do
this
for
the
convenience
of
the
retailers,
to...
because
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
manufacturer
to
have
the
retail
price
as
low
as
possible
so
that
the
manufacturer
will
sell
as
many
of
the
manufacturers'
products
as
possible.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
precisely.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's...
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i...
i
agree
completely.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
let
me
say
that
that's
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again.
if
you...
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
not
price,
but
it's
competition,
because
competition
between
competing
manufacturers
give
the
consumers
more
choice.
some
people
may
want
the
cheapest
product.
some
people
may
want
the
product
that's
more
available
to
them.
they
may
wish
the
return
policy
or
the
warranty
policy
or
the
repair
policy
that
the
dealer
provides.
and
in
this
marketplace
particularly,
that
system
of
providing
competition
is
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws
and
has
produced
success
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this...
but
the
case
was
never
litigated
on
that
basis.
it
wasn't
considered
on
that
basis
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
came
up
sort
of
as
a
late
thought
in
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
the
case
was
litigated
on
the
per
se
rule
of
dr.
miles.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
respondent
and
its
amici
seem
to
recognize
that
what
this
court
said
in
state
oil
versus
khan,
that
a
vertical
restraint
imposed
by
a
single
manufacturer
or
wholesaler
may
stimulate
interbrand
competition
even
as
it
reduces
intrabrand
competition
and,
by
the
way,
it
enhances
intrabrand
competition
on
matters
of
service
and
availability
and
other
things
in
addition
to
price.
the
respondent
and
their
amici
seem
to
have
acknowledged
these
pro-competitive
factors
but
say
you
should
do
it
by
a
contract
with
5,000
different
retailers,
which
you
then
have
to
go
out
and
enforce,
or
you
have
to
do
it
under
a
colgate
system,
which
the
ping
brief
demonstrates
it's
a
blunt
instrument,
it
requires
terminating
retailers
with
which
you
had
a
relationship
for
years,
it
prohibits
even
talking
to
the
loyal
retailers
to
fix
small
problems.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
the
agreement
is
something,
the
details
can
be
worked
out.
the
manufacturer
can...
and
the
ping
brief
explains
this.
the
manufacturer
can
go
to
the
retailer
and
say:
look,
maybe
you
didn't
get
it
right,
your
sales
person
said
the
wrong
thing;
let's
fix
it,
because
we
want
to
be
dealing
together.
the
antitrust
laws...
in
other
word,
what
the
respondent
and
its
amici
want
or
they
suggest
forward
integration,
so
you
just
acquire
all
your
retailers.
the
benefits
of
these
type
of
arrangements
provide
the
consumers
with
choices.
it
stimulates
interbrand
competition.
it
promotes
intrabrand
competition
on
things
other
than
price.
it
provides
consumers
with
more
choices.
it
ultimately
gives
more
freedom
to
the
manufacturer
to
stimulate
the
sale
of
its
products,
to
enter
the
marketplace.
these
are
things
that
the
court
has
said,
and
provides
a
more
varied
marketplace.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
presumptive
rule
is
a
rule
of
reason.
per
se
rules
should
be
crossed
out
or
not
adopted
unless
they're
dealing
with
a
practice
which
is
invariably
anticompetitive.
this
practice,
as
acknowledged,
is
procompetitive.
it
provides
many
opportunities,
and
it
is
irrational
for
vertical
restrictions
to
exist
in
this
world
in
the
non-price
area
or
the
maximum
price
area
as
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason
and
the
minimum
retail
price
maintenance
under
a
rigid
per
se
rule
that
cannot
be
changed.
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
congress
intended
by
the
use
of
restraint
of
trade
and
the
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
for
this
court
to
continue
to
breathe
life
into
the
restrictions
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
benefit
of
the
consumer
and
in
the
benefit
of
competition,
eliminating
rigid
per
se
rules
which
make
it
unlawful
for
a
manufacturer
to
do
something
that's
rational
in
the
marketplace,
to
give
consumer
choices,
or
to
do
it
in
some
indirect
way
that
is
a
lawyer's
dream
and
an
entrepreneur's
nightmare
makes
no
sense
at
all.
for
all
those
reasons,
the
rule
of
reason
in
this
area,
as
in
the
other
areas,
should
replace
the
per
se
rule
which
is
rigid
and
anticompetitive
at
the
end
of
the
day.
thank
you.
