ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
manufacturer
agrees
with
its
retailers
to
fix
a
minimum
resale
price,
the
whole
point
of
the
agreement
is
to
prevent
price
competition
among
retailers,
to
prevent
discounts.
for
almost
100
years
the
court
has
interpreted
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
to
prohibit
such
price
fixing
agreements.
any
change
in
that
fundamental
understanding
of
the
statute
should
be
made
by
congress
and
not
by
this
court.
the
per
se
rule
against
resale
price
maintenance
is
different
in
at
least
three
ways
from
other
antitrust
rules
that
this
court
has
overturned.
first,
unlike
the
other
rules,
it
alone
has
been
settled
law
for
a
century,
reaffirmed
over
and
over
again
by
this
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
that
tension
that
you...
that
supposed
anomaly
that
you
described
is
simply
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
antitrust
rule...
law
does
not
prohibit
all
anticompetitive
behavior.
it
prohibits
agreements
that
are
anti...
that
restrain
competition.
and
so
it
will
often
be
the
case
that
it
is
possible
for
somebody
unilaterally
to
do
something
that
has
the
same
effect
as
an
agreement,
or
approximately
the
same
effect,
as
the
antitrust
law
simply
draws
that
line
because
of
a
different
value,
a
value
in
preserving--
the
independent
action
of
individuals.
it
is,
however--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
as
you
have
observed,
virtually
any
vertical
restriction
could
be
accomplished
by
having
the
manufacturer
integrate
the
retailing
function
and
become
one
entity
instead
of
two
entities.
then
the
possibility
of
conspiracy
or
agreement
is
eliminated
and
the
manufacturer,
if
he
simply
integrates
the
whole
function,
is...
can
fix
prices,
fix
his,
what
are
in
effect
his
own
prices
and
be
outside
the
reach
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there
are
other
reasons
why
a
manufacturer
might
not
find
it
convenient
to
do
that
integration,
but
it
is
certainly
possible
by
ceasing
to
be
multiple
entities
and
to
become
one
entity
to
avoid
the
prohibitions
of
the
antitrust
law.
it
is
also...
so,
this
is
old
and
well
settled.
unlike
the
schwinn
rule
against
territorial
restraints
which
was
overturned
only
10
years
after
it
was
established,
or
the
albrecht
rule
against
maximum
resale
price
maintenance
which
was
overturned
29
years
after
it
was
established,
this
has
a
much
more
settled
pedigree
in
the
law
and
expectations
have
grown
up
around
it.
second,
it
was
endorsed
and
relied
on
by
congress,
not
enacted
by
congress
but
endorsed
and
relied
on
by
congress,
when
congress
repealed
the
fair
trade
laws
in
1975
by
amending
the
very
statute
this
court
is
now
asked
to
interpret.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
they
were
relying--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
the
legislative
history
described
in
some
detail
in
the
antitrust
institute's
brief
shows
that
actually
they
were
returning
the
law
to
the
per
se
rule
against
resale
price
maintenance
because
they
thought
resale
price
maintenance
was
bad
and
should
be
prohibited.
this
is...
it
is
also
true
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
true,
they
did
not
do
that
here
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
did,
only
that,
uniquely
among
the
rules
that
this
court
has
established
in
the
antitrust
area,
this
rule
has
received
the
repeated
attention
of
congress;
and
so
the
court's
deference
to
congress
and
reluctance
to
overturn
the
rule
should
be
at
its
peek
as
compared
with
those
other
rules.
and
third,
price
is
different.
this
court
has
said
that
price
competition
is
the
central
nervous
system
of
the
economy.
other
restraints,
to
be
sure,
might
indirectly
affect
price,
but
not
with
the
same
absolute
force.
territorial
restraints
don't
absolutely
prevent
price
competition
because
customers
can
travel
or
order
by
phone,
mail,
or
internet,
and
indeed
under
territorial
restraints
there
are
often
multiple
retailers
in
a
particular
territory
who
can
compete.
maximum
price
maintenance
doesn't
prevent
competition
at
all
unless,
as
the
court
noted
in
khan,
it's
really
minimum
resale
price
maintenance
in
disguise,
in
which
case
the
court
in
khan
said
it's
illegal.
manufacturers
can
of
course
pay
retailers
for
the
services
that
enhance
the
product
that
are
being
advanced
as
the
pro-competition
benefit
of
resale
price
maintenance.
but
the
question
for
this
court
is
whether
the
manufacturer
should
be
allowed
to
use
a
price-fixing
agreement
to
make
that
payment
to
buy
those
services,
and
that's
not
a
question
of
fact
for
a
jury
to
decide
in
a
rule
of
reason
trial.
that's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
for
this
court.
it's
a
question
really
of
what
kind
of
currency
a
manufacturer
can
use
to
buy
those
retailer
services.
it's
also
true
that
the
claim
that
price-fixing
works
to
induce
those
services
is
both
debatable
and
untested.
the
retailers
have
no
obligations
to
provide
services
under
the
retail
price
maintenance
agreement
at
issue
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
you
could.
you
could
also
require
those
things
without
resale
price
maintenance
and
then
the
retailer
would
be
free
to
decide
to
raise
the
price
to
pay
for
that
or
to
provide
it
so
efficiently
that
he
could
in
effect
engage--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that
really
depends,
doesn't
it,
on
what
the
consumers
in
the
market
want,
and
if
it's
correct,
if
the
manufacturer...
if
the
claim
on
behalf
of
the
manufacturer
here
is
correct
that
what
the
customers
want
is
service,
the
retailers
are
in
at
least
as
good
a
position
to
identify
that
fact
as
not.
i
think
the
point--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
that's
at
its
peak,
perhaps,
when
you're
talking
about
electronics.
when
the
shopping
experience
alone
is
what
is
thought
to
be
the
benefit,
which
is
often
the
case,
you
can't
free
ride
on
that.
you
either
shop
in
the
place
where
you
like
to
shop
or
you
shop...
or
you
have
a
different
shopping
experience
in
target.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
there
is.
the
manufacturer
can
contract
for
it.
the
manufacturer
can
decline
to
deal
with
people
who
don't
provide
it.
the
very
same
point
that
was
being
made
earlier.
i
think
that
the
point
here
is
that
permitting
resale
price
maintenance
would
be
such
a
drastic
change
in
the
longstanding
settled
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act
that
it
doesn't
really
qualify
as
the
kind
of
common
law
evolution
that
this
court
has
said
is
appropriate
ordinarily
in
making
antitrust
rules
under
the
sherman
act.
if
that
change
is
to
be
made
at
all,
it
should
be
made
by
congress
and
not
by
this
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
there
was
such
a
period.
and
this
court
noted
that
fact
in--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
was
a
legislative
expression
of
position
on
this
particular
issue.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that
is...
the
solicitor
general
is
no
longer
barred
from
making
that
argument,
as
is
evidenced
today.
what
he--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
i
think
congress
found
it
unnecessary
or
perhaps
questioned
the
wisdom
or
constitutionality
of
barring
the
solicitor
general
from
making
particular
arguments.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
congress
has
consistently...
well,
and
the
repeal...
the
reason
the
repeal
of
the
miller-tydings
act
seems
particularly
relevant
is
that
it
is
indeed...
it
was
an
amendment
to
this
statute
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
interpret,
so
it
sheds
some
light
on
the
on
the
meaning
of
this
statute
as
it
stands.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
but
when
congress
repealed
that,
there
were
considerable...
there
was
considerable
expression
of
legislative
history,
for
those
who
find
legislative
history
helpful,
that
declared
opposition
to
resale
price
maintenance,
not
simply
that
it
was
sometimes
helpful
and
sometimes
hurtful.
so
to
the
extent
congress's
intent
can
be
gleaned
from
that
legislative
history,
it
was
an
intent
to
return
to
the
regime
of
per
se
illegality.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
has,
but
i
would
question
the
wisdom
of
that
technique
as
a
method
of
expressing
congress's
views.
the
fact
that
congress
went
so
far
as
to
use
it
once
suggests
a
very
strong
view
indeed.
