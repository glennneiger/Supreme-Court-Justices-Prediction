mr.
james
w.
dabney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
very
broadly
worded
patent
claim,
claim
4
of
the
engelgau
patent,
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
united
states
patent
and
trademark
office
have
both
told
this
court
is
invalid
under
section
103
of
the
patent
act
and
was
issued
in
error.
the
federal
circuit's
vacatur
of
summary
judgment
in
this
case
is
grounded
in
a
judicially
devised
test
that
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
case
is
in
litigation
at
this
point,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
patent
litigation
district
courts
are
vested
with
authority
and
this
court
is
vested
with
authority
to
render
a
judgment
of
invalidity
under
section
282
of
the
patent
act.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
there
is
the
possibility
of
director-initiated
re-examination
of
patents
as
certainly
an
administrative
remedy
that
does
exist.
but
where
a
case
is
in
pending
litigation
such
as
this,
the
traditional
way
that
these
disputes
are
resolved
is
for
a
court
to
apply
the
law
to
the
facts
and
render
a
judgment
on
a
defense
of
invalidity
which
has
been
pleaded
to
the
plaintiff's
claim
of
patent
infringement
in
this
case.
this
issue
arises
in
the
context
of
a
defense
pleaded
to
a
claim
for
patent
infringement
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
patent
office
really
could
swoop
in
and
cut
off
the
plaintiff's
claim
in
the
manner
your
honor
is
suggesting.
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
applied
the
approach
it's
applied
in
previous
cases,
which
is
a
categorical
approach.
the
federal
circuit
says
that
no
matter
what
might
be
the
nature
of
an
alleged
invention
or
improvement,
no
matter
how
broad
might
be
a
claim
made
in
an
issued
patent,
no
matter
how
small
might
be
the
difference
between
a
patent
claim
and
prior
art,
and
no
matter
how
modest
might
have
been
the
degree
of
skill
needed
to
devise
subject
matter
described
by
a
patent
claim,
the
federal
circuit
says
regardless
of
any
or
all
of
that
a
court
of
the
united
states
can
never,
ever
sustain
a
defense
of
invalidity
under
section
103
of
the
patent
act
except
in
a
very
limited
and
narrowly
defined
circumstance.
that
circumstance
is
a
record
that
includes
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
yields
a
jury
verdict
or
specific
finding
showing
what
the
federal
circuit
calls
a
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation
to
combine
prior
art
teachings
in
the
particular
manner
claimed
by
the
patent
at
issue.
the
decision
in
this
case
treats
section
103
not,
as
this
court
has
said,
as
a
codification
of
a
condition
for
patentability
whose
benchmark
is
skill
and
ingenuity.
the
decision
in
this
case
treats
section
1
as
implementing
a
supposed
entitlement
to
patent
protection
that
a
court--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done
in
recent
times
has
been
after
a
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
erect
a
series
of
escape
devices
from
what
is
otherwise
a
categorical
test
that
must
be
imposed
in
all
cases.
as
a
practical
matter
the
federal
circuit
still
characterizes
as
an
issue
of
fact
for
determination
by
a
jury
the
presence
or
absence
of
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation,
and
so
these
seemingly
remedial
steps
that
have
been
taken
by
the
federal
circuit
do
not
materially
affect
the
problem
that's
praised
by
this
case,
which
is
the
well
nigh
impossibility
nowadays
of
being
able
to
have
an
efficient,
inexpensive,
quick
and
predictable
determination
of
whether
claimed
subject
matter
meets
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
statute
and
this
court's
precedents
make
the
benchmark
of
patentability
skill,
what
degree
of
skill
is
needed
to
devise
subject
matter
in
respect
to
an
objectively
defined
problem,
objective
looking
at
the
claim
and
looking
at
the
prior
art?
what
the
federal
circuit
is
talking
about
now
is
an
inquiry
into
motivation,
not
skill.
those
two
are
very
different
concepts.
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
court's
precedents
that
says
that
whether
a
patent
should
be
granted
or
not
depends
on
whether
a
hypothetical
person
had
hypothetical
motivation
to
do
what
everybody
knows
he
could
do.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
needs
to
be
very
clear
what
is
meant
by
the
term
"hindsight".
if
by
hindsight
is
meant
looking
at
what's
claimed
now,
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented,
and
comparing
that
to
the
prior
art,
to
call
that
analytical
process
improper
hindsight
is
to
make
a
frontal
assault
on
the
statute
itself.
if
by
hindsight
means
to
posit
a
desired
result,
a
clay
doorknob,
and
to
ask
whether
more
skill
and
ingenuity
than
were
required
by
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
was
needed
to
do
that,
to
say
that
that
constitutes
improper
hindsight
is
to
make
a
frontal
assault
on
the
entire
body
of
this
court's
precedents
construing
section
103
and
its
common
law
predecessors.
with
regard
to
the
kind
of
bias
your
honor
is
talking
about,
this
court's
precedents
provide
a
wealth
of
mechanisms
for
protecting
against
that,
including
the
statement
towards
the
end
of
the
graham
opinion,
which
is
the
only
source
of
the
word
"hindsight"
that
i've
seen
cited
in
the
amici
brief,
which
was
a
discussion
of
the
secondary
consideration.
so
that
in
a
case
like
goodyear
against
rayovac
there's
an
excellent
case
where
the
claimed
subject
matter
seems
so
simple
in
hindsight.
this
was
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1944.
a
leakproof
battery
that
had
been
a
problem
that
had
defied
solution
for
years
and
there
was
all
kinds
of
motivation
to
solve
it,
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
solved
was
considered
important
by
this
court
in
sustaining
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
that
case,
which
claimed
nothing
more
than
a
sheet
metal
sheath
wrapped
around
the
electrodes
and
materials
generated
in
the
battery.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
winslow.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
the
best
i
think
anybody
could
do
would
be
to
look
at
the
opinion
in
this
case
and
try
to
figure
that
out.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
in
this
case
what
the
respondents
is
mr.
engelgau
would
have
had
no
motivation
to
look
to
the
asano-designed
pedal
because
he
was
trying
to
meet
the
requirements
of
fort
motor
company
and
asano
would
not
have
met
those
requirements
and
therefore
mr.
engelgau
would
have
had
no
motivation
to
start
with
asano.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
respectfully
suggest--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
believe
if
you
study
carefully
this
court's
precedence,
including
graham
itself
and
just
about
every
other
case
this
court
has
ever
decided,
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
measure,
what
our
society
agreed
to
pay
off
on
is
subject
matter
that
reflects
a
certain
degree
of
skill.
and
this
court
has
rejected
time
and
time
again
the
notion
that
someone
who
was
the
first
simply
to
take
advantage
of
the
known
capability
of
technology
was
entitled
to
a
patent.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
certainly.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the...
the
presence
or
absence
of
motivation
to
devise
something.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
is
in
a
special
sense.
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done
is
has,
it
has
attributed
controlling
significance
to
what
is
in
most
cases
at
best
a
factor,
and
in
fact
is
nothing
more
than
a
legal
argument
about
the
preemptive
effect
of
prior
art.
the
motivation
debate
in
this
case
is
all
about
what
is
the
preemptive
legal
effect
of
the
asano
reference.
it
either
invalidates
the
claim--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i
would
agree
that
if
there
is--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--well,
the
test,
i
mean
in
this
case,
the
specific
claim
at
issue
in
this
case
is
very
analogous
to
the
claim
that
this
court
considered
in
the
anderson's-black
rock
case.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
no
dispute
as
to
any
of
the
factual
inquiries
that
have
traditionally
defined
patent
validity
analysis.
the
prior
art
that
we
rely
on,
it's
undisputed
that
it's
prior
art
and
it's
in
the
record.
the
level
of
skill
is
undisputed.
the
quantum
of
difference
between
the
claimed
subject
matter
and
the
prior
art
is
undisputed.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
legal
consequences
follow
from
that.
what
question
do
you
ask
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
difference
adds
up
to
a
patentable
invention?
it's
very
analogous
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
anderson's-black
rock
case.
anderson's-black
rock
was
a
case
like
this
in
which
someone
had
invented
a
radiant
heat
burner
and
the
patentee
in
that
case
had
seen
that
there
was
a
market
for
using
that
by
attaching
it
to
an
asphalt
spreader.
so
the
patent
claim
in
that
case
was
taking
someone
else's
invention,
the
radiant
heat
burner
and
hanging
it
on
a
standard
painting
apparatus
and
using
it
for
its,
one
of
its
marketable
purposes.
this
court
held
in
this,
in
the
anderson's-black
rock
case
that
the
patentee
had
not
done
anything
patentable
in
that
case.
all
he
had
done
was
take
a
burner
that
functioned
as
a
burner,
and
a
spreader
that
functioned
as
a
spreader,
and
the
two
components
did
not
affect
one
another's
operation
at
all.
it
was
in
the
parlance
of
this
court's
precedents,
an
aggregation.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
if
the
patentee
in
that
case--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--well,
actually
in
that
case
there
actually
was
quite
a
story.
in
that
case
there
was
a
story
that
for
years
and
years
you'd
had
this
cold
joint
problem
of
laying
successive
courses
of
asphalt
blacktop,
and...
and
this
guy
actually
saw
something
that
was
interesting,
that
you
could
use
this
radiant
heat
burner
to
solve
the
asphalt
blacktop
problem.
that
was
not
what
he
claimed,
though.
what
he
claimed
was
an
apparatus
that
just
had
these
two
things
together,
and
they
didn't
interact
with
one
another
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
both
put
in
the
same
shopping
bag.
and
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
we
have
an
adjustable
pedal
assembly
that
does
whatever--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--well,
the,
on
this
record,
and
even
if
you
take
at
face
value
what's
said
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case,
which
is
very
largely
not
based
on
the
record,
the
story
is,
from
mr.
engelgau
is,
ford
motor
company
had
a
particular
requirement
and
mr.
engelgau
sat
down
to
design
to
it.
he
to
design
a
pedal
that
had
would
meet
ford's
requirements
and
one
way
that
he
did
that
was
to
come
up
with
the
kind
of
pedal
assembly
that's
shown
in
the
figures
of
the
patent.
but
we
are
not
here
talking
about
the
patentability
of
the
figures
of
the
patent.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
patentability
of
claims
1,
2
or
3
of
the
patent;
we
are
talking
about
claim
4
in
which
these
respondents
got
a
little
greedy.
claim
4
describes
almost
nothing--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--we
take
no
position
on
that.
they're
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
would
have
no
opinion
on
that
question.
[laughter]
i
could
stand
here
and
make
arguments.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
here's
the--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--well,
because...
because--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--here's
the
reason.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
here's
the
reason.
what's
shown
in
the
figures
of
the
engelgau
patent
is
an
adjustable
pedal
assembly
that
has
a
large
bore
tube
from
which
you
suspended
a
pedal
arm
on
a
yoke,
and
it
slides
back
and
forth
along
the
tube.
and
that's
the
way
that
it
provides
for
adjustment.
and
in
claims
1,
2
and
3
some
of
that
structure
is
recited.
so
those
claims
would
not
necessarily
be
invalid
by
the
asano
reference
because
the
asana
adjustment
mechanism
doesn't
use
a
tube,
and
doesn't
use
a
yoke;
it
uses
pins
and
slots
and
it
provides
adjustment
by
a
different
mechanism.
the
respondents
have
not
asserted
claims
1,
2
and
3
in
this
case
because
those
claims
don't
describe
anything
remotely
like
the
petitioner's
pedals.
they
limited
their
claim
to
claim
4
because
only
by
claiming
this
enormous
verbal
abstraction
that
is
claim
4
can
they
make
a
colorable
claim
of
patent
infringement
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
so
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
does
not
need
to
decide
whether
1,
2
or
3
would
be
valid
but
the
point
would
be,
the
question
would
be
what
we
did
in
the
hotchkiss
case
or
in
the
anderson's-black
rock
case
or
any
of
these
cases.
would
it
have
required
more
than
ordinary
skill
to
devise
that
claim
structure
with
those
additional
structural
limitations
to
solve
some
objectively
defined
problem,
and
that
hasn't
been
litigated
or
briefed.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
conceivably.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
someone
who
tries
patent
cases,
there
is
no
legal
regime
that
is
a
greater
generator
of
patent
litigation
than
the
teaching
suggestion
motivation
test
that
is
urged
by
the
respondent.
where
in
this
unbelievable
situation
where,
in
the
district
court,
this
court's
precedents
were
cited,
were
not
followed.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court's
precedents
in
anderson's-black
rock
and
others
were
cited,
not
distinguished,
followed
at
all.
if
the
law
of
this
court
had
been
applied
in
the
district
court
i
wouldn't
be
standing
here
right
now.
the
reason
that
we
have
this,
this
proceeding
going
on
is
because
of
this
extraordinary
situation,
where
notwithstanding
that
this
court
has
issued
precedents
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
dealing
with
multiple
technologies,
lots
of
different
kinds
of
differences,
lots
of
different
kinds
of
alleged
innovation,
they
are
simply
not
paid
attention
to
in
the
corpus
of
the
federal
circuit's
case
law
up
until
about
a
month
ago.
so
the,
this
court
could
do
no
greater
service
to
the
actual
process
of
determining
whether
claimed
subject
matter
does
and
does
not
comply
with
the
statute
than
to
decide
with
case.
the
worst
possible
thing
that
can
happen
in
this
case
is
for
the
case
not
to
end
here,
and
for
the
court
not
to
provide
a
precedent
as
it
has
done
in
so
many
particular
past
cases,
and
give
the
public
an
example
of
a
particular
claim
and
a
particular
difference
that
does
not
meet
the
standard.
what's
made
clear
throughout
the
history
of
patent
decisionmaking
is
that
no
verbal
formula
is
ever
going
to
get
you
there.
what
we
have
as
a
functional
approach;
it's
not
as
opposing
counsel
suggests...
is
"it"
apparent,
is
"it"
obvious,
would
it
have
been
obvious
to
do
"it"?
what
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
again
starting
with
the
doorknob
case
in
1851
is
to
pose
a
problem.
would
it
have--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--that's
not,
if
you
read
the
affidavits
carefully
that
is
not
an
accurate
characterization
of...
of
any
evidence
put
in
by
the
petitioner.
that
was
an
argument--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--that
would
be,
to
the
extent
that
that...
if
that
is
established
that
could
be
taken
into
consideration
along
with
other
facts.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
what
the
statute
calls
for,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
to
focus
on
a
particular
subjective
problem
like
fitting
into
a
ford
f
350,
or
particular
difference
between
a
prior
art
pedal
that
provides
wire
chafing
and
a
claimed
invention.
the
law
has
always
required
that
the
patentability
be
determined
by
the
smallest
amount
of
difference.
so
if
it
were
true
that
there
was
wire
chafing,
that
that
was
a
problem
that
would
have
had
to
have
been
overcome,
if
you
started
with
a
prior
art
pedal
that,
that
provided
for
wires
to
move...
well
then,
maybe
that
combination
would
not
make
the
claimed
subject
matter
obvious.
but
that
would
not
foreclose
the
defendant
from
saying
well,
this
other
technology
over
here
that
doesn't
suffer
from
that
problem,
it's
a
simple
matter
to
modify
that,
so
the
premise
of
the
question,
that
because
there
is
some
other
potential
combination
that
might
have
been,
might
have
been
more
difference
or
less
reason
to
modify
it
than
the
one
that's
relied
on
by
the
petitioner,
is
legally
not
material
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
so
i
respectfully
submit
that
the...
i
really
have
to
emphasize
this.
i
mean,
this
is
a
litigation
between,
you
know,
two
real
businesses.
the
justified
expectations,
justice
souter
that
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again,
are
the
expectations
of
real
innovators,
who
make
real
products
and
have
real
inventions.
and...
and
i
think
it
would
come
as
a
great
surprise
to
the
owner
of
the
asano
patent
to
find
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
that
in
order
to
supply
it
to
a
modern
vehicle
maker
it
would
have
to
pay
tribute
to
the
engelgau
patent.
thank
you.
