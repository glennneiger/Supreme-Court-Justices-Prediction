mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
construed
as
the
sole
means
of
proving
obviousness
the
teaching
suggestion
motivation
test
is
contrary
to
the
patent
act,
irreconcilable
with
this
court's
precedents
and
bad
policy.
it
asks
the
wrong
question
and
in
cases
like
this
one,
it
produces
the
wrong
answer.
it
should
be
rejected
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
not
entirely
clear,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
sometimes
difficult
to
distinguish,
certainly
between
motivation
and
suggestion.
one
way
in
which
it
is
used
for
example,
is
if
there
were
some
indication
in
the
prior
art
that
doing
something
a
certain
way
might
save
money
and
then
there
would
be
a
motivation
to
save
money,
which
might
supply
the
requisite
motivation
for
combining
the
two
prior
art
references.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
teaching
suggestion
and
motivation
are
valid
means
of
proving
obviousness,
valid
considerations
for
the
court.
and
this
court's
precedents
are
entirely
consistent
with
that.
a
number
of
cases
cited
by
respondent
show
that
the
court
has
looked
to
suggestion
as
a
means
to
determining
whether
a
patent
is
obvious.
the
problem
with
the
federal
circuit's
test
is
it
makes
that
the
exclusive
test
and
precludes
obviousness
determinations
in
the
absence
of
satisfaction
of
that
test
which
this
court's
precedents
are
clearly
not
consistent
with.
in
fact
in
graham
itself,
in
the
sakraida
case,
in
dann
against
johnston,
lower
courts
had
held
patents
valid
because
of
a
lack
of
suggestion.
this
court
reversed
without
requiring
or
even
addressing
the
question
whether
there
was
some
explicit
principle
that
had
been
proven
by
the
party
challenging
the
patent,
by
clear
evidence
that
there
was
such
a
teaching
suggestion
motivation.
it's
just
foreign
to
this
court's
precedents
as
a
mandatory
prerequisite
for
obviousness.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
several
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
of
course,
there
can
be
no
legitimate
reliance
in
lower
court
precedent
that's
contrary
to
supreme
court
precedent,
and
it
was
an
open
secret
in
the
patent
bar
that
the
approach
being
taken
by
the
federal
circuit
was
inconsistent
with
cases
such
as
this
court's
sakraida
decision.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
i
just
think
it
would
be
dangerous
proposition
for
this
court
to
endorse
that
line
of
argumentation
but
even
leaving
that
aside,
it's
not
justified
here
on
the
facts.
and
this
patent
is
a
good
example.
no
one
is
suggesting
that
claims
1
through
3
are
invalid;
the
problem
here
is
that
claim
4
sweeps
so
broadly,
so
much
broader
than
what
the
applicant
in
fact
invented,
that
it
sweeps
in
obvious
manifestations.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
are
claims
at
the
outer
boundaries
of
patentability,
even
under
the
federal
circuit's
test.
and
in
those
cases
there
will
no
doubt
be
some
claims,
such
as
the
claim
in
this
case
that
can
be
resolved
at
summary
judgment
by
a
court,
that
the
court
can
simply
determine
as
a
matter
of
law,
it's
obvious.
whereas
under
the
federal
circuit's
test
it
has
to
go
to
a
jury
and
the
somewhat
unpredictable,
at
the
least--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i
think
the
"sufficiently
innovative"
is
more
of
a
description
rather
than
a
test;
it's
a
description
of
what
this
court
said
in
graham.
in
graham
itself
the
court
laid
out
the
proper
analysis
which
is
you
need
to
consider
in
detail,
not
in
the
more
cursory
fashion
that
the
federal
circuit's
test
encourages,
but
in
detail
the
capabilities
of
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
and
the
content
of
the
prior
art
and
the
differences
between
the
prior
art
and
the
invention,
and
ascertain...
it's
ultimately
a
legal
judgment
informed
by
those
detailed
factual
inquiries,
whether
it
is
obvious
or
nonobvious
and
entitled
to
patent
protection.
and
in
addition
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
in
sakraida
provided
a
framework
for
assessing
patents
like
this
one,
where
each
of
the
elements
is
set
forth
in
the
prior
art
and
each
of
the
elements
in
the
claimed
invention
is
merely
performing
its
already
known,
previously
known
function
as
set
forth
in
the
prior
art.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
make
sense
because
the
statute
requires
it,
and
as
a
practical
matter
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
only
category
of
cases
in
which
the
result
would
change
under
our
test
is
the
category
in
which
as
a
matter
of
law,
in
light
of
the
factual
issues
that
are
required
under
graham,
as
a
matter
of
law
the
court
concludes
that
the
difference
between
the
claimed
invention
and
the
prior
art
is
so
trivial
that
it
cannot
be
given
the
protection
of
a
patent.
and
in
those
circumstances
the
presumption
doesn't
come
into
play.
it's
a
legal
determination;
the
presumption
has
been
understood
to
effect
the
burden
of
proof,
and
in
the
federal
circuit's
view
the
measure
of
the
burden
of
proof
requiring
clear
and
convincing
evidence
on
the
underlying
factual
considerations,
not
the
ultimate
legal
determination.
but
one
of
the
problems
with
the
federal
circuit's
test
is
that
it
transforms
what
this
court
made
clear
in
graham
is
supposed
to
be
a
legal
determination.
ultimately
it
transforms
it
into
a
jury
question.
because
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
you
have
as
conclusory
affidavits
from
respondent's
experts
saying
"oh,
this
would
not
have
been
obvious.
"
and
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
view
is
enough
to
create
a
jury
question
and
then
you
then
have
to
roll
the
dice
in
front
of
a
jury
in
each
one
of
these
cases,
except
of
course
the
many
cases
in
which
the
challenger
can't
meet
the
teaching
suggestion
motivation
test
at
all
and
simply
is
unable
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
patent,
notwithstanding
this
court's
holding
in
graham
that
it's
ultimately
a
legal
determination...
admittedly
one
informed
by
detailed
factual
inquiries.
another
problem
with
the
federal
circuit's
test
is
that
it
devalues
and
de-emphasizes
the
statutory
focus
and
this
court's
focus
in
graham
on
the
capabilities
of
the
person
of
ordinary
skill.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
haven't
suggested
an
innovation
test,
your
honor.
we
were
simply
attempting
to
describe
in
perhaps
imprecise
terms
the
holding
of
this
court
in
graham,
and
the
holding
of
this
court
in
graham
is
that
the
ultimate
inquiry
for
the
court,
obviously
suggestion,
teaching,
motivation,
teaching
a
way
in
the
prior
art,
all
of
these
are
factual,
subsidiary
factual
issues
that
will
shed
light
and
a
great
deal
of
light
on
the
ultimate
question
in
each
particular
case,
but
ultimately
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
in
light
of
all
those
underlying
factual
showings
the
differences
between
the
claimed
invention
and
the
prior
art
are
sufficient
to,
that
they
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
and
that
ultimately
is
a
legal
determination,
you
can
refer
to
that
as
sufficiently
innovative
to
justify
a
patent,
but
the
ultimate
question,
the
ultimate
test
is
the
one
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
in
the
graham
decision.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
would
have
been
obvious
for
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
to
take
the
asano
patent,
add
the
sensor,
the
electronic
sensor
in
a
manner
that
that
off-the-shelf
sensor
is
designed
to
be
added,
and
voila,
you
have
a
winning
combination.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
those
have
not
been
litigated.
those
have
additional
limitations
that
are
not
present
in
claim
4
that,
depending
on
what
the
prior
art
might
reveal
about
those,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
they
would
or
would
not
be
obvious
because
obviously,
that
question
has
not
been
litigated.
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
would
suggest
they
are
obvious.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
number
one,
the
conclusory
assertion
that
an
invention
is
nonobvious,
just
like
the
assertion
that
it's
obvious
from
an
expert,
should
have
no
weight
because
of
course--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
again,
it's
a
legal
question.
and
moreover
and
more
importantly,
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
analysis,
one
problem,
and
with
the
experts'
analysis,
is
that
they're
focusing
on
the
narrow
definition
of
the
quote
unquote
problem
by
looking
only
at
what
this
particular
inventor
was
trying
to
solve,
but
the
scope
of
the
claim
is
far
broader.
thank
you.
