mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
court
will
want
to
have
available
to
it
the
red
brief
and
also
this
big,
which
is
the
supplemental
joint
appendix
which
has
some
of
the
patents
in
it,
and
i'm
going
to
quote
from
both
of
them.
i
think
you
can't
understand
what
motivation
means
and
what
the
whole
test
that
the
federal
circuit
is
employing
means--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--without--
[laughter]
--without
starting
from
the
statute
itself.
and
so
i
want
to
start
with
the
statutory
text
and
use
that
as
the
jumping
off
point
like
the
court
of
appeals
has
for
the
inquiry
that
it's
asking.
it's
reproduced
at
page
21
of
the
red
brief.
and
congress
said
it's
the
first
blocked
quote,
that
a
patent
may
not
be
obtained
though
the
invention
is
not
identically
disclosed
or
described,
as
set
forth
in
section
102
of
this
title.
those
are
the
other
requirements
for
giving
a
patent.
if
the
differences
between
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented
and
the
prior
art
are
such
that
the
subject
matter
as
a
whole
would
have
been
obvious
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
so
the
term
of
art
here
is
obvious,
and
the
plain
meaning
of
obvious,
if
you
understand
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
obvious
or
if
you
think
that
the,
what
the
federal
circuit
means
by
its
test
is
not
obvious,
is
something
that's
either
apparent
or
not
apparent,
and
that's
what
the
federal
circuit
is
asking.
it
says
look,
take
the
invention
and
see
whether
or
not
it
was
apparent
or
not
apparent,
and
what
the
federal...
to
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
at
the
time
of
the
invention.
and
what
the
federal
circuit
says
is,
we
want
to
be
inclusive.
the
other
side
takes
these
words,
teaching,
suggestion,
motivation,
as
if
they
were
words
of
limitation
rather
than
these
words
of
inclusion.
and
what
the
federal
circuit
has
said
is
what
we
mean
by
teaching
a
suggestion
or
a
motivation,
and
it
can
be
explicit
or
implicit,
is
anything
that
would
have
made
this
invention
apparent
to
a
practitioner
at
the
time.
that's
what
it's
after.
it
wants
to
know,
look,
was
it
apparent
to
someone
else,
a
practitioner
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
engelgau
to
take
asano
and
put
the
electronic
throttle
control
on
pin--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
do
say
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
understand.
can
i
take
you
to
their,
the
federal
circuit's
answer?
it's
two
pages
before
the
quote
that
i
just
gave
you,
page
19,
there's
another
blocked
quote.
the
federal
circuit
has
explained
what
it's
talking
about
when
it
means
a
motivation.
they
say
that
they
have
repeatedly
held
that
there
is
an
implicit
motivation
to
combine.
it
exists
not
only
when
a
suggestion
may
be
gleaned
from
the
prior
art
as
a
whole,
that's
a
teaching,
but
when
the
improvement
is
technology
independent
and
the
combination
of
references
results
in
a
product
or
process.
and
these
are
common
motivations.
you
would
do
it
because
it's
more
desirable
because
it's
stronger,
cheaper,
faster,
lighter,
smaller,
more
durable,
more
efficient.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
for
a
practitioner,
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
justice
breyer,
you
don't
understand.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
question
is
not...
i
can
illustrate
it
with
this
case.
the
question
is
not
do
you
want
more
efficient
pedals.
if
that's
the
test,
then
everything
is
obvious
because
we
always
want
more
efficient
pedals,
justice,
and
i'll
come
back
to
this.
it's
always
going
to
be
the
case
that
if
your
test
is
capability,
every
patent
including
the
first
three
claims
of
this
one
is
going
to
be
obvious,
because
you're
always
capable
of
assembling
a
pedal.
what
it
says,
what
the
federal
circuit
says,
is
there
a
motivation
to
make
this
invention?
was
there
motivation,
and
this
was
the
heart
of
the
federal
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case,
their
theory
is
that
asano
renders
our
patent
obvious.
and
the
federal
circuit
said
all
right,
what's
the
motivation
to
take
asano
and
take
the
electronic
throttle
control
and
make
it
responsive--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
a
particular
place,
yes,
that's
correct.
justice
scalia,
the
reason
these
federal
circuit
judges
were
right
notwithstanding
your
correct
point
which
is,
just
to
be
clear,
our
invention
is
not
limited
to
asano.
our
invention
takes
any
fixed
pivot
adjustable
pedal
and
any
electronic
throttle
control
and
says
combine
it
in
a
particular
way.
the
federal
circuit's
point
is
their
motion
rests
on
asano.
the
other
side's
theory
is,
we've
got
this
invention,
engelgau.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
nobody
did
anything
like
this
for
10
years.
the
other
side
comes
back
and
says
yes,
that
it
would
have
been
obvious
to
somebody
who
had
an
asano
to
do
the
same
thing
basically.
and
so
the
federal
circuit
said
okay,
show
us.
if
this
isn't
going
to
be
hindsight,
where
we
just
give
you
the
invention
and
you
just
say
oh,
i
could
have
done
that,
they
say
give
us
any
evidence
that
someone
would
have
done
what
you
say,
which
is
take
asano,
it's
their
argument,
asano--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you'll
have
to
ask
them,
justice
scalia.
they
filed
a
motion
that
it
was
obvious.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
the
patent
examiner
gave
us
a
patent,
initially
rejected
this
patent
as
obvious,
decided
that
it
wasn't
after
considering
all
of
these
things,
a
statutory
presumption
of
validity
attached
under
section
282.
so
we
have
what
we
say
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
the
question
isn't
presented
here,
but
whatever.
the
other
side
comes
in
and
tries
to
knock
our
patent
out.
they
file
a
motion,
and
the
motion
rests
on
a
piece
of
prior
art.
and
so
what
the
federal
circuit
said
is,
if
we're
not
going
to
knock
all
of
these
patents
out
by
hindsight,
all
we
want
to
know
is
one
thing
and
you
know,
on
remand,
they
may
well
be
able
to
prove
it.
we
don't
think
they
can.
but
all
it's
asking
for
is
for
the
district
court
to
make
a
finding
that
says
the
other
side
is
right,
that
it
would
have
been
obvious
to
take
asano,
which
is
their
only
example,
and
combine
it
with
electronic
throttle
control
in
this
way.
that
is
what's
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
let
me
answer
it
in
a
few
different
ways
because
i
want
to
again
specify
and
make
clear
what
it
is
that
the
federal
circuit
says
is
included
within
teaching,
suggestions,
motivations.
then
i
want
to
turn
to
our
invention
and
the
affidavits
in
the
case.
the
federal
circuit
has
said,
and
i'll
just...
you
can
come
back
to
it
for
future
reference.
it's
recorded
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
of
our
brief.
common
sense,
common
knowledge,
common
understandings
are
all
included
within
teaching,
suggestions
or
motivations.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
it
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
i
could
just
clarify,
dystar--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
i
agree
that
you
have
to
distinguish
two
things
rightly.
the
first
is
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
exists
now,
and
that's
what
we
ask
you
to
affirm.
and
that
is,
the
federal
circuit
has
made
quite
clear
that
its
test
is
inclusive,
and
we
think
that
that
establishes
that
it's
not
necessary
to
add
some
new
sort
of
undetermined
test
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree
for
the
following
reasons,
and
that
is:
what
the
federal
circuit
is
saying
is
that
any
amount
of
evidence,
any
form
of
evidence
is
relevant
to
answer
a
particular
question.
we
have
a
question
that
we
want
answered.
they
have
a
question
they
want
answered.
their
question,
the
petitioner
at
least,
i'm
not
sure
about
the
solicitor
general,
the
petitioner's
standard
is,
was
somebody
capable
of
doing
this?
we
have
a
different
question.
would
it
have
been
apparent
to,
and
that's
what
we
think
the
text
requires,
would
it
have
been
apparent
to
a
practitioner
of
the
art?
and
so
the
federal
circuit
is
saying
whatever
evidence
you
want
to
bring
to
bear--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
i
don't.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
that's
right.
and
what
the
federal
circuit
is
saying,
you
have...
what
it's
saying
is,
if
you
just
look
to
capability,
and
that
is,
could
you
put
asano
together
on
pin
54,
you
will
miss
the
most
important
part
of
invention.
and
that
is,
invention
isn't
at
the
end
when
you
put
the
two
things
together.
invention
is
finding
the
problem,
deciding
what
pieces
of
the
prior
art
to
use,
and
deciding
how
to
put
them
together.
everybody
is
always
capable
of,
it
will
always
be
the
case,
i
think,
that
a
practitioner
of
the
art
can
put
them
together.
remember
the
very
point
of
a
patent,
when
you
look
at
our
patent
at
the
end
of
the
case,
we
were
required
to
explain
it
in
great
detail.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
that's
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
with
respect,
that
is
not
a
fair
description
of
the
federal
circuit's
test,
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
language
that
addressed
this
claim.
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
of
our
brief
and
also
at
the
top
of
19,
and
we
quote
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
the
solicitor
general
asserts
to
the
contrary,
that
federal
circuit
precedent
focuses
attention
exclusively
on
a
search
for
teaching,
suggestions
and
motivations
in
the
prior
art.
that
is
not
accurate.
that
was
a
quote
from
their
brief.
here
is
a
quote
from
the
solicitor
general.
it
is
from
a
new
opinion
of
the
federal
circuit,
but
it
is
quoting,
it
is
citing
a
series
of
old
opinions
from
the
federal
circuit.
under
our
nonrigid
motivation,
suggestion,
teaching
test,
a
suggestion
to
combine
need
not
be
found
in
the
prior
art.
and
then
there
is
the
blocked
quote
that
i
read
to
justice
breyer
about
making
things
cheaper,
faster,
lighter,
common
knowledge
and
common
sense.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
all
that
it
adds
is
an
analytical
framework.
it's
an
elaboration.
the
word
"obvious"--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
that
the
federal
circuit
disagrees
and
over
30
years
this
special
court
has
elaborated
this
problem...
these
judges
alone,
for
example,
have
heard
300
cases
on
nonobviousness...
is
that
we
need
a
guidance,
we
need
guidance
for
the
lower
courts.
we
need
to
focus
them
on
the
right
question,
and
for
patent
examiners
and
patent
practitioners,
and
the
right
question
is
not
is...
was
someone
merely
capable
of
putting
the
two
together.
the
right
question
is
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
have
been
apparent
at
the
time
of
the
invention
to
create
this
invention
whether
it's
through
a
teaching,
a
suggestion,
a
motivation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
or
anything
else.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
have.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
i
this
it
would
be
surprising
for
this
experienced
court
and
all
of
the
patent
bar...
remember,
every
single
major
patent
bar
association
in
the
country
has
filed
on
our
side--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
it
turns
out
that
actually
is
not
accurate.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
that
is
not
the
point
of
these
bar
associations'
either.
these
bar
associations,
including
the
american
bar
association,
the
american
intellectual
property
law
association,
have
lawyers
on
both
sides
of
all
these
cases.
they're
looking
for
a
test
that
has
balance
and
that
is
what
the
federal
circuit
has
done.
now,
let
me
just
say--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
there
is
a
big
debate
over
whether
or
not
there
is
too
much
patenting
in
this
country
and
congress
is
involved
in
the
debate.
what
i
don't
think
that
there
is
that
much
debate
about
is
whether
a
properly
applied
test
that
the
federal
circuit
has
articulated
strikes
the
right
balance,
because
that
is
why
all
of
the
patent
bar
associations
have
filed
on
our
side,
i
think,
and
that
is
it
takes
account
of
the
interests
of
both
sides
and
that
is
it
says,
you're
right,
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
overpatenting,
it
says
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
be
very
concerned
about
hindsight
determinations
of
obviousness.
but
i
do
want
to
just
step
back
and
make
a
point
about
judicial
administration.
if
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
this
court
is
that
teaching,
suggestion,
motivation
just
boils
down
into
an
inquiry
into
obviousness,
i
still
think
that
an
opinion
that
says
that
and
says
that
it,
that
this
court
believes
that
it
is
embracing
the
bottom
line
of
what
the
federal
circuit
has
been
doing,
is
the
one
that
will
be
much
better
for
the
patent
system
and
for
the
courts,
because
we
have
a
real
concern
and
that
was
articulated...
asked
about
at
least
by
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
if
you
purport
to
change
the
rules
unnecessarily,
if
you
say
we're
going
off
in
a
different
direction,
this
test
has...
underlies
160,000
patents
issued
every
year.
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
applying
a
presumption
of
validity
if
you're
saying
the
patent
examiner
applied
the
wrong
test.
and
it
will
create
genuine
dramatic
instability.
the
question
i
think
is
if
you
think
instead
that
the
teaching,
suggestion,
motivation
test
is
incomplete,
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
add
on
top
of
it,
and
that's
really
what
i
didn't
understand
from
the
first
half-hour.
if
it's
going
to
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
i
think
that's
the
dilemma
that
the
federal
circuit
has
been
facing
and
is
in
answer
to
the
criticism
of
justice
scalia
and
that
is
the
federal
circuit
isn't
trying
to
articulate
every
single
possible
thing
that
can
show
you
that
it
is
obvious.
what
it's
trying
to
do
is
focus
you
on
the
right
question.
it's
trying
to
say,
here's
the
process
of
invention:
we
have
to
figure
out
there's
a
problem.
we
have
to
figure
out
what
prior
art
you're
going
to
use.
you
have
to
figure
out
how
you're
going
to
combine
it,
and
then
you
actually
combine
it.
the
act
of
invention,
the
thing
that
is
the
discovery
that
we
want
to
encourage,
is
there
in
the
middle.
it's
picking
out
the
prior
art
and
deciding
how
to
put
it
together.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
that's
absolutely
right,
and
i
just
want
to
focus
you
on
why
it
is
you
now
think
i
lose.
we
don't
lose
because
that's
not
our
invention.
the
federal
circuit's
point
was
that
that
this
invention,
claim
4,
does
not
put
an
electronic
throttle
control
together
with
an
adjustable
pedal.
it's
do
it
in
a
particular
way.
and
let
me
take
you
in
summary
judgment
in
this
case
to
the
declarations
and
explain
why
it
is
that
the
experts
here
said
you
would
not
have
done
this.
and
i
just
have
to
urge
the
court
to
cross
the
t's
and
dot
the
i's
here
and
pay
particular
attention
to
exactly
what
it
is
that
we
claimed
and
exactly
what
it
is
that
they
said
rendered
our
patent
obvious.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
take
you
to
the
big
book
that
i
asked
you
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--page
8,
exactly.
and
that
is,
there
are
six
different
pieces
to
claim
4
and
i'm
going
to
take
you
to
the
relevant
one.
and
they
are
the
last
two
paragraphs
here.
we
claim
an
electronic
control
attached
to
the
support,
so
we
specify
where
the
electronic
control
is
going
to
be.
and
then
we
say
where,
what
that
electronic
control
is
going
to
be
responsive
to,
and
that's
the
next
paragraph:
said
apparatus
characterized
by
said
electronic
control
being
responsive
to
said
pivot,
and
that
said
pivot
is
defined
above
to
be
a
fixed
pivot.
so
here
is
the
design.
let
me
take
you
to
a
picture
if
i
could,
and
that's
going
to
be
at
the
back
of
the
red
brief.
engelgau
is
the
third
foldout
page.
it
looks
like
this.
what
we
say
is
there
is
going
to
be
a
fixed
pivot.
it's
the
red
pivot
in
our
picture,
and
there's
going
to
be
an
electronic
throttle
control.
that's
actually
on
the...
you
can't
see
it
because
you're
looking
straight
at
the
device.
that's
on
the
next
page.
it's
in
green.
there's
going
to
be
an
electronic
throttle
control
and
it's
going
to
respond
to
that
pivot.
so
we
specify
where
we're
going
to
put
the
electronic
throttle,
on
the
support.
that's
what
the
federal
circuit
recognized
was
our
invention.
now--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--all
right.
let
me,
justice
breyer.
the
experts
say
it's
not
obvious
and
the
reason
nobody
did
it
for
12
years
and
the
reason
that
asano
was
never
combined
with
an
electronic
throttle
control
is
explained
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
it's
twofold.
the
first
is,
and
i
have
to
take
you
now
to
the
picture
of
asano
because
that's
what
the
claim
that
is
supposed
to
make
our
invention
obvious
is.
they
say
you
would
have
done
this
with
asano.
what
the
experts
say
is
this
asano
thing,
no
one
would
ever
use
it
at
all.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
get--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
got
a
ph.d.
and
somebody
who
had
worked
in
pedal
design
for
25
years.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
people
who
actually
know
this
industry.
and
they,
there
are
two
things
that
come
from
the
record
in
this
case.
the
first
is
all
of
the
experts
and
engelgau
himself
testified
not
simply,
no,
this
is
not
obvious,
but
you
would
have
never
used
asano
to
solve
this
or
any
other
problem
with
an
electronic
throttle
control.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
the
way
these
cases
are
litigated,
and
properly
so,
is
the
other
side
says
this
would
be
obvious
in
light
of
a
particular
piece
or
collection
of
prior
art.
you
may
have
a
nonprior
art
motivation
to
combine
them,
but
you're
going
to
say
something
else
already
exists.
they
say
it's
asano,
and
you're
going
to
combine
it
with
something
else.
this
is
their
motion.
their
argument,
the
argument
that
was
presented
to
the
federal
circuit,
was
that
you
would
take
asano.
that's
why--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
that
is
not...
we
did
not
stick
it
on
asano.
nobody
stuck
it
on
asano.
they
picked
asano
because
it
was
the
prior
art
of
adjustable
pedal
designs.
justice
scalia,
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
correct.
even
under
a
capability
standard,
even
under
an
extraordinary
innovation
standard,
you
are
going
to
compare
something
to
prior
art.
you're
going
to
take
what
exists
now
and
compare
it
to
what
existed
before,
no
matter
what
standard
you're
employing.
and
what
they
did
is
they
compared
it
to
the
prior
art,
which
is
asano,
and
the
federal
circuit
said,
all
right,
you
want
to
say
it
will
come
from
asano.
it
would
not
come
from
asano
for
either
of
two
reasons.
the
first
is
you
would
never
use
asano.
that's
the
expert
testimony.
the
second
is
the
reason
given
by
the
pto
in
its
brief
in
this
case
and
that
is
you
wouldn't
put
it
on
the
pin
that
would
render
engelgau
obvious.
you
would
put
it
somewhere
else.
they
say
that
you
would
put
it
attached
to
a
lever
up
high.
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
two
things.
the
first
is,
though
the
federal
circuit
has
in
recent
opinions
been
quite
emphatic
about
how
inclusive
its
test
is,
it
has
consistently
cited
earlier
federal
circuit
precedent
and
said
that
the
other
side
and
the
people
who
claimed
that
their
standard
is
too
narrow
and
misguided
are
mischaracterizing
it.
and
the
second
is,
the
judgment
in
this
case
quite
explicitly
acknowledges
and
implies
the
implicit
teaching,
suggestion,
motivation
standard.
so
i
don't
want
you
to
have
the
mistaken
impression
that
there
has
been
some
radical
change
in
federal
circuit
law.
but
no
matter
what
one
thinks
about
the
differential
between
federal
circuit
law
today
and
federal
circuit
law
a
year
ago
or
two
years
ago,
there
is
a
quite
considerable
cost
by
articulating
a
desire
to
head
off
in
a
new
direction,
because
there
will
be
dramatic
instability
in
the
patent
system,
the
incalculable
investments
that
underlie
current
patents.
there
is
nothing
fundamentally
not
functional
about
how
the
federal
circuit
is
approaching
this
question.
it
has
had
decades
to
look
at
this
to
try
and
elaborate
a
standard.
this
court
in
cases
like
sakraida
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
if
you
actually
believe
that,
then
you
just
don't
believe
the
judges
in
the
federal
circuit
because
in
each
of
these
opinions
they
say
quite
explicitly
we
are
not
changing
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do
think
that
you
can
find
outliers.
i
think
that's
fair.
these
judges
as
i
said
have
heard
300
of
these
cases.
there
are
mistakes
in
the
patent
office;
there
are
mistakes
by
judges.
the
federal
circuit
explains
in
dembiczak
what
it
was
actually
looking
for
is
an
explanation.
it
wasn't
saying
that
you
had
to
use
the
prior
art,
and
it
has
tried
to
make
quite
clear
that
the
law
is
not
that
you
have
to
have
prior
art.
or
that
those
decisions
here
today.
you
can't
take,
in
a
system
that
produces
so
many
patents,
and
say
ah,
look
at
this
side
swing
patent,
or
the
garbage
bags,
and
draw
from
that
the
conclusion
that
the
system
is
fundamentally
broken.
justice
breyer,
i
meant
to
come
back
to
that.
we
can
look
through
the
studies,
we
cite
a
series
of
empirical
studies
in
our
brief
that
have
looked
at
this
problem,
the
rhetorical
claim
that
the
obviousness
rule
is
leading
to
gross
over-patenting.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
two
things.
the
first
is...
and
they
do
arise
from
the
other
side's
motion
under
asano.
first
you
wouldn't
have
chosen
asano.
the
second
is
the
federal
circuit
explained...
excuse
me,
the
solicitor
general
explains
that
you
would
have
put
the
electronic
throttle
control
somewhere
else,
technically
on
what's
called
pivot
60,
which
would
not,
would
have
rendered,
would
have
not
have
rendered
engelgau
obvious.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
the
extent
of
the
entire
invention.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
an
adjustable
pedal
that
has
a
nonmoving
pivot,
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes
it
does.
it
does.
i
promise.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
on
the
support--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
then
a
particular
kind
of
adjustable
pedal.
that's
the
state
of
the
record
so
far.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
does
the
pivot
turn?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
pivot
rotates,
but
it
doesn't...
the
difference
is
that
the
pivot
doesn't
move
with
the
adjustment
of
the
pedal.
it
spins
around,
of
course,
you
have
to
have
something
that
you
can...
but
the
prior
art,
almost
all
that
involved
a
pivot
that
when
the
pedal
moved
out,
the
electronic
throttle
control
would
go
with
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
would
be
a
motivation.
that's
absolutely
right,
why
you
would
want
to
improve
on
the
part.
the
federal
circuit
said
that
you
would
never
do
it
in
the
way
that
was
described
here.
you
may
be
able
to
prove
it
some
other
way
on
a
remand.
this
was
a
very
specific
motion,
and
the
federal
circuit
faithfully
addressed
the
claim
of
obviousness
that
was
presented
to
it.
