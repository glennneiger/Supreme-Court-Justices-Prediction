justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand,
i
think,
what
a
teaching
is.
i
take
it
a
teaching
is
you
put
all
the
prior
art...
that's
what
i
guess
that's
what
judge
rich
explained,
which
i
thought
was
very
enlightening
to
me
in
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
the
case,
wigmore,
winsmore--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--winslow.
you
put
it
all
around
the
room.
all
right,
we've
got
it
all
around
the
room,
and
i
begin
to
look
at
it
and
if
i
see
over
that
it
somehow
teaches
me
to
combine
these
two
things,
if
it
says,
breyer,
combine
this
and
that,
that's
a
teaching
and
then
it's
obvious.
now,
maybe
it
doesn't
have
the
teaching,
it
just
has
the
suggestion.
maybe
it
says,
we
suggest
you
combine
this
or
that;
okay,
then
it's
obvious.
but
i
don't
understand,
though
i've
read
it
about
15
or
20
times
now,
i
just
don't
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
term
"motivation".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
tried.
you've
read
a
lot
of
cases.
you're
a
patent
lawyer,
and
so
what
is
the
understanding
as
best
you
have
it
of
what
is
just
meant
by
the
term
"motivation"?
to
be
more
specific,
if
they
mean
motivated
to
go
look
to
the
prior
art,
well,
anybody
would
want
to
look
in
the
prior
art.
if
i
want
to
invent
something
i'll
look
anywhere.
i'll
look
to
the
prior
art.
i'll
look
to
the
library
of
congress.
i'll
look
to
my
cousin.
i
mean,
i'll
look
wherever
i
can
find
it.
so
they
can't
mean
that,
and
if
they
don't
mean
that
what
do
they
mean?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
that
again?
you
wouldn't
have
a
motivation
to
look
to
the
prior
art
to
find
your
problem.
what's
an
example
where
you
have
a
motivation
distinguishing
you
from
everybody
else?
i
mean,
everybody
has
a
motivation
to
look
to
the
prior
art.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right
person
to
ask.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
that's
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
all
it
means,
why
don't
they
say
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
what
is
this
word
that
confused
me
a
lot,
motivation?
i
found
a
lot
of
enlightenment
in
judge
rich's
idea
of
taking
all
the
relevant
art
and
putting
it
up
around
the
room
in
pictures.
and
then
i
thought,
well,
okay,
if
that
art
teaches
me
to
do
what
your
client
did,
okay,
it
doesn't.
does
it
suggest
it?
not
really.
well
then,
you
say
motivated.
where
does
that
get
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
who?
for
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
me
the
inventor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
because
otherwise--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
look
at
that
thing,
you
think
what
this
genius
did,
and
i
don't
doubt
that
he's
a
genius,
is
there
are
wheels
that
turn
around.
and
the
wheels
turn
around
to
a
fixed
proportion
to
when
you
make
the
accelerator
go
up
and
down.
now
i
think
since
high
school
a
person
has
known
that
if
you
have
three
parts
in
a
machine
and
they
each
move
in
a
fixed
ratio
one
to
the
other,
you
can
measure
the
speed
of
any
part
by
attaching
a
device
to
any
other
as
long
as
you
know
these
elementary
mathematics.
i
suppose
it
wasn't
mr.
engelgau,
it
was
probably
archimedes
that
figured
that
one
out.
so
he
simply
looks
to
something
that
moves,
and
he
sticks
a
sticker
on
it.
now
to
me,
i
grant
you
i'm
not
an
expert,
but
it
looks
at
about
the
same
level
as
i
have
a
sensor
on
my
garage
door
at
the
lower
hinge
for
when
the
car
is
coming
in
and
out,
and
the
raccoons
are
eating
it.
so
i
think
of
the
brainstorm
of
putting
it
on
the
upper
hinge,
okay?
now
i
just
think
that
how
could
i
get
a
patent
for
that,
and
that...
now
that's
very
naive,
that's
very
naive.
but
the
point
is,
i
don't
see
what
we're
talking
about,
and
what
is
supposed
to
happen
with
all
these
affidavits.
and
the...
the...
mr.
asano
himself,
i
would
think
at
some
point
when
the
ford
company
decides
to
switch
to
electronic
throttles,
of
course
will
have
every
motivation
in
the
world
to
do
precisely
what
your
client
did,
because
he
can't
use
that
thing
that
pulls
back
and
forth
anymore.
rather,
he
has
to
get
a
little
electronic
cap
and
attach
it
to
something
that
moves
in
fixed
proportion
to
the
accelerator
going
up
and
down.
now
those
are
my
whole
reactions
when
i
saw
this
and
i
began
to
think
it
looks
pretty
obvious.
what's
supposed
to
go
on,
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
you
know,
we've
had
a
series
of
cases
and
in
these
series
of
cases
we
have
received
many,
many
briefs
from
all
kinds
of
organizations
and
there
are
many
from
various
parts
of
the
patent
bar
that
defend
very
much
what
the
federal
circuit
does
and
there
are
many
from
parts
of
the
patent
bar
and
others
who
are
saying
basically
that
they've
leaned
too
far
in
the
direction
of
never
seeing
a
patent
they
didn't
like
and
that
has
unfortunate
implications
for
the
economy.
so
if
you're
going
to
these
very
basic
deep
issues,
is
there
a
reason
for
me
to
think,
which
i
do
now
think,
that
there
is
a
huge
argument
going
on
in
those
who
are
interested
in
patent
as
to
whether
there
is
too
much
protectionism
and
not
enough
attention
paid
to
competition
or
whether
it's
about
right,
or
whether
it
goes
some
other
way.
in
other
words,
your
argument
now
suggests
all
this
is
well
settled,
but
i
tend
to
think
maybe
it
isn't
well
settled
and
maybe
it
is
a
proper
thing
for
us
to
be
involved
in.
so
what
are
your
views
since
you
brought
it
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
to
go
on
top.
it's
just
to
say
what
you've
been
saying,
that
what
you're
supposed
to
look
to
ultimately
is
whether
a
person,
as
the
statute
says,
who
is
familiar
with
the
subject,
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art,
whether
to
such
a
person
this
would
have
been
obvious.
now,
there
are
many,
and
this
court
has
listed
several,
factors
that
might
count
in
favor
of
it
not
being
obvious,
such
as
people
have
been
trying
to
do
it
for
a
long
time
and
they
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
how.
that's
a
good
one,
and
there
are
some
other
ones
here.
if
there's
a
teaching
right
there,
it
seems
to
cut
the
other
way.
but
to
hope
to
have
a
nonexclusive
list
seems
to
me
a
little
bit
like
holmes
trying
to
hope
to
have
an
exclusive
list
of
what
counts
as
negligence.
in
the
law
we
have
many
standards
that
you
can
get
clues
about,
but
you
can't
absolutely
define
them,
and
why
isn't
this
one
of
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
supposing
we
then
were
to
say
exactly
what
this
court
already
said,
that
the
standard
here
is
obvious,
we
list
a
few
of
these
additional
factors
that
they've
thrown
in,
and
just
as
the
court
said
before,
all
these
additional
factors
are
there.
they
can
be
considered
in
an
appropriate
case,
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
ultimate
matter
which
is
for
the
judge
is
to
apply
the
word
"obvious"
or
not
in
light
of
the
evidence
and
what
the
experts
say
and
the
facts
as
found
by
a
jury
or
whoever
is
the
factfinder.
would
you
have
any
objection
to
an
opinion
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
basically
an
invention
where
in
fact
there
are
only
four
or
five
moving
parts
on
the
thing
that
we
have
seen,
every
one
of
the
moving
parts
is
moving
with
a
fixed
ratio
to
the
accelerator
going
up
and
down,
as
it
must
be
because
they're
also
moving
in
fixed
ratio
with
the
throttle
thing
coming
out.
and
so,
whichever
of
those
four
that
you
figured
out
you
were
going
to
attach
it
to,
it's
obvious,
isn't
it,
that
you
have
to
attach
it
either
to
the
pedal
or
to
the
throttle
thing
that
comes
out,
or
to
a
part
of
the
machine
that
moves
in
fixed
ratio
to
the
movements
of
one
of
those
two?
now,
that's
what
i
would
find
fairly
obvious.
why
isn't
that
obvious?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
so
quickly
modified
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
doesn't
the
axis
turn?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
there
an
axis,
and
the
axis
turns?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
pivot
rotates?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
i've
worked
out
that
the
raccoons
are
gnawing
the
machine,
at
the
bottom
of
the
garage
door
and
that's
a
problem.
so
i
move
it
to
the
top
of
the
garage
door.
does
that
suddenly...
nobody
before
thought
of
moving
it
to
the
top
of
the
garage
door;
nobody
before
had
thought
of
moving
it
to
a
different
part
that
moves
in
a
constant
ratio
with
the
accelerator.
