but
what
is
the
difference
between
asking
whether
something
is
implicit
in
the,
in
the
prior
art
and
simply
asking
whether
it
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art?
justice

alito,
jr.
well,
once
you
define
the
teaching,
suggestion
and
motivation
test
that
way
so
that
it
can
be
implicit,
it
can
be
based
on
common
sense,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
difference
between
that
and
simply
asking
whether
it's
obvious.
could
you
just
explain
what
that
adds?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
dispute
that
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases,
like
dembiczak
with
the
garbage
bag
that
looks
like
a
pumpkin,
that
this
tsm
test
was
applied
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
ask
for
something
quite
explicit
in
the
prior
art?
