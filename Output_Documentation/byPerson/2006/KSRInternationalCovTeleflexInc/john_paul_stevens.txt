john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
the
asphalt
case,
were
you
suggesting
that
if
they
had
made
a
claim
for
a
process
patent,
that
it
might
have
been
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
there's
a
grammatical
difference
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
obvious
and
the
meaning
of
the
word
apparent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
the
question
is
whether
it's
obvious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me
again,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
it
my...
tell
me
very
briefly,
what
it
is
that
makes
this
invention
nonobvious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
invention,
to
use
an
old-fashioned
term,
is
the
decision
of
where
to
put
the
control.
