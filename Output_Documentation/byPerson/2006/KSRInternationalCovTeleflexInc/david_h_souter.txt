what
do
you
make
of
the,
sort
of
the
revolution
argument
that
whether
it's
contrary
or
intention
with,
in
fact
the,
it's
been
applied
in
what
is
now
the
fed
circuit
for
what,
20
years,
more
than
20
years
i
guess.
and
to
tip
it
over
now
is
going
to
produce
chaos.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
realize
there's
been
comment
on
it,
but
guess
i'm...
i'm
raising
the
question
that
comes
up
in
the
old
motto.
i
mean,
if
the
error
is
common
enough
and
long
enough,
the
error
becomes
the
law.
and
in
effect
is
that
what
we
are
confronted
with
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
if
we
see
it
your
way,
are
there
going
to
be
100,000
cases
filed
tomorrow
morning?
