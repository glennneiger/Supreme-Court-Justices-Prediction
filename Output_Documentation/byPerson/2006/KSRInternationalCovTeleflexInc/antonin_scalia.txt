how
does...
how
does
motivation
enter
into
that
analysis
in
that
case?
how
would
you,
how
would
you
have
applied
the
motivation?
i...
like
justice
breyer,
i
don't
understand
what
the
motivation...
motivation
element
is.
how
would
you
have
applied
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
had
no
particular
motivation
to
use
that
earlier
patent,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
i
have
a
question
that's
sort
of
along
the
lines
of
justice
ginsburg's.
it
isn't
just
the
federal
circuit
that
has
been
applying
this
test.
it's
also
the
patent
office
and
it's
been
following
the
federal
circuit's
test
for
20
years
or
so.
what,
what
is...
assuming
that
we
sweep
that
test
aside
and
say
it's
been
incorrect,
what
happens
to
the
presumption
of
validity
of,
of
patents
which
the
courts
have
been,
have
been
traditionally
applying?
does
it
make
any
sense
to
presume
that
patents
are
valid
which
have
been
issued
under
an
erroneous
test
for
the
last
20
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
right
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
claim
goes
beyond
that.
your
claim
goes
beyond
the
asano
combination
and
in
your
brief
you,
you,
you
discuss
the
case
as
though
your,
your
limited
claim
4
just
relates
to
this
invention
that
you,
you...
nobody
would
have
thought
of
using
the
asano
pedal
in
the
ford
car
given
the
limited
space
available
and
so
forth,
and
therefore,
this
was
really
an
invention.
but
that's
not
the
claim.
the
claim
is
simply
combining
the,
any
pedal,
the
asano
pedal
or
any
other
one
with
the,
with
the
automatic
electronic
sensor.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
asano?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
the
one
that's
standing
up
here
making
that
argument.
they're
not
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
its
test
is
inclusive.
i
would
say
its
test
is
meaningless.
they
have
essentially
said,
our
test
simply
reduces
to
what,
what
your
opponents
in
this
litigation
say.
if
you
think
that's
being
inclusive,
you
know...
it
doesn't
add
anything
whatever
to...
to
the...
to
the
question,
would
a
person
of
the
ordinary
skill
in
this
field
have
conceived
of
this
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is...
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice.
it
is
misleading
to
say
that
the
whole
world
is
embraced
within
these
three
nouns,
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation,
and
then
you
define
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation
to
mean
anything
that
renders
it
nonobvious.
this
is
gobbledygook.
it
really
is,
it's
irrational.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
produces
more
patents,
which
is
what
the
patent
bar
gets
paid
for,
to
acquire
patents,
not
to
get
patent
applications
denied
but
to
get
them
granted.
and
the
more
you
narrow
the
obviousness
standard
to
these
three
imponderable
nouns,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
the
patent
will
be
granted.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
keep
coming
back
to
asano.
why
do
you
keep
coming
back?
your
claim
here
does
not
say
anything
about
asano.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
happened
to
use
asano
simply
because
that's
what
you
stuck
it
on.
but
i
think
their
basis,
their
basic
point,
is
anybody
would
have
thought
to
stick
it
on,
whether
it's
stick
it
on
asano
or
stick
it
onto
some
other
mechanical
accelerator
mechanism.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
the
last
year
or
so,
after
we
granted
cert
in
this
case
after
these
decades
of
thinking
about
it,
it
suddenly
decides
to
polish
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
claim
doesn't
require
that.
