may
i
ask,
if
that's
the
position
of
the
pto,
why
aren't
they
proceeding
to
cancel
the
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is,
you
say
the
pto
has
recognized
that
it
issued
this
patent,
that
it's
an
invalid
issuance.
so
why
aren't
they
curing
their
own
mistakes,
never
mind
what
a
court
is
going
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
talking
about
what
the
law
should
be.
would
you
make,
be
making
the
same
argument
if
we
were
looking
at
the
most
recent
decisions
of
the
federal
circuit,
the
ones
that
they
issued
within
the
year,
and
each
as
i
remember
they
held
that
the
patent
was
obvious
and
therefore
invalid?
suppose
we
were
dealing
in
what
was,
the
cases
were,
what
were
they,
kahn,
alpha,
and
diestar?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
disagree
with
the
motivation
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
perhaps
you're
not
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
this
is
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
test.
i
think
i
understand
you
right,
now,
just
to
say
teaching
suggestion
motivation
has
its
place;
it's
okay;
but
it--
shouldn't
be
the
exclusive
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
i
understand
your
brief
to
say
is
that
it
has
to
be
supplemented
with
what
you
have
called,
you've
labelled
"sufficiently
innovative".
and
then
i
begin
to
think
well,
what's
"sufficiently
innovative"?
how
is
a
trier
supposed
to
know
if
something...
in
other
words
i
think
what
you're
suggesting
as
a
supplement
is
rather
vague.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
experts?
you
said
this
was
obvious
and
this
should
have,
not
have
gotten
very
far.
but
there
were
two
experts,
were
there
not,
who
made
declarations,
that
had
all
kinds
of
credentials,
and
they
called
it
elegant,
novel
and
nonobvious.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
these,
these
were
declarants
who
gave
a
whole
declaration.
they
didn't
just
say
that
bottom
line.
