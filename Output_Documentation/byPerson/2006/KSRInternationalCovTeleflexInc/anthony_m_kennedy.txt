justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
be,
would
it
be
inadvisable
for
us
to
say
the
motive
test
teaches
us
something
important;
it
has
a
valuable
place;
it's
just
not
the
exclusive
test
for
what's
obvious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
do
we
have
to
reject
it
all
out
of...
out
of
hand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
motivation
in
this
special
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but,
but
my
question
is
does
it
not
serve
to
show
us
at
least
one
way
in
which
there
can
be
obviousness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
may
not
be
the
exclusive
test.
we're...
i'm
asking
what
the
test
ought
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it
took
from
10
years
to
go
from...
i
think
10
years
from
asano
to
engelgau,
so
it
must
have
been
not
all
that
obvious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you,
do
you
concede...
do
you
concede
that
claims
1
through
3
are
valid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
had
asked
your
opinion
as
an
expert
would
you...--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
argument
that
you're
making
as
to
ford
is
that
anybody
knows
you
could,
you
use
an
electronic...
you
have
an
electronic
throttle,
it
serves
a
purpose;
the
pedal
serves
a
purpose;
put
the
two
together.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
doesn't...
don't
1,
2
and
3
do
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they're
invalid
then
i
have...
then
i'm
struggling
to
find
what
your
test
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
what
your
test
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
in
that
context
it
would
serve
a
valid
purpose,
i.e.,
can
we...
that
is
to
say,
can
we
keep
the
motivation
test
and
then
supplement
it
with
other,
with
other
means
of,
other
ways
of
showing
obviousness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
would
there
have
been
anything
for
a
jury
under
your
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
claims
1,
2
and
3?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
looks
like
dystar
was
decided
by
the
federal
circuit
after
it
decided
this
case,
didn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you
have
to
be
defending
what
the
federal
circuit
did
in
this
case.
and
the
fact
that
they
say
well
now,
what
this
means
is
really
in
some
other
case,
that
seems
to
me
that's
really
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
you
should
tell
us
when
the
case
has
been
decided
after,
i
think
it
has
much
less,
much
less
weight.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
your...
the
federal
circuit
is
saying
that
it
is
obvious
if
and
only
if
the
previous
patents
taught
this.
but
you,
you
can
look
at
these
two
devices,
and
you're
a
good
mechanic,
you've
never
seen
a
patent,
you've
never
read
these
patents,
you've
never
read
these
claims,
you've
never
been
to
the
supreme
court,
and
you
put
them
together.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
federal
circuit
said
oh,
it's
not
in
the
patent,
it's
not
obvious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
in
this
case
let's
assume
that
we
all
strike
out
on
coming
out
with
the
magic
formulation.
one
of
the
ways
the
law
progresses
is
we
go
from
case
to
case,
and
in
this
case
you
have
two
standards
of
operation.
one
is
a
pedal
that
basically
operates
by
pressure.
the
other...
and
by
levers.
other
is
by
electronics,
and
these
are
two
different
methods
of
making
the
carburetor
release
the
fuel.
so
why
not,
so
somebody
combines
them.
why
is
that
such
a
big
deal
as,
as
claim
4
says
it
is.
certainly
this
inventor
would
not
be
the
only
one
to
think
that
the
two
could
and
should
be
combined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
in
this
case
where
the
wires
were
getting
frayed
until
this
disclosure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose
i
read
the
record
the
other
way.
suppose
i
read
the
record
as
saying
this
invention
stopped
the
wires
from
being
frayed
and
therefore
it
was
an
advance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
too
is
a
patent
case.
the
legal
question
involves
one
of
the
test
or
legal
formulations
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
to
determine
a
patent
that
is
obvious
and
that’s
invalid
and
before
addressing
that
we
have
to
understand
the
patent
and
the
alleged
invention
at
issue
if
they
has
to
do
with
accelerator
pedals
and
accelerator
systems
for
trucks
and
automobiles.
in
some
vehicles
the
manufacturer
can
decide
to
design
it
so
that
the
whole
pedal
system
can
be
adjusted
in
order
to
move
it
closer
or
further
away
from
the
driver,
if
for
example
the
driver
of
short
stature
is
in
the
truck
with
a
deep
footwell
and
the
seat
doesn’t
quite
adjust
the
right
way
the
whole
pedal
system
can
be
moved
forward
for
greater
ease
of
operation,
and
there
were
known
an
patent
and
systems
for
adjustable
pedal
assemblies.
then
a
new
development
came
along,
computer
controlled
engines.
for
more
than
a
decade
now,
many
automobiles
and
truck
engines
have
used
computers
to
control
the
engine,
and
to
control
engine
throttle
particularly.
this
meant
that
the
accelerator
pedal
had
to
be
redesigned,
before
computers
the
pedal
would
connect
to
the
throttle
via
a
mechanical
link
usually
a
cable
pushing
down
the
accelerator,
pull
the
cable
and
open
valves
in
the
throttle
to
increase
the
flow
of
fuel
and
air
in
order
to
increase
combustion
and
accelerate
the
vehicle
and
as
you
release
the
pedal
the
opposite
occur.
the
benefit
of
having
a
computer
control
of
a
throttle
is
so
the
engine
can
respond
to
various
other
factors
besides
the
pedals
positions
and
that’s
increased
fuel
efficiency
and
engine
performance.
the
problem
was
how
is
the
computer
to
know
the
position
of
the
pedal.
the
answer
was
to
use
a
censor
hat
could
detect
the
pedals
position
and
transmit
that
position
to
the
computer
but
then
the
question
became
where
and
how
should
the
censor
be
located,
where
do
you
put
it
and
in
adjustable
pedal
assembly
the
censor
placement
had
to
take
account
of
the
movable
mechanism.
the
challenges
pedal
designer
face
and
overcame
in
attempting
to
attach
censors
to
the
pedal
are
described
in
the
opinion.
now
that
brings
us
to
the
parties
in
the
case.
ksr
is
the
petitioner
here
it
is
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
pedals
including
adjustable
pedals.
to
satisfy
a
customers
demand
of
an
adjustable
pedal
with
a
censor
ksr
solved
the
problem
by
taking
one
of
it's
previously
designed
adjustable
pedal
systems
and
sticking
them
off
the
shelve
or
on
the
market
censor
to
as
fixed
pivot
point
that
is
the
point
around
which
the
arm
of
the
pedal
rotates.
as
soon
as
it
revealed
his
plan
to
provide
this
pedal
to
its
customers
the
ksr
received
a
notice
from
teleflex,
and
teleflex
is
the
respondent
here.
teleflex
said
that
putting
a
censor
on
a
fixed
pivot
point
of
an
adjustable
pedal,
infringed
claim
for
of
a
patent
that
was
licensed
to
teleflex
and
that
patent
is
called
the
engelgau
patent.
ksr
refused
to
negotiate
a
subset
of
sublicense.
teleflex
sued
for
infringement,
ksr
defended.
ksr
argued
the
claim
for
engelgau,
though
approved
by
the
patent
and
trademark
office
was
nonetheless
invalid
because
it
was
obvious.
section
103
of
the
patent
act
provides
that
no
patent
shall
issue
for
an
obvious
claim.
adjustable
pedal
with
fixed
pivot
points
ksr
said
were
known
before
engelgau
patent
was
invented,
so
it
was
obvious
to
put
a
censor
on
them.
the
district
courts
agreed
with
ksr
and
granted
some
re-judgment
against
teleflex.
teleflex
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
claim
for
of
the
engelgau
patent
was
not
obvious
on
it's
faced
and
that
there
should
be
trial
on
the
issue.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
in
agreement
with
the
district
court
we
find
that
claim
for
describe
what
was
an
obvious
solution
to
a
known
problem
and
so
the
claim
is
invalid.
when
the
issue
is
whether
a
patent
claim
is
obvious
the
enquiry
is
not
about
the
subjective
intent
for
the
stated
purpose
of
the
inventor.
the
question
is
the
test
is
an
objective
one.
it
is
whether
the
patents
claims
subject
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
and
the
relevant
art.
at
the
time
of
the
invention
our
precedence
teach
that
the
combination
of
familiar
elements
according
to
known
methods
is
likely
to
be
obvious,
when
it
does
no
more
than
yield
predictable
results
and
this
court
is
held
in
a
leading
case
called
graham
v.
john
deere
and
actually
in
cases
decided
before
and
after
graham.
but
this
enquiry
is
a
broad
one
and
these
cases
represent
the
proper
way
to
interpret
and
apply
103
and
the
main
question
we
must
resolve
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
followed
these
principals
when
it
rejected
the
argument
that
the
patent
claim
was
obvious
and
when
it
relied
on
its
own
so
called
tsm
test,
tsm
stands
for
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation.
the
tsm
test
captures
a
helpful
insight
that
patent
composed
of
several
elements
is
not
proved
obvious
merely
by
demonstrating
that
each
of
its
elements
was
independently
known
in
the
prior
art,
and
in
the
years
since
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
set
forth
the
essence
of
the
tsm
test
the
court
of
appeals
no
doubt
has
applied
the
test
in
accord
with
our
precedence
and
in
accord
with
section
103
in
many
cases,
but
in
the
case
before
us
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
test
in
a
rigid
mandatory
way,
with
a
rigid
mandatory
formula
and
that
constrained
the
obviousness
enquiry.
person
of
ordinary
skill
and
pedal
design
would
see
the
obvious
benefits
in
adding
censors
to
adjustable
pedals.
at
the
time
of
the
invention
in
this
case
there
was
an
adjustable
pedal
with
a
fixed
pivot
point
and
censors
that
could
be
mounted
on
it.
so
the
combination
of
the
two
was
oblivious
claim
for
the
engelgau
patent
is
thus
invalid.
teleflex
cannot
claim
an
exclusive
right
to
what
would
have
been
obvious
to
any
pedal
designer
of
ordinary
skill.
where
as
here
the
content
of
the
prior
art,
the
scope
of
the
patent
claim
and
the
level
of
the
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
are
not
a
material
dispute
and
the
obviousness
of
the
claim
is
apparent
is
light
of
these
factors,
summary
judgment
is
appropriate.
ksr
was
correct
that
the
engelgau
patent
sought
to
claim
an
obvious
combination
of
known
elements
of
prior
art.
if
patent
was
to
promote
rather
than
staple
progress
of
the
useful
arts
than
patents
like
the
one
in
question
but
not
to
be
issued
and
or
invalid
despite
the
presumption
in
their
favor
for
these
reasons
to
explain
in
more
detail
in
the
opinion
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
