we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
04-1350,
ksr
international
versus
teleflex,
incorporated.
mr.
dabney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
reason
that
the
federal
circuit
has
devised
this
additional
test
or
gloss
on
graham
is
that
they
say
obviousness
is,
it's
deceptive
in
hindsight.
in
hindsight
everybody
says,
i
could
have
thought
of
that;
and
that
you
need...
if
you
don't
have
the
sort
of
constraint
that
their
test
imposes,
it's
going
to
be
too
easy
to
say
that
everything
was
obvious.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
a
motive
to
answer
that
question
right
away.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dabney.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
understand
motivation
to
refer
to
in
that
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
when
you
talk
about
the
statutory
focus,
your
innovation
test...
i
mean,
do
you
regard
that,
is
that
a
legal
conclusion
of
nonobviousness?
or
is
it
an
additional
test
beyond
what
the
statute
requires?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
adds
a
layer
of
federal
circuit
jargon
that
lawyers
can
then
bandy
back
and
forth,
but
if
it's...
particularly
if
it's
nonexclusive,
you
can
say
you
can
meet
our
teaching,
suggestion,
or
motivation
test
or
you
can
show
that
it's
nonobvious,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
worse
than
meaningless
because
it
complicates
the
inquiry
rather
than
focusing
on
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which
way
does
that
cut?
that
just
indicates
that
this
is
profitable
for
the
patent
bar.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
in
claim
4
do
you
say
it's
putting
it
together
in
a
particular
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
do
you
get
to
be
an
expert
to
tell
you
something's
not
obvious.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
the
least
insightful
person
you
can
find?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
the
federal
circuit's
approach
focuses
narrowly
prior
to
our
grant
of
certiorari,
allegedly
more
flexibly
after,
on
prior
art,
as
opposed.
to
i
would
say
common
sense.
and
so
they
say
we
have
to
find
something
in
prior
art
to
show
that
this
was
non...
that
this
was
obvious.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
just...
what
makes
it
nonobvious
is
that
it's
attached
to
a
nonmoving
piece?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
just
to
follow
up
from
justice
stevens'
question,
what
makes
this
nonobvious
is
the
decision
to
place
the
electronic
control
on
a
part
of
the
car
that
doesn't
move?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
wires
would
get
worn,
worn
down,
right?
and
the
invention
here
is
well,
let's
not
put
it
somewhere
where
it
doesn't
move,
and
so
the
wires
won't
move
and
it
won't
get
worn
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
dabney,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining
but
you
may
take
four.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
04-1350
ksr
international
co.
v.
teleflex.
