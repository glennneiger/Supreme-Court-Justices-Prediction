justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
question
whether
it
comes
from
one
tariff
rather
than
another
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
were
--
was
that
for
initial
determination
by
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
wondering
what
they're
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
position
that
--
that
the
i.c.c.
should
determine
this
question
initially?
justice
felix
frankfurter
never
been
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
an
issue
and
initial
question
under
what
tariff
it
comes.
after
you
decided
that,
namely
the
tax,
(inaudible)
particular
tariff
under
which
purportedly
some
is
unreasonable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
it
is
common
ground
that
in
this
case
the
determination
of
which
tariff
is
applicable
was
the
matter
for
the
court
without
the
intervention,
the
prior
intervention
of
the
i.c.c.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
decide
up
by
looking
at
the
tariffs
and
--
and
considering
what
this
stuff
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
telling
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
saying
is,
this
is
a
great
northern
case,
not
an
abilene
oil
case,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
more
--
the
more
you
invoke
the
purpose
of
a
tariff,
the
more
you
invoke
consideration,
the
relevance
of
consideration
beneath
the
surface
of
the
actual
tariff
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
more
--
the
more
you
will
find
there
being,
you
push
the
problems
into
the
competence
of
the
commission
not
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
this
had
been
a
private
shipper,
mr.
hollander
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
your
--
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
your
view
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
because
the
government
can
go
--
is
this
because
they
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
--
but
the
difference
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
simply
because
--
because
the
carrier
can
go
against
the
government
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
can't
go
--
those
carriers
in
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
know
the
result
but
i
want
to
know
the
position
of
the
shipper,
is
it
any
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
by
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
by
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
you
are
challenging
what
i
gather
from
looking
at
your
brief
i've
got
only
this
morning,
has
been
the
position
of
the
court
of
claims
since
1926,
that
the
six-year
general
statute
applies
in
favor
of
a
suit
by
a
carrier
against
the
government
as
against
the
specific
two-year.
do
you
challenge
that
--
that
series
that
settled
doctrine
of
the
court
of
claims
since
1926?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
challenge
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
that.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
if
they
govern
by
a
rule
which
has
prevailed
in
the
court
of
claims
since
1926.
i
can
understand,
you
are
saying
you
think
it's
so
wrong.
we
should
throw
it
out
of
the
window.
but
if
you
don't
--
if
you
don't
question
it
then
you
don't
challenge
it
for
my
purpose,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
to
make
any
brief
statement
categorically
what
the
government
position
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
can't
then
you
want
the
court
sua
sponte
to
look
into
that
interceding
problem,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
on
what
basis
may
the
comptroller
general
not
honor
the
bill
that's
presented
by
the
carrier
since
he
got
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
as
here?
what
did
they
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
rate
--
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
that
the
government
spoke
of,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
still
haven't
got
it
included
in
my
opinion.
i
understood
from
you
that
the
comptroller
general
in
fact
deducted
the
freight
bill
presented
by
the
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
is
to
--
to
what
will
be
deducted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
what
subject
matter
--
on
--
and
on
what
basis
did
he
say,
doesn't
fall
under
the
incendiary
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
different
one
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
one
that
we
encountered
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
your
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
you
do
not
know
the
time
period
that
that
is
irrelevant
in
that
the
settlement
by
the
comptroller
general,
unilateral
action
by
him
as
it
were
quite
clean
up
the
whole
slate,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
does
the
government
know
that
the
rate
which
they
are
now
claiming
and
this
suit
claim
was
unreasonable?
when
did
they
know
that
the
carrier
was
insisting
on
that
unreasonable
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and?
justice
felix
frankfurter
+before
you
--
before
you
do
that.
on
page
6
of
the
record,
paragraph
three,
i
should
think
unless
i
misread
what
the
commissioner
certified
as
having
been
at
least
as
in
the
(inaudible)
the
difference
between
the
charge
claimed
by
the
plaintiff
and
the
charges
made
by
the
defendant
as
reported
by
the
general
accounting
office
and
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
in
the
union
pacific
case
is
in
dollars
paid
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
follows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
to
mean
anything
except
that
the
union
pacific
case
is
controlling
in
determining
the
recovery
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
isn't
open
to
the
government
to
challenge
the
union
pacific
case
in
this
--
in
this
argument.
i
do
mean
to
suggest
and
adhere
to
the
suggestion
of
their
veteran
bodies
that
that
sentence
means
nothing
unless
it
means
that
on
the
basis
of
the
classification
to
union
pacific.
in
fact,
if
the
circumstances
being
to
say
it
amounts
to
$14,000
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
else
unless
it
means
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
by
venue
that
i.c.c.
is
much
more
competent
in
raising
validity
of
those
three
arguments
than
i
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
getting
enlightenment
on
the
--
on
the
classification
from
the
commission
in
order
to
exercise
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
your
mind,
loose
or
in
packages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
here
knows
that
the
railroad
should
claim
these
bombs
that
come
under
--
what
is
it
1840?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
--
i'm
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
know
that
tariff
1820,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
that
filed
originally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
know
if
the
government
have
means
of
contesting
a
known
claim
by
the
railroad
that
that
tariff
covers
these
kind
of
bombs
in
ample
time
to
protect
itself
against
claims
by
the
commission,
a
collection
by
the
commission
which
would
be
barred
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
of
what
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
the
government
then
and
there,
from
your
point
of
view
to
the
broader
proceeding
before
the
commission,
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
that
rate
and
seeking
to
have
it
declared
unreasonableness
--
unreasonable
insofar
as
apply
to
this
kind
of
commodity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
four
or
five
union
pacific
case,
which
is
the
one
that
you
referred
in
the
so-called
stipulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
paid
promptly
in
the
aroostook
and
the
seaboard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
to
say
in
1944
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
shipment
was
in
1944
when
the
payments
were
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
would
admit,
don't
you
that
the
i.c.c.
is
a
more
informed
body
to
determine
what
classification
tariff,
what
classification
apply
to
the
general
accounting
office.
the
government
thinks
that
--
that
a
bill
that
is
presented
and
under
these
classification
with
all
--
with
all
great
respect
to
that
on
(inaudible)
offer,
general
accounting
office
are
usually
the
i.c.c.
the
better
place
to
fight
this
out
than
general
accounting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
question
what
congress
has
ordered
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
under
six
--
not
if
the
--
not
if
the
six-year
rule
prevail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
blow
hot
and
cold
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
the
courts
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
know
that
until
the
court
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
could
you
not
have
gone
to
the
commission
to
just
prove
the
reasonableness
of
this
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
true
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
true
of
bangor
and
aroostook
i
gather?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
this
deduction
was
made
the
same
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
if
you
had
--
if
the
government
has
gone,
i
take
it
you're
in
an
(inaudible),
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
what
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
just
--
just
the
same
question
now,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
in
this
case,
would
you
have
been
thrown
out
if
you've
brought
up
an
action
for
the
i.c.c.
saying
the
government
has
billed
us
at
a
rate
on
a
wrong
class
on
--
they
claim
this
is
the
classification
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
classification.
would
you
have
been
thrown
out
by
the
i.c.c.on
1945
or
1944?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
bill
presented
on
the
--
under
the
--
first
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
classification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know
what
the
carriers'
position
was
and
the
carrier
isn't
going
to
render
you
a
bill
and
the
next
they
change
his
mind,
is
it?
what
i
want
to
know
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
i.c.c.
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit,
a
proceeding
by
--
by
the
shipper
with
the
united
states
or
any
other
shipper
saying,
this
tariff
is
unreasonable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
you
think
if
i
have
been
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
i
could
have
said
to
you
no
mater
what
the
general
accounting
office
judge,
they
can't
determine
the
relevant
and
reasonable
tariff.
that's
the
business
with
the
permission
with
oversight
by
the
court.
you
don't
think
i
could
have
said
that
instead
of
course
that
i
won't
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
