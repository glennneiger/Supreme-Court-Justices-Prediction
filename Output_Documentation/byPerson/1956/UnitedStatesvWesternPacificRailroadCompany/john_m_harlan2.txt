justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
really
--
doesn't
that
really
involved
the
same
question
as
to
whether
the
--
these
un-fused
bombs
come
under
the
tariff,
under
a
particular
tariff?
what's
the
difference
between
"s"
and
"s's"
between
those
two
questions?
if
reasonableness
is
a
matter
for
the
commission,
why
is
it
the
question
of
the
tariff
--
proper
tariff
application
also
a
matter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
really
a
question
of
extrinsic
aid,
it's
a
question
of
informed
knowledge.
questions
like
that
are
to
be
determined
by
the
i.c.c.
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is,
not
because
they
had
extrinsic
aid
that
the
court
doesn't.
i
think
that's
something
that
the
average
court
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
--
why
is
that
--
why
is
that?
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
difference
between
the
position
of
the
private
shipper
when
sued
by
a
carrier
and
the
united
states
government?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
say
there
is
a
complete
difference
that
the
private
shipper
wouldn't
be
faced
with
this
situation,
why
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
--
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
is
the
question
of
whether
the
six-year
statute,
tucker
act
limitation
or
the
state
commerce
two-year
limitation
whether
the
--
whether
which
one
governs
the
--
whether
the
court
--
whether
the
tucker
act
properly
governs
this
case,
this
suit
by
the
railroad
carriers,
is
that
before
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we've
got
to
--
we've
got
to
assume
for
this
purpose
at
least
unless
we
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
put
--
to
put
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
put
the
matter
another
way,
you
think
you
can
achieve
your
position
up
here
without
challenging
the
applicability
of
the
six-year
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
hollander
are
you
going
to
say
anything
more
about
the
morrisdale
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
of
that
and
maybe
there's
one
little
at
that
point.
