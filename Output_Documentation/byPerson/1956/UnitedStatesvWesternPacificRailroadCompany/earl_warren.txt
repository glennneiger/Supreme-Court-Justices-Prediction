how
long
--
how
long
after
the
--
the
deduction
was
made
by
the
comptroller
general?
was
it
before
the
action
was
brought
by
the
carriers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
that
over
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
stipulation
colonel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
--
what
did
you
say
the
effect
of
the
stipulation
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
this,
all
the
stipulation
does
is
to
say
that
the
articles
transported
in
these
cases,
in
these
instances
are
like
the
articles
transported
in
union
pacific
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
case
number
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
49505.
now,
does
the
government
claim
at
this
time
that
the
articles
in
this
case
were
transported
are
different
from
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
colonel,
that
--
that
doesn't
quite
meet
the
point
i
--
i
make.
they
say
the
cases
are
different
but
are
they
--
are
they
saying
any
place
in
their
brief
or
did
he
say
--
did
mr.
hollander
say
on
his
argument
here
that
the
articles
transported
in
these
instances
were
unlike
those
transported
in
the
union
pacific
case?i
didn't
so
understand
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
in
his
brief
does
he
say
that?
that's
what
i'd
like
to
see
because
that's
rather
substantial
thing
in
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
colonel,
isn't
that
entirely
different
from
saying
that
the
--
that
the
items
transported
were
similar
to
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
two
cases?
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
only
the
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
--
did
it
--
did
the
government
either
in
its
brief
or
in
its
argument
here
contend
that
the
articles
were
not
the
same
in
fact
as
to
union
pacific.
if
they
did,
i'd
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
see
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
that's
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
their
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
read
the
language
that
you
think
encompasses
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
these
--
suppose
these
casings
were
not
filled
with
that
jelly,
would
you
still
be
entitled
the
rate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
this
jelly
is
more
volatile
and
more
dangerous
than
gasoline
which
is
its
principal
component
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
they
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
fuses,
they
had
fuses
and
explosive
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
characteristics
and
didn't
even
--
were
not
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hollander,
i
asked
colonel
wiener,
what
was
the
date
of
the
deduction
made
by
the
government
and
how
long
thereafter
was
it
before
the
railroad
company
filed
its
lawsuit?
do
you
know
those
dates?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hollander,
are
these
deductions
made
by
the
government
under
this
permissive
act
isolated
instances
or
does
it
happen
as
a
matter
of
daily
routine,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
not
heard
that
yet.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
still
in
this,
i've
got
a
question
i'd
like
to
ask
in
this
case
for
within
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
hollander,
two
of
these
cases,
the
railroad
charged
the
low-rate
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
higher
rate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
then
that's
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
may
i
ask
you
this?
bearing
upon
the
question
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
government
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
ask
advice
on
each
one
of
these
deductions,
do
you
think
you
could
get
for
us
a
number
of
deductions
that
were
made
say
since
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
present
time
since
these
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
since
these
shipments
were
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
so
we
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
if
you
will
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
if
it
--
has
your
question
been
answered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
we
better
get
on
to
the
next
case
now.
it's
in
your
brief
i
take
mr.
hollander?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
