justice

would
you
mind
pointing
out
the
language
on
which
the
court
of
claims
says
--
the
court
of
claims
says,
“bars
the
government.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
it
doesn't
disturb
you
too
much.
what
is
reading
the
language
on
which
the
court
of
claims
rests
its
conclusion
that
there
can
be
six
years,
a
suit
filed
against
the
government
within
six
years
or
a
suit
against
the
carrier
or
a
private
person
to
be
filed
in
two
years?
what
--
what
is
the
language
on
which
they
rely?
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
statute
before
the
end
on
page
3
of
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
does
it
say
anything
about
six
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
you're
saying
that
this
should
be
governed
by
this
particular
section
but
you
put
--
printed
on
page
3
and
not
by
those
other
six
years
actually,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
suit
was
filed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
the
government
--
in
1934
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
did
the
claim
arise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
railroad
sued
the
government?
justice
hugo

black
claiming
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
claiming
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
underpaid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
government
pleaded
that
we
have
not
underpaid
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
of
claims
has
held
that
you
cannot
plead
there
as
an
offset
or
a
recoupment
or
a
defense
of
any
kind
at
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
didn't
sue
you
until
after
--
until
the
--
about
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
understand
how
can
read
that
conclusion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
the
union
pacific
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
controlling
investment.
just
from
that
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
says
that
the
difference
is
so
many
dollars
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
way
they
figured
the
difference
in
the
union
pacific
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
that
you
could
be
governed
in
everything
about
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
colonel
wiener
where
is
the
--
that
precise
language
for
this
rate
in
the
record?
does
it
say
incendiary
bombs
or
what
did
it
say?i
--
i
haven't
seen
that
in
either
records.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
language
is
what
i
wanted
to
be
--
of
the
tariff's.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
which
one
is
it,
do
you
think
governs
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
number
which
--
what
number
which
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1820.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
your
contention
is
that
these
were
explosive
incendiary.
they're
incendiary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i
asked
was
in
connectin
with
judge
madden's
dissent
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
misunderstand
him?
i
thought
he
said
that
you
people
agreed
it
was
not
incendiary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
except
they've
given
the
name
incendiary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
not
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
in
the
field
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
add
--
add
something
to
it
to
get
ignited.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
saying
that
the
meaning
given
here
is
that
even
though
it
is
not
incendiary
in
the
sense
that
it
will
explode
but
nevertheless
is
to
be
considered
as
such
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
the
--
under
the
ruling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
this
--
is
this
anymore
explosive
than
--
i
think
someone
asked
you
that
question,
i'm
not
sure,
they're
just
plain
gasoline?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
more
explosive
and
more
incendiary,
more
easier
to
explode?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what's
--
what's
the
rate
on
gasoline?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
--
that's
the
difference.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
what
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
real
difference
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
that
even
though
this
might
not
be
within
the
classification
of
being
more
incendiary
explosives
and
gasoline
nevertheless,
under
the
practice
and
the
classification
is
to
be
treated
as
an
incendiary
bomb
within
the
meaning
of
1800.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
discussed
one
thing
and
i
--
i
don't
like
to
interrupt
you
but
i
am
interested
in
it
and
i
--
i
don't
understand
it
fully
yet,
i
don't
understand
the
answer.
if
the
government
is
given
six
years
in
which
to
file
this
suit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
carrier
and
the
government
can
be
sued
at
anytime
within
six
years,
actually
action
motive,
why
--
on
what
basis
should
the
government
be
denied
the
right
to
offset
or
to
set
up
as
a
defense
or
to
recoup
or
whatever
it
is,
if
--
if
a
suit
is
actually
brought
against
it
even
though
the
two
years
for
bringing
an
affirmative
action
has
expired?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
has
there
been
any
case
yet
that
passed
on
this
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
held
that
you
cannot
set
it
up
as
a
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it
arises
out
of
the
same
transaction
and
it's
purely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
morrisdale.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
morrisdale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask
you
this
in
that
connection
because
this
gets
to
a
little
more
than
just
i
think,
of
claims
decision
on
cases
heretofore.
the
government
did
know,
we'll
say
that
there
had
been
cases
it
held
that
it
had
to
sue
within
two
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
the
government
knew
that
it
--
the
government
that
the
railroad
had
not
filed
any
suit,
had
it
notified
the
government
that
it
was
going
to
try
to
collect
the
--
i
--
i
presume
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
doesn't
file
suits
because
it
would
take
it
as
--
acquiesced
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that
raises
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
litigants
put
it
up
in
different
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
different
charges.
