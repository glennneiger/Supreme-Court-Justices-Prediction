mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
court
please.
in
this
case
as
in
the
(inaudible)
case
argued
last
week,
the
government
comes
before
this
court
asserting
that
it
is
not
like
other
shippers.
that
it
is
not
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
it
is
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
this
court
which
forbids
the
smuggling
of
additional
questions
into
the
case
after
certiorari
is
granted,
that
it
can
shift
its
position
on
the
classification
issue
and
that
it
can
welsh
on
the
stipulation
solemnly
entered
into
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
i
shall
deal
first
with
the
question
of
procedure,
the
administrative
law
question
arising
out
of
the
request
for
a
reference
and
then
with
the
question
of
classification.
now,
there
is
one
difference
between
the
government's
position
in
the
(inaudible)
and
here.
in
the
north
appears
it
only
sought
one
advantage
over
other
shippers.
here
it
has
several
advantages
over
ordinary
shippers
now
and
at
once
another.
where
a
shipper,
the
ordinary
shipper
brings
suit
in
court
for
overcharges
seeking
to
recover
overcharges
it's
bound
by
limitations.
but
this
court
has
held
and
the
lower
courts
following
it
have
held
that
where
the
government
sues
for
overcharges
it
is
not
barred
by
limitations
because
it
is
the
sovereign.
and
similarly,
it
has
been
held
in
the
court
of
claims
that
where
the
government
counterclaims
are
on
alleged
overcharges
that
accrued
before
the
period
of
limitations,
it
isn't
bound
by
limitations.
and
the
government
has
an
additional
advantage
and
that
is
the
comptroller
general's
unilateral
power
of
settle
where
as
in
the
bangor
and
aroostook
and
seaboard
cases
in
this
number
18,
the
government
has
paid
the
carriers
at
the
billed
rates.
the
comptroller
general
has
the
power
to
say,
“that
was
a
wrong
payment.
i
will
deduct
from
your
subsequent
bills
the
additional
amount
that
i
think
you
were
overpaid.”
and
that
was
done
here
and
that
is
a
power
that
can
be
exercised
without
any
limitation
as
to
time.
now,
here
as
in
so
many
other
cases
when
that
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
comptroller
general's
power
has
been
judicially
condemned
now,
the
government
wants
to
go
to
the
commission.
before
then
it
was
perfectly
--
it
is
satisfied
to
invoke
the
administrative
meet
acts
of
the
general
accounting
office.
now,
it
wants
to
resort
to
the
expertise
in
the
scope
of
the
commission.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
will
simply
say
and
apply
as
here
an
erroneous
rule
of
transportation
law
and
say,
“this
wasn't
the
proper
rate.
these
are
different
articles.
you
can't
get
this
much.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
this
rate,
in
this
case,
the
articles
were
billed
as
incendiary
bombs.
i
will
show
that
under
accepted
theories
of
rate
classification
that
was
the
correct
classification.
the
comptroller
general
said,
they
should
have
been
billed
as
combination
articles
under
the
combination
rule
and
simply
deducted.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
the
government's
position
here
--
i
mean
they
started
out
by
saying
that
this
isn't
an
incendiary
bomb.
and
then
they
wanted
a
reference
and
with
the
petition
for
certiorari
they
said
it
is
not
an
incendiary
bomb
because
it
is
not
covered
by
the
explosives
regulations.
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
they
said;
“well,
anyway
we
should
have
--
should
have
been
awarded
summary
judgment
against
it.”
now,
in
their
reply
brief
and
in
their
oral
argument
they
reverted
to
the
comptroller
general's
notion
that
the
combination
rule
applies
and
of
course
as
i
will
point
out
later,
it
doesn't.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
did,
yes.
first,
they
were
paid
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
subsequent
bills
for
the
same
carriers.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
said
--
he
--
he
did
it
on
the
basis
of
the
combination
rule.
rule,
i
think
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
rule
17.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
the
--
the
government
now,
have
to
--
on
its
third
position
has
got
around
to
saying
that
the
arguing
that
the
combination
rule
was
proper
because
all
the
ingredients
for
fifth
class,
therefore,
the
entire
entity
was
fifth-class
which
of
course
hasn't
been
the
law.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
within
the
six
years.
i
don't
know
exactly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
within
the
six-year
period.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
may
have
been.
but
at
any
rate
the
--
the
deduction,
the
instant
--
the
deduction,
i
think,
was
more
than
two
years
after
the
shipments
had
--
had
been
made.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
the
exact
date
of
the
deductions.
all
the
record
shows
is
that
the
deductions
were
made
less
than
six
years
before
the
time
this
suit
was
brought.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
i
mean
it's
--
it's
without
limitations
as
this
court
has
held.
the
comptroller
general
can
come
along
five,
six,
10
years
later
and
say;
“you
were
overpaid
and
we
will
set
off
this
overpayment
against
your
current
bill.”
and
that's
the
way
the
comptroller
operates.
now,
if
another
shipment
wants
to
attack
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate,
and
that
goes
to
all
questions
of
hazard,
any
question
of
reasons,
he
must
apply
to
the
commission
within
two
years.
now,
the
government
wants
forever
to
apply.
they
had
a
remedy
which
they
didn't
invoke
so
we
come
to
the
central
issue
in
this
case
which
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
limitation
provision
on
the
limitation
for
applying
to
the
commission
for
a
determination
as
to
the
alleged
unreasonableness
of
a
rate.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
would
say
when
the
bill
was
presented.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
which
was
well
within
two
years
of
the
time
that
the
shipment
was
made
i
--
i
assume
that
because
railroads
don't
ordinarily
wait
two
years
to
bill
shippers
so
they
knew
it
then
and
they
could
have
--
they
could
--
so
the
--
the
heart
of
the
case
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
limitations
provision
on
applying
to
the
commission
for
determination
of
reasonableness
vel
non.
what
mr.
hollander
says
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
on
it.
but
there's
a
great
deal
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
rulings
of
the
commission
and
they
are
uniformly
to
the
effect
that
the
expiration
of
the
statutory
period
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
commission
that
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis's
jurisdiction.
in
other
words
this
is
the
limitation
going
not
to
the
standing
of
the
litigant
but
a
limitation
going
to
the
power
of
the
tribunal.
and
therefore,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
held
for
years
that
when
the
united
states
seeks
repatriation
on
the
basis
of
an
alleged
unreasonableness
of
the
rate,
if
they
come
in
more
than
two
years,
later
they
can't
succeed
and
they
can't
maintain
the
action.
and
the
same
rule
has
been
applied
to
the
ordinary
shipper
in
this
court
in
the
morrisdale
case.
that
was
a
case
back
in
the
230th
u.s.
when
the
concept
of
the
exclusive
commission
jurisdiction
over
questions
of
reasonableness
was
first
being
formulated
and
the
morrisdale
case
came
up
at
about
the
same
time
as
the
mitchell
case
to
which
is
of
course
a
leading
case.
and
morrisdale's
lawyers
seeing
their
cause
of
action
going
glimmering
said,
“well,
all
right.
if
we
can't
have
the
district
court,
the
circuit
court
as
it
then
was
determine
the
question
of
reasonableness
at
least
let
us
suspend
so
that
we
can
go
back
to
the
commission.”
and
this
court
said,
“sorry.
your
time
for
going
to
the
commission
has
expired.”
now,
it
is
said
by
the
government
here,
while
the
government
is
different.
this
is
a
judicial
reference.
well,
now
supposed
that
the
court
of
claims
had
exceeded
to
my
brother's
request
had
suspended
the
proceedings
said
“okay.
you
ask
the
commission.”
well,
what
would
the
commission
have
done
when
the
government
had
come
in
there
for
a
determination?
it
would
have
thrown
the
government
out
on
its
sovereign
here
because
under
a
long
line
of
cases
the
government
stood
in
no
different
position.
“well,”
says
the
government,
but
here
the
--
the
--
this
is
different,
the
shippers
in
these
other
cases
were
seeking
affirmative
relief.
we
are
not
seeking
a
affirmative
relief,
we
are
defending,
wrong.
here,
the
government
is
seeking
affirmative
relief
in
three
different
aspects.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
have
indicated
if
there
was
such
a
suspension
and
they
went
over
to
the
commission,
they'd
be
asking
affirmative
relief.
in
fact,
i
think
whenever
anyone
assails
the
lawfulness
of
a
published
rate
which
until
set
aside
as
of
course
the
legal
rate,
he
is
seeking
affirmative
relief
and
more
specifically,
the
court
of
claims
and
only
very
recently
the
first
circuit
have
held
that
where
the
issue
before
the
court
has
to
do
with
the
lawfulness
of
the
deductions
made
by
the
general
accounting
office,
it
is
the
government
which
is
in
the
position
of
seeking
affirmative
relief
because
it
is
seeking
to
justify
the
set
offs
it
has
made.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
unfairness.
i
don't
know
if
we
advanced
analysis
by
bonding
about
epithets
like
unjust,
unfair,
discriminatory,
i
propose
every
losing
litigant
feels
that
he
was
dealt
with
unfairly
otherwise
he
wouldn't
try
to
take
it
up
farther.
but
is
it
unfair?
is
it
unfair
to
say
that
the
government
that
if
you
invoke
the
--
the
--
the
blunt
techniques
of
the
general
accounting
office
and
i
will
show
in
a
minute
just
how
blunt
they
are.
if
you
invoke
those
--
those
techniques
in
cases
which
you
say
are
so
important
that
they're
a
fit
subject
to
this
court
on
certiorari.
is
it
unfair
that
when
you
get
licked
on
it
and
you've
waived
your
right
to
go
to
the
commission
a
court
says,
“you
can't
go
to
the
commission”?
and
of
course
on
the
question
of
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations,
i
think,
the
answer
there
is
that
the
government
could
have
raised
it
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
they
didn't
raise
it.
it
isn't
open
here.
its
not
jurisdiction
--
jurisdictional
in
the
constitutional
sense,
these
are
rulings
that
have
stood
for
30
years
just
as
the
contrary
rulings
of
the
government
isn't
bound
by
limitations
when
it
sues
for
overcharges
twice.
seven
years
ago,
the
petition
was
denied.
if
the
government
can
now
reopen
denied
petitions
after
seven
years,
i
dare
say
that
a
lot
of
other
litigants
would
like
to
be
in
that
position.
i
come
now
to
the
question
of
classification.
it
was
stipulated
at
the
trial
of
these
three
cases.
it
was
at
the
pre-trial
conference
in
one
case,
in
the
western
pacific
and
the
--
request
for
admissions
in
the
other
two
that
these
articles
were
just
the
same
as
those
shipped
in
the
earlier
incendiary
bomb
case,
the
union
pacific
case
in
125th
court
of
claims.
now,
the
government
says
after
we
have
pointed
to
the
findings
in
the
union
pacific
case,
the
present
cases
are
therefore
entirely
different
from
union
pacific
and
respondents
attempt
to
rely
on
the
decision
rendered
on
the
record
as
developed
in
the
latter
case
is
plainly
unwarranted.
i
would
like
to
know
when
it
is
unwarranted
to
rely
on
the
stipulation
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
stipulation
as
to
the
western
pacific
case
is
record
5,
item
2.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
--
in
the
other
cases
we've
been
--
i
mentioned
it
in
the
brief.
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
request
for
admissions.
never
--
never
until
the
--
the
reply
brief
here
was
it
ever
suggested
that
that
stipulation
was
of
no
validity.
in
the
--
in
its
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
attacked
the
classification
made
by
the
court
of
claims
on
the
ground
that
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
effect
of
the
stipulation
was
that
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
shipments
here
and
in
determining
whether
there
was
any
question
of
fact
left
open
by
reason
of
the
affidavits
filed
below
in
response
--
in
opposition
to
the
carriers'
motion
for
summary
judgment
whether
there
was
any
question
of
fact.
and
we
show
in
the
brief
that
every
factual
--
relevant
factual
finding
made
by
the
court
of
claims
in
the
up
case
is
covered
by
the
affidavits
so
that
therefore
there
is
no
question
of
the
fact
open.
and
we
also
say
that
the
question
whether
there
is
question
of
fact
open,
not
having
been
brought
--
raised
in
the
petition
isn't
open
here
but
were
--
were
answering
it
because
were
not
afraid
of
it.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
that's
the
substance
of
--
of
good
deal
of
the
reply
brief,
i
say
that
the
present
cases
are
entirely
different
from
union
pacific
and
respondents
attempt
to
rely
on
the
decision
rendered
on
the
record
as
developed
in
the
latter
case
is
plainly
unwarranted.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
that's
--
that's
the
way
i
read
his
brief.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
on
page
8.
and
it
says
obviously,
the
court
of
claims
--
opinion
in
union
pacific
does
not
justify
deprivation
of
the
government's
right
to
a
day
in
court
and
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
instant
cases
in
which
an
entirely
different
record
was
developed.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
only
points
urged
for
differences
are
points
that
are
covered
in
the
union
pacific
case.
one
of
the
great
--
one
of
the
chords
of
this
crescendo
waive
is
that
napalm
gel,
the
jellied
gasoline
is
not
incendiary
in
the
sense
of
not
being
self-igniting.
well,
that
was
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
union
pacific
case.
another
point
is
that
the
safety
regulations
don't
apply
and
that
i
take
it
is
a
question
of
law.
now,
if
i
may
briefly
turn
to
the
issues
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
well,
the
articles
are
the
same
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
yes.
now,
i
turn
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
how
what?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
there's
a
stipulation
that
the
articles
are
the
same
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
know,
but
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no.
i
--
i'm
not
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
articles
are
the
same
in
fact.
and
now,
i'll
address
myself
to
the
proposition
that
the
union
pacific
decision
is
correct.
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
the
way
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
read
their
point
brief,
beginning
at
page
8
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
of
their
reply
brief.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
it's
about

it's
about

it's
several
pages,
your
honor.
it

brief

it

it
runs
over
to
the
middle
of
page

and
that's
a
rather
a
long
piece
to
read
out
of
the
30
minute
allotment
for
time.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
its
there.
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
i
--
i
don't
read
that
as
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
read
--
read
that
as
precluding
they're
arguing
the
law
and
that's
the
point
i
would
like
--
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
now,
the
basic
principle
followed
by
the
court
of
claims
is
a
well-settled
principle,
namely,
that
the
absence
of
essential
parts
not
affecting
the
identity
of
an
article
offered
for
transportation
doesn't
destroy
its
fundamental
character
from
the
tariff's
standpoint.
also,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
combination
rule
didn't
apply.
there
is
a
very
compelling
reason
why
the
combination
rule
doesn't
apply
and
it's
this.
the
combination
rule
applies
--
does
not
apply
to
articles
having
the
characteristic
of
an
entity
and
these
incendiary
bombs
without
bursters
or
fuses
do
have
the
characteristic
of
an
entity
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
you
cannot
accept
with
great
difficulty,
get
the
jellied
gasoline
out
of
the
bomb
case
once
it
has
been
put
in
and
second
there
is
no
known
method
by
which
the
jellied
gasoline
can
be
separated
into
its
component
parts
of
napalm
soap
powder
and
liquid
gasoline.
therefore,
the
articles
have
the
characteristic
of
an
entity
and
therefore,
the
combination
rule
does
not
apply.
there
is
another
argument
made
by
the
government
that
these
articles
as
shipped
are
not
subject
to
the
i.c.c.'s
safety
regulations.
we
think
they
are
because
the
i.c.c.
safety
regulations
cover
a
great
many
classes
of
articles
not
only
the
highly
hazardous
but
also
those
lesser.
if
it
is
material
we
can
file
a
supplemental
memorandum
tracing
this
particular
item
through
some
seven
titles,
a
very
complicated
and
involved
i.c.c.
regulations
published
in
49
c.f.r.
but
it
doesn't
ask
for
this
reason.
this
court
has
held
in
the
case
characteristically
not
cited
or
discussed
by
the
government
that
whether
or
not
a
particular
article
is
subject
to
the
safety
regulations
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
its
classification
for
tariff
purposes.
that's
the
gulf
refining
case
from
the
268th
united
states.
so
that
applying
--
applying
those
set
of
rules
of
classification
that
first
that
the
absence
of
essential
parts
doesn't
affect
the
character
of
the
shipment.
second,
that
the
combination
rule
is
not
applicable
to
articles
having
the
characteristic
of
many.
and
third,
that
the
applicability
or
otherwise
of
the
safety
regulations
has
noting
to
do
with
tariff
classification,
the
answer
is
clear
of
the
court
of
claims
correctly
classified
these
shipments
as
incendiary
bombs.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
this
is
a
simple
question
of
classification
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
the
--
the
court
of
claims
or
the
district
court
under
the
tucker
act
is
the
only
place
where
the
railroads
could
go
to
recover
the
deductions
because
the
i.c.c.
has
no
power
to
--
has
no
jurisdiction
to
award
judgment
for
undercharges.
i
mean
this
is
not
the
--
this
is
not
the
--
a
dispute
between
the
shipper
and
the
railroad
over
a
bill.
the
bill
has
been
presented,
the
bill
has
been
paid.
the
comptroller
general
has
made
the
deduction
and
the
only
remedy
the
--
the
--
carrier
has
is
to
sue
the
government
to
recover
the
deductions
and
when
it's
a
--
and
there
are
only
two
tribunals
one
would
be
the
district
court
and
since
these
--
these
claims
are
an
excess
of
$10,000
they've
got
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
and
that
jurisdiction
has
never
been
questioned
but
it
doesn't
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
but
--
but
that's
simply
under
the
great
northern
case,
the
question
of
an
interpretation
and
there
are
tools
at
hand.
these
rules
of
classification
that
had
been
developed
by
the
commission
which
we
have
set
out
at,
perhaps,
undue
length
in
our
brief
because
of
the
government's
silence
on
them
doesn't
make
it
possible
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion.
and
the
only
point
that
isn't
open
to
the
court
is
whether
having
regard
to
the
admittedly
less
hazardous
feature
of
these
bombs
shipped
the
way
they
were,
the
rate
is
or
is
not
reasonable
and
as
to
that
there's
a
limitation.
now
there's
also
an
estoppel
point
but
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
your
honor.
because
then
they
would
be
empty
bombs
--
bomb
cases.
there's
a
special
rate
tariff
for
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
they
were
certainly
more
dangerous
than
gasoline
when
they
were
dropped
from
our
airplanes
on
enemy
cities.
but
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
--
whether
this
gel,
this
fearsome
napalm
gel
is
more
dangerous
or
less
dangerous
than
the
--
than
the
plain
gasoline,
i
don't
know.
that
would
be
a
question
for
--
that's
a
question
of
a
--
a
factor
of
hazard
to
be
considered
by
the
commission
in
a
proper
proceeding
along
with
all
the
other
complex
and
multifarious
factors
that
go
to
make
up
the
--
the
reasonableness
of
the
record.
and
--
and
if
--
if
as
the
government
said
in
its
petition
this
--
this
is
such
a
recurring
problem,
this
involved
so
many
shipments,
this
is
so
vital
to
the
government
they
could
have
gone
to
the
commission
the
moment
the
first
bill
was
presented
back
in
1944.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
says
incendiary
bombs
but
i
think
it
is
more
fully
covered
in
our
brief.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
its
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
language
of
the
tariff
appears
in
the
government's
brief
at
pages
30
and
31
and
it's
items
--
it's
item
1820.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
these
were
in
packages.
1820
is
and
1800
is
ammunition
explosive
or
incendiary.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
this
is
incendiary.
this
is
incendiary
ammunition
at
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
1820.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
1820
which
is
a
subhead
under
item
1800.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
an
incendiary
bomb.
the
court
of
claims
found
it
had
no
purpose
other
than
incendiary
bombs
now.
and
the
court
of
claims
in
the
union
pacific
case
held
that
is
was
incendiary
even
though
it
found
as
a
fact
that
it
wasn't
self-igniting
because
it
was
an
explosive
ammunition
that
would
be
shrapnel
high
explosive.
it
wasn't
a
gas
smoke,
it
wasn't
tear-producing.
incendiary
was
the
only
classification.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
judge
madden's
dissent
with
all
deference
simply
comes
down
to
a
--
to
a
feeling.
well,
let's
look
into
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
and
that's
all
in
the
world
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
no.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
no.
we
never
agreed
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
we
--
we
agreed
it
wasn't
self-igniting.
we
don't
question
the
findings.
it's
not
self-igniting
but
as
a
matter
of
tariff
classification
that's
an
incendiary
bomb,
all
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
work
is
for
a
gi
out
in
the
field
to
screw
in
the
first
term
fuse
and
take
off
the
arming
wire
and
there
it
is.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
out
in
the
field.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
right.
but
under
a
--
under
an
unbroken
line
of
ruling,
the
absence
of
essential
parts
doesn't
destroy
the
character
of
an
article
offered
for
transportation
even
though
it
won't
work
without
those
articles.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
under
the
--
under
the
--
under
a
long
line
of
--
of
ruling
is
in
accordance
and
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
can
reach
it
two
ways.
one,
the
absence
of
incendiary
--
of
essential
parts
doesn't
affect
its
character
and
the
second
is
analog
--
the
rule
of
analogy,
it's
more
nearly
analogous
to
an
incendiary
bomb
than
it
is
to
an
empty
bomb.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
it
--
it
--
burns
much
more
fiercely.
it
burns
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
i
would
say
probably
about
the
same
except
there
may
not
be
that
the
--
the
fumes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
rate
on
gasoline
i
think
is
fifth-class
and
the
rate
on
napalm
powder
is
fifth-class
and
the
rate
on
--
on
the
empty
cases
is
fifth-class,
none
constant
that
the
rate
on
the
combination
which
has
the
characteristic
of
an
entity
should
be
fifth-class
also.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
right.
yes.
and
--
and
that's
perfectly
clear
and
--
and
if
--
if
that
is
thought
to
be
an
--
an
unreasonable
rate,
the
way
was
open
but
the
way
to
--
the
way
to
deal
with
unreasonable
rates
is
not
to
have
the
comptroller
general
say
it
that
the
combination
rule
applies
when
it
doesn't.
i
mean
against
that
kind
of
administrative
arbitrariness
the
carrier
is
entitled
to
resort
to
a
court.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
carrier
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
because
this
court
and
the
commission
have
said
for
many,
many
years
going
back
to
about
1910
that
the
limitation
for
going
to
the
commission
on
a
claim
of
unreasonableness
bars
the
power
of
the
commission.
now,
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
that
that
is
something
congress
ought
to
look
in
to
but
here
for
--
for
nearly
50
years
its
been
held
without
even
a
recorded
dissenting
vote
that
this
is
jurisdiction,
it
bars
the
power
of
the
commission.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
the
--
i
would
say
the
morrisdale
case
from
the
230th
of
u.s.
have
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
when
it
--
when
you
--
when
it
come
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
our
precise
case.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
morrisdale
case,
230
u.s.
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that's
the
only
case
i
know
of
but
it
has
never
been
questioned
and
it
was
explained
later
on
in
the
footnote
as
saying,
“well,
no
reference
was
ordered
there
because
no
rights
could
be
saved
thereby.
the
reason
being
at
the
time
had
expired
and
the
commission
was
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.”

mr.

well,
the
--
mr.
frederick

pardon
me.
mr.
frederick

yes,
your

mr.
frederick

oh,
i
don't
know,
it
hasn't
changed
much.
i
mean
it's

and
re-filed
but
i
--
it's
--
it's
been
--
it
was
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
“yes”
because
the
bills,
the
carrier's
bills
which
are
in
the
record
show
the
shipment
of
so
and
so
many
crates
of
incendiary
bombs,
np1
without
bursters
or
fuses
and
was
billed
in
item
1
--1820.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
back
in
1944
when
the
shipments
were
made.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
sir.

mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
in
--
in
--
in
all
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
--
in
all
three
cases,
the
carriers
billed
the
government
at
the
higher
rate.
in
the
western
pacific
case,
the
government
paid
at
the
lower
rate.
in
bangor
and
aroostook
and
seaboard
the
government
paid
at
the
higher
rate
and
then
sometime
later
the
comptroller
general
made
or
authorized
deductions
against
subsequent
bills.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
--
but
under
the
--
under
the
saint
louis
and
brownsville,
the
mere
fact
of
waiting
for
the
period
of
limitations
does
not
constitute
gross
acquiescence
so
as
to
bar
the
carrier.
