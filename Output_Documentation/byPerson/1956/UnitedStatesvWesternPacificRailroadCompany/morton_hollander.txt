mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
number
18
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
petitioner
is
the
united
states.
respondents
are
three
rail
carriers,
the
western
pacific,
bangor
and
aroostook
and
seaboard.
these
three
carriers
instituted
this
litigation
by
filing
suits
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims
contending
that
they
had
been
underpaid
for
certain
shipments
transported
by
the
government
over
the
lines
of
these
carriers
during
world
war
ii
and
the
korean
conflict.
the
next
case
which
will
be
called
on
the
calendar,
number
19,
united
states
against
chesapeake
and
ohio
emerges
out
of
a
somewhat
similar
factual
background
in
the
sense
that
that
case
too
represents
a
carrier
claim
for
underpayment
against
the
united
states.
that
case
came
out
of
the
district
court
and
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
both
of
these
cases
present
this
basic
question
as
to
the
effect
to
be
given
section
16
(3),
the
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
prescribes
a
two-year
period
of
limitation.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
claims,
number
18
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
number
19,
applied
this
statute
in
a
fashion
which
was
unjust
and
discriminatory
as
far
as
the
united
states,
as
a
shipper
is
concerned.
now,
let
me
give
you
the
factual
background
in
number
18,
the
western
pacific
case.
in
1944,
in
1948
and
in
1950,
the
government
shipped
over
the
lines
of
these
three
carriers
about
200
shipments
of
steel
bomb
body
cases
filled
with
napalm
gel.
i'd
like
to
explain
exactly
what
these
shipments
consisted
of
because
the
--
the
makeup
and
the
ingredients
of
these
particular
shipments
account
--
accounted
for
the
original
filing
of
these
suits
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
shipment
says,
i
have
said
consisted
of
steel
bomb
body
cases
filled
with
napalm
gel.
napalm
gel
is
ordinary
liquid
gasoline
that
has
been
solidified
or
thickened
by
the
addition
of
a
soap
powder
known
in
the
trade
as
napalm.
the
addition
of
the
soap
powder
to
the
gasoline
does
not
work
any
chemical
change
in
the
net
product;
the
thickened
gasoline,
it
simply
changes
its
physical
state
by
converting
it
from
a
liquid
to
a
solid,
thickened
and
adhesive
form.
the
addition
of
this
napalm
to
the
gasoline
in
no
way
makes
the
gasoline
any
more
hazardous
certainly
than
it
was
before.
in
fact,
the
addition
of
the
napalm
that
thickened
it
to
the
gasoline
by
solidifying
the
liquid
gasoline
makes
these
shipments
relatively
far
safer
from
a
transportation
as
they
point
their
view
because
there
is
eliminated
any
possibility
of
leakage.
there
is
eliminated
any
possibility
of
spillage
and
of
course
there
isn't
anywhere
as
near
as
much
vaporization
from
the
thickened,
solidified
gel
as
there
is
from
the
liquid
gasoline.
our
basic
position
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
classification
rate
at
which
these
shipments
are
eligible
to
travel
is
that
the
shipments
should
not
--
the
shipments
were
eligible
for
transportation
at
a
rate
denominated
in
the
freight
tariffs
as
a
fifth-class
rate.
we
base
our
position
on
the
fact
that
steel
bomb
body
cases
themselves
are
regularly
carried
at
the
fifth-class
rate,
gasoline
has
always
been
carried
at
the
fifth-class
rate
and
the
napalm
itself
is
aluminum
soap
powder
which
is
used
as
the
thickener
has
always
been
carried
at
the
fifth-class
rate.
since
all
of
these
items
were
eligible
for
carriage
at
the
fifth-class
rate,
our
position
has
been
that
when
the
gel
is
added
or
poured
into
the
steel
bomb
body
cases,
the
transportation
rate
should
be
no
higher
than
fifth-class.
especially,
since
the
addition
of
the
thickener
to
the
gasoline
as
i
have
pointed
out
actually
makes
the
shipment
far
safer
from
the
transportation
point
of
view.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no
--
no,
there
is
--
it's
--
it's
not
in
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
only
items
shipped
in
these
cases,
the
only
ingredients
shipped
in
these
cases
were
the
empty
steel
shell
and
into
which
was
poured
this
thickened
gasoline.
there
were
no
fuses.
there
were
no
bursters.
a
completed
incendiary
bomb
in
order
for
it
to
function
effectively
on
the
field
must
have
the
fuse
and
must
in
addition
have
a
burster
which
includes
both
an
incendiary
agent
as
well
as
an
explosive,
tnt.
now,
it's
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
burster
charge
which
includes
both
the
explosive
and
the
incendiary
agent,
the
white
phosphorous
were
not
included
within
these
shipments.
all
we
have
in
these
shipments
is
this
thickened
gasoline
plus
the
steel
bomb
body
cases
and
we
say
that
since
a
gasoline
itself
should
be
--
is
always
transported
at
fifth,
the
napalm
concededly
is
transported
at
fifth
and
the
steel
bomb
body
case
is
transported
at
fifth-class
rate,
that's
the
rate
that
we
were
entitled
to
and
we
paid
the
carriers
on
that
basis
either
originally
or
by
deductions
from
later
bills
submitted
by
them.
the
carriers
on
the
other
hand
consistently
have
maintained
that
what
were
shipped
in
these
cases
should
have
been
shipped
at
the
relatively
higher
first
class
rate,
a
rate
approximately
three
times
in
dollars
and
cents
higher
than
the
fifth-class
rate
which
the
government
paid.
their
position
--
their
position
is
that
the
--
the
closest
--
the
closest
way
you
can
describe
these
articles
is
by
calling
them
incendiary
bombs
because
--
and
it
is
not
disputed
that
that
was
the
ultimate
use
to
which
they
were
going
to
be
put
in
the
field
of
battle
after
however
the
incendiary
agent;
the
white
phosphorus
was
added
after
the
explosive
element,
the
tnt
was
added
and
after
the
fuse
was
added
but
none
of
these
latter
three
component
parts
necessary
to
the
effective
functioning
of
these
commodity
as
an
incendiary
bomb
were
included
in
any
of
these
shipments.
mr.
morton
hollander
that
--
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
two
questions
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
it
was
a
question
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
and
we
argued
in
the
court
of
claims.
in
the
court
of
claims
the
carrier
is
asserting
that
this
higher
firstclass
rate
applies
moot
for
summary
judgment.
we
resisted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
first
of
all,
on
the
ground
that
there
was
actually
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
as
to
what
was
involved
in
these
shipments.
they
said
that
these
were
incendiary
bombs.
we
pointed
out
that
no
they're
not
incendiary
bombs.
we
had
uncontroverted
affidavits,
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
we
presented
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that
was
one
of
--
that
was
not
--
not
initially,
your
honor.
our
position
was
that
if
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
the
higher
first
class
rates
applied
even
though
there
was
nothing
explosive,
nothing
hazardous,
nothing
incendiary
about
these
shipments,
we
felt
that
the
potential
application
of
the
high
first
class
rates
to
this
relatively
innocuous
shipments
posed
a
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
application
of
these
high
first
class
rates
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
to
this
shipment
and
--
yes,
that
was
an
issue.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor
that
was
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
the
matter
of
common
--
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
we
believe
that
--
we
believe
that
the
--
the
clear
language
--
the
--
the
clear
language
of
--
of
the
item
governing
the
high
first
class
rates
by
definition
excluded
this
shipments
because
we
argue
that
this
weren't
incendiary,
they
were
relatively
so
free
from
any
hazard
that
the
bureau
of
explosives
carrier
organization
which
polices
the
interstate
commerce
commissions'
regulations
on
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles
has
ruled
that
the
type
of
shipment
involved
here
does
not
even
come
within
the
purview
of
the
i.c.c.
regulation.
mr.
morton
hollander
with
respect
--
with
respect,
your
honor,
to
the
initial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
low
fifth-class
rate
or
the
higher
first
class
rate
applies.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
however
--
however,
we
argued
in
the
court
of
claims
that
if
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
the
high
first
class
rate
must
upon
a
reading
of
the
tariff
be
applied
to
these
particular
shipments
then
we
argue
that
there
was
a
question
of
reasonableness.
and
at
that
point
we
suggested
that
the
court
of
claims
was
--
was
obligated
to
suspend
the
judicial
proceedings
and
give
us
an
opportunity
to
go
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
establish
the
unreasonableness
of
applying
this
high
first
class
rates
to
the
relatively
safe
and
innocuous
shipments
involved.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
if
--
if
on
the
--
if
on
the
face
of
the
tariffs
without
resorting
to
any
extrinsic
aids,
it's
possible
for
the
--
for
a
court
to
place
one
tariff
in
juxtaposition
with
another
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
tariff
rate
a
rather
than
tariff
rate
b
applies.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
--
an
appropriate
question
for
a
resolution
by
a
court.
it
need
not
be
referred
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
in
this
case
--
in
this
case
we
--
we
did
agree,
both
sides
were
in
agreement
that
it
would
be
possible
to
read
this
tariff
for
a
court,
to
read
this
tariff
and
come
to
the
correct
conclusion.
mr.
morton
hollander
and
we
felt
however
--
i'm
sorry.
your
honor?
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
i
--
i
think
the
carrier
--
it
could
have
moved
in
the
court
of
claims
for
a
suspension
of
the
judicial
proceedings
in
order
to
allow
the
court
of
claims
to
refer
the
question
of
--
of
possible
unreasonableness
of
the
application
of
the
low
fifth-class
rates
to
these
shipments.
however,
that
was
never
suggested
in
this
case
and
there
has
never
been
any
contention
in
this
case
by
the
carriers
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
apply
the
lower
fifth-class
rates.
their
--
their
argument
is,
i
think
judge
madden
quite
accurately
points
out
in
his
dissent
is
simply
this
that
the
nearest
way
you
can
describe
these
shipments
is
to
call
them
incendiary
bombs
ergo
the
high
rate
applies.
judge
madden
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
it
is
really
was
the
--
the
extreme
literal
reading
of
any
tariff
rate
which
took
into
account,
not
at
all,
the
purpose
for
which
these
high
rates
were
originally
designed
namely
to
actually
work
and
give
the
carrier
benefit
of
an
insurance
premium
against
the
tremendous
risk
of
potential
liability
entailed
in
the
carriage
of
articles
which
are
truly
hazardous,
truly
explosive
and
truly
incendiary.
and
he
points
out
in
his
opinion
that
by
applying
the
fifth
--
the
first
class
rates
as
the
court
of
claims
did
in
this
case
to
these
shipments,
the
carriers
are
--
are
getting
a
pure
win
for
they're
being
paid
for
expenses
they
do
not
incur,
expenses
ordinarily
required
to
be
incurred
by
carriers
when
they
are
carrying
goods
which
are
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
regulations
on
explosives
and
other
dangerous
articles.
when
they
are
carrying
goods,
which
have
to
be
packed,
which
have
to
be
stored,
which
have
to
be
braced,
which
have
to
be
blocked
in
a
certain
way,
articles
from
which
only
the
finest
type
of
--
of
rolling
equipment
can
be
used.
all
of
those
expenses
were
not
and
are
not
incurred
by
the
carriers
in
this
case.
judge
madden's
dissent
very
firmly
points
out
that
the
only
justification
for
these
high
first
class
rates
are
these
extraordinary
expenses
which
are
not
entailed
here.
for
that
reason,
judge
madden
concluded
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
the
carriers
are
really
getting
something
for
nothing.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
believe
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
that
of
course,
your
honor,
that
our
basic
position
--
our
basic
position
in
the
court
of
claims
as
i
say
was
first,
that
as
a
matter
of
tariff
construction,
the
court
of
claims
could
find
that
the
lower
fifth-class
rates
applied.
we
also
argued
that
if
they
were
of
the
view
that
these
high
first
class
rates
applied
then
they
should
have
suspended
proceedings
and
referred
the
case
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
what
the
court
of
claims
did
was
this.
they
said,
“no
we
disagree
with
you.
the
high
first
class
rates
applied
and
we
will
not
refer
this
case
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.”
we
recognize
that
ordinarily
when
a
question
of
reasonableness
is
posed
during
litigation
of
this
order,
it's
all
together
appropriate,
it's
mandatory
for
the
court
to
stay
its
hand,
hold
the
judicial
proceedings
in
advance
and
refer
the
reasonableness
question
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
here
the
court
of
claims
did
not
see
fit
to
do
that.
instead
they
said,
“while
we
recognize
that
ordinarily
you,
the
government,
the
shipper
in
this
case
would
have
a
right
to
have
your
claim
of
unreasonableness
determined
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.”
here,
they
told
us,
“you
came
in
too
late.
you
came
in
too
late.”
two-year
period
of
section
16
(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
set
forth
in
page
3
of
our
brief,
bars
any
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
even
though
this
is
ordinarily
a
matter
appropriate
for
commission
determination.
and
that
ruling
--
that
ruling
actually
forms
the
--
forms
the
framework
for
the
principal
question
on
appeal
here.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
claims
--
the
court
of
claims
committed
not
only
reversible
but
egregious
error
in
this
rule
--
in
ruling
that
we
were
barred
from
going
to
the
i.c.c.
because
of
the
passage
of
that
two-year
period.
we
believe
first
that
the
unfairness
of
the
result
reached
by
the
i.c.c.
actually
condemns
the
ruling.
we
also
believe
that
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
section
16
(3),
not
a
--
not
a
word,
not
a
syllable
in
section
16
(3)
which
compels
the
unfair
result
arrived
at
by
the
court
of
claims.
finally,
we
believe
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
claims
completely
ignored
the
special
position
occupied
by
the
united
states
in
its
traditional
sovereign
immunity
from
statute
of
limitations
of
all
sorts.
and
i
would
like
at
the
present
time
to
address
my
argument
to
that
branch
of
the
case.
first
of
all,
the
unfairness
of
the
result,
the
court
of
claims
has
consistently
ruled
since
1926
that
despite
the
language
in
section
16
(3)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
section
which
imposes
a
two-year
limitation
on
carriers
when
they
want
to
file
suit
against
shippers
for
underpayments
which
was
what
was
involved
in
this
case,
the
carrier
suit
against
the
shipper
for
an
underpayment.
section
16
(3)
(a)
says,
the
carrier
has
two
years
to
do
that.
what
has
the
court
of
claims
done
with
that
section?
it's
ignored
it
and
ripped
it
off
the
books
completely.
it
says
that
this
section
which
by
its
terms
applies
to
all
actions
that
law
by
carriers
has
no
application
to
suits
by
carriers
against
the
united
states.
against
the
united
states,
the
carrier
has
a
much
longer
period,
three
times
as
long,
six
years.
now,
when
the
united
states
comes
into
court
and
has
to
defend
as
it
did
in
this
case,
suits
filed
almost
six
years,
suits
filed
by
the
carriers
almost
six
years
after
the
causes
of
actions
accrued.
in
western
pacific
for
example,
the
shipments
took
place
in
1948
and
1950.
payment
was
promptly
made
at
that
time
at
the
lower
fifth-class
rate
contended
by
the
government
to
apply.
the
carriers
held
back,
not
for
two
years,
not
for
four
years
but
for
almost
six
years
and
in
1954,
they
filed
these
suits
against
the
united
states
far
later
than
the
two-year
period
which
ordinarily
would
have
barred
their
actions
against
us
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
says,
“well,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
carrier.
you
have
a
much
longer
period.”
but
when
we
raised
the
question
of
reasonableness,
i
think,
this
is
of
crucial
significance
because
everybody
concedes,
both
parties
concede,
the
court
of
claims
recognized
that
if
we
were
able
to
establish
our
defense
of
unreasonableness
of
the
application
of
the
high
first
class
rates
to
these
shipments,
there
is
no
question
--
there
is
no
question
a
judgment
would
ultimately
have
had
to
go
for
the
united
states
in
these
cases.
everybody
concedes
it.
everybody
concedes
furthermore
that
the
question
of
reasonableness
is
one
exclusively
for
i.c.c.
determination.
we're
on
common
ground
there.
we're
also
on
common
ground
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
that
--
and
this
is
--
this
is
where
i'm
common
ground
with
respondents
and
with
the
court
of
claims,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
to
refer.
we
have
a
right
to
have
the
question
of
reasonableness
referred
to
the
commission
whenever
the
question
is
raised
during
pendency
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
those
principles
are
well-established,
there's
no
dispute.
the
court
of
claims
says
to
the
government,
“no.
you're
too
late
for
a
referral.
two-year
period
prescribed
by
section
16
(3)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
applies
to
complaints
by
shippers
against
carriers,
that
two-year
period
has
gone
by.
you're
out
of
luck.”
and
--
and
the
court
of
claims
--
the
--
the
court
of
claims'
reasoning
--
the
court
of
claims'
reasoning
is
--
is
actually
--
actually
comes
down
to
nothing
more
than
that.
the
opinion
makes
very
plain
that
the
only
reason
the
court
of
claims
refused
to
let
us
go
to
the
commission
for
a
determination
of
the
reasonableness
question
was
because
this
same
two-year
period
which
they
have
refused
to
invoked
against
the
carriers
to
bar
their
suits
against
us.
they
say
that,
“that
two-year
period
nevertheless
prevents
you
from
establishing
the
defensive
unreasonableness
before
the
i.c.c.”
the
only
body
authorized
to
pass
on
such
a
question
of
unreasonableness.
now,
we
believe
that
as
i
said
before
that
the
very
result,
the
very
unfairness
of
this
result
condemns
it.
now
perhaps,
if
there
was
something
in
the
language
of
section
16
(3)
which
compelled,
which
--
which
actually
compel
that
--
that
conclusion
it
might
as
the
respondents
say;
“be
a
matter
for
--
for
a
legislative
--
for
a
legislative
consideration
for
potential
legislative
remedy.”
perhaps,
if
the
language
were
really
as
strong
as
that
maybe
the
court's
hands
are
tight.
but
if
--
if
your
honors
would
read
section
16
(3)
(b),
the
section
relied
on
by
the
court
of
claims,
you
will
see
that
first
of
all
it
doesn't
refer
at
all
to
anything
but
independent
reparation
proceedings
filed
by
a
shipper
against
the
carrier.
not
a
syllable,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
covers
the
situation
we
have
here
where
on
the
assumption
of
the
court
of
claims
itself,
the
action
was
timely
filed
and
we
were
trying
to
get
a
referral
on
the
basis
and
as
an
incident
of
this
timely
filed
judicial
proceeding.
nothing
in
section
16
(3)
(b),
your
honors,
in
anyway
impinges
upon
the
power
of
a
court
as
an
incident
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
timely
filed
before
it
and
that
of
course
was
the
view
of
the
court
of
claims,
carrier's
actions
were
timely
filed
before
it.
nothing
in
section
16
(3)
(b)
in
anyway
impinges
on
the
right
of
the
court
to
make
a
referral.
actually,
if
the
court
is
entertaining
the
affirmative
claim
by
the
carrier
against
the
shipper,
it
--
it
would
seem
to
us
to
follow
it
as
a
necessary
corollary
that
that
the
court
must
give
us
an
opportunity
to
establish
our
defenses,
not
this
--
mr.
morton
hollander
there
would
not
be
this
problem
--
mr.
morton
hollander
there
would
not
be
this
problem.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
problem
because
this
is
how
the
carriers
meet
our
argument
--
our
argument
of
unfairness
or
they
say,
“well,
we're
not
being
unfair
to
you.”
why?
they're
private
shippers
in
the
same
box.
now,
even
if
that
were
so,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
private
shippers
as
at
disadvantage
requires
the
--
the
perpetuation
of
the
injustice
by
extension
to
the
united
states
as
a
shipper.
but
the
fact
is
that
that
is
not
so
because
as
against
the
private
shipper,
the
carrier
would
have
to
file
within
two
years.
if
the
carrier
filed
against
the
private
shipper
within
two
years
even
respondents
concede
that
their
action
would
be
thrown
out
as
being
barred
by
section
16
(3)
(a).
so,
the
carrier
has
the
filing
as
to
private
shipper
in
two
years
that
affords
the
opportunity
to
the
private
shipper
to
go
before
the
commission
within
that
same
period
of
time.
mr.
morton
hollander
this
--
this
your
honor
is
because
the
court
of
claims
has
refused
to
apply
the
section
16
(3)
(a)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
right.
it's
not
only
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
have
the
same
result
following
in
the
other
case
next
to
be
considered,
number
19.
the
carrier
there
went
to
the
district
court,
same
result.
two
years
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it's
radically
different,
your
honor.
this
unfair
result
cannot
possibly
materialize
in
the
case
of
a
private
shipper
because
first
of
all,
as
i
say,
the
private
shipper
can
use
as
a
shield
in
defending
an
action
filed
against
him
the
two-year
limitation
period
of
section
16
(3)
(a).
if
the
carrier
files
after
the
two-year
period,
the
private
shipper
has
a
perfect
defense.if
the
carrier
files
against
the
united
states
after
the
two-year
period,
no
defense.
now,
section
16
(3)
goes
even
further
to
protect
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
why
is
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
that's
something
i've
been
trying
to
figure
out,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
the
private
shipper
wouldn't
be
faced
with
this
situation
simply
for
this.
the
carrier
must
file
its
suit
against
the
private
shipper
within
two
years.
as
against
the
united
states,
the
carrier
has
a
much
longer
period
of
time,
six
years,
the
carrier
if
it
wishes
it.
mr.
morton
hollander
this
is
--
this
is
the
court
of
claims'
interpretation
of
section
16
(3)
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
well
as
the
six-year
limitation
period
of
the
tucker
act.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
filed
two
petitions
for
certiorari,
your
honor,
several
years
ago
pointing
out
that
there
--
all
of
the
language
in
section
16
(3)
requires
applications
of
its
limitation
period
to
suits
by
carriers
against
the
united
states.
there
certainly
is
no
language
in
section
16
(3)
in
anyway
indicating
that
the
united
states
is
not
entitled
the
same
benefit
of
the
two-year
limitation
period
any
private
shipper
is
entitled
to.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
section
16
(3).
what
the
court
of
claims
says
that
we
can
ignore
that
because
this
is
the
united
states,
as
far
as
united
states
is
concerned,
we
prefer
to
give
the
carriers
an
opportunity
to
come
in
any
time
within
six
years.
i
--
i
say
too
that
this
--
this
basic
unfairness
that
your
honors
is
--
is
taken
account
of
in
section
16
(3)
itself
as
far
as
a
private
shipper
is
concerned
because
even
if
the
carrier
should
wait
in
an
action
against
the
private
shipper
to
the
last
day
of
the
two-year
period
to
file
his
action
against
the
shipper
section
16
(3)
give
the
shipper
a
locus
poenitentiae
of
90-days
beyond
the
expiration
of
that
two-year
period
in
which
to
file
a
proceeding
before
the
commission.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
language
which
they
ignore,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
and
that
says
all
actions
at
law
by
carriers.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
six-year
period
that
the
court
of
claims
has
ceased
upon
in
order
to
escape
the
impact
of
this
two-year
period
in
carrier
suits
against
the
united
states
is
found
in
the
tucker
act,
in
the
tucker
act.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
general
statute
authorizing
suits
on
contract
claims
and
generally
against
the
united
states,
they
ignored
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
the
specific
provision
that
has
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
they
rely
on
that
and
they
say
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
that's
--
well,
your
honor,
yes.
we
--
we
argue
that
certainly
if
the
court
of
claims
ignores
this
section
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
prevents
us
from
using
it
as
a
shield
to
ward
off
a
late
suit
filed
by
the
carrier
beyond
the
two-year
period.
they
certainly
have
no
business
in
invoking
this
very
same
two-year
limitation
period
to
prevent
us
from
establishing
a
defense
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
in
1954.
mr.
morton
hollander
1954.
mr.
morton
hollander
1954,
your
honor.
the
shipments
took
place
in
1948
and
in
1950,
payment
by
the
government
was
made
promptly
at
those
times
to
the
carriers
in
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
and
the
railroad
sued
the
government
--
mr.
morton
hollander
for
--
pardon?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
claiming
that
they
had
been
overpaid
in
1948
and
in
1950.
mr.
morton
hollander
they're
claiming
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
claiming
that
they
had
been
underpaid.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
paid
them
on
the
basis
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
government's
basic
position,
yes.
we
haven't
underpaid
you.
we
paid
you
every
cent
you
were
entitled
to.if
the
court
of
claims
is
of
the
view
that
the
higher
first
class
rate
applies
then
we
want
to
establish
an
--
mr.
morton
hollander
because
of
the
expiration
--
mr.
morton
hollander
in
short,
your
honor,
all
the
carrier
has
to
do
to
collect
unreasonable
charges
against
the
united
states
as
a
shipper
with
impunity
is
to
wait
for
the
two-year
period
to
go
by
then
file
the
suit,
then
under
the
theory
of
the
court
of
claims
were
stuck.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
--
mr.
morton
hollander
your
honor,
we
did
not
raise
that
question
in
either
the
petition
or
in
the
brief
on
the
merit.
mr.
morton
hollander
if
this
court,
we
--
this
court
we
feel
on
--
on
its
motion
may
inquire
into
the
validity
of
the
underlying
assumption
of
the
court
of
claims
and
its
on
the
basis
of
that
underlying
assumption
that
you
have
consequences
spawned
of
the
type
that
we
confronted
within
this
case.
its
only
because
of
the
court
of
claims'
consistent
holding
that
the
carrier
had
the
benefit
of
the
six
rather
than
the
two-year
period
that
it
was
able
to
deprive
the
government
of
its
right
to
establish
a
defense
of
unreasonableness
because
of
the
passage
of
the
very
same
two-year
period
which
the
court
of
claims
has
held
does
not
apply
for
the
carrier's
affirmative
suit
against
the
united
states.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
your
honor,
we
did
not
raise
that
as
a
question
--
mr.
morton
hollander
we
--
we
fear,
your
honor,
we
challenge
it
in
the
sense
that
we
are
firmly
convinced
that
those
decisions
are
plainly
wrong
and
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
an
unfair
inference.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
believe
that
this
court
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
court
in
its
consideration
of
the
referral
issue
in
weighing
the
arguments
pro
and
con
may
recognize
on
its
own
motion
that
the
--
the
real
source
of
this
difficulty
is
the
court
of
claims'
insistence
on
applying
a
much
longer
period
of
limitations
to
carrier
suits
against
the
united
states.
and
we
believe
--
we
believe
that
this
court
if
it
is
so
inclined
may
examine
to
the
validity
of
that
underlying
assumption
of
the
court
of
claims
and
--
and
if
it
does,
if
it
seeks
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
underlying
assumption,
we
have
set
forth
as
appendices
to
our
briefs,
we've
set
forth
of
all
the
arguments
we've
presented
to
this
court
in
filing
two
petitions
for
certiorari,
both
of
which
were
denied
by
this
court
on
that
question.
so,
that
if
the
court
want
to
examine
into
the
validity
of
that
underlying
assumption
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
the
materials
are
therefore
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
not
essential
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
for
this
court
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
we
want
the
court
to
look
in
to
their
problem
if
it
bothers
the
courts
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
sufficiently
in
its
consideration
of
the
case
as
it
bothers
us.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
morton
hollander
your
honor,
there
are
three
cases
involved
in
this
litigation.
in
the
first
case,
western
pacific,
there
were
no
deductions.
the
government
was
billed
in
1948
and
in
1950
at
the
high
first
class
rate.
the
government
paid
promptly
the
lower
fifth-class
rate
in
1948
and
in
1950.
suit
was
filed
by
the
carrier
in
1954,
four
years
after
the
latest
payment
and
six
years
after
the
earliest
payment.
and
the
other
two
cases
of
bangor
and
aroostook
and
seaboard,
all
of
the
shipments
took
place
in
1944.
the
suit
was
filed
by
the
carrier
in
1954
but
in
that
--
in
those
two
cases
the
government
did
as
colonel
wiener
has
pointed
out,
did
pay
the
carriers
originally
in
1944
at
the
higher
first
class
rate.
later
the
g.a.o.
it's
only
in
these
two
cases
that
the
g.a.o.
took
any
action
of
--
the
g.a.o.
did
make
a
deduction
when,
the
record
is
not
indicated
whether
it
was
within
two
years
prior
to
1954
or
within
six
years
prior
to
1954
that
those
deductions
were
effected
and
those
two
cases
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
in
1944,
they've
paid
at
the
higher
first
class
rate
promptly
then
they
exercised
the
statutory
right
to
recoupment.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
don't
know
the
--
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
percentage
of
cases
in
which
it
is
necessary
for
the
government
to
exercise
this
right
of
recoupment.
actually
this
is
really
a
provision
that
the
carriers
were
insisting
on
putting
in
the
1940
transportation
act
because
before
that
time
the
carriers
did
not
get
prompt
payment,
they
had
to
wait
until
final
audit
by
the
general
accounting
office
that
they
complained
took
too
long
a
period.
they
were
able
to
persuade
congress
to
require
the
government
to
pay
promptly,
even
if
the
government
had
some
doubt
as
to
the
appropriate
classification.
and
then
the
carriers
told
the
government,
“well,
g.a.o.
can
come
at
anytime
it
wants
to
in
post
audit
and
we'll
even
make
a
refund
or
you
can
deduct.”
and
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
congress
directed
the
government
whenever
it
gets
a
carrier
bill
to
pay
it
promptly
then
if
--
then
if
you
want
to,
if
you
have
these
hundreds
of
thousands
of
vouchers,
bills
of
lading
to
examine
that
did
accumulate
during
the
war
then
the
g.a.o.
could
examine
those
--
those
vouchers
in
their
due
course
and
make
the
necessary
deduction
whenever
they
finally
reach
that
particular
stack
of
vouchers.
what
the
--
what
the
respondents
really
are
asking
for
here
by
insisting
that
we
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
within
two
years
by
saying
that
we
slipped
in
our
rights
by
not
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
within
two
years.
what
they're
really
trying
to
do
is
to
strip
the
government
completely
of
the
post
audit
protection,
congress
expressly
reserved
to
it
in
this
transportation
act
of
1940
as
consideration
for
this
prompt
payment
that
the
government
was
required
to
make
to
the
carriers.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
that
certainly
on
the
reasonableness
question
it
is.
but
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
congress
entrusted
the
g.a.o.
with
this
right
to
make
a
--
the
initial
deduction
that
that
certainly
leaks
the
view
from
a
reading
of
the
transportation
act
--
mr.
morton
hollander
and
--
and
the
--
the
government
notwithstanding
the
first
circuit
decision
that
colonel
wiener
relies
on,
the
--
the
government
is
never
before
had
to
establish
the
correctness
of
the
deduction
or
the
illegality
of
an
overpayment
before
these
deductions
are
effected.
that
was
true
before
the
transportation
act
in
252
u.s.,
justice
brandeis's
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
and
that
has
been
the
law
ever
since
right
through
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
he
pointed
in
a
--
a
case
very
closely
important
because
in
that
case
the
--
the
government
had
the
carrier
claimed
underpaid
it
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
government
in
1912
had
effected
the
deductions
against
the
carriers'
account
for
the
prior
12-year
period.
mr.
morton
hollander
i'd
like
very
much,
your
honor
if
i
may
to
address
myself
to
that
case.
but
i
was
just
about
to
say,
your
honor,
that
in
this
justice
--
in
justice
brandeis's
case,
the
government
--
it
was
the
government's
right
to
effect
these
deductions
in
1912,
was
attacked
and
justice
brandeis
bluntly
rejected
the
argument
that
the
government
has
to
come
in
first
into
court
or
before
a
committee
to
establish
the
legality
of
the
deductions
or
the
illegality
of
the
overpayment.
now,
morrisdale,
your
honor,
we
feel
is
--
is
not
at
all
even
in
point
in
this
case.
it
is
not
true
that
morrisdale
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
precluded
the
consideration
of
a
defense
asserted
by
this
shipper.
that,
your
honor,
is
not
true.
morrisdale
--
morrisdale
typifies
the
situation
where
a
plaintiff
or
a
claimant
having
an
affirmative
claim
has
an
opportunity
to
go
before
an
administrative
tribunal
within
a
fixed
period
of
time.
he
let's
that
fixed
period
of
time
go
by,
the
right
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
here
--
here,
your
honor,
the
people
who
let
the
fixed
period
of
time
go
by
originally
was
the
carrier,
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
i
--
i
certainly
realized
that
and
i
don't
want
to
attempt
to.
i
would
like
to
point
out
however
though
that
in
morrisdale,
the
situation
was
this.
the
--
the
shipper
in
that
case
filed
suit
in
the
district
court.
he
had
no
business
under
the
abilene
case.he
had
no
business
even
filing
that
suit
in
the
district
court
until
he
had
theretofore
obtained
an
i.c.c.
determination.
that
--
that
there
are
no
--
no
question
in
that
case.
he
had
no
right
to
go
into
court
in
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
until
he
had
obtained
the
i.c.c.
determination.
mr.
morton
hollander
he
had
little
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
the
court
--
the
court
--
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
court's
opinion
indicates
that
he
should've
been
wiser
before
their
decision.
the
--
the
shipper
in
that
case
left
a
period
of
time
go
by.
he
had
two
years
to
go
before
the
i.c.c.
the
shipper
left
that
period
of
time
go
by.
he
let's
the
two
year
period
of
time
go
by
and
then
he
comes
into
court
and
the
court
says,
“well,
what
you
should
have
gone
first
to
the
i.c.c.
and
you
let
that
period
of
time
go
by.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
come
into
court
now
after
the
two-year
period
of
time
in
which
you
could
have
gone
to
commission
has
gone
by.”
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
need.
there
was
no
what.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
let
me
tell
you
why,
your
honor.
in
the
western
pacific
case
for
example,
we
take
promptly
in
1948
and
in
1950
on
the
basis
of
the
lower
fifth-class
rates
and
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
is
concerned
--
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
is
concerned
that
it
was
paid
--
complete
at
that
time.
the
--
the
account
was
settled.
we
did
not
know
until
six
years
later
in
1954
that
when
suit
was
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
that
our
--
a
deduction
was
being
--
that
our
alleged
underpayment
was
being
attacked
by
the
carrier
and
we
would
have
been
thrown
out,
i
think,
it's
quite
properly
so
by
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
commission
if
we
had
gone
as
so
prematurely.
mr.
morton
hollander
in
bangor
and
aroostook,
your
honor,
in
seaboard
i
think
there
are
even
more
decisive
considerations
militating
against
the
possibility
of
the
government
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
within
two
years
after
1944
because
if
as
i
had
pointed
out
before
the
government
is
required
to
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
within
two
years
after
1944
that
means
that
that
statutory
reservation
of
post
audit
protection
is
completely
thrown
out
of
the
window
its
--
its
been
made
meaningless.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
your
honor.
in
the
western
--
in
the
bangor
and
aroostook
and
in
seaboard,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
when
the
deductions
were
effective.
all
we
know
is
that
prompt
payment
of
the
higher
amount
was
made
at
the
carriers'
request
in
1954,
a
deduction
was
made
sometime
in
the
next
10
year
period
of
time
and
at
the
end
of
that
10
year
period
of
time
in
1954
the
carrier
comes
into
court
and
files
this
suit.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
assume
i'm
not
using
the
time
of
that
case.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
thought
in
that
wherever
we
represent
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
thought
it
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
your
honor
there
--
first
of
all,
your
honor,
there
--
there
was
no
basis.
actually,
i
don't
know
where
in
the
government
we
--
we
--
mr.
morton
hollander
congress?
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
1940,
congress
said
at
the
carriers'
request
they
told
us,
congress
told
the
government,
“now
look,
you
get
those
bills,
pay
them.
pay
them
on
presentation.
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.”
all
right.
we
pay
those
bills
on
presentation.
they
go
over
to
g.a.o.
g.a.o.'s
machinery
has
to
start
to
function.
as
i
say
they
were
--
the
--
an
enormous
amount
of
bills
naturally
accumulating
during
the
world
war
period
when
there
were
so,
so
many
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shipment
of
military
supplies
over
to
domestic
carriers.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
--
i
think
--
they
all
--
i
--
i
can
only
answer,
your
honor,
in
this
way.
i
take
it
was
imperfectly
justifiable
for
the
i.c.c.
to
throw
us
out
and
to
tell
us,
“now
look,
you
have
the
statutory
right
reserved
to
you
in
the
transportation
act
in
1940
to
effect
the
deduction
of
any
amount
you
claim
is
unfair.”
now,
you
exercise
that
right
and
then
come
running
to
us
if
again
any
difficulty
but
if
you
are
able
to
settle
this
through
the
--
through
the
exercise
of
this
explicitly
reserved
right
well
than
--
than
of
course
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no
--
no,
your
honor.
in
all
three
cases
the
record
shows
that
the
railroad
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
did
demand
a
higher
rate.
mr.
morton
hollander
but
in
--
mr.
morton
hollander
but
we
paid
in
two
of
the
--
in
the
western
pacific
case
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
which
is
1948
-1950.
we
paid
initially
the
lower
rate.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
sure
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
be
delighted
to
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
furnish
a
supplemental
memorandum
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
to
show
the
(voice
overlap)
the
burden
under
which
g.a.o.
operated.
mr.
morton
hollander
may
i,
your
honor,
have
the
court's
indulgence
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
question?
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
wanted
to
distinguish
that
morrisdale
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
we're
content
to
rely
on
the
distinctions
in
the
brief.
mr.
morton
hollander
why
did
we,
your
honor?
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
the
--
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
by
the
time
1948
law,
these
shipments
took
place
in
the
korean
conflict
in
western
pacific.
the
--
the
shipments
in
the
other
two
cases
took
place
in
world
war
ii.
by
the
time
the
shipments
in
korean
conflict
took
place
in
1948
and
1950
the
administrative
agency,
the
war
department
of
the
army
had
already
been
alert
as
to
the
fact
that
the
carriers
were
charging
the
higher
first
class
rates
for
these
good
which
should
have
been
shipped
at
the
relatively
lower
fifth-class
rates.
mr.
morton
hollander
so,
the
problem
had
already
been
aired,
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
it
was
possible
--
it
was
possible
for
the
--
for
the
army
to
--
to
realize
what
the
true
situation
was
at
the
time
of
presentation
in
the
bills
and
the
record
shows
that
they
were
paid
promptly,
its
just
that
they
were
able
to
cash
the
error
in
the
bill
before
it
was
processed
administratively.
it
never
did
go
on
to
the
g.a.o.
where
any
post
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
that
they
told
us
only
--
mr.
morton
hollander
they
told
us
only,
your
honor,
to
pay
promptly
on
presentation
before
audit
by
the
general
accounting
office
and
that
--
that
mandate
was
complied
with
in
order
with
the
pay
system
and
there
hasn't
been
any
challenged
that
we
pay
promptly
prior
to
audit
by
the
g.a.o.
