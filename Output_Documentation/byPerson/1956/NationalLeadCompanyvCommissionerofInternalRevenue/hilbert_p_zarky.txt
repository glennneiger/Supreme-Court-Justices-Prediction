mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
the
court
please
--
i
--
i
think
that
at
least
enclosed
in
the
knob
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties
here,
must
be
a
determination
of
what
the
--
what
war
production
board
did
and
what
it
didn't
do
and
we
can't
reach
the
illegal
questions
until
we
first
find
out
what
the
facts
are.
national
lead
says
that
the
war
production
board
determined
that
these
facilities
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense,
period.
allen-bradley
says
that
we
admitted
that
these
facilities
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
i
think
neither
statement
can
be
accepted
as
correct.
the
best
place
to
find
this
is
in
the
record
and
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
let
me
read
from
pages
12
and
13
of
the
record
in
national
lead
and
they
say
this
consists
of
an
affidavit
given
by
the
chief
of
the
tax
amortization
branch
and
this
affidavit
has
been
used
in
all
these
cases
beginning
way
back
with
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
these
are
the
facts
which
all
the
taxpayers
have
accepted.
the
first
question
is
what
was
going
on
in
1943?
and
here's
what
the
affidavit
says.
we
are
entering
into
a
face
of
total
wealth
--
wealth
warfare
under
which
our
materials
and
manpower
went
short
supply.
it
would
seem
no
investment
of
capital
should
be
made
unless
it
was
fairly
necessary,
goes
down
to
say
would
increase
tax
rate,
necessity
certificates
had
become
attracted,
but
the
cost
of
government
was
a
real
sacrifice
with
--
to
the
government.
and
for
these
reasons,
the
matter
was
reexamined
and
submitted
for
policy
considerations.
now,
on
pages
14,
the
affidavit
said
and
this
is
after
the
policy
decision
had
been
laid
at
paragraph
16.
i--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
got
the
wrong
page.
on
page
15,
he
describes
the
war
production
policy
as
being
one
where
certificates
would
not
be
issued
unless
they
were
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
and
the
government's
financial
risk
was
being
safeguarded.
now,
what
the
war
production
board
then
did,
then
becomes
clear
when
we
take
this
memorandum
of
instructions
issued
for
its
personnel
and
the
standard
was
the
war
production
set
for
its
own
guidance
as
to
what
it
would
do
in
future
cases.
this
appears
on
page
46
of
the
record.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
page
15
was
to
describe
the
general
situation
that
confronted
the
war
production
board
when
it
made
a
policy
decision
saying,
“here
are
the
rules
we
will
apply
in
the
future.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
--
i
must
--
i
must
first
quarrel
a
little
bit
with
your
premise.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
let
me
make
it
clear.
let's
say
here,
the
act
that
comes
in
says,
“we
want
to
construct
factory,
extra
business
so
and
so.”
the
first
question
is
“do
we
need
a
factory
of
that
type?”
and
let
us
assume
the
war
production
board
said,
“yes.
this
kind
of
factory
is
essential.”
but
that's
not
all
that
the
war
production
had
to
do.
it
had
to
decide,
“do
we
want
to
construct
it
by
this
taxpayer
or
do
we
want
it
construct
by
the
government?”
if
it's
constructed
by
the
government,
it
may
be
at
a
considerable
saving.
if
it's
constructed
by
this
taxpayer,
it
may
affect
our
whole
economy.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
cost.
it's
the
questions
of
price
control,
in
which
the
tax
rate
played
a
heavy
role.
questions
of
the
sacrifice
of
materials.
is
this
particular
taxpayer
better
equipped
than
somebody
else
to
do
the
same
thing
or
the
same
kind
of
factory?
there
was
a
host
of
problems,
which
the
war
production
board
had
to
decide
in
its
own
mind
before
it
could
come
to
the
particular
decision
with
respect
to
a
particular
taxpayer
whether
a
particular
certificate
would
be
issued.
so
that
one
of
the
elements,
among
many
if
they
had
to
take
into
account
was
this
element
of
what
will
it
cost
the
government?
how
it
would
affect
the
revenue?
how
it
would
affect
price
control,
et
cetera.
and
all
i
want
to
do
and
make
at
this
point
is
to
make
clear
that
that
is
the
fact
in
which
they
did
take
into
account.
so,
they
didn't
say,
"this
is
absolutely
necessary
at
100%
of
cost
by
this
taxpayer."
they
made
a
relative
determination
saying
if
this
is
sorted
by
for
only
this
percentage
of
cost,
then
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
national
government
and
all
i'm
submitting
is
that
is
not
a
certification
that
this
is
absolutely,
irrevocably,
essential
to
the
government
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
are
with
respect
to
which
we
thought
and
with
respect
to
which
we'd
issued
the
certificate.
and
all
i
want
to
do
to
make
it
clear
at
this
point
is
that
these
were
the
very
factories
which
the
war
production
board
did
take
into
account.
in
other
words,
the
war
production
board,
had
it
been
told,
that
it
must
issue
either
100%
certificate
or
no
--
no
certificate
and
even
if
it
had
determined
that
it
did
need
this
particular
types
of
plants,
it
could
have
still
said
in
its
discretion,
"but
we
don't
want
it
and
built
by
this
taxpayer.
we
will
issue
no
certificate.
we
will
ask
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
to
build
us
a
plant.
ask
this
taxpayer
to
lease
it.
if
he
doesn't
want
to
do
it,
we'll
get
another
contractor
for
the
government,
if
not,
the
government
will
run
it
itself.
but
we
don't
have
to
jeopardize
the
revenue,
the
total
tax
collections
and
the
impact
upon
the
price
doctrine
by
saying
that
this
taxpayer
must
have
this.
it's
essential
to
the
war,
sure,
but
not
that
this
taxpayer
do
it
at
this
price
to
the
government."
and
that's
the
very
standard,
which
the
board
set
up.
it
said,
‘we
will
not
issue
a
certificate
for
100%
in
the
future
if
these
plants
had
postwar
utility.
we
will
only
issue
them
if
they
don't
have
any."
that
means
the
taxpayer
will
utilize
the
full
value
of
the
facility
in
creating
income
during
the
emergency
and
after
that,
he'll
have
nothing
left
of
value.
he
should
deduct
100%
of
the
cost
during
the
time
he's
earning
the
income.”
but
he
was
still
going
to
have
--
they
have
here
perhaps
a
machine
tool,
will
last
20
years.
the
war
may
last
only
another
two
years.why
should
the
government
subsidize
this
taxpayer
to
have
machine
tools
that
he'll
--
could
barely
use
another
18
years
with
the
cost
already
written
off
when
the
government
could
buy
the
same
machine
tool,
make
them
available,
get
the
same
production
for
the
war
and
still
have
the
tools
for
itself
after
the
war.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right,
that
they
might
have
done
something
else
justice
harlan.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
may
have
come
running
to
congress
and
said,
“this
is
an
impossible
situation."
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we
can't
answer
these
delicate
questions
yes
or
no,
black
or
white.
the
courts
have
told
us
we
have
no
authority.
we
must
have
that
authority.
and
congress
i'm
sure,
if
these
are
possible,
would
have
given
them
the
authority.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
certainly,
the
tax
court
can't
unscramble
it
and
say,
“well,
had
they
known
they
had
no
power
and
had
all
these
things,
they
still
would
have
given
them
100%
certificate.
neither
the
tax
court
nor
the
court
of
claims
nor
this
court
can
say
what
the
administrators
would
just
think
why
discretion
entrusted
to
them.
how
they
would
have
answer
that
question
had
it
been
opposed
in
the
context
that
the
taxpayers
would
oppose
this
case.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
first
challenge
as
i
recall
took
place
in
1946
or
1947,
when
the
graphite
company
came
into
the
district
court
herein
said,
"mandamus,
the
war
production
board
to
issue
a
certificate."
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
they
had
been
issuing
them
per
part
and
taxpayers
did
bargain.
for
example,
allen-bradley
got
a
certificate
for
25%
and
went
back
and
said,
“we
won't
construct
the
plant
under
these
circumstances.
we
won't
proceed.”
and
the
government
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
it
was
increased
to
80%
and
then
they
did
go
ahead.
the
first
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
complaint
was
contemporaneously
back
in
the
fall
of
1943
or
the
winter
of
1943.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
didn't
complain
in
court.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
and
they
didn't
complain
when
they
got
the
80%
certificate.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
apparently
were
satisfied
with
it.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
1943.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
--
i
think
they
filed
a
refund
claim
in
1953
or
1954.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
can't
recall
the
exact
date.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
may
i
--
may
i
continue
to
--
to
answer
completely
justice
black
so
that
that
mandamus
case
judge
pine
said,
“no,
this
statute
"
and
we
read
the
decision
there
differently.
the
taxpayer,
"this
statute
is
broad
enough
to
permit
the
administrators
to
issue
a
certificate
for
35
or
45
or
whatever
percentage
they
find
is
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
and
i
cannot
mandamus
them
to
issue
you
100%
certificate
and
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
1949.
then
to
go
further
in
1950
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
on
the
merits
as
to
what
the
statute
meant,
but
as
i
say,
it
hadn't
been
worst
for
the
government
had
judge
pine
said,
“no,
i
can't
read
the
statute
as
the
government
does.
i'm
sure
judge
pine
will
have
or
at
least
he
would
have
been
correct
on
appeal
if
he
hadn't
would
not
have
mandamus
the
issuance
of
100%
certificate."
he
would
have
said,
"i'm
without
power
to
exercise
that
discretion.
i
must
remand
to
the
war
production
board.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
until
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
dismissed.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
correct.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
as
the
why
taxpayers
didn't
litigate
this.
they
knew
that
the
decision
was
foreclosed.
the
court
of
appeals
here,
the
only
court
that
could
have
ruled
on
it
had
dealt
with
the
merits
and
said,
“no,
the
government's
right.
the
war
production
board
properly
acts
when
it
does
this.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
think
judge
pine
said
that
on
mandamus,
he
would
construe
the
statute
as
broadly
as
he
ought
to
because
unless
he
took
a
strict
construction,
he
ought
not
to
mandamus
to
the
administrative
official.
but
let
us
pretend
as
i
said
that
judge
pine
had
said
giving
the
statute
the
broader
scrutiny
if
congress
has
denied
the
officials
have
power
to
do
this.
he
wouldn't
have
issued
100%
certificate.
i'm
sure
he
would
have
anticipated
this
court's
decisions
in
holly
hill
and
idaho
power
and
said,
“i
must
remand
it.
there's
a
residual
area
of
discretion
left
for
the
board.
they
must
exercise
it,
not
us,
not
i.”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
we're
--
we
--
we
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
sir.
we
are
commanded
and
we
--
to
--
by
regulations
that
the
certificate
is
conclusive
evidence
of
what
it
certified
and
we
recognize
that
35%
of
the
cost
of
this
or
80%
or
85,
whatever
these
various
certificates
read
is
subject
to
amortization.
but
your
honor
has
really
put
your
finger
on
one
of
the
weak
points
of
the
taxpayer's
case
because
if
you
take
their
contention
and
you
decide
them
logically,
they're
coming
in,
they
say,
“the
war
production
board
issued
us
a
certificate,
but
they
acted
illegally.”
and
the
tax
court
could
well
have
said,
“well,
if
it's
illegal
you
have
no
certificate.
now
where
are
you
mr.
taxpayer?”
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
sir.
we
concede
that
--
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
deduction
based
upon
the
percentage,
which
the
war
production
board
did
certify.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
or
zero.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
your
honor
raises
a
--
a
difficult
problem
of
this
in
the
past
with
these
cases.
we
have
and
the
court
below
conceded
that
the
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
the
deduction
which
they
did
take
in
their
returns
based
on
the
percentages
which
the
war
production
board
had
certified.but
if
this
court
should
say
that
the
war
production
board
had
no
authority
to
do
this.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
you
will
throw
--
you
will
throw
into
confusion
literally
millions
of
certificates
involving
billions
of
dollars
of
taxpayer's
who
may
still
have
open
years
because
the
commissioner
made
them
say
you
have
no
certificate.
you're
entitled
to
no
amortization
and
you
get
no
tax
deduction
on
this
basis.
now,
you
go
get
yourself
a
certificate.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
it
was,
yes.
it
wasn't
required.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
say
on
this
case,
with
our
concessions
as
to
their
being
entitled
to
the
amount
they
actually
certified,
that
neither
the
tax
court
nor
the
court
of
claims
could
undertake
to
exercise
that
discretion,
which
the
war
production
would
have
had
on
very
proper
legal
standard
of
100%
or
no
certificate
because
they
certainly
have
not
said
you're
entitled
to
100%
and
we
don't
know
what
the
war
production
would
have
said
had
it
been
told
100%
or
denied.
they
might
well
have
denied
these
certificates.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
your
honor,
because
this
construction
--
and
i
don't
ban
these
words
as
i
said
before,
to
mr.
justice
harlan
but
let
--
let
me
choose
a
different
word
to
say
to
make
myself
clear.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
let
--
let
me
change
the
words
or
just
make
myself
clear
because
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
slice
words
to
find
them,
but
let
us
pick
factory
s.
and
let
me
use
the
word
“essential
to
the
war
effort”
to
indicate
a
plant,
which
we
had
had
or
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
that's
--
that's
not
part
of
the
finding,
but
that
was
part
of
--
of
what
judgment
they
had
to
have
under
the
executive
order
that
these
facilities
had
to
be
necessary
for
the
war
effort.
that's
the
first
point.
they
can't
be
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
until
they're
necessary
in
the
war
effort.
now,
the
next
question
is
when
this
taxpayer
applies
for
a
certificate,
is
it
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
that
these
facilities
which
are
essential
to
the
war
be
constructed
by
this
taxpayer
at
this
price.
they
could
have
said
we
do
need
this
factory.
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
war
effort
essential
to
the
war
effort.
the
reconstruction
finance
plant
or
the
government
itself
direct
can
purchase
this
plant,
it
can
contract
for
its
acquisition,
it
can
--
it
can
contain
this
plant
with
government
ownership.
now,
we
have
a
plant,
which
is
essential
for
the
war
effort,
but
if
the
war
plant
defense
corporation
or
if
the
government
or
other
financing
had
build
this
plant,
it
was
obvious
they
own
the
plant
when
the
war
was
over
with
and
as
the
plant
was
let's
say
was
worth
a
million
dollars
and
constructed
and
then
three
quarters
a
million
beyond
the
end
of
the
war,
the
government
will
have
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
they
could
realize
that.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
let's
go
--
let's
go
back
and
pose
us
a
situation
so
it
was
but
really
test
it.
let
us
say
that
immediately
upon
being
issued
a
certificate,
the
taxpayer
protested
because
i
want
100%.
they
say
no,
goes
into
district
court
and
ask
where
i
would
think
to
be
proper
in
the
district
court,
are
the
(1)
one
of
the
statute
doesn't
allow
this
and
(2)
since
it
doesn't
allow
it,
please
remand
to
the
war
production
board
and
let's
pretend
the
district
court
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
isn't
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
but
there's
no
question
if
they
had
power
to
decide
100%
or
nothing.
the
question
is
do
they
have
the
power
to
decide
35%?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
i
--
i
think
not.
let's
--
let's
go
back
to
the
district
court,
that
litigation
i'm
describing
and
the
district
court
remanded
to
the
war
production
board
said,
”you
must
issue
100%
certificate
or
no
certificate.
i
won't
tell
you
how
to
exercise
your
judgment,
but
please
exercise
it.”
and
then
they
would
sit
down
and
they
would
study
this
application.
they
would
weigh
all
the
various
factors
that
had
to
be
weighed.
was
it
worthwhile
to
the
government
to
issue
a
certificate
for
100%
or
would
it
be
really
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
and
that
was
what
their
ultimate
guiding
principle
to
have
the
government
build
it
and
say
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
a
--
at
least
he's
helpless
in
this
tax
proceeding
because
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
correct.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
more
than
that,
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
let's
assume
the
agency
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no.
oh,
no
justice
frankfurter.
i'd
go
further
than
that.
i
say
the
change
in
situation
has
resulted
from
this
lapse
of
twelve
years
makes
those
different
than
holly
hill.
if
contemporaneously
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
whether
it
was
the
agency
in
existence
or
--
or
not.
they
had
--
if
contemporaneously
they
had
gone
to
the
agency,
these
possibilities
i
mentioned
were
existing
at
that
time.
the
government
could
have
built
it.
the
government
could
have
gone
to
congress.but
today,
that's
no
longer
possible.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
alternative
of
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
--
i
quoted
the
--
the
part
of
the
instruction
for
example
that
summarized
that.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
don't
quote
the
basic
statutory
authority
for
constructing
government
plants.
no,
we
--
we
don't
have
that.
but
that
existed
under
the
defense
production
act,
i
believe.
there
are
many
enactments
giving
the
government
power
to
use
various
facilities
for
government
financing.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
that
wasn't
in
the
revenue
act
but
all
that
was
actually
explained
at
the
time
of
the
amortization
provisions
were
put
before
congress
when
secretary
stimson
--
others
came
to
testify.
they
described
the
various
ways
the
government
hopes
in
an
overall
picture
from
the
government
--
from
the
private
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
that
were
this
case,
mandamus
(inaudible)
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
think
justice
black
that
the
answer
i'll
give
to
you
is
about
the
same
i
was
going
to
give
to
justice
frankfurter's
as
to
why
holly
hill,
in
that
aspect
of
holly
hill
doesn't
apply
here.
and
that
is
this.
that
the
situation
has
changed
with
the
passage
of
time,
the
acceptance
of
the
certificate
and
the
government
stating
that
the
taxpayer
did
what
it
did
consciously.
in
other
words,
justice
frankfurter
had
given
a
direct
attack
at
that
point
--
point.
had
he
asked
judge
pine
to
remand
the
matters
to
war
production
board
for
an
exercise
of
its
discretion?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
that's
correct.
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
i
said,
if
that
were
this
case,
mandamus
would
lie
but
it's
not
this
case.
they
did
not
determine
that
these
facilities
were
100%
necessary.
they
determined
only
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
then,
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
him
fully.
if
there
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
or
the
government
could
still
certify
all
because
the
--
the
powers
of
war
production
board
residually
lie
in
the
secretary
of
commerce.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
they
do
today.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
understand,
sir
and
that's
why
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
would
like
to
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
i
would
--
that
i
would
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
holly
hill,
when
the
matter
was
remanded
to
the
administrator
and
he
presumably
made
a
correct
definition
of
the
exemption
within
the
proper
legal
standard,
everybody
stood
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
stood
had
he
done
so
originally
and
no
one
was
harmed.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
status
quo
was
not
altered
by
the
passage
of
time.now,
what
i
suggest
is
that
the
status
quo
her
has
very
much
altered
by
the
passage
of
time.
in
other
words
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
at
that
time
because
the
choice
when
i
make
myself
clear.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
only
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
he
knew
precisely
the
moment
he
got
his
certificate
that
his
tax
deduction
was
going
to
be
limited.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
but
whether
it
was
a
mistake
of
law,
a
mistake
of
fact
or
what
have
you.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
--
i
do
in
this
respect
justice
frankfurter
because
if
the
taxpayer
who's
let
the
time
left
by
not
being
aware
of
his
legal
rights.
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
this.
had
time
not
intervened,
the
government
contemporaneously
could
have
built
a
substitute
plan
of
its
own
and
the
government
could
have
had
the
value
or
the
full
for
utility.
obviously
that
is
no
longer
possible.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
it
can't
do
anything
today.
the
other
thing
is
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
it
would
be
very
difficult
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
(inaudible)
importance
likewise
that
the
regulations
at
that
time
said
that,
“no
certificate
of
necessity
will
be
issued
unless
prior
to
the
construction
of
the
facility
an
application
has
denied.”
this
was
precisely
reversed.
the
facilities
have
already
been
constructed.
and
the
third
important
thought
i'd
like
to
leave
is,
it's
no
longer
possible
to
go
to
congress
for
curative
legislation.
at
that
time
the
war
production
board
could
have
gone
to
congress
and
said
the
courts
have
told
us
to
make
yes
or
no
answers.
we
find
that
we
cannot
satisfy
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
by
yes
or
no
answers.
kindly
give
us
the
authority
to
issue
35%.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
do
you
have
a
question
justice
harlan?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
thank
you.
