how
long
was
it
after
the
act
was
passed
on
to
any
contractor
challenge
the
power
of
the
government
or
the
board
to
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
during
that
time,
has
the
board
been
issuing
this
certificates
per
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
was
--
what
was
it
increased
to
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
when
was
that
first
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
a
part
of
the
act
which
gives
the
government
--
gave
the
government
that
alternative?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
quoted
the
part
of
the
act
which
gave
the
government
that
alternative?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doing
it
itself
or
give
it
--
letting
the
companies
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
as
i
recall
the
history
of
the
act
was
that
companies
were
slow
about
building
because
they
would
not
--
had
not
been
given
the
right
to
tax
exemption
or
immunity.
that
controversy
ran
sometime,
was
finally
settled
as
i
recall
it
by
a
statute,
which
provided
that
the
government
could
wrap
tax
immunity,
which
you
have
cited
--
have
--
have
quoted
and
at
the
same
time
left
the
government
the
power
on
--
was
it
designed
to
do
so.
it
didn't
make
the
right
kind
of
contracts
for
the
government
to
build
it
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
what's
been
asked
of
you
about
the
--
what
you
--
what
would
result
from
a
holding.
statement
when
possible
--
holding
is
that
the
government
here
has
foreclosed
them
from
raising
that
question
because
it
does
not
give
the
right
--
yet
they
did
not
have
the
right
by
mandamus
to
get
a
remedy
to
--
to
get
the
situation
remedy.
if
it'd
be
true
that
the
board
may
find
that
this
was
necessary
and
essential
under
the
act,
that
was
enough
to
make
it
legally
imperative
that
a
--
a
certificate
for
100%
be
given.
why
isn't
that
the
classical
kind
of
case
in
which
mandamus
lies
to
perform
a
plain
legal
union
that
only
assumption
that
the
government's
made
their
finding,
which
--
what
one
does
and
the
commission
board
has
nothing
left
to
do,
but
perform
a
plain
legal
duty,
giving
them
100%
immunity
or
whatever
--
whatever
you
call
it.
why
isn't
that
the
kind
of
case
that's
always
been
held
in
every
kind
of
court
to
justify
the
issues
for
mandamus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
now,
if
that's
true
and
we
are
to
decide
it
on
that
basis,
what
do
you
say
if
that's
the
fact,
that
they
stood
by
and
did
not
exercise
that
right
and
took
a
claim,
built
a
plan
under
a
situation
where
it
looked
like
they
were
--
the
government
was
making
its
contracts
on
one
basis
and
then
long
after
the
time
had
passed
when
the
government
did
protect
itself,
they
come
in
and
challenge
the
holding.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
their
right?
is
the
question
of
the
right
to
mandamus
involved
in
that
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they
dare
to
ask
him
to
remand
it
if
the
premise
on
which
the
question
was
asked
you
is
correct.
it
was
a
plain
legal
duty
because
of
what
had
been
done
already
in
the
past
to
give
them
the
100%
exemption
instead
of
the
35%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
they,
having
certified
a
part
and
not
certified
either
on
the
--
the
companies
have
held
those
certificates
through
the
years
until
the
time
when
the
government
cannot
certify
all
or
nothing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
status
quo
was
not
altered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
it
do
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
has
required
to
hold
it
and
present
it
doesn't
it?
