justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
forget
the
court
of
appeals
that's
on
the
stage,
will
you?
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
please.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
because
it's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
my
old
circuit
because
i
think
that's
the
--
that's
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
bill
is
concerned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
none
of
that
belies
the
fact
that
they
had
certified
and
continued
to
certify
the
physical
facilities
as
such
to
be
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
with
the
war.
all
they're
saying
here
is
that
we'd
like
to
save
the
government
a
little
money
and
therefore
we're
going
to
add
this
additional
factor
to
our
certifications
and
the
question
at
issue
is
whether
they
had
the
power
under
the
statute
to
add
that
additional
factor,
isn't
that
the
whole
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
asking
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
you're
really
saying
if
i
understand
your
argument
is
that
the
government
at
this
stage
was
interested
in
the
financial,
the
economics
of
this
emergency
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they
thought
they
could
go
ahead
and
require
the
war
production
board
so
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
require
the
feasible
facility
and
at
the
same
time
fulfill
the
economic
aspect
by
issuing
35%
certificate
or
50%
certificate.
and
are
--
what
you're
saying
it
seems
to
me
is
that
although
they
did
--
if
they
had
known
that
they
were
without
power
to
do
that,
they
might
have
taken
a
new
look
at
the
situation
of
an
issue
ab
initio
and
then
said,
“no,
we
won't
have
this
physical
plant
built
at
all.”
but
it
doesn't
belie
the
fact
that
they
did
what
they
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
they
might
have
but
they
didn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
still,
having
done
what
they
did
and
if
they
actually
were
without
power,
you
can't
unscramble
the
facts
and
say
that
they
might
have
been
something
different
had
they
known
that
they
didn't
have
the
power.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
ask
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
