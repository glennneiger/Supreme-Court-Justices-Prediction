and
does
that
--
does
that
mean
that
if
this
certificate
isn't
good
for
30
--
it
isn't
good
for
100%,
it
isn't
good
for
the
35%
and
they
must
go
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
raise
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
hasn't
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
--
if
they
--
if
they
say
--
assume
that
we
should
say
here
that
the
war
--
the
war
production
board
only
has
a
power
to
issue
100%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wonder
if
that
has
to
follow
if
the
determinant
is
whether
they
found
that
this
particular
construction
was
in
the
national
interest
and
upon
such
a
finding,
they're
automatically
followed
100%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
at
proceeding
now
on
the
premise
that
we
will
define
that
the
only
authority
that
the
war
production
board
had
was
to
issue
100%
certificate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
is
a
consequence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
a
finding
that
the
facility
was
necessary
in
the
national
defense
and
at
each
of
these
instances
and
indeed
wherever
any
certificate
was
issued,
there
was
a
finding
that
the
facility
was
needed
in
the
national
defense,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
finding
added?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
this
is
a
question
of
power
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
to
you
earlier,
they
may
have
had
those
alternatives,
but
once
having
committed
themselves
to
the
alternative
of
having
it
built
by
this
taxpayer,
if
--
as
a
consequence
automatically
they'll
follow
the
100%.
now
they
may
have
thought
they
could
make
it
35%
or
25%
or
something
else.
what
can
the
government
do
about
it?
that's
a
matter
of
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
my
--
my
difficulty
with
that
argument,
mr.
zarky,
is
if
it's
a
matter
of
power,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
or
not
someone
did
or
did
not
go
under
the
district
court
to
test
whether
they
could
do
something
as
to
the
100%?
if
they
had
power
upon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
finding
of
in
the
interest
to
national
defense,
100%
or
nothing,
that's
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
i
said,
if
the
only
power
was
to
decide
100%
or
nothing
and
they
committed
to
this
taxpayer,
that's
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
listen,
aren't
--
aren't
you
suggesting
that
if
all
i'd
to
be
done
the
first
instance,
the
government
was
privileged
to
make
a
mistake
as
to
the
scope
of
its
power.
but
if
it
did,
the
taxpayer's
helpless
if
he
didn't
protest
at
the
time.
