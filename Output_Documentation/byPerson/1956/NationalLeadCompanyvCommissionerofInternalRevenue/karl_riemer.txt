mr.
karl
riemer
riemer.
mr.
karl
riemer
okay.
your
honor,
there
is
no
--
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
material
factual
difference
between
the
--
allen-bradley
case
on
this.the
only
material
difference
between
the
two
cases
that
i
can
see
is
that
my
brother
peters
won
and
i
lost
below.
i'd
like
to
review
this
amortization
program
for
a
moment
that
came
in,
in
1940,
when
we
were
faced
with
an
emergency
and
when
american
business
and
industry
still
had
a
depression
psychology.
mr.
peters
said
that
there
was
much
responsible
opinion
to
the
effect
that
our
physical
plant
was
overbuilt
at
that
time.
american
business
and
industries
were
afraid
of
a
post-war
depression.
that's
why
it
did
not
want
to
invest
its
capital
in
new
productive
facilities,
which
it
might
not
be
able
to
make
economic
use
of
after
the
war.
in
those
circumstances,
congress
made
a
compact
with
business
and
industry
that
if
they
would
build
these
facilities,
that
this
cost
could
be
amortized
to
give
such
profits
as
could
be
earned
during
the
emergency
period.
now,
there
had
to
be
a
cutoff
date.
congress
legislated
in
the
summer
of
1940.
first,
it
said
that
no
facility
completed
after
july
10
could
be
treated
--
could
be
treated
as
an
emergency
facility.
later,
it
pushed
the
date
back,
but
it
made
this
provision
that
to
the
extent
that
a
facility
has
been
completed
after
the
critical
day,
it
could
be
certified
that
amortization
could
apply
to
the
cost
attributable
to
construction
after
the
critical
date.
that
was
one
problem
that
the
percentage
certificates
in
the
early
days
of
the
program
saw.
the
second
problem
that
those
percentage
certificates
in
the
early
days
saw
was
this.as
undersecretary
patterson
said
in
the
report,
which
is
in
the
record.
in
the
early
days,
there
was
difficulty
in
determining
especially
where
a
facility
had
been
begun
before
the
blitzkrieg
broke
loose,
whether
it
was
really
designed
for
defense
or
for
--
for
facility
--
for
civilian
purposes.
so
in
those
early
days,
if
the
certifying
agencies
decided
that
30%
of
the
facility
was
for
defense
and
70%
was
for
civilian
use,
they
issued
a
certificate
of
30%
of
cost
up
to
30%
of
cost.
now,
taxpayers
who
got
those
certificates
have
no
complaints
because
limiting
amortization
to
30%
of
cost
of
a
facility
that
is
only
30%
necessary
is
only
a
practical
and
convenient
means
of
reflecting
the
determination
of
necessity
made
by
the
certifying
agency.
now,
that
leads
me
to
what
the
certifying
agencies
did
in
these
cases.
first,
i
think
the
record
can
leave
no
doubt
that
they
found
as
to
each
of
these
facilities
that
they
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
defense,
period.
those
are
the
statutory
words.
mr.
karl
riemer
well,
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
defense,
mr.
justice
reed.
period.
i
don't
think
you
can
express
that
in
terms
of
percentage.
you
can
say
that
a
facility
is
half
necessary,
that
is
half
of
it
is
necessary,
but
that's
something
else.
they
found
first
that
these
facilities
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
and
that's
what
congress
told
them
to
find.
they
found
also,
as
to
the
facilities
which
are
involved
in
these
cases
before
you
that
it
was
to
the
advantage
of
the
government
that
the
facilities
be
privately
financed.
now,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
war
production
board
undertook
to
determine
that,
to
make
a
decision
as
to
that.but
there's
not
a
word
in
the
statute
which
imposes
a
duty
upon
them
to
make
that
determination.
they
made
it
here.
they
also
found
in
respect
of
each
of
the
facilities
that's
before
this
court
that
the
facility
had
postwar
utility.
now,
assuming
that
that's
something
that's
easy
to
decide
or
can
be
decided
at
all
in
the
midst
of
a
war.
assuming
that,
there's
nevertheless,
not
a
word
in
the
statute
that
lays
that
function
of
making
a
decision
on
that
point
to
the
certifying
agencies.
fourth,
the
certifying
agencies
found
in
respect
of
the
facilities
that
are
here
involved
that
the
difference
between
normal
peacetime
cost
of
these
facilities
and
their
cost
during
the
war
was
x
percent,
35
in
this
case,
80
in
another
and
so
on.
that
is
the
amount
that
the
war
production
board
tried
to
limit
our
amortization
to
and
the
record
shows
that.
it
shows
that
the
certificates
were
limited
as
to
percentage
of
cost
only
because
they
were
determined
to
have
postwar
utility
and
that
they
had
excess
war
cost.
there
was
no
qualification
of
the
necessity,
whatever.
now,
i'd
like
to
pass
to
another
point
that
is
obviously
of
interest
to
the
court.
why
are
we
here
in
1956?
in
the
first
place,
the
war
production
board
and
its
predecessor
agencies
had
no
protest
system.
as
a
practical
matter,
all
of
us
who
were
here
during
the
war
know
this.
you
couldn't
take
up
your
time
protesting.
it
was
futile
anyway.
second,
congress
set
up
no
provision
for
review
of
determinations
of
necessity.
much
less
did
it
set
up
a
provision
for
review
of
determinations
of
excess
war
cost
and
postwar
utility.
there
was
no
review
available
within
the
administrative
agency.
second,
in
1947,
the
united
states
graphite
company
went
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
they
petitioned
for
mandamus
to
the
secretary
of
commerce,
the
--
the
successor
to
the
wpb
to
correct
a
certificate.
now,
that
wasn't
very
long
delay.
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
decided
no
mandamus.
mandamus
will
not
lie
to
correct
administrative
discretion.
we
think
that's
good
law.
the
government
thinks
that's
good
law.
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
mandamus
would
lie
if
there
was
an
error.
that's
where
we
quarrel
with
that
decision.
the
taxpayer,
u.s.
graphite,
appealed
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
lost
by
a
divided
court.
it
sought
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
that
was
denied.
that
occurred
in
1949.
now,
since
the
courts
over
the
country
generally
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
mandamus
against
a
federal
administrative
agency,
since
you
can
only
bring
such
a
case
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
taxpayers
generally
know
it
was
futile
to
seek
mandamus
to
correct
these
errors
in
1949
and
from
thereon.
the
same
taxpayer,
then
called
the
wickes
corporation
went
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
was
convinced
that
even
if
mandamus
didn't
lie
to
correct
an
error
and
we
say
that's
right
because
there
might
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
what
the
administrator
did
in
the
first
place.
nevertheless,
what
the
administrative
did
was
wrong
and
therefore,
the
court
of
claims
granted
relief
to
the
wickes
corporation.
at
that
point,
the
question
came
up,
should
the
government
ask
this
court
to
review?
the
government
did
not
ask
this
court
to
review.
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
taxpayers
generally
could
have
assumed
that
the
tax
question
had
been
decided.
the
next
defense
of
interest
is
that
the
national
lead
company
case,
which
incidentally
are
involved
in
many
other
issues
was
scheduled
for
trial
in
the
tax
court.
just
before
the
trial,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
announced
that
he
would
not
follow
the
wickes
decision.
so
as
far
as
national
lead
is
concerned,
we
had
to
go
to
the
tax
court
with
it
or
let
it
drop
forever
because
our
hearing
would
soon
be
over
and
we
would
have
no
way
to
contest
to
change
the
tax
liability
for
the
years
here
involved.
now,
mr.
zarky
has
read
to
you
the
statute.
perhaps
it
is
not
the
best
legislative
draftsmanship,
but
i
don't
have
too
much
trouble
with
it.
there
shall
be
included
only
so
much
of
the
amount
otherwise,
constituting
such
adjusted
basis
as
is
properly
attributable
to
such
construction
as
--
as
either
the
secretary
or
the
--
or
--
or
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
certified,
as
is
attributable
to
such
construction
as
has
been
certified.
mr.
zarky
wants
you
to
read
that
as
though
that
properly
attributable
clause
were
not
in
there
as
though
the
statute
said
there
shall
be
included
only
such
--
so
much
of
the
amount
as
either
the
secretary
of
war
or
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
certified.
i
say
that
is
a
misreading
of
the
statute.
i
come
also
to
this
question
of
partial
certification.
of
course,
the
certifying
agencies
had
power
to
certify
parts
of
facilities
and
they
did
certify
parts
of
facilities.
and
that
power
comes
not
from
the
section,
which
we
are
discussing,
subsection
f(1),
but
from
the
very
definition
of
an
emergency
facility.
that
term
according
to
the
statute
means
any
facility,
land,
building,
machinery,
equipment
or
part
of
their
armory,
which
either
secretary
has
certified.
now,
i
can't
think
of
any
problem
of
partial
certification
of
any
facility,
which
is
only
partly
physically
necessary
to
the
national
defense,
which
couldn't
be
certified
under
that
provision.
50%
of
a
factory,
that's
all
right.
one
production
line
instead
of
another,
that's
all
right.
part
of
a
facility
could
be
certified,
but
this
authority
to
certify
a
part
does
not
come
from
the
so
called
"only
so
much
clause"
of
subsection
f(1).
the
commissioner
dismissed
it,
almost
through
the
wave
of
a
hand
the
immensely
difficult
problem
of
postwar
use.
we
had
an
amortization
law
under
--
in
world
war
i.
that
is
three
months
after
the
war
had
ended,
congress
passed
a
provision
providing
or
allowing
reasonable
deductions
for
the
amortization
of
facilities
paid
for
by
the
taxpayer
and
used
in
war
production.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
determined
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
allow
as
such
a
deduction,
the
difference
between
cost
and
value
in
use
after
the
war.
now,
that's
a
logical
enough
concept,
but
it
created
endless
practical
difficulty.
it
was
one
of
the
principal
subjects,
which
interested
the
famous
customs
committee
investigating
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue.
it
was
a
difficult
problem
and
congress
knew
it
was.
congress
knew
in
1940
that
it
was.
it
meant
to
avoid
those
difficulties
and
it
did
avoid
those
difficulties
by
leaving
the
problems
of
postwar
use
and
excess
war
cost
out
of
the
statute.
the
commissioner
says
the
problems
of
the
world
war
i
law
were
solved
by
fixing
the
period,
the
five-year
period
or
less.
the
one
thing
that
was
sure
about
the
world
war
i
law
was
the
period
because
the
war
was
already
over
when
congress
acted.
now,
whether
the
war
production
board
was
wise
or
unwise
in
injecting
into
this
amortization
scheme,
these
problems
of
postwar
utility
and
excess
war
cost,
these
are
factors
requiring
a
degree
of
clairvoyance.
that's
not
the
issue
here
whether
they
were
wise
or
unwise
by
standards
that
we
might
apply
today.
the
issue
here
is
the
--
the
issue
of
power
of
an
administrative
agency.
that
experience
has
shown
that
a
statute
should
have
been
more
comprehensive
is
no
wants
for
extending
it.
i
come
to
the
principle
which
in
the
last
analysis,
the
supposed
principle,
which
in
the
last
analysis
must
give
the
commissioner
his
chief
support.
he
cannot
find
a
word
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
congress
was
concerned
with
cost
or
with
postwar
utility
or
with
excess
war
cost.
the
precise
language
of
the
statute
and
the
illuminating
legislative
history
belie
that
possibility.
they
make
the
commissioner's
position
untenable.
so,
he
espouses
what
we
regard
as
a
novel
and
dangerous
doctrine.
he
said
that
the
power
of
an
administrative
agency
is
to
be
measured
not
by
what
congress
granted
it
but
by
what
congress
didn't
say
it
could
do
or
didn't
say
it
couldn't
do.
mr.
karl
riemer
this
is
no
exaggeration.
in
the
allen-bradley
brief,
the
commissioner
says,
“in
dealing
with
these
difficult
problems,
congress
did
not
say
these
agencies
should
be
precluded
from
determining
that
only
part
of
the
cost
of
facilities
is
necessary.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
regulation.
mr.
karl
riemer
very
well,
sir.
mr.
karl
riemer
i
will
try
to
come
back
to
it.
mr.
karl
riemer
i
want
to
--
mr.
karl
riemer
very
well,
sir.
i
will
--
i
had
it
in
mind.
i
want
to
say
this
about
the
regulation.
there
has
never
been
--
i
should
say
--
there
never
was
a
regulation
of
the
war
department,
of
the
navy
department
or
of
the
wpb
which
referred
by
so
much
as
one
word
to
the
matter
of
excess
war
cost,
postwar
utility
which
are
the
only
reasons
why
there
was
a
limitation
on
these
certificates.
there
was
no
published
regulation.
it
was
internal
policy.
i
don't
think
the
world
whether
it
knew
or
not
was
bound
by
that
internal
policy.
that
most
the
regulations
did
was
say
in
the
latter
day
that
no
certificate
would
be
granted
unless
it
was
found
to
the
advantage
of
the
government
to
have
them
privately
commence.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
to
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
the
court
below,
with
due
respect,
misinterpreted
the
facts.
perhaps,
that
was
my
fault.
i
don't
think
the
court
understood
that
there
was
in
fact
in
this
record
and
if
not
so
clear
in
the
record
in
the
clear
understanding
of
the
parties,
the
determination
by
the
wpb
that
these
facilities
were
necessary,
period.
and
that
the
limitation
of
--
was
bottomed
only
on
the
determinations
as
to
excess
war
cost
and
postwar
utility.
i
have
no
doubt,
but
that
court
was
impressed
and
i
am
sometimes
ashamed
of
the
time
it
takes
to
dispose
of
tax
controversy.
but
that
question
wasn't
raised
until
the
commissioner
filed
his
brief
in
the
second
circuit.
it
was
--
the
question
wasn't,
in
brief,
for
the
taxpayer.
we
have
no
opportunity.
we
tried
hard.
we
made
a
motion
for
rehearing.
we
tried
hard
to
explain
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
undue
delay
here.
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
protest
to
the
wpb
that
there
was
no
system
of
review
or
appeal
of
wpb
decisions,
that
mandamus
had
been
sought
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
the
district
of
columbia's
court
said,
“mandamus
will
not
lie
to
control
administrative
discretion,
which
we
think
is
right.
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
thought
that
there
was
any
real
doubt
that
there
was
a
finding
that
these
facilities
were
necessary,
just
as
necessary
as
any
aluminum
plant
built
early
in
the
war,
there
can't
be
any
doubt
of
it
involved
bearing
factory.
i
don't
care
when
you
build
it,
was
necessary.
the
limitations
were
attributable
to
other
policies.
i
say
if
the
court
up
there
had
any
real
doubt
as
to
what
the
fact
was
as
to
the
finding
made
by
the
wpb,
it
should
have
sent
the
case
back
to
the
tax
court
for
findings
on
the
subject.
we
asked
them
to
do
that.
they
refused.
we
would
still
ask
this
court
to
remand
if
there
is
doubt,
if
there
can
be
doubt,
we
say
there
can
be
none
in
the
face
of
the
record
that
there
was
a
finding
of
necessity
and
that
the
subsidiary
findings
were
due
to
other
unrelated
policies
whether
wise
or

mr.

they
did
it
in
this
way.
mr.
karl
riemer
well
--
well
the
--
mr.
karl
riemer
--
to
that
extent,
i
think
the
--
mr.
karl
riemer
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
with
all
due
respect
--
mr.

misinterpreted
the
decision
of
the
district
of

in
the
district
of
columbia
held
--
in
the
graphite
company
case
that
he
--
he
said
that
he
agreed
with
the
government
interpretation,
but
he
also
said
in
his
opinion
that
mandamus
will
not
lie
to
control
executive
discretion.
that
decision
was
affirmed
per
curiam
with
judge
wilbur
miller
dissenting
in
a
fine
opinion.

can
place
on
the
court
of

mr.
karl

i
think
so.
mr.
karl
riemer
and
i
will

(voice

--
i
will
leave
the
interpretation
--
mr.

of
what
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
did
to
this
court.
