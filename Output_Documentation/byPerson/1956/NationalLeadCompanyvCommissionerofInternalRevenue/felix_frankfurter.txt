do
you
say
that
the
court
of
the
district,
the
court
of
appeals
of--
in
the
district
held
that
mandamus
would
not
lie?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
probably
the
second
circuit
went
to
all
my
knowledge
that's
just
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
quit
the
opinion.
ambiguously
clear
because
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
case
decided
the
opposite
to
remind
you
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
the
district
had
entertained
my
limit
proceeding
to
that
purpose
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
the
(inaudible)
then
they
go
on
to
say,
â€œif
the
petitioner
had
sought
mandamus
or
appropriate
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
of
columbia
happened
successfully
you
can't
imagine
them
in
something
no
matter
somewhere
but
the
court
of
appeals
merely
understood
the
law
of
(inaudible)
and
filed
a
piece
of
paper
which
could
be
thrown
out
of
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
divided
in
your
case,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
look
at
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
if
that
that's
so,
if
you'll
join
the
--
the
possibilities
of
ambiguity
it
can
cause
division.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
zarky
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
from
the
graphite
case,
is
it
important
to
the
court
--
the
decision
in
the
graphite
litigation
and
this
--
this
is
important
certainly
to
the
national
lead
case,
this
position
mr.
riemer
has
one
understanding
of
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
another.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
this,
since
you're
talking
about
this
case.
he
indicated
here,
mr.
riemer
--
i've
looked
at
the
two
opinions
(inaudible)
am
i
wrong
in
saying
this
that
mandamus
was
brought,
judge
pine
decided
on
the
merits
that
the
statute,
and
more
particularly
the
regulation
allowed
partial
certification.
there
was
then
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
confirmed
on
the
opinion
of
judge
pine
went
along
the
dissent
by
judge
wilbur
miller
on
the
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
he
was
without
power
to
entertain
mandamus,
he
would
have
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thrown
the
case
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
judged
that
as
on
the
merits
considering
as
judge
wilbur
miller
indicated
the
issue
really
was,
whether
the
regulation
was
ruled
in
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
--
he
isn't
helpless
if
i
may
intervene
provided
the
agency
is
--
is
in
existence
that
can
exercise
the
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
situation,
this
situation
differs
from
the
holly
hill
because
the
agency
that
was
found
to
have
made
an
erroneous
determinant
was
to
that
existence
to
make
a
correct
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
--
he
has
the
taxpayer
has
no
choice
of
having
the
agency
say
100%
because
there's
no
agency
to
make
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
--
so
therefor
the
conclusion
follows
that
--
that
he's
out
of
luck
and
uncle
sam
which
is
the
enterprise
having
put
the
agency
out
of
business
now
says
too
bad
that
power
which
you
--
which
we
had
in
which
the
opportunity
which
you
had
to
get
100%,
you
haven't
got
because
i
abolished
my
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
partial
haven't
--
it's
i
think
there's
a
misunderstanding
between
you
if
i
may
say
(inaudible)
namely,
if
they
have
to
certify
100%
and
it
is
practical
to
mention
the
case
of
a
mandamus,
but
they
could
certify
either
a
hundred
or
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
--
then
--
then
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
the
difficulty
that
--
that
i
could
see
you
have
with
holly
if
--
and
i
can
assure
you
that
that
is
the
case
that's
very
congenial
to
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
what
--
but
that
kind
of
reference
back
to
an
administrative
agency,
which
has
exceeded
its
powers
must
be
added
the
time
that
it
should
have
exercised
its
powers
legally.
in
other
words,
that's
a
prophetic
judgment
--
a
retrospective
judgment,
administrative
judgment.
and
if
there
still
is
power
today
with
the
secretary
of
commerce,
then
please
tell
me
why
he
should
exercise
a
retrospective
judgment,
i.e.,
what
the
board
would
have
done
if
contemporaneously
it
kept
within
its
alleged
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
you
have
to
answer
me
who's
very
hospitable
to
the
suggestion
of
holly
hill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
taxpayer
is
responsible
for
that
alteration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
this,
because
he
didn't
pursue
his
remedy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
it
just
as
soon
as
he
learned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
why
it
was
somebody
else
or
somebody
had
established
roots
of
which
--
whatever
it
is
had
established
rights
for
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
thought
they
had
filed
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
you
seen
a
lot
of
those
two
together?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
secretary
of
commerce
could
say
today,
looking
back
we
know
they
wouldn't
have
done
that
at
the
time
and
wouldn't
have
given
them
a
hundred
percent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
then
applies
to
prophetic
powers?
i
agree
with
you,
but
--
but
that
maybe
the
secretary
of
commerce
has
got
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
--
the
only
legislative
opportunity
that's
left
is
to
go
and
get
a
private
deal
to
make
up
what
the
courts
have
given
us.
