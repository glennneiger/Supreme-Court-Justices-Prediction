mr.
milton
i.
shadur
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
southern
division.
that
court
refused
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
alabama
solomon
act
against
the
attack
of
the
appellants
here,
claiming
that
that
act
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
that
act
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
and
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
its
most
relevant
provisions
which
began
with
the
first
section.
the
first
section
defines
a
labor
union
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
pardon?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
for
convenience.
a
labor
organization
is
defined
as
any
organization
of
any
kind
in
which
employees
participate
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
one
or
more
employers
concerning
grievances,
labor
disputes,
wages,
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment
or
conditions
of
work.
then,
section
1,
goes
on
to
define
public
employee
briefly
as
any
person
who
is
compensated
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
state
or
by
any
state
agency.
now,
section
2,
which
is
the
key
section
of
this
statute,
provides
very
simply
that
any
public
employee
who
becomes
or
remains
a
member
of
a
labor
union
or
labor
organization
or
who
participates
in
that
union
automatically
forfeits
all
employment
rights,
benefits,
and
privileges
which
he
has
as
a
public
employee.
section
3,
to
which
i'll
refer
a
little
later,
specifically
excludes
from
the
operation
of
the
act,
all
teachers,
all
employees
of
the
state
docks
board,
those
are
people
who
work
for
the
railroad
which
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
state,
and
that
further
excludes
all
city
and
county
employees.
now,
the
issues
in
this
case,
as
we
have
stated
them,
are
whether
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
state
can
constitutionally
bar
a
state
employee.
in
this
case,
a
man
who
is
a
retail
liquor
sales
man
in
a
state-owned
and
operated
liquor
store,
from
his
job
and
any
other
public
employment
solely
because
he
belongs
to
a
labor
union,
whether
the
state
can
compel
that
employee
in
order
to
retain
his
employment
to
resign
his
membership
in
that
organization
because
one
of
it's
ultimate
purposes
is
the
attainment
of
collective
bargaining
relationships
with
government,
with
the
people
with
whom
it
deals
when
and
only
when
the
state
permits
such
collective
bargaining
to
be
carried
on.
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
permits
the
exercise
and
protects
the
exercise
by
that
state
employee
of
his
rights
of
voluntary
association,
his
rights
of
free
speech,
when
those
rights
are
exercised
through
his
membership
in
a
labor
union.
and
finally,
if
and
only
if
all
these
questions
are
determined
against
us,
whether
the
state
can
limit
that
prohibition
so
that
it
excludes
that
prohibition
from
city
employees,
county
employees,
employees
who
are
already
organized
in
the
labor
unions.
now,
the
defendants
don't
join
issue
with
us
on
these
issues.
they
contend
that
the
very
nature
of
this
union
is
such
that
collective
bargaining
is
an
inherent
purpose
which
it
says,
cannot
be
abandoned
voluntarily
except
through
certain
technical
procedures
which
it
says
have
not
been
followed
that
a
person
who
belongs
to
this
union
can't
give
the
state
of
alabama
his
undivided
allegiance
and
that
the
state
can
prohibit
membership
in
point
of
union
in
order
to
ensure
that
undivided
allegiance.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
sir?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
way
i
read
the
district
court
opinions.
the
first
time
that
the
matter
came
before
the
district
court,
it
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
at
that
point,
it
withheld
jurisdiction.
now,
however,
there
has
been
a
specific
adjudication
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
not
as
a
matter
--
not
only
as
a
matter
of
language,
but
a
specific
holding
on
the
identical
record
which
is
before
this
court
which
was
incorporated
by
reference
before
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
as
i
read
that,
your
honor,
that's
simply
saying
that
we
have
seen
and
read
the
application
of
the
solomon
act
to
these
people,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
but
so
reading
that
application,
we
do
not
find
that
to
be
an
unconstitutional
application.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said
and
its
judgment
is
what
speaks
for
the
alabama
supreme
court.
it
has
a
firm,
a
judgment
below
of
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
which
held
that
plaintiff
union,
its
activities
and
its
members
all
as
described
in
the
complaint
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
it's
near
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
we
now
know,
you
honor,
exactly
what
the
statute
means
because
we
can't
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
agree
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
does
not
tell
us,
but
the
alabama
supreme
court
judgment
does
and
it's
the
judgment
–-
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
which
is
determinative
here.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
judgment
is
a
judgment
of
affirmance.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
at
page
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
in
that
paragraph
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
page
144,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
of
the
record.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
it
gives
us
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county.
that's
a
judgment,
which
in
the
second
paragraph,
after
holding
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
states
and
holds
that
the
statute
of
alabama
applies
to
complainant.
that's
the
plaintiff
union
in
this
case,
its
activities
and
its
members
all
as
described
in
the
complaint.
we
have
then
a
fact
situation
which
has
been
presented
to
the
court.
the
court
makes
a
ruling
that
under
that
fact
situation,
this
organization
is
a
union,
a
labor
union,
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
the
case
then
comes
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
affirms
that
judgment.
and
that,
your
honor,
is
--
what
we
say
is
the
binding
application
of
the
solomon
act
to
our
party
here.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear,
the
complex
of
activities
that
this
plaintiff
union
has
engaged
in
as
described
in
the
complaint
and
as
found
in
the
record
is
in
fact
prohibited
by
the
solomon
act
because
that's
an
authoritative
construction
by
the
alabama
courts.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
i
can't
tell
you
whether
i
had
this
organization
done
two
things
less.
it
might
not
had
been
subject
to
the
act,
but
the
thing
that
is
certain
from
this
record
is
that
the
things
which
it
did
have
been
held
subject
to
this
act
and
we
say
that
an
organization
which
has
done
these
things
cannot
be
an
organization
in
which
membership
is
prohibited
for
all
state
employees
as
has
been
done
by
the
solomon
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no
judge,
but
that's
not
relevant,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
agree,
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
your
honor,
we
have
a
fixed
application
of
the
act
to
our
party,
and
that
application
is
the
thing
which
we
say
is
unconstitutional
here.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
that
our
activity
must
be
--
as
it
is
described
in
this
complaint
is
constitutionally
protected
against
the
state
action
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
intended.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
every
item
as
described
in
the
complaint,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
--
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
in
the
argument
to
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
the
sole
--
the
sole
effect
of
the
judgment
was
to
state
that
this
organization,
its
activities,
its
members
as
described
in
the
complaint
is
a
labor
union
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act
and
people
who
belonged
to
this
organization
are
subject
to
all
the
penalties
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that
--
that
must
necessarily
follow
and
that's
why
we're
here
today,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
it's
not
an
abstract
declaration,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
declaration
with
respect
to
facts
which
are
in
the
record.
it
is
not
a
hypothetical
case.
it
is
a
case
dealing
with
facts.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
because
the
judgment
not
only
went
to
the
--
being
subject
to
the
act,
but
in
the
opinion
itself.
the
court
stated
that
there
is
no
question
that
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
this
organization
is
subject
to
the
penalties
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
penalties
of
the
solomon
act
that's
served
--
stated
or
--
are
the
forfeiter
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
lost
of
employment,
lost
of
all
employment
rights
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i'm
not
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
i
can't
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
don't
know.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
let
me
see
if
i
can
deal
with
that
bias
for
a
moment
and
see
exactly
what
these
activities
are
which
were
involved
in
the
--
in
the
record
that
was
before
the
alabama
court
and
on
which
have
nevertheless
held
that
the
solomon
act
apply.
before
the
--
before
the
solomon
act
was
passed,
the
plaintiff
union
had
asked
the
authorities
of
alabama
for
collective
bargaining.
and
specifically,
the
administrators
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
board
which
i'll
call
the
abc
board.
now,
that
right
was
denied
to
them
and
when
that
denial
was
made,
they,
thereafter,
exceeded
to
that
denial,
and
they,
thereafter,
did
not
assert
either
a
right
to
bargain
collectively
nor
a
right
to
strike.
and
i
might
say
that
that
–
their
act
ceding
to
do
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
objects
of
this
union.
the
objects
of
this
union
are
stated
and
the
one
relevant
here
to
increase
the
wages
and
to
improve
the
conditions
of
employment
of
our
members
by
legislation,
negotiation
or
other
legitimate
means.
in
other
words,
at
that
point,
the
union
became
as
described
by
the
only
witness
on
this
subject
basically
a
discussion
group.
i'll
get
to
the
other
activities
which
have
engaged
in
just
a
moment,
but
it
proceeded
to
discuss
with
its
members
privately
and
at
meetings,
such
things
as
federal
social
security
legislation,
public
housing,
economic
and
political
issues,
civil
rights,
political
candidates.
now,
defendants
have
stressed
two
items
of
activity
which
they
claim
are
inconsistent
with
this
characterization,
a
plaintiff
union
as
a
discussion
group.
the
first
item
of
activity
is
--
and
these
are
conceded,
there
is
no
question
about
this.
these
are
part
of
the
record.
plaintiff
union
and
its
members
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
prospective
legislation
to
provide
for
collective
bargaining
for
state
employees,
and
they
thought
about
sponsoring
that
legislation.
similarly,
when
the
solomon
act
was
proposed
in
the
state
legislature,
plaintiff
union
and
its
members
contacted
their
legislators
to
try
to
defeat
that
bill.
now,
the
other
item
of
activity
that
defendants
urge
is
that
prior
to
passage
of
the
solomon
act,
a
representative
of
plaintiff
union
as
part
of
its
practice
of
assisting
its
members
in
connection
with
their
individual
employment
problems
appeared
before
the
alabama
personnel
board
with
some
of
those
members
to
help
settle
the
grievances
which
had
arisen.
now,
promptly
after
passage
of
the
solomon
act,
the
defendant's
predecessors
sent
copies
to
the
bill
to
all
the
liquor
stores
and
stated
that
all
the
employees
had
to
sign
those
to
confirm
the
fact
they
had
read
the
act.
plaintiff
(inaudible)
and
all
the
other
abc
board
employees
did
in
fact
initial
the
act.
immediately
after
that,
the
--
as
the
witness
--
only
witness
on
this
subject
stated,
“the
membership
simply
evaporated
from
250
to
300
members.
the
union
went
down
to
a
point
where
plaintiff
(inaudible)
and
perhaps
one
other
member
remained.
plaintiff
(inaudible)
stated
that
he
remained
a
member
because
he
believed
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
a
member
of
this
organization
in
the
same
manner
that
he
had
a
right
to
belong
to
his
church.
now
then,
we
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
referred
asking
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
the
court
at
that
time
withheld
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
it
abstained.
that
abstention
came
before
this
court
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
at
that
time,
no
construction
of
the
statute
had
been
obtained
from
the
alabama
courts.
at
that
point,
suit
was
filed
in
the
--
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county.
the
judgment
in
the
circuit
court
was
that
the
act
did
apply
to
plaintiff
union,
its
members
and
activities
as
i
have
described
those
activities.
there
are
no
other
elements
which
are
in
the
record
describing
plaintiff's
activities,
plaintiff
union's
activities
as
they
have
been
held
to
be
subject
to
the
solomon
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
originally,
it
was
formed
by
the
cio
as
an
organizing
committee.
an
organizing
committee
is
a
step
prior
to
the
formation
of
an
international
union.
and
it
has
--
has
been
stated
in
the
--
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
original
brief,
consequently
to
the
merger
between
the
cio
and
the
afl.
this
union
has
merged
with
its
afl
affiliated
counterpart,
but
under
the
merger
agreement,
every
member
of
this
union
becomes
and
remains
a
member
of
the
merged
union
and
all
the
rights
also
carry
over
so
that
the
provisions
are
applicable
to
this
court.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
is
in
the
case.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
the
--
there
is
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
there
is
a
specific
area
of
activity
which
has
been
held
subject
to
the
solomon
act.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
each
of
the
provisions
of
the
cio
constitution
to
which
they
refer
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
as
part
of
the
complex
of
this
activity
which
is
subject
to
the
solomon
act
is
also
part
of
the
organization
as
it
stands
there.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
think
that
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
sticking
point
for
the
state
of
alabama
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
the
entire
area
of
activities
that's
involved.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
oh,
but
we
must,
as
your
honor
has
correctly
pointed
out,
state
that
each
one
of
these
activities
is
--
is
inherent
in
the
holding.
that
we
don't
know
whether
one
of
these
being
subtracted
would
nevertheless
result
in
our
being
held
subject
to
the
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
this
organization
continues
to
engage
in
those
activities,
still
as
part
of
a
nationwide
organization
with
the
same
purposes.
i
submit
that
the
record
that
as
before
this
court
is
in
no
way
changed
by
the
fact
that
it
is
now
part
of
an
afl-cio
rather
than
that
it
is
a
part
of
a
cio.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
have
done
so
with
some
difficulty
into
some
way.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
construction
and
by
construction,
i
would
probably
better
use
the
"application"
that
the
application
that
has
been
made
of
the
statute
by
the
alabama
supreme
court,
an
application
which
applies
to
this
union
and
to
its
members
as
those
activities
are
described
in
the
complaint
and
which
i
have
now
described
is
an
unconstitutional
application.
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
requires
really
a
great
deal
of
constitutional
citation
for
that
purpose
because
before
and
now,
the
cases
to
which
we
have
referred
in
our
brief,
the
wieman
case,
the
slochower
case,
adler,
garner.
all
those
cases
have
involved
a
conflict
between
a
state
interest
and
an
interest
of
the
government
employee.
i
submit,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
that
there
is
no
legitimate
state
interest
which
is
here
involved
being
protected
as
a
price
for
taking
away
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
individuals.
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
fact
which
is
the
only
fact
required
for
this
disqualification
for
employment
that
is
the
fact
of
union
membership.
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
fact
of
union
membership
and
unsuitability
for
public
employment.
and
yet,
the
solomon
act
specifically
states
and
the
court,
i
submit,
has
read
it
in
fact
literally
that
any
public
employee
who
is
a
member
of
this
labor
organization
loses
his
rights
of
employment.
and
labor
organization
is
defined
not
as
an
organization
in
which
there
is
insistence
on
collective
bargaining
with
the
state
of
alabama
because
that's
not
in
this
case
nor
is
that
an
organization
which
insist
on
the
right
to
strike
because
that's
not
in
this
case
either.
it
is
only
an
organization
in
which
employees
participate
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
one
or
more
employers
concerning
these
elements.
now,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
this
organization,
the
government
and
civic
employees
organizing
committee
does
deal
with
one
or
more
employers
regarding
these
things
because
it
is
an
organization
that
does
not
restrict
its
activities
to
the
abc
board
and
where
those
activities
of
negotiation
and
bargaining
are
permissible
under
state
law,
it
does
engage
in
them.
but
where
those
activities
are
not
permissible
as
they
were
advised
by
the
defendant's
predecessors
in
this
case,
there
was
no
insistence
on
that
so
that
what
we
have
is
the
bare
activities
which
are
described
in
this
complaint,
discussion,
the
sponsoring
of
legislation,
the
opposition
to
other
legislation
and
the
processing
of
individual
grievances.
only
those
activities
are
involved
in
this
case
and
those
activities
have
been
specifically
held
to
subject
this
union
and
the
employees
who
are
members
of
this
union
to
the
penalties
under
the
solomon
act.
i
submit
that
the
due
process
question
in
this
case
virtually
answers
itself.
this
cannot
satisfy
the
terms
of
this
court's
statements
in
the
slochower
case,
the
wieman
case,
which
require
that
before
there
can
be
restrictions
on
government
employment,
those
restrictions
must
be
reasonable.
they
must
not
be
arbitrary.
they
must
bear
a
relationship
to
this
valid
state
purposes
sought
to
be
obtained.
apparently,
the
defendants
would
equate
the
idea
that
a
government
--
that
a
person
does
not
have
a
right,
the
constitutional
right
to
be
a
government
employee
with
the
conclusion
that
a
government
employee
does
not
have
constitutional
rights,
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
case.
i
think
that
--
perhaps
the
best
characterization
of
the
alabama
position
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
this
organization
is
found
that
they're
--
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
appellees'
brief
in
which
they
refer
to
the
witnesses
--
witness
battle,
the
union
organizers'
testimony
as
to
sponsoring
legislation
and
say,
“this
testimony
not
only
tends
to
show
that
the
union
is
not
a
mere
discussion
group
as
claimed,
but
that
the
union
and
the
state
employee
members
thereof
have
engaged
in
sponsoring
collective
bargaining
legislation
for
state
employees
and
--
and
have
attempted
to
defeat
legislation
which
prohibits
collective
bargaining.
as
individuals,
the
constitutional
right
is
there,
but
as
state
employees,
it
is
not.
such
action
is
contrary
to
the
declared
public
policy
of
the
state
of
alabama.
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
third
public
policy
of
the
state
of
alabama
cannot
prevail
over
this
court's
decisions
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
due
process
protection.
now,
what
do
defendants
fallback
on?
they
turned
to
cases
and
various
state
board
cases
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
policemen
and
firemen
may
be
prohibited
from
engaging
in
union
activity
and
indeed
from
unionization.
but
each
one
of
those
cases
was
rested
specifically
on
the
proposition
that
there
are
special
problems,
special
semi-military
problems
which
relates
to
policemen
and
firemen.
they
--
each
one
of
them
has
rested
on
the
proposition
that
the
police
and
fire
departments
are
in
a
class
apart.
both
are
at
times
charged
with
the
preservation
of
the
public
order
and
for
men,
of
all
reasons,
they
owe
to
the
public
their
undivided
allegiance.
the
power
in
the
state
of
complete
control
is
imperatively
necessary
if
discipline
is
to
be
maintained.
now,
even
if
those
decisions
are
available,
and
that's
a
problem
that
will
come
before
this
court
in
another
case
which
is
now
pending
on
its
document.
that
statute,
those
cases
and
the
statutes
and
ordinances
which
relate
there
would
not
control
this
case
because
there
you
have
the
narrowly
drawn
statutes
dealing
with
perhaps
a
permissible
problem.
but
the
same
considerations
of
this
public
order,
safety,
unqualified
discipline
which
apply
to
the
policemen
and
firemen
do
not
apply
to
permit
the
prohibition
of
union
organization
and
participation
among
all
state
employee.
plaintiff
(inaudible)
is
certainly
not
in
a
class
apart.
he
is
a
liquor
store
clerk.
indeed,
the
solomon
act
actually
accepts
from
its
application,
these
policemen
and
firemen
as
city
and
county
employees
indeed
in
anomalous
result
if
the
purpose
of
this
act,
the
purpose
of
a
legislation
is
to
ensure
the
undivided
allegiance,
the
necessary
maintenance
of
complete
discipline.
there
is
no
question
that
public
employment
and
private
employment
are
different.
defendants
urged
that
at
length
and
we
certainly
agree,
but
what
defendants
fail
to
recognize,
or
perhaps
refused
to
recognize,
is
that
the
basic
difference
between
those
two
types
of
employment
is
what
brings
us
into
court
today.
that
is
that
the
public
action,
the
public
employer
when
he
acts
engages
in
state
action
which
is
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
state
action
which
is
represented
by
the
solomon
act
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
that
amendment.
i
might
refer
just
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor,
we
claim
that
that
--
that
that
and
i
was
about
to
speak
to
that,
that
that
in
itself
is
an
arbitrary
discrimination
which
does
two
things.
first,
it
breaches
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
the
--
the
exclusion
from
themselves
are
arbitrary
with
respect
to
the
coverage
that
are
brought
there.
and
secondly,
i
think
it
points
up
even
more
sharply
the
fact
that
the
statute
itself
is
discriminatory
because
in
the
absence
of
those
exclusions,
they
might
make
an
argument.
i
don't
say
that
it
is
justified
by
this
record
and
in
fact,
it
is
not,
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
guard
against
the
attempt
to
fix
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
by
collective
bargaining,
but
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
it's
not
restricted
to
that
but
the
employees
who
are
referred
to
here
are
the
railroad
employees,
yes,
your
honors.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
they
are
members
of
several
brotherhoods
of
railroad
employees.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
i
submit
that
no
consideration
can
be
conceived
which
would
justify
the
--
the
exclusion
of
the
city
and
county
employees
and
the
inclusion
of
the
state
employees,
for
this
reason.
when
you
have
is
--
was
the
case
before
this
court
in
the
mcadory
case
to
which
defendants
refer,
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
state
is
regulating
an
area
of
activity.
at
that
point,
it
may
exclude
an
area
of
--
part
of
that
area
which
it
considers
is
already
ampli-regulated
and
that
was
this
court's
holding
in
mcadory.
but
when
the
form
of
the
state
legislation
is
to
prohibit
absolutely
an
area
of
activity
than
to
engage
in
exclusions
from
that
prohibition
which
have
no
relationship
whatever
to
any
legitimate
state
interest
cannot
possibly
satisfy
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
i
--
the
only
distinction
that
exists
here,
because
if
you'll
notice,
the
exclusions
do
not
limit
themselves,
only
to
employees
of
cities
or
counties,
they
include
the
teachers,
they
include
these
employees
of
the
state
tax
board.
and
the
only
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
what
are
the
distinctions
as
between
them?
certainly,
if
there
is
any
evil
and
neither
defendants
nor
the
state
courts
in
the
state
of
alabama
have
ever
articulated
just
what
that
evil
is.
but
if
there
is
any
evil
in
the
existence
of
union
organization
among
state
employees,
how
can
it
be
said
that
that
evil
does
not
extend
equally
to
these
areas
of
completely
arbitrary
exclusion?
there
is
one
difference
between
them
and
that
one
difference
is
shown
in
appendix
a
and
that
difference
is
that
the
people
who
are
excluded
are
people
who
are
already
engaging
in
negotiation.
now,
that,
your
honor,
is
certainly
not
a
suitable
distinction
to
excuse
an
exclusion
from
a
prohibition
against
union
organization
to
say,
"well,
these
people
are
already
within
the
area
of
evil.
they're
already
engaging
in
collective
bargaining.
therefore,
we
will
exclude
them
from
the
provisions
of
an
act
which
prohibits
collective
bargaining
and
union
organization
among
state
employees.”
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
teachers.
there
is
in
the
record
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
12
which
we
printed
as
appendix
a
to
our
reply
brief,
specific
affidavit
covering
the
fact
that
since
1936,
the
railroad
brotherhoods
have
negotiated
schedules
of
wages
and
rules
covering
the
employees
of
the
state
dock
--
docks
board
and
further
that
there
are
municipal
and
county
employees
in
alabama
who
are
members
of
labor
organizations
that
negotiate
their
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
only
with
respect
to
the
state
docks
board
employees
that
refers
to
the
fact
that
they
are
affiliated
with
the
brotherhoods.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but,
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
act
by
the
state
court.
that
is
a
matter
of
a
legislative
exclusion
and
the
legislative
--
if
the
distinction
between
them
had
to
do
with
the
degree
of
affiliation
with
a
union,
an
international
union,
then
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
exclude
them
from
the
operation
of
the
act.
that
would
take
the
course
of
the
state
determination
by
the
court
as
to
what
constitutes
a
labor
organization
if
the
total
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
though,
the
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
but
the
legislature
has
not
so
said.
the
legislature
has
said
that
irrespective
of
--
with
whom
the
employees
of
cities
or
counties,
with
whom
the
teachers,
with
whom
the
employees
of
the
state
docks
board
maybe
affiliated,
we
will
exclude
them
from
the
act.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
that
only
appears
in
the
record
from
inference
because
the
exhibit
12
to
which
i
referred
states
that
substantially
all
employees
belong
to
these
organizations.
it
said
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
to
the
brotherhood,
but
there
are
others
which
may
belong
to
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
they
seem
to
distinguish
between
the
state-owned
liquor
stores
and
the
state-owned
railroads,
whatever
the
basis
for
the
distinction.
i
might
advert
before
i
close
just
very
briefly
to
a
--
an
argument
as
to
standing
which
was
made
by
the
appellees
in
the
concluding
portion
of
their
brief.
they
state
that
the
appellant
union
who
does
not
have
standing
in
this
court
because
this
court
held
in
hague
against
the
cio
that
only
natural
persons
were
entitled
for
the
privileges
and
immunities
that
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
secured
for
united
states
citizens.
of
course,
that
has
no
application
here.
there
is
no
question,
although
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
labor
organization
is
not
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
protection
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
that
it
is
most
certainly
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
is
the
clause
which
we
are
invoking
here.
i
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
alabama
courts
have
construed
the
solomon
act
in
the
only
matter
in
which
the
court
can
ever
construe
an
act,
that
is
by
rendering
a
judgment
on
a
specific
record
as
to
the
applicability
of
that
act.
on
that
specific
record,
it
was
held
that
the
solomon
act
applies
to
this
union
and
to
the
members
of
this
union
and
their
activities
all
as
described
in
the
complaint.
that
record
is
the
identical
record
before
this
court.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
can
be
speculated
as
to
the
fact
that
on
the
record
before
this
court,
the
alabama
courts
might
hold
otherwise
because
the
alabama
courts
have
held
specifically
on
this
record
that
this
union
is
subject
to
the
act.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
constitutional
question
is
squarely
here
and
i
submit
there
can
only
be
one
answer
to
that
constitutional
question.
the
solomon
act,
as
it
has
been
authoritatively
applied
by
the
alabama
courts,
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor
i
will.
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
a
good
deal
of
clarification
can
be
obtained
here
if
we
see
exactly
what
the
course
of
this
litigation
was
and
why
the
issues
were
raised
in
the
places
that
they
were.
we
start
out
with
the
immediately
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
solomon
act
with
this
union
which
engaged
in
activities
which
we
will
assume
for
the
moment
are
constitutionally
protected.
now,
then,
the
solomon
act
is
passed
at
that
point.
in
literal
terms
the
solomon
act
applies
to
the
point
of
union.
at
that
point
employees
begin
to
leave
it
and
the
union
goes
to
a
point
where
from
250
members
you
end
up
with
one.
we,
thereupon,
go
into
the
federal
district
court
in
order
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
solomon
act.
and
the
court
tells
us,
"no.
you
can't
do
that
because
although
perhaps
the
solomon
act
literally
read,
is
unconstitutional.
we
cannot
presume
that
the
alabama
courts
will
so
construed
it."
they
then
say,
"we
will
abstain
from
exercising
our
jurisdiction
until
such
time
as
a
construction
of
the
statute
may
be
obtained
from
the
alabama
courts."
now,
then,
we
go
into
the
state
courts.
we
file
the
same
complaint
because
we
have
the
same
activities.
but
because
we're
doing
it
in
order
to
obtain
a
construction
so
that
the
constitutional
question
which
is
then
pending
before
the
district
court,
the
united
states
district
court
can
be
raised
with
the
benefit
of
an
authoritative
construction
of
the
act,
we
then
raise
it
in
exactly
the
manner
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
stated.
we
put
the
fact
situation
before
the
court.
at
that
point
having
put
the
fact
situation
before
the
court
we
say,
give
us
a
declaratory
judgment
on
this
real
controversy
which
exists
between
this
union
and
the
state
of
alabama
as
to
whether
this
statute
on
these
activities
can
apply
to
this
union.
because
if
it
is
applied,
it
would
raise
serious
constitutional
questions.
and
we
stated
specifically
in
the
complaint
that
the
purpose
of
this
action,
and
this
is
at
pages
77
and
78
of
the
record.
this
bill
for
declaration
of
complainant's
rights
is
brought
in
part
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama
case
number
7466.
and
we
asserted
that
the
respondents
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
pardon?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
to
obtain
construction
by
the
courts
of
alabama
which
is
exactly
the
reason
that
we
were
bringing
the
complaint.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
why
did
we
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
in
which
complaint,
your
honor?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
in
the
state
court,
the
only
reference
to
a
possible
allegation
of
unconstitutionality
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
in
paragraph
10.
but
we
specifically
brought
this
action
for
construction,
for
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
federal
court
already
had
jurisdiction,
for
purposes
of
determining
the
constitutionality.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
already
had
a
case
pending.
the
only
reason
for
any
alabama
state
court
proceeding
at
all
is
because
the
judgement
of
the
alabama
state
courts
on
what
the
statute
means,
on
the
construction
of
the
statute,
is
binding
on
the
federal
courts
but
the
court
which
first
had
jurisdiction
was
the
federal
district
court,
the
three-judge
court.
that
was
a
court
in
which
the
constitutional
question
had
been
raised
and
was
pending
subject
only
to
the
obtaining
of
a
construction
to
see
whether
our
constitutional
question
may
not
have
been
premature
but
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
your
honor,
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
the
question
as
presented
to
us,
is
confronted
with
an
argument
that
if
it
construes
the
statute
so
as
to
cover
these
activities,
serious
constitutional
problems
will
be
raised.
if
the
alabama
supreme
court,
nevertheless,
applies
the
statute
to
us,
the
constitutional
question
which
we
have
preserved
in
the
three-judge
district
court
is
at
point
available
to
us
and
ripe
for
determination.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
and
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
only
reason
that
we
were
in
the
state
courts
was
to
secure
the
construction.
this
is
exactly
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor
we
did
not.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
think
we
would
have
been
in
the
worst
position
in
that
situation.
i
think,
that
the
pendency
of
the
--
the
three-judge
court
proceeding
and
the
fact
that
our
proceeding
into
the
alabama
courts
was
in
order
to
comply
with
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
is
a
--
is
an
extremely
significant
fact
in
this
case
because
we
were
directed
to
go
to
the
alabama
courts,
not
directed
to
go
there
to
--
to
raise
the
conditional
question
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
question
of
barring.
it
was
a
question
of
--
of
the
terms
of
the
direction
which
the
district
court
gave
us.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
district
court
then
told
us
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
to
go,
to
get
a
construction
of
the
statue
and
go
to
get
a
construction
of
the
statute
we
did.
and
we
obtained
that
construction.
now
then
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
in
the
record.
you're
having
to
hear
it.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i'll
find
it.
and
that's
--
in
the
--
at
page
50.
pages
49
and
50.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
providing
that
the
action
is
not
dismissed
but
is
retained
and
will
remain
pending
for
a
reasonable
time
to
permit
the
exhaustion
of
such
state
administrative
and
judicial
remedies
as
may
be
available.
and
immediately
following
that
on
page
50,
was
our
emotion
filed
in
the
court
in
which
we
advised
them
that
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
entered
on
november
9,
appropriate
proceedings
will
be
brought
promptly
by
plaintiffs
for
construction
of
the
alabama
statute
here
involved.
now,
then,
having
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
except
in
the
inferential
manner
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
referred.
in
the
--
in
the
brief
at
page
2
in
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
step,
the
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
appellants
here,
in
our
brief
had
as
point
c.
"if
the
statute
be
construed
as
the
community
insists,
grave
issues
as
to
it's
constitutionality
will
be
avoided
there,"
and
it
goes
on
citing
the
same
cases
which
we
refer
to
here,
wieman
against
updegraff.
stating
that
that
is
so,
that
is
the
avoidance
of
the
constitutional
issues
because
public
employees
enjoy
all
the
constitutional
rights
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause.
they
cannot
be
removed
from
public
employment
in
violation
of
those
basic
rights.
citing
wieman,
we
go
on
to
say
that
the
alabama
statute
before
this
court,
if
applied
to
this
committee
would
be
incompatible
with
an
exercise
of
the
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
assembly,
quoting
and
citing
from
thomas
against
collins.
and
stating,
referring
specifically
to
the
federal
district
court
proceedings
in
which
we
had
challenged
the
unconstitutionality,
referring
to
what
the
federal
district
court
had
done
in
directing
us
to
go
to
the
alabama
court
and
stating
that
this
is
why
we
were
before
the
alabama
court.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
my
recollection,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
the
argument
which
is
now
appraised
as
the
equal
protection
argument
in
this
court
was
not
raised
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
one
that
i've
just
read
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
--
before
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor.
that
we
--
i
say
that
that
argument
was
not
raised
in
the
same
term.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
it's
a
substantial
point
here.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
your
honor,
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
on
the
very
issues
which
are
here
stated,
conscious
of
the
united
states
constitution,
has
held
this
union
and
its
activities
as
coming
within
the
solomon
act.
at
the
time
when
it
knew
that
we
have
a
pending
proceeding
which
involved
and
attacked
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
if
it
were
applied
to
our
organization
and
with
an
argument
that
raised
that
problem.
subsequent
to
that
ruling,
we
came
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
said
we
have
an
authoritative
construction,
which
is
what
you
sent
us
to
alabama
for.
and
having
obtained
that
construction
we
know
say,
that
this
statute
as
so
applied
to
us,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
your
honor,
in
--
in
passing
on
the
application
of
the
statute
the
state
supreme
court
has
reviewed
in
all
aspects,
whether
this
statute
can
or
cannot
covered
our
union.
in
exactly,
the
same
manner
as
for
example
in
the
spector
cases,
which
came
before
this
court,
in
which
there
was
also
the
situation
of
abstention
from
jurisdiction.
and
after
this
court
directed
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
who
were
attacking
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
connecticut
taxing
statute,
directed
those
people
to
go
to
the
state
courts
of
connecticut.
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
refused
to
pass
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
the
federal
constitutional
right.
it
decided
what
the
construction
of
the
statute
was,
in
light
of
the
fact,
that
there
was
already
a
district
court
proceeding
pending.
and
armed
with
that
construction,
the
plaintiffs
then
came
back
to
the
federal
courts
and
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
decided
the
merits
that
that
statute
as
so
applied
by
the
connecticut
court
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
the
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies
that
was
directed
by
the
united
states
district
court
was
to
secure
a
construction.
because
the
thing
that
the
united
states
district
court
hypothesized,
your
honor,
was
that
it
was
possible
that
this
statute
although
literally
it
did
not
so
read,
might
be
applied
only
to
cover
an
organization
in
which
members
belong
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
collective-bargaining.
that
issue
is
no
longer
in
this
case.
this
has
--
we
have
arrived
at
a
conclusive
construction
and
we
know
have
the
opportunity
to
raise
this
problem.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
an
authoritative
finding
in
the
alabama
supreme
court?
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
there
is
no
specific
statement
in
the
holding
with
respect
to
that
problem,
to
my
recollection.
i
might
say
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
the
attorney
general,
also
argued
and
much
more
directly
than
our
argument
in
the
briefs,
in
the
alabama
supreme
court,
that
the
solomon
act
is
valid
and
is
not
subject
to
constitutional
objection.
necessarily,
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decisions
with
the
arguments
that
had
been
placed
before
it,
subsumed
the
constitutional
question
even
though
that
they
may
not
have
said
in
so
many
terms.
we
find
that
we
can
constitutionally
do
so.
they
have
said,
"well,
we
don't
think
that
the
activities
of
these
people
are
strictly
such
and
so.
we
also
find
this
and
therefore
this
people
are
a
labor
union
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act."
but
having
had
the
arguments
presented
to
them,
if
they
did,
both
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
ourselves,
they
necessarily
had
to
pass
that
problem
in
order
to
find
the
statute
applied.
because
if
they
found
the
statute
applied
and
as
so
applied
was
unconstitutional,
then
they
would
either
have
to
say,
"we
will
construe
the
statue
differently"
or
we
will
say
that
it
would
apply,
but
having
so
applied
it,
it
is
unconstitutional
statue.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
well,
in
order
to
avoid
that
problem,
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
the
--
that
discrimination
argument
from
our
point
of
view
is
a
constitutional
argument
in
this
court.
we
would
--
if
--
if
that
were
a
preliminarily
question,
we
would
consider
that
only
to
the
extent
that
it
indicated
a
violation
of
due
process.
so,
there
is
no
--
in
other
words,
that
the
due
process
argument
is
enhanced
by
the
exclusions
from
the
statue
to
the
same
extent
that
the
basic
classification
is
arbitrary.
so,
are
the
exclusions
arbitrary
and
show
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
this
statute
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
attempting
to
do
so.
i
say
that
--
i
think
that
this
statute
flounders
so
badly
on
the
due
process
clause
that
the
equal
protection
problem
is
not
necessary
to
the
case.
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
--
mr.
milton
i.
shadur
i
can
only
hope
that
you
do,
your
honor.
