well,
isn't
that
all
you
sought,
sir?
it
wasn't
your
action
one
for
an
injunction
upon
the
ground
that
you
were
not
involved,
a
labor
union
or
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act.

now,
they
simply
determine
that
you
were
a
labor
union
or
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
--
that's
the
some
total
of
it,
isn't
it?
