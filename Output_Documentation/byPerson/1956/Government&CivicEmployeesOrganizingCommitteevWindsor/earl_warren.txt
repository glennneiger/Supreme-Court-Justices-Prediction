chief

earl

where
is
that
to
be
found,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
you
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shadur,
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
mentioned
that
it
was
an
anomalous
situation
that
they
would
--
would
prohibit
the
state
employees
and
not
city
and
county
employees
in
joining
such
organization.
do
you
claim
that
it's
more
than
an
anomaly
or
did
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
in
your
state
docks
board,
you
have
--
you
have
employees
who
are
--
are
not
affiliated
with
the
brotherhoods,
haven't
you?
perhaps
you
have
a
great
plenty
people
working
around
the
--
the
docks
for
the
maintenance
of
the
docks,
the
buildings
and
so
forth
and
--
and
they're
exempted,
too,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
substantially
all
to
the
brotherhood?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
have
the
right
--
does
it
have
the
right
under
your
state
constitution
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
employees
in
cities
and
counties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
with
teachers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
they'll
leave
the
teachers
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
teachers
in
higher
education,
aren't
they
under
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
--
why
would
they
eliminate
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
leave
out
saying
--
say
policemen
and
--
and
say
firemen
and
county
sheriffs
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
they
leave
them
out
when
they
--
when
they
took
a
--
a
liquor
sales?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
my
point
is
this,
some
of
those
are
local
and
some
of
them
were
statewide.
now,
is
there
anything
to
the
argument
of
counsel
to
the
effect
that
the
legislature
just
said,
"well,
those
that
are
argued,
we're
not
going
to
fight
with.
we
--
we'll
let
that
be
a
fat
accompli,
but
as
to
others,
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
prohibit
it."
is
there
anything
to
that
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood
counsel,
there
were
--
there
were
unions
in
the
cities
and
in
the
counties
among
the
employees.
there
were
--
there
were
unions
in
the
docks,
the
state
docks
employees.
now,
did
the
legislature
just
say,
as
a
matter
of
expediency,
that
we'll
exempt
all
those
who
are
organized
but
we
will
prevent
those
that
are
not
organized
from
ever
becoming
organized,
because
that
would
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
classification,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
the
thing
i
can't
understand
is,
what
is
--
why
did
they
eliminate
some
of
these
people
and
the
people
in
higher
education?
why
--
why
wouldn't
â€“
why
wouldn't
they
be
just
as
amenable
to
it
as
a
--
as
a
salesman
in
the
state
liquor
store?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
madison.
chief
justice

warren
number
423,
government
and
civic
employees
organizing
committee,
cio,
an
unincorporated
association,
et
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
supply
us
with
a
copy
of
that
brief
so
we
--
we
may
read
it
for
ourselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
you
just
state
as
accurately
as
you
can
what
was
stated
in
that
--
in
that
brief
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
we're
talking
about
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
this
--
on
this
particular
subject
that
the
--
that
the
constitutional
question
was
not
being
raised.
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say
as
the
brief
showed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
madison,
i
haven't
quite
got
an
answer
to
--
to
the
question.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
petitioner,
in
its
brief
in
the
state
court
and
its
argument
represented
to
the
court
that
there
was
not
a
constitutional
question
involved.
that
it
was
only
the
question
as
to
whether
the
ex-conduct
of
--
of
the
petitioner
constituted
or
brought
them
in
--
within
the
act
itself.
now,
is
that
--
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
if
i'm
correct
in
--
in
my
recollection
of
what
you
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
percentage
of
your
employees
of
your
port
authority
that
--
that's
mentioned
in
here,
along
the
brotherhoods?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
act
say
so?
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shadur,
and
would
you
respond
to
that
particular
phase
of
the
case
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shadur
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
you
--
you
get
off
of
that
matter.
can
we
assume
that
you
and
the
--
and
the
attorney
general
are
--
are
in
accord,
to
the
effect,
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
not
raised
either
in
your
briefs
or
in
your
arguments
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
authoritative
finding
on
the
part
of
your
--
your
supreme
court
in
alabama,
to
the
effect
that
this
act
as
applied
to
you
is
constitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
how
can
we
know
then
that
they
would
find
that
--
that
is
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
--
you
--
you
rely
heavily
on
the
question
of
discrimination
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
not
argue
that
all
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
as
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
that
we
didn't
take
any
stock
in
the
rest
of
your
argument,
but
did
rely
on
that.
would
there
have
been
a
finding
in
your
supreme
court
based
upon
on
argument,
that
--
that
it
was
not
subject
to
the
objection
of
discrimination?
