allegation
of
the

i'm
looking
at

its

so
forth.
justice
william
j.

i'm
asking
you
what
it
means
as
you
understand
it.

justice

i've
thought
your
position
was
that
the
petition,

court
the
second
clause
it
says
looking
for
the
old
picture.
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

but
did
the
alabama
supreme
court
say,
you
notice
of
internal
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
understand
it,
within
the
purview
of
solomon
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
they
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
forces
within
the
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it'd
fair
to
say
that
you
neither
sort
nor
desired
a
determination
of
the
alabama
court
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality
because
you
felt
that
was
pending
in
the
federal
court
and
wanted
it
determined
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
place
particular
significance
in
the
fact
that
this
three-judge
proceeding
was
pending
in
the
district
court?
for
example,
suppose
you
had
not
brought
any
proceeding
at
all
in
the
federal
court
until
after
the
proceeding
in
the
alabama
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
have
been
in
a
better
or
worst
position
in
your
view
than
you
are
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
have
any
feeling
that
you
would
be
barred
under
the
instructions
you
had
from
the
district
court
from
raising
the
constitutional
question
in
the
alabama
court?
