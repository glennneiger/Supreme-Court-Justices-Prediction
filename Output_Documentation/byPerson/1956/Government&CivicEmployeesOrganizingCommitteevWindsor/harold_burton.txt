that's
the
one
on
page
30
of
your
--
justice
harold
burton
beginning
on
page
30
of
the
appendix
b
of
your
statement
of
jurisdiction?
justice
harold
burton
and
while
you're
on
that
supreme
--
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
which
there's
nothing
about
pulling
it
constitutional
and
you
--
you
interpreted
as
in
feasibly
holding
a
constitutional
for
it
is
passed
on
constitutional
question
itself?
justice
harold
burton
that's
what
they
said
explicitly,
that
we
tell
you
within
it
and
said
nothing
about
the
constitutionality.
justice
harold
burton
and
it
can't
be
subject
that
it's
constitutional?
justice
harold
burton
can
you
satisfy
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
pass
on
constitutionality
--
justice
harold
burton
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
not
passed
on
the
question
in
the
federal
constitutionality
with
that?
justice
harold
burton
it
was
not
ready
for
a
federal
court
to
pass
something?
justice
harold
burton
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
was
studiously
avoided
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
in
the
supreme
court
likewise?
justice
harold
burton
and
this
was
put
in
neither
the
lower
state
court
nor
the
supreme
court,
the
state
has
passed
on
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
harold
burton
but
then
if
we
should
rule
upon
the
--
on
issue
as
now
presented
to
us
and
would
mean
that
we
might
be
declaring
unconstitutional,
an
act
of
the
state
of
alabama,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
not
passed
on
that
issue.
justice
harold
burton
this
case,
the
federal
district
court
held
the
case
and
--
and
asked
you
to
go
back
and
exhaust
your
state
remedies.
you
went
back
and
exhausted
them
on
the
--
on
the
statutory
construction
but
didn't
say
a
thing
about
the
constitutional
question
that's
not
been
exhausted.
although
it's
within
their
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
it.
