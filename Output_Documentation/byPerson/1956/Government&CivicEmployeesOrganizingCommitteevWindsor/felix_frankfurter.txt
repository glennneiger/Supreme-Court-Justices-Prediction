justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
shadur.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sorry
to
interrupt
you
very
early,
but
i
would
be
able
to
follow
your
argument
and
meet
the
argument
of
this
case
much
more
understandingly
if
you'd
be
good
enough
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
as
they're
not
clear
in
the
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
decree
from
which
we
are
appealing
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
judge
reed's
amended
rules.
it
didn't
go
to
the
merits.
it
didn't
go
to
the
issues
that
you've
just
summarized
at
all,
as
i
understand
it.
it
adhered
to
the
earlier
decision
which
came
here
in
which
that
court
held
that
it
can't
tell
what
the
statute
means
until
the
state
court
has
elucidated
its
quote
and
meaning
that
that
which
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
in
262
alabama,
merely
said
that
this
is
--
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
but
it
didn't
tell
you
what
the
term
of
the
statute
--
it
didn't
--
it's
within
the
range
of
the
statute,
but
it
didn't
tell
you
what
the
contents
are
that
brings
somebody
within.
would
you
please
tell
me
what
all
that
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
what
they
say,
is
it
premature
they're
still
holding
the
case?
you
get
a
constructive
statute,
non-concept
of
state
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
will
so
construe
it
that
to
take
away
any
claim
of
unconstitutionality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
tell
me
what
that
sentence
mean.
after
the
federal
reading
and
consideration
of
the
final
decree
of
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
in
equity
and
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
here
before
mentioned,
it
is
clear
to
us
that
the
alabama
court
says
not
construed
but
the
--
the
solomon
has
entered
in
such
a
manner
as
the
arraignment
on
constitutional.
of
course,
we
cannot
assume
that
the
state
court
will
ever
so
construe
such
statute.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
has
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
the
statute
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
that
tell
me
what
the
provisions
of
solomon
act
are
as
construable
by
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
this
morning,
any
instance
and
if
you
couldn't
tell
from
a
statute
what
it
means,
you
have
to
get
the
court
to
tell
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
you
don't
know
more
than
i
do,
known
outside
where
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
thing
--
(inaudible)
that
--
mr.
shadur
says
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
statute
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
circuit
court
judgment
is
on
page
28
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
144.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
don't
know
what
it
is
that
you're
forbidden
or
not
forbidden
that
you're
required
to
do
or
required
not
to
do
under
the
solomon
act.
and
if
the
strange
thing
to
have
neither
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
tell
me
that
nor
the
district
court
in
which
judge
reed
is
a
senior
member.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
an
awful
--
awful
vacation
undefined,
for
me,
undefined
scope
of
an
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
tell
from
this
record
--
and
i
tell
from
this
record
what
particular
thing
carved
out
from
your
activities
if
you
cease
to
do
would
still
be
allowed
in
the
solomon
act
and
what
--
be
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
not
to
be
within
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
do
i
understand
this
then,
that
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
no
single
thing
in
that
--
in
your
activity
may
be
prohibited
by
the
alabama
legislature,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
burden
then
is,
you
--
you
say
this
means
to
you
that
everything
that
you
set
forth
in
your
complaint
seeking
to
enjoin
the
act
is
not
--
is
non-enjoinable,
because
if
something
in
it
is
enjoinable
and
that
hasn't
been
carved
out,
non-concept
but
that's
enjoinable,
and
therefore,
your
complaint
is
all
good.
i
must
state,
it's
a
very
--
it's
a
very
obscure
basis
on
which
to
enjoin
the
state
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
constitutional
law.
i'm
talking
about
the
respect
due
by
a
district
court
in
enjoining
state
legislation.
and
we
know
very
well
the
law
that
brought
about
the
three-judge
court
against
the
readiness
of
district
judges
to
declare
a
state
legislation
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
agree
that
you
must
say
that
nothing
that
you
do,
everything
that
you
do
must
be
--
cannot
constitutionally
be
--
be
touched
by
--
by
the
--
by
alabama,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
item,
every
item.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
–
it's
non-concept
as
alabama
and
we
know
the
--
the
diversity
of
the
state
rulings
as
the
implication
of
justice
burton's
question.
when
i
read
that
alabama
supreme
court
opinion,
i
first
thought
that
all
they
decided
and
i'm
not
still
clear
that
it
isn't
all
they
decided.
we,
now
telling
you're
within
it.
we're
not
called
upon
to
tell
you
whether
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
see
they
necessarily
follows.
it's
maybe
merely
a
declaration
that
you're
within
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
an
abstract
declaration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it's
hypothetical,
abstract
is
something
else
again.
i
mean
by
that,
they
merely
say,
"we
now
tell
you,
you're
within
the
term
of
the
act."
but
whether
you
--
whether
you
want
to
contest
it,
whether
you
are
subject
to
the
penalty,
is
that
another
story
and
come
again
if
you
want
us
to
pass
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
court
might
do
that
if
it
wanted
or
couldn't
it?
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
gave
you
notice.
what
are
the
penalties?
are
they
penal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
penal
provisions?
any
penal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
recalling
and
--
and
they
will
be.
isn't
alabama
one
of
the
states
that
does
give
advisory
opinions?
i
-–
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
constitution
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
they
can't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
it's
a
very
--
i
tell
you
at
the
outset,
my
prejudice,
my
personal
--
not
prejudice
but
bias
against
declaring
a
state
act
unconstitutional
on
such
a
speculative
and
argumentative
record.
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
deal
with
my
advice.
i'll
just
say
that
i
call
it
a
bias
out
of
deference.
i
think
the
good
sound
principle
not
to
knock
out
state
legislation
revenue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
i
may
have
been
not
inattentive,
but
looking
at
something
else,
in
dealing
under
to
that
sense.
did
you
state
that
this
union
was
--
was
organically
related
to
the
cio?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
--
in
the
burden
that
is
yours,
you
have
to
contend
that
this
union
merely
because
it
is
--
it
has
a
--
a
tie
with
as
part
of
the
merger
of
--
of
the
cio
union,
but
that's
the
difficulty
that
if
you
do
everything
so
far
as
doing
sponsoring
them,
it
could
do
everything
it's
doing,
provided
it
did
it
on
its
own.
is
that
in
the
case
for
all
we
know?
for
all
we
know,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
might
say,
"you
can
carry
on
all
the
activities,
but
you
can't
carry
it
on
affiliated
with
the
afl
and
cio.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
know
it
isn't?
how
do
i
know
it
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
i
know
it
isn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
spite
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
refers
to
this
time
and
for
all
i
know,
that's
the
difficulty
in
the
eyes
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
needless
to
say,
i'm
not
talking
about
myself.
do
you
think
there
might
be
--
for
one
--
for
one
person,
for
me,
might
there
be
a
legal,
a
different
legal
question
to
outlaw
these
activities
as
such
and
to
outlaw
the
collective
doing
of
those
activities
as
part
of
the
afl-cio.
might
there
not
be
a
legal
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
same
thing
though.
it's
one
thing
for
me
to
do
something
on
my
own.
it's
another
thing
for
me
to
do
something,
connects
with
somebody
else.
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
valid
distinction.
all
i'm
saying,
do
i
know
on
this
record
that
that
is
in
the
sticking
point
with
supreme
court
of
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
not
--
am
i
not
entitled
to
think
that
it
might
be
the
sticking
point
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
same
thinking
of
which
you've
had
in
their
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
no
--
i
don't
think
you're
justified
in
saying
that.
that's
my
point
that
i
do
not
know
on
what
ground
the
alabama
supreme
court
went.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
make
myself
clear.
there
are
two
things
for
me.
one,
the
activity
that
people
in
alabama
engages.
two,
the
fact
that
they
engage
in
--
engage
in
those
activities
as
part
of
a
nationwide,
almost
an
international
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
ask
you
one
more
question
and
i'll
desist.
is
it
--
is
it
therefore
my
understanding
that
one
is
to
pass,
one
--
that
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
state
of
alabama
may,
while
allowing
membership,
while
allowing
its
employees
in
various
branch
of
its
government
to
organize
in
and
of
themselves
may
prohibit
them
from
being
part
of
the
afl-cio
organization?
is
that
the
issue
before
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
how
do
i
know
it
isn't?
leave
the
opinion
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
encourage
me,
because
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
--
do
we
know
what
the
scope
of
autonomy
or
a
home
rule
as
the
phrase
runs
gave
in
alabama
city
and
county?
you've
indicated
that
the
docks
board
has
charged
in
railroad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
owned
by
the
state,
restitute
to
that,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
are
they
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
members
of
the
brotherhood?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
classification
relating
as
to
that.
now,
do
we
know
--
how
do
i
know
what
consideration
has
led
the
alabama
legislature?
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
employees
of
cities
and
counties
as
against
state
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
know
that
cities
or
agencies
of
the
state
as
subject
to
state
constitutional
provisions,
a
state
can
rearrange,
do
anything
it
pleases
with
its
cities.
but
how
do
i
know
there
isn't
a
scope
of
home
rule
that
leads
the
legislature
of
alabama
to
say,
“we
let
birmingham
and
mobile
take
care
of
that,
they
have
ample
power.
i'm
sure
in
the
cities
that
i
know
about,
city
employees
are
differentiated
in
all
sorts
of
way
from
state
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
teachers
they
might
make
a
distinction
again
in
the
case
of
teachers
and
against
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
appear
to
--
with
what
international
union,
the
local
union
who
are
affiliated
in
those
domains?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
rest
on
--
that
may
well
rest
on
different
situation,
namely,
that
they're
part
of
a
railroad
system
with
relationships
with
other
railroad
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
if
a
legislate
--
a
legislature
may
say
that
railroad
employees
whether
on
government-owned
railroads,
or
on
privately-owned
railroads
present
a
different
problem
from
--
from
all
other
employees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
legislation
of
the
commerce
of
united
states
has
taking
note
of
that
fact.
we've
taken
note
of
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
teachers
and
the
city
and
counties
rest
again
on
a
differentiation
of
which
the
legislature
again
be
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
population
of
the
dock
board
employees?
about
what
–-
what
magnitude?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
know
that
that
alabama
also
had
a
state-owned
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
it
wasn't
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
did
you
--
i
think,
did
i
hear
you
say
correctly
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
solomon
act,
was
not
before
your
supreme
court
in
the
--
in
the
decision
that
was
--
in
which
an
--
an
opinion
was
rendered
in
262
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
appears
in
the
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
voice
overlap)
--
that
was
in
the
brief
that
lead
to
the
decision
262
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you're
going
to
the
other
side,
let
me
have
no
doubt
about
what
you're
saying.
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
what
you've
just
said
that
the
others
--
that
the
--
the
present
petitioners
for
the
present
appellants
they
don't
appeal.
but
the
present
appellants
in
the
--
in
the
argument
in
the
proceedings
before
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
alabama
claimed
that
there
were
a
discussion
group
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
solomon
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
--
and
the
alabama's
supreme
court
decided
that
they
were
not
a
discussion
group
merely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that
they
were
brought,
that
their
activities
brought
them
within
the
terms
of
the
solomon
act
and
that's
all
it
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
went
beyond
that.
you
also
said,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
that
the
pleadings
disclosed
that
the
constitutional
--
that
there
was
no
constitutional
attack
on
the
solomon
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
what
--
would
you
mind
stating
what
is
meant,
what
--
what
proper
inferences
may
be
drawn
from
the
judgment
of
the
montgomery
county
decree
saying
the
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
is
denied.
but
what's
the
significance
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
the
prayer,
that's
your
remark
a
little
earlier
that
the
pleadings
did
not
attack
the
constitutionality?
that
covers
i
take
it,
the
terms
of
the
prayer
by
the
complainant
before
the
montgomery
county
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
did
not
say
a
wherefore
(1)
the
act
is
unconstitutional.
wherefore
(2)
proceedings
under
it
or
acts
under
it
should
be
enjoined.
as
far
as,
my
recollection
am
i
wrong
or
right
in
--
in
having
an
impression
that
in
your
state,
you
can,
one
can
get
an
advice
from
somebody.
the
governor
or
the
legislature
you
can
get
an
advice
of
the
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
as
of
the
--
the
governor
in
the
legislature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
by
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
by
statute
or
your
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happens
after
the
alabama
supreme
court
got
through
because
of
what
they
did
in
262.
is
that
automatically
does
that
go
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
or
automatically
that's
just
an
affirmance
of
the
decree
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
you
know
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
montgomery
--
what
you
say
--
to
see
if
this
is
correct,
in
your
--
in
your
point
of
view.
that
the
montgomery
--
the
county
court
of
montgomery
county
or
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
in
effect
had
before
it
a
prayer
for
a
declaration
whether
this
union
or
this
organization
is
within
the
act
period.
they
said
they
were
within
the
act.
so,
therefore,
they
wouldn't
enjoin.
then
went
up
to
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
said
yes,
you're
within
the
act
period.
and
that's
all.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
view,
of
what
took
place
in
the
alabama
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
no
more?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
and
therefore
it
was
within
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
it
--
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
me
to
say
it,
as
i've
now
examined
the
brief
for
both
sides
for
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellant
in
this
case.
they
are
here
and
in
typewritten
form.
and
i
--
on
my
examination
you
are
fully
correct
that
the
issue
that
was
posed
before
the
supreme
court
was
the
issue
of
construction.
and
in
the
--
but
this
qualification
which
i
do
not
think
is
a
qualification
that
the
appellants
here
urged
their
construction
on
the
ground
that
a
different
construction
would
raise
constitutional
questions.
but
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
act
itself
is
constitutional
was
not
as
an
issue
put
before
that
court.
you
say
in
this
present
suit,
an
answer
was
filed
by
the
respondent
and
the
sole
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
complaint
is
the
labor
union
or
other
labor
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act.
and
the
reply
brief
by
the
present
appellant
takes
up
questions
that
were
evidently
put
from
the
bench
in
the
argument
before
your
supreme
court
and
the
reply
brief
does
not
raise
constitutionality
but
raises
the
question
whether
this
is
an
organization
that
comes
within
it
by
virtue
of
its
activities
or
whether
it's
the
debating
or
a
cultural
organization.
i
think
you're
wholly
correct
--
you
are
wholly
correct
in
my
reading
of
the
brief
as
to
the
issue
that
were
put
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
must
the
alabama
supreme
court
decide
constitutionality
on
an
argumentative
implication
that
the
issue
before
federal
district
court
involved
constitutionality
if
they
construe
it
this
way?
can
alabama
supreme
court
--
were
the
tedious
people,
and
there's
a
good
deal
of
respectful
autonomy
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
why
can't
the
alabama
or
the
supreme
court
says
if
you
want
us
to
declare
these
unconstitutional
aspects?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
really
if
you
say
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
or
to
this
the
constitutional
questions
are
avoided
if
you
construe
it
one
way
rather
than
another,
that
isn't
a
necessary
and
automatic
rule
that
it
must
construe
that
way.
that
is
a
proper
consideration
as
this
court
indicated
yesterday.
if
you
please,
an
important
one
in
construction.
but
the
alabama
supreme
court
for
within
its
power,
about
which
we
can
say
nothing,
thought
the
consideration
which
were
urged
to
give
it
one
construction
rather
than
another,
didn't
require
that
construction.
and
it
came
to
an
end.
and
it
--
in
its
determination
with
that.
so,
that
isn't
an
implication
that
it
would
declare
that
the
statute
unconstitutional
if
that
issue
were
pressed
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
both
progress
themselves
with
issues
that
are
pressed
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
occasionally,
rarely
and
not
often
wisely
they
take
matters
to
respondent.
but
on
the
whole
if
one
can
say
we'll
only
adjudicate
the
matter
that's
pressed
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
barred
by
--
i
don't
know
--
i
think
about
it,
needless
to
say.
were
you
barred
by
alabama,
by
local
law
from
asking
the
court
that
if
you
are
honest
you
decide
if
this
court,
you
decide
the
construction
question
against
us
then
0.34
whatever
it
is,
then
we
insist
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
did
you
ever
do
that
in
the
alabama's
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
whether
there's
anything
in
what
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
would
preclude
that
court
today?
an
issue
was
before
it
in
agreeing
to
your
argument
before
this
court
that
the
statute
offends
the
equal
protection
clause
in
its
exception
without
at
all,
even
(inaudible)
to
adhere
to
that
before
that
court,
that
advice
which
you
now
claim
as
a
serious
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
argument
isn't
the
--
isn't
that
--
isn't
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
you
--
you
urge
that
strongly
here.
if
you
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
questioning
that.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
nothing
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
bring
any
(inaudible)
difficulty
in
its
way
of
deciding,
of
saying
that
issue
never
went
before
us.
we
see
its
substantiality,
we
yield
to
it.
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
they're
quite
unrelated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
of
the
statute
might
be
as
constitutional
--
might
be
completely
void
of
any
difficulty
with
the
due
process
clause
and
yet
they
found
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
projecting
the
equal
protection
clause
out
at
just
the
face
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
you
may
not
agree
with
your
--
the
chief
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
says,
we
may
be
more
impressed
by
the
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
it's
a
good
hope
to
be
probable.
