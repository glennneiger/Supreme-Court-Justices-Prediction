mr.
gordon
madison
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
in
a
short
time
that
remains
to
see
if
i
can't
--
to
dispose
of
the
argument
that
relates
to
any
discrimination.
when
this
case
first
went
before
the
district
court
for
the
first
time,
that
court
took
the
position
that
the
act
could
be
construed
in
a
constitutional
manner.
it
said
it
could
have
be
construed
as
the
prohibiting
employees
from
belonging
to
the
union
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
and
then,
it
applied
to
doctrine
of
abstention
which
this
court
later
affirmed.
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
apply
the
doctrine
of
abstention
to
--
to
say
we
are
going
to
abstain
to
let
the
state
court
construe
an
unconstitutional
statute.
i
think
that
is
a
determination
in
a
sense
that
there
is
a
constitutional
way
to
apply
the
statute.
so,
that
seems
to
me
would
get
rid
of
the
argument
relative
to
being
in
any
discrimination
on
faith
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir,
not
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
i'm
satisfied
that
--
that
the
district
court
and
this
court
has
--
has
taken
the
position
that
it
could
be
construed
on
a
constitutional
manner.
they
did
not
raise
the
question
of
constitutionality
in
the
state
court.
mr.
gordon
madison
they
did
not
pass
on
the
constitutionality.
it
was
not
raised
in
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
now,
they'd
probably
like
the
federal
court
bend
it
in
our
state
court
so
that
way
i
can
answer
that
too.
as
pointed
out
here,
from
some
of
the
questions
of
--
from
the
bench,
the
legislative
alabama
--
it
prescribed
the
conditions
of
employment
relative
to
immediate
state
agencies
while
cities,
counties,
school
boards,
the
teachers
there
are
the
most
agencies
of
the
state.
they're
not
to
immediate
agencies.
and
the
legislature
is
leaving
it
to
those
different
localities
to
determine
for
itself
or
themselves
what
they
will
do
if
anything
with
reference
to
public
employees
joined
in
labor
union.
labor
--
labor
conditions
in
certain
parts
of
state
of
alabama
and
in
certain
cities
and
in
certain
areas
may
be
one
thing,
and
in
other
areas,
it
may
be
different.
the
labor
relations
may
be
fine
in
one
area
and
it
may
be
in
certain
respects
if
they
would
say
that
it
would
be
objectionable
to
--
to
cities
and
school
system
or
the
cities
or
the
counties.
and
i
think
legislature
had
a
right
to
--
to
say,
well,
we
will
legislate
this
time,
i
guess
with
reference
to
the
immediate
state
agencies
which
involved
state
employees.
now
--
mr.
gordon
madison
does
the
legislature
have
the
right?
mr.
gordon
madison
i
should
say,
sir,
they'd
have
the
same
right
with
reference
to
them
as
they
would
with
reference
with
the
employees.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
with
reference
to
the
--
the
employees
that
are
--
that
belonged
to
the
--
referred
to
as
being
employees
of
the
state
docks,
section
3
of
the
act,
nor
shall
it
apply
to
the
those
employees
of
the
state
docks
board
referred
to
in
title
38,
section
17,
court
of
alabama
1940.
well,
they
are
the
railroad
workers
and
it
was
thought
that
maybe
the
railway
labor
act
would
have
some
application,
maybe
it
had
preempted
the
field
and
maybe
legislature
couldn't
deal
with
those
employees
so
it
--
it
left
them
out
for
that
reason,
that's
why
i
think
the
legislature
recognizes.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
should
--
my
--
my
idea
would
be
that
they
--
they
left
the
teachers
out
to
enable
the
local
board
of
education
to
determine,
whether
or
not
in
that
judgment,
they
want
to
make
any
provisions
to
refer
that
the
teachers
belonged
with
the
union.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
they
get
in
a
high
educational
system,
the
university
of
alabama.
i
guess
you
might
say
they
get
a
little
closer
to
the
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
can't
direct
you
why,
your
honor,
but
--
as
why
do
they
leave
them
out,
but
i
guess
i
--
i
wouldn't
talk
to
them,
i
would
answer
that
question.
mr.
gordon
madison
you
mean
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
want
to
--
the
only
the
way
that
i
can
answer
that
question
is
that
they
leave
it
to
the
local
unit
to
determine
what
they
want
to
do
with
those
people.
mr.
gordon
madison
because
they
–-
they
gave
me
a
--
mr.
gordon
madison
i
--
i
don't
think
they
did
that.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
may
i
say
your
honor,
it's
improbably
would
be
less
likely
to
march
back
to
force
the
liquor
stores
and
it's
unfair
to
organize
labor,
they
might
not
insist
on
union,
collecting
the
dues
to
check
off
i
might
say.
there
may
be
a
number
of
reasons
that
i
gave
you
as
the
legislation,
i
might
say.
mr.
gordon
madison
thank
you.
mr.
gordon
madison
may
it
please
the
court.
there
isn't
anything
mystic
or
mysterious
about
the
working
to
labor
union.
to
put
it
generally
known
or
how
they
operate
in
order
to
accomplish
there
objectives.
as
to
general,
all
of
them
believe
in
the
principle
of
collective-bargaining
and
they
attempt
to
bring
about
collective-bargaining
agreements.
they
use
strike
in
such
instances.
where
union
and
non-union
members
become
in
daily
contact,
you'll
find
in
sentence
on
paragraph
1
that
should
be
close
shop.
mr.
gordon
madison
that
is
prohibited?
mr.
gordon
madison
insofar
as
i
know
only
there
may
have
been
some
threats.
they
do
deal
sometimes
in
picketing.
then
we
all
know
they
have
designed
that
this
place
to
the
stores,
some
other
places
unfair
to
organized
labor.
they
insist
sometimes
on
the
collection
of
dues.
they
asked
the
employer
to
take
out
the
money
and
remit.
in
their
meeting
they
do
have
political
discussions
about
candidates
which
they
have
a
right
to
do,
to
a
certain
extent.
and
that
they
used
to
keep
both
on
regular
on
(inaudible)
i'm
not
sure,
united
state
senate.
we
have
under
the
merit
system,
political
activity
is
prohibited.
here's
where
the
borderline
will
come
in
these
meetings.
it's
difficult
to
determine.
except
that
they
have
a
right
to
say
one
will
vote
or
against.
you
don't
have
the
right
to
get
into
organization
to
make
speeches
and
go
out
and
engage
in
open
political
activities.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
which
one
all
of
these
things,
that
could
be
provided
for
by
the
state
in
its
wisdom
would
be
for
the
legislature
to
determine.
maybe
some
or
all
of
them
might
constitutionally
be
prohibited
by
stand
of
state
employee.
they
cannot
belong
to
a
union
which
engages
in
these
activities.
certainly,
that's
true
as
to
collective-bargaining.
i
don't
know
all
the
decisions
of
this
court.
you
can't
read
them
all
and
you
can't
keep
up
with
all
them
in
all
the
state
court
decisions.
but
i
believe
this
court
has
said
somewhere
along
the
line
that
collective-bargaining
has
no
place
in
public
employment.
now,
the
district
court
has
said
when
this
case
was
before
it,
contention
was
made
that
this
solomon
act
which
has
been
read
to
you
all
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
well,
if
there
is
any
discrimination
in
this
act
it
appears
on
its
page.
the
district
court
said,
we
don't
say
there's
no
way
to
construe
this
act
in
a
constitutional
manner.
if
it
had
been
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
any
reason,
would
there
have
been
any
logical
reason
for
abstaining
and
sending
the
case
back
to
the
state
court?
wouldn't
if
federal
court
have
proceeded,
is
there
no
way
other
than
to
say
it's
unconstitutional,
would
have
struck
down
right
then.
and
when
it
came
up
here
wouldn't
this
court
have
said,
“no.
we
are
not
going
to
affirm.
there
is
no
possible
way
it
can
be
constitutional.
so,
why
send
it
back?"
this
court
didn't
do
this
--
do
that.
it
affirmed
to
stay
in
the
lower
court.
now,
when
the
union
--
and
i'll
make
this
point
whether
there's
anything
to
it
or
not,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
going
to
mention.
up
to
that
time,
the
--
the
employee
have
seen
and
the
union
have
been
thriving
together.
but
when
they
started
in
the
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
seeking
a
construction
of
this
statute,
the
employee
member
was
dropped
or
he
didn't
participate
in
the
suit.and
the
union
alone
brought
it.
why?
i
don't
know.
the
other
side
may
answer
that
(inaudible)
anyway.
and
then
the
issue
was
formulated
there.
it
seems
like
it
was
studiously
avoided
to
bring
in
any
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
solomon
act.
now,
we
want
you
to
tell
us
by
declaratory
judgment
because
we've
got
a
dispute
between
us,
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
a
labor
union
or
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
said
that
--
yes.
so,
i'll
put
it
this
way.
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
gordon
madison
and
in
the
supreme
court
likewise.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
he
wanted
to
know
whether
not
he
was
a
union
within
the
meaning
of
the
solomon
act.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct,
sir.
and
it
--
mr.
gordon
madison
it
was
raised
neither
in
the
pleadings.
it
was
argued
before
the
supreme
court
on
oral
argument.
the
constitutional
question
was
not
involved.
and
it
appears
in
the
briefs,
i
believe.
now,
those
briefs
were
not
made
a
part
of
this
record.
mr.
gordon
madison
that
if
there's
no
argument,
of
course,
the
constitutional
question
was
argued.
but
each
side
stated,
as
i
recall.
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved
in
this
case.
just
whether
or
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
madison
that
was
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
--
in
this
case.
is
that
correct?
mr.
gordon
madison
i
believe
they
are
in
the
court
record
because
they
were
introduced
in
evidence
on
the
circuit
trial
before
the
district
court.
and
i
think
they
were
left
out
being
printed,
but
i
believe
they
are
here
in
this
court
now.
mr.
gordon
madison
in
the
brief?
mr.
gordon
madison
you
mean
in
the
state
court
brief,
what
was
in
it
or
what
was
left
out?
mr.
gordon
madison
it
was
--
it
was
argued
in
--
in
substance
in
that
case.
mr.
gordon
madison
that
it
was
argued
in
substance.
i'll
state
the
substance
as
nearly
as
i
can
recall
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
by
the
other
side
that
they
had
attempted
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
a.b.c.
board.
at
the
a.b.c.
board
had
refused
to
bargain
with
them
and
hence
they
had
ceased
any
attempt
to
bargain
collectively.
they
then
said
that
we
have
from
that
time
on
conducted
merely
a
discussion
group.
and
being
merely
a
discussion
group,
we
say
that
the
solomon
act
does
not
apply
to
us.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
we
are
a
union
and
our
activities
as
such.
that
we
do
not
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
solomon
act.
we
argued
on
the
other
side.
do
you
want
the
other
side
too,
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
my
understanding
there.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right,
sir.
and
i
want
to
state
that's
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decision.
there
should
be
no
mistake
between
them.
let
me
get
that
clear.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
went
into
the
rules
of
this
organization,
went
into
the
constitution.
it
went
into
the
law
of
mr.
philip
murray
when
it
was
setting
up,
this
organization
all
of
which
provide
for
collective-bargaining
and
it's
in
--
one
of
the
main
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
union.
it
went
into
the
clauses
whereby
the
--
the
member
should
take
an
oath
to
abide
by
those
rules
and
regulations.
that
then
none
of
them
can't
be
changed
without
approval
by
the
executive
committee.
they
went
into
the
question
that
this
union
is
connected
with
the
international
union.
and
in
that
constitution
of
the
international
provided
for
collective-bargaining.
and
that
those
rules
and
regulations
constitute
a
contract
between
a
union
and
the
members
and
between
the
members
themselves.
and
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
a
local
union
merely
on
the
whim
of
a
representative
or
the
local
group
cannot
change
the
declared
purposes
and
objectives
of
that
national
or
international
organization.
and
then
they
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
threw
him
some
moreover
things
about
that
activities,
which
i
will
discuss.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
your
honor
i
will
put
it
this
way
because
it
--
it
maybe
important,
you'll
think.
i
don't
want
misstating
it.
my
recollection
is
that
it
occurs
in
both
briefs.
i
know
it
does
in
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
state.
what
i
know
is
that
we
did
argue
--
argue
the
constitutional
question
for
fear
that
the
court
might
say
this
is
of
such
public
importance
or
something.you
go
ahead
and
deal
with
it
anyhow.
what
we
stated
before
we
did
that,
we
didn't
think
that
question
was
in
and
had
been
raised.
mr.
gordon
madison
in
my
recollection
is
they
did
the
same
thing.
mr.
gordon
madison
but
i'd
rather
rely
on
these
briefs.
they're
here
and
in
order
that
you
may
determine
for
yourself
just
exactly
what
they
did
say.
mr.
gordon
madison
that
--
well,
i
--
it
--
it
doesn't
it
--
i'll
put
it
this
way.
i'll
put
in
the
reverse.
there's
nothing
mentioned
in
the
pleadings
that
the
solomon
act
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
they
asked
that
the
--
the
members
of
the
a.b.c.
board
and
this
manager
of
the
store,
the
supervisor
of
all
to
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
solomon
act.
now,
they
did
that
on
a
theory,
i
guess,
if
they
thought
they
were
not
under
it
and
a.b.c.
board
was
attempting
to
apply
it
to
them,
that
you
ought
to
be
enjoined
from
that.
mr.
gordon
madison
our
recollection
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
governor
can
ask
for
an
advice
or
opinion
and
so
can
members
of
the
legislation
but
nobody
else
can.
mr.
gordon
madison
and
they
don't
have
any
force
or
effect
of
law.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
all
that
i
know
of.
mr.
gordon
madison
though
lots
of
them
will
try
to
get
them
with
the
admonition.
mr.
gordon
madison
i'd
--
i
don't
whether
--
i
don't
recall
whether
it's
constitution
or
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
after
--
after
the
supreme
court
had
gone
into
these
things
that
i
pointed
out,
the
constitution
and
rules
of
the
--
this
organization
and
--
and
make
that
declaration
for
whatever
they
be
aware.
now,
that
case
then
went
back
to
the
district
court
for
the
second
time
that
court
had
let
it
stand
for
a
reasonable
time.
in
order
to
enable
the
appellants
and
i
point
that
isn't
one
of
them
that
makes
(inaudible),
showing
the
remedy,
he
might
have
in
the
state
court.
and
then
insisted
in
that
court,
that
the
district
court
then
pass
on
the
constitutional
issues
which
it
raised
when
it
first
filed
the
suit.
then
the
three-judge
district
court,
we
had
a
hearing
and
argument
up
there.
we
introduced
the
record
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
introduced
the
briefs
on
both
sides.
and
then
judge
graves
who
was
the
presiding
judge
in
that
case
along
with
judge
grooms
and
judge
lynn.
they
stated
that
they
had
given
careful
consideration
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court,
that
is
the
lower
state
court
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
used
the
language,
as
i
recall
that
they
were
clear
to
the
conclusion
that
the
state
courts
had
not
construed
the
solomon
act
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
mr.
gordon
madison
what
do
you
--
you
mean,
your
honor
that
you
might
sort
of
stretch
that
a
little
bit
to
get
it
cover
the
constitutional
question?
mr.
gordon
madison
where
does
that
appears,
sir?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
in
short
i
think
it
means,
your
honor,
that
they've
been
losing
$2
a
month
per
person
in
dues.
and
if
you
construe
this,
actually
it
was
not
to
embrace
them
they'd
be
able
to
have
those
members
participate
for
the
collection
of
dues.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
was
an
affirmance
of
the
decree
below.
mr.
gordon
madison
they
didn't
file
an
application
for
rehearing.
they
didn't
seek
to
have
any
determination
and
the
further
determination
if
one
could
be
had
and
i
don't
whether
it
could
be
if
not
by
this
court
or
what
supreme
court
of
alabama.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
no
more.
mr.
gordon
madison
well
it
did,
your
honor,
but
i
think
what
--
what
i
meant
was
that's
the
same
thing
that
he
asked,
if
--
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
i
don't
get
the
distinction
between
them.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
they
did
not
say
that.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
said
that
you're
not
a
discussion
group.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
right
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
period.
and
they,
they
got
my
period
in
the
wrong
place.
but
i
understand
to
be
in
the
right
place.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
i
do
wish
to
deal
just
briefly
in
conclusion
with
this.
as
i
said,
that
the
courts
have
said,
this
act
could
be
construed
on
a
constitutional
manner.i
think
that
means
something.
i
think
that
take
cares
of
some
their
argument
about
discrimination.
but
as
i
pointed
out,
that
the
labor
relations
in
different
parts
of
the
state
of
alabama,
as
if
the
different
county
government
body,
the
different
city
government
bodies
and
difference
maybe
among
the
teachers
and
the
board
of
education.
it
may
be
necessary
and
desirable
into
some
parts
for
the
local
communities
to
legislate
by
ordinance
of
resolutions
or
by
rule
or
some
other
way.
either
one
way
another
on
these
questions.
now,
yesterday,
mr.
chief
justice
has
been
asking
about
the
higher
institutions
of
learning.
mr.
gordon
madison
over
in
the
university
of
alabama,
are
possibly
our
two
largest.
they
are
governed
by
board
of
trustees.
and
it
--
the
--
it
is
provided
on
their
constitution
that
the
sole
management
and
control
of
those
two
institutions,
shall
vest
in
the
board
of
trustees.
now,
maybe
the
others
are
covered
in
the
exemption
containing
the
statute
or
that's
are
not
covered
by
the
solomon
act,
to
--
to
have
board
of
trustees
or
some
other
civil
board.
they
undoubtedly
have
rule-making
power
just
exactly
like
of
county
board
of
education
or
city
board
of
education.
if
they
adopted
the
rules,
the
question
would
be
as
--
as
i
conceive
it
to
be
whether
not
that
rule
that
they've
adopted
proscribing
public
employment,
of
course,
of
membership
to
the
labor
union
whether
or
not
that
was
a
reasonable
rule.
i
believe
this
court
have
said
that
there
is
constitutional
protection
to
a
public
employee
against
unreasonable
arbitrary
action.now,
with
sum
on
all
of
these
reasons
i
pointed
out
about
the
activities
of
--
of
the
labor
union
they
maybe
entirely
in
order
--
entirely
order
permissible
in
private
employment
but
not
in
public
employment.
mr.
gordon
madison
your
honor
that
their
game
there
maybe
a
dispute.
it's
not
the
purpose
between
counsels.
it
is
my
--
if
my
recollection
of
what
that
act
provides
and
what
our
state
statute
said
that
all
of
them
belong,
because
all
of
them
are
railway
employees.
now,
i
understood
him
to
say
yesterday
that
there
were
some
excluded
who
worked
for
the
docks
that
were
not
railway
employees.
now,
it's
marked
in
the
section
that
that
is
a
mistake
that
i
think
the
one
that
excluded
the
whole
railway
employees.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
refers
to
another
act
in
the
code
and
that
act
said
so.
mr.
gordon
madison
and,
i
think
it
had
the
same
situation
that
refered
to
that
when
it
was
up
here.
they
did
the
same
thing
and
your
court
pointed
that
and
sees
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
gordon
madison
thank
you.
