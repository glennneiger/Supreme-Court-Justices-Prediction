mr.
miller,
what
relief
do
you
want
from
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
you're
right
in
every
--
no
argument,
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
district
court
may
disbelieve
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
disbelieving
the
affidavit,
you
may
reach
the
--
the
conclusion
may
follow,
the
court
of
appeals
follow.
there
isn't
enough
limits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
contrary.
he
may
then
reconsider
he's
line.
and
--
and
be
his
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
the
same
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
admissible
--
although
admissible
under
the
federal
rule
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeal
had
a
right
to
consider
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
it
was
not
admissible.
it
says,
"we
can't
consider
it
because
no
cross-appeal
was
taken."
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
can't
assume
that
they
called
it
was
inadmissible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
merely
went
on
the
ground
of
federal
appellate
procedure,
namely,
it
wasn't
raised
by
appropriate
appeal
and
therefore
we
can't
consider
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
the
analysis
of
justice
harlan,
i
would
agree
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constructive
thrust
in
the
state
law
of
question,
i
suggest
that
the
question
of
admissibility,
a
federal
law
question,
in
any
event,
it
would
--
even
so,
i
wouldn't
disagree
to
it.
assuming
you're
right,
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
federal
--
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
you
would
say
that
even
if
he
had
a
day
that
he's
taking
it
from
the
value,
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
bring
him
to
be
the
constructive
trust
in
the
illinois
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
reach
the
question
that
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
is
--
i
don't
follow
that.
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
with
even
a
capricious
reason
down
the
(inaudible)
doesn't
deny
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
--
he's
saying
you
can't
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
what
the
53.20
court
gave
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
has
tried
to
sustain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
--
on
a
consideration
other
than
that
on
which
the
district
court
sustained
it,
but
in
the
record.
this
is
after
all
a
kind
of
a
--
this
is
a
negligent
proceeding,
isn't
it,
mr.
horsley?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
story.
but
since
this
is
in
equity,
in
fact
is
a
de
novo
consideration
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
--
the
state
said,
"we
don't
think
this
is
admissible,"
there
wouldn't
be
a
proper
case.
but
if
one
--
i'd
like
to
infer
if
one
infers
anything,
that
by
saying
we
can't
consider
it,
that
if
they
didn't
considered,
it
would
have
some
force.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
if
they're
right
that
it
was
excluded
or
they're
right
that
it
should
be
considered
in
order
to
determine
on
the
merits
whether
it
should
be
--
whether
it
had
force,
that
was
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
this
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
to
get
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
arriving
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
say
this
court
too
is
a
court
of
equity
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
we
have
a
right
to
look
at
it
and
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
the
striking
in
--
in
the
district
court
was
not
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
healthy
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
the
justice
--
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
the
question
--
that's
the
point
since
(inaudible)
namely,
is
admissibility
to
be
determined
according
to
illinois
law
or
according
to
federal
--
federal
common
law
evidentiary
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
won't
--
only
the
same
--
only
the
same
the
same
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
federal
rule
on
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
there
are
rules
as
federal
--
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
cover
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
it
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
law,
law
of
evidence
of
the
two
jurisdictions
--
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
if
you're
both
unclean,
the
court
isn't
going
to
favor
the
moving
party
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
take
it,
mr.
horsley,
in
view
of
your
original
remark
in
your
innuendo
references,
i
think
i
ought
to
speak
up
for
ponzi.
when
you
compare
this
case
with
ponzi,
i
think
you're
unfair
to
the
grand
jury's
grandeur
upon
--
and
this
is
critique
stuff
and
therefore
--
