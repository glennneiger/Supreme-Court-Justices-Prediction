mr.
g.
w.
horsley
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly,
we
have
before
us
here
one
of
the
tangents
of
another
ponzi
case,
this
happened
beginning
in
about
1944,
1945,
and
1946.
this
bankrupt
probably
milked
the
public
under
several
million
dollars
in
a
scheme
on
used
cars
whereby
they
deposited
$1000
with
him
and
--
and
he
sold
them
at
less
price,
and
bought
them
at
about
$1500
over
less
price,
and
we
never
could
quite
figure
out
how
he
expected
to
make
a
profit
on
that
operation,
but
he
got
several
million
dollars
and
--
and
deposits
on
cars.
and
on
every
car
that
he
delivered,
he
lost
$1000
to
$1500,
$2000
because
during
this
war
period
right
after
the
war,
he
had
to
pay
off
these
large
sums
of
money
in
order
to
get
cars
to
deliver
to
keep
this
fraud
going.
no
question
but
what
we're
dealing
with
a
man
who
was
a
fraudulent
operator
from
the
very
beginning.
the
claims
in
this
matter
originally
were
over
$8
million
and
we
started
to
untangle
all
of
the
affairs
to
show
you
the
magnitude
of
it,
i
believe
judge
bechtle
asked
the
bankrupt
something
about
some
books
one
time
and
--
wel,l
he
says,
your
honor,
the
money
was
just
coming
in
and
so
fast
that
we
couldn't
keep
track
of
it.
and
as
it
came
in
one
drawer
and
went
out
another,
it
--
it
has
been
a
terrible
headache
to
try
and
unwind.
we
originally
had
two
bankruptcies;
a
corporate
bankrupt
and
an
individual
bankrupt.
those
were
later
consolidated
and
are
now
being
administered
on
the
one
bank
--
bankruptcy
only.
now,
some
of
the
things
that
the
record
show
in
this
case
may
have
a
bearing
upon
this
matter
of
constructive
trust
and
that
is
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
himself
in
this
particular
proceeding.
he
lost
$11,300
in
the
first
fraudulent
operations
of
this
bankrupt.
he
made
deposits
on
tractors
that
he
expected
to
sell
and
make
a
profit
on,
and
so
he
lost
$11,300
when
that
goes
on,
and
he
tried
to
get
that
money
back,
he
hired
attorneys
and
couldn't
get
his
money
back
after
bankruptcy,
and
he
filed
a
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
which
is
still
pending.
now,
this
turnover
order
that
was
issued
by
judge
bechtle
was
based
upon
evidence
that
was
presented
in
open
court,
we
had
an
auditor,
and
judge
bechtle
found
that
he
had
the
sum
of
at
least
$250,000
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control
and
that
he
should
pay
that
sum
of
money
to
his
trustee.
that
order
became
final.
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
order
and
he
never
did
attempt
to
purge
himself
from
contempt.
now,
under
the
holding
of
this
court,
i
realized
we
can't
keep
a
bankrupt
in
jail
forever.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
this
court
held
that
if
a
bankrupt
can
show
that
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
comply
with
a
turnover
order
or
he
can
come
in
and
getting
himself
purged
of
contempt.
this
man
did
not
do
that.
so
therefore,
the
presumption
goes
on
that
he
could
have
complied
with
this
turnover
order
or
else
he
would
have
been
purged
of
contempt
under
the
remedies
of
law
available
to
him.
so,
the
trustee
in
this
case
was
faced
by
an
order
of
court
that
he
was
to
collect
$250,000
from
his
bankrupt.
when
he
didn't
pay,
we
had
him
cited
for
contempt
and
he
was
then
incarcerated.
judge
bechtle
i
think
and
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
in
these
briefs
about
the
duties
of
a
trustee
and
some
implication
about
judge
bechtle
and
about
the
trustee
as
to
whether
rather
they
fulfill
their
duties
properly.
to
me,
the
integrity
of
the
gentleman
involved
in
this
case
is
more
important
than
the
judgment
in
this
case.
because
he
was
trying
to
collect
money
from
this
man
in
order
to
pay
the
creditors
in
this
bankrupt
state.
now,
the
time
and
the
brief's
here,
which
is
limited
and
shows
that
we've
got
$79,000
from
the
bankrupt
although
we
did
get
a
total
of
$170,
000
from
the
bankrupt.
and
there's
no
question
about
what
the
bankrupt
got
a
lot
of
money
from
different
people
after
bankruptcy,
either
borrowed
it
or
they
invested
in
this
corporation
or
some
deal
that
he
had
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
now,
the
petition
in
this
matter
here
--
instantly,
i
might
add
in
connection
about
the
other
that
of
course
why
these
people
put
that
money
in
this
after
bankruptcy
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
and
matter
of
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
it.
well,
i
think,
where
the
big
million
dollar,
multimillion
dollar
operation
like
this
but
everyone
felt
that
this
man
had
money
buried
and
they've
won
the
bankruptcy.
it
was
all
one
round
up,
of
course,
maybe
they
were
investing
in
these
hidden
answers
i
don't
know.
now,
the
petition
in
this
matter
claim
$47,980
from
the
bankrupt.
but
as
$36,000
from
the
trustee
and
the
court
only
allowed
$27,400.
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
this
man
jaffke
testified
and
admitted
that
he
brought
to
bankrupts
wind
up
everyday
or
so
to
see
him
in
jail
or
every
week.
they
were
quite
friendly
and
by
the
way,
the
bankrupt
was
convicted
as
the
records
shows
up
concealing
assets
from
his
trustee
in
february
of
1953,
before
he
died.
so
that,
i
thin
that
adds
more
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
he
had
that
money
under
his
jurisdiction
and
control,
but
naturally,
he
couldn't
walk
into
the
trustee
and
say
here's
$5000
that
i
dug
up
from
(inaudible)
in
the
backyard
because
immediately,
he
would
have
pled
guilty
to
concealment
of
assets.
he
therefore
resorted
to
these
devious
methods
of
making
it
appear
that
other
people
were
paying
the
money
for
him
or
that
he
was
borrowing
money
so
that
he
would
not
plead
guilty
to
the
concealment
of
assents.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that
is
not
quite
--
that
is
not
quite
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
the
record
shows
that
he
was
told
different
stories
by
the
bankrupt
about
corporations
and
about
christmas
tree
deals
and
oil
operations
and
--
and
said
these
monies
were
coming
form
legitimate
business
operation.
i
--
i
believe
that
is
--
isn't
(voice
overlap)
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
on
that,
they
tried
to
ask
the
trustee
about
what
his
connection
were
with
the
fbi
in
his
conversations
and
all
the
things
that
he
did
because
after
all,
we
were
all
cooperating
in
this
concealment
bank.
and
the
judge
sustained
trial
objection
to
what
his
activities
were
over
the
fbi,
so
that
that
is
not
in
the
record
as
to
all
of
the
acts
and
doings
off
the
trustee.
but,
of
course
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
--
this
man,
jaffke
--
and
i
would
like
to
just
get
the
sequence
of
the
events.
in
coming
back
and
forth
in
visiting
with
the
bankrupt
at
the
jail
and
calling
his
wife
and
all,
he
got
this
affidavit
from
the
bankrupt
in
1951.
prior
to
the
time
that
he
filed
his
petition
in
december,
i'm
sorry
it's
1952,
yes
1952.
and
this
was
man
was
tried
for
concealment
of
assets
in
1953,
now,
after
all
of
these
had
happened.
and
this
man,
jaffke,
testified
as
a
witness
in
the
concealment
case
for
the
bankrupt.
he
hold
the
bankrupt
back
and
forth
everyday
on
his
car
from
st.louis
to
springfield
illinois
for
the
trail.
he
did
not
claim
any
witness
fee
for
that.
so,
under
those
suspicious
circumstances,
i
think
we
have
a
bearing
or
not
a
bearing
upon
the
matter
of
constructive
trust.
on
that
trial,
he
testified
that
he
had
loan
the
bankrupt
of
the
sum
of
$47,000.
now,
as
we
go
along
and
he
gave
this
money
to
the
bankrupt,
and
by
the
way,
i
believe,
i
don't
think
mr.
miler
intended
to
state
that
this
corporation
was
fictitious
because
that
is
not
correct.
it
had
a
charter,
it
was
chartered
in
the
state
of
montana,
had
bylaws
in
the
--
the
mr.
jaffke
knew
the
incorporator's
world
of
the
corporation
and
the
record
shows
that
he
specifically
asked
the
bankrupt
why
he
was
not
an
officer
to
corporation
and
the
bankrupt
says
i
can't
be
an
officer
because
of
this
concealment
of
assets,
business
and
the
bankruptcy
that
i
can't
take
any
active
part.
and
yet,
the
evidence
of
jaffke
was
so
conflicting
in
that
connection,
he
first
suddenly
loan
the
money
to
knetzer
then
he
admitted
he
didn't
give
the
money
to
buy
stock
in
the
corporation
but
that
he
invested
the
money
in
a
corporate
deal
as
he
called
it
and
he
was
to
receive
a
share
of
the
profits
along
with
other
men
who
invested
money
in
the
corporate
deal
based
upon
the
percentage
of
the
investments
put
in.
and
yet,
they
introduced
--
accepts
--
they
took
notes
from
the
bankrupt
and
receipts
as
they
went
along
which
were
absolutely
contrary
to
the
oral
testimony
of
jaffke.
the
first
one
recited
that
the
money
was
to
be
repaid
by
jaffke
in
a
matter
of
six
days.
and
when
they
took
one
for
$35,000
from
knetzer
who
signed
a
note
on
december
22nd
1950.
and
at
that
time
on
the
note,
it
said
to
be
accounted
for
by
december
28th
with
interest
of
8%
which
certainly
and
we
objected
during
the
trial
who
allowing
the
oral
testimony
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
written
documents
and
--
and
i
don't
think
it
was
admissible
in
the
first
place
but
the
court
did
allow
those
documents
and
evidence
and
they
absolutely
dispute
the
oral
testimony
of
jaffke.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not
one
word
of
tracing
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
--
in
this
record
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
--
to
the
trustee.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
now,
we
have
set
up
a
chart
in
our
brief.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
up
to
the
time
of
his
death,
a
$170,000
out
of
the
$250,
000.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
there
is
not
one
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no,
sir,
there's
not.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
now
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
sir?
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
generally
--
well,
jaffke
testified
he
paid
the
money
to
knetzer
but
he
testified
he
did
not
know
what
knetzer
did
with
the
money
and
how
much
of
it
went
into
this
court
with
the
operation
but
he
admitted
there
was
a
lot
of
activity,
telephone
calls
and
attorneys
working
on
it
and
trips
to
washington
and
fha
deals
and
all
of
that
and
he
said
he
didn't
know
where
the
man
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
if
you
will
look
on
--
on
our
brief
on
page
41
and
42,
you
will
find
there
we've
set
up
a
chart,
taken
only
from
the
record
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
petitioner
here
has
included
the
document
at
page
192
and
193
of
the
record,
which
is
merely
a
summation
that
he
attached
to
his
answer
to
a
motion
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
which
is
not
taken
from
the
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
if
the
court
will
notice,
jaffke
paid
on
december
7th,
1950,
$6100,
to
knetzer.
and
let
me
point
out
that
on
that
date,
knetzer
told
jaffke
that
he
needed
the
money
to
pay
to
the
trustee
on
the
turnover
order,
so
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
gave
that
money
to
knetzer
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
to
be
used
on
the
turnover
order.
and
i
send
all
the
letter
to
all
of
the
creditors
in
which
i
set
forth
all
about
this
bankruptcy,
about
the
turnover
order,
the
fact
that
he
had
not
paid
anything
on
the
turnover
order
and
we
were
going
to
send
him
to
jail
and
the
petitioner
admitted
that
he
got
one
of
those
letters.
he
knew
about
the
turnover
order
he
was
well
apprised
of
all
of
that
situation.
now,
the
only
difference
in
the
evidence,
he
says,
he
only
gave
him
$3800
of
that
$6100
to
apply
on
the
turnover
order,
and
the
rest
was
on
the
corporate
deal.
but
on
cross
examination,
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
taken
his
deposition
and
he
admitted
that
the
$6100
was
on
the
turnover
order.
and
he
further
on
admitted
on
cross
examination
that
that
money
was
to
be
repaid
to
him
in
a
few
days
by
another
individual.
now,
that
certainly
is
inconsistent
with
his
theory
of
any
corporate
deal
because
at
the
time
i
took
his
deposition,
he
admitted
he
expected
to
get
that
money
back
within
a
few
days
from
another
individual.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out,
on
page
41,
december
7th,
13th,
18th,
21
and
january
3rd,
the
total
amount
of
money
that
was
paid
in.
now,
if
you
will
look
on
the
next
page
at
page
42,
you
will
find
that
during
the
period
of
december
8th
through
december
22nd,
the
bankrupt
paid
to
the
trustee
only
the
sum
of
$10,000.
and
during
the
months
of
january,
february
and
march
after
having
received
this
money
from
jaffke,
the
bankrupt
paid
nothing
to
the
trustee.
but
beginning
on
april
9th,
1951,
he
started
paying
further
payments
which
more
or
less
ties
up
with
the
next
column
on
page
41
where
a
fellow
with
the
name
of
petty
was
furnishing
some
money
purportedly
to
the
bankrupt.
now,
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
said
that
of
the
total
amount
paid
out
of
$225,000
which
the
bankrupt
got
from
these
individuals,
the
trustee
only
got
$79,000,
of
which
is
$145,000
not
accounted
for.
now,
whose
money
was
it?
and
the
court
wound
up
by
saying
that
there
was
no
tracing
whatsoever,
there
was
no
--
that
it
could
be
determined
where
the
money
came
from.
now,
my
position
is
this,
and
i
want
to
be
frank
in
stating
it,
i
--
i
don't
find
any
cases
in
the
books
on
all
course
with
this
situation.
we
find
cases
on
--
on
constructive
trust,
on
tracing
and
so
on
but
we
find
absolutely
no
case
where
a
trustee
is
faced
with
the
matter
of
turnover
order
and
then
having
these
moneys
paid.
as
we
turned
over
the
principle
that
under
illinois
law,
in
order
to
have
a
constructive
trust,
there
must
be
fraud
proven.
there
must
be
certain
elements
such
as
falsity
of
statements
and
reliance
upon
those
and
then
added
to
that,
that
demand
acts
in
good
faith,
the
person
who
is
giving
the
money.
by
my
drawing
analogy,
i
would
say
that
if
the
bankrupt
had
gone
to
some
widow
woman
and
said
give
me
$5000
and
i'll
go
down
and
buy
you
some
general
motor
stock
with
it
and
he
instead
took
that
money
and
paid
it
to
the
trustee
and
it
could
be
proven
that
he
paid
that
that
money
to
the
trustee
that
would
be
a
constructive
trust
and
we
would
have
to
give
that
money
back
for
that
woman.
because
at
first,
there
is
fraud,
there
is
the
circumstances
under
illinois
law
which
raised
a
constructive
trust
and
when
we
get
the
money
that's
impressed
with
it.
but
in
these
circumstances
here
with
a
man
knowing
that
he
has
dealing
with
a
fraudulent
operator
to
begin
with,
knowing
that
he
was
under
an
order
to
turn
the
money
over
to
the
court,
he
must
have
utter
assurance
that
that
money
would
be
forthcoming
some
back
to
him.
because
he
so
testified
that
he
could
withdraw
his
money
from
knetzer
and
demand
it
back
any
day
which
is
contrary
to
his
theory
of
investing
it
in
a
corporate
deal.
and
he
said
that's
why
it
was
put
on
those
notes
that
it
was
to
be
repaid
within
six
or
eight
day
--
days
so
that
he
could
always
put
his
finger
on
it
and
call
it
back.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no,
sir,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that's
my
position.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i'm
coming
to
that
just
one
moment.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
our
--
on
the
facts,
my
--
and
my
time
won't
permit
me
to
go
more
into
them
but
my
brief
has
in
my
--
i
think
very,
fully
covered
in
the
brief.
on
this
question
of
cross-appeal,
i've
cited
no
case
different
from
those
cited
by
the
petitioner
because
i
think
there
--
there
are
cases
correctly
state
the
law
on
this
matter
of
cross-appeal.
i
think
the
rule
very
simply
is
that
if
to
enlarge
the
rights
of
the
appellee,
and
that
if
the
rights
of
the
appellee
are
enlarged
by
what
he
seeks
to
urge
on
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
cannot
consider
it
without
a
cross-appeal.
now,
here
we
have
a
situation
where
an
affidavit
says
36,000
yet
the
trial
court
only
gave
him
27,400.
if
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
the
affidavit
is
admissible,
they
would
have
to
enlarge
their
judgment
to
$36,000.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
he's
compromising
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
he's
compromising.
he's
saying
"i'm
happy
with
the
$27,400.
if
you'll
just
give
me
that,
i
will
go
home."
but
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
it
is
an
equity
that's
why
he
must
have
clean
hands
when
he
comes
in
to
this
equitable
court.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
--
of
course
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i
--
i
think
on
this
matter
of
cross-appeal
that
we
put
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
--
too
much
emphasis
on
it
because
the
affidavit
definitely
is
not
admissible,
under
the
illinois
law.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
it
is.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i
think
so.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i
think
so.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i
might
add
the
trial
court
was
a
sick
man
and
this
judgment
was
entered
up
about
six
months
or
so
after
the
case
was
heard
and
then
he
later
died.
and
of
course
--
so
the
trial
judge
who
originally
heard
it
is
now
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
--
deceased.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
i
wouldn't
dare
to
say
otherwise.
[laughter]
i
--
i
can
assure
you
that.
i
--
i
liked
them
all
and
i
wouldn't
say
any
other
--
they're
not
healthy.
i
--
but
under
the
illinois
law,
this
affidavit
definitely
is
not
admissible.
now,
the
petitioner
here
is
trying
to
make
a
distinction.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
sir?
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
which
to
be
determined
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
it
has
to
be
determined
under
the
law
which
will
allow
the
admissibility
under
the
federal
rule,
and
the
federal
law
on
this,
the
case
law.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
federal
rule.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
it
merely
says.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
it
merely
says
that
that
law
favoring
admissibility
will
be
adopted.
in
other
words,
if
there
are
federal
cases
favoring
the
admissibility,
they
will
have
proceedings
over
the
state
law.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
or
vice-versa,
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
they
are
identical.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that
it's
not
admissible.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
because
it's
an
ex
parte
affidavit
given
by
a
bankrupt
after
having
passed
with
a
title
and
therefore
is
not
admissible.
this
court
had
occasion
to
--
to
rule
on
that
matter
in
the
chain
alliance
case.
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
rule
on
--
rule
on
it
in
macgyver
and
mckenzie
and
the
columbia
casualty
case.
in
the
columbia
casualty
case,
a
truck
driver
who
gave
an
affidavit,
which
would
absolve
the
insurer
of
liability
even
though
he
had
to
make
him
liable
for
the
judgment
and
the
insurer
would
not
be
liable
and
they
introduced
that,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
admissible.
an
ex
parte
affidavit
--
and
the
court
goes
into
the
reasons
for
it.
and
it
says
that
affidavit
--
ex
parte
affidavits
are
so
easily
obtainable
under
such
circumstances
that
fraud
could
easily
be
connected
with
it.
well,
now
here
is
a
man
who
gave
some
money
to
a
bankrupt
along
in
1950.
he
comes
along
in
1952.
when
a
man
is
in
jail
waiting
to
be
tried
for
concealment
of
assets
under
circumstances
that
he's
going
to
be
a
witness
for
that
man
at
that
trial
and
obtains
an
affidavit
from
him
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
i
presume
you
want
a
frank
answer
to
that.
i
think
they
were
waiting
for
us
to
try
to
get
our
$250,000
hoping
that
he
would
tip
his
hands
during
that
time.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
oh,
yes.
we
knew
what
type
of
person
he
was.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
oh,
he
told
us
a
lot
of
wild
stories
that
we're
checked
down
by
the
fbi
and
were
not
true.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
your
honor,
everytime
that
he
came
before
judge
bechtle
and
wanted
a
--
an
extension
of
time
or
wanted
out,
he
assured
the
court
that
he
could
comply
for
the
turnover
order.
he
did
that
on
the
last
time.
now,
here
is
--
and
we
ran
a
peculiar
position.
here
is
exhibit
29
which
was
not
admitted
by
the
court
and
was
struck,
but
which
is
a
--
a
hearing,
an
ex
parte
hearing
when
this
man
wanted
out
to
go
get
some
--
the
money
to
pay
and
he
assured
the
court
that
it
would
be
money
that
was
not
in
any
way
fraudulently
obtained,
but
would
be
turned
over
and
of
course,
there
was
never
any
money
paid
after
that
time,
but
the
length
of
time,
i
--
i
frankly
think
was
all
tied
up
in
getting
evidence
and
hoping
this
man
would
tip
his
hand
to
where
he
had
assets
buried.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
you
mean
that
were
buried?
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no.
even
though
he
was
found
guilty
of
concealing
them,
the
actual
assets
were
never
found
that
were
buried.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
yes,
but
they
all
had
larceny
in
their
heart
because
they
were
going
to
share
on
the
hidden
assets
when
they
could
be
recovered.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
your
honor,
that
evidence
is
only
referred
to
directly
in
an
exhibit
here
that
i
don't
think
is
admissible
and
i
have
to
go
outside
the
record
if
i
--
if
i
proceed
on
that.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
i
think
we
have
both
got
outside
the
record
quite
a
bit.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
your
honor,
we
had
no
knowledge
that
he
was
cheating
more
people.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
we
knew
that.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
we
knew
that.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
no,
no,
that
is
not
correct.
that,
sir,
is
not
correct,
that
we
hope
that
we
could
recover
money
and
we
would
not
want
money
that
he
had
earned
after
bankruptcy.
the
court
found
he
had
$250,000
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control.
now,
if
he
substituted
other
money
for
that
money,
i
think
under
equitable
principles,
we'd
be
entitled
to
that
money.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
i
--
i
would
not
say
this
trustee
was
unclean.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
but
if
they
were,
yes,
the
--
being
in
equity
would
not
be
any
recovery.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
i
--
that
may
be
true.
one
other
thing
with
reference
to
these
charts
in
here
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
you
mean
the
first
time?
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
i'll
tell
you.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
first
a
two-to-one
opinion
here
and
--
and
they
reversed
and
remanded
with
further
proceedings
not
in
consistent
with
this
opinion.
and
frankly,
nobody
could
tell
what
they
meant
by
it.
so,
for
that
reason
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
they
entered
judgment.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that's
right.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
well,
he
had
his
day
in
the
court.i
mean
everybody
present
him
all
the
evidence
that
--
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
that's
right.
mr.
g.
w.
horsley
but
we
think
the
affidavit
was
not
admissible
and
so
that
leaves
them
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
other
--
there
weren't
affidavits
at
all.
