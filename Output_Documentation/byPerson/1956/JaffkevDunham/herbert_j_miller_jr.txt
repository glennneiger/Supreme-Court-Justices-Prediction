mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
petition
for
reclamation
filed
by
one,
jaffke,
who
is
the
petitioner
here,
against
william
dunham,
who
was
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
the
estate
of
robert
knetzer,
who
has
since
died.
the
two
principal
issues
in
this
case
are,
first,
a
question
of
appellate
procedure.
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
pass
on
questions
urged
by
the
appellee,
the
petitioner
here,
who
was
victorious
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
absence
of
a
cross-appeal.
the
second
principal
issue,
presented
by
this
case,
is
whether
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
the
responded
here,
had
a
duty
to
investigate
the
source
of
payments
made
to
him.
under
a
turnover
order,
these
payments
being
made
on
--
and
the
time
period
running
up
to
three
and
half
years
after
the
bankrupt
was
adjudicated
at
such.
the
bankrupt
in
this
case,
robert
knetzer,
had,
prior
to
1948,
engaged
in
a
fraudulent
scheme
of
defrauding
people
of
money
which
they
had
deposited
on
automobile.
in
1948,
he
was
adjudged
a
bankrupt.
in
july
of
1949,
approximately
nine
months
after
his
adjudication,
the
respondent
trustee
filed
a
petition
asking
the
bankruptcy
court
to
enter
a
turnover
order.
this,
the
court
did
in
july
of
1949.
compliance
with
the
turnover
order,
not
being
forthcoming,
the
bankrupt
was
the
adjudged
in
contempt
of
court
on
december
1st,
1949,
and
it
was
sentenced
to
be
incarcerated
as
a
civil
contempt
order.
this
was
stayed
--
the
sentence
to
jail
was
paid,
however,
until
march
of
1950.
subsequent
at
this
date,
he
was
placed
in
jail.
however,
subsequent
to
march
of
1950,
on
many
occasions,
the
bankrupt
was
release
from
custody,
ostensibly
to
obtain
assets
with
which
to
comply
with
the
turnover
order
which
required
him
to
pay
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
the
sum
of
$250,000.
while
on
these
excursions
from
custody,
the
bankrupt
contacted
jaffke,
the
petitioner
here.
and
by
reasons
of
certain
fraudulent
representation
to
him,
concerning
a
large
scale
building
development
which
was
to
be
run
by
the
bison
corporation,
a
fictitious
organization,
knetzer
defrauded
jaffke
of
the
sum
of
$47,000.
this
occurred
in
a
period
commencing
in
december
of
1950,
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
entry
of
the
turnover
order
and
payments
were
made
by
jaffke
to
knetzer
through
october
of
1951.
after
this
money
had
been
obtained
from
jaffke,
he
subsequently
discovered
that
he
had
been
the
defrauded.
and
he
approached
the
bankrupt
and
attempted
to
ascertain
what
had
become
of
his
asset.
pursuant
to
this
conversation,
the
bankrupt
executed
an
affidavit,
which
in
effect
states,
that
he
had
borrowed
$47,000
from
jaffke
and
that
he
had
paid
$36,000
of
jaffke's
money
over
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
subsequently,
jaffke
filed
his
petition
for
reclamation
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
he
named
as
the
defendant,
the
bankrupt,
robert
knetzer,
suing
him
for
$47,000
and
he
also
named
as
the
defendant
trustee
of
knetzer's
estate.
well,
prior
to
trial,
however,
knetzer
died
and
the
case
proceeded
with
only
the
respondent
trustee
as
the
defendant
in
the
case.
at
the
trial,
it
appeared
that
the
--
the
fraudulent
representations
of
the
bankrupt
to
jaffke
was
set
out
in
full,
and
demonstrated
that
jaffke
had
gone
out
on
the
basis
of
these
representations
and
had
borrowed
money
from
other
people
which
he
subsequently
repaid
in
order
to
invest
in
this
scheme.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
--
knetzer
had
committed
a
fraud
on
jaffke
and
the
appellate
court
affirmed
that
finding
of
fraud.
therefore,
i
shall
not
detail
all
of
those
facts
here.
at
the
trial,
it
appeared,
further,
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had,
on
several
occasions,
been
approached
by
knetzer
while
he
was
a
civil
contemnor
at
a
time
from
one
to
two
years
subsequent
to
the
time
when
he
had
been
adjudged
to
--
a
civil
contemnor
for
failure
to
comply
with
his
turnover
order.
and
pursuant
to
knetzer's
request,
the
trustee
would
call
his
attorney
or
would
call
the
bankruptcy
judge
who
sentenced
knetzer
to
jail
and
would
ask
that
knetzer
have
additional
time
free
from
incarceration.
this
was
done
on
representations
by
knetzer
to
his
trustee
in
bankruptcy
that
he
would
obtain
additional
assets
so
as
to
comply
with
the
turnover
order.
now,
the
evidence
also
discloses
that
there
were
small
payments
running
over
a
period,
starting
in
approximately
september
of
1950
and
continuing
on
until
february
of
1952.
these
payments
ran
from
$1000,
$5000
or
$10,000
bargain.
and
at
no
time
did
the
trustee
have
any
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
these
payments
constituted
to
conceal
assets
of
the
bankrupt's
estate,
he
so
testified.
he
further
testified
that
at
no
time
did
he
make
any
inquiry
of
the
bankrupt
as
to
where
these
assets
had
been
obtained,
and
this
was
true,
even
though
the
payments
were
made
in
1950,
1951,
and
1952,
the
bankrupt
had
been
adjudicated
as
such
in
1948
and
the
--
the
turnover
order
or
$250,000
had
been
entered
in
the
middle
of
1949.
it
further
appeared,
in
addition
to
this,
that
third
parties
had
come
in
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
and
said,
i
will
be
responsible
or
so
much
a
week,
in
once
instance,
i
will
be
responsible
for
$1000
a
day
under
knetzer's
turnover
order.
now,
a
desired
position
here,
of
course,
that
all
of
these
facts
taken
together
placed
the
trustee
on
notice
and
required
him
to
inquire
as
to
where
knetzer
was
obtaining
these
funds.
the
trial
court
found
for
petitioner,
jaffke,
the
petitioner
here,
entered
a
judgment
in
a
sum
of
$27,400.
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
jaffke
had
been
defrauded
by
knetzer,
it
specifically
found
that
$27,400
of
jaffke's
money
had
been
paid
in
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
in
purported
compliance
with
his
turnover
order
and
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
no
right
to
these
assets
because
they
were
after
acquired
property
and
were
in
fact
the
property
of
jaffke.
the
court
also
found
that
the
equities
of
the
case
were
with
the
petitioner
jaffke.
however,
at
the
trial,
there
was
admitted
in
the
evidence
the
affidavit
signed
by
the
bankrupt
admitting
that
he
had
turned
$36,000
of
jaffke's
money
over
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
buy
further
freedom
from
jail
so
that
he
could
make
installment
payments
to
the
trustee
and
gain
a
little
more
time
out
of
jail.
while
this
affidavit
was
admitted
at
the
trial,
nevertheless,
the
trial
court,
after
finding
for
petitioner,
struck
the
affidavit
from
evidence,
no
reason
was
given
for
this.
the
respondent
trustee
appealed
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
his
main
point
before
that
court
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
jaffke's
money
had
in
fact
been
turned
over
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
several
other
points
raised
by
the
appellant's
trustee
in
bankruptcy
and
then
stated,
but
because
no
cross-appeal
has
been
filed
by
the
appellee,
jaffke,
in
this
case,
we
cannot
consider
the
evidence
which
was
stricken
by
the
trial
court,
namely,
this
affidavit,
and
consequently,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
that
knetzer
did
in
fact
turned
jaffke's
money
over
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
again
that
knetzer
had
died
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
consequently,
the
court
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
instead
of
remanding
the
case
for
further
proceedings,
entered
judgment
for
the
appellant,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
now,
there
is
no
question,
i
think,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
under
the
decisions
of
other
courts
that
the
appellee
in
--
in
an
appellate
tribunal
has
the
right
to
urge
in
support
of
his
judgment
in
the
district
court,
any
matter
that
was
urged
in
the
trial
court,
the
cases
are
clear
on
that.
in
fact,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
trustee,
the
respondent
here
has
urged
before
this
court
an
argument
which
it
made
to
the
appellate
court
but
it
did
not
file
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari.i
ndeed,
it
would
not
have
standing
to
do
so.
he
was
a
victorious
party
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
petitioner
here,
jaffke,
could
not
have
filed
a
cross-appeal.
he
was
the
victorious
party.
he
had
a
judgment
in
his
favor.
the
findings
of
fact
were
all
in
his
favor.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
difference
in
that
that,
your
honor,
is
this,
$3800
--
when
knetzer
first
approached
jaffke
in
december
of
1950,
he
specifically
told
jaffke
that
$3800
of
this
money
had
to
be
paid
into
court
or
would
be
paid
into
court
under
the
provisions
of
a
turnover
order
which
he,
and
knetzer
had
signed
under
duress.
on
the
second
$4800
with
the
last
payments
that
knetzer
had
given
to
jaffke
when
jaffke
finally
getting
suspicious,
demanded
an
automobile
as
a
mortgage
or
as
a
channel
mortgage
to
secure
that
payment
and
that
was
subsequently
repaid
to
jaffke
in
this
case
by
--
by
relevant
of
knetzer.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
the
--
the
full
amount
claimed
from
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
was
$36,000.
we
obtained
a
judgment
for
$27,400.
now,
to
be
sure,
we
could
have
appealed
from
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
award
us
the
full
amount
claim.
however,
in
the
past
year
that
the
case
was,
we
really,
in
effect,
were
not
agreeing
by
the
one
part
of
the
trial
court's
order
which
we
wanted
to
appeal
from
but
couldn't,
i.e.,
describing
of
a
--
of
a
document
from
evidence.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
are
satisfied
that
that
judgment
is
proper.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
would
like
to
say
again,
the
finding
of
fact
and
the
trial
courts
were
all
in
our
favor.
he
found
that
$27,400
of
the
petitioner's
money
here.
definitely,
his
money
was
turned
over
by
the
--
by
knetzer
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
that
was
specifically
found
by
the
trial
court
and
consequently
he
awarded
us
the
judgment
for
$27,400.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
none
your
honor.
it
merely
stated
as
i
may
quote
the
language,
it's
on
page
183
of
the
record.
this
affidavit
was
apparently
received
an
evidence
over
objection
of
counsel
for
the
trustee
but
at
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
trial
judge
sustained
the
objection
and
the
trustee's
motion
described
knetzer's
affidavit
from
the
record.
there
was
no
cross-appeal
by
the
petitioner
to
question
this
action
by
the
trial
court,
and
this
court
may
not
consider
knetzer's
affidavit
as
evidence
in
this
case.
consequently,
there
was
no
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
admissibility
of
that
affidavit.
the
affidavit,
however,
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
your
honor
--
no
sir,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
the
affidavit
is
clearly
admissible.
now,
the
difficulty
with
the
affidavit
is
because
it's
an
affidavit.
if
it
were
an
oral
statement
by
the
bankrupt,
knetzer,
or
if
it
were
a
letter,
a
written
statement,
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
any
difficulty
in
finding
that
it
was
a
declaration
against
interest,
but
it
is
an
affidavit.
therefore,
the
initial
reaction
is
well,
i
--
i
learned
in
law
school
that
affidavits
are
no
good.
so
if
we
can
ignore
the
fact
that
this
is
a
--
an
affidavit,
although,
really
it
is
stronger
than
an
oral
statement
or
a
written
statement
because
it
was
signed
under
oath
and
at
the
time
knetzer
signed
it,
there
was
an
attorney
with
him
who
said
you
cannot
sign
that
unless
it
is
true.
but,
in
the
affidavit,
knetzer
does
three
things.
first
of
all,
he
admits
that
he
owes
knetzer
--
jaffke
$47,000.
now,
that
certainly
is
a
declaration
against
pecuniary
interest.
the
second
thing
he
does,
he
admits
that
he
turned
$36,000
of
petitioner's
money
over
to
the
trustee
in
order
to
buy
freedom
from
imprisonment
as
he
said.
now,
that
is
also
a
declaration
against
interest
because
it
demonstrates
that
he
acted
fraudulently
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
jaffke
in
this
case
because
jaffke
didn't
give
him
$36,000
to
pay
over
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
he
gave
him
$36,000
to
be
used
in
the
development
of
a
housing
transaction.
but,
even
more
important
on
this
--
on
this
declaration
against
interest
point
is
that
knetzer,
by
admitting
the
$36,000
of
jaffke's
money
had
been
paid
over
to
trustee
was
in
effect
wiping
out
$36,000
of
the
amount
that
he,
jaffke,
that
--
that
he,
knetzer,
had
paid
in
under
the
turnover
order.
consequently,
if
you
took
that
$36,000
away,
then
his
only
prospect
was
further
imprisonment
as
a
civil
contemnor
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
turnover
order.
consequently,
i
--
i
can't
see
any
basis
for
excluding
this
declaration
against
interest.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
affidavit
--
the
record
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
affidavit
was
executed
in
august
of
1953
approximately
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
1952
--
1952,
thank
you.
jaffke
had
gone
to
knetzer
and
obtained
an
attempt
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
his
money.
based
on
what
knetzer,
the
bankrupt
told
him,
jaffke
prepared
this
affidavit.
he
took
that
affidavit
and
he
took
it
down
to
jail
where
at
this
particular
time
knetzer
was
again
incarcerated.
he's
been
in
and
out,
in
and
out.
in
this
particular
time,
he
was
in
jail.he
handed
this
affidavit
to
one,
hymes,,
an
attorney
at
law,
who
was
talking
to
knetzer
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
would
represent
him.
knetzer
turned
to
hymes
and
said,
"well,
do
i
--
should
i
sign
this
or
not?"
hymes
said,
"if
it
is
true,
you
can
sign
it
but
don't
sign
it
unless
it
is
true."
consequently,
a
lieutenant
of
the
police
force
who
was
a
notary
public
was
called
in,
came
in
and
swore
jaffke
to
the
truth
of
it
notarized
his
signature
on
this
affidavit.
that
was
the
circumstances
around
this
problem.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
in
august
of
1952.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
oh,
and
he
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
died
prior
--
this
suit
was
instituted
in
1950,
in
december
of
1952,
knetzer
--
or
1953,
knetzer
died
in
august
in
1953.
in
other
words,
approximately,
six
months
prior
--
no,
no,
six
months
subsequent
to
this
suit.
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
died
after
this
suit
was
started.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
was
dead
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes
--
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
trial
court
so
held
and
the
court
of
appeals,
so
held.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
jaffke
testified
at
the
hearing
concerning
the
fraud.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
--
he
--
yes,
sir.
he
testified
that
he
had
prepared
the
affidavit,
that
he
took
it
to
the
attorney
hymes.
then
of
course,
he
could
testify
no
more.
attorney
hymes
testified
that
he
had
taken
the
affidavit
and
shown
it
to
knetzer
and
then
the
--
we
had
the
police
officer,
who
is
a
notary
public,
testified
that
he
had
notarized
knetzer's
signature.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
because
he
was
not
present
when
the
--
when
the
affidavit
was
executed.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir,
he
did.
and
that's
how
he
knew
how
to
prepare
the
affidavit.
jaffke
learned
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
he
--
he
could
have,
your
honor.
and
he
was
asked
that
specific
question,
but
the
trial
court
refused
to
let
him
answer.
he
sustained
an
objection
by
counsel
for
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
on
the
ground
that
it
was
hearsay.
and
of
course
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
was,
but
he
was
dead.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
the
--
in
the
proceeding
before
the
trial
court,
but
he
died
prior
to
the
time
of
trial
commenced.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
--
i
have
my
--
my
own
thoughts
on
that
but
what
i
believed
happen,
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
meant
to
rule
that
this
affidavit
was
admissible
and
made
a
mistake
in
striking
it
but
that's
probably
not
the
case,
or
may
be
the
case
may
not,
that's
supposition.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
is
evidence
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
other
evidence
is
this,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
evidence
which
is
in
the
record
that
the
affidavit
was
prepared
by
jaffke
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
oh,
ignore
the
affidavit.
the
first
--
the
--
the
--
well,
aside
from
that,
there
is
a
testimony
of
--
of
hymes
and
that
is,
it
all
ties
in
with
the
affidavit,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
hymes,
the
attorney,
who
said,
"you
cannot
sign
this
affidavit
unless
it's
true,"
and
the
fact
of
signing,
we
contend,
is
--
is
evidence
in
the
record.
but
it
was
true
even
though
the
physical
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
didn't
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
only
other
evidence,
your
honor,
is
this,
that
other
people
were
defrauded.
one
riley
who
was
defrauded
in
the
period
of
may
1950
to
june
1950.
he
paid
$33,000
to
knetzer.
during
the
same
period,
the
$32,000
was
paid
in
under
the-
-
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
on
this
turnover
order.
the
next
period,
from
december
of
1950
until
october
of
1951,
the
trustee
received
approximately
$75,000
under
this
turnover
order.
one,
petty,
paid
knetzer
$44,000
in
the
same
period.
and
you
subtract
petty's
money
from
the
amount
that
--
that
jaffke
paid
in
to
knetzer
and
there
you
have
it
sitting
very
prettily
the
fact
that
that
money
did
in
fact
come
from
jaffke.
the
--
the
period
of
the
payment
show
it
very
clearly.
and
then
subsequent
to
that
date,
one,
sammons
would
have
testified
had
he
been
at
the
trail
and
was
stipulated
that
from
november,
and
i
emphasize
from
november
1st,
1951,
to
february
of
1952,
that
he
had
paid
$102,000
to
knetzer,
again,
on
one
of
his
fraudulent
experience.
now,
the
only
--
the
court
--
that
was
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
where
the
court
of
appeals
erred
because
they
included
in
this
period,
sammons,
$102,000
when
it
clearly
appears
and
the
counsel
here
i
believe
has
admitted
it
because
on
page
4
of
this
brief,
he
said
that
the
period
run
from
november
of
1952
through
--
november
of
1951
through
december
of
1952
for
sammons'
money.
and
that
is
beyond
the
period
herein
question.so
consequently,
we
contend
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
that
money
must
have
come
form
jaffke.
there
was
no
other
source
--
possible
source
shown
for
that
money.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
you're
honor,
the
relief
we
seek
before
this
court
is
an
affirmance
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
because
there
--
can
be
nothing
further
gained
by
any
further
proceedings
in
any
other
tribunal.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
but
--
that
is
true,
your
honor,
it
may
disbelieve
the
affidavit.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
--
that
may
be
true.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
trial
judge
who's
--
who
tried
this
case
specifically
stated
during
the
--
at
the
close
of
the
trial."
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
the
money
being
paid
in."
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
is
possible.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
either
a
question
of
illinois
law
or
a
question
of
federal
law,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes.
[laughs]
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
this,
your
honor,
that
under
the
federal
rule,
if
the
evidence
is
admissible,
i
mean
that
you
have
two
--
two
grounds
for
admissibility,
either
under
federal
law
or
under
state
law
and
whichever
rule
favors
admissibility
will
be
the
rule
under
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
which
will
be
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
oh,
it's
in
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
can
assume
--
i
--
i
can't
assume
anything
because
the
only
thing
i
can
assume
is
what
they
said
that
no
cross-appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
in
answer
to
that
question
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
in
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
the
--
all
of
the
--
the
evidence
of
the
party
is
--
is
all
before
this
court,
and
i
--
perhaps,
this
is
not
an
answer
but
i
like
to
point
out
this
one
extenuating
circumstances,
bankruptcy
has
been
going
on
now
since
1948.
and
while
this
may
not
be
a
reason
why
this
court
should
pass
on
the
issue,
i've
merely
pointed
out
that
the
time
has
come
to
close
the
proceedings
and
i
believe
mr.
horsley
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
frankly
necessary,
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
--
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
this,
that
there
is
everything
in
the
record
here.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
trial
court
cannot
be
affirmed.
the
affidavit
is
before
this
court,
the
--
all
the
testimony
is
before
this
court.
and
to
me,
the
--
the
proper
basis
would
be
to
affirm,
and
i
--
another
fact
for
consideration
that
may
be
i
shouldn't
bring
up
is
the
fact
that
petitioner
in
this
case
is
--
well,
i
won't
settle
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
i
would
be
satisfied
it
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
be
even
more
satisfied
your
honor
that
this
court
will
affirm
the
trial
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
the
cases
that
we've
pointed
out
to
say
that
if
there,
the
appellee
has
agreed
in
any
way
by
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
that
he
cannot
urge
matters
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
enlarge
his
rights.
