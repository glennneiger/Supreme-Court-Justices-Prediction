justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
--
did
you
say
--
did
you
say
that
you
agreed
that
without
the
affidavit,
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
trial
--
the
$27,000
whatever
his
judgment
were.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
ground
was
given
for
that
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
knetzer
was
a
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
knetzer
was
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what's
the
evidence
upon
which
the
trial
court
finally
relied
for
the
finding
that
jaffke's
money
had
been
turned
over
to
knetzer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
at
it
â€“
let
me
get
at
it
another
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beside
from
the
affidavit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
see
--
you've
already
told
us
that
jaffke
was
not
allowed
to
say
that
knezer
told
him
he
turned
the
money
over
to
the
trustee.
what
other
evidence
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
hymes
turned
it
over.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
lay
--
lay
the
affidavit
aside
for
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
appreciate
that,
but
i
gather
the
trial
judge
finally
struck
the
affidavit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
erroneously
or
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
would
not
permit
jaffke
to
testify
that
knetzer
had
said
that
knetzer
had
not
turned
jaffke's
money
over
the
trustee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
there's
no
affidavit
in
the
record,
then
the
--
no
testimony
of
jaffke
in
the
record,
was
there
any
other
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
--
where
is
the
evidence
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
then
it's
already
gone
outside
the
record
in
saying
that?
