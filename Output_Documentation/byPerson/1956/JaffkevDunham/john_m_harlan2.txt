what
was
the
difference
between
the
$27,000
now
that
you
said
you
got
judgment
for
and
the
$36,000
which
had
claimed
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
your
$27,000
judgment
was
for
the
full
net
amount
that
you
claimed,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
intimation
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
thought
the
affidavit
was
inadmissible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
circumstances
under
which
the
affidavit
was
made?
justice
john
m.
harlan
1952.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
the
question
of
--
supposing
you
win
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
you
know
whether
that
affidavit
is
admissible,
it's
a
question
of
illinois
law,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
and
i
should
ask
you
one
of
the
other
but
isn't
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
isn't
state
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
aren't
there
really
three
questions?
one
is
the
question
of
justice
frankfurter's
but
which
the
question
we
have
to
decide.
and
assuming
that
you
win
on
that,
that
the
court
of
appeals
admits
it
was
--
was
mistaken
and
refusing
to
consider
the
affidavit,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
under
illinois
law,
i
should
think,
that
affidavit
was
admissible
and
assuming
that
it
is
admissible,
the
further
question
of
illinois
law
is
to
whether
the
facts
give
rise
to
a
constructive
trust
under
illinois
law.
and
aren't
those
both
state
law
questions
which,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
ought
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
not
passed
under
myself,
assuming
we
really
have
raised
a
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
good
impression
with
this
duration
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
everybody
will
agree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
vice-versa.
