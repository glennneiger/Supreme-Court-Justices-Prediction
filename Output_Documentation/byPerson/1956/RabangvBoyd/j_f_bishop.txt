mr.
j.
f.
bishop
a
correction
of
way
of
beginning,
this
correction
is
on
us.unfortunately,
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
petitioner,
sections
19
and
20
are
set
forth
substantially
as
they
were
in
the
1917
act.
we
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
among
you
a
copy
of
the
–
of
the
1917
sections
19
and
20
as
they
appeared
at
the
time
of
this
offense
and
conviction
that
is
just
before
the
1952
act.
that
is
of
the
importance,
i
may
not
be
able
to
reach
it
but
it
does
make
perhaps,
technically,
and
correct
our
statements,
the
1917
act
as
amendment.
it
is
--
as
it
appears
in
the
body
of
the
brief,
it
only
states
as
amended
to
include
the
substitution
of
the
attorney
general
for
the
secretary
of
labor.
but
that
sideslip
will
be
the
act
of
the
1917
act
as
it
was
in
effect
in
1951
and
1952.
now,
one
further
outright
error
which
has
slipped
in
on
both
of
us
but
which
i
don't
think
is
a
--
of
any
importance,
whatsoever,
but
that's
for
the
court
to
judge.
instead
of
the
words
"in
the
manner"
the
phrase
is
"in
manner"
provided
in.
that
is
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon
me.
in
the
1931
act,
that
appears
as
an
effort
not
only
in
our
statement
it
slipped
through
but
it
also
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
of
importance
but,
as
i
say,
i
want
the
court
to
be
fully
advised.
not
incorrectly
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
slips
in
unless
there
are
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
“the”
is
not
in
there.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
doesn't
belong
in
there.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
there
are
certain
gremlins
that
slipped
those
things
in
despite
of
us.
now,
there
are
--
just
a
couple
of
preliminary
corrections
that
are
not
on
our
cite
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
of
importance.
i
do
not
believe
it's
of
the
importance
in
this
case
as
to
the
sympathetic
element
that
this
is
a
minor
and
technical
violation.
there
are
no
minor
or
technical
violations
and
what
congress
has
enacted.
now,
if
that
is
deemed
of
any
importance
by
the
court,
i
wish
to
say
without
argument,
we
just
want
to
leave
the
citations
to
the
record
with
the
court
concerning
this
petitioner's
fine
of
a
$100
on
another
offense,
his
seven
arrests,
and
his
operation
under
an
alias.
now,
those
matters
are
in
the
record
and
if
there's
any
importance
in
what
petitioner
has
placed
in
the
brief
and
what
the
commissioner
apparently
rejected,
i
think
that
--
that
that
maybe
stated.
that
will
be
found
in
the
record
at
–
i
have
the
citations
somewhere,
commences
at
page
22.
that
was
his
own
statement.
now,
a
third
correction
which
is
a
matter
of
law.
i
believe
that
the
case
of
barber
versus
gonzalez
is
of
no
assistance
or
pertinence
in
this
case
at
all
for
the
reason
for
--
because
of
the
distinction
adduced
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
barber-gonzalez
was
--
versus
gonzalez
was
not
concerned
with
the
question
of
the
manner
of
deportation
at
all.
it
stemmed
from
a
deportation
because
of
the
1917
act,
a
provision
in
that
act
which
said,
which
require
after
entry,
no
dispute
about
it.
but
our
whole
dispute
in
this
act
is
whether
any
requirement
of
entry
is
involved
in
this
act.
and
with
that,
i
--
i
go
to
the
body
of
our
contention.
the
government's
position
is
that
we
have
two
inquiries
here.
first,
what
did
congress
say?
secondly,
was
there
any
reason
why
congress
was
not
empowered
to
say
this?
because,
i
will
probably
not
reach
the
second
matter.
i
would
also
take
a
text
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
sense
that
that
second
question,
very
extensively
discussed
in
our
brief,
is
a
question
of
long
history
and
i
submit
a
very
creditable
page
of
history
in
which
the
united
states
from
the
outset,
at
all
times,
promised
that
philippines'
independence
can
deliver.
it
did
not
promised
that
the
philippine
people
in
the
united
states
would
be
granted
something
in
addition
here
beyond
their
own
independence.
and
in
fact,
such
a
grant
of
something
--
of
american
citizenship
taking
them
away
from
the
philippines
would
perhaps,
in
some
degree,
have
been
inconsistent
with
our
protest
nations
and
our
actual
conduct
of
giving
them
independence
as
we
finally
did.
that
history,
as
i
say,
and
the
citations
of
statutes
in
which
from
the
outset,
their
whole
status
not
only
of
the
territory
but
of
the
peoples
of
the
philippines
was
left
for
future
disposition
and
there
was
nothing,
we
submit,
that
could
induce
them
ever
to
believe
that
they
were
going
to
get
something
permanent
in
the
united
states
in
addition
to
--
or
rather
in
contradistinction
from
their
own
country
factor.
now,
the
question
as
to
what
this
statute
said,
and
in
that,
i
think
the
court
would
be
much
more
interested
in
what
the
congress
said
and
what
i
have
to
say
and
i
wonder
in
that
--
for
that
purpose
the
statute
isn't
the
best
thing
to
look
at.
i
might
summarize
it
before
i
go
to
text
in
line,
it
--
as
our
position
being
this,
that
that
1931
act
said
that
any
alien
–-
any
alien
who
after
the
enactment
of
the
act,
which
was
february
18,
1951,
any
alien
after
february
1931
who
should
be
convicted
of
a
narcotics
offense
should
be
deported
in
the
--
in
manner
provided
in
sections
19
and
20,
in
manner
provided
in.
now,
that
word
"in
manner"
--
just
one
further
preliminary
is
--
does
not
come
to
us
naked.
it
comes
with
the
gloss
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bugajewitz
in
which
mr.
justice
holmes
had
squarely
before
him
the
question
of
distinguishing
the
words
"in
manner"
from
"as
provided
in."
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
bugajewitz.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
cited
yo
our
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
and
that,
we
can
--
we
believe
is
a
square
holding
that
that
is
a
red
light
in
the
statute
but
that
does
not
mean
that
you
incorporate
the
whole
statute.
that
means
that
the
substance,
again
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
distinction,
the
substance
as
distinguished
from
the
procedure,
and
justice
holmes
used
that
word
"procedure"
is
not
embodied
when
you
say
"in
the
manner."
it
means,
in
short,
just
what
it
says
that
you
only
go
to
elements
of
manner.
now,
with
that
preliminary,
i'll
try
to
divorce
myself
from
the
argument
and
go
to
the
statute
itself.
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
you
will
find
the
february
18,
1931
statute
set
forth.
and
it
says,
i
trust
exactly
what
i
said,
any
alien,
and
if
i
may
stop
there,
we
--
we
believe
that
that
unquestionably
is
prospective
as
well.
there
were
persons
unborn
at
the
time
of
that
statute
who
were
--
who
by
now
are
aliens
and
non-questionably
within
it.
i
read
on,
any
alien
except
an
addict
--
and
that
is
out
of
the
--
not
involved
here
--
who
after
february
18,
1931
shall
be
convicted
for
violation
of
or
conspiracy
to
violate
and
i
substitute
narcotics
acts.
and
i
go
down
to
the
14th
line,
"shall
be
taken
into
custody
and
deported"
in
the
manner
provided
in
sections
19
and
20.
now,
if
i
may
impose
on
to
court
to
compare
that
statute,
so
that
we
may
see
what
the
congress
provided,
with
the
earlier
1922
statute
which
you
will
find
in
petitioner's
brief.
if
you'll
obey
that
beside
you
on
page
11.
i
think
there
is
so
not
worthy,
a
change,
exactly
such
a
change
as
justice
holmes
spoke
of,
as
this
dispositive
of
the
case
in
itself.
on
page
11,
may
i
compare,
page
11
of
petitioner's
brief
where
the
1922
act
which
preceded
this
lies
there.
if
you
--
you
have
heard
the
arguments
that
somehow
entry
is
embodied
in
this
1931
act.
now
then,
what
has
happened
is
that
in
1931,
the
congress
took
entry
out
of
the
act.
let
me
read
from
page
11
of
petitioner's
brief.
that
former
act
said,
"any
alien
who
at
anytime,
after
his
entry,
is
convicted."
that
phrase
is
not
in
the
1931
act.
that
is
not
in
it.
the
congress
substituted
a
fixed
definite
date
and
eliminated
the
element
of
entry.
there
are
some
other
changes,
if
i
get
along
far
enough,
that
distinguished
some
of
these
cases
further
down
the
line.
i'll
just
touch
on
them
here
and
the
court,
if
i
reach
it,
may
find
its
significance
later.
if
you
go
back
to
the
government's
brief,
you
will
see,
"shall
be
taken
into
custody
and
deported
in
the
manner",
provided
in
the
sections
19
and
20.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
1922
act,
you
will
see,
that's
on
page
11
of
petitioner's
brief,
you
will
see
that
it
says
shall
be
taken
into
custody
and
deported
in
accordance
–-
no,
i
misspoke
myself.
upon
what
–
it
--
it
provides
what
is
not
provided
in
the
1931
act.
it
provides
upon
warrant
issued
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
now,
let
me
just
speak
very
quickly
as
to
what
that
distinction
means.
the
early
cases
--
i'll
accept
the
last
relied
upon
by
petitioner,
said
that
section
19
must
have
been
incorporated
because
section
19
just
didn't
have
anything
of
manner
in
it.
and
it
pointed
out,
those
cases
have
pointed
out,
that
the
1922,
this
earlier
act
which
has
been
changed,
provided
who
should
issue
that
warrant.
that
is
a
matter
of
manner.
and
they
said,
well,
section
19
must
have
been
incorporated
because
there
was
nothing
of
manner
to
put
into
it
but
the
1931
act
has
changed
that.
it
does
not
say
who
shall
issue
the
warrant
and
who
shall
take
him
into
custody
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
that
manner
provision
now
stands
and
you
have
to
look
to
section
19
to
find
out
who
it
is
that
is
to
do
--
do
the
deporting.
that's
a
matter
of
manner.
now,
i
have
finished
with
the
1931
act
and
now
i'm
going
to
page
3
of
the
government's
brief
where
we
begin
section
19
(a).
now,
in
looking
at
that,
there
are
two
questions.
one,
is
there
something
of
manner
in
that
section
19
that
is
incorporated
into
the
act?
how
much,
if
it
is
carried
over?
and
then
the
second
question,
is
there
so
much
talk,
such
exclusive
talk
of
entry
in
there
that
the
congress
in
1931
must
have
been
talking
about
entry.
my
answer
to
the
latter
question
is
no.
section
19
is
not
so
tied
up
with
entry
as
i
shall
demonstrate.
and
--
more
–
furthermore,
there
are
elements
of
manner
in
here.
now,
that
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'm
using
it
--
i'm
using
the
word
"in
the
manner."
i
think
there's
no
distinction.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
i
am
not.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'm
saying
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
will
–
i
will,
if
i
may,
depart
from
the
statutory
language
from
hereon
and
say
"in
the
manner"
because
it
seems
inevitable
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
i
--
it
means
the
same
thing.
now
then,
i
--
i
propose
to
go
right
down
page
3
of
the
government
brief
and
demonstrate
what
we
feel
is
manner,
what
is
carried
over
into
1931
act
and
thereby
demonstrate
that
there
is
an
element
of
manner
so
that
you
don't
have
to
look
to
elements
or
substance
to
carry
them
over.
now,
at
the
top
of
–
at
the
top
of
page
3
and
all
the
way
down,
that
page
is
all
substance.
it
does
not
say
how
you
shall
deport,
it
says
whom
you
shall
deport.
if
the
precedes
that
moment
where
the
determination
of
substance
is
made
that
someone
shall
be
deported.
that
is
not
an
element
of
manner,
whatsoever,
and
that
whole
page
is
devoted
only
to
the
question
of
who
shall
be
deported.
so,
if
there's
no
reason
for
carrying
any
of
that
over,
the
section
19
--
the
1931
act
tells
you
clearly
enough
who
shall
be
deported,
any
alien
who
commits
this
offense
after
1931.
and
i
go
through
--
i
go
down
at
page
4.
and
--
and
there
was
no
element
of
manner
until
you
get
to
the
10th
line
from
the
bottom
where
it
says
--
where
it
finally
says
what
you
shall
do
with
these
people
whom
the
access
shall
be
deported.
and
there
you
have
the
words,
10th
line
from
the
bottom
of
page
4,
shall
upon
the
warrant
of
the
attorney
general
be
taken
under
custody.
now,
that
is
an
element
of
manner.
that
is
carried
over
into
the
1931
act
as
if
you
were
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
is
not.
it
is
not
who
shall
do
it.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
but
conspicuously
in
the
1931
act,
it
does
not
tell
who
shall
do
the
custody
taken.
it's
not
left
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
1922
act,
it
couldn't
have
been
manner
for
the
1922
act
because
it
was
in
the
1922
act,
but
it
is
not
in
the
1931
act.
so,
that
i
say
when
you
look
to
what
is
the
element
of
manner
that
is
to
be
carried
over
into
the
1931
act,
here
it
is,
the
designation
of
who
is
to
do
the
deportee.
i
think
that
the
question,
who
is
to
do
the
deportee,
is
a
matter
of
manner,
and
that
is
carried
over
and
that's
about
all.
but
there
are
some
--
there
are
some
provisos
on
page
4.
i
direct
your
attention
right
after
this
clause
which
i've
just
reached,
the
10th
line
from
the
bottom,
there
is
an
asterisk.
and
i'm
sorry,
i
regret
now
but
we
took
that
part
out.
it
is
not
completely
pertinent
but
it's
highly
illuminated.
that
asterisk
covers
a
passage
which
says
that
if
a
female,
after
immorality
--
after
a
certain
statutory
morality,
marries
a
citizen,
she
does
not
gain
citizenship.
now,
that
is
clearly
not
manner,
it
isn't
even
substantive
on
the
subject
of
who
shall
be
deported.
it
is
yet
another
aspect
of
section
19
and
obviously
would
not
be
carried
over
into
19
--
into
the
1931
act.
i
again
use
this
to
demonstrate
that
there
are
things
to
be
carried
over
into
the
1931
act
and
there
are
things
not
to
be
carried
over
and
the
only
thing
to
be
carried
over
is
manner.
now
that
provision
i've
just
adverted
to
is
clearly
not
manner.
and
then,
there
is
another
proviso
to
the
effect
that
the
provision
of
this
section
shall
not
apply,
that
is
the
two
moral
turpitude
cases,
shall
not
apply
if
there
is
a
pardon
or
if
there
is
a
recommendation
by
the
judge.
now
that,
as
to
the
carry
over
of
that
to
the
1931
act,
there
has
been
a
conflict.
i
am
frank
to
say
that
i
think
that
conflict
arose
on
of
very
ill-advised
lower
court
opinions
which
did
not
distinguish
from
the
1922
act.
under
the
1922
act,
as
i've
indicated,
there
was
some
ground
for
saying
that
when
they
said
in
the
manner
of
19
--
section
19,
they
must
have
carried
over
the
whole
act
and
the
cases
relied
on
by
petitioners
say
that
because
there
was
no
element
of
manner
to
refer
to
and
so
they
said
"this
must
be
manner."
i
think
that
is
wrong.
the
(inaudible)
case
which
we
cite
says
it's
wrong.
that's
another
circuit.
and
in
the
1952
act,
i
may
say
that
the
congress
at
least
has
indicated
what
that
congress
felt
about
it
irrespective
of
the
propriety
of
past
interpretations
and
it
has
provided
specifically
that
those
suspension
and
--
and
pardon
provisions
--
i
shouldn't
say
suspension,
i
should
say
the
pardon
provisions
of
the
judicial
recommendation
provisions
do
not
carry
over
into
the
1931
act,
whatever
gloss
that
later
opinion
may
give
with
its
limitations.
so
that
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
–
that
the
question
of
pardon
and
recommendation
is
not
a
matter
of
manner
to
carry
over
but
it
is
not
significant
to
the
present
case
because
they're
not
trying
to
carry
over
any
pardon
or
recommendation
idea
of
that
--
nothing
of
a
kind
was
given
here.
it
is
used
by
petitioner
as
an
analogy.
the
petitioner's
argument,
as
i
conceded,
is
that
if
you
carry
over
to
the
1931
act,
the
partner
as
being
a
matter
of
manner
with
an
entry
also
that
there's
a
broad
purpose
to
carry
over.
well,
i
think
that
that's
not
applicable
here.
the
case
is
unclear,
they're
not
imported
to
this
case
where
they're
tying
to
carry
over
a
sort
of
amorphous
entry
concept
that
is
not
there.
now,
i
am
plotting
along
through
here
because
i
still
think
that
that
is
what's
decisive.
after
that
proviso,
we
--
there
is
--
there
is
one
thing
that's
a
little
closer
to
manner
on
page
5.
about
five
lines
down,
you'll
see,
"nor
shall
any
--
any
alien
convicted
as
a
aforesaid
be
deported
until
after
determination
of
his
imprisonment."
now,
that
is
a
matter
of
time
of
deportation
and
might
conceivably
be
an
element
of
manner
and
carried
over
to
the
1931
act.
that
again
isn't
conclusive
here
but
it
is
pertinent
to
my
contention
that
there
were
elements
of
manner
that
could
be
carried
over
and
you
don't
have
to
look
elsewhere
and
drag
in
matters
of
manner
that
are
not
manner
but
substance.
and
then
as
you
go
down
the
--
then
we
come
to
the
provision
on
which
petitioner
places
his
greatest
reliance,
on
page
5,
provided
further
--
i'm
at
line
eight
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief.
this
is
still
the
section
19.
and
this
is
the
one
that
petitioner
thinks
indicates
that
unless
you
have
entry,
1931
could
not
function.
but
we
think
it
could
--
can
function
very
well
and
that
this
is
not
pertinent.here
is
the
proviso,
provided
further
that
the
provisions
of
this
section
with
the
exceptions
here
before
noted,
shall
be
applicable
to
the
classes
of
aliens
therein
mentioned
irrespective
of
the
time
of
their
entry
in
the
united
states.
i
have
just
two
things
to
say
about
that.
one,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
manner,
it
is
again
a
matter
of
substance.
it
says,
"this
person
shall
be
deported
whether
or
not
he
came
in
to
the
united
states
at
a
certain
time."
in
other
words,
it
says
who
shall
be
deported
not
the
manner
of
deportation
at
all.
i
don't
think
it
carries
over
into
the
1931
act.
but
i
have
this
further
comment
that
even
if
it
were
carried
over
and
written
into
that
act,
it
is
still
a
negative
thing.
it
just
says
something
if
it
happens
shall
not
apply.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
say
that
we
shall
carry
over
then
that
this
has
to
happen.
it
just
says
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
the
time
of
entry.
nothing
more
than
that.
so
that
if
it
were
written
into
1931,
it
wouldn't
mean
anything.
but
i
return
again
to
my
first
comment,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
manner
of
deportation.
it
says
who
shall
be
deported.
now,
i'm
at
about
line
12
now
of
page
5
in
section
19.
it
says,
"provided
further
that
the
provision
of
this
section
shall
also
apply
but
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
do
not
believe
so.
first
of
all,
it
isn't
carried
over
into
the
1931
act.
it's
not
a
matter
of
manner,
it's
a
matter
of
who
it
shall
apply
to,
who
shall
be
deported,
who
shall
be
deported,
not
how.
that's
the
first
thing
i
have
to
say
about
it.
secondly,
the
use
of
aliens
in
this
particular,
in
section
19,
like
the
use
of
the
word
"entry"
has
a
great
number
of
--
of
tangential
importances,
none
of
which,
i
believe,
apply
here.
in
other
words,
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
go
beyond
the
actual
structural
basis
of
this
act
and
try
to
pick
out
a
few
words
to
build
up
a
gloss
which
frankly
is
foreclosed
by
the
word
"manner."
this
clause
is
clearly
substance
who
shall
be
deported.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
wouldn't
know
without
checking
each
of
these
some
14
proofs
here
of
aliens
who
are
provided
in
this
case.
i
have
the
--
the
immigration
acts
are
of
such
complexity
that
in
each
case,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
do
the
--
the
hard
day
labor
job
that
i'm
trying
to
do
here
of
applying
it
to
the
specific
case.
i
don't
believe
that
it
adds
any
gloss
and
i
--
i
don't
think
that
i
can
give
a
--
a
comprehensive
answer.
i
wouldn't
dare
to
try
to
answer
that.
it
looks
to
me
simply
as
showing
that
in
--
let
me
say
this,
there
are
so
many
of
the
substantive
provisions
in
this
act
that
are
dependent
upon
entry
of
an
alien
that
i
think
this
is
a
caveat
that
entry
certainly
shall
apply
if
an
alien
comes
from
outside,
from
one
of
the
–
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
it
says
insular
possessions.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
clearly
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
think
it
seeks
to
exclude
filipinos,
i
think
it
seeks
to
assure
that
the
fact
that
the
dutchman
didn't
come
from
the
–
from
the
indies.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
and
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
can
tell
that
in
this
respect.
section
19
covers
some
cases
that
say
so
many
years
after
entry,
an
alien
coming
in
so
many
years
after
entry,
it
also
has
some
cases
in
which
they
say
any
time
after
entry
and
it
has
some
cases
which
i
have
hoped
to
reach
which
would
--
i
will
not
reach
unfortunately
until
after
recess,
in
which
no
entry
was
required
at
all.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
and
so
your
dutchman,
the
case
would
not
be
concerned
at
all
by
this
provision
and
i
have
to
point
that
out
if
i
have
time
after
recess
--
in
those
cases,
he
would
not
be
concerned
at
all
where
entry
is
not
involved.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
filipino
--
let
me
say
arbitrarily
and
i
hope
to
explain
later,
the
filipino
would
be
covered
in
cases
where
he
does
not
have
to
make
an
entry
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
where
he
has
to
make
an
entry
then
barber
versus
gonzalez
would
apply
and
seeing
that
it
came
from
the
then
possession
that
would
have
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
understand
that
i
have
one
minute.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would
like
to
take
the
opportunity
to
correct
an
error
that
occurs
in
our
brief
on
page
19
and
which
house
report
1513
should
read
house
report
1365.
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
comment.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
on
page
19,
house
report
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
end
of
the
quotation,
1513
in
incorrect.
it
should
read
1365.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
comment.
the
case
of
bugajewitz
against
adams
which
was
relied
on
so
heavily
by
the
government,
the
congress
had
amended
specifically
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
in
a
1907
act
by
passing
in
1910,
an
act
which
cut
out
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
was
that
that
mr.
justice
holmes
was
talking
about
in
that
opinion,
that
vulnerable
case
and
the
reliance
which
the
government
places
upon
the
use
of
the
words
in
the
manner
of
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
substance
of
the
holding
in
that
case.
thank
you.
