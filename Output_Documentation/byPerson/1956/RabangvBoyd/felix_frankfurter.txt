i
must
have
misunderstood
–
i
must
misunderstand
you.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
power
to
deport
cannot
be
legislated
authorized
by
congress
unless
as
to
those
aliens?
they
have
been
the
power
to
that
--
those
aliens
were
excludable
at
the
time
or
are
you
merely
saying
they
were
potentially
excludable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
constitutional
--
this
inability
in
this
case?
what
is
the
constitutional
limitation
which
you're
invoking
against
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
the
lord
knows
i
don't
want
to
reach
it,
but
i
thought
you
permit
in
the
constitutional
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
do
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
starting
point
is
going
to
be
argued
at
great
length
in
cases
that
will
concede
you
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
starting
point
about
the
power
of
congress
to
denationalize
will
be
argued,
as
i
understand
it,
at
great
length
today
and
tomorrow
or
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
dealing
here
with
the
denationalized
--
with
the
–
with
a
person
whom
congress
first
denationalized
in
order
to
be
deported?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
he
was
an
american
citizen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
national.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
may
have
been
here
as
a
matter
of
right.
that
doesn't
tell
us
what
status
he
had
in
being
here
while
he's
allowed
to
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
--
do
i
have
to
decide
whether,
a
filipino,
being
here
because
he
was
a
filipino
and
the
particular
connection
to
be
in
the
philippine
islands
had
the
relation
they
had
because
that's
all
that's
expected
that
they
would
be
set
free
and
independent?
must
i
decide
in
this
case
that
congress,
by
allowing
filipinos
to
come
in
because
of
our
relation
to
those
islands,
that
therefore,
he
had
the
same
status
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
beside
these
islands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even
so,
you're
very
careful
to
say
he
was
a
national,
not
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then,
we've
got
another
problem.
would
you
open
them
up
if
you're
going
to
deal
with
this
rather
than
go
to
the
legislation?
the
power
of
congress
over,
people
who
were
here
were
not
citizens,
and
you
came
here
rightfully
when
they
came
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
problem
of
--
that's
a
very
complicated
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
would
(voice
overlap)
instead
of
shares.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
go
to
procedural
provisions
for
deportation?
instead
of
what
i
might
call
a
substantive
provision
of
the
act
of
1931
could
be
an
alien
under
that
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
he
is
or
he
isn't.
you
claim
he
isn't
an
alien
under
that
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
–
isn't
that
--
if
you
established
that
couldn't
even
bother
about
anything
else,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
was
the
matter,
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
1931
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
than
belief
--
more
than
belief
is
the
formal
expression,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
agree
that
another
relative
--
relevant
consideration,
the
provision
in
the
filipino
independence
act,
giving
resident
filipinos
the
option
of
becoming
american
citizens,
or,
if
not,
automatically
becoming
filipino
national,
filipinos.
is
that
relevant
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i'm
right
in
recalling
that
that
was
a
provision
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
–
what's
their
provision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
an
ordinary
provision
giving
filipinos
an
opportunity
upon
a
defendant
to
become
american
citizen?
i
may
--
i
may
have
--
have
a
false
memory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
enough
to
determine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
put
in
the
"the"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
put
in
the
"the"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
suggest
--
i
mean,
the
“the”
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case,
mr.
bishop?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
–
do
i
gather
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
alien
means
a
dutchman
coming
from
the
southeast
indies
as
of
that
time
by
way
of
the
philippines
--
aliens,
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
excluding
filipinos.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
want
to
know
whether
it's
restricted
to
people
in
the
position
of
a
dutchman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
just
as
to
that
or
whether
alien
in
this
sense
is
--
is
more
generically
anybody
who
is
not
an
american
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
you
can't
tell
that
without
making
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
worrying
about
the
dutchman,
if
i
may
say
so.
i'm
worrying
about
the
filipino,
whether
--
whether
alien
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
may
i
just
say
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
you
do
not
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
whether
or
not
a
filipino
resident
in
the
united
states,
who
when
he
came
here
was
a
filipino
national,
is
included
in
the
terms
of
the
act
of
february
18,
1931,
any
alien
which
is
the
real
question
before
us.
i
take
it,
you
do
not
mean
to
leave
the
impression
that
that
question
is
determined
by
our
construction
of
the
proviso
about
what
we've
been
talking
about,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
--
having
led
you
to
make
one
answer
of
what
of
--
to
clear
what
i
didn't
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
agree
--
suppose
one
agrees
that
in
construing
any
part
of
the
immigration
laws,
the
whole
network
of
legislation
becomes
relevant
for
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
--
all
i
meant
to
ask
you
is
whether
you
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
--
that
that
proviso
is
controlling
not
that
it's
relevant.
you
would
say
it's
relevant
but
it's
not
controlling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
were
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
not.
not
only
there
weren't
treated
as
such,
they
were
not.
you
can
say
that
categorically,
can't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute.
may
i
trouble
you,
state
that
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
