mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
each
time
you
use
--
each
time
you
use
that
word
"manner"
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
you
using
it
in
a
different
sense
and
you
used
it
in
your
briefs
and
in
the
courts
below
when
--
when
you
use
the
word
"the
manner"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that's
–
that's
what
i
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
can't
say
in
manner
–
in
manner
and
i
--
i
wondered
if
you
were
making
any
distinction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
you
just
when
you
please
only.
i
just
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
may
i
ask
this
before
you
go
any
farther.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
proviso
that
follows
the
one
you
just
read
have
any
bearing
on
--
on
the
case?
it
says
provided
further
that
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
also
apply
to
the
cases
of
aliens
who
come
to
the
mainland
of
the
united
states
from
the
insular
possessions
thereof.
now,
there's
a
fact
that
they
don't
say
aliens
and
--
and
nationals
indicate
that
they
meant
only
aliens
and
not
--
not
nationals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
–
let
me
ask
you
this,
in
that
proviso
which
i
just
read,
do
you
think
that
the
word
aliens
includes
nationals
who
came
to
continent
of
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
insular
possessions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
for
that
purpose.
i
don't
think
it
is
--
affects
our
problem
in
any
respect
even
by
tangential
gloss.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
are
they
included
in
that
--
are
they
included
in
that
word
alien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
--
maybe
you
can
answer
at
one
word,
yes
or
no.
do
the
--
are
these
filipinos
included
in
that
word
aliens?
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
--
you
have
told
us
what
a
lot
of
other
things
mean
but
you
didn't
tell
or
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
they
are
included
in
this
proviso?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
it
read
then,
as
you
quoted
here
in
the
--
as
you
quoted
here,
as
you
quoted
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
well,
i'll
let
it
go
at
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
it
might
have
some
bearing
because
you
--
you
read
--
read
the
proviso
that
just
preceded
it
as
--
as
being
very
important
to
your
case
and
i
thought
that
possibly
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
next
proviso
might
also
have
a
bearing
on
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
go
right
at
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
welcome.
