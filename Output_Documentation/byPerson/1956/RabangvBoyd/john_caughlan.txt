mr.
john
caughlan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
born
a
united
states
national
in
the
philippine
islands
in
1910.
he
came
to
the
united
states
as
a
non-excludable
national
in
1930
and
has
lived
here
ever
since
having
acquired
an
american
family
and
property.
in
1951,
he
was
convicted
on
his
plea
of
guilty
of
a
minor
and
technical
violation
of
the
narcotics
law
of
united
states
to
which
he
was
given
a
suspended
sentence.
about
a
month
later,
deportation
proceedings
were
commenced
against
him
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
an
alien
subject
to
deportation,
having
been
convicted
of
a
narcotics
offense,
under
the
act
of
february
18th,
1931.
and
he
was
eventually
ordered
deported.
however,
the
proceedings
to
deport
him
were
stayed
in
1952
by
reason
of
the
then
tendency
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
case
of
mangaoang
against
boyd
and
gonzales
against
barber,
the
latter
case
reaching
this
court
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
as
barber
against
gonzales.
following
the
decision
by
this
court
of
barber
against
gonzales,
which
rejected
the
government's
contention,
that
a
filipino
who'd
arrive
in
the
united
states
before
the
1934
independence
act,
was
subject
to
deportation
for
an
offense
or
for
under
--
on
any
grounds
where
statute
provided
for
deportation
after
entry.
following
that
decision,
the
regional
director
immigration
moved
to
reopen
these
proceedings
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
terminate
the
proceedings
due
taking
other
appropriate
action.
the
board,
however,
refused
to
do
this
on
the
grounds
that
the
1931
statute
does
not
use
in
so
many
words
the
term,
"entry",
whereas
the
act
of
1917
uses
specifically
the
terms
after
entry.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
the
term
"after
entry"
or
"entry",
as
used
in
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
is
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
1931
act,
and
that
this
case
is
fully
controlled
by
the
case
of
barber
against
gonzales.
the
--
in
the
barber
case,
as
i've
already
stated,
the
question
was
whether
under
section
19
(a)
of
the
immigration
act,
an
alien
was
subject
to
deportation.
section
19
(a)
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
which
is
quoted
in
full
on
pages
26
and
27
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
provides
that
any
alien
who
is
hereafter
sentenced
more
than
once
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
because
of
conviction
in
this
country
of
any
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
committed
in
any
time
after
entry
shall
be
taken
into
custody
and
deport
it.
and
this
court
held,
of
course,
that
entry
means
a
coming
into
the
united
states
from
the
outside
and
not
simply
an
arrival
here
by
a
citizen
or
a
national.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
1917
act,
the
very
act
interpreted
in
barber
against
gonzales,
applies
to
this
case,
first,
because
it
is
a
necessary
implication
of
any
deportation
statute
that
to
be
an
entry
that
that
is
constitutionally
implied.
secondly,
because
the
expressed
language
of
reference
in
the
1931
act
does
specifically
incorporate
the
provisions
of
entry.
before
considering
the
particular
language
of
the
1931
act,
we
urge
and
suggest
that
the
term
"entry"
has
a
somewhat
deeper
significance
than
a
mere
term
of
art
used
in
the
statute.
we
believe
that
it
expresses
the
relationship
between
--
or
other
person
who
is
subject
to
deportation
to
the
constitutional
source
of
the
power
to
deport.
but
in
another
way,
a
person
on
entering
united
states,
on
passing
the
exclusion
barriers,
and
being
admitted
into
this
country
is
given
a
conditional
license
to
remain
here
so
long
as
he
abides
by
the
conditions
imposed,
or
if
the
broadest
interpretation,
if
the
broadest
construction
of
congressional
power
is
--
is
given,
until
congress
revokes
the
license.
while
terms
of
sovereignty
has
been
used
with
regard
to
aliens,
we
suggest
that
that
applies
to
the
external
relations
of
united
states
and
that
the
distinction
between
exclusion
and
deportation
has
been
recognized
in
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court.
and
that
if
the
tenth
amendment
is
to
be
given
a
force,
the
power
to
expel
or
deport
must
be
implied
from
some
provisions
of
the
constitution,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
internal
policy
of
the
united
states.
as
distinguished
from
its
external
policy,
the
power
to
deport
is
not
unlimited.
the
united
states
does
not
have
the
power
to
denationalize
one
with
the
right
to
be
here,
and
thereupon,
order
him
expelled
to
a
foreign
country
or
banished.
and
we
believe
that
this
concept
of
sovereignty
and
distinguishing
its
internal
and
its
external
aspects
has
been
well
recognized
from
the
earliest
deportation
cases
after
the
present.
one
rule
applies
to
exclusion,
and
another
to
deportation,
that
deportation,
in
a
sense,
is
simply
a
special
instance
of
the
power
to
exclude
a
reasonable
and
proper
implication
from
the
power
to
exclude
and
that
absent
of
the
power
to
exclude,
there
can
be
no
power
of
any
kind
to
deport.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
has
ever
suggested
in
any
act
that
the
power
to
deport
exist
apart
from
the
power
to
exclude,
and
that
deportation
can
be
anything
but
a
revocation
of
the
license
of
the
alien
to
come
in
to,
to
remain
in
the
united
states,
it's
not
something
separated
in
defendant
because
it's
implied
from
the
exclusion
powers.
mr.
john
caughlan
potentially.
i
--
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
made
clear
that
the
--
its
potential
excludability,
in
other
words,
the
alien,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
surely
has
issued
a
conditional
license
to
enter
and
remain
which
license
congress
may
revoke
by
a
subsequent
change
of
laws.
but
the
source
of
the
power,
it
seems
to
me,
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
must
be
implied
from
the
exclusion
power.
mr.
john
caughlan
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
don't
think
that
we
really
need
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
here,
but
i'm
--
i
will
say
this,
because
--
mr.
john
caughlan
we
suggest
that
the,
that
congress
hasn't
exceeded
constitutional
limitations
in
this
case,
but
no
constitutional
power
exist.
mr.
john
caughlan
to
deport
one
who
has
the
right
to
be
here
and
stay
here
already.
congress
can't
pass
a
law
denationalizing
a
citizen
or
a
national.
and
then
say,
this
person
is
subject
to
exclusion
to
–
to
expulsion
from
the
united
states,
because
he's
never
been
potentially
subject
to
exclusion.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
caughlan
very
well.
i
--
i'm
not
referring
to
the
power
to
denationalize.
mr.
john
caughlan
--
but
only
to
the
power
to
--
to
deport
as
--
as
arising
out
of
the
original
power
to
exclude,
the
potential
power
to
exclude.
there
is
no
other
place
in
the
constitution
that
i
can
see
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
found.
mr.
john
caughlan
i'm
accepting
that
as
the
--
i
think
the
government
accepts
that
as
the
position.
the
--
this
man
came
to
united
states
as
a
national.he
was
a
national.
he
entered
and
remained
here.
he
came
here
and
was
here
as
a
national.
according
to
the
contentions
--
mr.
john
caughlan
no,
he
came
as
an
american
national.
mr.
john
caughlan
according
to
the
--
we
think
he
still
remains
a
national.
but
according
to
contention
of
--
of
the
government,
he
is
now
an
alien
by
reason
of
the
operation
of
the
1934
philippine
independence
act.
so,
he
was
here
as
a
matter
of
right.
now,
he's
been
denationalized
and
--
according
to
government's
contention.
and
now
they
say,
he
is
subject
to
deportation.
we
say
that
part
does
not
exist.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
i
think
it's
conceded
that
he
came
here.
mr.
john
caughlan
oh
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
decide
that
the
status
of
nationals
and
filipinos
is
identical
on
this
case
or
any
other
case.
i
would
–
i
would
say
no,
sir.
moreover,
i
don't
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
caughlan
we
do
take
that
position.
we
say
that
there's
nothing
that
can
be
read
in
the
--
in
the
1934
act.
the
fair
reading
of
the
act
that
would
–
would
denationalize
those
who
were
here
resident,
as
nationals.
and
that
is
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
john
caughlan
oh
no,
he
was
not
a
citizen.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
mr.
john
caughlan
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
--
and
i
will
say
this,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
caughlan
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
and
i
--
if
i
may
well
proceed
to
the
--
what
i
think
is
the
--
the
act
which
covers
the
situation,
i
believe,
completely.
the
act
of
february
18th,
1931,
provides
that
any
alien,
who
after
the
enactment
of
the
act,
shall
be
convicted
for
a
violation
or
conspiracy
to
violate
a
narcotics
law,
this
appears
on
pages
7
and
8
of
the
brief,
shall
be
taken
in
custody
and
deported
in
the
manner
provided
in
sections
19
and
20
of
the
act
of
february
5th,
1917.
now,
it's
clearer
that
this
act
has
no
provisions,
whatsoever,
in
and
of
itself,
for
deportation.
the
acts
of
--
the
manner
of
deportation,
which
congress
had
in
mind
at
that
time,
is
set
forth
in
section
20
of
the
act
of
1917.
this
section,
which
is
quoted
in
--
full
on
pages
28
and
30
of
our
brief,
discusses
in
detail
the
picking
up
of
the
alien,
the
expense
of
his
deportation,
his
detention,
the
hearings
which
are
to
be
taken
place
in
–
in
the
case
and
the
--
his
release
upon
bail
while
hearings
are
pending.
the
section
20
makes
two
classes
of
aliens
for
purposes
of
deportation,
for
the
manner
of
deportation.
class
one,
aliens
as
to
whom
deportations'
proceedings
are
instituted
at
any
time
within
five
years
after
entry.
and
class
two,
aliens
as
to
whom
deportation
proceedings
are
entered
at
any
time
later
than
five
years
after
entry.
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
29.
there
are
only
those
two
classes.
obviously,
as
far
as
this
section
is
concerned,
there
is
no
manner
of
deporting
a
person
who
never
entered
the
united
states
as
this
case
--
as
in
this
case.
because
this
is
the
same
act
which
was
construed
in
the
barber
case,
and
there
is
nothing
in
section
20
to
indicate
that
entry
has
any
different
meaning
than
it
did
in
section
19.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
john
caughlan
we
do
claim
he's
not
an
alien
but
--
mr.
john
caughlan
that's
true.
we
--
we
didn't
bother
by
anything
else.
if
he's
not
an
alien,
then
he's
not
deportable.
mr.
john
caughlan
but
we
do
feel
that
this
case
has
been
directly
decided
by
barber,
the
question
as
to
whether
filipinos
are
or
are
not
now
aliens
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
it's
a
very
important
issue.
it's
something
that,
perhaps,
should
be
decided.
but,
we
don't
think
that
even
that
question
needs
to
be
decided
here
if
the
court
doesn't
choose
to
decide
it
because
of
the
very
clear
provisions,
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
that
--
the
1931
act
applied
only
to
those
who
entered.
i
might
say
this.
it's
very
obvious
that
in
1931,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
congress
couldn't
have
intended
the
act
to
apply
to
filipinos.
mr.
john
caughlan
in
1931,
because
they
were
not
aliens
in
1931.
at
best,
they
became
aliens
in
1946.
of
course
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
language
of
the
statute
might
not
be
broad
enough
to
phrase
some
class
not
been
included.
but
certainly,
they
weren't
included
at
that
time.
mr.
john
caughlan
he
committed
the
offense,
mr.
justice
clark,
in
1951.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
so
that
the
government
contends
he
was
then
an
alien
and
it
makes
no
difference
why
he
stayed
this
way
before.
we
also
wish
to
call
attention
to
section
19
which
is
also
referred
--
referred
to
in
a
manner
of
deportation
in
the
1931
act.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
19
does
not
have
anything
to
do
as
a
manner
of
deportation.
section
19
simply
catalogues
a
class
whose
section
is
--
is
quoted
in
full
on
pages
26,
27,
and
28,
and
in
part
on
pages
14
and
15
of
our
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
pages
9
and
10
of
our
brief.
this
act
simply
catalogues
the
various
types
of
aliens
who
were
subject
to
deportation.
in
costanzo
against
dillingham,
which
is
cited
in
the
government
brief,
the
--
this
court,
considering
the
section,
noted
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
simply
group
to
various
previous
classes
of
deportable
aliens
into
one
section.
it
does
contain,
however,
some
general
provisos
which
are
applicable,
some
of
them
to
all
classes
and
others
to
particular
classes.
and
one
of
the
provisos
that
is
involved
in
the
section
states,
very
definitely,
that
the
provisions
of
this
section,
with
the
exceptions
here
and
above
noted
shall
be
applicable
to
the
classes
of
aliens
therein
mentioned
irrespective
of
the
time
of
entry.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
did
not
consider
the
relationship
of
the
1931
act
to
the
1917
act
at
all
in
this
case,
nevertheless,
in
a
line
of
earlier
cases
as
held
that
references
to
section
19
in
narcotics
acts,
the
jones-miller
act
of
1922
and
this
1931
act
was
in
effect
an
amendment
of
section
19.
and
that
a
new
class
of
aliens
was
added
to
those
deportable
under
section
19.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1931
act
supports
this
view
to
the
extent
that
the
1931
act
was
introduced
as
a
bill
to
amend
--
this
appears
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
is
a
bill
to
amend
the
immigration
act
of
1917
by
providing
for
the
deportation
of
an
alien
convicted
on
violation
of
the
harrison
narcotics
law.
the
bill
was
passed
without
change
in
substance,
although,
after
it
was
enacted
by
the
house
under
that
title,
the
senate
amended
the
title
because
the
language
of
the
act
is
not
strictly
amendatory.
mr.
john
caughlan
the
general
--
the
third
general
proviso
which
is
applicable
to
all
classes
in
that
bill
does
indicate
the
intent
of
congress
to
make
entry
applicable
to
all
classes
because
it
states,
and
this
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
28,
the
provisions
of
this
section
with
the
exceptions,
here
and
before
noted,
shall
be
applicable
to
the
classes
of
aliens
therein
mentioned,
irrespective
at
the
time
of
entering
the
united
states.
so
that
entry
--
there
it
says
irrespective
of
the
time
of
entry,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
entry
is
certainly
made
applicable
to
all
classes
of
aliens.
and
if
these
general
proviso
was
applicable
to
the
1931
act
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
long
line
of
cases
dealing
with
the
very
similar
act
and
was
one
case
dealing
with
this
type
of
act,
over
this
particular
act,
held
those
provisos
are
applicable
to
the
section
31
then
entries
involved
here.
now,
i
do
want
to
pass
into
the
final
point
here,
which
we,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
an
answer
to
the
question
proposed
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
believe
it
is
necessary
even
for
the
court
to
reach
but
we
certainly
believe
it's
here,
and
as
the
court
does
reach
it,
we
think
that
it
--
it
would
dispose
with
the
case
also.
and
that
is,
that
the
petitioner
is
not
now
an
alien.
concededly,
he
came
here
as
a
national.
concededly,
he
has
done
nothing
voluntarily
to
change
his
status
as
a
national.
the
question
is
whether
congress,
by
the
provisions
of
the
–
of
the
philippine
independence
act
of
1934
made
that
act
applicable
to
philippine
persons
who
had
come
here
as
nationals
and
were
then
resident
in
the
united
states.
the
act,
of
course,
does
not
specifically
so
state.
the
government
in
its
brief,
goes
at
some
–
in
some
considerable
length
to
discuss
the
general
relations
of
the
united
states
with
the
philippine
islands,
the
non-imperialistic
policies,
the
belief
that
the
conception
that
they
would
become
independent
--
mr.
john
caughlan
yes.
that's
–
that's
quite
correct.
the
--
the
matter
was
a
subject
of
debate
for
a
long
period
of
time
that
the
--
our
government
had
always
expressed
its
view
that
they
would
become
independent.
now,
however,
the
--
as
indicated
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
court
below
has
held
or
has
stated,
i
should
say,
there
is
nowhere
that
can
be
found
in
the
act,
anything
to
indicate
the
express
intention
of
congress
to
apply
it
to
resident
filipinos.
the
provisions
relating
to
filipinos
during
the
period
of
time
between
the
--
between
1934
and
1946
when
the
--
the
independence
was
eventually
effectuated,
states
in
this
--
it
appears
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
for
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
this
section
and
all
other
laws
of
the
united
states
relating
to
immigration,
exclusion,
or
expulsion
of
aliens,
citizens
of
the
philippine
islands
who
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
be
considered
as
if
they
are
aliens.
for
such
purpose,
the
philippine
islands
shall
be
considered
as
a
separate
country
and
shall
have
for
each
fiscal
year,
a
quota
of
50.
we
contend
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
that
section
is
that
it
was
intended
to
have
a
prospective
effect
to
operate
against
filipinos
who
would
be
coming
to
this
country
as
immigrants
and
not
to
operate
against
national
filipinos
who
already
were
resident
here
and
would
come
without
restriction.
mr.
john
caughlan
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
with
--
mr.
john
caughlan
i
--
i
do
not,
with
due
respect,
i
don't
believe
that
that
provision
could
have
been
in
the
act
because,
actually
it
was
until
1947,
that
filipinos
were
generally
eligible
for
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
caughlan
there
--
there
are
racial
exclusions
against
the
--
mr.
john
caughlan
so
far
as
i
know,
the
only
option
given
was
the
option
to
return
to
the
philippines
at
government's
expense.
now,
that
was
–-
mr.
john
caughlan
it's
interesting
to
know
that
section
14,
which
is
operative
upon
complete
withdrawal
of
the
philippine
islands,
as
distinguished
from
section
8
which
applies
to
exclusion,
its
immigration
exclusion
and
expulsion
relates
only
to
immigration
laws.
now,
well
that
may
be
a
general
reference.
we
suggest
that
the
act
was
intended
to
imply
only
to
filipinos
who
prospectively
would
come
to
the
united
states
as
immigrants
after
1934
and
not
to
those
there
present.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
noted
that
the
question
was
not
in
the
cabebe
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
the
question
is
not
directly
answered
by
special
reference
to
inclusion
or
exclusion
in
any
of
these
acts,
the
filipinos
who
are
no
longer
residing
in
the
islands
on
the
date
of
their
independence.
the
court
does
go
on
to
say
that
it
believed
that
congress
intended
to
apply
it
to
all
filipinos.
we
do
not
believe,
that
a
status
as
important
as
nationality,
that
a
status
as
important
as
the
right
to
remain,
or
that
the
deportation
of
an
alien
should
be
made
to
depend
upon
a
statute
which
is
capable
of
two
different
instruction
--
constructions,
one
favorable
to
the
alien,
and
one
requiring
deportation.
we
think
that
applies
both
to
the
1931
act
which
certainly
can
properly
be
construed
as
incorporating
the
entry
sections
of
sections
20
and
19.
we
believe
it
equally
applies
to
the
philippine
independence
act
which
can
be
construed
has
not
applied
to
those
filipinos
who
came
here
as
nationals.
so
that
under
either
view,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
enter,
came
here
as
a
national
as
a
matter
of
right,
is
not
subject
to
the
exclusion
power,
and
finally,
we
believe,
is
still
a
national
of
the
united
states
and
not
an
alien.
in
any
event,
he
was
not
an
alien
when
he
arrived
here.
mr.
john
caughlan
within
that
time,
i
would
like
--
or
that
my
answer
is
clear
on
the
question
of
the
significance
of
this
proviso
which
reads,
"provided
further
that
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
also
apply
to
the
cases
of
aliens
who
come
to
the
main
land
from
the
insular
possessions."
the
question
was,
we're
the
filipinos
aliens?
that
was
the
question.
do
i
understand
correctly?
and
may
answer
--
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
right.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
is
the
question.
my
answer
to
that
was
posed
upon
the
entirety,
the
composite
of
all
the
statutes
as
they
applied
in
1951
when
this
conviction
took
place
as
i
must
treat
the
statute.
but
if
i
were
to
look
back
to
1931,
not
to
determine
what
the
statute
says
but
what
light
we
can
get
on
what
they
might
have
been
thinking
at
that
time,
what
they
considered
aliens
then.
of
course,
the
filipinos
at
that
time
were
not
aliens
but
that
leads
me
to
the
concluding
matter
which
i
cannot
stress
sufficiently.
that
between
that
time
and
the
time
that
the
offense
was
committed,
many
statutes
have
changed.
that's
why
we
were
passed
up
the
present
state
of
the
statutes,
and
most
particularly,
the
statutes
on
page
7
of
the
government's
brief,
the
filipino
independence
act
which
up
to
the
1946,
made
such
clear
provisions
that
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
which
we've
been
talking
about,
relating
to
the
immigration,
exclusion,
or
expulsion
--
may
i
finish
the
sentence?
mr.
john
caughlan
--
of
aliens,
the
citizens
--
the
citizens
of
the
philippine
islands
are
to
be
considered
as
if
they
were
aliens.
and
then
in
1946
--
that
is
further
down
on
page
7,
there
was
a
complete
sweep
divorcing
them
entirely
from
nationality
and
giving
them
certain
benefits
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
directed
attention
which
i
had
here
available.
so
that,
between
that
time
and
now,
there
were
these
statutes
which
completely
made
aliens
out
of
the
filipinos
so
that
as
of
1951,
when
this
conviction
took
place,
there's
no
question
about
their
being
aliens,
no
question
about
the
intent
of
the
congress
as
evidenced
by
all
these
statutes
taken
together
to
include
them
within
the
scope
and
to
deport.
mr.
john
caughlan
where?
mr.
john
caughlan
as
--
as
of
today,
definitely
yes.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
john
caughlan
today.
mr.
john
caughlan
mr.
chief
justice,
we'll
recall
at
the
outset
as
pointed
out
that
there
was
the
1937
--
one
status
and
there
is
the
present
status
which
controls
as
of
today.
i
will
answer
the
question
on
either
one
which
is
--
which
date
are
you
referring
to?
mr.
john
caughlan
thank
you.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
caughlan
absolutely
not.
it
is
controlled
--
mr.
john
caughlan
--
by
the
filipino
independence
act
which
we
have
set
forth
here.
mr.
john
caughlan
well,
i
--
mr.
john
caughlan
i
read
all
of
these
provisos
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
to
demonstrate
two
things
to
the
court.
one,
that
there
were
elements
of
manner
and
only
those
elements
of
manner
were
carried
out.
who
should
do
the
deporting
in
19,
where
they
should
go
to
in
20?things
like
that
but
that
these
provisos
that
were
not
pertinent,
that
were
only
pertinent
dependent
upon
the
rest
of
this
whole
complex
of
statues
that
in
those
cases,
the
pertinence
as
--
as
to
carry
over
was
wasn't
ill.
mr.
john
caughlan
they
were
not
matters
of
manner,
they
were
questions
of
who
shall
be
deported,
not
how
they
shall
be
deported,
and
as
such,
had
no
place
in
the
1931
act.
mr.
john
caughlan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
caughlan
this
was
it.
mr.
john
caughlan
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
john
caughlan
surely.
mr.
john
caughlan
[laughs]
mr.
john
caughlan
in
the
brief
or
the
separate
one?
mr.
john
caughlan
in
1917,
subject
only
to
the
amendments
of
the
reorganization
act
which
substituted
the
attorney
general
for
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
john
caughlan
it
reads
as
of
1917.
mr.
john
caughlan
at
that
time.
mr.
john
caughlan
and
that
slipped.
mr.
john
caughlan
or
he
was
not
alien
in
1970.
mr.
john
caughlan
that
preceded
the
a
whole
string
of
acts
which
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
later
but
notably,
i
must
hammer
again,
the
filipino
independence
act
which
specifically
said,
"they
were
to
be
treated
as
aliens
and
then
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
really
buttoned
it
up
in
1946,
when
they
were
completely
divorced
from
the
united
states.
mr.
john
caughlan
correctly,
correctly.
mr.
john
caughlan
in
1917
--
mr.
john
caughlan
very.
yes,
i
hope
i
made
that
clear.
