justice
john

i
believe
they
could

that
search
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
arrest
were
valid,
what
do
you
think
would
have
been
the
permissible
limits
of
the
search
if
any?
granted
the
validity
of
the
arrest
and
granted
what
follows
from
it
the
character
of
this
place
is
not
a
home
but
a
hideaway?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
get
--
getting
at
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
really
arguing
is
no
search
at
all
is
permissible
but
how
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
--
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
search
was
valid
as
an
incident
to
the
arrest,
do
you
think
it
became
invalid
because
they
try
to
go
over
the
stuff
and
examine
it
down
to
the
fbi
office?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
any
--
any
of
this
stuff
on
this
list
returned
to
these
defendants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
rest
of
these
stuff
is
still
on
possession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
did
the
trial
began
after
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
five
days
later.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
inferences
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
inferences,
i
should
think
that
mr.
green
put
it
over
and
rule
on
the
trial
and
so
whatever
is
going
to
be
used?
