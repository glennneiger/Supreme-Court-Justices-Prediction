justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
one
item
in
your
case
that
the
evidence
was
not
admissible
as
to
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
evidence
which
the
court
allowed
in
as
to
all
defendants
is
made
by
your
claim
that
it
should
have
been
restrictively
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
don't
see
what
--
what
your
other
claim
--
how
that
other
claims
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
invalidates
what
was
otherwise
admissible.
you
may
have
a
good
point
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
search
and
seizure.
now
on
constant,
is
there
an
admissibility?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
if
you'll
state
what
--
without
arguing
of
course,
what
the
claims
are
that
you're
making?
i
wouldn't
be
asking
specific
questions
such
as
whether
there's
any
complaint
about
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
should
have
in
alert
but
i
wasn't.
but
they
--
did
the
jury
bring
in
a
verdict
on
all
four
counts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
four
counts
survive
the
verdict
he
sentenced,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leonard,
are
the
pretrial
proceeding
before
trial
the
same
judge
has
subsequently
tried?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
unless
it
takes
too
much
to
give
me
some
dates.
the
arrests
were
early
in
august
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
did
they
come?
when
did
the
case
go
to
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
time
if
it
--
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
april
1954.
how
long
did
the
trial
take?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
weeks.
so
that
it
was
through
by
middle
of
may
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may.
and
when
did
it
get
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
trial
was
finished
in
april
of
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
facts
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
(inaudible)
what
appears
--
from
what
appears
on
213
as
i
have
no
more
to
go
on
in
that,
i
wonder
what
the
agent
can
point
out
the
general
things
i
had
observed.
again,
one
say
with
any
confidence
that
he
had
or
had
not
by
that
time
take
in
possession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
have
observed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
speaking
in
the
back
of
the
word
but
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
asked
for
instructions,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
had
the
government
on
that
but
as
one
entitled
to
infer
that
up
to
that
time,
he
had
not
taken
possession,
he
had
not
taken
in
control
because
he
wanted
to
get
instructions
whether
or
not
to
take
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
immaterial
to
one
of
the
pieces
as
i
do
about
these
questions,
namely,
if
there's
time
to
get
a
warrant,
he
should
get
a
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
at
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
during
--
during
--
during
ample
office
hours
with
any
administrative
officials
or
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judicial
officers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
what
is
the
result
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
permanent
u.s.
commissioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
stockton.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
on
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
expected
to
be
on
duty
also?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
something.
that
inventory
was
taken
by
whom
at
what
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
that
--
the
item
indicated
on
this
inventory
transcend
us
the
compendious
description
of
what
he
saw
on
page
213?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
realtor
couldn't
have
given
consent
to
articles
over
which
he
had
no
concern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
the
legality
of
the
search?
he
went
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
rule
on
relevance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
introduced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
in
that
wallet
was
introduced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
have
wallet
have
been
taking
on
an
appropriate
search
warrant
or
could
a
search
warrant
is
inappropriate
so
he
can
take
that
wallet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
assuming
--
assuming
the
evidence
was
relevant
and
my
question
presuppose
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
these
things
that
were
taken
under
the
implied
power
on
which
this
rest?
how
many
of
these
things
could
as
a
matter
could
have
been
seized
under
an
appropriate
search
warrant
or
could
there
have
been
an
appropriate
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
in
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
my
presupposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
either
the
u.s.
attorney
or
an
fbi
man
couldn't
have
gone
into
the
commissioner
at
stockton
and
said,
"please
sign
this
search
warrant
which
prepared
to
it.
take
all
articles
that
you
find
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
searches
seems
irrelevant
to
the
prosecution
of
the
case."
no
commissioner
in
his
sense
would
sign
such
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
if
an
officer
went
by
and
happened
to
go
by
and
saw
somebody
who
looked
like
a
fugitive
from
new
york,
(inaudible)
assuming
the
likeness,
the
kind
of
likeness
that
one
detects
that
people
would
know,
he
couldn't
make
an
arrest
then
and
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
about
the
people
whom
he
lived?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
person
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
find
living
in
this
--
in
this
(inaudible)
would
you
indicate
it
where
it
was
and
that
he
lived
with
them
on
terms
not
of
a
fellow
who
just
passed
where
he
was
but
seems
to
be
part
of
the
household.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
wasn't
an
inn
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
think
judge
learned
hand's
expression
of
that
opinion
is
the
law
of
this
--
is
the
law
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
some
up
sailing
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rummaging
of
drawers
in
a
room,
all
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
a
warrant
for
what
mr.
leonard?
warrant
for
the
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
--
but
this
argument
goes
on
the
assumption
that
the
arrest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
not
come
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
one
(inaudible)
to
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leonard
may
i
suggest
that
we're
not
as
much
at
large
being
on
what
has
been
decided.
we're
not
much
--
as
much
at
large
as
you
indicate
namely
we
got
nothing
to
go
on
except
just
to
have
atmospheric
smell
in
each
case.
that
isn't
the
situation
at
all
because
at
least
we
start
with
the
fact
that
any
taking
without
a
warrant
is
an
exception
to
a
constitutional
restriction
so
already
we're
not
at
large.
and
it's
up
to
the
government
to
justify
and
justify
very
heavily
that
this
was
necessary,
a
necessary
incident.
when
you
deal
with
incidents,
you
don't
deal
with
wholesale.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
you
was,
what
are
your
views
if
things
were
taken,
a
large
number
of
things,
everything
there,
such
as
that
that
were
wholly
immaterial,
irrelevant
couldn't
possibly
(inaudible)
what's
your
view
as
to
the
effect
of
that
on
the
whole
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
seizure
--
that's
the
seizure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
rule
includes
illegal
seizures
to
the
extent
that
they
go
far
beyond
what
they
authorize
--
where
they're
authorized
to
go
assuming
they
authorized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
rule
requires
that
all
of
it
be
held
inadmissible
every
pieces
of
things
--
everything
that
they
get?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
usually
live
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
misunderstand.
there
is
no
difference
or
is
there
between
you
and
the
government,
the
crime
of
harboring
is
that
it's
more
like
a
status
that
you
can
allege
an
offense
for
each
day
that
the
harboring
continues,
the
government
doesn't
make
any
such
claim,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
you
are
harboring
for
six
months,
there
is
no
difference
in
harboring
for
six
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
(inaudible)
on
page
68.
that
since
the
government
has
failed
in
his
view
through
the
case
of
harboring,
the
powers
of
contracting
a
conspiracy
problem
is
called
as
well.
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
he
--
how
can
he
mean
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
the
government
moved
for
trial
before
february?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
i
might.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maroney
of
course
i
don't
want
to
cut
in
to
your
argument
or
affect
your
notion
of
how
to
argue
it.
but
could
you
tell
me
whether
the
district
court
entertained
the
motion
as
timely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
canvass
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
don't
mean
the
affidavit
but
finally
when
the
pretrial
preceding
case
before
judge
goodman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
the
government
say
it
was
too
late?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
before
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
what
issue
was
that
testimony
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
puzzled.
i
don't
understand.
then
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
before
the
district
judge
before
the
trial
came
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
heard.
the
district
judge
entertained
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
testimony
was
heard.
i
don't
know
for
how
many
days
if
we
reach
page
230
and
he
didn't
rule
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
all
this
testimony
was
heard
and
then
it
evaporated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
soon
would
you
mind
that's
what
they
decide,
reading
about
dates
with
these
criminal
cases.
when
was
this
hearing,
there
was
sometimes
between
the
hearing
and
the
trial
on
the
merits
under
the
indictment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
trial
began?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
when
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
when
this
--
when
document
seized
or
other
object
seized
in
the
cabins
were
introduced
by
the
government,
was
there
objection
to
that
introduction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
intimation
that
the
things
that
we
pointed
out
in
the
second
(inaudible)
case
namely
timeliness
is
not
on
the
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
intimation
anywhere
that
that
was
the
basis
or
at
any
--
anything
in
the
record
from
which
one
could
infer
that
that's
why
judge
goodman
overruled
the
objection
of
testimony
because
of
illegal
seizure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
we
have
is
a
motion
to
suppress
because
of
the
fourth
amendment,
proceeding
pretrial
proceedings
in
due
course,
an
inconclusive
determination
so
far
as
any
--
any
judgment
of
the
record
goes,
is
that
right?
stipulation
whereby
the
case
went
off
the
calendar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reappearance
of
the
objection
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
your
argument
is
that
on
that
we
must
find
that
presumably
the
motion
wasn't
timed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
one
more
question,
mr.
maroney.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
the
substantive
issue
on
the
merits
of
the
search
and
seizure
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
there
make
the
contention
that
you
now
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
didn't
even
advert
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
they
went
to
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
difficult
for
me
to
believe
or
understand
that
a
hearing
was
held
on
the
same
day
that
a
motion
was
filed.
a
piece
of
paper
was
filed
at
the
clerk
to
the
district
court
on
monday,
april
5th,
and
that
judge
goodman
was
advised
of
it
and
he
said,
"all
right,
we'll
hear
this
motion
right
away"
and
the
witnesses
were
there,
maybe
that's
what
happen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
so
that
the
motion
was
before
the
court
and
it
was
called
for
hearing
on
monday
april
5th
and
6th
and
a
lot
of
testimony
was
taken
for
two
days
and
the
testimony
concluded
for
some
reason
or
concluded,
and
then
when
it
was
brought
up
again,
talk
about
the
rules
and
the
decisions
of
the
court.
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court
to
which
a
great
deal
of
attention
was
paid
because
of
its
importance
to
the
actual
conduct
of
the
trial
and
the
decision
afterwards
is
reflected
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
one
did
not
--
one
does
not
want
--
it
is
undesirable
to
break
the
trial
on
the
merits
with
the
subsidiary
no
vital
matter.
whereby
you
go
off
on
a
reason
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
the
rule
provide
on
the
basis
of
what
this
court
decided
that
the
motion
must
be
made
in
due
time
so
that
that
can
be
disposed
of
before
you
get
to
the
trial
in
order
that
the
trial
should
not
be
interrupted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
evidently
happened
here
because
unless
i'm
contrary
wise
informed
when
the
motion
was
renewed
as
it
has
to
be
renewed
at
the
trial
when
the
government
makes
offer.
there
was
a
quick
--
there
was
no
argument
about
it
and
that
judge
goodman
ruled
and
dispose
of
it
presumably
as
justice
brennan
suggest
presumably
on
what
had
happened
in
the
earlier
days.
i
mean,
it
fits
quite
in
with
the
whole
philosophy
or
the
purpose
of
the
rule
and
the
decision,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
already
suggested
what
--
that
the
house
itself
is
a
tool
so
that
if
you
could
quickly
put
it
on
wheels,
you
could
have
cut
that
off
in
order
to
put
in
evidence
that
the
lowliness
of
the
spot
which
this
was
found
and
the
doctrines
of
inaccessibility
et
cetera.
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
convening
to
be
ironic
that's
--
that's
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
take
all
and
then
select
what
is
useful,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maroney,
i
think
the
line
of
argument
that
you're
now
making
really
from
my
point
of
view
gets
to
the
bottom
of
this
problem
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
namely,
we
talk
about
reason,
unreason
as
though
we
examine
whether
from
the
point
of
view
of
conscientious,
high-minded,
if
you
will,
law
enforcing
officers.
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
--
for
all
i
know
you
and
i
would
have
done
it
--
i've
been
in
--
we've
been
in
their
places.
and
i
think
from
my
point
of
view
that's
the
vice
of
dealing
with
the
problem
in
that
way.
the
reasonableness
with
which
--
by
which
this
must
be
judged,
the
reasonableness
must
be
projected
against
the
fourth
amendment
which
presupposes
a
fixed
screw
of
requiring
a
warrant
--
a
search
warrant,
and
a
search
warrant
limited
very
specifically
and
subject
to
judicial
determination
to
which
there
are
these
very
narrow
exceptions
that
we
talk
about
and
you
talk
about
the
tools
of
the
crime
as
though
there's
some
principle
of
law
which
is
the
starting
point.
namely,
you
can
grab
everything
that
may
deemed
to
be
a
tool
of
a
crime.
i
can
see
that
could
be
a
wholly
misconceive,
misconception
on
the
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem.
you've
got
to
start
with
the
fact
that
it's
prohibited
and
that
the
exception
is
a
very
narrow
one,
an
extremely
narrow
one
which
had
it's
reason
--
and
reason
namely
you
want
--
for
the
safety
of
the
arresting
officers,
you
want
to
be
sure
that
they
haven't
got
a
pistol
of
what
not
or
a
knife
and
secondly
that
he
shouldn't
go
away
with
the
evidence.
now,
if
the
reasonableness
is
restricted
to
those
considerations,
then
we'll
get
a
proper
basis
from
which
to
judge
these
things
instead
of
considering
it,
whether
these
are
high-minded
in
inhumane
law
offices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
so
that's
the
logic
of
this
thing
that
you
can
do
more
without
a
warrant
than
with
a
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
if
that
is
true
that
you
concede
what
you've
searched.
those
are
two
different
things.
the
constitution
you
search
and
seizure,
there's
a
long
history
behind
that.
it
didn't
mean
you
can
carry
off
everything
you've
touched
and
found
out.
the
fact
that
you
may
search
something
doesn't
mean
thereby
you
can
search
and
seize
everything
you've
searched.
it
was
a
different
conception,
have
different
histories
and
different
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
in
the
cases
that
have
been
here,
the
court
hasn't
drawn
a
distinction
in
its
decision
between
seizure
and
search
once
they
found
that
the
search
was
lawful,
it
followed
that
seizure
was
all
right.
i
mean
it
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
not
been
made
in
the
case
that
had
been
disposed
of
here,
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
(inaudible)
but
i
mean
it
has
been
assumed
perhaps
on
the
fact
that
the
case
--
that
the
search
was
lawful
as
though
the
seizure
was
all
right.
it's
not
the
way
--
what
the
case
has
come
up
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
they
are
in
those
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about,
which
i
am
wholly
ignorant
you
surely
know.
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
statutory
provision
or
--
in
the
old
--
in
the
prohibition
days,
one
would
padlock
an
elicit
place.
is
there
any
general
provision
whereby,
in
a
situation
like
this,
you
would
have
a
comparable,
the
government
has
comparable
power
of
seeing
that
no
damage
is
done
or
that
no
intruder
has
come
in
and
see?
justice
felix
frankfurter
padlocking
in
this
prohibition
cases
is
a
special
statutory
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
counterfeiting
place.
suppose
the
government
raid
a
counterfeiting
place,
can
it
somehow
or
rather
safeguard
the
place
or
station
an
enforcing
officer,
the
secret
service,
i'm
talking
technically,
the
serviceman
outside?
well
never
mind,
i
thought
you
might
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
the
clerk
does
that,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
clerk
entry
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around
mr.
leonard,
it
appears
that
they
were
made
in
the
midst
of
the
trial.
