mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
may
it
please
the
court.
i
intend
to
get
to
the
search
and
seizure
question
without
undue
delay,
but
before
taking
up
that
point,
the
constitutional
questions
involved
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
some
facts
of
the
case,
the
evidentiary
facts
which
i
feel
should
be
born
in
mind
with
proper
consideration
of
the
legal
issues.
and
to
discuss
an
argument
put
forth
by
the
government
to
the
effect
that
we
do
not
feel
this
court
should
reach
the
constitutional
questions,
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
been
raised
by
petitioner's
brief.
now,
first
with
respect
to
some
of
the
facts
which
were
developed
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
and
these
facts
are
set
forth
--
the
facts
that
i
am
referring
to
are
set
forth
on
our
brief
from
pages
6
through
10.
i'm
just
going
to
refer
briefly
to
some
of
those
facts.
the
evidence
showed
that
thompson,
steinberg,
ross
and
coleman
were
all
long-time
into
this.
they
all
had
offices
in
the
same
building
at
communist
party
headquarters
in
new
york
city.
on
june
20,
1953,
approximately
two
months
prior
to
the
arrest
in
the
case.
petitioner
kremen
using
the
false
and
fictitious
name
of
mrs.
lee
kaplan
rented
the
cabin
here
involved
in
twain
harte.
she
told
the
real
estate
broker
at
the
time
of
making
the
lease
that
she
desired
the
cabin
for
her
sick
brother.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
petitioner
kremen,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
evidence
showed
that
petitioner
steinberg
identified
himself
to
the
owner
of
the
cabin
as
mr.
newberg
and
he
referred
to
mrs.
kremen
as
his
sister.
of
course
the
evidence
reflects
that
petitioner
steinberg
not
only
is
not
the
brother
of
mrs.
kremen
but
he
was
not
ill.
mrs.
kremen
said
at
the
time
of
negotiating
for
rental
of
the
premises
that
she
liked
the
cabin
because
it
was
quiet
and
out
of
the
way.
the
evidence
also
show
that
the
petitioner
steinberg
seem
to
be
the
host
or
master
of
the
cabin.
on
one
occasion,
he
ordered
mrs.
kremen
to
pay
a
light
bill
to
the
owner
of
the
cabin
mr.
germany.
petitioner
kremen
made
several
purchases,
a
large
quantities
of
food
from
which
an
inference
to
be
drawn
that
the
food
was
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
the
two
fugitives
and
the
other
people
at
the
cabin.
on
one
occasion,
she
and
a
male
companion
attempted
to
purchase
hair
dye,
and
in
this
connection,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
mr.
thompson
at
the
time
of
his
apprehension
had
dyed
red
hair
and
a
dyed
mustache.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
on
june
5,
1953
also
about
two
months
prior
to
the
arrest
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
coleman
using
the
false
and
fictitious
name
or
william
gordon
purchased
a
hudson
automobile
in
missouri.
and
at
the
time
of
purchase,
he
explained
that
he
needed
the
automobile
in
a
hurry
for
a
vacation.
the
keys
to
this
automobile
were
found
in
thompson's
pocket
when
he
was
apprehended.
on
july
4th,
coleman
still
using
the
name
of
gordon
and
thompson
were
members
of
a
party
of
four
which
rented
boats
at
a
resort
in
bigfork,
montana,
oh
i'm
sorry,
in
camdenton,
missouri.
and
during
the
early
part
of
august,
thompson
purchased
a
fishing
license
in
bigfork,
montana
using
the
false
name
of
j.f.
brennan.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
the
evidence
showed
that
he
was
in
possession
of
various
identification
cards,
i
think
12
cards
of
different
types,
social
security
cards,
fishing
licenses
and
things
to
that
sort
under
the
false
name
of
john
f.
brennan.
there
was
nothing
on
his
person
at
the
time
of
the
arest,
nothing
in
the
cabin
to
indicate
that
true
identity
of
thompson
or
of
steinberg.
both
of
them
were
using
fictitious
names
as
were
petitioners
coleman
and
mrs.
kremen.
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
also,
both
thompson
and
petitioner
steinberg
had
altered
their
physical
appearances.
the
evidence
showed
that
thompson
had
dyed
his
hair
red.
he
had
gain
much
weight,
had
grown
a
mustache
and
that
the
mustache
also
was
dyed.
petitioner
steinberg
had
cut
his
hair
short.
he
had
also
grown
a
mustache
and
was
much
thinner.
the
evidence
seized
in
the
cabin
also
show
that
petitioner
kremen's
purse
contain
various
documents,
means
of
identification
in
the
name
of
mrs.
lee
kaplan.
there
was
no
indication
reflecting
that
the
owner
of
the
purse
mrs.
kremen
actually
was
mrs.
kremen.
now,
going
from
that
very
brief
outline
of
some
of
the
evidence,
it
is
our
contention
first
that
this
court
should
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
raised
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
petitioners
here
were
arrested
in
august
of
1953.
in
september
of
1953
mrs.
kremen
claimed
some
of
the
property
that
was
seized
at
the
cabin
and
that
property
was
returned
to
her.
i
think
it
was
referred
to
during
the
course
of
petitioner's
argument
and
it
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief.
i
think
beginning
at
page
19.
there
is
a
notation
that
the
following
items
were
identified
by
mrs.
kremen
and
returned
to
her
on
september
25
and
those
items
consume
four
and
a
half
pages
of
the
appendix.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
no
motion
was
made
by
any
of
the
petitioners
for
the
return
of
any
of
this
property
or
the
suppression
of
the
property
until
february
4,
1954,
over
six
months
after
the
arrest.
and
in
this
connection,
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
of
course
all
the
petitioners
were
present
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
here
involved.
all
the
petitioners
were
present
at
the
time
of
the
seizures
here
involved.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
certain,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
will,
your
honor
and
i
wouldn't
certainly
rely
on
that
fact.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
mean
in
my
--
in
my
argument.
i'm
not
sure.
i
wouldn't
be
certain.
now,
this
february
4
motion
was
the
motion
for
the
return
of
property
and
the
supression
of
the
property
as
evidence.
it
was
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
of
petitioner
steinberg
in
which
he
merely
ask
for
the
return
of
the
property
seized
between
hard
cabin
on
august
27,
1953,
the
date
of
the
arrest.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
motion?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
set
forth
in
volume
1
of
the
record
on
pages
18
and
19.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
at
--
at
--
on
the
occasion
of
this
motion
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
court
did
entertained
it
as
timely
and
denied
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sorry,
no
sir.
he
denied
on
the
basis
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
pretrial
proceedings,
no,
sir.
but
the
motion
that
was
entertained
by
judge
goodman
that
i
think
is
involved
here
and
a
hearing
was
held
thereon.
that
motion
was
set
off
the
calendar
by
stipulation
of
counsel.
there
was
no
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
stipulation
or
what
caused
the
stipulation.
the
record
merely
shows
that
there
was
a
hearing
before
judge
goodman,
the
special
agent
mr.
(inaudible)
who
was
in
charge
of
the
arrest
party
testified
as
to
certain
circumstances
surrounding
the
arrests
and
surrounding
the
seizures.
mrs.
germany
testified
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
was
before
the
trial.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
the
question
on
whether
--
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
didn't
rule
on
it
because
it
was
set
off
the
calendar
by
stipulation
of
counsel.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
and
the
record
does
not
show
in
any
way
the
nature
of
the
stipulation,
the
purpose
of
the
stipulation
or
anything
else
except
in
--
pardon
me.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
except
insofar
is
it
obviously
mooted
the
hearing
before
judge
goodman
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
this
hearing
was
on
april
5,
i
believe,
at
least
approximately
that
date.
and
it
was
set
off
the
calendar
i
think
on
april
6.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
trial
began
on
april
12.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
--
there
was
objection
on
the
ground
that
the
documents
have
been
illegally
secured,
the
motion
was
denied
or
not
the
motion,
the
objection
was
overruled
by
judge
goodman
without
explanation.
so
that
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
he
overruled
it
because
he
was
not
going
to
interrupt
the
criminal
trial
at
that
point
or
further
exploration
into
the
validity
of
the
search
and
seizure
or
whether
he
had
made
a
determination
of
some
kind
of
his
own
find.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
record
from
which
we
could
infer
that
that
was
his
basis.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
only
in
the
docket
entries.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
set
off
the
calendar,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
it's
an
expression
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
sure
that
the
term
has
that
precise
usage,
your
honor.
for
example,
i
am
familiar
with
the
fact
that
in
a
trial
or
a
case
that
is
set
for
trial
at
a
certain
date.
sometimes
the
court
will
order
that
the
case
set
off
the
calendar.
in
other
words,
there
won't
be
any
date
set
for
calling
the
case.
there
will
be
just
be
an
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
indefinite
suspension.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
would
take
from
it.
the
defendants
have
made
this
motion.
there's
been
hearing,
there
has
been
a
--
a
testimony
taken
in
connection
with
the
motion.
it
is
prior
to
trial
that
if
the
defendants
desired
a
ruling
of
the
court,
they
certainly
could
have
gotten
the
ruling
of
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
or
should
have
been
suppressed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
there
is
--
there
is
(voice
overlap)
they
made
a
motion.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
fact
--
i'll
only
draw
their
inference
from
the
fact
that
judge
goodman
took
testimonies
prior
to
trial.
assume
he
wouldn't
have
taken
testimony
had
he
not
intended
to
rule
what
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
it's
only
a
minute
entry
your
honor.
it's
a
docket
entry
that
i
have
reference
to
which
dispose
--
shows
the
only
disposition
of
that
--
that
hearing.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
april
5,
it
is
on
page
73
of
volume
1,
your
honor.
april
5,
hearing
on
motion
to
return
seized
property
order
continued
to
april
6
for
further
hearing.
april
6
by
stipulation
of
counsel
order
a
motion
off
or
motions
off
calendar
and
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
at
any
later
time
as
to
that
motion.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
trial
began
on
april
12.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
and
--
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
this
might
have
some
bearing
on
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
a
different
motion.
on
april
12,
there
was
a
hearing
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
i
think
the
trial
was
interrupted,
if
i
recall
correctly
on
a
motion
by
the
defendant
patricia
blau
who
was
acquitted
to
suppress
the
property
seized
at
the
time
of
her
arrest.
now,
that
is
a
completely
different,
separate
arrest
from
the
arrest
here
involved
in
this
court.
she
was
arrested
in
an
automobile
five
or
six
hours
after
this
arrest.
and
the
motion
on
april
12
and
the
evidence
that
was
taken
on
april
12
pertained
to
the
motion
by
patricia
blau.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
there
are
motions
for
mistrial,
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
a
motion
on
ground
of
surprise
(inaudible).
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
i
see.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
docket
entry
would
make
it
seem
so
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
--
this
point
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
did
not.
they
ruled,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
there
was
a
valid
arrest
and
a
valid
search
and
seizure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
now,
briefly
to
just
complete
the
basis
of
our
argument
without
going
into
too
much
further
detail,
at
the
time
the
first
motion
was
made,
there
was
no
claim
of
ownership
by
the
petitioners
by
--
they
move
unto
steinberg.
the
court
in
denying
the
motion
said
that
you
have
to
claim
ownership.
you
have
to
claim
a
possessory
interest
in
order
to
have
standing
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
the
court
said,
"i'll
require
the
government
to
give
you
a
list,
this
appendix.
the
inventory
of
the
matters
that
were
seized
so
that
you
can
come
in
and
protect
your
motion."
but
this
was
furnished
by
the
government,
no
petition
ever
came
in
on
a
motion
to
suppress
or
a
motion
for
return
of
the
property,
claimed
any
of
the
property
and
on
that
basis,
on
the
basis
that
was
illegally
seized
ask
for
its
return.
now,
and
i
think
that
although
i
don't
know
of
any
case
which
has
been
decided
squarely
by
this
court
that
that
is
the
law
in
all
the
(inaudible).
and
i
think
it
is
set
forth
with
precision
by
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
oh
--
well,
ownership
or
a
possession.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
--
that's
correct.
our
position
is
that
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
should
be
made
before
trial.
the
rules
so
provide,
the
judicial
decisions
both
of
this
court
and
of
circuits
so
provide
the
purpose
being.
so
that
if
there
has
been
an
invalid
seizure
and
if
it
would
be
useless
to
go
to
the
expense
and
trouble
of
conducting
a
trial,
getting
in
the
middle
of
it
and
--
and
having
a
determination
that
certain
evidence
was
illegally
secured
and
therefore
the
government
couldn't
continue,
all
that
could
be
obligated
through
the
proper
procedure,
the
procedure
setup
in
the
rules
by
judicial
decisions
to
take
care
of
that
collateral
matter
prior
to
trial
and
i
think
that's
the
decision.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
--
that's
right
sir.
the
court
may
entertain
the
motion
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
hear
it
going
to
trial,
i
don't
believe.
in
other
words,
the
only
occasion
when
the
motion
here
in
anyway
arose
during
the
trial
was
in
the
form
of
an
objection
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
--
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
it
depends
on
how
that
minute
entry
is
construed.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
motion
prior
to
trial
which
went
to
a
hearing
was
set
off
the
calendar
by
stipulation
of
counsel
after
the
testimony
was
taken.
the
defendants
then,
the
petitioners
here
did
not
pursue
it
to
a
judgment
of
the
court.
now,
i've
read
that
this
minute
entry
makes
it
appear
that
it
was
possible
that
on
april
13
and
after
entertaining
the
additional
motion
of
patricia
blau
or
to
suppress,
that
the
fact
that
it
refers
to
motions,
mos
period,
it
might
be
taken
as
an
indication
the
(voice
overlap)
their
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
there
--
the
defendants
in
the
case
had
a
great
length
of
time
to
their
motions
in
proper
forum.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
april
5?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
a
new
motion
by
petitioner
kremen.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
except
insofar
as
the
documentaries
reflect
that
it
was
set
off
the
account.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
could
possibly
be
drawn,
your
honor,
i
think
certainly
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
certainly
unclear.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i'd
be
delighted,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
would
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
motion
was
filed
on
march
26?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
think
it
normally
would
happen
in
that
way.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
may
i
merely
refer
in
connection
with
that
first
argument
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
to
the
three
cases,
three
additional
cases
which
i
like
to
call
for
the
attention
of
the
court
and
which
i
asked
the
clerk
to
furnished
copies
to
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search,
the
arrests
involved
in
the
case
is
our
contention,
all
were
valid
arrests.
the
arrest
of
thompson
and
steinberg
were
pursuant
to
warrant
issued
some
two
years
earlier.
at
the
time
of
making
the
arrest
of
the
other
three
persons
found
in
the
cabin,
the
arresting
officers
had
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
felony
was
being
committed
in
their
presence.
now,
they
did
not
have
that
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
felony
was
being
committed
until
approximately
12:30,
35
minutes
prior
to
the
arrest.
i
mentioned
that
in
connection
with
petitioner's
argument
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
this
long
surveillance
and
certain
activities
occurring
the
day
before
and
so
forth
on
the
part
of
the
bureau
that
there
was
time
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
for
these
other
three
people.
but
that
is
not
so,
because
there
was
no
positive
identification
by
the
arresting
agents
that
thompson,
the
person
at
the
cabin
was
actually
the
thompson
that
they
were
looking
for
or
that
steinberg
was
the
man
they
were
looking
for.
both
of
them
were
disguised
as
we
previously
mentioned.
and,
so
that
35
minutes
prior
to
the
arrest,
they
did
have
knowledge
that
these
two
people
were
fugitives.
from
the
observations
personally
made
by
the
arresting
officers
the
day
before
and
on
the
day
of
the
arrests
from
the
activities
and
relationship
of
the
three
people
in
the
cabin
to
the
two
people
for
whom
they
were
warrants,
the
two
fugitives.
the
officers
had
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
those
other
three
people
were
harboring
thompson
and
steinberg.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
believe
some
fiver
or
six
agents
were
at
the
cabin
at
5
or
6
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
arrest.
and
that
the
other
agents
arrived
in
cars
at
about
the
time
of
the
arrest.
in
other
words,
they
drove
up
and
drove
into
the
premises
and
maybe
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
by
--
apparently,
by
arrangements
made
through
communication
by
walkie-talkie
during
the
course
of
the
morning.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
they
left
san
francisco
that
morning
which
is
some
hundred
miles
i
believe
from
twain
harte.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
about
60,
yes,
sir.
and
the
positive
identification
was
made
at
12:30,
approximately
12:30.
the
arrest
were
made
at
1:04
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
so
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
that
--
that
is
so.
and
it
would
seem
from
the
time
of
--
that
they
--
at
the
time
of
the
positive
identification
were
probably
20
or
30
miles
from
there.
now
they
--
they
were
in
route.
they
could
have
been
in
the
city
of
twain
harte.
they
could
have
been
only
three
or
four
miles
away,
the
record
doesn't
make
that
clear.
the
point
we
make
is
that
there
was
only
some
(inaudible)
between
the
point
of
the
positive
identification
and
the
making
of
the
arrests
and
have
these
two
fugitives,
the
agents
were
confronted
with
a
situation
in
a
remote
cabin,
remote
place
where
there
were
two
fugitives
who
had
been
at
large
for
over
two
years.
and
i
think
to
require
the
arresting
officers
to
go
get
a
warrant
for
the
other
three
people
would
not
be
permitting
two
arresting
officers
the
degree
of
latitude
which
i
think
this
court
has
held
should
be
accorded
to
persons
who
are
daily
in
combat
so
to
speak
with
the
criminals.
it
would
be
unrealistic
it
seems
to
me
to
require
an
officer
coming
across
a
situation
such
as
this
to
go
60
miles
or
so
to
get
a
warrant
before
he
makes
the
arrest.
the
arrest
--
the
crime
of
harboring,
reasonably
and
probably
according
to
their
observations
were
being
committed
in
their
presence.
and
they
had
a
right
to
determine
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
when
to
close
the
traffic.
now,
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances
and
in
light
of
the
information
known
to
the
arresting
officers,
the
arrests
in
this
case
were
valid
arrest
based
on
reasonable
and
probable
cause.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
old
case
of
stacey
v.
emery.
the
circumstances
known
to
the
officers
must
be
such
as
to
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
caution
to
believe
or
to
entertain
an
honest
and
strong
suspicion
that
the
person
is
guilty.
certainly,
from
what
the
officers
knew
here,
they
could
entertain.
they
believe
the
reasonable,
honest
and
strong
suspicion
that
these
other
three
people
at
the
cabin
who
had
been
there
all
night,
who
had
not
arrived
in
the
cabin
early
in
the
morning
who
were
obviously
living
with
these
two
people
were
haroring
those
two
people.
now,
then
to
the
--
going
next
from
the
proposition
that
the
arrests
were
valid,
this
court
has
held
that
pursuant
to
an
incidental
to
an
arrest,
to
a
valid
arrest,
the
person
who
was
arrested
and
the
place
where
he
is
arrested
may
be
searched
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime,
the
tools
of
the
crime
or
for
weapons,
contraband
and
like
matter.
now,
i
think
it
has
been
covered
the
nature
of
the
evidence
that
was
seized.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
tools
of
this
crime
i
think
as
the
evidence
here
amply
demonstrates
and
i
think
as
reasonable
to
suspect,
to
suppose
is
false
identification
in
each.
actually,
harboring
being
the
type
of
crime
it
is.
the
--
the
very
essence
of
the
crime
depends
on
putting
up
an
appearance
to
the
casual
observer
so
as
to
avoid
suspension.
to
appear
to
be
engaging
in
innocent
activity,
to
protect
the
true
identity
of
the
person
who
was
being
harbored,
to
clothe
that
person,
to
feed
him,
to
provide
him
with
the
ordinary
necessities
of
life.
i
think
that
in
essence
is
a
harboring
case.
and
i
think
that
from
the
very
nature
of
the
crimes,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
there
would
be
those
tools
of
the
crime
so
to
speak
present
in
the
premises.
there
would
be
false
identification
cards,
social
security
cards,
driver's
licenses.
there
would
be
the
cryptic
notes
such
as
were
found
by
the
officers
in
their
search
here,
obviously
meant
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating,
clandestine
meetings
with
other
people
who
may
have
been
involved
in
the
harboring
enterprise.
technically,
i
think
in
a
very
little
sense,
the
cabin
it
self
was
a
primary
tool
of
the
harboring
process.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
functions
of
harboring
someone
is
to
provide
him
with
a
place
to
stay
at
least
where
he
can
feel
at
least
secured,
a
place
where
he
can
be
fed
and
so
forth.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
in
describing
the
tools
of
harboring
offenses,
it's
difficult
to
draw
a
line.
i
would
like
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
pair
of
socks,
a
pair
of
shoes,
at
least
all
of
the
shoes
that
were
taken
in
this
seizure
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
were
tools.
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
wash
rags
and
things
of
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
the
records?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
certainly
it
is
essential
to
harboring
someone,
to
provide
necessities
of
life.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
what
was
that
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir
i
--
we
--
we
don't
make
the
contention,
we
don't
make
the
contention.
i
was
merely
previously
making
an
argument
that
the
tools
of
the
harboring
offense
are
dissimilar
to
the
tools
of
most
offenses.
in
a
--
in
a
robbery
case,
the
tools
of
the
crime
or
a
gun
or
something
to
that
sort
and
in
narcotics,
it
is
morphine
or
cocaine.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we
--
we
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
--
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
we
attempt
to
justify
the
seizure
of
all
this
material
on
a
basis
of
the
material
all
being
tools
of
the
offense.
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that.
my
discussion
earlier
was
that
in
a
harboring
offense,
a
unique
type
of
crime,
the
tools
of
the
offense
often
are
innocent
appearing
things
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
we
justify
or
attempt
to
justify
a
seizure
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
think
as
tools
of
the
crime
that
none
of
the
items
that
your
honor
has
just
read,
we
don't
claim
that
they
were
taken
as
tools
to
crime.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
i
--
if
i
might
summarize
what
i
think
were
properly
taken
as
tools
of
the
crime
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
would
say
the
matters
that
were
offered
in
evidence,
the
false
social
security
cards,
driver's
licenses,
matters
of
that
kind,
things
which
is
established
or
tended
to
--
were
meant
to
establish
a
separate
identity
of
the
people
who
were
being
harbored
and
who
were
doing
the
harbor.
they,
i
think
were
definite
tools
of
the
crime.
during
the
search
there
was
some
matters
--
there
were
some
matters
which
were
seized
as
evidence.
and
i
think
that
where
a
proper
search
is
being
conducted
and
evidence
is
run
across
that
that
evidence
can't
be
seized.
now,
as
to
the
seizure
of
these
remaining
items,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
agent
that
the
purpose
of
taking
all
these
materials,
all
these
things
that
belong
to
the
defendants
was
part
of
it
for
the
purpose
of
tools
of
the
crime
and
the
other
part
for
some
evidentiary
value,
but
the
bulk
of
the
material
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding.
here
was
a
cabin
in
a
remote
place.
all
the
items
of
the
cabin
were
being
taken
away
to
san
francisco,
120
miles
away.
it
was
a
ready
camp.
similar,
i
gather
to
--
to
a
cottage
at
a
beach,
this
was
a
resort
now,
this
was
a
cottage
that
apparently
was
rented
in
the
summer
months.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
possibly
there
would
be
--
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
an
obligation
to
safeguard
it
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
there
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
safeguard
material?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
do
not.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
i
--
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor
don't
know
of
any
case
where
the
circumstances
as
presented
here
were
present.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think
this
court
has
--
has
stated
time
and
time
again
that
each
case
must
--
must
depend,
must
be
decided
when
you're
considering
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
the
reasonableness
to
seizure.
(voice
overlap)
--
must
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
depend
on
his
own
peculiar
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
may
i
say
this,
your
honor
that
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
offense,
the
circumstances
under
which
the
arrests
were
made
and
whether
as
an
incident
to
that
arrest,
it
was
proper
to
go
through
this
house
and
to
search
for
the
fruits
--
for
the
tools
of
the
crime.
now
if
it
was
proper
to
make
that
search,
and
i
think
it
was
and
i
think
that
--
that
it
can
be
sustained
under
the
--
under
the
harris
case
and
under
the
rabinowitz
case.
that
the
fact
that
some
materials
were
taken
away
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
perhaps
we're
not
subject
to
the
seizure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
was
any
malice
here,
any
other
disregard
shown
by
the
officers.
i
think
the
officers
in
this
case
showed
a
considerable
--
interest
in
the
people.
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
they
were
considerate
of
their
immediate
wants,
they
--
they,
the
people
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
were
all
in
sports
clothes,
they
were
leaving
this
resort
going
to
san
francisco,
each
of
them
was
permitted
to
go
back
into
the
house
to
select
whatever
clothing
he
desired
for
--
for
the
trip
to
the
city.
he
was
--
they
were
permitted
to
or
they
were
asked
whether
there
were
any
valuables
in
the
premises
belonging
to
them
that
--
of
a
personal
nature
or
of
a
valuable
nature.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
this
court
in
the
harris
case
ruled
that
whether
it
was
a
valid
arrest,
the
place
can
be
searched
for
the
tools
of
the
crime.
now
in
the
harris
case,
of
course
the
defendant
was
being
arrested
on
a
warrant
or
i
think
the
transportation
in
the
interstate
commerce
of
fraudulent
document
--
some
--
some
such
offense
as
that.
and
he
was
arrested
in
the
living
room.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
the
basis
of
searching
for
false
identification
cards,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
could
have
been
a
warrant
for
--
to
take
all
these
materials.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
the
logic
i
think
is
this
that
--
that
--
we
come
first
to
the
question,
was
the
search
reason
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now
could
they
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
know
no
case
where
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
all
the
evidence
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
this
that
it
--
if
it
was
reasonable
on
the
first
instance
to
go
through
this
property,
to
look
at,
to
examine,
to
take
what
was
a
tool
of
the
crime
or
the
fruit
of
the
crime.
the
fact
that
more
was
taken
than
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
should
not
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
when
you
say
wholly
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
material
that
was
taken
in
addition
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
know
of
no
case
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
ruled
on
a
case
where
certain
material
was
seized.
and
there
was
a
determination
that
the
search
was
reasonable
but
there's
more
--
or
that
certain
items
were
taken
which
should
not
have
been
taken.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
which
made
it
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
being
a
reasonable
search.
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
--
that
they
--
they
may
have
seized
articles
which
they
should
not
have
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
say
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
those
articles
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
safeguarding
all
of
their
properties
here.
there
was
--
there
was
money,
take
the
money
for
example.
there
was
--
there
was
over
$2000
i
believe
that
was
taken
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
now,
surely
that
money
shouldn't
have
been
left
lying
around.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
--
it's
reasonable
and
when
considered
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
done.
it's
like
--
it's
like
making
an
arrest
of
a
person
and
i
think
it's
customary
to
take
--
to
take
the
money
way
from
the
person
than
to
hold
it
while
he's
in
jail.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
--
as
i
say,
your
honor
i
can't
give
you
a
case.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
it
has
arisen.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
some
things
may
have
been
or
the
court
maybe
of
the
opinion
that
some
things
were
illegally
seized
or
unlawfully
seized
should
affect
the
admissibility
of
the
materials
which
were
doubtedly
seized
pursuant
to
a
valid
and
reasonable
search.
i
mean
that
--
that's
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
make
that
the
--
the
search
here
was
reasonable.
under
these
circumstances
they
could
go
through
this
house.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
so
with
respect
to
the
material
that
was
properly
the
subject
of
the
search
warrant
and
properly
seized
there
under.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
--
i've
tried
to
read
a
great
many
of
the
cases
and
i
know
--
i
don't
know
of
any
situation
where
the
question
has
turned
after
a
consideration
or
after
a
finding
that
a
search
was
reasonable,
that
the
seizure
was
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
usually
the
case
is
turned
on
the
question
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
--
that
is
searched.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
would
think
not,
that
way.
i
think
this
--
this
is
a
little
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
because
--
because
here,
i
think
under
the
cases
of
this
court
harris,
rabinowitz,
the
search
was
reasonable.
they
had
a
right
to
go
through
the
house,
they
right
to
--
to
review
this
material
and
to
take
whatever
was
proper
to
take.
the
fact
that
other
material
may
have
been
taken
should
not
render
that
valid
search
invalid.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
so.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
distinction?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
don't
think
it
has
been
made.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
think
so,
but
i
think
that
all
those
cases
of
course
are
distinguishable
on
the
facts
that
are
presented
by
this
case
by
--
by
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
see
that
my
time
was
just
about
up
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
know
of
any
such
provision,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
know
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
maybe
a
provision
to
that
on
those
special
statutes
such
as
--
from
the
(inaudible)
and
things
of
that
sort.
