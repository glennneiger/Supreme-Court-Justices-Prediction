yes.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
discretionary
over
the
court
that
will
hear
it?
unknown
speaker
and
heard
it
here?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
on
the
february
9th
(inaudible)
the
defendants
must
return
(inaudible)
denied.
so
he
denied
at
that
time
and
gave
them
time
to,
i
suppose,
for
you
to
get
the
list.
unknown
speaker
then
it
came
out
on
april
13.
that's
the
day
after
the
trial
began
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
hearing
almost
suppress
after
argument
he
said
motions
--
i
suppose
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
which
was
already
denied.
so
he
denied
it
then,
did
he?
that
was
before
any
evidence
was
offered.
