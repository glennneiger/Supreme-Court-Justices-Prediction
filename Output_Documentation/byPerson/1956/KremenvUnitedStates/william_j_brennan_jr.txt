what
--
what
--
what
part
of
this
was
used
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
--
how
--
how
can
you
ask
us
to
infer
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
oh
apparently
the
motion
was
filed,
right?
a
motion
was
filed
after
the
disposition
of
the
february
9
motion.
that's
implicit,
isn't
it,
in
the
april
5
minute
that
there
was
another
motion.
it's
a
new
motion
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
now
then,
that
being
so,
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
while
it
was
filed,
it
was
not
disposed
of
before
the
trial,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
something
was
done
on
april
13th
from
which
the
inference
i
suppose.
i
think
you
concede
maybe
drawn
that
that
motion
first
heard
on
april
5
is
one
of
the
motions
disposed
of
in
april
13.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
could
possibly.
i
mean
how
--
how
can
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
ask
us
to
draw
a
(inaudible)
your
whole
argument
of
this
point
you're
now
making
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
say
that
the
motion
maybe,
have
been
made
before
a
trial
but
wasn't
disposed
of
it,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
better
get
on
to
your
next
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
far
away
were
the
agents
who
joined
the
five
or
six
already
at
the
cabin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
i
understand
stockton
where
the
commissioner
has
his
quarters
was
about
50
miles
away?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
do
we
--
do
we
understand
that
these
agents
coming
from
san
francisco
were
on
route
before
the
positive
identification
was
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
say
that
all
of
the
items
listed
here
is
taken
all
into
one
or
the
other
of
the
categories
you've
given
them?

william
j.
brennan,

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
government
have
any
obligation
to
safeguard
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
maroney.
if
you
had
gone
before
a
commissioner
or
these
officers
rather
had
gone
before
a
commissioner
on
the
usual
affidavit,
how
could
they
possibly
have
justified
an
application
for
a
warrant
authorizing
to
do
what
they
did
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
commissioner
would
have
issued
a
warrant
which
authorize
the
taking
of
all
their
clothes,
all
their
food?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
their
toothbrushes
and
all
the
other
things?
