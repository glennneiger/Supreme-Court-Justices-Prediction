what
was
done
by
them
--
you
mean
they
took
it
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
these
list?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
seizure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
seizure
goes
far
beyond
anything
that
could
possibly
be
needed,
does
that
have
any
effect
or
could
you
say
that
the
seizure
of
the
things
that
it
might
have
been
able
to
get
would
still
be
valid
although
they
have
gone
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
what
should
have
been
seized?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
here
the
government
doesn't
contend
that
there
was
any
possible
basis
for
taking
some
of
these
things
like
hair
brushes,
hair
tonic,
lipstick,
things
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
this
stipulation
in
the
record
that
it
should
go
off
the
calendar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you
mean
by
set
off
the
record?
that's
a
new
expression
to
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
set
off
the
calendar.
you
mean
by
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
was
stipulated
that
they
would
take
it
off
the
calendar
or
does
that
mean
that
they
would
take
it
off
to
calendar
and
agreed
that
it
should
not
be
ruled
off.
what
does
it
mean
the
word
"set
off
the
calendar"
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
don't
have
a
date
anyhow
on
the
calendar
for
rendering
a
judgment,
that's
what
i
meant.
you
--
what
--
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
it's
stipulated
that
the
hearing
that
they
were
in
ruling
could
be
taken
--
just
--
just
continue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
submit,
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
you
rely
on
to
show
that
to
be
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
any
rule
on
but
in
somehow
they
waived
or
somewhat.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
agreement
in
here
that
he
should
not
rule?
is
there
any
stipulation
to
that
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
what

justice
hugo

and
further
here
on
motion
to
suppress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
suppose
we
oath
to
be
able
to
assume
gentlemen
that
the
government
--
that
the
government
really
had
proved
that
they
stipulated
in
some
way
to
abandon
their
motion
that
the
government
would
show
it
to
us
and
then
ask
us
to
infer.
something
happened
there
with
reference
to
the
stipulation.
the
government
knows
what
it
was
and
i
should
think
if
they're
going
to
ask
us
to
say
that
they
abandon
their
motion,
they
have
to
disprove
to
that
effect.
somewhat
corrected
or
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
be
the
fruits
or
the
tools
of
this
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to,
if
you
would
argue
on
a
little
different
basis
on
what
you
have.
assuming
--
assuming
that
this
was
a
reasonable
search
as
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out,
it
was
different.
i
haven't
heard
anything
you
said,
it
indicated
that
you
could
argue
or
would
argue
that
it
was
a
reasonable
seizure.
now
there
are
plenty
of
our
cases
upheld
i
suppose
--
maybe
find
--
you
find
support
for
your
search.
but
do
you
find
any
support
in
any
case
the
courts
have
written
for
a
seizure
like
this
as
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
if
it
is
an
unreasonable
seizure,
do
you
think
our
cases
require
that
they
have
to
(inaudible).
are
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing
that
even
though
it
is
wholly
unreasonable
seizure,
that
you
can
pick
out
certain
parts
of
it
and
offer
them
because
it
would
have
been
reasonable
had
you
limited
it
to
that.
what
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
is
your
argument
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
make
it
an
unreasonable
seizure
--
what
do
you
say
if
it
has
to
be
concluded
that
it
was
a
wholly
unreasonable
seizure
as
i
may
say
it
seems
to
me,
it's
no
answer
to
that
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
--
all
these
things
that
stripped
the
house
of
the
toothpaste
and
the
toothbrushes
and
everything
on
that
and
the
clothes.
assuming
now
that
that's
an
unreasonable
seizure,
do
you
argue
that
you
could
offer
that
part
which
might
have
been
reasonable
that
you
limited
the
seizure
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
now
what
cases?
that's
the
argument
i'd
like
to
hear
because
it
seems
to
me
you've
reached
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
you
stated
that
certain
--
certain
items
were
taken
which
made
it
a
wholly
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
depending
this
as
being
a
reasonable
seizure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
safeguarding
a
toothpaste?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
afraid
they
couldn't
take
care
of
it?
do
you
think
your
officers
were
afraid?
is
the
government
arguing
that
this
is
a
reasonable
seizure?
if
so,
and
that's
the
basis
of
--
i
think
you
should
say
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
therefore,
we
do
not
agree
with
you
on
that
(inaudible)
but
if
we
do
not
agree
with
you
and
we
think
the
court
should
have
the
same,
as
i
do
in
it's
presence
that
the
seizure
was
--
could
not
be
defendant
is
reasonable.
the
question
i'd
like
to
hear
you'll
argue
is
was
there
cases
would
then
permit
you
to
offer
the
evidence,
those
articles
which
you
might
have
seized
reasonably
serious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
search
warrant
--
suppose
there
had
been
a
search
warrant,
but
to
get
down
the
--
i
think
your
argument
which
authorized
the
taking
of
everyone
of
these
items
that
you
took.
let's
supposed
that
although
you
doubt
i
think
(inaudible)
that
they
would
have
gotten
one
that
authorized
the
taking
of
all
of
them
and
the
court
held
that
the
search
warrant
was
bad
because
it
is
an
unreasonable
authorization
for
a
search.
could
you
then
have
offered
any
part
of
the
things
seized
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
our
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
any
cases
that
you
rely
on
to
that?
there
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
i
put
to
you
is
not
dead.
it
was
where
you
have
a
search
warrant
which
you
have
secured
from
an
officer
which
authorizes
a
seizure
of
all
these
things
in
the
house.
the
court
reaches
a
conclusion
that
the
search
warrant
is
bad
because
it
authorized
an
unreasonable
search.
could
you
then
offer
any
part
of
the
good
seized
in
evidence
under
our
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
couldn't
do
it
if
you
had
a
search
warrant
which
was
invalid
which
you
say
you
could
do
it
here
without
a
search
warrant.
