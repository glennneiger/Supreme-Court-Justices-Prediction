mr.
norman
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
had
affirmed
judgments
of
conviction
rendered
at
the
jury
trial
in
the
district
court
in
northern
district
of
california
against
the
three
petitioners
here.
the
petitioners
who
before
the
court
are
as
the
mr.
chief
justice
has
just
indicated,
shirley
kremen,
samuel
coleman
and
sidney
steinberg.
originally,
if
the
court
please,
there
were
five
defendants
in
this
case.
these
three
petitioners
and
two
others,
one
patricia
blau
who
was
acquitted
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case
by
the
district
judge
and
one
carl
ross
who
was
found
guilty,
but
who
being
unable
to
raise
the
bail
that
was
required
of
him
on
appeal
has
served
his
sentence
and
so
no
longer
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
in
that
connection,
i
might
say
that
some
of
these
other
petitioners
also
have
served
portions
of
this
sentence
because
of
the
difficulties
that
they
had
in
raising
bail,
but
subsequently,
they
did
raise
bail
and
they
are
now
out
but
there
are
still
substantial
portions
of
the
sentences
remaining
to
be
served.
so
that
no
sentence
in
this
case
is
moot.
but
petitioner
kremen
was
able
to
raise
her
bail
initially
so
she
still
has
her
full
sentence
ahead
of
her.
the
indictment
which
was
returned
is
in
four
counts
and
it
charged
in
the
first
count
that
when
robert
thompson
had
been
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
smith
act
in
new
york
in
1949,
parenthetically,
i
might
observed
that
thompson
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case
which
was
ultimately
affirmed
in
this
court.
and
that
first
count
continued
to
charge
that
all
five
of
those
named
defendants,
that
is
three
petitioners
here
and
the
two
others
who
i
mentioned,
were
accessories
after
the
fact
to
the
smith
act
conviction
in
1949
in
new
york.
it
was
alleged
that
they
were
accessories
after
the
fact
in
1953
in
california.
i
might
also
say
parenthetically
here
that
we
do
not
concede
that
count
one
properly
stated
the
offense
for
which
thompson
was
convicted.
i
will
come
to
that
point
later.
that's
one
of
the
points
on
certiorari.
here
i
simply
wish
to
summarize
the
indictment
with
the
court
as
a
prelude
to
the
argument.
the
second
count
of
the
indictment
alleged
that
all
five
of
those
defendants,
three
petitioners
here
and
the
two
others,
conspired
to
violate
the
accessory
after
the
fact
statute.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
offense
which
was
importantly
described
in
the
first
count
of
the
indictment.
the
third
count
of
the
indictment
charged
that
all
of
the
defendants
except
steinberg,
that
is
the
remaining
four
knowing
that
a
warrant
had
been
issued
for
steinberg's
arrest,
harbored
and
concealed
him
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
harboring
statute.
incidentally,
i
might
observe
that
the
warrant
for
steinberg's
arrest
was
in
the
proceeding
in
new
york
which
later
became
known
as
united
states
against
flynn
which
mr.
justice
harlan
sat
and
the
case
was
in
the
second
circuit.
the
certiorari
was
denied
here,
the
so-called
the
second
string
smith
act
cases
in
new
york.
there
was
a
warrant
up
for
steinberg.
he
was
found
to
use
later
in
california
and
was
alleged
that
these
people
had
harbored.
and
the
fourth
count,
the
last
count
of
the
indictment
alleged
that
all
four
of
these
defendants
conspired
to
harbor
steinberg.
so
it
was
a
conspiracy
charge
to
commit
the
subsequent
offense
set
forth
in
the
third
count
of
the
indictment
and
in
that
conspiracy
charge,
thompson
was
named
as
a
co-conspirator
but
not
as
a
defendant.
after
the
indictments
were
returned,
various
pretrial
motions
were
made
attacking
their
sufficiency,
seeking
particulars
and
other
forms
of
pretrial
discovery.
those
motions
were
all
denied.
i
think
more
important
for
the
argument
today
that
should
be
noted.
but
after
the
indictments
were
returned,
motions
seeking
the
suppression
of
evidence
allegedly
illegally
obtained
at
the
time
these
petitioners
were
arrested
were
also,
those
motions
were
supported
by
affidavit.
they
appear
on
the
record.
the
affidavits
appear
in
the
record.
pretrial
hearings
were
held
on
motion
to
suppress
and
testimony
was
taken.
those
motions
were
denied.
at
the
time
the
evidence
which
we
claimed
was
illegally
seized
was
tendered
on
the
trial,
motions
to
suppress
it
were
renewed
and
objections
to
the
evidence
were
made
on
the
ground
but
it
was
illegally
obtained
in
violation
of
the
guarantees
in
the
fourth
amendment.
the
motions
to
suppress
were
denied
and
the
objections
were
overruled.
while
initially
while
i'm
on
the
subject
of
evidence,
i
think
this
should
be
mentioned.
much
of
the
evidence
that
was
received
by
the
trial
court
was
offered
and
received
against
an
individual
defendant
--
the
specific
defendant
with
whom
there
was
some
apparent
connection
with
a
particular
item
of
evidence.
before
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
government
moved
that
all
of
the
evidence
be
received
against
all
of
the
defendants
and
that
motion
was
granted
and
it
was
that
posture
of
the
evidence
that
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case,
motions
of
the
judgment
of
acquittal
were
made
and
as
indicated
were
granted
only
as
to
the
defendant
blau
that
was
denied
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor
and
it
is
particularly
significant
on
the
question
of
the
search
and
seizure
because
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
it
seeks
to
segregate
some
of
this
evidence
and
says
that
these
petitioners
were
here
before
the
court
today
may
not
complain
if
evidence
that
was
illegally
obtained
from
somebody
else
was
received.
we
think
it's
significant
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
leonard
well
perhaps
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
appreciate
that
your
honor,
perhaps
it
will
become
clearer
or
i'll
try
to
make
them
clear
as
the
argument
develops.
after
the
jury
was
out
--
it
was
out
for
some
substantial
period
of
time,
nine
hours
and
reported
an
inability
to
agree
on
some
counts
at
least
and
a
verdict
then
have
to
some
further
instructions
and
return
a
guilty
verdict
against
all
of
the
defendants
on
all
of
the
counts.
the
motions
in
the
rest
of
judgment
for
new
trial
and
a
renewal
of
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
were
all
made
and
denied.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
--
well,
your
honor,
yes,
i
was
going
to
outline
the
background
of
the
case
and
then
come
to
the
questions
presented
by
the
writ.
but
let
me
--
let
me
do
that
now
and
then
go
back.
the
questions
which
we
presented
by
the
writ
and
the
writ
was
granted
without
any
limitation
are
substantially
these.
whether
the
search
of
the
premises
which
was
occupied
by
the
petitioners
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
the
seizure
of
the
books,
papers,
documents
and
other
evidence
that
was
so
seized
there
were
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
whether
or
not
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
so
seized
was
in
violation
of
the
fifth.
the
second
point
on
the
writ
was
whether
or
not
the
relevant
sections
of
the
criminal
statutes
involved
were
unconstitutionally
applied
to
these
petitioners.
there
are
certain
sub-points
in
that
regard.
and
the
third
question
presented
by
the
writ
is
whether
the
indictment,
at
least
the
first
count
of
it,
stated
an
offense
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
variance
between
it
and
the
proof
whether
the
trial
judge's
charge
is
correct
on
that
issue.
and
again,
that
is
a
matter
which
i
would
like
to
develop
when
i
get
to
that
point
of
the
argument.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
we
argued
that
primarily
as
an
incident
to
the
search
point.
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
--
after
the
verdict's
return,
sentences
of
varying
lengths
were
imposed
upon
the
petitioners
and
the
cases
of
two
of
them,
coleman
and
steinberg.
those
sentences
were
consecutive
so
that
the
court
is
faced
with
the
problem
of
examining
the
--
each
of
the
individual
counts
in
those
cases
because
we
don't
have
the
situation.
we
have
concurrent
sentences
and
it
can
be
sustained
on
one
count,
that's
the
end
of
it,
because
here
we
have
this
reversed
situation.
and
in
the
case
of
kremen,
although
the
sentences
were
concurrent,
the
sentence
on
the
first
and
second
count
of
the
indictment
was
a
one
year
sentence.
our
position
which
i
will
develop
a
little
bit
later
on
the
argument
is
that
at
most
there
was
an
act
of
harboring
here.
the
statute
on
the
harboring
count
permits
a
maximum
sentence
of
only
six
months
and
so
we
contend
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
sentences
were
concurrent,
there
was
no
warrant
for
the
one
year
sentence
under
the
accessory
count
because
all
we
have
here
we
say
is
an
act
of
harboring
which
is
a
misdemeanor
with
a
six-month
sentence.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
leonard
when
the
case
got
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
affirmed
the
judgments
below,
the
judges
writing
three
separate
opinions.
chief
judge
denman
dissented
and
judge
haley
wrote
a
brief
concurrence
to
the
rather
lengthy
opinion
of
judge
lemmon..
those
opinions
of
course
are
printed
in
the
record
and
they
also
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
are
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
as
it
is
required
by
the
rule.
i've
already
stated
to
the
court
what
the
questions
are
that
are
presented
by
the
petition
to
certiorari
and
which
are
before
the
court
today.
now
before
discussing
the
legal
principles
involved,
i
think
i
should
turn
briefly
to
the
facts
that
we
believe
are
relevant
to
the
search
and
seizure.
i
separate
my
discussion
of
the
facts
because
i
believe
the
law
to
be
that
the
court
may
only
consider
when
it
is
concerned
with
the
search
and
seizure
point
and
the
arrest
point
which
we
raised
in
a
manner
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
court
may
only
consider
the
evidence
that
the
officers
knew
at
that
time,
an
evidence
which
was
subsequently
developed,
of
course
is
not
relevant
on
the
question
of
validity
of
the
arrest
of
the
search
and
seizure.
so
the
evidence
which
was
known
as
far
it's
revealed
by
this
record,
at
the
time
that
the
arrest
and
the
search
and
seizure
took
place
was
this,
that
four
of
these
original
defendants,
three
petitioners
who
were
here
and
ross
were
arrested
shortly
after
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
august
27th,
1953
at
a
cabin
or
a
house
in
twain
harte,
california.
twain
harte
is
a
small
summer
resort
town
near
sonora,
california
and
the
mother
lode
country
in
the
foothills
of
the
sierras.
at
the
time
that
those
four
were
arrested,
there
was
also
present
on
the
premises,
robert
thompson,
a
defendant
from
the
dennis
case.
patricia
blau,
the
other
defendant
was
arrested
later
in
the
day
at
a
different
place
apparently
arrested
from
some
leads
that
the
government
agents
obtained
when
they
went
through
the
--
premises
of
twain
harte.
the
fact
that
she
was
arrested
later
i
think
is
enough
for
us
to
--
to
pass
over
her
arrest
because
certainly
nothing
that
the
officers
learned
when
they
arrested
her
five
or
six
or
seven
hours
later
but
retrospectively
so
to
speak,
justify
the
arrest
at
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
so
we
have
to
go
back
to
that
situation
i
think.
now,
this
record
reveals
and
i
think
it's
undisputed
that
for
some
period
of
time
prior
to
these
actual
arrests,
these
agents
had
the
petitioners
under
some
substantial
surveillance
and
that
they're
very
carefully
prepared
these
arrests.
the
record
shows
that
agents
who
had
their
headquarters
in
new
york
city
had
arrived
in
san
francisco
at
least
two
days
before
the
arrests
to
participate
in
it.
and
other
agents
from
the
san
francisco
area
had
gone
up
to
twain
harte
at
least
two
days
before
the
arrest
or
participate
in
the
arrests.
now
one
of
them
had
actually
gone
to
the
premises
the
day
before
with
an
employee
of
pacific
gas
and
electric
company.
the
agents
sat
on
the
truck
while
the
employee
went
on
the
premises
on
a
pretext
in
inspecting
a
light
meter
or
gas
meter
or
something
in
the
agents
premises.
also,
when
they
came
out
the
next
day
they
brought
with
them
a
(inaudible)
apparently
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
female
on
the
premises
and
they
were
going
to
arrest
her.
now,
how
much
longer
than
the
two
or
three
days
that
the
record
reveals,
the
agents
were
actually
engaged
in
preparing
for
this
arrest,
or
how
much
longer
they
had
these
petitioners
under
surveillance
is
not
revealed
by
the
record
for
the
reasons
that
although
we
sought
this
information
both
on
the
motions
to
suppress
on
the
trial
itself,
the
trial
judge
precluded
us
by
his
rulings
to
sustain
government
objections
by
finding
it
out.
and
he
wouldn't
let
us
go
beyond
the
point
when
the
agents
left
their
headquarters
to
proceed.
how
much
else
there
was?
we
do
not
know.
but
we
do
know
this
that
the
arrests
were
carefully
prepared.
a
continued
surveillance
was
maintained
for
at
least
eight
hours
prior
to
the
time
of
the
actual
arrest.
agents
were
stationed
around
the
cabin.
they
maintained
an
elaborate
communication
system
with
their
headquarters
and
walkie-talkie
setup
so
they
could
report
to
their
headquarters
what
was
going
on.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
all
the
reports
they
made
indicated
nothing
but
normal
activities
that
one
would
expect
in
a
--
in
a
summer
resort
area.
thompson
was
seen
to
come
out
practicing
fly
cast.
other
people
were
walking
round
the
premises.
somebody
was
sitting
down
at
the
table
outside
the
building
and
probably
drawing
or
writing
and
mrs.
kremen
came
out
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
apparently
and
hang
up
some
laundry.
by
noon
of
that
day
according
to
the
agents,
they
satisfied
themselves
with
two
of
the
people
that
they
have
under
observation
were
thompson
and
steinberg.
they
said
they
have
some
difficulty
at
first
because
there
were
--
there
was
substantial
change
in
appearances.
thompson
didn't
look
like
he
had
look
when
he
was
in
new
york
a
couple
of
years
earlier
when
they
had
known
him.
steinberg
had
to
put
on
some
weight,
but
they
satisfied
themselves
that
these
were
the
men
that
they
were
looking
for.
they
relayed
this
information
to
their
superiors
and
were
told
to
standby
to
assist
a
raiding
party
and
that
was
their
own
characterization
of
what
it
was,
a
raiding
party
that
would
come
up
in
effect
the
arrest.
and
about
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
something
like
15
agents
with
the
matrons
swoop
down
on
the
cabin.
and
at
that
moment,
thompson
and
steinberg
were
outside
the
cabin
about
40
or
50
feet
away
from
them.
they
were
immediately
taken
into
custody
and
they
were
advised
that
they
were
being
arrested
for
the
smith
act
violations
on
the
outstanding
process.
there
was
no
show
of
resistance
by
them.
no
attempt
to
flee.
no
weapons
of
any
kind
were
found.
no
weapons
of
any
kind
were
found
in
any
place
on
anybody.
the
others,
ross,
coleman
and
kremen
were
inside
the
cabin.
the
agents
were
sent
to
the
cabin
and
ordered
them
out.
at
this
point,
i
should
like
to
say
this
that
in
the
briefs,
both
sides,
the
government
and
us
have
assumed
that
the
arrests
of
those
three,
ross,
kremen
and
coleman
took
place
inside
the
cabin.
however,
a
more
careful
reading
of
the
record
i
think
convinces
me
that
i
was
in
error
in
making
that
assumption
in
the
brief.
and
i
think
the
record
doesn't
justify
an
assumption
that
those
three
were
arrested
inside
the
cabin.
i
don't
want
to
labor
this
point
because
our
case
doesn't
turn
on
it
of
course,
but
i
do
think
that
the
court
should
know
and
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
specifically
to
page
101
of
the
record.
it
appears
in
the
first
volume
where
--
when
the
agent
in
charge
of
the
operation
was
being
interrogated
on
the
pretrial
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
his
attention
was
specifically
directed
to
what
happened
with
the
three
people
inside
the
cabin.
he
says
--
i
don't
think
i
need
to
read
it
to
the
court
at
page
101
of
volume
1
--
volume
1
of
the
record
at
page
101.
the
court
will
see
he
says
that
they
were
taken
outside
and
advised
that
they
were
being
under
arrest
and
specifically
the
question
is
asked
in
the
middle
of
page,
"when
was
that?
while
still
in
the
--
in
the
house
or
after
you
had
taken
them
outside?"
answer
"while
they
were
all
outside."
and
then
counsel
restates
it,
"is
this
correct,
that
you
found
the
other
three
defendants
in
that
house?"
"yes
sir."
"you
gave
orders
because
they're
taken
outside?"
and
outside
they
were
told
that
they
were
under
arrest
for
the
reasons
you
indicated?"
and
were
they
handcuffed?
they
were
all
then
handled.
so,
i
think
this
is
circumstance
as
i
say
our
case
certainly
doesn't
turn
by
any
manner
it
means.
but
i
think
it's
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
the
subsequent
search
that
the
arrests
of
these
people,
two
apparently
even
occurred
outside
of
the
cabin.
but
in
any
--
mr.
norman
leonard
there
were
two
sets
of
these
pretrial
proceedings
were.
the
ones
that
i
just
made
reference
to.
there
was
one
proceeding
on
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
in
support
of
the
motion
to
suppress,
that
was
before
judge
murphy
--
district
judge
murphy.
subsequently,
when
the
actual
hearing
on
evidence
--
the
introducing
of
evidence
took
place
that
was
before
judge
goodman
and
he
was
the
judge
who
often
tried
the
case.
mr.
norman
leonard
august
27th,
1953.
mr.
norman
leonard
i'll
have
to
examine
--
it
was
in
april
--
mr.
norman
leonard
april
of
1954.
i
don't
--
mr.
norman
leonard
two
weeks.
mr.
norman
leonard
well,
late
april
or
early
may.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
don't
recall
when
the
record
was
docketed,
your
honor,
the
decision
of
the
--
then
it
was
argued
and
briefed
of
course
and
then
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
appears
in
january
of
1956.
it
was
argued
--
mr.
norman
leonard
that's
right
sir.
it
was
a
pretty
extensive
record
and
the
problems
of
getting
it
printed
and
getting
it
--
mr.
norman
leonard
i
mean
that's
--
that's
--
that
was
it.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
although
it
may
not
directly
relevant
during
some
of
this
time,
some
of
these
people
were
in
jail
unable
to
raise
bail
but
ultimately
except
for
ross
they
all
did
raise
it
and
are
now
out
and
have
substantial
portions
of
their
time
yet
to
serve.
in
any
case,
now
we
have
all
the
people
outside
the
cabin
and
in
custody
and
then
the
search
of
which
we
make
our
principal
complaint
took
place.
now,
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
describe
the
search
of
the
court
is
not
my
own
words
but
without
reading
at
any
great
length
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
transcript
again
at
same
volume
at
page
209.
beginning
at
page
209
and
running
on
for
about
four
pages
to
page
213
where
the
agent
who
made
the
search
is
testifying
and
this
too
was
on
the
--
no.
excuse
me.
this
was
not
on
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress.
now,
this
--
this
--
this
is
--
is
on
the
trial
itself.
mr.
ericson
testifies,
"then
i
went
into
the
house."
and
this
is
very
significant.
in
order
to
see
what
there
was
relating
to
this
matter.
that
was
his
purpose.
he
didn't
go
into
house
for
some
specific
narrow
purpose
but
in
order
to
see
what
there
was
relating
to
this
matter.
maybe
he's
going
to
look
for
anything
he
could
find
relating
to
this
matter
and
that's
precisely
what
he
did
as
the
remaining
pages
will
show.
he
says,
on
page
210
that
he
entered
through
the
kitchen
and
he
describes
what
he
found
there,
then
he
went
into
the
dining
room
or
the
dinette
and
tells
what
he
saw
there.
on
the
table
were
two
boxes
and
in
the
next
paragraph
he
says,
"the
large
box
contained
the
mimeograph
machine."
and
then
the
other
box
was
stencil
copies
and
paper,
ink
and
silk.
then
after
leaving
the
kitchen,
the
dining
room,
he
proceeds
into
the
living
room.
he
notices
what
furniture
he
saw
there
and
he
notices
that
there
was
a
desk.
under
the
desk,
at
the
top
of
page
211,
it
was
a
typewriter.
and
in
the
desk
at
the
top
of
page
211,
there
were
also
many
papers.
from
there
he
goes
on
upstairs
and
he
climbed
the
stairway
at
the
head
of
the
closet
--
at
the
head
of
the
stairway.
he
opens
the
closet.
he
finds
a
box
in
it.
it
contained
numerable
types
of
papers
of
various
types,
i
come
through
the
papers.
then
he
goes
into
other
bedroom.
and
the
same
thing
is
repeated.
in
the
bedroom,
he
finds
a
suitcase
which
he
obviously
must
have
opened
with
several
documents
in
it
and
papers.
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
were
three
cardboard
boxes,
all
containing
papers
which
i
looked
through.
on
the
bed
was
a
briefcase,
it
was
quite
filled
with
papers
and
documents.
also,
there
was
a
suitcase
and
it
too
contained
documents.
there
was
in
--
on
the
dresser,
he
found
a
cardboard
box
containing
documents,
a
briefcase
containing
papers
and
just
on
top
of
it
was
a
pair
of
keys.
and
that
pair
of
keys
is
also
significant
in
this
case.
then,
he
goes
to
the
other
bedroom
which
apparently
was
the
ladies
bedroom.
it
contains
ladies
clothing
and
there
he
finds
nothing
but
a
typewriter.
he
then
goes
back
downstairs.
he
finds
some
sleeping
bags
out
on
the
porch
and
there
are
two
automobiles
outside
and
he
looks
through
the
glove
compartment
of
the
automobiles
and
finds
registration
and
identification
papers
and
the
court
will
note
that
at
that
point
when
he
gave
this
testimony
of
this
long
rambling
search,
i
move
to
strike
that
testimony
on
the
ground
that
there
wasn't
any
showing
of
any
process
that
ever
been
issued
before
it
and
the
motion
was
denied.
then
he
testifies
on
page
213
that
he
reported
to
his
superior
what
he
had
seen
and
it's
interestingly
the
emphasis
is
there
on
page
213
principally
mentioned
the
documents
in
these
various
boxes
and
suitcases.
that's
what
they're
interested.
and
he
was
instructed
by
the
agent
as
he
testifies
to
prepare
to
take
the
material
all
back
to
san
francisco.
he
did,
they
loaded
all
this
material
in
automobiles
and
took
it
back
to
san
francisco.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
would
say
--
mr.
norman
leonard
--
i
would
say
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well,
i
would
cite
my
reading
of
the
whole
page,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
he
had
taken
physical
possessions
and
essentially
put
them
on
the
automobile
because
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
was
principally
interested
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
leonard
he
asked
for
instructions
and
his
superior
said,
"well,
go
ahead
and
take
them
and
bring
them
back
to
san
francisco,"
which
he
did.
mr.
norman
leonard
one
might
make
that
inference
--
mr.
norman
leonard
one
might
make
it.
i
--
mr.
norman
leonard
--
respectfully
submit
that
it's
not
material
because
whether
he
had
--
mr.
norman
leonard
--
taken
it
at
that
point
or
took
it
a
minute
later
pursuant
to
the
instruction
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well,
you
have
a
point
there
sir
that
i
overlooked.
mr.
norman
leonard
perhaps
--
perhaps
what
he
--
he
should
have
done
was
he
so
advised
his
--
his
superiors
to
what
he
had
seen.
the
people
were
in
custody.
there
were
plenty
of
agents
there
to
--
to
have
--
one
of
them
stand
guard
and
--
and
he
might
very
well
at
that
point
have
said,
"let's
get
down
and
get
the
warrant
now,
because
now
we
see
what
there
is.
they
could
have
described
it
and
so
on."
but
that
was
not
--
that
was
not
done
of
course
and
what
was
done
is
what
the
record
reveals
that
he
was
instructed
to
return
all
--
to
take
this
material
to
san
francisco
without
process
--
without
process.
and
he
--
he
did
so.
mr.
norman
leonard
this
was
shortly
after
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
and
the
arrests
i
believe
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
agent
testified
that
the
arrest
action
took
place
at
1:04
to
make
it
precise.
now
we
have
set
forth
in
--
in
our
brief
a
list
of
the
places
where
united
states
commissioners
maintained
their
offices
in
and
around
that
vicinity.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
the
nearest
(voice
overlap)
--
the
nearest
one
is
either
stocked
in
the
modesto,
california
50
or
60
miles
away.
of
course
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes
sir.
the
--
the
commissioner
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
well,
the
commissioner
stockton
was
the
one
before
whom
the
defendant
blau
who
is
not
in
the
case
was
arraigned
when
she
was
taken
in.
during
a
pre
--
first
the
pretrial
proceedings
we
did
get
one
bit
of
relief.
judge
murphy
directed
the
government
that
furnishes
with
an
inventory
of
what
had
been
seized.
that
inventory
took
--
it
took
25
single
space
typewritten
pages
for
the
government
to
prepare
such
an
inventory
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
appended
that
inventory
as
an
appendix
to
our
opening
brief.
the
court
will
examine
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief,
you
will
see
some
24
pages,
one
page
less
than
printing
than
in
typing,
of
the
most
detailed
kind
of
material
that
was
seized
during
this
raid.
we
think
--
mr.
norman
leonard
by
the
fbi,
by
the
agents
subsequent
to
the
arrests.
mr.
norman
leonard
no,
we
don't
know
when
but
we
do
know
that
unless
it
appears
at
data,
i
don't
think
it
does,
no.
but
during
the
pretrial
proceedings
judge
murphy
ordered
that
a
copy
be
furnish
to
us
and
it
was
and
that's
how
you
obtained
it.
you
had
a
question.
mr.
norman
leonard
well,
i
--
i
will
come
to
that.
of
course
much
of
it
wasn't
used
beginning
at
page
18
of
our
--
of
the
inventory
that
is
in
the
appendix.
you
will
note
--
the
court
will
note
that
beginning
of
the
reference
in
these
pages
from
--
papers
from
the
chevrolet,
package
of
papers
and
so
on.
that
were
list
of
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
they
took
it
to
san
francisco.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
and
except
for
some
personal
items
and
except
for
the
automobiles
they
had
not
yet
been
returned.
mr.
norman
leonard
oh,
yeah.
well,
i
--
i
--
neglected
one
thing
your
honor
that
again
he
testified
later
and
i
don't
think
i
need
to
further
it
all
with
the
record
references
that
he
talked
to
the
realtor.
this
cabin
was
rented
as
a
furnished
cabin
and
he
got
the
realtor
apparently
later
that
day,
as
near
as
we
can
ascertain
in
the
record."
i
went
through
the
premises
with
the
realtor
and
took
everything."
that
was
his
language.
"everything
saved
that
which
the
realtor
identified
as
belonging
to
the
cabin,
as
going
with
the
furniture."
that
accounts
for
the
books
to
close,
the
briefcases,
the
items
of
furniture
et
cetera
which
the
realtor
said,
"well,
that
doesn't
belong
to
me."
that's
what
these
people
brought
in.
so,
he
went
through
the
cabin
in
the
absence
of
the
--
mr.
norman
leonard
oh,
no.
and
--
and
the
record
is
clear
that
the
--
these
premises
were
at
least
by
mrs.
kremen
and
that
the
rent
had
been
paid
up.
they
were
in
lawful
possessions.
no
questions
about
--
about
that.
mr.
norman
leonard
your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
come
to
that.
not
all
of
these
evidence
was
introduced
of
course.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
might
say
that
a
good
deal
more
was
offered
than
was
introduced,
the
trial
judge
excluded
a
lot
of
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
prohibitive
or
in
his
view
wasn't
prohibitive
or
wasn't
relevant
or
it
wasn't
properly
connected
up
with
one
or
more
than
the
defendants.
that
evidence
which
he
thought
was
relevant,
was
prohibitive,
and
was
connected
up
with
the
defendants,
precisely
the
evidence
that
would
damage
them.
he
permitted
to
go
in
--
mr.
norman
leonard
exactly.
mr.
norman
leonard
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
now
what
was
introduced
was
--
was
this.
directly
used
against
these
petitioners
were
papers
indicating
that
they
were
operating
under
false
identity,
social
security
cards,
driver's
licenses,
fishing
licenses
and
things
of
that
kind
shows
that
they
established
the
false
identity.
the
two
keys
that
i
mentioned
were
introduced
in
evidence
and
it's
perfectly
apparent
from
this
record
that
those
keys
--
automobile
keys
were
later
used
because
they
called
the
locksmith
to
testify
to
trace
back
to
an
automobile
from
which
it
was
established
that
the
petitioner
coleman
had
driven
thompson
various
points
around
the
country.
the
--
that
evidence
was
obviously
the
fruit
of
those
keys.
two
notebooks
--
three
notebooks,
exhibits
26,
27,
and
28
in
this
record
were
introduced
showing
various
kinds
of
meetings,
contacts
between
people,
all
of
which
would
indicate
some
kind
of
conspiracy
as
the
government
put
it
in
the
--
in
the
underground.
that
evidence
was
introduced
against
them.
the
government
argues
that
some
of
this
testimony
was
taken
from
the
persons
and
therefore
a
different
rule
should
apply.
in
that
regard,
i
think
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
with
respect
and
to
the
persons
now
before
the
court,
that
situation
will
not
cure
what
happened
here.
as
far
as
coleman
is
concerned
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
he
was
wearing
nothing
but
a
pair
of
swimming
trunks
at
the
time
and
nothing
was
taken
from
this
person.
as
far
as
steinberg
was
concerned,
some
documents
were
taken
from
a
wallet
and
it's
very
interesting
the
way
that
the
government
says
they
were
taken
from
his
purse.
this
wallet
was
in
the
house.
after
the
arrest,
the
agent
said
to
the
people,
"we're
going
to
have
to
take
you
down
to
san
francisco
to
arraign
you.
will
you
go
in
and
get
whatever
clothes
you
want,
because
they
were
wearing
summer
clothes
in
this
resort
community."
and
steinberg
picked
up
a
pair
of
trousers
and
had
a
wallet
there.
and
the
agent
said,
"is
that
your
wallet?"
he
said,
"yes."
and
then
the
agent
grabbed
and
took
it.
now,
i
don't
concede
that
that's
taken
from
the
person
of
--
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
he's
arrested
the
same
thing
with
the
respect
--
mr.
norman
leonard
excuse
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
the
documents
establishing
his
false
identity
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
purse
from
which
documents
involving
the
petitioner
kremen
were
taken.
she
was
told
to
go
in
and
get
what
she
needed
for
the
trip
to
san
francisco,
primarily
she
picked
up
the
purse
and
the
agent
took
it
from
her.
mr.
norman
leonard
to
take
that
wallet
possible,
possibly,
i
think
it
would
be
questionable.
our
position
overall
here
is
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
think
it's
a
close
question
whether
a
search
warrant
could
--
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
there
could
have
been
an
appropriate
search
warrant
not
for
this
search.
i
think
a
search
warrant
in
the
terms
of
the
amendment
specifically
describing
the
articles
to
be
seized
could
have
issued.
i
think
they
could
have
gone
down
as
was
suggested
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
the
commissioner
and
said
we've
gone
through
these
premises
and
we
find
--
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
we
find
thus
and
so
and
we
think
that
these
cards,
these
items,
these
things
are
--
we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
maybe
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well
--
mr.
norman
leonard
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
norman
leonard
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
we
have
too
look
at
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
i
understand.
i
think
we've
got
to
look
at
this
whole
picture
and
i
think
the
government
cannot
justify
what
was
done.
i
don't
think
a
search
warrant
would
justify
it
because
the
amendment
is
clear
that
people
are
to
be
protected
in
their
homes
and
properties
and
no
search
shall
issue
except
on
a
search
warrant
specifically
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
property
to
be
seized.
mr.
norman
leonard
specifically
describing.
mr.
norman
leonard
exactly.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
that
it
could
not
have
been
done
here.
now,
to
get
to
the
--
the
government
of
course
can
seize
that
there
wasn't
any
warrant
here
but
it
suggest
that
this
search
and
seizure
could
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
was
incidental
to
valid
arrest.
we
answer
that
that
isn't
so
because
first,
the
arrest
themselves
were
invalid.
certainly,
the
arrests
of
kremen,
coleman
and
ross
without
process
and
here
is
the
situation,
no
process
for
the
search,
no
process
for
that
arrest.
those
arrest
weren't
valid
we
say
and
they
can't
be
justified
on
the
so-called
exception
that
an
offense
was
being
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officers,
the
offense
being
either
harboring
or
accessoryship,
we
maintain
and
time
just
won't
permit
me
to
develop
the
arguments
as
developed
in
the
briefs.
that
there
must
be
more
than
mere
presence
with
the
fugitive
even
presence
overnight
which
is
the
most
that
they
had.
to
give
an
office
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
is
harboring
the
fugitive
arrest
and
otherwise
every
hotel
keeper,
every
person
who
was
with
the
fugitive
would
be
subject
to
arrest
on
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
leonard
oh
yes,
i'm
not
talking
now
about
the
arrest
of
the
fugitives.
i'm
talking
about
the
arrest
of
the
person
--
there
was
process
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
leonard
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
mr.
norman
leonard
oh
about
the
about
the
people
for
whom
they
had
--
had
process,
we
say
--
mr.
norman
leonard
oh
the
--
the
person
with
whom
he
is.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
that
living
with
him
overnight
isn't
enough.
i
think
that
there
are
particularly
in
a
resort
community,
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
leonard
the
officers
didn't
know
whether
it
was
or
not
at
the
time.
it
was
--
it
was
a
cabin
in
the
country
and
there
were
five
people
in
a
resort
area.
it
didn't
say
hotel
or
inn
on
it
to
be
sure,
but
it
might
very
well
have
been
a
guest
house.
i
think
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
arrest
because
i
think
even
if
the
arrest
were
valid,
the
search
as
it
has
been
here
described
was
invalid
and
on
that
of
course
we
rely
on
many
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
limit
the
purpose
and
scope
of
searches
to
the
objectives
of
the
amendment
and
particularly,
we
like
to
recall
to
this
court
the
language
of
mr.
--
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
kirshenblatt
case,
whether
there
was
a
valid
arrest.
but
nonetheless,
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
valid
arrest,
there
was
a
wholesale
rummaging
through
the
household
and
judge
hand
in
kirshenblatt
striking
it
down
said,
"after
arresting
a
man
in
his
house,
and
that
was
a
valid
arrest,
to
rummage
at
will
among
his
papers
and
search
of
whatever
will
convict
him
appears
to
us
to
be
indistinguishable
from
what
might
have
been
done
under
a
general
warrant."
indeed,
said
judge
hand,
the
warrant
would
give
more
protection
for
presumably
it
must
be
issued
by
the
magistrate.
and
if
it
could
have
been
issued
by
a
magistrate,
we
think
perhaps
it
couldn't
have,
there
would
have
been
some
protection.
and
judge
hand
concluded,
"no
less
must
we
forget
that
what
seems
fair
enough
against
a
squad
of
huckster
of
bad
liquor
may
take
on
a
very
different
phase
if
used
by
a
government
determined
to
suppress
political
opposition
--
mr.
norman
leonard
--
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well
i
understand.
i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
the
cases
upon
which
the
government
relies.
the
rabinowitz
case
and
the
harris
case
have
changed
that
law
of
judge
carson
--
of
judge
hand
because
in
all
of
those
cases
as
we
try
to
point
out
in
our
briefs,
we
had
--
first
you
had
valid
warrants
then
you
have
specific,
narrow
searches
for
specific
contraband
objects.
i
think
that
the
principles
of
(inaudible),
lefkowitz
are
still
good
law,
this
court
has
never
said
they
weren't.
mr.
norman
leonard
after
which
there
was
a
single
room,
it
was
--
of
course
they
were
there
under
a
warrant
too.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
have
to
defend
those.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
so.
mr.
norman
leonard
that
the
arrest
is
valid.
mr.
norman
leonard
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes.
i
--
i
--
that
--
that's
true.
i
--
i
was
doing
that.
i
don't
want
to
over
look
the
fact
that
we
have
a
point
here
that
this
arrest
were
not
valid
and
with
respect
to
thompson
and
steinberg,
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
arrest
outside
the
house
even
if
it
was
valid
does
not
justify
the
search
inside
the
house
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
an
arrest
outside
the
house
will
justify
a
search
inside.
mr.
norman
leonard
well,
i
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
what
the
permissible
limits
of
the
search
would
be
mr.
justice
harlan.
my
--
frankly,
my
problem
here
is
to
convince
the
court
if
i
can
that
this
search
went
beyond
those
permissible
limits
whatever
they
were.
mr.
norman
leonard
well
it's
--
i
appreciate
it's
a
difficult
question
to
draw
the
line.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
in
these
cases,
what
it
has
to
do
is
decide
the
case
from
the
whole
atmosphere,
the
total
facts
of
the
case.
and
it
is
our
view
that
on
the
total
facts
of
this
case
at
least
this
search
was
not
permissible
whether
the
agents
could
have
in
some
fashion
gone
to
the
commissioner
in
stockton,
told
them
what
had
transpired
up
to
that
point
and
prepared
appropriate
affidavits
so
that
under
the
guidance
of
a
magistrate
would
be
in
a
position
of
the
judicial
objectivity
that
is
suppose
to
take
place
and
which
obviously
didn't
take
place.
and
whether
they
could
have
succeeded
in
preparing
the
right
kind
of
a
record
that
would
stand
up
is
a
question.
i'm
inclined
to
doubt
because
i
think
what
they
were
seeking
is
perfectly
manifest
was
evidence.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
so.
i
think
it
certainly
goes
to
the
question
--
it's
relevant
to
the
question
of
its
purpose.
it
highlights
the
object
and
purpose
of
it
and
the
fact
that
they
used
it
to
give
them
leads
to
other
have
evidence.
it
judge
denman
in
the
court
below
as
you
have
observed
from
his
dissenting
opinion
thought
that
that
was
a
factor
of
significance.
and
thought
that
this
court's
opinion
in
lefkowitz,
would
have
outlawed
a
search
and
the
transportation
particularly,
he
emphasized
the
transportation
to
san
francisco.
mr.
norman
leonard
excuse
me?
mr.
norman
leonard
i
would
say
that
if
they
had
gone
far
beyond,
that
would
invalidate
the
entire
situation.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
standards
of
conducts
of
federal
officers.
there
are
number
of
objections
i
might
say
incidentally,
that
the
government
is
opposed
to
this
thing.
time
just
won't
permit
me
to
discuss,
they're
in
the
brief.
the
government
says
that
our
people
don't
have
standards
to
raise
it
because
we
didn't
have
possession
or
we
didn't
claim
property
rights.
they
--
they
made
technical
objections
of
that
find
too.
i
don't
think
we're
concerned
with
questions
of
that
kind
nor
do
i
think
we're
concern
with
the
technical
rules
of
evidence
as
to
whether
this
particular
piece
of
evidence
perhaps
they
could
have
taken
and
that
one
they
couldn't.
the
fourth
amendment
enjoins
the
federal
government
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
indicated
from
entering
people's
homes
and
seizing
their
property
without
warrant.
and
once
it's
shown
that
they've
done
that
which
is
what
is
clearly
shown
on
this
record
and
then
engaging
in
the
kind
of
rummaging
search
that
they
did.
i
think
that
their
conduct
must
be
stricken
down.
i
think
that
as
a
supervisory
court,
this
court
has
done
it
before
precisely
because
we're
dealing
with
federal
officers.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
state
case
here.
we're
dealing
with
officers
in
effect
this
court
and
the
federal
government.
now
we
can't
--
this
court
cannot
permit
that
kind
of
conduct
to
go
on
with
so
to
speak
by
an
argument.
well,
this
little
piece
was
all
right.
this
little
piece
could
have
been
taken
or
that
little
piece
could
have
been
taken.
and
the
total
situation
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
officers
acted
--
mr.
norman
leonard
well
i
think
the
government
avoided
if
i
may
say
so,
of
course
we'll
hear
from
counsel
in
a
few
moments.
i
think
the
government
avoids
meeting
the
issue.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
illustrates
the
illegality
of
what
the
government
did.
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
would
--
you
might
have
a
question
of
balancing
some
convenience
here.
if
there
was
one
piece
of
evidence
that
was
immaterial
and
all
the
rest
of
it
was
properly
admissible,
that
might
be
one
situation.
here,
you
have
almost
the
reverse
situation
where
there
were
a
handful
of
pieces
that
the
trial
judge
admitted
very
damaging
but
just
a
handful
and
then
the
hundreds
of
others.
mr.
norman
leonard
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
but
i
think
the
fact
that
they
seized,
just
swooped
up
everything
cannot
be
ignored
even
though
it
wasn't
received
an
evidence,
cannot
be
ignored
in
assessing
the
conduct
of
the
officers
who
are
federal
officers
who
are
bound
by
the
fourth
amendment
just
the
way
everybody
else
and
the
country
is
bound
by
the
fourth
amendment.
there
are
a
number
of
subordinate
points
here
that
i
just
--
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
rely
on
what
we
said
in
our
briefs
in
connection
with
them.
there
are
two
other
points
in
connection
with
this
writ
that
i
think
the
court
need
not
reach
because
i
believe
that
the
search
point
that
we
have
been
discussing
at
such
great
length
in
this
argument
is
dispositive
of
the
case.
but
should
the
court
disagree
with
me,
i
would
like
to
just
mention
them
briefly.
we
do
contend
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutionally
apply
to
these
people
because
the
facts,
what
were
shown
was
a
single
act
of
harboring
and
nonetheless,
by
charging
four
separate
and
distinct
offenses,
the
penalties
which
were
imposed
upon
these
people
greatly
exceeded
what
could
have
been
imposed
under
the
harboring
statute.
now
the
government
makes
an
argument
in
its
brief
that
well,
the
elements
of
the
crime
are
different.
they
are
separate
elements
of
the
crime
and
they
setup
the
elements
in
great
detail.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
we
never
argued
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
the
--
the
accessoryship
statute
or
the
harboring
statute
but
we
said,
that
what
the
government
proved
and
all
that
it
proved
here
was
one
offense
but
the
identical
evidence
that
was
used
to
establish
the
harboring
is
also
used
to
establish
the
accessoryship.
and
if
there
are
differences,
different
elements
in
these
crimes,
the
government
didn't
established
any
different
elements,
it
simply
established
--
mr.
norman
leonard
no,
i
don't
think.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
take
it
that
for
judge
denman
meant
that
--
was
that
if
they
hadn't
proved
the
substantive
offense
they
couldn't
have
proved
the
conspiracy.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
take
it
that
what
he
had
in
mind
is
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
conspiracy
requires
proof
of
--
no
it
couldn't
have
been.
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
conspiracy
requires
proof
of
both
the
substantive
offense
and
an
agreement
and
therefore
if
he
didn't
prove
the
substantive
offense
--
but
that
isn't
so.
i
think
what
he
must
have
had
in
mind
is
this,
that
the
failure
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
substantive
offense
of
harboring,
indicates
also
that
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
with
respect
to
conspiracy
for
this
reason.
because
he
said
that
the
reason
he
gave
for
believing
that
there
was
no
proof
of
harboring
was
that
there
was
no
proof
that
these
people
had
the
requisite
knowledge
that
they
knew
that
the
person
was
a
fugitive
or
that
they
knew
that
there
was
process
for
him.
therefore,
the
substantive
count
had
to
fall.
well,
if
there
was
no
proof
that
they
knew
that
there
was
process
for
him
or
knew
that
he
was
a
fugitive,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
proof
of
conspiracy
to
do
that
either.
i
think
that
was
the
basis
of
judge
denman's
reason.
we
make
additional
arguments
with
respect
to
this
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
that
i
will
again
have
to
refer
the
court
to
the
briefs
for
them.
but
to
say
this,
the
government
contends
that
there
-
it
approved
here
two
separate
conspiracies,
one
conspiracy
to
harbor
steinberg,
one
conspiracy
to
be
accessories
after
the
fact
of
thompson's
arrest.
they
said
there
are
two
separate
conspiracies.
again,
we
argued
that
the
proof
was
identical,
the
overt
acts
were
identical
but
quite
apart
from
that.
if
the
government's
theory
is
set,
they
could
have
charged
these
people
with
three
conspiracies,
the
steinberg
conspiracy
and
thompson
conspiracy
and
a
joint
conspiracy
which
they
say
occurred
later.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
and
the
briefs
reveal
and
i
think
the
government
will
dispute
it
that
about
this
time
although
it
isn't
true
today.
at
about
this
time,
there
was
some
five
or
six
of
these
fugitives.
our
contention
is
that
certainly,
it
couldn'tbeen
said
that
if
all
five
or
six
of
those
fugitives
were
found
there
that
there
were
five
or
six
separate
conspiracy.
there
was
one
conspiracy
as
a
matter
--
if
there
was
any
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
prosecutor
so
stated
in
his
opening
argument
to
the
jury,
called
this
a
communist
party
conspiracy
to
protect
its
leadership.
the
mere
fact
that
they
protected
two
leaders
or
three
leaders
or
four
leaders
wouldn't
make
it
two
or
three
or
four
conspiracies.
i
don't
think
the
offenses
could
be
so
multiply.
now,
finally,
we
contend
on
our
third
point,
i
haven't
touched
all
the
sub-points
or
the
second
point,
the
time
won't
permit
it
but
we
contend
that
the
indictment
was
defective
for
this
reason,
that
it
alleged
that
thompson
was
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
to
organize
a
society
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
in
violation
of
sections
2,
3
and
5
of
the
smith
act,
2,
3
and
5
of
the
smith
act
of
course
do
not
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
conspiracy.
they
deal
with
conspiracies
to
teach
inevitably.
we
said
the
indictment
was
inconsistent
on
its
face.
on
the
one
hand,
it
says,
he
was
guilty
of
the
offense
of
conspiring
to
overthrow
in
violation
of
a
statute
which
doesn't
talk
about
all
the
time.
the
proof
was
a
variance
with
the
indictment
if
you
eliminate
the
conclusion
about
the
smith
act
from
the
indictment
because
the
proof
was
that
the
conspiracy
was
to
teach
and
advocate
rather
than
to
organize
or
overthrow
and
the
trial
judge
erroneously
instructed
the
jury
that
the
proof
conformed
to
the
indictment.
but
we
think
that
the
court
need
not
really
reach
those
points.
we
think
that
this
case
is
a
square
of
search
and
seizure
case.
i
don't
mean
i'm
abandoning
those
points,
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood.
but
we
do
think
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
these
people
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
violated.
and
we
think
that
that's
the
issue
on
which
it
ought
to
be
and
should
be
decided
in
their
favor.
the
government
makes
some
arguments
about
--
about
lack
of
possession,
lack
of
claim
of
property
on
the
part
of
these
people,
we
think
they
are
not
irrelevant.
we
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
there
is
enough
to
give
them
standing
to
raise
the
issue.
it
certainly
was
enough
for
the
trial
judge
to
permit
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
against
them.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
judge
goodman
offered
the
--
permitted
the
evidence
against
him
to
be
received.
he
said,
"well,
they
were
there."
and
if
it
was
certainly,
if
it
was
enough
to
hold
them
responsible
in
a
criminal
sense,
the
evidence
could
be
use
against
them
is
certainly
is
enough
to
give
them
standing
to
make
the
objection
now.
we
don't
--
mr.
norman
leonard
some
was.
i
think
that
the
tail
end
of
the
list
mr.
justice
harlan
you
will
find
some
notation
of
--
of
some
material
that
was
returned.
on
the
last
page
you
will
see
that,
i
know
for
the
fact
of
course
that
the
two
automobiles
were
finally
return
to
me
and
i
turn
them
over
to
the
people
to
whom
they
were
registered.
and
i
think
some
material
was
returned
to
mrs.
kremen.
yes,
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
the
italicized
page
19,
the
following
item
were
returned
to
shirley
kremen
et
cetera.
it's
a
photographed
records
and
--
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
sir.
if
i
have
any
time
mr.
chief
justice,
i
like
to
reserve.
mr.
norman
leonard
thank
you.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
was
going
to
--
i
think
the
record
reflects
it,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
(inaudible)
i
was
trying
to
make
that
point
in
my
response
(inaudible).
mr.
norman
leonard
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
leonard
if
the
court
please,
i
think
perhaps
i
should
first
try
to
clear
up
this
matter
of
those
motions
to
suppress
and
what
happened
to
them.
if
the
court
will
examine
the
record
at
page
22,
it
appears
that
on
march
26,
1954,
shirley
kremen
filed
a
motion
to
suppress.
this
is
one
of
those
in
the
series
and
she
specifically
refers,
it
appears
on
page
22
to
the
books,
papers
closing
documents
and
other
tangible
objects
which
were
taken
from
the
residence
which
was
then
and
there
list
(inaudible).
now,
on
page
89
of
the
record,
that
motion
is
called
up
for
a
hearing,
motion
to
suppress
evidence
and
that's
the
motion
on
april
5th,
1954.
now
following
the
record
through
if
we
turn
to
page
139,
we
find
what
happened
to
that
hearing.
cunsel
says
there
is
a
minute
order
in
the
record
indicating
a
stipulation
to
take
it
off
calendar.
i
don't
know
how
it
got
into
the
record
because
what
happened
is
reflected
at
page
139
that
the
conclusion
of
the
technical
testimony
that
day,
the
matter
was
continued
till
the
next
morning.
a
witness
apparently
weren't
available
and
you
will
see
that
it
was
further
continued
until
9:30
o'clock
a.m.
on
april
13th.
that
explains
those
minute
entries
that
showed
that
on
april
13th,
the
motion
was
heard.
if
you
turn
to
page
164,
you
will
see
that
on
april
13th,
there
were
further
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
pursuant
to
the
continued.
mr.
norman
leonard
page
164.
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
the
trial
had
started
the
day
before
(voice
overlap)
consciously
suspended
the
trial
for
one
day
to
continue
further
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
suppress
because
the
witness
hadn't
been
available
and
you
will
see
the
statement
of
the
government
attorney,
mr.
(inaudible).
if
your
honor
please,
the
government
has
agreed
to
provide
the
witnesses,
here
they
are
and
we
go
ahead.
and
his
witnesses
were
not
the
witnesses
solely
to
the
blau
motion
because
he
goes
right
on
ahead
and
talks
about
a
witness
having
information
concerning
matters
at
the
twain
harte
cabin,
that
was
ericsson.
and
that
both
motions
were
heard
that
morning
and
that
explains
judge
goodman's
ruling
in
the
minute
order
that
the
motions
--
motions
are
denied,
they
were
both
--
i
think
if
your
honors
--
mr.
norman
leonard
that
appears
on
page
73,
the
court
made
the
minute
actually
there,
mr.
justice
burton
under
the
date
of
april
13th,
further
hearing
on
motions
to
suppress
evidence,
et
cetera.
after
argument,
each
of
said
motions
was
ordered
denied,
page
73.
mr.
norman
leonard
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
norman
leonard
yes,
your
honor,
certainly.
mr.
norman
leonard
i
suppose
that
judge
goodman
tells
the
clerk.
if
your
honor
please
the
--
your
honors
please
the
matter
of
this
memorandum
that
was
filed
by
counsel
--
unless
the
court
desires
me
too,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
respond
in
--
in
--
in
those
cases
i
looked
at
them
last
night,
the
motions
were
not
made
before
trial
as
this
record
shows
this
four.
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case
i
--
mr.
norman
leonard
exactly.
exactly
and
this
court
said
in
(inaudible),
"the
objection
to
the
seizure
was
plainly
an
afterthought."
you
can't
say
from
this
record
that
our
objection
in
seizure
was
plainly
an
afterthought
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
raise
this
in
its
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
didn't
raise
it
before
judge
goodman,
i
suggest
nothing
fictitious
that
this
is
plainly
an
afterthought
on
their
part
to
prevent
this
court
from
reaching
the
merits
of
this
utterly
unwarranted
search
and
seizure.
finally,
in
response
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
answer
is
clear.
i
think
counsel
has
conceded
it
that
under
the
amendment,
if
the
seizure
or
the
search
was
unreasonable,
there
is
no
justification
for
them
taking
out
something
and
saying
it
was
reasonable.
thank
you.
